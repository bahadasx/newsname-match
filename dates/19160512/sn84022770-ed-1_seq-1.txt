INJURED PRISONERS
MAY SUE county
MAN RUNS AMUCK IN JAIL, STAB
BLNG THREE INMATES BE
FORE OVERPOWERED.
Damages against Thurston county
and Sheriff Fred W. McCorkle may
result from the fracas which occur-
red in the county jail about 1 o'clock
Tuesday morning when Ernest Reiscb
38 years old, ran amuck and, using'
a large pocket knife, stabbed and se
verely cut three other prisoners, Wil
liam Thompson, J. W. Miller and
Fred Kusah. Reisch was not search
ed when locked in the jail by Deputy
Sheriff Jack Glfford.
Reisch's attack was made without
warning and without provocation,
when the three prisoners and J. F.
Gillies, the other inmate of the jail,
were sleeping. Reisch first attacked
Thompson, who was sleeping in the
bunk above him, stabbing him twice
in the back of the neck. Thompson
called to his fellow prisoners for
help. Miller and Kusah responding
while Gillies ducked under the bed.
They were unable to turn on the
lights before Reisch attacked them
and the fight with the maniac was
carried on in the dark, until he was
finally overpowered.
Injured Men at Hospital.
Game Warden Fennell, who sleeps
at the jail, was unable to assist in
overpowering Reisch, as he had no
keys. He called Sheriff McCorkle
and Drs. H. W. and K. L. Partlow
were also called to treat the injured
men, who were then removed to the
hospital. They are still confined
hospital. Kusah and Thompson were
injured the worst, and were weak
from loss of blood, but Improved so
they could be removed to the county
jail Thursday. The fact that Reisch's
knife was dull doubtless saved their
lives.
Reißch, who was considerably bat
tered up, was tried before a sanity
commission in the superior court la
ter that morning and committed to
the Steilacoom asylum, where he was
taken Tuesday evening. His story
was that the other prisoners had
"tried to get" him.
Eeisch was first arrested in Shel
ton last week, because of his peculiar
actions in that vicinity. He was
brought to Olympia last Friday, but
as both Sheriff McCorkle and Deputy
Jack Glfford were out of the city at
the time, he was turned over to the
city police and spent that night in
the city jail. Saturday morning he
was turned over to Deputy Gifford
by Chief Caton, Sheriff McCorkle be
ing Seattle, and the deputy failed to
search him before he locked him in
the county bastile, assuming that the
elty authorities had done so. They
had, but had returned Reisch's be
longing* to him.
Injured When a Boy.
Relsch had been making his home
with his mother, brother and sister
near Kamilche, where his brother
owns a ranch, and his brother had
Tlsited him at the local Jail. The
county authorities, investigating the
man's history, report that they learn
he has been mentally unbalanced
since he was struck on the head with
a hammer when 14 years old, by a
shoemaker to whom he had been ap
prenticed at his home in the old
country. Tuesday morning was the
first time, however, that he had ever
become violent. He had made his
home with his brother for the last 10
years.
Thompson, one of the Injured men,
is the alleged brass thief who tried
to break away from Policeman La-
Barre last week; Miller Is the con
tractor who Is held on a charge of
stealing logs from a timber tract
near Hogum Bay, and Kusah Is the
man arrested In Tenlno for stealing
a belt from one of the mills there.
Auditor li«ts Bowers Go.
County Auditor Annie Gaston this
week announced that L. L. Bowers of
Little Rock had been relieved of his
duties as deputy sealer of weights
and measures for this county, a place
he has filled for the last three years,
•nd that the work would be per
formed hereafter by R. A. Cruik
shank, deputy auditor. Bowers will
still serve as wide tire inspector, how
ever. The change means a reduction
°f S6O a month In the payroll of the

HOPE TO START
TESTING MONDAY
ORGANIZATION OF COW-TESTING
ASSOCIATION HERE IS NOW
COMPLETED.
Testing of the milk production of
cows owned by members of the Thur
ston County Cow-Testing association
is to be inaugurated next Monday,
unless W. S. Thornber, director of
the extension division of the- Pull
man State College, fails to supply by
that time the expert who is to con
duct the official testing.
The association was finally organ
ized and officers elected at a meet
ing of the members in this city last
Saturday, and O. E. Gibson, the gov
ernment organizer, was instructed to
advise Mr. Thornber to put a man on
the job here by May 15. Up to
Thursday the officers of the associa
tion had not heard from the Pull
man official but were confident that
the official tester would be appointed
in time to begin the work next Mon
day.
L. R. Campbell of South Union,
president of the Dairymen's associa
tion and prime mover in the forma
tion of the cow-testing association,
was elected president of the latter
organization last Saturday; C. C. As
pinwall of Mud Bay vice president,
and Charles IS. Starr, also of Mud
Bay, secretary-treasurer. These
three, with D. J. Bigelow, A. H. Kais
er, John Hackman and Fred Sleater,
all well known farmers of the county,
compose the board of trustees.
Arrangements have been made so
that members of the association can
make their first quarterly payment
of dues to Frank M. Kenney, cashier
of the Olympia National bank. Pres
ident Campbell announces. Mr.
Kenney will furnish the members
with receipts and will turn the mon
ey over to llr. Starr, the secretary
treasurer of the association. This
arrangement was effected to make
it more convenient for members to
pay their dues, which must be paid
by June 1, according to the by-laws
of the association.
President Campbell also announc
es that the Dairymen's association
will meet at the Chamber of Com
merce at 1 o'clock Saturday after
noon, May 20, and the members of
the cow-testing association are in
vited to attend. Now that this or
ganization is a reality, the Dairymen
will probably take up the feeding
question, which will also include the
discussion of silos.
McKlnley School to Re-open.
After having been closed for two
weeks, during which the building
was thoroughly fumigated and the
threatened epidemic of scarlet fever
in the neighborhood was put under
control, the McKinley school will be

INVESTIGATE PLANS TO
CELEBRATE JULY FOURTH
Chamber of Commerce Receives Pro
posal for Four-Day
Event.
Plans for a big Fourth of July cel
ebration in this city, to be staged for
three or four days, were discussed at
a general meeting of the member
ship of the Chamber of Commerce
Monday evening, when President P.
M. Troy was authorized to appoint a
committee to consider the proposal
further.
This committee will probably be
appointed within the next day or two
and will discuss final arrangements
with an amusement promoter who has
offered to assist in the celebration.
The program, as suggested by him,
contemplates the election by popular
vote, in a contest during June, of a
Goddess of Liberty, who will be
crowned July 2 and have full sway
during the four days' celebration,
which is to begin Saturday, July 1,
with the opening of a midway, a
baseball game, and a band concert.
Sunday the band is to give a sacred
concert, according to the proposed
schedule, and Monday there is to be
a balloon ascension, a baby carriage
parade with prizes for the best dec
orated carriage, and a civic parade
for the schools, lodges and merchants,
when prices for the best floats will
be given. In the afternoon there is
proposed a baby contest; in the early
evening a first aid and safety first
exhibition, and later a fireworks dis
play.
Tuesday, the Fourth, is proposed
as the big day of the celebration. In
the morning a merchants' parade, to
be participated in also by lodges
and autoists, is suggested, a public
wedding contemplated, and in the
afternoon and evening a street dance
and mardi gras, with fireworks.

Fog Saves Fruit and Berries.
The fog which settled over this
section shortly after midnight Wed

there was a heavy hail storm, ac
companied by some snow.

MAY 18 REGISTRATION
MY AT SOUTH UNION
Voters of County Precinct to Hold
First Affair of Kind In State.
Something of an innovation is to
be tried out in the South Union vot
ing precinct in the form of a regis
tration day picnic to be held near
the hall next Thursday, May 18. It
will be the first affair of its kind in
the state, so far as known.
This has been planned to over
come as far as possible the difficulties
placed in the way of the farmers'
vote, and the signing of the initia
tive petitions through the new re
quirement that the farmers must reg
ister, as well as city residents.
Through such a special observance
it is believed that a large registra
tion will be stimulated, while other
wise the new duty, considered by
many to be irksome, might be over
looked.
It is hoped that every voter in the
precinct will attend, register, sign
the petitions, bring a lunch, have a
good picnic dinner, hear the ad
dresses which various Olympia
speakers have promised and have a
good time, all in one day.
NORTON BROUGHT BACK.
Safecracker Again Held at Montesano
Jail—Robbed Rainier Depot.
Solomon Goldberg, alias Joe Nor
ton, who last October blew the safe

Rainier and Montesano and later
broke out of the Montesano jail, fol
lowing his arrest in this county, is
again in the Grays Harbor jail, Sher
iff Matthews of that county having
returned with him this week from
Oklahoma.
Goldberg was arrested by North
ern Pacific detectives and lodged in
the local Jail over night, being then
taken to Montesano. After his es
cape from that bastlle, he was next
heard from In Alabama, where he
serving a short sentence for a minor
ofTense. He broke away from a con
vict gang in a coal mine there, also,
but was finally caught at Oklahoma

Heavy Logging Train Jumps Track
• Near Delphi Wednesday.
Two crews of men are working
night and day to repair the damage
caused Wednesday afternoon when a
heavily loaded logging train on the
Thurston County railroad in the Mud
Bay district, jumped the track on the
line near Delphi, wrecking four heavy
cars, tearing the rails for a distance
of 100 yards and scattering logs along
the track. The damage amounts to
several thousand dollars.
The train was travelling toward
Mud Bay at a fair rate of speed at the
time and a remarkable feature of the
accident was that no workmen were
injured. The heavy engine was stop
ped before it reached the broken por
tion of the track. The wreckage has
closed the Waddle Creek wagon road
temporarily and the accident may
force several mills to shut down for a
short time, owing to a shortage of
logs.
MOUND PRAIRIE CLUB
DEDICATES NEW HOME
GOVERNOR PRINCIPAL SPEAKER
AT ELABORATE EXERCISES
THURSDAY.
With Governor Lister as the guest
of honor and principal speaker, Pres
ident P. M. Troy of the Chamber of
Commerce delivering Olympia's mes
sage, and other prominent speakers
from Centralia and Chehalis on the
program, the members of the Mound
Prairie Farmers' club dedicated their
new home at Essex, a mile north of
Grand Mound, with elaborate exer
cises Thursday afternoon.
The dedicatory program began at
2:30 and occupied the greater part
of the afternoon, and in the evening
young and old people of the neigh
borhood joined in dancing. The slo
gan of the day was "The prairie's
right when handled right," and the
ceremonies attracted a large crowd.
Purpose of the Club.
The club is instituted to study ag
ricultural conditions of the South
west Washington gravelly prairie
lands. The men and women com
posing it have decided, after four
years of experimentation, that this
prairie land, scientifically handled,
will prove sufficiently fertile to war
rant its cultivation and settling by
large numbers of small ranch hold
ers.
Their greatest problem, at the
present time, is the profitable mar
keting of produce. The club has
just erected a very nice building
which is to be devoted chiefly to this
problem and to matters of communi
ty welfare generally.
This club was organized May 6tb
last year and has a membership of
•1 earnest men and women who are
accustomed to labor hard with both
their hands and their beads, and any
thing they attempt to do is something
entirely practicable.
The Club's Officers.
Mr. F. W. Nye, a poultryman, is
the president; E. C. Dens, vice pres
ident; W. 8. Whipple, treasurer, and
C. L. Drake, secretary.
That the extent of the gravelly
prairie lands makes their proper de
velopment a matter of statewide in
terest is evidenced by the interest
taken in the activities of this club
by Governor Ernest Lister, who at
tended the exercises Thursday and
delivered the dedicatory address.
This evidence of the state's attention
to their doings will prove one of the
best of incentives toward a continu
ance of the work so officially sanc
tioned.
New District for Offut Lake.
County Superintendent O. C. Ooss
Thursday gave an order forming a
new school district in the Offut Lake
neighborhood, as petitioned for by
the residents of that vicinity. The
new district Is a compromise, com
posed of parts of Districts Nos. 15,
45 and 47, and given enough of the
section In which the railroad prop
erty is located to make Its valuation
approximately $ 140,000. The pro
posed change was discussed In a pub
lic hearing before Superintendent
Goss last Monday, when Plum Sta
tion residents objected to any re-ar
rangement which would take the rail
road property from their district and
so reduce its assessed valuation.

GREETED MUBLV
GOVERNOR APPOINTS WILSON,
OLSON AND GILL ON INDUS
TRIAL COMMISSION.
General commendation and ap
proval has been voiced on all sides
over the appointment by Governor
Lister Wednesday of Assistant At-
torney General John M. Wilson,
State Labor Commissioner E. W. Ol
son and Deputy State Bank Exam
iner F. I. Gill as members of the In
dustrial insurance commission suc
ceeding Floyd L. Daggett, A. B.
Ernst and Clarence Parker.
The new officials take charge of
the department June 1 and a com
plete re-organization of the system
in vogue there will be made, to pre
vent as nearly as possible the re
currence of such frauds as looted the
departmental funds of some $20,000
and resulted in the conviction of J.
F. Gillies, former chief claim agent.
Rumors that the personnel of the
commission would be changed in a
"clean sweep" by the governor had
been current for some time and were
given official recognition upon the
governor's return last Friday from
an Eastern Washington trip. Then
he announced that successors to Com
missioners Daggett, Ernst and Par
ker would be named.
Parker First to Resign.
Up to that time he had not re
ceived the resignations of any of the
commissioners, and all three had
previously denied any intention of
resigning. Mr. Parker, however,
presented bis resignation after a con
ference with the governor Saturday,
and Commissioner Ernst's was re
ceived from Seattle Wednesday.
The chairman of the new commis
sion was not designated by the gov
ernor, but will be chosen by these of
ficials when the new board Is organ
ized. The appointees all have ex
cellent reputations for ability and
capacity in handling the affairs of
the different departments from which
they are promoted, and will enter
upon their new duties with the con
fidence of the public generally.
E. W. Olson has made an enviable
record as state labor commissioner
during the last three years, reviving
and revitalizing the work of that de
partment, putting into operation the
minimum wage, the eight-hour pub
lic works and the women's eight
hour laws, increasing the efficiency
and work of the factory inspection
department and inaugurating many
new features of departmental activ
ity, including the establishment of
safety committees in many of the
mills and factories of the state,
which have effectively reduced the
number of accidents to workmen.
His administration of the depart
ment has been generally praised
both by labor leaders and by employ
ers ard his work there has been close
ly allied to that of the industriat in
surance department.
Gill an Accountant.
F. I. QIU was appointed a deputy
in the state bank examiner's office
nearly three years ago, after year*
of experience in the banking bus
lness and is an expert accountant.
His work as examiner has taken him
to most of the state banks of Wash
ington and among the officers of
these institutions, who know him
and his work, he is generally com
mended.
John L. Wilson is well known to
Thurston county residents, having
served as prosecuting attorney for
two terms, and he is known through
out the state as the man who con
ducted the trials, for the state, of J.
P, Gillies, resulting in Gillies' con
viction of forgery and grand larceny
and his sentencing to the state pen
itentiary for approximately seven
years. Mr. Wilson was appoint
ed an assistant attorney general
two years ago and since then has
acted as legal adviser for the indus
trial Insurance commission, so that
he 1s thoroughly familiar with tlie
work of the department.
Mr. Wilson is a Republican, while
Messrs. Olson and Gill are Demo
crats.
Appointments as commissioners
were offered J. D. Trenholme, a lead
ing Democrat of Seattle, and Attor
ney General W. V. Tanner, Governor
