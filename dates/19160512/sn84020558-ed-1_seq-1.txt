for much adverse criticism for its
handling of the Irish situation
especially for the executions that
followed the recent uprising.

been shot, for particioating in the
revolt but promisee", that court

EL PASO, Texas, May 11. After
almost two weeks of discussion
the conferences of Generals Scott,
Funston and Obregon over Ameri
can troop dispositions in Mexico
came to an end tonight without
any agreement being reached
The whole matter was referred
back to the Amerii-n and defacto
governments to be settled through
diplomatic cHannels.
Tonight the situation is almost
exactly where it stood before the
conferences began. The Mexican
government still insists on the
withdrawal of General Pershing's
columns upon a certain date and
wants that date to come quickly.
It is known that General Obregon
has been willing to make conces
sions fn order to reach an agree
ment with the American conferees.
He had been overruled, however,
by the first chief. Venustiano Car
ranza and his advisers. After
practically conceding the demands
of the American confrees, he was
compelled to reverse his attitude.
The end of the negotiations came to-
day after two conferences had been
held. The first at ten o'clock in tho
: morning and lasted until 1 p. ni.. when
' a recess was taken until four o'clock,
to permit Cetieral Obregon. to keep a
I lunch engagement.
