MIDDLEBURY LOSES TO SPRING-
FIELD.
In the most interesting gamo of tho
ycar up to dato Middlebury forced
Springfield into ten innings to win on
Porter field last Friday. A Iarge crowd
was out to witness the first basebnll
gnme of Junior Week, and a good gamo
it was to witness. Springfield had won
from the University of Vermont on the
day before by a score of 190.
Springfield got a two bagger in tho
first, but tho runner went no further,
the side retiring on two infield drives
handled by Bowers and Dewhirst and a
strike out. Middlebury started things
atonce, Bower gottinga liit between
first and second. Brickett sacrificed,
Bresnahan got on by an error and
Aylward's long fly enabled Bowers to
score. Bresnahan stole second and
third, but was left there at the close of
the inning. Middlebury got a run in
each the second nnd the third, and held
Springfield scoreless through the flrst,
four innings. In the fifth a base on
balls, a single, and a home run netted
Springlleld two runs and one in the
sixth tied the score. The tie lasted
through the seventh and eighth, but in
the ninth a pass, a single, a sacrifice
hit andan error gave Springfield a lead
of two. Bullis.a pinch hitter.'for Middle
bury got a double, and a single by
Brickett and one by Bresnahan tied the
score. In the tenth Springfield got two
more and in her half Middlebury was
unable to score, giving Springfield the
game.
Crippen was in his usual regular hot
weather form and kept the Springfield
team guessing, getting five strike outs
against four by Brown, the visiting
pitcher. Sears took third base in the
5th inning when Breseahan sprained
his ankle. Brickett caught a good
game. The score :

A fast, exciting and close game of
baseball at Burlington, resulting in a
victory for the Middlebury team, should
call out the fans for Tuesday, May 1G,
when Burlington High school plays at
Middlebury.
The game at Burlington was full of
snappy plays, close decisions and fine
ball playing. Middlebury was ahead all
the time, but it took hard playing to
keep there.
