the homestead laws.
Soon Finish Troy Line
The poles for the power line be
tween Kendrick and Troy have all
been raised and work will begin
Monday stringing the wires. It is
only a matter of a few days now
until Troy and Kendrick will both
be getting light and power from
the Potlatch Electric Company's
plant.
All the business houses that are
wired are being connected up and
there will probably be night ser
vice only until Troy is connected,
and then night and day service will
be a regular thing.

TRIAL JURORS
Veniremen Ordered not
Report
to
Statewide prohibition has re
legated the bootlegger to the tall
and distant timber in Idaho, at least
his activities since the new law was
placed into effect have been on the
wane and one forceful result of this
is shown in the fact that but few liq
uor violations have occurred either
in selling to Indians or in taking it
on the Nez Perce Indian reservation.
As a result the federal grand jury
completed its limited labors Wednes
day and Judge Dietrich announced
that the federal trial jury, scheduled
to report Wednesday would not be
called owning to the very few cases
under consideration. The U. S.
marshall was instructed to notify
the federal jurors not to appear.
Judge Dietrich sentenced John Kim
ball to serve 60 days in the Latah
county jail and to pay a fine of $100.
He was indicted at the present
session and pleaded guilty Tuesday.
L. G. Peterson a Delegate
Attorney L. G. Peterson departed
on the Wednesday afternoon train
for his trip to the meeting of the
General Assembly of the Presbyter
ian Church, which convenes at
Atlantic City, N. J., on May 18th,
for a session of ten days.
Mr. Peterson expects to be absent
for five or six weeks, and on his way
east will stop at Minneapolis, Chi
cago, Washington, D. C., and Phil
adelphia. He will return by the
way of New York City, thence by
boat up the Hudson to Albany, and
by rail to Buffalo and Niagara Falls,
then by boat across Lake Erie to
Detroit, then by rail to Chicago,
where he expects to take in the
National Republican Convention,
; and visit relatives. He will also

KENDRICK CREAMERY
INCREASES OUTPOT
The Business is in a Flourish
ing Condition
W. S. MacCloy, who promoted
and sold stock in the Kendrick Co
operative Creamery last spring, was
a visitor in Kendrick Monday. He
came here for the purpose of in
vestigating the condition of the
plant and reports that out of
the fourteen creameries that he has
established during the past year,
the one in Kendrick has made by
far the best progress. Mr. Mac
Cloy was more than pleased with
the out-put of the creamery and
said that the increase from 160
pounds a week to 1500 pounds a
week within one year was very en
couraging.
Mr. MacCloy advises grading the
cream so that bitter cream or a
quality high in bacteria might be
docked a cent a pound. This would
be an incentive to the producer to
send a good grade into the creamery
in order to take advantage of the
higher price. He said the quality
of butter being made here was good
but that by using the moisture test
an increase might be made in the
amount of water and salt used. The
law allows 16 per cent moisture and
4 per cent salt while the local pro
duct has tested 14 per cent mois
ture and 2 per cent salt.
He believes that more attention
should be paid by the farmers to
the value of buttermilk as feed for
pigs and chickens. At the price
that this by-product may be secured,
it is very cheap feed and produces
great results when fed with grain
or in connection with green feed.
Mr. MacCloy states emphatically
that before the dairy business in
the Potlatch will produce the max
imum of profit, silos must be built.
He is a practical dairy man and has
made a success of the business so
that his suggestions should carry
weight. The farmers who have
built silos on their farms in this
vicinity are well pleased with the
results attained. They are no
longer an experiment but a real
practical, money-making investment
and every farmer who keeps a few
hogs and two or three head of
cattle can get big returns from the
money invested in a silo.
New Barber Shop
Percy MacKenzie has rented the
rooms formerly occupied by
Jess
Riley and is installing the fixtures j
for his barber shop. He has had j
the inside of the rooms calcimined !
and the woodwork re-painted and
expects to have his equipment
ready for business soon.
BALL GAME
AT LAPWAI
One More Defeat for
Local Team
the
The Keudrick baseball team play
ed their second game with Lapwai,
on the Lapwai grounds Sunday
afternoon. The Indians again de
feated the local team by rather a
lopsided score. The Lapwai team
piled in 12 runs and Kendrick had
to be satisfied with 3. N
It is no disgrace for a ball team
to be defeated by the Indians for
they sure can play ball. They have
any amount of time to practice and
use most of their time for that pur
pose beginning early in the spring
before any of the other teams
around the country are even think
ing of baseball.
Hill pitched the game and Forrest
caught. They make a dandy battery
and all they need is a little better
support. Hill allowed but six hits,
so that errors were responsible for
the big score.
Following are the names of those
who played in the game: Bechtol,
Compton, Jones, Forrest, Hill, Weg
ner, McCrea, Candee, Bolen.
The Kendrick team has a game
scheduled with Uniontown for next
Sunday.

WORK PROGRESSING
ON THE ELEVATOR
Soon be Ready for Concrete
Work
Ten men are working on the ele
vator for the Kendrick Rochdale
Co. The pit is nearly finished and
it is quite a sizable hole. It had to
be dug through gravel and rock
and required a great deal of labor.
Some pretty fair sized boulders
were unearthed in the process of
digging the pit.
The contract for the concrete
work was given to Alloway & Georg
of Spokane. They have the forms
on the ground and are setting them
up to be ready to start building
the four big storage tanks as soon
as the pit has been completed. The
work is progressing nicely and it
will not be long until the concrete
will begin pouring into the forms.
Part of thfe machinery has already
arrived. A number of big iron pul
leys are here and they will be used
in the elevator shaft to run the
belts that hoist the grain from the
pit into storage tanks.
The machinery will all be run by
power supplied by the Potlatch
Electric Co. Two 10-horse motors
have already arrived. One of them
is to be used to run the elevator
and will be installed at the top of
the storage tanks and the other will
run the machinery and will be on
the ground floor. A man standing
on the ground floor can control all
of the machery connected with the
elevator by turning the switches.
This elevator is another mark of
the progressiveness of the Potlatch
farmers. It it one of the first being
built in this part of the country
and only goes to show that the far
mers in this vicinity do not follow
the lead of others but have enough
initiative of their own to take the
lead in anything that will improve
conditions in the Potlatch.
Ptomaine Poisoned
Quite a number of the young
people of Kendrick planned to go
on a picnic to Atwater lake last
Saturday. They expected to leave
town in the afternoon Saturday and
return Sunday evening.
Most of the young ladies who had
planned to go, attended an ice cream
social Friday afternoon. The ice
cream was evidently poisoned from
contact with rusty spots inside the
freezer, for a number of the young
lädies became quite ill. It was
whispered by some that the pto
maine poisoning was an intervention
of Divine Providence to breakup
! „ , . . , . .» ..
the Sunday picnic but lf s0 ' *
proved to be an unnecessary pre
caution as it rained most all even
ing Saturday.
Navel-ill In Colts
Quite a number of colts in this
vicinity have died with the disease
k nown as navel-ill or blood-poison
* ng- Several days after the colt is
born, it loses its appetite, and grows
stiff. The joints swell up and in a
few days the colt dies. The navel
cord is found to be purplish in
co * or and f u ^ °f pus -
The cause is pus germs.
The treatment is chiefly preven
tion:—Do not allow the mare and
CQ j t to rema i n j n the barn, where
, . , .. . , , D . . .,
tbe in f ectlon ,s found. Paint the
navel with tincture of iodine. In
the first stage of the disease it can
be successfully handled by a veteri
narian who will use vaccines and
blood tonics.

PAPER PRICES
GOING HIGHER
Demand becoming greater
than the supply
Paper of all kinds has advanced
price 50 to 100 per cent. In
some cases where a certain grade of
paper is desired the wholesale houses
will not even quote prices until the
paper is delivered. The conditions
in the middle states are even worse
than they are here. The demand is
so great, caused to some extent by
the consumers stocking up heavily
for fear of still higher prices, that
the paper houses are swamped with
orders, many of which they cannot
fill.
An eastern weekly paper ran out
of news print and had to borrow
enough to last a couple weeks until
an order, which had been in for two
months, arrived. There was no
definite prospect that the paper
could be secured at the end of two
weeks and no price would be quoted
until the paper was delivered.
One paper house gives the follow
ing explanation: "We are using
about ten per cent more paper every
day than is being manufactured in
this country. Unfortunately two
or three large mills are going to
discontinue print paper to engage
in the manufacture of higher priced
paper. Still more unfortunate are
the food conditions in Wisconsin,
which has shut down several of the
print* mills, so there is almost a
famine on print paper at this mo
ment.
The prices on job printing will
necessarily have to be raised in the
same ratio as the advance in price
of paper. It is a question whether
the war prices are going to be
particularly beneficial to the people
in general. If everything is going
up in price, where is the gain?
Will Pemberton Hurt
Will Pemberton had a very pain
ful accident last Saturday. While
prying a rock loose on the ledge
behind the rock crusher the crow
bar slipped and he fell, striking
one side of his face on the rocks at
the base of the cliff. He also
bruised his left shoulder severely.
Fifteen stitches were taken to close
the cuts in his forehead and under
his left eye. The left eyelid was
badly lacerated and an operation
will probably be necessary later to
bring it back to its proper position.
The left side of his face is still quite
numb owing to the nerves being
severed.
Bechtol Installs Machine
Elmer Bechtol has installed a
band-saw, sanding machine, rip-saw
and mitre machine in the back of
his store. This machinery will all
be run by power and will enable the
Kendrick Furniture Co., to turn out
a much larger amount of work than
before. Mr. Bechtol is working up
a reputation on his shop made furni
ture and the increasing demand for
it made it necessary for him to in
stall the machinery.
Camp Fire Girls
The Camp Fire Girls met in the
Presbyterian church Saturday night
as usual. Thirteen girls were pre
sent. After the business matters
were discussed each girl told of a
kind deed she had done or seen done
since the last meeting. A program
was rendered by some of the girls.
Refreshments were served by Mrs.
Patton, Crystal May and Hattie
Rauschke.
