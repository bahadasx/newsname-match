EIGHTH GRADERS FAIL
At the recent examination
held in this county it is esti
mated that two-thirds of those
who took the examination
failed. In the Yaqunla district,
W. C. Fischer teacher, and in the
Rock Cieek district, Ray Dick
son teacher, all passed. In New
port two-thirds failed; in Toledo
all failed who took everything
and only two passed who were
exempt in a number of subjects.
There were about 150 In the
county who took the examina
tion. Supt. Coin says be thinks it a
mistake to allow the pupils to
have their Histories and Civil
Governments before them dur
ing the examinations, as it con
fuses them.

appropriate program was ren
dered, Miss Whitlaw having
given some time to the training
of the children and all did their
part splendidly. ' We were all

Qualifications of Mr. Moores
With pleasure we reprint the
following from Wednesday's

Mr. Hodkln that the HepubU

to elect Mr. Moores to the
office of RAorAtarv of fttntA
Old Friend Declare Him Excellently
Fitted For Secretary of State
Vancouver, Wash., May, 9th.
Prompted by an experience of 16
yeara of active clerical aorvlce In the
state departments at Salem, permit
me to refer to the peculiar fitness of
Honorable Charles B. Moores for the
office of Secretary of State, for which
he is the Republican candidate. I
have been intimately acquainted with
him for 46 years and know whereof I
speak. I congratulate the Republicans
of Oregon on their choice of a candi
date.
The name "Moores" is a synonym of
true-blue Republicanism. He comes
from good old Pioneer stork. He is a
self made man, whose public and pri
vate life is without spot or blemlBh.
He has had a varied experience In
the upbuilding of Oregon and Is thor
oughly familiar with its early history.
His legislative career has brought him
honor both as a clerical and presiding
officer He wields the pen of ready
writer and his contributions to the
press teem with interest. His person
al knowledge of Important events con-
I flArtAll with thA rnmmArrlnl ariiirn.
tlonal and political history of Oregon
has added very materially to the ar
chives of the state. He Is methodical
In his work and thoroughly reliable in
hit business dealings.
As a graduate of the Wllllamntte
University, his Inyallty to the institu
tion and his third of a century service
as a memember of Ita board of trus
tees, have brought him In close touch
with thousands of Its students now
scattored throughout the Northwent
Ills home life, his genial personality,
his connclnntlous discharge of public
duties, his loyalty to hlo friends and
his unswerving adherence to Repub
licanism as fathered and promulgated
by Lincoln, Grant and McKlnley, have
made his name and reputation a house
hold word in Oregon. His Intricate
knowledge of law will prove a valua
ble asset to the office. His uniform
courtesy Is probverblal and he Is what
the world calls a "good mixer." His
nomination and eloctlon to .the office
of Secretary of State will rebound to
the credit of the Republican party of
your commonwealth ana Insure to Its
citizens the services of a courteous,
cdlclnnt and economical officer.
The wotnnn of Oregon enpnclally owe
him a debt of grntitiulo for services he
hns rendered them In their struggle
hns rendered them In their struggle
for women suffrage. A legion of
friends outside of your state will re
joice In his election.

penal institutions, salaries
or omcers and help, sup
plies, and appropriations
made by the legislature,
mis makes up the state

of that year.
Q., Why are taxes higher In
some localities than they
are In others' In the same
