Than Ever Before.

Gerard Receives Unusual Marks of
Attention at Hands of Emperor
and Officials.
F(By the qum News Service.)
Brlin , ia Animstordam and London.
May 11.-The feeling of friendliness in
Germany toward the UnIteel States today
is such as has not existed since the Lusi
tania sank a year ago. This in true, both
of officiAl and unoffmeial circles of the
gnverrment. as well as of the press and
tie people. The end of the high tension
v h h so Often has threatened war in the
ist tw.lve months has broughit a real
foeting of relif -verywhere. There was
o manii. rtion of this new friendship
and cordia!ity vsterday when Ambas&a
dor Glerar,i leliv-rot the latest and pre
sitmnahle Ljt Amrian note In reply to
,!I, ( d ra ir. ation of Mlay 4 to Fir
"jt Minis!" an lagow. and conferred
for an hour aith hitm.
Thre will tbe no German answer to this
it. It is takex for granted that Pre'l
dent Wilson's reply settles the entire
question as it indicates that German's
declarations bave been accepted by the
1'nltell States.
There is, of course, behind the new
friendship a feeling thal the United
States will row. of its own accord. insist
upon securing Its rights from the allies.
but the German people are willing to
leave that to the American people.
The show of special friendliness by the
(ernian foreign office toward the Ameri
,an Embassy did much to allay popular
hostility in Germany. Then came the
invitation to Ambassador Gerard to visit
the Kaiser at the great army headquar
t-rs; his stay of four days there was un
procedented. No other Ambassador haa
hern similarly honored since the war be
ran. There were also cordial conferences
hetween Mr. Gerard and Chancellor von
Hethmann-Hlollweg before and after that
'iioi.
Since sending the note of May 4 the
German government has taken other steps
to show its desire to maintain the friend
liet relations wIth the United States. It
has issued an official denunciation of cer
tain attacks made upon Mr. Gerard per
sonally. More important still is the fact
that Germany has sent a note acknowl
edging responsibility for the torpedoing
of the Susex. 9

Cries of "shame' echoed through the

"At present," he continued, "everything

the provision that the wage scale, if

Oyster Bay, N. Y., May 1l.-el. Roose
elt has written a letter to the Roose
velt non-Partisanl League telling them
that he approves of the work they are
doing. The work they are doing is to
boom the Colonel for President. and his
letter, which is In reply to one from the
league saying that he is the only leader
under the issup of Americanism who has
any chance of being elected, is taken to
he a declaration that he is an avowed
candidate for the Republican and Pro

to give the lie to the reports that he
would support Justice Hughes. Senator
Root, or any other candidate except him
self.
Extracts from Col. Roosevelte letter
follow:
"I do not have to improve my con
victions on either Americanism or pre
paredness. I have fought for them all
my life long, and when I was President.
I translated my convictions concerning
them into governmental policy. The
events of the past two Years in Europe,
an of -the labn few or five yeos- f
Meico, have brought into vivid relief
the vital need of preparedness. And tbe
sinister revival of the politico-racial
hphen in our politics has emphasized the
need of stern insistence on thorough
going Americanism within our own
borders.
"Nineten years ago, when I was As
sistant Secretary of the Navy, I said:
'Preparation against war is the surest
guarantee for peace.' As yet no nation
can hold its place in the world or can do
any work really worth doing unless it
stands ready to guard its rights with an
armed hand.
"Your league emphasizes its devotion to
these principles. and supports me only
as representing these principles. This i
emphatically the proper attitude to take.
And because this Is your attitude, and
because you are working in this spirit
I very earnestly "prove your work.
"I am glad and proud, as an American.
that you are fearlessly and efficiently
backing those ideals.
