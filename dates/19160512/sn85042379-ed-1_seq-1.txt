VOLUME XIII
THE GLASGOW
%o
GLASGOW, VALLEY COUNTY, MONTANA, MAY 12, 1916.
NUMBER 2
BEGIN WORK ON
Excavating Started Thursday
Morning for Building.
WILL RUSH CONSTRUCTION
Expect to Have MiU Completed by
August. Spur Track Will
Be Built.
The excavation for the buildings of
the Glasgow Milling Company's big
300 barrel flour mill was started yes
terday morning, when J. L. Lytle,
who has the contract, put a- large
crew of men and teams on the job.
The site for the buildings was stak
ed out Wednesday afternoon by Mr.
Wm. Dunnell of the milling company,
and L. T. Stromswold, a contractor
of Minot, and the contract was let
for the excavating. . The contract
for the buildings has not been award
ed as yet, but it will be within the
next few days and the excavating
work will be rushed so that every
thing will be ready to start construct?
ing the buildings within the next few
weeks.
FT OUR Mil T
*
The articles of incorporation for
the company have been drawn and
will be filed immediately. The name
of the firm will be the "Glasgow Flour
Milling Co." and the brand of flour
they will manufacture at this millj
will be called the "White Cross." The
other mills operated by this company
have proven a wonderful success and
there is no reason why Glasgow should
not become the milling center of
Northern Montana within a few
years.
Wednesday night the City Council
allowed the petition of the company
for the construction of a spur track
from the G. N. right of way to the
mill site, and also granted ä build
ing permit to build a mill, elevator,
coal shed and flour house to cost $16.
000. This amount represents only the
cost of the buildings and does not in
elude the items of machinery
other equipment.
. A well is to be drilled near the mill
site and the water will be used in the
milling operations.
Mr. Dunnell expects to have the
mill completed by the first of August
and will make the trial runs during
that month, and it is the intention
of the company to be ready to handle
and buy grain this fall and to run the
mill to full capacity, twenty four
hours every day.

noon at the ball park to decide - the
championship of the Milk River Val

With conditions ideal for the meet,
a large crowd was on hand to wit-'
ness the events, and the keen rival-:
ry between the contestants made ev
ery race hard fought.
While Havre and Chinook were in
vited to send teams, they were unable
to come, and the meet became a
struggle between Glasgow, Malta andi*j
Culbertson for the first honors.
Owing to the large number of en
tries in the dashes, preliminary heats
were run off in the forenoon, which
left only the finals for the afternoon.
The surprise of the morning's per
formance came when Sektnan, the big
freshman of the Glasgow team, romp
ed in first in the 220. In the finals
in the afternoon he finished third

points and Bowers of Culbertson third
with 11. Heiland of Glasgow was
next with 7.
In the relay race, Glasgow won first
place, with a team consisting of Rog
ers, Heiland, Koppang and Lebert.
Culbertson was second and Malta
third in this event.
At 7:00 p. m. 'the contestants,

Complications in the North Dakota
gubernatorial contest are anticipated
with the probability that Sam Clark
of Bismarck soon will announce him
self a candidate for the Republican
nomination.
Clark's entrance will make the fight
a five-cornered affair, and may result
in many radical new alignments.
Clark has won the favor of the Ger

LAND RUSH ON IN
NORTH COUNTRY
7:05 A. M.
Hundreds of Filings on State Land
Near Glentana.
Another big land rush is on in the!
North Country this week and the ex
citement prevailing in Glentana calls
to mind the stories of the big stam
pedes for gold in the mining countries,
say3 t he Glentana Reporter. Every
body here, or almost everybody, has
gone i an d mad and filings are being
made as fast as the local U. S. Com
mig8 j oner ^ prepare the blanks and
take the oaths of the entrymen and
witnesses
The excitement has all been occa
sioned by the report'that the State!
|0f Montana is soon to lose its rights
to the vast area of land selected by
them last summer and that this land
w jn be thrown open to homeseaders
within a short time The land in
nuest ion lies between Glentana and
Sc obey and comprises approximately
ha if a million acres of as fine land as
can be found anywhere in the west.
j ust how much foundation there is
to the report, or where the report or-1
iginated, seems to be very vague in
the minds of the stampeders, but they
are filing just the same and seem to
feel that they will be among the for
tunate ones in securfng a piece of
this fine tract. It doesn't require
much effort to stir up a whole lot of
excitement in the west, where good
J land is concerned, and those who are,
the most enthusiastic are satisfied to
! take a chance on the meagre infor
Ration that has reached here.
The rush broke the first of the week
when Blaine Williams, a Plentywood
[real estate man, came through here
j and gave it out that he was locating
three hundred settlers on the big
state reserve and that late advices
from Washington convinced him that
is now out on $5,000 bonds.
the land would soon ' revert to the
government, subsequently to be thrown
open to homesteading .
The U. S. Commissioner at Glen
tana ran out of homestead blanks due
to the mad rush and an auto was dis
patched to Glasgow for more.
A great many of those who already
have homesteads are filing on half
sections over on the state land, with
hopes that the grazing homestead law
•will shortly go into effect and that
the filings now being made will give
them a preference right should the
land of their choice be designated by
the Secretary of the Interior as com
ing within the meaning of this pro
posed act.
O'RILEY JURY DISAGREES
' With ten jurors for acquittal and
two for conviction, the murder trial
of Barney O'Riley was brought to a
close at Chinook last week. O'Riley
The testimony showed that the
trouble between Secrest and O'Riley
and which ended in the shooting of
Secrest by O'Riley, started when O'
Riley interfered in a family row be
tween Secrest and his wife. Secrest
wanted to leave the dance and go
the two men engaged n a scuffle. On
the witness stand O'Riley raid he shot
Secrest in self defense after the lat
home and when Mrs. Secrest refused
jto accompany him, he proposed tak
{ n g their boy with him. At this point
O'Riley mixed in the argument and
. . —
ter had a hold on his throat.
Mrs. Secrest testified that she was
in the kitchen of the Kipp home when
t he fatal shot was find that ended
t he life of her husband.
The case was tried before Judge J.
w Tattan. County Attorney D. J.
Sias and D Wt Doyle of Great Fa n s
wre the attorneys for the "prosecu
tion, and the defense was represented
by Norris & Hurd of Great Falls and
Tressler & Kirton of Malta.

DISCUSS COUNTY
ROAD MATTERS
Members of State Highway Com
mission Here Monday.
PRAISE WORK DONE HERE
Valley County One of Few Counties
Which Buys Material Cheaply.
Road Work Boosted.
For the purpose of investigating
conditions here and also to give assist
ance to the County Commissioners on
road and bridge matters, the State
Highway Commission were here Mon*
•lay.
A. W. Mahon, Chairman, G. R. Mel
ton, Secretary and L. D. Conkling,
were the members of the commission
who were here to meet with the Coun
ty Commissioners. In the forenoon
road and bridge matters were dis
used and the members of the com
mission were taken into the country
to view the work that was being done
on roads and bridges in the county.
In the afternoon a general meeting
was held in the court room, and al
though the attendance was small,
those who were present derived much
valuable information from the talks
of the speakers.
Monday evening a smoker was held
in the Commercial Club rooms, at
which the County Commissioners and
members of the Highway Commis
sion were guests of the club. While
there were not many members pre
sent, those in attendance spent a very
enjoyable evening and listened to
some very interesting talks from al^
three members of the commission.
Mr. A. W. Mahon, the chairman of
the Highway Board, outlined the ob
ject and aim of the commission api<f
stated what the commission was try
ing to do and what it had already
done for the benefit of the. taxpayers
of the state and cited the good that
c_an be done by the commission with
the co-operation of the various boards
* county commissioners of the state.
Mr. G. R. Metlen, secretary of the
commission gave a very concise state-j
ment of the work accomplished dur
ing the short time the commission has|
been in existence and cited instances
wherein the commission had been of
very great value to various boards,
of commissioners in assisting them
to secure material at a very large
saving over the prices which had pre
vailed previous to the existence of the
Highway Commission, and compli
men ted Valley county upon the factj
that in one instance alone of steel
culverts, this county was paying a
considerable lower price than most
of the other counties of the state and (
a good deal less than the average:
price paid by all the counties. He,
dted cases where they found pnees
for culverts ranged from 6% cents in
some counties to 13 cents iti other
counties. Valley county was placed .
nearly at the bottom of the list of
counties, in the pnees for material, |
which shows that our commissioners^
are exercising true economy in this
regard. |
Mr. Metlen spoke of the enormous j
amount of roads which had been laid
out by Valley county during the P^t 1
year, which amounts to 800 miles, and |
also complimented the commissioners
on the saving to the county from the
fact that in all of that 800 miles, they
had not paid for any right of way.
Prof. Leon D. Conkling in a rhort
talk spoke of the great benefits de
rived from having trunk lin * roads
running north a»;d s^uth and I anit •
west throUi l> i;he ' unty anl .nc:os>
the state, and that one of the objects |
of the commission is to assist in lay-1
ing out these roads in such a way as
to give the greatest possible conven- !
ienceience with the least amount of
cost. He spoke of the bill now in
congress providing for $100,000,000 to
be set aside for use in road building
in all of the states. It provides for
a graduated amount to be spent an
nually beginning with $10,000,000 the
first year and gradually increasing to
$25,000,000 the fifth year, whereby
state highways will be created. Mon
tana will be in position to receive a
good portion of this fund if the bill
passes and the highway commission
ers can help each county in the dis
tribution of this portion of the fund.
Short talks were made also by mem
bers of the county board of commis
sioners and members of the Commer
cial Club and by County Surveyor W.
H. Mann.
timely and humorous.
""VILLIAGE SKEWL" MAKES HIT
Acting in the capacity of school
trustees, the audience at the perform
ânee of the "Villiage Skewl" at the
Orpheum Theatre Tuesday night put
their stamp of approval on the per
formance of the "Skewl" mistresses
and scholars.
Given under the auspices of the
ladies of the First Congregational
church and produced under the direc
tion of Mrs Memminger-Keith, the
play was successful from every stand
point. The ladies netted a neat «"■
from the receipts, which would have
been greatly augmented but for the
windy weather on the night of the
pfcy.
To Mrs. Keith belongs the lion's
Share, of the credit for the splendid
performance. For the past three
weeks she has been rehearsing and
getting ready for the play, and that
her efforts bore fruit is evidenced by
the excellent manner in which the
play was presented Tuesday night
Credit is also due to the members
of the cast whose faithful work in
preparing for the play and whose ex
cellent performance on the night of
presentation marks them as thespians
of no mean caliber.
The solos rendered by Miss Made
line Parker, were excellent and the
piano duets by Mrs. Keith and Mrs.
Cottrell brought such applause from
the audience that an éneore was ne
cessary after each piece.
The "eight finne menne singers"
made a big hit when they appeared
in .'chool-boy costume and sang sev
eral songs. Bert Hauge gave an ad
dress on "Patriotism" which was«both
4k< solo by Dr. Layton was very
pleasing, and the songs and dances
of ,the school girls was one of the
big features of the evening. The per
formance was brought to a close with
a butterfly dance, beautifully execut
