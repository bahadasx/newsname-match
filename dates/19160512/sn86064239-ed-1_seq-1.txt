History has been niaklug to rapid
ly 'for several daya In Mexico and
nlong thy border that notblnf abort
I of a dally paper can carry full re
' potts to Ihe public.
At tills time last week the press
' reports from the Scott-Obregon coo
' ference nt Jaurei nijd Kl Paso Id
d lea led Hint the two generals had
practically agreed that the soldiery
of the two governments would co
operate for the elimination of the
hnndlt elements nnd that after Mex
ico is considered aide to maintain
order thi' American troop win Id be
; v, Ilhdniu n.
The administration at Washington
approved this agreement, but Gen.
Ohregon said he would not sign up
till he beard from Carransa
Time wore on and no word of
sanction r.-ime from the defacto prea
; ident and people began to suspect
treachery on the purl of Obregon. It
I was auggested that he was Maying
for time to dispose his armlet at
j vantage points In Mexico, and fears
were felt for the safety of tbe Amer
i Iran troops on Mexican soil.
In proof of the soundness of this
S iiusptclon a band of Mexicans about
j 200 strong crossed into Texas In the
I Hlg Hend district on the Nlo Crude
I last Friday night and made dead I r
attacks on throe small villages. At
I Glenn Springs there were sine sol
jdlers stationed The stood off tbs
Mexicans in a desperate battle of five
1 hours. Three of the men were killed,
thtee oiliers wounded. The others
T-iiH't On this raid ten Americans
1 '.vere captured and carried Into Mex
ico ..tght of these escaped later and
' ' lime hark It Is thought tbe other
two are being held for ranrom.
It looks now like a general war
; w Ith Menir-o is inevitable.
It Is evident that the promise of
' Mexican co-operation Is out of the
uue-vtion. The people can no longer
plac confidence in Mexico's prom
ises. i I'rei.ii,-nt Wilson Is alive to the
; importance m rjuirh preparation for
border protection and the National
'Guaid" nine ht-en given hurry orders
fo tepoit to Gen Funston for no
l illzir.j: aior. the bonier. Thii order
will put 4.ono soldiers there with
aruix. anitiiunltlon andetulpment for
.1 long Seie
l.at Tu- sday evening President
.Wilton iMjei another order calling
out the mil i Ma of Ar'xona, New Mex
ico and I'i vas. and In lest than 24
hours these ropipanlt-a of stale troops
wvn- enioufe to the front Secretary
il.tker hnt'l.t that the original plan
of permission for troops to go Into
Mexico on "hot trails'' bolds good
and it is expected the forces In the
punitive expedition will be Increased
No call has yet come Irom Wash
'ington for volunteers, but when that
jmove becomes neeejt-ary we nay ex
j pert such a general response as will
(show to the Mexican leaders that
lAim-tiran blood is up and we will no
'longer submit to being hampered by
rules of International ethtrt nor rely
Ion diplomatic promises of Irrarher
lous officers. If the United States
" must ilitht. It will be fosnd that
Americans will gn about It with Just
as much energy and religious ferver
as e have displayed for three years
in dying to avoid It
