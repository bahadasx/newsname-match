Ntw Stories Told Of Mexican
Indignities
Wounded Americans Killed
on Field After Battle of Carrizal
Declare Returned Prisoners
WHO ARE "AMERICANS'!"'
Just now the press is fond of
using y-brasea like this: Ameri
can troops killed in Mexico,1'
'Mexicans ambush American
ioldiers," etc., using the name
"American" as though it applied
Duty to inhabitants of the United
States.
If the negro troops sent into
Mexico by the United States are
"Americans" then what are the
Yaqui Indians, who originated
in America and have never been
anywhere else? Who has the
better right to be called ''Amer.
irons' ' Mexicans whose, 'ancej
tors have lived and died here for
many hundreds of years or Uni
ted States soldiers who either
themselves or their parents were
born in Europe?
Such use of the name Amer
ican is merely one of the tricks
used by the United States labor
skinners to create prejudice and
induce slow-witted workingmen
to enlist and make war on real
Americans.
Who Wants
War?
QUESTION NO, 18.
NOTICE!!
Brother Garrett; Please ex
plain these scriptures:
In Zeph. 3-18. it says, "I will
gather them that are sorrowful
for the Solemn Assembly."
And in Joe! 2-15, It says:
"Blow the trumpet in Zion, sane
tify a fast cull a Solemn Assetn
bly." Who is tbis that will blow
theVuoapet ia Zion? Is it he
(bat will rule the nations with a
rod of iron, spoken of in Reve
lation, and the Deliverer' out of
Zion. Prank Moore,

. A call to arm's, to arms-The
theory and expression. Covering
the united State? at the present
time is off snd on to the war,
We must ask what forf The
answer must come. For a bloody
,nd Brutal' perpose. The Capit
als all want war,
Wall street New York want a
heavy preparedness. It is to the
interest of all Capitalists to have
war. Yet they are not going oat
in the field f battle to tight-But
their money wftl , hire one poor
man to 'go oul; to kill another
poorman' f
And with Jarf this hefore us,
we must say; that we agree with
JLpjppr men $ho do not want
warV For Bih'te pocialism are
bitterly opposd to it.
The American ( Labor move
ment is opposed to war, especia.
ly with Mexico. The political
socialist party and the American
Federation of lr bar have declair
eJIbetnscfves vTgorsbuty" oppos
ed to it.
And inspile of the Frantic
efforts of the capitalists and its
press to arouse a- spirit of war
on Mexico the people in general
are opposed to it and are calm.
r-The Cresset has tor years
fought the spirit of murder, and
blood sheed under the pretense
of war, and intervention.
And from good authority
more than one half of Mexico's
national wealth belongs to A-
merican capitalism, For we are
lead to believe that Rockfellow
controles the Mexican oil fields,
Guggenheim the Mexican Cop
per Mines, and Hearst the are
able lands, oi i'exico' inis we
most believe is the sole cause for
all the up roar among the Rich
lords of America for war with
Mexico.

SOLDIERS NEARLY STARVING.
We understand the hrst Pen'.
nsylvania's fell into all the woes '
that can befall a soldier were
theirs, from the moment they
entered mobilization camp until
cow-and they were slowly starv
ing to death. Hungry eyes roll
ed, unwashed hands beat a
constant tattoo in aluminum
mess kits. Some of the men in
an excess of anger even hurled
stale hard tack at equally glum
and spirit broken officers, who
had abstained from eating
because they had nothing to live
on but regrets.
Ever since they left Philadel
phia the dinky, obsolete cars
bounced on the rails as if they
bad no springs. The seats were
narrow and made to face each
other and the soldiers were forc
ed lo ride three in each with the
equipment piled between. At
night they bunked on the floor
They got no exercise and no
bath. They had left Mount
Gretna earlier than the officers
exptctod and so had timu only to
takfc on rations for one and t
half days . It wa hard tack sop
and canned beans.
The sop was made by dipping
a hard tack, which is a "Harvey
zed" and unleavened soda crack
ers, half an inch wide in water.
The allowance of beans was
six 10 cent cans for each com
pany of seventy seven men.
