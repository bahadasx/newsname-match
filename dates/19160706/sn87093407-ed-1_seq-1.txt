"Our most valuable weapon for enforcing the dry la* hat

"I'm no lawyer, but I do not see anything in the decision to

"The people should clean out the supreme court. The dry

OLYMPIA, July 6—Sheriff Bob Hodge must return
the liquor he seized last January from the home of W. E. Boe
ing, at The Highland*, and from the private room of John
C. Eden at the Rainier Club, according to a decision "handed
down by the supreme court.
Judge Fullerton, the only dissenting member of the
supreme court, declared that the action of his associates "ren
ders inoperative the so-called permit section of the statute,
which limits the quantity of liquor or beer that a person may
ship into the state at one time."
The decision was written by Judge Mount and concurred
in by Ju<lgc» Morri", Bau«man. Kllis, C'hadwick, Main, \
comb and Parker. It reverse* Superior Judge Ronald.
The section of the dry law regulating the amount a per
son might have on hand after the adoption of the law. it was
held,.applied only to persons who had it for sale or bater.
Neither Hoeing nor I den had liquor for such pur
ine. it was found, and their entire stock must be turned back
to them by the sheriii. who says it lia- been kept intact.
"If the act Intended to make It a

has lawfully acquired." the opinion
read*, "that Idea ought lo have
been, and no doubt would have
been, expressed In plain words in
the statute."
Justice Kullerton. In hi* dissent-'
Ine opinion, said
"The art la written In plain, un

"The majority decision is going

the law all but impossible, and
more than this. It renders inoperst j

the statute, the section which lim
its the quantity of liquor or beer an
