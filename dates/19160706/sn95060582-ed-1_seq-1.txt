BIG CELEBRATION.
The Fourth of July was cele
brated in grand style in St Johns
this year.
As the sun rose over the east
ern hoi'izon the peaceful slumbers
of the inhabitants of St. Johns
were disturbed by the terrible
cannonadivg that thundered over
the valley. At nine o'clock a
parade was formed headed by the
St. Johns Band and the main
streets of the city were paraded.
At ten o'clock a beautiful pro
gram was rendered at the aca-
, demy and greatly appreciated by
, the large audience present. Every
number was rendered in an excel
lent manner and the spirit of true
patriotism prevailed.
The afternoon was given over
to sports of various kinds, races,
boxing bouts, wrestling, etc. In
the evening a big dance at the
Overson Hall was the closing
event of one of the most success
ful fourth of July celebrations
that has ever been pulled off in
Apache county.
Constipation and indigestion.
"I have used Chamberlain's
Tablets and must say they are the
best I have ever used for consti
pation and indigestion. My wife
also used them for indigestion and
they did her good," writes Eu
gene S. Knight, Wilmington, N.
C. Chamberlain's Tablets are
mild and gentle in their action.
Give them a trial. You are cer
tain to be pleased with the agree
able laxative effect which they
produce. Obtainable everywhere.

portant subject.
Mr. Orville Martin of Adamana
was in the city this week. He
was returning from Springerville
where he attended the Fourth of
July celebration.
Mr. Geo. A. Olney, candidate
for governor of Arizona together
with W. W. Pace and W. T.
Webb were in the city this week
holding meetings and talking
with the people of St. Johns and
Apache county. The meetings
were largely attended and no
doubt the many good things said
had their weight with the people
of our town, for we find that
there are quite a number that
think that perhaps Mr. Olney is
the proper man for the place.
The gentlemen who are with Mr.
Olney are very enthuiastic in the
work of trying to get Mr. Olney
nominated for Arizona's next
governor and in our opinion they
are in a fair way to make good at
their work. Mr. Olney stands for
equal taxation, economy in all
public institutions, the Extension
of public roads, the enacting of
laws for the pretection of the
Live Stock Industry, a good effi
cient National Guard, and that
the lands not actually needed by
the Indians be opened for entry,
also in favor of the laboring man
realizing to the fullest extent the
rewards of his labor.
The following is a list of the
names of those who donated to
wards the celebration of San Juan
Day and the amount subscrib
ed by each, and also an account
of how the money way spent:
Taking Big Chances.
It is a great risk to travel with
out a bottle of Chamberlain's
Colic, Cholera and Diarrhoea
Remedy, as this preparation can
not be obtained on the trains or
steamships. Attacks of bowel
complaints are often sudden ane1
very severe, and everyone should
go prepared for them. Obtaina
able everywhere. Adv.
Father Derichemont spent the
first part of the week at Springerville.

Every family without exception
