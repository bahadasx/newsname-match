MIRE WRITES AGAIN
Another Newsy and Interesting Letter
From Camp Bobleter, Ft. Snelling
Many Sunday Visitors.
Each Member of Company Takes the
Federal OathThird Regiment Or-
dered to Move Saturday.
The Union has a wide-awake corres
pondent with Co. and he will keep
our readers informed of the doings of
the Rum river valley company. Since
the following interesting letter was
written, orders have been received to
the effect that the Third reigment must
prepare to mo\e next Saturday morn
ing.
Camp Bobleter. Fort Snelling, July
3_( Special)Yesterday being Sunday
was a big day in camp for the Co.
boys. About fort} people, most of
whom were from Princeton, visited
the camp and took dinner with the
boys The\ were supplied with the
regular army utensils and took their
places in the line to the cook shanty,
where they got their regular army
rations and ate them at the company
table After dinner each visitor
washed up his own dishes and helped
put the camp in ship shape so the
medical inspector, who makes a daily
tour of each street, had no fault to
find with the Princeton company. Fol
lowing is the menu of the Sunday din
ner as served by Cook Jones and his
staff: Chicken, mashed potatoes with
chicken gravy, bread and butter, coffee
or milk, dill pickles, ice cream, ba
nanas, assorted cookies.
However, gentle reader, don't get
the erroneous idea that this is what
we get to eat every day, for it is not.
This Sunday dinner was in the nature
of a spread for the visitors from
home, and the extras were bought and
paid for out of the company fund or
were contributed by generous spirited
citizens of Princeton.
Practically each member of the
company has now completed the red
tape process that either leaves him
a member of the federalized militia
of the United States or disqualifies
him for service. On the morning of
June 30th each and every member of
company took his place in line and
with head uncovered and right hand
raised took the federal oath. The
night before the oath was administered
there was considerable argument in
camp about whether the boys would
take the oath or not. However, as
most of the difference of opinion arose
through a misunderstanding as to
what the new oath covered, the situa
tion rapidly cleared when the terms
of the new contract were understood
by the men. About the only real
diffeience between the new contract
and the original one, is that the fed
eralized militia can be used across
the border whereas the national
guard men could not be taken any
farther than the boundary lines of the
United State The original term of
enlistment 1^ not extended under the
new o^th
On the following day the boys got
their medical and physical examina
tion, ?nd it is a thorough and complete
going o\er of each man by trained
medical experts. Report has not been
returned the official "fighting face"
of eompanv is yet not ready for
publication. Unofficially it is learned
that about ten or twelve of the com
pany will be disqualified and the offi
cial report will in all probability in
clude several others. Most of the com
panies in the 3rd regiment lost un
officially from ten to fifteen percent of
their fighting strength.
Sunday afternoon the boys were all
\accmated for small pox and now
they are all wondering how sore their
punctured arms are going to be with
in the three day period that the medi
cal sharps give the dope time to work
in.
The camp is continually full of
rumors as to when the 3rd regiment
will leave for the front, but the actual
facts are known only by a very few
of the "higher-ups," as it appears to
be the policy of the war department
to keep all troop movements secret.
However, there is no doubt but what
the 3rd will be the first of the Minne
sota infantry that will be taken to the
border. This will be for the reason
that today, taking all things into
consideration, the 3rd is the best fight
ing unit of infantry that Minnesota
can produce.

German School Efficiency.
While the German government is
looking after the workingmen of the
present it is equally zealous for the
workingmen of the future. Though
Germany spends on elementary schools
little more than half as much per capi
ta of population as we do, Germany
unquestionably gets more out of her
school system than we. There are
districts in the United States where
the children get only 12 weeks of
school a year, a practice that any
German rural school authorities would
consider barbarous.
Nowhere in the United States is
there a longer school term than in
New York City, where the children
get 950 hours of school a year.
Throughout the rural districts of Ger
many the children get as much more.
The children in Berlin get about 50
per cent more school training a
year than the children in New York.
In fact, our large cities have shorter
school days, a shorter school month
and a shorter school year than any
cities of the first-class in Germany,
France or Great Britian.
Moreover, the child in the German
cities gets benefits from the public
school which our city authorities con
sider beyond their province. The Ger
man school children are taken on long
tramps and camping excursions
through the country. The schools give
them medical attendance and advise
the parents on diet. Poor children re
ceive a hot breakfast in school, and
holiday camps are provided for those
who are run down.Harold Kellock,

Care May Prevent Overheating Horse.
Horsemen will soon need to be on
their guard against overheating. Most
cases of overheating can be prevented
by keeping a few simple things in
mind.
Give at least a pailful of water to
each horse about 10 o'clock and again
at 3 or 4 o'clock on a hot day.
Be very careful with a horse that is
a little out of health, if you are work
ing him on a hot day.
Look out for a horse that after
sweating freely suddenly stops sweat
ing. Put such a horse in the shade
as soon as possible and give a moder
ate drink.
Do not put a horse not in good con
dition for hard work in the center of
a four-horse team in hot weather.
Work carefully on a hot day when
the atmosphere is moist and heavy.
A horse can hardly get too hot to
water, but one must regulate the
amount by the temperature of the
water.
In case of an attack of overheating,
the horse should be taken to the shade
as soon as possible. A treatment of
the service of the body, particularly of
the head, with cold water should be
given until the temperature is within
a degree or two of normal. Stimu
lants such as whiskey or brandy, well
diluted, should be given as early as
possible.
In most cases it is better to plan to
avoid overheating than to plan to treat
the horse for it.M. H. Reynolds,

Mothers of Brave Men.
A. A. Caswell, of Anoka, who was
formerly half owner of the Anoka
Herald, partnership with'his broth
er, I. A. Caswell, clerk of the supreme
court, has given a remarkable evi
dence of loyalty to the state and gov
ernment. He was captain of the Ano
ka company, and he has three sons
members of this company. He is au
ditor of Anoka county, but when the
call came he promptly assembled his
company, and he and his three sons
are ready to march to the front. In
this connection it is announced that
he has been promoted to the position
of major. Major Caswell has a good
sound, and it fits a very deserving
man. But all the praise does not be
long to him. Mrs. Caswell, who is a
most worthy woman, and a devoted
mother, is making more real sacrifice
for the country when she gives her
husband and her three brave sons.
And there is another Anoka woman
who wins the admiration of many
friends, Mrs. Mary Cutter, who sees
her only son go to the front with her

Sister Fuller No Mollycoddle.
If there is one thing that rouses out
revolutionary blood almost to the
bursting point, it is to hear a male
orator liken our sect to a dewdrop or
a pearl. A dewdrop is at best but a
transient thing. It yields to the heat
of the sun and dissipates itself into
the vapory ether. A pearl is a cold,
hard, unmouldable thing. We claim,
as a woman, that we're like neither
of the twaina dewdrop or pearl. The
day when women sit like a bowl of
mush and absorb such twaddle is hap
pily about over with. A few there be,
no doubt, who yet like the taste of such
stuff. But we hereby warn the male
sex that hand out oratorically such
dope that they had better get it all out
of their system right speedily as wo
men are turning awray
nauseated by
the gush. Women know what they are.
They can't be told by any manfor
he doesn't know. At his best and full
est knowledge of her, woman to him
but a contradiction is.
The dewdrop game, the pearl sym
bolization, the breath-of-a-hly and the
fiush-of-a-rose idealization, etc., as ap
plied to women is a dead and gone is

remembered, perhaps, but never drag

Ministers' Sons.
M. S. Norehus, the accomplished ed
itor of the Chisago County Press, him
self the son of an eminent Swedish di
vine, comments thusly on "Ministers'
Sons:"
"It is a noteworthy fact that both
Woodrow Wilson, president of the
United States, and Charles Evans
Hughes are ministers' sons. And so
is Thomas Alvah Edison, the world's
greatest inventor. Those who have
maintained that the poor minister's
son can come to no good in this world
should take hope. Some of them are
very much in the limelight and those
of them who are still enshrouded in
more or less oblivion, can at least take
comfort in announcing the the world
that after all there is really presiden
tial timber among them. Chester A.
Arthur and Grover Cleveland were also
poor ministers' sons and so was Glad
stone, England's greatest premier. No
matter what happens this fall, we are
still bound to have a minister's son
for president of the United States dur
ing the next four years and we will
wager a ten dollar hat that either of
'em will make good. We have arrived
at this conclusion from geneological
and natural reasons."
Republican State Committee.
Last Thursday the candidates of the
se\ eral political parties met at the
capitol and selected committees. The
republican candidates got together be
fore the meeting and jointly agreed on
the membership of the committee,
which will be composed of 21 members
seven of whom will constitute the exe
cutive committee. It is understood
that each candidate on the state ticket
and each of the congressional candi
dates named a member of the commit
tee, and then four at large were added.
Eric L. Thornton of Benson is chair
man, Josiah H. Chase of Minneapolis,
secretary, and Fred B. Snyder of Min
neapolis is treasurer. Frank B. Kel
logg's personal representative on the
committee is Charles J. Moos of St.
Paul, while Governor Burnquist's per
sonal representative is Gust Lindquist
of St. Paul.
Mrs. Briggs Postmaster.
Mrs. M. M. Briggs has been ap
pointed postmaster at this place. Since
the death of her husband Mrs. Briggs
has been acting postmaster to the en
tire satisfaction of all who have had
business with the office. Mrs. Briggs
is efficient and accommodating and
the office was never better conducted
than under her management. Some
time ago a petition was circulated in
her behalf and the same was signed
by almost everyone to whom it was
presented. The appointment of Mrs.
Briggs gives general satisfaction.
Graduated and Located.
Gordon S. Keith, nephew of Judge
Chas. Keith, of this place, graduated
from the St. Paul law school recently,
and on Monday Judge Keith received
word that Gordon had successfully
passed the North Dakota examining
board and was admitted to practice
in all the courts of that state
Mr. Keith will locate in Edgeley, a
thriving North Dakota town, and
practice his profession there. He 4s
a promising young man and has a
bright future ahead of him.
Gone Over from Elk River to Brainerd
Last Saturday by General Manager
Clarkson anC Others.
Roads in Good Condition and Great In-
terest Was Manifested by People
Along the Route.
Word was received in Princeton last
Friday that the members of the Jeffer
son Highway inspection committee
would arrive at Elk River from the
north late that evening, and would
leave there early Saturday morning to
go over the eastern route between Elk
River and Brainerd, via Princeton.
Milaca and Mille Lacs lake.
By 4:45 a. m., Saturday, a delegation
from Princeton reached Elk River, but
the inspecting party had been delayed
by the hospitable boosters of St. Cloud
and did not arrive until after eight
o'clock.
The party consisted of Mr. J. D.
Clarkson of Carthage, Mo., general
manager of the Jefferson Highway,
Henry H. Orme of St. Paul, president
of the State Automobile association
and one of the Minnesota directors of
the Jefferson Highway, John H. Mul
len, deputy state highway engineer,
Senator P. H. McGarry of Walker,
representing the eastern route, J. K.
WTest
of Detroit representing the west-
ern route, Daniel Shaw of Thief River
Falls, representing the central route,
Hon. L. H. Rice of Park Rapids, and
Rudolph Lee of Long Prairie, repre
senting the central route north from
Sauk Centre.
The party started from Elk River
about 8:20 and made Princeton in 40
minutes. Here quite a stop was made.
At Milaca there was the usual Satur
day crowd of farmers in town. Here
Mr. Clarkson made a rattling good
short speech from the steps of the
Arlington hotel, which was well re
ceived and enthusiastically applauded.
Among other things Mr. Clarkson
said Minnesota had a most excellent
road law, and that in the past five
days he had traveled over 1,100 miles
of good and fairly good roads that had
been constructed under the provisions
of" that law.
Senator P. H. McGarry also spoke
briefly and his witty remarks elicited
rounds of applause.
A cordial welcome was accorded the
party at Onamia. Wahkon people
were also much in evidence here. Again
Mr. Clarkson and Senator McGarry
delivered brief but highly appropri
ate remarks which brought forth re
sponsive cheers from the crowd.
From Onamia the route was direct
ly north to the Queen of Minnesota
lakesbeautiful, incomparable, Mille
Lacs. The road around the south
short of the lake is not a state high
way, but it will be so designated in
the near future. It was too bad that
a fog partially obscured the view of
the visitors, and it was also regrettable
that time did not permit of the party
visiting Cove and Wahkon, really the
most picturesque sections of the lake
shore, and where almost all of the good
harbors as well as most of the cottages
are located.
It was high noon when the party
reached Garrison on the west shore,
where many of Brainerd's foremost
citizens were waiting to escort the of
ficial members of the party to that
city. As the visitors passed through
double and treble lines of automobiles
the cheering and horn-tooting was
deafening. Here the Union scribe left
the party, but we know the good peo
ple of Brainerd treated the visitors
right royally.
The distance over the route traveled
from Elk River to Garrison is about
80 miles, and, allowing for stops, was
covered in less than three hours, which
would indicate that the roads were in
fairly good condition, considering the
recent heavy downpours. On many
stretches of the road 35 and 40 miles
per hour was made. Then in some
places it was necessary to slow down
to 10 or 15 miles.
Mr. Clarkson was a close observer
of every foot of the route traversed
and constantly consulted his map and
propounded numerous -inquiries to
Deputy State Engineer Mullen. There
was not a thing that escaped Mr.
Clarkson's attention.
In the opinion of the writer Mr.
Clarkson is not a man who can be eas
ily influenced, nor do we imagine it
would be pleasant for the person that
would have the temerity to attempt
it. We have not the slightest idea of
which route will be finally .determined
upon, but whatever decision Mr.
Clarkson arrives at ought to be cheer
fully acquiesced in by all.
It should be borne in mind by the
^-^^r
strangers who went over the route
from Elk River to Garrison that at
least ten miles of the road traversed
will not be a part of the Jefferson
Highway should the eastern route be
designated. Immediately south of
Princeton, on state road No. 1, Sher
burne county, the road around a marsh
where a sink-hole is being filled,
has not been worked for two years
and will be discontinued when the fill
is completed and the road straightened
out. There is also a four mile stretch
in the town of Page, about ten miles
north of Milaca that will be discon
tinued as a state road when the cut-off
is completed this fall. The approach
to Mille Lacs lake, going north from
Onamia, will also be straightened out
without delay at present the road
crosses diagonally over lots. This road
will follow the lake shore about three
miles, almost directly east from where
the Jefferson Highway party first
reached the shore of the lake.
NOTES.
The finest stretch of road on the
entire route was in Princeton town
ship from the village limits to the Bo
gus Brook line. Our hat is doffed to
Commisssioner Cater.
Well, we may not get the Jefferson
Highway located on the eastern route,
but a lively interest has been stirred
up in behalf of better roads and much
good will result therefrom.
Bogus Brook town was hit hard by
the recent deluge but when the waters
subsided Supervisor Wm. Talen and
his assistants did some excellent repair
work. Mr. Talen is certainly deserv
ing of great praise.
No really poor stretch of road was
encountered Mille Lacs county. Of
course there were a few soft spots
where the high water in the river had
backed up several brooks and caused
them to overflow their banks. But on
the whole the roads were good.
H. F. Mann, Commissioner James
Warren, Fred Burrell, Jesse Rogers
and other hustlers in the lake region
are deserving of especial mention for
the great interest they have taken in
this Jefferson highway project. Messrs.
Mann and Warren have been especial
ly active and attended several meet
ings in Brainerd and St. Paul.
Mr. Clarkson and Mr. Orme were
surprised at the beautiful new $100,-
uCO school building that is be^ng com
pleted at Milaca. They said the build
jng would be a credit to any "ity fifty
times as large as Milaca. They -vers
rlso surprised to learn that Mi'a^i was
the second largest creamery town in
ihe state and would soon be the first.
Mr. E. L. McMillan and Mr. J. F.
Petterson placed their finely equipped
Cadillac cars at the disposal of the
committee. Mac handled his own car
and had Mr. Clarkson for a seatmate.
Gerald Petfcerson guided the other
car. It is needless to add that the
grass was not permitted to grow un
der the wheels of either of the ve
hicles.
It was thought that two automobiles
would care for the visitors. But it was
discovered at Elk River that three ma
chines would be necessary. Charles
M. Babcock, like the gentleman he is,
came to the rescue with his machine
and conveyed three of the party to
Princeton Mr. Manly Clark of MHaca
kindly gave the use of his car from
here to Garrison.
All through Mille Lacs county the
party was most cordially greeted.
Many of the farm houses along the
route were decorated with flowers,
flags and bunting. At Onamia a beau
tiful arch was erected over the south
ern end of the bridge spanning the
Rum river. Flags were flying every
where in Onamia and the people were
extremely cordial in their greetings.

The Fourth at Glendorado.
Over 2,000 people attended the In
dependence day observance at Glendo
rado under the auspices of the wide
awake Farmers" club of that place and
the band. Princeton was well repre
sented, as was the entire surrounding
country.
A splendid program had been ar
ranged for the occasion, and it was
carried out without a hitch. The Glen
dorado brass band discoursed stirring
music throughout the day, and it is a
musical organization that the thriv
ing Benton county community can feel
proud of.
The industrial parade in the morn
ing was a fine showing and excited
much favorable comment.
The program at the band stand com
menced at 2 o'clock, and Hon. Ed. In
drehus presided. After a band selec
tion Mr. Indrehus with brief but ap
propriate remarks introduced Senator
John D. Sullivan of St. Cloud, the
speaker of the day.
Senator Sullivan is able, eloquent
and forceful, and he delivered a mas
terly argument in favor of prepared
ness. He urged his hearers to vote
for those congressional candidates who
are pledged to favor adequate defense
measures. Congress with its unceas
ing talk and no action, although the
mightiest struggle in the history of
the world is on, reminded the speaker
of Nero fiddling while Rome burned.
It was a powerful argument delivered
sincerely and it is safe to say that few
if any of Senator Sullivan's hearers
are opposed to preparedness.
Songs by a well-trained chorus were
well received, and the star drill by a
number of small girls was greeeted
with applause.
The ball game between Greenbush
and Ronneby proved most interesting.
Ronneby put in an appearance with
several hired players from Foley, but
the Greenbush lads were undaunted,
and carried off the honors by a count
of 8 to 4. A goodly contingent of
Princeton fans were inattendance and
they cheered the Mille Lacs county
boys lustily and long.
A tug of war between a team made
up of Greenbush men, and one com
posed of Glendorado and Santiago
heavyweights resulted in a victory for
first* named.
Mille Lacs county also carried off
the honors in the horse race. Several
running steeds were entered, but Nels
Robideau's bay galloped under the wire
first in two straight heats.
All in all it was a fine observance,
and those in attendance enjoyed every
mhrate of the day.
