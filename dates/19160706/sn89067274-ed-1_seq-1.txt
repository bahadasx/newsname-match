CIRCUIT COURT SITS
- I'l SESSION JULY 4
Court is Held on This Holiday
for First Time in Over
Thirty Years.
DOCKET IS VERY LONG
Judge Gantt Cannot Sit in Many
Cases Judge Davis, of
Marshall, is Here.
Earl Moore's taxi which was
driven by Mason Tinaley, was
strucK Dy wabash pasenger
train No. 13, at 11 :15 Sunday
morning at the high crossing on
Walnut street, when the automo
bile was crossing the track. Mr.
and Mrs. J. B. Fefiil, of St. Louis
were in the car at the time. All
escaped without injury.
Mr. Tinaley says the approach
ing train was hidden from him
by trees and his attention was
also diverted by a freight train
near the crossing. His brother,
who was on the front seat with
him, called .his attention to tho
upiuuuuuug uruiu, out ne mis
understood and looked in the op
posite direction. When he did
catch sgiht of the train, he just
had time to leap to the ground.
The top of the machine was
up and Mr. and Mrs. Feffill, who
saw the train first, had some
trouble in escaping from the car,
though they did in time to be
clear of it when it struck .
The machine was a total
wreck and the escape of those in
it is considered really miracu
lous. This is a very dangerous
crossipg and the accident again
argues for fewer grade crossings
here.
For the first time in thirty
years the Audrain Circuit Court
sat in session July 4th. The
docket for this term is one of the
longest in years and as Judge
Gantt cannot hear many of them
much time is lost in getting
Judges to hear the cases. Judge
J. F. Davis, of Marshall, is sit
ting in court this week. The
case before the -jury Tuesday
was the case of E. W. Cunning
ham against the Chicago &
Alton . for damages to' the
amount of $1,625, caused by loss
es in a shipment of cattle.
The cases of Joel Headington
against Susan Woodward forsuit
in partition and to cancel deeds
were continued. .
W. H. Smith, naturalization
examiner, was here Wednesday,
checking up on the cases of
Fred Hassen and Martin Tin
dorf, shoe maker at Steinman's
Shoe Store, who will take out
naturalization papers in the Sep
tember term of Court.
The cases of the Ford Mfg.
Co. against the Insurance Co. of
North America, Royal Insurance
Co. and the Citizens Co., will go

With favorable weather, prac
tically all crops made marked
improvement during the latter
part of June, according to the
monthly crop report issued to
day from the Board of Agricul
ture. The report follows:
No devastating drouth has
demanded its discontent. The
"Big Muddy"; tj and smaller
streams have kept within their
banks. There is no complaint
of cinch bugs or other insect
pests of field crops.
For the State as a whole, cor
respondents report corn condi
tion at 79.4, as comparedwith 76
one year ago, and with a 10-year-average
of 80.9. By sections
conditions show: Northeast,
78; northwest, 74;central, 81;
southwest, 82;southeast, 82;
Present estimates as to acreage
shows a loss of 2.8 per cent, as
compared with 7,218,500
acres last year. The principal
decrease is in the northeast sec
tion, the next heaviest in the
southeast.
Wheat Harvest conditions
are all that could be desired and
the wheat crop is going into the
shock in good shape . The yield,
though, will be the lowest for
many years, final hgures on
condition of part not harvested
show that 57.8, or practically
the same as one month ago, when
the report showed 57.2.
Presenting harvesting by sec
tions shows: Northeast, 17 per
Northwest, 4;? Central, 43;
Southwest, 43; Southeast, 65,
Threshing is just starting in
the most southern counties, so
that it is too early to forecast
the yield with any degree of
certainty. A preliminary esti
mate by correspondents gives
the State yield as 9.9 bushels or
by sections, as follows; North
east, 9.5; Northwest, 15.3; Cen
tral, 8.5 j-Southwest, 8.1; South
east, 8.3. The yield will vary
greatly from 3 to 80 bushels
and in a few instances practical
ly nothing. , .
Oats The oats crop is hne.
Condition for the State is 88, as
compared with a five-year aver
age of 76. By . sections condi
tion figures show: Northeast,
86; northwest, 94; Central, 92;
Southwest, 88; Southeast, 80.
Taking the State as a whole,
only about 10 per cent of the
oats crop has been harvested,
but south of the Misouri River
one-fourth of the crop is in the
shock. A preliminary estimate
as to yield per acre places it at
30 bushels per acre. If this esti
mate is later realized it will rep
resent a State yield of more than
30,000,000 bushels. "
Other Crops An abundance
crop of hay is being saved in
good shape. Condition of timo
thy is 90.4. Clover condition is
91.6 with yield per acre of 1st
cuting estimated at 1.6 tons and
acreage of 97 per cent, as com
pared with last year's report.

CROPS ARE IMPROVING.
COLUMBIA, Mo., July 3.
With favorable weather, practi
cally all crops made marked im
provement the latter part of
June, according to the monthly
crop report issued to day by the
Missouri State Board of Agri
culture. The report follows:
"The end of the month of
June found everybody busy and
everybody hopeful on Missouri
farms, where there's no talk of
turning the clocks up in order to
get another hour of daylight.
Right now, with late corn plant
ing scarcely completed, with
early com to "lay by," and with
wheat, oats and hay harvests
all on hand, the length of the
farmer's day is limited only by
human indurance. Yet there is
heard no complaint.
"This Missouri farmer i3 hapn
py as he hustles. No devastat
ing drought has demanded its
discount. The "Big Muddy" and
smaller streams have kept with
in their banks. There is no com
pfaint of chinch bugs, the army
worm or other insect pests of
field crops." '
