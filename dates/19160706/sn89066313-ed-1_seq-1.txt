chasm between the wealth accumula
tors and the other class means the
destruction of democracy. The rich
must spend with as little harm to
those who arc not rich as is possi

wealth imposes certain problems upon
society, and a new class has grown
up, known as the 'Spenders,' whose
duty it is to consume the surplus of
riches.
"Every primitive society is industri

shelter are the problems of the prlm

development of agriculture, the labor

man and woman worked side by side
through the domestic and handicraft

The speakers of the luncheon this

of the coming chautauqua to the busi
ness men of the town.
Gives Chautauqua a Boost.
"The chautauqua is one of the great
est institutions that we have. It
reaches more people during the sum
mer than any other educational In
stitution. Usually, one number of a
chautauqua program is worth the
price of the entire season ticket," said
Mr Conley.
"The chautauqua," said Mr. Schwabe
"helps the merchants of the town. It
is educational, and what helps one
person in a community is benefit ial to
all."
The Commercial Club by a standing
vote passed a resolution which com-
, mended E. B Cauthorn for the good
It will go forward soon.
It was also learned today that ne
gotiations with the Carranzista gov
ernment will be taken up through the
customary diplomatic channels.
It is probable Secretary Lansing
vill begin work at once on the reply
to Cairanza to be ready to present it
o jthe cabinet tomorrow before he
leaves on a month's vacation.
What the reply will embody was
gone over thoroughly by the President
and Mr. Lansing in their 45-mInute
talk. No inkling of its contents could
he learned, however.
Foreign .Minister Aguilar of Mexi
co today issued a statement to the
Mexican people that the government
expects a completely satisfactory so
lution, of all the questions and issues
between Mexico and the United States
without injury to the prime Interests
of the Mexican people.
This Information was cabled to the
Mexican embassy here.
President Wilson, however, Is not
convinced all the danger in Mexico is
ovci. Carranza's attitude, now one
ui c. operation and friendliness, gives
satisfaction to the officials, but the
border danger still lives.
These three problems are jet to be
solved:
1. Withdrawal of the punitive expe
dition; 2. Co-operative control of the bor
der; 3. Cleaning up of Mexico and re
establishing peace and order.
There arc few officials here who do
not believe that three months will see
'he American forces cntirelj' out of
he southern republic, most of the mi
litia, if not all, back at home, and
the border in the protection
itrong foice of regulars.
This movement will be hastened by
efforts of determination shown by
Carranzista troops to clean up north
ern Mexico.

PARIS. Julj C A strong .German
counter attack north of the Somme
last night and this morning resulted
in the recapture from the French of
two small woods on the front two
thirds of a mile north of the village
of Hem, it was officially admitted this
afternoon. The French retaliated by
gaining a wood northeast of the same
village and driving the Kaiser's forc
es from the outskirts of the town.
The lull in the fighting south of the
Somme last night probably was due
to the necessity of artillery co-operation
before the French renewed their
advance.
The French have taken the German
second-line position on a wide front,
but now face new and strong offen
sive positions before Peronne. With
French troops almost in the outskirts
of the town, the Germans reinforced
heavily and held their ground.
The Verdun cathedral was heavily
bombarded by the Germans last night
with large shells. The Germans did
not resume their artillery attacks.
Artillery duels continued this evening.

British commander-in-chief, this ev

South of La Bassee the British

The Kaiser is reported to have ar

great Allied offensive.
Great bodies of German troops are
being massed bctwen the Ancre and
the Somme to stem the British ad
vance. Holland dispatches tonight
confirm reports of heavy concentra
tion between Ypres and the Somme.
There is every indication the Teu
tonic legions will launch a heavy
counter attack along the British line
within the next seventy hours.
The object will not only be to stave
off the British but to prevent a furth
er advance by the French, who can
not continue their advance if the Brit
