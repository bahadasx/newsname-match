Commercial Association.
Personal Liberty League.
United Societies for Local Self GovernmeHt. '

What do you think of u business that will not defend itself under
its own name?
Jackson, Neb., was in with a load of
mixed yearlings that had been on
feed long enough to bring $9.85.
The shipment consisted of twenty-
hve head that weighu close to out
pounds each. Mr. Larsen said that
he picked the cattle up in the coun
try last fall, and after roughing
them, put them on a ration of corn
and alfalfa. A fair gain in weight
was made, he said, but the last
bunch made a much greater increase.
In commenting on the pig crop Mr.
Larsen stated that it was hardly up
to normal, while the grain outlook
was favorable.... The highest Iowa
court yesterday, in a batch of de
cisions enumerated briefly, revers
ed the judgment of John W. Ander
son in the case of John F. Davey, a
Sioux City druggist, who was order
ed confined in the state penitentiary
because of violations of a liquor in
junction. Davey had appealed on
two grounds. One was based on the
alleged insufficiency of evidence to
convict. In the opinion of County
Attorney G. T. Naglestad, it is hard
ly believable that the supreme court
could have sustained that contention.
Davey's other contention was that
.by being senteice'd to prison with
out a jury trial he was deprived of one
of his constitntional guarantees. In
all likelyhood it was on that ground
that the upper court ruled his sen
tence illegal, said Mr. Naglestad last
night. If that assumption is correct,
it means that the whole Iowa law pro
viding for such sentences is dead.
John F. Joseph, attorney for the
Woodbury County Antisaloon league,
said that until the text of the su
preme court's decision is available it
will be impossible to say positively
whether the new 'aw has peen in
validated. Davey operated a drug
store at 1014 Fourth street. He wap
enjoined from selling liquor, and
was cited for contempt for ignoring
that injunction. The prison sen
tence then was imposed. He was
ordered imprisoned for a term of
one year. Under no other statute
is it possible to inflict a prison sen
tence without jury trial.
Sioux City Journal, 3rd: One
hundred and fourteen men of the
secret service of the Great Northern
railroau, which included every man
in that department over the entire
Bystem, with the exception' of Dave
Barrett and Fred Schmidt, special
agents in Sioux City, resigned their
positions late Saturday, according to
word received from St. Paul. The
Pinkerton Detective agency has
been placed in charge of the work qf
the whole Great Northern system.
The walkout of the detectives fol
lowed the resignation of A. G. Ray,
chief special agent for the system.
Mr. Barrett said last night that he
and Schmidt, the remainder of the
old force, do not intend to leave the
service of the road. It is reported
that Mr. Ray resigned in order that
he might accept an executive posi
tion with a labor bureau in Pitts
burgh and that his men are go
ing with him to quell labor distur
bances now being eperienced in Pitts
burgh .... Fifty-five Sioux City boy
scouts will leave the Y. M. C. A.
about 7:30 o'clock this morning for
their camp at Crystal lake. It is
planned that as many as possible will
take the 7:30 o'clock South Sioux
City car and that the remainder will
go at a o'clock. Because of the in
tense heat of the last few days the
plan of hiking to the campsite from
the end of the South Sioux car line
has been abandoned, and automo
biles will be used to transport the
scouts. The distance is four miles,
and it was considered better not to
make the boys walk too far in the
hot sun on the first day. Everything
is in readiness for the camp. It is
located in the timberland at the
northwest end of Walker's island.
Friday and Saturday E. C. Wolcott,
scout commissioner; Joe Dean, Rob
ert Ross and Harry Ghormley, scout
masters, were busy at the camp put
ting up tents and digging the well.
In order to get water without any
trace of iron, it was necessary to
drill eighteen feet.
The water is
is as good as any
the tents for the
Jied. A cooks'
tent also have
clear and cold, and
on the lake. All of
boys have been pit
shanty and a mess
been erected. Provisions have been
sent to the grounds and are in readi
ness for the first meal at noon today.
The boys from outside towns who
are registered for the camp will ar
rive in automobiles after dinner.
There will be troops from Winneba
go, ,Whiting, Wayne and Bronson.
Registrations continued to come in
yesterday, and it is poseible that
more than 100 boys will be in camp.
Sioux City Journal, 4th: The Lib
eral Labor league, of South Sioux
City, will hold its first annual picnic
at Crystal lake Sunday Miss
Louise M. Pack, daughter of Mr,
and Mrs R. E- Pack, 822 Dubuque
street, eloped to Dakota City on
June 21 with Helmer E. Hemnes and
was married. Announcement of the
marriage was made yesterday by the
parents of Mrs. Hemnes. Mr. and
MrSi Hemnes departed yesterday for
a two weeks' launqh trip on the Big
Si&ux river " . . . Camp Learner, the
boy scout camp on Crystal lake,
was opened yesterday when ninety
six boys from Iowa and Nebraska
assembled for a week's outing. The
sqputs began ariving at the grounds
at 9:30 o'clock. By 10:30 o'clock all
of the Sioux City boys, fifty-six in
number, were at the camp. Their
blanket rolls and other luggage had
been taken to the site on Saturday.
During the remainder of the morn
ing the officers in charge of the camp
were busy assigning the boys to
their tents. Instead of each patrol
being placed in a tent by itself, the
boys have been scattered so that
there will be an opportunity for all
to become acquainted. In the after
noon the patrols from Wayne and
Whiting arrived at the camp. Thirty
boys were in the delegation from
Wayne, and ten from Whiting. W.
L. Ellis is in charge of the Wayne
bovs. and C. E. Robinson of the
Whiting delegation. Eight boys
will arrive from Winnebago, Neb.,
bringing the total above 100. Only
Ereliminary work was given the
oys during the afternoon. They
were instructed how to prepare their
ticks and lay their ponchos. They
then were set to work gathering
wood for the camp fires. Last night
a boy was chosen from each tent to
assist in the publishing of the camp
paper. Leslie Brown, of Whiting,
was chosen editor in chief. The pa
peper will be made up every after
noon and read at the campfire in the
evening. Items concerning happen
ings in the camp and in tents will be
included in the paper. In order to
house the scouts who are attending
the camp it was necessary to obtain
two additional tents. Eleven men
are in the camp. They .are: Rev. J.
J. DePree, chaplain; H. L. Hough
ton. C. N. Waters. H. K. Ghormley,
Robert C. Ross, Joe Dean, Mr. Rob
inson, Mr. Ellis, Mr. Mines, Mr. Ber
ry and E. C. Wolcott, the scout com
missioner. Today the boys will bo
wakened at 6 o'clock. After setting
up exercises and a swim they will
have breakfast. During the morn
ing the regular program will be ad
hered to. Details will assist the
cook, others will look after the camp
cleanup and all tents will be made
ready for inspection. At noon a
chicken dinner will be served. Vis
itors will be admitted during the
afternoon and evening. Swimming
and games will take up the time.
A fireworkB display will be held this

Niobrara Tribune: Sarah Ann
Hull was born in Westmoreland
county, Pa on August 15, 1832.
On her father's side she was a de
scendant of Capt. John Hull, and on
her mother's side, of Jacob Byerly,
who patented the first land in Penn
sylvania, and whoso wife, a grand
mother of Mrs. Chambers, organized
the nrst bunuay school in the same
state. When Mrs. Chambers was a
young girl she attended the country
school and later on finished her edu
cation in Apolla, Pa. She was mar
ried to Benjamin F. Chambers on
March 3. 1857. To this union seven
children were born: Mary B., wife
of John W. Wood, of Los Angeles.
Calif.: Edwin Hull Chambers, of
Columbus, Neb.: William Lincoln.
who died in Dakota City in 1867;
George W., cashier of tho Niobrara
Valley bank, who died Ann 8. 1913:
Alice Bertina, tho wife of J. W.
Turner, of Springfield, S. D.; Harry
G who died in Niobrara in 1888,
having been nccidently shot through
the arm, and Sarah Minerva, tho
wife of W. C. Mason, of Chicago.
Immediately after their marriage
Mr. and Mrs. Chapbers came by
boat all tho way ffom Pittsburg,
Pa., to Dakota City, Neb., where
they made their home until 1879, lo
cating in a wild and unsettled coun
try wih but a dozen families living
in that section. Mr. Chambers built
the first house in what is now called
Dakota City, and the first lumber he
used on me from St. Louis, via the
Missouri river. Hi3 first house was
of h.j'c and poles, covered with
slough grass and earth. The jour
ney by boat from Pittsburg to Da
kota City took them three weeks,
and at the time they were leaving
the boat to start in housekeeping
Mr. Chambers paid $15 for two bush
els of potatoes. In 18G2 Mr. Chamb
ers enlisted as a member of Compa
ny I, "Second Nebraska Volunteer
Infantry, in the Indian warfare.
While serving as a soldier he left his
wife and daughter Elizabeth at
home. (Elizabeth was a daughter
of his first wife, who died in Grin
nell. la., in August, 1855.) One day
as the young wife and her step
daughter were at home by them
selves, they could see a band of In
dians coming toward their house,
and they came right into the yard
and began to sharpen their knives
on the sharpening stone close to the
house. Mrs. Chambers and Eliza
beth feared that theend was at hand,
but in the meantime a young Indian
appeared and approached the other
band and they all left without doing
any harm. Later on it was found
out that this young Indian had been
befriended by Mr. Chambers, and in
return" for his kindness, he Baved the
Chambers home. After spending
twenty-two years at Dakota City,
they moved to Niobrara in 1879.
During this year Geo. G. and Benj.
D. Bayha came here from Dakota
City to build a new house for the
Chambers family and are, still resi
dents of Niobrara. B. F. Chambers
came to Niobrara as registerer of
the United States Land office, hold
ing the position until July, 1884.
From that date until 1890 he was
engaged in the real estate business.
Mr. Chambers passed away March
11, 190G, and his wife died at her
home June 13, 1916, at the ripe age
of 83 years, 9 months and 13 days.
Two of the daughters, Mrs. Turner
and Mrs. Mason, were with their
mother the last three weeks.

Dakota City,
Vagaries of the Old Muddy
In rendering a decision involving
the title to a piece of land along the
Missouri river in Union county, S.
D., and which was formerly a part
of Dakota county, Judge McCoy of
tho supreme court of South Dakota
quotes tho following humorous
sketch in his opionion in the case:
"It is a perpetual dissatisfaction
with its bed that is the greatest pe
culiarity of the Missouri. It is
harder to suit in the matter of beds
than a traveling man. Time after
time it has gotten out of its bed in
the middle of the night, with no
apparent provocation, anchhas hunt
ed up a new bed, all littered with
forests, cornfields, brick houses, rail
road ties and telegraph poles.
Then it has suddenly taken a fancy
to its old bed, which by this time
has been filled with suburban archi
tecture, and back it has gone with a
whoop and a rush, as happy as if it
had really found something worth
while.
Quite naturally this makes life
along the Missouri a little bit un
certain. Ask the citizen of a Mis
souri river town on which side of
the river he lives, and he will look
worried, and will say: 'On the east
side When I came away.' Then he
goes home to look the matter up,
and, like as not, will find the river
on the other side of his humble home,
and a government steamboat pulling
snags out of his erstwhile cabbage
patch.
It makes farming as fascinating aa
gambling, too. You never know
whether you are going to harvest
corn or catfish. The farmer may go
blithely forth of a morning with a
twine binder to cut his wheat only
to come back at noon for a trout
line; his wheat having gone down
the river the night before.
These facts naturally lead us to
the subject of the Missouri's appe
tite. It is the hungriest river ever
created. It is eating all the time,
eating yellow clay banks and corn
fields, 80 acres at a mquthful, wind
ing up its banquet with a truck gar
den and picking its teeth with the
timbers of a big red ban is year
ly menu is 10000 acrefloi fuilKrich-,''
farming land, several m, cj of- rail
road, a few hundred houses, a forest
or two, and uncounted miles of sand
bars.
This sort of thing makes the Mis
souriivalley farmer philosophical in
the extreme. The river may take
away half his farm this year, but he
feels sure that next year it will give
him the whole farm of the fellow
above him. But he must not be too
certain. At this point the law steps
in and does a more remarkable thing
than the river itself may hope to ac
complish. It decrees that so long
as there is a Bingle yard of an own
er's land left nay, even bo long as
there is a strip wide enough to bal
ance a calf upon he is entitled to
all the land that the river may de
posit in front of it. But, when that
last yard is eaten up, oven though
the river may repent and replace the
farm in as good order as when it
took it, tho land belongs to the own
er of the land behind it."
