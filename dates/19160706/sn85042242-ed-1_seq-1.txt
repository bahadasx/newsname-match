El Paso, July 5.—Rain falling along
this section of the border and over
the northern Chihuahua section today
signalized the advent of the rainy
season, and increased the difficulties
in operating the motor transportation
system to the American troops in
Mexico.
Army men here, while' admitting
that the rainy season will hamper
the operations of the motor truck line
from Columbus south, pointed out
that adequate preparations have been
made, and General Pershing's com­
mand will not suffer as a result. In
the last few months huge quantities
of food, forage, equipment and other
supplies have been concentrated at
Colonia Dublan, Ey Valle and other
points in the State of Vases. Stress
was laid on the fact that the expedi­
tionary command now has on hand
enough supplies to provide for its
wants for sixty days, even though it
is found impossible to get another
truck through from the base at Col­
umbus-
One of the generally accepted reas­
ons for the piovements of the Ameri­
can exirediiion is that it might be
more cQm&ctly disposed, both from
a fetrategid^iew point and because of
the greater accessibility in the hand-,
ling of supplies. In the event that a
break with Mexico should yet devel
ope, military men pointed out it
would be a comparatively easy matter
for the expeditionary command, if
hampered by weather conditions, to
efcize the 'fhfrt- SfiWiSxielah tSoWli
western railway, and establish com­
munication with El, Paso for the trans­
portation of supplies.

Wj^^wicrve Best of Relations.
Gfenerlif E. Calles, military com­
mander in Sonora, issued a statement
through Consul Ives Lelevier here to­
day that he intended to preserve the
best possible relations between Mexi­
co and the United States, and along
the Arizona-Sonora boundary.
•He also announced he had sent a
description of the Mexicans suspect­
ed of killing William Parker and his
young wife, near Hachita, N. M., June
27, to the military authorities in Chi­
huahua, where they are thought to be
at present.
General Calles said he would turn

State Should Act Promptly
60,000 Prisoners.
No adequate provision has been made to transport the sick and
wounded of the First Regiment, North Dakota National Guard.
All the Hospital Corps has is an antiquated wooden army amb­
ulance. The motive power consists of four equally antiquated
mules.
The equipment is twenty years old and modeled after types
used in the Revolutionary and Civil wars.
This ambulance is without springs and does not possess the
resilience of an ice wagon.
The wheels are without rubber tires- How would you like
your boy in case of war to be bumped over Mexican roads to a
field hospital in a contraption such as the federal army depart­
ment furnishes the militia regiments?
Here is a fine opportunity for the state to do something for the
First Regiment.
Individuals throughout the length and breadth of North Da­
kota have contributed between $10,000 and $15,000 to the various
company funds in order to lessen the burdens of military service.
The STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA HAS DONE NOTHING!
Under the law it seems feasible that the Emergency Commis­
sion can make an appropriation adequate enough to purchase a
modern motor ambulance that will transport the sick and wound­
ed with dispatch and in a humane manner. The National Guard
is a department of the state government for whose maintenance
$30,000 is appropriated. Ten percent of this amount could, it is
believed, be set aside for this purpose by the Emergency Com­
mission, composed of Governor Hanna, Thomas Hall, Secretary of
State and Carl Jorgenson, State Auditor. This would be suf­
ficient to give the First Regiment a modern hospital ambulance.
Steps should be taken at once to bring the matter officially to
the attention of the Emergency Commission. The fine stalwart
men and boys who are giving the full measure of devotion to
the state should not be sent away until everything is done to
provide means to care for the sick and wounded-
That an emergency exists in this case is not even debatable.
THE STATE SHOULD ACT PROMPTLY.

The number of German prisoners
reported by the British and French

HEADING OUT
"Small grain will all be headed out
this week," declared R. if. Flint, com­
missioner of labor and agriculture,
yesterday, "and while tne moisture
has been favorable, the crop will be
much lighter, due both to less acre­
age and smaller acre yields."
"This warm weather," he contin­
ued, "is ideal for the corn, but so
many farmers failed to plant, fearing
that it would not ripen. It will pay
to take good care of me corn field,
because seed corn will be as scarce
and high as it was last year."

Witness Testifies That Cynaide of
Potassium Was Powd­
ered
STATE HAS HELD IT
WAS IN SOLUTION
Waukegon, 111., July n.—The con­
tention of the prosecution in the case
of Wm. II. Orpct, college student
charged with the murder of Marion
Lambert, that cynaide of potassium
in solution killed the girl was dealt
several blows today by Dr. YV. A.
Wessner, a chemist and toxicologic.
The very root of tin two theories
as to Marion's death is involved in
the question, whether a supersaturate
of the poison was usod or whether it
was taken in soMd or powdered l'orm.
Favors Powder Theory.
The powdered poison could have
ibeen carried by Uia^irl in a paper,
and numerous natural causes would
acount for its disappearance.
Dr. Wct.snor nave a wcaltL1 of re.a*
ons for his theory that the cynaide
was taken in powdered form.
Chemists for the state some time
ago testified that three white, spots
left on Marion's green outer coat was
caused by a sturate solution of the
poison. The depth to which the resi­
due was imbedded in the fabric and
the irregular shape of the spots were
pointed out as proving this theory.
Spots Impossible Otherwise.
"Those spots," said Dr. Wessner
today, "could not have been made by
a super-saturate. I have experiment­
ed and found that the drop would not
stay on the fabric at all, but would
roll off like globules of mercury or
drops of water on a hot stove."
Witness asserted that the same
was true of the stains on Marion's
hands—they could have been left
there only by a moist powder. A sup­
er-saturate, he said, would have roll­
ed off as it would have from the coat.
It would have left no marks.
"Took Poison In Hands."
The theory of the defnse as to just
how the poison was taken developed
in the course of the examination of
the witness. It \v is said she took the
poison in her hands, and removed it
or parts of it with her tongue. This
moistened the powder, remaining in
her hands, and it remained in the in­
equalities and lines of the hands. It

cause of Train Wreck
Near Orciz
Chihuahua, Mex., July 4 (via El
Paso Junction, July 5).—General Ig
nacio Ramos was killer :n a fierce
and bloody battle that raged all yes­
terday at Corral ranch, f5 miles
southwest of Giminez, between a
small force of de facto troops a"nd
several regiments of Viilistas. Both
sides suffered heavy looses.
Rather than retire to Giminez with­
out carrying out his orders, which
were not to retire unless he was able
to report success, General Ramos
fought to the death in his entrench­
ment, cheering his men on to the last.
The Carran/.a roops were surrounded
Monday at daybreak, and for more
than 12 hours held their positions
against repeated attacks. The odds
against the defenders were heavy, but
they stuck to their guns in the hope
that reinforcements would soon ar­
rive.
At nightfall, after their leader had
been killed and the greater part of
he command killed or wonndedt the
survivors retired to Giminez, carry­
ing their wounded with them. Three
times during the day the Vniistas
dashed through a storm or shot to the
edge of the Carranzista forces'
trenches, but were unable to tafce
them.
Reinforcements, which "iad been or­
dered to form a junction with Gen.
Ramos' troops at Corral, were delay*
ed by a wreck near Orciz, and the
proposed central offensive against^the
Villistas did not materialize.
Following the Corral clash, the gar­
rison at Santa Rosalia, was rushed
south to hold Giminez against any at­
tack. In the meantime, 2,000 roops,
including the famous brigade of Do­
mingo Arreta, were sent south to at­
tack the force which cut off Gen. Ra­
mos.
General Maclovio Garc-a, who is in
charge of the campaign, is keeping in
constant touch wth General Trevino.

A tourist party, including the par­
ents of Mrs. Robert F. Flint, enroute
home to Spokane, Wash., broke an
axle of their car near Crown Butte
Sunday. They came to Mandan and
waited for repair parts. This morn­
ing the party returned to Crown Butte
with McDonald, who

McDonald beneath it.
A wire was sent to Mandan from

be sent to Crown Rutte Immediately.
