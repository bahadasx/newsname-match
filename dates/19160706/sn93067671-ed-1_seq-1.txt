AN AUTOMAT(
The Pickens Bank Installs New
Burroughs Adding-Subtract.
lng Riachine to keep
Books
A real mechanical marvel is the new
bookkeeping machine that has just been
installed at the Pickens Bank. The
machine is the Burroughs Adding-Sab
tracting Model and will greatly simpli
fy the work of keeping the bank's books.
One should see this Burroughs in op
eration to fully appreciate wvhat a won
derful thing it is. It automatically
prints dlates, subtracts checks, adds de
p)osits and comp~utes new balances, all
in one movament of the carriage across
the page, and wvith a speed that seems
incredible. That is to say, the machine
not only posts figures to the ledger
page, but computes balances aatomat
ically as the posting is done.
ERROR-PROOF "STEEL BRAINS"
And this automatic bookkeeper can't
make a mistake. His "steel brains"~
are mathematically error-proof. De
pressing the keys puts figures "into"
the Burroughs. Touching a bar adds or
subtracts the figures and prints them
in even rows. And no matter how fasts
or how long you feed figures into it, the
machine never gets tired, never lets
,errors creep in through "brain fag."
It has just as lively an appetite for tire
large numbers as for smiall. As a de
positor you might deponit $10,000,000
tomorrow, but the machine would not
have to exert itself to enter the amount,
add your old1 balance, subtract your
checks and automatically compute the
correct new balance of your account.
Trho only time it balks is when you have
an overdIraft. Theni it warns the oper
ator, by the simple expedient of refus
ing to figure any more without the
"subtract lever-is held (down, that your
account is overdrawn, and thereupon
proceeds to print a redl "'OD'. sinaln

opposite the amount you need to get
square with the bank.
Heretofore, in posting to the ledger
It was necessary for a list of checks
and deposits to be entered by hand in
order for the bank to properly debit
and credit each customer's account. The
bookkeepers had to iqdd each list of
checks mentally, also had t~o add all
deposits and combine their'total with
the customer's old balance. When that
was done the total of all checks had to
be deducted from the sum of old bal
ance and deposits to dletermine new bal
ance. With the machine all this is ac
complished automatically and without
any mental calculation wvhatever. Trhe
operator has only to depress the proper'
keys an'tj touch the operating bar.
Blurroughs-postedI ledgers have many.
advantages that even a person not fa
miliar with bookkeeeping will recog
nize. As explained all figuring is done
mechanically, the operator being obliged
only to watch the amount he is enter
ing.
Then, in addition tothe speed and
economy such a method affords, there
is the infallible accuracy accruing to the
use of the machine. The precision with
which the interior mechanism operates
insures an exactitude hertofore uin
known in figure work.
'rhe adaptability. of the machine is
another feature of its usefullness. It
can be adjusted to an infinite number
of combinations. It may be used as an
ordlinary adding machine, or as a straight
subtracting machine. It may be used
for posting to the ledger or making out
depositors' statements. And figures
whether simnple or complicated, are gob
bled up with equal facility -by the insa
tiable appetite of its mechanical works.
Theire is no human belilg wvho can list
and add a long column of figures at thec
same time with speed and with abso
lute accuracy, but the Burroughs does
it. Adv.
