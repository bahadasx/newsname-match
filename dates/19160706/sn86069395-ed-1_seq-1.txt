ANSWERS WITH
A
Note Conciliatory and Argu
mentive After Long
Delay.
AN ULTIMATUM NEEDED
Leaves The Actual Settlement
Still a Matter of Further
Correspondence.
Washington, July 5. Gen. Carran
za's formal reply to the two sharp
notes he has received from the Wash
ington government, regarding tho sit
uation on the border and in northern
Mexico wds received July 4.
A verbal synopsis of the communi
cation made public by embassy
attaches with the approval of Mr. Ar
rendondo, indicates that it is of an un
expected conciliatory character.
Lacking the text of the note, it
was. impossible to say whether it
would prove satisfactory to President
Wilson. Since the rcleaso of the
American troopers taken at Carrizal'
the question at issue between the
Washington government and Gen.
Carranza has been narrowed to Mr.
Wilson's desire for a formal declara
tion of intention toward the Ameri
can expeditionary forces in Mexico.
The embassy" Synopsis of the new
note indicates that a specificstatement
is still lacking.
According to the embassy synopsis
of the communication which officials
believe was prepared personally by
Gen. Carranza, it renews assurances
that the defacto government will re
store order in northern Mexico and
establish an adequate guard against
border raiders. It is said to suggest
that the presence of American troops
in Mexico serves only to increase un
settled conditions in the border states
but not to make any new demand for
their withdrawal.
It is not known whether any men
tion is made of previous orders to
Gen. Trevino that American troops be
ittackcd if they move east, south or
west in Mexico. Apparently the com
munication avoids the definite diplo
matic statement in that regard sought
by Secretory Lansing, and substitutes
an argument as to the general situa
tion. The note also is said to point out
that the principle of mediation as sug
gested by various Latin-American
powers has been accepted by the de
facto government and to invite the
Washington administration to express
its views. Gen. Carranza believes
lowever, more could be accomplish
ed by direct negotiations between
Washington and Mexico city officials
than would be possible through me
diation proceedings.
Tho war department continued with
out abatement today its efforts to
complete mobilization of national
guards at the border.

Mr. J. D. Scarborough has been
transferred from Hopkinsville to this
city as manager of the W. A. Cham

BIG CROWD
Informal Celebration at Vir
ginia' Park on The Glo
rious Fourth.
The celebration of the Fourth of
July at Virginia Park Tuesday night
from 8 to 9:30 o'clock proved to be a
very successful affair, though without
much preparation in advance. It was
largely informal, but probably 1500
people attended and some fine and
stirring short addresses were made.
Messrs. C. F. Jarrett and C. A.
Brasher jointly presided but at their
request Chas. M. Meacham intro
duced the speakers.
The invocation was pronounced by
Rev. J. N. Jessup, of the Christian
church. This was followed by music
by an orchestra of fiddlers, W. F.
Randle, T. E. Bartley, S. T. Fruit,
Harry Carroll, Robt. McCarroll and
S. E. Yancev.
Speeches, interspersed with music,
were made by Claude Clark, Oi?lesby
Soyars, Thos. C. Underwood, Robt.
Brumfield and W. R. Howell.
All were typical fourth-of-July ora
tions, intensely patriotic and greatly
appreciated. Frequent bursts of ap
plause interrupted the speakers and
everybody was pleased with thd cele
bration. As a special feature of the
program, Miss Virginia Pursley
beautiful recited "The Blue and the
Gray" and at the conclusion the
presiding officers one clad in bine and
the other in gray arose and clasned
hands amid great applause. The
crowd dispersed to the sweet strains
of patriotic airs played by the "old
fiddlers."

The Elks held their annual nicnic
iit Campbell's Cave and a fine dinner
was served and all enjoyed the occa
sion greatly.
