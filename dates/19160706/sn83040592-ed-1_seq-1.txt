Do you really want war? Don't
you know that if this country
gets into a war it will bring on
hard times? Don't you know
that this country is now having
the best and most prosperous
times the world has ever known?
Don't you know that if the United
States should go to war an ex
pense would be incurred which
the youngest child now living
would not see wiped out if it lived
to be a hundred years old? Don't
you knbw' you would be taxed
every time you turned around?
And all those taxes would be
needed to meet the expenses of
the war. And do you really think
for a minute that you want your
boy used for cannon fodder? Do
you want to see your neighbor
boys go off to war and come back
maimed for life, wrecked in
health, and perhaps not come
back at all? Are you a condemned
fool? Of course you are not.
You are mighty thankful that
this country is not at war with
any other nation, and you are
hoping and praying that this
country will not get into war,
even though it looks as if it could
not be avoided? When you get
off by yourself to think it over
you do not want war. You know
you do not. But if there is war,
will you go, or will you urge the
other fellow to go? Oh, pshaw,
you are bluffing, and you know
it
A package of yeast mailed by
a patron on one of the rural
routes out of this city exploded
in the carrier's wagon on his re
turn trip to the local postoffice,
and the result was he had to laun
der about 150 pieces of mail.
The yeast was in a quart tin can,
and fermented, hence the explo
sion. Jim Goodwin and Roy Harvey
have some good holdings just
north of Picher. The land his
been drilled, and they have sub
leased it The drilling shows
very rich dirt, and shafts are now
being sunk on the land. Work
on a big modern mill will begin
within the next thirty days.
We are still cutting meat for
the poor same as the rich at the
Sanitary Meat Market. Prices

Must Have Sewers.
Baxter springs must nave
sewer system. The way to go
about it is on the petition plan.
Pick out the district the sewers
should be built in, petition the
city council to declare a benefit
district, and order the sewers
built The property benefited
will have to pay the cost, and
this can be paid with tax bills
strung out over a period of years
at a low rate of interest. Plenty
of contractors will do the work
on terms of that sort All the
city would have to build would
be where the mains cross the
streets, and the city can very
easily do that If we are to have
a really good town we must have
sewer systems, me ultra con
aervative fellows who never want
to spend a dollar must be shelved,
or sat on. me town must be
pushed to the front now today.
Outsiders are developing the ter
ritory adjacent to the town. We
people in town must develop the
town, and make it a good place
for people to live. There is not
another town in the world where
sewer system could be put in
as cheaply.
We trust the commercial club
will take this matter up right
away. It should not be delayed
another day.
Let's step along.
Are you with us in this move?
The columns of the News are
still open for suggestions.

The soldier boys who have
passed through this city this
week on their way to the border
of Mexico have little realization
of what they may be going up
against Many of them nave
never roughed it, and certainly
they are not fit subjects to go
against the climate of Mexico.
t may seem like a play spell
to them, while making the trip,
although they looked worn when
they passed through here. Some
of them said when they left New
York atate they wore overcoats.
By the time they reached Baxter
Springs they had shed all the
clothes they could and look de
cent The waters down in Mex
ico are not conducive to good
health, and those fellows, most
of whom are mere boys, will have
a hard time of it No, we do not
want to see war. We want those
boys to be sent home to their
parents and sweethearts. You
jingoes, who talk war. don't real
ly know what you are talking
about.

To The People of
a. n. C ' .
w
So many people have come to
Baxter Springs to live that it has
become impossible for any more
to secure bouses or even rooms.
Every house is now occupied.
Baxter people should endeavor to
supply the extra demand as far
as possible. To this end we wil
request that all parties having
one or more rooms to. rent to re
port the same to D. Martin, Sec
retary of the Commercial Club,
who will take pains to direct
those hunting rooms to you. All
parties desiring rooms please ap
ply to D. Martin, Sec'y.
Taking the Home
Paper.
Do you know of a person in
this whole community who would
be willing to go through life
month by month and year by year
without a knowledge of the news
features of the township in which
he resides? Would you like to be
that person? It is difficult to
convince the average reader of
tne real value oi ms uotue paper
unless he has at some time or
other been forced to do without
it Then it is that its value is
brought borne to them. Most
people subscribe for the home
paper, read it, enioy it, and ab
sorb the news it contains as a
matter of course, giving scarcely
a thought to the vast amount of
labor entailed in the production
of the issue. And yet that issue
means a tremendous concentra
tion of thought and energy and
perseverance on the part of both
the editor and his entire force of
resented on an issue of this paper,
for instance, costs the reader a
very few cents. Would you like
to fill the editor's shoes for a
week, or a month, or permanent
ly? Would you consider that the
labor thus involved had met with
just compensation?

The City Dads are doing aome
good work on the streets this
spring. This week the Militar y

North street will be gravelled and
the River street hill will be cut

cured to do the work.
Miss Daisy B. Higgins, daugh
ter of Mr. and Mrs. James N. Hig
gins of this city, died at the home
of her parents in the north part
of town on June 29th. She was
17 years, 8 months and 6 days
old. The remains were taken to
Marsh field, Mo., for interment
July 2.
Joplin people are clamoring for
a grave! road forty feet wide from
that town down into the new
Baxter field. Well, we are will
ing for the Joplin fellows to have
just as wide and just as good a
road as they feel like building.
And we might be induced to help
them build just that sort of a
road.
The troop traina which have
been going through this city for
the past week are a eoutce of at
traction for all the inhabitants
of the town. The young ladies,
especially, like the looks of the
soldier boys. Many of the trains
carried guns of all kinds, from
the rifles of the infantry, to the
big guns of the artillery. Several
of the, trains carried horses for
the cavalry.

ENCOURAGING
INDUSTRY AND THRIFT, WE CONSIDER
A MOST WORTHY AIM
ECONOMISTS agree there are just two es
sentials in the production of wealth labor and
self-denial. No amount of industry without
economy and no amount of economy without
industry will result in accumulation.
IT IS THE POLIGY OF THIS BANK
to encourage thrift and economy along prac
tical lines. People using our Bank Account
Plan find it practical in operation, the tangible
results well worth while. No account too
large, none too small, to receive careful consid
eration and protection.

In The Mud
If you were shown a good road around a mud puddle,
yet as a choice proceeded to wade through the mud, people
would say you were foolish and you would be.
If a better plan for caring for your money than by
keeping it in the house, hiding it under the bed, burying it
in the cellar or secreting it in a sock, were shown you, the
modern way of putting it in a reliable bank, for instance,
and you still handled your money the old way, what
would they say? It would be as foolish to follow the old
custom as to walk in the mud when there was a good
road in plain sight
