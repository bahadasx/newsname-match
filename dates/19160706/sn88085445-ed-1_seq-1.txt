BERRY SEASON HERE;
WILL BARREL CROP
The bulk of tho local raspberry
crop will be barrelled thH year at
' the Lynden Cannery, according to a
| decision of tbe growers reached
! last week.
H. A. Baker of Chicago hag con
cluded arrangements' with the
growers to purchase the fruit. The
cannery will be opened up to re
ceive the berries, and the fruit M I
Ibe placed in barrels, and snipped
! out from there.
The price the growers will re
ceive for the fruit Is 3>,i
cents a pound. This will net them
considerably less than If the fruit
were shipped fresh, but as the en
tire crop can be sold this way with
less attention paid to picking, a
fair profit can be made.
Thej work of the pickers will be
considerably easier this year under
the barrel plan, and much more
profitable. The crop will be ready
for picking next week, and those
who wish to work us phkers
should get in their applications now
to the growers.
Mr. Bakor will f .-rnlsh all boxes
and crates, and payments will be
made every Monday. All growers
who wish to do ho may bring their
fruit to tho canner". The plckli g
