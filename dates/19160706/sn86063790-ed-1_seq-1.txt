BIG PROGRAMME OF FINANCIA]

N ' Washington, July 2.?Congress i
preparing to complete its programm
of financial preparedness with ever
indication that appropriations thi
session will aggregate considerabl
more than a billion and a half dol
lars, at least half a billion of whic
will be for national defence.
According to estimates based o
figures compiled by Chairman Fit2

in the nation's history.
Last week Representative Fitzgei

house showing that the grand tot?

bills passed and pending, woul

carry $282,000,000 and $315,826

^BB the fortifications bill, which has pass
|m ed both houses, would appropriat
for national defence more than $622
000,000. There is every indicatio
that the senate will accept at leas
the major part of the proposed arm
and navy increases, but conference
probably will pare them down. Whal

both houses agree that the total c
/ . appropriations will break all records
The senate plans to take up th
naval bill as soon as the agriculture

as soon as it is ready, setting asid
the naval ,bill temporarily.
, Ready, for Revenue Bill.
With its work on appropriation
. nearing completion the house is read
to take up the $210,000,000 revenu
bill introduced yesterday. The hous
|| adjourned from yesterday to nex
Wednesday and the revenue measur
' is expected to come up Thursday un
*%, der a special rule and b? passed Sat
^ i urday. Then the house will mar]
time waiting for the senate to catcl
? up. Besides several of the big sup
, ply measures, the senate has the ship
ping bill, the child labor bill, the $2,
000,000 militia relief measure, con
f
servation measures, the immigratioi
bill and many minor matters to dis
pose of.
If there is to be an adjournmen
in time for the political campaign
congress leaders believe some of th
measures of the president's legisla
tive programme must be sacrificed
They believe the immigration bil
t and perhaps the conservation meas
ures cah be delayed until the 6hor
session.
| In spite of the crowded senate cal
endar and the threatened Mexica:
situation, the subject of adjournmen
constantly is discussed about th
Capitol. The house could adjouri
\ within a few weeks, but senate lead
ers say that under the most favoi
ablSi circumstances they could no
possibly get through before the mid

p KILLING NEAR EDGEFIELD.
Two Men Get in a Row During Drill
L Preparatory for the Fourth.
Edgefield, June 28.?Monday afternoon
Archie Mayson was killed by
Wallace Waldo, the homicide occurring
.on the plantation of Dr.. Frank
Jones, a mile from town. The parties
are negroes. From the evidence takof
fVio nnrnnor'c irmilPSt it aDDears
that a crowd of negroes were drilling
preparing for a celebration to be held
on the fourth of next month, wooden
v guns being used. After drilling for
some time, some one fired a pistol
k and Waldo accused the deceased of
having fired the shot, whereupon
, Archie is said to have called him a
it
, liar, and threatened to shoot his
n head off accompanying his words by
drawing a pistol and pointing it on
Waldo and, snapping it at him. At
0 this time Waldo is said to have struck
the deceased over the head with a
gun, fracturing the skull, causing
death in a few hours. The defend'
ant was admitted to bail by Judge
, DeVore in the sum of a thousand dollars.
Immediately after the killing
^ Sheriff Swearingen went to the scene

Two Troops of Eighth Cavalry, neaoy
ed by Capt. Eltinge, Enter Mexico.
L- .
San Antonio, Texas, July 2.?Capt.
Leroy Eltinge, with two troops of the
5" Sth cavalry, searched the country on
11 the Mexican side of the river oppoy
site Fort Hancock, Texas, today for
" bandits who yesterday fled into Mexk
ico after raiding the American side.
Late today no information concern6
ing his movements had been received
- at Gen. Funston's headquarters. It
Q was expected that unless he discover^
ed a "hot trail" he would return to
y the American side, perhaps tonight.
8 Capt. Eltinge crossed the Rio
Grande yesterday afternoon at 5:30
picked up the trail and followed it a
short distance, but found that it led
back toward the river at a point lowe
er down. He was unable to discover
an indication by that ^ime as to the
L" location of the bandits, and recrossed
to the. American side. Early today
e he led his two troops back into Mexico,
but reported that unless he found
some tangible evidence ou which to
e base the pursuit he would return late
e today or tonight,
t Slight Chances.
e Gen. Bell, in his report of the incident
to Gen. Funston, gave the im
pression that the chances for locat8
ing the raiders were slight. The best
y information obtainable indicated
e txtotd nnlv oicTlt MAYlOflTIR in thft
e raiding party, whicn drove off a few
* head of horses and cattle yesterday
e from a ranch fifty-four miles south"
east of El Paso.
" Lieut. Hardy, with part of one
^ troop, followed their trail to a point
k where it ended at the river, and Capt.
Eltinge several hours later arrived
with two troops from El Paso to con "
tinue the pursuit if he considered it
" advisable. He was instructed not to
a precipitate a clash with Mexican
h troops if it could be avoided.
Capt. Eltinge's report made no
* mention of encountering any Mexil?
can troops.
e All reports received at Gen. Fun "
ston's headquarters indicated noth^
in? morA. exciting: along: the inter
* national line than an exchange of
l~ shots between sentries at Nogales.
* To Avoid Clashes.
All officers commanding troops
along the 1,700 miles of border have
Q been cautioned to avoid clashes with
* the Mexican troops that face them,
e but the recurrence of such incidents
a as that at Nogales has caused staff
" officers to fear that an incident may
" o^cur at any time that may serve as
* the^sis for further complexing the
L" situation.

Carranza's Reply Said to Be Concilia- *
tory. *
Washington, July 4.?Gen. Carranza's
reply to the two sharp notes -j
from the Washington government
was at the Mexican embassy tonight
and a verbal synopsis, made public
with the arrival of Eliseo Arredondo, ^
Carfranza's ambassador designate,
indicated that it was of an unexpect- ^
edly conciliatory character. * \
The formal communication arrived t
by telegraph early in the day and j
only the fact that the fourth of July
was being celebrated by all govern- .
ment departments, prevented its immediate
delivery. It will be present- .
ed at the State department tomorrow.
j
Mr. Arredondo himself spent the
day ih the country and on his return 4
declined to discuss his government's J
attitude as now officially stated. ^
Lacking the text of the note, it ^
was impossible tonight to say whether
it would prove satisfactory to ^
President Wilson. Since the release (
of the American troopers taKen at j
Carrizal, the question at issue between
the Washington government
and Gen. Carranza has been narrowed
to Mr. Wilson's desire for a form- 1
al declaration of intention toward
the American expeditionary forces in
Mexico. The embassy synopsis of the
new note indicates that a specific 1
statement stilt is lacking. 1

WAR LAST RESORT.
United States Not Servant of Property
Holders in Mexico. 0
New York, June 30.?President
Wilson made it plain in his speech at
:he New York Press club banquet to- ^
light that he will not countenance a
;var with Mexico until there is no
yther alternative for settling the borier
troubles.
He declared again that he was f
ready to sacrifice his own political .
fortunes in order to carry out. his j.
convictions as to wftat would be the ^
just course to pursue in the situa- ,
t
Lion.
The president's audience, composr
3d of newspaper men, State and mu- ^
aicipal political leaders and others
prominent in public life, signified
their endorsement of his position by
repeated outbursts of applause. When ^
he asked if the glory of America
would be enhanced by a war of con- ^
luest in Mexico, shouts of "no" came f
from all parts of the banquet hall. A.
similar response was made to his
iuer,y whether it is America's duty
to "carry self-defence to the point of ^
dictation* into the affairs of another t
people."
The president dwelt also on his etforts
to serve the whole people, thousands
of whom, he said, are appeal- j
ing to him to maintain peace as long
is possible. .
Servant of the People. r
"I have constantly to remind my- .
self," he said,, "that I am not the
servant of those who wish to enhance .
the value of their Mexican invest- t
ments, but that I am the servant ot t
the rank and file of the people of ^
the United States."

fiedly that he would support him in c
the coming campaign, as it was re- ^
ported he would do.
Sticking by the Ship.
"I am a Progressive/' he said. "I j
was one of the party's organizers. I
shall stick by the ship until it is rec- g
agnized by passengers, crew and ofdcers

iREAT BRITISH 0FEENS1VE
OFFENSIVE ALONG 25 MILES OF
FRONT.
lermans Driven Back Five Miles.
Greatest Bombardment World '
Has Ever Known.
British and French troops, thrown
rward in a great offensive against
he German lines on both sides of the
tfver Somme, 60 miles north of
'aris, have penetrated at one point
o a depth of five miles; t^aken sevral
villages and captured a labyinth
of trenches extending to a
epth of 1,000 yards on a front of
even miles.
The drive, the most spectacular in
his region since the British captured
ioos last September, began Saturday
norning after the German tranches
lad been subjected to a hail of shells
rom guns of every calibre for days,
'rogress has been reported along the
ntire front of about 25 miles.
The greatest success gained by the
British was on the right. In the cenre
they captured what are designatd
in the official report as "many
trong points," along a front of four
niles. But north of the Ancre valey
to Gommecourt powerful counter,ttacks
by the Germans have resulted
n forcing the British back from vaious
sections of the ground gained
n their first onslaughts.
The town of Albert was the startng
point of one of the fiercest fights,
he British advancing from east of
he ttffrn to Montauban, more than
tve miles away, .Besides lvionutuuitu
tnd Serre, the villages of Hebuterne,
V
ja, Boisselle and Mametz have been
aptured. Two thousand German
irisoners have passed through the
British collecting stations.
In cooperation with the British the
"Tench initiated a strong offensive,
louth of the Somme they captured
our villages and north of" that river
hey established themselves in the
teighborhood of Hardecourt and Curu.
The number of German prispnrrs
taken by the French had reached
1,500 up to the time of the sending
if the last official report.
The recapture of the famous ThiauQont
work on the Verdun front by
he French also has been effected,
"his important strategic point has
hanged hands several times and
round it probably thousands of men
iave fallen. On the left bank of the
leuse, the fighting is most intense
round fiill 304, Le Mort Homme
nd Avocourt.
In the Trentino the Italians con^
Inue to advance along the entire
'osina line and- the Arsena valley,
irtillery bombardments mark the acion
on the rest of the Austro-Italian
ront.
While the Russians report progress
outh of the Dniester river, in Gat
icia, the Austro-Germans claim the
apture of Russian works west and
orthwest of Lutzsk, especially in the
icinity of Sokul, Volhynia.
Maintaining their drive against
he Austrians in Galicia in the region
f Kolomea, the Russians have capured
many villages. Northwest of
[impolung, Bukowina, the. Russians
Iready are in the mountains and
hey report the seizure of several
trong positions. Attacks of Gerlan
troops in the region of the Lipa
iver were repulsed with heavy losses,

benefit to the United States
should the course of events cause a

service of the 35,000 regulars
guarding the border by substitution
of National Guardsmen, but in the
concentration of supplies for a big
campaign, the mobilization of transport
facilities and the rehabilitation
of the flying arm of the service.
The activities of the quartermaster's
department of the southern division
have been diminished in no
way since the report was received
that the American prisoners taken at
Carrizal would be surrendered to the
American authorities. The department
has continued to arrange for
camp sites for the numerous National
Guard units not yet started for the
border. Bids will be opened here ,
July 1 for tremendous quantities of
provisions. Included will be requisitions
for 180,000 pounds of beads,
16,000 pounds of rye, 1?0,000 cans
of tomatoes, 180,000 pounds of coffee,
180,000 pounds of sugar, 45,000
pounds of prunes, 20,000 pounds of
evaporated peaches, 54,000 cans of
jam, 100,000 pounds of salt and 66,- ~
000 pounds of tobacco.
It ie estimated that the forage for
horses and mules used by the anrfy
will cost the United States nearly
$950,000 a month, while approximately
$4'0,OOO will be used for ga?oline.

The pay of officers and men on the 7 f

CASEMENT SENTENCED TO DIE.
?? ^7
Irish Knight Declared by British Jury
Guilty of High Treason.
,
London, June 29.?Viscount Reading,
lord chief justice of England,
with the black cloth by tradition
called a cap, spread over his head,
(
and his two associates in scarlet
c**
gowns likewise black-capped, pronounced
the sentence of death for
high treason on the Irishman, Sir
Roger Casement, shortly before 5
o'clock this afternoon, half an hour; .
after the foreman of the jury, in a
shaking voice, gave the verdict of
guilty.
After the verdict had been return*
ed Sir Roger began to read a very
long statement.
Sir Roger received the sentence
with the utmost composure, smiling
at his friends in the court room. His
statement was a plea for the right to
*
be tried by Irishmen and for Irish
nationality.
After Sir Roger nad been sentenced,
Daniel J. Bailey, a private
soldier, who had been held as his
accomplice, was placed in the dock.
The chief justice directed the jury ,
to return a verdict of not guilty and
Bailey was discharged.
The attorney general announced
Bailey had affirmed he joined the
Irish brigade with the object of returning
to his country and rejoining
the army. Under the circumstances
no y evidence would be produced
against him.
Michael Francis Doyle, of Philadelphia,
of counsel for Sir Roger, gave
the following statement tonight to
the Associated Press: r Ai
"The verdict, tnough regrettable
to us, was not a surprise. We will
take an immediate appeal to the
criminal court of appeals and then to
the house of lords, if necessary, because
we feel that the point of law
involving a statute 500 years old under
which Sir Roger was tried never
has been legally tested."
