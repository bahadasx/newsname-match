Between Two Nations
Washington, D. C.Carranza 's
reply to the demands of the A
merican government reached the
Mexican embassy here Tuesday
and was delivered to the state de
partment yesterday.
Its tone is conciliatory and will
offer a basis foramicable adjust
ment of difficulties between the
two governments.
As all Washington was cele
brating the Fourth of July, Eliseo
Arredondo, the Mexican ambas
sador designate, made no attempt
to seek an immediate engagement

stead he directed an embassy em

'. ' According to the information
available, the note, believed to
have been-dictated" by Carranza
himself, renews assurances that
adequate forces of the dc facto
government are engaged in sup
pressing brigandage in northern
Mexico and protecting the inter
national line; admits that a seri
ous situation exists, but again
suggests that the presence of A
merican troops aggravates rather
than helps matters; and paves
the way for resumption of dis
cussions in regard to a border
protection protocol, the subject
of the first notes which passed be
tween the two governments.
It is in reply to both 'the last
two notes sent to the de facto gov
ernment by Secretary Lansing
and is said to bring the issue be
tween the two governments down
to date.
There is said to be no specific
renewal of the demands for the
recall of the Pershing expedition
or threat of attacks but at the
same time the request of Secre
tary Lansing for a statement of
intentions is met by a general dis
cussion of the situation rather
than by a direct announcement of
purposes.
The Mexican government states
that it has accepted in principle
suggestions f " mediation from
other American republics and in
vites the United States likewise
to record itself. It adds, howev
er, that diplomatic relations be
tween the two governments con
cerned should bring more satis
factory results than mediation.
The national guard troops will
continue to move forward as rap
idly as they complete mobiliza
tion. The withdrawal of the ex
pedition toward the border, while
it has served to improve the dip
lomatic situation was decided up
on by the military authorities for
purely military reasons. As his
force is disposed Pershing is ap-
parently in the best of positions
to maintain his line of communi
cation and defend himself in the
event of an attack in force from
the Carranza troops which have
advancM steadily behind him.
The Clearwater Sun of June
24th prints a page from Confed
erate history giving a thrilling ac
count of the first submarine craft
ever constructed. It was devised
and built by "Messrs. Hundley
and McClintock at Mobile, and
launched in 1864. It was taken
to Charleston, and after several
luckless attempts to submarine
some of the big gunboats of the
enemy, it was finally hurled a
gainst the Ilousatonic, and both
went to the bottom after the sub
marine had done its work. In
after years the remains of the two
boats were found, the little tor
pedo boat by the side of the
giant it had slain, with the bones
of the heroic dead, in the wreck
age. Ocala Banner.
Another beauty of our primary
law has been discovered, in that a
man may be elected to the govern
orship or to any other office, and
neither he nor any one else ever
know it. ' For instance, Hudson,
Farris and Wood, not being" high
men" on first choice rotes, were
eliminated from the count. But
either of them might have had
enough second choice votes, taken
from the other candidates, so that
when added to their first choice
they might lead both Knott and
Catts. The deeper you get into
this primary thing, the more won

STATE DIVISION
Sentiment Growing and Legisla
ture May Act
Throughout all sections of the
state, and particularly in the east
and west coast sections of south
Florida, the demand for state di
vision is growing rapidly and the
next legislature undoubtedly will
be strongly urged to put the
question to a rote of the people.
The matter has been brought up
heretofore, but with little force
behind it, as a result of which th?
necessity "of making a united ef
fort is now realized by south
Floridians.
There is no reason why two
sections that differ as widely as
south Florida and north and
northwest Florida should be
bound together as one state, and
this fact has been driven home to
all progressive thinking . people.
lhe limes is pleased indeed at
the interest being displayed in
this movement and hopes every
legislator from south Florida will
be pledged without delay to vote
in favor of submission of a divis
ion amendment. Tampa Times.

KNOTT'S REASONS GIVEN
For Proceeding in the Court to Have a Re-Count of the
tor Governor in Many Counties of the State
The great and wide-spread in-
A A. . .1. 1
leiesi in me guDernaionai
contest now on, justifies The Her
ald in copying from the Jackson
ville Times-Union of last Thurs
day the following statement of
the grounds upon which Mr.
Knott bases his action:
Court proceedings have been
begun by attorneys in behalf of
W. V. Knott, gubernatorial candi
date, for a recount of the vote in
certaui precincts of at least twenty-seven
counties of Florida. It
is alleged from information re
ceived by attorneys at the head
quarters of Mr. Knott here in
Jacksonville that there are more
than seventy-five precincts in
whieh the second choice vote was
not counted, or included in the of
ficial returns made to Tallahassee.
In most cases it is alleged these
votes were improperly tallied and
it was impossible for the canvass
ing board to ascertain to whom
they properly belonged. The seventy-five
or more precincts not
oounted embraced 1,500 to 2,000
votes, it is alleged.
The friends of Mr. Knott con
tend that when these votes are
properly counted and accredited,
he will easily overcome the lead
of 260 votes of Mr. Catts. .
Mandamus for recount has
been granted in a number of
counties. The sheriffs of Suwan
nee, Hamilton and Madison coun
ties were yesterday serving the
inspectors and clerks with notice
to appear and recount the votes
of these counties.
Thomas B. Adams, of counsel
for Mr. Knottr stated that it was
not the intention of the counsel
for Mr. Knott to stop the fight un
til every single vote in the state
has been recounted where it is
believed that irregularities or er
rors exist.
Many Irregularities
The worst irregularities are al
leged to exist in Polk, Holmes
and Calhoun counties. In Polk
county it is alleged that several
hundred nbn-Democratic voters
evidently cast a vote. In one
precinct in Calhoun county with
fifty-nine qualified voters on the
registration book, 140 votes were
polled. In other precincts, close
to the Alabama line, people living
in Alabama, it is also alleged,
were allowed to vote. In speak
ing of the matter yesterday Mr.
Adams stated:
"We only want the votes which
were cast for Mr. Knott in the
primary of June 6. We propose
to prosecute mandamus proceed
ings until every vote is properly
credited to Mr. Knott that was
cast for him and we believe that
when these votes are given him
he will easily be the nominee of
the party with several hundred
votes to spare."
In Baker, Putnam and Pasco
counties those representing Mr.
Knott have, it is claimed, been
denied the privilege of examining
the tally books and poll lists. Vig
orous steps will be taken to be
allowed to examine the records of
the election under chapter 5942,
laws of 1909, sections 1 and 2,
which provide as follows:
Section 1: That all state, coun
ty and municipal records at all
times be open for a personal in
spection of any citizen of Flori
da, and those in charge of such
records shall not refuse this pri
vilege to any citizen.
Section 2: That any official who
shall violate the provisions of sec
tion 1 of this act shall be subject
to removal or impeachment.
Where Suits Will be Filed
The followinz is a list of the
counties in which action may be
expected and "the reasons assign
ed: Polk county. It is claimed
that in Fort Meade precinct sec
ond choice votes were not count
ed, notwithstanding the fact that
Messrs. Farris, Hudson and Wood
received a large vote. There is a
possible 250 or 300 second choice
votes. It is also alleged that in
Lakeland precinct there were on
ly 630 registered Democrats with
more than 400 Republicans and
Socialists. The poll list, it is said,
Vote
shows that 950 votes were cast.
In Winter Haven there were 300
registered Democrats and more
than 200 Republicans and Social
ists. This precinct, it is said,
cast 410 votes. These two pre
cincts went more than 2 to 1 in
favor of Catts. A contest will be
filed and effort made to eliminate
the alleged illegal votes cast.
Ilillsboro county: It is claimed
that in several precincts outside
Tampa many voters who belong
ed to other than the Democratic
party and who supported the
nominee of other parties in the
last general election were allowed
to vote in the primary of June 6.
This matter has been looked into
by lawyers in Tampa and they
take the vitw that under section
41 of the primary law such vot
ers cannot qualify to vote in the
late primary. The precincts in
question gave a large majority to
Catts.
Worst County in State
Holmes county: In this county
the alleged conditions reported
are worse than in any other coun
ty in the state. The second choice
votes in a number of precincts
were, it is alleged, so improperly
tallied that the canvassing board
could not count them and a re
count of more than half of the
precincts of that county will be
asked as a result of this and it is
felt by Mr. -Knott's friends that
he will make substantial gains.
In five or six of the precincts ir
regularities and illegalities were,
it is also alleged, so flagrant that
the entire vote of such precinct
was held subject to be thrown out
entirely. All the precincts in
question gave Catts large majori
ties and the contemplated action
in that county will, it is claimed,
result greatly in favor of Mr.
Knott. This county gave a larg
er majority than any county in
the state for either candidate, not
withstanding the fact that it cast
a comparatively small vote.
Alachua county: Alleged irreg
ularities in La Crosse precinct
which it is claimed may throw
out the entire vote.
Bay county: second choice
votes, it is claimed, improperly
tallied in some precincts and al
leged irregularities in Lynn Hav
en precinct.
Baker county: Alleged irregu
larities in Sanderson, Macclenny,
Glen St. Mary precincts. Elec
tion officials, it is claimed, deny
inspection of tally books and poll
lists.
Bradford county :Second choice
votes it is alleged, not properly
tallied in number of precincts.
Alleged gross irregularities in
Lake Butler precinct.
Clay county: Alleged error in
precinct No. 5. Will, it is claim
ed give Mr. Knott five additional
votes.
Calhoun county: Alleged irreg
ularities in number of precincts.
Second choice votes, it is claimed,
incorrectly tallied. St Joe pre
cinct, where 59 were qualified,
cast 140 votes. Other precincts
in county, it is alleged, more votes
were cast than were qualified.
Dade county: Alleged irregu
larities in precinct No. 10. Al
leged unofficial ballots found in
precincts 8 and 9.
Duval County Votes
Duval county : Second choice
votes, it is alleged, improperly
counted in five precincts. Re
count will be asked m other pre
cincts in Jacksonville. When the
second choice votes of the five
precincts alleged incorrectly tal
lied are credited it is expected
Mr. Knott will make a substantial
gam.
DeSoto countv: Second choice
votes," it is alleged, improperly
tallied in several small precincts.
Believe that the recount will show
a gain for Mr. Knott.
Jackson countv: Second choice
votes, it is alleged, improperly
tallied. Recount will be asked on
second choice votes in three pre
cincts.
Leon countv: Second choice
votes, it is alleged, improperly

one of these precincts, which
shows a gain for Mr. Knott of five
votes.

ed that there is a sure gain of
from 25 to 30 votes for Mr. Knott.

ond choice votes in three pre
cincts, it is said, show an estimat
ed gain of 7 to 10 votes for Knott.

votes, it is alleged, incorrectly tal
lied in one precinct. Recount
will be asked.
Okaloosa county : Second choice
votes, it is claimed, incorrectly
tallied in four precincts.' Other

counted shows, it is said, gain of
eight votes for Mr. Knott.

tally books and records, .it is al
leged, refused. Irregularities re
ported in number of precincts and
second choice votes improperly
tallied in others.

NEW TROPICAL FRUIT
Anonas Are to be Introduced Into
Dade County
Probably the finest collection of
anonas ever assembled is being
established on the new govern
ment experimental station .north
of Buena Vista, according to Ed
ward Simmonds, scientist in
charge. From all sections of trop
ical South America and the West
Indies the most valuable varieties
of this remarkable species of
fruit have been selected and will
be fruited out here in the hope of
finding some kinds that will
prove the nucleus of a new indus
try for tropical United States in
general and Dade county in par
ticular. To the family of the anonas be
long the familiar custard apple,
Jamacia apple, sweet sop and a-
bout fifty other varieties. The
"mulgoba" of all these apples
will be sought by the scientists,
with possibly many new and bet
ter varieties produced by cross
pol Ionization.
The anona fruits are nearly alt
natives of tropical South Ameri
ca and the islands of this hemi
sphere. They have been proven
to be adaptable to Dade county,
and a large number of trees have
been set out, but as yet the fruit
is used only for home consump
tion, as the grapefruit and avoca
do were twenty yea V ago. The
selection of one or n re varieties
which are best for ting and at
the same time stan transporta
tion well is the ta the station
has set for itself. mi Metrop

The Logic of Events
Objections to the abolishment
of the "poor man's club" seem
to be satisfactorily answered by
the dry states. They prove that
the elimination of the "club is
followed by the elimination of
the poor man.

Germans and Russians Report
Gains on the Eastern Front
London, England Halting af
ter their initial rush, the British
and French are busy consolidat
ing their positions on the held of
the new offensive in the western
front. The Germans have seem
ingly given the French ample
time to accomplish this objective
but the leutonic attacks on the
British lines 'further north have
been heavy and frequent.
Under the flerman pounding
the British, while able to hold the
captured town of La Boisclle, lost
a portion of the defensive posi
tions south of it. Still further
down tho line, however, they cap
tured a wood and some prisoners,
besides war material. More cap
tures of German men and mater
ial including two heavv calibre
batteries are reported by the
French high command.
Meanwhile the Germans are
keeping up their attacks on Ver
dun. Six successive assaults were
launched Monday night upon the
Thiaumont work which the
French recently recaptured but
Paris declares possession of the
entire position was retained. Gen
eral Nivclle s troops made pro
gress near Fumin wood and tho
Damloup works.
On the eastern front Pctrocrad
announces -a severe defeat for the
Austro-Gcrnian forces west of
Lutsk, midway between Dubno
and Sokal, where the Russians
broke the Teuton's resistance
and pushed them towards the
west m the direction of the Gali
cian border.
Heavy forces have beei thrown
into the allied lines south of the
Somme in renewed attempts to
advance, the war office announc
ed today, but all the assaults
were repulsed with heavy losses.
Russians Break German Line
In an attack on the forces of
Prince Leopold, the Russian war
office announces they have brok
en throush two 1 ines of Oprmim
defenses in the region of Baran

2,700 men, eleven guns and a
number of machine guns.
