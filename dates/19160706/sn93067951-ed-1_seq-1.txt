' well as for the social feature of

Then, too, each party accompanied
its declaration of belief in

Another Candidate
For the Legislature?
Manv inquiries have recently
come to this office, concerning
the race for the legjlature, It
would ho difficult for one who
has been in this county only one
year t<? .nterpret these inquiries
with any degree of certainty,
but it does seem that there are
many voters who were anxious
to support the lion. D. S. Mat tieson
for this position who are not
satisfied sinc e his refusal to run.
There are good men already in
the race, men who have previ>usly
been before the people and
have proven their populaiity by
polling votes in large numbers,
but it hus been apparent for
some time that there was room
for another strong man.
It is right here that. Dame
Ivumor comes in with the name
of one of Chesterfield's best ami
most progressive citizens?
Charles L. llunley, esq.
Mr. llunley has not an mm need,
and when asked if he would
do so, he closed his mouth in
imitation of a sphynx, but we
oelieve bis ears remained open.
Though this paper does not pretend
to know who's who in this
game, it. eariy learned to respect
the ability, the energy and the
honesty of Mr. llunley. lie ia
graduate of the University ?>1
South Carolina an !' h.is practiced
law in this town anil county
for four years.
lie comes of old Chester field
county stock and if he should
lecide to submit bis name t<
the voters, we believe he has
good reason to expect a heavy
vote,

It was stated that England had
2,000,000 men, fully equipped
and trained, in preparation for
the supreme ellort to break the

which have resulted in completely
