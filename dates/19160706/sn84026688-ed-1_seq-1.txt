BOY ALONE SAW SEA FIGHT
No One Else In Fleet Witnessed
• Whole Dogger Bank Naval
Battle.
London.—ln a recent visit by Eng
lish newspaper correspondents to the
grand fleet the most interesting point
elicited was the extraordinary sudden
ness of modern sea lighting. There
were Instances of a light beginning be
fore the ventilators were closed down
and the strangest of all, a story of the
buttle of the Dogger hank, where a
hoy was sent out to clean something on
one of the turrets and he was forgotten
in the hurry and the turret closed.
The boy lay flat on the top through
the tight, and he Is one of the few per
sons, officers and men, In the whole af
fair who actually saw the battle, and
tiie only one who could give his whole
attention to the sight, as he had noth

TRACES “SAFETY FIRST” MOVE
Arthur Hunter Says It Followed
Workingmen’s Compensation
Legislation.
Montclair, N. J. —Arthur Hunter,
president of the Actuarial Society of
America, told the Montclair Heights
Community club that the "safety llrst”
movement was a sequel to the adop
tion of workingmen’s compensation
laws.
He said there used to be a saying
that In the erection of large buildings
it took “one life for every story.” He
pointed out that under the compensa
tion act the Woolworth building lit
New York was erected without a fatal
ity.
Unemployment Insurance, Mr. Hunt
er held, should be distributed to men
Justly out of work, but only enough
should he paid to “keep the wolf from
the door" in order to prevent people
from dodging employment.
Substitute for Leather.
“I see a substitute for sole leather

CHIVALRY IN WAR
RECORD IS NOV ALL ONE OF
DEATH AND PAIN,
Stories That Come From the Trenches
In Europe Recall Similar Instances
Of Gallant Deeds by American
Revolutionary Soldiers.
A gallant foe respects the courage
of his enemy. From the fighting line
In France came lately the story how
a German officer, under suspicion of
having improperly surrendered a for
tified angle of the German trenches
that was shortly after retaken by his
compatriots, was only saved from pun
ishment and the ruin of bis career by
a Frenchman wffom he had severely
wounded. The French soldier, on his
way to a hospital prison, learned by
chance of the accusation, and he in
sisted, at the cost of frightful pain
and exhaustion —for his wound waa
In the cheek and jaw—upon dictating
the testimony that cleared the man
who had nearly killed him and had
dishgured him for life.
A notable instance of a soldier’s
chivalrous defense of his enemy's rep
utation occurs In the history of our
own country, as an American historian
has pointed out.
John Callender, an artillery captain
at the battle of Bunker Hill, was
caught by General Putnam In the very
act of leaving his post, and was or
dered buck under pain of being shot.
There was no time to listen to ex
planation oi remonstrance. When
the fight was over Callender’s state
ment that his pieces bad become
jammed, and that he was withdrawing
them to cover for repairs would prob
ably have been accepted bad it not
been also unfortunately true that the
men under tis command bad all bolt
ed, shamelessly abandoning the guns.
At least, so It appeared; although the
fact was that they bad broken away,
not to tty, but to fight In the ranks
with muskets snatched from the dying
and dead. But the court-martial that
tried the unhappy captain cashiered
him for cowardice.
At once Callender did a brave
thing; braver than fighting, although
it meant fighting, too. Deprived of
his commission, he re-enllsted as a
private; and his comrades, If any
shunned him at first, soon learned to
believe In his Innocence. It was to
a British officer, however, that he
owed bis complete vindication. In
the course of a losing battle, Callen
der, fighting with desperate courage,
continued to load and fire his guu af
ter all bis officers wore killed and his
companions had retreated. When his
ammunition was gone ho mounted as
tride the gun, resolved that his death
at his post should give the lie to bis
unjust condemnation. His conduct so
aroused the admiration of the British
officer opposed to him that be ordered
his men not to fire on the solitary, un
armed hero, hut to close In and cap
ture him. Then learning his story, he
refused even to hold him prisoner,
but dismissed him without exchange,
bearing a letter to General Washing
ton that testified to his courage.
Washington joyfully restored his
commission and ordered his sentence
erased from the records—Youth’s
Companion.
Elephants and Camels Drill,
Elephants and camqls, carrying two
machine-gun sections of the Twenty
eight company of the United States
marine corps quartered at the exposi
tion at San Diego, Cal., took part in ex
perimental maneuvers and quickly
demonstrated the feasibility of their
use in actual warfare conditions such
as now obtain in Mexico.
Mounting one operator and tripod
machine gun to an elephant, attended
by several United States marines on
foot, the elephants dirplayed surpris
ing agility In traversing over rough
ground and wheeling into proper posi
tion for firing. The elephants, when
ordered to lie down, made a perfect
breastworks, behind which the ma
rines were enabled in 30 seconds to
employ an effective machine-gun lire.
Both elephants and camels would
prove useful In an extended campaign,
such as the present one In Mexico, an
official declared, for both can carry
large loads and can go long distances
without water. Elephants are more
nervous under lire than camels; but
With proper training they can be cured
of guushyness.
Keeping It From the Public.
One night during the run of Under
Cover at the Cort theater In New
York, William Courtenay, who la sup
posed to toss a string of pearls to bis
pal waiting beneath the window, made
a wild pitch, and the heavy Jewels
went into the audience and bit a man,
seated near the front, in the forehead,
cutting bis skin deeply, and causing
him to bleed profusely. The man was
taken to a retiring room, and his
wound dressed, and the press repre
sentative bent every effort, and suc
cessfully, to keep the story from the
papers. Its publication would not have
encouraged timid persons to occupy
front row seats and expose themselves
to the chance of being struck in the
eye with smuggled pearls.
Did Well With His Talent.
An Atlanta pastor, who has run
shoestring of SIOO into such real
money as $30,000 by cotton specula
tions, and who will now build a trade
school for poor children, has admit
tedly manipulated bis talent with all
the adroitness and effect one could
possibly wish.

1A Woman’s
M Past |[|
Jte By GEORGE MUNSON
(Copyright, 1916, by W, Q. Chapman.)
The boy looked at the beautiful
woman upon the sofa before him,
seated resplendent in her evening
gown, and his heart swelled with ela
tion. It was the great moment in a
boy's life; Charles Ames had won the
love of Della Gray.
And that he was twenty four and
she thirty did not move him from his
resolution to hold to her promised
word and never let her go.
The pursuit had been a lung one.
At first she had laughed at him, she
had striven bard in the net, but at
twenty-four one has the resolute ardor
of youth; and at last she knew that
there was no way of escape for her.
She loved as she had never loved In
all her checkered life before.
She promised to be Ills wife, and
knew at the same time that the
dream was Impossible. What Vould
Hardwick Ames suy when lie learned
that his missions were to become the
property of an adventuress?
“Till death!” said the boy as he
kissed her at parting, in the way boys
■peak.
Delia Gray was not surprised to
receive a visit from the millionaire
the following afternoon. It waa only
half a mile from bis mansion across
the park to her flat, though a whole
world separated them.
Della was pleasantly surprised at
ths appearance of her visitor. She
She Began to Pack.
had pictured Hardwick Ames as a dif
ferent sort of man, not the polished
gentleman who stood before her.
"Won’t you sit down, Mr. Ames?”
she asked nervously.
He took his seat near her, and
studied her Intently. “How old are
you. Miss Gray?" he asked abruptly.
“Thirty," she answered, feeling that
In the coming battle of wits lies were
handicaps.
"And my son has known you?"
"Two months." She twined her slim
fingers nervously. “I refused him
many times."
"Yes. You do not work, I believe?"
"I have a small competence.”
"From your late husband?"
"Yes," she answered defiantly. “I
took my maiden name again? Many
divorced women do that."
"And Charles —my son—knows all
this, of course? I see he does. And
that you were not the injured party?”
"Yes, he knows everything," she
cried. “Have you men, you Immac
ulate men of the world, no understand
ing of what life may sometimes do 1
to a woman who trusts It too blindly?" i
He twisted his mouth to hide the
sense of the theatrical In her words, !
“Yes," he said quietly. “I had no de
sire to harry you. Out my son la |
twenty-four"
She twined her fingers ceaselessly, :
"I have been through all that with
him. He wants to marry me."
"And you are willing to marry him
and ruin him? You know that a boy
Of twenty-four, for all his promises,
will change. You know there will
come a time when he will tire of you.
Forgive mo If I speak brutally. Miss
Qray, but I speak from a knowledge
of the world.”
"1 do not resent your speech,” she
answered. ‘‘Time and again I told
him It was foolish, that It could come
to nothing: but he Insisted."
“And you accepted him. Please re
member that. You accepted him.
knowing that his life would be spoiled.
A man may come out of these affairs
better than a woman, but still —the
fact remains that you propose to take
the unstained life of a boy and mold
It—yes, mold It to that of ypur owp.’
“How mold?” she demanded sharp
ly.
"A woman of thirty molds a man of
twenty-four. You will drag—er—”
“Drag him down," she said bitterly.
"Don’t hesitate to be as frank with
me as before. Yes. I will drag him
down to my level."
"A woman of your experiences must
Inevitably drag down a youth with
none. I do not mean to reproach you.
But now let us come to business. Mar
riage with Charles —my son —and of
course he will remain my son in spite
of It —will mean a lucrative—er—ln
vestment.”
"Go on.”
“On the other hand you may not
marry him. He loves his mother, and
his mother is probably on her knees
before him at this moment, pleading
xvlth him. You may never get the
Ames inheritance. At least, his moth
er and I will fight against you with
all our power. Now, my dear Mist
Gray, when you have reached my age
—lf women ever do acknowledge fifty
five —you will realize that the great
factor of successful life Is compro
mise. I will give you a hundred thou
sand dollars to give up my sou for
ever and leave town tonight.”
The blood rushed Into Delia’s
cheeks. For ail his smooth words,
then, he had mistaken her for a com
mon adventuress for money, her who
had never sought anything but love,
and had always failed to find It.
At that moment she heard a light
step in the hall without. It was so
light that the millionaire, who was
absorbed in-signing his name to the
check which he had already with
drawn from his pocket, failed to de
tect it. The woman's heart leaped up.
It was Charles—her lover—whom she
loved better than all the world. A
surge of anger swept over her.
But the father’s words had sunk in
deep. She had Indeed often thought
of what the future might bring to
them. She had begun to realize that
love may not be captured, that he is
elusive to those who seek him and
only comes to those whose lives are
set in other molds than hers.
A few years with Charles, and, as
the father had said, the end would
come. At thirty-five he would be in
the prime of life; she, at forty-ono,
a middle-aged woman.
And the spell of the past was on
her, and she knew that she, who had
loved in vain, could never hope to
make this new love hers.
She heard the footstep stop at the
door, which was Imperceptibly open.
Charles had seen his father, or heard
his voice, and hesitated, not knowing
what course to take.
And in that moment the impulse of
renunciation came to the woman.
"Yea, If your cheek Is good I will
accept It," she said brazenly, stretch
ing out her hand to Hardwick's, to re
ceive the paper.
“It Is quite good,' said the father
complacently. "You agree, then, to
leave town tonight in return for a
hundred thousand dollars, and never
to see my son again? Such an agree
ment is, of course, not valid in law,
but—well, you would find it hard to
break it, even if you wished to. which
I do not believe."
"I shall leave tonight," said Delia
mechanically. And she heard the
quick gasp behind the door and then
the sharp sounds of retiring footsteps.
"Who's that?” cried the father
quickly.
"The janitor, I suppose,” said Delia,
Indifferently.
He rose. “Qoodby, then," he said
with quiet triumph. "I am glad wa
settled that so sensibly. And if ever
I can be at your service—"
He was gone, and Delia seized the
check and tore It wildly Into a hun
dred pieces. Then, with flushed
cheeks and tearless eyes, she began
to pack.
BRIEF FOR OSAGE ORANGE
Many Uses That Are Made of a Com
mon and Deservedly Popular
American Plant.
A Missouri correspondent of th
Youth’s Companion comes loyally to
the defense of the Osage orange,
which we permitted ourselves to
speak of as a wood that has no par
ticular value beyond its use as a dye
stuff.
The Osage orange, he says, Is a
favorite hedge plant in the mlddlq
West, because it grows very quickly,
endures close trimming, and forms a
tough, efficient barrier, when used for
fencing. In or out of the ground
It is remarkably durable, and Osage
fence posts sell at high prices. Farth
er south than Missouri It grows tall
enough to be used for telegraph and
telephone poles.
In the extreme south where In the
vernacular It is known as “bow dock"
(apparently a contraction ’of boia
d are) It Is much used In the manufac
ture of cart and wagon wheels. The
wood is tough and hard, and it con
tracts and expands very little when
exposed to the extremes of flood or
drought.
As a fuel Osage wood has few
equals, and live stock often eat its
fruit, the hedge orange or hedge
apple.
Planted In groves, the tree grows
rapidly and appears to be absolutely
free from disease. The heart wood,
a brilliant yellow color, is beautiful
both in color and grain; used for in
terior finish, it will take a high polish.
The characteristics that make its
enemies abuse the Osage are the very
qualities that recommend It to ita
friends. The seasoned wood la so
hard that you can hardly drive a nail
or a fencp staple Into It. The dense
mass of tough branches and needle
pointed thorns make a line fence, but
they Irritate the men who must attack
a neglected, overgrown hedge. The
very sturdiness and hardiness that
enable the Osage orange hedge to en
dure rough treatment and to bold Its
own against the assaults of live stock
are likely to annoy the man who
wishes to change his fence lines and
must subdue a string of hedge to do
so.
PUT INTEREST IN THE WORK
Some Hints for Those Who Would
Outgrow Self-Consciousness
In Public.
If you are self-conscious do not al
low yourself to get the Idea that you
are different from other people. Prac
tically every one who appears In pub
lic work has the same experience of
belug self-conscious at some time in
bis career, William E. Towne writes
in the Nautilus.
You will find the most direct cure Is
to get so interested in your work. In
your speaking, singing or acting, that
you forget the audience. Whenever,
you feel nervous just before a public
appearance, turn your thought to your
work. Displace the fear and worry
thought with a thought of Interest In
your work. Learn to abandon your
self to the part you are to play until
you have crowded out the fear
thoughts and driven them entirely
from your mind.
Slow rhythmic breathing will in
variably help you Hold the breath just
an Instant before you expel It. Af
firmation and prayer will help, in pro
portion as you have faith in them and
apply them with feeling. Physical re
laxing exercises just before a public
appearance will also help Mrs Annie
Payson Call lias written some very
practical books on relaxation and poise
that would help in this matter.
Do everything deliberately and slow
ly Just previous to the time you appea?
before your audience. Worry is close
ly allied to the feeling of hurry. Keep
your mind occupied so that you will
not get to feeling hurried and panicky.
Make all your physical movements
and your breathing deliberate. This
will help you to control your mind
If your thought is distracted by ap
plause during the delivery of your lines
bring your thought right back to your
work and abandon yourself to your
part as If the audience did not exist.
Remember, the one thing to aim at
Is to displace the worry thoughts,
crowd them out, by keeping the mind
occupied with your work. The psy
cbologlsts say that the best way to
break up a train of thought Is to dis
place It with another train. You will
have to put forth some effort of will
at first, but If you “wane In” each time
with the determination to go through
with It anyhow, doing the best ycq
can, you will soon find It Is a little
easier to “let go,” and the worry and
tension will begin to felax.
These methods are equally good for
any kind of bashfulness or self-con
sclousuess.
Midway Island.
Midway Is the name of a small coral
Island in the Pacific ocean which is
made to bear Its part in man’s scheme
of things us a relay station of the
Commercial Pacific Cable company
At the beginning It was Just about
large enough for the purpose to which
It is put, but U Is growing and ha;
bright prospects. Every three months
schooner la sent to Midway with
food and other supplies for the cable
operators. Whatever space there ia
in the ship not required fur supplies
is filled up with the native soil ol
Hawaii, where the vessel Is outfitted,
and the earth is dumped where it wli)
do the most good toward rjunding out
the periphery of Midway. This pro.
cess has been going on so long and
successfully that there Is now a mead
ow almost ezteusive enough to afford
pasturage (or a cow. Not all of the
facta herein set forth might be read
ily accepted as such, but they are
rendered doubtproof by publication
in "Commercial Reports,” which, as
all know, has the backing and sanc
tion of federal government.
New York Nation's Beauty Market.
In the beautiful women stage New
York leads the world. Such Is the dic
tum of Florenz Zlegfeld, Jr., master
impresario of the musical stage, who
Is a keen Judge of charming feminity.
It la ro art with him—an art which has
made his productions famous. ”1 am
not speaking at random when I say
that the capitals of Europe cannot pro
duce anything to compare with the
American beauty of the stage," says
Mr. Zlegfeld. "In my career 1 have
probably passed Judgment on 2 .000
young women, and not more than one
In 35 was chosen. The type I demand
must not be more than 5 feet 1 in
height, beautiful In face, form and
manner, possessed of youth, g: ace,
soul, personality, and she must not bo
more than twenty-five years old. The
showgirl type Is a type that has
passed. The girl of Irish extraction Is
the Ideal, chorus girl. The thin girl,
the fat girl, the wax-figure girl Is not
desired. The American chorus girl is
the most beautiful, most finished type
In the world. And New York Is the
beauty market of the nation.”
Ibsen’s “Ghosts” Offended.
Twenty-five years ago there took
place the first performance in Eng and
of Ibsen’s “Ghosts,” remarks the Lon
don Times.
The play formed the opening pro
duction of the Independent theater,
founded by J. T. Orein, who recalls
that the occasion elicited no less than
500 articles, mostly vituperating Ib
sen, while some families closed their
doors against Mr. Orein on the ground
that he had produced an Immoral play.
Another storm was raised by Zola’s
"Therese Raquln,” the second play of
the society—whose first members in
cluded George Meredith, Thomas
Hardy, Sir Arthur Sullivan and Henry
Arthur Jones.
One of the greatest successes of
the Independent theater occurred In
1893, when Mr. Grain obtained from
Bernard Shaw the manuscript of bis
flrat play. “Widowers’ Houses.”

NOT YET IN DISCARD
HORSE STILL A QUANTITY TO BB
RECKONED WITH.
Figures Show That Development of
the Automobile Has by No Means
Done Away With Man’s Always
Faithful Servant.
The horse still Is king. The advent
of autos has pushed him off some of
the city streets as a pleasure horse,
but his family is larger today than It
was 26 years ago, when automobiles
were unknown. Statistics compiled by
government bureaus show that 85 per
cent of transportation throughout the
United States is done by the horse.
Discussing the situation, Irving Par
menter, secretary of the New York
State Association of Hersemen, said:
"The reports of the federal department
of agriculture show 21,000,000 horses
on the farms of the United States at
the present time against 14,000,000 in
1890. The value of the horses on the
farms alone is estimated at more than
$2,000,000,000. All the automobiles in
the United States are rated at $1,260,-
ooorooo.
"The Commercial Car Journal ad
mits that government statistics show
85 per cent of the nation’s transporta
tion is done by horses.
"While it is true that the estimated
number of horses in this state has
shrunk 6,000 in the past year, due
probably to war exports, farm horses
have increased, according to federal
figures, from 591,008 as shown by the
1910 census, to 609,000. In 1909 the
value of 710,000 horses on New York
farms was placed at 180,940,000. To
day 609,000 animals are valued at $84,-
851,000.
"More horses are trucking on New
York's streets today than two years
ago.
"Despite the importance of the horse
industry those Interested in it failed to
organize until the horsemen were the
only class not represented by some
amalgamation. As a result their inter
ests were neglected. Highways were
built unfit for a horse to travel; no
proper provisions regulating stallions
in service were made, and breeding
has declined until military and police
authorities have difficulty securing re
mounts, and fire departments recom
mend motor tractors because of the
scarcity and cost of high grade horses.
"Now the horsemen have organized,
representing the farms, the road
drivers, the trucksters, the track—
every branch of the horse Industry,
united for mutual protection, and sup

Horsemen has no dispute with the mo
torists. Wo desire to co-operate with
the automebile organizations, for onr
aims are one. Unquestionably a new
era is upon us.
“As the cities put the slow moving
vehicles to the curb, so should the
state's trunk roads provide a Smooth
center for faster travel, and upon
either flank there should be drives for
horses, of a surface suitable for their
requirements. The creation of such
drives Is one of our alms. The asso
ciation hopes, also, to revive breeding,
and to see that the rights of the horse
men are supported everywhere.”
Curiosities of Antitoxins.
One of the latest discoveries 5n the
field of antitoxins has been given the
name of anaphylaxis; It was made dur
ing experiments in Injecting Into a dog
minute doses of a poison secreted by
sea anemones. The first dose produced
very little effect on the dog; It was fol
lowed three weeks later by a similar
dose. The experimenter found to his
surprise that the second dose was
fatal; the first dose had rendered the
animal much more, Instead of less,
sensitive to the poison. It was found
later that If an injection Into an ani
mal of even so harmless a substance
as white of egg is followed after three
weeks by a second Injection, the re
sult Is fatal; but if the first Injection
is followed by further doses at inter
vals of a week there is no bad result.
The cause of this curious fact la not
known; but since It was discovered
medical men have been very careful
not to allow too long an Interval to
elapse between two doses of any al
buminous compound.—Sir William
Ramsay, In Youth’s Companion.
Will Use Old Tin Cans.
Among the recent patents filed in
England is the process for removing
the solder, tin and chemicals from
scrap aud galvanized articles and for
utilizing the base metals. The inven
tor Is a South Wales tinplate worker,
who has already secured contracts
from several municipalities for treat
ing down refuse such as tin cans, con
tainers and similar metallic waste
products.
Formerly largo quantities of old tins
were taken by continental dealers,
practically at the cost of carriage, to
be utilized In manufacturing cheap ar
ticles such as toy soldiers, novelties,
mechanical toys, and a large assort
ment of nondescript articles usually
found in penny bazaars, etc. The usual
process in manufacturing such goods
only necessitated a simple cutting or
stamping and a light coating of enamel
or paint.
Playing Safe.
“I’m going to take my vacation early
this year.”
“What's the idea?”
"By the time the firm finds out how
easily they can get along without
me the other fellows will be taking
their vacations and my Job will be
safe until the summer is over any
way.'
