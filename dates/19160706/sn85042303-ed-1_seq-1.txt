SHARP IS IN CHICAGO
CONSULTING ARCHITECTS
J. R. Sharp was to have been here
early this week to take up the hotel
matter with the stockholders, but at
the last moment he was called to
Chicago to confer with the architects
and nothing further will be done until
after his return to Ardmore. Work
on the hotel, it is assured, will start
before many days. The plans and
details of the building are still in the
hands of the architects, and until
these are all finished and accepted,
nothing will be attempted. The hotel
will be well under way and perhaps
ready for occupancy before the first
of the coming year.

French Resume Advance North of Somme and Capture German
Second Positions there, Although Last Night was Gen
erally Quiet One British Troops Have Made Another
"Slight Advance and Captured a Number of Prisoners,"
British War Office Announces, Following Raids into Ger
man First Line South of Labasse Canal, which Raid was
Preceded by Discharge of Gas and Smoke Berlin Claims
Repulse of French Attacks southwest of Fort Vaux in Ver
dun District German Report Says French Suffered
Serious Losses in Unssuccessful Attack on Narrow Front in
the Aisne District South of Ville aux Bois.
The Anglo-French offensive in Pic
ardy has entered another day of sub
stantial progress, the outstanding fea
tures being a resumption of the
French advance north of Somme and
the capture of the second German po
sitions there.
Although the night was generally
quiet, according to today's French of
ficial statement, the French consider
the capture of Hem of considerable
importance, for it commands the pass
age of the river to Feuilleres, already
in their hands. Its possession also
assures a direct bond between the
corps on either side of the stream.
The British have iade another
"slight advance" and captured a num
ber of prisoners, the British war of
fice announced today. This followed
raids into the German first line south
of the Labassee canal, after the dis
charge of gas and smoke.
The attempts made by the French
yesterday to advance southwest of
Fort Vaux in Verdun were repulsed,
says a Berlin statement. Similar ef
forts to recapture Damloup Hill were
unsuccessful. The French made an
attack on a narrow front in the Aisne
district south of Ville Aux Bois, which
was unsuccessful and cost the French
serious losses.
Between Ancre Brook and Somme
and south of the river, says today's
official German statement, the fight
ing continues. Minor progress was
made by the British near Thiepval,
which was balanced by counter at
tacks. Farther south the British se
cured a firm foothold in an advanced
trench.
Allies Nearlng Peronne.
Palis, July 6. The French yester
day carried by assault the second
German lines on a front of more than
one mile from the ciery-Maricourt
road to the Somme river and have
I
also taken the village of Hem in the
same district. The full force of the
French offensive is now being exert
ed on both sides of the Somme, but
principally southward, where the
French are now in the outskirts of
Peronne, the great railway center,
which was the first objective in their
attempt to cut the German communi
cations. Sermont farm, taken yester
day, is only two miles from Peronne,
and adjoins its suburban houses. That
the Germans appreciate the import
ance of Peronne is indicated in their
fierce counter-attack on Bellot-en-Senterre,
which they temporarily held
but was later retaken by the French.
