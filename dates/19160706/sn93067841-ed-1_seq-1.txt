ENTHUSIASTIC MEETING WIT
THAT END IN VIEW HELD
IN CHARLESTON.
In response to an invitation to i
present at a meeting of the dire
.tore of the Charleston Chamber <
v- .ffiytfmerce held in that city Mond?
for the consideration of the propo
td route of the new highway b
tween Charleston and Columbia Sei
. ator E C Epps and Mr W F Tollt
attended as representatives fro
the local board of trade. Thei
was considerable interest manifes
d in the project and it really lool
as if the people on the other side <
the Santee, who will be affectei
mean business and are ready to c
perate with the people of Charle
ton in the construction of the roa<
It was plainly evident that tl
directors of the Charleston Chamb<
f Commerce and the represent
tives attending the meeting fro
Monck's Corner were desirous <
having the route cross the Sanb
river at Murry's ferry and pass (
through Kingstree.
The following account of the mee
ing is taken from the News ar
, Courier of Tuesday:
"At a meeting of the board of c
hf* rectors of the Chamber of Cor
^ merce yesterday morning to decit
upon the route to be improved b
p tween Charleston and Columbia, tl

recommending that passing throup

ment of the movement. Some two
months ago, he said, it had come to ]
! the attention of menjbers of the i
' board that both of the commonly- i
H used roads between Charleston and i
Columbia were all but impassable in !
wet weather. A sub-committee had i
then been appointed to look into the i
possibility of improving the old |
c
State highway, which passes through '
3 Holly Hill. It had met with such ]
iy indifference from the people of that i
'9* I
I section of Berkeley county through j <
6- I
which the highway runs, however, <
n that it had been forced to look else- <
* y 1
! where for a route. Delegates from ]
m I Monck'9 Corner had then come to <
re'
j the committee, advocating the new 1
\ route and promising enthusiastic co- i
(S
^ operation. The new line, known as I
^ i the Congaree road, had accordingly
' j been chosen. 1
?*i "Dr Kershaw Fishbume, speaking '
s*
for the delegates from Monck's i
Corner, said that the present under- I
ie taking should be divorced absolute- 1
2r ly from politics, so that the people 1
ft*
could be sure that all the money ap- '
propriated would be spent upon th? '
road. He favored the administra- '
^! tion of the funds by a commission. 1
m i The law allows, he said, the levying 1
of a two-mill tax for a period of i
* [ two years upon the property of perid
I sons living in the parishes through i
1; - which a road runs, provided the i
property-holders' consent can be se- t
"" cured. This would provide, in the
case of that part of the new route I
6 passing through Berkeley county, a i
10
sum of six thousand dollars a year, '
e' and he is sure that the levy would
rn
' I pass. In addition to this, a mini- i
mum of about three and possibly I
m
' five or six thousand dollars could ]
^ almost certainly be secured by pri- J
*:vate subscription. This, with the 1
P i amount subscribed by the Charles- I
'3
i ton Chamber, would bring the total
n up to between sixteen and twenty
6S
thousand dollars.
r' "The delegates from Holly Hill reper
resented that they had been ignorant ,
^ of the agitation for a better road,
^ and asked that they be given time
to find out whether the people of
that section of Berkeley county would 1
not support the improvement of the
ir 1
j old State highway before the board J
l I chnnM tnkp definite action favoring '
p- the other route. '

"The supporters of the Congaree
road brought out that the cost of
improving would be much less than
in the case of the State road, that
it passed through a more populous
section of the coastal plain, and that
it passes in a short distance of Murray's
ferry across the Santee, improvement
of the roads near which
would open up to Charleston the

:ent counties. Mr Philip H Gadsien
pointed out that acceptance of
Dne route did not by any means imply
rejection of the other, and that
Charleston would be certainly glad
to help in improving the State road
f the persons along it seemed interested.
"Commissioner E J Watson was
leartily in favor of the new route.
Hs assured the board that a good
road through the coastal plain would
be of immense advantage to Charleston,
and stressed particularly the
value to the city of communication
with the territory across the Santee.
Ferries on important highways,
he said, had never proved satisfactory;
and he advised the board
to take steps toward the erection of
a bridge at Murray's ferry.
"A joint committee was formed
to take charge of the work on the
aew route, and, in view of the assistance
promised by the citizens of
Monck's Corner and elsewhere, the
board went on record as endorsing
the new route for the State highway."
The meeting was assured by Senator
Epps that the people of Williamsburg
were heartily in favor of the
route passing through their county
and in his opinion would do their
Pull share toward the?buiiding of a
bridge across the Santee at Murray's
ferry.
| LATEST WAR SUMMARY. ^
Rritish and French troops, thrown
forward in a great offensive against
the German lines on both sides of
the River Somme, 60 miles north of
Paris, have penetrated at one point
to a depth of five miles; taken several
villages and captured a labyrinth
of trenches extending to a
depth of l.OCOyards on a front of
3even miles.
The drive, the most spectacular in
this region since the British captured
Loos last September, began Saturday
morning after the German
trenches had been subjected to a
bail of shells from guns of every
ealibre for days. Progress has been
reported along the entire front of
about 25 miles.
The greatest success gained by
the British was on the right. In
the centre they captured what are j
designated in the official report as!
'4 ?wC?%fa '' olnn/? o ^ronf
many iliuijk ^juuhs, aiuu^ c* uvuk
pf four miles. But north of the
A.ncre valley to Gommecourt powerful
counterattacks by the Germans
lave resulted in forcing the British
back from various sections of the
ground gained in their first onslaughts.
The town of Albert was the starting
point of one of the fiercest fights,
:he British advancing from east of
town to Montauban, more than five
miles away. Besides Montauban and
Serre, the villages of Hebutems, La
Boiaselle and Mametz have been
;aptured. Two thousand German
prisoners have passed through the
British collecting stations.
In co-operation with the British
the French initiated a strong: otfenlive.
South of the Somme they captured
four villages, and north of
that river they established themselves
in the neighborhood of Harde:ourt
and Curlu. The number of
German prisoners taken by the
French had reached 3,500 up to the
time of the sending of the last official
report.
The capture of the famous Thiau%
mont work on the Verdun front by
the French also has been effected. R
This important strategic point has
changed hands several times and i
around it probably thousands of j
men have fallen. On the left bank s<
of the Meuse, the fighting is most ^
intense around Hill 204, Le Mort ^
Homme and Avocourt. c
In the Trentino the Italians continue
to advance along the entire ^
Pysina line and the Arsena valley. 8
Artillery bombardments mark the ^
action on the rest of the AustroA
Italian front. rWhile
the Russians report progress ^
south of the Dniester river, in Galicia, *
the Austro-Germans claim the capture
of Russian works west and * '
northwest of Lutzsk, especially in ^
the vicinity of Sokul, Volhynia. P
Maintaining their drive against a
the Austrians in Galicia in the region
of Kolomea, the Russians have cap- c
tured many villages. Northwest of p
Kimpolung, Bukowina. the Russians w
already are in the mountains and 31
they report the seizure of several
strong positions. Attacks of Ger- e
man troops in the region of the Lipa ^
river were repulsed with heavy ^
losses, Petrograd asserts. 0
The German troops under Gen von ^
Linsengen have taken Russian posi- ^
t;
tions west of Kolki and southwest of v
Sokul. Fighting is in progress south- ^
west of Lutzsk. p
Gen von Linsengen's forces since N
July 16 hare captured 26 officers and
1,165 men. Petrograd reports the v
number of prisoners taken from a
June 4 to June 30, inclusive, as h
217,000 officers and men.

CARRANZA'S REPLY ^
CONCILIATORY, |
WASHINGTON OFFICIALS FEEL
THAT BREAK WITH MEXICO
HAS BEEN AVERTED.
Washington, Jul} 4:?General Carranza's
reply to the demands af the
United States reached the Mexican
embassy here today ana will be delivered
to Secretary Lansing tomorfj
row. If it is correctly described by
persons close to the embassy, it is
conciliatory in lartguage and tone
and designed to offer a basis for
amicable adjustment of difficulties
between the two governments.
As all Washington was celebrating
the Fourth of July, Eliseo Arredondo,
the Mexican ambassador-designate,
made no attempt to seek an
immediate engagement to present
the communication. Instead he di
*
rected an embassy employee to give
out such information as it was deemed
advisable to make public in adj
vance of delivery of the note and
[ then, with members of his staff, left
1 Washington to spend the day at a
summer resort.
Secretary Lansing was told of the
I arrival of the reply by newspaper .
I correspondents. He seemed gratified
at the description of its content*
j but withheld formal comment.
In spite of the reserve pending
study of the text of the note, the
general feeling here was that the
crisis which had been only a step
1 from actual war had passed. If the
unofficial version of the reply is
borne out there undoubtedly will be
! a resumption of friendly diplomatic
| negotiations, and in the absence of
| further serious border raids sr un!
warranted attacks upon American
j troops, there will be little danger of
!a break.
According to the information avail!
able, the note renews assurances that
j adequate forces of the de facto goyi
ommpnt. are enzazed in suppressing
brigandage in northern Mexico and
i protecting the international line; adJ
j
mits that a serious situation exists
i but again suggests that the presence
i of American troops aggravate rather
than helps matters; and paves the
way for resumption of discussions
