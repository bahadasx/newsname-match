iness.
A motion was made that the chair
appoint a committee of three each on
permanent organization, resolutions
and to name delegates to the state
convention at Des Moines July 12th.
There was objection to the committee
to name delegates consisting of only
three members, as there was some
what of a controversy on, an effort
being made by the republican post
master of Leon to secure a delegation
which would indorse Dr. Reynolds
as committeeman from this district.
A roll call was demanded and the del
egates voted to have the committee
to select delegates consist of a mem

this committee resultc in the follow

A motion then prevailed that the
convention adjourn until 1:30 p. m.
Upon reconvening in the afternoon,
the committee on permanent organi
zation reported recommending that
the temporary organization be made
permanent and the report was adopt
ed.
The committee on resolutions re
ported the following, in which the
practice of appointing non-resident
or republicans to offices of public
trust (referring to such appointments
as the postmaster at Leon) was de
nounced in strong language, and the
delegates to the state convention in
structed to oppose by all honorable
means the selection to any position of
trust any man guilty of such prac
tice, (evidently referring to Doc Rey
nolds and his indorsement of the
Leon postmaster.) and the resolutions
were adopted without a single dis
senting vote:
The democratic delegates of De
catur county in convention assem
bled, unqualifiedly indorse the ad
ministration of President Woodrow
Wilson and the democratic members
of congress for the patriotism, wis
dom and devotion to the public wel
fare shown by them.
We reaffirm the Jeffersonian the
ory, equal and exact justice to all
men, and special privileges to none.
We believe that the party in power
has the right and it is its duty to fill
the appointive offices with men who
are faithful to their party, and we
condemn the practice of appointing
non-residents or republicans to offices
of public trust as an outrage, ihat
should relegate to political obscurity,
all parties responsible for such ap
pointments. We hereby instruct our
delegates to the state convention to
oppose by all honorable means the
election to any position of trust any
man guilty of such practice as named
above.
We are espcially proud of the dem
ocratic party for things accomplish
ed. The revision of the tariff in
placing on tne free list, many articles
that were sheltered by the trusts, re
ducing the tariff on many other ar
ticles of necessity in the interest of
the common people of this country.
The Federal Reserve Act that made
it next to impossible for the tariff
barons to bring on a money ptfnic at
any time they so desired. In the
passing, legalizing, vitalizing the in
come tax iaw which we regard as the
most just form of taxation that could
possibly be devised, In compelling the
rich to pay a just proportion of taxa
tion.
In the election of United States
senators by direct vote, in the estab
lishment of a Federal Trade Commis
sion, and a non-partisan tariff com
mission, in building up a merchant
marine, in preparing for national de
fense, in the passing, and enlarging
of parcel post system that prevents
the enormous profits and extortion
heretofore made by express compan
ies and also in the efforts to establish
a rural credit system whereby the
farmers can obtain long time loans
at a low rate of interest, and in the
repeal of the coast-wise shipping bill.
We firmly believe the democratic
&<• ji.i/V.':'-
«,
THE
party in the last three years has en
acted more laws for the benefit of the
common people of this country than
were enacted by the republican par
ty in the last thirty years of its exist
ence.
We especially commend the presi
dent in his efforts to maintain peace
with honor.
We hereby ratify and affirm the
principles of the democratic party as
enunciated, in its national platform
of 1912, and in the national platform
of 1916. are especially proud of
the fact that during the past three
years the people of the United States
have been more prosperous than ever
before and that the prosperity has in
a large measure grown out of the
laws enacted by the democratic par
ty.
We hereby, unqualifiedly inddrse
the administration of President
Woodrow Wilson and especially for
the extraordinary wisdom shown' by
him in every matter arising in our
foreign relations with nations now at
war, and being absolutely certain
that the welfare and prosperity and
honor of our country will be promot
ed and maintained by a continuance
in power of a democratic president
and congress. We hereby pledge our
active and energetic support to the
election of Woodrow Wilson as
President of the United States, at the
general election to be held in No
vember, 191G.
And also to the election of our
congressional, state and county ticket.
The committee to sekct delegates
to the state convention reported the
following as delegates, and their se
lection was ratified by the unanimous
vote of the convention:
M. C. Freestone, Decatur J. L.
Still, Garaen Grove W. H. Young,
Richland F. W. Newcomb, Fayette
V. R. McGinnis, Leon M. F. Thomp
son, Long Creek Cherles R. Piercy,
Bloomington: A. M. Pryor, Leon
Frank Cox, Eden.
There was only one vacancy on the
county ticket to be filled, there being
no candidate before the voters at the
primary for the office of coroner, and
on motion the secretary was instruct
ed to cast the unanimous vote of the
delegates for Dr. J. B. Horner, of La
moni, as the democratic candidate
for coroner to sit upon the remains of
the republican party in November.
On motion the convention then ad
journed.
Democratic County Central Commit
tee Organized.
Immediately after the close of the
county convention the precinct com
mitteemen met for the purpose of or
ganizing the new committee. M. F.
Springer, of Center(township, was se
lected as chairman and J. L. Still of
Garden Grove, re-elected as secretary,
Dr. F. A. Bowman, of Leon, who has
served as county chairman for the
past four years, was not a candidate
for the position this year. The com
mittee extended a vote of thanks to
Dr. Bowman for the splendid work
he has done, expressing their appre
ciation of his untiring efforts for the
success of the democratic candidates.
Mr. Springer, the new chairman, is
one of the most active democrats

Decatur county, and under his direc
tion ther will be an aggressive cam
paign this year.
Xo Opposition ('.*).
The Des Moines papers and some
others have been persistently publish
ing that there was no opposition to
Dr. J. W. Reynolds for the position
of chairman of the democratic state
central committee, which reports are
doubtless emanating from the Reed
Reynolds gang which have been in
control of the state committee. That
there is opposition, and decided ,op
position to Reynolds has been known
for months. At the county conven
tion held in Leon last Saturday, an
anti-Reynolds delegation was select
ed and instructed to use all honor
able means to prevent the election of
any party who had been guilty of
appointing non-resident republicans
to office which rightfully belonged
to democrats under a democratic ad
ministration. At Osceola .the Clarke
county democrats instructed their
delegates to vote against Reynolds
for his perfidy to them. All over
the eighth district there is opposition
to Reynolds and democrats all over
the state realize that Reynolds is
simply the tool of Nick Reed, and
not the proper man to head the state
committee. He has been recogniz
ed as a "wet" man, and his election
will greatly hamper the election of
E. T. Meredith, the democratic can
didate for governor, who is an avow
ed temperance advocate. Reynolds in
sulted and proved a traitor to the
democrats,of Decatur county in his
endorsement of a non-resident repub
lican for postmaster at Leon over the
protest of the county organization and
fully 90 per cent of the democrats of
the county. If he wants to see the
democratic party successful this fall
in Iowa, he should withdraw as a
candidate for committeeman, for
there is absolutely no chance for suc
cess so long as he heads the state
committee.
Had a Little Private Cyclone.
E. Housh had a little private cele
bration at his farm just south of
Leon on the Fourth, and enjoyed the
experience of a real twister. Just as
the rain came up, the twister struck
his place, the rain being carried
round and round by the cyclone, sev
eral haystacks were blown over and
a small building standing in the or
chard was turned over. About the
same time lightning struck in the
pasture adjoining the barn and Mr.
Housh's favorite riding pony was
killed and another horse was knock
ed down. The cyclone only lasted a
very short time and was all over be
fore the family could get in the cel
lar, to which they starred when
things began to move,
•Vf
The republican county convention
held at the court nouse in Leon last
Saturday was well attended, as the
delegates had the important business
of nominating a candidate for repre
sentative, but they had nothing to do,
as the matter was quickly settled by
all of the candidates except B. M. Rus
sell, of Lamoni, who received the
highest vote at the primary, but not
enough to nominate, withdrawing,
The convention was called to order
at 11 o'clock, A. P. Olsen, of Leon, I
being named as temporary chairman
and J. S. Parrish ana Jas. F. Harvey
temporary secretaries, and the tem
porary organization was later made
permanent.
When the matter of nominating a
candidate for representative came up
C. W. Reeder, one of the candidates
announced he had withdrawn in fa
vor of the high man, Mr. Russell, and
the other candidates, Mr. Mallory,}
Mr. Dye and Mr. Poush followed suit,
and on motion the secretary was in
structed to cast the entire vote of the
convention for B. M. Russell, and he
was declared the nominee. I
At the conclusion of the conven
'tion a meeting of the precinct com
mitteemen was held at which J. A.
Mcintosh, of Leon, was selected as
county chairman, and W. H. Shields,,
of Leon, secretary and treasurer.
A Request. I
We, the undersigned citizens of
Decatur City Iowa, living on 4th
street, running from the public
square north to S. W. Robbins' cor
ner would ask the auto drivers to*
slow down their autos to 10 or 15
mile3 per hour. We are asking this
favor on account of the dust that the
autos stir up in fast driving, which I
blows in the porches and houses. Alsto I
there is danger of running over the
children. I

A Quiet Fourth in Leon.
It was just like Sunday in Leon on
the Fourth, all of the business houses
being closed, and no one on the
streets, everybody going.to some oth
er place to celebrate. The celebration
at Grand River was a big success, as
they only had rain for a few minutes
in the forenoon which made it all
the more pleasant, but south of Leon
there was a very heavy rain, the
cerebration at Pleasanton having to
be abandoned, and the commence
ment exercises of the eighth grade
which was to be hela in the park at
Davis City had to be abandoned as it
rained hard at Davis City for two
hours and a half, and all autos were
held up until late in the evening be
fore the roads could be traveled.

Catfish Breakfast—Fried Chicken

Dinner, With All the Trim
ming*—All Report Most
Enjoyable Time.
By exceeding all previous June
sales records by at least 10 per cent
the Hurst store force earned a full
days outing on Grand River 'at the
firm's expense.
Monday evening, at 7 o'clock Mr.
James Mansfield, Robert Crouse, J.
W. and White Hurst accompanied
one of the big auto trucks loaded to
the guards with good things to eat,
camping equipment and fishing tackle
to the camping ground at the
Woodard dam.
Early the «ext morning the rest of
the party autoed to the scene of the
big frolic and all sat down to a real
catfish breakfast prepared by chief
cook Mansfield.
At high noon a fried chicken din
ner was indulged in by the jolly
crowd but according to all reports the
chief cook had resigned his job and
refused to let up on fishing until
dinner was announced.
At the last minute Mr. John Hurst
of Chicago telegraphed that he would
be unable to join the party in person
but would be with them in every
thought.
Each spent the day as best suited
their individual taste. The swim
ming and fishing were fine and a
tired but happy party rolled into
Leon late the evening of the Fourth.
The store force say they can do it
again and John and Jim are ready
to give them the chance so a year
hence the same contest will be wag
ed.
The $5 check for the largest indi
vidual sales for the month of June
was won by Mr. Mansfield but only
by a narrow margin over Miss Pullin
and Miss Sell.
Auto Drivel's are More Careful.
City marshal Marion Osborn tells
us that the autoists are doing fine
this year, and he desires to express
his appreciation to them for their ob
servance of the traffic rules and regu
lations. Fully 95 per cent of the
cars driven on the streets of Leon
are handled in a very careful man
ner, the drivers endeavoring to obey
the laws. The past week, however,
one driver was arrested for speeding
with the cut-out open, and an effort
will be made to enforce the law in
regard to running cars in the city
with the cut-out open. There is a
state law which makes it a c,
operate any motor driven $
with a cut-out open within tr-"
ported limits of any city or
has never been enforced in Leon,
but is going to be in the future, so
you had better see that your car is
muffled while driving in Leon. The
cut-out is an abomination, and there
is no earthly use
for
'any driver to
use it open while driving in town.
Two Good Specials.
The Idle Hour theatre has two ex
tra good feature plays for the coming
week. On Friday Charley Chaplin,
the highest priced movie actor in the
world will appear in the famous pro
duction, "Shanghied," and you'll
laugh till your sides are sore at this
ludicrous play.
On Monday the feature play is
"The Gods of Fate," featuring Rich
ard Buhler and Rosella Brice, in
which there is a train wrecked and
the story involves a deep laid plot
where the villain steals the plans for
an air brake patent. A big factory
is destroyed by fire in this thrilling
production.
Special, matinees both days at 3
o'clock, and the first evening shows
will start at 7:15. Prices are 10 and
15 cents.
An Auto Collision.
Commodore C. M. Akes and editor
Grant Mallory captain of the Davis
oity News, had an auto collision at
the Akes farm just south of Leon
last Saturday evening. Mr. Akes
was just turning in at his gate, which
put him on the wrong side of the
road, when Captain Mallory rounded
the corner, also on the wrong side of
the road, and they met just at the
gate. Commodore Akes' big Buick
escaped with a few scratches, but
Captain Mallory's Ford was consid
erably bunged up by the impact. As
the old Leon-Davis City feud was ami
cably settled some time ago, Commo
dore Akes threw out a tow line to his
old adversary, and brought his ship
to a Leon garage for repairs.
Bradford ltuys Another 400 Acre
Farm in Decatur County.
S. C. Bradford, the Des Moines cap
italist, who has invested several hun
dred thousand dollars in Decatur
fcounty farm lands during the past
few months, this week bought another
400 acre farm in Garden Grove town
ship, owned by Thomas and Bert
Teale, for which he paid $36,000.
The deal was negotiated by A. M.

and son Bert have only owned this
farm a few years, end cleared several
thousand dollars ffom their invest

ternoon. Just after dinner Wm.
Hebener came up town, hunted Hen
ry up and told him there was a
strange fellow hanging' around their
residence and he wished he would go
down and make him go away or ar
rest him. Henry asked a number of
questions as to how long the fellow
had been there, what he was doing,
etc. Will told him he first noticed
him about 10 o'clock Sunday night,
and he had been lying around there
ever since, making lots of noise and
was a regular nuisance. Henry said
alright, he would go down and tend
to him. So arming himself to the
teeth he started out to arrest the
bold bad man. He kept his courage
up until he reached the house and
not seeing anyone outside, went up
and knocked at the door, and in
quired where that fellow was who
was hanging around there. He wilt
ed completely when they told him
the stranger was comfortably located
in the best bed in the house, and was
the new son of Mr. and Mrs. Hebener,

Sixty Acres of Pop Corn.
•,&»•••
8 PAGES
VOLUME LXII, NO. 47.
Our enterprising and progressive
farmer friend, Alex Nickell, has
planted sixty acres of nice pop corn
on his large farm east of town. The
ground had been prepared in the
spring, and planted to ordinary field
corn, but failing to get a tood stand,
Alex conceived the idea of planting'
the ground to pop corn as a com
mercial venture. He obtained the
seed through the Lineville Feed'*''
Store, eight bushels of shelled pop^
corn drilled being required to plant*^
the sixty acres. This variety matures,
in little more than sixty days from
time of planting and yields from 25
to 40 bushels per acre. It is alwayft
