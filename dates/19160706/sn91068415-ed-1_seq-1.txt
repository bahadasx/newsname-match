It is rather uuusual to call for a

MlEKilt SEWS LETTER.
Special Correspondence
Raleigh, N. C, July 4. The men
who piled up the big vote received
by Roosevelt in North Carolina at
the last election, and who were hop
ing to see him whip out his enemies
in the Republican Convention and
capture a dual nomination at Chi
cago last months are now apparent
ly the most disgusted set of politi
cians visible in this neck of the
woods.
Roosevelt surrenders to the Re
publican politicians and his tardy
declaration of support of Hughes,
and his "private conference" a few
night ago with Judge Hughes, have
combined to actuate a large per
centageof them to "swear off" on
Roosevelt dope for all future tim
That a large number of them wiii
vote for Wilson is very evideut. and
they are not mealy-mouthed in say
ing so.
There is no enthusiasm over
Hughes; his personality as an indi
vidual forbids it. and those who vote
for him will do so largely because of
tne temptations offered by the Fed
eral pie-counter, if a change in ad
ministration could be effected.
Republicans Disappointed.
Charles G. Latta, the patient
whose charges precipitated the re
cent investigation at that institution,
escaped from the Central Hospital a
few nights ago by sawing his way
out." His escape recalls the collapse
of the charges which had been
helped along by several others, in
eluding a report by the board of in
ternal improvements.
It was "narrated aionnd that the
latter or somebody representing . it
or connected with this board, would
deliver several more or less severe
blows at the management and con
ditions when the hospital inquiry
got under way. After the ex stew
ard and some others failed to sub
stantiate even a small portion of
their voluminous "charges," the
public turned to look for some testi
mony emanating from the State
Board of Internal Improvements.
But, instead, the message-ame that
as a witness and there was anoth
er collapse on the part of the prose
cution. But the most -disappointed
of all are the Republican politicians
who were getting ready to manu
facture some campaign material
and have found nothing to manu
facture it out of.
Trouble Grows Out of Primary.
Believing he was "hoodoed" out
of the primary nomination two
years ago, Mr. Wocd, the present
Democratic Register of Deeds of
Wake County appealed to the regu
lar election and, running as an in
dependent, defeated the Democratic
nominee by a large majority the
vote between them, being clearly
confined to the normal Democratic
vote, a Republican candidate being
in the field. Wood has no opposi
tion this year.
It is possible that history may re
peat itself in Wake County this
year, because of dissatisfation grow
ing out of the primary contest for
three members of the House of Rep
resentatives. K. B. Johnson, one
of the three candidate receiving the
highest vote (there being six voted
for), thought he was the nominee
until the board of elections decided
he had not received a "majority"
vote within the meaning of the new
State Primary Law, and ordered a
second primary between him B. H.
Pate, the fourth highest man on the
list. -
That so-called "second primary"
was supposed to have been held
!at Saturday, July first. But as
Johnson refused to enter it only a
few of his friends participated in it.
Johnson received over 50 more
votes than Pate in the first primary
and he declined to accept the
board's ruling. He has appealed to
the courts, and if beaten there, it is
said he may run as an independent.

BOYS TO ENCAMP NEXT ALONG
MEXICAN BORDER.
North Carolina Troops are Certain
to Go to El Paso Earl Pat
terson of High Point 111.
(By R. A. STAMEY.)
Cam p Glenn, July 2. The - next
encampment for the boys of the
first regiment will be El Paso, Tex
as, it was given out nere today, and
this definite information put an end
to numerous rumors and specula
tions around the camp. The route
to be taken by the troops on en
training has not been definitely de
cided, or at at least it has not been
given to reporters and the time for
movement is not yet known here,
no orders to that effect having been
received.
The third regiment now occupying
a prominent position of the camp s
life, brought 54 officers and 1120
men, bringing the total number in
camp up to 3548. People residing
in this section state that this is the
greatest assembly of troops ever
seen here.
Attorney General and MrsBick
ett are here and today dined with
General Young and uis staff. The
visitors were also guests ia an after
noon ' trip to the surf. Numerous
excursions today brought hundreds
of visitors and among the throng
were many relatives to see the boys
in ktiaki.
Earl Patterson of company M,
first infantry High Point, was carried
to the field hospital today with an
attack of the heart. His recoery
is expected.
Camp Glenn, July 3. Four; com
panies of the first regiment of the
North Carolina national guard were
formerly mustered into the national
service here today. These were
company A, Hickory; B. Gastonia;
D, Charlotte, and M. High Point
The latter bears the distinction of
being the first infantry company of
the state to pass into federal control
during the present tall -'

ville, was mustered in yesterday .1

day shortly before they took the
oath of allegiance and in eve? y in
stance was heartily cheered by tire
boys. -The
ire of company E, second in
fantry, Goldsboro. was aroused to
day and poured fourth upon one of
its members who is alleged to have
attempted to be disqualified in the
physical test. The young soldier,
said to be 17. feigned a stiff arm,
the boys claim, and after he was
apprehended he was decked in a
costume of yellow cheese cloth, the
color supposed to characterize the
streak, and forcibly paraded through
the camp. Among the trying ordeals
he was forced to undergo was to
pose at the train while several
young women passengers made
snapshots.
Company F led the infantry score
with percentage of physically sound
men, the score being oo. 1 he band
audi regimental infiirmary made a
score of 94 and 96, respectively; but
these may not with justice be rated
on the same footing with the ordi
nary infantry recruit.
Again it is only fair to r dd that a
number of men belonging to the
Asheville companies were examined
and rejected before they reached
Camp Glenn, and with High Point
running a close second with a per
centage of 83, the result may have
been different.
Winston-Salem lies at the bottom
of the percentage column, being
pushed over 56 per cent, of her total
roster. Mt. Airy is next to Winston
Salem, separated by a margin of
only two points.
Would be pleased for those who
owe us for subscription to kindly
