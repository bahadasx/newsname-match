cred.t is du-? for the 11)17 engage
ment of the KM!pato Chautatiqu't
for Marion. The v ate men and
all the atta-hes were polite and
afTable, and .were cuurteDui in
their deportment with all patrons
or others who came in contact
with them.
No ai to the attractions
there was no complaint. The
morning lecturer, Mr. W. B.
Amabury and the children's
worker. Mist Elsie Cummings,
were both up to the former
standard in quality if not in
number of their appearances.
Friday afternoon and evening
the Killarney Girls entertained
the crowd under -most trying
conditions as a flood second only
to Noah's fell during the day
which prevented many from
hearing Mr. WWRainey Bennett
although everyone who heard
him on a previous engagement
wished to have that pleasure
agaio. Weatherwax brothers
who were pleasantly remember
ed having appeaaed here on the
Lyceum Bureau a few years ago,
were gives an enthusiastic re
ception Saturday afternoon and
evening. ,
t) Monday afternoon's attraction
was Ng Poon Chew, the Chinese
statesman and scholar, whose
"New Orient and its relation to
us." was much appreciated.
The Pariah Players were en
cored frequently and by many
their entertainment was awarded
first place in the entire program
for genuine pleasure. The Scrru-
man Quintette Tuesday after
noon and evening was good and
they were encored. And the
White Hussars were a winning
number drawing big crowds to
both their engagements. Ernest
Harold Baynes' lecture on "My
Sild Bird Friends,", was one of
e best attractions of the Chau
tauqua, and as a result we are
to have a bird club in Marion.
The Bird Masque Sanctuary
Thursday evening was a taking
number, and was complimented
by many who enjoyed the ren
. dition. One enjoyable feature
was the participation in the play

unable to appreciate such h'gh

by Pierre Henrotte and Marcel

should remember her place was
the most trying andexactingore
as her audience, after a week of
entertainment was too critical,

to say that the Chautauqua as a

IMS BRAIN LEAKS!
Ed Baker says you can't make
the young folks believe it but it
is about a million times easier to
get married than it is to stay
married.
Newt Dollar says if some worn-
en were not dressed inat way
you would never be able to guess
that they were in mourning.
Uncle Billie Loyd says a man
always talks too much during
his courtship but he never real
ized th fact until after he is
married.
Miss Vina Harper who is a
good cook always snorts with in
dignation when she sees a cook
ing school graduate weigh and
measure everything she puts in
to what she is going to prepare.
Mrs. Albert Elder said to Mrs.
Duer my husband says I've
made another man out of him.
Youd better look out r the first
thing you know he'll be looking
around for another man's wife.
He had been courting th girl
for a long tim. It happened on
Sunday night after church. They
were sitting on the back porch
and she locked with ineffable
tenderness into his noble blue
eyes. Tom she murmured, dia'nt
you tell me once that you would
be wiliing to do any act of hero
ism for my sake. Yes Mattie,
I would gladly repeat the itate
ment now, he replied. Well Tom
I want you to do something real
ly heroic for me. Speak on dar
ling what is it? Ask me to be

long enough.
Uncle Tom Carlton says I nev

told a lie to his wife. He wm a

NEW HARDWARE FIRM

By a deal which was consum
mated th;s week, the firm of
Moore & Daughtrey becomes
Flanary & Daughtrey, Mr. John
A. Moore selling his interest to

The inventory has been taken

The firm is composed of two
of our most successful farmers,

put in an apprenticeship at farm
ing and know the needs of Crit
tenden county farmers and are
amply able financially to take
care of all the trade which wil
favor them with patronage.
The new member of the f m

man in the county, having bten
born and reared near Crittenden
Springs and having resid
ed here many years in the old
Blue homestead which, is his
property.
Mr. Dautrhtrey lives in his
own property purchased recent

NEW HIGH
L
Tbe Bonds Were Voted In Last
Saturday Afternoon, By a
Vote of 239 to Eight.
In the election held last Satur
day to vota $10,000 to piy for
the city's pirt on the' new con
solidated High School which is
to be built and controlled by the
county and town, there were 247
votes cat-239 -for the new
building (and a better Marion
and Crittenden county) and 8
against it. The vote .at.-cast
SaturJay shows how nearly the
people of Marion stand as one
when issues which have to do
with a better town and county
are before them.
The people of Marion are
proud of their school and in the
election Saturday it seemed that
most of the parents of Marion
were glad to have an opportun
ity ot voting an extra tax upon
themselves in order that thr.ir
hiluren, and the other children
of
the county may have the
cha-.ce to get an education.
The location for the new build
ing will be determined Boon and
work will begin at once oa this
building which will be one of the
most up-to-date in this part of
the state. The school manage
ment has been very much em bar
rassed for the last few months,
because with the room and equip
ment of the old building they
would be unable to take more
pupils in High School. By vot
ing the bonds necessary, the
school will be able to care for all
who wish to enter school in Sep-
tember. Mr. Christian and Mr.
Franklin both wear a smile that
won't come off .because they
realize now that they will be
able to care for the many de
serving young men and women
who have been asking for tuition
in the Marion High School. An
extra teacher will be added to
the High School Faculty this year.
