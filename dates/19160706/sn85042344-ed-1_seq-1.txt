government of Mexico to the end that
peace und order may be restored in
northern Mexico and along the bnr
dor Is expected hero to he the next
step of the 1'nited States in its rela
tions with its southern neighbor.
The crisis precipitated by Villa's
raid on Columbus. N. M.. and ul
miunting in tlie fight at Cnrriail,
Mexico, between America!, and Mexi
can troops appeared tonight to have
been dissipated by n Hinlcaljle note
from General Cnrrnnzn presented dur
ing the day by his ambassador dosig
nato here, Fllsen Arrelondo. 'I'hc
noto proposes that the rlilferencos be
tween the governments be settled by
mediation or by direct negotiations.
U Is remarkable for its brevity, lbs
restrained anil friendly tone and for
the absolute lack of any of the strong,
even insolent language which charac
terized the last two communications
from the do facto government. It
treats us a closed incident the ex
change of unfriendly eommwni cations
which brought war almost within
sight.
No formal comment on 'he note
was obtainable, from the slate depart
ment officials. A "opy was forward
ed to the White House immediately
on its receipt and President Wilson
will determine on the court to be pur
sued. The fait that Secretary Lans
ing completed preparations todnv tor
a month's vacation to begin Friday
is rernrded as significant, however, of

It is not krown whether a formal
reply to General - Carranza's note is
eoi'tem plated. Diplomatic usug does
not call for olio, and many officials
feel that more ran be accomp'ished
through informal discussion between
Mr Arredondo and Counsellor l'olk,

t
gord-by to Secretary Lansing on his
Mepartiire for his vacation. Prob
ably the preliminary steps necessary
m .u nn.,mirnii,.n of the informal
discussion will be taken then. State
department offlcla's appeared entire
ly satisfied with the definition of the
matters to be settled outlined In the
new Mexican note. It in presented in
this liinKuane as translated In the
embassy:
TlM'ro Am Two Problem.
"The American government be
lievts, reasonably, that tho Insecuri
ty ef Its frontier Is a source of diffi
culty and the Mexican government
on its part believes that the stay of
American troops on Mexican teriitcry,
aside from being- a trespass on the
sovereignty of Mexico. In the Immedi
ate cause of the conflicts. Therefore,
the withdrawal of American troops
on the one hand and the protection
of the frontier on the other are the
two essential problems, the solution
of which must be the directing or
der of the efforts of both govern
ments." Coupled with this dcflnlt'on la an
outline of a sort of military status
quo beyond the border which the de
facto government suggests es a sub
stitute for its previous demands fol
Immediate withdrawal of the Ameri
can troops. It Is stated as follows:
"In the meantime, (pending me
diation or direct negotlat-cn) "this
government proposes to employ alt
efforts thtt may be at Its disposal to
avoid recurrence of new ircldentk
which may complicate anr" aggravate,
the situation. At the same time it
hopes that the American f ivernment
on its part may make use of all effort
to prevent also new acts cf Its mili
tary and civil authorities of the fron
tier that might cause new complica
tion"." While the object of the negotia
tions thus i:' clearly outlined and ap
pears acceptable to the state depart
ment, the subjects to be considered
specifically will have to ho arranged
later. President Wl'son has made it
clear time and again that gradual
withdrawal of the expeditionary force
would be ordered once be was as
sured that Carranza forces would be
able to prevent further bandit out
rages against United State-i territory.

James of this city today announced
that on July 10 there would be a mass
meeting at Oklahoma Citv of all col
ored persons interested in the fight
aaglnst the adoption of the pioposed
literacy amendment to the constitu
tion, to be voted on at the primary in
August.
"Myself and other colored men of
Oklahoma believe that we can ob
tain much better results if we can
eliminate the political aspect from
the proposed literacy test amendment
to the constitution which will be
voted on in August," said James to
day in discussing ihe call for the
state meitim,'. "The negroes are In
terested in the defeat of this meas
ure. As evidence of that fact some
of the best negro orators of the na
tion are offering their services and
means for the purpose of defeating
this amendment. We hope to wage
a campaign of our own, using colored
speakers and distributing literature.
We believe we can thus effectively
destiny any arguments that the Dem
ocrats might make against the He
publicans for their opposition to Ihe
measure. ' ,
The literacy test amendment is
proposed i,y the Democrat of the
state as a substitute for the "giaud
lither clause." which has been
knocked out by the supreme eourt of
the I'nlted States. If adopted, its ef
fect will be to disfranchise hundieds
of whites anil colored people.

AlifS, July 5.--Hi p. in.)- The full

portune which tho Germans allach
to this point is shown in their fieri-,

they momentarily held. This village

when fierce hand-to-hand fighting

Many Prisoners
The number of Gorman prisoners
taken Is now close to Di.oui), while
the extent of the munition captured
is shown in the fact that sxly guns
were tak"n by u single a'uiy corps.

The tenacity with which tho tier

belief of thu military authorities that
tho Germans are chiefly concerned in

Tho French have now In some

they existed before the attack began.
The Germans are hastily constructing

The statement follows:
"North of tho Somme our troops

pletely captured on a front of two
kilometers, from the Clery-Mai Icourt
road to t lit river. Pressing our ad

tacked and carried the village of Hem
after a spirited baitle. The .Monaco
farm also fell into our hands. In the.
course of these actions three hundred
soldiers and threo olflccis were made

'.South of the Somme we repulsed
enemy counter-attacks on Relloy-en-Santerre
and t-Jisted the Germans
from tho part of the village of Kstrees
which they still occupied. A detach

compelled to surrender and we took
here two hundred prisoners. Trenches
