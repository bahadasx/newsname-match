London, July ?">.?Only two milea now lie between tieneral
Foch's troop. and Peronne, the jzreat railway centre which is the
immediate jr^al of thp French drive on the Somme.
Thp way has been cleared for a quick push over 'hat in
terval. On both banks of tho Somme to-day tho French forces
have struck with undiminished vigor and both strokes ha\o
ded.
North of the river the second German lines were carried on
a fronl of more than a mile, from tho Clery-Bfarioourl road to
tho Somme, and tho viilage of Hem was taken by storm. Thm
tho highway that runa into Peronne n controlled by the Allies.
South ol the river the (ierman second lin^ was carried
over a t'ro it. of more than six miles. and tho occupation of the
villapo of Katreea was completed.
With these Bucoesses the French will be able to straiprhton
tho salienf directly west of Peronne. Tho German hold on
Bstrees and tho Clery-Maricourt highway had tacked down tho
base of this wedge. It has now been loosened.
