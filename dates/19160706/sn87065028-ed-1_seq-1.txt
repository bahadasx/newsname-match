announcing the death of ( apt. W.

Capt. Mullin left here about ten
days ago in command of the local
company which form a component
part of the Mistdssippi National
Guard and which went to the mobili
zation cump at Jackson to join other
etate troops preparatory to an ad
vance to the Mexican border. He was
taken ill early in the week, and at
tending physicians diagnosed his
trouble as appendicitis. He was oper
ated on for appendicitis. The oper
ation however, developed the fact
that he was suffering 'from adhesion
of the bowels, and he died under the
knife.
The ' telegram announcing the
the death of Capt. Mullins was
preceded by a message stating that
he was in a critical condition, and
his brothers-in-law, Mr. V, M. Hig

SCHOOL BONDS WILL SOQN
BE READY FOR DELIVERY
FORM IS FIXED AND SENT TO
NEW ORLEANS TO BE LITH
OGRAPHED. At a regular meeting of the mu
nicipal council held Tuesday night
the form of bonds in the sum of $50,
000 recently provided for the erec
tion of a high school building was
agreed upon, and the bonds sent to
New Orleans to be lithographed. As
soon as they are returned they will
be signed by the proper authorities
and turned over to the Interstate
Bank and Trust Company, of the
Crescent City, which concern has the
contract for their purchase.
While the council has tentatively
decided to accept the proposition to
buy the Stephen D. Lee home as
site for the school, final decision in
the matter has not yet been made,
and Mr. P. J. Krouse, who has been
selected as architect, will arrive in
the city today to confer with the
city fathers regarding the matter.
According to news received here
from Pickensville, Ala., which is be
lieved to be authentic, Sam Meek the
negro who shot and killed Constable
Ed Upton near Crawford, Miss., Sat
urday afternoon, was lynched some
where near the Alabama town either
Sunday or Sunday night.
After having shot the .constable
Meek also took a shot at Dr. Bledsoe,
a physician living near Crawford,
who made an ineffectual effort to
effect his arrest. The shot went wild,
however, and the negro hiked out
for the Alabama line, his idea evi
dently having been to get into anoth
er state as soon as possible. A posse
started in pursuit, and is said to have
overtaken and hanged him at a point
near Pickensville either Sunday or
Sunday night, though news of the
lynching did not reach here until
Tuesday.
