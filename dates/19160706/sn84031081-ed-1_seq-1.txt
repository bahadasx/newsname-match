Uindnn, July 5. Tho French con
tinue to make more progress than the
British on the western front, owing
jittrtly to the more difficult ground
lacing the Hrltlsh and also to the
fart that stronger forces are oppos
ing them because of the belief among
the Germans that the main attack In
the present operations will be on the
Hrltlsh front.
Hut, despite their wlower prugress,
the liritlsh are successfully beating
bark heavy Herman counter-attacks
which have been delivered both day
and night in the region of la Bols
Kfile and Thiepval, and, generally be
tween the Ancre and the Sonime,
where they are making steady prog
ress. Germans' loss BO,tKt(.
It iH estimated that the German
losses in the battle of the Somme, thus
far are approximately 60,000. The
rapture of nuns has been compara
tively small because the Germans, in
anticipation of the offensive, with
drew their big artillery to longer
ranges before the battle began.
According to aerial observations on
tho French front in the direction of
I'cronne, there are now only threo
more trench systems between the
French and open country, and If a
break can be made in the German
lines here, it would be extremely seri
ous for the German, who are doubt
less hurrying up reinforcements to
make secure the threatened point. The
Germans are Rending reinforcements
to the battlefield from as far as Ver
dun and Lens, Hnd it is thought that
the ,'ontlnued heavy German attacks
on the Meuse may be intended to con
reel Important transfers of troops be
hind, the German lines.
Teutons on Counter Offensive.
A
report from Holland indicates
the Germans have prepared a
that
counter offensive between the Belgian
frontier and Arras, where H is ru
mored a formidable concentration of
artillery is being made.
The 'operations on the Russian
front show not the slightest diminu
tion in their intensity. Both Itussian
and German official corninuni, atlons
testify to the desperate nature of the
battles. The German are offering
stubborn resistance to the P.usslan
offensive in the Baranovb h region
bin on the whole the Russians appear
to have the. advantage here and also
in the Lutsk region.
In the Caucasus, however, the
Turks seem to be more successful in
holding up the tussian advance.
Italians lHlng hliar?.
The Italians are keeping up their
strong fight, and altogether the view
of the whole military field continues
ptoiuslng from the standpoint of the
entente allies.
Meanwhile, the political field has
almost as absorbing au intent. The
lluuianian government is said to b
greatly impressed bv the, recent mili
tary successes of the entente allies,
and today's news is that the two op
posing political parties in Rumania
hav& already joined force.; in favor or
pro-entente policy. Hopes, there

There, is reason to believe that, al

The Latest Note
from Carranza
" 'Mr Secretary:
" Ittferrtng to the notes of June .0
and '.'.' last. I hae the honor to say
to your excellency that the immediate
reh-PHo of the Cariial prisoners was
a further proof of the sincerity of the
desires of this govcrntm iit to reach a
pacific satisfactory arrangement of
present difficulties. This government
is anxious to solve the present conflict
and It would be uu.msl if its attitude
were misinterpreted.
I lie I wo rroiiicm.
"'It was also the Mixlcau govern
ment that earnestly suggested a plan
for cantonments along the boundaiy
line during the conferences of Ctudad
I Juarez, and R l'aso. This goMinment
Is disposed now, as it has always been,
to seek, an Immediate solution of the
:lo points which constitute the true
! cause of the conflict belwee.i the two
j countries, to wit; Tho Amciicun gov
jernment thinks reasonably that the
innscenrtty of lis frontier Is tv source
of difficulty and th. Mexican govern
ment on its part believes that the May
of American troops on Mexican tcrrt
tory aside from being a trespass on
the sovereignly of Mexico Is the innne
dlutc cause of the conflicts. There
ifore the withdrawal vf Ameiiiun
on one hand, and the protec
the tronllcr, on the other, are
two essentlnl problems ,the solu-
nii of which must ta the dlrcclitig
object of the efforts of both govern
ments. "'The Mexican government Is wil
ling to consider In a quick and prac
tical way, and prompted by a spirit
jof concord, the remedies which should
I bp applied to the present situation.
Wants Opinion on Mediation.
"Several U.tln-A mertcan countries
have offered their friendly mediation
to the Mexican government, and the
latter has accepted It In principle.
Therefore, the Mexican g.n eminent
only awaits Infoi million that the gov
ernment of Ihe I'nlled Slates would
be disposed to accept this mediation
for the purpose mentioned above or
whether It Is wtlll of the belief that
the same resuils may be obtained by
means of direct negotiations between
both government.1;.
" In the meantime this government
propt'ses to employ all elforla that
may be at its disposal lo avoid the
recurrence of new incidents which
may complicate and aggravate the
situation. Al the aame time It hopes
that the American govcrnmctil on its
pa l'l may make use of all efforts to
prevent also new acts of its military
an, I civil authorities id the frontier
that might cause new complications.
" I avail myself of Ibis oppoitiinlty
to reileiale to your excellency ttie
assurance of my most dlsllngul.'-bed
consideration.
