Charles E. Hughes, Republican
nominee, announced at the
of an interview with Theodore
which lasted for more than
and a half, that he and the
president were in "complete
accord."
Mn Hughes issued the following
statement:
"I am very much pleased with Col.
Reesevelt's letter of indorsement and
he has expressed himself in a very
kindly way with respect to my tele
gram to the Progressive committee. I
wanted to talk with Col. Roosevelt
folly with respect to the issues of the
campaign and asked him to dine with
that we might have that oppor
tunity. He dined with me and we had
very delightful interview. We talk
ad folly over all matters, and are in
complete accord. The evening has
been a very pleasant one."'
Will Co-Operate.
It Is understood that Col. Rooses
vdt toid Mr. Hughes he would co-op
erate heartily with him in any of his
plans, even to the extent of making
a speaking tour if Mr. Hughes so de
aired.
The Republican nominee and Co1.
Beesevelt dined alone. The waiter
who served them was barred from the
Teem except when especially sumrajr
•*& by a call button.
After the interview Mr. Hughes em
«rged with Col. Roosevelt, escorted
the former president to his automo
bfle and warmly shaking his hand
as he bade him good-bye. When the

^Good-bye, and the best possible
loefc"
Colonel Pleased..
CoL Roosevelt when seen later be
fore his departure for his home at
Oystaf Bay, said that he and Mr.
Hughes had had a most satisfactory
trik aai that he was really greatly
pleased. The former president made
it plain that he agrees with the atti
tude Mr. Hughes has taken toward the
que Ht ions of the campaign and he as
sued the nominee that he would sup
port him with the utmost heartiness.
CoL Roosevelt said that Mr. Hughes
stated he might desire the Colonel to
aid in the campaign, and it was ar
ranged that in the fall Col. Roosevelt
should make three or four speeches fot
Mr. HugKes.
Former President, W. H. Taft said
"that he was willing to work side by
side with Col. Roosevelt to aid Mr.
Hughes. Asked if he would be will
ing to speak from the same platform
as Col. Rooosevelt, he said:
"I am for Hughes. I would not let
«»y personal feelings interfere. Tf
such speaking arrangements were
made I would act as a private in the
Tanks and obey orders."

Fer three days, Saturday, Sunday
and Monday, the Danish Brotherhood
of North Dakota held their Fourth
animal session in this city. This is
solely a fraternal organization, where
people coining from Denmark' may
congregate and become acquainted
and enjoy a fine program and outing.
There- were a large number present

the state organization is apart "of the
national organization.
FOURTH QF JULY
tJcHiBEAUTIFUL DAY.
One .could not imagine a more beau
tiful day to celebrate the glorious 4th
than we had Tuesday. Monday night
we had a nice rain, and Tuesday was
bright and warm and with a nice
breeze, and was just an Ideal day.
People began to arrive the evening be
fore and Tuesday saw a large crowd
in the city and at the Chautauqua
grounds. In the city Lynn J. Frazior,
the Republican nominee for Governor,
spoke about noon to a fair sized au
dience and then most of the crowd
went to the Chautauqua grounds to
join in the celebration, fa the morn
ing at 10:30 there was a-ball game at
the park near the city, between the All
Nations team and the Brinsmade Sin .-s
—The All Nations won out. Tn the
afternoon at the Chautauqua -.ik
there were two games between the
Knox and Starkweather teams, and
both games were witnessed by a £ood
crowd. The Starkweather boy:- won
both games, the first one by a score of
6 to 3 and the evening game by a
of 4 to 2. Besides the ball games at
Chautauqua there was a good program
at the auditorium both afternoon and
evening, winding up with the movini
picture show, after which there was a
grand display of fireworks at the lake
front. It was a very satisfactory day
to all, and we believe that everybody
had a good time.
INDIAN WARFARE.
The fight at Carrizal may be taken
as an example of what Americans ma
expect in Mexico, if the expected gen
eral intervention is found unavoidable.
There will be no organized campaign
by the Mexican forces. Four years of
anarchy and guerrilla civil war have
made the Mexicans a military rabbie,
unable to grasp the meaning of scien
tific warfare. It is, moreover, doubt
ful if there is a constitutionalist gen
eral competent to command in any
large undertaking. Vill^the one
leader of proved ability, is still under
proscription.
The Mexicans will doubtless fight
the United States as they have fought
one another. There will be sporadic
dashes and forays. Small American
detachments may be ambushed by tho
Mexican troops or by irregulars who
will benefit from their accurate kuow
ledge of the country. Despite inferior
leadership, Inferior equipment and n
ferior discipline the browti soldiers
will fight bravely enough, for the Mex
ican is not a coward. He will win few
battles, but he will be difficult to beat
He can fight and run. He is more than
half Indian, and the tactics of Indian
warfare will doubtless be largely fol
lowed by the American commanders.—

ABLY.
Washington, July
4.—General
Lacking In Definiteness
The embassy synopsis of the new
note indicates that a specific state
ment still is lacking.
Only a close study of the reply will
disclose whether it will be necessary
to press General Carranaza again to
affirm or deny the hostile construction
placed on his orders that American
troops be attqcked'if they move in any
direction except toward the boundary.
Without doubt the effe!t of the em
bassy's statement as to the note's
character has been, to relax still fur
ther diplomatic^ tension between the
two governments.
The release of the Carrizaly prison
ers already has stripped the situation
of |ts immediate dangerous character.
It is entirely possible, however, that
American'officials will not foHy share
the opmistic views of the
embassey when they are able to review
the language of the Carranza note.
One fact stood out clearly in the
minds of the officials familiar with
President Wilson's desire and purpos
es. If General Carranza sincere'
wishes to find away for peaceful set
tlement of differences between the two
governments, he will be met more ih
half way. The diplomatic discus?* on
foreshadowed in that event, however,
would have to be wholly aside fo
the steps the Washington government
deems necessary to take, to protect
American lives and property along the
border.
Pershing Won't Withdraw.
No proposal for immediate wi'h
drawal of General Pershing's troops
would be withdrawn as a preli binary
to a further exchange of views on joint
operations against bandits.
The embassy's synopsis of the latest
communication indicates that the de
facto government has sought tc bring
its side of the diplomatic corr pond
ence up to date. It is framed as a re
ply both to the American note refus
ing to entertain any request for the
immediate withdrawal of A(«.ericar
troops from Mexico and to the latter
stern command presented after the
Carrizal incident iot release of pris
oners taken in that fight and for a for
mal diplomatic statement of intention.
Lansing Spoke Sharply.
In both of the documents Secretary
Lansing sharply repremands the de
facto government for failure to ob
serve diplomatic usages.
His first note resented charges of
bad faith, political intriguing and the
like, openly stated in the Mexican de
mand for withdrawal the second fof
esly notified the de facto goven^ment

MARKEDLY CO
NOTE REACHES WASHINGTON
WITH OFFICIALS AW.vY FOli A
HOLIDAY.
Car-
ranza's formal reply to the twe sharp
notes he received from the Washing
ton government, regarding the situa
tion on the border and in northern
Mexico, was at the Mexican embassy
here tonight awaiting presentation to
morrow to Secretary Lansing, by Eli
seo Arredonio, ambassador designate.
It arrived by telegraph early in tho
day and only the fact that the fourth
of July- was being celebrated, by all
government departments prevented its
immediate delivery.
OF Conciliatory Nature.
A verbal synopsis of the communi
cation made public by embassy at
taches with the approval of Mr. Arre
dondo indicates that it is of an unex
pectedly conciliator}' character.
The ambassador himself spent the
day in the country and on his return
excused himself from any discussion
of his government's attitude as now
officially stated.
Lacking the text of the note, it was
impossible tonight to say whether i.
would prove satisfactory to President
Wilson since the release of the Amer
ican troops taken at Carrizal, the
question at issue between the Wash
ington government and General Car
ranza has been narrowed to Mr. Wil
son's desire for a formal declaration
of intention toward the American ex
peditionary forces in Mexico.

building of its kind in the state.
There was quite a disp-nv- of fire

Col. E. T. Barrett of the Webb Pub

getting up a complete atlas of the
county, which will be published later.
He is an old soldier, having served in
the Civil War and also in the Philipine
war. He is a true and loyal American
and also an able speaker, and those
who heard him make a talk-recently
at the meeting in front of the city hall
and also the Fourth of July are con
vinced that he is an orator of ability.
For forty years he was engaged in the
newspaper business, and is now work

While Mr. and Mrs, Charles Bos

driving to the city from the cemetery
and as they were coming up the hill
near the Mercy hospital, Peter John
son attempted to pass by them ijLhi?
car and the car struck the hind wheel
of Mr. Bosworth's buggy, tearing off a
wheel and throwing the occupants out.
Mr. Bosworth got a few bruises and
Mrs. Bosworth got a bad shaking up.
while the little one got quite a cut on
his leg. It was a narrow escape and
only a miracle that they were not ser
iously injured.
Smyser Baughman, a young man
who was practically reared in this city
but who has not been here for nine
years, spent the 4th with his sister,
Mrs. Robert Collinson and friends. He
is the son of John Baughman, who for
many years run the Sevilla hotel, but
now of Philadelphia, Pa. Smyser is
now with the advertising department
of Ringling Bros., circus, and as that
big show is going to be in Grand
Forks, he was there looking after the
advertising and took a run up here to
spend the day.
For three days, July 1, 2, and 3, the
Crary-Turner Insurance Agency held
their annual meeting at the Chautau

teen of their men present and a most
enjoyable time was had. Each year
they hold a sort of reunion and enjoy
themselves and this year was one of
the most successful meetings yet
During the month of June this agency
wrote $418,000 insurance in North Da
kota.
George Laird of Webster was a vis
itor in the city Friday. Mr. L:Vr«:l was
one of the men who received the Re
publican nomination for lepiesenta
tive from this county, and we predict
that he will be a good man for the po
sition and will be elected in the fall
beyond a doubt. Those who know him
best say that he is all right, and we
can generally judge a man pretty well
by what his neighbors have to say
about him.
Ed. and M. S. Kneisel had a motor
cycle race with Martin Scharf and his
Dort. While Martin has been run

MISS FREDA SCHLICHTING LOS

A wire reached this city Tuesday
night that Miss Freda Schlichting,
daughter of Mr. Schlichting, who
works at the Burtscher Tailoring shop,
had been drowned in a lake ne ir
Granville, and asked that her father
be notified. Mr. Schlichting was no

he caught the night train for Gran

been obtained at this time.
Miss Schlichting was a graduate of
the local high school, and was a splen

who knew her and her death was a
sad blow, not only to the relatives but
a large circle of near and dear friends.
She had been teaching school near
Bantry and her mother was living on
the Schlichting- homestead near that

the lake with some friends when tbe

WARNING TO
Ttte Ku Klux Kl&n's warning to in-'
tended victims was three dried peas.
Singular, but the order itself was sin
gular and did nothing after conven-'
tional lines. These would be sent etc
marked man at intervals and no word
to accompany them. If he were re
siding in the south during those troi
blous days, he would know the signi
ficance of those mysterious, but seem
ingly harmless peas and if he were
guilty of a misdeed against either the
cause of the south, and of it's tradi
tions or the silent, deadly band who
thus remembered him, his days wc
surely numbered and there was no es
cape from their vengeance but b'
death at his own hand—and seldom
was there that.
One dared not breathe the name 0*
the organization for fear his nearest
neighbor might belong to it and many
a man suddenly disappeared because,
of unguardedly making
9,
careless re-
mark about the Ku Klux K'qn. -v*
When first hastily gotten together,
it is said, these modern knights en
rolled the best and noblest blood in the
Old South, but after their specific mis
sion was completed and a stable lai£
regulated the rights of the southern
people, their services were no longer
required and they disbanded, when
the hoodlums and desperate charac
ters of the land took up the order an
used it to cover their own deeds, thu
bringing down upon the name of
the "Clansmen" the odious reputation
they have ever since borne.
Many blood curdling tales were told
of their doings and secret and deadly
workings.
The rides and rescues of the Ku
Klux so. graphically, dramatically set
forth in the Birth of A Nation are
those of the original, right-enforci'
organization of true sons of the Old
South.
