The French captured 76 cannon and
several, hundred machine guns.
There was no infantry fighting on
the Verdun front. The war office
says -the Germans are attempting to
bombard the cathedral at Verdun.
English Report Advances.
London.—"Near Thiepval (on the
Somme front) we made a further
slight advance and captured a num
ber of prisoners," war office an
nounced today. 'V3outh. of Labasee
'canal,' after' a discharge of gas and
smoke, we made some successful raids
into'the enemy's first line. In one of
these, the Royal Welsh Fusilliers
especially distinguished themselves,
capturing forty prisoners, a trenoh
mortar and a machine gun.
"In another raid, the Highland
Light Infantry, successfully entered
the enemy's trenches west of Hulluch.
The machine gun emplacement was
destroyed, many Germans were killed
and some .prisoners were taken.
"There was no change of import
ance on the rest of our front."
French Make Progress.
London, July 6.—The French con
tinue to make more progress than the
British on the western front, owing

Jt t\
partly to the more difficult ground
facing the British, and also to the
fact that stronger forces are opposing
them because of the belief among the
Germans that the main attack in the
present operations will be on the Brit
ish front.
But despite their slower progress,
the British are successfully beating
back heavy German counter attacks
which have been delivered both day
and night in the regions of La Bois
selle and Thieupval and, generally, be
tween the Ancre and the Somme,
where they are making steady pro
gress.
It is estimated that the German
losses in the battle of the Somme thus
far are approximately 60,000. The
capture of guns has ben compara
tively small, because the Germans, In
anticipation of the offensive, withdrew
their big artillery to longer ranges
before the battle began.
According to aerial observations on
the French front in the direction of
Peronne there are now only three
more trench systems between the
French and the open country and, if
a break can be made in the German
lines here, it would be extremely seri
ous for the Germans, who are doubt
less hurrying up reinforcements to
make secure the threatened point.
The Germans are sending' reinforce
ments to the battlefield from as far
as Verdun and Lens, and it is thought
that the continued heavy German at
tacks on the Meuse may be intended
to conceal Important transfers of
troops behind the German lines.
A report from Holland indicates
that the Germans have prepared a
counter offensive betwen the Belgian
frontier and Arras, where it is ru
mored a formidable concentration of
artillery is being made.
The operations on the Russian
front show not the slightest diminu
tion in their intensity. Both Russian
and German official communications
testify to the desperate nature of the
battles. The Germans are offering
stubborn resistance to the Russian
offensive in the Baranovich region,
but on the whole the Russians appear
to have the advantage here, ajjd- also
In the Lutsk region.
In the Caucasus, however, the Turks
seem to be more successful in holding
up the Russian advance. According
to a report from Constantinople by
way of Vienna the Turks have driven
the Russians out of Kermanshah.
The Italians are keeping up their
strong fight, and altogether the view
of the whole military field continues
promising from the standpoint of the
entente allies.
Meanwhile the political field has al
»"»t, as .absorbing an intent. The
Rnmanisn government is said to "be
greatly impressed by the recent mili
tary successes of the entente allies,
and today's news is that the two op
posing political parties in Rumania
have already joined forces in favor of
a pro-entente policy. Hopes, there
fore, are revived here that Rumania
soon will be found in active co-opera
tion with the allies.
There is reason to believe that, al
though the British government and its
allies disavow any real change in
policy as a result of the abandonment
of the declaration of London, steps
have been taken in the neutral coun
tries of Europe which will have the
effect of increasing the economic pres
sure on Germany.
Many
Russian Prisoners.
Berlin, July 6.—(By wireless to
Sayville.)—A total of 158 Russian
officers and 23,025 men were taken
prisoner during the month of June
along the line to the south of the
Pripet where the Russians were push*
Ing their offensive, according to the
Austro-Hungarian statement of July
1, received here from Vienna. The
statement says:
"Russian war theater: Near Tlu
mach a mass attack by Russian cav
alry six ranks deep along a front of
three kilometers was made against
the Austro-Hungarian troops of Gen
eral Count von Bothmer's army. The
Russians were dispersed, suffering
heavy losses. Otherwise in' eastern

portant occurred.
"I" Volhynia, attacks of the allied
(Teutonic) armies are making pro

south of Ugrinow and west of Torchin
and near Sokul.
"Since the beginning of June south
of the Pripet 158 Russian officers and
23,025 men have been taken prisoner
and several cannon and ninety ma
chine guns captured.
"Italian war theater: On the Do
berdo heights, fighting activity de
creased considerably in the northern
sector after violent engagements in
which the Austro-Hungarians main

southern sector the Italians continued
their attacks, which were repulsed

FULL FORCE TO

Germans Attach Importance
to Sormont Farm—Make
Fierce Counter Attack.
Paris, July 6.—The full force of
the French offensive is again being
exerted both north and south of the
Somme, but principally southward. In
this direction the French are now in
the outskirts of Peronne, the great
railway center which is their first ob
jective in their effort to cut the Ger
man communications.
Sormont farm, taken by the French,
is only two miles from Peronne and
adjoins its suburban houses. The im
portance which the Germans attach
to this point is shown in their fierce
counter attack last night when they
rushed the French lines back to the
village Belloy-en-Santerre, which they
momentarily held. This village lies
between Asservillers and Estrees, both
held by the French, so that the Ger
man rush temporarily made a dent
in the French advance. This dent
was quickly straightened out when,
fierce hand to hand fighting placed
the town again in Franch hands.
The number of German prisoners
taken is now close to 10,000, while the
extent of the munitions captured is
shown in the fact that 60 guns were
taken by a single army corps. Mean
time the movement north of the
Somme is necessarily retarded in order
that the French left wing may act
simultaneously with the British right
wing.
The British have been facing an
extremely heavy resistance and large
German reinforcements were hurried
forward all day yesterday by the
Cologne-Cambral railway, which runs
to the very center of the German
front attacked by the British. The
stubborn resistance all along
front has prevented the British from
keeping pace with the French advance
to the south.
The tenacity with which the Ger
mans are holding to their positions in
the face of the British attack, par
ticularly around La Boisselle, while
the French menace of Peronne is com
paratively neglected, loads to the be
lief of the military authorities that
the Germans are chiefly concerned in
breaking the. British offensive even at
the sacrifice of some ground to the
south.
The French have now. in tome
plaoes, pushed through the third and
last line of the German rtifsnses as
tlMy existed before the attack tisgan
The Germans are hastily oonstruoting
a new line but are manifestly unable
to make it aa strong as the three tines
