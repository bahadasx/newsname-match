This summer has been a bad one for
forest fires in New Mexico and Arizo-
The forest service reports more
fires than for a number of years. Last
week there was a fire a few miles west
and about half way between Torreón

days before it was brought under co.i

over amounted to about one and one-
half square miles. The timber de
stroyed was mostly tie timber.
County Agent Harwell is active just
now in urging the bean farmers to stay

farmers heed no prompting in this mat
ter, but we- hear that a few are getting
discouraged. Just now Mr. Harwell is
busy veritying prices being ottered.
and will be ready, shortly to tell you
what you may expect.
The month of June was some warm,
and there was not a trace of rain at

and 93 on the 17th and 27th. The low
est night temperature was 38 on the
4th, 7th, 8th, 21st and 22nd. There
were 19 windy days, but most of them
were not very bad. There was a pret-
tv tair shower in the varney neighbor
hood about a week ago, and it has
been ' hxing for about ten nays.
Yesterday there were light showers
over the north end of the valley, and a
pretty good rain in Mountainair and
vicinity. There was enough sprinkle
here to mitigate the dust nuisance
somewhat. This forenoon a heavy
rain fell over the west half of the val
ley, and Btift showers in other parts.
Estancia got enough to make the gut
ters run freely. As we go to press
there are showers in several directions.
The rains are beginning in a normal
way, and the indications are tor plenty.

OBITUARY
Jennie Mabel Andeison Bard
was born in Clay Center, Kan
sas, April 3, 1878. She fell
asleep in Jesus Tuesday morning,
June 6, 1916, in the Methodist
National Sanatorium, Silver City,
N. M. Born in a Swedish Meth
odist Parsonage and receiving a
good Christian training, she
grew up an obedient daughter, a
pleasant scEoolmate, an earnest
worker, a true friend, a beloved
wife and a good mother.
She was graduated from the
Public School, attended the High
School, and with high honors was
graduated from tho Chicago Mu
sical College. During ten years
of her life she taught music
She was converted to God at
the ege af fourteen, b Humboldt
Park during a revival in h
father's church.
active interest in the wo... ui the
Lord, teaching in the Sunday
School, serving as officer in the
Epworth League, and organist
tor several years. For several
years she was leader and director
of church choirs. She loved, to
go to the House of the Lord, was
always a good listener, a cheerful
giver, always ready to speak for
her Savior and talk to God in
simplicity and faith.
She united in marriage with
Rev. Neis W. Bard in Chicago,
III., September 27, 1905. One
hild, Willis Emanuel, was born
to them. He lived less than fif
teen months and God took him.
Sister Bard was greatly be
loved by all who met .her. She
was acquainted with grief, but
sought and found the true solace
in her many sorrows. Her only
brother, her mother, and the only
child passed away within a Bhort
time. A sufferer for years, she
sympathized with the afflicted
and made many sincere friends,
everywhere 3he went. Her
friends never heard one word of
complaint or worry amidst all
her Batterings. J ..
She was a lover of beauty, of
righteousness, of peace and be
lieved in and lived the real and
true Christian life. Her noble
spirit, her sweet life, and her lov
ing heart inspired those, who
knew vher more intimately, to
live a more Christ-like life. Her
husband says "She made me a
better man, a more devoted min
ister ef the Gospel, bhe was
ever a great help to me aB a
preacher and as a pastor. '
Wherever the call led her hus
band, she gladly followéd him.
Their field of labor included places
like Kewanee, Victoria, Chicago
and Galva, Illinois; Fort Sumner
nd Estancia, N. M,
She has suffered more or less
during all of the last four years,
and has fought the disease which
caused her death, with a strong
will, and a faith superhuman;
sweetly trusting in God to help
her, she was courageous and sure
that He would do what was best.
Since the first of the year, she
had been very poorly. Two
months ago, she went, in com
pany with her husband, to our
Sanatorium at Silver City, hop
ing to regain health ?.nd strength.
She sent home encouraging re
ports considering her serious ill
ness at the time she arrived at
the institution; but the last week
she grew worse and the end came
peacefully, releasing a Christ
like spirit into a larprer lite to re
ceive the crown of glory.
She leaves an aged father and
her devoted husband, relatives
and a ho3t of friends who mourn
her deeply.
Funeral services were at li,s
Uncia. at the Methodist church
last Friday morning in charge of
Rev. C. 0. Beckman, of Albu
querque. The remains were

ft COMMON ERROR
The Same Mistake Is Made By
Many Estancia People.
It's a common error
To plaater the aching bark,
To rub with liniments, rheumatic
joints.
If the trouble comes from the kid
neys.
It's time to use Doan's Kidney Pills.
Here is convincing proof of merit.
Mrs. S. M. Rodriguez, S. Palace
Ave., Santa Fe, N. Méx., says: "I
had a very bad pain in my back and I
also had trouble with the kidney secre
tions. I used a box of Dean's Kidney
Pills and was cured. Two months after
that another of my family was taken
with kidney complaint. This one was
unable to work and felt weak. Two
boxes of Doan's Kidney Pills were used
and since then, this one hasn't had any
kidney trouble. We are certain that
the cure is a permanent one;
Price 50c, at all dealers. Don't Bim-
ply ask for a kidney remedy get
Doan's Kidney Pills the same that
Mrs. Rodriguez had. Foster-Milburn

Worn Out?
No doubt you are, il
you suffer from any of the
numerous ailments to
which ait women are sub
ject. Headache, back
ache, sideache, nervous
ness, weak, tired feeling,
are some ot the symp
toms, and you must rid
yourself of fhem in order
to feel well. Thousands
of women, who have
been benefited by this
remedy, urge you to
TAKE
The Woman's Tonic
Mrs. Sylvania Woods,
.of Clifton Mills, Ky., says:
"Before taking C a r d u i ,
I w as, at times, so weak I
could hardly walk, and '
the pain in my back and
head nearly killed me.
After taking three bottles
of Cardui, the pains dis
appeared. Now 1 feel as
well as I ever did. Every
suffering woman should
try Cardui." Getabottle
