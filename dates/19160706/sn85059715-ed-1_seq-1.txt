PARIS. July G?Last night was
generally quiet north and south of
the river Somme, says today's olDclal
statement of the war office.
There was a few local engagements
during the night In which the
Germans captured two small woods
north of Hem. The French also captured
a wood.
Germans Repulsed.
South of the Somme the night
nassed In quiet. A German counter
attack on Belloy was repulsed easily.
Tho French have captured seventysix
cannon and several hundred machine
guns.
There was no infantry fighting on
the Verdun front. The Germans are
attempting to bombard the cathedral
at Verdun.
More French lb-ogress.
The Anglo-French offensive in Plcardy
haB had another day of substantial
progress, outstanding features
being the resumption of the
French advance north of the Somnie
and the capture of German second
positions there.
Completo preparations had been
made quietly in this section virtually
unhindered by the Germans while the
French forces south of the river
pulled up level and got a thorough
grip on German southerq positions.
This was accomplished by the ejection
of Germans from the part of
Estres they still held and the capture
of their communication between
Kstres and Belloy. The northern
troops then emerged from their
trenches and dashed forward a good
mile.
Germans Weakened.
The Germans' second position had
heen so demolished by artillery that
they were unable to make a strong
# resistance except at the village of
Hem. Here the attacking troops
met desperate opposition. Kach bouse
ruined was fiercely disputed, but b7
dint of hard fighting the villnge was
won as well as Monacu farm to the
southwest.
The French consider the capture of
Hera as of considerable importance
for it commands the passage of the
river to Feulileres already in their ;
handB. Its possession thus assures
a direct bond between corps on
either side of the stream.
The Germans are beginning to react
more vigorously as reserves arrive,
particularly Bouth of the Somme
tnd the French advance there is hotiy
contested. French critics expect
that the Germans will concentrate all
their former energies in defense of
the villages of Barleux and ViilersCarbonnel.
The former bars the ra-j
