possession for two weeks, as he is now
temporary manager of the Hichmond
Supply Co.'s store.
Mr. Daykin during his short stay in
Yale has made many warm friends
through his thorough business princi-
files, courteous treatment, square deal

commanded a large trade which Mr.
Cooper will no doubt hold for Emerson

Yale, having made his home here for
many years.
While we regret to lose Mr. Daykin
from the business and social life of

YALE WINS GAME
Tuesday Was Ideal for Game and
Contest Was Exciting.
Both the weather man and luck were
on the side of the Yale Boosters last
Tuesday p. m. and they were able to
snatch a victory from the fast playing
Anker-Holth team from the Tunnel
city. The ideal weather and the big
picnic were instrumental in bringing
one of the largest crowds that ever at
tended a base ball game at City park,
and the teams were appreciative enough
to treat the spectators to a hard fought
contest. The score was by no means
small, yet it was kept so close that it
was nobody's game till the winning
run was made by Yale in the last half
of the ninth.
The way the visiting team started
oat in the first it sure looked as though
the Boosters had runup against a snag.
But this feeling was only short lived,
for in their half of the same frame our
boys came back and went the visitors
a lew better. The fray closely resem
bled the battle of Verdun in many re
spects. Both "armies" claimed the
victory, and it was too bad that both
teams couldn't win. The score was
tied a number of times, and lovers of
the game were on the anxious seat
from start to finish.
Enright and Goshneck were the bat
tery for the visitors and they received
excellent support from their team
mates. Hallman, Johnston and Allen
attended to the mound work for the
Boosters and the trio did very well,
thank you. The entire team played
real fast base ball.
The game was finished early in the
last half of the ninth when Yale got a
run, the score being 9 to 8.

THE GLORIOUS 4TH
Large Crowd Celebrated In Yale.
The Day One Long to Be Re-
membered.-City Park an Ideal
Spot for Such an Occasion.
Tuesday. July 4th. 1916, will go down
into history as one day in all the year
when the citizens of Yale, surrounding
country and from a distance enjoyed
themselves to their heart's content.
From early morning until late at night
some entertainment in the way of an
auto parade, athletic sports, an excit
ing game of base ball and a fine dis
play of fireworks interested the visitors.
The members of Sacred Heart parish
served meals, lunches, ice cream and
soft drinks to the hungry and thirsty,
and not one went away without hav
ing his fill.
The speeches by Fr. Command, of
Trenton, and Kev. Crlssmau, of Fort
Huron, were good, and were listened to
with attention and Interest. McKanlass
Band, of l'ort Huron, furnished music
all day. A report of the baseball game
will be found in another column.
The receipts of the day from all
sources amounted to $940.00. When bills
are paid a neat sum will be placed in
cemetery fund of Sacred Heart church.
Work of County Agriculturist
A considerable portion of last week
was spent outside of the county. Cow
Testing Association affairs and a con
ference of County Agents at East
Lansing occupied the first three days.
The two main subjects discussed were
"Marketing" and "Farmers' Institutes."
While there the agentB had the privi
lege of hearing lectures on the selling
of farm products by Dr. Cance of the
Massachusetts Agricultural College
and Mr. Bassett ot the United States
Department of Agriculture. That this
question is rapidly coming to be an
important one in county agent work
was realized by all who took part in
the discussion, and the need of co
operative organization, together with
the improvement of quality, was es
pecially emphasized by the lecturers.
While at the College arrangements
were also made with field agents for
further demonstrations in the county.
C. B. Cook, Assistant State Leader, is
with us the present week assisting
with drainage problems. During the
week beginning with J uly 17th, Mr. J.
11. Carmody will give some thinning
and spraying demonstrations.
C. W. Waid, Extension Potato Spec
ialist, will be here about the middle of
August to assist with the potato in
spection. During the early part of September
Mr. C. P. Keed will work in St. Clair
county taking a farm management
survey. This work is being done in
answer to a number of requests for as
sistance in the analysis of the farm
business, and it is expected that it will
point out the main lines along which
the county agent should direct his
efforts.
While at East Lansing, too, the mat
ter of securing a man to take Mr.
Hale's place as tester for the Cow Test
ing Association was given attention,
and Mr. Wesley Moulton of GlenEllyn
Illinois, has been hired for the remain
der of the year. Mr. Moulton is a
graduate of the Missouri Agricultural
College, which has one of the best
courses in dairying In the United States
and it is felt that we are especially for
tunate in obtaining a man ot this
calibre for the work.
C. L. Brody, County Agent
