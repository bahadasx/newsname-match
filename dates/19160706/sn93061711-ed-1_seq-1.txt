Although it now looks like Mexico

train loads passed through Tucumcnri

If necessary go over the line after
Mcxicnns who lire across the line. War
does not look half so had when you
read of it hut rather than lose thous
ands of Americans lives most of this
nation will rejoice if this matter is
entirely settled without war. The fol
lowing telegram will give some idea
of the situation at present:
Washington, July H The reply of
the de facto government of Mexico to
the demands of the United States, con
ciliatory in terms and giving assur
ances of a desire to reach a friendly
adjustment of the difficulties between
the two countries, was delivered at the
stute department today by a Mexican
embassy attache.
Brief and free from superfluous lan
guage of diplomacy, the communica
tion points to the release of the Amer
ican troopers captured at Currizul as
proof of the Mexican government's
sincere desire to avoid a conflict.
Mnny Troops PaHs Tucunicari
The national guardsmen who arrived
in this city during the past week were
a husky looking hunch of boys and
will make good soldiers. All of them
seem to have seen very little of the
sun hack east and are blenched. As
soon as they get the henellt of "old
sol" down here, there will be a big
change in their appearance. All of
them seem anxious for a fight and
thoy would more than make good if
thoy had a chance.
The nrtilery and regulars make a
better appearance and look ready for
action within a few days after they
reach the border. All they need is
a little rest, after the long ride from
the eastern coast to Kl I'aso, which
took them six and seven days. Prom
tho appearance of some of the trains
it looks liko the eastern railroads just
picked up every old scrap they had in
the yarda and put the boys therein
and expected them to make the best
of the situation.
The heat here kept the boys under
cover most of the time, but Sunday
a hunch of tho Massachusetts, togeth
er with their fine band marched sev
eral blocks in the resident part of
town. Tho band played a number of
selections which were enjoyed im
mensely by those who were lucky
enough to hear them.
There were three trains here at one
time Friday and most of the boys were
allowed complete liberty. These fel
lows were from Mass., New Jersey,
and New York and were members of
tho national guard. One of the offi
cers said all the men were old mem
bers as they did not bring tho new re
cruits. He said they hnd no trouble
securing new men to fill up nil va
cancies as tho eastern boys were anx
ious to make tho trip to see the coun
try and fight in its behnlf.
Tho guns enrried by the nrtilery
are modern nnd look to be in an ex
cellent conditioh nnd in readiness for
immcdinto action.
Only a small portion of the hun
dred and fifty trains have passed this
city. Tho R. R. Co. has practically
suspended nil other business it possi
bly could nnd is devoting its entire at
tention to tho moving to troop trains
southwest. The railroad men hardly
have time to sleep before thoy are
called to make a trip. The pay roll
next month will be the largest ever
received in Tucumcnri. The Bhop men
as well au the train men are kept on
the go and Tucumcari would certain
ly he a lively place if business would
continue like it has during the past
two weeks.
THREE WAR ZONES
With more than lfiO.000 troops as
sembling along tho Mexican bordor,
tho war department has taken steps to
decentralize direct administration of
the 1800 milo frontier in tho interest
of efficiency and probably to pavo the
way for tho appointment of a supremo
commander to co-ordinate nil military
activities on tho international line.
Tho border formerly in the southern
department from the Gulf of Mexico
to California now is to be divided into
three military departments, command
ed by Mnj. Gen. Frederick Funston,
Brig. Gen. John J. Pershing and Mnj.
Gen J. Franklin Roll.
Wnr department officials said tho
new order, which automatically re
llovcs Gen. Funston of supremo com
mnnd on tho bordur and tho enormous
responsibilities that hnvo crowded up
on him, had no significance ns indi
cating preparation for war.
There was no announcement in ro
gnrd to tho probnblo selection of a
senior major general for commander
in chief of tho border guard and field
forces. Thoro are indications that
IS EAGER
AVOID WAR
Mnj. Gen. Leonard Wood, now com
manding the department of the enst,
Is being considered.
The statement Issued by the depart
ment says:
"The present Southern department
is divided as follows, with assign
ments of command thereto ns indi
cated; "A- -The Southern department to be
under command of Maj. (Sen. Freder
ick Funston, to embrace that part of
the present department to a lin c:ist
of Kl Paso.
"H The department of New Mexico
with headquarters at Kl Paso, Texas,
to be estnbllshed under the command
of Hrig. Gen. John J. Pershing to ex
tend from western boundnry of south
ern department to the 10'Jth .ncridinn.
"C That portion of tho Southern
department west of thi 109th morldinn
to be assigned to the western depart
ment, under command of .Mnj. Gen. J.
F. Hell, with field headquarters for
same at Douglas, Aria."
Gen. Hell is now in command of tnc
Western department with headquar
ters nl San Francisco. He also is a
former chief of stuff of the urmy.
Pending the appointment of an offi
cer to supreme command, the func
tions of the three department; will be
co-ordinated through the war depart
meat.
At least .'0,000 national guardsmen
will be on duty at tho Mexican border
within the next two or three days. The
Infantry and cavalry arc being fur
nished with automatic machine guns,
250 of the new type of which wore or
dered recently for immediate delivery.
As an experiment the guns will be enr
ried in automobiles insteud of on puck
mules nnd five chnuffeura will be re
quired with each regiment to operate
the cars.
AVOID CREASES WHEN YOU
ARE FITTING INNER TUBES
The inimitablo Mr Dooley wiys that
the thick end of a base ball bat will
convince a man more quickly than any
argument.
I must confess, however, sayB Mr.
Tarpley of tho Ford Garage that in
the present case at least, the Doolcyan
method docs not appeal to me.
r or even as tho pen is sometimes
mightier than tho sword, so the thing
itself is more convincing than a mere
description, and I believe I can per
suade the motorist, by showing him a
badly creased tube, that it is impos
sible to lavish too much caro and at
tention on his tires, nnd on all the lit
tle details connected with them.
I ime nnd again I have insisted that
a tube must be placed evenly inside
a casing, and thnt every crease must
bo got rid of at all costs.
I have shown my customers thai a
carelessly fitted tube will be subjucl-
ed to abnormal tension in several oth
er places; I huve warned them that
after partly inflating the tube, before
finally fitting, that it should be care
fully placed in the casing without any
twisting, and care should be taken
when mounting that tho tube is not
pinched between the etlges of the bead
or between the beads and the rim.
Remember that tubes will Inst very
much longer if they arc properly fitted
and at the same timo the motorist will
be saved a good deal of trouble.
The Michclin tube is the easiest to
fit, Mr. Tarpley states, for tho reason
that it is formed on a circular man
drel to the exact shape of the inside
of tho casing, and is not simply n
straight piece of tubing forced into a
circular form and cemented. Michclin
tubes, being shaped to fit the casings
as stated, ure not easily pinched when
mounting, as they are longer on tho
outside circumference than inside next
the rim, and for thnt rcuson do not
form into folds when mounting. Tho
straight tubes on tho other Iwd, do
form into folds next tho rim when
fitting, so extra caro must be used
when fitting ordinary tubes to pre
vent the folds pinching between the
beads themselves or between the bends
and the rim.
HOY SETS FIRE TO HOUSE
A little boy and a match came near
causing a disastrious fire at tho home
of Mrs. Parker in tho northeast port
of town Wednesdny.
Tho mother was working over a
cotton mattress when tho little son
evidently playing with a match, light
ed same and set fire to tho cotton. It
iiv turn set (Ire to tho insido of tho
room and for a time it looked like the
house was doomed. Tho firo boys re
sponded to tho cnll nnd mndo a hurried
run but the neighbor put tho firo out
with small hose uttached to neigh
boring hydrants.
Tho furniture nnd kitchonwarc wus
badly damaged by firo and water but
tho house was saved. Mrs. Parkor
is just completing n valunblo addition
to tho house nnd tho carpenters nt
work thoro gave vnluablo nssintanco
in putting out tho fire.
NKW SCHOOL IIUILDINC; TO
HE HUIIr AT (JRAI)Y, N. M.
The citizens of Grady school dis
trict, forty miles southeast of this
city, have decided to build a now school
house, and bonds in the sum of $5000
have been voted for this purpose. The
plans for the new building have al
ready been prepared by G. L. Murrny,
of Hard, and as soon as the bonds are
sold, which will bo in the course of tho
next two weeks, work on tho building
will be commenced. It is the inten
tion to have tho building ready for oc
cupancy by the timo for opening of
school in September.
Other new school buildings will be
erected in Quay county during the next
two months and this part of the state
will keep in the front rank in tho mat
ter of properly housing the school
children.
ROAD ROOSTERS HERE
Several auto loads, containing a
large delegation of road boosters frnrr
Glenrio and Endue neighborhoods were
in the city Monday to appear befow
the Hoard of County Commissioners
in the interests of a proposed road ex
tending from Porter, New Mexico, due
east to the Texas line.
Among those of the party whose
names wore obtained wero C. G. Hail,
W. R. Ryars, K. I). Holtzclnw, M. M.
Kcnnard, S. I). Roberts, Aca Home,
and Lee Jackson.
The road boosters interviewed mem
bers of tho Hoard of County Commis
sioners and presented their reasons for
opening the rond, and received assur
ances from members of tho Hoard that
they would get the new road.
The proposed road is about thirteen
miles in length and will open up a road
for travel which will serve several
hundred people to the north and enst
of Endec and Glenrio. Wo aro in
formed that every landholder on both
sides of the proposed road, who is now
in the country, except one, has made
a grant of right-of-way, waiving dnm
ages, in order to secure the road.
A very strong sentiment appears to
exist in favor of tho road on account
of giving a road to the Texas line,
which will permit the farmer and
stockman to ship from and to the
Texas line, in order to get the benefit
of the Tcxns line freight rate.
The News editor had an interview
with Mr. Lee Jackson, why staled thnt
they hnd been wanting this rond for
some months but had been unable to
get action on it. He said that he had
talked with some of tho Republicans
out there, and that they told them not
to talk to Republicans, to go talk to
the Democratic county commissioners.
Mr. Jackson said the delegation w th
hi:;, was all Democratic, and thnt thc
hnd sovcrnl hundred more out there
just like them; that thoy had never
gotten anything out in their part of
tho county, and now they wero looking
for something good and strong.
We hope our Democratic friends
will get the new road.
UNIVERSITY A LIVELY PLACE
Albumicrmic. N. M.. .Inlv fi..vrin
Sigma Chi fraternity at the New Mex
ico suite university has accepted the
plans for what will lie the most. iininm
and one of the most attractive fra
ternity chapter houses in the United
States. It will he. in comnlotoil farm
a quadrangle of Pueblo Indian archi
tecture, framing a paved placita, with
galleries on the outside and sleeping
porches on the insido of the second
floor, and with an arrangement of the
first tloor which will give the frater
nity an ideal home for livintr wm-V
entertainment and the varied activities
of college life. The Sigma Chi chap
ter here was installed a year ago. It
has existed for vears as tlm Siirmn
Tau local fraternity and has a large
alumni membership. Three years ago
mo iratermty purclnihed a residence
in Pueblo architecture, built by the
late W. G. Ticrht whilu lu wns nnmi.
dent of tho University. It will add
another unit to this huildinu- lit unci'
at an expense of about $5,000. This
win include atltiitionn: living rooms
for members, a lnrire chanter hull nml
dancing floor, a gymnasium, shower
natns, living room, largo dining room,
sleeping porches and a steam heating
plant. Other sections of the buildlm'
comprise a building plan covering sev
eral years and to Do carried out as the
fraternity has funds available. The
new building to be built this year will
relievo some of the pressure on the
already over-crowded University dor

in mo university this year now Is
practically certain to bo realized.
LITTLE BOY'S EYE BADLY

while plnying with a broken jar. He

OUR DUTY AND MEXICO
No matter what the outcome of the
present difficulty mny be this country
can show fnirly clenn hands in its po
litical relationship with Mexico for
tho lost sixty years. One adminis
tration after another has reflected tho
desire on tho purt of the people of the
United Suites to deal thoughtfully nnd
patiently with every problem that
might arise between the two nations.
This country has never tried to Im
pair Mexican nationality. We have
tried to encourage nnd protect it. We
can look buck with good deal of sat
isfaction to tho aid wo gave in the ex
pulsion of European forces from Mex
ico after our Civil War. Wo can point
to u long period of yenrs during which
every dispute wns discussed and set
tled calmly nnd amicably. Tho whole
thought of one administration after
unother has been to give Mexico a
bunco, and that has been the thought
of the people of this country. No sen
sible Mexicnn can doubt that but for
tho protection of the United States
Mexico would long ago hnvo censed
to exist us n separate politicnl body.
It would have disappeared in 18(1(5.
There has been uvery inccntivo to
greed nnd ambition to toko nnd hold
the country. Time nnd time ngnin de
liberate nttempts to got us into wnr
hnvo been thwarted by the good-natured
nnd hopeful belief among our
people thnt some dny nnd somehow
Mexico would work out her own des
tiny in her own way, nnd thnt the more
powenui we became the better able
wo were to let her go on without even
criticizing her faults.
Undoubtedly this truth is as clear
to the intelligent Mexican people as
it is to us. Tho question is whether
we are dealing nt the present moment
with the intelligent Mexican people
or dealing with the Mexican people at
all. Aro Carranza, Obregon. Villa,
Zapata in any sense any more repre
sentative of tho Mexican people than
Jesse James was of the Missouri farm
ers who hntcd nnd harbored him for
years nnd welcomed the day when it
wns no longer nccessnry to fenr him ?
There nro undoubtedly mnny thous
ands of Mexicans who would welcome
honornble relief from the intimidn
tion they have had to endure for tho
last few years. They don't want to
give up their nationality. They will
still cry "Viva Moxico." Hut it is im
aginable thnt they would liko to go
hak to tilling thilr land, hording their
cnttle, keeping their shops without the
fenr thnt at any hour a robber bnnd
calling itself a vavalry squadron might
fall upon them, steal their cash, mn
off with their cnttle or enrry uwuy
their grnin. The whole north of Old
Mexico luis been so overrun by these
ruffian gungs thnt industry hus stop
ped completely. The distress of tho
poor people is beyond words. One
group or another of these desperadoes
has swept across the country until a
wolf could hardly live on it. Officers
with General Pershing's column re
port things too terrible to repent nbout
the efforts of women and children to
obtain food.
If we had a humane reason for go
ing into Culm, we have at least as good
a reason for going into Mexico. If
we hnd one selfish reuson for going
into Culm, we have a hundred for go
ing into Moxico. It is humiliating
that n country which is under our pro
tection, which exists us a political unit
becnuso of our protection, and for
which we are responsible in the eyes
of other govenrments should be the
only country in tho world where tho
life and property of an American cit
izen nro not respected by the so-called
authorities. It is unbearable that
the pretended government of Carran
za should not only permit but connive
at the invasion of American territory
and the taking of American lives. And
also, it is highly dangerous to the fu
ture safety of the United States whon
these matters are Interwoven with
the ambitions and antagonisms of a
foreign power. Colliers Weekly.

London, Knglnnd., July &--A Router
dispntch from the western front today
says the Germans made a counter at
tack on the new British positions at
Thiepvnl, after a heavy bombardment,
but were easily repulsed. Prisoner
are quoted us having stated that Ger
man units arc being rushed to the
Somme front from as far us Verdun
to the cast and Lens to the north.
According to this dispntch u Gor

THEY'RE NOT LEAVING QUAY
Some of the Republican nowspnpers
of the stute ure expressing consider
able gratitude in the thought of tho
prospect of the dry weather of tho
last several weeks driving Democrutic
settlers out of enstcrn New Mexico.
"The drouth is driving out tho Dem
ocratic voters," they arc declaring,
gleefully. "If it just continues there
won't be muny of those several thous-
und new Democratic votes left by this
tall."
Throughout eastern New Mexico
muny thousnnds of acres of valley and
mesa huve been taken up nnd trans
formed into productive farming dis
tricts by settlors who entered this
state several years ago. Cities and
towns huve been built, und millions
ndded to the wenlth of New Mexico.
This development now is being extend
ed by the homesteaders nnd others
who hnvo come in within tho lust few
yours to cstnblish homes nnd join the
enrlier builders of the empire thnt Now
Mexico is destined to be. These set
tlers nro tho hope of the common
wealth; the stnte must hnvo them to
become productive und prosperous.
Hut simply nnd solely because a ma
jority of them are from Democrutic
sections und believe in Democrutic
principles of government, tho New
Mexico Republican bosses, who live in
the central nnd wostern purt of New
Mexico, would hnvo them driven from
tho stnte, nnd the wenlth thnt they
will wrest from tho lnnd, lost to New
Mexico. In other words, nny cnlnmity
thnt might result in ridding tho state
of Democratic voters, would be wel
comed, regurdless of future conse
quences.
It takes ull classes of citizenship to
mnke a world, and Now Mexico is rep
resented by more different clnsses of
people thnn nny stnto in the union,
unless it be Culiforniu. Few of the
settlers, if nny, of those who have
really settled nro leuving Quny coun
ty. These men nnd women entered
the state determined to establish their
permanent homes and nid in building
up prosperous communities. Thoy nro
not frightened by tho present dry
spell; they can see tho success attain
ed by tho earlier Bottlers, nnd they
aro uw;ro of tho splendid crop record
of Inat year, nnd they will rcmnln horo
long enough to enst tholr votes for
the best men in tho November elec
