FARMER CHARGED
WITH INCEST
Last Saturday in the district court
Charles Dyson had a preliminary hear
ing on a charge of incest. During the
absence of County Attorney Adair,
Attorney Dickinson represented the
State, anil the defendant was bound
over for trial in the sum of $2,000,
which he failed to furnish. Dyson, who
is separated from his wife, is a pros
perous Aberdeen farmer, and his al
leged victim is a 19-vear-old daughter.
The unnatuAl alliance was discovered
by the local physician ,wlio was called
to treat her for a miscarriage. Al
though she is somewhere in Nebraska,
where it is reported she is in hiding,
Attorney' Dickinson succeeded in hav
ing her father held for trial.
The defendant's son swore that his
father's intimacy with his sister was
the cause of his mother's leaving home,
and that such intimacy existed for sev
eral years, and was the cause of several
miscarriages.
CANDIDATE FOR TREASURER.
In this issue L. G. Wells announces
his candidacy for the ofliee of county
treasurer of Bingham county.
Mr. Wells has had some experience
along this line and is well qualified to
perform the duties of the office to

tauqua county, Kansas- He has taught
school a number of years and has had
considerable experience as a book

WHO GETS THE PONY?
The pony contest closed yesterday at
midnight, when the last ticket was cast
aud the counting will commence today.

mistaken. The pony and buggy will be

ATTORNEY WINS OWN CASE.
The case of Mrs. W. 11. Harmon vs.
!{. .1. Dygort, which was tried in Judge
Ball's court last week, resulted in a
verdict for the defendant. The suit was
for $22.50 rent money, which the de
fendant, who defended himself, did not
deny, but claimed he had a contract
with the plaintiff's husband which he
contended absolved him from its pay
ment. Judge Ball was convinced of
the defendant's attorney's argument
and hendered his decision in his favor.
The complainant was represented by
Attorney Beakley.
ONE HUNDRED QUARTS OF
BOOZE CAPTURED
Shelley had a big, rousing 4th of
July celebration, at which there were
many out of town guests, mostly from
Idaho Kails. Among the most promi
nent and influential characters present
was John Barleycorn, and judging from
the enthusiasm of a great number of
] the celebrants, his presence had the de
sired effect, as tfygv were very hilar
ious. In the evening^,gome one informed
th^riieriff's office of John's presence,
annnfieputy Sheriff Dann and Detective
DavBHChainherl|uii made a raid ore
the pifffltiotic burg and located the cache
underneath the floor of Dan Holt 's res
idence in the suburbs, where five sacks
were secured containing one hundred
quarts of Sunnvbrook. It is said that
John was fifteen sacks strong when the
celebration started. The possessor of
the booze, who is said to have been act
ing as an agent only of some bootlegger,
had a hearing yesterday and was bound
over for trial.

j to travel, not only as a matter of lie
J eessity, but would welcome an oppor
trinity to use the railroad to a much
greater extent for pleasure and recrea
tion, at some concession in fares, the
Oregon Short Line Railroad has taken
a great step forward in offering attract
ive excursion rates—EXACTLY' HALF'
KATES FOR TICKETS GOOD ONLY
ON SUNDAY'S, and a little higher fare
for tickets running from Saturday over
to Monday. And in the present day,
when automobiles are so common and

A MYSTERIOUS CONTEST.
The Suit Luke Blackfoot
nin
torcyda
race last Sunday drew a b
ig <•
rowd to
see the finish in this city,
, wli
deli did
not seem to give much
satis
■fact ion,
much less amusement, to th
or the participants.
e sp
ectatora
The object of the contes
t it
it can
lie ealled such, is a myste
IV,
even to
the participants. Sk'ill, endurance or
speed seemed lo be no consideration, I
and the only apparent. ' result was j
bruised bodies and broken motors. It ]
is said to have been a scheduled race 1
of endurance, and a prize of $100 was
awarded the winner. The second prize!
was $60, and $40 was offered the man !
who took third place. The race start
ed at 6 A. Af. Sunday morning, when Ilia
weather was fine mid the roads good.
The contestants were released two min
utes apart, or about a mile in point of
distance. A thirty-three mile an hour
schedule had to be maintained for six 1
hours. Each rider had a schedule and
a watch fastened on his handlebars,
where he could read as he went along,
and if he approached the checking sta
tions too early he had to slow down,
stop or wait, but if he was behind his
time on the schedule he had to make it
up or be disqualified. The finish of the
race was at the corner of Pacific and
AVnin streets in this city, where they
were met by a large and curious crowd,
wlio have not yet learned any advanta
geous object of the contest, if such
can be called a contest. Battered ma
chines and bruised and tired riders
seemed the only outcome of the mad
race, the riders in which quarreled all
day among themselves over the spoils
The German who reached the goal sec
ond, and was disqualified for some un
known reason, claimed a foul play and
threatened to mow down a fellow rider
with a chair at the Cottage Hotel. The
fastest time made between here and
Salt. Lake City was five hours and forty
minutes.
BLACKFOOT WINS BALL GAME
The Blackfoot ball team scored two
victories this week, the first being Sun
day, when they played with the Ameri
can Fulls team, the score being 20 to
2 in favor of Blackfoot, and the second
on the Fourth of July, when they met
the Sugar City team, and again scoring
high, the score being 19 to 2 in favor
of our home team, Blackfoot making
18 hits, and Sugar City only 1.
A FORTUNATE ACCIDENT.
While enroute to their ranch at
Springfield last Thursday in their auto.
Mr. and Airs. Tanner met with nil acci
dent in which they were lucky. Mrs.
Tanner was guiding the car when it
plunged into a ditch at Thomas and was
capsized. The car was badly demoral
ized, but its occupants escaped with
but. few slight bruises.

DANGER OF WAR
IS AVERTED
Washington, July 5. — The crisis be
tween the United' States and Alexi. o
virtually came to an end today when
n friendly and conciliatory note from
the de facto government was handed
to the state department and promptly
communicated to the President. No
statement was issued by the President,
but there was no doubt in officials'
minds that the way was opened for an
amicable settlement of a dispute as
to the bonier situation which brought
the two governments to the verge of
war. Secretary Lansing gave the im
pression, however, that Carranza's sug
gestion that there was no pending ques
tion between the governments which
cannot, readily be answered by friendly
negotiations meets quick sympathy
here. Further interchange of views is
expected to begin immediately, looking
to joint efl'orts to curb border bandits
and other irresponsible agencies that
worked to embroil the two governments.
