Snake Bit Him.
Last Sunday, while Ray Desh-

Mills, was looking for snakeroot,
he put his hand into a hollow
place made, probably, by a
groundhog. Instantly, he felt a
sharp sting and he withdrew his
hand with a copperhead pnake
hanging to it. His arm began to
swell and Charlie Duffy rushed
him to McConnellsburg in his au

tor applied remedies, and while
Mr. Deshong suffered greatly
from the poison, it is thought
that he will recover.

How to Raise Dollars.
Much time is spent in trying
to find out how to raise cattle,
hogs, poultry, wheat, corn, Cain
and the Divil, but the majority
of people do not, apparently,
spent much thought in learning
how to raise Dollars. Dollars is
a crop that most people admire,
desire, and perspire for, and yet
a crop that many people tail in
raising.
It would be impossible to raise
a crop of wheat if the seed were
wasted; or if planted, was riot
cu tivated. Almost everybody
boys and girls, as well as men
and women, have the seed (cent?,
nickles and dimes) to raise a
great crop of Dollars, but they
waste the feed, instead of plant
ing it, cultivating it, and watch
ing it grow.
Before you spend that cent,
nickel, or dime, take a good look
at it. Think howmuch labor and
time you would have to expend
to replace it. Think how long
you may have to wait before you
have an opportunity to earn an
other. Before you let it slip out
of your fingers, . think whether
you could not do just as well
without the thing for which you
are going to spend it. If you are
spending it for something to
merely gratify your appetite -for
something to satisfy the cravings
of a vicious habit take a drink
of cold water, and keep your
money.
It is the needless expenditures
the buying of things that have
no value within themselves that
keep many people poor.
Just now our banks are doing
much to encourage a habit of
thrift especially among children
and youths. To any one apply
ing, they will furnish a neat
"Home Savings Bank" into
which your pennies, nickels and
dimes may be placed, and when
you have a dollar, it may be plac
ed to your account in the bank,
and the bank will pay you com
pound interest on it
Just as sure as acorns will
grow into giant oaks, cents will
grow into dollars if they are
planted in good soil and cultivat
ed correctly. A little money put
in a Savings Bank is not a talent
hidden in a napkin. It is earn
ing all the time, like heart beats,
its work goes on while you sleep,
and even Sundays the capital is
growing large and nobody com
plains of broken laws. If you
put only two dollars a week by,
you will be a hundred dollars
ahead in less than a year.
1 cent a day in 5 years will be if 18.25
10 ernts a day in 6 years will be 12.60
50 cents a duy in 5 years will be 912 SO
1.00 a Cay in 5 years will bo 1.82V0O
The above does not take into
account the accumulations of in
terest that will be added to it.
Almost anybody can lay aside
a dime a day. Place a dime in
the bank every day (you do not
need to go to the bank every day)
and in 6 months you will have to
your credit, $18.25, in one year,
$36.77; in 5 years, $195.20; and
10 years, $421. S5. Keep this up
for 20 years, and you will have a
bank accountof almost $1,100.00.
When you have done this, fig
ure it all over again, assuming
that every time you. get $1C0 you
are going to buy a good bond or
stock which will pay 5 or 6 per
cent and that will have a chance
of increasing in value during
your lifetime.
Business is growing so fast in
this country that there are a
thousand absolutely solid con
cerns whose stock by the natur
al expansion of their business
will double in your active life
time. Don't fool away your nick
els and dimes !
Twenty-Second Convention.
The 22nd annual convention of
the Christian Endeavor Societies
of Pennsylvania will be held in
Harrisburg June 11th to the 14th.
Billy Sunday's famous Chorister,
Homer A. Rodenheaver, of Chi
cago, will have charge of the
musical feature of the program.
There will be an excursion to
Gettysburg from Harrisburg.

JUNE DONOR ROLL.
Names of Ntw Subscribers and Others
Who Have Paid Subscription Dur
ing the Past Mouth.
Another Honor Roll reminds us
that another month has passed,
and this week's issue reminds us
that we have started on the sec
ond half of the year 1916. Time
flies. Printing the names of
those who pay subscription dur
ing the month is not done merely
to fill up the paper. There is a
reason. The more than ten thou
sand persons who read the Ful
ton County News each week,
belong to one big family. Many
are residents of the County now;
many have been residents; oth
ers are intermarried with ratives
of the county, and are thus
brought into touch with the in
terests of the County. Through
family relationship, or acquaint
anceship, most of the readers
have a personal interest in most
of the other readers. Hence it
is interesting to scan the lift each
month and sec the names of those
you know well, and are perhaps
surprised to find that they like
yourselves, take pleasure in pe
rusing the columns of the News
each woek.
To those who have contributed
toward the support of the paper
during the month we thank you.
It costs lota of hard labor, and
plenty of good money to get the
paper to our subscribers each
week. When our subscribers are
prompt in settling their subscrip
tion, we can manage to get along.
You know how it is, yourself.
When you need money, the money
that somebody owes you does not
help you out. Subscription debts
are always small ones and not
hard to meet.
It is the custom of County
newspapers to continue sending
the paper to subscribers until
they order it discontinued. The
publisher has no wish to send the
paper to any one who does not
want the paper. If you take the
paper from the office it is evi
dence that you want it, and that
you intend to pay for it. The
Court3 have decided that any
person taking the paper from the
postoffice is liable same as any
other debt, and the debt' may be
collected by law. It is not the
wish of the publisher that he
should have to resort to law to
collect subscription debts. If
there is among the readers of
this article any who are taking
the News, who do not wish to re
ceive it; or who do not expect to
pay for it if they can get out of
it, it would certainly be only fair
to spend a cent for a postal card,
and write the editor. It would
only be doing unto others as you
would that they should do to you.
Look over the following list of
people who take the News, who
read it, appreciate it, and PAY
for it.

Motorcycle Accident
Last Saturday evening, a party
o f three passed through this
place on the way west, on a mo
torcycle. A man operated the
machine while one woman road
in a sidecar and another on the
rear seat. Near the David My
ers place, on west side of Scrub
Ridge, the brakes failed to work
and the machine and the three
riders dashed through a fence,
tearing down three panels. James
Sipes brought the party back to
McConnellsburg to Dr. Robin
son's office. The Doctor dressed
a severe cut on top of the man's
head. One of the ladies wa3 cut
about the face, and the other had
one of her lower limbH bruised
and the skin scraped off a large
spot on her thigh. They then
engaged Ira Diehl to take them
to Fort Loudon. The party did
not give their names, but said
they were from Springfield Mass.

Living Out-Doors.
God breathed into his nostrils
the breath of life and man be
came a living soul. Genesis
Air is life; without it man ceas
es to live. Living in impure air,
his health gradually depreciates
and he becomes a dyspeptic, pre
disposed to tuberculosis and oth
er diseases. Often after suffer
ing for years, during which time
he is unable to enjoy the good
things of life, he meets an un
timely death.
In this climate the majority of
us have to work in offices and
buildings artifically heated dur
ing the cold season. Our places
in which we spend so many hours
during the winters and early
spring days are far from having
perfect ventilation. This there
fore, is the reason for us all to
take advantage of mild weather
conditions to get all the fresh air
possible to build our physical
bodies up so as to resist the un
favorable conditions we must
submit to during the cold months
of the year.
This would apply to all ages,
especially including babyhood and
on up to old age. It means out
door living as much as possible
both day and night. When com
pelled to be in buildings keep the
windows up; otherwise you have
dead pockets of air in your rooms
at your homes and place of occu
pation. Clean, well aired, homes built
so as to admit plenty of fresh air
all the year around and out-door
living as much as possible during
the summer, will do much to
bring health to the home and
just in proportion to your health
your life will be worth living.
Thej Had a Picnic.
The Thimble Club, alias Social
Club,' alias Fancy Work Club,
held a genuine picnic on top of
Cove mountain Thursday after
noon of last week. We have it
from reliable authority that one
of our freighters carefully and
tenderly packed the members in
egg crates to take them to the
picnic grounds. Now comes the
sad part they "scrambled" on
the way up, and some of them
are said to have actually split
their sides. Worse and more of
it, when noses were counted on
arrival at the top, one "rooster"
was found, and "believe me" he
hasn't crowed since.
Mrs. J. R. Jackson seems to
have recovered from what was
thought last week to be a threat
ened attack of typhoid fever.
