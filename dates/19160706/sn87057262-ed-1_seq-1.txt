WASHINGTON, July 6.—President
I'CVilson is not convinced all danger
In Mexico is over. The present crisis
has passed. Carranza'B attitude—now
one of co-operation and friendliness
—gives tremendous satisfaction to the
officials. But the border danger still
lives. Three problems are yet to be
BOlved: Withdrawal of the punitive
expedition co-operative border pat
rol cleaning up of northern Mexico
and re-establishing of peace and
order. There are few officials who
do not believe three mouths will see
American troops entirely out of Mex
ico, most militia if not all, back home
.and the border under protection of a
movement will be hastened
fby evidence of -determination shown
by Carranza troops to clean up north
srn Mexico.
Tomorrow the president and his
[cabinet will take up this phase of
[the question. It Is known military
authorities believe there is no further
reason why the punitive expedition
should remain in Mexico—at least

further south than a patrol zone along
(the border itself. It is known, fur

EAGLU PASS, Texas, uly 6.—At
least two million men, women and
children in Mexico are on the verge
of starvation, according to Jose F.
Marrtinez, who arrived here after
traveling two months in the southern
republic to prepare a report on condi
tions for New York Interests.
"Conditions in nearly evefy part of
Mexico are desperate," said Merrtl
nez. "The army has plenty of food,
while the civilian population is desti
tute and there Is no relief In sight.
Many thousand hungry men have en
listed rather than starve to death."
(Martinez said that Mexico is bet
ter prepared for war than generally
supposed, having accumulated mill
ions of rounds of ammunition, Ameri
can made, and large quantities of
rifles in the last year.
(While in Monterey, Martinez had a
narrow escape from death. He was
given an hour to leave the city. He
was lucky in catching a freight train

way to Pledras Negras and Eagle

Villa had 1,200 followers with him,

San Bautesta is thirty-five miles

The heroic death of General Ignacio
Ramos at the head of his Carranzista
soldiers was related in reports stating
that the Villistas thrice were beaten
back from the edge of entrenchments.
Crack regiments of the defacto gov

have been launched on a campaign to
wipe out the Villistas. However, the

TO STEM THE ADVANCE
'British Must'Be Stopped at All Costs
In the'Offenslve Against
the German
Armies.
[By Ed. Li. Keen, United Press Staff
Correspondent.]
LONDON, July 6.—The kaiser is
reported to have arrived on the
Somme front accompanied by mem
bers of his general staff, who will
direct the defense of the German lines
in the great allied offensive.
An Amsterdam dispatch today re
ported the kaiser's arrival and said
he had established headquarters near
the front and not far from Cambrai
and opposite the British front.
Great bodies of German troops are
being massed betwen the Ancre and
the Somme to stem the British ad
vance. Allied flyers report the con
stant arrival of troop trains and Hol
land dispatches today confirmed re
ports of heavy concentrations behind
the British lines from Ypres to the
Somme.
There is every Indication that the
Germans will launch a very heavy
counter attack against the British
lines within seventy-two hours. The
object will be not only to stifle the
British offensive, but to prevent a
further advance by the French, who
cannot continue the drive eastward
if the British lines on their left are
bent back. The German blow may
fall anywhere along the British front.
All dispatches from Berlin today
emphasized the kaiser's determina
tion to halt the British early in the
attack at all costs. The German
newspapers, paying scant attention
to the French success south of the
Somme, express elation over the fact
that the momentum of the British
advance has been checked. The more
sober minded German critics, how
ever, give warning that the battle is
only beginning and that regardless

PARIS, July 6.—Verdun cathedral
was heavily bombarded by the Ger
mans last night with large shells, the
war office announced today.
Though violent bombardments oc
curred on the Verdun front, the Ger
mans did not resume tiidr infantry
attacks.
The Germans bombarded French
second line trenches near Chattan
court, west of the Meuse. On the
east bank artillery duels continued
on the sectors of Fluery and the
Fumin wood.
In Alsace a French detachment
penetrated a trench near Burhaupt
which was found to be full of dead
Germans.
The lull in the fighting south of
the Somme last night was probably
due to the necessity for further artil
lery preparation before the French
resume their advance on Peronne.
Since the French advance south of
the river began last Saturday morn
ing, General Foch's troops faave tak
en the German second lines on a wide
front, but now face new and strong
defensive positions before Peronne.
With French troops now almost in
the outskirts of Peronne, the Ger
mans are reinforcing heavily, par
ticularly on' their right fhtnk, north
west of the village, ©outhwest of
Peronne heavy fighting occurred yes

part and the famous French "75's"

One cavalry detachment, breaking
through a gap in the German line,
actually approached close to the
Peronne-Cihaulnes railway, before be
ing driven back by German fire.
So rapid was the French advance
south of the Somme in the early
stages of the fighting that German
detachments were cut ctff during the
night in some instances and sur
rounded before they knew they were
under attack. A FVench company
which cut off the avenues of retreat
from one German trench, found sev

The rebels were entrenched In a

made a sharp attack, soon driving

LINCOLN, Neb., July 6.—While

Most of the militiamen are "boys trcm

Last year the state labor bureau
Issued a call for 7,000 harvest bands
from out of the state. About 6,000
harvesters responded. This year it
will take about the same number to
handle the crop which is considered
excellent. The weather in the early
part of the season prevented too much
growth of stalk and the late rains
worked for good: development of the
