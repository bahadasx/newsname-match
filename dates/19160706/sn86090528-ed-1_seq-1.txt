consultation wtih President Wilson,
it was learned from authoritative
sources that negotiations with Mexico
will be taken up through the custom
ary diplomatic channels. However,

Mexico.

Washington, July ti. The danger in
Mexico is not entirely past despite the
friendly note in which Carranza avows
his willingness to negotiate with the

withdrawal of the punitive expedition,
the co-operaNlve patrol of the border
and the denning up of northern Mex
ico, wiping out the bandit bands that
menace the border.
""""Most of I ho officials here . believe
that the next three months will see
the American troops entirely out ol
Mexico. The greater pact Of the mili
tia will lie back under the protection
of a strong force of regulars.
President Wilson and his cabinet
are expected to take up the Mexican

In a letter to City Attorney Grigsby,
under date of July 5, Boiiil. Melton k
Melton set forth the status of the
Chickasha paving case s follows:
Dear Judge:
You requested that I advise you the
present status of the case of O'Brien,
et al. vs. the City of Chickasha. et al.
involving tne. validity of the paving as
sessments m ' District No. ;i, Chicka
sha, and whether or not the plaintiffs
Intended to appeal the case to the su
preme court of the United Stales. Von
are advised that in June, this year, the
supreme court of the stale of Oklaho
ma rendered its final decision in the
case on re-hearing, reversing the judg
ment of the trial court, which enjoin
ed the collecting of the paving assess
ments, and held that the action brought
by the plaintiffs could not be main
lined to tost, the validity of the as
sessments for the reason that the ac
tion was not filed in the district court
until more llian sixty days alter the
date of the ordinance levying the as
sessments. After this decision was
rendered by the supreme court, an or
der was entered staying t lit; issuance
of the inundate in the cause ponding
application for writ of error by the
plaintiffs to the supreme court of the
United States. Since I his decision, I
have had uo opportunity to consult
Judge Stuart with reference to wheth
er or nut an appeal should bo proptcut
eil to the United States supreme court.
Judge Stuart is now 011 his vacation
and will not return until about t lie mid
dle of July. As soon as he returns, I
shall consult with him. and after con
sultation, the plaintiffs will then de
termine whether or not the appeal will
he prosecuted.
You also make inquiry as to wheth
er or not penalties 011 unpaid assess
ment involved in this litigation are
to be collected ill case no appeal is ta
ken. Upon this question 1 express no
positive opinion, though 1 am inclined
to the belief that no penalties should
rightfully attach while the judgment of
the district court declaring the assess
ments invalid and enjoining their col
lection remained in force and unre
versed. In this fiiinection. you are
adviM d that if for any reason the case
slioeld not be appealed to the supreme
court of the United Slates, or if ap
pealed to the supreme court of the
United Stall's, and the judgment of
the supreme court of Oklahoma af
firmed. I think the plaintiffs should
ak the city council of the City of
Chickasha. ti remit all penalties oil un-p-.i'l
assessments except that which is
uffi i 1 1 1 to pay the principal and in

DROPS ALL RED TAPE
IN DIPLOMATIC DEALS
Concerns Himself Simply With Caring for
Interests of His Country and Aid
ing Stranded Americans Found
in Europe
(By William Philip Sirnma,
(United Press Staft Correspondent.)
Petrograd, June 6. (By mail.) Da
vid U. Francis, former governor of
Missouri, now new American ambassa
dor to Russia, has solved the riddle of
Why an American is an Embassy? In
cidentally ho is a hit. And they ay
ho Is doing it by being a plain Amer
ican. "I don't pretend to be a diplomat,"
ex-Governor Myron T. Hervick rcnisr'i-
ed shortly after he had been named
ambassador to Franco, "I am juat a
plain American sent here by the Amer
ican government to look after the in -lerests
of the American people, and
.hat is what 1 am going to do to tho
very best of my ability."
This Herrick did. When the war
mrst on Europe like a thunderbolt h
cut red tape right and left and figura
tively went at things lu his -shirt
sleeves, lie assisted Americans in
nlain. effective, straightforward ways,
Vnd he made the biggest hit with tho
French, high and low, ot any ambas
sador tiince Franklin.
From what Ame:,'.eans here nay Da
vid R. Francis bids fair to duplicate
Herrlelt's nurceas, and in much thi
amn way. Ha has turned tho Amcri
an fihbiiHsy at No. 34 Furshtatskaya
into an open house for Americans. 'The
Yankee abroad does not have to bring
letters from prominent politiclaua at
iome to gain admittance. He 'does
lot feel like an intruder when he call3.
The place is a bee-hive for work yet
uo secretary is too busy to be pleas
ant. Nobody smirks but neither does
my body glare when a visitor appears
ut the door. There ia neither fawning
nor frowuitiK, neither nervility nor
duckuplshnesa the entire atrttojphere
of the place is ouo ot plain, siiupla
Americaniiiiii.
"Going to be Ioiig tn Petrograd?
Drop around when you feel like it.
Come and read the Ann rican papers.
Don't need to ask for anybody. Maka
yourself at home."
That Is the kind of thing the Amer
icans encounter at No. 21 Furshtat
saya now. Nor is It exceptional. If
one wishes to see the "governor" as
ho la already called herewhich in it
self says considerable he can be seen
without interminable waits. If he i3
busy in bis private, office a secretary
will eay quite frankly:.
"The governor ia talking to the own
