Washington, D. C The Hay bill
appropriating $2,000,000 for depend'

called or drafted in the present emerg

day. The bill, which now goes to the
senate, allows not exceeding $50 a
month to the dependent families in the
discretion of the secretary of war.
No measure before the senate in
months has arrayed the radicals
against the conservativies so clearly as
the Hay militia draft bill, or rather
the $50 a month .pension provision of
that resolution which was defeated in
the senate by a vote of 45 to SO at its
first appearance. The 30 senators who
voted to pay the families of National
guardsmen $50 a month during the
time the volunteers are on the border
or in Mexico were, with two excep

of the senate. Senator Culberson, of
Texas, and Senator Walsh of Montana,
were the two senators out of their
class.

ment of fresh meat intended for the
commissary was burned in the de
struction of the butcher shop. Pharr

K, Tenth Cavalry, who was brought in
to Juarez from Villa Ahumada and

the Mexicans fired the first shots of

Fire Loss $100,000,'at Banks.
Banks Fully a milllon'feet of turn-
ber were lost In the firejwhich'de
stroyed the mill of the Eccles Lumber
company Saturday, and an estimate of
the loss is placed at fully $100,000 by
officials of the company.
Whether or not the mill will be re
built has not been decided. M. H. Ec
cles, of Baker, owner of the mill,
expected here thia week, when a de
cision may be announced.
The mill waa insured, but officials
were unable to say to what extent.
The mill was new and had been in
operation only a few months. Shortly
after completion nearly two years ago,
it closed down after operating a few
weeks and operations were not re
sumed until this spring. In the mean
time a planer was added. The plant
was equipped with the latest and most
modern machinery.
How the fire started is a mystery,
It waa first observed about the center
of the mill, and before any steps could
be taken to check the flames, it had
spread throughout the entire mill.
I he bccles Lumber company owns
several mills in the state. This is thrf
second loss they have sustained within
a few months. Last winter their prin
cipal mill at Baker was destroyed, but
has been rebuilt.

attention of Glenn Shockley, a member
of the fraternity, who went to the
boy'a rescue.

Busk, of the university. ' He bad fallen
from the Alder-street bridge, and, be
ing unable to swim, was carried down
stream about 60 feet before being res

and but for the dog's conduct the boy
probably would have perished.
Arguments to Come High.
Salem It will cost about $55 a page
for all arguments submitted in favor
of or against any initiative measures
to be placed before the voters of the
state in the November election, ac
cording to Secretary of State Olcott.
It ia impossible to say just what the
size and extent of the pamphlet will
be, or how many will be printed. The
registration in 1914 was about 305,
000, while the registration before the
primary waa about 230,000. This year
the registration before the primary
ran about 260,000, and it is expected
the final figure will show a correspond
ing increase. One pamphlet is sent
to each registered voter.
Lumbermen May Meet.
Klamath Falls Plans are now under
way for a convention of the California
White and Sugar Manufacturers asso
ciation here in August. Harold D,
Mortenson, President of the Pelican
Lumber company of this city, has
charge of the arrangements for this
meeting.
During the first week of August,
the White Pine Manufacutrers associa
tion of Spokane, will hold its annual
convention at Bend, Ore. As this
meeting will be attended by all pine
lumbermen of the Inland Empire, the
two organizations may meet here to
gether to talk and formulate plans for
better grading and market conditions,

Big Drive by Allied Powers Begun
On All Sides of Central Powers
London At last the long-heralded
and much-delayed grand offensive of
the allies seems to be at hand. If
events rather than official annour
ments mark its opening, it is already
well under way.
Paris and London nave said nothing
regarding the important operation de
veloping. It has been left to admis
sions from the central powers to es
tablish their existence.
Thus as against the silence of the
British war office, Berlin chronicled
the opening of "important battles" in
the sector held by Sir Douglas Haig.
Vienna supplements this with the
admission of a 20-mile retirement in
the Trentino. "To retain our freedom
of action," is the tribute the Austrian
war office pays to General Cadorna'a
offensive, which observers expect to
spread rapdily to Isonzo front.
In the east, the Russians, while still
held up in their advance on Kovel by
the Germans, are continuing their ad
vance against the Austriana in the
south. Their flank now protected by
the Carpathians, they have turned
northward in their sweep through Bu
kowina and are now approaching Ko
lomea. They are already within 10
miles of the town.
Thus, though the Germans succeed
in preventing the progress from the
north, the Russians may still force the
evacuation of Lemburg and Tarnapol
by advancing from the south. Similar
tactics were successful when the Rus
sians took the city before.
General Brusiloff's main efforts are
now being diverted to overthrowing
the Germans in these positions. He
has brought his batteries which routed
the Austriana, to bear here.

ongress to Allow $28,000,000
for Increased National Guard
Washington, D. C. Nearly $28,
000.000 exclusively for the national
guard is carried in, the army appropri
ation bill which haa been reported to
the house and is now on the calendar.
In recent years the United States has
contributed about $6,000,000 a year to
the support of the national guard,
chiefly in the matter of material fur
nished. . The states individually have
expended on the national guard an ag
gregate of about $7,720,000 a year
The tremendous increase in the
amount to be expended by the national
government on the service is due to

No Change in Policy Toward Mexico
Contemplated by Wilson-Offer
to Protect Border likely.
Washington, D. C While adminis
tration officials manifested impatience
Saturday over the delay of the Car
ranza government in replying to the
American demand for an explanation
of its purposes, private advices from
Mexico City indicated that a defiant
answer was being prepared there.
The State department has had no di
rect information as to when the Mexi-
ii response would be sent or how it
would be transmitted. Secretary Lan
sing called this fact to the attention
of Eliseo Arredondo, Mexican ambas
sador designate, during the day and in
dicated that he did not understand the
delay, in view of the statement in the
American note of last Saturday that
an early answer waa expected.
Mr. Arredondo, who had called to
announce formally the release of the
Carrizal prisoners, said he had not
heard from his government on the sub
ject 'W .
The private messages, sent by per
sons in a position to speak with some
authority as to General Carranza'a at
titude, expressed the conviction that a
break between the two governments
waa unavoidable. There appeared to
be complete agreement among mem
bers of the Mexican cabinet, it was in
dicated, that orders to General Trevino
to attack American troops moving in
any direction except toward the bor
der be reaffirmed. Some de facto offi
cials wished to go further and couple
with thia statement in the Mexican
reply a defiant demand that American
troops be withdrawn immediately from
Mexican soil.
Intimation have reached officials
here that the de facto govenment may
give strong assurances in its note that
border raids will be prevented by a
strong patrol of Mexican troops, if the
United States will withdraw its forces.
It was said at the Mexican embassy
that 50,000 Carranza troops are now
available for border patrol duty.
The cabinet had no official advices
in any way changing the situation
when it assembled at a regular meet
ing. The crisis waa discussed and
later it waa stated that no change in
policy waa contemplated.
fire Destroys U. S.
Dock and Warehouse at Seattle
Seattle, Wash. Fire that was dis
covered at 11 o'clock Friday night on
Pier 11, known generally aa the Orien
tal dock, at the foot of Virginia street,
destroyed the pier and its warehouse,
which was occupied by the United
States army quartermaster's depart
ment and W. F. Jahn & Co., dealers in
building material, hay and grain.
Large quantities of army supplies in
the warehouse were destroyed. The
burning of cartridges and shells caused
a succession of rattling explosions. .
An unidentified boy about 11 years
old, standing in front of the state arm
ory on top of a bluff a block distant,
watching the fire, was struck by a
fragment of a bursting shell and in
stantly killed.
The financial loss of the fire is esti
mated at $500,000.
The United States cable repair
steamer Burnside was at the pier when
the fire broke out, but was taken out
into the stream by her crew before
much damage was done. Her upper
works were slightly scorched.
The fire burned with extraordinary
fury and the firemen were able only to
save the adjoining piers and the ware
houses to the rear of the burning
structure.
Battle In. Baltic Sea.
Berlin An official statement issued
by the German admiralty says:
"Thursday night German torpedo
boats attacked Russian forces consist
ing of an armored cruiser, a protected
cruiser and five destroyers, between
Havringe and Landsort (islands in the
Baltic Sea off Soderman Land, Swe
den). After a short engagement the
Russians witdrew. Despite a heavy
bombardment we sustained no casual
ties nor damage."
