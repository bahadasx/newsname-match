Washington, July Formal accept
ance of General Carranza's proposal
that differences between the United
States and the de facto government of
(Mexico be settled by direct negotiations
will be dispatched soon to Mexioo City.
This was decided by President Wil
*", son today at a conference with Secre
L. tary Lansing.

io iuciulativii
^Secretary 'Lansing will leave tomor
row for a month's vacation. It was not
Cr- itated today whether he would prepare
the reply to Mexico before his depart
ure, but indications are that it will go
forward in a day or two at most.
Chance For Hitch.
&v Altho General Carranza's note has
jga, greatly eased tension, no official was
willing today to prediot the- final out
come of the negotiations which are
foreshadowed. It was made plain that
the immediate withdrawal of General
Pershing's forces from Mexico will not
be acceptable basis for whatever plan
of co-operative action along the border
is worked out.
Washington officials take the position
that oply the preliminary step has
been tauten by General Carranza toward
thelrieodly adjustment he now appears
to desire. DemonstratlonoX his ability
.. .4®.ysajriTr'?in»t -the promise* expressed
Implied in hia note is still making.
The. efficiency of Mexican police
methods may soon be put to a severe
test, according to rumors from the bor
der. These state that Francisco Villa
has recovered from his wounds and is'
leading a force north from the region
of Parral.
Border Patrol Endorsed.
Carranza's suggestion for a plan of
"cantonments" along the border line,
which is revived in the note, was
threshed oat at the Scott-Obregon con
ference, it is explained, and was con
sidered practical by representatives of
both governments., But this idea, like
many others suggested at the confer
ence, was linked with the question* of
Wfr whether General Pershing's expedition
ary force should remain in Mexico
while the border patrol scheme was be
ing worked out, or should retire to the
border pending the consummation of
the plan. Toe United States stood Arm
for the maintenance of General Per
shing's force in its position, while Car*
ranza insisted upon tis withdrawal. The
joint plan of boundary patrol there
fore reached a deadlock as a cqpse
quence.
Now, however, the pinn is regarded
by officials nertf as likely to prove a
practical solution.
Neutral ZoAe Idea.
It would mean, in effect, the estab
lishment of American and Mexican mil
itary camps along the border or in a
zone contiguous to the border, having
as a common object the prevention of
the formation of bandit bands and the
dispersing of any raiders who might
threaten American cities along the line.
.It is painted out that with 130,
000 militia troops along the border,
in addition to the Mexican regular
riroop* stationed in the vicinity, the
chances of bandit raids would be neg
ligible. The avowed poller of the
United States in aending troops to the
border id explained to be the protection
of American interest* there, and it is
understood uiat any practical plan to
accomplish this object will be given
friendly consideration by President
Wilson.
It is not regarded- as likely that the?
lessening'of the tension in the Mexican
crisis will have an effect on the mobil
isation of the national guard. Officials
say that even with the best efforts of
the C&rransa government it will be
some time Before conHitions in north
ern (Mexico are anywhere near normal.
And in the. meantime, they say, the
danger of trouble in northern Mexico
will be continually present, and the op
portunity for eliminating once and for
all the possibility of a recurrence of the
Columbus raid will be taken advantage
Officials say, however, that Carranza
will be given formal assurances that
the mobilization of the militia on the
border is in ho sense to be construed
•a anythfhg but. a protective measure
to safeguard American lives and prop
erty on the border.
Trevino Not Mentioned.
Carranza's note does not make any
specific explanation of the orders given
to General Trevino which were respon
sible for the Carrizal clash and an ex
planation- of which was demanded b(y
Secretary Lansing. The Mexican flrst
chief was in fact'informed that the or
der/to attack General Pershing's men
if tfiey moved east, south, or west in
Mexico was construed here as an act
of deliberate hostility. But the decla
ration by the Carranza government
that It will seek eve^y means to avoid
it
.it-.
uatlon is regarded here as virtual with
drawal of the order.
It is not believed, that Secretary Lan
sing -will press this point, especially as
the other features of the note so clear
ly indicate a desire to come to an
amicable understanding with thi
United States.
Arredondo Confident.
Eliseo Aj/edondo, the Mexican am
-bassador designate, is understood to
regard that note as eliminating all
cause of friptlon and promising a
speedy return to the same amicable
diplomatic relations which character
ized the negotiations of the two gov
ernments prior to the Villa raid last
March.
"The note speaks for itself," he said.
"It is thoroughly explanatory and sets
fortl\ exactly the situation with the
United State's as viewed by the Mexi
can government."
Copies of the note were sent by Mr.
Arredondo to all the embassies and
legations in Washington, particularly
to the Latin-American diplomats who
have sought previously to arrange for
a settlement of the dispute by medi
ation.
Hold Carranza Wise.
Opinion in Latin-American circles
here Is that Carranza has shown ex
cellent Judgment in meeting the wishes
of the United States half way InsteaJ
of pursuing his defiant attitude.
His condition that the security of!
the American border and the with-1
drawal of the American troops from'
Mexico were the two dominant features
to be settled is endorsed by the diplo
mats of the Latin-American countries,
who are particularly pleased that the

were killed by the terrific
British losses vary. Certain forma
tions, being called on to attack de
fenses where machine guns remained
undamaged, suffered heavily. Others
captured positions with very slight
losses.
Attack on Verdun Undiminished.
Instead of compelling the Germans
to lessen their efforts on Verdun, the
new offensive seemed to have in
creased their determination, possibly
in the hope of preventing the French
from sending reinforcements to the
Somme.
British observers express satisfac
tiontion with the progress made. With
the
taking of l6,000rprisoners and a'
great quantity of waf material, to
gether with the heavy losses inflicted,
it is believed here that the German
power of resistance has been weak
ened.
Von Bothmer's Army Threatened.
The Russians continue to win suc
cesses along their whole front from
Riga to the Carpathians. They have
crossed the river between Delatyn,
west of Kolomea, and Korosmezo, one
of the main lines between Galicla and
Hungary, upon which the Austrians
depend largely to supply their armies
at 'Stanlslau and before Tarndpol. This
places the army of General von Both
mer in a still more dangerous position
and It is thought he may decide to
withdraw toward Lemberg.
In the Lutsk salient, at BaranivichI,
and along the Riga front, the Russians
also claim to be making progress.
German correspondents express the
opinion that General Kuropatkin is
preparing an offensive in the VUna
region.
Turkish Raider Visits Sotchy.
Dispatches from Sotchy, a Russian
port on the Black sea, forwarded from,
Petrograd by Reuters, says that the
former German cruiser" Breslau, now
renamed the Medullu, in the Turkish
naval service, approached Sotchy sev
eral evenings ago, flying the Russian
flag. Subsequently she hoisted the
Turkish flag, torpedoed a transport
loaded with supplies, and sank a sail
ing vessel.
Off Vardar she completed the de
struction of a transport^ torpedoed the
previous day by a Turkish submarine.
Advance on -Somme Front.
"Near Thiepval, on the 'Somirie front,
we made a further slight advance,
apd captured a number of prisoners,"
the war office announced today.
"South of the LeBasse canal, after the
discharge of gas and smoke we made
some successful raids into the enemy's
flrst line.
"In another raid the Highland Light
Infantry successfully entered the
enemy's trenches west of Hulluch. A
machine gun was destroyed, many
Germans were killed and some prison
ers were taken."
Revival of Submarine Activity.
There has been a revival of Ger
man submarine activity during the
last few days. Three British fishing
boats have been sunk in the North sea.
All the crews were allowed to leave
the boats except in one case, where
the skipper was killed. It l« officially
announced that a 'British mine sweeper
was hit by a torpedo in,the North sea
and damaged.
A report from Christiania says a
German submarine yesterday attacked
the Norwegian steamer Petronelle off
Farsund, the submarine firing three
fhots without damaging the steamer.
PR6NGH CONTINUE ADVANCE.
In the flrst five days of their tiattle
against the Germans, the French have
advanced yrlth distinctive uniformity.'
French are now firmly installed be
tween the German second and third
lines of defense over a front In excess
of seven miles.
That the Ifrench losses have
have
comparatively insignificant Is Indicat
ed by the maintenance on the front
line of the flrst two army corps that
made their first assault on German po
sitions last Saturday morning.
One of theseficorps distinguished it
self before Vefilun in .February after
having won laurels at the battle of the
Marne.
The other corps comprises ohiefly
colonial troops. The generals of the
oorps were again congratulated today
by General Foche.
French Before St. Quentin.
The French are now in front of the
village of Mount St. Quentin, situated
on an elevation 300 feet from the point
of which, in 1870, the Germans bom
barded Parron.
The German second positions had
been so demolished that they were un
able to make a strong resistance ex
cept at the village at Hem, which had
been fortified. By. hard fighting the
village was won as well as Monaeu
farm, to the southwest.
Last night was generally quiet north
and south of: the river Somme, says
today's official statement of the war
office.
There were a few local engagements
north of the Somme during the night,
during which the Germans captured
two small woods north of Hem. The
French also captuted a wood.

In Juarez the event was scarcely not

Indifference in Juarez was explainable
in the fact that the special train did
not arrive there from Villa Ahumada
until late last night. Before the town
was well awake an engine detached
the car containing the dead and pushed
