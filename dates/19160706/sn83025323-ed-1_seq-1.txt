\Vi; promised to be one of the
best all games of the season last
Sundai on the local diamond re
nmains unfinished on account of de
vcisions of the visiting umpire that
wai tiought by the Malta players to
be ututir. The Dodson boys started
off with a grand rush and during
thl ,ute succeeded in putting five
m1-i acr>iss the home ulate. The vis
itors were very successful in placing
hits and the home boys were just
as unsuccessful in theirs.
In the eighth inning the home
boys secured two scores and in the
ninth had two men on bases when
the umpire gave a close decision on
first io Dodson, as he had on several
occasions during tie game. People
do not care to go to a ball game to
see it break up over a bum decision
and neither do they want to see eith
er team get the worst of it. Base
ball is a sport and we want to see
the best team win regardless of'
wthere they were frora. The umpire
front Diodsont Dwight Jones, has ali
Wt)i borne the reputation for bteing
on1', of the lsti of men for the po
iiitt in the valley. and while we do
not think lie intended to give the
Mtilta boys the worst of the deal lie
gav - -everal decisions that were very .
close, oilt would have made a differ- t
ence in the result of the game, Nt o
one cmin blame the home teant in lIth
leteit fur refusing to finish the game. «
It i to le hoped the next time lith
two teants get together there will iei
no caus-i t-or trouble.
