the legal amount of liquor in their
possession and orders the return to
them of several thousand dollars'
worth of wines seized by the sheriff

The decision held that the provision

Father Spent evening -in
Bosom of His Family."
Half a dozen words lisped by a 4-year-old
girl lifted a Topeka father
out from a web that was being woven
around him by a detective and offi
cials of this and Pottawatomie county.
With the half a dozen words she
made it unnecessary for him to prove
that he had no part in the robbery of
the St. Mary's State bank Tuesday
night.
The father had been picked up by
local officials and given a "sweating"
in the sheriff's office. He had been
required to tell in detail all his move-
, Monday last. His story
was fixed in the memory of five men
who heard it.
Then they left the man under guard
and drove to his home, out in a lone-
SQme suburo. Hi3 wife was at home.
She was startled by the sudden ap
pearance of so many men, but she
answered all questions. She told much
the same story as her husband, but on
some points there were variations.
The imported detective was pleased.
He thought he was getting somewhere.

But the detective was not satisfied.
The woman had tripped on a question
asked earlier and he had doubts of
her story. , ,
"Where is your little girl?" he
asked.
"Why she's sleeping," said the
mother.
"Wake her up."
"She's so tired and it's so hot I hate
to wake her.
"Wake her up and let's talk to her."
The mother went into the bedroom
and roused the child from a sound

He told the commission he was not
in favor of allowing the bill, as what
the league is accomplishing is not
worth the amount.
Commissioner Wasson addressed the
mayor.
"Tou paid my expenses to the meet

it seriously if you received in return
anything like the cost of the trip."
Commissioner Porter was also sent
to the last meeting and was elected

He was out of town today.

idea of this league. I understand, is
to secure legislation wanted. I will

London, July 6. The kaiser is re
ported to have arrived on the Somme
front accompanied by members of his
general staff, who will direct the. de
fense of the German lines in the great
allied offensive.
An Amsterdam dispatch today re
ported the kaiser's arrival and said he
had established headquarters near the
front and not far from Cambrai and
opposite the British front.
Great bodies of German troops are
being massed between the Ancre and
the Somme to stem the British ad
vance. Allied flyers report the con
stant arrival of troop trains and Hol
land dispatches today confirmed re
ports of heavy concentrations behind
the British lines from Tpres to the
Somme.
Concentrate Force on British.
" There is every indication that the
Germans will launch a very heavy
counter-attack against the British
lines within seventy-two hours. The
object will be not only to stifle the
British offensive but to prevent a fur
ther advance by the French, who can
not continue the drive eastward if the
British lines on their left are bent
back. The German blow may fall
anywhere along the British front.
All dispatches from Berlin today
emphasized the kaiser's determination
to halt the British early in the attack
at all costs. The German newspapers,
paying scant attention to the French
successes south of the Somme. express
elation over the fact thf the momen
tum of the British advance has been
checked. The more sober-minded
German critics, however, give warning
that the battle is only beginning and
that regardless of any checks admin
istered to the allies, the attack will
continue.

Petrograd, July 6. At least a half
million Austrian troops have been
killed, captured or badly wounded
since General Brusiloff began his
sweep through Volyhana, Galicia and
Bukowina. That number will be un
available for the summer and fall
campaigns of the central powers. Gen
eral Letchitzky's advance in south
eastern Galicia, after the capture of
Kolmea has been so rapid that his
army not only menaces the important
cities of Stanislau, but Lemberg and
the whole of eastern Galicia. The
right wing of the Austro-German army
is under heavy pressure.
Austrlans Stagger Back.
The Austrlans are staggering back
along the muddy valleys of the Pruth
and Dniester, abandoning great quan

region, always bad, have been con

one killed, one seriously wounded and
seven slightly hurt.
The dead American was George F.

Pembleton engaged the rebels at
Guayacanes.
The engagement which evidently
immediately preceded the peace nego
tiations in which Admiral Caperton
yesterday informed the department
the revolutionists had agreed to dis
arm, occurred in the interior of Guay

strongly entrenched and concealed in
a position which prevented advance
artillery fire. The enemy outpost
opened the firing. Admiral Caperton
stated.
The fight reported today was the
fourth between United States marines
and revolutionists in about a week.
Officials believe that the complete re

encounter influenced their leader- to

Tomorrow the Dresident ami him
cabinet will take up this phase of the
question. It is known the military
authorities believe there is no further
reason why the punitive expedition
should remain in Mexico at least
further south than a patrol zone along
the border Itself. It is known further
that these authorities feel it would
be unnecessary and impractical to re

ganizations on the international line
for patrol duty longer than three or
four months at the most or not so
long if the situation continues to clear.
The army probably will ask for
