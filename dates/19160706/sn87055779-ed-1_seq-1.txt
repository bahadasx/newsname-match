Attorneys and Chemists in
Battle on Question Whether
Cyanide Which Killed Girl
Was Liquid or Powder.
DEFENSE EXPERT SAYS
IT WAS IN SOLUTION
Prosecutors Impugn Motives
of Expert and Bitter Clash
Between Counsel
Follows.
I utt-riiational Newt S rvbe .
WAUKEGAX. HI-. July '. The
court room in which Will Orpet is
being tried for the murder of Mari
an Lambert was turned into a labor
atory toclay while experts and attor
neys engaged in a general battle
with formulas and chemical terms
for weapons. All during the fore
noon session, attorneys for the state
endeavored unsuccessfully to break
down the expert testimony of Dr.
John A. Wesener that the cyanide
which caused the girl's deatli was
In powdtr form.
The tight waged especially fiercely
around the three spots which were
found or Marian Lambert's green
coat, wh.cli she wore to her death
in Helm' woods. Toxicologists have
testified that the spots were caused
by cyanide of potassium. but
whether the spots were made by
powder er litjuid is a mooted ques
tion. The defense had staunchly
contended that the girl herself took
the poibon in powder form; the
state that Orpet gave her a bot
tle of liquid cyanide.
Deals Blow to State.
Ir. Wesener also dealt the fctate
a blow bj testifying that the cyanide
which was found in the dead girl's
hand could not have come from
the Orptt greenhouse because it
tested a higher percentage than sam
ples which have since been taken
from the greenhouse.
Bitter clashes between the wit
nesses, the state's and the defense's
Attorneys marked the progress of the
questionir g. The state impugned
th motives of Dr. Wesener in testi
fying as he did, which brouuht hot
replies and objections from rpet's
counsel. Summed up. Dr. Wesener's
testimony was as follows:
The cyanide, if in solution form,
would have showed no trace of cy
anogen at the end of four weeks.
IitM.s Ixmger In I'owtlcr.
In powder form the poison prop
erties would have lasted a longer
time.
Therefore, .since the spots on the
coat still held traces of the poison
on June 1." four months after the
girl's death they must have been
in powder form .or they must have
been put there since the body was
found.
Following Dr. Wesener on the
stand was Dr. William . Krohn. an-!
other nflis-nn rvrert f
He testified at length, under direr t
examination, i oneerning hysteria,
nervous d;seases and kindred ail
ments as they affect oung person.
Through his testimony the defense
expected to show that Marian Iam
bert was in a state of hysteria at
the time f her death and being in
such a condition wis susceptible to

of Mrs. W. S. Porter. The engage
ment was announced by the bride's
mother, but Miss Coleman found
that the announcement had placed
her in an embarrassing position.
Mis. Lichtenberger, it is said,
knowing her daughter's perfereni e
lot" young Porter, caused the an
nouncement to be made and pub
lished. Friends of Miss Coleman
were preparing to write h-r noted
of felicitation.
Young P'-rter came to Mi.-s Cole
man's rescue, suggesting that they
be married, leaving the Fish be
trothal to take care of itself. A
civil marriage was performed, fol
lowing which the groom's mother
insisted that the ceremony in ac
cordance with the rates of the
Catholic church take place. This
made the marriage Knot doubly
tied.
Fish, it is further stated, came to
California about a month ago to
marry Miss Coleman, but the sud
den matrimonial adventure of his
betrothed put an end to the affair.
Young Mr. Fish's father is the
president of the Studebaker corpor
