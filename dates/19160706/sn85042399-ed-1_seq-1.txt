hurried ahead by automobile. His
health has been poor lately and un
der doctor's orders he will remain
for several days in Ashland, drinking
llthla water and enjoying our perfect
July weather. W. F. Herrln, general
counsel and a vice-president of the
Southern Pacific and a former Ash
land boy, arrived late last night, an
automobile accident preventing him
from getting here for the dedication
ceremony. He will be here for sev
eral days. President Sproule sent
his regrets, being called to New York
on business that could not wait after
he had made all arrangements to
spend the celebration period here.
The Southern Pacific is now ac
tively advertising the week-end rates
to Ashland and Is taking up a wide
advertising campaign of Ashland.
Notes of the
Chautauqua
Chautauqua Park is filling up.
Most of the campers had their tents
up before th- Fourth, and how fuity
more are going up today and more
are coming in tomorrow. Chautau
qua Park will be overflowing 'and
many campers will no doubt camp at
the auto camp. The largest number
of tents are up that have even been
erected for Chautauqua and the
crowds will be record 'breakers.
Don't miss the big valley choral
entertainment, hundreds of voices,
tomorrow night.
Washington Boys
On Way to Border
Several troop trains passed
through yesterday carrying the
Washington militia. According to
one of the militiamen, the entire
third regiment passed through. One
pain was loaded more heavily than
any which have gone through yet,
having 32 cars. One train carried
machine guns. In view of the peace
ful aspect of things along the border,
likelihood of the local hoys having
to go is diminishing. While the
Washington troops were In Ashland
they marched up through the streets
and were received with cheers every
where by the celebration crowds.
Mrs. A. C. Harbort and little boy
arrived Tuesday from Los Angeles
and will rent a home for the summer.
Mrs. Harbort's sister, Mrs. John
Farmer, and Mr. Farmer are due to
arrive ln the next few days and will
build a home on property which they
own here.
Schools will start Friday morning.
Prof. Larimore Is here with his two
daughters and will make things live
ly for the little folks. A great pro
gram has been provided for both
young and old, and there will be
something doing morning, afternoon
and evening. The morning classes
will be of unusual variety and Inter
est.

dence. There has been "something
doing every minute" from morning
to well, almost morning again. En
tertainment of a crowd of between
25,000 and 30,000 people in a city of
Ashland's size is an immense prob
lem, and the manner In which the
entertainment was so successfully ac
complished stands as a monument to
the committees' and sub-committees'
ability and co-operation. But .the
success of the celebration is due in
the main to the co-operation of
everybody in Ashland and shows the
power of co-operation.
As to results: John M. Scott, who
Is an experienced man at estimating
crowds, having much to do with vast
throngs in his capacity of general
passenger agent for the Southern Pa
cific, asserts privately that his est!
mate of the crowd ln Ashland on July
4 was 32.000, and publicly and unre
servedly estimates the crowd at 30,-
000. This means that between 20,000
and 25,000 outsiders saw Ashland
park and drank lithia water on the
one day alone. Which also means
that almost all of them will be un
able to resist the call of Ashland's
attrctlcas and will be back time and
time again. Financially the city is
benefited by between $150,000 and
$200,000 in good hard cash. And
right here let us stop to say that the
roundup instead of taking money out
of town, as predicted by some, left
practically all that was taken in right
here with Ashland merchants, and
the summer salaries of several score
of cowboys as well. The psychologi
cal effect on Ashland is perhaps the
result which will count the most. A
success, immense crowds, the celebra
tion spirit, have raised Ashland out
of a state of seml-letharev and
brought realization to some extent of
the possibilities that lie before Ash
land in making every day ln the sum
mer season a celebration on a smaller
scale which will attract crowds all
of the time.

Fireworks (iorgeouN,
The most gorgeous and, at the
same time, the most beautiful display
ever seen In Ashland was given by
the Hltt Fireworks Company on
Granite street above the lake ln
Lithia Park on the evening of the
Fourth. At 9 o'clock everyone was
startled by the report of a cannon
and immediately after by another re
port and a flash like that of light
ning. Everyone thought the flash
queer; they had seen no light ut the
place ln which the gun was fired be
fore. The cannon went off again just
then and those who looked up were
enlightened as to the cause of the
flash and were also almost blinded
by the light made by the bursting of
a bomb shout out of the cannon. Sev
eral shots of this kind were fired,
some of them bursting with white
light, some with green, some with all
the rest of the colors of the spectrum
separated and mixed. A man with a
torch next started along the street.
When he had gone about a block a
row of fires were burning white. In
a moment the tires loucnea on at
first began to turn green, and they
all followed suit, dying out a red hue.
Then followed rockets, dancing fig
ures, an American flag, two monster
pinwheels. a Hthia fountain, a design
on which' beiow a bottle the words
"Ashland, Lithia Springs" were em
blazoned, and out of which a foun
tain of fire shot, more gun shots and
more fixed designs, all of which beg
gared description. The same effects 'for UiU gift.
were produced that the people mar
veled at at the exposition, the only
difference being that this display had
different features. No such rockets
were ever turned loose in the sky in
Ashland or vicinity before. Rockets
exploded two or three times instead
of once as ordinary ones do, and
every explosion produced a new color
or effect. Some of them strewed
handfuls of diamonds to the four
winds, some of them burst in many-
armed starfish effects, some of them
went up like comets, and others burst
into many small comets. The man
with the torch, touched off myriads
of Roman candles at one time which
crossed and recrossed in the sky, pro
ducing an effect which was beyond
expression. The crowd that collected
at the report of the cannon was the
largest ever gathered together in
southern Oregon or northern Califor-
Great Choral
Program Friday
Next Friday, the 7th of July, Chau
tauqua opens with a Rogue River
valley musical day. The choruses
of Medford and Ashland have been
rehearsing for some months past
with a view of uniting the singers of
the two towns into one large chorus.
A joint rehearsal of the two ruualo
clubs was held at Medford last Tues
day night, In which a hundred sing
ers and an orchestra of twenty pieces
were brought together.
It has been the desire of George
Andrews of Medford, since opening
his studio last winter, not only to
Improve the singers In Individual
solo work, but to build up an Interest
In choral work in the entire com
munity from Ashland to Grants Pass.
He Is much encouraged with his In
itial efforts and hopes by another
year to be able to bring together 250
voices for a musical convention, on
which occasion some of the best not
ed musreal talent may be engaged
to assist the local societies of tho
valley.
E. C. Root, Carleton Janes and
Harry Howell are doing splendid
work In bringing together their pu
pils to unite in one big orchestra,
and it is their Intention to build this
orchestral organization up to thirty
or forty members, which will be used
not only as an accompaniment for
the chorus, but standard overtures,
and some of the symphonies will bo
taken up. The orchestra Is composed
of musicians from Medford, Talent,
and Ashland.
A picnic dinner has been arranged
state. A large cement basin sur-1 for Friday, at which all the musl
rounds the f ountain and beautiful i clans and singers are to participate.
Memorial Fountain
Presented City
The Butler-Perozzl memorial foun
tain was unveiled and presented to
the city on the evening of the Fourth.
The exercises were opened by a se
lection by the Medford band, after
which II. O. Frohbach, the chairman,
introduced Prof. I. E. Vining, who
delivered the dedicatory address. Lit
tle Luclle Perozzl, assisted by the
flower girls, unveiled the fountain.
During this ceremony the band
played a pastoral selection. Mayor
O. H. Johnson accepted the fountain
ln a short, humorous address, which
with a selection by the band closed
the program.
The fountain Is made of beautiful
Verona marble. The figure Is that of
Cupid playing with a swan. These
words are Inscribed on the fountain:
"Florl di peshl," w hich is the Italian
for "Flower of peaches." The base
is cement and contains some of the',
best cement work ever done in the
and concerts at the pavilion in tho
afternoon and evening.
The program of the afternoon will
be interspersed with solo singing by
Medford singers, also singers from
Giants Tass and Ashland, In fact,
Friday is to be the big musical day
of the Chautauqua, which should re
ceive the encouragement and patron
age of all music-lovers of the valley.

tageously to our beautiful city.
As is natural ln a large undertak
ing, differences of opinion in the
management will sometimes occur,
and I wish to say right here that I
have found Mr. Dodge very firm ln
his convictions, with the public good
always uppermost in his mind. Many
times I have deferred to his opinions,
although holding opposite views my
self, with the result that better serv
ice has been rendered to tho public,
and I have ultimately been able to
see the wisdom of his position.
Mr. Dodge is entitled to his full
share in all the applause and com
mendation which the people of Ash
lnnd and their generous friends and
neighbors have given to the manage
ment in the dedication and general
enjoyment of the fruit of our labors.
Mr. Dodge has spent over thirty-threo
years of his life In thin city. He has
rendered invaluable service to tho
people of this community in the ca
pacity of mayor of the city, member
of the school board and In the promo
tion and execution of many public en
terprises. Mr. Dodge enjoys the full
and loyal confidence of all who know
him and I feel that we should, indi

every opportunity to show Blm our
appreciation and express to him our
thanks for his unselfish devotion to
the public good.
