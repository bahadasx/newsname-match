one kilometer north of Hem. The French also captured a wood.

LONDON, July ti. Having captured the whole German second
list tnuth of the Somme from the river to' Helloy, the French
rammed operations north of the river, clearing the bank almost
to Clery, which was threatening.
Hy Associated Press.)
LONDON, July C. Near Thiepval, on the Somme front, the
British forces made a slight advance, capturing many prisoners.
South of the Labasse canal they made a successful raid on the
enemy's first line.
The same striking feature conies out in an interesting review
of the operations which the Associated Press has obtained in an
interview with Major-General F. B. Maurice, who predicts an
immediate development south of the Somme, where, he says, the
lighting now is in open field formation.
German prisoners are beginning to arrive in England, 1500 being
landed at Southampton today.
In the face of the exciting events on the western front, the
Russian operations to some extent have been lost sight of, but they
are of increasing interest. Reports in the Austrian official com
munications of the fighting southeast of Tlumach indicate that
Gen. von Bothrner's forces must liave fallen back from the Tarnopol
front in an effort to meet the Ihreat of his communication lines.
It is thought that Von Bothmer may be forced to retire to Lemberg.
An attack by laud and sea against Field Marshal von Hinden
burg's forces in the north, together with a new Russian attack at
Baranovichi, promises interesting developments which are likely
to have an influence in the Lutsk region, where the Germans hitherto
have been able to liold the Russians.

"I carry no Insurance and I am
