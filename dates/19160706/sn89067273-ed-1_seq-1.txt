LETTER FROM
GGLORADO
The Crops in Kansas Beautiful and
Cleanly Colorado Springs Miss
Real's Wedding.
"Colorado Springs, Colo., July 1.
"The Message family arrived here
Thursday noon. We left Kansas
City at 6; 30 a. m., Wednesday stick
ing to the same coach till we reached
Llmon, Colo. ,
"Near daylight, we had reached
the western border .of Kansas. The
wheat crop in Western Kansas is
immense. Thousands and thousands
of acres in certain localities are own
ed by one man. One wheat King
told us he had 200 men in his har
vest last year.
"As you enter into Colorado the
lands appear less and less useful for
growing crops. The trouble is the
lack of rainfall.
"Scores of miles before you reach
Colorado Springs, the earth appears
parched and vegetation is stunted.
If1 irrigation could be made practical
here all would be well.
"Here at the Springs it seems to
try to rain about every afternoon, but
the clouds bump up against Pike's
Peak and the high mountain ranges
and the rain fails to get over onto
the plains.
"Colorado Springs is quite a city.
It has a population of 28,000. It
has nothing to eat of Its own; every
thing has to be shipped in except
wheat, which is. growa by irrigation.
The irrigation is very limited.
"The city is one of the cleanest we
have ever been in. They go a step
farther than they do in Mexico you
must not only refrain from spitting
on (lie sidewalks but you must not
spit over the curbing into the Btreet.
Carry your handkerchief. They build
ash pits to get rid of old rubbish in
the back lot. They don't burn old
papers and such In the open, allow
ing the ashes to rise up and fall over
ycir neighbor's store goods the next
door.
"The great attraction in the moun
tains, Pike's Peak, rolls up into the
sky more than 14,000 feet, only a
few miles away to the west. The
snow drifts in the deep canyons far
above the timber line are easily dis
cernible from one's doorway.
"We have met many Missourians,
but only one sa far, who ever lived,
or remained for any time in Audrain
county. He is Dr. C. E. Richmond,
a very interesting fellow he is, too,
with a fine' practice here. Several
years ago he was a student at Mis
souri Military Academy in Mexico.
He sends warmest regards to his old
instructor, Col. W. D. Fonville.
Dr. Fred C. Zaugg and Miss Zola
Beal were married here Friday eve-
,. ning at 8:00 o'clock, at the home of
the bride's couBin, Mrs. Ora U. Mu
stek, Rev. J. F. Barker, pastor of As
bury Methodist church officiating.
About forty guests were present, rel
. atlves and friends of the bride and
groom. V
The wedding guests were assembled
nn the spacious upper porch of the
Mustek home, which had been at-
; tractively decorated for the occasion.
The bank of greenery, before which
the bride, entering on the arm of
her father, took her place was bo ar
ranged as to have the grand old
Rockies as a background with Pike's
Peak in the distance. The groom with
' the best man, the Rev. R. J. Plump
entered from the opposite doorway.
" The r(ng ceremony was used. After
the cutting of the bride's cake and
serving of the refreshments and a
- ' merry evening the entire party of
guests in autos accompanied: the
couple to their ' new home at 1102
'. Colorado Avenue.

WOODCRAFT STORIES
FOR LITTLE CHILDREN
Thirteenth Story
By L. Roy Ferris.
"What's the matter, Fatty Bear?" said Red Fox as
Fatty Bear sat on a log looking' so sad, just like a hoy who
has the measles and there is a circus in town. Fattv Bear
looked up a little surprised for it was only of late that Red
dy Fox took enough interest in anyone to inquire ahout
their weltare, which shows
were not being thrown away
once in a while, at least that
You know one smile weighs
frowns, and they are lots easier to make.
" hat is the matter.'' again said Red Fox, and he really
meant it. "Well, you see, replied Fatty, it is onlv a short
while before I take mv lorg
you think has happened? The sarvis berries arc a'.! gone,
and Cat Bird and her sisters and brothers and cousins and
aunts have finished the mulberries, and Camp Boy helped
lied Head to get all the fat grubs, and why shouldn t a iel
low feel blue when the wild grapes are all gone. It is more
than I can stand. Besides Brother Coon won't plav with
me any more. He is always
little Brother, they call "Bud," and "
"O, say, Fatty, don't give up. Let's take a walk. I
have something to show you."
So Fatty Bear and Reddy Fox walked along the path.
Everybody seemed happy but Reddy. Hut. yiu knw
happiness is catching, just like whonpingcough. and Fat
ty Bear was soon in a good humor. Red Bird ang a song
about "Pretty Bird, Pretty Bird," and Fatty remarket!,
"Yes, I know it but you needn't brag about it.
They crossed a little stream, followed the path, turned
to the right, climbed a little sloping hill where the woods
were thick, where the rocks were covered with ferns and
moss. And there in the prettiest little place imaginable,
hung two or three large grape vine swings. Just the kind
for boys and girls to swing upon, but nobody knew of the
place but Reddy Fox and Fatty is the first one he ever
told.
.."Now look, Fatty Bear, up in that tall hickory tree,
and how about the one in the oak tree and that ne in the
elm, and that one, and that one?" And what do ...n think
he saw? Just dozens and dozens of large bum lies of l e
grapes. Y nat do you think ot thatr asked Keddy. I
think," replied Fatty, "I think you arc a bully goo. f. !
low. Reddy, and I am sorry for the mean thing-- I h.; e
said about you."
And for once in his life, ReddyFox a re.dlv and
truly happy.
As Fatty Bear walked home in the moonlight he par
sed by the camp and saw a little fellow lying on the ;';vn nd
sobbing as though his heart would break. But then ev
ery fellow gets homesick when night comes when he i-
Bud's age, and sometimes when he is a little bit older.
You know how it is a fellow chases butternfes and hunts
for turtle eggs and just has the best time until it begins
to get dark, and then the cows begin to "moo" way over
on the hill, and the crickets shig in the grass, and the whip-poor-will
keeps on telling you about somebody that's go
ing to "whip-poor-will and Dr. Owl, in the tree above, asked
over and over again, "Who. Who are you?" But a fellow
could stand all that if the little screech owl would just
keep still. It is then that a fellow thinks of mother'-; kis
and a little white bed. Fatty Bear sat looking at the ooy
and he saw something slip up real easy like and cuddle up
in. the boy's lap. And after a little while he heard the
Camp Boy say. "Why bles my heart, if here i-u't iiti'e
Bud and Brother Coon, both sound asleep."
, And Fatty Bear noticed in the moonlight two big
salty tears on Bud's cheek, but the Camp Boy didn't say
r. word about it and you know very well Brother Coon and
Fattv Bear will never tell.
