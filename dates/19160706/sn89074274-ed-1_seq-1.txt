three legged girl, attracted attention,
and Spidore, the spider girl, has every
one asking "Well, how do you think
she does it?" The Ten-in-One mus
eum includes a snake-den, an expert
glassblower, a strong man, a fire-eater
and numerous other attractions that
make it an enjoyable place to spend a
half hour. The minstrel show and
the Mississippi Cabaret were well lik
ed, and the merry-go-round and Ferris
wheel were loaded to capacity at all
times. The shows on the whole were
well worth the admission to them, and
deserve the business they got.
The afternoon fireworks, which were
skillfully engineered by J. A. Biggs,
now of Mandan, were excellent and
much enjoyed. The hit of the after
noon was the Mule Derby—wherein
four mules hitched to bike sulkies
•were raced by Casper Winkler, Billy
Walters, J. A. Biggs and Melvin T.
Lee. We suspect that Walters has
driven mules before, for he came in
first, with Biggs a close second. We
know that Lee isn't on to the psychol
ogy of the mule, but even so he man
aged to beat out Winkler. The race
will be repeated every day with new
drivers.
In the evening -Mr. Biggs again
amused the crowd with a splendid dis
play of fireworks, after which every
one amused himself at the shows or at
Willard Carlson's dance pavilion.
The two races on Tuesday after
noon were all and more than could
be expected when the condition of the
track was considered. Both contests

Paulson Ahead
in Weds County
A. P. Paulson was given a majority
of votes in Wells county at the pri
mary for district judge over Judge J.
A. Coffey. Mr. Paulson had a major
ity in 21 precincts out of the 41 in the
county, while Judge Coffey carried 16,
the other four being a tie. Further,
it is noted that Judge Coffey's vote
came mostly from the organized towns
and precincts which had a town vote,
while the farmer vote, more generally,
went for Paulson.
At the general election in 1912
Judge Coffey received 1,321 votes,
while at the primary just held he re
ceived 663 votes, just about half of
what he got four years ago.

FAVORS ROAD BUDGET
OF HUNDRED MILLION
Washington, July 3. Senator
Nelson's amendment to the good roads
bill providing for 110,000,000 to be
spent in improving roads in national
forest reserves has been agreed to by
the conferees on the good roads bill.
This is specially important to the
two forest reserves in Minnesota, the
Superior forest reserve at Duluth and
the Minnesota reserve at Cass Lake,
as improvement of roads there will
be provided for out of the fund thus
created.
The bill provides that not more than
$1,000,000 can be spent annually in
road improvements for the forest re
serves throughout the country.
The amount that would be spent in
the Minnesota located reserve will be
a matter of administrative detail, to
be decided by the secretary of agri
culture after application is made by
the state and county officials.
Normal Attendance
Reaches Big Figure
More than 600 students registered
the first two days of the summer ses

Students have come from as far as
points in Indiana.
The training school also has a rec
ord enrollment, 125 children in the
grades. A new plan of vacation school
is in vogue less time will be spent in
the classroom, and more on the play

Pioneer day at the Valley City Chau

greatest days of the Chautauqua, in
fact, the committee is of the opinion
that they are going to be able to make
it one of the greatest days ever held
in Barnes county. Much interest is
being manifested in all parts of the
county and many are coming from the
outside. A program unique in its na

will be of such a nature as to appeal
to the old and young, and help the old
to live again the pleasant experiences
of early days. Tell your neighbors to

Mrs. Washington on
Chautauqua Program
The Chautauqua program committee
has received definite information that
Mrs. Booker T. Washington will ap
pear on the program on Thursday,
July 13. This will be welcome news
to the people of Valley City and vi
cinity, as much interest has centered
in the coming of the wife of the late
founder of Tuskegee Institute.
Booker T. Washington has been
called one of the greatest men of the
generation, measuring from where he
started to the culmination of his ca
reer The immense educational plant
at Tuskegee, Ala, where thousands of
young colored people are turned into
useful men and women, is a perman
ent monument to this man. While
the institution is now in the hands of
his successor, Mrs. Washington still
has an active interest in the work of
administration.
She has been secured to lecture on
industrial education with reference to
plans worked out at Tuskegee. There
is no doubt but that it will be seen
that she has been one of the largest
factors in the success of the work of
the late Dr. Washington.
Here Is a Man Who Can
Be Wilson and Hughes
"The man of many faces" is a term
that has been applied to Edwin R.
Weeks, head of the musical company
that is booked at Chautauqua tomor
row and Saturday. Eesides taking a
prominent part in the high-class mus
ical program that this company de
livers, Mr. Weeks has a little act of
his own in which he impersonates all
the great men of the day from Pader
ewski to Harrigan, changing from one
to the other before the eyes of the
audience Among his impersonations
are such familiar faces as Taft, Roose
velt, Hughes, Wilson, Bryan, Sherman,
Mark Twain, Caruso, and others.
Others of the features of the Weeks'
programs, which consume an hour and
a half each, are several sketches.
Among these may be mentioned
"Squire Blakslee's Clarinet," a mirth
provoking playlet that keeps the au
dience in a roar but underlying it all
is a moral and a purpose for these
days of divorces and separations.
"School Days" is a musical playlet
for children, as Mr. Weeks says "from
seven to 70 years of age" that will
amuse the former and with a
flood of memories transplant the lat
ter back into the school yard of long
ago. "Pretending" is a travesty on
modern society ways, both in the
realm of married and unmarried life,
culminating in an improvised automo
bile ride that is convulsing and uni
que.
"Hello, Peaches," introducing peo
ple of the underworld "Polly Perkins
in Paris," introducing famous music
ians "Tell Me, Pretty Maiden," in
troducing famous politicians, are other
funny sketches. "The Pickaninny" and
"The Grasshopper," in which Mr.
Weeks demonstrates himself to be a
whole opera company, including so
loist, comedian, tragedian, ballet and
chorus will also be heard when the
company appears tomorrow and Sat
urday.
Mrs. E. A. Wicks, the mother of Dr.
Wicks, is expected to arrive in the city
Wednesday evening from Canton, S.
D., for a few weeks' visit at the home
of Dr. and Mrs. Wicks- Mr. Wicks,
the doctor's father, will be here later.

Chautauqua to Be Mecca
for Ten Days Lyceum's
Biggest Attractions On
The funeral of Mrs. John Sad, who
died on Saturday, was held Sunday
afternoon at 2 o'clock from the Som
dahl undertaking parlors. Ti\e ser
vices were conducted by Rev. Nae
seth, of the Synod Lutheran church,!
and a large number of friends and
neighbors were in attendance at the
funeral. Interment was made in Hill
side cemetery, east of the city. Among
•those from out of town who came for
the funeral were Mr- and Mrs. John
Sad, of Hannaford, and Mr. and Mrs.
Pete Sad, of Dazey. John Sad, of this
city, who has been working at Hanna
ford, also was called home by the
death of his grandmother
ESTABLISHED 1STI.
For the next ten days the Valley
City Chautauqua grounds will be the
Mecca of this section of the state, if
the strongest lyceum talent that can
be obtained anywhere, an ideal camp
ing place, freedom from the heat and
all the other attractions count for any
thing.
Through special arrangement and to
give patrons an opportunity of also
visiting the Barnes county fair, inter
est thus far has been divided between
these two centers of attraction. One
glance at the program of the Chautau
qua, however, is enough to indicate
that before the session is over Valley
City will have a Chautauqua second
to none in point of quality and quan
tity of talent, to say nothing of the
many other attractions that this as
sembly can boast of.
The grounds are in perfect condi-
u°n
clean and sanitary. There are no
mosquitoes. While the city swelters
these days, Chautauqua is cool and
with the advantages it offers for the
ideal camp life, many have come to
realize that there is no need of going
further for an outing.
With the improvement of the roads
after the recent rains the enrollment
in both boys' and girls' encampments
is increasing daily, and in many re
spects is proving much more delight
ful than ever before. While these en
campments would lose some of their
value without some instruction and
regulation, there is less work and
more play this year for the young men
and women. "These boys and girls
are gaining ten-fold the expense of
their experience," is the way one
young man put it Wednesday night.
Thursday evening Cap's Orchestra
is again 'the musical attraction. It
need not be said that these people are
delightfully different from the ordi
nary orchestra. They have a snap and
a style that leaves not a dull moment
in their whole program.
Then there is
L'ol.
Shields, who will
give another of his illustrated lec
tures on our natural neighbors. Col.
Shields has already opened a big
storehouse of knowledge about our
wild birds, so large in fact, that one
wonders at having lived so close to
them without getting acquainted. He
is a staunch friend of the wild life
of the state and says while it is rare
sport to get the bead on the man at
the front who wants to shoot you
first, it is quite another matter—this
getting a pot-shot at a covey of game.
Be that as it may, your Chautauqua
experience this year will not be com
plete without having heard Col.
Shields.
One of the attractions that belongs
to a class that is bound to give the
1916 Chautauqua a distinctiveness of
its own will be heard Friday and Sat
urday when the Edwin R. Weeks com
pany makes its appearance. Edwin
R., himself, has been called a whole
opera company in one person. His
voice ranges upwards of three octaves,
which enables him to give operettas
that introduce all the various charac
ters from lofty soprano to deep bass,
but the company has attained a posi
tion pre-eminent in the lyceum world
through its popular and substantial
performances rather than through fad
and foible. With Mr. Weeks are Mrs.
Weeks and Miss Lulu Sinclaire, both
accomplished musicians and versatile
entertainers.
The Weeks company will appear
both Friday afternoon and evening
and all day Saturday.
Sunday will be another of the out
standing days of this year's assembly.
Mrs. Lillian Mitchner, said to be a sec
ond Frances E. Willard, will occupy
the platform at 11 o'clock. At 3 in the
afternoon, the Valley City Municipal
band will appear in concert and at 4
Dr. E. Melville Wylie, pastor of the
First Presbyterian church at Mont
clair, N. J., will speak. Dr. Wylie is
known throughout his own state as the
pastor of the largest and most influ
ential church in New Jersey. He is
known in several states through his
lecture, "Parenthood by Proxy."
Besides the usual features, next
week's programs will include Dr. E. T.
Mathes, whose experiences have led
him from Mexico to Alaska, and he
will speak about both Hon. Ben
Drake the Valkota Male Quartet the
Chicago Operatic Co. Normal School
day the Saddlers, who have been call
ed "a whole Chautauqua in them
selves" Mrs. Ella M. Shippy Dr.
James H. McLaren, the noted Pacific
coast orator Bouck White, who

and many other notable attractions.
Valley City Strawberries
Are Unexcelled Anywhere
Manager Hilborn, of the Northwest
Nursery Co-, left a box of strawber
ries for the editor Wednesday that
would be hard to beat in any state.
The Hood River product would hardly
measure up to the Valley City speci
mens either in size or color. It is the
first picking from the patch at the nur
sery grounds, and the crop is bounti
ful and the berries delicious.
