fies the present $25,000 appropria-
tion," added Superintendent Schulz
"That isn't big enough to dig a hole
That appropriation will remain un
touched We need a $150,000 ap
propriation We might get enough
in 1917 to start work If we don't
things will certainly mark time as
they are now until we get busy."

Bemidji normal in this department,"
W Wheelock of the board of con
trol told the United Press "The
whole matter is up to Superintendent
