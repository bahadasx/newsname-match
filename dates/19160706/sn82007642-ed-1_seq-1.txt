The text of the latest Mexican
note as submitted by Mr. Arren
do, Ambassador Designate, fol
lows: "Washington. D. C. July 4, 1910
"Mr. Secretary:
"I have the honor to transmit
in continuation the textofanote
I have just received from my gov
ernment with instructions to
present it to Your Excellency:
" 'Mr. Secretary:
"-'Referring to the notes of
June 20 and 25 last, 1 have the
honor to say to Your Excellency
that the immediate release of the
Carrizal prisoners was a further
proof of the sincerity of the de
sires of this government to reach
a pacific and satisfactory ar
rangement of present difficulties.
This government is anxious to
golve the present conflict and it
would be unjust if its attitude
were misinterpreted.
" 'It was also the Mexican gov
ernment that earnestly sugges
ted a plan for cantonments along
the boundary line during the con
ferences of Ciudad Juarez and El
Paso. This government is dis
posed now, as it has always been
to seek an immediate solution of
the two points which constitute
the true causes of the conflict be
tween the two countries, to wit:
The American Government be
lieves reasonably that the inse
curity 6! its frontier is a source
of difficulty and the Mexican Gov
ernment on its part believes that
the stay of American troops on
Mexican territory aside from be
ine a trespass on the sovereignty
of Mexico is the immediate cause
nf the, conflicts. Therefore, the
withdrawal of American troops,
on one hand; and the protection
of the frontier, on the other, are
the two essential problems, the
solution of which must be the di
recting obiect of the efforts of
C3 4
both governments.
" 'The Mexican government is
willing to consider in a quick and
practical way and prompted by
a spirit of concord the remedies
which should be applied to the
present situation.
" 'Several Latin-American coun
tries have offered their friendly
mediation to the Mexican gov
ernment and the latter una ac
cepted it in principle. Therefore,
the Mexican government only
awaits information that the gov
ernment of the United States
would be disposed to accapt this
mediation for the purpose mn-
tioned above or whether it is st ill
of the belief that the same re
sults may be attained by means
of direct negotiations between
both governments. .
"In the meantime this govern
ment proposes to employ all ef
forts that may be at its disposa
to avoid the recurrence of new in
cidents which may complicate
and aggravate the situation. At
the same time it hopes that the
American government on its part
may make use of all efforts to
prevent also new acts of its mili
tury and civil authorities of the
frontier that might cause new
complications.
"I avail myself of this oppor
tunity to reiterate to your Excel
lence the assurance of my most
"distinguished consideration.
(Signed) "C. AGU1LAR."
Having thus complied with
. higher instructions of my Gov
ernment it affords me pleasure to
, reiterate to your Excellency the
assurance of my nigbest consul
eration.
(Signed) "E ARREDENDO."

Have A Real Home On Your Fun.
Progressive Farmer.
A farm with an unpainted house
standing in an open field in the
glaring sunshine, with corn rows
ning up near it, no green
grass, no shrubs, no shrubbery,
and not a flower blooming ar
ound it, is a place the boys and
girls of the family will embrace
the first opportunity to escape
rom.
Especially will this be the case
with the girls if the interior of
the house corresponds with the
exterior, for much of the beauty
and comfort of the home de
pends on the women having a
chance to beautfy the interior.
The farmer in such a place as I
have described may by most rig
id economy accumulate money,
and may get a reputation among
his neighbors as a good farmer,
simply because he has made
some money. But he has missed
ife, real life, and has simply been
grubbing after filthy lucre. He
has failed to make a home, and
rom the old house that was sim
ply a shelter, the boys and girls
will leave him to himself after a
while, and would not be manly
boys nor womanly women if they
did not. For the boys and girls
are catching the spirit that is
abroad in the South, and will
leave the old shelter and be ma
king real homes for themselves.
Painting the house is not only
adding to its appearance, but is
important in adding durability
to the wood-word. A building
should be painted every three
years at least.
Then make a grass lawn about
)he house, especially a good
sweep of grass showing from the
front windows. While trees and
shrubbery are important and de
sirable, do not smother the
whole front with trees but keep
some open lawn there and plant
trees and shrubcry as a frame
work for the lawn. In other Sou
thern homes we use the porches
more for shade than the trees,
and we do not want the breeze
smothered out by too thick
planting of trees.
Flowering shrubbery along the
base of the house greatly helps
the appearances of the house it
self, and with a variety that
bloom in succession from early
spring to late summer the shrub
bery can be made very attrac
tive and interesting. Then to
the sides of the dwelling have
some flower beds, largely of the
hardy herbafceceous plants that
como up and bloom every year,
with some of the summer flower
ing bulbs like the old Madonna
lily and gladiolus, and on the
shady side of the house a bed of
the lily of the valley.
Bowel Complaint in India.
In a lecture at one ot the Des
Moines, loa,thurcheHa mission
nry from India told of going in
to the interior of India, where he
was taken sick, that he had a
bottle of Chamberlain's Colic,
Cholera and Diarrhoea Remedy
with linn and 'telievrd that it
saved hit life. Thlx remedy is us
ed succfSB'ully in India both aa
preventative and cure lor chol
era. You may know from thin
that it can be depended upon tor
the iniMer forms of bowel com
plninr that occur in this coun
try. Obtainable everywhere.

How to Get Rid of a Cold.
Rpad how C E Summers, Hol-
diedge, Neb., got rid of his cold
"1 contracted a severe cough and
cold ami rould hardly sleep. By
using Foley's Honey and Tar as
directed my coujrh was entirely
cured aud I give it full credit for
my speedy recovery." Foley's hI
way soothes and heals. Chil
dren love it. 11 B Blackburn.
Poverty And Piety.
Almost every day we fall in
with good people who have a
deep-seated conviction that pov
erty promotes piety, that wealth
breeds wickedness, and that the
church has nothing to do with
treasure on earth, and the prob
lems of material welfare and well
being.
We never argue these questions
but we always wonder what the
Master meant when he counseled
the disciples to make for them-,
selves friends of the Mammon of
unrighteousness. Is it not poss
ible that in this matter the child
ren of this world are wiser than
the children of light?
Dr. George Adam Smith, the
noted Scotch ministerand author
has an interesting chapter on
this subject. Ho contends that
the great spiritual awakening of
history has been preceded by con
ditions of wealth and comfort.
Tjollardy, says he, grew out of
the opulence of Norfolk, Puritan
ism out of the trading prosperity
of England, and Methodism out
of the improved wages of English
toils.
As a matter of fact, are efforts
for improved social conditions a
preparation for the Gospel? Or
is the Gospel a preparation for
improved social conditions a
prelude to abundant corn and oil
and wine, to use Joel's phrase?
Here are fundamental ques
tions that call for definite, cer
tain answers in these times of soc
ial ferment News Letter.
Avoid Colds.
Sudden changes, high winds,
shifting seasons cauee colds and
grippe, and these summer colds
are annoying and dangerous
and are likely to turn into a
chronic cough In uch cases take
a treatment ot Dr. King's New
Discovery, n pleasant Laxative
Tar byrup. It sooths the cough,
checks the cold and helps breu'k
up an attack of grippe, Its alrea

covery. Tested and tried for over
40 years.
Mills Prosperous.
This from The Lenoir Topic,
will be of interest to many of
readers who are interested in one
or more ol the coaon mills in
Lenoir:
Mr. J. L. Nelson, secretary and
treasurer of the four cotton mills
in Lenoir and vicinity, has just
issued a very gratifying report.
On July 1st, he paid out to the
stockholders the sum of $45,484
in semi-anuual dividends, most
of which goes to local citizens
who will spend the money here.
The faithful employees also share
in the increasing prosperity by
Having their wages increased a-
bout ten per cent, u fact which
indicates the fairness of the mill
management.
The success of the local enter
prises is very gratifying to the
public generally, as it is an indi
cation or a very prosperous con
dition of the cotton mill business
here and else whore.
Forethought.

tle forethought olten saves them

Mr. Clingman Story Passes.
After an illness of only a little
more than 24 hours, Mr. Cling
man Story, of Blowing Rock, R.F.
D. passed to the great beyond at
his home at 3, p. m., last Thurs
day. He was in thebe9t of health
at noon Wednesday, and seemed
unusually cheerful, but 6hortiy
after dinner, he ate some cherries
and returned to his work in the
field. He was very much heated
and drank copious draughts of
cold water, and in a short while
he was taken sickr and rapidly
grew worse until death relieved
him. notwithstanding the fact
that all possible wus dona for
his relief.
Mr. Story has been a h a r d
worker, reared a very large fam
ily, two of them having gradua
ted at the A. T. S-Miss Pearl
and Prof. T. E. Story, principal
of Oak Hill Academy, who, after
leaving Bchool here, never stop
ped until he had procured a col
legiate education at' tne Uuiver
sity. Deceased, though not possess
ed of an education, was one of
Watauga's good citizens, being
honest to a cent, a splendid neigh
bor and warm friend. Wo have
heard this so often: "ClingStory
was a good citizen, and I am in
deed sorry to hear of his death."

When The War Ends.
There are a great many things
about the war in Europe that
wring the heart, but probably
the saddest is the fact that Ger
man, French and Belgian Social
iHts, wuo in peace times were
striving for tho same ends, are
now engaged in snuffing out the
lives of their own followers, be
cause Socialism is international
in its scope. It is hard to imag
ine men who stand for the same
things killingeaeh other, but that
is what the Socialists of Europe
are doing.
Tho hope that after tho present
war tuo brotherhood ot man
may be more nearly realized is
uot confined to tho Socialists of
Europe; that is a uui vernal desire
in so far as war is concerned.
Already there is much specula-
tion as to what form the Euro
pean governments will takewheii
this war is over, and the hope is
general (hat the people who must
do the fighting will be nb!e
say when they shull ugut.

Will Carry New York.
The Observer has met with a
New York man who has had con
siderable experience in politics in
that State, and who says that
while at this time the odds might
appear to be as much as 5 to one
against Wilson, nevertheless,
Wilson is going to carry New
York State. Along with that
State, he will carry New Jersey.
Neither of theso States has been
iu any conceded to Wilson. Ou
the other hand, speculation has
so far been in favor ol Hughes,
but the Observer's information
predicts that by the time the
campaign is well under way, the
public will be able to discern a
distinct drift in the political wind.
There are some "inside" facts
forthcoming that will tend to
sustain the claims that have
been made to this paper. Those
who are figuring on a victory
for Hughes in New York are go
ing to have reasons to revise their
views. Charlotte Observer.
