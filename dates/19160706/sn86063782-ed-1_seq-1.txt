FOLLOWED JOFFltE'S PLANS
While French Were Guarding Verdun
English Prepared for Great
Offensive.
London July 4.?"Only German soldiers
in open field formations now
stand between the French and the
River Somme" said Major Gen. F. B.
Maurice to-day referring to the part
of the river which flows northward

the Frenc have made their greatest
gains.
"The last of the enemy's defensive
works in that sector have been captured
by our allies."
In giving the results attained by
eht allied offensive of the western
front, Major Gen. Maurice, who is director
of the military operations oi
the general staff, continued:
"Much underserved oblique has
been heaped upon the British army by
English, French and American people
because we apparently did nithing to
assist the French in the desperate
fighting on the Vesdun front. But all
this time we were doing the part requested
by Gen. Joffre.
"Accirding to this plan we conserved
our troops, accumulated sup.
plies and waited the word for the
grand offensive, in which we were to
play our part with the Russians and
Italians, as well as the French. Aaturally
during these anxious weeks we
could give out no exciting news, because
our deliberate preparations
were not good copy. For certain tactical
and moral reasons, which need
not be dilated on, it was necessary
that the French should not lose the
east bank of the Meuse, and Gen. Joffre
informed us that he could hold the
pisltions which command that part of
the rlwr until the end of June, so*we
knew we were going to strike at the
beginning of July.
staffs included offensives by the Russ,
sians and Italians which, 1 do not
need to tell you, already have begun.
We are not disappointed with our own
advance, which we expected to be
lsow, and we are enormously pleased
with the wonderful progress made by
the French who, with comparatively
light losses, are sweeping forward to
the Somme.
"It is quite evident the Germans
were surprised by the strength of the
French offensive. They evidently believed
our allies would be kept too
busy before Verdun to participate seriously
in the western offensive, which
they knew was coming. Consequently
they made extensive preparations before
our front, pilling up reinforcements
there while comparatively neglecting
the southern sector, dominated
by the French. Tae Germans,
anticipating our move, brought up
great forces, much of which consisted
of independent units called Mosqueton
battalions, armed only with light
machine guns. It was these battalions
which inflicted the heaviest
losses on us.
Determined Resistance.
"Our enemy is brave and resourceful
and put up a desperate defense especially
in the region from Gonmiecourt
to Fricourt, where he evidently
expected our main attack. In this
region the fighting was especially severe.
The chalk formations gave the
(ivnuitus a s^icuuiu v-wnnc iv ?...
the best use of their miners, who constructed
dug-outs and other defendve
works, which our heaviest shells could
not destroy. From these works Mosqueton
battalions put up most determined
resistance.
"Physical features made the capture
of Friciurt peculiarly difficult
and our severe losses there were not
unexpected. Montauban was one ot
the strongest positions occupied by
the Germans, but our advance there
was brilliant and rapid, without the
losses suffered between Gommecourt
and Fricourt.
"On the whole we are well satis,
field with our advance. We will continue
our artillery preparation, as we
have no intention of butting our head
against a stone wall. The human factor
must be considered and this factor
presents some unexpected problems
on the German side, since after
all the progress of any offensive. We
are meeting strenuous opposition.
Prnirress Will He Slow.
"Our progress most certainly will
be deliberate. Many places like Fricourt
will be taken only after over^xomiug
desperate opposition.
"That our gallant allies should adB
vance faster with smaller losses than
we Is not only the fortune of war, but
may be called poetic justice, since
they lost so heavily during the long
weeks while we were getting ready
i
to take our share in the great off<
sive. However, it must be clear nc
even to laymen, that the blame het
ed on us for not going to the aid
the French before Verdun was qu
underserved, as we are doing exac
what Gen. Joffre requested. A
when he gave the word we sprang
the attack in which we have suffer
greviously, but which eads to no i
gret beyond sorow for the fallen; 1
it now is our time to stand the bn
of battle.
"South of th Somme the Germa
were completely surprised and our
lies will get through to the river wil
out much loss. In that region y
may look for immediate developmen
as the fighting there now is in op
field formation, the last of the ei
my's works having been captured,
glance at the map will show you tl
our allies are clear across tee i
work of trenches.
"Farther north you will note tl
while our line is now behind the fii
series of German defences, we are

he The Torrens system of registration 8bc
ed of land titles is no effective in South
:or Carolina. Under its provisions the
0,- clerk of court is to appoint by Au- ?
lat gust 1 three or more attorneys, who
he are to be examiners of titles; the Pa|
nd county commissioners must provide ^ f
>b- a register of mesne conveyance for
it- the registration if titles. The pro- J
of visions of the act are assumed volof
untarily. tb(
ds. The advantage of the Torrens sys- rei
lie etm is that after land is once regis- J
*al terer under this plan, there will be pIc
lin no further question of the title and it bo)
:o- will not be necessary to have the title ]
he examined for any subsequent trans- ,bei
ic- fers of the land. The object of the aft
ie. system is to give a clear title ti land.
ile The Torrens act fixes the fees that ^
it- are to be allowed to the title exami- tin
to ners, officers and surveyors. The ex- ^a
ng aminei* is to receive a minimum fee v
of $5 for examination of each title of be<
ins property assessed upon the tax books cai
is at $1,000 or less, and for each addi- 1
)00 tional $1,000 of assessed value he is sp(
to rprpivp so oents. The surveyor
ay employed under the provisions of the
ue act is to be allowed not more than
up 40 cents per houh for the time ac- vic
lie tually employed. ne'
en In order to guarantee the title, and
it- at the same time to protect against 1

the year 1914, and great progicos

of an efficient held force. While
the commissioned strength suffered

in measure to an anticipation of Immediate
active service. As a precaution
for efficiency the uae of typhoid
prophylactic was undertaken on an extended
scale during the year. Nearly
80,000 members of the mllltla were inoculated
with the serum. Within the

r. It is an error to suppose that thp
tt nominal strength of the national guard
v | Is all there is to it for effectiveness. A
' peace strength Is recognized and also
J-1 an emergency or war strength. For
r-1 Instance, the ten company regiment of
I peaco Is Increased to twelve companies
for war, and the fifty to sixty men
company is recruited up to 100 men.
Then there Is what may be called an
untabulnted or uunsslgned reserve,
, comprising men who have had one to
; three years' training In the guard and
is have been discharged, but consider
?-[ themselves members of the guard and
ie will volunteer to join their former rog3_
iment or any guard regiment not filled
to the maximum. This gives cohesion

Major General O'Ryan, commanding
:he national guard of New York state,
n a recent article declared that the
nllitla today Is 100 per cent better than
it the time of the Spanish-American
,var and that the time to talk of a mllila
camp as a place for revel and frolic
s past He goes on to say:
"This question of our national defense
simmers down to a necessity for
nore militia, properly organized and
rained, and to a system of reserves for
he army and the militia. Twelve divisions
comprising about 350,000 men
vould be the Ideal number. To create
inch a fighting machine would Involve
:omparatlvely little expense. The prlnary
result would be an adequate
irmy. But the result would be much
nore than that It would mean a
jackbone of quiet patriotism and a
tnowledge of what war means. The
atter would make any half baked popular
demand for war less possible."
Opinions of Governors.
The question of increasing the millla
forces of the country is one that
las been the subject of much eontro'ersy
of late. Recently the New York
rimes submitted this question to a
lumber of governors of various states,
lost of the governors sent answers
idvocatlng an increase of the militia
orces. In his reply Governor Walsh
tf Massachusetts says:
"Additional militia troops to the num>er
of 100,000 men should be organized
o make up the deficiency in the differ nt
branches of the service, so that
publicity should be begun at once in
this country, In order to acquaint
Americans with the militia and to in
uard Camp Scene
tipped with regulation arm; tents and
form them ofTts needs."
Governor Willis of Ohio says:
"For state purposes the Ohio national
guard carries probably enough
units to take care of any internal or
local difficulties, but as an integral
part of a national defense it would be
the part of wisdom to increase the
units not only in this state, but in all
other states. To accomplish this federal
assistance and federal control and
supervision to a greater degree are necessary.
"Our national form of government is
such as to make it unwise to maintain
a large standing army. It is also true
that national preparedness for defense
is a question that cannot lightly be
turned aside or overlooked. It is tremendously
important that our government
take reasonable and prompt steps
to acquire a reasonable sized, mobile,
trained soldiery. This can be accomplished
more quickly, more easily and
more properly, also with less expense,
through the national guard of the country
than In any other way yet thought j
of and suggested."
The secretary of war In bla last report
says:
"If all of the national guard could
be summoned In the event of war and
should all respond (an inconceivable
result) and If they were all found fairly
efficient In the first line?that is. the
troops who would be expected Immediately
to take the Held?we could
summon a force in this country of reg-.
ulars and national guard amounting to
3,818 officers and 150.492 men."
The plan, approved by the war department.
for the organization of four
held armies of three divisions each,
which plan gives the number of troops
Df all arms that each state would bo
called upon^o provide Immediately for I
the national defense jn the event of a
?z ***??' ?
national crisis, 'has been transmitted
to the national guard commanders.
Doubling the National Quard.
The plan which has beep transmitted
to the national guard commanders contemplates
an army, Including regulars
gnd mllltla, of 310,264 men, which
means almost doubling the present
force of the national guard.
Under present laws and arrangements
the federal government has
about reached Its limit of effectiveness
In dealing with the forty-eight sepa-|
rate and distinct forces, ft naa no
power to direct the course of training,;
the composition of the several forces
and their balancing of arms, and It Is
more or lesa helpless In Its authority
over the arjns and munitions issued
to the states. In some states there
have been disputes as to its right to
direct the expenditures of the federal ,
funds appropriated by acts of congress.
At the present time the federal
government cannot remove Inefficient '
OTinrri officers or reward the efficient
officer*. .~v #
Other features of the system which
regular army officers have criticised as
Impairing Its efficiency for service in
war are pointed out by General W.
H. Carter In his recently published
