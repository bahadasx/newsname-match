Col. Roosevelt cannot become a
major tjeneral as long as President
Wilson has a voice in the matter.
It is to be regretted that Ed. L.
Rogers did not receive the nomi
nation for Congress on the Re
publican ticket in the Sixth Dis
trict. The fact is the Scandinav
ian vote outnumbered the Indian,
Irish and German vote in the
district.
Doctor Frazier, formerly lo
cated at Detroit, has offered the
secretary of war a regiment of
Chippewas. It is very doubtful
whether the doctor could raise a
corporal's guard among the Chip
pewas, bat entirely impossible for
him to raise a regiment, there

responsibility by offering a regi

O Senator Clapp,
The Minneapolis Journal's "Min
nesota Politics" column says, in
referring to the recent primary
election, that "Clapp's strength
/was noticeable in the White Earth
reservation country."
The Journal has been insisting
for two or three yea^s past, or
since Sen. Clapp became a Pro
gressive Republican, that the
Clapp Act had injured the Chip
pewas on this reservation, but the
actions of the Indians themselves
in voting for the man who, the
Journal says, had injured them, is
a refutation of the statement ac
cording to the stand taken by
them.
jSen. Clapp has been maligned
by the Twin City press regarding
White Earth matters, but the In
dians by their votes showed there
Sr^kas no basis for the statements
made by these papers.

Should Not Repealed
But Enforced.
The Wadena Pioneer states that
"The Minnesota corrupt practices
act should either be amended into
workable statute or else repealed.
We do not believe there has been
a campaign made for any candi
date in the state this year which
has been conducted in strict con
formity with the law, and any law
which is so generally violated
must have something wrong with
it."
There is hardly a newspaper
editor in this state, nor a public
man, who does not know of the
corrupt manner in which the re
cent senatorial campaign was con
ducted by one, if not two, of the
candidates, and unless indications
are misleading the public will be
come acquainted with the facts at
the forthcoming campaign.
It is also openly stated that one
of the candidates for lieutenant
governor spent over twenty-five
thousand dollars instead of only
thirty-five hundred, the limit al
lowed by law, to secure his nom
ination.
The corrupt practice act is allof
right if it is enforced, and those
who secured their nominations
through unlimited expenditure of
money should be disqualified as
candidates under the state law. If
this should be done Senator Clapp
w.#uld be the republican nominee
for the United States Ser-ate.
FRM^rNNESOTA
POLITICS."
The Fairmont Sentinel pays a
high compliment to the new re
publican national committeeman
from Minnesota. The Frank Day
paper says:
Mr. Congdon is one of the few
multi millionaires who refuses to
sneeze every time the Wall street
fat boys take snuff He is truly a
progressive and on the question of
booze is as right as a golden
guinea. He hates saluonism and
contributes to drive them out ofing
business.''
Gospel is not truer than the
statement of the Fairmont Sentinel
regarding Chester A. Congdon,
Minnesota's new republican na
tional committeeman. It was only
last week that Dan W. Lawler,
Democratic nominee for the Unit
ed States Senate, was heard to
say: "Whatever Mr. Congdon
may say may be regarded as true,
for there is no foolishness about
him." The Republican party of
Minnesota showed much sense in
selecting Mr. Congdon for national
committeeman from this state, for
tlie public will have confidence in
his methods of conducting a cam
paign and, therefore, more confi
dence in the Republican party in
this state.

to their agent, Charles L. Davis,
who was in Omaha recently pur
chasing 2,000 heifers and 500

It was only a quarter of a cent

known in those days as the Spot

wild old chief, Spotted Tail, laid

Drunken Brawls.
It is a common occurrence to
see drunken brawls on the streets
of this village notwithstanding the
strict law against the introduction
intoxicants into the Indian
country.
The last Indian appropriation
act contains the following provis
ion: "The provisions of sections
twenty one hundred and forty and
twenty-one hundred and forty-one
of the Revised Statutes of the
State shall also apply to beer and
other intoxicating liquors named
intfoe^&v&'Qt January thirtieth,
eighteen hundred and ninety-seven
(Twenty-ninth Statutes at Large,
page five hundred and six), and
the possession by a person of in
toxicating liquors in the country
where the introduction is prohibit
ed by treaty or Federal statute
shall be prima facie evidence of
unlawful introduction,"
The members of this reserva
tion will observe that it is ex
tremely dangerous for anyone to
have government officers find in
toxicating liquor in his possession,
and that he takes chances of hav
both a fine and imprisonment
imposed upon him, so that every
one should beware.
Indian Farmers' Unique
Meeting.
Topbar, S. D.A unique gath
ering of Indians recently was held
ou the Moreau river, the purpose
of the gathering showing the ev
olution of the Sioux Indians to
ward the pursuits of peace.
Those in attendance were Indian
farmers from the Cheyenne reser
vation, who gathered for the pur
pose of discussing various branches
of farming. The discussions on
the various topics were led by
Walter Swift Bird, late a member
of th* council which conducts the
business affairs of all Indians on
the reservation.
Henry Hodgkiss one of the
leading Sioux, discussed "Better
Farming."
Henry LeBeau made an ad
dress on "Soils that Produce
Most," and Henry Turtle Necklace
spoke on "Better Horses."The
Peace Pipe.

tion to more peaceful pursuits.
Today old "Spot's" band is the
most enlightened of the Sioux
tribes. Their lands occupy four
counties of the southern tier in
South Dakota, just across the Ne
braska state line. The Indians
number 5,500 and are increasing
instead of decreasing, as is the
case with many Indian tribes.
They are, in the main, farmers
and are self-supporting. They
grow wheat and corn and raise
cattle and horses. They are fast
educating their children and they
have nearly $1,000,000 on deposit
in the banks in the towns of the
white people across the line in Ne
braska.
Colonel Davis has been in Wash
ington in consultation with the In
dian bureau, and it was while in
that city he obtained permission
to buy about $50,000 worth of
heifers and mares for the Indians.
