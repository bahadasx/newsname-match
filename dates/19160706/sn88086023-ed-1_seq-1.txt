Health Bureau of New York City is
Unable to Tabulate Cases So!
Rapidly Have They Been Reported
SPREADING TO OTHER CITIES
Cases Itfimrted In Illinois Today;
More Than oo Hate Been Reported
In New York Since Epidemic Start
ed: 25 IVr Cent of the Cases Thus
Par Have Been Fatal.
.NEW YOKE, July 6. Twenty
four new deaths from Infantile
paralysis were reported this mor
ning, making; a total of 154 since
the first caaue was discovered.
One hundred and thirty-three
new hum were reporu-d today.
NEW YORK. JiiU 6. The Infan
tile paralysis epidemic apparently had
spread to nearby cities today. In the
meanwhile It showed its greater viru
lence in New York itself. Cases were
reported so fast through the night
that the health bureau announced this
morning It had not completed com
pilations of the number of victims or
the cases.
More than 600 cases have been re
ported since the epidemic started. The
moM sinister fact is that the mortal
ity exceeds all previous records.
Twenty-five, per cent -if the cases have
been fatal.
The health bureau will ask for the
issuance of special bunds to defray
the expenses of fighting the plague.
Experts fear the epidemic will not
spend itself for a month. Infantile
Paralysis attains Its greatest virulence
In August. An emergency call for
nurses, physician and volunteer san
itation workers has leen issued.
Churches have been asked to close
Sunday schools ami discontinue picnic
plans.
SPRINGFIELD, 111.. July 6. The
outbreak of infantile paralysis today
assumed alarming proportions in Il
linois. Additional cases were discov
ered in Franklin Ford and La Salle
loc unties, following an outbreak in
j Putnam county, Though the cases
are Widely separated, the board of
health believes they all are of the
, simie origin.
Increase in Cattle Expected.
WASHINGTON, July 6 Cattle
production in the western states
should increase in the next few years,
the agricultural department estimat
ed today It was expected that the
increased efficiency would more than
offset any lessening in free range
It Is estimated that there is 34S bil-
Hen feet of privately owned timber in j
Oregon west of the Cascade range, and
27(1 billion feet in Washington. The
national forests contain 162 billion I
feet, making for the west side Of the
two states a total stand of timber esti
mated at 70 billion board feet.

COMMITTEE) IS APPOINTED
WORK ON PLAN FOB THE
SUMMER MONTHS.
Ill
For the purpose of devising some
plan for giving to the people the ex
cess water of the municipal system
during the summer months without
additional cost, a committee, consist
ing of Councilmen Taylor. Penland
and Phelps, was appointed last even
ing to confer with the water commis
sion. Mayor Rest suggested that the wa
ter, now going through the waste pipe
ai the Intake, be turned into the sys
tem and that it be divided on a per
centage basis among the users of
Pendleton His plan was to have lo
cal users pledge themselves to pay the
same water rent month by month as
last year and then give them their
proportion of the excess.
This is exactly the same plan as ad
apted last -year by the water commis
sion and it failed to work out satis
factorily. The only water user in the
city to take advantage of It was Com
missioner C. P. Strain. The majority
y ere opposed to pledging themselves
tn paying the same as the year before,
regardless of weather conditions, up
on the chance of getting an extra am
ount of water gratis..
At the meeting last evening the
council passed the ordinance provid
ing for fees for city foreclosures. The
bawdy house ordinance. Introduced a
week ago. was not brought up.
Residents of Maple and Pine streets
cnmplalned that all of the people of
that section were not connecting with
the sewer as provided by ordinance
nnd I'ouncilman Phelps reported that
the matter would be attended to.
Four bids for flushing the streets
were opened last evening. Beck &

contract, bid $349 or Just one dollar

-At TO HEAD.
WiMlINGl'ON, July 6 The puni
tive expedition will not withdraw
from Mexico merely because of Car
ranza's irlendly note, it was officially
stated There were Indications that
the dicument paved the way for a
discuhs on which ultimately would end
in withdrawal ; nd the establishment
of bord-r patrols. Any withdrawal is
lontiugert upon Carranxax's demon
stration of his ability to police north
ern Mexico.
Thuugh convinced that danger of a
war with Mexico has passed, the de
pat tment today clung to the original
intention to send all the militiamen
to the border. Although it was sug
gested that the forces not already en
trained might remain in mobilisation
camps, the department stated there
was no change in the plans.
After a conference with the presi
dent. L-insing taid a reply would be
sent to Carranr.i soon and negotia
tions opened.
Wilson and Lansing thoroughly dis
cussed -he contents of a reply to Car-ranz-j's
note. They would not reveil
an Inkling of its contents.
Aguilar issued a statement to the
Mexican people today that he expect
ed a completely satisfactory solution
of all questions between Mexico and
the L'nlted States without Injury to
the prime interests of the Mexican re
public." This information was ca
bled to Arrendondo

Reports that gold Is being paid to

contrast with the virtual confiscation
of foodstuffs by the defacto forces and
