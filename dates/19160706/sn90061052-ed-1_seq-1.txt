who explained that the reason he could
sell goods below cost wns because he
pold so many of them The faot of the
business is the publisher who does riot
contemplate raising his prices on sub
scription and job warkor has not already
done so is lilce the sinner that remains
obdurate to hrs own spiritual welfare
and doubts the existenee of a hereafter

GULICK SELLS HIS HERD
Retires From Hereford Breeding
Business for a Time at Least
Frank Gulick woli known farmer
and breeder of Hereford cattle sold his
entire herd last week One sale of ill
cows cahes and heifers was recorded
in this paper last week These cattle
went to a breeder named Coy whose
ranch is in Arkansas and who lives at
Monett He paid 5000 for ten young
cows and calves ten 2-year-old heifers
and one 2-year-old male
The balance of the herd went to W
T MeCray of Kentland Ind He
bought 01 cows 12 bulls and it5 calves
for which he paid 825000
Among this herd was old Corrector
Fairfax the bull Mr Gulick bought of
Mr MeCray three years ago for 1750
Mr Qulick and his cattle have been
seen at the fairs nnd stock shows in
Missouri Kansas Oklahoma and Ark
ansas the past few years and have won
many premiums over cattle from the
best breeders in the country
Mr Gulick has not announced his
plans for the future but his 1200 acre
place five miles west of Jasper will
probably keep him occupied whether
he has Hereford cattle or not If he
does find time hanging heavily he can
get all the exercise he wants chasing
jack rabbits over those pastures

The Usual Way
You can tell a man your troubles
You can weop and moan and wnil
You can tell hint youll go bankrupt
That maybe youll go to jail
You can tell your inmost secret
You can bare your lifes one blot
And hell say I want to help you
But what asset have you got
