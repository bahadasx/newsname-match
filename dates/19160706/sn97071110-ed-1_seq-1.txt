TRNEST J. BIAS, community development man, originator of the slogan,
"Bury your hammers and buy horns," is a primed "pep" promoter of
progress. He knows that the range of an idea, like a bullet, depends on
the power behind It. The "sights" are all raised on his artillery. He puts a
"crimp" In the crank, loosens the skin of the hidebound and whips a town into
boosting form.

CITIZEN'S AWAKEN TO REALIZATION
Columbia River Highway Opens Treasure
Chamber and Motor Tourists Already
Swarm Into the Mid-Columbia
While Nature was providing soil ele
ments and climatic conditions in the
mid-Columbia region of Oregon and
Washington that have been found sec
ond to none in the production of fruit,
she was incidentally establishing coun
less points of awe-inspiring and charm
ing scenic interest. A summer weather
condition that makes for good fruit is
also beneficial to human beings.and the
summer nights of the Hood River and
White Salmon valleys, even of the low
er altitudes, are rarely too warm for
comfortable sleeping beneath a blanket
Nature has been ages, even eons, en
gaged in her task of building these two
play and work places of the Northwest
As recreation centers they are just be
ing discovered by the people of the
Northwest and their visitors. The Co
lumbia River highway has been the
key that has unlocked the door of the
scenic treasure house. Already this
summer, the season scarcely yet begun,
it is probable that more people have
motored through the Hood River and
White Salmon valley than during any
entire single season of past years. The
citizens of the Hood River and White
Salmon communities are awakening to
the asset they possess in the appeal of
their cascading mountain streams, their
snow peaks, Hood, Adams and the fir
fringed surrounding ranges. It may be
safely predicted that the summer re
sort business in the two sections is just
beginning, and that in future years,
not so far distant thousands instead of
hundreds will make annual summer
time pilgrimages here to drink in, while
they fill their lungs with pure bracing
mountain air, the magnificence of Na
ture's prodigality.
The topography of the Hood River
and White Salmon valleys are very
similar. Each ..has its guardian snow
capped mountain peak Hood looming
1 1,225 ieet at the south end or the Hood
River valley and Adams, piercing the
skies at an altitude of, feet and
forming the north barrier of the White
Salmon country. The two mountain
peaks are approximately b5 miles apart
equidistant from the Columbia river.

For two decades past comparatively
small numbers of travelers have come
to Hood River and White salmon to
visit the two mountains and stop at the
regions' pioneer resorts, respectively
Cloud Cap Inn, at a mile altitude in the
last timberline or the base or Mount
Hood, and the Guler hotel, located in a
more Das tor a I region on Trout Lake
near the base of Mount Adams. The J
former was visited for the views at i
the side of Eliot Glacier, and the Gu
ler hotel held an appeal because of the
delightful fishing in Trout Lake, and
its outlet stream, Trout creek, and the
numerous side trips to park like pine
forests, lava and ice caves and a sight
of the "Sleeping Beauty," the perfect
silhouette outline of a reclining woman,
surrounded by mountain range and for
est. The Trout Lake resort was formerly
owned by Chris Guler, a native of
Switzerland, who declares that he was
attracted to the district because of its
similarity to some of the meadowland
regions'of.his home country. Mr. Gu
ler several years ago disposed of the
property to J. E. Keynoms, wno con
tinues to oDerate the hostelry. The
Guler hotel has been recently improved
and enlarged. In addition to providing
indoor bedrooms, Mr. Reynolds has a
laree number of comfortably equipped
tents for the accommodation ..of this
guests.
A second Trout Lake summer resort,
Mountain Brook Inn, has been operated
for the past several years by Mrs. M.
Billings. Mountain Brook Inn is a
homelike dace, and because of the ex
cellence of Mrs. Billings' meals, has
become very popular. It is within easy
access of Trout creek and a glorious
view is obtained of Mount Adams.
Mrs. Billings operates an automobile
out of Portland weekly, leaving eacb
Saturday and returning Monday.
Mrs. J. M. Filloon haa a string of
tents in the meadowa along Trout
creek and Thode Bros, have a number
of small summer cottages for lease to
summer vacationists. The address of
the Guler hotel, Thode Bros, and Mrs.
Killoon is Guler, Wash., while that of
Mrs. Billings is Trout Lake, Wash.
From White Salmon to Trout Lake
resorts one may choose one of three
different-mutes, all of them passing
through dense forests. Two of the
routes may be conaidered aomewbat
roundabout to the man in a hurry, but
be will not regret the additional dis
tance. These two ways pass up the
east side of the White Salmon river to
the Camas Prairie section of Klickitat
county to Glenwood and thence north
west again through a pine area of the
Columbia national forest. In dropping
down from the rim of the surrounding
ranges that envelope the Trout Lake
valley the visitor obtains a superb pan
orama view of the pastoral scenes of
the valley floor, broad fields of luxuri
ant alfalfa and many herda of cows
feeding, handsome country homes and
big, substantial barns. The white rib
bon of the upper White Salmon bisects
the fertile district
In the White Salmon community
proper, are two summer resorst The
Eyrie, on the bluffs of the Columbia,
operated by C W. J. Reckera, and the
Jewett Farm place. Both are access
ible, being readily reached from North
Bank trains and the Columbia River
highway via the Hood River-White
Salmon ferry system.
Located on a high promontory at the
mouth ofhe White Salmon river, The
Eyrie commands number of unsur
passed views. The orcbarda of the
Hood River valley lie before the eye
of the visitor like the opened map of
landscape gardener who would cbarm
you with bis designs. For 20 miles to
the east and almost as many to the
west may be seen the Columbia as it
cuts itaay through the Cascades. If
notified in advance Mr. Reckera will
meet hia guests at the railway station
or wharf. Aside from the main inn,
individual cottages and modern tent
accommodations, completely and most
comfortably furnished, have been pro
vided. An up to date tennis court
croquet grounds and comfortable lawn
awings await the guest. Ample ac
commodations for housing private auto
mobiles are available, and a complete
livery service may be had on call.
Saddle horses may be secured for those
enjoying this .recreation. The Eyrie
table is set from its own garden patch
es and milk and cream from Mr. Reck
era' private dairy.
In the Hood River valley, probably
because the residents have been too
busy growing apples, but a single sum
mer resort, the Cottage Farm of Mrs.
Alma Howe, has been in continuous
existence during the past 10 years.
The Wau Guin Guin hotel, on the bluffs
of the Columbia at the head of a
beautiful water falls of that name,
waa formerly operated by Robert
Rand, who, however, retired from the
hotel business four years ago. He
continues to make the place his home,
and attracts the attention of all motor
ists over the Columbia River highway
with his uniquely laid out old fashioned
flower gardens.
Cottage Farm is in the midst ef the
West Side orchards, a mile from the
city on the Belmont road. The main
building of the resort is surrounded by
fruit trees and flowering shrubs, and
apple, peach and other fruit trees grow
around the tent cottages Mrs. Howe
has found it necessary to erect to ac
commodate her increasing guest list
Virgin fir and pine trees grow in the
ample backyard. While her neighbors
were uprooting all trees, Mrs. Howe
stood alone an exponent of conserva
tion on a small scale.
Mrs. Howe,formerly a trained nurse
in Portland, purchased the tract on
which she now operates her summer
resort in pioneer daya. The place was
opened primarily, on a email acale, for
the accommodation of patients needing
a rest in the region of scenic and pas
toral appeal. For a decade her guests
from Portland, and all of her guests
have become her close personal friends,
have been gradually increasing.
Thomas W. Lawson has made several
pilgrimaes to the Hood River valley.
seeking the seclusion and quiet of the
Cottage Farm. Henrietta, a pure
blood, enormous Berkshire sow, pre
sented to Mrs. Howe by the noted Bos-
tonian and writer of "Frenzied Fi
nance," changed her residence from
the Prineville stock farm of Mr. Law- j
aon to Cottage Farm, and now she and
her children in clean, well kept sties,
form an attraction for the many chil
dren who spend the summers at the
orchard resort.
Mrs. F. C. House, another West Side
resident whose place is on Avalon
Way. a lute more than a mile from the
eity, has begun to keep summer board
era. Accommodationa have been pro
vided for a limited number of guests
at "Home wood," an attractive place
in the Udell community.
When the orchard boom was at its
height a young Yale graduate, Homer
A. Rogers, attracted by the acenery or
Mount Hood, purchased a place at the
summit of China Hill in the very
southern end of the Upper Hood River
Valley. Mr. Kogera spent a portion or
five years in the Swiss' Alps. He has
climbed all the principal peaks of the
Alps. Mountaineering has become his
life study. Mr. Rogers made a poor
orchardist He admits it, and three
years ago he conceived the idea of
turning his bome into a lodge, where
the man or woman seeking thrills of
the wonderful sights of the Cascades
might come and be entertained. The
visitor to Mount Hood Lodge, as Mr.
Roeers has named his place, may spend
an entire summer visiting surrounding
points of interest and still not have
seen them all.
From the porches and lookouts at
Mount Hood Lodge one can glimpse, in
addition to Mount Hood, which looms
at his very back, three other North
western snow peaks, Adams, Kainier
and St Helens. Mr. Rogers has added
to his attractiona the sport of horse
back riding. Not a gallop over smooth
country roads, yet good roads are
available in the floor or the upper val
ley orchard district, if this ia desired.
The lodge boniface, philosopher and
guide takes his patrons on the most al
luring trails through the government
national forest, at the edgea of thou
sand feet chasms, over brawling moun
tain torrents, to the feet of glaciers,
the birtbplacee of Northwestern rivers,
and even over the anowfielda of old
Mount Hood.
Cloud Cap Inn heretofore has been
the only point to which the visitor ap
proaching the snow peak of Hood from
the north side could travel to nfid hotel
accommodations. It will continue to
draw its patrons because of ita vantage
point at the very snowline, but it haa
its drawbacks, since it can be operated
only from July 1 until Sepember. Snow
fills the roads till July and by Septem
ber mountain storms are imminent.
Still, some of the best times for ascent
of Mount Hood come in September,
after the first rains and the smoky
base has cleared from the atmosphere.
Mr. Rogers haa discovered a new
passage to the top of Hood, by way of
Rocky Butte. Hia lodge is open at all
seasons of the year. Indeed, from
Mount Hood Lodge parties from Port
land set out to enjoy the thrill of
coaating and skiing on the vaat snow
fields in wintertime. Because of ita
being the hub of a diveristy of moun
tain scenery, giving opportunity to the
man or woman of almost any tempera
ment to gratify hia desires, whether it
be the more strenuous rides through
the dense forests and over the rough
trails or simply to enjoy a rest in the
rural district Mount Hood Lodge is
winning great popularity.
Hood River county authorities, aided
by the eitizena of city and orchard dis
trict are promoting the construction
of a new highway to the anowline at
Cooper's spur. When this route, elim
inating the old, steep toll road to Cloud
Cap Inn, haa, been completed, it may
safely be predicted that a new and im
posing mountain hotel will arise on
Hood's side.
Hood River folk andjgovernment for
estry officials are also working toward
the end that an automobile road may
be built to Lost Lake. Scenes here,
according to W. T. Andrews, a logging
engineer of the forestry department in
Portland, are not surpassed in splendor

pates in the Festivities
It was rare weather Tuesday. A
briliant sun waa prodigal with its rays
in a cloudless sky. Every atom oft
smoky haze had been cleared away by
recent precipitation, and the silver
sheen on the hoary sides of old Mount
Hood and Mount Adams were fairly
dazzling. It was just warm enough
for comfort
Hood River's Fourth of July celebra
tion, although for : the most part im
promptu, was highly successful. A
large crowd waa in town, local resi
dents having been joined by many vis
itors from Underwood and White Salm
on. The crowd was hilarious and rough
at times, but peace officers found no
trouble. In fact, Officer Carson did not
find it necessary to appoint an assist
ant. While a tentative set schedule had
been provided for events that had been
planned, this was upset at every stage
of the program of the Fourth. When
the parade of doll buggies, exponents
of preparedness and Civil war veterana
waa ready at the point of assembling,
it had been expected that Dr. F. C.
Brosius would lead the files of march
ers. Dr. Brosius' horse, however, was
not resdy. Master Russell Volstorff.
son of Mr. and Mrs. J. F. Volstorff,
rode up on a tiny bicycle. Across his
breast was a red sash. "Here's the
officer of the day," shouted some vet
eran trooper of the Civil war. The
suggestion registered with Dr. Bro
sius, who instructed young Volstorff to
lead the marchers.
The feature of the young boy trun
dling earnestly at the head of the gray
haired veterans, wss truly one of the
most impressive features of the day.
Uphill and downhill over Hood River'a
steep streets the young officer of the
day kept time with the music and did
not once change his speed. He was a -
tired but proud little boy when the pa
rade was ended.

did not arrive in time for the day's ora
tion. Rev. J. L. Allen, pastor of the
Heights Baptist church, delivered a
short address on "Americanism."
Following the formal speaking, mem-
bera of the hose companies of the Vol
unteer fire d'partment participated in
races on Cascade avenue. A near seri
ous accident occurred when one of the
hose carts ran down aome of the boys
dragging the heavy apparatus. Some
of the firemen were dragged for about
60 feet over the rough pavement. No
injuries were sustained to the bodies or
the firemen. Their "pants," however.
were total wrecks.
On the afternoon of the Fourth the
baseball team defeated a team of Jap
anese playera from Seattle.- The tame.
lasting for six innings, resulted in a
score of 84 in favor of the Hood Riv
er boys. The Nipponese declared aa
they left to eaten the train, that they
were just getting warmed up, when the
time came for them to depart
The populace then repaired to the
sloughs of the Columbia to witness
some novel water fights and log rolling
contests.
The last event of the day was a new
feature of entertainment for Hood Riv
er and one that proved decidedly popu
lar. From a standing start different
makes and models of automobiles raced
from Columbia street up Ninth street
to Sherman avenue. It is probable
that the motor races created more in
terest than any other event of the day.
The big Fourth dance at the Cascade
avenue skating rink lasted until 2
o'clock yesterday morning.
Much or the success or the day must
be credited to the Hood River band.
Winners in the atheltic events were
aa follows: Logrolling contest, Mai-1
colm Button ; boys' 50 yard dash, Bicks ;
boys' 75 yard dash, Hudsop; girls' 50
