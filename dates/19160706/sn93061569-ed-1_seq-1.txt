$20,000 LOSS WHEN
FIRE DESTROYS GARAGE
Home of Fords Reduced to
Junk in Blaze that Threat
ened Entire Block; Sev
en Cars Burned
Fire, originating in the vulcanizing
room just a few minutes after noon
Monday completely destroyed the Pi
oneer garage, all its equipment, tubes
and casings, valued at several thou
sand dollars, hundreds of dollars
-worth of parts and accessories, seven
motor cars and two residences belong
ing to the Mr. and Mrs. L.A. Wikoff
and their son Allen.
The fire was one of the hottest and
threatened to be the most disasterous
ever to visit Claytom A varying wind
whipped the flames to many angles
and menaced, for atime, the entire
east residence section of the city. y
The volunteer fire department, with
assistanceof others fought in the ter
rific heat and smoke, and handicapped
with low water pressure for a stren
uous hour before the fire was under
control and only then after it had con
sumed the two dwellings adjoining the
garage. The most remarkable feature
of the fire was its intense heat and its
short duration. At 12 o'clock the me
chanics "knocked off" for lunch. At
1 o'clock they were without a job and
theii employers without a home and
the business which they had spent
years building reduced to smoldering
junk.
Many cars were in the garage when
the fire was discovered. All of them
were run out except seven consisting
of two Chalmers touring cars, Mrs
Wikoff's coupe, Allen's racing Ford, a
Maxwell belonging to H. L. Simpson,
' white Tanner's truck and a stock Ford.
broken Furniture
Every family living in the same
"block sustained some loss from the.de-!
struction of household goods which
were moved to the street. Many
handsome pieces of furniture were
broken by volunteers whose intentions
were' good but whose execution was
far from gentle.
The Dr. Bristol property had a nar
row escape from total destruction. No
one in the crowd would not have given
more than four bits for it at any time
from the beginning of the fire until
12:45. Aside from the burning of the
fence and out-biuldings there was lit
tle loss.
Little Insurance
Mr. Wikoff places the loss as more
than $20,000 with les than $3,000 in
surance on the entire property.
The Pioneer is already arranging
for business in its building directly
east of the Clayton Garage and Auto
Co. The service station is now repdy.
Machinist Coming
R. E. Oven, of Dallas, has been em
ployed to take charge of the mechan
ical work in the Pioneer's new quar
ters. Allen says he comes recommend
ed as a motorcar man of many years
experience and as one of the best in
the south, having been ablet o secure
him because of the advantages this
part of the country offers in the way
of temperature.

WITH CRIPPLED TEAM
CLAYTON GRABS GAME
Old Enemy Defeated When
Celebrators Hammer Two
Pitchers for 11 Hits
Texhoma Wins 2 of 3
Clayton again won from its first
enemy when the lads took Dalhart
down the column July 4th to the tune
of 7 to 1. Bill Lynch started the game
for Dalhart. He was hit freely by the
Clayton lads and four runs were piled
up in the first three innings. Page re
leived Lynch at the beginning of the
fourth and the locals soaked him for
three more runs. There were a total
of 11 hits, clean ones, gathered by
Clayton off the two pitchers. But one
error was chalked against the locals
fielding. The game ended with the
score 7 to 1.
The second days' game waa called
off on account of wét grounds. V
Clayton had a badly crippled team
and was worse crippled at the close of
the game, third baseman Mattox be
ing sent to the bench with a badly
sprained ankle.
Texhoma Takes Two of Three Games
Clayton did not fare so well in three
games with the slugging Texhoma
bunch, Friday, Saturday and Sunday.
The Oklahoma giants took the first
game after an exciting session by a
score of 10 to 6. Waters was unable
to work the puzzling racket on these
lads that characterized his work at
Trinidad and th boys from across the
line punctured him for scattering hits,
which coupled with loose support lost
the game for Clayton.
In the second game the locals came
back and worked reverse english on
the sluggers and won the game 5 to
This game failed to produce the
excitement of the former one. The
crowd was tired of waiting and the
wind made life unbearable during the
first two innings. The game was
Clayton's all the way through. Morton
worked and pitched good ball.
Waters started Sunday's game.
Again the visitors rapped his kinks
and Morton relieved the southpaw.
Clayton threatened to overcome Tex-
homa's lead of 6 to 4 in the eighth
with one down and Waters advancing
from first to third on Thompson's sac
rifice. Texhoma short tossed the ball
to second to catch Waters. It was the
concensus of opinion that Waters "was
safe a mile." The umpire called him
out. Speeches were made, joint de
bates held, the grandstand wanted to
fight and the umpire stuck. Texhoma
refused to finish the game unless the
decision held.- During fifteen minutes
rag chewing the Texhoma twirler was
getting back in form. Umpire Clark
addressed the crowd calling all bets
off. That ended the agony also the
game so far as scoring was concerned.
After this game the local Spanish-
American team trimmed the Mt. Dora
lads in a hit and rung ame with a
score of 19 to 11.
. Too Much Smoke
The report reaches us that in the
game July 4th between Clapham and
Barney, the latter quit because Mc
Clure pitching for Clapham had too
much smoke. It is reported that Mc-
Clure hit one of the Barney boys,
knocking him out. After the accident
each batter was shy of the twirler.
Barney petitioned the umpire to call
the game off.
Fred J. Hoelderle, manager of the
Ohio ranch near Hayden, was in the
city several days this week' looking
after business matters.
Adolph Wenz was in from his
ranch nenr Pasamonte the first of the
week and took out al arge load of
supplies.
Mrs. Wagner, aunt of Mrs. Tom
Stoddard and Leonard Warner, her
brother, both from St. Louis, .arrived
in the city the latter part of last week
for a visit. They are both excellent
musicians, Mrs. Warner playing the
violin and young Warner the piano.
TWV treated the. audience at the
V 'n last Saturday evening to some
Contestant Injured
John Iker, living about ten miles
south 'of Clayton, was brought to
town last night from Clapham in a
very serious condition caused by a
fall from his horse. He was attend
ing the celebration at Clapham, and
had entered the "Gallo" or chicken
race, horse-back and in company with
another party was running at full
speed when (he two horses collided,
throwing him violently to the ground,
the horse falling on him. The other
man jumped from his horse and
was unhurt. When Iker was picked
up he was unconscious and has re
mained so untill 3 p. m. today. It is
feared that his neck is broken and
very little hopes are held for his re
covery. He is at Miss Rope's hospital
under the care of Dr. Winchester.
Although Clayton did not observe
the Fourth Union county in general
put in a busy day. Clapham held
a two day session with plenty of
amusement to entertain the big
crowds that attended.
About 1500 people attend the big
two days at the Dish Rag crossing on
the Corrumpa in the Stubblefield
grove. This grove affords an ideal
place for picnic celebrations. Cars
were there in flocks and everybody
had well-filled lunch boxes and every
body ate more than was good for
them.
Racing, ball-games and dances made
up the program. One of the best races
was the girls horse .which was won by
Miss Irene Stubblefield.
y Caught In Rain
A big crowd of rooters went to Dal
hart to celebrate and help the Clay
ton chaps win. The storm in the eve
ning marooned the visitors who were
forced to stay in Dalhart all night.
Beds were not to be had, and the male
celebrators had to camp in barber
chairs, on pool tables, in the tailor
shops, furniture stores and on the city
scales. v
Horse Got His Goat
Fulgencio C. de Baca and family,
went to Rosebud, Monday to spend the
Fourth with Mr. de Baca's parents.
The people of that section had a big
celebration, all kinds of I racing,
dancing, end roping contest.-!. Ful
gencio would have won the goat-roap-ing
contest, only his horse "got his
goat" just as ho was hastily tying it,
and walked off with it. It only took
him 25 seconds to rope it.
The families of Mr. and Mrs. Ek-
lund, Mr. and Mrs. R. Q. Palmer, Mr.
and Mrs. Dudley Snyder, Mr. and
Mrs. Simon Herzstein, and Miss Ven
día Eklund and Leonard Herzstein,
motored out to the Eklund ranch on
the Corrumpa to spend the Fourth.
They had some very exciting times.
All went in bathing and Mrs. Simon
Herzstein and Master "Junior" fell in
the creek. They had a famous picnic
dinner and in the evening the children
cnteretained themselves and their
elders with fire-works.
Mr. and Mrs. Underwood chaperoned
a jolly party the Fourth of July on a
picnic. They had it too. They went
above Dishrag crossing to the spring.
All took bathing suits and tried their
skill at swimming in a big water-hole
there. Of course a big dinner with
lots of ice-cream for dessert furnished
one of the principal events. The par
ty was composed of Misses Ruby
Thornton, Robine Woods, Messrs. Kel
ley, Clark, McCoy, and Mr. and Mrs.
Underwood.
w Mrs. Granville was hostess to the
Auction Club Saturday afternoon of
last week. Mrs. aErl Messenger held

LATEST FROM MEXICO
INDICATES FRIENDLINESS
Sassy Tone Not Evident in
Carranza's Last Letter to
U. S. Revokes Order to
Withdraw T roops
Washington, July 5. The reply of
the de facto government of Mexico to
the demands of the United States, con
ciliatory in tone and giving asurances
of a desire to reach a friendly adjust
ment of the difficulties between the
two countries was delivered at the
state department today by a Mexican
embassy attache.
As soon as a translation of the
i Spanish text could be made it was sent
to the white house. Until Secretary
Lansing and President Wilson have
had an opportunityt o confer, there
will be no informal comment.
State department officials did not
atempt to conceal the fact tha they
considered he noe mos sasifactory and
likely o remove all danger of war.
No Superfluities
Brief and fre from all superfluous
language of diplomacy, the commun
ication points to the release of the
American tropers captured at Carri
zal as proof of the Mexican govern
ment's sincere desire to avoid a con
flict; states as the outstanding issue
the reasonable belief of the United
States tha he insecuriy of its fron
tier is a source of difficulty, and on
the other hand, the belief of the Mex
ican government that the presence of
American troops in Mexico is a tres
pass on that country's sovereignty and
the immediate cause of trouble. As
suianccs are given that the de facto
government will employ every effort
to prevent incidents which would ag
gravate the situation and the hope is
expressed that the United States will
do likewise.
Now Mexico Onlv State West of Mis
sissippi With Strictly Military
Institute
Roswelk N. M., July 0. It is a fact
not generally knwn that New Mexi
co, one of the two newest states in
the union, is the only state west of
the Misu:.?ippi river that maintains
:i strictly military school. Ths school
s the Ntw Mexico Miliary Institute at
Roswell, and not rnly is it the onlv
institution of its kind in all the west,
but it enjoys the added distinction of
being recognized by the war depart
ment as one of the ten best military
schools in the entire country.
The foresight of the New Mexico
legislature in establishing a military
school for the training of young men
to meet any emergency that may come
aoout tnrough the country being in
volved in war is just now getting to
be fully appreciated and recognized.
Formerly a military training was
considered by many parents to be su
perfluous, but now that the entire
country is ringing with the demands
of the people for preparedness for na
tional defense, attention is being call
e I to the fact that the New Mexico
Military Institute has for many years
been turning out young men fully
equipped to uphold their country's
honor in the field if the call to arms
should come.
The point is made by the authorities
of the school, however, that the in
stitute is doing far more than prepare
young men for war it is preparing
them for the battle of life in time of
peace. The discipline of the school,
the healthful physical training that its
routine accomplishes, the excellent
moral atmosphere and the high aca
demic standard that it maintains all
combine to constitute an education
that is the best possible equipment a
young man can have, no matter to
what sphere of life he may be called
after leaving school.
In every way New Mexico has
cause to be proud of the New Mexico
Military Institute.
It is the best ad-
vertisement the state
could have
he best inducement she. could offer 0
outsiders to come and bring their fam-
k i-
