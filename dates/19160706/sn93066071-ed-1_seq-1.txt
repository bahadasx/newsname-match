rather sorry for your brother. Uo
looked so lonely and sick."
"Uo's gcttlh' better cery day," Jim
said. "Doctor Gurney says so. There's

"IIes Just queer. Sometimes ho'll say

ho says. 'Well, now, that depends
that depends,' he says. Ho talks slow
like that, you know. 'I'll tell you what
time I want tho car, George,' he says,
'If you'll tell me what you think of this

Mary pondered upon this. "He might

S. A. MOURIQUAND FOR COMMISSIONER1
OF SECOND DISTRICT
. Jn this irsuc will bo found the an
nouncement o! S. A Mourinuand, of
Riverside, for Cjunty Commissioner of
tho Second District. He is asking for
the Democratio nomination in the Au
gust primaries.
Mr. Mouriquand filed on a claim in
the ""Jtlverside neighborhood some
twelve years ago and hr.s cultivated
the same successfully and continuously
from llit tlmo to tho present. His
record ns n citizen and as n man of in
tegrity during these y ears is without a
blot and is open for imectigaticn to
the Voters of the district.
Prior to his settling in this state, he
was employed for many years as an ex
pert bookkeeper In a large mercantile
establishment In the east and is capa
ble of auditing any set ol books in the
county. In short he it a competent
business man as well as a succeFiful
farmer. Ills experience has been such
that he would be a valuable man to the
entire county, should he be nominated
and elected. He has no ax to grind, is
running not as a representative of any
clique, but has ths Interest ol the
county at heart, and his sole aim in
seeking the office Is that he may be of
benefit to his fellow citizens.
Not as an apology, but as an ex
planation, wo wish to state that the
present Issue of the Herald does not
come up to our usual standard. Last
week we Issued a sixteen pager jtnd
the force was compelled to work night
and "day In order to get-it out in the
short time at our disposal. Then, as
everyone knows, there was tho Cele
bration o n Tuesday and Wednesday
and it was almost impossible to do any
work those days, when everyone else
was celebrating and the noise was so
loud and continuous that type-setting
could scarcely even be attempted. As
a result of all these circumstances we
feel ihat no apology is necessary. You
celebrated so did we.

' An immense lot of debris paper,
confetti, lemon peels and a score of
other kinds of trash littered the
streets this morning, as an aftermath
of the Celebration. A force was put to
work early and the refuse cleaned up.
A wagon-was put on by the committee
to haul the stuir out of town. It Is
very much to their credit thnt they
took prompt action and Is characteris
tic of their thorough going methods
throughout the big event.
Mr, Cooper arranged Feinberg'e show
windows so attractively and tastefully
for the 4th and 3th, that they drew the
admiration of all pasiers-by.
Faced by demands from the conductors, engineers, firemen and brakemen
that would impose on the country an additional burden in transportation costs of,
$100,000,000 a year, the railroads propose that this wage problem be settled by
reference to an impartial Federal tribunal.
With these employes, whose efficient service is acknowledged, the railroads
have no differences that could not be considered fairly and decided justly by such
a public body.
Railroads Urge Public Inquiry and Arbitration
The formal proposal of the railroads to the employes for the settlement ol
the controversy is as follows:
"Our conferrnert hire dtrnonttratcd that nt cannot harmonlic our difltrtncra of opinion and that eventually tht
mattcra in rontrovcroy mutt'bf paiicd upon by olhrr and dmntcrcttcd aetnriti. Tlicitforr, t ptopou that jour
propoiaU and thr proposition of tht railways b dupoxd of by one or llic oilier of the lollowing methods:
1, Preferably by ailbmitiion to the Interstate Commerce Commission, the only tribunal vthicli, by reason of Its
accumulated information bearing on "railway conditions and its control ol the revenue of die railways, is in a posi
tion to consider and protect the lights and equities of all I he interests affected, and to ioide additionalreventit
- necessary to meet the added cost of operation in case your proposals are found by the Commission to be just and
reasonable; or, in the event the Interstate Commerce Commission cannot, under existing laws, act in the premises,
Ihat we jointly request Congress to take such action as may be ntcessary to enable the Commission to consider and
jtroniotlf disuoie of the Questions involved: or
f . By aibltrariou In accordance wltfi ffi pioeislunt of the Ytitttl taw frfi Wenfnrfs ti
Leaders Refuse Offer and Take Strike Vote
Leaders of the train service brotherhoods, at the joint conference held in New
York, June 1-15, refused the offer of the railroads to submit the issue to arbitration
or Federal review, and the employes are now voting on the question whether
authority shall be given these leaders to declare a nation-wide strike.
The, Interstate Commerce Commission is proposed by the railroads as the
public body to which this issue ought to be referred (or these reasons:
No other body with such an intimate knowi'dgc
of railroad conditions has such an unquestioned posi
tion in the public confidence.
The rates the railroads may charge the public for
transportation are now largely rued by this Govern
ment board.
Out of rvrry dollar received by the railroads from
(he public nearly one-half is paid diirclly to the em
ployes as wages; and the money to pay increased wages
can come from no other source than the rates paid
bv the public
The Interstate Commerce Commission, with its con
trol over rates, is in a position to make a complete
investigation and tender such derision as would pro
tect the interests of the railroad employes, the owners
of the railroads, and the public.
A Question For the Public to Decide
The raifroad6 feel that they have no right to grant a wage preferment of
$100,000,000 a year to these employes, now highly paid and constituting only
one-fifth of all the employes, without a clear mandate from a public tribunal that
shall determine the merits of the case after a review of all the facts.
The single issue before the country is whether this controversy is to be settled by an
impartial Government inquiry or by industrial warfare.
