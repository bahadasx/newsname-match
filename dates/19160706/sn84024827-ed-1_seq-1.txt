(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON, July 5. Early
resumption of friendly diplomat
ic relations with the de facto gov
ernment of Mexico to the end
that peace and order may be re
stored in northern K'exico and
along the border is epeeed heie
to be the next step of the United
States in its relations with its
southern neighbor. The crisis
precipitated by Villa's raid on Co
lumbus, New Mexico, and culmi
nating in the fight at Carrizal,
Mexico, between American and
Mexican troops appeared tonight
to have been dissipated by an am
icable note from General Carraiv
za, presented during the day by
his ambassador-designate here,
Elesio Arrendondo.
U. S. To Negotiate '
The note proposes that the differ '
ences between the governments be
settiea ny mediation or ny oireci ne-
gotiations. It is remarkable for its
brevity, its restrained and friendly
tone, and for the absolute lark of any
of tfie strong, even insolent language
which characterized the last two com
munications from the de facto govern
ment. It treats as a closed incident,
the exchange of unfriendly communi
cations, which brought war almost
within sight.
Lansing On Vacation
No formal comment on the note
was obtainable from State Depart-;t,on
meni oniciais. a copy was iorwara-
'
ed to tlie White House. Immediately
upon its receipt and President Wilson
will determine on the course to be
pursued. The fact that Secretary
Lansing completed preparations today
for a month's vacation to begin Fri
day is regarded, as significant, iiow
ever. of a fueling on his part that the
crisis is over.
Negotiate Directly
As a matter of general principle,
the Washington government always
has favored mediation of any dispute
suitable for such procedure. There j er wa8 foun(i after the tragedy, leav
is every indication, however, that in i tng 0iy tne explanation that Orpet
ine present insiance, u wn. De aeem-
lunncomiTig i
negotiations directly with the Carran- J
za government.
Members of the Latin-American dip
lomatic corps here are expected to
make inquiries soon as to the atti
tude of the Washington government
in view of fie statement of the Mexi
can foreign office that it awaits only
a decision as to whether mediation or
I direct negotiations would be prefera
ble. Indications tonight were that the
inquiries would be met with assuranc
es that the two governments had
reached a stage where they would not
' find it necessary to call upon the
friendly services of their neighbor
states.
Polk And Arredondo
It is not known whether a formal
reply to General Carranza's note is
contemplated. Diplomatic usage does i
not call for one, and many officials
feel that more can be accomplished
through informal discussion between j
Mr. Arredondo and Counsellor Polk :
who will act as secretary in Mr. Lan-
sing's absence, than could be hoped j
for in any other way. It is under-;
stood that Mr. Arredondo plans to call j
at the department tomorrow to say
good-bye to Secretary Lansing before
his departure for his vacation. Prob
ably the preliminary steps necessary
for the inauguration of the informal
discussion would le taken then. State!
department officials appeared entirely.

The very root of the two theories '

Dr. Wesener gave a wealth of rea-

was taken in powdered form. He as -
serted also in reply to a hypothetical
question that the cyanide available to ,

German Losses 60.000.
It is estimated that the German
losses in the battle of the Somme.

The caoture of puns has been
comparatively small, because the
Germans, in anticipation of the
offensive, withdrew their big ar

German Line Mjy Break.
According to aerial observation on
the. French front in the direction of
Peronne. there are now only three
more trench systems between the
French and the open country, and if
a break can be made in the German
lines here, it would be extremely seri
ous for the Germans, who are doubt
less hurrying up rtnforceinenta to
n'ake secure the threatened point.
The Germans are sending reinforce
ments to the battlefield from as far
as Verdun and Lens, and it is thougbt
that the continued heavy German at
tacks on the Ileuse. may be intended
to conceal important movement of
troop shell ind the German line.
A report from Holland indicates
that the Germans have prepared a
