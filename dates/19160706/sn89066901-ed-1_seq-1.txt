Southern Route Inspected
With a view of obtaining first
band information as to the con
dition of the southern route of
the proposed Ozark trail connect
ing Springfield and St. Louis, E.
L. Sanford, recently elected vice

Association ; to represent Ml:
sonri, and W."HT Seed,'' higEway

pects soon to make a similar trip

another subsequently over the
proposed compromise route from
Salem east to Iron Mountain,
thence , over the old Telegraph
road into St. Louis. The pro
posed third route would elimi
nate several of the towns at the
extreme east end of the southern
route.
The tour over the southern
route was made with a view of
ascertaining a definite knowledge
of the condition of the roads in
order that he may be able as a
vice president of the Ozark Trails
Association to offer auch sugges
tions to good roads enthusiasts
along the route as may be desired
and that he might better pro
mote the building of roads in
Missouri. , vV
While several bad stretches of
road were encountered on the
southern, route, Mr,' Sanford
said, boosters along that route
deserve much credit for the pro
gress made during the past year

which .make up the highway.
Every effort to promote the
completion of the southern route
will be made by , Mr, Sanford
and other good roads boosters

official route of the Ozark trail
connecting Springfield and St.
Lcuis will be designated by

sic; and no one will be' allowed
to enter the contest who plays
by note or who calls the fiddle a

necessary, as all fiddlers who
come and are' eligible will be
cordially ' and 11 hospitably- -re
ceived. It is propoed and plan
ned to be the largest gathering
