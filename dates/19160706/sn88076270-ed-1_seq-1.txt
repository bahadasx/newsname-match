SAFE ENGINEERING
FOR PONTOON BRIDGE
DIRECTORS AND COMMISSIONER
HEAR REPORT DISASTER TO
UPSTREAM BRIDGES
At a joint meeting: of the directors
of the Missouri River Bridge Co.,
and the Commercial Club, held Fri
day, June 30th. 1916 at 4:30 p. m.,
report was made by Jos. Wegley as
to the causes of the pontoon bridges
at Wolf Point and Mondak being:
washed out. Mr. Wegley reported
that the loss of the Wolf Point bridge
was due 1st to the caving in of a
large portion of the bank submerging
several boats which in turn pulled
others down with them 2nd. several
of the boats were of an old style with
square fronts which allowed floating
flin^be|rs to become lodged against
tnem and which eventually caused
them to sink. These boats were be
ing replaced by new boats with a
pitched and which allows any floating
objects to slid eunder the boats 3rd
the boats were not built water tight
on top and the wash from the water
backing up against the square ends
of the boats caused the boats to fill
and sink. The bridge at Mondak was
lost due to the fact that the boats were
not covered on top thus allowing the
water to wash over and fill the boats
2nd. the cables holding the boats were
anchored to the bottom of the river
thus causing a downward pull as the
water arose and which eventually
caused the boats to become submerg
ed.
Neither of these bridges were
anchored to an overhead cable and
thus had no support from above. Had
over head cables been installed it is
safe to say that the bridges would still
be in place.
The loss of those bridges were a
good thing in as far as Williston is
concerned as it has given the Bridge
Co. an opportunity to note the weak-
In the plans which are

devices provided. The officers of the
Bridge Co. state that the plans when
completed are to be submitted to a
competent consulting engineer for
final approval. Every precaution pos
sible is being taken bv the Bridge

perience of others there is every rea
son to believe that the Williston pon

Letter from Congressman Norton
recently received by the Bridge Co.,
states that the bill granting the Co.
the right to construct a bridge across
the Missouri River, has passed the
house and is expected to come up be
fore the senate this week and will be

Lumber for the bridge is on the way
and should reach Williston in the near
future. Construction work will be
started immediately upon the arrival
of the lumber.
The Williston Commercial Club is
lending every aid possible to the

of the bridge is looked for this sum

The citizens of Minot have been

The 4th Was Quiet
Day In Our Village
In consideration of the Third An
nual Corn and Alfalfa Picnic, which
is an all Williams County occasion,
and will be held at the Experimental
Farm July 14th, Williston did not
celebrate Independence Day, but her
citizens attended the large number of
interesting celebrations and picnics
held in the surrounding towns and
country places.
Springbrook, Wildrose and Cotton
wood Lake had splendid programs of
events, putting on the usual celebra
tion features with some new ones
added. Springbrook had an unusual
ly large crowd and a fine program of
sports. Springbrook and Epping
played ball, excellent music was fur
nished by the local band, and Attor
ney H. W. Braatelien of Williston de
livered a thoughtful and timely ad
dress.
Both Wildrose and Cottonwood
Lake were favored with large crowds
and had plenty doing all day for
amusement. The exceptionally good
Crosby Band played at Wildrose. At
torney Wm. G. Owens delivered pa
triotic addresses at both places speak
ing at Cottonwood Lake in the after
noon and Wildrose in the evening.
His efforts are spoken of as being ex
ceptionally good and replete with in
terest.
At Gromatka's grove the annual
Good Roads Picnic was held, which
was attended by about two hundred
people from the surrounding country
and Williston. As unusually pleasant
day was spent with plenty to eat and
plenty to entertain. W. N. Dickinson
and Geo. Gilmore delivered patriotic
addresses that were well received.
Secretary F. A. Morrill of the Wil
liston Commercial Club spoke on good
roads. The Rose Hill team won an
interesting ball game from a Wil
liston team by a score of 10 to 9.
A bowery dance was held in the even

Several other picnic parties were
made up. At one held in Muddy Val

Miss Florence A. Dennett who has

position and announces that she will
open a commercial college about Sep

Miss Dennett has gained and en

COUNTY CORN AND ALFALFA
GATHERING, 14TH
Great interest is being taken in the
Third Annual Williams County Corn
and Alfalfa picnic, which will be held
at Williston Sub-Station Farm Fri
day, July 14th. The first of these
annual affairs, it will be remembered,
was held at the H. A. Nelson farm at
Nesson in July 1914, and was a fine
success with an attendance of 1500 to
1800 people.
Williston Graphic
Last year the second picnic was
held at Old Fort Buford and was fa
vored by even a larger attendance, it
being' estimated that 3500 people were
present. This year an attendance of
5000 is confidentially expected. The
managers of the Williams County
Better Farming Association through
the Williston Township Farmers club
cordially invite all to this important
event, particularly farmers from ad
joining counties in both North Da
kota and Montana. It is suggested
that families bring lunchr baskets and
be prepared for gn all-day's good
time. Free automobile transporta
tion between Williston and the farm
will be furnished by the Williston
Commercial Club. Those having the
affair in charge are making careful
preparations and sparing no efforts
for the success of the occasion and the
pleasure and comfort of those who
attend it.

After Glendive, Minot
—Week of Base Ball
Yesterday afternoon Secretary Cut
ting came to terms with Minot for
two three game series, the first to be
played here.
The four-game series at Glendive
was finished yesterday with another
victory for our boys. The 4th of July
game was a corker that took ten in
nings to decide. The scores and Wil
liston batteries were:
July 2—Williston 6 Glendive 4. For
Williston, Ruyle and Immings.
July 3—Williston 6 Glendive 7. For
Williston, Rolls and Immings.
July 4—Wiliston 6 Glendive 5. For
Williston, Marshall and Immings.
July 5—Williston 8 Glenldive 3. For
Williston Seibert and Immings.
Williston has won 6 out of 70 with
Glendive with total runs of 49 to 36
for the Montana team.
Our Opportunes have played 21
games, wining 17 and losing 4—all to
Glendive.
Week of Baseball
Beginning next Saturday there will
be a solid week of baseball on the lo
cal grounds. Glendive July 8, 9, 10
and 11, then Minot on the 12th, 13th
and 14th, the last date being the day
of the Williams County Corn and Al
falfa picnic which will be held at the
Williston Experiment farm.
Minot will come with a reorganized
and much strengthened team de
termined to retrieve the former de
feats by our young men.
Patronize the Games
Seven games in a row will be at
tempted in the city and lovers of the
game are urged to keep up their
usual liberal patronage and help the
management with the heavy expense
that must be met.
June Favored By
Fine Growing Weather
Eighty degrees was the warmest
temperature experienced in the past
month and 37 the coolest. The mean
average was 58.6 or about five de
grees above normal.
The precipitation of the month
amounted to 4.73 inches or about one
inch more than normal. The moisture
account shows a plus, or balance, on
the right since January, of 1.20
inches.
There was slightly more wind and
a trifle more cloudy weather in June
than is usual but the month was one
of exceptionally good growing condi
tions as the splendid crops attest.
Company E Ex
tends It's Thanks
On behalf of Company E I wish
to extend to the people of Williston
our sincerest thanks for the words
of good cheer and financial aid. It is
indeed gratifying to know that our
friends have our interests at heart
and are as willing to do their part as
we are to do ours. And I can assure
you that your confidence has not been
misplaced. And should we be called
into actual service we will do ourbest
to the honor of the Flag, our country
and the city of Williston.

FOR HIE COMFORT OF
OUR BOYS IN BROWN
LISTS FOR A COMMISSARY FUND
FOR COMPANY "E" AT BANKS
DRUG STORES
The following subscription list—
which speaks for itself is now at all
the banks and Drug Stores of the
City and "Company "E" Fund" is
rapidly becoming a reality. Rather
than appoint a special canvassing
committee the presidents of the City
Commission and Commercial Club
have put the matter directly before
the people of Williston in the thought
that they would readily respond with
out personal solicitation. It requires
but a minute or two to step into any
of the banks or drug stores, sign the
subscription list and pav the amount,
which those business places have of
fered to receive on behalf of company
"E."
Williston has never yet failed to
show appreciation for company "E"
and all other organizations which are
a part of the city's life. No company
in the State had a more hearty "send
off" than Company "E" and no city
in the state will do more for its sol
dier boys than will Williston. Every
one wants to do his or her little part
and now that the opportunity is offer
ed there is every reason to believe
that by the end of the present week
the "Company^ *'E" Fund'1 will be al!
ready and waiting to meet the needs
and necessities of its 75 members.
"It is customary for the people of
each city where there is a militia com
pany to raise a "company fund"
whenever the company is called out
for active service. This fund is used
to buy all foodstuffs, other than the
regular army ration, fresh vegetables,
fruit, tobacco, handkerchiefs, reading
matter and the many incidentals which
the men of Company "E" will need.
Every City in North Dakota having
a militia company has already rais
ed such a fund. Minot leads with'
$1,200.00 fund, and the lowest fund
is $«00.00.
"Wiliston should raise not less than
$750.00 for the boys of Company "E"
and it should be raised at once as
they expect to leave Fort Lincoln
within a very few days. No one
should have to give any large amount
but everyone should give something.

Seven Big Games
At Williston
Beginning Saturday, July 8th and
continuing Sunday, Monday and Tues
day, the biggest base ball series held
so far this season will take place with
the Williston Opportunes and the
Glendive Cubs struggling for supre
macy. It is not over-stepping the
truth to say that these teams are the
best in western North Dakota and
eastern Montana. They have now
met in ten games, three played here
and seven at Glendive. Williston has
won six and Glendive four. With one
exception every game resulted in a
t'lose score. Glendive is strengthened
somewhat by the addition of new
pitchers since the first series at Wil
liston, and Williston is also stronger
by reason of one or two infielders.
Many people who have seen games be
tween these teams say the class of
base ball they put up is fully equal to
the smaller leagues and some games
in the big leagues. Anyone who at
tends will certainly get their money's
worth. The Saturday game will be
played 6:30, the Sunday game at 3
o'clock and Monday and Tuesday
games at 6:30, admission 35 cents fo
adults and 10 cents for children under
fifteen, with grand stand free and in
tended especially for ladies.
A traveling base ball aggregation
known as the "American Girls agreed
with Secretary Cutting to be here for
uncertain whether they will put in an
appearance or not. July 12th, 13th
and 14th Minot plays here, the 14th
being Williams County Picnic day.
July 15th and 16th the Opportunes
play a return series at Glasgow.
Schedules that had already been
made nrevented Williston from attend
1T!hi
which begins at Grand Forks July
10th. The proposition was not at
tractive from a financial point of view
even had the team been free to go as
the Tournament plan requires a team
to remain there seven or eight days
and the expense would eat up the
prize money even if first money was
won.

happiness and prosperity are hers.
Mexican Crisis Is
Believed To Be At End
Washington, July 5.—The crisis be
tween the United States and Mexico
virtually came to and end today when
a friendly and conciliatory note from
the de facto government was handed
Lansing and promptly communicated
to Wilson. There is no doubt in the
minds of officials th it the way has
been opened for an amicable adjust
ment of the dispute.
Lansing gave the impression that
Carranza's suggestion that there is
no pending question between the gov
ernments which cannot be readily an
swered by friendly negotiations, meets
with quick sympathy. High ofiicials
are much impressed with the com
plete change of tone shown in the
note.
Washington, July 5—Carranza's re
ply to the last two notes sent him by
the United States government was
delivered to the state department
early today by a Mexican embassy
attache.
The reply an announced yesterday
is conciliatory in terms, giving as
surances of a desire to reach a friend
ly adjustment of the difficulties be
tween the two countries. As soon as
the translation of the Spanish text
could be made it was sent to the White
House.
Until Secretary Lansing and Presi
dent Wilson have an opportunity to
confer there will be no formal com
ment. But some state department
officials did not attempt to conceal the
fact they considered the note most
satisfactory and likely to remove all
danger of war.
Brief and free from all superfluous
language of diplomacy, the communi
cation points to the release of the
American troopers captured at Car
rizal as proof of the Mexican govern
ment's sincere desire to avoid a con
flict, and states as an outstanding is
sue the reasonable belief of the United
States that the insecurity of its fron
tier is a source of difficulty, and, on
the other hand, the belief of the Mex
ican government that the presence of
American troops in Mexico is a tres
pass on the country sovereigrty and
the immediate cause of the trouble.
In offering to consider in "a quick,
practical way'' the remedy which
should be applied, the note gives no
tice that Mexico has accepted in prin
ciple the Latin-American offers of
mediation and awaits information if
the United States is disposed to ac
cept mediation or is still of the belief
that the same results may be obtain
ed by direct negotiations.
"Assurances arfe given' that in the
meantime the de facto government
will employ every effort to avert a
recurrence of the incidents which ag
gravate the situation. Hope is ex
pressed that the United States will
endeavor to have its military and civil
authorities do likewise. This is Car
ranza's reply to the demand for a
statement of his intentions. A specific
response to the question whether he
stands upon instructions to General
Trevino to attack American troops
moving other than northward is evad
ed. There is no mention of the repri
mand administered by Lansing in his
note on account of the offensive insin
uations and the language contained in
Carranza's last communication de
manding the recall of American
troops.
Although the note, which is less
than 600 words long, is signed by
foreign Minister Aguilar, ofiicials of
the Mexican embassy believe it was
dictated by Carranza himself.
San Antonio, Texas, July 5.—The
Third and Fourth Illinois infantry
reached here today and went into
camp. The first Wisconsin troops to
get into the south, A troop and A bat
tery, from Milwaukee, also arrived.

PRIMARY TOTALS
VOTE RECEIVED BY ALL CANDI
DATES ON THE BALLOTS
TOTAL VOTE NEAR 2,600
The non-partisan did not all "stick"'
on all offices in Williams county. Lynn
J. Frazier received 727 votes while
Tom Hall, also branded with the N-P
OK received 1359, A. T. Kraabel 1056
and John N. Ilagen 1078.
Excepting Usher L. Burdick, the
only candidate for a state office who
carried this county over a non-partisan
opponent is Carl O. Jorgenson who led
Carl R. Kositzky by 201.
Burdick carried his own county br
a plurality of 326 over Frazier, and a
majority of 230 over all opposition..
Incidentally. Frazier did not get a
vote in Burdick's farm-home precinct'
Stoney Creek, or his Williston home
precinct, the second ward. Burdick'*.
total in the county is 1053, Fraziejy
as mentioned, got 727, Fraine footed
up 58 and Smith drew 38.
The N-P legislative slate for the
41st district went through with only
one slipup—Von Eschen lost out. and
Fred Eckert was not only nominated
but came out second high on the whole
legislative list.
Coulter by One
On the republican county ticket
there were few contests and only on®'
close race—L. V. Coulter winning the
nomination for sheriff over his next
high opponent, former sheriff E. E.
Olson, Tby the slender plurality of one
vote. Ralph Williams came third and
Mackay fourth.
The republican nominess for coun
ty commissioner are: 2d district—
Larkin C. Hart. 3d dist.—Thomas
Huestievt. 4th dist.—Edward E.
Haugen. 5th dist.—Ole E. Ellingson^
W. A. Palmer and O .C. Ekeberg on.,
the democratic ballot had no oppo»i—
tion.
Taking the highest vote cast for
any office on each ticket (republicafn,
on governor democratic, on U. S.
senator socialist, on sheriff) as av
guide, the total primary vote of the
county was 2,523 but as there are al
ways some blanks on every office it
is probable that the actual total was
nearer 2,000. On account of numer
ous registrations outside the voter's
former party the estimate of the num
ber of republican ballots required fell
short in some precincts, causing
very unfortunate situation.
