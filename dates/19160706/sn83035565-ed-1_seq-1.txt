Tomorrow we celebrate the
Fourth and while some may not
accord due honor to the day, the
" writer intends to have a safe and
sane celebration thereof. One of
the things he has not failed to do
when the day comes is to read
' the Declaration of Independence,
V In this way he reads it once a
year at a stated time, which is
. - not toq of ten. and yet often en
t oueh to keep the" memory o it
green, as to what was done by
our roble and freedom-loving
sires. It may be wondered how
many of our people do a like pa
trioticduty. In these perilous
and troublous times may it not
be a good thing to do to take a
: retrospect of the events of the
past which led up to the estab
lishment of a popular govern
mtnt, which has served as a mo
del for many nations and has
been largely patterned after in
securing the rights of the masses
everywhere? May our govern
ment never fail to lead in the
progress and the uplift of the
people of the world. ,

alight from a moving auto at a

0 jr W. C. T. U. organization
rendered a very interesting pro
gram last night, in our Presby
terian church on the subject of
"Mothers." It was planned un
der a good many subdivisions and
every person having a part ac
quitted himself or herself quite
well, entertaining a large and in- j
teested audience. There is no
telling what home talent can do
until tried. The thing to do is to
harness our home talent, and ev
erything will move: and instruct
if we are inclined to appropriate
a good thing when Ve find it.
May we have more of it!
Many of our people will be gone
tomorrow to celebrate the Fourth
and today notices are posted on
some of our business places:
"Open until 9 o'clock and then
closed for all day," notwithstan-!
ding the fact that we have a
vaudeville in full blast, as well as
other things to furnish entertain-
ment. but I suppose these things
are too tame for some people who
cannot endure quiet enjoyment.
Time makes all things even, and
time will eliminate the love of
excitement from our natures in
due time. ' r
The Mexican trouble does not
seem to abate, but rather is grow
ing, and it seems difficult to prog,
nosticate the coarse, the situation
may adopt . It is hoped, howev
er, that war may be averted and
...;
the cost, in .money and lives,
suffering and anxiety, may not
be realized. Some of our boys,
not hitherto members of bur 0;
N. G.r have volunteered to serve
in whatever may be necessary to
allay the passions of e Mexi
cans for war. Patriotism will al
ways rise' to duty when our coun
try becomes threatened and dan
ger to our people and institutions
of our government are imperilled
Bandit rule must cease from ' our
borders and security to life and
property must be upheld, though
it may cost something to do it!
It is hoped the end ofthe trouble
is near and that we as a people
may enjoy life and its blessings
withoyt molestation or fear!
Tobacco planting is about done.
Hay making and plowing corn
are engaging the attention of the
farmers. " . '
Fourth quarterly meeting will
be held here next Sunday in an
all-day program of religious ex
ercises and taking a social meal
together in the basement of our
M. E. church. It will be a fes
tal day spiritually and physically.
Let every effort be made to make
it an enjoyable occasion.

After the War.
By the fourth of March next,
the war in Europe will doubtless
be at or nearing its end. The
terms of peace which the bellig
erents may secure will have lit
tle or no importance to the Uni
ted States, but the manner in
which the battling nations will
seek to recoup themselves for the
losses of the war will be of tran
scendtnt consecfuence to this
country.
It is evident that the exhaust
ed peoples of Europe cannot re
habilitate themselves from with
in. There is no national osteop
athy which will enable them to
utilize their own internal powers
for their economic recuperation.
They will be compelled to look a
broad for the means of recovery,
they will hav? to seek new and
more extended field3 of trade and
commercial activity, they will
have to turn to other and distant
markets where money has not
been burned in battle and where
natural demands will afford an
outlet for the products of factor
ies and fields which will again be
filled with the men who have
lined the trenches.
The tremendous activities now
being expended upon the battle
field will then be transferred to
industrial pursuits and a flood of
products, feverishly ' fabricated,
w!l!b?poft!redoutir.t the, world;
markets the best of which is to
be found in the United States.
Not only at our own ports, but in
every port of the world, we shall
be confronted with a competition
such as no one has ever seen. To
meet these conditions will re
quire constructive statesmanship
of the highest order and legisla
tion of the most far-seeing char
acter, laritt revision, banking
legislation, shipping laws, and all
kinds of protective ard prophetic
administration will be needed.
For such a task the Democrati".
party is wholly unsuited. Its
parochial and sectional outlook,
its elfish character, its untutored
leadership render it unable to
cope with the problems which
will arise after the war. . To put
will be upon us when the war is
over it will be necessary to re
store the Republican party to
power.

FORGED TO ROB
HEB PATIENT
Strango Experience of a
Trained Nurse.
How ia It that 1 studied to be a train
ed nurse ai;d never took but one case?
I will tell you. A fw days al'twr ic
celving my t!!;i!oma I was at the hos
pital from v:.:di 1 had been graduat
ed. While tlioie u sml:'.e:i -all came
for a nurse. None of the regular nursed
could be spared, but the inquirer was
Informed that a recejit graduate who
had yct to rake lior llrst case was ready
to respond.
I found my patient Kiirrouiiue.l by
every lu::ur;. A cucr.l.ie lady re
ceived me ami told me that her m.ii
was to be ti::r-(d through n ease of fe
ver. Upon gohr,' into the sk-Lrooni 1
saw a man apparently about f(.:ty
whose tnsc h:;d Just been diagnosed as
one of typh itl.
My patient never complained, na mat
ter how he s;ilVere I. at the slight
est approach of relief lie would make
light of his condition. vhic!i 1 knew
well ws:j very serious. I imuie several
mistakes, one (,f whieh was apparent
to the sufferer and resulted :-erious!y
to him. Nevertheless he prcvtutcd the
doctor from knowing that I was the
cause, sending me away when he next
called and explaining his condition in
his own way
But this is not the story. One night
when he was passim; the crisis I step
ped into the hall. It was between 1
and 2 o'clock. I was surprised to find
that the light always kept there was
not burning. While i V is wondering
at this a bright light sfione full in my
face, and a masked man behind it
came toward me. 1 thought only of
my pr.tient, who the doctor had as
sured nie was hovering between life
and death aud could bear no shock.
Two frights cannot occupy the mind at
the same moment. At any rate, 1 step
ped forward to meet him, putting my
finger to my lips.
"There's a man near to death lu thai
room," 1 whispered, pointing. "G.i
downstairs, and I'll help you all 1 can.''
The man motioned for me to go
downstairs before him, then followed
me to the library below. When we
reached it I found the gas burning and,
turning to the man, saw him clutching
a rerolver, which was pointed directly
at me..;vit;.' " ' -;VVv :." '., ..,.
' "Ti'rr over 1U0 p'e.r he' said.' "an'1
1"H gt wui. Jjut '! warn you if yoi ."jtfay
any game -you're a dead woman."
Now, the plate had always been tak
en at night to the. room occupied by my
patient. 1 wouid have discontinued the
practice, but he would not permit, and
It was there now. I told the burglar
that, being a stranger lu the house, 1
could only help him find It and began
a pretended search, when he stopped
me, telling me th.lt the silver Was al
ways tnkeu upstairs, and either I
should go and net it or he would seek
for it in the sickroom.
What could 1 do? I promised to go
and get it for him while he watched
me from tie landing. What a position:
I was obliged to steal the plate, and if
the patient saw me lie might believe
himself In the hands of a thief. Never
theless I went into the room, leaving
the door open, as directed, to bring the
plate. My patient seemed to be in n
doze.1 1 opened the closet door in whic'i
it was kept, keeping my eyes fixed on
the sleeper, if lie was not rather in
coma than asleep. The plate was kepi
in a large morocco covered box. and I
took it (utt and was midway between
the closet and the door when he opened
Ids eyes and looked straight at me
That was the moment of supreme ter
ror of my life.
"What are you doing?" he asked
feebly.
"I need a few articles in this box." 1
said. "I will take them out downstairs
and bring it back."
There must have been a guilty look
on my face rather than a frightened
one, for lie luoked at me with as severe
an expression as his condition would ad
ndt, then, with a groan, turned his face
away. There was nothing for me to do
but to carry the box to the .burglar
lie transferred its contents to a bag h.
carried, then, opening a closet, told mc
to go iitto it. In vain I begged to h
permitted to go back to my patient
assuring the man that without my care
he might die before morning. All in
vain. The brute declared that he would
not trust me lest I give au alarm and
thrust me in the closet.
What I endured there till I heard tb
butler setting the table for breakfast
no" one but myself knows, and I could
never transfer the experience to an
other. When 1 was let out the servant
started back us if he had seen a ghost
There was a mirror in the buffet, and
as I came before it I stood wondering
whose was the reflection hi It with fea
turcs not unlike mine aud hair white
as snow.
I had presence of mind to telephone
for a nurses then told the butler to go
to the patient's room and see if he
were alive. He did so and came back
to say that Ids master wanted me to
come to him. I waited till the nurse
came and sent her In to him to say
that I had been worn out with watch
ing nnd was resting.
When l,saw ray patient again he
was convalescent tie bud ,been pre
pared for everything, but when he saw
my white hair he groaned.
"You have saved my life," ho said,
"and It belongs to you. You must stay
here as long as yon live."
This was all the wooing I got till he
was well, when he made up for the
matter of fact manner of his proposal
and hf-8 bceu making np for It ever
since. .
WENT BACK TO THE RANKS.
Sergeant Johnny Poe Aeked to 'Be Re
duced to a Private.
When Johnny Toe. ex-Princeton foot
ball star, soldier, adventurer and mem
ber of the family to which Edgar Allan
Toe. the poet, belonged, was killed In
1'rance daring the allies' offensive
while serving as a private in the Brit
ish lilack Watch regiment, officers of
the United States marine corps began
to recall incidents in Toe's career with
the American marines.
lu 1'j03. when a war between the
United States and Colombia over the
Panama i-anul strip threatened. Poe.
by authority of the then secretary of
the navy. John D. Long, enlisted with
the "sea soldiers" to serve during the
war. If war s'vadd m-t result he was
to I discharged; for. excellent Boldler
though he was. he could not bear the
"rigors" of a peaceful campaign.
Captain Sr.iedley I). P.utier appointed
Poe a sergeant in ' his machine gun
company, an appointment not at all to
the adventurer's liking. So he went to
Colonel Littleton YV. T. Waller and
asked to bo reduced to private.
"I don't think I'm capable of holding
the rank of seigeant in the United
States marine -or." he told Colonel
Waller.
This was an unusual case, and the
colonel wanted to know why I'oe con
sidered himself not lifted to hold the
rank.
;'I have a fair education aud consid
erable military training." I'oe replied,
"but I haven't been in the marine
corps long enough to be a sergeant and
t; do the duties as well as a marine
sergeant should do tlieni."
Colonel Waller smiled. "Why. Poe."
he said, "a number of second lieuten
ants, only recently commissioned, have
Just joined us. and no one expects
them to know everything there is to
know."
"That's fill rigid, colonel." Poe re
plied quickly. "No one exieet a sec
ond lieutenant to know anything, but
they do expect a whole lot from a ser
geant." Poe was reduced to private and was
put in chaige of the inu'e corral, a Job
more to his liking, since tiiere would be

PRACTICAL HEALTH HINT,
Dropsy. .
Dropsy is not a disease, but a
symptom. Any disorder that
causes the blood to become im
poverished and watery and at
the same time to flow through
the veins with Increased pressure
can cause dropsy. For that rea
son it is ofteu associated with
serious forms of heart or kidney
disease. When dropsy is the re
sult of Bright's disease it Is be
cause the kidneys are no longer
able to extract water and poison
ous matters from the blood.
Dropsy that arises from heart &
troubles is worse at night and
arter exertion, exactly tue con
trary is true of the dropsy caus
ed by kidney trouble, which Is
more marked in the morning.
Sometimes the patient suffers
from both heart and kidney trou
ble, in which case his condition
Is very grave, and the dropsy
may become excessive. ' Many
persons who suffer from general
weakness, but have no actual
disease, find that their feet and
legs swell toward night, but that
symptom disappears as the de
bility imsses away. Such cases
should be treated with tonics
and rest and plenty of fresh air.
