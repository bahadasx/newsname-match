AN ENVIABLE
REPUTATION

NORTH DA-
kota as a state
has the reputa­
tion of being the
Bread Basket of
the World. With
this notority also
comes undesira­
ble beings who
are looking for
money and valu­
ables it
working for them,
PROTECT your
property and
business by burn­
ing a NIGHT
LIGHT. Dark­
ness invites crime
but light dispoils
the thought of
theft. You can
burn a 40 watt
Mazda lamp for
25 hours for the
price of a kilo­
watt, or about 1-2
cent per hour.
Can you afford
to run the risk in
having your
place of business
without this pro-
tection? Call
your local man­
ager for estimate
if you have not
already the prop­
er instillation.

MERRIT KIMBALL KILLED
Steele County Boy Loses Life
on Battlefield in France
The sad news was received
here last week that Men-it Kim
ball, son of Porter Kimball, of
Riverside Township, was among
is in S or a
another letter was received stat
ing that he was killed in action
on June 7th.
Men-it was horn on the old
Kimball homestead in Riverside
twenty-seven years ago. While
a boy he accompanied the family
to Fargo and there graduated
from Fargo High .School. Dur
ing his high school days he was
prominent in athletics and was
one
of
the football stars of his
class.
After completing his educa
tion he accompanied his broth
ers to Canada where they were
engaged in the contracting busi
ness and was associated with
them when war was declared.
He was among the first to volun
teer and was in the ambulance
service in France until about the
first of this year. At this time
he was offered a commission as
a Lieutenant which he accepted
and in the course of his duty
was sent with his regiment to
the front. No details have been
received as to how or where he
met death owing to the strict
censorship of all letters. The
report of his death was sent by
a friend to Ed Kimball at Cal
gary.
Taking Big Chances
It is a great risk to travel
without a bottle of Chamber
lain's Colic, Cholera and Diar
rhoea Remedy as this prepara
tion cannot be obtained on the
trains or steamships. Attacks
of bowel complaint are often
sudden and very severe, and ev
eryone should go prepared for
them. Obtainable everywhere.

Business
Farmer
The Dort was built for the business
farmer. For 30 years Dort had been
building farm vehicles. He knew what
the farmer wanted for vehicles and
what he needed in an automobile.
Tf an automobile is going to be a business
asset to the farmer he must be able to
use it every day in the year when the
roads are deep with snow when the tem
perature is far below zero and again in
the spring wlien lhe frost ia corning out of the ground
and the lmid is so doep and thick that the average
car will sink to the hubs und be hopelessly mired.
The Dort is built for these conditions. It is a real
(armor's automobile. The price, $665, puts it with
in tin.' rcrtoh of every business farmer. Its light
weiylit injures low cost of operation.
From every standpoint of mechanical excellence
and appearance tiie Dort merits a careful inveati
Ration of the Business Farmer.
