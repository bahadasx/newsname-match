Tne ei.Lirt? second position of the
Germans south of the Soinme, over an
extent of approximately six miles, haa
fallen into the hands of the French,
who have also captured the village of
Hem, near the north extremity of their
line, and have completed their con
quest of Estrees.
The British line has apparently fail
ed to advance, except "slightly in cer
tain sectors," as the Eritish war office
puts it. None of the ground gained
by the British has been lost, however,
ad the further statement of the Brit
ish that the fighting all along the bat
tle fVont was mostly in the nature of
local struggles for the possession of
strong: points would seem to indicate
that each side is devoting particular
attention to the organization of its
positions and the strengthening of its
hand for further attack or defense.
16,000 Germans Prisoners.
The number of German prisoners
reported by the British and French
ha sreached about 16,000 while the
German casualties have been unof
ficially estimated at 60,000. On their
part, the Germans report the taking- of
b considerable number of British sol
diers. Comparative quiet for the time be
ing has settled over Verdun, although
tN? bombardments, of necessity, con
t me. But while the respite is on at
Verdun, the Germans have opened x
new attack on fie French lines near
the Lorraine frontier, some miles to
the. east of Luneville. They delivered
st rone assaults against the French
trenches in this sector and entered
the mat three points, only to be driven
out shortly afterwards.

NOMINEE HUGHES SPENDS
BUSY DAY IN NEW YORK.
Approves Liberal Representation of
Progressives on Campaign Committee.
New York, July 5. Charles E.
Hughes, hero on a two days' trip from
his summer home at Eridgehampton,
today approved the proposal of his ad
visors to have a liberal representation
of the progressive party on his cam
paign committee. This committee vir
tually will have entire charge of the
campaign. The tentative programme
calls for a committee of seventeen, of
whom ten will be members of the ex
ecutive committee of the republican
national committee. Of the remaining
seven, probably five will be progressive
leaders. The personnel of both the
executive committee and the campaign
committee probably will be announced
within the next few days, as well as
the selection of a treasurer and a sec
retary of the national committee.
In a long conference with Chairman
William R. Vv'illcox, jrr. Hughes also
outlined his propr.sod programme pro
viding for the opening of the campaign
with a five week trip to the Pacific
coast, beginning early in August. -Mr.
Wlllcox and other party leaders en
dowsed the idea, and it is likely that it
will be definitely adopted.
The nominee spent a busy day in
conference with many callers. " He
fiuso had another long talk tonight
with Mr. "vv'illcox. Mr. Hushes expects
to return tomorrow afternoon to
Bridgehampton.
ELDERLP WOMAN TRIED TO
DROWN HERSELF AT NOANK
Mrs. Lydia Patterson, 70, Threw Her
self Into a Cistern.
Noank. Conn.. July 5. Mrs. Lydia
Patterson, 70 years old attempted to
rlrown herself in the cistern at her
home here on Tuesday. She was
rescued by her niece, Mrs. Charles Cox
3f Providence, who was visiting here
nd several neighbors summoned by
Mrs. Cox's cries. Sudden mental un
balance is given as cause of her deed,
is she has had loving care by rela
tives and was in general good health.
Airs. Cox coming in from a shopping
trip heard a splash In the cellar and
saw no signs of her aged aunt. She
hurried down stairs and found Mrs.
Patterson had crawied into the 18 inch
space between cistern top and the
fioor and thrown herself in the water.
Mrs. Cox climbed in, too, and suc
eeded in holding her aunt's head
ibove water for the hour it required
neighbors to think of and execute a
plan for her removal. She was final
ly slide out on a door brought by two

MEW SWISS LOAN
IS OVER SUBSCRIBED.
Matronal Debt Has Multiplied Six
Times as Result of War.
Berne, Switzerland, July 5, via Paris,
1.00 p. m. The new Swiss loan of
(00,OW,C00 franca at 5 1-2 per cent.
?sued at 97, haa been ovr-subscrib-.d
by 61,000,000 francs. Since the be-
finnlns ot the war, the Swiss national
lebt has vlseo. jmiti an average or zs
reported by the Russians, who claim to
have cut the railroad running from
Lemberg'. the capital of Galieia, to
Delatyn. This is the main line of
communication for the Austro-Ger-mans
defending Lemberg and allied
military critics have insisted that the
cutting of this railroad would compel
the central power forces to fall back
on a wide front and place Lemberg in
imminent peril.
The Russian war office, in a late
communication, also claims the rout
of the enemy forces on the right bank
o ft.he Dniester.
The views expressed in Berlin re
specting the Anglo-French offensive
reflect confidence on the part of the
Germars that the German line will
hold and that German control of the
territory now occupied in France and
Belgium will remain steadfast. The
successes so far attained by the
French and British are looked upon as
of minor importance.
Rumania Again Figures.
Rumania has again come into the
light and talk has been revived of the
possible entrane into the European
war of that country. Despatches tell
of the recent decision of the two
strong opposing factions in the Ru
manian political arena to act togeth
er hereafter. Their attitude is said
to be in favor of intervention on the
side of the entente allies.
Constantinople officially reports that
the Russians have been driven out of
Kermanshah, in western Persia, while
the Russians claim to have broken
the Turkish line east of Baiburt.
The number of Russian prisoners
captured south of the Fnpet river in
the month of June, according to the
Berlin statement, reached more than
23,00:i men.
GOV. HOLCOMB SPENDS
NIGHT AT NIANT1C
Company M, First Regiment, is Now
in Camp There.
Camp Holeomb, Niantic, Conn., July
5. Governor Holeomb arrived in camp
early this evening to spend the mgm
here. This is the governor's second
visit to this concentration base since
the militiamen were called out for ser
vice in connection with the Mexican
border. On a recent visit Governor
Holeomb promised that he would make
a later visit to the camp and spend the
night, and his coming tonight was in
fulfillment of that promise.
On the same train which brought
the governor came Company M of Win
sted, First Connecticut infantry, under
command of Capt. Amos Beecher.
This company was left behind when
the other infantry commands were
sent to the border because some of
the men while quartered in the armory
at Winsted had been exposed to pos
sible infection of measles. Later they
were quartered in a temporary camp
on the Oolebrook road just outside of
Winsted. They left there last Mon
day under orders to hike to this camp.
When they reached Farmington, 'how
ever, a change in the orders was made
and they were directed to proceed to
Hartford and there entrain for Camp
Holeomb. They were met at the Xi
antic station by the First regimer.t
band and escorted to camp.
On their arrival here they pitched
their tents and were eoon settled in
their new quarters.
SETTLEMENT OF THE IRISH
QUESTION IS IN SIGHT
On Such Assurance Walter- Hugh
Long Has Withdrawn His Resigna
tion. London, July 5, 7.20 p. m. The out
look for a complete settlement of the
Irish question has improved. It was
announced today that Walter Hugh
Long, president of the local govern
ment board, had received assurances
to this effect, of such a nature as to
justify him in withdrawing his resig
nation. A meeting of Unionists to consider
the matter will be held at the Carlton
club on Friday.
The Earl of Belborne resigned the
presidency of the board of agriculture
on account of the Irish question and
it was reported that Mr. Long: and the
Marquis of Lansdowne, minister with
out portfolio, had presented their res
ignations. The foregoing, however, is
the first definite information that Mr.
Long gave in his resignation, which
he has not withdrawn.

BLOODY BATTLE BETWEEN
DE FACTO AND VILLA TROOPS
General Ignacio Ramos Was Killed in
Trench Heavy Losses,
Chihuahua. Mex.. Julv 4, via El Paso.
July 5. General Ignacio Romas was
killed in a fierce and bloody battle that
raged ail yesterday between a small
force of de facto troops and a large
band of Villa followers at Corral ranch,
15 males southwest of Jiminez. Both
sides suffered heavy losses.
Rather than retire to Jiminez with
out carrying out his orders, which
were not to return unless he was able
to report success, General Ramos
fought in his entrenchments until
killed, cheering his men on to the last.
The Carranza troops were surround
ed Monday at daybreak and for more
than 12 'hours held their position
against heavy odds in the hops that
reinforcements soon would arrive.
At nightfall, after their leader had
been killed and the greater part of '.he
command killed or wounded, the sur
vivors retired to Jiminez with their
wounded.
Three times during the day the Villa
men dashed through heavy fire to the
edge of the Carranza trenches, but
were unable to tike them.
Reinforcements which had been or
dered to join General Ramos at Corral
were delayed by a wreck near Ortis
and the pioposed general offensive
arainst the Villa forces did not mate
rialize. After the Corral clash, the garrison
at Santa Rosalia was rushed south to
guard Jiminez against any attack. In
the meantime 2,000 troops, including
the famous brigade of Domingo Ar
reta, were sent south to attack the
forces which cut off General Ramos'
command. General Maclovio Garcia,
who is in charge of this campaign, is
keeping in cloce communication with
General Trevir.o.

exican Note
Wafts War Cloud
REMARKABLE FOR ITS BREVITY
AND FRIENDLY TONE
CRISIS IS DISSIPATED
Fact That Secretary Lansing Is to
Start on Vacation Friday is Basis for
Belief That the Crisis is -Over.
Washington, July 5. Early resump
tion of friendly diplomatic conversa
tions with the de facto government of
Mexico to the end that peace and
order may be restored in Northern
Mexico and along the border is ex
pected here to be the next step of the
United States in its relations with its
southern neighbor.
Crisis Dissipated.
The crisis precipitated by Villa's
raid on Columbus, N. M.. and culmin
ating in the fight at Carrizal, Mexico,
between American and Mexican
troops, appeared tonight to have been
dissipated by an amicable note from
General Carranza presented during the
day by his ambassador-designate here.
.ciiseo Arreaonao.
The note proposes that the differ
ences between the governments be
settled by mediation or by direct ne
gotiations. Brief and Friendly.
It is remarkable for its brevity, its
restraint and Iriendly tone, and for
the absolute lack of any of the strong,
even insolent language which char
acterized the last two communications
from the do facto government. It
treats as a closed incident the ex
change of unfriendly communications
which brought war almost within
sight.
No Comment From State Department.
No formal comment on the note was
obtainable from the state department
officials. A copy was forwarded ta
the Whitt House immediately upon its
receipt and President Wilson will de
termine the course to be pursued. The
f;ct that Secretary Lansing complet
ed his preparations today for a
month's vacation to begin Friday is
regarded as significent, however, of
a feeling on his part that he crisis
is over.
State Department Officials Satisfied.
State department officials appeared
entirely satisfied with the definition of
the mait.crs to be settled outlined in
the new Mexican note. It is presented
in this language as translated at the
embassy:
"The American f -"-ernment believes
reasonably that ti.e insecurity of its
frontier is a source of difficulty; and
the Mexican government on its part
believes that, the stay of American
troops 011 Mexican territory. aside
from being a trespass on the
sovereignty of Mexico, is the immedi
ate cause of the conflicts. Therefore
tiie withdrawal of American troops, on
the one hand and the protection of the
Ironrier on the other, are the two es
sential problems, the solution of which
must be the directing object of the
ef.orts of both governments."
The Impelling Influence.
Officials believe that the call for the
national guard and the actual dis
patch of the troops to the border was
the impelling influence which induced
General Carranza to abandon the hos
tile attitude taken in his previous
notes. They say the United States
holds a strong argument in favor of
peaceful i-olution of border difficulties
so long as it maintains an army near
the line and there seems little proba
bility that it will be withdrawn until
all danger har passed.
Unquestionably if no new ba.ndit
Outbreaks occur, the national guards
men will be gradually sent back to
t'nir homes. It originally was plan
ned that oniy a part of the force be
used on the bolder, the remainder sen
later to relieve regiments which had
put in the required time at active ser
vice. That scheme may be followed
later.
REPRISAL MEASURES DISCUSSED
IN THE HOUSE OF LORDS
For
Short Rations Given to
Prisoners in Germany.
British
London, July 5, 6.06 p. m. The po
sitio nof British prisoners in the camp
at Ruhleben, Germany, whose' rations
are said to have been reduced, was
raised in the house of lords today by
Baron ravenport. Lord Beresford and
other members opposed the idea of in
stituting reprisals on the ground t'nat
it would not influence the Germans,
who, they said, would be prlad of any
excuse to starve British prisoners.
Baron Newton, under-seeretary for
foreign affairs, announced that the
foreign office had at last received the
reply of Germany to the proposals
made by the British government. The
reply has not yet been examined, bat
it is not a categorical refusal. Baron
Newton therefore asked that the dis
cussion be adjourned.

Favorable Report
nue Bill
MADE BY THE HOUSE WAYS AND
MEANS COMMITTEE
TO RAISE $200,000,000
Increased Surtax On Incomes and
From Taxes on Inheritances and War
Munitions Profits.
Washington, July 5. The adminis
tration general revenue bill, designed
to produce about $200,000,000 of addi
tional revenue from inchreased surtax
on incomes and from taxes on inherit
ances and war munitions profits, was
favorably reported today by the house
ways and means committee and prob
ably will be passed by the 'house Mon
day. Two Republicans Vote with Democrats
crats.
Two republican members of the
committee, Longworth of Ohio and
Gardner of Massachusetts, voted with
the democrats for a favorable report,
but reserved the right to express dur
ing debate in the house their objec
tions to the methods of the majority in
framing the measure. Two other re
publican committeemen, Green of Iowa
and Sloan of Nebraska, while they
voted against reporting the bill, gave
notice that they expected to support it
on the final roll call.
General Debate Eegins Today.
General debate is expected to begin
Thursday under a special rule provid
ing for a final vote before adjournment
Monday. That plan was definitely
agreed on during the day by house
leaders.
The committee report says that the
necessity for revenue legislation "grows
out of the extraordinary increase in
the approprh.tions for the army and
navv and fortifications of our coun
try." The fiscal situation is summarized in
this way:
"Estimated excess of disbursements
over receipts for the lineal year ending
June 30, 1317. $266,922,000; aoditional
receipts under the proposed bill, in
come tax, 5107,000.000, and estate tax,
$17,000,000 (and it is estimated that the
annual receipts from the estate ta.x
will amount to $54,000,000 when the law
is in full operation): munition manu
facturers' tax, $71,000,000; miscellane
ous taxes, $2,000,000; total additional
receipts, $l!?7, 000,000; balance to bo
taken from general fund, $63,922,000.
Ealance in General Fund.
"Fortunately the balance in the gen
eral fund June 'JO, 19 IB, was much
larger than at the end of any fiscal
year since Hips. After deducting $59,
000,000 for disbursing officers' balances,
thcrce remained in trnis fund over
$177,000,000. After deducting $69,922,
000 from this fund, as above, there will
still remain June 30, 1:j 17, in the gen
eral fund over $100,000, "00 exclusive of
the disbursing officers' balances. It is
estimated that the total appropriation
for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1917,
will not exceed $1, 570,000.000. This
Includes $125,000,000 to meet the extra
ordinary expense or disbursements oc
casioned by the Mexican situation. This
and any other appropriations that may
be necessary to meet the abnormal and
extraordinary expenses which may be
incurred 011 such account should be
financed by bond issues, as is always
done by this and all other nations un
der similar circumstances."
BRIDGEPORT WOMAN SHOT
DURING FIREWORKS DISPLAY
Was in a Dense Crowd It Was First
Supposed She Died of Heart Disease
Bridg-eport, Conn., July 5. A 32 cal
ibre bullet was found today in the
heart of Mrs. Mary Summers, 50 years
old, of Newark, X. J., who dropped
dead last night during a pyrotechnic
display at Seaside Park, this city. At
the time it was thought that fright
and heart disease had killed her. .
Mrs. Summers was in a dense crowd
at the edge of the park about S.30 o'
clock last night when a young man
fired a revolver close by her. She
threw up her arms, screamed and
dropped unconscious. She was dead
when an ambulance arrived. The
body was taken to the morgue and the
acting medical examiner was noti
fied. After a cursory examination he
gave the opinion that it was heart
disease iind fright that caused her end
In preparing the body for burial to
day, however, a wound was found over
the heart and further examination
showed the presence of the bullet.
No trace of the person using the
revolver has been found. It was sup
posed last night that the weapon was
loaded with blank cartridges and al
though the police had been busy all
day arresting users of this form of
celebration, the man slipped quietly
away in the crowd and according to
the police no description of him was
obtained.
