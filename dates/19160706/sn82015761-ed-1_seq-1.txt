HALF MILLION ACRES
OPENED TO ENTRY
Phoenix, Ariz., June "29. Two
divisions of the -Dixie National
forest lying north of the Grand
Canyon in Mohave and Coconino
counties, and amounting to 506
880 acres, have been restored to
entry by order of President Wilson
according to an executive order re
ceived at the local land office.
The order practically wipes out
the two weoteru portiors of the
Dixie National forest. The land
will be thrown open to entiy for
settlement July 12 at 9 a. m., and
for filing on thiity days later. It
is expected that the state land de
partment will file selections on a
large portion of the land thus made
available for selection.
EARLY MARRIAGES
The "mariagable age"- in most
European countries is surprisingly
low. if compared with that in the
British' I? les. '
Germany, Russia and France
are all fairly sensible. In Ger
many the man must be 18 before
he can legally marry, 4 while in
France and Russia, it is the same
with a minimum of 16 for the girl
. But other countries are far less
strict even than this. - -
In Greece the. man must have
seen at least fourteen summers, and
the woman if "woman" she can
'be called twelve.
it is the same in l ortugai, in
Spain', in Switzerland and in Hun
gary (for Roman Catholics)'
All these countries commonly
witness marriages in which little
. girls of a dozen years are led to
the alter. Protestants in Hungary
are stricter than Koinan catholics,
the age minimum being; 18 for a
uiAii and 15 for a 'woman".
As or Turkey, there is no irar-
rlage minimum- age there at all!
Any tiny tots who can toddle to
church and get through the neces
sary cremeny are allowed to oe
united for life.
Thus, it is possible to be a widow
or a widower in Cooatantinople at
jhe premature age of four or five!

CELEBRATION NOTES
The Williams automobile parade
into Flagstaff the Fourth was met
by the Flag band and escorted thru
the town. ' The parade was a fine
one consisting of about 20 autos'.
The Studebaker automobile which
Flag people raffled off the Fourth
was won by L. S. Williams of our
Bill town. He invested in one
$1 00 ticket and. had about one
chance 5n: 2,000. '
The fast time on the track at
Flag., was made by. Smith of
Williams. Until his wheel went
flat he was covering the ground
at the rate of 43 seconds per half
mile lap. After the puncture
he was hard to catch and it took
13 laps for the winner to pass
hira.
It may be a coincidence vbut
they do say that the only cars
in the Flagstaff auto race which
escaped tire trouble had Fire
Stone tires.
And isn't it to smile? The
winners of the auto race at
Flag., the Fourth were little old
Fords. Henry is not supposed
just the same.
Except for a little hard luck
Williams would have won the auio
race at: Flag : the Fourth. The
Smith: . car was in the lead and
proved that it could be held when
a puncture was experienced in
the fourth lap.- After the puncture
lead "was heldfor 13 laps. The
handicap imposed by the acci
dent - was . too great, however.
Conditions rgrew worse and the
race ' had to be abandoned.
c The winners of the Auto races
at Flag.; the Fourth were Wal
house of Flag ,- who drove' No;: .!
and Mack, also of Flag., who
drove No. 5. . No. 1 made the
distance at the rate of 44 seconds
per. half mile lap and No, .5 made
the distance at the rate of 45
seconds per half mile lap.
, It was a generous Fourth of
July crowd at Flag., Tuesday,
About $300 was raised ' for
Peaches, the driver of No. 4
which met with the accident in
the auto race. It was realized
that he would have won the race
except tor the accident, it was
also felt that his quick action to
avoid killing another by risking
his own life to make it, should
have recognition.
Risks Own Life To Save Another
A' -Very serious accident was
barely avtrte'd on the race track
at Flagstaff the Fourth. When
Peaches of Flag, who drove No.
4 had "nearly completed the race,
well in the lead, he was obliged
to turn from the track quickly to
avoid running into a man who
was crossing the tack. The
short turn tipped the car over,
but-Peaches fortunately was able
to jump clear of the car and was
not seriously injured. Had he
not made the quick turn he
would, probably have caused a
death.
