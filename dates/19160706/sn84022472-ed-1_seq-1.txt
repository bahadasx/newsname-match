save his detachment, -it was learned
itoday. .The Incident occurred shortly

"The isoldiers a detachment of the

la search of bandits believed to have
. bad their rendezvous in a zne mine
- about 10 miles from the American
. laeer- -Not finding any 'bandits they
jtsrted-back jmd had turned into, the
snaln road; the -entrance to a canyon,
Srhen three Mexiaans, balf a mile to
he south," opened fire. Immediately
khe troopers replied and the Mexicans
' disappeared over the top of a ridge. -Ueut.
Hlckam did not follow, real
ising that the- terrain ta that dlrec-
lon formed a natural trap and that
.the territory to the south was not un-
. der patrol. " J;' . ;
- The Americans turned north, . trot
ting into the canyon. As they wont
down the hHl a, trooper galloped up
from the rear, reporting that about
' coo armed, mounted Mexicans had
dashed 'over the ridge where the three
. Mexicans fired.
I Lieut. Hlckam started for a hill up
the canyon, to make a stand If too
. bard pressed. " v:
"When the, Carranza forces seemed
'about, to x overtake - his men, Lieut.
Hlckam 'led them oft the road Into a
walled . depression ' about , 10 feet
deep where a huge oak shut : them
from . view '.Within 100. yards ' tho
Mexicans rode past without . discov
ering the hidden Americans.' .Then
.the latter, at a .leisurely, pace, follow
,cd 'their late pursuers until the. hill
'was reached. -Here they Brew up
along the crest of the .canyon with
deep ravines protecting each; flank.
At this point they had a 'chance,, in
-case of attack, to ' get their horses
safely up and over the mountain ridge
.overlooking the canyon which ran
upward from the American rear. . But
When the Carranza troops came back
. down the canyon road they passed
i he foot of the hill without a hostile
move of any sort against the Ameri
cans,' whom they could see) plainly a
, few hundred yards above. , .
The cavalrymen believe that word
- . of their proximity had been taken to
the: Carranza forces . by the Mexican
. caretaker of . the mine, who . was
' equipped with ' ah excellent pair of
field glasses. - He said that he had
. been accustomed to retire to the bot
tom of (he mine uporf the, approach
of any. strangers, whether,- .bandits;

explained that he had' not hlddeif in

! j Washington; July' 6 Another enV

in Santo Domingo and American -marines
in which 27 Dominicans were
killed and five captured, and one ma
Tine killed and eight ' wounded, was
reported to the navy department to
day by Rear. Admiral Caperton. The
fight occurred July 1 before the tenta
tive agreement was made for the dis
armament of the rebels.
The American killed was Corporal
George' Fravee. Only one of the
founded marine was injured seriously.
The revolutionists were routed, Ad
miral Caperton reported, carrying off
a number of wounfted during their re
treat. -
The engagement which evidently
immediately preceded the peace nego
tiations in - which Admiral Caperton
yesterday informed the department the
revolutionists had agreed to disarm,
occurred in the interior at Guayacanes.
The revolutionists were strongly en
trenched and concealed in a position
which prevented advance artillery fire.
The enemy outpost opened the firing,
Admiral Caperton stated.
The light reported today was the
fourth between United States marines
and revolutionists in about a week.
Officials believe that the complete rout
of the revolutionists in die last en
