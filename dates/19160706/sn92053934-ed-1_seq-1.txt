Remains of Nine United

Home for Burial.
FIND EIGHT TOGETHER
All but One Exhumed From
Crude Grave Greeted
by Silent Throng.
Fl Pao, Jnly fi. The bodies of
Captain diaries T. Boyd, Lieuten
ant 1 1 t il r Adair and seven troop
ers i l lie Tenth cavalry, killed at
I arrival, were brought to Kl Paso
today at s::;u a. m. Only the bod
ie of the two officers and Private
Be Mitt Rucker have been identi
lied. Eight of the Americans were ex
humed from a single grave, the under
takers who brought back the bodies,
said.
The dead had been gathered from
the field of battle and cast into a ditch.
This was then filled up.
Captain Boyd. Ueutenant Adair and
six troopers, stripped of their uniforms,
were mixed indiscriminately in the
dirt.
The holy of the ninth trooper was
located two miles distant from the oth
ers. He had been wounded and appar
ently had dragged himself away to die
in the gravelly wast, beyond the town.
Greeted by Silent Crowd.
Scenes in sharp contrast to those of
a week ago, when the Carrizal pris
oners were brought from Chihuahua
City and turned over to General George
Bell, Jr., marked the return of the
Lmeriean dead. In Juarez the event
vras scarcely noticed, while in "Kl Paso
ny a few hundred persons, quiet and
tnbdued, replaced the cheering throng
that greeted the 23 troopers of the
Tenth.
Arrival I nexperted.
General Bell had not expected the
bodies to be delivered so early in the
morning and the Eighth cavalry,
which had been detailed from Fort
Bliss to act as an escort was not on
hand. An impromptu guard was form
ed however from soldiers of the Sev
enth infantry encamped near the
bridge. Part of these marched beside
the car while the remainder stood at
attention as it rolled off the bridge up
on American soil.
Word was immediately sent to Fort
Bliss and the Eighth cavalry was
started cityward.
Only one of the troopers bodies had
been identified early today, that of De
Witt Rucker, K troop. Tenth cavalry.
None of the others bore identification
taps.
Indifference in Juarez to the event
was explainable in the fact that the
train did not arrive there from Villa
Ahurnada until late last night.

THE WAR TODAY
After capturing second line Ger

front sooth of the Somme in
northern France and making nota
ble advances north of that stream,
the French last night, temporarily
halted the offensive operations of
their infantry.
Hard fighting continued along
the line of the British attack and a

On the other bank of the river
the French are striking east of the
Tillage of Hem which they cap

The British line has not changed
except in a few places
None of the ground gained by
the British ha been lost however.
The British and French have tak

the German casualties are unof
ficially estimated at fiOWO in the
battle of the Somme. The Germans
report the captnre of a "considera
ble number" of British soldiers.
Around Verdun there is compar

have launched another attack
against the French near the Lor

VVILOUN WILL
FRAME REPLY
TO CARRANZA
Acceptance of Proposal for
Ending Differences to Be
Sent Soon.
j WITH D RAWAL DOU BTED
Immediate Bringing Out of
Troops Not Regarded
Acceptable Basis.
Washington, Jnly 6. Formal
acceptance of General Carranza's
proposal that differences between
the lnited States and the de facto
government of Mexico be settled
by direct negotiations, will be dis
patched soon to 31exico City. This
was decided by President Wilson
today at a conference with Secre
tary Lansing.
Secretary Lansing will leave tomor
row for a month's vacation. It was
not stated today whether he would pre
pare the reply before his departure.
He will be in direct touch with the
White house and state department dur
ing his absence, but informal conver
sations with Eliseo Arredondo, Mexi
can ambassador designate will be con
ducted by Counsellor Polk, acting as
secretary.
While Carranza's amicable note has
greatly eased tension no official was
willing today to predict the final out
come of the negotiations which are
foreshadowed. It was made plain,
however, that immediate withdrawal
of General Pershing's expeditionary
forces from Mexico will not be an ac
t a-hlA basis-for .whatever plan- of
cooperative action along the border -is
worked out.
Washington officials take the posi
tion that demonstration of Carranza's
ability to carry out the promises ex
pressed and implied in his note is
still lacking. President Wilson, it is
pointed out, has been ready to with
draw the American troops at any time
tlw de facto government would show
the ability to furnish adequate mili
tary protection for the border.
Efficiency of Mexican police meas
ures may be put soon to a severe test,
according to rumors transmitted to the
state department. These, state that
Francisco Villa has recovered from his
wounds and is personally leading a
force northward from the region just
south of Parral.
GULF STATES ARE
STRUCK BY STORM
New Orleans, La.. Julv 6. The cen
ter of the tropical hurricane appar
ently struck Mobile, Ala., and Pensa
cola, Fla., and the section between
those points yesterday and last night,
according to local we-ather bureau of
ficials today. The storm moved inland
in a northwesterly direction from the
Gulf of Mexico at an estimated ve
locity of about 80 miles on hour.
Extent of the damage could not be
learned early today, as Mobile, Pen
sacola and other points on the lower
Mississippi, Alabama and west Flor
ida coasts were still cut off from all
communication. Even wireless plants
here working throughout the night
and early today failed to get any re
sponse from Mobile or Pensacola sta
tions. TO PRESS SHIPPING
MEASURE TO A VOTE
Washington, July 6. The govern
ment shipping bill probably will be
pressed o a vote in the senate at this
session even if it is necessary to keep
congress here all summer.
This was evident today from last
night's caucus of senate democrats. A
majority of them insisted that action
be taken on the bill despite strong
hints from the republicans that any
move to that end would meet with de
termined opposition. The latter had
proposed that if action be postponed
until the next session they would
agree to fix a date for the vote.
Final decision of the democrats,
however was deferred until tomorrow
night, when they caucus aagin.
SEE PEACE COMING
TO SANTO DOMINGO
Washington, July 6. Peace may
soon be restored in Santo Domingo.
This apepared to be a strong possi
bility today as a result of the action
of Dominican revolutionists in agree
ing to lay down their arms, pending
further negotiations looking to the es
tablishment of a new government, with
American supervision over the repub
lic's affairs.
The agreement was announced in a
dispatch received late yesterday from
Rear Admiral Caperton in command I
of the American forces in Santo Do-I
die go.

El Paso, Texas, July 6. Villistas,
pursuing their victory over Carranzis
tas at Corral ranch July 4, have at

Reports tr&m Chihuahua City fol
lowing the engagement at Corral said
the broken Carranzista command has
been reinforced at Jiminez by 2,000
men under General Domingo Arriet.
The Villista forces are said to number
3,000.
Another report was that FYancisco
Villa recently sent a communication to
Canuto Reyes, his former lieutenant,
who was recently amnestied by the de
facto government asking him to recon
sider his decision. This message Reyes
turned over to General Jacinto Tre
vino, Carranzista commander of the
army of the north, it was said. The
American who brought the report as
serted that Villa was then at San Juan
Bautispo, about thirty miles south of
Parral and had with him one thousand
men.

gave out the following report:
"One of our submarines sank an en

Tuesday.
"The submarine U-35, which carried
to Cartagena, Spain, an autograph let

lowing: "One of our mine sweepers in the
North sea was hit by a torpedo from an
enemy submarine on Tuesday. It was
slightly damaged and is now in har

for submarines.
Sinking of the French rteainship
Herault in the Mediterranean by a sub

increased in Germany as never before
during times of peace. Statistics from
big cities and industrial regions alone
indicate an increase of 288.000 ac

counts. The excess of deposits over
withdrawals is 2.500.000,000 marks. In
crease in the capital of savings banks
is 3,250,000.000 marks.
To supply much fibrious materials,
55.000 acres in Germany this year have

two automobile accidents near here
late yesterday. Five were injured
wheni, automobiles driven by George
Mulligan of Clinton and Henry
Schoenig of Bryant met head-on about

four occupants of the other car, 37
stitches being necessary to close cuts
in Mr. Mulligan's arms, while Joseph
Ryan suffered a scalp wound and
Frank Baker scalp wounds, a sprained
ankle and strained hip. Charles Taylor
the other member of the party, leaped
from the car in time and escaped in
jury. Three others. Dr. and Mrs. G. O.
Runkel and daughter Dorothy, of
Stockton, HI., were injured on the Illi

Suhsea Case
Is Taking on
Better Tone
Berlin, July 5, 5 p. m., (via London,
July 6, 8:20 a. m.) The campaign
for resumption of a full fledged sub
marine war on commerce goes ener
getically forward. It was expected
that when the reichstag adjourned this
agitation by the Navy league, publi
cists, conservatives and part of the na
tional liberals would gradually lose its
intensity.
On the contrary, never a day passes
without articles in various newspapers
throughout Germany to remind the
people that, according to the German
note, modification of German submar
ine methods merely was temporary
and contingent upon a modification of
the British blockade.
Advocates of the "unrestricted tor
pedo" appear at almost every polit
ical gathering. Various newspapers
have almost daily a rubric for what
they call "British postal robbers" and
ever and again attention is called to
the fact that the blockade has not un
dergone the slightest modification.
The purpose of the agitation is two
fold. One branch of it is directed to
ward the resumption of the submar
ine campaign which is felt to be the
or.Iy effective naval weapon against
Great Britain. The other now has
developed openly and avowedly into a
movement against the chancellor, Dr.
von Bethmann-Hollweg, largely on
the ground of internal politics.
Some judges of the situation are In
clined to believe the movement will
lead, not later than September, to a
revival of the submarine campaign on
the old lines. Recent inquiries by The
Associated Press in authoritative quar
ters indicate, however, that the gov
ernment for the present, has no in
tention of resuming the "freedom of
action" mentioned in the May note and
of provoking conflict with the United
States.
One reason for this decision, which
tends to become stronger, is the de
tends to become stronger, is desire to
avoid any new measures tending to pro
long the war. Another is based on
the conviction that the faith of the
present administration now is so close
ly bound up witli the submarine issue
that a reversal of policy would entail
opposition from wide, influential
groups of political leaders and power
ful personages in the administration.
The situation in this respect has
changed sharply since winter. It
then seemed as if the chancellor's pol
icy of moderation had scarcely a
friend in Germany outside of the so
cialists and part of .he progressive
party, but since then the issue has
been sharply drawn and a full realiza
tion has come that one purpose of the
agitation was to down the chancellor.
The influential Catholic center party
has enrolled itself almost solidly in his
suport, the south German states hava
lined up firmly behind him and those
sections of pulilic opinion which have
reason to fear conservative domina
tion of the administration have made
their choice between submarines and
junkers and have joined the chancel
lor's party. The old impatience of
navy olficers for action has become a
less prominent factor in the movement.
All in all. the clouds over German
American relations now are less low
ering than for a long lime.

COUNTERATTACKS FAIL
Weak Rebuffs of Kaiser's
Men Subdued by Enemy

London, July 6 (12:35 p. m.)
Having captured the whole Ger
man second line south of the
Somme from the river to Belloy,
the French have resumed opera
tions north of the river and have
cleared the bank almost to Clery.
The French, who have establish
ed themselves at Sormont farm,
also threaten Clery.
The British are still heavily en
paged along1 their front from liar
doconrt to Gomniccourt. Notwith
standing heavy German counter
attacks they have been able to
maintain all ground gained and
extend it at some points.
Evidence accumulates of the
deadly execution of artillery. In
.some cases N) per cent of the de
fenders were killed. British losses
vary. Certain formations, called
on to attack defenses where ma
chine guns remained undamaged,
suffered heavily. Others captured
positions with slight losses.
Instead of compelling the Germans
to lessen their efforts at Verdun, the
Anglo-French offensive seems to have
increased their determination, possi
bly in the hope of preventing the
French from sending reinforcementa
to the Somme.
The Russians continue to record
successes, some of great Importance,
along their whole front from Riga to
the Carpathians, They have crossed
the railway between Delatyn, west of
Kolomea and Korosmezo, one of the
main lines between Galicia and Hun
gary upon which the Austrians de
pend largely to supply their armies at
Stanislau and before Tarnopol. Thi3
places the army of General von Both
mer in a still more dangerous position
and ho may withdraw toward Lem
berg. Russ Continue to Gain.
In the Lutsksalinet at Baranovichi
and along the Riga front the Russians
also claim progress. German corre
spondents intimate that General Kuro
patkin is preparing an offensive in the
Vilna region.
The situation fn the Caucasus Is
somewhat confusing. Turkish and
Russian reports are more at variance
than usual, both claiming victories In
the Tchoruk region on the Russian
right. It appears, however, that while
the Russian right is drawing back to
ward the Black sea litteral and their
extreme left is retiring across the Per
sian border in Kermanshah district,
their center is continuing to advance
from Baiburt southward to the west
of lakes Van and L'rumiah.
British War Report.
"Near Thiepval, on the Somme front,
we made a further slight advance and
captured a number of prisoners," the
war office announced today.
"South of La Bassee canal, after the
discharge of gas and smoke, we made
successful raids into the enemy's first
line. In one of these the royal Welsh
fusileers especially distinguished
themselves, capturing 40 prisoners, a
trench mortar and a machine gun.
"In another raid the Highland light
infantry successfully entered the en
emy's trenches west of Hulluch. A
machine gun emplacement was de
stroyed, many Germans killed and
some prisoners taken.
"There was no change of importance
on the rest of our front."
