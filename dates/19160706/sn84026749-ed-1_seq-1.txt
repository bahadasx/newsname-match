VILLA ARMY
MOVING NORTH
RUMOR SAYS
pandit Leader Reported March
ing With Large Force South
of Parral.
MAY DELAY WITHDRAWAL
Not Known Whether He Plans
Another Invasion or Merely
to Attack Carranzistas.
On the heels of the conciliatory
fiote received from General Car
ranza, proposing negotiations look'
ing to the better protection of the
border from bandits, the State De
partment today received rumors
that Francisco Villa, the notorious
bandit leader, at the head of a
large force of followers, is south
or rarrai, imnuanua, moving
northward.
To what extent this information
may delay a withdrawal of the
American forces will depend, it
fvas said, on whether Villa is aim
ing t oattempt another invasion of
)merican soil, or is planning mere
ly to attack Carranzistas.
NO WORD ON FIGHT.
The Department has no confirma
tion cf the report that Villa waa tn
personal command of the Vllllsta
force which met and defeated the
Mexican detachment under General
Ignaclo Ramos at Corral Ranch, fif
teen miles southwest of Jlmlnes, in
an all day fight yesterday.
.From Information received here.
Villa, throughly -recovered from his
wounds, has been recruiting a targe
force of followers In the mountains
of northern Durango and southern
Chihuahua.
There Is no confirmation, however,
of reports that the bandit leader, dis
gusted with the conciliatory attitude
adopted by Carranza, has declared
war on both the United States and
the de facto Government of Mexico.
Will Answer Note.
Secretary Lansing had a twenty-minute
conference with the President to
day regarding the Carrama note, after
which, on leaving the White House, he
let It be known that a reply will be
ent shortly.
It s thought that the Secretary him
self will prepare It before leaving to
morrow for his vacation.
It was Indicated that the reply will
accept the proposal of Carranza for di
rect negotiations, and that these parleys
will be conducted through the customary
diplomatic channels.
At the same time It was made plain
at the State Department, that, however,

At the final hearings of tho House
subcommittee on the norland resolu
tion for an Investigation of the Beef
trust by tho Federal Trade Commission
a petition was filed signed by 125
members of the House asking the Judi
ciary Committee to report the resolution
favorable Immediately.
It Is understood the resolution will be
reported In time for the House to act
on It next week.
Besides complaint that packers Jaave
manipulated prices. Congressman Bor
land, In a final statement prepared for
the committee, declared American pack
ers aro building up a line of packing
houses In South America and Australia
enabling them to fix even export prices.
Packers in Control.
"Packers are In control of the great
loan companies which furnish money to
farmers for the feeding and fattening
of cattle," said Borland. "They also
have In their grasp a number of sub
sidiary activities such us the cotton
seed oil mills, which supply oil
for feedlnk purpose and cold stor
age plants. This Investigation should
bo undertaken with a . view, of
course, to enforcing the criminal laws,
but moro especially for discovery of bet
ter economic methods and remedial
legislation which will make the Industry
of the widest possible benefit to the
country."
The first witness of the packers before
tho committee today was Arthur Meek
er, general manager of tho Armour
Company.
Prospects for cheap mean In the United
States In the Immediate future are Um.
This Information Is contained In a report
on live stock production In the eleven

' Livn Stock Decrease.;
While Indications are that there will
be a gradual Increase In the output of

accompanied by an Increase In produc- '

This decline Is believed to have been due
principally to the settlement of public
lands and a consequent reduction of the
range.
Tho prediction that this decrease will
give way to an increase Is based on the
oouer mat me amount or live stock on
farms will be greater In the future, that i
the carrying capacity of the stock j
ranges on the public domain may be In
creased by legal regulation, and that '
high prices of range animals and better
methods rIH result In a more efficient,
utilization of the available forage. I
Situation Changed.
In 1914 It was estimated that no moro
than 30 per cent of the new settlers had
more live stock than was necessary to
supply them with work and milch ani
mals. The situation In this respect,
however, has changed, It is stated, ana
the -movement for the production of
more life stock may be expected to con
tinue because both market and agricul
tural conditions make this Indispensable
to really successful farming.
'lhe change will be gradual. It is be
lieved, and only a few head of stock
will be added to each farm, but ulti
mately the Increase will be greater man
that which Is likely to be accomplished
In any other way.
In addition to this increase In the
numbers of farm stock, there Is little
doubt that the carrylnar rarmrltv r.r n
existing ranges can be greatly enlarged.
This has been demonstrated In the na
tional loresis, wnero improved methods
and regulations have Increased the ca
pacity or many ranges from la to s
per cent.

The cost-of-living stories of five

The House passed a resolution
several weeks ago for an investiga
tion of the cost of living in the Dis

Labor to make the inquiry as to
living conditions here. Congress
man Keating, author of the resolu
tion, obtained consent to print cer
tain data in the Record later.
STORIES NOT EXCEPTIONAL.
He Insorted that data In today's
Record with the statemont that "It
Is believed theso stories are not ex

HEAVY LOSSES ADMITTED BY BERLIN
War Office Annouhces Fall of Works at
Belloy-en-Santerre and Evacuation of
Village of Hem British Make
Progress, Too
BERLIN, July 6 Tho German war office this afternoon
officially admitted that the French have captured Belloy-en-Santerre,
south of the river Somine, and that the Germans hare also
evacuated the village of Hem, en the north bank.
The war office also admitted the British made minor progress,
obtaining a firm foothold in the salient south of Thlepval. Be
tween the Ancrc and the Somme, along the British front, the
artillery fire has increased.
On the Verdun front, enemy advances southwest of Fort
Vaux have been repulsed.
PARIS, July 6. A strong German counter-attack
north of the Somme last night recaptured from the French
two small woods on a front of two-thirds of a mile north of
the village of Hem, it was officially announced today.
"The French retaliated, carrying a wood northeast of
the same village," added the official statement.
"On the south side of the Somme the night was rela
tively calm.- A German attack on Belloy-en-Santerre was
easily repulsed.
"Seventy-six guns and several hundred mitrailleuses
already have been counted among the booty taken by the
French since the present movement began."
Amsterdam reports say the Kaiser has arrived on the
l Somme front with his general
FURTHER ARTILLERY PREPARATION.
The lull in the fighting south of the Somme last night
was probably due to the necessity for further artillery prep
aration before the French resume their advance on Peronne.
Since the French advance south of the river began last
Saturday morning, General Foch's troops have taken the
! German second lines on a witf e front, but now face new and
strong defensive positions before Peronne.
With French troops now almost in the outskirts of Pe
ronne, the Germans are re-enforcing heavily, particularly, on
their right flank northwest of the village. Southwest of
Peronne heavy fighting occurred yesterday, in which French
cavalry took part and the famous French "75's" did terrible
execution.
One cavalry detachment, breaking through a gap in the
German second line, actually approached close to the Pe-ronne-Chaulnes
railway, before being driven back by Ger
man fire.
DETACHMENT CUT OFF.
So rapid was the French advance south of the Somme
in the early stages of the fighting that German detachments
were cut off during the night in some instances and sur
rounded before they knew they were under attack. A French
company which cut off the avenues of retreat from one
German trench found several of the occupants asleep in
their dug-outs.
The region south of the Somme over which the French
are now advancing is full of historic interest. In the village
of Barloux, southwest of Peronne, and in the line of the
French advance, the Germans in 1870 installed artillery for
the purpose of bombarding Peronne.
The village was honored after the war with the decor
ation of the Legion of Honor for its heroic resistance to the
Germans.
The town of Peronne was a strong fortress in the me
dieval ages. Charles the Simple was imprisoned and died
there. Peronne surrendered to Wellington in 1815 and to
the Germans in January, 1871, after a most stubborn re
sistance. BRITISH MAKE FRESH ADVANCES.
LONDON, July 6. A further slight advance for the
British in last night's fighting at Thiepval, northeast of Al
bert, was reported by General Haig, British commander-in-chief,
this afternoon. The British took some prisoners.
South of the La Bassee canal, the British made suc-
staff to direct the defensive.
