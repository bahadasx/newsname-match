LONDON, July 5.—(10:17 p. m.)—
The French continue to make more
progress than the British on the west
ern front, owing partly to the more
difficult ground facing the British and
also to the fact that stronger forces
are opposing, because of belief among
tile Germans that the main attack in
the present operations would be on
tlie British front.
But, despite their slower progress,
the British are successfully beating
back heavy German counter attacks
which have been delivered both day
and night in the regions of I.a Bois
selle and Thiepval, and generally be
tween the Aucre and the 3om
where they are makir- tihraria'*
ress. State
It is estimated tha
losses in the battle of tl._ , on,s
far are approximately 60,000. Thr
capture of guns has been compara
tively small, because tlie Germans, in
ant'/'ifpa.tion of tlie offensive, with
drew, their big artillery to longer
ranges before tlie battle began.
According to aerial observations on
the French front in tlie direction of
Peronne there are now only three
more trench systems between the
French and open country and if a
break can he made in tlie German
lines here it would be extremely ser
ious for the Germans, who are doubt
less hurrying up reinforcements, to
make secure the threatened point. The
Germans are sending reinforcements
to tlie battlefield from as far as Ver
dun and Lens, and It is thought that
tlie continued heavy German attacks
on the Meuse may be intended to con
ceal important transfers of troop s be
hind the German lines.
A report from Holland indicates that
tlie Germans have prepared a counter
offensive between the Belgian frontier
and Arras, where it is rumored a for
midable concentration of artillery is
being made.
The operations on the Russian
front show not the slightest diminu
tion in their intensity. Both Austrian
and German official communications
testify to the desperate nature of the
battle. The Germans are olTering
stubborn resistance to the Russian
offensive in the Baranovitoh region,
but, on the whole, the Russians ap
pear to have the advantage here anil
also in the Lutsk region. In the Cau
casus, however, tlie Turks seem to be
more successful in holding up the
Russian advance. According to a re
port from Constantinople by way of
Vienna, the Turks have driven tlie
Russians out of Kernianshah.
The Italians are keeping up their
.strong fight and altogether tlie view
of tlie whole military field continues
promising from the standpoint of tlie
entente allies.
Meanwhile, the political field has al
most as absorbing an interest. The
Rumanian government is said to be
greatly impressed by the recent mili
tary successes of tlie entente allies,
and today's news i s that the two op
posing political parties in Rumania
have already Joined forces in favor of
a pro-entente policy. Hopes, there
fore, are revived here that Rumania
soon will he found in active co-opera
tion with the allies.
There Is reason to believe that, al
though the British government and its
allie* disavow any real change in pol
icy as a result of the abandonment of
the Declaration of London, steps have
been taken in the neutral countries of

VIEWS OF GERMANS
BERLIN, July 5.—(Via London,
11:27 p. tn.)—In view of the fact that
the initial attack of every offensive
is hardest to withstand, owing to tlie
unavoidable effect of surprise with
superior masses of troops, and accum
ulated ammunition, the military crit
ics here are unanimous in consider
(
ing that the great offensive in the,
west has made a showing which can- ■
not encourage Germany's opponents. ■
Major Moraht, in tlie Tageblatt,
calls the Anglo-French successes :
"very scanty." He writes:
The critical moment for the
cess of a great attempt to breach a j
line is the time between the beginning
of the enemy infantry attacks and of

WAR NEWS IN BRIEF
By Associated Press.
The entire second positions of
the Germans south of the
Somme, over an extent of ap
proximately six miles, has fallen
into the hands of the French,
who have also captured the vil
lage of Hem, near the northern
extremity of their line, and have
completed their conquest of Es
trees. The British line has, ap
parently, made no advance, ex
cept slightly in certain sectors,
as the British war office puts it.
Rumania has again come into
the limelight and talk has been
revived of the possible entrance
into the European war of that
country. Dispatches tell of the
recent decision of the two strong
opposing factions in the Ruma
nian political arena to act to
gether in the future. Their atti
tude is said to be in favor of in
tervention on the side of the
entente allies.
Constantinople officially re
ported that the Russians have
been driven out of Kermanshah,
in Western Persia, while the
Russians claim to have broken
the Turkish line east of Baiburt.
The number of Russian pris
oners captured south of the
Pripet river in the month of
June, according to the statement
from Vienna by way of Berlin,
reached more than 23,000 men.

Massing of 100,000 Guardsmen on the Mexican Border Is Believed by the
Officials to Have Been the Impelling Influence Which Induced General

Which Unfriendly Communications He Now Treats as a Closed In

ico, between American and .Mexican
troops, appeared tonight to have been
dissipated by an American cable note
from General Carranza delivered lo
the slate department by Ills ambassa
dor-designate, Kllaeo Arredondo. The
note proposes that the diffi
tween the government,, he settled by |
mediation or by direct negotiations. II
is remarkable for Its brevity, its re
strained and friendly tone ami for the
absolute lack of any ,,f the strong,

as significant, however, of a feeling
on his part that (lie crisis l s over.

was notable that there were almost as

Balloon Goes Up.
The balloon ascension at the Great
Northern depot was the next at Iran

In-one. The ascension took place
about 7:30 and a clean, calm atnio
sphere made all conditions favorable.

It wus up to Main street again for
everybody and, while the hand played
in tlie middle of the square between

great spectacular feature of the day,

PRESIDENT WILSON THANKS HENEY
FOR GENEROUS SUPPORT PROMISED
LOS ANGELES July 5.—A telegram
from President Wilson expressing sat
isfaetlon "because of tlie support so
generously promised" was given out
for publication tonight by Francis J.
Heney one of the leaders of the pro
gressive party in California, who lias
pledged his support to the president
in the forthcoming presidential elec
tion. Mr. Heney's action was an
nounced here in a statement July 2,
through tlie Woodrow Wilson Inde
pendent league,
lows:
The telegram fol- j
"The Honorable Francis J. Heney, Los j
crumont purposes to employ all effort
that may lie at it* disposition to avoid
reoccurruncp of any now incident
which may complicate and aggravate
the situation. At the same time, it
hopes that the American government
on its part may make use of all effort,
to prevent also new acts of ils inili
tary and civil authorities on the Iron
tier, Hint might cause now complica
tions."
While the object of negotiations Is
llms dourly outlined, nnd appears nc
ceptnhle to the state department, the
subjects to he considered specifically
will have to he arranged later. Presi
dent Wilson has made It clear time
anil again Hml gradual withdrawal
of the expeditionary force would ho
ordered, ,,iico lie was ussureil Hml the
t'urninzu forces would ho employed In
breaking up liundlt preparations for
new raids.
II has been noted already that Iho
Mexican 'troops have occupied and
policed the territory relinquished by
General Pershing, ns he drew his men
northward. Army officials believe that
litis, taken In connection with tho
new assurances given In today's note,
may lead to complete withdrawal of
Hie force as rapidly as Is possible
without endangering Ihe border.
In effect, the latest note proposes
that the clock he turned back lo the
lime Immediately following the Co
lumliiiH raid, and when negotiation!!
were afoot for the passage of Ameri
can troop* into Mexico, in pursuit of
Ihe raiders. Conditions have changed
since then, General Carranza having
assembled a considerable army In
northern Mexico and the United States
having Failed the enlisted nallonal
guard Hie line for patrol duty. If
Ih regarded as improbable Hint lliev
plan for American pursuit of bandits,
except possibly within limited areas,
where a hot trail is followed and no
Carranza troops are available, will lie
discussed in the new negotiations.
A plan for border cantonmeuls. In
which reference Is made In tho note,
was proposed by General Obregon at
Ids conference In El Paso wllli Major
General Heolt, chief of stuff of (lie
army. General Scott, would not con
sider It then because II wus founded
on tho stlpuliillon Hint General Per
shing's column would he withdrawn
inmicdliitcly. That stipulation, in ef
feet, now is revoked and unquestion
ably American officials now will give
Ihe pin ii serious consideration.
General Obregon proposed that at
necessary Intervals, along the border,
camps of Mexican and American
troops be established opposite each
other on their respective sides of He
line. Information as to bandits'move
ments would lie interchanged by the
camp commanders and military opera
lions against the raiders lie conducted
Jointly, although each force would re
main within it* own territory. With
100,000 or more natlonnl guardsmen
at the border. It would lie possible to
establish the American camps in a
way to make It practically Impossible
for raiders to escape If real co-opera
tion were given by the Mexicans.
The mobilization of the guard con
tinued today at full speed. It I* cer
tain there will he no Immediate alter
ations in the war department's plans.
Probably a reduction of the border
forces would lie ordered only after
some co-operative plan of action had
been agreed upon witli tlie Mexican
government, and should lie tried out
sufficiently to leave no doubt as to
Its practicability.
Officials believe that the call for
