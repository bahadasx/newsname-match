The interest In the Maysvllle Chau
tauqua continues and yesterday's pro
grams Interested all who attended
Fortunate Indeed Is the person who la
to attend all the numbers, or In fact,
any part of the programs.
Dr. E. F. nnugherty, the morning
hour lecturer, gave his last talk, his
subject being, "The Shams of Conven
tion." His lecture was based upon
Harold Bell Wright's famous novel,
"The Ryes of the World." During his
stay In this city Dr. Daugherty gained
a large number of admirers by his
earnestness and the effective way In
which he presented his themes. It Is
with deep regret that, the people of
Maysvllle see him leave.
In the afternoon the American Girls
gave a splendid concert. There are
six memebers in the company and
their program Included vocal numbers
and selections on saxophones, violin,
cornet, piano, clarinet and other in
struments. Their songs and character
impersonations were satisfying and
frequently quite amusing. This com
pany seems to put to naught that old
piece, "Vou Can't Play Rvery Instru
ment In the Hand."
Not the least enjoyable of the week's
entertainments was the "Mother Goose
Festival" in the evening. One hundred
young folks gave a forty minutes pa
geant that was very unique and ap
pealed strongly to parents and friends,
as well as to the boys and glrlB who
took part. The entire pageant was
presented in costume.
This was followed by a short, but
very pleasing concert by the Ameri
can plrls.
Frederick W. Maurer, the only sur
vivor of the Stefansson Arctic expedi
tion, was the lecturer for the evening
and his wonderful Btory. "A Fight For
Life In tho Arctic," wan well illus
trated and many of the Incidents were
Intensely dramatic. Maurer wi rea
died September 7, 1914, after the
world bad thought the entire Stefans
son party had perished.

CARRANZA'S NOTE
Knd CrMs With Mexico llortiment
Sent H first thief Short and I
VMM Krlendl).
Washington, July 6 Early resump
tion of friendly diplomatic conversa
tions with the de facto government of
Mexico to the end that peace and order
may be restored In Northern Mexico
end along the border is expected here
to be the next step of the United
States In relations with its southern
neighbor.
The crisis precipitated by Villa's
raid on Columbus, N. M., and cul
ti.lnatlng in the fight at Carrizal, Mex
ico, between American and Mexican
troops, nppeared tonight to have been
disBlpated by an amicable note from.
General Carranz.a presented during
the day by his ambassador here, Kllseo
Arrendondo. i
The note proposes that the differ-.
ences between the governments be
settled by mediation or by direct nego
tiations. It Is remarkable for Its
brevity, its restrained and friendly
tone nnd for the absolute lack of finy
of the strong, even Insolent Innugnge
which characterized the last two com
munications from the do facto govern
ment. It treats as a closed Incident
the exchange of unfriendly communi
cations which brought war almost
within sight
No formal comment on the note was
obtainable from State Department of
ficials. A copy was forwarded to the
White House Immediately upon Its re
ceipt and President Wilson will de
termine the course to be pursued. The
fuel that Secretary lanslng completed
tils preparations today for a month's
vacation to begin Friday, Is regarded
as significant, however, of a feeling
on his part that the crisis Is over.
AlWayi for Mediation Principle
As a matter of general principle the
Washington government always hns
favored mediation of any dispute sult
iible for such procedure There is ev
ery indication, however, thai in the
present Instance it will be deemed
li nimble to conduct the coming ne
gotiations directly with the Curranzn
government.
Members of the I jit in-American dip
lomatic corps bare ure expected to
make inquiry sood as to the attitude
of the Washington government, in
view (,f the statement of the Mexi
can foreign office that It awaits onlv
a decision here as to whether illa
tion or dlrort negotiations would be
I referable. Indications tonight were
tl'Ut the Inquiries would be met with
MMMM0M t lint the two governments
hud reached a stage where they would
not find il necessary to cull upon tie
friendly services of their neighbor
states
Miss nianehe Kiddle of Aberdeen
narrowly escaped being drowned
Tuesday night She was returning
from the Chautauqua and had reached
the Ohio side of the river. Hhe was
attempting to step up on the ferry
when she slipped and fell Into the
river. Had It not been for her pres
ence of mind In grasping an Iron bar
and holding on until help arrived
there might have been a different
story. As it was she only received a
thorough wetting.

NOTES
W'ickliam Is. playing a sensational
game ou third. He is an excellent
player and with another season's ex
perience should go higher.
Williams secured four clean sin
gles out of five trips to the pan yes
terday. He is batting like a demon
now and here's hoping that ho keeps
it up.
Umpire Tin me hill is giving the best
of satisfaction during this series. Of
course some of his decision are poor
but he is the best that has been here
for many moons.
The game was one of the ahorteBt
ever played on the local field lasting
only an hour and five minutes After
the third the teams seemed to play to
get it over with as men on the bases
were left entirely alone.
Charleston beat the Old Taylors at
Frankfort yesterday and continues to
occupy third place with Maysvllle. The
locals cati not possibly finish lower
than fourth as there Is one and one
half games between her and Frank
fort. The team however expects to
finish third and there la no reason why
they should not.
