In the Case
Yacht and Fishing Smack ;;
Race For Love, and
Both Win.
By DAVID WATSON
Copyright by Frank A. Munsey Co. T
The Daybreak slipped out of muddy
Mbeinnrle canal in tow of lier polished
mahogany launch just as an unnil
vorous fog sifted in from Hampton
roads Commodore Keelson's trim
schooner yacht was on the way via
(lie inside route from his leafy winter
home at Ortona, Fla., to his cool sum
mer retreat at Uivermoutli. on the
Maine coast.
Needless to say the owner was not
aboard.
Captain Martin Gale, her fat little
sailing master, wasn't going to cry
baby, at a little fog. especially ns lie
was his own boss for Ac time being.
So lie pointed her down the ship ehau
"W1IAT DO you KNOW A COOT JENNIE UID
BEIlT? ' HE DEMANDED.
net through a thick weal her bedlam of
whistles, horns and bells, into which
her own patent hair raiser boomed its
own doleful contribution.
Off Hampton while the skipper was
debating with the mate whether to an
chor inside Old Point or to keep on up
the bay two bare spars loomed in the
smother straight ahead. An instant
later, with two helms rolling vainly
hard over and tw« -OHehops rumbling
down under foot, the yacht had side
swiped the stranger with a bump that
made both craft reel.
The funny part of it was that Cap
tain Gale, bellowing an impotent warn
ing through his megaphone, had in
stantly recognized in the oilier vessel a
Gloucester fisherman commanded by
an old townsman of his, whom lie lmd
not seen since he gave up fish killing
for the lure of blue broadcloth and the
grip of a brass bound wheel.
In fact, the recognition was mutual.
But the greeting of brawny Captain
Andrew Sponson of the White Sea
lacked some of the spontaneous cor
diality called for by a five years' sep
aration. He looked overside and took
stock of damage, then remarked:
"What do ye think ye're doin'?"
Sponson's churlishness should i>e ex
plained lest lie make enemies. In the
month since the White Sea had come
south with a fleet of seiners to convoy
tile seething shoals of mackerel on
their annual jaunt up the coast from
Ilatteras she hadn't made enough to
keep lier crew of eighteen in shoelaces.
All this didn't look much like Spon
son's getting married in June to the
finest girl In Gloucester. an»l here he
was with another repair bill on .bis
hands.
"Sponson was alius as full of sass as
an egg is of meat," Gale assured ids
mate loudly as (lie vessels drifted
apart and swung to tlieir anchors.
The peaceably disposed Gale later
hoarded the fishing schooner in his gig
for a chat with 1ns old shipmate. But
Sponson. brooding over Ids loan sea
son and with his crew of huskies dis
cussing afresh "the White Sea's luck."
was not a very cheerful companion.
"I'm hoodooed, that's the long and
short of it!" he declared. "I cal'iatc I
couldn't have found room between
Fort Monroe and Willoughby bcaoli to
, git.by your hooker."
"All there is to it, Andy." said Gale
! sympathetically, "you've got to git a
j decent vessel. ITow in Sam ITiil do ye
I expect to git around with the rest of
i the fleet in a rusty old trap that can't
! git out of her own way. let alone no
! body clse's?"
"You wouldn't by no chance want
to sail that flat bottomed catamaran of
j youru with (he White Sea, would
j ye?" he inquired with elaborate polite
ness, waving an eleven inch hand to
ward the port hole which framed the
handsome Daybreak, dim in the fog.
"By golly. I'd like to oblige ye." said
the gold braided yacht captain, "but
we're Inkin' things easy this trip,
goln' up the inside rouV*."
"All the more reason why ye can
spare a little time," jeered Sponson.
"Think up r. better excuse than that.
Owner wön'i let ye, truth was known."
"Well, I don't mind givin* ye a go
out here in the roads in the moiuin'. if
it's clear," < needed Gale.
"Bah!" snorted the misanthrope.
"I don't mind admittiu' to ye that
there's only one tiring I'd like to do
now more than wallop this old box of
youru, and that is''—
"To git enough to cat for once!" fin
ished Sponson scntentiously.

and set down into that easy chair In

overlooking his host's rudeness.
"What do you know' abont Jennie

Why, man, you jest keep out of Jen
uie Hilbert's parlor!"
"My i>oor feller," said Gale, "I'm
afraid your hard luck's gone to your
bead. Now, if 1 took ye anyways but
joke, I could show ye' somethin'—and
dinged if 1 don't!"
He tore open his ample blue coat and
yanked a fragrant wad of pink envel
opes from a tight breast pocket. A
faint perfume filled tin» smoky cabin.
While a pudgy fist guarded the pre
cious documents Sponson was allowed
to gaze for a brief instant at the magic
Words:
"Y'our ownest Jennie."
"You got anything you want to per
dure as evidence ng'in' that?" de
manded Gale triumphantly.
As if in a daze Sponson drew out
another bundle of letters in Identical
stationery and Gale stared at the fate
fill line:
"Always your own Jennie.''
"I don't bite for a cent!" sniffed
Gale. "Tiie writin's different."
"The perfumery ain't," said Sponson,
with something like a groan, "and it's
easy enough to change handwrltin'."
"Oh, have it your own way, ye big
leg and arm factory!'' said Gale wea
rily. "We won't have to fight about it
She'll tell ye where you git off fast
enough when ye git back to Gloshter."
"You pile out of liCrc of we will !>e
fight in' about it!" shouted Sponson.
"Well, I must l»e gittin' back aboard.
What time do ye caPlato to git out of

allowin' it clears?''
Sponson appeared not to have hoard
for a moment. Then he .said absently:
"Oil, not till the tide ebbs—8 o'clock,
I cal'iatc, allowin' it cj^ars."
"Well, good luck! Soiry we couldn't
fix up that little race," said Gale, seem
ingly anxious to heal the breach.
****•••
As Sponson was ostensibly only go
ing out to the grounds again to dog the
mackerel there seemed no reason why
lier crew should have got her under
way so stealthily wlieu the silvery
moon rays leaked through the first rift
in the clouds about mkwighf.
And os Gale was avowedly going
home leisurely through the canals
there seemed no excuse« why he should
have followed the Gloucester man to
sea so feverishly when the anchor
watch routed him out and apprised
him of her departure.
The inference is that Captain Gale
and Captain Sponson "knew" each oth
er of old.
Four days later the schooner-yacht
Daybreak boiled In past rocky Mon
ta uk Point wing and wing before a
southwesterly gale.
She certainly hadn't passed the I:
few days in "dawdling among the lily
pads." The planking was gone from
pads." The planking was gone from
lier bulwarks amidships, and the stan
chions stood up lonely.
Captain Gale regarded Ihe wild sky
dubiously, shook his head, consulted
his barometer again and ordered the
reefed mainsail lowered.
"I hate like the deuce to go in," he
said, "but I cal'lute the Vineyard will
be plenty good enough for us tonight'
The mate, with an arm in a sling,
agreed promptly.
But ;:s the outer jib was downed off

fleet of comfortably anchored shipping

ed through it up the harbor.
"By the great hook block," lie fumed,
"if there ain't that slabsided plug of
Sponson's in there to an anchor! Where
in the name of the gods and little fishes
did lie drop from? Well, this harbor
ain't big enough to hold us both to
night, that's all! We'll run over to
Hyannis, and then we'll have a thirty
mile start on him when the weather
gits straightened out again!"
******
Of course Gale had no right to risk
his owner's property so recklessly, and
Sponson, though he owned the \\ bite
Sea. was hardly within the bounds of
common sense in leaving a potential
season's catch 500 miles behind and
racing madly northward.
It all goes to prove owe more John
Gay's two-huiulred-year-old assertion,
"When a lady's in the case you know
all other things give place."
The contemptuous eye of Captain
Andrew Sponson had seen the maneu
vers of the yacht, which lie had be
lieved hundreds of miles astern.
Though iiis sails were hardly furled,
he got tiie White Sea under way again
and deftly ran out of the crowded har
bor under beadsails in pursuit of his
fleeting rival.
Next morning, if the glass of the
marine observer at Highland Light
could have bored the thickness of the
furious easterly storm which lashed
the sands beneath him, it would have
revealed the wallowing sehoonefs Day
break and White Sea, nearly abreast,
heading resolutely across Massachu
setts bay under balance reefed lower
sails.
The marine observer, too, hardened
though lie was, would have marveled
at thought of their night's experience
in the wild gale which had raged off
Cape Cod since early in the evening be
fore.
The course of each was laid for East
ern Foint and Gloucester, sixty miles
to the north.
The yacht's spindling topmast had
finally succumbed, and the last shreds
of a ruined foretopsail flicked straight
out from the masthead, but the loss
of this top hamper was a blessing rath
er than anything else.
Gale appeared to realize that his
was a losing fight. In such weather
the fisherman was at her best, and the

a
battle across the bay would be a long
one.
Storm demons seemed to shriek in
the tense rigging. And then, without
warning, a screaming squall snapped
the White Sea's main sheet. . Sponson
knew that it should have been replac
ed long ago, but his schooner was al
ready in debt.
The great boom shot off against the
lee rigging like a catapult and buckled
at the impact with a terrifie crack.
The White Sea drove into a trio of
small Niagaras as she came to reluc
tantly at Sponson's more reluctant
command, and the crippled mainsail
speedily whipped itself into streaming
ribbons. A storm trysail was bent on
the main gaff, but in a few minutes it
went the way of the mainsail.
Tiie skipper bitterly realized that he
was out of the race. He was a fool
to have expected anything more than
the beastly luck which had chased him
all the spring. Perhaps lie was even
ready to believe i\ hat Gale had said
of Jennie. At any rate, lie led a mad
attack on tiie snarl of thrashing spar
and tortured canvas and as promptly
staggered back and collapsed uncon
scious on the flooded deck.

"The White Sea's luck," said the
crew resignedly.
Then Big Len Gunnel, the seine
heaver, took charge. The wreckage
tied up beyond further mischief, the
plunging White Sea, her bravado sud
denly wilted, was put broad off before
the gale.
To windward tbe Daybreak, igno

adieu and went on.
Around the knuckle of Cape Cod

The crew did.
Early next morning a small boat,
with a comely middled aged woman
and a fluffy haired, brown eyed girl,
came alongside, the latter feathering
her oars with the touch of a man-of

"Darnntion!". grumbled Big Len.

do the honors, but the cook knew a
thing or two and made himself scarce.
So it was the perspiring seine heaver
who took their painter and meekly
ushered them below, repeatedly assur

that the skipper merely "had the bark
rubbed off."
"My land, Andy Sponson," began the
relieved Mis. Hilbert, restored to her

good news, "why don't you tidy tilings

"Why, Mother Hilbert, aren't yon

at the edge of Sponson's bunk. "If

Governor Stewart Makes Plea
For Improved Highways.
OLD TRAILS AND NEW.
When the Pleasure Vehicle Came Into
Use the Question of Better Roads
Appeared as a Small Cloud Upon the
Community Horizon—Modern High
ways Meet New Conditions.
Time was when any sort of avenue
of communication between communi
ties was looked upon as fairly ade
quate, writes Governor Sam V. Slew
art of Montana to the Anaconda Stand
ard. The country was sparsely settled,
demands for hurried communication
were negligible and methods of trans
portation were "of the crudest. The
chief user of the trail, which through
courtesy was sometimes dignified by
the term "big road," was the freighter,
the bullwhacker, who knew that be
tween the beginning and the end of his
trip lay n long strip of soil whereon he
might expect any variety of weather
and encounter soils that were of vary
ing degrees of preparedness for his
train. But the fact worried him not at
all. -He employed the best means at
hand and relied upon the almost un
limited power of ills humble animals to
pull him through.
But the wheels of progress made a
revolution or two, and the pleasure ve
hicle came into use, whereupon the
question of better roads appeared as a
cloud the size of a mail's hand upon
the community horizon. Tiie advocate
for something better derided the frail
that had served the population for a
time and began to cry for highways.
The difference between a trail and a
highway is vast in comfort, in utility
and in cost, and the latter item had
much to do with keeping the move
ment back. A hit or miss system was
evolved whereby a little work was
done at long intervals upon the roads,
and then for long periods they were
left to take care of themselves. The
result was partially satisfactory so
long as nature was kind and the
long as nature was kind and the
weather of a character to make travel
pleasant. But at times the elements
conspired against the roadmakers, and
it was often the case that the driver
found as much of his vehicle below the
surface as above it
By and by men began to figure from
the economic side of the question, and
it was found that in the road that lay
between tbe farmer and Liis market
was to be found the difference between
a balance and a deficit when it came
to marketing his crop. It required no
argument to demonstrate that the man
who could make a trip to mnrket In
one day where he had formerly occu
pied two days was making a pro
nounced saving—was economizing in
horseflesh and in farm utensils and
winning an extra day that would prove
of value to liim In his ranch work.
Evolution in machinery building
brought us finally to the automobile,
the pleasure vehicle and the truck, and
the question of improved highways be
came one of pressing importance. The
owner of the pleasure car cried aloud
for a better roadway, and the farmer
joined in the chorus because it had be
come possible for him at a moderate
outlay to bring himself many hours
nearer market, provided the roads were
in passable condition. The combina
tion of rural resident and city owner
and city business man was irresistible.
To meet the condition thus brought
about is now the problem engrossing
the attention of city, county and state
authorities the country over. Engi
neers arc giving their best thought to
the problem of evolving the best metb
od of road building at a minimum ex
pense, anil the authorities are striving
to give the people what they are call
ing for in so far as tlio funds available
will permit.
The difference between good road^
and tin* bad variety is the difference
between industry and sloth, between
pride and carelessness, between tbe
don't care community and the com
munity that will be satisfied with noth
big short of the best. The transition
from a road of quagmires and ruts is
not one that can be wrought In a day
or a year, but the county that devotes
every possible energy each year to ac
complishing 1 lie utmost in tiie way of
highways thereby marks itself as pro
gressive and filled with the vision of
greater and better things to come from
improving the resources at its hand.
One of the greatest benefactors of
our time was he who made it possible
to transport two tons over our country
roads where less than one could be
transported before. The Inventor and
the manufacturer have made It possi
bio for tiie people to live in far great
er comfort, to travel in luxurious ease
aud to thereby win a competence where
such a thing was impossible under old
conditions, and the people owe it to
themselves to discharge their implied
obligations. I believe that, so far as
Montana is concerned, they are doing
this, and the time is coming, and not
far distant at that, when the number
of good roads enthusiasts in the state
will tally exactly with the number of
citizens on the census rolls.

millions wasted on roads
Lack of Intelligent System Has Caused
Big Leakage.
Millions of dollars have been wasted
on road building because there has
been no continuity of purpose, no co
ordination of management, no central
ization of control in the work, accord
ing to the American Highway associa
tion. The plan pursued, so far as
there has been any plan, lias been of
the higgledy-piggledy, here a little,
there a little order, and with generally
disappointing results. The national
government does not exercise any ad
ministrative control over public roads
except those built on government res
ervations, and until recently the states
took no direct part in the construction
of improved roads, which for nearly
half a century were controlled and
financed by tbe county or by subdivi
sions of the county, so that the public
road which should be operated for the
benefit of all the people was in fact
nothing more or better than "a purely
local utility."
Down to the present time about RU,
000 miles of improved highways have
been constructed under the immediate
direction of the several state highway
departments. In 1914 the states ex
pended in round numbers $50,000.009
for road purposes, ami in 1915 the ap
propriations available for this work
amounted to about $55.000.000. In ad
dition, (he local expenditures aggregat
ed about $200,000.000 in 1914. In 1904
the total amount expended by the
states, counties aud townships for road
purposes in the United States amount
purposes in the United States amount
ed to about $SO.OOO.OOO. In the course
of ten years the expenditures on this
account nearly trebled. That there is
not more to show for it is due to the
lack of intelligent anil responsible sys
tem in the planning und building of
the roads. In the states that have
adopted the policy of centralized state
management the largest percentage of
improved highways is to be found.
Massachusetts heads tiie list with 51.7
per cent of improved highways. Ohio
follows with 39.8 per cent. New Jersey
takes third place with 30.3 per cent.
New York is fourth in order with 27.9
per cent, and Connecticut is fifth with
10.2 per cent improved roads. All these
states have had state highway depart
ments for more than ten years.
Road Roller Made of a Boiler.
One of the old style boilers without
an attached fire box or an upright one
makes a fine road roller. In building
ryads in a southern state one of these
boilers was used. A hole was drilled

and tongue for a (cam of horses.- Tlio

The Worst Thing For Good Roads.
Perhaps the worst tiling which could
happen to the cause of good roads

local burden will lighten it.
