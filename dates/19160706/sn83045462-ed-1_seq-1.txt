MEXICAN TROUBLE
The President Decides Upon
Course After Conference Today
With Mr. Lansing.

Amicable Adjustment of Difficulties
Is to Be Conducted Through Regular

TROOPS MAY BE WITHDRAWN
Intimation Given at White House
That Movement May Be Ordered
as an Evidence of
Good Faith.
~ Formal acceptance of Gen. Carranza's
proposal that differences
between the I'nited States and
the de facto government of Mexico
be settled bv direct negotiations
will lie dispatched soon to
Mexico City. This was decided
by President Wilson today at a

sing President Wilson will personally
word this reply, it is
stated 011 excellent authority.
All negotiations between this
government and Gen. Carraniea
will be conducted through regular
diplomatic channels, and directly
between the two governments,
it is understood.
May Withdraw the Troops.
An intimation was given at the White
House that as ad evidence of good faith
orders will soon be issued through the
War Department for the gradual withdrawal
by Brig. Gen. Pershing of his
force from Mexico.
The Mexican note delivered yesterday
said the de facto government had
accepted in principle Latin American
offers of mediation, but was awaiting
information as to whether \he United
States believed the desired results
could be accomplished by direct exchanges
between the two governments.
Secretary Lansing will leave tomorrow
for a month's vacation. It was not
stated today whether he would have an
opportunity to read the reply to Mexico
before his departure, but indications
are that it will go forward within a day
or two at most. s
Secretary Will Keep in Touch.
The Secretary will be in direct touch
by telegraph and telephone with the
White House and State Department j
during his absence, but informal con- j
versations with Eliseo Arredondo. Mexban
ambassador designate, which, it
s hoped, will develop a solution of the
difficulties along the Mexican border,
wii! be conducted by Counselor Polk,
acting as Secretary.
Secretary Lansing was with the President
about twenty minutes. He said
they went over most of the important
matters now before the State Department.
*1 suppose that we discussed fifteen
or twenty different propositions," he
said. "As I am going on my vacation
tomorrow. I wanted to discuss everything
of importance in the department
with the President before I left. I
shall attend the cabinet meeting tomorrow
morning and start on my vacation
later."
None Will Make Prediction.
While Gen. Carranza's amicable reJoinder
to the last two American notes
has greatly eased tension, no official
was willing today to predict the final
outcome of the negotiations which are
foreshadowed. It was made plain,
however, that no change in policy was
now contemplated by the Washington
government and that immediate withdrawal
of Gen. Pershing's expeditionary
forces from Mexico will not be an
, acceptable basis toif whatever plan of
co-operative action along the border is
worked out.
Washington officials take the position
that only the preliminary step has been
taken by Gen. Carranza toward the
friendly adjustment he now appears to
desire. Demonstration of his ability
to carry out the promises expressed
and implied in his note is still lacking.
President Wilson, it is pointed
out. has been ready to withdraw American
troops from Mexico at any time
the de facto government would express
the intention and show the ability
to furnish adequate military protec
t!on for the border.
To some extent this demonstration is
now being made by the operations of
Mexican troops in the 300-mile stretch
of Chihuahua state, formerly policed by
American forces. The Carranza forces
have moved into the territory as Gen.
Pershing drew his lines northward and
the best information at the War and
State departments indicates that they
have patrolled it thoroughly.
President Now Confident
of Amicable Adjustment
of Whole Mexican Affair
Relaxation over the Mexican situation
brought with it today the understanding
that President Wilson personally
will devote time from now on to efforts
to reach a definite understanding with
Gen. Carranza that will have for its objects
the gradual withdrawal of American
troops from Mexico and the satisfactory
patrol of the Mexican side of
the border by a sufficient number of
<*arranza troops to insure protection
against bandits, or at least protection
to communities in which there are
many people and valuable property.
The President is understood to be

MEMPHIS, Tenn., July 6 (on
board the second section of the
District National Guard Special).
?The District National Guard
special reached here at 12:12 p.m.,
carrying the 'first troops from
Washington toward their concentration
camp in Bisbee. These
consist of the Field Hospital and
Signal Corps and the 1st Separate

A citizens' committee met the
train here and escorted many of
the soldiers to the Y. M. C. A.,
where they enjoyed the swimming
pool. It was the first bath J
the District soldiers had since
leaving Rosslyn Tuesday night,
and on account of the heat of the
train and the flying cinders they
felt much in need of it. Practically
all the men took advantage
of the opportunity. Some few
who are suffering from the
typhoid prophylaxis-" treatment
were advised by the medical officers
not to expose their arms and
shoulders.
Refreshments were served at the rail-road
station here by a group of young
women associated in Red Cross work.
j 11 was mucn appreciaiea oy me oujb ?l?
a-variation from the regular "mesa"
served aboard the train and cooked under
difficulties. The boys aleu igwjuj ed
the chance to talk to the women, several
of whom took addresses of the
men's relatives in Wasldhgton, so that
they can write and give assurance that
the District soldiers are well and happy
as they proceed toward border duty.
Like Small Camp.
The section of the train on which the
Signal Corps and Field Hospital units
of the District National Guard are riding
to the border country looks like an
army camp in concentrated form. There
are company streets, headquarters,
commissary departments and kitchens.
Each unit has its officer of the day. The
only things lacking are bugle calls and
tents.
The section is being pulled by two
locomotives. Then come two box cars
in which the heavy equipment of the
two units is packed. Next in line are
two tourist sleepers, where the Signal
Corps is quartered. A baggage car.
which serves as a kitchen for the two
units, is next. Following are two tourist
sleepers, in which the field hospital
men are riding. Nine flat cars loaded
with reel carts of the Signal Corps
bring up the end of the train.
How Coaches Are Divided.
The forward sections of the first
coach assigned to each unit are re- j
served for the officers. One section in
each instance has been designated as
the unit headquarters. Each officer has
an entire section to himself, including
an upper and a lower berth. In the
case of the men a section is allotted
to every three, two sleeping in the
lower berth and one in the upper.
In the headquarters of each unit the
; field desK of that organization has been
set up and *he sergeants spend most
of their time there keeping their records
in order and attending to other
routine business.
The forward half of the baggage car
is utilized as the kitchen for the Signal
Corps and the rear half for the Field
Hospital. Each unit has its field
range. The smokestacks project from
the window openings and are held in
place by wires. The Signal Corps cook
throws his potato peelings out of the
i center door at the right-hand side of
i the, car and the Field Hospital cook
uses the other door.
Kitchens Well Supplied.
Each kitchen has a big supply of
wood. There are many chests of canned
goods, sides of bacon, sacks of
I potatoes and onions and cans of coffee.
: Arranged on boards fitted up close to
I the ceiling are many big loaves of
j bread.
I There is a generous supply of canned
! sirup and fruit jam.
When meal time arrives tables are
| set up between the seats and the milij
tiameu get out their mess kits. The
: kitchen details bring big cans of
! coffee, soup and other food through the
cars and each man gets a generous
share. When the meal Is over a big
can of hot water is placed in the vestibule
between the cars and everybody
flies out to wash his "dishes."
4'Camps" Are Policed.
The "camps" are policed regularly
! and the officer of the day sees to it that
everything is in as good order as possible,
under the circumstances.
From -every -hook- and bracket -in the
coaches the personal equipment of the
men is hanging. When night time conies
this is taken down and placed qnder
the lower berths. There Is a regular
Pullman porter attached to each car,
but he has little work to do. He made
up a couple of berths the first night,
and by the time he had finished them
the majority of the militiamen had
caught on to the trick. They promptly

HOUSE DEBATING
THE REVENUE BILL
r
Special Rule Adopted Calling
for Final Vote Monday
Afternoon.
$125,000,000 REQUIRED
FOR MEXICAN TROUBLE
Necessity for Legislation Grows Out
of Increases for Army and Navy,
Committee Reports.
Debate on the administration
general revenue bill began today
in the House under agreement to
reach a final vote Monday. The
measure, reported favorably yesterday
by the ways and means
committee, provides a'method of
raising $200,000,000 additional
revenue from taxes on inheritances
and war munitions profits
and by increasing the surtax on
incomes.
Large appropriations for army,
navy and fortifications are the
principal factors making neces
1 * 1
sary tne increased revenue provided
by the bill.
Representative Garrett of Tennessee,
acting chairman of the House rules committee,
reported a special rule for immediate
consideration and expedition of the
revenue bill. It proposed general debate
until 6 p.m. Friday, reading at the bill
and amendments under the ffve-minute
rule and final vote at 5 p.m. Monday. Mr.
Garrett explained that extraordinary conditions,
with which the country was familiar.
had required expenditures beyond
the ordinary' expenditures of Congress;
that to meet these expenditures the Treasury
must have money, and that the democratic
majority party, "willing and ready
to meet its responsibility," has formulated
plans for raising the additional revenue.
.He contended that the rule reported was
plain, simple and liberal.
Representative Bennet of New York,
republican, attacked the rule and the
democratic party. He said the rule showed
"the evil effects of persistence and bad
habits," and that the House under the
party in power was resorting persistently
1 to rules to pass bills. Many members on
both sides engaged in the discussion over
the rule. j
After the House had adopted the special
rule by a vote of 124 to 112, Democratic
Deader Kttchin made the opening speech
on the bill.
He contended that the republicans
and democrats having voted for the
national preparedness measures without
regard to party afiiliations, they
should likewise eliminate party considerations
in voting to raise the revenue
to meet the preparedness expenditures.
He charged that it was unfair
and unpatriotic to refuse to help
finance the government under the present
extraordinary situation. He thai
lenged the republican minority to point
out a better or wiser way to raise the
revenue, and declared that they could
not do It by raising the tariff.
Mexican Affair Necessitates Issue.
An estimate of $125,000,000 worth of
bonds, to be issued to finance the
United States' end of the Mexican situation.
is contained in the report from
the ways and means committee.
The committee report also says that
the necessity for revenue legislation
"grows out of. the extraordinary increase
in the appropriations for the
army and navy and fortification of our
country."
The fiscal situation is summarized in
this way:
"Estimated excess of disbursements
over receipts for the fiscal year ending
June 30. 1917, $266,922,000; additional
receipts under the proposed bill, income
tax. $107,000,000; estate tax, $17,000,000
(and it is estimated that the annual receipts
from the estate tax will amount
to $54,000,000 when the law is in full
operation); munition manufacturers'
tax. $71,000,000; miscellaneous taxes,
$2,000,000. Total additional receipts,
$197,000,000. Balance to be taken from
general fund, $69,922,000.
"Fortunately the balance in the general
fund June 30, 1916, was much larger
than at the end of any fiscal year since
1908. After deducting $59,000,000 for disbursing
officers' balances, there remained
in this fund over $177,000,opo.
"After deducting $69,922:000 from this
fund as above there will still remain June
30, 1917, in the general fund over $100,*000,000
exclusive of the disbursing officers'
balances. It is estimated that the total
appropriation for the fiscal year ending
June 30, 1917, will not exceed $1,579,000,000.
This includes $125,000,000 to meet
the extraordinary expenses or disbursements
occasioned by the Mexican situation.
"This and any other appropriations
that may be necessary to meet the abnormal
and extraordinary expenses which
may be incurred on such account should
be financed by bond issues, as is always
done by this and all other nations under
similar circumstances.
"In estimating the actual disbursements
it is proper to deduct the sinking
fund requirement included in the
nermanent aonronriations at tfin 797 fiftft
for the fiscal year 1917, and also the
postal appropriations, estimated at
$324,723,000, payable from the postal
revenues. It is also safe to deduct as
unexpended an equivalent to 5 per cent
of the total estimated appropriations
remaining after these deductions. Deducting
the sinking fund and postal appropriations
and the 5 per cent of the
balance as unexpended and the estimated
$125,000,000 of bonds to finance
the Mexican situation leaves $1,015,122,000
as the amount for which it is
necessary to provide revenue. The estimated
revenue under present laws is
$748,200,000. Estimated excess of disbursements
over receipts, $266,922,000."
It is probable that no other country
derives as much revenue per capita
from the people through consumption
taxes as does the United States, the report
says, adding that the revenue system
should be more evenly balanced
and a larger portion of revenues collected
from incomes and inheritances
of those deriving the most government
benefit.
Receipts from the income tax under
the bill are estimated at $227,000,000
annually. The proposed estate or inheritance
tax is to be levied . upon
transfer of net estates, after deducting
all valid claims and an additional exemption
of $50,000.
Canada, Denmark, France, Germany,
Great Britain, Italy and Sweden, it 13
pointed out in the report, have laws
similar to the proposed munitions tax.
In approval of a section of the bill imposing
special duties on dyestuffs, the
report says the committee has decided
like Great Britain and Japan "that this
war anomal| as it affects dyestuffs can
only be de&t with in a manner that
under normal conditions would not be
wise. Justifiable or necessary*

MRS. WYLIE FILES SUIT
FOR ABSOLUTE DIVORCE
Action Recalls the Alleged Elopement
of Her Husband in
December, 1910V
Mrs. Katharine V. H. Wylie today
filed suit in the District Supreme Court
for an absolute divorce from Horace
Wylie, whose alleged elopement December
16, 1910, with Mrs. Elinor M.
Hichborn caused a sensation in society
and club circles. Mr. Wylie is a son
of the late Andrew Wylie, a justice of
the Supreme Court of the District of
Columbia. Mrs. Hichborn is named as
co-respondent and the court Is told
that their present address is unknown.
In her petition, filed by Attorney William
Henry Dennis, Mrs. Wylie tells of
her marriage April 30, 1895, and that
there are four children.
She declares that she lived with her
husband in this city "in mutual affection
as petitioner supposed" until December
16, 1910, when, she asserts, her husband
disappeared from their home, leaving a
written confession that he had eloped
with Mrs. Hichborn, who had left her
husband, Philip S. Hichborn. She declares
it then became matter of public
notoriety that the defendants had eloped
together, going first to Canada and then
to Europe.
In 1911, Mrs. Wylie says in her petition,
her husband twice came to the
United States from Europe to see
her with the avowed intention of
effecting a reconciliation, and in
the summer of 1911 he went along:
with her and the children while traveling:
in Europe. He suddenly departed,
she alleges, September 26, 1911,
leaving a message to the effect "that
the separation from her was final, and
he must go back to and live permanently
with said co-respondent." The
wife asserts that he did rejoin Mrs.
Hichborn.
Mrs. Wylie recalls to the court in her
petition the filing of a petition for absolute
divorce, January 6, 1912, by
Philip S. Hichborn against the co-respondent
named in her bill based on the
alleged elopement of Mrs. Hichborn
with Mr. Wylie. While the Hichborn
case was pending, the court is told,
Philip S. Hichborn committed suicide
March 27, 1912.
Unless she obtains a divorce, Mrs.
Wylie says in her petition, with custody
of the children, Mr. Wylie, should
he survive her, might lay claim to a
paternal authority over the children,
which, she asserts, he hag forfeited
both in law and in morals. To preclude
any such claim on the children, she
avers, is the reason for filing her suit.

NEW ORLEANS. July 6.?Loss of life
is feared to have resulted at points in
Alabama and Florida swept by the
tropical hurricane yesterday, although
communication with the sections over
which the storm passed had not been
established early today.
The center of the hurricane apparently
struck Mobile, Ala., and Pensacola,
Fla., and the section between those
points, according to local weather bureau
officials. The storm moved inland
in a northwesterly direction from the
Gulf of Mexico at an estimated velocity
of about eighty miles -an hour.

hurricane appeared to be moving northwest
between Jackson and Meridian.
Miss., at a velocity of about forty-eight
miles an hour, and apparently lessening
in intensity.
All trains on the Louisville and Nashville
railroad to Mobile and all
through trains were canceled last
night, and none had been sent out
from here nor had arrived early today,
owing to washouts and flooded tracks.
Telegraph and telephone companies
reported all wires down to the Mississippi
coast section and to Mobile and
Pensacola.
Fears entertained here for the safety
of residents of Grand Isle and Barataria,
on the southeast Louisiana coast,
were lessened today, when it was indicated
that the full force of the hurricane
had not struck those sections.
Several boats were sent to take out the
inhabitants.
Mobile Wireless Towers Wrecked.
NEW ORLEANS, July 6.?The United

BIRMINGHAM, Ala., July 6.?The
wind and rain storm of yesterday and
last night has done great damage to
the Louisville and Nashville railroad
south of Greeneville, Ala., and all the 1
way almost to New Orleans, according
to advices at the offices of the road
here. Telegraph wires are to be repaired

Attempt of French to Advance la

Official German Statement.
LONDON, July 6, 12:35 p.m.?
Having captured the whole Ger
* iv -1 -I* -1
man second line soutn 01 tne
Somme from the river to Belloy, -
the French have resumed operations
north of the river and have
cleared the bank almost to Clerv.
The French, who have established
themselves at Sormont
farm, also threaten Clerv*.
The British still are heavily
engaged all along their front,
from Hardcourt to Gommecourt.
Notwithstanding heavy German
counter attacks they have
been able to maintain all the
ground gained and extend it at
some points.
Wiped Out by Artillery.
Jl s the German trenches are oocupied,
evidence accumulates of tha
deadly execution of artillery. In some
cases 80 per cent of the defenders
were killed by the terrific shelling to
which they were subjected. British
losses vary. Certain formations being'
called on to attack defenses, whers
machine guns remained undamaged,
suffered heavily. Others captured the
positions which had been set as their
objective with very slight losses.
Instead of compelling the Germans to
lessen their efforts at Verdun, the
Anglo-French offensive seems to have
increased their determination, possibly
in the hope of preventing the French
from sending reinforcements to the
Somme. British observers express satisfaction
with the progress which has
been made. With the heavy casualties
caused by the bombardment and the
taking: of 16,000 prisoners and a great
quantity of war material, together with
the subsequent losses inflicted in counter
attacks, it is believed here that the
German power of resistance must have
been weakened.
British Advance B-eported.
An official statement issued today
says:
"Near Thiepval (on the Somme front)
we made a further slight advance and
captured a number of prisoners.
"South of La Bassee canal, after the
discharge of gas and smoke w*e made
some successful raids into the enemy's
first line. In one of these the Royal
Welsh Fusiliers especially distinguished
themselves, capturing forty prisoners,
a trench mortar and a machine
gun.
"In another raid the Highland Light
Tnfantry successfully entered the
enemy's trenches west of Hulluch. A
nachine gun emplacement was destroyed,
and many Germans were killed and
some prisoners were taken.
"There was no change of importance
:>n the rest of our front."
French Have Quiet Night.
PARIS, July 6, 12:10 a.m.?Last night
