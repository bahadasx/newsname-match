London, July 4 Convoys of wound

their cheerfulness and high spirits
and their supreme confidence that
tho tide of battle has turned. Somo

who wnslanded nt Southampton with
a holo through ono -hand and an ug
ly shrapnel wound in tlw leg, said:
"Our fellows reached their objec

German machlno guns were sweeping
that portion of tho front with an ab
solute hall of lead, but our only trou
ble wns to prevent them from charg
ing right into the thick of it before

"Tho officers were splendid, all of

Chawnor. Ho found hlmeelf face

HAZEL DAWN
AT THE LYRIC
FRI. AND SAT.
Hazel Dawn, the beautiful fair
haired stor of tho Famous ' Players
Film Company, makes a sensational
success In that leading producing;
company's' latest Paramount plctuto,
The Feud Girl, Miss Dawn with a
cast of prominent players which In
cludes rving Cummlngs, Arthur Mor
rison, Hardee Kirkland, Gertrude Nor
man and George Majcronl, enacted
tho drama in perhaps- the most pic
turesque districts of Georgia under
tho careful supervision of Director
Fred Thompson.
As tho title implies a feud exists
between two bands, the Haddons and
the Bassctts, tho Inhabitants of tho
wild and rugged southern mountain
region. Tho chief bono of conten
tion is tho big mountain which llej
between them, Iron Mountain. Tho
railroad engineers, discovering the
Invaluable territories lying In the
wake of these warring factions pro
ceed to unlto them.
Nell vlladdon a typical care freo
daughter of the hills, hates tho Bos
sett clan with the same vehemence
as does the rest of her clan. With
tho arrival of tho railroad officials,
comes a youth named Dave Hand; a
mutual lovo springs up between the
two young people. Through the per
suasiveness of tho railroad official,
Haddon is induced to marry Nell to
ono of the Bassett clan. Nell hears
of tho plan nnd anounces that eho
would ruther marry an ymember of
her clan than one of that hated tribe,
She decides to let the men draw
straws for her hand. Davo Is admit
ted Into the contest aftor much op
uosltion from Luko, nn ardent ad
mirer of Nell. When he draws the
losing straw Noll quickly changes it
behind her back. A fight starts im
mediately between Luko and Davo,
the winner taking tlie girl. Davo
throws his enraged rival with re
markable skill. Nell's father swears
to kill Dave on hearing of tho af
fair, but ho suddenly recalls Davo's
influence with tho railroad and the
.Bassets; ho decides, therefore, to be
come reconciled to his son-in-law.
Davo cleverly brings about tho
meeting of the clans. They stand
face to face on a loveled field. Nell
Is staggered when sUo sees Davo In
the ranks of the Bassets and for the
first time learns thot ho is one of
tbem.
Only tho .quickest ncllon on the
part of tho women prevents a clash
bptwecn tho two clans when the de
ceptlon is discovered. Nell and Dav.o
part company, tho boy returning tn
his own clan by whom ho had long
been thought dead.
As tho weeks roll on Nell's con
sciousness that she is soon to fulfill
her greatest mission In life turns bcr
thoughts towards her husband, whom
sho loves despite his decoption. Thu-
It is that motherhood ultimately
unites tho clans of Hnddon and Pas
net after years of continuous fighting.

Charles E. Hughe Deliver Fourth
of July Address Rejoice to B
Under the Flag
I
Brldgehampton, N. Y. July 4.
Charles E. Hughes, speaking at tho
nearby village of East Hampton, to
day told a Fourth of July audience
what America needs Just now abovo
all other things is an Intelligent com
prehension of tho Ideals of democra
cy. He asserted that the nation
needs more than thrills In Its patriot
ism, and Bald his dream of America
was of a country officered by Its best
men actuated by no thought of self.
He dovoutly hoped, tho nomlneo de
clared, for a now birth of tho senti
ment of unity from the country's
present perils.
"We are not a rnsh people," ho
Bald. "We are not flllod with n spirit
of militarism. We aro not anxious
to get into -trouble, but If anybody
thinks that tho Bplrlt of service and
sacrifice is lost nnd that we havo
not got the old sentiment ot self re
spect, he does not understand tho
United States'."
Mr. Hughes Bpoko from n knoll on
tho village 'green. Ho motored over
from his summer home horo to re
view the vlllego preparedness par
ade and had not intended to address
the crowd. At tho closo of the pro
gram, however ho consented to speak
brlofly.
Ambition I Realized
"I have been long on sllenco and
short on talk," ho said. "It is nn
odd oxperlenco that I am going thru
picking up tho threads of old rela
tions. I think I have wea at leabt
five years in the last threo weeks.
When I arrived in New York n short
time ago and my former socretary
and my former aide met mo, and wo
resumed our many delightful con
tacts, It seemed to mo as though
there' had been suddenly dropped
from my life a period which repr
tinted tho highest ambition I had
cherished.
"Ono of tho plcasontest Incidents of
my return Is to bo Bojournlng with
ou in the shadow of tho 'American
flag. Wherever that flag floats there
Is shrine. I dont care in what
part ot this favored land oxcrcises.ln
celebration of tho anniversary ot our
Independence aro held, thcro Is cause
of rejoicing,, because of opportun
ities whlcnjonly Institutions like ours
can afford j
Backed By Patriot
"It Is all very well to talk about
tho declaration nnd tho strong Bcntt
monts which it contains, but that was
backed by men men who could not
have indited If, men who could not
havo committed It to memory, men
who could not havo tepeated It, but
men in whoso lives was tho lncarna
atlon of Independence and whose spir
it wns breathed into that Immortal
document.
"H Is because wo lind men who
ero willing to suffer, to die, to ven
ture and to sacrltlco that wo havo the
country, nnd It is only by that spirit
that wo will over bo nblo to keep a
country. I lovo to think of those hard
men coming horo with tho spirit that
led all pioneers farther nnd farther
west tho same spirit which In every
part 'of our Inn" I"19 accounted rr
cur development. Quiet men, not
noisy men, sensible men, not foolish
men; straight men. honest men, de
pendable men. real men-thntts whit
what wo mean by Americanism.
There is a vast amount of good Judg
ment in this country, much more thon
Iho hcndllnos ot our nowspnpers seem
. indicate. There Is a vast amount
of thoughtfulncss In this country.
"Wo aro not n rnsh people Wo
are not filled with a spirit of milltar
l&ra. We are not anxious to got in
troublo, but if nnybody thinks that
the spirit of eervlco and sacrlflco is
lost and that wo hnvo not got the
old sentiment of self respect ho does
not understand tho United States.
"I nm not going to mako a speech,
but, I do want to say a word to you
along these lines: We want patriot
ism, and I don't think wo aro going
to loso it very soon, although I do
dovoutly hope that out of the perils
and difficulties of, this time may c6me
a new. birth, ot the sentiment of unity.

New Version of the Clash at Mazat-
Ian; Refugee Arrive at
San Diego
San Diego, Cal., July 4. Bearing
639 refugees, tho naval transport
Buffalo arrived hero tonight from
Guaymas and Mnzatlan, Mexico.
Among the refugees were forty Brit
ish subjects and a small number of
other nationalities. Tho majority de
clared they left west Mexican coait
ports and points in tho Interior In
obedience to American consular warn
ings and not becauso of fear tor
their lives or property.
Nearly all of tho refugees had tho
few personal effects they could pick
up prior to the Buffalo's departure.
Many of them were practically penni
less and these were given asslstanro
by tho San Diego chapter of tho lied
Cross.
A new version of tho recent clatfli
at Mazatlan between American sail
ors and Mexican soldiers was brought
hero by persons who refused to per
mit their names to bo used. It was
.to the effect that Ensign O. O. Kos
sing and Assistant Paymaster O,
Mowat of tho gunboat Annapolis, who
were temporarily hold prisoners aft
er Booking- to parley with port offici
als, were saved from being shot only
through the Intervention by tho wlfo
of the American consul. It was dur
ing this encounter that Boatswain's
Mate Laughter, wns fatally wounded
Another story heard for tho first
time hero was that a purty of Amer
ican bluejackets from thi cruiser
Cleveland boarded the Interned Am
erican steamer Sonora at Guaymas
nnd under cover of darkness cast
loose tho anchor chain, threw over
board .tlw Cnrran7a watchman and
towed? tho vessel out of the Harbor.'
It was said the Sonora, sheltered by
tho Cleveland, wns used to house ref
ugees until tho Buffalo's arrival.
Among the arrivals were 162 Am
erican employees of tho Southern Pa
cific of Mexico received nt Kmpalmo

men, nearly all skilled employes, left

might wish to avoid nny seizure of

"Tho United States does not seek
