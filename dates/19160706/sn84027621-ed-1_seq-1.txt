Result of their Great Offensive
L0I1G EXTEIIDED SWEEP Of THE
London, July 6 A slight advance
near Thiepval on the front where the
French and British are making their
drive against the Germans is record
ed by the British war office. A num
ber of German prisoners were taken.
The French war office reports the
night generally quiet north and south
of the Somme river.
; TEUTONS ADMIT DEFEAT ,
Berlin, July 6. Repeated Russian
attacks have caused the withdrawal
of part of Gen. Bothmer's army in
Galicia ta the neighboring sector,
says the German war office.
In the Somme region, the Germans
have evacuated Ham, village The
French have captured Belloy en San
ta rre. . : ."" . ; Y' -
CLEARED THE BANK TO CLERGY
London July "6. -Having captured
the whole German second line .de
fenses south of the Somme from the
river to Belloy, the French resumed
their operations north of the river,
and cleared the bank almost to Clery.
BRITISH LOSSES HEAVY ' .
The British are still heavily, engag
ed from Hardecourt to Gommecourt.
They have maintained their recent
gains and extended their lines some.
Evidence of the deadly execution of
tbeir artillery is found as , trenches
are taken. In some eighty per cent
of the defenders were , killed.. . The
British losses were very heavy where
machine guns Were undamaged by the
bombardment; in other places the loss
was slight. , v ' y
British observers believe the Ger
man resistance was weakened by the
heavy casualties of the bombardment
and counter attacks, taking 16,000
prisoners and a great quantity of war
material by the allies. ' t
CONTINUED RUSSIAN SUCCESS
The Russians continue to record
sucesses, some of importance, along
.the whole front from Riga to the Car
pathians. They have crossed the rail
way between Delatyn and Kensomezo,
one of the main Atistrians channels to
supply armies at Stanislau and Tarn
opol. It is thought this may cause
General Bothmer to withdraw toward
Lemberg. . .. . ,
HAVE TAKEN HAM . :
The entire second line positions of
the Germans, south of the Somme
river, over a front approximately six
miles, has fallen into the hands of
..the French, who have also captured
the village of Ham, near the northern
" end of their line; and have completed
the conquest of Esteres. While none
of the ground gained by the British
has been lost, the British apparently
have failed to advance except slight
ly in certain sections. The number
of German prisioners reported cap
turetf by the British and French is
about sixteen thousand and the Ger
man casualties are estimated unoffi
cially at sixty thousand. . The Ger
mans report taking a -considerable
number Of British soldiers.
GERMANS ATTACK IN LORRAINE
Only bombardments are under way
on the Verdun front, " but the Ger
mans have opened a new attack on
the French line near the Lorraine
frontier, east of Luneville.
LEMBERG THREATENED
Petrograd reports that the Russi
ans have cut the railroad running
" from Lemberg to Delatyn, which is the
main line of communication for the
Austro-Germans defending Lemberg.
Allied military critics say this will
compel the Teutons to fall back on a
wide front. and endanger Lemberg.
Vienna reports twenty-three thou
sand Russians were captured south
of Fripet during June.
RUMANIAN RUMOR REVIVED
Talk of Rumania's possible entrance
into the war is revived with the an

Col. A. H. Blanding, commanding
the Second Regiment mobilized - at
Black Point, has organized a machine
gun company from among the com

completion all the necessary units to
complete " the regiment entirely are
mobilized and ready to proceed to the
border. The machine gun company
of the regiment is in command of
Capt. Shields Warren of Gainesville.
Quartermaster stores, consisting of
shoes, underclothing and other neces
sities are being issued to the men to
day. Ordnance stores are 'also being
issued. Colonel Blanding announced
today, and it is expected that within
the next several days all ordnance as
well as quartermaster stores will have
been supplied the men.
It was stated this morning that in
stead of using mules the machine gun
company which has been mustered in
will use motor trucks. Five trucks
and four. Lewis automatic machine
rifles will be K furnished, but it is
probable that these will not be sent to
the state camp grounds, but to the
border, to be furnished upon the ar
rival of the regiment at the concen
tration point.
PHYSICAL PREPAREDNESS
Is an Imperative Necessity of . Public
Education
New York, July 6. The influence
of the war in Europe upon American
schools and the aid the , schools may
give in the maintenance of perma
nent peace, were discussed yesterday
at the annual convention of the Na
tional Educational association.
-Virtually all the phases of public
school education were under discus
sion at sectional meetings. Philander
P. Claxton, United States commis
sioner of education, declared he be
lieved physical preparedness neces
sary. He said he was told by a re
cruiting officer for the United States
marine corps that 41,000 men were
examined in order-to obtain 4,000 re
cruits. At that rate, he said, with
21,000,000 men in the United States,
"we would have only 2,000,000 for de
fense." i
"Three hundred thousand children
die in this country eSrery year from
preventable causes," he continued. "If
we should be invaded and 300,000
children were killed we would do
something about it, but these children
are just as dead as if they were kill
ed, by bombs dropped from aeroplanes.
I have always thought it did not mat
ter much what a chfid knows as to
make its body and' mind ready; for
what life calls it to do." ;

MUST CONTINUE TO PAY
HIGH PRICES FOR MEAT
(Associated Press)
Washington, July 6. High .meat
prices probably will continue. This is
the conclusion of the department of
agriculture as set forth in an exhaust
ive report on the situation made pub
lic yesterday. High meat prices pre
vail throughout the world. One rea
son for this is the fact that produc
tion has failed to keep pace with the
increase in population. Other con
tributory causes given are the in
creased cost of production and dimin
ishing purchasing power of the money
unit.:: '. --V'
An interesting feature of the situa
tion in the United States is that, while
the production of meat is on the in
crease, it is not yet proportionate to
the growth of population.
While holding but little or no hope
for a lowering of meat prices in the
near future, the' report says that there
will be a gradual growth and expan
sion in the world's production of beef,
mutton and pork which may or may
not equal the rate of increase of the
meat-eating population.

SiTUATlDII THAT MIGHT
r
PROVE
Connecting Pipes at the Water Works
' Inadequate for Demands of a
Large Conflagration '
A situation exists at the water
works which might prove very serious
in the event of an unusually large fire.
The situation, moreover, has existed
for years. Two four-inch pipes con
nect the old reservoir, with the set
tling basin, the water flowing by
gravity." Engineer David Henney
called ' council's attention to this last
night, saying that these two pipes
might fail to meet the demands in an
extraordinary case, and recommended
that the two pipes be replaced at once
with a ten-inch connection. Mr. Hen
ney pointed out that the two four
inch pipes really gave no more ser
vice that a single six-inch pipe.
Another thing which Mr. Henney
called attention to was' the - short
stretch of eight-inch pipe connecting
the water works with the ten-inch
main" which supplies the, city. He
pointed out that no more water could
be put through the ten-inch main
than would be put through the eight
inch connection, and he recommended
that a ten-inch connection be put in at
once. - - .
Superintendent Caldwell of the wa
ter works has instructions to make
the changes.

MILITIA GOING INTO MEXICO
Columbus, N. M., July 5. Parts of
the Massachusetts and New Mexico
National Guard will be sent into Mex
ico within the next few days to assist
in guarding General Pershing's line
cf communications. ' -
NO CHANGE OF POLICY NOW
While the Carranza note eased the
tension, officials are not willing to pre
dict the final outcome. They made it
plain that no change of policy is con
templated now. The immediate with
drawal of American forces in Mexico
won't be the basis, of any plan drawn.
PROPOSED JOINT OPERATIONS
Gen. pbregon proposed that at ne
cessary intervals along the border
camps of Mexican and . American
troops be established opposite each
other on their respective sides of the
line. . Information as to. bandit move-!
ments would be interchanged by the
camp commanders and military oper-!
ations against the raiders be conduct
ed jointly, although each force would
remain within its own territory.. ,
With 100,000 or more national
guardsmen" at the border it would be
possible to establish the American
camps in a way to make it practically
impossible for raiders to escape if
real co-operation were given by the
Mexicans. ' '
The mobilization of the guard con
tinues today at full speed. It ,is cer
tain there will be no immediate alter
ation in the war department plans.
Probably a reduction of the border
forces would be ordered only after
some co-operative, plan of action had
been agreed upon with the Mexican
government and had been tried out
sufficiently to leave no doubt as to its
practicability.
In other words, ,a demonstration of
the ability of the Carranza forces to
carry out their, part of the bargain
would be required. Whether such a
demonstration must precede with
drawal of Gen. - Pershing's forces is
not so clear.
Officials believe that the call for the
national guard and the actual dis
patch of the troops to the border was
the impelling influence which induced
Gen. Carranza to abandon the hostile
attitude taken in his previous notes.
They sa ythe United States holds a
strong argument in favor of peaceful
solution of border difficulties as long
as it maintains an army near the line,
and there seems little probability that
it will be withdrawn until all danger
has passed.
Unquestionably if no new bandit
outbraks occur, the national guards
men will be gradually sent baek to
their homes. It originally was planned
that only a part of the force be
on the border, the remainder
sent later to relieve reeiments
had put in the required time atr
service. It is possible that

which meat is carried through the
streets in open wagons, with no cover
over the meat or with a very filthy
one. At the instance of Mr. Tomp
