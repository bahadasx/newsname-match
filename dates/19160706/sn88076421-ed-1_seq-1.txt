TWO KILLED BY CY­
CLONE AT ANAMOOSE
Freda Cook's Skull Crushed-Anna Hu
ber Instantly Killed—Many Build­
ings Wreckcd—Minot Man There.
Freda Cook, aged eleven years, a
daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Fred Cook
of Anamoose, and Anna, the nine-year
old daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Ludwig
Huber, residing five miles north of
that city, were instantly killed in a
cyclone which visited that section of
the state at six o'clock Monday even­
ing, leaving death and ruin in its
wake.
The cyclone, which did great dam­
age to the business section of Ana
moose, started in its work in the
southwestern part of the city, coming
straight up main street, then leaving
the town thru the northeastern portion
of the city.
Black clouds had hung over Ana
moose for three hours threatennig
their work of destruction, so that
when the storm came in all its fury,
the main populace were ready for it.
C. H. Coar of this city, manager of the
Bell Telephone Co., was in Anamoose
at. the time. He says the black clouds
had churned in the skies for hours and
finally the funnel shaped cloud ap­
peared, its color being almost white.
He remained in the telephone office
and persuaded the young woman oper­
ator to stay in the building, realizing
that it would mean almost certain
death to her should she leave. For an
hour there was almost total darkness
in the town.
The following property damage was
done in Anamoose:
Schmidt, Gulack & Heitman Co. gar­
age in the process of construction, and
which was about two-thirds finished,
was completely wrecked.
Near the same building the band
stand was wrecked.
About a block from there the big
windmill of the Soo Line was blown
over.
A number of windows in buildings
off of the main street were blown out.
About a dozen telephone posts in the
main street and other parts of the
town were blown over.
Globes on the Whiteway lamps were
smashed.
The office of Joseph Vettel in Main
street was moved about three feet.
A number of other buildings were
either blown over or entirely wrecked,
while as many more are without chim­
neys of windows.
Signs were blown off the buildings
in Main street and there was a general
distribution of other smaller things
from their appointed places.
The electric light service was sus
pended for several hours. Lightning
struck some buildings, but no damage
came from that source.
The cyclone was followed by several
hours of a most terrific electric storm
It was said to be the worst windstorm
and cyclone, in poin" of damage, ever
seen this far north.
The little Cook girl was killed by
flying debris from the wrecked hen
house. Her mother was in the build­
ing at the time it was destroyed, but
escaped unharmed, being left on the
floor. The flying timbers struck the
little girl, killing her almost instantly.
1ST STOCK SHOW
BIC SUCCESS
Breeders Say They are Satisfied and
Will Return Next Year—Some Fine
Blooded Animals Shown.
The Northwestern Stock Show, be­
ing held in this city this week has
been pronounced by competent judges
to be a thorough success. Not one vis­
itor has expressed himself as being
dissatisfied, but all say that it is bet­
ter than they expected. The breeders
taking part in the show appear to be
satisfied in every way with the treat­
ment that they are receiving at the
hands of the management, and they
say they will be back next year again.
The attendance has not been all that
was desired for the money spent in
getting the show in readiness, but even
if there is a deficit, Minot has made
good once more. The people of Minot
have not yet awakened to the fact that
Northwestern North Dakota is des­
tined to become the home of more
blooded stock than any other section
of the state, and that the Wonder City
will naturally be the city in which to
hold the annual shows and sales. The
breeders are ready, and it remains for
the city to take advantage of a great
opportunity.
The horses and cattle are here in
force, but the hogs and sheep are lack­
ing in numbers, but what there are of
these two latter kind of animals is
made up in the fine quality of the
breeds. This part of the state should
have more sheep and hogs, and next
year it is hoped that the showing will
be much larger than this year.
Judging started the first day, when
the Holsteins and Guornseys passed in
review. Tuesday the horses had the
ring. Wednesday the Shorthorns and
Aberdeen Angus cattle had their inn-

Miss Ida Selma Tufveson, only
daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Nels Tufve­
son, was united in mariage Wednesday
afternoon at 4 o'clock to Rev. Erik
Johann Forsberg, of San Diego, Cal.
The ceremony was performed by
Rev. Nicolay Nilsen, pastor of the Zion
Lutheran church, in the presence of
only the immediate relatives and a few
intimate friends.
Promptly at four o'clock, Miss The­
resa Hegge at the piano struck up the
strains of Lohengrin's wedding march.
The minister and the groom, with his
best man, were the first to enter the
room. The groom was attended by
Thure Erickson, of Overly, N. D., a
cousin of the bride. The bridesmaid,
Miss Nettie Hanson, a cousin of the
bride, came next and the bride follow­
ed alone. The ceremony was simple,
yet very impressive.
The bride, who is a very attractive
young woman, wore a gown of cream
taffeta with an overdress of all-over
lace, trimmed with cream satin. She
wore a beautiful^ lavalier of pearls and
diamonds, the gift from the groom,
and carried a shower bouquet of
bride's roses.
The bridesmaid wore an attractive
salmon colored gown of pussy willow
taffeta with an over-dress of Georgette
ciepe with silver trimmings. She car­
ried pink peonies.
The beautiful Tufveson home was
prettily decorated in pink and white
with bouquets of peonies and carna­
tions and palms and ferns everywhere.
The wedding dinner was served at
5 o'clock in five courses. The tables
were prettily decorated with pink and
white carnations and ferns with the
three tier wedding cake in the center.
The happy couple will leave for the
west Friday. They will visit with sis­
ters of the groom at Spokane and Se­
attle and will travel by boat from Se­
attle to San Diego, where they will
I be at home ofter Sept. 1.
The bride has lived in' Minot prac­
tically all of her life. She is a charm­
ing young woman and will be a valu
able helpmeet to the man of her choice.
I The groom is pastor of the Swedish
Mission at San Diego. He is a young
minister with a brilliant future. The
couple met at San Diego where the
Tufveson family has spent a number
of winters.
The Independent joins the many
friends of the couple in extending
very best wishes for a happy life in
the west.
McLane Returns to Minot.
A. F. McLane, who recently located
in Sioux City, fa., where he took
charge of a territory for a larg insur­
ance company, has returned to Minot,
where he will engage in the insurance
business again. It is possible that he
will take up the work with his old
company. Mr. McLane states that he
does not like the Iowa city and thot it
best to return to Minot at once. He is
one of North Dakota's most capable
insurance men and the many friends of
the McLane family are glad to learn
that they are locating here again.
North Dakota Regiment Inoculated.
Arthur Goodrich received a post
card from Hugh Taylor, one of the
members of Co. D. Hugh says the
regiment at Fort Lincoln has been in­
oculated against typhoid fever. The

it gave them all the head ache. The
boys are training hard and are about

Figures That Unfair Methods Were
Used in the City of Minot Causing
His Defeat at Primaries.
John Wallin, who was a candidate
for the nomination for county treas­
urer on the republican ticket in the
primaries, informs the Independent
that he will be an independent candi­
date for this office in the November
election.
Mr. Wallin gives as his reason that
he figures that he was not fairly beat­
en for the fact that influence brot to
bear on certain elements in the city of
Minot on election day. He points with
pride to the fact that he received a
nice majority in the country precincts
and he believes that had he received
the treatment he deserved in the city,
he would have been nominated.
H. R. Larson Sells Tailor Shop.
H. R. Larsen has disposed of his
tailor shop in this city to Martin Fret

ish and will go to that up-to-date res­
ervation city to establish a clothing
store and tailor shop. Mr. Larson is a

TO LEAVE THE CITY
Zion Lutheran Pastor Will Not Recall
His Resignation Filed Recently—
Goes to Willmar, Minn.
Rev. Nicolay Nilsen, pastor of the
Zion Lutheran church in this city for
the past fifteen years, has definitely
decided to leave Minot. His resignation
has been handed to the board to take
effect early in the fall, when he will
go*to Wilmar, Minn., where he has ac­
cepted a call.
Rev. Mr. Nilsen came to Minot when
this city had a population of only a
thousand. He has seen the city grow
to be one of the foremost in the west,
and he has done his share in its up­
building. The members of his congre­
gation and the residents of Minot and
vicinity in general will see Rev. Nilsen
and his wife leave most reluctantly.
Willmar is a city of 7,000 population
and the Zion Lutheran congregation in
that city is very large. The church is
r. fine structure and Mr. Nilsen will
have ideal conditions for his work.

Lovers of the national game have
been treated to a series of games on
the local diamond during the past week
that would do ci'edit to a town twice
the size of Burlington. On Thursday
evening our boys played the Des Lacs
team, winning hands down, score 4 to
0. The next day we defeated the fast
Berthold team by a score of 5 to 1. In
the game with Des Lacs Walt Potter
pitched for Burlington and did some
mighty effective work, allowing the
visiting team but four hits. In the
game with Berthold Neff occupied the
mound for our boys. His record shows
17 strikeout and three hits. He had
excellent support in this game. E.
Wallace was in fine form and the way
he heaved the pill across-to second was
a marvel to the Berthold team who
have been up against nothing faster
than the Minot aggregation this sea­
son. Amundson at first was on the job
every minute. Dan Conan, the 'Big
Chief," played short, and his playing
made every "old timer" present shout
with joy as Dan "nailed" every ground
er that came anywhere within speak­
ing distance. The denizens of No
Man's Land, horse thieves, whist play­
ers and yarn spinners were out in
force to every game.
Mrs. Zenith Spires has returned
from Joliet, 111., where she has been
the guest of her son, Dr. L. E. Spires
and family during the past winter.
Mrs. Spires says she is glad to get
lack where she can enjoy again the
bracing breezes of the Dakotas.
H. T. Hogy returned on Monday
from Glenwood, Minn., where he went
last week to attend the wedding of a
niece, Miss Lettie Hogy. Mr. Hogy
was accompanied by Miss Hazel Hogy,
who remained for a few days' visit
with relatives before returning home.
The Misses Myrtle Hogy, Grace
Johnson, Rolla and George Johnson re­
turned Saturday from a trip down the
Great Lakes from Duluth to Buffalo,
visiting the cities of Chicago, Detroit
and Cleveland enroute. The young
people had a very enjoyable trip and
are enthusiastic in their praise of boat
travel. The party was joined at Min­
neapolis by Miss Laura Randall who
made the trip with them, stopping off
at the Twin Cities on the way home
where she will spend her vacation with
relatives.
Mr. and Mrs. P. H. Kraemer of Long
Prairie, Minn., parents of Mrs. Herb
Yuly, who have been guests at the
Yuly home for the past four weeks,
returned home Thursday morning. Mr.
Kraemer expressed much interest in
the prospects of this section of the
state, and says that crop conditions are
much better here than in Minnesota.
This is Mr. Kraemer's fourth trip here
to visit the Yuly's and we anticipate
that about the next time he comes west
he will conclude to share his lot with
the Dakotans.
O. L. Spires has moved his family
into the residence vacated by the Joe
Wistrom family on Western avenue.
Fred Sartwell and family have mov­
ed into the Hathaway cottage near
the livery barn. This house has been
repainted and other improvements
made, putting it in first class shape.
The Soo depot has been treated to a
fresh coat of paint and the section
house has also been embellished with
the same colored liquid, thus even the
Soo Line is keeping step with the pro­
gress of events in this community.
Painters are at work giving the Gun
der Livingston residence on east Col

Tufte bungalow is getting the same
treatment. Soon there will not be a
building in town left unpainted.
Harry Miller has a fine new nine
room house on the north side nearly
ready to occupy. This looks mighty
suspicious, Harry. We are inclined to
think the janitor at the "Little Church
Around the Corner" should get busy
and have the bell rope in good condi­
tion.
Mrs. George Wood and children are
visiting relatives at Harvey this week.
During the absence of Mrs. Wood
George is subsisting on an assortment
of doughnuts, pancakes and other vi­
ands which he has been keeping in cold
storage since last summer. We rather
suspect that the reason the 'Little Ger­
man Band' hasn't met for rehearsal
this week is because the members are
fearful that George will "spring" the
effects of his culinary efforts upon
them.
The hardware man says the demand
for padlocks has been unprecedented
during the past week. All residents
with a collection of choice spring
poultry are taking extra precautions
since the advent of Ed Kelley and
John Ehr at No Man's Land. These
two are said to be very keen for fried
chicken.
Jim Johnson is said to be high man
at all the whist games at No Man's
Land this summer. The new electric
lights are a big advantage to the boys
this year, and Frank Kirkelie and Ed
Skinner and some of the boys who
have been inclined to keep a few aces
up their sleeves can't work their old
game as in former years when the
lighting facilities were not so good,
and their misdeeds went undetected.
Jim says that an honest man stands
some show now.
All the old "boys and gals" are get­
ting in trim for the big Horse Thieves'
dance which is scheduled for some
night near 2the close of the annual
festivities. The grounds were never
in better shape than they are this sea­
son. Weather conditions have impair­
ed the fun somewhat, but on the whole
those who are encamped on the de­
lightful grounds of No Man's Land
this year say they are having the best
time they have ever had.
Everyone misses Martin Jacobson
this year as his genial presence has al­
ways contributed so largely to the
pleasures of the Old Settlers in years
gone by.
A general neighborhood picnic was
enjoyed at the John Halvorson grove
or the Fourth. Practically every res­
ident from the south side was there
with the little folks together with a
generous supply of eatable*. Never
was a day spent more pleasurably. as
those must know who have ever enjoy­
ed the hospitality of Mr. and Mrs. Hal­
vorson.
Alvin Wallace was selected to um­
pire the big game between North and
South Prairie at Minot on the Fourth.
Alvin at one time was considered one
of the best players in this section, and
is still one of the best posted men we
have on the standings of the leading
teams and the merits of the players.
North Prairie won by a score of 13 to
5. Kells, who pitched for North Prai­
rie, put plenty of speed and a good
wide curve on the sphere, his work
being too classy for the southerners.
Mrs. Jennie Devol and daughter.
Miss Norma Devol, attended the cele­
bration at the "Wonder City" on the
Fourth and were agreeably surprised
at the splendid manner in which the
enormous crowds were handled. They
were delighted at the magnificence of
Minot's parks, saying that the east has
few park systems which surpass in
beauty and size the parks of the "Won­
der City." Mrs. Devol is the guest
of her parents, Judge and Mrs. J. S.
Wallace, and expects to remain here
for some time, being joined later in the
season by Mr. Devol, whose business
duties at Huntington, W. Va., will not
permit his leaving home at the present
time.
Today a jolly party left here bound
for the lakes of Minnesota where for
the next two weeks they will fish, feast
and otherwise disport themselves, for­
getting for a time that this sordid old
world ever contained such things as
care or troubles to worry them. They
will go direct to Glenwood and from
there will journey to the beautiful
lakes which lie in every direction. The
party was made up of Mrs. Brigham

and family. Miss Tillie Jacobson, Mrs.
Justin Miller, Alvin Miller, Mr. and
Mrs. E. A. Madson, Dr. and Mrs. F. J.

Monday Evening's Twister Carried
Away Large Houses and Barns—No
One Injured—Fund for Victims
A terrible cyclone did in the neigh­
borhood of $10,000 damage in the vi­
cinity of Simcoe, 22 miles southeast
of Minot on the Minot-Fargo cut-off,
about six o'clock Monday evening. The
following farmers sustained damage
estimated as follows:
Andrew Stranberg, house and barn,
$2,500.
John Ihley, house and barn, $2,000.
John Kemp, new barn, $2,000.
John Mullen, barn wrecked and gar­
age lost,$l,000.
Other damage done in the vicinity
will bring the loss up to $10,000 or
over. Fortunately no lives were lost
and no stock is reported to have been
killed.
The clouds could be seen gathering
for some time and finally the twister
appeared in all of its fury. It took an
el-shaped course and came with a ter­
rific rumbling and roar.
thewasafies-
John Ihley, assessor of Hendrickson
township, McHenry county, where the
storm operated, suffered the greatest
loss. His house was unroofed and all
of the clothing from the rooms on the
second floor was carried away. The
men were away but the women folks
were in the house. The home was
practically ruined. A terrific down­
pour followed the cyclone, drenching
the women, but they were not injured.
Mr. Ihley's fine barn, 32x40 was car­
ried away. The only trace that can be
found of it, are a few splinters scat­
tered over the field. The windmill was
torn down.
The funnel-shaped cloud next visited
the John Mullen farm, removing the
large barn from the foundation and
carrying away the garage completely.
The auto was left standing, with only
the fender damaged slightly. The
stock in the barn were not hurt.
Andrew Strandberg had almost fin­
ished a fine large house. This was
blown away together with the old
barn, leaving the old house standing
undamaged.
John Kemp's mammoth new barn
32x60 feet was blown away.
Andrew Lindquist, who watched the
progress of the storm, says that the
cyclone dropped suddenly to earth
taking everything in its path. Six
inches of rain followed the cyclone,
filling the Hendrickson flat. The neigh­
bors are making up a large fund for
Mr. Ihley, who appears to have suffer­
ed the most damage.
W. A. Moran and Frank Eicher of
this city, who own farms in that vicin­
ity, drove out Wednesday to view the
work of the storm.
Sunday School Picnic at Livingston's
Grove.
The annual Sunday school picnic for
the students of the Parochial school
which has been held in McKinley town
ship, will be held at the Edward Liv
ingston farm nine miles northwest of

invitation will be extended to the pub
lie. A lunch and ice cream will be
served.
MISS STOCKWELL
IS A JULY BRIDE
Daughter of Prominent Pioneer Fam­
ily Weds Frank Bennett at
Episcopal Parish.
Miss Ethel Stockwell, daughter of
Mr. and Mrs. Perry Stockwell of Bur­
lington, who are among the oldest
and most highly respected Ward coun­
ty settlers, was united in marriage
Monday evening to Frank Bennett.
The ceremony was performed at the
parish of Alf Saints Episcopal church
by the pastor. Rev. Jas. N. MacKenzie,
at 8 o'clock. Those who witnessed the
pretty ceremony were Sirs. Stockwell,
mother of the bride, Mrs. J. B. Reed,
Mrs. A. Scarlett and Mrs. Bennett,
mother of the groom.
The groom formerly resided at
Brainerd, Minn. He came to this city
several years ago and now holds a re­
sponsible position with the Soo Rail­
way Co. He is a steady young man
and well liked. The bride is a grad­
uate of the Minot College of Com­
merce, completing a course in stenog­
raphy and bookkeeping. She has been
employed by the Scarlett Office Supply
Co. for some time, where her services
are considered most valuable. She is
a young woman of many admirable
qualities and the Independent joins the
many friends of the couple in extend­
ing felicitations.
The Ford car, like the wily Chinese,
"for ways that are strange and tricks
