The Alien Conspiracy Against-Wilson.
The most important plank In the
Democratic platform the most impor
tant plank to any platform is that in
which the Democratic national con
tention denounced the alien conspir
acy against the peace and welfare and
security of the United States.
' The Republican platform dodged
this issue. The Republican convention
dodged it. The Republican candidate
for President has dodged it. The Dem
ocratic party under the leadership of
President Wilson has met it and met
it without flinching.
The issue is fundamental. Undi
vided allegiance Is at the beginning of
government. No nation can Buryive
that is halHdyal and halt-alien in its
sentiments! No country can maintain
free institutions if the balance of po
litical power is in the bands of. men
whose hearts and sympathies are tor-
eign. . '. -

Professional German - American
loaders have long been in a conspiracy
(isainst the administration of the gov
ernment of the United States because
of the foreign policies of the President.
Their sole grievance against Wilson is
that he has maintained American
rights contrary to the military aims
and objects of the German empire
They indict him for his refusal to
sacrifice the law of nations and the
sovereignty of the United States to
farther the military necessity 01 uer-

In revenee for the President's pro-
' Aawrican foreign polioies, the leaders
ot an alien conspiracy have decreed
hii political destruction. , It ia their
Vinaatrhat the control the German
vote and that the German vote will de
cide the election. They have rallied
tA ihe support of Mr. Hughes, not

on the question of whether the gov
