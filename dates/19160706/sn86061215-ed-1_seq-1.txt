Carranza's Letter
,WILSON, HIMSELF,
DELAYS COMMENT
Mediation All Right, Says
Note, But Negotiations
Can Achieve Results
Washington, D. C.t July 5. —The re
ply of the de facto government qf
Mexico to the demands of the United
States, conciliatory in terms and giving
assurances of a desire to reach a
friendly adjustment of the difficulties
between the two countries, was de
livered to the state department today
by a Mexican embassy attache. The
text follows:
"Mr. Secretary:
"Referring to the notes of June 20
and 25, last, I have the honor to say to
your excellency, that the Immediate
release of the Carrizal prisoners was
a further proof of the sincerity of the
desires of this government to reach a
pacific and satisfactory arrangement of
present difficulties. This* government
Is anxious to solve the present conflict
and it would be unjust if its attitude
were misinterpreted.
"It was also the Mexican govern
,. xnent that earnestly suggested a plan
for cantonments along the boundary
line during the conferences of Ciudad,
Juarez and El Paso. This government
is disposed now, as it has always been
to seek an Immediate solution of the
/..• two points which constitute the true
.•*-"f cause of the Conflict between the two
countries, towit—the American govern
ment thinks reasonably that the inse
curity of its frontier is a source of diffi
culty and the Mexican government on
its part believed that the stay of Am
erican troops on Mexican territory,
Aside from being a trespass on the
sovereignity of Mexico, is the immedi
ate cause of the conflicts.
Therefore the withdrawal of Ameri
can troops, on the one hand, and the
protection of the frontier, on the other,
-are the two essential problems, the
Isolation of which must be the direct
ing object of the efforts of both gov
ernments.
"The Mexican government is willing
to consider in a quick and practical
way and prompted by a spirit of oon
cord the remedies which should be ap
plied to the present situation.
"Several Latin-American countries
have offered their friendly mediation
to the Mexican government and the
latter has accepted it in principle
Therefore, the Mexican governmnt on
ly awaits information that the govern
ment of the United States would be
disposed to accept this mediation for
the purpose mentioned above or wheth
er it is still of the belief that the same
results may be attained by means of
direct negotiations between both gov
ernments.
"In the meantime this government
proposes to employ all efforts that may
be at its disposal to avoid the recur
rence of new incidents which may com
plicate and aggravate the situation. At
the same time it hopes that the Ameri
can government on its part may make
use of all efforts to prevent also new
acts of its military and civil authori
ties of the frontier that might cause
new complications.
"I avail myself of this opportunity
to reiterate to your excellency the as
surance of my most distinguished con
sideration.
(Signed) "0. Aguilar."
Note Satisfactory.
As soon as a translation of the
8panish text could be made it was sent
to the white house. Until Secretary
Lansing and President Wilson have
had an opportunity to confer, there
will be no formal comment But some
state department officials did not at
tempt to conceal the fact that they
considered the note most satisfactory
and likely to remove all danger of war.
Troop* Cause of Trouble.
Kief uid free from all superfluous
language of diplomacy, the communi
cation points to the release of the
American troopers captured at Car
rizal as proof of the Mexican govern
ment's sincere desire to avoid a con
flict states as the outstanding issue
the reasonable belief of the United
States that the insecurity of its fron
tier is a source of difficulty and the
belief of the Mexican government that
the presence of American troops in
Mexico is a trespass on that country's
sovereignty and we immediate cause
of trouble.
In offering to consider in a "quick
and practical way" the remedy wVXsh
should be applied, the note gives no
tice that Mexico has accepted in prin
cipal Latin-American offers of media
tion and awaits information that the
United States is disposed to accept
mediation or Btill is of the belief that

ARE BEING TAKEN TO INi
CREA8E DE FACTp ARMY.
El Paso, Tex., July 5.—While na
tional guard organizations on the
American side of the border are being
recruited, drilled and equipped, the
Mexican de facto government is taking
similar steps with volunteer troops,
concentrated in some of the larger
cltieB of northern Mexico, according to
Mexican reports here today.
These report's indicate that large
commands of volunteers have been
mobilized at Chihuahua City, Jlminez,
Parral, Rosario, Torreon and Durango
City and are bein^ drilled daily.
Mexican military tuthorities assert
that these activities are merely "meas
ures of precaution."
COMMAND STILL INTACT.
San Antonio, Tex., July 5.—Failure
of the war department to notify Gen.
Funston of the division of his com
mand was regarded by some military
men today as a reflection of the hope
of the administration that an open
break with Mexico might be avoided.
When Gen. Funston recommended
the plan that would place the big bor
der army on a basis for general field
operations, army officers were con
vinced that war was unavoidable
Should amicable relations be restored,
however, army officers believe the
recommended war measure may be
abandoned.
Gen. Pershing's reports today indi
cated no aggression by the Mexican
troops concentrated close to El Valle.
Notable relaxation in the-movement
of national guardsmen was admitted.
The first big rush was nearing com
pletion. Almost 46,000 guardsmen are
either at border stations or on the way.
MEXICANS THREATENED.
Vinita, Okla., July 5.—Violence "was
threatened the Mexican residents
here last night by a mob of 500, en
raged by reports that a Mexican wait
er had slapped an American boy's
face. A number of Mexicans were
driven from the city while others were
forced to take refuge in the county
jail. Mexican residences and stores
were draped with flags and banting
by the mob. Several arrests were
made.
ME88AGE FROM BRAZIL.
Rio Janerio, July 6.—The chamber
of deputies Tuesday voted to send to
United States congress a message
carrying best wishes of Brazil in com
memoration of the date of North
American Independence and express
ing hope that the United States will
preserve peace on the North American
continent.

EN OUT OF MEXICO AFTER
GIVING UP MONEY.
San Diego, Cal., July 5.—W. A. Hol
ton of St Louis, an employe of the
United Sugar Co. of Los Mochls, Mex
ico, who arrived1 here last night on
the naval transport Buffalo with 538
other American and British refugees
from west Mexican towns and ranches,
said today that he was one of a party
of eleven Americans who were held
recently by Carranza soldiers near
that town. Money, arms and ammu
nition were taken from them and they
were told to get out of Mexico as
quickly as possible.
Twenty-three Americans were Jeft
at Los Mochis, guarding the big sugar
refinery there, and they have been
given word by Carranza officials that
they will not be molested within twen
ty-four hours after a declaration of
war between the United States and
Mexico, Holton said. The men were
heavily armed. Mexicans around Los
Mochis depend upon the operation of
the refineries for a living.
Mrs. E. E. Watson, aged 65, of New
Yoric City told a story of how, riding
in a caboose attached to a Mexican
Southern Pacific pay train carrying
more than $145,000 in gold, she es
caped possible harm1' from bandits in
a wild ride from Ortiz to Bmpalme.
More refugees will arrive here from
Sallna Cruz and Manzanlllo on the
supply steamer Glacier early next
week.
Many of the refugees landed here
are penniless and they were being
cared for today by the San Diego
chapter of the Red Cross.

Mexican peace conference delegate
now in Washington, according to yes

the southern end of Chihuahua, based

Press Camp In France, July $.—
The total number of prisoners
taken thus far in the Anglo-French
offensive probably has reached 15
000. Judging from these figures,
the German losses as a whole, It Is
estimated here, have been at least
60,000.
The British have taken eleven
guns. The Germans anticipating
the attack withdrew their guns to
longer ranges.
Rome, July 5*—New auceeeses
have been won by the Italians In
their offensive In the Trentino,
the war office announced today.
They have occupied the summit
of Monte Corno, northwest of the
Pasubia, and captured the crest of
Monte SellugJo.
London, July B.—Pressure of the
entente allies on the central powers
continues without abatement and
while nowhere has any great amount
of territory been recovered, great stra
tegic gains are claimed on the west
ern, eastern and Italian fronts. So
far as the western front is concerned,
the first phase of the Anglo-French
offensive is thought to be nearing the
end. Both north and south of the
Somme the French and British are en
gaged-- in organizing positions cap
tured since Saturday. The French,
having taken all the German defen
sive positions south of the Somme,
are now fighting In open country ,and
cavalry, which has been so long Idle,
Is being employed for patrol work.
The next objective of the French in
this region is the village of Barleaux,
which is the Junction point of three
highways leading to the Somme south
of Peronne. If this point is gained
the French will be in position to at
tack the bridgeheads opposite Per
onne, which the Germans are streng
thening.
North of the river the Anglo-French
advance is slower because the Ger
mans have massed between the river
and Hebuterne the bulk of the twenty
six divisions which originally held this
front and the reserves they h^ve
since brought up. After the ground
gained has been concentrated it Is
expected artillery preparations for a
second big thrust will be made.
The Italians, after regaining terri
tory in the Trentino, are going to their
original plan and are attacking along
the lower Iponzo, wliere they have
gained some lesser successes.
Victory for Russians.
Important news comes from Petro
grad. Russian advance guards on
Gen. Letchitzy's extreme left are en
gaged with Austrian rear guards on
the spurs of the Carpathians and un
official reports even say Cossacks
have been raiding Hungary. Gen.
Letchitzy's right has opened a pas
sage in the direction of the stretch
of railway connecting the rear of the
entire Austrian front—Kolomea-Stan
islau-Lemberg—while the occupation
of Deltayn, for which the Russians
are making, would sever the com
munications of Gen. von Bethmer's
army.
Both Field Marshal von Hindenburg
and Field ^Marshal von Mackensen are
reported to have arrived at Kovel to
direct operations designed to break
the Russian arc in Velhynia. The lat
est official dispatches contain claims
by both sides to successes in this re
gion. Press dispatches this morning
emphasize the importance of the Rus
sian victory near Baranovichi where
the latest stroke of Emperor Nichol
as' forces has been delivered.
Meanwhile military activities in
the Balkans are being revived and
successes of the entente allies are re
pdrted to have caused a renewal of
the propagandas of pro-entente poli
ticians in both Greece and Rumania.
REINFORCEMENTS CALLED.
London, July 5.—A Reuter dispatch
from the western front says the Ger
mans made a counter attack on the
new British positions at Thlepvale,
after a heavy bombardment, but were
easily repulsed. Prisoners are quoted
as having stated that German units
are being rushed to the Somme front
from as far as Verdun to the east and
Lens to the north.
According to this dispatch, a Ger
man officer who surrendered 150 men
in a body said he thought they would
be of more use alive In Germany after
the war
than
dead.

REVER8E8 IN BATTLE8.
Berlin, July 5.—Violent fighting be
tween the Germans and entente allies
on both sides of the Somme river has
been continuous since last night, says
today's German official statement. Up
to the present time, the statement
adds, the allies have nowhere obtained
serious advantages.
French troops on the right bank of
the Meuse, in the Verdun sector, re
peatedly tried to advance with strong
forces against the German positions
northwest of Thlaumont works but,
the the statement says, the attempts
were fruitless.
Russian troops are again attacking
the German line,, from Zirin to the
region southeast of Baranovichi, in
Lithuania. Very stubborn hand to
hand fighting is in progress, the an
nouncement adds, and the Russians
have either been repulsed or driven
back from the places where they had
broken into the German lines. The
heaviest losses, it is added, were sus
tained by the Russian*.
FRENCH REPORT GAINS.
Paris, July 5.—The French have cap
tured a line of German trenches east
of Curlu, the war office announced to
day.
They have also captured Sormont
farm, facing Olery.
The advanoe reported indicates that
the French are moving eastward along
the north bank of the Somme river
toward Peronne in the Anglo-French
offensive in Plcardy Clery. The most
advanced point mentioned is four and
one-half miles northwest of Peronne.
The French resumed the offensive
during the night on both sides of the
Somme. South of the Somme they
made further progress toward the
river, particularly at Sormont farm.
This position is on the left bank op
posite Clery. All the region between
the farm and H1U 63 on the road lead
ing from Flaucourt to Barleux Is now
dominated by the French.
After a heavy bombardment the Ger
mans captured part of the village of
Belloy-en-Santerre, but the French
quickly expelled them, taking the1 en
tire village. The Germans still hold
part of the town of Estrees, where
severe fighting Is still in progress.
German attacks on French positions
there were Stopped by the French fire.
The number of prisoners taken thus
far exceeds 9,000. The number of
cannon captured has not been ascer
tained. On the Verdun front heavy
fighting is still in progress. West of
the Meuse the French repulsed a
strong German attack In the region of
Avocourt and Hill 304. East of the
river there was a violent bombard
ment of Thlaumont redoubt and the
Chenois sector.
CASUALTIES ARE LIGHT.
Paris, July 5.—The astonishing fea
ture of the Picardy battle so far as
the French are concerned is the small
loss incurred. Reports thus far show
that one army corps which took a
prominent part lost Just 800 men.
Regiments which took Flaucourt did
not lose a single man. All wounded
brought to Paris hospitals speak of
this extraordinary immunity.
RUMANIANS TALK

London, July 5.—Bucharest dis

GOOD SIZED CHECK
Cash and Pledges From $t
to $100 Some Are Given
in Monthly Payments
Contributions toward the Soldiers'
fund for the aid of those left at home
dependent on the wages of the militia
and bandmen now in camp, took on a
brighter aspect today.
The first thing this morning the
committee was presented with |50 in
cash toward the fund and other
smaller sums have been added in the
past day or two. Much remains to be
done yet by the patriotic people of the
city if they are to supply the aid that
the committee upon investigation says
will be needed. Some help has al
ready been given in urgent cases by
the committee In charge and the
members are deeirons that the fund
grow sufficiently large to provide for
all who will be In need. They say
that soma money will have to be
raised to make up the difference in
the wage of the soldier lads which
was -earned as civilians and what the
government will pay them for army
service. Their families know only too
well the difference and in some cases
it has been felt keenly.
Mayor Carter who is chairman of
the committee, and L. A. Andrew, the
treasurer, will accept any sums that
people care to give toward the .move
ment and any member of the commit
tee will gladly accept sums of money
or pledges for same toward providing
aid for the soldiers' dependents. The
other members of the committee are:
Mrs. F. B. Thrall, Mrs. W. T. Wilson,
221 East Pennsylvania avenue, and
G. F. Spry.
The amounts already received in
money and pledges range from $1, $6,
$10, $15, $60 to $100. The smaller
amounts are pledged monthly as long
as needed or in some case the definite
time the pledge is in force Is stipu
lated by the doner.

Camp Dodge, July 6.—The second
Shipment of clothing destined for sol
diers of the Iowa national guard, it
was announced today, has been ship
ped from the government arsenal at
St Louis and Is due here tomorrow or
Friday. This, it was believed, would
complete the equipment of the Iowa
guard and put them in readiness for
service anywhere. The St Louis
shipment, it was saM, Includes cloth
ing and shoes of which there now Is
a shortage at the camp.
Recruiting of the first cavalry,
which is sail short of the minimum
peace strength due to the refusal of
the troop from West Branch to take
the federal oath, is proceeding slow
ly, according to MaJ. R. P. Howell,
commanding the cavalry. Hope was
virtually abandoned today that the
troop would return. Commercial or
ganisations of the town, on account
of the adverse advertisement given
West Branch, are doing everything In
their power to persuade the men to
come here and take the oath but ef
forts thus tar have been unsuccessful.
It was expected an effort would be
made within a short time to recruit
the required two score men in Des
Moines and neighboring cities.
The guardsmen of the camp re
sumed their routine drills today after
the July 4 holiday. A battalion drill,
with more intricate formations and
longer marches, was on the program
for today. The easy routine was
abandoned and every effort was made
to condition the men for hard service
in (the shortest possible time.
MOUNTED GUN COMPANY.
Muscatine, July 5-—ffhis city may

Capt. W. S. Norton, commanding
officer of the reserve company organ
ized here last week, is in receipt of
word announcing that a mounted ma
chine gun company is to be formed as
an auxiliary of the first Iowa cavalry
and Muscatine is afforded the first
chance to qualify. Fifty of the lately
signed members of the new organisa
tion have already signified a willing
ness to serve in the machine gun
platoon and a meeting has been called
for this evening to bring the company
up to the recruited strength of sixty
five men. The company may entrain
for Camp Dodge before the close of
the week to be mustered In.
Mn8catlne has already oontiiboted
175 men in the artillery section.
MEITltES TD
FEDERAL REPORTS 8HOW8 THAT
THE PRODUCTION 18 NOT UP
TO THE DEMAND.
Washington, D. C., July 5.—High
meat prices probably will continue in
definitely.
This is the conclusion of the depart
ment of agriculture as set forth in an
exhaustive report on the situation
made public today.
High meat prices prevail throughout
the world. One reason is that produc
tion has failed to keep pace with in
crease in population. Other contribu
tory causes given are the increased
cost of production and diminished pur
chasing power of the money unit.
While holding out little or no hope
for a lowering of meat prices in the
near future, the report says that there
probably will be a gradual growth and
expansion in the world's production of
beef, mutton and pork, which may ori
may not equal the rate of increase of
the meat eating population.
The available supply of meat In this
country would be much greater, the
report states, were it not for the enor
mous losses caused by disease and ex
posure. It points out that the United
States still Is not only the greatest
meat eating nation but the greatest
producer.
