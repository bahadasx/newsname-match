Petrograd, July 6, via London, 7:26 p. m. The war of
fice announced toda' the capture of more than 1 0,000
Teutons, of whom 5,000 were taken on the Dniester front.
(
London, July 6, 12:35 p in. Having
captured the whole German second
line south of the Somme from the
river Belloy, the French have resumed
operations north of the river and have
cleared the bank almost ,to Clery

r British Heavily Engaged.
f The British still are heavily engaged
i all along their front from Ilardecourt
to Gommecourt, Notwithstanding
j heavy German counter attacks, they
have been able to maintain all the
! ground gained and extend it at some
points.
j As the German trenches are occu-
i pied, evidence accumulates of the
deadly execution of artillery. In some
cases 80 per cent of the defenders
l were killed by the terrific shelling to
1 which they were subjected. British
losses vary. Certain formations be-
I Ing called on to attack defenses where
machine guns remained undamaged
suffered heavily. Others captured the
positions which had been set as their
Objective with very slight losses.
Instead of compelling the Germans
to lesen their efforts at Verdun, the
Anglo-French offensive seems to have
Increased their determination, possib
ly in the hope of preventing the
fi French from sending reinforcements
to the Somme. British observers ex
press satisfaction with the progress
which has been made. With the
heavy casualties caused by the bom
bardment and the taking of 1G.000
prisoners and a great quantity of war
material, together with the subsequent
losses inflicted in counter attacks, it
is believed here that the German pow
er of resistance must have been weak
ened. Russians Still Gaining.
The Russians continue to record
successes, some of which are of great
Importance, along their whole front
from Riga to the Carpathians The
have crossed the Tallway between
Delaytn, west of Kolomea, and Koros
mezo, one of the main linos between
Galicia and Hungary upon which toe
Austrlans depend largely to supply
their armies at Stanislau and before
Tarnopol. This places the array
General von Bothmer in a still more
dangerous position and it Is thought
ho may decide to withdraw toward
Lemberg. ,,t,i
In the Lutsk salient, at Baranovichi,
and along the Riga front the Russians
f also claim to be making progress and
' to have repulsed counter attacks.
German correspondents express the
' ovinion that General Kuropatkln .Is
preparing an offensive In the Vilna

u 1 1 All 1 1 nuUKtuu
All Counter Attacks Repulsed
and Large Area of New
Territory Occupied.
LOSSES ARE LIGHT
German Officers Saving Men
for War Germany Is to
Wage Four Years
Hence.
Paris, July 6, 12:23 p. m. The
French offensive has made steady
progress. In the last 24 hours. All
counter attacks have been repulsed,
a large area of new territory has
been occupied and extensive captures
of guns and munitions have been
made.
In the first five days of their bat
tle against the Germans the French
have advanced with remarkable unl
lormlty. The ground gained varied
each day in depth at different points,
but the gains have averaged about the
same along the entire front, and the
French are now firmly installed be
tween the second and third lines of
defense over a front In excess of seven
miles.
French Losses Light.
That the French losses have been
comparatively insignificant is indicat
ed by the maintenance on the front
line of attack at their own request at
the same time of army corps that
made the first assault on German
positions last Saturday morning. One
of these corps distinguished itself bo
fore Verdun in February after having
won laurels in the battle of the Marne
and at all parts of the front whore
there have been heavy fighting. The
other corps comprises chiefly colonial
troops. The generals commanding
each corps were again congratulated
yesterday by General Forach.
Not all the divisions of these two
corps have been actually in action, but
basing the calculations upon 9,000 men
made prisoners by these troops, the
French clearly appear to have suf
fered only slightly in comparison with
the forces with which they were en
gaged. Efficiency of Heavy Artillery .
This result is attributed by German
prisoners to the efficiency of the
French heavy artillery.
"The officers uuanimously decided
to surrender to avoid useless sacrifico
of life," said an officer taken prisoner
yesterdny. "What we have to do now
is to save men for the coming vic
torious war which Germnny will wage
four years hence."
French in Front of Peronne.
The new French trenches at the
most advanced point are now in front
c
of Peronne and the village of Mount
St. Quentin, situated on an elevation
300 feet from the point from which,
in 1S70 the Germans bombarded Pe
ronne. The Germans' second positions had
been so demolished by artillery that
they were unable to make a strong
resistance except at the village of
Hem, which had been strongly forti
fied. Hero the attacking troops met
desperate opposition. By dint of hard
lighting the village was won as well
as Monacou farm to the southwest.
Hard Fight Expected.
The Germans are beginning to react
more vigorously as reserves arrive,
particularly south of the Somme and
the French advance there Is hotly con
tested. French critics expect that the
Germans will concentrate all their en.
ergles In defense of the villages of
Barleaux and Vlllers Carbonuel
which bar the way to Peronne.

Washington, July 6. Formal ac

posal that differences between the
United States and the de facto govern
ment of Mexico be settled by direct
negotiations will bo dispatched soon
to Mexico. This was decided by Presi
dent Wilson today at a conference
with Secretary Lansing
The Mexican note delivered yester
day said the defacto government had
accepted in principle Latin-American
offers of mediation but was awaiting
information as to whether the United
States believed the desired results
could be accomplished by direct ex
changes between the two govern
ments Secretary Lansing will leave tomor
row for a month's vacation. It was
not stated today whether he would
prepare the reply to Mexico beforo
his departure but indications are th.it
it will go forward within a day or two
at most
Officers Unable to Predict.
While General Carranza's amicable
rejoinder to the last two American
notes haB greatly eased tension no
official was willing today to predict
the 'final outcome of the negotiations
which are foreshadowed.
It was made plain that immediate
withdrawal of General Pershing's
force from Mexico will not be an ac
ceptable basis for whatever plan of
co-operative action along the border
is worked out.
Must Demonstrate Ability.
Washington officials take the posi
tion that onlv tho preliminary step
has been taken by Goneral Carrauza
toward the friendly adjustment, ho
now appears to desire. Demonstration
of his ability to carry out the vromises
expressed and implied in his note is
still lacking.
The efficiency of Mexican police i
measures may be put soon to a severe
test according to rumors transmitted
from the border today to the state de
partment. These state that Francisco
Villa has recovered from his wounds
and is personally leading a force
northward from the region just south
of Parral.
Eliseo Arredondo, the Mexican ambassador-designate,
made an engage
ment for a conference with Secretary
Lansing late today It was intimated
at the stale department that the re
sponse to Carranza's note probably
would be sent tomorrow
A cablegram from Mexico City, re
ceived at the Mexican embassy today,
said that General Pablo Gonzales had
reported that Morelos has been clear
ed of Zapata followers and that the
rebels formerly in arms against Car
ranza received amnesty by the thous
ands. Mexicans Avoiding Clash.
Efforts of Mexican authorities on
tho west coast to prevent incidents
which might strain relations with t he
UnitPd States were reported to the
navv department by Admiral Wlnslow,
commander of tho Pacitic fleet.
As an example the admiral describ
ed an incident at Guaymas. where . dif
ficulty with the Mexican port officials
threatened because a boat from the
destroyer Hopkins stopped a Mexican
schooner to ascertain whether she
carried supplies expected by Ameri
cans living in Guaymas men the
commander of the cruiser Cleveland,
ranking American naval officer in
port explained that the boat crow had
misunderstood its orders, the Mexican
commander sent a friendly note ex
pressing his satisfaction at the action.

Instructed bv tho war department to

Washington, July 5.' After a con
ference with President Wilson at the
