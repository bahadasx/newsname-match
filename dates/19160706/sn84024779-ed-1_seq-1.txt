A SPLENDID PROPOSITION
For the Citizens Who Have Not
Signed Petition to Do Some
Thing for the Boys
A committee of three, consist
ing of Messrs. W. E. Pureell, C. E.
Lounsbury and C, J. KachelliolT
er started tlie ball a rolling for
Company I when they took a peti
tion among the citizens for a
monthly good-will offering for the
boys of Company 1. The citizens
responded nobly and this fund
will be used as Captain Thomsen
sees fit in providing extra delica
cies for the table, or small arti
cles of equipment".
""At the present lime $150 a
month has been raised for the
boys. If you haven't signed the
petition, and want to show your
loyalty to the home boys you can
do so. The money will be kept on
deposit at the Peoples National
Bank.
A number of the young men of
the city gave a big dance at the
Armory Friday evening, the pro
ceeds of which amounting to
$100.00 will go into this fund. It
was a very hot night, and the
boys are to be congratulated on
their success. The music was fur
nished at a reduced rate, in view
of the purpose of the dance, and
the committee kept the expenses
down as low as possible.
A citizen committee consisting
of Messrs. Robt. T. Barber, W. A.
Farnsworth and F. B. Schneller
will have the management of the
Armory building during the ab
sence of Captain Thomsen and
Company I. All requests for the
use of this building should be
addressed to this committee.

SCREENINGS HAVE FOOD VALUE
The per rent screenings In
North Dakota wln-at for the years
1907 to 1915 was .nearly per
cent, according to Bulletin 11 by
Professor E. F. Ladd. If the
1915 wheal crop contained (his
average per cent of screenings,
it would amount to 171,338 tons
of file equivalent of 5 1-2 million
bushels of wheat. The average
of the analysis of these screen
ings showed (hem to be rich in
food value. There is a good deal
of varation in the composition of
secreenings depending on the
kinds of seeds that they contain.
Sheep are very fond of screen
ings and they are the only live
stock that it is safe to feed the
screenings to without grinding.

The Heavy Storms in the Past
Week Have Caused Waters
in the Red River
TO A RAISE OF EIGHT FEET
But Yesterday Afternoon They
Were Slowly Receding and
Will Soon be Normal
The heavy storms in the past
week have caused the waters in
the Red River and its auxiliary
rivers, the otlertail and Bois de
Sioux to leave their banks and
flood the lowlands all along- the
three rivers.
Many fields of grain were de
stroyed andpaslures and hay land
under water so deep that cattle
and horses arc unable to walk in
them.
Island Park is coveerd by wat
er with a depth of three feet and
it has been a most enjoyable spot
for bathers.
Hot suns prevail when it is not
raining and many farmers are
jvorry that should their grain pull
hrough the heavy rains, th* hot
mil will cause, their crops to be
scalded.
