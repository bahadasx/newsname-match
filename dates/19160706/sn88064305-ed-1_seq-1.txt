Washington llonors A' The
State Normal.
A per.sonal letter from Mr. II,
C. Cooley Ph. D., head of the
department of Prwlabury at the
State No, mal gives a hiihly grati
fying report of the Washington
Parish students at Natchitoches.
Mr. Cooley writes that while all
of our representatives are doing
commendable work, there are
two who have won signal honors
and because we are sure the
whole parish will take pride in
the success of these boys we take
pleasure in repeating in our col.
umns just what Mr. Cooley says:
"You will be pleased to know
that two Washington Parish boys
have gained signal honors. Ezra
Corkern was elected faculty rep
resentative of his graduating
class for the exercises August 8th.
This the highest honor in school
each term. Mr. Corkern has led
the school in scholarship several
terms. He was one of the busi
ness managers of the Annual Pot
pourri and is on the Current
Sauce staff.
Today Murphy J. Sylvest was
elected Student Body President.
He is Editor-in-Chief of Current
Sauce, is on the Male Quartette,
and represented the school as
orator at the Intercollegiate
Meet in Alexandria recently.
Mr. R. J. Kemp, also of Wash
ington, graduates in August. He
is a man of sterling qualities.
His knowledge of dairying has
not only made him money here,
but fame as a butter-maker."
Former Parish Supt. J. W.
Bateman is at Natechitoohes and
always shows a keen interest in a
all students from this parish, and d
we would be glad to know of a
number of earnest boys and girls
from Washington entering the
Staate Normal next session with
thedetermination to creditably z
fill the ranks left vacant by the
promotion or graduation of the
presenl band of students there of t
whom we feel so justly proud.
Duma Passes Bill To Bar $
Vodka Forever.
Petrograd, June 30, via London c
-The Duma today passed the f
billpermanently prohibiting the
sale of drink containing more
than one and one-half per cent of
alcohol. The measure must be
prassed by the upper House and
signed by the emperor before be
coming a law.
According to the terms of the
bill, strong drink means any
liquor containing more than 1 1-2
per cent alcohol and, therefore,
includes light wines and beer.
Amendments proposing a change
in the definition of alcohol were
summarily rejected by the Duma,
and the bill was passed in its ex
acset form as drawn up by the com.
mittee.
Passage of the bill by the up.
per house and its approval by the
emperor would mean that all
Russisa will become a strict pro
hibition country.

J. Vol Brock.
There is no more popular offi
cial in Washington Parish than
J. Vol Brock the capable district
attorney of this, the 26th judicial
district. Mr. Brock has served
this district for the past four
years and could have been thops
ands of dollars better off had he
done as many district attorneys
do, but Mr. Brock felt that he
would rather have the law en
forced, be a friend to all instead
of getting every dollar he could,
This is best shown by the fact
that in a majority of cases tried
in the city court of Bogalusa that
the convicted could be charged
with the same offenses under the
state law. Heretofore unless the
crime has been a serious one Mr,
Brook would not have the state
oases tried, after investigating the
facts and finding that the city
fine would answer the same pur
pose, However in eaoh case he
loses $20. Mr. Brook's record
during the present term is-one- of
which any official would feel
proud, His friends believe that
if for no other reason he is en
titled to re-election it should be
on his record am District Attor
ney. Mr. Brock is one of the
most affable gentlemen in Wash
ington Parish and the experience
he has had during the past four
years will assist him during the
next term to make even a better
official, He has never been
charged with playing politics,
having proscuted some of his
very best friends.
Washington Parish expects to
roll up a big majority in favor of
Mr. Brock at the coming pri
mary.-Bogalusa Enterprise.
Charles E. Hughes planued to
open his active campaign in Au
gust with a transcontinental trip.
Enterprise, Miss., mourned the
death of three sisters, aged 20,
16 and 11, accidentally drowned
in Chunkey river.
