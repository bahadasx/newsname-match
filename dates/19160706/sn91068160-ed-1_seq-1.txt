Diplomatic Negotiations With
Mexico Will Now Be Resumed
Washington, July 5. Early resump
tion of friendly diplomatic conversa
tions with the de facto government of
Mexico to the end that peace and order
may be restored in, northern Mexico
and along the border is expected here
to be the next step of the United States
Jn its relations with its southern nefgh
tor.
The crisis precipitated by Villa's
raid on Columbus, 1$. M., and culminat
mz in the right at Carrizal, Mex., be
tween American and Mexican troops,
appeared tonight to have been dissipa-tt-d
by an amicable note from General
Carranza, presented during the day by
us ambassador-designate here.
TLr-! note proposes that the differ
ences between the governments be set-
-t'u uy mediation or by direct negotia-t'011--
H is remarkable for its brevity,
its J 'oi rained and friendly tone and
r the absolute lack of any of the
-trong, even insolent language which
characterized the last two communication.-;
from the di facto government.
!t treats as a closed incident the ex
thange of unfriendly communications
wnieu brought war almost within,
sight.
-No Formal Comment.
ao formal comment on the note was
jainahJe from state department offi
A copy was forwarded to the
Tv"hite house immediately upon its re
and President Wilson will deter
niJne the course to be pursued. Sec
retary Lansing today completed his
ijr -Puraiions for a month's vacation,
Jo begin Friday, and this is believed
to indicate a feeling tn his part that
the cri.sis is over.
As a matter of general principle,
, Washington government always
tavored mediation of any dispute suit
abie f0r Sucn procedure.
A here is every ' indication, however,
that in the present instance it will be
denied desirable to conduct forth
coming negotiations directly with the
ai ranza government. -Members
of the Latin-American
miomatic corps here are expected to
rakc- inquiry soon as to the attitude
the Washington government, in
' w of the statement of the Mexican
'gn office that it awaits only a,de
cion here as to whether mediation or
ujrect negotiations would be prefera

May ?ot Keply.
It is not known whether a formal
reply to General Carranza's note is
contemplated. Diplomatic usage does
not call for one, and many officials
feel that more can be accomplished
through informal discussion between
Mr. Arredondo and Counsellor Pork, '
who will act as secretary in Mr.
Lansing's absence. It is understood ;
Mr. Arredondo plans to call at the j
department to sav goodbye to Secre-
tary Lansing before the latter's de
, parture. Probably the, preliminary
of the informal discussion will be
taken then.

PAYS SEMITAUAL DIVIDES!)
On July first the Citizens National
Bank distributed it3 usual semi-an-'
nual dividend of 4 per cent, to it3
stockholders. The old Citizens Bank
which bequeathed its business and
reputation to the Citizens National
paid its stockholders a regular semi
annual dividend from the time of it3
organization and accummulated a
handsome surplus. The Citizens Na
tional bids fair to exceed the record
made by its predecessors. as the pub
lished statements of the bank show
Eteady, rapid and continuous-growth
in .the' volume of business handled,
through it. Henderson county is for
tunate in having an institution of such
high-class and substantial standing to
aid the development of its extensive
resources.
FIKST BANK DECLAKES A
THREE PER CENT DIVIDEND.
The board of directors of the First
Bank and Tru3t company have de
clared the usual semi-annual dividend j

i ! j ' t Boyd after the revenue man had been
. A happy day to the promoters-was tilled lo-th ground by the brawny
realized July. 4th at Chimney Rock j mountaineer.; As the agent fell he
when Old Glory", wag hoisted and- a jdrew his-gunand the first shot brought
large crowd Journeyed thither to iwit- Gregg tumbling down the steep moun
ness the ceremonies attendant. The tain sidet to -his feet '
dreams,, the visions, the plans, .the
work that led up to . the proud hour
makes a story well worth reading.
The whole Chimney Rock section is a
wild,' rugged country which has been
almost totally inaccessible to vehicles
o; any kind until the last few years
v.hen a splendid highway has been
built across it which is daily travers
ed,' in summer,, by hundreds of automo
biles carrying throngs of visitors to
fidmire the wonderful and awe-inspir-ng
scenery. The chlefest of the won
ders of the section
is the Chimney
a huge mass of
Rock itself which is
solid rock. 230 feet from base to sum-
mit, and can not be described with
ad-
jectives or measured by line and which
rises majestically in chimney-like
proudness, over many, towering peaks.
It has teen visited every year by
thousands of visitors who had to weary
body and limb in a hard climb and pull
to reach its top- and be able to say,
boastingly, "I "climbed Chimney Rock
and beheld the wonders of God." In
recent years the Morse brothers Dr.
L. B. Morse, of Hendersonville, H. B.
Morse, of St. Loui3 and A. E. Morse,
of Kansas City became the owners of ,
the greatest stretch of rock, ledge and
rugged grandeur and a vision was
caught of the possibility of the reali
zation of the dreams of Jerome B.
Freeman, the former owner of the
property. Plans were made and work
was begun a few months ago on a
road to lead from the highway in the
valley of Broad river right up
to the base of the rock. The survey of
this road is the work of a master hand
and is a marvel to all visitors. The
road is three miles in length and
winds in and out and around, ever up
ward with an average grade ef only
1 , a 2 grade being maintained on
all "hair pin" curves. The 'entire
road is a double track and at all switch
back curves a 75 ft width is given. At
the end of the i road which is at the
very base of the "Chimney" i3 a park
ing place which will accommodate
many cars and which was at no time
taxed at the opening on July 4th, even
with the 1,000 or more people who
visited the top of the Rock on that
date.
It was most fitting that the comple
tion of this wonderful road should be
celebrated on July 4th, the day vhen
all true Americans love to show pride
in their country and its developments.
A4 exactly 1:20 o'clock the immense
flag. 25x15 feet, of star? and stripes
was" hoisted to the top of a 60 foot
pole and "Old Glory" was stetched
out in the air by the mountanis' never
dying breezes amidst the reverent
cheering of the thrones and the rever
berations of the mountains. To Mr.
Jerome Freeman, a veteran of pro
gress, born under the shadow of the
Rock, first owner, and who first con
ceived the idea that such a road could
te built, was accorded the honor of
raising the flag. In his speech which
followed he expressed his pleasure
that he had lived to the glad day when
his dreams of many years had been
fulfilled and he could not find words
to describe hi3 happiness. Short pa
triotic speeches were then made by
J, S. Sumner of Asheville. L. J. Led
better of Bat Cave arid B. H. DePriest
of Shelby. The Hendersonville band
closed the exercises with "My Country.
'Tis of Thee" and the crowds adjourn
ed to picnic dinners in groups over
the mountain sides. The remainder of
the day was spent in visiting the bot
tomless pools, the cave, the Appian
Way wlich is a cut out, way m the
face of a solid rock leading to the head
of a falls many hundred feet high and
other places of interest.
Fire works from the top of Chimney
Rock and dances at the leading hotels
were the closing features of the day.

built man, but nervy, leaped after him.
The moonshiner grappled with , the
revenue man. The struggle was des
perate, but short, for soon the burly
mountaineer had worked the smaller
man around in front of him, and with
a blow behind the ear had sent kim
sprawling down the side of the moun
tain.
But almost before he had struck
the ground for the last time the agent
had drawn and fired. The bullet found
its mark,; and Gregg tumbled after
his captor. He was unable' to walk
to the waiting automobile which had
brought the revenue, men from Ashe
ville to the foot of the mountain where
they discovered the still so a stretcher
was improvised .'of hickory poles and
old tow sacks, and with much -labor
he was brought out of the mountain
to the motor car. With him was
brought his father, seventy-nine years
old.
More serious to the suffering block
ader, however, than his wound, and
the possible consequences of violating
the revenue laws- of his country, was
the welfare of his aged father. He in
Ristentlv heerered last nieht that the
old man be not placed in jail, and
piteously cried again and again that
if such should be his fate it would
kill him. He is a burly, well built
man, as the slighter revenue agent
who' attempted his capture single
handed is well aware, and his sincere
concern over the welfare of his father
was a touch of affection for which the
revenue agents were quite unprepared.
The capture was made in an ex
tremely wild and rugged part of, Polk
county. It is supposed the jstill had
been in operation for a considerable
time, and its product disposed of at
no great distance from where it was
located.
Captured Two That Day.
In addition to the above still the
officers Tuesday captured a big 118
gallon outfit near-the new bridge be

The still, as stated, was of a 118-gal-lon
capacity, and -14 fementers were
also destroyed. The second outfit
wag located about 3 miles beyond the
point where the first one. was found
and about 1 1-2 miles from Saluad.
It had a capacity of 110 gallons. This
was the place w,here Gregg was shot.
