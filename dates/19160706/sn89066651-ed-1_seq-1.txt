HAYTI, MISSOURI, THjLTHSDAY, JULY 6, 1916.
NO. 34.
MISSOURI MILITIA. ,
By Herald Correspondent.
July 1. Perhaps tho people of
Pemiscot county would bo glad
to hear that Co. "B" of the Itli
Regiment will loavo for the bol
der soon. The Company took an
other vaccination for small pox
today, which leave two more vac
einations yet to take. Tho boys
are all well and seem to be mix
ious to move.
The 1st Kcgiment left out last
night, Battery B leaving today.
The Company is being equipped
today with shoes and clothing.
Owing to the vaccinations the
Company has not been drilling
the last few days. All have sore
arms now. '
Company "B" will be rcpre
rented on the mounted scouts by
Privates John L. Shepard, J. W.
Terrell and 11. L. Jones, they be
ing transferred to that com maud.
The boys put in the morning
reading the Argus and a letter
appearing in same from Nevada.
It stated to the people at home
that we had nothing to eat. The
writer of that letter had her in-,
formation from some raw re j
cruits that thought a soldier ,
should be fed like a 13 a day
house would feed them. We get '
plenty of good, solid food. The
trouble was that the Quartermas
ter Sergeant drew rations for a
certain number of men, then the,
new recruits came in, that caus-1
ing a shortage of rations. But!
only a few kicked at' that. Ca j
riithersvllle-came -across'with
$r0, so the boys will have nomu
extras for awhile. The boys cer-'
tainly appreciated the donation,
too.
July U. Company "B"and the
4th Regiment entrains today, the
third, for the border, after sever
al days work. The Regiment is
ready to go, the officers being
busy preparing. Every mem
ber of the Company are anxious
to move.
As to the boys rejected, they
will return homo. Owing to the
situation they seem worried as
to which way they would like to
go. Sergeant Gamble and Pri
vate Oscar Dickson were ilis
charged owing to the expiration
of term but will enlist after
the second examinaton. Capt.
Reeves and Lieut Mallourc
passed. The company fell short
at roll call they being Private
James Wilson and Claudio Clay,
as that is the talk in camp.
I The Company is well equipped
and ranks among tho bust of the
1th Regiment.
The boys send their best re
gard to the people ol Pemiscot
county, and arc hoping they will
leturn someday. While thu par
ents, sisters and swuuthcarts
are spending the lth in enjoy
ment, the boys will be speeding
for tho Mexican border.
It is not exactly known just
where the Regiment will bo sent,
although it is thought to Laredo,
Texas.
ON THE ROAD, July I, Par
sons, Kans. It is now throe
o'clock in the afternoon and the
lth Missouri Regiment is en
trained for some point on the
Mexican border over the M. K. &
T., witli 21 cars carrying 1013
num., the 4th Regiment being
tho largest regiment of the Mis
souri Guard. Everyone seem
happy alter laying all clay in the
&un at Nevada -waiting for the
cars to move us, it being a very
disagreeable fourth for our regi
ment, i
While we were in readiness to
move the mail was being deliv-'
ered, every person who received
a communication feeling the j
happiest. After the reading of
letters everything was very quite
lor awhile. Later the boys would
often mention the lth of July
celebration at home and how we
are now doing our celebrating,
but with a slight remark th.it
there was.-yiother time- --
The rejected boys left yester
day for their homes in dear old
Pemiscot county and other points
in Missouri.
Capt. Reeves has received
much praise from tho head oftl
cers for holding up the Hag in
Southeast Missouri. After the
rejects of Co. "B" left the Com
pany has 09 men, with 2 de
serters. Several of the company
has been on the sick list, Lieut.
W. B. Hitchcock and Privates
Newberry and Evans.
As we are speeding along the!
farmers in this country are work-'
ing in the wheat fields.
Wo hope tho lady that wrote to I
Pemiscot county that we were
starving will learn bettor some
time. The second vaccination is
taking hold and the boys of the
company are complaining of
the soreness of arms. Those re
jected boys were hurt, as some
of thoin wanted to follow the '
command, while others were .
glad to get loose on the second '
examination. i

Sitting George Siglcr, director, Isaiah Far is,

Tho pupils of the Hayti Public School have for
three years had a savings bank. The officers are
elected annually by the students. Deposit are
allowed from a penny up. One hour, from '.) to 10
a. in. each day is banking time. The bank then
closes for business at tho school and the cashier
takes the funds, properly .credited, goes to the
Banl: of Hayti and makes deposit. The plan has
proven a grand success, having not only taught
the smaller childi en to save, but the older ones
also. The deposits run higher each year and in
crease in number. At tho end of the year depos
itors may receive their money, and the savings of
many pupils run up to magnificent sums. The
cashier and deputies alternate weekly in render
ing their service.
WIFE SHOOTS HUSBAND.
An almost fatal tragedy oc
curred just south of this city
Thursday night of last week,
when W. W. Parks, a wealthy
farmer, who had, it is under
stood, spent the day in this city,
land during the time had drank
considerably, afterwards return
ing home. Upon his return home
a quarrel ensued between him
self and wife and in which it is
said ho abused or struck his wife.
Several reports have circulated,
but the most authentic is that
lie had threatened her life, that
she broke away and barricaded
herself in a room. He then tried
to go in at a window and she
opened tire on him with a 3:2
calibre revolver, tiring one shot
that took serious effect just below
the left lung, passing entirely
through his body.
After the tragedy Mr. Parks
was taken to Caruthersville to
' the home of his mother, and in
the morning to a hospital in
.Memphis, Tenn.
At the request of his wife, who
did the shooting, he, accompanied
by Dr. Goo. Phipps and O. R.
Cole, left on the accommodation
train for Memphis. We under
stand that Mr. Parks has ex
onerated his wife, stating that
he "made her do it," and we
hope that he may soon return
from the hospital a well man,
however, the doctors at first re
ported a very slight chance for
recovery.
At the time of going to press
we understand that he is resting
very well and that If no compli
cations set about he has a chance
for recovery.

It has no doubt been apparent to you
for more than a year past that the price
of all articles of merchandise through
this country has had a rising tendency. It
is unnecessary to search for the reason
why this is true, or to attempt to specu
late upon how long such a condition may
last. The fact is that costs in the great
basic industries of manufacture have had
an almost startling rise. This has per
haps been more apparent in the leather
and shoe trades than in any other line.
More than a fourth of the leather used in
the manufacture of mediun price and
cheap shoes has gone abroad and costs
have advanced from 00 per cent to 100
per cent. Our Company are large pur
chasers of leather, large manufacturers,
and can and will maintain our unheard
of low prices. Come and investigate.
Look for more leather news ne,l week.

TEXAS FORGER CAUGHT.
Bennie Chancy, alias Harry
Hall, Harry Mayes, and probably
other names, of Colo, Texas, was
captured in this city Thursday
night of last week by City Mar
shal Robertson.
It is said by authorities that
Chancy is an ex-convict, and had
escaped. He was wanted by the
state of Texas for forgery, and
was serving a two year term in
the Texas penitentiary.
Several days ago Mr. Robert
sou received a card stating that
it was believed that this party
was in Hayti. He replied asking
that a description of the man
wanted be sent him. Mr. Rob
ertson states that as soon as the
description was received he knew
exactly who was who, and imme
diately lodged the victim.
After the arrest the young
man acknowledged that he was
the wanted person and that his
name was Bennie Chancy, but
that at first he had almost
forgotten his real name, that he
had gone under the alias names
so long. He had been in this
city several months and was a
neat dresser and was supposed
to be a gambler.
He was lodged in the city jail
the night of the arrest and a
guard placed near for safe keep
ing. During the night some of
the citizens(?) of this city at
tempted to aid him to escape,
though it was prevented
The proper authorities were
notified and they came and took
him away Saturday.
Thus, Mr. Robertson is now
$25 better off, this being the
reward offered.
