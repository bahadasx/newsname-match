there is good sport anticipated.
THE HONOR ROLL.
The Mexican volcano is now in
the most serious eruption that has
ever been developed yet.
Tho United States government
has shown its utmost patience and
leniency in dealing with that un
fortuiiate country, cursed as it has
been with selfish, grafting and in
competent rulers. The limit of
our patience has been reached and
it would seem that the avoidance
of war is well nigh impossible. In
1898, the peace-loving McKinley
had confidently hoped to avoid a
war with Spain until the battle
ship Main was blown up, and after
that event, ho entertained but the
slightest hope that war could be
avoided between the two countries.
Tho attack last week on a small
detachment of General Pershing's
forces, is very likely to result in
rendering war inevitable, just as
the blowing up of the battleship
Maine did in 1898,
As every well informed person
knows Mexico has no munition
factories of any consequence, nor
has she the skilled Avorkmen with
which to either construct or oper
ate them, and as all of her arms
have been obtained from this
country, which have now been cut
off, and as our navy can easily
blockade her coast, it will be seen
that Mexico would be entirely at
our mercy.
But war with Mexico may mean
more than now appears. Regard
less of her seemingly helpless con
dition, there may be other sources
of supply for munitions and to
gether with conditions of the
country and the guerilla methods
of warfare of her fighters, war
with Mexico will not by any
means be a game of ping pong.

tended by a large delegation, the
mnjority of whom were ladies.
Vice Pres. Dr. Rheinfrank pre
sided. Tho ladies stated that they
would not organize an auxiliary
but would participate in the regu
lar organization which announce
ment was received with applause
of approval by the men.
In order that everybody in town
might he given an opportunity to
share in the expense of the coining
Centennial celebration the ladies
were invited to take up tho matter
of soliciting subscriptions to the
funds and they promptly accepted
the arduous responsibility and
chose Mrs. Wm. Mills as the treas
urer. The question of participating in
the Toledo Preparade received but
little encouragement and was fin
ally dropped.

Assured by Indorsement of Hughes
By Bull Moosers.
Tho indorsement of Mr. Hughes
by the Bull-Moosers has now made
Republican success practically cer
tain. It is very likely that Mr.
Hughes will poll about 90 per cent
of the Progressive votes which Mr.
Roosevelt received in 1912. This
would mean the addition of about
3,700,000 votes to the Republican
ticket which renders tho success of
tho Republican ticket almost be
yond doubt.
President Wilson's habit of writ
ing notes to foreign countries in
stead of maintaining a vigorous
foreign policy, as was the case
when we had such Secretaries of
State as Root, Knox and Hay; has
so disgusted the country, that
every thoughtful American citizen
is eagerly looking forward to the
time when our foreign affairs will
again command the respect and
fear of the civilized world as it did
in the good old days when the Re
publican party ruled tho country.
VILLA CURRENCY
Mr. Pierce Norton has sent to
the editor of the Jouunl a hand
ful of Villista currency issued in
1915, of which Pierce says :
"Villa says this is as good
money as anyone ever made."
Sorry we can't use the stuff,
but it does seem good for a coun
try editor to have so much money
all at one time. It has such a rich
"feel" to it.
TRAVELING MAN'S EXPERIENCE
"In the summer of 1888 I had a very
severe attack of cholera morbus. Two
physicians worked over me from our
a. m. to 6 p. m. without giving me any
relief and then told me they did not
expect me to live; that I had best tele
graph for my family. Instead of do
ing so, I gave the hotel porter fifty
cents and told him to buy me a bottle
of Chamberlain's Colic, Cholera and
Diarrhoea Remedy, and take no sub
stitute. I took a double dose according
to the directions and went to sleep
after the second dose. At five o'clock
the next morning I was called by my
order and took a train for my next
stopping point, a well man but feeling
rather shaky from the severity of the
attack," writes H. W. Ireland, Louis
ville, Ky. For sale by all dealers.
U. S. ARMORED CARS.
Armored automobiles cradled
on the decks of warships, in sea
going rafts, for use of detach
ments of the United States Marino
Corps in shore operations, may
soon be added to the regular
equipment of naval vessels.
Experiments at the Boston navy
yard a few days ago demonstrated
that these indispensable cars can
be stowed aboard by the means of
electric cranes on war vessels, in
a very few moments, and that the
deck space they occupy is very
little.
United States Marines found
great need for armored cars in'
their recent operations in Mexico,
Hayti and Santo Domingo, but tho
cars they used had to bo shipped
to them by regular naval transports.
Will Sloan's Liniment Relieve Pain?,
Try it and see ono application will
prove more than a column of claims.
James S. Ferguson, Phila., Pa., writes:
"I have had wonderful relief since I
used Sloan's Liniment on my knees. To
think after all these years of pain one
application gave me relief. Many
thanks for what your remedy has done
for me." Don't keep on suffering, ap
ply Sioan's Liniment where your pain
is and notice how quick you get relief.
