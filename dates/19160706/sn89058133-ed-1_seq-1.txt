was published several years ago In the
White County Favorite, and is printed
in the Herald at 'the request of Rev.
M. Judd, of Cookevilie, Tenn., Route 2,

start a movement for a decoration and

which the veterans of the Civil war
might participate, both blue and gray.
There was once a place In '.White
county known as the Green Bottom. It
was the home of Robert Cooke, Esq.,
who had been a Revolutionary soldier.
His home was located with a land war
rant, and his , land was cleared and
fenced with slave labor. At that time
