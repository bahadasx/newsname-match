"How it Happened it Not Known."
Shouts of Aye we shall meet at
Phillipi and lay on MucDufT cm
mannting from the vanuiird of
the Circuit Riders sounded and re
sounded in Friday's breeze in the
neighborhood of Proctor's park
that is going out to the park a
comedy of errors by Bill Shake
speare of Francis Bacon take your
choice very aptly describes the
resulting fracas. Worthy reader it
is physical impossibility to give
you ull of the details of the game.
We have it from his very august
and reticent majesty his umps
Mr. Grimm that the playing wqs
wild, weird and woozy and he
might have added wobbly. The
niost clever paly of the afternoon oc
curred in the seventh inning when
medical Brother Guilford retired in
good order there by showing intel
ligence of the highest order and
making a diagnosis by exclusion
prognosis favorable. Wm Griffith
obviously not related to Clark
made five errors out of five chances
and thereby did his bit. We have
long since forgotten what lone Cir
cuit Rider made the round of the
Circuit in Friday's game but we
think he was very Sharp. Yea
Bo its hot in Monroe. Hades and
still worse in Hannibal, but the
afore mentioned are places refriger
ators compared to the surface un
der Brother Hoy's E &. W. Like the
classic mentor of Base Ball
Connie Mark, the good pastor is
contemplating something and men
put up your weather ears to get
their inside box office stuff. He is
thinking of holding mourning (no
Igna'.z not mourning) practice for
his aggregation, the idea being
heartily endorsed by ye scribe and
others. One or two of Rev. Hoy's
helpfuls are well known for their
high Epworth League rating, but in
the B. B. League when it comes to
poling the horse hide they are like
the Kaiser at Verdun. Oh "Yes"
in conclusion, it was rumored
that the final count, after artillery,
curtain and screen fire of the
Hardshells had passed stood at 22
to 1 in their favor. Tis lucky for
the Circuit Riders that the under
signed is a neutral.
The Observer.
Notes of the game.
Mr. Perrival Lasley was there
so to speak, nt least we. heard his
voice
Doc Guildford has a broad sense
of humor and it was never shown
to better advantage then when he
called to Griffith in the 4th inning,
"Base balls don't stick as well as
bucks in your hands." Burks -Iron
men dollars, coin of tho realm
etc Willie's answer has not
reached us as yet.
The new Grant (I was at the
game much to the delight of Mr. P.
Lesley. He could crowd into the
repair box in the event of a bum
decision.
Car Turned Turtle
As six Shelbina boys were pass
ing the Chas. Lewis farm on the
State Highway Tuesday night their
carweut down an eubankment and
turned over on the occupants.
All escaped with bruises, only one,
Marshall Crawford, was very much
hurt. He thought his arm was
dislocated und went to Dr. Turner
who, after an examination said be
was only bruised. The car belong
ed to the Collins livery barn and a
Collins boy was driving. They hud
been to Hannibal
Mtn's Pxlm Beach Suits, the
kind you will like this hot weather.

by unrolling them and reading a
little verse enclosed Jane Guil
ford sang a solo as Goddess of
Liberty, which was very appropri

given by Frances Willard entitled
i'The Temperance Hag," and one
