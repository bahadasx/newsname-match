/Hasn't the state supreme court enough to do -with revamping
the laws that the people and the legislature place on the statute
books, without also taking over the Job of rewriting the bills that
aren't yet passed}
Apparently not, in view of its latest decision, which orders two
.initiative bills destined to appear on the election ballot next fall re-
Written to eliminate certain parts which are held to be "argumenta
tive."
It is another of those "infallible" five-to-four decisions in

When You Get
a Man Talking
About Styles--
By Mabel Abbott
"Two days in New Yoik disgusted the visiting
teachers of the National Educational association
with the styles worn by New York women," read
George Brown, manager of the Van Noyes hotel,
yesterday afternoon, and looked at me over the
top of his copy of The Times bb if lie considered me
personally resimnsible for this item of telegraph
news.
Oeorge Rrown has opportunities for observation
at his desk in the Van Noyes lobby, and he Is some
thing of a philosopher. I like to hear him talk.
"Well, styles are rather —cr —inadequate, just
now," I remarked encouragingly.
He returned to his paper and read further.
"Tbe teachers believe high school girls of the
United States must be saved from these fashions."
He laid his paper on the switchboard and drum
med thoughtfully on the desk with his fingers, a
far away look coming into his eyes.
"•Humph!" he said finally. ***•'
"Well—maybe so, maybe so. But I don't know
•s girls today need saving any more than those
teachers did when they were girls. That would
have been about the time of the big hoopskirts, I
expect.
AM) THKN—THKN TIIKRK CAMK BTOVUH
"Those hoops were about the first style I ;■<'mem
ber taking notice of. I don't know how wldt they
were, hut 1 remember the trouble the women had
getting through the doorways. The flat wires out
of the old ones our mothers threw away made fine
pea-shooters. With a piece of hoop-skirt wire and
an alder stick you could make a pea-shooter that'd
carry clear across the schoolrpim and hit the teach
er every time.
"Then right after that came the —" he hesitated,
"the hustles.
"1 guess the-girls needed saving then worse than
they ever will again. There's no use talking, a
woman ldoked like a locomotive and a train of
cars, coming down the street with one of those
ungodly things on.
"And about that time, I think It was, they took
to wearing their skirts tied back bo tight they
could hardly walk. It was every bit as funny as
the hobble skirts we raised such Cain about a lit
tle while ago. I don't know but It was funnier, be
cause those old ones had ruffles or something all
up and down them, bo they wobbled.
"And then came the trains, and all the dresses
had two or three feet of cloth dragging on the
ground. I was living In a little town where the
■treets weren't paved, and a woman left a trail
like a log drag everywhere she went.
IT'S THK SIVSIUI i; STYLUS WI FORGKT
"Let's see now. what came next? Styles must
have been kind of sensible for a while, because '
can't remember 'em.
"It ain't the sensible ones you remember. It
must have been somewhere along there, wain't it,
that they had those big sleeves?
"They were stuffed with paper or something,
and you couldn't put more than two or three wom
en into a church pew, because crushing their sleeves
was the one thing they wouldn't stand for.
"Anyway, that brings It pretty close down to
the Merry Widow hats and the slashed skirts—and
that's modern history, an you might say.
"Yes, sir, women wore all those things within
my memory; and I bet tnose teachers can remem
ber some of "em, If they try. Nobody «aved the
girls from hoopskirts, or bustles, or trains, or
bangs, or any other kind of foolishness, but the
country's lived through it some way."
"But what do you really think of present-day
styles?" I asked.
George Brown laughed, and glanced across the
lobby at an extremely neat silk dress that, was prac
tically sleeveless, literally iieckleas and permitted
free exercise of a very smart pair of tall white boots

Our Or Friend
Ardella, Now a
t
Hick, In Town!
"1 love the cows and chickens—
But this is the life!"
When Ardella P. Looinis heard Al Joison, black
face comedian, warble "This Is the Life," at the
Tacoma theater two years ago, he thought it was
the funniest thing he had ever heard.
Just the idea of a hick getting a craving for the
bright lights, and tossing his money away on
chickens (city bred) and bubble-water was worth
a big laugh to Ardella P.
In the first place, A. P. L, had an Ingrowing
hunch that his idea of nothing at all was a reuben
with chin whiskers and a cackling voice, seeing the
sights of a big city.
And when Al Joison cracked his heels together
and sang something about "1 like to r.iise the dick
ens—Oh, this is the life!" Ardella had the supreme
giggle of his life.
For In those days Ardella P. was head of Taco
niii's police department.
He was a city-bred man, with city-bred ideas.
He had lived always In big cities, acting as a po
lice justice and criminal lawyer In an eastern me
tropolis before coming west.
Loomls had always enjoyed a theory that the
country was a fine place to take Fourth of July
picnics, and that farms were only useful In that
they provided milk and vegetables to the cities.
If Al .l.iNi.n ever come** to Tacouia again, and
sings Hi.ii famous ballad of his, A. I*. 1., had
better not be Keen in the audience.
For Al would be just hr likely as not to or
der the spotlight turned on Aide ll.i -. siuiliiH'n
• il bald pate, and King the chorus of his piece
directly into the embarrassed neighborhood
where the former police chief naa enjoying
tbe show.
For Ardella has l>ecome a hick.
He iia regular sure-enough hay seed, by
crlckey. He wouldn't live in a big city again If
you'd give him his choice of any job in the
burg.
Just like the old mnn In the song, Ardella
loven Ills MM and chickens, but he likes to
cavort, about the bright lights of Mroadway
>'n< <• in a while, too. Nobody has accused him
yet of associating with the bubbling water, or
chorus girls, but by jlminy, you can't tell what
us old boys will do next.

"'came to town" yesterday.
Loomis gets up a 5 o'clock every morning at his
ranch near Lemon's Beach, on the Narrows, works
all day In rain or sunshine—(mostly rain, as yet)
and goes to bed with the chickens.
After 4!> years of activity In public life, it's pretty!
hard to get away from the old associations, and
when Loomls reached the city yesterday he headed
straight for the police department.
The former clief spent all afternoon basking in
the tarnished atmosphere of the ancient city jail.
Then he went up to police court, and enjoyed an
hour's performance of the municipal theater.
Just before supper time he started back for the
farm, happy but tired.
l.n»t winter s]x physicians declared that Loomls
had only a few months to live. He occupied a room
in a hospital for months.
He is now healthier than he has ever been for the
past 20 years, and says he will live to be 100.
"I cut clover hay with a scythe for three solid
hours before I came to town today, and I'm not a
bit tired. A year ago the undertaker would have
come for me after I had done a stunt like that," con
cluded the rejuvenated Mr. Loomis.

FUNNY HIDE. THIS ONE IS NO EXCEPTION.
One of the bills which tin court ruled contained l'an;umenta
tive''and thus reprehensible sections —was the first aid measure. It
is designed to suppliment the workmen's compensation law which
has been in operation several years.
Now the compensation law was attacked in the courts some time
ago, and the case was carried before this same supreme court of
ours. That court declared the law legal, constitutional, 0. X., c
pluribui untun and all the rest of it. Much of the reasoning which
led to that decision was the declaration of policy which the law con
tained. \

UNIONISTS
OPEN NEW
CAMPAIGN
The Tacoma Central Labor
Council today net in motion an
"open shop 1' plan.
It set out to use the weapons
which, It claims, the members of
the Taionia Commercial club have
used in backing up the Employ
ers' association proposal to en
force the so-called "open shop"
principle in Tacoma.
A committee of five labor
unionists has been appointed to
carry out the plan, which Is this:
The Labor Council Is arrang
ing to charter "open shop" trains
of six or eight cars once or twice
a week to Seattle. There the
passengers will do their shopping,
go to shows, get refreshments
and otherwise purchase from Se
attle merchants.
To (M Discount.
The Tacoma committee Is ar
ranging for an information bu
reau at the Seattle end to tell the
passengers just where the vari
ous articles may be purchased.
Arrangements are also being
made with Seattle merchants to
have them give a discount on all
cash purchases by Tacoma pa
trons.
"Ninety per cent of Tacoma
merchants are members of the
Commercial club," was the state-!
men! of the committee, today.
"Yet these merchants, while
they urge us to 'buy at home,'
are, an members of the Commer
cial club, going behind the Em
ployers' association's attempts to
briiiß strikebreakers from out of
town to fill the jobs of Tacoma
citizens and home owners.
Gave Club Support.
"When the Commercial club
was reorganized, the labor unions
of the city gave it their whole
hearted support. Now it turns
about and furthers efforts to
bring out-of-town laborers here
and protect them in filling the
jobs of Tacoma citizens.
"We Intend to try out the
'open shop' Idea of buying in Se
attle until the merchants who are
members of the Commercial club
come to reason, or those members
who are not in sympathy with the
club's action to force a change in
its attitude."
