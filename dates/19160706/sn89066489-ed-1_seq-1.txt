Those Who Do
Nearly every community in the
state that has a company of sol
diers in the mobilization camps or
nn thn Mexican border, have done
something for them to make their
duties easier. Bates county Has a
company on duty on the Mexican
border, or it soon will be, and not
to be outdone its citizens have pur
flhAwd mi automobile truck which
was delivered to the company at
Nevada Monday evening.
The money to pay for the truck
is to be raised by popular sub
scriDtion. Mrs. Wm. E. Walton
and Mrs. S. W. Davis represent
insr the Coterie Club took a suh
scription paper around the square
Wednesday and met with a gener-
our response, but more money is
needed. Company B is a Bates
county organization and the whole

way. .
The climate on the Mexican bor
der, especially at this season of
the year is very, hot and there
will be times when the men will
be in camp at some distance from
their base of supplies. It is then
that a motor truck will be almost
invaluable in bringing ice and
supplies and taking sick men to
the base hospital, where they will
receive prompt medical attention.
A short. tim trained in eettine a
man to .the hospital often means
the saving of his lite.

Fourth of July Celebrations.
While there was no organized
celebration in Butler this year
there were, several little parties
who celebrated on their own hook.
The Monday evening club went
out to the Dr. Zey farm north of
town, where they had a picnic
upper, after which the young
sters had a fine fire works dis
play. Several automobile, parties
went to the neighboring towns
where celebrations were being
held. It was. a "Safe and Sane"
Fourth as far as this city was con
cerned. So far as we have been
able to learn there was no acci
dents of the kind which are so
apt to happen when young Ameri
ca celebrates.
One of the most noteworthy
things about the day was that
there was not a drunk man to be
seen on the streets at any time
during the entire day. Men who
have lived here, for over fifty
years tell us that this was the
first time that that has happened
since the town was founded. Only
a few years ago, it was not consid
ered by some people that the day
had been properly celebrated un
less there were a lot of drunks
reeling about the streets.
At Peru there was a celebration
and basket picnic but a heavy rain
coming up in the afternoon cut
shot the merrymaking.
At Hudson the Hudson Town
ship Home Improvement Associa
tion had charge of the celebration.
Owing to the farmers being so
husy with their crops there wi s
only a small crowd out, but those
who were there came with the in
tention of having a good time, and
they did. Rev. R. M. Talbert of
this city, delivered a patriotic ad
dress which was just finished
when the rain came and put an
end to proceedings.
The Union Christian Endeavor
of Virginia had a picnic and hiv-
I per at that place and in the yn-

At Hume there was a big cele
bration. All the candidates for
office, state, county, and township
or any other political subdivision
had been invited to be present and
make speeches and many of them
responded to the invitation.
Mrs. Stofer and . Children Meet
With an Accident.
Mr& Oles Stofer and children,
Zala and Aileene, who have been
visiting relatives in this city met
with a serious accident last
Thursday near 'the home of Mr.
Stofer 's parents near Martin City.
Mrs. Stofer and the children
left Butler Thursday and stopped
for a few days visit with the par

and they started to the Stofer

Stofer and little Aileene on the
front seat with the driver..
After they had turned off the
road to drive up to the house the
front wheels dropped into a mud
hole and Mrs. Stofer and Aileene
were pitched out under the horse,
which stepped on Mrs. Stofer,
breaking three ribs, and kicking
the little girl, breaking the right
arm between the elbow and shoul
der. Mrs. Stofer and little Aileene
were brought to Butler Friday
and taken to the home of Mrs.
Stofer's sister, Mrs. Frank Allen,
where they are getting along as
well as eould be expected, consiq-
enng the serious nature 01 tneir

in her church. She was a member
of the M. E. Church and very ae
tivo in the work of the church, es
peeially that part pertaining to
young people.
