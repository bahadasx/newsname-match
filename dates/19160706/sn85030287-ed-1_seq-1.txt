Notes From Topeka'
Everyone who takes interest
in politics in Topeka are inter
ested in the matter of the candi
dacy of Senator Wm. H. Thomp
son, for a place on the Supreme
Bench of the United States to fill
the vacancy caused by the resig
nation of Mr. Hughes. It is said
that several members of the
Kansas Supreme Court have en
dorsed him, along with' promi
nent members of the Kansas bar,
recognizing his pre-eminent fit"'
nesa for the place coupled with
the factlhat since the death of
of David Brewer, the great Miss
ippi valkv has been without a
representative 6a the Supreme
Bench. The only thing that will
work agaiflst Senator Thomp
son's appointment, seemingly, is
the fact of the closeness of the
division,' politically, of the Sen
ate at present. It is generally
conctdei that rbould the Senator
be appointed that Charles Scott,
of Iola, would fill out the St na
tor's unexpired term. No doubt
if it weren't for the loss of a
Democratic S nator at this criti
cal time, Senator Thompson's
chances would be first class.
From an .ordinary citizen to an
Associate justice of the United'
States Supreme. Court in less
than two decades is going some,
even greater than jack rabbit
speed. 1
On TutsJay of last week, on
passing down Kansas Avenue,
looking in one of the fashionable
cafes ; at the noon lunch hour,
.comfortably . 'seate'Tat iable
were three gentlemen who were
oblivious to all else on this mun
dane sphere, except themselves.
By special arrangements Capt.
Joe .Watters, Col. P.' H. Caney,
and Dept. Commander Parnter
met for lunch. For more than
an hour a flow of witty stones of
early time men of Kansas, the
rise and fall of politicians, stories
of Kansas authors Sol Miller,
Dan Anthony, Gene Ware and on
down to -those of later' days.
From dinner they repaired to
Capt. Waters office and were
. joined by Major Harvey where
they proceeded to carry the war
' into Mexico closing the happy
intellectual feast by the recita-
' tion of some of Capt. Joe's origi
nal poems. Before the adjourn
ment an invitation to a six o'clock
dinner at the home of Capt. Wat
ers in the near future was ac
cepted by all present.
Saturday forenoon Battery D,
of the Massachusets National
Guard marched up from the C.
R. I. & P. Railroad yards and
formed on the State House
grounds at the south side of
the Capitol building. It was
noticed that they were without a
flag. Someone in Memorial Hall
called the attention of the De
partment Commander to the fact
when he and the A. A. 6. at once
sent over a fine silk flag belong
ing to the Department. The
band quickly began playing, "A
Hot Time" and they began the
return march north to the rail
road station amid the cheers of
loyal people who' gathered to
greet them. The flag was re
turned to Headquarters.
The great American bird flap
ped its wings in all the cities and
parks on the 4tb. ' Silver tongued
orators orated, the atmosphere
, was full of patriotism for one
day at least.

Troops Trains Pass
A number of soldier trains,
machine guns,- and equipment
have passed through Meade dur
ing the past ten days, enroute to
the border. The Massachus
etts troops were the first to pass
through, and those from other
states have since followed. All
trains passing through have
been greeted by large numbers
of patriotic Meade people. It is
the hope that war with Mexico
may be averted; that these young
men, the pride of our country,
may return to their homes un
harmed When a train load of
these young men pass, the hor
rors of war come boine more
forcibly than ever. Young men
in the prime of life, and from
the best homes in our land, go
ing, petbaps never to return, or
if they do, perhaps with broken
health or an empty sleeve. Toi
- r
you who urge war, who condemn
President Wilson for his Mex
ican policy, how many sons or
brothers have you to send to
Mexico to fell in battle, to die in
prison, or be shot, at the com
mand of the blood-thirsty Car
ranza? '
. True, there isn't a man to the
United States who would besi
tate to answer bis country's call
if necessary, but let us hope
that the hand of Providence may
point out a settlement other than
by bloodshed.

Increase In Pensions
Washington, Jnly 5. The low.
er House of Congress last week
passed a bill for the benefit of
the widows of Civil War Veter
ans. It provides a substantial
increase in the pensions of such
widows. The friends of the
measure, believe that it will be
passed by the Senate and will
soon beconle a law, as there was
not a yote against it in the House.
Congressman Shouse of the
Seventh Kansas District took an
active part in the framing of this
legislation and getting it through
Congress. The Washington
correspondent of the Cleveland
Plain Dealer told recently of bis
connection with it in the follow
ing dispatch to his paper.
"Largely through the efforts
of Representative Jouett Shouse
of Kansas a bill that will benefit
materially the windows of Civil
War veterans has been reported
favorably to the House of Repre
sentatives. As a member of the
committee oj Invalid Pensions
Representative Shouse urged
favorable action on the measure,
and since its report he has con
ferred with Speaker Champ
Clark on the subject of getting
early consideration in the House.
Speaker Clark is of the opinion it
will be possible to get the bill up
for passage at an early date.
"The bill as it has been re
commended by the Committee
proyides for an increase of $8 a
month in the present pension of
$12 a month to widows of Civil
War veterans, making the new
pension $20 a'montn In case the
widows have reached tbr age of
70 years. Another sectionof the
bill gives pensions to widows of
Civil War veterans who . have
married again and whose second
husbands have died. Under ex
isting law, a widow who draws a
pension loses the pension as soon
as she marries again, and if the
second husband dies or she is
divorced from bim the pension
which she was entitled to origin
ally is not allowed her again. In
some cases the widow of one
Civil War veteran marries an
other old soldier, thereby losing
ber pension. If the second vet
eran dies, the pension is not re-

i - Union Meetings '
In a meeting of the pastors
and a committee of laymen on
Monday evening it was decided
to arrange for a union meeting
of all the churches on Sunday
evenings during the summer
months. The first meeting will
be held on the Court house lawa
next Sunday evening. One of
the local pastors will preach and
take their turn during the sum
mer. This is not a new thing at
all as t is . being done all over the
country and Meade, does'1 not
want to be behind the times. It
is to be hoped that this arrange
ment will be made each summer
and thus add to the spiritual in
terest of all the churches. We
hope to see a record crowd on
the opening evening.
Prof. Holms will have charge
of the 'music and he is anxious to
organize a big chorus and a good
orchestra as it is hoped .to make
good music one of the leading
features of these meetings.

will correct all such unfair dis

"Before the committee finally
agreed on the pension bill as it
now stands there were some
stormy sessions, but Represent
ative Shouse fought hard aod
consistently for the principles
of the bill."
