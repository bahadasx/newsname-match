Blackberries!
" You get nothing in this world without work " is a
common saying, but how about blackberries?
The fact is that God Almighty is so tender-hearted
a Father that he gives us a great deal without work. Child
ren do not earn their parents and first home. None of
us earn air, water, or the wonderful outfit of our own
bodies.
It is true that work brings the very highest pay, not
only in the things we get by work, but in the develope
ment of our own capacity for higher joyt. The worker
shares God's own pleasure as a Creator.
Dut God's love breaks out in the flowers that grow
among the weeds, and especially in blackberries. God
wants every child and every beggar, and every tramp no
matter how good-for-nothing, to have pleasure that is real
and sure, and that costs nothing: hence blackberries!
Are You A Christian?
This question is sometimes asked of nearly everybody.
And when no one asks us the question, it asks itself of each
person's heart Am I a Christian?
Of course we say a Christian is a follower of Christ.
But what is it to follow Christ ? What were the big things
in the teachings and temper of Christ ? How can I, how
should I, feel and' act in order to be a true follower of
Christ? v
We all know and say that some people who "claim"
to be Christians, and some who think they are Christians
are not truly Christians.' Am I among these hypocriti
cal or deceived ones ?
Shall I miss anything if I do not find out about these
questions ?
I am glad Dr. Lamar is coming to Berea this month,
and that we are all going to drop other things and study
these great questions.
NITRATE PLANT AT MUSCLE
SHOALS
The establishment by the gu em
inent of the murh-talked-of nitrate
plant at Muscle Shoals, on the Ten
nessee river, will mean more for
the entire South in an industrial
way than anything ever proposed
for this section.
The construction of this plant at
Muscle Shoals will not only supply
all of the nitrates that the govern
ment will need for the manufacture
of munitions of war, but it will also
irenerale 6H0.OOO horsepower of hy-dro-eleetrio
current This volume
of current would today run all of
the machinery in the Smith. In ad
dition to this it would automatic
ally eolve the problem of the navi
gation of the Tennessee river be
tween the foot of the Muscle Shoals
and Chattanooga, as the erection of
the icreal dam for the purpose of
generating hydro-electric power to
manufacture the nitrates will at
the fame time make the Tennessee
river practically navigable all the
year round to Knoxville.
Picture to yourselves, citizens of
the South, the hundreds of impor
tant industries which would follow
the establishment of this great plant.
There would be huge electric fur
naces for the manufacture of the
finest grades of steel, establishments
for the production of aluminum
from the vast deposits of bauxite
which abound In the South, plants

for the production of ammonium
phosphate rork, brought from the
southern fields, will be combined
with the nitrates and converted in
to that important ingredient of all
phosphate.
Think of the profitable employ
ment which would be offered thous
ands of young men of the South, and
the capital which would be brought
to this section.
But. most important and vital of
all, think of the wonderfully produc
tive and profitable farms which
would result from the production
of high-grade, cheap, commercial
fertilizers for the whole South.
This is infinitely the most impor
tant result which would accrue from
the establishment of this nitrate
plant Give the farmer cheap fer
tilizers, increase the production of
his lands, and you not only make
the farmer rich and independent,
but at the same time, you build
cities and towns and furnish life
, and substance for the transporta
tion companies.
I Ts such a plant, then, worth the
energy and effort required to secure
it? Most emphatically, YES l' The
location of such a plant in the South
Is worth every effort that the peo
ple of this section ran bring to bear
upon those in authority to induce
them to choose the Muscle Shoals
location.
Rally around the standard, then,
southern citizens, and make the most
of this golden opportunity.
The Citizen will on the 15th, open

E. Paso, Texas, July I. Another
"hot trail" was followed Into Mexico
bv American forces when Captain Le-

Eighth cavalry, crossed south of Fort
Hancock, fifty miles east of El Paso,
after the Mexican raiders who com
mitted depredations on the American
aide of the line.
Cantaln Eltlnce was stationed at
Fattens, midway between El Paso and
Fort Hancock and Immediately plunged
across the river with his command,
followed, ft Is said, by other troops 01

The raiders, in addition to driving

region, attacked the abandoned Fort
Hancock and the detachment of Unit
ed States troops at that point The
troops being small In number wore
unable to follow at once and by the
time they could reach the Rio Grande
the bandits had escaped. The lieu
tenant commanding did not consider
his force sufficiently large to risk bat
tie with the bandits and a possible
command of Carranslstas reported In
the Immediate vicinity, hence he
halted his forces at the International
boundary.
Captain Elttnge and Ma force were
ordered to the scene with Instructions
from General George Belt, command
ing the American patrol district to
"go In," If he thought he could punlah
the bandits and recover the horses
stolen in Texas. The captain crossed
with his command Immediately on
reaching the scene ot the raid. Flsut
