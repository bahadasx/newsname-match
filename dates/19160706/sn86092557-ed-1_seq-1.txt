jtlie Marlon county agricultural society
' lin compliance with the amendment of
(the atate ? statute whereby the county
agricultural agent la to be paid from
lltHe general county fund. This amend
ment was passed by the legislature

guarantee to pay all the field and office
^expenses of the agents. This memor
andum will be approved by the court
likely today and will Insure the prompt
and satisfactory payment of the sal
nffyfof Mr. Smitn for the ensuing year.
This arrangement is practically the
same as has been In effoct during tho
Tuaca Morris on tjehalf of a number
lot persons who live on the dirt road
from the Country club to Tucker Sta
tion on the West Fork river asked
that the court build a satlstactory ap
proach at the crossing of this road and
Kho Mono'ngahela Valley Traction line.
The new concrete pavement at this
place is several feet below the tracks
and old road so that it is now impos
sible to use the road. The court or
dered Engineer Wilfong to build a
?wail and approach to the crossing.
fAU of yesterday afternoon was spent
the members of the court and tho
committee from Lincoln district In in
ipecting the improved roads In Fair
mont district. They appear to be well
1 pleased wflh the manner in which the
new roads have withstood the severe
-winter. Tomorrow it is planned to
I Tislt the new paved roads of Manning
jf ton district.
frfe^Nelther the county court or the

trict The order authorizing the ad
vertisement and sale of the $650,000

i*tho-Intention of the committee to
sic for bids on the various contracts,
^conditional to the sale of tho bonds.
Iso^'that actual work on these roads
jrpfty be started not later than the
jit.of August if possible.
??No action has as yet been taken by
J^he citizens of the district who claim
I .that the bond election was illegal.
-Their failure to be granted a contest
following the recount of the votes
makes the next logical step against
the bond Issue probably an injunction
restraining the court from the sale
Sofjthe bonds.

GOOD 110 IS MADE
But at That But Three Dis
tricts Have Medical
T^spectioru
According to the statistics recently
prepared by county superintendent
Toothman Marlon county spent ap
proximately $32.40 during the past
! year for the education of each pupil
enrolled in the public schools of the
county. The eutlre sum paid out by
the sheriff during the past fiscal year
from the school fund was $323,789.09.
This Includes the sums spent for the
buildings and for teacher's salaries
and various other expenses.
The total number of pupils enrolled
In the county for the year reached
11,959, but of this number only 9,883
were in attendance at the close of the
school year.
The school fund distributed by the
sheriff is approximately $27,000 more
thiB year than the preceding year. The
total for the fiscal year of 1914-15 was
$296,761.06. This Is a comparatively
good showing and places Marlon Co.
well up among the list of West Virgin-,
ia counties in educational work.
Thero Is yet much ? room for Im
provement in this county however asi
only Fairmont, Paw Paw and Man
nlngton districts have medical inspec
tion, although Union Independent dis
trict also has inspection. Many of the
country schools have no libraries "at
| all and in practically all districts in
the county at present school build
! Ings are rapidly becoming inadequate
to house the increasing number of pu
j pils.
! The total number of pupils grad
uated from the grade schools was 505,
I while from tho High school but 127
received diplomas. The total High
I school enrollment reached 1,032. Of
tho 374 teachers employed in the
county, 133 are attending summer
school at various places.
I The majority of the 374 teachers
| will again be at their desks this win
] ter although It Is estmlated that al
most twenty of tho women teachers
either have or are about to become
I married. An almost negllgable per
j centage of the newly married teach
ers after marriage are more apt to
continue their profession than oth
erwise.

It is Still Anybody's Race in
The Seven Thousand Club
Everything i8 ready for the close
o fthe West Virginian's Seven Thou
BAnd Club this Saturday night at nlno
o'clock. It has without a doubt been
by a far the most successful circula
tion campaign ever inaugurated in
Fairmont and in fact In this part of
the state. But there is still much
work to be done between now and the
closo. The many big prizes are hang
ing in. the balance and-a little extra
effort at this time can throw them
olther way among a score of the lead
ing club members. - ? ? ~ ?
In order that each and every candi
date will understand clearly about thb
close of tho campaign on Saturday^
we print today the few simple rules
Uiat will apply on that night.
Every facility will t*irafforded (he
club members, and their friends fog
getting all their votes and subscrip
tions properly handled. tixporleiue
teaches us that in the hustle and ex
citement of the close there are many
questions that come up, and workers
who sometimes get tangled up and
tail to got their votes and subscrip
tions In until die last mlnuto.
Therefore it is the desire of the
West Virginian that you read over
these rulings carefully so that all
confusion will be avoided. All through
the campaign It has beon tho para
mount idea of this paper to give all
workers an equal chance and fair play
all around, and we would dhllke to
see any.candidate lose a single vote
because of some misunderstanding In
the excitement of the closing tfours.
