COMMUNICATION CONCILIATORY
Belief in Washington that Pershing's
Expedition Will Soon Return to
U. S. Territory.
Washington,. Tuly It was officially
announced by Secretary Lansing to
day that a reply would be sent to the
latest note of Gen. Carranza and that
it would be foi warded soon.
Washington, July 6. The crisis be
tween the United states and Mexico
virtually came to an end yesterday
when a friendly and conciliatory note
from the tie facto government was
handed to Secretary Lansing and
promptly communicated to President
Wilson. Formal statement of the at
titude of the Washington government
must await the president's action, but
there is no doubt in the minds of of
ficials that the way has been opened
for an anilcablo adjustment of the
dispute its to the border situation
which brought tho two governments
to the verge war.
High officials were much impressed
by the complete change in tune Bhown
in Gen. Carranza's new note. It was
described by one as "mere than con
ciliatory." There seemed to be no
disposition to doubt that the United
States on its side would be willing
to arrange for the early withdrawal of
the expeditionary force from Mexico.
The Mexican note does not make
the specific explanation of orders giv
en to Qen Trevino sought by Secretary
Lansing's last communication. Gen
Carranza was then informed that the
order to attack Gen. Pershing's men
If they moved east, south or west, in
Mexico, was construed as an act of
deliberate hostility. The declaration
that the Carranza government will
seek every means to avoid new in
cidellts tn an::ravalc the situation, is
regarded as a virtual withdrawal of the
order.
It is not known whether a formal
reply to Gen. Carranza's note is con
templated. Diplomatic usage does not
call for one, and many otlicials feel
that more can be accomplished
through informal discussion between
Mr. Arredondo and Counselor I'olk,
who will act as secretary in Mr. Ijui-
sing's absence, than could be hoped for
in any other way.

If Mrs. Hetty Green was not the

painted as miserliness, well and good;
if she was depicted as moving 'twixt

reply; she had her life and dared to
live it without compromise or con

no person, rich, poor, miser or spend

nothing of happiness, from the effort

rovides Irish House of Commons
of 78 Members
RETAIN SEATS IN LONDON
Temporary Settlement to Continue
Until End of War When Imperial
Conference Meets.
London. July (I. The complete de
vils of Lloyd George's scheme for pro
islonal home rule for Ireland is pub
lished in the London morning papers to
day. The following are the principal
features:-"

nee to the Irish Parliament of 7S

ties. (The total Irish representation

102, of which 25 members sit for the
six Ulster counties provisionally ex
cluded from home rule I.
Second: Of the 78 members to be
transferred to the Irish house, ,n are
nationalists or Independents, while
wo are unionists, namely sir Edward
'arson and J, II. M. Campbell, attor
ney General lor Ireland. I hese two
members represent Trinity college,
Dublin. They have both consented
to sit in the home rule Parliament and
on this fact some hopes are based for
future amity.
Third. Members of the Irish Com
mons will retain their seats in the
English House and will be often seen
there as the Irish body is not expected
to have business to transact at first.
Fourth: Considerable representa
tion of the unionist Interests in the

Every One Was Satisfied.
A very angry client entered n New

upon a debtor and asked him politely
to pay a bill of $2.50 anil had been
abused for his pains. Now he wanted
the lawyer to collect It.
Th ! lawyer demurred. The bill was
so small that it would cost the whole
amount to collect It.
"No mutter." said the angry one. "I
don't care If I don't get a cent as long
as that fellow has to pay It!"
So the lawyer wrote the debtor a
letter, and In a day or two the lattrr
appeared In high ipjulgeoitl He did not

Second Line Trenches in Section
South of Somme.
London, Thursday. July 6. In the
Franco-British offensive on the Somme
the French made substantial gains yes
terday, while the British engaged in
heavy lighting all along their front, re-
ordtng at the end of the day: "Our
troops advanced sugauyrin certain
seit ions, and lost no ground gained."
North of the Soiiime the French car
led by assault the second German
lines on a front of two kilometers, (a
mile and a quarter.) from the Clery-
Murlcourt Hoard, northwest of Per-
onne to the tuver homme. iney al
so captured the village of Hem, in the
same district.
South of the Somme the French cap
tured all the German second positions
on a front of about ten ktlomemters.
(six and one-quarter miles). They al
so completed the occupation of the
village of Kstrees, where 200 Germans
surrendered.
In the section south of the Somme
the French are now in the outskirts of
l'eronne, the great railway center,
which is their first objective in their
effort to cut the German communica
Hons.
Sormont Farm, now held by the
French, is ony two miles from l'eronne
and adjoining its suburban houses. The
Importance which the Germans attach
to this point is shown in their tierce
counterattack last night when they
rushed the French lines back to the
village of Itelloy-en-Sr.iiterre., which
they momentarily held. This village
lies In tween Assevillers and F.stroe.s
both held bv the French, so that the
Gorman rush temporarily made a dent
in the French advance. This dent was
quickly straightened out when fierce
hand to hand fighting placed the town
again in French hands.
The number of German prisoners
taken is now more than ir.""0. while
the extent of the munitions captured is
shown by the fact that sixty puna were
taken by a single French army corps
Meantime the French movements
north of the Somme are necessarily n
tarded In order that the French left
wing may act simultaneously with the
British right wing.

Buenos Aires. July 6. It is reported

The war cloud grows out of a dispute

RUSSIAN REPORTS DENIED
Austrian War Office Says Their Claims
Are Untrue.
Vienna, July 4. A statement issued
by War Press Headquarters denies
Russian allegations regarding the num
ber of prisoners taken, etc., and deals
especially with the Russian report ot
June 27 which announced that more
than lm.nnii men had been captured,
together with 211) guns and 044 ma
chine guns.
The statement says it has now been
possible to establish details which
could not be verified during the first
days of the Russian offensive. In
modern warfare, It Is pointed out,
losses of more than 25 per cent, are in
no wise uncommon, but it is declared
that the Austrian troops lost at the
most from 12 to 20 per cent., dead,
wounded, and prisoners, showing that
there was no need for Austrian uneasi
ness.
If we had actually lost 200.000 pris
oners, says the statement, "it would
mean, with addition of a commensurate
quota of dead and wounded, that we
would not have a single soldier left
either in Volhynia or on the Dniester.
Thirty six guns of modern pattern fell
into the hands of the enemy. They
had been blown up or otherwise des-
troyed. The number of built-in guns
.of old pattern, abandoned to the Rus
sians is only greater by a few."
The statement says the alleged num
ber of machine guns is high "even for
Russian reports." The number of
such guns which had been delivered to
Austrian troops in substitution for
guns lost or used up, It is asserted,
was not one-sixth of the number which
the Russians have reported taking.
The statement also declares that the
Russians have frequently reported de
tails of battles that never occurred.
and that 'even subordinate Russian
leaders often permit themselves poetic
license in their reports."

one death an hour was maintained yes

and lo o'clock yesterday morning in
the five boroughs of New York city.
During that period 178 no' cases wero
reported. Of this number 157 were in

lirooklyn. In one Brooklyn hospital
yesterday thero were 225 children, vic
tims of the disease, many of whom, it
was said, had slight chances of recov
ery.
The officers of the health department
were besieged all day uy a crowd or
men, women and childre n, mostly for
eigners, who, terrified by reports of
the disease, demanded medical ad
vice. It was necessary to summon
extra policemen to preserve order and
at one time those waiting for an aud-

which extended for nearly a block.
Since June 20. when the epidemio
took hold, 702 cases have been report

yesterday that cooler weather which
