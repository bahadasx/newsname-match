MEXICAN CRISIS ENDED
Conciliatory Note From Carranza.
The crisis between the United States
and Mexico virtually came to an end
yesterdoy when a friendly and concilia
tory note from the de facto Government
was handed to Secretary Lansing
promptly communicated to Presiden
Wilson.
Formal statement of the attitude
tne Washington Government must
await the President's action, but there
is no doubt in the minds of official
that the way has been opened for
amicable adjustment of the dispute
to the border situation, which brought
the two Governments to the verge of
war.
becretary Lansing himself would
make no comment. He gave the im
pression, however, that Gen. Carranza's
suggestion that there is no pending
question between the Governments
that cannot be readily answered by
friendly negotiation meets with quick
sympathy here.
Mr. Lansing is known to share Prest
dent Wilson's desire that hostilities be
avoided if there is any possible way to
safeguard American border interests
without a clash with the Carranza Gov
ernment. The new Mexican communi
cation so plainly indicates a similar de
sire that a further Interchange of
views is expected to begin immediately
looking to joint efforts to curb border
bandits and otlierjrresponsible agencies
that have worked to embroil the two
Government!.
High officials were much impressed
by the complete change in tone shown
n lien, larranza s new note. It was
described by one asmore than eon
dilatory." There seems to be no dis-
ition to doubt that the United
States on its side would be willing to
arrange for the early withdrawal of
the expeditionary force from Mexico.

which was advertised to tune place at
8;30 o'clock, the crowd began to pour
into this delightful little hamlet and
soon the streets and approaches of the
city were lined with 1 uggies. automo

means of transortatiun, that they
might not miss a single one of the

Danville military band was on the
scene early and gave some splendid
music, intermingled with many patriot

and encores from the pleased public.

people was never more clearly demon

kets overloaded with everything that

good ladies and invitutions were ex
tended with a sincerity thst could only
be surpassed by the hearty welcome
that was accorded you nt the dinners
which were spread under the shade of
the beautiful Sycamores.
It was estimated that fully three
thousand people were on the grounds

money maker it was thought that the
promoters would come out a little alu-ml

the crowd was admirable; the repre

and added very much to the entertain
