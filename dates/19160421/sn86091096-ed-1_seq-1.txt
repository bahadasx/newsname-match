MET HB
Much Enthusiasm Displayed
by Business Men.
The Kendrick baseball club held
a boosters' meeting: at the Barnum
Hall Wednesday evening. Walter
t Thomas acted as chairman and
Adolph Wegner secretary. The
purpose of the meeting was to start
the baseball season in good shape
financially. Many plans were dis
cussed and a benefit dance and
basket social was finally decided
upon. The Kendrick Orchestra
volunteered to furnish music for the
dance free of charge and Mr. Bar
num offered to donate the use of
the hall for that night. A pro
gram committee of three, Walter
McCrea, H. Busse and A. V. Dunkle,
was then appointed.
It was'agreed that all who in
tend to try for a position on the
team, should deposit three dollars
with the treasurer. This money is
to remain in the treasury providing
the one who makes the deposit be
comes a member of the team, other
wise fifty cents and a season ticket
to the games will be refunded.
A committee consisting of George
Barnum, O. E. MacPherson and 0.
K. Hill was appointed. This com
mittee will receive subscriptions,
attend to season tickets and in fact,
do anything to rustle the coin.
A committee of five was then ap
pointed to meet with the Kendrick
Fair Board and endeavor to make
arrangements with the board to
have the ball grounds fenced.
Norris Walker, Guy Lewis, Prof.
Best. Adolph Wegner and Frank
Candee were the ^members chosen
to act on this committee.
One of the most serious draw
backs to the financial success of a
ball club has been the lack of an
inclosed park. If the grounds were
fenced so that all admissions might
be collected, there is no question
but that Kendrick's baseball team
would be self-supporting. Ken
drick is an enthusiastic baseball
town and is always willing to stand
back of a good team.
Mr. George P. Barnum was
made permanent manager of the
Kendrick club. He has had several
season's experience in looking after
the interests of the ball fans of the
town and with a goodly number of
boosters back of him, will turn out
a winning team again this year.
It is planned to have a big open
ing game on the home grounds,
Friday, April 28. If the plans art
carried out there will be a parade
at 1:30 to the ball park headed by
the Kendrick Band. In the even
ing a big dance and basket social
will take place. Sure sounds like a
good time.
Engines Expected Today
According to telegraphic com
(Ä'mication received la^st night, the
«Engines for the Potlatch Electric
Light plant should be is Kendrick
today. Mr. Dunkle estimates that
ten days after the engines arrive
the lights will be turned on.
Death at Juliaetta
Frank Groves, whose farm is
about two miles north of Juliaetta,
died at his home Saturday night.
He was 72 years old. Five mem
bers of the K. P. lodge went from
here to act as pall bearers.
The past winter and this spring
has recorded the deaths of quite a
number of old people in Juliaetta
and vicinity, ranging in age from
60 to 94 years. Mrs. Harriet Roe
has out-lived them all—she

PROPOSED PLANS
FORJGHWAYS
Lewiston Men Interested in
Project
a
The Lewiston business men will
extend their activities toward high
way construction beyond the limits
of the Lewiston highway district
and will endeavor ao secure favor
able action by the board of county
commissioners for the construction
of a highway along Clearwater
river above Arrow Junction. These
plans were disclosed at a meeting
of the Commercial club when Presi
dent P. R. Bevis stated that R. L.
Spiker is engaged in the organiza
tion of a delegation to go before
the commissioners and ask for some
action that would bring about the
highway construction along the
upper Clearwater.
A plan for a river highway has
been under discussion for several
years and Clearwater county has
indicated its willingness to join in
the plans and has inaugurated con
struction work at a number of
points where such improvements
will fit into the plans for a river
highway that will conform to the
plans and specifications of the state
highway system.
The plans to be proposed to the
commissioners provide for the open
ing of three miles of new highway
this year. It is stated much vol
unteer work would be furnished by
residents of the district affected
and that by getting the 'cohstruc
tion work under way it is felt the
matter of extending the road to the
Nez Perce-Clearwater county line
can be successfully handled.
Attorney W. C. Counter gave
notice to the board that he would
later ask that the Commercial club
join in the movement to secure thq
construction of a highway from
Leland to Fir Bluff on the Clear
water. It is explained this high
way would connect the Potlatch
country with the proposed river
highway and would serve a large
community. It would bring a large
section to the Clearwater river t.iat
now is practically isolated from
transportation facilities.—Tribune.
Death of Emil Wegner
Emil R. Wegner died at the
home of his parents on Big Pot
latch ridge, Thursday morning at
eight o'clock. The cause of his
death was chronic Brights disease.

previous to his last illness was
studying for the ministry.
He spent two years at Olympia
College, Washington and the last
two years at the Phalen Lutheran
Seminary at St. Paul. He was
compelled to give up his studies
and returned home February 13
His health gradually failed until
death relieved him of his suffering.
The burial will take place at the
Cameron cemetery Saturday.
Queen Esther Circle
The Queen Esther Circle met at
the home of Miss Bernadine Plum
mer Saturday night April 15. The
meeting was opened with prayer,
by Mrs. Best. The minutes of the
previous meeting were read and
accepted, after which the following
program was rendered.
"An Open Door for M. E. Wo
men," Ella Blackburn.
"The How and the Why of Queen

The regular meeting of the Q. E. C.
will be on Tuesday evening. Miss
Abrahamson appointed Ruth Dam
marell and Nellie Blackburn to serve
on the program committe. because
the President was absent.
Gladys Keller and Helen Durbin
were elected to serve as flower
committee for the church.
The flower committee to carry
flowers to the sick was elected and
is composed of:— Bernadine Plum
mer and Rosebud Brown. A num
ber of other things came up before
the society.
A very dainty lunch was served
by Miss Bernadine with the help of
a number of the girls.
The lunch consisted of sandwiches,
pickles, cake, cookies and cocoa.
After lunch was served the crowd
talked of burglars, until they were
afraid to go home, but Mrs. Best
and Miss Abrahamson saw that
all got home safely.—Secretary
Juliaetta Play Appreciated
"Tony The Convict," a play given
at the Barnum Theatre Saturday
night by Juliaetta local talent, was
well received here. Those who took
part in the play showed that they
had received careful coaching and
that they were perfectly familiar
with their parts.
C. W. Semmes, editor of the
Juliaetta Independent took the lead
ing part, Tony the Convict, and the
success of the play was largely due
to the manner jn which he carried
out his part.
There were eleven members in
the caste and they are to be con
gratulated on the manner in
which they carried out the play.
The audience, though small, was
generous in its applause.

convention held at Moscow last Fri
day, passed resolutions pledging the
united support of the Latah county
delegation to the state convention
at Twin Falls, held yesterday, to
support United States Senator
William E. Borah as its choice as
the republican presidential nominee.
Twenty-four delegates were elected
to attend the convention at Twin
Falls and they were to go without
instructions except for the express
ions in behalf of Senator Borah.
The convention convened at the
court house at eleven o'clock and
A. H. Oversmith was elected as
temporary chairman. Homer E.
Estes was named temporary secre
tary. The representation at the
convention was by far the most
general of any republican county
convention ever held in Latah
county. A feature of the conven
tion was the presence on the floor
of many women delegates.
The appearance of former Con
gressman Burton L. French was
the signal for a prolonged burst of
applause and it was many minutes
before the convention hall could be
quieted. His address also proved
popular.
In the resolutions adopted by the
convention, in addition to endorsing
Mr. Borah for the presidency. Bur
ton L. French was given the vigor
ous endorsement of the meeting as
ous as
a candidate for election to the house
of representatives.
The people of the state were con
gratulated on the reunion of the
progressive and republican parties,
and urged to support for the gover
norship a safe, sound, conservative
business man. The last legislature
was complimented upon the passage
of the dry laws, and the constitu
tional amendment for statewide
prohibition was endorsed. The
improvement of roads, conservation
of the state lands, investigations of
railway rates, liberal appropriations
for the educational institutions,
simplified forms of government
procedure, and rural credits were
topics of comment. Candidates for
the legislative ticket will be pledged
to oppose county division. The
efforts of the commissioners to in
stall the tract index system were
commended.
Delegates to the Twin Falls con
vention were elected as follows:
Burton L. French, Ben E. Bush,
Columbus Clark, George P. Barnum,
S. E. Hutton, M. E. Lewis, G. C.
Hoyt, Arnold Lyon, Elmer Paulson,
