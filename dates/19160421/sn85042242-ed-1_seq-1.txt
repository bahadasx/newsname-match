to Be Urged in Halls of
Congress.
Washington, A,pril 20.—Impure
dairy products which are being con­
sumed daily by the American people
in more or less large quantities were
discussed today before the rules com­
mittee of the house of representatives
when that body held an official hear­
ing on the resolution of Representa­
tive J. Charles iLinthicum of Mary­
land, calling for the appointment of
a congressional committee to make
a nation-wide probe of the unwhole­
some conditions alleged to prevail in
the dairy and creamery business in
many parts of the country.
Expert Testimony.
Rxporl testimony was given to I ho
effect that an investigation would be
a good thing for the country, if only
to establish the truth or the falsity
of the charges that there is a great
deal of tuberculosis in dairy cows,
which is transmitted to children and
that at least the desirability of hav­
ing federal inspection of milk, butter
and cheese should be looked into.
Among the witnesses were: Dr. A.
D.- 'Melvin. chief of the federal bu­
reau of animal industry Dr. John R.
•Mohkc.*, assistant chief off the Ibu
reau, and prominent women dele­
gates sent down from women's or­
ganizations and civic societies in New
York and Philadelphia. Those, who
testified on the other side of the mat­
ter were: Dr. G. L. McKay, secre­
tary of the American Association of
Creamery Butter Manufacturers, and
.Mr. William Creasy, secretary of the
National Dairy Union.
.. liepresenlative _Po,u of NorJh Caro
liiia presided as acting chairman of
the comniiittee Other members of
the committee who participated in
the discussion Were: Lenroot of Wis­
consin, Campbell of 'Kansas, Chiper
field of Illinois, Garrett of Tennessee
and Cantrill of Kentucky. Repre­
sentatives lHaugen of [ovva and Sloan
of Nebraska, although not members
of tlie committee, also questioned
the witnesses.
Conducted Hearing.
Representative Linthicum conduct­
ed the hearing personally, assisted by
Ralph iH. Case of Washington, gen­
eral counsel, and John H. Ferguson,
president of the Maryland Federation
of Labor and the District of Colum­
bia Federation of Labor. Among the
exhibits presented by Mr. Linthicum
were resolutions and letters of en­
dorsement. from 42'0 state and city
health and food officials, labor unions,
civic organizations, women's clubs
and societies for the study and pre­
vention of tuberculosis, from all pars
of the country.
Something Wrong.
Articles pointing out emphatically
that something is wrong with the
dairy business of the country wer|
presented from Hoard's Dairyman,
owned and edited by former Gover­
nor Hoard of Wisconsin, the Chicago
Dairy Produce and the American iFood
Journal. In this connection the state­
ment was made that of the 1,500,001)
pounds of butter produced annually
in this country only 15 per cent is
first, grade.
When questioned by iMr. Case Dr.
Melvin said that a large percentage
of the dairy products used by the
American people is not wholly fit for
consumption. He declared that local
inspection is not sufficeint that he
does not. know of a single state which
has a comprehensive inspection sys
tem, and that there is still room for
improvement even though conditions
are better now than in 1912.
Disease Among Children.
®r. E. C. Schroadder, federal go|
ernment expert on tuberculosis in
dairy products, testified that tubercu­
losis from bovine infection is a rath
er common disease among children.

ADMITS GOING
ON JOY RIDES
Minneapolis, April 20.—Joseph W.
Bragdon, "the Uncle Ned" of the vice
investigation, who was called as a
witness in his own defense today,
branded as false the revolting stories
which were told against him oi) the
stand yesterday and Thursday.
Bragdon sketched briefly the' story
of his life, admitted having taken
various girls in the case on automo­
bile rides during the year 1913, and
denied emphatically and in detail,
the stories of two of those girls that
liberties were taken with them on
those rides.
"It is absolutely false simply
dream-stories on their part," was his
characterization of their statements
A Philanthropist.
Bragdon testified that he had all
his life taken an active interest in
charitable work especially in the in
terest of juveniles, and he had inno
cently taken young girls riding in his
car.
Through the principal witness for
the state, known as Marjorie, he met
two girls, known as Irene and Ellen.
He was introduced to them as "Uncle
Ned." hut denied that he had ever
adopted any nieces.
Denies Bella's Story.
He admitted taking the three girls
to a carnival on Lake street in May,
19111, and also admitted taking them
to the vicinty of Minnehaha Falls in
August, 1913. He flatly denied the
story of Delia, a 12-year-old witness
for the state, who said that', while on
the Minnehaha trip, Bragdon had left
the automobile standing by the road­
side, and carrying a blanket had tak
en the two older girls, one at a time,
into the woods, some distance from
the car, and remained there som
considerable time.
Admits Going to Woods.
Bragdon said that, alone, he had
gone into the woods a short distance
from the car. While he was gone no
less than eight automobiles passed
his machine, which was standing by
the side of the road. When he re
turned, the girls were engaged in
picking flowers. He said that on all
his trips with the girls, nothing of a
questionable nature had occurred.
The state's lirst big coup in the
trial of Joseph W. Bragdon, charged
with an offense against a young girl,
was sprung in District Judge Joseph
W. Molyneaux's court late today
when a 13-year-old girl was sum­
moned as a witness to identify the
defendant as the 'Uncle Ned" who
drove her and two other girls to Medi­
cine lake in the early summer of
1913.
One of the other girls was Mar­
jorie, the state's principal witness,
who has accused Bragdon of an of­
fense against her on an automobile
trip to Minnehaha falls and has also
testified that a similar offense was
committed by the defendant on the
Medicine lake ride.
Was 10 at Time of Alleged Trip.
Delia, the 13-year-old for whom a
subpena was issued today, was only
10 years old at the time of the trip
She was expected by the state to
testify she had gone to Medicine lake
with a man known to her as 'Uncle
Ned," accompanied by Marjorie and
Irene, another witness. The state
does not contend that any impro­
priety toward her took place.
The state's decision to call Delia
as a witness followed a dramatic inci­
dent that occurred in Judge Moly
neaux's courtroom late yesterday, un
known to judge, jury, defense attor­
neys or spectators.
Delia was quietly brought into the
courtroom by a private detective. Un
obtrusively she took a seat a few
feet from the defense table.
'Do you see him anywhere?" whis
pered the detective.
The child unhesitatingly pointed at
the defendant.
She was immediately hurried from
the room.
Delia, mentioned by Marjorie in her
original story to the grand jury, was
not found by the state until yester­
day.
On direct examination late yester­
day she had told of trips to Medicine

San Antonio, Texas, April 20.—•
While Major General Hugh iScot.t,
chief of stall', is hurrying to the bor­
der as the personal envoy of Secre­
tary of War Baker, General .Pershing
is holding his forces in Mexico in
what practically is a defensive posi
ion. No developments ol' great iin
prtance were told of in reports re­
ceived today at General Funston's
headquarters, and it was evident that
the pursuit of Villa had been halted.
Unofficial reports were that Vila had
made his way south into Durango, al­
though official '.Mexican advices con
inued to indicate that officials at the
war department, in 'Mexico City still
«ive some credit, at least, to the sto­
ry that, the bandit chieftain had died
at. some point south of Cusiuhirachic.
Amplify German Trouble.
On Monday the Chihuahua city
newspapers printed dispatches sup­
posed to have come from Juarez,
stating President Wilson was about
to deliver an ultimatum to Germany
and war would be declared within a
week. This information was brought
here from Chihuahua by Americans
returning from Chihuahua City.
The arrivals said the news of a
crisis pending between Germany and
the United States was common talk
in Chihuahua City on Sunday, 48
hours before the facts were made
public in this country. On Monday,
an American who visited Guirrez was
greeted with this remark:
"Well, I suppose the (Mexican situ­
ation has becoiiftv of ranior import­
ance now that the United States is
going to war with Germany."
Mexicans Keep Informed.
The Americans who returned here
said the Mexicans were being kept
fully acquainted with every step in
the negotiations between Berlin and
Washington through an official agen­
cy in Mexico City and they knew
more about the crisis between the
United States and Germany than tlley
did about the pursuit of Villa.
Drive Americans Out.
Major J. M. Carpio, of General Ob

London, April 20.--The arrival in
France of a large?-number of Rus­
sian troops to'reinforce the western
battle line has brought joy to the al­
lied countries, where ii in thought
with I hem lighting shoulder to shoul­
der at different, .points with the
French, British and Belgians, a dif­
ferent change may develop shortly.
Mow many Russians have been sent
across the sea by JOmperor Nicholas
is not known, but is described as "a
great flotilla of transports, arrived in
the harbor of 'Marseilles, and almost
immediately, afterward landed the
forces, amid the cheering of the pop­
ulace and, the French troops gathered
to greet them. Salutes were fired
from shore batteries. General Joffre,
the French commander-in-chief, in
welcoming the .Russians, said the'
were soldiers chosen from the brav­
est in the Russian armies and com­
manded by officers of the highest re­
nown.
Coincidental with llie arrival of
the Russians, comes the statement
from Paris that the Germans, owing
to the strong resistance of the French
at Verdun, are withdrawing large
forces from Russia, Serbia and Mace­
donia and throwing them into this
hotly contested theatre. iHere, the
French, according to the latest offi­
cial communications, have delivered
an attack near i'amort Homme,
northwest of VejjdlriV and succeeded
in driving the Germans out of por­
tions of a trench previously captured
by them. The Germans admit, the en­
try by the French of German trench­
es in the Caillette Wood, west of Ve
tux, after a heavy French attack, but
say that otherwise the attack was
repulsed with heavy attacks.
Ocupy British Positions.
Around Ypres, the Germans, ac­
cording to Berlin, attacked and occu­
pied 6,000 metres of (British positions.
The British official reports concede a
German gain here, but. says that ex­
cept two craters and one trench, near
St. 'Kloix, and on the Ypres-Lange
marck road, the Germans were ep
pelled from all the positions they cap­
tured.
In Asiatic Turkey, the Russians
are giving no rest to the Turks. The.v
now have dislodged tlieni from the
mountain passes south of Hit lis, and
pushed forward their forces toward

lies

southern Turkish army.
Heavy fightinK continues in the
Tehoruk region, where the 'Russians
are pressing forward in their attempt
to capture Baiburl and come into con­
tact with their army now occupying
Trebizond.
The Russian troops were given an
tremendous ovation as they marched
from the Quay to Boulevard Maritime,
where flags were Hying and vast
crowds had assembled. They pre­
sented a sturdy appearance as they
swung along, waving their hands in
answer to the enthusiastic cheering
of the populace. The men were
marched to a camp which had been
previously prepared for their recep­
tion, and which contains every con­
venience for camp life.
One of the happiest greetings they
received was the appearance of a
daily Russian newspaper

been started for their benefit of the
first news that Trebizond had been
captured by their brother soldiers in

Among other preparations for the
Russians, is a Russian church, simi­

Throughout the afternoon, great
crowds surrounded the camps and
kept up a continuous demonstration
of enthusiasm.

NATION AWAITS REPLY Fl
TO PRESIDENT WILSON'S FINAL WORD IN
Washington, April
manders.
Washington, April 20.—William
Jennings Bryan, former secretary of
state, who resigned because he
thought the president's policy in the
Lusitania case would lead to war,
came to Washington today.
"I was on my way to New Orleans
to deliver an address," he said, "when
the news reached me that a crisis In
the submarine controversy with Ger­
many had ar sen. I cancelled all en­
gagements ind hurried to Washing­
ton, not with any definite plan, but in
the hope that 1 could be of some as­
sistance in preserving peace.
"I am hoping for two things in this
present grave situation—first, that
Germany will accede, to the positions
of the United States, second, that if
she does not, diplomatic relations will
continue with a view to reaching an
amicable settlement of the trouble.
"We must remember that there is
nothing final between friends. A rup­
ture between this country and Ger­
many would indeed be unfortunate.
If lliis dispute should end in war, it
would be unspeakable.
"We are going to work to preserve
peace, if possible. Our plans are ten­
tative, and I cannot discuss them at
this time.
"The responsibility for declaring
war is upon congress, not. upon the
president," said Mr. Bryan tonight,
"and it. is fair to assume that when
the duty of acting falls upon con­
gress,, the president will be willing to
refrain from embarrassing congress,
as he was anxious that, he should not
be embarrassed."
Mr. Bryan declared if. would be a
crime for the United States to enter
the present war in any circumstances,
lie insisted that harm done Germany
by any of the belligerents had been
incident to their war in which the
United States was not. interested.
It was a false diplomacy, he declar­
ed, that was leading this country to­
ward war, and militarists and muni­
tion manufacturers were responsible
for it.

von Bernstorff, which he understood
the ambassador was ready to make to
his own government in guidance/of
their framing a reply to the American
note. The secretary was not dispos­
ed, however, to accept the views of
the ambassador as being official. He
was described authoritatively as 'be­

ambassador's own opinion and infor­

vent a break between his country and
the United States.
As a result of his conference. Count
von Bernstorff sent another commun*

It. was made clear at the German

did not expect to call upon Secretary
Lansing again until after his govern­

American note.
Just how long the tlnited States
