e au soris oi natnousm anu
manner.
At tho close of his nddrcss, which
was heartily applauded, President
Thomns snid he hoped if Dr. Hillegas
cver found Middlebury Collego stnnding
for a nnrrow or selfish policy, ho would
let him know by return mail. He also
said he was glad to hear him spenk of
"OurState," a privilego Vermonters
do not alwaysallow to new-comers.
Br. Hillegas spoke in part as follows:
"I cnn remember with considerablo
vividness the impression that men who
had been out of collego somc fifteen or
twenty vears used to mako unon us as
students when they came back and tried
to talk to us; and how we thought back
into the dim pnat as far as we could and
wondered just whnt conditions surround
ed them when they were working as we
were working at that time.
"Rememboring that, I hesitate some
what about venturing out upon any
thing in the way of advice, and yet one
feature of the talks that were given to
us ny men wtio nau neon out in tno
world has come back to me time and
time again. I think I never listened to
one'of those persons without getting a
stronger desire to get out into life, us we
used to put it.
"I want to take a somewhat diffcrent
point of view this morning, and to urge
upon you as students thatyou will never
be living any more than yiu are at the , D- . r
'present time. If Uiere is in the mind of "ICtUre rraming
any voung woman or young mnn before
me the notion that they ure proparing
for life by not living, I begof you to
change your notion. You are living
today. This is life. The didiculty arises
possibly from what may be taken as
more or less of un artificinl situation
within our colleges and universities. I
want to indicate very briefly one or two
of the key thoughts in actual living.
"I think I might take as my text the
offer that a good Vermonter made some
time ago nnd re-made within the past
five days a promise of $10,000 job to
just as many people as could qualify for
$10,000 positions. Now I wonder just
what that tnan has in mind as being
necessary in qualifying for such a large
position. I will venture to say that the
first thing that he wants is a conception
on the part of the candidate of relative
values. He does not want a person who
sees little things in t.ig ways and neglect
the big things of life. And again I
come back to the notion that right here
in your life, at the present time, you
have one of the best opportunities for
judging of relative values.
"If I had to go through my college
course again, nnd I say this after having '
had to deal with college students for a j
number of years, and graduate students i
at that, I would not take so seriously
what my instructors had to say. I mean j
thnt in all sincerity. I would have some
judgment of my own in rogard to what '
vvp wprn tnlkintr nlinnt. If it wpre I
History, Economics, or Mathematics,
or any of these subjects, I would form
some conclusions of my own. Now as I
understand it, that is one of the things
that you people can do right here in
you life at the present time
"I would knowsomething about the big
problems that were concerning man
kind. When we were studying the his
tory of Grccce, I would realize that
today the attention of the world is
attracted to certain problems concerned
with Greece at the present time.
In the second place, I would gather

MISSIONARY SOCIETY MEETING.
The 28th annual meeting of the
Woman's Foreign Missionary society of I would hav
the present time. I have been asked
on various occasions what my policy is,
or will be. I think I can give it in very
short terms.
"Some three years ago it was my
privilege to travel about a large portion
of the State. I may have met some of you
in your schools at that pnrticular time.
I found boys and girls of college quality
in what you people here are pleased to
term mountain towns.
"The big ambition that I have is to
mnke a very clenr path for the boy and
girl, no matter where they may be,
right down through the elementary
school, and high scliool, and through
college. I am fully awnre thnt no other
sities not to look at their problems as
almost personal, and while I ask your
sincerest backing in all of these matters
pertaining to educational matters of the
country, I pledge you in return my sin
cerest backing for the interests of your
own institution."
