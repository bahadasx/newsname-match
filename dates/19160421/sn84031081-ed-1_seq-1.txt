cessity of Carrying New
York as Part of Plan for
"Anything to Beat Wilson,"
)(Ct eOMNOW,C TO MOSMIN JOUSNAL
Washington, April 20. While the
tnlk fnvorable to Roosevelt has In
creased In the lust week, nevertheless
the sentiment (or Justice Hughe a
sentiment existing among the masse
has not diminished. The attempt of
Senator Works and other progressives
to "smoke out" Justice Hughes haH
not succeeded and he, with Colonel
Roosevelt, lends the republican rnce.
Republican leaders have come to a
full realization that the next cam
paign will he the most stubborn con
test the republicans have , had , for
years. They know their early posi
tion, "that any republican can beat
Wilson," Is idle talk, and are now
willing to name any one who can de
feat the president. If that man is
Roosevelt hn will be the nominee, but
the praeticnl leaders say he has great
elements of weakness, whereas Jus
tice Hughes Is conceded to be strong
er with a certain element than the ex
prealdenl because, among other
thlnprs, he is less militant.
,Tht keynote of the republican party
cannot be the tariff alone, as Senutor
Harding asserted In his speech In Chl
caso last week. The tariff, of course,
will' be a compelling Issue, but the
foreign policy will figure as never be
fore in a national campaign.
American menand women, too,
for the vole of American women will
count heavily In tho next presidential
electionare talking not about , the
tariff, but about Mexico and Germany.
And It In recognized that President
Wilson's position on both Mexico and
Oermany is finding hearty response
among n large proportion of the
Ameiican people. Mr. Wilson's policy
to avoid Intervention In Mexico, as
well as to avert nctual hostility with
Oermany, Is his strongest hold on
popular government.
It Is this frank recognition of Mr.
Wilson's strength with the voters that
makes the trend in the republican
party toward Mr. Hughes so strong,
because both Colonel noose volt and
Mr. Root have expressed sentiments
which 'ar Interpreted as a demand
for war. Humes insists on the nomi
nation of Hoot, and warns republicans
that they are unwise to stake repub
lican success on the possibility that
Hughes may accept the nomination.
His warning of collapse If Hughes
should refuse is n0t without force.
Strength of Roosevelt.
There will be at least a dozen, and
possibly even twenty delegates from
New York who will be devoted to
Roosevelt's Interests, ready to seize
any opportunity to stampede the con
vention for him, and certain of sup
port from Roosevelt men from the
west. Hut the great majority of New
York delegates are Hughes men, and
this fact Is emphasized because the
voice of Xew York must be heeded
In the next republican convention.
With Mr. Wilson's undoubted
length, it would be suicide to Ignore
Npw York as one of the most Import
ant factors in the problem of electing
a republican president. He it Koot,
Roosevelt, Hughes or any of the other
eandldates, the choice or the republi
can consensus must be a man who
will carry New York, for if the demo
crats carry New York they carry the
country.

and exclusive alo of Oklahoma, New
Mexico and Arizona, which have six
teen votes.
When the democrats have a candi
date who, unlike Mr. Bryan, Is really
In tho running, they always have a
splendid chance to carry these states.
The states are democratic In any pres
idential year in which Xew York is
republican by less than 50,000. Dela
ware and West Virginia, frequently
democratic, are In doubt.
Summing up these figures, when
the 126 votes of the solid south are
subtracted from the 266 votes neces
sary to select the president, there re
main HO votes, still needed. Subtract
from these 140 the thirty of Mary
land, Kentucky and Missouri; the six
teen of New Mexico, Arizona and Ok
lahoma, and the eleven of Delaware
and West Virginia, a total of Blxty-slx,
and there remain only seventy-four
electoral votes left.
Xew York, New Jersey- and Con
necticut almost invariably vote the
same way, Connecticut Is perhaps a
little less democratic than New York,
but New Jersey is u little more demo
cratic and might certainly be expect
ed to be more democratic, when Mr.
Wilson Is a candidate. These three
states together have sixty-six electoral
votes. Subtract their sixty-six votes
from the seventy-four and there re
main only eight votes needed for dem
ocratic victory. ,
Considering Indiana with Mr. Mar
shall the candidate for vice president
and two democratic senators to be
elected, it Is remembered that Its
electoral vote has gone with New
York in every presidential election
sinco Seymour ran against Grant.
Since then they have always traveled
side by side. Indiana has fifteen elec
toral votes, or seven more than- tho
democrats would need if they had
carried the states above enumerated.
Now York, therefore, Is the pivotal
state, and New York must not only be
content, but must be enthusiastic for
the man the republicans nominate at
Chicago. Without New York the

First Chief Plans to Curb by
Taxation Ownership of
Large Tracts of Land Bear
ing Precious Metals,
f MOaNIN. JOUHNAI. CIAI. lAHO Will
Mexico City, April 20. it was offi
cially announced today that Mexico's
new mining law will be made effec
tive within the next few days by a
decree to be Issued by General Car
ran za.
Tho most striking feature of the
new law will be Its discouragement of
large holdings' of undeveloped claims
for purposes of exploration or ex
ploitation. The present law does not
limit the number of claims which
may be denounced, and some of the
larger mining companies have as
many as 1,500, each claim represent
ing one hectalre or approximately two
and one-half acres.
The present government believes
that denouncements of excessive .!zs"
In the case of precious metals to be
detrimental to its interests, and Its is
expected that H consequently will put
what is believed to be a prohibitory
tax on such holdings.
Plan of Taxation.
The new schedule of taxes for re
gions bearing precious metals will be
based on minimum and maximum
holdings. The' first class will repre
sent the small mine owner holding ten
or less claims, who will be called upon
to pay an annual tax of ix dollars
Mexican gold, for each claim. in
second class reporesents the average
company, holding from ten to fifty
claims, from which an annual tax of
twelve dollars Mexican gold on encn
claim will be collected. The third
class represents the large companies
holding fifty to one hundred claims,
for which the new law provides a tax
of $18 a clat mannually in Mexican
gold.
Mining Men Differ.
Mining men are divided in opinion
as to the merits of the new law.
Many pronounce It eminently fair, and
say they will pay their tax with pleas
ure. Others declare that thousands of
claims now held by foreign corpora
tions will he given up and that as a
consequence the government will lose
a large amount of revenue, and that
the mining industry, which is by far
the most important in the county, will
receive a serious setback.
If is estimated here that the for
eign holdings effected by the law are
valued at more than $1,000,000,000 In
gold., the bulk of the holdings being
Amerioan, with large. British, French
and Belgian properties. The new law
also will Increase the export tax on
bullion from T 1-2 to 10 per cent. j

however, that a discussion of that

The ambassador called at the state

ready to make to his own govern-1

reply to the American note, The sec-
retary, however, was not disposed to
accept the views expressed by the
ambassador as being official. He was!
