T. A, Farrand, County
Agent, Makes Valuable
Suggestions for Benefit
of the Fruit Growers.
The practice of spraying is, with the
growing of moat kinds of fruits, the con
necting link between success and fail
ure. While different methods are some
times followed by different fruit growers
the principle which underlie the pract
ice of spraying are the same. Thorough
ness in application and the proper time
with the proper mixture, rre very im
portant points in spraying. Inasmuch
as spraying, especially in the control of
all fungus diseases, is not a cure, but a
method of prevention, to get the best
results, it is very important to "get there
first" and then keep the fruit and foliage
covered through the season. At this
3eaeon of the year, in the dormant stage
is the time to control the San Jose bcale
on nearly all the different kinds of fruits
and curl leaf on the peach, both of
which can be done with the same appli
cation. I have always used, for tde e-cale spray,
1 to 7 of limesulpnur, that would test 33
baume test. The dry lime sulphur or
aoluable lime Hulphur is coming in use
more and more and for scale is recom
menced at 12 2' pounds to 50 gallons of
water, or 1 pound to 60 gallons of water
when foliage is out. Where tne scale is
not present in the peach orchard, and
the curl leaf aloue is being treated, 1 to
20 pounds of lime and 'sulphur will give
satisfactory results. In the orchard that
is badly infested with the scale, very
thorough work is necessary to get it
under control, as it. is n insect of suck
ing type and must be kill d by contact.
One can see very resdil) that every one
must be touched with the spray ID order
to destroy it, and to touch all parts of
the surface of the bark rtuuires very
careful work.
1 have followed the practice in orchards
of that kind of spraying from both sides
of the trees, and going both was in the
orchards. By doing it very thoroughly
with this method, which is more than
most growers do, 1 have been able to
get the scale under complete control in
a single season in very badly infested
orchards. Two points that are very apt
to be missed in spraying, are the new
growths in tha tops of the trees, and the
points nearest the sprayer. In spraying
for the green aphis, our State Entomo
logist, R. H. Pettit, does not r commend
the use of the nicotine solutions in con
nection with the strong lime-sulphur
spray, but recommends it use either
alone, or with the weaker solution of
lime-sulphur, 1 to 40 or 50 when the pink
begins to show in the blossoms, using
one and one half pints of black leaf to
40 to 200 gallons. If used alone, 4 pound
soap should be disolved and used to help
to make it stick.
The aphis has proved to be a serious
pest in the last few years with the apple
growers but if taken at the proper time
there is no reason why the nicotine solu
tions should not control them. Many
growers are using the scale spray as late

an they can before the blossoms BOWS
out, ar.d are well satisfied with the re
suits, however, claiming sometimes they
buru the edges of the foliage a little
with the full strength solution. Person
ally, I hn i nlways given the scale ppray
from the tirst to the middle of April,
and then been very sure to give a spray
when the apples begin to show the pink
in the blossoms and the blossoms were
opened up so I could protect the Utile
stems with the weaker spray solution,
using one gallon of lime and sulphur to
40 or 50 of water. If in an orchard
where leaf eating insects are ueceesary
to control, add the arsenate of lead, I or
3 pounds to 50 gallons of solution.
After five years experience in spraying
with lime and sulphur for apples, 1 would
not give a cent a pound for blue vitriol
to control the apple scab fungus 1 have
gotten the very best of results with the
lime and sulphur solutions and avoiJ
the russeting of the fruit which we used
to get when using the bordeau mixture
through the season.

County Agent.

SOME MINSTREL SHOW
DeKue Brothers Mintrels
were exceptionally good
and everybody was well
pleased
The minstrel show given Wednesday
evening at the Longwell opera house,
under the direction of the DeKue
Brothers was the real thing and made a
bit with everyone present. The first
part was the usual circle of black faces
all beaming with animation, (no dead
ones present.) The songs were some of
the latest and the jokes above the aver
age in cleverness and brought forth
much laughter from the audience. The
second pare consisting of the various
stunts of clever performers did not lag
one minute from start to finish. The
dancing and acrobatic stunts show
ed that they were executed by stars.
The quartet of varied personalities made
the hit of the evening and were obliged
to respond to encore after encore. The
flashy boy was sure some child. All in
all it was the best show of its kind that
we have had iu our city for a long time.

TEACHERS EXAMINA
TIONS IN PAW PAW
Teachers KxHminatinr.s will to be held
at Paw Paw April 27th 28th and re
quirements for obtaining a cartiticate
have been changed in two ays. A law
passed bv the last legislature makes a
term at a Normal school or a half year
in college a necessary condition for ob
taining a certiticate; in other words a
high school graduate must attend a
summer term at a state normal before a
certificate can be obtained.
The other change relates to the grant
ing of a renewal of a certificate previous
ly granted and it is explained in this
letter which is sent out to members of
the boards of examiners by the Super
intendent of Public Instruction.
Lansing 3-24-1916.
To County Boards of School Examiners:
To promote professional training and
to encourage a more adequate prepara
tion of teachers the Department of Pub
lic Instruction recommends that candi
dates for renewal of county certificates
shall file for each renewal four advanced
credits (12 weeks work in each subject
from a State Normal or other approved
school. This requires two six weeks'
terms or one 12 weeks terra.
It is farther recommended that for
those whose certificates expire this year,
two credits (twelve weeks work in each
subject) be aubstituced for the above
requirement.
Yours Very Truly,
Pred L. Keeler.

REPUBLICANS MET
IN CONVENTION
Delegates to District and
State Convention Se
lected at Hartford Last
Tuesday.
The republican county convention
was held at Hartford last Tuesday, when
delegates were elected to attend the
fourth congtessional district convention
to be held at Niles next Tuesday, and
the state convention at Lansing, May 3.
U nder the county call the convention
was entitled to 1l6 delegates, whereas
there were but 06 delegates seated in
the convention. K. W. Broughton,
chairman of the county committee,
called the convention to order and called
lie . Lynn J . Lewis to the chair as tem
porary chairman. Mr. Lewis responded
with a ringing republican speech, which
met the approval of the convention. C.
M. -Jennings of Lawrence was made tem
porary secretary. Committees on cre
dentials and permanent organization
and order of business were appointed
and the convention adjourned until after
dinner.
The only contest in the convention
wae over the adoption uf the report of
committee on permanent organization
and order of business One clause of
the report provided that in the selec
tion of delegates the roll of townships
be calleil alphabetically instead of nu
merically us has been the custom. An
other clause provided that delegates to
the state ar d district conventions might
be selected from any part of the county
regardless of the precinct they were to
represent.
ii. h Warner offered an amendment
that the roll should be called according
to ihe numerical strength of the pre
cincts and led the li;ht for the amend
ment, h. (j. Davis of Lawton, who was
a member of tn.e committee and who
stated that he had written the report,
led the tight in opposition to the amend
ment. On the vote the original clause
relative to roll call carried. Chas. Rob
inson of Lawrence then offered an
amendment which provided that dele
gates must be residents of the precincts
from which they are selected. Mr. Rob
inson and Mr. Warner championed the
amendment and Mr. Davis fought for
the original report. i tie amendment
carried and all delegates were selected
from the precincts they were to repre
sent. At the conclusion of the business of
the c invention and just prior to ad
joumment, Wm. C Mosier offered a
resolution favoring the state dry cam
paign. There was no discussion of the
resolution and it carried without op
position. iSome in the convention
did not vote, and while it is probable
that percent, if not more, of those
present favor the state wide prohibitory
amendment and will vote for it next
fall, yet there was a sentimect, both
from a political and prohibition stand
point, that the resolution should not
have been brought before the conven
tion. Following are the delegates elected to
attend the district convention at Niles,

FUNERAL OF LAMFNTED
MRS. PES VOIGNES
The last sad rites were pnid to th
memory of Mrs. L. B. Des Voignes at
her beautiful home in Cassoplis last
Sunday afternoon at 2:30. The laige
gathering of loving and sympathetic
friends from her girlhood home of Men
don also from Marcellus, Dowagiac,
Kalamazoo and Paw Paw and the old
friends and neighbors in Cassopo'is, the
home of Mr. and Mrs. Des Voigoes
gave evidence of the respect and high
esteem in which she was held.
The room in which Mrs. Des Voignes
slept was a bower of beautiful (lowers,
silent tokens of the love of sorrowing
friends there assembled to bid farewell
to one that they knew had alwajs been
a kind and faithful friend to many. She
was a person to make friends by the
Bcore and to hold that friendship forever
sacred. The solo, "A Perfect Day" was
sung at her request and the "Good Bye"
song at the request of the broken heart
ed husband, with whom she has traveled
the "Ups and Downs" of life's fitful
journey for the past thirty years, both
meetings its sorrows and sunshine to
gether. Now the fond husband is left
alone to make the rest of the journey
without the aid of her kindly words of
encouragement and assistance.
Kev. E. H. Harvey spoke in beautiful
and touching words of her life among us
and elsewhere. About one hundred from
here attended the funeral. Mr. Des
Voignes has the heart felt sympathy of
all In this the hour of his great sorrow.
