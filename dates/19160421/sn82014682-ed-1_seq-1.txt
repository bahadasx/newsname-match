President Wilson over the provision
in the pending immigration bill
which proposes to enact into laW
the so-called "gentlemen's agree
ment" by which Japan now re
stricts her laborers from coming to
the United States. A memoran
dum embodying the objections of
Japan to this feature of the bill was
filed by Ambassador Chinda. . V
It is understood that other pro
posedfeatures of the bill dealing
with Asiatic exclusion have been
found objectionable by Japan. The
bill has' passed the house and been
favorably reported 'to the senate,
carrying, the Asiatic exclusion pro
visions. '. ! ",' -- :
The attitude of the administra
tion is understood to be a disincline
ation , to irritate Japan for obvious
"reasons, and the hope that the un

TOKIO, Japan, April 21. Genera
Chang Tauo Lin has been appointed
governor of Mukden province. Chang
is one of the ardent supporters of

LuTsug Yu, Chinese . minister to

that the trouble In China will not

An entirely new Rapid Transit fran

The plan is. to abandon the efforts

of the company, the commission and

that the disposition of the company.

SCHOFIELD'S BIG
Target Practise Gives Specta
tors Some Idea of Modern
v Bombardment
f.8pdal SUr-Sanatla Odtrespeadeaee
v SCHOFIELD IMIfACKS, April 21.
One of the mostinteresting occur
rences at ; Schold this week has
been the target practise of Battery
C with the big 4.7-lnch siege rifles,
throwing 60-pound shell and shrapnel
at targets 7500 to S000 yards away,
about four and a half nftles. v
- Two problems were fired by Capt
J. W. Kllbreth, Jr.. on Tuesday, the
firing point being near Wahiawa nnd
ihe targets at the foot of the Waianae
range. The trajectory passed about a
half mile over the county road, but
by a system of signals the guns were
not fired while any automobiles or
wagons were traveling along the road
in front of the guns. The screech of
the shells could be heard at Schofleld
and sounded as if they were passing
difectly oyer the post, though the line
of fire was more than a quarter of a
mile away from the buildings.
One of: the targets was a target
butt cf the old rifle range, which was
assumed to represent an enemy's
trench. Of the Iff shells fired at this
target, two by their delayed action
fuse burst over the trench and one
pierced the parapet and burst as It
entered the trench, after boring its
way through 10 feet of earth. -
Yesterday Lieut. Bertram Frankeh
berger and Lieut J. O. 'Daly were
given platoon problems, with the fir
ing point at the entrance to Castnr.
Gen. Wisser and many officers from
the coast artillery posts were out to
see the practise and there waa a large
fathering of officers and soldiers from
the Schofleld regiments. , .
Battery C is one of the two bat
teries In the United States army
equipped with the 4.7-inch siege rifles
Yesterday afternoon a problem was
conducted for Gen. Wisser, In which
the 1st and 25th Infantry regiments
advanced in.dlffertmt tvpes of forma
tion against a simulated artillery fire.
The burst of the shrapnel was repre
sented by smoke bombs and gave a
very realistic effect.
Printed copies of all important com
munications and other matters here
after will be sent to the members of
the Chamber of Commerce for their
consideration before thev are taken
up at meetings. A mimeograph, re
cently purchased by the chamber, will
be used In this connection.

Deposition of Sam Parker Tells
of Conversation With Queen '
Seven Years Ago V
.: Testimony of Samuel Parker, taken
at his residence at Waikiki last Fri
day afternoon In the examination by
Attorney D. U Withington, and cross
examination by Attorney Clarence H.
Olson, was filed in circuit court today
by Judge T. B. Stuart.
The testimony was taken to perpet
uate evidence in the suit brought by
J. K. Kalanian.iole to break the trust
In which the property of Queen LIU
uokalani is held. It was taken at the
home of Mr. Parker as the witness
was too feeble to appear in court
Though consisting of several pages
the typewritten manuscript is made
up considerably more of arguments by
the attorneys than by the evidence It
self.; . v.--,:'; :Am,y' ,'..
So feeble was the aged witness
found in the course of testimony that
the court ruled that leading questions
might be asked, stating that "the wit
ness is very feeble and it is impos
sible to make him understand, as the
court plainly sees." v
Questions hinged around a visit
which Mr. Parker had paid to the
queen while she was stopping at the
Hotel Stewart in San Francisco in
1909, and concerning which he is al
leged to have filed a statement on No
vember 24, last The statement,
signed in his name, follows:
'1 left Honolulu on the steamship
Korea oh Thursday, December 21,
1909, in company with my children,
and on board the same vessel at the
time was Prince Kuhio and his wife.
Immediately, upon arrival in San Fran
cisco on the 27th of the said month, I
went to the Stewart Hotel and en
gaged quarters there.
"I learned upon arriving there that
Queen Liliuokalani was also staving
there and so on the next day I called
on her. to pay my respects. I met the
queen In her apartments and spent
considerable time over different top
ics.; All of a.sudden she asked me if
I knew she had signed a deed of trust
parting with all her property and the
disposition of it she saw fit and I said
to her I heard such was the case and
it had been printed In the papers. She
Immediately said to me she did not
sign 'a trust deed but had made a will
and Mr. Damon and Mr. Cecil Brown
were the witnesses to It

In the short time that he has been

' Consul Moroi is studying the local
situation for himself, and although re
ports are received from others he
finds greater satisfaction in forming
an Idea from personal visits. The
Japanese representative has a hobby
of taking strolls to different parts of
the city and in these walks he has
learned many things that are certain
to be useful to him in the future.
