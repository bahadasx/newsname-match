A derailment of nineteen cars
three miles this side of North Strat
ford badly crippled the freight and
passenger traffic between this point
and Portland last Sunday and Mon
day. A train of 46 loads left here
about 11 o'clock Sunday morning,
with Hy Wentworth conductor, and
Lee Corliss engineer; nineteen cars
left the track at the curve this side
of tho Stone dam, the cause of which
is unknown. Seventeen of the de
railed cars were loaded with wheat,
one with oats and one empty. So
badly were some of the cars damaged
that it was impossible to account for
several of them, they being broken
into splinters and nothing remaining
but the trucks. Fifteen cars were
piled one on top of another within
two telegraph pole lengths. It was
the ninth car from the engine which
seems to have caused the damage.
Brakeman Deance was riding this
car and escaped without injury by
jumping into the main road which is
fully thirty feet from the track
The wrecking crew worked Sunday
afternoon and night, finally making
a clearance so as to permit the Mon
day noon trains to pass through.
Then He Said Good-by.
Mr. Chumpleigh "I say, I wonder
how a chap could live without brains,
dontcherknow?" Miss Caustique
(yawning) "How old are you?"
