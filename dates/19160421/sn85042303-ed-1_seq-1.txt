necessity continued today.
The troops at the front are
awaiting Washington develop
ments before chasing Villa fur
ther. American Supplies Held Up.
El Paso, Tex., April 21. Reports
are being received here that ship
ments of hay from Juarez to Chihua
hua for use by the American troops,
are being held up by Carranza au
thorities. The Mexican officials de
clare that this is due to lack of avail

There is less attempt in army cir
cles than heretofore to disguise the
feeling of the Americans with ref
erence to "Carranza cooperation" in
Mexico.

Chicago, 111., April 21. The Quaker
Oat company is not operating in vio
lation of the Sherman law, according
to a decision today by the judges of

petitive conditions were restored be

controlled ninety per cent of th5 oat
meal business of the I'nited S'r.es.

DR. WILLIAMS DELIVERED MOST
PRACTICAL SERMON LAST
NIGHT EVANGELIST IN HAPPY
MOOD CHORUS EFFECTIVE.
The sermon by Dr. M. 1!. Williams
it the tabernacle last night was be
yond (piestiun the best and most prac
tical one he lias delivered in Ardmore
I The tabernacle was conil'oi tably filled
land the interest was far above what
1 it lias been at any time during the
I meeting. The evangelist was in a
I happy mood and delivered his sennou
with considerable energy and em
phasis. He fully demonstrated his
statement of the night before that
"iike preacher, like congregation" as
he had not talked more than five min
utes until the entire congregation was
in the same happy, but earnest mood
possessed by the evangelist.
1'receding the sermon the best song
service of the meeting was led by
Prof. H. J. Uray, who was in the
same frame of mind as the evangel
ist. The leader, the chorus, t he preach
ers and the congregation were all de
monstrative of optimism and good
cheer. The evangelists stated that they
never conducted a meeting where the i
first week indicated great success more
than this one. The evening prayer
was offered by Rev. Masters of the
Oklahoma liaptist University, located
at Shawnee. Rev. Masters was for
merly pastor of the liroadway liaptist
church of this city. Rev. Williams an
nounced that tonight he would con
duct the first after-meeting of the re
vival. At t lis service full and com
plete instructions will he delivered to
all workers of the meeting. It is there
lore necessary that all persons know
ing themselves to be on committees,
be present and remain for the after
meeting. Tlie service for ladies only
will be conducted tomorrow afternoon
at 2:30 instead of 3 o'clock. There
will be services Saturday night as
usual. Sunday morning at 11 o'clock
Dr. Williams will deliver the Easter
sermon, on the subject "The Fact of
Christ and Is He Risen?" Sunday af
ternoon there will be a special service
for young people and children, and the
evangelist's topic will be, "Where
Uirls and Hoys Play in the Street."
Sunday night the sermon will be es
pecially interesting to business and
professional men and last night Dr.
Williamson gave a special invitation
to them to attend this service. He
stated that he hoped the Business I
Men's Association would see fit to at-!
tend in a body.
Mark 2:24 and was chosen for
the text, last night, and the fo'lowing
statements are a few of the good i
things said by Dr. Williams in his ser-1
nion: "My sermon tonight is not so !
much on prayer as it is on one of the J
principal hindrances to prayer, b. ing i
an unforgiving or revengeful sDirit.
Churches and families have been split j
in twain where hate has come into
them. Even neighborhoods are divid-1
ed because of unforgiving spirit. Ha- i
tred is like a cancer. It grips about I
the heart and strangles out lite. Hatred
is just sucli a cancer upon the body
politic, the body ecclesiastical, and
the domestic life of families. Three-

the French press on President Wil

summarized in these words, printed
in the Petit Parisien: "Never has the

WHEAT AND CORN DROP
ON GERMAN ULTIMATUM
Kansas City, .Mo., April 2H. The
wheal market on the Kansas City
hoard of trade could not withstand
the sensational news from Washing
ton to the effect that President Wilson-had
sent an ultimatum to Ger
many, and the market tool; a drop of
2 cents. Corn followed suit with a
decline of 1 cent.
Should there he a break with Ger
many it is predicted by traders on
the local market that t lie board of
trade will experience lively times,
such as came at the outbreak of the
war, when wheat prices fluctuated
from 5 to 10 cents a day. In the
event of an international breacli it
is expected that there will be a de
cided break in the market.

What might have been a serious
accident was narrowly averted last
night when the front wheel of a
swiftly moving automobile gave way
on the Chickasaw lake road, causing
the car to somersault, precipitating
the four occupants to the ground.
The car was driven by Kirk Morgan
and occupied by Stanley Cox, John
Varnell and Frank Cleek. The boys
went for a drive after the show last
night, and were returning to the city
from the lake, when a front tire
blew out, causing the wheel to cave,
with the above result.
Morgan and Ch ek escaped without !
a scratch, hut Varnell and Cox were
badly bruised and shaken up, though
no bones were broken. The injured
were taken to the Hardy Sanitarium

One of the largest crowds ever as

IRE GERMANS

man's Hill last night. Paris
says the French also repulsed
the Germans in Haudremont
Wood region last night.

fantry fighting continues today

defended by the Turks.
