Memorandum Presented To

ORIENTALS RESENT
PART OF MEASURES
Exclusion Features Cause
Viscount Qhinda To Seek
Conference.
L Washington, April 21. viscount
Chinda, the Japanese . ambassador,
conferred with President Wilson to-(
day over the t provision of the pending
immigration bill which ' proposed to
enact into law the so-called gentle
man's agreement restricting the im
migration of Japanese laborers. a
memorandum on the subject has been
presented: to the itate department.
The ". proposed s inclusion in a law of
an Insular agreement which Japan has'
promised to fulfill, . according to agree
ment between former Secretary Root
and former Ambassador Takahira, is
understood to be repugnant to the
Japanese government. .Other -proposed
Asiatic exclusion features f in the bill
as: It passed the -House and has been
reported to the Senate are understood
to be the subjects of objection.
For many obvious reasons the atti
tude of the administration ' is said to
be one of disinclination to irritate the
situation between Japan and the Unit
ed States which has been unsettled
since the California and alien land
law negotiations went into an indefi
nite stake three years ago.
Administration officials are not un
mindful ofj an ti-Asiatic sentiment In
congress, particularly among uitym--bers
from the Pacific otfStst states and
theftr constant endeavor has-been ' to
allay it.
The United States lias replied to
Japan's . last note on t the . California
land law. ' The last, that was said on
the subject-was said by former Secre
tary Bryan r to : -Ambassador - Ohinda
whew' the -negotiations went Into the
state of- apparent deadlock, and the
ambassador, on taking his departure
from a conference at Secretary Bry
an's office inquired; if ''he were to transmit-the
last word of the United States
to- his government. To that Secretiary
Bryan replied: : . ' S.'
"There never can toe a, last word be
tween frien'ds. i .
One jrtion .of the" to-ill -which" is un
derstood , to : draw the resentment of
the- Japanese, government is 'the in
clusion, toy inference at least, of Jap
anese in the excluded class with Hin
dus, although "tho same paragraph of
the bill expels from ..he exclusion . such
as are covered in "existing ' . agree
ments."' This phrase 1 refers to the
Jtoot-Takafaira agreement. -

The pursuit of the ihot cross bun
was temporarily forgotten this morn
ing when the professional 'baseball sea
son was opened in this city toy an ex
hibition toetween Bridgeport of the
Eastern league and Newark of the In
ternational leagaie. Newark won a
well nlaved contest toy 1 to 0 after a
Phard struggle. In spite of the fact
that the local players -have been prac
ticing onlya few days while Newark
has been getting into condition for
two weeks, the Bridgeport represen
tatives made the game interesting all
the way.
iiOst of the players on the Bridge
port club were new to the fair sized
crowd of spectators who witnessed
the game. Many of them were signed
before Harry Corn en and Gus Knorr
-bought th'e club last week. It looks
as ' if there Would toe several first class
men in -the equad, however. . The ma
terial on hand will toe given a trial
and when the new manager is signed
next week he will, take steps to get the
players he needs.
. Kingston, who pitched tfhe first five
innings for Bridgeport, made a good
Impression.' He .held Newark score
less and gave tout four, hits- The
youngster, is toik and has an easy-delivery.
,: Martin, purchased' from
Lynn, -Mass., twirled the last four inn
ings. He gave two hits and allowed
the only run of the game, tout made a
fine showing nevertheless. . .
Of the other Bridgeport players Out
fielders Edwards and' Moshier and
Third Baseman Byrne seemed most
promising. ' Moshier, who" is a . loea4
boy, obtained two hits while Edwards
and Byrne each got. one.
George Crook, who was a member
of the-local club ln1914, caughtNthe
entire-game for Bridgeport, He. threw
out ' two runners who taied to steal
second.
The Newark club1! is -under , the man
agement- of Kredr- Tenney, who . for
merly played with Boston and. New
Tork in the National .league, -..The
international leaguers proved to be
steady .'fielders but could noi gather
match nourishment from ' the local
pitchers. Enzman, one of the veteran
Newark pitchers, travelled the entire
nine innings." He was stingy with hia
nits," letting Bridgeport nave only 'five.

i i '.--, ; : . :
The ocean-going steamship Ramos,
formerly the British steamer Koxhall
of Newcastle-ori-Tyne, , but which was
changed to United States registry in
1912, arrived in the harbor of. Bridge
port this morning with a cargo of en
gines and equipment consigned to the
Lake Torpedo , Boat Co. . Though no
Deport of the vessel's clearance from
New York was made in the maritime
records this " morning, theT Ramos is
said to have left there last night. It is
believed that she is N under charter
from Norfolk. '
Little information could toe obtained,
at the Lake Torpedo Boat plant which
is partly closed- today, as to the nature
of . the cargo. It is .understood there
that the full equipment for the sub-
amrihe L-4 and other boats of that
class being built for the United States
government is included in the caro. '
Toole & Sunderlin's derrick Was en
gaged in lightering the cargo as the
Ramos is of such size as to prevent
her coming within, the harbor beyond
the confines of -the 2 3 -foot channel.
She is the first foreign built vessel to
enter "the harbor in many years and
one of the first ocean-going steamers
to co'me within the breakwater within
five years. ! - ,
On a recent trip from abroad the
Ramos is said to -have been attacked
by a submarine, but to have escaped.
The maritime records 'show her to be
190 feet in length with a gross tonnage
of 843 tons.
A rumor about the waterfront
credits her future course as direct
from this port to San Francisco with
parts for the submarines now being
buSt toy the Lake Torpedo Boat Co. in
California. This could not toe confirm
ed today. -

The delay in summoning the medi

The rescue was the fourth that Ber

which has been used in rescuing 15
others in a like manner.
It was shortly after 12 o'clock when
cries 'resounded from the foot of Wall
