State Department Announces
that Demands Will Not Be
Lessened in the Slightest.
RULES MUST BE KEPT
Lansing Explains Note Is Mere
ly a Reiteration of Stand
in Ultimatum Form.
BREAK STILL IS IMMINENT
U. S. Requires Germany to Abandon
the Illegal Methods of Sub War
fare Used at Present.
While the threat of a break in rela
tions with Germany still remains, the
situation was made to appear lees men
acing by official explanation yesterday.
The State Department made it plain
that no new demands have been made
upon Germany. What has been done is
to renew the former demands in a form
approaching an ultimatum.
At the same time it was officially
brought out that the United States is
ready and willing to negotiate with Ger
many for peaceful settlement of the con
troversy.
Explanations made by the highest
State Department authority yesterday
presented the situation as follows:
First, that the United States demands
of Germany only that she declare and
put into effect an abandonment of illegal
methods of submarine warfare. There is
no demand that she shall abandon her
submarine warfare entirely.
Second, that the United States will be
satisfied if Germany puts into opera
tion in the British war zone the subma
rine method, employed in the Mediter
ranean, and will accept pledges to do so
as a means of avoiding a break.
This leaves the decision up to Germany
as it was before, but It clarifies the situ
atlsa by making plain the fact that the
door is still open for diplomatic nego
tiations.
Saw Two Interpretatiema.
The explanation came after a visit to
the State Department yesterday of Count
Non Bernstorff, the German Ambassador.
The Ambassador is understood to have
told Secretary Lansing that the Presi
dent's note to Germany could be Inter
preted either as demanding an end of
submarine warfare against all vessels of
commerce, or as demanding abandon
ment only of illegal warfare.
It was later authoritatively announced
at the State Department that the note
meant what It said, that "present meth
ods" of submarine warfare be abandoned.
Ti're was no warrant, it was declared.
for the interpretation placed on the note
iv some press associations and newspa
per-. which construed it as meaning a
.!euand for cessation of all submarine
arfare.
The United States is contending for
ne condict of submarine warfare in
onformity with international law," it
was stated at the department. "This
has been our position from the first."
It was added that legal submarine
warfare would require Germany to ex
ercise the right of visit and search and
a wouid require submarines to make ab
solute provision for the safety of pas
engers and crews before attacking any
Teasels.
state Department officials made It ab
colutely clear that the United States has
not changed one iota from the position
announced by the President in his note
and message. The demands have not
tees lessened in the slightest degree.

New York, April 20.-An expert me

the Federal building and police head

and munitions factories at St. Catherines,
Ontario, and at other towns in Canada
and the United States, were frustrated
when Harry L. Newton was arrested to
day at Grand street and the Bowery by
Detective Sergeant George D. Barnits.
Newton, who is 42 years of age, and a
citizen of the United States, had so thor
oughly committed himself in conversa
tion with Barnitz, who hadt been dicker
ing with him in the pretended capacity
of a German secret agent, that he did not
hesitate to make a confession to Capt.
Thomas Tenney at police headquarters
after his arrest today.
His case presents rather a new angle in
the general spy situation. Newton does
not pretend to have any sympathy for
the G ertman cause, or any animosIty
toward the British or their allies. He
was merely greedy for money and was
ready to attempt almost any hasardous
adventure if he could get his price
For $5,000 in cash he was ready to ex

President Wilson put the German issue,

Mrs. Wilson was radiant with the ex

game in the Presidential box as the First
Lady of the Land and her smiles made
everybody near enough to see them feel
that it was indeed a gala day.
