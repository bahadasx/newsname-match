enlnir about seven o'clock, saying he
bad killed a man. Also A. L. Woodley
and J. R. Moore were in the auto of
Bill Hudson the killing having occurr
ed three miles north of the headquar
ters ranch of Hudson at a well owned
by Al Woodley.
Neither the accused nor his at
torneys, Messrs. Osburn Robinson,
would talk of the homicide and all
that could be learned was gleaned
from the evidence taken at the coro
ner's inquest which was commenced
as soon as the justice of the peace
F. H. Richards, could impanel a jury.
rThe Jury was composed of the fol
lowing! W. R. Owen, Jno. Merchant,
J. F. Flowers, 8am B. Smith, H. C.
Sands. L. E. Hyatt.
After viewing the body, the jury was
excused until Saturday morning wher
the following witnesses were examin
ed! Bryan Lane, A. L. Woodley, L.
E. Burt, J. R. Moore, Buck Gholson,
Al Williamson, Tom Tiner and Doe
Coates.
The principal evidence was given
by Bryan Lane, the brother of the de
ceased who testified that he and his
brother drove into camp from a point
at which they were making prepara
tions to drill a well having hauled an
engine and load of tools, etc., about
- - - - .-J AHa.kalf mi!., Mint til
Woodley. ranch at which the party
were camped, as they were stopping at
the Woodley ranch where they had
leased the right to water a herd of
horses. When they drove into the
Woodley camp at which is located a
tent and well with wind mill, Mr.
Ira and Bryan Lane started to un
hitch the mules. Lasaetter came out
of the tent and conversed some with
the Lanes.
, Ira was in the act of placing a
rope over the neck of one of the
mules when Lasaetter, . who had an
automatic ahot gun, shot Ira Lane
apparently killing him instantly. Bry
an started to run after the first shot
of which four were fired, but Lasset-
ftred at him as he ran. Mr. Wood
then came out of the tent and said
to Lasaetter: "What the h are
you doing?" Lasaeter answered: "1
nave kilted them both, and am glad
of it."
Woodley then left to go to the
neighbors for assistance and Lasset
ter after Woodley departed, went out
to where Bryan Lane was lying
wounded and threw down on the
ground a Colt's six shooter that was
the property of Bryan Lane. Bryan
then raised up and begged Lasaeter
not to shoot him again and as Bryan
remarked in his testimony: "I talked
him out of it." Bryan Lane then
aaid: "What did you do it for?" and
lassetter answered: "You know that
you and your brother had framed up
to beat me out of my interest in the
horses and three years' hard work."
Bryan than told Lasaetter that he
had never talked or heard of such
a plan. Then Lasaetter helped Bryan
into the tent and dressed his wound.
It developed that Lassetter had a
contract with Lane to care for a num
ber of horses for a period of Ave
years and had looked after them for
three years and the last two of which
he held the horses in a pasture in
Texas about forty miles south of
where the tragedy occurred and the
contract was of record in Texas. The
grass becoming scarce in the pasture,
it was decided to move tht horses
to where'there was more grass and
water was secured from Mr. Woodley
and th horses were running around
the camp of Woodley. Ira Lane-, who
from all reports, was some of a prac
tical Joker, is said to have told Las
setter that as the contract was re
corded in Texas he intended to take
the hOraea from Lasaetter as he now
had no right to them. Lassetter be
lieved he waa to be dlsposaeaaed and
it la believed by many rather than
loae his three years labor he shot
Ira Lane. This is the report that is
how prevalent and as near the facts
as it possible to obtain at present for
the accused will not talk and his
attorneya refuse to allow any state
ment to originate from him or any one
of his family. Mrs. I.assatter waa in-
f terviewed aNsVsaid it would be bent
1 to see the attorneya. However, she
, stated that her hnaband had cared
T for the horses In Tefat some forty
J miles south for the past two years.
I The coroner's Jury, after listening to
I all evidence that could bo eliciUd

for the state, Mr. At wood, who was
here in place of the district attorney,

ters ranch and gave up to Buck Ghol
son. The killing to many is a mys
tery at the men had never been known
to nava words or quarrel in any way
and there seems to be no apparent
cause for the homicide. Some think

that more evidence will develop at

HOME AND SCHOOL ASSO
CIATION ENTERTAINMENT.
The program Riven by the Home
and School Association Friday even
ing proved to be one of the best
given. The characters from the var
ious countries were well represented,
the eustoms and ways being well
demonstrated by various ladies. Car
ry Nations was there from the court"
of Heaven and as the Current and
Argus reporters passed to their places
she made war on them with her hatch
et knocking one of their cigarettes
to the floor.
The maid from Japan favored the
audience with the song," A Little Maid
From Japan".
The representative from Africa with
Snow Ball waa ona of the pleasing
features of the evening. Snow Ball
did some good dancing and her fond
mother cheered her with loving words
and glance.
The suffragette convention ended
by the ladies fussing about the men.
"Here's a Fly" by Gloria Jackson,
and Bob McCollum, waa suitable for
tho occasion as was the two fly swat
drills by the small girls of the gram
mar gradea. They were perfect in
their drills and very pretty and attrac
tive in their costumes and each girl
carried a fly swat.
The Bunch orchestra furnished the
two or three numbers and the music
waa of the very choicest selections.
The addresses given by Messrs.
Grantham and Armstrong were very
encouraging to the ladies who are
entering the combat with the fly. The
solos, one by Miss Ines Hatfleld, Mrs.
Ralph and Bert Rawlins, were excep
tionally good and being heartily en
cored responded.
The male quartet gave a number and
were called again.
WOMAN'S CLUB.
The Woman's club met Tuesday af
ternoon and various items of interest
were diacuaaed.
Mra. Will Kocher resigned as re
cording secretary and Mrs. Durham
wat elected to fill her place. The club
decided to have a picnic two weekt
from Tueeday. An arrangement com
mittee is to co -ope rate with the social
committee to select a place and de
cide en the refreshments.
Home and School Association wilt
co-operate with the Woman's club in
the fly campaign. The Home and
School Association voted $10 and re
reived 111 from the entertainment,
making 121 they gave toward the flv
campaign. The club voted $54 more
making a total of $75 toward this
work. More funds will be needed if
Carlsbad Is to be a flyleea town. Why
not everyone help these two organi
sations in their enterprise by swatting
flies and begin now!
Mrs. Hemenway had charge of the
program which conaiated of a number
of very intdresting pnpera on Mexico
and the peons by Meadames Snow,
Kocher, Ra rey and Durham.

NO IMMEDIATE DECISION FOR
WITHDRAWAL OF U. S. TROOPS
FROM MEXICO IS LOOKED FOR.
With Pursuit of Villa at Standstill
Washington Propoeea to Allow Pun
itive Expedition lo Mark Time Un
leaa Anil-American Outbreak Com
pela Action.
Washington, April 19. No decision
as to the withdrawal of American
troops from Mexico it expected for a
week or ten days, unless there are
new outbreaks against the forcea in
Mexico to compel immediate action.
This was made clear today when Sec
retary Uaker, dispatched Maj. Hugh
L. Scott, chief of stalf, to the border
at his personal representative to
make a complete report on the mili
tary problems confronting General
Funaton.
The adminiatration's final action on
General Carranza 'a suggestion that
the expedition be recalled probably
will be baaed largely on what is shown
in thia report. General Scott, who
left Washington tonight hardly will
be able to make the round trip and
complete his observations in less than
ten days...., . .. -
Secretary linker said General Scott'a
mission would be to assemble complete
information as to the border situation
for the uae of the department. He
also will establish a personal touch
with tha situation which Secretary
Baker has felt the need of in advising
the administration as to the military
aspects of the Mexican question.
General Scott himself explained that
he would be "the eyes of the secre
tary on the border." Accompanied by
his aide, Lieut. Col, Hubert E. L.
Michie, of the general alatT. he will
reach General Funston'a headquarters
at San Antonio next Friday evening.
Mr. Baker laid atresa in his an
nouncement on the fact that General
Funston is in supreme command of
the border situation and expeditionary
forcea at the border and will contain
ao. He said the department fully ap-
K roved every step General Funaton
ad taken, and that General Scott waa
going only because it had seemed de
sirable to get a clearer view than was
possible by means of official reports.
in tne meantime, state department
officials will take up consideration of
what reply they shall make to the
Carranza note urging the withdrawal
of the American forcea. Some ques
tions involved in that note can lie
worked out before the military situa
tion finally ia reported.
Dispatches from the border or from
Mexico today contained no word of
developments chsnging the situution.
The expedition seeking Villa is at n
standstill, apparently concent ratod al
points whore General Pershing and
General Funston believe they are best
protected against whatever mav come.
Tho only message received, the sub
itáneos of which was made public,
were of a reassuring nature, A con
sular dispatch said General Pershing's
doaire to change tha location of his
moat advanced base nvar Parral hud
met with no opposition by the Car
ranza military authorities. Gonerul
Pershing is understood to have de
sired to establish hia now base ut such
a point thut communication with the
rear would be lesa difficult.
Stale department officials poluto
out thut while the site of this new
base waa not revealed, it was "iiiil to
e nearer than the old one to I'urrul
the town where the Americuus were
fired on last week bv Carranza sol
diera and civilians.
General Gutierrez, Carranxu ennt
Plunder of the district, was r.aid to

Stnto donartment reoorts from Chi
