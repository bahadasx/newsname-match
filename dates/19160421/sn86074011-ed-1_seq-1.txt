that there are people living in
this city and county who will not
stop to view show windows.
which are an education to j our
pocketbooks. Many people do
not appreciate the money saving
oppoitunities to be found in a 10
cent store. Mr. Usrey has a Por
ter who will deliver your parcels
promptly. His is the only 5,10
and 25c store in a town of 3tCC0

Ho the Law Works.
The much' heralded law recently
passed by the Legislature placing all
county officials on a salary basis,
elminating fees and fixing salaries,
graded by counties, will increase the
incomes of the officials in some of the
counties of the State. The officials
in the larger counties, like Wash-
intcn, are the officials whose in
come will be reduced, and there is
doubt about the fairness of the law.
If tha incomes were greater in- soma
counties than others under the old
law, it is fair to assume that the
trcii and rcrcnsibility were rreater.

Anent the Bond Issue.
In my first article on bond tew I
tried to explain a few of Hn evils a
I saw them, and I have hern necun
ed by some of being opposed to good
roads on that account. This h not
the case; I would like to Fee better
roads, but not the bond isue w.n .
I have thought quite a lot over this
matter, vnd the more I think the
more I oppose it. Let us Fee uh; t
our preliminary expense would I e
before we could even ntart building
the road.
First, it would cont $000 to have
the bonds written. Second, a civil
engineer would coxt :it least $150.
Third, three road commixyiom-r
would cost $300. Fourth, in ntrninlit
cning the roads the right-of-way
would cross cultivatable lands and
woods in places, damage would
have to bo paid; tree, etc., would
have to be dug up, thi would rout
a good little sum, adding all tln'Hc
items together you could nay at leant
$5,000 of the $35,000 would be gone
and not a foot of road graded. Thin
would leave $30,000. In advertis
ing the bond you no doubt noticed
the first bonds were to mature in
ten years. If we put $500 nwny
each year as a Kinking fund, at tin
end of ten years we could pay $5,000.
If we could loan the $500 deposited
eaeh year at 5 per cent., interest, we
could pay $1,125 with the interest
at that time, making a total of
$0,125. During this time we have
paid $19,250 interest, nearly four
sevenths as much as we, borrowed.
Now take the $0,125 from $35,000,
compute the interest on the remain
der, take the difference between the
taxes collected and the interest and
maintenance each year, have your
bonds written so every dollar left over
after the above named expenses are
paid this would leave no money to
let out on interest; at the end of 25
years we would still owe around
$10,300, I do not believe we could
pay it that hist but let t!j;it r,o r
orgument ake, Dining tlm 2 yiv-
r."r.ve..jaIJ' put tin;! it 'i. i'.vj,.
numbers, t'tf.lXk). Intere;-! 'i-i.tr-'V''
more, than the loan; no riill ovm
over "$10,000. .During thi time we
have spent $70,000 in all $375 of
it each year for maintainaiice, or
$9,375, sav $10,000, take the $10,.
000 from $70,000 and we have $(;(,.
000. Now we had $30100 that ac
tually went on the roads and we still
owe over $10,000, of what you mi;lt
say we have $20,000 worth of good
roads paid for and $10,000 worth
we still owe for. You can see wr
have paid $00,000 for$20,000 worth
of roads, in other word, 1-3 of eaeh
$1.00 ppent actually reaches thr
road. Ve have given the, poor fel
low that bought the bonds $10,000.
I believe the people are willin;; to
work the road themselves, as I tirs t
suggested, but if nothing will do bu(
to raise the taxes it would be much
better to have the contractors work
their separate roads according to
specifications, let the supervisor
take the $2,800 each year, give tie
tax payers of the second district
$2.50 per day for team and driver, v
work the worst places, and at the
end of 25 years we would have $70,-
000 worth of good roads paid for
and all the money among the citi
zens. In other words, we could pay
these taxes in work. Another thing
to be considered, is a contractor gets
no less than $5 per day for each
team and did $30,000 worth of work
part paid and part unpaid, or 0,000
days work. The other way, allow
ing the same $10,000 for mainten-
ance, we woum nave .to(;,umj ai
$2.50 per day or 24,000 days work,
six times as much, the $35,000
would only be a starting point, von
cannot tell what the end would be
or who would own your lands in the
next ten years.
I say we are not able to give all
this money to some disinterested
party, and if there is no other than
the bond issue way, we had better
let good enough alone. We have
been marketing all our produce and
will continue to do so. The idea of
only 334-3 cents out of each $1.00
we pav reaching the roads is a little
too much. If you will weigh this
matter carefully, remembering it is
en easy matter to vote them, and
that it ' tabes ready money to pay
them off. I believe you will go to
tia eclben the 29th and register
yzzrxctzzt c-ainst bond issue.
"
