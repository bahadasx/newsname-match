American soldiers on whom the Mexi
cans at Parral fired erc unarmed,
according to an unconfirmed version
of the Incident current In Thlhuahua
and transmitted to Gen. Funston.
According to this story forty ot the
troopers entered Parral, presumsbly
to purchase supplies, and were fired
upon; two were killed and the
matnder retreated to the main body
of troops, encamped outside the city,
The attacking force pursued them and
were met by a fire from the Ameri
cans, who were using a machine gun,
killing forty Mexicans.
According to this story, the attack
Ins narty comprised Carranta sol
diers as well as snipers.
This version of the l'arral incident
wss sent from Chihuahua to Gen. Bell
at El Paso, who forwarded It to Gen.
Funston. Full sllowsnco was given

Washington. April 15. The United
States Is prepared to treat with Gen,
Carransn. as proposed in his note, for
the withdrawal of American troops
from Mexico. Pending the outcome
of the diplomatic negotiations, how
ever, the status of the expedition will
remsin uncbsnged snd the pursuit ot
Villa continue. This was the situ
tion.aa officially stated after' Presi
dent Wilson and his Cabinet bad con
sidered the new phases of the Mexi
can nroblem raised by Gen. Carra
fa's communication.
Secretary Lansing said ho was pre
pared to take up the matter with the
de facto government but would not
Indicate when a reply might be sent.
Secretary Baker said no orders had
been sent to Gen. Funston and that
none were under contemplation.
Secretary tanslng would not say
whether he was prepared to negotl
ate with the do facto government with
a view to the possible fixing of a
date for the withdrawal of the Amerl
can troops. He Indicated that the
time element of any agreement would
be based on what developed In the
pursuit of the bandits. As the ad
ministration's attitude Is understood
here, a satisfactory demonstration
by the Carransa military forces ot
their ability to stop, once ond for all,
the brigandage In the border states,
would see the object ot the American
expedition accomplished.

The decision to inform Germany
that recent accumulation ot evidence

There were repeated Indications
