Berlin, April 21. (By wireless to Tuckerton, N. J.,)
Germany can go no further in her submarine conces
sions to America, Admiral Von Holzendorff, chief of the
admirality staff declared today in an interview with the
United Press.
But the naval head said later in the course of the in
terview: "We have no desire for a break with the
United States. That would be insanity. We shall not
bring it about despite our desire to push vigorously our
submarine warfare.
"Many of our submarines have returned from round
ing up British vessels. They sighted scores of passenger
ships going between England and America but none was
touched although we knew everyone was carrying war
munitions for the allies.
"We have definitely agreed to warn the crews and pas
sengers of passenger liners. . We have lived up to that
promise in every way, but we cannot be asked to regard
freight ships in the same manner.
"I speak in a straight forward manner. We could
have destroyed hundreds of thousands of tons of enemy
ships since the beginning of the submarine war except
for promises .we gave the United States, but we cannot
go further.
"Five months more will see what we can do to British
shipping. The ring around the British isles will grow
tighter and tighter. Then we will see whether England
will still maintain that she cannot make peace until Ger
many is destroyed. The allies could have had peace long
ago but they still cling to the idea of starving Germany
into submission. The longer they cling to this idea the
longer they prolong the war, and the greater will be
their bill."
"What I said about freight ships ap
plies only to enemy freighters. We are
i"t going to torpedo and have not tor
pedoed without warning or without ex
amining the ship's papers of any neu
tral ship, despite reports the enemy is
bpreading. We Rre not out to torpedo
without warning neutral ships bound to
1-lnglnud. Our submarines have respect
ed every one of them so far and there
Juive been scores in the North sea, the
English channel anil the Atlantic.
"If diplomatic relations with Amer
ica are broken our submarines can at
tack any enemy ship without warning.
But remember, we have no desire for a
break with the Tinted States. That
would be insanity. We shall not bring j ly. And still we know that nil pas

her mastership of the seas, her rule of
the waves, she must accept the respon

"Germany is at war with England.

the means through our submarines to
do this and we must go ahead. England
is responsible 'for American lives on her

Insists Germany Halt Activi
ties Until Agreement Is
Reached
By Robert J. Bender
(United Press Staff Correspondent.)
Washington, April 21. America in
its note to Berlin demands an immedi
ate stop to the present submarine cam
paign against merchantmen. When this
is halted the way will be clear to set
tle the question ot how submarines may
proceed against commerce without fur
ther endingcring friendly relations be
tween the United States and Germany.
This was made clear today in point
ing out that the United States will not
be satisfied with assurauces that Ger
many will operate within the bounds
previosuly drawn namely, Adequate
warning to alt doomed ships and as
sured safety for the passengers.
Germany s present campaign must bo
liseontinned until the two governments
can decide what is practicable and le
gal in the w.y of conducting subma
rine operations against enemy com
merce. Hv the term "immediate ' in
his note, the president meant within a
time sufficient for the submarine com
manders to be notified to cense their
activities.
Grave danger hdw lies in a possible
attack upon i neutral vessel, particu
larly if there chances to be an Anieri-
an aboard. In such an event Germany
must show that the submarine com-
innder failed to receive his orders to
itiit. or a break would be prueticilly

Washington, April 21. In

connection with the Villistn raid

the return ot the American ex
pedition from Mexico, it was
learned authoritatively today.
The fact that the investiga

Ambassador Von Bernstorff
Cannot Escape From Trap
Washington, April 21. German Am-,
bassador Von Bernstorff has been
caught in u trap from which he 1-1111-1

Wolf Von Igel, former secretary to:

embassy uttnche, on bomb plot charges1

Washington has concluded that the'
German embassy faces the necessity of
admitting improper activities or hav
ing the facts proved against it. Wheth
er Von Bernstorff can show that Wash
ington is wrong remains to be seen.
Von Igel's papers form the princi
pal basis for this belief. The confes
sion of Hoist Von Der Goltz, the kais

French Claim to Have Made
Gams Following This
Fierce Fighting Today
Paris, April 21. Following a heavy
artillery bombardment, tho Germans
during the night powerfully attacked
on a trout ot more than one mile be
tween iniaumont and the lake near
Vaux, tho French official statement
I said today. South of Fort Douaumont
j the Germans entered French lines but
later were turned out by counte- at
l tacks. The French made prisoners of a
number of leutons and seized two quick
tiring guns winch had been brought
forwnrd in the advance.
Not only were tho Germans repulsed
heavily, said the war office, but in ad
dition the French advanced their lines
on both sides of the Mouse in a renewal
of fighting there.
In the region of Dead Man's hill on
the west bank French troops captured a
trench at tho edge of Caurctt wood tak
ing prisoners four officers nnd 150 men.
On the east bank the French progressed
south of Haudromont, rescuing sevornl
wounded Frenchmen who were lying on
the deadly "no man's land" between
the trenches and capturing 20 GcrmanB.
Hard Fighting Today.
Berlin, April 21. German trenches
in Caurctjo wood were penetrated by
the French in a heavy attack, it was
officially admitted today. Elsewhero
on tho Verdun front all attacks wero ro
pulsed. The Germans are hurling strong coun
ter attacks nguinst the French which
occupy the Gnurette woods, nnd tho
fighting continues with great ferocity.
In the region of Dead Man's hi"
French assaults were defeated with
slaughter.
French attacks on the northern nnd
northeastern fronts at Verdun were re
pulsed, it was officially announced to
day. .Hearing Held Today In Justice
Court In Turner Stabbing
Affair
I.ce Jeans was bound over to nivuit
tho action of the giaud jury in the
Turner justice court this morning un
der 11,(100 bonds for his part in tho re
cent fight in Turner which took place
during an entertainment, given by thu
baud. Itobert lluusaker was badly cut
with a knife during the melee when the
city council and some of the band boys
got mixed up in a free for all rough and
tumble.
The hearing was conducted before
Justce of the Peace 11. I.. Earl. Tho de
fense presented no witnesses in their
own behalf though u ,'ew of the state's
witnesses were called to the stund by
the defense to bring out some particular
points in the testimony. Justice Ee
wanted to fix Jeans' bond at $2,000
but Jeans Ihih been out under $1,1100
bonds and District Attorney Kingo was
satisfied with this amount. Justice Earl
was inclined to raise the amount, how
ever, in spite of the opinions of the
district attorney and for a few mo
ments all of the attorneys in the case
were arguing against the court.
Dr. G. II. Hobertson was the first
witness called 'for the state nnd he told
of the extent of lluusaker 'h wounds.
Tho one in the abdomen, he said, was
the only serious cut. I.. M. Webb was
the next witness called by the stale.
considering it for several days. How
seriously the German embassy viewed it
was shown when eight demands were
made for the return of Von Igle's pa
pers and 'for the photographic copies of
them taken by the United States dis
trict attorney's office.
It was freely predicted that Von
Bernstorff might be handed his pass
ports for reasons independent of the
submarine controversy.
The trap results from Von Berns
torff 's desire to reclaim the documents
as embassy papers ami yet not uduiit
officially that they ore the property of
himself or the embassy. If the embassy
refuses papers involving criminal pro
paganda, tho government is free to use
them. The documents and the evidence
of Von Der Uolte are believed to show
that Captains Von Papon and Boy cd
recalled embassy attaches,-were uot the
"highest up" men in the alleged pro
paganda plots. Von Der Goltz in his
statement said that Von Bernstorff
quashed an alleged plan to invade Canada.

Because this is tluod Friday it was

that there would be no public comment
