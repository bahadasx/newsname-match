Plan Annual Dinner
of Commerce Body
NINE NEW DIRECTORS WILL BE
ELECTED AT ANNUAL
J DIRECTION
I/'Ikhs for the annual nun-tin;? and
banquet of i!iti Fairmont Chamber of
Commerce are underway today and a j
committee to arrange the details or;
ih-. meeting will be appointed!shortly :
by President il. J. I'toss of Clie cham
ber. A few members short of a uuorum 1
were pr? sent at the meeting held yes
terday altcrnonn so no business was j
transai ten except holding of a direc
tor's meeting.
It wus suggested yesterday that ;??-'
ter the committees appointed for the;
work report on the three refureiidums j
now before the chant be:*. that the que *'?
lions \)2 submitted to the pvpli ot
the city through the newspapers aim
that a vote be taken to determine j.ab
lie sentiment. This could e.iv'lv oe i
done b/ the coupon method. Since
the three referenduma concern eyery
one and take up the questions of pre
par"d?irss. price maintenance, at.?I I
agricultural extension, it is thought1
that a popular vote recorded by the
Chambers of Commerce throughout;
the country would have mom weight
with Congress than even the vote of
the Chambers.
Nine new directors will be elected
at the annual meeting which is to be
held May 11. It is not likely that an
other of the Chuinber will be held be
fore that time unless some important
proposition should come up.

LICENSE TAXES
WILL BE REVISED
BY AFFAIRS BOARD
Many Changes Will Be Made
From Existing
Figures.
ARE AFTERJCTIEERS
Some Reductions Will Be
Necessary to Conform
r to State Change.
A license ordinance prepared bv
City Clerk Albert Kern ami to be sub
mitted to tile City Hoard of Affairs ut
Hie meeting next Monday morning by
Finance Commissioner J. Walter
Barnes is now ready ror that board.
Tbe changes in the new ordinance
affecting costs of licenses in Fairmont
arc numerous. Many have been re*
duued and an almost equal number
have been raised. The city, should tbe
ordinance be accepted and passed by
the council, will show a net gain on
its books over the old license prices.
This proposed ordinance will be put
before the board next Monday for th?j
purpose of getting It ready to submit
to tbe City Council at its monthly
mooting, the first Monday in May.
| Should this ordinance pass the board
and manage to live over the first Mon
day in May without having been ve
toed. the law will be effective July I.
1916.
Tlio old license laws of Fairmont in
many cases called for taxes higher
than that enforced by the state law.
it Is against the laws of tlie staia for
a citv to charge higher fees than the
state' does but the books of the city
of Fairmont show that the practice
of collecting higher charges has beou
going on right along. This will
terminate when the board takes action
on the proposed ordinance.
Citv Clerk Kern, who worked with
his department force ror some lime on
the ordinance, feels Hint it will har
monize with those of other cities in
the state that ate relatively as largu
as Fairmont and that there will be no
complaints rrom the business men of
the citv as they have been getting
licenses Cheaper here than in other
cities, flic license rates of Clarksburg.
Wheeling. Parltorsburg. Charleston
and Fairmont were compared. '1'he av
erage arrived at in many cases was
taken as the ground for the new
charges. In Charleston anil Wheeling,
drug stores pay $10 per year license. In
other cities the price Is ?2. The state
? tuX is S2. Thus does Fairmont charge
i $2. Other taxes were arrived at in a
' similar manner, except the tax to be
charged to untaxed merchandise which
may bo sold or at ten-Tiled to be sold
by auctioneers.
Fairmont merchants have complain
ed on several occasions to the city
that every time auctioneers come hero
to sell goods to Fairmont era, they not.
only sell the goods on hand, but pur
chase. receive and sell other goods as
long as the buying remains prolit
able. There are times whoti stores are
closed on account of failure to nice?
their liabilities that such stores nre
sold at public auction. Information lias
been furnished the Business Men's
association that as soon as the auc
tion is announced, more gondii are
bought and later sold, which goods
havo not been taxed. This procedure
does not meet tlio approval of the
buisncss men here and for that reason
Mi lire will be inserted In the new or
dinance a clause which forces all auc
tion managers to first get a permit
of the city clerlt. It is also left In tlio
power or the city clerk to question
and make to answer under oath those
who desire taking out such permits
as to whether the goods they intend
to sell are taxed or untaxed. Should
any goods bo found al any auction
which has been declared taxed and It.
Is later proved .that such goods wora
not laxeil, the obtalner of tlio perlffit
Is liable to a fine not exceeding $100
nor less than $25, and may also be
confined to jail for not moro than 30
days. The proposed rates as they will
be submitted to the board next Mon
day follow:
Auction goods per $100, $2; auc
tioneer. $20; automobiles, oaeh car,
$5: banker (private), $25: billiard
tpbie first, $50; billiard table, each
a nltional. $25: bowling alloy, first.

ren of school age listed the per cap-'
ita allotment is not expected to ho
as largo.

BIT FAILS TO
I
City Hall's Back Yard Dirt
iest Placc in Town Says
Mayor.
TOWN INGOODSKAPENOW
Mayor Has Diverting En
counter With Foreign
Woman.
"The dirtiest placc in all Fairmont
right now is directly behind the May
or's office in Cleveland avenue. Wish
the Street department i>f the city
would pet wise and act like good cit
izens of Fairmont and clean up."
Thus spoke Mayor lib wen this morn
ing in tones just a little short of an
fgcr. While he has been working dili
gently from sun up to sun (Town to
make Fairmont the state's cleanest
city, his own colahorers in the city
building have fallen down and failed
i to hold up their end of the campaign.
The plot just behind the city build
jing and facing Cleveland avenue is
|,onc of the most unsightly places in
I Fairmont. It will be necessary for
Ithe street department to get to work
! right away and clean up that lot or
the mayor and sanitary officer will
I have to take picks and shovels them
; selves.
After five days of work Fairmont
seems to have taken on ? 99 and
-44/100 per cent pure appearance, and
I outside of a few back yards which
j will bo looked after this afternoon and
I tomorrow there is no reason for com
| plaint.
j While on his trip around the-city
'yesterday the Mayor had occasion to
tell a foreign woman to clcan up.
| The Mayor doesn't understand for
eign language and it is likely a good
thing that lie doesn't for when that
Mrs. Rosa got. through her lower jaw
the neighborhood had' almost come
to the conclusion that .a . giganltc
graplioplione had been turned loose
and that it was out of the hounds of
human possibilities to turn it off".
The woman was angry for being
told lo clean up. She fumed and fum
rid uiit.il her husband, who can speak
.English rather unbroken came home
and explained the matter to her. Blush
ing profusely Rosa migrated from the
back yard fence to the room which
*he called the kitchen dining room
and bed room. The mayor with a grin
spurred his mount and was off down
the alley hunting more refuse.
