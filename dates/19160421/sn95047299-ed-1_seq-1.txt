AND AN ICE PLANT
Will be Operated in East
Palatka in Short Time.
The Browning Lumber Company
has decided to incorporate and en
large its already big business of lum
ber manufacture by the addition of
an electric light and ice manufactur
ing plant.
Mr. S. S. Browning, the head of the
company, who gave The News this in
formation, stated that the immense
amount of waste material from the
mills would be used as fuel for the
additional plants instead of being
burned needlessly as now, and adding
nothing to the cost of production.
"East Palatka," said Mr. Browning,
"is growing, and when the new brick
highways are completed as now seems
probable by fall, our main streets are
going to need this light. We will
also sell light to the people of the
town. We have not decided as yet
what capacity plant we will put in for
manufacturing ice, but it will be of
sufficient capacity to care for a grow
ing business. We shall go about
making these improvements in short
order."
The Browning Lumber ComDanv's
plant is situated on one of the most
beautiful spots that line the shores of
the St. Johns river. It is just around
the bend of the river above Palatka.
The bank is high here and there is
an extensive lawn reaching back from
the shore and facing which are the
pretty homes of Mr. Browning and
his sons. Just back of these homes'
some six hundred feet is the road
leading to San Mateo, the main thor
oughfare to the south. Here are also
several modern dwellings owned by
the Brownings, together with the
merchantile establishment preside.)

most popular young business men.

Mr. Rogero says that the East Pa-latka-San

the court house, Judge Wills having
adjourned court for the occasion.
These gentlemen occupied most of
the afternoon with their speeches, and

VETOES SALARY BILL
City Council Makes Appoint
ments for Ensuing Year.
The full complement of aldermen
were present at the meeting of the
city council on Tuesday night, togeth
er with a large crowd of citizens in
terested in the appointments to be
made for the various city offices.
This was the first business meeting
of the new council, and on the sug
gestion of Chairman Neck, that it was
up to the body either to adopt new
rules, or those already in vogue for
thi tranacting of business, on motion
of Alderman Jarrett, seconded by
Alderman McNally, the rules of the
old body were adopted unanimously.
Alderman Becks of the Ordinance
Committee reported an ordinance sep
arating the office of City Assessor
from that of City Clerk and Collector,
combining the latter two and making
a new office of City Assessor, to be
filled by a separate person, at a sal
ary of $400 per annum. An effort
was made to amend the salary fea
ture of the bill by increasing the
amount to $600 per year, but this fail
ed. The ordinance then passed its
third reading and was duly approved
by the mayor.
A resolution of some two months
ago, calling for bids from city pub
lishers for bids for printing city or
dinances was indefinitely postponed.
It was found that but one bid had
been made. The original resolution
reuqired the clerk to advertise for
bids, which was done, but the publish
ers generally appeared to take little
interest in the matter, as only one of
them made a bid.
J. V. Walton, in the absence of the
regular city attorney went into an ex
position of the difficulties incident to
the collection of delinquent city taxes
on distress warrents, and made a
most interesting talk on the subject,
which was greatly appreciated by the
members.
A veto message from Mayor Mer-
riam was received in which his honor
disapproved the ordinance recently
passed cutting the salary of the mu
nicipal judge from $50 per month to
$20. No attempt was made to pass
the ordinance over the Mayor's veto.
The council also authoried the pub
lication in pamphlet form of the an
nual report of the city auditor. Mr.
Howell A. Davis, a retiring coueilman,
perhaps more familiar with the city's
finances than any of the citizens, in
a few remarks pointed out the value
of this report.
The W. C. T. U. sent a letter to the
council suggesting an ordinance pro
hibiting the sale of cigarettes to mi
nors, or children, which was referred
to the ordinance committee. The
evils of the cigarette habit on children
were pointed out in the letter.
The council then proceeded to the
election of minor city officers and em
ployes, with the following result:
City Treasurer H. F. Leeks.
City Physician Dr. J. C. Chandler.
Municipal Judge J. C. Calhoun.
City Engineer S. C. Stallings.
City Clerk W. A. Williams, Jr., by
acclamation.
City Assesor Geo. W Lansing.
Chief of Police C. M. Livingston.
Policemen John Barber and W. M.
Cannon.
Fire Chief Albert Phillips, by ac
clamation. First Assistant Emmett D. Simm;.
Second Assistant "Bill" Pearce.
The election of a city attorney was
postponed until the next meeting.
On motion of Alderman Austin, sec
onded by Alderman Jarrett, the pay
of the city policemen was increased
from $60 to $75 per month.
Library Contest Vote.
That a deep interest is being taken
by Palatka and vicinity in the Libra
ry contest that is being conducted by
a number of progressive business
firms, is evidenced by the avalanche
of votes deposited in the ballot box.
Practically all the organizations com
peting for this coveted prize made r.
wwl shnwinrr at the ODeniner count
and it is everybody's fight up to this
point. There will be some tau nust
ling from this on as there is always a
HvpIv scramble to accumulate the
largest number of coupons.
The plan of this contest is a simple
one. A handsome library of 102 vol
umes and four sections of beautiful
cases which are being exhibited in the
show window of the Fearnside Cloth
ing Co. will be presented to the
church, lodge, school or society having
the largest number of votes at the end
of the contest.
Votes are counted by the judges
Messrs. Will N. Walton, C. H. Price
and R. M. Coleman each week and the
result printed in The Palatka News
exclusively. Be sure to insist on re
ceiving a coupon when making a pur
chase, then deposit your ballot in the
only ballot box which is at Ackerman
Stewart Drug Co.'s store.

AGAINST ERRORS
Installed in Palatka Bank
A Wonderful Machine.
The State Bank of Palatka has just
aaaeu a most ingenious machine to Us
equipment, a machine that posts ledg
ers and deDositors' Rtatemena
neatly, quickly and accurately than it
is possioie ip ao tne same work by
hand. People who are not acquainted
with the inside workings of a bank do
not realize tne great advantage of ma
chine work over hand and mind work.
The advantages are the saving in time,
ausuiiue accuracy and a great im
provement in the legibility of the
ledgers and statements.
'lhe machine is the latest model
Burrouirhs bank
the operation of it is nothing short of
marvelous. The date is placed in the
machine in the morning and prints
uuiomaucaiiy during tne entire day's
work. It adds the deposits to the
previous balances nf th
counts, subtracts the checks drawn
ana automatically computes the new
balance and should t.he total nf rhocVu
drawn on any account exceed the de
positors oaiance (which would cause
an over-draft) the machine locks and
reiuses to worK, until a special key
is depressed; it then prints the ex.
act amount of the ovpr-Hraft.
The State Bank of Palatka will now
De able to present every one of its de
positors with a neatly printed state
ment of their account promptly on the
morning of the first day of the month,
which is a great improvement over
the old time-honored system of bal
ancing pass books, and Mr. F. J.
Fearnside. nresidenh of tVio haul
states that through the adoption of
tne posting macnine the statements
will be keDt Dosted un to Hm(-. nf- nil
times with balances extended the same
as the ledger, so the bank will be in
position to furnish any depositor with
a complete statement of account at a
moments notice. This system pro
vides the most positive proof against
posting either deposits or checks to
the wrong account that has yet been
devised, the same mistake would have
to occur twice on the same account
the same day to go undetected.
Mr. Fearnside further stated that
before it was decided to adopt this
machine and system a very careful
investigation was made and they
found that the system had been in
successful operation for some time in
some of the foremost progressive
bank in Florida, such as the Volusia
County Bank of DeLand, Merchants
Bank of Daytona, First National
Bank, St Augustine, and many oth
ers, and he believes it to be only a
mipst.inn. ff a varv cVinrf fima nnfil
all banks will have adopted this
method ot accounting just as they did
the adding machine which has long
since been considered an absolute ne
cessity in a bank.
Th StntP Runt nf PnlnfVn will
doubtless be congratulated by its
many depositors and friends on the
increased facilities for r.evvuirr th-nii
ps well as knewing that they have pro-
l .i I i c . .
viueu an aaaiuonai saieguani against
eirors. The officers of thj bink ex
tend a cordhi invitation to every one
to call at the bank at any time mid
see this mechanical wizzard in oper
ation.
Canning Club Work. .
Miss Josephine Sipprell, Home
Demonstration Agent, has furnished
The News with the following report
of her activities for the week ending
April 15th, which shows that she has
been hard at work:
Monday At Florahome, making
preparations for Demonstration work.
Tuesday Held demonstration at
Florahome in canning of beets, and
preserving of Kumquats, Miss Wells
of Tallahassee supervising the work
ilone. The canning demonstration
was specially for the Canning Club
girls, while the preserving was mainly
for the house keepers. 35 persons
were present.
Wednesday Demonstration at
Bostwick, in preserving, jelly making,
and marmalade. This demonstration
was principally for the Club girls, who
are second year girls, but the parents
are always interested enough to be
present. The plants of most of the
Bostwick girls are doing fine.
Thursday The San Mateo school
still being in session, I gave a "Can
ning Club" talk before the girls in the
a. m., and visited each girls tenth
acre in the p. m. Most of the girls
have some very nice plants, although
the land is very dry.
Friday Office work in a. m. l on-
stilted County Supt. Cottingham re
garding extension work. Visited seed
tores, and attenaeu to oinciai uusi-
ness in p. m.
Saturday Visited Canning Uub
girls of Peniel, gave instructions re
garding planting of seed, care of
plants etc. Finished up weekly re
ports.
So far this year, the weather has
been very unfavorable toward this
work. But notwithstanding the
frosts and drouth, the plants in some
parts of the country are looking beau
tiful indeed. The continued dry
weather (most record books shows no
rain except a few very light showers,
since before Xmas) has discouraged
some of the Club girls. In other lo
calities plants were out in field and
had started to bloom, when the last
frost came, and killed every plant.
Yet the girls are going cheerfully to
work, putting out more plants etc.,
and by diligence and hard work, hope
to out wit the elements, in spite of
their antagonistic attitude.

Mr. Brakeman Writes of Florahome.
Editor Palatka News:
I spent a week recentlv at Flora-
home improving the look of things on
my place, in a general way. While
cutting brush, I bumped against a
nest of yellow jackets. For alertness
und being right on their job, they
come nearest to the Palatka Fire
Squad of any bunch I ever met. Then
arguments were of a concinving na
ture and right to the point. Stings
have been recommended for rheuma
tism: to any party wishing to take a
treatment I will offer to point out the
place if they will allow me to stand
behind a tree and witness the cure.
We can heartily agree with the
apostle in his assertion that "it is not
well for man to live alone." We
imagine that his wife was at the
beach or some Sufferage meeting, and
that he, while making a batch of bis
cuit, made a botch of it. And as lie
sat down and cut the burnt crust from
the bottom of one, he shook his head,
and whether he said any more or not
depends upon how much of the strain
his sweet disposition could bear, with
out getting out of balance.
With a spade on my shoulders I
spent a day prospecting on the soulh
prairie; like most prospectors I was
ooking tor gold. Well I didn t find
any already dug up, but believe me
there lies here the finest opportunity
for strong and willing hands to rear
up the golden ears of corn, that will
in turn produce the coveted dust, that
it has ever been my good fortune to
see.
It is better in two ways: First it is
sure here; second, it is easy digging,
both favorable points in any enter
prise. I located our little posses
sions; a stake at each corner is all
that designates it. from our neighbor: ,
as it all looks alike. It borders the
canal, where the water runs perhaps
a foot below the surface. A mil?
or more down stream I could see the
dredge dipping its way towards us and
I thought that had it not been for
the efforts of our officials (of which
you, Mr. Editor, was one) backed by
the influence of the Palatka board of
trade, it would not be there at the
present time.
The dredge has approximaely two
miles to reach Orange Grove " lake,
which at present rate of progress may
be reached in July. I believe that
farming can begin then with safety,
and not before. These lands shouid
produce 60 bushels of corn, or from
400 to 600 bushels of onions per acre,
and celery is right at home here.
Cattle were scattered over the prai
rie and look very well; from one point
I counted over a 100, and it looked to
us like easy money.
As I stood looking over the ex
panse, I began talking to myself (I
do that when no one else will agree
with me.) I said: "You toothless old
fossil, what do you expect to do with
that body of land in the state of na
ture, with not even a wagon road to
it? The reply was: I know how and
others have the muscle, and we will
whack up. The bulk of the business
of the United States is managed by
eyes that look through spectacles, and
the burden of the work is done by
those who do not. Am I right or
am I wrong? The proposition to es-
