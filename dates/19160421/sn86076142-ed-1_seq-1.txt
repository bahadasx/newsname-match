WO JANEIRO, Apr. 21. The American note to Germany has created a
deep Impression. The Gazeta De Notlclas says, "North America, by her
diplomatic attitude, make hereself i he leader of neutrtl nations against

the United States will rally all Sou th American countries.

PARIS, Apr. 21. The comment of the French rs on President Wil
son's address to congress, may be summed in these words, which 1 Petit
Parisien prints in large type over the text: "Never has the head of a state
pronounced such grave words against a slate with which It was not at war."
The president's address has overshadowed the Dritlsh cabinet crisis.

PARIS, Apr. 21. The offensive by
the French on both banks of the Meuse
resulted in the wresting of territory
from the Germans. Following up the
successes of yesterday, they returned
to the attack last night in the region
of Dead Man's Hill capturing addition
al trenches and 150 prisoners. In
Haudremcint woo the French also
Rained.
Paris advices state (he French have
at last taken the offensive and it is
believed they are receiving the sup
port of the Russian reinforcements
that have been steadily arriving at
Marseilles for over a week. The addi
tion of Russian veterans, seasoned by
two years warfare under the most dis
heartening conditions has given the
allies the support for which they awlt
ed so long as the Germans were ex
haunting themselves by hurling their
forces against the intrenchments at
Verdun. Gains by the French are re
ported from Vaux where the Germans
were driven from the trenches and
the Crown Prince's army suffered the
loss or many prisoners.
An infantry attack on Dead Man's
hill where the Germans were heavily
entrenched was successful to the ex
tent of carrying some of the most Im
portant outposts and several redoubts
with many cannon and a quantity of
munitions.

THEIR FIRST SHIPEMENT OF 25 FLASKS
Mina is on a boom. So Is Sodaville, i
Its close neighbor. They are turning
crowds away every night for want of
accommodation in hotels and lodgings
but steps have been taken to see that
all comers will find rooms and meals.
This is the fiirst effect of the develop
ment of the cinnabar and tungsten In
dustries which have drawn hundreds
of prospectors and investors to Min
eral county.
The first shipment of quicksilver,
consisting of 25 flasks, was sent out by
Pepper & Keough last week and an
other shipment is almost ready. Three
other companies are about ready to
blow In their retorts and, when these
begin to pour out the metal, shipments
will go out in big lots. Pepper &
Keough have one retort that is treat
ing one ton a day of cinnabar running
about two and one half per cent in
quick. Another retort has been order
ed for instant delivery and a third will
be shipped as soon as'possible. Seven
men aro employed and the reduction
requires half a cord of wood daily. The
cost of fuel is not a heavy item as it
is obtained on the ground owned by
the firm. With one retort the firm
Is making an average of 190 a day.
There hundred feet west, of this re
tort the group of the M'na Mercury
company, controlled by Tonopah capi
tal, is on the eve of starting with a
single retort. The Mina company will
nave tne advantage of the other ship
pers inasmuch as the ore is near and
does not Involve pack animals aa It
can be delivered at the mouth of the
retort with tram car covering a dis
tance of only 75 feet.

The fourteenth annual report of the
Tonopah Mining company was receiv
ed today from C. A. Higbee, secretary
in . Philadelphia. The report deals
with earnings and dividends since or
ganization of the company showing
that in the past 12 years 113,300,000
was distributed to stockholders on an
original investment of $1,000,000. In
addition to the dividends the company
paid off preferred stock amounting to
$380,657.61.
Excerpts from the report of V. H.
Blackburn, superintendent of the mine
are given as follows:
"Very little change has been made
during the past fiscal year in mining
methods, when 96,735 dry tons of
mine ore, averaging $14.41 per ton,
and 39,462 dry tons of dump ore, aver
aging $11. d!t per ton, were shipped to
the mill. The average gross value was
$13.66 per dry ton. The mining costs
are as follows: direct, $3.73; indirect,
0.58; total, $4.31.
"The estimated value of the total
ore assets on March 1st, 1916, is $798,-
89. The estimated tonnage is 53,49:1
including ore on the dumps. The esti
mated value per. ton is $14.93."
F. F. lleydenfeldt, superintendent of
mill, reports: "Few changes have been
made In the mill during this year.
Owing to the material increase in the
cost of supplies, on account of the
war, a direct comparison of costs with
lust year cannot be made. Notwith
standing the increased price of sup
plies the costs per ton of ore milled
show a decrease of $.035 on direct

WASHINGTON. Apr. 21. Vlacount
Chinda, the Japanese ambassador has
conferred with the president over the
provision of the pending immigration
bill, which proposed to enact into
law the so-called "gentlemen's agree
ment" restricting the immigration of
Japanese laborers.
The memorandum on the subject pre
sented by Secretary Lansing on the
proposed inclusion in the law of the
informal agreement is understood to
be repugnant to Japan. Other pro
posed Asiatic exclusion features in
the bill as passed by the house and
reported to the senate are understood
to be subjects of objection. For ob-.
vlous reasons the attitude of the ad
ministration is said to be one of dis
inclination to irritate the situation be
