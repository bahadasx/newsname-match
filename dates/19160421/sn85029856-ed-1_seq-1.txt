TO PITCH FOR LIBERAL
J. C. "Cub" Doze of Norwich left
Wichita this morning for Liberal,
where he will twirl for the Liberal
semi-pro ball team this summer.
Cub has played ball in the State
league, pitching for Sallna two years
ago, and should make a good man for
the Liberal aggregation. Though
Cub is yet a youngster, he has
pitched ball for the Norwich team
for so many years that a Norwich
team without him as its twirler is al
most Inconceivable. Wichita Eagle.
Judge and Mrs. W. C. Crow passed
through here Friday while returning
from Beaver where the Judge had
Just completed a session of district
court. While in town they were the
guests of Mr. and Mrs. C. W. Eldson.

Bold Robbery Committed
Tuesday night for the second time
In the past three years the home of
J. W. Baughman was entered by un
invited culprits evidently with the In
tent to violate one of the Ten Com-
manAmAtid M Ana ha In r at tiATfitt
the bandit or bandits made their way
to and fro with ease in the spacious .
home, and not caring to burden John
with additional light bill, they used
the conventional match, several ot
which were found strewn over the
floor.
Arriving home and finding some
evidence of disturbance an investiga
tion was made, disclosing that he or
they had appropriated a couple of the
homespun suits, a Colt's automatic
revolver and some small trinkets out
of his hope chest, and some small
change out ot the wall safe. It was
first thought that Mr. Baughman's
protege, Mr. Davenport, had merely
borrowed the suits with the idea of
increasing his wardrobe, preparatory
to a trip to the parson. However, .
that theory was soon dispelled, as he
would have had no use for the gun,
as yet.
Aiier cioBeiy questioning an me
servants, Mr. Baughman rushed down
town directly to headquarters, where
he solicited the assistance ot Night
Sargent Maddoz, then to the domicile
of the sheriff, where they found Mr.
Dobson Just lapsing in the first stages
ot unconsciousness, then locating
Floyd Reese the Sherlock Oust ot the
Rock Island, they sped down the '
Main Stem, thinking perchance the
bandits would attempt to escape on
No. 3, but no trace of them was
found. All other fast trains were .
watched that night with the same
result, and up to this writing not a
clue has beet obtained, and the -
chances are that John W. will wear
a winter suit during the ensuing sum
mer. Later Since receiving the particu
lars as to the burglarising above, v
later developments tend,, to disclose
It was a Joke. Evidently the mis
placed furniture and the eoat hanger
on the" kttfc&en floor arTne.esulti of
a Hurry to "obtain seats at the home
talent play. Articles of missing cloth
ing have been found here and there
and the Colts revolver had carelessly
been left at the owner's down-town
office. Apology to some unknown
tramp.
Mrs. Dollie Howard and son, Clif
ford, of Lloydminster, Canada, who
have been visiting relatives at Beav
er, arrived Tuesday from that place
to spend a few days at the ho ue of
Mrs. Howard's sister, Mrs. I. E. Hill.
