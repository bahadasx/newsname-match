Nothing Like Running Up and Down
Ladders to Keep Man In Good
Physical Condition He Can
Run Any Distance.
Laying bricks by day and setting up
new Irack records at nieht and on
holidays Is the daily occupation of
Hannes Kohlemainen, the great Fin
nish distance runner, now attached to
the Irish-American Athletic club of
New York, says a Philadelphia dis
patch to Indianapolis News.
"There is nothing like running up
ana down ladders and stairs carrytng
bricks to keep a man In good physical
condition," said Kohlemainen . when
one of his friends came across him in
New York the other day following the
trade he learned when he was a boy
in. Finland. "This outdoor work i
what I like."
Kohlemainen continues to be the
marvel of the athletic world as a dis
tance runner, and he shows not the
slightest sign of goins back now that
he has become acclimated. He can
run any distance from two miles to
the Marathon distance and a record
breaking speed. The number of rec
ords he now holds is legion, but he
intends to keep plugging away .after
new Indoor and outdoor marks. What
he would like best of all would be to
break the American record of 9:17 4-5
for the two-mile run, now held by Tell
Berna, the old Cornell distance star.
Kohlemainen and his trainer, Lawson
Robertson, think his record is at the
Finn's mercy whenever he goes af
ter It properly.
It was not until the Olympic games
of 1912 that Kohlemainen attracted.afr
tention on this side of the water. At

included heats In the 3,000 meters,
