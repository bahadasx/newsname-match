PROGRESS OF THE WAR.
From Verdun the only stories are that
infantry attacks are growing less often.
Only two or three reported this week.
As usual both sides claim successes, the
Germans that tbey have gained a few
yards and the French that all assaults
have been repulsed. To-day makes just
two months of fighting about this for-
The Russians have taken Trebizond
on the Black Sea. After the fall of
Erzerum about 200 miles away the Rus
sians started for Trebizond and after
considerable fighting have won their ob
jective with the help of Russian ships.
It is a port on the Black sea and will be
of value to the Russians.
There are rumors tbat there is likely
to be some sea fighting in the Baltic as
soon as the ice thaws put, Germans have
filled a good part of this sea with mines'
and there is quite a strong Russian navy
in this water.
Conscription is the issue on Great
Britain and there i9 considerable excite
ment there and the cabinet is divided on
the issue.
Villa has been killed again this week
and the reports are that the Mexicans
are bringing in the body. Few Ameri
cans believe it. The status of the
American troops in Mexico is anything
but satisfactory. The ignorant populace
many of them Villa sympathisers, look
upon our troops as invaders. TheCar
ranza government are trying to appear
friendly but many of the soldiers and
people bate the "Gringoes." At a town
ealled Parral, while onr troops were
marching through the people backed by
soldiers fired upon onr cavalry which
retreated some six miles.
From accounts we think that the re
treat was made purposely to avoid pos
Bible
complications, but two or three
American soldiers were hit
The long motor ropply trains have
been shot at several times and once at
tacked by quite a body.
Thus it will be seen most anything
might happen in that oountry almost
anytime. Meantime, the general public
we "watchfully waiting". To

indeed, just for the present,—if Villa
proves to be really dead.
WEATHER AND WATER
The wenther of the week has been
pleasant lor the the most part with a
littler ram. Felds are drying rapidly
but tbe holes are still too wet for culti
vation which delays seeding. With good
weather needing should be general nexe
week.
Tbe Pembina and. Tongue rivers have
been high this week and many farmers
living near have been busy moving grain
and other movables to higher places.
The water in the Pembina and Tongue
has receded but is still high enough to
be inconvenient in many places.
The Red river has been rising right
along and new covers a wide expanse.
The ball park in South Pembina is
covered with water and the street from
the bridge to Gerardin corner is under
water. The coulee bridges on the road
to Bmerson impassable.
The question of tbe hour is how high
will the water come? There is almost
nothing on which to make reliacle pre
dictions. Grand Forks has had very
high water, but not flood conditions for
almost two weeks, being about 35 to S6
feet of water but lacking about six or
seven feet of the high water of 1897.
The most hopeful sign here is that for
the last five or six days the aggregate
daily rise has been considerably less
than it was on corresponding days of
1897, which latter flood was just a week
ealier counting depth of water. Below
we give the comparative figures. The
high water mark of 1897 was 42 feet and
4 inches at the Pembina river bridge.
The bottom of the Pembina river is ap
parently one foot higher than in 1897
which makes the bridge planking 41 feet
above tbe-bottom of the river.
DAILY BISK OF RIVER
April 12th water was 16 feet deep at
bridge.

depth of the water at
the bridge was 38 feet 2 inches. From
water to bridge planks 2 feet 10 inches.
Wireless reports from Grand Forks
yesterday noon were that the river had
fallen about ten inches and that at
Drayton the water was at a standstill.
BONDED TO "KEEP PEACE."
While the German deplomatic situa
tion growing out of submarine attacks
is very precarious yet we believe that
Germany is too busy just now to break
with the United States, and will agree to
anything reasonable, though whether
she will live up to agreements is doubted
by many, in the light of resent history.
Several opposite advantages and
disadvantages would oocur it we went
so far as to declare war, though a sim
ple break in diplomatic arrangements
might or might not insure these.
Tbe first is, tbat with any direct pros
pect of war with Germany the United
States would probably "commandeer"
all war material now manufactured or in
process of being manufactured in this
country, it would at once stop the ex
portation of al| war material to the allies.
This because we would need all such
material available ourselves. A war
status would also give the submarines
free rein without hindrance from neutral
nations.
On the other hand there are about
fifty odd German (ships interned in
Amenoan ports, and fifteen or twenty
Austrian -vessels. Theee are mo«t!y
it'Atlantic liners of tbe larger class and
possible tbat we era avoid said to be|worth over a hundred million
military occupation of Mefioo, unlsasj
dollars. War would make thw priip
