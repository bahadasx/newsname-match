Movement; Shows Planned at
Coming Fall Fairs
Immediately following the clone of
the tshort horn Bale in Chickasha yes
terday afternoon, tho "Grady County
Shorthorn Breeders' Association" wus
organized with twenty-lour signing the
lists as original members.
The following officers were elect
ed: J. II. Johnston, president; V. H.

trre, secretary ; IS. 10. Ileeder, treas
urer. Tim directors chosen are Thomas

asha. As explained by the founders, the
object of the Grady County Shorthorn
Breeders' association Is to encourage
the breeding of registered shorthorn
cuttle in Grady county. It is expected
by those who were Instrumental In ef
fecting the organization, that within
the year the association will count not
less than .',On enterprising Grady comi
ty farmers' names upon its roster.
By scattering the membership of the
board of directors throughout the sev
eral townships of the county It is
thought that an interest will be awak
ened and kept alive In every section
of Grady county, the people of each
township having an active board mem
ber who will necessarily be posted up
on all matters of vital importance to
the breeders.
The idea in scattering the directo
rate about in this manner is also to
encourage and initiate a movement
lending to a "shorthorn show" each
season at the several township fairs,
the prize winners at these fairs to be
entered at the county fair each fall,
the prize winners at which will in
turn be entered at the sttae fair at
Oklahoma City.
In the election of officers it was so
arranged that each one elected should
be the owner of two or more regis
tered shorthorn cattle, thereby being
a man who would take the greatest
possible interest In bringing the elfi
t-iuiior of the association up to the
highest possible standard.
In speaking of the future, and of the
aim of the association, President
Johnston stated yesterday evening
that hi9 object was to pattern this
organization after the Blaine County
Breeders' association, one of the most
successful of Its kind in Oklahoma and
in the entire southwest. The Blaine
county organization was primarily
made up of a number of small breed
ers, and as the organization has
grown and the original members have
grown into "big" breeders, the "little
fellow" is still welcomed into the
body and afforded through the asso
ciation a means of finding the best
possible market for the registered out
put of his breeding farm. The idea,
as formulated and carried out in
Blaine county, and as It Is expected
to be tailed out in Grady county, is
to afford for the small breeder the
means of joining in with other small
members, as above stated, until a suf
ficient number of them shsll be gath
ered together to assure the success of
Jbe association as a body and of each
individual member. In Blaine county,
Mr. Johnston said, there are now sev
eral large breeders of shorthorn cat
tle, but the "little fellows" still have
their organization and are still work
ing harmoniously and are each year
putting on sales at their headquarters
city, Watonga, which brings pleasure
to them as lovers of fine cattle and
profit to them as breeders of such
cattle in the same proportion as may
be enjoyed by the "big brother" with
the advantages of an unlimited indi
vidual pocket book.
In referring to the sale of yester
day Secretary Goosetree said: "To
day's sale of registered shorthorns,
the first, w ill prove within the course
of a very short time to have been
worth thousands of dollars to the peo
ple of Grady county. It has ufforded
the small' breeder and the small far
mer the chance to note that register
ed cattle are a means of establishing
and maintaining a fat bank account
and it will show the value of silage
as feed. It has shown that the breed
ers ofGrady county may make money
by getting together and putting legs
on their ensilage and cotton seed meal.
It has shown that the landless farmer
who a few years ago came to the
farmerless land of Oklahoma, may
now herd the products of his fields
together and drive to market the fin
ished and not the raw and unmanufac
tured material."
The Grady County Breeders' asso
ciation will hold a regular business
meeting during the month immediate
ly preceding the holding of the Grady
county township fairs. The place and
date of holding this meeting will be
announced in due time.

Eighth Demand Made for Return of Papers
Seized in New York; Columbus
Raid Connected With Teutonic
Activities
Ry Uriled Press.
Washington, April 21. "Hcrnstorff
trapped." This is the way Washing
ton interprets the confessions of Von
dergoltz regarding his bomb activi
ties and the revelations of the papers
found in the office of Wolf von Igle,
former secretary of the recalled Ger
man military attache, who was arrest
ed in New York.
Tho cabinet considered develop
ments in tho situation today. It is
predicted that Ambassador Bernstorff
may be given his passports as a result
of the developments hi the investiga
tion of bomb plots.
The extreme seriousness with which
Germany regards the seizure of the
papers of von Igle was revealed when
the eighth demand was made that
they be returned. The embassy has
advised Berlin officials regarding the
seizure of these documents.
Regarding the Columbus Investiga
tion, it is learned that an inquiry will
probably be made, based upon revela
tions expected to be obtained when
the bandits aro captured and Induced
to confess.
The revelations of Vondergoltz are
believed to be responsible for the state
department's attitude toward the Ger
man diplomatic representatives. This
confession may result In nationwide
grand jury investigations. Though
tho confession was published in Lon
don, Vondergoltz was held at Ellis
Island for the federal authorities.
It is learned from high authority
that when tho expedition returns from
Mexico an investigation of alleged
German activity in connection with
Hie Villa raid at Columbus will be
made.
It was made clear today that the
United States government demands
that Germany stop her present subma
rine methods against merchantmen
immediately aad then open the way
whereby it may be decided how she
may attack commerce without further
endangering relations with America.
It was pointed out ihat the United
States will not be satisfied without
assurances that Germany will giva
such warning as will insure the safety
of passengers when ships are attacked.
