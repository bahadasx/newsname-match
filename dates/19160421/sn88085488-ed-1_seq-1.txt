iii.M ttKKK IX MAY
FOR CLEAN-UP week
The first week in .May has l.ecu
officially designated as "clean-up
week and all the citizens are urged
to get busy with the rake and wheel
barrow during that week, in former
years the city has provided wagons
and men free of charge to haul all
the rubbish to the dumping grounds,
and in all probability this plan will
be followed this year. Every citizen
should enter heartily into the spirit
of the occasion and lend his mite to
ward making Pullman a cleaner,
more healthful and more beautiful
town*.
OBJECT TO DUMPING
——_
A vigorous protest was registered
with the city council Tuesday even
ing against the practice of using the
extension of Kamiaken street as a
dumping ground. Eight property
owners joined in the protest, which
was referred to the streets and high
ways committee with power to act.
CITY WILL PAVE
SOUTH GRAND STREET
Preliminary Resolution Declaring for
Needed Improvement Passed by
Council — Havana Street Own*
era Ask Paving
Pullman's extensive paving pro
gram was considerably strengthened
Tuesday evening when the city fath
ers passed a preliminary resolution
declaring their intention to improve
by paving South Grand street, begin
ning at the south line of McKenzie
street, thence southwesterly along
Grand street to a point on the exten
sion of the property line between
lots 3 and i, of block 11, Garden
City addition.
This piece of road for a number
of years has been as bad as any in
the vicinity of Pullman, and in much
worse condition than the majority of
the country roads, and the action of
the' council will be hailed with de
light. The agitation for paving
South Grand was Instituted by F. O.
Brownson and other property own
ers.
Another healthy impetus was
given the paving program when
eight property owners on Havana
sireet petitioned the' council to pave
that part of their street west of the
intersection of Hr.vana and Opal
streets. The petition was signed by
Harriet Haynes, J. C. Ruth, Sina
Sain. .1. P. Duthie, the Trustee Co.,
R. .1. Barnett, Dan Mcßae and John
Melvin, the three latter signatures,
however, being contingent upon the
extension of Havana street to con
nect with Colorado street.
The petition was referred to the
streets and highways committee and
the city engineer, who will report at
the next meeting.
WHEAT SELLING SLOW
The inactivity of the local grain
markets continued during the past
week, the (tanners refusing to sell at
quoted prices. Yesterday's quota
tions were as follows:
Red Russian wheat 7No
Club wheat 80c

meet will start at 2:00 o'clock.
SQUIRES (JETS PERMIT
John Squires was granted a build
ing permit by the council Tuesday
evening for the construction of his
one-story brick building south of the
William Chambers building on Grand
street. The building will have a
frontage of approximately 52 feet on

age.

Whitman liiiuniy Sclionl Statistics
t
I.vi One of lis. Graduate* Prom the
Rural and Grammar Schools in
the Past Three Venire |«
Loafing
Of 1187 graduates of the rural
and small city grammar school in
Whitman count) during the last
three years, but one is "loafing,"
according to the educational and vo
cational survey of eighth grade
graduates now being completed by
state' Superintendent of Public In
struction Josephine Corliss Preston,
All others are reported to be en
gaged In some trade, attending
school or helping with house or farm
work at home.
Sixty-seven per cent of the rural
grammar school graduates have con
tinued their educations in high
school, this proportion being three
per cent higher than the average for
the 117 counties in which the sur
vey is now complete.
"I am very much interested in
helping the 68 boys and 85 girls of
Whitman county who are at home
assisting their parents," says Super
intendent Preston, in commenting
on the survey. "I have received let
ters from girls in Whitman and
other counties saying their mothers
are ill, in some cases dead, and that
they are keeping house and caring
for their families. Often the boys
write that they are helping their
fathers so the younger children may
attend school.
"Our state educational system
should take care of these boys and
girls whoso duty compels them to
remain at home' rather than con
tinue in school. 1 am writing a per
sonal letter to each of them in an
effort to interest them in further
study, and within a lew weeks, 1
shall publish a bulletin, giving a list
of the means by which they may ob
tain more advanced education, even
Easter Services at the Churches
i —
Fine Musical Programs Will Be Feat
ures at Nearly All the Houses
of Worship Next Sunday
l'nited Presbyterian Church
The Caster service at the Presby
terian church will be a veritable
feast of song. Two beautiful con
tatas have been prepared and in addi
tion to this, solos will be rendered
by members of the choir and the
Presbyterian male quartet will sing,
ln the morning the Easter cantata,
"Death and Life,'' by Shelley, will be
given. Probably no more beautiful
cantata for Easter has been written
and the splendid choruses, solos and
duets commencing with the mockery
of Christ, portraying the grief of the'
rejection by His chosen people, the
pain and sorrow of death, and finally
the joy of resurrection and triumphal
glory, present a song picture of re
markable beauty and power.
The entire evening service will be
devoted to the rendition of A. Gaul's
"Holy City," and this splendid mas
terpiece of the famous composer
needs no description. There is no
sacred cantata that has been so often
sung by first class choirs as "The
Holy City." There is not a solo,
duet, quartet, quintet or chorus In
the entire work that is not a gem of
sacred song and that does not appeal
to all classes through the beauty of
its sentiment and its melody. The
giving of this work marks an epoch
in the history of church music in
Pullman and great credit is due the
Presbyterian choir for its selection
and preparation of such beautiful
music. Both morning and evening
services are under the direction of
Prof. Frank C. ('halfant of the Col-
I lege. Mrs. .1. R. Stephenson will
play the accompaniments for both
cantatas.
The soloists for the morning serv
ice are Mrs F. C. ('halfant. Miss Iva
Davidson, and Miss Zella Melcher, so
pranos; Miss Malda Witt, alto; Mr.
Geo. Spinning and Mr. Foote, tenors,
j and Mr. Harry Lynde, bass.
In the evening the solos, duets,
and quartets will be given by Mrs.
Chalfaut, Miss Davidson and Miss
though it is impossible for them to
attend high school or college.
"This survey will not only enable
the' department of education to reach
the boys and girls who drop out of
school after completing the eight
grade, hut the statistics as to the
occupations entered will make pos
sible organization of vocations
training along lines of most benefit
to the largest number of pupils."
Forty-two of the graduates arc
employed as farm hands; 10 as la
borers; 10 as domestic servants; six
in stores; four as telephone operat
ors; two as garage employes; one' in
a butcher shop, and one in a bak
er's.; One graduate is reported tc
have entered the- ministry, the only
one in the state. Two are barbers
and one a paper boy. Three are in
state normal schools; two taking spe
cial professional training and five
are' in business colleges.
The healthful environments in
Whitman county are attested by the
fact that but one of the graduates It
reported to have died. Twenty-six
have moved from the state, and 51
from the district in which they at
tended school. No reports have
been received from is. and the
whereabouts of 26 are unknown, In
order thai the records may be com

NEW CITY QUARTERS
ARE WELL APPOINTED
Commodious Assembly doom, Dining
Doom ami Kite lion Available for
Municipal Oathei ings—City
Oliees on Cower door
The completion this week of the
remodeling of the city hall provides
a commodious assembly room, dining
room and kitchen for municipal gath
erings and for meetings and banquets
of the chamber of commerce, as well
as an elegant home for the city lath
ers during their fortnightly delibera
tions. The entire second story of tlie
city hall has been remodeled. All
the partitions were removed and the
entire floor space, with ihe- exception
of a small but well appointed kitchen
in the northeast corner, is available
lor public gatherings. The new
quarters will provide ample' room for
all public assemblies and when used
las a dining room will easily seat 200
persons. The' entrance to the hall
has been changed to the Kamiaken
street side.
The lower floor has been fitted up
for office rooms for the various city
officials, doing away with the flight,
of stairs which it was formerly neces
sary to climb to gain access to the
official sanctums. The southeast
corner of the lower floor will be fit
ted up as a municipal rest room, the
other rooms on the south side to be
fitted up for the city treasurer and
city clerk, the clerk's office to abut
the city bastile, with the' vault to the
north. An office has also boon pro
vided for Water Commissioner C. M.

trance of the building is completed,
probably some time next week.

Indians After Ten Innings of
I lose Play—Visitors
Look Weak
Manager Nick Williams or the
Spokane league baseball team must
bolster Up his team considerably to
prove a pennant contender in tile'
Northwest league race, is the opinion
of Pullman fans who braved the cold
weather to watch the first three ball
games of the Spokane S. C. ser
ies, played on Rogers field Monday,
Wednesday ami Thursday. In the
first contests W. S. C, showed great
er batting strength than the visitors,
while Pitcher Moss proved just as
good as Salveson, and Hartman had
a considerable edge over Leonard In
the same- capacity. Spokane has an
excellent fielding team, but was out
fielded in the first game, having an
edge in this department In the mi
ond ami third.
The gtrst game was won by the
visitors in the tenth inning when a
---' tie was broken, Spokane annex
ing a third run and holding VV. S.
('. scoreless in the extra frame.
The second game' ended .. to 2.
Spokane In this case annexing three
runs In the extra Inning when the
locals blew up and let three griev
ous errors mil of their systems.
Pitch or Hartman was the worst of
fender in this inning and has nobody
to blame for his defeat but himself,
although in' pitched big league ball
throughout.
The work of Pitcher Mickey Sha
de r was tin' feature of ihe first two
game's, the spit ball artist acting as a
relief pitcher. in the first game
lie whiffed Pitcher Moss with
the base's full and two down in the
extra inning, and repeated Wednes
day with three straight strikeouts in
tin' tenth after W. S. ('. had started
a batting rally.
