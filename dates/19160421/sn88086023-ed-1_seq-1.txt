Chief of German Admiralty Staff in
Interview Declares That Such a
Course Would be Insane.
SUBMARINES KEEP PROMISES
Xo Passenger V easel Torpedoed With
out Warning, Declares Official ;
Envy Concession Possible to Make
Has Ileen Made; England Must be
Held to Answer.
(BY CARL ACKERMAN.)
BERLIN, April 11. ( Wireless to
Tuekerton, copyrighted) Germany
can go no further In Its submarine
concessions to America, Admiral von
Holtxendorff, chief of the admiralty
staff, declared in an Interview with
the United Press today.
"We have no desire to break with
the United States," he said. "That
would be Insanity. We shall not bring
It about despite our desire to push
vigorously our submarine warfare.
Many submarines have sighted scores
of passenger ships between England
and America. None has been touch
ed, although we knew that every one
carried munitions for the allies. We
have definitely agreed to warn the
crews and passengers on liners and
we have lived up to our promise in
every way. We cannot be asked to
regard freighters In the same man
ner. We could have destroyed hun
dred of thousands of tons of enemy
ship except for the promises we
gave America."
He admitted that Borne submarines
had Iwen lost since March 1st.
"Five months more will see what
we can do with the British shipping.
The ring around England -will grow
tighter. Then we will see whether
Kngland will still maintain that It
cannot make peace until Germany
has been destroyed. We are not go
ing to torpedo and we have not tor
pedoed without warning any neutral
ship, despite reports that the enemy
is spreading. our submarines have
respected them all. We have sighted
scores In the North sea, the English
chant.tl mid the Atlantic. If diplo
matic relations with America are bro
ken our submarines can attack any
enemy ship without warning. If Eng
land boasts mastership of the sea
and rule of the waves, she must ac.
cept the responsibility, not flermany.
"During March more than 200,000
ton? of shipping were destroyed."
During the entire Interview, he sat
erect In a leather chair, his eyes di
rectly on the Interviewer and his re
marks coming suddenly with n punch
like shots from a cannon.

BERLIN, April 21. Wilson's note,
demanding a cessation of Germany'!
submarine campaign was printed to
day. The day being Good Friday
made It impossible to obtain an ex

Newspapers almost unanimously
declared that Germany will not yield,

opinion that a diplomatic break will
not result. The Vossische Zeitung
predicted that congress will prevent
a breach.

PERSHING WITHDRAWS TO

Pershing withdrew his adranc-

The expedition is stalled Fa-
4 ture activities will depend upon 4

attitude. Its contents were not
revealed.
CHIHUAHUA. April 21 The ex
humed body proved not to be Villas,
advices today stated. Consul Letch
er's reports asserted that Villa, un
wounded, is in Durango. The gener
al here announced that he had re
ceived an order prohibiting Ameri
can aviators from flying over cities
and barring the American expedition
from using the telegraphs and tele
taeaes csarraaxistas and cttlsene
fired a volley at an aviator Wednes
day while apparently attempting to
land here. He later flew toward San
Antonio. The resentment of the sol
diers and the populace against the
continued presence of the expedition
has become so general that Carran
xistas declare they will be unable to
control the people unless the troops
are withdrawn. Letcher reported that
the fight at Parral was not an Iso
lated case. Other attacks are believed
to have occurred. Gutierrez said that
he always considered the report of
Villa's death as unfounded. Letcher's
reports said that Villa probably was
not in the Guerrero battle.
Newspapers here already have .an
nounced the early retirement of the
American expedition. One printed a
Washington dispatch saying that the
United States had declared war on
Germany and needed the forces to
fight the Germans. Another article
stated that Lansing was studying plans
for an early withdrawal and gave
Carranza the credit ror halting the
Americans.
The concentration of Carranxistas
south of Parral apparently was for
the purpose of opposing Americans In
an attempt to march southward. Her
rera was instructed to inform the
Americans that they must not ad
vance beyond Parral. The garrison
there has been reinforced. Thousands
of American cavalrymen have con
centrated 10 miles north. When news
paper correspondents arrived from
Juarez a mob of Mexican boys pelted
them with stones. Gutierrez arrested
the ringleaders. Lieutenant Castro
said that the Mexican soldiers already
were murmuring against the expedi
tion. When the feeling spreads to the
officers It is likely to result In open
hostility.
