The Van Nassau sailed from Chile

message of April 9 said she had been
hem-up In The Downs by the British

offer no explanation. It was said at
the embassy that tho suspension of
traffic will be complete except in the
caso of vessels carrying government
cargoes and even in that case they
can secure admission to the ports only
by special permit from Petrograd.
It is assumed by the officials here
that the closure is a purely military
measure Incident to the use of the
ports for embarkation for the heavy
Russian reinforcements going forward
to France.
The necessity of guarding the troop
transports has obliged the Russian
government to regard as enemy ves
sels all but governmentrowned or

minimum the danger of destroying
neutral vessels, tho ports have been
closed.

AMERICAN NOTE
A GOOD MOVE
South American Countries
Will Rally to Side of United
States in Case of War.
- " '-
Rio Janeiro April 21. Tho publica
tion of tho American note to Germany
created a deep, Impression on publLo
opinion and the press. The Journal
De Commerclo says:
"The United States profoundly im
pressed by tho responsibility assum
ed in the American continent by the
proclamation, adoption and preserva
tion of tho Monroe doctrine, feels
clearly that if Germany is victorious,
sooner or later, she will turn against
the United States tho powerful weap
ons which will have conquered
tho great strength of the allies.
The expected action of President
Wilson yesterday will be a forward
march signal to the mighty American
nation."
The Gazette Do Noticlts says:
"North America, by her diplomatic
attitude makes horself tho leader of
the neutral nations against piracy."
Tho Epoca holds that Germany's
war methods placed hor in political
circles outside the human pale and
expresses no doubt that in caso of war
tho United States will rally all the
south American countries.
Champion of Neutrals.
Buenos Aires, April 21. In com
menting on the Amorican noto to Ger
many, La Naclon says that tho Unit
ed States In taking up the defense
of all neutrals places itself in a po
sition with which neutrals are In ex
treme sympathy. "Tho United States
Is tho ono great neutral power," says
the iapor. "Consequently Its voice
must carry the greatest weight, not
because of the nation's army ano
navy, but because of Its civilization,
its democracy and Its economic capac
ity. All American republics partici
pate in tho same sentiments and greet
with profound political sympathy the
constant deBlre of President Wilson
to render Icsb grievous the effects of
the war and enforco respect for neu

RUSSIAN COMING
LONG EXPECTED
Plan to Bring Quarter Million
Soldiers to Western Front
Allies to Equip Them.
PLENTY LEFT BEHIND
Russian Problem Not Men,
But Munitions Hundreds
of Thousands in
Training.
Marseilles, April 20. The coming of
Russian troops to tho western front
has been talked of by military people
for two or three months. The reason,
as now explained, Is that It is easier
for Russia to arm and supply fighting
material to Russian troops on the
western front than on the eastern.
Russia still has many hundred
thousand more men under training
than she can use on her fighting
lines, becauso the Russian problem
continues to bo not how to get the
men, but munitions. The allies can
obviously provide complete equipment
for Russians more easily In France
than by shipping to Russia. Possibly
a quarter of a million men will be
sent Into France this spring.
Delayed By Storm.
Marseilles, April 20, 4 30 p. m. The
arrivals of the transports which
brought the Russian troops sent to
join the entente forces on tho western
front had been expected since Tues
day, but a heavy storm In the Medi
terranean delayed their reaching here
until today.
Every precaution for their protec
tion had been taken owing to reports
that hostile submarines were operat
ing in the Mediterranean, but the voy
age was concluded without untoward
Incident.
Crowds Cheer Russians, y
Marseilles, April 21, 1:05 p. m. The
Russian troops which' reached Mar
seilles yesterday contlnuo to be the
center of enthusiastic demonstrations
from crowds In the approaches to

rived -force Is quartered. The Rus
sians show no ill effects of their long

all tho ovldence In regard to Ger
man activities that is now In the

is understood to show that the lease
was taken In von Igel's name. This
evidence was desired In connection
with the settlement of the question
as to whether tho offices wero rented
by the Gorman embassy and thore
fora wero to bo considered German
territory.

Chemist Denies Conspiracy Charge.
Roseburg, Ore., April 21. George
Schudmacher, a German chemist, liv
ing at Edlnbower River farm, near
here, named In a sworn statement by
Hurst von dor Goltz, German soldier
of fortune and secret agent now held
at tho Ellis Island immigration sta
tion, as being one of several alleged
to be implicated In bomb plots In this
country, made light today of the idea
of his having any connection with a
conspiracy. The von der Goltz state
ment was made public last night by
the British government In London.
Schudmacher said Jils name prob
ably Is on tho list "of Germans in
America who are subject to military
duty.
This and the fact that he Is an ex
pert chemist, he asserted, may have
resulted In attempts to implicate him.
During the last threo years, "Schud
macher has been in the poultry busi
ness and much of his lime, he said,
had been devoted to chemical experi

LOSES MM MEN
Attack Against British in
Mesopotamia Proves a Cost
ly Move for Moham
medans. London, April 21, 5:02 p. m. Tho
recent nttack of tho Turks on the
British forces along the Tigris In
Mesopotamia was made by about 10,-
000 mon and cost them heavy losses.
An official account of the battlo, sup
plementing earlier reports from the
British commander, was given out to
day as follows:
"The enemy made his attack on the
17th and 18th with some 10,000 men,
comprising ono whole division and
portions of two others. They came
on In dense formation and penetrated
part of our front. Within 500 yards of
tho front of one of our brigades alone,
1,200 to 1,500 dead Turks were count
ed. "It is reported they are lying thick
farther out before the front on other
portions of our line. Their killed,
alone, on the night of April 17-18 are
estimated at more than 3,000. In sev
eral instances attacks wore led by
Germans, some of whom were killed.
"Apparently the enemy supposed
that part of our troops wore Isolated
by floods and that they had a chance
of overwhelming It. As a matter of
fact, supports were moving up at the
time.
"Our total casualties, killed, wound
ed and missing wero very considerab
ly less than the Turkish killed.
"On the 18th, stormy weather mado
aircraft reconnaissance very difficult.
The floods are spreading and the riv
er Is still very high."

ities detailed to investigate the report that the body recently

reported today they were unable to obtain confirmation. No ' j
details were given which would tend to throw light on the situation.
Washington, April 21. All data at
hand bearing on the Mexican situa
tion was assembled at the state and
war departments ready for submission
to the cabinet today. President Wil
son and his official advisers were ex
pected to review the Mexican prob
lem fully for the first time Bince Gen
eral Carranza urged that the Ameri
can expeditionary forces bo with
drawn. A border report that Gen. Herrora
had granted use of the Mexican rail
ways to Col. Brown and the Tenth cav
alry to "withdraw from Parral" was
explained today by army officials as
merely a movement of the American
field bnso near Parral. Secretary Bak
er Insisted there wero no orders or
information upon which to base a
withdrawal rumor. The department
had been previously officially advised
that Mexican authorities would not
object to a base somewhat nearer
Parral. j
No dispatches came to the war de
partment overnight from Gen. Funston
and all information indicated the Vil
la hunt was practically at a stand
still. Secretary Baker said there
were no now orders.
Moving American Troops.
Ei Paso, April 21. Movements of
American troops from points along
the border to the army base at Co
lumbus where they will be held In
raadiness to reinforce General Persh
ing's army in case of necessity, still
continued today. Dispatches from the
front Indicated that everything was
quiet and that American troops In
Mexico wero awaiting developments
at Washington before making any fur
ther effort to capture Francisco Villa.
Officials of the do facto govern-
ment said there was no basis for the
rcrorta that uprisings were imminent
in northern Durango and lower Chi
huahua. It was explained at Juarez
that ihe movement of Carranza troops
Into the Parral district was not In
tended as a threat to bar the further
advance of the American forces but
that the de facto soldiers had been
sent there to preserve order and pre
vent destruction of private property.
Work of Expedition Concluded.
Andreas Garcia, Mexican consul,
said today that the work of the Amer
ican expedition was concluded, and
that ho hoped that in a few days the
order would come from Washington
for the troops to be withdrawn.
"We have the situation In hand."
said Mr. Garcia, "and the few remain
ing bands of Villistas are no more
than stragglers. The Villlsta cause
Is broken and if Villa still lives his
prestige is destrojed."
Mr. Garcia said he expected that
the economic situation would soon
improve In Mexico, the government
on the first of next month will de
mand that all Import and export du
tlos be paid In gold. The Mexican
consul did not credit the reports that
the law demanding gold for such du
ties would create trouble.
San Antonio, April 21. Public in

NEW CROP OF
BANDIT RUMORS
Little Credence Placed in
Stories Locating Francisco
, Villa Believe Bandit
Is North of Parral.
El Paso, Texas, April 21. The con
tinued absence of any confirmation of
the report of tho death of Francisco
Villa has revived again the popular In
dustry In El Paso of locating the
bandit. During tho last two days he
has been successively reported from
"roliablo Mexican sources" as in Du
rango, Zacatecas and Coahuila. His
last location to date was given by a
Mexican railroad as at San Isldro, a
little town abut thirty miles south of
Parral in Durango.
Little credenco Is placed in these
stories hero by Americans and Mexi
cans who are in tho best position to
secure reliable news from the Interior.
There Is a very strong belief hero
that Villa has nover been as far south
as Parral and that the real reason for
tho outbreak agalnBt the Amorican
troops at that town was that the
Mexicans knew Villa was In the north
and concluded that the American aol-
dlers wero not pursuing the bandit but
were engaged in a5 veritable Invasion , ,
of Mexico.
Border Nervousness Increases.
With the troops making time await- j
Ing the decision from Washington J
which will either withdraw them from jk
Mexico or send them forward rein- ll
forced on their quest, there has been 1)
a decided increase in the nervousness
which has existed on tho border since I
the expedition crossed the interna-
tlonal line. 1
Both Mexican army officers and of- I
ficlals admit the uncertainty has I
caused a delicate situation, but there I
has not been the slightest indication -
In Juarez that the Mexicans ia that j
town have changed their attitude o 'A
restraint. General Gavlra renewed to- ,
day his ropeated statements that the J '
Carranza leaders had no hostile Inten-
tion toward the American columns, t
while they felt the time had come for
the recall of the expedition.
No news has been received in
Juarez regarding the party headed by'
General Cavazez and Colonel Carlo
Carranza which set out last Sunday
to search for the supposed grave ot
Villa. In reply to a query sent by
General Gavlra, General Gutierrez, 'S
military commander in Chihuahua, re- I
plied today that he had hear nothing J
of the party since It left. J
