LONG-LOOKED-FOR AUDIT
OF COUNTY AT LAST
COMPLETED

wait in vain un
til thursday
morning
Former Officials Moore and Badley
as Well as A. O. Christopher Are
Declared to be Short in Accounts—
Report Received by Papers too Late
to Allow Accused Men to Make Any
Statements—Harger Has Fifteen
Cents Coming to Him—Report is
Published in Full Including Various
Tables of Interest.
The much -heralded report of the
audit of the Canyon County books is
at last complete. True to form, those
in charge of the report were careful
that a copy did not reach the hands
of any Republican paper until Thurs
day—when it was thought too late for
publication.
By courtesy of The News, which
received the report Tuesday, The
Tribune is able to present the same in
full to its readers. No comment is
possible on account of the late hour
of receipt.
The report follows:
We beg to submit our report
showing the result of our audit of
the Canyon County books covering
a period from the second Monday in
January, 1907, to the second Monday
in January, 1915.
This report is based upon the
books and records of Canyon coun
ty as we have found them. We wish
to state that a great deal of care
lias been used in checking these ac
counts, and whenever possible, the
officials concerned have been con
sulted in regard to the balances due
the County, this latter action being
taken with a view of doing no man
an injustice and to eliminate, if pos
sible, all technical errors made by
them during the past eight years.
The first office we desire to près
ent is that of Probate Judge.
Probate Judge
Covering a period from the second
Monday in January, 1907, to January
21st, 1910 inclusive, Probate Judge
being Mr. Hagelin.
We find by the books that there
is a balance due the county of $81.95,
of which $6.95 is for four fees, and
$75 is for fifteen marriage fees at
$5 each. Judge Hagelin believes
that lie was within the law when he
retained these marriage fees owing
to a decision of the Supreme Court,
and to an understanding with the
county commissioners relative to
the same. We present the matter,
however, to you for consideration.
During his term of office there
were thirty-seven cases relating to
the probate of certain estates, which
cases have not been properly closed
up in our opinion. This could be
ascertained by getting in touch with
the attorneys who represented the
different cases.
PROBATE JUDGE—Covering
period from January 22d, 1910, to
July 21st, 1910, the Probate Judge
being C. J. Sebring.
We find that there is a balance
due the county of $39.60, and that
there are eleven cases in tho Estate
Books which have not been properly
closed up.
PROBATE JUDGE—Covering
period from July Jilst, 1910 to Jan
uary 11th, 1913 the Probate Jndgi
being B. W. Henry.
We find that there is a balance
due tho county of $169.90, and that
there are thirty-sevon cases in the
Estate book which have not been
properly closed.
PROBATE JUDGE—Covering
period from January Uth, 1913, to
January 9th, 1915 D. D. Harger, Pro
hate Judge.
We find that there is a balance
due Judge Harger of $0.15, and that
there are thirty-eight cases which
have not been closed up.
Concerning those eases mentioned
which have not been closed up, will
«litte I hat in the natural course ot
events these cases many times run
for several years before they are
dually closed, and it does not nec
Probate
essarily mean that the Probate
Judge is short in his accounts.
We believe, however, that the
matter could be checked up with
Hie individuals who have entered
these cases in court, by some com
petent person, in order to ascertain
• lie real standing of the cases, and
• lie same reported to the commis
sioners.
SHERIFF—Covering a period
fioni the secom^Monday in January,
•911, to tho second in January, 1909,
Sheriff, W. H. Thorp.
We find that there is a balance
due the county of $12 for four Sher
iff's deeds, and- the records show
that there were fees earned in twen
•y-one cases which we aro unable to
And in the fee book, as per chart
submited herewith.
SHERIFF— Covering a period
from the second Monday in January,
1911, to the second Monday in Janu
ary, 1913, J. W. Watkins, sheriff.
We find that there is $15 due the
county from five Sheriff's deeds, and
that the books show that there are
fees earned in thirty-four cases
which we are unable to find in the
fee books.
We desire to call your attention tn
the receipts which Mr. Watkins
presented, representing money paid
out by him which the County reim
bursed him for.
A number of receipts are of such
a character that we are at quite a
loss to understand how any board
of County Commissioners would pay
the same, and we believe that it
would be well for you to scrutenize
them.
SHERIFF—Covering a period
from the second Monday in January,
1909, to the second Monday in Jan
uary, 1911, and from second Monday
in January, 1913, to the second Mon
day in January, 1915, Frank M.
Breshears, Sheriff.
We find that there is a balance
due the county of $30 for Sheriff's
deeds, and that the fees from fifty
cases, as per charts attached, do not
show in the fee book.
We find that the Oregon Short
Line Railroad issued passes to the
Sheriffs of Canyon County as fol
lows:
To W. H. Thorp, 1907-8, to Frank
Breshears in 1909-10, to J. W. Wat
kins in 1911-12, and to Frank Bres
hears in 1913.
The pass issued to Frank Bre
shears in 1910 was not used by him
during the period May 10th to July
9th, and the pass issued to him in
1913 was cancelled on the 13th day
of May, that year, and there were no
passes issued during the year 1914.
In view of the fact that these
Sheriffs had these passes, we are at
a loss -to understand why the trans
portation bills presented by them
are so large.
COUNTY CLERK, AUDITOR, AND
RECORDER—Covering a period
from the second Monday in January,
1907, to the second Monday in Janu
ary, 1911, O. V. Badley, auditor.
We find by the booksMhat there is
a balance due the county of $306.42,
as shown by the charts attached.
We have come to the conclusion,
after carefully looking over Mr.
Badley's books, that there was a
woeful lack of appreciation of his
duties and responsibilities while he
held the office.
We found that the assessment roll
of 1907 had not been extended in
many cases into the total tax col
umn, neither had the roll been foot
ed up and charged to the tax col
lector as provided by the law. We
also found that the assessment rolls
for 1808. 1909 and 1910 had not been
fooled up according to the require
ments of the law. As a matter of
fact, the Auditor's work upon the
four different assessment rolls was
not of a permanent character in
many cases, the total amount of the
tax due from various people being
entered in pencil, and in many cases
erased and new amounts substitut
ed, sometimes for larger, and some
times for smaller amounts.
From all appearances, we believe
it is a fair statement when we say
that the office was run on the bas
.s of least resistance. In order to
avoid any misunderstanding, we will
slate that about the only thing that
we found during Ibis term of office
which was taken care of properly
was the salaries, which apparently
were drawn promptly.
If he, as auditor, had properly
charged G. H. Moore, tax collector
of the years 1907 and 1908, with tho
amount of the roll which was turn
ed over to him to collect, the bal
ance duo the county at the present
time of over $5,000 from Mr. Mooro
would not have occurred.
We desire to call the attention or
the Board to tho foo which was
charged by Auditor Badley when
recording over six hundred water
contracts during the term of hi3
office. Tho amount charged was
$.20 each, but it appears to us that
the proper charge would have been
between $3 and $5 each. This would
indicato an apparent loss to tho
County of over $2,000.
COUNTY CLERK, AUDIIOR, AND
RECORDER—Covering a period
from the second Monday in January,
19(1. to the second Monday in Jan
uary, (915, George W. Stovel, Aud
itor.

TAYLOR ANNOUNCES CANDI
DACY FOR GOVERNOR
Lieutenant Governor Taylor Flings
Hat Into Ring at Spokane.
Lieutenant Governor Herman n.
Taylor announced himself a candidate
for the Republican nomination for
governor at Spokane Tuesday. Mr.
Taylor has had the project under mu d
for several months but was awaiting
the opportune time for making the
announcement Lieutenant Governor
Taylor evidently concluded that the
eve of the Republican state conven
tion was the time.
FEAR THAT WHIFFIN MAY
NOT LAND "FFICE OF
Ü. S.
GRAND OLD MAN OF PARMA
DECLARES HIM UTTERLY
INCOMPETENT — DEMO
CRATS ARE FILING
PROTEST AGAINST
APPOINTMENT
Buckner is Being Made the Goat—
Men Higher Up Just as Responsible
as He For Action in Which he was
Merely the Tool—Nothing Left for
Him But to Apply the Screws at the
Proper Moment—Nugent and Wal
ters Said to Have Conspired to Dis
franchise the Local Jeffersonian
Brethren.
The Parma Herald states that C. W!
Whiffin is utterly incompetent for the
position of United States Surveyor
General. This opinion seems to be
the opinion of Democrats generally.
They claim that Mr. Whiffin wanted
an office and this office was the only
one available. In view of this condi
tion there was nothing for Charley to
do but become a candidate for survey
or even though he did not know
transit theodolite from a perambula
tor. It is understood that Democrats
are tiling protests against the appoint
ment of Mr. Whiffin on the grounds
that he is unqualified.
Mr. Whiffin is a licensed surveyor.
During the past few months he has
taken a course under the tutorage of
Mr. I'red A. Wilkie of Boise, a civil
engineer and brother-in-law of Mr.
Whiffin. It is stated by friends, and
believed by Mr. Whiffin himself, that
the instructions he has received from
Mr. Wilkie during the past few
months handsomely qualify him for
the position of United States Surveyor
General for Idaho. Naturally and
without training at all Mr. Whiffin can
draw his salary as gracefully as any
of them.
It is feared by Mr. Whiffin's friends
that Messrs. Nugent, Elder and
Pence, in view of what has happened,
will feel under no obligation to se
cure for Mr. Whiffin the appointment.
Indeed with Ponce, Elder and Nugent
indifferent, if not quietly antagonistic,
and other Democrats fighting hiin in
the open, there is a very good chance
that Mr. Whiffin will never see the
office of Surveyor General as the em
cumbcnt of the office. Of course these
speculations as to whether Mr. Whif
fin will land are to be taken for what
they are worth. The news is that the
speculations are being speculated by
Democrats of a speculative turn of
mind.
An observer of current events, a
young man of deep sympathy with
Democrats generally and Mr. Thos.
E. Buckner specifically, states that Mr.
Buckner is entitled to more considera
tion than he is receiving on account of
the action taken by the Democratic
County Central Committee. This ob
server states that Mr. Buckner had
confederates and confreres who
should not be allowed to escape un
scathed. It is not right to make Mr
Buckner the goat. In fact he is en
titled to respect for doing a very dis
agreeable task.
It is pointed out that Hon. John I'
Nugent visited Caldwell a few days
before the meeting of the county
central committee. Mr. Nugent and
Mr. T. A. Walters are supposed to
have been in deep consultation and
to have agreed upon the method to
be employed. Mr. Walters, be it re
membered, is» another appointee of
Governor Alexander. 11is suspect
ed of having conspired with Mr. Xu
gent and having engineered the deal
whereby the local Democrats were
disfranchised, disfellowshipped and
finally kicked down stairs, or rathe
up stairs in this particular instance
It is also pointed out that Mr. Buck
ner must have consulted with the
countv chairman, Mr. I). G. Ruby
with the local agent of Pence, hide
and Nugent, Mr. Walter Griffiths, and
with others of standing in the party
Such being the supposition it is un
just that Mr. Buckner alone bear the
odium. .. ,
The Tribune is inclined to think
that Mr. Buckner is entitled to
modicum of sympathy. He is being
blamed for many things done, but
for which lie was only the instrument
In this light Mr. Buckner is not shown
to be so bad. He simply did that
which he and several others, in thei
wisdom, had decided was the best
thing to do. Occupying the position
he occupied he had to put the screws
when the time came,for placing those
interesting little devices.
First Baptist Church.
Passion Week is" being observed at
the Baptist church. On Thursday
night the Lord's Supper will be ad
ministered in commemoration ot the
first Lord's Supper established on the
night of the Passover. The service
will culiminate on Easter Sunday. On

Easter Music will be rendered. In
the evening there will be an Easter
concert, consisting of dialogues, reci
tations, and songs rendered by the
Sunday school. This service will be
especially interesting and the general
public is cordially invited.
On next Monday evening, April t*
there will be a special program at
the Brotherhood meeting. The school
children and the garden work will
have the first place. Fathers are es
pecially invited.— F. E. Dark, minister.

CONFIDENT THAT BRIDGE
OVER SNAKE WILL BE BUILT
A committee selected from residents
of the Gem Irrigation District recent
ly appeared before the board of coun
ty commissioners of Owyhee county
for the purpose of presenting the mat
ter of county aid for a bridge across
Snake river between Nampa and Fro
man ferries. The committee reported
that they had secured notes from
residents of their section and nearby I
communities amounting to over
000.00.
The commissioners of Owyhee I
county were greatly interested in the
proposed bridge but stated that there
were no funds at their disposal for
aiding the proposition at this time.
They promised that the matter would
be taken up at the July meeting- of I
the board, and they hoped that at that
time to be able to help. The neces
sity for the bridge appealed to the
board. Every member is perfectly
willing to do anything and everything
in his power.
The bridge committee had previous
ly appeared before the board of coun
ty commissioners of Canyon county
and had likewise received encourage
ment.
Bridge Will Be Built.
_
It is now certain that the bridge
across Snake river at a point between
the two ferries will be built in the
near future. The people of the Gem
District, of Owyhee county above the
Gem and of Canyon county are great
ly interested in the prmiosed bridge.
The business men of Caldwell have
promised to help raise the funds. It
understood that business men
Nampa are also interested.

Farm Also Raided.
Three farm animals also disappear
ed Sunday night from the ranch of
Peter Laim, located between here and
Nampa. Though Mr. Lann is not yet
fully convinced that the horses were
stolen he reported his fears in the
matter to the sheriffs office Monday
evening.
There are some grounds for believ
ing that th. same party who stole the
steed in Caldwell may have driven |
away the farm animals.
Clew is Found.
Tied behind the saddle of the Kipp
horse was a heavy black and gray
plaid mackinaw. The garment was
found Monday morning on the slaugh
ter-house road, something more than
a mile west of Caldwell
On both Monday and Tuesday the
sheriff's automobile was kept hum
ming over the roads between here
and the Snake river ferries ,but as yet
no trace of the thief has been found
The theory is now advanced that the
culprit purposely threw away the
maciciiiaw . west of town and then |
turned his course and went eastward.

PUBLICITY COMMITTEE
MAKES PLANS FOR
ENSUING YEAR
COMMUNITY ON EVE OF GREAT
COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT
AND PLANS ARE LAID TO
ATTRACT MANUFACTUR
ING PLANTS TO CITY
OF CALDWELL
R®P° r * s Sh°w that Committees
Done Good Work During Past
Twelve Months—Cannery and Con
densed Milk Plant Under Consid
eration by Financiers—State Fair
Receives Attention—Good Roads
and Various Civic Improvements
Under Discussion—Committee Will
Be Busy From Now On.
That Caldwell and tributary terri
tory is on the eve of great commercial
development was the opinion express
e d by members of the publicity and
development committee at a meeting
held in the Commercial Club rooms
Tuesday. The committee adopted a
tentative development program for the
ensuing year which will be submitted
to the subscribers of the 1916-1917
fund.
Under the direction of the present
committee more than 12,000 pieces of
literature descriptive of Caldwell and
tributary territory have been distribut
ed to prospective homeseekers during
the last twelve months resulting in
Caldwell securing a large influx of de
sirable settlers. The committee has
in addition to the advertising cam
and money in local development, con
ventions and other matters of purely
local interest.
The general opinion expressed by
the members of the committee was
that the present year should be one
of substantial industrial growth for
Caldwell and that it was quite prob
able that manufacturing plants which
would utilize the raw product of this
section would be established during
the next year. It is known that men
of financial means are contemplating
the establishment of a cannery and
condensed milk plant in the Boise Val
ley and a determined effort will be
*^ la ^ e ,hy tjie local committee to secure
their location here.
The plans of the committee in ad
dition to the effort to be made to se
cure the factories include a continua
tion of the advertising and irrigation
develonment campaigns; road work;
the securing of conventions; civic im
provements, and the successful per
petuation of the Idaho State Fair.
President Zeh has appointed Messrs.
F. M. Cole, W. P. Lyon ; E. H. Plow
head; W. P. Kelleher; J. H. Gipson;
E. A. Wheeler; J. M. Lewis; W. G.
