TWO MORE ARE TO BE TRII9
Juries Take Only Few Minutes to
Decide That Mexicans Captured
at Columbus are Guilty.
It took a Liiiiii county jury juat
twenty minutes to find a verdict of
"guilty of murder iu the first degree'
iiguiiist .Inn a Ruugel, Etisevio Rn
teria, Tinirino Gnicia, Jos, Kodri
cue, rrancisco Alsarvs and Juan
Castillo for their participation in the
( olumbiis raid March H. Argument
in the ease were completed abortl)
before noon yesterday and few
minutes past noon the jury filed back
into the court room with their ver
d el. The prisoners were given
fair and secdy trial. The case wa
iiH iied Wednesday morning and the
enteiice of the court will be paaaed
next Monday. As the crime carries
the death penally, the execution by
hanging will take place at the local
lail within the next thirty duya un
lcs a stay of execution is secured.
The alternative is unlikely.
Die prosecution was conducted by
tissiMunt district uttoniev J. S,
aught and the defense bv Buell
Wood of Currixoxo, The state u.
troduced the testimony of Constable
i. ,. iniwey, i. K. Leinmon, ji..
Sam Knvcl, Lund rilmore of the l.
Army, H. S. Aguirre and I A.
R'gus nil of Columbus. The testi
niouy brought out the details of the
r uil and tended to indeiitifv the de
fendants with it. By their own at.
mission, they were pan of the Villa
commiinii ami at the lime were
wounded by American soldiers. The
dclcihlnnts were put on the stand in
their own behalf and their testimony
went no further than to show that
they wcii- forced into Villa service
and bud no knowledge that they were
morion n soil and taking part in
the commission of a felony whereby
murder was committed. Counsel for
for tin defense and the prosecuting
attorney amplified these points in
their arguments. Judge Medler gave
the jury lengthy instructions, point
ing out that the prisoners might be
found guilty no mutter how small
their connection with the uctual kil
ling. The prisoners were brought into
court dressed iu blue denim shirts
and overalls furnished them by the
county. All were wounded und onlv
tw uld stand up when the indict
ment was read. One wus brought in
lying on a col. The court room was
crowded most of the time, many wo
men being among the s(eetiitors. The
pri-oiicr made no sign when the
court interpreter made known to them
the verdict.
"Jariindo del nuierte" (journey of
death), is the way the six Villa pris
oners cupturerf wounded near El vat
ic in Mexico by I'nilcd States troops,
deocribed their advent into Denung
Sunday from Columbus under the
charge of She rin" W. C. Simpson of
Luna county. The indictments
charge the prisoners with the murder
of James T. Dean. Charles D. Miller,
I'iiiiI Simon and J. J. Moore. Fran
cisco Villa was indicted at the ftame
lime on the two counts before men
tioned, and if captured will no doubt
be tried in Deniiug.
Attorney Wood of the defense had
his first consultation with the prig
oners nt the jail Tuesday morning.
One of the men caught at El Valle
was an orderly to Villa and was
present at the Columbus raid and the
Santa Ysabel massacre. At first the
men would not converse confident
ially with the counsel, but when they
understood the full significance of
flic service which it is his duty to
rentier, they agreed to tell the atory
fully and did so using the orderly
as sMikesman.
There is some sculntion here a.
fo what attitude the administration
w ill take toward the executions. The
iMisstiiie that the department may
seen lo nave me executions stayed,
... . . .. .... . . .
No doubt, military development will .
I kit i Luna county jury could be
traated to see impartial justice done.
There is intense interest, however, ..
tb executions. The men with two;
exceptions illiterate and are no
more accountable for their actions in
the popular extimation than the vie i
ions cyclone. The failure to can
tur the leaders that plotted the
raid, is responsible for this feel in..
Shortly before court took recess at
noon Wednesday afternoon until ft
o'clock that evening, the slate rested
its base.
There are three others in jail who
will lie tried on u like charge for
participation in the raid of the Villa
force on Columbus. The three vet
to be tried were taken during or im
mediately following the raid. Their
names are Juan Snncbex, Pablo Suii-
chei, and Jasus Puis.
An agent of the department of jus.
tiee tried yesterday morning to hnvt
the case continued, but Judge Medler
could see no reason for granting the
request. Although the agent remain
ed in the city until the end of the trial
he made no furthei representations
The airent argued that the mnttcr
of jurisdiction was involved. Jmkv
Medler pointed out that the prisoner-
had been fur. d over by the nc'litnn
authorities to the civil uiitborltic
and indicted in a regular wnv ami
that he could see no grounds for the
ontentinn. Judge Medler answered
a like request in the snme manner
which reached him by phone from
S. Attorney Biirklinrt at Albn
luerqiir, inviting thnl official fit be
present nt the trial to see that full
justice was done.
The following are the names of
the jurors: B. R. Wood, Louis
Dombuseh, Wrigh Shaw. Sim Ilol

Juan Siiiicheis, the .event h Villisln
nifbr .to be tried for complicity in
the Columbus fight, was nt 4 o'lock
yesterday afternoon found guilty of
murder in the first degree by a jury
that was ant thirty minutes. Snn-
chei' trial began at 2 o'clock. Tlu

The Mexican dead were accounted

The American punitive eXH-ilitiuii
