Wilson issues Ultimatum In The

Submarine Controversy
Methods Must Be Changed Orlplo-

Relations
&
Washlngton, April 20. President
Wilson's uoto, to Germany makes the
same demand upon Germany that was
outlined In tho president's address to
congress. Germany must immediate
ly declare and effect an abandonment
of its present methods of submarine
warfare against passenger and freight
carrylrig bhlps or the United States
will sever diplomatic relations. The
note contains almost precisely the
same language as the message, with
few evidences of diplomatic toning
down.
At the state department the presl-.
dent's demand Is interpreted to mean
that Germany must abandon Its sub
marine campaign against merchant
shipping altogether. The German em
bassy interprets the note to mean that
present methods must be abandoned
and that less rigorous methods of sub
marine warfare or more discrimina
tion in attacks on neutral shlpB woulfi
meet the president's demand. -Uator
tunately, officials point out the presi-1
dent's message and "nls note aro both
ambiguous In this regard.
The note leaves Germany an oppor
tunity to reply that the Imperial gov
ernment will endeavor to conform to
Wilson's demand by a jevlsion of tho
rules now governing the -warning of
passenger ships and merchantmen
and by agreeing adequately to pro
vide for the safety of the crews.
There are Indications that Germany
might agree to do this.
To Avert Break.
Count Von Bernstorff will make a
final effort to avert a diplomatic break
bj reopening negotiations along these
lines. Officials here said that nego
tiations might he reopened, provided
Germany immediately declared and
effected an abandonment of its sub
marine warfare before these negotia
tions were undertaken; In other
words, if Germany will agree to hold
lte submarine campaign In abeyance
while it is negotiating with tho Unit
ed States, there would bo no disposi
tion upon the part ot the United
States government to press matterb
unduly. But It -was made clear that
an Immediate cessation of Germany's
submarine campaign was tho only
contingency on which the matter
oould be reopened. There is giave
doubt here whether the imperial gov.
ernment will agree to this, and if it
refuses a break seems almost Inevit
able. The word "Immediately" In the
president';: domand is likely to be the
outstanding feature so far as Ger
many Ib concernod. Count Von Born
etorff has not, o course, had time to
innrti nfilninllv Mr covemment's
views, but he understands pretty well ,
whn nprlln'n att tude will be. He 18,
understood to despair of any Immedl

campaign of reprisal.
Fateful Words.
This is tho wording ot the demand
that the president in IiIb note makes
upon Gormany; "Unless tho Imperial
government should now immediately
declare and effect an abandonment of
Its present methods of submarine war
fare against passenger and freight
carrying vessels, tho government of
n un,lea B'alf CB" " ay """"
but to sever diplomatic relations with
UP
GERMANY
ill Be
i
the German empire altogether."
The American note to Berlin de
clares: "The government of the United
States has been very patient. It has
accepted the successive explanations
nnd assurances of the Imperial gov
ernment as of course given in entire
sincerity and good faith, and has
hoped even againbl hope, that It
would prove to be possible for the
imperial government so to order and
control the acts of its naval com
manders as to square its policy with
the recognized principles of humanity
r-j embodied in the law of nations. It
lias made every allowance for unpte
tedented conditions and has been
willing to wait until the facts became
unmistakable and were susceptible ot
unly one interpretation.
"It now owes It to a just regard
for its own rights to say to the Im
perial government that that time has
come.
"It has become painfully evident to
U that the position which It tools at
the very outset Is inevitable, namely
tlio use ot submarines for the destruc
t.on of an enemy's commerce Is of
necessity because of the very charac
ter of the vessels employed and the
ery methods jf attack which their
employment of course involves, utter
ly incompatible with the principles of
humanity, the long established and
incontrovertible rights of neutrals
and the sacred immunities of non
combatants. "If It is still the purpose of the Im
perial government to prosecute re
lentless and indiscriminate warfare
against vessels of commerce by the
use of submarines, without regard to
what the government of the United
Slates must consider the sacred and
indisputable rules of International
law and the universally recognized
dictates of humanity, the government
of the United States Is at last forced
to the conclusion that there Is hut
cne course It can pursue.
"Unless the imperial government
should now immediately declare and
effect an abandonment of its present
methods of submarine warfare against
passenger and freight carrying ves
sels, tho government of tho United
States can have no choice but to
sever diplomatic relations with tho
German empire altogether. This ac-
! tion the government ot the United
States contemplates with the great
est reluctance, but feels constrained
to take in behalf of humanity and the
rights of neutral nations."
The Sussex Case.

tion declares, -lonslders the torpedo

the evidence, but actually substantlat-

few days an urgent demand tor a re

tho United States government, ac

Count Von Bernstorff, the German
embassador, was at the state depart
ment today. He regards the prospects
of adjusting the matter as almost an
Impossibility, but Is determined to
fight to the end. He has not heard
from his government and entertnlns
little hopo that Germany will agree
to abandon the submarine warfare
against merchant shipping. The note
contains evidence that the Su3rfex

WILSON'S ADDRESS
FAVORABLY RECEIVED
Submarine Issue Tiiorouglity
Aired Before Congress,
Washington, April 20. While Pres
ident Wilson's address In the main
was favorably received by congress,
there was some adverse comment by
seme Republicans and dissatisfaction
on tho part of some Democrats. The
president was criticised by some be
cause he sent his note to Germany be
fore he had taken congress into his
Mnfidence. Those members of con
gress say the president promised to
take no decisive action without in
forming congress nnd that he failed
to lay the matter before the legisla
tive bod until It was too late for
congress to act
Most of the leaders, Democratic
r.nd Republican, thought the president
hardly could do less, and some ex
pressed I he opinion that his action
would not lead to war. Republican
Leader Alann openly attacked tho
president for his stand. He charac
terized It as a political play.
Both Hie president's address and
the American note declare in unequiv
ocal terms that only by Germany's
acceding to the demar.d can the break
ing off ot relations altogether be pre
sented. In hlB address before congress tho
president concluded as follows: "I
have deemed it my duty to say to the
imperial government that'll it Is stil'

Coming of General Hugh Scott Await

Anti-American Demonstration at
Torreon District Around San P&
dro Cleared of Bandits.
El Paso, Tex., April 20. The Amer
ican forces In the state ot Chihuahua
rtmaln stationary, It Is stated, await'
ing reinforcements from the United
States, ordered under way by General
runcton to enable General Pershing
to lengthen his line of communication
in the hunt for Villa. The coming
of General Hugh L Scott, chief of
staff. Is awaited with interest, as the
army believes some new steps will
be taken after the cnief of staff thor
oughly familiarizes himself with tha
situation.
A message from General Pershing's
headquarters, passed by the censor,
quoted General Pershing as saying
the expedition may be extended many
months if It is not true Villa is dead
and that it may be necessary to or
ganize an elaborate secret service
system in order to hunt him down.
Carrania. troops were employed in;
dispersing crowds that had gathered,
for an anti-American demonstration:
In Torreon. Proclamations had been
itsued at Torreon, Laredo and Gomez
Palacio. calling on all loyal Mexicans
to meet In a theater at Gomez Palo
cio to discuss steps to be taken,
against the American invaders. Brit
ish Vice Consul O'Hea promptly re
ported the circumstance to General
Trevlno, who immediately took com
mand of the situation. The proclama
tions calling for the meeting ended'
with the words: "Viva Mexico and
death to the Gringoes."
General Santos from Parral reports
he has dispersed Chacon's bandit
band. He said last Sunday Chacon
killed Simon Reyes' son In a dispute.
The Laguna district around San Pe
dro has been cleared of bandits, Gen
eral Matins Ramos says.
NO DECISION REACHED
At to the Withdrawal of American
Troops From Mexico.
Washington, April 20. No decision.
at to withdrawal of American troops,
from Mexico is expected for a weelc
or ten days, unless there are new out
breaks against the forces in Moxlco--tc
compel Immediate action. This was.
made clear when Secretary Baker
dispatched Major General Hugh L.
Scott, chief of staff, to the border as
his personal representative to make a.
complete report on the military prob
lems confronting General Funston.
The administration's final action on
General Carranza's suggestion that
the expedition be recalled probably
will be based largely on what is
shown in this report.
Secretary Baker described General
Scott's mission as being to assemolo
complete information as to the bor
der situation for the use of the de
partment. Accompanied by his aide, Lieuten
ant Colonel Robert E. L. Michle or
the general staff, General Scott will
reach General Fnnston's headquarters
at San Antonio Friday evenln;.
Mr. Baker laid stress in his an
nouncement on the fact that General
Funston still is in supreme command
of the border situation and expedi
tionary forces and will remain so. Ho
said the department fully approved
every step General Funston has
taken.
Roosevelt On Wilson's Course.
New York. April 0. Colonel Itoose
volt gave out a statement saying if
Germany now does as President Wil
son demands, it will prove that Ger
many would have given in when he
wrote the strict accountability note
H he had taken the proper position at
that time, thus preventing the Lubi
tania disaster and removing the pres
ent cause of friction. And if Germany
does not do as the president demands,
the colonel said, the strict account
ability note Is unpardonable.
