can go no further in her subma-
rine concessions to the United
States, Admiral von Holtzen
dorff, chief of the German ad-1
miralty staff, declared in an in
terview with this correspondent
today.
"But remember." said the
German naval head later during
the course of the interview,
"that we have no desire for a
break with the United States.
That would be insanity. We
shall not bring it about, despite
our desire to push vigorously our
submarine war."
We did not sink the Sussex,' said
Admiral von Holtzendurff. "I am as
much convinced of that as of anything
which has happened in this war. If
you could read the definite instruc
tions, the exact orders each submarine
mm man der has. you would under
stand that the torpedoing of the Sus
sex was impossible.

"Many of our submarines have re

was carrying war munitions for the
allies.
"We have definitely agreed to warn
the crews ;md passengers of passenger

vision in every way but we cannot be
asked to regard freight ahips In the

'order for any belligerent nation.

snips since the beginning of the sub

not go farther.

"Five months mure will see what
we i an do to the British shipping.
The ring around the British Isles will
mow tighter and tighter. Then we
hall se whether England will still
maintain that she cannot make peace
until Germany is destroyed.

"THE BANKERS STORY."
( Relating how .John It. Mulvane on-e
threw out a StHte Journal cheek for $3-74 ;
afterwards cashing one for $ir.000.)
There hi no more important man in
a community than the banker; in fact,
he is often the most important. He
furnishes the means with which the
merchant and the manufacturer are
able to produce business and follow
their callings. Even the head of an
important mercantile establishment
M ith large capital, often must needs
call upon the banker for additional !
funds to enable him not only to make
progress, but to actually maintain and
merely keep alive the enterprise he
has constructed.
The banker encourages thrift; he is
a practical example of it himself. No
man ever became a good banker un
less he was thrifty. The youth of To
peka should make a note of this.
The banking business is baaed al
most wholly upon confidence. No one
Who Speaks falsely has a good rating:
at the bankers; no one who practices
deception, or who is known to he (
tricky in business affairs, has much
standing at the bank on the corner. It
hi difficult for the careless business '
man. one who does not meet his notes .
promptly on the day they are due. and '
otherwise conduct himself in a busi
ness like manner, to negotiate a new
loan or extend an old one.
A banker, banks more upon the in
tegrity and the ability of the man than
he does upon his dollars. He may lose
his dollars, hut his honesty and skill
will enable him to get them back, if
the banker helps him over a bad road. ,
and t he banker Will do that pretty
nearly every time, if the man deserves
it and Is worthy of trust.
Topeka, we are proud to say, has
many good bankers; in fact, we don't .
know any bad ones in the iot.
The capital stock of all our banks
and the two trust companies who !
wrote to the county board last week,
aggregate over a million dollars and
the deposits in those institutions are
fourteen and a half millions. They
have a surplus of over a half a mil
lion. ' !

tia and Volunteers.
Be Reaily for Aetlon When
(leruiany Makes Reply.
New York, April 21. A retired
army officer whose name is withheld
for obvious reasons made the follow
ing statement here concerning the
mobilization of the national guard and
retired officers:
"Practically every army officer re
cently retired and all other who are
not physically disabled are now under
orders to hold themselves ready for
service. They probably will be order
ed back into the service as leaders of
the militia and volunteers and pro
moted to higher rank.
"Very recently retired officers have
been ordered to report their where
abouts to the war department and also
the condition of their health. Many
already have consulted army surgeons
and undergone tests as to their phys
ical fitness to return to the service.
ST. G. Gets Ready.
"Orders have been issued to the na
tional guard of New York and other
states to get ready. Mobilization is
practically under way. Companies
are being recruited to their full
strength. Regiment units are being
centralized.
"No reply from Germany is expected
for a week fir ten days. It is the wish
of the war department that the na
tional guard be ready for action by
that time."
If. V. Pledges Support to U. S.
Albany, N. Y.. April 21. The state
of New York, through its legislature,
last night pledged to President Wilson
all its resources of men and material
in the event of war with Germany. A
resolution was adopted by both houses
at their final session last evening.
that all nassenger ships now going to
fc-ngland carry war munitions; not
nee r lira rily ammunition and shells, but !
articles which are much more neces- I
sary to help England to continue the
war."
"Has Germany lost any submarines i
since March 1?- (The dav when the
new submarine campaign against
armed merchantmen opened.) I asked.
"Yes." was the frank reply.
"Do you know how they were lost?"
Admiral Von Holtzendorff was asked.
Sink 200.0(10 I n. my Tons.
"No. we don't always hear when
one of our submarines is lost. We j
don't always know whether they had
. fair chance or not when they at
tempted to sink ships, surrounded as
they are with such strict orders."
"What has been the success o the!
new submarine warfare so far?" he '
was asked.
"In March more than 200.000 en- I
emy tons were destroyed by sub- I
marines and mines on enemy coasts,"
was the response.
Admiral von Holtzzendorff is filled I
with energy and spirit. When he
talks he is the most serious official in ;
Germany. His whole body vibrates
with energy. Every word carries con- '
viction because he speaks so frankly,
so unhesitatingly, that one feels he
is speaking out Instead of Jotting
down his notes beforehand to make n 1
impression.
During the entire interview he sat
erect in his leather chair, his eyes di
rectly on the interviewer, his remarks
coming suddenly with a punch, like
shots from a cannon.

Sat ( lose Together at Revival
to Pass Notes, She Says.
Mrs. Stella Azlein, twenty-five years
of age, married eight years and the
mother of three little children, took
the witness stand in the court of To
peka today and retold the story upon
which W. 10. Atchison, county attor
ney, is basing a charge of "white
slavery" against H. D. Hamilton, a
bridegroom of three days.
ESariy this week Hamilton, who un
til then was a well-to-do widower of
Oakland, married Mrs M. M. Fair, a
widow with one child. Hamilton is
the father of two children, one four
teen and one eleven years of age. The
"white slave" case, brought two weeks
ago, is the outgrowth of neighborhood
talk in Oakland involving Mrs. Azlein
and Hamilton. The action was started
by S- F. Azlein, the husband, who is
a machinist in the Santa Fe shops.
Mr. and Mrs. Azlein and their three
children were in the courtroom. The
new Mrs. Hamilton was not present.
Ed Itooney. one of Hamilton's attor
neys, said she was at home taking
care of the childien The courtroom,
back of the railing, was filled with
neighbors ot the two families. If they
went to the courtroom to get first
hand information on a neighborhood
scandal, they were not disappointed,
for Mrs. Azlein told the story from
start to finish without quibbling over
phrases or terms used.
Mrs- Azlein was a vindictive witness
and on two occasions ignored the at
torney for the defendant and turned
questioner. She shot questions over
the shoulder of the attorney at Ham
ilton. Witness Asks Questions.
"You said," she shot at Hamilton,
"you was too old a man to tell. You
asked me what I thought your gray

Demanded Tribute.
Chicago. April 21. Mrs. Louise
Osborne Rowe, commissioner of pub
lic welfare of Chicago, was found not
guilty by the civil service commission
last night, of the charge that rhe com
pelled Mrs. Page Waller Eaton, a
superintendent, to contribute a third
of $3,000 a year salary to an alleged
political fund.
Mrs. Eaton charged Mrs. Rowe col
lected the tribute in monthly install
ments on the pretext first that it was
to gp to the support of a "destitute
sister-in-law of Mayor William Hale
Thompson" and later that it was for
a fund to help the mayor recuperate
from his financial losses during the
cam paign.
Mrs. Rowe declared the charges
were part of a political conspiracy to
injure the mayor. The position occu
pied by Mrs. Eaton was abolished
shortly before her charges were
brought.

MORElFFRANCE
Russia Contemplates Sending
Quarter Million Soldiers.
Has More Men Than .Munitions
France the Reverse.
Marseilles, April 21. The arrival of
the transports that brought the Rus- f
sian troops, sent to join the entente
forces on the western front, had been
expected since Tuesday but a heavy
storm in the Mediterranean delayed
their reaching here until yesterday.
Every precaution for their protec- ;
tion had been taken owing to reports
that hostile submarines were operating
in the Mediterranean but the voyage
was concluded without untoward in- '
cident.
The coming of Russian troops to the
western front has been talked of by
military people for two or three
months. The reason, as now explained,
is that it is easier for Russia to arm
and supply fighting material to Rus
sian troops on the western front than
on the eastern.
Russia still has many hundred
thousand more men under training
than she can use on her fighting lines
because the Russian problem con
tinned to be not how to get men, but
munitions- The allies can obviously
provide complete equipment for Rus
sians more easily in France than by
shipping to Russia. Possibly a quar
ter of a million men will be sent into
France this spring.
The Russian troops which reached
Marseilles yesterday continue to be
the center of enthusiastic demonstra
tion from crowds at Camp Mirabeau,
where the newly arrived force is quar
tered. The Russians show no ill ef
fects of their long journey. Officers
of the Russian forces are the reci
pients of rounds or receptions and
of congratulatory telegrams form !
many allied quarters. The authorities 1

Washington. D. C, April 21.
Additional indictment of German
sympathizers in this country will be
asked by the department of justice
as a result of revelations made by
Horst von der Goltz, alleged German
spy brought to New York by Scotland
Yards detectives. This was learned
authoritatively here today. Von der
Goltz's statement was paid by depart
ment officials to have opened a "field
practically without limits." for inves
tigation. The government will follow
every clue. It was understood that the
number of men involved in von der
Goltz's activities in the t'nited States
is much larger than had been thought
heretofore.
The pending New York indictments
against five of von Goltxe assistants
were said to embrace the alleged lead
ers in the conspiracy to blow up the
canat but indictment of men involved
in minor ways in the alleged con
spiracy, probably will be sought soon.
It was understood indictment will be
asked also in connection with von der
Goltz's other activities.

The state and justice departments
announced today the government's
willingness to return to the German
embassy all the papers seized in New
York with the arrest of Wolfe von
Igel, which Count von Bernstorff will
identify as official. Photographs of
the seized documents have been made
and will be retained. Count von Bern
storff protested vigorously against the
taking of the papers and it was at
the state department that Secretary
Lansing was considering the necessity
of an official apology.

patch from Ymuiden, says the Dutch
steamship Lodewijik Vannassau was

down in six minutes. Five of her
crew were drowned- Thirty-six sur
vivors have been landed at Ymuiden.
The Lodewijk Vannassau sailed
from Chile in February with a cargo
of salt petre for Rotterdam. A Ber
lin wireless dispatch of April 9 says
she had been held up in the Downs
by the British authorities since March
2'Z, and that her detention had aroused
public opinion in Holland as the Dutch
farmers feared the salt petre would
arrive too late for use this spring. The
vessel was built in 1913 and owned
in Amsterdam. She was 325 feet
long. Her gross tonnage was 3,397.

I Fear U-Boat Attack Meanwhile

Washington, April 21. Word from
Ambassador Gerard at Berlin that he
had delivered the Americn note to
the German government and some tn
dedication from him as to how it was
received, was awaited with keen ex
pectancy by administration officiaJs
today. Unofficial advices early today
saying that he had presented the com
munication to the German foreign of
fice last evening and that the chan
cellor had not seen it because of his
absence at army headquarters, were
read with interest by officials.
Pending Germany's reply to Amer
ica's demands that she immediately
abandon the present methods of con
ducting submarine warfare, one of the
chief concerns of officials here is the
possibility of another attack on a ship
carrying Americans. It was admitted
that an Immediate rupture could only
be prevented by proof that Germany
had been unable t6 communicate with
her submarine commanders. r
long the United States is willing to
wait for the German reply haa not
been disclosed. It is suggested that
the German foreign office may be de

of a series of religious holidays in
Germany which begin today and con

Bryan Goes to Capital.
Former Secretary of State Bryan,

th-it "it would be a crime to enter the
present war.'1
"The responsibility for declaring
war is upon congress, not upon the
president," declared Mr. Bryan, "and
it is fair to assume that when the
duty of acting falls upon congress, the
president will be willing to refrain
from embarrassing congress as he was
anxious that he should not be embar
rassed." He suggests arbitration of any quar
rel that may be had with any Euro
pean nation.

Report of Villa's Death.

April 21. American military author
ities detailed to Investigate the report
that the body recently disinterred at
San Boria was that of Pancho Villa,
reported today they were unable to
obtain confirmation. No details were
given which would tend to throw,
Hght on the situation.
Chihuahua, April 21. The body
supposedly Villa's proved to be that
of a Villista but not the bandit leader
himself. The report that the bandit
leader's corpse had been exhumed was
positively stamped as false today by
General Luis Gutierrez, military com
mander here.
This and official American reports
that Villa Is In Durango state un
bounded were disclosed, together with
a Carransa order of April IB, prohibit
ing United States aviators flying over
Mexican cities and barring the Amer
ican forces from using Mexican tele
graph and telephone lines.
Scores of shots were fired at the
American who made a flight over the
city Wednesday.
Resentment of the Mexican soldiers
and populace against the continued
presence of the American troops is
becoming so general that Carranza
military authorities declare they will
be unable to control the people unless
the expedition ia Soon withdrawn.
Letcher Tells of Hostility.
Consul Lietcher reported to Wash
ington that the Parral incident was
not an Isolated case. Other attacks
on American troops by the In
habitants of Mexioan towns are be
lieved to have occurred.
The bandit whose life was spared
when he promised to point out Villa's
burial place, led the Carranza sol
diers to a grave but the body was net
Villa's.
"I never did consider the report as
having any foundation," said Gutier
rez. "In fact. I do not know whether
Villa is dead or alive. For daya I
have been unable to secure any defi
nite information as to his where
abouts." Reports to Consul Letcher assert
that Villa probably was not in the
Guerrero battle in which he was re
ported by the Carranza authorities to
havs been wounded.
A number of Americans who came
here to Investigate the reported
death of Villa andjldentify his body.
