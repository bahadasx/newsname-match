EIGHTH DEMAND MADE
FOR VON IGEL PAPERS
Department of Justice Still Holding
Von Igel on a Conspiracy
Charge.
BULLETIN
Washington, April 21.It is
believed that Ambassador Bern
storff has been trapped. The
German embassy faces the neces
sity of admitting improper ac
tivities or having the fact
proved. Papers from the office
of Von Igel are accredited to the
embassy. Von der Glotz's con
fession is another important de
velopment.
Washington, April 21A nation
wide investigation of the activity of
German agents in this country was
begun today
The German embassy made the
eighth demand for the return of pa
pers seized from Von Igel in New
York Notwithstanding the demand
for the release of Wolfe von Igel and
the return of papers seized at the
time of his arrest in the former office
here of Captain Franz von Papen, re
called German military attache*
United States Attorney Marshall re
iterated today his determination to
retain not only Von Igel, but the
documents
Has Evidence.
Although Mr. Marshall refused to
reveal the basis for his firm stand,
it was learned from other federal of
ficers that he was prepared to furnish
the state department with evidence to
prove that the lease for the Von Pa
pen offices, the point upon which the
entire controversy hinges, was drawn
in the name of Von Igel
Not An Official.
Von Igel, the United States attor
ney contends, was not a member if
Von Bernstorff's official family until
December, 1915, and he doubts
whether he can be classed as a mem
ber even after that period. The lease
for the offices, federal officers state,
was made out to Von Igel during the
time that he had no official connec
tion with the German embassy.
Mr. Marshall said he had turned
the inquiry on this point over to Capt.
Wm. B. Offley of the department of
justice, who conducted the investiga
tion which resulted in the returning
of the indictment of Captain von Pa
pen, Von Igel and three others, on
the charge of conspiring to blow up
the Welland canal.
MAY SUE IVERSON
IN LUMBER CASE
St. Paul, Minn., April 21.Action
may be brought against S. G. Iver
son, former state auditor, to recover
part of the alleged loss sustained by
the state from a rule said to have
ben adopted by him in relation to
measuring timber cut on state lands.
Attorney General L. A. Smith, at
a meeting of the state timebr board
yesterday, said if it were true that a
rule had been adopted by the former
auditor by which the state did not
get the full benefit of all the timber
cut, he believed action could be
brought to recover the difference
against the bondsmen of the auditor.

COMMERCIAL CLUB TO
DISCUSS GASOLINE
At the next meeting of the Com
mercial club the house resolution
175 by Mr Randall directing the
secretary of interior to investigate
and report on the advisability of util
izing the oil reserves of the United
States through the Rittman process
in the production of gasoline by the
bureau of mines for commercial pur
poses, will be discussed. It is be
lieved that the course suggested by
the resolution offers the most prac
tical means of breaking the strangle
hold of the oil monopoly on Amer
ican industries, and that government
suits and decrees of the courts under
the Sherman act have failed to ac
complish their objects. Commercial
clubs in several parts of the state are
passing resolutions favoring the in
vestigation.

NATIONAL 6DARD AND
MILITIA PREPARED
St. Paul, Minn., April 21.The
Minnesota national guard, consist
ing of 3,375 enlisted men and offi
cers, and the Minnesota naval militia,
with 309 officers and men, can be mo
bilized within forty-eight hours. Ad
jutant General Fred B. Wood, who Is
giving constant personal attention to
many details of the service, has per
fected all arrangements for concen
tration of the Minnesota forces at
Fort Snelling within the shortest
possible time should such a move be
necessary.
The Minnesota guard consists of
one regiment of field artillery and
three regiments of infantry.
The war strength of the guard
would more than double the existing
roster of troops. The field artillery
regiment, which now numbers 636 of
ficers and men, would total 1,500,
while infantry regiments would total
1,856 officers and men instead of the
average of approximately 900 that
now obtains.

GALE AT RED LAKE
CONTINUES ROATS
ARE DEMOLISHED
Feet High Mill is in
Banger.
Bridges Are Destroyed Minnesota
International Bridge in
Danger.
The gale at the Red Lake Indian
reservation continued today and ice
from Red lake has been washed up
on shores into piles 25 feet high.
The boat "Mud Hen," which was
confiscated by the government last
fall for introduction of liquor, has
been demolished. The boat is en
tirely covered by a pile of ice.
The boat Nomemah owned by Wil
liam Cook has also been destroyed
Chippewa Damaged.
The government boat Chippewa has
been badly damaged and may be tot
ally destroyed if the gale continues.
The sawmill is within several rods
of the ice and there is much danger
that it may be destroyed by the ice.
The ice on the lake has not all
commenced to move and it is feared
that if it does move in the present
gale there will be much damage. The
present loss will exceed $25,000.
May Mean Flood.
If the ice dams the inlet of the Red
river floods will result and much dam
age will be caused at Thief River
Falls, Crookston and other points.
It was 18 years ago Wednesday
that there was a large ice pact at
Diamond Point. Ice was blown up
on the Diamond Point shore in piles
15 and 20 feet high. Trees were up
rooted but the damage was not ser
ious.
Although the ice on Lake Bemidji
is breaking up no damage has been
caused up to this time.
Bridges Destroyed.
Floods, ice pacts and log jams have
caused $20,000 damage in Koochich
ing county. This amount represents
only the carrying away of bridges
and does not include the large num
ber of logs which have been lost
from booms, the cessation of opera
tions at various mills, the flooding
of houses and damage to other prop
erty. The flood is the worst in his
tory.
While the Rainy and Big Fork
rivers are still frozen, 'the great
amount of snow along the banks be
gan to thaw rapidly and almost in a
day the rivers were overflowed from
hillside freshets.
Flood Causes Freak.
The bridge at Scarlet which lies
between the Little Fork and Rainy
rivers was the first to go. It was a
$9,000 steel bridge of great weight
but the rushing logs and ice picked
it up, carried it clean off its foun
dations, whirled it around end for
end and sat it down some distance
down the stream, each end neatly
on the opposite bank to where it had
been Here a jam was formed and
logs and ice were backed up against
the M. & I. railway bridge at the
town of Little Fork, further up
stream. At this point the water
raised 40 feet, flooding houses and
business places.
Logs Let Loose.
The steel bridge of the M. D. & W.
railway at this point, worth about
$3,500, was destroyed.
A great damage will probably be
the loss of logs from the booms. The
booms in the Rainy river where the
logs for all companies are assembled
for sorting purposes, gave away dur
ing the week and some of the logs
have drifted far down the river and
into the Lake of the Woods.
Pioneer want ads Drlng results.
