SEVENTH DISTRICT SPIRIT.
Papers of That Section Hail Him as Candidate
Truly Representative.
One of the strong men of the
Republican party in Kentucky,
who is a leader in the mountain
section, is Judge Flem D. Samp
son, of Knox county, Circuit
Judge of the Thirty-fourth ju
dicial district, composed of Knox
Whitley and McCrcary counties.
Judge Sampson is now a candi
date for Judge of the Court of
Appeals from the Seventh appel
late district, mbjectto the action
of the Kentucky primary to be
held August 5, 1916.
The Seventh appellate district
is composed of Knox. Whitley,
Perry, Knott, Clark, Estill, Mc
Crcary, Boyd, Johnson, Martin,
Owsley, Laurel, Clay. Morgan,
Lawrence, Floyd, Lee, Mont
gomery, Powell, Menifee, Bell,
Harlan, Leslie, Breathitt, Letch
er, Magoffin, Wolf and Pike
counties.
When Judge Sampson made
the announcement of his candi
dacy the press and people of the
mountain section assured him in
the most enthusiastic manner of
their support, and he is daily
receiving letters of encourage
ment from all parts of the dis
trict. He is regarded by his
supporters as the man in this
section of the State most fitted
to wear the judicial ermine and
justly entitled to represent the
people on the Appellate bench.
He is thoroughly acquainted,
they say. with the needs of the
mountain people and the condi
tions prevailing there. He is in
accord and sympathy with them,
and tho policies which h,e advo
cates and the principles for which
he stands make him an ideal
candidate and the man above all
others the Republican party
needs to represent it as Appellate
Judge.
Judge Sampson is a man of
high character, brilliant mental

P The Harlan, Ky., papers sa
of Judge Sampson that he is no
stranger to their people, and his
splendid reputation as an official
man is well known there. Judge
Sampson was welcomed warmly
at Harlan because its citizens
recognized him as one of them
selves, n plain mountain man,
born and reared in the mountains
and imbued with all the splenaid
virtues and manly characteristics
that the mountain folks revere.
It is conceded, declare the Har
lan papers, that the Judge has
the lead for the nomination, and
cannot be overtaken.
He is a staunch Republican,
whose loyalty to his party and
his people have been tried in the
crucible of time, experience and
adversity, and proved pure gold.
His record entitles him to the
consideration of the voters of
the district, and as a citizen and
a gentleman, his character is
above reproach. He is, more
over, the only man from the
Cumberland river section asking
for this office, and never in the
history of this section have the
people had a man to represent
them on the bench of the Court
of Appeals of Kentucky. Thus
it seems that this splendid
standard-bearer of the Republi

SAMPSON STRONG

Addresses Large Crowd
of Voteis at Manches

Judge F. D. Sampson was in
Clay County Monday and Tues
day meeting the voters of that
county in the i to. -' : his can
didacy forKepu'jiicii iioiinii iion
for Judge of Kentucky Court of
Appeah.
He spoke at the Court Houe
in Manchester Monday to a large
crowd, and it is reported thai his
speech was favorably received,
and that the Judge has a very
hrge following in Clay County.
It being the first day oi the reg
ular April Term of the Clay Cir
cuit Court, a very large crowd
was in town, men were there
from all parts of. tho county,
many of whom were enthusiastic
for Sampson. There were repre
sentative citizens from adjoining
counties, including men from
Bell, Knox, Perry, Laurel and
Whitley. Among those from
Knox county were B. P. Walker,
J. M. Robsion, Noah Smith. Col.
Alex Sevier and Sol T. Steele
The boys returned e i
over the pi-";, . .
son receiving a big vote in our
sister county of Clay at the Aug
ust Primary. Scores of people
who had never met Sampson be
fore expressed themselves as be
ing for him, and the friends of
Judge Sampson there propose to
take upthe fight and see to it
that Clay County will stand bj
him with a majority vote over
any opponent now in the field.
During the past week there
have been some mighty favora
ble reports received at the Samp
son headquarters from other
parts of the Appellate District.
It looks like Sampson is going to
be a big winner in this race. The
laboring class of people, who
know Judge Sampson, know that
he is their friend. It is very
noticable, that these folks, of
whom so large a number of our
good citizenship is composed, are
for Judge Sampson in the var
ious parts of the district, and
they will ,-ote for him. The
working men are his friends and
he is their friend.
