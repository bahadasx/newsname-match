WHY SHOULD SALMON CITY
TAX SCHOOLS FOR WATER ?!
-
The disregard of civic beauty in |
Salmon is otwerved by all refined vis ]
itors. The render, pr iperties are or
namented to a high degree of art
while tt.e public grounds st.ow ne
glect of the first principle of refine
ment. A visiting lady who lias been
Interested in a noble work of lieautl
fylng city p rks and otter public
grounds, aller in'pec ling tl.e school
grounds of Salmon, said she had nev
er »een a community of our impor
tance that did not have in its midst,
at least oue artistic individual of
force enough to arouse sentiment in
favor of civic beauty.
It is a fact that our school gr- utuK
are as unsightly as sheep corrals.
They are strewn with ashes, cinders
and sand teat dance to the wind and
glare with the rcfletion of the sun
Tl.e i.aiural conditions of soil and
climate are favorable for grass, Mow
ers and shrubery. These are the tiret
requisites of refinement The child
who goes from a home where be >uti
fui trees. Mowers and lawn are re
garded as tl.e first and most impor
tant evidence of refinement to look
upon tt.e asl.es. dust, find* rs and
stones of the Salmon school grounds
for the hours of the long day bal
ances loss of refinement against the
knowledge gained
Water for irrigation is required t
produce grass, flowers and trees on
the Salmon school grounds. It is
claimed that the price demanded hy
the municipal authorities for water
for Irrigation of the public school
grounds is practically prooibltlve.
Why should there be any charge for
the use of water for this purpose?
The school grouuds are as nearly ..
municipal asset as anything could
be. and the treautv added to them by
the use of water would be wholly an
sset of the city. The pupil« and
teachers would plant tt.e trees and
lawns if the water were available
file labor of making il.ese improve
ments would be a valuable pari of ed
uoat ion.

HANDY PHONES FOR

A portable telephone tlmt weighs

The uew instrument, with a few
