VOLUME VIII.
EKALAKA, (FALLON COUNTY) MONTANA, FRIDAY, APRIL 21, 1916.
NUMBER 16
CLEAN-UP CAMPAIGN
Time limit in Ekalaka will be
up May 1st.
Have you joined the "Clean
Up and Paint-Up" movement?
If not, Ret in line and march to
the front ranks and be ready for
duty. The royal battle o f
"Clean Up and Paint Up" will be
fought all over the country.
This movement has enlisted the
aid of every one, young and old,
the schools the clubs, commercial
organizations, municipalities and
county communities.
One State wide campaign was
started by the Oregon Federation
of Women's clubs, which led to
the issuing of the proclamation
to "clean up and paint up" by
Governor. Withycombe and was
followed by the appointing of a
committee from the Portland
chamber of commerce.
This committee inaugurated a
publicity campaign of stupendous
work and met with successful co
operation on the part of ministers
and physicians through the state.
That it has received true co
operation from the physicians is
evidenced by responses.
One physician indorsed the
movement as follows: "It is much
more exhilarating and encourag
ing to see clean, well kept yards
and lawns, clean streets and
buildings than to see dirty lawns
and neglected buildings. The
first example is exhilarating; the
second is depressing. In which
state of mind do you do your best
work?"
Another physician said:
"Want to put the doctors out
of business? With good water
and a salubrious climate and an
abundance of fresh food most of
the doctors would be idle loafers.
But I am with you just the same.
I am having my house painted and
my lawn mowed, and when the
painters get their stuff out I will
Hush out the garage."
Are you going to do the same?
Take heed of the advice of. the
above physicians. It is vital that
everything be made spick and
span not only for showing oit to
the visitors that are coming to
your town this summer, but for
the sake of yourself, your family
and surroundings.
The above article appeared in
a recent issue of The New North
west, of Missoula and as the Eka
laka clean-up campaign closes on
May 1st, the final date set by the
local health officers, we thought
it mighty appropriate for the re
publication. Let those who have
failed thus far to heed the advice
of the clean-up boosters to get
busy today.
Mrs. H. H. Hedges is the latest
purchaser of a Ford car.

Bryan Stands for Wilson
Hope of enemies of the national
administration that William Jen
nings Bryan would oppose Pre
sident Wilson's renominatiou and
thus bring about a split in the
democratic party, was shattered
by Mr. Bryan in the current issue
of his newspaper, "The Common
er", which comes out squarely
for the President and predicts
that he will be renominated by
acclamation.
That there may be no mistak
ing his attitude Mr. Bryan signs
the editorial of endorsement.
Bryan's attitude has been fore
casted in a number af statements
he has made from time to time
since his resignation as Secretary
of State, but the President's pol
itical opponents have refused to
believe that he ment what he said.
If there still remains any doubt
on the question of where Bryan
stands with reference to Wilson,
the following editorial signed by
Mr. Bryan in the April Common
er, will serve to settle it:
"It is now certain that Presi
dent Wilson will he nominated
by acclamation. No other name
will be presented in the conven
tion. 1 he platform will endorse
his administration and the record
made by the democratic congress.
The differences, such as may ex
ist, between the President and
Congress, will be compromised
and the party will present a unit
ed front.
It is a remarkable record of
achievement, nothing to compare
with in in number and importance
of reforms accomplished. Where
republican leaders have been
wrong, the President and the de
mocratic congress have been
right. The republican leaders
have opposed all that has been
done in favor of lower tarriff
rates, and income tax, currency
reform and anti-trust legislation.
They have insisted on war with
Mexico and even want to enter
European war. Where the Pre
sident has conceded more than
he should to the scaredness pro- j
gram, the republican leaders have [
demanded even more, so that the 1
President is nearer to the people
than the republican leaders. Let,
every democrat get ready for the !
campaign and go to work." !

Building Silos
A few days ago T. O. Stormset
of East Fork, Montana called at
my office for some agricultural
information. We discussed a
number of problems, among
which was Mr. Stormset's ex
perience in feeding silage the
past winter.
Late last fall Mr. Stormset
called for information on silos.
After discussing various types,
he concluded the pit silo would
be the best for him at that time
as it was necessary to construct
it as quickly as possible in order
to save his corn. He immediate
ly returned home and built his
silo and filled it. The corn used
was mature but plenty of water
was added which aided in keep
ing his silo in good shape.
Here is the report Mr. Storm
set gave of his winter feeding.
I had plenty of pasture, as
grass in my section was good,
but no hay except a little for my
horses. I wintered 45 head of cows
and calves on silage and what
feed they could rustle on the
ranch. During the coldest part of
the weather, I fed a small amount
of grain and about forty pounds
of silage to the cows per day.
Every animal came through in
first class shape without any loss
where if I had gone into the win
ter without any feed as some peo
ple did, I would have lost consid
erable. It was necessary to refill
my silo, as I had some corn left
in tne field and the stock cleaned
up much better after culling it up
than when fed from the trundle.
I consider this a most profitable
investment as it saved me a good
many dollars. This year I will
enlarge my silo and build another
it necessary to provide plenty of
feed for my stock. 1 believe
there will be six or eight silos
built in my eummunity this sum
mer, as a result of my experience
with feeding silage this winter.
I cannot see how any man in the
livestock business can afford to
be without one, especially tnoso
of us who are just beginning and
do not have a very large acreage
of hay crops. We can grow plenty
of corn for silage and fodder pur
poses every year and from my
experience with siiage this win
ter, 1 am convinced of its value
as feed in combination with other
roughages that we have on the
farm."— J. C. Taylor, Custer
County Agriculturist.
C. K. Putman and R. Y. Fuqua
went to Miles City, Monday eve
ning to attend the Stockmeeting.

cal and mental condition.
