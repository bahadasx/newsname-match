United States Faces
Break With Germany
Washington, April 20.—While
the United States waits for Ger
many to reply to the note de
manding the immediate aban
donment of present methods of
conducting submarine warfare,
one of the chief sources of con
cern here is the possibility of
another attack on a peaceful
ship carrying Americans before
the Berlin government has de
termined upon its course. In
such an event it is admitted
that an immediate rupture could
be prevented only by proof that
Germany has been unable to
communicate with her subma
rine commanders.
Grave Danger Threatens in Submarine Con
troversy President Issues Practically a
Ultimatum to Berlin
Washington, April 19.—Presi
dent Wilson's long expected final
warning to Germany that the U.
S. will break ofT diplomatic rela
tions unless she abandons her pre
sent methods of submarine war
fare and immediately declares her
intention to do so, was delivered
today in a note to Berlin and also
•was announced by the president
in an address to a joint session oi'
congress.
The president considers that the
next step depends solely upon
Germany and that three or four
days constitute a reasonable time
for a reply.
Diplomatic history records but
one instance where a breaking of
relations between two first class
powers has not eventually brought
•war—that which now exists be
tween Germany and Italy.
Congress received the presi
dent's declaration of his course
•with mixed evidence of concern
and approbation. Most of the
leaders, Democrat and Republican
thought the president could hard
ly do less, and some expressed the
opinion that his action would not
lead to war.. Republican Leader
"Mann alone of all the opposition
leaders openly attacked the presi
dent for his stand. He character
ized it as a political play.
President Wilson's words leav
no opportunity for double mean
ing. In his address in congress
lie said:
"I ha'. deemed it my duty to
say to the imperial German gov
ernment Hint if it is still its pur
pose to prosecute relentless and
indiscriminate warfare the gov
ernment nf the United Stales is a*
last forced to a conclusion that
there is ^ne course it can pur
pose: and that unless the imper
ial German government should
now, immediately, declare and ef­|criminate
fect an abandonment of its p-e
sent methods of warfare against
passenger and freight carrying
"vessels, this government can have
no choice but to sever diplomatic
relations altogether,
The note to Berlin declares:
"The government of the Unite 1
States has been very patient. Tt
lias accepted the successive ex­11
planations and assurances of the
imperial government as of course
givn in entire sincerity and good
faith and has hoped even against
liope that it would prove to be
possible for the imperial govern
ment so to order and control the
acts of its naval commanders as
to square its nolicy with the rec
ognized principles of humanity
as embodied in the law of nations.
It has made every allowance for
unprecedented conditions and has
been willing to wait until the facts
became unmistakable and were
•susceptible of only one interpre
tation.
"It now owes it to a just regard
for its own rights to say to the im
perial government that that time
has come.
"It has become painfully evi
dent to it that the position which
it took at the very outset is inev
itable, namely, the use of subma
rines for the destruction of an
enemy's commerce is of necessity,
because of the very character of
the vessels employed, and the very
thods of attack which their
employment of course involves,
utterly incompatible with the
principles of humanity, the long
established and incontrovertible
rights of neturals and the sacred
immulies of non combatants.
"If it still is the purpose of the
imperial government to prosecute
relentless and indiscriminate war
fare against vessels of commerce
by the use of submarines, with
out regard to what the govern
ment of the United States must
consider the sacred and indisput
able rules of international law
:»nd the universally recognized
dictates of humanity the, govern
ment of the' United States is at
last forced to the conclusion that
there is hut one course to pursue.
"Unless the imperial govern
ment of Germany should now de
clare in effect an abandonment of
its present methods of submarine
warfare against passenger and
rreight-carrying
reels
vessels, the gov­
ernment of the United States can
have no choice but to sever dip
lomatic relations with the Ger
man empire altogether.
"This action the government of
'he United States contemplates
with the greatest reluctance, but
constrained to take in behalf
of humanity and the rights of
neutral nations."
Had the recent attack on the
'•bnnnel steamer Sussex, the note
'ells Germany, been an isolated
•ase. the United States misdit have
hoped that the submarine com
mander acted in violation of his
"overnment's solemn p'edues and
•hat the ends of justice might line
been suffered by a disavowal, rep
aration and his proper punish

the steel parts of the "war head"
of the torpedo still bear the dis
tinctive red paint common to Ger
man "war heads".
Besides this evidence, the note
contends, every circumstance
either admitted by Germay in her
disclaimer or proved by aflidav
itts of persons on the destroyed
liner proves beyond question that
she was torpedoed without warn
ing.
In short, the United Slates pres
ents the evidence as the capstonc
to an accumulation of evidence ex
lending over a period of months
which is held to prove irrefutably
that Germany's assurances to the
United Stales repeatedly have
been wantonly violated.
Copies of the American note
were sent to representatives here
of neutral nations oil the assum
ption that they are as much in
teresled as the United States in the
protection of neutral rights. The
document was not given to any of
the belligerent diplomats as the
controversy is regarded as being
solely between the United Stales
-ind Germany.
Count Von Bernslorff already
has reiterated to Secretary Lan
sing under no circumstances will
Germany give up llie submarine
is a weapon of warfare, because
she contends it is retaliation of
Great Britain's food blockade. The
ambassador has declared, howev
er, that his government will at
tempt to conduct submarine oper
ations within the laws of nations.
This the United Slates is willing
to discuss after Germany has ab
andoned her present methods
rot before.
Against the possiblity stands the
declaration in the American note
thai the United Slates has consid
ered from the start that the em
ployment of submarines for the
destruction of commerce is by its
very nature "utterly incapable
with the principles of humanity,
the long established and incon
trovertible rights of neutrals and
the sacred immunities of non
combatants."
Up to Germany.
The crisis now resolves itself
into the waiting stage during
which Germany will have oppor
tunity to accede lo the American
demands. Before another week
begins, settlement of the long
•.landing issue eillier will be as
•issured or Count Von Bernslorff
will have his passports and Am

Japan Raises Mailed Fist?
Tacoma, Wash., April 21 (5 o'clock).—Siezing upon the
psychological moment offered by this country's complica
tions with Germany and Mexico, it became known here this
afternoon that Japan has in effect issued an ultimatum to
the United States in the California alien property holder law,
stating that the refusal of Washington to have the law repeal
ed would lead to an immediate severance of diplomatic rela
tions, a step which without doubt would lead to war between
the two countries. It is a matter of common knowledge in
official circles, it is claimed, that the Carranzist government
some weeks ago sent a deputation to Japan with the view to
securing a Mexico-Japanese alliance, and that Japan, feeling
that her interests in the east are not now in common with
those of England, is quietly paving the way for an under
standing with Germany, even while at present helping Rus
sia with her. munition problems. This information is from
a quasi-official source and does not bear official authority,
but while denying full information, it is understood that the
United States, with the three problems on her hands for im
mediate attention, faces the most delicate position in years.
