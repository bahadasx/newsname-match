Hard Fight Being Mndo Hero Caul
Congressman Carter to Delay
tor Ponding Investigation In
Uio Moantlmo Early Holds On.
Tho fight for the Durant post of
fice has gotten so warm that Con
gressman Carter, who has most to
do with the making of the appoint
ment, has decided to nominate no one
until ho can investigate the -field,
and tho feelings of tho patrons more
carefully, and tho applicants havo all
hoen so advised.
Tho applicants for "the office are"
J. IT. Downing, Jim Yarbrough, Dial
Currln- and Sam Swlnnoy. Messrs.
Downing and Currln havo been keep
ing pretty quiet and doing what work
they havo dono in their own way.
Tho principal fight seems to be be
tween MesBrs. Yarbrough and Swln
ney, each of whom seems to havo a
strong line-up of endorsoments, and
one of whom has a petition bearing
tho signatures of a lot of the pcopta
of the city.
Whilo ho htiB not so advised, it is
believed that Mr. Carter will make a
qulot visit to Durant to look the field
over and endeavor to ascertain just
who tho poople really went.
The commission of C. W. Early,
tho present postmaster, will expire
the 30th of this'-month, we are told,
but ho will keep, on holding the job
until a successor has been appointed
and has qualified.
measure responsible for the Increas
ed interest being taken in good poul
try, and the high prices thoy ar6 now
commanding is also coming in for its
sharo of attention and causing many
farmers to look upon tho raising of
ftickons as something moro than a
Lphnan's Job." Just as surely as
r pays to railo good stock of .any
fklnd Is tho truth of the assertion that
it pays to raise good fowls. It cost
no moro to raise one than the othor,
after ono gets his Btart; they are a
whole lot bettor to eat, and in most
cased lay better than tho common
mongrels. Then, too, thcro is vastly
moro satisfaction, in raising a thor
oughbred 6f any specios of llvostock.
Wo tako more pride in them, and as
a consequence take hotter care of
them, and if there Is, any good qual
ity in their makeup wo are pretty apt
to bring it out.

for the purchase of tho Ardworth

son and P. C. Dings, both of Ard
more, are president and secretary
xespectlvely of the Ardworth Company.
KICKING ABOUT STREET LIGHTS
There are many poople kicking
about Durant's street lighting ser
vice, and one or two of the most ve
hement of those who kick, say that
the lights never burn at all on dark
nights, and that thoy usually do well
when the moon, is full. The city lias
a contract with the local light com
pany on this matter. The exact sta
tus of the contract wo do not know
just at this time, but as soon as ft is
-possible this .paper,, will attempt to
tell Its readers, just ''whoso fault it Is
that the streets are dark on dark
-nights.
AGITATION FOR "GREAT WHITE
WAY" FOR" DURANT
Agitation for a Great White Way
for this city Is on the Increase, and
many business folk are Interesting,
themselves in such a project. Tho
most talked of plan is to have three
ornamental standards on each side
of the street in each block, ..with
threo lamps to -the standard in the
middle and five at tho corners. The
25 Club Is now getting data on the
cost of installing and oporatlng such
a system of lights, and will possibly
attempt to handle tho matter.

President WllBon's long expected
final warning to Germany has comei
Tho President's message is Couched;
in no uncertain terms, and warns thd
Gorman Government that unless suh
marine warfare on passenger and
merchant ships is abandoned, that la
breach of diplomatic rotations must
at onco follow. Tho message Is nd
more or less than an ultimatum to
Germany, and Congress, in joint ses
sion Wednesday, to hear tho message
read before It was transmitted, al
most unanimously approved the Pres
ident course. Tho note leaves no
room for a double Interpretation, or
for any misunderstanding. Count
von Bornstorff, German Ambassador
to the United States, immediately
got In communication with Berlin
an advised that the United States is
in dead earnest nnd that something
must be done and done quickly. ,
Following are a few excerpts
from the message, which cannot pos
sibly be misunderstood:
"Tho government of the United
States has been very patient. It
now owes it, to ju3t regard for Its
own rights to say to the Imperial
dqvernmentthat the time has come-."
"tf it la still the purposo of tho
Imperial. Government to prosecute
relentless and lndlscrlmlnato warfare
against vessels of commerce by- the
uso of submarines without regard to
what tho Government of tho United
Statos must consider the sacred and
Indisputable rules of International
ihw and tho universally recognized
.dictates of humanity, the Government
Of the United States 1b at last forced
to the conclusion that there Is but
one course It can pursue.
"Unless the Imperial Government
should now Immediately declaro and
effect an abandonment of its present
methods of submarine warfare
against passenger and freight carry
ing Vessels the Government of tho
United Statos can have no choice left
but to sever diplomatic relations with
thd German Empire altogether. This
action the Government of the United
States contemplates with the great
est reluctance, but feels constrained
to take in behalf of humanity and
tho rights of neutral nations."
Evidence carefully gathered shows
beyond reasonable doubt that the
Sussex was torpedoed, In spite of tho
German declarations that it hod
struck a mine. Reports coming from
Paris yesterday say that the German
Emperor uas decorated tho com
mander of the submarine that at
tacked tho Sussex.
In tho minds of the President and
Congress thero Is only one thing on
earth that will prevent a break in
diplomatic relations between the two
governments, and that is Germany's
immediate cessation ot all submarine
warfare, except, of course, as applied
In actual operations against tho ac
tlvo war vessels of their combatants.
Should tho Germans fall or refuse,
tho break will come. However, this
does not necessarily mean war; but
in every Case in history, except one,
whore there has been a breakln the
diplomatic relations, war hasfollow
ed. Diplomatic relations between
Germany and Italy were broken onco
without war being tho result.
The situation in Washington is a
tenso one. Senators and Congress
men, as well as other officials, aro
ready for anything, and the 'attitude
has given Impetus to the army and
navy bill being consndered. The Ger
man Ambassador endeavored to von
fer with Secretary Lansing Wednes
day, supposedly to ascertain what the
United States was to do, but he was
put off.
Judge and Mrs. A. H. Ferguson
left Thursday for Arkansas, whero
they will spend ten days or two weeks
visiting relatives of Mrs. Ferguson.

A BOLD TRAINROBBER
One of, the boldest holduna in the
history ofJthe country occurred at
Cheyenne, Wyoming a few days' ago.
While the "Limited", the de luxe pas
senger train of the Union PacUlc rail
road, was leaving the yards a man ap-
of the train and ail thV point or two"
revolvers relieved the passengers of
their valuables, got off the runninir
train, and made good his escap'e. It
is presumed that he Immediately, re-
lurneu to tne city oerore news of. the
robbery had been conveyed to the of
ficials. He refused to rob the ladles, '
and presented a watch and chain to
the train stenographer whom he cp'm
pelled to tako up the lnvoluneary con-
trlbutlons. The watch and chain are
said to have-been a portion of the loot
of a formor robbery on the same road
a few weeks ago. A reward .of six
thousand five hundred dollars has
been offered f or his capture, deador
uuve. fivu muusunu oi mis amount
Is offered by the railroad and five
hundred by the State. So far the ban
dit has not been apprehended. He is
described as a young man of about
25, 6 feet tall, smooth shaven,, and
weighing about 170 pounds .
ARMY BILL PASSED "
The army bill ha3 passed the U. S.
Senate. According to its terms, reg
ulars, reserves, and other forces will
aggregate a million men. and the
standing army will consist of 250,-
000 men. Important provisions of
the bill are as follows: Appropria
tion of $15,000,000 for construction
of government plants for production
of nitrates to bo used In manufactur
ing ammunition. Provoslons for vo
cational training of enlisted men of
tho regular army, either in agricul
ture or in tho mechanical arts. Cre
ation of a National Guard section In
tho general staff of the array, and
requiring alj officers and enlisted
men of the National Guard to sub
scribe to an oath to support the Unit
ed States as well as the respective
States. Provision for Federal pay of
all National Guard officers above tho
rank of Captain. It, Is expected that
tho House will at onco ask for a con
ference to perfect the final form of
a now army measure. One feature of
the Senate bill that oven Its most ar
dent champions fear may be sacri
ficed In the loglslatlvo compromise Iff
the volunteer reserve force, but in
that event they confidently expect
that the school reserve will bo-retained
as a substitute.
