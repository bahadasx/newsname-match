The concession of the right to block
ade an enemy country, which Is uni
versally recognised, is regarded as nec
essarily carrying with it the right to
regulate the admission of goods to the
neutral country evidently destined to

over, It Is argued that an incident to the
exercise of this right of regulation of
Imports is the right to search vessels
approaching the neutral country and
that this can be done only by taking
the neutral ship to the nearest conven
ient port where the cargo may be ex
amined.

ports of the White sea and Arctic
ports, it was made known at the Rus
sian embassy today.
An Interpretation advanced In ma

to France.
It was said today that the Russian
embassy will Issue a statement as to
just what ship movements are per
mitted under the decree.
The Russian dispatches regarding
the closing of ports offer no explana
tion.
It Is assumed by the officials here
that the closure Is a purely military
measure incident to the use of the
ports for the embarkation of the heavy
Russian reinforcements going forward
to France*
The necessity of guarding the troop
transports has obliged the Russian
government to regard as enemy ves

Von jder, Goltz, Confessed German
Agent, Furnishes Government Names
of Many Teuton Sympathizers Oper
ating in United State*—Lansing to
Order Return of Igel Papers Identi
fied by Bernstorff.
Washington, April 21.—Additional
indictments of German sympathizers
in this country will be asked by the
department of justice as a result of the
revelations of Horst von der Goltz.
Von der Goltz's statement wes said to
have opened a "field practically with
out limits."
The government will follow every
olue. It was understood today the
number of men involved in von der
Goltz's activities In the United States
is much larger than had been thought
heretofore.
The pending New York indictments
against five of von der Goltz's assist
ants were said to include the leaders
In the conspiracy to blow up the Well
and canal, but indictments of men in
volved in minor ways will be sought
soon.
To Return Papers.
The state and Justice departments
today announced the government's
willingness to return to the German
embassy all the papers seized with the
arrest' of Wolfe von Igel which Count
von Bernstorff will idenitify as official.
Count von Bernstorff protested vig
orously against the taking of the pa
pers and it was said that Secretary
Lansing was considering the necessity
of an official apology. Should the am
bassador assert that the documents
were all official they would be re
turned to him hut It was said to be the
intention of the department to keep
the photographic copies.
It Is said the papers disclosed some
mattejw .whlsh" have not before come
to the government's attention. If none
of the documents tye declared official
It Is understood the United States will
use them all in -the prosecution of von
Igel and his assistants.
That Secretary Lansing would send
a note to Ambassador von Bernstorff
expressing regret "at the seizure Is
probable.
It was suggested the state depart
ment might delay aotion until the sub
marine situation assumed a definite
character.
INVOLVES MANY OTHERS.
Von Der Goltz Furnishes Names of
Conspirators New to Government.
New York, April M.—Horst von der
Goltz, the German soldier of fortune
and secret agent, whose statement of a
detailed plot to destroy the Welland
canal was made public by Great Bri
tain last night is now being detained
at Ellis Island. He was brought here
with the understanding that after he
ha3 made his statement to federal of
ficers or a grand Jury he should be re
turned to England to be detained a war
prisoner until the'war Is over.
Von der Goltz Is In the custody of the
department of Justice. Soon after ar
riving here he was taken before the
United States district attorney and. It
is said, he revealed to the official the
details of the Welland canal plot. As
a result of the Information he gave In
dictments were returned aganst Capt.
Franz von Papen, the recalled German
military attache Capt. Hans Tauscher,
who Is said to be an agent of the
Krupps Wolfe von Igel, von Papen's
former secretary. In whose office fed
eral officials seized the documents now
claimed by the Germany embassy: Al
fred A. Frltzen and Constantino D.
Covanl. There is no mention of von
Iget's name in von der Goltz's state
ment as made public In England.
The German embassy now demands
the release of von Igel on the ground
that he Is a member of the German
embassy.
Many Involved.
Many names of German propagand
ists or Germans employed In alleged
unneutral activities In von der Goltz's
statement have never figured before In
that connection.
According to his story, von der Golta
was a captain In Carranza's army in
Chihuahua in June, 1913, when he was
arrested by General 'Mercado and sen
tenced to be shot. Three times, von der
Goltz sa(d, he was Jtfaced against the
wall for a firing squad and each time
taken back to prison. Eventually he was
released on demand of the German con
sul.
He then went l« Los Angeles, where,
In November, he says, an attack was
made upon his. life. He returned to
Mexico and took part In the battles of
Torreon, OJlnaga, San Pedro and Za
cates. Just before the European war
began the German consul at Washing
ton called him to meet Captain von
Papen.
District Attorney Marshall 'later an
nounced he had been directed to for
ward the original Von Igel papers to
the state .department.
Do*« Not Reveal AM.
The revelations In the confession of
von der Gotts, as published today In
diapatche* from London, do not con

confession of von der Goltz was In
