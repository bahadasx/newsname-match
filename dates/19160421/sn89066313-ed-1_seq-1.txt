WASHINGTON, 1). C. April 2.
With news that the American mote to
(ierniany has reached Ilerlin, otlicial
eyes are turned expectantly oversea
for the events that are yet to come.
The I'nited States has spoken its
last word and, with no attempt at
disguising the gravity of the situation,
there is unlet acceptance of the fact
that the continuance of friendly rela
tions rests now wholly with the Im
perial Government.
It might be said that what hope
exists of an ultimate satisfactory set
tlement is based largely, if not alto
gether, on the known fact that Count
von llernstorff, the Herman ambassa
dor, is communicating with his gov
ernment as rapidly as delayed trans
mission will permit, and is urging, as
he lias urged since the beginning of
the controversy, that whatever con
cessions are necessary be made to pla
cate the Uniti-d States, now fully
aroused.
Count von llernstorff has won many
diplomatic triumphs since Germany
proclaimed her submarine warfare,
triumphs over his own fiovernmemt In
winning it reluctantly to at least ver
bal concessions on the Important
points at issue. He is believed to be
convinced that something more in the
same direction is now required if a
breach with the I'nited States is to be
avoided. His task is correspondingly
more difficult, while political condi
tions in (Ierniany are understood to be
such that the Imperial Government it
self, even if it desired to give full sat
isfaction in word and deed to the
I'nited States, would be hard put lo it
to find a way.
The imperial chancellor. Dr. von
Ilethmann-Hollweg, embodying the ci
vilian aspects of the federated gov
ernment, has so far held the German
emperor to a policy of documentary
concessions to the I'nited States. It
appears, however, that the military
element, which means also the naval
or submarine element, headed till re
cently by Grand Admiral von Tirpitz,
has managed to continue its marine
atrocities either with the tacti con
sent of the chancellor or in spite of his
opposition.

Judge Harris Grants Liquor

M. K. & T. OPPOSES IT
Prosecutor Maintains That
Delivery of Intoxicants
Creates a Nuisance.
Temporary injunctions, prohibiting
the railroads and express companies
from transporting, delivering or stor
ing intoxicating liipior Into or in Co
lumbia, except to licensed druggists
and pharmacists, were granted this
morning by Judge David II. Harris
in tlie Hoone County Circuit Court
The injunctions will hold until the
next term of court, June 19.
Judge Harris granted temporary
restraining orders against the rail
roads and express companies last Sat
urday. This order prohibited the
druggists and pharmacists from ob
taining intoxicating liquor eveu- for
medical use. The temporary injunc
tions granted today are the same as
the restraining orders except that they
exempt the druggists and pharmacists.
The M. K. & T. railroad was the
only one to oppose the granting of the
'njunctions. It was represented by its
chief counselor, J. W. Jamison of St.
I.ouis.
Mr. Jamison said that the M. K. & T.
Railroad did not care if all transport
ing of liquor was stopped, because
the revenue obtained from this source
was not much. He said the Katy oppos
ed the injunction in an effort to protect
itself against mandamus suits, which
in some states have forced railroads
to deliver intoxicating liquor into dry
territory. He also said that accord
ing to state law, the road had the right
to ship liquor to licensed druggists,
and to persons for their private use.
Prosecuting Attorney W. M. Din
widdle tried to show that the deliver
ing of liquor created a nuisance, any
nuisance beir.g a violation of tin- law-
lie said that there is no way of tell
ing who receives the consigned goods,
iiid that liquor brings a crowd to

Three years ago the two schools at

state meet at Columbia.
What! Students Who Won't Work I
"Every home in Columbia is busy
cleaning," said C. O. Smith, secretary
of the Y. M. C. A. Employment Bureau,
today. "We need students who want
to work, but most of them are out
of town and most of those who are
here do not want to work."
DO YOU GIVE YOUR LAWN
THE PROPER TREATMENT?
Caring for the lawn offers many
serious problems. Proper cutting and
watering are two of the most essen
tial points, ajid many lawns have been
entirely ruined by improper methods
in one or tlie other.
The grass should be cut the first
time when it is about four inches
long. For the lirst cutting it is ad
visable to use a scythe, because the
mowing machine tends to tear the
grass up before it is well started.
However, if the machine is sharp and
properly "set." it serves the purpose
well. A dull machine will pull the
young blades of grass out by the roots
and is hard on the lawn as a whole.
The grass should never be cut closer
than an inch and a half, and if it is
allowed to grow to four inches the
lower parts of the blades will become
discolored and make the lawn unsight
ly for a few days.
In the spring and fall the clippings

THE BEST ADVERTISING MEMCM
Hugh Chalmers Sajs Newspapers Are
the .Most Satisfactory.
From the Spokane Spokesman Review.
Hugh Chalmers, head of an automo
bile corporation of the same name, re
marked to the Ad Club recently that
"newspapers are the best medium of
publicity," and added that "he does
not place advertising copy with news
papers because he agrees with their
editorials, but because they have cir
culation and reach the people."
The statement of the reason for ad
vertising through the papers is a
sound statement and is well expressed.
The fact that Mr. Chalmers advertises
heavily through the press and is suc
cessful in business adds the weight
and force of experience to his views.
The newspaper has proved itself in
strenuous competition with other me
diums of publicity to form the most
effective means of reaching the public.
The intelligent advertiser uses the pa
per without the slighest regard to its
political position or editorial expres
sions upon questions of public policy.
He buys advertising space, not be
cause the paper is of this party or of
that sect, but because it has a circu
lation among purchasers of his goods.
He carries on his advertising as he
carries on other business. He invests
in advertising in a paper because it
promises good returns on his invest
ment.
(should be caught in a catcher behind
the machine, because a rake will tear
the sod. During the warm months of
the summer it is well to allow the
clippings to remain on the yard, be
cause they will form a mulch that
protects the roots.
Watering is one of the most abused
practices in connection with the care
of lawns. The common practice is to
water the lawn a little every day.
j This allows only "the upper inch or
two of the soil to become wet, and
the subsoil will become hard and dry.
The roots of the plants will seek the
moisture and will be drawn upward.
If these daily applications are neglect
ed a few times, injury will result. The
proper thing is to give the ground a
thorough soaking and then to wait
until it becomes dry, or nearly dry,
before watering again. Too much
water will cause the soil to become
sour. Grass grows poorly when the
soil is in that condition.

CHIHUAHUA. Mexico, April 21.
The body which was brought to this
city as that of the outlaw Villa Is not
the bandit leader's-. The report that
the bandit bad been killed and buried,
and his body exhumed, was branded
false by General Gutierrez.
It was also made known today that
the Carranza government on April
IS issued an order prohibiting Ameri
can army aviators from flying over
Mexican cities. Americans here told
of Carranza troops firing a volley at
an American flier Wednesday.
Food shipments for the cavalry
horses of the United States troops in
-Mexico from El Paso are being held
at Parral on the order of General
Obregon, Carranza war minister. It
is thought that the Mexican federal
troops are being centered at Parral
to prevent the United States from
making further progress into Mexico.
EXPERTS TO VISIT FARMS
Permanent Organizations Can Recehe
I'nhersity Aid This Sprintr.
Are you planning any experimental
or demonstration work on your farm
this spring to find the best and most
economical and profitable ways of
working and managing it? If so, it is
suggested that you ask the agricul
tural extension service of the Univer
sity to send a demonstrator to visit
you.
The College of Agriculture recog
nizes that example is a better teacher
than precept and has arranged for
demonstrators to visit communities
desiring to carry on demonstration
work. Only work that has passed the
experimental stage and is known to
be of practical value will be given.
The demonstrator will visit only com
munities where permanent farmers'
organizations have been formed.
A representative of the College of
Agriculture will visit the co-operator
as often as conditions demand. His
visits will be at least once a year.
and instruction will be furnished for
conducting the investigations and ex
periments. The man for whom the demonstra
tions are being given will be expected
to keep simple records of his work,
s- that a statement can be made as
to its value and efficiency, to permit a
iii"eting of neighbors on his farm and
to provide transportation for the
demonstrator between the railroad sta
tion and the farm.
