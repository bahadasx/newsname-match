8ERNST0RFF CONFERS WITH SEC, LANSING
Unofficially States That Germany May Be Willing to
.Modify Her Course but -Government Officials Want
Unequivocal Announcement From Teutons.
WASHINGTON, April 20. While
United States waits for Ger
many to reply to note demanding the
immediate abandonment of present
methods of conducting Mubmurtno
warfare, one of the chief souices of
concern here Is the poKwibllity of an
other attack on a peueeful nhip par
ryinn AnmrlcHtis hefore the IScrlln
Kovernnient has determined upon Its
course. In such an event it is ad
mitted that an immediate rupture
could be prevented only by proof that
Germany hud been un;ible to com
municate with her submarine com
mander. In explaining the demand of the
United States today officials said that
while abandonment of the present il
legal methods at once was esentiul
to continuunce of diplomatic rela
tions, the United States might agree
to German submarines operating un
der the strict restrictions of cruiser
warfare. It was emphatically reit
erated however, that a discussion of
that phase would not be entered into
until the present campaign whs
brought to a stop. The Urkited States
stands firm in Its determination not
to tolerate the unlawful and in
human, sinking of another ship.
Unci- .Must lip Saved,
Cruiser warfare, such as would be
regarded aa lem.1 by the American
government, would make Imperative
the exercisa of the right of visit and
search, the passengers und crews be
ing accorded a d"gree of safety con
sidered adequate. The mere placing
of passengers and crews In smull boats
far from land and in dangerous seas
would not meet the requirements.
The Mediterr.intan plan of warfare
as announced In tho German memo
randum on January " to the United
States has not worked satisfactorily,
administration officials consider. It is
held that in many instances subma
rine commanders operating In tho
Mediterranean have disregarded the
understanding In letter and in spirit.
Count von Kernstorff. the German am
bassador, is understood to have sug
gested to his government that it Issue
new declaration applying, to all sub
marine operations similar to that cov

Tho ambassador called at the state
department today and had a liS-mln-ute
conference with Secretary I.unslng.
Mr. Lansing listened with much inter
est to the suggestions mado by Count
von liernstnrl'f, which he understood
the ambassador was ready to make to
his own government for its guidance
in framing a reply to tho American
note. The secretary, however, was
not disposed to accept tho views ex
pressed by tho ambassador as being
official. He was described author
itatively as being Inclined to regard

A PEACE ADVOCATE
COMES TO THE FORE
Stop Fighting, Is Word
Senator Newlands Would
Send Belligerents.
WASHINGTON. April 20. Sena,
tor Newlands today introduced
resolution urging the belligerents
' to consider terms on which peace
might be made. It declares that the
declared purpose of the war the
punishment of Serbia for intriguing
against one of the Teutonic allies
has been accomplished, and that. In
the war which has resulted from a
small commencement, the Teutonic
allies have won on lund while the en
tente allies have won on sea.
The people of all the warring coun
tries, tho resolution says, want pence
and the rnge of conflict makes diplo
matic parley impossible. The ex
pressed vlows of Germany and Eng
land, the resolution declares, indicate
a harmony of view as to many things.
It then proposes that Belgium
.should be restored as a buffer state
between Germany and England; that
Poland be restored as a buffor state
between Itussla and the Teutonic em
pires; that Germany's colonies be re
stored or compensated for by a re
adjustment of the boundaries or
spheres of Influence In Europe or
Asia Minor and that Russia's access
to the Persian gulf or the Dardanel
les be secured to her. -
A gradual reduction of British na

The labor party, which was tho only

the first seven traits were also put up
und sold for a good price.
When adjournment of the sale was

present owners of leases to pay for
easing and equipment on the leases.
The total amount of dally production

RAN ANTONIO, April 20. While
Mujor-Generul Hugh L. Scott, chief
of staff, is hurrying to the border as
the personal envoy of .Secretary tf

holding his forces In Mexico in what
practically is a defensive position. No
developments of great Importance
were told of in reports received at
General Funston's headquarters and
It wus evident that tho pursuit of
Villa hud been halted. Unofficial re
ports were that Villa had made his
way south Into Duriingo, although of
ficial Mexican advices continued to
indicate that officials at the war de
partment In Mexico City yet gave
some credence to the story that the
bandit chieftain had died of his
wounds at some point south of Cusi

General Funston forwarded to the

from General Pershing on general
conditions In that part of the coun

troops have gone and on the relations
that exist betw n them and the Mex-

General Minston did not make pub
lic the facts contained In General
Pershing's report received today oth
