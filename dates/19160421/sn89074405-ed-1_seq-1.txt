to Accomplish
the Task.
Boston, Maas., April at. Seven
thousand bluejaokets at the Charles

for the purpose of making the SO
war vessels in the harbor ready tor
sea at the earliest possible hour. It
is authoritatively stated that vir
tually every ship would be at the
top notch of efficiency in IK days.
Enlisted men are being employed
'because of the difficulty In obtain
ing sufficient civilian mechanics*
Half of the 7,000 have, been re
called from furloughs and shore
leaves.
"It Is a measure of preparedness,"
It was officially explained, "the
necessity of which was Increased
by the- fact that we have been
handicapped for months by a
shortage of civilian workman and
material. If we are to make these
ships ready for the sea at an early
notice, repairs must be completed
soon and It waa found that the only
way to accomplish this was to put
the bluejackets to work."
The vessels to be overhauled in

about 5,000 officers and men, 10
torpedo-boat destroyers, three scout
cruisers, one submarine and sev

NORTHERN ROUTE
FOR DUTCH BOATS
London, April 21.—Three Dutch
steamships, Including the liner Ryn
dam, have arrived at Kirkwall. This
signifies the definite inauguration of
the northern route for Dutch shipping
which was decided upon recently.
The fact that these steamers arriv
ed simultaneously has given rise to
the belief that they were either con
voyed by Dutch warships across the
North sea, after creeping along the
Dutch coast, or were accompanied by
tugs.

FORMER AGREEMENT
IS NOT FAVORED
Understanding Between
Root arid Takahira Said
to be Repugnant.
Washington, April 21.—Viscount
Chinda, the. Japanese ambassador,
conferred with Pi-esident Wilson over
a provision at .the pending immigra
tion bill whlph proposes to enact into
law a so-callid gentleman's agreement
restrictin^ tlji immigration of Japan
ese feborenttV- A memorandum on the
subject. has -leen presented to the
state department.
Old Agreement Disliked,
The proposed inclusion in the law
of an lnfoiutial agreement which
Japan has proiAised on her honor to
fulfill, according to an agreement be
tween'foitoiei-Secretary Root antf for
mer Ambassador- Takahira is under
stood to be mpugnant to the-'Japan
ese government,
Other proposed Asiatic exclusion
features in the bill, as it has passed
the housis and was reported to the
senate, are understood to be subjects
of objection.
For many obvious reasons the atti
tude'of the administration is said to
be one of disinclination to irritate the
situation between Japan and .the. Unit
ed States which has been smouldering
slncfe the California anti-alien land
negotiations went into an Indefinite
stage three years ago this summer.
Administration officials are not un
mindful of. the anti-Asiatic sentiment
in congress, particularly among mem
bers from the Pacific coast states, and
the constant endeavor has been to
allay It.
The United- States never has replied
to Japan's last note on the California
land law. Tjhe last that was said on
the subject was skid by former Sec
retary' Bryan to Ambassador Chinda,
wheh. negotiations went Into a stage of
apparent .deadlock. The ambassador,
on taking' hls'departure from the con
ference, ait Bryan's office, inquired if
he too wis ,tiv transmit the last word
of the UnKisdLj.States to his govern

Fall of Trebizond Gives Rise

The fall of'Treibzond- has given rise fro
a fresh crop of rumors that Turkey
is approaching Russia with peace ov

ed in official circles that no such pro

Voicing a conviction that Turkey

"We may now consider one of our
enemies finished. The taking of Tre

sought ways to a separate peace, but

close no separate agreements. Tur

improbable that she will in the near
future entirely disappear from the

No longer impeded by Turkish
pressure on the coast, the Russian

Secretary Baker insisted there were no /orders or information up

war department overnight from Funston. and all information Indicat
ed that the Villa hunt practically was at a standstill. Baker said there
were no new orders or troop movements, and reports from the border
undoubtedly referred to the strengthening of Pershing's communica
tion line, an order for which previously was announced.
Pershing's Gamp, at Front. April 21.—The fight at ParraL where,
according to Indisputable evidence reaching here. Carranxa troops In
force attacked the cavalry of Major Frank Tompkins, has changed
the entire aspect of the Villa chase so far as Immediate military plans
are concerned. This attack upon the American force, which went In
good faith into Parral, In a moot friendly fashion, blocked what seem
ed to. be an excellent opportunity for either the capture of Villa or the
dispersal of one of his strongest bands.
Heretofore, American troops have reckoned only on meeting op
position from brigands, but the resistance from the regular armed
troops of the Mexican army put the American military leaders imme
diately under the necessity of preparing for serious difficulties.
Whether these preparations will have to be completed depends upon
the future course of the Carranza faction.
Within a few hours after the Parral light, a new disposition of
American troops was partly completed, and within two days its most
