"Washington, 1' r ' . April
-The
Russian embassv dispatches today re
garding the closing of the Arctic and
White sea ports offer no explanation.
It was said at the embassy that the
suspension of traffic will be complete
except In the case of vessels carrying
government cargoes and even in thut
case they can secure admission to the
ports only by special permit from Pet-
ograd.
It is assumed by the officials here
that the closure is a purely military
measure incident to the use of the porta
for embarkation for the heavy Rus
sian reinforcements going forward to
France.
The necessity of guarding the troop
transports has obliged the Russian
government to regard an enemy ves
sels all but government owned or
chartered ships and to reduce to a
minimum the danger of destroying neu

Proponed Plan Zot Satisfactory.
It ie said here unofficially that thi
Mediterranean plan of sea warfare, a
cruiser warfare, as proposed Thursday
by ambassador von Bernstorff in pro
posed settlement of the crisis would
not be quite satisfactory to the United
States, because submarine command
ers have on numerous occasions vio

torpedoing ships.
No settlement will satisfy the United
States, it is pointed out. short of an
understanding which will completely
and unequivocally meet this govern
ment's contentions
Further, the United States wants
German assurances in this connection
to come direct from the imperial gov
ernment and not from the ambassador
