Bryan Arrives In Washington
Saying He Is There For The
Purpose Of Aiding U. S. To
Keep Out Of War
(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON, April 20. Whilfl
the United States waits for Germany
to reply to the note demanding ihc
immediate abatement of present metn
ods of conducting submarine warfare,
one of the chief sources o fconcern
here is the possibility 01 another at
tack on a peaceful ship. carrying
Americans, before the Berlin govern
ment has determined upon its course
In such an event it Is admitted that
the immediate rupture could be pre
vented onlv by proof that Germany
has been unable to communicate with
hoi submarine commanders.
In exDlaining the demand of the
while abandonment of present illegal
methods at once was essential to con

tinuance of diplomatic relations, the
iTnitut ctttAa mip-ht nrree to Herman

.v.; Kr tht . derision
would not be entered into untn the
present campaign was brought tc a
Ftop. The United States stand tirni
in its determination not to tolerate the
unlawful and inhumane sinking of an
other ship. ,
Cruiser warfare, such as would be
regarded as legal by the American
government, would make imperative
the exercise of the right of visit and
search, the passengers and crew be
ing accorded a degree of safety con
sidered adequate. The mere j.lncing
of passengers and crews in small
bests, far from land and in dangerous
.seas, would not meet the require)
mtiits.
The- Mediterranean pl:?n of warfare,
as announced in the German lr.emo
nnihim, f January 7, to the United
States has not worked at satisfactor
ily as officials considered It is held
that in many instances submarine
commanders operating in the Medit
erranean lias disregarded the under
standing in letter and spirit. Count
von T-ernstorn. the German nubassa
dor. Is understood to have- suggested
to his government that it issued a new
new declaraUan applying to all subma
rine operations similar to that cover
ing the "ar.ipnign in the Medii--run-rean.
The ambassador called at the
State' department today pnd had a
twenty five ti,nutes confeience with
secretary Laming. Mr. I-ansing lis
tened with much interest to the sug
gest ion.s ti ade by von P.ernstorff,
which, h.? understood the ambassador
as readv to innke to his cwn govern
ment, for its guidance in framing a
reply to the American note.
The secretary, however, was noi
disposed to sccept the vie expiess

of the administration. The presidnt

there must be an abatement of the

tary Lansing takes the view that there
must be a direct and formal response,
from the German government itself
before there can be a discussion of
the various phases of the subiect or
of any alternative proposals, short of
an absolute compliance with the de
mpnds of the American government.
As a result of his conference, von
Bernstorff sent-another communica
tion to his government this evening. It
was made clear at the German embas

had made a formal reply to the

Just how long the United States is
willing to wait for the German reply

Present Crisis Than At Any
Time Since it Was Formed
(By Review Leased Wire.)
LONDON, April 20. The whole
nation was surprised and the great
majority of the people were cheered
by the unexpected announcement to
the cabinet meeting this morning that
the cabinet deadlock over the ques-
Ition of extending military conscrtp
tion had been compromised. Thus the
country is saved from the anvious
days it would have sullered until
parliament reassembles on Tuesday
and from the newspaper controversy
which would have raged meantime.
The labor party which was the oniy
political group united against lurlher
measures of compulsion is credited
t"h paving the way to the agreement.
' The leader of the labor party, Arthur
Henderson, president of the bosrd ot
I education proposed, according to the
reports', a further trial of voluutary
'enlistments, with the promise lhat the
! laboiiiUs would consent to a gradual
extension of conscription if it proved
necessary to secure the nimiVr of
men which military authorities con
sider essential. The labor members i
together with others demanded that
they be informed on the exact posi
tion what number of men had al
ready been enrolled and pledged:
how many the war office requires to
enlarge the army and replace the
wasting casualties and other causes.
Consequently a secret session of both
houses will be convened Tuesday at
which the government will supply full
in formation.
