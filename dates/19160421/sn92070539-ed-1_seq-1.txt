pleasantly surprized tit tl e pro
gross Columbus lias made since

Lieutenant Elkin L. Franklin,
of the Thirteenth Cavalry , was
promoted to tho rank of Fust
Lieutenant on the Jiltli instant.
Deputy Sheriff T. A. Ilulsey
arrested a man hero Wednesday
who was receiving mail and tele
phone calls under thu name of
Harry Brown. Investigations
sliowed that lie was under an
assumed name and Unit he was
wanted on charges of forgery.
Mr. and Mrs. B. E. Sisco,

The seven Mexicans who were
captured hero during the raid i
were tried in Doming Wedno.s- j
day. They were all undor the i
same indictment and it took loss
than one day to present the evi- j
donee. The jury was out thirty
minutes and gave a verdict of
irlllttv llf niltl-fW 111 till. ( I I'M I
degree as charged in the Indict-!
mont. Tho only thing now that
can save their nucks is interfer
ence by the governor, which is
not at all likely.
S evoral more prisoners among
whom is Ttinda Sanford, will
probably face the same charges
as Mils unlucky seven at the
next term of court. Young Sail
ford was captured at the front
.several days ago and is now be
ing hold in the camp guard house.
Houses Should Be Numbered
Now while Columbus is grow
ing so rapidly it would bo a good
idea to number tho houses. Of I
course it would not be of any
assistance to those who have
lived here any great length of
time in locating any business or
rosldonso houses for all know
where they are all located, but
now there is hundreds of strang
ers in and around town anil they
very often put to no small
amount of trouble in finding
places. It has been suggested
by visitors to our city, and sev
eral property owners wuo have
visited Columbus for tho tlist
uuie dm ing thu past weelt have
grumbled because they we;e un
able to locate their holdings.
Tho names of the. streets ought
lo bo placed ut every corner and
thun it will bo any easy matter
for strangers to locate the placos
ihuy wisli to. There is a num
ber of new business houses un
der course of constructiuu and
I rum present indications the
growth of Columbus will be
rapid.
Tho work of numbering the
buildings will have to be done
sometime and it will be less ex
pense to the city now than to
wait until later. If the dads
will take the matter up and give
the property owners their num
bers that they may put them up
the job can be done with but
little expense to anyone.
