SOME NEW
ROAD CHANCES
Idea is to Do Away with Ex
pensive Hill Roads and A
dopt Easy Grades—Shorten
Road to Greencreek.
One of the greatest movements
for the benefit of the residents
of this community that has been
inaugurated in years was
launched recently when the mat
ter of constructing two new
pieces of highway to take the
place of some of the most diffi
cult and expensive roads in this
district was taken up and is now
in a fair way to be carried
through to a successful comple
tion. The first change contem
plated, and which will ultimately
result in an entire new road built
lies northeast of town. This pro
posed road is projected to start
from a point in the present street
on the north side of the Aichl
mayr addition, pass in a north
easterly direction through the
Wiest place, a corner of the
Lauer farm, thence on the east
side of the draw through the
Jenny farm, passing directly
through the barnyard of Mr.
Jenny, thence down Stock creek
through the Adehm farm, thence
on the south side of the creek
through the Goeckner and Eckert
farms, thence for a distance
through the John Arnzen farm
and swinging north on the line
between the John F. Nuxoll and
Joseph Riener farms, inter
sect the present county road
at the corner south of the Henry
Schmidt place.
This road, if constructed, will
shorten the distance between
Greencreek and Cottonwood by
fully two miles and will provide
a grade of not to exceed five per
cent at any point on the new road
and most of the distance will not
exceed two per cent. It will han
dle most of the traffic originating
in the Greencreek and Winona
sections and will do away with
several miles of very difficult
road work 'that otherwise will
have to be kept up at very heavy
expense each year. Most of the
right-of-way for this proposed
change has already been secured
and it is believed the rest will
fall in line when made to see the
benefits to be obtained by the
change.

The second change under con
templation is through the Schni
der farm east of town and will
result in an extension of the pre
sent road from near the slaugh
ter house east to the west line of
the Kopczynski farm and thence
northeasterly to a connection
with the present road at the Ter
haar place. Another branch
would swing south to connect
with the present road at the Huff
corner. This change would also
do away with two or three bad
hills, reduce the grade materially
and shorten distance to some ex
tent.
If the changes go through as
outlined they will result in the
abandoning of several pieces of
little used roadway, which will
replace in part the ground given
as right-of-way for the new roads
and will mean a great saving in
expense to the highway district
in time to come as well as to the
farmer who hauls heavy loads to
the warehouses and railway.
These changes did not origi
nate with the highway board but
were anvanced by residents of
the district, many of whom are
strongly in favor of the proposed
changes, and subscription lists
are now being circulated to raise
funds to pay for the new right
of-way and other expenses to be
incurred in making the change
and are meeting with generous
support. Many farmers of the
country south and east of Green
creek and in the Greencreek and
Winona sections are contributing
to the fund and it is quite prob
able the roads can be built with
out the highway district expend
ing much more on them than
would otherwise be spent this
year on improving the present
roads.
The proposed changes have
not as yet been brought to the
official notice of the highway
board but will be presented at
the next meeting, when, if it is
3een that the sentiment of the
public is generally in favor of the
changes being made, the matter
will no doubt be taken up offici
ally and pushed to an early com
pletion.
Such changes as those advo
cated are of vital importance to
the residents of this district and
should not be passed over lightly
Such changes are bound to come
in time anyway and there is little
to be gained in trying for years
to build good roads over hills and
then later abandon this work and
construct them along easy grade
lines where they should have
been placed at the start.
Move Flour Mill to Railroad
Felix Martzen returned Satur
day evening from Lewiston
where he closed a deal for the
purchase of a tract of ground
near the local depot from the
Camas Prairie railway company
for the site for the new flour mill
to be erected there during the
coming summer by the Cotton
wood Milling company. While
it will be several weeks before
the deed for the ground can be
received from the head office of
the company at St. Paul the work
of reorganizing the company and
increasing the capital stock is
going steadily forward and sev
eral subscriptions of $1000 each
have been received during the
past week. The moving of the
mill to the railroad and the erect
ing of a new mill building with
increased capacity has been un
der contemplation for the past
couple of years, but it was only
within the past few months that
satisfactory arrangements could
be made with the railroad for a
suitable site for the mill. The new
site acquired is located on the
north side of the track just west
of the depot and opposite the
Vollmer-Clearwater warehouse
and it is expected that work on
the new mili building will be
started during the early summer
and that the machinery can be
moved and the mill be ready for
operation shortly after harvest.

U. S. May Break
With Germany
Washington, April 19. President Wilson's long-expected final
warning to Germany that the United States will break off diplomatic
relations unless she abandons her present methods of submarine war
fare and immediately declares her intention to do so, was delivered
to-day in a note to Berlin and also was announced by the president in
in an address to a joint session of Congress.
The president considers that the next step depends solely upon
Germany and that three or four days constitute a reasonable time for
a reply.
Diplomatic history records but one instance where a breaking of
relations between two first-class powers has not eventually brought
war—that which now exists between Germany and Italy.-Associated
Dispatch.
Mew Teachers Chosen
The board of trustees of the lo
cal public school held a meeting
Monday evening and selected the
following corps of teachers for
the coming school year: J. P.
Barackman, superintendent;
Wm. A. Lusty, principal high
school; Miss Sloneker, teacher of
domestic science; Miss El va Gray,
7th and 8th grades; Miss Fannie
McGrew, 5th and 6th grades;
Miss Janette Wood, 3rd and 4th
grades; Miss Ora M. Lowe, pri
mary department.
Prof. Barackman has been em
ployed in the schools of Latah
county for the past sixteen years
and comes very highly recom
mended. He has taught in one
of the Moscow city schools for
the past five years and was prin
cipal of the Kendrick school for
eleven years continuously before
that time. Prof. Lusty comes
from Seattle and has taught for
a number of years in the schools
of Washington. Miss Lowe will
come here from Binford, N. D.,
her selection having been made
by the board under the impres
sion that Mrs. Fryer intended
leaving during vacation and
would not return.
The above new faces, with the
four old members of the teaching
staff, should give us one of .the
best corps of teachers in this
part of the state and we hope
will result in the successful oper
ation and advancement of the
educational standard of the school
until it ranks with the best of its
kind in the state.
Farmers Union Build
New Flour Mili
Cottonwood is to have another
flour mill. This decision was
reached at a special meeting of
the board of directors of the
Farmeas Union Warehouse com
pany in this city yesterday and
notice of the decision is officially
given elsewhere in this issue.
The mill to be erected will be
built adjoining the elevator and
warehouse in the west end of
town and work will be inaugu
rated as soon as details of the
plans and organization can be
completed. The mill will be of
not less than 50 and perhaps of
100 barrels daily capacity and
will be completed in time to
handle a large portion of this
year's crop. It will be operated
in conjunction with the elevator
and will be in charge of a com
petent miller, the ultimate aim of
the company being to grind into
flour a large part of the grain
grown by the farmers of this
section.
Notice
We have received a liberal sup
ply of seed corn from the O.-W.
R. & N. and parties who re
quested us to reserve some for
them can now secure it by calling
at our office. Requests so far
received bring the total corn
acreage up to 212 acres. We
will be glad to reserve some for
you while the supply lasts.
Yours truly,

Eller Captures Insane Man
Deputy Sheriff Will Eller had
rather an exciting experience
with an insane man last week
across Salmon river but finally
captured his man and took him
to Grangeville after they had in
dulged in a miniature reproduc
tion of a battle on the French
frontier. The officer was sent
for by residents of the Joseph
country to round up James Evans
an insane man who had been
breaking into and robbing cabins
in that part of the county. After
following the man for three days
the officer got within hailing dis
tance of him one morning and
called on him to surrender.
Evans replied with a shot from
his rifle and, and as there was no
cover handy, Eller had nothing
left him but to draw his gun and
go after his man. Evans con
tinued to shoot arH Eller replied
with his revolver until a bullet
from the latter weapon passed
close enough to Evans' body to
t he skin, when he signified
lis willingness to submit to ar
rest. Evans had three guns and
several knives and a quantity of
ammunition in his possession and
as Deputy Eller was armed only
with a revolver he was taking
desperate chances in trying to
capture the man. Evans had
been in the asylum before and
escaped but will no doubt be
closely confined in the future, as
he is a dangerous man to have at
large.
Deputy Sheriff Eller was for
merly a resident of Cottonwood
for many years and his friends
here are proud of the fine record
he is making in the discharge of
duty in office.
Build New Electric Plant
B. L. Sivyer, son of the treas
urer of the Grangeville Electric
Light and Power company, is in
the city from Spokane looking
over the local field and incident
ally placing on scale some of the
treasury stock of the company in
this section. Mr. Sivyer states
that his company intends con
structing a big electric plant at
some point on the Clearwater
during the coming summer in or
der to take care of the increas
ing demand for electric lights
and power in the central Idaho
section and to make their systém
as efficient as possible and insure
an uninterrupted service at all
times, regardless of weather con
ditions or other possible troubles.
As has been the rule of the com
pany in the past, the money
needed for these improvements
will be raised from the sale of
treasury stock and the company
desires to place this stock with
its patrons in the various towns
served by its lines as far as pos
sible. The company guarantees
eight per cent interest on the in
vestment and will sell shares on
the easy payment plan. Those
interested can secure full infor
mation by calling on the local
agent.

Good Roads Pointers
Fill up the low places. The
hills will drain of their own ac
cord, and water always seeks the
low spots.
Get good, deep ditches estab
lished nearest the hill on all
grades and the storm waters will
not bother the center of the road.
Don't let a bad mud hole de
velop in the road in front of your
farm. It's a bad advertisement
for you as a progressive farmer.
A few good roads on easy
grades and well kept up are
worth vastly more than a large
number of poor roads which can
not be given proper attention.
Don't try to work the roads
and your farm at the same time.
One is sure to be neglected. Do
what you think is most necessary
and leave the other job to some
other fellow.
Always provide a way for the
water to drain away from the road
Pools standing on either side of
road are certain to soak up the
soil and will ruin even a hard sur
face road in time.
Keep the black dirt on top of
the road whenever possible, even
though it has to be hauled, sever
al hundred feet. It makes the
best road and will pay for the ex
tra labor in a single year.
Don't leave low spots in the
road on both sides of a bridge or
culvert. If you do, half the time
the culvert will be high and dry
while the low spots will be mud
holes during the wet season.
Don't think because your neigh
bor may have a car that good
roads are only for his pleasure
and benefit. They will save you
money in rigs and horse flesh
every time you have to pass over
them.
Clay cannot be made into good
wet weather roads without a good
gravel coating on top, and as
gravel is hard to get in this coun
try it will be found advisable to
do as little clay road building as
possible.
And last, but not least, DRAG
THE ROADS AFTER EVERY
STORM. Your horses and hired
men are doing nothing then for
half a day at least, and dragging
is what counts in building and
maintaining good roads in a dirt
country.
What Dairying
Means to Wisconsin
The state of Wisconsin has 1,
626,000 cows and the annual pro
duction of dairy goods is $100,
000,000, placing Wisconsin in the
front rank in dairy prodnets says
an eastern paper. There are
only six states in the Union that
havd more than 1,000,000 cows
each. The state of New York
stands next to* Wisconsin with
about 1,500,000 cows. Of the
other states which take high rank
three of them border closely on
Wisconsin. They are Illinois,
Iowa and Minnesota, while Texas
is a range cow state rather than
a dairy region.
Wisconsin also has over 500
creameries, while Idaho has only
seven. When it is considered
that the first pure bred Holstein
male was introduced in Jefferson
county, the center of the dairy
section of Wisconsin, in 1875 and
the first Guernsey male in 1885,
it can be seen that it has taken
only about half of an ayerage
lifetime to build up the dairy in
dustry in that state from nothing
to its present high standard.
Let Idaho become interested in
dairying and within a few years
it may become one of the leading
industries of our state.
