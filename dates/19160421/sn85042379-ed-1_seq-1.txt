GLASGOW, VALLEY COUNTY, MONTANA, APRIL 21, 1916.
NUMBER £.1 „
SITE SELECTED
FOR FLOUR MILL
Work Will Commence on Build
ings Immediately.
300 BARRELS PER DAY
Machinery Has Been Purchased and
Contract for Buildings Will be
Let Next Week.
As soon as material can be gotten
on the ground, work will be started (
on Glasgow's new 300 barrel flour
mill.
Mr. Dunnell, of the Minot Milling
Co., was in the city yesterday and
after looking over the sites, decided
that the north half of block 10 would
make an ideal location for the mill.
This site is located in the west end of
the city, facing the railroad tracks.
The Board of Directors of the Com
mercial Club met last night .and made
the final arrangements to procure the
site for the mill, and Mr. Dunnell
stated that the contract for the erec
tion of the buildings would be let the
first of the week. Work on the
structures will commence as soon as
the necessary material arrives here.
The mill will be of 300 barrel daily
„ „„„ ,
capacity, instead of 200 barre s, as,
first deeded on by Mr. Dunnell, and
the construction work will be rushed
to have it completed as speedily as
possible.
The matter of trackage has been
taken up with the Great Northern and i
they expressed the desire that the
mill be located in the west end of the
yards to conform wijh plans they
arte p>)ing \to make in the switch
trackage.
These plans comprise the
laying of a new industrial track and
the enlarging of the storage tracks
in the west end of the yards.
The machinery for the mill was or
dered last week when Mr. Dunnell
was in Minneapolis and plans for the
building are now being prepared. The
buildings will consist of the mill, a
large warehouse for the storage of
flour and an elevator with a capacity
of 40,000 bushels.
HAVRE TO CELEBRATE
The Great Northern Montana
Stampede will be held in Havre, July
3rd to 7th. George Francis, Jack
Mabee and Harry Stevens, who have
won fame with the laria't are con
templating putting on the big show
and they have the experience, equip
ment and the broad acquaintance over
the west among the living ropers and
artists in this particular line to as
sure its success. The total amount
for prizes to be awarded is $4,765.
It is figured the total expenditures
will be $19,300 which is the actual

such as Pendleton Oregon's annu:il
roundup. ..
The affair will be i un night and day
under natural gas illumination. The
half mile track will be lighted by
gar. so that the night events c«n 'ne

INDIANS MUST WORK
Poor Lo, the Indian will not have
the easy time this spring that he has
iad in former years on the Fort Peck
reservation. Colonel C. B. Lohnui
ler, superintendent of the reservation
lias issued an order to all able bodies
male adult Indians calling attention
to the fact that there shall be no
more loafing »Found the agency or
sub-agency quarters and towns on thé
reservation. Those who are equip
ped to do farming will do so at once.
No more hard luck stories are desir
ed as all those who desire employment
are requested to see Colonel Lohmiller
who has made arrangements with the
Great Northern railway to employ
300 able bodied men at $1.75 per day
or 17% cents per hour.
Farmers have been instructed to
see all able bodied male adult Indians
and ascertain if they want work, and
if not, why not; making a list of all
those declining to work. And yet,
they say the Indian has an easy time.

Company G, the local organization of
the National Guard will be able to

FARMER DROWNED
Howard Sharp, a prosperous farm
er of Sheridan county lost his life
last week when the buggy he was
driving upset in Cottonwood creek.
With a party of friends, Sharp was
on the way to a neighbors to spend
the day. On reaching Cottonwood
creek, about 25 miles east of Froid,
they discovered that the water had
reached an unusual high mark and
being doubtful as to the safety of
crossing, they decided to leave the
women folks on the bank. Sharp and
another man started across with" the
intention of finding out just how deep
the water was, and if it would be safe
for the balance of the party to cross.
A sudden drop-off in the middle of
he stream increased the depth of the
water and the swift current overturn
ed the buggy. Sharp being unable to
swim was caught in the under-current
and was drowned. The other occu
pant of the buggy managed to reach
shore safely.

HIGH WATER AT SCOBEY
The Poplar river leached, the high
est mark last week that has bfvn
known for the past nineteen years,
says the Scobey Sentinel. At points
near the city it is said to have been
a mile and a quarter wide and it was
utterly impossible to cross at any
point except in a boat. Considerable
damage has been done to the bridges
and the high water carried one of
them away. The only accident re
ported was that of a young lady en
route to Scobey who lost her trunk
and two suit cases when the box
of the wagon they were in floated

COLONEL LIKES SPOKANE
Colonel E. D. Coleman of Glasgow,
Mont., who is in Spokane with Mrs.
Coleman on their twenty-fifth annual
visit, believes this city offers the best
opportunity to be found in' the west
for investors. He and Mrs. Coleman
have just returned from California,
through which they motored on a trip
made to investigate investment op
portunities.
Colonel Coleman is prominent in
Montana politics, having been leader
of the democratic party in the north
eastern section for 28 years.—Spo

BASEBALL TEAM
STARTS WORK
Much Good Material Out Sun
day Afternoon. #
FIRST GAME ON MAY 14th
Prospects Bright- for Championship
Team. Regular Practice
Begun.
Stiff backs and sore arms were com
plained of this week by numerous
doughty athletes who responded tc
Manager Fred Fischl's call for the
first baseball practice of the season
Sunday afternoon.
While there was nothing strenuous
about the first workout, yet the men
who turned out jumped into the work
with a vim and every one showed real
class. From those who were at the
park Sunday afternoon, Manager
Fischl will be able to select a baseball
team that will be a credit to Glasgow
and uphold the baseball supremacy
of the city for another year.
The team will have about three
weeks of practice before the first
game of the season, on May 14th, and
every player will be in tip top shape
when the "umps" calls "play ball."
Several new faces were seen among
those who were out Sunday and two
of them will probably be given berths
with the Regulars. Thomas, a sec
ond baseman, is practically assured
of being a fixture at the keystone
sack and Wright, an outfielder prov
ed himself a classy gardner and a
good sticker.
The probable lineup for the first
game with Nashua has been arranged
by the manager:
Grace or Wright, left field.
Hocking or J. Kelly, right field.
Bretzke, center field.
Hurly, catcher.
Benson, pitcher.
Herstrom, first base.
Thomas, second base.
Chouinard, short stop.
Bardill, third base.
"Scoop", Official Scorer.
SURVEY SHOWS SURPRISES
After making a survey of the dis
trict along the Missouri river to lo
cate the scene of the Secrest murder,
County Surveyor J. W. Richardson of
Malta and Deputy Surveyor Floyd
Smith of Blaine county found that the
murder was committed in Blaine coun
ty, as the Kipp house is a mile and
a half over the line. Moreover, they
found that Secrest's home is also in
this county, although it was supposed
at the time that it was surely in Phil
lips county.
Another surprising discovery was
that the power plant for the Phillips
mills in the Little Rockies is a thous
and feet across the line in Blaine
county, and therefore subject to tax
ation in that county.
Another peculiar fact established
in connection with the survey is that
the county of Blaine still takes in half
of the Missouri river from the Blaine
county east boundary to the Valley
county line. Ir the creation of the
county of Blaine its territory was
described by boundaries that ran ta
the middle of the Missouri river chan
nel. When Phillips county was creat
ed its boundaries, were describe i as
mnivng only Ho the north bank of
the .Missouri river. Such a situation
might lead«to some ather puzzling en
tanglement*.
INQUIRIES ABOUT CLAY
The news item in the Courier about
the Kaolinite clay which Albert Nel
son found in commercial quantities
near the city, has brought about a
number of inquiries, and eastern par
ties are now contemplating making
a visit to Glasgow to inspect the pro
perty with a view to put it to com
mercial uses, if it can be done.
TWO MORE PAPERS
FOR PLENTYWOOD
Plentywood, the county seat of
Sheridan county now has two news
papers, the Sheridan County News
and the Plentywood Herald. Advic
es from reliable sources give the in
formation that two other papers are
to be started there as soon as the
equipment can arrive from the east.
It is stated as a fact that George
Cook, formerly editor of the Sheridan
County News, and until a short time
ago, undersheriff under Duggan,
would again venture into the turbu
lent sea of journalism. The other
paper will be under the editorial guid
ance of George Weather head, who
now pilots the Antelope Independent.
With four papers to give them the
live néws of the day, the people of
Plentywood should soon be the best
posted of any in Sheridan county.
MASON TAKES PARTNER
The question "What's in a name?"
has been asked many times. When
Orval E. Mason started his insurance
office in the old log building, north
of the Shannon Hotel, he thought
there would be no more suitable name
for it than the "Log House." By
judicious advertising, he has made
the Log House Insurance Agency
known all over the county and his
business has grown by leaps and
bounds.
A half interest in the business was
nurchased this week by William G.
Curry who has a farm west of the
Badger School house on the north
bench and who formerly was in the
real estate and insurance business in
Kansas City.
The offices are being completely re
modeled and a large sign has been
painted with the name of the firm in
bold letters, which will stand in front
of the building.
Besides handling all kinds of real
estate and relinquishments, they will
do locating and handle insurance in
all its branches.

dent Alderson and the executive com
mittee.

sideration by the Chamber of Com
merce of th« Gateway City, through

ments are now being made to have
the three associations gather at some

in Livingston wil be definitely fixed
within a few days, and in this respect
the wishes of the Host City will be

been determined whether the meeting
in Livingston, when the association's
business will be transacted and the
visitors .entertained by the. Livingston
Chamber of Commerce, followed by
the annual banquet, shall be hçld be
fore or following the trip te thé Parie,

' resigned to take charge of the edit
'o.rial department ol' the Helena Rec
ord. Mr. Skinner l'as acted as &ssi?1
