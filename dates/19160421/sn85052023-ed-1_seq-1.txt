NAME COMMISSION
BEFORE ELECTION
Js Suggestion of Many Taxpayers to
Fiscal Court Road Bond Ques
tion Arousing Interest
Quite a lot of interest and dis
cussion is being aroused over the
proposed bond issue of $200,000 to
be voted on May 13th in Lincoln
county. The proposals of the Fiscal
Court as outlined in a circular is
sued, containing the resolutions of
the court have attracted a lot of
attention, and interest. The action
of the Fiscal Court is set forth in
this issue in full so that all may be
made cognizant of what the court
proposes to do in the event the
bonds are voted.
The suggestion of the court that a
commission will be named to advise
and assist the court in handling the
fund realized in the 'cent the ronds
are voted is meeting with much fa
vor. V6ters and taxpayers, however,
with whom the I. J. has talkod, in
sist that the Fiscal Court should
make public the names of the men
in each magisterial district who will
be appointed o.i this commission, l e
fore the road bond election is held
The proposal, so it is understood, is
to appoint two weil known and re
sponsible business men or farmers
and taxpayers in each magisterial
district, one a republican and the
other a democrat so that politics
shall not enter into the matter in any
way, which is as it should be. An I.
J. representative was at' Crab Or
chard this week, and heard tne
Mumps of but tWO
men suggested
-fnr thp commission rrom the Crab
OrMinrH magisterial district, both of
whom have the entire confidence of
the community. Ihese names were
W. E. Perkins, the well known mer
chant, of Crab Orchard, who is a.
democrat, and Henry Cummins, a
well known farmer of the Preach
ersville section, who is a republican.
With these two men on the commis
sion and other like them from other
sections of the county, on the com
mission, every taxpayer would feel
that no better selections could be
made to compose a board to spend
the bond issue money.
That the greatest care and all
safeguards possible will have to be
thrown about tne immense sum
which is sought to be voted, is made
manifest by the experience of the
other counties which have voted
road bonds. In a very illuminating
article on the subject last week, the
Louisville Times had the following
to sav about the road bond question
in Bell county, where $250,000 was
first voted, and now another bond
.issue is asked for to complete the
"vork begun.-The. Timessaid:
Bell county was one of the first
in Kentucky to vote a bond issue for
roads after the enactment of the
State aid law. The amount of bonds
voted was $250,000. The County
Judge, who had led the fight for the
bond issue, undertook the building
of the roads. Under his direction, a
large sum was expended in the pur
chase of road machinery. The selec
tion of the quarries from which stone
was to be taken was made by him.
It is nowhere charged that he has
benn animated by any other desire
than to give Bell county the best
system of roads possible. He is a
man of remarkable energy and pro
nounced decision of character. There
is no hint of graft. But "neverthe
less and notwithstanding," Bell
county is confronted by the necessi
ty of voting an additional $15).u'Ju
of bonds if the work done and the.
money already spent are not to rep
resent a . practically total loss.
According to ths Pinnacle News,
"approximately $200,000 of the road
fund has been spent and between
two and five miles of road has- been
finished."
From the Middlesboro Three
States it is to be inferred that the
people of Bell county have been 'eft
somewhat in the dark as to the way
in which their money has been spent:
It is said: "We will admit too
much publicity in some cases is not
the best when in big business finan
cial problems are in the course of
being worked out, but when the
public money is being used, we be
lieve it is necessary that the public
be informed in detail. We have urg
ed these facts upon Judge Asher.
"This was our advice to him sev
eral months back, when it was ap
parent that a new bond issue was
necessary before the present roads
mapped out could be completed.
When you are spending the people's
money, they want to be informed on
these matters, and we now urg that
if Judge Asher wants to get right
before the people to give them a de
tailed statement backed with logical
suggestions as to why we need the
bond issue. It is all right in a busi
ness deal to go and consult a few dis
tinguished private citizens, but when
we are spending the money of all
the people it is nothing but right that
DANGERS OF DRAFT.
Drafts feel best when we are hot
and perspiring, just when they are
most dangerous and the result is
Neuralgia, Stiff Neck, Sore Muscles
or sometimes an attack of Rheuma
tism. In such cases apply Sloan's
Liniment. It stimulates circulation
to the sore and painful part. The
blood flows freely and in a short
time the stiffness and pain leaves.
Those suffering from Neuralgia or
Neuralgic Headache will find one or
two applications of Sloan's Liniment
will give grateful relief. The agon
izing pain gives way to a tingling
sensation of comfort and warmth and
quiet rest and sleep. is possible. Good
iior Teuritis too. Price 25c at your
Druggist.
all the people be consulted enlighten
ed upon these matters."
The situation again emphasizes
the absolute necessity in every
county that votes bonds of having
a commission to handle the money
and of employing a competent road
engineer to direct the work of con
struction. In three of the counties, indict
ments have been returned against
county officials for misuse of the
road funds.
In the case of Judge Asher, no
such accusation has been brought
or, we are confident, can be brought.
If he has made mistakes, they were
honest mistakes. If he erred, is has
been in trying to give Bell county
a system of roads without calling to
his aid expert advice and co-operation.
The moral to be drawn is plain.
Road building is not a matter that
can be left solely in the hands"of
County Judges and Fiscal Courts,
however, honest. The more money
voted for roads, the more impera
tive the necessity of making road
building an undertaking not left to
the chance that county officials mav
be both honest and efficient. Thi
county that is willing to vote bonds
to get roads is" running an extreme
and needless risk if it fails at the
same time to provide the requisite
machinery to make assured the in
telligent, not less than honest, ex
penditures on roads of the money so
realized.
The counties of Kentucky have
already voted more than $6,000
000. of road bonds. That sum if
rightly expended, is sufficient in it
self to complete one-fourth the en
tire county seat, state-wide system
of roads at an average cost of $4,
000 a mile. But, unless the counties
exercise a more efficient supervis
ion than has been the case here-
tofore, Kentucky will have neither
roads nor money to show for her
pains. Louisville Times.

TOUGH PROPOSITION TODAY
High School Team Plays Centre Col
lege Nine Beat Mt. Vernon.
The Stanford High School base
ball team is working mighty hard to
keep its record clean this season, by
defeating the' strong Centre College
nine here this afternoon. Of course,
the local lads are." up against a tough
proposition. A large crowd is out,
as much interest has been aroused
among the fans by the string of vic
tories which Stanford's team has
chalked up. Mt. Vernon was the
latest victim, its nine, being beaten
for the" second time when it played
a return game here Wednesday. The
score was 15 to 6 in favor of Stan
ford. The costly misplays of the vis
itors, the batting of Sam Embry, Jr.,
and the work' of the visitors' twirler
were the outstanding features of the
game. Embry, who did not go into
the game until the 6th, had a perfect
day at the bat, singling his first time
up and slamming out a ,home-run
each of his other trips to the plate.
Payne, on the mottnd for the moun
taineers, played all of the game for
the visitors with the exception of
some nice work by "Steamboat Bill"
Thompson. Payne got the poorest
sort of support behind the bat. how
ever, and from most of the fielders.
He is raid to have played in the
South Atlantic League, and up un
til the 6th ha'd held Stanford to four
scattered hits. Bill Reinhart twirl
ed a nice game for Stanford and was
ably caught by young Spoonamore.
The work of Perkins, Shanks and Joe
Embry also was very fine. The

pictures of the trains and of some of
the boosters, and distributed copies
of his paper to members' of the par
ty. He had also printed for members
of the party cards containing the
names and business interests of the
principal dealers of the town.
When the special rolled into the
station, a crowd of several hun
dred was on hand to greet, the
speakers. The high and grammar
schools had suspended for the visit
of the Knoxville party, and tho
school chilren fell into procession
just behind the band, whilt, members
of the reception committee paired
with members of the trade party
and escorted them to the courthouse
It had been planned to hold the
meeting in the court room, but it
was nothiner like larere enouorh to
hold the crowd, so the speaking was
done from the steps of the large
and handsome Lincoln county court
house
Members of the party were wel
comed to -Stanford by K. S. Alcorn,
an attorney, in a few brief but well
chosen words, who invited them to
"help themselves to anything they
saw they wished for."
He then presented Judge Lindsay,
who announced the arrangements
for the exercises at Stanford. The.
program had been arranged for the
business men. of the town to meet
in groups with the business men of
the trade trip party, and they divid
ed off into, groups, according to
their various lines .of business, and
talked business while the remainder
of the large crowd was addressed
by Dr. Stuart. The doctor talked es
pecially to the school children, and
his speech madesuch a hit with his
audience that wnen a voice in the
audience asked that if the party
would not all stay, that they at
least leave Dr. Stuart, the crowd
made it unanimous. But Judge Lind
say replied that Knoxville could not
get along without Dr. Stuart. The
doctor caught the crowd by several
stories, and got a big laugh when he
told them that the business men of
the partv were not speakers but men
of business and of deeds, and that
they carried him for the same rea
son that "a woman keeps a canary
bird, for its, good looks and its voice.

fthey had finished their course in the
btanford schools to come down to
Knoxville and enter the university,
Where they would be turned out
trained men and women for the bat
tle of life.
The reception at Stanford was the
best of the trip with the single ex
ception of that Monday at Berea,
which any town will have to hump
to beat. The crowd was large, the
reception was cordial and everybody
was in fine spirit. The procession,
was the longest of the series, by rea
son of the several hundred school
children and members of the town
reception committee who fell in with
the boosters.
Short Stop at Crab Orchard.
Only a short stop was made at
Crab Orchard. There was quite a
crowd at the station to meet the par
ty, but considerable time had been
lost earlier in the day, and the Crab
Orchard stay was made brief in or
der to try to make back some of the
lost time. Anyway, only a brief stop
had been scheduled for the place,
and Colonel Hu M. Tate made the
only talk, telling the crowd that had
gathered that on account of the
briefer stop it had been decided to
make, no program would be entered
into. He expressed the regret of the
party that the stay had to be cut
short, extended greetings from
Knoxville and Tennessee to the Ken
tuckians, and closed as the conduct
or signaled the "go ahead" and the
crowd scrambled for the already
moving train.
Another short stop was made at
Brodhead. Here, too, the school had
been dismissed and upwards of a
hundred children and several score
of adults had lined up at the depot
to greet the party.
Crab Orchard.
On Friday evening, April 14,
1916, the spirit of Leon Deborde
passed from earth to the God who
gave it. We know this announce
ment will fall with deepest gloom
upon many absent friends of Babe,
as we all loved to call him. For
about sixty days he suffered the
most agonizing pain, and was not
free from it for one moment until
his release bv death. Everything
that could be done by an able phy
sician, Dr. Edmiston and a loving
and devoted family and friends, was
of no avail. It was ou"r solemn pleas
ure to visit him' often and to us he
expressed himself freely. As we
talked to him of his so'ul's condition,
he said he was trusting in Jesus and
a few days later, when our pastor,
Rev. Wyatt, of the Christian church
went to see him he made a full and
free confession, expressing an earn
est desire to get well so as to finish
the work by being baptized into the
Baptist faith. There was no young
man in the county that had more
friends than Babe. He had a smile
arid kind word for everyone and no
(financially distressed ever an-
pealed t& him for assistance ip vain
una many remain wno were depend
ent upon his generosity and loyalty.
The sisters. Bettie and Sallie and
brothers, John, George and Henry,
were with him to the very last, and
are inconsolable, in their intense
grief. This has always been such a
devoted family and since their mo
ther's death, eight years ago the two
girls took their mother's plac-3 with
Babe, ministering to his evry want
with loving self-sacrifice, giving up
society and everything to be near
him in his delicate condition as he
was a suiterer irom asthma irom
birth. They have this to console
them that they never ne-'k'cted him
one moment when in need cf care,
and they have fulfilled their mission
just as their mother would have
done. To his dear sister, Mayme Ste
wart, who resides in California and
could not be present, our deepest
sympathy is extended. Mr. McClary
gave a beautiful and impressive
talk assisted by Rev. Wyatt of the
Christian church. Many beautiful
flowers covered the handsome cas
ket and such a peaceful restful ex
pression was upon his face. One of
the largest crowds ever gathered at
a funeral, was present.
Mr. Evans, the field .secretary of
the Christian Endeavor society, was
here last week to visit our Endeavor.
He seemed well pleased with the
work being done here and praised
the president, Miss Myrtle Murray,
and vice president, Miss Mayme
Holman, on their efficient work. He
gave them ideas about their endeav

song by the following little ones

efforts of the little ones very highly.

ULTIMATUM TO GERMANY.
President Wilson told Congress
assembled in joint session at one
o'clock Wednesday afternoon, he
has given Germany irrevocable no
tification that the United States will
break off diplomatic relations, if her
illegal submarine campaign is con-'
tinued. A note, America's last word,
practically an ultimatum and demand
ing an immediate reply, presumably
was in the Berlin Foreign Office as
the President was speaking. The Pres
ident asked no action whatever to
Congress. He simply informed it of
the accumulation of facts proving
that Germany's assurances to the
Unted States are being violated ; that
the submarine campaign, despite the
earnest protests of the United btates
is being conducted with renewed vig
or in contravention of all the laws of
nations and humanity, and that he
means to sever relations unless it is
brought within the law. Diplomatic
history of the world shows that such
a course is almost certain to be fol
lowed by war. The President's note
and his address to Congress are final.
They mark the end of diplomatic ex
changes. A continuance of the long
standing friendly relations, the Pres
ident made clear, depends alone upon
Germany's conduct.
