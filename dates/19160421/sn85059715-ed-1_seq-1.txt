EI, PASO. Tex.. April 21?With
Che troops marking time, awaiting
the decison of Washington, which
will either withdraw them from Mex- |
lco or send them forward re-enforced
at their request, there has been a|
decided Increase in the nervousness
wnich Has existed on the border I
since the expedition crossed the International
line. Both American and j
Mexican army officers and officials i
feel that the uncertainty has caused
a dellcato situation but there has not
been the slightest Indication In Juai^
oz that the Mexicans In that town had
changed their attitude of restraint.
'Movements of American troops from
points along the border to the army
base at Columbus, N. M.. vhero they
will be held In readiness to rc-cnforco
General Forcing's army In caoo of
necessity, continued Friday. Dcspaiches
from tho front Indicated that
American troops woro awaiting developments
at Washington before making
further eft'ert to capture Villa.
Officials of tho defccto government
said there was no basis tor the report!
that uprisings were Imminent In northern
Durnngo and lower Chihuahua. It
was explained at Juarez that the movements
of the Carrau.za troops Into the
Parral district were not Intended as
threats to bar the further advnnco of
tho American forces but that tho dofacto
soldiers had been cent there 10 I

destruction of private property.

pale! Friday that the work of the
American expedition was concluded
and he hoped that in a few days tha
order would cono from Washington
lor the troops to be withdrawn.
"Wo havo tho altuntlon In hand."
said Mr. Garcia. "Thq Villa cause
Is broken and if Villa ottll lives his
prestige Is destroyed."
Mr. Garcia said the government on
the llrst-of next month will domnnd
that all export and Import duties ho
paid In gold. Tho Mexican consul
did not credit, the report that the
law demanding gold for such duties
would create trouble.

This fis Concensus of Opinion of
Charleston Visitors from AH
Parts of the State.
CHARLESTON, April 21.?So far as
the choice of the Republican nominee
for governor Is concerned, the dlo has
been cast, according to reports reaching
Charleston from every section of ,
the state and through every conceivable
channel. It Is the consensus of
opinion that Judge Ira E. (Robinson, of
Taylor county, will head the Republican
ticket, and it Is conceded everywhere
that his nomination will be the
equivalent to election.
The people have had more than two
inonthB to compare the relative merits
and demerits of the two gubernatorial
candidates and there Is no doubt as to
the choice they will make. Public
sentiment has become settled and most
of the people will'go to the polls on
June 6 to vote the same convictions
they have today. That means that
Judge Robinson will poll approximately
three-fourths of the Republican
vote of West Virginia, which does not
include the large number of Socialists
and Democrats, who laying party
affiliation aside for the moment, will
go Into the voting booth to cast their
ballot for the distinguished Jurist from
Taylor county because-they recognize
him as the man of the hour In West
Virginia politics. Pew men ever havfc
had the hold on the hearts, or the
position. In esteem and- confidence of
the people that Judge Robinson. has.
His manifold qualifications are universally
known and appreciated. His
record Is his greatest asset. It speaks <
for him In terms that carry conviction.
No man knowing Judge Robinson
and whd is familiar with his career
could consistently oppose him.
The grip he has on the affection and
confidence of the people of all walks of
life Is Illustrated by the remarks over- i
heard In the various hotel lobbies of i
the city. ' ; 1
A well known Republican who vis- 1
Its Charleston frequently, sitting In <
the lobby of the Kanawha hotel last
night told of an episode that was slg- 1
nlflcant On account of his personal '
friendship for Mr. idlly. Judge Rob- '
inson's opponent, he would not con- 1
sent to have his name used. He said: 4
"It beats all how universal the de- '

Cecil Collins, an employee of the
