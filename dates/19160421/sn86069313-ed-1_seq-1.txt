MAKING NEW CAR.
Dual-Power Automobile a Great
Invention.
What'Ms by tar the most radical
and interesting ,deyelopementrecently
the May Popular Mechanics Magazine'
In designing the machine an attempt
has been made to embody the best
features of both the gasoline and
electric cars. The result is a truly"
remarkable vehicle which ' has the
body lines and general appearance
ot an electric, the speed and touring.
radius of a gas car, the comforts of
both, and the drawbacks of neither.
The car is capable of unusual per
formances. It can be driven on ga
soline power alone, electric alone, or
both at the same time.A maximum
speed of about 35 .miles an
attainable. When drl-i!?s
h'our Is
on gaso-
needed to carry the machine at de-
-
Ired speed, is saved, for the motor
automatically becomes a generator
and charges the batteries. Should

time the batteries are good for 30
miles. When a steep hill Is to be-
climbed a driver has the advantage
of two forms of motive power. Th
danger of stalling the car Is entirely
the motor would Instantly begin
turning' lt over at several hundred
revolutions a minute. Thus lt "Would
not be stalled for as mch as a sec-
ond, if in good condition, and In any
event the motor would keep the car
moving. "
From an economic standpoint the
machlno is unusual. Road tests have
shown that lt Is possible to get 45
miles out of one gallon ot gasoline.
For a car of the size and weight of
this one, the record nt first thought
seems incredltablel While driving
oh tho.engine alone about 30 mllea
is possible with a gallon of fuel.
While doing this, however, the bat-
terles are charged for an additional
16 miles. It will be s,een that the,
trouble and expenso of battery charg-
Ing, present In all electric cars, are
absent here, j
The weight of the machine Is 3,100
Ihs. as against 4,200 lb. of the electric
of which it is an outgrowth. Slnco
the battery space is lessened by half,
room Is available at tne rear to con-
jceal an extra tire. The only way in
which the car differs ln appearance
from the conventional brougham Is
that the hood has a streamline effect
and a neat, V-shaped radiator Is pro-
vlded'at the front, It should b
understood that there la no trans

otherwise would be wasted. This
distinguishes the car irom those
known as gasollne-electrlca.
