Narrow Skirts Cut Business, But
the "Balloons" Overlap
the Supply.
Paris, April 20'.-For years the
cloth manufacturers of {France have
been crying ruin owing to the vogue
of the narrow and split skirt. Now
that. women have jumped to the op
posite extreme and wear dresses that
measure oeveral yards around, the
samo manufacturers declare that
tilings have gone from bid to worse.
In ordinary time*, tho cloth rann.
ufacturera would be rubbing their
bando with glee at the change of fash
ion; aa it is they greet it with ill
concealed apprehension,.
"Our best min s are in the hands
of the enemy.' explained M. Alfred
Damez, secretary of one of the big
Traders' Committees, "and those that
are left to us are so hard at work on
army orders that they have little, tithe
to devote to their5" ordinary- trade.
Thia simply means that if .women will
insist in walking about tn skirts kt?
big na baloons, French factories will
be unable to keep peace with the dc
marni." ; '

whether the "union sareec." which
