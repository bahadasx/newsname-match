BIRTH OF A NATION.
The infamous play of Thomas
Dixon's, known as "The Birth of a
Nation," is billed to play here at a
local theater, notwithstanding the
many protests that have been made
against it coming here. We hope
that our new council will not allow it
to show in our city. Law has been
produced and argument made fully
sufficient to warrant the play to be
prohibited, so council do your plain
honest duty.
WAR IN MEXICO.
Our president has ordered the U.
S. army to go into Mexico on a puni
tive expedition only to seek, kill or
take Villa, one of the Mexican rebel
bandits, who has been fighting the
present ruler of Mexico. The United
States is seeking vengeance on Villa
to punish him because he came across
the Mexican border line into the U.
S. and killed a few of the innocent
citizens of a Texas town, and be
cause of that act he has ordered
the U. S. soldiers to capture or kill
him. We do not object to the punish
ment of Villa for killing innocent
American citizens, but why don't
President Wilson order the U. S. sol
diers to capture or kill those men in
the south that lynch, murder and burn
innocent colored citizens of Texas?
Why not deal fair and treat all citi
zens al'ke? Why stick the colored
soldiers in jim crow cars in the south
but when it comes to fighting call for
the famous Ninth and Tenth cavalry
to go first in the hunt for Villa? It
was indeed a funny episode that Ma
jor Tompkins got into at the city of
Parrall. There the Mexicans shot at
them and the Americans ran for eight
miles until they came to the colored
soldiers under Major Young (col
ored). When in trouble you need the
colored man and call for him. When
in peace you hate, jim crow and kill
him. It is not right to think that he
will always be satisfied in his coun
try under this unjust and unpatriotic
condition.

GEORGE E. BRAMMER FOR
COUNTY ATTORNEY.
It is with great pleasure that The
Bystander informs its many readers
that George E. Brammer has an
nounced his candidacy for county at
torney on the republican ticket
Mr. Brammer is a member of the
law firm of Brammer, Lehman &
Seevers in the Fleming building and
is a capable and successful attorney.
He is well known to the voters of this
county, having been elected state rep
resentative to the Iowa legislature
two years ago by a handsome major
ity. In the legislature Mr. Brammer
treated the labor organizations with
fairness and justice. His attitude on
all matters affecting the colored peo
ple was fair and friendly. It would
take too much space to enumerate
all of Mr. Brammer's acts showing
his friendly attitude toward his col
ored constituents. Probably his moat
conspicuous service for the benefit of
the whole race was his zealous sup
port of the,bill to appropriate $5,000
for the Semi-Centennial Exposition.
He introduced this, bill and after it
was reported on adversely by the
committee secured the adoption of
the minority report by the house.
The amount of the ^appropriation was
reduced to $3,000 and he championed
the bill on the floor of the house and
secured its passage by a large ma
jority. The bill then went to the sen
ate, where it died.
The colored people of Polk county
now have an opportunity to show
their appreciation of Mr. Brammer's
efforts for the good of our race. He
will make a splendid county attorney
and merits and should receive unani
mous support from our people. Wo
made no mistake when we elected
him state representative and we will
make no mistake by electing him
county attorney.
HALLADAY FOR REPRESENTA
TIVE.
We take great pleasure in present
ing to our many readers the cut of
Hon. A. B. Halladay, attorney at law,
who is a candidate for representative
from Polk county, subject to the re
publican primaries in June. Mr.
Halladay was born on a farm in Illi
nois in the year of 1870, He attend
ed the common and public schools,
graduating from the high school, and
afterward worked his way through
college, taking the business, teachers,
scientific, classic, civil engineer and
oratory courses, and for a number of
years thereafter was principal and
superintendent of schools. His last
position in the line of school work
being that of city superintendent.
From that position he returned to
college and took a two-year law
course, graduating in the year of
1900 with the degree of LL. B. from
the Northern Illinois Law school. The
same year he came here and entered
the Drake university law department
for post graduate work under C. C.
Cole, dean. He was admitted in 1901
to practice in this state and has been
practicing in our city ever since. Al
though a life long republican and for
many years an active worker in the
party, he has never held or sought
office. He has been chairman of a
number of republican clubs and
served on the county central commit
tee for a number of years, and is at
present chairman of the county cen
tral committee and is well known
throughout the county and state as
an attorney and a prominent republi
can worker, and for fifteen years last
past there has not been a republican
state or Polk county officeholder
elected but what has been in some
way
01*
1
another substantially aided
or assisted by Mr. Halladay, and hi3
friends now fe$l that he is entitled to
hearty support for the office he now
seeks. His father was an old soldier
in the civil war, and young Halladay
having come up through the common
walks of life, making his way
through school by hard work and
without financial assistance, knows
the struggles of a young man and
can fully sympathize with common
humanity. He will give all classes
and races equal justice if elected. He
is an active worker in many lodges
and societies. Fully qualified by vir
tue of his age and experience he
would indeed make an excellent rep
resentative from Polk county.

present to the colored voters of tho

NEIMAN FOR STATE REPRESEN
TATIVE.
Carl H. Neiman, of the law firm of
Neiman & Neiman, whose picture ap
pears above, is one of the candidates
for state representative from Polk
county, whom The Bystander consid
ers particularly well fitted for the
position.
Mr. Neiman was born in Tipton,
Iowa, in 1887 and came to De3
Moines when a small boy, receiving
his entire education in this city first
being educated in the public schools,

later taking the liberal arts course at
Drake university and finally gradu
ating from the law department of the
nuiversity in 1912. He was admit
ted to practice in the same year and
has been practicing in our city ever
since. 1 While in the university he
was a very active leader in all lines
of university activity. He represent
ed Drake in several triangular debat
ing contests with other colleges in
Iowa. In all of which he gave a good
account of himself.
He is a man of high ideals, and is
in thorough sympathy with the great
masses of common people in all their
contests with capital.
He hss never asked or held an
elective office before, although he is
a native of Iowa.
We feel that Mr. Neiman will be
progressive and standpat elements
together in Iowa and is the logical
man to unite all the elements of the
grand old republican party together
in one solid phalanx. His position on
the preparedness question is reason
able and right, on the temperance
question his is right, on the tariff
question his ideas are good. He is
the logical man that the republicans
can nominate this year. We recom
mend him to the people of the United
States as a splendidly equipped man
for president.
of great use to the republican party
in the future and we are in sympathy
with the movement of the present
day to send younger men to the leg
islature. So all of his many friends
are soliciting your support in his be
half, as one of the two members who
are to represent Polk county in the
lower house of the state legislature
next year.
