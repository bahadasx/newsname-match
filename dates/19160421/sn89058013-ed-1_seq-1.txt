PELLAGRA
PREVENTION
DIET
RECOMMENDED
. A faulty or restricted diet at this
, season of the year is the chief fac
vtor in the production of pellagra.,
Measures to prevent the develop
ment of the disease should be in
stituted daring the early spring
, mouths, accordiug to a circular of
information issued recently by tile
, United States Public Health Ser
vice, While the manifestations of
pellagra are in most cases not in
, evidence until June or July, the
i, oondition iuvariably dates from a
. faulty diet - ot earlier .months.'
fx ' Therefore,, if, due precautions are
, . exercised -by ; individuals at the
y present timethe havoc wrought by
V o this scourge may be greatly lessen
, , d, if not entirely eliminated.
" v. The report further calls attention
' . . to certain danger signals which
i " should be recognized by those who
- N . - ' reside in pellagrous districts or
' ' those. who have had previous at-
, ' , tacks of the.disease.. ' Among such
.warning t' symptoms are extreme
i nervousness or change in the man-
"-. . tal characteristics of the individual.
; Weakness or debility, a disinclina-
. " ' t tion to undertake the ordinary
, daijy tasks, and unexplained diges-
,. tive symptoms may all be premonf
kory signs. These 'symptoms do
" not. of course, necessarily mean
the development of pellagra, but
taken in connection with the his
tory of a one-sided', monotonous
diet, they serve as a definite warn
l log of the possibilities-of its onset..
. The diet -recommended by the
' health service for the prevention
- . of pellagra will not produce results
. , , if followed for a week or ten days
only, but is continuously and con-
, sistently used, under circumstances
similar to its administration in the
. various Institutions where the ex.
TtAt-imantnl tpstf. have been ner.
. . formed ,r it will protect the' indiyi-
quai againsir, ine ueveiopmensoi
t v the "disease. V Necessarily, a rigid
" unvaried diet is wholly undesirable
and the menu recommended is only
to indicate in a general way the
, character of the food to be pre
scribed. Frequently the.-element
. of poverty;' inaccessibility, to mar
' " kefc 8uppliesr or even .idiosyncrasy
,. . " way require sbme modification of
I the diet table,.ao that strict adher
ence to its components may not in
, I ' all respects be practicable. The
. 'object of the diet as submitted is to
Minimize .the consumption of the
i ' ''.. , carbo-hydrate (Starchy and sweet)
' , foods and to- increase the amount
; of fresh animal protein and of fresh
. - : ..legumes (peas and beans.) .
n' ; .-Breakfast, for example,, should
. V consist of oatmeal and cream; with-
1 ' iMit sugar,, with either breakfast
k bacon or bani aud x two eggs.; Not
-V wore thantwo thin slices of whole
wheat bread should be taken, pre
ferablvuntoasted. Hot bread or
J biscuits, are iuadvieable. ' A gfass
1 1 f fresh hi ilk is to accompany ths
breakfast and either oranges or
&rape fruit may be theinitial
course. The dinner should consist
of pither pea or bean soup, prepay
- ' d from dried peas or beans, wath
i meat stocky . The meat may be
beef, pork, hamv chiokeu, veal or
mutton, prepared in whatever man
v V er ia,the most appetiaing, prefer
' : v . nee being given o roasting or
. broiling rather thau frying. Ham-
. t Imrger steak, meat hash or fish may
' be substituted to afford variety.
Care should be exercised that the
meats are not overdone, Of vege
tables, Irish potatoes,. boUed- in the
jacket or. baked, cabbageturnip or
mustardgreens, collards and let
tuce are to be recommended. For
dessert, s'tewed, fresh or dried fruity
will prove sufficient. The dinuer
should be accompanied by not more
than two thin slices ot whole wheat
bread and a glass of buttermilk
The supper- should consist of pork
and beansj or'baked beans properly
seasoned, the usual amount of bread
aud a glass fif buttermilk. If pre
ferred, eggs, scrambled or , other
wise prepared, may be substituted
for the more substantial ingredient
of the meal. -, " . ., -;
A diet such as the above is not
prohibitive fas to cOstr at least to
but few of the residents of the
country, affords a sufficient umber'
of heat units, if taken in-reasonable
quantity, and- will effectually pre
vent the development of a disease
which alone caused 8,000 deaths in
the United States during the past
year;- , . :r-" , .',-v
