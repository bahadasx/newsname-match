,' j at his mercy this afternoon, nndtho wth
.' ;"i 1 alettes won their llrst Btima of the season,
". i. the final' score being1 3 to 1.
. '' The Ited Spx made only four hit's off
, . Myers delivery and vould have been shut

to the plate In the ninth .limine., Larry
t took no chances, however, playing the'
' runner'golnB to first for a sureout and
permlttlm; Iloulltzell to score.
Three of theJRed Sox htls were made In
' tho last two Innings, when Myers began
i to lose control. lie got himself In the hole
' , "with several batters and was compelled
to cut his "stuff" ,to get the ball over.
, It was one of the prettiest exhibitions
" of pitching given by a young pitcher In
. ths city In a long tlnie, and' the fans dis
played .more enthusiasm than ever since
.. , Mack' broke up bis famous machine.
' In the first seven Innings, qnly one hit
. was made off Myers and but few hard
' chances were afforded the fielders. When
It was necessary for a Mackman to pull
off, a great play to spoil a base hit the
player responded In great style.
The general work of the Athletics wad
i . such that even the pessimists who came
. out to Jeer were cheering before the last
' man had been retired. The Mackmen did
not took like a ball team which had been
beaten six straight games. Even before
they had gotten a commanding lead the
Athletics displayed more pepper and ag-
greealveness than the world's champions.
The Mackmen came out of their batting
v slump, which caused the loss of four
Bplendldly pitched games In Boston and
Jfsw York.
The deliveries of. Pennock and Jonea
s were whaled to all parts of the field, and
only a combination of brilliant fielding and
bad breaks prevented the Athletics from
V J rolling up a larger score,
fc t Lajoie and Strunk were the star club-
bers, each "getting three hits, -but Rimer
W 'Myers' double and single were responsible
' , for two of the runs.

in Game Between Boston
and Brooklyn
BOSTON, Mass., April 21. In the first
Inning of today's gams, between the
Braves and Brooklyn Ivan Olsen, of the
. Superbas, and "flabbltt', Maranvllle; of
the Braves, we're put' out' of the game by
Umpire Cy Rlgler for Indulging In a flst
fight. The engagement was short and
sweet and honors were even.
With Brooklyn' ahead, 3 to 0, Maran
vllle had reached .third base In the Braves'
half of the opening inning. Collins was at
bat and hit to Mowrey, after whose throw
to the plate Maranvllle rushed back to
third, Olson backed Mowrey up and
handled McCarthy's return throw, The
Itabblt went back hard, bowling Olsen
qyer and apparently trying to knock the
ball out of his hand. While on the ground
Olsen hammered at MaranVllle's shins
wth the ball and then Rabbit let loose
a -hard right-hand punch. This landed
squarely, and then Olson came back with
a swing at Maranvllte's head, which did
not quite reach home.
At this iuncdure. Umnlre Itiirler. who
had run down toward third on the play,
grabbed Olson around the neck and
yanked him away, while, several players
grabbed Maranvllle, who -struggled to-get
lose. Jphnny Evera- ran -out from the
Bostoivbench, but kept outiof the rumpus.
