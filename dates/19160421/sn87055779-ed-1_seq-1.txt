Wilson was asked today by Viscount
Sutemi Chinda, the Japanese ambas
sador, to have the phraseology of
the Humett immigration bill, now
before the senate Immigration com
mittee, changed so that the appar
ent coupling of the Japanese people
with those of Hindoo nationality
would be eliminated. The ambassa
dor had talked the matter over with
Sec'y Irnsing and, at the request of
the latter, asked the president today
to take the matter up with Sen.

of the committee. The president is
expected to ask that the bill be
(handed to carry the latis'uaKe
agreed upon in this connection two
years auo when a similar proposi

It is under.toil that the Japanese
ambassador called the president's

The Germans were also active

to capture a few trenches near the
houauiiiniit pond. The French made
their answer to this attack under

mans from the positions which they
had captured.
There is combined rejoicing1 today
In France over the gains at Verdun
and the arrival of Russian soldiers
to tight on the vvest-rn front. There
had been considerable impatience
over Gen. .Toffre's failure to strike
back at the Germans, hut he was ap
parently awaiting the moment when
the fury of the Teutons' offensive
should weaken. This seems to have
come. The French troops .ic ord

careful to keep from running into

I the middle of last December, and
another is located in Ann Arhor,

"The South Rend city administra

of safety, and the police department,
do not want Quilhot arrested and
brought back there." is the opinion
of one party who has been close to
Quilhot- previous to his indictment
for a number of years. "If

serted. "Quilhot might tell some
things that would not be altogether
complimentary to the administra
