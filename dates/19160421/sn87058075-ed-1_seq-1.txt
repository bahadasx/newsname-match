Never Mind—We'll Take It Out
The suit isn't spoiled. It's just damaged. Damages
can be repaired We'll repair them so that the closest
scrutiny won't show it.
And after we have taken out the stain and and all the
other soil that daily wear puts into a garment, we will
press it so carefully and thoroughly that it will look exact
ly like a new suit. The sleeve will be faultlessly ironed.
The trousers perfectly creased, and the lapels carefully
rolled.
You will put it on and feel like a new man.
Phone 441. We call for and deliver.

PLUCK, PROGRESS, PERSEVERANCE AND PATRIOTISM IN POLITICS
Deputy Sheriff Killed at New Hampton
Early Friday morning, a burglar
blew a safe in a lumber yard office at
New Hampton, securing only about $10
in cash. In a round-up of suspicious
characters, the sheriff was informed
that a man was in the woods just east
of town, and he sent his son with dep
uty sheriff Frank A. Herzog and the
party giving the information to arrest
the fellow. Upon arrival at the place,
all three walked toward the thief who
was setting beside a big tree. When
within about 20 feet of the man Herzog
ordered him to hold up his hands. The
thief leaped behind the tree and fired
three shots at Herzog, the first strik
ing him in the hip and ranging upward
into the abdomen, producing an inter
nal hemorrhage which caused death on
Sunday morning.
Herzog's companions, being unarm
ed, fled and summoned the sheriff who
summoned aid and followed the thief
who had left the woods and struck off
tcwards town, finally hiding behind a
rock pile near the greenhouse. Many
shots were exchanged, the murderer
prooably realizing that capture or death
was inevitable, turned his own gun on
himself and blew out his own brains.
No name could be found on him but a
pawn ticket fpund on him led to the in
formation that it was issued at Terre
Haute, Ind., Feb. 21st to C. K. Jones
of Effingham, 111.
The funeral of the little boy will be
held on Saturday morning at 9:30 at
the Church of the Assumption.
Besides the loss of Mattie, Mr. and
Mrs. Lydon were called upon but a few
months ago to part with another little
boy and in their bereavement the fam
ily have the sincere sympathy of the
community.
The barn was badly splintered and a
six-year old Percheron Stallion was
killed.
The same bolt which caused the dis
aster at the Lydon home followed the
telephone wire into the W. B. Perry
home badly shocking his daughter
Bessie who had been called to the
phone by her father just previous to
the storm, the bolt being the first one
of the storm. At noon the following
day she had no use of the arm, but will
doubtless gradually recover from the
shock.

When a small girl she removed with
her parents to Baraboo, Wisconsin, liv
ing at home until removing to Athol,
S. D., where, in her twentieth year, on
Sept. 26, 1884, she was united in
marriage to John E. Graf, of Athol,
and three years later they moved to
Cresco, Iowa, where the family has
since resided, with the exception of one
and one half years spent at Algona,
Iowa.
When a young girl she united with
the Methodist church at Baraboo, Wis
consin, remaining in that church until
1905 when she united with the Baptist
church of Cresco, Iowa, of which she
continued a faithful member until the
last.
Mrs. Graf was pre-eminently a home
maker, feeling that the welfare of her
family should be her principal interest,
and she remained steadfast to this ideal
throughout ber life. To the church of
her choice she was known as a devoted
and faithful member, and always,
except within the last few years when
physically unable at times to attend
services, she was constant in attend
ance and faithful in in tew(fet, her
friends, neighbors and tll8 coinim&ity
at largo .she was known as ever ready
to extend sympathy when needed, and
to be eager to rejoice with others in
their good fortune,.
Four sons and one daughter, Charles,
Bert, Earl, Frank and Leone, together
with a devoted husband are left to
regret her absence, there are also left
two brothers, Frank Bentley, of Bara
boo, Wisconsin, and Ernest Bentley, of
Ahleman, Wisconsin, and one sister,
Carrie Lamberton, of North Yakima,
Washington. All the relatives except
the latter, who was prevented by dis
tance from attending, were present At
the last services.
The immediate family deeply regret
the separation, but find comfort in the
memory of a loving wife and mother,
and are consoled by the thought that
the separation is but temporary and
that the reunion is but briefly deferred.
