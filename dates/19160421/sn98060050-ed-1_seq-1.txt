CLAPP & JONES'S
GOOD PUBLICITY FOR VERMONT,
A revised edition of the booklet
Vermont Fnrnis has just been issued
by tlio Vermont bureau of publicity, it
having been prepared largely by Will
tor II. Crockett, who is engaged in fur.
thcring the interests of Vermont
through this agency. The new volumo
is devoted to the vnrious phases 0
farm life in Vermont nnd, while ncccs
sarily brief in order to command the
attention desired, it sets forth the ad
vantages of agricultural life in the
Green Mountain state in so nttrnctlv
manner that much good is bound to re
stilt from the effort. It is, of course,
truthful and accurate to the last de
grec, because Vermont has no desire:
and feels no necessity, to attract peo
pie to Vermont under false pretenses.
and the figures included may be de
lended upon to set forth the real con
ditions. For instance, it shows in
tabulations that Vermont leads the
country in ratio of dairy cows to popu
lation, first in per capita value of spec
ified dairy products sold by farmers in
1909, first in pounds of butter per cap
ita, first in pounds of butter per farm,
first in the average number of pounds
of butter per cow, first in the per cap
ita valuo of dairy cows, otc. Tho vol
ume contains for the first time, some
visiblo proofs of Vermont's progress
lnsaKrletitturAl,llner' in -t4iUjsltAik.
photographic reproductions of animals
told about heretofore merely by figures
and words. Theso pictures nro by no
means the least attractive featuro of
the volumo, being beautifully repro
duced on the printed page. So, taken
all in all,, tho revised volume of Ver
mont Farms is calculated to do a great
deal of good for Vermont.

President Wilson has now dono what he
ought to have done many months ago.
The Germans have made a pretext of fair
dealing with America, but have gone
along with their submarine campaign,
sinking unarmed ships, many of them
belonging to neutral countries, and in sev
eral cases killing or endangering the lives
of Americans. This practice must stop,
the President now says, of we break with
Germany completely. This does not neces
sarily mean war, but it places this coun
try in a perilous position.

Ono curious effect of tho war is the de
crease in crime in Great Britain, as a re
sult of which 20 prisons have been or are
about to be closed. The explanation, how
ever, is simple. Many persons of a crim
inal bent have enlisted or have been draft
ed in the army, and work is so plentiful
and thetc is such a demand for labor that
there it less temptation to crime. More
over, tho regulation of tho liquor business
has caused a large falling olT in the con
sumption of intoxicants, nnd there has
been a coi responding deeiease in the
crimes due to drink.
After considering tho cvldcneo about
five hours the jury in the damago suit
of Lisle M. Carpenter of Brattleboro
against tho Central Vermont Railway
t;o. reported at i) o'clock last night 111
Newfane a verdict for Mr. Carpenter of
$ll,'J04.15. Although the previous ver-
mct or Jju.Liu 111 tins case was tno
largest over awarded in the Windham
county court in a personal damago suit,
last night's nward is nearly .2,000
larger. It is understood that tho caso
is likely to go again to tho supremo
court on exceptions to tho overruling of
tho uetenilunt h demurrers by tho coun
ty court, which will bring 'before tho
supreme court the question of liability.
.Mr. uarpentor is a lormer employe 01
the Central Vermont road and lost
leg as the result of being run over in
the yard at south .Londonderry in Jan
tinry, 1900. The trial was begun lato
Monday afternoon. Negotiations look
ing to a settlement which were in progress
hunday failed.
After court opened Monday after
noon about two and one half hours were
consumed in obtaining a jury. When the
entire panel of jurymen had been used
only 11 jurors were seated. Rather than
draw talesmen the attorneys on both sides
consulted and finally ngtced to seat one o
the panel who had been excused previous
lv.
Mr. Carpenter sued for $15,000 dam
aces a vear after the injury which re
suited in the loss of one leg. In 1012
tho ease was tried and resulted in a ver
diet for the plaintiff of $0,250, tho lnrg
est for personnl injuries ever awarded
by a jury in Windham county court. Tho
verdict was appealed by the defendant
company and the case was remanded
for a new trial last January.
Attorneys for tho plaintiff made a mo
tion to amend the original bill nnd this
was allowed, counsel for the company de
murring. The case was finally set for
trial as the first jury case of the present
court term on the question of the award
of damages only.
The, evidence on the part of the
plaintiff was finished at 4 o'clock Tues
day afternoon, and Wednesday was
taken up with the testimony for tho de
fendant company. Yesterday forenoon
three or tho arcuments woro made, a.
E. Cudworth of South Londonderry
opening for the plnintlff and Harold E.
Whitney nnd C. C. Fitts of Brattleboro
arguing for tho defendant. The closing
argument for the plnintitf was mado in
the afternoon by K. W. Gibson of Brat

Newell Leighton, 10, son of Charles
Close unon the heels of numerous oth
er important real estate and business
transactions comes the formal an
nouncement of Walter C. Piper of De
troit, Mich., prominent real estato Heal
er nnd former rcsidont of Brattleboro,
that he has bought of tho Bradley estate
what has been known as the Enton
place on the west side of Putney road,
1 .1 k 1. .1
niso wio couugu 011 i'.uiui suroi uuu
some additional land on tho Bradley
homo place, cast of Putney rond.
He intends to develop this land anil
sub-divide it into building lots of rea
sonable size to bo offered for salo at
reasonable prices with the idea of
building up that dcsirablo residential
section ot Hratticboro. it is pronanio
that it will be possible to placo theso
lots on the market next month or early
in June.
There arc something over 20 acres
in the Eaton place, and with what land
is acquired from the Brndloy property
not far from .10 acres will be available
for building lots. Streets will be laid
out in the most advantageous way pos
sible. These properties will be handled by
a newly organized Michigan company,
the Walter Collins Piper Co. Inc., and
after the preliminary work of develop
ment, which will bo in charge of Mr.
Piper's brother, Frank S. Piper, At
torney A. V. D. Piper, another brother,
will be tho local representative of tho
concern with tho headquarters of tho
company in tho offices of Attorney
Piper in the American building.
Air. Piper prepared for publication
the following statement of tho purchase
of tho property and his plans for its
development:
"It was called to my attention that
you might be interested in the news
item 01 my purchase lrom the urauiey
estate of what is known as tho Eaton
place, also the, cottage on North street
and some land off the home place, which
would be what an extension or Tyler
street on a circle to tho Putney road
would set off.
' ' This property I havo purchased with
the idea of having tho Eaton homestead
for a summer home, although I probably
will not occupy it this year, also with
tho idea that possibly the balance of
tho Eaton place, which I would not
wish for "our own nso, could bo sub
divided into building lots of a reason
able size and reasonable price, so that
this end of the villago could develop
with medium priced homes for residents
who might desire to live in this section
of the town.
"I appreciate, as others have, that
certain streets or sections in Brattle
boro have changed tho character of tho
residences. I believe that there is a
demand for some such residents to
build new and modern houses in what
surely must be considered the best sec
tion of Brattleboro.
I always havo desired to have a
summer placo at mv old homo and hopo
to raaico many visits mere in tno fu
ture. I havo incorporated a company
in Michigan to be known as Walter
Collins Piper, Inc., which will own title
to these properties, the officers of which
are: Walter C. Piper, president; Arthur
V. D; Piper, vico president, and Frank
S. Piper, secretary and treasurer.
"As soon as the development work
has been completed this spring, a cer
tain number of the lots on the Eaton
place and a few of the higher class, re
stricted, lots on the homo placo will bo
offered for sale. I have noticed a largo
number of real estate transfers and
sales that have been made during tho
last winter, and it is my opinion that
Brattleboro is to start on a real estato
movement which will bo greater than
any that has preceded it. I also havo
the opinion that there are a great many
people in the county and even outsido
of the state who are'thinking of moving
to Brattleboro to make a home, and I
believe the offering of this property for
sale will bring many out-of-town" pur
chasers into tho real estato market.
"My brother. Arthur V. D. Piper.
