FOR
NEW SCHEDULE OF WORKING
HOURS AND PAT NOW IN
EFFECT
This week a new working schedule
was put into effect at the Hennepin
Paper company's mill here whereby
the employes are working in three
shifts of eight hours. The plan is
working out well and the men seem
'very well satisfied with it.
For some time the paper mill em
ployes in this and other mills in the
northwest have been striving to get
«ight-houT schedules, with the same
pay, but they never succeeded. A
-strike two years ago in which the lo
cal mill and the one at Sartell and at
:Grand Rapi-ds figured in, was the final
Tesult of the men's demands for
•shorter hours, but this failed, men be
ing imported from the east to take
"their places.
Although the change at the local
-mill is not what was demanded by the
men when they went on strike, it is
^considered betteT. fhe pay of soine
-of the men remains the same but in
some instances it is lowered some
what. The shifts now are from 7 a.
m. to 3 p. m., 3 p. m. to 11 p. m. and
11 p. m. to 7 a. m. The old schedule
was 11 hours day and 13 hours night.
The change affects only the employes
•of the machine room and fireroom.
APPROVES CONCRETE PAVING
In response to an inquiry made Dy
City Clerk Victor Schallern upon ad
vice of the board of public works as
to the best kind of paving to use on
the streets here, the secretary of the
Xieague of Municipalities, of which
this city is a member, has advised
that for this city the concrete pave
ment is the best and the^ cheapest,
both in construction and in upkeep.
He stated that it is not slippery and
Is easily cleaned and is durable. He
estimated that the cost would be
about $1.50 per square yard. The pe
tition for the First street paving asks
•for concrete and the board, having
heard that concrete was not satisfac
tory in some places, decided to have
the clerk make inquiries before any
thing is done.

GRAY LOST ARM IN BAIL
WAY ACCIDENT
Olin Gray, formerly of this city,
who is now employed as brakeman
•with the Milwaukee railroad in Mon
tana, met with an accident recently
which resulted in the loss of his it
arm.
Gray climed onto the top of a tower
car while the same was being switch
ed in the yards and while standing on
the caT was caught in some suspended
CTOS9
wires. He fell between the
car and the engine and his arm was
so badly crushed by the wheels that
it was found necessary to amputate
it.
MAY HAVE SONS OF VETERANS
LODGE HEBE
L. Merritt of Detroit, who is in the
city for a visit with his brother-in
law, N. Battles, is a district officer of
the National organization of the Sons
of Veterans and came down here prin
cipally to make an effort to get
enough members to organize a local
camp of that order here. If he is
successful in getting the required
number of members, the district or
ganizer, who also lives at Detroit,
will come down and organize a camp.
MORE GROCERY STORES
Little Falls is soon to have two
more grocery stores. Joseph Brous
seau and John Kennedy are to start
tip in business in the store room just
east of H. W. Venner's confectionery,
on First street southeast and C. M.
Eric-kson of Brainerd is to locate in
the east room of the Harrison & Pe
terson building on Broadway. The
establishing of another one is also
under contemplation.
COUNCIL MEETS MONDAY NIGHT
The city council will hold an ad
journed regular meeting next Monday
evening, at the city hall. A number
of important matters will come before
the council and the meeting will prob
ably be a long one.
Frederick Martin, son of J. K. Mar
tin, who has been very ill, is convales
ing.
A. D. Davidson of Duluth, well
known here, is seriously ill with acute
stomach trouble. He was taken to
the Rochester hospital the first of the
week for an operation. Mrs. David
son and A. R. Davidson accompanied
him there.
The breaking of the main shaft -t
the Hennepin Paper company's mill
Wednesday evening necessitated a
shut down of about three hours. A
breakdown at this time is a serious
matter as the mill is flooded with or
ders.
First-class mail coming here from
Canada now bears the censor's
stamp. It is said that the censoring
is done to check information in rela
tion to the Canadian troops. This
will naturally make correspondence,
both personal and business, much
slower than usual.
The Luther league of the Swedish
Lutheran church will hold a literary
meeting at the church Sunday eve
ning. The program will be for the
benefit of foreign missions. A. Peter
son, a student at the G. A. college,
will give a talk and several musical
numbers will be given. An invita
tion is extended to all to attend.
A local party is in receipt of a
letter from an acquaintance in Alas
ka. An interesting thing about the
letter, which was written about ten
days ago, is that the writer stated
that the weather was very wet and
disagreeable there then, the snow be
ing nearly all gone. This shows that
Alaska, though many degrees farther
north of us,* has practically fhe same
•climate.

DISTRICT JUDGE HEARS FINAL
ARGUMENTS IN DUCLOS
BRICKYARDS CASE
A short special session of district
court was held here Wednesday with
Judge Roeser on the bench to hear
the arguments in the case of the Mor
rison County 'Lumber company and
W. H. Ryan vs., P. O. Duclos, et al.
The case came u£ at the regular tern
of court but owing to the absence
of one of the defendants had to be
adjourned. Depositions were taken
from O. P. Duclos, who lives in Mon
tana, and they arrived recently and
were read at the final hearing Wednes
day. The plaintiffs in the case seek
to attach the brickyard property by
the foreclosure of mechanics' liens
which they hold against it since the
new building was constructed. Judge
Roeser took the case under advisement
and will render a decision later. This
case has been in the courts for sever
al years.
A motion to give Victor Edoff the
custody of his little son was granted.
Mr. Edoff was granted a divorce from
his wife at the last term of district
court.
IN THE DATS OF THE STAGE
COACH
Long Prairie Leader: Judge E. A.
Lewis of probate court received a
brief statement yesterday of the death
on April 9 of Michael O'Connor in the
hospital for insane at Anoka. Back
of this terse notice, however, there is
sufficient to write a history that
would pertain not only to O'Connor
himself but to the early struggles of
the people of this section.
It was 40 years ago that O'Conner
was taken away in a stage coach—an
adjudged incurable insane person.
The order for his commitment to the
institution at St. Peter—there was no
hospital in Anoka at the time—came
from Judge of Probate William
O'Brien. It was in 1376. O'Connor
had been a resident of Reynolds
township.
Because of the fact that there was
no railroad it was necessary to make
the trip to St. Cloud overland in a
stage coach. It required three days
in which to make the trip and cost
the county $75.00. C. E. Harkens,
who was afterwards clerk of court 'or
Todd county for a number of years,
took the patient to the St. Peter in
stitution.
Mr. Harkens, upon his return, sub-'
mitted a detailed expense account of
the trip. It was shown that 60 cents
had been spent for tobacco for the pa
tient, indicating that the patient on
sumed 20 cents worth each day. The
report of Mr. Harkens also showed
that the railroad fare was $3.55 for
one person from St. Cloud to St. Paul.
The fare from Long Prairie -o St.
Paul, twice the distance, is now but
$2.85. The two-cent rate was evi
dently not in effect at that time.
The old eports of the c'aSe also
show that one physician was neces
sary in adjudging patients insane at
the time, whereas it is now necessary
that three sit in judgment. Dr. W.
H. Ewing gave testimony on O'Con
nor's case. He was one of the first
physicians in this section of the coun
try. O'Connor was taken from St.
Peter to Fergus Falls and from that
institution to Anoka. He was the
second patient to be sent from this
county to an insane hospital. O'Con
nor was about 70 «ears of age and
was born in Ireland.
MARRIED
A pretty church wedding took place
Wednesday at 2:30 p. m. at the Swed
ish Lutheran Bethel church of this
city when Miss Esther Setterstrom,
oldest daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Axel
Setterstrom of Ninth street south
west, became the bride of Nels Olson,
also of this city.
The church was beautifully deco
rated with streamers, potted plants
and evergreens. The bridal party
marched to the altar to the strains of
Lohengrin's wedding march, played

strom, a sister of the bride was maid
of honor. Albert Enke" and Eric
Johnson were best men. Rev. Elof
Peterson officiated. During the ser

Promise Me.''
The bride was gowned in a beauti
ful dress of white embroidered silk
georgette crepe and she wore a tulle
veil, made cap effect and carried a
shower bouquet of roses and lilies of
the valley. Miss Anderson, brides
maid, wore a dress of pale green crepe
de^ chine and carried white carnations.
Miss Minnie Carlson wore a dress of
green suesine silk and also carried
white carnations. The maid of honor
wore a dress of white silk crepe trim
med with rosebuds.
After the ceremony a reception was
held at the I. O. O. F. hall, at which
fully two hundred invited guests were
present.
The couple received a large number
of beautiful and useful weddinsr
gifts.
After a short wedding trip they
will be at home in flats in the Bart
lett building on the West side. Mr.
Olson is employed as papermaker at
the papermill here.
Mrs. Amanda Field of this city and
Frank H. Forsberg of Clay county,
S. D., were united in marriage Mon

Peterson, pastor of Swedish Lutheran
church, at the parsonage. They left

G. N. RY. CO. ALLEGED TO BE
CIRCULATING MISREPRE
SENTED PETTTIONB
Considerable effort, some of which
is 'evidently being exerted by false
means, is being put forth to get the
route of the Jefferson highway to go
through Stearns and Todd counties in
stead of through Morrison county
and! Little Falls, as origu&Uy planned,
it i* alleged. Most of Shis work ,is
being done by the GreafcNorther n, .Jit
seetns, this 'company having circulated
petitions all along the line to have
the route changed..
According to the following para
graph, taken from a letter from R.
W.Gosslee of Menagha to R. M. Mil
iar}, secretary of the local Commer
cial club, the Great Northern is mis
representing the petitions, one of
wqich was. presented to him. The ex
ceipt from Mr. Gosslee's letter fol
io#*:'.
'-Here's something perbaps you
haven't heard. The other evening
one of our members was at the train
in the evening and the conductor
handed him a printed form of petition
with the information that it was for
Jefferson highway is originally laid
out tmd requested that he circulate it
around the town. This citizen started
out to do this without first reading
the contents, and after getting two
signatures presented it to yours
trlpy. Naturally, I stopped to read
it over before signing, and I found
it1 to be a petition for the route as
fat as St. Cloud then up through
Stearns county, etc., to Wadena,
thence, the original route. It. is need
less to say that the petition went no
further as our people are stickers to
the end and absolutely loyal. I might
say that this petition is gotten out by
the Great Northern railway company
and has been circulated in every
to^rn along their line. I really do
not think though that it will have a
vety heavy influence in the final sum
ming up."
Mr. Gosslee also stated in his let
ted that a meeting had been held at
Beniidji recently at which all the
totals along the line had passed reso
lutions to stand pat on the proposed
route.
41 VISITING
TOWNS EMPLOY
NURSES
Twenty-six Minnesota towns, in ad
dition to the three large cities, Min
neapolis, St. Paul and Duluth, are em
ploying visiting nurses all. the year,
sap JJI, I. J. Murphy of the Minne-
sota Public Health association. This
includes most of t&6 cities above
5,000 in population, and a few towns
below 2,000 have visiting nurses for
a cbnsldsraMfe time. All towns of ox€T
3,000 population could employ a visit
ing nurse to advantage the entire
year, Dr. Murphy says, and smaller
towns could group with other com
.mjjjnities in getting a nurse. In many
parts Of the «tate no doubt county
nurse would be the most practical
plan, he thinks.
"Some cities seem to utilize the
visiting nurses to a fuller extent than
others,'' Dr. Murphy continues. '1 In
Albert Lea, Austin, Brainerd, Eve
leth, Faribault, Owatonna, St. Peter
and South St. Paul, besides the school
work, the nurses do tuberculosis work
and in some cases act as assistant
health officers, contagious disease in
spectors, and truant officers.
"Besides these towns," he adds,
"and the three large cities, which
employ nurses the year round, fifteen
towns employ nurses during the
school terms. These towns are: Au
rora, Biwabik, Cloquet, Chisholm,
Gilbert, Hastings, Hibing, Mankato,
Red Wing, Rochester, St. Cloud, Still
water, Virginia, Windom and Wino
na.
In these towns the services of the
nurse should be recognized as being
of as much value during the summer
months to the embryo school children,
the health association official warns,
as it is to the older children during
the school terms.
SUMMER TERM TO OPEN JUNE 13
Those interested in the development
of country life appreciate the value
of having for the public school teach
ers who are informed regarding agri
culture and home-making.
The best teachers expect to attend
summer school somewhere, and the
summer is the best time of the year
to get training in agriculture and
home economics. The state depart
ment of education maintains summer
training schools at University Farm,
St. Paul, at the school of agriculture,
Morris, and at the school of agricul
ture, Crookston. Regular certificate
subjects as well as agriculture, man
ual training, and home economics are
offered at each.
The summer term will open June 12
and will close July 21. Board and
room can be had at any of the schools
at reasonable prices.
Bulletins have just been issued de
scribing the sessions and will be sent

MUNICIPAL COURT
Four young men of this city pleaded
guilty to being drunk and disorderly
before Municipal Judge Lyon Tues
day afternoon, and were each fined
$2 and costs, in each case amounting
to $8.25. Three of the four are under
age, and refused to divulge in what
manner they secured the liquor. A
number of our young men have also
let their idea of fun take in loud and
indecent talk and the destroying of
property^ and it is to be hoped that
this action of the authorities will
serve as a useful lesson.
On Monday morning before Judge
Lyon the case of Chas. Jensen vs. F.
P. Farrow was tried. The plaintiff
asked $150 damages for the death of
his^ setter dog last November. He
claimed that the dog was killed by
one of the livery automobiles. Judge
Lyon took the case under advisement
and will render a decision later.
Louis Kuschel brought an action
against the Monarch Elevator com
pany and John Billstein in municipal
court Tuesday morning, suing for the
value of a horse which he claimed
died from being used by Mr. Bill
stein. He asked $200 for the death of
the animal. The judge took the case
under advisement. •»•.
