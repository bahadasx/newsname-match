RESOLUTIONS.
The Sunday School of the Mt.
Vernon Christian Church, Mt
Vernon, Kentucky, in regular
session on Sunday, April 16, 16IO,
unanimously adopted the follow
ing resolutions :
First, That our school has sus
tained a great loss, by the removal
of our Superintendent, Mr. 0. C.
Davis, to Winchester. Kentucky,
to be followed in a few weeks by
his estimable wife and lovable
daughters.
Second, That Mr. Davis was ef
ficient and progressive as a Sup
erintendent, untiriugin his efforts,
unselfish m his service, self-sacri
ficing in bis devotion, generous
towards every appeal and loyal to
every co-.laborer.
Third, That a copy of these
resolutions be sent to the Weokly
Bulletin for publication, a copy to
the Christian Church at Win
chester, Kentucky, and a copy be
published in the Mt. Vernon Sig-
Not long since the Signal cop
ted from Lancaster Record, the
following, recommended by the
latter as requisites for ' Booming
a Town:"
1st. Men of "Push and energy,
men who erect good buildings;
organize stock companies; estab
lish factories; secure railroads;
work for public improvements.
-and use every means in their pow
er to locate in their city men of
this class." Closing by saying:
"Make the town attractive to
t rangers."
We, and every good citizen of
Mt. Vernon, indorse what our
clever editors have given us thru
their papers:
They, of course, meant that
class of "strangers" that are wel
comed in every progressive com
munity, who add by their pros
ence to the moral aud religious
growth.
Mt. Vernon has the distinction
of having some men who are
classy if not "classic, as "Boost
ers."
not only that, but the higher
courts have decided that a two
thirds majority is not necessary
to decide a popular question that
a majority are in favor of.
In otherwords the majority
have a right to be favored rather
than the minority. While we are
commending ourselves and ex
ending mutual congratulations
for what has been accomplished,
let us make a furtuer survey of our
social and civic environments.
With all of boosted improve
ments, may we quote from Holy
Writ? 'Yet lackest thou one
thing. "Our Savior said: "Clean
liness is next to Godliness," one
of Our lawyers quoted on a recent
occasion: Now the application,
and by the way the most impor
tant of all the measures we have
mentioned:
The one thing needed so much
is Water Works we repeat,
Water Works.
We shall never get safely and
permanently seated on the "Water
Wagon" till we have Water
Works, furnishing a bountiful
supply for drinking and bathing
as well as cooking and Hushing
our gutters and side walks.
There is no need of reminding
our people of what they already
Know of the abundant supply of
pure water near bv aud the typo
graphic advantages of erecting a
water tower or resorvoir, the latter
preferable. Furthermore, we need
not point to, nor elaborate on tlje
epidemic of typhoid fever, that
has been, and remains a menace
to our town and surrounding com
munity. In our haste and zeal
for the pushing of commercial en
terprizes we have ignored, or at
least neglected the most vital
question to the progress of any
community.
The sanitary condition of the
homo, the school, the streets and
allies, barns and hog pens chick
en roosts and pig styes., are of far
more importance than streets,side
walks, lawns or back yards. The
neglect of hygienic precaution in
matters referred to inolves the
question of good health, yea, life
itself. Sooner or later your life
or mine or that of some loved one,
may be the price paid for our pro
crastination. It is only a ques
tion of time when we'll have water
works. The plan and rough esti
mate of cash is practically under
stood by some of our business
men. It remains for some man
in whom we have confidence as a
conservative business man to take
some other business man into his
confidence and agree on a plan.
The time is ripe for thisjinitiative,
and eliminating partisanship, and
sacrifacing some U our prejudices,
we can and must have water, tresh
water, clean water, in abundance.
We ned to have a washing away
of our political sins, and we ven
ture ihe assertion that enough
money has been spent to have put
a water plant in Mt. Vernon, for
that which does not remove polit
ical or any other kind of sin. On
the coutrary it makes the dye
deeper and blacker, that send
souls to perdition. Who will be

While we, as an individual, may
not be in sympathy with
thing that is boosted, we can
point with pride to several things
that Mt- Vernon's business men
have been active and successful
in pushing to a satisfactory issue.
First in importance is the "Gpod
Roads" movement. .
They 63 been eminently suc
cessful as leaders in the location
of Boone Way and Dixie-Boone
Highway.
The people who boosted and
brought to a successful termina
tion, the bond issue in favor of
High School and Good Roads are
entitled to our gratitude and ap
preciation. To the business men of Mt.
Vernon we are indebted for the
installation and excellent service
rendered by our Light and Power
plant.
It may be said that we have
passed the uncertain and doubtful
stage in the, bond issue campaign,

The first stroke of the brush will prove the superior covering hidipg
power of Kurfee3PureLead and Zinc Paint. You will immediately appre
ciate the difference in spreading a paint composed of:
80 Lead and 20 Zinc
and the paint you have heretofore been using.
In no other paint will you find 80 Lead; nor will you find paint'
of such heavy body.
Ordinary paints do not cover like Eurfees paint, for the imple reason
that they do not contain sufficient Lead to make them cover. You know
a paint must contain Lead and lota of it, if you expect it- to cover and
wear well.
If you get Kurf ees 80 Lead and 20 Zinc Paint, you don't need to
buy as many gallons for the job as you would of ordinary paint, nor will
you need to repaint the job so soon.
Kurf ees Outside White is the whitest white; makes the whitest houses;
and the colors are all good and permanent. Let us figure on your job.
