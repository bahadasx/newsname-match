was residing in Rob we 11, heard
of the marriage and came to
Clovis on the early morning
train. Upon reaching the house
of the "newly weds," on west

Debs In Clovis
As per previous arrangement
Eugene V. Debs visited this city
and spoke to a large audience
Friday evening.
Owing to the continued rain
and snow the meeting was held
in the Lyceum Theatre instead
of the Airdome. The inclement
weather also reduced the size of
the audience very materially,
yet the large theatre building's
seating capacity could not ac
comodate the crowd.
The speaker spoke along the
lines usual to Solialistic orators,
paying his respects to Capitalists
and War.
Mr. Debs impresses one as a
man above the ordinary, and as
being sincere and much in earn
est, evidently believing that the
principales he advocates are the
panacea for our national and
local i!is.
As a whole, the address was
interesting and entertaining re
gardless of one's political views.

Wilson Sends Ultimatum
to Germany
Amarica's last word on sub
marine warfare is sent to Ger
many. All Diplomatic relations
will end if attacks are continued.
May mean war.
Washington, April 19. Presi
dent Wilson told congress, as
sembled in joint session, shortly
after 1 o'clock this afternoon,
he had given Germany irrevert
able notification that the United
States will break off diplomatic
relations if her illegal submarine
campaign is continued.
A note, America's last word,
practically an ultimatum, and
demanding an immediate reply,
presumably was in the Berlin
foreign office as the president
was speaking. It was dispatch
ed last night in accordance with
the president's plan to have it
before the German government
at the same moment he was ad
dressing the American congress.
The president asked no action
whatever of congress. He simp
ly informed it of the accumula
tion of facts proving that Ger
many's assurances to the United
States are being violated: that
the submarine campaign, de
spite the earnest protests of the
United States, is being conduct
ed with renewed vigor in con
travention of all the laws of
nations and humanity, and that
he means to sever relations un
less it is brought within the law.
Diplomatic history of the world
shows that such a caurse is al
most certain to be followed by
war.
Road Builder
State road builder, Jones, who
is under the supervision of chief
engineer, r rench, was in Clovis
Tuesday morning. In response
to an inquiry by a News repre
sentative, as to the progress his
force are making in the con
struction of a branch highway
from Clovis to Fort Sumner he
stated-' "The grading camp is
now located five miles ibis Bide
of Melrose, and are making
satisfactory progress' There
cent rains have assisted very
materially in the road construc
tion work and Mr. Jones thinks
that when the new road is finally
completed it will lessen the dis
tance materially between the
points designated.
