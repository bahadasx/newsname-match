REPORT BRINGS
MEN TO ARMS
What was probably the highest
pitch of excitement ever aroused in
Lordsburg, was manifest Sunday
evening about 5) o clock when a
telegram was received here from
Separ, eighteen miles east, telling
of the approach of a band of sev-enty-five
armed Mexicans, who
were alleged to have been seen by
party of tourists, who were
lunching near Separ. Simultane
ously the word was received by
the operator in Deming and a posse
organized there to protect No. 9,
on the Southern Pacific, which was
about due to leave.
According to all accounts the
rue version of the affair was t
two women and a man traveling
eastward in an automobile rushes
into the telegraph office at Separ
Sunday night, telling the tele
grapher that they had been eating
lunch about two miles west of Se
par, on the Borderland route, and
had seen a band of armed, mount
ed Mexicans, numbering about seventy-five,
moving westward. The
names of the parties were not se
cured nor could their destination
be traced. Immediately the news
was spread broadcast.
It was announced throughout
Lordsburg and the men brought
lorward all the arms contained in
the town, supplying those not
equipped and preparing for any
thing that might arise. It v
announced in all the churches and
messengers visited all the homes,
telling of the report from Separ.
The women and children were ad'
vised to go to the schoolhouse,
where lights were dimmed and
guards stationed. Patrols were
.organized and the borders of the
town carefully watched.
Constable Oscar Allen and
mounted posse left at once for S
par and scoured the country where
the Mexicans were alleged to have
been seen. The place where the
auto party lunched was found but
no trace of horses could be found
.at any place in the country. No
ipersons had seen any Mexicans
and no news of any character was
ascertained.
Meanwhile in Lordsburg the
citizens armed themselves and
were prepared for any attack. It
is estimated that over 300 armed
men and boys gathered in the
streets ready to meet whatever
might come. The crowd was or
derly and every man kept cool
Some took various stands oh the
east side, while everyone was ready
for protecting the town.
Number 9 was held up an hour
at Deming, where railroad offi
cers, and attaches of the sheriff's
pff ice organized a posse of 30 men
who accompanied the train to
Lordsburg. Two machine guns
were mounted on the train. Num
ber 9 arrived here at 1 o'clock a.
m. with all lights dimmed. The
Deming men mounjted their ma
chine gun at points most suited in
town and offered their aid to the
Lordsburg men. By 3 o'clock the
excitement had subsided and the
Deming people returned home on
.No. 102 at 4 o'clock.
During the rest of the morning
the Lordsburg men kept vigil and
did not leave their posts until
and 8 o'clock.
To further the excitement there
were rumors circulated that the
Mexicans at the 85 Mine were act
ing suspiciously and that "trou
ble was brewing." Men from
Lordsburg went up to the mine and
found that conditions there were
peaceful and the camp void of any
disturbance. Sundry reports were
told of how the men were sending
their women folks to Lordsburg
during the evening and how they
had gathered together about
o'clock. However, all was well at
.the camp.
, While the affair or Sunday night
lid not necessitate the action of
the organized force, it gave the peo
pie an idea of what would be done
in case of trouble. Our men are
prepared and were given an oppor
tunity to show their colors.
CHIEF DEPUTY APPOINTED

On the road to the Playas val
ey about a mile southwest of
eidendorf Monday afternoon.

in the back by a Mexican named
Gonzales who later made his es
cape. Ballard and trie Mexican who
was one ot his employees came
to Lordsburg Monday morning
for the Mexican to receive medi
cal treatment Mr. Ballard tran
sacted business at the local bank

thought he carried with him some
money. The couple were return
ing in a wagon and after they
had passed Leidendorf the Mexi
can turned upon Ballard "with a
sharp knife stabbing him in the
back four times. There wa3 no
altercation between the two and
the attack was most vicious.

from the wagon, and out-ran
Gonzales, reaching the Nellie Bly
mine where he fainted from the
0S3 of blood. Col. B.W.Randall
brought him to Lordsburg where
the wounds were dressed by Dr.
Crocker. .Mr. Ballard was able
to walk but was very weak.

Chase, Joe Olney, Russell Wing
and, Eugene Montague who
motored to the scene of the stab
bing. The wagon was traced in
to the Animas side of the valley.
A posse from the 85 mine of
about ten men joined in pursuit
and a numher of citizens from
Lordsburg aided in scouring the
mountains in search of Gonzales,
The bloodhound kept here by the
Southern Pacific was taken to the
scene but neither at nignt or in
the morning would he take the
trail which had been discerned
by the posse.
All during the night and morn
ing and far into the afternoon
the country was throughly search
ed but the man was not found.

stand and fence the park located
on the McGrath track west of town.
The cost will come to ?r2G.O?, not
including the labor. Contractor
Willia'ii McSwain presented the

imously. There will be 9100 feet
of lumber in the grand stand and
1300 feet in the fence. It is ex
pected that much of the labor will

Morris & Wright have donated
suits to the Lordsburg Baseball

quality manufactured by Spauld-
mg and will have the lettering
"Lordsburg Peppers."
IN FAVOR OF HOSPITAL
There has been much favorable
comment launched within the
past week for the establishment
of a Ladies' Hospital for Lords
burg. Since the incorporation of
this City it is believed that the
assistance of the legislature, both
in the erection and maintenance
of the institution, could be
secured.
Lordsburg is greatly in need of
a hospital and should the project
not be too burdensome one should
be established along the same
lines as the general hospitals at
Silver City and Deming.
The two local practicing physi
cians have extended liberal con
tributions and with the support
of the mines, railroads and in
dividual interests is is quite pos
sible that a hospital could be
made a realization with the prop
er energy behind it.
STATE OFFICIALS HERE
On a tour of New Mexico to in
spect the public schools, State Su
perintendent of Public Instruction
Alvan N. White and State Superin
tendent of Industrial Education L.
C. Mersfelder, both of Santa Fe,

They are traveling in an automo
bile. The two state officials, in com
pany with County School Superin
tendent Isabel L. Eckles Monday

Lof Grant county. The first days'
itinerary included Fierro, Han
pver, Santa Rita, Arenas and Cen
tral. Tuesday the party made a
trip down the Mimbres river and
Wednesday they visited White Sig
nal, Tyrone and then on to Lordsburg.

Those who have orchards in

chance for a fair apple crop this
season. Although the peaches
were entirely destroyed by the
cold weather, some of the plums

However, as we were visited by
a killing frost last May, it is too
early to forecast the first crop
with any certainty.
A pedagogue employed in a
chool just across the Arizona
border, evidently believing that
he was making money too slowly,
sold a large number of his friends
a formula for making soft soap,
and the soap a3 demonstrated
was a wonder. Some of the .
credulous ones mortgaged their
homes to buy state rights. When
the supply of prospective soap
makers was exhausted, the
smooth soap man departed 'twixt
dark and daylight, and they have
not seen him since. The worst
of the matter is, the formula
wont make soap, soft or other
wise. It is not safe to mention
soft soap in that district
