MEXICANS WATCHING
SUBMARINE CONTROVERSY
More Talkative About That Than
About the Pursuit of Villa.
El Paso, Texas, April 20. On Mon
day the Chihuahua City newspapers
printed despatches supposed to have
come from Juarez, stating that Presi
dent Wilson was about to deliver an
ulltmatum to Germany and that war
would be declared within a week. This
information was brought here today
by Americans returning from Chihua
hua, who brought copies of the news
papers in which the despatches ap
peared. The arrivals said that the news of
a crisis between Germany and the
United States was common talk in
Chihuahua City on Sunday, 48 hours
before the facts were made public in
this country. On Monday an Ameri
can who visited General Gutierrez
was greeted with this remark: "Well, I
suppose the Mexican situation has be
come of minor importance now that
the United States is going to war with
Germany."
The Americans who returned here
said that the Mexicans were being
kept fully acquainted with every step
in the negotiations between Berlin and
Washington through an official agency
in Mexico City and that they knew
more about the crisis between the
United States and Germany than they
did about the pursuit of Villa.

Petrograd. via London. April 20.
6.18 p. m. The fall of Trebizond hns
given rise to a fresh crop of rumors
that Turkey is approaching Russia
with peace overtures, but it is authori
tatively stated in official circle that
no such proposals will be considered
bf the Russian government. Voicing
a couviction that Turkey is a defeat
ed nation and not in a position to
make any terms, the Petrograd Ga
zette declares:
"We may now consider one of our
enemies finished. The taking of Tre
bizond has so disorganized the Tur
kish defensive plans that all that re
mains for her is to lay down her arms
and ask mercy. Sl:e already 1ms
sought ways to a separate peace, nut
has met with the absolute refusal of i dif e
ner opponent wiio is detei mined to
close no separate agreements. Turkey's
hour has struck and it is not imorob
able that she will in the near future,
entirely disappear from the map."

Washington. April 20. The German
government has agreed to permit ex

000 tons of dyestufTs, lack of which
has seriously affected American tex
tile manufacturers. Notification to
this effect was contained in a note
delivered today by Count Von Bern-
storff, the German ambassador, to Sec
retary Lansing.
Germany Makes "a Single Exception."
The communication explains that
while Germany refused at first to per
mit exportation of dyestufTs unless
they be exchanged for American good.
now excluded from Germany by the
British blockade, after careful consid
eration of the situation it has been
seen "that this blockade has resulted
in serious embarras-wnent to those
.merican Industries which are in need
of dvestuffs" and the imperial German
government now is prepared to make
"a single exception" in permitting ex
portation in this instance.
Purely American Consumption.
It is required only that the dyes
shall be consumed by American man
ulacturers and not re-exported to
Great Britain or her allies.
It is expected that the state depart
ment immediately will make represen
tations to Great Britain to insure the
safe arrival of dyestufTs in this coun
try. A translation of the text of to
day's communication addressed by
Ambassador Von Bemstorft to Secre
tary Lansing follows:

on the mound which had probably been
raised over the grave of some Viking
leader at Valtos, on the Island of Lew
is, one of the Hebrides group, recently
discovered a number of Viking relics
of the ninth century. They consisted
of a pair of large oval brooches of a
noted Scandinavian type, a small
brooch, a round, disc-shaped ornament
with a central boss and a decoration of
interlaced loops, a small buckle, a por
tion of a bronze chain probably used
io connect the large oval brooches and
a single big amber bead. These arti

heavy gales in the sand close to the

Tokio, April 20. Enemy submarine
activity in the Mediterranean has prac

of Japanese silk is sent to Italy every
year, and the cessation of shipments is
causing loss to Japanese as well as
inconvenience to the United States.
After being subjected to finishing pro

NOTE TO GERMANY APPROVED
BY ARGENTINA PAPERS
Washington. April 20. According to
authentic information reaching VwTsh
Ington, (Treat Lritain and France, in
their joint note replying to the Amen
can protest against interferences with
neutral trade, make no attempt to dis
pute principles contended for by the
United States but insist that those
principles have been given legal in
terpretation and application by the al
lies in their blockade of Gernuny and
Austria.
Relies on Precedents.
This note, which will be handed to
the state department withl r.the next
day or two by the British or French
ambassador, is understood to be lung
and extremely technical, treating the
whole subject on a purely legal basis
and relying largely upon the prece
dents laid down by the United States
in the Civil war. It is said the allies
assume that the United States gov
ernment does not contend that it has
the right to ship goods without re
striction into Germany or Austria
through contiguous neutral countries,
such as Holland, Sweden and Denmark.
Limiting cf Imports Into Neutra
Countries.
The concession cf the right to block
ade an enemy country which is uni
versally regarded as necessarily car
rying with it the r:ht to regulate the
admission of goods to the neutral
country, evidently destined to be trans
ferred to the enemy. Consequently it
is contended that a neutral country
such as Holland, of goods that might
be of use to Grmany and Austria, to
t'n amount normally consumed in the
neutral country.
Right to Search Vessels.
Moreover it is argued that an incl
dent to the exercise of this richt of
regulation .f imports is the ricnt to
search vessels upproaching the neutral
country, in this connection the aiiies
hold that whiie in early days it was
possible to conduct such a search at
sea. conditions of modm sea trathc
have m.-n'.e this imnr-ssiV.le; hence i
has become necessary to take the
neutral thin to the rcarest convenient

Ships' Papers Are Not Reliable.
Another tr-ir.: t".ado by the allies is
that the ch.-ir-ict'T of ships' paper
have changed torapletly owing to thr
