FARM SUCCESS SURE
Young Men and Women Should
Stick to Agriculture.
Country Citizen Has Advantages Over
His City Relative When It Comes
to the Real Opportunities.
(By G. H. ALFORD, Extension Division
Maryland Agricultural College.)
WE think we are facing a
new condition of affairs in
the drift of the young peo
pie from the country to
the cities, in the steady rise in the
cost of living, and in the decline of
our food exports. It is true, for us,
this is a new situation, but for the
world it is as old as civilization.
Plutarch thundered against the de
population of the rural districts. Jus
tinian, the great lawmaker, was in
favor of legislation designed to keep
people on the farm. The great Ro
man emperor, Augustus, before the
Christian era, saw that his empire
was being undermined and called to
him the poets of the nation and com
manded them to sing of the, beauties
and profits of country life.
The young people of this country
have been taught in their homes, in
the schools, and through the literature
placed in their hands, largely to over
estimate the advantages of city
life and they have not been taught
correctly to comprehend its disadvan
tages. Likewise, the people of both
city and country exaggerate the dim
culties and drudgery of country life
and fail to appreciate fully its great
and peculiar advantages.
Low City Wages.
One middle-aged man in New York
city, in answering the question, why
young men leave the farm, says: "I
wish to say that I speak from expe
rience, for I am one of the army of
deserters, and like thousands of oth
ers, am now too poor financially to
go back to the farm, and too proud
to go back broke. I know a great
number here in New York city who
are in the same position as I am.
While I know many country boys, I
know but very few who do not wish
they had stayed on the old farm, and
everyone tries to make his friends up
the state think he is happy and very
prosperous on a salary of twenty-five
dollars per week, when, at the same
time, he is trying to make both ends
meet and still live respectably."
Probably the best way to convince
boys that it is best to remain on the
farm is b3y such methods of farming
as will yield the necessary profits to
provide the necessities, comforts, and
some of the luxuries of life. There
are thousands of small farmers culti
vating farms with labor-saving tools
and keeping plenty of good live stock,
who are making the work of their
own hands bring them in more than
fifteen hundred dollars annually. Com
paratively few men in towns and
cities get as large a salary. The farm
er grows his living on his farm and
pays no house rent. The larger part
of his fifteen hundred dollars is net
profit. The fifteen hundred dollar
town man can hardly make both ends
meet
Demonstrations, lectures, bulletins,
books and contact with men trained
and paid to advise and help him are
now his privileges. He has a chance
with tremendous odds in his favor to
be a man-and a successful farmer.
Permanent Prosperity Sure.
It is unquestioned that we are now
entering a permanent era of high
priced farm products and high priced
land. This being true, it is advisable
for farmers' boys to buy land and
grow high priced foodstuffs.
The country schools and churches
are rapidly being consolidated, and
made the equal of the best in the
towns. Our industrial and commer
cial affairs will soon be adjusted so
that farmers will receive their full
share of what the consumer pays.
Farmers will soon have an equal
chance with other men in securing
capital to supply their farms and
homes with labor-saving and wealth
producing equipment The business
world expects food of the right kind,
and at prices commensurate with pro
gressive living and is joining the
farmers in advocating the establish
ment of financial institutions that
will afford capital to meet the legit
mate needs of farmers.
The farmer and his family many
now have all city conveniences. Wa
ter, electric lights, telephone, fireless
cookers, gasoline engines, automo
biles, and so on, can be obtained for
a comparatively small outlay of
money.
The time has come when county
agents, agricultural specialists, prin
cipals of agricultural high schools,
and, in fact, agriculturists for all
kinds of agricultural work will be
selected from among the successful
farmers and dragged from the farm.
More farmers will be elected govern
ors and sent to congress. There is a
bright future for the educated, suec
cessful farmer.
GETTING THE SELUNG HABIT
Farming is a business as well as a
science. The business of the farmer
is to produce things and sell them for
profit. This is also the business of all
the manufacturing plants throughout
the world. A farmer is not only a
business man, but also a manaufactnur
er, and might be considered a mer
chant, since his income is dependent
on the products that he sells for profit
FARM OPPORTUNITY
BETTER THAN EVER
City Dwellers Struggle for Their
Meager Comforts.
GOOD FINANCIAL PROSPECT
Wisconsin Official Shows Why Young
Men and Women Should Stay in
Country and Help Make the
Nation's Real Wealth.
(By MATTHEW 8. DUDGEON of Wis
consin Free Library Commission.)
EN years ago-twenty years
ago-all the alert, energetic
farm boys were leaving the
farm for the city. They did
this because they wanted to make
money, because they wanted to see
life. If they stayed on the farm, they
were not only sure to be lonely and to
be in unattractive surroundings, but
they were sure to be poor. But times
have changed.
r Today, if you go through a fair!y
a prosperous farming community, you
will find the telephone in nearly every
farmhouse and a daily delivery of mail
bringing the daily newspapers to
t every door. You will find many farm
houses better fitted up with con
i veniences and comforts than are the
homes of the average city laborer.
a Because there are better roads and
t better horses and better buggies and
more automobiles, you will find that
the farmer and his family are no long.
er imprisoned in the farmhouse, but
move about and have as much social
Y life and as great an opportunity to
meet each other as do the city man
and his family. Many a farm boy
who is ten miles in the country, with
his automobile, can and frequently
° does, reach town in less time than it
takes the average man in the big city
to reach his business from his city or
° suburban home The boy who stays
on the farm need no longer look ahead
to a lonesome, cheerless existence.
Prices Going Higher.
p Never before has the American farm
y boy had so promising a financial pros
e pect as be has at the present time.
e Profits are surer than they ever were
, and they bid fair to increase. Prices
are high and they are going higher.
American consumers are demanding
e more and better farm products and
stand ready to pay better prices. They
Sare going more directly to the farm
d for what they want and the farmer is
e getting a bigger share of what they
*- pay. The war and the disturbances
Is that have grown out of it have inter*
K rupted, if they have not permanently
cut off, the channels of trade for for
a eign farm products, so that the Amer
ican farmer is likely in the future to
d have open to him the markets of the
n- world as they never before have been.
Id Skill and experience in handling
rt soils, in rotating crops, in selecting
at seeds, and in planting and tending,
. is rendering a total failure of any
is crop unusual and unlikely. But as
up-to-date farming is now carried on,
the failure of a single crop is no long
er the disaster which it formerly was.
No one is now a one-crop :armor. To
e day's successful farmer hu.s not only
to a variety of crops which constitutes
reserve resources when the yield or
the price of a single crop fails him.
but he now gets revenues from a
W score of sources, from his corn and
rh oats and wheat and potatoes as of
ad old, but also from his truck garden,
le from his orchard and small fruit, from
id his fat hogs and cattle, from his
purebred stock animals sold at fancy
s prices, from his dairy products, and
Id even from his poultry.
ie Big Financial Returns,
r' In fact, the farmer who formerly
O was considered a plodder working at
ill one thing, with one idea and one re
source, is now getting to be a re
al sourceful business man, aa adminis
II trator, an alert student of the mar
Id ket and finance, a well-read profession
- al man who understands the science
a of his profession.
d The boy who stays on the farm to
Sbecome a successful farmer is enter
he ing into an occupation where brains,
h- intelligence and study, energy and
at alertness are getting as large flnan
t clial returns as they are in any hu
man activity. Moreover, he is enter
y ing into an occupation where work
a- ing and living conditions are more
5s universally attractive and healthful
o- than are the surroundings of any group
or of workers in the world. What more
of can he hope for if he goes to the
city?
SMADE FORTUNE ON PEANUTS
be A week or two ago a man died in
ul Virginia who was called the "Peanut
m King." He had made a pretty good
sized fortune buying the peanut crop
in his vicinity, storing it until the
market was favorable and then sell
ing it. Not only had he made a for
tune himself, but the farmers of that
vicinity had always been provided
IT with a market at fair prices and the
dealers had always known where to
a go to purchase peanuts. In other
er words, he had earned his money, not
or because he was a producer, but be
ll cause he had the ability to bring the
ut producer and the consumer together.
