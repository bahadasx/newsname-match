.Must (.'case Submarine Warfare
at Once or Forfeit Friendship
of the United States?Re?
ply Anxiously Awaited.
Washington, April 19.?President
Wilson's long expected final warning
to Germany that tho United States
will break off diplomatic relations
unless she abandon her present meth?
ods of submarine warfare, and imme?
diately declares her intention to do
so, was delivered today in a note
to Berlin and was announced by the
President in an address to a joint
session of Congress. The President
demands nothing less than the aban?
donment of submarine warfare
against commerce.
Both the President's address and
tho American note declare in une?
quivocal terms that only by Germany
acceding to the demand can the break?
ing off of relations be prevented.
The President considers that the
next step depends solely upon Ger?
many, and that three or four days
constitute a reasonable time for a
reply. He is willing to discuss how
submarine warfare may be conducted
within the limits of international law
and humanity after Germany abso?
lutely abandons her present methods.
Diplomatic history records but one
instance as yet where a breaking of
relations between two first-class pow?
ers has not eventually brought war?
that which now exists between Ger?
many and Italy.
President Wilson's words leave no
opportunity for double meaning. In
bis address to Congress, he said:
"I have deemed it my duly to say
to the Imperial German government
that if il is still its purpose to prose?
cute relentless and indiscriminate
warfare * * * the government of the
United States is at last forced to the
conclusion that there is but one
course it can pursue; and that un?
less the imperial German government
should now, immediately, declare and
effect an abandonment of its pres?
ent methods of warfare against pas?
senger and freight carrying vessels
tIiis government can have no choice
but to sever diplomatic relations al?
together."
The note to Berlin declares:
"The government of the United
States has been very patient *****
It has accepted the successive expla?
nations and assurances of the imper?
ial government as of course given in
entire sincerity and good faith, and
has hoped even against hope that it
would prove to be possible for the
imperial government so to order and
control the acts of its naval com?
manders as to square its policy with
the'recognized principles of humanity
as embodied in the law of nations. It
has made every allowance for unprec?
edented conditions and has been will?
ing to wait until the facts became
unmistakable and were susceptible of
only one interpretation.'"
SUFFRAGE SNAPSHOTS.
When every nation is nt peace,
And every government is stable,
When party disagreements cease,
And statesmen all arc wise and able
When the meillcnium is in sight,
Or seems at least not too remote,
Then only women might be right,
To ask to vote.
?Alice Oner Miller in the New York
Tribune.
Equal suffrage is a contest between
the women und the men who are ruled
by reason against the women and
men who are ruled by custom and
prejudice.
Equal suffrage has not caused any
overwhelming moral revolution, but
it has aided moral evolution in a num?
ber of ways.
The fundamental principles of dem?
ocracy is that. What concerns all
should be decided by all who have
enough sense to vote.
A WORD TO THE WISE
Mr. Smith?I want a rest from this I
suffrage talk. I'd give the world to
be without it.
Mrs. Smith?Keep the world but
give us the vote and not a lisp will
you hear about it.
Did you ever consider the harsh
injustice of sneering at women's lack
of political knowledge and then re?
fusing her the opportunity of ac?
quiring such knowledge?
Children should be Uiught by moth?
ers who have developed civic knowl?
edge and civic science.
Equal suffrage benefits tho home by
giving the home-maker equal power
with the breadwinner to elect the
lawmakers whose laws effect the home
aa well as business life. Men need
the ballot to advance their business
interest, women to protect the home.
The privilege of persuading a poli?
tician is never worth as much as the
power to command him. Another rea?
son why women should have the bal?
lot.

AMERICAN HORSES POR WAR.
(Breeder's- Gazette.)
"The present European war has re?
peated the dependence of foreign
countries on the horse supply of the
United States. Prom our 23,000,000
horses we have been advantaged by
shipping already 521,000. Even this
may not have convinced imprncticnl
theorists that without our so-called
government breeding we may not
supply for our own service as many
as 2,000 annual remounts.
"Our horses accepted by foreign
countries hnve been no better than
the poor mounts of tho United States
cavalry. The best that hove been
taken have been for Hold artillery,
and mnny good mares have gone
away, and in many instances because
of the governments breeding menace
to our farmers and their discour
agment on account of the wholly in?
adequate prices paid them by the
United States government.
"It is well that we bear in mind
that the destruction of horses in the
impending struggle between men and
the attendant interruption of horse
breeding in Europe compel not only
continued immediate demand for the
American horses, but assures active
ultimate market for the best horses
that you can produce. These consid?
erations suggest that we retain our
choicest mares and breed along lines
that experience has proved to be wise.
UNITED STATES ARMY TO
BUY HORSES.
It is announced that" the ? United

TAZEWELL, VII
DEFEAT SLEMP
Democrats in the Ninth Casting
About For Man to "Clean Up"
Lone Congressman?Believ?
ed Buchanan Can Do it
Washington, April 18?Several men
quito prominently connected with
Democratic politics in the Ninth con?
gressional district of Virginia who
have been in Washington in the past
few days are authority for the state?
ment that a Democrat will he decided
on shortly to make the race for con?
gress against Congressman C. Bus
com Slemp, the Republican incumbent.
After the defeat of two years ago
of T?te Irvine, of Big Stone Gap, by
Slump, after quite a hard campaign,
it was thought that no Democrat
would make the contest this year.
Recently, however, the Democrats
of the Ninth, in whose breasts hope
springs eternal, have been discussing
possible candidates with a view to
making another effort to elect a solid
Democratic delegation to congress
from Virginia.
Several names have been mentioned
but it has been thought best to keep
them under cover until some man is
selected upon whom all elements can
agree.
BUCHANAN, THE MAN?
Efforts have been made to influence
former Senator B. P. Buchanan, of
Marion, to make the race. He is
thought by many to be the strongest
man in the district to make such a
race as this. There are almost a
thousand Buchanans in the Ninth dis?
trict, and mighty few of them have
ever voted the Republican ticket.
Mr. Buchanan, who is one of the
most widely known men in the Ninth
district, has already announced him?
self a candidate for lieutenant gov?
ernor. But this would not preclude
his making the raco for congress
should he decide to do so.
He is now holding the position of
counsellor for insolvent national
banks under tho comptroller of the
currency, at n salry of $4,000 per
annum.
He rseigned as senator shortly af?
ter taking that position and was suc?
ceeded by his son.

a lingering illness. He leaves a wife,
but no children.
Mr. Gerald received a wound during
the civil war, which later necessitated
the amputation of one of his legs,

plications, no doubt, shortened his

Tho burial took place on yesterday
in the cemetery at Concord church.

SENATE PASSES ARMY MEAS?
URE CALLING FOR A MILLION
TROOPS.
Washington, April IK.?An army
re-oi gaui/at ion bill that would pro
duce regular army and reserve mill
tary forces in the United Slates ag?
gregating a million men was passed
by the senate tonight without a rec?
ord vote.
In the closing hours of debate the
senate made provision for a regular
standing army with a peace strength
of 250,000 men, as compared with
140,000 in the Hall bill which passed
the house, retained after a close light
the provision for a federal volunteer
army reserve force calculated to ag?
gregate 261,000 men and federalixed
the national guard forces of the
Slates at an estimated strength of
280,000.
In addition lo this combined regu?
lar and reserve force of 700,000 men,
an amendment passed to create a
school and college youths reserve
corps in time of war or threatened
war which would recruit a force of
trained young men, schooled by of?
ficers of the regular army, the esti?
mated strength of which is anywhere
from 200,000 to 400,000.
EASTER.
Next Sunday the churches, in this
country at least, will celebrate the
Resurrection Day of Our Ix>rd._ It
may be, that before the day arrives,
this country will be in a slate of war
with Germany. Already our soldiers
are in hostile arms in Mexico. Nevei
has Ihere been such an Kastor cele?
bration as this one of 1010 now prom?
ises to be. The awful condition of
the Christian world is causing anx?
ious thought among all thoughtful
men. To make next Sunday a day
of display and thoughtless show and
parade, will be wholly incongurous
and out of place.
The most becoming Easter costume
for next Sunday would be sack cloth
with ashes for the covering of our
heads.

"Oh, he was short on ppellin' nnd

for them, but a simplo and easy
thing if each one of our readers will
send us at least one name and ad?
dress. Send as many as you can or
will, but please send one anyhow. We
will pay for this service. A postal
card?only a penny-?will do. Please
grant the favor at your earliest con?

Sunday school meeting. Every school
for miles around will attend. If there
is objection, or anything in the way of
the time and place for holding this

Shawvers AI ills will so notify me. If
no word to the contrary is received

THIS REALLY HAPPENED, MR.
MERCHANT.
"Where did you get that package
from Air. R.-1" asked a town man
th<? other day of a countryman who
had a large package under his arm,
which proved to be a ladies suit from
one of the large mail order houses.
The farmers reply was that his wife
read in one of the mail order catalogs
about this suit, and it was just what
she wanted and ordered it.
"You ought to patronize home in?
dustries," says the town man. The
merchants in this town have the iden?
tical suit, and could save your the
trouble in sending it back if it didn't
fit."
"Well; they have. Wo didn't know
that, or we would have bought from
our town merchants."
Thousands of dollars are being sent
out of town and county nnnually for
good3 that our merchants have, but
J the people don't know it.
