Senator Jamas on Maaiage.
Washington. April !. Senator James
said, discussing the I 'resident" mes
age: "It wa a" strong message. I
deeply regret that it - was. necessary,
but the 1'resldenl has done all that pa
tience and diplomacy could accomplish.
If Germany W ill do tluit which she has
heretofore promised, and do it In good
faith there will be no severance of dip
lomatic relations."
What It Would Mean.

now up to Gornuiny. That being con
ceded, members of Congress arc ask
ing: Should Germany provoke the
break, and one come, what then? How
long before a diplomatic break would
bo changed Into a slate of war? The
answrarlB!
'rTssiHjn a Germany commits such
act or act a to force tbo United States
to declare war."
There la the delicate situation. But
tt l nolnted out. Germany's diplomat
ic relation with Italy were severed
some time ago and Austria, her ally.
Is at war with Italy, yet the broacn Be
tween the latter and Germany ha not
taken on the more erlou character.
In the United State harbori toduy
are $60,000,001) worth of hlp, which
would be seized Immediately should
war bo declared.
Germany need ship, and this would
be on point Which would Influence it

OPERATE IN KENTUCK
AVERAGE NEW PRODUCTION
THREE TIMES THAT OF
LAST YEAR.
IS
Barbourvllle, Ky., April 16. Ken
tucky petroleum developments now In
elude a scope of territory extending
entirely across the State In both direc
tions, from the West YiA'inla border to
the Mississippi River and southward
from the Ohio River counties into Ten
nessee. The revival of the industry,
beginning in thewinter with the ad
vent of the highest prices ever quoted,
has started a search for new producing
territory, which now includes most of
the counties of the State, activity being
evidenced either by new drilling opera
tions or by extensive leasing In prepa
ration for drilling. Drilling rigs in
commission this week numbered fifty
four, or three times the number in op
eration at this time last year. The av
erage new production being developed
each week is more than three times the
average shown at-this season last year,
a duily yield of 700 barrels shown in
the first week this month being a rec
ord. Shallow and districts continue most
active. In new work, Estill and Allen
counties lend, as usual, with u number
of good strikes reported from each
field. Estill county operations have
been retarded by the bud condition of
the roads, preventing the starting of
much proposed work, but with twenty
or more wells drilling, this field con
tinues the center of activity in Ken
tucky. Five strikes are reported for the
week, with a smaller than average ca
pacity. The best of new strikes yield
ed forty barrels. Two hundred new
wells are now In prospect for Estill and
neighboring fields. ' In the bordering
county of Powell some new strikes fur
ther define an extension In that direc
tion. Work Ib getting under good head
way In the lower portion of Madison
county, while new work is proposed for
Clark county. Into which operators hope
to prove an extension of the Estill
county sand.
The older producing areas of Wayne,
Wolfe, Lawrence and Morgan counties
have figured lightly In late return.
Three new completions are reported
from Wayne-co the best yielding fif
teen barrels. In the upper Kentucky
districts the only new production was

WAYNE COUNTY
TEACHERS'
EXAMINATION.
In speaking of the recent teachers .
examination held In Ft. Gay the Wayne' -News
says: . .!
It Is unfortunate that some of the ap
plicant sougnt to use unfair means to
obtain a certificate. First the county
was flooded with questions which prov
ed to be bogus, and the purchasers were
out in round numbers from the county,
so far a we have been able to run
down, more than $200.00. It Is report
ed that the one that got up thl set has
left the county and tate. The real
questions were circulated and a num
ber were caught with them and they
will be dealt with by the state authori
ties. It ia thought that probably some,
twenty-five applicants' grades will be
withheld. The real questions were
brought into this county from another
county and a full and complete Investi
gation will be made In that county.

JOHN W. LANGLEY IN DANGER.
: Washington, April 10. The confus

to choose a Presidential nominee 1
amusingly illustrated in the case of
Representative John W. Langley, of
Kentucky, a delegate at large to the
Republican National Convention. - As
delegates at large Mr. Langley was inJ
structed for Charles W. Fairbanks. A
week ago he said he waa working for
Justice Hughes, and now he Is going to
visit Colonel Roosevelt at Oyster Bay.
At least he has been invited to do so,
and probably will accept.
Mr. Langley's friends Just now are
uncertain whom he will ultimately sup
port. His statement a week ago that in '
spite of his Instructions he was work
ing for Mr. Hughes was made with
permission to publish it. Since then
the possibilities -.of his trip to Oyster
Bay seem further to have unsettled
him. -...'.
