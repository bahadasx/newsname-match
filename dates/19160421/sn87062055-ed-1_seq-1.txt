NORMAL'S THIRD ANNUAL
ORATORICAL CONTEST
The Northern Arizona Normal school
will hold its third annual oratorical
contest on Saturday evening, April
22, 1916. There are to be six con
testants and it promises to be one of
the best contests ever held at the
Normal school.
The contestants have expended
much time upon their orations and
they have been very efficiently coach
ed. A number of them have appeared
before and a very pleasing program
is looked forward to. To those who
heard the orations at the time of the
society contest, and on other occa
sions too, will welcome again the
opportunity to hear the Normal
school's fine orators. Mr., and Mrs.
Tom Pollock have very generously
offered $20. n prizes to the winners of
the contest. The subjects are of a
wide and varied interest, and are as
follows:
Religion and Morality Victor
Stoner.
True Greatness Kathleen Ander
son. Appreciation Claire Campbell.
Eugenics Leon Jones.
The Slums Jeanctte Dupuis.
Fusion of Progress and Ideals
Madeline Brandt.
It can easily be seen that the pro
gram covers a wide range of subjects
and a pleasant evening is assured all
who attend this interesting contest,
on Saturday evening, at 7:30 o'clock.
The small admission of 15 cents
will be charged to defray the few
necessary expenses.
Noted Writer Returns to Flagstaff
Porter Emerson Brown, the noted
writer returned last week from his
trip into the Indian country with Al
Doyle and left Sunday for Chicago.
Mr. Brown was given a short joy ride
by James Swinnerton, to the Cliff
Dwellings and other points of inter
est during his brief stay in Flagstaff.
Mr. Brown says he enjoyed every mo
ment of the trip including Al's famous
buiscuit; Rimmy Jim Gcddings' tales
of triaisTonthe range in bringing up
calves and the Indians. This was his
first trip west and in the new en
vironment, he accumulated fresh ideas
of the great "out-door country."
where even yet the stranger is met
with: "Git down, stranger and come
in. Have yu' ct yet?"
A Lively Altercation
An altercation between L. N. Good
ding and E. T. McGonigle at the Nor
mal Monday morning, resulted in a
rough and tumble affair in which a
gun in the possession of Goodding
was accidently discharged. Goodding
claims that he was ordered from the
grounds by a foreman which was
later taken up by McGonigle, result
ing in the fight. Goodding was ar
rested charged with carrying con
cealed weapons and was fined $20 and
given a thirty day suspended sen
tence. There has been much bad feeling
since the charges made by Goodding
that worthless material was being
used in building the new dormitories,
over which McGonigle has supervi
sion. Lamp Post Was De-Lighted
The team on L. E. Johnson's milk
delivery wagon became frightened
Saturday morning at something and
endeavored to make a quick delivery
of all the milk in the wagon. They
narrowly missed the lamp post on one
corner of the street but succeeded in
gathering up the other one root and
branch; from there they went across
to the other side of Railroad avenue,
where they wero stopped. Very little
damage was done the wagon, but
there is a vacancy in our "great
white way" system.
A Goodly Supply of Booze Captured
About fifteen gallons of whiskey
was captured by Undersheriff Frank
Dickinson Wednesday. It was in the
possession of Frank Kuhn who
claims the whiskey and says it was
for personal use. It was said to have
been shipped in by express in trunks
and consisted of a couple cases of
pint bottles and two jugs. The stuff
is being held as evidense and Kuhn
is also held as an exhibit until the
question of "personal use," sale
barter is proven or not proven.
or
Utah Wool Selling High
M. I. Powers received the following
telegram yesterday from Salt Lake
City, relative to the selling price of
wool in that section of the country:
"Million pounds of Rexburg cross
bred sold at 30 cents; 314 cents
freely offered for Cokcsville wools,
buyers very active this week.
S. W. McCLURE."
GRAND CANYON NEWS NOTES
Mr. and Mrs. George L. Colton
were called to Prescott last Thurs
day by the death of Mrs. Colton's
father.
M. H. Wilson, of the El Tovar
office staff, returned from a flying
trip to Los Angeles, where he was
called by the serious illness of his
father, who is now somewhat better.
Mrs. C. A. Brandt returned
late
last week, after a visit of over a
month in California. Her time was
spent mostly in Los Angeles, and
Long Beach, where she was visiting
friends.
Barney Oldfleld, the well known
racing driver, dropped in for n few
minutes last Saturday. He was on
his way east, and was in a hurry to
get to Flagstaff, so his stop here was
cut short.
A party of twenty-odd ladies com
prising the leading workers in the
woman's suffrage cause, arrived at
the Canyon Tuesday night. At eight
o'clock a mass meeting was held, and
a large audience heard a number of
speeches of the envoys, who have a
large movement under way leading to
the enaction of a national amend
ment enfranchising women. This
party started from Washington, D.
C. and their route covers practically
all the west and northwest as far as
Seattle.
A preliminary hearing in the case
of the State vs. Wm. Pey ct al was
held in Justice Ferrell's court Tues
day morning. This case arose over
the alleged illegal killing of some
beef by the defendants named. Judge
Fcrrall bound the defendants over to
await the action of the grand jury,
with a bond of $1500.00 each. Arthur
Blower furnished the necessary
amount and was released, while Wm.
Pey and Geo. Mognett failing to give
bonds were taken to Flagstaff, in the
custody of Deputy Sheriff Eakins.
ULTIMATUM IS SENT . .
GERMANJOVERNMENT
Washington, April 19. America's
note to Germany, made public here
late today, says:
"Unless the imperial government
should now immediately declare and
effect an abandonment of its present
methods of submarine warfare
against passenger and freight carry
ing vessels, the government of the
United States can have no choice but
to sever diplomatic relations with the
German empire altogether."
"If," says the note, "it is still the
purpose of the imperial government
to prosecute relentless and indiscrim
inate warfare against vessels of com
merce by the use of submarines with'
out regard to what the government
of the United States must consider
the sacred and indisputable rules of
international law and the universally
recognized dictates of humanity, the
government of the United States is at
last forced to the conclusion that
there is but one course it can pursue."
The note asserts that information
in the posession of the United States
establishes conclusively that the
channel steamer Sussex was torpe
doed without warning anU that the
torpedo was of German manui'ici,,rc.
The conclusion that the torpedo was
fired by a German submarine, it adds,
is considered substantiated by Ger
many's disclaimer.
The note declares if the Sussex had
been an isolated case the United
States might regard it as possible to
hope that the officer responsible had
been neglegent or violated his orders,
but that unhappily this terrible ex
ample of submarine warfare does not
stand alone.
Germany is informed that the Unit
ed States gained the impression from
her recent communication that the
imperial government failed to appre
ciate tho gravity of the situation
"which has resulted not alone from
the attack on the Sussex, but from
the whole method and character of
submarine warfare, as disclosed by
the unrestrained practice of the com
manders of German undersea craft
during the past twelve months and
more in the indiscriminate destruc
tion of merchant vessels of all sorts,
nationalities and destinations."
An appendix to the note which
deals entirely with an analysis of the
facts found in the Sussex case dis
closes that American army and navy
officers found in the. Sussex screw
bolts which corresponded with those
found on German torpedoes in pos
session of the French naval authori
ties at Toulon. The screw bolts are
used to fasten the "war head" to the
air chamber.
TOM CAMPBELL SAYS IT
IS A REPUBLICAN YEAR
Tom Campbell, one of the most
prominently mentioned candidates for
the republican nomination for gover
nor, was in the city a couple days
this week on business connected with
his duties as tax commissioner. While
Tom is a tentative candidate for the
place, he has made no announcement
of the fact and insists that if the
party seem to think he is the man tq
make the race, he is willing to go,
but is not seeking the place with any
entanglements.
"I have been pretty much all over
the state during the past month,"
said Mr. Campbell, "and am thor
oughly convinced that this is a re
publican year, both in the state and
tho nation. This seems not only to
be the sentiment of republicans, but
people in general, including many
former stalwart democrats. The lines
are very clearly drawn; the people
are thinking deeply on existing con
ditions and in my judgment, they are
coming to conclusion that will place
the blame where it rightfully be
longs." A Peculating Printer
Fred Vancourt, a traveling print
er, was arrested here Monday by
Sheriff Dickinson, charged with hav
ing stolen a couple of numbering
machines from the Nugget office at
Needles. Vancourt was evidently a
booze fighter and when he quit his
job at Needles gathered up a couple
of the new numbering machines to
keep tab on himself with. He ack
nowledged his guilt and said he
would go back to Needles and face
the charges without the necessity of
extradiction papers.
A Navajo Does Spectacular Stunt
A Navajo Indian teamster pulled
off a spectacular rough-riding stunt
Monday afternoon on Birch avenue.
His team, which he had evidently
i started to hook on ahead of another
team pulling a load out of the alley
behindBabbitt's new garage, started
to run away with him dragging the
whifiletrecs; he held onto the lines
and run for a short distance then
seated himself on his Levi Straus's
with his feet out in front of him and
slid a full block before he struck a
bumpy place in the road and capsized.
His overalls did not seem to be much
the worse for wear and the Indian
started out on a run for his horses.
They were headed back to the reser
vation but were caught a short dis
tance from town.
Remotes Sister's Remains to San
Francisco
The body of Mrs. Ann McDonald
McNeil was exhumed last Tuesday
and taken to San Francisco for burial
by her sister Mrs. Kitty Gordon. Mrs.
McNeil died on the train at Angel,
Nov. 4th, 1911, while on her way
from Scotland to San Francisco. Her
sister Mrs. Gordon and daughter,
Miss Kitty McNeil were with her at
the time of her death and brought
the remains to Flagstaff for inter
ment. Mrs. Gordon could hardly ex
press sufficient thanks to the people
of Flagstaff who were so kind to her
in her trouble at the time of her
sister's death and in her sad task of
removing the remains to San Fran
cisco. TWP TRUNK-LUGGERS
CAPTURED AT WILLIAMS
Two strange colored gentlemen
were arrested at Williams Wednesday
for having too much whiskey in their
possession. It was claimed that they
brought in thirty six quarts in a
couple trunks from Needles Saturday.
When the stuff was captured they
had twelve quarts left. The balance
of the thirty six quarts, they claim
were stolen from them in transit and
the balance of the quarts missing,
twelve in number, they had used for
personal use bctwen Saturday night
and Monday morning. Deputy Sher
iff Maurice Smith, who brought them
in to the county jail yesterday,
seemed to think that the amount of
booze they claim to have used in so
short a time would have produced
very much more affect on them than
their appearance indicated.
J. H. Morgan, who has been down
south for the winter came up Tues
day with a couple car loads of horses
and will again endeavor to raise a
prize crop on his ranch near Maine.
Conductor L. M. Hopkins, of Need
les, laid off a couple trips tho first of
the week in order to visit Flagstaff.
He is interested in a rich mining
property at Oaman the Gold Road
Annex, which has been examined by
a nrominent exnert who made a most
favorable report.
RECLAMATION SERVICE
INVESTIGATING WATER
f That the government is taking an
active interest in the development of
-lands throughout the country, is
evidenced by the fact that an ex
haustive investigation of conditions
is being made. Mr. C. T. Byrd, an
attorney for the U. S. reclamation
service has been n Flagstaff the past
week looking up the records of water
locations. Their uses and purposes
are to be considered in connection
with the work the government pro
poses doing on the Colorado river and
us tributaries in the way of building
reservoirs to conserve the flood
waters of the streams thus prevent
ing much of the annual damage done
by floods. The investigation takes in
Ke states of AriVcna, Nov Mexico,
Vaiuornia, Wyoming, Utah and a
p&rtion of Nevada.
Mr. Bjrd has been strenuously en
deavoring to call the attention of the
people of Arizona to the vast waste
that is made by people in appropriat
ing great quantities of water which
they can not possibly use and which
shuts off others who might make use
of it. He says the laws of the state
oif the water question need a radical
revision along this line. Under exist
ing conditions water appropriations
may be made, not used, then re-located
before the time expires in which
the' necessary development work
should be done. He strongly believes
that it would be to the best interest
of all concerned if the government
could take over many of the projects
now being carried on or attempted
to be carried on by local people; the
government could afford to put them
in; shape to bring about the best re
sults while individuals and smaller
companies usually have to struggle
along with very indifferent results.
.Sir. Boyd says that he has found
over 1,300 water locations in Coco
nino county, most people here have
had no idea that any such number of
claims had been filed. He suggests
that the legislature should look into
'he matter at the next session and
i pass some law that will protect the
i developer against the man who has
a prior right filed but with no inten-
. tion of using it.
Phil Rickcl for City Marshal
Phil Rickel announces himself in
this, issue of the Sun as a candidate
for the office of City Marshal. This
is his first attempt in the political
line, though he has been a resident of
Flagstaff for a good many years and
has a large number of friends who
are confident that he would make a
good officer. Flagstaff is growing
rapidly and the duties of the office of
City Marshal require a man who is
energetic and willing to look after
the interests of the people of all
classes, at all hours, which Phil
promises will be one of his duties
should the people decide at the com
ing election in his favor. He wants
the job, is willing to admit it public
ally and has many supporters who be
lieve firmly that he will land it.
Southern Editor Visits Flag
Allen B. Jaynes, editor of the Tuc
son Citizen, came in last evening
from the south to remain over until
this morning. Jaynes runs the best
and livest daily paper in the southern
part of the state, which recently put
in the full Associated Press report
for his paper in order that it should
completely cover the news field
that part of the country.

LADIES'
OPERETTA
A BIG ATTRACTION
The operetta to be given next Tues
day night at the Emerson school by
the Music department of the Woman's
Club, promises well of being one of
the best entertainments of the season.
From all that has been heard and said
of the operetta, Miss Eva Mae Hope
of Chicago, Miss Miffin's class in
athletic and Mrs. Carew's troubles
will furnish amusement galore, aside
from the musical program prepared
for the occasion. As usual the enter
tainment is given in a good cause and
with good talent. You had better see
about tickets before your wife dis
covers your neglect. '
New Weatherford Theatre Building
Started
Construction work on the new thea
tre building on the ground formerly
occupied by the Majestic, is now un
der way and is being supervised by

BARNEY 0L0FIEL0 GOES

On a trip over the Santa Fe Trail
to Chicago, Barney Oldfield, veteran

during the trip. The party expects I
to reach Chicago about May 1st.
For Street Superintendent Joe Mo
ritz Joseph Moritz, the man who has
put in two strenuous years as the city
street commissioner for the city of
Flagstaff, again announces himself as
a candidate for that most important
office. Mr. Moritz has been on the
job from the time that he was elected
to the present time, giving his whole
time and energy to the job. There
have been many tangles in the work
during his administration, and an al
most complete change in affairs so
far as the handling of the streets arc
concerned. New streets, new grades,
new work of all kinds which necessi
tated more than ordinary labor and
time in caring for. The city has
spread out in all directions during his
administraton with but meagre funds
to care for the many new streets, but
he has given his best efforts toward
making the best streets possible under
the circumstances. During the past
winter he saved much property from
damage by personally getting into
the trenches himself and assisting in
cutting out waterways through the
deep snows, aid breaking through
deep snows.
The coming year will more than
ever need the services of one who will
devote his whole time and energy to
the office, if half the work contem
plated in the way of improvements is
carried through.
Villa Death All a Fake
The reported death of Villa is all
a fake, so reports General Pershing.
The story was concocted at Juarez
and was a lie pure and simple for the
purpose of aiding Villa in his escape
and to get thd American troops out
of Mexico. Some of the "stuff" that
comes out of El Paso and border
towns is a disgrace to American
newspapers.
MANY ANXIOUS TO START
PAVINGJT EARLY DATE
J. D. Morton, of Phoenix, repre
senting the California-Arizona Con
struction Co., with E. Power Conway
also of Phoenix, were in Flagstaff
Wednesday looking up the paving
proposition.
It has been suggested by them, that
in order to hurry matters alon, prop
erty owners could sign up a contract
for their part of the paving and work
could commence much earlier than by
waiting for the full time required by
the notice of intention printed in this
issue of The Sun.
'ver cig'ity p nt of the proper
ty owners are in favor of the paving
and would willingly sign such a con
tract and those who do not may be
compelled to ,do their share after the
full legal proceedings have been gone
through with.
An active effort is being made to
get as many as possible to enter into
contract now in order to let the good
work go on thus reaping the benefit
of the good weather, as the season
for doing good cement work is short
enough here at best.
' A Little Gun War at Winslow
It was reported that a one sided
small war broke out in Winslow Sat
urday night, in which a carpenter
named Scribner fired five shots at
j Nic Dovas, a contractor. None of the
shots took affect, though one bullet
took a hunk out of Dovas shirt,
i Scribner then secured an auto of
I Leon Smith telling him he wanted to
go out to the round house. When out
I a short distance, Scribner poked his
Pun up against Smith and told him
l to make the old machine go as far'as
it would go. Smith claimed that he
on'y had a gallon of gasoline in the
tank and would have to go back to
town and get more; Scribner gave
him $2.00 and told him if he did not

The row started over a settlement
between him and Dovas.

Mormon Lake Covers the County
Road
"Tom" Drum came up from Stone
mans Lake Tuesday, having returned
from Gilbert, Arizona, where he and
Mrs. Drum spent the winter.
Mr. Drum says that the Mormon
lake road has been completly put out
of commission by high water. The
water covers the road all along the
lake and can not be used. He came
in around by the southwest side of
the lake where there is a reasonably
good road and could be made a good
one if taken care of by the county.
Up to His Old Tricks
David Babbitt, of Flagstaff, and of
the popular firm of Babbitt Bros,
known so well in the northern part
of the state, was in town the first of
the week on a business trip. Wins
low Mail.
Since Mr. David Babbitt is in Los
Angeles and Dr. E. S. Miller was in
Winslow at this time, it would seem
that the doctor was up to his old
tricks or maybe the reporter was
mistaken as are hundreds of other
people.
Bronc Motorcycle Runs Away
Lester Power was thoroughly and ,
completely ditched by a broncho
motorcycle last Sunday afternoon out
at the driving park and was quite
seriously bruised and cut up, though
no bones were broken. He was try
ing the machine around the race
track, going at about a twenty mile
clip, when the dingbat, or whatever
you call it that turns on the juice,
broke and started the machine off
at top speed. He attempted to hit a
straight road but failed and run into
some rocks, then turned and made a
complete turn over into river de
Flag where there was considerable
water.
