Neither John S. Si'jinour nor his

lug that tho person who ordered the
eavesdropping would be proscu
both by his llrm and bV the agents of

There is a faction among the convicts

"But remember," said the Germin

the interview, "that we have no de

hall not bring it about, despite our
desire to push vinorously our subma- 1

"Wo have definitely agreed to

WASHINGTON ANXIOUS
FOR EARLY SETTLEMENT
lil.KI.IN, April 21. I'resiilcnt Wilson's demand that Germany
abandon her jirjicm Mibinarine method tinder penalty of a diplomatic
break was conveyed to-day to the Kniwr and the people of Germany.
'I he text 0! the note was telegraphed .to-Rraud-atmy headquarters
for the l.inperor'b immediate perusal. Several hours later it was circu
lated throughout Germany hy the official news agency for publication
in to-da)'s papers
The obsiche .citiing remarked editorially that Germany will
make .1 further examination ol the data in the Sussex case. The news
papers dUpl.u piumiiieittly e.a'rpls Horn a Chicago newspaper editorial
declaring il opposition to war witli Germany on the submarine issue.
Hccause to-day is Good l-'riday it is practically impossible to obtain
.111 ulficial expression from the Rwign Uflice. It is indicated that no
comment would Iv made until Chancellor von Hcthmann-llollweg re
turns troni hi l:ister viMt to the Kaicr. probably on Monday.
'I here is little likelihood that any reply will be s!iil to Washington
before the end ol next week. .Since the submarine controversies with
America began it ha been cu.-tmiiar to Munition into conference heads
of the marine department and leading bankers and ihimiuAs men before
a reply was sent to Washington. It is probable that this cour.s: will again
be followed, and that in addition leading members ol the Reichstag will
be imbed to express their ieu.
