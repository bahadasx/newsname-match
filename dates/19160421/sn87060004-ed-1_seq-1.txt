WILSON
DEMANDS
GERMANY
RESPECT
Neutral Rights in- Vote to
Kaiser and in Speech Be
for Congress.'
THIS MAYJEAN WAR
Washington, April to. President
Wilson's long expected final warning
td Germany that the United States
will break off diplomatic relations
unless she abandons her present meth
odi of submarine wartare and im
mediately declares her intention to do
so, was delivered today in a note to
Berlin and was announced by the
President in a joint session to Con
gress The President demands noth.
ing less than the abandonment of
submarine warfare against commerce.
Both the President's address and
the American note declare in unequi
vocal terms that only by Germany
acceding to the demand can the break
ing off of relations altogether be pre
vented. . The President considers that the
exf'step depends solely upon Ger
many' and thai three or four days
constitute-a.reasonable time for a re
ply He is willing to discuss, how
submarine warfare may be conducted
within the limits of international law
and'fiumanity after Germany aban
donsher present methods.
Diplomatic history records but one
'instance as yet" where a breaking of
iatfons between two first class pow
ersihas not eventually brought war
that which now exists between Ger
many and Italy.
President Wilson';, words leave no
-opportunity for double meaning. In
his address to Congress he said:
"I have deemed it my duty to say
to thcimperial German government
that if it is still its purpose to prose
cute relentless and indiscriminate war
the Government of the United States
is at last forced to the conclusion that
there is but one source it can pursue;
and that unless the imperial German
government should now, immediately
declare 'and effect an abandonment of
its present methods of warfare against
-passenger and freight carrying vessels
this Government can htve no choice
ibut to sever diplomatic relations al
together."

IN CONTEST
Miss Francis Elgin of Madi

and Comes to the
Front
OTHERS MAKE LARGE GAINS
Miss Francis Elgin, .of Madison

some votes to spare. Mrs. E.K.Ham
er of this city is second, Miss Bradie
Dame of Nebo third, Miss Katie
Olark of Nortonville fourth, Miss
Blanch Leisure of llsley fifth, Miss
Mona Faull of St. Charles sixth
That is the way they stand today hut
look out for some big .changes next
Friday. One of the contestants told
us that she had secured six people to
go on the trip and was going to make
them pay the 920.00 in advance so
she could get the 300,000 votes that
would give her. This is a good idea,
you know we give you 50,000 votes
for each party you secure on the trip
and who pay the $20.00, why not
get your parties to pay you now so
you can have the 50,000 votes to
use when you pleased. We have the
round trip tickets for sale in
this office and contestants may have
a supply of same by calling here for
them. It looks now like we would
have something like 75 or more in
the bunch and we can promise them
the best trip we have ever undertak
en. There will be a string band on
the boat both going and returning
and also a soft drink stand with all
kinds of cooling and refreshing
drinks. The steamer we take from
Evansrille is in charge of Capt. Will
Williams and he says there will be
nothing left undone for the pleasure
and comfort of the Bee's pirty. Get
busy and pile up the votes, ask every
one you see for a dollar for the Karl
ington Bee, ask your friends to help
you, get some pep in you ind wake
up, you can win hands down if you
keep at it an4 don't get discouraged.

When you feel billious, slug

remember that your druggist
sells for 50 ceuts a large bottle of
