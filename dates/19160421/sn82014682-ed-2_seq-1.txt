WASHINGTON, D. C, : April
21. A possibility that the immigra
tion oili may be opposed by the
president because of the 'Asiatic ex
.elusion features is developing in the
- capital now. : ;. ,' : :
-; Viscount Chinda, the Japanese
ambassador, conferred today with
President Wilson over the provision
in the pending immigration bill
which proposes to enact into law
the so-called gentlemen s agree
ment by -which : Japan now re
stricts her laborers from coming to
.the-United States. A memoran
dum embodvinz the objections of
Japan to this feature of the bill was
filed by Ambassador Chinda.
v It is understood that other pro
posed! features of. the bill dealing
with IVsiatic exclusion have been
found objectionable by Japan.1 The
bill has passed the house and been
favorably reported to the senate,
carrying the Asiatic exclusion prof
visions. , '. "

tion is understood to be a cUsinclin
