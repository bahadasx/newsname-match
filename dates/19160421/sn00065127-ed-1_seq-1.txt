Attracting Birds about the Home.
To the mind of the average person
birds and trees are naturally associated
and ID is probable that this is one
reason why we celebrate Bird and
Arbor Day tvgeUier. To those who
have studied the habits of birds it is
easily apparent that there are other
things necessary aside from trees in
order that birds may be attracted.
Plenty of water In which to bathe
and drinking water at all times is
equally as important as nesting sites.
This being the case the towns and
cities along the Sioux Iiiver are
especially favored for the banks of
this stream are fairly well wooded and
water is at all times plentiful in the
stream itself. In addition the cities
and towns in Eastern South Dakota
are well supplied with shade trees.
The first) requisite to attracting
birds is a place lor them to nest. The
birds that nest in the open some
distance from the ground like the
Robin, Wood Thrush, Oriole and King
bird always Had nast sites alcng the
Sioux River. The same is true to a
certain extent also with such species
as the Catbird, Thrasher, and Yellow
Warbler which nest In the open, close
to the ground, but many times these
species have to have special plantings
or a pile of brush before they can find
suitable places to nest. A clump of
wild Gooseberry bushes in time forms
and ideal nest site for Brown Thrash
ers and a fairly good one for Catbirds
while both species will frequently
nest in a pile of brush. Tame Rasp
berry bushes appear to make a good
place for the Yellow Warbler. There
is however another class of birds that
Otlglnally nested in holes in trees for
Irnich «special preparation is almost
essential before they will nest in your
door yard. This class includes such
beautiful and valuable species as the
Martin, Blue Bird, Tree Swallow and
Wren. For these birds boxes must be
put up and some of the varieties are
very particular as to the kind of box,
its height, and position, but a single
pair of any of these birds in the yard
in summer amply repays the trouble
caused in putting up suitable boxes-
The places to nest being provided

amount of water that will be used on
a hot day is almost unbelievable One

follow barely enough to wet their
feathers. On such days the supply
should be constantly replenished or
else running water should be provided.
After nest sites and water comes
the destruction of bird enemies That
graceless alien the English Sparrow
comes tiist 011 this list and it should
be given no quarter at any time of
the year. Trapping is an excellent
means of reducing the numbers of
these pests, the wire trap recommend
ed by the U. S. Government being an
excellent one. The writer has mainly
by the use of one of these traps, killed
over four hundred of these bird
enemies since March, 1914. A pocket
net attached to a long pole can be
placed over a nest box opening after
the sparrow is in the box at night and
a few taps on the tree sends the
sparrow into it. Many other good
devises are used to exterminate these
pests. Cats destroy hundreds of young
birds annually and also many grown
birds. E. H. Forbush estimates that
each cat on the average destroys each
year about fifty song birds. It is a
mercy to the cat as well as to the
birds to destroy painlessly a homeless
cat, while many a household pet
deserves the same fate. At least a
pet cat should be shut UD during the
time youny birds are in the nest. A
gentleman recently told the writer
that he saw his house cat with five
struggling young birds in its mouth
at one time. He did not know what
kind they were and the wish was ex
pressed that they were English Spar
rows, but suspicious circumstances
point to the indication that they were
Yellow Warblers. Squirrels also du
great damage to young birds and eggs
as do also Jays, Crows, and Urackles.
Boys, old and young, do considerable
damage, but happily education is
rapidly rectifying this condition of
affairs. A few lectures each year like
that given recently by Dr. Thorns of
the State University to the 1500 pupils
of the Sioux Falls public schools will
accomplish more than all the laws
and ordinances that can be passed.
So give the birds their places to
build ani plenty of water and rid
your premises of their enemies and
the birds will come to you. Wrens
are easily attracted and if ybu get a
pair of Bluebirds you are to be con
gratulated. They may not like your
houses and may sometimes do very
unexpected things. On March 18th,
of this year a pair of Blue birds came
to the writer's boxes and examined

Young Man Having Relatives Here
Meets Death On The Foreign
Battle Field.
The following taken from a Canad
ian paper of recent date Is about the
young relative of Mr. and Mrs. John
Both well from whom we published a
letter a few weeks ago:
"Pte. Allster Munru Mackenzie,
Muskoka, Ont., killed in action."
These cold, official terms in yester
day's casualty list tell of the passing
away of one of Canada's greatest
athletes and a death for which the
members of the Toronto Canoe Club
for 1910-11, 191314, and the single
blade sculling champion of Canada
for 1910 11. lie enlisted in Toronto
with the machine gun section of the
19th Battalion, second contingent,
and the announcement of his death
came as a distinct shock to' his host
of friends.
Allster Mackenzie tf&s born near
Lake Joseph, Muskoka, about 28 years
ago. Here in his early life he made a
prominent name for himself as a
paddler, swimmer and wrestler.
Mackenzie became so proücenü with
the blades that the committees in
charge of the regattas in which he
competed, were often forced to ask
him to withdraw his entry.
Five years ago Mackenzie came to
Toronto to attend the School of Sci
ence. Here he at once became popu
lar and prominent as an athlete.
While at Varsity Mackenzie held the
intercollegiate championship medal
as a wrestler in the welter and heavy
weight classes. Almost four years
ago Mackenzie joined the Toronto
Canoe Club and added greatly to the
power of that club in sculling events.
In his first race he won the Dominion
single-blade championship. He added
to his laurels when, wlthO. A. Elliott
(also with the 19th Battalion machine
gun section), he was one of the win
ners In the tandem championship of
Canada. Elliott and Mackenzie were
the holders of this prize for several
years.
When the call came for volunteers
Mackenzie was engaged in the build
ing Business. While on a visit to his
home in Muskoka a number of friends
who had joined the 19th Battalion
sent a message to him to join them.
Within two days Mackenzie was in
Toronto and donned the khaki with
Elliott.
Writing to friends in Toronto, El
liott told of one of the experiences
Mackenzie had engaged in. He was
one of three men selected by his officer
to make a visit to the German
trenches. The four men set out on
their journey and soon found them
selves separated by a flood from the
battalion. They traveled a consider
able distance safely and as a result
of the trip the officer in command was
given the D. S. O. For his part
Mackenzie was granted an extra seven
days' leave in England.

the ear was entirely removed. The
scar healed over nicely and it was
thought for a time that a cure had
been accomplished, but as is the
nature of a cancer, it broke out again
from some of the tiny rootlets- the
knife had failed to remove. Then

general treatment to get the poison
out of the system, but it gradually

been years of great pain and suffering

"He should have been decorated,
too," said his friend.
No details have been received as to
how Mackenzie came to his death.
He was a powerful physique and his
quiet unassuming nature made him
beloved by all who knew him. "You
cannot say anything too good for
Allster Mackenzie," said one of his
friends when acquainted of the padd
ler's death.
He is survived by his mother, who
lives in Muskoka, a sister and a
brother, who Is now at the front on
active service.
