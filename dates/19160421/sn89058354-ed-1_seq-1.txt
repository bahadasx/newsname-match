REQUIRED OF ALL
Sherrill Writes In Regard To
Those Teaching High
School Subjects
TO DEMAND THAT LAW BE
CARRIED OUT NEXT TERM
County Superintendent Routon
Receives Communication
From State Official
Hereafter, that is becinnini?
with the next term, teachers of
the state who do not hold high
school certificates, will not, un
der any circumstances, be per
mitted to teach any high school
subjects. This statement is con
tained in a letter received this
morning by County Superintend
ent Joe Routon from S. W. Sher
rill, the state superintendent
The letter, which is self explana
tory, is as follows;
"To County Superintendents:
"From information received
from the different counties of the
State, I am led to know that
there are teachers teaching sub-,
jects of the high school course
for which they do not hold cer
tificates. I know that in some
counties teachers are teaching
these high school subjects when
they hold only an elementary
certificate. In other counties,
teachers with certificates for
only one group of the high school
work are teaching subjects not
included in that group. This
not in keeping with the law for
the certificate given the holder
reads 'the person to whom this
certificate is issued is licensed to
teach the subjects against which
grades are marked and no other.'
"It is not my purpose to dis
turb the work now in progress,
but beginning with the next
tchool term, no teacher must be
employed to teach subjects for
which he does not hold a certifi
cate and no trustee must honor
warrants issued to teachers who
do not hold certificates as . pre-
scribed by law. Trustees paying-, I
such warrrnts will be held
responsible for the money thus 1
paid out. Please inform all your i
high school teachers so they can " A
take the examination in others
groups if they wish.
"The next state examination
for teachers will be held May
30-31, at which time an examina- (
tion will be held in all the ele- ...
mentarv subjects and all of the
grades of the high school course,
including reading circle in both
elementary and high school.
"Please urge all your teachers
to take the May examination in-order
that they may have certifi
cates in time to begin their
schools in July.
"Very truly yours,
"S. W. Sherrill." J
TO HOLD NO TEACHERS '
ASSOCIATION THIS TIME
County Superintendent Joe
Routon announces that because
of the school rally to be held
Paris next Friday there will
no Teachers Association this
month. All teachers in the
county are urged to attend the
rally here, however.
