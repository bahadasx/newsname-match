City Council Takes Action Against
Game Tables in Laclede
The new city government is now
fully installed and judging from
the business transacted at the first
meeting is in fine working order.
The new board organized by the
election of J. H. Nichols as presi
dent. Mayor Allen made the fol
lowing appointments: Clerk and
attorney, C. C. Bigger; street
commissioner, A. V. Moore;
treasurer, H. W. Lomax. All ap
pointments were promptly on
firmed by the board. Police Judge
Lomax and Marshal F. R. Power
were duly installed. Judge Lomax
has one of the finest court rooms
in the; county and is ready to dis
charge "the duties of that office
whfinpver called on. At the first
meeting the board unanimous!
passed an ordinance prohibiting
the operation of pool or billiard
hull within the citv limits. The
subject of street and sidewalk im
provement and other important
matters will be definitely acted
upon at the next regular meeting
in May. The board is working in
perfect harmony and good results
are expected.
Street Oiling Again
A meeting was held at the di
rectors' room of the Lomax &
Standly bank last week at which
the suject of street oiling was
taken up and given special at
tention. There were more than
twentv-five present and everyone
was enthusiastically in favor of
oiline again this year and that the
work be started at the earliest
possible time. It is now planned
to oil about twice as many blocks
as was treated last year. To do
this 15,000 gallons of oil , is needed
and the- price is about one-third
WW than last season. To do
this work it will be necessary to
raise a fund of $750 00. About
half the amount was subscribed at
the meeting. Mayor Allen was
elected chairman of the oiling
boosters and he appointed a finan
cial committee composed of H. W.
Lomax, M. P. Benson and A. E
Johnston to solicit the balance o
the funds and report at the next
meeting. . Laclede's experience
with street oiling has been satis
factory beyond all expectations
and everybody wants the good
work to continue,
Brookfield Alarmed
There is nothing that alarms
people as badly as a scourge of
some deadly disease. Brookfield is
very greatly alarmed by the ship
ment of 250 alarm clocks received
by the Strain Jewelry Store. This
alarm is not dangerous except to
the fellow who has to pay the ad
vanced prices that are now made
effective by the factories. Mr.
Strain says "so much brass is used
in Europe to put people to sleep
that there is a scarcity in this
country to wake ns up." "I found
a chance Co get the price of last
year by taking this lot, and belieye
me it didn't take an alarm clock to
wake me up to the opportunity,
bought the clocks and then slep
easy."
O. A. Talbott & Co., have a car
of lumber unloaded that they wil
ne in building a ccal and storage
building 80x50 feet on the site of
their old coal sheds that will be
torn down.
Passing of a Good Man I
John C. Fletcher was born in
Belmont county, Ohio, June 28,
1834, and died at his home in La
clede, April 17,1916, aged 81 years,
9 months and 20 days.
On November 9, 1861, he en;
listed as a defender of our Union
in Company F 15th Ohio Volunteer
Infantry. During the war he was
with his company in five battles
and besides various other engage
ments. In an engagement near
Kenesaw Mountain he was wound
ed. This wound disabled him tor
only a few months. He was honor
ably mustered out at Puleski,
Tennessee, Nov. 9, 1864, having
served three full years.
Mr. Fletcher was married to Miss
Elizabeth Kinney ofl Belmont
county, Ohio. This companion
died in 1859. The deceased came
to Linn county, Missouri, in 1867
and moved to stay in 1869. Since
that time Laclede was his home.
On Sent. 23. 1875. he and Miss
Ellen Brickie of Brookfield, a
native of New York state, were
married in the Protestant Episcopal
church of that city. This was the
first marriage solemnized in that
church edifice. Mrs. Fletcher, to
gether with a large host of friends
mourn the departure of a white
soul.
John C. Fletcher was an in
dustrious man, a valuable citizen,
a good husband, a loyal church
member, and a docile disciple and
faithful follower of Jesus Christ.
In the minds of those who knew
him well there is no doubt that his
prayers, good works, honest labor,
and alms deeds were held in re
membrance, by God. Indeed for
him to live was Christ; to die gain.
The funeral services conducted
by the pastor, Rev. H. J. Dueker,
were held on Wednesday afternoon
in the Methodist Episcopal church
of which society the deceased was
for many years a consistent and
highly esteemed member. The G.
A. R. Post attended the funeral
services in a body. Interment was
made in the Laclede cemetery,
Director J. H. Nichols having
charge.
Card op Thanks
We desire to offer our heartfelt
thanks to all our kind friends for
their thoughtful assistance during
nnr sad bereavement, also for the
beautiful floral offerings.

TWO ARMED ROBBERS
Night Operator Held Up and Depot
Cash Drawer Looted
A bold and successful robbery
was pulled off at the local Burling
ton office early Thursday morning.
About 1 o'clock as Night Operator
W. A, Cutler was working at his
desk two masked men suddenly
entered, one covering the operator
with a revolver while the other
emptied the contents of the cash
drawer into his pocket. Billy
Marlow, a farmer residing south of
town who was in the depot during
the rain, was also made to stick up
his hands. After securing about
$20 from the cash drawer the rob
bers marched Cutler and Marlow
down the track to a point near the
section car house south of the
station where they were searched,
Marlow being relieved of $5.00 and
Cutler of a few cents. The robbers
then disappeared in the darkness.
The alarm was at once given and
the officers were soon at work but
up to the time of going to press no
line had been gotten on them.
Thev made no effort to enter the
express safe or molest anything
else about the station and were
quick about the job. They ap
peared to be young men, perhaps
18 or 20 years of age. No strangers
were noticed about town or the
station that night and they are
supposed to have dropped off a
freight train that passed just before
the robbery.

Harry Maybee, Mr. Fletcher and
Mr. Smith.
The union is going to take up
the work of cleaning some of the
vacant lots and untidy places and
planting flowers instead. This
will be a great help for these deso
late places.
Serving refreshments was unani
mously voted out of the union.
More time will be spent on the
lesson each meeting. It was voted
to organize a Loyal Temperance
Legion for the young people.
Parliamentarian drilled the union
twenty minutes in parliamentary
rules.
The contest is doing well, eight
names being added to the roll.
The institute part of the meeting
was very interesting; all we lacked
was more time.
Guests present were Mrs. Barter,
Mrs. Carothers, Mrs. Benson, Mre.
Dueker, Mrs. Welsh, Miss Marietta
Welsh and Miss Dueker.
