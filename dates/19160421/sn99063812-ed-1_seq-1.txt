Events Leading to Present
German-American Status
February 4, 1915 Germany de
clared that the waters around the
British Isles would be a war sone
after February 18, and announced
that every merchantman found there
in would be torpedoed.
. February 10 The United States
warned Germany that it would be
held to "strict accountability" for
any trenchment on American life or
property.
February 16 Germany replied
that the unfairness of the British
blockade and the necessity of self
preservation would force It to con
tinue its submarine policy.
April 30 The American steamer
Gulfllght was torpedoed and three
killed.
May 1 An advertisement in New
York papers warned Americans not
to travel on the liner Lusitanla.
Mays 7 The Lusitanla was tor
pedoed and sunk and 2,200 drowned,
including 11B Americans.
May 13 -The United States pro
tested, saying it would not "omit any
word or act necessary to Its sacred
duty of maintaining the rights of
citizens."
May 30 Oermany replied that the
Lusitanla was armed and carried mu
nitions. June 8 Secretary of State Bryan

Sixteen Foot OUed Macadam High-

Will Cost About 914,080, Accord
ing to Estimate by Ziuawalt
Crushed Rock Spur Roads WU
Coot Approximately 92,080.
The municipal highway to Bhlp
pington, with branch roads to con
nect with Pelican City, and to go to
the boat landing on Upper Klamath
lake can be built for 120,000, ac
cording to City Engineer Zumwalt.
There has been a story circulated to
the effect that this improvement
would cost twice or three times that
amount.
The ways and means committee ap
pointed by the citizens' mass meet
ing figured the cost at not more than
$20,000. The question on the ballot
at tho May election provides for the
construction of- the road at a cost
not to exceed $20,000.
Zumwalt's estimate, prepared at
the Instance of the campaign com
mittee yesterday, follews:
One and a half miles of five
inch Macadam pavement,
road 16 feet wide, at 81 per
yard 114.000,
One mile crushed rock road,
14 feet wide, with 5-lnch
rock dressing, at '$"per

Total $20,000
When It is considered that the
Klamath Development Co., which
owns all of the rock quarries in that
j section, has agreed to furnish crush-
ted rock as cost, or a saving of from
25 to 75 cents per yard, one can also
figure a material reduction from the
above figures, as tho crushed rock
