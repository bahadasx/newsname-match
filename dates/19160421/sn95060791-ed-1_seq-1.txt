complete.

A small reservoir located on
Water Canyon, just above Eagar,
broke last Wednesday evening
and created considerable excite
ment in the burg. It was feared
that the flood following would
wash away the Water Canyon
ranger station, and much ap
prehension was felt for Mrs
Shelby and her children who
lived there, but the water only
ran in tne nouse a nttie and no
one was injured. An end was
taken out of the rangers' barn
all ot the canal crossings were
wrecked, some fences were torn
down, one county bridge was
washed out and some land was
flooded, but $500 will likely cover
all losses. The reservoir belong
ed to William W. Eagar, George
Eagar and Joseph Rencher. The
same reservoir broke last year,
but had been patched up again.
Mrs, Annie Hall Wiltbank,
wife of Ellis W. WHtbank, and

dermined her health. For two
months past she had been very
ill and gradually gave way until
her death came.
Two pairs of twins are report

Busy Day in Justice Court
Last Monday was a busy day
in Justice Boyer's court, a rough-and-tumble
fight in which six
men were involved Sunday morn
ing producing the principal busi
ness. The fight was staged in the
feed corral of the A. & B. Schus
ter Co., and those who partici
pated actively were Sam Smith,
his two sons, John and Veron,
and Frank Gillespie and his two
sons, Robert and Gilbert. The
trouble started with an exchange
of blows between two- sons of
the two families, but before the
fight that followed was ended all
six of the two factions were in
volved. Fists, clubs, pitchforks and
loaded canes were brought into
use in the fracas and one of the
Smith boys was carried from the
scene with an ugly wound in the
head, alleged to have been in
flicted with a loaded cane in the
hands of the elder Gillespie.
The latter received some cuts
and bruises at the hands of the
Smith belligerents.
After listening to the testi
mony of various witnesses Justice
Bover assessed fines of $10.00
against each of the three Smiths,
and against Gilbert Gillespie.
The latter was given a suspend
ed sentence of 15 days in jail, it
appearing that he started the
trouble. Robert Gillespie was
discharged, as it was shown that
he mixed in the fight simply in an
effort to stop it. Frank Gillespie,
the elder of the Gillespie clan,
was charged with a felony, it be
ing alleged that he struck young
Smith on the head with a deadly
weapon a loaded cane; he was
therefore placed under $500 bond
to appear for preliminary ex
amination in justice court May
1st. He is at liberty on his own
recognizance.
in passing sentence Justice
Boyer took occasion to give some
wholesome advice to all the par
ties involved in the fight, and
particularly to those who had re
cently been brought into his
court on other complaints. He
stated that he was determined to
stop such disgraceful affairs as
fchat of Sunday morning, even if
he had to send some of the parti
cipants to jail for long terms.
Cavalry Troop Ordered to Mexico
Sergeant McClinton, quarter
master's agent in Holbrook for
the U. S. army, received advices
Wednesday from Fort Apache
that the cavalry troop stationed
at that post had been ordered to
go at once to Columbus, N. M.,
and join in the expedition after
Villa into Mexico. The troop,
about 70 strong, will arrive in
Holbrook sometime Sunday with
horses and other equipment, and
will probably leave Sunday even
ing by special train for Colum
bus. Sergeant McClinton states
that other troops of cavalary
stationed in Texas have been or
dered to report at the front for
duty in Mexico, and it seems that
the authorities do not take the
reported death of Villa seriously.
Tipperary Bean is Not its Name
Do you know what they are
and how to properly prepare
them for the table? This crop
grows well in Arizona; is a good
yielder and succeeds under dry
farming conditions. It produces
more than other varieties. When
properly prepared teparies are
excellent. I have eaten them
prepared several ways which
were very palatable and several
wavs which were not palatable.
Do you know the best way to
prepare them? If not, find out.
Watch for recipes! Eat more
tepary beans the nutritious food
crop which can be so well grown
in our state. Be loyal! Many
farmers have these beans for
sale, but are unable to find good
markets for them because people
do not know what tbey are or
how to prepare them. Here is
an Arizona food product for Ari
zonans. A. L. Paschall, Farm
Advisor, Cochise-Santa Cruz

LOCAL MEN BUY BANK
St. Johns State Bank, Recent
ly Organized, Purchased this
Week by Holbrook and St
Johns Capitalists.
A deal was consumated yester
day in St. Johns whereby a con
trolling interest in the St. Johns
State Bank, formerly a branch
of the Nava jo-Apache Bank and
rT A. "I i a
irusi o., was ourcnased Dy a
number of well known capitalists
in Holbrook and St. Johns.
Immediately after purchasing
the three banks of the Navajo-
Apache Bank & Trust Co., two
weeks ago, T. M. Quebedeaux
and his associates organized each
bank as a separate corporation.
The Winslow and Holbrook banks
will be retained bv Mr. Quebe
deaux. and each will be operated
under a distinct management.
An offer by local men to purchase
the St. Johns bank was favor
ably considered by Mr. Quebe
deaux and his associates, and
the sale was closed yesterday in
St. Jonns, Mr. Quebedeaux and
representatives of the Holbrook
people driving up to that town
Wednesday morning.
By the terms of the sale Mr.
Quebedeaux retains some stoek
in the bank and he was elected
a director. Other directors are
John R. Hulet, D. J. Thomas,
H. Dannenbaum, Max Schuster,
C. H. Brown and L. R. Gibbons.
The officers are: President.
John R. Hulet; vice-president,
D. J. Thomas; cashier to be
selected later; assistant-cashier,
Abel Ortega.
These men represent some of
the strongest business institu
tions in the counties of Navajo
and Apache; their aggregate
wealth is large and their busi
ness acumen is universally ac
knowledged. That they have
purchased the controlling inter
est in the bank at St. Johns is
evidence that the bank is in
sound condition and a good- pay
ing property. It is also an as
surance that the bank will be
operated as a high-class financial
institution, an institution that
will be of great benefit to the
community in which it is located.

Situation in Warlike
A serious condition of affairs
confronts the national adminis
tration at Washington. Carranza
first chief of Mexico, has practi
cally demanded the withdrawal
of the U. S. troops from Mexico,
and he depends upon bis friend,
President Wilson, to comply with
his demand. So far the presi
dent has not issued the order
for the withdrawal of the troops,
but may do so at anv time, espe
cially if the dead body of the
bandit. Villa, is discovered again.
Early in the week President
Wilson sent a communication to
Germany, which is practically
an ultimatum, insisting chat the
Germans cease their unfair acts
on the seas. Germany has not
yet replied, and may not reply,
excepting by a continuation of
the style of warfare she is now
conducting. In such event,
diplomatic relations between the
two countries mav be severed,
and a declaration of war may
follow.
Altogether the sit jation is as
suming a very warliKe aspect,
and the United States may soon
be involved in two wars, one
with Germany and the other
with Mexico.
Financing Murdoch Extension Co.
Plans for the financing of the
Murdock Extension Mining Co.
of Oatman are being vigorously
prosecuted by the management.
The first allottment of shares are
being placed on the market at
the low price of five cents per
share. The management has an
option on a $20,000 equipment at
half its actual worth and those
who buy the stock will have the
advantage of this bargain.
Another attractive feature of
the company is the fact that the
preliminary work has all been
done and there is more than
$1,000 in the treasury which will
be devoted to advertising in
order that the first allottment of
stock may be quickly disposed
of. This is a necessity as the
option on the machinery must be
closed within sixty days.. The
entire proceeds of this sale can
be applied to the purchase of the
equipment as the sales will be
made throught the company offi
cials as a result of the advertis
ing campaign which will be
launched in the Arizona press as
ston as the corporation commis
sion issues the permit. The
machinery can be delivered to
the point where the shaft is to
be sunk by building less than
one hundred feet of road as the
old Needles-Oatman Highway
passes directly through the pro
perty. The Murdock Extension is
financed by women and all but
one of the officers are feminists.
Miss Kate Christy, daughter of
a former state treasurer and a
member of the well known fam
ily of that name which has play
ed such an important part in
banking circles in Arizona, is
treasurer. Miss Musa Rawlings,
secretary of the Woman's Demo
cratic League of Los Angeles
County, is secretary, and a num
ber of the prominent woman of
Arizona and California are dire
ctors. Mrs. Florabel Muir
Rogers, sister of the general
manager of the Gold Roads Mine
which is shipping $100.000 in
bullion each month, is chairman
of the board of directors.
