MINING MtN RE
PORT VILLUS DEATH
WORD SENT TO WASHINGTON
REGARDING HIM
SEND MEN TO PERSHING
IF CAMPAIGN AGAINST BANDIT IS
CONTINUED MORE THAN THE
2000 WILL BE SENT
El Paso, April 21.—Reports of Villa's
death were indirectly oonflrmed by an
American mining man, who forwarded
information to Washington that Villa
was wounded in tho knee on Maroh 29.
He traced his movements up to April
5, when be disappeared. Lack of med
ical attention and the nature of wound,
he said, would indicate that it was
highly probable that Villa was dead.
Consul Garcia is confident that con
firmation of the bandit's death will
soon be received.
San Antonio, April 21.—General
Funston is sending men to Pershing
to the number of more than 2,000 ad
ditional troops. There is reason to.be
lieve more will be sent if the oampaign
•gainst Villa is continued.
The troops, which were ordered to
Pershing's base, are at Columbus now
on duty on the border. What troops
will relieve them was unanounced
Pilling the vacant points may be left
to the government of Texas which may
•end its militia.
Pershing ordered the troops some
time ago. The undisguised hostility
of the various Carrans* organizations,
army men declare, makes necessary
the strengthening of Pershing's foroes,
Washington, April 21.—The adminis
tration is waiting for further reports
from the American offioers in Mexioo
before deciding as to whether the ex
pedition shall be withdrawn.
Indications are that the pursuit of
Villa is temporarily at a standstill
The cabinet discussed the Mexican
problem today. It is apparent that
the report of General Punston out
lined the situation as requiring aotion
from Washington.
If the break in diplomatic relations
«ith Germany is forseen it is virtually
certain the troops will be recalled from
Mexico immediately as mititary pru
danoe would require that steps be
taken for eventualities in Europe.
RANGERS CARRY TELEPHONES
Forest Rangers Carry Two and a Half Pound
Telephone
/-Washington, April 21 —A portable
telephone, made of aluminum and
weighing two and one-half pounds, the
invention of a forest officer R.
Adams, of Missoula, Montana, will be
part of the regular equipment of pa
trolmen on the national forests the
ooming field season. This instrument
la regarded as a great improvement
over the set formerly used, whioh
weighed ten pounds.
It is said that afield man equipped
with this telephone, a few yards of
light emergency wire, and a short piece
of heavy wire to make the ground con
nection, can out in anywhere along the
more than 20,000 miles of forest service
telephone lines and get in toaoh with
the headquarters of a supervisor or
distriot ranger. To talk, one end of
the emergency wire is thrown over the
telephone line the two ends are con
nected to the portable instrument, and
the instrument is connected to the
ground wire, the end of which must be
thrust into the damp earth or in water.
Contact with the line wire is made pos
sible by removal of the insulation from
few inohes of the emergency wire.
The Adams instrument does not
ring the tell of the receiving telephone,
bat instead causes a screeching sound
from a small magaphone-shapgd ap
paratus descriptively known as a
i'howler." This instrument is installed
at the ranger station telephone and is
said to give effective notioe that some
one is o'n the wire. If the field man
needs to talk with someone elsewhere
on the line, the ranger station instru
ment can be ased to ring up the person
wanted, when the conversation can be
oarried on.
Forest officers say that these port
able phones are especially valuable in
reporting fires and other emergencies
with the least possible delay, and also
in sending instructions to field men
and keeping the distriot rangers in-
V7f* ^ilSSS
formed as to the progress of work go
ing on in the field, thus supplementing
the regular telephone sets installed at
lookout points, ranger stations, and at
convenient intervals along foreBt ser
vice roads and trails.
CARELESSNESS IS CAUSE EPIDEMIC
Fall River County Man Feeds Diseased
Steer 1o Hogs—Hogs and Man Very III
Kapid City, April 21.—When one of
his yearling steers died reoently of an
unknow malady, J. Eokert of Ardmore,
skinned the carcass and fed it to the
hogs and ohickens. A few days later
these animals also oontraoted the
malady, as well as several more of his
steers and the ranoh dog, which had
stolen a bone from the hog pen.
Dr. Edmiston was •summoned and by
the time he reaohed Ardmore, Mr,
Eokert himself, had broken out with
the disease. The dootor made a hasty
examination pronounced the malady
as charbon, a very virulent contagious,
infectious disease, and took immediate
steps to cheok the trouble before it got
a firm hold upon that region. What
animals were yet unaffected were iso
lated, the others were killed and burn
ed the dog alone having recovered suf
ficiently to be spared. The ranoh was
thoroughly disinfected and Mr. Eokert
was placed under the care of a local
physician who reports him as about re
covered.
Dr. Edmiston believed he had the
situation well under contol before he
left for the oity.
BIRDS AND THEIR TRAITS
A Plea From Dr. Thorns for the Extermina
tion of the English Sparrow
Vermillion, Aprtl 21,—"Kill the Eng
lish sparrow and do not enoourage the
squirrel if you want song birds about
yon," says Dr. Craig Thorns
of
the Uni­
versity of South Dakota, who for many
years has been a oareful student and
observer of South Dakota bird life.
The sparrow Dr. Thoms declares,
eventually orowds out the other birds.
It multiplies rapidly and preempts the
trees and spaces of the other birds who
move out and away before the disagee
ably aggressive neighbor
Birds, like the Hudson Bay trapper,
like exoiusive territory. They oould
never become dwellers in flats. This
desire for exoiusive space privileges,
Dr. Thoms states, is a bird principle
so well established in the bird world
that a strong bird will yield to a weak
er that has got in ahead and acquired,
prior title to a tree and adjaoent air
and ground rights. But the sparrow
is no respeotor of laws, traditions or
persons. He orowds into bird houses
and into other bird territory, He
doesn't fight the other birds he simply
jostles them and orowds them and
makes himself obnoxious and they
move out when he moves in. The
sparrow is a finch and doeB some little
good by eating weed seeds, slugs and
bugs. But his ohief diet is grain and
he is not of great eoonomio value. Bird
experts are quite unanimous in their
approval of a oampaign to exterminate
them.
Opinion is divided as to ho* far the
squirrel bothers and preys on birds
and beeps them out of the oommunity.
It is generally believed, however, that
squirrels eat birds eggs and that the
more squirrels the fewer birds there
will be. Not many squirrels have been
introduced as yet into South Dakota
and Dr, Thoms believes that for the
sake of the birds the squirrels should
not be weloomed.

WRITES OF HOT SPRINGS
Chas.^Bruce, Sioux City Tribune Man, Writes
of Recent Visit Here
Chas. Bruce, the rep~esentative of
the Sioux City Tribune with the Sioux
City commission men, who visited this
city last week gives this plaoe a good
boost in the following whioh is reprint
ed below:
"The boosters, before starting for
Douglas, Wyoming, deoided at a hur
ried meeting to send a message to
Congressman T, J. Steel, who has made
this trip annually with the booster
parties, but was prevented from going
this time by urgent business at the
capital. The wire sent to Mr. Steele,
while inclined to be a "josh," will un
doubtedly be weloomed. The message
was as follows:
Hot water, hot town, bees buzzing,
birds singing, grasshoppers full fledg
ed Bunch busy boosting and dodging
water. Off for Casper tonight- We
miss you in the white lights.
About twelve miles from Hot Springs
a cave of mystery was visited by part
of the Sioux City boosters who had the
time and inclination to gain some
knowledge as to the picturesque sights
of thetiip around the western terri
tory.
Those of the party claim that "Wind
Cave" excels anything ever seen in
oaverns. The underground
reoessf
of Wind Cave are very numerous, and
aocording to the government surveys
there are some 96 miles of passages.
Visitors are provided with a oandle
and a guide and the strange formations
are shown. It would take all day to
become familiar with all the ins snd
outs and there are a number of the
passages that have never been ex
plored.
Wind Cave gets its name because
there is a strong current of air whioh
surges in our out of the entranoe. In
the various chambers are frost like
formations whioh visitors are forbid
den from touching as the merest touch
will destroy the orystal effect which is
very beautiful.
The Blaok Hills Commercial Club
Secretaries Association is planning to
advertise thiB park extensively and is
stooking up the park proper with buf
falo, elk end other animals. The park
proper covers some 9,000 sores and ao
cording to information there are an
nually 5,000 visitors."
