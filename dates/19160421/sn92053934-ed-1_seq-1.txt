Washington. April 214 Secre
tary Landing, who conferred with
the president before the cabinet
meeting said lie did not expect
any action until a reply was re
ceived from Germany or unless
another ship carrjintr Americans
were torpedoed by a German sub
marine. He said that In case dip

Gerard Presents ote.
Word from Ambassador Gerard at
Berlin that he had delivered the Amer
ican note to the German government!
and some indication from him as to
how it was received were awaited w'lth
keen expectancy by administration of
ficials today.
Unofficial advices early today say
ing that he had presented the com
munication to the foreign office last
evening and that the chancellor had
not yet seen it because of his absence
at army headquarters were read with
interest by officials.
Fear Sea Disaster.
1 Pending Germany's reply to Amer
ica's demands that she immediately
abandon the present method of con
ducting the submarine warfare, one of
the chief concerns of officials here is
the possibility of another attack on a
shin carrying Americans. It was ad
mitted that an immediate rupture
could only be prevented by proof that
Gerrnanv had been unable to commun
icate with her submarine commanders.
It is suggested that the German for
eign office may be delayed In replying
immediately because of a series of re
ligious holidays in Germany which be
gan today and continue until Tues
day.
Bryan Hopes to Preserve reace.
Former Secretary of State Bryan,
ho is here in the hope, as he ex
pressed it, of being of some assistance
in preserving peace, continued his
conference with democratic members
of congresss today.
-Mr. Hryan's view is that "it would
be a crime to enter the present war."
The former secretary hopes that di
plomacy In the submarine controversy
will not fail, although his chief con
cern, he said, is with the problem if
diplomacy does fail.
"The responsibility for declaring
ar is upon congress, not upon the
president," declared Mr. Bryan, "and
it is fair to assume that when the duty
ot acting falls upon congress the pres
ident will be willing to refrain from
embarrasing congress, as he was anx
ious that he should not be embar
rassed." He suggests arbitration of any quar
rel that may be had with any European
nation.
South American Press.
Rio Janeiro, April 21. The publica
tion of th. American note to Germany
created a deep impression upon public
opinion and the oress. The Journal
ie Commercio says:
"The United States profoundly im
pressed by the responsibility it as
sumed in the American continent by

ervatlon of the Monroe doctrine, feels
Nearly that if Germany is victorious
sooner or later she will turn against

Japan Gives
Objection to
Alien Bills
Washington, April 21. Viscount
Chinda, the Japanese ambassador, con
ferred with President Wilson today
over the provision of the pending Im
migration bill which proposed to en
close In the law the so-called "gentle
men's agreement" restricting immi
gration of Japanese laborers. A mem
orandum on the subject has been pre
sented to the state department
The proposed Inclusion Is a law of
an Informal agreement which Japan
has promised on honor to fulfill, ac
cording to information between for
mer Secretary Root and Am
bassador Takahura and is understood
to be repugnant to the Japanese gov
ernment.
Other proposed Asiatic exclusion
features in the bill as It passed the
house and has been reported to the
senate are understood to be the sub
ject of objection.
For many obvious reasons the attl
tude of the administration is said to
be one of disinclination to irritate the
situation between Japan and the Unit
ed States which has been smoldering
since the California anti-alien land
law negotiations went into an indefin
ite stage three years ago this sum
mer. The United States never has re
plied to Japan's last note on the Call
fornia land law. One portion of the
bill which Is understood to draw the
resentment of the Japanese govern
ment Is the Inclusion, by inference at
least placing Japanese in the excluded
class with Hindus, although the same
paragraph of the bill excepts from the
exclusion such as are covered in "ex
isting agreements."
This phrase refers to the Root-Ta-kahura
agreement.

MRS.LOUISEROWE
NOW EXONERATED
Defendant in Chicago City Hall Con.
troversy Is Freed of Blame by
Civil Service Commission.
Chicago, April 21. The report of
the-jeity CtviT service commission, -an
nounced today on charges o.tfe'sSPw jj
Waller Eaton, former super'inted&enWj
of social surveys, that Mrs. Louise Os
borne Rowe, commissioner of public
welfare, had levied upon her for one-
third of her $3,000 salary for the ben
efit of Mayor William Hale Thomp
son's sister-in-law, Mrs. Margaret E.
Mivelaz, says that there was no evi
dence of violation of the civil service
law.
The commission decided that Mrs
Eaton's testimony was unsubstantiated
and therefore Mrs. Rowe is not guilty
because it is "the word of one witness
against the other." Another conclus
ion of the commission is that there
was no evidence connecting Mrs. Mi
velaz with the matter.
Mrs. Eaton's chargei caused a heat
ed controversy during February and
March. Investigations were started
by the civil service commission and a
committee from the city council with
the result that the commission has
now announced. State's Attorney
Maclay Hoyne has announced that he
will make an investigation of the
case.
The investigation was begun by the
commission on orders from Mayor
Thompson. "Mazie says you've got to
come across," a phrase imputed to
Mrs. Rowe by Mrs. Eaton and refer
ring to the wife of the mayor, became
one of the principal features of the in
vestigation. On this point Captain
Percy Coffin, head of the commission.
said:
The expression bore the same rela
tion to the Eaton-Rowe controversy as
the red, green and purple lights do to
a well managed scenic production. It
added aspect and enriched the normal
vision. It was an artful phrase, coined
to throw glamour on a new political
diversion."

GermanPlot
Agent Tells
Aids Names
New York, April 21. Horst von der
Goltz, the German soldier of fortune
and secret agent whose statement jl
details pf the pTbrto destroy" the Wet
land canal was made public by the
Bfftish government last night, is now
detained at the EHis Island immigra-
j0n gtation here.'fv He was brought
liere from Liverpool on March 28 in
the custody of a Scotland Yard detec
tive with the understanding that after
he had made his statements to federal
officers or a grand jury he should be
returned to England to be detained as
a war prisoner until the war is over.
Soon after arriving here he was
taken before the United States district
attorney and it was said that he re
vealed to the federal officer most of
the details of the Welland canal plot.
As a result, it is said, of the informa
tion he gave to federal officials, indict
ments were found a few days ago
charging complicity in the Welland
canal conspiracy against Captain
Franz von Papen, the recalled mili
tary attache of the Germany embassy;
Captain Hans Tauscher, who is said
to be agent of the Krupps; Wolfe von
Igel, von Papen's former secretary, in
whose office federal officials seized the
documents now claimed by the Ger
man embassy. Alfred A. Fritzen and
Constantino Covani.
There was no mention of von Igel's
name in von der Goltz' statement a3
made public in England. The German
embassy now demands von Ige'.'s re
lease from arrest on the ground that
he is a member of the German diplo
matic organization in this country.
Many names of German propagand
ists or Germans employed in alleged
unneutral activities mentioned in von
der Goltz' statement have nover be
fore figured publicly in that connec
tion, and can only be Identified by In
ference. Captain Tauscher was ar
rested about two weeks ago and Is at
liberty under bail. Fritzen and Covani
have not been arrested and the latter
is believed to be In Italy.

BACHELOR'S ESTATE
REACHES 6 FIGURES
Muscatine, Iowa, April 21. That
the estate of the late Charles Hampe,
eccentric old bachelor, who was
found dead in his poorly furnished
room on West Second street last Feb
ruary, goes well Into six figures was
learned today when the report of the
appraisers was made known. J. J.
Fishburn, J. F. Harris and F. W. Ev
ersmeyer were the appraisers and
they yesterday completed the task of
determining what inheritance tax
shall be collected on the estate.
The estate is not only one of the
largest that has been appraised for
the purpose in this county but alsoi
shows the unusual situation of having
more than $65,000 cash in the banks.
Exclusive of land in Nebraska and
Kansas the appraisers declare that
the value of the estate is more than
$110,000. Of the estate in Iowa the
property is confined to this and Lee
counties. Another unusual feature is
the small proportion of the estate that
is in real property, the vast bulk
being in monies, mortgages and cred
its.
Charles Hampe was the second and
last of two brothers, both of whom
were of an eccentric character. The
brother died several years ago.

were in the building, the remainder
being at home for the Easter vacation.
Buildings immediately adjacent to the
Union also suffered heavy loss.
Several of the students had narrow
escapes but none sustained severe in
juries. It was said today the loss to
students quartered in the Union will
be approximately $200 each, mostly
for clothing and books.

ments of American troops from
points along the border to the army

they will be held In readiness to
reinforce General Pershing's army
in case of necessity, still continued
today. Dispatches from the front
indicated that everything was
quiet and that American troops in
Mexico were awaiting develop
ments at Washington before mak
ing any further effort to capture
Francisco Tllla.
Officials of the de facto government!
said there was no basis for the reportsi
that uprisings were imminent in,
northern Durango and lower Chihua-;
hua. It was explained at Juarez that-;
the movement of the Carranza troops.
into the Parral district was not in
tended as a threat to bar the further
advance of the American forces but
that the de facto soldiers had been.,
sent there to preserve order and pre
vent destruction of private property.
Andres Garcia, Mexican consul, said,

hoped that in a few days the order

Washington, April 21. A border re

ed use of the Mexican railways to Coli
onel Brown and the 10th cavalry to.
"withdraw from Parral" was explain
ed today by army officials as merely a
movement of the American advance
field base near Parral. Secretary
Baker Insisted there were no orders
or information upon which to base a
withdrawal rumor. The department
had been previously officially advised
that Mexican authorities would not oh-'
ject to a base somewhat nearer Par

Funston and all Information indicated
the Villa hunt was practically at a!

April 21.1 The fight at Parral. where.
according to indisputable evidence
reaching here today, Carranza troops
in force attacked the cavalry command
of Major Frank Tompkins, has
changed the entire aspect of the Villa
chase so far as immediate military
plans are concerned.
Heretofore, the American troops
have reckoned only on meeting opposi
tion from brigands, but resistance
from regular armed troops of the Mex
ican army put the American military
leaders immediately under the neces
sity of preparing for serious difficul
ties. It can be stated that within a
few hours after the Parral fight, the
new disposition of American troops
was partly completed and within two
days its most important features had
been entirely carried out.
On April 12, about noon. Major
Frank Tompkins of the 13th cavalry,
who chased the Villistas across the
international line at Columbus, went
into Parral with only a small portion
of his force, which totaled about 150
men including a pack train outfit. He
had troops M and K of the Thirteenth.
