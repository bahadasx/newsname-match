Can't Give In. Says German Official
Z. •_! •C^.rv!
THE PRESIDENT
II THE GNATS
NOBODY wants war—unless a few munitions man- j
ufacturers arc considered. Th« United Stales:
. dues lidt want war with Germany or any other nation.)
President Wilson does not waul war. At any time j
in the last two years, the president easily could have
plunged the country into the world carnage had be
so desired. Instead, he has pursued what many per- j
sons have criticised as altogether too pacific a course.!
Yt\V today we have the spectacle before us of
United states senators and representatives I
who, out 1 of the smallness of their hearts and souls,
now make the wanton and miserable charge that the:
preflident'i motive in presenting the ultiuatum to I
Germany yesterday was for political effect.
ACCORDING to Rep, Mann of Illinois, republican
leader in congress, the president "wants to
bring us into a war with Germany so as to insure his |
re-election."
AM) with what shanic the people of this stale must \
read the miserable insinuation of Sen. Jones,
who said: "I cannot understand why the president
should take this course. All he did was to '-all us to
gether and lell us what he had done, not asking ad
vice or assistance or submitting and proposition for
our action."
SMALL men with small thoughts! Politics! Poli- j
fus! That's all they can think of. Thank (Jod,
the average eitisen of the United States is not so
dwarfed and pitifully small as some of his "repre
sentatives'* in congress,
