Deadlock Which Threatened Re

ANOTHER TRIAL FOR VOLUNTEERS
Laborites Will Consent to Gradual
Extension of Conscription, if
Necessary.
London, April 21. The whole Brit
ish nation was surprised and the great
majority of the people were cheered
by the unexpected announcement after
the cabinet meeting yesterday morn
ing that the cabinet deadlock over the
question of extending military con
scription had been compromised. Thus
thn country Is saved from the anxious
days it would have suffered until Par
liament reassembles on Tuesday and
from the newspaper controversy which
would have raged meantime.
The labor party, which was the only
political group united against further
measures of compulsion, is credited
with paving the way to the agree
ment The leader of the labor party,
Arthur Henderson, president of the
board of education, proposed, accord
ing to the reports, a further trial of
voluntary enlistment, with the promise
that the laborltes would consent to a
gradual extension of conscription if it
proved necessary to secure the num
ber of men which the military author
ities consider essential.
The labor members, together with
others, demanded that they be in
formed on the exact position what
number of men had already been en
rolled and pledged; how many the war
ofllce requires to enlarge the army and
replace the wastage by casualties and
other causes. Consequently a secret
session of both houses will be con
vened Tuesday at which the govern
ment will supply full information.

Paris. April 20. A strong force of
Russian troops disembarked at Mar

General Joffro welcomed the Rus
sians in an order of the day, saying
their arrival was another striking
proof of the devotion of Russia to the
common cause. .. . .
The arrival of the Russian troops is
regarded here as au event of great
importance.
The Russians came on a great flotil
la of transports. Not a single word of
their coining was permitted to become
known until they actually had coiv
eluded the journey and were landing
on French coil.
The Russian forces will be used to
fill in paps on the western front caused
by the recent fighting.
The arrival ot these soldiers has
made a profound impression in France
which is deeply moved by this mani
testation of Russia's good will.
Marseilles, France, April 20. The

DYE STUFFS
Shipment of 15,000 Tons Coming
to United States
MUST BE CONSUMED IN AMERICA
Can Not Be Re-Exported to Great
Britain or Her
Allies
Wasbingf on April 21. The German
government has agreed to permit ex-
portation'to the United States of 15,-
000 '-tons of dye stuffs, lack of which
has ' seriously affected American tex
tile manufacturers. Notification to this
fleet' was contained in a note delivered
yesterday by Count von Rernstorff, tho
German embassador, to Secretary
anslng. 1
The ' communication explains that,
while Germany refused at first to per
mit exportation of dye stuffs unless
they be exchanged for American goods
now excluded from Germany by the
British blockade, after careful consid-
eiation of the situation it has been
seen "that this blockade has resulted
in serious embarrassment to those
American industries which are in need
of dye stuffs" and the imperial Ger
man government now is prepared to
make "a single exception" in permit
ting exportation in this instance. It
is required only that the dye stuffs
shall be consumed by American man
ufacturers and not re-exported to
Great P.ritain or her allies. It is ex-
poeted that the state department Im
mediately will make representations to
Great Britain to insure the safe ar
rival of the dye stuffs in this country.

LEGALITY OF
Join in Note Answerine Protest of
United States
CIVIL WAR PRECEDENT CITED
Great Britain and France Maintain
Restriction of Imports is
Justified.
Washington. April 20. According
to authentic information reaching
Washington. Great Britain and France
in their joint note replying to the
American protest against interferences
with neutral trade, mako no attempt to
dispute principles contended for by the
United States, but insist that those
principles have been given legal inter
pretation and application by the Allies
in their blockade of Germany and
Austria.
Tills note, which will be handed to
the State Department within the next
day 'or two by the British anil French
Ambassadors, is understood to be long
and extremely technical, treating of
the whole subject on a purely legal
basis, and relying largely upon the pre
cedents laid down by the United States
n the civil war. It is said the Allies
assume that the United States Govern
nient does not contend that it has the
right to ship goods w ithout restriction
into Germany or Austria through con
tiguous neutral countries such as Hol
land, Sweden and Denmark.
flic concession of tiie right to block
ade an enemy country, which is uni
versally recognized, is regarded as
necessarily carrying with it the right
to regulate the admission of goods to
the neutral country, evidently destined
to be transferred to the enemy. Con
sequently it Is contended that it is
within the spirit of International law
to limit imports into a neutral country,
such as Holland, of goods that might
be of use to Germany and Austria, to
the amount normally consumed in the
neutral country.
EUROPE'S BLINDED SOLDIERS
H. Dewey Will Receive Contribu

Thousands of soldiers in the present
Kuropean war have been made per

fighting is such that it lias caused
more Injuries of this nature than any
previous conflict in the. world's his

Toald these suffering victims of
the 'great tragedy special training
schools are being conducted in Ln
land and France in which the sight
less soldiers are being taught a trade
through whlcli they may eventually
become self-supporting during the
cheerless years that must mark the re
malnder of their lives.
While tho blind men are attending
these schools they are being support
ed largely through the contributions
of those who have the blessing of eye
sight and to carry on this humane
work the Permanent Wind Relief
Fund has been established.
Charles II. Dewey, treasurer of the
Pennington County Savings bank, will
receive and forward to tlte treasurer
of the fund In the . United States,

contiibutions that may be entrusted
to him.
Every single contribution will help
in tills most worthy cause and a delay

darkness for the little that can be done
for his mental as well as physical com

dmiralty Chief Von Holtzendorff
Says Limit Has Been Reached
BF.EAK WOULD BE SUICIDAL
Is Positive No German Submarine Was
Responsible for Sinking of
the Sussex.
Deri In, April 21. "Ge-many can go
no further in concessions to the Unit
ed States," said Admiral von Holtzcn-
dorlf, chief of the German admiralty
staff in au intervied with the United
Press correspondent today.
"Hut remember," the admiral con
tinued, "that Germany does not want
to break with the United States. That
would be insanity. A German subma
rine did not sink the Sussex. Of that
I am as positive as I urn of anything
that has happened in this war. I do not
believe that the American people want
to declare war against Germany. I do
not think the United States wants to
protect England."
Washington, April 21. While the
United States waits for Germany to
reply to the note demanding the im
mediate abandonment of present meth
ods of conducting submarine warfare,
one of the chief sources cf concern at
Washington i the possibility of anoth
er attack on a peaceful ship carr;. injj
Americans, before the Morim gov em
inent has (ktermined upon us coursv.
In stub an event it is admitted an im
mediate rupture could be prevented
only by proof that Germany had been
unable to communicate with her sub
marine commanders.
In explaining the demand of the
United States, olticials said yesterday
that, while abandonment of the pres
ent Illegal methods at once was essen
tial to continuance of diplomatic rela
tions, tiie United States might agree
to German submarines operating un
der the strict restrictions of cruiser
warfare. It was emphatically reiter
ated, however, that a discussion of
that phase would not be entered into
until the present campaign wns
brought to a stop. The United States
stands firm in its determination not
to tolerate the unlawful and inhumane
sinking of another ship.

form of a drive on the extreme right
flank of the French forces in this
section, three successive attacks being
delivered at Les Eparges, about 1?
miles southeast of Verdun on the edge
of the Woevre plain.
Military observers have long expect
ed some such operation on the part of
the Germans as part of a squeezing
movement Intended to force the evacu
ation of the fortress. The new at
tempt was unsuccessful, however,
Paris has reported, the Germans hav
ing been driven by a counter-attack
out of the 200 yards of trenches they
