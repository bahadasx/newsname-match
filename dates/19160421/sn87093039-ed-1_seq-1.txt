Two Red Apple Nabobs Return
Charley Gibbs and Geo. Watson ar
rived from Seattle Monday afternoon.
Mr. Gibbs, for many years a citizen of
this valley, living near Peshastin, where
he planted one of the first apple or
chards in the upper Wenatchee valley,
spent the winter in the balmy atmos
phere of San Diego, Cal., and says it
was great. It is only an apple nabob
who let co at the right time that can
aSord to indulge in climatic luxuries.
The rest of as, less fortunate or fore
thoughtful, remained right here and
toughed it out with the snow. Mr.
Watson, too, is also one of the for
tunate ones who accumulated a com
petency during the hey days of the
apple industry and had sense enough
to know he had plenty ol this world's
(foods. He spent the winter on the
Sound but told The Echo that he had
made up his mind to build a home
here and put in the summers in Leav
enworth.
PROGRESSIVE REPUCUCANS
HELD MASS CONVENTION
In Wenatchee Last Saturday—Nominated
Delegates to State Meet in
Seattle May 4
At a mass convention held in We
natchee last Saturday the progressives
decided to hold aloof from the republi
can party for the present. The ques
tion of a possible alignment of the pro
preisive and republican forces in the
ensuing campaign was discussed and it
was the concensus of opinion that it
was for the best interests of progressive
principles that the progressive organi
zation be maintained and be guided in
the future by the action of the national
convention to be held in Chicago in
June next. The following delegates
to the state convention in Seattle were
named: Z. A. Lanham, S. P. Beecher,
Dr. D. W. King, D. D. Olds, R. S.
Ludington and Deed H. Mayar.
Chelan county will present two can
didates for membership on the state
delegation to the national progressive
convention in the persons of R. S.
Ludington and P. E. Ward.
The following resolutions were
adopted: "Be it resolved by the pro
gressives of Chelan county in conven
vention assembled that we reaffirm our
allegiance to the progressive national
platform of 1912, believing that a pro
gram of social and economic justice
must be written into our national
statutes; that we reaffirm our confi
dence in the leadership of the Honor
able Theodore Roosevelt and com
mend his insistent and steadfast Amer
icanism, and believe that he possesses
those qualifications for chief executive
of this nation in a degree possessed by
no other American and demand that he
be made the party nominee in 1916;
that we favor an adequate system of
national defense and to this end we are
opposed to the voluntary system of en
listment which is both unjust and inef
ficient, and urge that either the Swiss
or Australian system be substituted for
the present costly and inadequate na
tional force; we believe in a tariff com
mission with power to fix rates; we de
nounce the present democratic admin
istration for its hypocritical pre-election
promises of national economy, its ex
travagance, its adherence to "pork
barrel" methods of appropriations and
its failure to deal promptly and vigor
ously with questions in which national
honor is at stake."
A banquet will be tendered to dele
gates to the state convention on May 3
by the King county progressives at the
Press club.
Robert Marks, alter spending the
winter with his father in Canada, re
turned last Saturday and will remain
here indefinitely. *
Mrs. J. B. Schons and children re
turned from Wenatchee yesterday after

"SYLVIA" AT THE SCENIC
Presented by the High School—Greeted ,
By Capacity House ,
The presentation of the charming
pastoral operetta, "Sylvia," by the
high school scholars at the Scenic
theatre last Friday evening was wit
nessed by a full house. Every seat
was occupied. Altogether it was a
very creditable amateur performance.
For one thing there were no waits or
forgotten lines. Everything moved
off as smoothly as if the characters were
professionals. Of course the audience
wanted everything repeated, and just
by way of showing its impartiality made
no distinction. Everybody had to re
peat. The audience was heartily in
sympathy with the effort of the high
school class and was generous with its
applause.
Miss Meier, who has charge of the
musical deoartment in the high school,
drilled the young ladies and gentlemen
and is entitled to much credit for the
successful presentation. The plot
opened with a hayfield scene, very ap
propriately staged, where Sylvia the
court lady, and Betty the farmer's
daughter, both agree to an exchange
of lovers for the day and seal the bar
gain with a magic flower. There are
complications and embarassments, all
of which are straightened out in the
last act, where normal relationships are
resumed and everything ends happily.
The rustic dance by four little misses
in the first act, was charmingly done
and pleased the audience.
From experience we have learned it
is highly imprudent to make distinc
tions in the parts assumed when an
amateur rendition is under considera
tion, wherefore it shall suffice to re
mark that all and several acquitted
themselves with credit

Tramp Killed at Chiwaukum
The body of a man was found beside
the track near the water tank at Chi
waukum, Wednesday morning of this
week at 5:15 o'clock. According to
testimony taken by Coroner Templeton
the man was about 35 years old,

overcoat, blue serge coat and vest, and
gray striped trousers. In aW.O. W.
local union booklet, serial No. 53,901,
was written the name James Cannon.
Twenty-five cents in silver was found in
his pocket. An effort will be made by
Coroner Templeton to find his relatives
and advise them of his death. The
body was very badly mutilated. The
supposition is that he tried to get on

under the wheels! boSy wft taken

WENATCHEE ATTORNEY
ATTEMPTS SUICIDE HERE
Shoots Himself Thru the Head—Suffer
ing From Incurable Ailment
Caused Despondency
Ira Thomas of Wenatchee shot him
self in the head last Tuesday morning
some time before daylight. He was
found in a dazed condition between
7:30 and 8:00 a. m. by N. A. Nelson
as he was on his way down town to his
jewelry store. He was lying under the
wooden walk that spans the gulch in
the west part of town where the steps
lead down to the steam laundry, and
beside him was a pistol. Mr. Nelson
at once notified Mayor Day who, with
a doctor and a stretcher, proceeded to
the place and brought Mr. Thomas to
the Leavenworth hospital. An exam
ination showed that a bullet had en
tered the roof of the mouth and came
out at the top of the head to the right
of the center. Doctors Hoxsey and
Judah dressed the wound, which they
pronounced serious, tho not necessarily
fatal unless complications result, which
is not improbable in his weakened con
dition.
Mr. Thomas underwent two surgical
operations about eighteen months ago
for serious bladder disorders, and for
over a year retired from all employ
ment. Last fall he improved so much
that he again entered the practice of
law and his many friends hoped he was
entirely cured. Recently, however,
his old trouble came back in an aggra
vated form and the slight hope of relief
is believed to have resulted in despon
dency and the determination to end it
all. A Wenatchee account states that
he bought a pistol there a week before
coming here last Monday afternoon, if"'
where he met a number of friends and v
seemed to be in a cheerful frame of
mind. He went to bed at the St.':
Francis rooming house at 12 o'clock ''*
Monday night. When he got up no-""
one seems to know. The attempt on
his life must have occurred between r"
the hours of 12 midnight and 7 in the
morning. ■•'ft.
Ira Thomas had been a resident of !>l
Wenatchee about twelve years, coming '■
from Nebraska. He was a lawyer of : ■''•''
ability and standing at the bar in We
natchee. Up to the time of his first 1
attack two years ago he enjoyed a good
practice. His age, tho not known to '
us exactly, is about sixty years. He
has a son at Wenatchee who graduated
from the Washington university about
three years ago as a civil engineer.
He also has a married daughter there.
His wife died a number of years ago.
A report from the hospital last even
ing was to the effect that Mr. Thomas
was resting easy and showing no signs
of collapse, with a fair chance of recov
ery. He will, however, in any event
lose the sight of one eye. The bullet
having severed the optic nerve on the
right side. ' '.' '"j _
Japanese Logger Killed Monday
G. Hierohata, who was employed in
the logging camp of Frank Yama, an- .
other Japanese, on White river above
Wenatchee lake, was killed the first of
this week. He was brought here.and ,
buried in the local cemetery yesterday
afternoon. A number of his country
men attended the funeral. Hierohata
with others was felling a huge cedar
tree which, in falling, struck a standine
tree and sheered to one side, striking
Hierohata on the chest and j inflicting
other wounds. He lived about three .
hours. • ' "
