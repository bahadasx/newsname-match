LEADS TO
SPECIAL MEETINB
ON SATURDAY
Deputy Sheriffs and Drivers of Autos
Unoer Suspicion Were Witnesses
.County Attorney Swears Out Two
Warrants of Arrest.
A special meeting of the Board of
Supervisors was called by Chairman
Witt and convened in the court house
on Saturday afternoon last the purpose
01 which, as outlined by the Chairman,
was to investigate the conduct of the
Sheriff of the county and his deputies.
The special meeting of the Board
was called as a result of a trip made
by three automobiles from Morenci
to Lordsburg on Wednesday after
noon, April 12th, returning about four
a. m. on the 13th; the attempted ar
rest of the drivers of these cars on a
charge of violation of the prohibition
law by Deputy Sheriff Dave Andress;
their release, after they had been stop
ped on the streets of Clifton, by rea
son of statements La Point is alleged
to have made to Deputy Andress.
As a result of the investigation by
.the Board two complaints charging-violation
of the prohibition amendment,
were sworn to by County Attorney E.
E. Wall, one complaint against Law
rence LaPoint and one complaint
against Deputy Sheria Tom McCul
loch. Their preliminary hearing will
be held Monday. '
Those present at the hearing were
Supervisors Witt, Dutton and Await;
County Attorney Wall and Deputy
Sheriff J. V. Martin.
The witnesses sworn and examined
were: J. V. Martin, Dick Walz,
driver of the LaPoint car on the night
in question; D. E. Andress, deputy
sheriff; Bud Smith, Night Marshal of
Clifton; Lawrence LaPoint, Henry
Daley, F. Cody.
-A summary of th testimony adduc
ed at the examination shows that
three cars left Morenci on the after
noon of the 12th, passing through
Clifton going in the direction of Lords
burg, which excited the suspicion of
Deputy Sheriff D. E. Andress, who
in company with Deputy Sheriff Mar
tin and Night Officer Smith, watched
for their return during the early hours
Thursday morning. The cars retuned
at shore intervals abeut 4 a. m. and
were halted. The three officers who
stopped the cars swear they were
heavily loaded with boxes. The
drivers of the cars swear they were
not loaded. No investigation of the
purported contents of the cars were
made by Deputy Sheriff Andress when
he stopped them because he swears he
was told by LaPoint that his car had
been accompanied from Lordsburg by
Deputy Sheriff McCulloch.
After all the witnesses had been ex
amined the County Attorney filed the
complaints in the office of Justice J.
A. McWilliams and warrants were is
sued for the arrest of La Point and
McCulloch.
J." V. Martin's Testimony,
examined and testified substantially
as- follows:
"On the morning of Thursday the
13th 1 assisted Deputy Andress in
holding up some autos that were
loaded, but I don't know what they
were loaded t with; didn't examine
the contents. These cars were driven
by Walz and LaPoint Cody and Daley.
Andress and Bud Smith were with
me at the time.. I did not go through
the cars because he (La Point) said
Tom McCullough came in with him
and that he had seen Cash in Lords
burg. "1 heard La Point say he understood
everything was understood. He said
McCulloch had come in with him. La
Point talked to Dave in a whisper, 1
understood him to say: 'Cash is in
Iiordsburg; these are his gloves.'
Then I said to Dave: 'Why are we
not going to take them? Dave said:
'Tom went with him.' and then he
out with h:s gun and threw it av.ay
and said: T will quit.'
' Cody was driving the next car and
told me Tom McCulloch had been
nding with him. Then Daley's car
came along. All three cars were
ht vily loaded and the sprnigs mash
ed. I saw the boxes In Cody'B car.
We were looking for bootleggers that
night and the reason 1 didn't make
any arrests was because McCulloch
and Andress were both my bosses."
Testimony of Dick Walz.
Dick Walz, an auto driver for Can
sler & Albrecht, testified he was
employed to go to Lordsburg by La
Point in Morenci. I did not know
how far we were going but knew
we would go -as far as Duncan at
least. In Clifton Tom McCulloch
got in the car and rode to Duncan
and after we stopped there fifteen
minutes the three of us went on to
Lordsburg. While In Lordsburg I saw
the Sheriff of this county there. We
came back the same night, Lawrence
La Point and Tom McCulloch in my
car. I brought a bottle of whiskey
and a couple of bottles of beer for
myself. There were no boxes or
anything else in my car and neither
SUPERV
LD
INVESTIGATION
Tom McCulloch or La Point stored
anything in my car to my knowledge.
Question by Supervisor Dutton:
"Who loaded, your car when you came
back?-'
A. They loaded it themselves.
Continuing his testimony Walz said:
'When we were stopped in Clifeon
Dave Andress talked to Lawrence
but I don't know what he said. They
were rattling off in Spanish. I did
hear Lawrence say that he had bor
rowed a pair of gloves from Sheriff
Cash in- Lordsburg. We left the
main street of Lordsburg about ten
o'clock at night. I guess Sheriff
Cash was in Lordsburg when we left
hut he was not at the car.
Testimony of Deputy Sheriff Andress.
D. E. Andress being the next wit
ness called, testified as follows:
Mr. Wall: Q. Mr. Andress, your
name is Dave Andreas? A. Yes.
Q. And you are a Deputy Sheriff
of Greenlee County, Arizona? '
A.. Yes, sir. '
Q. And have been for the last
year or more? A.' Yes,-sir. -'
Q. ' On the morning of the 13th,
last, did you and Mr. Martin and Mr.
, Smith have occasion to stop any auto
mobiles here in Clifton? A. Early in
.the evening, Mr. Wall
I Q. Well, you know this is an in
vestigation to ascertain what was
brought in those cars; what knowledge
Mr. Cash or Mr. McCulloch may have
had relative thereto, and why these
people were not arrested; now, you
can just state to the Chairman and
-Board all you know, about.it.
! A. To start with, I saw Daley go
down in that little, "Hup" car; I was
standing on the bridge; he was head
ing down that way; I knew this "Hup"
was coming and going and bringing in
'"booze," or had reason to think that;
and that evening I was up town and
Mr. Martin said "are you ready to go
home, and I said "no, I am going to
watch the road tonight." Bud Smith
was standing there and he said "I
will stay with you if you want any
help. And I said "all right." I have
stopped a couple of cars recently and
they almost run over me, so I told
him I probably would need some help.
I have been on the road and 'know
tit's car has 1 been coming in pretty
regular., I said "I saw a car g6ing
down this morning and things don't
look right to me and I am going to
jSnd out." Then we went over to the
Central Hotel and Smith had a key
to the office, and we sat in there.
iVe walked down in front of J. & A.
Smith's and there ware two de'ivery
Vagons there, and we put these in
; the middle of the road and blocked the
iroad Some time between 3 md 4
'.o'clock m the morning the car came
up and stopped, of course, and we
stepped out to see who it was. It
was Lawrence La Point and Dick
Walz. I stepped up on the running
tosrd and spoke to them and asked
' them what they were doing and where
they were from and they said Lord
burg. I asked them what this meant
He seemed excited and rattled a little
and said "did you konw Jim is - in
Lordsburg?"; he said '1 saw'him and
talked with him and these are his
gloves;" he said "Tom came up with
us." He was talking in Spanish. He
said "what are you going to do about
it?" I said "I don't know what I am
going to do about it." I said "I am
ieoine to satisfv mvself." I turned to
Vernon and said "what shallwe do;"
Vernon said "you are in charge."
"I won't work for a man and double
cross him. So I took my ugn off and
threw it in the garbage can. I said
"I have gone as far as I am going;"
I said "I am going to stay and see
these other cars." We pulled the
wagons out and let him go by, and
then put them back, and in 15 or 20
minutes another car went by: it was
jCody and Mike Sawaia the same fel
jlow I got with Pete Beruatto in Dun
Ican Cody was rattled and said "what
is up;" I said "there is nothing up;
! just going to break up the league and
see what is doing." He said "what
iare you going to do about it." I
turned to Vernon again and said
"what do you think." He said "you
are doing it and whatever you say
f:oes." I said "I have got myself in
n bad pace now; I ought to have ar
rested the first, bunch, and since I
Iave talien the action I have and let
one car go by it woudn't look right to
arrest the other."
"I won't work for anybody and
double cross them . "These are not the
I only guilty men; there are a lot more
of then around here doing the same
i stunt. Another car came on up be
jhind; he drove up probably 40 or 50
feet behind and stopped. It was pret
j ty light and I' looked back and it was
;Red Daley.
i Q. That is, Henry Daley? A.
j Henry Daley, yes. Cody said "what
;are you going to do; are you going to
jpull that wagon out of the road." I
I said "I don't know what I am going to
:do;" he said "this is all right, Dave."
I His car was all fastened up all around,
j I looked in all the cars . They were
lall heavily loaded between the seats.
Just as I said, under the circumstan
I ces, I felt that I was not the boss and
j I didn't want to take it upon myself
Vernon will tell you the action I took,
j I just pulled my gun off and threw it
I in the garbage can and said "I am
through."- Ii have come pretty near
! being run over two or three times

the ability of the men until further
practice is held.

pitcher and will "undoubtedly make
good with the future team.

!day afternoon and on Friday after
noon was one of the speakers at an
open air meeting held on Chase
Creek. J ,
Upon his 'arrival Mr. Donnelly an
nounced that Mr. Anton Johannesen,
International Organizer of the Carpen
ters Union, would arrive In Clifton on
Saturday evening and will remain here
several days. Lester M. noanA.Prpst.
jdent of the State Federation of La
,bor, will also arrive 'here on Monday
evening to assist in further union or
ganization work in the disrtict.
Vice President Donnelly - reports
the inauguration in the Globe-Miami
district of a "Labor Forward Move
ment" which will cover a period be
tween April 21 and May 6, in which
a united effort will be made by all
unions to increase their membership.
Donnelly reports the Miners Union in
Miami and Globe has been increased
by seven hundred and ' in addition
there has been an increase in member
ship in every class of trade..
In the opinion of Mr. Donnelly large
i employers in the state are endeavor
ing more than ever to try to under
stand the objects and purposes of or
ganized labor and. stated that he was
positive that when the large employ-
,ers thoroughly understood the con
structive policy of organized labor and
the fair mindedness of the same in the
state, they would be inclined to help
'rather than retard the movement.
I Mass Meeting
, At 5:30 o'clock this evening a mass
meeting was held at the Chase
Creek school which was largely at
tended, the Mexican element predomi
nating, with a sprinkling of Ameri
cans through the crowd. The eathr-
'ing was addressed by several speak
ers, among whom were J. L. Donaelly
P. P. Murray, G. de Larra and Sr

for the American Federation of La

terpreter and his address especially
pleased the Mexican people who . ac
corded him. prolonged cheers. In the
course of his remarks Mr. Murray
stated that it was his prediction that
within the next four years the Clifton
Morenci district would be graced with
three of the finest labor palaces in
the country, where the workers of the
district could hold their meetings and
have a home worthy of their efforts.
He also stated that for 24 years he
eight 'hours and that he would devote
the rest of his life in working for a
six-hour day, which was long enough
for any man underground to work.
In concluding his speech Mr. Murray
cautioned his hearers against outside"
agitators; that conditions at present
were excellent and without sufficient
cause for action to let things rest and
work hard for still better things; (he
wanted the co-operation of all laborers
in his work as organizer and through
their unity of purpose looked for con
ditions among themselves to be better
ed to a great extent.
Senor Luna was the next speaker
and at the conclusion of his remarks
J. L; Donnelly, vice president of the
State Federation of Labor, was given
a ihearty ovation. After stating the
object of the meeting Mr. Donnelly
confined his remarks to the subject
of the late strike and the course to
pursue by the union laborers of the
district in securing still better condi
tions for themselves. Mr. Donnelly
stated that his words were directed
more to the non-union men in the
crowd, if any were present.
I He heavily 'scored the latter for
coming into the district and getting
; jobs at $4 or $5 a day and then ridi
culing and making light of the union
men who had made the present
I wages possible. In his estimation
'they were to be treated with but
scant consideration. He also pointed
;out that the unions were scored for
their mistakes made at times. In
comparison he pointed out that the
press, church and state also - made
their mistakes and it was only
'through these errors in judgment that
they were able to rectify future ac
tions and thus reach the goal of their
'achievement perfection. Mr. Don
nelly said that the union movement
took no cognizance of race or color
but that all were working to a com
mon end betterment of the working-
man's condition the world over.
Organizer De Lara was the last
speaker of the evening and his re
ception was prolonged for some time
by the Mexicans. As usual his was
the speech they were anticipating
and that he did not disappoint them
in this instance was manifest by the
close attention and' frequent outbursts
of applause.
