BELIEVED DIZZINESS

Arrangements for the funeral of
X. S. Weiler, widely known jeweler,
who died at 12:10 o'clock yesterday
afternoon at his home, after an illness
of but a few hodrs duration, will be
made today on the arrival of William
C. HiiH of Carbondale, 111., father of
Mrs. Weiler.
Mrs. Weiler's brother, Samuel Till!,
of St. Louis, arrived in the Cape early
this morning and the family will an
nounce details for the funeral aftei
Mrs. Weiler has conferred with her
relatives.
Following the death of her husband
yesterday afternoon, Mrs. Weiler was
prostrated at her home, and she was
allowed to see but a f-.w intimate
friends. Her condition was not so
serious that it became necessary to
summon a physician to attend her.
however.
Mr. Weiler's death was caused, ac
cording to the physician who was sum
moned, by cerebral hemorrhage, caus
ed by the breaking of a blood vessel
in the brain.
The hemorrhage at first was believ
ed to be a severe attack of biliousness
with which he frequently had suffered
in the last few months. A physician
was not called until sometime after he
first became ill.
Tuesday night Mr. Weiler considered
himself in excellent condition. He
went home at 10 o'clock, and when he
arose from his bed early yesterday
morning, he commented to his wife
that he had not enjoyed such a re
freshing sleep in several nights.
Mrs. Weiler proceeded to prepare
breakfast and Mr. Weiler, after dress
ing, went into the bathroom at his
home at "2Sa South Spanish street, to
bathe his face.
He was just emerging from the bath
room when he suddenly was seized
with a dizzy spell. At the same time
he became sick and because breakfast
was not quite ready, he said he believ
ed he would lie down for a few
minutes.
He went to his bed, where he rested.
He was unable to rise for his break
fast and some time later he attempted
to get up to go to his store at 12C
Main street.
He was unable to leave the bed and
his condition became worse rapidly.
Mrs. Weiler summoned a physician,
who worked with Mr. Weiler and left
medicine for him.
About 9 o'clock Hugo Lang, Mr.
Weiler's assistant in the jewelry store,
called the Weiler home by telephone
and asked to speak to him. He was
told by Mrs. Weiler that Mr. Weiler
was too ill to go to the telephone,
whereupon she carried a message to
her husband concerning the location of
some electric lights that were to be
installed in the store.
Mr. Weiler replied that Mr. Lang
was to use his own judgment in plac
ing the lights.
A short time later he became un
conscious. The physician was sum
moned again and on his arrival about
noon, he was unable to do anything to
revive Mr. Weiler. Father F. J. Walsh
was called and administered the last
rites of the Catholic church. The end
came at twenty minutes to 1 o'clock.
Mrs. H. G. Cummins and Mrs. Wei
ler's sister, Miss Eva Hill, were with
Mrs. Weiler at the time he passed
away.
Mr. Weiler in the last few days had
considered his health excellent. More
than a month ago and a few days be
fore the big fire down town, Mr. Wei
ler suffered a serious attack of bilious
ness and stomach trouble that almost
proved fatal. He was confined to his
home for about three days and at one
time his physician abandoned hope of
his recovery. None of the medicines
that were given him brought relief.
His physician gave him. but a few
hours to live, but he finally obtained
relief.

BRIDGES GETS
ORDER TO FORM
GUARD COMPANY
Gen. Clark, Nevada, Mo.,
Wires He Wants Experien
ced Men and Officers.
MAY BE FIRST TO GO
TO MEXICAN BORDER
Angelo Dempsey, Dr. Vorbeck
and Maj. Houck Present
Arms for Roll-Call.
Captain Harry W. Bridges, formerly
a staff officer of the National Guard of
Missouri, yesterday afternoon received
a telegram from Genera! H. C. Clark,
of Nevada, Mo., commanding officer of
the National Guard organization in
this Stat?, asking him to organize a
company at once in this city and im
mediate vicinity.
Captain Bridges replied to General
Clark by wire as soon as lie had re
ceived the telegram, saying that he
would begin a canvass for guard mem
bers immediately.
Last night, six hours after he had
received the communication from Gen
eral Clark, a dozen men had signed a
list or indicated their willingness to
join the Guard company, and Captain
Bridges is optimistic over chances to
recruit a full company of l.r" men
within a couple of weeks.
The message that Captain Bridges
received was as fo'Iows:
"Can you organize and maintain
National Guard company quick, hav
ing majority experienced men and all
experienced officers. Vacancy. An
swer. H. C. Clark."
The demand for a company in the
Cape means the rejuvenation of the
Sixth Missouri Regiment, Bridges said
last night, and it will mean that the
men who join will have the first oppor
tunity of going to the Mexican border
in the event of mere serious war com
plication? and a demand for more
troops there, he declared.
"The War Department will fall back
upon the National Guard of the coun
try for men to send to the Mexican
border when the 'regulars' have been
called in," Bridges declared, "and it is
my opinion that the men who now join
the National Guard will have the first
opportunity to go to Mexico, if trouble
begins in earnest.
"As soon as 1 can obtain the names
of 100 men who are ready to form a
company with me, I shall communicate
with General Clark, who will, I antici
pate, authorize me to organize the
company.
"We shall select officers in the regu
lar way, acconimg to their merit, and
three ofTicers will be commissioned.
There will be six sergeants and cor
porals for each squad of eight men.
"Under the now army bill, the Na
tional Guard men serve in times of
peace and are paid from 4 to $16 a
month in accordance with the rank of
the member.
"The members of the guard," Cap
tain Bridges said, "may be called into
actual service only by volunteering for
United States service. A membership
in the National Guard does not neces
sarily mean war service, but it is prep
aration for war."
The age limits for the Guard com
pany are 18 to 45 years and those who
wish to enlist in the company are re
quested by Captain Bridges to commu
nicate with him.
Captain Bridges two years ago was
assigned to take charge of the former
National Guard company in the Cape,
which subsequently was disbanded in
a general re-organization of the State
National Guards.
Those who have signed or indicated
their desire to join a company are:
Major Giboney Houck, Captain H. W.
Bridges, Angelo Dempsey, Dr. J. C.
Vorbeck, Carl A. Powers, Louis Isch
Jr., L. G. Stovall, H. F. Allen, James
Davis, Carl Simpson, Thomas Sterling,
Bernie Sterling, Harry Hamilton and
Truman, a student in the Cape high
school.

WILLIAM BKUN'KHORST DID
NOT OPPOSE THE BOND ISSUE
Saloon Man Spent Day FLshing
Report of His Activity in Oppos
ing Bond Issue is Erroneous.
By confusing the given names of the
two Brunkhorst brothers, The Tribune
yesterday morning made it appear
that William Brunkhorst, the Broad
way saloon man, actively opposed the
bond issue for the fire department,
when a9 a matter of fact, it was
August Brunkhorst, the politician, who
joined Louis Witmor in his campaign
against the issue.

2 Year Old Tot
Runs Away And
Jars West End
Son of Mr. and Mrs. J. G.
Thompson Escapes From
Home at Night to Look for
Street Car Searching par
ty Finds Him.
Hoyt Thompson, the two-year-old
son of Mr. and Mrs. J. G. Thompson of
West William street, wandered away
from his home yesterday evening, and
for an hour his parents and two score
rf neighbors scoured that section of
the city for him.
He was found shortly after 8 o'clock
last night on North Henderson avenue,
looking for someone to play with.
Hoyt is a fat, chubby-iaced boy, who
makes friends with everyone he meets,
and he would just as soon be with a
stranger as anybody else. While Mrs.
Thompson was rocking Hoyt's baby
sister to sleep, he slipped out of the
front door and started east on Wil
liam street.
He was not missed for a long time.
Finally Mr. Thompson discovered that
his son was not in the house. Hurry
ing to the front door, he called for
Hoyt, but there was no response.
Without pausing to pick up his hat,
Mr. Thompson hurried out to look for
the youngster.
A number of little boys and girls
were at play near the corner of Wil
liam street and Louisiana avenue, but
Hoyt was not with them. Mr. Thomp
son inquired if the baby had been seen,
but he had not.
Then the search began. The two
small sons of Mrs. Selma Hirsch, who
live just across the street from the
Thompsons, volunteered to help find
the truant. A few minutes later tho
searching party had increased in size,
and nearly every small boy in the
neighborhood was finally scouring the
various streets for little Hoyt.
Mrs. Thompson turned her little
daughter over to the care of a neigh
bor and joined in the search for Hoyt.
Every pedestrian was stopped and
asked if they had seen a little fat boy
waddling along all by himself. No one
offered a clew.
A scouting expedition of boys found
the juvenile wanderer on Xorth Hen
derson avenue, while Mr. Thompson
was running down a rumor that he
may have gone due east on William
street.
The news of his capture spread as
rapidly as did the report that he had
escaped, and the excited parents were
overtaken by the good tidings before
they could overtake it.
Hoyt is a neighborhood favorite, but
he has one bad habit: Ho never over
looks an opportunity to look for a
street car, and while searching for one
yesterday he strayed from his own
bailiwick.
Tribune yesterday that he took no
action for or against the bond issue.
Instead of voting, he spent Tuesday
on the creek angling for bass and had
more luck than the bond issue.
"I never asked anyone to vote
against the bond issue," he said yes
terday. "As a matter of fact, I was
net opposed to it, although I Ud not
vote. I tooV the opportunity to go

OVERP
NOTE TO
Statesmen Say Wilson Should Have
Consulted Congress Before Send
in g Ultimatum to Germany
Others Oppose War.
PRESIDENT SAYS LAST WORD
HAS BEEN SENT TO BERLIN
"United States Will be Judge of
Germany's Acts in the Future,"
Is Declaration Made by Wilson
to Joint Meeting of Congress.
SPECIAL DISPATCH TO THE TRIBUNE
Washington, April P.). The reply from Germany to Piosident Wilson's
note, declaring the United States will break otF diplomatic relations unless
the present methods of Germany's submarine warfare are abandoned, is
eagerly awaited.
Lrp to a late hour tonight, no indication of what Berlin's reply would
be had been received. The situation has not leen us intense since the
beginning of hostilities in Europe.
Members of both houses of Congress are divided over the President's
course . Some contend that he should have informed Congress before send
ing a virtual ultimatum to Germany. The opinion is held by some that
that the United States is not justified in going to war, and a resolution
probably will be introduced to that effect tomorrow.
President Wilson's message to the joint session of Congress this after
noon was received with uncanny -;lence. Senators and Congressmen
listened to everv word the President uttered.
The strong part of President Wil
rcn's message to Congress says:
"That point has now unhappily been
reached. The facts are succertible of
but one interpretation. The Imperial
German Government has been unable
to put any limits or restriction upon
its warfare against either freight or
passenger ships. It has thorefoie be
come painfully evident tint the posi
tion which thi.j Government took at
the very outset is inevitable, namely,
that the use of submarines for the
destitution of an enemy's commerce
is of necessity because of the very
character of the vessels employed and
the very methods of attack which tiieir
employment of course involves iricom-
.atible with the principles of humani
ty, the long-established and incontro
vertible rights of neutrals, and the
sacred immunities of no.icombatants.
"I have deemed it my duty, there
fore, to say to the German Imperial
Government that if it is still its pur
pose to prosecute relentless and in
discriminate warfare against vessels ;
of commerce by the use of submarine,
notwithstanding the now demonstrated
impossibility of conducting that war
fare in accordance with what the Gov
ernment of the United States must
consider the sacred and indisputable
rules of international law and the
universally recognized dictates of hu
manity, the Government of the United
States is at last forced to the conclu
sion that there is but one course it can
pursue; and that unless the Imperial
German Government should now im
mediately declare and etfect an aban
donment of its oresent methods of
warfare against passenger and freight
carrying vessels, this Government can
have no choice but to sever diplomatic
relations with the Government of the
German Empire altogether.
"This decision I have arrived at with
the keenest regret, the possibility of
the action contemplated I am sure all
thoughtful Americans will look for
ward to with unaffected reluctance.
But we cannot forget that we are in
some sort and by the force of circum
stances the responsible spokesmen of
the rights of humanity, and that we
cannot remain silent while those rights
seem in process of being swept utterly
away in the maelstrom of this terrible
war. We owe it to xi due regard for
our own rights as a nation, to our
sense of duty as a representative of
the rights of neutrals the world over,
and to a just .conception of the right.'
FLIT
of mankir.d to take this stand now
with the utmost solemnity and frank
ness. "I have taken it and taken it in the
confidence that it will meet with your
approval and support. All sober
minded men must unite in hoping that
the Imperial German Government,
which has in other circumstances stood
as the champions of all that we arc
now contending for in the interest of
humanity, may recognize the justice of
our demands and meet them in the
spirit in which they are made."
Bitter comment fell from the lips
of Republican Loader Mann.
"It is a hypocritical speech, probably
for campaigning purposes." lie said.
"The President has been pro-Kng!ish
r.ll during the controversy. I said at
the time of the McLemore resolution
that the President wanted to g"t us
into war with Germany, and I saw the
5,a;ne thing now."
"President Wilson i.; a Scotch Pres
byterian and lie hates the Dutch."
Mann added.
Among Democratic leaders, indorse
ment of the President's speech was
general, though House Leader Kitchin
withheld his views, saying he wi!id
to wait for a mental cooling before
discussing matters.
Copenhagen, April If. It was an
nounced tonight that the German and
Austrian chancellors have reached an
important decision relating to rn
economic war against the Allies. Xo
intimation as to what the decision is
has be,en revealed.
London, Aprl 1!. An Athens dis
patch says the Liberals, led by Former
Premier Vonizelos, have decided to
contest all vacancies in the chamber of
deputies.
London. April 19. The Government
has decided to prohibit all meetings
that are liable to lead to disorders.
Peace meetings will come under this
order.
London, April 19. The Germans
have renewed their bombardment
along the whole fiont north of Verdun.
They apparently are preparing for
another attack in the Dead Man Hill
region. Only infantry action was
reported today southeast of Verdun,
where the Germans landed three at
tacks against the French. At Les
Eparges the assaults failed.
The Germans claim further gains
south of Hauremont Farm in the
Vaux district.
