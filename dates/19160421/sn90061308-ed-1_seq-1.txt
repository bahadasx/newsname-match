SUBMARINE WARFARE
MUST CEASE SAYS
PRESIDENT WILSON
President Announces His Action in
Verbal Message to Congress Ac
tion is Received with Appro
bation by the Members of
. House and Senate
Washington, April 19. President
Wilson's long-evpected final warning
to Germany that the United States
will break off diplomatic relations un
less she abandons her present meth
ods of submarine warfare and imme
, diately declares her intention to do so,
was delivered today in a note to Ber
lin and was announced by the presi
dent in an address to a joint session
of congress. The president demands
nothing less than the abandonment of
submarine warfare against commerce.
Both the president's address and
the American note declare in unequiv
ocal terms that only by Germany ac
ceding to the demand can the break
ing off of relations altogether be per
vented. , The president considers that the
next step depends solely upon Ger
many, and that three or four days is
to constitute a reasonable time for a
: reply. He is willing to discuss how
submarine warfare may be conducted
j within the limits, ,of international law
land humanity after5 Germany aban
dons her present methods.
f- Diplomatic history records but one
1 instance as yet where a breaking of
relations between two first-class pow-
era has not eventually brought war
'that which now exists between Ger
many and Italy.
i Congress received the president's
declaration of his course with mixed
. evidences of concern and approbation.
Most of the leaders, democratic and
frepublican, thought the president
hardly could do less, and some ex
pressed the opinion that Ms action
would not lead, to war. -
