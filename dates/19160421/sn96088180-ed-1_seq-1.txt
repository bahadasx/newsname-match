Chihuahua City, April 21. A ban-
dlt whoso life was spared by his cap
tors has pointed out the lonely grave
in the mountains supposed to contain
the body of Francisco Villa, it was
stated In advices received today, but
the corpse when exhumed was de
clared not to be that of the' bandit
chief. Other reports to United States
Consul Letcher asserted Villa is un
wounded and is in the state of
Durango.
.. The general in charge of the cuar
tel here announced today that he had
received a Carransa order, dated Sat
urday, prohibiting aviators from fly
ing over cities and barring the Amer
ican expedition from using telegraphs
and telephones. '
Carranza soldiers and citizens fired
a volley at an army flyer Wednesday.
At first he appeared to be attempting
to land here, but later he flew toward
San Antonio. It was believed he
came from Satevo.
Resentment of both soldiers and
populnre agalnBt continued presence
of the expedition In Mexico has be
come so general that the Carranzlstas
doclare they will soon be unable to
control the people 'unless the Ameri
can troops are withdrawn. Jetcher
reported that the fight at Parral was
not an Isolated case. He heard that

tho expedition were believed to have
occurred. I

San Antonio, April 21. General
Pershing withdrew the advanced de
tachment of the American expedition
in order to save it from possible mas
sacre at the hands of Carranzlatu,
according to staff officers at army
headquarters today. Tbe expedition
la stalled. Future activities depend
upon tbe conference between Gen
erals Scott and Funston here. The
contents of Pershlng'a reports were
not ' revealed,' but It Is understood
they detailed the Carranzlstas' atti
tude.
Columbus, N. M., April 21. The
lull In tbe American expedition's
Mexican operations extends to the
local camp today. Few supplies were
sent forward. Only hospital supplies
and ambulances came In from El
Paso.
A battalion of the 24th Infantry de
trained here today. They are the
yaflguard of the 2,300 reinforcements
which General Funston Is sending to
strengthen the lines of communica
tions.
Aviators are testing five new mill
tary aeroplanes. Onlyi two of the
original eight planes which entered
Mexico are still In condition. They

death of Villa, as having any founda
tion," said General Gutierrez. In
fact, I do not know whether Villa Is
alive or dead. ' For days I have been
unable to secure anything definite
with regard to his whereabouts."
Gutierrez would not comment on
a report that he was preparing a pro
test against an American aviator
flying around Chihuahua Wednesday.
1 Letcher's reports said that Villa
was probably not in the Guerrero
battle) at which he was said to have
been wounded.
The newspapers have already an
nounced an early retirement of the
American expedition. "El Demo
crata" printed a Washington dispatch
saying that the United States had de
clared war on Germany and that.lt
needed all its forces to fight the Teu
tons. Another article stated that Sec
retary Lansing was studying plans
for an early withdrawal. This article
gave Carranza credit for halting the
American advance.
' Concentration of Carranzlstas at
Parral and south of Parral Is appar
ently to oppose the Americans who
may attempt to march southward.
Mayor . Herrera of Parral was In
structed to Inform the Americans that
they must not advance beyond Par
ral. General Luis Herrera, whose
brother-in-law, Colonel Orozco, was
killed in the Parral Incident, has
gone to that city. It Is understood
that 2,000 Carranzlstas from the

1 Paso, April zi. An uncon
firmed report from mining sources
stated today that 200 Carranzlstas
bad been killed In an attack by 8an-
uto Reyes and his Vllllstas npon de
facto troops under General Trevlno
between Torreon and Saltlllo. Gen
eral Gavlra discredited the story.
"Mexico for Mexicans," Is believed
to be tbe object of again making
public tbe order deporting all for
eigners antagonistic to the de facto
government. '
Consul Garcia today made public
a message from General Ooregon,
Mexican war minister, expressing a
hope that "our national and Interna
tional difficulties will soon be over
come."
Garlca also announced that the
government would establish a gold
basis In the Juarex customs house
May 1. If the Importers can not pay
gold and sell goods for depreciated
silver and paper money, its imports
will stop if the order Is put Into exe
cution. Some charge that the de facto re
gime Is trying to placate the Mexi
cans' dissatisfaction with economic
and Internal conditions by opposing
the American expedition. Ant!
foreign orders are similarly Inter
preted. It was reported that famine
had caused much recent banditry.

VOH IGEL'S PAPERS
Washington, April 21. The seri
ousness with which the German em
bassy regards Belzure of Wolf von
Igel's papers by secret service agents
was revealed today when Counsellor
Hatzfeldt, accompanied by an attor
ney, called at the state department
and demanded their return. This is
the fifth time the documents tave
been aBked for verbally, and there
have been three written demands.
The papers are said to throw light
on alleged German propaganda work
in the United States. They were
taken when von Igel, formerly secre
tary to Captain Franz von Papen,
when the latter was a German em
bassy attache, was arrested in New
Tork in connection with a govern
ment bomb plot probe.
Ambassador von Bernstorff ia in
New York, presumably in the same
connection. Whether the state de
partment's proposal that the papers
be submitted to von Bernstorff for
him to select those which are prop
erty of the embassy will be accepted
by the ambassador ,1s not known. He
has demanded all the documents and
all the photographs and photographic
plates which have been made of them
by the United States district attorney.
The trap results from von Bern-
storff's desire to reclaim the docu
ments as embassy papers and yet not
admit officially that they are the prop
erty of himself or the embassy. If
the embassy' refuses papers involving
criminal propaganda, the govern
ment is free to use them. The docu
ments and the evidence of von der
Goltz are believed to show that Cap
tains von Papen and Boy-Ed, recalled
embassy attaches, were not the
"highest up" men In the alleged pro
paganda plots. Von der Goltz In his
statement declared that von Bern
storff quashed an alleged plan to in
vade Canada.

Arrest cf Fcnner Secretary
to yon Papen bd Seizure
Washington, April 21. German
Ambassador von Bernstorff has been
caught In a itrap from which he can
not escape if the Interpretation placed
here today on the last few days' de
velopments proves correct " '' .
The situation was brought about
by the arrest of Wolf von Igel, form
er secretary to Captain von Papen.
recalled German embassy attache, on
bomb plot charges In New York, and
the seizure of his papers by secret
service agents. Washington has con
cluded that the '' German embassy
faces the" necessity of admitting Im
proper activities or having the facts
proved against it " Whether von
Bernstorff can show that Washing
ton is wrong remains to be seen.'
'Von Igel's papers form the prin
cipal basis for this belief. The con
fession of Horet Ton der Goltz, the
kaiser's alleged secret 'agent, now In
custody in this country, is another
element. The cabinet has consider
ed the situation. ' The department
of Justice and the state department
have been considering it for several
days. How seriously the German em
bassy viewed . it was shown when
eight demands were made for the re
turn of von Igel's papers and for the
photographic copies of them taken
by the United States district attor
ney's office.
It was freely predicted that von
Bernstorff might be handed bis pass
ports for reasons independent of tho
submarine controversy. " v...'
STOP CAMPAIGNING
OF
Washington, April 21. America
in its note to Berlin demands an im
mediate, stop to the present submar
ine campaign against merchant ships.
When this ia halted the way will ho
clear to settle the question of how
submarines ,' may proceed against
commerce without further' endanger
ing friendly relations between-the
United States and Germany.
This was made clear today in point
ing out that the United States will
not be satisfied' with assurances that
Germany will operate within " tho
beunds previously drawn namely,
adequate warning to all doomed ships
and assured safety for the passengers.
Germany's present campaign must
be discontinued until the two govern
ments can decide what is practicable
and legal in the way of conducting
submarine operations against enemy
commerce. By the term "immediate"
in the note the president meant with
in a time sufficient for the submarine
commanders to be notified to cease
their activities.
Grave danger now lies in a possible
attack upon a neutral vessel, particu
larly it there chances to be an Ameri
can on board. In such an event,
Germany must show that the sub
marine commander failed to receive
his orders to quit, or a break would
be practically automatic.
