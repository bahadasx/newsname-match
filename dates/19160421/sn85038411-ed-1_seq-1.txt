By Associated Press
El Paso, Texas, April 21. —Move-
ments of American troops from points
along the border to the army base at
Columbus, N. M., where they will be
held In readiness to reinforce General
Pershing's army in case of necessity,
continued to-day. Dispatches from
the front indicated that American
troops were awaiting developments at
Washington before making any fur
ther effort 1o capture Villa.
Officials of the de facto government
said there was no basis for the reports
that uprisings were Imminent in north
ern Durango and lower Chihuahua. It
was explained at Juarez that the move
ment of the Carranza troops into the
Parral district was not intended as a
Ihreat to bar the further advance of
the American forces, but that the
dt: facto soldiers had been sent there
to preserve order and prevent destruc
tion of private property.
Andres Garcia, Mexican consul, said
to-day that the work of the American
expedition was concluded and that he
hoped that in a few days the order
would come from Washington for the
troops to be withdrawn.
"We have the situation in hand,"
: said Mr. Garvin. "The Villa cause is
broken, and if Villa still lives his pres
tige is destroyed."
Air. Garcia said the government on
the first of next month will demand
that all import and export duties be
paid in gold. The Mexican consul did
not credit the reports that the law de
manding gold for such duties would
create trouble.
