Probably the oldest horseshoer
in Nodaway county, if not in the
United States, is Josiah Collins.
Mr. Collins was 90 years old on
Friday, Maroh 10, 1916. He was
born in Ohio and commenoed the
blaokamithing business when 19
years old and shod his first horse
at that age. He made the re
mark a short time before his
birthday that if he lived he ex
pected to shoe a horse or a mule,
no matter how unruly the animal
might be, on his 90th birthday,
and he kept his word. Parnell

Iron Mountain railroad will in the
near future begin the work of
erecting a $20,000 passenger and
freight depot in Sikeston. Ac
cording to the information we
have, the new building will be
ereoted on the company's plat of
ground just north and west of
the present station. It will be
of brick, covered with tile, and
will have ample accomodations
for both passenger and freight.
It will be modern in every re

The Rothvilla Bee wonders if
the housewives who gave orders
to the peddler last week for 10
cent bath (owela have received
their allotment yet? The scheme
however, gained admittance- to
nearly every home. The peddler
invested a dollar In the purchase
of a couple of fine bath . towels
from the looal merchants. These
he swung on his arm and the
tempting offer of a 50o bath towel
tor lOo did the work. Suob bar
gains in sight, what must be the
packs he carried? Of kourse he
sold his goods at a good round
price, but the towels he told
would be shipped to there and
thsy could pay or them - at that
time. ,. f v
Many Persons Poisoned By
Headache Powders.
Headache powders have a tre
mendous sale throughout the
United States. They are taken
almost entirely without the ad
vice of a physician, being freely
advertised In street cars and ot
her publio places and sold with
out hindrance at the average
drug store. . v"''
Almost all headache powders
contain one of three or four ooal
produots, such as acetanilid, an
tipyrin and phenaoetin, aooord
ing to Dr. M. P. Ravenel of the
department of preventive medi
cine of the University of Missouri.
While these vary somewhat in
their poisonous properties, all of
them produoe similar eff acta in
over-doses or when taken over a
long period of time. They gen
erally affect the heart and circu
lation, and perhaps the most com
mon symptom of poisoning by
these drugs is bluenees of the
skin, affecting first the lips and
mouth, the nails and finger tips,
but if taken in larger doses the
skin of the whole body, It is
oaused by destructive changes in
the blood whioh are serious and
are always followed sooner or
later by pallor, shortness of
breath, palpitation of the heart,
musoular weakness and disincli
nation to exertion.
Up to the end of 1907 there
were 855 cases of poisoning with
26 deaths reoorded, due to these
drugs. Inquiries made by the
Department of Agriculture of the
United States obtained from 400
physicians the records of 814 ad
ditional oases of poisoning with
29 deaths. In addition to this
many people acquire the habit,
the greatest number of these be
ing due to acetanilid, so that up
to the end of 1908 we had already
collected 1,609 cases of poisoning
with 55 deaths, and 169 cases of
drug habit. These inquiries also
showed thBt in a great majority
of cases the remedy was taken
for headftche. This is especially
true of acetanilid. We have also
reoords of a number of cases of
poisoning in which acetanilid had
been used as a local remedy or
iressing for cases of burns and
other injuries.
The worst feature of this whole
businesi is that the advertise
ments almost invariably claim
that these headache remedies are
free from danger, and the unaus
peoting person takes them with
out any suspicion of the risk he
is running.
The lesson is a plain one. The
sale of these drugs should be re
stricted by law, and until this is
brought about,! persons should
not take this class of drugs ex
cept on the advice and under the
guidance of a competent phyei
oian. The old adage should be
remembered that "he who treats
himself has a fool for a physician
and a fool for a patient."
In the Howell oounty Cirouit
Court last week Calvin Rus

monial venture was his fifth one,

his fourth wife was illegal.
Stockmen in a sohool district
of Howell oounty have organized

Some so called nursery sales
men. Operating in Missouri are
making promises that seem too
good to be" true... The Missouri
Agricultural Experiment Station
wisfce to warn farmers and fruit
growers to be very careful about
investing in Btook of an unknown
variety of supposed special merit
and against signing contracts to
buy arid grow fruit trees, vines,
or other nursery stock on the
Btrengthof promises that it can
be sold later at very high prioes.
. : Buyers should require the nur
sery salesmen to show the epe
otal permits whioh the law re
quires! them to, secure from the
Chief Inspector of Nurseries ! and
Oroharda. Salesmen ' who can
not sh$w such permits should be
reported at once to the Experi
ment Station at Columbia for In
vestigation, but the honesty of
those who do have euoh permits
cannot be guaranteed by the Ex
periment Station, altho there is a
strong presumption that the men
who have oomplied with the law
by taking out permits will be
much more likely to be honest
and straightforward than the
man who is selling in violation of
the law.!
The1 exhibition of such a . per
mit shows that the agent is regis
tered tor the sale and distribution
of etook which has been inspect
ed and found free from danger
ous inaoots and diseases. There
are plenty of responsible agents
in the state representing respon
sible nurseries and orders can be
plaoed by mail with nurseymen
who will look after the interests
of their oustomers honestly. So
with a little care the buyer can
get exactly what he wishes with
out dealing with questionable
parties. He should order stand
ard varieties whioh he knows are
doing well in his locality and re
fuse the fancy varieties which he
knows are doing well iu his local
ity and refuse the fanoy varieties
on whioh fabulous profits are
promised. L. Ha9eman, Chief
Inspector of Nurseries and Or
chards, Columbia, Missouri.
We Have The Cows. '.
Southeast Missouri has so
many natural advantages that
one may never have thought
about the possibilities of dairy
ing. We not only have mild win
ters, abundant feed, a long pas
ture season, good markets, but
we have some wonderful cows. .
Official tests have just been
completed at Sikeston, Mo., in
whioh one cow two years old pro
duced in thirty days 65.9 pounds
of butter fat. If this had been
made into butter, it would be 69.9
pounds, or 2 1-8 pounds of butter
a day. ..) During this test this cow
gave 1830 pounds of milk, or an
average of 7,1-2 gallons of milk
a day for thirty days.
Another cow, Konigen Paul
ine Royal 130850, in twenty five
days gave 60.14 pounds of butter
fat and 1424.4 pounds of milk.
Stated in pounds of butter, this
would be three pounds of butter
a day for twenty-five days.
There is no guess work about
such reoords. A disinterested
party is present at every milking,
weighs and tests all milk drawn
and swears to the statements
made. .
. These cows are Holsteina and
belong to the dairy herd of L. D.
Baker, of Sikeston. A number
of other cows in this same herd
are being tested And Mr. Baker
is confident that these reoords
will be broken.

Hessian Fly.
This is the season of the year
when some farmers will be ser
iously considering plowing up
their wheat because ef the large
amount of fly present, and be
cause so muoh of the wheat ap
pears dead. It is very hard to
tell at this time just what euoh
wheat will do. Fall injury from
the fly inoreases stooling and
with favorable weather, fields
with apparently large amounts of
dead wheat thicken up and show
a very good stand by harvest.
Further injury from the fly in
the fields where it wintered is not
certain to ocour, as they often
migrate to other fields.
The Hessian Fly is now in the
pupa state and is easily found by
looking behind the leaf sheath
near the surfaoe of the ground.
Oreat numbers will be crowed to
gether and somewhat' resemble
flax seeds; henoe the pupa is of
ten spoken of as the flax seed
state. As soon as danger of frost
is over, the adults oome from
these pupa and deposit eggs on
the upper leaves of the growing
wheat. The larva from these
eggs will do all the injury that
the fly will yet do to this crop.
These larva feed at the joints and
weaken the stalk so that the heads
fall oVer before harvest. Suoh
injury is easily distinguished
from the ( jnjury done by the
wheat ' joint, worm which pauses
crooked stalks of wheat. v If no
hard wind or storm occurs just
before harvest, the damaged
wheat is often ou; before falling
over.
Plowing up wheat. ought to.be
delayed as long as possible. On
can hardly deoide in time to plant
corn. .If the wheat is actually
dead, we will have time to plant
some crop like cow peas or soy
beans. Seth Babcock.
Offioers with a search warrant
searched a car-load of junk at
Charleston last week looking for
brass that had been stolen from
a threshing maohine, but failed
to find the stolen property.
John Nash, of Parma, Mo., was
instantly killed one day last week
while dynamiting stumps along
the country road. Thinking a
fuse had been distinquishnd, he
went baok to re-touch it, but the
fuse was burning and the explo
sion followed as he bent forward
to investigate. He was blown to
atoms.
"Who says Moniteau county
hasn't wide awake offioers?"
asks the California Democrat,
defiantly. Recently the olrcuit
judge, deputy collector, sheriff
and treasurer went before the
utilities commission at Jefferson
City to Bhow reasons why the
Missouri Paoifio's "No. 6" should
stop at California. They put up
suoh a good argument that they
got results.
Will Huddleeton, of Rover,
Oregon oounty, was bound over
to circuit oourt last week,, for
shooting and injuring a young
lady at a dance in Oregon county
a few , weeks ago. The young
woman had refused his attentions
at the dance and later he ap
peared at a window and fired
four shots into the room from a
revolver, three going' wild - and
one striking Miss Pearl Hawkins.

Mr. Holmes announced, he had re

Crucible Steel company at Midland,
Pa., following a test of a plate made
at the United States testing grounds,
at Sandy Hook, a short time ago.
, The plate in question waa 23 teat
