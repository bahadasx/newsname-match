FLORAL CROSSES
IN N. P. DINERS ON
EASTER SUNDAY
Railway Company Also Has Ordered
Hens to Lay Special Assortment
of Eggs for Patrons.
Easter will be fittingly observed
aboard Northern Pacific dining cars
this year with large floral crosses in
each car. This is said to be the first
time a transcontinental railway has
placed such an emblem in its trains
at Easter time.
From the Pacific Coast to St. Paul
these crosses will grfeet the eyes of
dining car patrons aboard Northern
Pacific trains, and the interiors of
all dining cars will be bedecked with
Easter lilies. Careful selections of
the flowers to be used have been made.
In anticipation of the natural desire
among passengers to partake of eggs
Easter morning, Northern Pacific
farm hens have been called upon for
an additional supply. Chefs will pre
pare them in novel styles and in a
variety of colors.
"PYRENE"
The Pyrene extinguisher for motor
cars is known all over the United
States. It can be relied upon to kill
the most stubbon automobile blaze,
no matter where it is, quickly and
without damage to engine or car. A
few well-directed Bhots from a Py
rene Extinguisher sent at the flames
instantly smother the fire.
The Pyrene extinguisher is easily
operated and may be refilled as read
ily as a kerosene lamp.
Motorists can purchase Pyrene from
all automobile supply dealers, and at
hardware stores.
Pyrene will not hurt your motor,
woodwork or clothes. Remember
that water spreads gasoline fires.

FRONTIER DAYS
IS FULL OF FUN
Those who did not attend the
"Frontier Days" celebration at the
armory, staged by the Knights of
Pythias, Wednesday night or last
night, missed something mighty good.
There's a chance for these absent
minded citizens tonight and tomorrow
night, however, and there will be
fully as much fun, possibly more.
Dance floor, soft drink bar and
country store are keen attractions,
and many amusing stunts are pulled
off at these places. The voting con
test for the most popular woman in
the city is exciting much interest,
and the prizes, gas range, electric
stand lamp and $7 pair of shoes, are
worth striving for. Votes are bought
with stage money.
SAWMILLS WASTE PRODUCT
The waste product of sawmills in
the United States, including that fed
to furnaces as fuel, is estimated to
be 36,000,000 cords per year, and the
equivalent of 2,880,000,000 cubic feet
of solid wood substance. About half
of it has no use whatever, but is us
ually burned to get rid of it.

Paul Steele of Tacoma, was given

Three Stages Are
Found in Campaign
Against Mortality
State Board of Health Bulletin Shows
Risks in Childhood, Early Man
hood and Middle Age
In planning our campaign against
' deaths between the ages of two and
| fifty we may divide our work into
' three periods, namely, from two to 14,
1 14 to 35 and from 35 to 50, says a
press bulletin of the Washington state
I board of health.
| Between the ages of two and 15 we
have to contend with the so-called dis-
I eases of childhood, such as scarlet
fever, diptheria, measles, whooping
cough, etc. .We are now giving much
attention to scarlet fever and diph
theria, but little attention is paid to
measles and whooping cough. The re
sult is that measles is killing more
people in our state than is scarlet
! fever. In this we do not differ from
, other states, but Washington does not
| want to be like other states, we want
I to be better than other states.
I Measles is killing more people than
is scarlet fever, not because it is a
more severe disease, but because we
look on it as a harmless disease and
allow children to be exposed to it
. when we would take great care to
i protect them from scarlet fever or
diphtheria. The same is true, only

whooping cough is killing more people
than is measles and for the same rea

is scarlet fever.
If we are going to reduce our death
rates between the ages of two and 15
we must immediately begin to treat
measles and whooping cough with just
as much respect as we do scarlet fever
, and diphtheria. To accomplish this a
large amount of educational work will
be required.
In our next period, from 15 to 35,
we have to contend chiefly with that

disease which should not be allowed
to exist in any civilized community,
namely, typhoid fever. Typhoid is
practically eradicated from our cities,
but it continues to claim its quota ot
victims as a result of infections in
rural districts.
To eradicate this disease from rural
districts is simply a problem of edu
cation. Its eradication is not an ex
pensive problem, it is simply a matter
of attention to details. Clean lumber
cainps, clean road camps, clean rail
road construction camps and clean
farms together with protection of our
streams from pollution will eliminate
this death dealing disease from our
state.
Then in our next period, from 35 to
50 we have to deal with those insidi
ous diseases of the kidneys and blood
vessels. It is not so much a matter
of preventing these diseases as of de
tecting them in time to cure them.
Very few people suspect either of
these diseases until they are far ad
vanced.
How frequently people learn that
they have well advanced disease of
the heart or kidneys only when they
are examined for life insuarnce. These
people think they are well, though
when they come to think of it, they
have not been feeling quite up to
standard for some time, in fact that
is what induced them to take out the
life insurance. Had they been exam
ined a year or two years before the
disease would have been detected and
cured very probably by simply regu
lating the diet.
If these diseases are to be combat-

WOLVES KILL CATTLE
The annual losses of. livestock on
the national forest ranges of the West,
due to predatory animals, are over
$500,000. An organized campaign is
now on to exterminate these animals.
Wolves are responsible for about 70
per cent of the cattle losses, white
bears cause most of the remainder.
Approximately 75 per cent of the
sheep losses are due to coyotes, 20
per cent to bears, and 5 per cent to
lynxes and wild cats. Mountain lions
