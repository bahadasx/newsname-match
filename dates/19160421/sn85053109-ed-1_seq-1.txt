CUT BANK, TETON COUNTY, MONTANA, FRIDAY, APRIL 21, 1 9 1 6.
Two Dollars Per Yea
Plenty Money for
the County Roads
Goodly Sum will be Spent
On the Roads In
This Section
The last session of the county
commissioners was devoted
principally to road matters. The
county was divided into three
road districts, according to Com
missioner Jacobson. The super
visors of these districts will be
provided with complete road
making equipment, will have
cook wagons and sleeping quar
ters and will devote their time
exclusively to the work during
the season best suited for such
improvement. Andrew Teterud
will be the supervisor for this
section. Mr. Jacobson states
that the county road fund now
totals about $30,000 and that by
October first the amount will
be double that sum. So Teton
county is not lacking for funds
and it is to be hoped that the
very best results will be gotten
from the money expended.
Residents of the section north
of Headlight are very anxious
to have the highway known as
the Cut Bank-Sweet Grass road
from south of the N. L. Oikle
ranch to where it joins the
Sweet Grass east-and-west road
improved this summer and
Commissioner J a c o b s on has
given assurances that consider
able time and money will be
spent in improving this impor
tant roadway. Martin Edwards,
Jonas Vasboe and other active
citizens out that wav are now
circulating a petition praying
that this road be given due at
tention. As it is one of the
most important roads leading
to Cut Bank, it is to be hoped
the other commissioners will be
in accord with Mr. Jacobson in
the matter of making needed
improvements on this road.
Other roads in the Cut Bank
community will be given due
attention and we hope to see a
big improvement in our high
ways at the close of the season.

Leu Fox is down with Small Pox

Browning. He is past the crisis,
and is doing well.
A large number have been vac
cinated as a precaution, in s;ite of
the arguments thai are ofteu used
against this form of prevco ion. Sia
tistic8 seem to prove overwhelming
ly that it greatly lessens the inten
sity of the attack on the individual,
and prevents the spread of the
loathsome contagion. So au ounce
of prevention is belter than a ton
of cure. Good huiue-training is
better, morally, than many peni
tentiaries. It even seems to beat
hanging, as a means of cuiing a
man of defects and starting him
out on a new career in this world.
It surpasses war. too, as a means of
settling quesiions of international
morality. Nations need homes, and
home training, under the right sort
of fathers aud mothers, more than
anything else. Could we have these
factors crimes and wars would be
largely a thing o the past. Train
up a child in the way he should go",
etc. That would be a fine question
for debate in our schools;
llesolved, '"That Prevention is
better than cure".
Another good debate could be
nulled off in our agricultural col
leges and farmers institutes, as
well as in town councils,, on the
theme:-Resolved, ''That an ounce of
fact is better thau a train-load of
theory".

Reserve Opening
Now Seems Sure
All Opposition to Walsh
Measure Seems
Removed
If the reports that have been
coming from Washington the
past week can be given credence,
the Walsh special act to open
the eastern edge of the Black
feet Reservation to settlement
will pass without opposition.
It is said that Sen. Lane, the
most persistent opponent of the
measure, is now satisfied with
the terms under which the land
is tu be disposed of and that
Bob Hamilton, a Lane protege,
has come over in favor of the
Walsh plan.
Malcolm Clark, who has been
leading the fight in favor of the
plan as a representative of the
Reservation people, reports that
the outlook is most favorable at
this time. He has been keep
ing James A. Perrine and others
informed as to developments.
The feeling at Browning and
other Reservation points is that
the matter is practically settled.
It is probable that after the
Walsh bill passes, if it does, it
will take about a year to adjust
matters satitactorily. The open
ing will probably occur about a
year from this spring.
Malcolm Clark has spent the
past couple of months at Wash
ington, making a hard fight for
the Walsh bill. He has been
under heavy expense. Mr.
Perrine informed Cut Bank cit
izens of this fact last week and
immédiat ely.with the assistance
of P. B. Anderson, a campaign
to reimburse him for his outlay
was begun and nearly $390.00
was raised, in about as many
hours.
The Cut Bank Wilson Club at
its meeting April 17 adopted the
following resolutions:
"Resolved—That we endorse
the administration of President
Wilson. We commend him to
the people of the United States
as being honest, upright and
fearless in the discharge of the
duties of the high office of Pres
ident and we pledge our support
to him for re-nomination and
re -election. We further resolve
that we endorse the work of our
Senators and Congressmen in
the support thev have given the
President in all of his policies.
"Resolved—That we heartily
endorse the re-nomination of
Governor Stewart and commend
him to the people for re-elec
tion."

Klein-Stray er
On Wednesday evening of
this week Justice Frank Van
Demark united in marriage Paul
Klein and Miss Anna J. Strayer,
both of Pleasant Valley. The
v itnesses were Joe Danens and
Miss Mary Strayer. Mr. and
Mrs. Klein left town the same
evening, for the ranch of the
groom, where they will make
their home.
The bride and gxoom o f
Wednesday are among the most
popular residents of the Pleas
ant Valley section. Mr. Klein
has resided here for a number
of years and is known as a
young man of exceptional in
tegrity and thrift. The bride has
also been a resident here for
three or four years and is a
most estimable young woman.
Mr. and Mrs. Klein begin their
wedded life under most favor
able auspices and their many
good friends hope that their
happiness may be nnmarred in
the years to come.
Many Promotions
There will be a number of
changes in the railway service
on May first, affecting two or
three of the local boys. On that
date Gus Anderson, for many
years roundhouse foreman here,
will be promoted to the position
of traveling engineer on t h e
Montana division, with head
quarters at Havre. He will be
succeeded b y James Malone,
long a local machinist and one
of the most popular men that
ever held a position in J i m
Hill's round house here. F.
Plank, one of our dry-farmer
raiiroaders, has also been pro
moted to traveling engineer on
the Kaiispell division. "Dutch
Shule, for many years travel
ing engineer on the Montana
run, will on the above date be
come one of the "higher-ups,"
being promoted to master me
chanic.
Foreman Anderson, in con
versation with the writer one
day this week, stated that there
was no question concerning the
contemplated i m p r o vements
here and said he felt certain
that the enlaigement of t h e
roundhouse and other improve
ments would be made early in
the summer.
Roads and Land Values
As the result of the stndy of
650 farms in Johnson County,
Missouri, by the state experi
ment stations, interesting evi
dence of the money value of
good roads to the farmer was
adduced. The investigation
was for the purpose of deter
mining the relative importance
of crop yield and location in
fixing farm values. The Ex
Deriment Station concludes that
location is more important than
yield as a factor in values.
The figures on which it bases
this conclusion are:
Seventy-nine farms within
two miles of Uiarket averaged
$78.70 an acre; 183 farms, two
to four miles from market,
$70.20 an acre; 125 farms, four
to six miles from market,
$60.90 an acre; 113 farms, six to
eight miles, $58.20; 149 farms
over eight miles from market
averaged $55.90 an acre.
While the matter of roads did
not directly enter into the in
vestigation, an analysis of the
findings shows them to be
strong argument for improved
highways. For, in essence,
good road is simply a shortening
of distance. A farm with good
road connections is really, for
practical purposes, that much
closer to market than one on
bad road, whether you ligure in
time used, power consumed or
wear and tear, to say nothing of
Model Marias Ranch
One of the finest of the many
fine stock ranches on the Mar
ias is that owned bv Robert
Russel, who was one of the
head engineers on the Valier
project, and Col. J. M. Stanford,
politican, development man and
capitalist. The ranch now con
tains 3,000 acres and most of it
is under irrigation. The ranch
is principally stocked by horses
and none has been sold since it
was purchased, so there is quite
a herd at present. Much of the
cut-over land has been plowed
up and sown to alfalfa, which
has proved a profitable crop, as
the horses, cattle and hogs thrive
upon it. The ranch is enclosed
entirely by a splendid four
wire fence, the buildings are
arranged with the idea of con
venience and are trim and neat
ly painted. In the modern hog
house over i00 tiny pigs are
being tenderly cared for. Cor
rals, horse barns, chicken house
and all other buildings are
models that any farmer might
profit by looking over. The
foreman of the big ranch, Otto
Severtson, takes great pride in
looking after the up-keep of
the place and is a man of many
original ideas. Dotted here and
there by heavy patches of good
timber bordering the banks of
the stately Marias and walled
in on both sides by rugged bluffs,
this ranch has scenic settings
that cast a spell upon the visi
tor. It was in an earlier day
the property of J. J. Miller,
Cut Bank's liveryman, and a
historic touch is given it by the
fact that one hundred and six
years ago Captain Lewis, famed
as a member of the Lewis &
Clark expedition, camped on
this ranch over night and had a
thrilling encounter with Indians,
who attempted to steal the hor
ses belonging to the Lewis &
Clark party.
Dodge Agency
The Northern Montana Lum
ber Co. has taken the local
agency for the Dodge auto and
expect a carload of these popu
lar cars in a short time. They
will be in a position to sell these
cars on easy payments. Those
who want a top-notch car at a
reasonable figure will soon have
the opportunity, as the Dodge is
the best on the market for the
money.

War in Cut Bank
Failure of Jim Hill Money
Causes Some Little
Commotion
Cut Bank, always metropoli

small industrial strike, all be
cause the blue pay checks doled
out by father Jim Hill have not
yet arrived. It is said that all
the other division town em
ployes along the line have had
their checks.
Five machinists recently sent
here to assist in the rush at this
terminal, yardmen, section and
coal house employes and round

It is said that an I. W. W. or
ganizer has been here recently
and in fact is here at present.
He worked on the "rip track"
awhile, but grew weary of com
mon labor and quit. Placards
and literature have been pro
miscuously posted about the
yards, eminating from I. W. W,
sources.
It seems to be a difficult task
to secure enough men at the
local terminal. Wages are high
all over the country and men
are scarce. The wages paid, the
men say, are too low.
Material is daily arriving for
the addition to the roundhouse
and surveyors are now at work
on the premises. It is expected
that work will begin about May
first.
William Jones, one of the pi
