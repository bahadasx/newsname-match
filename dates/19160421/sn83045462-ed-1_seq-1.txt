IAPAN FINDSPARTS
OF BILL REPUGNANT
)pposes Inclusion in U. S. Law
of Gentleman's Agreement
Affecting Immigration.
'RESIDENT TALKS'WITH
ENVOY AT WHITE HOUSE
Memoranda at State Department Refer
to Old Representations and
Raise New Points.
Viscount Chinda, the Japanese ambassador,
conferred with President Wil011
today over the provision of the
bending immigration bill which pro>osed
to enact into law the so-called
jentlernan's agreement restricting the
mmigration of Japanese laborers. Two
nemoranda on the subject have been
>resented to the State Department.
The proposed inclusion in a law. of
.n informal agreement which Japan
las promised oil honor to fulfill, acording
to the agreement between
ormer Secretary Root and former Ambassador
Takahira, is understood to
be repugnant to the '-ipanese governnent.
Object to Other Features.
Other proposed Asiatic exclusion feaures
in the bill as it has passed the
Touse and has been reported to the
Senate are understood to be subjects of
bbjection.
For many obvious reasons the attiude
of the administration is said to be
ne of disinclination to irritate the
situation between Japan and the
"nited states which has been smolderng
since the California anti-alien land
aw negotiations went into an indefinte
stage three years ago this spring.
Administration officials are not un
Congress, particularly among members
rom the Pacific coast states, and
heir constant endeavor has been to
illay it.
The United States never has replied
o Japan's last note on the California
and law.
Had Reached Deadlock.
The last that was said on the subec-t
was said by former Secretary
5ryan to Ambassador Chinda, when the
jegotiations got into the stage of ap>arent
deadlock, and the ambassador,
>n taking his departure from a conerence
at Secretary Bryan's office, in[Uired
if he were to transmit the last
cord of the United States to his government.
To that Secretary Bryan redied:
"There never can be a last word beween
friends."
One portion of the bill which is unerstood
to draw the resentment of the
apanese government is the inclusion,
y inference at least, of Japanese in
he excluded class with Hindus, alhough
the same paragraph of the bill
xcepts from the exclusion such as
re covered in "existing agreements."
'his phrase refers to the Koot-Takalira
agreement.
Statement at Cabinet Meeting:.
After today's cabinet meeting it beame
known that the two memoranda
lad been presented to the State Department.
The first referred to simiar
representations made a year ago
then the immigration bill was pendng
and the second brought up some
lew points.
The Question will be taken up by
'resident Wilson witn senate ana
louse leaders, an'd it is expected that
n agreement probably will be reached
vhich will avoid difficulty. The quesion
has already been discussed tentaively.
Administration leaders say they
xpect no real difficulty.
3FFICIALS HERE AWAIT
REPORTFRQfyi BERLIN
3ne of Their Chief Concerns Is as to
Possible Attack on Ships
While Case Is Pending.
Word from Ambassador Gerard, at
Berlin, that he had delivered the Amercan
note to the German government
md some indication from him as to
iow it was received were awaited with
teen expectancy by administration officials
today.
Unofficial advices early today saying
hat the ambassador had presented the
ommunication to the German foreign
)ffice last evening, and that the chancellor
had not yet seen it because of
lis absence at army headquarters,
vere read with interest by officials.
Pending Germany's reply to the
"nited States' demands that she immeliately
abandon the present methods of
onducting submarine warfare, one off
he chief concerns of officials here is
he possibility of another attack on a
ship carrying Americans. It was adnitled
thit an immediate rupture could
>nlv be prevented by proof that Gernany
had been unable to communicate
Aith her submarine commanders.
Delayed by Holiday.
How long the United States will wait
for the German reply has not been indicated.
It is suggested that the German
foreign office may be delayed in
replying immediately because of a
series of religious holidays in Germany.
which begin today and continue
jntil Tuesday.
Secretary Lansing, who conferred
with the President before the cabinet
meeting, said he did not expect any
iction until a reply was received from
jermany or unless another ship carrying
Americans were torpedoed by a
German submarine. He said that in
use diplomatic relations between the
two nations were broken the work of
the United States in caring for the diplomatic
interests of Germany in other
countries in all likelihood would be
suspended.

PAPERS, IF IDENTIFIED,
TO BECOME GERMANY'S
!
United States. However, to Retain,
Photographs of Those Seized in
von Igel Arrest.
The State and Justice departments
announced today the government's will- 1
ingness to return to the German em- ;
bassy all the papers seized in New York ]
with the arrest of Wolf von Igel which <
Count von Bernstorff will identify as offi- <
cial. Photographs of the seized docu- j
ments have been made and will be re- :
tairied. I
Count von Bernstorff protested vigorously
against the taking of the papers. I
and it was said at the State Department i
that Secretary Lansing was considering 1
the necessity of an official apology. ]
Should the ambassador assert that all
the documents are official, it is understood
that they will be returned to
him. but it was said to be the present
intention of officials to keep the pho- '
tographic copies. 1
i
Disclose New Details. . i
Officials were interested today in ,
learning if Count von Bernstorff would i
declare any documents to be the property [
of the German embassy.
The papers were said to disclose several s
subjects of an unusual nature which had
not oerore come i<> me duemiuu vi una ,
government. Definite connection with the
German embassy would be confirmed, it
was believed, by a declaration that the
documents are official.
If none of the documents is declared official.
It was understood, the United States 1
will use them all in the prosecution of von <
I gel. his associates and possibly others as ,
j yet unnamed.
Whether Secretary Lansing would send 1
a note to Ambassador Bernstorff expressing
regret for the seizure was not an- <
nounced. but such action is believed probable.
It
also was suggested- that the State
Department might delay action until the
submarine dispute with Germany assumed
a definite stage.
Embarrassment to the Embassy.
The embarrassing necessity would
seem to confront the German embassy
to determine what are official diplomatic
papers entitled to immunity from
seizure or inspection among those incriminating
documents seized in the
office maintained by von Igle in New |
York, in case?as is believed by gov- i
ernment officials in Washington?that I
office was rented by von Igle in his own I
name as a real estate office. It is not
a part of the functions of American
authorities under such conditions^ it
would seem, to discriminate between
any of the papers seized. The embassy
must pick and choose, and in doing so
will naturally reveal its interest in the
papers. ^
While the contents of the papers are
dications that the German embassy's
implication and pro-German activities
objectionable to the United States may
constitute a case as grave as that
which caused the recall of the Austrian
ambassador. Baron Dumba. It is
regarded as unfortunate that the matter
comes to a crisis at this time, when
the German situation is so acute as regards
submarine warfare.

Work Rushed at Charlestown Navy
Yard as Measure of Preparedness,
It Is Explained.
BOSTON, April 21.?Seven thousand
alue jackets at the Charlestown navy
yard were put in overalls today for the
purpose of making the thirty war vessels
in the harbor ready for sea at the
sarliest possible hour. It was authortatively
stated that virtually4 every
3hip would be at the top-notch of ef
Iciency in fifteen days.
The enlisted men are being employed
because of the difficulty in obtaining
sufficient civilian mechanics. Half of

and shore leaves.
Measure of Preparedness.
"It is a measure of preparedness." it
ivas officially explained, "the necessity

that we have been handicapped for
months by a shortage of civilian workmen
and material. If we are to make
these ships ready for sea at an early
notice repairs must be completed soon,
ind it was found that the only way to
accomplish this was to put the bluejackets
to work.
The vessels to be overhauled include
*ix battleships with a total of about
5,000 officers and men, ten torpedo boat
destroyers, three scout cruisers, one
submarine and several auxiliary ships.
No Special Orders at Norfolk.
NORFOLK, April 21.?At the Norfolk

There has been no necessity for putting

"Now the loan sharks have been driven

Officials of th? de facto government
>aid there was no basis for the reports
.hat uprisings were imminent in northern
Durango and lower Chihuahua. It
vas explained at Juarez that the movement
of the Carranza troops into the
r'arrai district was not liuenaen as a
threat to bar the further advance ??f
the American forces, but that the de
facto soldiers had been sent there t??
preserve border order and prevent destruction
of private property.
Thinks Purpose Is Accomplished.
Andreas Garcia, Mexican consul, said
today that the work of the American
expedition was concluded and that he
hoped that In a few days the order
would come from Washington for the
troops to be withdrawn. "We have
the situation in hand." said Mr. Garcia.
"The Villa cause is broken, and If
Villa still lives his prestige is destroyed."
Mr. Garcia said the government on
the 1st of next month will demand that
all import and export duties be paid in
gold. The Mexican consul did not
credit the reports that the law demanding
gold for such duties would create
trouble.
The continued absence of any confirmation
of the report of the death
of Francisco Villa has revived again
the popular industry In El Paso of locating
the bandit. During the last
two days he has been successively reported.
from "reliable Mexican sources."
as in Durango, Zacatecas and Ooahuila.
His last location was given today by
a Mexican railroad man as at San
Isidro. a Jittle town about thirty miles
soutn or farrai, in j_?urango.
Little Faith in Stories.
Little credence is placed in these
stories here by Americans and Mexicans
who are in the. best position to
secure reliable news from the interior.
There is a strong belief here that Villa
has never been as far south as Parral,
and that the real reason for the outbreak
against the American troops at
that town was that the Mexicans knew
Villa was in the north, and concluded
that the American soldiers were not
pursuing the bandit, hut were engaged
in a veritable invasion of Mexico.
With the troops marking time, awaiting
the decision from Washington
which will either withdraw them t'n?m
Mexico or send them forward, reinforced,
on their quest, there has been
a decided increase in the nervousness
which has existed on the border sine*
the expedition crossed the international
line.
No Change in Juarez.
Both Mexican and American army officers
and officials admit that the uncertainty
has caused a delicate situation.
but there has not been the slightest
indication in Juarez that the Mexicans
in that town have changed their
attitude of restraint.
Gen. Gavira renewed today his repeated
statements that the Carranza
leaders had no hostile intentions toward
the American columns, while thejr
felt that the time had come for the recall
of the expedition.
No news has been received in Juarez
regarding the party headed by Gen.
Cavazos and Col. Carlos Carranza,
which set out last Sunday to search
for the supposed grave of Villa. In reply
to a -query sent by Gen. Gavira,
Gen. Gutierrez, military commander in
Chihuahua, replied today that he had
heard nothing of the party place It
left Cusihuiriachic.

Data on Mexican Situation 'j
Is Laid Before the Cabinet
by President Wilson Today
All data at hand bearing on the Mexcan
situation received at the State and
CVar departments were submitted to the
-abinet today. President Wilson and
lis official advisers reviewed the Mexcan
problem fully for the first time
lince Gen. Carranza urged that the
American expeditionary forces be withIrawn.
It was regarded as unlikely, however, 4
hat any important action would be
aken by the cabinet pending receipt of
ull advices as to the military problems
he troops have encountered in Mexico.
This information probably will not be
Lvailable until the return of MaJ. Gen.

bserve the situation and report to Secetary
of War Baker. He is due at San
