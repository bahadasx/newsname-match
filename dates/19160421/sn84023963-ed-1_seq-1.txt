methods. "The trrowing of
these j
crops until within a few years could
not have been ranked as agriculture,
but should have been described aa
highway robbery of the soil. As a re-1
suit the average production per acre of
these crops has fallen to a minimum.
"Farming, for Ohe thing, must be
made more attractive. It should be
made more profitable. This will be
done as our farmers learn more thor
oughly the principles of intensive culti
vation and get a knowledge of the
methods of feeding the soil and of the
rotation of crops.
"To this end I have been preaching
for the past thirty years the. gospel of
the sugar beet.
4tThe production of the sugar beet
requires the highest styleof intensive
culture that science has been able to
suggest. The principles'of feeding the
sugar crops, the methods of culture
and handling, the attention and skill
of the workers, are, such asto create In
every field and factory devoted to
sugar culture an agricultural experi
ment station of the highest type. The
soil and climatic conditionsfin the great
er part of the United States are thor
oughly favorable to beet culture, and
America is the greatest sugar market
in the world.
'In the case of the sugar beet the
crops which are grown imrouraon v . ua
it yield very much larger-returns than
1 tJ 11V
when the old fashioned system of agri
culture prevailed. The raflex action ot
this influence "becomes a benefit to
American agriculture the value of
which it would be difficultto measure
In dollars and cents.
"Wherever the sugar beet is culti
vated the farmers are all prosperous, j
no matter what kind of other cropi !
they raise. The beet generally im-!
proves the productiveness, of the soil in1
all kinds of agriculture. It causes the
mnlrvimnt nf more lnihor and indl-1
recti' benefits commerce and transpor-
tation and produces in every commu-,
nity conditions of prosperity in agri
culture which it would be difficult to
bring about in any- other way.
4The culture of the beet brings Into
the neighborhood the large sugar fac
tory using fuel and other raw mate
rial, with its complement of laborers
and experts, thus giving a better and
more profitable market to the surround
ing farmers for all their products.

Stewart Edward White, doubtless
America's foremost woodsman and
author, who wrote the State Park
committeo: "I am very glad indeed
to add my word of commendation to
äs worthy an object as' establishing a
system of state parks. Our state and
federal parks in California have
proved to be of the greatest value and
to have been appreciated by a con
stantly increasing number of the pub
lic each year. The feeling on the

One- ! on: Vice-President Thomis R.
i Marshall, which said- "I am glad to
! observe that with far sightedness a
plan is being evolved whereby Indi
ana may celebrate her centennial by
opening up public parks, looking
eventually to a state park in each of
the ninety-two counties, all connected
by sood highways. Outdoor life is
more and more commending itself to
thoughtful citizens. Indiana was carved
out of a primeval forest. If the State
Park committee can induce the build
ing of these parks it will have helped
to restore to the sated palate of today
the flavor of the pioneer. I wish you
luck."
Senator John W. ICern wrote the
state committee: "I want to con
gratulate the Indiana Historcal com
mission upon its purpose to colebrare
the centennial of Hoos!er statehood
hy creating a permanent memorial in
scenic tracts for park purposes.
'I hope I may be ab:e to co-oporate
with you in some effective way in
"bringing success to your enterprise.'
A letter from Senator Thomas Tag
gart said: "I am in thorough accord
with the plan to celebrate the Hoosier
centennial by acquiring scenic tract
for park purposes. It is not only a
unique form of celebration, but its
adoption will be of vast civic value to
future generations of Hoosiers in lay
ing the foundation for a systematic
beautificstion of the state by the peo
ple. I sincerely trust that success may
crown your efforts."
From public officials and civic lead
ers throughout Indiana the state park
committee is also receiving hearty in
dorsement of its plans to bring out

GREAT RIVALRY BETWEEN RACING TEAMS
J a '
To show the intense rivalry between racing teams this year, there has
already been a change in the lineup of drivers for these three cars. Eddie
O'Donnell will captain the Duesenberg team. He is not exactly a veteran,
but the wiseacres predict that he has had just enough experience to put him
in shape for a big cleanup. D'Alene will be his team mate. "Pete" Hender
son was to guide the third steering wheel, but "Pete" has joined Ricken
bacher's Prest-O-Lite Racing Team. Who the third driver will be is a
question. A wonderfully speedy mount awaits someone with enough experi
ence and nerve to open it up.
These three cars will soon be seen on the Indianapolis Speedway in
practice for the 5C0-mile motor classic.
Judging from the pictures of D'Alene and O'Donnell they are happily
confident of success.

BANGOR (ME,) "DRY"
TWO WHOLE DAYS
Maine has been a prohibition
state for more than half a century.
The following 'commentary on con
ditions in "dry" (?) Maine is from
the Boston (Mass.) Post:
It was announced last week that
the Mayor of Bangor had ordered
the saloons of that city to close
down during the two days' session
of the Boys' Conference there, and
the police promised that the town
should be "dry" in observance of
the order and the event.
This was very commendable. It
was a good thing that the boys saw
no rumshops in operation while
they were in the fine and progres
sive city of Bangor. But why "dry"
for a couple of days? Is not Maine
under prohibitory law, with plenty
of penalty for its violation? Is the
law a farce, or isn't it? The two
days' "dry" order and obeyed, too
would seem to point that way.
Newspapers everywhere are still
talking about the Vermont election.
Liberal interests declare it is the be
ginning of the end for the national
prohibition movement. Anti-Saloon
League officials say it has little signifi
cance. Not the least of the editorials which
have made the liberals highly optim
istic is this, entitled "Has the Wave
Begun to Recede?" from the San Diego
(Cal.) Union:
Is the wave of prohibition beginning
to recede? It has been almost nation
wide in its force during the past two
or three years. It has won in state
after state, until now in nearly a score

put has the tide begun to turn?
That it has, will bo the conclusion that
some persons will draw from the re-!
suit of Tuesday's election in Vermont.
That state had, prohibition for half a
century; Dut returned about thirteen
years ago to local option, the latter j
then winning, however, by the voryi
slender majority of less than 800 votes, j
But in this election prohibition was
defeated by over 13,000, and that de
feat must be regarded as a crushing
one.
r .IntWsScountry, and prohably in
other lands, 'puuiic sentiment on most
great questions, social, moral and po
litical, comes and goes in waves.
Crime and disease to some extent may)
be said to do so also. So it is not!
unreasonable to suppose that the pro
hibition movement may in like manner
advance and recede.
Many persons will naturally wonder
whether the decline of that movement
may not have begun just at the time
when its supporters felt especially con
fident that it was destined to sweep
the country in the immediate future.

there may bo found some wild scenic
spot that the people of thor.e com
munities are already familiar with,
and to bring them into a chain ol
state parks would immediately spread
their fame over all Indiana. Good
roads now lead to these places, and
all that is necessary is to acquire the
beauty spots that they may be per
petually preserved for the use of the
public.
It is tho mission of the State Park
Committee to gather by public sub
scriptions as great a fund as possible
and to buy as many scenic and his
toric spots as it can. It is "up to"
the public to say through their sub
scriptions how great the, fund is to
be and how many beauty spots are tc
be purchased. The state, committee
thinks that it will be time enough to
select the spots that are to bo pur
chased after it- knows how much
money it will have for the purpose.
The tiino, therefore, for making
subscriptions is at hand and they can
be given to practically every news
paper office in Indiana, or they can
be sent to the State Eark Committee,
room 80, State House, Indianapolis.
N01ANA RICHES ARE
BEING UNCOVERED
State Park Plans to Preserve
Beauty Spots as Gsnten
nhT'feorial. "Know Indiana' io the watchword
this Hoosier Centennial year of
of
191G. And we are learning of It in
many ways. For practically the first
time we are uncovering one of its
choicest riches the beauty spots. We
are finding that it has untold riches
in the form ot scenic treasures which,
if they are to be preserved until we
can become better acquainted with
their charm and until we can pass
them on to the Hoosier generations
that are to come, these beauty spots
must be sought out and prompt and
definite action taken to perpetuate
them. How many of , these regions of
natural grandeur Indiana has no on
person knows, but there are two hun
dred or more. Most of them are in
the wild state as Nature created
them. They have alluring charm for
all who explore them and they only
await to be taken oveF from private
ownership, and converted into perma
nent public use as parks.
rne consensus or opinion among
Indiana people is that the Centennial
year snouiu oe marked in some
dignified and lasting way; that
the memorial should take a form in
which all the people may participate.; Emolderinjrecl top 0 my feet, with'
not only by contributing their means,: . r, 3i , , '
but to obtain some enduring civic consequences too dreadful to con

should be of such permanency that Quick as thought I put my left
the people of the next Hoosier cen-
tury will know that civic patriotism
was very much alive in Indiana in
the year 191 G.
State Parks fill all of these require
ments. With tho development of In
diana's other rich resources, like
agriculture, mining and transporta
tion, and all of them well advanced,
the second century of Hoosier State
hood can be marked by the develop
ment, through preservation, of still
another great resource of public
alue natural scenery, and those
: istorical spots that have been h&nd-
d down to us in the last one hun
dred years.

A NARROW ESCAPE

f a
Danaer.
One of the strangest incidents of
Hie sePv rebellion is told by Wil-
highland regiment, had the misfor
tune during a battle to lose tho
greatcoat which every soldier car
ried folded in what was known as
a "Crimean roll" and strapped to
passing through these rolls, it Hap
pened that m the heat of tot fight
my roll was cut right through where
the two ends were fastened togeth
er by the stroke of a keen edged
tulwar, which was intended to cut
me.
As the day was warm, I Wti rath
er glad to get rid of it, but by 10
o'clock at night there was a differ
ence in temperature, and when I
was relieved from patrol duty and
wanted to lie down to sleep I felt
the cold, wet grass anything but
comfortable, for a kilt is not tht
most suitable article of dress on a
cold IsTovember night in upper In
dia. My company was encamped in
and about the tomb of the iirst king
of Oudh. A large inclosure sur
rounded, Jhe building of tht tomb
itself, and on the- fhsido of tili
were small rooms built for tht ac
commodation of pUgrirns. When I
entered the inclosure I notiotdl
these apartments and asked permis
sion to sleep in one of them, but
was refused. I had to make the
best of my position, but wa3 too un
comfortable to sleep.
It struck mo that some of the se
poys might have dropped their
blankets in their hurried departuro.
With this hrpe I went into one of
the rooms where a lamp was burn
ing, took it off the Rh elf and walked:
to the door of i:.e great domed
mosque or tomb.
I peered into the orrk, but could
see nothing, so I a1! winced slowly,
holding the lamp over my head,
looking cautiously around until I
was in the center of the great vuult
where my progress was obstructed!
by a big black beau .-.bout four or
five feet high, which fvlt to my feet
like loose sand.
I lowered my lamp and discover
ed I was standing ankle deep in
loose gunpowder. About forty nun
dredweight of it lay under my nose,
and a hasty glance around showed
me twenty or thirty barrels of the
ame substance, o-.-r a hundred
tight-inch shells, A loaded and
with fuses fixed, and a profusion of
spare fuses 'and slow matches lyrn
about.
I took in my dagger at a glanct.
There I was, up to my kneea nearly.
In gunpowder, with a naked light
in my hand. My hair literally stood
on end, and my knee3 knocked to
gether. Cold perspiration brokr
out all over me. I had neither
cloth nor handkerchief in nrr pock
et with which to extingutah my;
light, and the next momont mihf
be my last, for the overhanging
wick alrAfldv thron tp.r,pA tn mrl th
hand under the down dropping
j flame and, clasping it firmly, ilowly;
turned to the door.
Pear so overcame all othef sen
lation that I felt no pain of the
burn until I was outside. Then it
was sharp .enough. I po'ired the oil
from the lamp into my burned
band. Then 1 knelt dona and
thanked God
Next I staggered to Captain Daw
ton und told nim. He did not be
liere ma and told me I hi waked!
up from a dream. I showed him th
powdtr still sticking on my wit
Xeet. He instantly roused the sleep
ing men and quenohad every spark;
at ia on the premise.
