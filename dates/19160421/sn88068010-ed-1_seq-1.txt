SCHOOL BOARD MEETING
Free Text Book Election Soon.
Teacher Matter Deferred.
Two Absent
The School Board held a
lengthy meeting Saturday night
and considerable time was spent
in discussion of the advisability,
not only of holding an election
to determine if the qualified vot
ers of this district desired free
text books for the grades but al
so of the effect on the city in
case the vote favored the adopt
ion of the free' text book system
in force in 15 states and ninety
per cent satisfactorily.
It was finally determined to
hold such an election, but the
date was not set in order to give
time for word from towns and
cities the size of Keytesville on
the question of the effect on such
cities or towns included in dis
tricts which had adopted the
plan.
Free text books may be had by
a vote at an annual election or a
special election, fifteen days no
tice having been given. If the
proposition carries, it empowers
the directors to supply free text
books to all the pupils in all the
grades, and the money to do so
comes from the incidental fund.
The directors must know that
the amount which will accrue to
the district from the foreign in
surance tax will be sufficient to
reimburse the incidental fund
for supplying not less than four
grades the first year. If the
amount from the foreign insur
a nee fund would not be large
enough to reimburse the inci
dental fund, then the directors
can supply no free books. The
amount which would, upon the
adoption of the law, go to the
district, has heretofore been
paid to the city of Keytesville
and of course upon the adoption,
the city would lose about $180.00.
The law prescribes that the
directors shall supply not less
than four of the grades the first
year with free books, and the
remaining grades in two years
more, and if, after getting start
ed, the money received from the
foreign insurance tax is. not
enough, the directors must make
up the difference from the inci
dental fund and any shortage
must be met by increased tax,
for all the pupils in all the grades
must be supplied with free
books in three years, if the plan
is adopted and gets under way
as suggested.
Failing to supply all the pupils
in all the - grades within three
years forfeits further right to
the insurance tax. The school
board went thru the question
very thoroly voted to submit the
question to the voters but held
the date for the reason referred
to above.
The question of employment of
teachers for the coming term
was introduced, but ' as two of
the members of the board were
absent, the matter was laid over,
The board passed a resolution
not to employ any teacher who
did not hold a first grade certifi
cate or its equivalent
Supt . Schools Carlstead and
Supt W. W. Gibbany who were
present - on invitation at - the
meeting of the1 board were ap
pointed a committee to present to
the board at its ; next meeting,
the probable cost of furnishing
free text books to the grades. It
is a safe guess to place the
amount which the board will
need to furnish free books to
four grades the first year will be
about $150.00.

City was here the first of the

relief operator.
Prest Ultimatum to Germany
Serious Break Threatened
Situation Tense.
Among other expressions used
by President Wilson in his final
note to Germany is the following:
"Unless the Imperial German
government should now immed
iately declare and effect an aban
donment of its present methods
of submarine warfare against
passenger and freight carrying
vessels, the government of the
United States can have no choice
but to sever diplomatic relations
with the German Empire alto
gether." Austria and Turkey werenot
included. The sicuation at Ver
dun in France, the deciding con
test, is about the same as a
week ago.

On A Long Trip
Minnis Adams, who left here
22 years ago, arrived Monday,
for a short visit to relatives and
old acquaintances from Orlanda,
Florida.
He and Mrs. Adams and their
four sons and four southern
friends in two Ford flivvers are
enroute from Florida to Miles
City Mont. They report having
some fine travel and some pretty
rough roads to get over on their
way so far, but had no trouble
until this side St Charles when
accidents delayed them for
short time.
Minnis is a cousin of Mrs. J.
L Hershey, Kimball and Will
Adams and Mrs. Sudie Garnett
and Mrs. John Kuhler, all of
whom he stopped over to visit
for a short time after so long
absence.
He looks very little like he did
when he left this county but
retains sufficient of his boyhood
appearance to be easily recog
nized by many old friends.
The tourists will resume their
journey this week and go via
Marceline and St Joe.
km. J? rea u. uardner, says
that when he is governor there
will be more business and less

the race as it now stands.

the assertion that such an order
will be made at the date set for
next meeting. The order would
have to be made at a regular
term of court in May.
There was much debate and
some rather strong language
used and decidly personal direct
reference to the court and its
actions.
Legal opinion is solid on the
court having to make due provis
ion for the maintainance of such
ditch as the Chariton river ditch
and others constructed under the
law, and tho the personal atti
tude of the judges is against
such a levy, there is no other
course for the court to follow,
than that laid down by statute
for its guidance.

All High School Athletics
Oratorical and Literary
Excercises Fine
The day before the great meet '
of youth, beauty, athletes, scho
lars and orators at Brunswick
was a bad one for almost any
thing except duck- hunting, and
of course Friday the roads as
well as the track were in bad
condition. Had the rain not
spoiled the public highways
there would have been an over
flow crowd in the city on the
ground to vitnes3 the athletic
exercises tor the winners for
which medals had been procured,
and the big opera house would
have not come as near holding
the people who would have been
present as it did, and at that it
lacked seating capacity by 500
for the literary exercises and
music on the program for the
evening.
Profs. Clawson and Gibbany
and LiveSay had worked very
hard and long to make the event
of the kind the greatest ever
held in this county, and that
they succeeded admirably, no
one will question who had the
pleasure of being present day
or night.
The attendance of high school
pupils was enormous, this school
sending not less than 50, and it
appeared that every pupil in the
Triplett high school turned out
for the day.
It was disagreeable on the
athletic grounds, the wind being
raw enough to penetrate and
make one uncomfortable unless
in action most of the time. The
track which had been prepared
on the ball grounds near the
station, was not the best by any
means, and altogether conditions
generally were unfavorable for
the runners, jumpers and other
contestants to show just what
they could do. The high jump
was hotly contested as also was
the hurdles; in fact, there was
not an event which was not of
great interest to spectators, and
tho Keytesville fell down in
each of the hurdles, our boys
gave a good account or them
selves; such good account that
we brot away the highest score,
Charley Bondurant having se
cured 23.
Numbers of the entries 6howed
too plainly that their training
had not been at all thoro, for if
there ever assembled a number
of young men and girls who
looked like athletes, they were
on tne grounds at Brunswick
last Friday.
The exercises at the opera
house Friday night were not up
to the standard nor did they
con pare favorably with those
on the grounds in the afternoon
from the point of training, yet
that many of those competing
were splendid material out of
which to form notables, the
approval of the audience assures.
