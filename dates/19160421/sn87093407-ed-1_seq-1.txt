WARmaycome. Yet we must hope it will
be averted. It it does come, Americans
will be quick to respond withflie fireof patriot
ic enthusiasm. Yet it is no part ot patriotism
to yearn for war OR TO CAMPAIGN FOR IT.
In these days of tense, critical situations, let us keep our poise. We are not to
day at war. In the hearts of true Americans, there it the hope that we will continue
at peace with honor. If there is a possibility of avoiding war's horrors, the human
ity of Woodrow Wilson is great enough to avoid it. Let us not deny him that
chance. President Wilson needs the moral support of the country now as he has
needed it at no other time.
It needs but a spark to set the flames of ufar to this nation. Ie it the part of
humanity or patriotism to supply that spark by unruly passion, immoderate speech,
inflammatory urging?
If war does come, patriotic Americans wfll not shirk it, nor took to shirk its
responsibilities, burdens and sacrifices.
Yet, proud as Americana must ever be to gird on the aword of battle for HU
MANITY, tense as the situation now appears, it is the part of patriotism to retain
a calm, unimpassioned state of mind and heart.
God grant (hat if the United States must go to war,
it shall not be driven to it by the clamor ot the lingo
papers nor the counsel ot the professional militarist.

BERLIN, April 21.—(8y Wireless to Tuckeryon, N. J.)
—Germany can go no further in her submarine concessions
to America, Admiral Von I loltzendorff, chief of the admir
alty staff, declared today in an interview with the United
Press.
But the naval head said later, in the course of the inter
view :
* "We have no desire for a break with the United States.
That would be insanity. We shall not bring it about,
despite our desire to push vigorously our submarine warfare.
"We have definitely agreed to want the crews and
passengers of passenger liners. We have lived up to that
promise in every way, but we cannot !>e to regard
freight ships in the >>ame manner.
"I speak in a straightforward manner
"We could have destroyed hundreds of thousands of tons
of enemy ships since the beginning of the submarine war
except for promises we gave the United States, but we
cannot go further.
RING AROUND BRITAIN WILL GROW TIGHTER
"Five months more will sec what we can do to Britisl I ■;
shipping The ring around the Briti-h isles will grov I
tighter and tighter. Then we will see whether England wi* I
still maintain that she cannot make peace until Germany >|| |
destroyed.
"What I said about freight ships applies only to enemy
freighters. We are not going to torpedo, and have not tor
pedoed without warning, or without examining the ship s
! papers, any neutral ship, despite reports the enemy is spread
"We are not out to torpedo without warning neutraSSSß
ships bound to England. Our have respectel|jß
i every one of them so far, and there have heen scores in thdjr^l
North sea. the Fnglish channel and \he Atlantic. " '
"If diplomatic relations with America are broken, our
submarines can attack anv enemv ship without warning, n V,
SAYS GERMANY MUST USE HER U-BOATS $ 1
"I don't think the American people want to declare war
against Germany for the way «he is conducting her
marine war now. I don't think America wants to protect
England. r
"I don't think the American people want to do every- * Q
thing they can to help England win. even by protecting
English freight ships with American lives.
"C.ermany must attack England's life nerve, which is her A
shipping
"We have the means thru our submarines to do this, and
we must gn ahead
"England is responsible for American lives on her freight
ship* We cannot warn Americans on board any more than
we can send word to neutrals who may be in enemy trenches
before we attack.
"It is the same situation on the seas exactly. And still
we know that all passenger ships now going to England
carrv war munitions, not necessarily ammunition or shells,
hut articles which are much more necessary to help Eng
land continue war."
The admiral was filled with energy and spirit.
When he talks he is the most serious official in Germany.
His whole body vibrates energy. Every word carries con
viction because he speaks so frankly and unhesitatingly.
One feels he is speaking out instead of jotting down
thoughts hcTr>rehand to make an impression.
During the entire interview he erect in a leather chair,
his eves directly on the interviewer, his remarks coming sud
denly with a punch, like shots from a cannon.
Bernstorff May Get His

WASHINGTON, April 21.—
Ambassador Von ®ernetorff

which hs cannot eecapa, If ths
Interpretation placed here to

< It was freely predicted that
Von Bernetorff might be hand

The situation was brought
ahout by the arreet of Wolf

Washington has concluded that

against It.
Whether Von llernstorff run show
that Washington Is wrong remains
to be seen.

BY CARL W. ACKERMAN
eight demands were made for the
return of Von Igel's papers and for
the photographic copies of them
taken by the I'nlted Htates district
attorney's office.
The trap results from Von Bern
storff's desire to reclaim the docu
ments as embassy papera and yet
not admit officially that they are
the property of himself or the em
bassy.
If the embassy refuses papers In
volving criminal propaganda, the
government Is free to use them
The documents and the evidence
of Von I>er Golt* are believed to
show that ('apt Von l'apen and
Hoy-Kd. recalled embassy attaches,
were not the "highest up" in the
alleged propaganda plots
Much interest is apparent in the
capital today concerning the al
leged confession of Horst Von Per

to have revealed in l.ondon plana
for astounding activities in Amer
ica involving Von llernstorff and

with names and dates, tells how he
secretly met Von Papen, thru Vice
