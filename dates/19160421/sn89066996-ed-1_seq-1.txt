AT THE BREAKING
POINT WITH GERMANY
President Forwards Drastic Note on
Submarine Warfare Lays Whole
Matter Before Congress
The situation between the United
States and Germany over the latter's
persistence in carrying on its sub
marine warfare in violation of all the
rules of international law, looks as if
the breaking point had been reached.
The President has forwarded a note
to the German Government which is
regarded as virtually an ultimatum,
closing with these significant words:
"If it is still the purpose of
the Imperial Government to pros
ecute relentless and indiscrimi
nate warfare against vessels of
commerce by use of submarine
without regard to what the Gov
ernment of the United States
must consider the sacred and in
disputable rules of international
law and the universally recog
nized dictates of humanity, the
Government of the United States
is at last forced to the' conclu
sion that there is but one course
it can pursue. Unless the Imper
ial Government should now im
mediately declare and effect an
abandonment of its present meth
ods of submarine warfare against
passenger and freight carrying
vessels, the Government of the
United States can have no choice
but to sever diplomatic reunion
with the Empire of Germany al
together. This action the Govern- j
ment of the United States con
templates with the greatest re
luctance, but feels constrained to
take in behalf of humanity and
the rights of neutral nations.
So grave does the President regard
the situation that he requested a
joint meeting of the two branches of
Congress on Wednesday, and deliver
ed in person an address to that body,
giving a clear and carefully prepared
resume of the whole submarine con
troversy and Germany's persistence
in carrying on its submarine warfare
of sinking non-combatant passenger
vessels, without warning, of the neu
tral nations as well as of the belliger
ent. He did not ask Congress to take
any action simply laid the facts be
fore it. The spirit in which Germany
receives the President's note is
awaited with anxiety.
The tense situation had the effect
of hurrying up the Senate's action on
the army reorganization bill and it
was rushed tlirougn mat uouy im
mediately after the Presidents rc-

States at an estimated strength of
280,000 men, and covering other
features looking toward preparedness
for war.
Bernstorff Urges Berlin to Submit to
U. S. Demands
Washington, April 19 Count von
Bernstorff, the German Ambassador,
sent to Berlin tonight a long dispatch
interpreting the situation in Washing
ton and making certain recommeda
tions. He is understood to have ad
vised his Government that ne De
lieved the United States meant what
it said in its submarine note and that
something would have to be done
quickly if the friendly relations were
to continue.
The ambassador himself, having
read the address of the President and
the note, said:
"T ii make no comment either up
on the address or upon the communi
cation which has been sent to my
Government."
However,, he was authoritatively
described as having advised the Ber
lin Foreign Office in the message sent
tonight that ha believed at least some
such declaration as that made re
garding the conduct of submarine
warfare in the Mediterranean Sea
! should be issued immediately to cov
I or all submarine operations.
The Mediterranean declaration was
handed to Secretary Lansing by the
7 of this
year. It contained assurances much
broader in their scope tnan tnose giv
the activities of subma
rines in the war zone around the Brit
ish Isles, where Germany has con
tended from the ttrst tnat sne was
engaged in a campaign of retaliation
for the British blockade.
The assurances were to the effect
that only a cruiser warfare would be
conducted against enemy merchant
shipping and that non-combatant
ships of every character, freight as
well as passenger carrying, wouiu ue
accorded proper warning and safety
fur their passengers and crews. The
assurances which have been given for
the war zone around the British Isles
covered only "liners.."

EQUALIZATION BOARD
RAISES ASSESSMENTS
Over $800,000 Added to Lead Compa
nies' AssessmentsThe Times'
Position is Indorsed
The County Board of Equalization
finished up its work last week, and is
deserving of some commendation for
the increase it made in the assessment
of the lead companies, approximately
$880,000, other increases aggregating
$144,460, or a total increase of $1,-
024,460. The county's assessment for
the current year therefore will total
nearly $14,000,000, as follows:
Real estate $ 8,713,707

county revenue fund, and $3,500 to the
county road fund, which will help
some. The Board might have added
another million to the assessment of
the lead companies without exceeding
the per cent at which most of the real
estate of the county is assessed, but
the action taken by the Board of
Equalization is in the right direction
and to be commended1.
As the only paper in the county that
has advocated and urged such an in
crease in the assessment, The Times
feels that its position has not only
been endorsed but justified by the ac
tion of the Board of Equalization.
The Board is composed of the three
Judges of the County Court, Garrett,
Watts and Hale, and Assessor Wells
and County Surveyor Holman, with
County Clerk Wulfert as ex-officio

Why Not Have a
Dramatic Club?
John Wilkson, an old and widely
known citizen of Bonne Terre, was
arrested Saturday by Jim Richardson,
Deputy Constable of Flat River, on
two informations charging him with
illegal sale of intoxicants under the
local option law. Luther Bearden, of
Flat River, is the prosecuting wit
ness. The preliminary hearing was
before Justice ot tne reace m. y.
Mason, and bail was fixed at $100 m
each count, which the defendant gave.
The Times understands that this
case was worked up by Luther Bear
den and Bert Lawson, of Lcndwood,
going over to Bonne Torre, where
Bearden had no difficulty in buying the
"booze" from Wilkson, which resulted
in the lotter's nri'RRf..
It is common report that Bonne
Terre is still practically wiui; upeu ,
there being a number of "joints

"red-eye" they may desire is the price.
We understand, however, that the
good people of that place do not pro
pose to submit to such flagrant law
violations, and tnat strenuous en oris
...ill ho mods tn enforce the law there
to the letter. The local option law
was voted on tnis county Dy a large

Higbee of Montana

The three-act comedy drama, "Hig

at the Monarch, under the auspices of
the local lodge of Rebekahs, was an
excellently rendered production, quite
in keeping with the well earned repu
tation Farmington home talent has
for scoring a success invariably in
dramatic productions.

would hold without bulging out at the

Death of Mrs.
Wm. H. Agnew
Mrs. Cora Eliiabeth Agnew, wife
of Wnt H. Agnew, died April 15,
1916, at the home of her mother, Mrs.
Mary F. Doss, near Farmington, aged
41 years, 3 months and 27 days. She
was born in Ste. Genevieve county
December 18, 1874, and was married
to Wm. H. Agnew October 22, 1896.
Four children were born to this un

Mrs. Agnew joined the Southern
Methodist Church at Salem when she
was only nine years old, and her
whole life has been one of devoted
faith and Christian service. Knowing
that her end was near she called the
family to her bedside, left loving
messages for each, and her gentle
spirit nnarfaid and full of faith then
passed out into the mysterious rami
that lies beyond, to be with her father,
who went that way less than three
years ago, and to enter into the joy
and rest of those who die in the Lord.

The proceeds of the entertainment
will be used for the worthy purposes
of the Rebekahs, and it is possible the
players will yield to the general de

that the play be taken to Frederick

somewhat better facilities and a
larger house, it can be presented to
better advantage.
