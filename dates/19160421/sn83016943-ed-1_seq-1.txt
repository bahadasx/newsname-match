Notice to Teachers
The law has been changed somewhat
with regard to the requirements for
teachers' license. Teachers are re
quested to read the following carefully
in order that they may not be any con
fusion as to the standing of each.
Applicants are not allowed under the
new law to transfer license to home
county, except when attending school
or authorized bv state board of exam
iners.
Professional license is granted with
out examination to graduates of all
state colleges and other standard four
year colleges, provided the graduate
has creJit in the institution for not less
lhan nine hours in education.
The State Board of Education will
grant license to teach without examin
ation to holders of license from other
states under proper regulations.
Teachers holding first or second
grade county or state license may have
same renewed without examination,
on the completion of a six weeks'
conrse in college or in summer normal.
The course will be prescribed by the
state board of examiners in the nor
mals this summer for the benefit of
teachers who wish to take the course
in lieu of the spring examination.
There will be no county normal in
this county this year; but I have ar
ranged with the A. & M. College to
consolidate our institute with theirs.
This begins June the Cth, and continues
for six weeks. Dr. Roberts, the
director of the normaj informs me that
owing to the legislature's not making
any appropriation lor tne normal it
will be absolutely necessary to make a
charge on all who attend. I regret
this since I had understood that Noxu
bee teachers would not be charged any
fee. and had so announced. Yet, I
think that notwithstanding this small
charge, cur teachers can pet a great
deal more benefit from the six weeks
work than they couid from ten days in
a county institute.
Now, I would like to insist on the
importance of teachers attending
some institute during the summer; it
seems .to me the only way in which w e
can keep up to date. Your . efiiciency

Section 24. That any person

law shall be punished by a line of

months, iu the discretion of the
court.

parts of laws, general, special or
local, in conflict with the provi
sions of this act as to the game
and lish laws, are repealed.

effect and be in force from and
after its passage.

The fact
Cabot Lodge
that Senator Henry
is leading the oppo
sition to the continuation of
Brandeis to the' Supreme Court is
given particular interest by the
report that Mr. Brandeis, follow
ing his confirmation, will decline
the honor. And that he will
offer for the Senate against Lodge,
that he may prove that the vot
ers of Massachusetts do not hold
him in such little esteem as the
"high brow" element, led by
Senator Lodge, would have it ap
pear. Such a turn to a long pend
ing contest would be in the nature
of a political cataclysm. It would
constitute the paramount side in
terest in the election of the Presi
dential year. Vicksburg Herald.
The renewal of the bloodv drive
on Verdun gives an apparent con
firmation to the alleged saying of
the Kaiser: "That the war would
be fought out at that point."
While on a vastly larger scale,
the Verdun tug of war recalls
Giant's famous declaration: "We
will fight it out on this line if it
takes all summer." It in fact
took all spring, summer, winter
and the half the following spring.
Nor is there any Sherman to
march to the Kaiser's relief. In

Peanut Growing in Noxubee.
Peanut growing was quite extensive
ly engaged in. in Noxubee County last
year, something over 5000 acres having
been grown. The yield was very satis
factory, from 25 to 40 bushels per acre
i.eing harvested according to the quali
ty of the land used. The prices real
ized and the fact that there was no
certain market at all times were con
siderable drawbacks. However, the
vines made fine hay of good nutritive
value for all kinds of stock, and the
nuts splendid feed for hogs, and mules
too, so that the farmers who did not
sell their crops were well satisfied.
Many farmers here this year will grow
considerable acreage for home con
sumption. Lart year's prices, carload
lots, ranged from 60 to 90 cents a
bushel, This county shipped about 20
carloads.
The local peanut growers association
has been very active, and the disad
vantages of last year, it is believed,
have been removed. The Imperial Cot
ton O.l Comp uiy here has announced
definitely that it will very probably put
in a crusher at its local plant, but
whether it does so or not that it will
certainly be in the market as a pur
chaser of peanuts every day during
the season. This insures a ct-rtain
market, and the value of the crop as
feed on the farms will go far to insure
fair values. This eeasnn's acreage id
estimated at 7.500. The local growers
association has afcout 50 members and
is a strong body. It is prepared to
furnish seed nuts, information as to
the various kinds, soil adaptability, fer
tilization, etc., as well as to aid in
marketing the crop. R. E. V. Yatea, of
Macon, is secretary.
Sir. V. C. Cavett had as his guest
several days the past week his nephew,
Cavett Binion, and his little son,
Deale. of Oklahoma City. Mr. Binion
is serving his second term as sheriff of
the county, and was en route to Pop
larville, Miss., with a requisition for a
prisoner. Mr. Binion is a native of
Noxubee county and when a boy left
there to make his home in the west.
He has succeeded in business ar.d his
popularity is attested by the fact that
he has been twice elected sheriff in
Oklahoma City, a town of 75,000 popu
lation. While in Mississippi he visiud
his old home at Macon and a most cor
dial welcome was given him by his
MississiDpi relatives and friends.

No Licenee Required to Fish
State flame and Fish Commis
sioner Z. A. Ilrantley says that
the new game and lish law re
ipiired no license to lish.
"Nothing could be further from
the . truth,'' said Commissioner
lirautley, and continued, "the
new law did not in any way,
shape or imuiinr c'i.ii.u'' the for
mer laws, and mii ( f them re
ipiiml anyone t pt a license to
lish. The former law forbid sein
ing.and dynaifiiiii.;- of fish in the
lakes and streams of Mississippi,
and the law creating the lish and
;a:iie depurtment places a privi
lege tax on Iium'.c sonly, and puts
into clT-ct t S r 1 1 cessary machin
ery to enforce all the game and
lish laws, iiew and old.
"I want every i nc to distinctly
undeistand thar there is no
license required of those who wish
to lish, but also to impress upon
everyone the further fact that
fish, under the old law, which is
not repealed, inut be token only
with hook and line.
"I lindthat the new game law
has met with popular favor, and
the ouly criticisms beard have
come about because of the misap
prehension that a license bad to
be secured before one would be
permitted to fish. .This, n& I said
before, is not true."
