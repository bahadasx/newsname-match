I.AI'NCHINt! F TI1H SHU' CITY OF PORTLAND
dustry." Ho congratulated Mr. Mc
Cormlck and his company on their
foresight and enterprise in getting
into that business.
Portland will bo the home port of
the City of Portland, although all
tho other McCormlck ships make Sun
Francisco their homo port.
Wlillo thu launching of tho City of
Portland marks an epoch in deep sea
craft which will touch at many for
eign ports, advertising tho great Co
lumbia und Portland, the local In
terest will center In tho launching of
tho City of St. Helens, tho keel of
which has already been laid. Tele
gram llazen has woll said:
"When tho good ship City of St.
Helens makes her first llttlo dtp the
townsfolk aro going to put on their
best bid and tucker and aro going to
unlock every door and gate In the
town and throw iiwuy the keys.
Everybody In Oregon Is going to be
Invited to tho feasting and dancing.
The calendars aro to bo dated from
Hint day forth, for St. Helens has
become a brido of tho sea."
Tlm City of Portland is 200 feet
over all, 44-foot beam, and 22 feet
moulded depth. Two million feet of
lumber was used in tho construction
of tho vessel.
Fore and aft truss construction
rolnforces tho hull without Interfer
ing with tho handling and storage of
lumber, and In order to facilitate
the handling of long length timbers,
bow and stern ports will be provided.
The cargo will bo handled with four
regulation steam winches with 130
poiind marine hollers.
She Is to bo equipped wllh five
masts and carry tho usual amount of
canvas for a schooner of her size.
Tho auxiliary power plant of this
vessel will consist of two 4-cylinder
llollnder engines of the soml-Diesel
MARINE HISTORY
type, each unit helng 320 II. I'. and
225 It. 1'. M., swinging a 4-foot
lilado (JxX propeller. The need by
motor propulHion ulono will bo about
H h not h.
Tlm advanlago of auxiliary power
in a lumber Hchoouer are many and
well JuBtll'y the coHt of engine Instal
lation. The Having In towage and
Iho time saving in the calm belts,
and the greater npeod at which the
vessel travels are all dominant fact
ors in increasing the shtp'B earnings
and utility. The Having In crew coHtH
can he Keen when only three men are
required in the engine room.
I'Vom mi Investment point of view,
Hie points advanced in favor of the
wooden hlp may be briefly stated as
follows: That four carriers of 2,
000,000 feet capacity can be built for
the coHt of ono 5,000,000 feet steel
steamer; that a cargo of 2,000,000
feet is not too largo to be readily ab
sorbed at either foreign or domestic
ports; that the loss of a ship of this
size and capacity would not neces-
V
y-x m. ' -
sit,
. -
sarlly cripple a firm's trade and fin
ally that the auxiliary power feature
presents marked economies in oper
ating costs over either a steam or
sailing schooner.
Tliis vessel will carry fuel oil suf
llclent fur a run of sixty days and the
radius of action Is practically unlim
ited. Many launches and tho steamer
Meltako were utilized lu taking the
crowds from tho dock to the ship
yards, which are located on Suuvios'
Island, free transportation for all.
Two bands, one from tho Uenson'
"Tech.". and one from tho Washing
ton High, accompanied tho Portland
party on the steamer I'ndine. Dur
ing tho wait preceding tho launching
tho students stnged a grand march
led by tho bands, on the deck of the
now ship.
Tim St. Helens band also contrib
uted to the pleasures of tho day.
Miss Elizabeth Wiggins, who
christened the vessel, was presented
by tho McCormlck company with a
handsome gold wrist, watch bounti
fully engraved, as a token of their
esteem and appreciation of her dis
tinguished services.
Sho was given A-l classification in
the Hureau Veritas by K. II. I.averie,
chief surveyor of that organization,
New York, who was here this week
mid Inspected the vessel. This will
entitle tho owners to obtain insur
ance on the vessel at thu usual rate
quoted anywhere In tho world.
Tho City of Portland has been
chartered to mako four trips to Aus
tralia with lumber cargoes. Her
earnings will be adequate to pay the
original cost of her construction be
fore all of those passages have beeii
completed. Returning from the
Antipodes, sho will carry cargoes of
conl. Sho can handle 2200 tons of
that product In her hold at a trip.

THE WHITE SOX LOSE
Kirkputrii ks Stage Kally Wliich Wins
the Game
It was a hard game to lose, for it
looked as though we had It safely
tucked away uud would still be the
l.eaguo leaders, but the ninth inning
dashed these hopes. Still it was In
tel et lug from start to finish and the
game wasn't over until the last St.
Helens man was out. It was the kind
of game the funs like, and the 250
present came out of the grounds feel
ing that they bad received their
money's worth. The Kirkpatricks
started tilings right In the first frame
scoring ono run; St. Helens came
back with two and 1t went that way
until the third when with the uld of
hits, errors and overthrows, St. Hel
ens scored four runs, giving them a
comfortable lead. Manager Heales
has instilled in his team a little fight
ing spirit and they showed It in the
fourth period, when they scored two
runs and added another in the fifth.
This made the score 4 to 6 and it re
mained that until the ninth, when a
couple of errors by the home guard
and a woll placed two base bit by
linker with two men on the paths,
brought in just tho required number
to tie tho score. Another single and
the score was 7 to 0 against us. St.
Helens made a valiant effort in their
half of the ninth to overcome this,
and had two men on bases, but Hall's
drive went a little high and fell into
I lie hands of t'enterfielder J. Dixon,
thereby blasting the hopes of the
rabid fans along the coaching line.
Hayes, who followed, was an easy
out and tho game was over.

A l ew Itcmui-ks l-om the Kjxirting
Kditor, as lie Sees It
Six of the White Sox hit the ball,
Stevens leading with three hits out
of four times up, two cracking good
singles and a triple. Pretty good
for one game, Virg.
Dill made several good stops and
also a running catch which came
near being in the impossible class.
The one hand stop Steve made
brought the fans to their feet.
Hayes was so anxious to get to
third that he forgot Heese was rest
ing there; resulting in the running
down of the little middle garden man
between home and third.
Mickey showed speed when he
beat out his bunt. He handled six
chances and the one error he made
was a hard luck one.
Umpire Grayson sent First Base
man Dixon to the bench for protest
ing a little too vigorously. The de
cision Grayson made in calling Dixon
out at second was a bad one, never
theless, he did right in sending Dix
on to the bench and showing his au
thority. The fans do not like to see
an umpire of no backbone nor one
who will argue with a player for an
hour. Grayson wus decidedly off on
his decisions and he couldn't seem to
locate the plate. However, we think
he was entirely honest in all of his
decisions.
Manager Heales liked St. Helens;
he also liked the last week's Issue of
tho Mist, for be handed In the coin
for a year's subscription. He has
charge of the incinerator for the city
of Portland.
There were twelve real autos park
ed on the ground. Counting Bob
Cole's red "Go Devil," .there were
thirteen. Maybe this was the cause
of the unlucky ninth.
Pete Brukke has signed with
Woodland. He will play third base.
In Sunday's game, as the box score
shows, he made one hit out of four
times up. He also made four assists
with one error charged to him. Pete
tells us this was a very hard chance,
and not being there to judge, we will
have to take his word for It.
The "pep" shown by Ballagh's
White Sox leads one to believe that
all of them were not out all Saturday
night. A little sleep helps a ball
player. Baseball fans will be interested to
learn that Stanley Coveleskie, one of
Portland's pitchers of 1915, and
bought by Detroit In the American
League, pitched against Detroit on
Sunday last. He fanned the dreaded
Ty Cobb and pitched great ball, until
the twelfth inning, when he blew up
and allowed Detroit to bunch five
hits, Detroit winning the game. Stan
ley's brother, who pitches for Detroit,
was scheduled to appear against his
"kid" brother, but refused to do so,
which goes to show that the old say
ing that "blood is thicker than wa
ter," applies to baseball as well as
war.
The St. Helens Juniors journeyed
to Deer Island Sunday and were de
feated by that team by a score of 6
to 4. There is good material In the
Juniors and a little aid from the ex
perienced players will help them
wonderfully. Look them over, Ed,
for next year you might need several
of them.
Donaldson showed his head work
when he stopped a belated throw
from center field and instead of re
laying It to home plate, where there
was only a slight chance of catching
the runner, threw to second, catch
ing his man by several feet.
When Alex Donaldson, superin
tendent of streets of Portland, was
down In his machine to see how his
son performed on the pitching lino,
he didn't like the ninth Inning very
much. Alex deserved to win.
Earl Perry has always been con
sidered one of the mainstays of the
team. He is a good fielder and a
fairly good batter; however It doesn't
show the proper spunk to quit the
game when he thinks the umpire
called him out on a bad one. His
quitting might have been tho turn
ing point in the game. Stay with It,
Earl, and keep the fighting spirit up,
which is at least 50 per cent to any
ball player.
