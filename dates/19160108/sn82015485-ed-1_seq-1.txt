S How Did Your Invoice Show Up?
This is the season of the year when it is usual to take
stock of the mercantile business in order to prove the pro
fits of the year's work.
- Other lines-of business make their annual statements at
this time and and we believe that it is a' good time for every
one to look over the year past and see if it has been a pro
fitable one. .
J.
This is a good time to correct some

The use of a check book will be a great help in the pro
fits of the year to come; if you are not using a check book
now i$ the time to commence.

The precipitation at Wa-Keeney
during the year 1915 was 31.75 inches,
including melted snow, etc. It is. a
record breaker and about. fifty per
cent more than the average annual
precipitation. The rainy season be
gan earlier and continued later, and
rain fell oftener, than usual but there
were no two inch rains during the
whole season. The rainfall in 1909
was 31.01 inches.

Fifty-nine marriage licenses were
issued in Trego- county during1 the
year 1915. . This is about fifty- more
than the average. Only 103 were is

1915. -

If it be true that one extreme fol
lows another we may expect 1916 to
be a dry year, both climatically .and
matrimonially.- And let us hope that
it may be a great deal drier in other
ways. Bottleways for instance.
But there is one place in Kansas
where they appear to have one or
more matrimonial, showers every day
in the year, on an average. At
Olathe, in Johnson county, the Pro
bate Judge issued 426 marriage lic
enses during the last year.- However
224 of these were issued to couples
who came over from Kansas City.
Mo., only twenty miles away. And
you can't blame a Missouri couple for
wanting a Kansas ceremony. " It
means good luck, and they know
where to go to e "put out of their
misery" with neatness and despatch.
Only a few days ago a K. C, Mo.j
couple came all the way to Wa-Keeney
to make sure of a good start in
life.
o
O yes, that coup'e got their "start"
all ' right and although we do not
know where they are going, or wheth
er the? shall wander, our most bliss
ful blessing will follow them all the
days of their years. - Every license
issued adds twenty shillings to the
county funds and we want our pat
rons to feel that it is money well
spent. - - .

MARKET REPORT
Kansas City Stock Yards, Jan.4, 1916.
Beef cattle are starting January in
a promising way, sales steady yester
day, and steady today, with the late
market active and stronger. Nothing
very toppy in beef steers has been here,
a few up to (8.25, yesterday, and some
today at $8.O0, bulk of the steers 7 to
$7.75, a few plain cattle at $6.50 to
$6.75. Good cows sell around $6.00,
and choice ones . would reach $6.75,
good " heavy bulls up . to $6.00, fancy
baby heifers $7.50 to $9, one lot of good
650 lb. heifers today at $7.50, medium
class heavier heifers. 5. 75 to $6.50,
veal calves $8 to $9 50. Stockers and
feeders are selling strong, choice
stock cattle bringing high prices. A
string of panhandle yearlings brought
$8 yesterday, and some fancy white
face yearlings were sorted out of a
drove at $8.40. . However, $6 to $7 buys
most of the fair to good stockers, and
plain feeders bring $6.25 to $6.75, a
few fleshy feeders above $7 and one
or two lots recently up to $8. Cattle
on feed at the. Western Sugar mills
are just starting to market, but will
not run freely for a month yet, and
western hay fed cattle are not to be
reckoned with for two months or more,
and it is possible that the January
market may be more satisfactory than
has been anticipated. A few wheat
field cattle are starting from Kansas,
but volume of that movement for a
month or two will depend on the way
the market acts.
Hogs came in liberally today, 24,000
head here, and the ' market exhibited
its large capacity, buyers cleaning up
the supply , at prices-that averaged
steady with yesterday, w i tli so me thing
of s flourish at the finish late saiea
around 5 higher. , Top was $0.75, bulk
of sales $6.45 to $6.70, light weights up
to $6.60. Light bogs are selling' re
latively better, as compared with
with other weights, than last week.
Several years of light crops of corn in
Kansas City's territory, and the at-
37th Year Number 45'
lO People
of Pleasure
tendent discouragement to hog raisers,
are being reflected in lighter supplies -here
than at other markets, with a
corresponding keeness of competiton
and strong prices in efforts of packers
to keep their plants here busy.
Lambs sold weak to 10 lower today, .
sheep steady, receipts 11,000 head.'
Best lambs sold at $9.25, yearlings:
$7.90 to $8.25, some choice wethers
weighting 115 lbs at $7.00, a new high
price this winter, and ewes at $6.25. .'.
Sheep feeding districts which supply
this market are carrying a short numb
er this winter, but Northern markets
will be liberally supplied for a while
from the - Northern Colorado and.
Western Nebraska feeding districts,
wuich have more lambs and sheep ou
feed than ever before. -
