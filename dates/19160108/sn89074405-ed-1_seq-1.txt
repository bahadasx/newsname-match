RUSSIAN CLAIM
Of SUCCESS IS
NOT CONFIRMED
Reported Capture of Village
Disputed in More Recent
Berlin Statement.
HARD BLOWS ARE
STRUCK IN WEST
Teutons Described as Deliv
ering Attacks Which the
British Repulse.
London, Jan. 8.—The1 Russian of
tensive occupies the most important
place in news of the war, with the
capture of Czartorysk as the latest
achievement reported. The Russians
claim full possession of the village,
but the Austrlans deny they have ad- I
vanced further than the cemetery:
The Austrlans are apparently fight
iiig desperately in this region in an
effort to hold their positions as a
screen for Kovel, the link between
the Austro-German armies in Galicia
and those further north In the neigh
borhood of Pinsk, which is threatened
with envelopment as the result of the
Russian advance.
Berlin Report Late.
N'e.ws regarding Czartorysk must be
taken with reserve. A German report
dated later than that of the Russians
claims that all the lost ground has
been retaken. The town may become a
second Czernowitz which apparently
is untenable by either side.
Western Fight.
On the British front in the west the
Germans are delivering hard concert
ed attacks with great vigor near the
Lille-Armentieres railroad, but the
British are said to be holding their
positions.
London, Jan. 8.—Some idea of the
determined nature of the Russian
blow on the Bessarabian front Is con
veyed by Petrograd dispatches yester
day which state that the Russians for
50 hours concentrated 400 guns on the
Austrian positions at Cxernowitz as a
preparation for. an infantry attack.
Tire Russian communications do not
yet claim that Cxernowitz has fallen,
but dispatches from Gorman sources,
udmit the Teutonic position there is
critical.
It. is not yet clear whether the Rus
sian operations in this theater herald
a big general offensive movement of
all the Russian armies from the Bal
tic to the Rumanian border. The
fighting has been of the most bitter
character, according to both the Aus
trian and Russian reports. New pri
soners are being taken and the in
fantry engagements are largely in the
nature of hand-to-hand encounters.
The situation along other fronts lit
comparatively quiet.
The loss of a British submarine by
mischance of navigation off the
Dutch coast makes a total of eleven
Hritish submarines lost since the be
ginning of the war. A majority of
these however, have been of the
smaller type.
Inquiry Demanded.
An echo of General Sir Ian Hamil
ton's Important review of the Dar
danelles operations is found in a re
port published yesterday that Gen. Sir
Frederick Stopford, who was recalled
on account of his conduct in the Suv
le Bay operations, has demanded an
inquiry by the war office into the
whole circumstances of the landing of
troops In the Dardanelles.
In connection with the submarine
activity in the Mediterranean sea, an
Athens dispatch notes that alarm Is
felt there owing to the fact that none
of, the nine ships laden with grain
purchased in America has either ar
rived or been signalled.
Railway Open.
A dispatch to The Daily Mail from
Athens says:
"The railway from Berlin to Con
stantinople has been open since the
middle of December The resources
of Turkey are being methodically tap
ped, notably the great copper mines
near Diarbekr in Asiatic Turkey."
Churchill Given Command.
Major Winston Spencer Churchill,
former first lord of the admiralty,
who resigned his subsequent cabinet
post of chancellor ..of the Duchy of
Lancaster and went to the front with
his regiment, has been appointed to
command a battalion of Royat Scots
Fusiliers at the frontln France.

LESSUQUOR
IS CONSUMED
Under Government System
of Controlling Sales They
Fell About 60 Percent.
Regina, Sask., Jan. 8.—Liquor con
sumption in Saskatchewan has fallen
off 60 to 80 per cent under the gov
ernment system of controlling the
liquor sales, according to Sir Walter
Scott, premier of Saskatchewan, who
makes such statement in a letter to
the Manitoba Social Service league,
an organization backing prohibition
in Manitoba.
The premier is also of the opinion
that what liquor is now consumed in
Saskatchewan is of infinitely purer
quality than it was in the days of the
licensed hotels and liquor stores.
Liquor is now sold from 23 govern
ment stores, spread over the province.
In support of his contention that
the consumers of liquors are getting
purer liquor, the premier states that
the major portion of the stock of the
saloons, taken over by the province
when the present law became opera
tive was, on analysis, found to he
grossly adulterated.
"Official correspondence with the
Credit Men's association, and the
Northwest Travelers' association," the
premier says, "supports general tes
timony that the Saskatchewan hotel
accommodations are now much better
than in the day of the hotel bar. The
villages and towns complained against
this past autumn were fewer than for
merly—surprisingly few, in fact."
The premier encloses to the Mani
toba organization a letter indicative
of the contents of scores of others,
written by a threshing. machine own
er. The latter says he conducted his
machine nine weeks, and it was the
first time in his business career that he
did not have to deal with the whiskey
problem and drunken men. Not a
drunk man was seen during the en
tire run, and every member of the
crew had money saved up when the
season was over.
Premier Scott is enthusiastic over
th operations of the provincial legis
lation.
OIW OFFICIALS OUT OF WORK.

COVERS CASE OF
WILLIAM P. FRYE!
Vessel Was Sunk With loss
of American Lives—Small
Boats Not Safe.
Washington, Jan. 8.—Germany's
note accepting the American conten
tion that the placing of mere non
combatants in life boats, when the
prize is to be destroyed, is not, .under
all conditions, to be assuring them
a place of safety, was made public
by the state department.
The note is the latest communica

sailing ship William p. Fry®, Aale

garding the question of small boats.
for the sunken ship, and
tfor
arbltrat
ing disputed provisions of Prussian
American treaty.
Safety of Xon-Combatants.
The most important part of the
text relating to the sinking of ships
carrying contraband, and the safety'
of non-combatants, follows.
"Until the decision of the perman
ent court of arbitration the German
naval forces will sink only such
American vessels as are loaded with
absolute contraband, when the pre
conditions provided by the declaration
of London are present.
"In this the German government
quite shares the views of the Ameri
can'government that all possible pre
cautions be taken for the safety of
passengers and the crew of the ship
to be sunk.
"Consequently the persons found on
board of a vessel may not be ordered
Into life boats, except when the gen
eral conditions, that is to say the
weather, the conditions of the sea and
the neighborhood of the coasts afford
absolute certainty that the boats will
reach the nearest port. For the rest
the German government begs to point
out that in cases where the German
naval forces have sunk neutral ships
for carrying contraband, no loss of
life has yet occurred."
Germany, however, declined to have
commissioners who will settle the
Frye damages meet in Washington,
because, it is pointed out, that the
German expert, Dr. Grove of Bremen,
director of the North German Lloyd,
would be exposed to danger of cap
ture during the voyage to America,
"in consequence of the condition of
maritime war by England, contrary
to International law."
It is suggested that the German
and American experts might get in
touch by correspondence.

Washington, Jan. 8.—Negotiations
between United States and Germany
over tbe Lusitania incident have vir

This became apparent following the
receipt of the two communications
from Germany through Count von
Bemstorff, German ambassador, one
offering to pay indemnity for the loss
of American lives In the Lusitania
disaster, and the other conveying as
surances regarding the conduct of
submarine warfare.
Causes Gratification.
The latest turn in negotiations
caused gratification in official circles,
and relieved to a great extent the
tension over the entire submarine
question.
Austria already has given assur

and it is expected that Turkey and
Bulgaria will give similar guarantees.
Probably Will be Accepted.
Indications are that German pro

accepted by the United States, practi

bring the controversy to an end is
the wording of the agreement.
Officials are still without details

massed on the bridge leading across the river, ready
to repel the threatened invasion of strikers. The men
are armed with revolvers and rifles.
A charge of 50 pounds of dynamite has been plac
