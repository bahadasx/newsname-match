To the Voters and Taxpayers of Grant
Parish.
Fairmount, Jan. 3, 1916.
When I first announced as a
candidate for the office of Assess
- or of Grant parish it was my in
itention to make a thorough and
e complete canvass of- the parish
and present my candidacy to each
individual in person. I have
found that it was impractical to
v do this, on account of a great
n deal of my time being taken up
]gathering and marketing my
crops and sickness in my family.
d Therefore I take this method of
presenting my candidacy for your
consideration.
I have stated repeatedly that
if elected I will make a personal
canvass of the parish in making
o assessments, or send a deputy
t who is acquainted with property
values and competent to make a I
proper assessment of your prop
erty, and I make this a pledge.
I belong to no political clique
or faction and am making this
race strictly on my own merits,
and it will be my earnest endeav
or to make a fair and impartial
assessment, and in doing so I
shall be guided .by the law of
right and justice between man
and man. The law fixes the du
ties of the Assessor, and if elect- r
ed I shall track the law and dis
charge my duties fearlessly and ,
without favor.
For the benefit of some who I
may not be personally acquainted r
with me, I will state that I am a
native of Grant parish and a man
of family, and own a small tract t
tract of land on which I make my t
living. I have also held various
clerical public positions, among c
them being deputy sheriff, depu
ty clerk of court and deputy as
sessor, and am fully competent
to perform the duties of the As- t
sessor and keep the records in ac
neat and systematic way. e
I will endeavor to see as many
voters as possible between now
and January 25th, but should I j
fail to see any in person I ask
that you make inquiry as to my
ability and give my candidacy fa- a
vorable consideration when you p
go to cast your ballot. is
Soliciting your support and as- e
suring you that it will be appre
ciated,
Very respectfully, C

Milton on Virtue.
I cannot praise a fugitive and clcis- B
tered virtue, unexercised and un- V
breathed, that never sallies out and
sees her adversary, but slinks out of
the race where that immortal garland n
is to be run for. not without dust and L
heat.-John Milton

Nctalies Liable to Fines.
New Orleans, Dec. 21. --Let
ters were addressed on Dec. 15
last, by Assistant Attorney Gen
eral Gamble to thirty-nine nota
ries public whose names had been
furnished by Secretary S. F.
Mathews of the Charity Hospital
as "apparently" having failed to
comply with the recordation act.
This act provides that vhere a
t notary fails to record the acts
passed before and by him within
forty-eight hours after he has
passed such act, such notary
must pay a fine of $500 for each
offense of the kind, such fines to
go toward the support of the
Charity Hospital.
According to the number of
offenses of this character charg
ed by Mr. Mathews to the thirty
nine notaries public named by
him, the Charity Hospital will, if
it is successful in collecting the
total amount, realize two or three
times as much as was realized
from the Chif enterprise. The
total of fines which Mr. Mathews
shows, should be collected from
one notary alone, is $12,500. An
other notary, who might possibly
scrape up $10, is alleged to owe
$10,000 of fines of this character.
Some of the most prominent
notaries in the city, and lawyer
notaries are on the list of thirty
nine. It is said that the act
makes no allowance whatever for
legal holidays, or dies non, makes
no reference to such, in requir
ing that all acts shall be recorded
within forty-eight hours after
they are passed. On dies non
the office of the recorder of acts
is not open; and further, it is
closed half a day on Saturdays.
Cold Weather Aches and Pains.
Many aches and pains, sore muscles,
stiff Sjoints and much rheumatism at
tributed to cold weather have their first
cause in failure of the kidneys to prop
erly eliminate waste matter from the
system. Foley Kidney Pills tone up
weak and diseased kidneys, giving
prompt relief from aches and pains.
