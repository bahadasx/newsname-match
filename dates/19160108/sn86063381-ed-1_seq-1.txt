GRADE STUDENTS
IN BIRD HOUSE
BUILDINGCONTEST
Sixth, Seventh and Eighth Depart
ments in Manual Training
to Compete.
STRUCTURES TO BE
EXHIBITED IN APRIL
Will Help Scholars to Understand
Importance of Preservation of
Certain Birds.
Professor A. D. Bailey, instructor
of the manual training department
of the local schools, has begun a con
test for the' construction of bird
houses. Every scholar of the sixth,
seventh and eighth grades, who take
manual training will compete for
prizes. It is expected that over 100
houses will be constructed. Prizes
to the amount of amout $30 will be
distributed among the contestants.
50 Last Year.
A similar plan of the construction
of bird houses was adopted last year
with much success. There were
about 50 houses constructed and the
houses were installed by many people.
In a majority of cases, it was report
ed that the houses were occupied by
birds.
Types Are Varied.
This year's contest was launched
this week when Prof. Bailey gave
the first instructions in planning and
building the houses. The types of
structure will be varied. Some of
the structures will be one story
while others will be two and three
stories. Not only places for nesting
will be made but food shelters from
winter weather will be erected.
Is Good Lesson.
"In addition to the training in
building the houses, the contest will
be highly beneficial to the students
as it will teach them the useful va
riety of birds and the harmful spe-
cies," said Prof. Bailey this morn
ing. "This knowledge which they
will unconsciously absorb during the
ton test will-help them to understand
what importance the preservation of
eertain'junds of birds and the ex
tinction of other kinds, really is. In
this way they will learn to harbor
and care for the insect destroyers
and exterminate the ones which con
stantly damage crops. This view of
the contest is in my estimation equal
ly important with the actual house
building."
Lumber Donated.
The material for the houses will
be common inch and half-inch lum
ber cut in the local mills. Copper
and tin sheeting will be used as
roofing. Two hundred feet of lum
ber has been supplied the manual
training department by each the
Crookston Lumber company and the
Smith-Robinson Lumber company.
Displayed at Store.
The houses will be placed on ex
hibit in one of the store windows for
the public's inspection after the
prizes have been awarded. The dis
play will be ready in April.
Prizes Are Good.
Prize money will probably be dis
tributed as follows: Ten dollars to
each grade with three dollars for
first prize, two dollars for second
prize and one dollar for third prize
and four dollars for other prizes.
NO SERVICES AT
CHURCH IN JANUARY
No church services will be held in
St. Bartholomew's Episcopal church

to the absence of Archdeacon H. F.
Parshall. Rev. Parshall will leave

points in Massachusetts where he
spent his youth and which he has
not visited for many years. He will
be gone about a month, returning

Tri-county Tuberculosis Retreat to.
Be Ready for Occupancy in
Several Months.
CONSTRUCTED AT A
COST OP $46,000
State Shares Fund With Counties of
Beltrami, Hubbard and
Koochiching.
The new tri-county tuberculosis
sanatorium at Lake Julia is nearing
completion and will be ready for oc
cupancy in several months.
Under State Act.
The sanatorium is being con
structed at a cost of $45,000. This
sum is shared by the state which
pays one-half and by the three coun
ties of Beltrami, Hubbard and Koo
chiching which jointly pay the re
maining portion. The contract was
let and the site chosen under the
state sanatorium law of 1913.
Have Large Building.
The law provides that any county
with the approval of a majority of the
county commissioners may construct
a hospital for tuberculosis patients
and share the expense equally with
the state. At a meeting of the coun
ty commissioners of the three coun
ties named above it was decided to
join forces for the construction of a
joint sanatorium. The action was
taken to secure a larger building and
a greater apportionment from the
state.
18 Miles From Bemidji.
The building is situated on the
north shore of Lake Julia, two miles
from Puposky, the nearest railroad
station, and 18 miles from Bemidji.
The site occupies 90 acres of very
beautiful land bought from, the Red
Lake railroad at $15 an acre and has
a large stretch of lake frontage.
Care for Thirty.
The capacity of the building is
thirty with special wards for the at
tention, of advanced^c^ies.. In addi
tion to the apartments fcr patTents
there are plenty of spacious rooms
for help and nurses. The building
has two floors and a basement. Wil
liam Murphy & Son are the archi
tects.
Prettiest in State.
Special attention is being paid to
the improvement and parking of the
grounds. A fund specially desig
nated for that' purpose has been set
aside. The location with the im
provements as proposed is one of the
prettiest in the state.

FOR'MOVIE'SCENE
'Mutual Traveler" Central Figure in
Pictures Taken at Looal

SCENES ARE WONDERFUL
HERE, SATS YOUNG LADY
Pictures May Be Shown at Local
Theaters in Several Weeks of
Lumbermen.
Miss "Mystery Maid" was in Be
midji today. She, is the "Mutual
Trayeler," under her official title,
and is connected .with the Mutual
Moving Picture company. While
here several hundred feet of film were
added to the films "See America
First," pictures taken in several
p^rts of the country.
War exigencies suggested the idea
of the film company Decause Seeing
Europe just now is rather a hazard
ous proposition. The "Mystery
Maid" will have toured almost the
entire United States before her work
is completed.
Yesterday she was at Kelliher
where pictures were taken of the
logging camps and the "tall uncut."
The "Mystery~Maid" had a complete
costume of lumberjack's togs for use
in the logging camp scenes.
Today pictures, were taken at the
Crookston mills and the "Mystery
Maid" walked logs, climbed timbers
and posed in the Crookston Lumber
company yards.
From Bemidji the "Mystery Girl"
and her party will go to New Or
leans. The party left at noon for St.
Paul.
What is your mental picture of a
movie girl, especially this "Mystery
Girl?"
Ever get "close up" to one?
A representative of the Pioneer,
did.
He found her just returning from
the Crookston Lumber company. The
idea of a main of mystery being eth
eral vanished immediately. She was
to" the^replesentattve a"gotf8 looking
normal youngs woman who enjoys
her work.
Enjoyable Country.
"Bemidji is certainly in an en
joyable country," she said. "The
scenes are most interesting although
the thermometer does not agree with
those in New York or England. I
was born in England and since com
ing to this country have engaged my
services with the motion picture com
pany as a traveler. In all my tours
through this country I have never
seen a rustic section, in fact, in read
ing of the scenes of the Northwest
and Alaska I hardly dreamed of such
an open world and really cold terri
tory in (xistence. It is the first time
in my career I could watch the stars
glittering about perpetually. As far
as the pictures are concerned I cer
tainly fell down enough to make
them the best ever.
In Love With Work.
"Who am I? Now, you .would
not spoil the mystery part of my
work, would you? Please do not
make me tell you who I am. I am
working for a salary, am thoroughly
in love with my profession and that
my husband"
It will probably be several weeks
before the pictures are shown at the
theaters here.
