Germany Agrees to Pay Indemnity
for Loss of American Lives in

WILL RESTRICT SUBMARINES
Also Accepts Contentions of United

Fate of Rev.
H. R. Salisbury.
Some members ni the cabinet
are urging President Wilson, after
,i. i? I l?
till. I CI Md UM llrt> UCl.ll
to ask all the Teutonic allies to
agree definitely that 110 unarnid
ships with Americans aboard shall
be destroyed until passengers and
crew have reached a place of
safety.
Administration officials were represented
today as being; much satisfied
with the assurances presented yesterday
by Count won Bernstorff, the German
ambassador, and in the light of j
those assurances such cabinet officers
^ who are in favor of the move believe
a request to the other allies might
well be based. It would include all
the Teutonic allies and would be expected
to close up the question of submarine
warfare. President Wilson is
considering the idea and is said to
think well of it. so far.
WashingtonianNot Among Survivors >
Confirmation of reports that Rev. j
Homer R. Salisbury of this city, an j
American citizen, was a passenger on j
the steamer Persia, sunk in the M.edi
tcrranean. was received today by the !
State Department from Consul General j
Gauiiu at Marseille. France. Mr. Sal- }
jsoury arrived at .Marline on me uoai I
train from Boulogne and took passage j
on the Persia, the dispatch said. His ;
name does not appear among survivors.
Authorities at Marseille and agents j
of the P. and O. line there have no I
record of passengers who arrived on j
the boat train, as they held Dondon
permits, the consul said, and were not
booked at Marseille.
Berlin Admits Contentions
Filed by the United States
in Presenting the Frye Case ;
Germany's note accepting the American
contention that the mere placing
of noncombatants in lifenoats when
a prize is to be destroyed is not under
ail conditions to be considered assur- j
ing them a place of safety was made i
public today by the State Department.
The note is the latest coiajpunication
over the sinking of the Aapfcb'ican sailing
ship William P- l*Tye, h.nd oesides
making the important concession regarding
the question of small boats,
lakes up the question of ay indemnity
tor the sunken ship, and for arbitrating
the disputed provisions of the
IT ussian-American treatx.
Safety of Non-Combatants.
The most important part of the text
relating to the sinking of ships carry- i
nig contraband ami the safety of nun- :
combatants follows: j
' i'ntil the decision of the permanent 1
court of arbitration, the German naval j
forces will sink only such American)
vessels as are loaded with absolute !
n urn mr preconditions j
p; ovided by the declaration of London I
are present. j
"In this the German government quite
shares the view of the American gov- j
e: uinent that all jtossible care must be!
taken for the security of the crew and |
passengers of a vessel to he sunk j
Consequently, the persons found on)
board of a vessel may not be ordered 1
into her lifeboats except when the j
general conditions, that js to say. the
weather, condition of the sea and the
neighborhood of the coasts afford ahsolute
certainty that the boats will
j eacli the nearest port. For the rest !
t>ie German government begs to point
out that in cases where German naval i
forces have sunk neutral vessels for
carrying contraband no loss of life has
yet occurred."
Declines Meeting In Washington.
Gerinayiy declined, however, to have
the commissioners who will settle the
Krye damages meet in Washington,
because it is pointed out that the German
expert. I>r. Greve of Bremen, director
of the North German Lloyd.
v* on lei in; exposed to danger of capture
during a voyage to America "in
consequence of the conduct of maritime
war by Kngland contrary to international
laws." it is suggested that
t n ; German and American experts
might get in touch by correspondence.
Germany also declined to assent at
this tune to the nomination of an ump
-1 e .? the absence of a determination
of whether the experts would settle
damages or principles Germany rei;ses
to have an umpire consider the
question of principle. In case the
rated States insists that the experts
meet in Washington and that an urnlitre
be named at once, Germany suggests
that the damages be arranged by
diplomatic negotiation.
Proposes Special Court.
For the arbitration of the f'russianAmencan
treaty Germany, in the note,
proposes a special court of five from
the permanent court at The Hague, of
'which each country shall choose two
and the four shall choose the fifth, to
meet at The Hague June lf>. The special
court would decide whether, under
the Prussian-American treaty, "the
belligerent contracting party is prevented
from sinking merchant vessels
of the neutral contracting party for
carrying contraband, when such sinking
is permissible according to the general
principles of international law."

SOON TO DRAFT BILL
TO END 'HALF' PLAN
Mr. Rainey to Begin Work
Next Week, Embodying Select
Committee Report.
CHANGE IN TAX RATE
SEEMS ALMOST CERTAIN
I
Repeal of Organic Act of 1878 and
Payment of Interest of 3.65
Bonds Important Features.
Representative Raincy of Illi-i
nois. secretary of the joint select j
committee which drafted the rc- !
cent report on the fiscal relations! (
between the District and the
United States, intends early next ]
week to start work on a draft of
a hill following the recommendations
of the report.
The bill will provide for the repeal of
the organic act of 1STS. will provide for
the payment of the interest on the 3.65
bonds on the half-and-half principle,
as recommended, and will endeavor to I
incorporate an outline of a plan for a j
tax rate system that will cover those
expenses of the District which are to 1
be ascribed simply to municipal activi- <
ties and not to the fact that the city is
national capital size and is a seat of j
national government.
The rate may be more or less than the
present rate. That has not been determined.
but it is likely the Rainey ^
bill will place the power of fixing- the .
fax rate in the hands of the Commis- *
sioners: but the>e will also be a safe- ?
guard against/'over or under taxation.
This, it is planned, will he through a J
scientific study of the taxes of other
^citines of sizes comparable with the f
Y)istrict of Columbia.
1
May Be Indorsed by Others. ^
The Rainey bill may have the in- .
dorsement of the other two House *
members of the committee: and if so. g
it will be the bill which Representative Page,
chairman of the appropriations *
committee. will endeavoY to have <_
placed in the appropriation bill by
special ruie. if needs be. He will have t
to get a special rule, because it will j .
certainly be killed by a sharp point, of I
order from Representative Johnson of
Kentucky or Representative Crisp of
Georgia.
The latter congressmen are understood
to be contemplating various bills t
aimed to bringing the joint committee
recommendations into line with their 8
own views. A
Repi csentative Crisp of Georgia, who t
uwes the District of Columbia's affairs v
an campaign fodder in his own distiict. *
and who promised to work for the abolition
of the half and half plan, as a c
plank in his congressional platform, c
will endeavor to impose a further tax
on the District through the introduc- 1
tion of a bill to tax personal intangible t
property. He wiil do this, it is under- j
stood, regardless of the unanimous re- ,
port of the congressional investigating
committee that the District is now
t!?Tpfl fnirlv
Gives Position of U. S. f
Sneaking of the general matter today, t
Representative Sherley of Kentucky, 5
who has always given a study to mum- .
cipal affairs ,in his own city of Louis- j
ville. as well as of Washington, said:
"There need be no fear ever that Con- 0
Kress will relinquish its interest in the r
city of Washington.
"The fact that this is the seat of gov- .
ernment is the important thing to C01:- ^
gress. The municipal feature is the inci- ^
dent: the seat of government the main j
feature. Congress does not want to give l;
up all control over this capital, and there- x
fore will not give up all financial support." ^
Representative Johnson may introduce ?
a bill fo annul section i of the organic act.
which is the half and half paragraph, and
then write into the proposed law the proposals
in the committee report.

LONDON*. January 8.?The
Russian offensive still occupies
lie most important place in the
lews of the war. with the captire
of Czartorysk as the latest
ichievement reported. The Russians
claim full possession of the
ullage, but the Austriates deny i
hey have; advanced any further i

The Austrians apparently arc1
igliting desperately in this region

irmies in Galicia and those
artber north in the neighborhood
>f Pinsk. which is threatened with
envelopment as a result of the
Russian advance.
Russ Stone Wall Offensive.
Dealing with the situation in Russia,
he Times Retrograd correspondent
ays that in the Czernowitz region the
tustrians' savage counter attackH shater
themselves mainly against the
tone wall of the Russian offensive.
"The righting in the Styr region." the
orrespondent adds, "threatens to in
rease lti fierceness and obstinacy as
he Russian advance develops, seeing
hat the Austro-Germans are tenaciousy
hanging on to the region of RafaDvka.
Czar's Losses 50,000, Is Claim.
Russian losses 011 the Bcssarabian j
rontier and the Stripa region during j
he New Year fighting were at least
0,000, according to the latest official
Lustrian statement.
Some idea of the determined nature 1
>f the Russian blow on the Bessa- j
ablan front is conveyed by J'etrograd ;
lispatches which state that the Rus- !
ians for fifty hours concentrated 400 j
uns on the Austrians' positions at '
'sernowitz, as a preparation lor an
nfantry attack. The Russian communcations
do not jet claim that (Jzerrio.
vitz has fallen, but dispatches from
ierman sources admit the Teutonic polition
there is critical.
Russ Plan Not Clear.
- - - - J
It is not yet clear whether the Russian
operations in this theater herald
t big general offensive movement o- all
he Russian armies from the Baltic to
the Rumanian border or merely indicate
a divers on of unparalleled maglitude
and fierceness designed to weaken
the pressure of the central powers
n the Balkans and incidentally on the
Italian front. The fighting has been of
:he most bitter character, according- to
>oth the Austrian and Russian reports.
Kew prisoners are being taken and the
nfantrv engagements are largely in
he nature of hand-to-hand encounters.
All of the Russian operations thus far
evealed are being pressed along the
ailway lines, which simplify the problems
of the winter supply of food, ammunition
and fuel.

of dynamite has been placed beneath'
j the bridge and a wire made ready to 1
, carry a current to set off the blast and j
j blow up the bridge the moment a mob i
starts across. A notice has been posted '
to this effect and all persons warned j
away from the bridge. Damage to
property had been threatened iri
Struthers.
How the Trouble Started.
The trouble began late yesterday j
when the day shift at the plant of the
Youngstown Sheet and Tube Com-J
pany quit for the day. The plant is j
located on the flats of the Mahoning!
river, several hundred feet from the
hillside on which is built East Youngs-j'
town, where most of the workmen live. ;<
The mills are reached from the town i|
by a high bridge spanning the railroad
yards, which has been carefully |
guarded by private watchmen since .
the laborers at the plant several days' ,
ago joined the laborers of the Republic ,
Iron and Steel Company and other j
mills for an advance of -5 cents ujj
day. '?
A crowd of men and women estimat- if
ed at L'OO had gathered at the East j
Youngstown end of the bridge, and s
jeered the workmen as they crossed. I?
Suddenly a shot was fired, and guards I
taking this as a signal fired over the i
heads of the crowd. The mob replied,
and another volley came. A number of
persons, including two women, fell
to the street, and the mob broke and
ran up the hillside. A block away
they reformed and almost immediately
set fire to the building occupied by the
tube company's employment ^ureau. A

and then turned their attention
to private property.
Mob Raids Nearest Saloon.
A saloon stood on the corner, and a
rush was made for the door. In a
minute a shouting- crowd filled the little
room and helped themselves to
what they saw. When" the looting was
complete the match was applied, and
the mob went wild. Ivauffrnan's clothing
store nearby was next entered, and
the stock passed out to the constantly
growing: crowd in the street by those
inside. Clerks fled for their lives, an?l
when the looting was finished, the
place was fired
By this time the mob was in a frenzy
.Men danced and sang and women '
joined them. Liquor was passed
around as freely as water, and thos>
who had no cups scooped it up in the
hollows of their hands, for within
half.an hour other saloons had been
looted and th? Are was spreading tapidly.
Wilson avenue, the main street, parallels
the railroad traces at the foot
of the hill, and streets lead out of it
tip the hill to the residence district.
For fully an hour or more the iiwhi
was content with the small shops and
saloons on the side streets, hut then it
turned its attenion to the more pretentious
stores on Wilson avenue.
Mob Without Leadership.
By this time it had lost ail semblance
of leadership, auri. splitting up
into bands of a dozen or more went
madly about tiie work of destruction.
Saloon after saloon was broken into,
looted and fired, the flames spreading
to the other business blocks on t h?
street. Fanned by a strong wind, the
lire tore its way up the hill, and many
residences, some occupied by the rioters,
were burned.
Mayor W- U. Cunningham and tiie ten
policeman who make up the protective
force of the village early realized the
situation was beyond them and gathered
at the police station at the west
end of the business district or wantiered
along the streets, unable 10 do
anything.* Sheriff J. C. I'instead earlier
in the evening had been blinded temporarily
by red pepper thrown in his
eyes by a rioter, and later conferred
with Mayor Cunningham, who admitted
he was unable to stop the rioting. This
condition the sheriff reported to Cen.
Speaks, who had been sent to look over
the situation, and to Lieut. Col. Charles
Wev brecht of Alliance, who accompanied.
It was then the call was sent
for state troops.
Fire Hose Cut to Pieces.
Meantime the rioting; had been In
progress for several hours, and it was
seen that |he business section could
not be saved. Every minute the crowd
seemed to grow until there were hundreds
of drink-crazed men and women
roaming the streets. The fire department
had been called out at the first
alarm of fire, but the hose was quickly
i'ut to pieces, and, helpless, they called
on the Youngstown fire department.
Jhief Joseph Wallace had men and
squipment ready to send from the city,
hut found it was useless to risk lives
ind property as long as the mob had
:he town. Scenes of the wildest disorder
were everywhere enacted, and the
Ires mounted higher and higher until
oward 10 "o'clock Wilson avenue, the
intire length of the village was iu
lames. Absolutely no attempt was beng
made to extinguish the flames or
save the thousands of dollars in prop;rty
being carried away or destroyed.
Early in the evening the mob had attacked
the post office. It was a small
building, and the dozen or more men
who entered it made short work of it.
Additional excitement, if such were
possible, was created by the report that
the mob had dragged the safe into the
street and blown it to pieces. Eater it
was slated that the men had been content
with robbing the stro^p box be
