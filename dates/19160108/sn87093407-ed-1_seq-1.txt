Half of Seattle may be without water be
fore night.
For two days and two night* a crew of
water department workers have been fight
ing to repair a 150-foot cave-in in the big
wooden conduit pipe that is the only feeder
from Cedar lake to Seattle.
It is feared that a water famine cannot
be prevented. Because the auxiliary line
is being rebuilt, Seattle has had to depend
upon the one seven-year-old wooden pipe
line to bring in water.
The snow and ice, and general weather
conditions have put the pipe in poor condi
tion. Further cave-ins are expected.
The water department Saturday issued
a warning requesting that everybody use as
little water as possible during the next 24
hours, so as to conserve the supply.
Mayor Gill said that the old pumping
station on Lake Washington is still hooked
up ana could be pressed into service if neces-
•ary as a last resort.
"There is no danger of the whole city be
ing left without water/' he said. "If the
emergency demands it the Lake Washington
pumping station can supply a great area of
the low districts. We would rather, however,
that the people economize in their water for
a short time, when the danger probably will
be past.
If the water department's stren
uous efforts to patch up things are
successful. Seattle will be tempor
arily out of danger Sunday night.
Fear Further Damage
But other cave Ins as a result of
the melting snow are feared.
The first water users to feel the
effects of the water famine will he
those obtaining service from what
Is known ss the intermediate dis
trict.
This Includes the residents of
Capitol Hill. Madrons Heights.
I.esi hl Heights. South l'ark. Rainier
Park. Green Ijike and Beacon Hill
Get Water From Reservoirs
All of Seattle has been fed by
the one pipe line, which Is tempor
arily out of commission If there
are more cave-Ins. or the present
break Is not repaired, the city will
really be dry.
While the repairs are made. the
city is getting its water from the
reservoirs lhat were full at the
time of the break.

"There Is no reason for immedl^-,

Chief Clerk Schunke advised

Lay in Small Supply
The people who live in th«
higher parts of the city would do
well to lay up a small supply of
water —enough to carry them a
day or so." he said.
The broken pipe line is about
seven years old.
"It should still be in good condi
tion, according to the engineers."
said Mayor (1111 Saturday. "The
other line has been permitted to
run down. It was neglected right
after my recall, and when 1 took
office, the matter came up and wo
decided to rebuild it. There waa
no reason to believe that the other
pipe line would not hold up."
