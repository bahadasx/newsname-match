Two hundred and ten members of the
Henry Ford peace expedition will
reach the Hague at 11. o'clock Satur­

The arrangements so far made for

"This legation will be delighted to
extend to the Ford party as private
citizens, travelling abroad, all the
courtesy to which they are entitled.
They will have the opportunity to see
some of the treasures of Dutch paint­

Tension Regarding Submarine
Situation Is Relaxed Says
Washington.
OFFICIALS GRATIFIED
AT TURN OF AFFAIRS
Promise Made That Submarines
Will Operate Under Interna­
tional Laws.
•Washington, Jan. 7.—Two commu­
nications from Germany reached
the United States today—one con
taining a proposal to pay an indemni­
ty for the Americans lost in the Lu
sHania disaster, which may bring no
Reflations on the subject, to a conclu­
sion, and the other conveying assur­
ances that German submarine com
nianders operating in the Mediterra
nean would not. torpedo non-combat­
ant ships Without warning them and
affording safety to their passengers
and crews.
The communications were deliver­
ed to Secretary Lansing by Count
von Bernstorff.
Near Final Settlement.
Official Washington tonight consid­
ered that America and Germany at
last were near a final agreement re­
garding the conduct of submarine
warfare.
Officials made no attempt to con­
ceal their gratification over the atti­
tude Germany has assumed. It was
considered to be virtually in har­
mony with the American viewpoint.
Tension regarding the entire sub­
marine question seemed to have less­
ened considerably. Austria in reply
to the last Ancona note, having in­
sured the United States of its inten­
tion to operate submarines with re­
gard to international law and human
it/, Turkey and Bulgaria, it is under­
stood, next will take steps to give
such guarantees, it is stated author
itati^ely.. that. Gentiany and Austria
will lise their influence to accomplish
this end.
Will Pay Indemnities.
The Lusitania controversy, except
for the wording of the agreement to
be entered into, is considered, in
Teutonic circles here, virtually end­
ed.
Under the terms of the proposals
submitted for the approval of tiu
United States, 'Germany, while offer­
ing to pay an indemnity makes the
reservation that no admission of
wrong thereby is admitted. It is
contended that the Lusitania was
sunk as an act of reprisal.
Won't Molest Americans.
The state department, was advised
today by Ambassador Shock, at Par­
is, that the French government had
ordered the captain of the cruiser.
Descartes to act with great care ami
circumspection and not to stop any
more American vessels. The cruiser
recently stopped three in Port Rican
waters and removed Germans, who
have since been released.
An Act of Reprisal.
It is contended that the Lusitania
was sunk as an act of reprisal for
the British blockade of Germany.
While Secretary Lansing is under­
stood to have not indicated to Count
von Eernstorff whether the "proposal
was satisfactory, several officials in
a position to be familiar with the
American attitude indicated that il
would be accepted.
Consideration of the German as
surances and of the apparent atti­
tude of Austria as reflected in dis
patches from Ambassador Penfield at
Vienna, led officials to helieve thar
the sinking of the Persia might not
result in differences so grave as at
first were feared.

Submits Memorandum to Presi­

Conditions.
Washington, Jan. 7.—Secretary
Reddeld, in a memorandum on busi­
ness conditions, transmitted to Pres­
ident Wilson today, pictures the
country as in the most prosperous
state of its history. The warning is
added, though, that inflation of com­
merce will last only until the war's
end and that business foresight alone
will prepare the United States for
peace.
The slump that will follow the war
abroad, the secretary's summary de­
clares, must find Americans ready to
take their share of the world's trade.
It. is not. to be expected," the sec­
retary says, "that our business move­
ments will continue in its present
form. No one dreams that we can

It is impossible for no other reason
than because the world has not the
power to pay to any one nation such
vast sums for any long period in ad­
dition to the waste of war."
Opportunities for a normal pros­
perity after the war are outlined, the
secretary pointing out that the Unit­
ed States has jumped to first place
among the nations in international
trade.
Whether we shall retain first
place," the memorandum continues,
depends on the energy of our bank­
ers, manufacturers and farmers.
Both financial power and effective
means of using that power are in our
possession. Together they may form
a basis of commercial and financial
opportunity."

The most recent battle on the cast-

scale, is developing where the fron­

The heaviest Russian attack on the
Austrian lines, which here still prac­

Six Blocks in the City Bunted

Residence Seetion.
Youngstown, Ohio, Jan. 7.—-Thrtt
men were killed, more than twenty
persons wounded, six city blockf of
buildings burned, with a lots of
000, and three regiments fo state
troops called out to restore order, at
the result of rioting in East Youngs*
town tonight, following a battle lp*
tween a crowd of strike sympathizers
and armed guards, at the plant of ths
Youngstown Sheet A Tube company.
BLOW UP BRIDGE.
The bridge from East Youngstown
to Struthers was burned to,prevent
rioters from entering the town. Be­
sides the state troops, two .c^mpanisi
of United States regulars .from Col­
umbus are reported to have been er
dered to East Youngstown beeause ef
the looting and burning of the, poet
office.
The trouble started early this motlt
ing when si.rike sympathizers and
workers at the Sheet and Tube plants
clashed. Stones were thrown an.l
several shots fired, but no one was in­
jured. Later in the afternoon a riot
occurred just outside the Tube com­
pany's plant and two men were BO
badly injured that they were taken
to a hospital.
Crowds Stone Police.
The most serious trouble started
tonight when a day shift at the Tube
mills left work. A crowd of 6,000
men gathered at the entrance to. the
works and stoned a squad of private
police in charge of Chief J. M. Woltz,
of the Sheet & Tube company force.
According to a statement made by
Woltz he fired a blank shot in the air
to scare the crowd and then the fir­
ing became general. Nineteen in the
crowd were wounded, following which
the mob swerved into the Youngs­
town business district and fired sev-,
eral buildings. As a torch was first
applied to a clothing store and jewel­
ry store, looting began. A saloon was
fired and looted, the liquor being dis­
tributed through the crowd.
Drive Firemen Away.
The Youngstown fire department
went to the scene of the fires, but
were driven off by the crowd. The
East Youngstown department also at­
tempted to check the blaze, but tu*
hose was cut and the firemen driven
away. The flames quickly spread and
at midnight were burning beyond
control.
Sheriff Umstead found the situation
beyond his control and asked that
state troops be sent here.
The first man killed was fatally
shot while attempting to loot a store.
The other two rioteris were killed in
a saloon fight.
