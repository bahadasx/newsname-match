lution Urging the Colored People to Divide Their Votes
Among the Two Great Political Parties in This Country
THAT THE NEGRO PRESS OF THIS COUNTRY MUST UEGE AND EN

SHIP OF THEIR NEIGHBORS AND TO JUDICIOUSLY USE THEIR
RIGHTS OF SUFFRAGE.
A RESOLUTION WAS ALSO PASSED DEEPLY DEPLORING THE DEATHS
OF THE LATE BOOKER T. WASHINGTON AND J. MILTON TURNER.
MEMBERS OF THE WESTERN NEGRO PRESS ASSOCIATION BELIEVE
THAT THIS COUNTRY SHOULD AT at.t. TIMES BE PREPARED FOR
WAR.
THAT THERE ARE MORE THAN TWO MILLION COLORED MEN IN
THIS COUNTRY CAPABLE OF BEARING ARMS WHO ARE WILLING
TO FIGHT TO THE END IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN THE HONOR OF
THIS COUNTRY AND TO ASSIST TO PERMIT OLD GLORY TO CON
TINUE TO FLY TO THE BREEZES.
THE NEXT MEETING OF THE ASSOCIATION WILL BE ttrt.ti in CHI
CAGO, JUNE 5TH AND 6TH, 1916.
The "Western Negro Press Associa
tion, held its 17th annual-,meeting -in
Kansas City, Mo., last week the meet
ing being -well attended by members
of the association from many points
in the "west and southwest, at the close
of the two days session.
A. J. Smitherman, editor of the Tul
sa Star was reelected president of the
Association as were all the other of
ficers except the late editor L. A. Bell,
former corresponding secretary. Edi
tor Thos. Kennedy, editor of the Kan
sas City Independent, at Kansas City,
Mo., was elected to this office.
The following resolution was adopt
ed by the Association:
Bo it resolved that the Western
Negro Press Association unqualifiedly
endorses reasonable preparedness for
war and believes that this government
should immediately make suitable prep
aration to protect its commerce and
citizens both home and abroad.
We believe that the two million Ne
groes capable of bearing arms should
be given an opportunity in all our
slates and territories to . obtain that
military training both as officers and
privates that is absolutely necessary
in a well organized government; and
to this end, we earnestly suggest that
the various states as well as the gov
ernment, put aside their prejudices to
ward the Negro and assist in train
ing and molding this tremendous force
into a splendid defensive machine.
The Negro has demonstrated his
bravery as well as loyalty upon many
a battlefield and can be trusted to
come to his Nation's defense at any
lime, that an emergency may arise.
We enthusiastically endorse the doc
trine enunciated by our greatest leader
whoso loss wo deeply deplore, the late
Booker T. Washington, whose slogan
"Back to the Farm" has found ready
response in the hearts of thousands of
Negroes who are now doing well cul
tivating the soil.
AVe also deplore the death of that
greatest diplomat of the. race J. Mil
ton Turner, who was tho father and
founder of the first Negro school in
CONGRESSMAN MARTIN B. MAD
DEN IS NOT OPPOSED TO THE
RE-ELECTION OF MAJOR ROB
ERT R. JACKSON TO THE LEGIS
LATURE OF ILLINOIS FROM THE
THIRD SENATORIAL DISTRICT.
Por somo time past; many of the
guttersnipe politicians, residing in the
first congressional district, have been
busily engaged in circulating the re

den, was bitterly opposed to the re
election of Maj. Robert R. Jackson, to
the legislature of Illinois from the

Missouri and who did much in .his
j-lifo -tkue for racial uplift
We view with pride the increasing
tendency on the part of the race to en
courage and patronize Negro Journals
and hope tho time will soon come when
the Negro newspaper will be found in
the home of every member of the race.
And Whereas it has been conclusive
ly shown that the race has friends as
well ast enemies in all the political
parties of this country, therefore,
Be It Resolved, the Negro Press of
this country be urged to admonish the
race everywhere to encourage and cul
tivate the good will of all our friends
in all the political parties and to show
their appreciation of the same by a
judicious use of their rights" of suffrage.
Be It Further Resolved, that a copy
of these resolutions be published in all
the Negro journals and a copy fur
nished the Associated Press.

Tho next annual meeting of the
Western Negro Press Association will
be held in Chicago, June 5th and 6th,
1916.
The editors composing the Western
Negro Press Association must be given
the great credit of setting forth some
sane and sound advice in their various
resolutions and if the Colored editors
and the members of the race residing
in all parts of this country would ad
here to the advice imparted to them
by those attending the Western Negro
Press Association and especially cling
to that part of it in relation to divid
ing their votes between the two great
political parties and at all times stick
to their friends whether or not they
are Democrats or Republicans they
would be ten thousand times better off
from a political point of view.
For more than twenty years we have
been urging the Colored editors every
where through the columns of this pap
er, to impart this same advice to the
readers of their respective newspapers
and we are exceedingly glad to note
that many of them are beginning to
follow in our foot steps.
third Senatorial district, which is not
the fact.
On the contrary Congressman Mad
den, states; that Maj. Jackson, has
made good at Springfield; that he must
and will receive a square deal at tho
hands of the party managers, in that
district; that he has authorized no one
to state that ho is working or plan
ning his undoing as a legislator and
it looks right now, as though it is all
over with Maj. Jackson, but the shout
ing and that when the votes are count
ed at the close of the primaries in
September he will bo the winner with
both hands down.

Would Buy Lincoln's Suit.
Washington, D. C. Congress has
been asked to appropriate $7500 to pur

coln wore the night of his assassina
tion in Ford's Theatre, in 1865.
Representative Roberts, of Massachu

ness man, for the Lincoln memorial.
Predicts Toppling of Wave.
Louisville, Ky. "The prohibition
wave, like any other wave, must top
ple at its crest," said T. M. Gilmore,
president, at tho annual meeting of the
National Model License League here.
"The crest was reached when a genu
ine prohibition bill became operative in
Arizona this year. As soon as the ef
fects of this drastic measure began to
be felt, the units of the prohibition

a wild effort to get back to normal I
conditions.
"Prohibitionists of Arizona are ap
pealing to the courts for a nullification
of the law, and to prospective lawmak
ers for its resubmission. The plea is
made that the voters thought they were
voting for such laws as prevail in Maine
and Kansas and other prohibition
states, wherein everybody may lawfully
obtain liquors for any purpose desired.
"The history of the prohibition wave
that rose so high and fell so far in
1855 is about to be repeated."
Observe Anniversary of Slavery Ending.
Boston, Mass. Tho Colored people
of Boston celebrated the fiftieth an
niversary of the promulgation of the
Thirteenth Amendment, which removed
recognition of slavery from the United
States Constitution, with a mass meet
ing in Faneuil Hall, following exercises
at the statues of two anti-slavery men,
Wendell Phillips and Charles Sumner,
last week, under the auspices of the
Massachusetts branch of the National
Independent Equal Rights League and
the Citizens Auxiliary Committee. Wil
liam D. Brigham, secretary of the
Wendell Phillips Association, speaking
at the mass meeting, called upon his
White brethren to see that "real jus
tice is done the Negro.' '
"The Thirteenth Amendment," he
said, "is very brief, consisting practi
cally of only three lines:
"Neither slavery nor involuntary
servitude shall exist within
the United States, or any other place
subject to their jurisdiction."
"This amendment recognized dark
skinned people as human beings. Dan
iel Webster said, 'That is property,
which the law declares to be property: '
but he did n'ot say what law nor whose
law. William H. Seward said in a
speech which he made March 11, 1850:
'There is a higher law than the Con
stitution. '
"No one can rightly appreciate the
tremendous progress of the Colored
race in this country unless in passing
he alludes- to the depths of wrong and
oppression from which the ascent as
been made. Today the Colored race
in this country have $700,000,000 worth
of property -and 20,000,000 acres of
farms, and the percent of illiteracy has
risen from 80 per cent at the close of
the war, to less than 30 per cent now."
Stands Up For Fifteenth Amendment.
One, at least, of the avowed candi
dates for the Republican nomination
for tho Presidency is squarely on rec
ord favoring the right of the Negro
to the ballot vouchsafed him by the
Fifteenth. Amendment to the Federal
Constitution. On April 18, 1903, Hon.
Henry D. Estabrook, of New York, who
CHIPS FAIX WHERE THEY MAY

r
is favorably mentioned for tho nomina-
tion, addressed a letter to the editor of
tho New York Sun which was published
on the editorial page of the Sun in
its issue of April 20th, 1903, discuss
ing the Fifteenth Amendment and tho
Negro's right to the franchise. In this
letter Mr. Estabrook said in part:
"Tho problem as put by a certain
element of the South is: How to elim
inate the Negro vote? Thus stated it
enlists neither my sympathy nor toler
ance. To the Negro, as such, ought
not to bo denied a voice in a govern
ment, of which, by virtue of numbers
and usefulness, he is so conspicuous a
part. The Fifteenth Amendment was
not a mistake. I am Christian enough
to believe that it was divinely or
dained. Repeal that Amendment and
you blot from our flag a star of hope,
and leave millions of people orphaned
of country and worse than slaves, for
they would have neither the ballot for
defense nor the protection of an own
er's self-interest in his property.
In a country like ours, dedicated to
personal liberty and self-government the
denial of political rights must be based
on just and fundamental distinctions.
So long as certain elements
of the South cling to the hallucination
that the worst of White men is better
than the best of the black men, so
long will the South suffer, and deservo
to suffer; for it is a false conceit, a
wicked conceit, an obsolete conceit, and
freedom in its march will not turn back
ward." '

Attorney of Cook County, has moved
back into the second ward, and he and
Mrs. Scott, will in tho future reside

were innocent of the offences charged.

DEATH OF MRS. ROBERT M. MIT
CHELL. On Thursday morning, Mrs. Robert
M. Mitchell, 3149 Prairie avenue; wife
of the late Attorney Robert M. Mit
chell, who passed away in September
1908; departed this life very suddenly
after being attacked by a severe case
of la grippe.
Mrs. Mitchell, was well known to all
the older citizens of Chicago. She was
a member of the Old Settler's Club
and one must reside in this city for
more than thirty years, before they
can become one of its members.
Mrs. Mitchell was a very lovable
woman. Funeral services will be held
over her remains at the Grace Presby
terian church, 34th and Dearborn streets
Monday morning at 11 o'clock. Rev.
Moses M. Jackson officiating. Dan M.
Jackson, 2961 S. State street; funeral
director in charge. Her remains will re
pose by the side of her late husband
in the family burial ground in Oak
wood cemetery.
Col. Edward H. Morris, who -very
successfully served for a long time, as
attorney for the "Gambler's Trust"
may be induced to run against Con-
gressman Martin B. Madden, to secure
the nomination for delegate to the
Republican National Convention from
the first congressional district. If CoL
Morris should decide to kick in to that
contest, he would be licked to a dead
standstill for he is among the most
unpopular men in Chicago.
