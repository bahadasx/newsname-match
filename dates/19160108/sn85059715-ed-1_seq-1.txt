FOR Till
Germans Claim, However, That
Teutons Have Regained All
the Ground Lost.
GERMANS ARE REPULSED
Both British and French Artillery
Are Busily Engaged
in the West Now.
( V ASSOCIATED PRESS)
June a.?iue nussmu
offensive still occupies the most Important
place In the news of the war
with the capture of Czartorysk as the
latest achievement is reported. The
Russians claim full possession of the
village but the Austrians deny they
have advanced any further than the
cemetery.
The Austrians are fighting desperately
in this region in an effort to
hold their positions as a screen for
Kovel and a link between the Austro-Clerman
urmles in Gallcia and
those further north in the neighborhood
of Pinsk, which is threatened
with envelopment as a result of the
Russian advance.
The news regarding Czartorysk
must be taken with reserve. A German
report dated later than that of
the Russians claims that all the lost
ground has been retaken. The town
may become a second Czernowitz
which apparently Is untenable' by
cither side.
On the British front in the West
the Germans have attacked near the
Lille-Armentlers railroad, but according
to official British advices
li n tin Koon rnnitlnorl Until IVin HVannh
and British heavy artillery were busily
engaged yesterday.
Constantinople reports the Allies
have again bombarded the narrows
from land and sea.

LONDON, Jan. 8'.-?As the first step
In his trip of Investigation into war
conditions in Europe, Colonel E. M.
House, personal repersentatlve of
President Wilson, saw Sir Edward
Grey, the British minister for foreign
affairs today.
No statement was given out regarding
the matters discussed and officials
of the government in declining
to talk regarding the meeting displayed
anxiety, that nothing be said
that would indlcnte that Colonel
House's call should be termed a conference
between the two men.
Colonel House edpartcd from his
bote lwithout leaving any word as to
his destination and it is expected that
he will spend the week end with a
party which will number among Its
L members several close advisers of the
British government. Colonel House
Is known to be awaiting advices from
Ambassador Gerard before definitely
planning a trip to Beriln. In the
meantime the next two weeks will bo

MESSAGED
IS TO BI
By Western Union for Few Days
So Far as European Countries
Are Concerned.
The Western Union Telegraph
Company announces that owing to a
temporary shortage of facilities It
will be necessary to suspend for a
few days the handling of trans-Atlantio
deferred messages. Every effort
will h* made to restore deferred ser
vice and cable letters at the earliest
possible moment and the public will
be promptly advised as soon as conditions
permit the restoration of
these services. The company states
that the necessity for this action la
greatly regretted but the suspension
of deferred service by other transatlantic
cable companies, some days
ago, has resulted In a flood of deferred
messages, some union oables
and It, therefore, becomes necessary
In order to protect the company's
regular patrons and Its own expedited
service to temporarily 'suspend all
| but the regular full paid service.
