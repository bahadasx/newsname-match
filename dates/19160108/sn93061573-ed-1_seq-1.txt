Not alone did Jack Weichmun do
his part to make the affair a winner.
The feminine coterie will long be
remembered as the brightest, hap
piest, best dressed crowd that ever
assembled at one function in Clay
ton. Most of the dresses were crea
tions. Many of the men bloomed
out in evening clothes and an air
of prosperity fairly radiated from
all. A menu consisting of live
courses was served in style entirely
in keeping with the rest of the show.
The Next Song was a Dance
Toast Master O. P. Easterwood
worked orators of the evening for all
they were worth. Capt. T. 8. Snyder
delivered an interesting talk on "Ob
jects of the Order," Joseph Gill
"What Masonry Means," Hugh H.
Woodward "Fraternity," Judge J. S.
Holland, "History of '".layton Lodge,"
H. J. Hammond Sr. "Eminent Ma
sons,"' I). W. Snyder "Everyday Ma
sonry," this in a humorous vein,
Morris C. Johnson made the closing
address and extended the invitation
for the crowd to repair to the ball
room at Palmer Hall where frivolity
reigned supreme. The orchestra
tooted its last toot at 4:55 a. m.
"Beauties of the Mystic Art
j. rraiiK uarnnarts address was
among the best of the evening. The
theme was unique and Mr. Ilarn-
hart delivered it in a semi-humorous
vein that proved popular with his
audience. Aside from a few pre
liminary remarks the speech follows
in full:
"Mr. Toastmastr, ladies and
brothers:
"As you state, Mr. Toastmaster,
that the time is short and as I see
so many orators here who are anx
ious to get upon their hind legs
and hold sweet converse with you
I will endeavor to take but very
little of your time.
"I dislike to start in by bragging
too much about you good people of
Clayton, but the fact remains that
when I see so many faces of those
who have helped to make this little
camping place beside a mud hole
on the vast prairies into the largest
little town I have ever seen it is
not unseeming to mention it.
"Hut my good friends, the work
was here to do and had we failed
to recognize our opportunities and
take advantage of them we would r,
have been remiss in our duty to
ourselves and to posterity, "for we
do our work in the world or we per
ish from it elso why cumber we the
earth," and the saving grace of man
is the fact that ho turns his face
to the dawn and reaches forth his
arms in a constant effort to grasp
the belter things of life and so wo
of Clayton are making this a better
placo to live in but heaven knows
there is yet moro work to do.
"There is still plenty of chance
for the knocker to knock and for the
optimist to spread his beautiful
wings and soar, but between these
two stand those bulwarks of safety:
the energetic, practical and leyel-
headed citizens who are making this
litllf city habitable. !

Sung Home, Sweet

Home." i

"When I look back ten years it
is difficult to realize that this is the.
mine town. It was then the wildest
and woolliest of the wild and woolly,
it was then that the stvect hum of
the roulette wheel and the gen'lc
click of the poker chip lent music
to the cadence of the foot steps of
our wives and children as they pass
ed along our main street and the
ominous bark of the playful "15"
sent the cold chills down our back
bone and hastened our footsteps to
ward home and safety, and the local
color at that time would have put
the pens of Owen Wister, Hret
Harte, O. Henry or flex Reach in
a frenzy of activity. The change in
the moral atmosphere is as light to
darkness but then we could not re
main as we were for we are living
in a great age. .My friends, I be
lieve that this is now the greatest
ige since the dawn or the Christian
; ra and if we but pause to relied
.ve must marvel at the stupendous
achievements along the lines of
constructive thought and action, a
;reat moral wave is ror one thing
sweeping over the United States to
lay that will not be denied; it has
sounded the knell of licensed wrong;
it is manifested in better educational
facilities, more practical currieu
lunis, economic national and civil
government, preventive and cura
tive medicine, surgery, bacteriology,
lectric achievement, higher ideals
in the home and hygenie methods of
living, the lessening of poverty and
crime, the passing of the ward heel

dice, broadening of religious views

not least. Temperance, and if It will

and if these ladies here present had

aiw tins is a trille strong for -a
man who likes a little booze occa
sionally as well as I do, but I am glad
that I can still see light through
ladder without a microscope. And
now, my friends, just as we are clos
nig me luieuue festivities to com
memorate the coming Into the world
of Him who was destined to have
such an influence upon the live of
men, it may be fitting to speak of
our order in its connection to those
valuable precepts handed down to
us by the lowly Na.arene.
"It was He who taught us the glor
ious meaning of "Peace on Earth,
good will toward men," and ad
monished us to "Love thy neighbor
as thyself." I suppose there is none
of us here but who have thought
the latter practically a human im
possibility but I think that He meant
to impress upon us the utter futility
of a selfish and sordid life to the ex
clusion of all the better things of
life, prostituting our God-given tal
uels for unsatisfying and ignoble
ends, abusing the houses in which
we live and ide in middle life, un
happy, unsatisfied, achievements un
sung, memnory unmounted and soon
forgotten.
I could give the names of many
men of prominence in the last decade
of this kind, but it is unnecessary.
Suftice to say that I am a believer'
in the theory that the world is
growing better, and I believe today
that there are more men of similar
talent for the accumulation of wealth
who let God's glorious sunshine
warm their souls and occasionally
pause in the fitful struggle to lend
a helping hand to a brother loss

advantage of tin law passed in 1915

alty and interest." said Fulgencio C.
de Haca, deputy treasurer and col
lector, "the county is now in poss
ession of many tax deeds that the
owners must pay interest for re
demption." Mr. de Haca says the 1915 law did
much to bring tax money into the
county for taxes as far back as 1905.

and one of the first men to settle in
Union county, according to a report
brought to Kenton by a rider and
telephoned to Clayton, was shot and
'. illed by an unknown person Friday
ifternoon. Officer Crumley, Justice
L. V. Kingdom and County
Phvsl-
eían Dr. Bristol left immediately in
an automobile for the Smith ranch
tla Kenton. -Through absence of any
wire connection between either Ken
ton or Clayton and Cie Smith ranch
we are unable to learn any oí the
details of the supposed murder. A
Iieneral air of mystery surrounds the
affair as it Is reported that no one
saw the crime committed, jet the
theory of suicide that was later re
ported wits promptly discredited al
though there U no basis by which
either story can he confirmed.

a jitney line from CTuylon to Gren
ville, Mt. Dora and Des Moines. Mr.

Wikoff Garage and made his first

to be a paying one as C. A. Merritt,

another -car to his equipment and
extended the line to Texhoma and
other points.
Since the C. Jc S. pulled off two
passenger trains from Clayton's

years ago.
