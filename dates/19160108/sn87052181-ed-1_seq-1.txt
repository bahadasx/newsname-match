ply $3,250,000 worth of ammunition.

ment on this order Is expected to be
under way the latter part of February.
One-half million dollars' worth of ma
chinery Is being Installed, preparatory
to turning out 250,000 cartridges a day.
Three hundred employes will operate

ings with a combined floor space of
about 40.000 square feet.
Most of the munitions made In this
country aro being turned out by fac

It Is Intimated that orders from the
