London, Jan. 7 10:32 p. m. The po

afte the overwhelming ... vote secured
by the government in the house of

reading of its compulsion bill.- The
reassuring size of the government's

gree the anti-conscriptlonist vote of

partly discounted by the attitude of
such Important - labor leaders as
Arthur Henderson, who resigned as
president of the board of education
and John Ward, George Nicoll Barnes
and John Hodge, members of the
house of commons.
The position of these men in this

too hasty and ill considered to be re
garded as reflecting the actual feel

Parliament did not meet today and
will not sit again until Monday. The
indications are that the conscription

HOT CRITICISM OP -
REPRESENTATIVE GARDNER.
For Attacking - German-Americans
During a Speech on .Munitions.
Washington. Jan. 7 J Hot Criticism
from three republican colleagues was
drawn by Representative Garoner oi
Massachusetts, in the house today
when he attacked German-Americans
during a speech on proposals for a
munitions embargo. Representative
Stafford gf Wisconsin and Longwortn
of Ohio, whose districts are . German
American centers. I denounced his
statements as unwarranted and par
ticularly improper at this time. Rep
resentative Coooer of Wosconsln, Join
ed in the criticism, but he had Just
had time to declare that Mr. Gard
ner's speech might De expected m tne
British parliament, when: a - point of
order cut short the discussion.
. Later Mr. - Stafford apologized for
what had been construed as a reflec-,
tinn on Mr. Gardner's Spanish War
service,- after Representative Moore of
Pennsylvania had produced tne omciaa
record showing that the Massachusetts
representative had been promoted for
bravery. Mr. Gardner had left the
house after speaking.
No democrats Joined in the argu
ment, but they divided their applause"
between Mr. Gardner and nis critics.
"Who Is here," asked Mtr. Stafford
when he took the floor,- "In whose
veins flows any Teutonic blood, but
that sympathizes with the Fatherland?
But mere sympathy for the Fatherland
does not conflict with the loyalty to
the Stars and Stripes. If Germany
or Austria-rHungary should . ', attempt
by any deliberate act to 'invade our
rights, I am sure those German-Americans
who in times past have shown
their loyalty would do so again. Not,
however, as some of the noble volun
teers from effeete New England In the
Spanish-American war did when they
enlisted for that little war, yes, that
disreputable little war against a lit
tle, and crumbling country; when aft
er they enlisted they had their moth
ers go and beg Governor Wolcott of
Massachusetts not to send them to the
front. . -. '
Mr. Longworth termed Mr. Gard
ner's address, "reckless and intemper
ate" and spoke of ' .the munitions
charge as a "wholly and absolutely
false imputation.' ,
"I regret that he made that speech,"
he said. "This is not the time to bring
up questions that will fan the' flame
of hatred in this country."
"Amen," shouted "Cyclone" Davis, of
Texas. . . .

Effective For All
The efficacy of 'newspaper advertising has been worked out in a
countless number of instances and the experience of the publicity
manager of Guaranty Trust company of New York Is similar in the
, essential details to that of others.
Telling of his chance to test -out the merits of circularizing and
advertising nmong merchants , whose money happened to remain idle
because of the Interruption of international trade he said: "One of
them came to our bank with $30,000 and asked us for a certificate of
deposit, as he thought the money might Just as well be earning some
thing while the international market was closed. This gave us an
, idea. .We mailed a clrculater letter to foreign traders, explaining the
advantage of depositing on these certificates in the war exigency,- with
the result that favorable answers began to come In. Then we placed
the same letter in the daily newspapers In the form of an advertise- .
ment and in a few days these advs brought in $58.000 in deposits."
It makes no difference whether it is banking or other lines of bus
. lness advertising brings desirable results and when seeking a medi
um in this vicinity there Is nothing which can furnish the service
equal to The Bulletin. 1 :. ; . . , . ' ., - -.

railroad and Including a letter written
bby Charles S. Mellen, former presi
dent of the New Haven, in which he
discussed the question of monopoly.
. Two and a Half Hour Charge. -'The
acquisition of the Boston and
Maine was one of the phases of the
case upon which Judge Hunt, in his
two hour and a half charge to the Jury,
today, laid special stress. He held
that the question was whether the New
Haven and the Boston and Maine were
in substantial competition.. He read to
the Jury- the repotr of the Massachu
setts commission of - commerce and
discussed the subject which held" that
there was no substantial competition
between the roads and said that it the
jurors should be convinced by other
eviaence in tne case that competition
existed, they .must necessarily find er
roneous the report of "an official com.
mission of the state of Massachusetts
charged with the duty of Inquiring
into tne railroad situation which then
confronted the commission."
Charge Favorable for Defense.
Judge Hunt's charge was regarded
Dy many in tne court room as favor
able for the defense. He held that thje
jurors must first satisfy themselves
that the alleged conspiracy to monoD
olize the commerce in New England
must have been continuous from the
date named in the indictment that of
the enactment' of the Sherman law.
1890 until the date the indictment was
found. Otherwise the government's
case tailed, ae said.
The defendants in that event. must
be acquitted, he said, "no matter how
guilty they might be thought to be of
other crimes not named in the indict
ment.' -
Also, ths case failed if the Jurors
found that the conspiracy ceased be
fore the three-year period covered by
the statute of limitations, the-court
stated. '
This point the court made in con
aldering the question of the alleged 11
legal agreement which the New Haven
made with the'Grand Trunk railway of
Canada within that period. One of the
alleged Illegal acts, the so-called trl
parte agreement, in which the New
Haven participated almost at .the be
ginning of the alleged conspiracy, the
court held not to be in violation of the
law.
The mere magnitude of the New
Haven, the jury was not to . consider.
