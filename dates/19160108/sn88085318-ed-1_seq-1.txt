There were one-fourth.as many
divorces as there were marriages
in Spokane last year. This would
seem to show that the famous old
institute of marriage is still pop
ular there by a three-fourths
vote. But in Seattle the divorces
were almost 50 per cent of the
marriages, showing that on the
west side they are harder to please.
The fourth annual newspaper
institute will be held at the State
University, Seattle, Jan. 13-15.
It is expected that 150 newspaper
men of the state will be present.
Visiting editors will be cared for
in fraternity houses near the
campus. The three-days' pro
gram covers all branches of the
newspaper and printing business,
and every facility of the univer
sity's department of journalism
will be at the command of those
who attend.
While it is generally maintained
that governmental expenditures
always increase and never de
crease, the Pish commissioner's
report shows that while the cost
was 88.8 cents per thousand to
tiatch and liberate salmon in 1912,
during the first year of the pres
ent administration, the cost was
reduced to 56 cents per thousand,
and, during the .second year
(1914), it was reduced to 43
cents per thousand or less than
half of what it was during the
last year of the preceding admin
istration.
Showing collections $41,000 in
excess of any previous biennium,
and which practically made the
Fisheries Department of the
state self-sustaining for the first
time; a hatch of salmon eggs of
207,807,749, which was far in ex
cess of any previous biennium's
output of the state salmon hatch
eries; a trout hatch and distribu
tion of $10,414,939, or about the
number heretofore hatched dur
ing any two year period; a reduc
tion of the hatching cost of more
than one-half the second year of
us incumbency of the office; and
recording the greatest output of
\ie fisheries in the history of the
tate, which occurred in 1 !)!•>,
and, of course, the greatest num
ber of fish taken, totaling 41,
--439,441, State Pish Commission
er L. 11. Darwin has just sub
mitted his first biennial report to
Governor Lister for the two year
period ending March 31, 1915.
On the editorial page of the
Washington (D. C.) Times ap
peared the following article on
Congressman C. C. Dill of this
district:
The day Congressman C. C.
Dill from Washington state rises
up in congress and makes his
maiden speech it's going to cost
him 25 cents. No, more than that
—25 cents plus compound interest
thereon for fourteen years.
The congressman, this session's
youngest, has owed that quarter
ever since he was sixteen. His
creditor is Mrs. Fanny Berry Bell,
Mt. Gilead, Ohio, and she has his
note to prove it. It reads:
Fredericktown, Ohio,
$0.25 March 10, 1901.
For value received I promise
to pay Fanny Berry Bell the sum
of 25 cents with compound in
terest at 6 per cent, when I sh.iil
have made my first speech in the
state legislature or the United
States Congress or shall have won
my first fight in either.
C. C. DILL.
That note may account for the
fact that Dill is a national law
maker at so early an age. Hfl
simply couldn't wait any longer
to get that debt off his mind.
The circumstances are these:
Dill lived on a rented farm near
Fredericktown, Ohio. Mrs. Bell
was the wife of the owner. On
one corner of the farm was the
Salem M. E. church and one day
On Earth as It is in Heaven.
Stranger gives three loud raps
mi tin- golden gate.
St. Peter—Who comes there?
Stranger—A Washingtonian.
St. Peter—Have you a pert
Stranger—Certainly.
St. Pt ter— Sign your name in
that book, and come right in.
a Ih>x social was announced for
Saturday night at the church.
Mrs. Bell asked young Dill if he
was going. Nope, didn't have the
necessary quarter he explained
cheerfully.
"I'll lend it to you," she said.
"Don't know when I can pay
it back," he demurred.
"Pay it back when you make
your first speech in congress,"
.she suggested. Dill being a ter
ribly earnest young man, had
made no secret of the fact that In;
was going to congress some day.
The farm lad accepted the mono/
and drew up the note.
He had a good time at the so
cial, untroubled by his new fi
nancial burden. Five or s x
years later he fell into the camp
of Tom Johnson and became one
of his secretaries during his gub
ernatorial campaign. After the
campaign Johnson asked lum
what he was going to do.
"I'm going to congress," sril
Dill.
"All right," said Johnson.
"You go out west and pick out
some good, growing town and
stay there till they send you.''
Dill went to Spokane. Ai,d
here he is.
