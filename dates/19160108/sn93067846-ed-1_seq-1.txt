WILSON BICH IN WASHINGTON
RETURNS TO MEET NEW CRISIS
WHICH: CONFRONTS NATION.
Will Take Personal Charge of Situa?
tion Caused by Sinking of Steamer
' Persia with American Consul on
Board?Officials Take Gloomy View
of New Complication.
I Washington, Jan. 3.?President Wil?
son started to Washington from Hot
[Springs. Va., tonight to take personal
! charge of the nation's foreign affairs
in the new crisis brought about by
the sinking of the British steamship
Persia with the loss of at least one
American life. The situation is re
garded in official circles as being the
most serious to confront this govern?
ment since the submarine operations
of the central powers began.
The president will probably lay the
facts thus far established before the
cabinet tomorrow. The destruction
of the Persia following upon the crisis
precipitated by the Ancona disaster
may result in the United States deter?
mining to settle Immediately all ques?
tions involved in the submarine war?
fare. The subject is expected to find
its way to the floor of the house and
senate tomorrow when congress re?
convenes after the holidays.
President Wilson decided to cut
short his honeymoon and return to
the capital at once after telephone
conferences with Secretary Lansing
and Mr. Tumulty, his private secre?
tary. It was found, however, that he
could not conveniently start until
8:45 tonight. He should arrive at 7
o'clock tomorrow morning.
The United States is reported to?
night act being prepared and deter?
mined to take any action that the facts
concerning the Persia may warrant.
Officials are trying to view the situa?
tion with, open minds, but It Is ap?
parent that they are disturbed by the
reports received from consular agents
at Alexandria and Cairo, Egypt
Jv ArfSry effort will be made to es
Imbllsh the truth of the report that the,
ilMgiift vas torpedoed without warn*

taking no steps until the complete de?
tails are known.
Officials find one source of gratifi?
cation in assurances given by Baron
Erich Zwiedlnek, charge of the Aus
tro-Hungarlan embassy, to Secretary
Lansing during a conference today at
the state department Baron Zwiedl?
nek is said to have expressed the be?
lief that the final explanation of the
latest incident would be satisfactory
He Is said to have assured the secre?
tary of his belief that if an Austrian
submarine commander violated the
principles of International law and the
rules of humanity his government
would take action which would fully
satisfy the United States. Baron
Zwiedlnek also sought Information for
the benefit of his government.
Secretary Lansing today instructed
Ambassador Pen field at Vienna to
make informal Inquiries which might
lead to the establishment of the
Identity of the isubmarlne which sank
the Persia or the receipt of Informa?
tion conceniing the circumstances of
the attack.
The secretary acted upon an Indi?
cation received from an undisclosed
source that no submarines of other
than Austrian nationality were known
to be operating near the point where
the Persia went down. No specific
Instructions were given to Ambassa?
dor Penfleld. Officials here are not
finally convinced that a submarine
was responsible for the sinking of the
Persia and still see a remote posl
billty that the vessel might have
struck a floating mine.
The report that the liner was car?
rying a 4.7-inch gun served to revive
consideration for the position taken by
the United States in regard to armed
merchantmen. In the early days of
the war It was announced that mer?
chant ships beloging to belligerents
might be allowed to enter and leave
American waters with guns of 6-inch
calibre or less mounted upon their
sterns. At that time cruisers of the
central powrers had not been swept
from the seas. Later Great Britain
and France, at the suggestion of the
United States agreed that their ships
coming Into American waters should
not be armed.
Since then all war craft of the Teu
tonic allies, with the exception of
submarines, have disappeared from
the high seas. Consequently it is con?
sidered in some quarters that mer?
chantmen mounting guns even of
?mailer 'calibre and astern might be
considered prepared for resisting a
hostile submarine.
Secretary Lansing and other officials
have considered this view with great
carefulness. The secretary said today
he was not prepared to announce the
GRIP ABROAD IN LAND.
EPIDEMIICS AT MANY PLACES
RESULT IN FATALITIES.
Economic Problem Also Scriou. With
Many Industries Suffering Person?
nel Shortage.
Washington, Jan. 3.?Influenza is
spreading over the United States from
coast to coast in the most serious epi?
demic ever known, taking a large toll
in lives and causing economic loss by
incapacitating workers in all walks
of life. Reports from public health
service officers, made public tonight
by Surgeon General Blue, show that
already the disease has created a
grave problem for many of the large
cities and is spreading to the rural
communities. New York, Chicago,
Philadelphia, San Francisco, Seattle,
Cleveland and Detroit reported the
disease widely prevalent. Cleveland
and Detroit each hare probably 100,
000 cases. Of the larger cities, Buf?
falo, Pittsburgh, Baltimore, San
Diego, Dallas and Mobile reported no
signs of an epidemic.
There is practically nothing the
federal government can do towards
aiding in suppressing the epidemic.
It must be dealt with by local au?
thorities and they in turn, it is ex?
plained, are almost helpless without
cooperation from the public. Surgeon
General Blue said tonight he had
called for reports from all parts of
the country with the hope that pub?
licity would tend to stimulate this co?
operation. {
WILLING TO ACCEPT. j
Marshall Would be Vice President
Again.
Washington, Jan. 3.?Petitions to
place Vice President Marshall's name
on the ticket for the vice presidential
nomination in the Indiana primary
will be filed by friends before January
7 and later will be filed in other
States. President Wilson's name will
be filed for renomination in Indiana
at the same time. The vice president's
friends here say he will make no ac?
tive campaign but that filing peti

Justice Lamar's Funeral.
Augusta, Ga,, Jan. 6.?With flags
in the city at half mast, the funeral
of Joseph R. Lamar, associate jus?
tice of the supreme court was held
today. It was attended by the jus?
tices from Washington and members
of Southern bars.
attitude of the United States on this
point In the future.
It is understood that he is waiting
an opportunity to discuss it with Presi?
dent Wilson.
The Italian ambassador called on
Mr. Lansing during the afternoon
seeking Information on the question.
He was referred to the position taken
by the United States at the beginning
of the war. j
During a later discussion of the
subject Secretary Lansing revealed
that Germany had abandoned some
time ago its contention that tho Lusi
tanla was an armed merchantman.
This claim was originally made in
justification of the sinking of that
ship, and affidavits were presented to
substantiate it. The affidavits were
proved to be false.
The Japanese ambassador, Viscount
Chinda, also called on the secretary.
His purpose was to obtain any details
which might have been received re?
garding the sinking of the Japanese
liner Yasaka.
The secretary had received no re?
ports of importance. He indicated
later that no action would be taken
by the United States in that case be?
cause the only pasenger aboard that
vessel supposedly of American birth
was born of American parents in
China and had never perfected Amer
;ican citizenship.
MAKES NO COMMENT.
President Declines to Talk of Return
to Washington.
Hot Springs, Va., Jan. 3.?Presi?
dent Wilson left here tonight at 8:45
o'clock for Washington after a series
of telephone conferences with the
capital regarding international affairs.
He goes to take personal charge of
the situation growing out of the
sinking of the British liner Persia.
The president declined to make any
comment further than to announce
his decision to return to Washington
at once, cutting short his honeymoon
by two days. A private car was at?
tached to the first through train.
Late in the afternoon Mr. Wilson
walked through the lounge of his
hotel to say good-bye to the employes
and thank them for court sales ex?
tended during his two weeks' stay.
HEARING IN UNION GASE.
SEASE LISTENS TO ARGUMENTS
ON INJUNCTION.
Takes Dispenary Matter Under Ad?
visement ? To Render Judgment
Soon.
Spartan burg, Jan. 4.?A hearing
was held before Judge Seaae at cham?
bers at Spartanburg today upon the
question of whether the temporary
injunction and rece^ershlp for tho
Union county dispe ^^should be
made permanent, y 0 Jease took
the matter under / ? Ment.
Tho city of Ur/^f A>ugh Its at?
torney, Macbeth 4 99 ? obtained a
I temporary Injun' ? .nd receiver last
week. Thomas my was appoint?
ed temporary P fir and the board
of control we 09 .porarlly restrained
from Interf^- ^' / any way with the
assets or lif j& of the Institution.
The city ,*ion was today repre?
sented by jet 1 Toung and John
K. Hambn.. ppeared as attorney for
the county and school Interests. The
dispensary board members, defendants
In the case, were present and were
represented by J. Gordon Hughes and
J. Frost Walker, Jr. Tho complaint
set up by themotlon for receiver being
appointed gave as a ground for such
action the argument that legally there
was no board, the property was with*
out technical protection and the in-?
terests of the people were therefore la
jeopardy. It was also alleged that the
profits for 1915 paid to the town of
Union were profits accruing before
that year. +It was argued that the]
debts of the institu tion having all been
paid, whatever assets were left were
the property of the town of Union, the
county of Union and the school fund.
The answer to the complaint read by
J. Gordon Hughes denied certain por?
tions of the complaint, alleging that
the board of control had not run a
closed corporation, that It had given
full and free information to the pub?
lic, and an accurate set of books had
been kept and aucited, that reports
had been hied with the proper officials
and posted every three montha It
was also stated thnt profits had been
absolutely untrue that no money hi
been paid during the year 1915, as
over $19,000 had been paid to each
of the three beneficiaries. It was fur?
ther stated that everything had been
paid out except the stock on hand and
$2,000, which had been reserved as an
emergency fund.
Mr. Hamblln, representing the
schools and county at large, stated
that he was present to look after these
Interests, did not ask for a receiver
and did not desire one, but If one
should be appointed requested that
IJ, T. Jeter, county supervisor, and
James H. Hope, superintendent of ed?
ucation, be made the receivers, they
having offered to serve free of
1 charge. They would not be allowed
to charge for such official work, as
they already hold county offices.
In the answer of Mr. Hughes there
were a number of exhibits In the na?
ture of affidavits from citizens of
Union testifying to the good charac?
ter and business ability of the mem?
bers of the board of controL These
were: R. P. Morgan, J. H. Barties, J.
H. Hope, D. C. Flynn, J. H. Spears and
W. D. Arthur, the last named being
the clerk of the city of Union.
Judge Sease stated that he would
take the matter under advisement at
once and render his decision in the
next day or two.
