CONTROVERSY
ABOUT SETTLED
Drawn Out Negotiations on
Sinking of Lusitania
Near Conclusion
DEMANDS OF U. S.
TO BE ACCEDED TO
Promise Will Be Given That
Privately Owned Ships
Will Not Be Sunk
Washington, D. C., Jan. 7.—
Count von Bernstorff, the German
ambassador, presented to Secre
tary Lansing today a proposal of
indemnity for Americans loit in
the Lusitania disaster, and there
by conclude that controversy. He
gave assurances that no German
submarines in the Mediterranean
would attack noncombatant ships
without warning or destroy them
without opportunity for noncom
batants to reach safety.
While offerjng to pay Indemnity
In the Lusitania case, Germany
makes the reservation that It Is
done without admission of wrong
doing. No official indication was
V" given as to the acceptability of the
proposal, but one set of American
officials took the view that it
would end |the controveray.
Washington, D. C., Jan. 7.—Propos
als which the German government
•will end the controversy over the
Lusitania disaster In a manner satis
factory to the United States were un
derstood to have been received here
today from Berlin. Count von Bern
storff had an appointment with Sec
retary Lansing this afternoon.
Germany Is believed to have agreed
to pay an indemnity for the Ameri
cans lost when the liner was torpe
doed at the same time basing a reser
vation of any wrongddlng on the con
tention that the destruction of the
vessel was an act of reprisal In retali
ation for the British blockade of Ger
many.
Germany Is also understood to be
ready to give assurances that her sub
marine commanders operating in the
Mediterranean will not torpedo with
out warning privately owned vessels
of any description, including liners,
freighters and tramp steamers. Ger
man assurances in regard to subma
rine warfare in the North sea include
only liners In passenger service.
Cabinet Hears Matter.
The submarine crisis, still of un
certain status because of lack of de
tails, was placed by President Wilson
before the cabinet today in its first
meeting since his return from Hot
Springs, Va. The senate foreign re
lations committee also met to con
sider the situation, but as Chairman
Stone was detained in conference
with the president, adjourned without
action.
Although more than a week has pas
sed since the steamship Persia was
sunk in the Mediterranean with the
loss of American life, officials were
today still uninformed as to whether
the vessel was torpedoed and, if so,
the nationality of.the submarine, and
other details Which determine the na
ture of the action the whfte house has
announced it will take. Develop
ments continued today to indicate
that the American government would
withhold action pending official ad
vices determining these points.
Overnight developments included"
the receipt of dispatches from Ambas
sador Penfield at Vienna asserting
that the Austrian government was
•without information concerning the
incident up to the night of January
4, and from Consul Garrels at Alex
andria, Egypt, stating that he had ob
tained affidavits from twenty-one sur
vivors and that all confirmed previous
statements that "no warning was
given and no vessel was seen."

BIG BUILDING BURNS.
Cincinnati, Ohio, Jan. 7.—The large
three story building and depot of the
Adams Express Co., at the northwest
corner of Front and Butler streets,
this city, was destroyed by fire early
today. The loss is estimated at $200,
000: Crossed electric wires caused the
fire.
LEGISLATURE CALLED.
Chicago, Jan. 7.—Gov. Dunne today
issued a call for a special session of
the general assembly to convene at
noon next Tuesday.

Washington, D. C., Jan. 7.—Presi
dent Wilson's address before the Pan
American Scientific congress last
night, in which he outlined the gov
ernment's plan for a Pan-American
alliance guaranteeing absolute politi
cal Independence and territorial integ
rity, was favorably commented on by
delegates today.
The president disclosed for the first
time the details of the proposal sub
mitted by Secretary of State Lansing
to South and Central American diplo
mats to be used as a basis for an
agreement between the republics of
the western hemisphere.
The United States proposes, the
president Baid, that all the American
nations shall agree to settle all pend
ing boundary disputes as soon as pos
sible by amicable process and to dis
pose of all disputes in the future by
arbitration. Futhermore, all countries
under the plan would agree that no
revolutionary expedition shall be out
fitted against or supplies for revolu
tionists shipped to neighboring coun
tries.
President WilBon told his rf&dience
at the Monroe doctrine always 'would
maintained by the United States
on its own authority, but that the doc
trine did not disclose what attitude
this country would assume towards its
neighbors to the south, and as a result
the other nations had been distrustful.
The announcement of the selection
of Lima, Peru, as the meeting place
of the next congress in 1921 was re
garded by the delegates as an evidence
of the desire for closer relations
among the American republics. The
selection was made by the executive
committee on the suggestion of the
delegation from Chile. For many
years a disagreement over boundaries
has kept Peru and Chile in a some
what strained relationship.
Sessions of the various sections of
the congress today were brief. The
congress will close tomorrow with a
joint meeting when resolutions and
suggestions evolved in sectional meet
ings will be taken up.
FORD PARTY NOW ON

Copenhagen, Jan. 7.—The Ford
party, 150 strong, left Copenhagen to
day for The Hague, on a special train,
each pledged to abide by military
rule.
Holland Is the last country in
Europe which the party will visit. It
is expected that delegates from a
large number of neutral countries
will gather at The Hague for a pro
tracted peace conference.

London, Jan. 7.—The sinking of a

The admiralty statement says that
the submarine, the name of which Is

The entire crew, numbering thirty

GREAT BATTLE ON.
Paris, Jan. 7.—Fighting on the Rus
sian frontier is fast growing in intens
ity and assuming great ferocity, says
the Petrograd correspondent of the
Havas agency in a dispatch filed Wed
nesday. Dispatches from Kiev de
clare that the noise of cannon can be
heard along a distance of thirty-six
miles and that windows in all the vil
lages in this region have been broken
by the concussions. The battleJs rag
ing with particular fury on the Tarn
opol-Trembowla front, where more
than 800,000 men with 3,500 cannon
are incessantly engaged. Long Aus
tro-German Red Cross trains are leav
ing this front dally for more remote
and thinly populated towns where hos
pitals have been organized.
Wounded Russians report that con
sequences of this battle already are
being shown In certain sectors by the
blowing in of first line German
trenches1 and the slow but irresistible
progress of Russian forces. The same
officers tell of enormous difficulties
the Russians have had to surmount
on this front, where entangelements
of barbed wire are often laid twenty
four deep and charged with powerful
electric currents supplied from sta
tions especially erected.
An immediate approach to these en
tanglements is impossible, the Russian
soldiers having invented the following
method of surmounting the difficulty.
Good marksmen fling ropes with
hooks at the ends over the barbed
wire, then pull until they have broken
one of the lines of wire and continue
this until the whole entangelement
Is removed!
British Papers Do Not Take Kindly

London, Jan. 1.-—The Manchester

which, though checkered by untoward
events, helped keep a united nation
concentrated on a single object from
the outbreak of the war to the pres

The Guardian demands positive evi
dence that compulsion is necessary,
saying at the same time that the na
tional cause is paramount over other
considerations. It says the figures of
the Derby recruiting campaign are not
making false statements in order to
obtain exemption certificates, and a
fine of $250 for failure to notify the
authorities should there be a change
in the circumstances upon which the
certificate was granted.
Prior to its passage in the house,
there was a bitter debate and the
resignation of three cabinet members,
all labor party leaders.
SERBS STILL UNBEATEN

S
MINISTER TO THIS COUNTRY
SAYS CONDITIONS AT HOME
*RE PAST BELIEF.
New York, Jan. 7.—In that portion
of Belgium which remains from Ger
man occupation and which appears
so small on the maps, there are 100,
000 regular residents and about as
many more refugees from the rest of
that countix All the refugees are de
pendent upon charity, says Aloys van
'de Vyvere, Belgian minister of finance,
who 1s In this country to inspect con
tracts given by Belgium. Before leav
ing today for Washington, the minis
ter said:
"In addition to these residents and
refugees, we have in our small bit of
unoccupied territory many Invalided
soldiers. Our Improvised hospitals are
overcrowded with civilians, for in such
a place, with the awful ruin from
burning and shooting, we have many
epidemics. There has been typhoid to
an alarming extent and will be more
when spring comes."
The Belgium minister said that yes
terday he received a cable dispatch
saying that the supply Of condensed
milk in Belgium is now exhausted.
"We do not easily what you Ameri
cans calls squeal, but this means dis
aster for the babies and nursing moth
ers," he said. "Six months ago the
commission for relief in Belgium sent
all the condensed milk it could spare.
We hgve grouped our children as much
as possible and sent them off toward
France to avoid danger from shells
and from the contamination of camp
life conditions which are virtually
everywhere In the little strip of our
own country that Is left to use.
"I hear that things grow worse also
in the rest of Belgium. Potatoes
which were our staple diet, have be
come scarce. Even the great quan
tities of grain sent regularly by the
commission for relief in Belgium are
becoming insufficient."
SERB HARDSHIPS MANY.
Paris Jan. 7.—Hardships encounter
ed by the Serbian army in itB flight
through the mountains of Albania are
described in a letter to the Temps
sent from Scutari on December 11.
"This is the sixth capital Serbia
has had during two months," says the
writer. "After Nish it was Kralievo,
then Raska, Mitrovitza, Prlsrend and
finally Scutari.
"As a tourist I am acquainted with
the Alps, the Carpathians and the
Pyrenees, but I have never seen such
goat paths for roads running along
the edges of terrible precipices and
the sides of peaks in the cloudp. The
officials of the Serbian government
rode little mountain ponies but often
they had to abandon their mounts and
go on foot. I have seen their horses
slip and fall into abysses. Sometimes
one hai. to go on all fours. Some, to
avoid vertigo, had to be guided with
closed eyes.
"Then there was snow which caus
ed fresh suffering. Roads were worn
through the snow a yard deep. Al
banian guerillas were taking pot shots
at us from behind rocks high up or
from opposite sides of the canyons.
"The army could not bring Its guns
and convoys through such country.
When we began to enter it we had
to destroy automobiles, wagons, ve
hicles and every sort of gun. Officers
and soldiers wept as they demolished
their guns, those pieces of steel which
they called their 'French friends," the
ordnance having been made at Creu
sot. The men had become attached to
them and many artillerymen served
the same 'gun four years. Some offi
cers refused to destroy their pieces,
saying they preferred to use their last
bit of strength in trying to save
them! and some of them succeeded
and actually have brought their guns
across.
"Altogether there have arrived by
various routes six thousand women
and children. The tragedy of the sit
uation is that the army has almost
nothing to eat. The soldiers had no
bread for four days but small quanti
ties of flour were kept for the women
and children."

PASSENGERS TELL
OF TERRIBLE TRIP
WEEKS SPENT IN MID-OCEAN
WITH GALE THREATENING
TO SWAMP VE8SEL.
New York, Jan. 7.—The 177 passen
gers who were forced to atffcndon the
sinking Greek steamship Thessalon
lkl at sea arrived here today on the
steamship Patris of the same line and
gave vivid descriptions of the hard
ships they suffered In the five weeks
the Thessalonild was battered by ter
rific galeq.
On Christmas day the supply of
meat* on the Thessaloniki was ex
hausted only a few gallons of water
were left and the ship's officers began
to portion out short rations.
The Thessaloniki first sprung a leak
when she encountered a hurricane
which raged for twelve hours Decem
ber 21. The boiler and engine rooms
were partly flooded and the steamer
sent out calls for assistance. After
the hurricane subsided the ship was
pumped out and proceeded on her voy
age.
Rough seas and gales were encoun
tered from December 22 to December
26, when the Thessaloniki ran into a
ninety mile hurricane which lasted
for twenty-four hours. Many of the
passengers and crew feared the
steamer' was sinking, as fresh leaks
ere opened and the boiler and en
gine rooms and coal bunkers rapidly
filled" with water.
Calls For Aid.
It was then that the Thessaloniki
sent out numerous "S. O. S." calls
which were heard by the Patris, Unit-*
ed States, Florizel and other steam
ers. The Florizel was the first to
reach the disabled vessel and offered
to take off the passengers and crew
and carry them to Bermuda. Capt.
Goulandis, who was making his first
voyage as a master, declined this of
fer. The Florizel stood by until the
Patris came In sight.
The Thessalonlkl's passengers were
transferred to the Patris with consid
erable difficulty and were forced to
leave all of their baggape and person
al belongings on the disabled vessel.
After the transfer the Patris shot a
line to the Thessaloniki and took her
In tow January 1. The wind increas
ed greatly during the night and early
the following morning the fowline
parted. That afternoon the Patris got
another line to the Thessaloniki, but
the cable parted again January 3 and
the Thessaloniki was driven rapidly
southeast before a cyclonic snow
storm.
Owing to the Thessalonlkl's engines
being stopped by the water In the
ship's hold she was only able to send
out Infrequent wireless calls, whicl*
covered a small area. The Patris took
up the search and 'was joined by the
Scandinavian steamer United S^tes,
which had turned out of her course
to give assistance.
Priest Stops Panic.
A Greek priest, Rallistratos Glavas,
of Cedar Rapids, la., calmed an incipi
ent panic among the steerage passen
gers of the Thessaloniki when they
learned the ship was leaking. The
priest went among mem and stayed
until they were transferred to the
Patris. He held religious services
much of the time.
This was reported by William Wil
liams, a naturalized citizen of the
United States, who was a passenger
returning from Greece.
