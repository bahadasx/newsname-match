the spirit of the factionist or the

DR. ARTHUR C. GRIBBLE, DENT
IST, I4 DEAD.
.EnBa me at Sulphur, La., Where
f-i Wennt Recently To Make
His nome.
Dr. Arthur C. Grabble, veteran
dentist, was not destined to remain
long away from New Orleans. After
living here fifty-eight years, and
practicing dentistry thirty-five years,
he changed his field' of activity two
months ago. Tuesday his body was
brought black, and Wednesday it will
be interred in Metairie cemetery.
Dr. Grfbble was a successful dent
iet with an excellent -clientele, and
was the inventor of an antiseptic
which attained considerable vogue.
No. idea of leaving the city entered
tlas mind, but last year he received
sehk a flattering opportunity to re
.era t4 Sulphur, La,, the model lit
11'tn near the rich mine, that he
decided to accept. He gave up the
home at 2218 Prytania, which was
almost a landmark, and his wife,
Who was Miss Beatrice Wailes, his
daughtear, Beatrice, aged sixteen,
and his son, Arthur, aged fourteen,
went to visit Mrs. Gribble's mother
in Memphis until he had established
himself in his new surroundings. He
found conditions at Sulphur even
better than he had thought, and the
family rejoiced in the prospect of
early reunion. Last Wednesday the
brother, J. B. Gribible, a well known
eoton man residing at 1516 Arabella
street, received a message that tlhe
a 1ist was very ill. He went to
pliur with a physician and nurses,
and fouhd the patient suffering with
pneumonia. Science and care made
a brave fight, but Dr. Grabible sank
fsit, and the end came Sunday morn
ing.
The remains are at Tharp, Bult
man & Sontheimer's funeral parlors,
pad will be taken to Trinity Church
at I o'clock Wednesday afternoon,

offilate at the funeral services. The
pall bearers will be W. H. Byrnes,
J. Each Spearing, J. J. McLoughlin,
'Charles H. Fonda, Arthur Hodgins
and Otto P. Briede.
Although of a very congenial dis
position, Dr. Oribble was essentially
a home man, and belonged to no
. elbs or fraternities. Oultslde of his
immediate family he is survived by
three brothers, J. B., of this eitfy,
Henry, of Ponchatoula, and Frank

CAPT. C. K. OLSEN
DIES AT HOME
IN NEWYORK.
Capt. Olsen spent some time ir
SCovington at his Claiborne home
with his wife and daughter, Mrs.
dHughes, and was much interested in
the future of vovli1gton. The Flush
ing Evening Telegram cohtains the
following notice of the death o
Capt. Olsen, w ch occurred Decem
ber 17, 1915. Covington will feel
the loss of Capta n Olsen jointly with
his home people of Flushing:
:Captain Charles K. Olsen, one of
the prominent civic workers of
Flushing, died at his home, Twelty
third street, near Santord avenue,
Pridayl night, with Bright's disease.
Ue enjoyed excellent health until
lat July, when hewas stricken with
the disease which caused his death.
Captain Olsen was born in Nor

Capt Nielson of Covington
Repays Debt of Giatitude
Capt. Morris Nielsen, who was in
terested here in the Ball Clay Co.,
and who is now promoting the Min
eral O11 Co., of this pjrlsh, is well
known here. We presume his mod
esty has prevented a recital of his
Western experiences, called to mind
by coming in contact with the son
of the Indian *hief who saved his
life. But we know enough of Capt.
Nielsen to feel that ingratitude forms
no part of his character, and the
son of the Indian chief is in luck tc
recall the incident, as is described
in the following clipping from the
Times-Picayune:
Twenty-two years ago Chief White
IEagle of the Crow Indians saved the
life of Morris Nielsen, Captain of
the Anti-Horse Thieves Association,
in Montana, finding the latter when
mortally wounded by rustlers,. and
carefully nursing him back to health
again. And that explains the rea
son for the great interest being tak
en in an Indian now at the Charity
Hospital by Morris Nielsen, a chem
iet of Covington, La.
The Indian in the hospital is Chief
White Eagle, son of the chief who
succored Captain Nielsen. He came
to New Orleans with the 101 Ranch
and was stranded here when the cir
eus disbanded. Through the strange
working of fate he came in .contact
with Mr. Nielsen, who made arrange
ments for his board ond lodging un
'til he could find means of making a
living. lMr. Nielsen was away from
New Orleans for several weeks and
returned here to find Chief White
Eagle in the hospital. ,But the chief
is much improved and when he
leaves the institution next week he
will go to Covington to work for the
man whose life was saved by his
father.
Captain Nielsen was in New Or
leans Tuesday night, spending the
evening at the Greenwall Cafe with
his old friend, Jap Brannig. There
a Times-Picayune reporter interview
ed him, but while finding him pleas
ant enough oi any other subject
found the task of making him talk
of his own doings in chasing horse
thieves to be equal to the task of
dynamiting steel.
In the early 90's, Nielsen was cap
tain for three years of, the Anti
Horse Thieves Association, an or
ganization of the Vigilantes, in Mon
tana. The + rganization became a
necessity when Juries and pudges be
gan turning horse thieves loose de
spite sound evidence. The associa
tion held its own court sad used the
limb of a tree for the carrying out
at Its orders.
One day Captain Nielsen. who was
Body of Murdered Man Fouad
In the Woods Near Talisheek
Amid the festivities of the Christ
mas holidays, when all the world is
supposed to be joined in the peace
ful occupation of gift-giving and
friendly gathering, a horrible crime
was being committed in the fiat
woods between Bush and 'alisheek.
The inhuman murderer responsible
for this deed could not have chosen
a place more remote from habitation
or liklihood of interription, and it ,
was by the merest chance that the
body was discovered by Luke Alli- I
son Tuesday afternoon.
IWhile there is no way of know
ing at Just what time the murder ,
we. committed, the coroner gave it
as his opinion that the body had lain
there at least ten days, and this
statement was strengthened by the
fact that the clothing worn by the
murdered man had been scorchel by
the fire that passed over the woods
the day before Christmas.
Sheriff. Brewster accompaniled Cor.
oner Heints to the place where the
body was lying Tuesday night. Long
stretches of water and mud had to
be waded through to reach it, and
a grewsome sight was presented in
the fliokering light of the lanterns.
The body was lying face downward
with the hands under it. It was
in the old style sailing vessels. He
was recognitsed as one of the emperts
at his day, and even in later years
he was more at home on the water
than on the land.
Of late years the Captain was a
contracting engineer, with offices at
fS50 West Twenty-ninth street, Man
hattan. He was active in that work
up to his final llness. The business
was closed out this week.
Captain Olsen was well known in
the Masonic woild, anti was a mem
ber of various other fraternities and r
organizations. He took great inter-i
est in civic work, and for two years
was president of the Upper Fluasing
Improvement Association. He was
succeeded a year ago by Jacob Elfert.
Previous to being elected president
of the Upper Flusaing Improvement
Association, Captain Olsen had been
chairman of the transit commlttee of
the association, and it was princi
pally through his eforts and en
ergies that the fight for the elimi
nation of the grade-crosaing at
Broadway and Twenty-second street
was won. He devoted much of his
time to this matter, and was well,
known by members of the PUblic
Service Conmmisson, and the Board
of Estimate because of the frequency
with whidh he appeared before them,
asking for improvements oet the1
Borough Queens and espeataly
for the UI pr Plushtag sseati.
It was known of Captain Olsen
that while he was .lways on the
alert for improvements for his home
town, he was-ust s activeMto pro
care improvements -for an7yt:
oft tbe borough. II his wa1
~m~Â·rsrr l I.- ~taa~ lrJ~~
better known by his first name,
"Captain Morris," with members of
the association, located the lair of
certain gentlemen who were not par
ticular as to whose horses they were
riding. The criminals fled at the ap
proash of the vigilantes.
The chase which resulted extended
aoross the state of South Dakota,
aross North Dakota and into Mon
tana. The rustlers made straight
for the Bad lands with the posse in
close pursuit. Suddenly Captain
Nielsen felt a sting in his shoulder.
He fell uneonscious from his saddle
and when he came to his senses sev
eral days later found himself in the
wigwam of old Chief White Eagle.
For two weeks he was tenderly nurs
ed by the chief and his tribe. His
parting words to the chief were,
"Some day I hope to repay you in
kind."
A few days later Captain Morris
Nielsen left the West and came to
Louisiana and took up the practice
of chemistry for Which he had been
educated.
His intimate friends here know of
his familiarity with Indians and put
him to the test one night when Chief
Red For was in the GCeenwail Cate.
There was discussion as to whether
lRed Fox was a full-!blooded Indian
or not and Nielsen was called on
for a decision. He walked by the
Indian and after surveying him de
clared he was a full blood but part
Sioux and part of some other race.
The chief proved to be half Sioux and
half Blackfoot. Chief Red Fox sur
veyed Mr. Nielsen and suddenly de
manddd if he was not "Captain Mor.
ris." He toldtf the time when he
saw Mr. Nielsen a score of years
ago.
A few days later Chief White
Eagle strolled into the Greewald
Cafe, and Nielsen happened to be
there again. 'He doubted the chief's
identity but the chief proved it.
He also knew of the incident in
which his father rescued Captain
'Morris and told him about it.
The Indian was bashful about his
personal affairs but Nielsen learned
he was in straitened circumstances.
He immediately made arrangements
ifor sleeping quarters and food for
the chief. When -he returned to the
city yesterday he discovered that his
friend had been in the Charity Hos
pital for two months from a bad
cough, -but was rapidly recovering.
He alled on the Indian an doffered
him the position in Covington in the
oil business.
And beginning next week Coving
ton, La., will be the future home of
the-Chief of the Crow Indians.
clothed in two blue cotton shirts and
two pairs of drawers. There were
no pantaloons and no shoes on the
feet. When the body was turned I
over the flesh was shown to be rot
tedfrom the face. There was a hole
in the forehead and another in the
side of the abdomen. Evidently
both were made by bullets.
It is surmised that the man was
shot by some one who took his
pantaloons, shoes and hat and what
ever of value he had on his person,
but thus far it cannot be ascertain
ed that any one is missing and no
one has been found who could identi
ty the body. Sheriff Brewster and
Coroner Heintz will carry the inves
tigation to its limit and something
may be learned later that will lead
to the detection of the murderer.
It is believed that all concerned were
strangers to this section.
Any one who can give any tnfor
mation leading to the identity of the
murdered man is requested to com
munleate with Sheriff Brewster. The
man was about 5 feet 10 inches tall,
sandy hair, probably 50 years of
age, wore an Odd Fellow's button.
Eye -glasses and pencil all that was
found in his pockets. Wore tan
socks and brown striped coat.
aol.ations, and also in the Flushing
Business Men's Association, of whica
he was a m mber.
The Captain and his family came
to Flushing to i've twelve years ago.
Captain Olsen was Democrat un
til the formation of the Progressive
par$y, which he became identified
with because he was a great admirer
of Theodore Roosevelt. He worked
diligently in the local wing of the
(Progressive party, and at one time
mW a county committeeman on the
Progressive ticket. It ryas through
his in fluence and hard work that
most of the delegates to the Progres
sire convention in Queens County
three years ago voted for the nomi
Ination of L. C. L. Smith for borough
president, and succeeded in securing
his nomination. Later, however, to
the astonishment of his politichl ac
qualatances, Captain Olsen came out
wfor Maurice Connoly, and took the
stump for him during the campaign.
The Captain was a member of the
13oard of Trustees of the Flushing
Hospital, and as long as his health
permaitted he was active in the work.
4 Captain Olsen had been married
thirty-one years, and his widow sur
vives. There"are also two daugh
aors, Mrs. Evelyn R. Hughes and
Miss lthel Olsen, both of Flushing.
-Oneo-grandchild also survives, Charles
Evan Hughes. Capt. Olsen's father
is still livin in Norway, aged 964
years. .

Sewer SYstem Gone A Gloaming
The proposed sewer system for Covington has gone "a gloaming."
It seems that a majority of the people of Covington don't want
bath tubs and sewers and sanitary closets if they have to be. paid
for. ldw i ', . .
Sewers need we not, the people say,
And if for them we have to pay
We'd rather do it grandpa's way,
Not cheat the buzzards of their prey.
No sanitary scheme appeals to us.
In fact -we feel inclined to cuss
Enlightened ways of doin 'things.
This world's just gettin' wuss and wuss.
But nevertheless it is said that if the taxe could be reduced to
about five mills the people wouldvote for a waterworks system, and
the Association of =Commerce, believing that it would be impossible
to carry the election for both waterworks and sewer system, re
solved to ask the council to withdraw this proposition and substi
tute one for waterworks only, being assured that a large majority
of the people would be in favor of it. A committee was appointed
to present a resolution to this effect to the council, and it was un
derstood that it would be voted favorably upon.
In the meantime the proposition pecame generally circulated,
and a caucus was held before the council meeting at the office of
the clerk of court, there being present Aldermen D. I. Addison, M.
P. Planche, Jasper' L. Nilson and E. J. Frederick, clerk of court.
At that caucus, we understand, it was decided that an election
should not be called immediately but should be postponed until En
gineer Kramer should outline a plan for waterworks only, and when
the council meeting was called to order and the resolution taken
up the fight was made to postpone it until after the primary elec
tion. The proceedings of that meeting will show the action taken.
The general opinion seems to prevail that if the proposition for
waterworks alone is put to an election it will carry. Mr. Kramer
has been written to come and advise upon the matter. In the
meantime Dr. Dowling was notified that everything was off and
that his scheduled talk to the people would not take place. .An in
spector from the State Board of Health has taken samples of the
sediment in the gutters in various parts of the town. They will be
analyzed and we wil learn Just what diseases we may have to con
tend with and how ecessary a sewer system is to protect us. It
was supposed that his would have great influence in deciding the
vote of citizens.

Hugh Linton is Killed in Wreck in
N. O., Caused by Snapping 6f Switch
Mr. and Mrs. Julian H. Smith
went to New Orleans Wednesday
morning, where they attended the
funeral of Mrs. Smith's brother,
Hugch Linton. Mfr. Linton was a
young man only 28 years of age,
and his sudden death was a great
shock to Mrs. Smith. During his
visit 'to Covington some time ago Mr.
Linton became known to quite a
number of Covingtonians to whom
his death will be sad news. ;Mr.
Linton was living with his parents
and the funeral took place from the
family residence. He was unmarri
ed.
The following account of the sad
accident is from the Daily States of
December 5:
The snapping of a frog in a switch
of the Public Belt Railroad at 5
o'clock Tuesday afternoon, which
caused a spreading of the rails, re
sulted in the death of Hugh Linton,
flagman, of 824 Lafayette avenue,
and severe injury of Tom Carey,
fireman, and Charles Holm, engineer.
A htorough investigation has been
started by Public Belt officals, head
ed by Supt. A. 8. Phelps. Supt.
Phelps declares there is absolutely
no evidence of any carelessness on
the part of employees.
Linton's body was crushed from
the chest down and death was in
stantaneous. The wheels of the
heavy engine passed over his body.
The flagman was riding on the front
ofat the first engine of the double
header. Another engine was -be
hind, and the two were pulling sev
enty-five cars of bananas from the
Thalia street wharf to Etuyvestant
Docks. Holm was the engineer of
the first engine, and Carey was his
direman.

The engines were to switch to an
other track at Market street. When
the switch was readhed, and Just as
the first engine was passing over it,
there was a snap, followed by a se
vere Jolt, and instead of switching
of to the other track, the engine
continued ahead. When the first
engine left the -track after the rails
spread, Linton was Jolted off, falling
beneath the wheels.

Tmrn sticks to Post.
"We did not know what to ma-ke
of it," said Engineer Holm, of the
first engine, "and Carey, the fire
inan, and I, Jumped."
Carey sustained severe contusions
of the chest, and it is feared that
he sustained internal injuries, whidch
may result seriously. Holm sustain
ed a sprain of the right ankle. An
other employe of the Public Belt,
who was riding in the engine cab,
jumped and was unhurt.
lLinton, the dead flagman, lived I
with his father and mother. The act
of Engineer Edward Grundy, of En
gine No. 14, which was behind the
engine at the throttle of which Holm
stood, perhaps saved the lives of
others. Grundy stuck to his post,
and even after the first engine had
left the rail and the severe jolt
had thrown Linton off, Srundy shut
off the throttle and applied the
brakes, checking the string of on
coming cars. His engine came -to
a stop before reaching the shattered
switch. Two of the cars behind the
second engine were derailed by the
concussion.
'Holm lives at 1209 Marigny street,
and is a man of family. Catrey lives
with his wife and family at 1021
Philip street. ,Both were old em
ployees of the Public -Belt.
The Captain had a winter honme at
