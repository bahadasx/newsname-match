her name. Hhe denies their ap

didn't mind the appellation, but
now 1 do—I mind it very much.
"Why, one of the critics who
interviewed me most recently

have the cruel cunning of Lucre
tia Borgia, till now the world's
wickedest woman, her mouth is
the mouth of the sinister, schein
ing Delilah, and her hands are
those of the blood-bathing Eliza
beth Bathory, who slaughtered
young girls that she might bathe
in then life bipod and so retain
her beauty.'
"Tell me, do I look as wicked
as all thatf Of course, this par
tioular critic may have beeu giv
ing the impression she formed of
me on the screen, but bow ie the
general public to know that
these are not my real attributes,
—those of my daily life! On the
screen 1 try to show how attrac

ful, so that one must ever be on
thelookout to recognize evil even
In disguise.
"Wbatismy reward! Because
I am a screen home wrecker and
in my work are only blasted
lives and stunted careers, 1 am
detested. People seem to forget
that I am only an actress, and
that an actress should never
show her reel self to her audi

' Why,—why do people do me

TWO GOLDEN DAYS.
There are two days of the
week upon which and about
which I never worry, two care
free days kept, sacredly free from
fear and appreliensiou
One of these is Yesterday.
Vestei day with all its cares aud
frets, with all its pains and
aches, all its fault.«, it* mistakes
and blunders, lias passed beyond
the reach of uiy recall I cannot
undo an act that 1 wrought. I
cannot unsay a word that 1 said
on Yesterday. All that it holds
ou life, of regret and sorrow, is
in tho hand of the Mighty Love
that can bring sweet water» out
of the bitterest desert—the love
that can make the wrong things
right, that o in turn weeping into
laughter, that can give beauty
for iahe*, the g irinaut for praise
for the spirit of heaviness, joy of
the m »ruing for the woe of night.
Sivefor the beautiful memo
ries that linger, »weet aud tender
like tbs perfume of roses, in the
heart of the day that is gone, I
have nothing to do yesterday.
And the other day I do not
worry about is Tomorrow. To.
moriow, with all its possible ad
veisities ( its burdens, its perils,
its large promises and poor per.
formanoe, its failures and mis
takes, is as far bayoud the reach
of my mastery as its dead sister
—yesterday. Its snn will rise in
roseate splendor, or beyond a
mask of weeping clouds. But
it will rise. Until then the same
love aud patience that held yes
terday, and holds tomorrow,
shines with tender promise into
the heart of today. I have no
possession in that unborn day of
grace. All else in the intinite
keeping of that Infinite Love
that hoids for me the treasore of
yesterday, the love that is higher
than the stats, wider than the
•ky, deeper tbau the seas.
There is left for myself, then,
but one day of the week—today.
Any man can tight the battles of
today: Any woman can carry
the butdens of just one day.—
