EAST YOUNGSTOWN, Ohio, Jan.

spiracy of ..iliers to blow up the
plant of the Republic Iron & Steel
company was overheard. The first
troops detrained were ordered immedi
ately to go on guard about the build
ings. Although the situation is tense,
there has been no further outbreak
today, the disturbance having quieted

Py T'nited Press.
EAST YOUNGSTOWN, Ohio, Jan.
8. Twenty-two hundred militiamen
who were ordered hero by Governor
Willis were still aboard trains in the
yards of the Youngstown Sheet &
Tube company this morning.
It is believed that they will not be
sent into the town unless the rioting
which cost one life and resulted in the
Injury of thirty-seven other persons
last night is resumed.
Mayor Cunningham estimated this
morning that damage to the amount
of a million dollars was done during
the five hours of rioting in which sev
eral thousand striking employes of the
Youngstown Sheet & Tube company
and the Republic Iron & Steel com
pany were involved.
The rioting started shortly after 6
o'clock last evening when J. M. Weltz,
head of the Sheet & Tube company's
police force, fired an alleged blank
cartridge into a crowd of two thou
sand strikers who were assembled to
Jeer employes who refused to quit
work.
The strikers were armed with
knives and revolvers and they rushed
the plant, firing the office and store
house. The business district of the
city was then invaded, the postoffice,
International bank building, fourteen
saloons and a number of residences
being destroyed.
Sheriff Umstead and his deputies
arrested fifty of the rioters and the
strikers finally desisted front making
further disturbance of their own voli
tion. The trouble originated a week ago
when laborers at the plant of the
Republic company struck, demanding
25 cents an hour instead of 194 cents.
The company offered to give them 22
cents, but the men refused, and were
joined later by employes of other
plants. The first clash occurred yes
terday morning when stones were
thrown and several shots fired In a
disturbance at the plant of the Sheet
K. Tube company, participated in by
strike sympathizers and workers.

SESSION OF
SOLONS TO
BE SHORT
Representative Jackson Says Usury, Elect
ion Law Changes and Road Legislat
ion Will Be Main Matters Har
mony is Predicted
Bert Jackson, principal of the Union
Hill school, was in Chickasha this
morning on business with the county
superintendent. He is a member of
the state legislature from Grady
county and will leave here a week
from today to be present at the first
day of the extra session of that body.
When questioned as to the probable
duration of the coming session, Mr.
Jackson replied that he thought the
members of both bodies would have
completed their work and be ready for
adjournment at the end of thirty days
from the date of assembling. He
Mated that in his opinion the teem
bt rs of the house and the senate were
in harmony with the governor and that
every individual member would work
hard and conscientiously in an earnest
endeavor to finish up the work called
for. "I do not believe," said Mr. Jack
son, "that a single member will be
fonnd in the Oklahoma legislature at
the extraordinary session who will
favor staying a day longer than neces
sary or who will vote for or advocate
measures which may be calculated to
fritter away the time of people or the
money of the taxpayers."
Mr. Jackson stated that the main
measure, the principal legislation
which would hold or demand the at
tention of the legislators will be the
usury laws. In this connection Mr.
Jackson stated that the house and
f enate. as bodies, he thought, would be
In accord with the governor in favor
ing the enactment of some measure
which would prove adequate to meet
the demands of the general public. "I
was opposed to the 'Glasco' measure
which claimed the attention of the leg
islative' bodies at the last regular ses
sion," said Mr. Jackson. "I opposed
this measure because of its drastic
ness and because it afforded no re
dress to the victim of usurious inter
est. The Glasgow bill was not a
measure which afforded relief to any
one. On the other hand it seemed
to me to be a sort of sandbag measure
calculated to strike at legitimate bank
ers as well as at those who make a
practice of charging usurious rates of
interest. I favor any law, and shall
vote for any measure which may be
Introduced which will afford relief to
the victim of usurious interest
charges, but I do not and will not
favor and vote for a bill which will
carry with it an attack upon legitimate
banking. Banking interests are like
any other business interests and while
restraining laws may be necessary,
sandbag laws will prove detrimental to
both the bank and the general public.'
Mr. Jackson stated that in addition
to the usury bills which would be in
troduced, the matter of amending the
election laws would also claim the at
tention of the members of, the legis
lature. Amendments to these laws are
now necessary, Mr. Jackson stated,
and these amendments will rcceive
pronjjpt attention following the Intro
duction of bills embodying them
Another measure which Mr. Jackson
stated would claim the attention of
the house and senate would be the
amendment of the present highway
laws. The state highway Taw at pres

CLEARS UP MYSTERY
OF HER MARRIAGE
No Love for Stage at Start But Worked
Hard and Early Won Prizes-Credits
Victor Hngo for Her
Inspiration
By United Press.
NEW YORK, Jan. 8. Anticipating
that possibij she might not "live to be
150," Sarah Bernhardt personallv gave
to the United Press and the Universal
Film company, those mysterious pages
in her book of life containing the gen
uine facts of her birth, marriage anu
career, which heretofore never have
been publicly talked of by the Divine
Sarah.
During the production in France of
"Jeanne Dore," in which Bernhardt
starred, the discouragement she ex
perienced because she could not walk
with her artificial leg and the physical
distress resulting from her becoming
stout through her enforced lack of ex
ercise, led the Divine Sarah to agree
to make this statement to the United
Press through John Tippett, European
producing manager in charge of the
film. The facts hers disclosed clear
up the mystery as to who her husband
was and why she married him.
The records of Bernhardt's birth
were destroyed in the burning of the
Commune. The alleged facta have
been published many times, some stal
ing that she was born in Havre, others
that she was born in Holland; but
Bernhardt said:
"I was born in Paris at 265 Rue St.
Honore, Oct. 23, 1844. My blood is a
mingling of French and Dutch-Jewish.
My real name is Rosine Bernard. I
was the eleventh of 14 children. Of
my father I knew but little. When r
was a baby he went to China; why 1
have no idea. My mother was by
birth a Dutch Jewess, by sympathy a
French woman and by habit a cosmo
politan. She traveled much.
"As much because there was no
home as because the French banish
infants ficra the household, I spent my
childhood with a foster-mother, first In
the Breton country near Quimperle
where I fell in the fireplace and was
badly burned then at Neullly. My
mother came seldom to see me, but
I loved her.
"When I was seven I was sent to
boarding school at Auteuil, where I
spent two comparatively happy years.
My mysterious father then ordered me
transferred to a convent.
"At Neuilly my Aunt Rosine cam
one day to see me. I insisted that I
wanted to go away with her at once.
She went away. I could see nothing
but the dark, black hole behind me,
and in despair I rushed out to my
aunt's carriage. After that I knew
nothing. 1 had fallen on the pave
ment and broken my arm in two
places and injured my knee cap. It
took me two years to recover."
"At the Aug'.iftlnian convent at
Grandchamp, Versailles. I was bap
tized and confirmed a Christian and
became extravagantly pious. I was
fractious and more than once expelled.
"When I left the convent I was ca
pricious, sensitive and religious, a
problem for my mother. I was
strongly in-lined to be a man. When
I was fifteen I was sent to the Con
servatoire. T had never heard of the
famous school. That same evening I
was taken to the Theater Francais.
I left, the theater weeping.
"In 1860 I began my studies at the
Conservatoire with no love for the ca
reer. Beauvallet said I would be a
great tragedienne; Regner maintained
I would be a comedienne while Provost
put them In agreement by declaring I
would be both.
"I was no beauty, was decidedly thin,
had kinky hair and a pale face. But
I worked hard, and when I left I had
won two second prizes, one for tragedy
in 1861, and one for comedy In 1862.
Almost immediately I received a call
to the Comedie Francalse and re
solved that If the stage was to be my
