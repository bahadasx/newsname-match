HOT AIR SERVED FRESH
City Health Department Tells
People to Sleep With Heads
Out of Window.
"Sleep with your heads out of the
window" Is the late.it advlco from the
City Health Department.
It assures fresh air and a fine tar
get for gentlemen In search of "beans"
to throw missiles at.
Notwithstanding the fact that pneu
monia has always been the most
dreaded enemy of the American In
dian because of the exposure to Fresh
Air for which he has been noted, the
Health Department believes an open
air' pralrlo life just tho thing neces
sary to ensure longlvlty to Chicago
ans. Although the Eskimos live In
homes with no windows, and with but
one low entrance through which they
havo to crawl on hands and knees to
get lu or out, tho department believes
that tho cskimo leads the model
life for Chlcngouns to copy. He ex
ists In this nbodo for nine months In
tho year and uses a knlfo to cut the
air which does not escape through tho
nolo cut in the roof for a chimney.
Three months In the year he lives In
a skin hut It ho has the skins.
We can readily Imagine tho danger
from empty bottles In the hands of
friends of Sunday-closed saloon keep
ers, that would threaten the devoted
head of Mayor Thompson If he per
sisted In hanging It out of tho window
nil night.
We also sympathize deeply with tho
Health Department over tho awful
work of civilization In placing toilet
rooms in houses instead of In tho
back yard, or the next block, as was
the case In tho good old FreBh Air
times of yore.
The Department believes Chicago
ans would bo hotter off It llko the
Eskimos they dressed In furs all
the year around. Furs arc cheaper In

Dr. John Dill Robertson Is a good

told a Tribune reporter who called to
ask about the effects of tho Fresh Air
Traction and "L" cars and tho popular
effect they produced, especially on tho
number ot death notices printed In
tho Tribune tho largest on record:
"It Is up to tho people ot Chicago,"
said Dr. John Dill Robertson, Health
Commissioner.
"If tho public chooses to regard as
an academic fad every common senso
utterance in favor of Fresh Air tho
public has itself and no one elso to
blame It it finds itself lu Its coffin.
"It I could take tho peoplo of Chi

entirely is to sleep with your head
out of the window,
"The pneumonia germ must have
its soil, Just aa the germ of wheat and
tho germ ot rye must have Its soil.
The soil in which the pneumonia
germ waxes and grows Is the soil of

"It isn't merely that our air Isn't
'fresh' air; It's dirty air, It's foul air.
There Is nothing to do but act. And
If you don't act you have no call to

drives around."

Perhaps, to be exact, Sullivan takes
tho Senator's generosity too serious
