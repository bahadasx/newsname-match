IX IHNfi WAR.
BBRUN, via Amsterdam, Jan. 8.
Maximilian Harden has been prohib
ited from speaking or writing for the
lemalnder of the war. The Weekly
Xuknft was suppressed for attacking
the government. Tne cause Is un
known outside of liermany. Harden
had previously criticized the fool
regulations, and other government
acts. Four years ago Harden giivn
the United Press an Interview pre
dicting that war between England
and Germany was inevitable unless
s complete change occurred In Her
man policies.
The Harden suppression Is one of
the most drastic acts of censorship
.since the war. He had lieen one of
the most rearVd publicists. He was
formerly an Intimate friend of Bis
marck. Ills chief fame was gained
b) charging unspeakable Immorality
In the kaiser's entourage He wns
acquitted of a libel charge.
