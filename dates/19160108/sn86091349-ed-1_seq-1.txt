cause of the tragic, death of two mtn
ers in No. 3 shaft of the Yuba Leas

unfortunate ones who sacrificed their
Jth'ea were, H. N. Craw, and Tom
Mathews, while their companion, J. J.
McKenna, escaped being thrown into
eternity by the narrowest margin.
The accident was a most peculiar
one and perhaps never in the history
of mining has there been anything to
compare with this particular incident
The men were coming off shift and
came up on the second skip through
the Inclined shaft.
Thev had arrived within a few feet
of the surface when the skip jumped"
the ice covered rails and in almost a
flash, the skip turned turtle, and
dumped its precious load into the
ablsst below. McKenna was the first
to go, but was fortunate in catching
himself about 40 feet below the col
lar of the shaft and sustained only
siigh bruisets.
Mathews rolled down the incline
for about 700 feet where his mang
led form lodged against some tim
bers and was later picked up by a
rescue party consisting of George
Karakas, R. R. Orr. Jack Strasser
and Jack Mathews, a brother of

fected by the low price of silver. '
The mine production cf copper in
1914 to about 67,480,000 pounds in
1915 an increase cf 10.6 per cent.
The total value of the output, on ac-
ociunt of the high average price in
1915 increased from 18,111,108 to
approximately $11,708,000.
The lead 1 production of eNvada
mines increased from 12,809,655
pounds in 1914 to about 14,809,653
pounds in 1915, an increase of over
15 per cent. This output, however,
is not as great as that of 1913, when
over 16,000,000 pounds were pro
duced. A large portion cf the output
came from Lincoln county, where the
Prince Consolidated was . reported

A great insrcase, nearly 62 per cent
was made in the mine output of zinc

Thursday afternoon and interment
took place in a local cemetery. The
obsequies were conducted by Judge
Horsey and the building was jammed
by friends who came to pay their;
last respects to the deceased, who
was a highly respected citizen. The;
floral offerings were many and beaut
iful. There were so many tlrcumstances,
so many conditions surrounding the
cause of this awful accident. that
the jury empanneled by Coroner Ben
Harris, was unable after hearing the
testimony of numerous witnesses, to
definitely fix the blame and brought
la the simple verdict to the effect
that the. tragedy was due to the ac
cidental overtiming of the fatal skip.

inspection of the mine and has giv

More than 3,000 saloons, a large
(number of breweries, wholesale liquor

read and it was evident from the
tone of the letter that the question
of rabbles la considered tt serious

President Hendrlc goes on to state
that he has taken up the matter of
the protection of the people of the
state against the outbreak with the'
United States senators at Washington
and earnestly solicits the Ico-opera-
