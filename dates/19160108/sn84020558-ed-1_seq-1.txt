YOUNGSTOWN, O., Jan. 8.
Four men were killed, 19 othdr
persons, including a woman,
shot, and fifteen city blocks de
stroyed by fire as a result of
r:ots growing out of the steel
mills strike here last night, fol
lowing a battle between a crowd
of strike sympathizers and armed
guards at the plant of the
Youngstown Sheet and Tube
Company.
Rioters stole 500 pounds of dy
namite and have dynamited sev
eral houses it is reported.
The bridge from East Youngs
town to Struthers was burned to
prevent rioters from entering the
town. Two companies of the
United States regulars from Co
lumbus are reported to have been
ordered to East Youngstown be
cause of the looting and burning
of the postoffice.
At three o'clock this morning
the fire was still raging, having
caused a loss estimated at from
$800,000 to $1,000,0C0. Troops of
the state national guard were
gathering outside the city but will
not be brounht in until daylight.
Pending their arrival armed citi
zens patrolled the strike zone.
Rioters who for hours had held
the city in a reign of terror, loot
ing stores and the postoffice and
setting fire to many buildings,
began to quit the streets after
romors of the arrival of tha troops
spread. Citizens, however, tear a
new outbreak at daylight, as it is
known that some of the rioters
have obtained a supply of dyna
mite. At 10 o'clock a wild mob was
surgirg through the streets and
battling with the fire companies
who were attempting to check the
flames that already had caused a
loss estimated at $300,000.
Several companies of the state
national guardsmen were being
rushed from nearby cities, the au
thorities having telegraphed Gov
ernor Willis that they were power
less to control the rioters.
The trouble started early in the
evening when the (lay shift at the
mills in East Youngstown a suburb,
quit work. A mob of more than 6,000
mtn and women formed at the en
trance of the plant and hooted and
jeered the men, many of whom were
said to be strike breakers. A number
of the workers were stoned and
btatt n.
The private police force of the mill
was lined up on a bridge across the
river leeding to the main works of
the plant. Some one in the crowd
threw a rock which struck one of the
mill guards

Communications teaching
United States Indicate
America and (ienna ny
Xear Agreement on Con
duct of Submarine War
Republican A. P. Leased Wire
WASHINGTON, Jan. 7. Two com
r.iutcations from Germany reached the
United States todey one containing
a proposal to pay an indemnity for the
Americans lost in the Lusitania dis
as'er, which may bring negotiations
on that subject to a conclusion, and
the other conveying assurances that
German submarine commanders oier
ating in the Mediterranean would not
torpedo non-combatant ships of any
character without warning them and
according safety to their passengers
and crew.
The communications were delivered
to Secretary Ionising by Count von
Hernstoi f I", the German ambassador.
The secretary immediately sent them
to President Wilson.
Official Washington tonight con
sidered that American and Germany
it last were near a final agreement
an the conduct of submarine warfare.
Officials made no attempt to con
teal their gratification at the attitude
Germany had apparently assumed, tl
was considered to be virtually in
harmony with the American viewpoint.
Tension regarding the entire sub
marine question seemed to have les
sened considerably. Austria in its
ret ly to the last Ancona note, having
. ssuicd the I nited States of its in
tentions to operate submarines with
uue regard for international law and
the principles of humanity. Turkey
aiiii Bulgaria, it is undrstood, next
will take steps to give such guar
antees. It is stated authoritatively
that Germany and Austria-Hungary
will use their influence to accompns.i
this end.
The Lusitania controversy except
for the. wording of the agreement to
be entered 'nto. is considered in Teu
tonic iucles here virtually ended.
Under the terms of the proposal
submitted for tiie approval or tl.
Fnitee. States. Germany, while offer
ing to pay an indemnity, makes the
reservation that no admission of
wrong doing ?s involved. It is con
tendeu that the Lusitania was sunk
a an act of reprisal lor the Pritish
blockade of Germany.
While Secretary Iansing is under
stood not to have indicated to Count
vonHc-rnstorff whether the proposal
w:.s satisfactory. Lumber of officials
in a position to be familiar with the
American attitude indicated that it
would be accepted.
The assurances regarding the con
duct of submarine warfare in the
Mediterranean obviously prompted by
the sinking of the British steamship
Pt rsia with a los of two American
li'cs, are much broader in their
-cope thai, the- promises made after
the Lusitania. disaster covering the
operations of submarines in the
North Sea and adjacent waters. The
iattr guaranteed enlv that "liners"
should Ik immune from attack with
out warning. The assurances regard
ing the Mediterranean operations, in
clude piivalelv owned ships of everc
character, freight as well as pessengcr
vessels, provided, of course,, they do not
attempt I" escape or offer resistance.
It was revealed today, too. that in
the reply to the last note regarding
the William I'. Frye. the Berlin for
eign office agreed with the American
iew that small boats c annot under
all conditions be considered a place
of safety for persons leaving
a ship about to be attacked.
The German government apparently
is not certain whether a Gorman sub
marine sank the Persia and promises
Cie I'nited States in todny's communi
cation that should it develop that such
was the case, the matter will tie in
esig.;tcl and submitted to prize court
proceedings, and that if the com
mander diso'ieved his orders he will
be punished and reparation made for
the dtnth of cr injuries to American
citizens.
Consideration of the German assur
ances and of the apparent attitude of
Austria-Hungary as reflected in dis
oatches from Ambassador Penfiel3 at
Vienna, led officials to believe that
the sinking oi the Persia might not
result in d it'ficult ies so grave as at
first were feared.

RUSSIANS iE
FIGHTING HARD
Republican A. P. Leased Wire
LONDON, Jan. 7. Some idea of the
determined natuie of the Russian blow
on the Bessarabia front is conveyed
by I'etrograd dispatches today which
stnte that the Russians for fifty hours
cone-el. t rated 4 'J guns on the Aus
trians' positions at Czernowitz as a
preparation for infantry attack. The
Russian communications do not yet
claim that Czernowitz has fallen, but
dispatches from German sources ad
mit the Teutonic position there is
critical.
It is not yet clear whether the Rus
sian operations in this theater herald
a big general offensive movement of
all the Russian armies fr.,m the Baltic
to the Rumanian bonier or merely a
diversion of unparalied magnitude and
fierceness, designed to weaken the
pressure of the contral powers in the
Balkans and incidentally on the Ualian
front. The fighting has been of the
most bittei- charaeter, according to
both the Austrian and Russian reports.
Few prisoners are being taken and the
infantry engagements are largely in
the nature of hand-to-hand encoun
ters. All of the Russian operations thus
far revealed are being pressed along
the railway lines, which simplify the
problems of the winter supply of food,
ammunition and fuel.
The situation along the other
fronts is comparatively quiet.
The loss of a British submarine by
a mischance of navigation off the
Dutch coast makes a total of eleven
British submarines lost .since the be
ginning of the w ar.
A majority of these-, however, have
been of the smaller t pe.
An echo of General Sir Ian Hamil
ton's review of the Dardanelles opera
lions is found in a report published to
day that General Sir Frederick Stop
ford, who was recalled on account of
his conduct in the Suvla bay opera
tions, has demanded an inquiry by the
war oflice into the whole circum
stances of the landing of troops in the
Dardanelles.

All of the defendants except William

verdict. They faced the possibility of
jail sentences of a year should the
case go against them.
Judge Hunt's charge was regarded
by many in the court as favorable for
the defense. He held that the jurors

alleged conspiracy to monopolize the;
commerce in New'Kngland must have
been continuous from the date named

made of the Sherman law. 1S:'0. until
the date the indictment was found.
Otherwise. the government's case

The defendants in that event must

guilty they might be thought to be
of other crimes not named in the in
dictment." Also the case failed if the jurors
found that the conspiracy ceased be

the statute of limitations, the court
stated.
