JUDGE TAKES SLUR OFF
CITY POOLROOMS
Calls Them Good Places for Boys if Properly Run
Blames Owners Who Allow Gambling and Cards
Boys Better Off in Poolrooms Than
on the Streets.
Judge Harry W. Fisher today cast
a new and humane angle on the pool
room argument He softened the
slur cast on poolrooms and claimed
that when properly run they were a
yfp good, interesting recreation place
for boys.
Edward Burns, 18, was arrested by
Officers Haynes and McGee in a
poorloom run by C. Kallas at 531 E.
36th st. The officers testified that
gambling and card playing were go
ing on in the poolroom.
That gave Judge Fisher his hunch.
"The boy is discharged," said the
Judge. "And I want axpjnplaint filed'
against the owner of the place for
permitting a minor in the poolroom."
This was done and Kallas, who
was in court as a witness, was fined
$50 and costs.
"The poolroom argument that has
been going on is all wrong," said
Judge Fisher. "Owners of these
places have brought on the bad name
themselves. When properly con
ducted poolrooms should furnish de
cent and interesting recreation for
boys.
"There is little recreation for boys
nowadays, anyway, and pool, when
played for pleasure, as it should be,
is a good sport. Owners should be
forced to live up to the requirements
