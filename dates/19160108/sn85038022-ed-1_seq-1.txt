At tho Library parlors Friday nftor
noon on Important meeting of tho Wo
man's Club and Humane Society was
hold Jointly.
In an Informal discussion on tho
school law of Now York nnd that part
especially relating to Now York City,
It developed that there is a strong
feeling that there should bo at least
ono .woman on every board of cduca
tlOIL
After the meeting was called to or
dcr Air. C. R Qclscl madq, an excel
lent talk to tho club on tho Mason
County Humnno Society's work. Ho
mado three important points, "humano
education," "big sister movement" and
"all societies should have a humane
side." Thcso points arc worthy of
consideration and Btudy by all lovers
of tho human family. He closed by
quoting Dr. Stlllman, president of the
American Humano Society on "Hu
mane Education:"
"I bclicvo that the most Important
single problem which confronts hu
manitarians at tho present tlmo Is tho
extension of humano education. It Is
needed among all classes of society,
from tho highest to tho lowest. It
should lind a place In tho scheme of
education adopted by ovcry common
wealth. Its principles should bo pro
pounded Intelligently and authorita
tively In ovcry public nnd privato
school in tho land. It should become
Ingrained In our mental make-up. We
should not bo educated savages, but
something n great deal bettor. Chil
dren need also to bo taught love of
country and the fundamentals neces
sary for economic existence; thoy need
instructions in conduct, In considera
tion for others, nnd In thoso finer
courses nnd arts which go to mako life
and character worth while. If hu
mane education were taught for ten
years, as it should be, In nil schools
of this country. It would not mako
Americans less patriotic but it would
mako them vnstly better citizens, with
deeply Ingrained respect for tho rights
of others, and a thorough conviction
of tho duty of Justice to tho helpless
and of a living practical righteousness
in person conduct. Lot nil our so
cjejles'ttfroughout this broad country
of ours, bend their energies to lay the
foundation for a national 'culture
while will mako'thc righting of cruelty
on tho streets and in the courts wholly
unnecessary, by bringing up our future
citizens so that thoy will possess as n
part of their Innor consciousness thnt
kindness of spirit which should be
shown to the helpless under all condi
tions. Then, and not until then, will
Justice and mercy rule tho earth."
He was followed by Humune officer
w. I. Nauman and others. Mr. Nau
man's 'remarks were poignant nnd to
tho point.
Doth tho club and society are do
ing a good work. If they can get th-j
financial backing they deserve, great
things along humano Hiicb will be done
inMaysvllle and Mason county.

find suits better than these,but the prices will be higher. You will not find suits as good as these at a
