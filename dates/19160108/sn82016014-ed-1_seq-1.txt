few hours 30.000 more men would

Three HcgimcntA Marshalled.
With three regiments of the Ohio
National guard, under Brigadier
General John C Speaks, patroltng the
smouldering ruins of the village of
Last iouncstnwn. or encamped in the
mills nearby, the civil and military
authorities here today expressed the
belief that for the present ft least an
end had r.een put to the wild scenes
of rioting and looting which marked
last niht and left the thriving little
city a mass of embers. One life is
known to have been lost, fully ten
blocks of the town, including the en
tire busiiHKH section, were burned and
several t housand peool- were driven
from t heii homes. The loss was
placed at no less than $1,000,000.
Two weeks ago laborers of the He
public Iron & Steel company struck
ror an increase or wages from 19
to 25 cents an hour. The Youngstown
Sheet & Tube company offered them
-2 . cents an hour immediately after
the United States Steel corporation
had announced its increase of ten per
cent for laborers This was rejected
by the workers and the strike has
since been in progress- Reports to
day are prevalent that strikebreakers
had been imported, which precipi
tated the trouble. The laborers are
mostly Austrians.
Physicians who were called to look
after the wounded placed the number
at ;00. although only fifteen had been
brought to hospitals here. While the
majority had been shot, there were
many wounds from knives, bearing
out the statement that when the riot
ers were finally driven from Wilson
avenue, the main street of the town,
they began finting among them

mills for an advance of 25 cents a day.
A crowd if men and women esti

Youngstown end of the bridge and
ieered the workmen as they crossed.
Suddenly a shot was fired and guards
taking this as a signal fired over the
heads of the crowd. The mob replied
and another volley came. A number
of persona including two women fell
to the street and the mob broke and
ran up the hillside. A block away it
reformed and set fire to the building
occupied by the Tube company's em
ployment bureau. A little later the
mob fi?d a small warehouse and then
turned their attention to private
property.

SUPREME COURT
JOLTS THE P. U. C.
Holds That Commission's Acts
Are Subject to Review.
Holds the Courts Cannot As
sume Rate Making Powers.
CITY OF TOPEKA WINS A CASE
Passes Judgment for Damages
on to a Property Owner.
Other Decisions Handed Down
by Highest Tribunal.
Kansas public utilities today won a
battle over the Bristow utilities com
mission when the supreme court held
that refusal of the commission to ap
prove new rate schedules is subject to
court review. The decision was in a
modification of an injunction by the
Shawnee county district court in a
suit brought by the Emporia Tele
phone company.
The Bristow commission ignored a
new telephone rate filed by the Em
poria company. It refused to receive
the new rate and the telephone com
pany then went into the courts to en
join interference in the adoption of the
rate. The court's decision today
denies to the courts the right to as
sume rate making powers, but com
pels the commission to file such rates
as a utility may schedule. Action of
the court affords relief to Kansas cor
porations when the Bristow commis
sion persists in its alleged policy of
refusing to act.
The utilities act provides that rates
in effect January 1, 1911, can be
changed only with the consent of the
commission. These rates must be
filed with the commission. The En
poria Telephone company scheduled a
rate of $1 a month for four party tele
phones. Later it asked for a $1.
rate and the commission refused to
hear the application or approve the
new rating.
An inj unction to prevent interfer
ence was secured Dy tne teiepnone
company when it took its troubles to
the district court. mat court, now
ever, held that the $1.25 rate was Just
and in this matter is said by the su
preme court to have assumed a rate
making power. it was neia to oe
within the province of the court to
hold the $1 rate unjust, discriminatory
or confiscatory, but in no way to seek
to dictate a new rate. In this point
the original order was modified.
Relief for the utilities was provided,
however, in the order which permits
tne ruing ot ucn raiea - me tuijjuia-
tons may deem Just. Should the com
mission later deny the rate, the cor
porations are entitled to court relief.
Individual Must Pay.
"Where a city has been held liable
for injuries sustained by a person law
fullyusing adefective sidewalk, the city
can recover from the abutting prop
erty owner whose active fault caused
that condition of the sidewalk." That
was the decision of the supreme court
today in affirming a suit for damages
brought by the city of Topeka against
the Central Sash & Door company.
Suit for damages was filed against
the .city of Topeka because of in
juries to a pedestrian while walking
on a sidewalk near the property of
the Central Sash & Door company.
Action was then begun by the city to
compel the sash and door company
to pay the dgment of631.15ajid

SEX ANJCCIDENT
"Therefore Women Should 'ot

Is Argument in Suffrage Bill in
Senate Today.
Washington, Jan- 8. The Susan B.
Anthony amendment providing for
equal suffrage was reported favorably
today to the senate by the suffrage
committee.
After pointing out that the govern
ment of the United States is one of the
delegated powers, the report says:
"Manhood suffrage has been from
time to time extended. Every en
largement of the franchise has been
a natural and logical development of
the principle of popular sovereignty.
We may assume that universal male
suffrage is an established factor in
our system of government.
"In our opinion, every argument
and every principle upon which uni
versal manhood suffrage rests de
mands the extension of its privileges
and responsibilities to women. They
are subject to the laws, are taxed for
the support of government and sub
ject with men to a common political
destiny. They comprise fifty per cent
of our population. They are citizens
in all other respects. Together with
the men they constitute the people.
In patriotism, intelligence, devotion to
welfare of the government and in
capacity for franchise, they are in no
wise inferior to men.
Half Disj'rancidscd.
"Neither logically nor justly, there
fore, can unlimited suffrage be recog
nized as an essential to our republican
fcrm of government and its existence
at the same time be limited to :ne
half of the people, arbitrarily segre
gated from the other half jy the lc
cidf nt o sex.
"Woman's activities, her participa
tion, sacrifices and her misfortunes in
the great conflict now raging over
three continents, have for all time
disposed of the contention that she
should not be armed with the ballot
because she cannot wield the sword.
She has taken man's place in all the
industrial pursuits of organized so
ciety." Senator Ransdell, Democrat, voted
for the report, but his name did not
appear on it when presented. . Sena

LET TURKS DO IT
Germany Will "ot Send Army
to Suez.
Ottoman With Million Men
Could Handle Situation.
BY CARL W. ACRERMAN.
Berlin, Jan. 8. Germany will send
no armies to the Suez canal, it is gen
erally believed here. Turkish forces,
officered to some extent by Germans
and supplied with munitions from Ber
lin will constitute the force that will
invade Egypt.
Discussion of the Egyptian cam
paign, the chief item of interest here
for several weeks, was revived today
by statements in the English press de
riding the possibility that Germany
could hold her lines elsewhere and
send troops to the Suez.
It was pointed out here that the
Turks now have an army of more than
a million men in the field. Within a
short time they will be well equipped.
It is understood that German offi
cers who have lived in Egypt and un
derstand the problems of Egyptian
campaigning, will be assigned to the
invading armies.
It is now possible for the Germans
to send supplies to Constantinople and
thence to Damascus within a short
time.
Within a few days a new time table
will go into effect, showing fast train,
running from Berlin to Constantino
ple in thirtv-nine hours.

closed yesterday by the Middlesex li
censing justices, in accordance with a
movement inaugurated some time ago
by the 'temperance leaders to restrict

is alluded to in Dickens's "Our Mu

sunken ship ayu for arbitration of
the disputed jrovisions of the Prussian-American
treaty.
The most important part of the text
relating to the sinking of ships car
rying contraband and the safety of
non-compatants follows:
"Until the decision of the perma
nent court of arbitration the German
naval forces will sink onlv mmli
An.erican vessels as are loaded wit
absolute contraband when the pre
conditions provided by the declaration
of London are present. In this, the
German government quite shares the
views of the American government
inai au possible care must be taken
for the security of the crew and pas
sengers of a vessel to be sunk. Con
Fequently, the persons found on board
ot a vessel may not be ordered into
lifeboats except when the general con
ditions; that Is to say, the weather, the
conditions of the sea and the neigh
borhood of the coasts afford annotate
certainty that the boats will reach the
nearest port. For the rest the Ger
man government begs to point out that
in cases where the German naval
forces have sunk neutral vessels for
carrying contraband, no loss of kf
has yet occurred."
Settle by Correspondence.
Germany declined, however, to have
the commissioners who will settle th
Frye damages meet in Washington be
cause it is pointed out that the Ger
man expert. Dr. Greve of Bremen, di
rector of the North German L.loyd,
would be exposed to danger of capture
during a voyage to America, "in con
sequence of the conduct of maritime
war by Kngland contrary to interna
tional law."
It is suggested that the German and
American exports might get in touch
by correspondence.
Germany also declines to assent at
this time to the nomination of an um
pire in the absence of a determina
tion of whether the experts would set
tle damages or principles. Germany
refuses to have an umpire consider
tho question of principles. In case
the United States Insists that the ex
ports meet in Washington and that
an umpire be named at once, Germany
suggests that the damages be ar
ranged by diplomatic negotiations.
For the arbitration of the Prussian
American treaty, Germany In the note
proposes a special court of five from
the permanent court at The Hague
of which each country shall choose
two and the four shall choose the
fifth, to meet at The Hague, June 15.
The special court would decide wheth
er, the Prussian-American treaty, "the
belligerent contracting party is pre
vented from sinking merchant vessels
of the neutral contracting party for
carrying contraband when such sink
ing is permissible, according to the
general principles of International
law. The United States has contended
that the German cruiser Prinz Eitel
Friedrlch has no right, under the
treaty to sink the Frye. The German
note proposes that both parties pre
sent copies of their argument to the
court on
March 1 and deposit their
counter cases and evidence on May 1.
