STRIKERS LOOT AND
BURN A LABOR CITY
Million Dollars' Loss, While Thou
sands Are Driven from
Their Homes
(llr Aaam-lnleil Prraa.)
YOUNGSTOWN, O., Jun. 8. Fearing a new outbreak of rioting
when a crowd of strike sympathizers assembled opposite the
YoungHtown Sheet Tuba company, Oeuerul Speaks ordered four
Cleveland militia companien to the scene. Operations at the mill
have been suspended. Three hundred office employes are ma-
rooned at the plant, where they spent the night for safety. One
life is known to be lost and many are injured. Ten blocks In Bant
YoungHtown, Including the entire bUBlness section, were burned.
Thousands were driven from their homes as a result of the rioting
and looting last night. The loss In estimated at a million dollars.
The strikers want an advance of 25 cents a day.
Answering the citizens' appeal from Struthers, Governor
Speaks sent two companies of militia. The message said that a
mob had formed, and a general fight took place on the streets.
Two hundred citizens of Struthers, opposite Eat Youngstown,
across the Mahoning river, are armed and mussed on the bridge to
repel the threatened invasion of strikers. Fifty pounds of dyna-
ntlte have been placed beneath the bridge, with an electrical con-
neotlon ready to blow it up the moment the mob started across.
CHRISTMAS CHEER BY
MERRIMENT AfjD HOSPITALITY
RULE OCCASION AMONG
THE FAITHFUL
Yesterday was the Christmas day,
according to the calendar of the
Greek church. This l;i a strong re
iiglous organization in Tonopah, there
being about 6U0 members, they being
Montenegrins, Dalmatians, Serbians,
Herzegovina, Bosnians, Russians,
Poles, as well as members of other
states which hold to these ancient
Christian rites aud beliefs.
The day was given over to jollity,
music and feasting, together with
reverential observation of the Hacred
occasion. In every home where the
Greek church is the one in which
worship is given there was the well
laden Christmas tree and the table
surfeited with the best of eatables
and drinkables, for this was the one
day of all the year from which dates
are computed.
All members of the faith then don
ned their best array, after the noon
time feast, and calls were given aud
received. With excellent orchestra
tion, a band of Christmas carolers
started to make the rounds at 2
o'clock yesterday afternoon and it
was 3 this morning before absolute
weariness compelled them to cease
their pleasant task, which was that
of serenading their neighbors and
brethren in the faith, singing songs
of the Christ. Rarely has the Christ
mas dny of the Greek church been
celebrated with such enthusiasm, hos
pitality and good cheer as It was in
Tonopah yesterday.
