AND ACTUALLY
The Real Exemplification of a Theory
Which Seldom Holds Good
in Practice.
But in the Case of Hon. Judge Alonzo
D. Burnes it Hits the Mark
Squarely.
It is not often that the Judge on a
bench In a strong judicial district so
ell satisfies the bar of his circuit
that with one accord Democrats, Re
publicans, Prohibitionists and Bull
Moosers who practice before him
unite in asking him to again stand
for election yet this is the case in
the Fifth Judicial districts presided
over by that distinguished Jurist,
Judge Alonzo D. Burnes, whose home
is Platte City and whose district is
made up of the counties of Andrew,
DeKalb, Clinton. Platte and Holt
among the best counties In the great
state of Missouri.

JUDGE ALONZO D. BURNES
And this means much to Judge
Burnes, for the action says that his
services on the bench have been so
satisfactory that all ot the lawyers
who practice before him want him to
still continue in that high position.
When one realizes that Just one-half
of the lawyers win and one-half lose
ln each case tried before him, the
honor just tendered is all the more
pleasing.
All Are Satisfied
As just previously stated, but one
half of the attorneys engaged in each
case can win the other half must
I0ge therefore the losers as well as
the winners, realizing his absolute
fairness and honesty of purpose and
the fact that he has the knowledge
of the law, want" him to still continue
the capacity he so ably Alls, nnd
sclose by this action thatthey are
ways ready to abide by his rulings.
The ball was opened at Oregon in
Holt county week before last when
Judge Burnes was given the surprise
of his life. He had just adjourned court
for tho term, but nau not leu tne
woolsack when Judge Samuel O'Fal
Ion, who by the way, Is a Republican
wheel horse of that county, arose and
asked that he defer the adjournment
until he could present a resolution,
judge Burnes, supposing that was n

matter pertaining to his court, readily
granted tho r-0,uesfr but was more
than taken back when Judge O'Fallon, j

fit, the snake couldn't get together.
Enoch said the last he saw of It the

the tail the rest, and had gone off in
different directions to hunt up the
missing joint. Enoch got almost home
with his Joint when an automobile
tooted down the road. This either
scared the joint or it was the coupling

THE WHITSELL CLUB
An Organization Perfected Which Has
for Its Object His Election
as Mayor
A SVhltsell club was organized
Thursday night by a large number of
the friends and admirers of Dr. J. C.
Whitsell, whom they will now actively
boom for the Democratic nomination
which of course means the election
as mayor of St. Joseph.
Dr. Whitsell is one of the best
known Democrats of this city and has
a fine personality, which will material
ly assist him in his race for the de
sired goal.

SCHOOL DAYS
I watch' em trudging off to school
Those merry al cheeked lads
With tingling finger., pocketed,
'Till hips bulge forth like pads.
Dilapidated books are strapped,
A dangling carelessly,
And beating time to rapid strides,
And whistling melody.
They're calling names to Hank, and BUI,
And shouting loud for Joe;
And dodging snowbills whilst they pat
A ball that's fit to throw.
Lordl I don't envy presidents,
Nor time-worn financiers
It's Just a merry hearted lad
I long to be, and tears
That start as I'm watching them
Are no begrudging sign,
But Just the sparkling mem'rles of
The joys that once were mine.

NEVER LOST HIS NERVE
Felix Blakely Was One of the Gam.
biers Wh. "Worked the River"
In An Early Day
There was burled in King Hill cem
etery In South St. Joseph a few days
before Christmas, Felix Blakely,
whose early history in this section
reads like a romance. There are yet
men living here who knew him well, I
and some who lost money to him
for he was a winner In the times of,
Abel, Btiffington, Argyle and others
here, and was one of the best-known
early day St. Joseph men. In the Atrhl
son Globe appears the following int r
estlng account of his sojourn in this
part of the Platte Purchase:
When Felix Blakely, age nearly 95
years, died Monday night, a most in
teresting character passed away. For
years he had spent the winters with
his daughter, .Mrs. G. W. Wells, at
her home easi if town, and his fatal
illness lasted but a week. It followed
a bad case of grip. The summer of
each year he spent with another
daughter, Mrs. F. C. Brown, at Leav
enworth. In the days when games of chance
were popular, Blakely was one of the
best-known gamblers on the Missouri
river,
He won large sums of money,
horses, etc., and like all others, also,
lost. Born in Jefferson county. Tenn.,

The elder Blakely took up a claim
near Platte City, and his son, Felix,
worked for him until he was 20 years
I of age. Then he went to Nodaway
county, Mo., and bought eighty acres pace as speaker of the national house
of land for $105, but sold this and took!. , , u- ... .u. '
up another claim. He was married in M a far neater honor than that of,
1841. Between that time and the Civil sovernor, and so could leadily se

which had grown to 700 acres, with a
large number ot slaves. Blakely was -eristic letters to Chairman-D. C,
one of the best judges of mules ana

of the war, he enlisted with the South

says :
