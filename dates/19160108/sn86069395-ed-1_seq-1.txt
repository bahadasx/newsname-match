(Continued on Fifth Pace)
Hopkinsville woke up yesterday
morning to find that the heaviest .sleet
fa)lj2rafiYers! yearS Ir.u fre vailed
during the night. Icicles wero ev
erywhere and many shad3 trees were
breaking down under the weight of
leer One tree in the yard of the E.
W." "Henderson place was uprooted
andjfelr across the pavement and into
thestreet. Some of the large trees
on Court Square were almost denud
cd'of limbs and from every direction
camcin news that trees were boing
ruined,.
But the mil damncps worn Inn tn
telephone, .telegraph and electric light
wires in every direction.
The Christian-Todd Telephone to.
waff almost put out of business over
its toll lines. Only tjirce small ex
changes, those at Crofton, Elkton and
Sharon Grove, could be called from
the load office. The main toll lines
to the South are down between here
and Pembroke and also between here
and Clarksville. On the Clarksville
pike one mile of poles are down just
out of town. Towards Fairview 25
or 30 are. down in one place. On the
Cox MiU road several high poles at
the overhead crossing fell and the
wires were all cut by a passing train
as they lay across the rails. On the
Cadiz road 15 or 20 poles are down
near town. The extent of the trouble
is not yet known. Manager Wood
ruff started out in a car locating the
trouble as fast as possible and before
noon had two gangs of "workmen out
of Hopkinsville and two out of Clarks
ville repairing as fast as possible,
getting up the toll lines first to get in
connection with other exchanges. AH
available men are at work out of all
local exchanges and traffic will be re
stored as quickly as possible, but it
will be several1 days before tho breaks
are all repaired as the workmen are
working under great difficulties and
discomforts. The damages will run
away up into the thousands.
The Kentucky Public Service Co.
was also hard hit. The Pembroke
lights went out from broken wires at
2 a. m. and the Clarksville lights fol
lowed at 2:30. Many primary lines
were broken in the city, but the plant
was not put out of commission. Three
lines on Virginia, 2 on Main, 3 on
Seventh I on Ninth, 1 on Jesup av
enue and one on First street snapped.
The losses-will amount to several
hundred dollars.
Telegraph lines of course suffered
heavy breakages, but business will
sillier no very serious interruptions.

SURPRISES
Baptist Board of Missions By
Quitting Without Any
Reasons.
SPECULATION AS TO CAUSE
Resignation Came Like
of Thunder From
Clear Sky.
a Clap
Louisville, Ky., Jan. 7. Keen sur
prise, accompanied by considerable
speculation as to the probable cause,
exists among local members of the
Baptist State Board of Missions as a
result of the tendered resignation of
the Rev. Dr. W. D. Powell, executive
head of the Board of Missions nine
years. In letters to the thirty-two
members of the board, located here
and out in the Stote, Dr. Powell ad
vanced no reasons for his decision to
sever connections with tun mission
work.
"The reason for the step I have
taken is personal between tho board
and myself," said Dr. Powell last
night Rumors of alleged friction be
tween the board and its secretory
were branded as false by Louisville
board members as well as by Dr.
Powell.
High tribute is paid to the ability of
Dr. Powell and the work he has done
for the Baptists of the Stote by board
members who said his resignation
came from a clear sky. Prior to re
ceipt of the secretory s letter, there
had been no intimation tliat Dr. Pow
ell even considered such a step, said
members of the board.
Unless a special meeting of the
board is called to consider the resig
nation of Dr. Powell, no action will
be token until the regular quarterly
meeting March 7. Dr. Powell said he
did not believe a special meeting
would be called. Members of the
board said a called meeting was prob
able and the concensus of opinion was
the resignation would not be accepted
without efforts to porsuade the secre
tary to change his decision.
In his letter to tho board members,
Dr. Powell announces ho has formed
the resolution to tondor his resignation
"after much thought and prayer,
Expressing regret at giving up tho
work, he says he "will slip out with
as little noise as possible." Dr. Pow
ell does not know wliat he will do in
the future, the letter said. After
pointing out the prosperous condition
under which tho board is operating,
tho letter states the secretory has
gathered together permanent funds
amounting to approximately $300,000,
His salary is $2,600 a year, according
to the letter.
Of the thirty-two mombora of th
board, clevm reside in Louisville.

London, Jan. 7. The ared- of Rus -sians
successes over the Austro-Gcr-man
forces in tha cast- continues to
widen. Although the situation around.
Czernowitz has not yet been cleared
up officially, it appears from advices
from Russian sources tliat the Aus
trians are hard pressed over a long
line of defense and arc throwing huge
reinforcements into tho district. The
Russians here are expected to strike
at Kblome-Stanisla-Haliez line, where
powerful defensive works have been
in preparation for some time by the
Austro-Germans.
Meanwhile the Russian positon 250
miles farther south on th&nudclle Styr
river has been greatly strengthened '
by. successful operations in the. region
of the great marshes where the Rus
sians are beginning to emerge from
the marshes, with prospects of being '
able to use the roads leading;eithor
nprthwest, west or southwest Theic
advance here has not been the result,
of an isolated battle, butof-a-series of
engagements lasting over a consider
able period. In the- capitals-of the.
entente allies the opinion is-expressed
that the Russian offensive has com-.
pletely upset the plans-of the central
powers for an invasion of Saloniki
and Egypt.
In connection with yesterday's an
nouncement of a defeat of a German
war vessel on Lake Tanganyika, in
East Central Africa, a half mile above
sea level, it is announced that the
British ships which accomplished the
surrender of the Germanvessel were
especially constructed in England, .
and transported to the heart of Africa.
Until the arrival of these vessels the
Germans dominated Tanganyika which '
is the center of a large and important
territory. The presence of vessels on
the lake will completely reverse tho
situation there. This is considered
here as most opportune in view o
the forthcoming campaign in East
Africa.
Telegrams from Athens say that
the number of Serbian refugees in.
Greek territory is now 40,000, ol
whom 6,000 are at Saloniki.
