note accepting the American conten
tions that the mere placing of non
combatants In lifeboats when a prlzo
Is to be destroyod Is not under all
conditions to bo considered assuring

Killing ship William 1. t'ryo, and be
tides making tho important conces
sion nsardliiB tho question of small
ixiats. takes up tho question of an In
demnity for the sunken ship nnd for
arbitrating tho disputed provisions of
the Prussian-American treaty.
The most important part of the text
relating to the sinking of ships car
rying contraband and tho safety of
non-combatants follows:
"I'lttil tho decision of the perma
nnii' court of arbitration, the German
naval forces will sink only such
Ameucan vessels as are loaded with
abioluto contraband, when the pre
conditions provided by the declaration
of London aro present. In this the
German Government quite shares tho
vjows of iho American Government
that nil possible care must bo taken
for the security of the crew and pas
sengers' of a vessel to be sunk.
"Consequently, the pertom
found on board of a vessel may
not be ordered into lifeboats ex
cept when the general conditions
that Is to say, the weather, the
condition of the sea ind the
noinhborhood of the coasts af
ford absolute certainty that the
boats will reach the nearest port.
For the rest the German Govern
ment begs to point out that In
cases where German naval forces
have sunk neutral vessels for car
ryinfi contraband, no loss of life
has yet occurred."
Germnny declined to hnve tno Com
missioners who will settle the l-'ryo
dnmuces meet Jn Washington becaUK,
it Is pointed out, that the German ex
port, Ur. Qrovo of Uremen, director
of the North German Lloyd, would be
exposed to danger of capture during
a voyage to America "in consoquenco
of the conduct of marltima war by
Kngland contrary to International
law," It Is suggested that the Gor
man nnd American experts might get
In touch by correspondence.
Germuuy also declines to assent at
this time to the nomination of an
umpire in the absence of a ilcicr.'ul
nation of whether tho experts toald

YORK, SATURDAY, JANUARY 8,
NEW HAVEN JURY
DEADLOCKED
GOES
OVER ASE ANEW
Reviews Particularly Evidence
Relating to Water Traffic
on Sound.
THE CHARGE IS REREAD.
One Report Says Jurymen
Stand Eleven to One for Ac
quittal of Big Directors.
The Jury' considering the consplruoy
charges against William Uockofeller
and ten btlier millionaire former
directors of; the New Haven lluilroad
returned to the Federal Uuilding.from
tho Hotol Knickerbocker, where (hoy
passed tho night, at 10 o'clock to-day.
They did not go to the courtroom,
and those who had hoped for a quick
verdict were disappointed. After un
ltour of discussion tho Jury sent to
tho clerk of the court for a letter
written by tho president of the New
Haven to William Rockefeller in 1901.
The letter asked Mr. Rockefeller to
use his Influence with Henry Vf. Flag
ler to cripple the Joy Steamboat Line,
which was a competitor of tho Now
Haven's water lines.
Mr. Rockefeller was told that tho
Flagler system was chartering Its
steamers to the Joy Linn for summer
iuo and it would be a groat aid la
killing off the Joy Lino competition It
Mr. Flagler would direct that no
morn of his steamers be chartered to
companies operating on Long Island
Sound,
In asking for the letter the foro-
man of the Jury reforrcd to It an a
letter written by Chorion S. Mellen
to Rockefeller. Tho clerk found tho
letter, hut It was written by John M.
Hall. He refused to send it to the
Jury under tho circumstances unless
ordered to do so by Judge Hunt, who
was, accordingly, summoned from
his office.
TJio Jury also asked for the testi
mony of Frauk M. Dunbaugh, Presi
dent of tho Joy Lino, and for a copy
of tho United States Supiemo Court
decision In the Northern Securities
case, which was In evidence.
Mr. Dumbaugh's direct testimony
was read to tho jury by Frank M
Swncker of tho Government's counsel
while tho cross-examination was read
by Attornoy John G. Mllburn. It ro
ferred to the "hard bargain" Mellen
drove with IJumbaugh In tho piirchuse
of the Joy Line.
Tho Jury nlso requested that the
Court again rend a pot Hon of the In
structions, With this dune the twclvo
men again retired at 2 o'rlork, hav
ing had two-thirds of the ease gone
over for them during the day.,.
All sorts of rumors as to how the
Jury stood wero heard, the most per
sistent being that it was 11 to 1 for
