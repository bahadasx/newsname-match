HUGE PENDEROSA LEMON
Mr. li illiam H trgr :.ler, of

city during the week and
while here he exhibited a Pen- I
derosa lemon, which was
raised on the Ned Boagni i
plantation, in Coulee Croche,
which place Mr. Hargroder i
manages. This lemon was the
largest of its kind exhibited
here, it tipping the scale to
two pounds.
From the number of large o
Penderosa lemons produced in i
St. Landry during the past I
year it is evident that this !
country is adapted to the cul- i
tivation of this excellent fruit;
there is no doubt, from expres
sions heard throughout the t
parish. that within the next 1
few years large groves of or- I
ange and lemon trees will be I
seen on all practically all mod- E
ern farms. I

DRAINAGE ENTHUSIASTS
MEET AT ANDREPONT
Taxpayers Propose to Have
Drainages District Created
In Plaisance Section
A drainage meeting. which
aroused the interest of the tax
payers. was held at the home
of Judge Adolphe Guillory, at
Andrepont on last Monday
evening at one o'clock. The
purpose of the meeting was
for draw~ng preliminary plans
for the organization of the
Bayou Grand Louis Drainage
District, which it is said will
take in some thirty thousand
acres of the most fertile lands
in St. Landry and Evangeline
parishes.
The meeting was called to
order by Dr. Ertemon Lafleur,
who proposed that J. F. Schell
should be appointed perma
nent chairman. Mr. Schell
thereupon made an eloquent
address to the large number of
interested taxpayers, who had
gathered for the purpose of
ascertaining what could be ob
tained for their section in the
way of proper drainage. He
pointed out that the Prairie
Ronde-Andrepont section of
St. Landry was probably the
most fertile in the state, being
favored with the climate as
well as splendid tillable lands.
He urged the creation of a
drainage district and the call
ing of a tax election.
"Several of the most promi
nent taxpayers of that portion
of St. Landry agreed with Mr.
Schell and all decided that
their best efforts would be put
forth for the success of the
proposed drainage district.
A committee composed of
J. F. Vidrine, Dr. E. T. Lafleur,
Emare Dupre, Armand Sou
vet and E. T, Dupre was ap
pointed to name three addi
tional members from Evange
line parish to this committee
and to draw up the lines of the
proposed district
Mr. Schell will act as ex
officio chairman of this com
mittee and as the members of
this committee are enthusias

out the various streams in
this proposed drainage dis
trict, it is expected that it will
not be long before the police
jury will be called jpon to cre
ate the district and appoint
commissioners.
The committee appointed
at the Monday meeting was
conveyed to Crowley on
Thursday for the purpose of
investigating the various
parents, to give YOU an education under
more adverse conditions.
WILL YOU FORGET THEIR EFFORTS AND
SACRIFICES BY NOW "QUITTING" IN YOUR OWN?

This building represents the pride and

years back.

Finally, the amount asked is small and

same time to interview farm
ers residing in those drainage
districts. Every member who
was fortunate to visit Acadia
on Thursday returned full of
enthusiasm over the proposi
tion of draining their lands in
a mbnilar manner.
The best posted men in the
Andrepont-Prairie Ronde sec
tion predict that the tax will
be voted with very little oppo
sition, whenever properly pre
sented to the taxpayers.
BOARD MAY RE-ENACT
BUTCHER ORDINANCE
Mayor to Recommend Changes
That Other Batchers
May Come In
Mayor Loeb has under con
sideration a recommendation
that he will submit to. the
board of aldermen, whereby
the ordinance- relative to
licensing butchers will be re
vised and reenacted In such a
manner as _ will rinduce the
butchers operating outside the
city limits to come into the
city -and place all on equal
footing, so tha "one will not
have advantage 'over the other
in the matter of expense.
The license assessed agains
those butchers operating out
side the city market should be
so arranged, the mayor thinks,
as to place all in the same posi.
tion, with equal justice to
each and everyone in .th
same business, and -at the
same time increasing the city's
revenue by having more of
them in the city and so that the
people will be the beneficla
rfes.
It is understood that the
butchers on the outside will
gladly come into the city, f i
the ordinance is so arranged as
to place them on the same.
footing as those now in,. thei
city.
It is thought that this is a
very proper move and one that
will prove advantageous to
everybody.
