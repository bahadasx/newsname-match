Editor Smitherman Speaker of the Day
Twenty Acres North of Lincoln Park
Addition to Be Sold to Colored
Another one of the many rotten
denls imlled off through the County
Courts or Oklahoma ngalnBt the hel
less Negro minors of this stale by
their wli le guardians was brought to
light In Hie district court of Creok
County Tuesday when suit wns filed
by Attorney John I). Wallieley of this
clly for little 11 years old W. (V Finn
ngnn of this city to recover the child's
nllntment comprising ICO acres of val
uable oil land In Creek County, which
was sold by the guardian, A. I., l'vans
of Wagoner, with the knowledge niid
consent of the County Judge of that
county.
Kvans, It appears, petitioned tlio
court for an order of sale of his llttlo
Negro ward's land on the ground that
the child needed the money to pay for
Its education, and the court pranlcd
the petition and Issued nn order of
sale, after aids confirming tlio snlo
of the chilli's land for the meager con
slderaton of 1700 00 Think of n six
enr old child needing money for an
education. Fifty cents would have
hi ( n the money needed to start the
child to school. Hut the worst part
or the story Is the alleged fact Hint
the child got practically none of the
money from the sale of tho lnnd. tlio
lawyer fee. guardian's feo nnil court
costs consuming Inmost tho cntlro
amount.
lawyer Wnkeley Is attacking the
entire transaction, as nn outrageous
fraud and Is asking that the sale be
set aside and the land returned to Us
rightful owner. Ho also contends thnt
under the Creek Agreement no per
son who Is not a member of tho Creek
tribe can legally serve as guardian for
any Creek child, and thnt tlio state
can rot pass any law In conflict there
with. The lawyers on the other side of
fered a demurer which was overruled
by the court, and the ensn will now
come up for hearing In March or Ap
ril The case Is one of much Interest to
the Colored peoplo of Oklahoma be
cauie they have been the greater suf
ferers because of this notorious sys
tem or graft. Hundreds and hundreds
of siieh suits will be filed It a fnor
able decision Is given In this case.
Tim cunrillanshln craft In Oklahoma
has made more paupers In the Inst six
years among the Colored people of
this state than nny other agency.
The County Courts which wcro es
tablished to protect tho Interests of
holploss minors have been perverted
and converted Into nn agency for the
perpotrntlon of fraud and graft agnlnst
those minors.
White men linvo been made guard
Inns of Negro children who they had
noor seen and through tho County
courts sell tholr lnnd without over see
ing them. White guardians havo been
known to sell land for his helpless
Negro wnrd for sums which tho In
come from tho land would net them
in two or threo years tlmo. And nil
through tho county courts.
Another bad feature about this In
famous graft system Is tho fact that
some low Irresponsible shiftless No
groes will make themselves tools for
tho white man In this knavery work
for a few blood tntnieu uouars j
groes hnvo been known to assist In
rubbing his own peoplo for unscrupu
lous whlto mon.
Thero nro also parents of Colored
children who allow themselves to be
como victimized by theso whlto graft
ers and will KO Into court and ask that
they bo appointed guardians of their
children. And oven somo of our law
yers for obvious reasons hae sanc
tioned tho nppolntment of white guar
dians over tholr clients. Hut fortun
