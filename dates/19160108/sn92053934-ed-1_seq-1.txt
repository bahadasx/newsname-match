Now Enforcing Law.
Younsrstown, Jan. 8. General
Speaks lias received an appeal
from citizens of Struthers to seud
help at once to that village for
protection from rioting there. The
message stilled that a mob has
formed and is engaged in a pen
eral tight in the streets, men shoot
ing and beating up eaeh other.
General Speaks at once sent two
companies of militia to Slruthers
In automobiles.
Later reports said the situation
at Struthers was under control but
troops will be kept there.
A canvass of morgues and hos
pitals today gave a list of one dead
and 23 injured as the result of last
night's steel strike rioting in East
Youngstown.
The dead man Is unidentified.

while looting a store.
Youngstown, O., Jan. S. With three
regiments of the Ohio tlational guard,
under command of Brigadier General
John C. Speaks, patrolling the smould- j
ering ruins of the village of East
Youngstown, or encamped in, the steel
mills nearby, the civic and military
authorities here today expressed the
belief that for the present at least an
end had been put to the scenes of riot-j
ing and looting which marked lastj
night and left the thriving little city
a mass of embers. One life is known
to have been lost, fully 10 blocks of
the town, including the entire business j
section, were burned and several thou- j
sand people were driven from their i
homes. The loss was placed at $1,-
000,0 00. ' i
Physicians who were called to Iook
after the wounded placed the number I
at 23, although only 15 had been j
brought to hospitals here. While the j
majority had been shot, there were
many wounds from knives, bearing out
the statement that when the rioters
were finally driven from Wilson ave
nue, the main street of the town, they
began fighting among themselves.
Saloons Are Burned.
There was no liquor question to sA-.
tie for East Youngstown, for of the
20 saloons ail but two had been burn
ed and they had been looted. The
trouble began late yesterday when the
day shift at the plant of the Youngs-
town Sheet and Tube company quit I
for the day. The plant is located on
the flats of the .Mahoning river, sev-
eral hundred feet from the hillside on j
which is built East Youngstown, where
most of the workmen live. The mills j
are reached from the town by a high j
bridge, spanning the railroad yards,
which have been carefully guarded by
private watchmen since the laborers at
the plant several days ago Joined the
laborers of the Republic Iron and Steel
company and other mills for an ad
vance of 25 cents a day.
Steel Workers Jeered.
A crowd of men estimated at 200
had gathered at the East Youngstown
nd of the bridge and jeered the work
Hen as they crossed. Suddenly a shot
ag fired and guards, taking this as a
signal, fired over the heads of the
crowd. The mob replied and another
volley came. A number of persons,
Including two women, feirto the street,
ad the mob broke and ran up the
hillside. A block away they re-formed
and almost immediately set fire to the
building occupied by the tube com
pany's employment bureau. A little
later they fired a small warehouse and
then turned their attention to private
Property.
A saioon stood on the corner and a
rush was made for the door. In a min
ute a shouting crowd filled the little
foom and helped themselves to what
they saw. When the looting was com
plete the match was applied and the
mob went wild. Kauffman's clothing
store nearby was next entered and the
stock passed out to the constantly
growing crowd in the street by those
inside. Clerks fled for their lives and
hen the looting was finished the place
as fired.
Liquor Flows Like Water.
By this time the mob was in a frenzy.

ILLINOIS MAN IS
CAUGHT BY POSSE
IN SHOOTING FRAY
Penns Grove, N. J., Jan. 8. Frank
Matson of Galesburg, 111., John Mayo,
St. Paul, and Charles Collins, members
of a gang of six or seven men who were
surprised while robbing the postoffice
here early today are in a hospital with
bullet wounds and two others are in
jail after an early morning fight with
a posse. Matson was shot in the arm
and face, Mayo in the arm and Col
lins in the hand.
On pay day at the powder plant two
weeks ago an attempt was made to rob
the postoffice, and as yesterday was
again pay day another visit from the
robbers was anticipated. A dozen citi
zens, four policemen and four post
office inspectors, fully armed, were on
guard at the postoffice early this morn
ing when the robbers approached the
little building from different direc
tions, picked the front door lock and
entered. One man remained outside as
lookout. Soon afterwards the posse
closed in. The lookout opened fire and
his companions appeared at doors and
windows and started shooting, the
posse returning the fire vigorously.
The robbers retreated under contin
uous fire, leaving the three wounded
men in the hands of the posse.
WILL WITHSTAND
TORPEDO ATTACK
i
Washington, Jan. 8. Future Ameri
can battleships will be able to survive
the explosion of a Lingle torpedo
against- their hulls, regardless ol
where they are struck, in the opinion
of navy experts. Experiments which
have been in progress for more than a
year, it was learned today, have dem
onstrated that two or more torpedoes
must find their mark before ships sub
divided and protected as new American
craft can be sent to the bottom.
The two superdreadnoughts and two
battle cruisers congress has been
asked to authorize this year will be de
signed on this plan.
SOCIALIST STIRS
PARTY'S WRATH
Schenectady, N. Y., Jan. 8. Charg
ed with failure to consult members of
the socialist party in the matter of, his
appointments, Mayor George R. Lunn,
the only socialist mayor or any city oi
considerable size in the United States,
faces being read out of the socialist
party unless he can explain his actions
to the satisfaction of its members.
The mayor will be given a hearing
before socialists here Tuesday. If
harmony is not restored at this meet
ing another hearing will be held in
New Y'ork before the full executive
membership of the state socialist or
ganization. The mayor's failure to give all the
positions under his appointment to so
cialists and particularly the fact that
he appointed outsiders to city offices
was the cause of complaint by his
oarty associates.
Man is Held
For Death of
Young Bride
Chicago, Jan. 8. Anthony Palombo,
whose 17-year-old bride died under
puzzling circumstances, will be held
by the police pending a complete in
vestigation into the cause of her death,
The theory of the police that Mrs.
Palombo died from drinking poisoned
coffee has ben substantiated, it was
announced today, by the chemical j
analysis of her stomach's contents and
the grounds remaining in thei coffee
pot. Both showed the presence of
large quantises of poison.
Mrs. Palombo's stepfather, Joseph
Rineila, who drank some of the cof
fee, is reported to be out of danger.
ENGLAND CRISIS
HOLDS INTEREST
Berlin, Jan. 8, (via London, 10:15 a.
m.) The German newspapers display
much interest in the conscription
crisis in England but venture no pre
diction regarding its outcome.
The Morgen Post says the Asquith
cabinet emerges from the struggle
greatly weakened.
The socialist organ Vorwaerts thinks
a struggle is ahead, but if the war
lasts sober calculation will have to
reckon with the fact that the present
active resistance will be overcome.
The Post warns German leaders
against building great hopes on Eng
land's international conflict. It points
out that crises have a habit of adjust
ing themselves.
SERVANTPROBLEM
BECOMING ACUTE
New Y'ork, Jan. 8. The war has
caused a shortage here in the supply
of servants. No immigrant girls are
arriving from Germany or France, says
Miss Edith L. Jardine, secretary of the
International Institute for young
women. Housewives who in other
days had only to summon servants
from emplorment agencies, report
that "green girls," as the emigrants
who pass through Ellis Island are
known, have vanished. " Managers of
hotels and apartment houses say the
problem of obtaining servants is be
coming acute.
MINISTER WAS ON
SHIP THAT SUNK
Washington, Jan. 8. Confirmation
of reports that the Rev. Homer R. Sal
isbury of this city, an American citi
zen, was a passenger on the steamer
Persia, sunk in the Mediterranean, was
received today by the state department
from Consul General Gaulin at Mar
seilles, France. Mr. Salisbury arrived
at Marseiless on the boat train from
Boulougne and took passage on the
Persia ,the dispatch said. His name
does not appear among the survivors.
TRAIN OF PEACE
PARTY ENDS TRIP
ACROSSGERMANY
London, Jan. 8, 3:27 p. m. The
Ford peace party has arrived at
The Hague, says a Keutcr dis
patch from the Netherlands capi
tal, and was welcomed on its ar-
rival there by a reception com
mittee headed by Jonkher K. No
ble, member of the second cham
ber, who in a brief speech in which
friendly sentiment toward Amer
ica was expressed, hoped that the
party would achieve its expecta
tions. Even if it did not, how
ever, added fhe speaker, its inten
tions were laudable.
Oldenzael, Holland, Jan. 8, (via Lon
don, 10:10 a. m.) The special train
sarrying the members of the Ford
peace party from Copenhagen to The
Hague arrived at the Dutch frontier
today after an 11-hour trip through
Germany. The train passed through
Lubeck, Hamburg and Bremen. The
trip was without incident. At Bremen
a small crowd of German soldiers and
civilians was attracted to the railway
station by the news that the train was
passing through. The party expects to
reach The Hague by noon.
BOAT OF ANCONA
PICKED UP AT SEA
Rome, Jan. 8. A fishing vessel
put in at Anzio today with a life boat
from the steamship Ancona which had
been picked up. Examination of the
boatseems to bear out the assertion
that it was fired upon and sunk, though
it carried passengers among whom
were women, by the Austrian sub
marine which torpedoed the Ancona.
Many hair pins were foui'd in the
boat. Several holes in it, apparently
made by shells from th? 3ubn.arire,
had been stopped up with shawl? and
torn skirts.

mails to and from the United States
have been held up by British war

Germany's Letter Ac

rins from America lost their lives

Adriatic.
Paris, Jan. 7 The Montene

Italian steamer from Brlndisl

German 'ote to U. S.
Washington, Jan. 8. Germany's note
accepting the American contentions
that the mere placing of non-combatants
In life boats whe- a prize is to be
destroyed is not under all conditions
to be considered assuring them a place
of safety, was made public today by
the ( state department.
The note la the latest communica
tion over the sinking of the American
sailing ship William Pt Frye and be- .
sides making the important conces- -sion
regarding the question of small
boats, takes up the question of an In
demnity for the sunken ship and for
arbitrating the disputed provisions of
the Prussian-American treaty.
Important Part Treated.
The most important part of the text
relating to the sinking of ships carry
ing contraband and the safety of non
combatants, follows:
"Until the decision of the permanent
court of arbitration, the German naval
forces will sink only such American
vessels as are loaded with absolute
contraband, when the pre-conditions
provided by the declaration of London
are present. In this the German gov
ernment shares the views of the Amer
ican government that all possible care
be taken for the security of the crew
and passengers of a vessel to be sunk.
Consequently the persons found on
board, a vessel may not be ordered in
to lifeboats except when the general
i conditions, that is to say, the weather,
the conditions of the sea and the
neighborhood of the coasts afford ab
solute certainty that the boats will
reach the netrest port.
o Loss of Life, a Point.
"For the rst the German govern
ment begs to point out that in cases
where the German naval forces have
sunk neutral vessels for carrying con
traband, no loss of life has yet oc
curred." Germany declined, however, to have
the commissioners who will settle the
Frye damages meet in Washington, be
cause it is pointed out thut the Ger
man expert, Dr. Greve of Bremen, di
rector of the North German Lloyd,
would be exposed to danger of capture
during a voyage to America, "in con
sequence of the conduct of maritime
war by England contrary to Interna
tional law."
Germany also declines to assent at
this time to the nomination of an um
pire in the absence of a determination
of whether the experts would settle,
damages or principles. Germany re
fuses to have an umpire consider the
question of principles. In case the
United States insists .hat the experts
meet in Washington and that an um
pire be named at once, Germany sug
gests that the damages be arranged by
diplomatic negotiations.
Propose Special Court.
For the arbitration of the Prussian-
American '.-eaty, Germany in the note
proposes a special court of five from
the permanent court at The Hague, of
which each country shall choose two
and the four shall choose the fifth to
meet at The Hague June 15. The spe
cial court would decide whether under
the Prussian-American treaty "the bel
ligerent contracting party Is prevented
from sinking merchant vessels of the
neutral contracting party for carrying
contraband wheu such lnkingis per
missible, according to the general
principles of International law."
The United States has contended
that the German cruiser Prins Ettel
Frederick had no right under the
treaty to gink the Frye. The German
note proposes that both parties pre
sent copies of their argument to the
court on March 1 and deposit their
counter caset and evidence on May L
