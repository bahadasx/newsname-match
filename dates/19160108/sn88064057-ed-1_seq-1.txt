Cost of Eencing
Against Hogs
The farmer of to-day is de
voting more time to the econo
mic side of his business than
ever before, and like the man
"u ac .. he is scanning the
" os sgiheet" to see where ex
cessive costs and useless ex
penditures occur so that he
may eliminate them. Just now
hundred of farmers are discov
ering that the cost for fencing
against hogs runing at large
in the vicinity of their farms
is a very exhorbitant tax to
continue a custom of the fron
tier days when "mast fed"
hogs were about the only kind
that anybody raised.
Now conditions have chang
ed, the timber is rapidly dis
appering, the rising genera
tion knows nothing about
splitting rails, most of the
good farming land is cleared
in many parishes, and must
be fenced with posts and wire.
In some sections where the
fields are continuous for miles
and miles, hogs are still al
lowed to run at large, but as
there is little for them to eat
along the roads and lanes be

tween farms, they often seek
better grounds by breaking
through the fences, and this
results in the useless destruc
tion of crops, but still worse,
in many cases its leads to bad
ifeeling among neighbors.
In order to find the com
parotive cost 'to the farmers
for fencing against hogs run
ning at large, go to the tax
records, find out the number
and value of the hogs in the
parish, estimate the number
eof miles of the farms, multiply
this by S 72.00:(the estimated
difference in cost per mile be
ween ordinary fence and hog
proof fence) and it may be
found that the excess cost of
the fences is greater than the
value of hogs. If such is the
case, the farm owners could
better afford to buy up the
hogs and destroy them than
to keep on paying out money
to fence against them.
