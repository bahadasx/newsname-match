ACCEPTS VIEW OF
U. S. GOVERNMENT
Mere Placing of Non-Combatants on
Lifeboats Is Not, Under All Condi
tions, Considered Assuring Them of
Plaoe of Safety —State Department
Makes Public German Note—Ob
jection Made to Sending Experts.
Washington, Jan. 8.—The state de
partment made public today Germany's
note accepting the American conten
tions that the mere placing of non
combatants in life boats when a prize
Is to be destroyed, is not under all
conditions to be considered assuring
them a place of safety.
The note is the latest communication
over the sinking of the American sail
,nB,
fhip William P. Frye, and besides
boats takes up the question of an- in-
More demnity for a sunken ship and for ar-
than sixty chassauers fell into our bitratlng the disputed provisions of the
Prussian-American treaty.
The most Important paft of the text
relating to ships carrying contraband
says:
"Until the decision of the permanent
court of arbitration, the German naval
forces will sink only such American
vessels as are loaded with absolute
contraband, when the pre-conditions
provided by the declaration of London
are present In this the German gov
ernment quite shares the views of the
American government that all possi
ble care must be taken for the security
of the crew .and passengers of a ves
sel to be sunk. Consequently the per
sons found on the vessel may not be
ordered into life boats, except when
the conditions, that is to say the
weather, the conditions of the sea. and
the neighborhood of the coast, afford
absolute certainty that the boats will
reach the nearest port. For the rest
the German government begs to point
out in cases where German forces Have
sunk neutral vessels* for carrying con-
Suggest Settlement by Correspondence,
"Germany declines, however, to have
the commissioners who will settle the
Frye damages meet In Washington,
because the German expert. Dr. Greve,
of Bremen, director of the North-Ger
man Lloyd line, would be exposed to
danger of capturo during a voyage to
America, in consequence of conduct of
maritime war by Kngland contrary to
International law."
It is suggested that the'3erman and
American experts might get Into touch
by correspondence.
Germany also declines at this time
to accept the appointment of an um
pire to determine whether the experts
would settle damages or principles. In
case the United States Insists that the
experts, meet in Washington ana that
an umpire be named at -once, Germany
suggests that damages be arranged by
diplomatic negotiations.
8pecial Court Is Proposed.
For the arbitration of the Prussian
American treaty, Germany proposes a
special court of five from the perma
nent court at.Tho Hague, from which
each country shall choose two and th?
four shall choose the fifth to meet at
The Hague. June 15. The special court
would decide whether under the Prus
slan-Amerlcan treaty "the belligerent
contracting party is prevented from
sinking merchant vessels of the neu
tral contracting party for carrying
contraband when such sinking Is per
missible under the principles of Inter-,
national law."
The United States has contended
that the German cruiser Bit
el Fried
rich had no right under the treaty to
sink the Frye. The German note pro
poses that both parties present copies
of their argument to the court on
March I. and'' deposit their counter
cases and evidence on May 1.

Washington, Jan. 8.—There is no

"It makes little difference now
whether we have a little more flesh

He said any perfect military sys

said, viewed the plan as a final
tested of the volunteer army sys
tem, doomed to failure, but valua
ble as a step toward some Torm of
universal military service.
CONSPIRACY CASE
JURY IN DEADLOCK
Still Deliberating on Verdict in New

Uncertainty aa to Other Defendants.
New York, Jan S.—The Jury In the

act, was still out early today.
When the Jury arrived at the federal
building to resume its deliberation, the
defendants, except William Rockefell
er, who was still ill, were in court,
eager for any information that might
throw light on the failure to reach au
agreement. Many rumors were In cir
culation, otje being that the Jurors
stood eleven to one on the question of
the guilt or Innocence of all the de
fendants, another that they had agreed
on certain of them and were dead
locked on the rest.
The Jury sent for addltonal exhibits,
several of which related to the parti
cipation of William Rockefeller In the
alleged conspiracy. The Jury also
asked for a copy of the Undted .States

Set by Wild Mob—Rioting in Prog

Soldiers Are Rushed to Scene.
Youngstown, O., Jan. 8.—Fearing a
new outbreak of rioting this morning
when a crowd of 8tr,ko
sympathizers
on the hill opposite the
Youngstown Sheet and Tube Com-
pany's plant, Brlg.-Gen. John C. Speaks
ordered four Cleveland militia com
panies of the Fifth regiments to the
strike scene. Two companies marched
into the plant to reinforce 100 strike
guards and the other two companies
patrolled the opposite hill to prevent
mob organization.
Work at the mills Is entirely sus
pended today and no attempt was
made to operate It. Three hundred
office employes are marooned In the
plant, where they spent the night for
safety.
Mob Arms at Strothers.
Two hundred citizens of Strothers,
across the Mahoning river opposite
East Youngstown, armed themselves
today and massed on a bridge to re
pel a threatened Invasion of strikers.
Fifty pounds of dynamite was placed
beneath the bridge and electrical con
nections made ready to blow it up the
moment the mob started across.
Answering an appeal from citizens
of Struthers, General Speaks sent two
companies of militia to that village
for protection from rioting there. The
message stated that a mob has formed
and is engaged in a general fight in
the streets, men shooting and beating
each other up.
Later reports said that the situation
atvStruthers was under control but
troops', would be kept on duty there tc
prevent ^further trouble
To Oeclaft Ntartfftl l-aWM#
"By afternoon state troops were In
full control of the situation at East
Youngstown and It was expected that
complete martial law would be de
clared before night in order to pre
vent any now outbreak after night
fall.
A canvass of morgues and hospitals
today gave a list of one dead and
twenty-three Injured as a result of
last night's strike rioting In East
Youngstown. Tile dorul man was not

was shot while in the act of looting a

Mob Forms at Plant.
The trouble started early In tho
evening when the day shift at tho
mills In East Youngstown, a suburb,
quit work. A mob of more than 6,000
men and women formed at the entrance
to the plant and hooted and jeered the
men, many of whom were said to bo
strikebreakers. A number of the work
ers were stoned and beaten.
The prlvato police force of the mill
was lined up on a bridge across the
river leading to the main works of tho
plant. Someone In the crowd threw a
rock, which struck one of the mill
guards.
Immediately several of the guards
drew their revolvers and fired to scare
the orowd.
Fired Into the Crowd.
Then the real trouble

Re­
volvers were produced by men in the
crowd and answering shots' were sent

Finally the crowd fell back and
vented itB fury by applying the torch
to buildings In tho neighborhood.
The first place fired was the two
story olTlee building of the sheet tad
tube plant. While the flames were
roaring Into the air, tho torch was
applied to another building, a small
one story storehouse.
Not satisfied with this exhibition of
Its fury, the mob turned to '.he busi
ness section. Part of the mob entered
a saloon, and. after looting the placo
and distributing (he liquor among the
frantic foreigners In the crowd, set
It on fire.
Crowd Begins Looting.
As the flames had spread to adjoin
ing Stores, the crowd began looting.
Clothing and jowelry were taken from
the stores and distributed thru the
crowd.
Firemen summoned from Youngstown
arrived on the scene, but before they
could get the hot« connected up with
the city hydrant's the crowd drove the
fire fighters away. Many shots were
fired and,, the firemen drove off with
thelr apparatus amid a hall of stones.
By. this time the flames threatened
to 2«.'SS|J thru th? entire uuslnvaff ssc
tion. The infuriated crowd surged
thru the streets and threats were made
to burn'the entire town. All available
guards were marshaled by the sheet
and tube company and by other mills in
the suburb in an effort to prevent de
struction of their property.
