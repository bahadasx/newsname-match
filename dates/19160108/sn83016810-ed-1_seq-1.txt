Ann Arbor, Mich.Ignorant that he

the medical faculty of the University
of Michigan last July. He was a piti
able object His body was covered
with leprous lesions.
Dr. Wile took the sufferer into the
university general hospital and has
treated him with chaul-moogra oil, a
remedy for leprosy that has been used
for generations in India, unsuccessful
ly in the great majority of cases.
Now his disease, which oftenest con
demns a man to life confinement in a
colony of his fellow sufferers, is ar
rested. The patient is making a splen
did recovery, Dr. Wile says. He is
strong and walks two miles each day.
No more men shame him by calling
him "unclean."
He is no more dangerous to any com
munity now than a tuberculosis pa
tient, Dr. Wile insists. The doctor
adds:
"Work is given to a tuberculosis pa
tient who is able to work. No one
questions his duty and right to support
himself and his family. Work should
be given to this man, once the most
despised and feared of humansa
leper."
The man's name is withheld that,
unknown, he may begin life anew and
earn bread for his wife and their baby.
His entry into the hospital was affect
ing, dramatic.
It so happened that a medical con
vention was being held here, and the
different clinics were open to the visit
ing physicians. Dr. Wile had not seen
the patient until he was wheeled into
the clinic. The doctor's face went
white. Visitors leaned forward and
peered upon the man's nude body. Then?
faces were tense, for they knewthey
thought him doomed.
The examination soon over, the pa
tient was wheeled out, and Dr. Wile
said, with emotion:
"That man has a well advanced case
of leprosy. I must tell him, and it
will seem to him like reading his death
warrant. When his disease becomes
known it is doubtful ty we can keep
him here. Even if the leprosy cannot
be arrested the man has ten years yet
before him in which he might earn a
living were it not that he will be
hounded from place to place every
man's hand will be against him."
"Is he curedwill he ever be abso
lutely cured?" Dr. Wile was asked.
"A cure is always relative," answer
ed the doctor. "At present all the
symptoms that characterize leprosy
have disappeared in this case. He is
strong, confident, hopeful. If you ask
me whether the leprous symptoms will
reappear I can no more tell you than I

Duchess of Devonshire, the "Double
Duchess," as she was called because
she captured two ducal titles in succes
sion, that of the seventh holder of the
Manchester title and the eighth of
Devonshire, could perhaps have bad
greater' political power if she could
have persuaded the indolent Duke of
Devonshire to accept the office of prime
minister. Mrs. Asquith, on the other
hand, is commonly believed to have
materially assisted her -husband to this
high office. His enemies have always
been legion and his friends not numer
ous, his character being that of the
Scotsman who forms emotional
ties with difficulty.
Mrs. Asquith, brilliant, witty, tem
peramental and intellectual and in
variably entertaining, has supplied this
deficiency and by her tact and charm
she has kept unimpaired many politi
cal friendships useful to her husband.
The withdrawal of the British forces
from the Gallipoli peninsula is credited
to Mrs. Asquith's advice, coupled with
the recommendation of Major General
C. C. Monro, who succeeded General
Sir Ian Hamilton as commander at the
Dardanelles, which was made public in
the house of lords by Lord Ribblesdale,
Mrs. Asquith's* brother-in-law.
Lady Haig, the wife of General Sir
Douglas Haig, who has taken over the
command of the British troops in
France as the successor of Field Mar
shal Viscount French, is credited with
having exerted great influence toward
her husband's advancement in the
army. She was the Hon. Maud Vivian,
one of the "Vivian twins," who were
famous as maids of honor to Queen
Victoria and Queen Alexandra. Before
his marriage to Miss Vivian ten years
ago Haig was a favorite with General
French, having served under French
at Aldershot and then accompanying
him to South Africa during the Boer
war. Whatever French has been able
to do for Haig has been done, but his
present high command is the result
more of the influence at court of Lady
Haig, and Lord Kitchener has been
persuaded by royalty's desires to ad
vance the man most favored by his
old enemy, General French. Sir Doug
las Haig was promoted to be a full
general only a year ago, although he
had held the post as chief of staff in
India for some years, having won It
through the influence of King Edward
and Queen Alexandra.
Sir Douglas and Lady Haig have not
taken any particular pains to assume
any leadership in London society since
their marriage and have not kept up a
London residence during visits home
from India, spending their time at Al
dershot, where Haig earned the nick
name of "Von Haig" on account of his
Prussian thoroughness in military mat
ters and his stern way of handling sub
ordinates. He and Lady Haig have
two children, daughters, named after
the two queens whom Lady Haig
servedAlexandra Henrietta Louise,
born in 1907, and Victoria Doris Ra

they did when he was a growing boy.
He thinks she doesn't understand the
important things of life. Later, when
his reason begins to operate, he has to
fight the inheritance of a secret sense
of man's superiority or remain hope
lessly fixed in his view of humanity as
a whole.
"One of the important things in the
education of a boy is first of-all to let
him know the physical aspect of the
country he lives in, the out of doors
world about him and the natural laws
that govern everything in it
"And how important it is that the
girls know outdoor life too! Therefore,
that the training shall be fundamental
ly alike up to the point where it natu
rally separates, it is important that
girls as well as boys shall have much
of outdoor life in their younger years.
"A great deal of the value of out
door life and work comes from the re
covery of past knowledge of how to do
things. It is a working out of the prob
lem of developmenta getting back to
the source of creation in acquiring
knowledge and efficiency in doing
things.
"I see this outdoor movement as a
vast picture. At the bottom is dark
ness, and ascending are layers of in
creasing light until the sun rays out
its full glory above. Struggling, mov
ing and growing all through these lay
ers is humanitysouls in all stages of
development. If you catch humanity
young enough the chance of letting in
the light is greater.
"If we are to develop in America dis
tinctive schools of art. music and
handicraft we must lay the founda
tions on those things which were dis
tinctly Americanwoodcraft, outdoor
life in general, the beautiful customs
of the North American .Indians and
their art and picture writing. These
we must first understand.
"Our woodcraft work is founded on
the fundamental natural laws which
were known to the North American
Indians hence many of their designs
and symbols h_ve been used in seek
ing to get back to the big construc
tive principles that govern human life.
For instance, much symbolism is used
These symbols have their outer mean
ing for the passerby^ and their deeper
spiritual significance for those who
seek it
"For our people to get the full bene
fit of the occasional respites from the
workaday world that camping trips
give they must know the wild by hearty
and this can best be done by studying,
it when young: hence thei importance
of woodcraft work for^toys and girls.
