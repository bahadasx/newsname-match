Local Vocalists To
Sing at Monongah
Douglas Fle?ing of this city has
Just completed a week's engagement
at the Dyric theatre at Monongah,
where he made quite a hit with his
spotlight songs. He has been asked
for a return engagement and will like
ly accept later.
Mr. Fleming has arranged to take
his U. C. T. Minstrel sextette too Mon
ongah one or two days next week,
where it will perform at the Lyric.
The sextotte is. composed of Fleming,
Knight, Heikes, Barrett, Wilson, T.
Hartley and J. Hartley. The list;of
names shows seven in the sextette,
which can be accounted for-by the
fact that one of the bass singers will
join in ono song, .which\he.ls espec
ially good at, but will give way to the
other bass duringNthe .'rest?of the
songs'.
Doug Fleming's work at Monongah
wag 'more than pleasing, to. the. resi

good singing.;that Falrmonters. heard
at the minstrels given: at .the'-.Qrand

LONDON The Russian offensive
still occupies the most important place
in the news of the war with the cap
ture of Czartorysk as the latest achiev
ment reported. The Russians claim
possession of the village but the Aus
trains deny they have advanced any
further than the cemetery.
The Austrians apparently are fight
ing desperately in this region In the
effort to hold their positon as a screen
for Kovel and the link between the
Austro-German army in Galicia and
those further north in the neeighbor
hood of Dvlnsk, which are threatened
with envelopment as a result of the
Russian advance.
The news regarding Czartorysk
must be taken with reserve. A Ger
man report dated later than that of
the Rusians claims that a the lost
ground has been retaken. The town
may become a second Czernowitz
which apparently is untenable by eith
er side.
On the British front in the west
the Germans have attacked near the
Lllle-Armentiers railroad' but accord
ing to official British advices have
been repulsed. Both British and
French heavy artillery wore busily
engaged yesterday
