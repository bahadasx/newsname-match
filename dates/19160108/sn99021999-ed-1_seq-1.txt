announcement that comes from Judge
Jacob Fawcett,. one of the sitting Judges
I of the supreme court at Lincoln, that in
Germany for eleven !-twuJ of ,tanJlnr for selection he will

The presumption Is 'that his opponent
will be Judge Andrew Morrlssey, who was
promoted to the position temporarily
when Governor Morehead transferred him
from a deputy attorney generalship which
had been given him aa a reward for hla
services as secretary to the governor.
The names will go on the nonpartisan
ballot to be voted on at the primary elec

election In November.
Judge Fawrelt is the only member of
the supreme court from Omaha and haa
been one of the mainstays of that trib

chief Justice when Judge Hnllenbeck died
shortly after qualifying a year ago.
Judge Fawcett Is well known to the
bench and bar of Nebraska. His long
residence ln Omaha was marked by h's

called by the voters of the state to a
place on the supreme bench, to which
he has been twice ve-elected. He now

Twenty-One Sunrirora Agree that
No Warning: Wat Given Persia
by Submarine.
NO LIGHT ON ITS IDENTITY
WASHINGTON, Jan. 7. The sub
marine crisis, still of uncertain status
because of lack of details, waa placed
oy President Wllnon before the cab
inet today In Its first meeting since
his return from Hot Springs, Va. The
senate foreign relations committee
also met to consider the situation.
Although more than a week has
rassed since the steamship Tersla
waa sunk In the Mediterranean with
the loss of American Itfe, officials
today were still .uninformed aa to
whether the vessel was torpedoed,
and, if so, the nationality of the sub
marine. Developments today con
tinue to indicate that the American
government would wlthhhold action
pending official advices determining
these points.
Penfleld Heard From.
Overnight developments Included the re
celot of dlspstches from Ambassador
Penfiold at Vienna, asaertlng that, the
Austrian government was without in
formation concerning tha Incident up to
the night of Janary 4, and from Conaul
Garrela at Alexandria, Egypt, atatlng that
he had obtaled affidavits from twenty
one survivors. Including C. H. Grant, an
American, and that all cnflrmed previous
statements that "no warning waa given
and no vessel was seen,"
Ambassador Penfleld's dispatch added
that Baron Buiian, the Austrian for
eign minister, haa asked what Informa
tion concerning the Incident was in
possession of the United States.
Officers and crew of the Persia. Con
sul Garrela reported, have left Alexan
dria for Bngland. Their affldavlta will
be aought upon their arrival there.
As the cabinet assembled It waa made
plain that the members agreed with tha
president that in the case of the Persia
nothing could be done until all the facts
were 'at. hand. Some members expressed
tha opinion that It might never be
learned whether the Persia was sunk by
a submarine ami If so, what nation was
responsible, J .
To Uaarel Aaalast Aaotaer. s
Regardless ot tha outcome of the Par
sla caas, however, the majority of the
cabinet members are represented aa be
lieving that the time has come for mak
ing certain that no further attacks on
merchant ships carrying Americans will
be made.
Tha administration leaders are said to
feel that continued loss of American lives
will lead the United States into hos
tilities. Tha Persia Incident waa taken up only
briefly at tha cabinet meeting because
Secretary Lansing had no definite recom
mendatlona to make ln tha absence of
specific facta regarding the sinking of
the ship.
One cabinet member ssld that the men
tion of tha foreign situation at tha meet
ing waa "only superficial."
