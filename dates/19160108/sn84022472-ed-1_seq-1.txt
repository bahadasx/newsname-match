" ' : : Him. '
A duel, probably atal', with horse
shoes as the weapons, was fought in
the blacksmith shop of Christopher
Rjekard, truckman, 534 Howard ave
nue, by negro s teamsters at 6 o'clock
this morning. . ' ,
- James Nixon, aged '35. is in Bridge
port hospital, his skull fractured,
probably , fatally hurt. , : '
John Henry Coleman, aged 5 4, is
under arrest, held in bail of $5,000,
on the charge of assault with intent
to kill. . j .. ; ' '- -
Coleman has told the police a thrill
ing story, of the : duel in the black
smith shop,' frankly admitting having
inflicted the probably fatal injury up
on Nixon, whom . he accuses of cruelty
to - his horses." His inhumane treat
ment of the animals , precipitated a
fight today after , two days of quar
reling, according to Coleman's state
ment.; which contains many details
showing the fight i to have been 'most
unusual. ' . .'" ' .
Nixon's custom had been to lash his
horses as the teamsters drove out 'of
the yard, each morning. He took pride
In being the first out. Coleman often
remonstrated.. ' Today , he 'grabbed
Nixon's arm. ano? again urged him to
be more gentle with the horses.
Coleman - says,-: Nixon, angered at
his interference, .snatched , a stake
from his wagon and struck him vOh
the head. Coleman attacked Nixon,
and the latter fled Into the black
smith shopi There they , grappled,
and as they'rolled over the floor, Nix
on picked up a horseshoe for defence.
Coleman avers he overpowered Nixon
and tore ths 1 horseshoe from his
grasp.. , , -, . . .
Then. .Colemansays.' he thought it
would be only fair to give the younger
man a chance to defend himself, and
seizing another horseshoe, he handed
back to' Nixon the shoe he had taken
from his grasp. Then the two made
battle feriously whlle-teamstersr ai
blacksmiths looked -on, and saw OoLe-
man vanquish Nixon. -
i Coleman drove off about his work,
and Nixon, badly worsted, but appar
ently not dangerously hurt, also start
ed'; back towards his, team,.. A few
minutes later : he , asked his, foreman
for the'day OflT, went to his home, 1034
Railroad avenue, and" collapsed. His
wife caused a jeall to be sent to the
emergency- hospitaU-for the ambulance
corps: - , ' j : '
Dr. B. B. "Weldon found that Nixon
was suffering from a fracture of -the
skull. He was rushed to Bridgeport
hospital where an operation was, per
formed upon the skull at 10 o'clock.
At a. late hour today Jittle hope was
entertained for his recovery..
'. Bridgeport hospital authorities communicated-
the f acis and the nature
of the assault to the police ana Ue-
tectives Tames Brayand James Doo-.
ley placed Coleman under arrest,
while he was at his : work : in 'the
"Bridgeport Brass. Co-s - foundry -in
HoBsatonlcavenue.
In ; a'.-statement ' giveii the police
Coleman told a straightforward story
aid admitted, assaulting Nixon, saying:
he "whaled the daylights" out of
"iNick" because the latter had been
cruel to his team-of horses and 'had
assaulted him. A ;
Nixon ;is married . and "v has - two
children. Coleman :Came here from
Charleston, S. Cv about one year ago.
He admits being arrested on a--similar
charge in Charleston - about 1 0 ' years
ago. He said that at that time he
had been robbed by. another colored
gentleman and that to "make things
even,: he '"whale the dayligits out of
that gentleman.. He was later re
leasedby order, of the court of that
place. He is a trusted employe and
said to be a peaceable workman and,
his actions of this morning came as a
great surprise to his ' fellow work

the result that three are in a hos
pital with bullet wounds and two oth
ers are in the Camden county jail af
ter a battle with citizens, policemen
and postal ' Inspectors.
Because of the great increase in
the number of employes at the Du-
Pont Powder works at Carney's Point,
N. J., Penn Grove now has a popula
tion of about 25.000. On pay day
at: the powder plant two weeks ago
an attempt was made to rob tne
post ' office and as yesterday was a
good pay day another visit from tne
robbers -was anticipated. Chief
Marshal Harbeson enlisted the ser
vices of half a dozen citizens to help
his four policemen and postal officials
sent four inspectors. All were arm
ed. ' '
The post office was surrounded at
midnieht by 7-this guard and at 2:30
a. m. the robbers silently approached
the little building from different di
rections, jimmied open the front door
and entered. ' One man stayed outside
i lookout.
SOon afterward tie posse closed in
on the lookout. Instantly the other
robbers were at the - doors and had
started shooting, the posse returning
the fire vigorously. The thieves re
treated under continuous fire of the
posse but three fell swounded.
. These were taken to the hospitaJl
where they gave their names "as John
Mayo, of St. Paul; Frank Matson, of
Galesburg. 111., and Charles Collins.
Two i other men were arrested later.
OLD INJURY MAY
HAVE LED DRIVER
sriMRAIfl'S PATH
Believe John Evarts' Death
. Was Caused By Peculiar
Occurrence.
x Ait-- injury received one year ago,
which felmost proved fatal," is believed
(by investigators to have been the in
direct cause of the death of John
Evarts, a farmer .of Hulls Farms, who
was killed last night on . the railroad
tracks near the "tin bridge.
"Evarts body, his horse ' and wagon
and the latter"s equipment were found
on the tracks. How he came there is
a mystery, but in some "quarters it , is
believed today that the .old injury to
his -head, received in. an accident at
Fairfield a year ago, caused him. to
relapse into unconsciousness.' .
Evarts body " is unclaimed.. Search
has failed to find his relatives.- I
Medical '' Examiner -( S. M. Garlick
finds that death was . accidental, al
though he cannot account for Evarts
losing his grip on the reins unless he
was suddenly rendered unconscious.
The horse is . believed to" have fallen
thrbugh,the railroad ties. "It is thought
it lay in - that ' position until the ex
press train approached.
A 'passing freight train stopped last
night when it was believed that it had
struck something. TJon investigation
it was disclosed that it had struck a
trunk which had been 1 on Evarts
fwagoh. A- search with lighten lan
terns, disclosed Evarts' dead body. It
was placed aboard a 'freight train and
brought to this city; where it will be
held at Tthe morgue of Cullinan & Mul
Jins. on. Main street until relatives
claim the body. '
Evarts, .who was 45, was a farmer
and resided in Hulls Farms. Lately
he purchased the Wakeman .place Just
back of Southport. He. paid three
months rent in advance and the time
is not up yet.
Little is known- among neighbors of
FEVarts. They recall, however, the ac
cident a year ago when an automobile,
the driver of which disappeared,
struck his wagon and hurled him from
his seat. His skull was fractured, and
he lay at death's door in a hospital for
several weeks. He recovered, how
ever. ' ''

No Funds to Bury Father,
Two Small Children Are
Desperately 111. - '
Milford, Jan. 8.Fatherless and
motherless ,the five children of Ed
mund Bartlett late of' Gulf street con
tribute today to make the' interior of
the Bartlett home one of the most pi
tiful scenes in the memory of Milford
people. ' v ..... I
Their mother died five years ago.
Desperately combatting every effort
to take one of his children from him,
and worn by the- battle to keep them
and himself alive without the aid of
their toother, the father died of pneu
monia Thursday. . Now two of the
(children are desperately ill with the
grip and they are 1 threatened ; with
pneumonia.; .' ' '
With all this trouble there is none
to aid except kind-hearted, neighbors.
There is no money in , the j house and
the body of Bartlett is 'unburied be
cause of, lack of funds. The children
have medical attention, but they can't
pay for it. They have food, too, but
the neighbors are bringing it in bas
kets. - ' '
Edmund Bartlett was a man of
modest means. He ; worked in I the
straw hat factory and made, enough
to keep his children and his wife. But,
five years ago!, trouble came to him.
His loving wife was stricken with, ill
ness and died, and the cost1 of bury
ing her weighed heavily on the family.
There were eix children. Many
made offers to take one or - more of
them off Bartlett's hands because
they are lovable children. He refus
ed. He wouldn't part with them for
love or money. There came .a day,
however, when he learned that he
couldn't work all day and . give six
children the care of which their
mother's death had robbed them.
.. Reluctantly, he parted with one
child, placing it with a relative in New
Jersey. It was a girl, as were the
rest of the children with one excep
tion. He didn't like to do it but he
had to, , f ,
Then came more tribulations and
others told him to give one or more
of his children into some kind family's
care.' He wouldn t think of it. He
(continued to toil at the shop by day
and teach his children at night. '
This cpuidn't last. Neighbors say
he couldn't stand the. ' strain. Four
days ago he became ill. He con
tracted pneumonia and died. :
The children were bereft. Neigh
bors cared for the children during the
illness, but all their solicitudes didn't
stave off more sorrow. Two of the
younger children were stricken and
they are in danger of death.
While the sympathetic women of
the neighborhood bring the children
food, there is talk or. a popular sno-
scrlption. Otherwise,' Bartlett will
go to a pauper's grave. The town will
care for the children in A- home, un
less the townspeople do ' something
privately.
