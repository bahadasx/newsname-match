STREET CORNER SAGE
New Year's Resolutions
"Now as it's gettin' along toward
New Years," remarked the Sage a few
days ago, in a hardware store as he
waited for the clerk to wrap him up a
nickle's worth of nails, "I suppose all
you fellers will be makin' a lot of New
Year's resolu,,"". I recollect one
feller 'at lived on the next farm to me,
'at used to spend a day or two makin
A the aone things. Usta have his
wife write 'em down an he'd sign 'em.
He might jist as well endorsed a note
signed by Christopher Columbus made
payable to Benedict Arnold fer all the
good it done. In less'n a week he was
back to drinkin,' smokin,' chewin' an'
cussin' worser an' ever. Last New
Year' at he lived there, he only made
one resolution, though, an' 'sfur as I
ever knowed he lived up to it to the
letter."
"What did he resolve?" asked one of
the little audience.
"He resolved not to make any more
resolutions, an' th' nex' day he got
killed in a run-a-way." And the old
man treated himself to a hearty laugh
at his own humor, as he picked up the
package of nails. "Charge 'em" he
told the clerk as he went out the door.
How Artistic Skill
Helps War Plans
One of the ingenious ideas of modern
war strategy is to utilize artist skill in
making a drawing of a fortification
'thout betraying its purport on the
,urface. The spy makes a drawing
which appears to be an ordinary land
scape. If caught with it he might pose
with comparative safety as an artist
who had been sketching for pleasure
and was entirely ignorant of the exis
tence of any fort and its surroundings.
Interpreted according to a secret
code, however, the picture reveals to
the spy's government a fairly complete
plan of a fort. This is indicated by the
, , character and position of details,
fy One kind of tree represents an ar-
Hfltaed gun-turret.
r- ' A bush is an observation turret.
Other forms of trees are gun positions,
a couple of gates are entrances to the
fort, a piece of fencing is a barbed-wire
entanglement, lines of bushes are- dit
ches and so on.

And Along Came Ruth
"Mother, I've found out a new and
simple way to clean silver," exclaimed
Ruth one afternoon, as she took off her
hat." Alice Lemon was cleaning hers
when I was over there, and it can be
done while you are at work at. some
thing else."
"Well, tell me about it," demanded
her mother."
"In the first place, you must save the
old zinc from a washboard," continued
Ruth. "Then place the zinc in a large
granite pan, with two tablespoonsful of
salt and one of soda. Add water, and
put the silver in the bath. Let it stay
for a while and when it comes out it
will have cleaned itself beautifully."
"Alice also says that if you will put
a small piece of zinc in the fire, it will
clean out the chimney."
"Well, tomorrow we will put Alice's
theory to the test," declared Ruth's
mother.
What Is a Snail's Pace?
At a snail's pace" is a common ex
pression, and usually signifies a very
slow speed. But what do you suppose
is the actual pace made by a snail in
traveling?
We can give it in accurate figures.
One foot in four minutes, or at the rate
of one mile in 16 days, if traveling con
tinuously. These are figures given by George
Zahnizer, a civil engineer, taken from
actual observation.
A short time since Mr. Zahnizer was
waiting for a train at a country station.
He had nothing in particular to do, and
'killed a little time" by timing a snail
which was creeping along the ground.
That snail traveled just exactly one
foot in four minutes. Mr. Zahnizer has
figured out that it would require 16
days for that snail to move a mile.
Products of Peat
Among the products of peat are peat
fuel and peat charcoal, with such by
products as naptha, sulphate of am
monia, acetic acid, tar and paraffin
wax, but there are aso most little al
ready an important industry on the
Continent manrue, preservative,
sheep, dips, paper, cardboard and
millboards, disinfectants, artificial
wool, surgical wool and filtering and
absorbing material. Tho suppling an
tiseptic wools and dressings the special
medicinal value rests in its use for peat
baths.
Stephen Decatur
Stephen Decatur, American seaman,
was born in Maryland in 1779. At 19
he saw service against the French and
at 20 was made lieutenant. He gained
great distinction in the naval wars with
Tripoli and Tunis and the war with
Great Britain in 1812. He was killed in
a duel with James Baron in 1820.
The Lord loveth a cheerful giver
and so do other people.
A horse may pull with all his might
but never with his mane.
ELBERT BEDE SAYS
We can all get jobs working for the
upbuilding of the community and the
pay is both large and certain.
A woman who pays $500 for a dress
has had something hung en to her and
not very much either, perhaps.
Folks persist in saying that matches
are made in heaven. Mapbe they're
used to start the fires in hell.
Wouldn't there be a terrible turmoil
in this old world if we executed half
the dire thing we work out in our
minds.
It's a mighty good-for-nothing woman
who can't support one man and an en
tirely good-for-nothing woman who
tries it.
While some of us are casting around
for opportunity, others would consider
it the greatest opportunity of a life
time to be in a position we are so anx
ious to cast aside.
The person who doesn't want the
things he can't get it quite likely to be
fairly contented, but if we all stopped
with the things that are easily attained
what a slow old world this would be.
We always imagine that to-morrow
we will have so much more time to do
things than we have today and when
tomorrow comes we wish we had done
them in the time we wasted yesterday.
If we could be contented with mind
ing our own business we wouldn't
learn a lot of things that make us un
happy and would save others from tell
ing a lot of things which make them
unhappy to tell.
When one man says another is a
crook and the second one retaliates by
saying the first is a crook we stop and
wonder how much of the truth each is
telling. To speak ill of another quite
often reacts on the speaker.
When a person makes a great show
of honesty when only a few cents is
concerned we wonder what chance
there would be if a large sum were
concerned. Also we have seen people
who thought it is no crime to keep a
few cents that did not belong to them
who would be absolutely honest if a
large sum were concerned.
USING SOUR MILK
Very often sour milk is thrown away
because the ignorant cook does not
know how to make use of it. Sour
milk may not only be used for biscuit,
but for waffles, gingerbread, cake of
various kinds and even salad dressing
and ice cream, provided that it is pro
perly sweetened with soda. Thick
sour milk requirest the proportion of
an even teaspoonful of soda to each
pint of the milk. Thin milk, of which
there is less curd than whey requires
more soda. The soda should always be
well dissolved in the milk or sifted in
to the flour if it is not to collect in
lumps and show its presence.
A House Without
Broom or Match
'A house without a broom or a
match, without coal or gas would have
been a wonder ten years ago," observ
ed a newly-wed at the regular meeting
of the Home Efficiency Club. I have
started my married life with the broom
and the match and the coal .scuttle
banished forever."
But there will be brooms for a good
many years yet, just as the old-time
candle still survives in some districts,
although modern homes are fast adapt
ing the electrical method. It was
Franklin who jested about electric
cooking and like many another of those
old jests, electric cooking has come in
to being. Housewives find the throw
ing on of a little switch a welcome
labor saver. Besides, little heat is
wasted and none radiates out into the
room to make it unsufferably hot.

JUDGE F. W. MAYNE
CANDIDATE FOR
SUPREME JUDtiE.
The below endorsement of Circuit
Judge F. W. Mayne for the supreme
court bench appeared in Monday's
issue of the Traverse City Record
Eagle.
Northern Michigan will have a can
didate for supreme judge at the Re
publican primaries this year in the per
son of Judge Fredrick W. Mayne of
Charlevoix, who has for the past fifteen
years sat on the bench on the thirteen
th judicial circuit. Judge Mayne is
peculiarly fitted for the Michigan su
preme bench as he has made an envi
able record as a circuit judge, for few
of his decisions have ever been rever
sed by the higher court. His public
career has been a long and honorable
one during which time he has been
prosecuting attorney of Charlevoix
county two terms, judge of probate
one term and he is now serving his
third term as circuit judge. He has
been a resident of this region since
1878 which fact entitles him to be class
ed as one of the pioneers of Grand
Traverse. It is a significant fact that
he is the only candidate for the su
preme bench north of Grand Rapids
and this fact, coupled with his fitness
for the position should insure him the
solid support of all the counties in the
northern part of the state. It is also a
fact that all the federal judges also
come from the territory south of cen
tral Michigan. Northern Michigan is
too large and important to be ignored
in choosing judges for the highest court
in the state and the opportunity is now
at hand for emphasizing this fact
throughout the state and securing the
support of the entire state for a candi
date from this part of Michigan. Judge
Mayne is well and favorably known
throughout the state, as his duties as
circuit judge have carried him as far
south as Detroit, where he has presid
ed over many important cases. Al
ready he has been given unanimous
endorsement for the supreme bench by
the bar associations in all the counties
in the thirteenth judical circuit which
emphasizes the standing that he has
among the members of the legal pro
fession. Judge Mayne has a splendid
chance to win the nomination and it is
up to the voters in the state to see to
it that Northern Michigan is given due
consideration and through him repre
sentation upon the supreme bench of
the state of Michigan."

ON THE FIRING LINE.
Postmaster General Burleson says
that in the past few years the postal
system has entered upon a still broader
service to the people, and he cites the
postal savings system and the parcel
post as instances. Thanks, Mr. Burle
son. Both of these measures were
passed by Republican Congresses. The
postal savings law was enacted with
your opposition. The parcel post was
enacted without any evidence what
ever of your active support. You were
a member of Congress and had an op
portunity to help in the establishment
of both. You opposed one and if you
helped in the other there is nothing in
the record to show it. In fact, every
vote in opposition to the postal savings
bank was cast by a Democrat. Still, we
can forgive your opposition in the past
since you now acknowledge the merit
of Republican legislation.
A remarkable feature of the annual
report of Secretary of the Treasuay Mc
Adoo is the presentation of three
special reports by mercantile agencies,
testifying to the restoration of in
dustrial prosperity. These reports
were made at the request of the Secre
tary himself. 'Two deductions are al
most unavoidable: first. Mr. McAdoo
doubted whether the American people
would believe that prosperity has re
turned unless he so informed them in
his report; and, second, he doubted
whether they would accept the state
ment on his own authority, and. there
fore, backed it up by the testimony of
three mercantile agencies. This is
certainly not very complimentary
either to the intelligence of the Ameri
can people or to the reputation of Mr.
McAdoo. We are certainly in a sad
state of affairs if the American people
do not know they are enjoying oros-
perity unless they are so informed by
oniciai reports. We are also in a bad
way if reliance cannot be placed upon
the statements of the Secretary of the
Treasury unless confirmed by private
agencies, selected by himself for cor
roborative purposes. We repeat, this
is a remarkable feature of an annual
report of a Secretary of the Treasury.
New York dispatches say that shiD
building companies have orders for all
the vessels that can be constructed and
delivered in the next two years, yet
the administration wants a government
owned shipping system established.
Because this is a neutral country
many foreign ships sought register
under the American flag and have been
doing a thriving business at high freight
rates, due entirely to the war. When
the war is over and that traffic ends,
as it necessarily will, freight rates will
slump accordingly. Ships which are
now so highly valued will become
relatively a drug on the market. Ships
now undef the American flag will seek
entry under other nations in order to
secure the advantages of lower wages
and cheaper operation.
During the past two years American
farmers harvested nearly 45 per cent
more wheat than in any previous two
year period. Anticipation of high
prices on account of the war induced
increased acreage. Many fields that
would otherwise have been summer
fallowed were planted to crops. Many
of these fields now need a rest and
statistics show that the acreage sown
in the fall of 1915 is 89 per cent of that
sown in 1914. The war production of
wheat has been larger than anticipated.
When the Democrats look over their
record and think of the campaign
ahead of tkem, they doublless would
like to induce the American voters to
"let-by-gones be by-gones."
Now the question is, what will be the
next subject upon which President
Wilson will change his mind?
All men are more or less prejudiced
not because they want to be, but be
cause they can't help it.
Hard work never kills a man. But
scheming how he may be able to put in
the most time n a short job saps up
his vital energy.
COLD WEATI1ER ACHES AND PAINS.
Many aches and pains, sore muscles,
stiff joints and much rheumatism
attributed to cold weather have their
first cause in failure of the kidneys to
