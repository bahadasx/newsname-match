j the United States was "hypo
; critically claiming to be neutral,
I when it was in fact participating
in the war through the sale of inn
nitions. Senator Lodge, rank
ing republican member of the
foreign relations committee, de
clared that to place an embargo
on arms now would be worth
more to Germany than a million
men. that it would be a "grossly
unneutral act" and would in fact ;
make the United States the ally
of Germany. Senators O'Gorman
New York and Hitchcock of Xe
braska. both democrats, urged the
advisability of an enrbareo on
munitions. Senator O'Gorman
also informed the senate that
American consul R. X. McXeely.
who lost his life on the British
liner Persia, had disregarded the j
advice of American Consul-Gene
ral Skinner at London that h.,
make the journey to Aden on a
Dutch vessel.
To Take Chances
Not Patriotic.
The discussion was precipitated
when Senator Jones read a news
paper editorial urging American
eitizens to keep off belligerent
ships and advising the president
to proceed slowly in tlie present
crisis, heeding the interest of
ninet-nine million rather tliâii
that of a '"thousand reckless, in
considerate and unpatriotic citi
zens who insist on traveling on
belligerent ships."
j Senator Nelson of Minnesota,
republican, aroused Senator
O'Gorman by asking whether
Senator Jones regarded Consul
McXeely unpatriotic because he
sailed for his post on the Persia,
; After the New York senator had
explained that McXeely had de
clined to heed Consul-General
Skinner's advice to sail on a
Dutch ship. Senator Works blazed
the way to general debate on the
position of the United States in
the -
can
Lusitania Loaded |
I With Ammunition. !
I Asserting at the outset that the!
government shared responsibility
for deaths of Americans on the
Lusitania, the California senator
said:
I "The government knew that
the Lusitania was loaded to the
j guards with ammunition and ex
plosives. Passen ire rs were per
mittej in spite of this to travel on
the vessel. The srov eminent it
war by declaring the Ameri
government was not neutral. !
itn/nia
... .he government
self, in full knowledge that the
ship earrid munitions of war, is
morally responsible for the death
of our citizens." _
When Senator Works declared)
the United Stotes actually was
participating in the war by the
s fle of munitions Senator Reed,,
democrat, interrupted to ask: •' j
Germany Made
First Loan in U. S. I
"Does the senator not know
that the .first-loan* placed in the
United States after the war be
P sn Avas a loan of .$20,000.00 (1 to
Germany and that the loan was
made without protest from him or
any other citizen? Does the sen
ator not knoAv that Germany pro
cured arms in this country as
long as it Avas possible for her to;
S<*t them ?" j
"That may all be true.' Sena- :
tor Works replied,
l,..t that does
not alter tlie situation."
",]f it he true," continued Sen
ntor Reed, "that the markets of
this country are free and open to
Germany as well as to all other
countries and that this govern
ment does not distinguish be
tween any heiligeren 4 nation .,
then how can the senator say that
this government has taken an un- 1
neutral position?"
"If j s impossible to get arms to 1
Germany and I say it is morally j
wrong for this government to per- j
mit shipment of arms to any of the !
belligerents," Senator Works in-,
sisted. lie added that his princ
ipal objection was based on a con-1
viction that the United States was
aiding in prolonging the war and:
the killing of men and that he
would not only put an embargo j
on munitions but also on ship
ment of food and clothing to the
armies of Europe.
Our Markets Open
to all Nations.

position of the United States as!

and others.
"Our markets are open to all
the world to buy," said Senator
Lodge. "We have taken no ne
tion to prevent any belligerent or
anyone else from buying in our
markets and we are at peace with
the world."
"A condition has been created
by this Avar and by the war alone
which prevents one or more bel

ket. If we undertake to reverse
a condition created by the war,we
at once enter into the war and
that is an act of unneutralitv."
"Evidently in time of war such
as is now disturbing the peace of
the world." Senator O'Gorman re-1
joined, "almost any act of a neu
tral power would be rc.irded '
[some as an act of partiality but in
my judgment this go\erument. if
..it deemed it best for the American'
nation and tlie best of peace Avith
a ll the natfons. could place an e- j
bar go against the shipment of irv
