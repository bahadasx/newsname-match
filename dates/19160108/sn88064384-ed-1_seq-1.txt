KEEP COOL

an buy the kind of c >a that wib
keep you cool with the fewest
trips to the cellar Try our coal
this year. You'll find it goes so
much farther than ordinny fuel
that when warm weather comes
arouad you'll have a nice little
pile left to start the next season
on. That proves it's coal economy
to buy here.

IldWii Hüll JiiüCO 11'*!
The hand of the reformer
has reached out and desecra
ted the mince pie. Kxeis
ofiieials of t'i.lorado view with
horror the danger of intoxi
cation which they claim,
I rests within the mince pie,
and have decreed that in
I future all traces of brandv
slmll be omitted from the
delectable dessert. YVe have
no quarrel with the excise
officials of C dorado, but we
i ask if this is not carrying the
j enforcement of a prohibitory
aw too fai ?
martyr of the mince pie is
striking pretty close to home.
It would give the civil au
Making
mince pie
tiiorities power, for instance,
I to enter the home, sample
j tiie mince pie before the Lam
! ily had a chance at it and,
J if they found it especially
delightful, to condemn it and
J carry it away with them to
eat it quietly and happily
when they reached a seclud
ed spot. The authorities
could not be blamed for this,
exactly, because we have a!!
seen mince pies which no
human could resist. Its the
family which has the kick
coming. The wise house
wife knows that it is not ne
cessary to put brandy into
mince pie to make it appeal
ing to palate. Others be
lieve that the brandy gives
it a Ling which itcould never
attain without the use of
alcohol. One famous cook
explained the difference bet
ween mince pie with brandy
and that without brandy
was that the latter was
"hash." Be that as it may,
anybody will te l you if he
happens to know—that the
alcohol which gets into the
mince pie, gets out again
in the process of cooking.
Immediately the legal ques
tion will arise in Colorado,
"When is a pie?" In all
probability the courts will be
called upon to determine
whether a pie is a pie before
it is cooked, or after it is
cooked. If the latter is the
case the pie-maker can only
be ciiarged with a violation
of the prohibition law when
the pie inspector calls before
the pie goes into the oven.
This, of course, makes it ex
tremely difficult for the in
spector. Aside from the
satire, however, the question
remains 1'Hcw long will the
American public stand such
absurdities of law-making
and law-interpretation?"
The Fable of (he Loafer.
Once upon a time there
was a "good-for-nothing,"
who refused to follow his
father's trade of stone-cutter
and became a loafer. He
was fat and ugly, with a
short bull-neck, a round,
bald head, thick lips, pro
truding eyes and snub nose.
He spent his time talking,
with whomsoever would lis
ten to him. He respected
no one, rich or poor. He
loved a joke, went barefoot
and allowed his clothes to
become soiled. He spent
. mostof his time drinking at

nature of the contents a
friend knew it was essential
that the box should not lie

He ventured to suggest to
Pat to write conspicuously
on the case: "This side up

afterward, steing Pat again,
he asked: "Heard any more
about your goods? Did they
get there safely ?"
"Every one of them broke, "

"The whole lot? Did you

"Yes, I did. And for
