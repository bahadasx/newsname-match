Intcni;.tier;al Ns Srl'-e:
WASHINGTON. Jan. .v. Ah a re
sult of German concessions a com
plete settlement of the submarine
fontrovprsy with the eentra.1 Teu
tonic jowers became a strong pos
sibility today. I'res't Wilson took
up consideration of the Orman
proposition de-signed to settle the
Lusitarda case ami that nation's
voluntary announcement of submar
ine polity In the Mediterranean a"
well as in th" North sea. He was
admittedly very much gratified with
the latter communication.
Comir.rr unsolicited and amplify
ing' and emphasizing promise.-; al
ready made, it was accepted as
showing an earnest desire on the
part of the Herman empire to se
cure :t common understanding be
tween the two nations. Inasmuch
as (.Jermany dominates her allied,
they can be expected to endorse her
policy and accept it as their own.
The belief is growing in official
circles that the sinking of the Per
sia will not be cleared up. So far
Austria has no word that one of her
submarines was responsible. Ger
many has no Information whatever
regarding the loss of the liner, ac
cording to Count von Rernstorff. It
may yet be shown that a German
nnd not an Austrian submarine, was
responsible as there, mo rumors in
official circles that one or two have
been operating from a Turkish base.
Tint fo far all of the evidence secured
by the United States has failed to
fdiow that any submarine was in the
vicinity when the Persia went down.
If no nation assumes responsibil
ity the United States can do nothing.
Officials familiar with the situation
frankly hay that they feel certain
that none of the Teutonic belliger
ents will deny responsibility should
one of their submarine commanders
report that he sank the Persia. In
the absence of any such admission,
officials say, this government will
smuggest diplomatically that all of the
Teutonic allies reathrm the latest
Gorman submarine policy.
So far ay the Lusltania note hand
ed to Sec'y Lansing is concerned, of
licials say that. I'rcs't Wilson will
decide whether it is satisfactory, but
that they believe that it shows con
clusively an earnest desire on the
part of Germany to meet the de
mands of this government. As al
ready pointed out in these dispatch
es, Germany is Avilling to pay indem
nity for the loss of American Ii' es
on the steamer, but feels that :he
cannot specifically disavow the act
l ecause iL was ordered by the admir
alty as an act of reprisal for the
blockade of Germany by the Rritish
navy.

issues of his campaign. After a bit
ter fight he was again elected two
years ago. His reputation as an uu-
1 thorlty upon the subject has result
ed in his taking an active part in a
number of organizations over the
country promoting municipally own
ed utilities and Mayor Keller be
lieves that his address here will
prove impressive upon the citizens
of the community.

It.ternatior.nl News Service:
LONDON, Jan. 8. Itussian war
ships in the Black sea are agaii:
bombarding the Bulgarian ports of
Varna and Euxinograd. according to
a Central News dispatch from
Genoa.
King Ferdinad's summer palace is
situated at Euxinograd, which is
only a short distance north of Varna.
Associated Pres Service:
LONDON. Jan. 8. Some idea of
the determined nature of the Rus
sian blow on the Bessarabian front
is conveyed by retrograd dispatches
Friday which state that the Rus
sians for 50 hours concentrated 400
guns on the Austrian position at
Czernowitz, as a preparation for an
infantry attack. The Russian com
munications do not yet claim that
Czernowitz has fallen but dispatcher
from German sources admit the Teu
tonic position there is critical.
It is not yet clear whether the
Russian operations in this theater
herald a bigger offensive movement
of 11 the Russian -armies from the
Baltic to the Roumanian border or
merely indicate k" diversion of un
paralleled magnitude and fierceness
designed to weaken the pressure of
the central powers ih"-1he Balkans
and incidentally on the Italian front.
The lighting has been of the most
bitter character, according to both
tho Austrian and Russian reports.
Few prisoners are beins taken and
the infantry engagements arc large
ly in the nature of lu-nd to hand
encounters.
Move Along Rallas.
All of the Russian operations thus
far revealed are being pressed along
the railway lines, which simplify
tho problem of the winter supply
of food, ammunition and fuel.
Tho situation along other fronts
is comparatively quiet.
The loss of a British submarine
off the Dutch coast makes a total of
11 British submarines lost since the
beginning of the war. A majority
of these, however, have been of the
smaller types.
An echo of Gen. Sir Ian Hamil
ton's important review of the Dar
danelles operations is found in a re
port published today that Gen. Sir
Frederick Stopford, who was re
called on account of his conduct in
the i?uvla bay operations had de
manded an inquiry by the war office
into the whole circumstances of the
landing of troops in the Dardanelles.
Nino I rain Ships Out.
In connection with the submarine
activities in the Mediterranean sea,
an Athens dispatch notes that alarm
is felt there owing to the fact that
none of the nine ships laden with
grain purchased in America, either
has arrived or been signalled.

NEW HAVEN JURY
NABLE T√ú AGREE
After Night Spent in Hotel It
Resumes Deliberations
Saturday Morning.
International News SerTire:
NEW YORK, Jan. 8. Following
a night spent at the hotel Knicker
bocker, the jury In the conspiracy
caes of 11 former directors of the
New York, New Haven and Hartford
railroad, resumed their deliberations
at the federal building at 10 o'clock.
When the Jurors retired to their
rooms it was reported that a ma
jority of them stood for acquittal.
Prospects for a verdict waned as
the early evening hours passed with
out any sign from the jury room
that an agreement was near. Tire
case was submitted to the jurors for
decision shortly before 1:3C o'clock
in the afternoon and it was reported
to be the purpose of the court, if
they falied to reach a verdict be
fore 11 p. m., to lock them up for
the night at an uptown hotel. All
of the defendants except William
Rockefeller, who was ill, were pres
ent in the court room to hear the
verdict. They faced the possibility
of jail sentences of a year should
the case go against them.
Judge Speaks Two Hours.
The acquisition of the Boston &
Maine was one of the phases of the
case upon which Judge Hunt in his
two hour and a half charge to the
Jury Friday laid special stress. He
held that the question was whether
the New Haven and the Boston
Maine were in substantial competi
tion. Judge Hunt's charge was regard
ed by many in the court as favorable
for the defense. He held that the
jurors must lirst satisfy themselves
that the alleged conspiracy to mo
nopolize the commerce in New Eng
land r.tust have been continuous
from the date named in the indict
ment, that of the enactment of the
Sherman law, 1890 until the date tho
'ndictment was found. Otherwise
the government's case failed, he
said.
The defendants in that event must
be acquitted, he said, "no matter
j 'nv.v guilty they might be thoucht
to be of other crimes not named in
the indictment."

International News Service:
LONDON, Jan. 8. Further modi
fications in the military service bill
are likely. The Chronicle expresses
the belief that the measure will
undergo further attentuation in its
committee stage to meet some of the
objections now levelled against it.
particularly by the labor element.
The possibility that parliament
will be dissolved and a general elec
tion called still exists; in fact, that
contingency will not have passed
until the conscription bill is a law.
But the supporters of Premier As-
quith are taking under consideration
the suggestion that has been made
that the question of compulsory mil
itary service be submitted to a ref
erendum as an alternative to a gen
eral election. However, the refer
endum idea has received slight sup
port and is regarded as unlikely of
accomplishment.
Parliament was not in session to
day, but debate upon the bill will bo
resumed when both houses again go
into session on Monday.
To Vote for Measure.
George H. Roberts, who resigned
a3 lord commissioner of the treas
ury, declared in an interview in tho
Express that, despite his scruples
against conscription, he would vote
for the military service bill when it
comes up in commons on second
reading on Tuesday.
He added that Arthur Henderson,
former president of the board of
education, and William Brace, under
secretary for homo affairs, would
also vote for the measure, notwith
standing the fact that they had left
the cabinet because it had decided
on conscription.
The fight of the unionist faction
under Sir Edward Carson, against
the exclusion of Ireland from the
compulsory service bill and their ef
forts to overthrow the Asquith min
it-try, has extended until it includes
other issues of national importance.
It is reported on reliable authority
that one of the ambitions of Sir Ed
ward Carson is to repeal the home
rule for Ireland bill if he and his
followers are able to get control of
the government.
