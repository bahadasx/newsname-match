Stock Market Recovers
From Recent Decline
(Copyright 1015 by the New York Ev

New York, Jan. 8. Tho tendency of
the stock murket to recover continue tn.
any. tins was offset, however, by re
newed selling. This may have been he-
cause the Austrian attitude on the Per
sia ease will still be in doubt over Sun
dny. It is more urobable. though that
tho hostility shown by numerous high
practical authorities towards specula
tions in wnr stocks left a sense of un-
'ertainty on Wall street. These stocks
"bowed a hesitant or .reactionary ten
lency most distinctly. Kti.i.l knni
nowever, did likewise, and although
railway slmres wcro strong, even they
moved with no grent decision.
Sterling exchange recovered sharply
from yesterday's decline. Berlin ex-'
chnngo recovered too, probably by reas
on of a nnturnl speculative reaction fol
lowing the extraordinary three cent
break this week.
The amount of monoy expended on a

preparedness last evening by President
William T. Foster of Eeod college, in
his address at the Salem public library.
Dr. FoBter takes the view held bv

to become engaged in war.

As to his opinion of Roosevelt, mid
President Wilson, Mr. Foster believes
that if Roosevelt had boon presidont,
we would have been at war with sev

and for this reason, President Wilson
was the man of tho hour for his efforts
in favor of peaco and also in keeping

that this country should havo nothing

STATES SETTLES
WITH CENTRAL POWERS
Submarine Controversies Are Brought To Close By Pledge
of Germany to Respect In Full Regulations Insisted
Upon By United States-Disavowal of Unlawful Acts of
Commanders and Full Indemnity For Losses Is Guaran
teed By Central Powers
Washington, Jan. 8. Complete and final settlement of
all submarine coitroversies with the central powers, in
cluding the Persia and Lusitania cases seem near today,
following overtures from Germany yesterday. Pessimism
has been dissipated.
From Austria and Germany, the government has
formal binding pledges concerning future conduct of
submarine warfare in accordance with international law.
These were contained in Austria's Ancona note and ia
Germany's submarine message yesterday. .
Now the administration is concerned only over repar
ation in the Persia and Lusitania cases.
Germany's promised disavowal of the Persia incident
if it should prove one of her submarines was responsible.
is believed to be the fore-runner of , similar action on
Austria's part.
Having promised reparation in the Lusitania case, the
only thing now necessary to a settlement is a disavowal.
WHAT GERMANY PROMISES
She pledges herself to obey
international law witii regard
to both passenger ships und
merchant vessels.
She will give time for those
aboard to reach places of Bufo-
She will grant indemnity and
punish the commnud'sr if it
proves a German submarine
torpedoed the liner Persia.
Sho agrees with America that
safety for passengers is not
afforded by small boats unless
the sea is calm and land nenr.
Henceforth she will seo they
are not set adrift in rough
weather in small boats.
Sho promises reparation for
the American Lusitunia victims.
Further evidence of a settlement of
controversies came today in the Ger
man note of November 30 in the Wil
liam P. Fryo sinking caso, made pub
lie by Socretury Lansing. In thin was
revealed a complete agreement witlt
the American position, Germany pe
cificly agreeing that passengers shall
not be put to sea in small boats unless
the sea is calm and land near.
Thoro was no nutiiority today for tlm
statement that the administration will
not, Insist upau an unequivocal disa
vowal of the Lusitania torpedoing.
Germany's promise of reparation may
bo considered sufficient, howover, tu
meet American demands in tha rase.
The failure of Austria and Germany
to receive any report of tho Porsit.
sinking led to the bolicf that the
cause may never bo known.
Consul Gaulin of Marseilles report
ed that Rev. Homer Salisbury of tha
District of Columbia, reported missing
in tho Persia caso, was traveling un
der a London permit.

Attorney Job Harriman's
Scheme Legalized by
State of California
Sacramento. Cal., Jan. 8.--Whllo per-
mittinir Llano Del llio compnny, tho
socialist colony oignnizution started by
.lob llHrriman, to proceed with tho Bale
of Its Khares under certain restrictions,
Htuto Cornorution Commissioner tarn
nhnii, In a pemit signed today, ciiIIb
t ho attention of prospective subscribers
to a report on tho project ty deputy
II. W. ISowmnn, severely criticising tho
present course of management.
Tho report indicates that tho enter
prise, established ns a self supporting,
co-operntivo colony, in winch every
stockholding member should have abso
lutely equal rights, has developed into
1111 Autocracy ruled by Job llurrimnn;
that the rit'lit of protest is practically
denied to the colonists under peniilty
of dismissnl and that tho penalty 1b
particularly severe in view of tho fact
that most of the colonists 1invc invest
ed their all In the company 'b stock and
have no way ot recovering their in
vestment except by help of the com
pany whoso displeasure they have in
curred.
Tho company, capitalized at 2,()00,-
000, was formed for the purpose or
holding tho colony property, situation
in the Mojnvo district on Dig Hock
crook in Los Angeles county. About II.1O,
men, women and cliiiarcu now 101 111 1110
community.
"In the company's liternture." says
tho report, "there is n studied effort
to induco the belief that the influence
of each stockholding colonist in tho
control of tiie company's nffnirs is
equal to that of any other. Tho fact Is
that the colony is ulmoHt autocratically
dominated anil controlled by one mun
.lob Harrimnn. Ho hns not hesitated
to use his Influence with the board of
directors in the most harsh and drastic
manner to enforce subjection to Ins
control."
Tho employment contract which culls
for a wngo of iM per day is declared
by Deputy Ilowuiun to be a misrepre
sentation. "In practice," says How
man, "tho nverngo daily wnge of the
average stockholder maintaining him
self and two others at tho colony is
1.40 or less."
No criticism is made of tho diame
ter of tho project but it Is held that
the success of the colony depends up
on a high degreo of intelligence, abil
ity and industry and superior manage
ment. "As tho company is now being;
oporated," Bays tho report, "it's plaa
is unfair, unjust ami inequitable to s,
substantial proportion of its stock
holders, and unless further colonists'
are obtuined to pay off indebtedness
and carry it along with cash payments
tho project must fail entirely and a ma
jority of too colonists who havo put
everything they hpd Into the com
pany's stock will be wholly pauperized
and left destitute"
In his permit, Commissioner Carna
hnn cuts the commission to be allowed
on sales of shares to 10 per cent of the
amount actually paid In cash to tha
company. Ho nUo provides that col
onists may withdraw from tho project
nnd tho company must assist tiiem to
recover 00 per cent nf their cash or
property investment through ro-sulo of
their shares.
