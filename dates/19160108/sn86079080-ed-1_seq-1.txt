Women W. 0. W. Chief Resent Attacks On Pleasant.
State Grand Guardian Calls Poster Attack "lost Depicable
Against Candidate."
Heartily indorsin-, the course of Woodmen camps in condemnation
of the attacks made because a poster of Colonel It. G. Pleasant,
candidate for governor, was found in a Jefferson parisn hall, raided
by Governor Hall's militia, Mrs. Amelia Smith, grand guardian of
tne Woodmen Circle, calls; the attack "about the most despicable
ting that I nave ever heard of being used against a candidate for
public office."
Mrs. Smith, as grand guardian, is the representative of the Wood
men Circle of the State, and in a letter addressed to B. J. Morath,
consul commander of Oleander Camp. No. 74, who defended the
action of placing a Pleasant picture in the Jefferssn parish hall, de
clares the hall in question is "of the highest standard, ai. attended
by the best people in this city. T
The indorsement of the grand guardian, in full, is as follows:
I have read in the press your statement that the picture of
Colonel Pleasant, found in the hall near the Protection Levee
which was raided by the militia, was placed there by you as a
friend and supporter of Colonel Pleasant, on acoount of the hall
being frexuently used by the Woodmen, and
various other fraternal and charitable organizations. for social
gatherings. I have also read your telegram to Mr. Marbry, and
I am writing this to say that I heartily indorse your telegram
and approve of your course in this matter.
The several social gatherings held in this hall were of the
highest standard, and attended by the best people in the city,
and I feel that the exploiting of this hail as "the lowest dive in
Louisiana," is not only a reflection on the good men and good
women who have been'in the habit of attending the social affairs
held there, but it is about the most despicable thing that I have
ever heard of being used against a candidate for public office,
A copy of Mrs. Smith's letter to Mr. Morath was given out Athe
Pleasant headquarters Tuesday morning and along with it came the
announcement that already twelve Woodmlen camps had approved
of Mr. Morath's defense of his position in placing the Pleasant pos
ter in the hall recently raided by the State militia.
These camps are: Hyacinth, Beacon, Excelsior, Elysian Fields,
rulane, Olive. Oleander, Willow, Palmetto, Hickory, Live Oak and
Eureka.
The camps have all adopted the following resolutions:
"Whereas, certain newspapers and individuals advocating the
claims of certain candidates and the headquarters of one of the
candidates for governsr have seen fit to use as campaign matter
the finding of a picture poster of another one of the candidates for
governor in a hall raided by Governor Hall's militia in Jefferson
parish and
"Whereas the hat' above referred to is frequently used by the W.
0. W. and the Woodmen Circle and other fraternal organizations
for social gathering of the members of these orders and their
wives, daughters, mothers and sisters: and
"Whereas the New Orleans Item has been using this incident
seeking to injure the candidacy of one of the candidates for gover
nor, attempting to arouse prejudice against this.candjdate Tby de
nouncing this hall as the 'the lowest dive in Loutsiana,' and said
lenunciation is being used by the headquarters of one of the candi
dates for governor; thet fore, be it
"'Resolved, By Hyacinth Camp, No. 387, W. O. W., that we
heartily approve and indorse tne course of Sovereign B. J, Morath,
Consul Commander, Oleander Camp, No. 74, in defending his posi
pion in this matter, and we deprecate most sincerely the use of this
Sincidents in a political, campaign, and do not hesitate to denounce
I such politics, not only as unclean but an insult to the intelligence of
the voters of Louisiana."
