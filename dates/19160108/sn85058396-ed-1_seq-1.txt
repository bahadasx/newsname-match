WOULD ARBITRATE
THE FRYE CASE
Text of Document Sent to
United States From Berlin
Is Made Public.
IMPORTANT CONCESSION
Decline to Meet in Washing
ton to Settle Damages for
Sinking of American
Vessel.
Washington. Jan. S The state de
partment made public today German's
note accepting the American conten
tion that the mere placing of non
combatants in lifeboats when a prize
is to be destroyed Is not under all
conditions to be considered assuring
them a place of safety.
The note is the latest communica
tion over tho sinking of the American
sailing ship William P Frye and be
bides making the jinnortant concession
regarding the question of small boats,
takes up the question of an indemnity
for the sunken ship and 'for arbitrat
ing tho disputed provioions of the
Prussian-American treaty.
Important Part of Text.
The most important part of the text
relating to the sinking of ships carry
ing contraband and the safety of no
combatants, follows:
"Until the decision of the permanent
court of arbitration, the German naval
forces will sink only such American
vessels as are loaded with absolute
contraband when the prey-conditions
provided by the Declaration of Lon
don are present. In this the German
government quite shares the views of
the American government that all pos
sible care must be taken for the se
curity of the crew and passengers of
a vessel to be sunk. Consequently the
persons found on board a vessel may
not be ordered Into lifeboats when the
general conditions, that is to say, the
weather, the conditions of the sea and
the neighborhood of the coasts assure
certainty that the boat will not reach
the nearest port. For the rest the
German government begs to point out
that In cases where the German gov
ernment has sunk neutral vessels for
carrying contraband no loss of life
has vet occurred "
Declined to Meet in Washington.
Germany declined, however, to have
the commissioners who will settle the
Frye damages, meet in Washington
because it Is pointed out that the Ger
man expert, Dr. Greve, of Bremen, di
rector of the North German-Lloyd line,
would be exposed to danger of cap
ture during a voyage to America "In
consequence of tho conduct of mari
time warfare by England contrary to
international law."
It is suggested that the German and
American experts might get into
touch by correspondence.
Refuses to Have Umpire.
Germany also declines to assent at
this time to the nomination of an um
pire "in the absence of a determination
of whether the expeits would settle
damages or principles. Germnny re
fuses to have an umpire consider the
case of principles, In case tho United
States insists that the experts meet
in Washington and that an umpire be
named at once, Germany suggests that
tho damages be arranged by diplo
matic negotiations.
"For the arbitration of the Prussinn
American treaty, Germany proposes
a special court of five from the perm
anent court at The Hague of which
each country shall appoint two and
the four shall choose the fifth to meet
at The Hague Juno 15. The special
court would decide whether under the
Prussian-American treaty "tho bellig
erent contracting party is prevented
from sinking merchant vessels of the
neutral contracting party tor carrying
contraband when such sinking Is per
missible, according to the general
principles of international law."
The United States has contended
that the German cruiser Prinz Eitel
Friedrich had no right under the troa
ty to sink tho Frye. Tho German note
proposes that both parties present
copies of their argument to the court
on March 1 and deposit tholr countor
cases and evidence on May 1.

BURGLARS FAIL
Second Visit to Penn's Grove

Officers and Inspectors.
DU PONT PAY DAY
Gang Expects to Make Big
Haul, But Posse Closes
In Too Soon.
Penn's Grove, N. J Jan. 8. A gang
of six or seven burglars attempted to

county jail after a 'fight with a posse
of citizens, policemen and postal In
spectors None of the wounded men
Is seriously injured
All of the burglars were heavily
armed, but none of the posse was
struck.
Because of the great Increase In the
number of employes at the Du Pont
powder works at Carney's Point, N.
J , the Penn's Grove postoffice is a
busy place. On pay day at the povd
er plant two weeks ago an attempt
was made to rob the postoffice. Yes
terday, which was again pay day, an
other visit from the robbers was an
ticipated. Chief Mashal Harbeson of
Penn's Grove enlisted the service of
half a dozen citizens to help his force
of four policemen and postal officials
sent four Inspectors. All were arm
ed. The postoffice was surrounded at
midnight and at 2: GO a. m. the robbers
entered the building leaving one man
outside as lookout. Soon afterward
the posse closed in on the postoffice
and the lookout opened fire. Instantly
his accomplices appeared at doors and
windows and started shooting, tho
posse returning the fire vigorously.
Three of tho burglars were wounded.
Two others were arrested later.
GREEK CAPTAIN
PRAISES CREW
Behavior of Men So Heroic
That Hope of Saving Steam
er Was Sustained Until
Last Moment. '
SHIP BADLY STRAINED
Sailors Work in Swirling Wat

Keep Engines and Pumps
Working.
New York, Jan. 8. The story of how
the crow of the Greek steamer Thessa
lonlki before abandoning the vessel on
January 5 worked for ten days in from
three to four foot of Tvator in a despe
rate effort to keep steam in tho ship's
boilers and work tho pumps, "was told
today when Captain Goulandris and

Schooner Mana and Captain Harry Gillam.
With mileage behind her equal to twice around the world, and with
.three years' seafaring since she left Southampton for the South Seas, the
schooner Mana, Captain Harry Gillam, arrived in San Francisco last week
bearing as cargo many crates and boxes containing skulls and other grew
some remains of former residents of Easter Island, in the South Pacific
.The skulls are bound for the British Museum.
1
havior of his men was so heroic that
he did not give up hope of bringing
tho Thessaloniki into New York until
the coal supply was entirely exhausted
on January 5. He declined to com
ment upon statements made by some
of the Thessalonlki's 177 passengers,
when they arrived here yesterday on
the Patris, that he had refused to send
out wireless calls for assistance after
the steamer had sprung several leaks.
Ship Half Full of Water.
The Thessaloniki was half full of
water when abandoned at latitude
33.33 north; longitude GG.20 west, Cap
tain Goulandris said, and he believed
the vessel, the first he ever command
ed, had sunk soon after ho and his
men boarded the Perugia. He added
that the Thessaloniki was badly
strained by the series of storms she en
countered almost from tbe time tho
ship passed Gibraltar on December 17
Therefore, when a hurricane was en
countered late in December, several
plates were opened and the boiler and
engine rooms wero partly flooded.
It was then that all the crew turned
to, and despite tho water that swirled
about them, worked constantly at the
boilers, engines and pumps.
During much of this time there was
an acute shortage of water and food
on tho disabled vessel. For several
days only one-half cup of water was
allowed each man and the rations con
sisted of stale bread and a few vege
tables. The Pemgia brought 27 sacks
of mail removed from the Thessaloniki.

the foundation of a definite military
policy. "It makes no difference now
whether we have a little or much

Need Compulsory System.
The secretary said that unquestion
able any perfect military system must
be based on compulsory service. Many
army officers, in his opinion, viewed
the continental army plan as a final
test of the volunteer army system,
doomed to failure, but valuable as a
direct step toward some form of uni
versal military sence.
Asked -what steps had been taken
toward working out a system of or
ganizing railroads and commercial en
terprises for the military emergencies,
Mr. Garrison said a careful study of
the subject was now 'being made by
his order nnd had been In progress for
some months. Plans for tentative con
tracts for war munitions to become ef

for tho assembling of equipment to

Youngstown, O., Jan- 8. Answering H
an appeal from citizens of Struthers,

militia to that village for protection jH
from rioting there. The message stat- J IH
ed that a mob has formed and is en-

H
Several hundred citizens of Struth- H
ers, across the Mahoning river oppo- H

selves today and massed on a bridge H
to repel a threatened, invasion of H
strikers. Fifty pounds of dynamite H
was -placed beneath the bridge and an H
electrical connection made ready to

across. H
Later reports said that the situation H

YoungBtown Sheet and Tube company, IH
Brigadier General John C. Speaks or-' - H
dered four Cleveland militia conipa- H
nies of the fifth regiment to the strike H
scene. Two companies marched into M
the plant to reinforce 100 strike H
guards, and the other two companies IH
patrolled opposite the hill to prevent IH
mob organizing. Operations at the mill H
are entirely suspended today and no H
attempts was made to operate it. H
" Three hundred office employes are H

Youngstown, Ohio, Jan. S. With , H
three regiments of the Ohio national H
guard under command of Brigadier H
General John C. Speaks patrolling the H
smouldering ruins of the village of H
East Youngstown or encamped in the H
mills nearby, the civic and military IH
authorities here expressed the belief H
that, for the present at least, an end H
has been put to the wild scenes of H
rioting and looting which marked last M
night and left the thriving little city M
a mass of embers. One life Is known H
to have been lost, fully ten blocks of H
the town, including the entire business , H
section, were burned and several H
thousands of people were driven from M
their homes and the loss was placed I H
at no less than $1,000,000. I
Physicians who were called to look J M
after the wounded placed tho number M
at 100, although only fifteen had been M
brought to hospitals here. While the I H
majority had been shot, there were JM
many wounds from knives. H
AM Saloons Closed. H
There was no liquor question to ! M
settle in East Youngstown today, for M
of the twenty saloons all but two had
been burned and those two had beeu j M
looted.
By two o'clock this morning more H
than a hundred had been rounded, up j H
and brought here while tho little po- jH
lice station in East Youngstown was i M
filled to overflowing. The Majority M
of the men taken were nrmed and H
many of them wero under the influ- i jH
ence of liquor. j H
Clearing the streets gave tne ' m
Youngstown fire department an oppor- j M
tunity to get into East Youngstown j M
and men and equipment were rushed j H
to the village. There was still some I jH
work for them to do and water was , H
thrown on the ruins the rest of tho j H
night, but the wreck wrought by the H
mob was almost complete. By day- I 11
break the walls of many of the brick I IH
buildings burned began to fall and H
the principal streets were roped off M
and sightseers excluded H
What became of the mob when it i M
