Rioting that made the night one of
horrors started shortly after G o'clock
last night when a few employes of the
'Sheet and Tube Company, who had been
rushed Into the plant on freight cars,
were quitting work. Two thousand as
sembled strikers jeered them.
'A blank shot, which Chief J. M. Woltz,
head of the company's police force, said
he fired, started the trouble. Strikers,
armed with dirks and revolvers, at
tacked the plant and fired the two-story
office building and storehouse.
Then the strikers moved on the bus

town of 10,000. Several saloons were'

AMSTERDAM, Jan. 8. The Ford peace

Several ot the Ford lenders- said the
friendliness with which the party was
received emphasized Germany's desire

The reception accorded the peace pil
grims by German officers during the

received since their arrival In Europe.
The officer who superintended the en
training at Warnemunde. on the Danish
frontier yesterday, conversed pleasantly
with several members of the party.
"Don't take peace back to America
with you," was his parting statement.
"It is needed here.;
The German officer In charge of the

ELECTRIC FIRM THE BUYER
Yet Nothing Has Been Found

By S. M. REYNOLDS.
The Potomac Electric Power Com
pany enjoys a monopoly of the electric
light and power business over the
most profitable territory of Washington
partly because of the fact that public
thought In recent years has tended to
ward the belief that the Interests of a
large community are beat served where
there is a consolidation of management
over each of the various classes of pub
lic utilities rather than competition.
Theoretically, the public has been
taught to believe, the best and the most
economical kind of electric light and
power service, or street railway service,
or- gas lighting service. Is that wherein
there Is no expensive duplications of
plant and consequnt doubling up of
costs. Hut In accepting this view, and
permitting pubic service corporations
to enloy more or less complete mo
nopolles In their respective fields, the
public has been led to believe that.
favored In this way, these corporations
can and will adopt methods of opera
tlon which will enable them to give
better service at less cost. That Is
why the public of Washington on the!
general proposition has, favored, rather !
than opposed, the. Idea of a consollda-

How Germany Meets
Demands of America
"Until the decision of the perm
anent court of arbitration, the
German naval forces will sink
only such American vessel as
are loaded with nosolute con
traband, When the precondi
tions provided by the dcclara
. tion of London are present. In
this the German government
quite shares the view of the
American Government that all
possible care must be taken
i for the security of tho crew
and passengers of a vessel to
be sunk. Consequently, the
persons found on board of a
vessel mar not be ordered into
her lifeboats except when the
general conditions, that is to
say, the wcother, the condition
of the sea, and the neighbor
hood of the coasts afford ab
solute certainty that the boats
will reach the nearest port.
For the rest the German gov
ernment begs to point out that
in cases where German naval
forces have sunk neutral ves
sels for carrying contraband,
no Iobs of life has yet occurred.

TERRUL 1ITES HE
IS
Young Washingtonian Solves
Mystery of ,His Disappear
ance "Cut Loose."
William Prescott Terrell solved the
mystery of his own disappearance to
day. Shortly aftef noon his family re
ceived a letter from him mailed yester-
da in Norfolk. It informed his parents
that ydung Terrell "thought he would
cut loose for a while."
The arrival of the letter brought to a
sudden termination the exhustive search
which the police, the Central Detective
Office, the Boy Scouts and the con
stables of nearby Maryland have been
conducting since Monday, when the
young man left the 'office of his father.
WlUlam M. Terrell, of the real estate
llrm of Terrell & Little, to disappear, ap
parently. "Into thin air,
Just a'oou't -the time when the TetUr
icached. his relatives the police were
considering dragging the Tidal Basin,
In the fear that he Tiad met death there.
In the light of the letter the police
are Inclined to believe that young Ter
rell possibly left home In search of
material for his sociological researches
In which he was Intensely Interested.
They have been told that he was writ
ing a book along such lines and that
Its completion had been delayed for
want of more material.
While Terrell waa making hla way to
Norfolk, and while the letter was com
ing back here, ono of the most exhaus
tive searches which has ever been made
for a missing man in this city was
afloat. Yesterday Detective Evans spent
the entire day in a high-powered car
covering half a ecore of towns In Mary
land within a radius of ISO miles of
thl selty.
At least a dozrn possible clues which
the police thought creditable were found
and between the time he left the city
and the time the myster yof his dls
appearaonce was solved, no less than
half a dozen reputable witnesses had
seen and talked to young men, who,
fro mthe description Klven. mlstit have
j Deen young Terrell
The faqt that all of the witnesses
agreed that the young man they saw
was making a northeasterly course
through Maryland served to mislead the
police.
The young man's father frankly ad
mitted that he feared the worst when
he called at police headquarters short
ly after noon today and suggested that
a search of the Tidal Basin might be
advisable, because a friend of Prescott'a
had seen him near there Monday or
Tuesday nlcht. He had not been gone
from police headquarters more than
half an hour when word came that the
oter had been received at his residence.
President Gompers Places Foun

Berore many men prominent In the

Other Concessions by Central
, Powers Gives Hope of Set
tlement of Submarine,Trou:
bles, But Crisis Not Passed.
The United States has for
mally protested to Great Brit
ain against mail seizures on
steamers touching the British
Isles. The note will be given
out by Secretary Lansing in the
next few days.
jSecretary of State Lansin'g to
day made public the reply of the
German government in the nego
tiations for settlement of damages
arising from the sinking of the
American steamer William F. Frye
by the German commerce raider
Prinz Eitel Friedrich.
In this note Germany accedes
in the main to the contention of
the United States that placing per
sons in small, boats, under all con
ditions, "is not sufficient security"
for crew and -passengers of "a
vessel to be sunt.''
This coming on the heels of
written assurances from the Ger
man government that Germany
will observe international law in
Mediterranean submarine activi
ties, will investigate the Persia
disaster, and give reparation if at
fault, and will pay indemnity to
Americans lost on the Lusitania,
officials considered that important
concessions had been made to the
United States in the submarine
controversy.
READ BETWEEN LINES.
It is not altogether what la contained
in these communications that encour
ages officials to believe the central
powers will meet in full the demands
of the United States respecting sub
marine warfare, but lt Is what is writ
ten between the lines and the added as
surances given confidentially to this
government.
Germany Is considered to have made
most important concessions to meet the
United States viewpoint; Austria has
given practically the same assurances,
and Washington has been assured that
Turkey and Bulgaria will be guided in
future operations by assurances given
by Its more important allies.
But officials are not optimistic enough
to give the Impression that these as
surances settle the submarine question.
Germany made promises after the Lusi
tania disaster, and broke them in the
Arabic sinking, officials point1 out; Aus
tria repeated these assurances in the
Ancona note, and to held guitty on clr
cumstanital evidence of the Persia sink
ing and other submarine attacks In the
Mediterranean.
The German government's promise,
added to that given by Austria, to make
a full inveslgatlon of the Persia case,
and make reparation and punish the
submarine commander if at fault, gives
official grounds for hope that the Persia
case will be cleared up, but that case
remains to be aetUed.
Concessions In Frye Note.
In the Frye note made public today
Germany agrees that passengers ami
crews shall be placed in lifeboats ne
fore sinking a vessel carrying conn it
band only when the sea and weatner
conditions and pVoxlmlty to land maae.
It certain that all boats will reacu
shore safely.
The proposal of the United States
that the two experts 'to fix damages
for sinking the ' Frye should meet in
the United States is rejected, owinc
to dangers the German export wouui
court in attempUng to reach here. The
proposal of an umpire to settle dif
ferences if the two experts are. unable
to agree also Is rejected, because uer
mtiny is unwilling to leave trvft ques
tion of principal Involved to an um
pire, but holds any disagreement shouin
b settled by diplomatic Interchange.
The United States has not insisted
strongly on these two points, being
