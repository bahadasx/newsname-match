New Year's Thoughts.
The Farmers Raised Wonderful Crops Last Year.The
Money in the Banks.-Who Holds Deposit Slips?
The marked diversity of Mis
souri crops and the wonderful ni
rlcidtural resources of the state is
strlkinl.v shown in the annual CPOJ
report issued from the State
Board of Agriculture. This Chris
mns letter from the secretary of
agriculture shown that, despite
losses from excessive rainfall and
overflows, the state will this year
have nsantn C'laus stocking filled
with the equivalent of 1210,818,
S4r. These figures and it is wor
thy of note that they nre not
boom figures, for large deductions
have been made for IosjM s hcludfl
only the ordinary field crops. The
millions of barrels of npppUs. and
hundreds of car-loads of peaches,
strawberries and other fruits nre
not included. Nor nre- poultry pro
ducts valued at. perhaps. s.'f'.OOO -000.
made a part of the estimate
Dairy Apiary and timber product!
urc likewise omitted, as is blue
grass, of Which Missouri has hun
dreds of acres. Nor is the value
of Missouri live stock Incorporat
ed in the report.
The above was a Christinas
letter" sent out by the Missouri
Agricultural Department to show
how prosperous we are. Truly it
is a wonderful Mowing. And if
wo accept it Without analy sis, we
might imagine that all of us had
a bank account to draw upon
especially the farmer.
The farmers in their fields have
alone produced over two hundred
and nineteen million dollars. The
total population of the state is
8,208,88a One-third of these
live In the three large cities of
Bt. Louis. Kansas City and St. -lo-teph,
They don't farm. At least
another third live In the smaller
Cities and towns. They don't farm
Hence we'have left about a third
of the population on the farm. 1
think you will agree that this is
a fair division of population.
This means that the farmers of
Missouri have produced, during
the year just closed, about 866.50
for every man. woman and child
in the state, white, black or yel
low, in prison or out. Assuming
that the average farm family has
six members, it means that the
farmers of Missouri have produc
ed for themselves about 81,200
ikt family IN GRAIN AND HAY
i
Now listen! The department
tdls us that this does not Include
the millions of barrels of apples,
peaches, berries and so on Nor
.iocs it include live stock nor the
products of the COW and hen. Xor
does it include the ''garden tr ek 1
and other products that the far
mer's family consume themselves
Now. if we add these thing
that the department says are nol
Included in its report, don't you
believe that it would push the
product of the average farm fam
ily up to atjout 82,000?
If so. where is yours? Who sot
all above your scant living? The
fanner produced the wealth, and
the money that represents it is
n the banks. Do you hold the cer
tificates of deposit? Or is the ac
count carried In the name of the
highly polished gentlemen who
'"arm the farmer?
According to the official manual
just issued by the secretary of
state, there are farms In
the state containing an average
of 124 acres pei- farm I:. a re
cent Issue the Kicker am: mneed
the discovery of the National Ag
ricultural department that farm
ing on a smal scale did not pay.
Lud Allen l.. Benson pointed out
that it was the high price of land
that is destroying agricultural
life and forcing the farmer's suns
and daughters to the Industrial
i enters to become wage-slaves
He also showed that it was the
same inflated land values that
produced tenantry.
For land to have a high value is
not beneficial to the one who uses
it. even though he be the owner.
It only increases his taxes. If
the user be a tenant, he must not
o.iy dig out the taxes and re
pairs, but interest on the inflated
alue as well.
While the increase in the farm
acreage in Missouri from 1000 to
1010 was very slight, yet the
value of 'l he land more than dou
bled during those ten years. This
ivas good for the speculator, but
hard on those who till the soil.
Land values are entirely specu
lativefictitious. There is no
more reason for fixing a money
value on land than there is for
fixing a money value on air or
water. AH are gifts of nature to
mankind, and no man, or set of
men, lias any moral or natural
right to draw incomes from let
ting the use of either yet they
have a legal right because of the
man-made laws.
The land should be for ttiose
who want to use it, and not for
those who, through corrupt leg
islation, seek to deprive the mas
ses of a home and thereby make
the majority of people pay for
the privilege of living on Hod's
earth.
This system of land monopoly
comes to us from feudal times,
when some successful warrior
butcher would be "anointed'' king
by some "holy" faker to rule by
"divine right" and this "divine
right" king would distribute the
land among his favorites called
dukes, earls, and so on, and the
great mass of people could live
only on the terms dictated by
these. Today we have exactly
the same Conditions, except that
the system lias been glossed over
and trimmed UO a little.
Today the majority of us "free
born American citizens' have no
place we can call home, and we
can remain here only by paying
somebody for the privilege. This
is not because some are more lazy
than others for the laziest of the
working class does more useful
work than. John D. Rockefeller Si-,
or Jr.
The trouble lies in the system
of production and distribution,
mi l I have been tr, Ing to find out
why the editors in the lower
counties don't explain to the re
volting tenants what is wrong.
I am about convinced that the
reason the editors don't explain
is because they are as ignorant of
the cause as the tenants them
selves The only paper that has
attempted a Stagger at explain
ing is the Pemiscot Argus Mv
goofi neighbor gets off this
"We are not familiar with the
relationship which exists in tint
county between the landlord and
his tenant, but do not believe that
the latter has been treated so
badly as to excuse his taking up
the torch or the gun to attack
the former. Whatever wrongs the
tenant may be foived to endure,
we doubt if lie is he'd in peonage,
and if he is not. he has the privi
lege of moving to other places
more favorable to him. if he is
dissatisfied,"
Nobody is going to disagree
with Bro AveriH on the above
Out he doesn't give us much light
He tells us that the tenant has
the privilege of moving to other
places "more favorable", but fur
gets to tell us where the "more
favorable" places may be found
Surely the tenant does not know,
nnd. being an educator and de
fender of the existing order. Bro
AveriH should tell him. By-the-way,
Bro, Averlll, there are no
saloons in either NewMadrid or
Dunklin counties How do you ac
count for it that the jails are so
crowded that the jails of neigh
boring counties had to lx' pressed
into service? Ore. AveriH foe on!
"We are l.ot condemning the
tenant and upholding the land
lord aeaclasi but w dosaythnt
the tenants cannot bring about
any changes In their favor by
the use of violence towards those
who are their landlords or theli
employers, There should be some
common ground on which thej
could mee't wit!, fairness and s
tice towards each other, but that
can never be discovered while an
gry passions rule either side.
That a'so sounds pood but has
no meaning. It would be interest
ing to have Bro. Averlll sug
gest 'some common ground" on
which the landlord and tenant
might meet "with fairness and
justice." I fear he would find it
about as easy ;,s to suggest simi
lar conditions for the highway
man and hi victim.
Legally, the taking of part or
the crop from the tenant for the
use of the soil is all right !".'. it
will not stand any other t"t
This alleged right comes to us
from savagery, when the strong
eat tribe he'd the land TlH In
dians practiced it at the time
when this country was discovered
by the "civilized Christians" whoi
took the land from the Indians.
Out the savage tribes were much
more humane and Just than th
their conquerors. No member of
a poss sslng tribe had any more
right to any part of the soil than
had any other member. They he'd
it as common property, it re
mained for feudalism, and then
capitalism, to say that the land
should be only for the few, i ml
that the many must pay trlb ite
The landlord, like any othei
capitalist, is willing to meet the
worker on any sort of "common
ground" that will not dump hi 11
off the w orker s back. The politi
cians and their organs are aiwa;
GOING to do something or th 1
working class, and tell them t(
ott? fortius or that humbug and
all will be well.
Mr. Wilson and the Democratic
party were sure QOING to fix it
A "New Freedom" was promised,
and we were given regional bank
and a war tax iu time of peace.
Also some "tariff reform." Now
we are promised nione war tax.
more tariff reform spiced with
farm credits and land banks just
as if more taxes and getting deep
er ba debt is what the farmers
need to make them happy.
All of these schemes are worse
thun bunc and are intended only
to fool and quiet a restless peo
ple. The present land system is
as old as robbery itself, and must
give way as soon as a majorfty
of the people understand it. And
it is the education of the masses
that they who are in ttie saddle
fear and combat. He who tries
to enlighten the oppressed ia, of
course, a very undesirable citizen
a demagogue and disturber.
But the light is beginning to
shine. The modern idea is based
upon Justice and will prevail, it
Is based upon the natural right of
all to the usl of the soil. The
land should le the common prop
erty of the statethe people, The
state should be- the only landlord.
Occupation and use should be a
necessary qualification te exer
cise ownership or control. No one
should bo permitted to exercise
ownership over land ha does not
himself occupy und use.
And how easy It would be to
bring this about. The state now
holds the prior title to all land,
and if you or I think we nre the
absolute owners of a piece of land
we have another guess coming,
We arc Just tenants, and so lorn
as we pay the annual rent, called
taxes, the state will not disturb
our possession. But if we fall, the
state takes the lane! and lets l
to one who Will pay.
.Such an arrangement Is not so
bad, Out. as the result of man
made laws, a second tax collector
has wormed himself in and fas
tened himself on the backs of the
landless farmers who are so un
fortunate as to lie1 unable to deal
directly With the state. This sec
ond and entirely useless tax-collector
Is the landlord He deals
in land as in merchandise, and the
higher he can force the price, the
greater his exactions from those
who must use the land In order to
live. As In other speculation, he
demands "Interest on the lncs
ment and then some.
Hence, when land values are on
ly $80 per acre he Will demand
only one-third as much rent as
when the same land sells for 800
Yet the land will produce no more
These same landlords and their
flunkies will tell you that the So
cialists want to confiscate your
farms." What a grim Joke! Who
or what Is it that has caused the
"confiscation" of the homes of a
majority of the people of this na
tion? Could Socialists do worse'
Then they tell you that the So
cialists want to break up your
home. Who or what Is it that
has made more than half our peo
ple homeless? Then look at Eu
rope and see what capitalism is
doing for the homes there.
There is absolutely no defend
Ing the existing order, and only
the fool or hypocrite Will trj
And even then the best thej can
do is to try to look wise and
yawp about "law und order."
There can te no absolute priv
ate title to land. All private ti
tles, whether called fee simple or
otherwise, are and must be subor
dinate to the public title. The
Socialist Party tries to prevent
land from being i:ed for the pur
pose of exploitation and specula
tlon. It demands the collective
possession, control or manage
meat of land to whatever extent
may be necessary to attain that
end. It Is not opposed to oceupa
tion and possession of land by
these using it iu a useful and
bona fide manner without ex
ploitation. Land Plank from the
National Socialist platform.

a big estate passes, but some of

all tlu shameful n s ilt, let us look
at it In another light.

Into cultivation an acre of it The
work of making the land produc
tive was done by poor people who
lived in the most abject poverty
They cleared the land and then
cultivated it and it was THEIli
labor that paid for the land It
was their labor that made the
." land worth t.
Out when1 are these laborers

No wonder, then that an agi

weeks ago for "preaching Christ"
on the streets of that landlord
