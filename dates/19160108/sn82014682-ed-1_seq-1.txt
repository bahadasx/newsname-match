Municipal finance high or low. ac
cording to the way you look at it--has
brought the supervisors Into the
beginning of the year 1916 with an
"overdraft" of nearly $150,000.
City officials skilled in forecasting
revenues estimate that the receipt of
the municipality for 1916 will not ln-
. . v. n iam hv more
Crease over iuuis vi j
than i:O.Oeo.:.The'cofl8eo.ence is;
cording to the figures of recora in
the auditor's-bffice, that $120,000 or so
of this over-appropriation of 1915 will
have to he met by a corresponding
reduction in the amount available for
" 1916 improvements, additions to
equipment and other city expenses.
Figures at the auditor's office yes
terday showed that the supervisors
actually spent In 1915 $82,997.52 more
ban the city receipts amounted to.
In addition to this, they appropriated
in 1915 $64,319.72. This, like the pre
ceding $80,000, must be met out of the
1916 revenues. ' It rolls up the stag
gering total of $147,317.24. :
This is In the general " fund alone.
The permanent improvement fund is
also over-appropriated by more than
$7000. By law the road tax and school
funds cannot be thus over-appropriated
so that they are not mortgaged for
the future. . .

JUDGE ASHF0RD SCENTS
- PERJURY IN TESTIMONY
;.v. . .
Bringing to a partial close the fight
which the city attorney's department
for the last several weeks has been
waging in an endeavor to break up an
alleged "loan shark" ring, John VJvi
chaves, E. Markle, W. L. Peterson und
W. E. Wayman, convicted of usury,
were sentenced this. morning by Cir
cuit Judge Ash ford. In. the cases of,
Vivichaves and Peterson, but little le
niency was shown by the court. In
the other cases Judge Ashford ' was
Inclined to go more lightly In the mat
ter of sentence. - ' '

the 14 original charges of; . usuryk pre

suited ' to convictions. ' He; pieauea
guilty to the - third. On the lirst
charge Judge Ashford sentenced um
to serve four, months in the ity Jail
and pay the costs of the court. '.
Hit Fines Total $500. ;
On the second he was sentenced to
pay a fine of $250 and costs, a similar
penalty being inflicted on the third
charge. In casi Vivichaves does not
pay the fines, he .'will have to serve
500 days in jail in addition to the four
months. The other charges were nolle
prossei at the instance of Deputy At
torney Will T. Carden. - V .
Judce Ashford said that he was con
vinced that, during . the trial of his
cases, Vivichaves had committed de
liberate perjury. ' You have shown
absolutely no claim to the merciful
consideration of the court," the Judge
added.--.. r - '
'Attorney J. A. liagoon. counsel for
Vivichaves, mad a long address to
the court in which "he stated that he
thought the penalty imposed on Vivi
chaves was a miscarriage of justice.
Peterson, when called up for sen
tence, said that he was not guilty 'is
far as his conscience was concerned.
Attorney Carden said that, in the
opinion of the prosecution, Peterson
was far more dangerous to the com
munity than was Vivichaves. Judge
Ashford sentenced Peterson to serve
three months in the city Jail and pay
the costs of the court A motion for
a new trial has been filed in the Peter
son case, and it is understood that,
before very long, the matter will be
taken to the supreme court ; j
Prior to his being sentenced on two
charges of usury, to which he had
pleaded guilty, W. E. Wayman made
a long statement to the court in which
he declared that he had borrowed
money to loan it to -another person,
the latter having reloaned VC and di
vided up the high interest proceeds
wh him. H urped that he be given
a fine, and not a prison sentence. The
court fined him $150 and costs on the
first charge and one dollar on the
second charge.
E. Markle. a motorman with the
Rapid Transit and who was a witness
for the prosecution during the trial of
the Peterson case, was fined $125 and
cCsts. - '' -"' '
Esjeclally In the trials of Peter
son and: Vivichaves, testimony was
brought but regarding the methods
used by the "loan sharks" in their
transactions. In one instance, a man
was loaned $100 fcr three months and
was charged interest to the amount
of $40. ,
That perjury was committed by both
Vivichaves and Peterson during their
trials is the stated belief of the prose

taken toward an investigation In this
respect

existing figures, must be made up out
of the 19 IS revenues.
Figures at the auditor's office also
reveal that the collection of license
