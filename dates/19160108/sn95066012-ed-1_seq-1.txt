Companies' Property.
Kasi Youngstown, O., Jan. 8. Com
parative quii-t exists here today bo
cause of the presenile of 22110 state
troops. It Is estimated that the
strikers have destroyed at least a
million dollars worth of property.
Youncstown. O.. Saturday, Jan. 8.
Three men are dead, nineteen persons
including two women, have been shot
down, half of East Youngstown is in
flames, as a result of strlUe riots last
night. Six thousand men are running
wild burning and looting. Fire loss
at midnight had reached JSuu.Ono.
Two companies of United States
regular troops from Columbus late
last night were ordered into Kast
Youngstown following the burning
and looting of the post ollice. Two
regiments of Ohio national guard al
ready were on the scene. A third is
reported cn its way.
The bridge from Kast Youugstown
to Struthers had been "burned to pre
vent the rioters entering that town.
Houses in Youngstown had been dyn
amited by the rioters who were bent
on destroying the residence section.
At 11 o'clock the mob was in abso
lute coutrol of Kast Youngstown.
very one of the eighteen saloons in
the district had been raided; their
doors aud windows knocked in so that
if a striker wanted drink all he had
to do was to go In and get it.
The trouble was the culmination oi
strike of laborbi'3 which beg:m at
the plant of the Republic, Iron and
Steel company a week ago and spread
to the plants of the Tube company,
the Y'oungstcwn Iron and Steel com
pany, and the lirier Hills Steel com
pany, all independent concerns.
The men demand twenty-cents an
hour; the companies offer an increase
of from nineteen and one-half cents
to twenty-two cents.
The most serious trouble started
last night when the day shift at the
Siieet and Tube mills left work.
A crowd cf ti.OOO gathered at the en
trance of the works and stoned a
squad of private police in charge of
Chief J. M. Woltz of the Sheet and
Tube company force.
According to a statement made 1y
Woltz, he fired a blank shot to scare
the crowd and then firing became gen
eral. Nineteen in the crowd were
wounded, after which the mob, frenz
ied, surged into the East Youngstown
business district and set fire to sev
eral buildingR.
As the torch was applied first to a
clothing store and then to a jewelry
store, the- looting began. A saloon
was fired and looted, the liquor be
ing distributed through the crowd.
Fire departments went to the scene
of the fires, but were fired on and driv
en off by the crowd. The fire at a
late hour still was beyond control.
Many families were burned out.
In the afternoon Sheriff Umstead
found the situation beyond his control
and asked that state troops bo sent
here. Governor Willis ordered the
Fifth relment with headquarters at
Cleveland, and the Eighth regiment,
with headquarters at Ducyrus. to this
city. The Fourth regiment at Colum
bus was ordered to mobilize and move
to the scene of the trouble as scon as
possible.
The men killed have not been iden
tified. One. was fatally shot while at
tempting to loot a store in East
Youngstown. Some one tirude the
store fired the shot.

the local five suffered defeat for the

The game wr.s one of the roughest
that has been witnessed in Benniug
ton in years. Tho W'aterford boys
outweighed the Bennington students
and used this advantage in an unfair
and unnecessary manner as they
could have won In a gcnilenr'.nly
game. Harwond of the Bennington
team was temporarily knocked out
and Burt has a s ruined ankle that
will confine him to the house for a
number of days. At the close cf the
game one of the W'aierforil boys at

How on the Bessarablan front is con
veyed by Petrop'ad, dispatches today,
which state that tho Rintians for fifty
hours concentrated! 400 guns on lire
Austrian positions jr Czernowitz as
a preparation for ai.. V'antry attack.
The Russian communin lions do not
claim that Czernowitz has fallen, but
disnatches from German sources ad
mit their position there is critical.
It is not yet clear whether the Ku
sian operations in tuis theatre herald
a ireneral offensive by all the Russian
armies from the Baltic sea to the Ru
manhm border, tr indicate merely a
diversion of unparalleled magnitude
and fierceness deslpued to weaken
the pressure of the central powers in
tlu Balkans and incidentally on tae
Italan front.
Tins lighting has been of the most
bitter character, according to both
the Austrian and Russian reports.
Few prisoners are being taken and
the infantry enga'-'C'L-uts are largely
in the nature of bar 1-to-hand encoun
ters.
All the Russian operations thus far
revealed arc neing pressed aioug iu
railway lines, which simplify the proh

ammunition and fuel.
In their operations a,:ainst Czerno

ITALIAN STEAMER ARMED-
Passenger Steamer Had Guns Mount
ed Fore and Aft.
Washington, Jan. 0. The state de
partment probauly vi.l take up wui
the Italian government I lie question
of f.uns mounted on the liner Giusep
pe Yeri'.l. which readied New York
today, with a view fo having the
pieces dismounted before the ship
Raves American waters.
The guns on the Verdi promise- to
bring up again a point which lias-bean
disputed since the war began. At the
outset of hostilities the I'nited States
took tho position that ships entering
American ports witli guns of not more
than six inches caliber, mounted aTi
for purposes of defense, would not
be considered armed, but reserved
the right to change its position in the
light of changing con'iitions of war
fare and the introduction of new' ele
lnenis such as the submarine cam
paign.
The slate department later had in
formal negotiations with Great Brit-
am ami Franco inrougn rneir am
bassadors here and asked that any
:-;;ms wliatever do renioveu rrom u;o
big passenger liners coming; into
American ports. The two govern
ments informally, and also reserving
their rights, complied.
Since the question of guns on the
British liner Persia ira.i arisen the
point lias been brought up again, but
Secretary Lansing has declined to an
nounce any position ami has let. it bt-
known that ho would not be committ
ed.
State department oflicials ex
pressed the view today that tho Ital
ian government would probably he
asked informally to dismounl the
guns on the Verdi before It sails from
the United States.
The state department was without
official advices, but the news dis
patches telling of the presence of
Itnliun naval gunners on (lie Verdi set
oflicials to reviewing the authorities
and precedents to determine whether
tho ship might not lie classed as an
auxiliary cruiser.

For Rheumatism
As soon ns an attack of Rheuma
lism begins apply Sloan's Liniment.
Don't waste time and suffer unneces
sary agony. A few drop3 of Sloan's
Liniment on tho affected parts is all
you need. Tho pain goes at once.
A grateful suTferer writes: "I was
suffering for three weeks with Chro
nic Rheumatism and Sliff Neck, al
though I tried many medicines, they
failed. Fortunately I heard of
Sloan's Liniment and after using it
three or four days am up and well.
I am employed at the bljrgest depart
ment store in S. F. where they em
ploy from six to eight hundred
hands, and they surely will hear all
about Sloan's Liniment. II. U.
