"Wilson's Position Trying

t
SEES' HOPE FOR. THE FUTURE
Congressman Swagar Sherley In
his visit hero this past week dis
cussed with a representative of the
Kentucky Irish American the recent
article in these columns concerning
President Wilson's attiude -on the
European war and the Mexican
question. Congressman Sherley
pleads that the average citizen is
a little hasty in his judgment of the
Fresldent and that it must be taken
into, account that his position has
been a trying one, holding, so to
speak, the destinies of 90,000,000
people in his grasp and endeavoring
to keep them from being embroiled
in the present war. Congressman
Sherley also contends that President
"Wilson Is acting for tho best in our
dealings with Mexico and that he
believed that there would be an
improvement soon in the conditions
In that unhappy country.
The Kentucky Irish American
claimed that Wilson erred In ac
cepting the report of John LInd,
who was proven to be prejudiced
and biased In his report of condi
tions, and that It was a garbled one
taken from anti-Catholic literature.
Since this fact was exposed LInd
has never appeared in public llfo
nor has the President endeavored to
get a true report or accepted tho
statements of reliable authorities,
Protestant or Catholic, that priests
and nuns have been persecuted and
outraged. For this tho Catholic
people believe he Is justly entitled
to criticism. Ex-President Roosevelt
in an article In this month's Metro
politan calls attention to tho Presi
dent's Mexican policy and cites the
-.following:
I have before me as I write a
copy of a paper submitted to mo
byCuBhlngStotson,theSecretaryof,
the American Defense Society. It
is the carbon copy of tho official re
port of W. O. Jenkins, tho acting
United States Consular Agent at
Pueblo, Mexico. It describes tho
outrages committed on January 5,
1915, by the victorious Carranzlstas.
The final fight, in which they were
victorious over their antagonists, oc
curred In front of the consulate.
Mr. Jenkins went out and examined
the twenty-seven dead men left
after tho fight was over. He found
that many of these men had been
killed after they had been struck
down and were unable to move,
their heads having been blown open
or they having been stuck with
knives. The victorious Carranzlstas
forced their way into tho consulate;
took tho American officer and his
friends from the house, and threat
ened to shoot them. Finally they
were allowed to return. Next morn
ing, however, a crowd of thirty sol
diers again entered tho consulate,
took tho agent forth and threatened
to shoot him, and finally Imprisoned
him. Ho was released only by the
efforts of the British Consul, W. S.
Hardaker, Tho Consul goes on to
explain that Carranzlstas, Zapatistas
and Villistas are all alike. In the
report, after reciting the outrages
committed upon himself and upon
others, Jenkins asks why our Gov
ernment continues to allow muni
tions of war to be Bent to the Mexi
cans and to be used by them not
only In murdering each other wlth-
rvnt rnncn nr rnnsnn. Vnit In destroy
ing the lives of foreigners as well
and even In shooting tho representa
tives of bur own country? "It is a
cold-blooded traffic In men's lives
and nothing more; and I can not
possibly understand how It can bo
countenanced by our Government."
This question has not been an
swered. It can not be answered.
I have before me a letter from
J. A. Robertson, of Tennessee, de
scribing what was done In the
Monterey consulate; how the Consul
General was taken out of tho con
sulate; the consulato ransacked; the
whole house torn up, and tho
American men, women and children
who had come thither for safety
driven Into one room; while tho
American flag was torn down, In
describably outraged In tho public
square by Mexican soldiers, and
finally tied to a horso's tall and
dragged down the street. Ho names
various other localities where sim
ilar outrages on American officials
and citizens were perpetrated; while
tho condition of tho Spaniards was
avart wino. TTn Rnnrikn also of tho
prevalence of loathsomo Infectious
diseases in these bandit armies and
then dwells upon the fact that a
few days previously to tho date of
the letter, which was written No
vember 8, 1915. an army of these
Carranzlstas, whose repeated in
sults to American official repre
sentatives and outrages upon Ameri
can citizens have never been in any
way redressed, were permitted by
our administration to pass through
our territory from Texas to Arizona.
I have been shown photographs in
numerable of murdered Mexicans
and I have been shown many photo
graphs of American property that
had been wrecked, including a pho
tograph of a Red Cross train on
which the Carraaslstas fired -for sev
eral minutes with riftes and -ohlne
gua. I have myself seen one
.Apwrlsaa flax and eae Red Ores
flag which were torn down and
trampled on by Mexican soldiers, In
one case Carranzlstas, and then re
turned to tho owners with directions
to take them and show them to
President Wilson as a proof of how
little the Mexicans cared what the
American peopla did. A year ago
ta tho Metropolitan I published de
tailed accounts of outrage upon out
rage upon our citizens by men rep
resenting tho different factions; and
I had already published detailed ac
counts of the hideous atrocities
committed on nuns In 'Mexico. I
have seen many photographs of
Catholic churches In Mexico that
havo been subjected to almost un
namable Infamy and degradation.
The administration has now rec
ognized Caranza, after Insisting that
if. never would recognize him, and
after having refused with far less
justification to recognize Huerta.
The followers of Carranza have
dono worse. Carranza derided and
Insulted tho President. His ad
herents have committed every spe
cies of outrage on American citizens
and on tho American flag. But tho
administration sheltered itself be
hind the action of the Latin-American
States It has unwisely invited
in to do the duty which tho admin
istration Itself feared to undertake.
It bowed with abject submission to
the man who had defied It; and
then with servile eagerness served
him against his rivals. For a year
or two Gen. Villa was the favorlto
of the administration and his forces
were permitted to supply themselves
across our border with arms and
munitions. About soventy of our
soldiers have been killed or wound
ed on the Mexican border by the
Villistas and tho other bandits
whom they were fighting. The ad
ministration took no action to se
cure redress for tho killing of theso
soldiers. Its only action was to
send the Chief of Staff of tho United
States army to negotiate a treaty or
agreement with Villa, tho bandit
chief of tho band of murderers.
whereby this chief promised not to
kill any more American soldiers on
American territory. The promise
was not kopt. Most of theso acts
havo been committed slnco this
promise was made; and now Presi
dent Wilson has turned against
Villa In the Interest of Carranza.
He would not war on Villa to save
American soldiers from death; but
he eagerly wars on him in tho In
terest of another Mexican bandit
whose followers have also mur
dered Americans. One course of
action was just as infamous as the
other; and when I use the word
"Infamy" I use It deliberately as
the only word that can describe
with scientific accuracy the policy
of poltroonery that the representa
tives of this Government have now
tor five years put Into effect as re
gards Mexico and, above all, tho
policy that has obtained for nearly
three years.

Bish on-Elect Brossart Plans For
Colony Settlement in
Mountains. '
Hon. Jcro A. Sullivan Suggests
Founding Monastery in
Diocoso.J
WOULD ADVANCE AGRICULTURE
In the free mountains of Kentucky
refugees from war-ridden Belgium
are td find a haven, If plans made
by Bishop-elect Ferdinand Brossart,
of tho Covington diocese, aro suc
cessful. Monslgnor Brossart will
endeavor after the war to settle a
colony of Belgians In Eastern Ken
tucky, which Is Included In tho seo
over which ho holds Jurisdiction.
The opportunity may also be extend
ed to emigrants from other lands
which have been laid waste by war,
but the plan was principally de
signed to aid the Belgians. The
Bishop-elect has just received a let
ter from Rev. John B. DeVille, of St.
John Borchmans church, ChlcagOi
ill.
"I have just returned from Belgium
and was happy when I learned of
your well-deserved elevation to tho
episcopacy," writes the Chicago
priest. Inclosed was a clipping
from a New York newspaper, which
(old of his mission In Belgium. This
deeply interested tho Covington
Bishop, for It described how after
three months of labor the Chicago
priest had brought to tho United
States 300 Belgian men, women and
children. Tho refugees joined rela
tives In this country.
"Three huhdred Belgians saw to
day for tho first time tho Statue of
Liberty," said Father Do Ville.
"They all came from their stricken
country filled with love for generous
America, that has bounteously cared
for them In their hour of need, and
nope to And on Columbia's hospitable
Bhores the happiness that war has
robbed them of; they look Into the
future with calm serenity and trust
In. their land of adoption graying
Hint It tvinv novBp PTnurlpnrnj tho
mtonrJ unrl TnvnfrpH"nf "ti1nnrtv'"ertTl
filets, I stood in their midst as wo
passed tho symbol of freedom and I
saw their faces light up with en
thusiasm as I explained to them what
It meant. Among them aro sad
eyed men and women, tho llnes,of
whoso faces reveal recent and
poignant sorrows; there aro women
with infants in their arms, with lips
aqulver and eyes poignant with tears
as they think of tho loved husbands
whom they are soon to embrace.
Many children are alone and remem
oer their parents only vaguely."
The prelate was deeply touched
by Father De Villo's story. He also
reeclved a letter from Hon. J. A.
Sullivan, attorney nt Richmond, In
which ho sayBS
"I want to suggest to you and in
quire if St would not be wise if we
could not bring about the location
in our diocese of some of the Belgian
emigrants in tho present war. They
aro all good Catholics and good
people, and after tho close of this
great European, war thousands and
thousands of emigrants will come to
America, not only from Belgium,
Dut from Germany, Franco and other
countries, and most of them will bo
Catholic, I hope, and why not bring
about the location of some of theso
In our diocese, where land Is rich
and cheap? Eastern Kentucky has
an area of tho best coal fn the
United States and also very large."
Mr. Sullivan also suggests tbe
founding of a monastery In Eastern
Kentucky. "Some years ago," says
ao In the letter, "I went from Jack
eon to Hlndman, Knott county, over
the mountain roads. On that trip
1 was accompanied by Col. C. J. Lit
tle, of Jackson, who was my client
and who Is a Presbyterian, and by
Judge G. W. Oourley, of Beattyville,
who was my associate counsel. I
was very much impressed with tho
country, with the magnificence of
tho timber, virgin forests and with
the depths and extent of tho coal
area. Gourley is not a Catholic, but
nls heart Is In tho progress of East
ern Kentucky. Ho at length urged
upon mo the Importance of a Cath
olic church, another Gethsomano
similar to tho one in this diocese, in
the mountains of Kentucky. Ho
said they wanted priests there and
orothers who would not only teach
books, but teach the art of agri
culture In tho mountains, and to In
duce them to come there they could
easily give a largo area of timber
and coal lands to tho church for a
location. And Gourley very sensibly
said that if the church had a mon
astery in tho mountains they would
bave a foothold there they could not
otherwise acquire, and that the
church would havo a basis from
which to radiate Its Influence. He
aid that he contributed to the erec
tion of the Catholic church at
Beattyville, although a Protestant,
and that he would gladly assist in
securing the required gifts to bring
about the location of a monastery
(n the mountains of Eastern Ken
tucky. He said that the mountain
people did not need simply book
learning, bat needed instruction, in
the art of agriculture, grapes and
to on, and that the brotherhood
tould bring that to them better than
any other influeuos he knew, besides
Christianising the raonataine, tou
1 were certainly the choice of! the
orleatt of the clKwese ana Utr yeo-
pie generally," says Mr. Sullivan in
congratulating th, Bishop-elect on
his new office. L

PRESIDENTIAL
Race From Republican Stand
point Narrows Down to
Two Candidates.
Supreme Justice Hughes and
Ex-President Roosevelt
tho Contenders.
"Wilson Can Defeat Roosevelt
Rut Not Hughes the Con
sensus of Opinion.
LOGAN ROCK GIVEN HIGH HONOR
Newspaper critics and magazine
editors far and wide are now dis
cussing the coming Presidential cam
paign, and a review of tho Presi
dential timber, especially in the Re
publican party, is the order of tho
day. Tho same old story is told In
every article. First tho different
candidates are enumerated, EHhu
Root, of New York; John W.
Weeks, of Massachusetts; Theodore
Burton, of Ohio; Charles E.
Hughes, of New York; Philander C.
Knox, of Pennsylvania; Charles W.
Fairbanks, of Indiana; William E.
Borah, of Idaho, and last but not
least Theodore Roosevelt, of Oyster
Bay. Then a description of their
political strength Is given and what
assets they would have In the event
of receiving tho Republican nomin
ation. But after all is told the
chances for securing the Republican
nomination for President Is nar
rowed down to two, and those two
are Supremo Justice Hughes and ex-
Presldent Roosevelt. It is believed
that Hughes can capturo tho nomin
ation with a little effort on his part,
and It hardly seems probable that
any man will throw aside the op
portunity to' become tho first citizen
of our land. In the event that he
is sincere and docs not desire the
nomination then It is an absolute
certainty that the next Republican
Presidential nominee Is none other
than Rough Rider Teddy.
The Kentucky Irish American
was the first paper In this part of
the country to say that President
Wilson was not as strong as he
might be and that tho Democrats
should not confine their attentions
to him alono, but in the event of
growing opposition to Wilson the
party should.haye j resgrvocandl
aafefoarryth"e)ar'tyBbanner,and' Vice President Marshall, Senator
Oscar Underwood or Champ Clark
would be handy men to have around
In case tho S. O. S. call Is sent out.
The Hearst newspapers are now
fighting Wilson desperately and say
that without the Gorman-American
vote to aid Tammany Hall New
York would be lost, and this same
vote would defeat him in Indiana,
Illinois, Ohio and Missouri. Re
gardless of the source of this pre
diction, it must be taken into con
sideration and coupled with the big
Catholic vote in tho Eastern States,
which will be against Wilson be
cause of his recognition of Car
ranza. Democratic leaders can not
afford to be too hasty In this selec
tion. If Hughes receives the Re
publican nomination and makes
much of the Republican slogan,
"Back to prosperity," ho will defeat
Wilson simply because tho railroads
and large corporations will force
their employes into the Hughes
camp by another year's contlnuanco
of the hard times cry, shorter
hours, etc., though prosperity was
In evidence everywhere. This is
shown right hero when corporation
employes were working four dayB a
week, desplto tho fact that there
was plenty of business, simply to
embarrass a Democratic administra
tion. The selection of Logan N. Rock,
of Louisville, as Special Assistant
Attorney General, 13 pleasing to ins
many friends and associates in tho
Democratic party and It was an ab
ligatlon on tho part of the Stanley
administration to reward him for
his untiring work for Stanley and
the ticket before and after the
primary. Hero In Louisville Mr.
Rock Is well thought of by all fac
tions of tho party and his selection
Is Indeed a popular one. Another
selection this week was the reap
pointment of John V. McDermott as
Chief Engineer at the Frankfort
Capitol building, and all Louisville
Democracy rejoices, as those who
make frequent visits to the capital
would be lost If "Big John" was
not on tho scene to give them the
proverbial glad hand and welcome.
Ho was Indorsed by tho entire
Louisville delegation.
The Louisville and Jefferson
county representatives fared very
well in committee appointments this
week in the Lower House, special
honors falling to Mayzck O'Brien,
Will Duffy, Will Perry and "Billy"
Kuh. Representative Adam Spahn
Is also slated for something good,
as it is claimed tho Speaker owes
his election to Spahn's work, but
Judging from the Times every day
anything dono at Frankfort must bo
attributed to tho Second ward
statesman and many have grown to
think from tho Times writings that
the epidemic of grip, change in
weather, etc., must be laid at
Hpahn's door.
Speaking of the Second ward, the
General Council made a wjse selec
tion this week In electing Ben
Beckmann to fill the vacancy In tho
Board of Councllmen to succeed
Charles Mann, as the new Council
man Is certainly a favprite with the
Democratic voters in that district
and has long been a worker for the
party without recognition. Mr,
Beckmann .is President of the
Columbia Athletic Club and one of
our leading photographers.
In reference to a eard published
In another column, It would not bo
surprising to seo opposition develop
to the present Board of Education
at tho next election, when two are
to be chosen, as tho muddlo in the
payment of taxes does not sit well
with the average taxpayer and it
will take more than the rubber
stamp approval of a few who pose
as good government representatives
for tho voters to swallow candidates
lu November. Each succeeding elec
tion has shown a loss of strength
tor tho board candidates and their
latest move has capped tho climax.

MOURN HER DEATH.
Tho unexpected death of Mrs.
Anna HetherlngtOn Byrne, beloved
wife of Joseph W. Byrae, 1270
Brook street, removes from the com
munity an estimable Woman and a
Christian of high character. Mrs.

LABOR UNIONS
Itov. Father Ryan Finds Fivo
Good Reasons For Their
Existence.
Proves That Individuals Can Not
Deal On Equal Terms With
Corporation.
Organization Has Accomplished
Much For Benefit of All
Labor.
HAUE BEEN A GREAT SCHOOL
Five main reasons to prove tho
necessity of labor unions wero ad
duced by Rev. John A. Ryan, D. D.,
professor of economics at the Cath
olic University, Washington, D. C,
In tho first of a series of addresses
htlffWa tln HnAl.lH TO 1 Hi i.
uv.v.u. mo uiuumju r euuruuun or
German Catholic Societies.
"Facts of industry which prova the
necessity of labor unions," said Dr.
Ryan, "are:
"First tho unsatisfactory con
dition of the wage question esti
mates show that twd-thlrda of all
adult male workers receive less than
t iov per year, wnno irom bo to 60
per cent, of female workers receive
less than ?8 per week.
"Second tho length of tho hours
of labor demanded from so many
worKers.
"Third tho absence of safety de
vices and the resultant number of
unnecessary accidents.
"Fourth the absence of proper
sanitation In many departments of
Industry.
"Fifth the lack of compensation
for industrial diseases.
"Theso flvo facts, the exlstenco of
which can not be denied, prove the
necessity of organizations of work
ers for their own protection. Indi
vidually they can accomplish but
little, even when dealing with Indi
vidual employers, who aro becoming
dally more rare. When dealing with
corporations, which are really com
binations of employers, they can not
Individually accomplish anything.
Tho resources of the average laborer
aro small, sufficient to tide him over
a few weeks perhaps, seldom more;
while tho combination of employers,
the corporation In other words, has
resources many times greater.' and
MSAnftears, f or. ltsl 'existence he-
vuuov oviua inutviuuui uuinui
poses them. In the face of
and In the light of tho various laws
to Improve tho condition of labor
which havo found their way Into tho
statutes In recent years, it seems
strange that anyone should meet op
position in plans to organize the la
borers for their own protection and
betterment. Yet organization has
always had strong opposition. Thero
Is nothing finer In tho history of
democracy than tho fight of tho
heads of tho labor organization
against the opposition and Indiffer
ence that they found among tholr
own members.
"It is a fact of economics that tho
members of every class know some
thing about tho Interests of that
class better than anyono else, no mat
tor how well educated that other
person may bo. They do not know
everything about what Is best for
themselves, but they do know some
thing. That is why labor disre
garded theorists and organized
unions. Their organizations havo won
for them many things which wo re
gard as commonplace nowadays, be
cause wo aro accustomed to them,
but which In the early days of labor
unions wero unthought of. Tho
labor unions havo given men much
besides tho mero material ad
vantages, though those are most im
portant, especially inasmuch as tho
organizations have given men
greater bargaining power, greater
waiting power, tho power to back
up demands by unwillingness to
wprk under Improper conditions or
for improper salaries and not starvo
while remaining away from work
under protest.
"It Is not good for any class, save
children, to havo everything handed
down to them. They should have
something to say about tho condi
tions under which they live. They
should bo trained to express their
oplplons. The unions have been a
great school. They have taught real
democracy to their members; they
havo taught them how to debate and
to listen to debate. That Is ono of
their Important results.
"Actual material results justify
tho exlstenco of the labor unions,"
continued Dr. Ryan. "In whatever
line of activity laboring men or
women have organized, thoy havo
accomplished much to improve con
ditions. A comparison of any trade
in which men aro organized with
those in which no organization ex
ists will prove tho advantages of or
ganization. Of all the benefits that
havo cohio to labor In recent years,
more have come from labor unions
than from all other organizations to
gether." Aside from tho economic
argument for tho necessity of labor
unions. Dr. Ryan quoted as authority
for the proposition that labor Tinlons
are necessary the encyclicals of Pope
Leo XIII. on labor and the report
of tho Coramfsslori of Industrial Re
lations, His lectures on Industrial
economics are attracting great atten
tion In the East.
