LIGHT PLANT FIRES BODAYLA
ONE WEEK
OF SAHARA
By Edgar C. Wheeler
A week of near beer, soda pop,
raspberry drons and smiles!
At the end of the first lap
across the Sahara the Tacopia
camel awoke bright and early this
morning and felt his pulse.
It was beating sturdily, with
out a hitch. Proving Rgain that
a camel can go Leven days with
out a drink.
"I'll take a gin fizz," announc
ed a thirsty one as he put. his foot
on the rail at the Olympic club.
The bartender cracked a ioy
ous smile as he cast his eye over
the shelves loaded with beef tea,
U-No, Loju, Golden Foam, grape
Juice. He poured out a glass of j
buttermilk.
Not a Prohl Lecture, But—
Business" Why you can't beat j
it," he observed. "It's rushing. :
They're taking to the new slulf I
like a baby takes to a bottle. No
body seems to worry; everybody
seems to be happy and satisfied.
And we don't have to pay a $1,
--200 license fee."
This is not a prohibition lee-;
ture, but it's true.
The dire predictions of calam- •
ity, the doubts, fears and fore
bodlngs which have been on tho
lips of hundreds lor months, have
failed to materialize in Tacoma—
at leats during the first week of j
Sahara.
No More Biuwlh.
Have you taken a look about
the city since .Tan. 1 ?
There are faces that are iesa I
pale and drawn. There are
iaughß that are more frequent
and hearty.
And where are the brawls and I
ugly cursings that used to make'
the bartender irritable and sour? j
He draws his glass of soda pop
with a josh and the man at the
othpr side of the rail quaffs it to
the/ .nemory of other days and the
health of 1916.
. Everybody's feeling good, ex
cept the grippites. The old-fash
ioned sport which ushered in the
new year has continued. The
city is looking up.
Police Htatlon Idle.
At the expense of wet feet,
let's go Hi rounds in the slush.
At the police station all is as
Quiet as a graveyard. Yesterday
there were no names of offenders
on the court sheet, therefore, the
police court adjourned for a" va
cation. From 11:45 Thursday to
8:25 last night there was not a
single arrest —the longest quiet
period In the history of the police
department.
There have been Just two ar
rets for drunkenness in a week.
The Jail-bars have lost tholr
old-time friends and faces.
Dewey's Doubling Sl/.e.
But the candy stores and soda
fountains are the places where
the new faces are being seen.
Muehlenbruch's, for instance, has
noted a decided run on raspberry
drops and other sweets and tarts
which serve to oil up the jaws.
Dewey's, on Pacific avenue,
has rented the store next door and
Is doubling its capacity for serv
ing candy and soft drinks.
All the candy shops are put
ting in new supplies for a record
business. Soda fountains are
stocking up with the most in
heard-of concoctions in history of
every conceivable variety—pink,
white, red or green, whichever
you may prefer.
Order Hot "Chocs."
Chilly truck drivers draw np
their machines at the curb and
order a hot chocolate or a ginger
ale.
And the movies—the weather
has been as bad as it possible
could be for them, yet they all
say they've been having a clear
weather business. .
Business Is humming along at
its usual rate as If nothing out
of the way had happened. Busi
ness men are optimistic. Bank
presidents are looking for gains
In their savings deposits.
A north end women called up
Ople ft Co. yesterday. "Why
haven't you lowered my rent, now
that the saloons have gone out of
business?" she complained.
Just because nobody's rents

■ The new year brought a raft of stuff that
all we folks are glad for; the city's pepping
up with things that no one should be sad for.
*]] Lagrippe has hit Tacoma hard and all the
kids are sliding; the mayor's sox are sopping
wet and boozers law abiding. Chief Loomis
wants another job where he gets money for
his feats, while Louie Bean is getting steam
to swipe the city streets.
<I Doc Wall is diagnosing colds and Homer
Bone is single, while news stands clip the
liquor ads to please the county bindle. Ar
rests these days are very few since swell
barkeeps sell kickless brew. Our Romeo
sweeps city walks for mussing up our peace
ful cops.
CJ Society still dances; the Commercial club
advances. The city dads are hauling snow
and kerneljoab's due to blow.
<| The weather man announces rain and
banks declare a mighty gain. A great big
lumber shipment's due and preacher's jobs

are being lowered, Ople told her.
The only places which are getting
lower rents are those which used
to house saloons, say real estate
men, and these are not sufficient
to affect office buildings or resi
dences.
Bartenders Not Crumbling.
Saloonmen and bartenders,
those who have not already left
the city, are paying their rents
and their bills as usual, i Ii"
agents say. They have looked
dryness square in the face and
have turned to new lines of busi
ness confidently.
Tacoma people, even those who
felt they were hit the hardest and
kicked the hardest, have taken
the Sahara as it has come.
Crumbling has been notlcably ab
sent. The it- is a spirit of confi
dence in iht"'<yi\
RowlaH^ View of It.

from Commissioner Woods'
snow haulers yet?
Yesterday we wrote an item
demanding where, oh where, Is

business.
And while we are bawling

Bke to say that If the busi

'Zblood!
The principal reason why a
man can't drown his sorrows
aside from the fact this Is a dry
town—ts that they are not locat
ed in his stomach.
As a matter of fart, if yon
owned one, you wouldn't ob

your goat.
Folks, let's show Will Hum
phrey, the Seattle congressman,
how we appreciate Me efforts.
the dry committee, claims his pre
diction that drinking would be
cut down 90 per cent has already
been fulfilled.
"Men I know who voted against
prohibition are now coming to me
with the statement that they be
lieve it will work out as a good
thing after all. They are taking
it as it comes," he says.
Men who drink occasionally
have stored up enough liquor to
supply their wants.
Just Hits One Class.
But the fellow who has made
his drink a life habit, who has
saturated himself with it every
day—he's the one fellow in the
city whom the dry law has hIA,
and hit hrad. Soda pop is a
mighty poor substitute for him.
Cive him a little time to make
the switch, and he says he'll come
back right.
For this is the year of promise.
Let's everybody—everybody who
belongs, that Is—send him a let
ter, like this:
Dear Will: We, the mem
bers of the Knockers' club
of Taroma, want to express
our sincere appreciation of
the efforts of yourself, the
king of knockers, to knock
the props out of prosperity.
We heartily agree wtlh yon
that the country is going to
the dogs. We hope that panic
which you predict will come
noon. We just dote on panics.
Hurrah!
Fraternally yours, etc.

MR, WILL E. SALOME
K-N.O-C-K-E-R
Congressman Will E. Humphrey of Seattle would be a lot happier these days if the United States
were in the throes of a fearful panic. There are some people like that—croakers, who are never happy
unless others suffer. Humphrey made a speech in congress this week. He said: (1) We have no pros
perity. (2) We are not going to have prosperity unless the democrats are kicked out of office. (3) Even
if we have prosperity, it won?t last. /
"Why should not the fct|mer be prosperous?" Humphrey shouted. "Of course he is. Crops have
been the biggest on record, ajid the United States farmer has been feeding the greatest armies in the
world." But don't give the democrats credit for this prosperity, Humphrey warns you. Besides, this
prosperity won't last, he say&' If the democrats stay in office and Wilson remains on the job, WE'LL
BE IN A WORSE PANIC AFTER THE WAR, he predicts, THAN THE NATION HAS EVER SEEN.
ISN'T HE A FINE SPECIMEN TO BE RUNNING FOR UNITED STATES SENATOR?
A FEW REMARKS TACOMANS DROPPED
Here are a few unusual
remarks dropped in Taco
ma during the week. They
range, as you can see,
from the near-sublime to
the quite-ridiculous.
MRS. ELIZABETH CJLLEY,
sightseer: "Can 1 wear a bird of
paradise while I stop here a few
hours?"
COMMISSIONER T. R. 4 P.
Mlll«: "I wouldn't give a cent
for a boy who wouldn't coast."
DOC WALL: "The protection
of the neck ought to be considered
much less than that of the an
kles "
U. S. JUDGE RUDKIN: "If
your point is well taken, wa
we wouldn't have prohibition for
some years, would we?"
"JAP" FUGINA: Oh, Cotter-
Hi's a fanatic. He's a smart man,
though, at that."
PROSECUTOR REMA NN:
"Toung Cushman will have to
"Business has been flat on its back, gazing at the
stars, wondering if it will ever be able to stand erect
again."
"The fact is that the country is blessed only with
a local, spotted, temporary, spasmodic prosperity."
"But for the war, we would be in the midst of pan
ic and poverty that would make the days of '93 to '97
look like greatest prosperity by comparison."
'True, we have the largest wheat crop in history,
but why should not the farmer be prosperous when
he is feeding the greatest armies this world has ever
seen?" •
"Our present prosperity is the prosperity of mis
ery and misfortune."

lessness just the same as a jitney
driver would."
H. V. CHASE: "Oneness of
purpose, oneness of endeavor, one

to accomplish anything worth
while for a community."
RKV. A. D. SHAW: "I'm a

to be in the thick of the fight."
ROMEO HAOEN: "I've been

ROGER E. CHABE, chairman
of the Montamara Festo commit
tee: "I'm finding thst Tacoma
has altogether too many young
men who are unwilling to back
the older men in what they are
trying to do, yet who won't start
anything themselves."
EVERETT TRUE, w. k. pest
killer: - "Never strike a lady or
your wife."
DR. ST. CLAIR OSBORN, W. C.

women should propose."

'CALLS'
DRAKE
Commissioner Drake, head of
the light and water department.

Mayor Fawcett during council
session, because he had hired John
Rodayla, a dim-barged police offl

Drake thereupon announced
that Rodaylu had been released
from his department last night,
following the uppearanc« of The)
Times story regarding his reap*
pearanco on the public payroll.
"It seems to me, Mr. Drakj,
I hat the city Is setting a mightlng
bud example by re-employing 1 Ii las
man after he had been discharged
from the police department undei 1
charges of uttacking a young
girl," said Fawcett.
"From all that I understand,
it is a most serious case. Not only
is the man awaiting trial, but it
1h reported that someone has splr*
Red away the girl whom he at*
tacked, so that she could not ap
pear against him in court. I ant
exceedingly surprised and grieved
at your action,"
Drake explained that Hodaylsji
hud already been discharged. '
"We understood that the man's
family was destitute, and It wan
for that reason that Supt. Ar<
quette gave him v position In the
light department," he said. "Wo)
did not know anything about hie
record. We let him out imiuedt*
ately when we learned of It.
