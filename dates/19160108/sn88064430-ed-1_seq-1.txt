NEW PROPOSALS IN L._ 'A- . .
CASE WILL BE SUBMITTEC T`)
THE UNITED STATES.
Washington.-New proposals fror.:
(;ermany for a settlement of the Lu i
tania controversy. which the Berlin
foreign ottice hopes will be acceptable
to the Unltea states. are expected to
be presented to the State Department
next week. It is understood the ne
gotiations between Secretary Lansing ]
and Count Von Bernstorff, the German
ambassador, recently progressed to a
point where a settlement was expected
at Christmas. It was said the Ger
man proposals resulting from these
conversations probably would arrive
soon after New Year's Day.
Infcrmation received here indicates
that the Berlin foreign office is
anxious to end the controversy, .n
spite of adverse public opinion said to
have been aroused by the American
requests for withdrawal of the German
naval and military attaches and the
demands upon Austria-Hungary as a
rsult of the sinking of the Ancono.
The present status of the negotia
tions is very closely guarded. The
United States has contended for a dis
avowal of the sinking of the Lusi
tania and reparation for the American
lives lost. A pfoposal by termany to
arbitrate the question of indemnity I
was rejected. It has since been sug
gested that Germasy might make re
Iparation with the understanding that
it would involve no admission of
wrongdoing. It is understood that no
agreement will st.isfy the United
- States unless it contains something in
the nature of a disavowal, but Ger
many contends that her instructions
to submarine commanders to discon
tinue such attacks as that on the Lus
itania is the most effective disavowal
that could be given.
It is regarded here as especially sig
nificant that a settlement of the Lui
tania case should become imminent at
a time when Teutonic diplomatic cir
cles are represented as being prepared
for a diplomatic break between the
United States and Austria-Hungary.
Clearing up of the Lusitania case, oft!
cials believe, would have an important
bearing on the controversy with Vien
na. That situation remained unchang
ed. without word from Ambassador
J Penfileld or any official indication of
when Austria's reply to .ecretary
Lansing's renewed demands might be
expected.
