Four years aeo Daanirf uehered
ia the plan of mal.ing the t-st day of
school aa aCair to be remembered
during the whole year.
Tha Brat school opening was ad
dressed by local ministers, the next
by Dr. David Eoaa-Eoyd, Mayor Cor
bett and others; last year by Gov. W.
C. McDonald, and thia year, distin
guished military men graoed the oe-
eaaion with their presence aad ad
dresses that will beeoane a part of
tha lives of thoaa fortunate enough
to bo present. ,
Supt. J. B. Taylor presided in his
usual efficient manner.
Tha first to be enjoyed by the apian
did audience that filled to overflowing
the large auditorium, was a piano
duet, "Grand Polka do Concert"
Homer Newton Bartlett by Misses
Katharine Wamel and Estehr Bolioh.
These talented musicians, both with
Boston training, never fail to make a
bit and are alwaya willing to assist
on public occasions. .
Supt J. B. Taylor called upon the
Graphic editor to give a few words
of cheer to his young friends in the
high school and to call attention to
each of the distinguished guests.
The chief address of ths morning
was delivered by .Major M. A. De
Laney, head of the hospital corps at
Caaux Demise- and fovamerly White
Bouse physician. Coming from such
undoubted authority, the address will
be rend with the keenest interest by
everyone. Following a very compli
mentary introduction by Supt. Tay
lor, Major DeLaney said :
Snperitendent, Teachers, Ladies and
Gentlemen :
It is always- a pleasure to meet
those interested in education, an
I wnnt to express my appreciation of
your courtesy. Indeed your hospital
ity has been unlimited to us all.
Bidden, however, by your invitation,
to say a few words to you on hy
giene and sanitation. ' I am reminded
of whet Mark Twain said about 40
yeas ago; that: "when we double our
educational facilities, we double our
death rate." That might have been
true when it was uttered, but it is
for from bein into today. Hygiene
and sanitary science have changed it
all and by rational living and care
of our bodies we find that in the last
75 years almost 12 years has been
added to the span of human life.
We have learned that good ventila
tion, proper fond and clothing are
esNcntinl to keep our school children
strong and henlthy. Compare hur
school children in the United States
with those who are neglected, as the
Filipinos for example, where 60 per
cent of the children die before the
end of first year life. See what care
Iiiim done in the prevention of the
groat white plague. It is now con
sidered that most eases of tubercu
losis originate in childhood and under
the stress and hardships of life devel
op in Inter years. Few of ua know
that according to the CENSUS RE
PORT 1000, 3H per cent of all deaths
are cnused by this disease. In the
last IA years tills mortality haa been
reduced about 20 per cent; and it ia
known that the disease is curable.
Through vaccination smallpox ia now
quite unknown to the civilized man.
