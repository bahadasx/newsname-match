67th YEAR
MACON. MISSISSIPPI, FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 15. 1916.
NUMBER 48
Opening of High School
The Macon Graded and High School
opened Monday morning with one of
1 he largest enrollments in the history
c: the school" The first chapel exer
cises of the session were held at ten
o'clock and a large number of parents
were present. Rev. E. N. Broyles
conducted the exercises. He made an
excellent talk on "Aspirations," and
urged pupils not despise little things
but to work up from them to higher
ehings.
After the chapel exercises the
Parent Teacher Association had a
meeting while Mrs. L. F. Holberg pre
sided. Miss Paulk, the Home Econ
omics teacher of the high school,
spoke to the association on her work,
enlisting the support and co-operation
of all members in equipping a sewing
and cooking room and building up her
department.
Miss Paulk is a graduate of the I., I.
& C. She holds a high school diploma,
diploma from the Normal de
partment of the I, I.. & C. and
a B. 8. degree from the same
college, where she specialized in sew
ing and cooking with a view to becom
ing a home economics "teacher. In
her last year in college she taught
home econ amies in one of the rural
Bchools of Lowndes county. Since her
graduation she has been assisting the
Home Economics agent of Lee County,
She is practical in her work and the
school feels fortunate in securing her
services. It is hir plan to give one
hour each day to those outside of
school who wish to take the sewing
and cooking. For this the school will
charge a small tuition which will be
used to better equip the Home Econ
omics room.

Miss Janie Stennis, principal of high
school and teacher, of History; Miss

Agent Ifabt Wttt Point for
$3,600
West Point, Miss., Sept. 12. Assist
ant State Revenue Agent Moore from
1 Water Valley, is in the city making a
noise like he was going tn take some if
the long green back home with him.
He caught the city of West Point for
$3,600 back tax from 1900 to 1916, the
state and county have been paying the
city out of the Chickasaw school funds
on a per capita basis when as a matter
of fact they should have been paying
on area or land basis. Mr. Moore gets
his authority from a law passed by the
legislature in 1833. He says 1900 is
far as he can trace it as all records
prior to 1900 are lost.
There is considerable dissatisfaction
on the part of the county and city offi
cials on account of Mr. Moore charg
ing them twenty per cent for a settle
ment of $900 that he had nothing to do
with at all. The county and city had
agreed on a settlement and the city
agreed to wait on the county for the
above settlement until the sheriff
made his final settlement in Sc pterr.-
ber. The revenue agent contenc's
that the sheriff must settle with the
city every thirty days and the city
board had no right to waive a settle
ment. A settlement was made with
Mr. Moore by issuing two warrants
with the understanding that he sub
mits the tay.i.m otatc lu-venue Agent
Robinson for his approval.

How can one state compel an
other to pay it a money debtl For
lifty years Virginia has been try
ii.g to make Vest Virginia pay
a part of what was the state debt
of Virginia at the time when
West Virginia set up a separate
existence. The Supreme court
has finally rendered judgment in
the sum of thirteen million dol
lars, but West Virginia argues
that the court has no power to en
force the decision, and that, in
any case, the state has no property
against which levy may properly
be made. There the matter rests.
This is the way a person . who
contemplates buying land, or
equipment or live stock for his
farm, can get aid under the new
rural credit law: First he must
join a local association, composed
of ten or more citizens of bis com
munity, or, if no local association
is formed, a local bank may act
as agent. If the conditions of
the loan are satisfactory, the local
association or the bank indorses
the application and the Federal
Land Bank furnishes the money.
The amount that can be obtained
is half the value of the land. It
must be secured by a first mort
gage, with interest at no more
than six per cent. The loan may
run fiora live to forty years. The
interest and a small portion of
the principal must be paid annu
ally or semi annually. When the
last interest payment is made, the
principal is also paid.
NOTICE! NOTICEII
I will leave Macon about September
2fth, so must close all accounts before
this date. I will appreciate it if all
my friends will pay promptly on pre
sentation of same, as my time is too
limited to call more than once if it can
be avoided. Thanking all in a ivance, I
am Very respectfully,

FROM THE PEOPLE
Editor the Beacon:
Well, the strike is settled. We had
inside information days ago that it
would be. Had it not been an election
year it would have been settled much
sooner. But the big interests that are
fighting Wilson urged the rail heads
on and they made the strongest bluff
they dared. We have good reasons to
believe that Chicago, which sometimes
goes over a hundred thousand Republi
can majority, will go for Wilson by
from 30 to 50 thousand; this effect due
to the labor vote which is tremendous.
John Sharp Williams' interview in
which he said he just knew, just felt
there would be no Btrike, though bis
intellect did not tell him so, sized up
the situation. There were any num
ber of reasons for thinking the strike
would come, and yet a positive convic
tion that it would not. It was a tre
mendous moral victory for Wilson.
I kno you will be interested in the
negro question here. In a population
of 3,000,000, Chicago has 45,000 ne
groes according to census returns. I
see a good many. Many of them are
footmen, who, dressed up like a Ger
man field marshal, stand in front of
hotels and receive the gueBts and their
baggage, or band them into autos
when they go away. I have seen none
with that absolute poise and elegant
grace and courtesy of Hez, nor any
that makes the figure Joh..-Holmes
would in number 14 patent leather red
top boots and tight fitting riding
breeches.
Mr. Cochran, our chief, was telling
me the other day about Senator Wil
liams. When the news comes to the
cloak rooms that he is speaking all get
up and go in to hear. He praises the
senator's ability extravagantly, but it
is deserved. Sometimes Mr. Williams,
when a Republican is speaking, will
come to the senate chamber door, put
hi? up to bi ear nd listen for r

his head will go back to his committee
room, which means it is not worth re
plying to.
This department is mailing ont arti
cles once a week to 4696 weekly papers
regularly, and about a thousand more a
week to certain of them, for instance
something on woman suffrage to suf
frage states, certain other stuff to cer
tain states, etc. In addition we have a
daily list to which matter is Bent daily

DeYampert Brame came in yester
day. He came up to help President
Markham of the I. C. handle the strike
situation. I understand several other
Macon boys are coming. It will be
pleasant to have them here.
The view from my window is beauti
ful. Yesterday was a clear bright
day. Looking over the lake toward
the sun you saw a broad expanse of
shimmering silver extending from the
lake shore as far as the eye could
reach. The rest of the lake was an ex
quisite moving green flecked with
white-caps the fine breeze whipped the
water into. Many steamers were in
sight and bunches of grayish smoke in
the far distance hung over vessels hull
down over the horizon, and out of
sight.
A copy of the Chicago paper with
the telegram from representatives of
300,000 workers of Chicago to Presi
dent Wilson on Labcr Day was sent
you. There is no telling how many
voters the above number embraces.
Women vote for presidential electors
in Illinois and of the 300,000, 200,000 or
more may be voters. This is some
thing more than a straw showing the
way of the wind. It is certainly en
couraging and confirmatory of the re
ports we get that Chicago is going 30,
000 for Wilson instead of 100,000 Re
publican as it has done at times,
Mrs. Ella Flagg Young, Chicago's
famous former superintendent of
schools, one of the greatest and prob
ably the best known woman in Ameri
ca, ban announced, fqrWson. This
and Edison's great influence and en
dorsement of Wilson are not only pow
erful in themselves, but mean so much
as indicating the way the leading inde
pendent minds in the country are go
ing. There is no use praising something
that everybody must admire and so I
make no comment on the President's
speech of acceptance. It has never
been excelled. His speech at the Lin
coln memorial was equally good. And
John Sharp Williams' speech there
was as fine; in some respects I think it
even better, having a certain warmth
of feeling that the more coldly intel
lectual speech of the president lacked.
His bringing out the likeness between
Lincoln and Jefferson and Jefferson
Davis was a notable and characteristic
thing. When you get into the upper
reaches of things, the high:r atmos
phere, Mississippi's senator has no
superior. I got s copy of his speech
out of the Commercial and the senators
and congressmen here all borrowed it
to read.
The Spanish-American War Veterans
had a reunion here last week and one
of them told me that not only did the
Republican members of the organiza
tion have little enthuaia m for Hughes,
but that they had no hope. Things
are looking nlmoBt too good. Ed
Wyndham useJ to cay, before he
quit, that wh ;n 1 e caught four aces
something was wrong, the deal was a
fake or he misread his hand or some
thing. Well, Vi ilson's chances look so
sure thst I fear we misread the signs,
or something. But 1 reckon not; they
are n3 better than they ought to be
with his record and tharacter.
We are getting in copies of the
country papers now and they are
using our stuff. We are getting re
quests for l,0t0 copies, 2.C00 copies, of
some of the articles, this is mighty
pleasing.
I heard a rattling on the avenue the
other day and saw an auto, with a
bridal couple in ft all decked with
flowers, etc, Tacked pn behind, unbe
knownst to them, were several old
shoes and tin cans and a big placard
"Why go to Europe to fight. Stay at
home and get married."
I am a commuter now, living two
miles from Main street so to speak.
But there are twenty miles of city be
yond me. I went last night to see
Mitzi Hajos in Pom Pom. In appear
ance and acting she is very like Maude
Adams in Peter Pao. She is an Aus
trian. They say the Austrians are the
most attractive people in the world.
One can easily believe that after see
ing Mile. Hajos and seeing her act.
Just as I am writing this the sen
ators and congressmen, just out of
congress and on their way home, begin
to come in. There are more of them
in the building now than there are col
onels on Bilbo's staff. H. If.
Sam Old Story
The farmers in North Missis
sippi have been bumped hard by
the boll weevil this year.
Two or three years ago, when
repeated warnings were given
to the farmers in that section to
be prepared for an invasion of
the pest, they merely smiled and
declared that the weevil would
not do any material damajtt
that far north; that the low tem
peratures during winter monthi
would effectually 'destroy th
pest.
As is usually the case, the
farmers were mistaken. They
planted a large cotton acreatr
this year, many of them ne
glected foodstuffs and forage
crops, ana, as a consequence,
they are in the middle of a bsd
fix. .
Some day, perhaps, the farmer
will learn that advice given him
by those who are interested in
his material welfare ought to be
seriously considered. Jackson
