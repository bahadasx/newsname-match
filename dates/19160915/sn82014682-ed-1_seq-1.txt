"We believe that because of the fact that the Inter-Island Steamship
Company has a monopoly of the inter-island carrying business, it totally
disregards the convenience of the public. We believe that, con
sidering the service given, the freight rates on general merchandise are
extortionate. ' There are Innumerable complaints as to service." From
Maul -Thamber of Commerce's complaint to the Public UUlities Commis
sion. .V :
Ilates and service of tlie Inter-Island Steam Navigation Company are
under fire at a meeting of the Public Utilities Commission, which began
at 2 o'clock this afternoon. .
A committee from the Maui Cbam-I

the most emphatic complaint from a

against the steamship company. The
committee declares Itself ready to

F1rt: , Ratea on .Cattle : ' -"
"We believe that the raise on the
freight on cattla frorm Kahulul in Tiew
of the excellent shipping facilities is
unwarranted unreasonable and. dls
; criminatory.;. The freight rate on cat
tle fro n Kahulul to Honolulu Is $5 per
head, to which is added a wharfage
: charge of &0c per head. The cattle
are driven on the steamer from the
wharf and with practically no loss Of
time to the steamer. Mr. William
Walsh, superintendent of the Kahulul
-Railroad Company, informs this com
mittee that on one occasion 52 -head
' of cattle were loaded on the steamer
Claudia at Kahulul within 60 seconds
after the time they were driven upon
' the wharf. This is of course the best
time of which record has been kept,
but Mr. Wal&i further informs this
. committee that the average time for
loading 50 head of cattle at Kahulul
is not more than 15 minutes, and
. that the loading is done, with practi
cally no risk of tnjary to the cattle.
"As a comparison attention la called
to the fact (hat the rate on cattle from
. Kaupo is 5 per head, 'where the cat
tle must be swum to the small boats,
towed to the steamer and hoisted on
i the . steamer by the steamer's crew,
under which condition the time con
sumed and labor Involved Is very
much greater -
"On account of the excellent facili
ties at Kahulul a special rate prevails
on pigs from Kahulul to Honolulu and
we believe that Tor the same reason
the ahippera of cattle from Kahulul
should be entitled to the aame consid
eration. ." .- .'

Investigation of Rates Brings
to Light Facts That De
mand Strong Action
As a result of an investigation Into
territorial bonding payments, made at
the instance of Governor Pink ham
through his secretary and Territorial
Attorneys L M. Stainback and W. H.
Heen, it is likely that radical changes
will be proposed to the legislature
next spring for lessening the bonding
bills of the territory.
Two plans are now under consid
eration it was stated today either to
extend the present' territorial fund
which now covers fire Insurance to
Include bonding Insurance as well, or
to provide some system of competition
whereby bonding rates will be de
creased. ,
Discrimination Is Seen
"Our investigation has shown," says
Attorney-General I. M. Stainback,
-that territorial and federal officials
are placed in different classifications
by the) bonding companies which do
business In- the 'territory. Whereas
federal officials pay a rats' of only
$1 for $1000; territorial employes are
required - by the same companies to
pay $5 or $6. s . V
; fit ia certainly high time that some
definite steps be taken to remedy
such a condition of affair's, and espe

'The commanding general of the

mander and the legal government.

in view of the unsupportable situation
of the troops under his command, me
