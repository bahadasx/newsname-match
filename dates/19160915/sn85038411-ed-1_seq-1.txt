It was a cheerful and optimistic and |
public-spirited group of representative
citizens who broke bread together at
the Harrisburg Club last night and
launched the million-dollar hotel
which will rise on the ashes of the old J
Opera House as another monument to j
the enterprise and loyalty of Harris- !
burg.
These prominent men, representa
tive of the best energy of the com- ;
munlly, were the guests of E. Z. Wal
lower, chairman of the special com
mittee of the Chamber of Commerce
which had made the preliminary can
vass and rendered possible the final
steps in the organization of the hotel
company. There was a distinct atmos
phere of jubilation surrounding the
dinner. All present felt that a great
thing had been accomplished for Har
risburg.
After a thorough discussion of the
matter thos'e present, representing the
first subscribers to the fund of a mil
lion dollars, were organized as a meet
ing of stockholders, with the president
of the Chamber of Commerce, J. Wil
liam Bowman, in the chair. As the
host of the evening Mr. Wallower out
lined the plans and told the story of
how he came to be interested in the
hotel proposition here. He believed
it was a civic duty, and as a successful
businessman himself he also im
pressed upon those present his own
conviction that It was likewise to be
a business* success.
All the speeches were in happy vein
and many a pleasant little incident
was related of the "persistenous" ef
forts of the committee to filch from
the pockets of the local people suf
ficient funds to provide the big hostelry
that is now assured. Throughout the
evening nere was crystallized the one

efforts was now to be a modern hotel.

The British resumed the offensive
to-day in a powerful attack north of
the Somme in northern France. Ac
cording to London they have driven
back the German lines from about
a mile and a quarter to nearly a mile
and three-quarters at some places, in
an assault along: a six-mile front.
The line of the attack extended from
Bouleaux wood northwest of Combles.
to a point north of the Albert-Ba
paume road, which runs through Po

As a preliminary to to-day's ex

Haig's forces last night attacked and
captured German trenches along a

Practical obstacles have arisen in the

suggestions for the pacification of the
border which make it seem improb
able at this time that any agreement

Deny Report That Hershey
Was to Deed Over Farms
The report that M. S. Hershey, the
'Chocolate King," will formally trans
fer most of his property .as a perma
nent foundation for the Hershev Indus
trial School, was declared incorrect and
unauthentic In a statement Issued at
Hershey to-day.
The report included a probable plan
that all of the property owned by Mr.
Hershey, except his residence, chocolate
factory, trust company and transit
company, will be transferred; the total
acreage to reach 10,000, with an ap
proximate valuation of $2,000,000. The
following statement was sent to th*>
Telegraph:
"The report is incorrect and un
authorized. No moneys have been dis
cussed and no plan has been fixed. As
a matter of management a closer or
ganization of various interests here i
being made, but the work will not be
completed for some time. The change
of system will put the enterprise, wltn
exceptions of present corporations, in
to two main groups, the factory and
its departments being one, and the Her
shey Industrial School and certain farm
and town interests being the other.
What will grow out of this rearrange
ment when completed, remains to o
determined, but so far there has been
no conclusion, because the work of or
ganization is still going on. Mr. Hei •
shey h< s always said he woula
strenghe the Industrial School, and he
<U>clded several months ago to add an- i
, ether unit of twenty boys."

What Shall the
Hotel Be Named?
During the dinner at the Harris
burg Club at which Uie million-dol
lar hotel project was successfully
launched, William T. Hildrup, Jr.,
made a motion Uiat was promptly
adopted that the Telegraph lx re
quested to invite suggestions for an
appropriate name for the new hotel.
These suggestions will be received
and referred to the board of direc
tors to guide, them in the final
choice of a name. Mr. Hildrup has
been one of the strong lioosters for
the new hotel and he believes the
people of the city wfli be greatly
interested in helping to select a
popular name. Already anion# the
suggestions is the "Susquehanna,"
the "John Harris," "The Fenn"' and
