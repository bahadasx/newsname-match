LOGAN'S FORT SITE
MARKED FOR ALL TIME BY IM
POSING MONUMENT.
Impressive Ceremonies When Un
veiling Was Held Under D. A.
R. Auspices Last Week.
(Contributed by a D. A. R.)
In haste to make money, we Amer
icans are prone to neglect many in
teresting and worth-while events that
transpired in the days of our fore
fathers, but thanks to our organiza
tion and women of the country, we
sometimes revert to historic days. In
this instance the St. Asaph Chapter,
Daughters of American Revolution
of Danville, called to our modern
minds the founding of Logans ort.
Last year this Chapter erected a
stone monument with marker and
last Friday it was unveiled and
placed in our keeping. It isn t the
value of a thing, but the meaning
it conveys and what greater honor
could we have than to know people
elsewhere recognize and reverence
the historic spots in our city. At
3:30 last Friday afternoon, several
Iiundred people witnessed the im
pressive dedicatory ceremonies, con
ducted at the marker, in the yard of
Mr. J. B. Camenisch, just north-west
of the water works. Miss Esther
Burch, Regent of Logan-Whitley
Chapter, acted as chairman.
The service was opened with pray
er by Rev. Welburn. Hon. P. M.
McRoberts welcomed the guests
with his usual air of welcome and
told us a bit of history in connection
with the Fort. The tablet which
was very patriotic in its appearance,
with two large American flags, two
smaller ones, and a huge wreath was
unveiled by little Miss Elizabeth
Ganfield and Master Henry Jackson
of Danville. Mrs. Patty Bell Engle
man gave a most interesting paper
which brought to our minds the
courage and indomitable purpose of
these ancient settlers.
Mrs. Engleman's Paper.
Daughters of the American Revolu
tion and Friends: As such I greet
vou; friends are born, not made, at
least it is so in the highest sense of
the term. There is a bond of friend
ship, which I cannot explain, nor
will I try to explain, which exists
between all Daughters of the Amer
ican Revolution.
This spot is sacred to the memory
of the Logans and Montgomery.
Right here is where the old Logan i s
Fort stood; at the foot of the hill
the crvstal water of St. Asaph Spring
bubbled and gurgled in glee, and
Tushed through the forests to the riv
er and on to the ocean; to the south
between the ravine, the salt water
flowed where the buffaloes came to
quench their thirst, from which the
Buffalo Spring gained its name.
Will you let me tell you a bit ot
romantic history that was told me by
mv grandmother, Mary Montgomery
Helm, and was told to her by her
grandmother, Mary Greenlea Mont
gomery, showing that love was as
warm and true in those perilous pio
neer days, as today, when the calm
of peace hovers over our homes like
a brooding dove; their partiotism
was as great; their aspirations were
as lofty; their ideals as high. Ideals
are like the stars, we cannot touch
them with our hands, but like the
seamen upon the waste of waters, we
can choose them for our guides, and
bv following them, reach our destiny.
'"Ideals are the world's masters,
and bv them was Florence Montgom
erv influenced, in the days of long
ago. when the buffalo, the bear, the
swift-footed deer and the wolf with
its blood-curdling howl, made the
night hideous, roamed the unbroken
forests.
Then came those sturdy pioneers,
bringing with them their wives and
children, their lares and penates;
and here on this spot they pitched
their tents and built with logs, hewn
from primeval forests, "Logan's
Fort." The Fort was broad and
deep with a wide chimney. As the
days went by the dread of an attack
from the Indians grew less and less.
There was a generous spirit of co
operation and the men of the differ
ent forts would help each other
plant and gather their crops. One
bright spring morning when the air
was as stimulating as wine, and
redolent with the perfume of flowers,
and the song of the wild bird made
melody, the men rode off to a near
by fort, leaving their loved ones in
the care of the priest, (and now this
seems a very strange coincidence,
that fort that was near was "Whit
lev's Fort.") The children were wild
with delight to play out of the fort
in the bright sunlight. A cry of
joy rang out on the air, saying:
"The wild turkeys are here; the wild
turkeys are here," when the priest
rushed them back into the safety of
the fort, fastening the great oaken
bar, and he was none too soon, tell
ing them that it was the Indians try
ing to deceive them.
The Indians, finding that they had
failed to gain an entrance into the
fort, raced around trying to find a
spot by which they could enter and
capture the women and children.
Perfectly infuriated, and with tom
ahawks raised and with savage yells,
they continued their mad race; find
ing no vulnerable spot, they set fire
to the Fort; then the prayers of
priest and women and the agonizing
cry of the children were heard. With
rare courage, Florence Montgomery
calmed the tumult, and told the
priest to unbar the fort, that one life
had better be lost than all; she was
.ready for the supreme sacrifice of
self for her people. She gave a
heart message for her lover, who had
ridden away in a joyful mood, whist
ling as gayly as the robins, for soon
they were to be married. After much
pleading, mid the benediction of
priest and kin she slipped through
the door with a calm and dauntless
courage. The Indians saw her, and
with yells of demons, the chase be
gun; round and round they went,
faster and more furious grew the

was killed by Baxter Bright, a dep
uty. The shooting took place at

Mr. Allen Loses Pants
Burglar Breaks Into Well Known
Citizen's Residence.
A burglar entered Mr. J. A. Al
len's home on East Main street at
about 3 o'clock Thursday morning
and stole his best pair of pants and
got the $5 or $6 he had in change
in the pockets. Planning to join his
wife in Louisville Thursday, Mr. Al
len had had his trousers cleaned and
pressed and was going to look his
best when he joined his wife. But
man proposes and God disposes and
his arrangements were knocked into
a cocked hat. He awoke just as the
intruder, who was a negro, was get
ting out of the window, and took af
ter him. He stopped neither for
shoes or other wearing apparel, but
followed him up Logan avenue.
Reaching the home of his son-in-law,
N. W. Fowle, Mr. Allen borrowed
that gentleman's pistol but it was
too late then, as the burglar was out
of sight. Only a few days ago Mr.
Allen had given his shot gun to Scott
Hamilton, or the darkey might not
have fared so well. Donning a pair
of winter trousers, Mr. Allen left on
the 4:39 train and enjoyed the day
in Louisville quite as much as if he
had not had the misfortune to lose
his pants.

promising democrat of the old-school
variety, and none could ever be
more loyal to his friends than he.
He was a brilliant and intellectual
man, a fine talker, and of strong per
sonality. In addition to his wife,
who was Miss Jean Vinson, of Cat
lettsburg, he is survived by his moth
er, Mrs. William Allin. Funeral

OIL IN ROCKCASTLE.
Much interest was aroused here
this week over the rumor from
Rockcastle that oil has been struck
in a well about three miles south
west of Mt. Vernon. Quite a num

Rockcastle county and in the eastern
section of this county, the oil experts
seeming to think that the Estill coun

tion south and east of Crab Orchard
has practically all been leased to oil
people, and splendid prospects of lo
cating oil in that section, are said to
be had. Everyone who has investi
gated the matter, believes that there
is a large pool of oil under Lincoln
county, but the question is to locate
it.

Death's Heavy Hand
Laid Heavily Upon Prominent West
End Family This Week.
Death is at all times sad, but it
is particularly so when it comes to
those in the very prime of life and
who are so much needed, as it did in
the case of Mrs. John B. Riffe, of
Hustonville, on Wednesday after
noon. By her taking away three
sons are left motherless and a de
voted husband must climb the hill
alone. God grant that they may all
be given strength to withstand the
irreparable loss they have sustained.
Mrs. Riffe, "who .was Miss Nannie
Carpenter, a daughter of Sandy T.
Carpenter, of the West End, was 42
years old and had been since her
childhood a devout member of the
Christian church. She was as beau
tiful of character as she was of
face and her friends were numbered
by her acquaintances. Light-hearted
and happily disposed, she got the
best out of life and impressed those
among whom she mingled that with
her life was worth the living. A pity
it is that she was not spared longer
to spread sunshine and bring happi
ness to hearts in gloom. The three
sons that survive her are fine, man
ly fellows, but they are just at the
ages when a mother's love and ad
vice is so much needed. They are
Julian, John and Jesse Riffe, who
with their father have the sympathy
of a large circle of friends. De
ceased was only ill two days. Ev
ery effort possible was made to save
her, but medical skill was unequal
to the emergency. The burial took
place in the Hustonville cemetery
Thursday afternoon after appropri
ate remarks at the grave by her pas
tor, Rev. A. H. Baugh, Eld. J. Q.
Montgomery, of Liberty, and Rev.
L. Brandenburg, of the Baptist
church. A great crowd gathered at
the grave to pay the last tribute to
the excellent young wife and moth

Examining Trial Put Off
Commonwealth Witness 111 When
Morgan Case Was Called.
The examining trial of Sweeney
Morgan, prominent Garrard county
farmer, who shot his son-in-law,
Booth Sutton to death last week,
was postponed to Tuesday on motion
of the Commonwealth, when called
in the Garrard county court Thurs
day. A. material witness for the
prosecution was sick and unable to
be present, which caused the
postponement. Mr. Morgan has
retained Attorneys L. L. Walker and
James I. Hamilton to defend him,
while Attorney Joe E. Robinson was
employed to assist in the prosecu
tion. The Lancaster Record says that
the following evidence was brought
out at the coroner's inquest: Mr.
Sutton had been drinking and trou
ble occurred between him and his
wife at their home. Mrs. Sutton
left home and went to the home of
her sister, Mrs. Frank Holtzclaw,
who lives about two or three hun
dred yards from the Sutton home.
Sutton followed and came to the
Holtzclaw home with a shotgun. An
other quarrel ensued and Mrs. King
a sister of Mr. Morgan interposed.
At this time Mrs. Sutton is said to
have gone to the home of a neigh
bor, Mr. Bruce Lawson and tele
phoned to Sheriff Ballard to . come
and arrest her husband. At about
this time Mr. Morgan is said to have
learned of the trouble from a little
son of Mr. Frank Holtzclaw, and
with a shotgun, went from his home
to the Holtzclaw home, a distance
of about one hundred yards. On ar
riving there, as testified by Mrs.
King, Mr. Sutton said, "Get up from
there Grace," and fired at Sutton,
who was sitting on the porch, from
a distance of about ten feet. The
shot entered just over the heart, cut
ting the aorta. Mr. Morgan says
that he shot in self defense, and
that Mr. Sutton was rising from his
seat and was about to shoot him.
The body was found around the cor
ner of the house about forty feet
from the scene of the shooting by
the Sheriff on his arrival, and be
side it was a shot gun.
After the Coroner's inquest, Mr.
Sutton's body was removed to his
own home and burial took place in
the Lancaster Cemetery Tuesday.

uent, mrs. j. s. uaughman. "This
was supplemented by a very fitting
talks from two of our pastors, Drs.
Early and Welburn. Dr. Early
struck the keynote when he told the
mothers present, that a reform in
dress, for their girls was as much a
necessity, if a high standard of mo
rality was to be maintained, as a re
form from intoxicating liquors. The
object of these meeting is to bring
the mothers in closer touch with the
work the W. C. T. U. is trying to do
for the protection of their boys and
girls. Parents are urged to sign the
"Total Abstinence Pledge," and to
teach it to their children in youth
and thus save themselves many
heart-aches for their old days. At
the conclusion of the program a so
cial time was enjoyed, during which
frappe and wafers were served.
