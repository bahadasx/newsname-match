Drug Prescription
Case Before Court
G. B. Ashley Tests Legality of Pro
hibition On Refilling Pre
scriptions. .
Suit to cancel the Treasury regula
tion that prohibits the refilling of
prescriptions containing small per
centages of drugs was Instituted In
the District Supreme Court today by
George B. Ashley,
The petitioner, declares he Is unable
to pay a physician's fee for the re
writing of a prescription each time
he desires It filled, and he asserts that
greatly to the detriment of his health
he has been compelled to purchase a
stock preparation.
The action grows out of a' regulation,
made by William H. Osborn, commis
sioner of Internal revenue, and ap
proved by Secretary McAdoo, to ad
minister me Harrison narcotic act.
So-called patent medicines, contain
ing similar amounts of the prohibited
drugs. Mr. Ashley declares, are not
affected by the regulation.
The petition, which asks a writ of
mandamus commanding the cancella
tion of the regulation, was (lied
through Attorneys Eugene- C. Brok
meyer and Leonard J. Mather. Com
missioner Osborn and Secretary Mc
Adoo arc' required to answer October
8., In a rule Issued by Justice McCoy.
RDFIELD DENIES HE
WILL QUIT CABINET
Report Says Commerce Secretary
Will Head Tariff Board.
Revival of the rumor that Secretary
Redfleld Is to leave the Cabinet has
cauacu a uur in wasnington. Tne re
port now Is that he will leave the
Cabinet and become head of the new
tariff commission.
Secretary Redfleld, who Is out of the
city, has entered a denial of the story.
The assertion Is made that the Ad
ministration would be glad to get a new
Secretary of Commerce, and to get rid
of Mr. Redfleld by giving him another
position.
The life of the tariff commission In
any event Is an uncertain quantity. The
opposition to It' In Congress held Its ap
propriation down to one year. If the
Democrats win the next election, many
expect an effort will be mnde to kill
the commission, simply by refusing to
allow It the needed funds.
