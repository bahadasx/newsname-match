TELLS STRANGE TALE OF MIS
TREATMENT OF MEXICANS.

Mexicans Forced Off By American
Land Owners Resent Treatment,
Which He Says Little Better Than
Slavery. Some Are Shot Down.
Omaha, Neb., Sept. 15. ''From my
observations and conversation with
army officers and others on the bor
der, I am convinced that most of the
! trouble originated on tnis side of the
border," Rev. John P. roucher, cap
tain and adjutant of the Fourth Ne
braska infantry, who ts home on a
furlough, said.
The trouble is mostly over wages
and the treatment of Mexican labor
ers by the land owners on the Amer
ican side, said the minister. This
I land was formerly Mexican territory
and the Mexican, who has been forced
off, resents the treatment which they
say is little better than slavery, and
when they revolt they are shot down.

Insanity in Ireland Decreases.
Dublin, Ireland, SepL 13. Insanity
in Ireland has lately shown a de
crease, chiefly among women. This
is something new, as Ireland's statis
tics for insanity have always been
unusually high. The superintendent
of the asylum at Delfast declares the
I reason for the decrease is due en
tirely to the Improved standard of
living ami to the restrictions on the
liquor traffic. Many people who lived
in poverty, are now in comparative
luxury. There are, he declares, solid
grounds for the hope that, especially
among women, Ireland will witness a
great diminution of neurotic disor

NEWSPAPERS MUST RAISE PRICE
Mills Continue to Raise Prices and
Printers Face Serious Situation,
Kansas City, Mo., Sept. 15 Higher
prices for subscriptions and for ad.
vortlsing lit the newspaper field were
advocated here yesterday by J. P.
Fowell, Instructor In advertising of
the School of Journalism of tho Uni
versity of Missouri, at Columbia. Ho
was speaking at the annual meeting
of the Missouri Press Association.
"The newspaper puBlIsher who does
not Increaso his subscription price
and his advertising rates In common
with the upward trend of prices for
practically all commodities that enter
into the production or a newspaper,
Is quite likely to be facing ruin In
another year," he said. Then lie
quoted figures tending to show that
almost every article nsed In newspa
per production has cither doubled or
quadrupled In the last year.
He said that not more than a dozen
leading newspapers in tho country,
however, had Increased their prices
and that he had heard of none at all
In the country field that had done so,
Mr. Powell also discussed the rela
tion of the advertiser and the Euro-'
pean war.
"We are living In a time of war and
we should prepare for peace," he said.
"Some day the war will end. It may
be soon; It may be late; but from now
until peace Is declared, business men
have an opportunity to Insure their
business against the future by adver
tising. The retailer especially should
entrench himself with such service
and advertising that he will be able
to hold his customers against the In
evitable bargain and liquidations that
are certain to follow this artificially
produced prosperity."
Mr. Powell said that an Increase In
advertising rates would be a benefit
to the public because tt would tend
to eliminate "adventurers with little
capital, who, unknown to the average
publisher, seek to exploit questiona
ble merchandise through newspaper
advertising," and tbit It would cair
more faith to be placed In the an
nouncements of reputable firms.
