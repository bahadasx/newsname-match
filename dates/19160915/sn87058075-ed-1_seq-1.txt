In her visits during the first week of
school, the county superintendent has
found more repairs in the school houses,
and more clean school houses than in
any of her previous fall visits. She has
found that it was almost dangerous to
make the statement that was made
last week, that any one school house is
the cleanest in the county. She is now
looking forward with interest to find

whether she was mistaken in thinking
that only one is scrubbed regularly
throughout the year. Paris Township
now has three schools supplied with the
Waterman-Waterbury heating and ven
tilating systems. Other school boards
should see them.
Manly Pecoy Attempts Suicide.
Wednesday forenoon Manly Pecoy
came over town and surrendered him
self to the Sheriff and asked to be lock
ed up as he feared he was insane. The
various members of the Insane Com
mission lookf him over and decided,
that he was not insane but in a badly
run down physical condition and very
nervous, having been unable to sleep
recently. No information was filed
against Pecoy and as his family de
cided to take him on the evening train
to Dubuque for treatment at a private
sanitarium, he was given to the cus
tody of his family to prepare him for
the trip. While engaged in making
his arrangements, Pecoy went to his
room and cut his throat and right wrist
with a razor. His wife summoned aid
and Pecoy was taken to the hospital
where it was found that the slash in
his throat had severed only the small
jugular vein and that he was in not
a very serious condition. Yesterday
morning, an information of insanity
was filed by a member of his family,
and he will be taken to Independence
as soon as his condition will permit,
probably in about the first of next
week.
Several months ago, Pecoy suffered
a severe attack of rheumatism and Jhas
run down from 220 to about 140 pounds
in weight, with consequent worrying
over his condition and inability to work.
Fish For Stream Near Cresco.
Through the efforts of N. B. Wheeler,
there will be a car load or more of
game fish distributed in the Turkey
and Iowa Rivers. Alao a fine lot of
trout for Cold water and other streams
near the Iowa River.
Now, Bro. Fishermen, give these
fish a chance to grow, and use every
effort to stop the seining of fish, and
we will soon have some sport with rod
and reel. N. B. WHEELER.

Old Settlers Will Heed the Waning
The people, especially the old set
tiers of Cresco and vicinity, havs
received a warning of the approach of
a terrible epidemic which is soon to
hurl itself against our community.
From neighboring towns comes tho
awful news that the dread disease haa
worked havoc in their midst. Doc
tors have declared the malady to bo
incurable and it was with fear and
trembling that the Howard Coun
ty Burglar association met in secret
session and decided that the only way
to prevent this great affliction was to
be prepared. After many hours of
deliberation, it was unanimously de
cided that the only preventative and
sole cure of Old Age was to perpetu
ate and rejuvenate our Old Settlers,
annual reunion. Owing to the fact
that the young people in a few years
will be susceptible to this malady, It
was deemed advisable to incorporate
a plank of preparedness and invito
everyone, young and old, to the next
and best meeting, to be held oa Thurs
day, Sept. 21st, at Bents's grove in
Cresco. The committee has arranged
a program exceptionally educational
as well as entertaining. Hughes and
Wilson cannot be present, but local
political leaders will furnish the gas.
Each family is requested to bring a
basket well filled with the necessar
ries of life and good digestion. Every
one invited. Come and be young
again and always.
