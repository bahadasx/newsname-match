According to a statement given out

on t!ir enforcement of law in Mexico

! plained that under the l?iaz regime tlie
[judicial proceedure was so cumbersome
land expensive ami the judiciary so cor
rupt that it was impossible for a poor
I man to obtain Justice.
A* soon as the plan for the revision
of the Constitution has been car tied

tion. a thorough-mollis reform will be
undertaken in order to make the laws
conform to the new standards of justice
to be incorporated in the Constitution.
The Mexican commissioners- empha
sized the. fact that the Carranza gov

the guarantees to civil rights, although
the present abnormal condition of the
country Ii a s made it necessary to sus
pend the constitutional guarantee in
