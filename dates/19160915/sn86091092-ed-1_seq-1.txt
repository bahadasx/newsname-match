CALDWELL TRIBUNE, FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 15, 1916.
WEEKLY, $2.00 PER YEAR
FIRST FASHION SHOWIIN
CALDWELL WAS
GREAT SUCCESS
LATEST THING IN LADIES
SUITS, CLOAKS AND MILLI
NERY SHOWN BY ENTER
PRISING BUSINESS FIRMS
AT HUREE THEATRE
Oakes Bros., Caldwell Dry Goods
Company, Mrs. Gilgian-Sarchet and
Miss Walling Contribute to Show—
Assistance Rendered by Huree
Theatre, Colonial and Palm—Big
Attendance Both Evenings—Beauti
ful Models Show Gowns.
Once again Caldwell has broken
into the metropolitan ring, this time
by putting on a real, up-to-date style
show with a full program of fashion
movies and some novel extras thrown
in for good measure. That this meth
od of enlisting the interest of the pub
lic in the variety and smartness of
Caldwell's ready-to-wear clothing was
successful was .proven by the capacity
houses which greeted the two even
ings' performances at the Huree,
Monday and Tuesday of this week.
Oakes' Millinery and Suit Depart
ments, the Caldwell Dry Goods Co.,
The Vogue, and Mrs. Gilgan
Sarchet's Millinery were the chief
demonstrators, and the fact that
the models were all representative,
well known Caldwell ladies added in
terest to the show and brought out an
enthusiastic following of admirers for
each.
The fashion parade began at 9
O'clock, being the meat in a movie
sandwich, bounded on either side by
photoplays which began at the usual
time—7:30, and closed at 10 o'clock
plus.
The eight models began their
promenade in natty street costumes,
the firms alternating in their displays.
Smart 'boots and hats either harmon
izing or contrasting with the general
color scheme of the costume, every
smallest detail of feminine good dress
ing was emphasized with a deliberate
ness and grace which threatened to
divert the attention of the audience
from the apparel to the wearers.
Pronounced Special Features.
The newest fall and winter street
suits showed some pronounced special
features in common. The skirts meet
the high boots in sensible, comfortable
walking length, and the fullness is
effected either by flare cut or by a
skillful arrangements of pleats. The
jackets ar e decidely longer than last
year's wear, and either close or semi
fitting, and show a wide variety in the
shape of collars and cuffs. Plain cloth
in dark, rich colors seems to hold a
decided preference over mixtures in
rough textures so popular last season,
though some charming models in the
latter class were shown.
- The suit display was followed by
coats for winter wear—coats of every
cut, cloth and color found in the most
exclusive fashion catalogues of the far
east. The garments are real winter
comfort givers, being almost skirt
length, with wide, high, close fitting
collars, with a generous flare to the
skirt, the fullness being sometimes
confined by a belt, while on other
models its long lines were undis
turbed.
Millinery Crowns Model.
Each costume was climaxed by a
hat in keeping with its purpose and
general tone. While the turban^ atul
close fitting head ornament is still in
good form for street wear, a decided
preference was shown for the larger
shapes, many of them of the picture
variety. Velvet covered shapes in the
dark, rich shades, with a decided pref
erence for metal lace garniture is ihe
proper thing in trimmings which are a
scanty feature of the season's foibles
in millinery.
One of the extras shown in coat
dom wa s a genuine Hudson seal-skin,
a garment from the (îordon-1" erguson
Co., of St. Paul, sent at the request of
Oakes Bros., in connection with their
regular shipment of furs especially for
the style show. '1 he coat was a shim
mering length of elegance, cut on the
simplest lines with no attempt at or
namentation and no need for it. 1 he
lining was of rich brocaded satin in
heliotrope, and this cunlor note was
prettily accentuated in the trimmings
on the wide black velvet hat. $1650.00
was casually named as the invoice
price. No bide were made on the
garment.
The array of afternoon ant! evening
gowns was as bewildering as it was
pretty. The princess is still a favorite
style. Drapes, panniers, tunics and a
general fullness mark the skirts, while
the bodices are close fitting, collars
flare widely and sleeves manifest a
disposition to do as they please in
length and cut. Among these charm
ing creations space can be given to
but two special descriptions. Oakes
Bros, showed a dainty evening gown
in pate blue messalinc with close fit
ting bodice and full skirt with tunic
of tulle edged with ribbon a shade
darker than the body of the gown.
The hoop effect in the tunic was
marked by the introduction of tiny
pink roses at stated intervals. A large
picture hat in black added the needed
contrast. One of the prettiest of the
Caldwell Dry Goods Co.'s gowns was
be
or
ern
the
in',
of
a
one tu snen pinK uius uv nv,..«..-.
Both the fancy blouse and the pan-1
niered skirt had a charming color note
I in the bead garniture. With the gown
were worn a white fox set atul a wide
white hat' with silver trimmings.
Charming Models.
The ladies serving, as models were
the Misses Helen Stone and Elizabeth
O'Connor and Mesdames Hazel Petrie
and Cecil Hay Payne, the Misses Lucy
Oakes, Florence Hoffman, Lucy Mc
Kce and Mrs. Hoffman.
Earl Boyes established an undying
reputation as the funny man at the
first evening's performance, and the
Colonial passed some delectable
sweets between acts, while Tuesday
evening's audience was regaled with
ice cream and chocolates by the Palm.
Taken as a whole, Caldwell's first
fashion show was a decided success.
WESTERN PACIFIC WILL
BUILD IN SPRING
President Levey Makes Definite An
nouncement of Plans.
President Levey of the Western
Pacific Railway company lias definite
ly announced that his railroad will
commence building branches and ex
tensions in the spring. The financial
affairs of the road have been straight
tned out and the long contemplated
improvements will be made.
The Western Pacific contemplates
branch lines into Idaho. One of these
lines, the Winnemucca Northern, will
be built from Winnemucca to Cald
well. Another is from Wells to Twin
Falls and possibly on 1 to Idaho Falls
or a point in that section. The West
ern Pacific plans provide for the ex
penditure of $20,0(X),000 in new rail
road construction work.
Plan of Bush Will Carry.
The original plans of President
Benj. Rush, which were stopped by
the Gould interests refusing to join
in', will be carried out, so far as branch
lines are concerned, according to the
best railroad authority. President
Rush made the trip over the proposed
Winnemucca Northern and was well
pleased. The line is of easy construc
tion, and would open up a magnificent
country.
DIRECTORS WATER USERS
MEET IN MONTHLY SESSION
Routine Business Transacted at Sep
tember Meeting of Board.
The board of directors of the Boise
Water Users' association held its
regular monthly meeting Tuesday af
ternoon. The regular routine busi
ness was transacted. After the trans
action of the usual business discussing
of seepage problems ensued. The em
ployment of counsel to look into the
cost of water on the Boise project
was mentioned but no divulgance oi
the progress or plan was made.
The question of power leases on the
project came up for incidental con
sideration through the reading of a
letter from F. E. Weymouth, now su
pervising all government projects. In
order to arrive at an estimate of the
power possibilities at Arrowrock, Mr.
Weymouth had t been asked by the di
rectors for a copy of a certain report
on this matter. He replied by citing
a number of reports covering this
matter.
Because of reports received by the
directors to the effect that Basques
were grazing sheep on ditch banks in
proximity to the Deer Flat reservoir,
the secretary was delegated to ask the
county sheriff to act in the matter. In
fringement of the two-mile law is al
leged.
Water Off October 15th.
By passage of two resolutions the
time of shutting off government
water for irrigation purposes was fix
ed as October 15, and the time during
which all water may be turned off,
at the discretion of Project Manager
Cole, was limited to the period be
tween December 1 and February 15.
It is possible that little or no water
for stock purposes will be furnished
in any districts this winter.
S. F. Kesl. a resident on the south
fork of the Boise river above Arrow
rock, appeared to request aid in con
struction of a road, the impounded
waters having marooned his_ farm
Manager ( ole was asked to investi
gate and report on this demand.

Camp Stephen Little, Nogales, Ari
zona, Sunday Sept. 10, 1916.—We have
again met the enemy and—they are
ours.
Saturday the Second Idaho met the
Connecticut regiments, reinforced on
their way home from For Huachuca.
The result of the manuevers was such
:t decisive victory for Idaho that eve<n
the Conn, men are satisfied they were
beaten.
Late Friday we left camp for the
pumping station, some 7'/j miles, on
the Santa Cruz river. The night was |
so perfect that scarcely a "pup'' tent
was put up. At 3:30 a. m. first call
sounded and the regiment started
forward to intercept the "enemy."
The problem was very interesting
from a military standpoint, though the
work was hard. The country is more
hilly th'an Idaho—and simply one
huge mass of more or less disinte
grated rock.
The boys were paid Friday before
leaving and are yet pretty busy
settling debts and making purchases.
Naturally some money is spent fool
ishly, but the vast majority of it goes
out in perfectly legitimate channels.
Ma.ny of the stories appearing in
various "home" papers are amusing—
and some aggrevatingly misleading.
The boys here are the same boys that
left Idaho two months ago—sobered
somewhat by a discipline more strict
than that to which they were accus
tomed—but they are the same
honest, clean-hearteid lads and have to
stay that way. There is small oppor
tunity for anything else. The work
is fairly hard and exacting. There
are no excuses accepted for the most
trivial dereliction in duty and to make
good it is necessary to keep in the
nk of condition all the time.
No Salt Needed.
Probably many of our friends take
the stories of the prowness and gen
eral efficiency of the Second Idaho
ith a grain or two of sail. A day in
headquarters wtould convince the most
skeptical. Those high in authority are
ery kind to the Second Idaho in all
memorandums" and official reports
nly a few days since some of the
officers of the 2th regiment stationed
here for the past two years, were dis
cussing the possibility of getting some
organization to relieve them;—they
aving grown tired of remaining so
long in one post on "temporary" ser
ice. They could not think of any
organization available. One of them
suddenly exclaimed, "Why, what's the
atter with that Idaho regiment re
lieving us?" Put up to the colonel in
command, he considered the matter
for a few minutes and then said.
That might be possible. They are
able to do it."
Perhaps a copv, verbatim, of a letter
from General Plummer, will be of in
terest to the readers of The Tribune,
t follows:
Headquarters Nogales District.
Camp te.phen Little. Nogales, Ari
zona, September 6, 1916.—From the
District Adjutant, to the Commanding
Officer. 2nd Idaho Infantry. Subject,
nspection of Troops.
1. The following extracts from the
cport of the District Inspector, in his
recent inspection of the N'atiomal
Guard organizations, is furnished for
your information.
March discipline poor, except in
the Idaho regiment.
"6. The march discioline of the
Idaho regiment was excellent. On the
day I was with it, and it was a particul
arly hot, trying day, this regiment
arried packs, marched fifteen miles.
Columns were closed up, no unneces
sary noise, no straggling, apparently
no feet sore or weary, and not a sin
r ,, ... v
gle man fell out.
2. The District Commander is j
y pleased with the favorable re
greatly plea
port made by the Inspector on this
feature of your training.
By command of Brigadier General
Plummer.
J. T. DEAN.
Lieut. Col. Adjutant General.
To one conversant with the paucity
of commendation emanating from
those "higher up," this letter is sig
nificant. Even though the report was
favorable to the Idaho regiment, it
indicates unusual friendship and re
gard for a man buried under an ocean
of detail, as is General Plummer, to
give his time and attention to the
writing of such a letter.
Officers Busy.
The officers are now busy with a
course in map reading. Soon it will
be engineering.
Each week now the regiment <in
joys, company by company, combat
exericsc with the 2th regiment. This
is another instance of the favor In
which our regiment is held—and much
of our efficiency, if such we have, is
due to the untiring efforts of our in
structor, Capt. Dannemiller.
Busy as we are, "home" is ever
present in the thoughts of the boys.
Reports of our being sent home soon
are circulated every day—"latrine
rumors" as they are called. Little
credence is placed in them. If one is
to believe the people living in this sec
tion—-both sides of the border—the
danger is just as great now as It ever
was. The general concensus of opin
ion is, once withdraw the troops—the
show of power—and the raids will be
resumed with increased savagery.
Meantime mustaches are growing—
beards, too. Slowly the boys are be
coming better soldiers, and that means
I better citizens in every way.
the North and Soutfh Idaho State
Highway association, whose head
quarters are at Lewiston. Mr. Gib
bons is authorized to appoint county
directors of the association.
The association will hold a meeting
early in October at Lewiston when
plans will be discussed and adopted
for the construction of the proposed
highway connecting north and south
Idaho.
ATTENDANCE REACHES
HIGHEST MARK
High School Teachers in Distress
From Excessive Enrollment.
lcalu wlc lla _,
I ÔT'Vhe'âtbîe^rfanrarëTecVming* en
1 -
The opening of the school year
brings to Caldwell an unusual number
of new students. Against an enroll
ment of 235 in the high school last
year there is at present an enrollment
of 265 at the close of the third day of
school.
The opening enrollment in the Lin
coln building was 243 last year, while
it is 293 this year.
The enrollment at the Washington
building was 238 last year and it is
now 277.
The enrollment at the Van Buren
this year is 109 against 103 last year,
The total enrollment for the city
this year is 944 against 819 of last
year, showing an increase of 125.
With 175 seats in the assembly room
in the high school and an enrollment
of 265, the faculty are facing a very
serious problem of being able to
handle the situation. At the present
time two class rooms have been filled
with desks and these are all occupied
with two students sitting in some of
them. Arrangements are being made
to fill another one of the class room
with desks at once in order to handle
the over-flow from the assembly
room.
Prospects for Football Promising.
The prospects for a good football
team are very interesting in view of
the fact that none of t'he first team
players of last year are in attendance
nt the school. Predictions were made
that Caldwell would be rather deficient
in this line of athletics, but with the
incoming of several new men who
seem to be excellent timber for the
team, the aspect has changed, and all
couraged. At last evening's practice
Coach Houghton was able to unearth
several new men who appear to_ be
embryonic stars. Considerable time
has been spent in teaching the boy
how to handle themselves in blocking
and tackling. Coach Hougton being a
member of one of the University of
Iowa's strongest football teams, is ex
ceedingly capable in demonstrating
the tricks of the game himself. At
the present time there are about 24
boys in the football squad.

As stated in the last issue of The
Tribune, Judge Will R. King, chief
counsel of the Reclamation Service,
is in the west, visiting the government
reclamation projects. Judge King
will visit the Boise project at an early
date. While here he wishes to meet
the members of the boards of direc
tors of the irrgation districts, canal
companies and the waters users' as
sociation.
We stated last week that Judge
King had given out an interview at
Salt Lake dealing with matters of in
terest to settlers on government
reclamation projects. In this inter
view the position of the Reclamation
Service is set forth at length. Think
ing that the matter discussed, and the
viewpoint of Judge King and asso
ciates in the Reclamation Service are
of interest to the readers of The Tri
bune we give the interview in full as
it was published in the Salt Lake
Tribune of September 3rd.
"I aj^again in Salt Lake City, not
only in the interest of my employers,
the government, but with the interests
of the farmers of this section near to
my heart," said Judge Will R. King,
chief counsel of the United States
reclamation service, at the Hotel Utah
last night.
"I desire very much to get the recla
mation projects away from the private
corporation idea, known as the water
users' associations, to that of irriga
tion districts. The reclamation pro
jects in the state of Utah are on the
best 'basis of any that I know of in
the sixteen arid states when It comes
to the question of organization, but
they can be materially improved by
substituting in place of the present
plan what is known as the irrigation
district system. Especially is this the
case with reference to what is known
as the high-line system. Under this
system there are several million acres
of government land. These govern
ment lands, as will appear by what I
will subsequently say, will reduce the
cost per acre to the project very ma
terially."
Tremendous Investment.
Judge King further stated that the
government had invested $125,000,000
in irrigation projects. He continued:
There is thrust upon the reclama
tion commission the burden of not
only making this investment, but pro
viding for its return. In any other
department of the government the
money is expended and told "good
by," but in this particular service it
is expected to be returned; hence the
best method of providing for the ex
penditure of the money and at the
same time returning it is one of the
unusual responsibilities which is
thrust upon this commission.
A good many people, without fully
considering the situation, think that
because millions may be spent in the
improvement of, we will say, rivers
and harbors, in which, when the
money is expended, is not expected to
return- in dollars and cents, so far as
those in that particular neighborhood
may be concerned, assume that the
same rule should apply to expendi
tures for reclamation work, but in this
a very important feature is over
looked, and while money may be ex
pended in the improvement of rivers
and harbors, the boats of anyone
might float over them, 'but when ex
pended in the reclamation of arid
lands, and the giving of the title to
a home builder, he alone has abso
lute control over that particular
property.
Personal Property.
In other words, he is the monarch
of all he surveys. It is his personal
property, which the government, as
his agent, has enabled him to reclaim,
while, in the other instance, it is pub
lic property, in which every city of the
United States, and to some extent
the citizens of the entire world, have
a right. . .
The irrigation district system with
reference to United States reclama
tion projects is in use on reclamatoin
projects in Washington, Idaho and
Nebraska. Its advantages over what
is known as the "water users' asso
ciation" system are Iby experience
clearly demonstrated not only from
the standpoint of efficiency, but of
economy as well.
The advisability of adopting the
irrigation district plan in place of the
water users' system has been ma
terially increased by passage of house
bill No 12365, known as the Smith
bill. This bill brings the reclamation
service of the government in full har
mony with the irrigation district plan.
