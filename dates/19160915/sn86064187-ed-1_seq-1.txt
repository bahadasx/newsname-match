made to Enworth by the company.
The hooks of the university were
subjected to a minute examination on

Water Superintendent Jolted;

We'll have it low and quiet on the

"listen to reason" when a motorcop says
a man speeded and the defendant ad
mits he tore the entt-tlur of. the speed
regulations.
The good old days when the judge
said "one dollar and costs." and the
speeders grinned and paid their little
old two dollars, are gone. The speed
er who goes to face trial now better
have a bankroll with him. A lawyer
won't do any good.
J. . Bennett, superintendent of the
city water department, led the proces

PRESIDENT WILL
ANSWER HUGHES
ON RAILWAY DILL
Anxious to Meet Republicans
on Issue.
LONG REACH. N. Y., Sept. 15
President Wilson decided today to chal
lenge the statement made by Charles
Evans Hughes in recent speeches that
the basis for settlement of the rail
road strike which was averted was
merely an increase of wages for the
employes. The president, his political
adviser said today, considers the prin
ciple of the eight hour day practical
ly acknowledged by the strike settle
ment and will eek to show that while
the railroad eight-hour bill as passed
by congress to meet the situation will
give employe at least a temporary
increase in pay, the more important
fact is that it establishes the eight
hour day as the basis of work for rail
road working men.
The president will make known his
views either in a speech at Shadow
Lawn, or in a letted. Democratic lead
ers expect the republicans to continue
their effort to make the strike an issue
and it was taid today that Mr. Wil
son will welcome uch an argument.

Scores of curiosity seekers, hearing
of these two stranne. visitors, went to
Packingtown today to see the two

other youngsters from the farm of Rov
Hutto in Beckham county. It is three
months old. It has two perfectly formed
feetonearh leg. Picklers at the pack
eries were lamenting that all pigs were
not thus equipped. Think of the pickled
pigs' feet that could be had. Twice
as many feet with the same number
of pigs.
The freaky sheep, jts lone horn giv
ing it the appearance of a unicorn,
was just like the other sheep save that
it did not have a pair of horns
