San Francisco, Sept. 2, 191(5.
Mr. Robert W. Cole,
Barbourville, Ky.
My Dear Robert:
1 am here on a membership
campaign for the San Francisco
Chamber of Commerce.
Our first day's work of mem
bership committees resulted ir.
1270 members, the largest num
ber of additional memberships
ever obtained in a single day for
a chamber of commerce. This
adds about $50,000 new income
to the $90,000 income heretofore
from about 2400 old members.
In other words we gave them
in one day more than fifty per
cent gain both in membership
and in money income.
The second days's total was
1282 new memberships or a total
for two days of 2552, which more
than doubled the membership.
The third day's effort produced
1044. and the fourth day pro
duced 1208, or a total for the
four days of 4808. This gives
this organization the hirgest
membership of any like organiza
tion in the world.
There are two classes of mem
bership, Class A at $G0, and
Class B at $30. It is estimated
that more than fifty per cent ot
the new memberships are for
Class A.
Yours very truly,
Lewis D. Sampson.

AMONG THE NATIONAL LEADERS
Washington. Sept. 14. The
Hon. Dick T. Morgan, Republi
can representative from Okla
homa, speaking to a group of his
colleagues, points out how the
Wilson administration handed it
to the farmers, in the following
words: "Now the 8,000,000 of
men who are employed in our
manufacturing establishments
are vitally interested that their
products shall have a market
wherein they can be sold at
reasonable prices. The 6,500,000
farmers are interested in having
a market wherein their products
will sell at good prices. Neither
those who prudiice manufactured
articles nor those who produce
farm products can be benefitted
by sunendering a part of their
home market their best market
to foreign producers. But this
is what the Underwood bill com
pelled them to do. The Under
wood tariff law put cattle, hogs,
sheep, corn, broom corn, wheat,
rye, potatoes, milk, eggs, all
kinds of meat, wool, wheat
(lour bread, and other products
of the farm on the free list. Be
fore the European war began
large importations of the above
products were beginning to ar
rive, and when it ends there will
be a great flood of importations
and the American farmer will be
brought into direct competition
with the markets of the world."
A newspaper that is non-political
says that we are exporting
goods to the value of $2,00,000
per day to Russia, and that a
considerable part of this is not
munitions. In the list of things
that are classed as not war
material we find wire, which is
used for making barricade;
saddles, which every army must
have; automobiles which are a
chief means of transportation of
food and other supplies, railway j
track and equipment, which is
the very thing Russia most needs
in order to make her lines of
communication usable. As a
matter of fact, practically all the
$2,000,000 per day is war
material.
Representative Fess, of Ohio,
one of the great orators of the
House, in speaking of the Re
publican policy said to a group
of colleagues: "The Republican
idea is to build up and maintain
the home market. That meanB
to bring the agriculturist, the
manufacturer, the miner, and
the exchange man all into close
cooperation. It proceeds upon
the theory that what will aid the
one will not hurt the other. It
means to make possible the pro
ducer by making possible the
consumer. It invests capital in
order to employ labor. In this
way what helps the consumer
will not hurt the producer."
Senator Penrose, of Penn
sylvania, flayed the administra
tion mercilessly on its debauchery
of the civil service in the Senate
recently. He pointed out that
since civil service was establish
ed, there had never been any
such wilful violations of the law,
and that with all its protestations
of sincerity on this Bubject, the
Democratic party had been the
most wanton and hypocritical in
its administration of the statute.
Ho pointed out that the Presi
dent himself had waived the law
on more appointments than any
chief executive who had evr
sat in the White Hew
"The workingmen of this coun
try are not going to be fooled by
the present fictitious prosperity,"
said Congressman T. S. Williams
of Illinois. They know that la
bor conditions in this country are
abnormal at the present time and
that everywhere that mills and
factories are running, it is al
most invariably directly trace
able to the European war. The
workingmen of this country, like
all other patriotic Americans, are
looking to the future. They
know that the Republican party
is their only hope."
Representative Gillett, of
Massachusetts, has nettled the
postmaster general with his
speech made on the floor of the
House, in which he pointed out
the raid made on the rural
carriers by the present adminis
tration. He stated that through
a proposition to motorize the
routes, hundreds of old carriers,
under civil service, had been
thrown out of jobs and their
places filled by Democrats and
that this branch of the postal
service had been demoralized, its
efficiency greatly impaired, by
this return to the spoils system.
Never was the inefficiency of
a party better illustrated than in
the bungling, extravagant, dilly
dallying, quarreling and bicker
ing session of Congress recently
brought to a close. If ever
Democracy demonstrated its un
fitness to run the affairs of the
country it has during the past
nine months.
A few years ago, when he was
not a candidate for office, but
instructing young men who
would go out into the world and
take leadership in business and
politics, Woodrow Wilson de
nounced labor unions and said
that the usual standard of the
employee in our day is "to give
as little as may be for his
wages." When he became a
candidate for office he changed
his line of talk, whether he
changed his real views or not.
It will be interesting to see what
Wilson will be sayinjr on the la
bor union question after he has
been retired to private life once
more and is again free to say
what he thinks.
In a time of stringent blockade
bv the Allies. Germain- sonr ;i
, ... j
submarine freighter to this coun-1
try witn a cargo ot dyes. She
sold them in a ready market at
fabulous prices. What will she
not do when the blockade has
been removed by the peace agree
ment and with no protectee
tariff to preserve our markets
for "Americans first."
President Wilson was at least
frank on one issue -he made it
perfectly plain that he is ever
lastingly opposed to the principle
of a protective tariff, thouirh of
course he may change his mind
before election.
Herbert Quick, recently ap
pointed a member of the Rural
Credits Board, wants the United
States to do something that will
cause the Mexican people to look
upon us as a "comforter of na
tions". Well, so far as Mexico is
concerned, didn't wo supply her
with ammunition, let her enjoy
the sport of killing our people,
and acquiesce in ever request
or demand made b either her
de facto rulers or her bandits'.'
What could Mexico ask that we
have not yielded?
President Wilson has again
proclaimed his opposition to a
l protective tariff, but his theories,
growing out of lack of experience
in business, will have little
weight with the hundreds of
thousands of producers of this
country who have felt the de
pressing influence of competition
with the products of cheap labor
in Europe and Asia. President
Wilson may declaim from now
until election but he can't con
vince or persuade the pearl but
ton manufacturers of Iowa, Illi
nois, Missouri, Arkansas, and
other states, who saw their in
dustry nearly ruined by imports
of buttons made in Germany
from American shells. Neither
can he convince the best of cane
sugar producers who faced bank
ruptcy until the outbreak of the
war. Nor can he convince the
Pacific Coast lumbermen who
saw Canadian shingles put on
the roofs of American houses
while their own mills were stand
ing idle. Likewise w!1' ho be
unable to pc- ' 't i
ducers of the middle u-,t who
saw Argentine corn sold in Illi
nois in competition with the
Illinois crop. One ounce of ex
perience is worth tons of theory.
Killed by Train.
Last Saturday morning Coroner
Dozier was called to Himyar
where he found a colored man,
w ho is unknou n, terribly cut up
by the train. He was o mangled
that he could not be recognized,
and no one has as yet been able
to find out anything at all about
him. The only thing that would
bring any light to his identifica
tion is that he had the picture of
a woman tattoed upon his left
arm and the letters "F. G. R."
He also had several scars i.i his
breast.
Coroner Dozier picked up the
remains and held an inquest over
them, and the railroad company
had a passenger tram stop at
Himyar and bring them to this
city. As there could be nothing
found out as to who he was the
remains were buried Sunday in
the cemetery just across the
Richland bridge.
