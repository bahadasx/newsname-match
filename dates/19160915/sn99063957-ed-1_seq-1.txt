Mexico City, Sept. 13. Mexico is
about to resume her place among t'.ic
repuoncs or tne western hemisphere
after four years of revolutionary dis
turbances. A -decree issued by General Carranza
on the eve of the celebration of the
anniversary of Mexican independence
prepares the way for the present de
facto government to be replaced by a
substantial constitutional government.
The decree calls for a revision of sev
eral articles of the Plan of Guadalupe,
drawn np on December 12, 1014, and
makes provision for the election of
members of a national congress. An
other decree will be issued tomorrow,
calling for the election of a constitu
tional congress on October 25. The
first session of the new congress will
be November 20, probably at Coyoacan
a suburb of Mexico City.
The decree issued last night provides
that each state and territory shall elect
a deputy to congress and a sub-deputy
for every 70,000 inhabitants, and an
additioaal deputy if the fraction above
70,000 exceeds two sevenths of that
number. Any state or territory not
having 70,000 -i. habitants is entitled to
elect a deputy and sub-deputy also. -
The eligibility requirements are the
same as those provided in the election
of 1857. Those who opposed the consti
tutional government with arms will be
ineligible to hold office.

By Webb C. Miller
(I'nited Press staff correspondent)
F.l Paso, Texas, Sept. 15. That ten
tative plans are under wnv for with
drawal of the national guard from the
border was revealed today when tele
grams from Washington reached every
guard commander asKiug how many
tourist and stock cars would be neces
sary to transport troops back to their
respective state mobilization camps.
Guard officers today are making up
reports of the number of cars needed
to carry each organization.
As the report of receipt of telegrams
spread over the militia camps hern it
caused a buzz of excitement among of
ficers who believe it forecasts an early
withdrawal of the guardsmen.
Armv ouicinls at headquarters, how
ever, pointed out that the actual with
drawal may be weeks or months dis
tant as this is only the first move.
After the homeward movement begins
it will consume several weeks as the
transportation to their home stntes of
one hundred thousand troops, with lim
ited trackage, is a huge problem.

New York, Sept. 15. The Morgan,

the present boom on tho stock exchange,
according to estimates in Wall street to
day. Steel, oil and motor stocks have
been lenders in the wild rusn of specu

day after another and sent prices to
new high records on many successive
days.
The boom started iu the "Morgan
group" and it is common talk on the
street that a bullish sentiment was de
sired in order to facilitate the flotation
of the recent British loan. As the up
ward movement was getting well under
way, Maine election returns were inject
ed into the situation and a price move
ment followed, described as similar to
the boom which started when first re

at 107 a share yesterday, a figure which
was duplicated today; General Motor
shot upward at a $50 a "day rate to t'.'50
a share and was but slightly under thnt
figure today.

On the curb the various Standard Oil
stocks have been successfully rocket

and Prairie Oil and Gas selling up

other Morgan interest, which, with Uni

has been another of the lenders in the
present movemeut, common selling from
50 cents to 50.75 and preferred from
