ANTI-LYNCH RALLY A SUCCESS.
The anti-lynch rally held at St.
Paul'sA. M. E. church last Monday
evening was a success from every
point of view. A good sized crowd
including some of the leading white
citizens of the city, was in attendance
and the reports from the National Ne
gro Masonic Cnogress, the National
Negro Medical association and the Na
tional Association of Colored Women
were enjoyed by all present, after
whicha collection of $75 was raised
and forwarded to national headquar
ters at New York City as Des Moines'
contribution toward the $10,000 anti
lynching fund subscription which
were to be closed tot'ay.
Some of our citizens refused to con
tribute because of their doubts of the
possibility of accomplishing the ob
ject, namely, the stopping of lynching,
butr egardless of whether this be ac
complished the demonstration of last
Monday evening's meeting resulted in
the appearance on Tuesday of an edi
torial in the Evening Tribune on "The
Negroes of Des Moines," which edi
torial itself has already been the
cause of several dollars being added
to the anti-lynching fund and which
will unquestionably be worth more to
the Negro citizens of this community
than many times the amount of mon
ey contributed by them in the rally.
Negroes of Des Moines
The Negroes of Des Moines last
Monday evening raised a fund of more
than $60 as their part of a general fund
now being raised by Moprfield Story of
Boston, at one time president of the
American Bar association, to fight
southern lynchings with.
Mr. Story has given $1,000 himself
and another Boston sympathizer with
the colored race has given $1,000. Just
what the plan is to be has not been dis
closed, I ut Mr. Story is confident
that lynching can be made unpopular
ev^n in the states where it is now most
frequent
At the meeting last Monday evening
interesting reports were made of the
recent meeting of colored Masons in
Chicago, of the meeting of the Negro
medical association at Kansas City,
and of a recent conf«ernce of Negro
women, all of them well attennsd f»-om
tyes Moines.
Among
o'her thipg the Negroes are
doing, the Negro women of Iowa are
now raising a fund of $&00 to pay for
a painted portrait of Hooker Washing
ton, whicn is to be hung in memorial
hall at the state .pitol, The Dainting
is now in progress in Paris, where the
celebrated Negro inter, lanner, is
putting his best inspiiation into it.
The spirit ot the meeting was that
the
Negro,must
do for himself. He
mustyay
his own way in everything.
He must not rely or the htlp of others,
however gratefully help may be accept
ed.
He
on
must set about laising funds
for everything he ou^ht to do in the
community. He must fight his own
battle, and enjoy the victory when he
wins it.
Two young Negro girls from Des
Moines go to Iowa City this week to
enter the freshman class in the uni»
versity college of liberal arts. The
Negroes are putting great emphasis
education.
The Evening Tribune last winter
asked Mr. Mansnold what class of peo
ple in the city made the least appeal
for help to the humane society. He
answered at once, "The Negroes."

Rev. S. L, Birt
St. Paul's A. M. E. church, Second
and Center streets, under the pastor
ate of Rev. S. L. Birt, is closing one
of the most successful years in the
history of its organization and is en
tering upon a new era of Christian
activities. A happy culmination of a
slow but steady growth under many
pastors and the loyalty of members
and friends.
High churchmen and men of wide
experiences have viewed the ground
and concur in the opinion that the Af
rican M. E. church has a great oppor
tunity in this thriving city, the gate
way to the west. Industrial migration
from the southland has set in. Iowa
will receive her quota. Des Moines,
the capital of the state, will attract
many. Our churches of color must
be on the lookout. Pastor Birt has
net numbers of these men in the
street, at work and has come in con
tact with humanity in all its phases.
As a consequence large crowds have
attended church services 249 acces
sions at regular preaching services,
148 accessions through revival meet
ing. Total number accessions, 397.
The whole burden must not rest on
the pastor. The members have a re
sponsibility, extending awelcome hand,
providing comfort and dispensing
good cheer.
The trustees of the church have had
two financial campaigns this confer
ence year. The first, held in Novem
ber, netted $718 the second, in July
$1,387.
The stewardess board has collected
over $1,800. The Sunday school, A.
C. E., Missionary society and other
auxiliaries of the church have been
very active. The social side has not

EDITOR'S OBSERVATIONS.
This observation letter will cover
our Chicago visit during the great
Masonic conclave, which was recently
held there. We will begin in Des
Moines and motor overland
in
com­
pany with my wife, two children,
Enola and Nelson, and Mrs. Mollie
Watkins. For one who has no auto
mobile knowledge and knew not the
roads, with nothing save automobile
maps, you can to some extent realize
IOW we felt,not knowing how the
weather would be nor the accidents
that might befall us. when our claxton
sounded the start on an 800 mile trip
at 6 o'clock a. m., bidding farewell to
dear old Des Moines, the scenes of my
College schooling and my home during
all of my married life, where my chil
dren were born and raised, leaving our
many strong and beloved relatives and
friends, will indeed cause a person to
enhance thev alue of home sweet
home. Within about two hours we
were at Mrs. Battles' in Colfax,
towa's great health resort. After
spending a few minutes here, again
ve were on our journey. The roads
this place were very bad and
nuddy. Newly worked roads and the
andy roads made traveling difficult,
iowever, we reached Grinnell about
wo hours later and spent about two
lours with our old friend, John A.
Spencer, the cement contractor. After
view of his barn'and cement
yard
md many tools thai he has. He has
just purchased a fi w-passenger auto
mobile and John is
gping
to learn to
run it soon. Mr. R.J3. Craig is an old
citizen. He workef in the Iowa leg
islature. Mrs. R. Redrick is also an
old and respected citizen. She, like
Mr.Craig, owns her own home. We
soon made a dash for Iowa City, but
stopped a few moments for rest and
refreshments. Whilp there we met the
only colored faftiilyf'Mr.v
W:ifl/'M«y«9,-
who has lived there for about forty
years. He is a barber and owns valu
able property. He is improving and
remodeling his property. Two hours
later we entered Iowa City, where is
located our great state university.
This is strictly a college town. The
few colored families here are doing
well. Mrs. H. R. Moore on College
street formerly lived in Des Moines
and is running a first class hair dress
ing parlor and is doing well. J. W.
Thompson is still here and has charge
of a large fraternity frat. Mr. Chas.
Alberts is in the contracting business.
He is doing well and owns a nice
home. Mrs. D. Patterson and L. Dun
negan are here and doing well, also
T. McDavis. Away for Davenport for
the night, a distance of sixty-five
miles. We reached here at 7:30
o'clock, stopping with Mr. and Mrs.
Eugene Green over night and spend
ing the next day here. We left this
town Saturday morning across the
Father of Waters, over the'prairie to
Sterling, where we struck the Lincoln
highway, claimed to be the longest
and finest highway in America. It is
graded up from two to six feet high
and laid with crushed stone, which
makes the surface rough and uneven,
but the most serious objection is
that it is only about twelve to four
teen feet wide, which is entirely too
narrow for large cars to pass orite an
other at a thirty mile speed. Most
teams drive along the side of this
highway. It must be widened and the
surface made smoother. At Sterling
we met a Mr. Clark, one of our sub
scribers, who works at the Elks club.
From here we made Dixon, DeKalb,
Rochelle, Batavia, Wheaton and Chi
cago, the coming metropolis of this
western hemisphere. Here lives more
.it
people in this city than the whole
state of Iowa and about as many col
ored people as there are white people
in Des Moines. The colored people
come near having an equal chance
here than any other
city
in
America.
Here you can view them at their best
and highest civilization. They have
many doctors, many lawyers, many
teachers, many dentists, many musi
cians and many ministers and many
skilled mechanics who are
reckoned
as
good as
the best in
any race. Dr.
Daniel H. Williams as a surgeon has
no superiors, also Dr. Edward Hall
has a national reputation. Lawyer
Edward Morris, S. Long Williams, Ed
ward Wright and
A. N.
Dennison
are
very able and successful lawyers. One
is assistant attorney general for the
state, one is corporation attorney for
the city of Chicago, one is city coun
sel for the municipal court. We have
two members of the Illinoisl egisla
ture and four candidates this month
for the republican nomination. A
colored regiment with all colored offi
cers, with Colonel John R. Marshall,
retired, who was the first real colonel
of our race. He was succeeded by
Colonel Dennison. With one colored
alderman in the present city council,
the first for our race in this city. With
mpre representative city positions
than ever before held by the colored
people. In fact the Chicago Daily
Tribune recently said that the Chi
cago city hall looked like an Uncle
Tom's Cabin with eighty colored po
licemen and detectives. With a $100,
000 Y. M. C. A. seven stories high,
forty-twoc hurches and missions. With
Masonic, Odd Fellows, Pythian build
ings. With dozens of drug stores and
many restaurants, groceries, dry
goods stores and confectioneries,w ith
numerous barber shops and many
other of thp diversified industries con
trolled- by our people we must say
that here lies the hope of the race,
with the thousands of beautiful homes
and flats owned, we are really optimis
tic for our future. The social side of
our visit was: On Sunday we attend
ed services at four churches and the
Good Fellowship League meeting held
by Mrs. Ida Wells Barnett and spoke
at most of these meetings. We stop
ped just across from the Y. M. C. A.,
at 3804 Wabash avenue. We met
many of our former Des Moines and
Iowa friends. Among them was Rev.
Timothy Reeves and wife, Rev. Brice
W. Taylor and wife, Kev. James P.
Higgins and wife, James R. Weeks
and wife, Mrs. Rev. Halley, formerly
of Cedar Rapids, and Mr. and Mrs.
living with him. He and his good
wife served a fine 6 o'clock dinner to
ye 'editor, his wife, children and Mrs.
Mollie Watkins and Gus Watkins. A
very enjoyable evening was spent. Mr.
and Mrs. Tillery are doing nicely.
They belong to St. Thomas Episcopal
church. This same week that we
Masons were in Chicago the people
held their annual street enr^i
proceeds of which went to the
Provi­
dent hospital. We unuerau.uu
this association cleared $1,800 on this
carnival. Dt extended from Twenty
eighth to Thirty-eight street on State
street. Indeed itwas a lively place
at night time. The Misses Virginia
Steele and Garnet Hamilton McGee
are students in the Provident hospital,
who are taking a course in nursing
and are both making a good standing,
high in their grades. Those from Iowa
at this week that we met are about
twenty-five. They areas follows. G.
M. S. Joe Brown and wife, P. G. M.
Austin A. Bland and wife, P. G. M.
John L. Thompson and wife and chil
dren, P. G. M. E. T. Banks, Gus Wat
