SHEETS' RESTAURANT
DESTROYED BY FIRE
Hix Bros. Stock Ruined. Inter
ior of Building Badly
Damaged.
Yesterday morning about 2:45
Nightwachman Seitz discovered
smoke issuing from the ventila
tor pipe in the basement of the
Lieut. Hoge to Join His Regi
ment. William Hoge, son of Col. and
Mrs. W. M. Hoge, who graduat
ed from the United States Mili
tary Academy at West Point in
June, left Wednesday to join
his regiment at Brownsville,
Texas. "Bill" has already been
promoted to First Lieutenant.
Hix building under Sheets' res. The expansion of the army un
taurant. On investigation he
saw that the whole interior of
the basement was ablaze. The
fire company was summoned im
mediately and the fight began.
The fire had evidently started in
the south end of the basement
and had gotten a good hold be
fore it was discovered. It had
worked up through the walls and
even up between the ceiling and
the roof. The water pressure
was adequate but the fire would
break out in such inaccessible
places that it took about three
hours of the hardest kind of
work to subdue it.
The damage will be consider
able. Sheets' restaurant equip
ment, together with his surplus
stock is a complete loss. Hix
Bros, stock is ruined, mostly by
water. The second floor was oc
cupied by Drs. Snyder & King
ery and Mrs. Stonestreet's dress
making parlors. The equipment
of both of these is ruined. Mrs.
Stonestreet's establishment was
filled with dresses and gowns in
the making, including several
trousseaus. .
All the parties carried, some in
surance , but probably not
enough to cover the loss.
der the bill passed during the
last session of congress created
so many vacancies that all of
the graduates of the Point in the
class of '16, received a promo
tion before serving a day in the
army. Lieut. Hoge being one of
the honor graduates had his
choice of service. He chose the
field artillery and has been as
signed to the First regiment of
field artillery now stationed at
Brownsville, Tex.

When YOU will realize aa do most citizens of this com
munitythat this is the supremely satisfying place to buy

The very beat Lumber you can get is none too good and
when it costs no more than ordinary material, why not get

ting our prices. '
