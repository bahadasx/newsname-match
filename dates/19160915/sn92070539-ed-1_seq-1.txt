Government Brings
in a Good Well
Water on New Camp Site Now
Sufficient to Supply Over 17,000
Men, Allowing! 25 Gallon! Per
Day for Each Man.
The Hulsey well drilled by the
Government on the new camp
site was tested out the first of
this week after a larger pump
and casing btd been Installed and
a much larger qinntity of water
was developed than hud been ex
pected. The capacity of the
plant first installed was only
about 50 gallons per minute. A
six inch pipe was put In and a 594
inch cylinder, which furnished
I CO gallons per minute.
Work has beon stopped on the
.Miller well located in the 2nd
Massachusetts camp until a
pumping plant is installed at the
Kngendorf well. The govern
ment did not expect to use the
Engendorf well, it being furthor
out than was intended to go with
the camp. This we!l has been
pumped for several years and
has a capacity of over 100 gallons
per minute. The Miller well will
be finished just as soon as the
driller can get back to it. The
Intentions are to drill other wells
just as soon as this one is com
pleted. Liouteuant Colonel Ru ns vorth
stated that this was the best
camp site he ever saw. The land
Is sandy and naturally drained
.md there is absolutely no danger
.if the grounds ever becoming
muddy. The tirst two wells tried
out were not very encouraging,
but the last wells developed have
proven to be far better than was
expected, and now the supply of
water is sufficient for all the
troops in the Mcinity of Columbus
with plenty to spare.
It is the general opinion among
the officers that Camp Furlong
will be the largest distributing
station on the border, and all the
preparations made so far would
indicate that a large body of
troops are expected in the near
future. The large expense that
the government is being put to
Indicates that the camp is not by
any means meant for temporary
purposes.

Home Grown Fruits
The Courier acknowledges re
ceipt of a tine lot of apples and
peaches from Mrs. W. 1. Hobbs,
grown on the Hunt place, which
Mr. and Mrs. Hobbs have rented.
The apples are well matured and
of line flavor. The peaches were
small, but sweet and of the finest
flavor. The orchard suffered
last year on account of not being
given proper attention, and
seems ulso to have affected this
year's crop. The trees are about
seven years old and have a fairly
good crop this year regardless
of the disagreeable weuther after
the bloom had come out last
spring.
Clias, Heath also has a fairly
good crop of apples. pea"s and
peaches. His fruit lias suffered
quite a lot from the birds, but
the apples and pears are tine.
His trees are also seven years
old, and have done well.

Republicans Join In Earnest
Fight To Carry Entire State

T enty Republican business and

campaign. The new workers will
be known as the advisory council.
They gathered first In Santa Fe

tinuous session from now until

The function of the new ad
visory council will be to advise
the headquarters' managers upon
campaign policy, to consult with
the candidates, to work in close
touch with the speakers' bureau
and the publicity department,

Fight at Bank Hall
The tight at the Bank Hall
Monday evening was suit! to be
the best ever pulled off in Colum
bus by those who were present.
Young Allen of Troop F of the
12th Cavalry fought Chuck Ken
ney of Troop I of the 12th
Cavalry 10 rounds, which re
suited in a draw. The men each
weighed irr lbs, und were evenly
matched. Kenney had the ad
Vantage in reach, but Allen made
up for this in self-protection.
They are both clean fighters, and
were on the job from gong to
gong. The decision was popular
with the fans, and all hope to see
another matt.h between these
two men.
The preliminary bouts were
good, and the performance was
witnessed by a full house. Young
Al)en was the promoter, and lie
expects to stage many more
fights during the winter. Allen's
nanio on the card never fails to
draw a crowd.
If it's In the Courier it's so.
Road Board Resigns
Two of the members of the
Luna County Road Board have
tendered their resignation to
Governor McDonald, uccordingto
last week's Deming Headlight.
It will be noted, however, that the
retiring members, H. H. Kelly j
und Dr. S. I). Swope, stayed on
tile job us lung as there was any
I money to spend, but when the
it.vasury was empty both men
'offered to quit. If this had taken
1 place last February doubtless it
would have met witli the same
i approval from the voters and tax
I payers of Luna County that it
1 does at present.
The Courier does not charge
any irregularities in the dis
bursement of the $25,000 wasted
this year except lack of judge
ment in spending the money in a
manner that it would be of some
benefit to the tax payers, but we
certainly would like to know
where every cent of the money
has been spent and would like to
see a financial statement.
The Courier was opposed to
the $100,000 bond issue in the
first place, and made a statement
before the date of the election
that not over fifty per cent of the
money would actually be spent
on the roads. Now we have our
doubts about fifty per cent of the
first year's appropriation being
actually spent on tho roads, and
will continue to doubt until the
finaucial statement is published.
Mr. Kelly said after the meet!
ing on Monday September 4th,
that "whatever differences had
existed before should be forgot
ten now in such an emergency
and that he would endeavor to
have something done to make
first class highway to Columbus,
and that he would invoke the
aid of Chas. Heath, and hold i
special meeting if necessary
Mr. Heath has always advocated
a good road between the two
towns, and if, witnin the last
four years, any other member of
the board would have stood by
him we would now have such
road. Mr. Kelly has known all
thu while that Mr. Heath was
ever ready to co-operate with
him if a road was really wanted,
but such co operation has never
been given.
Now, when it can be readily
seen that this road will be of
much more benefit to Deming
than Columbus, Mr. Kelly Is in
favor of drawing on next year's
appropriation to get the road so
that it cau be traveled. Deming
realizes that its chances to have
and hold a military camp depend
upon u good road from Colum
bus. Columbus wants a good
read alright, but now it matters
but little to us whether it is
finisned this year or not, though
it is a shame to let the work that
has been done be all waahed out
and wasted.
The roadwork In this county
should be kept moving forward.
There is only one man on the
board, the funds are exhausted.
Let Deming get busy and have
two good men men who will do
something appointed on the
board. Let the new board ap
point a competent man to over
see the work a man who will
devote his time and attention to
the work and the rest of the
bond money can bo of some value
to the people.
There aro plenty of men l;i
Deming who would give this
proper attention. II. G. Bush
and Fred Sherman could not be
beaten for the jobs. Iet us have
a good road, It will benefit us all.

Columbus Ice Plant
Is Now Running
It Is Now No Longer Necessary for
the People of Columbus and the
Army to Depend Entirely on El
Paso Ice.
The Columbus Ice and Cold
Storage Company have their
plant completed, and are supply
Ing local demand for the frozen
stuff. The machinery was put
into operation Sunday morning,
and lias not been shut down
since. It takes some time to
get everything in perfect run
ning order, and to get tho plant
cooled down sufficiently to freeze,
but Thursday the people were
being supplied with home-manu
factured ice.
The ice plant is located in the
Rice addition, a short distance
from the depot. A good build
ing lias been erected at an ex
pense of several thousand dol
lars in addition to the cost of
machinery. The plant is mod
em in every respect and conve
niently arranged. Storage rooms
have been provided, and can be
taken advantage of by anyone
having perishable goods at a
moderate rate.
A. Frederickson, proprietor of
the Columbus Ice and Cold Stor
age Compauy has averoged pay
ing $40 tier day for freight alone
during the summer. The people
in El Paso who manufactured
the ice also came in for a neat
sum. Now this money will bo
spent at home. No doubt the
investment will be a paying one
for Mr Frederickson, and the
money he has been sending
away from home will in a large
measure be spent for wages for
his employees.
The plant is not a large one.
and during the summer months
will not supply all the local de
mand for ice. It is a ten-ton
plant, which can easily be added
to, and if at a later date the firm
decides that a larger plant is
needed it will be installed.
Columbus lias always had to
depend on oilier towns for ice,
ice cream und soft drinks until
recently. We now have two ice
cream factories, two bottling
works and the ice factory. Re
member that when you buy the
products for these factories you
are patronizing home industry
and boosting Columbus AlwayR
insist upon home-made goods
when possible, and watch Col u in
bus grow into a thriving and
prosperous city.
