Former North Dakota Sena
tor for President

H. C. Hansbrough. prominent North
Dakotan, who served eighteen years

democratic national campaign com
mittee that he intended to support
President Wilson for re-election and
take an active part in the campaign.
"One of the reasons why I cannot
vote for Mr. Hughes," he is quoted as
saying, "is because I cannot consci
entiously take orders from Theodore
Roosevelt and George W. Perkins. I
know them of old. I heard the Grand
Forks address of Mr. Hughes and
noted the fact that his tour of the
Northwest was stimulated by the ac
tive presence of the President of the
Oreat Northern Railway. I am for
Wilson because I believe in the prin
ciples of Abraham Lincoln rather
than a man who represents the spe
cial interests and privileged classes as
distinguished from the true democ
racy of the country."

Paris. Sept. 15.—The French gov

at Stockholm to join with the other

takes issue with the position of
1 Swerten in
distinguishing between
submarines for war and those for
commerce, which the French govern
ment affirms has an effect contrary to
neutrality since naval forces would
hestitate to attack a German Bub
marine in Swedish waters under the
pretext that it might be a commercial
submarine, whereas, there would be
no similar hestitation ln dealing with
an Entente submarine, because none
is a commercial submarine. The
note deals with a number of naviga

"The attitude adopted by the
Swedish government is at variance ln
obvious respects with the attitude
which is compatible with the duties
of a loyal and impartial, neutral."
