MAINE GOBS REPUBLICAN.
The state of Maine has always occu
pied a rather unique place in presiden
tial elections, in that it holds its election
lor state officers in September. This
early expression of political sentiment is
always watched with great interest by
politicans as it presages to some extent
the results of the November electisns.
"As goes Maine so goes the Union" has
passed into a proverb.
Four years ago the Republican party
split in Maine as it did in other states,
which gave the Democratic minority the
control of the state officers, one senator
and one congressman.
The returns now indicate that the Re
publicans have won out by a substantial
majority all along the lines.
f.*$The election was won on national is
sues. Both parties had a large number
of prominent speakers campaigning
there, great meetings were held, and
even the old-fashioned torch light pro
cessions were revived, and they have
certainly had a "hot time in the old
state" during the last two months.
The political question was what would
the former Progressives do? Would
they "come back" or would they drift to
the Democratic party?
There were reasons for these questions.
To a considerable extent the old lines
between the parties were broken. The
European war, the Mexican fracas, the
questions of "preparedness" and the
treatment of these issues by the Presi
dent and a Democratic Congress and
perhaps the threatened railroad strike,
were all matters on which for the tirst
time a large body of voters have express
ed their opinions.
The election returns from Maine look
like the probable election of Hughes in
November.
THE PROGRESS OF THE WAR.
There has nothing occured of special
significance on the European battlefields
this week. As usual, lighting has been
going on at different points, with vary
ing successes and conflicting reports.
On the whole the progress is in favor of
the allies and show that they are still
squeezing along all lines.
Indications are that we may expect
some heavy fighting in the future. In
the Soinme region both French and
English report advances for short dis
tances but along considerable fronts.
They now claim to be in complete posses
aion of the German second defence lines
but what is really a greater gain is that
they have compelled the Germans to
bring up large bodies of troops from
other points to defend the Strom me
position and thus weakening other
points where they are needed. By this
Stromme drive they claim to have re
leived tbe German pressure on Verdun.
There are now so many different
"fronts" circling about Germany and
Austria that it takes studious study of
maps to keep up on tbe geography of
the war. Besides this the long foreign
names puzzle the reader. This is es
pecially true in the Balkans where there
are at the present about four different
"fronts." S'inin of the best critics of
the war tbi nk that Austria will be the
final battle ground tbe Russians ad
vancing from the north and east, the
Roumanians from Transylvania and
across the Danube and the Salonika
army from the southeast. Austria and
Serbia started the war and it is quite
possible that it may end there. Few
critics think that either of the opposing
forces along the French boundaty will
be able to make a decisive stroke, but it
will be the business of the entente
armies to keep the Teutons in front of
them while the Russians and otber east
ern allies make decision on the eastern
lines. It seems to be a general opinion
that the war will last another year. It
will be another wonder of this wonder
ful war if the contending nations can
hold out that long.

Yours Truly,
WM. W. FELSON.
The above figures, as stated were giv
en us in reply to our personal request to
tbe county auditor. The items even in
a very general way are of interest to
every taxpayer, and are also well worth
analysis.
Our attention was called to this mat
ter by some statements published in a
state paper over the signature of Fred
Packard, who is one of the state tax
commission. Figures and discussion of
them by Mr. Packard are of intern!
from the fact that be occupies bis -pro*
sent position and should be an expert in
matters of taxation.
Bnt for some reason Mr. Packard
manipulates bis statistics apparently,
with political prejudices, instead of fair
discussion wbieh everyone would wel
come.
"Figures will not lie" is an old proverb
but there are more lies told with help of
the ten numerical digits than with any
other machinery in the world. A skill
ful performer can play any tune lie:
chooses on these ten keys.
Just now, we would call attention to
Mr. Packard's broad statement that tbe
"per capita" taxation in this stale is
925. The figures given by tbe county
auditor for this county are a little less
but would go to prove the statement, as
when made of the whole state.
If there is anything more deceiving
than the digits themselves it is that
man ''PerCapita." He is a liar and
base deceiver from his very conception.
Looking at the. first table above we
find that while Mr. Capita pays a pretty
heavy tax yet on the other hand be has
aright to do so because he is a very'
heavy property holder. The table shows
that in this county of Pembina that
each person, each man, each woman,
each child owns 9554.80 worth of person
al property and real estate. But as all
property is supposed to be assessed at
one fourth actual value, we arrive at
the rather astonishing conclusion that
each person, without distinction of sex
or size, owns in actual value 92,218 00 of
property, or each family of five together
are the comfortable possessors of 911,090
of real and personal property.
And really if it is true that Mr. Per
Capita pays 925 taxes on over 92,000
worth of property that is not a very high
rate of taxation.
Let us try this "per capita" business
in another form. Taking the above
tables we find that according to the vote
that Joliette township has about three
hundred and eighty-five inhabitants. It
is evident that a considerable number of
these such as renters and laborers are
not the owners of or have a contingent
interest in real estate. Suppose for this
and convenience we drop off say ninety
seven. Then we again arrive at tbe re
markabre result that each of the remain'
ing "per capita" own a quarter section
of land, because there are approximately
288 quarter sections in that double town
ship,and that each family of live operates
a farm of five quarter sections.
Those are the kind of results that we
find when we take the digits and play
tbe tune called "Per Capita." Every
taxpayer knows that these are false
notes. Like the man who saw the hip
popotamus for the first time, we say
"There ain't no such animal."
What is wrong about these "per capi
ta" figures? Mostly because per capita
is average but not ordinary. What the
ordinary citizen pays as taxes and what
the amount would be if he paid the
"average" are not the same thing by
any means.
To get at what the ordinary taxpayer
pays we must eliminate two classes, first
those who pay little or nothing, and sec
ond those who pay on large accumula
lions of property of an exceptional nat
ure. It is absurd to try to average the
taxes of two men one of whom just pays
poll tax of a dollar and the other pays
perhaps a total tax of 9500. That the
"average" tax paid by these two men is
9250.50 cents is simply an absurdity and
devoid of sense.
But Mr, Packard after getting such
conclusion goes into a long series of
calculations as to how many weeks it
takes tbe laboring man or clerk to pay
his taxes of as ahead of a family of 9125,
"There aint no such animal" Mr. Pack
ard.
We have not the time or space to go
much farther into the above tables.
The figures speak for themselves. One
item is remarkable, and we think will be
news to many readers. The fast that
railroads and telephones, pay on an as
sessed valuation exceeding the total of
all personal property. The railroads
alone pay as much taxes as is paid on
all the personal property in tbe county
aud approximate the same proportion in
the whole state. Even Mr. Packard
thinks they are paying their share. But
it is also evident that when we are figur
ing with Mr. Per Capita we have aright
to first take out the railway taxes, Mr.
Per Capita is not a railroad man.
Neither is he a banker or storekeeper.
The real question is what does the ordi
nary farmer, the laborer, the clerk, the
professional man, in otber words what
do the middle class people pay?
There are some other taxation ques
tions that come before us in this connec
tion which we may discuss another
week. But we ask the reader to look
these figures over ctrrefully and keep
them in mind. It is to your interest.
"Death and taxes" are the two certain
ties of life.
PEMBINA, PEMBINA COUNTY, NORTajDAKOTA, FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 15th, 1916.
I
JUNE PRIMARIES AND
AUGUST PLATFORMS.
Sunday's Grand Forks Herald points
out another absurdity apparent in the
North Dakota primary laws. The pri
mary occurs in June and the candidates
are selected at that time, but the party
platform is not made until August when
the committee meets. Meantime the
selected candidates are supposed to be
without a definite party policy
Afeain, at tbe late meeting of the Re
publican committee tbe opposing fac
tions were only one or two votes apart,
There is no doubt as to what most of
the candidates as selected stood for, but
if it had happened as it easily might,
that the conservative faotion had bad a
couple more votes, then the party plat
form would have been radically different
and the candidates thus bound to sup
port principles which they do not be
lieve and to oppose principles on which
they were nominated and to which they
have already declared their adherence.
The primary law assumes that each
voter shall make a personal selection of
candidates for his party. That is good
as for as it goes. The present result
proves that he should logically, go still
farther and at the same time write upon
his ballot his special party principles
and not leave it to a committee that
might start his candidate in the race—
running backwards.
