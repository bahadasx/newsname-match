;,'■' Nominations for
Representative
Complete ' returns from all but
(even of the 79 precincts in Whit
man county show that R. L. McCros
ley has been elected superior judge
m Thomas Neill by a majority of
' approximately 1200. On the other
offices only six precincts are missing
md in all of them a light vote was
cut, so that it will be impossible to
change the results except possibly on
democratic candidate for commis
sioner in this district, for which M.
D, Henry has a lead of only six votes
•over J. D. Carson. Clinton and Bald
Butte are the only two precincts
sluing which are included in this
commissioner district, and it is ex
pected that Henry will maintain his
lead or possibly increase it.
Both Pullman men are eliminated
(rom the race for the republican
nominations for state representative
from the Seventh district, Hoover
and Jones leading Campbell and
Watt by substantial margins. Good
year and Miller are the democratic
nominees for the same office.
The county gave Bryan a big vote
lor United States senator, th^7 3 pre
cincts returning him 1807 first
choice and 641 second choice votes
to 153 and 874 for Poindexter ana
ISO and 829 for Humphrey.
LaFollette, for congress, polled
2432 first choice and 344 second
choice votes to 315 and 836 for Har
- risen, 249 and 842 for Hale and 184
and 423 for Fouts. Sutton and Mc-
Bride ran a close race in the county
for the republican \ nomination for
governor, Sutton polling 1199 firsts
and 592 seconds to 947 and 890 for
Mcßride. Hartley was third with
'408 and 524. On the democratic
ticket Lister led Cass, 1285 to 182.
Mrs. Preston led in this county
'lor state school superintendent, get
ling 1688 and 467 to 749 and 885

SATURDAY'S PRICES

Yesterday
Yesterday's Quotations
Red Russian wheat $1.10
Club wheat $I.IH
Forty-old wheat ........ .$1.20
Oats, per cwt $1.32
Harley, per cwt $1.0."
The highest price paid for red
r wheat in Pullman this season and
with a single exception the highest
i price ever paid here was received last
Saturday by Arthur Busby of near
Chambers, when he sold 1800 sacks
jof No. 1 red wheat to the Houser
! agency at $1.22 the bushel. In
! February of last year, after practic
ally the entire crop of the year be
i fore bad been sold, quotations at
| least 10 cents higher than Satur
day's figures were made, but the
I farmers were in no position to profit
1 through the advances. This year,
' with half the wheat already sold at
a figure close to tbe dollar mark,
I and the balance due to go at a price
i well above that mark, the farmers
I will profit hugely through the high
markets, and a period of prosperity
unprecedented in the annals of Whit
! man county should result
The highest price paid this year
i for barley was $1.72 the hundred
weight, received by W. H. Brabyn
for approximately 500 sacks sold to
William Chambers last Thursday,
while several lots of oats brought
the high market price of $1.40.
! Grain men estimate that 50 per cent
of the wheat crop, 90 per cent of the
barley crop and 30 per cent of the
oat crop has already been sold, the
contract and actual prices on the
wheat already sold averaging above
the dollar mark.
MOTHERS* MEETING

NUMBER 48
WEST SIDE VOTE
DEFEATS BRYAN
Poindexter Nondnatpd for Senator,
McßriAi for Governor, and La
Follette for Congressman
While the returns of tho vote cast
in the state at the primary election
Tuesday are far from complete, they
are sufficient to show who have won
the nominations for all the more Im
portant offices. Interest in Pullman
centered in the candidacy of Dr. E.
A. Bryan for the republican nomina
tion for United States senator. In
the east side counties, where he la
best known be ran a close race with
Poindexter and led Humphrey by a
substantial margin, but on the west
side he was unable to develop suf
ficient strength to win. On the re
turns to date Poindexter has approxi
mately 87,000 first and second choice
votes to 80,000 for Humphrey aud
65,000 for Bryan.
On the returns so far received
! from 35 counties, Henry Mcßride
j has a safe lead for the republican
I nomination for governor, the figuten
standing: Mcßrlde, 57,720 first and
second choice votes combined; Hart
ley. 50,781; Sutton, 39,228; Lee,
37,174.
A feature of the primary election
was the big vote polled by W. L. La
Follette for congressman from the
Fourth congressional district. The
combined first and second choice
votes shown by the returns from all
the counties in the district, except
Grant, are as, follows;'
LaFollette 12,203
Hale 6,894
Harrison 6,881
Fouts 5,177
Parker 4,455
Comparatively meager western
Washington returns indicate the re
nomination of Lieutenant Governor
Louis P. Hart! although Arthur W.
Davis of Spokane is maintaining a
good lead in eastern Washington. W.
W. Sherman of Olympia apparently
has defeated Calvin J. Can- of Ta
coma by a good plurality for the
nomination for state treasurer, and
the renomination of Mrs. Josephine
Preston, as state superintendent of
instruction, now is generally con
ceded.
Three supreme court judges, Em
met N. Parker, Mark A. Fullerton
1 and George E. Morris, lead the Judi
! cial ticket by a considerable margin,
'and It is probable that each has se
cured a majority of all votes cast.
'Judge J. Stanley Webster also has
j received a clear majority of all votes
I cast for the short term, and the
; names of these judges will go on the
November ballot unopposed.
Democratic Contests
In every part of the state Governor
, Ernest Lister and George Turner re
! reived heavy majorities over oppo3
--1 ing candidates for the democratic
gubernatorial and senatorial nonii
' nations, respectively.
