COUNTY FAIR NOW GOING ON
ATTENDANCE YESTERDAY WAS
GOOD—ABOUT AS MANY EN
TRIES AS LAST YEAR
The county fair of the Morrison
County Co-operative Agricultural so
ciety opened here Wednesday and is
now in full swing. On Wednesday the
"weather was favorable except in the
evening and yesterday it was fair al
though the temperature was rather
low. At p. in. yesterday the total
number of paid admissions were 1,000
and the management expressed the be
lief that last year's record for the
first day would be broken as a large
crowd was expected to attend last
night. The total attendance on Thurs
day last year was 1,662.
Exhibits in the livestock, agricul
tural and fruit departments are more
numerous this year than last but there
are 500 less in'the scnool and women's
department. The exact entry figures
are as follows: Agriculture 500, live
stock 106, poultry 44, fruits and mis
cellaneous, butter, cheese and honey,
201, women's 'department, 428, school
department 902, Farmers' clubs, 5.
The receipts for entries this year were
less than last ye r, being $130.50 as
c-ompared with $17:!.50 for 1915.
All the numbers on the program of
entertainment are said to be very
good and the trap shooting of J. H.
Stair and Dave Flannigan, which takes
place at 1:00 p. in. each day, is fine.
]For the kiddies there is a merry-go
round.
Tomorrow afternoon, in addition to
"the regular program of entertainment
and a tug-of-war between Farmers'
clubs, the fair visitors will be given
the opportunity of hearing Daniel W.
Lawler, democratic candidate for the
C. S. senate from this state, speak.
IMr. Lawler is an able speaker and his
talk promises, to be interesting.
The exhibits at the fair this year
are, on the whole, very good, in spite
of the unfavorable growing season,
•tvhieh, of course, was general through
out the country. It is clearly evident
that the farmers in this vicinity are
each year giving their crops better at
tention with a view to getting their
products more uniform in size and of
a better quality, rather than to see
how large products they can grow, re
gardless of the quality.
First as one enters the fair grounds
one's eyes meets that most delectable
display of fruits, which indeed is
splendid and would be a credit to any
county. True there are as yet no per
sons who are growing fruit on a large
scale in this county, but nevertheless
tlie fact that Morrison county is adapt
ed to the raising of fruits cannot be
disputed. The apple exhibits constitute
ftlie greater part of the display and in-
eludes the various kinds of eating ap
pies, as •well as crab apples of the first
class. Then there are plums, several
different kinds of grapes, strawber
ries. raspberries^, cherries, and even
cranberries.
The agricultural building, next in
line, is well filled with exhibits of farm
produce. The corn exhibit is probably
the best of all and a large number of
•entrie-s have been made in this. Grains,
•while not as good as usual, owing to
the fact that the unusually hot weath
"1 caused them to mature too soon, are
well represented in their section, as
are beans, peas, clover and timothy
seed, etc. Grasses are fine and there
are a number of good exhibits of al
falfa. The potato exhibit is a fine
one.
Garden vegetables, such as cucum
bers. radishes, beets, turnips, cabbage,
tomatoes, carrots, celery, etc., are all
very good. And talk about water
melons, musk melons, canteloupes, etc!
There are an usually large number of
entries, and there's no use talking—
the kiln! we grow in Morrison county
sire equal to any, barring none.
A feature of the agricultural build
ing is the farmers' club exhibit. There
are several entries and all promise to
"be in close competition for high hon
ors. Their exhibits include every
thing grown on the farm, as well as
canned fruits, preserves, flowers, etc.
Don't miss seeing these, if you have
not already seen them, as they are sim
ply great.
The number of exhibits of stock is
some larger than last year. Blooded
and pure bred stock is tery much in
evidence, showing that the farmers in
'this vicinity are getting away from
the scrub stock. The first line of stalls
contain horses and' colts, then come
the cattle, poultry, hogs and sheep.
In the women's building the first
thing that greets your eye as you enter
from the south entrance is a child wel
fare exhibit, which was loaned to the
Civic leegue by the Minnesota Public
Health r-nsociation. This exhibit con
sists' ly of large placards with pic
tures and reading matter, explaining
how to take care of baby and what is
good and what is bad ^or the little
one. The ladies are also distributing
literature along this line which is sup
plied by the association. Make it a
point to see this exnibit.
The display oi fancy work and sew
ing of all kinds in this building is
-wonderful. There is among the ex
hibits an entry which consists of a
table set which the party making the
"\ntry insists, was made entirely by a
man. The display of baking is a most
inviting one The exhibits in this de
partment are shown in a glass floor
Although the last to be mentioned,
the school exhibit in the school build
ing, is by no means the least, but
rather one of the most important and
interesting on the entire grounds. Here
one can find almost anything one can
think of, even to an almost perfect
„yTodel of an automobile and a silo,
^vliich. are entered in the rural school
exhibit. Farm produce raised by the
school boys and girls forms a promi
nent part of the exhibits in this build
ing, and includes nearly everything
that is grown on the farm. Then there
are exhibits of cooking, sewing, draw
ing, manual training, etc. The rural
school exhibit is very -large and tne
EIGHT IN AUTO ..
JOHN ZILKE AND FAMILY
THIS CITY AND GUESTS
HAVE TURN OVER
As the result of a tire coming off
from one of the -wheels on the car in
which they were riding, John Zilke
and family of this city and Frank
Wagner of International Falls, who
was visiting with Zilke, and another
man, eight persons in all, met with an
accident on the road between Royalton
and this city, about a mile and a half
from the former place Wednesday af
ternoon. Only two of the eight per
sons escaped injury but none of the
occupants of the car were seriously
hurt.
The party had been at Royalton for
a visit and wrere returning home, at
about 4:30 in the afternoon. In some
manner the tire on one of the wheels
of the car came off and the car was
thrown to the side. A team was com
ing from the opposite direction and
Mr. Zilke, who was driving the car,
tried to get back in the road, with the
result that the car tipped over. One
of the occupants of the front seat wis
thrown through the glass windshield.
People who Happened by just after
the accident occurred' took the people
to Royalton, where their wounds were
dressed and they were then brought to
Little Falls and their injuries attend
ed to.
Mr. Zilke had a deep cut on the
wrist and otner smaller cuts and
bruises. Wagner had a cut between
four or five inches long on his head
and one just above the left eve. Both
cuts were deep, clear to the bone. His
chest was also injured but there was
no serious fracture of his ribs. Both
women had their left wrists hurt and
one of the children, aged two years,
had its left arm hurt.

HIGH SCHOOL BOYS WARMING UP
—MANY OUD PLAYERS
LOST
Although school has been in session
but two weeks the boys have already
turned their attention toward foot
ball and they are out practicing every
evening when the weather is favora
ble. Coach Liljedahl says he has a
likely bunch of candidates for the team
and he hopes to develop a winning
squad.
Mr. Zipoy who is arranging the
schedule, has communicated with the
high schools at Btainerd, Aitkin, St.
Cloud', Alexandria and Anoka for
games. St. Cloud has already been
scheduled for October 21. The first
game of the season will probably be
on September 30 or October 7. Only
about six games will be scheduled.
The team will be composed almost
entirely of new players, as the best
boys on last year's team have been
lost. Graham, Belanger, Sutliff, Bran
nen and Longley graduated and Felix
is with the National Guard at the bor
der. Two of the old players, Levin
and Sims, will be back on the team
this year and the subs will also try for
positions.
The basketball season will probably
open in the latter part of November
but no games with outside teams will
be scheduled to be played until after
Christmas. About a 12-game schedule
will be arranged. Last year the team
played 18 games but this is considered
too much as during the basketball
season all other activities at the
school are suspended.
DIED
Mrs. Mary .J. Tanner, a pioneer resi
dent of Little Falls and well' known
here, passed away at her home at 212
Third street southeast, yesterday
morning at 3:30 from acute stomach
trouble, after an illness of but two
days' duration. The news of her
death comes as a distinct shock, as,
while she was quite advanced in age,
her health had previously been good.
She was 68 years of "age.
Mrs. Tanner, whose maiden name
was Mary J. Simmons, was the daugh
ter of Dr. J. O. Simmons, who prac
ticed his profession here in the early
days. She was born in Medina coun
ty, Ohio, on February 3, 1848. In 1856
she came to Little Falls with her par
ents and: ever since that time she ha3
resided here. In 1868 she was mar
ried to Alfred Tanner, who was the
first owner of the Little Falls Milling
company, now operated by his son, L.
V.* Tanner. Mrs. Tanner was a wom
an of sterling qualities and had a wide
host of friends who will mourn her de
^sft^ure. She -was- one of itihe -oldest
members of the Chureh of Our Saviour
of this city.
Eight grown children, four sons and
four daughters, survive the deceased.
The sons are H. H. Tanner of Minne
apolis, L. V. Tanner of this city, C. L.
Tanner of Saskatoon, Canada and
Louis R. Tanner of Detroit, Mich. The
daughter are Mrs. A. R. Davidson of
Winnipeg, Canada, Mrs. J. K. Martin
and Mrs. W. H. K. Mover of this city
and Mrs. W. W. Hunter of Coleraine.
She also leaves three brothers, W. L.
Simmons of Danvenport, la., F. B. Sim
mons and Chas. G. Simmons of Port
land, Ore, all formerly of this city.
There are also fourteen grandchildren.
All the children except C. L. Tanner
and L. R. Tanner are here.
The funeral will be held tomorrow
afternoon at 2:30, but it has not yet
been decided whether it will be from
the home or from the church. Rev.
George Archbold Ray will officiate. In
terment will be in Oakland cemetery.
James A. Brown, who was a resident
of Little Falls for about forty years,
passed away at a hospital at Rochester
Sunday evening. He had been at the
hospital for about two weeks for treat
ment -for an illness from which he had
suffered for nearly a year. A nervous
breakdown, followed by temporary in
sanity, caused him to bring about his
own demise. He was 53 years of age.
Deceased was born in Ohio March
11, 1863. He came to this city with
his parents when but three years of
age and grew to manhood here. He
spent several years in the west, return
ing from there in 1892. He also lived
at Brainerd for one year. For a num
ber of years he was bus driver for the
Buckman hotel of this city, serving in
that capacity until about two years
ago, when he went to St. Paul to live.
Mr. Brown was well known in Little
Falls and he also had a wide acquaint
ance among the traveling men of this
state, gained while bus driver.
Surviving the deceased are five
brothers and four sisters. The broth
ers are William Brown, Seattle, Wash.
John Brown, White Bear, Dana, Ethan
S. and Elias F. Brown of this city.
The sisters are Mrs. Sadie Philips of
Bremerton, Wash. Mrs. Martha Van
Camp, Minneapolis, Mrs. A. McDon
ald, St. Paul and Miss Jennie Brown,
Minneapolis.
The remains were brought to this
city Tuesday and the funeral was held
from the home of a brother, Elias F.
Brown, at 2:30 Tuesday afternoon,
Rev. Philip E. Gregory of the Congre
gational church officiating. Interment
was at Oakland cemetery.
Those from outside of town here for
the funeral were Mr. and Mrs. John
Brown of White Bear, Mr. and Mrs.
A. McDonald of St. Paul, Mrs. Martha
VanCamp and Miss Jennie Brown of
Minneapolis.
Felix Plettl, who has been a resi
dent of Little Falls for the past twen
ty-three years, passed away Sunday
at 9:15 p. m. at his home over the Milo
theatre nere, after about two months'
illness from tuberculosis of the throat
and lungs. He was 60 years of age.
Deceased was born in Germany Jan
uary 11, 1856. He was raised and ed
ucated there and was also married
there He came to this country with
his family in 1892, locating at Lewis
ton, Mont. From there they came to
NEARLY $200,000 UNUSED FUNDS
RESTORED TO STATE TREAS
URY IN PAST 2 YEARS
St. Paul Letter of County Chairman:
jManv boards and commissions go to
make up Minnesota's state govern
ment, but none of them approach in
importance that of the state board of
control, the duties of which are the
management and financial control of
some^ sixteen state institutions. Though
provided with a line of activity in
volving the welfare of many thou
sands of dependents and the expendit
ure of millions of dollars, few state
departments have less of the spotlight,
land this fact explains the total ab
sence of publicity when the board the
other day did the almost unheard of
thing of turning back into the state
treasury unused balances totaling over
$100,000. The year before this same
'board turned back similar balances
amounting to over $90,000 and there
was a like absence of the spotlight.
Had any other department performed
the same miracle it would have been
heralded all over the state. Annually
the various state departments are
called upon to turn in to the state au
ditor a list of unexpended moneys, but
as a rule the amounts found are woe
fully small, and when a department
like the board of control in two years
finds nearly $200,000 it can return to
the state treasury the saving to the
taxpayers of the state represents some
thing that calls for more than ordi
nary mention. Had the board so de
sired it could have spent ev» ry cent
of the amount turned in and' there
wrould have been no comeback. The
board, however, preferred to play
square with those who pay the bills
and the $200,000 now reposing in the
state treasury is the answer.
Listed in the balances turned back
into the state treasury by the board
is one of nearly $30,000 saved from
the amount appropriated by the legis
lature for the support of the Anoka
asylum for the insane. Another in
volves over $30,000 saved in the man
agement of the St. Peter hospital for
the insane, and still another, an item
of $12,000, saved from the amount ap
propriated for the support of the state
school for the feeble minded, at Fari
bault. Altogether there are ten items
of similar savings for the year 1916,
while those for 1915 amount to a score
or more ranging in amounts from $100
to $25,000. The latter amount repre
sents unused moneys to the credit of
the state institutions' contingent fund.
This year over $166,000 was turned in
from the same source. Considering the
marked advance in the cost of living
and the high prices asked for every
thing the saving made by the board
in tne management of the various
state institutions is remarkable and
calls for the highest praise. The
(board was created in 1900 and it is a
safe bet that in the sixteen years of
its existence it has saved the taxpay
ers millions of dollars. The pity is
that other institutions of the state
originally under its control were ever
taken away from the board the state
university, for instance.
The members of the board are C. -T.
Swendsen, St. James, Ralph W. Wheel
ock, Minneapolis and Chas. E. Vasaly
of Little Falls.
BOY HUNTER BADLY HURT WHEN
SHOTGUN BURSTS
Arthur Simmons, youngest son of
Mr. and Mrs. Ed. Simmons of the West
side, met with a very painful accident
yesterday while out hunting when
his shotgun burst into pieces upon be
ing discharged.
He sustained a bad1 cut over one
eye, just over the eyelid., and his face
was badly burned. His left had was
also hurt but as yet the exact extent
of the injury to the hand has not been
determined.
This is the first accident! here since
hunting season opened.
Congressman Chas. A. Lindbergh
has returned from Washington, D. C.,
and he will not return to Washington
again until in December, congress
having adjourned until that time.
The baseball game between the Elks
and the All Stars, which was to have
been played at the fair grounds last
Sunday, was postponed on account of
rain. The two teams may decide to
clash next Sunday, although they have
not as yet deeided.
Efforts to get a bull moose for the
Pine Grove park seem to be in vain,
every place where on© might be secur
ed having been tried, without success.
There are some moose at Yellowstone
park but the government will not dis
pose of any of them owing to the fact
that there are but very few in the
park and it is very hard to capture
them.
Little Falls in 1894 and they have liv
