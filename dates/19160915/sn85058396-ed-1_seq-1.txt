UNUSUAL TRIBUTE
TO-NJEVILLE
French General, Who Defend
ed Verdun, Decorated With
High Insignia.
Paris, Sopt. 15, 10:10 a. m. A trlb
ute unusual foj an official French com
munication, is paid to General Nle
ville, the defender of Verdun, in the
Journal Officlel today. Announce
ment was made on Wednesday that
General Nievlllo had been decorated
with insignia of grand officer of the
Legion of Honor, and in this connec
tion the following citation is pub
lished: -
"Robert George Nievllle, general of
division commanding an army, has for
four months commanded the army
that resisted victoriously the attacks
of tho enemy, renewed without cessa-
tlon and has supported heroically the
hardest trials. He has shown in this
command with the most brilliant qual
ities of leadership an energy and
force of character which have power
fully Influenced the operations in
progress over the entire front
"After having checked the advance
of the enemy toward his objective
which had become a moral stake of
e the war, General Nieville resumed tho
offensive, foot by foot, and by his at
tacks succeeded in dominating the ad
versary on the very ground chosen by
the latter for a decisive effort"
TO REFUSE U. S.
CONSIGNMENTS
i American Shipments for Hol-
land Will Be Stopped Brit-
ish Take Action.
I London, Thursday, Sept. 14, C p. m.
(Delayed) The plan of rationing
the neutral countries of Norway, Swe
den, Denmark and Holland under
which no further licenses will be
granted for the present to British ex
porters, has been extended to apply
to the United States by the expedients
of refusing to allow The Netherlands
Overseas Trust to accept further
American 'consignments, and by de
clining to grant letters of assurance
for American shipments destined for
theso countries.
In consequence American shipments
for Holland will be stopped absolute
ly while the regular transportation
companies trading between the Unit
ed States and Scandinavia will not
take cargoes without assurances of
their innocent destination by the Brit
ish authorities. Furthermore, tramp
steamers are hardly likely to risk the
inevitable landing in the prize court
of any cargo they might accept.
Neutral diplomats here believed two
reasons induced the British govern
ment to take this action. The first
is the simplicity of the plan, which
I enables the government to control
supplies at the source. The second
Is the gro ing bill with which Great
Britain is being pressed by neutral
governments for demurrage and other
expenses incurred by taking suspect
ed ships into Kirkwall and other ports
for examination.
Another blockade measure is the
recent arrangement under which bu
reaus were set up in England and
France for granting licenses for ex
change of goods which figure on the
Mist of prohibited Imports. The Amer
, ican authorities contend that under
I Great Britain-American commercial
treaty of 1S15 such prohibitions must
I he enforced equally against all coun
j tries. Consequently any privileges
i granted to Franco and not extended
to the United States are held to be
in violations of that treaty.

PRESIDENT IS TO
MAKE STATEMENT
Challenging Hughes' Remarks
Will Be One of Principal
Points of Wilson's Talk.
Long Branch, N. J., Sept 15 Pres
ident Wilson decided today to take
advantage of the earliest possible op
portunity to challenge the statement
made by Charles E. Hughes In recent
speeches that the basis on which the
recently threatened railway strike
was averted was merely an increase
of wages for the employes.
The president, his political advis
ers said today, considers the princi
ple of the eight-hour day vitally af
fected by the strike settlement, and
will seek to show that while the rail
road legislation passed by congress to
meet the situation, will give the em
ployes at least a temporary Increase
In pay, the more Important Is that It
established the eight-hour day as the
basis of work for railroad workmen.
Tho president will make known his
views either in a speech at Shadow
Lawn, or in a letter.
Mr. Wilson expects to make clear
that he will not be satisfied until con
gress enacts into tho law the rest of
the railroad legislation he recom
mended when the strike was threat
ened, Including an increase in the in
terstate commerce commission and a
measure for Investigation of contro
versies between railways and their
employes before strikes or lockouts
aro called.
ALLIES TO SEND
NOTETOSWEDEN
Claim Country Is Acting Con
trary to Neutrality in Regard
to Submarines.
Paris, Sept. 15, 11:45 a. m. Tho
French government has instructed the
minister at Stockholm to join with the
other entente ministers in presenting
a friendly but firm note to Sweden in
regard to its policy of neutrality. The
note takes Isbuo with the position of
Sweden in distinguishing between sub
marines for war and those for com
merce, which the French government
affirms has an effect contrary to
neutrality since the Swedish naval
forceB would hesitate to attack a Ger
man submarine in Swedish waters un

mercial submarine, whereas there
would be no similar hesitation in deal
ing with a submarine of the allies be
cause they have no commercial sub
marines. Great Britain and Sweden have been
at odds since the early period of the
war and Sweden's unyielding attitude
evidently has resulted in a decision to
exert the combined pressure of all the
entente allies on her. Difficulties
arose from the allied blockade of Ger
many, resulting in the holding up of
goods enroute to Sweden which were
suspected to be destined for Ger
many. Sweden retaliated by holding
up large parcels post matter in tran
sit between England and Russia,
This led to an exchange of notes
which accomplished nothing arid early
this month a deadlock was reached.
Great Britain insisted as a condition
to submitting the dispute to arbitra
tion that Sweden must promise not to
interfere again with English mail mat
ter. Sweden declined and the Swedish
minister at London went to the conti
nent to be gone for sever.il weeks.
Negotiations were transferred to
Stockholm, but the latest advices from
London were that no solution of the
problem was in sight
Berlin, September 15. By wireless
to Sayville, A Stockholm dispatch to
tho Overseas News Agency says that
Sweden has held up 10,000 tons of
coffee destined for Finland, presum
ably on account of the fact that Great
Britain has detained shipments of cof
fee for Sweden. As a result there is a
great scarcity of coffee in Finland.

MEXICAN AFFAIRS
HARDJO SOLVE
Numerous Suggestions of
Joint Commission Fail
Border Policing Ob
jected To.
New London, Conn., Sept. 15.
Practical obstacles have arisen in tho
consideration by the American-Mexican
joint commission here of numer
ous suggestions for the protection of
the border which make it seem Im
probable at this time that any agree
ment can be formulated without pro
longed discussion.
Major-General Tasker H. Bliss, as
sistant chief of staff of the army, waB
before the commission today to point
out objections that can be raised to
many of tho proposals Including those
of an international constabulary to re
lievo the military forces of both coun
tries of the border patrol work they '
are now doing.
The commission held only a brief i
session, the Mexican party planning
to leave for New York today to at-
tend the celebration there tomorrow i
of Mexico's national holiday commem- :
r
orating the declaration of her inde
pendence and the throwing off of
Spanish rule. They will return Mon
day when the conferences will be re
sumed. While the attitude of General Bliss
as expressed to the commissioners
here, has not been revealed, it Is be
lieved he shares the views of many
army officers familiar with the bor
der situation that no satisfactory solu
tion can be found that is not based
upon the establishment and mainte
nance of a stable government in Mex
ico. Even the project of forming a
border police force to be jointly sup
ported by the two governments is
open to the objection, as it is pointed
out that no matter what plan might
bo employed to administer its affairs
and direct its movements, its joint
character would be hard to maintain.

The railway station at Bapaume was
also successfully bombed, much rail
