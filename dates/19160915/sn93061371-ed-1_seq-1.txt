MOLLY S FLANS
By CATHERINE CRANMER. T
"Good morning;, family!" was Moi-
Sle's cheery greeting as she entered
be breakfast room. "Mother o' mine,
let's go away fox a month. You know
it .will rain all through March, and
rain makes me weep more than the
clouds."
"Mollle Alns worth! Of all the short
sighted creatures; you are the most
hopeless!" Her mother looked discon
solately at the girl as she spoke.
"With the most eligible man in town
ready to drop at your f)et and with
the two most attractive debutantes
cancelffig trips to Palm Beach and
Aiken for fear you'll capture him
while they're gone, you want to go
away to escape the March rains."
"Now, mother, dear, you're a Jeal
ous, painstaking mother for a debu
tante, and you're on the Job every
minute. But come on, family, let's all
take A vacation from our several professions,"
begins next Tuesday. Each
day has brought additional en
couragement from every sec
tion both as to. attendance ai.d
exhibits.
An enormous fcrco of men
have been at work on the fair
grounds all week gluing every
thing in shape for the opening.
A number of features have been
added to the amusement pio-
gram and there will be pome
thing of interest going on f rom
nine o'clock in the morning un
til late in the evening.
The ra'c'es-Wil) te especially
good this year, more than twice
as many horses being entered
as have ever been on the Ros
well fair grounds before, and
the best stables in the southwest
are represented-; Each night
during tha week the Elks Hap
py Land will arflu'se the people
down town. With attractive
electrical effects this is said to
be the greatest collection of
amusement features ever assem
bled in New Mexico.
The Eastern New Mexico
Swine Growers Association will
have a banquet Tuesday night
and on Wednesday night the
Houtheaetern New Mexico Cat
tle Raisers Association will have
a banquet. Excellent programs
have been arranged for each of
these events.
The establishing of an infor
mation bureau in the down
town district assures every vis
itor of receiving comfortable ac
comodations at reasonable
prices, even though Roswell is
expecting twice as many people
as she has ever euteitained at
one lime before.
Child Comes Near Drown
ing. On Tuesday morning the t ao
year old-child of Mr. and Mrs.
James W. Davis 4f Judson,
narrowly escaped death by
drowning.
When the children came in nt
noon, Mrs. Davs missed the
youngest, and immediately run
to u large drinking tank where
she found it in almost the last
stages of drowning. Colin
Wilt-on was passing at the time
and assisted Mrs, Davis in re
suscitating the child.
At last reports the child,
though very weak, was recovering.
I She' included her mother and father
' in a wheedlliiK glanca.
J "As for that eligible man other-
, wise known as Leslie Morehouse
, he's already proposed and I've told
him It's too sudden."
I "And as sure as you live one of
those other girls will catch Ix;slie
j Morehouse on the rebound. Oh, I
know men!"
"They'll have to catch him on the
run instead of on the rebound, I'm
thinking," laughed Mollle, "as he is
leaving today for parts unannounced
on a hunting trip."
"Would you mind telling me what
you mean by turning down the catch
of the season?" asked her mother,
with mock calmness.
"I mean Just what I told him, though
I softened It a bit, for when I saw him.
with his society manners off and his
hourt manners on, he did seem pretty
nice." Molly blushed a bit, but added:
"But don't look so solemn, mother. I'm
still 'one and twenty with bcaus a
plenty.' And, daddy, throw down your
paper and let's all plan out some nice
trip for fun Instead of for form. Aiken'
and Palm Beach are disqualified, for
what we need is some secluded spot
whore we can talk common sense with
each other and with our souls and
come back home better acquainted." .
"That does sound like common
sense, and I've got a suggestion to
make about where to go."' lier father
was suddenly enthusiustic. "One of
my clients hus been after me for years
tt go out and enjoy the big fireplaces
and armchairs and first editions and
mountain scenery of his ancestral
homo that he occupies only about two
months in the year."
A few days later they made the pro
posed trip. After their first, evening
before a wood fire in a huge fireplace,
where all Of the-family grew remlnla
cent and sympathetic, and the eve
ning ended with Mollle playing softly
on the big pluno while all ot them
joined in singing old folk song's.
As for Mollis, she reveled in tha
many delights of tha big house, the
wonderful view from Ha broud win
dows and the quaint caretakers. She
did not even mind when a drizzly day
carnG. In tlio afternoon, she put on a
long corduroy coat and a Tuzzy yellow
scarf and cap and v.ut out for a walk.'
As she descended a hill toward the
tumbling mountain stream she
caught a glimpse, through an opening
ifl th trees, of some wild ducks on
the" water, Very cautiously she went
down toward tha river bank, but the
elusive ducks bud sailed around a
brnd, and to widen her vision sha
stepped Out on the edge of a wet and
slippery rock. At sight of her, tha
ducks first huddled and then rose in
graceful flight, but suddenly aattored
in confusion as shots cracked from a
clump of shrubbery further up thu
stream.
Mollle gave a start of surprise at
the first shot, lost her balance and,
with a frightened scream, fell into
the water, in her heavy long coat sha
was unable to make a good stroke and
promptly went under. She came up
still more frightened as she felt tha
strong force of the current. She loBt
consciousness as she went under the
second time without noticing that two
men wore running toward her from
where the rifle shots had been heard.
When she regained consciousness
she was being curried up the bill by a
big, strong man, whoso face was not
visible to her until, in response to her
tired exclamation, ho bent over her
and she recognized Leslie Morehouse.
"Mollle, dear," he whispered, and
Mollle replied with a long sigh of con
tentment. A half hour later both of them were
in dry clothes and sitting before the
big fireplace. Mr. and Mrs. Aiiisworth
left the room to give orders for au
early supper uud a big tire lu the dining-room
llreplace, and Morehouse
got up and stood behind the high,
wing-backed tapestry armchair in
which Mollle But. Then he leaned
ovgr and looked Into her fuce, speak
ing very softly to her.
"Hasn't this condensed our ac
quaintance enough to put us nearer
the time when you wRl give me the
answer you withheld the other day!"
"Ye-es," came Mollle's answer, "and
I believe that whatever of our society
veneer was not washed away by that
cold water has been melted by this
darling fire."
