The ocean is Hmooth.
When the Congress first came with

MUST STAND UNITED
TO DEFEAT GERMANS
French Premier Briand
Lays Stress on Fact All
Allies Are Together.
PARIS. Sept. 14. (11:10 p. m.)
In addrcsdng the chamber of dep
uties on the military and dlplomatlo
sil nation Premier Briand this af
ternoon laid stress upon the close co
operation among the entente allies
ugUnat tholr common foe.
"Tho allies, putting their efforts In
common, combining and co-ordinating
them In closo collaboration,
have determined upon an evolution
of the war along these lines. The
Germanic empires find themselves
reduced to tho defensive. The Initio,
tlve of the operations has escaped
them."
After reference to tha natural rea
sons for Rumanian Intervention Pre
mier Briand referred to the army at
Snlonlkl as follows:
In close union with "our efflrts, the
armies of Silonlkl will fulfill the mis
sion confided to them. Alroady on
that front as on others, the action is
developing, according to the plans of
the general stiffs. The action of tho
allies will be developed In all ways
necessary to dissipate the oriental
dream of the central empires."
Because of tho Bulgarian Invasion
of Greek territory without resistance
from the Greeks and corruption, and
espionage organized in Athens by
German agents, continued Premier
Briand, the entente allies were led to
take or required to be taken measures
Indlspenslhle for the security of their
troops, giving their assurance that
their action was In no wlso hostile to
the Greeks.

OF ROBBING BANK
John Schunenian and J. II.
Letternian Get 15 Years
in Criminal Court.
VERDICT IN AN HOUR
Men Fought Case Hard,
After Making Confession
to Officers Here.
JOHN SCHl'NEM AN and J. H. Let
terman were found gutlty of rob
bing the Bank of Red Fork by a Jury
In the district court yesterday after
noon and sentenced to serve five years
each In the state penitentiary. The
Jury was out of the courtroom but an
hour.
Dosplte the fact that Schuneman
liad signed a confession that he robbed
the bank with Letternian and that
overtures had been made Jo the court
by a person interested In tnelr cases
to allow them to plead guilty and ac
cept sentences of five years, the de
fendants pleaded not guilty and the
trial consumed practically the entire
day.
The robbery occurred late one aft
ernoon last winter.
Garbed In cowboy style, the two
young men entered the bank and
stuck up the president, It Is claimed.
They then grabbed up all the cash
In sight and escaped by driving out
of Red Fork with a team they had
taken from Tulsa, witnesses testified-
Sheriff Woolley nrrested the men.
Both men carried six-shooters and
hundreds of cartridges while the
money was found in their possession,
It Is sold.
Talked to Sheriff.
When the men were brought back
.here the same afternoon they talked
freely to Sheriff Woolley and Detec
tive Ed Egan of the robbery and
later Bohuneman signed a confession.
The defense In the trial was that
Schuneman and Letternian had seen
two men hiding money near the place
where they were found by the sheriff
and were digging It up when arrested.
Attorneys for the defendanta
pleaded with the Jury not to convict
them, declaring they were young men
and that their lives would be ruined
If they were sent to the penitentiary
Counsel declared that they had not
been positively Identified as the rob
bors by any of the witnesses.
County Attorney J. P. Evers made
an eloquent argument.
"Ther'e are two thieves and two
liars," he exclaimed at one point dur
ing his argument.
The case was given to the Jury
shortly before S o'clock and a verdict
had been reached within an hour.

NEW LONDON, Conn., Sept. 14.
MaJ. Gen. Tasker H. Bliss, as
sistant chief of staff of the I'nlted
States army. Is to appear before tho
American-Mexican commission tomor
row when dlHciiMson of border prob
lems Is renewed, lfe will bo the first
and possibly the only witness to be
interrogated by tho commission In
Joint session as It Is said to be the
desire of tho American commissioners
to expedite deliberations by keeping
tho door closed against an endless
suocesslon of persons who wish to be
heard. It was thought advisable that
General Bliss should explain In person
to the Mexican commissioners the
military aspects of border plans as
seen by I'nlted States army officials.
No definite plan for border patrols
hss been taken up in the minds of
iho commissioners. Tho Americans
coforred with General Bliss again
today.
For Borde r Constabulary.
It was Indlcat'cd that the proposal
which has appealed most strongly to
them was that a border constabulary
lie crented to operate as a police force
along both sides of the line. It was
suggested that the force be composed
of former soldiers of both countries
under Joint control and that the ex
pense be shared by both governments,
Details of the plan havo not been
worked out. In its favor, It was
argued that the Mexican people would
not feel towurd the constabulary the
same hostility that they dlspluyed to
ward the American troops which havo
crossed the line.
To Fse lollee.
It also was suggested that the police
force would be far more effective In
clearing tho mountains of northern
Mexico of bandits than either Mexican
or American troops. The Joint com
mission probably will adjourn tomor
row over the week-end to permit the
Mexican members to celebrate the
Mexican Independence dnjr, Septem
ber H.
In a statement Issued tonight the
following summary of today's pro
ceedings was given:
"Tho session was devoted to an In
terchange of views on the enforcement
of law in Mexico and on the guaran
tees to personal property rights. The
Mexican commissioners presented a
clear picture of tho purposes of the
Carranza government with reference
to the reform of the civil and criminal
codes and the codes of procedure.
They explained the fact that under
the Dial regime the Judicial procedure
was so cumbersome and expensive and
tho Judiciary so corrupt that It was
Impossible for a poor man to obtain
Justice."
"The purpose of the Carranza gov
ernment Is to so simplify procedure
thot tho cour's of justice will tie open
to nil and that tho personnel of the
Judiciary will be so carefully selected
that corruption and bribery will bo
completely eliminated. As soon as the
plan for tho revision of the constitu
tion has been carried out through a
constitutional con 'entlon, a thorough
going reform of the national codes
will be undertaken In order to make
these codes conform to the new
standards of Justice and equity to be
Incorporated In the constitution.
"The Mexican commissioners em
phasized tho faot thot the Carranza
government has no Intention of weak
ening the guarantees to civil rights
although the present abnormal con
dition of tho country has made It
necessary to suspend the constitu
tional guarantee In various sections of
the republic. In j'hort, tho purpose
which the Carranza government has
In mind Is to make not only the sys
tem of law, but the administration of
Justice conform to modern standards
and to incorporate the principle of
equality of opportunity In every de
partment of national life."

WASHINGTON.. Sept. 14. A new
world's record in navul gunnery has
been made by the now supardroad

ment announced tonight. Credit Is
given to tho big battleship's 12 14
Inch rlfleH, mounted as a main battery
In four turrets, which on a simul
taneous discharge In u recent trial
registered five hits on u small turgot
11 miles away. At that distance a
target Is not visible to the gunners.
The Pennsylvania Is tho rltst vessel
to have its entire main battery
mounted three guns to u turret and
nor performance Is deolurod by ord
nance and construction offleors to be
the final answer to orltlcs opposing
the three-gun turret system.
The Nevada and Oklahoma, also
new additions to tho navy, are
equipped with two three-gun and two
two-gun I Uriels. Neither of these
has been able to compete Willi the
Pennsylvania, although both made
unusually good scores during tholr

Several Hundred Young
sters Among ( 'lowd of
12.001) Attending.
CURTAIN WILL BE

Has Dccn bv Far Most Stu
pendous Kxliiliition
Held in State.
YOUTH was served Id coploua
quantities yesterday at tho Tulsa
county fair. It was children's day and
tho cup of each youngster from four
to thirty fairly ran over In the land
of wonder and enchantment enclosed
In tho circle of exhibit buildings be
decked with gay bunting and national
flags. Several hundred youngsters
rtguled in the amusements and dis
plays during the day and bringing to
a happy climax the greatest exhibition
of Its character ever seen In this state.
Tho third day of tho fair sot a mark
of 12,0(10 for attendance, at least 2,000
above tho highest record which was
made on the day previous.
From every standpoint tho occasion
was ideal. Unlike tho two previous
days thero was it sharp tang In tho
air, advance notice of approaching
autumn, which set tho blood a tingling
and gave Impetus to the restless
hordes which moved In and out and
around about tho grounds from 10
o'clock In the morning until lo o'clock
at night.
All for Children.
For the children of the county
future farmers, housekeepers, caltlu
men and good citizens officials had
expended their every effort to fur
nish a red letter day In their lives.
Kesldes the usual line of red lemon
ade, popcorn. Ice cream cones, colored
balloons, whips, noise-making uten
sils and odd embellishments, there
was the houest-to-gooilness vaude
ville, ueiiul stunts which made, one's
heart do a half flip once or twice, that
pretty little pony which did tricks ami
a band which played music which re
minded unii of pictures of George
Washington and Abe Lincoln. To be
suro the wind was too high for tho
balloon assenslon; nobody missed It
in tho niaulslroni of other good
things
As guests of honor they not only
attendee" throughout tho day the
lighter attractions but i: leaned soma
n. ul Instruct ion from the vaiied ami
euuci'tlcnul showings In the different
buildings. Interesting lectures, educa.
tional displays and attractive hoothd
proved equally as entertaining.
Put the children were not tho only
ones who hud a bully time. Of course,
the parents had to come along to
bring the children and the teachers
