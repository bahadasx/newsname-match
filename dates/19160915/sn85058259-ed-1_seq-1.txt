3 The prediction of The Record last
EL issue that Cedar City would be n very
j busy little city during the three days
m of the County Fair, which opened on
K last Tuesday and closed yesterday, was
m verily fulfilled, for it is doubtful if the
? town ever held more people at one
W time before; and it is certain that at
k no time in thojiast were there so many
P automobiles in evidence.
w The Fair went off peaceably and
f, the general verdict appeared to be
K, that it was an uncommonly good coun-
ty fair. There was some drinking, of
I. course, and a few men were seen who
appeared to be the worso for strong
I drink, but under the present laws we
had a right to expect nothing else.'
r Still, there wore no drunken brawls or
p or unsightly conduct.
." The races appeared to all be clean
I and run on merit. The first day they
t were very tardy in starting, but on
if subsequent days this feature was not
f nearly so noticeable. The ball games
f " were hard fought battles, and every
w' player, good or bad, did the best he
byte t , wbb capable of under the circumstnn-
BV: CeS
QHHff , The .New- Home for the Fair.
aWp''' - .The-new site for. holding the Fair
fW at Cedar City, which was placed in
p condition for the first time this year,
y, elicited many favorable comments.
& The grand stand is larger and more
t" pretentious than the county has ever
n k had before, and afforded better nc-
fkl-' commodations for seeing the sports.
1 f' The only objection made is its close
proximity to the cemetery. The fcu-
." ture of having the exhibits and sports
contiguous is a good one and proved
i popular with the people.
The Special Prize Winners.
Considerable interest was awakened
by the liberal special prizes offered
for agricultural and live stock exhib
its, tho winners of these prizes being

IRON COUNTY
TEACHERS MEET
First Session of Institute for School (
Year Held Today and Proves
Interesting and Valuable.
Iron County Teachers' Institute con
vened in the school building this morn
ing at 10 o'clock, with almost a full
enrollment of teachers in attendance.
After Prayer by Principal McAllis
ter of Cedar City, District Superin
tendent L. John Nuttall made some
very interesting and instinctive re
marks on "Plan Work" for the coming
season. One of the main questions
confronting the teachers of today is
the problem of Efficiency Essentials.
Teachers must know their pupils and
must know how to find out what they
know. The"succcssful teacher must
get his methods down to the real,
natural point of view.
The teacher should know his com
munity, he cannot run school effectu
ally without a community and school
organization. It is necessary to meet
parents on a common ground and work x
in co-operation together.
Principal Oberhaslie of Parowan
gave an Interesting paper on "Econ
omy and Education."
E. L. Clark of tho School Board
made interesting remarks?.
Lawrence J. Adams of Parowan
rendered two vocal solos in a very ef
fectual manner, accompanied by Mrs.
E. H. Macfarlane.
Afternoon Session.
Vocal Solo by Principal Oberhaslie.

remarks and Introduced Dr. M. J.
Macfarlane, who gave a most compie
hensive paper on Methods of Teaching
and the Garry System.
Mr. Jones of the Parowan school
read a paper on "Local Life."
Pros. U. T. Jones of the School
Board was next Introduced to the
teachers. He made a few pithy re
marks on the responsibility of teach
ers and recommended an economical
use of the supplies furnished by the
taxpayers of the county.
Pres. L. N. Marsden, one of the Par
owan members of the Board endorsed
the views of tho previous speaker and
spoke words of encouragement to the
teachers present.
The remainder of tho session was
consumed in the consideration of mat
ters of business pertaining to tho as
sociation. Institute adjourned to meet late in
October when it is expected some
members of tho State Board of Educa
tion will be present with other noted
educators.

third, $50. Tho Cedar City boys gave
the residue of their purse, after de
fraying expenses, to one of their play
ers who had the misfortune to dislo
cate his wrist.
On the third day of the fair Cedar
City, with three of tho Dixie team
substituted for other players, won
from tho Lund tenm on a score of 17
to 8. No purse for this game.
A pleasing feature of the fair was
a pnrade of the leading livestock ani
mals in the horso and cattle clnss,
which reflected credit upon tho county
as well as tho owners.
Next year tho County Fair will bo
held at Parowan.

(Crowded out last issue.)
Editor Iron County Record, Cednr
Citv, Utah. Dear Sir. Having been
sojourning in Emigration Canyon for
the last six weeks is tho reason why
I have not sent you this letter before.
Your paper of July 14th contnins
nnother letter from Mr. J. S. Wood
bury, fnvorintr a Public Utility, com
mission for Utah. In his letter Mr.
Woodbury does not give any specific
reason for such a commission. Will
Mr. Woodbury plenso givp one in
stance where we arc being overcharged
or robbed by any public utility in
Utnh, or where the service is poor or
inefficient.
A Little History.
In 189G, when Utah became a state,
tho general passenger rates on all
steam roads were from 5 to 6 cents
per mile and not very good service at
that. Today without any Public Util
ity Commission, -the rates arc 3 cents
per milo, nnd all freight rates have
been reduced as well, and the very
best of service. There were only threo
street car systems in Utah, two in
Salt Lake and ono in Ogden. The
street cars wero old and antiquated,
tho service poor, and the rates about
double what they nrc today. Trars
fers wero not issued between the two
systems in Snlt Lake. Our telegraph
service has been improved over COU
per cent and tho rates are much cheap
er, and our telephone rates are over
100 per cent cheaper than they were
in 189fi for tho service .rendered.
In 189G. when Utah became n stato,
Utah-made sugar was sold hero for
$4.05 per 100 lbs. and on that basis
the Utah Sugar company paid a divi
dend of 10 per cent and laid away an
other 10 per cent sinking fund, be
sides making great improvements in
their factory. On tho $4.65 basis the
Ogden factory was built, and it paid
a 10 per cent dividend the first year.
Since 1890, according to the "Sugar
Trust" statement, they are extracting
over 26 per cent more sugar from tho
beets than thev wero then; they arc
getting over 400 per cent more for
their pulp, and tho cost of making
sugar has been reduced over 33 per
cent, in spite of higher wages. And
from its rules In regard to topping,
hooking and elenning, beets are, not as
high in price now as they were in
1896. And with it all, Sugar in Utah
is about double tho prico that it was
in 1896.
Mr. Woodbury states that "all nec
essities should bo furnished the con
sumer at reasonable rates." Sugar is
an nbsolute necessity, every body uses
sugar every day. Not one person in
ten uses a public utility every day.
Now, Mr. Woodbury, if your mo
tives are pure and honest in urging a
Public Utility commission, why do you
not include In such a commission, ALL
UTAH CORPORATIONS?
If you nro so anxious to protect and
regulate the "actual necessities," why
not investigate tho creamery trust,
the milk trust, tho Utah fruit and
vegetable commission combine, the
snlt corporation, th'o beef trust, the
Salt Lake butchers and grocers asso
ciation; the master plumbers trust,
and last but not least, Utah wholesale
grocers combine? All of their prices
arc being iniscd year after year while
those of public utilities are being re
duced. NOW, MR. WOODBURY,
WHY?
Tho following from tho San Fran
cisco Chropiclo of AuguBt 22, speaks
for itself:
OUR MULTIFARIOUS
COMMISSIONS.
They are Political Machines Which are
Consuming tho Substnnco
of tho People.
"Whatever else they arc, there will
be none to deny that every ono of our
appointed Stato boards and commis
sions arc political machines whose
members spend prodigious amounts of
time paid for by the taxpayers, to say"
nothing of tho cost of 'official' trips
so plnnncd ns to put the right man in
tho right place when needed and all
to promoto tho political fortunes of
the appointing power.
"Few realize what these commis
sions cost. It appears that the rail
road commission alone cost the peo
ple of the state $670,000 for tho last
fiscal year.
"Its main work is in settling quar
rels between localities and industries
nnd in furnishing investors with In
formation which thoy would otherwise
hnvo to pay for themselves or go with
out. i Why should tho taxpayers pay near
ly three-quarters of a million dollars
a yoav for thoso purposes?

ations of tho railroad commission is
infinitesimnl. Thoy do not affect the
price which consumers pny for any
thing. They do very ilttlo, except
gather data for investors, which would
not get done if thoro were no such
commission, and probably got done
just ns well,
"And liko all other commissions, it
is a hotbed of politics.
It does not pny tho people to tax
themselves so heavily to accomplish
such work as tho Commission docs.
And, even if there were pecuniary
gain, it would bo far out-weighed by
tho moral injury Involved In support
ing such a powerful personal political
machine at tho taxpayers' expense.
Six hundred and seventy thousand
dollars a year la a lot of money to
spend for such a purpose.
"Doubtless tho Railroad Commis
sion costs tho people moro than any
other single commission, but all tho
others measuro up to the full limit
of their opportunities. Wo havo a
government of commissions and by
commissions nnd for commissions. Tho
Railrond commission is merely tho
most costly of tho loj;. All thnt is
necessary or desirable to bo accom
plished by all thoso commissions can
bo done at a vastly smaller cost to
tho taxpayers"
