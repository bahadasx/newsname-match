! London. When the full storv of the
or Is written It will have no more
spiring chapter than that which de-
rlbes the magnificent part the sons
if our noble houses have played In It
their devotion, their heroism, their
splendid deaths for the land they love,
ays a writer in London Answers.
Already, although the war has bare-
!y reached Its turning point, the list
if these heirs to coronets they will
never wear is appallingly long. Since
e master of Burleigh, eldest son of
id I'.alfour of Burleigh, as gallunt
a soldier us ever bore the historic
nam.' of Bruce, perished in the first
month of the war, nearly 50 peers have
lost the sons who ought to have suc
ceeded to their honors.
These heroes hove come from all
grades of our peerage. One of them
fwas heir to a dukedom, who, If he had
lived, would have been premier duke,
inniquls and earl of Ireland. Four
jwere sons of marquises, five had earls
ifor their fathers, seven were heirs to
viscounties and 29 were successors to
baronies. Six of them were the last
theirs to the family honors, and the
peerages which should have been
Ithelrs are now extinct.
The marquis of Lincolnshire, Lords
Knaresborough. Playfnire. Glbbesdale,
Bosmead and Stanford have now no
nelrs to follow them, though their sac
rtflce has not been so great as that of
(Lord Desborough, who has lost two

nine weeks of each other.

BEET SUGAR CROP LARGER I
Germany Expects Surplus If Feeding
to Cattle It Prohibited
Immediately.
The Hague. The prospect for this
year's sugar beet crop in Germany, ac
cording to a report In the Hanover
Courier, Justifies the expectation of a
surplus if the use of beets as fodder
for cattle Is prohibited Immediately.
The estimated production of sugar
beets for 1916 Is 88,000,000 hundred
weight, as compared with 29,000,000
tandredwelght In 1016.
The consumption of sugar beets,
which was 28,000,000 hundredweight
nnually before the war, Is sow much
lgher owing to the requirements of
the army and because sugar Is now
jwed Instead of butter Bad other fits,
nevertheless, tt ta calculated the pree

In his veins and proved himself a
worthy descendant of his ancestor. Sir
John Thynne, who won his knightly
spurs so valiantly on the field of Mus
selburgh more than three centuries
ago. Lord Bridgeport's heir, who gave
up his life one June day last year,
had In his veins the blood of England's
hero, Lord Nelson, and also 'of that
grand old sea dog, Sir Samuel Hood,
admiral of the Blue.
Lord Spencer Douglas Comptnn, son
of the marquis of Northampton, who
died a year ago, could look back to a
long array of fighting ancestors.
Generation after generation, the
Comptons were among the doughtiest
warriors of England. There was a
Compton In every battle in the Civil
wnr, Including the third earl, who
fought so bravely for their king at
Hdgehlll and Banbury and tn many an
other battle.
Lord Arthur Hay, heir to his brother,
the marquis of Tweeddnle, who died
in the second month of the war, had
one ancestor who fell on Flodden field,
and another who commanded a regi
ment at Marston Moor and Preston;
and Viscount Templetown's heir, who
died on Mny 9, 1915, hud many a war

that Upton who covered himself with
glory at the siege of Limerick undel

But among all these brave young no

their king and country there were
none braver thnn Lord Desmond Fitz

earl of Lelnster, whose death a few
weeks ago Is so widely deplored. Dying
nt the age of twenty-seven, Lord Des
mond had already written his name
large In the nnnnls of the gallant Irish
guards. In the scvero fighting In the
retreat from Mons he bore himself
most bruvely among the bravt, and In
all the later fighting his courage and
his reckless contempt of danger
amazed and Inspired the ranks.
Ho was twice severely wounded but
he laughed at his wounds and longed
only for a day when he could return
to his men. and It was a cruel strokf
of fate which, by the explosion of a
bomb at Calais, ended a life so full ol
achievement and promise.

Baseball Magnates Agitated Over Re
sult Likely to Follow When Wages
Aro Reduced Most of Trou
ble Be From Mouth.
One of the many questions agitating
the baseball powers that be is this:
Is there going to be any serious trou
ble when the salary cutting season
opens in the fall?-
Usually the pleasant autumnal
months have merely ushered In the
snlary boosting time. Particularly was
this true when the Federal league was
In Its heyday, picking all the peaches
from the O. B. bough that weren't
glued fast with higher salary cement
The winds that blew across the or
chard naturally boosted the total tn
the old pay envelope. But now that
the wind of competition is stilled uh,
me I these coming duys ure likely In
deed to be "the saddest of the year."
But what will happen when the
pruning knife is tuken In hand and
the farmers set In to work? If, as Is
reported, salaries are really to go on
the toboggan, there' bound to be trou
ble. Of course, most of the trouble
will be of the mouth variety. The
"foot" may be added to the "mouth"
disease. In some Instances. Where
there Is any doubt of the actual, real
value of a player as n drawing card,
he may find himself in the discard If
he raises too big a howl.
It is said that the players are up
to the minute prepared. From time
to time the members of the various
clubs have been meeting as the sched
ule has brought tbcm to New York,
and meeting not ouly themselves but
the managers of their own mutual pro
tection band. Just how many meet
ings there have been behind the mys
teriously locked doors I don't know,
nor do I know now far any associa
tion has been formed and plans laid.
CLASSY RIGHT-HAND PITCHER
Fred Toney of Cincinnati Is Ranked
With Alexander Performing in
Clever Fashion.
In Fred Toney, Manager Mathew
son of Cincinnati, has one of the class
iest right-handed pitchers in baseball,
a roan who ranks with Alexander in
effectiveness, and who will give the
Quaker star a run for pitching hon
ors In all likelihood this season.
Toney Is a Southerner, having been
born In Nashville, Tenn., 26 years ago.
He first began pitching regularly In
1900 with an amateur team known as
the Free Sliver Sluggers, In Nashville,
and lost but two games all year. The
following season he played seml
professlonnlly In Nashville, winning
20 out of 81 games. In 1908 he played
for a time with the Bowling Green

(Ky.) team, and In mid-season re
cetved a tryout with the Winchester
ciub of the Blue Grass league. He
made good and the following year was
the star of the league, though he didn't
advance. In 1909 he made such a
sensational record that the Philadel
phia Nationals obtained him snd
took him up at the close of the year.
He was shifted to Chicago, where he
played the following year, and after
a couple of seasons figured In anoth
er swap, this time to the Reds, with
whom he Is npw performing in brtl
llant fashion. .
Double-Play Record.
In the Memphis-Little Rock game of
July 16 seven double plays were made,
a record for the season. Last year tn

plays Were made, which so far at

OPPONENTS OF UNFAIR DELIVERY.
Charges that pitchers are making de
liberate use of the benn ball are flying
thick and fast in the American league.
In the opinion, of the majority It is
high time that the solons of baseball
took a decided stand In this matter and
promulgate a ruling, by which power
was vested In the umplre-ln-chief to
discriminate between a fast ball that
broke sharply at a batter and the de
liberate use of the bean, ball to drive
a dangerous man back from the plate,
says a writer in an exchange. A pitch
er declared guilty of the use of this
unfair, If not illegal, delivery should be
fined and suspended.
To be sure, tn the majority of cases
the hitting of a batsman. Is due to- ac
cident, but Just so long as one pitcher
Is accused of making use of such un
sportsmanlike tactics the batters
should be protected. Imagine a man
like Walter Johnson, Jeff Tesreau,
Grover Alexander or Jeff Phefler, the
PASSING OF CHARLEY DOQIN
Despite VI is Light Weight, He Caught
Wonderful Game of Ball Most
Accurate in Throwing.
The passing of Charley Dooln to the
Minors marks the retirement of nn
other veteran from the big show.
BanaegMannaBgEgQl
Charity Dooln.
Dooln started playing ball 18 years
ago. Dooln was the smallest oi an
the Major league catchers. When he
broke Into the big show he weighed 128
pounds, and today tips the scales at
about 150. Nevertheless, he caught a
wonderful game of ball, and was noted
for his accurate throwing to second.
Dooln Is well fixed financially, being
a shrewd Investor.
Compliment for Ping Bodle.
President Henry Berry of the Sen
Francisco club pays Ping Bodle some
compliment He said ne would not
tnd In the way of Ping going to the
majors next year, but that be would
refuse to trade him, because there
wasn't a playtr er two players tn the
majors who could be waived out that
would run one-two wtth Ping.

Roy Corhan. now with the Cardinals,
was hit on the head with a pitched
ball and' has been gun shy ever since.
His was forced to take a short trip to that
minor leagues because of his timidity,
at the plate. Walter Johnson almost
killed Jack Martin on the old Ameri
can league grounds several years ago
Roger Bresnahan was bit and
killed, but he was an exceptional i
with rare physical courake. When turn
recovered he plunged rust back Into,
the game as if nothing bad happened.
But many a good man has been driven
out of the game by being hit. Sam
have been permanently Injured.
John EInley Tener, president of
the National league, is bitterly op
posed to the use of the bean ball asxl
would gladly do his part la ruling it
right out of the game.
AOTES of the
DIAMOND
Seasonable maxim: "A bit in time
saves the nine."
Jimmy Johnston is making good
with a vengeance for the Dodgers.
Joe Jackson and Jack Ness are the1
only Sox players hitting over the J0f
mark.
Dave Robertson of the Giants was
the first National league player to-
get 100 hits.
Zwilltng should make good, for tbe
Indians as soon as he gets j used to
the high altitude. '
Manager Griffith of Washington has
decided to make an outfielder out of
Pitcher Sam Rice.
When the thermometer Is flirting;
with the 98 mark, ball players are to
favor of compulsory bathing.
Roger Pecklnpaugh does not hit aa
often as some of the other Yanks, but
his blows are usually timely.
The big question In Cincinnati
right now Is: Will Matty be able to
make good where Herzog failed?
If Larry Doyle Is going to do any
leading of the National league swat
ters this year he will have to get busy
pretty soon.
Philadelphia still has strong hopes
that the next world's series will be
played at the Bellvue-Stratford and
the Waldorf.
As It looks so far, the only presi
dent In the National league who
hasn't a chance for the pennant at
John R. Tener.
Hughle High, according to BUI
Donovan, Is one of the best defensive
outfielders In the major leagues and
he's hitting 280.
f
Height be said that sometimes a
manager makes an addition to his
team, and when It la too late finds oat
It was a subtraction.
Manager McOraw of the Giants bow
admits that the Robins are a dan
gerous flock of birds, but adds that
the admission la made In the bob
that It may prove Jinx to the Brook
lyn speeders,
