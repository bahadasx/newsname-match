KARSCH'S
Back From West
James Kelly, who left but a few
weeks ago for a visit with his son,
Robert E. Kelly, at Thernopolis, Wy
oming, expecting to stay in that coun
try anyway until spring, returned
Monday, accompanied by his son, who
has been gone from Farmington for
24 years. The weather there did not
agree with his father, who was glad
to get back to Farmington. Mr. Kel
ly had a very enjoyable month, how
ever, in viewing that vast country
and meeting with strange people. He
says that one of the things that most
impressed him was that practically
everyone he met with, throughout that
country, is enthusiastically in favor of
President Wilson for another term.
This general enthusiasm includes the
women, who are voters in that country.
During all the years of Kobert
Kelly's experience in tho far West,
this is the first visit he has made to
his old home. He was both surprised
and pleased with the many changes
and improvements that have occurred
during his ulmost a quarter of a cen
tury absence. But he, too, has pros
pered during his absence, and now
owns a large sheep ranch near Ther
nopolis. He will visit with old home
folks a month or more.
Stamp Act Repealed
The new revenue bill passed by
Business Change
A change in the ownership of the
Farmington Muling (Jo. occurred re
eently, the change in the manage
ment dating from Sept. 1st. The in
terest in this splendid milling con
cern which was formerly owned by
Charles Giessing, Sr., and li. W. bles
sing, has passed into the hands of
John Giessing and his two sons, P. D.
and, C. H. Giessing, and the business
will be conducted practically in the
same manner as heretofore.
The amount of money involved in
this transfer has not been made pub
lic, but it runs up into many thou
sands of dollars. This excellent pro
perty is now entirely owned by a sin
gle family. C. H. Giessing, one of
the new owners, has for a number of
years been employed in the Bank of
Farmington. He has resigned his
position there, which will take effect
soon, and he will then give his en
tire time to looking after the milling
business. P. D. Giessing, the other
son, who is now one of the owners of
the business, has been employed in
the mill for a number of years, and
is an experienced miller, as is also
the lather, John Giessing, who has
been a partner in the business for
many years.

FARMINGTON PAGEANT
A GLITTERING SUCCES
2,000 People Attend First Performance
Grand Concert To-Night at 8
0'Clock Pageant Repeated
Saturday Night
Unfortunate Affair
Republicans Speak
The family and friends of Miss Mar
tha McCormick, daughter of Dr. E. C.
McCormick, who was staying in St.
Louis with Mrs. Albert C. Sellner,
4540 Duncan avenue, were very much
distressed over the report of her dis
appearance from the place where she
was stopping, since the preceding
Sunday. Her elder brother from
here and brother-in-law from Chica
go went to St. Louis to institute a
search for her. Last Thursday they
found her at 4500 Duncan avenue, a
few, doors from where she had been
staying, in company with a young
man named Junius Mulholland and
another young man and woman.
Young Mulholland said it was their
intention to get married, and it is said
proposed to make his intention good
at once, but Miss McCormick was
taken away by her brother and brother-in-law.
The two young men were locked up
pending application for a warrant,
and the city papers were full of the af
fair, each giving different versions as
the reporters would pick up scraps
from this source and that, all sensa
tional and suggestive in character.
On Saturday morning the two young
men were released, as Circuit Attor
ney Thomas refused to prosecute on
the evidence offered. In some of the
reports it was suggested that the
young woman had been enticed to the
house where they were found, and
drugged or forced to remain. Mul
holland denied this and declared his
intention of marrying her. Circuit
Attorney Thomas, according to one
of the papers, corroborated a part of
this statement, that Miss McCormick
had told him she went to the Duncan
avenue address of her own accord,
and that she could have departed at
any time had she desired.
After his release Mulhollnnd, who
is said to be 21 years of age and re
ported to have considerable menns,
which, however, are yet in the cus
tody of his guardian, insisted that he
was still determined to marry Miss
McCormick as soon as he could find
her in the face of all opposition; that
"if her brothers had allowed US' to
get married when they found us to
gether, as we had intended doing,
Martha's name would have been
saved all this scandal.
It is a distressing and unfortunate
escnpaae 01 two tnougntitss young
people, and let us hope that their
family and friends may place the
most charitable construction upon
their indiscretion and forget it.
When some of the enterprising, ed by
wide-awake men' and women of dren.
Farmfhgton a couple of months ago Then
conceived the idea of getting up a
historical pageant in our town, they
were aware that it was no small un
dertaking, but despite discouraging
predictions of failure, they wenc to
work to show that it could be donp.
Last night's performance fully justi
fied their confidence, for the produc
tion was a decided success. About
2,000 people from all parts of the
joyous, lively, beautiful chil-
as a grand finale, the whole
Pageant of Indians, Spanish, French,
Pioneers and children, march in re
view tm th and back across the wide
stage, pusenting a beautiful and im
posing picture.
Ncurly 200 men, women and chil
dren a:e engaged in presenting this
spectacular pageant, and to Mrs.
Frank S. Weber, who was hannilv
Selected at Pageant Director, i due
of the
words of commendation and appre
ciation were heard on all sides. Each
scene, as the picture was unfolded,
was greeted with applause.
As the "prologue" of the "Farm
ington Pageant" book expressed it:
This is a Pageant of history,
A story of centuries past,
A tale of brave deeds and of legend,
Of great men whose names were writ
fast
In gold in the annals of fame.
The stage setting was splendidly
arranged. It covered a space of over
a hundred feet in width and depth on
the Ozark Athletic Field, set off with
forest trees. On this stage an ani
mated picture of real life was pre
sented. The first scene was an In
dian village, with a native festival in
progress. A number of braves are
seen dancing around a camp fire, the
squaws and children squatting about
the tepees watching the quaint In
dian dancers. A ecout comes run
ning in, gesticulating, and gives an
alarm: "The pale face! the pale face!"
The dancing abruptly ceases and con
sternation marks the faces of all.
Spanish music is heard in the dis
tance and soon DeSoto and some of
his followers enter upon the scene.
They are received, with every ap
pearance of misgiving, but advances
are made on the part of DeSoto and
his men; the pale faces bring presents
of trinity .",d in sign language a
friendly reeling is established, the
first Christian cross is raised and the
Spanish nag is hoisted, while Indians
and Spaniards unite in chants and
hymns. The scene fades away by
means of well arranged disappearing
lights, and an idyllic scene comes in
to view: "Evangeline and Basil, ac
companied by an Indian guide, in
search of Gabriel."
A third scene follows, representing
the time of the memorable year 180,'i,
when the Louisiana Purchase was
consummated. The Spanish flag
floats over the scene, and a beautiful
dance is staged in which sixteen
young women as Spanish signoritas,
scene-;, and her ait'gtic "onreotion
and executive direction in carrying out
the whole schema is universally con
ceded aid appreciated. Everybody
connected with the. affair is to be
congratulated, a .d to them ali Farm
ington ewes a debt of apprecianon
for a delightfuj, festal season.

William Sullivan, aged 25 years,
shot himself in the forehead Sunday
afternoon and died a few hours after
he fired the shot. He had been in
poor health for some time and it is
thought that this must have been the
cause of his ending his life. He was
an industrious man of good abits, and
lived with his father on Federal Hill.
The funeral services were held in the
Bap: ist church on Monday afternoon.

banner waves where the tri-color held
sway for a breath of time. "Ameri

Nelson leading. Throughout the
scene were dances and games of the
countries from which the early pi

young women and bright-faced chil
dren, all of whom have been splendid

captivated the delighted audience.
The fourth scene opened with a
covered wagon and team driven onto
the stage. From the wagon Mrs.

$200 Corn Premium
The management of the St. Louis
agricultural Fair, which will be held
on Oct. 2nd to 7th, 1916, offers a cash
premium of ?200 for the best bushel
of corn that will be exhibited. Some
corn grower in St. Francois county
may be able to secure this premium.
Even an attempt to do so would be
commendatory.
This Fair is also offering many
other splendid prizes on agriculture,
horticulture and live stock. A re
