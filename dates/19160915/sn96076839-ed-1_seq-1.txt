Good Roads
Were Discussed
At Our County Fair Last Thurs
day Afternoon.
One of the extra features of our Fair
last week was an address given by H.
D. Rpardman of Jackson on "Good
RoauS," with introductory remarks by
Geo. H. Van Pelt of Charlevoix.
Mr.' Van Pelt said:
It has been my good fortune to have
lived at Norwood in this county for
thirty-four years. I have seen her fine
forests of hardwood cut down and the
land by degrees transformed into farms.
When I was a boy, I lived on a farm'
and have always had a soft spot in my
heart for farm life and in a quiet way I
have tried to make my farm friends see
wherever they could better their condi
tions. When the clearings were small,
I showed them how they could insure
their winter's supply by planting on
the road sideshow they could improve
their farms by keeping cattle and sheep
because we all know we can't always
keep taking out from anything and
havMt makr good, without we put
scraHhXng irj It is exactly the same
vlJ ra farm as it is with a bank, but
-sy thv greatest gain of all is in good roads.
""This I hve talked for 3-f years and with
the tuto'Voming, we had better roads
than any of the countys about us.
Now, the time has come for us to
make them better stillj because we
have learned that the very best maca
dam roads that can be built will not
stand the wear and tear of the big
autos. They have utterly destroyed
the value of the nine foot gravel roads
that were built lat year and this shows
that it is a waste of money to build any
more of our main roads with gravel.
There is only one road that will stand
this great strain and that is concrete
and now it has to be and is admitted by
all who use the roads either by auto or
wagon.
So I have taken the liberty of invit
ing a young friend of mine to come up
and speak ta- you these four days of
our County Fair. He was born on a
good macadam road, but when arrived
at years of maturity and began to fight
the battlek of life, he found many boul
ders, washouts and thank-you-mams
in the road and he began to labor for
himself and for his fellow men. lie
soou became a concrete "crank". Con
crete is a good strong mix and conveys
the idea of great strength strength of
character, strength to build on. Con
cretely, to be concrete, why, you have
to be. loyal to your concrete ideas or
his concrete ideas.
He will now express to you in better
language than I can but he don't
understand the great benefit of concrete
roads one bit better than I do you
s4on learn that he is a concrete hustler
from Hustleville, Hustle County.
Permit me to introduce to you Mr.
Harry D. Doardraan, who will now tell
you much about concrete roads.
DO WE NEED GOOD ROADS?
(Why Bobby, Answering the Lure of
Travel, Climbed a Tree to View Distant
Lands in the Next Lot, and How He
Learned His First Lesson on the Ad
vantages of Traveling on a Good Road.)
When Bobby climbed a tree in his
back yard to get a glimpse of foreign
lands beyond the hill, he unconsciously
answered the call of the road. IJe
wanted to travel; later the lure of the
road still pulling, he sallied forth like a
valiant knight of old, riding a stick
horse, made a gallant dash of many
leagues across the pasture, took mental
notes on the new land, put the lash to
his steed, and was back to the kitchen
door in time for supper, travel worn,
and hungry. He tracked up the kitchen
with his muddy boots and got spanked
and thereby learned his first lesson on
the advantages of traveling on a good
road.
Not every one of course is interested
in Bobby and his earlier travels, but we
thought that perhaps you might be
interested, so we . have used in an
illustrative way, this incident from a
little boy's life an incident which
you can match in .your own life to lure
yoKv to reading the answer to the
question:
"Do we need good roads?"
It should be unnecessary to ask a
question like this in any community in
the United States today. We should be
V4far ahead of that stage in community
building, that to ask , that question
would at once mark our own position
far back In the ranks of citizenship.
However that nay be, we must ask the
"limbered up." Our roads are the
bolts and pulleys in . this machinery.
They transmit our social, educational
and agricultural power. If these belts
and pulleys are "girmmed up" they
pull slowly and irregularly, aud our
social, educational and agricultural life
is "gummed up" in like proposition.
There is no escaping this truth.
We know that travel educates, but
too often we use the word travel in the
sense that we nust get wayoff yonder
somewhere before the education begins
to "step in," when as a matter of fact
the need for travel is right here at
home.. We need closer communication
need to know each other better; and
there is nothing in this world which
will more quickly break down the
barriers of isolation and the monotony
of the farm than - easy and smooth
traveling.
We do need good roads.
There is really no reason to argue on
this subject among ourselves. This
need is a fact a fact as hard and as
solid as a concrete road. But we do
heed to have impressed upon our minds
the intensity of this need for better
highways and to have this need ipi-
pressed so deeply that we will act in
stead of talk, and thus put our com
munity on the basis, as financiers
would say, of a going concern. If we
continue to talk without action, good
roads in our community will be as in
definite and distant as the milky way.
The history of man is the record of
man's struggle against nature. Slowly
he "has loosed the bonds that have held
him at the mercy of his foes. But we
who are yet living on bad roads are
bound hand and foot while the ele
ments play about us. When the rains
come we are stuck fast in the mud,
blocked from the markets and from the
profits which would be ours but for our
own stupidity.
If we are not going to build modern
highways, get out of the mud and con
nect up with the outside world on hard
surface roads, we would display wisdom
by turning back to cave days and 'hole
up,' n)t for the winter, but for eternity
so far as our community life is con
cerned. Rut we started out, you say, to hang
this discussion on this peg:
"Do we need good roads?"
Yes, we do.
We need good roads if we are going
to add interest to life in this communi
ty. To add interest, make the most
profit from our farms, and hold our
young people, we must keep in line
with other communities. This is not
mere talk repeated so many times that
you may throw it aside as amounting to
nothing. It is important enough to
warrant sending a corps of bell ringers
through the skies, if we could, to wake
up to a realization of the fact that our
work on our particular patch of the
earth's surface, is how to get the most
out of life social, educational and
agricultural. And the only way to do
that effectively is to buiid good roads..
The evolution of highways parallels
the evolution of the whole scheme of
transportation. Early methods of trans
portation depended upon oxen, teams
and horses. Better vehicles demand
ed better roads and the automobiles
has been the greatest factor in compell
ing the permanent paved highway.
Both have made the office, store and
factory so accessible to the rural home
that people have jnoved still farther
away from the congested districts of
the city, necessitating still greater de
velopment or the rural highway.
A hundred years have passed since
the National Pike demonstrated that a
better road is a stimulus to better
fences, better barns, better houses,
better people, and better land values
along its course. Corresponding con
ditions rule today, even though modern
traffic conditions have made it neces
sary to rehabilitate the National Pike
in part by the use of concrete pave
ment. Statistics show that at least 70 per
cent of the automobiles manufactured
recently have found their way to the
country, hence the rural dweller has
not only been given the opportunity,
but developed a greater desire to travel
today than ever before. Moreover, he
has seen good roads and now appreci
ates the absolute necessity for them,
and for their further extension in his
community.
One of the most recent proofs of why
we should have better roads comes
from Ohio, where highway enthusiasts
point to the fact that those counties
where roads have not been improved
have lost population, while on the
other hand counties that have modern
ized their roads have grown in popula
tion and land values have arised.
The U. S. Department of Agriculture
has found that in Spottsylvania County,
Virginia, from an investment of $100,
000 to improve 40 miles of road the
results were most surprising. Two
years after completing this road the
railroad shipped from Fredericksburg,
the county seat, during a period of
twelve months, 71,000 tons of products
of the soil, hauled over the improved
highway to that town. Before the im
provement had been made the total
was only 29,000 tons annually the
result of a better highway to the rail
road. Results equally as startling were
shown in the quantity . of dairy pro
ducts. In 1909 these amounted to" 114,
815 pounds, in 1911 they had risen to
253,028 pounds an increase of prac
tically 140 per cent in two years.
Summing up the answer to our ques
tion, a portion of a speech made not
long ago by Governor Ralston of
Indiana, may be quoted:
"Transportation means commerce;
commerce means a better under
standing between the people, the
more people trade with one another,
the more they appreciate their inter
dependence upon one another and
interdependence In the end breeds
neighborhood and closer fellowship.
People living ten miles apart without
any means of transportation connect
ing their respective communities are
strangers, though they are citizens of
the same county, whereas, people
living twenty-five miles apart with
their respective localities by an easy
means of transportation are friends,
and by their personal contact with
one another, each gives the other an
impetus in life which minimizes self
ishness and magnifies good will
among men. And thus it is that high
ways and transportation no longer
separate farms and neighbors, they
connect them. A road is a tie that
binds and the longer the road the
more far-reaching is its binding and
brother making power."
The time has come where we must
have good roads whether we want
them or not. If we do not want them
we will be left far behind in the march
of progress. The .dilapitated looking
farm with a good road passing it will
soon be a thing of the past. Such
farms will soon be found only in the
back hills, remote from good roads.

Paid to Prevent Diseases
In certain parts of Cuba a physician
is paid to keep the patient well and not
to cure him if he gets sick. It is a very
desirable method and is modeled some
what after the system used in a num
ber of European countries, where the
income of the physician decreases in
ratio to the prevalence of disease.

BROME GRASS
EXHIBIT AT
COUNTY FAIR
In the exhibit of the Agriculture De
partment of the East Jordan High
School at the Charlevoix County Fair
last week a premium of $1 was offered
for the correct name of the grass ex
hibited there. The correct name of
this is Brome Grass which was guessed
correctly by four people: Wm. Sever
ance, Leonard HiteC. J. Malpass and
Wm. Kenney.
This grass drew considerable atten
tion and a description of it is given
herewith:
Brome grass is a native of Europe,
from which country iP was introduced
into the United States at a comparative
ly recent date. It is a deep-rooting,
stoloniferous grass, with an abundance
of root leaves and a good supply of
stem leaves. The stems are erect,
from 1 to 4 feet tall, bearing a
spreading head from G to 10 inches
long. The grain or seed is about one
fourth of an inch in length and is
brown in color.
Brome grass is of such recent intro
duction into this country that its value
is not yet well understood. It seems
to be unquestionable the best tame
pasture grass for the Great Plains re
gion and the Pacific Northwest, anoflt
is of more or less value throughout the
North Central and Northeastern states.
Its numerous deep roots enable it to
withstand drouth better than any of
our other cultivated grasses, which ex
plains its value in the Great Plains and
Intermountain districts. It has been
cultivated for many centuries in south
ern and central 'Russia, in a climate
very similar to our Great Plains region.
The method of seeding is not differ
ent from that which is common with
timothy. It soes much better on loam
or clay soils than on those of a sandy
nature. It grows fairly well on sandy
soils, however, when once established,
the difficulty being to prevent injury
from blowing sands until a sod is form
ed. The usual rate of seeding is from
15 to 20 lbs to the acre when sown
alone; when sown in a mixture, G to 10
lbs are sufficient.
The best use of brome grass is for
the production of pasturage in the
Great Plains ahd Rocky Mountain
states. It is useful there also as a hay
grass, particularly for the first two
years after seeding, for it produces an
abundance of hay until it becomes sod
bound. It is one of the most palatable
of grasses, cattle eating it in preference
to blue grass. It is also of value in
improving worn-out lands, since it pro
duces a large quantity of stems and
roots and adds materially to the vege
table matter in the soil.
In permanent brome grass meadows,
the sodbaund condition which is likely
to develop may be prevented by
thorough disking without plowing at
intervals of a year or two. Pastures
will also be improved by disking.
In sowing brome grass care should
be taken to obtain seed which is free
from crack grass. Seed samples may
be sent for analysis to the Agriculture
Department of this High School or to
the Botany Dept. of the Michigan Agri
cultural College.

Hints for Housewives
For dishcloths, sew two little salt
bags together. They will last longer
than the ordinary ones.
Marks on paint, made by scratching
matches, can be removed by rubbing
with a cut lemon.
When slices of cold boiled ham are
to be used for sandwiches, they should
be shaved rather than sliced.
To heat dishes quickly, don't put
them in a hot oven, but let them lie for
a minute or two in hot water.
In cooking fruit, it takes nearly twice
as much sugar to sweeten if added be
fore cooking. Cook first, then sweeten
to taste.
The very best ham sandwiches are
made with hot tea biscuits cut in two,
buttered, and spread liberally with
minced or chopped ham.
Tea and coffee stains may be taken
from white goods, by soaking in gly
cerine and letting stand several hours
untouched, afterward washing in soap
and water.
New Use For Orange Peel
Orange peel is now used as a simple
laxative. Fresh orange peel is boiled
and the first bitter infusion poured off;
then it is boiled again in a slightly
sweetened water, for about half an
hour. After it has dried it is ready for
use, the dose being the peel of a whole
orange.

Should Command Attention
"THE GIRL WITHOUT A CHANCE"
which comes to the Temple Theatre
next Tuesday, Sept. 19th is said to be
one of unusual interest in every parti
cular. It possesses every element to
stir the interest of the audience and at
times creates in them unparalelled
enthusiasm. The story pictures in the
first act a little home in Italy, which is
visited by a couple of American tour
ists. The girl becomes infatuated with
one of them which results in her down
fall. The American deserts her and
returns to his own country where
twenty years afterward he comes in
contact with a daughter of his unfor
tunate victim. He is then a leading
character in the police department and
very closely allied to the underworld.
Many of such characters figuring
prominently in the play. There is a
vein of humor running all through it
serving excellently to relieve the in
tensity of the dramatic situation. A
story like this is bound to get the at
tention of all lovers of drama.
Rapid Growth of the
Railwaymens Relief Ass'n.
Both of the members of the East Jor
dan Division No. 24. of the Railway
men's Relief Ass'n of America, Erie
Farmer and Rudolph Best of this city
have been elected as delegate and al
ternate respectively to the tenth
annual convention of the order to be
held at Muskegon, Mich., Oct. 3rd and
4th.
This association was founded in a
switchingmen's shanty in the North
Yards in Muskegon and for several
years its operations were limited to
employes of the Pere Marquette road.
The scope of the organization soon ex
tended, however, and before many
years elapsed it was growing so rapidly
that it was with difficulty that the
scores of trainmen seeking member
ship in the order were accomodated.
No part of the organization's opera
tions are for the purpose of profit in
any shape, the sole object of the
society being the general protection of
all trainmen and their advancement in
every possible way. Railway employes
are officers Of the association, which
aids in cases of sickness, accident or
death. At the present time the mem
bership of the society totals . nearly
100,000 employes.
