OLD ALEXANDER MINE NEAR BERLIN
RESUMED TODAY AFTER 25 YEARS
W. J. Webster and a group of
capitalists interested In explosives
have taken over the old Alexander
Mining company group of claims at
Grantville, six miles south of Berlin,
In Nye county. The fact was not
commonly known until recently when
it was learned that the new syndicate
had been engaged lor nearly two
'years in overhauling the mine and
mill with the Intention of placing the
property In a high stage of produc
tion. The Alexander was operated
between 1877 and 1885 under direc
tion of A. B. Cooper, president and
general manager, and Manual San
Pedro, superintendent. The company
erected a 20 stamp mill and equipped
the mine with the most substantial
machinery at a cost that was esti
mated to be not less than $265,000.
These days may suggest that the
price was pretty steep to pay for a
comparatively small plant, but it was
reasonably economical when it Is con
sldered that all freight was teamed
In from Wadsworth, on the Central
racinc, ana cost laid down at the
mine five cents a pound. Salt for
treating the ore was brought from
the salt marsh between Fallon and
Wonder. After the equipment was
completed the company found the ore
was so rerractory that It was not
amenable to the processes known in
those days and In consequence much
of the most valuable ore had to be
left standing fa the slopes. Notwlth
standing this rebellious element, the
company operated on hlghgrade for
long time and shipped tons of
bullion. The ore contained silver,
i i
u, zinc and antimony. The old
Brooklyn, a famous gold property
aujoins the Alexander.
The property finally drifted Into the
hands of the Hornsllver Mining com
pany, of Utah, and lias remained Idle
.ever since. The Webster sVnrli,..
since taking over the Alexander have
completely remodeled the mill by
putting in a cyanidlng plant and
crushing and leaching devices for ex
tracting a high percentage of the
values. It Is estimated that the
dumps carry over 100,000 tons that
will run between $15 to $25, of which
over 90 per cent may be recovered.
J. Wesley Stewart 1b associated with
Mr. Webster and both gentlemen left
this morning In the Stewart car to
witness the starting of the plant.
Twelve men are employed and the
number will be Increased.
