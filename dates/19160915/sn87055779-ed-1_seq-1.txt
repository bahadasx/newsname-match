COMMISSION NOT TO
MEET ON SATURDAY!
Still Deadlocked in Trying to
Fix Responsibility For
Columbus Raid and
Two Fights.
International News Service:
WASHINGTON, Sept. 15. Offic
ial dispatches to the state depart
ment today confirmed reports leak
ins across the border that Francisco
Villa is preparing to attack Chihua
hua City tomorrow, a Mexican holi
day. The dispatches, the rource of
which was not announced, states
that Villa had congregated a large
force in Chihuahua state, giving the
first official confirmation to reports
that his operations are beins con
ducted on a large scale.
Intrrnatioual News Service:
NEW LONDON, Conn., Sent. 15.
Final agreement on a border pro
tection program was brought much
closer today at the conference of the
American and Mexican commission
ers. When the Mexican representa
tives have been persuaded to agree
that the joint international police
shall have the power to exterminate
brigands in a neutral strip of north
ern Mexico, the last obstacle in this
phase of tho negotiations will have
pa--.sel.
Counsellor Polk of the state de-
rartment is expected to appear he
fore the joint cotnmisison early next
week. No session will he held to
morrow, the Mexican commisisoners
oing to New York this afternoon for
the week end.
l'olht Neutral Stril.
The commissioners have consider
ed all of the plans put forward and
the one now favored and which will
be agreed upon in all probability
for submission to the two govern
ments Tor ratification will includo
policing of a neutral strip 40 or Iii)
miles wide in a portion of southern
Fnited States andd northern Mexico,
the police force to be made up of
equal numbers of American and Car
ranzista troop?. The objection to
this scheme encountered from the
Mexican commissioners is that Gen.
Carranza would prefer to choose his
own methods for the suppression of
banditry in Chihuahua.
On this point the American com
missioners are firm, however, and
expect to have their way. They are
not convinced that the Carranza
forces in northern Mexico are suf
ficiently strong to suppress brigand
age. The uppermost thought in their
minds, it was admitted, is that the
withdrawal of Gen. Pershing might
result in an immediate increase of
small bands of raiders who will turn
their attention to American border
town--.
Can't Fix Maine.
The commissioners are still dead
locked in trying to lix responsibility
for the Columbus raid as well as the
Carrial and Parral fights. It is
understood on high authority here
that the situation on these question
has been put up to Mexico City by
the Carranza representative; with
the hope that instructions will be
given to yield the necessary points
to in.-ure an agreement.
Maj. Gen. Tasker H. Pdiss was
again before the commission. He
adis'd acceptance of the phn for
a joint patrol of the international
boundary.

MARKET HAND
OF ILK TRUSTS
Monopolies Established in All
the Large Cities, Accord
ing to Complaints.
International News Service:
WASHINGTON, Sept. lä. The
milk distribution business in most
large cities in the United States is
in the hands of monopolies, accord
ing: to evidence in the hands of in-
estimators of the department of ag
riculture," and the department of jus
tice is planning to join in the nation
wide investigation with a view of
filing anti-trust suits ag-ainst the
milk trusts, it was announced hero
today.
Complaints of milk monopolies
are pouring in to the department of
justice from all parts of the country.
Also it is charged monopolies aro
being established in dairying com
munities in various rural districts
and by freezing out other dealers
attain a situation where they can
constitute the solo market for the
farmers milk which will sour if not
speedily delivered. Once this situa
tion is achieved the buying price
offered the fanner is depressed. The
farmer must sell his milk at the low
price .pay ruinous freight or express
charges to distant markets, or go
out of business. He usually pays
the -trust price."
The two departments of the gov
ernment will cooperate to a large
extent in seeking full information
about the situation in the United
States, and it is expected that fur
ther cooperation is to be sought
from the bureau of the census. This
bureau is planning an economic in
vestigation of the cost of city cart
age. As the department of agricul
ture is especially interested in w hat
effect the cost of maintaining milk
delivery wagons has on the retail
price, the two brunches will work
together on this point.

Vesel Congress With Hold on
Fire Races to Land
and Safety.
International News Service:
MAIISIIFIKLD. Ore., .-ejt. 15.
The jraunt skeleton of the seamer
CongTes .protruding from the sands
off the entrance to Coos bay, was all
that remained today to remind the
25.1 passengers and 170 crew that
had narowly escaped another Yol
turno disaster.
The passengers landet! here were
none the worse for wear today, and
many o: them scattered for their
destinations. They have the speed
of the Congress to thank for their
escnpe, according: to the vessel's of
ficers. With a dangerous fire rarin be
low decks, Capt. Cousins turned the
nose of the Congress toward shore,
"0 miles away, and began a races
with death. Two miles from shore
the fire became so bad that he was
forced to halt and the pasenp:ers and
crew were transferred to the bar
dredge Cajt. Michie, without acci
dent. Other boats, speeding; to his
rescue in response to frantic wire
less calls for help, aided in the work
of rescue.
Highest praise was given the ship's
olficers and crew today by thankful
passengers. Several times during
that thrilling dash for life a panic
was imminent, but the coolness and
caurage of the crew each time avert
ed it.
The Congress and her cargo, own
ed by the Pacific Coast Co., were a
complete loss today. In the vain j
hope of salvaging some of her cargo'
Capt. Ccusins threw her throttle,
wide as he left the steamer, hoping
that she would run on the sands so
they could flood her. The Congress j
was valued at $2.000.000. j
Among the passengers rescued j
was Mrs. Margaret Keig of St. Loui. j
who was ill aboardd. She wa-s carried
from her stateroom on a stretcher!
and safely transferred to the waiting j
barge. She suffered no ill effects j
from her experiences, doctors saidj
today.
