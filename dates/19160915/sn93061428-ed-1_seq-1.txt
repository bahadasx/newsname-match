join with the Doucrats in the light
thi year. ,"
Th Democratic convention did Its
part It la now up to the individual
'voters. The issue is plainly defined
It is battle for clean methods, hon
est service, and decent government
against all that ia corrupt and un
scrupulous in polities; against the
Republican machine and Invisible
Government. It is a fight for New
Mexico, and her people; for the
present and future welfare of the
state and its inhabitants. There must
b no hesitating; no half heartcdnes
no overeonfldence. The repudiated
Republican gang U fighting for its
life thi year; fighting with its bncK
to the wall, desperately, viciously,
-dishonestly, knowing that If defaut-
ed In November its race ia run;
planning If vlctorius to use every
available dollar of state funds, every
state agency and state activity, to
build up an organization that will
tie impregnable against assault for
many years. Every consideration
of good government demands that it
be batcn, decisively, overwhelming
ly. To do thia there must bo or-s-anication
of all forcea In every pre
cinct and every county, to the end
V t't ev-y v"í hr-ll be accounts

that every vot shall be - countod.

THAT BAD ROAD.
To the Peopl of Eddy County.
I want to call your attention to a
few facta, to most of you, who well
knew. But the timo i rips to ap
ply the remedy to an tintolorahlo
condition.
Eddy county proudly possesses
some of th worst roads in the west.
To th present time, no disgrace is
attached to any one. Everyone con
nected with the road work in this
county has done hi hes; with the
very limited funds available.
tical judgment tiache Us tl.at no
community ever ei:ptd the ex pen
slve penalties consequent to a make
Khift and patchwork road policy.
Penalties payable in very ostly
transportation of every community.
Payable in lot time and in th
broken and worn out vehicles of ev.
ery class.
lou who own or drive auto reul
ir.e to the full extent the excessive
coat of upkeop over our roads. But
many do not realize the great saving
in the transportation of produce and
s'ipplies effected by the construction
of smooth and durable roads.
In many localities the construc
tion of such road hs actually doub
led the moving capacity of each team
and driver. In parts of the south
they now haul two bale of cotton to
I he load easier and raster than tney
formerly hauled one.
1 here ar roads tn this state nat
urally a difficult to keep up as any
thing in Eddv County, which were
permanently tuilt under state su,-
pervision, from thre to five years
ago, then tha expense ceased and i
no work! haa been dune on them
sine and little or non i neiJvd to
cay.
T. ature has placed a gateway west
of us. The only pass on any trans
continental line, which will remain
open every day of every winter.
Yet th road across this pais re
mains impassible; and thousands of
tourist dollars In their migrations
westerly and easterly, awing around
us a though this were a plague
spot.
A properly constructed road from
Lovington through lOerlabad to Kl
Paso would divert this- stream of
dollars into ita natural channel.
Because of easier hauling condi
tion much of the mountain trado is
now divwrted to El Puso.
In calling attention to the advan
tage of thl highway, I have Wit
aertised of havlne- an axe to g'lnd.
I have. (But while getting a keen
edge on my axe, hundreds of other
axes will be held to the same stone,
I am willing to do more than my
shar of the turning.
What of the remedy for present
condition. Urdlnarv read revenue
I will not build on mil of road whr
1 r needed.

GRIND JURY REPORTS
Charles Moor Found.
His memory gone, Charles Moore,
the youthful member of a United
States surveying party who dissa
pea red from camp In Grant county
early In Jnly, was found yesterday
st work within a few bicks or nis
horn in Amarilo, Texas,
fine young man, who wa the ob
ject of many long searching exped
ition In the mountain or Middle
Park, was ignorant of the fact that
he was within a short distance of
relatives.
Friends recognized him and took
him home, according to dispatches
received in Denver la it night.
C. W. Moore of llolhrook, Arizona,
the youth' father, who haa been In
Denver for the past two months that
he might aid in the search for hi
lost aon, ia atill in tha city and re
ceived word of his sno's discovery
last night. The youth did not even
know his own name.
Young Moor left the surveyor'
camp near rrazer, July o, saying ne
would return for dinner. Since
that time no clu as to his where
about had been received until lent
night, when his father received the
message If rom hi daughter, Susi
Moor of Amarillo, Texas.
It Is believed that th boy wand
ered away, affected by a temporary
mpa of memory, due to th high al
titud and hard atudy. and $200 wu
offered a a reward for finding Mm.
Arter receiving th tslagram last
night, Mr. Moor said:
"I have heard absolutely no de
tails yet, but have wired my daught
er to tail me everything a soon a
possible. I am convinced, howev
er, that Charlie wandered away in
some kind of a dase, for he is not
the kind of a boy who would stay
away this long without letting ui
know. Either that br (else he
knows something very strange thut
he will tell us of later."
Mr. Moore will wait in Denver un
til the arrival of a letter from his
daughter and then depart for Am
