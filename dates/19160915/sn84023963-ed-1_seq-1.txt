Great Wave of Crime
in "Dry Tennessee
Enforcing Prohibition
Requires Half of
Courts' Time
Chattanooga, Tenn., Dec. 25.
Officials of the various criminal courts
of Tennessee and students of crime
statistics have hecn much concerned
for several months over a large in- t
crease Of infractions against the laws j

the statutes cf Tennessee for seven
years a state-wide prohibition law,
and a number of lesser laws designed
and enacted to aid in the enforcement
of the state-wide law, it was con
fidently expected by the advocates of
prohibition that a maicial reduction
would be noted in crime; but instead
of a reduction there is a steady in
crease in pnu-tbally every grade of
crime, from public drunkenness to
premeditated murder.
That grand juries have been busier
than usual this fall is shown by z
unprecedentedly large number of in
dictments in the more populous cities
and counties. The crfmifial courts are
clogged with business ar:1 jails and
workhouses are fu!l to overflowing. In
some of the counties steps have been
taken to cnlarre t.e facilities of
workhouses in order to cure for the
greater number of criminals con-
victed in the courts of petty crimes

a small offense law.
Published lists of indictments show
beyond doubt that fully fifty per cent,
of the indictments returned by grand
juries throughout the state are for
violations of the prohibition laws and
for public drunkenness. Half of the
time of the criminal courts is taken
. up trying the se cases. Every county
. in the state lias its full quota of boot
leggers and public drunks, to say
nothing of blir.d tiger operators, and
the prosecutions of these offenders
keep criminal courts in perpetual
session. But there ha-.also been an
increase in all other crimes, such as
murder, robbery and larceny.
Hamilton county, of which. Chatta-
Shelby only. The ßand jury for the
fall term of the criminal court of the
county returned more than 700 true
bills, the largest number ever ,-rc-turned
by a single juiy in the history
. of the county. The average number
of true bills returned by a grand
jury in the county during a period of
ten years is about 400. This fall's
record of 700 indictments, therefore,
shows an increase in crime over the
average record of about 75 per cent.
Judge S. D. McReynolds, of the
criminal court, himself a prohibition
ist, admitted that the work of this
' grand jury established a new high
record of crime, and Prosecuting
Attorney IM. N. Whitaker, also a pro
hibitionist, said in an interview that
he could not account for the large
increase, after admitting the facts as
shown by the grand jury's leport. In
the course of his interview Gen Whit
aker took occasion to declare against
constitutional prohibition in view of
the fact that so much dissatisfaction
exists with the prohibitive policy
throughout the state and county that
to place prohibition in a constitution
"would create opposition, if not con
tempt, for the org nie law.
In Davidson and Shelby counties,
Nashville and Memphis being the re
spective capitals, the same growth of
crime is shown. The total number of
indictments returned at Nashville at
the fall term of the criminal courts
approximated 1,200, while the average
of the past years for that county by
a single grand jury is about 700. The
grand juries of Shelby county, where
the average record for one term of the
criminal courts is about S00 indict
ments, have reported approximately
1,500 indictments for the fall term
of court.
The cost of prosecuting offenders
against the so-called temperance laws
of the state has grown to laroe pro
portions. The last biennial reDort of the State
Comptroller shows that it cost the tax
payers of the state 343 ,000 for the
period to prosecute crime, whereas
this item for the last year of a
licensed liquor ü-afhc in the state was
$15S,000. In view of the fact that
there has been a largre increase of
prosecutions in the criminal courts

W1LSON A PROGRESSIVE
BEFORE PARTY WAS BORN
Eighteen months before the
birth of the Progressive Party,
Wooürow Wilson, then Gover
nor of New Jersey, gave this
definition of a Progressive and
so classified himself in an ad
dress before the Kansas Society
of New York, January 29, 1911 :
"By 'Radical' I understand
one who goes too far; by
'Conservative' one who does
not go far enough; by 'Re
actionary' one who won't

,,eiT3eva Progressive, which I
take to be one who insists
on recognizing new facts,
adjusting policies to facts
and circumstances as they
arise.1'
Under Democratic influences
during the six-year period since
standpatism was overthrown in
the House of Representatives in
1910, ninety per cent of the pro
gram of reform advocated by
the Progressive Party has been
enacted into law. "Invisible
government," which is now mak
ing desperate efforts to "come
back," has been driven from
power under President Wilson's
administration and will have no
place in Washington so long as
lie is in the White House.

A NARROW ESCAPE.
rtrtenco of Mind In the Face
of a
Terrible Danger.
One of the strangest incidents of
the sepoy rebellion iß told by Wil
liam Forbes Mitchell in his "Eem
iniscences of the Great Mutiny'
Mr. Mitchell, who was sergeant of a
highland regiment, had the misfor
tune during a battle to lose the
greatcoat which every soldier car
ried folded in what was known as
a "Crimean roll" and strapped to
the shoulders in such a manner that
it crossed the breast;
Many a man owed hiB life to the

My company was encamped in
and about the tomb of tho first king
of Oudh. A large inclosure Bur
rounded the building of the tomb
itself, and on the inside of this
were small rooms built for the ac
commodation of pilgrims. When I
entered the inclosure I noticed
these apartments and asked permis
sion to sleep in one of them, but
was refused. I had to make the
best of my position, but was too un
comfortable to sleep.
It struck me that some of the se

With this h?pe I " went info - one of

"To this end I have been preaching

"The production of the sugar beet

WITCHCRAFT IN ENGLAND,
Til Last of the Judicial Prosvcutioni

Sir Matthew Hale, it is true, had
hanged two poor women at Cam
bridge in but a few years later
Lord Chief Justice Holt set him
self strongly against Isnch charges

directed the jury to bring in a ver
dict of rtcquittal. In a celebrated
trial at "Guildford in 1701 not only
waa the supposed witch found not
guilty, but her false accuser, one
John Hathaway, was condemned to
a year's imprisonment and to stand
in the pillory three times. Yet,
horrible to relate, a woman named
Hicks and her daughter, a child of
nine,, were hanged together at
Huntingdon on July 28, 1716, for
raising a ßtorm of wind m league
with the defil.
The last judicial sentence for
witchcraft in England was in 1736,
one Jane Wenham being actually
found guilty, according to the in
dictment, of "conversing familiar
ly with the devil in the form of a
cat." The judge, however, procured
a reprieve for poor old Jane, nnd
she was ultimately released, to end
her days in peace.
Iast, the witchcraft act was re
pealed for the United Kingdom iL
the same year. ;

a woman was brought before Cap
tain David Ross, deputy sheriff of
Sutherland, charged with "causinp
her daughter to be shod by the dev

hands and feet. The fact having
been proved to the captain'i satis
faction, the old woman was put into
a tar barrel and burned at Dornoch.
