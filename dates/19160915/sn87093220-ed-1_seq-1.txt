BIG CROWDS AT
COUNTY FAIR
10,000 People Were Present
at the Public Weddicj
Sunday Afternoon
MOVIES WILL SHOW FAIR
Fair Association Breaks With
American Trotting Associa
tion-Now in Outlaw Class
Suhday marked the closing of the
Grays Harbor County Fair at Elma,
which from every angle was the most
successful agricultural and mechanical
exhibit ever staged in the county. It
is estimated that 30,000 people visit
ed the grounds during the five days
the fair was in progress. Sunday, as
advertised, was the record day, when
no less than 10,000 visitors passed
through the gates. There is no doubt
hat the fair this year has been a finan
cial success, although the managers
report will not be ready for the public
for several days.
The mystery surrounding the identi
ty of the couple who were married
publicly on the fair grounds, was lift
ed at 2 o'clock Sunday" afternoon,
when the contracting parties were
driven into the arena in the tour
ing car of Councilman John D. Walker
of Aberdeen, and Oscar Hermans, sec
retary of the Aberdeen Moose lodge,
nd secretary of the local Scandinavian
club, and Miss Ellen Johnson, also of
Aberdeen, took their places before
Justice of the Peace Murphy of Monte
sano to be pronounced man and wife.
The bride and groom are numbered
among the most popular young folks in
Aberdeen, and the ovation tendered
them at their appearance before Judge
Murphy was of such a hearty nature
that it will linger long in the memo
ries of the happy couple.
Congressman Albert Johnson gave
the bride away with a few well chosen
remarks. Miss Nina Olson of Aber
deen was bridesmaid, and J. H. Riggs
and W. H. Tucker were righthand men
to the groom. The groom made a
mistake, however, in kissing his wife
at the conclusion of the ceremony in
that he established a precedent of
yhich Congressman Johnson and Judge
Murphy took advantage of and dupli
cated the performance.
Later in the day Mr. and Mrs. Her
mans were guests of honor at a din
ner given by J. J. Anderson, at the
Imperial hotel. In the evening they
left for the Sound and Britisli Colum
bia cities for a brief honeymoon.
Gifts valued at $725, including a
nice building lot in this city, were pre
sented Mr. and Mrs. Hermans imme
diately following the ceremony.
The gifts range from small articles
of merchandise contributed bjt mer
chants all over the county, to quan
tities of lumber and shingles—enough
for a bungalow—from mill men on the
Harbor. No doubt the bride will find
it an interesting occasion when she at
tempts to store all her presents under
her own i'oof.
The most important result develop
ed from the fair, is the fact that the
Pathe Weekly News sent a man here
from Seattle to photograph the im
portant events of the fair, including
the public wedding, and these will be
incorporated as an item in an early
release of national and international
events. In other words the Grays Har
bor County fair will be shown on thou
sands of screens in both this coun
try and Europe.

THE COUNTERSIGN IS "PATRIOTISM."
CITY SCHOOLS
STILL GROWING
Increase of 220 Over Second Week of
Last Year —Many Come From
Outside Point*.
Evidently enrollment at the city
schools of Aberdeen has not yet reach
ed its limit, and probably will not for
several weeks. On Monday morning
38 new pupils appeared at the various
schools about the city making a total
now of 1.P95. The first of next week
is expected to see this number in
creased beyond the 2,000 mark.
Most of the new students are from
outside points, all parts of the county
contributing. Elma and McCleary are
represented by a number of pupils. In
some cases entire families have moved
here for the express purpose of af
fording the children the advantages
of city schools.
No tuition is charged outside stu
dents. The schools are open to any
one who cares to enter, from within
or outside the county.
Aberdeen's high school lias every fa
cility usually found in the high schools
of much larger cities, and the en
rollment this year now totals 336, an
increase of 54 over the same period of
last year. Most of the pupils from out
side points are found in the high
school.
REDMOND SLOUGH
CLAIMS VICTIM
Wallace Mason, Seven-Year-Old Boy
Drowned Near Melbourne Saturday
While Bathing. Falls
From Log.
Disregarding instructions of his old
er brother, Leo, not to go swimming,
little Wallace Mason, 7-year-old son of
Mr. and Mrs. Clyde Mason, who live
near Melbourne, was drowned Satur
day morning in Redmond slough, while
bathing with several other boys. "*
The lad, after undressing, climbed
onto some logs projecting out from
the bank, into deep water, and slip
ped from the far end of one of them,
pulling one companion with him. The
latter managed to get back on the
log, but the Mason boy failed to appear
after going beneath the surface. Leo,
the older brother, who was out in the
field, responded to the cries of the
other boys on the bank of the slough
and made an unsuccessful effort to
save his brother.
Several hours of dragging were nec
essary before the body was found. The
funeral was held at Montesano Tues
day, where the Mason family formerly
lived.
The Herald tells it all.
best and most important of the week,
and many noted horses were on the
track. As is usual with race horses,
favorites fell behind, and unknown ani
mals carried off many of the honors,
causing much excitement. The lead
ing event of the races, with the with
drawal of the Fair association from the
American Trotting association, follow
ing the refusal of the local association
to withhold 25 per cent of the earn
ings of the winners on telegraphic in
structions from headquarters of the
former at Chicago, claiming the own
ers of horses were in arrears with the
American association. This action
forces the Grays Harbor County Fair
in the outlaw class.
Lack of space precludes the Herald
from publishing the hundreds of win
ners for various exhibits, but those
who have attended the local fair year
after year since its inception, are
unanimous that the one just closed, for
a county situated as Grays Harbor is,
has never been equalled in the state.

CITY COUNCIL
LET CONTRACTS
Standard Transfer Co. to Pave
West Boulevard—Keasel &
Co. to Repair B St. Slide
BIDS OPENED FOR TRUCK
Members of Council Will Make
Tour of the Wishkah Water
Works—Will Go in Relays
At the meeting of the city council,
Wednesday evening, two bids were
opened for the improvement of West
bouldevard. The Standard Transfer
company was found to be lowest bid
der and was awarded the ctpitract. The
Independent Sand and Gravel company
was the other bidder.
Carl Gylling was warded the contract

pany were awarded the contract. Other
bidders were Ben Finsted and Carl
Gylling.
Eingineer Kelsey reported that the
bid submitted last week by the Inde
pendent Sand and Gravel company, and
which had been laid over for a week,
was well within his estimate for the
Improvement of Evans street, and
recommended thait 'the contract be
awarded the bidder. The council or
dered the awarding of the contract.
Protests were filed against the im
provement of the alley in Block 9,
Weatherax and Ben addition, between
First and Second streets, and the
improvement will not be made at thts
time.
A resolution was passed for the im
provement of Lafayette street and
Pioneer boulevard.
Five bids were summited for the
truck the city proposes to purchase
for the water department; Kissel for
11,385, by N. W. Kauntz of Ho
quiam; Mack truCjk, for $2,100 by
Cook and Easter, city; Maxwell, $585,

tires, $1,200, and Packard, solid tires,
$2,075, M. M. Stewart. The bids were
turned over to the water committee
for one week.
Councilman J. D. Walker asked for
a leave of absence for two weeks,
which was granted.
On suggestion of Mayor Phillips,
members of the council decided to
take a day off and go over the route
of the Wiskah water project in order
to familiarize themselves with the
work under way. To meet the con
venience of all the members, the trip
will be made on three different days,
next Saturday, Sunday and Monday,
as it was found impossible for all the
council men to get off the same day.
WILL TRY TO DISPOSE
OF COUNTY HOSPITAL
If 110 protests are tiled against the
sale of the county hospital—Grays
Harbor's white elephant—next Monday
before the county commissioners, the
building will be advertised and sold
as quickly as it can be legally done.
No protests are expected, as the tax
payers are entirely willing that the
incubus should be disposed of. Aber
deen physicians are planning to sub
mit a bid, and If successful, will con
vert the useless and expensive struc
ture into a modern hospital.

The primary elections Tuesday re
sulted in the nomination of Senator
Poindexter to succeed himself by a
majority over Humphreys of about 10,-
000. Henry Mcßride won the free for
all race for gubernatorial honors and
will contest with Gov. Lister In the
Novermber finals. Congressman John
son won over Fawcett in a walk, and
will thresh it out with Geo. Fish
bourne, democratic, Nov. 7.
Despite the efforts of the State
Democratic organization, the vote in
the county shows that democrats
generally participated in the Repu
blican primaries. This is due large
ly to the fact that there were no til
ings for county offices by democrats,
which left the voters of that party
open game for the army of aspirants
on the Republican ticket, so that the
blame, if blame there be is at least
divided between the parties. Some
democrats voted in the opposition
primaries as a protest against the
provision of the law which compels
separate ballots for local officials,
and with them this practice will not
cease until a ballot is provided con
taining all candidates the same as
those at the general election.
The county contests resulted in the
nomination of Quinn for sheriff by a
plurality pf 270, over Searles, his ohly
competitor who was seriously in the
race. Orton won the nomination for
county treasurer over R. A. Wiley by
344 votes, after the most extensive and
expensive campaign of anyone on the
republican ballot. T. W. Bibb de
feated N. D. McKillip for school sup
erintendent by 324 votes, while W. H.
Tucker trotted off with the nomination
for county attorney with the plurality
of 682. BJbb and Tucker received the
highest- votes in Aberdeen, the former
getting 1,619 to 880 for McKillip, a
result that is being accounted for by
an alleged attempt of McKillip to be
smirch the character of Bibb toward
the close of the campaign.
