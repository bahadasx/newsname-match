FRENCH MAINTAIN
POSITIONS TAKEN
NORTH OF PERRONE
Vienna and Berlin Report Attacks in
Carpathians Have Been Repulsed
Aeroplanes Active in Gulf
of Riga
London, Sept. 12. The French
north of Perrone hold tenaciously to
the salient they have driven into the
German lines east of the Bethune road,
They hold intact, too, Bouchavnes and
other points along the line captured in
the offensive started Tuesday. Their
capture of a powerfu'ly organized
German trench system south of the
Le Priez farm near the road running
west from Rancourt to Combles has
further jeopardized Combles.
Finding that the French had cut
their line of communication from Per
rone northward the Germans threw
violent attacks against L'Abbe wood
end Hill 76 and retook both places.
The French, however, returned to the
attack and, after hard fighting, final
ly drove out the Germans and kept
the ground they won.
Heavy fighting continues all along
the Macedonian front, but no import
ant changes are reported. The Ital
, ians have joined in the fray west of
the Varda river.
In the Dobrudja region of Rumania
the Central powers are going on with
their operations methodically, accord
. ing to Berlin.
In the Carpathians Russian attacks
along the entire front have been re
pulsed, according to Vienna and Ber
lin. Petrograd says the Russians are
holding all the, ground they have won
in this region .
German aeroplanes sank a Russian
torpedo boat destroyer in the Gulf of
Riga and attacked Russian naval forc
es in the Black sea off Constanza, Ru
mania. Besides the destroyer sunk,
several other hits were observed in
both the attacks, Berlin says.

Christiania, Norway, Pept . 13 . A
new type of ship has arrived here from
the shipyards of Christianiafjord. The
ship, which resembles a huge barge, is
constructed entirely of concrete, ex
cept for ribs of steel. It is said the
hull will resist damage better than
y steel or wood, and is therefore .safer.

Suggestions as to what methods shall
be employed to establish peace on the
Mexican border were submitted today
to General Trasker H. piiss, U. S.
A., by the American members of the
American-Mexican joint commission.
The officer's opinions wer sought
on subjects ranging from the withr

A PROGRESSIVE'S VIEW
In declaring unequivocally for the
re-election of President Wilson, Judge
Charles R. Spence, one of the leading
Progressives of the State, says:
"The nomination of Mr. Hughes by
1he Republicans cannot serve to mask
the batteries that are behind him.
I They are still manned by the 'old
guard' and the munitions are still
supplied by the great favor-seeking
corporations, which have not been
neutral in recent years when the Re
publican party has been in peril. The
rj"!sonnel and directing forces of the
recent Chicago convention demon
strates this to every unprejudiced ob
server.
."-"The character of the organization
is precisely the same now as it was in
1912. If those who then joined the
Progressive movement were justified
in; their revolt, they are all the more

justified now in preventing the return
