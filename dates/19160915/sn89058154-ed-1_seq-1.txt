SELMER. McNAIRY COUNTY, TENN..! FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 15, IQI6.
NUMBER II
The way the Augusta (Ga.)
Chronicle, The Newport (Va.)
s News, The Jacksonville CFla.)
Times Union, The Greensboro
(N. C.) News, .The Charlotte (N.
) C.) News, the Greenville (S. C).
News and other SQuthern demo
cratic papers shoot the Adamson
law is terrific. . Congress never
passed a law so unpopular and
especially, in the South; (The
principle it establishes gives to
Congress the right to ;fix the
wages of the most humble cotton
chopper in the South. It only
takes a combine and a dire threat
to do dire harm to the country,
to meet what Congress consid
ered sufficient reason to act in
the future as they did in this in
stance, . provided a president
holds a tig stick over them.
It is strange though true, that
there are men who will beg and
get credit from a merchant, and
when asked to pay, fail to do po.
Then they cease to trade at that
store and if they have a dime to
spend go to a merchant who
would not credit them. - But
worse than all, they will knock
on the first merchant, and say
his goods are no good, and his
v prices are higher than they should
be. Are you such a man? ' If so,
you would feel more like a gen
tleman if you would either pay
what you owe or tell the mer
chant you cannot but will, and
continue to trade with him as
long as he can credit you.
Maine Election
Monday the voters of Maine
registered their will. Much in
terest and a fine day contributed
to the largest vote ever cast in
the state.
The state had been cultivated
by many of the greatest speak
ers of the day.' For two weeks
most of Wilson's cabinet ' with
Speaker Clarke and a host of
senators had spoken in every
hamlet. The republicans had
followed suit and closed out with
Hughes Friday and Saturday.
Roosevelt made several speeches.
The national issues were fully
discussed and it , was considered
a pointer on the tariff and strike
legislation and the present ad
ministration. The democrats
. claimed the state by 3,000; the
republicans by 15,000. ' It went
' by about 13,800 for the republi
cans, electing a governor over
the present democrat, two U. S.
senators, and four congressmen,
thus changing the senate and
house by one each. The legisla
ture is largely republican.
Maine was a strong Roosevelt
state, but they all came into line,
which insures the united party
elsewhere, and such being the
case, we see but little induce
ment for us to contribute any
great amount the Commercial
Appeal's campaign fund. ,
West Tenn. Farmers' Convention
- The annual meet of the Farmers'
Institute was at Jackson last week.
There is an institute in each of the
three divisions of the state, and all
under the management of the State
Agricultural College at Knoxville.
The meeting waa held at the Expert
ment Station one mile from Jackson.
The beautiful auditorium built two
years ago is used for all "day meet
lugs. It is a permanent - structure,
with a capacity of over 3,000 seats.
This building was erected at a cost
of $8,000 and by the individual deler
gaUs attending the convention. It
is expected that each delegate hav
ing free transportation will contrib
ute $1.00 each year and thereby , pay
for tha building. There is a balance
of $3,S0O.due, with about $1,000
paid at last meeting. A good many
do not pay, but a record is made of
all who do, and they alone are recog.
nized as members of the Institute.
The crops on the farm all. show up
nicely. The crop of alfalfa was the
one most talked about by visitors.
They are giving it a test out under all
conditions. ,
I The silago Is made, of corn and
sorghum grown together very thickly
jn the row and cut by harvester and
the two large silos filled. "They fat
ten quite a lot of cattle - outside ' of
the dairying stock they keep.
They have a number of Percheron
mares with fine colts by their side
These mares do must of the farm
work, as well as raise the colts.
The usual lectures and demonstra
tions were had and routine necessary,
to put the Institute on a business
basis. - :''
Dr. McRea, of Union City, was re
elected president. The term is fixed
at not over two years as president.
Mr. Nichols was elected secretary.
lie is the manager of the farm.
We were forcefully struck by the
number of ladies present. In fact,
olmo'st if not quite "one half the crowd
were women and girls, and they have
their organization in full blast cover
ing the interests of the women as
farmers' wives and daughters.- Our
county was well represented ' and
much interested. It was estimated
2,000 were in attendance. Neither
on the grounds nor in Jackson during
two days we never heard an oath noj
saw a man under the influence .of
liquor. 1 . ,
Sipes for the Senate
We understand that Hon. J. P.
Sipes, for three terms member of the
legislature, has an eye on the senate
from this district. That Sipes has
proved to be a faithful and safe mem
ber of the lower house is well known.
He has been true as steel on all leg
islation looking to , the morals and
good of the state. His vote at last
election" p,f . 560 majority over the
chairman of the county court, shows
that he gets votes outside hia party.
We do not personally know Mr.
Stockard, the democratic nominee,
but understand he is one ' of the old
line regulars, wearing the yoke of
the bosses that be. Mr. Sipes can
get the solid republican vote and fiv
hundred in the district who vote for
men and measures rather than a
political label. - The convention to se
lect a candidate has not "been called,
but should be arid at Saimer, as.it has
been some time since she has been
honored with a senatorial convention.

itary events, and - music something

ten: : v - .

Exposition. Ask your station agent
about the low rates.
Selmer People Get Instant Action
Those who have used it in Selmer
are astonished at the Instant action
of simple buckthorn bark, glycerine,
etc., as mixed in Adler-i-ka. Because
it acts on Both lower and upper bowel.
One Spoonful Adler-i-ka relieves al
most Any Case constiDation, sour
stomach or gas. It removes such
surprising foul matter that a few
doses often relieve or prevent appen
dicitis. A sliort treatment -helps
chronic stomach trouble. Browder

of Christ and prepare to meet their

before them, where there will be no
more heartaches and partings of
loved ones, and we all may meet as
brothers protected by the moat ex

Duck Snout
Tells how to Choose Your Friends
In choosing friends, bear tbia in mind:
a Look out for them that's over-kind
' And sweet as honey at the 'start; v
The quickest met will soonest part, -While
them that's slower in their ways
. May be yer friends fer many days, ,
Ted Waffles, down there by the creek,
Haa been there jest about a week '
And be was slobberin over me,
'; As sweet and flatterin as could be, - '
Jest like he'd knowed me all his life;
: .'A Said be was cousin to my wife,
I missed a shote or two, and then
A turkey and a guinea-hen;
I sorter hinted this to Ted;
' He kindo walled his eyes and said:
"You gotta watch' them niggers, Buck,
Or they will tote off all your truck."
Next thing I knowed, the triflin booger,
Instid of coatin me witb sugar,
Was tellin round behind my back
How he had shorely seed MY track
A-leadin to his corn-crib door!
Since then he's honeyed me no more.
x Bilr Younger lived by me a year
Bef ore he ever once come near,
But when our baby lay so low
He'd visit every day or so, '
And come and set up every night
'. Until the baby was all right.
Tode Willis (look out for ole Tode!)
Had tole me everything he knowed
"r . The very first day that I met im
And loaned me everything I'd let ira.
One week was nothin but invitin;
We went; next week we was a-fightin.
Look out fer them that's quick acquainted:
They're like a pole that's newly painted:
, They gaum yer hands, their color's played:
The earliest blossoms soonest fade.
Bill Younger is the sort that stioks;
Me and others never mix.
