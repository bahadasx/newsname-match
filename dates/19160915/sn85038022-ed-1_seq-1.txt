cession of persons who wish to be
heard. It was thought advisable that
(leneral llliss should explain In per-
son to the Mexican commissioners the
Hilary aspec t of h.irder plans as seen
hy I niled States Army olliclala.
No definite plan for border patrol
has taken shape in the minds of th.
commissioners. The Americans con
ferred with Ceneral Bliss again to
day. It was Indicated that the pro
posal which has appealed most strong
ly to them was that a border con
stabulary be created to operate as u
policy force along both sides of the
line. 11 was suggested that the force
be composed of former soldiers of
both countries, under joint control
ami that the expense be shared by
both governments.
Detail Worked Out
Details of the plans have not been
worked out in its favor it is argued
that the Mexican people would not feel
toward, the constahularly the game
hostility that they displayed toward
the American trops which have cross
ed tlie line. It was also suggested
that the police force would be far
more effective In clearing the moun
tains of Northern Mexico of bandits
than either Mexican or American
troops.
The joint commission probably will
adjourn tomorrow over the week-end
to permit the .Mexican members to
celebrate the Mexican Independence
Day, September Hi. In a statement
issued tonight the following summary
of today's proceedings was given:
"The session was devoted to an in
formal interchange of views on the
enforcement of law In Mexico and the
guarantee to personal property rights
The Mexican commissioners presented
a char statement of the purpose ol
the furruuza government with refer
ence to the reform of the civil code
and the code of procedure. They ex
plained that under the Diaz regime
tttcBu judicial procedures were M
cumbersome and expensive and the
judiciary so corrupt, that it was Im
possible for a poor man to obturi jus
tice "

STOCKINGS THAT WEAR!
No one puts a stocking more to test than does a growing child. He likes to get
down on his knees and play marbles, he is continually falling and trying his best to
wear out his stockings, but he meets a difficult task when he strikes a BLACK CAT hose.
These stockings will stand out under the strain longer than all others. If you do not
believe it, try a pair. THEY SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES.
