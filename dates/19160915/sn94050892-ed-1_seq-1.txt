sured of his renomination, by a large
majority .issued the following state
ment: To the People of Arizona:
As the incoming returns indicate,
quite conclusively, that my renomi
nation for the Governorship is certain,
I hasten to express to the Arizona
public my profound appreciation of
the support so freely given to my can
didacy. While I would not be hu
man if I did not experience on this
occasion the utmost satisfaction at
my renomination, I realize quite fully
that the greatest victory consists in
the electorate's vindication of repre
sentative government, as embraced by
the State's Constitution and the
record of constructive public effort
which is based upon its fundamental
principles'. Surely it has been
demonstrated, beyond a doubt, thai
the people of Arizona will not readily
submit to the yoke of organized
greed. While the campaign before
the Primaries was marked by bitte
attacks upon those rights and princi
ples which Arizona's people hold
most, dear, I personally harbor no re
sentment against those Democratic
voters who, for reasons which they
doubtless deemed worthy, opposd me
In my race for renomination. It is
my earnest hope that all such Demo
crats will accept the result of the
Primary Election in a spirit of gen
erosity and fair play,' turning their
efforts henceforth to the winning of a
great victory for Arizona's Demo
cracy In November.
Gratefully and sincerely,
GEO. W. P. HUNT

that he is a good loser:
"I think the democrats of Arizona
have again made Gov. Hunt their
candidate for re-election. This I con
cede and in doing so desire to thank
my friends throughout the state for
their loyal support. I am proud of
the efforts put forth In my behalf by
old friends whom I have known so
long. For those who have opposed
my nomination by .fair means I have ;
no political ill will and now that the
primary .fight is over, I desire to see!
a reunited democracy in Arizona, i
There is something more to the j
democratic party than the ambitions I
of any man and I hope the party
strength will not be weakened as a re
sult of my candidacy."
The County Contest.
The Hunt and Olney forces had
been lined up in Greenlee county in
formidable array and the fight was
waged relentlessly on both sides
with the result that Hunt came out
a winner here by the small majority
of 186 in the. county, his total being
1016, while Olney received 870. The
union vote went almost solidly for
Hunt and to this can be attributed his
majority .
The hardest tight in the county
outside of that between Olney and
Hunt was that between Slaughter and
Cash for the office of Sheriff. The
contest was bitterly waged from the
start and towards the end of the cam
paign both factions were doing their
utmost to land their candidate, al
though as predicted beforehand, the
outcome was close. Slaughter receiv
ed a total of 1118 and Cash 1045, giv
ing Slaughter a majority of 73 in the
county. Morenci, Cash's home town,
gave Slaughter a majority of 47,
while in return Clifton, Slaughter's
home town, gave Cash a majority of
61.
For State Senator Whipple won over
Aker by a majority of 201.
Coffee and McGrath, for members
of the House of Representatives,

were nominated by the respective

There were three candidates for the
office of Treasurer, Pickens Anderson

TOWN TAKEN UP
BY COUNCIL
The Question of Improvements lfof
the Town of Clifton is Again Be
fore the Council at their - Meeting
Last Night '
Morenci is suffering from a small
pox epidemic the magnitude of which
far overshadows that which visited
Clifton some two years ago. Every
effort is being exerted by the county
health officer. Dr. L. A. W. Burtch,
and Morenci physicians to check the
disease and prevent its spread over a
larger territory. At the present
time it is reported that there are pa
tients in the pest house at Bunkers,
and nearly every day one or two new
cases are developed.
As a result of the epidemic the
Morenci Public schools have been or
dered closed as well as the Morenci
Club, moving picture shows and all
public places of amusement, the only
business being kept open are the com
pany stores.
It is thought that the epidemic was
introduced into ouf sister town by
Mexicans who have recently arrived
from across the border, and unless a
change for the better is evident and
the spread of the disease can be ef
fectually checked it is more than
probable that Morenci will be placed
under a strict quarantine.
A large new pest house is . being
erected some distance below . Bunk
ers to care for the patients and the
work is being rushed to completion
in order to take care of the many
cases. . t w ; - ; . . :

EDITOR BECOMES BENEDICT
The following item will be of inter
est to many Clifton people, as Mr.
Douglas was in the district for several
weeks during the late -strike,- covering
the situation for a string of southwest
ern papers:
"Just to show what a newspaper
man can do when he tries, Ernest
Douglas, editor and business manager
of the Jerome News, went down to
Phoenix last Friday and got married
Saturday.
"The victim of "Doug's" machina
tions was Miss Nettie Dodt, a young
woman never before known to exhibit
anything but the utmost good sense
and reason. But, as Shakespeare said,
"Girls marry most anybody."
"If the society editor of the News
were not away on her vacation she
would write that Mrs. Douglas is one
of the sweetest and most charming
brides seen in Jerome since the U. V.
was discovered. As it is, Mrs. Doug
las will have to be content with the
adjectives bestowed upon her by the
papers in Phoenix, where she is very
well known and was popular before
she married a Jerome newspaperman.
"After a quiet wedding, attended
only by immediate relatives, Mr. and
Mrs. Douglas went to Prescott, where
they enjoyed a brief honeymoon.
They arrived in Jerome Tuesday
evening, laden with wedding presents
that they had accumulated along the
way. Here they found another car
load of silverware, mining stock and
other presents contributed by friends
scattered from Cincinnati, the for
mer home of the bride, to Jerome.
"Mr. and Mrs. Douglas have pur
chased the A. D. Hayes house on the
hogback, where they will be at home
shortly to their friends." Jerome
news.
TORPEDO EXPLODES '
PRESCOTT Little Vivian Raaf, the
six-year-old daughter of Rev. and
Mrs. Raaf, was the victim of a pe
culiar accident, when a paper torpedo
used in celebrations, exploded in her
mouth, from which she suffered se
verely for several days . The child was
unaware of the danger, and at the
time had the explosive between her
teeth, while playing with other child
ren. In biting the paper with her
teeth, the compound exploded with
such force as to throw the child to the
floor, it was reported. Her injuries,
however, are only superficial.
E. L. Gav. manager of the A. C . Connie Thompson, of Morenci,
store at Metcalf, was a county seat has been spending the week in Clif
Imsiness visitor on Wednesday ton with friends.
JEROME VERDE SHAFT
ENLARGED DOWN TO 460
At a meeting of the Town
Council last night at the City Hall
the discussion of town improvements
occupied the greater part of the
body's deliberations.' The question
has been taken up at different timet
but with no definite result on account
of the lack of finances for the various
propositions! The town engineer Is
now at work on preliminary surveys
and estimates, and although no fig
ures are obtainable at this time as
to the cost, it is thought that the to
tal expenditures for the projected im
Drovementa will reach the sum of noa
sibly $500,000. -The improvements
are all badly needed and the money,
would be wisely, expended in this, direction.
The question of bridges was one of
the first to be brought before the
meeting. It was voted to build the
South Clifton bridge to connect with
Railroad Avenue, which would place
it a short distance below the present
railroad bridge.
A .representative of a chemical fire
engine was present at the meeting
and submitted' figures on fire appar
atus for the town. It was decided
however, to include the matter of firs
equipment in the general improve
ments owing to the shortage of fi
nances.
The matter of taking the improve
ments up in whole or in part was dis
cussed with the result that the con
census of opinion of the members
W9 that no tha -nrnnnntHnn tit a a
huge undertaking, -they would ; take
them up a part at a time.
The improvements - decided ' upon
and which - will probably be carried
out as soon as the surveys and esti
mates are completed Include two
bridges, city hall, sidewalks, removal
of old buildings on East Side of river,
street grading, fire equipment, rais
ing the Hill's Addition retaining wall,
construction of fire hail, purchasing
lot and drainage on Chase Creek
and also purchasing land on Hill's
Addition for street purposes.
The above improvements will ' be
taken up first by the Council and the
matter of a water works and sewer
age system will be considered later,
as the expenditure on the above items
alone will amount to considerable.
It is thought probable that the .
rnwn will DVAnhlfllllr Ya hnnHn in aft
amount sufficient to cover the entire
cost of improvements. To complete
all the improvements contemplated at
this time would take several years
work and it was thought best by the
council to take up the items one at a
time and work to the end gradually.
JEROME, Sept. 12 Delays are a
thing of the past at the Jerome Verde.
The work of enlarging the shaft from
one to three compartments is proceed
ing rapidly.
Today the shaft has been enlarged
down to 460 feet. The water is only
ten or fifteen feet below the miners
The pumps are lowering it as fast
as necessary. The ground is a little
heavier than it was above.
KILL MOUNTAIN LIONS
PRESCOTT: G. H. Miller and
Ramsey Patterson have made another
cleanup of mountain lions in Thomp
son valley, killing three on Monday,
which makes five in the past month.
In the latest mixup they report close
escapes in being attacked, the female
lion fiehtiner desperately to the last.
