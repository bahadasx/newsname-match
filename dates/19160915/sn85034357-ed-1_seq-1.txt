- !
Democratic Candidate For Con?
gress in Ninth District, is j
Given Royal Reception?A j
Great Speech to a Large |
and Intelligent Crowd.
Hon. E. Lee Trinkle, Domocratie
candidate- for congress from tile Ninth
District, addressed one of the larg?
est audiences here Tuesday that has
assembled in the Court House- to hoar
a political address for a number of
years. The house was tilled to its
fullest capacity ar.d the hallways were
filled with men who were unable to gev
into the auditorium.
A large number of the ladies of the
town and county were present and
graced the occasion.
Hon. Georg? C. Pecry, of this city,
introduced the speaker. In his in?
troductory remarks, Mr. Peery briefly
outlined the many accomplishments of
the Democratic administration He
expressed the opinion that the people
of the Ninth district will, hi view of
the President's efforts for pence, and
his settlement of the railroad strike,
and other patriotic efforts of the Pres?
ident, rise uj> and give Wilson a sup
.porter in the halls of Congress by the
election of E. Lee Trinkle in Novem?
ber. Many of the leading citizens of
this town, who have heard the dis?
tinguished speakers of the Nation,
were positive in their statements that
the speech of Mr. Trinkle was the big?
gest thing of the kind delivered in
Tazewell for many years. The Demo?
crats who heard the address were
doubly strengthened in the faith and
many of the Republicans in the au?
dience were put to thinking. One in
particular, greeted the speaker at the
close of his address, and pledged him
his support, after voting the Repub?
lican ticket for the past half century.
Another in conference with the writer
of report, stated that he had been a
close friend of Slemp for many years ,
und was n friend of the senior Slemp,
but that after hearing the speech of
Mr. Trinkle he had decided that his ,
friendship had continued Ion genough
and that in view of the record of Mr.
Slemp in opposing the many great re?
forms advocated by President Wilson |
he would have to part company with 1
the Republican party in this canvass ,
and vote with the Democrats. It is
believed that many ether Republicans j
in this county will do likewise, but ,
will not make a public expression of ,
the fact for fear of being "set upon" ]
by the Republican workers.
Mr. Trinkle, in his address, evoked i
a great deal of laughter by his ref?
erence to T. J. Munsey as "Soup i
- House Tom.," the famous Ninth dis?
trict Republican orator, who became >
famous by his predictions that in the 1
event of the election of Wilson "cob- i
webs would grow over the drift- ?
mouths of ;very coal mine in this sec- i
tion; that the farmers would get 15c :
for their wool, 5c for their cattle and
$10 for their bull calves," etc. i
Mr. Trinkle declared frequently that
his enndidncy was not a personal 1
mntter with him and that he did not
ask votes for his own election alone, 1
but that he was asking the voters of 1
Southwest Virginia, who are his 1
neighbors and friends, to do what is 1
best for them, lie read letters con- '
corning his challenge to Slemp to 1
meet him in joint debate throughout
the district and replies from Slemp ;
declining the challenge. Speaking of I
the situntion Mr. Trinkle said: '"When
I have been to Congress as long ns
C. Bnscom -Slemp and some mountain .
boy invites me to meet him in joint .
debate I will meet him if he skins me
alive." He read a letter from one of ?
the leading statesmen of the country
in which he said, in speaking of the
record of Mr. Slemp in congress: "So .
far as I am able to determine, C. !
Bascom Slemp has no record. The on?
ly thing of note he has done was ,
to vote ugainst the Federal reserve j
bill,, which is characterized as the
greatest piece of legislation ever put
on the statute books. The day is past
to follow mere party empty emblems (
unless they stand for something. I
want every man who votes to know
what ho is voting for."
He recalled the prophecies by
Slemp and Tom Munsoy in regard to
$10 bull calves, 15c wool, etc., and
stated that if the bats arc now mak?
ing their habitats and dwelling plac?
es in the coke ovens of Southwest
Virginia, as they writhe and wait in
anguish they are vitrifying Slemp
and Munsey who deceived them into
going there."
In an eloquent peroration on peace,
be moved bis large nudience to tears.
He referred to the boys that had been
sent to Mexico and of the grief that
their departure spread throughout
the country, but pictured the inex?
pressible suffering and sorrow that
would hr.ve prevailed if war had ta?
ken place. He told how the poor
Mexicnn peons, oppressed and down?
trodden, were rescued bv Wilson,
without the expenditure of millions of
the people's money and without the
shedding of the blood of her citizens.
In referring to the controversy with
Germany in which the latter power
bad declared that Americans must not
travel on the high seas except at their
own risk, he told how Mr. Slemp had
voted ngainst the legislation which
Mr. Wilson had nroposcd to save the
situntion, and then wondered that the
voters of the ninth district could or
would countenance a representative
that had voted "in favor of the em?
peror of Germany and against Presi?
dent Wilson.
After the speaking, Mr. Trinkle, in
compnr with Geo. C. Peer". H. R.
Hawthorne left for Richlands, where
a large nudience greeted them Tues?
day night.
Mr. Trinkle spoke in Graham Mon?
day night to one of the largest au?
diences that has greeted a public
speaker for years. The hall was
crowded to capacity, many being turn?
ed away at the door.
Judging from the report in the
Graham Daily News Wednesday of
the Monday night meeting, Mr. Trin?
kle must have also made a great
speech at Graham. The newspapers
report was critical in the extreme.
The inevitable conclusion is that the
speaker made a speech that will do
good for himself* and his rmrty.
MR. TRINKLE'S CROWD AND AD?
DRESS,
It id unsafe and unwise to predict,
from the size of a crowd aad the
character of the address of the speak?
er, how the voters will vote when elec?
tion day comes., but the size and en?
thusiasm of the crowd and the nature
?f the address delivered, has its sig?
nificance.
Judging from tho large attendance
here Tuesduy new interest is being
uil.en in the Democratic doctrine. Mr.
Trinkle spoke to a packed house. The
door and the halls were blocked by
people trying to bear the speaker.
The crowd was composed of Demo?
crats from all sections of the county,
and also a number of leading Repub?
licans. About two dozen ladies were
present. The remarkable thing was
that this large crowd, uncomfortably
jammed, remained, manv of the au?
dience standing throughout the entire
address. Whether out of curiosity
or whether from an earnest desire to |
hear what the candidate bad to say,
cannot be definitely or accurately
written down. Nevertheless, they re?
mained nnd a more attentive, respect?
ful audience no man ever addressed.
It is only fair to assume that an au?
dience of such respeetnbility as Mr.
Trinkle faced on Tuesdav?an au?
dience of mature, thinking men and
women, were not there from idle cu?
riosity, as was evidenced, as stated,
lhat they not only listened attentively
but remained during tho more than
two hours, showing no signs of rest?
lessness, but the most intense interest
Lo the close.
As Mr. Trinkle said in his splendid
address, this is a new day. The coun?
try is not the same as four years ago.
The people ar reading and thinking
as never before. This hide-bound,
partisan political prejudices of years
ugo, in both political parties, is pass?
ing out rapidly and forever. Mr.
Trinkle is a man of the new order.
He had new and vital things to say,
and he said them with wonderful
and telling effect and the large crowd
went away satisfied and more.
The unprecedented prosperity nnd
peace of the times in which the people
are living has had a wonderful effect
upon the people. If a man wishes to
talk about these things he can get a
hearing anywhere now. But if he
comes to regale the peoplo with a lot
of by-gone issues?if he is looking
backward instead of forward, lie is
likely to meet a frost even in hot
weather, aa are most of the Repub?
lican speakers now, whose avowed in?
tentions declared to be, is to over?
throw and tear down laws and insti?
tutions in which the whole neoplc are
rejoicing. Trinkle came to Tozewell
as the preacher of "good tidings of
grent joy" to all the people, and the
people heard him gladly. Not only
here but elsewhere it is the same. He
snid that the audience in Tazewell,
tho largest seen here for sometime,
was not as large by far as those he
had nddressed so far, in other pnrts of
the district.
NOTES AND ECHOES.
Did Trinkle make any votes in
Tazewell? Well, every Democrat
who heard him will vote for him. At
least two Republicans who heard him
said, "better let well enough alone,
I shall vote for Wilson and Slemp."
He is only willing to let "well enough"
"half alone."
A colored mnn was asked, "Well, I
suppose you will vote for Wilson and
good times in November." He snid,
"No; Wilson hnsn't treated Germany
right." Who put such stuff into that
negroes hend, do you suppose?
A number of good and loyal Repub?
licans, who did not relish Mr. Trin
kle's speech, said they would like to
have asked him one or two questions.
It was their privilege to do So. They
would have received a civil and intel?
ligent answer. However, Mr. Trinkle
gave Mr. Slemp the privilege to oc?
cupy the platform with him in this
campaign, when any question could
have been asked and answered. But
Mr. Slcmo declined "the honor" of
a joint debate.
If Mr. Slemp had "condescended" to
divide time with Mr. Trinkle he would
have been furnished an audionce and
a big one. Mr. Slemp missed the
TAZEWELL, VIR
lguished Candidate
chunce of his life. He can never get
such an audience in Taewoll unless
he outs Mr. Hughes or some other
celebrity on exhibition.
A very intelligent lady who heard
I M.r Trinkle, remarked: "Pino,
sounds like old Botetourt," and the
editor of this paper said, "Amen!
Amen!"
If the opportunity offers our friend
T. J. Munsey will Hay Trinkle alive
for dubbing him "Soup-House Tom."
The address was aptly styled, "the
old fashioned gospel of the old-time
religion in modern dress."
One well known Republican, sitting
near the front, said, after the speceli
was over, "No, I didn't like it, I'm
goin' to vote for Slemp." If this broth?
er were asked, "Why are you a Repub?
lican?" we'll wager dollars to dough?
nuts that he couldn't give an intelli?
gent answer. There might have been
a time when an answer of reasona?
ble force could have been given, but
that time seems to have passed.
There was hope that the once'great
and powerful Republican party would
have n resurrection to life and use?
fulness until it allied itself with it lot
of men?the same old lot of reac?
tionaries who helped to wreck it. Un?
til it cuts loose from its old moor?
ings there seems to be little hope.
Another party may be built upon its
ruins by Mr. Roosevelt and others, but
it wont be the same party.
TUESDAY'S ECHOES.
(By H. M. S.)
Why didn't they get a counter at?
traction here Tuesday. There were
a baker's dozen of Republicans in the
audience who might have been "saved
to the party."
If our friends the enemy bad one
speaker like Trinkle, and one griev?
ance to complain about, they would
be in betler ease.
Wo have yet to hear any Repub?
lican spell-binder with courage enough
to glorify Slemp's vote for the eight
hour Inw.
Those of them who heard Munsey
and the "Hard Shell" from Indiana,
and then sat under Trinkle, must be
asking themselves questions.
If Sleinp was right in voting foi
the eight hour law, let us ask the
primary class if the President was
right in proposing it.
Maine voted 12,500 majority against
Cleveland, and yet Cleveland was
elected. Maine's average national
majority has been 25,000.
Trinkle didn't say that Wilson
would rather be right than be Presi?
dent. He did much better. He prov?
ed it by his mngnificent record.
Slemp has a "tapper" in every elec?
tion precinct, whose duty it is to re?
port any wobbling among the faith?
ful. The report goes to the bouncer
nnd then to the boss.
The Tribune: As shown in Maine,
Hughes fight is merely personal and
Halo's fight was Hughes fight, but.
he got no suporl from Hughes und
tho leaders are wandering why.
And summing up the Herald says:
The tangle in which Hughes has in?
volved the campaign is a "just meas?
ure" of his fitness to be President in
the greatest crisis of modern civili?
zation.
WILSON.
He is not for his pnrty, or section or
Suite,
Or a syndicate's need or his private
purse,
But heart, brain and strength co-or?
dinate
For his country's estate in the uni?
verse.

gentleman from Indiana was on a
high plnne nnd wns listened to atten?
tively by n large number of the lead?
ing citizens of the county, both Re?

OUR FAIR
NEXT WEEK
Aviator, Who Will Soar in the
Clouds Will Arrive Early in
the Week?Edict Against
Drunkeness and Disorder
Will Be Enforced.
Tho Board of Directors of tho Taze?
well Pah Association have issued an
edict against drinking on tho Pair
grounds uoxt week, and havo authoriz?
ed the large number of special police
mon and olllcors to arrest every per?
son who is seen drinking or under the
influence of whiskey, and lock them
up. There has boon at previous
Pairs tragedies and accidents due
solely to the drunks, and the man?
agement of the Association has de?
termined to break up the practice,
if the jail has to be filled. Those citi?
zens who expect to eoaie to the Pair
to get drunk had belter stay at home.
AVIATOR POR TAZEWELL PAIR
WILL ARRIVE NEXT WEEK.
Monte Rolfe, the . Pnmous Uigh
Flyer of the Young Aeroplane Com?
pany's Meet of llyors, will arrive here
one day ahead of time, and have hi t
machine set up and on the ground
ready la fly, Rolfe is considered one
of the best aviators in the country,
and he being an Englishman he may
he aide to tell us some stoiies about
the war; his work is said to bo very
sensational; he will change his pro?
gram as much as possible each day.
Young Rolfe recently flew in (Ian
ton, 111., for which he recived $000.(10
for one day's Hying. This is as much
as the loop aviators get, and they
must have thought Rolfe some avia?
tor to pay this price. The Canton
Press, and the committee, praise him
and say that if any one wants to
know anything about Rolfe to ask
them.
Rolfe? Hew over l.os Angeles re?
cently, und have every one's goat, lie
(lew over the city, diped and dived,
and twisted his plane so that every?
one thought he would certainly fall
and break his neck; in fact some of
the remarks that were heard would
lead one to think that the crowd felt
that he would.
?Some of the remarks overheard
run liko this: "Look at that fool Av?
iator; he crotuinly has no sense, or
[he would never take such chances."
"Croat Scott, look at. him now."
Say Bill, if he ever falls, look out for
your beau."
The chief of Police said he would
have Rolfe arrested, but Rolfe had
been tipped off, not to laud within
the city limits, and after he thought
he had created enough disturbance,
he flew to GriflHh's Hold and phoned
the police. The chief told him to come
tin, hut warned Rolfe never to fly so
close to town again, lie told him l<>
remember the three mile limit.
The above is not intended to give
Sergeant. Thompson a tip, but that,
it might be a good thing to he on
the lookout, so that no one is on the
grounds, when he does come down.
Rolfe has been engaged for an ex?
hibition of his stunts at the Tazewell
Fair, and tho attraction will he n
feature of tho occasion. His ability
as an aviator, nnd his unusual daring
has placed him among the foremost
I in the ranks of the airmen. adv.

IltUIN AND WRECK AFTER THE
WAR.
Do the Republican speakers mean
nnd believe what they say, when they
(ell us that panic and business ruin
will follow the close of the great war'.'
Why, then, do they wish to shoulder
a shattered and ruined government?
It isn't true and those who make
the prediction do not believe it them?
selves.
Why do they not toll the people
that a large increase in our exports
is due to the sale of products other
than war munitions and with which
the war bus nothing to do. And
also, that the government has ex?
pert commissions and large corpora
lions have commissions already at
work here and in foreign countries
already, laying plans based upon sci?
entific investigation, looking not only
to holding what WO have but to a
wide extension of future trade with
these countries, and these commission
era declare that our trade and com?
merce, instead of being curtailed, will
bo greatly extended after the groat,
war is over. This is not put forth ns
i political promise, but as u culd
statement oi fnct. Rut Republican
i>rutors keep these facts in the back?
ground.
HE HAS TUBERCULOSIS?SHUT
OUT PROM CATAWBA.
A man givinc his name as Floyd,
and his home Norfolk, Va., where he
has a wife and two small children,
appeared on the streets of this town
one day this week soliciting money to
defray his railroad fare to the Gov?
ernment snnitorium in Now Mexico
for consumptives. The man, appar?
ently in the curly thirties, was ema?
ciated and weak from tho ravages of
tuberculosis and unless ho gets relief
quickly will not bo on his foot six
months longer. When asked why ho
didn't go to Clltawbn he said ho had
tried for a your to do so, but. was told
thnt there was no room, that tho san?
itarium is already over-crowded. It is
a shamu and a disgrace to this grout
State, that provision is not made to
save the lives of tho unfortunate men
and women, who are afflicted and bur?
dened with a disease which if token
in time can lie cured, but if not death
is absolutely certain. And, too, Un?
necessary provision for caring for
consumptives can be provided at u
trilling cost. Why don't somebody
go to work at this thing?

Supreme Court Decides Road
Case in Favor of the Nor?
folk & Western Railway.
Verdict of Russell Court
Reversed for Plaint ill'.
The Supreme Court of Appeals of
Virginia, at. its Stauhton term, on
September nth, decided the ease of
the Hoard of Supervisors of Tuze
well County against the Norfolk and
Western Railway Company. This
case is of interest to the people of
county on account of its hearing on
public roads generally.
It seems about two years ago tho
Board of Supervisors brought suit
against the railroad company, in
which it naked that the railway com?
pany he required, first, to furnish
tho county with a road equally as
convenient as the old road taken by
(ho railway company twenty eight
years ago, between Baven and Do
ran, when it constructed its Clinch
Valley division through Tazewell
county, and the Hoard also claimed a
right of way thirty feet wide for
county road purposes, and second,
lhal the railway company ho re
quired to build approaches to the
Raven crossing, which is on the rail?
road till.
Quito a lot of evidence, pro and
eon, was Ulken in the ease, and on u
hearing, of the ease in the Circuit
Court, the court refused to grant the
relief prayed for, nnd dismissed tho
ease at tho cost of the Hoard of Su?
pervisors. An appeal from (his (In?
cision was taken by the Hoard of Su?
pervisors to the Supreme Court, anil
in its opinion on Hie llth inst., the
Supreme Cotltr reversed the Circuit
Court in part, by requiring the rail?
way company to construct the ap?
proaches to the Raven crossing, mid
llfllrming it as to the remainder of
the road between Dorna and Haven,
Und giving judgment against (he rail?
way company for costs, which will
amount to about $tiiin. The Hoard of
Supervisors will probably file a pe?
tition for a rehearing of I he case.
BiiHsell Court Reversed,
The Supreme Court also decided tho
case of Henry Riddloy, plaintiff vs.
Lite Clinchflohi Coal Corporation, de?
fendant. This case was tried in the
Circuit Court of Russell county at
the May term, 1014, The jury as?
sessed plaintiff's damages at, $(1000,
hui (he judge sustained the defend?
ant's demurrer to (he evidence and
set aside th verdict and entered judg?
ment, for the defendant. Plaintiff ap?
pealed the case to the Supreme Court,
of Virginia and oh last Monday that.
Court reversed (he judgment of the
lower court, and entered up judgment,
on the verdict in favor of Hiddlcy,
who will now get the StiODO, with in?
terest and costs,
Riddloy was represented by Win. H.
Worth, of Tazewell, and M. M. Cong,
of the Wise county bar.
