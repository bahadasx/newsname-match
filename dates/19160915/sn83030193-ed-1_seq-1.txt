Fogarty out tho door, with me bohlnd,
when he knocked Fogarty ono side,
ran to the edge of tho platform and
Jumped to the embankment, landing on
his head.
"The rear end brake man pulled
tho emergency vuhu and tho train
stopped within a fow yards. Wo
went over the railing Just as Walton
en rose and ran down the track. We
caught him after two hundred yards
Ho was dazed nnd badly cut about

CHARGES AGAINST PRIESTS
IN H W RE-TAPPNG CASE
ARE DISMISSED BY COURT
Justice Grecnbaum Declares
Evidence Produced Is
Insufficient.
NO PROOF OF A IfLOT.
Wire Tapping Police Obeyed
Orders of Their Superiors,
Says Court.
Justice Ureenbnum of the Supremo
Court to-day dismissed the complaints
against tho rtov. Mgr. John J. Dunn,
tho Ilov. William 11. Fan-ell, Robert
W. Hcbbord, formerly Secretary of
tho Stato Hoard ot Charities, and
Daniel C. Potter, who were charged
by members of Mayor Mttchel's offi
cial family with conspiring to ob
struct Justice and criminal libel grow
ing out of the charities Investigation
Inst spring. Justlco Greenbnum, who,
sitting as a Magistrate, heard all tho
evldcnco a few months ago, declared
tfiero was iusulllclcnt evidence.
While Mayor Mltchel and his chari
ties' commissioner, John A. Kings
bury, were active In the controversy,
the charges against tho four men
were mado actually by William J.
Dohorty, Second Deputy Charily
Commissioner. Tho conspiracy charge
alleged that tho four men had ar
ranged to provent certain witnesses
from appearing at tho charity In
quiry beforo tho Strong committee.
The criminal libel charge was basod
on statements printed 1n pamphlets
Issued by tho Dev. William n. Far
roll, and said to have been prepared
by the latter and Mr. Potter. An ad
ditional charge of perjury was made
against Mr. Hebberd.
The charges made by certain labor
officials that Police Commissioner
Woods violated ti.n law In having
their telephone messages Intercepted
waa also dismissed.
In his findings Justlco nrrenhaum,
whllo stating that tho ovldanca pre
sented by the policemen attached to
tho wire tapping squad was In
sufficient to constitute n case, says
that the pollcemon showed they had
made nn honest effort to perform the
duty to which they had been
assigned.
3AYB WIRETAPPERS SIMPLY
OBEYED THEIR ORDERS.
In regard to tho conspiracy charge
Justlco Grecnbaum says:
"The complaint largoly relied upon
tho testimony of tho officers who com
posed the spoclal detoctlvo squad
whose duty It was to report tolcphone
conversations for the purposo of de
tecting crlmo. A vast amount of tes
timony wnji taken beforo mo and tho
testimony of pollco officers Justllles
tho finding that they wcro faithfully
discharging duties assigned to them
by the pollco commissioner, and that
their testimony wns of higher value
than that of the ordinary witness who
may attempt to repeat' conversation
In which he had no special Intorest.
"Hut giving full effect to thts testi
mony of the police officers, which in
tho main waa not contradicted, It
falls far short of establishing a
criminal conspiracy. The most that
may be claimed Is that the defend
ants, who were deeply Interested In
the work of the Strong Commission,
discussed from time ' to tlmo ways
and means for defeating a movement
which they believed had boon Insti
tuted to subvert the system of In
stitutional charities and sought to
prevent their opponents, as thoy be
lieved them, from receiving any In
formation concerning themselves,

MITCHEL IS TOLD
Inlerborough Would Bring on
uothcr Strike by Arbitration,
Delegation Declares.
CONTRACT IS LAUDED.
Brotherhood President Says All
but 1,194 Have Signed Work
ing Agreement.
Fifty-four members of tho Urother-
hood of lnterborough Employees, rep
resenting tho officers and executive
committee, and accompanied by At
torney Jntnes li. Quackenbush, called
on Mayor Mltohcl In City Hall to-day.
During the conference a threat was
mado that It tho Intorborough at
tempted "to arbitrate with anybody
it will put It.t foot In It."
What was meant was that the em
ployees ot tho lnterborough are per
fectly satisfied with tho individual
working agreements nnd that the
lnterborough will havo anothur strlka
on Its hands If It nttempta to go Into
tho question of arbitration with tho
men who aro now on strlko.
It was explained that 10,306 out of
11,800 lnterborough omployocH have
signed whnt Is known as thu "master
and servant" agreement. J, J. Harrl
gun, President of tho Drothorhood
said:
"We represent 10,300 of tho 11,800 In
terborough employees. This mooting
Is a spontaneous ono. It was not sug
gested by tho management of tho ln
terborough. We camo here to assure
you, Mr. Mayor, that a large ma
jority of the lnterborough employees
mo satisfied and will not yield to vio
lence, intimidation, coercion or
threats."
"Wo havo malntalnod a service
more than 100 per cent, efficient and
havo carried mors people during the
alleged strike than during a corre
sponding period last year.
"We have become a part of tho
government of the lnterborough.
Under our constitution and by-laws
tho Drotherhood Is the house of rep
resentattvus. Tho management of
tho road Is tho senato and the prrs
Idcnt la the board ot arbitration to
bo appolntod It we can't come to
gether."
Deports wore road by representa
tives of tho various departments
bearing out tho Intorborough's claim
that very fow of tho employees
aro on strike.
"Are you satisfied with the police
protection given you during this
strlko?" asked Mayor Mltchel.
Harrigan, answering for the men,
said:
','We are. All we ask you to do Is
to continue the good work of the
Pollco Department In protecting us."
"The City of New York has no part
In this matter, exnjpt to protect th
public Interests and see that the laws
are enforced," said Mayor Mltchel.
"We are not taking a partisan at
titude."
Harry Post, one of thn last speak
ers, said It was not the deslro of the
present employees ot the Interboro to
have arbitration.
"We are perfectly satisfied with the
working agreements," said Post, "be
cause it was our men who helped
draw them up. It tho Intorborough
attempts to arbitrate now on thts
question ot agreements It will put Its
foot In it good and hard. Tho men
are psrteotly satlsflod, If you step
Into the subway or take an "V train
to-day you will not find any Indica
tion of a strmo. Ail the men are
working faithfully and thoy are hap
py ond contented. Therefore, why
should the Interborjugh go Into this
arbitration question Just to planan a
comparatively smull number who
havo deserted their Jobs'"
Mayor Mltohol had no comment to
moke oa the mooting.
