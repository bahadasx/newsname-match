Speed Automobiles Come Together.
Wheels Torn Off.
Seven persons were severely injur-j
ed in an automobile accident on the
cemetery hill road, about seven o'clock
Saturday evening. The hill road is
very steep and narrow at the point
where the mishap occurred and the'
fact that no one was killed remains
a mystery, as two cars crashed to- j
gether, tearing the rear wheel off each |
and turning the cars completely over. !
Mrs. J. I. Lebert, Madge, Plank and
Byron Lebert, Mrs. Verne Hovej' and
Ethel Hovey occupied one car and T.
P. White, his wife and little girl were;
in the other. From eve witnesses'.
, . , . . i
of the accident it is reported that the:
. . , 1
Lebert car attempted to pass the
., ....
White car and in doing so the cars
were thrown together with great force
. . , , . , . . «
just at the top of a short raise in the
,
road. In an instant both were thrown
over and the occupants plunged onto;
the ground, receiving many bruises
many
but no bones being broken. All were
taken to the Deaconess hospital where
their wounds were dressed and the
parties then taken to their homes.
Mr. White remained at the hospital
for internal injuries he received and
for a time it was feared there might
be serious results. He was finally
removed to his home near Nashua
for several days receiving treatment
where he is resting easy and it is
expected he will fully recover within
a short time.
The Fair Association made every
precaution to aVoid accidents of this
nature during the fair, placing signs
directing drivers how to travel, and
the police and sheriff's departments
lent valuable aid, so that nothing oc
curred during the three days of the
fair. It is regrettable that so serious
an accident should happen just as the
last dav closed.
ESTABLISH BRANCH HERE
The McKinney-Fuller Motor Com
pany with headquarters at Grand
Forks and with branches at Minot
and Williston have decided to open
a branch house in Glasgow. The
managers of the company were here
the fore part of the week and arrange
ments will be made for the erection
of a modern garage and supply house.
The company has the western agency
for the Dodge Brothers cars and the
local branch will carry a stock of cars
as well as a complete line of supplies
and accessories. E. A. Edberg, well
known in this county and for the past
year connected with the Grossman Mo
tor Company, has been appointed local
manager for the company and Mr.
Edberg informs the Courier that the
new house will be completed and ready
for business this fall.

FATAL SHOOTING
BY HALF BREED
JOHN MARTEL MURDERS EN
GINEER OVER TRIFLING AR
GUMENT.
John Martel, a half breed Indian,
who has been operating a threshing
rig in this locality, shot and instant-'
at the John Scott farm, one mile north
of Froid at an early hour Tuesday
morning. Martel walked into town
shortly afterwards and gave himself
up to the local authorities and was
later taken to the county jail at Plen
tywood where he is awaiting a hear
The trouble between the two arose,
over the possession of a time book
which the engineer had in his
session, having kept the time for him
self and the rest of the crew. Sper
ling wanted to quit and demanded a
settlement with Martel who refused
to settle and made threats that he
would shoot unless the time book was
turned over. This, Sperling refused
to do, and started to leave the cook
car.
,, , ,
Martel then ran to a hay rack;
nearby where a 30-30 rifle lay loaded,
picked up the weapon and called to
one of the crew who was in line with
Sperling to step aside that he was
going to shoot, and as soon as the
■ 1 . , i . , , , ,, ,
other fellow had stepped back, Martel
leveled the rifle at Sperling and pull
ed the trigger. The bullet entered
Sperling's right lung, and he dropped
dead on the spot, the bullet passing
completely through the body.

Ator, and Assistant County Attorney
C. R. Ellery, were at once notified of
the murder and came down and held
an inquest Tuesday night. The jury
rendered a verdict that the deceased
came to his death from a bullet fired
from a rifle in the hands of one John
Martel. Sperling's body has been em
balmed and his relatives in Richmond,
Virginia, have been notified by wire.
Parties' who are acquainted with the
deceased, say that his parents are
well to do people. Up to this writ
ing nothing as to the disposition of
the remains, but it is thought that
particulars will be received today.
Martel, it is said, has always been:
rather a disagreeable character and
has caused considerable trouble on
former occasions. At the time of the
killing he did not appear to realize
the seriousness of his act, but later
on in the jail at Plentywood the
thought of prison bars or possibly
the hang-man's noose, commenced to
upon his mind, and he showed
signs of nervousness. Sperling, as
fas as is known, was a peaceful fel
low and only wanted pay for the labor
he had performed. We are told that
carried a $7,000.00 paid up life in-1
surance policy payable to his mother
and that he made the last payment
last Saturday at Medicine Lake.
Martel's trial will probably come up
J at this term of District Court in Plen
' tlwood. Feeling against him here
is bitter. His family resides near
| Homestead. Sperling is supposed to
be a single man and was about thirty
■ years of age.— Froid Tribune.

ever before and all who saw the fair
were profuse in their praise for its
merits. Altogether the fair this
year was well worth the time, labor,
and money expended and proved a
great event.
Among the live stock exhibits were
some of the finest and best bred dairy
stock to be found in the state, shown
in herds by C. M. Peterson of Nashua,
VV. W. Mabee, John Hineman and
others, who brought in their stock at
a great expeu.-e to themselves. This
department showed in a most forceful
manner the great development in the
quality of farm stock in Valley Coun
ty during the past five years since the
first fair was held. Other live stock
t exhibits were made by H. L. Sprague
who> at the special reqU est of the Fair
Valley County's Fifth Annual Ag-[
ricultural lair closed Saturday after
three days of fast races, free shows
and the best exhibit of live stock ever
shown. The grain and vegetable dis
play was not as large as that of pre-j
vious years owning to the fact that
many farmers had not as yet threshed
their grains and the vegetables were
not as yet ready for showing. The
attendance was greater this year than

Why Timm Did Not Fly
at the Valley County Fair
:
The following taken from the Des,
Moines Register-Leader will give th»
people of Valley County some idea of
the wreck his machine sustained at
the Iowa State Fair and why Otto
Timm did not appear at Glasgow to
fill the dates he had here.
"Otto W. Timm, the nervy Grinnell
aviator who stepped into the breach
of the first night program at the
state fair to make the illuminated
flight which Ruth Law's manager
! had prevented her making, narrowly
i escaped injury last night when, after
a magnificent exhibition of aviation,:
he steered his machine into the inner
fence of the race track and wrecked
| it as he came down for a landing.
He escaped unhurt but the plane was
1 demolished beyond repair.

j stand and the throngs who had fol
lowed him with their eyes as he cir

1 winner although he did not intend to
enter the competition. Mr. Griffith
is one of the regular exhibitors at the
fair and always shows keen interest;
in its development.
j Among the winners in the agricul
; tural department were F. L. Beizer,
j C. M Peterson, C. A. Collins, Robt. I
Mou-, M. Domke, Herman Seiving, Ole
S ter. .-land, John Dietsman, Dick Rich

Me

year showing the growing in
i among the farmers being dis
play i- With the coming years it is
r.r. assured fact that the exhibit build
) will not lie large enough to hold
:'U that will be brought to the fair.
Jas. Griffin, of Chinook, who judged
the agricultural products stated that
the grain shown here was the best
lie has examined this fall and as he
I ad just completed a trip over the en
tire state it is evident that the wheat
and other grains of Valley wil 1 stand
well at the state fair this year.
The woman's building as well as the
j flower exhibit this year was most
interesting. All the various depart
ments were rilled to a greater extent
j ,'han ever before, especially is this so
| of the culinary department where the
j eed case made to hold these exhibits
was not large enough to accommodate
| them. The ladies of the county dis
play a very marked interest in the
! premium list and the competition was
j keen for even- prize. The butter ex
! hibit was greater than ever shown, the
bread and cookies were crowded foi
la very fine array of glasses and al
j most everything than can be canned,
j room as was the cukes and pies. Th"
I jelly and preserve departments made
prise m trie great variety of work it
_ ...
preserved or jellied was to be found.
Among the exhibitors in this depart
ment were many girls under 10 years
of age who carried off some of the

to be proud of and those who exam
ined this department met with a sur

be. Mrs. Frazer, Miss Johonnott,
Prof. Williams, Huber, Lawton, and
Gould, and manv others interested in

school work labored hard for many

to arrange the exhibit. It contained

the dark when the torches burned
out and after an interval heard him
swooping down toward the track
from the west. *
Dives to the Ground
There was a crash and a burst of
white flame as the tip of the left
plane caught the rail of the fence
and the machine dived on its nose'
to the ground, but the flame was that!
of an unburned torch and the ma
chine did not take fire.
As the torch lighted Timm was
seen to leap from his seat and rush
| to extinguish it, lest the gasoline tank
ignite. The propeller and both upper
and lower planes of the left wing and
the carriage were shattered. The mo-1
tor was not damaged according to
Timm. He started immediately the
work of repairs."
