Mr. I,amont's address was as fol
lows:
k. ^ chnrch is a place of worship?!
hut In the more general acceptation ,
of the word?a building In which to
worship. All buildings cannot he
classed as architecture because they
have no architectural merit but we
assume that churches may rightfully
be classed as such and endeavor to
prove the assumption.
Architecture and religion have
borne a rather peculiar relationship
since the very dawn of creation. In
the beginning God created the
heavens and the earth. A creation
that man with all his superior knowl
edge haH not been able to comprehend
We have arrived at a few funda
mental principles, but who except1
the Great Architect would attempt
anything so Infinite. I do not be-'
"eve God simply threw matter out'
into space promiscuously. He worked :
to a definite plan and purpose and!
gave a distinction to each particular!
of His work, for are we not told that
there Is one glory of the sun, an
other of the moon, and another glory
of the stars, but all la glory, and
when he had finished a particular
part of It He saw It was good?and
only after he wis satisfied and
Pleased with this, the greatest pos-!
slhle work or architecture, did He i
turn It over to man to see It he could
appreciate and behold Its beauty.
iThen alter He made man and had
[given him domjnloh ov6r all that He
had created in the earth He said
Thou shalt and thou shall not"?a
,.rm worship?the beginning of
all religion. ?
After man failed In his part of the
contract he was cast out or the Gar
J den or Eden. and. was left pretty
much to his own Ingenuity to pro
vide for himself. So we find archi
tecture had Its origin In the efforts
of man to provide for hiniRolf a
means br protection ngnlnnt the In
clemency of the weather. At this
period of the world's, hlstorv man
kind was divided into three general
classes, hunters, shepherds, and agri
culturists. Tbe hunters dwelt most
ly in rock cllfts or caveB, while the
shepherd pitched his tent wherever
night might overtake him in his
wanderings with his flockB; but the
agriculturist became a permanent
resident where he tilled the soil,
sowed hlB seed and gathered his
crops.
Hence we find different forms ot
habitation tor different claBsea or
people, which rorms differ in different
climates and localities. In the agri
culturists we find the nucleus or a
community and to this class we must
look tor the founders or a cltv and
the constructors or permanent dwell
ings tombs and temples and other!
architecture which serve as monu-l
ments of Instruction to-future gen
eratlons.
But construction alone Is not
architecture, for It may ho found
among the most uncivilized people;
only when It Is governed by sys
tematic laws of proportion, which are

FIX THE BRIDGE
It is Not Enough Just to Warn
the Public That the Same
is Dangerous.
The Montlcello bridge connecting
the city and Broad Oaks Is In a most
dangerous condition. The county
road engineer says so, too, as he
placed a sign there several days ag#
warning the public that the bridge 1#
In a dangerous condition and that
people would cross It at their own
risk. The authorities have taken no
farther step.
The abutments are about to fait
down and the steel work ot the
bridge has rotted. Use ot the bridge
Is very necessary and the authorities
should act at once. It Is not enough
to warn the public.
