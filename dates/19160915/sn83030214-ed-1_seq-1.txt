Favors Walk-Out,
Tho Amalgamated 1'nion ha**
abandoned its attempt t<> win tha
traction strike in the way it first
planned. In the face of yesterday's
unprece.lenteal increase in trolley ac
tivity 00 all lines, which .spelled dc
feat of the original effort to MranglA
traffic, the union leaders made ready
to play the tir.-t of the two hiph carda
they still hold.
To-morrow nighl the sympathetic
strike of from 60,006 to lOjMM work?
ers in trades allied with car opera?

the Amalgamated, helieves this to har
an impoaaibflity.
I.eneral Walk-Out Doubtful.
The fina! card the labor chieftai-a-i
hold is a general walk-out of the
750,000 iinii.ti workers of the greater
city. Hut thi- is a doul.tf il ally.
Union leaders admit privately that
if the strike of the 60,666 rati't swing
victory to the car men ROtking Britt,
The lack of coordination l.etween thi
unions se.ms to rendt-r a nlanket
strike highly conjertural under any
conditions.
Holland made hi? assertion at /a
meeting of 10,006 itaiklng <'ar men
and sympathizers at a mass nrecting
in I'nion Square at the end of a f.a
mda of the stnkitip car workers.

was held la Lyceum Hall, at Willough

nuncia'ions of llBBSfB. Shonts. Hedley
and Whitridge, ar.d recommended that
every union be ready to answer a striku

strike resolutions ?*:':1 be rushed be?
