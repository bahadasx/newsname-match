GOLDFIELD MIXES
INCREASE PRODUCTION'
The past week has been marked
by events in Gold field that have sig
nalized the beginning of a now epoch
for the camp's sustaining industry.
These events are destined to not only
bring a material increase in the pro
duction and earnings of the leading
mining 'companies, but will greatly
prolong the productive life of mines
throughout the district. Mine devel
opments of unusual importance, have
been relegated to second place by the
placing In commission of the new oil
notation plant of the Goldfield Con
solidated, with 1000 tons daily capa
city, and the successful operation of
the flotation plant of the Florence
company, which is treating 200 tons
daily, says the Tribune.
Three mines in the district, the
Silver . Pick, Florence and Lone Star,
have reported developments of great
significance, while at several other
points development work is at a
stage where discoveries of pay ore
may be announced at any time.
Those who are in close touch with
the mine conditions here are on the
pinnacle of expectancy; convinced of
the imminence of developments of
the greatst imeportance to the entire
district,
From this time forward the metal
production of Goldfield district is
destined to show a substantial in
crease, Interruptions caused by
changing its mill from the cyunide to
the flotation process resulted in a
curtailment of output for two r
three months by the Consolidated
Mines company, but hereafter h3 big
mill will be treating 1000 ton? of ore
daily, and It is said that thia product
will be of better grade than tha a tr
age handled in recnt jnontha. Re
ports of the Jumbo Extension com
pany Indicate that it is no poatuble
to determine the limits of trie main
ore. body, but the normal production
will be ' maintained for several
months. The Florence mine, which
has -not been productive for some
time past,' is now assured a substan
tlan and highlyprofitable output.
Held Next Tuesday
TO
present deputy treasurer and clerk,
have urged her to enter the race for
the nomination and she has consent
ed to do so. As yet no Republicans
have declared themselves; however,
Cius Blad and Claire Norris of Cali
ente have been mentioned. For as-
sessor, Dan J. Ronnow will be the
Democratic nominee and it may be
that he will have no opponent; but
that will be determined by the Re
publican convention delegates. For
district attorney it seems sure
that A. L. Scott will be the Demo
cratic nominee, while the Republi
cans will, in all liklihood, nominate
Tom Osborne for the place. For
county commissioner, long term, Will
Hammond of Eagle Valley, Phil
Mathews of Panaca and E. C. D.
Marriage of Pioche will be candidates
before the Democratic county con
vention, and the only Republican
that has declared himself as a candi
date is J. N. Hollinger, present chair
man of the board, and a resident of
Spring Valley. Some friends of E.
Kahn have been flirting with him
with the object of getting him to say
h would run, but the Record has not
been informed that he has said the
word. Mr. Kahn is the well known
Pioche merchant. No one but James
Ryan seems to want th short term
commissionership. Anyway, the Re
publicans of Lincoln county have the
habit of letting Jim have his own
way and indications are that they
wiH do so this year. It seems to be
conceded that W. T. Stewart, Sr., of
Alamo will be the Democratic nomi
nee for state senator; M. L. Lee, who
served the county in the last. session
of the legislature, is mentioned as
the Republican nominee, while Dr. J.
f). Campbell will run independently.

NEVADA-UTAH
MILL .WORKING FIXE
According to information impart
ed by Supt. H. R. Van Wagenen of
I the' Amalgamated Pioche Mines &
Smelters corporation just before his
departure for Denver last Tuesday,
the Con. Nevada Utah mill continues
to do excellent work and is handling
from 10 to 20 per cent more tonnage
than the plant was built for. The
principal dump, formed during the
hand sorting days of the company
and from which the mill has been
drawing considerable tonnago in tlie
past few months, has been entirely
cleaned up and the mill is now fee.";
iiijt wholly from the mine, where
two shifts of men are employed.
The prospecting work on the 1403
level has revealed a narrow vein
which has brought in considerable
water, and which shows values tn
pold, silver and lead. This disclos
ure is in entirely new country and
Mr. Van Wagenen states, may rieuu
rew ore bodies; however, there can
be no assurance of this until devel
opment is carried further along
MRS. JENNIE WILCOX

Mrs. Jennie Wilcox has announced
that she will go before the Demo

METALLURGICAL ENGINEER SHERWOOD GIVES DESCRIPTION OF
PI.AXT WHICH IS TO WORK OVER TAILINGS AT BULLION'
VILLE AND DRY VALLEY- PRINTED IX SALT LAKE
MIXING JOURNAL
A recent issue, of ths Salt Lake
Mining Review contains the follow
ing description of the Bullionvillo
mill of the Prince Consolidated Min
ing & Smelting company, which wa;
written by C. F. Sherwood, late met
allurgical engineer for the Prince
company:
"The mill just completed for i,hc
Prince Consolidated Mining & Smell
ing Company for the treatment "of
the Bullionville and Dry Valle;' tail
ings is located half a mile rrom he
station of Panaca, Nevada, on the
Pioche branch of the Los Aneeles &
Salt Lake railroad. The mill is lo
cated on the site of the oli smelter
at the former camp of Bullionville,
which at one time had a papulation
of over 5,000.
"The tailings which this mill is
designed to treat are approximatel;
forty years old, being the result of
old milling practices on the earlier
ores from the Pioche district. They
have most of them been retreated
by pan amalgamation and cyandiza
tion. "The Dry Valley tailings, which
are identical with the Bullionville
tailings, are shipped by rail from
Dry Valley to the mill at Bullionville.
All these tailings are highly silioious
and oxidized entirely, containing the
following values: Lead, 8.2 per cent;
silver, 11 ounces; gold, $1.40.
"The lead occurs entirely as i car;
bonate and the silver. practJcaHyal!
a chloride; consequently" any
method of gravity concentration
would give an extremely low recov
ery of metallic contents. The method
best found from a metallurgical
standpoint is the artificial filming tr
l'phidizing of the lead carbonate
ith a sulphide film. The principle

POSED TO BE THE CAUSE t
(Special to the Record)
CALIENTE. Nevada, September 14
This town was the scene of a
shooting scrape last Sunday after
noon which resulted in the killing of
Tim Mahoney, who has been employ
ed for sometime as engineer on the
Caliente & Pioche railroad. The
man who did the shooting was C. E
Dawsou, a fireman on the Salt Lake
Route. The tragedy happened near
the roadway to the rear of the store
of A. H. Norris; six shots were fired
in all, one of which pierced the heart
of ths clli;j.
The trouble is alleged to have
been one of long standing and rrew
out of what Dawson claims to have
been Mahoney's determination to
ruin his home. It is claimed that
Dawson warned Mahoney that dire
consequences would result if he dM
not change his wayi. Anyway, the
two men met on the street Sunday
even'ng and Dawson pulled a revol
ver and began firing with the result
stated. The slaye., of Mahoney i;av
himself up to Deputy Sheriff Re
Mathews soon after the shooting.
