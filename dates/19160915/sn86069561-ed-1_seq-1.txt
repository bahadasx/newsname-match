that clever cryital-glait pound

splendid condition.
P. A. puts new joy
into the sport of
smoking!
YOU may live to
be 110 and never
feel old enough to
vote, but it's certain-sure
you'll hot
know the joy and
contentment of a
friendly old jimmy
pipe or a hand rolled
cigarette unless you get on talking-terms
with Prince Albert tobacco I
P. A. comes to you with a real reason for all the
goodness and satisfaction it offers. It is made by
a patented process that removes bite and parch !
You can smoke it long and hard without a come
back! Prince Albert has always been sold without
coupons or premiums. We prefer to give qualityl
Prince Albert affords the keenest pipe and cigarette
enjoyment! And that flavor and fragrance and
coolness is as good as that sounds. P. A. just
answers the universal demand for tobacco
without bite, parch or kick-back!
Introduction to Prince Albert isn't any harder
than to walk into the nearest place that sells
tobacco and ask for "a supply of P. A" You pay
out a little change, to be sure, but it's the cheer
fullest investment you ever made!
