Members ot the U.S. Army
General Staff Have 'Hunch'
That Villa Is Preparing
for a Spectaclar Stunt
Washington, Sept 15. The pri
vate, whispered hunch of many mem
bers of the army general staff circu
lated through the war department
today la that Francisco VUla is plan
ning what he hopes to he a mixture
of sweet revenge and the coup d'etat
of his spectacular up and down life.
' Inquiry from several members of
the staff today developed the same
answer to the question: "Do you be
lieve Villa Is allveT"
The answer inevitably was: "I
most certainly do."
And almost Inevitably detailing of
the hunch followed. Each officer
emphasized it was a "pure hunch,"
but based on letters that read very
much like similar letters received a
month or two prior to the lost Mex
ican crisis, which caused at least one
major general to prophesy Just what
afterward occurred.
The hunch Is that .Villa, nursing
resentment over the Carransa recog
nition hy the United States, plans a
series of lightning like (border raids,
just as close to election time as com
patible with strategy. Army officers
generally do not fear any real Villa
activity until Pancho has spent sev
eral weeks more gathering ammuni
tion and as many of his old follow
ers as possible, In order to make It
necessary for the Carranza-Unlted
States field armies to enter Into oper
ations against him on a larger scale
than either would want to at such a
time. v
