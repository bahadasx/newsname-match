NUMBER 12
COLUMBIA LAND WILL
BE TESTER FOR OIL
Local Business Men Form
Temporary Organization
to Develop Property.
TO SINK TEST WELL
Experts Contend That Oil-
Contaming Ridge Runs
Near This City.
A county corporation, with s prob
able capitalization of $10,000. though
to develop the property, will be
formed stiortly In Columbia to de
velop the oil property in the north
west portion of Columbia, If the tests
now being conducted 'show enough
percentage of oil to make its extrac
tion a profitable commercial enter
prise. A temporary organization was
formed yesterday afternoon at a
meeting of a number of real estate
and business men in the directors
room of the Boone County Trust Com
pany. Each man present was assess
ed $10 to defray the expense of sink
ing the test well, the lawyers fees
and to help in obtaining oil leases
from the owners of the property.
The test well now being sunk on
the property of J. H. Sapp at its
present depth of six hundred feet has
shown a gratifying percentage of oil.
The well will be sunk to a depth of
fifteen hundred feet, at which point it
will be known without a doubt
whether there is enough oil present
to make its extraction profitable.
The cost of sinking the well is any
where from one to four dollars a foot,
depending on the kind of ground that
is encountered. According to the ad
vice of an Oklahoma expert who has
looked over the property, if the well
is shot with dynamite at a depth of
five hundred feet, any oil present will
gush up.
There is oil in Illinois, and oil In
Oklahoma and Columbia, if Professor
E. A. Fessenden's contention is cor
rect. The oil is supposed to be in
tbe ride of oil-containing land running
from near Salem. 111., through to Okla
homa. That of all the stratas of rock and
soil tested, only one indicates no oil,
and nine indicate a plentiful supply,
is the statement of one of the oil ex
perts from Oklahoma now in the com
pany's cmply.
There is no troube in getting
leases, since by the terms of the
lease, the owners are permitted to
take for personal UBe some of the oil
and gas found on their property, be
sides being paid for the privilege of
having wells bored, and a percentage
of the output.
The officers of the temporary or
ganization are: S. C. Hunt, president;
S. P. Conley, secretary; and R. B.
Price, Jr., treasurer. Among the
members are: S. C. Hunt, F. S. Con
ley, C. B. Miller, S. H. Levy, J. A.
Hudson, A. II. Schwabe, Carl Kerr,
H. H. Banks, William Farley and Ira
T. G. Stone.
Ben Hutchison, a representative of
the Standard Oil Company, was in
Columbia some time ago, with test
ing apparatus for use in drilling for
oil in Fayette, where some oil has
been found, according to S. H. Levy
of Columbia.

TO TALK J ORIENT
Prof. Frank Lee Martin to
Address State Press
Association.
Frank L. Martin of the School of
Journalism left this afternoon for
Kansas City, where he will attend the
Saturday meetings of the Missouri
Press Association. Professor Martin
will address the journalists tomorrow
evening at their annual banquet on
"The Journalism of Japan."
Dean Water Williams and J. B.
Powell of the School of Journalism
have been attending all the meetings
of the association, which began yes
terday. Mr. Powell opened today's
session with a talk on "Advertising
Rates," while Dean Williams will also
address the editors.
Mayor Edwards of Kansas City in
his welcoming talk yesterday told the
editors of some ways in which they
could help Kansas City. He pointed
out the increasing cost of the social
service program of the big cities and
the limitations of the cities' taxing
power under the present laws.
As a remedy for this condition the
mayor suggested separating the city
and county tax assessments, permis
sion for the city to purchase public
service utilities if necessary and
charge the bonded debt against the
utility and not against the general
debt, thus making for povv er and home
rule in police affairs in Kansas City.
He invited the editors to notice the
city conditions and help them, if they
could.
Where there are two or more news
papers in small towns, they should
double up and double their prices,
said J. Kelly Pool, president of the
asosclatton, in his annual address
yesterday afternoon TIip publisher
of the Central ia Courier thought this
was the only way out for the small
town newspaper in the fact of in
creasing prices of all materials. This
Is the day of fewer, better and higher
priced papers, he continued and con
solidation of the papers would be
better not only for the papers but the
public as well.
tin closing Mr. Pool urged a wider
sphere of Influence and enlarged ac
tivities for the organization during
the coming year.
Floyd C. Shoemaker, secretary of
the Missouri Press Association, has
just completed a history of the fifty
years of the organization. The rec
ord shows that the association has
always taken the lead not only in the
development of the press of the state,
but also in every worthy project for
upbuilding Missouri.
Among its principal achievements
was the obtaining of the Missouri
School of Journalism. The editors be
gan working for this twenty years
ago and ke.nt right at it until the
present school was established in
1907.
The association has also been right
behind the University and the normal
schools ih their fight for more ade
quate funds. It founded the State
Historical Society in 1898 after a
short campaign, and has been work
ing for good roads since 1901. Edu
cating the people as well as the edi
tors has been one of the strong points
of the organization.

WABASH PASSENGERS NOW.
MISS DEPOT EXIT CHAOS
A mass of wildly gesticulating ne
groes choking up the exit from the
Wabash depot, blocking up the slde--walk,
fairly grabbing your suitcase
out of your bands, and almost show
ing you into a taxi by their volubility
before jou know it, making a hubbub
that alm'ost drowns the noise of the
panting engine all that is but a
memory now. Gone is another insti
tution familiar to the town, and glad
dening the hearts of the Incoming
students. And as always, the minions
of the law are to blame.
Beginning this week the represent
atives of the various transfer com
panies and the public taxi companies
were assigned definite sections on the
station platform just in the shailiw of
the waiting room, with the limits
marked by red lines red deuoting
danger. When the passengers come
in, the men stand in a row just inside
the box limits, and set up their hulla
baloo about the unrivalled excellence
of their particular service.
No game can develop far without
being systematized and rules estab
lished. Before, the race was to the
most ingratiating and to the strongest,
or to those who were fast on their
feet. Now the race Is not to the swift
but to the strongest-lunged. The local
police are umpires, and see that no

Washington Telegram Asks
Number of Cars Removal

CARRANZA ON GUARD
Feared Villa Would Attack
' Chihuahua City Indepen
dence Day,
By United rress.
EL PASO, Tex., Sept. 15. That
tentative plans have been made for
withdrawing of the national guard
from the border was revealed today
when telegrams from Washington
reached every guard commander, ask
ing) how many tourist and stock-cars
would be necessary to transport the
troops back to their respective mobili
zation points. Guard officers this aft
ernoon arc making up a report of the
number of cars needed.
When receipt of the telegrams
spread over the militia camps here it
caused a buzz of excitement among
officers, who believe it forecasts an
early withdrawal of the guardsmen.
Army officers at headquarters,
however, pointed out that the actual
withdrawal may be weeks or months
distant, as this is but the first move.
After the homeward movements begin
it will require several weeks, as the
transportation to their home states of
100,000 troops with limited trackage
is a huge problem.
Carranza Guards Against Uprising.
By United Press.
'JUAREZ, Mexico, Sept. 15. Ex
traordinary precautions were taken
to prevent revolutionary uprisings
here on the occasion of the celebra
tion of national independence day to
day. Carranza troops are guarding every
street, and civilians carrying arms are
bdn" urrested. Only persona regis
tered and known to the officials will
be permitted to hear the reading of
"Grito" (the Mexican declaration of
independence).
It was reported to the military au
thorities here this afternoon that Vil-
lista bandits are pillaging in the out
skirts of Chihuahua City. The peo
ple feared that Villa will make good
his threat to attack the city on in
dependence day.
'ew Der.-ee Will Revise Government
Dy United Press.
MEXICO CITY, Mex., Sept. 15.
Mexico Is about to secure her place
among the republics of the Western
Hemisphere, after years or revolution
ary disturbances! A decree issued by
Carranza on the eve of the anniver
sary of Mexicon independence paves
the way for the de facto government
to.be replaced by a substantial con
stitutional government.
The decree calls for a revision of
several articles of the constitution
and makes provisions for the election
of members of a national congress.
Another decree will be issued tomor-
one edges over the line. As in all
well regulated games, there is a pen
alty for breaking the rules or in lieu
thereof, a brief sojourn as the guest
of the city.
It Is the opinion of th eauthorities
that the solicitations are a nuisance
and a confusion to the passengers and
must be stopped. Action has been
taken so as to avoid annoying the hun
dreds of students who are pouring In
to the city.
A city ordinance provides for the
regulation of transfer and taxi agents,
prohibiting the soliciting of baggage
or taxi service on the platform or
while the trains are coming in or go
ing out. Hitherto the baggage men
and taxi agents have blocked up the
walk before the depot and caused
much confusion. It was In an effort
to abate the nuisance that, by agree
ment with the local Wabash agent,
definite sections on the platform were
assigned to the agents of the transfer
and taxi companies.
Chief of Police Whitesides and day
officer Miller are on duty to see that
there are no violations of the ordi
nance. Since arrests may be made
on the charges of blocking the side
walk, creating a nuisance, disturbing
the peace, cr trespassing on private
property, there is little danger of any
one wilfully breaking the ordinance.

Mexican Troops In Their Place.
(United Press Staff Correspondent)
NEW LONDON, Conn., Sept. 15. If
General Pershing's troops are with
drawn from Mexico, Mexican troops
must be sent to replace them, Gen
eral Bliss, assistant chief of staff of
the United States army, told the
American commissioners here today.
General Bliss put this proposition
squarely before the commissioners
this afternoon at the session held
aboard the President's private yacht,
in a heavy thunderstorm in the Sound.
Luis Cabrera, head of the Mexi
can delegation, replied that he per-'
sonally believed General Carranza
was prepared to send enough troops
to relieve Pershing's force but did not
desire to commit the Mexican gov
ernment, he said, without consulting
the Mexican City officials.
