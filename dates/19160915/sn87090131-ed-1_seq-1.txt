Joseph Thompson Hare.
Joseph Thompson Hare might have
distinguished himself in any one of
halt a dozen honorable professions.
for he had many of the qualities
which command success, but he was
afflicted with Indulgent parents, who
permitted him to run wild in his youth.
I Of a romantic temperament, he was
fond of reading books of adventure,
and the books to which he had access
were not of the character-building
kind. Among them were various
chronicles in which the celebrated
British highwaymen were exploited as
heroes and Joseph grew up with a
'IMP
There Are Thieves on Board All These Boatr ad They Are Looking
for Sudc Men as Yea."
great desire to emulate Turpin, Shep
herd, and the rest of them.
He was born in Chester county,
Pennsylvania, in 1780, and was the
first great American highwayman, as
he probably was the most admirable.
Be was more like Robin Hood than
any gentlemen of the road of whom
there is record, for he was brave, chiv
alrous and generous, and if he stole
from the opulent with one hand, he
gave to the needy with the other. One
cannot read his history without de
ploring the fact that he took the left
hand trail when a lad; had he taken
the other, his bust might now be in
the Hall of Fame.
His first exploit was "plled of"
when he was a schoolboy. He had a
number of cronies of his own age who
had grown up on bandit iitratt re,
and they were all eager for action.
Hare proposed that they rob an old
miserly farmer who lived in the neigh
borhood, and the boys agreed. One
night they went to the farmer's resl
dence, intent on pillage and found
him seated on the front porch, in his
nightrall, the heat having driven him
from the house. The boys waited for
hours, hoping the old man would go
to bed, but he sat there as though
waiting for the end of the world. The
other boys experienced a chill in their
feet, and wanted to go home; but Hare
said he had come forth to rob, and
was going to rob. So he stole quietly
to the porch, and found the farmer
was asleep. Then he entered the
house and rummaged around until he
had found $500, when he rejoined his
companlons.
All his exploits were characteriszed
by a similar daring. As a young man
he went to New Orleans to seek his
fortune. Upon landing there, in his
backwoods ralment, he was ridiculed
by a group of toughs. Hare walked
up to the biggest of the rowdies and
struck him in the face. Then there
was a fight that was talked about in
New Orleans for years. The big rowdy
was Bill Marshall, a celebrated pugil
fat of the time. He was forty pounds
larger than Hare, but the count7y boy
whipped him to a frazzle. Then a pub
lic fight according to ring rules was
arranged for and a tremendous crowd
witnessed the conflict. Hare again
whipped Marshall, and retired from
the ring with a comfortable roll of
money.
Throughout his career he preferred
his fists to firearms. Often he would
depend upon nature's weapons when
his life or liberty was at stake, and
when he had deadly weapons in his
belt. On one oeemaion hb was am
rounded in a tavern by five ofcers,
heavily 'armed, who were bent upon
capturing him, and he whipped the
whole five with his fists and escaped.
The authentic stories of his exploits
would fill a large volume. He same
times had bends a followers, and
sometimes he operated alone, and he
had phenomenal luck.
There was nothing haphazard about
his methods. He laid his plans like a
general, and followed them up. He
had his scouts and spies, and received
accurate Information when wealthy
travelers were about to set forth on
pilgrimages. Then he would ambush
them and relieve them of their val
uables with an old-school courtesy
that must have been highly gratifying
to the victims. His operations cov
ered a wide territory, and he moved
so quickly and mysteriously that it
was almost impossible to locate him.
It was characteristic of this singu
lar man that after every robbery he
was overwhelmed with remorse. He
would repair to some secluded spot
and sit in sackcloth and ashes, and
write poetry full of heartbreak; and
his poetry, considering his meager ed
ucation, is surprisingly good. Several
of his poems have been preserved,
and they are melodious and sweet.
There is not a discordant line in any
of them.
Time and again he made up his
mind to abandon his wicked courses
and lead a quiet and reputable life,
but something always interfered. Upon
one occaq'on. after making of haul of
$5,000-which was a fortune in those
days--he traveled back to the scenes
I of his boyhood, intent upon buying a
farm upon which he had worked as a
child. He had heard that the place
I was for sale, and he was determined
I to own it, and settle down and live
happy ever after. But when he ap
i proached the farmhouse a savage dog
sprang at him from behind some
bushes. and chased him all over the
place, and bit a sample out of his per
son, and he was so mad and disgusted
I that he left the neighborhood at once,
s and resumed his old tricks.
Another time, being well loaded
with money and remorse, he decided
to go to Baltimore and become a mer
chant prince. He made part of the
journey on a steamboat, and was
greatly annoyed by an opulent drover,
who persisted in flashing a big roll of
bills, and boasting of his wealth. Be
fag fall of virtue, Hare took the drov
er aside and advised him to conceal
his money and do less talking. "There
are thieves on board all of these
boats," said Hare, "and they are look
ing for such men as you." The drover
didn't take the advice in good part.
He boasted that he was able to take
care of himself, and he'd like to see
that thief who could despoil him. Here
upon Hare lost all patience with him,
and robbed him of $400, and left the
boat. He was pursued and captured
and served eight years in the peniten
tiary for this little Joke.
s'or many years he purmsed his
course with comparatively few re
verses ; and the reverses usually came
to him because he would not use Are
arms in self-defense. He might have
escaped capture on several occasions
had he been willing to shoot. When
ever he was in custody Hare preached
to his fellow prisoners a good deal,
trying to impress upon them the fact
that the most unprofitable thing in the
world ft a life of crime. "The lot of
the me:nest laborer in the land," said
he, "is a thousand times more enviable
than that of the most successful crim
inal."
Returning to his native state after
seventeen years of wandering and pil
lage, Hare was greatly distressed to
find that his younger brother had
adopted a career of crime, and was
the associate of thieves and gamblers.
This hurt him more than any incident
of his career. With tears on his cheeks
he Implored and entreated the young
man to reform and be good, but in
vain. The youth had no use for the
path of virtue.
"If you must be a criminal, then,"
said Joseph, "come with me, so I can
watch over and protect you." Joseph
had planned to rob the malls, so he
could get enough money to settle down
-he always was going to settle down.
His brother, with other robbers, ac
compeanled him on this errand. They
robbed the coash, but were arrested
at Baltimore a few days later. The
young man drew ten years, and Jo
seph was sentenced to death. He was
executed in September, 1818, and his
last days were given over to the writ.
ing of poetry and the utterance of
mors homilies. He was probably the
only great robber whose hands had
never been stanlaed with human blood.

gests noteworthy events in the history m
of the southern republic, and the con- a
ferences which have been held there a
recently by the representatives of the ci
military forces of both the American I
and Mexican governments add another (
Interesting chapter to the community's tl
annals, says the National Geographic -n
society bulletin. bt
For more than 200 years Juarez was p
known as El Paso del Norte (the pass J
of the North), and it was not until p
188.5 that the city was renamed in hon
or of one of Mexico's greatest states- a
men and patriots, Benito Juarez, who .A
established his capital here during the 9
troublous times when Napoleon lI of a
France was abetting the ill-fated Max- 1
Imillan in his effort to found an em- t
pire in the western hemisphere. t
Juarez, a full-blooded Zanotec Indi- b
an, born in an obscure village near I
Oaxaca. succeeded to the presidency t
of Mexico when Comonfort, weary of I
the internal strife. "quit the job" and
went to the United States, leaving af
fairs in the hands of his chief justice.
Immediately Juarez was embroiled in
civil war by the assumption of the ex
ecutive office by Zuloaga. It was
while trying to displace his rival that
the Indian patriot endeavored to bor
row money from the United States
Iand, as a part of the bargain, he
agreed to a treaty the terms of which
brought forth a storm of protest from
England and France. By this treaty,
which was never ratified, the United
States was to have a perpetual and un
restricted passage across both the
Isthmus of Tehuantepec and the north
ern states of Mexico, and the right to
employ American troops to enforce
these rights as well as to protect
I American citizens against levies and
loans.
Start of Maximillan's Attempt
f A short time later Juarez preepl
tated an international crisis by his de
elsion to suspend for two years the
1 payment of interest on the national
debt. England, Spain and France sent
e fleets to Vera Cruz to force payment,
but England and Spain soon withdrew,
r wlile France, her soldiers once on
Meilcan sol1, decided to press her
'claims, and gradually Napoleon's
scheme for a western empire hN ;.an to
- assume definite form. His scheme
eventuated In the abortive attempt to
e establish Archduke Maximillan of Aus
I tria on the throne of the Montezumal.
It was during the famous defense of
the city of Puebla against the invad
i ing French army that a young Mex
* can soldier, who was to become the
S most conspleaois figure in the history
of modern Mexico, distinguished him
self by his bravery and his exception
i al powers of leadership. This young
hero was Porfirio Diaz, now known to
I fame as "the strong man of Mexico."
. It was in the center of the interna
t tional bridge which connects Juares
P and El Paso that President Taft and
f President Diaz (he who had been
I .Tuarez's military right hand) met in
L 1910. upon the occasion of the cen
tenary celebration of Mexican inde
penlence.
r The traveler who passes through El
Paso on his way to Ju:trez may choose
any of four times by Which to set his
I watch-C--entral. Mountain, Pacific and
Mexican. Mountain time is an hour
slower than Centrnl, while Pacific is
t an hour slower and Mexican is 24
9 minutes faster than Mountain.
Famed for Its Bull Fights.
On account of its bull fights and cock I
fights, Juares has long been a city of
feast-day pilgrimage for Americans in
search of a new sensation. The Span
lards, who became addicted to the bull- I
fight habit in the twelfth century, dur- I
ing the occupation of the Iberian pen- I
insula by the Moors, introduced this I
sport into Mexico shortly after their
overthrow of the Aztecs. The fights
In Juares are not so elaborately staged I
as those in Mexico City, for native
balls are used castomarily, and these
have not the ferocity of the animals
imported by the capital from Andal
nsla at a cost, frequently, of 81,000
(Mexican) each.
On important bull-fight days the
population of Jares tops the 10,000,
Smark, while there is a relative tern
porary decrease in the size of the fifth I
city in Texas. El Parc, which had only
736 people in 1880 but which had
grown to more than 39,000 In 1910.
Nuevo Laredo Is Important.
Another center of Mexican popula
tion along the frontier is Nuevo
Laredo, the border city of Tamaulipas.
It is one of the most important gate
ways to the southern republic, not on
account of its population, for El Paso
and Juares constitute a hyphenated
city more than twice as large as
Laredo (American) and Nuevo Laredo
(Mexican), but because the latter is
the northern terminus of the shortest
railway route to Mexico City, the dis
tance being only about 800 miles, com
pared with 1,200 miles by way of
Juarez and 1,000 miles through Ciudad
Porfirlo Diaz (Eagle Pass).
With 8,000 people, Nuevo Laredo is
a little more than half as large as the
American town at the other end of the
900-foot international bridge which
spans the Rio Grande at this point.
The two towns were one up to the
time of the secession of Texas, the set
tlement on the left bank of the river
being captured by Texas rangers in
1846 and occupied by United States
troops under General Lamar a year
later.
BLOCKADE IS ALWAYS DEFIED
Brave Sailors Have Ever Been Found
Capable of Eluding Any Cordon
of War Vessels.
Blockading and blockade running Is
not a young war measure by any
means, a writer in Munsey's sars. One
of the earliest authentic instances of
the practice dates back two centuries
before the Christian era. Marcus
Claudius Marcellus, commanding a
powerful Roman army and an efficient
fleet, laid siege to Syracuse, a rich city
on the Isle of Sicily. Carthage, Rome's
great rival on the north shore of
Africa, one of the great sea powers
of that time, was not at all pleased
with the idea of Rome capturing Syra
cuse, a free city and probably a source
of great revenue through trade with
Carthage.
Syracuse was a well fortified city,
P and there seemed to be no immediate
I prospect of Rome taking it by storm,
t so Marcellus decided to starve Its in
habitants into submission. He put a
cordon of ships across the entrance to
s the harbor and arrayed his army on
r the land side so that no succor could
a come from without. But he had un
1 derestimated the boldness of the Care
a thaginlans. There was no question eo
a contraband In those days-conditional
or other.
L In their swift, oar-driven galleys the
f sailors of the African city easily
eluded the ships set to watch the port
L and carried provisions, water and war
e material into the beleaguered city. So
F successful were the Carthaginians in
getting supplies into the city, running
the blockade--that had it not fallen
r through treachery it would have been
o enabled to hold out indefinitely. While
blockades probably had been estab
- lished before on a small scale the.
a blockade of Syracuse Is one of the
I earliest Instances where the efficiency
d of a blockade by sea was of vital im
I portance nla determining the success of
war on an important seaport.
