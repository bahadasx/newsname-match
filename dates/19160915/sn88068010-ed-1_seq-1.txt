Tab City Will Have a RaUroad
Soon, -New Santa Fe Route
Has Been Established '-:
, ; It now appears a fixed fact that
. this' city will be a big spot on the
1 map for other reasons than being
the .capital of the county, and
will have one of the greatest rail
roads in the country or any where
else run through the city instead
of out of walking distance.
- For years the. Burlington has
desired to reach Kansas City by
a more direct route, and the
- Santa Fe also wished to get into
' St Louis without having to go
" all over the state to do so. -
.The Burlington for years has
. had a road from St Louis to
Mexico and the Santa Fe one
: from Carrollton to Kansas City,
By reaching Mexico from Carroll-
ton the Santa Fe would have
her problem solved, and by reach
ing Carrollton from Mexico the
Burlington would have a direct
road to Kansas City, each road
using the track of the other from
the points named.
- Three or four years ago the
Burlington began making sur
veysfrom Carrollton t Mexico
and several lines were run, one
of them between the Wabash
and the Chariton river, south of
' town, and another just at the
- northern limits of this city. Each
of those surveys was through
Brunswick and thence in a south
, easterly direction except the one
which passed through this city.
The action of the Missouri river
during these years appears to
have decided the engineers to
get as far: away from the low
r bottoms -as Jpossible,and''rthe
route over the hills has been
. adopted. The Santa Fe may have
been in with the Burlington all
the time, but if so it was not
very extensively known, for only
in the past few weeks has it
leaked out positively that the
Santa Fe intended to get into
the metropolis of the west
Whether the roads will use the
. Santa Fe tracks from Carrollton
to Whitbam, then build to Brans
' wick, running through the Judge
-. Herring property on the north
side of the city, thence to this
burg, passing through the W. E
Hill property and southeasterly
to the old Shannon tarm near
Shannondale and on to Mexico,
is not generally known; but this
appears to be the settled direc
tion, unless, from Carrollton to
Brunswick, the new road shall be
built south of the Santa Fe
. track at Whitham.
The road will be . a double
' track from the start, and if this
city is not the logical point for
the division, then Brudswick will
be; but, whether we get the di-
vision or not at the start, it will
, be satisfactory that , the road
run through with other arrange
ments for a few years. J t;
The fact th Santa Fe has be
gun construction of a fifty -thou
sand dollar station it. Carrollton
s is significant, and the mutual in
terests of the two roads in their
; objective points, or, if their in
terests:, be not, mutual in St
J Loujv Jt is a long' known i f act
that! poth roads have wanted and
' intended to have a direct hue
. V from Kansas City to Si Louis,
and' as both roads generally get
what they want we are more
than glad that we are in the
way of their going. Let us
- VLook! Lookl" for "they are
coming thts way." 'J -v-y
- v It is worth while to say that
" we will lend every encourage
"' ment in our power to have the
road built anywhere through the
town that its builders wish to
run. ;y.Yy; yr
Wa Hamilton of Brunswick
was'a caller Friday afternoon.'
The big picnic ' advertised by
the Modern Woodmen of Ameri
ca for last Saturday was! pulled
off in a most successful manner.
The prograrii furnished splendid
entertainment and the speaker
of the day, Dr. V Hill v of ' New
York, sent out by the Republican
Committee, being about the first
republican orator ever heard in
that section, was fairly well re
ceived. John D. Taylor also
spoke. The music was furnished
by a medicine show band and
was good, considering the num
ber of instruments.
Amusement stands and re
freshments kept the large crowd
f rom'getting weary, and the day
was highly enjoyed by all who
attended. . Best of order was
maintained and considering the
very short notice of the event it
was a success. Ad Embree cap
tured the premium offered for
the ugliest man, Franklin Carter
for the best looking man, Will
iam Smith's baby for the pretti
est baby, Dick Wright won foot
race, Musselfork team won tug
of war against Mike and Ham
den, Marvin Jay won sack race.
Two or three rings did not fill.
Killed by Train
A. E. Crisman, employed at
Brunswick as watchman of en
gines etc. in the Wabash yards
at Brunswick, was . struck by a
C. & A. train Wednesday. He
had crawled from under an en
gine on the siding and was look
ing the other way when a C & A
train which was pulling in struck
him and knocked him under the
engine from under which be had
emerged. v-. .:y -: ;
v- II.was-roshed to the hospital
at-Moberlr and tho no bones
were found to be broken, he
was considered badly injured.
He died Wednesday night.
Birthday Party
Miss Anna Blair Miller, when
she was six years old, was prom
ised the chance to properly cele
brate her twelfth birthday, and
Tuesday evening she assembled
about forty of her juvenile
friends and the time they had
from seven to eleven that even
ing could not have been better.
. Kumps, games, tnen some
more romps, a fine luncheon then
some more and greater romping,
music, songs and the best time.
Of course the revelers had to be
shooed away or daylight would
have found them still having a
good time.

PAEER MCMMBING
Old piper of any kind is now worth
nearly as much as new print .a few
months ago, and rags areas profitable
as war munitions, j
It takes all we get from delinquent
subscribers to payi for the paper we

must advanee the cash. Thats hardly
fair, is it? Think ofj it, you who owe us.
Big Crowd to Carrollton , . j
'The Birth of a Nation" at-1
traded a large number of our
citizens to Carrollton Friday and
Saturday evenings last ,week,
and among the number , were,
those who had not been tempted
out of the city for years for any
thing of the kind. Harshbarger
of Carrollton was on the train
Friday afternoon and declared
he felt that a wreck was un
avoidable when he saw W, D.
Vaughan aboard bound for the
show. Never mind about that
irrepressible Harsh, Mr. Vaughan
declares that he has not enjoyed
anything so much in a long
time and it is pretty certain that
if that wonderful production
comes very near this burg again
he will see it again.
.We note the following who
were among the number attract
edbythe true-to-life production
of scenes with which so many
were familiar a few years ago.

Convicts Incendiary?
Within the past six weeks
three destructive fires have oc
curred in the State Penitentiary
and hundreds of thousands of
dollars' worth of property has
been destroyed.
A convict who had just finish
ed his term was in the office of
the Kansas City Star telling a
reporter that there would be a
number of fires in the pen, and
while he was talking the first fire
was burning.
Just what the origin of the
fires is not known at this time,
but in spite of all the precau
tions one fire has followed an
other until it appears that every
thing inside of the walls will be
destroyed unless a speedy Check
is found. " ' ' '
Warden McClung is not in the
least popular on account of his
disciplinary methods with the
convicts, and it is believed that
he will, be assassinated , if , some
of the convicts, get a chance to
kill him. .' -,;

Old Citizen Sells Farm
Reared from early manhood in
this community, marrying Char
iton county girls and rearing his
family here, working hard and
prospering as a farmer and
stock raiser, K. D. Vincent con
cluded last week that he had
earned a rest and since it could
not be realized for himself and
wife so long as they remained
on their laree farm north of
town, the best thing to do was to
dispose of it and they did so.
They acquired in the deal for the
farm some fine income property
m jxausaa iny ana so soon as
they can close up their business
affairs here they will move to
that city and perhaps engage in
some business which will not be
so exacting as farming.
' Mr. Vincent will have a sale
of his stock and other farm
Property in the near future of
which he will give ample notice.
It will be with great regret that
the entire community .will wit
ness the departure of the popu-
m ' -
iar nonprogressive - family-yet
feel, that after so many years
spent in close attention to their
work, they are entitled to enjoy
the fruits of their labor in their
own chosen way.
