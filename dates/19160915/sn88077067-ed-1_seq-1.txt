After a lengthy and severe examin
ation by Prosecutor Myers Wednes
day evening, she admitted the theft,
so It is stated, but said she had dis
posed of the Jewelery. No Informa

the city. Upon his return he will be
compelled to offer more satisfactory
security.

GAS OFFICE
Robbed Once More Looks Like
Same Parties Might IJave
Pulled Off Stunt.
For the second time within two
onths the safe at the office of the
Celina Gas company, was opened and
obbed of its contents again last Fri
day night, and about $65 in checks
and cash stolen.
The combination on the safe hadn't
been changed since the previous rob
bery and undoubtedly the same par
ty and no doubt local talent, pulled
off the job.
Both robberies have come during
gas collection time, but very strange
to say the thief at both times pulled
the job only a day or so before the
tenth of the month. Had he waited
until the following night, a good haul
could have been made.
Entrance was gained by prying op
en a window at the rear of the room.
The first time the place was robbed,
only money was taken, but this time
the robbers pried out the money box
and took it and contents both.

Touching the Schools.
The local public schools opened
very auspiciously last Monday morn
ing, after a week's delay, owing to
Improvemnets being niade on the
Kust building.
The enrollment this year only ex
ceeds that of last year by 14 pupils,
but lust year's gain was exceptional
iy targe over tue previous yoar. The
Prof. Pogue and his efficient corps
f. . , j in - . ,
teachers feel very Jubilant over the
opening enrollmut and the unusual
Interest manifested and feel the
school year is going to be a most pro-
titablo one
uiaoio one.
In furnishing us with the enroll-
ment on Wednesday Prof. Pogue re
luested that we call attention to the
even division of pupils in the differ
ent grades of both buildings this year
which Is made possible under the new
division of the town for school atten
dance as made by the Board this year.
Unfortunately the East building Is
located very poorly. The center of
population of the town has been grad
ually drifting westward, until the
West building grades became over
crowded, and the Board deemed It
advisable to redistrict the town
changing the dividing line from Main
street to Walnut street, and iuclud
ing all pupils n;rth of Wayne street
in the hast district.

A CORRECTION
VVj. C. Dick, member of local board
of education, has called our attention
to a couple of matters in connection
with local school conditions that be
feels were slightly misrepresented by
The Democrat, week before last in
commenting upon school expenses
and budget askings of the local
board. 1 .
"As to the salary paid Supt.
Pogue," said Mr. Dick, "I believe the
people have the impression that we
v,, ,u ..
nav him 9in(l a vpar wnlla That Ifl
uoi me case. e iniijr wuiiu mai.
salary, but we could not pay him such
an amount. The local board pays
him but $1080, and he receives the
balance as district superintendent of
tbe schools in Celina, Jefferson town
ship, and Maple Center special in
Center township. Again the item of
$3,000, instead of $4,000, and the
expense of improving the East bulld-
ng was only $5,000 Instead of $6,-
000.
'You also failed to mention in your
article," said Mr. Dick, "that we pay
out of the school funds each year the
sum Of $1200 for the support of the
Public T.lhrarv. one of nnr largest
single items of expense." I
We had no intention of misrepre-
senting conditions ortt criticizing the
Board or the head of the scnoots, and
gladly give the above information.
"Big Pete" says that some time in
October Kelleys Bros, will advertise
all of his book accounts and notes
for sale to the highest bidder. Watch
the papers if you want to buy book
accounts or notes as they will all be
sold to the highest bidder. I
The Center W. C. T. U. will hold
a rally meeting at the Outer church,
Sunday evening, September 17th. A
good program of songs, recitations.
and readings will be given. We want
to make thin an every member pres
ent meeting, and hope that every
member will plan to come. All oth
ers interested In temperance worn
are also invited.

Despite the fact that Ada Is less
than a score of miles away from Li
ma, the invitation extended by Presi
dent A. E. Smith, of the Ohio North
trn University to the members of the
West Ohio Conference to be their
guests next year was enthusiastically
accepted. It was so cordial and the
university was painted In such allur
ing colors that they could do no less.
To be told that they could have all
orts of good things to eat for ten
cents was an item in these days of
high cost of living. To be promised
that session would be held within the
walls of their new $100,000 building

of any one. preacher or committee
worker and all things of the sort were
inducements. President Smith also
promised that all the Presbyterians,
Baptists, Christians and every other
denomination in the city would ex
tend the glad hand to the visitors as
well as all the teaching and student
body.
