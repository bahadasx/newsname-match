LONDON, Sept. 15.—Two of the
greatest battles fought in JSurope in
several weeks are now raging along
the Somme front in northern Prance
and along a seventy-five mile line in
northern Greece.
Allied war offices this afternoon
announced striking victories In both
encounters.
British troops pushed out in a great
blow north of the Somme this morn
ing, advancing more than 2,000 yards
on a front of about eix miles. General
Haig reported to the war office. The
struggle. is continuing and already a
large number of' German prisoners
have been -brought in.
A few hours before this advance on
the British right wing and center be
gan, the British left wing struck last
night southeast of Thlepval. German
trenches were captured on a front of
1,000 yards including the strongly
defended "wundenvork." At about
the same time the French advanced to
the edge of the village of Ranoourt,
fun\eT* tightening the Anglo-French
noose about the important town of
Combles.
In the Balleans, the greatest gains
since the allied offensive began were
announced in an official bulletin is
sued at Paris. The Serbians have
driven the Bulgarians back ten miles
on the allied left wing, capituring two
villages and the 'principal parts of
the heights of Malkanldje. The French
war office further announced the
capture of Matchoukevo village and
two heights to the north by the Brit
ish and the capture of nearly a mile
of Bulgarian trenches to a depth of
six hundred yards by the French. The
German war office for the first time
since tJie allies took the offensive in
Macedonia, admitted allied successes
this afternoon. Berlin announced that
the Serbs have captured the Malkan

NEW YORK, Sept. 15—morgan.
Rockefeller ind Dupont groups of
financiers have reaped mlllons in in
creased valuation of their holdings in
the present boom in the stock ex
change, according to estimates in
Wall street today. Steel, oil and
motor stocks have been leaders in
the wild rush of speculation which
recorded one million share day after
another and sent priceB to new high
records on many. successive days.
The boom started in the "Morgan
group" and it is common talk on the
street that a bullish sentiment was
desired in order to facilitate the flota
tion of the recent British loan. As
the upward movement was getting
well under way, Maihe election re
turns were injected into the situation
and a price vement followed, de
scribed as similar to the boom which
started when first returns indicated
McKinley's election in 1896.
United States Steel climbed to a
record at 107 a share, a figure which
was duplicated today General Motors
shot upwards at a fifty., dollar a day
rate to $750 a share and was but
slightly under that figure today. On
the curb the various Standard Oil
stocks have been successfully main
tained, Standard Oil of Indiana, and
Prairie Gas and Oil selling up nearly
100 points during the course of the
movements. These groups represent
in order the interests of Morgan, Du
pont and Rockefeller.

United states Steel, form the two
greatest mergers ever made in this
country has been another of the
leaders In tha present movement,
common selling from fifty cents to
$50.75 and preferred $3 to $125.25 in
little more than a year.
Identified with Dupont interests are
two other groups known as the Kauff
mann and the Chatham-Phoenix bank
group. General Motor, Chevrolet
Motors and United Motors by their
advances, hare enriched these men
by millions. Almost unnoticed Gen
eral Motors new stock appeared on

did not even hesitate for an instant.
