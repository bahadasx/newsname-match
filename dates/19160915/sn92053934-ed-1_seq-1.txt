Politicians
watched the Barr-Brun-
dage and Mason-Chiperfield contests
; with close interest. In the former the
Joliot man failed to maintain his ratio I
j of pains established yesterday, al- j
though with 4ti4 downstate precincts
j yet to iioar irnm his plurality outside.
! took county was 40. l a. It was cal-
ciliated that he would come up to the
county line wnii a lead of approxi
mately 47.500. thus failing by a narrow
margin to wipe out Edward J. Bruu
dage's lea.l here of 48.307.
Mason's strength downstate was suf
ficient to keep him within about 10.000
votes of Burnett M. C'hipcrfteld of Can
ton, ami thus, in the opinion of experts,
insures him the place as running mate
of Medill McCormick for national rep
resentative at large. The former sen
ator led the Canton man by approxi
mately 27. K00 In Cook county.

tdiow enough strength to overcome the

BURNING SHIP If

Liner Congress Landed Fassenrers
Safely Total Loss Is $2,100,000
at I.eaf.
Marrdifiebl. Ore., Sept. 15. -The Pa
cific Coast Steamship company's liner
Congress swung on her anchor chain
at. the entrance to Coos bav today, a
of the tire whic h caused her to race for
this port last night. Every one of the
25: passengers on Ivoard and tiio crew
of 175 were landed safely last night by
tho dredge Colonel J. S. Michie.
Order was maintained on board up
until the departure of the last boat load
from the Congress to the Michie, which
came alongside when the burning ves
sel was enveloped in a pall of smoke.
Many were in the state room when
passengers were summoned on deck
by the fire alarm. A passenger named
Minder could not escape through the
door of the cabin on account of the
smoke. He had to be pulled through a
12-inch port hole.
Purser Molzer said he was unable to
bring the valuables out of the ship's
safe. There was ? 10,000 of tho com
pany's money on board, and the crew
was to be paid today.
The skill with which Captain Cousins
brought his vessel to anchor off a
strange harbor was enlarged upon here
today by marine men. Until the last lie
hoped to save the ship. The captain,
crew and passengers fought the flames j
until the captain realized that nothing1
more could be done and ordered tbe j
vessel to be abandoned.
All tiie ship's papers and valuables,
it was confirmed today, were burned.
These valuables, estimated as worth
$50,000, together with the ship's cargo,
estimated at a value of about an equal
amount, probably will bring the total
loss to $2,100,000.

HELD IN SWEDEN
Clever Scheme to Roh Seventeen Amer
ican Banks Is Discovered Just
In Time.
Chicago, Sept. 15. Details of what, is
saiil to have been an elaborate plot to
swindle 17 banks in the United States
out of an amount estimated at. betw-een
$300,000 and $500,000 were made pub
lic here today. At the same time it
!was announced that a detective would
leave Chicago for Gottenburg, Sweden,
armed with extradition papers for Karl
von Bardi. wanted in connection with
the alleged plot. Yon Bardi, according
to the Swedish consul hero, was cap
tured by a wireless message on a
charge of having forged checks for
$3,000 in the name of a local varnish
manufacturing company.
According to the police, Von Bardi
assumed in Chicago the name of a
French count. Here and in other
American cities he worked for five
years in one bank after a. other, famil
iarizing himself, it is said, with the
bank officials' signatures and gather
ing a supply of stationery and blank
forms.
Soon after his arrival and arrest in
Sweden, banks in Chicago and other
cities received inquiries from Swedish
banking institutions as to th.3 wherea
bouts of one ICnut Bagge. Letters cf
credit in his favor, it was said, had not
been cashed.
American hankers found that no let
ters of credit had been issued to
Hagge. It developed that 17 Swedish
banks were holding letters of credit
from ns many American institutions
depositing to the account of Knut
Bagge amounts varying from 35,500 to
150,000 kronen.

in dealing with a submarine) of th
allies, because they have no commer
cial submarines." The note deals
with a number of questions relative
to navigation, and concludes:
"Tho attitude adopted by the Swed
ish government is at variance in ob
vious respects with an attitude which
Is compatible with the duties of a
loyal and impartial neutral."
Great Britain and Sweden have been
at odds since the early period of th
war, and Sweden's unyielding attitude
evidently has resulted in a decision to
exert the. combined pressure of all th
entente allies on her. Difficulties aros
from tho allied blockade of Germanv,
resulting in the holding up of goods
enroute to Sweden which were sus
pected to b destined for Germany.
Sweden retaliated by holding up large
quantities of parcel post matter In
transit between England and Russia.
This led to an exchange of notes
which accomplished nothing, and ear
ly this month a deadlock was reached.
Great Britain insisted, as a condition
to submitting the dispute to arbitra
tion, that Sweden must promise not.
to interfere again with English mail
matter. Sweden declined, and the
Swedish minister at London went to
the continent, to lie gone for several
weeks. Negotiations were transferred
to Stockholm, but the latest advices
from London wero that no solution of
the problem was In sight.

views either in a speech at Shadow
Lawn or in a letter.
Mr. Wilson expects to make clea.
