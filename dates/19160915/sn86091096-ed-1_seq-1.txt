Rev. H. B. Emmel of Peck
Given Kendrick Charge
At the annual meeting of the
Columbia River Conference of the
Methodist Church held at Lewiston
last week, Rev. J. J. Matney, pas
tor of the Kendrick circuit, was
transferred to Anatone, Wash., and
the Rev. H. B. Emmel has been
assigned to the work here. Rev.
Matney's transfer came as a sur
prise to his many friends in this
community, but of course in Meth
odist circles it is not at all unusual
for a good man to be given a new
charge at any annual conference of
the church. Rev. Matney who has so
faithfully endeavored to promote
the spiritual and material welfare
of the church and community, ex
pects to leave shortly witn his fam
ily for his new appointment.
While regretting his departure, we
cannot but wish him well and
bespeak for him the hearty co-oper
ation of the Christian people of
Anatone.
Rev. H. B. Emmel, the new pas
tor, was in Kendrick Wednesday
looking over the field and made a
very favorable impression. He
comefe highly recommended from
the Peck church where he has been
pastor for the past two years. Not
only is he referred to as a strong
pastor and preacher, but also as an
accomplished musician and leader
amoung young people. Let the
good people of all denominations
give Rev. Emmel a hearty and cor
dial welcome to Kendrick.

m
^ Caught in an unusually heavy ground swell, the United States armored cruiser Memphis, flag
ship of Rear Admiral Charles F. Pond, commander of the cruiser squadron, was driven ashore on the
rocks off Santo Domingo. It is reported that more than twenty lives were lost. The inrush of water
when the Memphis struck extinguished the fires under her boilers. The Memphis is commanded by
Captain E. L. Beach. She was formerly the Tennessee. The harbor where she struck has always
been a treacherous one because of the sudden danger without warning. Her commander reoorts that
she will be a total loss. —

House Burned
The home of Ira Gentry was tot
ally destroyed by fire Wednesday
morning. Mr. Gentry got up 3:30
Wednesday morning and started
the fire to prepare the morning
meal. Hearing the dogs barking
on the hill went to see what the
trouble was. Returning half an hour
later he found his house in flames.
He rushed into the house and got
his wife and family out, but could
not save any of the contents.
Everything excepting the clothes
they had on were burned.
Hurt In Ruuaway
While returning home Saturday
afternoon J. W. Organ and wife
met with a serious accident. They
were driving a team of colts and
when about to cross ' the N, P.
track at the lower end of town the
colts became frightened at the ap
proach of the local yard engine,
which Mrs. Organ states, gave no
alarm when nearing the crossing,
the team swung round and in do
ing so upset the buggy throwing
them from their seat. Mr. Organ
received serious internal injuries
while Mrs. Organ escaped with
only a few bruises. Before the team
was stopped the buggy was com
pletely wrecked. Dr. Hoyt was
called and had Mr. Organ taken to
his home where he is still confined
to his bed.
Knitting Plant For Bovill
!
Industrial interests in Bovill have
been boosted by the establishment
by James Campbell of a knitting
plant, up-to-date machinery for
which has been installed in a cojn
modious steel and concrete build
ing. The plant will represent an
investment of upward of $25,000,
and at the present time will give
employment to forty women and
girls. The product of the factory
will be heavy woolen underwear,
sweaters and stockings, and it has
already booked many orders for
these goods. Mr. Campbell's plans
include the spinning of his own
yam. He is generating his own
light and power by stearv, and is
negotiating with the authorities to
light the town.
Bovill citizens are properly jubi
lant over securing this very impor
tant industry. It means much not
only for Bovill, but for the entire
Upper Potlatch section and the
lumbering regions of central Idaho
generally.

ELLINGTON QUITS
.......
a
As Head of Dairy Division
in Agricultural College
Announcement was made today
that E. V. Ellington, for six years
associated with the agricultural col
ege, has resigned to accept an ap
pointment as assistant chief of the
western dairy division of the United
States agriculture department with
headquarters at Salt Lake and he
will assume his new duties on Octo
ber 1. Mr. Ellington has been a
familiar figure among dairy enthu
siasts in Idaho and there will be re
gret that he is leaving Idaho. He
will work in the 14 western states.
Mr. Ellington is a graduate of
the University of Missouri and came
directly to Idaho. Prior to his
three year's service with the uni
versity as head of the dairy depart
ment he was engaged in field work
for the agricultural college for
three years. When he came to
Idaho there was no dairy herd, but
under his able direction the dairy
herd was organized and now Idaho
is recognized as having the finest
dairy herd of any college in the
west.
"I have many friends in Moscow
and throughout the state and regret
leaving Idaho, but I could not re
ject the splendid promotion that is
tendered me bv the government,"
said Mr. Ellington today.
Highway Meeting in October
a
Decision has been reached by
President L. J. Perkins of the North
and South State Highway Associa
tion to hold a meeting of the asso
ciation in early October instead of
September 20. The definite date
of the meeting will be decided
within a few days. Decision was
reached to hold the meeting at the
later date for the reason that it is
assured all the various counties in
terested can send representatives at
that time and it has also been
learned that the attendance of sev
eral state officers will be possible in
October, whereas present appoint
ments would make it impossible for
them to be here at the earlier date.
In the meantime the association
is completing its organization and
yesterday Secretary Adam sent out
letters having in view the comple
tion of local organizations in Koot
enai, Benewah, Boundary, Shoshone
and Bonner counties throngh the
appointment of vice presidents and
advisory boards. The following
counties have already organized
these adjuncts of the general asso
ciation: Nez Perce, Lewis, Latah,
Clearwater, Idaho, Adams, Wash
ington, Canyon and Ada. In all
these counties marked interest in
the movement is being displayed
and it is assured all will send rep
resentatives to the Lewiston meet
ing, when definite policies are to be
decided upon as the future work of
the association.

j
a
A week or so ago the Kendrick
Auto Co. received a carload of
Overland cars, of the new type 35

other agent in this section of the
country.
