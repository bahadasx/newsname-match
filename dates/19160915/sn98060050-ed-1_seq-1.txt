PAGE ENDORSED.
Senntor Carroll S. Pago of Ilydo
Park bns pood reason to bo proud of
the endorsement which tho people of
Vermont, in their first primary Tues
day, nave him in his campaign for
(mother term in thc'United States sen
ate. To win over ex-Oov. Allen M.
Fletcher, who conducted n hot cam
paign, by K!,()00 or more votes, nnd
over Mr. Fletcher nnd Gov. C. W.
Gates together by approximately G,000
votes, was n remarkable showing. Mr.
Gates was an active candidato only to
the extent thnt he sanctioned the use
of hi3 name.
There is only one answer to the re
sult the people of the state preferred
Page to either of tho other candidates.
It is true that the men active in poli
tics the ones who steer campaigns and
exert influence wero largely with
Page, but this statement doe3 not
wholly explain his overwhelming vic
tory. Most of us believed that Page
would win, but his most ardent sup
porters made 110 predictions that his
majority would reach tho big figures
Tovealcd by actual count of tho ballots.
The Phoenix supported Mr. Fletcher,
believing him to bo a man of great
ability, but the words nbility and pop
ularity aro not always coupled togeth
er. Fletcher and Pago spent d lot of
money in the enmpnign. nnd exchanged
hot shot at about every opportunity.
Mr. Ontes maintained his dignity and
good temper all the time, nnd as the
Barro Times aptly says he "emerges
from tho contest without I093 of pres
tige or money."
The nomination of Senator Page is
equivalent to an election and in addi
tion to the term which will not be
completed until March 1, 1917, he will
go bade to Washington for a full term
of six years. If he lives to complete
tho term ho will bo 80 years old at its
expiration, and probably ho will expect
to retire to private life at that ago.
There) already aro signs that in 1022
there will be a race with several en
trants to secure his seat.
The Phoenix accepts the judgment
of the people cheerfully and with pride
is counted among the minority.
IN WINDHAM COUNTY.
The primary produced one result
which would never have taken placo
under the old convention of mnking
nominations. For yoars it has been
tho custom to nominnto one senator
from each probnto district. Under tho
now law the nominations go to tha two
men havinR tho most votes on the pri
mary ballots. Mr. DoWitt of Xcwfnno
received the largest vote, with Mr.
Kddy of llrattleboro second. They be
come tho regular nominees, although
both nre residents of tho Marlboro dis
trict, Mr. Ware of Townshend nnd
Mr. Divoll of Rockingham, both
beaten, aro residents of the Rocking
ham district. Tho southern part of tho
county also gets tho sheriff and stifto's
attorney, leaving the northern district
with only two names to go on tho of
ficial ballot "Warner R. Graham of
Rockingham for judge of probato in tho
Rockingham district and E, L. Has
tings of Townshend for assistant judgo
of the county court. This result was
brought about by the provisions of tho
primnry law nnd not by a desire of
tho voters of thn southern district to
"hog" tho olltces.
The surprising fact about tho first
trial of tho primary in Vermont was
tho largo voto east. Tho showing of
Vermont was in striking coutrnst to
tho uso of tho primary in Now Ilamp
shire. In round numbers -15,000 vntcs
wero cast. Tho primary is not a politl-
cal panacea by any menus, but Vcr
mouters eertnlnly have shown their in
tcrost in its operation. Tho law is in
tho experimental stago at this timo, but
it should have a full nnd fair trial.
Any attempt to east tho law ovorboard
i tho noxt legislature ought to bo vlgo
1 rously opposed.
COUNTY COURT BEGINS.
Dockot Oloarcd of Numerous Oases Yes
terday Demurrer Argued in Power
Co. Against Brown.
Tho September term of the Wind
ham county court, which was formally
opened lucsday nnd then adjourned to
yesterday because of the state primaries
iitesuay, began business yesterday
morning soon after i) o'clock, after
Rev. U. W. Mock of Nnwfn nn liml of
fered prayer. Juduc Leiuhtnn P.
Slack is the presiding judge, with F.
B. Pier and E. L. Hastinus assistant
judges, nttorneys from out of the coun
ty who were present, besides most of
the membership of the Windham coun
ty bar, were Homer Skeoles of Ludlow,
P. G. Bicknell of Chester and Robert
Simonds of St. Johnsbury.
Tho following cases were marked as
settled and discontinued: A. W. Gray's
Sons against Oeorgo R. and Guste m
Goodcnough; Eugene P. Bigelow
against Charles E. Bacon; Olo Anton
sen against William A. Starrett; Man-
icy uros. against tho Boston & Maine

Galvin, apt.; Edward L. Walker
against Elliott G. White.
attorney P. G. Barber reprcsentinc
Wilson I. Brown, and Attornev Harold
E. Whitney for tho Connecticut River
1'owcr Co., nrgued a demurrer. The
original ease is an effort on tho part
of Mr. Brown to collect from the pow
er company pay for the uso of a right
of way for tho greater part of a yenr,
the planum claiming that a contract
witli tho power company called for
the uso of the road for the rest of the
year of 1915 at a weekly charge for its
use.
The power company had demurred.
seeking to have tho action taken to
tho court of chancery. Mr. Whitney
claimed that thoro wns no other ques
tion in the case except tho construc
tion of the contract nnd he nsked that
tho court placo a construction upon
tho contract.
.Mr. Barber argued lor a common
law trial by jury, declaring that there
was no ground for tho transfer of tho
case to a court of equity. Judge Slack
reserved decision.
It is oxpected that this will bo a
short term of court.
Not much was done in tho afternoon
When it wns found that for various
reasons the ease" of Lottio E. Doylo
against tho E. A.- Strout Farm ngoney
and others could not go on tomorrow
nnd no other jury cases were ready,
the jurors wero excused until AIon(Ia3
afternoon. It is expected that tho case
of Dr. B. F. Millington of South Lon
donderry against Collins R. Griswold of
Londonderry, an action of deceit alleged
to have taken placo over the transfer
of a piece of real estate, will be the
first to bo heard by a jury.
The court will be rendv today and to
morrow to hear court cases and it is
honed to dispose of several of them be
fore Monday afternoon.
Rev. Paul D. Moody, pastor of the
South Congregational church in St.
.Tohnshury, has been appointed by Gov.
Gates to succeed President Thomas ot
Middlcburv college, resigned, as chap
lain of the First Vermont regiment at
Eagle Pass, Texas. He has been granted
a three months' leave of absence from
his ehureh and will take, up the duties
of his position as soon as possible. Rev.
Mr. Moody is the younger son of tho
lato Dwight I.. Moody, the famous
evangelist, who established Xorthfield
seminary and tho Mount Hermon school
for boys. He lu.pf tho highest charac
ter, with a pleasing personality, and
will undoulitedlv endear himself to tho
soldier boys and bo of great help to
them in camp hundreds of miles from
homo.
Maine spoke in no uncertain terms
Monday. The Republicans elected a gov
ernor, two United States senators and
four representatives in congress. It
was a clean sweep with tho majority
for the state around the 14,000 mark.
The Democrats have held control of tho
state the last four years, and like the
Republicans they were asseverating
that it was the barometer state. "As
goes Maine so goes the nation," has
been the claim. If this be truo tho
Democrats can already see the hand
writing on the wnll. Tho encouraging
fact from tho Republican standpoint is
that a very large part of tho men en
rolled in tho Progressive movement
four and two years ago eamo back in
to the fold of tho party with which
they wore formerly nlllliated.
Maine, tho barometer state, gave tho
administration and Democrats generally
a jar Monday, tho Republicans making
a cIoimi sweep, electing u governor, two
United Stntes senators and four repre
sentatives in congress. Tho pluralities
ranged from closo to 14,000 to 11,000
where tho whole stilto was Involved,
nnd by eomfortablo margins in tho
congressional districts. A Democratic
govornor, senntor and ono representa
tive in congress will bo replaced by Re
publicans. Tho encouraging featuro
from a nntlonal viewpoint is that a big"
percentage of Progressives came Imck
Into the Republican fold.
