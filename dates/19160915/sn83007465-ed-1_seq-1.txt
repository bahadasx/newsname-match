Washington, Sept. 1L'.?Violation 1

There has been more than one,
complaint about the activity of the 1
British vessel around the Philip- 8
pines and while Oov. (Jen. Harrison's j
leport furnishes the basis for a spe^s
rifle protest, it is probable that Ureat v
Britain will be called upon to restrict
the operations of her patrol- ?
ling squadron generall in and near {
the territorial waters of the islands.'
In order that there might be no .
o
mistake about where the Cebu wasj
at the time she was held up. her exa

as follows: Latitude 14 degrees, IK
minutes: longitude, 120 degrees, 3t'>

Columbia, Sept. 12.?Standing on
tie State house steps at 11 o'clock
ast night, Gov. Manning pledged
imself to again enfoce the laws of!
lie State and urged the healing of;
actional breaches. The governor!
'dressed several thousand person!
tter his election had been assured. I
Tactically all of the throng which!
,as watching the election return-1
ashed by The State, deserted the|
treet to hear the address by the!
overnor. Several thousand voteis!
aarched to the State house, headed
y a band, and called upon Gov.
tanning to deliver, the address.
The governor declared, that the
ccple of the State must bury fac-l
ional differences and live in a
pint of brotherhood for the common j
ood. He said that the constitution
sust he upheld and that he would,
ontinue his policy of enforcing,|
airly, all of the .aws of the State, j
Gov. Manning spent the evening!

from the election. He receiv-;
d many callers during the evening.!
mluding a large number of wo-,
aen and children.
At 11 o'clock last night Gov. Man-,
ing sent the following telegram to |

Gov. Manning in his address from
he State house steps said:
"The returns indicate a victory for
he constitution and law. At such a
ime a sense of profound gratitude to
Llmighty God fills our hearts. 1 have
lever seen a time when the people
f South Carolina were more stirred
ver an election. It is a victory of
he people in support of the constintion
and the enforcement of law.
t shows that when the people realze
their duty and when a real dan;er,
a crisis, confronts thetn. they
neet it as true patriots and settle it
right. Splendid work has been done
>y the citizens and their work has
>een rewarded by success. If this
ictory is assured, and I believe it is
ssured, we must see that bitterness
nd strife are subdued and allayed
,nd that we must all as citizens of
me State and as brethren in a comnon
cause unite in tne great work of
ipbuilding our State and in making
ugher and better the character of
mr citizens.
"I consecrate myself anew to this
creat work and pledge myself to
our service."

GOVERNOR HARRIS
I IS SNOWED UNDER
SEVERAL CLOSE RACES
Brown and Price Kuri Close for
Commissioner of Agriculture.
Con. Hughes Defeated.
Atlanta, Sept. 13.?Hugh M. Dorsey
will go into the Democratic convention
at Macon September 2ti
with a big majority of votes pledged
to him for governor as a result of
the State primary yesterday. While
returns today still are incomplete
figures at hand give Dorsev 107
counties, with a convention vote of
260; Governor Nat E. Harris, 3 7
counties, with a convention vote of
08; Dr. L. G. Hardman, four counties.
with 10 delegates, and Josephs
E. Pottle three counties, with a half
dozen delegates also. A majority in
the convention will be 10 2 votes. Tho
difference in the popular vote for
Dorsev and Harris was not great ij
proportion to the delegates gained,
that being due to Harris running a
close second in some of the counties
to which the greater number of delegates
are allotted.
Several Hares Close.
Apparently all State house officers
with exception of Governor Harris
are confident they will he returned,
elthdigh the race oetween W. J.
Fpeer, treasurer, and his opponent.
W. J. Makes, is close and later returns
could put Eakes in the lead.
J. J Brown, opposing J. D. Price
for commissioner of agriculture, also
is running close and victory will rest,
with tho aspirant claiming the majority
of the vote yet to be heard
from. If the present ratio is maintained
Price will win.
M. L. Brittain state school superintendent.
has a safe lead over Alexat
der E. Keese.
The Congressmen.
In the first congressional district,
where Charles v.. Edwards declined
to oner for renomination, J. W.
Overstreet apparently has defeated
Peter W. . .m. former president
of th" American Bar association. The
count in the Twelfth district is in
favor of Judge W. E. Larsen in his
race against Congressman D. M.
Hughes and it will tniro
pleto returns to determine the winner.
Other congressmen who had
opposition apparently have been sue
cessful.
Returns in the court of appeals*
race, where 14 aspirants seek some
one of the three new judgeships
created by the last legislature, are
so meagre as to make the fortunes
of all doubtful The ticket was unI
usually long and in many instances
I election tabulators reported the complete
county vote for governor and
other State offices but left the countling
of the court of appeals ballots
until today. With so many in the
]race it is predicted that the selections
will not be determined until the
convention acts.
R. E. uavidson, incumbent, has a
wide popular and convention vote
lead over his three opponents for
I prison commissioner, but returns do
'not indicate he will have a majority
'in the convention.
0. M. Candler and Ouyton McLendon,
incumbents, have safe leads
over James H, Peeples and J. A.
Perry, respectively, for places on the
| railroad commission.
