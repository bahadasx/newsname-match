TEACHERS INSTITUTE
A Very Successful Institute is
Held Here This Week.
Wednesday evening marked
the closing of the first Teachers
Institute held in Ekalaka. Thirty
five teachers of central and south
ern Fallon County were in at
tendance for the three days pro
gram. Owing to the distance
that some of the teachers must
travel when the institute is held
at the county seat, County Super
intendent Miss Leonard this year
arranged for two separate ses
sions, one at Ekalaka for the
southern and central teachers
and one at Baker for the instruc
tors of the north section of the
county. That this arrangement
has pruven very satisfactory is
shown by the attendance. Mon
day was designated as "Trustees
Day" when subjects relating to
school district management and
better school facilities were dis
cussed. Tuesday and Wednes
day the regular institute program
for the teachers was held and
from those who attended we have
learned that this session was
very beneficial to the teacher?,
many interesting subjects having
been brought up and discussed.
Rural School Inspector C. W.
Tenny of Helena was here and
assisted Miss Leanoad in con
ducting the sessions. Monday
evening a social dance was held
at the Pla.v House for the teach
ers and a very nice time was had.
Tuesday evening Prof. Tenny de
livered a lecture at the Church.
Mr. Tenny is a very interesting
speaker and being well versed in
school matters of the state of
Montana commands strict atten
tion when discussing educational
subjects. His lecture was well
worth attending and his next vis
it to Ekalaka will be looked for
ward to with pleasure. Tuesday
evening the attending teachers
went to the pine hills and held a
picnic, red hot weiners being the
header for the bill of fare. The
entire program for the three days
was very interesting and besides
the benefits derived from the
various subjects discussed a bet
trr understanding of each others
school interests and troubles were

Real Outlaws at Fair Time
I
The authentic reproduction, in
motion pictures, of the extermi
nation of the notorious outlaw
bands of Oklahoma as well as the
scenes of their most daring raids,
is the object of the six reel fea
ture, "The Passing of The Okla
homa Outlaw." In this great
historical play all the original
characters who are still living are
actors. Four of the five U. S.
Marshalls most active in the ac
tual occurrences are still living.
The play shows the Daltons, Bill
Doolan, the Jennings gang and
dank Starr in many of their
tamous raids, hold-ups and bank
robberies, and shows them final
ly killed or captured by the forces
of iaw and order. Besides being
true in nearly every detail it is
one of the most thrilling western
photoplays ever produced and
points a good moral. This stir
ring realistic drama will be shown
at the Play House on Sept. 20th,
the second day of the Fair.
Bob Smith arrived yesterday

County Fair Next Week.
Tuesday will mark the opening
of the Fifth Annual Fallon Coun
ty Fair. Celebrations and race
meetings have been held in Eka
laka every year for the past
twenty years but it was not un
til four years ago that these
events could be properly classed
as fairs. With the coming of
trie homesteader and practical
farmer the methods of celebrat
ing each fall have gradually
changed until at this time, when
regular honest-to-goodness fairs,
with agricultural exhibits, live
stock exhibits and pumpkin shows
are the chief attractions. This
year's fair i n Fallon County
should be a success and while we
are not able to collect such a va
riety of exhibits as last year,
what we do show will be good
and attract the attention of the
visitor. The entertainment pro
gram has undergone a few
changes, new events having been
added during the past few days.
The Ekalaka band assisted by
a number of the members of the
Baker band will dispense the
music during the two days. In
the evenings dancing and shows
will 'enter the program. Mr.
Phillips of Baker will handle the
wild west program and has many
novel and interesting features
for the entertainment of the vis
itors. The races should be good
and everyone will have an oppor
tunity to enjoy themselves. Out
bide of the special premiums that
are being offered, the entire ex
pense of the entertainment pro
gram will be borne by the busi
ness men of Ekalaka. They have
prepared to entertain you. Will
you be there?
