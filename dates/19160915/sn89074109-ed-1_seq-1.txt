J. F. Carlock Gone
to His Reward
Prominent Farmer of Carlyle
District Passed to Great
Beyond After But Short
Illness.
John F. Carlock was born De
cember 12, 18-Ki -in Bed lord
county, Illinois. On July 4, 1808
he married Julia A. Stephens
which marriage had issue of
children as follows, Alpheus B.,
and 'Mrs. Nora Slalzman,deceas
ed Mrs. Cora O'Leary of Car
lock, Illinois, Mrs. Lydia Belsey
of Deer Creek, Illinois, Dillard
A., Artis and John F., Jr of Car
lyle, Montana.
On December 15th, 1910 Mrs.
Stephens Carlock died. He was
married to Mary A. Ayers Nov
ember 28th at Roneby, Minne
sota.
Mr. Carlock has during his
long active life enjoyed the best
of health until a stroke of paral
alysis a few days ago summon
ed him lo his long rest.
'The funeral services were
held at the Montana farmstead,
three miles south of Carlyle,
Saturday afternoon at 2:30,
Rev. Mr. Kcnniston conducting
the service, the pastor of the lo
cal United Brethren church as
sisting. The choir of the Carlyle
United ^Brethren church sang,
•and at the request of the family
Mr. Westby sang, "Abide With
Me."
'Father Carlock has from boy
hood been a reverent student of
the scriptures. His activity in
'Christian work is shown in his
years of service to the Christian
church as Elder, Superintendent
and teacher of the Sabbath
school and like religious activ
ities. His short final illness was
beautiful in its godly trust and
sweet Christian spirit. The four
teenth chapter of John was a
memory favorite and because
of his frequent quotation of that
wonderful "Comfort Chapter",
Mr. Kcnniston used it as a basis
of his remarks.
Interment was made atCarlock
Illinois where his remains will
lie with those of the son and
•deceases wife in the cemetery of
the olii town which honors him
•with its name
We wish to call especial at
tention to The Powers' ads in
this issue of Ihe Chronicle. This
popular clothing and shoe store
now has the largest stock of
clothing and shoes that it has
ever had since its inception and
it's slock consists of all new
goods for the fall and winter
trade. It's manager, T. J. Power
does not believe in carrying ov
er from one season to another
and as a result nothing old is
to be found at the Powers'. The
prudent buyer will not make a
mistake in looking over their
immense stock before buying
'sewhere.
Tn an article dealing with the
:Tublic
schools in the Chronicle
last week we were in error in
saving that the iew Board of
Education elected the faeully
Tor this year. The facts are that
"the /old board elected every
-member of the faculty with the!
exception of the Superintendent.

O'KEEFE APPOINTED
POSTMASTER AT BEACII
Arthur J. O'Keefc received
his appointment from President
Wilson and the confirmation of
the Senate as postmaster of the
city of Beach. Mr. O'Keefc is
one ot the early settlers of this
county, having hoinesleaded
one mile east of Beach, where
he now resides. He has always
taken an active part in public
affairs and is an active worker
or the Democratic party. lie
was nominated on the Demo
cratic ticket for the office of
county commissioner of Billings
county in 1012, just prior to the
segragalion of Golden Valley
county, and was appointed as
county commissioner of Golden
Valley county under Gov
.Burke,
Mr. O'Keefc succeeds John M.
Baer as postmaster, Mrt. Baer
having resigned a short while
ago. George Ilougen, assistant
postinaslar has been Acting
Postmaster since Mr. Baer was
relieved and will be in charge
of the oflice until Mr. O'Keefe
takes it over. While in charge
Mr. Ilougen has made some no
ticeable changes in the appear
ance of the office and lobby.
Through years of experience as
assistant postmaster George has
gained a knowledge of the re
quirements of that official pos
ition that we hope at some fu
ture date will prove of real val
ue lo him. The service given un
der his regime at present is
•orthy of commendation, and
although George thinks too
much of his civil service train
ing to claim any special credit
for the improvement, we can
but feel that his efforts to satis
fy the public cannot help
but meet with the notice of
which they are deserving.
WHY MATURE CORN
Mature corn .contains the
most food value whether it is
wanted for fodder or ears. The
nutrients in the ripe or nearly
•ipe corn are more digestible
than those in immature corn.
The way to secure ripe corn is
to plant home grown seed. Now
the time to select seed corn.
The best assurance for secur
ing ripe rorn next year is to se
iet seed corn in yourlocalityfor
planting. If you don't have a
'ield then try to secure permis
sion to buy some from a naigh
vou can select it in the field.
You can see just what von
are gelling. The maturit. I he
size of the car, the kind of stalks
and the number of barren stalks
can be determined/file ordvwav
to secure the best results with
•orn is to grow corn that ma
tures.
The way to secure corn that
matured in your locality or at
least near it is to -select
the seed corn carefully in the
field. North Dakota Experi

Million Doliar Concern Goes to
Fargo—Its Advantages
Recognised
Fargo has been selected by
he Equity Packing Plant Com­
mittee as the location for the
million dollar packing plant
that (Vganizaljion will foster,
and application for the charter
of the Equity Co-operative Pack­
ing plant already has gone for­
ward to the secretary of stale.
The exact site for the propos
ed plant has not been delinilely
established yet, six different sit­
es £eing under consideration,
three of these along the Sliey
enne river west of the city lim
its.
The Co-Operaors' Herald sets
forth the following reasons for
selecting Fargo:
In cHoosing 'Fargo the com
mittee staled that the reason
governing its decision were the
I wo questions of logical situa
tion and facilities for distribu
tion, with the possibility of se
curing financial support of suf
ficient magnitude to finance the
operations of the plant. It is re
cognized that large sums will
be required to finance the regu
lar operations after the plant is
opened. Fargo offered the larg
est possibilities in this respect
and the banks with one accord
came forward and pledged ev
ery possible support and co-op
eration. This was true to of the
other localities but the combin
ed .banking .facilities of Fargo
far outmeasured the numbered
facilities of other cities under
consideration.
Fargo, too, does an immense
tonnage in distribution at this
time. It is not generally known
I hat the big mail order houses
of tlu. east supply the major
porton of Iheir customrs west of
the wholesale houses at Fargo,
shipping great quantities of
goods out daily have perfected
a distributive system that will
mean a great deal to the new
plant and help mightily in the
distribution of its goods.

successful
business on the part of Ihc plant
right off the reel, a feature that
is of tremedous importance be
cause lliere will be no transport
ation cost connected with mar
keting the product consumed in
Fargo.
11 was considered that the
chief interest of the farmer, as
a producer of the raw product,
lay in having a market which
will consume the largest quan
his product in a plant
large enough to guarantee a
ready market at high prices. In
this connection it was shown
that a farmer in any part of N.
D. can load his stock and ship
io Fargo, unload, feed and wa
ter, olTer for sale and if not of
fered a satisfactory price, can
reload and ship to St. Paul or
Chicago without any loss or in
crease of rale over what would
have been Ihc rale if billed right
through from primary point,
establishing at once a competi
tive market wilh automatic re
gulation of the iprice situation
as related to the farmer. In oth
er words, if not satisfied that he
is getting the best price al the
Equity plant the farmer is not
put to the expense of rcsliipping
over a route already covered in
order lo reach a market which
is more favorable to him, if one
exists.
