EMIL T. EIUKSON DEAD
' The people of Liberal were Beverely
shocked Sunday when the report was
'-spread that Emll T. Erlkson. was
'dead. Although he had been In
poor health several months, he was
still at work In the Summers store
' Wednesday, and to hear of his death
' Sunday seemed almost incredible. He
Tiad been a sufferer from kidney trou
ble for some time but no one consld
' ered his case a dangerous one. How
ever, he took to his bed on Thurs
day morning of last week and had to
give up the good fight Sunday. Sugar
diabetes had developed and no help
availed.
Mr. Erfkson was born in Geary
county, Kansas, March 19, 1882, and
died September 10, ISIS, aged 34
years, S months and 21 days. On
February 17, 1914, he was married
'to Miss May Edna Smith, daughter of
Mr. and Mrs. J. U. Smith of this city,
'who with one son survives him. Be
sides the wife and son he leaves a
mother, four sisters and three broth
ers to mourn his departure. All the
above relatives arrived in time to at
tend the funeral. Mr. ErlkBon had
been with the firm of Chas. Summers
& Sons about four years, and had al
ways proved a faithful, honest and
industrious employe.
Funeral services were held at the
Christian church Monday afternoon,
conducted by Rev. H. F. Bolton, and
Interment was made in the Liberal
-cemetery under the auspices of the
Masonic order, of which he was a
member. Thus passes from the scene
of earthly activity a young .man of
promise, a devoted husband, loving
father, good friend and respected citi
zen. His family and relatives have
the heartfelt sympathy of a' large
circle of friends In their bereave
ment, and the Democrat desires to be
numbered among those who feel a
sincere regret at his passing on.

Liberal Lodge No. 1660, Loyal Or
ier or Moose, was instituted on
Thursday night of last week. The
lodge begins its life with a charter
membership of 60 members. Chas.
Benj. Lopp, district director of the
order, who has been here several
weeks organizing the new lodge, had
charge of the organization work. The
lodge starts off with a good bunch of
officers at the head of it. They are:
Dan Murphy, dictator; Dr. J. D.
Welch, past dictator; Chas. M. Tuck
er, vice dictator; R. W. Dickersonv
prelate; Earl Mauls, sergeant-at-arms;
Ray Kennedy, secretary; E. D.
Cooper, treasurer; Robt. Record, In
side guard; Clayton Malone, outside
guard; E. J. Fitzgerald, Ray Millman
and J. W. McGee, trustees.
The Moose fraternity owns its own
educational institute and home for
dependent children of Its members,
and Includes a home for aged mem
bers, at Mooseheart, Illinois, which
was dedicated by Vice President
Marshall on July 28, 1913. Mr. Mar
shall, by the way, Is a member of the
order, as Is President Wilson, Gov
ernor Capper, and a number of other
men prominent in the business and
political life of the country. At this
home are at present 337 children get
ting an education tree of expense to
them, and they have the choice of a
curriculum of 29 vocations to select
their life work. This order was first
organized April 12, 1888, and held
as a social order until 1906, when it
was made a beneficiary society under
the laws of the state of Indiana. To
day there are nearly 1,700 Moose
lodges scattered throughout the
United States, Canada, Alaska, Cuba,
South America, Europe, Hawaii, the
Philippines and Australia. They
claim to have the greatest Increase
In membership during that time of
any fraternal order In the world. It
Is a good order to belong to and we
hope the Liberal lodge soon gets a
big enough membership to erect their
own home, which they are contem
plating doing in the near future.
.. v- AAWED INTO HIti IIANO .
Contractor J. B. Hubbart happened
to an accident Wednesday that may
cost him several fingers. He acci
dentally got his hand in front of a
circular saw In his workshop with the
result that the saw ripped Into his
hand and will cause him to lose one
or more digits. Mr. Hubbart had re
cently had a minor accident to the
thumb on that hand, and this one
coming on top of that, right at this
busy time, makes it quite a serious
incident for him.
NEARLY AN INCH OF RAIN
Seward county received .92 of an
inch of rain Sunday-night and Mon
day forenoon. This wasn't a very
heavy fall, but taken with the other
rains of about the same quantity dur
ing the last few weeks, it goes a long
way toward helping the country. The
land is now ready for fall plowing
and considerable wheat is going in
to the ground at this time. It also
helps mature the row crops, of which
there will be an abundance this year.
SOUTHWEST FAIR IN PROT,,,W8
The Southwest Fair, the big event '
of the year for Liberal and the en
tire Southwest, 1b In progress this
week and closes tonight. $Th) good
shower of rain Sunday nigh." 'arid.
inonaay morning maae ming loot
tor a little while like It might prove
a damper to the festivities, but the
clouds blew away and . Tuesday
proved to be the biggest first day of
the fair since It was organized.
Tuesday, however, was spent mostly
in putting the finishing touches to
the grounds, buildings, and other de
tails that had not been attended to
before that time, and the fair proper
had hardly started until Wednesday..
The biggest drawing card and the
best advertisement put out by the
town of Liberal was the parade
staged Wednesday afternoon through
the principal business and residence
streets of the city. The floats were
beautiful and the parade was watched
by a bigger crowd than ever greeted
a circus in the towr.! The advertis
ing iiuhib tJHyeuiiiiiy are uobui viub vi
(special mention as each one was a
perambulating advertisement of the
uuBiness nouatj. u represen va. every

siderable Ingenuity on the part of Us
decorators and they were all so dif
ferent t.'lmt none co'-ld be accused of
copying another'? design. It would
be hnd to make special mention of
any particular one without slighting
t), fathers, b nee we will let It go by
saying the parade will undoubtedly

the futur')6u.iA ...
I We we'e Informed yesterday by
1 Z V0 offlclal" that ne had Ju8t
ini.i ',iounting the number of cars
on the fair, grounds. Outside of the
enclosure he found 260 cars, inside
were 200, limiting a total of 460 cars
present at one time. Yesterday was
Oklahoma day and a good share of
the cars bore Oklahoma tags, thus
showing a decided courtesy on the
part of our neighbors across the state
line In sending such a large delega
tion to attend a Kansas event. .
You couldn't find a better display
of livestock, hogs and agricultural
products in a country where land
sells for $150 per acre than you And
this week at the fair grounds. If peo
ple from the east could be here to
attend this and view these products
they would immediately see the folly
of living on that high priced land
Where they raise no more than we do
here, on land that costs only a frac
tion of the eastern real estate.
The attendance this year is con
siderably in excess of last year's and
It Is thought the management will
come out considerably more to the
good than formerly, and last year's
surplus was over $1,000. Time Is not
allowed to hang heavily on your
hands out at the grounds as there is
something doing every minute of the
day. Ball games, horse races, doll
racks, everything that goes to make
up a good country fair, is represent
ed, and if you haven't been out there
up to this time you had better sneak
away from your work a few hours
and mingle with the crowd. It will
do you good.
