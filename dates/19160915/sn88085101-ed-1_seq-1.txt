made a cheat hit.
Ihe Society Circus' given last Frl-
M?KM nder ! he dlrec,lon of the lach-ga-
Bibble society, was one of the most
successful and meritorious public en
tertainments of a local and amateur
Oroville it was a great hit from the
enjoyable and entertaining character
of the program, from the excellent ar
rangements by which there was not a
break or slip in the proceedings and
from the universal satisfaction ex
pressed by the crowds of patrons The
only feature that bore true to the name
was the street pageant. The perform
ance was very much in the nature of a
vaudeville, and a most excellent vaude
ville at that.
The parade was a real surprise to
the public on account of its novelty
and attractiveness. Headed bv the Oro
ville band in full uniform, with two
brightly and elaborately decorated
automobiles containing a galaxy of
handsome Hawaiian and Japanese
girls, costumed true to native charac
ter, with a clown, children in costumes
on horseback and in carts, gigantic fe
male on stilts, and an amusing imita
tion of an elephant, the procession
marched through the principal streets,
creating much amusement for an unu
sually large number of people, both
residents of the town and visitors from
the country, and eliciting no end of
favorable comment.
Two entertainments were given in
the Orpheum. afternoon and evenine,
and on both occasions the theatre was
crowded with a well pleased crowd.
The program was made up of musical,
numbers, dancing and drills, in which
a large number of young people took
part. Each and every one of the per
formers did their part creditably,
showing that they had been thorougly
drilled and coached.
The dance in the evening was one of
the most largely attended and conse
quently most enjoyable that has taken
place in the Orpheum this season, and
this is saying a great deal in its favor,
for there have been many dances and
much joy at that place of entertain
ment during the past eight months.
The Isoh-ga-Bibble society is to be
congratulated upon the success of the
undertaking, both on account of the
character of the entertainment and the
substantial financial returns as a re
ward for their efforts. The society was
at considerable expense preparing for
and carrying out the circus, yet will
clear between pm and |9O.

Th< local library is in a very Mont
is! mg condition and growing stiaoily
thanks to the efforts of the Civic
League, the organization responsible
for Oroville having such an elegant
library building and library Recently
J F Samson made a most acceptable
donation of 36 volumes of fiction to the
Civic League library. They were the
few remaining numbers of the old
drug store library. Such gifts are
greatly appreciated by the League, and
will be by the patrons of the library.
Another valuable donation was made
to the library this week which was
equally appreciated. L. L. Work handed
in. besides bundles and bundles of con
secutive numbers of the Saturday
Evening Post and Everybody's. 27
nicely bound books. Many of these
were reference and religious volumes
of exceptional value. The library room
is not large enough to accommodate all
of the magazines which have been
given the institution, and it is believed
they would be Interesting to people
who have not been taking periodicals
regularly more than to those visiting
the reading room. Therefore, they have
been sorted out to the number of some
400 which the league wdll be glad to
dispose of. They will be given away on
the regular library days. Tuesdays and
Saturdays. Come and get your share.

ult time to get around among the
otera of the First district, and organ-
Ration naturally was Imperfect Had

sooner he would have won out it re
a l “ h f ardeat kind 01 «ork. with
n ...o 1 °J prouusos and misstate
ments on the part of those who were
opposed to him. to secure his defeat
Moreover, had men who promised to
support Mr. Smith stood to their word
tlie r. suit would have been different
Had the precincts that owe Oroville a
debt of giatltude shown a disposition
Smfn and t , r a le , lo their word
would have been elected. When-

loimse to other towns the people
nr.t-M d thplr word 111 return.
Oroville is always thrown down It is
evident from the election that in the
future Oroville is going to act verv
much as a unit. Mr. Smith should feel
proud of his home support. For the
first time the people nave stood to
gether on a proposition. One of the
strongest arguments of the Miller fac
tion was that Oroville would split even
i n the conimissionership. as the town
was never known to stand together,
and that had its effect in the election
May this election see the dawn of
gteater things for Oroville. It shows
that all the people can combine, and it
is only by combination that any good
can he accomplished. Those who insist
in standing against the public interest
are so few that their influence should
no longer keep the community divided
Once working as a unit Oroville will
take that place on the map that its
importance entitles it to assume.
AT THE OKPHEi >l.

the Orpheum will present a thrilling
drama in “The Cup of Life," a Mutual

I.VIMC NEWS NOTES,
Mr. Farnam will be seen in the lead
ing role in that most beautiful of all
plays, "The Call of the Cumberlauds,”
which will hold the boards at the Ly
ric on Wednesday and Thursday nights
of this week. In the "Call of the Cum
berlands,” Mr. Farnam is said to
eclipse even his famous portrayal of
"The Gentleman from Indiana," which
appeared in this house a short time
since. The story depicts one Samson
South, destined to be the leader of his
clan of the Souths in their fudal activ
ities with the Hollman faction in the
Cumberland mountains, displays great
talent as an artist. During a period of
a truce between the two factions he
is discovered by a noted artist who is
in the mountains painting the scenic
beauties of nature. Held in the grip of
indicision as to leaving his mountain
home and the love of his youth or cast
ing aside ambition. He finally decides
to go to New York and study. There
he meets the beautiful and polished
sister of his benefactor, and as success
is pouring its wealth at his feet, he
answers the “Call of the Cumber
lands” and returns to lead his faction
in a spectacular battle with the Heil
mans who have violated the truce —and
then Samson South answers the call of
his heart. A beautiful story beautifully
told.
For Saturday and Sunday the offer
ing will be one of Pauline Frederick's
best productions, “The Spider.” In this
production Miss Frederick plays the
rolls of two characters simultaneously,
that of a mother and her daughter. A
strong melo drama, well staged and
well supported.
TEACHER’S RECEPTION.
There will be a reception to the pub
lic school teachers at the Methodist
church Saturday evening. September
16th. This will afford a pleasant oppor
tunity for all patrons and friends to
become acquainted with those in
charge of our schools. 'I here will be
a good program of interest after which
an informal reception will be held. Re
member the time and place.
ORFHEIM* TONIGHT.
The De Moss family, entertainers
will appear in concert at the Orpheum
tonight Tills is a guaranteed attrac
tion bv a family of artists, composers
and child musical wonders. It will be
a musical treat. You will enjoy it.

( I.USE OK IRRIGATION SEASON.
The directors of the irrigation dis
trict have decided to close the gat<-s
for irrigation purposes on September
;,oth. All irrigation water should be ap
plied before that date.
K Frns and George Engle left Wed
nesday tor Baker City, Oregon on a
business trip.
A hot run it was between Clair Ward
and I>d Maloney, and the old timer
came fery near sneaking the bacon.
Frafik Smith, an uncle of Ross Brat
tain. was iu town Tuesday morning in
company with Mr. Brattain. Mr. Smith
came across the plains iu I' - , m an
ox wagon, settling in Oregon, where
he has since lived. He is a rock-ribbed
republican and the news from Maine
warmed the cockles of his heart. He
ran against an ancient sympathizer
when he hit this office.
Dr. D. H. Lewis has received and in
stalled his new X-ray machine, one of
the best in use. This wonderful inven
tion has revolutionized surgery, as
through its means dislocations and
breaks can be distinctly observed and
foreign substances in the body located.
It completes Dr. Lewis’ operating
equipment, and will be invaluable in
treating cases at the hospital when it
is opened.
Much complaint is heard from those
who drew numbers in the Colville In
dian reservation on account of the
scarcity of homesteads worth filing
on. E|tlly 50 per cent of the first hun
dred iucky number holders have fail
ed tq make selections. The fact has
been plain to all familiar with the
country that there has been misrepre
sentation as to the quantity of good
laud on the reservation About all of
the best land was given to the Indians.
This does not mean that there
are no fairly choice homesteads to be
had pn the reserve, but they are few
and far between as compared with the
representations made prior to the
drawing.
Aij Overhaul car driven by Stevie
Mali* and containing several passen
gers collided with a Ford driven by
L. E» Valle and Mr. Barman on the
road, between Osoyoos and Falrview,
Sunday, much to the defacement ol the
Ford. The Overland did not escape
without sundry deformations. Very
fortunately no one was seriously hurt.
Indeed the only person showing any
maria of the accident was Mr LaVelle
wao bad his left eye cut by coiling in
contact with the wind shield. Both
drivers claim that they were traveling
at a very moderate speed, although
the Impact that caused the damage
must have been caused by a car going
more than five miles an hour.

Republicans gained a sweeping vic
tory in Maine Monday. Prior to the
election both sides claimed the election
by large majorities. Maine had one
democratic senator, a congressman and
the governor. Monday, two republican
senators were elected, four congress
men. the governor and legislature.
The majority run up to almost 14.wm.
