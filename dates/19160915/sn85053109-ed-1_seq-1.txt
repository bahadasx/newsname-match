Thresher Begins
to Tell The Tale
Splendid Reports from the
Marias Siope Section
Coming In
The first threshing report of
1916 that reached the Pioneer
Press office came from the Mar
ias Slope country south of
Ethridge. Ten acres of spring
wheat on the farm of Alfred
Hallenbar, south of Ethridge,
yielded 45 bushels. Alfred has
42 acres of wheat on his home
stead. Threshing operations on
his homestead were prevented
by rain.
The crops in the Fthrihge
Valley this year are the best
since farming began in that
section. The Marias Slope
country, southwest of Ethridge
and south of Cut Bank has
harvested a record-smashing
crop. That section was favor
ed with a heavy rain last spring,
about ten days before the rainy
season set in north of Cut Bank.
Therefore the crop matured
much earlier and threshing
operations down there are now
under wav.
Harvest is general in the
north country. The wheat is
not so rank as last year and
probably will not yield as
heavily, but the big difference
in price will more than offset
the possible lower yield. The
flax crop is the best ever seen
in this section and the acreage
is the biggest hundreds of
acres since farming began here.
The season uf 1916 is, all in
all, the most favorable that this
section has ever seen. The
grain and flax harvest will
bring more money than the
record harvest of last year.
The big ranchers north of
Headlight have gone into the
stock business on quite an ex
tensive scale and butterfat
cattle in large herds can be
seen on all sides. In the old
cattle days the wealth de
rived from stock was for the
most part absorbed by abseitee
owners at Helena and else
where. Today the herJs are
not so large but the collective
number if probably'as great,
and owned by men who make
the Cut Bank community their
home.
This section is now in an ex
ceptionally prosporous condition
Wise judgment and caution in
planning for the coming years
should temper our enthusiasm.
If we build wisely now our
stability as a great grain and
stock region is assured.

glasses and want them properly ad'

Mass Meeting
Monday Night
Electric lights were the main
topic of conversation at the
council meeting Monday eve
ning. An application and pro
posed ordinance presented by
Lewis & Albin was read and
discussed. This proposition if
adopted as submitted would
give grantees a twenty-year
franchise and contract the city
to purchase ail current for
lighting and power purposes
from them. The proposition
fixed maximum rates for com
mercial and residence lighting,
heating, etc., and contained a
clause allowing the city to par
ticipate in the profits of the
plant whenevçr the net profits
exceeded a certain amount.
S. M. Hawver also made ap
plication for a franchise, on
similar terms, except that he
offered a sliding scale of rates,
becoming one cent per kilowatt
less each year for three years,
with a final rate of 15c, the
fourth year, and thereafter.
As the council did not feel
justified in ( .taking final action
upon this matter with the in
formation at hand it was de
cided to hold a public meeting
at the council chambers next
Monday evening, in order to
ascertain the sentiment of the
people in regard to the pro
positions submitted and the
advisability of calling an elec
tion at which to decide whether
or not such a franchise shall be
granted.
Reports of the police magis
trate, town treasurer and water
department were read and ap
proved, and the board of health
was granted the use of the
police department for enforcing
sanitary laws.
Praises the Plant
(Independent)
C. E. Miles, a government
flax fibre expert, was here last
week and spent several days
looking over the Conrad flax
fibre mill and the flax crop in
this section. Mr. Miles was most
enthusiastic in his statements
concerning the future of the
flax fibre industry here, and
stated that the Pearson process
used by the local concern, was
one of the very best in the
United States, and in fact was
producing much petter results
than any orher method of which
he knew. The Flax Fibre
company this week have an
expert here operating a pulling
machine, which is said to work
very satisfactorily. This ma
chine wiil add very materially
the value of the crop.

Republicans Draft Platform to
Meet the New Time in Montana
BY I. C. KARTACK
Tbe re-united Republican Party
of Montana met in convention as
sembled at the Placer Hotel, in
Helena, at noon Saturday last. It
was a meeting of tremendous im
portance for it brought together
upon a common meeting ground ali
former factions of the Party in
harmonious conference, it welded
and merged those great forces that
believe unequivically iu the prin
ciple that government was es
abliehed to protect for all lime the
rights and opportunities of every
individual, whether ou laud or sea;
forces that advocate a virile
Americanism that will tolerate no
violation of the inalienable rights of
mankind.
The voice of the people of Mon
tana was heard in the Republican
Convention at Helena. It rose
above the voice of organized Cap
ital; it drowned the voice of the
Brewery and Distillery Interests; it
hurled defiance iu the face of Cor
ruption aud Greed; it dealt a telling
blow upon an admiuistraiiou which
refuses to put into operation a iaw
that is of vital interest to the far
mers of the State of Montana; it re
verberated and swelled in volume
until it dominated the Convention
Hall; it worked its way into the
Platform and crystalized there the
promise of a Greater and Better
Montana. Thus did the voice of the
People speak.
Tbe Platform of the Republican
Party of Montana advocates: the
passage of legislation that will bring
about a more equitable and just dis
tribution of the burdens of taxation;
he principle of a license tax upon
the net protfis of mines to the end
that the producing mines of Mon
tana will be required to pay an
equitable proportion of the taxes of
the State; the passage of a law
amending the present grain inspec
Mis s Rankin Is
Coming Saturday
Miss Jeanette Rankin, re
publican nominee for Congress
from Montana, will speak in
Cut Bank Saturday evening; in
Brown's hall.
The visit to Cut Bank of Miss
Rankin is eagerly awaited bv
people of all political persua
sions. Miss Rankin, by her
spectacular lead of over a half
dozen aspirants for congress on
the republican primary ballot,
has jumped into national prom
inence. In fact Miss Rankin
had attained national prom
inence in a measure before her
nomination, having been acti
vely identified with the suffrage
and temperance movements in
the state and nation tor the past
few years.
Towns and cities all over
Montana are clamoring to se
cure the little lady for speaking
engagments, besieging the state
committee. So Cut Bank is
rather fortunate in being favor
ed by a dating so early in the
campaign.
Regardless of your political
belief, come out and hear Miss
Rankin Saturday evening.

into a meaning all their own. They

Visit is Brief But
Very Pleasant One
The Great Falls Trade ex
cursion train made a stop of
nearly an hour in Cut Bank
last evening and during the
brief time alotted the business
men of the northern Montana
metropolis had an opportunity
to learn of the cordial feeling
for that city that exists in Cut
Bank and the genuine good
wishes for the attainment of its
ambitions to be the marketing
and distributing point for this
territory. There was no set
program. Band music, auto
rides about the city and suburbs
and a closer cementing of good
fellowship consumed the time
that the delegation remained
here.
Threshing is under way on
the John Graham ranch on the
Marias . Slope. The spring
wheat is running about 40 bu

'Dry' Special
Here Monday
Cut Bank had a presidential
candidate as its guest on Tues
day afternoon. J.Frank Hanley
ex-govenor of Indiana, pro
hibition candidate for president,
his running mate for vice pres
ident and a gentleman named
Stewart, together with their
wives and other members of
the party, came in on a special
train at 2:10 and while the train
crews were changing short ad
dresses were delivered. The
speakers exhorted those who
assembled to renounce the dem
ocratic and republican parties
and vote the prohibition ticket.
The talks were listened to at
tentatively but few if any con
verts were made. There is no
need for a prohibition party in
the nation. The big political
parties are falling in line for
prohibition. The question is all
but settied in Montana. Both
political parties have come out
for a "dry" state. So a vote for
prohibition is a vote wasted, as
we see it.

portance in offial circles of the

Washington' D. C., Sept. 8.
t the closing hours of the
session, today, the Senate pass

acre grazing homestead bill,
with some amendments. It
had already passed the House.
It did not pass the Senate, how
ever, in time for the House to
act on the amendment and for
the bill to be enrolled before
adjournment. The bill retains
its status though. At the be

it will come up in the House,
when the amendments will be
concurred in or go to conference
and be disposed of. It applies
all public land states and
provides for homestead entry
of six hundred and forty acres
of land of such character that it
takes that much to support a
family and is not susceptible of
irrigation but is capable of
growing forage crops. Persons
who have have homesteaded
lands of that character in less
quantity than six hundred and
forty acres may enter enough
