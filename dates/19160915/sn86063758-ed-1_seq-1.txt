The temporary reporter for The j
Herald .and News had the right one
on his mind, but having it stronger on
his mind not to use the wrong one, the
temporary reporter, in the rush of the
election^ balled it up, just as several
others connected with the paper balled
up some of his stuff or junk in the
last issue.
"The Kiss of Hate" deals with the
tragic experience of Xadia Turgeneff,
whose father, the Governor of Valogda,
a Russian province, notorious for its I
persecution of the Jews, is assassinated
by the Perfect of Police, who is the
real power in the district. How the
Perfect seeks to make Nadia serve his
own base purposes by threats of torture
and Siberia for her only brother,
and how she curses him, even as she
bows to his 'brutal will, form the basis
for a plot, the development of which
gives the fullest play to Miss Barrymore's
wonderful dramatic ]fr>wers.

News and Courier.
The comparatively few returns from
Tuesday's primary received since the
publication of the figures in The News
and Courier yesterday, when it was
definitely stated thiat Governor Rich
ard I. Manniig had been renominated
o.er his opponent, former Governor
Cole L. Blease, by a safe majority,
which is still practically as It was
given yesterday. There are probably
not more than 1,500 votes yet to come
in and that number cannot possibly
change the result. With 137,219 votes
accounted for the standing for Governor
is:
Manning 70,972
Blease 68,247
Manning's majority 4.725
CANSLER CERTAIN WINNER.
For railroad commissioner James
Cansler has increased his majority
over Albert Fant to approximately
25,000.
Close in First Circuit.
An extremely close race is that for ^
solicitor of the 1st circuit betweenj
kindred J. Hydrick, of Orangeburg, and
Ed CT Mann, of iSt. Matthews. The complete,
but official, count gives Hy-1
drick a lead of five votes. While j
great care has been taken in compiling
the figures for this contest, and it is
believed that they -are correct, still it
may require the official count to decide
the winner.
For Congress.
With eight boxes missing in the entire
3d district, for Congress Fred H.
Dominick has a majority of 2,493 over
Wyatt Aiken, encumbent.
