A MAXWELL RECORD
Popular Car Participates in
Sociability Tour Thru
Central California
Competing with a field of twenty
odd cars representing in nearly
every instance one of the most
popular machines on the market
today each one oi wnich was
considerably higher priced and
possessing much greater horse
power the Maxwell entry in the
Third Annual Sociability Tour of
the San Francisco Bay District
distinguished itself in a manner
which easily made it the most
conspicuous participant in the
event
Routed over the most scenic
section of California the very
heart of the Sierras where road
conditions oi every description
are encountered the course of
the tourists this year was by way
of Sacramento Auburn Tahoe
Tavern Tallac Myers Wood
fords Minden and Gardnerville
Nevada Bridgeport Mono Lake
and the Tioga Pass which
diagonally bisects Yosemite Na
tional Park
Ordinarily the roads which tap
the above mentioned regions
would be good and fair but ow
ing to extensive development
work in these mountain passes
of Central California the roads
have been rendered almost im
passable by heavy trucking and
teaming during the past spring
and summer So bad were the
roads found to be in many places

ARIZONA STATE FAIR
Harness Races This Fall
Will Be the Largest
Ever Held
If early indications are a criter
ion the harness races at the
that several of the drivers of the State Fair this fall will be by far
biggest cars declared they would J the largest ever held in the South
not have entered the run had i west
they known the true conditions
Approximately 800 miles were
covered by the motorists that
took part in the tour The Max
well car driven by B G McKis
sick was the smallest machine
in line The tour lasted four
days the Maxwell being last to
check out of the various controls
each day but the car was never
the last to come into a control at
night
During the entire four days
heavy grind barring delays
caused by three punctures no
stops were made on account of
mechanical or engine trouble
While the grades in some places
were such as to make the passen
gers of the car gasp and the
road conditions over these in
clines the very worst that one
can possibly imagine the Max
well took every one of them with
out a whimper
The principal object of the tour
was to encourage motoring thru
the scenic sections of the Sierras
1 and to make the glories of the
I latter more widely known The
I run also embraced many sdcial
I ftfinfllvia Of fhoca irinirlcinfcs
the most enjoyable was a trout
breakfast served on the shores
of Lake Teneya near the summit
of Tioga Pass on which occasion
the Maxwell Motor Sales Corpora
tion was the host
Friday September first was
the closing day for entries in
colt races These races will prove
to be one of the big drawing
cards of the Fair
With the closing date for en
tries in the aged horse events
still four weeks away Secretary
Shaughnessy reports that he al
ready has more entries for these
events than were received alto
gether last year The fact that
the Arizona State Fair is held
late in November after all the
other race meets are over tends
to draw the horsemen from all
sections of the country The
horses on the Grand Circuit and
the Great Western Circuit will
work south and wind up in Phoe
nix The same can be said of
those racing on the Rocky Moun
tain and Pacific Coast circuits
Efforts are being made to in
duce horsemen from all parts of
the country to winter in Arizona
as the climate of this section af
fords ideal training quarters for
horses the year around and it is
believed that several of the big
eastern horsemen will winter
their stables on the State fair
grounds this winter
Bruce McLaughlin
Hurt in Collision
What might have been a fatal
accident accurred today about
1210 noon at the I street cross
ing of the Arizona Eastern Rail
road when the southbound pas
senger train which was late
collided with an automobile
driven by Bruce W McLaughlin
an employee of the Mountain
States Telephone and Telegraph
Co
McLaughlin who lives on I
street beyond the railroad tracks
was on his way home for lunch
and driving slowly Asheneared
the tracks at the crossing the
passenger train which was com
ing fast struck the automobile
throwing McLaughlin up against
the north side of Charles Kreu
gers house and making a total
wreck of the machine
Karl Sloan of the Solomon
Wickersham Co saw the acci
dent and immediately telephoned
Dr McWhirt who hastened to
the scene and brought McLaugh
lin to the Gila Valley Sanitarium
where the doctor dressed a cut
on the jaw and took McLaughlin
to his home
The doctor will make a further
examination of the injured man
to determine if he is hurt in
ternally He seems to suffer from
shock and from the cut on his
jaw but apparently no bones are
broken
