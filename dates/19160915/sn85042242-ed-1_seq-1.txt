DREDGE COL. MICHIE
OF GREAT ASSISTANCE
Large Crowds Witness Thrilling
Spectacular Scene Off Coos
Bay Harbor
'Marshfleld, Ore., Sept. 14.—Fire to­
night completely destroyed the Pa­
cific Steamship liner, Congress, off
Coos Bay bar. Several vessels help­
ed to remove the 253 passengers and
crew of 110. It is believed that no
lives were lost, although this will
not be established beyond a doubt
until all boats which went to the
scene have returned here.
When the dredge, 'Michie, and the
gas schooner, Tillamook, reached the
Congress they found the liner almost
completely shrouded in smoke, and
the passengers fighting frantically to
enter the lifeboats. .Despite the
stress of the situation, however. Cap­
tain N. E. Cousins and his crew man­
aged to maintain control and the
work of transferring the people
aboard to the rescue vessels was car­
ried out in an orderly manner.
Every Life Is Saved.
The dredge. Col. P. S. Michie dock­
ed at North Bend near here tonight,
with all the passengers and the crew
of the steamer, Congress safe on
board. Not a life was lost, nor a sin­
gle person injured.
The Congress came to a stop off
the Coos bay bar at 4: SO p. m., and
was anchored between two buoys,
with her stern pointed toward the
beach. The dredge, Michie, was soon
at the scene. Boats were lowered at
once and people from the shore saw
the people taken across the interven­
ing space to the dredge.
It was daylight and the flames
were plainly visible breaking from
the stern of the craft. The work of
rescuing the passengers went on with
great precision. and those with glass­
es saw the forward deck covered
with many persons getting away from
the fierceness of the flames.
Presents Weird Scene.
The gasbHhe schooner, Tillamook,
arrived just before the last of the
passengers tVere removed. The scene
as night closed in was weird. The
heavy smoke of the burning vessel
obscured her from sight at several
points along the beach, but those who
went to the lighthouse had an unim­
paired view. Several small boats were
coming down the bay and they were
lost to -sight as they entered the
smoke, which hovored over the burn­
ing ship. *'j
At 7:15 the Michie pulled away,
giving those on shore the impres­
sion that everybody was saved. The
steam schooner, A. A. Simpson, which
reached the Congress too late to as­
sist. and the Tillamook stood by when
the Michie departed.
Heat Becomes Unbearable.
Before the last boat left, in which
was Captain Cousins, the smoke and
heat on the Congress was almost un­
bearable. Flames were shooting out
of the ventilators and up the passage
ways.
Soon after the vessels left, the
flames enveloped her from stem to
stern, lighting the sky a crimson hue.
With the wind and tide the steamer
then began drifting in toward the
shore on Coos bay.

CO-OPERATOR'S HERALD
Fargo, N. D„ Sept. 14—T. F. Mc
Cue, former attorney general, today
filed suit against the Co-operative
Herald, of this city, for damages
amouting to $50,000, asking a like
amount from A. M. Baker, editor of
the publicatoin. His claim is based
on an article recently published by
the Herald, charging McCue was col­
lecting a "slush fund" to defeat the
Non-partisan league candidates for
the supreme court.
ATTACKED BY COW.

down by an infuriated crow, Paul
Wicka, residing near here, was saved
from death by the prompt action of
an autoist, a half mile distant, who

Baifibrick
Is Given
A Respite
New York, Sept. 14.—Gov. Whit­
man today granted a respite until
Oct. 2 in the case of Thos. Bain
brick, whose executiion at Sing Sing
prison for the murder of Patrolman
George Dapping of New York, in 1915,
had been fixed for tomorrow morning.
This is the second time Bainbrick has
been given a respite.
The ordeal of watching tests of the
current, after he had been detailed to
aid in adjusting the wires and con­
tacts of the electric chair, lead to a
statement by Frank Meehan, a Sing
Sing convict, it was learned tonight,
on which was based the respite to
Bainbrick. Meehan said, according
to the authorities, that he witnessed
the shooting of Dapping and that the
murderer was not Bainbrick.
OEIOCRATS START
LAYING PLANS FOR
Wilson Will Start His "Porch
Campaign" at Shadow Lawn
Next, Week
WILL AVOID
PERSONALITIES
l*ong Branch, N. J„ Sept. 14.—The
part President Wilson is to take in
his campaign for re-election was dis­
cussed today by the president, Sec­
retary of the Treasury McAdoo, Post­
master General Burleson and Secre­
tary Tumulty. The plans, it was an­
nounced tonight, will ibe put into final
shape at a meeting here Monday be­
tween President Wilson, Vance Mc
Cormick, the chairman of the Demo­
cratic committee, and Homer S. Cum
mings, head of the speakers' bureau
of the national committee.
The president will not begin his
"porch campaign" at. Shadow Lawn
until next week. It the meantime,
he will write a number of letters to
Democratic candidates in doubtful
states. Although he has definitely
decided to make no speeches away
from here except before /ion-partisan
organizations, his political advices
said today the president, expected to
get the views before the country ef­
fectively.
A decision has been reached that
the campaign for the re-election of
the president will follow closely the
lines of his speech of acceptance.
Mr. Wilson also 'has decided to
avoid personalities as much as pos­
sible, and devote himself strictly to
telling of the achievements of his
administration and to attacks on the
Republican party He made tentative
plans tonight for leaving here Mon­
day night for St. Louis, to address
an association of underwriters. It is
possible, however, that the trip may
be canceled if there should be a slid
den turn for the worse in the condi­
tion of Mrs. Annie Howe, his sister,
who is critically ill at New London,
Conn.
Justice Christiatason of the state
supreme court, in an opinion concur­
ring with the other members of the
tribunal, to the erffect that the capi
tal removal amendment was illegal
because the initiative clause of the
constitution was not self-execuiting,
considers at length the question of
jurisdiction.
"The people in their constitution
have said the judicial power in this
state, the power to interpret and ap
ply laws," declares Judge Christian
son, "shall be vested in the courts.
And in their consittution they have
created and designated the courts
authorized to perform these func­
tions. Yet. if respondent is correct
in his contention, the power to inter­
pret and apply the constitutional pro­
vision under consideration, and deter­
mine all questions arising tehreunder,
including the legal sufficiency of the
initiative petitions and the qualifica­
tions of the signers thereto, is vested,
not in the courts, but in the secre­
tary of state, who is not a judicial,
but a political, officer.
"Obviously the interpretation and
application of this constitutional pro­
vision and the determination of the
various questions likely to arise
thereunder would require exercise of
the very highest degree of judicial
skill and judgment.
"It is difficult to conceive of any
legal questions of more profound im­
portance to the people of the state.
And if it was intended to confer such
power upon the secretary of state,
we should expect to find the power
conferred in positive and unequivo­
cal terms. Yet it is conceded that
such power, if conferred at all. is con­
ferred by implication only."

CONSTABULARY EXPENSE
SHOULD BE EQUALIZED
Details of Proposed Plan Have
Not Been Worked Out
Thought Idea Is Good One
New London, Conn., Sept. 14.—'Ma­
jor General Tasker H. Bliss, assist­
ant cief of staff of the United
States army, is to appear before the
American-Mexican commission tomor­
row, when discussion of border prob­
lems is renewed. It was thought ad­
visable that he should explain in per­
son to the Mexican commissioners
the military aspects of border plans
as seen by United States army offi­
cials.
No definite plan for border patrols
has taken shape in the minds of the
commissioners. The Americans con­
ferred with General Bliss again to­
day.
It was indicated that the proposal
which has appealed most strongly to
them, was that a border constabulary
be created to operate as a police
force along both sides of the line, it
was suggested that the foce be com­
posed of former soldiers of both coun­
tries under joint control, and that
the expense (be shared by both gov­
ernments.
Details of the plan have not been
worked out. In its favor it was
argued that the 'Mexican people
would not feel toward the constabu­
lary the same hostility that they dis
played toward the American troops,
which have crossed the line. II was
also suggested that the police force
would be far more effective in clear­
ing the mountains of northern 'Mex­
ico of bandits than either Mexican
or American troops have been.
The commission will adjourn to­
morrow, to permit the Mexican mem­
bers to celebrate the Mexican Inde­
pendence Day, September 16.

and Forefinger When Gun
Explodes
Charles E. Winchell of North Ad­
ams, Mass., wholesale grocer, a mem­
ber of Governor Hanna's hunting par­
ty at the Sam Clark ranch, 20 miles
north of Dawson, Wednesday lost
part of his left thumb and forefinger,
when the barrel of his gun exploded.
Part of his hand between his thumb
and forefinger was also torn off.
He was taken to Fargo for treat­
ment.
The accident occurred when he fir­
ed his first shot after arriving at
the ranch. He was sneaking up to a
flock of ducks and supposedly got
mud in the muzzle of his gun. When

Governor Manna left last night for
Fargo to see Mr. Winchell. He will
return today on No. 3 to the hunting

Husband of Woman Threatened
Her for Some Time No Trace
of Him To Date
Bemidji, Minn., Sept. 14.—iMrs. Wil­
liam Irving and her 5-year-old son
were found dead in their home near
Kelliher today, with bullet holes
through their heads. Although mys­
tery surrounds the double killing,
the authorities say they are of thei
opinion the case is that of murder
and suicide. A thorough search is
being conducted by tii$ police for the
father of the dead woman. Ho has
been living with his" daughter and
grandson during the absence of Wil­
liam Irving, husband of the dead wo­
man, who has been working in the
Dakota harvest fields.
Early this week Mrs. /Irving drove
into Kelliher and told a story of be­
ing threatened by her husband, who
wrote her, she said, and declared he
intended to marry another woman
and was coming homo to kill her and
their son. She asked the authorities
to protect, her. Her actions were so
strange that it was derided to take
her into custody. Last night Deputy
Sheriff O. 'M. Skinzik went to the
lonely home in an automobile, accom­
panied by the driver. When he ap­
proached the house someone inside
opened fire with a rifle. The automo­
bile was peppered by tiie shots. Tho
car stalled and the two men took
refuge behind it.
A few hours later Skinzik got his
car going, but decided to wait for
daylight before returning to the
house.
Returning, there was no answer to
his knocks, and together with au­
thorities who had come from Kelli­
her, he entered the -houfjq. The son
was. found lying inv
with a bullet hole through his head.
In the bedroom they found Mrs. Irv­
ing, dead, in a welter of blood. Near
her was a rifle.
Search was instituted Tor her fath­
er, but no trace of him could bo
found. Police incline to the theory
that he has been killed.
No one has seen the husband and
it is believed he is in North Dakota.
DR. MACLACHLAN RETURNS
EROM MEXICAN BORDER
Dr. T. M. MacLachlan returned
Wednesday night on No. 1 from Mer­
cedes, where he has been with offi­
cers and men of the First regiment,
N. D. N. G., for the past two months.
Dr MacLachlan has resigned his
commission as captain of the medical
corps of the regiment, and though
now on furlough, expects that his re­
signation will be acted upon in the
near future, thus relieving him. Dr.
MacLachlan requested his discharge
owing to the fact that he is needed
at home to care for his business,- and
as it looks as though the difficulty on
the border has been patched up, he
was of the opinion that his services
were no longer necessary on the
Mexican frontier.
Dr. MacLachlan states that the
boys of the North Dakota regiment,
are in the best of health, but more
or less anxious to get home.
W. A. Stickley has also applied for
a discharge and it is expected that
he will soon be back in Bismarck.

Businessmen Will Co-operate
in Effort To Settle Transit
Strike in Greater New York
New York, Sept. 14.—Representa­
tive business and professional men
late today offered to co-operate with
city officials, in an endeavor to settle
the transit strike which, for the past
seven days, has hampered transporta­
tion in Manhattan, the Bronx and
portions of Westchester county.
While James P. Holland, president of
the State Federation of Labor, was
telling 8,000 striking carmen and
their sympathizers, at a meeting In
Union Square after a parade, that
70,000 allied trade unionists would
strike Saturday unless a settlement
was effected in the meantime, Mayor

Chicago, Sept. 14.—Late returns

estimates, with the exception of the
probable nomination of Joseph O.

The late returns also strengthened

Only the official count, it was be

London, Sept. 14.—Beset by the
British on the west, and the French
on the east, the village of Combles,
in the Somme region of France, ap­
parently is on the verge of capture
by the Entente forces.
With the British firmly established
in the Leuze wood, less than a mile
to the east of it, they have driven
their wedge in farther and captured
Leiprez farm, through which runs the
road to Rancourt.
French Hold All Gains.
Along the Peronne-Bethune road
to the north and south of BouchaveB
nes, the Germans, according to Paris,
have vainly attacked the newly won
French positions in the hope of re­
gaining their transport line to the
north, but all their efforts have been
without success and the French have
maintained all their gains.
Except for reciprocal bombardment
and a slight advance by the French
by means of a bombarding attack
near Belloy-en-Santerre, south of the
Somme, the situation elsewhere on
the entire front in France and Bel­
gium remains unchanged.
The Teutonic allies are continuing
their advance on the Dobrudja Bee*
tor of .Roumania, according to .Berlin
and Sofia.
Roumanians Repulsed.
Across the mountains in Transyl­
vania the Roumanians have attacked
east and west of Hermannstadt,. but
were repulsed, says the Vienna war
office.
In the Carpathians, the Russians
attacked vigorously the forces of the
Central Powers at Smotrec, Ludova
and Kapul, storming positions after
heavy preparatory bombardments.
Their efforts to drive forward, how
ever, were stopped with sanguinary
losses, according to Vienna.
On the Macedonian front, consider*
able heavy fighting has taken place,
with the results beclouded, owing to
contradictory reports by the different
war chancellories.
Although it has been previously
stated that the Greek forts at Ka«
vala were evacuated by the Bulgari­
ans, Berlin says they are all in the
hands of the Bulgars and that the
Greek troopsj which were at Kavala
have been sent to Germany, where
they will remain until the end of the
war "in the status of neutrals."
In the Austro-Italian theatre the
usual bombardments continue.
