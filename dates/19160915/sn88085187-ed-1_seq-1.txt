SCENIC GEII DANGER
BY MABEL ABBOTT
AVliat would you think of a woman who, because she had a
great many jewels, would sit and look on indifferently while
somebody pried the golden setting off one of the finest, and
used it to make fillings for teeth?
You'd say she was crazy, probably.
Well, Tacoma is looking on Indifferently while the won
derful, irreplacable setting is pried off one of her finest jewels,
and used to make houses and barns and chicken coops.
Returning travelers bring word that a start toward logging
operations has been begun on the edge of Clear lake.
Clear lake is a little lake like a black pearl, on the original
stage road to Mount Tacoma, about five miles north of Katon
ville.
It is half v mile wide and three-fourths of a mile long, and
its surface is 250 feet above the Ohop valley.
It is a geological phenomenon, being 900 feet deep.
This Incredible depth is explained by some on the hypothe
sis that it Is an old crater.
However that may be. Clear Lake offers the loveliest view
of the mountain, rising; above its green-rimmed mirror, that is
to lie had from any lake in that region.
The timber around it is mostly fir and hemlock, and the
trees are dense and thrifty, not of enormous size or unusual
value commercially, but perfect from the standpoint of park pur-

WASHINGTON, D. C, Sept. 15.—How a 16-inch solid
steel shell tore straight through a ■ borne near the government
testing grounds at Indian Head, Maryland, passing through the
room adjoining that In which were a woman and her three
daughters, was reported to Washington today.
It was the first 16-incJi shell fever fired in the United
States.
Sailing from the mouth of the first 1 6-inch gun ever set up
In this country, the shell ripped through a thick section of
tough armor plate, thence through a huge bank of sand, and
tilting upward as a result of this resistance, described a mile
long arc through the air.
Mrs. Mary Swarm had just finished preparing the midday
meal for her husband, Wiliam O. Swarm—one of the men
Her two smallest children Had followed her Into the dln

There was a terrific roar Mu_-«rash. The house shook.
When she recovered from her'fright Mrs. Swarm went into
the kitchen. There were great gaping holes In opposite walls.
Outside the house lay tha huga mass of steel, still hot.
Little Essie Swarm, age 4, now uses the big steel cylinder
as a hobby horse, and her mother looks on, beaming at the

The frontage is clean, not muddy or reedy as many of the
lakes are.
The lake occupies the greater part of a section of land,
-which is owned by timber companies.
A logging road is now being built, some logs for construc
tion purposes bnving already been cut; and in a very short time,
iinie-..-, some way can be found to save It, Clear lake will be set,

f What can be done about It?
Well, the land and the timber belong to the men who
bought It, to be sure; but timber owners may be just as publlc
i#iii-ited as anybody else, and it doesn't seem Impossible that if
ft«y were asked to wait until some arrangement could be made
fa buy enough land to leave the lake undisturbed, or possibly to
get the State to trade them other land for it, since it is by no
means exclusively a Tacoma asset, they might prove entirely
V-llling to do, and might even meet the plan half way.
With a little time to call the attention of the people to the
fju-t that the timber around Clear lake is worth more to the city
and to the state standing than It is is in the form of lumber, there
are several things that might be done.
But every tree that falls is a loss that cannot be replaced
fcpr centuries; and whatever l#>done must be done quickly.
