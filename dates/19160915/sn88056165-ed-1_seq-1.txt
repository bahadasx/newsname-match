HELD ANOTHER
HOAD MEETING
Citizens From Ilo and Ferdi
nand Conferred With Local
People About Location ol
North and South Road.
Another good roads meeting
was held in our city last evening
when delegations of representa
tive citizens from Ilo and Ferdi
nand came over to talk state
highway with the local business
men. After the meeting with
State Engineer Booth at Grange
ville last week the word had gone
out that there was a possibility
of securing the survey for the lo
cation of the state highway
across the west side of Camas
prairie and the visitors last night
came for the purpose of talking
over various routes through the
Cottonwood and Ferdinand terri
tory and to Ilo and to arrange
for men at each town to receive
the engineer sent in to make the
survey and show him the best
routes through their respective
localities. After this is done it
will be up to the engineer and
state highway commission to
choose the best route and make
a permanent location survey of
the state road over such route.
The Ilo visitors included P. J.
Miller, R. M. Broker, Clyde Clo
vis, James McCorkle and H. C.
Netzel. Those from Ferdinand
were Joseph Bushue; B. C. Bar
bor and H. G. Sasse.
D H. Kube was in town yes
terday for the first time since his
accident last summer and was
receiving the hearty congratu
lations of his many friends on
his recovery from what seemed
for a time to be certain death.
Mr. Kube has the unique record
of almost coming back from the
grave, he having received a frac
tured neck as a result of being
thrown beneath a hay rake and
dragged for some distance by a
runaway team. After the acci
dent he lay for several days on a
bed with a heavy weight fastened
to his head to hold the neck
straight and later was operated
on by Dr. Gritman, of Moscow,
who set the fractured bone. Mr.
Kube has been at his home east
of town for several weeks and is
now practically recovered from
the effects of the accident and
operation, except that his neck
is still a little weak and stiff.
His escape was almost miracu
lous and he is feeling very grate
ful for getting off as luckily as
he did
George Sheldon was in town
yesterday from the Winona sec
tion.
Mrs. E. Christiansen, son and
daughter were in the city Wed
nesday from their home on the
Joseph.
Miss Agnes Gaul returned
Monday from Lewiston where
she has been for the past several
months.
The Forsmann-Trautman case
came up for trial Monday at
Grangeville and was continued
for the term on the showing that
an important witness was out of
the state and could not be secur
ed at this time.
The car of Dodge autos un
loaded here Saturday by the
Cottonwood Hardware company
was disposed of in • less than a
week. Three of the cars were
taken to Grangeville as soon as
unloaded, one went to Nezperce
the first of the week, and the re
maining two were purchased by
M. Kaschmitter and Andrew
Sprute. Another carload will be
shipped as soon as the order can
be filled.
Secure Better Motion Pictures
The motion picture "fans" of
Cottonwood and the west side of
the prairie are due to see some
exceptionally fine pictures during
the coming fall and winter
months, as the result of arrange
ments recently completed by the
management of the local play
house. At a meeting of the
managers of the motion picture
theatres of Camas and Nezperce
prairies recently held at Vollmer
an organization was perfected
and a contract signed whereby
the five houses will in future se
cure complete weekly programs
from the well known Mutual
Film company. This is the com
pany that has the exclusive out
put of Charlie Chaplin films, for
which it paid Chaplin the stupen
dous sum of $670,000 for a single
year's work. It is also nego
tiating for the release of the
celebrated Mary Pickford pro
ductions.
The new program will start in
the local theatre on Tuesday eve
ning, Sept. 26th, and after that
date films will be shown four
nights a week instead of three,
the show nights being each Tues
day, Thursday, Saturday and
Sunday! The new program will
start with the great serial, "The
Secret of the Submarine," said
to be one of the best serials on
the market and especially at
tractive at this time because of
the nation-wide interest in the
"preparedness" movement. With
this will be included two reels of
Vogue comedy, than which there
are none better being shown.
On Thursday nights a five reel
feature drama will be shown,
starting with such fine produc
tions as "Whispering Smith,"
"Medicine Bend," "Judith, of
the Cumberlands," "The Dia
mand Runners," "The Manager
of the B. & A," and similar pro
ductions. Saturday night's show
will consist of a well selected
mixed program and Sunday's will
have a nice assortment of drama
and high class comedy, with a
new release Chaplin comedy
every fourth Sunday. The first
Chaplin will be shown on Sunday,
Oct. 1st, and will probably be
"The Floorwalker."
Mutual programs are the kind
usually seen in the better grade
theatres in the large cities and
are seldom seen in smaller towns
because of their price being out
of reach, but a combination of
houses playing the same pro
grams, such as was recently ar
ranged for on the two prairies,
makes it possible to show these
great films on the prairie in fu
ture and at no advance over
former prices.
If the public appreciates the
best that can be obtained in mo
tion pictures, programs that are
always clean and above criticism
of any but the most prudish, the
same can be seen at the Orpheum
this fall.
Both the public and the man
agement of the theatre are for
tunate in securing such programs
as those above outlined.
Miss Ida Asker has accepted a
permanent position at Baker's
store.

E. Wimer, and other relatives.
There will be preaching ser
vices Sunday at the Methodist
church at 11 a. m. and 7:30 p. m
Rev. E. C. Newham, formerly oi
this place but lately of Oregon,
will preach. The public is cor
dially invited to attend both ser
vices.
SCHOOLS OPEN
FOR NEW TERM
Opening Enrollment Reaches
250 Mark and Will Go
Higher—Coming Year Prom
ises Great Progress.
The public school opened for
the new term Monday with a
full complement of instructors on
hand and an enrollment of about
100 students for the first week.
A sweeping change was made in
the teaching staff since last year
and only two of the former in
structors are back again at their
desks. Prof. J. P. Barackman,
who taught successfully for many
years in Latah county and was
employed for the past ten years
in the Moscow schools is super
intendent of the local school and
has as assistant principal Wm.
A. Lustie, of Seattle. Miss
Bertha Sloneker i s again i n
charge of the domestic science
department, while Mrs. De
coursey, of Lewiston, has charge
of the seventh and eighth grades.
Miss Fannie Me Grew, who has
taught here for a number of
years, is again in charge of the
fifth and sixth grades, and Miss
Ella Deerkop, of Palouse, pre-"
sides over the third and fourth
grades. Miss Delma Wilder, of
South Dakota, has charge of the
primary department.
The enrollment is quite large
for this early in the season and
after fall work is completed the
higher grades will be materially
strengthened by the presence of
many students who are now
compelled to occupy themselves
with harvest work on the farm.
Altogether, the coming term
promises to be a very successful
one for the school and material
progress should be made in all
departments.
At the local Catholic parochial
school 152 students were enrolled
the first week and it is expected
this number will be increased to
180 within the next few weeks,
thereby taxing the capacity of
the school to the limit. The in
structors this year are Sisters
Lucia, Hedwig, Thecla, Seraphine
and Anna, the latter being in
charge of the instruction in
music.
With almost 300 students en
rolled in the two schools Cotton
wood does not have to take a
back seat for any similar com
munity in the state when it comes
to efficiency in school work and
number of students enrolled.
The records of students from
both schools who have taken the
county examinations in the past
have been of a high class and
among the very best in the
county, a record of which we all
have reason to be very proud.
A. L. Creelman visited at his
home in Lewiston from Sunday
until Wednesday.
C. N. McLoughlin and family
departed this morning for Pull
man, Wash., where they will re
side during the winter and the
three older children will attend
the Washington State College.
The local Bell telephone office,
which has been so capably
handled by the Misses McLough
lin, will be looked after in future
by Miss Gentry and Myrtle Rhett.
Arthur Rice returned last week
from points in southern Idaho,
Utah and Wyoming where he has
been for the past year or so and
•vill assist his brother in operat
ing their father's large farm east
>f town. Arthur says Camas
orairie looks better to him than
all of the country he saw to the
south and he is now well satisfied
to remain here and grow up with
the country.
a
Plant 54,000 Trout
In Local Streams
m —
A shipment of 27 cans of na
tive brook trout, containing in
all 54,000 of the little fellows,
was received here last Friday eve
ning from the state fish hatchery
at Sandpoint and were planted
in streams in this locality that
night, the fish all being in the
water before midnight. G. W.
Phillips, Fred Lange, T. A. Ran
dall and Frank Schober were re
sponsible for getting the fish
here, they having made applica
tion for the young fry several
months ago. This number
turned loose in the creeks of this
locality will mean some good
fishing here in a year or two and
the plan of planting fish should
be continued each year so as to
keep the streams well stocked.
With the amount of fishing that
is done here it does not take long
to deplete a stream unless it is
stocked anew each season.
"Dad" Lyons Gets a Nickle
"Dad" Lyons has a five cent
piece which he declares he will
always keep and which he will
not give up for love nor money.
It came into his possession in the
following manner:
One day last week "Dad" was
sitting on a box in front of one of
the main street stores and had
taken off his hat to scratch his
head. A stranger passed by and
mistook "Dad" for a blind man.
He paused and reaching into his
pocket dropped a nickle in
"Dad's" hat, who was too as
tonished for a moment to correct
the mistake and upon reflection
considered it a good joke and de
cid.d to keep the coin for a good
luck piece. — Bonners Ferry
Herald.
The above sounds all right, but
many of "Dad's" old pals herea
bouts will be loath to believe he
was not fishing for a sucker and
caught one.
Build New Tile Block Garage
Ground was broken Wednes
day for a new two story tile
block building to be erected on
the S. J. Peterson lots just west
of the Phoenix hotel and active
work on the building will soon be
in progress. Mr. Peterson let
the contract this week for the
building, which is to be 52x100
feet in size and two stories in
height. The foundation and
lower floor will be of solid con
crete and the walls constructed
of tile block and it is the aim of
Mr. Peterson to have the build
ing completed at as early a date
as possible. The building will be
occupied by C. W. Thompson as
a garage and will be so arranged
that cars can be run onto the
second floor from the alley at the
rear. We are informed Mr.
Thompson will give his entire at
tention to auto repair work after
moving into the new building
and will equip it with a first class
outfit of machinery and keep an
expert repair man employed at
all times.
The new building will add ma
terially to the appearance of
Main street and a first class gar
age will be a valuable acquisition
to our city, as the auto business
in this section is rapidly becoming
of large dimensions.
Mr. Peterson secured twenty
feet from the hotel frontage in
order to give his building proper
dimensions and the structure will
be quite a sightly one when
completed. We understand the
building will cost in the neigh
borhood of $8,000.
Miss Ruth Giezeker came up
from Lewiston Wednesday and
has a nice line of fall millinery
now on display at the Goldstone,

Several Indians are hauling
grain into town these days with
good looking four-horse teams
and appear almost as capable
farmers as many of their white
brethern. The Indians have
adopted civilized methods quite
generally during the past twenty
years and many of the more pro
gressive have realized the ne
cessity of getting down to the
white man's methods and learn
ing how to work and save for
themselves before the time came
for the government to turn them
loose on their own responsibility.
As a result there are a number of
Indians in central Idaho who are
able to farm their lands and look
after their business affairs in
first class manner ,
