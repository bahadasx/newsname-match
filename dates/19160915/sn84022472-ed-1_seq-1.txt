New Plague Case
Local customers of quick cuisine
may be treated to a carnival of crock
ery cracking if the plans of Chief
Inspector C. Howard Dunbar are car
ried out. Backed by the health de
partment Mr. Dunbar proposes to
complete the Job "whenever he or his
Inspectors find a cracked cup, saucer
or plate In. & lunch room.1
s Mr. Dunbar . maintains that cracks
in cups, etc,- are congested .tenements
for germs. . Jn fact, he believes, if
there is one place a germ likes to eke
out his existence after a bottle of
milk, it Is in the cracks of dishes.
The feminine germs especially find
oscillatory advantage in a location at
the rim of a coffee cup. .
The inspectors will set out on this
mission tomorrow and also will begin
checking, up on the results of a notice
that will reach 15 restaurants in the
morning. ' The notice contains a copy
of an ordinance relative to the com
mon use of drinking cups. j
or similar article may be exposed for
public use in , any place unless it has
been thoroughly , cleaned and steriliz
ed. A fine of not exceeding $25 is
provided, x. -- . N
-It is expected the . ordinance will
have effect of - eliminating the1, possi
bility of persons using an unwashed
glass at a water stand or fountain
in a restaurant It is expected either
sanitary k cups will be provided or
waiters will supply diners with a glass
or cup- mat au own sieriiizvu. ,
Chief Inspector Dunbar has compil
ed a list of approximate figures for
the work done by the new force of
Inspectors since Dr. Abraham Sophian
instituted his campaign here .about
July 13.' Under the guidance of Dr.
Sophian the inspectors caused im
provements to be made In tenements,
lodging houses,., saloons, ice cream
parlors, stables cesspools, etc.
Of about 650 tenements examined
by i the Inspectors, 262 are now re
ported O. K. The changes included
Improvements in light, toMet facilities
and sleeping arrangements. In some
overcrowded places, some of the lat
est cornerswere' ordered out. . It is
not known whether or not they have
remained out because there has been
no relnspection. . ' '
Ot 310 saloons inspected and given
orders, only four or five have failed
to comply. . Of about 200 ice cream
parlors, nearly alt have complied with
the orders. Where running water was
not Installed as ordered, sanitary" cups
have been adopted. ' ' v ' -Thirty-two
cesspools were cleanea
or reconstructed, theatres were found
generally good. Three squads, one
north of Fairfield avenue, one south,

assigned to see that manure is not al

EXAMINEHOOSING
IN OTHER CITIES
OF NEW ENGLAND
Bridgeport Planners . Get
ting Ideas From Duelling
Plants of East,
Comparative examination of big
municipal and industrial communi
ties has ben begun by the heads jot
the Bridgeport Housing Co. that the
defects of previous projectors may be
overcome and Bridgeport be assured
of the highest type of houses consist
ent' with prevailing wage scales. .
General Manager of the Bidgeport
Housing Co. Frederick C. Blanchard,
following a. trip through the larger
cities of Massachusetts today reported
his impressions on various private and
co-operative, developments to a full
meeting of the board of directors of
the company. . "
As a 'result of his visit to 'these
cities it has been determined that
many of the previous projects were
either fostered on a scale too high for
Bridgeport lacked the exterior beau
tification necessary to make them ifer-
fmanently attractive as rents, in this
city, or were of types of construction
Inadequate for Park City needs. :
The cities visited were Salem, Ja
maica Plain, Boston, Hopedale and
Worcester, , Mass. Another trip
through the famous garden spots of
Long Island and 4icw . York will be
visited by Blanchard next week.,
To have intimate control of the de-f
tails of building for the Bridgeport
Housing Co. this building committee
was appointed today to act in con
junction with the general manager:
George M. Eames, Samuel L. Hawley
and David S. Day- It is understood
that under thetr direction the types of
houses to be erected, the, general con
struction work and purchase of ma
terials needed will be planned.
-,In . the detailed i report submitted
today by Blanchard it would appear
that the great number of Massachu
setts building projects lacked that ex
terior attractiveness consistent with
cheapness of rental or sale value. The
plainness of exterior in some of "the
industrial construction work was such
that it caused employes forced to
live in the houses to seek work in
other cities. ' ,. On the other hand,
Jamaica Plain, near Boston, a type of
houses was found where rentals were
so high as to be prohibitive in Bridge
port. Properties of the Naumkeag
Cotton Co, at Salem, Mass., of frame'
and stucco, were found to be of the
banned four family type. The
Charles River apartments in Boston
were too high class. The Draper
Co.'s buildings at Hopedale, Mass.,
housing about 400 families,' were
found desirable from an architectural
standpoint. The Norton Grinding
Co.'s housing at Worcester was admir
ably located and though the, houses
are small'' may be considered ia future
plans of the local company.. -
