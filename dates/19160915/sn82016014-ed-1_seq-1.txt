The racing card this afternoon is by

various stages of the work. First, the
tire boss enters the mine in the morn

work. The fire boss comes out and
writes on a bulletin board the exact
condition of the mine, thus acquaint

may exist.
Next the miners march into the
mine remaining a few moments,
which is to represent a days' work.

DANK PLOT FAILS
Psendo French Count in Bole
of Arch Swindler.
Attempt at Half Million Swin
dle Ends in Jail.
Chicago, Sept. 15. Details of what
is said to have been an elaborate plot
to swindle seventeen ' banks in the
United States out of an amount esti
mated at between $300,000 and $500,-
000 were made public here today. At
the same time it was said a detective
would leave Chicago for Gotlenburg,
Sweden, armed with extradition pa
pers for Karl von Bardi, wanted in
connection with the alleged plot.
Von Bardi, according to the Swed
ish authorities here, has been lan
guishing in a Gotlenburg jail since
last May, when he was captured on
a wireless message on a charge of
having forged checks for $3,000 in
the name of a local varnish manufac
turing company. Altho the Swedish
authorities have refused to extradite
him they have also refused to release
him from jail.
According to the police von Bardi
assumed in Chicago the name of a
French count. Here and in other
American cities, he worked for five
years in one bank after another, fa
miliarizing himself, it is said, with
the bank officials' signatures and
gathering a supply of stationery and
blank forms

Fairbanks Had Better Ac-

But, at That, the Kansas Kick
Wasn't Quite There.
Kansas took a look at the Fairbanks
personality this week ar.d in speeches
thru the Second congressional district,
the Republican vice presidential can
didate left an impression that will
doubtless have a better effect on elec
tion results than efforts of former
campaign speakers. It was Fairbanks
first visit to the state since 1904. At
times during his Kansas trip, Fair
banks was really on chummy relations
with his audience, made votes in cer
tain localities and said nothing that
drove anyone out of the party.
At Baldwin the" Republican candi
date pulled the smartest politics ex
hibited in Kansas this year. He stood
under an elm tree, permitted himself
to be the tireless object of an amateur
photographer, displayed to rah rah
boys and girls a watch fob given him
by Baker students in 1901, talked
Methodist gospel in the college chapel
and sprinkled his remarks with po
litical poison that caught the crowd
flat footed. It was the best display of
warmth and personality that Fair
banks exhibited in the state and his
Baldwin effort was easily worth the
trip.
Sharp ISemarks.
Fairbanks is this year injecting real
sharp, caustic remarks in his speeches.
In the course of a forty-minute talk
he delivers a dozen rough indictments
against the Democratic national ad
ministration. To be sure, it hasn't
the punch and kick that characterizes
a speech in the Simon pure home
made Kansas language, but it is there
just the same and not a few of the
people in the Kansas crowds found the
right place to applaud.
"We are so profoundly and adverse

Mexico City, Sept. 15. Mexico is
about to resume her place among the
republics of the western hemisphere
after four years of revolutionary dis
turbances.
A decree issued by General Carranza
on the eve of the celebration of the
anniversary of Mexican independence
prepares the way for the present de
facto government to be replaced by a
substantial constitutional government.
The decree calls for a revision of sev
eral articles of the Plan of Guadalupe.
.drawn up on December 12, 1914, and
makes provision for the election of
members of a national congress.
Another decree will be issued to
morrow, calling for election of a con
stitutional congress on October 15.
The first session of the new congress
will be held November 20, probably at
Coyoacan, a suburb of Mexico City.
Two From Kach State.
The decree issued last night provides
that each state and territory shall
elect a deputy to congress and a sub
deputy for every 70.000 inhabitants,
and an additional deputy if the frac
tion above 70,000 exceeds two-sevenths
of that number. Any state or terri
tory not having 70.000 inhabitants is
entitled to elect a deputy and sub-deputy
also. The eligibility requirements
are the same as those provided in the
election of 1887.
Those who opposed the constitu
tional government with arms will be
ineligible to hold office.

DIPS ARE DORMANT
Other Lawbreakers Xot Bother
ing Topeka Very Much.
Despite Mammoth Crowds Only
2 Arrests This lVeek.
With thousands of outsiders in To
peka since Monday morning the police
docket shows only twenty-six arrests
since midnight Sunday night. Nine of
these are for "investigation." Suspi
cious looking individuals were picked
up and held until their records could
be looked up.
"I never saw anything like it," said
Ed Woodruff, veteran jailer. "We
used to have the jail full when there
was a big crowd in town. This week
we have had less to do than ordin
arily." Harvey Parsons, chief of police, fol
lowed a different system this year.
The week before the fair he rounded
up all of the known law violators and
put them in jail for vagrancy. They
were convicted almost without excep
tion and were forced to give bonds to
appeal their cases. With a district
court staring them in the face they
have been careful during the state
fair.
RAISE AD PRICES
Advertising Instructor Explains
Necessity to Editors.
Says Advance in Ad and Sub
scription Rates or Ruin.
Kansas City, Mo., Sept. 15. Higher
prices for subscriptions and for adver
tising in the newspaper field were
advocated here today by J. D. Powell,
instructor in advertising of the school
of journalism of the University of
Missouri at Columbia. He was speak
ing at the annual meeting of the Mis
souri Press association.
"The newspaper publisher, who
does not increase his subscription
price and his advertising rates in
common with the upward trend of
prices for practically all commodities
that enter into the production of a
newspaper, is quite likely to be facing
ruin in another year," he said. Then
he quoted figures tending to show
that almost every article used in news
paper production has either doubled
or quadrupled in the last year.
te said that not more than a dozen
of the leading newspapers in the coun
try, however, had increased their
prices and that he had heard of none
at all in the country field that had
done so. Mr. Powell also discussed
the relation of the advertiser and the
European war.
Liquidations Sure to Follow.
"We are living in a time of war
and we should prepare for peace." he
said. "Some day the war will end. It
may be soon, it may be late, but from
now until peace is declared, business
men have an opportunity to insure
their business against the future by
advertising. The retailer especially
should entrench himself with such
service and . advertising that he will
be able to hold his customers against
the inevitable bargain snd liquidation
that are certain to follow this artifi
cially produced prosperity."
Mr. Powell said that an increase in
advertising rates vould be a benefit
to the public because it would tend
to eliminate "adventures with little
capital, who, unknown to the average
puonsner. seen to exploit questionable
merchandise thru newspaper adver
tising" and that it would cause more
faith to be placed in the announce
ments of reputable firms.
Hundreds of daily and weekly
newspapers in the country have ad
vanced their advertising and subscrip
tion prices; there have been many
consolidations and suspensions due to
the advancement of prices in the raw
material from 100 to 200 per cent.
There must be many curtailments and
more increases in rates or bank
ruptcies will ensue.)

seven hundred firemen, comprising
delegations, authorized representatives
or chiefs, from eighty-six Kansas cities
and towns are here attending: the
twenty-ninth annual convention.
More are coming. By tomorrow,
the day of the tournament in the fair
grounds, the attendance may easily
jump to more than a thousand.
Business Session.
Today's program of the convention
opened this morning with the business
session in the commercial club rooms.
Addresses by Mohrbacher. J. H. John
son, engineer in the fire marshal's de
partment; and an address by 1. T.
Hussey, state fire marshal, was sched
uled shortly before noon.
"I presume,' said Mr, Mohrbacher,
in beginning, "that there are chiefs
here who have probably had theiir
share of grief in trying to show their
respective administrations the need
and necessity of better equipment in
their departments. The 'bugaboo of
high taxes' is invariably held up to
prominence and the customary 'watch
dog of the treasury gets busy. The
old time cry of keeping the taxes
down has been used until it has be
come a fort of a joke and if the party
who has been elected to any public
position on a platform of this nature
has succeeded in cutting down ex
penses without a serious handicap to
his constituency or depriving the pub
lic of certain improvements and effi
ciency which they demand and re
quire, the case has so far escaped my
notice.
"We are living in a day of progres
siveness and the 'cost of high living
is a nightmare as it were we buy the
best that can be had for our own per
sonal use we eat as much bacon at
30 cents a pound as we did when it
was three for a quarter we ride in
anything from a Ford to a llmosuin
nothing but strictly modern houses
will answer any longer the day nf
the oil grain plow shoe and the split
leather boot has been forgotten, in
fact, there's hardly an item or a line
but what we not only ask but absolute
ly demand something better. But I am
sorry to say that in too many instances
in Kansas the 'City Dads' have not
'seen the light' as to fire department
equipment and departments are ex
pected to get along with what was
purchased when the town was per
haps one-half or one-fourth the size.
And why all to keep the taxes down."
At this time when we speak of bet
ter equipment in a fire department in
a small town we naturally think of
motor equipment, either a combination.
truck where waterworks have been
installed or for a motor chemical in
the smaller towns without water
works, and why? Because the ex
perimental stage of motor equipment
has long since passed the auto has
come to stay and factories and inven
tors are vielng with each other to
reach the stage of perfection as near
as possible. The excuse out no bv
those who oppose the motor equipment
on account of impracticability in mud
dy weather or deep enow is indeed a
lame one. True, there are times when
it might be impossible to reach a fire
on account of exceptional enow or mud
conditions but in such cases it would
be Just as impossible to get there with
any kind of apparatus. While a motor
truck will of course give better sen -ice
on paved streets than on dirt
streets, yet a paved street is not abso
lutely necessary for the successful
operation of it, and there is as much
reason in condemning a motor truck
on these grounds as there would be
not to put up any more buildings in
the city because some of them had
burned down at some time or other.
Brother firemen, these statements are
not made by me simply because I favor
and advocate the motorizing of fire
apparatus, but because I know they
are true and the citing- of a few in
stances will bear out my statement.
"In conclusion, I say in all sincerity
that there is no reasonable excuse for
departments in small towns not hav
ing uener equipment, and by better
equipment I mean motor equipment. I
hope that in a few years we will be
able to say that 56 or 75 per cent of
the fire departments will have been
motorized.
"Then and not till then can we ex
pect a cutting down of our insurance
iates."
