FIRE DESTROYS LINER.
Pa*e*ng*r* Reaoued From Burning
Paoifio 8t*am*hip Congress.
Marshfleld, Ore., Sept. 15.—Wrapped
In flames, the Pacific coast liner Con
gress stands two miles off Coos Bay
after a thrilling race. to land Its 253
passengers and crew of 170.
The fatf of those on board has not
been definitely determined, but it is
believed that all have been rescued
•by the Colonel P. S. Michie, a bar
dredge.
The Michie went to sea in answer
to an S. O. S. and was accompanied
by the steamer Tillamook. The Michie
and Tillamook are reported coming In,
and this is taken to mean that all the
passengers have been rescued.
Life savefrs and boats from the
Michie had been working for nearly
an hour. Six lifeboats were used in
the rescue.
The lighthouse keeper reported that
when the first life boat was lowered
decks and bow of the Congress
were crowded with frantic passengers.
The smoke was so dense that the ship
could not be seen at times.
The first call for assistance was re
ceived here about 4 o'clock. Fire had
been discovered on the Congress in
hold No. 3. While ships here were be
ing .prepared for a dash to the rescue,
the Congress made for Marshfleld. The
liner then was some distance out.
At 6 o'clock flames broke out amid
ships.
When the Congress first came within
sight of -the lighthouse black smoke
was pouring out of the vessel, but no
flames were visible from shore. Now
the sky is red from the. burning ship.
EXONERATE PRISONER.
Youth Sentenced .For Life Absolved by
Mulholland and Waltonen.
New York. Sept. 15.—With the con
fession of Joseph Mulholland of the
part he and three other men played
in the murder of Mrs. KUzabeth Nich
ols, aged wealthy widow, a year ago,
another chapter was added to New
York's remarkable record of convic
tions in whlch-every effort is now .be
ing made to show that innocent men
were sentenced to death or life im
prisonment.
The confessions of Mulholland and
Arthur Waltonen, arrested in Iron
wood, Mich., absolve Onnl Talaf from
actual participation in the murder of
Mrs. Nichols. But Talas, a mere youth,
is now In Sing Sing, sentenced to life
Imprisonment. Another man iropli
caXfA is still at large.
Mulholland and Waltonen told how
they tried .to get Talas to kill the
wealthy, widow, but he was afraid.
They then overpowered and bound him
and rushed to Mrs. Nichols' room, they
said. On feeing them, she fell back
dead of fright, they declare.

SWEDEN HELD
NOT NEUTRAL
Entente Allies to Join in
Protest Against Policy
Towards Shipping*
ATTITUDE TOWARDS
"SUBS" AGGRAVATES
Sweden Holding Up Shipment of Cof
fee in Retaliation Against Great
Britain—Germany to Care For Ma
rooned Greek Army—Entire Corps
to Be He'd as Neutrals—Pitiable
Paris, Sept. 16.—The French gov
ernment has instructed the minister at
Stockholm to join with the other en
tente ministers in presenting a firm
note to Sweden in regard to its policy
of neutrality. The note takes Issue
in the opposition of Sweden in dis
tinguishing between submarines of
war and those of commerce, which the
entente affirms has an effect contrary
to neutrality, since the Swedish naval
forces would hesitate to attack a Ger
man submarine in Swedish waters
under the, pretext that it might be a
merchant submarine, whereas it would
not hesitate to attack an allied sub
marine, since the allies have no mer
chant submarines.
The attitude of Sweden has caused
difficulties with the allies, following
the blockade of Germany, resulting in
the holding up of goods en route to
Sweden, suspected of being destined
for Germany. Sweden retaliated by
holding up parcel post matters in
transit between Kngland and Russia.
This led to an exchange of notes which
accomplished nothingr and early this
month a deadlock was reached. Great
Britain insisted as a condition to sub
mitting the dispute to arbitration' that
Sweden must promise not to interfere
again with British mall matters.
Sweden declined. Negotiations were
transferred to Stockholm but latest
advices from London indicate that no
solution of the problem was in sight.
Sweden Seizes Coffee.
Berlin, Sept. 15.—A Stockholm dis
patch says that Sweden has held up
10,000 pounds of coffee destined for
England, presumably because Great
Britain has held up coffee destined for

GREEKS TVCKEN TO SrER"MANY.
Army Corps Cut'Off Fr^m .Athens to
Be Treated a* Neutrals.
Berlin, Sept. lo.—The Vosslsche
Zeitung says that the officers of the
Fourth Greek army corps, which is to
be transported from Kavala. Greece, to
Germany, will be accompanied by their
families, "thus preventing the starving
women and children by the entente."
[Official announcement was made
yesterday of the plan to transport., to
Germany Greek troops stationed at
Kavala. The announcement said the
troops cut. off from communication
with Athene by the entente forces were
suffering from disease and lack of
food and that they would be taken to
Germany as neutrals. Athens dis
patches said 1,500 Greek soldiers had
been removed from Kavala on war
ships of the allies.]
Pitiable Condition of Refugee*.
Athens, Sept. 13. via London, Sept.
15. [Delayed]—The Marasarete."' the
boat in which Baron von Schenk. head
of the German propaganda in Greece
was sent to Kavala, to be turned over
to the Bulgarians, arrived this after
noon with 1,000 refugees, who were in
the most pitiable condition. They had
been without food since Sunday and
were packed in the ship like sardines.
The refugees said that a German aero
plane had dropped three bombs as the
boat was leaving Kavala, which came
within a few inches of striking the
ship.
An eye witness who described the
entry of-thp Bulgarians into Kavala on
Monday said that three Greek regi
ments which had remained in the town
were given until 10 o'clock Tuesday
morning ^o surrender as prisoners of
war. At the expiration of this ulti
matum they gave up their arms and
were taken up country.
Terrible conditions were described
on the island of Thasos. where 7.000
refugees had fled from the invaders in
row boats and sail boats. 'They lacked
every necessity of life and rreat num
bers of women and children were
camped out In the open without fpod.
The refugees said that disorder reigned
in Kavala where bandits were looting
the houses and all the Greeks who
could were taking refuge in flight.
They said only three of four Ameri
cans remained in .the town, the others
having gone to Thasos.
MORE SHIPPING RESTRICTIONS.
Great Britain Takes 8t*p* to Pr*v*nt

London, Sept. 16.—The plan of ra
tioning the neutral countries.- of Nor
way. Sweden, Denmark and Holland,
nnder which no further licenses wiH
be granted for the present .to British
exporters, has been extended to ap
ply to the United States by the exr
pedient of refusing to allow the Neth

and declining to grant letters of as
surance for shipments destined for
these countries. In consequence Am

stopped, while the countries trading
between the United States jtnd Scan

definite information about their ulti

reasons induced the British govern

growing bill with which Great Britain

ments ifor demurrage and other ex
penses Incurred by taking suspected
ships Into Kirkwall and other ports for
examination.
Another blockade measure Is the
recent arrangement under which
bureaus were set up in England *nd
France for granting licensee for ex
change of goods which figure on the
list of prohibited Imports. The Am
erican authorities contend that under
the British American commercial
treaty of IMS such prohibitions .liust
be enforced equally against all coun
tries. Consequently any privileges
granted to France and not extended to
the United States are held to be in
violation of that treaty.

Long Branch. N. J.. Sept. 15.—Presi
dent Wilson decided today to take ad
vantage of the earliest possible oppor
tunity to challenge the statements made
by Charles E. Hughes in recent
speeches that the basis on which the
settlement of the threatened railroad
strike was made was merely an In
crease of wages for employes.
The president, it was said, will hold
the principle of an eight-hour day was
vitally affected by the strike settlement,
and will seek to show that while the
railroad legislation passed by congress
to meet the situation will give the em
ployes at least a temporary increase in
pay, the more important point Is that
it will establish the eight-hour day as
a basis of work for railroad employes.
Mr, Wilson expects to make clear
that he will not be satisfied until con
ress enacts into the law the rest of
the railroad legislation he recommended
when the strike was threatened, in
cludlns the increase in the Interstate
commerce commission and an investi
gation of ^differences between railways
or
and tlieir^employes before strikes
lockouts are called.
President Wilson received word to
day that his sister, .Mrs. Anna E. Howe,
who is ill at New London, Conn., was
sinking rapidly. Tentative plans were
made Immediately for his departure for
New London later today.
