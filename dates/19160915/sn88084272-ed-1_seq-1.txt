Declares . Administration
Has Given United States
Many Worthy Laws.
Tucson. Ariz.. Sept la Praise for
the administration of Woodrow Wil
son was voiced here Thursday night
by William J. Bryan, former secretary
of state, in the presence of about 3000
people. He declared there had not
been an administration in the history
of the United States in which so much
remedial legislation had been accom
plished This legislation he enumer
ated as Including the Underwood tariff
law, "the best framed in 30 years." th
income tax. which he pointed out was
favored by Wilson as governor of New
Jersey and opposed by Hughes as gov
ernor of New Tork. Mr Bryan also
praised the currency law. the child
labor law. the rural credits and other
measures:
Speaking of the peace treaties signed
while he was secretary of state Mr.
Bryan declared that they were a large
step in the direction of international
peace and that hi name would be
linked with Wilson's in the history of
world peace His eloquent appeal of
the president's refusal to recognize
Huerta and his dennnciation of thos"
who favor Intervention in Mexico were
enthusiastically applauded.
Following his speech. Mr Bran was
interrogated b Miss Helen Todd and
Mrs St. Clair Thompson, organizers of
the woman's party, who told him: "We
are Democrats, but we feel obliged tj
oppose Mr Wilson for his stand on
woman suffrage" Mr. Brian assured
them that Mr. Wilson was a real friend
of woman suffrage and pointed out
that
personal opinion and does not control
his iarty." He also pointed out that
while the Republican platform "leaves'
the suffrage Issue to the states, the
Democratic platform "recommends ' it
to the states for faorable action.

EW LONDON. CONN.. Sept. 15.
Practical obstacles have arisen
the consideration by the
American-Mex'ian Joint commission of
numerous suggestions for the pacifica
tion of the border which makes it sem
improbable at this time that any agree
ment can be formulated without pro
longed discussion
Maj Gen. T.i-ker H Bliss, assistant
chief of staff of the army, was before
the commission today to point out ob
jections that can be raised to many of
the proposals, including that of an in
ternational constabulary to relieve the
military forces of both countries of the
border patrol work they are now doing
The commission held only a brief ses
sion, the Mexican party planning to
leae tor New York todav to attend the
.celebration there tomorrow of Mexico's
national noiiaay, commemorating the
declaration of her independence and tin
throwing off of Spanish rule. They will
return Monday when the conferences
i w ill be resumed.
Patrols Of Former Vildlerw.
! It has indicated that the border
, patrol proposal which has appealed
, most strongly to the commissioners
was that a border constabulary bo
created to operate as a police force
along both sides of the line. It was
suggested that the force be composed
of former soldiers of both countries,
under Joint control, and that the ex
pense be shared by both governments.
It was argued that the Mexican
people would not feel toward the con
stabulary the same hostility that they
displayed toward the American troops.
It also was suggested that the police
force would be far mere effective m
clearing the mountains of northern
Mexico of bandits.
SAYS MEXICAN TROUBLES
START ON TEXAS SIDE
Omaha. Nebt, Sept. 15. "From my
observation and conversations with
army officers and others on the Mex
ican border. I am convinced that most
of the trouble there originated on this
side of the boundary," said Rev. John
F. Poucher. captain and adjutant of
the Fourth Nebraska infantry, who re
turned home Thursday- night on a fur
lough. The trouble is mostly over wages
and the treatment of Mexican laborers
by land owners on the American side
This land was formerly Mexican terri
tory and the Mexicans who hive been
forced off the land on which they have
lived from time immemorial resent
the treatment they receive. It is
tlaimed Mexican laborers are treated
little better than slaves and when they
revolt are shot down without com

Neutral diplomats here believe two
reasons induced the British government
to take this action. The first is the
simplicity of the plan, which enables
