Mr. Thos. 0. Luster,
Editor, The Outlook,
Cnrrizozo, N. M.
Dear Sir:
It is the duty of every Ameri
can citizen to make and support
openly his choice among tho
candidates for tho Presidency
That duty is especially solemn
this year because great events
and great decls'ons are certain to
confront us during tho next ad
ministration. I am writing to
irivf! von mv reasons for my own
choice. If you care to lay the m
beforo your readers, please do so,
but not before Monday morning,
September 11.
I am neither n Democrat nor a
Republican, but a progressive.
Yet, there being no progressive
nominee, unless I choose to sup
port n candidate who can not be
elected, I must vote for either
Wilson or Hughes.
For many months after his
inauguration, I thought well of
President Wilson. In many re
spects I liked what he said about
what he was going to do. Ho
talked well and made a good im
pression. It was only when I
began to check up what he said
by what ho did that I was forced
to change my view.
In the end 1 came to see that
President Wilson has a greater
power than any other man in
public life to say one thing but do
another, and get away with it.
The fncts which justify this
statement nre common knowledge
We have all heard him tell
Germany publicly that sho would
be held to strict accountability;
and have learned afterward that
he had actually let her know
secretly at the time, by tho
mouth of his Secretary of State
through the Austrian Ambassa
dor, that what he said he did
not mean. Wo have all soen him
move that he did not menu it by
l(is total failure uo exact repara
tion, ajwlogy, or ovon disavowal
for the murder of the Americans
on tho Lusltnnia.
1 do not say that Wilson should
havo thrust us into war. There
was no need of war. Hut there
was nood of courage to give us
pouco with solf-rospect. If Wil
son had shown courage this
oountry would not have skidded
from one crisis to the noxt, again
ami again narrowly escaping
disaster.
Wo have all hoard him declare
titfitihst intervention in Mexico,
while actually intervening to
diítátü who should and who
should not hold ollicc there; and
denounce war against Mexico
co wlijie actually engaged in wnr.
With war on every side of us,
wc nil heard him, in his second
annual message, solemnly assure
the country that wo had not been
negligent of Nntionnl defense.
It was not true; and later on he
himself proved thnt it was not
true by proclaiming aloud the
need for what ho had solemly
assured us we already had.
For more than a year after
tho world-war began, Wilson
did not raise a finger to put us in
a condition of defense. Only
tho proverbial good luck of
America has kept us from paying
tho bitterest price for his unfor
givable neglect. Wo have all
heard him ridicule the idea of a
greater navy, then declnro for
incomparably tho greatest navy
in the world, and then go back
on that.
Wo have all heard him declare
for exempting our coast-wise
trade from tolls in the Panama
Canal; and have seen him show
our own people and the English
that he did not mean it.
Wc have seen him elected on a
platform which pledged him to a
singlo term as President, and
then become n candidate for
another term.
Wo have all heard him declare
for the Conservation of our nat
ural resources, and have seen
him neglect that policy, and re
fuse his help to defeat the Shields
waterpower bills, tho most dnng
erous attack on Conservation
sinco Ballinger's effort to turn
Alaska over to the Guggcnheims
We have all heard him declare
for efficiency in Government,
nnd have seen him set the pork
barrel and throw efficiency away.
I have known official Washington
from tho inside for six Adminis
trations. In that time the Gover
nment business has never been so
badly done and so extravagantly
as it is now done under Wilson.
We havo all heard him announce
himself as the chnmnion of Civil
Service reform; and hnve seen
him turn the Government De
partments over to the spoilsmen
as no other President hns done in
twenty years.
We have all heard him declare
for pitiless publicity; and have
seen him conduct the most secret
administration of our time.
Wc have all heard him announce
himself as President of all the
people, and have seen him, ns the
most partisan President of his
generation, flout and oppose the
Progressives, whom now, because
he needs them, he seeks to con
ciliate and enlist.
Worst of all is this: When
every principle of freedom and
equality for which our father's
fought was at stake in the great
war, whon our whole country
eagerly awaited tho leadership of
the President, Wilson dodged.
He rofusod to take sides on the
greatest moral issuo of our time.
He advised our people to bo
"neutral even in thought," un
decided botweon right and wrong
While our friends abroad were
fighting for the principles we
hold equally with them, he
taught us that profits nnd ease
wore better tliun self-respect.
President Wilson has done our
Nation the most serious injury
that any lender can do to any
people by making us ilinch with
him from u great moral decision.
Thereby ho weakened our hold as
a nation on the principles which
alono can make any people self
respecting, safe and Btrong.
Having led us wrong on the
ground that we must bo neutral
in tho face of tho deliberane
breaking of the world's nonce, he
has just reversed himself again,
nnd in his speech at Shadow
Lawn now assures us tliut "No

E. W. HULBERT FOR
COUNTY CLERK
Highly Respected and Hon
orable Citizen is Seeking
Nomination on Republican
Ticket for County Clerk
HAS A POLITICAL RECORD
ABOVE REPROACH
E. W. Hulbcrt is this week an
nouncing for County Clerk and
tho voters will welcomo tho chan
co to support a man who hus a lor g
line of efficient public service
to his credit and is n citizen who
is a credit to his county. Mr.
Hulbert is a native of Kansas,
having been born at Fort Scott
Some twenty-five years ago lie
removed to Lincoln County and
established his residence at White
Oaks where he engaged in the
practice of law, and was actively
connected with many of the
flourishing interests of that time
when White Oaks was tho busi
est placo in the Southwest.
Later he moved to Lincoln where
lie has resided ever since. Short
ly after his coming to Lincoln he
was elected Treasurer and Ex
officio Collector of the County.
He discharged the duties connect
ed with this office in a thoioughly
capnble and satisfactory manner
and mado himself u place in the
hearts of tho taxpayers during
the time he served in this respons
ible plnco. Later he served v (th
credit as county commissioner
much constructive work being
done as a result. He has been
closely allied with county politics
all these years, especially doing
much work in tho office of county
clerk, which wüb placed in his
charge at various times. He has
alsp served as a district court
clerk. Thus lie knows tho work
ings of the county's business from
actual contact and aspires with
reason to the office for which ho
announces his candidacy this
week. Moreover ho has boon an
unusually successful praetieionor
of the law and stands as one of
the foremost attorneys in this
part of tho country.
Enough has been sa d to con
vince the small group of strangor
of his ability; his largo circle of
friends know it already.
SHOULD BE CHANGED
Judge Jamos E. Anderson,
editor of tho Ttilarosa Valley
Tribune says that tho democra
tic state lickot "is unavailable,
not n man on the ticket thnt has
an ugly record and that all havo
been tried and found "not .want
ting." Tho Outlook editor is
inclined to believe that brother
Anderson made a slight mistake
in tho spelling of that last word,
and we would suggest that ho
change it to rend as follow:
"Tho entire democratic state
ticket is now on trail before the
people and after November 7th
the people will say by their votes
"NOT WANTED."
Geo. Castle who lias been doing
tho nlcctricnl wiring on Governor
McDonald's new home at tho
Par W ranch has completed tho
work and returned to ids home

A HIGH TRIBUTE TO BURSUM
Tho Outlook editor had a con
versation this week with one of
the most prominent nnd nrosner-
ous business men in Lincoln
County in regard to the candi
dacy of Hon. H. 0. Bursum.
candidate for governor on the
republican ticket. This party
whofoughtMr. Bursum in 1911
in the clnss with n great many
others - is now one of his greatest
admirers and gives the following
reasons why ho is for Bursum:
I am for H. 0. Bursom for
governor because he is better
qualified and more competent
to fill tho office than his opponent,
Ezekol C. De Bnca.
"Because I know his nttitudo
of heart and action toward every
good muse. Hccause he is a
gentleman at home, in public nnd
m the conduct of the campaign
in which he is engaged.
"Because his neighbors in So
corro county, where lie lives,
who know him best, and in ad-
jaccnt counties, nre his enthu
siastic supporters.
"Because all kinds of defama
tory stories wore told and publish
ed on him in 1911 simnlv to no
complish his defeat, and ho took
them all good nnturcdly and did
not mnkcrenlv.
"Because he has intellectual
gifts, and the independence to
bo the governor of this great
commonwealth.
"Because he is a great man
whom I ndmirc and in whom I
believe."
-THE REVIVAL SERVICES
Rev. Jerry Jeter and wife, who
began a mpeting at the Methodist
church last Sunday, have shown
themselvo8 to bo loyal and con
scientious evangelistic workers
who are making their appeal in
a very ellective manner. All
week the audiences at tho church
Have been good, but a movo wrts
made Thursday into the new Real
garage building, after the ontiro
day had been spent converting
tho unllni'h ;d product into a reg.
uiur uiuernacie. A rostrum has
been constructed to accomodate
a large number of singers, the
iiinno is there, and Rev. Jeter
1ms a lone space in which to
operate as ho proclaims tho word
of ucd. Hiero are a s i seals for
everybody and a hearty invitation
fo fill everyone. Electric lights
have been installed, all openings
closed except over head; in fact
nothing possible has been left
undone to mnko this placo ideal
for evangelistic sorvicos. The
meetings aro non-sectnrlaii nnd
both Protestan pastors nre sup
porting the evangelist in ove y
respect. One of the attractivp
features of the Rev. Joter's worfi
is his chulk-tnlks which precede
every sermon. To say that he is
handy with the crayon would be
putting it mild. His pictures arc
real works of art, and the accomp
anying talks well-ordered and
inspiring. All this week Mrs.
Jeter has been giving a series of
Bible Readings which manifest
much careful preparation and
havo proven a source of great
uplift to those who have availed
themselves of the opnortuniny.
Carrizozo should count itself fort
unate to have the services o)
these two consecrated workers of
nntion-wide reputation nnd make
the most of its chance for spirit
ualupilft at this time.
