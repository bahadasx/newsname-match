CAPITALISM IS
BLEEDING TO DEATH
Once again attention in directed to
the financial cost of the great war by
the announcement that the expendi
ture of Great Britain now amounts to
$30,000,000 daily, which is at the rate
of $10,095,000,000 annually. | The
chancellor of the exchequer, who
makes this announcement, adds that
even this may not be the maximum,
as no one can tell what the erpendi
ture will be a month ahead.
No doubt he is right. At the begin
ning of hostilities the expenditure was
announced at about $5,000,000 daily.
This speedily ran up to $7,00*0,000,
$10,000,000, $15,000,000. $20,000,000,
and at the end of last year was given
at $25,000,000. Now, that six months
of the present year is gone, it stands
at $30,000,000. And the end is evi
dently not yet, for most undoubtedly
the greatest expenditures are yet to
come, as the big "push" is being made.
And there are most probably two
years of hostilities yet ahead; cer
tainly not less than one year.
It may be taken as an assured fact
that the war expenditures of all the
other belligerents have Increased in
about the same rate. The end of this
month finishes two years of war, and
the expenditures have already been
certainly not less than $60,000,000,000.
One year more will most assuredly
briii- the total to $100,000,000,000, and
there may be $20,000,000,000, $30,000,-

It is not surprising that the editor
of the London Economist, Mr. Hirst,
recently resigned his position, with
the remark that the great nations
were certain to go into irretrievable
bankruptcy with a month or two more
of the war. That month or two is
already past. The predicted bank
ruptcy should be here now; but, even
so, it makes no apparent difference to
the continuation of the war. Every
thing goes on as before, except that
the expenditures continually increase.
It is as if social evolution were mak
ing sure of the death of the capitalist
system. Its upholders cannot stop
the drain, and there can be no doubt
that a debt of $100,000,000,000 will
permanently paralyze the entire cap
italism of the world. The financial
critics who assure us from time to
time that this is "the suicide of cap
ital," are certainly not far wrong.—
New York Call.
MOVEMENT FOR WELFARE
Trades unions include the work of
all those who are interested and con
cerned in the cause of the uplifting
of tollers. Dealing with labor, the
movement for humane organization
accords attention to every word, deed
or condition that affects humanity, in
order that a remedy may be estab
lished, the public mind informed and
the remedy ensue.
The Labor Journal
WANT FEDERAL
CONSCRIPTION ACT
Write to Your Congressman and
Senator About the Joker in
National Defense Act
When President Wilson signed on
June 3rd the so-called "National De
fense Act," sometimes called the Hay-
Chamberlain act, he signed a law
which provides, in time of war, for
the conscription of American citizens
between the ages of 18 and 45.
He didn't realize it at the time. At
least there is every reason to think
that he didn't. Certainly very few of
the congressmen and senators who
voted for the army reorganization law
knew that there was a general con
scription clase in it, slipped into the
law by Hayden of Arizona, clinched in
conference committee by Hay and
Chamberlain and unwittingly adopted
by both houses.
The American Union Against Mili
tarism has been endeavoring for the
past six weeks to persuade the admin
istration leaders frankly to recognize
the legislative fluke which has oc
curred and to get behind an act for
the repeal of the obnoxious clause, if
not at this session, at least at the
short session which opens in Decem
ber. For this reason we have kept
silent, preferring to give the party in
power a chance to correct this ano
malds situation free from pressure.
That course has been only partly suc
cessful. At any rate the time has
come to acquaint the country with the
facts. Bills will be introduced this
week for the repeal of the objection
able clause. These bills keep their
legislative status at the next session.
Now is the time to pledge your sena
tors and your congressmen to the
prompt repeal of the clause when con
gress meets next December.
When the Hay bill was reported out
to the house by the military affairs
committee it contained no provisions
whatever for conscription, unless the
technical provision permitting the
president to "draft" the National
Guard into the federal service in
time of war be so considered. But on
Wednesday, March 22, Chairman Hay
presented a "committee amendment"
which had been drafted, he said, by
Hayden of Arizona. This amendment
provided for the establishment of
"reserve battalions" in time of war.
The "reserve battalion" is an Eng
lish idea. When a regiment is sent
to the front, to be cut to pieces under
fire, a "reserve battalion" is estab
lished at the home depot to secure
recruits, train them and feed them to
that particular regiment at the front
as rapidly as they are needed. A sen
sible scheme and in marked contrast
with the American plan which has
been to form all the new recruits into
new regiments, regardless of how
badly cut to pieces the older regiment
on the firing line may be. When the
veteran regiments in the civil war
were reduced to three and four hun
dred men the practice was to con
solidate several regiments, producing
vast confusion in regimental records
and no end of jealousy nad friction
among the officers. aHyden's amend
ment would abolish all that.
But down in the middle of the sec
tion was the following clause:
"If for any reason there shall
not be enough volunteer enlist-
ments to keep the reserve bat-
talions at the prescribed strength,
a sufficient number of the un
organized militia shall be called
into the service of the United
States to maintain each of such
battalions at the proper strength."
The "unorganized militia" means all
male citizens, with certain specified
exemptions, between the ages of 18
and 45. The whole section was read
in the usual sing-song by the clerk.
Mr. Hay made a somewhat indefinite
explanation of the reserve battalion
idea; Minority Leader Mann quizzed
him a little; then Hayden was called
upon. He made an enthusiastic
speech on behalf of the "reserve bat
talion" idea, ignoring the conscription
feature in it. That closed the debate.
The amendment was put to vote and
carried viva vocey. WHEN THE
BILL WENT TO THE CONFERENCE
COMMITTEE, WHERE MEETINGS
ARE SECRET AND WITHOUT OF
FICIAL RECORD, THE WORD
"CALLED" WAS CHANGED TO
"DRAFTED."
But when Messrs. Hay and Cham
berlain reported to their respective
houses the full text of the compromise
bill, neither thought to mention the
existence of the draft clause. The un-

written law is that the conference
committee is bound fully to inform
both branches of congress of all sig
nificant changes made in a bill in
committee. This was not done.
ONLY BY LUCK OR THE GREAT
EST INDUSTRY ON THE PART OF
THE INDIVIDUAL SENATOR AND
CONGRESSMAN COULD THE EX
ISTENCE OF THIS "JOKER" HAVE
BEEN DISCOVERED. The thing was
buried in the middle of Section 79, the
title of which, "RESERVE BAT
TALIONS FOR RECRUIT TRAIN
ING," indicated a technical and wholly
innocent provision. There is, as we
happen to know, the greatest indigna
tion in both the house and the senate
at the lack of candor displayed by the
two men responsible for putting the
thing through. Section 79 could never
have passed either house had its real
character been understood.
IT MAY BE SUGGESTED THAT
THE HOUSE SHOULD HAVE
GRASPED THE CONSCRIPTION
CHARACTER OF THE AMEND
MENT FROM THE PRESCENCE OF
THE WORD "CALLED." But the
word "called" is associated with the
idea of volunteers. In time of war,
when enlistments fall off, the presi
dent issues a fresh "call for volun
teers." It is a stereotyped phrase.
Furthermore, on the very next day,
when the house was still discussing
the Hay bill and Representative
Miller of Minnesota was trying to see
if the language regarding the "draft
ing" of the National Guard couldn't
be softened somewhat by providing
that the National Guard should be
"ordered" or "called" to the colors in
time of war, Chairman Hay Insisted
that "called' 'didn't mean the same as
"drafted."
Mr. Miller —Could we not substitute
the words "call into the service of the
United States"
Mr. Hay—There would be the same
trouble with that language.
Mr. Cannon —Why the same trouble?
Why not amend it so that it would
read: "He shall call by proclamation
into the military service of the United
States," instead of "He shall draft
into the military service of the United
States"?
Mr. Hay—The troble about that is
that it is the nature of the troops we
are dealing with. Now. he can call
the volunteers into the service of the
United States, but this language is
necessary in order that they may
cease to be militia.

moral and financial help to the
Everett Painters' Local if troubles in
future may arise.
Monday night, September 11, the
Everett Local entertained the dele

TEXT OF ADAMSON
BILL WHICH AVERTED
A BIG STRIKE
Washington, D. C—The text of the
Adamson bill, which brotherhood
leaders said would avert the nation
wide railway strike if enacted, is as
follows:
"Section 1. That beginning Decem
ber 1, 1916, eight hours shall in con
tracts for labor and service be deemed
a day's work and the measure or
standard of a day's work of the pur
pose of reckoning the compensation
for services of all employes who now
are or may hereafter be employed on
any railroad which is subject to the
provisions of the act of February 1,
1887, 'An act to regulate commerce,'
as amended, and who are now or may
hereafter be actually engaged in any
capacity in the operation of trains
used for the transportation of persons
or property on railroads, from any
state or territory of the United States
or the District of Columbia, to any

THE REAL CAUSE OF STREET
DISTURBANCES IN OUR CITY
BUSINESS MEN WHO HAVE BLINDLY ENLISTED TO FIGHT
THE FIGHT OF THE MILL MEN BLAMED
An intolerable situation exists in
this city, for which there is no ex
cuse. The beating up of men and
boys by citizens clothed with tem
porary authority and armed with
clubs, which is almost a nightly oc
currence, reflects but little credit on
those who ostesibly stand for "law
and order." A condition of bad feel
ing and bitterness is engendered that
will hurt the city for many months to
come. Scenes such as have been
enacted on our streets are a disgrace
to a civilized community.
The Labor Journal holds no brief
for the I. W. W. The organized labor
movement of Everett had no part in
bringing them here, nor is it aiding
and abetting them, despite the in
sinuation of a local paper. I. W, W.
tactics and philosophies have never
appealed very strongly to the trade
union movement. But if ever there
was an asinine policy pursued in the
world, it is the policy of going over
the heads of the city authorities and
policing the city with a mob —mob is
the correct word —of highly respect
able citizens.
The real disturbers of the peace are
not the I. W. W.s who, foolishly or
otherwise, persist in speaking on Wet
more avenue, but the business and
professional men of this city who
have allowed themselves to be
buncoed into a private standing army
by manufacturing interests of this
city.
The immediate beginning of the
present trouble may be laid at the
door of mill owners, who turned their
motley crews of imported strike
breakers and professional thugs upon
the picket line maintained by the
striking shingle weavers. When uni
formed police stood by and idly wit
nessed that outbreak, it was the nat
ural thing that reprisals would occur.
When, a few nights later, Mr. Jami
son led his army of strike-breakers in
column formation through the streets
of the city, he was provoking trouble
and if justice had been meted out
would have himself been placed under
arrest for inciting to riot
Matters were bad enough when the
I. W. W.s appeared on the scene.
Their coming did not help matters
any, but it need not have made them
any worse had common sense pre
vailed. Whatever may be said of the
I. W. W.s, they at least are true to
their beliefs and their convictions,
and are willing to undergo physical
the pro rata rate for such standard
eight-hour workday.
"Sec. 4. That any person violating
any profision of this act shall be
guilty of a misdemeanor and upon con
viction shall be fined not less than
$100 and not more than $1000, or im
prisoned not to exceed one year, or
both."
REGISTRATION LAW
PROVING UNPOPULAR
A law requiring registration and
providing no convenient place and,
no office hours when people could
register after having traveled miles
to do it, was a very thoughtful piece
of work on the part of the last legis
lature to keep the farmers from in
itiating measures. It succeeded. And
the legislators say you are incompe
tent to make laws for yourselves
Have the people ever proposed any
thing so ridiculous, burdensome and
impossible as this Whitney registra
tion law, which received the almost
unanimous approval of the legislature
and was signed by the governor'
I.aws are supposed to benefit the
people. Has this one helped you?
Has it given you a square deal?
Note carefully the report for 1916,

suffering for them. They look upon
themselves as men called to martyr
dom in the interest of the working
class and they act accordingly. If the
authorities imagine they can club the
spirit of resistance out of those men,
they have another think coming.
The only sane method to have ap
plied would have been to ignore them
as long as they were not abusive in
their language and offered no violence
to life or property. People didn't
have to listen to thun if they didn't
want to- the city is wide. But when
the authorities began jailing them,
ordering them out of town, beating
them up, for no other reason than
they persisted in talking, they started
something. There are probably more
people in Everett in sympathy with
the 1. W. W. today than ever were be
fore—people who hitherto paid no at
tention to them or their preaching.
Not necessarily becase they have been
won over to the industrial theories of
this nomadic class of men, but be
cause the sympathy of the average
man is with the "under dog," the fel
low who is getting the worst if it in
an unequal fight.
The Journal has heard it stated that
the whole thing had a political sig
nificance. It has been rumored that
there are certain interests hitherto
powerful in the city who hope to
"show up" the city authorities as in
capable of handling the police prob
lems of the city for reasons which
will appear later, but which have to
do with municipal projects. It has
been whispered even that certain can
didates for high office hoped to profit
by the disorder. The Journal chooses
to ignore these rumors as without
foundation in fact and to accredit the
whole disgraceful affair to stupid
blundering on the part of those who
should know better.
The Journal wants to see industrial
peace re-established in this city. We
realize that the city cannot be pros
perous unless we have payrolls. We
want to see the strikes in this city
settled on a basis fair to both sides.
We are no more anxious to see the
city given a black eye than are the
business and professional element.
But we are convinced that a terribly
wrong method was employed in the
name of "law and order" and that
permanent peace cannot come until
that policy is changed.
Call off your private army and turn
I the policing of the city back to the
city authorities.

IDLE SHINGLE
WEAVERS SCARCE
Many shingle mills in Michigan,
Wisconsin and Minnesota are still
closed because of a shortage of shingle
weavers. This not withstandnlg the
fact the owners are offering consider
able more than the union scale of
wages.
The scarcity of operatives there is
due to the fact that during the past
two years many shingle weavers have
entered other lines of employment and
do not care to return to work in the
mills, where hard labor, loss of limbs,
occupational diseases and low com
pensation are their only reward. That
I this state of affairs —a scarcity of
| shingle weavers—will soon prevail in
| the Pacific Northwest, also, is certain
I unless it is forestalled by a general
improvement of working conditions.
