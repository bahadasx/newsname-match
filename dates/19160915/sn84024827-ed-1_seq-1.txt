MARSH FIELD. Ore., Sept. 14.
With her hold a mat of flames
the Pacific Coast Steamship com
pany's liner Congress raced
against death for the entrance of
Coos Bay late today and safely
landed her passengers and crew
to the dredge Col. P. H. Michie.
Shortly after the last soul on
board had been disembarked, the
Congress flared up like a torch
from stem to stern and was com
pletely destroyed. All the passen
gers and members of the crew
were landed from the Michie at
North Bend near here shortly
after 10 p. m. tonight. None of
them suffered from any Injury.
MARSH FIELD. Sept. 14. Fire
tjnight completely destroyed the
Pacific Coast Steamship Compa
ny's liner Congress two miles off
Coos Bay. Several vessels which
rushed to her aid in response to
distress calls,, helped remove her
passengers and crew. It is be-. .
lieved that no lives were lost, al
though this will not be learned
until all boats which went to the
Congress' rescue have repeated.
Passengers Crazed.
' When the dredge Michie and
the schooner Tillamook reached
the Congress, they found the liner
almost completely shrouded In
Smoke and the passengers fight
ing frantically to enter the life
boats. Despite the strife, how
ever. Captain N. E. Cousins and
his crew managed to maintain
control and the work of transfer
ring the people aboard to the res
cue vessels was carried out in an
orderly manner.
Heat Intense.
Before the last boat load, in which
was Captain Cousins, left the Con
gress the smoke and heat were al
most unbearable. Flames were shoot
ing out of the ventilators and up the
passage ways.
Enveloped in Flames.
Shortly after the last boat got
away half the vessel was on fire.
Soon afterward the flames enveloped
her from stem to stern, lighting the
sky to a crimson hue. With the wind
the steamer began drifting into the
shoals on Coos Bay.
The crew of the life saving sta
tion in a power boat reached the
Congress shortly after the Michie and
the Tillamook arrived, and helped re
move the passengers and crew to the
two latter vessels.
According to word reaching here,
the fire was discovered at about 3
p. m. in the second hold in steer
age cabin. No word was received
from the Congress, however, regard
ing the fire until nearly 5 p. m.
Wireless Disabled.
The main wireless set of the liner
became disabled at about 4 p. m. and
the operator flashed calls for aid by
means of an emergency set. getting
the Coos Bay station by the latter.
At that time the steamer was run
ning for Coos Bay. She was compell
ed to come to a Btop two miles off the
entrance.
The Great Northern was the only
steamer on the outside to respond to
the call for aid. As she was some
distance south and could not reach
the scene before 10 p. m. word was
later sent by the Michie that she
need not come.
Flames Drive Passengers.
The Congress came to a stop off
the Coos Bay about 6:40 p. m. and
was anchored between two buoys
with her stern pointed toward the
beach. The Michie was soon at the
scene. Boats were lowered at once
and the passengers went on with
great precision and those with glasses
saw the forward deck was covered
with many persons getting away from
the fiercest of the flames.
The scene as night closed in was

NEW LONDON, Conn., Sept. 14.
Major General Taster H. Bliss is to
appear before the American-Mexican
commission tomorrow when discus
sion of border problems is renewed.
He will be the first and possibly
the only witness to be interrogated by
the commission in a joint session as
it is said to be the desire of the
Americans to facilitate proceedings
by keeping out endless discussions of
persons who wish to be heard. It was
thought advisable that General Bliss
should explain to the Mexican com
missioners the military aspects of
border plans as seen by United States
army officers.
No definite plan for border patrols
has taken shape in the minds of the
commissioners. The Americans con
ferred with General Bliss again to-,
day. It was indicated that the pro
posal which appealed most strongly
to them was that a border constabu
lary be created to operate as a police
force along the border of the two
countries. It was. suggested that the
force be composed of the soldiers of
both countries under joint command.
It was argued that the Mexican people
would not feel toward the constabu
lary the same hospitality that they
displayed toward the American troops.
It also was suggested that the police
force would be far more effective In
ridding the mountains of northern
Mexico of bandits.
The session was devoted to an in
formal interchange of views on the
enforcement of law in Mexico and on
the guarantees to personal property
rights. The Mexican commissioners
presented a clear picture of the pur
poses of the Carranza government
with reference to the reform of the
codes of procedure. They explain
ed the fact that under the Diaz regime
the judicial procedure was so cum
bersome and expensive and the judi
ciary so corrupt that it was impossi
ble for a poor man to obtain justice.
"The purpose of the Carranza gov
ernment is to so simplify procedure
that the courts of justice will be open
to all and that the personnel of the
Judiciary will be so carefully selected
that corruption and bribery will be
completely eliminated. As soon as the.
plan of the revision of the constitu
tion has been carried through the
judiciary will be in a position to en
force the law Impartially. In short,
the purpose which the Carranza gov

NEW YORK, Sept 14. Theodore

night through his secretary, John W.
McGrath, announcing that he will not
support Samuel Seabury, candidate for
governor of New York on the Pro

"Mr. Roosevelt has stated explicitly
to the Progressives who have asked
him to support Mr.. Seabury that he
would not do so," the statement said,
"because Mr. Seabury is supporting
Mr. WikVm and is running on the
same ticket with Mr. Wilson and

bring about the re-election of Mr. Wil
