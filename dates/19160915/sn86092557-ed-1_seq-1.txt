PITTSBURGH, Sept. 16. ? H. C. 1
Frlck, who was In Pittsburgh yesterday
on one of bis hasty visits, expressed
so much confidence In the continuance
of prosperity in America that he
declared United States Steel, at the
war price of 107, its record high mark,
is "cheap" and a very good Investment.
The present excessive prosperity in
this country Is dependent upon the
wax, he admitted but he added that,
even so, there is no immediate danger
of a cessation of the good times.
"The hostilities are certain to drag
on and on?at least, for a year and a
half more," he predicted.
The only danger he descries in the
near future is the possibility of more
labor trouble. "Conditions will continue
good, I am sure?unless we have
too much labor agitation," he said.
Charles H. Schwab, of the Bethlehem
Steel company, said yesterday
that he bad never known the demand
for steel to be so great. He would not

Finest Kind of Reports Being"
Received >At State
Headquarters
(Special Dispatch to West Virginian)
CLARKSBURG. W. Va., Sept. 15.?
Campaign managers at Republican
Btate headquarters are cheered over
reports coming In from all parts of
the state as to constantly Improving
party conditions. Many of these reports
are made in person. Among the
callers was Judge Reece Blizzard, of
Parkersburg.
"Wood county is in fine shape." declared
Judge Blizzard, "and will give
her UBual majority for the entire ticket.
The news from Maine was an Inspiration
to our voters, and Its effect
was instantaneous and noticeable. It
was a concrete and forceful demonstration
to the rank and file that the
country Is headed Btrong in the direction
of a return to government undor
the direction of the Republican party."
Col. Thomas W. Fleming, Republican
candidate for Congress in the
First district, was another visitor at
headquarters. Col. Fleming had Just
come in from several counties in his
Ustrlct and reported party conditions
highly satisfactory. He expressed himself
confident of the First district returning
to the Republican column next
November by an unmistakably large
majority. He brought news of the formation
of a Republican club in Fairmont
which had already enrolled 750
ind would reach a total membership,
he said, of 1,600 within the next few
uajo. nuuuior large ciuo IS m pro:ess
of organization at Mannlngton.
"A great meeting was held for Judge
Robinson at Beckley," said Houston Q.
Young, candidate for secretary of
itate, who came direct to Clarksburg
!rom the Raleigh county capital. "Raleigh
county has rapidly Bhaped up
satisfactorily," he told the campaign
nanagers here. "It Is the home of Attorney
General Lilly, but his friends
there have followed General Lilly
vholeheartedly Into the ranks of Robinson
supporters. They are sincere
ind they are active. Leading party
nen there told me that there Is no
teed to fear for the Republican ticket
n that county and confidently predtctsd
that It would give a majority of 1,100
for the ticket."
George E. White, Dr. Larrabee and
3. S. Stathers came In from Lewis
sounty. "Lewis county conditions arn
ill right," said Mr. White. "The Maine
results nave surrea up our voters,
troused their enthusiasm and (Hied
hem with an assurance of victory."
Randolph reported today In the perion
of genial Mike King, of Elklns,
vho, though he was not a winner In
he primary for the secretary of state
lomtnatlon, says he hasn't a sore spot
in him nor anything in his heart except
the kindliest feelings for his felowmen.
Mr. King la enthusiastically
or the entire ticket and Is bubllng
>ver with optimism for Republican
luccess. "We will have to hand It to
he old Pine Tree state," said Mr.
ting. "It made the biggest contrlbuion
to the Republican campaign In
