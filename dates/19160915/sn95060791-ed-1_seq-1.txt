HUNT WAS RENOMINATED
The Governor's Political Machine
Was Working Fine Last Tues
day and His Nomination Was
Accomplished bu a Large Ma
jority.
Less than 75 per cent of the
registered voters in the state
voted in the primaries last Tues
day. The percentage of demo
cratic voters who went to the
doIIs was much larger than that
of the other parties. The con
test between Hunt and Olney for
the nomination for governor
furnished the incentive for the
democrats to attend the pri
maries, and probably more than
75 per cent of the registered
democrats voted. There being
no close contests in the republi
can party, fewer voters in that
party went to the primaries.
The returns from the election
have been very slow in coming
in especially in this county.
Nearly one-half of the precincts
had made no report up to the
time the News went to press,
and there is but little prospect
of getting accurate figures until
the official count is made by the
board of supervisors next week
Outside of Navajo county a suf
ficient number of precincts
throughout the state have report
ed to give the general result, al
though majorities cannot be
figured accurately.
Governor Hunt was renomi
nated by a majority of approxi
mately 5000 votes. Senator
Ashurst was renominated as was
Representative Carl Hayden.
Henry D. Ross was nominated
for the supreme court justiceship
and Sidney P. Osborn for secre
tary of state. Jesse L. Boyce for
state auditor and D. F. Jonnson
for state treasurer had no oppo
sition. Wiley E. Jones was nom
inated for attorney general and
C. O. Case for superintendent of
schools. Amos Betts, for corpo
ration commissioner, G. H. Bolin,
for mine inspector and Chas. R.
Howe, for tax commissioner,
were all nominated. The repub
licans nomination Judge Joseph
H. Kibbey for the United States
senate and H. L. Eads for repre
sentative in the lower house of
congress.
In Navajo county there were
only a few contests in the two
leading parties. A. B. Randall
was nominated by the republi
cans for assessor over Z. N.
Decker. In Winslow W. F.
Brewer defeated A. H. Hensen
for justice of the peace by a
small majority. In Holbrook
precinct no candidate for justice
of the peace had been placed on
the republican ballot but the
name of W. B. Woods was writ
fen on the ballot by five voters
and he was thereby nominated.
Whether or not he will accept
and make the race he has not
yet decided. W. H. Clark and
Jj. D. DJvelbess were elected
precinct committeemen.
In the democratic party for
county officers there was a spirit
ed jcontest for the office of county
attorney between Attorneys
Thorwald Larson and G. C. Ba
zell. The former was nominated
by a safe majority, the exact
figures of which can not be given
at this time. Mr. Larson claims
that his majority will be between
100 and 150. A. M. Boyer was
nominated over A. D. Lathrop
for justice of the peace for Hol
brook precinct. R. S. Teeple
and C. H. Jordan were elected
precinct committeemen in Hol
brook precinct.
The republicans of Navajo
county did not nominate a candi
date for county superintendent
of schools, and the present in
cumbent, Prof. Joseph Peterson,
will have no opposition in the
general election. Miss Dee M.
Moss, county recorder, will like
wise be reelected without oppo
sition, her republican opponent,
Miss Eleanor Henderson, having
filed her withdrawal yesterday.

Charles Moore Reappears
Last Friday evening Harvey
Moore, of the local Postal Tele
graph office, received a message
from his sister in Amarillo, Tex
as, stating that their brother
Charles, who had been missing
since July 5 when he disappeared
from a United States engineer
ing corps near Frazer, Colo., was
in Amarillo. Later advices from
Amarillo state that the young
man had been working for
several weeks in that city, that
he had forgotten his own name
and his previous places of resi
dence, not remembering that he
had formerly resided in Amarilio
Young Moore was but 20 years
old and at the time of his dis
appearance was employed in áh
engineering corps oi ine u. o.
forest service near Frazer. On
the morning of July 5 he left his
camp for the purpose of check
ing up some work done on the
previous day, stating to his com
panions that he would return by
noon. From that time until last
Friday all trace of him was lost
despite the fact that his family
and his friends, and the state
authorities of Colorado, had done
everything possible to find him.
His mother in Holbrook had
never abandoned the belief that
her son would be found and his
father was in Colorado pursuing
the search when the news of his
son's re-appearance reached him.
Beyond a doubt the young
man's disappearance was caused
by a sudden attack of aphasia.
or loss of memory, brought on
by oyer mental work and the
additional nervous strain of liv-
ng in the high altitude of the
Rocky mountains. How he
traveled from Frazer, Colo., to
Amarillo, Texas, will probably
remain a mystery. That he has
come again into possession of his
mental faculties, and is regain
ing physical health is cause for
rejoicing in his family, and
among his many friends in. Hol
brook.
Mr. Donohoe Weds Miss Saunders
Last Wednesday evening Mr.
James Donohoe and Miss Maud
Saunders were united in marriage
by Judge A. M. Boyer. The
ceremony was performed in the
private office of Dr. J. W.
Bazell, Dr. Bazell and Miss
Catherine Lassiter, acting as
witnesses.
The news of this wedding came
as a surprise to the friends of
the contracting parties. Miss
Saunders, who has been tele
phone operator at the local ex
change for nearly a year, had
asked Manager Woods to be re-
íeved, ostensibly for the purpose
f visiting relatives in Kansas.
Mr. Donohoe had disclosed his
ntentions to only a few of his
most intimate friends and these
friends had kept the secret.
Mr. and Mrs. Donohoe left
Holbrook at 11 o'clock Wednes
day night for Adamana, where
they will make their home. The
News joins their hosts of friends
in this vicinity in wishing for
them a long and happy wedded
ife.
Mrs. Raunolds Entertains

M. Raynolds entertained a num
ber of friends delightfully at a
card party. Progressive whist
was played, after which dainty
refreshments were served.

L. D. Divelbess, the consolation
falling to Mrs. C. E, Perkins.
Others present were Mrs. P. T.

Alleged Murderers Caught
Wednesday morning of last
week Undersheriff W. G. Clemons
arrested in Holbrook two men
wanted in Joolin. Mo., for mur
der. The names of the men are
Bob Adams and F. O. Brown,
and their arrest was made upon
telegraphic advices received by
the sheriff's office from the au
thorities at Joplin.
Adams. Brown and a third
man named Gene Jarrett are
charged with the murder of a
saloonkeeper named Mike Dona
hue, whom they held up and at
tempted to rob about midnight
August 12 in Joplin. Donahue
resisted the robbers and was
shot and killed by them. Jarrett
was arrested shortly after the
crime was committed and made
a confession implicating Adams
and Brown. The two latter had
left Joplin the night of the mur
der, and had been located here
by a telegram Adams sent to a
pal in Coffey ville, Kans., asking
for money.
Monday morning Harry J
Mead. C. E. Slevin and W.
Bridges, deputy sheriffs in Jop
lin, arrived in Holbrook with re
quisition papers and at 11 o'clock
that night left for Joplin with
the prisoners, Adams and Brown,
To the editor of The News Mr
Mead stated that Brown ang;
Adams are notorious gamblers
and that their companion in
crime, Jarrett, is a saloonkeeper.
All three men have evil reputa
tions and their conviction of the
attempted robbery and murder
is almost sure.
A reward aggregating $800
had been offered for the arrest
and conviction of Adams and
Brown, and Undersheriff Cle
mons, wno ettectea cneir capture,
expects to get the money.
Cronemeyer Blankets Being Sold
While litigation over the estate
of Curt Cronemeyer ha3 not yet
come to an end, the court has
decided to convert all holdings
of the estate into cash, and has
ordered the sale of some thou
sands of fine Navajo blankets.
These blankets have been
brought to Albuquerque and
have been put on sale in the old
Dunbar office, southeast corner
of Gold avenue and Third street.
Prices will necessarily be low so
as to close the stock out quickly.
There are all sizes, shapes and
qualities in the lot, and no finer
display was ever seen in town.
Curt Cronemeyer was an In
dian trader at Allentown on the
New Mexico-Arizona line. Some
thing over a year ago he was
murdered, and since then the
estate has been in litigation be
tween relatives of Cronemeyer
in Germany on the one side and
an alleged Navajo wife and chil
dren on the other side. -Albuquerque

L. H. Mickey Stops Runavmy Team
Last Saturday evening L. H.
Mickey, local livestock inspector,
gave a splendid exhibition of ex
pert horsemanship in stopping a
runaway team belonging to H.
P. Bushman, of St. Joseph. Mr.
Mickey was sitting on his saddle
horse near the Santa Fe station
when he saw the Bushman team,
which had been left by the driver
in front of the Old Trails hotel,
start down the road towards St.
Joe. He at once started in pur
suit, overtaking the runaway
team before it had reached the
town limits and turning it north
in the street running to the new
school house. When the team
had reached the Wetzler addi
tion Mr. Mickey rode to the side
of one of the horses, caught the
bridle rein and succeeded in
bringing both horses to a stop.
Those who saw Mr. Mickey's
fine exhibition were enthusiastic
in praise of his action.
Harness Races at State Fair
If early indications are a crite
rion, the harness races at the
State Fair this fall will be by
far the largest ever held in the
Southwest.
Friday. September first, was
the closing day for entries in
colt races, and from the enthu
siasm shown by local horsemen
this year, these races will prove
to be one of the big drawing
cards of the Fair.
With the closing date for en
tries in the aged horse events
still fcur weeks away, Secretary
Shaughnessy reports that he al
ready has more entries for these
events than were received al
together last ear. The fact
that the Arizona State Fair is
held late in November after all
the other race meets are over
tends to draw the horsemen
irorn ai sections ot the country.
The horses on the grand circuit
and the great western circuit
will work south and wind up in
Phoenix. The same can be said
of those racing on the Rocky
Mountain and Pacific Coasts cir
cuits. Efforts are being made to in
duce horsemen from all parts of
the country to winter in Arizona,
as the climate of this section
affords ideal training quarters
for horses the year around, and
it is believed that several of the
big eastern horsemen will winter
their stables on the state fair
grounds this winter.
