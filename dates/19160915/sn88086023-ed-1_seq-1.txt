MAR811FITLD, Ore, 8pt. 15. -With
her hold a mass of flames the
Pacific Coast Steam.-dilp company's
liner Congress raced against death
for the entrance of coos Bay late yes
terday and safely transferred her pas
sengers and crew to the dredge Col
onel I. H. Machle, 30 mllea off shore.
Shortly after the lost soul on board
hud been disembarked, the Congress
flared up like a torch from stem to
stern and was completely destroyed.
All the passengers and most of the
crew were landed from the Michle at
North Bend, near here, shortly be
fore 10 P. m. tonight,
Two members of the crew were
overcome by the smoke. They are
Chief Engineer B. ilartlaml and F.
Tyson, an assistant In the steward's
department. The former's condition
Is not serious hut the latter was tak
en to a hospital at North Bend in an
unconscious condition.
En route from San Francisco fot
Seattle with 1(1 passengers and a
crew of 176, the Congress was dis
covered to lie on lire eight miles oft
this port at about 3 p. m. yesterday.
When attempts were made to send
out calls for assistance, the vessol's
main wireless set (ailed to work.
Meanwhile the liner had begun the
heroic race for i-hore. Shortly before
p m. the wireless operator managed
to send an S. U. 8. call on an auxil
iary set, but by that time the smoke
was pouring from the ventilators and
mange ways on the steamer.
Two miles off Coos Bay bar the
Congress was forced to stop and cast
anchor. Had the dredge Michle not
been working on the bar when the
Congress approaches Coos bay, a tra
gic disaster probably would have re
sulted. The Michle ratio- close ulong
