NUMBER 13
BIS FIRE DESTROYS TWO
ADALiS WHEAT WAREHOUSES
Warehouses in wbkh were stored
between 125,000 and 130,000 bushel
of wheat burned to th ground Satur
day evening at Adams and the damage
will amount to maoy thousands of
dollars. Th origin of th fir ia un
certain. Two warehouse burned, one being
th big warehouse, 300 by 60, belong
ing to H. W. Collins of Pendleton, and
the other th private warehouse of
Caspsr Woodward. They were ad
Joining each other. Three boxcar al
so were burned and the poles carrying
the power line of the V. V, A L. Co.
across the road burned, breaking the
line and putting Pendleton in dark
ness for several hours;
More than 100,000 bushels of wheat
were stored in the Collins warehouse
but much of it was not damaged. The
wooden framework ef the warehouse
burned so rapidly that only the wheat
on top and side of the immense pile'
waa burned. That down in the pile 1
believed to be totally unhurt while
there will be aome salvage from tb
scorched wheat It probably will be
used as hog and chicken feed.
There are different theories as to
the cause of the fire. It was dis
covered between 4:30 and 5 o'clock
in the afternoon, shortly after th
passing of a westbound freight on th
O-W tracks. Thi lead aome to be
liev that a spark from the engine
caused the fire. Some think a bolt of
lightning struck one of the warehous
es. A number are of the opinion that
someone in the warehouse had been
smoking and had dropped a match or
cigarette. '
Most of the loss is covered by in
surance though number of farmer
having grain in the house were not
insured up to the market price. Some
of the wheat wai already sold and
the grain companies were protected
..... . v w n:
by blanket insurance, sir. voums
states that his loss waa fully covered.

; Two acres of lawn have been put in

provement is a triangular piece of
ground between the O.-W. railroad
tracks and the main highway and
when this is covered with greensward
it will present a very pretty sight
to all who pass either by way of the
railroad or the highway. There are
several other improvements under
way, one including tbe planting or
trees alonir both sides of the ' road
leading into th Hospitals -Tribune.
