QUEBEC BRIDGE COLLAPSED.
Ninety Went Down with Arch,
Nine Reported Dead, Most of
Survivors Seriously Injured.
The great central span of the
Quebec bridge over the St. Lawr
ence, the largest structure of its
kind in the world, collapsed Monday
and sank 180 feet ! into': the river.
Ninety men were carried down with
5000 ton arch. The number of dead
was placed at nine. Most of the
survivors rescued by small vessels
that glutted the river at the time of
the disaster were seriously hurt.
Thousands witnessed the catastro
phe, including members of the
Canadian and Australian Parlia
ments. Second Similar Accident.
The hoisting of the central arch
into place was the last big task in the
gigantic engineering project that
will represent an investment of $17,
OCO.000, and a vast throng had gath
ered from far and near to see the
enormous span put into plaee.
The collapse is the second accident
of its kind to the bridge. Nine years
ago a span fell into the river, ex
acting a toll of 70 lives.
Stories as to the actual collapse
differ. The immense steel arch had
scarcely been raised 15 feet from the
pontoons when it plunged to the sur
face of the river and sank 180 feet.
