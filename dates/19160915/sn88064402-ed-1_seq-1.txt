HUDSON MAXIM APPEARS
IN GREAT PICTURE PLAY
Famous Inventor Will Be Seen In
"Battle Cry of Peace" at Welsh
Auditorium Monday Night
One of the most interesting charac
ters in "The Battle Cry of Peace,"
which is to be shown at the Welsh
Auditorium Monday September 18th
is that of Hludson Maxim, the famous
inventor, who appesrs in the early
part of-the picture, and by means of
small models, illustrates on the screen
the crying need of preparedness.
He shows in a sort of prologue how
the United States is fatally inferior to
all other flrst-class powers in naval
equipment, in army forces, in coast de
fense, and in possibilities for meeting a
sudden conflict.
He shows how in his opinion the city
of New York and its environs fall an
inevitable victim to the bombardment
of the ene.my's ships and makes the
point that all the ammunition manu
facturing plants of the United States
are within a two hundred mile radius
of New York City.
The dramatic portion of "The Battle
Cry of Peace" is enacted by such dis
tinguished stars as Charles Richman,
Norma Talmage, Louise Beaudet, Belle
Bruce, Mary Maurice, L. Rogers Litton
James Morrison, Joseph Kilgour and
Evart Overton.
Not one of these renowned motion
picture stars is more impressive than
the aged, kindly-faced inventor whose
brain gave the world the most de
structive death implement ever known
--the michine gun.
$900,000 ROAD BONDS VOTED
IN CALCASIEU PARISH
Lake Charles, Sept. 13.-By an
overwhelming vote the taxpayers of
Calcasieu parish yesterday voted
$900,000 for the further extension of
the present highway system. Three
years ago a bond issue of $900,000 was
voted which was later supplemented
by $300,000 in certificates of indebt
edness. This makes a total spent and
authorized for good roads of $2,000,
000 in Calcasieu parish.
In Lake Charles the property vote
for the road bond issue was close to
$1,000,000, while the vote against it
was not one-fifth that amount. The
thirJ city ward cast a property vote of
approximately $700,000 for the bonds
and $21,000 against, being the banner
precinct in the parish.

DEMONSTRATION AGENT
TELLS OF NORTHERN TRIP
Editor Times-Record: Being one
of the fortunate fifty-four on the re
cent "Farmers' Observation Tour" of
the north, I deem it of interest to
your readers to write something about
some of our observations. The tour
proper covered only ten days, but as a
full chapter could well be devoted to
each (lay, this article will necessarily
have to deal only with the most salient
features of the trip.
The first stop was made at Cham
paign-Urbana, Illli.i-s, the seat of the
state agricultural college. This is one
of the largest agricultural colleges
in the country, the campus covering
210 acres with its 43 buildings and a
student enrollment of 5,200, last of
which 1,265 were students of agricul
ture. The college farm comprises
800 acres on which are being given
practical demonstrations in all phases
of work in farm products and live
stock. Two interesting tests here
are (1) A pen of cows which have
been fed for the past four years on
corn silage and cottonseed meal alone
and showing splendid condition; (2) A
plat of land planted continuously to
corn for the past 37 years and with
an average yield yet of 22 bushels.
S.nother experiment besides this is
thl ee plats, No. 1 of which has had
only corn and a yield this, the 10th
year of 26 bushels; 2nd, plat has had
soiling crops with corn and turned
under and made this year 60 bushels;
the third plat had both soiling crops
and fertilizers (barnyard) and made
90 bushels. This shows plainly the
effect of humus additions to soil, a
fact which no farmer, north or south,
can afford to overlook. It is safe to
say that not an acre of this Illinois
prairie would have produced from vir.
gin soil over 40 bushels of corn, but
through drainage, good seed and good
tillage, soil conservation and building,
t'here are now thousands of acres pro
ducing double this yield. What has
been done in Illinois can be done in
ILouisiana.
The Funk Brothers, seed corn spe
cialists, at Bloomington, showed us
some very interesting and instructive
results in corn breeding. These men
have taught the people of Illinois a
'esson in seed corn values that has
idded millions of dollars to the wealth
Df that state. Pedigreed corn is now
the slogan there and a farmer would
no more expect a good crop of corn
from a planting of scrub seed than he
would expect a scrub cow to become
a profitable producer in his dairy.
The Louisiana Corn Breeders associa
tion is trying to do for this state
what the agricultural college and
Funk Bros. have done in Illinois.
At Chicago we visited South Water
street and with its enormous volume
of produce arriving daily, we were im.
pressed with that great truth that uni
formity of produce and pack count
tremendously. At the Union Stock
Yards where we were guests of the
Armour and Swift companies, unifor
mity of shipments was shown to ad
vantage; a car of solid black, red or
whatever, colpr of stock finding a
much more ready buyer than a motley
car of stuff that may otherwise be
just as good. The one other great les
son here was efficiency and economy.
Not a scrap of products nor a minute
of time is lost, everything bieng done
with clock-like precision.
Our route next led to Milwaukee
where we spent only a few hours;
just long enough to find out what
made the town famous. Our next
stop of interest was at Waukesha,
Wisconsin, which is in the dairy cen
iter of the .northwest.° That state
leads all others in amount of dairy
products,and has within its borders
some of the finest strains of dairy cat
tle in the world. We spent part of
two days driving through the country,
visiting dairymen and getting infor
mation at first hand. A ride through
that part of the state is like a drive
through miles of parks, every farm
house and barn and every acre of
land almost as well cared for as if it
were a park. Milk sells at the farm
house door at 12 to 15 Cents a gollon;
butter fat at 32c a pound. They feed
all the year round, few of the cattle
ever stepping inside a pasture. We
feed less than four months, get 50
cents for butter fat; 30 to 40 cents for
milk and complain of the little profit
in the business. We found the reason:
They have the best cows money can
buy; they treat a cow as a machine
and feed the machine to its capacity.
They feed the cow just the ration that
will give the greatest flow of milk
and the work is done by efficient labor
that does things intelligently, no
guessing. Manure is as scrupulously
cared for as if it were the precious
commercial stuff we buy in tons and
pay good money for. They milk
cows that give 4 to 8 gallons a day
and 1 1-2 to 2 1-2 pounds butter fat
and make a profit. We milk scrub
cows with inefficient-1ibor and get 2
gallons of milk a day and 1-2 pound
butter fat. The southern cow browses
most of her feed from a pasture of un
cultivated grasses, the quality and
food value of which we know nothing,
the little feed she gets being given
more to get her to "stand" while being
milked than for its milk producing
qualities. This is not intended as a
knock but merely a gentle reminder
that our methods are in many in
stances crude and inefficient. We
have an advantage in climate and
long growing season ana a splendid
soil for building up a great agricul
ture and when we have spent as many
years of good, hard, well-directed ef
fort in soil betterment and up-breed
ing of live stock ,we wil Ihave a coun.
try second to none. Louisiana as a
whole is yet in the pioneer state in
both farm produce and live stock, but
the work of development has already
started in earnest and the next ten
years will find us as well developed
as many of our good neighbors to the
north.
A tour such as we have just had is
invaluable in bringing about this
development, the chief value lying
in the fact that it will enable our
southern farmers to make compari
sons, take the short cuts to success by
avoiding the mistakes that naturally
attend theexperimental stages of de
velopment. These .tours should be
conducted every year and every farm
er who can possibly avail himself of
the opportunity should take the trip.

SIXTH CONGRESSIONAL SEAT
IS WARMLY CONTESTED
New Orleans, Sept. 14.-After a
day of uncertainties, in which both
Iex-Governor Jared Y. Sanders and
Amos L. Ponder claimed the demo
cratic nomination for congress in the
sixth district, the semi-official figures
tonight still give Sanders a lead of
around 300 majority, it may be a lit
tle less or a little more. Both Sanders
and Ponder are in Baton Rouge watch
ing the official returns from the
twelve parishes as they are compiled
by the secretary of state.
Sanders telegraphed from the cap
ital last night that his majority
would finally show over 300 majority.
Ponder wired that he felt, certain of
nomination by at least 200 majority.
Ponder charges irregularities and
alleged frauds in the election, declar
ing that three boxes in St. Tammany
were irregular and one box in Boga
lusa, the home town of Sanders,
where Ponder charges irregularities
of over 200 votes.
"I am going to insist on the throw
ing out of these boxes," announced
Mr. Ponder last night. "They can't
put any crooked work over on me."
Livingston parish, which was in
doubt, has given Ponder a majority
of 210, during the day he claimed it
i by 350. St. Helena, which was cred
ited to Ponder by 176, now appears
to have given him about 105 majority.
Sanders' early reported majority
of 500 to 800 was whittled down by
Ascension going against him by 117
majority, by Washington, his home,
swinging Ponder for over 100 ma
jority and by a shrinkage of his
vote in Pointe Coupee and other par
ishes.
As it stands Sanders has carried
West Baton Rouge by 105 majority,
St. Tammany 293. East Feliciana 85,
West Feliciana about 100, East Baton
Rouge 816, Pointe Coupee 126.
Ponder has carried Ascension by 117
majority, Iberville 51, St. Helena 105,
Tangipahoa 550, Washington slightly
over 100 and Livingston 210.
