Fred Goro, a young man about 35
years of age, was struck by a falling
'log at the A. L. & T. logging camp
Friday at about noon, and instantly
killed.
Ho was hooking logs for the steam
loader when the hook slipped oil the
log as it was swung in the air. Gore
was underneath it and was unable to
get out of tho way when he saw it
slip. Tho log struck him across the
back, crushing his chest, causing
death instantly.
He was a married man with three
small children. They were visiting at
a ranch on Anderson Mesa when the
accident happened, but have a home
in Flagstaff.
Goro was highly thought of by all
the men and his sudden death cast a
gloom over the entire camp.
In the absence of Judge Harring
ton, Judge F. 0. Twitty, of Williams,
was called in to hold an inquest Fri
day afternoon. The verdict of the
jury was accidental death.
Gore has a mother living in Tu
cumcari, N. M., and has made his
home in Flagstaff for about two
years. Mrs. Gore and children were
visiting an uncle, Mr. Wccms, at the
time of the accident.
The funeral services were held on
Sunday afternoon and were attended
by the greater part of the employes of
the camp, which was shut down Saturday.
FLAGSTAFF HOTEL CO.
CAN NOW SELL STOCK
The Flagstaff Hotel Company re
ceived word yesterday that they had
been granted the privilege of selling
stock by the state corporation com
mission, and A. W, Bikker, the au
thorized fiscal agent, will commence
tho work of getting funds together to
day, for the big enterprise.
He has a good sized list who have
already agreed to take stock among
the business men locally, and after
closing up the business here will go
"cast among larger investors.
Bikker Acquires More Property.
A. W. Bikker, the insurance man,
is acquiring a reputation as the rapid-
.fire buyer and seller of Flagstaff real
estate. Since disposing of a portion
of his half block to Mrs. W. H. Power,
he has purchased the south half of
the block from Frank Payne. Ho pro
poses to clear it of all small buildings
fand improve it by putting down ce
ment walks connecting up with the
rest of his property on the Agassiz
street side.
He figures that with the new hotel
going up across the street and the
paving being done, that this section
of the town -will eventually be one of
the most important business centers.
When the property owners take an
interest, as they seem to be doing
now, thousands of dollars in value
(can be added to the value of property,
once known as the bug hole center,
built up of shacks, barns and corrals.
Watch it grow.

Greatly Enjoy Weeks Spent Here.
John L. Munds, Mrs. Senator Munds
and family, who have been camping
at Lake Mary since returning from
the Moqui snake dance, came in from
the lake Friday. Mrs. Munds left for
Seligman by train" with the children
and Mr. Munds left Saturday in his
car.
Mr. Munds is an ex-sheriff of Yava
pai county and well known all over
Arizona, especially in the northern
part, where he has been in the cattle
and sheep business, and now has
turned to mining in the Oatman dis
trict. In speaking of the month
spent here camping, he says: "We
had the most enjoyable time of our
lives and know of no better place to
spend a summer."
Con Fredericks Breaks an Arm.
Con Fredericks had his shoulder
dislocated and his arm broken just
below the elbow last Friday.- He was
helping the cow punchers on tho rocky
mesa near Lake Mary and took tho
rope after an animal had been roped.
Ho took a snub around his saddle horn
and the critter was strong enough to
pull the saddle off his horse, throw
ing him among the rocks. The shoul
der dislocation is the most severe of
his injuries and his arm is badly
swollen. The broken arm will heal
up nicely without much trouble.
Miss Miriam R. Lightburne, having
graduated from the Toronto Conser
vatory of Music on the violin and
piano, has returned to Flagstaff to
resume her classes in music. She
also hopes to start her orchestra
again. '.Phone 46. ' 3wks

l
It
Latest reports from Coconino coun
ty give it to Hunt without question.
The majority has not as yet been
figured out, and some precincts had
not come in late yesterday.
L Local Contests Among the Democrats.
Harry Embach won the contest
handily over Mercer Hemperly for
representative!
For supervisors, it seems certain
that the two democratic candidates
will be Fred Holden of Williams and
Chas. Woolfolk of Flagstaff.
For justice of the peace, with four
candidates in the field, M. A. Murphy
won by a good plurality.
Chas. A. Jones, democratic candi
date for county attorney, won easily
over F. M. Gold, of Williams.
Republican Contests.
C. B. Wilson won the nomination
over Crable by a good majority, for
county attorney.
Mrs. Bozena Allen will be the re
publican candidate for county school
superintendent, having defeated Mrs.
Eva Marshall.
The supervisor fight is a close one
and while it is conceded that Bert
Cameron will be the west end candi
date, the vote is close' between Fred
Garing and George Herrington, with
Garing a shade the best of it from
returns received, but it will probably
take the official returns before the
winner is named.
TJie fight for justice of the peace
in this precinct is close, and it looks
at" the present writing as though
Judge Layton had won.
Wm. Grant cleaned the field for
constable as against his competitors.
There was a record vote cast in the
four Flagstaff precincts Tuesday. The
vote was; Precinct No. 1 (court
house) 187; No. 2 (old Catholic
church) 192; No. 3 (McMillan hall)'
331; No. 4 (Doyle's) 317; total, 937
votes.
There is but little doubt of the nom
ination of Governor Hunt, though he
lost in Maricopa county.
The "outs" in the democratic party
who attempted to get in were kept
out by the former office holders, cither
appointive or elective, and the demo
cratic tirket will show few new faces
this year. It looks as though the
Hunt machine had firmly established
itself in the saddle, and there is lit
tle hope of the other faction of the
democracy ousting it.
On the republican state ticket there
were but two contests. One between
Kibbey and Stillwell for the U. S.
senate, in which Kibbey won by a big
majority; the other between Eads and
Nelson for congress. Eads seems to
have won the fight from all first re
ports. Hunt has carried Coconino county
by a good majority, larger than was
at first expected, though the county
had been conceded to him from the
first.
The republicans are taking a great
deal of comfort from the big repub
lican victory in the state, of Maine,
where; they regained two United
States senators and swept the plate
clean of democratic congressmen, also
electing a republican governor by
some 15,000 majority.
"1 S i-
(Special to Coconino Sun.)
Phoenix, Ariz., Sept. 13, '16.
Impossible to even give approxi
mately total figures of primary, but
it is certain that Governor Hunt was
renominated by no tles3 than 5,000.
Other successful democrats were
Jons for attorney .general, Ross for
the supreme court, Osborn for secre
tary of state, Case for state super
intendent of schools, Betts for corpor
ation commission, Bolin for mine-inspector,
and Howe for the tax com
mission. Kibbey was nominated by the re
publicans for the senate and probably
Eads for representative. The so
called court house ring in this county
was almost wiped out All against
whom fights have been directed are
defeated except Lyman for superior
judge, who has a small and uncertain
lead.
El Morto Escota was assessed a
$200 fine or 200 days in jail for peg
ging away with his six-shooter within
the city limits last Sunday night and
disturbing the neighborhood.
Much promiscuous shooting of the
kind has been going on in the neigh
borhood of the Mexican dance hall
during the night, and a watch had
been set to discover the individual
doing it. Deputy Sheriff Tom Phelan,
who is special game warden for that
vicinity on dance nights, captured Es
cota with the goods on him, including
the shells.
Judge Layton figured that it was
high time that such a dangerous pas
time should be permanently inter
rupted, and handed out the maximum
dose for the offense. Escota had more
time than money and took the time.
Valley Rancher Would Have
Preferred Flood More Scattered
Captain George Alkire came up
from his ranch at Glendale yesterday
morning to spend a few days with his
family. Capt Alkire says the recent
floods in the valley did considerable
damage, but not as much as was re
ported. The downpour was beneficial
in a great many ways to the valley
ranchers, regardless of the damage to
ditches, for there had beenv little or
no rain all summer to freshen up
things generally. While the lack of
the usual summer rains will reduce
the general output of the ranches
some 25 per cent, prices are excep
tionally good and he looks for more
prosperity down there the coming
year. He will return tomorrow in or
der to be there in time to vote this
fall. '
Will Organize a New Orchestra.
Miss Miriam Lightburne returned
to Flagstaff this week from Phoenix
and will organize a violin and piano
class. She recently returned from
Toronto, Canada, where she has been
the past year studying music, and af
ter a short visit to her home in Phoe
nix, decided to again return to Flag
staff and again take up the work she
left some time ago, and will also or
ganize an orchestra. She made a
splendid success of the former mixed
orchestra of young people, and will
undoubtedly do so again.
Child Injured by Motor Truck.
The little five-year-old son of Chas".
Gyber was painfully injured last Fri
day, when he was accidentally
jounced out of a small motor truck
ia which a delivery friend was giving
him a ride. The machine struck a
rough piece of road and the little fel
low was bounced off the scat. 'The
rear wheel of the machine struck his
foot, cutting an ugly wound and badly
straining the ligaments. No bones
were broken, nor is it thought that
any permanent injury will be done the
little fellow.
Miss Pearl Newman Gives
Concert at Williams
Miss Pearl Newman, the silver
throated daughter of J. D. Newman,
who has attained more than a local
reputation as a vocalist, went to Wil
liams yesterday to give a concert.
She was accompanied by Miss Flora
Jensen, another Flagstaff musician
with a most enviable reputation as an
instrumental performer. It is under
stood that Miss Newman will favor
Flagstaff with a concert within a
short time.
Ankle Broken by Bad Fall. .
W. D. Molloy, the painter, fell from
a scaffolding while painting the Geo.
Black house yesterday, and sustained
a bad fracture of the ankle. Just
how the Occident happened we were
unable to learn, but Mr. Molloyis
pretty well along in years and a frac
ture of the ankle is one of the bad
breaks to recover from with any de
gree of rapidity.
Clean Clip of Finger Tip.
Street Supervisor Fred Russell met
with 'an accident Monday in which he
clipped the first joint of the index
finger off his left hand. He was
hitching up his team and attempting
to fix something about the whiffle
trees, when the team stepped ahead,
catching the tip of the finger in'ihe
chain. He had it attended to immedi
ately, and believes he may yet be able
to save the tip.
Chris Kurchard Dead.
Chris Kurchard, a well known lum
berjack, died last Friday at the county
hospital, after a few weeks' illness5
with an nbscess on the brain.
He was of German origin and a
man about 45 years of age, with many,
friends among those who knew him
here.
