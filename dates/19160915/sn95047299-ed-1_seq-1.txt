Reapectfully,
NE PUTHflU NATIONAL BANK OF PALATKA
N. E. Shonts, state organizer of the
Farmers Kducational and 'Coooo.V:ve
Union of America, has received a let
ter from the state secretary advising
him that the National President, C. S.
Barrett, and the State President, J.
L. Shephard, will be in Palatka on
Saturday, September 30. The pur
pose of their visit is to officially pass
on the program of the national con
vention in conjunction with the board
of trade. The convention will be held
the third week in November, begin
ning Tuesday the 21st.
This is an event of the greatest im
portance to Palatka as this city has
not only to uphold her own reputation
for hospitality, but that of the state of
Florida as well. There will be about
400 delegates in attendance upon the
convention, but the national conven
tion of the Farmers Union are of so
much importance and their delibera
tions are of such moment to the farm
ing interests of the entire country
that the attendance of outside visitors
will greatly exceed the number of del
egates. The people of Palatka and
Putnam county may as well realize
right now that they will have to open
their homes to the visitors in order to
see that none are turned away for
lack ot accommodations. . There are
hotel accommodations for about COO
visitors, and every other available
room in Palatka will be needed, this
is certain and the facts may as well
be met today. There is no further
time to be lost in making prepara
tions for our guests.
The importance of this convention
on the future of Palatka and the state
of Florida is too far reaching for us
to leave anything undone that will
make a favorable impression upon our
visitors.
It is also Mr. Barrett's desire that
a mass meeting of the members of
the farmers union from all this sec
tion of Florida be held while he is
here, and President Tenney of the
Putnam county local has called a
meeting for Saturday, September 30,
at 2 p. m. at the county court house in
Palatka.
Arrangements have also been made
for a public reception to Mr. Barrett
and Mr. Shepard at 4:30 in the after
noon at the Putnam House. In the
evening at 7:30 at the Court House,
Messrs. Barrett and Shepard will ad
dress an open mass meeting, and it is
hoped that United States Senator
Duncan U. Fletcher can also be in
duced to accept an invitation to speak
at that time.
A general invitation is given for all
who desire to hear one of the most
prominent and influential men in the
affairs of the nation discuss the co
operative and educational movement
among the farmers of America. Mr.
Barrett is the leader of more than
two million farmers in all parts of
the United States and his words car
ry weight in every state in the Union.
Under his leadership the Farmers
Union has become an important fac
tor in bettering agricultural condi
tions throughout the country.
After the meeting at the court
house grounds Messrs. Barrett and
Shepard will be the guests of honor at
a public banquet at the Putnam
House under the auspices of the
board of trade and the Farmers Union
of Putnam County. It is proposed to
make the banquet thoroughly repre
sentative of the county and the city
and in this way bring about that spirit
of cooperation between city and coun
trv for which the union stands.
Tickets to the banquet will be $1
They can be secured through secreta
ries of the different local unions and
the Board of Trade.

Dr. Johnson Takes Vacation.
Dr. H. E. Johnson leaves Palatka
today for a vacation of some five or
ix weeks in New York, and it is be
iieved that he will stop over for a day
or two en route at his old Georgia
hDr." Johnson is one of Palatka's bu
siest physicians, for some years hav
ing been associated with Dr. Geo. t.
Welch, who will do double duty dur
ing his partner's absence. Dr. John
son is entitled to his vacation, and his
hosts of Palatka and Putnam county
friends will hope that he will enjoy

CMS' TALES WILL
IT BEARJHE LIGHT
One of Catts' Palatka Sto
ries Shown to be a Base
falsehood.
At his meeting in this city early in
the present month, Rev. Sidney J.
Catts, in his efforts to arouse preju
dices of a religious nature and in
open defiance of democratic principles
and the democratic platform, intimat
ed that the election of Mr. Knott
meant "Catholic rule in Florida." Mr.
Catts, in order to illustrate his point,
then drew the following word picture
of conditions in Pensacola, where he
alleged, "Catholics run things:"
"Pensacola,' said Mr. Catts, "is run
by the Catholics, who have caused the
passage of ordinances forbidding
prayer or any sacred music in the
public schools." He said that "if
a young lady teacher should open
school by singing such old favorite
and standard hymns as 'Nearer My
God, To Thee,' 'Rock of Ages,' etc.,
she would be promtply arrested and
find $25 and costs." Mr. Catts
dwelt at some length on this sub
ject, quoting a number of religious
liynins that were familiar, and which,
shquld an attempt be made in the Pen
sacola schools to sing them, would be
met with an instant fine of $25 and
costs.
The story was of course preposter
ous, and yet there are many people
here in this city who heard Mr. Catts
make the statement that night who
implicitly believe it.
But it didn't strike all in that way,
not by a long shot. One gentleman
who was present and heard it, and
who by the way is a prominent protes
tant church worker in Palatka, has
taken trouble to find out the TRUTH
He wrote to Hon. John B. Jones, City
Attorney of Pensacola, concerning the
reply:
(COPY)
CITY OF PENSACOLA
Commission Government
John B. Jones
City Att'y
Pensacola, Fla., Sept. 12th, 1916.
Mr...
Palatka, Fla.
Dear Sir:
I duly received your letter of the
6th inst., stating that "the Honorable
Sidney J. Catts, candidate for Gover
nor, in a speech here some few nights
since, told his auditors that the of
fering of a prayer or the singing of
a hymn or any devotional exercises
at all in the public schools of Pen
sacola was punishable with a fine of
$25.00," and requesting me to advise
you "whether or not Mr. Catts is right
in his statement, or slightly misin
formed." The City of Pensacola has no sucn
ordinance, and has never attempted
to impose any such penalty, or to in
terfere with the affairs of the public
schools in such manner as Mr. Catts
is alleged to have stated.
Yours very truly,
JOHN B. JONES,
City Attorney.
Manager Brown to Marry.
The State, published at Statesville,
N. C, gives an account of a recent
that citv at which
announcement was made of the ap
proaching marriage ot Miss tL. ueona
Love, a popular and charming young
lady of that city to Mr. I. E. Brown
of Palatka, Fla. Mr. Brown is the
genial and popular manager of the
Southern Bell Telephone & Telegraph
Co. in this city, where he came last
spring as successor of Mr. F. L.
Thorp. He is to leave here Oct. btn
for Atlanta, and his marriage is to
take place on the 11th. The follow
ing is the announcement as made at
the Statesville function:
Mrs. L. C. Caldwell and Miss Lois
Love at the home of the former, en
tertained yesterday morning at a par
ty, the conclusion of which revealed
tl'.o enirgcment of the hastcsses'
pister, Miss Leona Love, to Mr. I. E.
Brown of Palatka, Florida, the wed
ding to take place October 11th.
First Rnnk was rjlaved on the porch
which was attractive with sunflowers
r.nd nasturtiums in abundance. Miss
I.ee pf Raleigh won the high score
prize, a bottle of toilet water. Miss
Catherine Johnston of New Mexico,
house guest of Miss Louis Love, and
honoree was presented with a prize al
so. Miss Love, the bride-to-be, receiv
ed a piece of lingerie. Miss Gene
vieve Myers served punch from a
pretty alcove; the punch bowl was
banked with clematis. The guests
were then showed into the dining
room where a salad course with tea
and sandwiches was served by Misses
Helen Cooper, Margaret Flanigan, ;
Mabel Pressly, and Sarah Sharpe. '

DORSEY IS JW EASY
And Gov. Manning Vins in
South Carolina Over fc'x
Gov. Cole Blease.
Atlanta, Ga., Sept. 14. Hugh M.
Dorsey will go into the Georgia dem
ocratic convention at Macon Septem
ber 26 with a big majority of votes
pledged to him for governor as a re
sult of the state primary on Tuesday.
While returns today still are incom
plete, figures at hand give Dorsey 107
counties with a convention vote of
260, Gov. Nat E. Harris 37 counties
with a convention vote of 98, Dr. L.
G. Hardman, four counties with ten
delegates and Joseph E. Pottle three
counties with a half dozen delegates
also. A majority in the convention
will be 192 votes.
The difference in the popular vote
for Dorsey and Harris was not as
great in proportion as the delegates
gained, that being due to Harris run
ning a close second in some of the
counties to which the greater number
of delegates are allotted.
Apparently all state house officers
with the exception of Governor Har
ris are confident they will be return
ed, although the race between W. J.
Speer, treasurer and his opponent W.
J. Eakes is close and later returns
could put Eakes in the lead.
M. L. Brittain, state school super
intendent, has a safe lead over Alex
ander E. Keese.
In the first congressional district
whejje Charles Edwards declined to
offer for renomination J. W. Over
street evidently has defeated Peter W.
Meldrim, former president of the Am
erican Bar association. The count in
the Twelfth district is in favor of
Judge W. E. Larsen, in his race
against Congressman D. M. Hughes
and it will take more complete re
turns to determine the winner. Other
congressmen who had opposition ap
parently have been successful.
R. E. Davidson, incumbent, has a
wide popular and convention vote
lead over his . three opponents for
prison commissioner but returns do
not indicate he will have a majority
in the convention.
C. M. Candler and Guyton McLen
don, incumbents, have safe leads over
James H. Peeples and J. A. Perry, re
spectively, for places on the railroad
commission.
W. W. Larsens maintained his lead
over Congressman D. M. Hughes, in
the Fifth district and apparently is
nominated while the race for commis
sioner of agriculture between the in
cumbent, J. D. Price, and J. J. Brown,
still needs the official count to decide
the winner. Price had a sligh lead
in convention votes at last reports.
Places of other state house officers
were not threatened.
It will take the official count to de
cide which of the fourteen aspirants
for the three places on the court of
aDneals bench will nave the largest
number of convention votes and it ap
peared likely today the real battle
would be fought in the convention.
The three highest on the face of re
turns available today are W. Frank
Jenkins, O. H. B. Bloodworth and
Walter F. George.
J. W. Overstreet has defeated Peter
W. Meldrim, former president of the
American Bar association for congress
from the First district where Con
gressman C. D. Edwards retired.
In the Eleventh district Congress
man J. Randall Walker is being close
ly pressed by J. E. T. Bowden.
Comolete returns from the sixteen
counties in the Eleventh congression
al district give Congressman J. Ran
dall Walker a nlurality of 300 over
his opponents, W. S. Thomas and J. E.
T. Bnwden.
Other congressmen who offered for
renomination were successful.

Mr. Hodge Elected Governor.
At the meeting of the Palatka
board of trade on Monday night, the
alter. dance was not laree. not over a
dozen membeis being present. Most
ci ine time was taken up over a die-cus.-ion
of ways and means of enter
taining the big Farmer's Union i on
vention which is to meet in Palatka
next November, and when delegates
from every state in the union will be
present to the number of anywhere
from 500 to 700.
L. A. Smith who is Just now wal
lowing in the delights of a much
needed vacation along with Gus Will
ard up at Tate Springs, Tenn., and
whose waters are used in an internal
cleasing process and taste more like
mortified vegetable matter than any
thing short of a basket of over-ripe
guavr.s, tendered his resignation ss a
member of the board of governors to
which he was elected without consul
tation a couple weeks ago, giving as
his reason a press of business. H. C.
Hodge was elected to the Smith va
cancy. Mr. Hodge is an excellent man for
the place young and active and zeal
ous for Palatka. He is a member
of the Mann-Hodge Seed Co. in this
city, a company that is building up a
splendid business in all parts of the
State.
and "I. E. B." with the date "Oct. 11,
1916." The company then snowerea
the bride-to-be with rice. Miss Love
is popular with a host of friends here.
Mr. Brown is congratulated upon win
ning this attractive young lady.
The decorations throughout the
house were pretty. The dining room
was an especially attractive room with
a color scheme of yellow. The din
ing table bore a luncheon cloth with
a centerpiece of a big basket of yel
low dahlias and cannas, the handle of
the basket being topped with a bow
of yellow maline twined with clema
tis. The candelabra was twined
with yellow tulle and clematis. Yel
low dahlias and cannas decorated the
sideboard and tables.
Gov. Manning Wins Over Blease.
Columbia, S. C, Sept. 14. Gover
nor Mannintr was renominated for
governor in South Carolina in Tues
day's primary over former Governor
Cole L. Blease, according to nearly
complete unofficial returns. Manning
has more than four thousand lead.
Representative Wyatt Aiken in the
third district has apparently defeated
F. S. Dominick.
James Causler had twenty thousand
majority over Albert S. Fant for rail
road commissioner.
Thomas P. Storey has defeated
Francis M. Bryan by a majority of
1,200 for solicitor (State's attorney),
of the Charleston judicial district.
The primary on Tuesday came as
the climax to a campaign which, by
reason of the long lead of Blease in
the first primary, two weeks ago, and
the apparent upset in the predictions
of many of the political observers,
takes rank as one of the most excit
ing in the history of tin ctate. In the
first primary Robert A. Cooper, of
Laurens; John T. Duncan and J. M.
Deschamps, of Columbia, were candi
dates with the two who ran it off.
Blease ran some 24,000 votes ahead
of Governor Mannning, but lacked
more than 8,000 of the majority re
quired for nomination. Under the
rules of the Democratic primary,
where no candidate receives a majori
ty, all but the two highest are elimi
nated and a second race is held.

"Won't Print Both Sides."
A wi'.ter in one of our local papers
makes complaint "that The Palatka
News will not publish the good things
s:iid about Mr. Ci'.tts, but that it pub
linhes a!I t' r.t it can find against him."
That is not true. Tho News pub
lishes but a small fraction of the
charges which have been proven
Y.'inat Mr. Catts. If it printed all
there vcuk1. be room for noiing else,
uni! t vculd hr.vo to publish a paper
doub'..'! its present size eacii week.
The News pleads guilty to not pub
lishing any good things concerning
Mr. Catls. But there is reason for
this. Up to the present time its edi
tor has seen nothing good concerning
him eminating from a democratic pa
per. The Jacksonville Free Press is
full of him (Catts) and it lauds him
to the skies. But the paper is abso
lutely unreliable and is not a demo
cratic paper. Mr. Mathews of the
Fort Lauderdale Sentinel has also said
some thing3 about Mr. Catts com
pared him to Jesus ChrisWbut The
News considers such utterances as
blasphemous. There are several dem
ocratic papers in the State that are re
garding Mr. Catts as the democratic
nominee; hey started in immediately
touowing the meeting of the State
canvassing board, and are still so re
garding him. They were hasty and
evidently regret their haste anyway
tney are saying nothing good concern
ing the man; rather they are tolerat
ing him, which is more than The
News can do now. It may have it to
do later. But The News never pad
dles in a dirty stream when there Is
clear water in sight.
His Last "Stag" Supper (?)
Thirty-five sorrowing, woe-inspired
members of the Palatka B. P. O. E.
(bestpeopleonearth) gathered at Bob
James' cafe last night for a farewell
supper to Arthur A. Corcoran, for
several years a confirmed bachelor,
but who has been converted and on
the 19th inst. will join the innumera
ble company of benedicts who have re
nounced the world, the flesh and the
''evil and tied themselves to a skirt
forever and a day.
Like other men who have gone the
road in advance of him, Mr. Corcoran,
while somewhat nervous, is spending
his last days in joyous anticipation
and wears a smile that appears to be
fast color and will never come off. He
carried this smile to the banquet last
night and wore it throughout all the
"joshing" that was handed him by the
speakers of the evening.
Some of the speakers were married
men themse'ves and of course were
scmewhat guzrded in their utterances,
lut in the main the cxpress'ms were
t.) the effect that Mr. Corcoran was
nr.t taking any serious risks.
It was a banquet style supper got
ten up in Bob James' best m-inner,
seven course including a large, cold,
clammy bottle and a small, hot bird
of the duckling pattern. Dave Ben
bow, who in married and tho fatlier of
a family was present as toast
master and to chaperone some of the
more giddy. After the supper all ad
journed to the Elks' Club, where there
was more nice talk and where bene
dictions were pronounced. When Mr.
Corcoran left to go to his quarters
he found his old room mate, Dr. John
son, had entered in advance and was
prepared to comfort him. 'Tis said
that the doctor held his hand and
cautioned him not to worry, but to
taper off gradually from all his Elk
dom foolishness, keep a brave heart,
face the future -with gladsomness and
bye and bye he would find the home
life so much more preferable that he ,
wouldn't miss the things that he now
enjoyed. The doctor said he knew,
for in the practice of his profession
he was frequently called upon to enter
homes to lug out a man who was
wanted down town, and it was hard
work.
