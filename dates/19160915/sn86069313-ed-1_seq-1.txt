REACHES END OF TRIP
l'lutt!iurK Speech Marks Closing f
First Trip of Presidential
CiinipulKii.
Plattsburg. N. Y., Sept. 12.
Charles E. Hughes In the last speech
of his llrst presidential campaign
trip, asserted hero tonight before ft
crowd that Mled tho opera houso
that the result In Maine hnil proved
the Republican party was reunited.
Jle declared the party would not
"change Its plans or alms." Persons
,1n the uudlcnco took the reference to
npply to criticisms of the methods
pursued In conducting the present
campaign and applauded the nominee
vigorously.
'I como to you," Mr. Hughes said,
'as the spokesman of a reunited Re
publican party. Wo havo said It was
reunited, we have devoutly hoped It
was reunited. Now Maine proves
that It Is reunited. Whoever was
skeptical about that before, must
hide his cynicism now. Wo shall
abandon no efforts. We shall not
change our plans or alms, but we
shnllVj forward with renewed confi
dence becauBo tuo old State In the
northeast corner has ap'oken In 'no
uncertain voice."
Mr. Hughes assailed tho Wilson
Administration for failure to reduco
the cost of living, for extravagance
for falluro to protect American lives
arid rights abroad and for falluro to
"live up to Its promise to observo
the merit system." Tho nominee em
phasized " the prevf6us declarations
that tho campaign was a "good-natured"
ono. He delighted, ho said,
to call his political opponents his
'friends on the other side."
"It Is a tlmo for assessment, for
appraisal and for candid statement,"
he said. "No ono In this country
can object to full and fair discus
sion That Ib tho very spirit of our
Institutions. Hut wo aro all friends,
however divided politically.
"I do not desire, in speaking of
those who do not agree with mo, to
manifest tho slightest disrespect. If
tho argument Is sound it will carry
without any -suggestion of personal
enmity. Wo do not need that In
Hour campaigns. What wo need Is
fairness and truth, and then lot tho
electorate decide.
"Our friends on tho other aldo
tickled tho ear with many promises
.which they havo not fulfilled. They
'said that tho Republican party was
responsible for tho high cost of liv
ing. They havo been In power for
some time and I do not see that tha
high cost of living has been reduced.
It seems to be beyond Democratic
control.
"It. was said they would dispose
of many useless offices. Tho aboli
tion of useless ofllces has not been
quite so apparent ns tho appolut
mont of useless officers. It was said
that they would got rid of extrava
Kance. Tho Hepubllcan party was
arraigned for extravagance. Now It
becomes our painful duty to nrratgn
tho Democratic Administration for
extravagance.
"Our friends on tho other side
told us four years ago that they woro
going to be true to tho principle of
tho civil sorvlco. Tho princlpio of
tho civil service has boon fcetrayed.
They told us that tho lives and prop
erty of American citizens 'abroad
would bo protected. That was ono of
their most explicit promises. That
was sound doctrlno. Tho only trou
ble was that It was not porformed."
Earlier in tho day tho nominee vis
aed the military training camp hero,
remaining for dinner with MaJ. den.
Leonard Wood. Tonight Mr. Hughes
praised tho camp In his speech.
"It is a training school In democ
racy, ho said. "It is a dlsclDtlno that
knits men together In wholesomo
comradeship. It Is preparedness, not
only military, but civil and moral.
It is a great means of drawing men
of all sorts together In recognition
Jot a common fellowship and In tho
delight of wholesome co-operation.
'That Is the spirit we must have
In this country If -America 1b to go
U
forward, If America Indeed Is to
hold her" place among the nations in
tho troublous days of tho Twentieth
Century.
"I dcslro to bco those camps main
tained In various parts of our land
and men In constantly Increasing
numbers seeking the benefit of the
training and discipline. I believe
that our citizen reserve should be
trained under Federal authority. I
think It was a great mlBtako to aban
don tho plan that was llrst formulat
ed with that end In vlow.
"This Is tho land of the frco and
tho homo of tho brave. If it ceases
to bo tho heme of tho bravo, it will
soon cease to be tho land of tho
free."
A delegation of former Progres
sives, headed by William E. Howell,
chairman of tho Progressive County
Committee, and a number of suf
fragists, occupied scats on the plat
form. Mr. Hughes left Plattsburg at
10:50 o'clock tonight for New York.
Ho will remain there until tomorrow
afternoon when ho will go to his
siimmor home at Drldgehampton,
Long Islnnd, there to remain until
September 1 7 or 18, when he starts
on his second campaign trip.
