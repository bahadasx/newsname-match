L... Our New Preacher.
Rev. W, Jf. Fogleaong,- the new pas
tor at Louisa,1' bears the' reputation of
being one of the best preachers In the
conference. He Is 86 years bid and has
a wife and little son, age about ten
years. He transferred from the Hol-
ston conference six years ago, and has
served only two congregations since
that time. He comes hero from Clarks
burg, after three years there. His wife
Is an active ond efficient church work
er. He will not be able to reach Louisa
in time for next Sunday, as Clarksburg
Is a long distance from Louisa ond he
Is parking and shipping his household
goods before coming here. He will ar
rive In the early part of next week.
Rev. McEldowney.
There is general' regret In Louisa
that Rev. McEldowney was not return
ed here. But It has been realized for
some time that Charleston's efforts
might succeed In getting him bock.
The clrcumatonces under which he was
changed from there lost year were such
that his congregation hod never ceas
ed In their efforts to secure his return,
and they evidently convinced the Blhh
op that the move was absolutely neces
sary. Next Year's Conference.
The question of where the confer
ence shall be held next year was settled
In favor of Louisa, after on invitation
was extended. The new church
will be completed long before
that time, ond we will therefore be In
position to accommodate the body. The
conference pays obout $600 to the local
church that entertains it Louisa was
host to this conference in 1895 ond
took care of It nicely. It will not be
difficult to do so oguln.

JUDGE CISCO DENIES
SAMPSON AFFIDAVIT
JURIST GIVES 8TANLEY REA
SONS FOR DECLINING TO
TRY CONTEST CASE.
Frankfort Ky., Sept. S. Branding as
untrue the statement that he election
eered, canvassed ond supported Judge
A. J. Kirk for Appellate Judge of the
Seventh District, Judge Allan N. Cisco,
of the Thirty-second Judicial District
today filed with Governor Stanley his
reason for declining to try the contest
case of Kirk against Flem D. Samp
son. .
On the doy designated for the trial
of the cose Judge CIbco sold he ap
peared In the Knox Circuit Court and
took the oath of office as special Judge.
Immediately following this Sampson
filed an affidavit objecting to Judge
Cisco trying the case on the grounds
that he supported Judge Kirk In his
race fur Appellate Judge. Judge Cisco
says:
I decline to try sold cane, not be
cause I regard the grounds as tech
nically sufficient but I do not care to
try o case where a litigant questions
my Integrity."
Continuing he says: ,
"I was not a citizen of the district
in which the election was held for the
nomination for this office of Appellate
Judge. While I was In the district on
the day of the election, I was there on
behalf of a personal friend, who was
In no. way connected with the Appel
late Judgeship race. I am not a law
partner of Mr. Monroe Nlckell, named
In the affidavit, and hove not been
since the first of the year. He and I ore
distantly related. While I know that he
was a supporter of Judge Kirk, I never
heard him express himself about this
case one way or the other. I do not
know whot port if ony, he took in the
campaign for Judge Kirk,
"My only purpose wf-8 to discharge
my official duties to the best of my
ability." .

AUCUSI WAS HOST ACTIVE
MONTH IN OIL FIELDS
KENTUCKY NOW 18 LEADING IN
AMOUNT OF NEWLY DEVEL
OPED PRODUCTION.
Barbourvllle, Ky., Sept 10. Kentucky
is now leading oil the high-grade pe
troleum fields of the country In amount
of new production being developed. The
month Just closed was the most active
in the history of the field, notwlthstond
ing a declining market New produc
tion developed exceeded 3,000 barrels
dolly, an amount greater than that
shown by any of the Eastern or North
ern -fields.
Completions In the main districts
during August totaled 113, of which
twenty-seven were failures. The as
gregate doily yield amounted to 3,680
barrels.
The month's average was greatly in
creased by the drilling of on unusually
large number of wells producing 100
barrels daily or more. The Estill coun
ty field' contributed ten wells produc
ing around 100 barrels each, in oddl
"on to a large number of producers
making from fifty to seventy-five bar
rels.
The beginning of the month showed
close to 160 rigs up ond wells drilling,
the largest number ever In commission
in the Kentucky fields. In advance de
velopments little progress was noted
during August with few exceptions
new wells being drilled close to defined
lines. In the Allen county fields of low
er Kentucky two slight extensions were
indicated while Estill county showed
some widening of the productive area.
Completion of new pipe lines during
the month afforded a better outlet for
the large production of upper Kentucky
fields and greatly Increased the State's
showing In output The average daily
yield Is now around 6,000 barrels and
increasing.
In late, reshlts the possible opening
of a deeper sand In Estill county Is im
portant A well drilled Into the Clinton
sand shows a small production. This
Is the first well drilled In the county
to show o yield In a deeper formation,
ond other tests will be made.
Twenty-three new wells are credited
to Estill county with an aggregate yield
of 800 barrels. In lower Kentucky , the
Allen county fields are reviving and
hove shown o number of good produc
era during the post few days. Six new
strikes make nearly 100 barrels In the
aggregate. '
Eastern Kentucky counties continue
to show little In the way of new pro
ductlon. Four new wells are reported
from Wayne county, two being fail
ures and two producers of fire barrels'
capacity each.
In Morgan, Wolfe and Lawrence
counties, where the heavy cost of drill
ing makes a high price necessary.light-
er results have been apparent since
the decline in price. No new wells are
reported from these districts.
All over the State lease taking con
tinues with unabated vigor. The five
fold Increase In Kentucky's petroleum
production this summer has brought In
operators from oil sections of the coun
try, ond the search for new production
is being carried Into every county that
shows the . least indications of petro
leum.

WRS. JOHN GILLUM DEAD.
Mrs. Gillum. wife of Mr. John Oil-
lum, died Thursday at the home of her
son, Mr. Tom Gillum in Ashland after
an illness of eight weeks. Her death
was due to old age. The deceased waa
ninety-five years old and was born In
MagoRln-co. She was a daughter of
a late Isaac and Sarah Patrick Jack
son and In her death the link Is brok
en which Joined the present to the past
for nearly a century. She has lived all
her life In Magoffin and Elliott coun
ties until only tha past few weeks which
she has spent with her son. She was a
woman of unusual traits of character
and had her own opinions about things
which she not only expressed but were
carried out even after her passing. She
belonged to what is known as the foot
washing Baptists. And during her life
and Illness was strong in her religious
beliefs and reared her family by the
same faith. She always requested that
when death came, her daughters should
dress her and .prepare her for burial .
and that her aon, Isaac should make
her coffin as she wanted no undertaker
about She also requested that there
should be no foolish expense and that
things should be Just as plain as they'
possibly could be made, and that It
was foolish to put Into the ground
something that would do no one any
good either In this life or after death.
She said she was going on a pleasant
Journey and that Jesus was with her
and would walk with her and she want
ed no tears shed, and that she wanted
