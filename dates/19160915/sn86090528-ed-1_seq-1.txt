MLS THE TALE OF
BIG ACHIEVEMENT
Never Has Showing at Free Fair Been
Excelled by Educational Display
ol Former Years
All Exhibits in Place and Those Who At
tend Tonight and Tomorrow Will
Be Well Repaid
Ono of the most meritorious efforts
which have been directed toward mak
ing the 1916 fair a success is that
which resulted in an educational dis
play far superior to that of last year
and equal to any that has ever beon
assembled in -the county. Under the
immediate direction of Miss Zinn, as
sistant county superintendent, the best
of order and system was maintained
througohut the arrangement of the ex
hibits and no time was lost nor hin
drance offered to the public during the
placing of the contributions from the
various schools and districts.
Schools Come in Bodies.
s School life contributed materially
to the gaiety of the occasion today
when the scholarship of several coun-
' ty schools arrived enmasse, headed by
the teachers, to see the many curious
things which the big tents offered.
Practically all of the sixty-eight pu
pils of the Gilbert school, headed by
the teachers, Mr. and Mrs. C. H. Bun
nell, arrived about noon in a body and
made things merry in the interesting
textile tent, joining with the entire at
tendance of Union Hill in an inspec
tions of the grounds.
The Verden delegation, headed by
A. M. McCullough, arrived in full force
today, while the scholarship of Amber
and Minco will arrive tomorrow.
The village schools represented are
Amber, Minco, Verden and Tuttle.
, Two-room Schools.
The two-room schools are Union
Hill, Lucile and Gilbert. The Uuio l
Hill exhibit Is' In charge of Mr. and
Mrs. D. E. Killian, the Lucile display
in charge of Mrs. Effle Bateman and
Miss Vivian Noyes, Amber is repre
sented by A. E. Wlckizer,. Minco by
J. V. Morgan, Verden by A. M. Mc
Cullough and Tuttle by A. C. Floyd.
Of tho one-room schools represented
at the fair tho splendid work in the
Freeman school, which won the loving
cup last year, was done last year un
der the leadership of Miss Anna Mad
Dempsey last year. The Oak Grovo
school booth was in charge of Miss
Ruth Smith.
The South Ward school display from
Chickasha is in charge of John H. Dun
can and the West Ward of Mrs.
Charles Rogers. ' ' ' ; ' '
Meritorious Displays.
While the entire display reflect
credit on the school systems of Grady
county, individual contributions which
form component parts of the exhibiis
unmet attention. In the Minco booth
the yarn and paper weavings are espe
cially good as is the graphite work.
A piece of crochet work executed by
little Lucile Rucker, the five-year-old
daughter of Undersheriff Kucker, at
tracted the attention of many. The
little miss had decided, after seeing
her mother crochet, to make a piece
"for grandma.'' The present never
reached; grandma, however, for, at
ti acting the attention of the leaders
of the town fair, it was placed on ex
hibition there and was later brought
to the Minco booth here.
The drawings iu geometry in the
Amber collection are unusually gooj
while the mudhouse constructed b
the primary department of the South
Ward school and the raffia baskeU
made by the third grade are intensely
interesting.. . ,,
A pointer for economical; house
wives is furnished by the Union Hill
sihool which, at a cost of 72 cents let,
tdiows a serviceable tireless cook'-r
made of asbestos, excelsior and a
yooden bucket,
Motuers and children were espe
cially pleased with the woven hum
mock and dolls and the paper cuttings
Bt the West Ward building booth.
A cool day and many fair bttrac-
tioii8 brought a big crowd to Shanoan
Springs this morning and afternoon
in attendance at the second free coun
ty fair. General satisfaction was ex
pressed by the hundreds who throng
ed the grounds.
The entries and e'xhibits are now In
place and those who visit the grounds
this evening or tomorrow will find
much to interest them.
Free Trips to Winners.
Among the features of the prize list
at the Grady county fair this year are
the inducements which are offered for
women, boys and girls to perfect their- j
selves along tnoBe lines which con
duce to the development of agricultu
ral resources of the county and to
home economics. In the canning
club, better bread, poultry club, com
club, feterita, kafir, milo maize, cot
ton club, peanut club and pig club
sections railways expenses to and
from Oklahoma City to the state fair
school are offered as first prizes if
club members are eligible, and as a
second yrizc traveling expenses to
and from Stillwater to the farmer's
winter short course. If members are
under 14 years of age substantial
money prizes are award'd.
Ineligible Birds.
An interesting feature in connection
with the poultry exhibit is the fact
that all members of the Grady County
Poultry association are barred from
"competing for prizes but have been
earnestly requested to have birds or.
exhibition as an additional aid to the
regular mid-whiter annual show. All
such birds, however, are being prop.
erly cared for, with free exhibition
coops, feed,jparetaker and scoring.
The superintendent will undertake
the sale of birds for exhibitors not
present, charging a commission of ten
per cent on such sales. All prizes not
called for within thirty days after the
close of the show will revert to the as
sociation. Parade of Horses.
An important feature of the horse
department is the parade of the vari
ous breeds in front of the grand stand.
Notice is given of the time and place
of tunning and any exhibitor failing
to promptly comply with the call of
the superintendent is fined such part
of the premium which may fall to him
as the management may see fit to
determine. All horses computing for
premiums must be properly groomed
. ' Clean Free Shows,'
G.ie of the features of the county
fair this year is its clean free shows.!
In speaking of this today County At
torney Venable said:
' "The Grady County Free Fair asso
ciation ought to be commended for
having good, clean free entertainment.
They had a number of applications
from parties wanting to operateamh
ling devices, such as doll racks, jingle
boards and candy race tracks but
steadfastly refused concessions for tint
class of entertainment. They are de
termined to place their fair on a high
plane so far as the free shows are
concerned.
"In this respect," continued the
county official, "a number of the
townships in Grady county erred, sev
eral gambling devices having been per
mitted to operate before being stopped
i by county officials. Get a crowd !
I any cost, seemed to be their motto."
"Under the plan which they have
adopted in starting off they will have
no trouble later on. I do not see why
the county and townships cannot all
have absolutely clean entertainment
so that people leaving the show will
observe that it has been a good deal
fair."
