did he not say so before two-thirds

the House of Representatives ? Why
didn't he ask the republicans sent

so."--.

London, Sept. 15. Officials of the
treasury have been surprised by the
steady inflow of gifts from all parts

of cash towards meeting the expenses
of the war. The donors range from
men and women to small boys and
girls, the former sending sums mount
ing "up as high as a thousand pounds
and the latter remitting the contents
of their savings banks. A total of
many thousands of pounds has been
sent. Sums ranging from a shilling
to a thousand pounds are acknowledg
ed with the same promptness and
politness by the treasury.
Many gifts are accompanied with
notes explaining that they are de
signed as substitutes for personal ser
vice at the front, and one man in Can
ada explains that a sum of 200 pounds
is intended as payment for schooling
obtained in England a half century
ago.
Many of the gifts are sent in the
form of monthly donations, one man
in Asia having instructed his bankers
to remit a certain sum to the treasury
monthly until the end of the war.
Among anonymous contributions are
those of 5,000 and 4,050 pounds re
spectively, among the few mentioned.
The women are t contributing gener

INSANITY ON THE
DECREASE IN IRELAND
(Associated Press)
Dublin, Ireland, Sept. 15 Insanity
in Ireland has lately shown a decrease,
chiefly among women. This is some
thing new, as Ireland's statistics for
insanity have always been unusually
high. The superintendent of the asy
lum at Belfast declares the reason for
the decrease is due entirely to the
improved standard of living and to
the restrictions on the liquor traffic
Many people who lived in poverty, are
now in comparative luxury. - There
are, he declares, solid grounds for the
hope that, especially among women,
Ireland will witness a great diminu
tion of neurotic disorders..

SITUATION
(Associated
New London, Sept. 15. It seems
improbable that any agreement for
the pacification of the Mexican border
will be reached by the Mexicai
American joint commission, without
prolonged discussion. Practical ob
stacles have arisen to numerous sug
gestions made. Major General Bliss
told the commission of cbjections that
can be raised to many proposals, in
eluding provision for a constabulary.
Hrs attitude was not" revealed but it
was believed he shared the 'view of
many armyofficers that any plan
would depend on a stable Mexican
government. It has been contended
that if the Carranza government is
strong enough to give practical co
operation in forming a border police,
such force wouldn't be needed. The
comm.ission's session was short, the
Mexican members leaving for , New
York for the celebration tomorrow of
Mexico's national holiday.- The ses
sions will be resumed Monday.
MR. BLITCH COMES AGAIN
Editor Star: I hope you will allow
space for enclosed. You have many
readers of your paper who are in
reach of these points and who I am
sure will appreciate the courtesy.
I felt when I started writing those
articles for your paper on the guber
natorial situation that I would soon
convince you of your error, but I find
I am wasting valuable time on you
as you are determined to await the
outcome of court proceedings. How
ever you want to be careful how you
talk about guardians. .You mention
three or four you know and say one
has a pretty wife, etc Now I have a
pretty wife and I expect all the
others have, and we are not going to
stand for such partiality.
Your reference to Mr. Catts as run
ning for governor as an independent
does Mr. Catts an injustice, and I be
lieve after mature thought you will
agree with me. Mr. Catts won out
in the primary, has th'e certificate
just the same as Mr. Trammell or any
of the other nominees, and from your
own position he would not be running
as an independent until the courts
award the nomination to Mr. Knott,
which in my judgment they are dt
going to do. ,
If I understand their, ruling, they
are going to take oral testimony of
the voters of Madison and Hamilton
counties and if they do this it will be
Christmas before they get through,
and then Mr. Catts will be elected and
ready to take his seat. .
Mr. Editor, if you will only be fair
to Mr. Catts, I will not take up any
more of your space. J. S. Blitch. .
