dent Wilson Returns to the Bummer
Capital.
New London, Conn., Sept. 14. Sug
gestions as to what methods shall be
mployed to establish peace on the
Mexican border were submitted to
Major General Tasker H. Bliss by the
American members of the American
Mexican Joint commission.
The officer's opinions were sought
on subjects ranging from tho with
drawal of American troops from Mex
Ico to the possibility of creating an
International police to guard tho bor
der. No conclusion, however, was
reached.
The joint commission dealt wholly
with questions raised by taxation de
crees issued by General Carranza
which affect thf American-controlled
mining properties in Mexico. The
Mexican commissioners explained in
detail the purnoses of the decrees. In
sisting that they were designed to
promot" the mining industry, not to
drive out American capital and con
fiscate Its holdings.
In their conference with General
Bliss, the American commissioners
took under consideration the advisa
bility of proposing such a system of
border patrol that a part of the Mexi
can troops now engaged in this duty
would be released for the pursuit of
bandits at a -distance from :he line.
They considered also the attitude ot
Americans living along the border, as
reported bv General Bliss, and ob
tained from that officer estimates as
to the number of soldiers necessary
to put into effect any of the plans
that have been suggested.
President Wilson returned to Long
