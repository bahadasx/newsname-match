Come, now, and let us reason
together, saith the Lord: though
your sins be as scarlet, they shall
be as white as snow; though they
be red like crimson, they shall be
m wool (Isaiah i 18.)
Reader, you who are in sin, what
excuse have you for living this un
happy , life of sin aud rebellion,
when God extends to you such a
gracious invitation?.
"Come, now, and let us reason
together," he graciously says to
everyone who is straying in the
ways of sin and death..
Though you have lived in rebel
lion to God, tarmpled under foot
His holy, just and righteous laws
made for man's happiness, yet in
Bpite of all your anworthiness
God says, "Come, let us reason
together," '
Though you are all covered with
the blackness of iniquity, you shall
be cleansed and made white!.
Wonderful, wonderful condesen
, sionl The great, alwise Being,
who, by His omnipotent power,
Bpoke into existence this wonderful
aud fathomless universe, stooping
down to reason with man! . The
spirit of this gracious invitation
rads, though you have been a re
bellious, ungrateful creature, yet I
love you.
Turn ye, turn ye from your evil
ways, for why will ye die? (Eze
iel xxxiii 4.)
No doubt the greatest torment
endured by the souls in a lost
world is the remembrance of how
they turned a deaf ear to the lov
ing, compassionate voice of God as
.He tried to lead them to turn away
from their evil, rebellious ways
and be saved be prepared for
Heaven. ' . ,
Reader, will you turn and live,
or will you go on and die? No
one except yourself can settle the
matter. Religion (being prepared
foe a better world ) id a personal
matter with every soul.
' Stop, consider and reason in the
day God has given you. Accept
gracions proposals of yonr lov
rug Creator and live, for why will
ye die? . .'

- A GOOD MOVE.
Waverly, Tenn., September 11
Cutting the plantation up in small
farms of 10, 20 and 30 acres has
started in Humphreys County, and
judging from the, interest which
the movement is exciting in its in
cipienoy, bids fair to reform the
rural life of the oommunity.
This began here several months
ago when a farm of 400-odd acres
was cut into seven farms and sold
at auction. Later another , such
auction took place, each of which
were considered successful, the
owners of the land making money
and several tenant farmers becom
ing the ownerB of homes.
These two netted more than
$10,000 and served chiefly to stir
interest in the project of peopleing
the county with home owners
rather than tenant farmers.
Now the movement has pene
trated Big Bottom, whose corn
lands are rated second to none in
the United States, and a plantation
valued at $75,000 has been adver
tised for said and cut into small
tracts so that they may be bought
by men of small means.
, Two other plantations adjoining
each other and comprising 4,000
acres will be sold in the same way
soon, it is reported.
Facts to Remember.
In his address before the South
ern Cattlemen's Association at
Shreveport, La., recently Prof. W,
A. Cochel of the Kansas Agricul
tural College said investigations in
Kansas showed that the average
acre of that State produced 32 to
33 bushels of corn, while the aver
age acre tin cattle farms produced
between 55 and 60 bushels; also
that the average value of the farm
land of that State was $60 an acre,
while the average value of the beef
cattle farms was $100 an acre.

WHY EDISON
IS FOR WILSON
Thomas A. Edison, lifelong Re.
publican and a strong supporter of
Roosevelt's candidacy for the Re
publican nomination, has made
announcement of his intention to
vote and work for Woodrow Wil
son. Mr. Edison has made the
following statement:
"Not since 1860 has any cam
paign made such a direct call of
simon-pure Americanism, The
times are too serious to talk or
think in terms of Republicanism
or Democracy. Real Americans
must drop parties and get down to
big fundamental principles.
"More than any other President
in my memory Wilson has been
faced by a succession of tremen
dous problems, any one of which
decided in the wrong way would
have had disastrous consequences.
Wilson's decisions so far have not
got us into any serious trouble, nor
are they likely to.
"He has given us peace with
honor. All this talk about the
United States being despised is
nonsense, Neutrality is a mighty
trying policy, but back of it are
international law, the rights of
humanity and the future of civili
zation. "With reference to Mexico, I
think that the President has acted
wisely, justly and courageously.
It was right that the United States
should not have recognized such a
murderous personality as Huerta.
I do not believe that we should
have intervened nor do I believe
that we should intervene now.
"Mexico is a troublesome neigh
bor just now, but war and conquest
is not going to make her a better
one. Both against England and
againBt human slavery the United
States worked out its salvation,
and it was a pretty slow, trying
process.
"It has been said that Wilson at
first was against preparedness.
Perhaps he was, but when con
vinced that intelligent public
opinion was overwhelmingly in
favor of it, he changed. That is
the proper thing for our Presfdent
to do. A President defiant of
public opiniou would be a danger
ous man in our system of govern
ment. "They, say he has blundered.
Perhaps he has. But I notice that
he usually blunders forward."
CHINA'S GREAT NEED.
An American traveler, whose for
eign creed was whatever religion
any people have is "good enough
for them," and that there is no
reason why Christianity should be
substituted therefor, on a recent
visit to China was granted an audi
ence with one of the two or three
men who are known to the world
statesmen as "the brains of the
China of today and tomorrow."
The usual honorific greetings
were followed by eager questions
as to the state of China, and finally
the traveler asked what, in the
mind of the distinguished Chinese,
was the need of China today.
Instantly came the simple reply,
"Christianity, of course." ,
"You astonish me," said the
American, "I would suppose that
you would have named new busi
ness methods, a new and progres
sive administration, education, or
such. Why do you say, 'Christi
anity, of course ?' "
".Because its the only thing that
goes deep enough,"' said the emi
nent Oriental. "China needs all
those things that you mention, and
many, many more, but it needs
Christianity first, because that un
derlies all the rest.
"Take a single instance. We
have gold mines in China, one of
which would make your Klondike
look 'like thirty cents,' as you say.
It is gold which is easy to work:
But we can not work it. Why not?
Because if we were to fill our canal
boats full of it and start toward
the coast, every village mandarin
through whose .boundaries our
boats passed would extort his bribe
to let them pass, and every other
official, little and big, would, as you
say, 'get his,' too. And when,,we
reached the coast we would have
no gold at all and would be lucky
if we still had the boats.
"No, China can never be reform
ed until it has new business prin
ciples and governmental honesty,
and it can never have these until it
has a' new moral sense, and it can
never have that until it has become
Christian.
"I myself am a rich man, as wealth
goes in China, but I have not one
copper cash invested in China.
They are all invested in American
securities because America is a
Christian country, and that is the
only country where any invest
ment is 6afe."

TAX PAYERS
PRAISE ROADS
Waverly, Tenn., September 11
Humphreys County's good roadx,
for which the people are paying
$250,000, have, been pronounced a
success even.before the eouatruc
tiou. ..company, which has the con
tract, has completed its work.
The cutting down of the hills
and draining of the roads has
caused many who were opposed to
the bond issue to change their
minds iu favor of the roads and
their maintenance.
A movement is now on foot, or
rather is being advocated by our
public-spirited citizens, to hard
surface all the roads recently con
structed. This will cost an addi
tional sum of $150,000, but will
require no further tax levy, the
special levy having been made
large enough to take care of the
project.
BAD EGGS.
During the past summer Cam
den seems to have been flooded
with stale, rotten eggs. Private
individuals bring them in without
candling aud dump them on the
local grocers, who, in turn, sell
them to the consumers, who plead
for protection, and yet they are
not using that to which they are
entitled, for the 'grocer has no
more right iojsell-a rotten egg
than he has to sell a rotten ham.
If consumers will refuse to pay for
rotten eggs the grocers will proba
bly be a little more careful about
what they buy and sell.
Shoot the Buzzards.
"Shoot the buzzards," says Dr.
C. F. Luckey, State veterinarian
of Missouri. They are liable to
spread many different contagious
diseases among animals. The hog
cholera season is here, and the
buzzards aid to spread this disease.
A few outbreaks of authrax have
occurred in Arkansas. Anthrax is
equally as bad as hog cholera.
Buzzards are likely to carry anth
rax from Arkansas to Tennessee,
so it is safer to shoot the buzzards
and burn them.
A great many people have been
led to believe that there is a law in
Tennessee against killing buzzards.
This is a mistake. The State vet
erinarians realize that buzzards
are a menace to live stock produc
tion in Tennessee, and, therefore,
should be killed and burned.
Food Qamblers Caught.
New York, September 5. Food
dealers who gambled ou the ex
pected isolation of New York from

deep-laid plot.
Prices suddenly collapsed with
the averting of the strike. The
food gamblers were caught with
vast quantities of supplies on their
hands. One speculator is reported
to have lost hundreds of thousands
of dollars.
