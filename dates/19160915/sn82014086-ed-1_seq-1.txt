equivocal terms that Japan had not

Department officials let it be known
that the statements were entirely sat
isfactory and that inquiries regarding
tne new treaty, over which they had
been considerably perturbed, probably
would not be pressed further.

RAT FLEAS RESPONSIBLE
FOR SPREAD OF PARALYSIS
Is the Latest Theory Advanced by
Medical Research Men.
New York, Sept. 14. That rat fleas
are responsible for the spread of in
fantile paralysis is the theory advanc
ed here by medical research men who
have been experimenting to determine
the carrier and transmitter or tne
disease, according to an announce
ment tonight by Dr. Haven Emerson,
city health commissioner.
The commisisoner stated that ex
periments with almost all bugs and
vermin had been abandoned as of no
value and that attention now is be
ine concentrated on fleas, this idea
having first meen suggested by Dr.
Mark Richardson, secretary of the
Massachusetts department of health
who lost two of his children of the
disease.
"The flea theory is based on careful
observation," Dr. Emerson said, "but
the suspicion has not yet been fully
verified."
It was pointed out tonight that one
C. T. Brues of Harvard university,
who studied the disease here for six
weeks, is working on the flea trans
mission theory, as are surgeons of the
United States public health service
and the Rockefeller Institute for Med
ical Research.
Commisioner Emerson, however, in
sists that the chance of spreading the
disease from one person to another is
bv far the greatest.
Lt was pointed out onight that one
reason why infantile paralysis had
not appeared in various children's in
stitutions probably was that rats and
the f.eas they carry were absent
there.
GERMANS SEIZE 750,000,000
FRANCS BELGIAN MONEY.
Use
of German Currency Has Been
Forced Upon Belgium.
Havre, France, Sept. 14, 5 p. m.
Aloys van de Vyvere, Belgian minister
of "finance, today authorized the fol
lowing statement:
"The news of the seizure of 750,000,
000 francs in the Belgian national bank
by the German military administra
tion in Brussels is probably true, al
though no official confirmation of it has
yet been received.
"The German military rule has com
pelled the payment of contributions
levied upon Belgians to be made in
francs at par value with the mark at
1.25 francs, and it has at the same time
paid for its requirements in Belgium
in marks. German currency has been
forced uoon the country in this man
ner to replace Belgian currency.
"The German government summon
ed the directors of the national bank
and endeavored to compel them to
transfer the cash in the bank to the
German government. The directors re
fused and one of 'hem, M. Carlier, was
thereupon arrested and is kept as
prisoner, where we do not know.
I think the civilized world should
know of this cruelty to M. Carlier."
A despatch from The Hague under
date of Sept. 11 quoted the Belgischa
Dagblad as announcing that the Ger
man authorities has seized 30,000,000
pounds placed in the Belgian national
bank in consequence of the suspension
of the moratorium, the Germans of
fering to pay 5 per cent, interest and
return the money two years after the
close of the war.
A NEW WORLD'S RECORD
IN NAVAL GUNNERY.
Has Been Made by the New Super-
dreadnought Pennsylvania.
Washington, Sept. 14 A new world's
record in naval gunnery has been made
by the new super-dreadnought Penn
sylvania, the navy department an
nounced tonight. Credit for the feat
is given to the big battleship's 12-
inch rifles, mounted as a main battery
in four turrets, which, on a simulta
neous discharge in a recent trial, reg
istered five hits on a small target 11
miles away. At that distance a tar
get is not visible to the gunners.
Records or the nignest scores ever
made under similar circumstances
have been examined by naval officers,
but none equalling that of the Penn
sylvania has been found.
The Pennsylvania is the first vessel
to have its entire main battery mount.
ed three guns to a turret and her per
formance is declared by ordnance and
construction officers to be the final
answer to critics opposing the three
eun turret system.
The Nevada and OKianoma, also new
additions to the navy, are equipped
with two three-gun and two two-gun
turrets. Neither of these has been
able to cope with - the Pennsylvania,
although both made unusually good
scores during their preliminary prac
tice.
The Pennsylvania and Oklahoma at
the present time are undergoing their
final tests and. navy department re
ports say, are rulhlling tne required
specifications in a highly satisfactory
manner.

GENERAL BLISS TO APPEAR
BEFORE JOINT COMMISSION
When Discussion of Border Problems
is Renewed Today.
New London, Conn., Sept. 14. Majo
General Tasker H. Bliss, assistant
chief of staff of the United States
army, is expecte dto appear before the
American-Mexican commission tomor
row, when discussion of border prob
lems is renewed. He will be the first,
and possibly the only, witness to be
interrogated by the commission in
joint session, as it is said to be the
desire of the American commissioners
to keep the door closed against an
endless succession of persons who wish
to be heard, thus delaying the delibera
tions. It was thought advisable that
General Bliss should explain in person
to the Mexican commissioners the
military aspects of the various border
plans as seen by high army omcials of
tne United States.
No definite plan for border patrol
has taken shape as yet in the minds
of the commissioners. The Americans
were long in conference with General
Bliss again today. It was Indicated
that the proposal which has appealed
most strongly so far for the repre
sentatives of the Washington govern
ment was that a border constabulary
be created to operate as a police force
along both sides of the line. It was
suggested that the force be composed
or rormer soldiers of both countries.
under joint control, and that the ex
pense be shared by both governments.
Details of the plan, however, have
not been worked out.
