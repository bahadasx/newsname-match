GEO. SNYDER LEAVES SALEM,
Printer Accepts Mechanical Fore
manship of Coos Bay Times.
George C. L. Snyder of the Elliott
Printing house, Salem, has accepted
the foremianship of the mechanical
department of the Coos Bay Times,
Marshfield, and will leave for thf.
coast city a week from tomorrow. In
Salem Mr. Snyder has been a live
wire, not only in the printing busi-
ss, but in the musical circles of
the capital, ami as a member of he
Cherrians and the Salem Ride club,
On the recent Chen-inn excursion to
Marshfield he was editor of the Cher
rian Gazette. When informed by The
Observer yesterday morning of
George's planned move, the A. V. II.
Snyder family was surprised.
The Oregon Statesman on the front
page yesterday morning added flic
following statement to the news story
of Mr. Snyder's departure: "George
Curtis Lee s absence will be serious! v
felt by Salem live wires."
Pastor Will Not Resign.
A controversy that arose over the
employment bf an evangelist at The
Dalles has severed the friendly rela
tions between the Rev. Leon Myers.
pastor of the Christian church of
that city and his congregation. At
a mass meeting they asked his resig
nation, but he has refused to res.rn,
saying that he has not had opportu
nity to present his side of the arsu
ment. Rev. Myers was pastor of the
Dallas Christian church for over two
years, going from here to oilwton
about four years ago. Hfe has been
in eastern Oregon for the past two
years.
Band to Give Concerts.
The Dallas Concert band, under the
direction of Mr. Fred Keil, will fur
nish music at the fair grounds again
this season, and for these entertan
ments, afternoon tnd evening, has ar
ranged a particularly interesting pro.
gram. Last year these band concerts
proved a pleasing feature of the fair,
and that they will again this week
goes without saying, inis musical
organization has a membership of
about twenty-five, and at the evening
concerts nearly the full band will be
present and participate in the pro
gram. .
Hand Hurt in Planer.
P. F. Friesen is nursing a bad hand
this week as a result of a contact
with a planing machine at the North
Dallas mill last Friday. While cut
ting a board his hand slipped and
struck the planer which neatly trim
med off the back of the member, ex
posing the bones in places. The
wounds were dressed by Dr. Star-
buck.
Monmouth Has New Mayor.
J. Graham was selected by the
Monmouth council Monday night to
serve as mayor for the unfinished
term of John L. Murdock who has
moved to Yamhill. This is Mr. Gra
ham's second try at the mayoralty
place. Once before in his 11 years'
residence in Monmouth Mr. Graham
was mayor, the first time elected by
the people to serve for a full term,
one year.
Car Shortage Quit Jobs.
Chagrined because they were laid
off when the Southern Pacifie could
not deliver gravel ears, fourteen Rus
sian shovelmen for the Montague-O'
Reilly street paving company in Me
Minnville quit their jobs Tuesday and
returned to Portland. However, their
places were readily filled by McMinn
Tille laborers and the 60 blocks of
hard surfacing work will continue.

Charles L Bratcher of Perrydale.
officer of the Hughes Alliance club,
says "Thanks" for tie Hughes but
tons and pictures.
The fifth annual Polk county fair
will open its doors at .the county fair
grounds in Dallas next Tuesday.
Following a year of good crops,
and with favorable weather now ap
parent for the fair, the event prom
ises to eclipse all of its kind since
the institution had its inception, five
years ago. From various parts of the
county come promises of loyalty to
the fair, both from the standpoint
of attendance and from interest in
furnishing displays, and the officials
and management are feeling confident
that this year will see by far the
best fair Polk ever held. A special
feature of this year's fair,, too, is
the exhibit of the Polk County Jer
sey club, members of which have giv
en notice that they intend to bring in
portions of many of the high class
herds and this alone will be an un
usual drawing card. Polk county Jer-
seyB are. the quality cattle .of the Pa
cific coast, and Polk leads all North
west counties in number of registered
Jersey cows. t
But Polk county's achievements are
not confined to Jersey cows alone, a
a visit to the ' fair next week will
show. Some of the finest grains',
grasses and legumes to be found any
where, will also be on exhibit; horses.
sheep, swine, goats and poultry will
claim their admirers; vegetables and
fruits will be artistically arranged
for both quality and size; cut flowers
and household art work are offered
special inducements; the domestic
science department will have a very
large display and tne baby snow is
creating considerable interest. Aside
from all this the amusement features,
including the auto parade and vari
ous contests, and the attractions to
be put on by- th Araold-'Awraseinent
Company will also be drawing cards.
The eighth annual school fair, which
is being held in conjunction with the
county fair, is the big part of the
whole show to a lot of youngsters
over the county. That they have tak
en an interest in the fair is shown by
the way entries are being made. There
is keen rivalry among the county's
boys and girls for the prizes and
their exhibit will be well worth see
ing.
Music by the Dallas band, singing
by Hallie Parrish Hinges, an address
by Governor Withycombe, are some
of the features of the program, which
is given complete on another page.
DANGER IN HIGH TUITION

TOR RAPS SCHOOL BOARD.

Writer Residents of East Polk
Agree With Him.
"A great many factors are respon
sible," says a contributor to the Sa
lem Capital Journal, "for the move

tnese J. snail call attention to one
only which inquiry has found to be
the most powerful cause for the ten
dency to abandon farm life. It is
the want of proper facilities for the
'advanced education of rural children
"Oregon has wisely provided for
the advanced education of such of
her country boys and girls as desire
to pursue their studies beyond the
provision made m their district
schools. These may attend any hieh
school in the state and the. amount
of their tuition, computed on actual
cost of instruction, will be assessed
against the school districts in which
they reside and paid into the city
school fund.
I feel our school board is mak
ing a great mistake by trying to read
into the law something that will en
able them to charge an increased
rate of tuition sufficient to cover in
terest on investment, deterioration of
buildings and similar items. If such
additional amount is not paid by the
district the sum can be collected from
the farmer by suit at law
"It will not take the average farm
er long to decide how to- settle these
difficulties. Instead of being harass
ed about the amount of tuition to be
paid for the instruction of his chil
dren he will rent a house in the city
where he and his family will reside,
thereby obviating the payment of any
tuition at all. By the end of the
school years they will have found city
life so charming that a tenant will
be placed in charge of the old farm

"Apparently some of our people
are proceeding under the assumption
that they have an inalienable right to
support both of home and municipal
ity from profits in the traffic which
comes from the farms. If any enter
tain such views they will prove not
only a pleasant dream. A rude awak

consciousness through the prodding
of the steadily increasing cost of our
daily food. And the end is not in

THE COUNTY FAIR
"The county fair is coming back
The poster sheets are everywhere,
And almost everybody now
Is whooping up the county fair.
We've had our fill of, aeroplanes
We want to see the big fat hog,
The patent chum, the trotting dog,
The new device that beats a cog,
And work around through the catalogue
At the county fair.
"We've always missed the county fair
Its inner and its outer track
The dancing saddler, and the bull
About four feet across the back,
We're weary of awful war talk
We want to hear the whistles blow,
The horses neigh, the roosters crow,
The blooded cattle when they low,
And the shrill-voiced starter shouting 'Go!'
At the county fair.
"It seems as if the world grows cold,
And people nowadays don't eare
For other people in the warm
Old manner of the county fair,
We're tired of bowing here and there.
We want to shout 'How are yon DanT'
'Hello there, Bill!" and Howdy Ann!'
And get warm clasp of the band
From every woman, child and man
At the county fair.
"The county fair is coming back
And that is probably as welL
A little more, and everyone
Had disappeared within bis shell.
The good old plan was better far
We want to meet the human raee
In some well -decorated place.
And be right human for a space
Because of coming face to face
At the county fair."

THIS WEEK AND NEXT.
Chapman's and Elliott's Dryers Op
erating; All Growers Will

It will require several more days
of nice weather to complete the grain
harvest in this vicinity. Some oats
are still standing, a good deal of the
wheat is still unthreshed and clover
hulling operations are still active. Be
cause of heavy dews at night thresh
ing is delayed for several hours each
day and this is drawing out an al
ready long delayed season. Another
week of sunshine, however, will see
the crop practically cleaned up.

Joy to the boarding house keeper;
gloom to the star boarder! The prune
Dicking season on one or tne Best
crops Polk county has had in years is
on. Chapman's and Elliott's dryeis
have been operating this week be
cause the heavy crops necessitated an
early start. Dr. Mark Hayter start
ed a half crew picking today. H. A.
Woods may start today on his 01
acre bearing orchard. H. L. Crider
may begin picking tomorrow. D. N.
Kaegi has been drying petite prunes
this week, v
The price being offered now is 6
cents a pound for the dried1 fruit with
6V2 understood, if the grower will of
fer to contract at that price. Grow
ers are waiting for the market to
come to 7 cents again. Seven and
better was quoted earlier in the sea
son nut the market nas aroppea
slightly. Several smaller growers
near Polk station and in the bait
Creek district contracted at seven
cents earlier in the season.
Ralph Riggs, Harry Butz, K. B.
Kugle, Dr. Mark Hayter, and H. L.
Crider .are among the growers who
plan to start not later than Monday
on their orchards. The recent rains
have hurt the prunes but very lit
tle, growers say, and the crop will be
a large one. Nearly every prune man
reports that the prunes are large and
look as though they contain better
than the average amount of sugar. In
the dried fruit the amount of sugar-'
is one of the determining measures
of a good crop as the sugar makes
the dried product heavy.
In pounds the following growers
have made an estimate of their 1916
crops: wiapman, on acres in oear-
ne,- 10,000 bushels at 2t ponnHa to

60,000 pounds; H. L. Crider, 7,000
bushels at 20 pounds, 140,000 pounds;
R. P. Riggs, 50 acres in bearing, 4,000
boxes at 20 pounds, 80,000 pounds;
Harry Butz, 3,000 bushels at 20
pounds, 60,000 pounds. .
Prune picking season will last .
few days into October and until that
time the orchards and dryers of the
county will be hives of activity. A
little short-handed, prune men al
ready are discussing with hop men
and farmers the feasibility of an em
ployment bureau in connection with
the Dallas Commercial club with
paid secretary in charge from August
15 to September 20. The seasonal
or itinerant worker is the man upon
whom the farmer or other exploiter
of the soil depends for assistance at
harvest time and the annual question
is distribution of men and women
helpers to the jobs throughout the '
country. An employment bureau such
as suggested would be a eentral place
where the laborer and employer could
meet.
Walker Is Assistant Coach.
Dean Walker of Independence has
been made assistant football coach of
the University of Oregon team and
has gone to Eugene to take np his
residence until after Thanksgiving.
Mrs. Walker is with him.
