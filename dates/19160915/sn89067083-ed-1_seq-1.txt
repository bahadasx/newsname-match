GOLD CORD A WAR PERIL
Heavy Leases ef Officers In European
War Caused by Badges of
. Rank.
Parti. One of the earliest tenons
of the wtr was that of the danger to
officers In allowing them to wear
badges of their rank, gold cord around
their coat sleeves, gold decorations
oa their headgear, etc., which marked
them out to the enemy's picked Shots
snd resulted In unnecessary and
avoidable losses among them. Tills
lemon was learned, and now It has be
come so difficult at the front to iden
tify an officer that a failure to salute
!s orerlooked on this ground.
There seems, however, a chance that
this danger Is being revived by the
regulations making the wearing of
chevrons obligatory. These chevrons
re In the form of an Inverted T and
are worn on the right arm between
the elbow and shoulder to denote that
the wearer has been wounded, and oa
the left to show the. length of time
he has been at the front, one showing
one year of active service, two for 18
months. They sre worn In sll sorts
of material and colors, officers wear,
log them In gold and silver. When
worn on leave or during convalescence
their visibility is a good point, but at
the front they draw upon their wear
er the same danger that badges of
rank formerly did.
