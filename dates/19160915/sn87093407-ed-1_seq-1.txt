baby in her arms from the blistered deck to
an awaiting lifeboat.

fainted, was carried to safety. Mrs. Ashton
grasped the baby and went over the side of
the ship with it. Her hand was crushed be
tween the lifeboat and the steamer in the
attempt.
Mrs. Ashton lives at 1151 16th ave. N.,
Seattle, and her husband is on the way here
to attend her.
