"Gentkcca: -At a meeting of a spe
;ciai committee, or the, Maul Chamber
. of Commerce appointed to represent
me Maul Chamber", of Commerce in
considering the new tariff of the In
ter-Island Steam Navigation Company
and make representations on- behalf
of that ,body: to your -commission.
, wbich meeting was held on the 12th
dly of September, the new tariff and
the service given by the Inter-Island
Steam Navigation Company were fully
discussed and the committee on be
nalf of - the Maul Chamber of Com
merce wishes to make' the following
representations to your commission.
"First: Rates on Cattle f ;
"We believe that the' raise on the
freight on cattlj from Kahului in view
of the excellent shipping facilities Is
unwarranted, unreasonable and dis
criminatory. The freight rate on cat
tle from Kahului to Honolulu Is 15 per
head, to which Is added a wharfage
charge of 60c per head. The cattle
are driven on the steamer from "the
vharf and with practically no loss of
time to the steamer. Air. William
Walsh, superintendent of the Kahului
- Railroad Company, informs this com-
mittee that on one occasion 52, head
of cattle were loaded on the steamer
. Claudine at Kahului within 60 seconds
after the time they were driven upon
the wharf. This is of course the best
. time of .which record haa been kept
but Mr. Walsa further informs this
committee that the average time for
loading 50 head of cattle at Kahului
is not " more', than 15 minutes, and
that the loading is done with practi
cally no risk of injury to the cattle.
"As a comparison attention fa called
to the fact that the rate on cattle from
Kaupo is 5 per head, where the cat
tle must be swum to the small boats,
towed to $he steamer and hoisted on
the steamerby the ateamer'a crew,
under which condition the time con
sumed ana - labor Involved is very
much greater. .' s
"On account of , the excellent facili
ties at Kahului a special rate prevails
on pigs from Kahului to Honolulu and
we believe that for. the same reason
the shippers of cattle from Kahului
should be entitled to the same consideration..'-':
- ' k
"Second; General . Merchandise
"We believe' that, .considering v, the
eer1ce .given. the - freight rates on
general ' merchdis) I are exorbitant
There are Innumerable complaints as
to service. Claims for loss or damage
in transit are absolutely Ignored and
the company -and it' agent ahow no
willingness tq accommodate the ship
ping public In ny particular.1
Third: Freight to Way Ports v
The L-L steamship Claudine con
sistently refuses to accept freight
from Kahului for Hana and Kipahulu
and ; way ports -while accepting such
shipments from Honolulu and this ac
tion -i works unjust discrimination
against Maul merchants. As an in
stance, while this committee was in
session a report came in from Mr.
E. a Meilor at Kipahulu, stating that
he had Just been informed by the of
ficers of the steamship Claud
ine that he coaid expect no freight

' Our investigation has shown, says

"that territorial and federal officials
are placed in different classifications

business in the territory. Whereas
federal officials pay a, rate of only
$1 for $1000, territorial employes are
required by the same companies, to

It is certainly . high. Ume that some
definite steps be taken to remedy
