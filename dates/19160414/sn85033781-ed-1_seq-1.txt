CONTROLLING THE
SAN JOSE SCALE
Timely suggestion for fruit
growers, by Prof, L. R.
Tuft, State Inspector of
Nurseries and Orchards
Tbe San Jose scale is present in many
orchards in the southern half of Mich
igan and, unless active measures are
taken for its control, it will not only kill
the trees now infested but will spread
to others and make it difficult for those
who are spraying tiieir orchards to save
their trees.
The state law requires all persons hav
ing trees or shrubs infested with this iu--sect
to effectually spray, or destroy them,
an order that the spread of the infect
may be checked. The law also makes
it the duty of this office to specify the
treatment which will be acceptable.
The standard remedy is lime-sulphur
solution, and it may be used at the rate
of one part to eight parts of water, if it
contains 24 per cent of sulphur in solu
tion. The amount of water should be
reduced proportionately for weaker solu
tions. The sulphide of sodium, known as
Soluble Sulphur Compound, will also be
accepted if used at the rate of 15 to 20
pounds for 50 gallons of solution.
Scalecide, one of the miscible oils may
be used at the rate of one pari to fifteen
parts of water.
These remedies may be used while tbe
trees are dormant, ami are most effect
ual when applied just as the leaf buds
begin to open, but before the blossoms
show a pink color.
The, beoetits from these remedies will
depend almost entirely upon the thor
oughness with which they are applied;
and, to get Che best results tbe trees
should be sprayed from four sides, in
case proper care was not taken and tbe
young scales appear on tbe trees during
the Krst week in July, the trees should
be sprayed between July 10 and 15th,
using one gallon of lime-sulphur solu
tion in 25 gallons of water. This should
not be used upon peach or Japan pium
trees. Care should also be taken in
using "Soluble Sulphur Compound"
upon the foliage, particularly with paris
green or arsenate of lead.
With concerted action there will be
no difficulty in controlling these insects.
The country club met at the home of
Mr. and Mrs. Jay Hinckley last Satur

FIRE IN ANNEX TO
SCHOOL BUILDINGS
Monday morning at about 0:110 the
thrilliug tones of the tire bell awoke
many from their peaceful morning slum
bers. It was discovered that the annex
of the public school building was on
6re. The janitor, Mr. Hanson, had
been over early and started the furnace
Hre so that the building would be warm
and in readiness for the little ones at
school time, and then returned to his
home close by. As he was ou bis way
to tbe barn to milk his cow he looked
up and discovered the building i,o be on
Are. The alarm was immediately sent
in and the tire department was soon on
the scene. A spark from the chimney
had aet Are to tbe roof. This was soon
extinguished and with but very small
damage to the building The interior
did not suffer at all from the fire and
school in this department began on time
as usual.

SPECIAL SESSION
OF SUPERVISORS
Called for April 19. Will
organize and consider
commissioners for the
county road system.
There will be a special session of the
Board of Supervisors for Van Buren
county on Wednesday April 19. This
session is made necessary b) tbe adop
tion of the County Road System, and is
in pursuance af the statute. The county
clerk makes tbe call on the petition of
one third of tbe newly elected board.
Tbe board will undoubtedly organize
for tbe eos iing year, and will then coo
aider tbe County Road system. There
are many things in connection with it
that will receive consideration. They
will decide among other things, whether
there shall be one, two or three road
commissioners and make the appoint
ments, the salary of such commissioners,
and the employment of a county road
engineer. Several candidates have al
ready been mentioned as possible select
ions for county commissioners, among
them being tbe following:- W. T. Davis
and George Wellington Lee of Paw Paw
Robert Tripp, Covert, and a Mr. Dillen
beck, highway commissioner of Law
rence township. It is said that there
will elso be two candidates from South
Haven, ana" Supervisor Kirby of Covert

to be an.ong the members of tbe board
and al so among tbe citizens of the county
that the commissioners should be men
with practical knowledge in road building.

Make Your Farm
Worth More Money
You can do it. Fence it in with honest built
Adrian Fences they look good, are better made
and are best for all around service.
It's easy to put up and take down Adrian Fences
they're so well made it doesn't hurt them.
This makes possible more diversified farming.
Makes more money for you. The improved
appearance Adrian Fences give, will increase the
value of your farm. That increased value covers
a dozen times the cost of putting up the fence.
No danger of damage to crops from cattle when
Adrian Fences are up. Another money saving
feature..
And you can cultivate more ground with this
fence than with old fashioned fences. Still
another saving.
Those are only a few ways; there are others.
Let us show you Ad rian Fences, made by
Adrian Wire Fence Co., Inc.; we are selling milps
of it Drop in next time you are in town.

L
NEEDJTTENTION
Commissioner talks about
Standard Schools. Alle
gan county leads in num
ber of standard schools
Progress in educational lines has been
very rapid in the past ten ears but the
rural schools while much improved have
not kept up with the better village
schools and the boys and girls in the
country do not have the advantages ed
ucationally that come to the children of
graded school districts. Under the pres
ent system we do out believe that this
disparity will ever be removed but we
do believe that the rural school can
be made much better than it is. Schools
of course are only good and bad by com
parison and iu order to "standardize"
educationally to arouse the spirit of im
provement among the people and to lav
out a field of definite achievement th
Department of Public Instruction pro
vides the Standard School plan. A cer
tain degree of excellence in environment
in comfortable and sanitary conditions,
and in the ability and character of the
teacher is fixed upon as necessary for
an efficient sohool. Upon meeting the
requirements the State of Michigan will
set an especial mark of approval in the
form of a metal plate bearing tbe words
"Standard School".
In order that tbe term "Standard"
may be an indication of state and not
local conditions tbe inspection and award
are always made by the Superintendent
of Public Instruction or his deputy.
Allegan county leads the state in the
i xcellency of her rural schools having
30 Standard schools. Van Buren Co.
ranks in the twenties with four schools
of that class; but the people of our
county are going to do much to improve
conditions the coming year as is shown
by the fact that 25 school boards have
asked to have Mr. Otwell who will be in
the county from the 18th to tbe 21st of
this month, visit their school building
and talk over improvements withtbem.
Have you a Standard School in your
district.?
Very Truly,
E. V. Root.

IT'S A GIRL
CRUSHED BENEATH
HIS AUTOMOBILE
Jess Thomas, formerly of Pa v Paw
and well known here, was killed in an
automobile accident near Blair, Neb.
last Friday. He was in the employ of
the Lutz Marble works of that city, and
was on his way to Woodbin la. to put
up a piece of work when the accident
happened. His car skidded over an em
bankment and he was crushed beneath
the car. The remains were taken to
New Castle Perm , his home for
burial. Deceased leaves a widow,
one sister Mrs. Frank Taylor, and two
brothers, Wesley J. and Emmet.
Cutting Diamonds.
The method of cutting diamonds Is
a very delicate one, diamond dust be
ing largely used for the cutting, as no
steel is hard enough for the purpose.
It is remarkable that the diamond cut
ters can cut such small stones into per
fect brilliants, but sometimes there are
cut 100 to a carat, a carat weight be
ing only 8.2 grains, and when shown
in a bit of white paper look like a
number of brilliant minute stars.
The wonder is not that diamonds are
so costly, but that they can be pur
chased for any price within reason,
when the rarity of good stones and the
difficulty of cutting is all considered.
