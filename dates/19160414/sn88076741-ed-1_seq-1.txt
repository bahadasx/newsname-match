'PROGRESS OP THE WAR.
"Fifty days of attack and Verdun still
intact" were significant headlines of a
daily on Monday. The first rush of the
Germans gained ground measured by
kilometers, since then grains have been
measured in meters,—and dead men.
The end his not yet. As late as Sunday
last several heavy assaults were made
by the Germans. Dead Man's Hill to
the northwest and Forts DeDuamont
and Vaux on northeast were the fight
ing points as they were several weeks
ago. The only change in the battle lines
from the latter fighting is the withdrawl
ot the French in the vicinity of "Dead
Man's Hill" which has been the scene of
many sanguinary engagements. The
French still hold the hill.
The resignation of Von Tirpitz, of the
German navy who was supposed to be
the author of the "sinking without warn
ing" policy, has made no difference in
that policy as apparently more ships
have been sunk during the last two weeks
than previously in the same time. The
German answer to the "Sussex" case rias
not yet come to this country but is said
to be that Germany did not sink the
"Sussex"—and while there is strong cir
cumstantial evidence to the opposite, yet
the word of a nation is usually accepted
ss truth. What the Washington author
ities will do in that case is consequently
jret a question.
Russians and Italians send their usual
reports of progress but the map does not
show progress.
In our own "Villanous" war reports
are. so confliction that if they were not
actually -tragical they would be humor
ous, Villa is reported at several places on
the same day, sometimes several days
inarch in front of them. Sometimes he
is with the main body of his troops and
at other times has gone off and bid by
him—it. He has been wpunded in the
hip, on the right leg, and in both legs.
He is being hauled by a carriage over
rough rpads and being oarried in a litter,
ob
Friday we leaned that he had died
fewioe from different onuses.
About the only reliable news is that

SENATOR OR EX-SENATOR
Attention has been called to a law
passed during the 1911 session of the
North Dakota legislature, providing for
an election of a senator from the first
district. Senator A. J. McFadden, of
lb place was elected in 1914 and the
constitution provides that state senators
shall be elected for four years. Mr. Mc
Fadden has his certificate of election for
a four year term commencing Jan 1st,
1915 and as there has-been no coustitu
tional amendment passed to cause his
removal from office, it seems that he will
he the senator from this district until
December 31,1918—Neche Chronotype.
"SESSION LAWS
1911,
CHAPTER
156.
(1) The Eastern part of the county of
Pembina, now constituting the firt legis
lative district, shall be added to and be
come a part ot the second legislative dis
trict, and the said second legislative dis
trict is hereby renumbered and shall
hereafter be, and become known as the
first legislative district, and the term of
the senator from the district so enlarged
and renumbered shall continue for the
period for which he was elected as sena
tor of the second legislative district, and
the said first legislative district shall in
November, 1914, elect his successor for a
term of but two years, and the said dis
trict consisting of the county of Pembina
shall be entitled to one senator and three
representatives."
It was the Pioneer Express that first
called attention to the above law which
makes Mr. McFadden's term only two
years. The law itself is perfectly clear
that the term of the senator from the
first legislative district, elected irf 1914,
shall be only two years. It may be that
under constitutional initations that the
law is no good, but what the law says is
perfectly clear and explicit.
We are not arguing the case for or
against Mr. McFadden. .We only called
the attention of the voters to the matter
because it was news to most people. If
Mr. McFadden can show he is senator
from this First District for the succeed
ing two years the Pioneer Express has
not the slightest objection to offer. We
have no personal objection to him what
ever.
The law as written is a little curious.
The reason is that the writer had several
difficulties to evercom?. The representa
tion was necessarily to be cut down. It
was desirable that the number "First"
be retained for sentimental reasons.
Then the senator from the second dis
trict had still two more years to serve
and it would not do to legislate him out
of office. But under the rule that all
senasors from even numbered districts
are elected at one election and all sena
tors from odd numbered districts are
elected at the subsequent elections, al
ternately, thus making each half "hold
overs" consecutively, this transposition
of the senator from the ranks of the
even-numbered to the ranks of the odd
numbered made the election of his suc
cessor occur on the wrong year.
To overcome these difficulties, the
writer of the statute first buried the dead
body of the old First District in the
grave yard of the Second District Then
he renumbered the new district thus
created, as the "First". Then in order
that the senatorial election might occur
at the same time as the other odd num
bered districts of the state, be made the
term of the senator elected in Novem
ber, 1914, to be only Woyears, and in
that way everything would be smoothed
out satisfactory to every one, but as Mr.
McFadden has a cerificate for a four
year term and wants to finish his job,
there may be a question if the law-writer
fixed things so oompletely as he thought.
Anyhow we are glad that we don
have to fix it up,—and fortunately we
have a supreme court that oan fix up
most any old law, even if they have to
add some patching of their own.

F. A. WARDWELL.
A BUSINESS MEN'S STRIKE.
The theory of the Non-Partisan peo
ple appears to be that all classes of bus
iness men and professional persons are
enemies of the farmers. The remedy
proposed is practically to strike. That
is, the farmers are to ignore the busi
ness and professional people and their
interests, and refuse them official posi
tions while the farmers make laws to
suit themselves. The farmers are also
to boycott the business] men {of local
towns and buy all goods possible form
catalogue hons98. The practical re
sult of carrying out such doctrines wpuld
be a boycott or'strike against {all local
business and professional townspeople.
We are wondering what would happen
if all the town people should retaliate in
kind.
Suppose just|one class of these ene
mies of the farmers, the railway people,
should refuse to do^any work for farm
ers.
Suspose the local merchants refused
to do business with any Non Partisan
farmer.
Suppose the doctors would refuse to
respond to their calls.
Suppose the publishers of the dailies
and weeklies refuse ihem their publica
tions.
Suppose town schools and churches
refused them admittance.
Suppose the blacksmith refused to
shoe their horses, or the shoemaker
mend their shoes.
These are only a few examples of what
the consaquences might be if these "en
emies ot the farmer" were to carry out
the doctrines of the Non-Partisan Lea
gue from the standpoint of the "enemy."
Of course such suppositions are absurd
but the real truth is easiest proved by
carrying the error to the extremes.
(..The fact is clear that all these "people
are interested.in farmers and farming,
just as much as the jarmer himself. It
is equally clear that the farmer himself
i&just as much interested in the busi
ness men. Their interests are mutual,
and they are not enemies* Boycott by
either is self destruction.
CITY FINANCES
The financial statement of the city of
Pembina is published in this issue and
deserves a little attention by the tax
payers. It tells where the money cam$.
from and for what it has been spent.
Incidentally, we may add that along ex
perience with taxpayers and their griev
ances shows that the average taxpayer
does not worry so much as to how much
he pays as he does what is done with the
money. If be is satisfied that the ex
penditures are conservative and economi
cal then he has but"littleor no kick
coming
A few remarks may make the state
ment clearer to the reader.
Referring to the published statement,
it will be found that the general fund
had in cash on Marcc 31st, $1,905.04.
Since that date the city treasurer has
received from the county treasurer
$1,100.64 so that the sum in the general
fund at this date is $2,145.65.
A payment or transfer of $200 from
the general fund to the sinking fund
in May will practically provide for the
complete payment of our 12,000 bonded
debt, as we already have $1,615.63 that
fund, and this $200 and accrued and ac
cruing interest will provide for full pay
ment, in two years when the bonds are
due.
We have in outstanding warrants
which are liens against the city the sum
of $1007.40. Now adding, $74 for accru
ed interest on warrants, $200 transferred
to Sinking fund, and $125 to pay bills on
file but not yet passed we have as the
total debt of the city the sum of $1,407.40
As stated above there is cash on hand in
the general fund to the amount of
$2145.63. So that if we choose to pay all
outstanding debts we could do it and
have $738.28 as a cash surplus, in the
general fund.
This showing has not been made by
being penurious in needed city improve
ments. We have been spending about
$800 a year on our streets and crossings
for the last six years, and leaving these
street improvements out of the total,
this city now owns personal and real pro
perty to at least a valuation of $12,000.
The oity government" has been practi
cally in the same hands for along series
of years. This is the finanoia! result.
No wonder that the voters return them
to office as their terms expire.

But what can we figure from such re
ports as these. High water mark of
1897 about afoot lower than the level of
Third street, was 42 feet.
Last Thursday the report was water
above low water mark, 33 feet. But the
water was 18 feet below the level of
Third street. Eighteen feet and thirty
three feet make fifty-one feet. Has
Third Street been raised some nine feet
since 1897 as the above would indicate?
The same reporter also shows a lot of
anxiety as to whether the ice in this vi
cinity still holds strong. He seems to
think that if such is the case that it will
stop the flow and make the water higher
at Grand Forks. As the water in the
Red would have to rise 73 feet here in
order to make "backwater" at Grand
Forks, the reporter better worry about
what is happening above rather than
elow his city.
Just now we down river people are not
so much interested in knowing how far
it is from the top of the water to the
bottom of the river as we are in knowing
how far from the top of the water it is to
the level of Third street. It isn't "the
tow water mark", of which they seem to
have three at Grand Forks, as it is the
high water mark that we are thinking of
first now.
HOW FAR IS A METER?
The European despatches mostly use
meters and kilometers to express dis
tance. Many people have not learned
the metrical system. For these we may
sSy that a meter is the measure they use
when we would use yards, and a kilo
meter is the unit of measure that takes
the place of miles. The equivalents be
low while not exact are easily remember
ed. A meter is nearly three and one
third feet long. A kilometer is 1100
yards or about two thirds of a mile.
