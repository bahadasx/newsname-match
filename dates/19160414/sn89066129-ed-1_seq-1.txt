Dr. Wheeler's Address
There were more than two hun
dred farmers and towns people out
to hear Dr. II. J. Wheeler, the soil
expert of Boston, Mass., at the
opera house last Monday night.
C. C. Bigger was chairman of the
meeting and previous to intro
ducing the speaker made a fine
farm booster speech himself. Dr.
Wheeler has spent many years as
instructor in agricultural colleges
and at experiment stations and his
address had more to do with the
scientific part of the subject than
with actual farming, but it was
valuable and listen to with close
attention. The object of his lec
tures is to encourage the use of
commercial fertilizers with a view
to increasing the crop yield. Dr.
Wheeler was accompanied by his
assistant, E. W. Cowan, and there
was also interested in the meeting
Jno. J. Hoglen, sales manager,
and A. M. Sherrick of the sales
force of the Empire Carbon Works
of St. Louis.
"Get Your Money's Worth"
Recently Miss Cassie Heath as
signed subjects to a number of her
pupils, and the following on "A
plea for every boy and every girl
to go to the high school," was
handed in by Chrystal Adams of
the Eighth Grade:
Education is the instruction and
discipline which is needed to cor
rect the temper, and form the
manners and habits of youth. To
educate children well is one of the
most important duties of parents
and guardians. An immense re
sponsibility rests on parents and
guardians who neglect this duty.
School work should be considered
by both parent and child as the
most important undertaking in the
child's life.
The object of the public school
is to give every boy and girl an
opportunity to prepare themselves
foi future usefulness.
People who have a good educa
tion haye a better advantage in
business, and in everything else,
than those who have little or none.
While the common high school
does not attempt to do the work of
a normal school in preparing
teachers, yet the subjects are
offered just as complete as the four
years in the average normal school.
It is not nearly so expensive to
take the first four years in high
school and there is the advantage
of being near home.
Boys and girls, "get your
money's worth." Education is not
the preparation for life, but it is
life. :
Parents," are you intending to
send your boy or girl to high
school! If so, why? Have you
in view any occupation for which
you wish to train your child!
Why yes," you say, I want
my girl to become a dressmaker, a
nurse, or. a schoolteacher or I want
my boy to become a doctor, a law
yer, or a merchant." Well if you
do why don't you send them to
high school! That is where they
will learn the desired occupation.
Education is good for every boy
and every girl.
Now, boys and girls, don't you
want your money's worth! Your
parents are paying for you to go
to high school. Don't waste money
for it is too valuable. Get right
down to business nd get a good
education.
Judge Moreheadof Meadville was
a business visitor in Laclede Tues

A SUNDAY SHOOTING
Win. Ausmus Put Four Revolver
Bullets Into A. G. Groes
A serious shooting scrape took
place last Sunday morning when A.
G. Groes was attacked by Wm.
Ausmus at the Groes home in the
west part of town.
For several months rumors have
been afloat that Ansmus was mak
ing threats to kill Groes, charging
Groes had interfered with his do
mestic affairs. They live in the
same block and Sunday morning
the two men met in the alley near
their homes and had some words,
Ausmus finally telling Groes he
was going to kill him that day.
Groes went to his home and soon
saw Ausmus approaching armed
with a revolver. Taking his shot
gun Groes stepped out onto his
porch and commanded Ausmus,
who was approaching the door, to
stop. He did stop for a second
but turned and again advanced
toward Groes who raised his gun
and snapped it but being set on
safety it failed to explode and then
Ausmus began shooting, the shot
taking effect in Groes' throat. The
men clinched and in the fight
Ausmus shot five times, four of the
balls taking effect, two in Groes'
neck and two in the side and back
of his head. As Groes lay on the
ground Ausmus kicked him as he
worked at reloading his revolver.
A neighbor woman ran in and
clinched Ausmus and preventing
him finishing the job he had
started. These are substantially
the facts as gathered by those who
investigated the matter.
Ausmus was placed under arrest
by Marshal Power and taken before
Justice Garside and released on a
$500 bond. As the seriousness of
Groes injuries become known the
prosecuting attorney set the bond
aside and ordered Ausmus taken to
the county jail. He remained in
jail until Tuesday when he was re
leased on a $1000 bond and prom
ise to keep the peace. The prelim
inary hearing was set for Wednes
day but was continued to Saturday,
April 29.
It is thought that only two of
the balls found lodgment, the
other two being deflected or passed
out. Groes seems to be holding
his own with a fair chance for re
covery. W. C T. U. Institute "
