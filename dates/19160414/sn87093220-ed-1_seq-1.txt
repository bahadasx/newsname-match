Trainmen Demand An
swer from Companies
by April 29
The Aberdeen Chamber of Com
merce and Hoquiam Commercial club
this week conferred, through the for
mer's executive board and the latter's
directors and transportation bureau,
with officials of the Northern Pacific
and Milwaukee railways over the con
troversy between transportation lines
and trainmen. The sentiment of both
organizations, as expressed by reso
lutions, favored the submission of the
trainmen's demands for shorter work
ing hours, involving a cost to the rail
way companies of $100,000,000, to arbi
tration. This procedure the trainmen
are opposing.
Twenty-five representative Aberdeen
citizens, including the Chamber's exe
cutive committee, sat at luncheon at
the Hotel Washington yesterday noon
with P. M. Metcalfe, special represent
ative of the first vice president; I. L.
Pell, advertising agent, and Supt. W.
C. Albee of the Northern Pacific; and
J. H. Glnet, western immigration agent,
and A. B. Grindell of the Milwaukee.
It was explained that at the present
time trainmen receive 28 per cent of
the payroll of railways .although rep
resenting but 18 per cent of the em
ployes. The railways have until April
29 to answer the men's demands.

PORTABLE PHONE
OF ALUMINUM IS
READY FOR USE
Forest Officers This Season Will Have
Light Field Instruments for
Fire Work.
A portable telephone, made of alumi
num and weighing 2% pounds, design
ed by a forest officer, R. D. Adams,
of Missoula, Mont., will be part of the
regular equipment of patrolmen on the
national forests during the coming
held season. In fact, 100 of these in
struments have already been received
I in Portland and will be distributed for
use this summer on the government
forests of Oregon and Washington.
This instrument is regarded as a
great improvement over the set for
merly used, which weighed ten pounds.
It is said that a field man 'equipped
with this new telephone, a few yards
of light emergency wirj, and a short
piece of heavy wire make the
ground connection,', ciU in any
where along the 20,'0Q Kilts or more
of forest service telepnßie lines, and
get in touch with fWiUtitfuarters of
a supervisor or a dis^^wranger.
To talk, one end of the emergency
wire is thrown over the telephone wire,
and the instrument Is connected *to
the ground wire, the end of which
must be thrown into the damp earth or
into water. Contact with the line wire
is made possible by removal of the
insulation from a few inches of the
; emergency wire. The Adams Instru
ment does not ring the bell of the
receiving telephone, but instead causes
a screeching sound from a small meg
aphone-shaped apparatus known as the
"howler."
Thorough tests of the instrument
have been made this spring, and the
results were very satisfactory, even
on a 109-mile stretch. Forest officers
say that these portable telephones will
be especially valuable in reporting
fires and other emergencies, and will
supplement, in many ways, the regu
lar telephones installed at look out
points and ranger stations.
CLUB GETS LEASE

which has been a busy body of late,

WEST END BOYS
FOR TAKING MAIL
Postal Authorities May Make Example
of Youths Who Scatter Mail
from Boxes
Some boys in the west end of the
city are about to get into trouble
with the postal authorities for tak
ing mail from the boxes placed on
Jeffries street, in which is placed the
mail for those living west of that
street and beyond the limits of the
carrier district. The mail has been
taken from these boxes several times
recently and found scattered in the
adjacent brush. The law imposes a
heavy penalty for this offense. It is
the aim of the authorities to make
an example of the guilty boys, and
efforts are being made to discover
them.

BE REPAIRED

Council Heeds Plaint
from Residents Over
Slides.
MILK ACT HELD UP
Mayor Doubts Right of
City to Demand Bot
tle Delivery
Tribulations of B street property |
owners, and of the city itself, over j
the slides of last winter, were con-1
sidered at Wednesday night's council
session. Mayor J. M. Phillips brought
the matter up and was authorized to
appoint a committee who should con
fer with the property owners and ar
range for the city's repairing the
street and for the property owners' in
consideration of such action, releasing
the city from further liability.
The city, declared the mayor, had |
a moral if not a legal liability in the
matter. Councilmen Walker, Fraser
and Egerer constitute the committee
■which, with the city engineer and
city attorney, will attempt to redress
the wrongs of B street residents.
Make Good Job on B Street
The council, while on the job, took
tip the condition of B street's planked
extension to the city water works and
empowered the street committee to
repair it so that the heavy auto truck
which Phipps ft Watson are using to
deliver 2,000 cords of wood to the
pumping station may be continued in
service. To complete the good work,
bids were ordered advertised for con
struction of the Wishkah road through
the Stewart property, along the route
dedicated by Mrs. Jean B. Stewart.
In an endeavor to keep the furnish
ing of material for the Wishkah pipe
line at home, City Engineer L. D.
Kelsey reported that he had secured
additional bids on the 2,000,000 feet
of pipe staves. The Pacific Lumber
agency will furnish the rough stock
at $22.50 a thousand feet and the Aber
deen Manufacturing company will trim
and groove, tow and unload the staves
for $5.75 a thousand feet. Total cost,
$28.25 a thousand, is a bit under the
lumber agency's first bid of $30 a thou
sand for finished staves. The bids
were laid over for a week for consider
ation by the council as a whole.
More Street Improvements.
Report of the street committee was
adopted, recommending construction of
concrete sidewalk on the west side of
Rroadway from Heron to Hume. Street
Superintendent H. E. Fear's recom
mendation that an old trestle on F
street between McKinley and Hnnna
avenue be torn down, was adopted.
Resolution was adopted providing for ;
Improvement of West Second from M !
to Washington street, by laying 30- j
foot asphalt or concrete road and 6-toot
sidewalks. May 10 is fixed as date
for protest.
Claims for rebates on first and sec
ond fill district work were allowed
from about 100 property owners, sub
ject to the city attorney's final ap
proval.
Milk Ordinance Questionable.
The proposed milk ordinance was re
ferred to the judiciary committee for
a week. Mayor Phillips questioned the
utility of the measure, which provides
that milk must be delivered by all
dairies on routes in sealed bottles, j
which must be filled at starting and
not by the driver while on the trip.
Bridgetenders Dinse and Varney, I
'probably will get $100 a month between ;
them in future, instead of the $90 ;
which the city has been paying for the
work of tending the North Aberdeen j
bridge. The question of handling this
work was left in the hands of the
mayor and street superintendent, with
the tacit understanding that the men
receive more money.
Kick Over Penalty.
A letter from the Toledo Bridge com
pany demanded reasons for the city's
withholding $300 in settling for bridge
material for the West bridge. The
company acknowledged receipt of war
rant for $12,351.25, admitted that a
penalty for delay in arrival of mater
ial was part of the contract but ques
tioned if the city had been damaged
by the delay.

closes that the county treasurer would
have nothing to say concerning the

Weyerhaeuser taxes will have been
delinquent three years until next
