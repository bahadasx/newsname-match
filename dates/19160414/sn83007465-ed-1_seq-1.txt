.Washington, April' 18.?Gen. Cat
ranzn, in a note which arrived at hi
embassy here early to-day, for pr?
sentation to Secretary Lansinft, ask
for the withdrawal of America
troops front Mexico.
The note ratsea a new issue in
situation already macli complexe<
the outcome of which officials at
reticent to predict nntll they liai
(Tone over the communication an
considered what reply the Unite
States will make.
The note was sent to Ellsoeo A:
redondon, the Carranza represent!
tlve in Washingrton, with instru
tlons for its delivery to Seeretai
Lansing "so ending negotiations f<
a reciprocal passing of troops ar
asking for disoccupation of the te
rltory occupied by American trooi
in view of Villa's party having bef
destroyed."
Emphasis is laid on the fact th;
the American expedition was unde
^aken under a misapprehension. A
though acting in good falih the d
claratlon is made that the Uunt<
States has Interpreted the first no
of the de facto government as affec
Ing a definite agreement between tl
}wo nations. But the intention
the de facto government was th
no expedition should be sent in
Mexico until terms and conditions r
latlve to an agreement were d
fined.
Wants Discussion Suspended
The note declares therefore that
consequence of no final agrecanc
having been reached as to the terr
of the treaty to regulate the reel
rooal passage of troops over the lii
"the Mexican government judges
convenient to suspend for the pre
ent all discussion or negotiations
this particular, or founded on t
circumstances that the cxpedlth
sent by the United States gover
ment to pursue Villa is without fou
dation in virtue of the non-oxisten
of a previous agreement formal ai
definite."
What was intended by the note
March 10, it is pointed out, was

which the forces of one and the ot

The note adds, however: "Pro

ment Judged that by reason qX t
time which had transpired for t
purpose of treating a case alreai
passed, the said Incident could n
continue as a proposal for the t

c' by Germany that her submarines reh
cently attacked three merchant sliips
)f carrying American citizens and that
j_ one of them torpedoed a vessel in the |
vicinity of the point where the channel
steamer Sussex was damaged by
1_ and explosion has simplified the task
is of the state department in prepares,
ing for the next step of the United
States in the issue over submarlm
warfare.
*n i
| After receipt in cabled press dispatches
of the last German note it
13 became known that the United States
'e would continue to compile informaie
fion Indicating that German submaas
rines ai'f operating in violation of
)n , international law and that very soon
a communication designed to be the
final word of the American govern10
ment on the subject would go fo
er llerlin.
tr. The state department virtually has
?n completed the collection of facts velating
to all attacks on merchant
ships since the Lusitania. More evidence
in the case of the Sussex, for'd
warded by the American embassy at
nt I .nmlnn ^ t. i?
tyt understood that instructions to Am.
bassador Gerard, accompanied by th1
information gathered bv the departhe
merit, will go forward soon there
after.
re To Consider Xotc
'et The unofficial text of the notu
from Germany was communicated
to President Wilson and Seeretarv
\ o
Lansing to-night. The official text
was expected hourly. It will he 0011es
sidered by the cabinet at its regular
ir- meeting on Friday.
(ls Officials made it clear to-night that
whatever might be the form of the
instructions to Ambassador Gerard
* ' the purpose of the document to be
th handed the German government
d- would be to give notice that the
ty United States considers it has a
great array of evidence tending to
prove that in spite of reiterated asrn
surances and pledges given by Germanv,
peaceful merchant ships oarb
o
^ rving American citizens, or which
might have some aboard, continue
m
! to be victims of illegal attacks.
Officials said the statement in the
Gorman note would be very care
er
fully examined and compared with
the evidence already before the state
department. In view of the admission
that a German submarine was
ns
in the vicinity when the Sussex was
attacked and the array of evidence
indicating: that she was torpedoed,
little doubt is felt here as to the responisbllity
for that disaster, despite
^ the explanation that a sketch made
, by the submarine commander of a
2j n
ship he torpedoed did not correspond
with the description of the Sussex.
rs
lf)l Don't Want Debate
In There is no disposition on the part
id <>' President Wilson and Secretary
Lansing to debate the submarine issue
with Germany. It is declared
id that the principles contended for by
,r_ the United States in a series of notes
tn have been made very elear, and that
Germany has been sufficiently warntc_
ed that more attacks in violation of
as international law would be oonsidored
deliberately unfriendly acts,
ho The possibility of a break in liof
plom.itie relations with Germany.
coupled with an exposition of the
Lc- situation by the president to conas
gross, is constantly In the baeknt?
ground, but the president was repth
resented to-n'ght as being earnestly
a- desirous of avoiding such a step if
if- possible.

sex Case Alone ;
two elements remained to be proved
before action could be taken. The
first had to do with establishing that
the vessels actually were torpedoed;
tlie second with the legality or illegality
of the attacks. Germany has
admitted sinking three of the ships
and evidence in the possession of the
state department strongly 'indicates
that in at least two of the cases tho
acts were in contravention of American
rights.
A Flimsy Plea
It appeared to officials from tho
unofficial version of the note that
the German government had denied
torpedoing the Sussex solelv on that
tlie commanders' reports differed
I from a photograph of the channel
steamer which appeared In a newsoaper.
The description of tlie attack
011 the ship admitted to have been
torpedoed and the story of the explosion
which damaged the Sussex
appeared to be nearly identical. The
note says the explosion of the torpedo
sent against the unidentified
vessel "caused the entire forward
part of the ship to be torn away to
the bridge." The entire forward part
of the Sussex was torn away.
In spite of the fact that the Sun
sex is the chief case now heing cor>
sidered, officials made it plain thai
the next step of the United Sfatet
would rest on the accumulation ot
evidence that American lives were
constantly placed in jeopardy in violation
of their rights.
The German contentions regarding
the attack on the Herwindvale do not
agree with the evid<mce received by
the state department. It is known
that at last two of the survivors
stated that, the vessel was torpedoed
without warning.
It is understood that there also is
a conflict between the evidence h> re
and the German version in the cir.e
of the Englishman. Germany contends
that the ship was sunk "after
