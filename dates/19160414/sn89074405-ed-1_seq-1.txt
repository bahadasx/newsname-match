Mexico government troops on the
Sonora'-Chihuahua boundary, an
nounced that'he is ready to move with
2,500 cavalry and Infantry,' through

time he is requested to do soby Gen
eral Obregon, secretary of war. In the
de facto government.
General Gomes said his column is
amply provisioned and equipped for a
long hard campaign, but the order of
Obregon,- which has been anticipated
for several days, has not yet arrived.
It is Gomez's belief that he will be
sent into Chihuahua with his veterans
to take up the. trail of Villa where the.
American punitive expedition drops it.
He expressed confidence that the
Americans will withdraw from Mexico
and said it appears certain that Villa
has escaped, at least temporarily.
The orders of the movement must
come, from General Obregon, accord
ing to General Gomes, as he alone has
the power-to move troops from One
state, to another.' His movement &B
far as the Chihuahua horde*, was di
rected by General P. Ellas Calles,'iriill

of continued attacks which were be

In gains to us In nearly all sectors.
About 400 prisoner*, also machine

Prospects Fine for Coming Season,
SayW iA.^ Ii. Brown, Ijocal Driller
—Number of Contracts Made.
.Prospects, are fide for the coming
season In the well drilling profession,'
according to A. L. Brown of this city,
former president of the North Dakota
Well Drillers' association.
.During the late months of last fall
until .the earth wass frozen so deeply
that drilling operations were forced to
be .suspended, large numbers of wells
were' drilled in all sections of the
state.
Several contracts have already been
received by Mr. Brown to drill wells
on farms in the vicinity of Grand
Forks as soon aB possible. this spring.
A large number of farmers in the
Red river valley have signified their
intention of sinking flowing wells on
their farms this season.
Very few. square wells have been
dug in the atate for the past few
years, according to Mr- Brown, as the
circular and flowing wells are con
sidered much more sanitary and 'con
venient.
In the valley, the driller is forced to
drill from SO to S0O feet, to strike
water. In one case last year, Mr.
Brown struck a fine flow of water at
77 feet, which is considered to be the
shallowest successful flowing well in
the state.

DOMINANT NOTE
"Much Ado About Nothing"
is Play of Much
Humor. ...
In the play. "Much Ado About
Nothing," which will be given by the
Sock and Buskin society of the uni
versity, under the auspices of the sen
ior class Tuesday evening, Shake
speare has given the boon of laughter
aa perhaps nowhere else in all his
works. Laughter ia the dominant note.
Even' where Prince John, villainous
schemer, leads Claudio to believe that
hia intended bride is unfaithful and to
reject her and. leads "him to a situa
tion that is very near the' tragic, the
audience can never quite lose' the
touch of comedy and mirth that the
dramatist left in all the acts of the
play. In the words of one critic,."the
play that began wKh the silvery laugh
ter of Beatrice. ends in general mirth
which is yet more Joyous."
In "Much Ado About Nothing"
Shakespeare shows that he had reach
ed the polnt-.of Independence in dra
matic creation. He was free. He look
ed the world In .the face and saw it as
it was, dependent no longer on his
earlier teachers. In this play he pre
sents comedy and targedy blended in
to" one picture which Is life. The gay
ety and the brilliancy of the great
world contrasted with the Uttle world
of rural and provincial eOclety are ex
pressed with a confidence and a con
sistency that are remarkable.
The play. "Much Ado About Noth
ing" will be given ait the Metropolitan
theater. Tickets, may be secured from
members of the senior claes or mem
bers of the. Sock and Buskin society.
Holders of tbaiee tickets are'entitled

PRECAUTIONS TO
Native Mexicans Albng
of March Are Being
Disarmed.
Columbus. N. M„ April 14.—Many
Mexicans along the American line of
march in Mexico have been disarmed
by the United States forces, accord
ing to arrivals at the border last night.
General J. J. Pershing, it was said,
regarded this step as necessary to pro
tection of his command since he has
received reliable information that
numbers of Villa's scattered follow
ers are infesting the route.
Colonia Dublan is being made the
most important of the long chain of
bases in Mexico, the arrivals said. For
•its protection semi-circular trenches
have been dug. It has concealed ar
tillery and machine gun batteries.
Some concern has been expressed
by the natives as to the number of
truck trains which have been making
their way to the south, it was said,
the Mexicans apparently believing
each train a new one. The Mexican
estimate of the number of troops In
Mexico was given at 80,000.
The Carranza note asking the with
drawal of the American troops from
Mexico, excited much interest here,
but no information was given out
from official sources concerning any
alteration to be made in General
Pershing's campaign.
Definite instructions were, received
by Major W. R. Sample, command
ant, to turn the six wounded Villistas
now prisoners here, over to the civil
authorities in Deming upon their re
covery.
