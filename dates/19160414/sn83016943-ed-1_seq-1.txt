Lewis D. Bovnton. a wealthy
Ohio lawyer, inserted this para
graph in his will: "I particular
ly warn against attorneys at
law and sincerely trust it may
not be necessary to employ them
in the adjustment of my estate.
My experience has taught me
that they are all dangerous
crooks, expressly educated to ob
tain one's confidence, in order
that they may defraud and rob
with impunity." This is rather
a severe indictment against the
legal fraternity, but it must be
looked upon as the petulant ex
)ression of one who may have
aad more or less cause for his
itterness.
The reason they call it "boot
leg" is because it has a near
kick.
Again the Peanut
The peanut oil industry prom
ises to develop into one of the
most important enterprises in
the State. A mill at Brundidge,
which is one year old, has jus
reported an excellent showing
for the first twelve-month period
of its existence. There are re
ports of other mills soon to be
established.
Many cotton seed oil mills in
this and other states are prepar
ing a part of their equipment for
the crushing of peanuts, and this
is expected to prove a very pro
fitable side-line. Figures on the
possibilities of the industry for
the farmer were published in a
recent edition of the Manufac
turers Record:
The article says:
Another phase of the situation is
the relation of profit per acre to
the farmer between cotton and
peanuts. The average yield of
peanuts is about 40 bushels to the
acre and three-quarters of a ton of
splendid hay. The maximum value
of the peannts for oil production
is, under present conditions, 60
cents a bushel, or $24 an acre. The
value of the hay is $12 a ton, or $8
an acre, making a total of $32 an
acre. On the basis of one-third of
a bale of cotton to the acre, the
.lint and seed together will yield a
return of about $22. Figures ob
tained by the experience of a
great many farmers indicate that
the cost of growing an acre of pea
nuts is no greater than that for an
acre of cotton, if as great that is,
between $14 and $15, including all
labor and expenses. The return or
net profit to the farmer is approxi
mately $10 greater for peanuts than
for cotton. When these facts are
clearly understood by the farmers
of the saudy land districts of the
South there will be little difficulty
so far as their attitude toward the
peanut crop is concerned.
Of course, in all new industrial
efforts, there is the period of get
ting all parts to work together
for a profit; and in this period
there will be many persons
whose high hopes will be sobered
by failure; but failures are the
foundation of success, as they
teach the way to success. This
is not the first we have heard of
the peanut oil industry. A few
years ago there was a considera
ble campaign started and every
body spoke of peanuts. We ap
pear to be coming now into the
second stage, where practical
methods of milling are intro
duced; and there is good reason
to think that better results will
be obtained.
There is proof enough that the
industry should be of value in
Alabama. Peanuts can be grown
readily in nearly'every section of
the state, and as the plant is a
legume, the soil is benefited
wherever a crop is planted- They
are immensely valuable for feed
ing hogs, too. It looks as if Ala
bama has hit upon a sure source
of revenue for the farmer and
the manufacturer. Mobile Reg
ister. An Unnecessary Office
Governor Bilbo very wisely
held up the bill passed by the
Legislature authorizing the ap
pointment by the Supreme Court
of a bond attorney, whose duty
it shall be to pass on the validity
of all State, county, district and
municipal bond issues.
The enactment of this measure
would mean the creation of a
new office, which is not in itself
a serious matter, but in this in
stance it happens to be an un
necessary office.
It is a well-known fact that no
bond issue, State, county, dis
trict or municipal, can be sold in
this country until its validity is
passed upon by Judge Wood of
Chicago, who is recognized as
America's foremost expert on
securities of this character.
The opinion, therefore, of a
bond attorney" employed by
the State would carry no more
weight than that of any other at
torney, since higher legal author
ities must be fully satisfied be
fore a bond issue can be mar
keted. Jackson News.

BtyaqiSt for the Legislature
The Clarion-Ledger has the fol
lowing to say of the legislature
which adjourned last Saturday,
after a session of three mouths and
eight days:
Like all past sessions, and prob
ably all future ones, the pieseut
session of the Legislature has not
been exempt from criticism, borne
of it was undoubtedly deserved,
yet as a whole the body was one
of the best that has assembled at
the capitol in many years. It
was composed in large part of
young, energetic men, a majority
of them with no former legislative
experience. With a few old heads
to point the way and steer the
ship of state clear of the rocks of
recklessness, the record they made
is one they may well feel proud
of.
The members of the Legislature
may have done some things they
should not have done, and may
have left undone some things they
should have done, but they are
entitled to and should receive the
thanks of the people of Missis
sippi ior tne loresignc anu noer
ality they have shown in provid
ing for and taking care of the
State on a liberal basis but with
out the shadow of reckless ex
penditure.
They have been liberal yet con
servative; they have protected the
interests of the people, yet they
have kept appropriations well in
side the limit of revenues; they
have shown a spirit ot loyalty and
patriotism that will long live in
the hearts of grateful Mississippi-
ans, and take back to their homes
with them the consciousness of
having performed loyally and
faithfully the duties entrusted to
them.
The Legislature just adjourned
will go down in history as one of
the best, most progressive and
most intelligent body of lawmak
ers that ever assembled to trans
act business in the capital of the
State.
They have performed well their
duty and return to their constitu
ents entitled to their thanks, their
confidence and their esteem.
South American newspapers
are now claiming that Champion
Jess Williard is what Mr. Dooley
would call a"Spanyard." They
claim that his true name is Jose
Villar, and that his family came
from Navaira, Spain. It mat

there with the punch.

Good Relations that Are Most
Vital.
The Springfield, Mass.. Re
publican thus closes an ediron:d
on American policy towad Great
Britain: "Finally, our supreme
interest lies in the mrintenance
of good relations wi'.h Canada
and Great Britia0.; nnd while
goods relations are eminently de
sirable with pm-America they
are not so viul to us as friend
ship with the rations of the
Enprlish-sp jakinr world."
Candidl s.f-king, there is
nothing in tli wide, wide world
for the ILir ) States "so vita'
as friendship with the English
speaking world." One, perhap3
the m tin, reason for thi3 is that
British sea mastery is a vital pro
tection of this great nation ;great
in eveo,;-h ng except military
and naval p r.w r. And this must
remain reUtiwy leeble so long

of having "a navy equal to any

by navy authorities.
Such dependence as this upon
the big guns of another nation is
not a thing to be viewed with
prid It offers too close a par
allel to the Carthagenians, wh6 ,
did their fighting by proxy,' and
consequently perish. But the de-' ;
pendence is a fact nevertheless --a
fact there is no use being
sensitive over until "prepared
ness" against German f rightful
ness, which is the real ghost of
the play, is achieved. Depend
ence is, fortunately, linked t:
the other fact that is lodged in
all sane minds. That wa be
tween this country and the Brit

able. This is not so much a case
of love, as that each needs the
other in her business. -Yicks-burg
