CLEAN-UP PROCLAMATION.
By the Mayor.
At the request of the Woman's
Club, that Palatka join in the State
wide Clean-Up Campaign, and that a
week be designated as "Clean-Up
Week," I hereby proclaim the week
beginning April 17th, to the 23rd, as
"Clean-Up Week," and ask the co
operation of every one in making Pa
latka the most attractive city in the
State.
W. P. MERRTAM, Mayor.
Palaka, April 13th, 1916.
The much talked of Elks' Minstrels
filled the New Howell theater to ca
pacity on Monday night, the audience
being composed of Palatka's F. F. P's.
That they enjoyed themselves to the
limit was apparent from the applause
that greeted every number, especial
ly the funny ones.
The scenic arrangements were beau
tiful, the opening one, "The Garden of
Flowers," being especially so. Mayor
Mcrriam acted as purveyor, and in
the assembly were such well-known
local characters as Chas. Anderson,
Qov. Bowen, Mercer ))avis, Frank
Fearnside, Roy Smith, Howard Row
ton, Doc. Slaughter, Crom. Anderson,
Tom Russell, Erby Kersey, Clarence
Holden, Tlios. Shinn, Myers Bailey,
Arnold Probst, Ben. Bear, L. L. Boyh,
R. L. Austin, Carl Davis, H. M. Fearn
side, Gus Raeder, Arthur Corcoran,
Lonnio Caine, H. F. Locks, Henry
Hutchinson, Jr., John Tilghman, Tob.3
Cannon, Charles Smith, Frank Chap
man and Walton Boyle.
During this scene there were vocal
parts entitled "Ain't It Funny," by
Mercer Davis; "Little Gray Mother,"
by R. L. Austin; "Walk, Walk, Walk,"
by Crom. Anderson, and "O'er the
Billowy Sea," by 'Ben Bair, and
"Mother," by L. L. Boyle. It was in
this act also that clever work of the
"end-men" was shown. Of course no
one was expecting anything but clev
er "stunts" from Gov. Bowen, said to
be one of the ablest minstrel perform
ers in the country, but we want to tell
you that our own Charles Anderson
is but little, if any, removed from the
professional class.
There was lots that was funny, and
the laughs followed each act. But
there were some clever things, too,
thnt were too real to be funny, one of
which was the single string musical
performance of Tom Shinn. His mu
sical performance on an old one
string box fiddle was simply marvel
ous. The Elks it is said will clear some
thing like $200.00 from the performance.
Bids Received for Former
The $208, 000 Issue of the Palatka Road
District Sell for 99.07 and Accrued
Interest.
Tjw bonds of the Palatka-East Pa-latka-San-Mateo-Federal
Point special
tax road district, of which an issue
of $208,000 was recently voted by such
an over-whelming majority, were sold
on Wednesday to Cummings, Prudden
& Co., of Toledo, Ohio, -that firm be
ing the highest bidder at $206,068, or
99.07 with acrrued interest. This ac
crued interest means that the county
will not pay the interest from the date
of the issue, March 1st, to about
April 20th, when the Toledo people
will turn over the money and take up
the bonds. This makes the bonds
bring to the district $207,512.
Mr. A. B. Morrison Jr., who repre
sented the successful bidders, was
seen, and seemed quite pleased with
his success in outbidding his many
competitors.
"With one exception," said he,
"these bonds have brought the best
basis price of any district road bonds
yet sold in Florida, and for that rea
son you people have, every reason to
feel proud of the rating placed upon
your district securities. Palatka is a
live place, an all-the-year 'round
town in the midst of a coming great
agricultural section, whose advantages
are being noised abroad in such man
ner rs K, 1 ring a great number of
permanent settlers. Palatka is re
garded as one of the best cities in
Florida."
"District road bonds," continued Mr.
Morrison, " are not as much sought
as county bonds. The county is a rec
ognized governmental division, while
the district is an artificial division
which only continues during the life of
the bonds, unless the indebtedness is
assumed by the county.
"The Bostwick drainage bonds were
not sought because of the compara
tively low assessment on the property
embraced in the district. Their road
bonds were different the road dis
trict has a heavy assessed valuation
in comparison with tho bonds issued."
Mr. Morrison is a typical young
American financier, and a gentleman
of winning personality. He expects
to be in Palatka later, when it is
more than likely his firm will make a
bid on the bonds of the Palatka-Rod-man-Orange
Springs district.
The Bostwick Road district bonds,
issue of $25,000, sold to W. L. Slay
ton, also of Toledo, for $25,180, as
will be seen a little above par.
The only local bank to bid on the
Palatka road district bonds was the
State Bank of Palatka, which made
through its president, F. J. Fernside,
a bid of $204,110. This was a bid
of 98, and while not successful, it is
a fact that the representatives' of for
eign bond buyers here assembled were
watching the local banks, thinking
that they would secure the issues.
This bank assisted in at least giving
that impression and thereby assisted
to boost the price.
The Putnam National and the East
Florida Savings & Trust Co., while
not bidders, were figuring with the
real bidders and also were interested
in the sale.
The following is the list of bidders

Practical Economy
Baking powders made from alum or
phosphate may be bought for a trifle less
than Royal Baking Powder, which is made
from cream of tartar, derived from grapes.
Alum powders are not only cheap, but
they differ greatly in leavening power.
If a cheap baking powder is used for a
fine cake and the cake turns out a failure
there is a waste of costly materials worth
more than a whole can of the cheap bak
ing powder.
Royal Baking Powder produces the
finest food, and its use therefore, results in
an actual saving.

EX-
TALKS PROHIBITION
In Behalf ot the Nation
W de Campaign Now
Being Waged.
Ex-Governor Malcolm R. Patterson
of Tennessee, also at one time a mem
ber of congress from that State, de
livered an eloquent and forceful ad
dress on National Prohibition before
a great crowd at the Putnam county
ourt 5iM.se on Wednesday eveni"?.
The distinguished speaker was intro
duced to the audience by Hon. W. P.
Merriam, mayor of Palatka, in a few
appropriate remarks, and as he step
ped to the front was greeted with
hearty applause.
Gov. Patterson was not always a
prohibitionist; on the contrary as
Governor of Tennessee and some time
after his retirement he was a stren
uous opponent to prohibition, though
even then he was given credit for be
ing an honest opponent. Since his
conversion he has been even more ac
tive in his advocacy of the utter out
lawry of the liquor traffic. "And,"
said the ex-Governor, "I am finding
a heap more satisfaction in this
fight for liquor extermination than 1
ever had in its defense."
Gov. Patterson's address was listen
ed to with the closest attention by he
large audience, and could not be other
than deeply gratified by his reception
in Palatka.
The Wright Case on Trial.
The case of the State of Florida vs.
T .J. Wright of San Mateo, charged

ther and son, at San Mateo last sum
mer, nnd for which a change of venue
was granted by the Circuit Judge at
St. Augustine, will go on trial today
at Green Cove Springs. Hon. S. J.
Hilburn will defend Wright, and th?
State will bo represented by some of
the ablest prosecutors in tho State. A
large number of witnesses will attend
the trial from this county.
STATE ELKS
T
H.
F. Leeks was Elected
Secretary of State
Convention.
Palatkans generally will appreciate
the honor bestowed on their fellow
townsman, Herman F. Leeks, by the
State Convention of the B. P. O. Elks,
which has just closed at Jacksonville.
Mr. Leeks is a typical Elk; fat,
round, jolly and benevolent. He is
one of Palatka's most progressive and
honored citizens, as witness his recent
unanimous election as president of
the board of trade. In thus honor
ing Mr. Leeks, the order has honored
itself and incidentally pleased the peo
ple of this city.
Forrest Lake, candidate for Con
gress and a resident of Sanford, was
elected president; Abe Maas of Tam
pa, first vice president; T. W. Haney
of Jacksonville, second vice president;
W. L. Bates of Key West, treasurer;
James Douglas of Jacksonville, chap
lain, and W. W. Rose of Orlando, ser-geant-at-arms.
The executive com
mittee is made up as follows: A. M.
Taylor, St. Augustine; II. E. Snow of
Tampa; and M. F. Hetherington of
Lakeland.
Orlando was selected as the place
for the meeting of the 1917 State
Convention.
School Trustees Elected.
The Palatka special tax school dis
trict held an election for trustees on
Tuesday and to fix the levy for the
ensuing year. There was no contest,
though in one or two wards of the
city an effort was made and was suc
cessful in defeating the men who
sought the places. The trustees elec
ted are: S. S. Browning, 127; E. M
Earnest 114; J. H. Haughton 109.
The levy was fixed at three mills.
Six other districts in the county
held elections for the same purpose
that day, viz: Welaka. Cr?eent City,
San Mateo, Pomona, Peniel and Flo
rahome. One or two conflicting re
ports have reached us concerning the
outcome of one or two of these dis
trict elections, so that The News will
await the final count of the vote next
Tuesday, when they will be published.
Strawberry Meeting Postponed.
G. N. Hall of Bannerville, who has
been prominent in arranging for the
meoting ot farmers at warcr.n to dis
cuss the feasibility of planting a
large acreage to strawberries in that
section, was in the city this week,
and stated that he had recently re
ceived word from Mr. Waldrup, the
agricultural field agent of the G. S.
& F. R'y, asking that the Bardin
meeting be postponed from the 3d of
May to the 10th. Mr. Hall explained
that Mr. Waldrup could bring a num
ber of others familiar with strawber
ry culture on the latter date who
could not arrange to come on the 3d.
Mr. Hall also suggested that the
day be made a regular basket picnic
occasion, a time when the farmers
could get together and discuss the
subject of strawberry acreage, enjoy
a visit, and that possible a number
of the county candidates would be
present to help make the occasion interesting.
satisfaction at the prices offered and
paid for the bonds. It means that
the work of road building will begin at
a very early day, and that they will
be nearine completion in time for tho
winter traffic
School Entertainment.
The entertainment which the prima
ry grades had prepared for last Fri
day afternoon on the court house
lawn and which had to be postponed
on account- of inclement weather,
much to the disappointment of the
children and the public, will be given
this afternoon a t4:30 o'clock, and it
is hoped the public will not miss this
opportunity of seeing this charming
entertainment and contributing gen
erously toward the fund which is be-
i ing raised for the purchase of a piano
for use in the primary grades.
G. Johnson Tucker Announces.
G. Johnson Tucker, one of the best
and most highly regarded citizens of
Georgetown, has sent us his announce
ment this week as a candidate for
county commissioner from the First
District. The same appears in this
paper.
Mr. Johnson is an old citizen of the
district he seeks to represent and is
connected with some of the best fam
lies. He is a man who has the un
doubted respect of his neighbors and
the people of the entire peninsula, and
his entrance means that the race be
tween himself and Mr. Alvers will be
a lively one.
The section where Mr. Tucker re
sides has long wanted to have a rep
the countv board who
lives in that neighborhood, and efforts
have been made within tne past two or
three weeks to bring out other men
t. but without avail
until Mr. Tucker finally consented.
