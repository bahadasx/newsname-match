Why Leave a Good Thing?
Edward B. Clark says the American farmer is
taking to scientific methods avidly and that within
a decade the farm population problem will have
solved itself. Values are growing constantly.
Children are showing remarkable interest in raising
superior vegetables, fruits, dairy products and live
stock. Federal and State action helps the cause.
I
IN Washington, D. C., the answer
to a certain question is made by
asking another question. To the
query, "Why should the farmers
and the boys stay on the farm?" the
answer comes, "Why should they want
to leave a good thing?"
There is war in Europe, and there
fore it may be held by the entirely
thoughtless that the farming prosper
ity in the United States to which at
tention has just been called by the
department of agriculture's statisti
cians, is merely a thing of the year,
and that a slump will come, and that
as a consequence there will be sim
ply one bright spot to offset several
black spots. There is a good deal of
nonsense in this view of the case.
It is not always wise to take what
may be called a boom year and to use
it either as a basis of comparison or
as a towering landmark to which some
hole in the ground of the past is to be
compared, with the dismal prophecy
that other holes in the ground are
sure to be dug by fortune in the fu
ture. This sort of thing tends to die
courage the men who believe that hill
tops are to remain the general fea
tures of picture landscapes.
Values Grow Constantly.
The year just past has been a great
one. The aggregate production of all
crops is estimated to be seven per
cent larger than the preceding year.
The American farmer has profited, but
it should not be understood that be
cause attention is called to a particu
larly marked growth that development
and increasing prosperity are only
matters of a twelvemonth that is
past.
Let us see what has happened in
the country in the last few years.
Complete government statistics, be
cause the census is taken only once
in ten years, are not available for the
last two or three years, but the word
is that the progress of the preceding
decade has been maintained. Here
are some figures which mean some
thing:
In the year 1900 the value of farm
property in the United States, in
cluding land, machinery, houses and
all other things pertaining to agricultu
ral production was $20,439,901,164. In
ten years these values had more than
doubled, reaching in 1910 the astonish
ing figures of $40,991,449,090.
Farmers Better Off.
Now it might be held by some per
sons that these figres simply would
mean that the farm had multiplied
tremendously and that the increased
valuation would be spread over an
enormous territory occupied by new
farms and that therefore the Individ
ual farmer was in no wise better off.
Well, let us see about this.
In the year 1900 there were in the
United States 5,737,372 farms. In the
year 1910 there were 6,361,502 farms.
A glance at the figures will show that
while the farm property values more
than doubled, the increase in the num
ber of farms, comparatively speaking
of course, were small To have kept
things down at the old basis of values,
the number of farms should have
doubled, while the values were
doubling.
In the year 1900 the average value
of all property per farm was ~3,563.
In 1910 the average value of all prop
erty per farm was $6,444. These fig
ures perhaps almost better than any
thing else can show the advance of
prosperity In the agricultural regions
of the United States.
Other figures, however, are avail
able. In the year 1900 the average
value of farm land per acre was
$15.57. In the year 1900 the average
value of land per acre was $32.40,
more than a doubling up in land
wealth. •
An 83 Per Cent Increase.
The cenrus bureau of the United
states furnishes other figures which
have to do with crop values. In the
year 1899 the value of all crops in the
United States was $2,998,704,412. In
the year 1909, that is Just a decade
later, the value of the crop was $5,
487,161,223, an increase of 83 per cent
in ten years.
For the same ten years we find an
increase of another kind. In 1899
the average value of crops per farm
was a trifle more than $500, while in
1909 It reached the value of $863.
A curious thing is noted in Wash
ington concerning the thoughtlessness
of some men in gauging the proceeds
of industry on the individual farm, or
if you will, on farms in the aggregate.
Some men who think of farming ig
nore utterly the actual land value to
the man who owns his farim. They
say "So and So made so much last
year, but the sum is not big." To the
amount made must be added about five
per cent on the value of the land. A
city man who owns his own house
deducts the rent that otherwise he
would have to pay from his yearly
pnsea, and so, of course, it must
be with the man in the countrr.
Mortgages Are DIsappearing.
The farmer who owns land to the
value of $10.000 must add $500 a year
to his farming prodta. If he did not
own the land he would have to pay
that amount at least for its use. Into
this, of course, must be figuared the
selling value of the property. It land
is valuable it also is valuable when
it is turned into cash. It Leems ridicu
lous, but these things frequently are
overlooked by the average layman
when he is inquiring into prosperity
conditions on the farm.
Statistics show that mortgages are
disappearing from the farming com
munities, that outyard evidences of
prosperity are appearing as mortgages
disappear, as the land becomes more
productive, as the result of the ener
gies of the state and federal depart
m ants of agriculture become more
manifest, and as the farmer applies
more modern methods to his work.
The children at college, the automo
biles which are displacing the buggies
of the olden time, the improving, slow
ly improving as yet, it is true, condi
tions in the rural schools, the marked
improvement and extension of the
country roads and a dozen of other
things show not only increasing pros
perity in the country, but the means
of increased comfort and happiness.
Many Farm Opportunities.
The opportunities on the farm are
growing daily in number and attrac
tiveness. Already there have been
for a year or two evidences that the
leave-the-farm movement has been
checked, and there are further evi
dences that later it will be stopped and
that the return movement will set
in. There is a reason for the objec
tion of Agricultural department offi
cials to the cry of "Back to the Farm."
They have made it "Stay on the
Farm." They know that if the young
men stay by the land that with things
as they are, they will be everlasting
ly glad of it within a few years, and
that as farm life grows more attrao
tive and prosperous the back-to-the
farm movement will take care of it
self, for men go where lies the lure of
comfort and prosperity.
Under the Smith-Lever act the
United States government aids the
states in co-operative demonstration
work on the farms. The total amount
set aside for this work for the years
1915-f6 is $4,782,000;of which $1,080,
000 is from federal ~5ah-Lever funds,
$925,000 from appropriations to the
United States department of agricul
ture for farmers' co-operative demon
stration work, and $110,000 from other
bureaus in the department. These
amounts make the total from federal
sources of $2,115,000.
State and Federal Aid.
Of the funds contributed from
sources within the states $600,000 is
from state Smith-Lever funds made
up mainly of direct appropriations of
the state legislatures. In addition to
funds used under the Smith-Lever act,
$628,000 is appropriated by the state
legislature for extension work, $225,
000 by colleges from funds under their
immediate control, $921,000 by county
authorities and $292,000 from mis
cellaneous sourops.
It is said in Washington by the offi
cials that the interest in the co-opera
tive agricultural extension work is
nothing short of remarkable. At the
outset there was some little objec
tion to the appearance of instructors
in the field. The thought in a few
cases by individual farmers was that
it was presumptuous for the scientific
fellows to come along and attempt to
teach them their work. This feel
ing never was widespread, and it has
virtually disappeared.
Children Much Interested.
The boys and girls of the country
have shown an admiration and I won
derful interest in the instructive work
of the agents of the departments. The
canning clubs, the corn clubs and
other clubs which have been estab
lished have added to the prosperous
conditions of the farm, but as yet
there is only a beginning. The promise
is great for the future. The interest
that has been aroused in the young
and the increasing assurance of sue
cess makes the boys and girls desirous
of staying where they see success is
certain.
In the agricultural colleges there
sult of federal and state action in the
work of increasing prosperity on the
farms of the country is manifest.
Young men and young women are tak
ing courses, the men as instructors in
the actual farm work and the women
as instructors in household economics.
Prosperity is increasing on the farms
in the United States. Under recently
quickened government aid and gen
eral interest in the subject, and un
der the improved conditiotns of coun
try life, it seems certain that the pace
of prosperity is to be greatly accel
erated. Stay on the farm.
For Efficient Farming
Eficilency is as necessary on the
farm as in the factory, the shop or
the store. To be emcient in farming
involves a certain amomt of pre
paredness just as to be efcient in
war involves caretful and scientifc
preparation. It behooves every young
man who expects to secure his living
from the soil to prepare himself for
his life work just as thoroughly as his
circumstances will permit. He may
do this by studying at home and by
observing the methods of successaful
farmers
