WILLIAM HAMILTON HAS
ANSWERED LAST .CALL.
As we are closing the forms on
this issue of Tho Record, we learn of
tho death of William Hamilton in
this city. Consumption is tho cause
of his demise, nnd ho has been grad
ually sinking for some months past.
It was thought on several occasions
earlier in tho week that his last mo
ments had come, but then he would
rally and feel a little better for a
time.
Mr. Hamilton came here with his
brother Robert (his only surviving
near kinsman, if he is still alive) n
few years ago, nnd remained here with
cousins and other distant relatives,
while his brother returned to the old
country. William was receiving an
annuity from his father's estate suf
ficient to keep him comfortably, but
for the last year and a half he has
received no tidings from his brother,
nor remittance from his estate. Ho
fcai'cd that his brother had enlisted in
the army and hnd possibly been 'num
bered with the slain.
Tho Hamiltons are distantly related
to the Bullochs of this city, and Wil
liam was at the homo of David C.
Bulloch when the end came.
Deceased was of a quiet, retiring
disposition, genctous to a fault, and
was thought a great deal of by his
intimate acquaintances.
Wo are not yet advised as to the
arrangement for funeral services.
DIXIE ACADEMY OPERA
IS COMING NOV SURE
Tlie Record is requested to announce
that the Dixie Academy is now surely
coming to Cedar City with their opera
entitled Robin Hood, which was ad
vertised to come a few weeks back,
but for some reason wns not able at
that time to fill the appointment.
The paits previously snng by Miss
Lillic Shipp and Mr. McAllister, who
have returned to Snlt Lake, are ably
represented by Miss Crosby and Dr.
Donald McGregor, who, we arc as
suieu, arc making a complete success
of the roles, and in some respects
surpassing the original cast for these
parts.
The piece w'ill include not less thnn
fifty or &ixty voic.es, and will no doubt
be a great treat.
Tho appearance here is to be made
Thursdny'night, April 20th, at the B.
A. C. auditorium, and it is hoped that
there will be a good crowd out tn wit
ness the effort of our Dixie friends
and neighbors.
PLAYING .IN HARD LUCK
AGAIN THIS WEEK.
Tho Record has been playing in
hard luck again this week. Busy on
other matters during the early part
of the week the composition of tho
newspaper was left for the last two
days, which under ordinary circum
stances allows sufficient time; but at
the crucial moment something went
wrong with tho dynamo of the elec
tric, plant yesterday afternoon, and
there has been no power or electric
lights since. After waiting for tho
power as long asiwe possibly dared,
we have had to have recourse to the
old gasoline engine, which proves a
very unsatisfactory substitute for the
electric power, and the result is that
the issue is not only late, but rather
inferior as well. We have fought it
out however the best we could under
the circumstances, and beg the in
dulgence of our renders if n number
of important matters have beon omit
ed and tho paper assays below par.

ORIGIN AND HAUNTS
OF THE FLY FAMILY
Pertinent Questions and Truthful An
swers Concerning This Vitnl
Enemy of Hutnnnlty.
1. Where is tho house fly born?
In filth, chiefly in horse manure nnd
outhouses.
2. How long is the life cycle of his
birth? About ten days from the time
the egg is laid until tho mature fiy is

5. Is there anything too filthy for a
fly to cat? No.
0. Does the fly like clean food, too?
Yes, nnd it appears to be his delight
to wipe his feet on clean food.
7. Where is his favorite place of
feeding? The mnnure heap, tho gar
bage can, tho privy vault, and the
spittoon.
8. Where does the fly go after leav
ing the manure pile, the garbage can,
the privy vault and the spittoon?
Into the kitchen, dining room and bed
room. 9. What docs he do in the kitchen,
dining room nnd bedroom? He wipes
his feet on the food, bathes in the
milk, and annoys tho sleeper.
10. Does the fly visit thowj sick
with typhoid fever, consumption,
smallpox and cholera infantum? He
certainly docs, and may call on you
next.
11. Is the fly dangerous? Yes, ho

TnmplalntrWhertfthBrG.aro'thc-most1
flics.
10. Where arc the most flics?
Where there is most filth.
17. Is the presence of flies there
fore an indication of nearby filth?
IJ most certainly is, nnd that is dis
graceful. 18. How may we successfully fight
the fly? By destroying or removing
his breeding place, the manure pile,
removing all garbage and making
pri'-y vault fly-proof, and by keeping
our yard and alley clean; by screening
the house; by the use of the wire
swatter and sticky fly-paper; by trap

As the time draws nenr to tho end
of the new printing press campaign,
many of our subscribers are respond
ing to our invitation to assist with the
enterprise, and are sending in their
subscription renewals, for which we
wish to thank them very sincerely.
But ,a great many more will have to
follow suit if we realize our ambition
in this particular. Possibly YOU have
not contributed your dollar and a half
to the cause yet.
Yes, sir-ee, we aro going to have
that new printing press! You can bet
your bottom dollar on that. Whethor
or not you will be numbered among
thoso loyal citizens who did their part
towards the undertaking will of course
depend solely upon yourself. Wo cer
tainly hope to havo the pleasure of
entoring your name with the rest.
But whether you are one of them or
not, thero are enough patriotic citi

dertaking through.
