FARMERS FAVOR
GOOD roads; TO
APPROVE BONDS
Monday wai a busy day for the merchant, and while not to
many people were in town those who came evidently came to buy
In fact, about all they did was to purchase goods and discuss the
road bond issue. Farmers from every section of the county de
clared for the bonds, while very few expressed themselves as
against the proposition.
' According to those on the
streets and in the stores Monday,
the people are looking with favor
upon the plan by which good
roads may be built throughout
the county before another winter
arrives.
Sentiment in favor of the bond
issue has been found in places
where it has been expected the
opposition would be the strong
est. As the voters begin to
understand the proposition
thoroughly they are coming out
squarely for it.
Friends of good roads are jubi
lant following interviews with
people coming to Paris almost
daily and express themselves as
confident that if a little work is
done in organizing friends of the
bond issue that there can be no
doubt but what it will carry.
Rain has prevented the farm
ers from working several days
this week, but the good weather
that prevailed Tuesday, Wednes
day and Thursday, has improved
conditions considerably, and
within the next few days, if the
weather permits, they will get
to work in earnest.
The amount of purchases made
here Monday was surprising,
merchants state, considering the
number"Dipeople in town. Some
of the merchants declare that it
was the busiest day of the year.
