DRESS-UP WEEK
CLOVIS
Local Merchants Prepare to Satisfy Sartorial Long
ings for Each and Every Citizen of Clovis. Get
Togged Out for Easter. Country Wide Move
ment Has at Last Found Place in Clovis.
Clovis has at last succumbed
to the inevitable. The move
ment that ha been gaining in
favor all over the country for a
Dresa-Up week has struck Clovis
and the enterprising merchants
have been (retting together and
arranging a satisfactory date for
the men and women of this city
to observe a day of sartorial
revelry. This city has long been
famous for the "dressy" ap
pearance of its citizens. Evi
dence this, that prosperity is
extensive throughout this sec
tion. Practically all of the mer
chants are satisfied with the
ime designated which is ufter
pay flay ami ju?t before Easter.
Ample ev. donee that every mer
chant in twr. is prrpared for
'.he occasion is proven by the
large and well selected stocks of
new spring vid summer goods

ladies and nun's wearing ap
i.arel and millinery. Never be
for in the history of Clovis has
there teen B'K-h large and
well
vhoson stocks of new goods. It
is true that Clothes do not make
the man, but appearance goes
long wavr, these days and the
wearer t- eii a whole lot better
when outfitted from head to foot
and w hen he realizes that he is
just as well dressed as the other
fellow that he might come in
contact with. The ayerage man
altio takes pride in seeing his
wife, mother or sister well dress
fid and this likewise has a ten
dency to make him feel more
contented if his own apparel is
well chosen.
Extravagant clothing is not
necessary to be well dressed
We believe that every man and
woman should dress within their
means, but they can present just
as good an appearance if their
clothes are well selected as one
who has Jths most costly rai

uvery uno ui uovis, who is

a new outfit from head to foot
this Easter arid help present
that pioaper ous look for which
Clovis is famous.
borne or our Citizens mav not
feel justified in spending a large
sum on a new outfit, but this is
not altogether necessary these
days as the art of the hatter,
shoemaker, clothier and haber

point where you can dress well
and at a limited expense.

APRIL 14 TO 22
A. L. Await Reinstated
County Clerk
News came from the Supreme
Court Clerk at Santa Fe Tuesday
to attorneys Patton and Bratton,
consel for A. L. Await in his ap
peal from the action of the dis
trict court in ousting him from
the office of county clerk of
Curry county, that the de.-ision
had been remanded and th e
complaint quashed,
This will doubtless mean that
as soon as court convenes again
May 8. that Mr. Await will he re
instated in his office from which
he was ousted over a yeur ago
and V. C. Zerwer appointed to
fill the unexpired term. It also
means that Mr. Await will be
entitled to full pay for the time
that he has been erroneously de
prived of his office and that
Curry county will be compelled
to pay the salaries of two county
clerks,
The incident of the removal of
.Mr. Await from office on alleged
irregularities, is no doubt ptill
fresh in the minds of the people
and his final vindication by the
highest court in tne 8tle will
be the source of satisfaction to
the defendant and a cause for
rejoicing among his friends.
Mr. Await contended at that
time and still contends that it
was a "frame up" of some of
his political enemies who occupy
official positions in this county
and who instigated the removal
plot because he refused to chose
at their bidding. He has since
discussed the matter freely giv
ing names and facts which he
alleges were the cause of his
temporary political disgrace.
The salary which will be due
him, will amount to something
like $1,500.00.
Horse Thief Caught
Frank Ivy returned from
Amarillo Tuesday with Bill
Davis a youth of twenty-one
years of age, who is charged
with stealing a horse and saddle
belonging to Dave Owen for
whom he was employed here for
several months. Davis rode the
horse to Black, a station this
side of Hereford, where he turn
ed the horse loose and expressed
the saddle to Amarillo. At the
latter place Davis approached an
officer and asked what time the
express would be delivered. The
officer asked him if he was look
ing for something and he said
that he was looking for a saddle
whereupon the officer advised
him that he was also looking for
him. The clue was obtained
from the station agent at Black,
Associated Charities
On account of there being
smallpox in Clovis, we thought
best not to make a house to
house canvas for the second
hand or cast off clothing, but in
stead will ask those who have
such to give for charity to please
phone Miss Mary Knight, phone
number 165 and we will call and
get them immediately.

SANTA FE MAKES
REPLY TO DEMANDS
Railroad Situation Between Roads and
Becomes One of General Interest.
Must Yield. Who Will it Be?
Reply has been made by the
Santa Fe railway through (Gen
eral Manager F. C, Fox to the
demand for an eight-hour day
without reduction in pay, made
formally by the train service
employes last Thursday. Mr.
Fox says:
"Your proposition applies to
the Atchison, Topeka & Santa
Fe Railway company and leased
lines, Panhandle & Santa Fe
Railway company and Rio
Grande, El Paso & Santa Fe
Railroad company.
" 1 he present standard of rates
and working conditions have
been very largelv fixed by medi
ation and arbitration, and the
companies feel that they are
adequate and even liberal to the
employes. These companies
have no desire to change either
existing rates of pay or the
working rules, nor to reduce the
earning possibilities of the em
ployes under their existing rules,
but in asmuch as your proposals
contemplate fundamental
changes in operating methods
and practices on which the sche
dules have been built up, these
companies hereby give notice in
conformity with the schedules
now in effect that in connection
with and as a part of the con
sideration and disposition of
your proposas there shall be
open for consideration and dis
position those provisions in the
schedules or practices there
under governing compensation
in the classes of service affected
by your proposals or those in con
flict with the following principles
as apply to such classes.
(a) No double compensation
for the same time and service.
(b) The same classificstion for
the purpose of compensation to
be applied to all members of a
train and engine crew.
(c) Two or more differently
paid classes of service performed
in the same day or trip to be paid
proportionate rates according to
the class of service with not less
than a minimum day for the
combined service.
"As our present contracts do
not relate to rates, rules and
regulations governing the em
ployment of hostlers, your propo
sition cannot be considered by
these companies as applicable to
that class of service,
"As to joining other railway
companies in the United States
and entering into a collective
movement as requested in the
third paragraph of your letter,
wish to advise that this feature
of your proposition will be taken
under consideration and advice
given later."
Practically every railroad has
made reply to the eight-hour de
mand along the above lines,
which is in effect a virtual re
jection. The railroads ask for
an open door. The executive
committee of the four major rail
road organizations, representing
around 309,000 men will meet in
Chicago April 29 to formulate a
plan for further action as the
replies so far received submitted
counter proposals, nullifying the
employes' demands.
Mrs. Miller, mother of Claude
Miller, is visiting here.

Church Building
Some weeks ago the News
stated that the Methodists were
going to erect a $10,000 church
building. This announcement
was a little premature. They
have met with such success in
their contributions that we are
now informed that they propose
to build a house of worship that
will cost at least $15,000. At
least that is the plan recently
adopted instead of $10,000 plan
and the indications are that they
will succeed in securing that
amount. $4200.00 has been sub
scribed to date and they expect
to get a donation of $2500 from
the church extension board and
10 Lorrow another $2500 from
the same source. The Church
extension board meets on May
6 at which time the amount
which can be obtained will be
dtiinaiely known. The church
plan is 58x70 l'eet? with a dining
room in the basement. It is
planned to finish the upper part
and the dining room first and
the balance at a later date.
School Marms Cannot Dance
No more shall the Clovis school
marms "trip the light fantastic"
to the sweet strains of the dance
music until the wee small hours
of the morning. No more can
they be publicly hugged to the
tune of some rag time music
they may be hugged but not
with music accompaniment.
The school board this week issu
ed a decree that hereafter the
teachers in the Clovis schools
will be prohibited from dancing
during the term of such employ
ment. The reason is said to be
the empairment of teaching ef-i
ficiency by keeping late hours
and the setting of a bad example
to the scholars. Girls seeking
ball room dressss and dancing
slippers may now have an oppor
tunity to buy at a discount by
making application to the proper
parties.

CLOVIS CHAMBER OF
COMMERCE RE-ORGANIZED
Claud Miller Elected President and New Organiza
tion Perfected at Friday Night's Meeting. Pro
gram Announced for Entertainment of Bankers
June 6-7. Election of Secretary Deferred.
Although there was only a
small attendence of members at
the Chamber of Commerce Fri
day night, those who went were
never-the-less enthusiastic about
what the organization might ac
complish for the good of Clovis
and Curry County. While some
few have expressed dissatisfac
tion in the manner in which the
Chamber of Commerce has been
conducted, a careful investiga
tion of whose who found such
complaint will usually justify
the finding that they never did
anything for the organization to
make it any better or for the
bentflt of the town or commun
ity. It is not for the News to
say that the Chamber of Com
merce of Clovis has accomplished
much in tha last few years.
This is too well known for suc
cessful contradiction and these
results, such as silo day, Sudan
tarmers day, county fairs ana
many other such things speak
for themselves.
More can be accomplished for
the upbuilding of a town by a
good live organization such as a
Chamber of Commerce than
through any other agency. It
is the best means of uniting the
brains and energy of the busi
ness men of the community and
to get action that brings results.
The following officers were
elected:
President, Claude Miller
1st Vice President, Bert Curless
2nd V. President, W. B. Cramer
3rd V. President. A. W. Skarda
Treasurer, Alex Shipley.
Directors:
W. I. Luikart. S. A. Jones, A.
VV. Shard a, W. B. Cramer, C. E.
Dennis, Bert Curless and John
Barry.
The election of a secretary was
deferred until a later meeting!
subject to the recommendation
of the president.
A better selection than Claude
Miller for prendent could not
have been made. He is every
inch a booster. He owns ex
tensive interests here and hav-
nK ben in business in Oklahoma
City t for 9r?r8! yaur8 and !
Commerce, which is known
as
the best in the world, he should
be in a position to give some
valuable assistance to the Clovis
organization. Mr. Miller was in
business here when the town
was new and he always took an
active part in ail that stood for
progress. We feel that we can
predict without fear of success
ful contradiction that he will be
able to build up our commercial j
organization known as the
Chamber of Commerce, to be
the greatest institution of its
kind in the state of New Mexico
