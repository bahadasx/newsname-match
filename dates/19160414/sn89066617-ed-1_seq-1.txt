SAFE CRACKERS
ROB LILLY VAULT,
FIND ONLY $1.70
Yeggmen Would Have Got
ten $200 Had They Work
ed Night Before.
SCALED PLANK AND
PRIED OPEN WINDOW
Salve Used by Thieves to Hold
Blast in Warehouse
Till.
The safe-cracker that blew thj safe
in the office of Thomas S. Lilly, the
wholesale flour dealer, got only $1.70,
which, the police say, was not su flit-it
nt to cover the cost of the "soup"
used in opening the vault.
Had the money till boon cracked
twenty-four hours earlier, Mr. Lilly
said yesterday, the yeggs would have
received more than $200 for their
work. "Hut this has been a lesson for
me," said Mr. Lilly. "I will see to it
that all money is deposited in the bank
each evening."
At what time the thief or thieves
entered the warehouse Tuesday night
is not known. The robbery was dis
covered by Edgar Kain, an employe,
when he opened the office yesterday
morning. As Mr. Kain approached
the building, a colored lad notified him
that the south door was open. This
aroused Kain's curiosity, and he im
mediately began an investigation.
He found the door leading to the
office ajar, and as ho entered the
room he noticed the safe open and
papers and checks scattered about th?
floor. The varnish on the safe door
levealed the robbery.
He then communicated with Mr.
Lilly, after which he telephoned to
Chief of Police Hutson. Rudolph Feld
hoff, who was passing on his way to
work, was called into the office to look
at the wreck. Mr. FeldhorT is familiar
with safes and has helped to repair
many that have been cracked by
thieves. He said that nitro-glycerine
had been used.
A .jimmy and a piece of lead-pipe
were left in the office by the safe
blower, but there were no indications
that the pipe had been used. The
police were unable to explain the pur
pose of the lead-pipe.
In effecting an explosion of this
character, thieves usually seal the
crevices in the door by plugging it up
with soap, and after this has been
accomplished, the explosive liquid is
poured into the crack at the top. The
coat of soap forms a cup, which holds
the "soup" and makes it possible for
the thief to get a sufficient quantity
of it in the aperture to force the safe.
Hut instead of using soap in cracking
the Lilly vault, the robbers substituted
horse-salve, which is sold by Mr.
Lilly. The box from which the salve
was taken was covered with a yellow
fluid, which had been left by the
safe-crackers.
The cash drawer had been removed
and taken awayby the thieves. It con
tained onlv $1.70 in cash and pome
naoers. which had no value, Mr. Lilly
stated to The Tribune yesterday.
The warehouse offers an ideal field
for robbers. It stands beside the
C. G. & N. railroad tracks and on the
brow of Happy Hollow, which at that
particular place is filled with under
brush and debris, affording excellent
places for hiding. Because of its iso
lated location, Mr. Lilly has not until
recently kept money in the safe. The
vault has been used for the books of
the firm, but recently Mr. Lilly has
kept money there over night.
Mr. Lilly made an investigation yes
terday to ascertain how the thieves
entered his establishment. The hay
warehouse, which stands above the
ground, resting on stilts, is high
enough for a man to walk beneath it.
A board pried loose from beneath this
building was used to climb up to the
office window on the south side of the
main building.
Mr. Lilly is confident that at least
two men participated in the robbery.
Because of the distance from the
ground to the window, it would be
necessary for one man to have assisted
the other in scaling the board and
prying open the window. The board
used in reaching the window was left
leaning against the building.
Once on the inside, the burglar had
access to the entire building. He un

R. L DEARMONT-
OLIVER WEDDING
Guests Pronounce Affair most
Magnificent Ever Held
In Cape.
FATHER GIVES AWAY
DAUGHTER AS BRIDE
Each Recently Recovered From
Severe Illness to Co to
Housekeeping.
Guests at the wedding last night of
Miss Marguerite Oliver and Russell L.
Dearmont at the home of the bride's
parents, Mr. and Mrs. II. 15. Oliver,
740 North street, pronounced the
affair the most magnificent ever held
in the Cape.
All the art of the expert decorator
had been plied in the preparation of
the Oliver home for the wedding. The
wedding itself marked the culmination
of a brilliant series of social enter
tainments for the couple given in the
last two weeks by their friends and
relatives, chief among these functions
being a dance at the Elks Club, an
entertainment by Mrs. S. B. Hunter
and a dinner by Mr. and Mrs. V.
Palmer Oliver.
Invitations had been extended by the
Oliver family to about 100 of the
couple's relatives and intimate friends.
Elaborate arrangements for the recep-
tion of the wedding guests hr.d been
made.
The ceremony was performed in the
living room at the Oliv-r home by
Rev. J. F. Lawson of the Presbyterian
church. Senator Oliver gave his
daughter away. Miss Oliver was at
tended by Miss Mary Kochtitzky as
maid of honor, and Miss Hazel Harri
son and Kathryn Himmelberger were
bridesmaids.
Mr. Dearmont was accompanied by
Julian Dearmont, his brother, as best
man, and Evrd Oliver and Nelson
Dearmont.
White roses and smilax decorated
the living room where the ceremony
was performed, and other parts of the
house were decorated with roses, smi
lax and sweet peas. In the reception
hall and dining room, pink Kilhirney
roses were features.
The bride wore a' string of pearls
which her mother received from Sen
ator Oliver on their marriage '',( years
ago, and she carried a bouquet of
orange blossoms. The maid of honor
and bridesmaids carried bouquets of
pink Killarney roses and were gowned
alike in pink and white.
The bride's table was placed in the
parlor, which was decorated similarly
to the reception hall and dining room.
Many of the wedding guests were
from out of town. When the bridal
cake was cut each of the guests
received a portion done up in a carton
bearing the D and O significant of the
wedding.
The couple received many gifts of
a magnificent description from tho
guests. Many things which they will
be able to use when they commence
housekeeping were numbered in the
list of gifts. One of the most elab
orate was a combination gift of a
chest of silverware made up of several
gifts from many of the individual
guests. Every piece essential in set
ting-a banquet table of the most ex-
traordinarv character was included in
the chest. !
That Miss Oliver and Mr. Dearmont
both had but recently recovered from
severe illness, became, known last
night after the wedding. Mr. Dear
mont for several days last week had a
severe attack of tonsilitis, and Miss
Oliver was suffering with a bad cold
and a slight attack of grip. Both re
covered completely before the date set
for the wedding.
On their departure from the Cape
last night for a two-weeks honeymoon
trip, the couple maintained their des
tination a secret. They will go to
housekeeping on their return in an
apartment on Pacific street, which has
been furnished in the last few weeks.
The engagement of Mr. Dearmont,
who is a graduate of the Normal and
the University of Missouri and a
member of the Phi Delta Theta Fra
ternity, to Miss Oliver was announced
last January 1 at a dinner given at
the Oliver home.
Miss Oliver has studied at several
schools and when the war broke out
in Europe she was touring the Euro

CAPE MAY HAVE 2
7-FOOT HOWITZERS
Or 37-inch Size, Russell Says in
Reply to Mayor Kage's
Ultimatum.
Two howitzers, each seven f. et l. rg,
known as twelve-pounders, or a pair
of smaller brass or bron: cannon. ;
each .'17 inches in length, will bo J
delivered to the Cane to be- mounted '
in the Courthouse park as soon
city makes a selection. This is the j
result of the ultimatum Mavor Kag"
1 . j
sent to Congressman Jospn J. uusseil :
last Sunday.
Each of the
seven-foot howitzers
weighs 1200 iiounds. and if the city
Qevts to hav0 thorn installed, at the
brow of the terrace in front o! the
courthouse, they will have to be
shipped from New York. Th" smaller
cannon are located at Bock Island. 111.,
and weigh about 2o0 pounds each.
The choice that rests with the city
was offered to the Mayor yesterday in
a letter he received from Congressman
'
Russell. The ultimatum that
Mayor sent to the Congressman was
provoked by advices he received that
Congressman Walter L. Hcnsley of
Karmington had obtained a pair of
cannon for Farmington's courthouse
park. The Cape had a pair of cannon
about two years ago, but they were
recalled by the War Department.
The letter from Congressman Bus-
sell follows:
"Hon. F. A. Kage: Your letter re
ceived and contents noted. I have for
onetime been conferring with the
authorities here about the cannon to
which you are entitled by reason of
the law that I got passed about a year
ago. I find that I can get the two
provided for, brass or bronze cannon,
the same as Hensley secured for
Farmington, at Rock I.-land, if they
will be acceptable to your people.
They are small in size, but very
pretty and n"at. They weigh about
C20 pounds each and are 07 inches
long. If these will be acceptable, and
you will write me a letter as Mayor,
stating that they will, and the City
will pay the freight upon them from
Rock Island to Capa Girardeau, I will
have them forwarded at once.
"If you prefer larger cannon, I can
secure two brass or bronze twelve
pounders, that are about seven feet
long and weigh about 1200 pounds
each, but they would have to be

A. L. HANNAH, 24
Was Repairing High Line on
Drag-line near Whitewater
When Electrocuted.
COMPANION CONFUSED
WHISTLE BLAST SIGNAL
Body Falls From Pole 2. Feet to
Ground -Taken to
Whitewater.
The wrong signal yesterday after
noon caused tiie instant death l
electrocution of A. L. Hannah, an
electrical engineer, who w;.s working
on th power feed line running from
the Cape to a drag-!in. machine near
Whitewater.
A charge of i:20O volts of elec
tricity pas.-ed through Hannah's body
and he fell from the cross-arms of the
jo!e on which lie was working, 2-" i'e.-t
to the jrcund. V.'h'-n his companions
reached h:m. he was dead.
Hannah was the elettrica! engineer
in charge of al! the electrical work en
tyc
drag-line machine, winch was
ope.-ated by th"" Fioesch Construction
Company on a segment of the main
diversion channel of the Lit lie River
Drainage District. Hannah was 24
years old.
The electrocution occurred about 6
o'clock and the news of the death did
not riach the Cane until o'c'ock
last night, when Robert G. Nunn was
notified to make arrangements for a
casket in the Cape.
The body had (een taken to White
water by Hannah's companions. The
place whore the men were working is
a couple of miles out of Whitewater
in the midst of a swamp ami wooovd
lowland.
The drag-line machine has been
woiking from Rock Levee toward
Whitewater, and power for its opera
ti n has been furnished by a high
tension feed cabie running from th."
power house in the Cape to White
water. The t able is about the size of
a troll-y w ire and is known as the
"high line."
The line follows the course of the
proposed thannel of the ditch and as
tiie machine moves forward bit by b.t.
the connection from t!i" machine to
the cable is also advanced by the elec
trician in charge of the machine.
In breaking the old connection and
carrying the wire from tiie drag-line
machine forward to the new position,
where it is again hitched to th" high
iin", it is essential that no power b -in
the cable. No man can touch the
hit.li line and live, the charge of lec
tricity is so great.
Consequently, breaks in the wire
have been arranged at intervals of
about a mil? where there are cut-off
switches. By pulling out this switch
the current from the segment of the
line extending on toward Whitewater
is cut ov.t and workmen then can
handle the wire. It is necessary t
make such cut-offs also when the wire
liecoiv.es broken. In clearing the land
ahead of the ditch, stumps often have
to hi dynamited out and in some of
the explosions the stumps have been
thrown high into the air, the debris
falling across the cabie and breaking
it in two.
A man is sent back to the nearest
cut-off switch, where he pulls out the
switch to check the power. He re
mains at the switch on guard until the
work has been completed at the ma
chine or other places. When the re
pairs have been made and the wire is
ready for service again, the guard at
the cut-off switch is signalled to
throw on the power by a blast of the
engine whistle on the drag-line ma
chine. He then is instructed to put
the power back on th high line and
come forward to the machine.
The location where Hanhah was
killed is on a curve in the channel.
