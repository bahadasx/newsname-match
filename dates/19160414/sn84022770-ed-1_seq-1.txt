SMITH REPLIES TO
ARTICLE BY LEWIS
•LOCAL FARMER TAKES EXCEP
TION TO CRITICISM BY STATE
COLLEGE GRADUATE.
Editor Washington Standard:
In your issue of March 31 I no
ticed an article written by Lee C.
Lewis, son of Pred W. Lewis of
Brighton Park, and graduate of the
agricultural department of the
Washington State College, at pres
ent engaged as tester for a cow
testing association in the Walla
Walla district.
He introduces his remarks by
modestly saying that he is against
newspaper controversies, but thinks
my article in your issue of March 3
was very sarcastic, and some of the
impressions 1 may have conveyed
should be corrected, and then the
aforesaid young man proceeds at
once to storm the fort with insinuat
ing personalities (a form of discus
sion which I abhor.) He would carry
the impression that t am a ne'erdo
well, that I do not apply business
principles in my farming, and that I
am very mtach disgruntled with
present conditions.
Now, had he given my article a
second reading, I think he would
have discovered that I had no
grouch with the or the
markets, but was simply after the
fellow who was whimpering about
these things. And as to my business
principles in farming, or my success
in life, I make no boast, but M to my
little farm, farm buildings, pumping
plant and irrigation system, I think
they will compare favorably with my
neighbors, and they are paid for and
that, too, with honest toll.
Rap* State College.
As for this young man, Lee C.
Lewis, I would say that.he is a bright
young fellow, who took advantage of
the state agricultural school and, I
have no doubt, graduated with high
honors. Bat, I notice that he is not
farming, no, not to mention. He,
like so many others who graduate
from these institutions, find it more
congenial and far more remunera
tive to follow other vocations. Farm
er C. L. Smith, in his article on "Evo
lution of Agricultural Education,"
says that the so-called colleges of
agriculture in former years turned
out teachers, preachers, merchants,
bankers and odd job men, but very
few farmers, and I wish to add that
the statement holds good in a very
large degree today.
No, Mr. Lewis is not a farmer. v He
is but a boy, chuck full of theories,
but some of us older ones have long
since learned that there is a decided
difference between the theoretical
and the practical as applied in the
hard battle of life. And before dis
pensing too much information he
might do well to "tarry at Jericho
till his heard is grown."
He ventures the belief that money
can be made in dairying in Thurston
county, but this is simply his opinion,
without any experience whatever to
support his convictions. Now, allow
me to present the testimony of one of
mature years and wide experience in
the dairy business of Thurston coun
ty, Mr. L. L. Snow, master of Pomona
Orange, who, in conversation with
me but a few days "since, made this
statement:
"There is nothing in cows. I have
sold my stock and will give my at
tention to chickens." And, I might
add right here, that Mr. Snow had
recently put in silos and given the
matter his best and honest effort.
This dairy was kept for the sale of
butterfat, and not whole milk, skim
milk, or town pump.
Notice, If you please, the profit on
high grade cows that Mr. Lewis was
testing: $2.03 per month, and that,
too, on his own quotations of hay
$9 and grain $6 per ton lower than
the price which obtained in Thurston
county for that time. In my previous
article I simply cautioned the farmer
to go slow and produce his own feed,
nnd this was also the advice given by
Parmer Smith when lecturing in
Olympia.
But of course we always here this
from the booster: "Be careful now,
you might frighten away some pros
pective settler." Away with this de
ception—we are tired of it. Give the
people the truth; tell them of our

Detail*) of Cow-Tenting Association
to Be Completed and Teeter Hired.
Members of the cow-testing asso
ciation now being formed here are
requested to attend a meeting at the
Chamber of Commerce at 1 o'clock
Saturday afternoon, April 22, when
final details of the organization will
be worked out and a tester employed,
according to an announcement made
this week by L. R. Campbell, presi
dent of the Thurston County Dairy
men's association.
Some 47 cows are yet to be ob
tained to complete the number re
quired for an association and Mr.
Campbell anticipates no trouble in
enlisting them. O. E. Gibson of the
federal department of agriculture,
who was to have spent a couple of
days here this week completing the
enrollment, was in the city on other
matters but was unable to devote any
time to the work. He is expected to
return in a few days, however, so that
the membership roll will be complete
when the first meeting of the asso

DAGGEn DENIES HE .
INTENDS TO RESIGN
THE RUMOR GAINED CURRENCY
AFTER BUREAU REPORT ON
HIS EXPENSE ACCOUNT.
Persistent reports that Chairman
Floyd L. Daggett of the industrial
insurance commission intended to
resign as the result of the report
made by the bureau of inspection
after an investigtion of his expense
account, were denied by him this
weak, while Governor Lister also
told Seattle reporters he had not
consulted Mr. Daggett and knew
nothing about it.
Chairman Daggett has been in Ta
coma this week, attending the trial
of Arthur (Monk) Young, charged
with complicity in the industrial in
surance looting. The report of the
bureau of inspection was made last
| Friday and covered a comparison of
the vouchers sworn to by Chairman
Daggett and the books of Seattle, Ta
coma and Spokane hotels, question
ing some S2OO worth of expenses Mr.
Daggett had charged to the state.
The investigation was made at the
request of Governor Lister follow
ing the publication in a Seattle
weekly of charges that Mr. Daggett
had padded his expense account.
When the report was submitted to
the attorney general by the bureau,
Mr. Daggett also wrote the attorney
general, stating in his letter: "I
would be pleased to go over it with
you and make such explanations as I
may have. I also wish to state that
If there are charges therein that In
your Judgment should not have been
made, I am ready to make such re
i fund as in your Judgment is proper."
Various items Included in his ex
pense account by Mr. Daggett, such
as laundry, tailoring work and the
like, were also questioned by the
bureau In Its report. Greatest stress
is laid on the fact, howfever, that the
vouchers as filed with the state
auditor, which appear to have been
regularly made, fully itemised and
properly signed, call for larger
amounts than the hotel ledgers. Mr.
Daggett's explanation is that in his
hotel bills he inrfuded various inci
dental items of expense incurred out
side the hotels.
Governor Lister is going over the
bureau's report carefully and ex
pects to have a conference with Mr.
Daggett before taking any action on
it. The attorney general has not
acted on it.
Revival services have been in
progress this week at the First Meth

the local Ministerial Alliance, with
Rev. T. H. Atchinson as the evange

COURT COMPELS CITY TO
BUY WATER PUNT MOTOR
Local Power Company Buys Trans
former—Must Also Pay
Water BUI.
When Superior Judge D. F. Wright
Wednesday directed the city to pay
the Westinghouse Electric company
$350 for the electric motor at the
waterworks pumpign station, and the
Olympla Light ft Power company
bought the transformers, the contro
versy in which the city has been en
gaged with the company for several
weeks and which came to a show
down Tuesday night, was tempora
rily ended.
The city, however, has a manda
mus suit still pending in the local
court, by which it seeks to compel
the old water company to pay for the
motor. It originally cost SSOO but
the city was allowed $l5O credit for
payment made by the old company.
The situation became acute Tues
day when attorneys for the Westing
house company obtained a writ of
replevin and, with Sheriff McCorkle,
went over to the plant to seise the
motor and transformers. From early
that afternoon until about 10 o'clock
that night the waterworks pumps
were shut off, but the company and
city water company finally reached
an agreement whereby the pumps
were started again.
Judge Wright also ordered the
city to pay its water bill of $889.50
for February to C. J. Lord, receiver
of the old company, after the city
had sought to escape payment of this
amount to offset the SBSO it had to
pay for the motor.
Try Railroad Tax Caae.

state equalisation board in 1912 Is
excessive and arbitrary has been in
progress this week bofore Judge D.
F. Wright In the local superior court.
The company alleges the proper val
uation is 839,000,000. This would
mean a reduction of $270,000 in the
company> taxes.

FATHER OBTAINS CHILO
Court Directs Grandparents to Give
O. J. Longmire Custody of His
Daughter.
Writ of habeas corpus directing
Mr. and Mrs. D. R. Hughes of Yelm
to give their little granddaughter
into the custody of her father, O. J.
Longmire of Roy, was signed by Su
perior Judge" D. F. Wright Wednes
day, after a hearing in the local
court. This ends a case that has at
tracted much attention.
Superior Judge Wright accepted
the contention of Attorney Thos. M.
Vance, representing Longmire, that
parents have the first claim on their
children, provided they are fit mor
ally to care for them, and ruled that,
during the hearing Monday evening,
no evidence was introduced proving
that Longmire was unfit to have his
child.
Longmire's first wife was 'the
daughter' of Mr. and Mrs. Hughes
and since her death child has
beenUared for by them. When Long
mire married the second time about
a year ago he sought the custody of
the child and finally brought habeas
corpuß proceedings to obtain her.

i With alfalfa bay already selling at
an nnheard-of high price, some sl2 a
ton above normal, and with the local
supply being shipped in from South-
I era Idaho and California, Olympia
and Thurston county are also feeling
! the shortage of this staple stock feed,
I which is reported to be serious
throughout the Northwest. Alfalfa

year is about sl6.
j Except for a slight increase in bran
and shorts, the priceß of the other
grains, wheat, oats, barley and corn,
'are reported by local dealers to be
slightly less than a year ago. Tim
othy hay is also commanding a high
i price, about $26 to $27, which is
considerably above normal, but the
shortage in the supply of that in this
territory is due to shortage of rail
road cars for shipment
I Reasons for Shortage.
No straw can be bought in the
Northwest today; Tacoma, Seattle
i and Portland dealers report a serious
< alfalfa shortage in those cities, while
, North Yakima And Walla Walla, two
|of the largest alfalfa producing dis
tricts in the state, have been ship
ping in hay for the last six weeks.
The unusually severe winter, a small
crop and the lack of transportation
facilities are the chief reasons gtvfcn
for the hay shortage. «•
Local dealers are paying now for
freight alone on carload shipment*
of hay as much as the hay, including
ftratgltt, generally costs them laid
down at their warehouses. The un
usually high price of alfalfa has nat
' urally tended to decrease the de
mand for it, and local dealers esti
jmate they hare enough on. hand or
en route here to BUpttf t Mr trade
for the remainder of the month,
when it is expected that pasture lands
will have reached the point where
the stock can be turned into them tor
feed.
Timothy is from It to 9? more
than it was a year ago, but at that la
considerably less than the high mark
reached" ten yqars ago. Moot of the
i local supply of this variety la halng
I shipped in from Ellen*burg, and tho
j chief difficulty the local dealers are
having -Is In obUlning cars for ship-
Ping. Tho local supply of alfalfa

Itrlct, and the purchaae of that va

. nia is most unusual,

member any time when there waa
such a shortage of hay In tho North
| west or the prices were aa high as
'they are now and have boon for tho
past few weeks.
