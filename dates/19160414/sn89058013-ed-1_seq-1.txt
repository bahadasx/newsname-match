THE. HONOR OP
A COW.BOY
Much interest is being manifest
ed iu the rendition of ''The honor
of a cowboy' a comedy drama iu
four acts, which will be -staged by
local talent at the higli school au
ditorium this evening.? This is one
of the most popular plays of Charles :
Ulricu, the well-kuown playwright,
who stands at the head of American
drama. ' ' .. . : ,. ' '
The story, which breathes tle
western spirit, is -entirely consi "
tent and the climaxes are reachefl
in the. plan without overdoing r
straining fh effect. We might say
further'The honor of a cowboy"
is a fine drama with genuine heart
iuterest, clever character outlines -and
is a strong h um au story told
with much skill and splendid lit
erary taste. Tile synopsis follows:
Act l An "Indian with a long
memory for spirits. ;A Sheriflf who '
is quick on the trigger; Remnant
of the .400 of New Jork. J udge
falls in love. ;The cowboys' race. "

trayal. ; Cowboy in love." Avowal.

stick to you to the end."
Act II Bandits at poker. , Scar
Face exposes a trick at cards. - The -Mexican
threatensilndiatt. Mary

age is awakening .the country to
one 6f its forms -of waste. All oM, .
papel- and old' rags may become.
'valuable audv furthermore, may
serve a genuinely, worthy purpose
by preventing a paper-famine in
this country. . '
Paper .which sold at cents'
some time ago is jdow bringing
cents, in rormer times -t wnn no
totaary for the United States to
umport $2,000,000 worth of rags -
from Jbu rope as a iase for paper.
iNow that has been cut off. It is
quite probable that the country ,
will, through n ecessi ty , make good
use'of its waste paper and ratrs.' It
will be a good experience, a Amer
ica needs to be taught thrift, and
the kind of thrift which makes En-
rope lield up is the thrift of usiuir
everything whieli'has a use.' Our
packers use evry part of the hotr
except its squeal, it, is said. But
