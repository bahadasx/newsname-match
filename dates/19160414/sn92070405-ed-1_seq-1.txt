death "Uncle Pete" wrote the

to tell all the "kids" that he was
bringing back a dozen more bicy

the Liberal would be delayed in the

cause.

plant as Roswell, he interested
himself with Z. T White in the or

Electric Light and Power Com

company for several years and then
disposed of his interest.

well pleased with the result of the
gathering.
Those who came to the meeting
to see "firef'WOrks" were sorely

who expected to see the usual
clashes in Lordsburg over an elec

away without their desires grati

and Lordsburg is out of the rut of
greedy political grab. The people
are looking out for their best in

"old ring" is beaten to a pulp. ,
