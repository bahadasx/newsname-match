Primary Election Returns.
Iowa's first presidential preference
primary election was a big joke with
the exception of the expense, which
will approach $100,000 in the state, or
an average of $1000 in the county. In
Howard County 555 votes were cast at
an expense of about $2.00 each to the
county.
But little interest was manifested,
and as a rule voters marked the first
name that appeared on the ballot. The
result is that on the democrat side
Dunn carried the county, while three
of those on the state in opposition to
the Dunn ticket received the county en
dorsement as delegates at large, the
fourth man on the list being G. A.
Meyer, a Dunn delegate, wliose name
appeared near the head of the list in
this county.

Hulls Sells Creamery to Farmers.
The Cresco Milk Company creamery
has been sold to a newly organized co
operative company styled the Farmers'
Co-Operative Creamery Association
who will take possession of their prop
erty on May 1st. We understand that
$3,900 was paid for the machinery and
outfit, including the lease of the build
ing which has a short time to run. The
incorporators hope to be able to finance
also the purchase of the building.
The articles of incorporation of the
new company provides for a capital
stock of $15,000 at $2 per share, so'd
only to farmers and transferable only
to farmers, on a basis of one share for
each milch cow owned by stockholders.
$4,000 of this capital stock is already
paid in and the company is desirous of
selling more stock to all other farmers
who may desire to become stockholders
and patrons. The officers are as
follows
President—Wm. Frank.
Vice-President—John Staebell.
Secretary—R. M. Thomson.
Treasurer—H. J. Webber.
Directors—W. G. Herzog, J. F.
Steinmetz, John Drilling, J. E. Baw
den and John Driscoll.
R. L. Baumgartner, the present but
termaker, will probably be retained in
that position, and a competent mana
ger secured. Mr. Hulls is somewhat
undecided as to his future location, but
it is rumored that he may remain in
the county, a rumor we trust will prove
a reality.

Repocts vary as to conditions of fall

what the crops have been seriously
damaged in many localities and the
acreage of winter wheat has been great
ly reduced. Many reports indicate 15
to 30 per cent damage and 25 to 60 per
reduction in acreage. Cold weather
has kept grass and fruit buds almost
dormant All live stock is in a healthy
condition and the spring pig crop will
be large. A good, warm rain would be
