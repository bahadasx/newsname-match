The great majority of Mexicans do
not know yet that the American sol
diers have crossed the international
line according to an American who
arrived hero from Mexico City. The
most profound ignorance regarding
the situation io Chihuahua prevails in
the capitol, even thc educated classes
getting contradictory reports. He ex
hibitad a copy of a Mexico City news
paper carrying only a couple of hun
dred words under an El Paso dato
line ao?t the Villa chase. This waa
dated a week back and did not men
tion Tho American troops but said the
constitutionalist forces had Villa
surrounded and his capture was
merely a question or hours. It also
informed the. public that Pershing
had been made commander at the
"Columbus Zone, in the state of New
Mexico."
The man said the people of South
Mexico comprising about four-fifths
of the populatloa know practically
nothing about.the Villa pursuit and
"caro less-." Some had heard stories
about the American troops being in
Mexico but regard thom as "Gringo
lies." < ...
The whole Mexican situation seems
to be a condition of suspended ani
mation at present from the border
viewpoint. Stories continue" to come
dally, of the burning of 'railroad
hrtdg?s and attacks? on trains .by ban
dits. Alarmists slezo these and ex
aggerate them but the conservative
element regards them as of little sig
nificance. ,
