WA8HINOTON, April 14. The
situation in Mexico It graver
than at any time during the
yean that have elapsed aince the be
ginning of the Msdero revolt . against
Porfirio Diaz. Carrataza, after weeks
of delay and dodging, baa at last ccme
forth flatly and asked the raited
Htates government to withdraw the
columns under General Perahing. On

xlUimi Ul thivrteytli hAS- Wa--ed
General tinsto at Ban Airfooio,
Ti-iaa, thai Gen., A Gomes, with a
large fo.-e e, is moving south-east in the
direction , of Casa Grandee, through
whiMi town the Americas lines of cum
mnnlektion with Pershing's force, four
nunurmi mile, south, are running. Oon
eral Funaton has issued orde s to scouts
to locate General Gomez and keen li
ilcse touch with him, but as yet there
nave necn no reports of his exart
whoreabouts. War department offi
cials, however, do not hesitate to ad
mit the poettibility of an attack, aud
the possible cutting of the American
ur.es.
Uenernl Carranza has informed tho
state department that the clash of the
American troopers and the Mexicans
at Pa ri al is proof that the continued
presence of Genoral Pershing's com
mand within the borders of Mexico is
1 railing to a situation "which threat -,
gfTs to become rapidly unrontrolable. "
Another DemanA Expected
In his note, which was delivered to
the state department by Doctor Arre
dondo, the Mexiran ambassador, the
head of the de facto government of
Mexico veils his insistance that the.
government withdraw General Per
shing under the form of a "'request,"
t ut no one here appears to doubt that
should that request be refused, an
other and more inaistant demand' will
be sent.
Htate department and other officials
are reticent about discussing the note
and will not predict the outcome.
There are no indications that the
tioops will lie withdrawn. The devel
opment, while not unex)Mcted has been
received in congress with divergent
views and there is a general undertone
of caution, and a disposition to con
tinue the present stage of matters.
Summary or Oarransa Note
The note itself is 5000
words In
a 1
length. It contends that the Amerl
cans crossed the Mexiran border with
out permission, and that they should
withdraw until a formal compact is
made. The note further says that the
United States incorrectly interpreted
the note of March 10. to which atten
tion was called on March IT. The
present expedition, it ia held, "has
fulfilled its object so far as it is able
to do so," and that sufficient Carrau-
zihub are pursuing Villa to guarantee
that he and his bandar-ill be iuuihed
President Wilsonhas cancelled his
speaking engagement for Saturday
night in New York.
Americans Fired Upon
The cbish betweeu' the men under
General I'ershing and the inhabitants
o( Parrul has brought almost to the
snapping point the situation in Mexico.
'I he Mexicans, never too friendly tu
the Americans, are said to be enfuriat
ed by the shooting of several of their
number. Official advices say that the
civiliunn of I'arral fired into the ranks
of the American troops while the lat
ter were marching through.
When the Americana entered the
t"wn. the IochI commander recalled the
American arsnrances that the United
Htates troops would not pass throuirh

Idea of Intervention Scouted By
Well-informed Circles In - y
Mikado's Capital
(Aasedatsd rrtss j TtintX Wireless.) '
TOKIO, April 14. The newspapers
of North China, and particularly of
Peking, aro becoming seriously alarmed
over the reports of the treaty between
Russia and .Japan. These reports de
clare that the agreement gives Japan
complete control of the political and
economic 'situation, in the Par East. 'It
ia claimed that the Czar s great need
of munitions and other war. materials
brought about the agreement. s
The belief here is that the revolution
ia rapidly nearing the climax, and that
it is becoming increasingly difficult for
Yuun Whin kai to maintain his position
as president of the republic. Official
opinion appears to be set against the
idea of intervention in Chinese affairs,
unless, as one oltirial expressed it yes
terday Japanese lives are endangered.
If intervention should be undertaken,
it was said, Nippon will art probably
as the representative of the allied pow
ers aa well as in her own interests.
This statement, it was pointed out, does
not mean that the rumor that the En
tente has granted Japan a free hand
ia the Orient has any basis on fact. On
the other, hand the report is scouted irX
