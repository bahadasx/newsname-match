STEAM SCHOONERS
ORDER FOR 3 VESSELS
Ht. Helens Plant, Unable to Handle
HunIiiomh, Kiililets to Astoria Yurl
Provision has been made In the
construction plans of the St. Helens
s,lP1,ulllll"K Company for two steum
scliooners for tho Charlea H. McCor
mlck Company, Instead of one, as
was decided on early In tho year,
while ono additional motorship Is
planned. Ono steam schooner and
the motorship or auxiliary schooner
will bo turned out at the Astoria
plant of Wilson Ilros., and the sec
ond steam schooner will bo built at
St. Helens.
The steam schooners will be of the
sumo typo as the Wapamu, each car
rying 1,200,000 feet, and tho auxil
iary schooner 2,000,000 feat, says
the Sunduy Orcgonlun.
II. F. McCormlck of the St. Hel
ens Shipbuilding Company, was at
Astoria yesterday completing details
of the contracts with Wilson Bros,
for the two vcbeoIs there, work on
which will bo started as soon as pos
sible. At the St. Helena plants the
auxiliary schooner City of Portland
will be launched shortly, probably the
latter part of tho week, and the City
of St. Helens, a sister ship, is on the
ways, the f ruined being in place.
Alongside of her the schooner Huby,
building for Captain Wrlghtson, of
Mobile, Ala., Is well along and will
luke tho water during the early part
of the summer.." She has been sold
iand a sitter ahlp ordered at the same
plant.
With the City of Portland off the
way. " of the steam schooners Is
to bo started In that space. The lat
ter, us well as the steamer provided
for at Astoria, will be about 215 feet
long, or about ton feet longer than
tho steamer Wapuma, while they will
resemblo her In other ways. While
she carries about 1,050,000 feet of
I liimhni. Ilmv will llHVA CAn&cltV for
cIobo to 1,200,000 feet. It was in
tended to build the ver.sel Bteamor to
carry 1,500,000 feet, but Buccess at
talned with the Wapama has resulted
In tho dimensions being altered, so as
to follow her lines, with only trivial
Increase in size.
It was because of the dotermln
atlon to add two steam schooners to
the fleet that contracts were awarded
to Wilson Bros., as tho St. Helens
plant Is operating to capacity. The
auxiliary schooner to be built there
will bo luld down on the same lines as
tho City of Portland and City of St
Holons, which are each to carry 2,
000,000 foot of lumber.

Ten
Aliens Are Made Citizens of
These United States
A number of foreigners were made
good American citizens this week be

ered a good wholesome talk and ex

giance to the United States, J. M.
Ltndsey, a Confederate veteran who
fought In the battle of Gettysburg,
waved over the newly made citizens
tho stars and stripes, the same flag
that he fought against some 50 years
ago. The Incident created no little
comment and goes to show that there
is no such a thing as north, Bouth,
east or west, but that we are all one
nation who will protect the one flag.
Citizenship was granted to the fol
lowing: John A. Hurula of Sweden;
Klna Parlanen of Finland; Andrew
Wirkkala of Finland; Pierre Canl
paroll of Italy; Thomas Isbister of

CITY OF PORTLAND
LAUNCHED SATURDAY
Bottle of "Something" to Be
Broken on the Bow
The Chas. R. McCormlck Co.,
owners of the St. Helens Shipbuild
ing Company, have Issued very neat
invitations to the citizens of Oregon
to be in St. Helens Saturday to wit
ness the launching of the big motor
vessel, the City of Portland, Saturday
afternoon, April 15, at 3 o'clock.
Promptly at that hour Miss Wiggins,
the young daughter of W. B. Wiggins,
part owners of the St. Helens Creo
soting Company, and senior member
of the firm of Broughton & Wiggins,
will break a bottle of "something"
on the bow of the City of Portland
and at this signal workmen will per
form the necessary labor to send the
big vessel gliding down the ways into
the waters of the Columbia. The
launching of this vessel marks an
epoch in the shipbuilding industry of
the Pacific Coast isasmuch as she U
the largest single deck wooden ves
sel yet built, the largest motor vessel
ever built in the United States. Ir
has required about eight months to
build the vessel and has given em
ployment to some hundred men who
are now making their final work ou
her. In her construction nearly two
million feet of lumber - have been
used and some hundreds of tons of
bolts have been used to fasten her
together. A number of prominent
men of Oregon and other Western
states will be here to witness the
launching. A more extended account
of the launching and the vessel will
appear in the next issue of the Mist.
INSPECTS ROAD
County Judge Clark on Monday
inspected the Frink road with a view
towards ascertaining what could be
done towards putting it in good con
dltlon. The amount appropriated for
this stretch of road Is only S35C0
while the judge figures It will take
several times that amount to put it
in such condition as to make It pass
able the whole year. The county
court will make some Improvements
and endeavor to make the amount
appropriated go as far as possible.
The Frink road leads from Scapponre
to Spltzenberg and with that section
of the county rapidly settling up, a
good road is much needed.
CAPTAIN EDWARD JAHNSEN
Captain Edward Jahnsen, after a
Test of several months, has. resumed
command of the steamer Klamath,
relieving Capt. "Alvena" Johnson,
who will take charge of the motor
vessel "City of Portland." Captain
Jahnsen has been In command of
every vessel operated by the McCor
mlck people and Is regarded as one
of the raoBt careful mariners on the
Pacific Coast. He has been going to
sea since 1870 and states that he has
never seen a sailor drowned, a ves
sel wrecked or any accident of any
consequence during his 46 years at
sea, which goes to show that a man
really is in no more danger at sea
than if on land. Captain Jahnsen
was kept busy shaking hands with his
ninny friends here.
