MNCOLN FARM, NEAR IIODGEN
VILLE, ACCEPTED MY ,
CONGRESS.
NO OPPOSITION TO BILL
Hop. Johnson Introduces Measure
"Uncle" Joe Cannon- SpeaksT"
On Lincoln,
p r r . :
Washington, April 12. Without
n dissenting voice tho House today
passed the bill making the Lincoln
Memorial Farm near Hodgenvlile a
national park. A similar measuro
Is pending In tho Senato, and as there
la no opposition to It there seems lit;
tie doubt that deed of title to the
property now In possession of Presi
dent Wilson will be signed during
this session.
The Lincoln Farm Bill was intro
duced by Representative Den John
son. Consideration of the measuro
was the occasion for a flood of tri
butes to tho memory of Lincoln, in
'which Kentucky and Kentucklans re
ceived warm praise.
Debate began last Wednesday, Mr.
Johnson spoke for his bill and Rep
resentative Alben W. Barkley made
closing speech. Mr. Barkley held
that it is but fitting that the people
of the United States, by accepting
from the people of Kentucky as al
playground for the nation the Lin
coin Farm in Larue county, as this
year marks tho hundredth annlversa
ry of Lincoln's departure from his
birthplace.
"The story of no single man In
American public lite so touches the
tender chords of the heart as does
that of Lincoln," said Mr. Barkley.
"Surely no other career encompasses
ao tremendous a sweep from humble
origin to imperishable famo. Today
Jet our minds wander back to that
poor homo In the Kentucky hills of
Nolen'a Creek where ho fished, hunt
ed and played like other boys, and
where ho listened to tho gentle voice,
of her whom ho tn after years was
proud to call his saintly mother."
Mr. Barkley referred to the proud
history ot his State and pointed out
what her sons had done for the na
tion, both in Kentucky and when they
vent to other parts ot the country.
"In all this list two names stand.
out pre-eminent," ho said. "Wo fre
quently marvel at the peculiar cir
cumstances by which the careers ot
men are hedged about. But who can
explain on any other theory that tho
guidance of a Providential band, the
fact that both Jefferson Davis and
Abraham Lincoln, rival leaders In the
great Clyll War, wcro born under
Kentucky's sun and woro nestled to
tho bosom ot two of her noble-women?
As tho nation will this day ac
cept tho gift of Lincoln's home, so
may wo liopb that a day' not long
postponed a similar acceptance of tho
Davis homo may bo recorded, and
.that theso two sacred spots may bo
forever enshrined in tho lovo and im
agination of patriots everywhere, ty
pifying the reunion ot heart and hopo
and hand through' which our common
country shall more and nioro becomo
tho land of boundless opportunity for
servlco and devotion, to tho end that
-wo and thoso who shall follow us
may bo nblo to adopt as tho motto ot
our 11V03 that subllmo sontenco of
Lincoln's whon ho said:
" 'I am not bound to win, but I
.am 'bound to bo right.'"
Gen. Isaac Sherwood, Congress
man from Ohio; Representative Rus-
soil, ot Missouri, and Sloan, ot Ne
braska, and former Speaker Cannon
spoke In favqr ot a unanimous voto
on tho bill.
As it wub known in advanco that
"Uncle Joo" was to speak on the
(Kentucky gift, practically every
member ot the Hduso-was present
Tie spoko tor more than an hour. He
-went into the details ot the settle
ment ot Illinois, Lincoln's early ca
reer, his contest with Douglas and
'finally his relations with Greeley. His
-.remarks were dotted with many sto
ries of Lincoln's life, and although
the former Speaker's time expired
several times the House refused to
allow him to be checked until he had
completed his speech.
"Lincoln -was bora in Kentucky
tit I recollect right, oh the 12th day
of February, 'lfrr"tid Mr, Cannon,
"No one could have dreamed what
his future would be. They have
found tho log cabin whero ho was
born, the place upon which it stood,
tho farm upon which his father fail
ed to mako a living and it has been
purchased and endowed with $50,
000, and is now tendered to the Gov
ernment of the United States. It Is
meet and 'proper, in my Judgment,
that this bill should pass.
"We aro building a great memor
ial to Lincoln here' in tho city of
Washington, but that memorial
marks his service as a lawyer, as a
statesman, as a President. But af
ter all, if he had not been born he
would not havo been, President."
