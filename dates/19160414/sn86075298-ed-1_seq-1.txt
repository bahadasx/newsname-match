SENATOR FALL
SENDS REPORT
Washington, April 11.-Senator Fall
of New Mexico, who, at the request of
Republican senators, went to the bor
der immediately after Villa's raid on
Columbus, to investigate general con
ditions there, declared in a letter re
ceived by Senator Gallinger, the mi
nority leader, that Carranza troops
were not co-operating with the Ameri
can expedition in any way or making
any attempt to attack Villa.
He complained that the border pa
trol was not being maintained in ade
quate force and said an unguarded
gap of nine miles had made the Co
lumbus raid possible.
The letter was written in El Paso,
April 4. It quoted an unnamed au
thority as saying that unless a more
satisfactory use of the Mexican rail
ways were made possible within one
week the American troops must with
draw and said reliable information
had reached the senator that Villa had
not been wounded.
Describing in detail the Columbus
raid, from information gathered from
Columbus officials, Senator Fall said
the bandits had made their way into
the heart of the town, looted two
:tnres and set fire to several build
ings before an alarm was given.
With the aid of a machine gun,
placed within twenty feet of the
American army hospital, he said, the
Mm xicans then fought with the citi
zruns of the town for another fifty min
u 10s before the troopers, stationed be
bind the hospital, appeared.
TROOPS PATROL COLUMBUS
Military Authorities Are Prepared to
Battle Raiders.
Columbus. N. M., April 11.-More
soldiers are on guard in Columbus
than at any time since the town was
raided by Villa bandits, a month ago.
Soldiers patrol all the streets and
the military reservation, while one
<ympany of infantry has been order
ed to sleep under arms.
Instructions have been issued to
imeep all the gun racks unlocked.
Increased precaution to guard the
military base at Columbus and the
American line of communication, the
arrival of a number of strangers in
town and what seemed to be an air of
suppressed excitement about military
?:f adquarters all contribute to the be.
lies that the authorities believe there
are about to be important develop.
ments in the punitive campaign in
Mexico.
MEXICAN OFFICIALS UNEASY
Seem Anxious for Americans to Evac
uate at Once.
Washington, April 11.-State de
partment dispatches indicate that the
Carranza authorities are viewing with
some anxiety the continued presence
of American troops in Mexico and are
inclined to believe that the object of
the expedition has been accomplished
in the dispersal of Villa's main com
mand.
It is stated, however, that there has
been no suggestion from the de facto
government as to a "dead line" be
yond which the American troops
should not go, or as to a date on
which they should be withdrawn.
UNCLE SAM TO BUY
HAMMOND TORPEDO
Washins ton, April 11.-Uncle Sam
is about to purchase for $,,0,000 an
invention which all the gold of the
belligr-rent countries cannot buy. The
purn hase will carry with it the ex
clusive right to use a device by which
a torpedo can be launched against the
battleships of an enemy and so di
rected and controlled by radio dy
namic forces either from shore or
from an aeroplane as to insure its
striking its mark at a maximum dis
tance of twenty-eight miles.
John Hays Hammond, Jr., of Glou
cester, Mass., the wizard son of John
Hays Hammond, the mining engineer,
is the inventor and owner of 128 pat
ents which will be turned over to he
government.
Although ouly twenty-six years old
young Hammond has accomplished
what many military scientists of other
countries have tried to perfect and
failed.
War On Flies
Don't wait till warm weather comes
when flies will breed so fast that we
can not be able to deal with them; get
to work now and hunt out their breed
ing places and clean them out. Haul
out the manure; disinfect the closets,
burn up all rubbish before the pests
have time to breed. This kind of war
fare calls for the co-operrtion of every
man, woman and child in the com
munity. Every fly destroyed now
means millions less latter in the season.
Swat the fly, and swat him early.
To Stop Bond Sale
Proceedings to enjoin State Treasurer
Rae from issuing $100,000 worth of in
terest-bearing bonds designed "First
Mortgage Farm Loan Saving Bonds"
have been instituted in the district
court at Helena by George H. Hill, a
capitalist of that city.
The plaintiff alleges there is no war
rant or authority of law for the issuance
of such bonds and that the expenditure
of the money is contrary to the provi
sions of the constitution of the state.
The hearing will be held April 21st.

PUSHING PRELIMINARY WORK
ON FLATHEAD ELECTRIO ROAD
The incorporation committee of the
Missoula Chamber of Commerce, ap
pointed some days ago, following the
reservation railroad meeting in Mis
soula, met in Poison Saturday last, says
a Poison dispatch of that date. The
members of the committee present were
Major Smead of Missoula, George H.
Beckwith of St. Ignatius, Stanley
Scearce of Ronan and J. H. Cline of
Poison.
A discussion was had relative to the
preliminary steps to be taken in incor
porating the Missoula-Polson Railway
company and this resulted in a decision
to proceed with the preliminary survey
of the route through St. Mary's Pass
and to have an expert proceed with the
gathering of statistical information
relative to tonnage and right of way.
Late in the afternoon arrangements
were completed for the survey and the
work was financed.
Major Smead, chairman of the com
mittee, said this evening:
"The committee finds much enthu
siasm and offers of active support all
through the reservation. Poison peo
ple are especially enthusiastic.There is
no question in my mind, after what we
were able to accomplish today, but that
we are on the high road to success in
the building of the Missoula-Polson
electric road.
School Board Meeting
The regular quarterly meeting of.the
School Board will be held at St. Igna
tius, Saturday, April 15, at 10 a. m.

NORTHERN PACIFIC PARTY
OPEN HEADQUARTERS HERE
Yesterday morning the advance
guard of a party of Northern Pacific
engineers arrived in Ronan and immed
iately set about the establishing of
headquarters, Mr. C. D. Blanchard
apparently was head of the first ar
rivals, three in number, and secured
the refusal of rooms at the Rothan
hotel for a party of ten. In addition to
sleeping rooms we understand other a
partments to be used for an office and
work rooms for the draftsmen are in
cluded.
Late yesterday evening seven more
arrived, among them being Engineer C.
W. Mowery, in charge of the party.
Further than stating that they were
in the employ of the Nortnarn Pacific
and were here to go over the old survey
and possibly make others, they had
nothing to give out, and the real object
PROCEEDS WITH
UNABATED FURY
Paris, April 11.-The battle around
Verdun is proceeding with unabated
fury.
To the west of the Meuse a bom
bardment of increasing intensity is
reported in the French official com
munication issued.
Fierce German attacks were deliv
ered against the French front south
of the Forges brook, but, although the
Germans have suffered serious losses,
the French line between Le Mort
Hommne and Cumieres remained un
broken.
PREDICTS VERDUN VICTORY
War Minister Declares Germany Is
Not Exhausted.
Berlin, April 11.-The German war
minister, General Adolf Hohenborn,
has made the following statement in
the reichstag concerning the Verdun
offensive:
"These are not, as our enemies pre
tend to believe, the last efforts of an
exhausted nation, but the hammer
blows of a strong, unconquerable per
ple, provided with sufficient human
reserves and all necessary means for
backing up the hammer blows, which
will be repeated until our adversaries
weary."
SUFFER HEAVY CASUALTIES
Berlin Reports French Counter At
tacks Fruitless.
Berlin, April 11.-Exceptionally
heavy French losses are reported In
connection with the German advance
south of Haucourt, by which the Ba
varian and Silesian troops now occupy
the heights of the so-called Termiten
hill.
The French losses within a few
hours were increased by a counter at
tack on the lost position, which failed
utterly.
The captured positions are more
than 1,000 yards in width.
KING ALBERT IS GRATEFUL
Cables His Thanks for Efforts to Raise
Relief Funds.
New York, April 11.-A cahlegram
from King Albert of the Belgians to
the commission for relief in Belgium
was made public here as follows:
"All my best thanks for the wishes
that come from you and from the
American people co-operating with the
commission for relief in Belgium that
you have expressed to me."
King Albert alluded to the expres
sicn of good wishes sent to him on the
occasion of his birth.
Italians Defeat Austrians.
Rome, April 11.-The following of
ficlal communication was issued:
"There have been artillery actions
along the whole front. On the Mrsli
Saturday night, after strong enemy
detachments approached our lines and
threw heavy bombs, our troops burst
into the enemy trenches and defeated
him In a hand to hand conflict."
German Losses 2,730,917.
London, April 11.-German losses in
the war to date are 2,730,917, Lon
don newspapers figure by adding the
German official casualty lists. Of
these 681,437 have been killed.
Money talks, but all of Carnegie's
millions can't coax the scrappers over
there to atop and ifsten,
of the visit must be left to conjecture,
at least for the present.
Some are of the opinion that the
present move on the part of the Nor
thern Pacific is a bluff to head off the
proposed electric road from Missoula to
PoIson, while others are as confident
that they mean business and that ac
tual construction work on the line from
Dixon into the valley will be under
headway in the very near future.
One thing sure, however, is that the
Northern Pacific people have not for
gotten us entirely and the fact that
their engineers are here, in Ronan, is
evidence that whatever activity results
will be in our immediate vicinity. Ro
nan welcomes the engineers and trusts
that their visit is preliminary to the
speedy arrival of the road itself. It
looks good, and let us hope for the
best.
PRINCE NICHOLAS.
Pleads With Allies for Bet
ter Treatment for Greece.
Prince Nicholas, in a letter sent to
Lord Burnham at London, complain:
that Grecian maritime communica
tions have been paralyzed and that
the country is on the vergce of starva
tion.
ASQUITH REPLIES TO
GERMAN CHANCELLOR
London, April 11.--On the occasion
of a government reception to visiting
French senators and deputies at Lan
caster house Premier Asquith tool
the opportunity to reply to the speech
recently delivered in the reichstag by
the imperial German chancellor, Dr.
von lethmann-llollweg.
The premier, in proposing the toast
"Our Ciosts," referred to von Beth
mann-flollweg's claim to readiness on
the part of the Germans to negoliat'
peace and said:
"The German chancellor wants us
to assumeni the attitude of a defeated
foe to our victorious adversary. But
we are not defeated; we are not go
lug to be defeated."
Reiterating that the entente allies
are prepared only for peace on the
terms of his declaration of November,
1914, Mr. Asquith proceeded:
"The chancellor first misquotes my
language and then proceeds to distort
its obvious meaning and intention
Great Britain and France entered the
war not to strangle Germany or wipe
her off the may of Europe; not to de
stroy or mutilate her national life;
certainly not to interfere with, to use
the chancellor's language, the free ex
ercise of her peaceful endeavors.
"As a result of the war we intend
to establish the principle that inter
national problems must be handled by
free negotiations on equal terms be
tween free peoples, and that this set
tleipent shall no longer be hampered
or swayed by the over-mastering die
tation of a government controlled by
a military caste. This is what I
mean by the destruction of the mili
tary domination of Prussia-nothing
more, but nothing less."
Hopewell is considering a change of
its name to "Tryagain."
Ross Gets Contract
Percy Ross has been awarded a $14,
000 earthwork and construction contract
on the Mission, Post creek and Pablo
divisions of the Flathead project. Mr.
Ross at present has his outfit between
Poison and Big Arm but will complete
his work there shortly and move to the
neighborhood of Ronan and commence
on his new contract.
OUR 1915 CROP EXCEEDS
TWO MILLION BUSHELS
Superintendent Fred C. Morgan of
the Flathead Agency has compiled fig
ures on the grain crop of the reserva
tion for 1915, showing a wonderful yield
of all small grains. Mr. Morgan se
cured his figures from the several own
ers of threshing machines running last
fall and are undoubtedly as accurate as
it would be possible to get. The report
gives the production by districts and
also the number of bushels raised by
Indians, lesses and homesteaders. The
capitulation shows a grand total as fol
lows:
Raised by Wheat Oats Barley Rye
Indians ----.-.-235,195 140.337 10.331 _
Lesses-_ .....--295,652 150,387 21,326 1,092
Homesteaders 1,199:333 504,973 79,815 31,508
Total 1,730,181 796,457 111.472 32,600
From the above it will be seen that
the total production of small grain on
the reservation last year reached
2,669,710 bushels. The average yield
per acre was: Wheat, 30 bushels; oats,
50 bushels; barley, 35 bushels: rye, 35
bushels.

ADMITS SINKING FIVE SHIPS
BUT SAYS SHE HAD RIGHT
The German reply to the American
note concerning the damaging or sink
ing of five steamships contains the
statement that the steamers Engishman,
Eagle Point, Manchester Engineer and
Berwindale were destroyed by German
submarines. Evidence is presented to
show that tteae vessels were torpedoed
legally in accordance with the rules of
war.
The note states that a German sub
marine torpedoed a steamship in the
vicinity of the place at which the cross
channel steamship Sussex was damaged
by an explosion, but that the evidence
at hand indicates that the vessel tor
pedoed by the submarine was not the
Sussex.
BRITISH RECAPTURE CRATER
London, April 11.-The British of
ficial communication issued said:
"At St. Eloi our troops attacked
and captured the mine crater remain
ing in German hands and by a further
attack succeeded in establishing
themselves in German trenches run
ning southwest from the above cra
ter."
GERMAN NOTE IS
EXPECTED SOON
Washington, April 11.-Investiga
tion of recent attacks on unarmed
merchantmen, carrying Americans,
has developed such a convincing array
of evidence pointing to illegal subma
rine operations that the United States
government has determined the re
sulting grave stiunation cannot be
cleared up by the German note, deny
ing that a German submarine torpe
doed the English channel steamer Sus
sex and disclaiming blame for attacks
on other ships inquired about by Anm
bassador Gerard.
The news that Ambassador Gerard
would be handed the German dis
claimer soon had been forecast in
press reports.
President Wilson and Secretary
Lansing still are waiting both for the
communication from Berlin and for
further information from other
sources.
Much Importance is attached to affi
davits and evidence gathered by the
American embassy at Paris and due
to reach New York Thursday on the
liner St. Paul.
It was learned, too, that Mr. Lan
sing is awaiting the outcome of an
inquiry at Paris about the case of Ihe
liner Patria, at which a torpedo is al
leged to have been fired some time
ago.
That some definite action will fol
low promptly on receipt of Germany's
disclaimer and other evidence is free
ly admitted, but no one in the conft
dence of the admlinistration will dis
-us8 what may be its nature, jI
There is a general understanding,
however, that no rupture of diplomat
is relations is imminent and that if
such a crisis does arise the president
I will go before congregs.
BERLIN NOT RESPONSIBLE
Note Will Deny Torpedoing Channel
Steamer Sussex.
Berlin, April 11.-The German note,
in response to inquiries of the Ameri
can government regarding the chan
nel steamer Sussex and the steamers
Englishman, Manchester Engineer,
Eagle Point and Berwindvale, de
clares, as previously cabled, that the
reports of the commanders of subma
rines which might possibly have been
involved in an attack on the Sussex,
made it absolutely certain the Sussex
was not torpedoed by a German tore
pedo. #1
Likewise, Germany denies respon
sibility for the sinking of the other
steamers, evidence having been ad
duced at the investigation to show
that no blame attached to Germany.
MILLERS ATTACK GRAIN RATE
Minneapolis Flour Firms Charge In
crease Is Unwarranted.
Washington, April 11.-Minneapolis
milling companies petitioned the in
terstate commerce commission to set
aside an increase of approximately 5
per cent, effective Nov. 16, 1914, in
rates on grain from Iowa, Minnesota,
South Dakota and other Northwestern
states to points in the Middle West.
The increase applies to grain milled
in transit in Minneapolis and is at
tacked as unwarranted. Reparation
is asked for alleged excessive freight
charges paid.
NO TARIFF ON COAL TAR DYE
Senate Rejects, 41 to 25, Amendment
to Include Rate.
Washington, April 11.-The senate
rejected, 41 to 25, an amendment by
Senator Lodge to include a tariff on
coal tar dyes in the bill providing for
Tetention of the present tariff of a
cent a pound on sugar until 1920.
Senator Norris of Nebraska was the
