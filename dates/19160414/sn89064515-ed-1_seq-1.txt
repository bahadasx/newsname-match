NICK KULLAS VICTIM OF ACCI
DENT FIRST DAT MILL
BUNS
After sawing had been in progress
for only a day, at the saw mill here,
an accident occurred in which Nick
Kullas of this city sustained ^jferee
broken ribs and was slightly bmwd.|
The accident occurred Wednesday
evening at about 7 o'clock, shortly,
after the night shift had gone to
work. The sawyer on the carriage,
on which Kullas was working, lost
control of it in some manner and it
Tan away, throwing Kullas and an
ether carriage man off. Kullas was
thrown with such violence as to cause
the injuries mentioned. The oth9r
man escaped uninjured.
Mr. Kullas was taken to St. Gabriel's
hospital for surgical aid. His injur
ies are not considered serious and he
will probably be out in a few weeks.
CIVIC LEAGUE
The regular monthly meeting of
the Civic League was held on Tues
day.
The visiting nurse made her final
report of work done and tendered
her resignation to take effect imme
dately, which was accepted. She was
engaged for a period of three months
but served not quite two. The league
will not engage any nurse until next
fall or winter.
The league also decided to join the
Minnesota Federation of Woman's
clubs and application to that effect
was duly signed and the membership
dues paid.
The president was also authorized
to appoint four delegates to the dis
trict convention of the Minnesota
Federation of Woman's clubs to be
held at Deerwood May 9 and 10, such
delegates, however, to pay their own
expenses.
The league also decided on the last
Saturday in the month of September
as the annual Tag Day for the league.
Mr. Kasparek of the Park commit
tee made a report touching the mat
ter of planting trees along Broadway
west. Nothing definite was decided
but Mr. Kasparek was authorized to
go ahead and do the best he could in
the matter. Mr. Kasparek also re
ported that he had secured the ap
pointment of special policeman to act
in the Pine Grove Park on Sundays,
that said policeman would serve free
of charge.
The president was requested to
urge the Membership committee to so
licit members and if he was unable
to get the committee to do anything
then to engage some person to try to
sell membership cards and pay him
for his services.
GIRL WHO LEFT HOME FOUND
MISS BLANCHE LEWIS FOUND IN
FREEDHEM—HAD NO FOOD
FOR FIVE DAYS
After having wandered about in
the country for over live days, with
out anything to eat and sleeping in
haystacks, Miss Blanche Lewis of this
city was found by Morris Olson of
Freedhem on the road near his home,
which is about seven miles from this
city. She disappeared from home at
8 o'clock a. m. on April 5.
Mr. Olson asked the girl'to accom
pany him, but she refused. He then
went to the home of Lyman Ayer,
nearby, where he telephoned to Sheriff
Feiix an.i( informed him that Miss
-Lewis had been found. She was
brought to Little Falls by the sheriff
and was taken to St. Gabriel's hos
pital for treatment. She was in a
weakened condition and was barely
able to speak.
Upon being questioned Miss Lewis
stated that she blamed no one for her
disappearance. She saia that she
could not remember what had trans
pired since she left home and she evi
dently was slightly deranged at the
time. She is still very weak and her
hands and feet are badly '"blistered
from exposure.
DAMAGED FISH SCREENS IN
GREEN PRAIRIE
Farmers living in Green Prairie
have complained to this county about
the damaging of fish screen in the
county ditches there by Little Falls
men. They also claim that men here

places and damaged a boat at Fish
Lake. It is stated that the parties
are known.
A penalty of from $50 to $500 has
been fixed by the county commission
ers for disturbing the fish screens.
The one said to have been damaged
is located in ditch No. 1.

WMT TO TAKE mr POWER
WATER POWER CO. CLAIMS N. W.
MILLING CO. VIOLATED CON
TRACTS—CASE IN COURTS
A temporary restraining order was
issued by Judge Roeser of St. Cloud
Monday prohibiting the Little Falls
Water Power company from shutting
off the water supply to the mill of
the Northwestern Milling company of
this city. A hearing was held- before
him on that day on the. milling com
pany's application for a temporary
injunction to prevent the water power
company from carrying out its threat
of shutting off the water supply and
the judge took the case under advise
ment and will probably render a de
cision in a few days.
A case has already been started in
district court here by the Water Pow
er company against the milling com
pany, charging them with using a
greater supply of water than they
contracted for. Their threat to crip
ple the mill's power supply was pro
tested, however, the milling company
claiming that it would ruin it, as it
would be impossible for them to in
stall a power plant in less than three
months.
FAIR CROWD HEARD GOULD
A fair sized crowd turned out last
Wednesday evening to hear Herbert
Gould of Chicago in concert at the
high school auditorium, under the
auspices of the Choral club. He gave
a program consisting of ten numbers
of one to three songs each. Miss
Christelle Colburn of Chicago, pre
sided at the piano. Of the songs Mr.
Gould sang the lighter kind seemed
to please the best.
The club realized a small sum from
the concert, which was the last of
the season to be given by that organ
ization.

of this kind,
pardoning power. Ita primary pur
pose at first was and still is that of
correcting excessive sentences, by
commuting them, or pardoning the
prisoners in cases of innocence prov
ed.
The board of parole consists of one
member of the state board of control,
being the one longest in service on
that board, also one citizen member,
the warden of the state prison and the
superintendent of the state reforma
tory. This board can parole anyone
who is serving an indeterminate sen
tence, anyone who was sentenced un-

prisoners after they have served
twenty-three years, 7 months and a
few days.
The -board of control has direct con
trol over thirteen state institutions
and has financial control over three.
It erects all buildings for the state
except those at the state fair grounds,
and buys the fuel for all except for
the state fair and for the soldiers'
home. It settles the residence of pau
pers in case of a dispute between two
counties, and has many other duties.
It was instituted in 1901 and succeed
ed a multiplication of other boards
and was intended to centralize the
work and to reduce the expenses of
the state government. Since the Min
nesota board was instituted many oth
er states have adopted the same plan.
At the present time the state is
caring for about 6,000 insane persons
in institutions. This state is one of
six in the union where there is no
charge for the care of the insane. Mr.
Yasaly stated, however, that he did
not believe that the state should as
sume the entire burden of the care
of insane patients. A bill was intro
duced in the state legislature propos
ing a charge for the care of patients
but it did not get through. Mr. Vas
aly said that he believed that the un
fortunate in this state are given
equally as good care as in any other
state and as good as in the sanitai*
iums. The state seeks to keep the
best employes at all times but of
course cannot afford to pay very high
salaries, and even if it could, probably
very little would be gained. Investi
gation of the institutions will show
that there is everything to commend
and little to condemn.
In the past it has been found that
a great number of old people who
could easily be cared for by relatives,
have been sent to the institutions
simply to get rid of them. They be
come a nuisance in the home of the
relatives because of the need of exr
tra care and at the first opportunity
are sent to the insane hospital. Mr.
Vasaly was of the opinion that if a
charge of $15 per month be made in
such eases the relatives would hesi
tate to send them there.

Among the events suggested were
an automobile floral parade, with

day, a baseball team, a picnic dinner
to be held at the Pine Grove park or

a lodge •jj&fade, and) fire works in the
evening. Mayor Fortier also suggest
ed a parade which will no doubt be
given,^ if possible. His suggestion
was th&t nil the different nationalities
in the city be grouped under their re
spective flags, and march in parade,
and come into one large group under
the American flag, to illustrate the
meaning of the name by which the
United States is becoming familiarly

The committee will get busy with
arrangements and will raise the ne

ON N. P. FROM BICES TO LITTLE
FAUfl—MAY CHANGE LINE
TO STAPLES
There is a report in circulation that
the Northern Pacific will this year
continue double-tracking in this di
vision, and that this summer will see
the extension of the double track from
Kiee to Little Falls* While no offi
cial information has been given -out,
the report is thought reliable. It is
known that the Northern Pacific man
agement is laboring to improve con
ditions on its lines,, reducing grades,
straightening curves" and making
travel safer as well as more comfort
able^ for passengers, also making it
possible to improve the freight traf
fic situation. The Northern Pacific
has always ranked as the most pro
gressive of the great transcontinental
lines, and^ its double-tracking is par
ticularly in the line of progress.
It is also understood that the new
survey for better grades between Lit
tle Falls and Staples has been ap
proved. It will not deviate much
from the present line, but will be
very much easier in grades, although
somewhat longer in distance.

BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS
The board of public works will meet
tonight to receive bids for the con
struction of the sewer on Second
street northeast.
At a meeting held Tuesday eve
ning the board organized and elected
N. N. Bergheim president and Victor
Schallern clerk. 'No action was taken
in regard to the paving petition, the
clerk being instructed to make in
quiries as to the advisability of pav
ing with concrete.
etc. Two parole agents, a man and a
woman, travel over the state and visit
those on parole from the institution
and enlighten those around them how
to get along with them and how to
care for them properly. These agents
have helped a great deal to enlighten
the people as to the treatment of one
who is mentally deranged.
Insanity, Mr. Vasaly said, is not
a disgrace to anyone and should be
considered a disease the same as ty
phoid or scarlet fever. There is a
great fear or insane persons but it is
a fact that if they are treated.. right
they are harmless in most instances.
There are some who are violent but
these are comparatively few and they
are safe in the institution. The prob
lem of the insane is a serious one as
the percentage is continually growing,
at the rate of 2 to 3 per cent ner
year. Minnesota is one of the high
percentage states in the union and
the need of a fourth institution for
the care of these, patients is already
being felt. The hospitals are crowded
and at the Rochester institution many
sleep on cots in the hallways. The
Anoka institution now has a popula
tion of nearly 900, and the population
limit is considered 1,000. The speaker
stated that he considered it a great
mistake to have too large a popula
tion, even though the cost of caring
for the inmates might be reduced in
this way, as they could not be given
the proper attention and care.

HATOK mOES OBMMKE
SAYS CHAUTAUQUA ORDINANCE
IS CLASS LEGISLATION—AND
THAT CITIZENS OBJECT
further decline to approve and1
sign the said amended ordinance on
the grounds that it appears to ne to
be purely and simply a piece of class
legislation, opening a way for much
trouble and dissatisfaction in the fu
ture.
I believe,.that an ordinance is for
the purpose of general,'orderly, regu
lation, and that when exceptions are
specificallv made,: and ^ordinances
amended for Ane reason or another, ih
favor of some person or persons, it
will be hard to tell when and where
it will end why and to whom it shall
•be granted or denied.
The ordinance refuses police pro-'
tection, by the city, to the Chautau
qua. This is plainly a capital offense
against the spirit of our charter, and
a violation of sections 1, 2, 3, 4 aiyl
6, but especially Sec. 5 of ordinace
No. 3 entitled. 'An Ordinace con
cerning offences asrainst the good or
der of the city of Little Falls."-What
assurances have you that the .city will
not be called upon to furnish one,
two, or more police, and, if a ju8t
demand is made, what course shall the
mavor follow?
Gentlemen of the council, I have
no objection whatever to the Chau
tauqua coming to our city, and I do
not believe that the wiinin^nm license
of Fifteen dollars, an insignificant
amount to pay or to receive,, could
interfere with its visit to Little' Falls,
but, if the council thinks so, and de
sires that the ordinance shall become
effective, it mav do so without' my
co-operation, and take upon itself the
whole responsibility of its action.
Respectfully submitted,
'G. M.. A. Fortier, Mayor.
