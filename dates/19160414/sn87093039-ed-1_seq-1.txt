CHELAN CO. SCHOOLS
MAKE GOOD SHOWING
Interest in the Work and Continous At
tendance Praised by State
Superintendent
Of the 287 graduates of the rural
and smaller city grammar schools in
Chelan county none are loafing, accord
ing to the educational and vocational
inrvey of the eighth gTade graduates
being made by State Superintendent
of Public Instruction Preston. The
others are reported as engaged in some
trade, attending school, or helping
with the house or farm work at home.
"This is a splendid record," said
Mrs. Preston. "The boys and girls
who are busy are seldom met with in
police courts or corrective institutions.
I am very much interested in helping
the seven boys and eighteen girls of
Chelan county who remain at home as
sisting their parents. I have received
letters from girls in Chelan and other
counties saying that their mothers are
ill, in some cases dead, and that they
are keeping house and taking care of
their families. Often the boys write
that they are helping their fathers with
the farm work so the younger mem
bers of the families may have proper
food and clothing while attending
school. Our state educational system
should take care of these boys and
girls, who are following the hard path
of duty, helping with the house or
farm work rather than continuing in
school.
"If conditions are such that they can
not attend high school they should
take advantage of the opportunities of
fered by the University of Washington
and Washington State College for cor
respondence courses, which will give
them a fairly broad education at home.
The state and federal departmental bul
letins are of great value for home
study. lam writing a personal letter
to each of these boys and girls who
stay at home, advisiug them about ad
vanced education and, within a few
weeks, I shall publish a bulletin giving
a list of the means they may take to
obtain such an education, even tho it
is impossible to attend high school or
college."
Seventy-eight per cent of the Chelan
county eighth grade graduates have
continued their education in the high
school. This is the highest percent
age of the five counties from which
statistics have been compiled at this
time.
Farming claims most of the gradu
ates who neither continue in school or
are employed at home. Five are en
gaged in that work. One is employed
as a domestic servant, one in a factory
and one as a laborer. Two have
moved from the slate and no record
has yet been turned in for 16.
This survey will not only enable the
department of education to reach the
boyi and girsl who drop out of school
after completing grammar school, but
the statistics as to the occupations en
teren by them will make possible or
ganization of vocational training of
most benefit to the largest number of
students.
W.V.&N.Ry.Wank Right of Way
Over Streets
In a communication to the city coun
cil the Wenatchee Valley & Northern
Railroad Co. asked for a right of way
over streets. The company wants to
change its line and follow the bank of
the river from the point where it now
crosses the stream near the west end of
River Front street to the mill pond. It
asks for a right of way across Commer
cial street. The railroad is now a pri
rate corporation, having recently abated
its charter as a common carrier.

North Side Road Open
Road Overseer Charley Fox was in
town one day this week and said he
had a crew of men working on the
north side Peshastin road Monday and
Tuesday and got the road in good
shape for travel, and that autos had
since been coming from the lower val
ley by that route. He also said that as
soon as the water in Chumstick creek
receded, which would only be a few
days, work on that road would begin
snd the bridges and washouts repaired.
By the last of this week, or not later
than the first of next week nearly all
the roads leading into Leavenworth
would be in shape for travel by wagons
and autos.
Closed Out at Blewett and Gone
to Alaska
F. Leroy Thermond, who has been
operating mining property at Blewett
for the past few years, closed a deal
last Saturday with H. B. Ridgley for
himself and his associates whereby he
transferred his interest in the Golden
Eagle property at Blewett. Mr Ridg
ley intends, we are told, to develop
the Golden Eagle property in connec
tion with the Meteor property, which
he controls, and which has been reor
ganized under a new name and owner
ship. It is also the purpose of Mr.
Ridgley and his associates to absorb
the conflicting interests in a large
group of adjoining claims and the
coming summer do considerable work.
Mr. Thurmons was connected with
and operated the Golden Eagle prop
erty about two years and took out con
siderable ore, much of which contained
valuable ore and always paid a profit
above the cost of operation. He says
he will shortly leave for Alaska where
he intends to engage in mining. He
spent several years there when the
country lacked transportation, but now
that the transportation problem is about
to be settled by the building of a gov
ernment railroad he believes Alaska is
entering on a period of development
that will last for years and offers oppor
tunities for the mining man of exper
ience. '
Clean-Up Week, April 17-22
At the regular meeting Tuesday
night the council designated the week
ending with Saturday, April 22, as
clean-up week. The past has been a
long, dreary winter and there was an
unusual accumulation of rubbish of one
kind and another, much of it a menace
to health and all of it unsightly. Now
let every householder take the admoni
tion to clean up seriously and earnestly
to heart. Trim up the trees and shrub
bery, rake the tin cans, rags and all
other refuse and rubbish in heaps and
have it hauled out to the city's dump
ing ground. A clean town is an attrac
tive town. If the disease-breeding
refuse is cleaned up it will promote the
general health. Every advantage is on
the side of cleaning up. Let it not be
told in Gath that there is a slacker in
this respect.
Every householder must clean up
between his lot line and the center of
the alley, and the strreet from his lot
lot line to the center of the street and
have the rubbish hauled to the dump
ing ground. Those failing to do so
will be prosecuted under the ordinance
providing a penalty for maintaning a
nuisance. 15*

$3,000 WILL BE SPENT
BY THE GRtAT NORTHERN
Between Leavenworth and Puget Sound
Coning Summer—Snow Sheds, Re
laying Steel and Sidings
According to reports given the press
the past week the Great Northern rail
way will spend a huge amount of
money the coming summer in better
terments. Snow sheds in the Cascades
at the points where the past wider
made it evident they were needed,
will come in for the largest amount,
which is estimated at upwards of two
million dollars. Twenty-three miles of
track between Leavenworth and We
natchee is to be replaced with 120
pound steel. The company is now en
gaged in laying heavy rails between
Lowel and Monroe, west of the Cas
cades.
Because tonnage patronage is in
creasing so rapidly with the Great
Northern the company is increasing
the carjacity of its storage yards in
Delta. This contracts, said to be of a
"rush" nature, owing to the exigen
cies of the case, means the laying of
12,000 feet of additional trackage in
four tracks, each 3,000 feet in length.
Work is progressing on the laying of
an extra six miles of storage tracks at
the Gold Bar terminal, and this point
is expected to be used for terminal
purposes next month.
The work contemplated and under
progress involves wholesale repairs to
the big tunnel thru the mountain sum
mit, the construction of four long ad
ditional tracks in the Delta yards, the
completion of the tunnel lining under
Everett, relaying steel rails, the com
pletion of increased facilities for the
Gold Bar terminal and the building of
snowsheds.
Here and there thru the long bore
inconsiderable damage has resu'ted the
past winter owing to the earth's action,
and unless repaired at this time the
damage might grow to dangerous pro
portions. Grant Smith & Co., have
also been awarded a contract by the
Great Northern to place 10,000,000
feet of timbers for snowsheds, while
Henry McPhee, of Seattle, is given the
work of constructing combination rear
walls. It is said 1,500 men will be
employed on these three jobs in the
Cascades this summer.
The snow shed work will begin a
half mile west of Leavenworth near
where four men were killed in Febru
ary, and every place protected with
sheds where the past winter the slides
indicated they were necessary to pro
tect the operation of trains. A num
ber of new sheds will be constructed
between Leavenworth and Chiwaukum,
and at a number of other points be
tween here and the summit.
County Road Repairing
Road Supervisor Tom Parrish drove
up in his car Monday from Cashmere
and informed The Echo that while
vehicles could get over the north side
rosd at the present writing, the travel
ing conditions were by no means first
class. He has two crews at work im
proving this route between here and
Peshastin, but the clay formation makes
progress slow and difficult while the
ground contains such a great quancity
of water. Two crews are also busy on
bridge work and road filling near the
Tom Heury ranch at Dryden.
If the clear, warm and windy weather
continues until next Monday a number
of men will be employed on the Chum
stick where eight bridges have been
destroyed and the road in several places
washed out. Just now the creek is
overflowed to such an extent that repair
work is impracticable. It is hoped
that within ten days tnis route will be
in (air shape for travel.
The southside road to Peshastin will
not be open for ten days or possibly
longer.

COUNCIL PROCEEDINGS
There was a regular meeting of the
city council Tuesday evening. Four
members, Featherstone, Hale, Kugel
man and Snyder, with Mayor Day and
City Attorney Nelson, were in attend
ance.
Bills totalling $59.00 were allowed
and ordered paid.
The refusal by the State Bank to
casi the 8500 warrant drawn in favor
of W. F. Whitney, attorney in pro
posed suit against Seaman & Quigg,
was the first matter brought to the at
tention of the council and its discus
sion occupied the better part of the
evening. It was finally decided that
the proper solution of the matter was
to issue a warrant on the current ex
pense fund to take up the $500 water
warrant. The current expense fund
will be reimbursed whenever there is
sufficient money in the water fund to
do so.
An ordinance granting additional use
of streets by the Wenatchee Valley
& Northern Railway Co., was given its
first reading.
P. H. Graham was appointed police
judge by the mayor and council ap
proved the appointment. The office
now carries a salary of $25 per month.
On motion committee of three was
appointed to confer with the bank in
regard to the city's finances —Hale,
Kueelman and Snyder. Treasurer
Woodrow will act in conjunction with
the committee.
Next week, April 17 to 22, was des
ignated as "Clean-up Week" and all
persons are instructed to clean up their
yards, and all garbage in and around
their premises, and have the stuff taken
to the garbage dump.
Street Commissioner Tolbert was in
structed to hire a man to clean up
and take care of the garbage grounds.
This wound up the business of the
evening and council adjourned.

WANTS UNITED STATES
TROOPS OUT Of MEXICO
Yesterday's News Dispatches Indicate an
Early Rupture With the U. S. A.
That bewhiskered old poppingdoodle
who has vainly been trying to pacify
Mexico for the last two years, notified
your Uncle Samuel yesterday that he
wanted him to get his troops out of
Mexico. Of course he wont go until
he gets good and ready, and the clash
that will embroil us in war with Mexico
is not far off.
It now looks as if the story about
the death of Villa was inspired by Ca
ranza sympathisers as a ruse to get U.
S. troops out of the country. Caranza
says if Villa is still alive his troops are
able to cope with him. What coping
has been done so far was done by good
American troopers, wherefore the
Washington government has little faith
in Caranza's blustering promises.

HON. A. J. WILSON Of
SPOKANE fOR CONGRESS
A Hard-Headed, Successful Business Man
With a Constructive Repub
lican Policy
Mr. Wilson, who has made his home
in Spokane for years, is one of the suc
cessful business men of the Falls City
and a lifelong republican. His con
nection with the lumbering business —
the chief industry of the state —should
be an asset in his candidacy, as upon
statewide prosperity in the lumbering
industry hinges our prosperity. He is
a thoro believer in the republican poli
cy of protection for American industry,
and believes the tariff is responsible
for the differei.ce in workingmen's
wages here and in Europe. He is in
favor of a strictly non-partisan tariff
commission composed of men who
thoroly understand the conditions in
this country as well as the conditions
in foreign countries relative to labor
and manufacturing. Ooe of his plain
and to the point statements is as follows:
"If elected a member of congress
from this district it shall be my highest
ambition to assist in restoring pros
perity, security and contentment to the
people of the nation and the state, thru
protection to American industries, and
to foster the fullest preparedness against
the disasters of invasion, either military
or commercial."
"I trust the voters of these eight
counties realize, as I do, that in order
to elect any republican to congress
from this district, all past factional dif
ferences must be healed, and all mem
bers of party, mindful of its tri
umps and its achievements during the
past fifty years, become completely re
united and welded into one harmonious
whole. Any other course means a con
tinuation of democratic rule and busi
ness depression.
