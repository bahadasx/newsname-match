Petrograd. The successful camnalen
of the Russians against the Turks In
Asia Minor has been carried out under
frightful weather conditions.
Some of the hardships suffered by
the soldiers may be understood from
the following narrative by an officer
of the descent of his men from the
snowclad peaks before Koprlkeui:
we held a position on the summit
of Mount , which rises nearly
eleven thousand feet above sea level.
Every morning there was a strong
wind, which drove before It masses of
snow, and drifted up our positions to
a depth of from ten to fifteen feet.
Our shelters, huts and kitchens were
all buried in snow. The wind was so
fierce that most of our huts were al
most blown to pieces, though they
were held together by wire.
"This blizzard lasted for davs. for
weeks, and it was Impossible to keep
the huts clear. If you shifted one
spadeful of snow, as likely as not the
wind would fling into its place two or
three times the quantity. For whole
