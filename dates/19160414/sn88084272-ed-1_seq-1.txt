Says Chicago Bankers In
clined to Shut Out His
Institution.
Chicago, 111, April 14 William Lor
Inier, resuming the stand today in his
ttial on a charge of conspiracy in
connection with the failure of the 1
Salle Street Trust & Savings bank,
denied testimony given previouslv by
James B Forgan, president of the First
National bank and head of the clear
ing house. Regarding testimony by
Mr Forgan that he had told Mr Lori
mer that the bank was going from
bad to worse. Mr. Lorimer said he did
not bolieve Mr. Forgan had told him
that.
Mr Lorimer told of calling upon a
number of big bankers for aid in se
curing clearance and of being refused.
'Wanted o More Competition.
"All of this." he said, "and the fact
that the newspapers contained the
story almost Immediately following
Mr Forgan's telling Mr. Munday our
bank would not be taken into the
clearing house association, led me to
believe that the bankers of Chicago
didn't want anyone here who was lia
ble to build up a large bank, but they
were willing to take our customers.
"The printing of the newspaper story
about the clearing house's action
caused a run on the bank, $1, 000,00k
bting withdrawn, but we were able to
weather the storm."
Tells of llorronlnc $JO,00.
Regarding the denationalization of
the bank, the witness said there was
no Idea at any time of escaping from
the supervision of the national bank
examiner. The actual denationalisa
tion, he said, was arranged by others.
"All I did," continued the witness,
"was to sign a note for Jl. 550,000. I
then went to Mr. Dawes and told him
We needed 1,260,000 and asked If he
would cash a check for that amount. He
siu yw anu urn so inere was no se
cret aa to what was being1 done."
Mr. Lorimer told of losing interest in
the bank and was preparing to with
draw. Mr. Munaay opposed this, he

"At no time." said the witness, "did I
think there was anything wrorfe I
thought the bank was very , well man
aged and that Mr Munday was a very
efficient man I did not begin to take
an active interest until about the mid

Gomez was reported to be moving, or
about to move, his army, variously esti

the Sonora-Chihuahua line into Chi

possible menace to the Casas Grandes

communication.
The censorship at Columbus Is be
lieved to have precluded the possi
bility of mentioning this phase of the
airmen's flight The fact that they
flew over a portion of the Sierra
Madres and returned quickly might be
taken as indicating either that they
found no evidences of a troop move
ment, or that, having found a troop
movement under was, they hastened
back to Columbus to report.

I- April 7 (by courier to Columbus,
A N. M, April 14.) About 30 men
of the Tenth cavalr, negro, who were
in the fight with Villistas April 1 at
Aguascalientea, arrived here today for
rest and reoutfitting.
The men were sure thev had killed
more than the three dead covered in
the official report. Three times the
Villistas, numbering about 150, at
tempted to ambush the advance guards
of the Tenth. The Mexicans fought
with considerable military strategy.
Not more than three troops of the
Tenth participated in the fight, which
lasted an hour and a half.
The Tenth was riding for Guerrero
when It approached the town of Aguas
callentes. One of their guides warned
them that a considerable body of
mounted troops must hae passed along
the road ahead of them. The horse
tracks were still fresh. The advance
guard of the Tenth went forward cau
tiously as they approached the town,
which was hidden behind a hill. Near
ing the top of the rise, the advance was
without warning subjected to volley
fire, coming simultaneously from both
sides of the road. The Villistas shoot
ing' at them were behind hills on
either aide. Troop E of the Tenth was
brought up at a trot, while F troop
went around to flank the Villistas and
drive them out of the MIL Troop II
was hurried forward.
As B troop rounded tne mil at a gal

the Villistas oa that side. Some of

one of the returning men toda. "and
they knew the trails, while we did not,
but we went up after them We went

were whistling all around us. but they
never hit one of us They had a ma
chine gun in action, too We could
hear its pop-pop-pop, but we could not
see it- We dismounted and returned
the fire. Then they ran farther up the
mountain, with us after them, until
they made another stand We opened
fire on them again, but they would
not stand. At Iat they got
away in the steep trails, which they
knew, while we climbed rocks and
fallen tree trunks and fell behind. They
did not try to fight again."

These entrenchments are being care

Signal I'lres.
American scouts are also being sent
to the Dos Cabazos and OJitos passes
leading from Sonora Into Chihuahua to
report the presence of any Carranza or
other soldiers from the western side of
the pass. Signal fires, which have been
seen on the mountains near Colonia
Dublan for the past week hive at

camp.
The Americans were told at Colonia

firing only a few rounds. It poured
these into a cabin wounding a Vililsta

fire was used by the Americans, as it
was considered a waste of ammunition
because of lack of targets.
Capture llurro With CJoffee.
Among the Villistas killed was a sol
dier who tarried too long while tring
to take his burro off with him. The
reason for his eagerness to save the
burro was apparent when the Ameri
cans got to his body. The burro stood
beside him, loaded with what the cav
alrymen in this campaign have dubbed
"gold," namel, coffee. Most of the
soldiers regartled this capture as of
more importance than the Vililsta pris

This view of the t luun n was oiced
to4M? by senator atone, i halt-man at
th foreign relations committee. It
watt regarded as unusually significant,
since senator Stone is usually regarded
as voicing the views of the administra
tion in foreign affairs. He is, there
fore, accustomed to be cautions, in bis
utterances.
After conferring with secretary of
state Lansing toda, chairman Stout,
said:
The problem confronting this gov -ernmeat
is how long it would be wite
to keep an expeditionary force In Mex
ico. 1 have never believed that t
would achieve the capture of Villa
Diaz had a price on Vila's head for
i ears and could not get him. I do not
doubt that Carri-nta woajM like to get
him, but he has been nnasble to do so.
He Has the Rest of It.
Villa kiln his own country, and our
soldiers af in ft difficult, unknown
country. They Bate succeeded in
breaking np some of Villa's bands and
have accomplished something. I was
strongly in favor of sending the expe
dition after Villa, whether it got him or
not.
"But we have recognized the de facto
government in Mexico and agreed to
send an expeditionary force into Mex
ico for a certain purpose. How long
can we let that army stay in a foreign
tountrv where friction already exists
and where more friction is bound to
deielop? If we adhere to our policy
toward Mexico, we cannot keep the
army there. To my mind the only al
ternative to withdrawing the troops
sooner or later is intervention."
"Kill or Capture A Ilia."
Representative McJLemore. of Texas,
whose resolution to warn Americans
off belligerent ships raised one of the
liveliest rows of the present congress,
introduced today a resolution that "the
American militarv forces must not for
an reason be withdrawn from Mexico
until Francisco Villa has been killed,
captured or forced into exile."
The resolution was referred to the
foreign affairs committee.
