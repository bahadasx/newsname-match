now is the time for the "look

are the recognized standard of
styles. They apply to your
gowns, dresses, hats, shoes and
the great miscellany of apparel
incidentals. For confirmation
of these facts, read the mer
chants' a d v e r t i s i n g in The
Times-Dispatch this morning.
You will agree with us, that
"looking you<" best" is in.I a
suggestion of extravagance,
but an opportunity for good ap

any parallel in quality at.d
economy of price.

the Sussex and the attack upon a

Complete reports rewarding the losses
to the Amerieau troops or the Mexicans
had not reached Wellington to-night.
Secretary Baker advised President Wil
I son that a brief messuue to the War
Department advised that, according to
unoilicial messages, one cavalryman
was killed. and that, the troopers used
the nrtttfTiTno guns against the Mexi
ea n 3.
Secretary Raker said lie had ordered
I General Kutiston t<> take any steps
| necessary to prevent further trouble.
| Asked whether this might mean the
[enforced use of Mexican railways for
the movement of soldiers and supplies,
he said General I-'unston was on the
ground, and would act as any emer
gency required. The secretary ex
pressed the hope, however, that the
trouble at I'arral was purcl.v local, and
dt?l not presage further dilliculties.
tSeneral t'arranza, directing liis em
bassy here to point out th.it the clash
pioved his contention that the pres
ence of American troops in Mexico is
leading to a situation which threaten**
to ro beyond his control, telegraphed
that "many deaths had occurred on
both sides."
l-'oreign .Minister Aguilat. in a dis
patch sent before that from tSeneral
Carranza. said one Amerieau trooper
was killed and several civilians
w ounded.

Consul Garcia. Carrnnr.ii agent at Kl
I'aso. wired the embassy that "several
persons were. killed on both sides."
The dispatch added that when the
American troopers entered l'arral "Iho
people protested, anrl it appears (ho
garrison ? 11ci also."
This latter statement is in direct con
tradiction to the dispa tches of Car
ranza and Abuliar. which declared the
Carta n/.a troops attempted to hold back
> lie Mexican mob. A report to the
State I >ep.i it men t from Consul Letcher,
at Chihuahua, forwarded through Gun
eral Kunston. said there had been some
"trouble" at l'arral when the American
column was tired upon by Mexican
civ ilians.
The State and War Departments, re
ceiving: from tlie Mexican embassy
their first information that the clash
had been serious, at one sent out
orders for a full report. It had not
been received to-night.
L'pon President Wilson rests the de
cision of what effect the attack on the
administration's Mexican policy shall
be, whether it will have a bearing on
consideration of Carranza's proposal
for withdrawal of the troops and,
finally, whether Carranza's proposal
shall l>e accepted, rejected or negoti
ated. Members <<f his oflleial family
indicated to-night that it practically
was certain no Immediate order for
withdrawal of the expedition seeking
Villa would be given. The subject will
be laid before the Cabinet to-morrow.
I5ecause of the serious turn in t;>e
Mexican situation and the gravity of
the submarine issue with Germany, the
President canceled an engagement to
go to New York to-morrow nii?ht and
speak there on Saturday night.

Congress will not have an opportun
ity to show its feeling until it meets
to-tnorrow, news of the attack on
American troops having not reached
the Capitol until the Senate and House
had adjourned.
Carranza's proposal for the with
drawal of the expedition, however,
meets the general sentiment that the
administration should be left f re- to
handle the situation for the presenr.
To-night the situation of the isolated
detachment is the cause of soma
