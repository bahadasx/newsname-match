Toklo, March 1 S. Conditions In
Formosa have come up for discussion
recently at committee meetings in
the Japanese dlt. and there is evi
dence that the situation is giving the
authorities some nnxlcty. Since Japan

of the Island hate been administered
by a governor-general who has had
wide latitude In legislative power.
The advisability of withdrawing some
of this power Is one of the questions
now under discussion.
Dr. Ichiki, the home minister, ad
mitted that although the recent resig
nation of Mr. 1'chidu, the civil gov
ernor and other was due to Illness,
they would have been compelled to
resign on account of the recent riot

"In this connection the Mexican
government warned the government
of the Cnited States from the begin
ning it would be unwise for American
troops to go through cities due to the
Impossibility to avoid friction between
them and the people and our forces
at an unexpected moment. The Amer
ican government, to that effect,
agreed to give the necessary Instruc

stain from occupying any towns. The
Mexican government deplores the oc
currence, but it was beyond Its efforts
to prevent it and Insists with th.(
American government on tho neces

the alteration of the good and cor
