A Rousing Convention
SHINGLE WEAVERS'
CONVENTION
(Headquarters of the International
Shingle Weavers' Union of Amer
ica, 202 Maynard Building.)
Seattle, Wash., April 9, 1916.
To the Officers and Members of Local it
Unions —Greeting: J
The convention, which adjourned
sine die last Wednesday noon, was '
one of the argest, most enthusiastic, 1
constructive and successful in the !
history of the organization. A new ;
international constitution and a new
wage scale for District No. 1 were
adopted. The constitution is now in
effect and the wage scale will become 1
effective May 1, 1916. The 1914 wage
scale was adopted, except with the 1
following changes: The knotsawyers'
day wage of $3.50 was increased to
$4.00; the minimum wage for packers
was raised from B%c per M to 9c;
packers shall receive one cent addi
tional for nailing bands and one cent
additional for tallying. Thanksgiving
and election day are no longer termed
holidays by this organization.
The convention proceedings, new
constitution and new wage scale will
be printed and distributed among the
membership at the earliest possible
date. The new constitution follows
along the general lines of the timber
workers' constitution now in the
hands of the membership; only such
changes being made as were neces
sary to conform with the requirements
of this organization. However, there
were several new departures taken,
to-wit: Withholding power from the
international president to call strikes;
vesting in the international executive
board alone the power to call strkes;
making it illegal for local unions to j
call a strike for any cause till the in
ternational executive board has ap
proved same; prohibiting the interna-[
tional union from expending any of
its funds to finance illegal strikes.
All delegates reported good prog-
KM in the reorganization campaigns
being prosecuted in their respective j
jurisdictions, while this office is
dally in receipt of numerous reports
from various parts of the Pacific
Northwest indicating that keen inter
est in organization affairs is being
shown everywhere.
Adequate shipping facilities are I
now at the command of the shingle
mill companies. During the past ten
days many more orders for shingle
weavers have been received and filled
by writer. The demand for shingle
weavers is now so great that a certain
manufacturer of Ballard, Wash., was
Thursday compelled to appeal to this
office for part of a crew. This is sig
nificant from the fact that this com
pany heretofore has been notoriously
opposed to this organization. A new '
law of the international employment
office is that no shingle mill employe
shall be sent to a position without
first having a paid up working card.
This law will be rigidly and impar
tially enforced under all circum
stances, i
The convention voted to publish our
official organ, "The Shingle Weaver,"
jointly with the Seattle Union Record, i
the official organ of organized labor
of Seattle and vicinity, having at
present a weekly circulation of more
than 8,000, the largest of any labor j
paper published on the Pacific Coast.
The last page of the Union Record will
be reserved for the publication of
all articles of direct interest to the ■
members of this organization, such
as official notices, editorials, news
matter, local correspondence, etc. '
Prior to the first Issue a new mailing
lis! must be formulated.
Hogging your co-operation in the re
building of our organization and an
ticipating its phenomenal growth, I
beg to remain, with best wishes,
Fraternally yours,
WM H. REID,
In ternational Secretary-Treasurer.
SPRINGFIELD, Mass.—The Fiske
Rubber Company has discharged a
score of men on the ground that "a
curtailment of work" made this neces
sary. The machinists' union Is not
satisfied with the explanation, as Die
shop committee and active unionists
are the ones laid off. It was unani
mously voted to strike If these work
ers are not reinstated. About 100
men arc Involved.
Strikers Acquitted
(From the Committee on Industrial
Relations, Washington, D. C.)
Washington. — "Governor Carlson
[and Attorney General Farrar of Colo
rado are utterly discredited and their
persecution of former strikers and
union officials has definitely failed as
a result of the verdict just returned
by a Colorado jury acquitting four
former strikers accused of murder."
This is the substance of a statement
today by Frank P. Walsh, chairman of
the Committee on Industrial Rela
tions.
"Carlson and Farrar were elected
on a "law and order" platform, pledg
ing them to execute coal company
vengeance on the strikers," said Mr.
Walsh. "They succeeded in procur
ing the conviction of John R. Lawson
and his sentence to life imprisonment
before the Supreme court spoiled
their plans by disqualifying the hand
picked judge whom Carlson put in
office at the bidding of the coal com
panies.
"The verdict at Castle Rock shows
that these corporation agents had
nothing left to stand on when they
were forced to submit their case to a
fair judge. They have been frus
trated at last In their hitherto suc
cessful effort to pervert the course of
justice.
"Even the newspapers most friend
ly to the coal companies are now de
manding that further prosecution
cease, and it is apparent that the
people of Colorado are no longer de
' ceived as to who are the real masters
of the men they put In office In the
belief that they Were supporting the
prohibition cause.
"Credit for the magnificent de
j fense received by the four strikers
just acquitted is due to Edward P.
jcostigan, their attorney. A fair
j judge permitted the defense to put
into the record the amazing story of
crime and tyranny in the coal fields
of southern Colorado, and the result
' could not have been in doubt.
"This ends the attempt of the coal
companies |tjo put terror into the
■ hearts Ipf amy group of employees
who might at some time In the future
[dare to revolt against industrial tyran.
! ny. They hoped to accomplish this
by procuring, through Carlson and
Farrar, the imprisonment or hanging
|of many of the strike-heroes of
1913-14."
COLORADO LAW DISCUSSED
Chicago.—lv the March 21 issue of
t the Tailor, official magazine of the
International Journeymen Tailors'
Union. Organizer Biggs of that organ
ization, charges Chairman McLaugh
lin of the Colorado state industrial
j commission with attempting to have
i Denver journeymen tailors accept the
.non-union shop.
Under the Colorado law workers
cannot strike until they give thirty
days' notice to the commission. After
I the tailors gave this notice it was
several months before the commissio"
indorsed their demands, which were
later accepted by many of the larger
em ployers.
j The tailors have been conducting a
spirited agitation against the law,
and even though they have secured:
I better working conditions they give
'credit to no one but their organization.
In recounting the forces that con
fronted them, Organizer Biggs writes:
' "Recently the chairman (of the
commission) had been around to some
of our shops interviewing the mem
bers of our unions, and asked them,
'which would you rather have, recogni
tion of the union or more money?'
| "That was an attempt to undermine
the loyalty of our members. When
men in legislative halls are offered
money to vote against their principles
it is called bribery. Mclaughlin,
chairman of the commission, Is for
the non-unionl shop. We told him
that to his face. Also that he himself
did not respect the law he had sworn
to honestly administer. This bosses'
man tried several times to get us to
submit the union shop to arbitration.
We always declined. We know now
what would have happened if we had
been so foolish as to trust so sacred
| a thing in his hands."
The Labor Journal
REPORT OF THE EXECUTIVE
BOARD OF THE CHICAGO
FEDERATION OF LABOR ON
"PREPAREDNESS."
(Adopted Sunday, February 6, 1916.)
If we are to express the attitude
of the labor movement toward the
increase of military power, we must
face the issue squarely and consider
all questions concerned in relation to
the workers. We must draw the line
between "Preparedness," as it might
be defined by labor, and the militar
ism which is the real desire of the
commercial interests. ,
The program advocated by "Big
Business" and the newspapers which
it controls should be unqualifiedly op
posed by organized labor. The kind
of preparedness in which we believe
would not result in the destruction,
but in the protection of human life
and the products of labor. Our pre
paredness would mean the develop
ment of every man, woman and child
to the highest possible standard.
Furthermore it would develop the
only true patriotism. A government
which would give equal opportunity
and justice to all would possess, in
the highest degree, the love and loyal
ty of its citizens. The father who
could look forward with courage and
fortitude, the mother who could go
about her daily tasks in peace and
confidence in the future, the children
assured of opportunity, would love
their country and protect it. Such
people would have too high a sense
of justice to attack, wantonly, any
other people.
Throughout all the countries of the
world today there is a struggle for
the control of industrial organization.
Upon one side are the great commer
cial interests, upon the other side the
great organizations of labor. A study
Of the political governments of our
day Will prove that they are dominat
ed by tllo powerful business organiz
ations. Their" problems are the prob
lems of trade . For the protection of
privileges, the development of colo
nies, spheres of influence and com
mercial supremacy armies and navies
are created and supported.
,In the Chicago Herald, December 29,
William L. Chenery writes that at the
Clark University conference on war
this month Rear Admiral Chadwick,
U. S. N., said:
"Imperialism has had its worst and
most injurious development in recent
years, its essence being land-grabbing
and the establishment of spheres of
infuence. Navies and armies are the
insurance for capital owned abroad by
the leisure class of a nation. It is
for them that empires and spheres of
influence exist. The great war now
raging is a culmination of efforts to
maintain and extend these spheres.
The time has come to call a halt."
,Any plan for heavy armament, under
present conditions, will mean the
spending of billions, the building up
of great ammunition trusts and other
trusts which take their life out of the
labor of the workers. It will mean
the development of an oligarchy of
powerfu commercial forces which
would dominate the government and
crush out forever the hope of dem
ocracy. The stronger the military
power would become, the stronger

would become the power of the com
mercial interests. Not only would
they dominate the social and political
life of the country but they would
control the educational policy, teach
their philosophy in the schools, subsi
dize the newspapers and all sources
of information. Their power to do
these things today is nothing to what
it would be if a great army and
navy backed them up.
But this is not the only danger.

importance in a modern war. Every

power includes a plan for industrial
Furthermore, every
plan looks toward some form of coer
cion, not only military conscription,
but industrial conscription, which
would bring the workers of the na

would be. silly. The schools should
do all possible to develop keen, ready
minds and heathy bodies. The CO- 1
operative instinct which would result ;
in willing obedience for the best in- I

which should inspire this training. 11
8. Organzed labor should strive to |
obtain the fullest possible recognition
by the government for organizations I
of working people instituted for the i
working conditions. i 1
We recommend that organized labor '
be alive and awake to see that inj'
any system of citizen soldiery, the j 1
greatest possible freedom and dem- 1
ocracy shall prevail; that the men
shall be given education in civic
affairs, physical training and the
fullest opportunity for promotion from
the ranks. Representation for labor
upon whatever committees or com
missions may be chosen to decide
upon or control plans for military <'
defense should be demanded.
9. Any military system should be ,
democratically officered and con- ,
trolled by heads directly responsible j
to the citizens of the land.
10. We should oppose any increase ;
of the standing army. The danger to 1 :
the American working man from for- J
eign countries is not so much to be, I
fearedfeared as the danger of
an attack by their govern
ments. The real danger to the work-J
ers comes from the hordes of help-,
j less, underfed foreign immigrants
(Which are brought into this country'
every year by the great manufactur
j ing interests which want cheap labor.
[Any plan for the. increase of the army
and navy would make this danger '
, more acute. If the American worker*'
are drawn into the army and navy
and the industrial plants which would
be necessary to its support, a demand
for more labor power would make an
| excuse for bringing in low-paid work-,
iers who would undermine the statul
! ard of !!*'itig and make every real
i problem of labor' more acute. The

' cal fitness. Patriotism is needed, but i

In the darkest hour through which I

is doubtful, this at least is certain:

F. W Robertson
Albany, N. V. —A state constabu-
I lary bill has been introducedl in the
i state legislature. Provision is made
for the establishment of four troops
of these cossacks, each containing 45
privates at a salary of $900 per year;
| a captain at $1,800, a lieutenant at
$1,500; a first sergeant at $1,200;
j four sergeants at $1,000 each, and
four corporals at $950 each. These .
shall be in command of a superin
tendent, appointed by the governor,
at an annual salary of of $5,000. The
I bill appropriates $500,000 to establish
! this system, which is now in vogue
iin Pennsylvania.
A state constabulary, its advocates
! say, will relieve the state militia from
strike duty and thereby increase en
listment in the state troops.
At a hearing on the bill representa
tives of organized labor protested the
measure, which was approved by 1
many business organizations. Presi-
I dent Holland of the state federation of
! labor assailed practically every fea
ture of the bill, especially the provis
ions permitting members of the pro
posed constabulary force to make ar
| rest without warrant and to arrest
for attempts to commit crime. "Who
is to determine whether or not a man
lis attempting to commit a crime?"
he asked. "The word 'attempting' is

was a providential occurrence, for in-

DEATHS IN INDUSTRY SHOWN
■ACRAMENTO, Cal.—The report ot
the state industrial accident commis
sion sounds like a report from one of
the European battle fronts. It is
shown that during 1914 the number
of accidents in industries in this
state was 62,211, of which 678 were
fatal and 1,391 were injuries of a per
manent nature.
"With the exception of Sundays
and holidays, two of California's
workmen may prepare every morn
ing to have some one return them to
their homes for burial." says the re
port. "About twice this number must
make application each day to the
surgecn for the elimination of parts
of their bodies that can no longer
serve them. Not a few die of poison
ous gas and many suffer shocks
which destroy their nervous systems."
IS VALUELESS
As long as the workers are willing
to allow the few to assume propriet
orship of the earth and all it eon
tains, the few will doubtless avail
themselves to the full of the great
opportunity. Whenever the workers
awake to their folly, and determine
to uso the earth In the interests of
the majority, the change can be
made, for they possess the power.

$736.95 FOR FAMILY

WASHINGTON. — A. F. of L. Legis
lative Representative Arthur E. Hol

bor that $736.95 a year will permit a
family of five in the. District of Co

and that these figures do not pro
vide even for a street car ride on

Representative Holder urged the
committee to favor the Nolan bill
which provides for a $3 v day min
imum for government employes. The
unionist presented figures to prove
his point that even $3 a day guaran
tees only a decent living in the na
tion's capital, and he handed the com
mittee the following cost exhibit of

"You will observe that I have ta

plained Mr. Holder. "Receiving but
$736.95 a year, there could be no rid

man's family, no tobacco, no candy,
no books, no Sunday school contribu

stamps, no lodge dues, no movies, and
no doctor's bills—for, of course, on
the substantial diet' purchased for
75 cents a day a family of five would
run no chance of ever getting sick.
Moreover, the family must remain
stationary—no births, no deaths, no
accidents, no medicine, no doctors.
"In regard to the 75 cents a day for
food for a family of five, if there is
a woman In the District of Columbia
who can buy the food lor that family
