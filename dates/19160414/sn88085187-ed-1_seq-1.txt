SAY NOT
GUILTY
Arthur "Monk" Young, former
Tacoma saloonkeeper, charged
with forgery in connection with
the looting of state industriiil In
surance funds, was acquitted by
a jury at lv o'clock this morning.
The jury was out all night,
having been unable to reach a
verdict after 11 hours' delibera
tion yesterday. It reached the
verdicl of not guilty after a short
session this morning, but refused
to discuss the verdict.

ing forged warrants, knowing
that they were fraudulent. The
chief witness against him was
Frank *ff. Stone, confessed forger
of Industrial insurance claims.
When Foreman (1 forge W. Bpill
announced the verdict the former
saloonman said, "1 am satisfied
with the verdict, but it was the
only one 1 had expected." He
shook hands with all the jurors.
It was rumored that the jury's
early vote last niglil slood 111 for
conviction and two for acquittal.
This vote was changed, It was
learned, to a six to six vote just
before the jury retired for the
night.
James O'Brien, attorney for
Young, was highly elated over the
verdict today. "It was till that
they could do on the testimony,"
lie said.
Assistant Attorney General
Wilson would make no comment
on the verdict, but seemed dis
appointed.

PRINCE
SPURS
NEUTER
Acting on instructions of Henry
Prince, his financial backer, who
told him pointedly n few days
ago that If he "didn't make some
kind of a promise to the people
pretty soon he'd never get started
at the final election," C. K. W.
Stoever came out with three
"promises" at two of his meet
ings last night.
Stoever, a former pastor of the
Lutheran church, made the long
awaited declarations with all the
dramatic eloquence that he form
erly utilized in bis pulpit.
He declared he would prosecute
bootleggers, would close every
blind pig in the city, and would
run out of the city the parasites
who are living off the earnings of
fallen women.
Stale "Promises."
Stoever did not say what he
would do with the fallen women.
The "promises" made by the
former minister were the. same as
have been made during the entire
campaign by every candidate who
sought the office of public safety.
Most of the Stoever campaign
material, part of Which was used
by Livingston Wilkeson in B
speech for the candidate at Val
halla hall last night, when he at
tacked the morals of Tacoma
during the former Pettit admin
istration, lias been furnished by
former Police Chief Loomls.
Looiuls is one of the leaders of
the Stoever workers, and is said
to have been promised his posi
tion in the police department if
Stoever is elected.
I.o.ii.iis After Job.
Loomls' figure* purport to
show that there were an enorm
ous number of fallen women in
Tacoma at. the end of the Pettit
administration.
Henry Prince is financial back
er of Stoever, because, ln his own
words, he "would have to give
up the Pacific avenue store if
Pettit were elected and should
abolish dice shaking."
Money in Dice.
Prince Is reported to have told
friends that the dice shaking was
bringing hlm between $50 and
$60 a day business al his cigar
store on the avenue. Livingston
W'ilkeson, who is assisting the
campaign, owns the building in
I which Prince's store is located.
Owen Woods and John F.
Meads, who have been named on
the same ticket with Stoever,
were the only other speakers at
last night's meetings, with the
exception of W. D. Askren, cam
paign manager for Gronen, and
Wllkeson.
