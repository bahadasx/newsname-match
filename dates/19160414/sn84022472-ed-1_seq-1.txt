Unable to find any trace of her hus-j

New ' Tork "concern, "which her hus
band did, - on commission!, before his
disappearance. -
Her husband was' seen purchasing
a railroad ticket at the local depot, v
change . on the shelf at- the .window
and for this reason it is not believed
that , he had gone .very far. He wan
suffering " from a nervous prostration,
shortly before his disappearance.
w Mrs. . Irving recently, wrote a letter
to the parents of Irving who are said
to be wealthy residents of, Richmond,
Va. The letter was returned to Mrs.
Irving and on the envelope was pen
ciled, "Family away on trip."
The police are inclined to believ
that Irving may have gone on the trip
with his parents. He was a member
r.f the B. P. E., and wore an EUe
pin.' 'He also wore a gold ring with a
lion's head design. In the mouth of
the lion was a diamond stud.
