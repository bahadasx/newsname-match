ample time to spend in investigating
tho merits of the different kinds of

CONSUMPTION OF
FOOD RESTRICTED
Limit Use of Butter, Sugar and Other Supplies-British
Novelist Returning
From Internment Camp Sees
Famine Impending
By Wilbur S. Forrest.
(United Press Staff Correspondent.)
London, April 14. The imperial
German government's order to all
German hotel and restaurant keepers,
that they must reduce the size of the
meals they serve, both as to variety
and quantity, will be effective through
out Grmany beginning with breakfast
tomorrow morning.
The bills of faro will be reduced to
the smallest proportions on record
and guests will not be permitted to
eat more than one item from any sin
gle course and not very much of
that. The butter supply, for instance,
now In restricted to 1-8 of a pound
per person per week. Mighty little su
gar Is given. Other food supplies are
held to corresponding proportions.
Germany is racing toward famine
which has ber foreseen since last
summer by those who knew the truth
about the summer harvest, according
to Francis Gribblc, the British novel
ist who has just returned to London
aft'er a year in the German internment
camp at Ruhlehen, hear Berlin.
"There is no avoiding the conclu
sion," said Oribble today, "that the
state of the German people soon will
be much what the state of the Belgian
people now would be but for Ameri
can philanthropists.
"The date at which tho catastrophe
will occur depends upon a good many
uncertain factors; but it cannot be
long delayed.
"The 1315 summer harvest, what
there was of it, was both sown and
reaped while I was behind the barbed
wires at Ruhlehen. There was prac
tically no ralu from the end of March
until the beginning of July.
"The crisis passed. Then came the
lashing thunderstorms to complete the
damage. Those of our custodians who
were cbneerued with agriculture pull
ed long faces and used ugly language.
There was no mistake about it the
German harvest of 1!)15 had failed."
The novelist quoted the Vorwarts,
tho outspoken German Socialist news
paper, to show that the lit 15 harvest
failed not only on account of drought
but because:
1. The ground was not manured,
thu monopolization of railway equip
ment, by the military, preventing
this.
2. Horses and carts wore scarce be
cause of the army needs.
3. Most skilled agriculturists were
away at tho seat of war and old men,
women, children and prisoners could
not do the work.
4. The manufacturers of agricul
. 1 -V

Bult oi vu toox .General rersmng B
.m' V-- v; -1
i - H: . , -iv , j -v
tural implements have turned their en
ergies to the manufacture of .imple
ments of war.
"Famine is inevitable ' whether
poaco comes soon or not. Prices will
be high and the value of German mon
ey has sunk so low that 20 marks will
buy only 5 marks' worth of goods; be
sides, Germany has no great quanti
ties of goods' to, export and pay for
food imports."

Washi:,rto:i, April 14. The cabinet
decided today that there will be no
change in the plans that are ben.,
pursued, in Mexico, meaning that the
troops will remain in Mexico, tempo
rarily at least. .
The lack of Information concerning
tho events which caused tho request
o Carranza for the withdrawal ot the
troops, it is understood, prevented a
decision in regard to the future course
to be followed. What attitude the
president took at the cabinet meeting
is not known.
Chairman Stone of the senate com
mittee on foreign relations, following
a conference with Secretary Lansing,
said v"drawal of the United States
troops or Intervention were the vt-.y
alternatives in Mexico.
Gen. Funston was instructed to for
ward all the facts received from Gen.
Pershing as soon as possible. Sec
retary Baker expressed the hope that
the first reports concerning the fight
ing at Parral were exaggerated and
mat the fight was oniy a local affair.
Funston replied that he had not heard
anything from Pershing but was try
ing to get advices.
Secretary Baker declared that no
orders had been issued except to give
Funston free rein in handling the sit
uation resulting from the fighting at
Parral. Bake;- understood that Mex
ico had no objection to the troops tra
versing towns if they did not occupy
them. Consul Rodgers at Mexico City
may discuss the situation with Carran
za today.
H was indicated that the official
suggestion had been made that the
base of tho American troops be chang
ed from Colttnfbtis to Ojinaga ana that
Funston hud asked for additional
troops.
Consular reports vary as to the
number of Mexicans killed at Parral,

Report Fighting Continues.
By United Press.
San Antonio, Tex., April 14. Anx
iously awaiUng advices from Gen,
Pershing concerning the fighting be
tween American troops and Moxtcam
citizens at Parral, Gen. Funston stat
ed this morning that the Villa chasa
was still on as far as headquarter
were concerned.
Funston had heard nothing official
ly regarding the request of Carrana
for the withdrawal ot the troops and
hart not receivtd the account ot the.
Parral fighting that was forwarded to
Washington by the Carranza authori
ties. '
The latest dispatches ' to Washing
ton from Mexican sources indicated
that tho fighting at Parral was still
in progress, the American soldiers be
ing attacked by a mob ot natives in,
superior numbers. Many were report
ed killed in the second outbreak in,
which tho Americans used a machh f
gun.
It Is feared that unorganized ban
dits may have cut oft the retreat oC
the troops, preventing news ot the at
tack from reaching Gen. Porshing.
Officers at headquarters regard th
outbreak as the result ot hysteria,
among the natives living in a town
which has long been considered a
Villa stronghold, the natives probably.
being ignorant ot national develop
ments. It is admitted in army circles that
the situation is becoming serious but
confidence is expressed that th
American troops will be able to tak
rare "t themselves, '
