Villa Bandits Said to Have Raided
Sierra Mojada in State of
Coahuila?Much Property Destroyed
? Guerilla General
May Have Escaped.
El Paso, Texas, April 12.?A hand
of Villa followers numbering soveval
hundred and possibly: a thousand
have sacked Sierra Mojada, five miles
across the Coahuila line and 80
miles east of Jiminez, destroying
many thousands of dollars worth uf
American property and looting the
town of everything of value.
This news, which may prove to be
of the highest'importance as it is be
uevea possioie villa himself was
among the raiders, was received here
today by the representative of one of
the largest American mining concerns
in Mexico and was accepted by some
as authentic.
The bandits made their attack on
the town on April 5. They came from
Escalon. a junction point on the Mexican
National railway, 60 miles southeast
of Jimir.ez. On their way to
Sierra Mojada they sacked the small
town of Corrilo.
Doubles on Tracks.
The belief that Villa himself may
He directing the bandit operations is
supported by a report received today
from Ojinaga stating that Col. Riojas,
the commander there, had information
that Villa had doubled on his
tracks and was 200 miles southwest
of that town.
Ojinaga is directly across the border
from Presidio, Tex., apd about
ir>u mues north Sierra Mojacja.
Another circumstance that Rives
color to this location of the bandit
chief is the fact that Canuto Reyes at
the head of a large number of men
was reported from Torreon a week
ago to be travelling north in the di;
reetion of Sierra Mojada. It was the
belief at the time in Torreon that
Villa's ally was on his way to join
his chief. If it proves true, Villa har
evaded the American troops who
from reliable sources, to be well
south of Parral and close to the
Durango border.
Far to the East.
Sierra Majarda is 140 miles east
the nearest point at which American
troops are known to be. It is on the
eastern side of a vast desert known
as the Poison Mapimi and south of
another dreary, waterless waste called
Dolso de los Li'panes. Its only
connection with the west is by the
Mexican Northern railway along
which the bandits advanced, burning
bridges, destroying telegraph lines
and tearing up tracks as far as they
were able.
Little credence is giverf reports
here from Oji'naga that Villa plans to
turn north and attempt a raid on
Presidio.
It is believed far more probably
that the bandit, if he is at Sierra Mojada,
has chosen th?t desolate and
almost inaccessible spot for the concentration
of?his forces and those of
Canuto Reyes with the idea of sweep
ing down in force on Torreon after
the American troops are withdrawn
from Mexico.
Numerous repoits from Mexican
sources agree that Villa is convinced
the force of the United States sorn
will he recalled and that he will be
able then to rally all the anti-Carran'/a
faction in northern Mexico to
his standard.

NEW SCHOOL
BUILDING NEEDED
Central Quarters Inadequate?
Every Room Full?Necessity
For More Room and Additional
Teachers.
The Central school building is no
longer adequate for housing the pupils
and there is imperative need for
additional teachers in the school. The
old building has been from time to
time added to and remodelled, bu*?
such a procedure could not give relief
for the present needs. The building
is lacking in ventilation, is constructed
upon lines that will not allow
further changes and could not be
made into an enlarged and sanitary
school building without spending more
than it would be worth to build an
entirely new building.
The trustees and Supt. Davis Jeffries
have gone over the matter from
every possible viewpoint and have
unanimously agreed that the only
feasible plan is the erection of an entirely
new and adequate building upon
some suitable lot located elsewhere in
the city. It is thought that the proceeds
from the sale of the present
building and property a considerable
portion of the necessary funds could
be procured to carry out the new
building plans.
The Central school is the one tha\
should be given most careful consideration.
It is there that the small
i- 1 S * " *
v....utv.i, in Toiy uo|(iniiin|; 01 tneir
school course, come. It will always
be the shelter of a large number of
children( and children of a tender age.
They should have the very best surroundings,
equipment and attention.
The people of Union owe it to themselves
and to their little children to
provide a modern and roomy building
for the first grades.

CHAIN0AN0 ALONE
SENTENCE
r
While the Liles chain gang law doe$
not in any way nullify the existing ordinances
of municipalities, yet they
are not "vested with the power to
pass and enforce an ordinance that
does not provide an alternative fine
or sentence, is the opinion of Attorney
uenerai reepies in a letter addressed
to M. P. Wells. The full text of the
letter follows:
"I am in receipt of your inquiry of
the 4th inst. in which you ask whother
or not the act of the last legisldfc
ture, "approved February 19, 1916, and
entitled 'An act to amend section 81 li
volume II, Criminal Code of 19^2, in
reference to intoxicating liquors,' had
the effect of making all municipal ordinances,
and especially yours, null
and void, prohibiting the sale of whist
key where the penalty of such ordi^
nances of towns and cities is in th#
alternative, allowing a " fine or imprisonment.
You ask further if under
this act any municipal corporate^ has
the power to pass an ordinanop. and
nfcfrce the same against the njte of
whiskey in the limits of the todm or
city, or does it not give the State
courts exclusive jurisdiction. if
a municipal corporation can, .-under
this act, pass a valid ordinance preventing
the sale of whiskey in thd
town or city, by making th? nenalty
imprisonms^ '
pill
corporation, unless otherwise prohibited,
has such power under that general
statutory laws to pass such, ordinances
as are not directly or indirectly
repugnant and in conflict with the
general law. Hence, ordinances which
assume directly or indirectly to permit
acts or occupations, which the
state statute or constitution are, under
the familiar rule for validity of ordinances,
uniformly declared to be null
and void. Additional regulations by
the ordinance does not render it void.
And the rule of construction ut res
magie valeat quam pereat is uniformly
applied by the courts to sustain, as
being consistent with the general laws
and constitution, such wholesome bylaws
enacted to suppress disorderly
conduct, provide for the safety, preserve
the health, promote the prosperity
,and improve the morals,.order,
comfort and conveniences of the municipality.
Accordingly, unless it is
prohibited by some expressed constitutional
or statutory provision by the
great weight of authority, the municipal
corporation may by ordinance
prohibit and punish acts which also
prohibited and punishable as misdemeanors
under the general statutes
of the State.
"in tnis connection, Chief Justice
Melver, in delivering the opinion of
the court in the case of Greenville vs.
Remmis, 58 S. C., 45.1, says: 'Common
experience shows that corporations
find it necessary for the peace
and pood order of the city to forbid
the doing of many acts, under penalty,
as to which the legislature have not
found it necessary to legislate. The
ordinance is certainly not in conflict
with an act of the legislature. The
state legislature upon the subject,
even if construed as contended for by
appellant and the municipal legislation
here in question, can both stand
together and there is no conflict whatever.
The utmost that can be said
is tnat tne municipal corporation, under
the authority vested in it by its
charter, has seen fit to make an act
done within the corporate limits a
criminal offense, which the legislature
has not seen fit to constitute such
an offense. Indeed, it is well settled,
in this State at least, that the same
act may he made an offense against
the State and municipal law."
"This view is also quoted by Associate
Justice Fraser in delivering the
opinion of the court in the case of
City of Columbia vs. Phillips, 101 S.
C., 301. See also McCormick vs. Calhoun.
30 S. C., 93. 8 S. E., 539; State
vs. Williams, 11 S. C., 288; State vs.
Charleston, 12 Rich. 480; State vs. Co.
lumbia, 0 Rich. 404; Schroeder vs.
Charleston, 3 Rrev. 533.
"I do not therefore think it was the
intention of the legislature in the recent
enactment referred to, to deprive
in any way or withdraw from

municipalities the power to enact and
enforce such ordinance as they theretofore
had the power to do, and it is
my opinion that the copy of the ordinance
as submitted to me is not in
any wise in conflict with the laws of
this State.
"But, however, it is my opinion that
a municipal corporation is not vested
with the power to pass and enforce
an ordinance that does not provide an
alternative fine or sentence. My position
in this connection, I feel, is sustained
by the provisions of section
