Tho Convention at Oklahoma City
Resulted In Perfect Harmony, and
Was a Victory for tho Governor.
Lafayette Withdrew From Cuntcst.
At the elope of a bitter campaign
for national committeeman, tho Dem
ocratic State convention at Oklahor
ma Cltjr Tuesday -was hold without
roll call and without argument, Aa
soonaa ft became apparent to Bon N.
Lafayotto, of Chocotah, jthat Tom L.
Wade, of Marlow, had enough voteg
in tho convention to elect him, tho
former withdrew and placed tho Mar
low man in nomination. Thero nov--er
was a test of strength. ThiB was
remarked in the closing hours of the
day by T. Barry King, of Tahlequah,
In asking that a motion that would
havo resulted in a roll call be with
drawn. The result la generally conceded
by Democrats who have followed it
as a great victory for Governor Wil
liams, who sought nothing" for him
self and declined all offers of honors.
He was brought into the campaign
between Wade and Lafayetto, and
when the issue was made he partlcl
pnted In the campaign.
Addresses were made before the
convention by Congressman W. H.
Murray of the Fifth District, who
was elected a delegate at large to
tho national convention, by Governor
Williams, qxj-Governor Cruce, and ex
Governor Donaghoy of Arkansas.
The convention Was called to or
der by Alger Melton, State Chair
man. Preston S. Davis, of Vlnlta,
was made temporary chairman with
out opposition. W. H. Stewart, of
Garfield County, was made ..tempor
ary secretary.
Mr. Melton made a brief talk, dur
ing which' vociferous cheers were giv
en at the mention of Governor Wil
liams, Senator Owen and the election
lawB enacted by the recent session of
tho Legislature.
Out. of respect to 'Judge Henry M.
Furnian,, whoso death occurred Mon
day night, the convention adjourned
until 2 o'clock In the afternoon.
While the. convention was waiting
for Governor Williams to make an
address, Congressman Bill Murray
was called on for a speech, and af
ter the audience became Insistent,
and ,the delegation from Tishomingo
walked to the stage amid applause,
carrying a Bhrapnel shell that was
given to him by General Crozier, the
man of alfalfa fame showed himself
to his admiring- friends. His address
was on preparedness-,' but (t sort of
got on the nerves of his hoarers and
they Became noisy and boisterous.
Therefore, Bill's remarks were cut
short. Mr. Murray told his hearers
a great many things which they al
ready knew, repetition or rehears
ing of which they seemed to think in
great measure superfluous.
Governor WSlllams received an
ovation. He told the delegates that
the great assembly he faced was a
good omen for the Democracy of the
State and Nation; that it meant that
Oklahoma will bo in the Democratic
column for Wilson and his running
mato. "I stand with the Legisla
ture said the Governor, "and with
the election laws that were enacted
by the Legislature." He enumerated
the merits of tho election laws and
told of their similarity to laws In
other States. He sajd. that If the ini
tiative and referendum in Oklahoma
are to be retained, it is necessary
that a registration law be on the stat
utes, that arguments may be sent to
afl the voters of the State on ques
tions to be submitted for approval or
rejection under that law. "I would
be In fayor of the registration law if
for no other reason than the black
counties," said tho Governor, "but I
tako a higher ground than that and
am in fayor if it because It Is right,
even If all the people were white."
Frank Qulnn and J. J. Bell, elec
tion officers who were convicted un
der the Federal laws for enforcing
the former grandfather clause, Were
called to the Stand and presented to
the audience by the Governor amid
much applause. These men were
pardoed by the President some time
ago. -
Ex-Governor Cruce made an ad
dress In his customary, perfunctory,
and eloquent manner, his plea being
for harmony and victory for the
Democratic party. The speech, while
containing nothing particularly new
in tho way of enlightenment of tho
delegates, took on tht shape of a
sort of "get-together" exhortation,
and as such was received favorably.
Charles E. McPherren, of Bryan
County, reported as chairman of tho
committee on credentials, and tho re
port of the committee resulted In the
seating of the regular delegation
from Tulsa County.
A, McCrory, of Stophons County,
reported for tho committee on organ
ization, recommending R. E. Echols,
of Beckham County for permanent
chalrmau, aud George Short, of Mc
Curtain, foe permanent secretary.
A eulogy of. Bon Lafayqtto was de
livered by Georgo Stone, a'n attorney
of Muskogee. Ho recounted tho ser
TOM WADt
vices Of tho Checotah man to tho par
ty during the Territory days and
since statehood. He asked that tho
namo of Mr. Lafayette bo not consid
ered for national committeeman, be
cause 1 tseewed that a majority of
the delegates preferred another -man
for that place.
Lafayetto was called to the stago
amid deafening applause, where ho
nominated Tom L. Wade for the of
fice of .national committeeman. Wade
was elected by acclamation by tho
unanimous voto of the 1,200 dele
gates, nhd when ho came to the stage
and ''gripped hands with Lafayette,
the harmony of tho convention was
so perfect that several momenst wero
taken up with vociferous applause.
Resolutions wero adopted com
mending, Wilson and his administra
tion on all mattors and to voto aa
a Unit on all questions. Internation
al achievements of the Wilson ad
ministration wore pointed to with a
considerable degree of pride, and his
Mexican policy was unqualifiedly en
dorsed.
Tho resolutions endorse tho ship
purchase bill, non-partisan tariff
commission, rural credits, Philippine
Independence, Improvement of tho
Missouri and Mississippi rivers, and
prevention of tho flood damage that
Is annually caused thereby.
The Hastings bill, conferring upon
the Superintendent of the Five Civil
ized Tribes authority now conferred
upon the Commissioner of ndian Af
fairs and Secretary of tho Interior
respecting tho affairs of the Five
Tribes, was endorsed. A declaration
reaffirming tho belief that In this
way the fullest measure of protection
would be afforded incompetent In
dians. The action of the State and
the Federal governments In protect
ing Incompetent Indians was com-

WILL COTTON AREA INCREASE ?
Will tho cotton crop of Bryan
County be Increased this year 7 Wo
have every, reason to believe that it
will. Last year tho cotton crop of
this county, as well as of the other
counties in Oklnhoma, was decreased
23 per cent. In 1914 Bryan County
produced 22,277 bales of cotton,
worth $38 a bale, or a total of $84$,
52G.00. Sho failed on a feed crop,
and before twelve months had pass
ed, sho had bought more feed than
the cotton crop had sold for. The
money for this feed was sent out of
the State, never to return, and every
body grumbled about hard times.
This 23 per cent of the cotton acre
age was put to feed crops, so that

Bryan County raised more feed In
1915 than sho had raised In many
Boasons previous. Tho cotton crop,
while 2,724 bales short of tho crop
of the year before, brought $681,743
which was moro money than the cot
ton raised the preceding year brought
to the county. If all the farmers in
crease their cotton acreage up to
what It was In 1914, the price will
be correspondingly decreased, and
the farmer will bo left In the hole
again. Wp believe tho wiser policy
Is to raise plenty of feed, increase
tho number of tho live stock, and ar
range to make more of your living at
home. Thero 1b no better feed for
all kinds of livo stock than Spanish
peanuts. Tho Arkansas experiment
station produced 1,252 pounds of
pork to the acre of peanuts; West
Texas, 1,023, and Oklahoma 850. If
this pork had sold for G cents It
would have brought respectively
$75.12, $61.38, and $51. This was
hogged out. There is no cotton crop
equal to It. A man can raiso the live
stock and feed; It takes the whole
family to raise tho cotton. There are
four cars of moat shipped to Hugo
each week. Those cars average $2,
500 each. This supplies three coun
ties, one of which Join this county,
and we find that not more than 10
per cent enough live stock are sold
to meet this bill. Cotton must sup
ply tho balance. Missouri, a live
stock State,, sold $52,000,000.00
worth of poultry In 1914. Arkansas,
stock State, sold $52,000,000.00
worth of meat the same yean. Mis
souri is worth more than $2,500.00
per capita; Arkansas Is worth $204.
Which will you raise: live Btock or
cotton? ' N. T. McALISTER,

CONVENTION WAS
ALL FOR HARRIS
Wnltor Voaclr, of Durant, Chosen aa
Chairman of Congressional District
Committee Tho Expected Fight
Wlas Swallowed Up In Harmony.
The exnected fight in tho Third.
Congressional District Republican
Convention which was held In this
city last Wednesday didn't come.
There -wasn't much to be fought over.
tho Harris men having It all their
own way from the start. The Mc
Oraw men made a half-hearted at
tempt at a fight, when a point of or
der was raited after tho presentation
of a resolution endorsing Harris, and
a substitute offered endorsing no one.
The McGraw men called for a voto
on tho decision of tho chairman that
the substitution was out of order and
the chair was sustained. The result
was that the convention endorsed
James H. Harris, of W .snner for na
tional committeeman and instructed
the delegates to the national conven
tion, which meets In Chicago on tho
7th of Juno, to work and vote for
him. The action of this convention
assures Harris' election, as tho two
votes obtained here give him twelvo
out of the twenty votes.
Harris and McGraw wero both ort
hand in the convention halt, but tho
Harris men controlled every sec
iton -of the convention. The tempor
ary officers were all Harris men, as
wero tho permanent officers.
Judge J. G. Ralls, of Atoka, was
elected permanent chairman, S. Bail
ey Spring, of Choctaw County, per
manent secretary, and James W.
Lewis, of Bryan County, assistant
secretary, The first real business of
the convention after the election oC
officers was a motion to adopt a res
olution endorsing JameB H. Harris
for national committeeman and to In
struct the delegates to the national
convention for him. This brought onf
a fight by the j ,fjraw adherents, but
they wero defeased at every turnr tho
final vote on tho resolution being. 129
to 36 for Its adoption.
This ends what Is said to be tho
hottest fight ever waged for national
committeeman in the United States.
Raymond H. Matthews, of Pittsbure
County, and Clark Wasson, of Push
mataha County, were elected as del
egates to the national convention. R.
O. Sumpter, of Atoka County, and
Charles von Welse. of Carter County.
were elected as alternates. They will
go uninstructed save for the direction
to work and vote for Harris, Logan
B. HIghsmlth, of Latimer County,
was elected presidential elector, and
Walter Veach, of Durant, was chosen
chairman of the third Republican
Congressional comlttee. Whiter
Harris, of McAlester, was endorsed
as a candidate for Congress from
this district.
When the convention opened for
the afternoon, the temporary chair
man intrpduced Hon. Chas. E. Mc
Pherren, who made a talk compli
mentary to Durant's educational in
stitutions and then presented the
Southeastern State Normal School's
Ladles Sextette, under the direction
of Miss Vivian Luck, which rendertd
several selections. These numbers
were followed by two readings by
Miss Elizabeth Jordan, of the Presby
terian College.
Music during the day was" furnish
