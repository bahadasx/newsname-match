Prosecuting Attorney Relents
A gallon or case
One Time.
The Wabash railroad refuses
to handly intoxicants under any
circumstances as freight, and
the Wells Fargo Ex. Co., only
on conditions laid down by pros
ecuting attorney McKittrick, so
far as deliveries to consignees in
this 'county are concerned, of
beer or whiskey shipped from
any point m the state.
The prosecuting attorney first
served notice on the Wabash and
the Wells Fargo, that they must
not deliver any intoxicants what
ever to parties to whom it was
shipped, and the Wabash rail
road instructed all its agents in
this county accordingly. The
Wells Fargo did not understand
that it was under any obligation
to obey the instruction, and again
instructed its agents as follows
"With reference to the recent
ruling of the prosecuting at
torney of Chariton County, made
covering the delivery of liquor
shipments;
Mr. McKittrick has modified
this order and we can continue
to make the deliveries under the
following conditions;
On the delivery of each ship
ment you will take the consig
nees written declaration on form
sample enclosed and will require
it to be sworn to before a notary
public whenever a party receives
more than one gallon of whiskey
or one case of beer per week or
one barrel of beer per month
You will keep these declara
tions on file for the inspection of
the prosecuting attorney."
The form which all persons
are required to sign and swear
to in case of the shipment to
them of more than the quanity
of whiskey or beer in a week
permitted by the prosecuting
attorney, is as follows;
I being over the age
of 21 years, hereby declare that
the shipment of contain
ing of is for my own
use; that I will not dispose of
any of it contrary to the law;
that I will not keep, store or
deliver it or any part of it, to or
for any other person; that 1 will
not sell, barter or give away un
lawfully, any part thereof,
either directly or indirectly.
Signed
Subscribed and sworn to before
me this day of 191
It will be seen and understood
by the disclosure above that our
prosecuting attorney has relent
ed and modified his first order
to the public servants. The law
is deficient in respect of pres
cribing the quanity of liquors,
wines and beers any one indi
vidual may get in a given time,
and the prosecuting attorney has
undertaken to supply that defi
ciency. If he has measured the
capacity of others by his own
requirements, he cannot be ac
cused of giving too much lati
tude to the appetite of others
because he is hearty himself.
gallon a week or a case of Bud'
weiser is next to no drinking,
but the saving clause is the
affidavit. Any one wishing a
barrel of liquor or a car of beer,
... is privledged to get it, and that
it requires so much for some
people, none will deny from the
evidence. We publish the orders
, to the express agents for the
' benefit of some of the prosecut
- ing attorney's constituents, that
they may not criticise him
True, if the rule the prosecut
ing attorney has given the rail
road and the express company
is made permanent and adhered
to, there will be no occasion for

L N. Wiseman Dead
Saturday night one of the old
residents west of town, I. N.
Wiseman, died after an illness
of renal and other disease, aged
79 years, 1 month and 18 days.
Mr. Wiseman came to this
county from Kentucky many
years ago and was active in all
the neighborhood affairs until
about two years ago when his
health interfered with further
participation in business matters,
tho it was not until about a year
ago that he was forced to look
after his physical condition to
the exclusian of all else.
His remains were interred at
the city cemetery Monday, a
very large numbpr of hif neigh
bors and acquaintances being
present to pay their last respects.
Surviving him are; I. B;Jno.
C. B.; W. M.; Mrs. Anna L.
Moore; Mary S. Hunter and
Mattie Billups.
Mr. Wiseman moved from a
farm near Mendon to the neigh
borhood where he died nearly
50 years ago, and could boast of
as
rich and well kept farm as
any man in the county.
Boy Broke Arm
A son of Frank Walker ven
tured too far out on a board
which was balanced near the
center and in the loft of a shed
on his fathers premises, Satur
day. The board tilted, the boy
tumbled and a broken arm and
badly bruised nose accompanies
him in his rounds as a result.
This boy has been kicked by
horses and mules, in fact, has
had all sorts of mishaps which
overtake venturesome youth ex
cept diving from a flying ma
chine, which feat his fond par
ents fully expect him to accom
plish as soon as he can get to an
aeroplane and go up.
Negro Soldiers Riot
There is a bunch ot negro
soldiers, a regiment, stationed
at Del Rio, Tex., that goes on
the rampage occasionally. Last
week they went out for a time
and being hilariously inclined,
they shot into some houses. Ran
gers got on their trail and in a
sort of battle, one was killed by
ranger and the blacks dis
persed. The verdict of the
coroners jury was justifiable
homicide, and the community
has prepared a petition asking
that the dusky defenders of
Uncle Sam be removed from the
country.
Sterner-Minor
C. Orbrey Sterner and Miss
Pearl Minor were married at the
residence of the brides aunt,
Mrs. George Crosswhite in
Mexico, Mo., Wednesday even
ing of last week, Rev. A.
Shullenberger conducting the
wedding. The young couple
left for a trip to Hannibal and
other points on a short tour,
after which they returned to
this city and took up their resi
dence in the M. F. Franklin
property on the north-east boule
vard.
Mr. Sterner has been the
bookkeeper at the Farmerr Bank
tor several years, and a more
faithful, painstaking man for
the place could not be found.
He is ason of Mr. and Mrs. N.
L. Sterner of near Mike and
most exemplary young business
man and the Supt. of the Chris
tian Church Sunday school o
this city.
Mrs. reari Minor sterner is
the daughter of Mr. and Mrs
Larkin Minor of northeast o:
the city, and is nearly as wel
known in town as a resident
She is handsome and accomplish
ed is all things necessary to a
good wife and companion, and
we predict years of unalloyed
happiness and prosperity for the
couple.
Villa Far Ahead of Pursuers
His Capture Uncertain
Far South
Reports from the headquarters
of the general in pursuit of
Francisco Villa are not only
meager but in many cases, con
flicting. One reliable report
however is that Villa is still at
large and ahead of our troops.
The probability of his early cap
ture is one day reported and the
next information is that he is
getting away faster than ever
and that the supposition that he
is being greatly aided by his
own nation as well as by people
who have been in accord with
his methods, seems well founded.
European War
The fighting i3 still around
Verdun and with about as much
in favor of the Allies as the
Germans. The sinking of mer-
chant vessels has been going on
during the past two weeks to a
great rate, no less than 60 hav
ing been sunk in a fortnight and
many with Americans aboard,
tho no deaths among them.
The President and Cabinet are
greatly worried over the situa
tion and the relationships be
tween th:3 country and Ger
many are more strained than
ever over the extensive sinking
of vessels with Americans
aboard. Congress and Senator
Stone, chairman of the Foreign
relations Committee are standing
with the President.
Ferry Delayed
Capt. Smith was in Bruns
wick the latter part of last week
and informed the Commercial
Club that he could not possibly
get to the place with his boat
by the 15th. of this month and
was granted an extension o
time. He says his good boat
was under 18 feet of water and
that conditions had been such
that he could not get it up and
in shape to bring to the city by
the time he had engaged to do
so.
Suffrage vs Liquor
Rev. E. Combie Smith, pastor
of a Methodist Church in St.
Louis in an address last week
before the central branch W. C.
T. U. declared woman suffrage
no panacea tor the liquor ques
tion. He pointed out that only
five of the states which permitt
ed women to vote were dry and
poorly dry at that, and also re
fered to the recent elections in
Illinois where many of the towns
which had adopted prohibitory
methods a few years ago, went
wet.
Mrs. Nellie Burger followed
Dr. Smith and told the 100 wo
men present that every effort
would be made to elect a legis
lature which would pass statu
tory prohibition in this state.
She declared that prohibition had
no chance to win at the polls
this year. She said further;
Our association is not behind
the initiative petitions which
are Deing circulated asking tor
a vote on the liquor question at
the election in November. Sub
mitting the question to the
voters at this time is, we think,
regretable, illtimed, suicidal
and criminal."
Mrs. Berger, like many others,
does not wisn to lec the ques
tion be settled by a majority
vote of the people of the state,
but hopes to get what they
want in spite of public sent!

Rev. Simonton, pastor of the
Presbyterian Church has been
here this week attending Presby
tery.
High School Notes
We lost out in one of. the con
tests, but wait.
The Parent Teachers Organi
zation held a meeting Thursday
at) which important business
was transacted and a splendid
program rendered by the lower
grade pupils.
The entire school was delight-
over the arrival Monday of
the books to be added to the
ibrary. The collection was
large and excellent, containing
works on nearly every Eubject.
IThe traveling library took its
departure Thursday and it will
not be missed so much as it
would have been but for the
arrival of the new books for the
school library.
IThe boys completed their
elimination for the athletic con
test at Brunswick Tuesday and
the entries were handed to the
secretary of the association.
Every thot of other things has
been displaced by anticipation of
the great events at Brunswick
The entire high school will likely
witness the contests and arrange
ments have been made to get up
and hustle towards the city by
train, auto, carnage and any
other old way, to get there.
The only visitors this week

ok agents.
Car Shortage
The chairman of the Public
Service Commission is out in a
statement that there is a great
shortage of cars and advises
shippers about as follows; they
should place their orders at least
48 hours prior to the time
they wish to use cars; not
order in excess of the cars they
can load in 24 hours; they should
load cars to capacity, especially
in grain and its products; con
signees should unload cars with
out delay, and he advises that
carriers should place cars prompt
ly and without discrimination
and alter loaded move them on
the first train.
The fact that there is a short
age of cars at this season of the
year indicates that the railroads
are doing big business.
Charged With Robbery
Sheriff Hurt arrested Dave
Minich and Clarence Wooldridge
at the home of Dave south of
Mike Tuesday morning on a
warrant charging them with
rubbery sworn out against them
by Frank Payne, a resident of
the neighborhood.
The allegation is that Minich
saw Payne go to the home of
Wooldridge when Wooldridge was
absent, and informed Wooldridge
of it and it was agreed between
themthatMimchshouldtellPayne
that Wooldridge knew of the
visit and was on his trail if he
did not dig up $50.00. Woold
ridge alleges that he dug,
against the peace and dignity of
the state as well as against his
own inclination, and that upon
sober reflection, he concluded he
had been robbed and so com
plains.
Minich and Wooldridge gave
bond for their appearance for
preliminary hearing before Jus
tice Clarkson at Pee Dee Satur
day.
Huck West returned the first
of the week and was promptly
placed under arrest by Deputy
Sheriff Gardner on an old war
rant charging him with viola
tion of the local option law. He
is out On bond,
Lawrence Sigloch wrote to
homefolks that he is very much
pleased with his position and
the town. Lawrence can make
himself at home wherever there
is a lot of work or a chance to
study bugology.
IMPORTANT TAX CASE
County Court to Hear Next
Tuesday. Drainage District
Matter. Some Question.
Next Tuesday the County
Court will hear for the second
time the arguments pro and con
on the question of a second
assessment for tax againt drain
age districts for the purpose of
keeping ditches free of obstruc
tions.
Every tax payer who has
drainage tax to pay will be in
terested in the decision of the
court, for the issue appears to be
that those whose land abuts on
the ditch should be forced to pay
the necessary expense of keeping
the ditch in working order and
those so located contending that
the assessment for such purposes
should be made against all the
land taxed for building the
ditch.
Une thing is plain, and that is
that the law requires that drain
age ditches be kept free of ob-
structionr, and it will be for the
county court to determine who
must foot the bills.
New Destroyer
John Hays Hammond Jr. the
son ot tne mining expert, nas
sold to the government all right,
title and interest in and to a
patent on the greatest destroyer
known to the age.
The invincible war implement
called "radio-dynamic torpe
do" and can oe launched trom
shore, a vessel or an aeroplane,
and will destroy the largest ship
at twenty eight miles. It can
be directed accurately by the
radio-dynamic process, being
capable of being turned when in
motion.
The young man, he is only 26
years old. will be paid nearly a
million dollars for his invention
by the government and tho he
could have gotten a much larg
er sum from England, he favor
ed this country.
Cleaned Up
Friday there was a cleanup
squad at work in several places
while snow was falling, the one
thing favorable being that no
dust was flying.
The rubbish that was hauled
off showed the general condition
of filthiness better than it could
be observed while the refuse was
scattered. It was a matter of
little surprise however, to many,
that there was so little compared
with former years. The system
of cleaning up every year early
in the spring has made its per
manent mark. Not only health
is promoted but appearance is
improved, even tho the refuse is
generally in alleys and other sup
posed out-of-the-way places.
Monday the street commission-
erwas after the ruooisn witn
wagons and we' all feel cleaner,
tho there is some improvement
which could be made yet, the
scraggly limbs on trees, warped
fruit trees which appear to have
never had a trimming and yards
so full of brushy shrubbery that
they do not get clear of un
healthy moisture from the be
ginning to the end of a year,
Some more clearing should be
done, not only along streets, but
in the school campus and Price
Park. The pretty view should
not be obscured by jungle growth
nor the public health impaired by
everlasting dense shade.
