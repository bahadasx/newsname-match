Hat for Villa Will Centime,
the Cabinet Having Deter
cined Not to Meet Car
ranza's Request at Present
Washington, April 14. American
troopa will remain In Mexico for the
present at least. The cabinet at 1U
session today determined not to
change Its policy. This means tbe
bunt for Villa will proceed.
After tbe session It waa stated that
Carranxa's request for. withdrawal
of American soldlen had not been
answered. Consul Rodgers, In Mex
ico City, has not been Instructed to
treat with Carranxa toward an amic
able settlement The cabinet mem
bers failed to Indicate when they In
tended to reply to tho request.
No light on President Wilson's
stand during the cabinet meeting waa
obtainable.
Lack of definite Information on
events led Carranxa yesterday to wire
a renewal of bla request that the
Americans withdraw and this pre
vented the cabinet from deciding lta
future course. But for the present
It was made clear tbat there would
be no change. The cabinet members
unanimously decided to gather all
the facts before attempting final ac
tion. .
ELEVEN TREACHEROUS
ZAPATISTAS EXECUTED
Galveston, April 14. Upon or
ders from General Zapata, eleven
former Zapatistas, accused of treach
ery, have been executed in Mexico,
according .to a cable received at the
Mexican consulate here. Tbe advices
were (believed to be official. It was
charged the men had conspired to
murder Zapata.
Washington, April 14. Momen
tarily forgetting the threatened break
with Germany, official Washington
sought an answer today to these ques
tions: ' What were the facts at , Parral,
where American soldiers fought Mex
ican civilians with the loss of an
American life?
What will President Wilson do?
It waa hoped that a reply to the
first question would be found In
BrlgadleKSeneral John J. Pershing's
dispatches, supplementing the reports
from Carranslsta sources.
The cabinet was expected to an
swer the second Inquiry. , There was
reason to believe the president would
meet with his advisors with his mind
made up that withdrawal of United
States soldiers from Mexico is essen
tial to the humanitarian purpose for
which they, entered.
President Wilson last night turned
his Jefferson day address to demo
crats loaders Into a challenge, asking
In effect: ,.
."Have you the. courage to come
out?" , . .......
His words pur.zled the banqueters.
If tho president's statements meant
that he proposed a withdrawal of
troops, it was indicated that such a
move would meet opposition In his
own party. .,' , . ' ;
President . Wilson Is known to be

EI Paso, April 14. United States
troops at Parral are facing a critical
situation. It was reported today.
Official Mexican accounts of the fight
there said a band of supposed VII
llstas, defeated fey ' Americans at
Troya on Monday, retreated toward
Parral. The American cavalry pur
sued them, but found a strong senti
ment against "gringoes" at Parral.
The clash on Wednesday followed.
It waa also reported that forces of
Vllllstaa or independent bandits were
between. v. the ' advanced American
guards and the base of operations 'at
San Antonio (Mexico).
A party of 200 attacked' a cattle
train three miles from Parral. This
organization may have been among
the Mexicans that fought. Americans
In the streets of Parral. '
Other bandits in that vicinity de
feated the Carranxa garrison at Pilar
de Cochos, driving them back Into

Valle were also beaten by guerilla
horsemen.

to allow the Mexicans to save them
selves. He feels that failure to find
a meana whereby the American
columns may withdraw with honor
from Mexico means Intervention.
President Wilson recognises that
a fight In his own ranks may develop,
it Is believed, as he told the ban
queters: .
"Gentlemen, I am not Interested
In personal ambitions. I am not en
thuslastlo over mere party success."
While the trouble at Parral tem
porarily 'overshadowed the task of
catching Villa, army men Indicated
a fear that the .bandit chief had es
caped and that only with Carransa's
co-operation could the Americans
hope to overtake him.
Secretary of War Baker would not
comment with regard to the request
tor withdrawal of American troops.
He said that General Funston had
been given a free hand to control the
Parral situation. Baker's under
standing Is that there Is no objection
to the passage of troopa through
towns or cities on the line of march,
though the soldiers have been order
ed not to occupy any settlements.
It is likely that Consul Rodgors
will confer with Carranxa In Mexico

Although Secretary Baker would
not verify tho report, It was learned

Edwin Huxley, first American sur
vivor of the Sussex disaster to get
home, arrived on the St. Paul. He
ridiculed the German statement that
another ship, not the Sussex, was
torpedoed near It at almost the same
hour the terrific explosion killed
many aboard the channel steamer.
"We were afloat nine hours after
the exploalon," said Huxley. "Dur

SUSSEX
EVIDENCE
Berlin, April 14 Germany is for
warding to the United States all avail
able evidence tending to throw light
on the British channel steamer Sussex
explosion. The foreign office , last
Tuesday handed Ambassador Gerard
two pencil sketches of the vessel tor
pedoed near where the Sussex was
damaged. These sketches were made
by officers of the submarine. Gerard
was also given the London Graphic's
photographs of the Sussex, showing
it to be entirely different from the
steamer which the U boat attacked.
Germans believe that President
Wilson will not act until he receives
these drawings. . Newspapers here ap
plaud the latest German note and ex
press renewed hope of a satisfactory
settlement. Count Reventlow albne
is irritated over the controversy.
"America," he says, "thinks it is
an opportune time to drum up a fire
of notes at (Berlin every time an
enemy ship Is destroyed in, northern
European waters. We restrict our
selves in comment." '
