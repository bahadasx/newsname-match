A STUDENT JOKE.
Canaplracy of Signet That Put tb
Professor In a Panic
, Professor Elias Loomi3 for mav
years occupied the chair of astrono
my at Yale and was the author oi
the well known series of mathemat
ical text books.
Professor Loomis repeated each i
year to the junior class a course o'
lectures on physics. The lecture
were illustrated by axperimcal.
and in one on compressed air U
explained the principle of the we
known air gun.
The students of each succeeding
class as they entered the room foj
this particular lecture found on the
i lide of the room remote from the
tplatform a small target. A'f'er ex

-Professor Loomis was' in the ,h"abit
of landing three of its projectiles
with mathematical accuracy in the
"center of the bullseye.

it was apparently only a scientific

although the students saw that the
bullseve was perforated as usual,
..there was not a sound of applause.
Professor Loomis looked a moment
atWe clas- in a startled way, then
at the target and then with a de-
gree of emotion he had never be-
fore shown, esclaimed:
Didn't It hit? -Didnt it hit?
Didn't it hit ?"
. A roar of laughter, followed bj
even more than, the usual applause,
ahowed the professor that he had
not lost his mathematical accuracy.

The movement is under the direction of the State Park Memorial

A park committee is to be formed in each county which is to sup
port the state committee work in raising funds.
Each county committae iß to make a survey of its county to list up
what it has that is beat adapted for park purposes, this survey to in

HEIRLOOM OF 1916
great park idea, increasing the num
ber until every county has one or more
parks in the state chain, and they can,
too, go on with the development of
highways and boulevards to connect
each beauty spot with aU the others
in the system.
There is a broad spirit of civic un
selfishness in this state park idea. It
means taat the parks will be as con
venient and free to th people of the
rural communities as to tha psopla of
the cities and towna. It aas, too,

After his parents died, John Lusk
occupied tho home and lived the life
of a hermit. Neither he nor his father
ever permitted the natural beauty of
Turkey Run to be disturbed, although
the hundreds of stately trees are
worth perhaps $B0.0O0.
Turkey Run abounds in rocky gorges
and 100-foot cliffs of sandstone. Sugar
creek has carved some striking scen
ery out of the rock, and the whole
place is a paradise of trees, flowers
and native birds. Turkey Run has

After Turkey Run is acquired as a
state park, and there is no doubt the
public will subscribe a great fund for
state park purposes, the state commit

of other beauty spots that are to

Üfidn't Suit Washington.

eentury Milf ord, Conn., had a house
in which "Washington was said to
have speii a night. It was in 1789,
when Washington made a tour of
New Eagland. Tradition says that
there were certain things about hi
stay at the Milf ord tavern which h

fore him consisted of boiled men
and potatoes. Ho was not please,
with tho meal and a?l:ed for a bow

brought the new order and a brokei

If Z?11, look the mP of

Connecticut. One of them ist in
Granby to-nship, a little north-
west of Hartford, and the other in
Enfield township, on the Connecti
cut river, south of Springfield. It
is a standing conundrum why, so
long as the boundary is imaginary,
they did not make it straight in-,
stead of crooked. But thereby
hangs a tale.
Those two little jogs on tho map
are monuments to human obstinacy
and to the persistency which is one
of the chief traits of the Yankee
character. The ancestors of tho
farmers who own those little spots
of ground preferred to live in Mas
sachusetts rather than in Connecti
cut and fought for their preference
until they had their way.
The controversy began in 1713
and continued for 112 years before
it was finally decided. In 1724 tho
question was appealed to England,
but the government was so much
engrossed in the Seven Years' war
that it was never brought to the at
tention of the crown. Up to tho
ontDreaK oi tne itevomcion Dotn
states continued to levy taxes and
send notices of fast dars and elec
tions to the farmers who occupied
the land, and there is no record of
how the3f .avoided one or whether
they paid both. Later, however,
they voted and paid taxes in Massa
chusetts only, notwithstanding the
protest of the county authorities in
Connecticut. In 1793, after peace
was restored, both states appointed
commissioners, but tho dispute was
carried on until 1804, when a com
promise was reached. Therrwcre

was reached hy which Massa
chusetts consented to surrender her
claim to a strip of territory in
Woodstock and Suffield townships,
provided Connecticut would yield
her claims to the other tracts in
dispute. iSo action, however, was
taken upon ihe report.
In IS 10 the controversy was re
vived by some Icral proceeding, and
another coirjnis:on was appointed,
but if it ever re "hl a conclusion
there is no nrrrvi to be found. In
1820 a third commission wa9 in
trusted with tl.e settlement, , and
after two years tcy decided upon
the preterit bou.:;!ary line, which
was adopted by ii e legislature of
both states. Exchui.ze..
