EKALAKA, (FALLON COUNTY) MONTANA, FRIDAY, APRIL 14. 1916.
NUMBER IS
ROOSEVELT THE "IT"
Romney Says T. R. Will Be
The Candidate.
By Kenneth Romney.
Woodrow Wilson of New Jersey
and Thomas R. Marshall of In
diana.
Theodore Roosevelt of New
York, an<LCharles W. Fairbanks
of Indian?.
Those'are the democaatic and
republican tickets respectively
that Washington politicians who
try to take the unbiased view
would not be surprised to see in
the field this November. Senator
Sherman of Illinois or Senator
Harding of Ohio might take the
place of Fairbanks, who has pre
sidential ambitions of his own,
but politicians of both parties
here believe that Roosevelt will
head the party which four years
ago he denounced in scathing
terms from sea to sea.
Several plans have been sug
gested as to just how Roosevelt
is going to force the repulbican
party to name him as their stand
ard bearer. The latest explana
tion of the plan is that at the
bull moose convention, which
meet at the same time as the re
publican national convention, will
organize quickly and nominate
Mr. Roosevelt before the repub
lican convention gets straighten
ed out. Then, with Roosevelt
already in the field prepared to
to make a powerful campaign
and with many of his followers
in the republican convention, the
republicans will be forced to
nominate him or face the cer
tainty of two republican tickets
and inevitable defeat. Besides,
with Roosevelt already named by
the bull moose convention, none
of the crowd of the republican
white hopes now mentioned wili
care for the worthless nomination.
This is a daring plan but friends
and admirers of the colonel point
out that he is nothing if not dar
ing, while many former republi
can office holders are hungry mc
care for nothing except union
and the prospect of victory.
Meanwhile there is not a cloud
un the democratic horizon visible
in Washington. Wilson in the
last few weeks has been increas
ing his already great popularit\
until it is believed that he is a! :
but invincible. A recent poli
conducted by the Nation in Nev\
York, gave him as many votes as
all contenders put together ant,
indicated that hundreds of repub
licans who voted against him in
1912 are for him now. Many
voters, in marking their ballots,
declared they were republicans
and voted against the president
in the last election, but are foi
him now because he has not on h

guided the nation through the
most troublous period since the
civil war, but has brought the
country to the highest pitch of
prosperity it has ever attained.
The republican party v. ill not
only enter the campaign handi
capped by harmony, no matter
who is nominated, but also desti
tute of an issue to appeal to the
people. The tariff issue has been
neutralized by the war, the trust
question is no longer agitated,
preparedness is being rapidly put
into effect and prosperity stalks
across the land with gigantic
tread. Carping republican cri
tics may try to make capital out
out of the number of American
lives lost by submarine attacks
and in Mexico, but the people
who in the last analysis care only
for facts, can see only that Wil
son has kept the nation ^t peace
under difficulties unprecedent in
American history.
Economic issues will also fall
upon deaf ears, in view of the un
exampled prosperity of the coun
try, and what dissatisfaction was
manifested over the Mexican sit
uation has been dispelled by the
punitive expedition that is now
following the tortuos trail of Villa
below the Rio Grande.
There has been sporadic talk
of a successor to Vice-President
Marshall on the democratic ticket,
and the the names of Senator
Lewis of Illinois and Governor
Major of Missouri have been
mentioned. This talk, however,
has not been taken seriously in
Washington. It w a s pointed
out that it is an unusual thing
to break up a winning combina
tion and the history of national
conventions shows that it has
been at least 30 years since
a winning vice-presidential can
didate has been displaced for
someone else.

On going to the polls April 21st
for the presidential primary elec

to the Domocratic National Con

first year that the women of Mon
tana have been allowed to take
part in a primary of this kind,
the democratic party feels that
that a woman should be elected
a delegate. Mrs. Houstan is one
of the brainiest women of the
State, a wage earner, a capable
newspaper writer, a good speaker
and well versed in matters politi
cally. We believe the democrats
should vote for Mrs. Houstan.

D. B. Humphrey
On Labor Troubles
Declaring that Colorado had
been set back fifty years in de
evlopment because of labor dis
turbances, D. B. Humphrey a
widely known Denver newspaper
man on a recent visit here said if
the state had a man like Gover
nor Stewart at the head, all the
trouble would|have been avoided.
Reviewing the numerous stri
kes which occured at intervals,
just when the state was begin
ning to recover from a previous
disturbace, Mr. Humphrey said
that whep trouble threatened in
Butte something over a year ago,
Coloradoans watched with inter
est and when they saw Governor
Stewart taking a firm yet tachful
hold of the situation and stamp
ing out the beginning of what
might have been a conflagration,
they prayed that God would give
them a governor like Stewart.
"People of Montana will, per
haps, never know just how much
good Governor Stewart did this
state by his prompt and firm ac
tion against the I. W. W. and
professiohal trouble makers."
said, Mr. Humphrey. "As a result
Montana is growing faster than
any other state in the union.
More settlers are coming in land
land values are incrasing by leaps
and bounds, prosperity is general
and yet it is fair to say if the sit
uation in Butte had gotten away
from the Governor or had been
allowed to drift, Butte would
have been wrecked like Cripple
Creek.
"Every property owner who
feels secure in his rights; every
working man who is receiving
his pay check with regularity;
every farmer who watches the
increase in the value of his land;
and every business man who finds
business good and collections easy
should thank Governor Stewart
! for saving Montana from the
; shame and disgrace suffered by
; Colorado simply because it had a
j intentioned but weak-kneed exe
cutive. "

Horsemen
, Representatives of the Montana
Livestock Sanitary Board will be
in Fallon County on and after
April 22nd, 1916. for the purpose
of testing, for dourine, all mares
and stallions of breeding age.
There will be suffiicient number
of inspectors in this district to
handle the work in a systematic
and expeditious manner but the
hearty co-operation of the horse
men will be necessary.
Any inquiries regarding dates
for testing should be addressed
to Montana Livestock Sanitary
Board.
