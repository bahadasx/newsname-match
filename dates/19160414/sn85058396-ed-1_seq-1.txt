I', Washington, April 14. Secretary
j, Lansing announced today that he was
prepared to treat with Gen. Carranza's
proposal for the withdrawal of Ameri
can troops from Mexico. It was added,
' however, that no immediate withdraw
H 4 al was in contemplation. The United
i ' States will inform Gen. Carranza to
a I that effect soon and discuss with him
1 J the time and manner of the removal
I , of the troops. The secretary's an-
j nouncement was taken to mean that,
S . Inasmuch as the United States fully
n ' expected to withdraw the troops when
E i the Villa chase was ended, some for-
U ; mal arrangement will be made.
H ..Secretary Lansing said the United
jt States had not agreed to restrict the
;j punitive expedition to the territory
k it had reached by March 23 and that
I there evidently was some misunder-
3 standing on Gen. Carranza's part in
that respect.

awaiting orders from the Mexican min
ister of war, Gen. Obregon. to move
into Chihuahua for the announced pur
pose of taking up the pursuit of Villa.
In the event of trouble with the de
facto government, Gen. Gomez would
be in position to strike the line of
American communications at Casas
Grandes.
Official Details Anxiously Awaited.
Official advices giving details of
the fight at Parral where a detach
ment of 140 American cavalrymen
were attacked by citizens are still anx
iously awaited.
Mexican Consul Andres Garcia had
no further Information than was .con
tained in the message from Gen. Obre
gon. Battle Was Desoerate.
There are unconfirmed reports that
the battle in Parral was more desper
ate than indicated in the Mexican of
ficial advices and that it lasted for
three hours. One report hed it that
more than one. hundred Mexican civili
ans and Carranza soldiers were kill
ed and wounded and that one Ameri
can soldier was killed and several
wounded The Americans were said
to have used a machine gun in the
battle.
The advance guard which met the
unexpected attack in Parral probably
has passed the Chihuahua-Durango
line and now Is In a district where
Villa has a Btrong following and there
is little love for the "gringo."
From different sections of lower
Chihuahua some vague reports of dis
orders arising from economic condi
tions and that the de facto government
is having difficulty in maintaining
order.

The fight which occurred about 9
o'clock last night was several miles
in the rear of the autos carrying Gen

bandits who tried to capture one
truck came up, the Americans poured
in five volleys which ended the fight
completely. There were two attacks,
the first a slight one and directed
against a forward truck. The last
attack was a rush against the roar
trucks, during which bullets flew
against the autos and poured through
the brush which covered the mesa.
Expected Easy Capture.
The- bandits seemed to think the
cutting off of the rear truck would
be easy because some of them got
within a few feet of it before the
Americans, who were withholding
their fire, cut loos.e

Arrival.
Mexico Ctly, April 14 General Car
ranza, who arrived on the outskirts
of Mexico City yesterday, entered the
city shortly after 8 o'clock this morn
ing, accompanied by a few members
of his staff. His entry was unherald
ed nnd without ostentation. Few of
the inhabitants, except those who rec
ognized him as he passed through tho
streets, knew he had arrived.
Triumphal arches were built
months ago along the Paseo do la Iio
forma, Avenida Juarez and Avenlda
rrancesco do Madero, and froutlng
the railway stations, palaces, and
Chapultepoo park, in expectation of n
great public celebration when the
first chief entered the metropolis.
General Carranza did not pass under
one of the arches. He went to a pri
vate house and, after resting and
changing his attire, proceeded, to the
national palace. Other prominent
figures in the revolution entered as
quietly as did General Carranza. Gen

cretion of 30,000 Men.
GENERAL IS ONLY JUDGE
Official Version of Parral Inci
dent Anxiously Awaited
Responsibility to Be
Fixed.
Washington, April 14. Secretary
Baker said today there had been as
yet no change in General Funston's
orders but declined to discuss ques
tions of policy raised by the Carran
za note. The border commander's
hands were entirely free, he said, to
make any necessary disposition of the
30.000 men under his command. Dis
patch of troops to strengthen the sup
porting lines or the shifting of border
torces to places best adapted to everi1
tualtities are matters of which Gen
eral Funston himself Is the only
judge, in the war department's view.
An official version of the Parral
incident is awaited anxiously. Since
General Carranza sharply criticised
the American commander in trans
mitting a report of what happened, of
ficials hero feel it is necessary to
have the American officers' responsi
bility concerning the Incident, fixed.
Gen. Funston Kept Busy.
San Antonio, April 14 General Fun
ston still was endeavoring early to
day to learn from Gen. Pershing the
American side of the story of the fighr
at Parral. Every available means of
communication has been employed to
get to Gen. Pershing the Instructions
to rush to headquarters with all pos
sible speed a report on tho Incident
and tho measures he has taken to re
lieve the little cavalry force that was
forced to fight for its life Wednes
day night
Gen. Funston and his staff officers
realized that General Pershing, be
cause of his own location far to the
front would have difficulty in getting
on account of the developments and
forwarding it to the border.
Secretary Baker's Instructions had
not reached Gen Funston earlv todav
but already scouts were Investigating
Carranza troop movements in north

CASE AGAINST
THE GERMANS
Sussex and Other Ships Were
Destroyed in Violation of
Promises to United
States.
NOTE TO GO PROMPTLY
Germany's Good Faith to Be
Determined by Statement of
Facts More Affidavits
Arrive.
Washington, April 14. Secretary
Lansing acknowledged late today that
the United States Is in possession of
evidence secured by the French naval
forces from a captured German sub
marine crew, tending to show the
identity of the submarine which de
stroyed the Sussex. The state de
partment is developing it and mean-'
while it will not be disclosed.
wasmngton, April 14 After a pro
longed cnbinet meeting today it was
announced that a communication to
Germany would go forward as plan
ned, probably within the next forty
eight hours. It was said the case
was complete without the "affidavits
which arrived today on the St Paul.
The plan to present the American
case came with the accumulation of
evidence that not the Sussex alone
but other ships as well have been de
stroyed in violation of Germany's
promises to the United States re
mained unchanged. With the state
ment of fact will be determined Ger
many's good faith to make good her
assurances. Nothing in the nature
of a time limit will be attached It
was understood.
more Evidence Arrives.
New York, April It Guarded by
Sir Charles Allom of the British for
eign office tho evidence In tho Sus
sex case which has been gathered
for tho American government, arrived
on tho liner St. Paul. It included af
fidavits of the survivors gathered by
attaches of the American embassies
in Paris and London. Among the St.
Paul's 5S6 passengers was Edward H.
Huxley of Englewood, N J., president
of tho United States Rubber Export
company of this city who was a pas
senger on the Sussex, escaping unin
jured. Mr. Huxley stated positively
that from the hour that the vessel
left tho British shore until tho mo
ment she was attacked, and for nine
hours thereafter, not another vessel
was sighted except tho destroyer
which came to the rescue.
German Statement Refuted.
Mr. Huxley made this assertion in
connection with the text of Germany's
note of April 10 to the state depart
ment, citing an attack by a German
submarino on an unnamed vessel in
the vicinity of the Sussex at the hour
when the latter met with mishap.
Mr. Huxley also said he was posi
tive the Sussex carried no ammuni
tion. The German note declared that
a violent explosion on the ship which
was torpedoed warranted the "cer
tain conclusion that great amounts
of munitions were aboard."
Mr. Huxley showed a letter which
he said had been written by Captain
Thomas Carroll, French embarkation
officer at Boulogne, France, in which
Captain Carroll said: "I have just
helped take from the Sussex, beach
ed nearby, the body of a poor woman
with a piece of a Gorman torpedo
Imbedded in her stomach."

details, even to the namo of tho com
mander and number of tho submarine
have been communicated privately
to the American government
The ministry of marine was not
prepared today to make this informa
tion public but it has been given not
only to the United States but to all
other governments interested.
One reason tho authorities refrain
from giving out details Is that it Is
their understanding that they are act
ing In conformity with the wisheB of
tho American government It is nlso
the desire of French officials to give
Germany an opportunity to reply to
the statement that the name of tho
commander and number of the sub
marine are known.
It Is understood that somo of the
fragments of the Instrument which
caused the explosion found on the Sus

Paris, April 1, 11:45 a. m. West of
the Meuse a violent bombardment was
delivered by the Germans against the
French lines to the west of Hill 301,
says the French official statement this
morning. Yesterday evening, east of
the Meuse a small attack was made
on the French positions south of Dou
aumont, hut it was completely repuls
ed. There was a lively bombardment
south of Houdremont In the Woevre
district artillery duels took place.
The text of the statement reads:
"On the west bank of the Meuse
there was a violent bombardment last
night of our first line west of Hill 304.
On the right bank the Germans yes
terday evening delivered an "unex
pected small attack against our positions--
south of Douaumont but the
movement was completely repulsed.
"The night passed in relative quiet
with the exception of a fairly spirited
bombardment in the region south of
Haudremont.
"In the Woevre there has been an
artillery duel in the sector of Moul-
is reported from the rest of the front."
Berlin, April 14, via London, 3'50
p. m. The text of the official state
ment given out today at the German
army headquarters says-
"Western theater: Apart from oc
casional lively artillery duels in the
region of the Meuse there is nothing
to report Attempts made by the en
emy to attack on the left bank of tho
Meuse were arrested by our artillery
fire as the attacking parties left their
trenches.
"Eastern theater: Army group of
Field Marshal von Hindenburg: Minor

south of Lake Narocz, were ropulsed

tlance, east of Gievgell, without doing
any damage."
Turks Are Defeated.
London, April 14, 2'2G p. m. De
feat of the Turkish forces In Mesopo
tamia by tho British was reported of
ficially. In an action on the Tigris,
the Turks were driven back from one
and one half to three miles.
The text follows
"General Lake reports that on the
afternoon of April 12 our forces on
the right (South) bank of the Tigris
forced back the enemy's advanced
lines over a distance varying from one
and one half to three miles.
"To do this they had to cross an
inundated belt intersected by deep
cuts from 500 to 1,200 yards wide, ex
tending from the Tigris to tho Umm-El-Brahm
marsh.
"On the left bank water from the
marshes has beon driven by a north
west gale into some of the enemy's
trenches at Sannanyat. The enemy
was heavily punished as he took re
fuge from the flood In the new posi
tion." "An enemy torpedo boat which ap
peared off Smyrna was driven away
bv our artillery A patrol boat off Te
h'csrne (Asia Minor) was hit by our
artillery.
"On the ninth bandits on Tour large
barges attempted to land near Kala
maki west of Kush Adassi (south of
Smyrna) hut were forced to retreat
by the fire of our artillery."
The announcement of the British
victory came at a time when the pub
lie was beginning to fear efforts to
relieve the force of Gen. Townshend
at Kut-el-Amara were doomed to fail
ure, owing to tho check suffered by
the relieving army a few days ago,
and the difficult conditions brought ,
about by floods.
Many military writers In England
believed the floods had made the re
lief of Gen. Townshend almost an Im
possibility, hut today's official report
shows that, Instead of hindering the
British, the high water has helped
tho forces of Lieut, Gen. Gorringe In
one of the most difficult tasks under
taken by the British army. Each mile
the Turks are forced back makes the
British operations easier for as they
approach Kut-ol-Amara, the Turks are
compelled to defend a wider front In
view of today's news, theroforo, tho
prospect of rescuing the army at Kut-el-Amara
is regarded as better than it
has been for some time.
