The valuation of land in 45 town
ships in Beltrami county has in
creased $4,540,130 since 1911 as a
result of the construction of ditches,
according to a statement prepared
today for the John Nuveen Bond com
pany of Chicago, by J. L. George,
county auditor.
In 1911 there was assessed in the
45 townships a total of 172,767 acres
with a valuation of $465,319. In
that year the basis for valuation was
fifty per cent of the actual. This
would make the real value about
$930,638.
Acreage Increases.
In 1915 there was assessed in the
45 townships a total of 398,410 acres
with a valuation of $1,543,746. In
that year the basis of valuation was
made by law thirty-three and one
third per cent. This would make the
real value about $4,631,238, an in
crease of $3,700,000.
In addition to the above increase,
there is reported from the land office
for entry on the tax lists of 1916, al
ready, 85,953 acres, the real value
of which will be in the neighborhood
of ten dollars an acre or 559,530,
making a total valuation due to
drainage of $4,540,130.
Want More Ditches.
Taking the district covered by
ditches 11 and 12, the first to be es
tablished in this county and cover
ing nine townships just northwest of
Red Lake, the acreage in 1911 was
57,301, with a valuation of $119,600
or a real value of $239,200.
In 1915 the acreage was 160,719,
with a valuation of $635,647, or a
real value of $1,906,941, showing an
increase of $1,667,741 in five years.
This does not include personal prop
erty values, which have also largely
increased
The settlers and taxpayers of these
nine townships are not only show
ing their willingness to pay interest
and hen on ditches 11 and 12, but
are petitioning for further ditching
in the way of laterals and branches.

George, while compiled from actual
figures as shown by the records, does
not by any means show the entire

benefits derived from the drainage of
this district.
Roads Constructed.
It is pointed out in the statement
that every mile of ditch means a mile
of road of some kind, sometimes very
good, and sometimes very poor, but
in all cases affording better means of
travel better than no road. Many
of these roads are now being used for
automobile travel. As there are
something over 1,600 miles of these
roads, probably one-half of which
are good roads, the value cannot be
underestimated, as they could not
have been constructed in any other
way.
A small percentage of the lands
which are assessed for benefits will
probably not be available for culti
vation for many years, but it is safe
to say that not less than ninety per
cent will be taken under the various
homestead acts, and will pay the
ditch interest and principal as it be
comes due. The county can well af
ford to carry the balance in consid
eration of the additional valuation.
Ask Amendment.
Under the provisions of the Vol
stead Act, all moneys received at the
sale ot these lands in excess to the
total. drainage assessment must be
paid to the government as a bonus.
County Auditor George is endeavor
ing to obtain an amendment to this
law, which will provide that any ex
cess shall be retained by the county
for the purpose of maintaining and
extending the ditches Should this
pass congress, it will mean the saving
of many thousands of dollars to the
settlers on the lands The measure
is being fought by the Chippewas on
the ground that any valuation added
by drainage should be paid to them.
The claim seems preposterous, accord
ing to Mr. George, as it is through no
efforts of theirs that the land has
any value at all. It is not reason
able to expect that their claim will
be considered
The statement of Mr. George as to
the acreage and valuation of lands in
1911 and 1915 and the increase in
valuation in the 45 townships is as

Official Reports of Battle at Parral
Not Obtainable Up to lute
Hour.
Washington, April 14.Forgetting
the danger in breaking with Germany
the nation turned toward the Parral,
Mexican affair today. Questions as
to the facts of the Parral fight and
what will the president do were
asked.
One Killed.
The first loss of American lives in
the American punitive expedition in
Mexico occurred yesterday in firing on
the American troops a Parral, by
Mexican civilians, and some reports
say Carranza soldiers fired at the
troops, killing one American and
wounding another.
General Funston wired here today
that a report on the Parral affair had
not been received. Secretary Baker
declined to discuss the withdrawal pi
the troops other than saying that
Funston had been given a free hand.
Two Courses Left.
Withdrawal or intervention are the
only two courses left, Senator Stone
of the foreign relations committee
said today after a conference with
Secretary Lansing.
San Antonio, April 14.General
Funston fears that such incidents as
the Parral fighting may precipitate a
crisis. However, the Villa hunt vrjty
be carried forward until Villa is-kill

ral is the stronghold for Villa. Fun*

Lumbermen Cited to Appear Before
State Timber Board Next
Week.
The positions of about 20 state
timber scalers are in jeopardy.
This is the result of an investiga
tion by Oscar Arneson, chief land
clerk in the office of the state auditor.
Mr. Arneson returned to St. Paul
yesterday from a trip through this
district and reported that many
scalers have been living at the ex
pense of the lumber companies.
They got free meals and board at
the lumber camps. These scalers, It
is alleged, would charge the state tor
these expenses.
Mr. Arneson stated the scalers
will be compelled to make restitution
to the state.
Mr. Arneson states the lumber
companies had ulterior motives in ex
tending free board. Nearly all com
panies logging in the North hare
failed to bark and end mark logs as
required by the state, Mr. Arneson
says.
This is especially true in the camps
where scalers have dined at the ex
pense of the companies, he says.
The scalers receive a salary ot $76
a month and expenses from the state.
They are appointed by the surveyor
general of logs and lumber.
The men have been cited to appear
before the state timber board when tt
meets at the capitol next Wednes
day.
Arneson reported today that he had
seized two more cars of logs near Gus
son, St. Louis county. They did not
have the mark that is legally re
quired. The logs had been cut by
the Virginia & Rainy Lake Lumber
company.
TO JAIL FOR 30 DAYS
FOR KILLING DEER
Walter Ester, who has been trap
ping for several months northeast ot
Blackduck, pleaded guilty in the
municipal court this morning on a
charge of killing deer out of season.
Judge Crowell sentenced him to pay
$50 fine or serve 30 days in the coun
ty jail. He chose the latter and com
menced his sentence this afternoon.
Mr. and Mrs. A. A. Warfleld re
turned at noon today from an extend
ed trip to California. Herbert War
