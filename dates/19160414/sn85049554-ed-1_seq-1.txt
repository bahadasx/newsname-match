Washington, April 14. American
Consul Edwards at El Paso tele
graphed today. His reports Indicated
there had been no further fighting In
which American troops were engaged
since the affair at Parral.
Secretary Baker today said there was
no change in the situation. He said
there had been as yet no change in
General Funston's order, but declined
to discuss questions of policy raised by
the Carranza note. The border com
mander's hands were entirely free, he
said, to make any disposition of the
troops at his command.
Shifting of border forces to places
best adapted to eventualities are mat
ters of which General Funston himself
Is the only Judge, In the war depart
ments view.
150 Reported Killed.
An official version of the Parral inci
dent Is awaited anxiously. Since Gen
eral Carranza criticized the, American
commander In reporting what happened
officials here feel it is necessary to
have the officer's own report before
conclusions are reached.-
Consul Edwards said Americana
reaching El Paso from Interior Mexico
brought varied rumors of the fighting
at Parral, but no confirmation of the
report that 150 Mexicans were killed.
All his information was that the Amer
icana

Something Aodomplished.
Chairman Stone of the foreign rela

ment had no Information to be made
public.
"The problem confronting this gov
ernment Is how long it would be wise
to keep an expeditionary force In Mex
ico," said Senator Stone. "I have never
believed that we would achieve the
capture of Villa. Diaz had a price on
Villa's head for years and could not get
him. I do not doubt that Carranza
would like to get him but be has been
unable to do so. Villa Is In his own
country and our soldiers are in a dif
ficult, unknown country. They have
succeeded In breaking up some' of
Villa's bands and have accomplished
something. I was In favor of sending
the expedition after Villa whether, jve
got him or not.
Withdraw or Intervene.
"'But we have recognized the de

can we let bur army stay in a, foreign
country where friction already exists
and Where more frlctlon^ls bound to

toward Mexico we can not keep our
army there. To my mind the only
alternative to withdrawing the troops
sooner or later is Intervention,"

There was nothing in private advices
last night to indicate that the Carranza
soldiers in Parral took part In the at
tack on the Americans.
One report Says there were two sep
arate clashes before the Americans fi
nally left Parral and that in the sec
ond encounter with the populace the
Carranza commander sent his troops to
disperse the crowd, which was being
rapidly mowed down by American bul
lets.
The public meeting held In the plaza
while the Americans were in the town
was called and addressed by men who
are said to have formerly been -allied
with Villa. They told the people that
the Americans had come to capture
their town and to loot it and that the
Mexican men, women, and' children
would be made prisoners.
Official Report on Clash.
Gen. Alvaro Obregon, Mexican minis
ter of war, has telegraphed Gen. Gabriel
Gavira, commander of the ^Juarez gar
rison, details of the Parral clash. The
dispatch, dated Queretaro, April 12,
reads:
"My department, desiring to bring to
the knowledge of the army the lament
able incident occurring yesterday in
the city of Parral, Chihuahua, between
the pople of that city and an American
force belonging to the troops engaged
In- the pursuit of Villa, communicates
this to you in order that you In turn
may make it known to your subordi
nates and give It ajlso to the press that
the people may know the facts as they
are.
"At 1 o'clock In the' afternoon an
American force composed of 150 men
entered the city and the authorities of
the same notified the commander of the
•ibid force that the Americans should
vacate It.
"The commander'of the Americans
began to carry out the wish of the au
thorities, when the people of the city
organized a meeting of protest against
the entrance Into the ctly of the Amer
ican troops without Permission.
"The civil authorities tried to avoid
a conflict, but their forces were not
sufficient to handle the situation. In
the friction which resulted one Amer
ican soldier was killed and several citi
ens were wounded.
"The municipal president, Jose de la
Luz Herrera, and the constitutionalist
generals, Garcia, Lozana and Hernan
dez, with some of their officials and
troops, tried to calm the people and
succeeded thus In avoiding an incident
that might have.tiaken very.large pro

London, April 14.—Defeat of the Tur

engagement in the Tigris, the Turks
were driven back from one and one
half to three miles.
The announcement of the British
victory came at a time when the public

Kut-El-Amara were doomed to failure
owing to the check suffered by the re
lieving army a few days ago..
Many military writers in England
believed the floods had made the re

that .the high waters have helped the
forces of Lieutenajit-General Gorringe
in one of the most difficult tasks
