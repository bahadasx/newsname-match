'EASY TO HYPNOTIZE'
M. U. Psychologist Asserts
That Control Is No Harder
Than Rocking Cradle.
"A nun's .soul is his own business.
He should alw.ijs iiniid his own busi
ness." "Xo human being can always be
safe and sane in his ujj of thinking.
There are moments when rational
thought limit give way to religion,
hi cause it is necissari. Jtut it is al
wais extra-scientific"
"The soul, or honor, of a nation
is an impossihilitv outside the realms
of poetrv and religion. If all men
would appreciate that fact, there
would not now be the slaughter of
human species by their own kind."
"Ilipnotisni is no more difficult
than rocking a babj to sleep."
Passages such as these were the
high lights of the University Assembly
lecture on "I lie Mistenes of the Soul,"
delivered by Dr Max F. Mejer of the
psjchologj department in tlie Uniicr
sitj Auditorium last night. Doctor
.Meier contends that ignorance and
misconception of the soul and of the
held of pscholog cause blindness
and intolerance in religion and goi-
ernment and make men ridiculous In
their attitude toward psjchology.
'The laj man," he eaid, "thinks psy
chology a compound of hipnotism,
thought transference and character
reading. He thinks of each person as
! soul, not a human organism subject
lo natural laws Psiihology is no
longer priuiarib inter sted in the
soul, or mmd, but in the vaiious laws
goierning tlie organism Xo one but
the man himself tan know Ins own
soul."
.Sees .Mid It liilnlcr.imc.
Religion and government Doctor
Meier regards as the fiilds which are
most often invaded by erroneous con
ceptions of the soul. "Religion is one
of the poles of the axis around which
our intolerance swings; government is
tlio other. The man interested in souls
is intolerant, for, since he cannot
know an) other s-oul than his own, he
regards all the others as recasts of
his own."
Politics and government are based
on the same misconception of people
as misterious beings. Doctor Mjer
said, beings to be rulul bi magic of
torture oi death.
"Kingship is based on this belief in
the misterious property of souls. In
stead of being regarded as an assem
blage of human organisms, tlie state
is considered as a bundle of human
souls, and the unscientific, phrase,
honor or soul of the nation, becomes
a tiling to conjure with. Ihe flag be
comes the emblem of the imperial Idea,
and there are those who demand
"Hats off!" as the Hag goe? by wheth
er or not there is any sopntineous de
sire to lift the hat. That such a cus
tom would further the interests of
each person in the United States, I
doubt on scientific mounds The man
who does not doubt it is a politician,
not a psj chologist."
H)iiolis!ii railed a M)slerj."
"Another instance of the desire to
regard tho soul as a nijster is the
popular opinion of hypnotism. The
only ridiculous thing about hypnotism
Is the attitude of the spectators " Doc
tor Mejer finds that interest in hyp
notism is tho manifestation of the
desire for power.
"In practice, 'knowing another soul'
has been disastrous. Traditional
crimlnil procedure is based on the
relation of the judge as mind reader
to the criminal as a soul. But mind
reading is difficult in proportion to ite
lalue; If the soul would not reveal it
self then torture was used.
"We call ourselves enlightened, but
it is now customary to keep the con
demned man in suspense for a consid
erable time and then to conduct him
to execution with ceremony, presum
ably for the good of his soul. We leaie
humane methods to the butcher."

TELLS OF MISS GKACE DODGE
Life and Work of 'oted Woman Dis
cussed Ijj Miss Ina Schcrrebcck.
The life and work of Miss Grace
Dodge was discussed by Miss Ina
Scherrebeck of St. Louis, Y. W. C. A.
secretary for the south central field.
iieiure me university Y. W. C. A. yes
terday afternoon.
".Miss Dodge was a very human sort
of person," Miss Scherrebeck said.
'She met each girl on the ground of a
womanhood held in common. Money,
rank and position were as trifles to
her. Her humility was genuine, and
it was real because she never stooped
lower than herself. 'A gentleman is a
man who can meet a king without em
barrassment or meet a coal heaier
without embarrassing him.' This was
her conception of the perfect stand
ard." The speaker told of the executive
ability of Miss Dodge. As a result of
her efforts, the Consumers' I.caguo
and the travelers' aid work were made
possible. She was founder of the
Teachers' College in Kew York City.
"Miss Dodge's greatest gift was in
creating character," said Miss Scher
rebeck. "She just believed anybody
into doing the best of which he or
she was capable. She rarely criti
cised, and if she eier had to do it
sue managed not to leave a sting."
Miss Mildred Nichols led the serv
ice. Miss Margaret Hawkins sang
"Face to Face."

WASHINGTON', April 14 There
will be no change in the policy of tho
United States! regarding the punitive
expedition against Villa; at least not
for the present. This was made clear
this afternoon m a session of the cabi
net after a consideration of the re
quest of President Carranza asking
the withdrawal of the American
troops in .Mexico.
The information which the cabinet
has at hand is lery meagre. The re
port of General Pershing regarding
the fighting at Parral Wednesday has
not yet been receiied.
Unconfirmed reports upon the
number or Mexicans killed after citi
zens of Parral had fired upon the
American troops range from a few to
100
Whether or not the Carranza troops
were engaged In the firing has not
been learned. Some sources insist
that the reiolt of the citizens against
the Americans was started by the
Carranza forces. That one American
soldier was killed was the report from
a reliable source this morning.

Mayor Batterton today issued the

"I want to ask the citizens of Co
lumbia to haie all the rubbish put in
old gunny sacks and set in front of
their lots, by Monday, April 17, at
noon. We will commence hauling at
that time at different parts of the
town. If you have no old sacks, put
tin's rubbish in old barrels or boxes.
But if you have old sacks they will bo
much prefernd, as wo can haul much
larger loads. 1 am making tills re
quest because when wagons pass your
house and your stuff Is not out on the
street the wagons will not return. As
this is quite expensive to the city, we
cannot afford to make more than one
trip by your door. Now this is fair
warning to eieryone."
