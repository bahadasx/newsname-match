Cabinet Decides to Call Foreign
Relations ' Committee to
White House Tomorrow.
PLAN WILL BE OUTLINED
Document Prepared for Berlin
by Lansing Will Be Shown to
Senators.
President Wilson will announce
the Administration's submarine pol
icy within the next forty-eight
hours.
This decision was reached, it ra
understood, at the Cabinet meet
ing today.
The President's plan, as authori
tatively outlined, is to cal the
Senate's Foreign Relations Com
mittee to the White House tomor
row.
A document prepared by Secrei
tary Lansing for transmission to
Germany will be submitted to the
committee.
This document will constitute an
indictment of Germany's subma
rine policy, each separate attack
since the Lusitania was sunk form
ing a part in the indictment.
FACTS PRESENTED.
Secretary Lansing laid before the
Cabinet toduy a collection of evidence
on which a statement of facts in the
case against Germany will be based.
The decision to submit this evtdens
and the communication to Get many be
fore the Senate Foreign Helutlons Com
mittee will be in lino with President
Wilson's desire to Inform Congress be
fore taking final action In the German
situation.
It Is the present plant to address a,
note to the German government reciting
that the list of submarine attacks shows
violation of pledger made to the United
States.
Tho Administration is convinced the
channel steamer Sussex was torpedoed.
Tho German denial of responsibility
falls to establish a defense In view of
Administration officials.
In fact, It Is believed that Germany's
Intended defenso practically amounts to
an assumption of guilt.
Additional Counts.
The other four cases of admitted sub
marine attack, involving destruction of
the Manchester Engineer, the English
man, Kaglo Point, and Berwlndvale,
form additional counts In the Indict
ment. The only loophole for escapo from the
situation that threatens severanco of
diplomatic relations Is tho German sug
gestion that the facts be submitted to
an International mixed commission.
Tho Administration previously has re
fused to consider any form of arbitra
tion. Nevertheless, Germany's sugges
tion must ho "vp 'to courtesy of con
sideration and reply.
hiorn illegal .ntlons the forth
coming note to Germany will brine the
long-expected showdown In the subma

Berlin Mails Sketches
Of Torpedoed Steamer
BERLIN, April U. Germany Is for
warding to the State Department nt
Weshlngton all the evidence she has in
her possession with respect to the Sus
sex. The foreign office handed to Ambassa
dor Gerard two pencil sketches of tho
steamer attacked by a German subma
rine In tho channtl on the same after
noon the Sussex was damaged. These
sketches were made by officers of tho
U-boat. Accompanying these sketches
was a copy of the photograph of tho
Sussex, printed In the London Graphic,
not at nil similar to tho steamer
pictured In I ho sketches.
This evidence u forwarded to Lon
don Tuesday in the embassy's mall
pouch. It was learned today and should
reach Washington within about ten
days. Germans express the belief that
President Wilson will take no decisive
action until there drawings are at hand.
The Berlin nwppahers genernlly ap
plaud the German note, unci renew their
expressions of hope for a satisfactory
settlement of the new difficulties be
twtcn the two countries. Count von

'America thinks It opportune to aim

Confessions Made by Three Men
Seized Yesterday May.Lead
to More Arrests.
NEW TOnK. April H.-Confesslon
made to the police today by Wtlhelm
Paradise, George Praedal, and Carl
Schmidt, German bomb plotters, arrest
ed yestciday, have resulted In a search
for a score or more of men who
actually placed Incendiary bombs on
ships of (ho allied nations In tho gi
gantic conspiracy just uncovered.
Copt. Charles von tflelst. a relative
of tho lato Gorman chancellor. Pnnce
Bismarck, nnd brother-in-law of General
von Brossen. Is another man caught In
the police net.
bo anxious were tho ringleaders of
tho plot to bo auro of the vessels orl
which bombs wero placed that ' tho
work was never Intrusted to- ono man,
tho police say. Two, and more often
thiee, vuro assigned to tho work.
The three men confessed today that
in work extending over almost a year's
tlmo they made approximately 300
bombs. They told tho pollco that ton
to twelve bombs to each vessel woo
considered nhout the right number by
the ringleaders.
This tallies roughly with the police
check up of thirty-three fires on allied
shlpi at sea. Tho bombmakers received
$14 a week for their labor.
Wth tho hunt for Dr. Walter T.
Scheele. head of the Now Jersey Agri
cultural nnd Chemical Company, tho
concern which placed tho acid In tho
bombs, search Is also being made
through all of his accounts for trail
of the higher ups.
Hope Im expressed that somewhere In
tho accounts a record will bo shown
establishing his connection directly.
German Officials May
Be Involved in Plots
German officials In Now York, Instead
of a supposed "rich German" mentioned
in press re orts, may bo involved in the
plot to blow up ships unearthed In New
York, It wub lenrned today.
The Investigation being conducted by
tho Now Yofk police In connection with
Department nf Justice nnri nuinm.
agents also will result In tho arrest of
Bicnmsmp men alleged 10 nave known
that bombs wore being made aboard In
terned steamers.
Tho storing of dynamtto aboard the
steumers for the purposo of making
bombs also will lead to arrests. State
laws forbid such storage of explosives.
"It 1h truo thu plots were engineered
by agencies which hnd ample funds be
hind them," an official said today. "It
Is not truo that nny Indlvidunl furnished
the money,"
The Investigation led today to New
Orleans. Tho "bomb squad" discovered
at New York sent ngents to New Or
leans to put bombs aboard cnomj shins
nnd perhaps mny have sent ngents to
ether rltlcs, Including Baltimore.
The Department of Justlco will lay
the cases befoie the Federal as well as

DENY NEW TROOP ORDERS
Secretary Lansing Cannot Say
When Reply to First Chief Is
to Be Sent.
General Carranza's demand for the
wltlMrnwiil nf the American forces from
Mexico Is to be Ignored. I
This decision was arrived at today at a
meeting of the Cabinet, which was prob
ably one of the most Important In the
history of the country.
Threatened with grave perils from
decided to stand squarely by the rights i
of American citizens and the sanctity
of American honor. An hi Cabinet, to
a man, Is said to stand with him.
For twe hours, while the corridors
outs'de the Cabinet room swarmed with
men waiting to her the decisions, the
President and his advisers sat behind
closed doors.
No Change in Poller.
That the meeting was to be devoted
exclusively to the two great problems
faclnc the Administration was Indi
cated by the fact thsttho only two
members who. went to the meeting arm
ed) with portfolios of papers were Sec
retary of State Lansing and Secretary
of War Baker.
Both Secretary Lansing and Secretary
of War Baker emphatically stated after
the meeting that no change of policy
had been decided upon; that the Ameri
can expedition will continue Its pursuit
of ilia.
It was apparent that many of the of
nclala fully comprehended that a refusal
to comply with Cnrranra's demands
might m;an war between the two coun
tries. At the same time two facta stood
out as a result of the meeting.
Secretary Lansing declared that he
could not say when the United btatcs
would repl to jthe formal note from
Carranza and denied that Special
Agent Jnmea Llnd Rodgers, of the Stete
Department, at Queretaro had been In
structed to confer with Carranza in an
effort to tach an nmlcablo understand
ing On the other hand, Secretary Baker,
whllo declaring that no instructions to
General Funston directing him to with
draw the expedition had boen sent or
were In contemplation, nevertheless,
h added thai no orders had been sent
for additional troops to be sent to the
bordct.
"Mv tBtfmint nf last nleht that
Goner A 1 Funston had been Instructed t&
tako all necessary steps for tne pro
tection of our troops still stands," said
Secretary Baker.
"Tho necessities of the situation are
the only limit to the authority which
General Funston may exercise."
No Guard Decision.
The Cabinet apparently reached no
decision to call out the national guard
for service on the border. Tho members
of the Cabinet seem to be of the same
oi inlon as tho Secretary, that the
reports concerning the fighting In Pnr
ral had been exaggerated in the official
Mexican reports, .
becrctary Baker, nevertheless, ap
pearco concerned as to the safety'of the
troops and worried over tho absence f
Information from Pershing.
At the close of the Cabinet meeting
ho Inquired eagerly whether any treah
dispatches had heen received at the
War Department' from General Fun
ston, who was Instructed to send as
quickly ns possible all obtainable de
tails regarding the Parral Incident.

KL PASO. Tex.. April 14. United
Utates troops n round Ptarral are facing
a critical situation, reports received
here todny Indicate.
A supposedly Vllllsta band, defeated
by the American troops at Tnw. last
Monday, retreated toward Parral, an
ortlcial Mexican report stated. The
victorious American cavnfry pursued,
but found sentiment against them nt a
.high pitch In Parral. The clash between
the Mexican mob and the American
detachment followed on Wednesday.
Iteporta are also received of Vllllstas
or Independent bandits between the
American force and 'the Ban Antonio
(Mexico) base of the United States ex
pedition. One party of 200 bandits at
tacked a cattle train only three miles
from Parral. This force may Iiavo boen

American troops In the streets of Par
ral. other bandit forces In that vicinity
t'oleated the Cnrranza garrison at Pilar
de Cochos, driving them back on Parral.
i he uc tnctn troops at 101 Valle also
wero beaten by the guerrillas.
'ihc question wneiher the Carranza
soldiers took part In tho lighting against
the Americans In Parral is recorded as
tho most Important phase to be cleared1
up in tne nwnitea official aaviccs irom
urignaier uenerai j'ersning.
Tho Mcxlcnnticcount. posted In Juarex
today, stated that civilians attacked J
the United Ktntea troops who entered
Parral by mistake No -mention was
made of any deaths or Inlury to Mexi
cans, the Carranza officials evidently
seeking to proent 111 feeling among
tho Juarex soldiers ,
Tho Juarez garrlscn is considered
strongly ontl-Anicilcin.

NO NEWS RECEIVED
OF SOLDIERS SINCE
BATTLE 2 DAYS AGO
Gravest Concern Felt Here Over Cutting Off
Of Communication With 150 Men Who
Were in Engagement With Carranzista
Mob at Parral Wednesday. -
Not one word had been heard up to 2 o'clock" this
afternoon from the, 150 American ' soldiers who were
treacherously attacked by Mexican mobs in the town of
Pirral on Wednesday afternoon.
Two full days after the fight, during which the Car
ry nza officials declare many Mexicans and at least one
American were killed, the War Department is still with
out the slightest information except such as has come
through Mexican sources.
Frantic efforts are being made to reach the little band
of Americans far to the south of Pershing's main army to
find out just what happened. The field wireless equip
ment is being pushed to its utmost limit and couriers are
It 1 I I 11 I I 4 ""
i racing inrougn Mexican territory to get in toucn witn tne
imen who were under fire.
oravebi, concern i& ieu roiyyie saieiy oi inebq men.
This concern is increased by the statement in Carranzi's
message of yesterday that "fighting was renewed at night."
The earlier dispatches yesterday all referred to the
fight on Wednesday afternoon. It is feared the Americans
may have been surprised and overwhelmed if there was
more fighting after dark.
ORDER "GET VILLA" STANDS.
While the army was trying to get to the men who
were in the fight, the Cabinet in session here took up the
whole Mexican situation, in the light of the latest develop
ments, and reached the conclusion that there should be no
change for the present in the plans of the United States.
The order still in effect is to "Get Villa." Administra
tion circlts are stirred by the news from Mexico and the
opinion at the Capitol and elsewhere is that the outlook is
so serious that the developments of any hour might precip
itate a real war.
General Pershing, commanding the expeditionary
forces, has not been heard from for four days. Staff offi
cers fear that through inability to communicate with Per
shing, 'General Funston may not be able to warn him of
the perilous position of the cavalry detachment at Parral.
FEAR LINES ARE CUT.
Officials fear that General Pershing's wireless equip
ment has been destroyed and his telegraph lines cut. There
are fears also that the line of communication between
Pershing's base and Colonel Dodd's advance column of
cavalry has been cut. '
When Secretary Baker went to the Cabinet meeting
today the only report on the Mexican situation at the War
Department was a telegram from General Funston stating
his inability to communicate with General Pershing.
General Funston has been directed to take all the
necessary steps to protect the soldiers at Parral and allay
further trouble.
He was unable to move in this direction because he
was out of communication with the forces in' the field.
It is assumed that General Funston will send aviators
in along the line of communication to report the situation
to him.
Army officers fear that the killing of Mexican civilians
at Parral by American cavalry defending themselves from
attack may inflame the Mexican people and encourage a
general uprising against the American troops.
Staff officers are confident that Pershing's army can
fight its way out of Mexico no matter what the odds may
be against it. Thev realize, however, that this could only
be accomplished afther a heavy loss of life on the Ameri
can side.
They fear particularly for the safetv of-the advance
cavalry column now 350 to 400 miles into the interior of
