Children's feet should be carefully guarded
against imperfections. After foot blemishes ap
pear, it is mighty hard to remove them.
No other part of a child's body is deprived
of freedom except the foot, and the shapeliness
of a matured foot depends almost entirely upon
the judgment used in selecting shoes that
properly shape the foot as it grows.
The sound reasoning of this statement is
apparent to every mother—the answer is:

They are the result of scientific study of
children's shoe requirements—and its mechanical
fulfillment in the most modern children's shoe

EARLY DAY HISTORY.
The Old Settlers are Requested to
Give Assistance in Making a
Reliable Book.
To Mr. E. W. Owens, belongs the
credit of my being able to present the
History of Pleasant Township. He
generously volunteered to help write
a history of the Township of which
he was one of the first, if not the very
first to settle and being associated
with the affairs of the neighborhood
for so many years.
The details and much personal mat
ters of his written History and pro
gress of that town could not be taken
in as early History, hence it was be
forehand agreed that I should revise
his Sketch, take out what I thought
there was not room for or public in
terest lu an early History of Lincoln
County and add to such informations
as I had or could get, besides the
statistics, which I have taken from
the records and such other papers
that I have.
Now the publishing of this, at this
time, is for the purpose to
awaken public interest in getting
from each town, a similar history as
outlined by this sample. There is no
money for doing this work for any one,
for even the publishing this, but it is
patriotic of the newspapers of the
nounty seat to generously act in this
matter. Let me appeal to township
members of the Old Settlers Associa
tion, and to the correspondents of the
Press in each township to interview
the old settlers, as to events and Map
pings of early days, they are the only
ones who can give it. This Historical
Sketch, will be of service in asking
questions for information and kindly
report such matters to me and furth
er it is almost necessary to have the
names and locations of the earliest set
tlers, which I have supplied to most
members of the Historical Committee
and will supply to any one who will
work for this history, by dropping me
a postal, or sending me word as I ab
stracted the whol$, county for this
purpose. I have bad early histories
sent me for Inspection from counties
in several states, and think I have an
idea of what would be a comprehen
sive and popular history for this coun
ty, Would be In a fair shape, if some
help Is had in each township, like Mr.
Owens done for Pleasant.

PLEASANT TOWNS HI P.
Township 96, range 50 is bounded
by Norway on the east, Lincoln on
the north, Brooklyn on the west and
Prairie township and Union county
on the south.
The surface is quite deveralfied,
from a level on the west to a rolling
surface in the eastern part, which
forms the divide between the Brule
and Saddle creeks. The hilly tract,
embraces about 3 sections. There is a
low smooth strip of land stooping
slightly towards Brule creek and
hence the name Pleasant Valley was
suggested by the first settlers for a
name for the school district and ac
cepted by common consent, and in
turn, when the township was organiz
ed, was perfected to Pleasant twp
In March 1873 the township consist
ed of
a
barren prairie, not a shanty
nor habitation could be seen by E W.
Owens, who settled on section 4. But
these conditions were not long to so
remain. The Dakota Southern R. R.
had been just built to Elk Point. Ver

One of the most Indlspenslble ne
cessity while the pioneers were break
ing the prairie was a Blacksmith and
fortunately James Larson was the
faithful blacksmith, building a shop
on Sec 8, and doing business until
Beresford was founded. In 1874, the
Grasshoppers took the little crops
that were growing, and many perdict
ed that this country would be always
a filleted with these pests and quite a
number left, selling what little they
bad and some secured title to their
lands or rellngulshed at from $25 to
$200 for quarter section. In 1875
crops were good and the hopes of the
settlers revived. But in 1876 the hop
pers returned and hall also destroyed
crops. Mr. Owens reports that of 26
acres, he got 67 bushels of wheat and
of the poorest quality.
When Fredolin Kundert settled on
Sec. 9 he dug a well by the use of the
spade and Mrs. Kundert pulled up the
dirt and after going down 40 ft. had to
give it up and no water. Not only
the hardship for the pioneers after
getting here, but also the hardships
encountered on the way of getting
here. The following account of the
journey of S. M. Woodward and fam
ily as given by his son, Joseph Wood
ward of Beresford, gives a striking
idea of what bad to be contented
with. "We started from Hardin Co.,
Iowa In the spring of 1873 by oxteams,
bridges were washed away and it
rained nearly every day. We had to
swim the teams In order to cross
streams, we could make only 6 or 0
miles some days. This family consist
ed of S. M. Woodward and wife,
Emma R, William H, Clarlnda A,
Mathilda A, Joseph W, Fannie M.
Nellie M, Wallace S, Laura B, Louis
C. and Arthur C. Six daughters and
five sons, Indeed a worthy aquisltion
to a new community. They settled on
Sec. 2. Now this being the panic
year, wheat sold for 29c per bushel
and hogs at $1.80 per Cwt.

June, many settlers arrived bringing
with them a little live stock and some
farm implements.
The first American settlers were
principally from Iowa, and what
formed an important part of the popu
lation were the Swiss Colony from
New Glarus, Wis. A Danish settle
ment was made in the west part, and
a sprinkling of Norwegians in various
parts of the township.
The first ownership of land, that Is
who proved up on government land,
was Mary Garwood, Gilbert P. Ben
nett and Mary Bennett in 1873. Plat
Vail, Gabriel Voyen, W. Clark, Anne
Knudson and Silas Rohr, in 1874.
During the summer of '73 R. F. Ben
nett, Mathias 96hmld and Fredolin
Kundert, were the first to erect farm
dwelling houses, but some of them re
mained unplastered for 2 or 3 years,
for the lack of means.
