SUBMARINE
AGAIN AVERTED
Feeling At Washington That No Dras-
tic Action Will Be Taken
President Will Deal
Washington, April 13. President
Wilson still remains undecided as to
what action he will take In the sub
marine crisis with Germany. The
probability that he -will resort to an
other note as a means, of dealing with
the situation In a comprehensive man
ner has greatly Increased. There is
a distinct feeling that no drastic ac
tion will be taken by the United
States and that the crisis is agnlu
safely passed.
Secretary Lansing declined to af
Arm or deny tho report that another
note was in contemplation. It is un
derstood, however, that ho has al
ready gathered accumulative evidence
tending to show that recent subma
rine attacks have jeopardized Ameri
can lives, and that in addition ho will
ecdeavor to obtain from Berlin a
promise that merchantmen operating
near the Prltish Isles will not be sunk
without warning. In the negotiations
between Secretary Lansing and Count
Von Denittorff, the German ambassa
dor, on the recent Arabic case. Mr.
Lansing pressed the point of obtain
ing the same guarantees for mer
chantmen operating In the British
war zone as Germany conceded for
freighters operating in the Mediterra
nean. Germany refused. Secretary
Lansing is understood to believe that
this point should now be emphasized,
but, according to the German em
bassy, the Imperial government will
make no concessions along this line
ntll Gnat Britain modifies the
blockade.

ive
Gerard. -
Germany denies all blame in con
nection with the explosion on tho
channel steamer Sussex, but admits
that German submarines sank tho
Trolghters Englishman, Manchester
Engineer, Eagle Point and Berwin
dale. These sinkings are defended
as having been legitimate and the
suggestion is made to refer them to
Tho Hague In case this "legality" Is
Oisputed by the United States gov
ernment Germany does hot understand how
the United States can legally object
to submarine operations aimed at
freighters in the war zone which are
being used to bring supplies or mu
nitions to the enemy. Germany's
pledge not to sink liners without
warning any way is not held to apply
to freighters where there are presum
iibjy no Americans aboard. There, are
no passengers on these ships, and If
Ameilcan3 happened to be among the
crew they would be to all intents and
purposes in the services of the en
emy. The conclusion drawn by the for
eign office is that the Sussex, like
the British steamer Tubltanla, struck
8 British mine. The foreign office ex
pects the United States will be en
tirely satisfied with the German ex
planation. GERMANS EMPLOY

French Repel Infantry Attacks
Near Le Mort Homme.
Paris, April 13. The Germans at
tacked the French positions In the
Bols des Caurettee, Just west of Cu
inlerres and between that village and
Lt. Mort Homme. Flaming liquids
were usd as a cover for the attack,
but the Cermaus were repulsed.
This was the only infantry action
ii' the Verdhn sector in the courso
of the" day, although German guns
bombarded the French lines on the
west sido of the river, particularly
Hill 304, the region of Esnes and Lo
Mort Homme constantly, and also
concentrated heavy fire on tho Dounu-c.ont-Vaux
sector. To these bombard
ments the French artillery replied
with vigor.
The attack on the eastern bank of
the Meuse is regarded by French mil
itary writers as intended only to oc
cupy the attention of the French
while the Germans are bringing up
further reinforcements, in order to
continue the assaults agnlnst Le Mort
Homme, Hill 304 and the other ob
stacles confronting them on the west

British Note on Seizure o! Pas

TO CONTINUE NEGOTIATIONS
No Precedent, In Secretary Lansing's
Opinion, Which Would Justify the
Seizure On the Ground That the
Men Had Engaged In Plots In the
Far East Great Britain's Conten
tion. Washington, April 13. Great Bri
tain's note on tho seizure of thirty
eight Austrlans, Germans and Tnrks
from the American steamer China,
Bear Shanghai, does not close the
case to the satisfaction of the United
States.
It was said at the state department
tuat tne seizures probably would be
the subject of further correspondence
coon. Secretary Lansing is oZ the
opinion that there Is no precedent
which would uphold Great Britain's
ettempt to Justify the seizure on the
ground that tho men had engaged In
plots In the far east, and were on
their way to Manila to continue their
efforts against the allies.
The position of the United States is
ttat subjects of a belligerent govern
ment may not bo removed from an
American vessel on the high seas
oven though they properly may be
considered military persons but not
actually members of the armed forces.
The note was made public by the
state department It follows the line
of argument previously indicated, and
contends that the persons were not
clothed with the immunity which
would attach to enemy subjects who
merely were traveling.
Great Britain alleges that the pris
oners were ensaged for some time
past In the collection and transmls.
Blon of arms and ammunition, both
for clandestine transmission to India
end, if possible, for the arming of a
ship to play the part of a far eastern
Moewe, and were bound for Manila
to continue their work, having been
exposed to the British authorities at
Shanghai.
The neutrality of the United States
would have been compromised, the
note contends, had the prisoners per
formed the acts they had In contem
plation. Their acts. It Is contended,
deprived them of protection from the
American flag, under which they were
sailing.
The British government argues that
the removals were perfectly Justified
r.nd trusts that the United States will
not feel further disposed to contend
the action.

uation. EI Paso, Tex., April 13. Mllltla or
ome states, probably those of tho
southwest, will have to be summoned
for Mexican duty unless the United
States army retires from Mexico or
secures the use of the Mexican rail
ways for transporting all supplies, ac
cording to information in military cir
cles on the border.
With the information received here
from the bouth that General Per
shing's advance had proceeded south,
of Parral in its hunt for Pancho Villa
and his bandits, it was established la
the minds of aray men that ae must.
have more forces in a short time or
retire from the field. The line of
communication is strung out now for
almost SOU miles, over some of the
most uncertain country on the conti
nent, and the small number of troops
in the expedition makes it impossiblo
to much longer maintain It in safety.
That General Pershing takes little
stock in the circumstantial stories
told by the natives of the death of thn
bandit leader is evidenced by his ac
tivity In pressing his forces south
after the fleeing band, last known to
be In the company of Villa himself.
The exact location of these troops
was not given, but a message abso
lutely authentic said they were south,
of Parral This message came from
the same sources as one which report
