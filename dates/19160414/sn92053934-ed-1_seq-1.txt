German War Report.
Berlin, April 14, (via London, S:50
p. m.i The official statement given
out today at tiie German army head
quarters says:
"Western theatre:
"Apart from occasional lively artil
lery duels In the region of the Metise
there is nothing to report.
"Eastern Theatre:
"Minor enemy advances in the re
gion of Garbunowka, northwest of
Dvinsk, south of Narocz lake and on
the Servitche river, north of Zirin,
were repulsed with sanguinary losses.
"Balkan theatre: East of the A'ar

London, April 34, (2:2$ p. m.) De
feat of the Turkish forces in Mesopo
tamia by Vau British was reported of
ficially. In an engagement on the Ti
gris the Turks w-ere driven back from
one and one-half to three miles.
The announcement of the British
victory came at a time when the pub
lic was beginning to fear efforts to re
lieve the force of General Townsend
at Kut-El-Amara were doomed to
failure, owing to the check suffered by
the relieving army a few days ago and
the difficulties brought about by
floods.
Many military writers in England
believed the floods had made the relief
of General Townsend almost an im
potsibility but today's official report
shows that, instead of hindering the
British, the water has helped the for
ces of Lieutenant General Gorringe in
on? of the most difficult tasks under
taken by the British army. Each mile
the Turks are forced back makes the
British operations easier, for as they
approach Kut-El-Amara the Turks
are compelled to defend a wider front.
In view of today's news, therefore, the
prospects of rescuing the army at Kut- j
Ll-Amara is regarded as better than
It has been for tome time.

Washington, April 14. It was
indicated today that the next step
In the submarine crisis, probably
the sending to Germany of the
cumulative evidence which the
I'nited States contends shows vio
lations of Berlin's assurances, will
be taken within the next 48 hours.
Developments are expected to fol
low rapidly.
The president and the cabinet
are understood to have agreed that
the presentation of the facts shall
be accompanied by a detinite and
final demand for evidence of Ger
many's good faith and observance
of her guarantees but probably
will he accompanied by no time
limit which properly could be de
scribed as an ultimatum.
After a prolonged cabinet meet
ing today it was announced flint a
communication to Germany would
go forward as planned probably
within the next 43 hours. It was
said the case was complete with
out the affidavits which arrived to
day on the steamer St. Paul.
The plan to present the American
case with the accumulation of evi
dence that not the Sussex alone but
other ships as well have been de
stroyed in violation of Germany's
promises to the United States re
mained unchanged. With the state
ment of act will be a demand for evi
dence of Germany's good faith to make
good her assurances. Nothing In the
nature of a time limit will be attached,
it was understood.
The evidence collected by Secretary
Lansing was placed before the cabinet
today. Affidavits on the Sussex case,
which arrived on the steamer St. Paul
were not before the cabinet but it was
said other evidence was so complete
that they were entirely necessary to
the preparation of the case for the
I'nited States.
The president and the cabinet show
ed no disposition to let the Mexican
situation postpone action on the sub
marine question.
The administration considers the
German note practically shows that a
submarine attacked the Sussex.
Cabinet Discusses Question.
The cabinet discussed the submarine
and Mexican questions in great detail.
It was said no action would be taken
today on the submarine question but
it was indicated the final word of the
American government might go for
ward to Berlin tomorrow. Lacking of
ficial confirmation of reports of the
fight at Parral chief consideration was
given to Germany and it was under
stood the administration would center
attention on this issue, although Gen
eral Carranza's suggestion that Ameri
can troops be withdrawn will not be
slighted.
Jabinet members were unusually re

the course to be pursued toward Ger

NEWS OF PARRAL
BATTLE LJ
General Fnnston Employing Every
Means of Communication to Get
American Side of flash.
San Antonio, Tex., April 14. Gen
eral Funston was still endeavoring
early today to learn from General
Pershing the American side of the
story of the fight at Parral. Wireless,
field telegraph and every other avail
fable means of comiaunlcation have
been employed to? get to General
Pershing the Instructions to rush to
headquarters with all possible speed a
report cu the incident arM the meas
ure he has taken to relierVthe little
cavalry force that was forced to fight
for its life Wednesday night.
Unbroken silence on those subjects
was not taken at headquarters, how
ever, to mean that General Pershing
was unaware of the fight or that he
was not doing anything to assist the
cavalrymen.
General Funston and his staff offi
cers realized that General Pershing
must first receive from Parral thu
story of what occurred, and because
of his own location far to the front,
perhaps beyond the most advanced
wireless station, might have to use
couriers in getting the account of the
development of the past 4S hours back
to the border.
Secretary Baker's instructions had
not reached General Funston early to
day but already scouts were investigat
ing Carranza troop movements In
northern Mexico in that part of the I
country through which the line of com
munications extend and officers in
charge of detachments distributed
along the l:ne from Columbus to Casas
Granries had taken steps to guard
against attacks.
Any extensive movement of troops
along the line of the railroads, or the
dispatch of additional men into Mexico
will depend on the exact wording of
Secretary Baker's instructions and
upon the character of General Persh
ing's report.
No important change will be made
until General Pershing has communi
cated with headquarters.

Douglas, Ariz., April 14.
General Arnulfo Gomez was
..11. T. .1
still in Agua rrieta tms
morning awaiting orders
from General Alvaro Obre
gon, Mexican minister of
war, to lead his columns of
infantry and cavalry into
Chihuahua from Colon ia Mo
relos, Sonora.
General Pershing's Tamp at
Front, April 12, via aeroplane to
Chihuahua, April 13, via El Paso
Junction, April 14. About forty
mounted men, believed to be Villa
men or General Tarango's com
mand, attacked last night an ante,
mobile supply train and were driv
en off after a short fight. There
were no American casualties. One
Villa bandit was killed.
General Pershing moved his camp
south yesterday, penetrating far Into
Villa territory where he found num
erous constitutionalist detachments
under General Graza, who gave the
Americans a friendly greeting and co-;
operation. General Pershing traveled;
here in an automobile train of supply
trucks, which made a record breaking
trip.
The fight which occurred about 9
o'clock last night was several miles in
the rear of the automobiles carrying
General Pershing. It lasted about 20
minutes. When the bandits who tried
to capture one truck came up, the
Ameticans poured In five volleys
which ended the fight completely.
There were two attacks, the first a
slight one and directed against a for
ward truck. The last attack was a
rush against the rear trucks, during
which bullets flew against the auto
mobiles and poured through the bruan :
which covered the mesa.
The bandits seemed to think the cut
ting off of the rear truck would be
easy because some of them got within
a few feet of it before the Americans,
who were withholding their fire, start
ed shooting.
The American soldiers thought they
hit some of the bandits.
At the Constitutionalist camp within
a few miles of the scene of the fight
ing it was reported that three bandits
were killed during the first part of
the week. Lieutenant A. R. Christie
of the aero squadron, commanded the
men in the fight. The fight was over
too quickly for the men in the for
ward trucks to get into action.

ernment. General Gomez would be in
position to strike the line of American
communications at Casas Grandes.
Official advices giving details of the
fight at Parral, where a detachment of
