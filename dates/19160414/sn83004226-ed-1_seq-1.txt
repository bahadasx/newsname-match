CUYINQ THE COURT AT
PRE8ENT.
The April term of tlio Lawrence Cir
cuit Court lirfun Monday, Judge A. N.
Cisco presiding and attorney John M.
Waugli, representing the common
wealth. The first aut of the Judge wa
to call the Sheriff and hi deputies lie
fore him and administer the oath which
requires them, without four or favor, to
CI
summon solirr ana uiscreci mm um

Vhe next step was the Impaneling of.

delivering- his charge. This was very
forcibly and well delivered, addressed
to the big twelve and was listened to
by them and all Inside the court room
with profound attention. JudKe Cisco's
: first charge to tho icrand Jury of this
county was a very aide one and the one
given to the present icrand Jury was
no less plain and forcible. The JudKe
did not deal In generalities, but took
up the several offense which constl
tut felonies, one by one. telling the
Jurors In plain language what consti
tuted these various crimes, of course,
he directed their attention to the crime
of murder. : He sold they knew what
constituted murder and that he was
lad to 'know that since ills ftrst visit
to this county that heinous offense, to
his knowledge, bad not been commit
ted within the borders of this county
He alluded, however, and that very dis
tinctly, to the offense of shouting1 and
wounding with Intent to kill or strik
ing with a deadly 'weapon with Ih
, same dndly intent. He said to the Jury
to slit these cases, if any there were,
and when found beyond a reasonable
doubt thut any of these offens-s hud
been committed, to brine the perpetra
tor before him and ho would see that
they were duly tried.
Judiie Cisco then said that there were
other crimes fully as dark which were
against society and wonmuhnod and he
called special attention tu the Jury to
tho Investigation nf such cases ir with
in their knowledge or hearttiK such of
fenses had been committed. In this
manner, one by one, he took up the 'el
onlea and then Ui various misdemean
ors and urged a thoroiiKh Investigation
of any such violation of the law. He
held before them. In a very stroh nuui
ner, tho necessity of the punishment of
men who were too lasy to work a.id
had not .visible means of support, but
would In the dark hour of the night
break Into a man's house or store and
take that which the owner had acquir
ed by honest toll. He urged that the
Jury pay no attention to the requests
of those who had lost property like that
and who hud gotten It strain or hud
been paid for the loss, nor heed the re
quest that because nf such restitution
the perpetrator of the crime should not
m Indicted, but that If they found suf
ficient grounds to Indict any one for
stealing to promptly Indict him.
The grand Jury Is a body of more
than usual Intelligence, some or lliem
being- men of much experience as grand
Jurors and who know how to ferret out
offenses and brliiK the offenders Into
tho court. The following constitute the

Tho crowd attending Court Is very
large, a large number has been sum

out the entire week much business will
bo don. Tho criminal docket Is dark
with felonies, some of them being of
tho gravest nature.

Not much Is being said Just now
about the Baltimore & Ohio railroad

The engineering corps working down
the Levlsa fork from Shelby Is still en

The progress Is necessarily very slow
on this kind of work, which is said to
be a final survey. It will probably be
late in the summer when the party
reaches Louisa.
As to whether or not this line will be
built is mere conjecture, but there are
some facta well known that seem to
support the report that the line will be
built.

CONTEST IN THE COURTS ON
NEW JUDICIAL DISTRICT ACT.
It seems certain that the constitu
tionality of the new Judicial district
net will be tested In the Courts. Judge
Cisco and .Commonwealth's Attorney
Waugh will be active In the fight, -a
both are seriously affected by the In
defensible Hctinn of tht Ix-gialuture. If
the new law stands, Judge Cisco will
be forced to move from his established
home, which Is not ft pleasant or pro
fitable thing to do. In the case of the
Cotnmonwtalth's Attorney, which of
fice is dependent almost wholly upon
fees, the loss of Morgan county very
materially reduces the Income.
In the opinion of many good lawyers
the act Is unconstitutional.
CECIL GETS FIVE YEARS.

which place he ytas taken immediately.
The shortage Is said to be much larger
than at first reported.

CHURCH ATTENDANCE J
FAR BELOW POPULATIONS
In view of the near approach of Sun
day, May the 7th, which has been des
ignated and set apart for observance as
Oo-To-Sunday-School-Day, tho NEWS
feels Justified In saying a word or two
about going to church. It Is a lament
able fact and, at the same time a sad
commentary on the moral tone of our
people, that of the, let us say, 1600 In
habitants of Louisa, not 20 per cent of
them are regular in their attendance at
any church. Admitting that this 20
per cent, goes more or less regularly to
one of tho four churches In Louisa, we
are sorry to say that there are some
people In this community, and some of
these are of the gentler sex who from
year's end to year's end never go to
chun-h unless possibly on the rare in
stance of a funeral. Why this is so It
is hard to say. No man, no woman
was ever made worse by attending
evangelical services In any church. On
the contrary it Is Impossible to attend
such services In the right frame of mind
without a decided Improvement In one's
mental and moral nature. Such attend
ance Is uplifting, beneficial, and edify
ing. Not to go to church In this day
and age of tho world Is wrong. The
NEWS does not say that people who
do not ever go to church are not good.
but It does say, be they ever so good,
attendance at church will make the
best of us better. Parents should go. If
for nothing else to set a good example
for their children. No boy who passes
the forenoon or an hour or two of it In
the house of the Lord, was ever made
worse by this employment of his time.
A town where the sound of the call to
church is heard and obeyed by a ma.
Jority of Its citizens, young and old
never became notorious for Its wick
edness. On the contrary it is safe to
say that a town of full churches and
full Sunday schools will become noted
as a desirable place for residence. Let
us therefore heed the call to go to
church' and Sunday school on the 7th
of May next, letting that be the first
step in the Get-the-hublt direction and
keep in the way.
WAYNE COUNTY TO LET
ROAD CONTRACT 8ATURDAY.
Contract for extending the Piedmont
road In Wayne county from the bridge
across Twelvepole creek to Main-st
Coredo, will be let Saturday by the
county court, pursuant to a conference
with, the new1 Ceredo council. Negotia
tions leading .to award of the contract
have been In progress for some time
between the court and the municipal
authorities.
To build tho road from tho bridge
to connect if with a Ceredo street, it
will bo necessary to make a consider
able fill.
It Is part of the road leading from
Huntington to Ashland, and will ulti
mately be a part of the Ashland-Char
leston pike through Huntington.
MR. VANSANT WILL
NOT ENTER THE RACE
HAS RETIRED FROM ACTIVE POL-
ITICS AND IS NOT CANDIDATE
FOR CHAIRMAN.
Ashland, Ky April 10. Colonel Ru
fus H. Vansant to-day stated that the
report that he would be a candidate for
re-election for Chairman of the Dem
ocratic State and Executive Commit
tees was erroneous. :
Colonel Vansant was emphatic in his
assertions. He said that, while he great
ly appreciates the many requests from
Democrats from all over the state that
he make the race, he must decline be
cause of his health and for businesc
reasons. .
The decision not to make the race is
In conformity with Colonel Vunsant's
declaration made before the- last elec
tion that he had retired from active
politics. . .
FALSE REPORT ABOUT A
MARTIN COUNTY OIL WELL.
A report has been going the rounds
of the press recently that a valuable
oil well was drilled' in by a company
searching for gas in Martln-co., our
next door neighbor. We regret that
the truth forces us to dispel the very
pleasing story sent out by some news
paper correspondent in need of a topic
live enough to make an acceptable item
for the daily press. Tho well referred
to was absolutely dry no oil, no gas.

REPORT OF EASTERN KEN
TUCKY OIL DEVELOPMENT.
Barbourvllle, Ky, April 8. Some of
the best strikes of the year are re
ported from Kentucky petroleum fields
for the week, seven wells showing in
excess of fifty barrels each out of a to
tal of twelve new completions. Prin
cipal results were credited to the shal
low sand districts, the largest new pro
duction being credited to Estill county.
Tho feature strike. In that field started
out at seventy barrels. Two comple
tions made fifty barrels each. One
started out at forty barrels while four
producers yielding ten to fifteen bar
rels each were reported. Allen county
ran a close second In the week's re
turns, production being boosted by the
drilling of two new wells making fifty
barrels each.
In Southern Kentucky tho Wayne
county field contributed three new com
plelions to the week's showing, with a
new production of fifteen barrels. One
strike of ten barrels capacity was
made in Lawrence county. In the north
eastern district. A dry hole was the
only result In Morgan county.
The number of drilling rigs in op
eration now total more than fifty, scat
tered over fourteen districts. The Es
till and Allen districts contain the
greatest number of rigs, twenty being
in commission in Estill and twelve In
Allen.
Following the completion In Martin
county last month of a wildcat well
showing a production of fifty barrels
many leases are being taken up in that
end of the State, and a number of
wells will be drilled at once. This de
velopment will take place In a region
rich in gas production, but the recent
petroleum well is the first to be drill
ed.
WHAT MEANS THE SURVEY?
A strange crsw of civil engineers
were at work this morning in Ashland

cause of the survey.
It Is known, however, that the B. &
O. railway company Is doing consider
able surveying in this vicinity, and that
they are very anxious to get Into Ash
