AM Things for the Eest.
Every' hig is providential. In that
case, Providence has to answer for
very terrible things. Things, how
Bver, may seem terrible to us b-vjause
we know neither the beginning nor
the end of them. Everything is for
the best, otherwise the justice of God
would not bo satisfied. Arranged
From "On the Branch."
Detecting Presence of Alcohol.
A device consisting mainly of four
Welsbach lamps has been made use of
by a western physician for the pur
pose of demonstrating the amount of
alcohol in samples of various medi
cines. i
