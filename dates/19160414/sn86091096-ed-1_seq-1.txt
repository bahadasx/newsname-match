OLDHELD RECOVERS
STOLEN JEWELRY
Found in The Brush Near
^ Town.
-
Part of the loot which was taken
from the Oldfield Jewelry store two
months ago was discovered last
Saturday by Ernest Frey tag and
Leslie Stqvens, while they were
hunting their cows. They found
a sack beside the road just a
short distance from town
containing a quantity of sliverware,
such as knives, forks, spoons and a
few toilet articles, all plaited ware.
Apparently those who committed
the robbery had taken everything
to this spot and selected the pieces
they wished, throwing the rest in
* the brush. The sack and contents
were in very good condition. The
plaited tableware was in such good
shape that Mr^Oldfield says with a
little polishing it will be as good as
new. This speaks well for the
grade of silver he handles if it can
stand two months of outdoor life
during the kind of weather we have
had this spring and winter.

Villa in Mountains
It is reported that Villa has re
treated to the mountains and that
he-is seriously wounded. His band
has decreased until it is now esti
mated to number less than one
hundred and fifty men. Their
equipment is very meagre and they
are almost destitute.
Neither the state nor war de
partment have had any further in
formation regarding rumors of
Villa's death. The report was
scouted in all official quarters as a
futile hoax to gain time for Villa.
Infernal Machine Found
A piece of steel about six inches
square and a half inch thick with
bolts about three quarters of an
inch in diameter screwed through
^y'ach corner, was found in the old
oarn near McCrea's place, Thurs
day. The steel had a slot cut
through the middle about an inch
and a half wide and three inches
long. This slot could be fitted
over the knob of a safe and when
the bolts were tightened it would
pull the knob out of the safe.
The marks on the postoffice safe
correspond to the four bolts in the
steel so that there is no doubt that
the safe robbers used this little
machine to open the safe door.
When the knob was pulled out it
left a hole through which the nitro
glycerine might be poured.
Firm Changes Hands
Tom McDowell purchased the
pool hall and barber shop formerly
owned by Harry Abrams. The deal
was made last Friday. Mr. Mc
Dowell will continue both places of
business at their present respective
locations. He has put in a stock of
cigars and tobacco and will run a
thoroughly up-to-date business.

Boy Scouts Entertain
Saturday evening the Boy Scouts
entertained the Camp Fire Girls at
the Scouts' club room. About
twenty of the Camp Fire Girls, in
cluding Mrs. A. W. Patton, and
eighteen Boy Scouts with their
Scout Master, Walter McCrea, were
present.
A very enjoyable evening was
by the young folks playing games.
Refreshments consisting of ice
cream and cake were served.
FIRST MEETING
OF W. C. T. (I.
Held Wednesday Afternoon
at Mrs. Walkers.
The first meeting of the W. C. T.
U. since the organization March 29,
was held at the home of Mrs. Norris
Walker Wednesday afternoon. The
local W. C. T. U. has a member
ship of sixteen members with Mrs.
H. W. Best as President; Mrs. Mina
French, Vice President; Mrs. Norris
Walker, Secretary; Mrs. Sarah
Riggin, Treasurer.
It was decided to hold a medal
contest which shall consist of recita
tions and essays. This will take
place in June. The different lines
of work which the organization
shall take up during the coming
year were discussed, one of which
was the enforcing of the law in re
gard to the selling of tobacco to
minors. Also the enforcing of the
prohibition law.
The members adjourned to meet
with Mrs. Plummer on May 10th.
Auto Show
More than 2000 automobiles
illuminated and decorated and
parading the streets of Spokane will
mark the opening of the annual
Spokane Auto Show, May 10 to 16.
Every type of pleasure motor car
manufactured in the United States
will be represented in the parade,
and the same wide range of differ
ent makes will then be displayed at
the Davenport Hotel.
The arrangements committee of
the show has arranged a number
of "stunts" for the benefit of visi
tors and local amusement seekers.
One of these will be the hill climb
ing contest on Monroe street hill,
and another will be an economy test
to determine what make of car can
travel the farthest on a pint or
quart of gasoline.
SIEE CDICKERS B OBBED KERD RiCK POST OFFIGE
$1000 Worth of Stamps and $150 in Cash Stolen — Meat
. Market of N. B. Long Entered.
The safe in the Kendriok post
office was blown open Monday
morning sometime between three
and four o'clock. Cash to the
amount of $150 was taken and
stamps amounting to $1,000 were
also taken but afterwards found.
The safe crackers gained entrance
by means of a pass key and once
inside the office could take their own
time to accomplish the work. It
was a neat job of burglary in one
respect, but the fact that it took
five shots of nitro glycerine to blow
open the safe door, might lead one
to suppose that the men were some
what lacking in experience. They
had an unlimited amount of nerve,
however, and didn't seem to care
how much noise they made. Some
of the guests at the Guy Hotel were
awakened by the first explosion.
They could hear the men talking
and also hear them chopping at the
safe door.
Up to the present time no clue
has been discovered as to the indent
ity of the robbers. The rain Sun
day night blotted out all tracks that
might have assisted the authorities
in determining which direction the
men had taken.
Donald McCrea found the
stamps Monday afternoon while on
his way to school. They were hid
den under a culvert in the east end
of town. About eleven dollars
worth were missing.
Postoffice Inspector Fullinwinder
at Spokane was notified that the
robbery had occurred and he imme
diately notified the U. S. officials
throughout the northwest. Secret
service men were put on the case
and though it may take time to
catch the robbers the probabilities
are that they will eventually be
apprehended. It is said that only
Tom Byrne had quite a round-up
with a disgruntled hog Thursday
morning. A number of stitches
were taken to close the gashes in
his leg that were made by the hog's
tusks.
John Stevens, son of A. P. Stevens,
fell from the barn and broke his
arm yesterday.
Another result of Dr. Smith's
energy is a bunch of shade trees in
front of the manse and church.
There are twenty-three in all and
most of them are large enough to
furnish some shade thiseummer.
one half of one percent of the men
who burglarize a U. S. postoffice
get away.
The sheriff was also notified and
he sent word to all the neighbor
ing tqwns to be on the lookout for
the robbers. Sheriff Campbell and
Deputy Sheriff Hall were in Ken
drick working on the case and al
though there were no clues left, it
is thought the chances for escape
are small.
The transfer of the postoffice from
Harry Stanton to J. F. Brown, the
newly appointed postmaster, was to
have taken place Monday morning
but owing to the fact of the robbery
the final transfer was not completed
until late in the afternoon. New
reports and transfer accounts had
to be made out and the investiga
tions by the postal inspector re
quired several hours.
It is thought that before entering
the postoffice the burglars attempted
to rob the safe in N. B. Long &
Son's meat market. The combi
nation had been twisted off with a
pipe wrench but the safe was not
opened. A bank pass book on the
cash register probably saved the
safe from being blown up. After
twisting the combination off, the
robbers probably noticed the bank
book and finding that the firm had
made a deposit Saturday night,
thought it hardly worth while to
finish the job. As it happened there
was just ten cents in cash in the
safe.
The tools which were used to
open the safe were taken from the
Northern Pacific pumphouse. Much
the same methods of work were
used by the men who cracked the
Kendrick Store Co.'s safe last fall
and it is possible that the same gang
pulled off both jobs.
Mrs. Mina French departed for
Grandforks, N. Dakota, to stay a
part of the summer with her son,
Dr. French.
Mrs. Jack Odern and little daugh
ter, Dorothy, of Juliaetta spent
Thursday in Kendrick with Mrs.
Odem's parents.
Mr. and Mrs. Lee Davis of South
wick. were passengers to Lewiston,
Thursday. »
Neal Durbin, who has been work
ing in the mines at Wallace, Idaho,
arrived here Thursday to visit a
short time with his parents.
New Hardware Store
Kendrick will soon have another
hardware store. Mr. Walter Mc
Crea, one of the best known busi
ness men in this part of the country,
will be the manager of the new
company. A large stock of hard
ware and implements has already
been ordered so that it is only a
question of a few days until the
new firm will be ready for business
The McCrea building, formerly
occupied by the McCrea Hardware
Co., is being repaired to receive the
new stock of hardware.
WELSH SIBGEBS
PLEASE AUDIENCE
Delightful Program Given on
Tuesday Evening.
One of the musical treats of the
season was the concert given Tues
day night by the Royal Gwent Male
Singers. The audience, though
small, was an appreciative one and
almost every number was encored.
The program consisted of solos,
duets, trios, quartets and chorus
singing. The numbers were good
but the chorus work was especially
beautiful. The "Hallelujah Cho
rus" from the great oratoria,
"Messiah," was a wonderful blend
ing of tones and was perhaps the
most popular number of the even
ing program.
This troop of singers is one of
two traveling choruses from Wales
The other one started to tour Africa
but was compelled to return home
on account of the European War
An interesting incident in connec
tion with the singers is the fact
that one of them was in the Titanic
disaster. He entertained a crowd
at the hotel after the show with
some graphic and "orrible" details
of the scene of the disaster.
White Pine School Burned
White Pine school house, situated
six miles northeast of Troy, burned
to the ground late Saturday night.
Miss Margaret Terry, the teacher,
was in Kendrick Monday but re
turned Tuesday on hearing that
school would begin at once in a log
cabin near where the old school
house was located. There are yet
two months and a half before the
term expires.

Mrs. Wenzlaff Entertaines
Was It Charles?
At a meeting of the Stockholders
the Kendrick Rochdale Co., last
Saturday, it was definitely decided
erect an elevator having a capa- v
city of about 50,000 bushels. A
large number of the stockholders
were present and the necessary
money was raised to assure the
building of the elevator.
This action was taken by the
farmers to protect themselves
against the abnormal price of grain
sacks and to be prepared in the
event that the shortage of sacks
may become so great that they can
not be had at any price.
It is still a question as to whether
the building will be constructed of
steel or wood. Figures have been
made on both materials but no
conclusion has been reached as to
which will be used.
The elevator will be erected
between the two Rochdale ware
houses and to make the necessary
room, the lower end of the upper
warehouse will have to be torn
down.
The Camp Fire Girls are giving a
cake* sale Saturday, April 16th. The
sale is to be held in the Kendrick
Store starting at 10:00 A. M. The
proceeds will go toward the C. F.
G. organization. Everyone come
and bring your purses with you.
Last Saturday evening the C. F.
G. met at the church. They talked
over their business affairs and then
went to Barnum's Hall, where the
Boy Scouts gave them a party.
Everyone enjoyed the party that
was given to initiate the girls'
organization into Kendrick. They
thank the boys for the kindness
shown them.
Many hikes have been planned by
the girls, but on account of such
wet weather they have been post
poned. They expect to take some
hikes in the near future.
Tuesday afternoon Mrs. Wenzlaff
entertained at her home in honor of
her mother, Mrs. Gandy, who re
turns to Spokane soon, after a
winters stay in Kendrick.
Although the weather was stormy,
the house was made cozy by the
cheerful glow of the grate fire and
the shaded light of many candles.
The color scheme in pink and white
was tastefully carried out through
out the house and especially in the
appointments of the tea table.
Many guests called during the
afternoon.
Mrs. Wenzlaff was assisted by
Mrs. J. E. Hoyt at the tea table.
Mrs. W. M. McCrea and Miss Luella
Hoyt added to the interest of the
occasion by playing many pleasing
selections on the piano.
Miss Harriet Wenzlaff entertained
at a small dinner party in the even
ing, the occasion being her fourth
birthday.
The following paragraph was
clipped from the Star-Mirror:
It was learned that roomers in the
Guy hotel heard explosions about
3 o'clock Monday morning and that
a young man in the hotel arose to
see what the noise was about. Sus
pecting burglars, in hearing a noise
in the hallway of the hotel, he
rushed back to his room and crawled
beneath his bed.
