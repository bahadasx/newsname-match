BAILEY DEFEATED.
Mr. Wm. H. Bailey, justice of the
peace at Buxton, Iowa, and one of the
active young republican workers of
that town, was the only candidate for
delegate from Iowa to the national
republican convention, was defeated
at the state wide primary held last
Monday, to our sorrow. It does seem
that when the republican party wants
active workers to help organize they
come to the colored people, but when
good and efficient candidates apply for
an elective office, which they have a
right to and are justly entitled to,
they are usually defeated. Mr. Bailey
is one of the strong men of Buxton,
young and active. And we present
his name as a candidate for the legis
lature from Monroe county iand hope
that he will file his nomination papers
and we will do all in our power to get
the nomination for him and his elec
tion to the legislature.
AMONG THE CANDIDATES.
We note from circulars and several
newspapers announcements that our
good friend, Henry E. Sampson, is a
candidate for attorney general. Mr.
Sampson is the present assistant at
torney general of Iowa and a lawyer
of much ability. Look for his an
nouncement later.
The present attorney general, Cos
son, is a v.ery strong candidate for
governor of Iowa. I have known Mr.
Cosson for a number of years and
recognize him of great strength and
character. He is organizing in every
county in the state, and his friends
expect that he will be the nominee.
Lieutenant Governor Harding of
Sioux City is also another candidate
for governor and he and his friends
are organizing in every part of Iowa.
They insist that he should be'the log
ical successor to Governor £laike.
Mr. H. M. Havner, a young attorney
fro mMarengo, is a strong candidate
for attorney general. Mr. Havner is
one of the ablest lawyers in the state
of Iowa, and with experience and by
virtue of his age and practice would,
if elected, make an efficient attorney
general. He is a true friend of hu
manity and will treat all classes fpir.

ALLEN FOR GOVERNOR.
Senator J. H. Allen, of Pocahontas
county, candidate for governor, is of
Quaker parentage and he has been
one of the best friends that the col
ored man has ever had. His grand
father belonged to the underground
railroad nf abolition days and helped
many a fugitive from the southland
to reach the hope of the north, where
there was safety. .When a boy Sena
tor Allen would listen by the hour to
the interesting tale of the grandfath
er how hey would hide the colored
fugitives during the day and then
trabel at night. Those were interest
ing days and of course as a result nf
his abolitionist ancestry Senator Al
len has in his Veins the same blood
that enthused to help the colored peo
ple. He is now being largely support
ed by the colored voters of Iowa and
this is the basic reason.

HEALTH BINTS.
A. J. Booker, M. D.
'Do you know?
That the best things in the world
cannot be bought with money Take
for instance, love, friendship, health,
happiness, honor and a quiet con
science.
That doctors do not cure you they
only aid nature, and when you think
you are fooling the doctor, if he really
has given the right advice, you are
deceiving yourself?
That sincerity of purpose and right
dealing are as sure to bring success
as the sun shines?
That anger and hatred are as cer
tainly poisonous as deadly drugs?
That people who are true and hon
est seldom waste time assuring folks
of their virtue?
That people claim that the Lord
took their babies or relatives when
they were sent to death by ignorance
and carelessness?
That the employment of time Is
what largely makes the difference in
men?
That there is a vast difference be
tween belonging to church and being
a Christian?
That fresh air will do as much or
more than medicine? And that it is
foolish to take a tonic simply because
spring comes?
That gossipers are usually liars and
draw on their imaginations to make
the thing interesting and that they
talk about you the same as any one
else?
That the liver is one of the best
crutches an ignorant doctor has to
fool the people with, and that all hard
vomiting will cause bile to appear?
That Christianity is the most liv
able of religions and the man or
woman who tells you that it is not
practical altogether is a non-believer
That most of the people we meet
have some mighty fine traits the rea
son we do not find the good is because
we do not want to
That the reason people take so
much interest in babies is because
while they are uncertain quantities
they represent infinite possibilities?
That most people are satisfied to
fool their friends and neighbors and
forget al About God and the future
And that we are yery foolish to ex
pect^unishment to follow 'directly
,f
THE BYSTANDER
after transgression and that further
more it is none of our business about
rewards and punishments?
That most of us would be happier
and get along better if we minded our
own business, unless we can help
someone out of a bad place?
If you know these things it is good
if you don't think about these and
other good things.

Truly, a heart that God hath claimed,
A heart that reached for trodden down
Now God hath given him a crown,
Where he is gone.
He is gone,
To the land of a perfect day, 1
Where all cares are vanished away
There we'll meet to love and adore,
On God's beautiful sunlit shore,
When I'm gone.
