WASHINGTON, April 14.?General

department that he had received no

is continuing to press for information. \

1' Despatch of troops to strengthen the
supporting line or the shifting of border
forces to places best adapted to
eventualities are matters of which
General Fnriston himself is the only
j judge in the war department's view.
Officials here were still unable to
determine today just what troops
were involved In the Parral affray,
i The opinion prevailed, however, that
it was a detachment of the
Thirteenth cavalry, although some
officers believed it migh have been a
detachment of the Tenth. An official
version of the incident is anxiously
nawlted and may have great weight
in determining the course to be pursued.
Telegrams transmitted to Secretary
Lansing yesterday by the Carranza
embassy here are believed to
be reliable hut even these do not
agree on details of what occurred.
; Mexican advices from the border i
i offer still other versions of the af-1
fair. Since General Carranza sharply
criticised the American commander
in transmitting a report of what j
happened officials here feel it Is nec-,
essary to have the American officer's
own report before any conclusion I
can be reashed.
