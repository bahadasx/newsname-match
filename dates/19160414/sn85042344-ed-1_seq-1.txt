WASHINGTON, April 13. The
United States Is disposed to con
sider Germany has admitted one of
her submarine commanders is guilty
of torpedoing the channel steamer
tiussex, which had aboard more than
a score of American citizens. Presi
dent Wilson and Secretary Lansing
today examined the official text of
the latest communication from Ber
lin and are understood to have
reached this conclusion, although no
announcement was mado.
I'nless Germany should without
equivocation admit attacking the ves
M'l, Inflict adequate punishment upon
ttue submarine commander and in
.Jtlier ways show evidences of good
faith, action of a drastic nature un
doubtedly will follow. Details of the
policy to be pursued are expected to
be formulated at the cubinet meeting
tomorrow.
t'ii( uiostaiKvs Similar.
The assumption of Germany's ad
mission of guilt is founded upon the
marked similarity of the circum
stances surrounding the explosion
which damaged the Sussex and the
attack upon a steamer In the channel
described in the German note. The
date,- time and locations are practi
cally tho same. The damage done by
the torpedo from the submarine and
tbo explosion which wrecked the Sus
sex are idem leal. The course, being;
followed by the Sussex and the ves
sel mentioned In the note, are simi
lar. .
Two Vwl'iiis.
Tho only difference In the two ver-
hions that of Germany based on the
i court of a submarine commander and
that of the United Stutes founded
upon reports 'of the British and
French governments, affidavits of
survivors and Investigations by
A.nierican naval, diplomatic and con
sular officers Is found In the de
hirinllon ot the Sussex and the de-
scription of the vessel attacked by the
submarine based on a silhouette

mumler while peering through his
periscope, it is considered that the
slight variations in the two sides of
the case very well couiu oe rccon
dluil
Following the receipt recently ot
JBfess dispatches announcing that the
Jei man government flatly denied re
sponsibility for the explosion which
damaged the Sussex, It was believed
the case the United States was pre
paring against German submarine
warfure would have to be based on
the accumulation of illegal attacks
ruther than largely upon the disaster
to the channel steamer. It now being
revealed upon Just what contentions
.tnd arguments Germuny Dases ner
denials of responsibility, the adminis
tration considers that the case of the
Sussex Is stronger than ever.

More Automobiles Needed I
ALTHOUGH dozens of Tutsans yesterday called The
World office and volunteered the use of their tars
for the deserving children's free auto ride and picnic to bo
held tomorrow, many more autos will be needed to make
tho affair a complete success. Did you ever stop to think
of what it means to these little folks to get a wtiole after
noon's ride in an automobile t Many of them have never
been in a car. The Purity Ice Cream company is going to
furnish the ice cream for the picnic at Owen park, and
Charley Myers of the National Biscuit company will fur
nish the cakes. If you have a car and want to help make
this outing a big success, you are urged to telephone the
editorial department of The World today, so that we may
know just how many automobiles we can depend on. The
Town Critic is having badges printed and they will ba
pinned on the children before the ride starts. Children not
having one of the badges will not be entitled to participate
in the picnic at Owen park. Automobiles are to report at
The World office Saturday afternoon at 1:30 o'clock. The
ride will start at 2 o'clock. The picnio will begin at 4
o'clock. To take part in the picnic a child must first par
ticipate in the Butomobile tour.
Mr. F. A. Haver of the Merchants and Planters bank
has consented to assist in securing the autos, and those de
siring to contribute cars should call either Mr. Haver at
the Merchants and Planters bank or The World office. The
name and phone number of the donor is all that is desired.

The Republican national com

claimed ten of the twenty' delegates
for sure. McGraw men claim the two

all the contests, which McGraw men
do not concede, the vote will lie a tie.
A letter was received today from
James U. Reynolds, secretary of the
national committee, according to Mc
Graw men, which said that members
of the next natlonul committee will
bo selected at the convention and not
by the committee.
This, It Is claimed by McGraw men,
blows up the Harris chances, as It Is
said he has depended on his success
before the national committee. Ac
cording to the Harris headquarters ho

conventions are now over, records will
be made up by both sides to be pre
