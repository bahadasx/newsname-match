An accommodating friend, who for
sook his architectural duties and kept
up a throe month' night and day vigil
on her husband's studio, mndn It pos
sible to-dAy for Mn. May B. Com

Compris, widely known on a mural
artist. After two weeks' secret hear
ings a referee recommended to Su

Mrs. Compris bn grantod a decree,
John C. McOownn of tho firm of
MoKIm, Mead tc White, nreh'teots,
was tho accommodating friend, end
his three months' watch confirmed
Mrs. Comprls's suspicion, she alleged,
that Miss Claudia Boott, an actress,
was more to Compris than a modi'l
for his well known conception of
"Dawn."
It was Just about dswn last Sep
tember, Mcdowan testified, that he
saw Compris and Miss Hcott enter tho
artist's studio at No. 59 West Thirty
ninth Street. Compris had escorted
Miss Scott from tho slago door of
tho theatre in which she was ap
pearlng. McOowun telephoned for
Mrs. Compris and her friend, Miss
Katherlno Haines.
Tho nildlng pnrty waited at the
door of tho studio whllo Mcdowan
knocked and yelled: "Telegram for
Compris." Tho door was opened and
tho trio burst In. Tho meeting be
twean Mrs. Compris and Miss Scott
was described by Mctiownn ns fol
lows: "Mrs. Compris could not restrain
her anger upon seeing Ml.ss Hcott,
who was reclining on a couch In her
nightie, with her hair hanging down
her bnck In two thick braids, while
Mr. Compris was standing by In pink
pajamas.
"Mrs. Compris approached Miss Scott
and shouted most dramatically, 'Now,
Claudia Hcott, at last I havo gut you1
For throe years I havo been trying to
catch you. My reward has come now"
Miss Scott was unafraid. Hh remnlnod
on the couch and casually asked of
Mrs. Compris: 'Well, now that you'vo
got whnt you want, what aro you go
ing to do about it?'
"I thought the two women would
come to blows but Mrs. Compris was
very calm Indeed. She pointed to Mlsi
Scott und said! 'There, my friends, ate
my husband and his model, .Miss Siott.
Take a good look at them.'
"Mr. Compris fear"' tho mectiuj
might tako u serious turn. He walked
over to his wife, took her by the arm
and remarking that 'aha ought to b.i
satisfied,' pushed her out of- tho room
und wo followed her."
Miss Haines testllled thn woman In
the nightie was Miss Hcott
