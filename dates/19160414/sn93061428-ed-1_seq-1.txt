I on tha Sea Air Line railroad about
1 twenty-three miles v south-went of
Cheraw which is near the north line
of the state well to the east side.
Mr. BeiL of the Joyce-Pruit Com
nanv. was interviewed and it was
learned from him that John R. laavea
two brothers, W. T. Joyce, or Murires
boro. Tenn.. Chas. K. Joyce, of Ros
well and a aister, Mrs. Black well, of
Chapel Hill, Tenn. The mother ol
the family to whom John R. was a
pecialiy devoted, writing or wiring
tier each day, died about eighteen
months ago at Chapel Hill, Tenn., the
old family home.
The following from Tuesday's
Roswell News, gives a very good ac
count, ao far aa can be learned at
present: .
Details of the accident are very
meagre, and little information was
conveyed to Chas. F. Joyce, a brother
of the deceased, who resides in this
city, other than the mere statement
of fact concerning the death and man
nar in which it was inflicted. It is
known, however, that Mr. Joyce was
making an overland trip in a new auto
which he had just purchased the orig
ating point being Atlanta, Go., and his
announced destination being Ftnehursl
North Carolina. It ia not known
whether he had a 'companion or a
driver, but it ia presumed that he
was alone at the time the fatal acci
dent occurred, and that his car must
Save skidded from a bridge or soma
embankment and turned turtle.
Tha message received by the broth
err in this city stated that the body of
the dead capitalist was under the care
of a ministur of the little town of
Patrick, and would be held there
awaiting disposition by relatives. Mr.
Chas. Joyca will leave tonight fur the
scene of the accident and convey the
body to Chapel Hill, Tenn., the old
home, where interment will follow.

Í It iLs thought that J. F. Joyce.nephew
J of tha dead man, who Is now at Bal-
timore. will also hasten to join the
Í funeral cortege.
The deceased waa a financier well
known in the Pecos Valley, as he came
here some twenty-five years ago and
established a mercantile business at
V Carlsbad. He waa 60 years of age
at the time of his death and was un
married. He waa president of the
First National Bank of Carlsbad, pres
ident of tha Joyce-Pruit ntoresta in
the valley, president of the Morrow-
I nomas Hardware Company, at Am
arillo, Texas, and prominent in other
financial concerns of this section. It
was only last week that ha purchased
the Godair property at the corner of
Third and Main streets, in this city,
at a valuation of 130,000. While he
was a man of large affairs Vfiich re
quired much of his time, yet he had
become an extensive traveler, of late
years, both at home and abroad. He
was on tha Carpathia, - the vessel
which rescued so many of the survl
fit Tlf.nl. .I!...)..

him during his ireara of residence in
the Pecos Valley, and leaves a mem-
aory or a lire, which, while crowded

kindness for the varied dealings with
his fellow men. Roswell and the
Pecos Valley mouma tha loss of the
man who cama here in its pioneer
days ana carved fortune which
rates h'.m easily a millionaire.
The following from a sneclal edi-
;,2 ytlnn of the Current published June 2.1,
if 1911, gives a very fair sketch of Mr.
VI Joyca up to flAvfle ft years ago:
A In every community there la some
jjl individual who take the lead in on or
J all of tha various enterprises. Carlsbad
IF has a pace-maker in the nancial world
JV and ona who haa virtually run off and
left "the field" the others being unable
to follow. Ha Is on of the men of the
town who are pointed out when
strangers ara being shown tha people
ad places of interest as tha moat suc
cessful man In town and ona of the
men who haa mada Carlsbad. This
distinguished personage ia nona other
than John R. Joyce. To every man,
woman, and child, In and around Car
lsbad, he ia known simply aa "John
R."
Away back in tha latter part of th
tghties befoas th advent of the rail
road from Pecos, Texas, to Carls
bad, a tall, erect, thin young man
came to what waa then Eddy, New
Mexico, now Carlsbad, and after
spending some little time in tha town,
which could than only boast of a
half dosea houses, let it become known
that ha would form a partnership with
George Pennybaker In tha mercantil
business. Carlsbad waa an expert-
ment. John R. had been engaged In
tha mercantile and furniture business
In Fort Worth, Texas, for ten years,
and cama west looking for health and
a place to invest his capital, which
wa ample at th time for this coun
try. Pennybaker, Joyce aV Co. built
a frame structure at the comer of
('non and Green streets, 25x100 f let
and storked it with general merchan
dise. They bought only such goods
aa were staple necessities, not catering
to the extravagant tastes of the foun
ders of the town who were from New
York and the east. Their judgment
proved faultless for their trade in
creased from the start and business
grew from the time the doors were
opened until, one might say, today.
After three years business Messrs.
Pennybaker, Joyce A Co. sold their
business to A. Pruit A Co., Penny
baker going to Los Angeles and Mr.
Joyce taking a year to rest, travel
and recuperate. A. Pruit had come
from Colorado, Texaa, and had for a
year been interested with J. A. Walker
and R. H. Pierce in the Tansill block
under the firm name of Piare é. Wal
ker. Soon after a merger was ef
fected with A. Pruit Co. wth Pierce
A Walker and th two became A,
Pruit Co. Then after a rest of a
year, John R. Joyce opened in Roswell,
th spring of 1893 and after a year or
more under tha firm nam of Joyce
Pruit A Co., that firm absorbed the
firm of A. Pruit at Co. and also ab
sorbed the Jaffa-Prager Co., of Carls
had. Since 1894 the firm of Joyce
Pruit A Co. has gradually spread un
til it today stands for an investment
of nearly one million dollars.
Tha main house ia now established
at Roswell, and branch houses at Car
lsbad, Pecos, Hagerman, i'ortalea and
Hope. Their stores carry a complete
line of merchandise of practically ev
ery line of business, from the latest
up-to-date millinery to hardware, wood
coal and feed. Their grocery and dry
goods departmenta are under the su
pervision of competent, capable men
who are alwaya alert to the intercuts
of their employes as well as to the
demans of their customers and the
stores are models of modern business
institutions. They also set the pace
for the other stores of tha respective
towns. Their wholesale trade reaches
in aa many different directions as
there are points to the compasa and
long strings of freighters' wagons
mark the various roads leading to the
ranches and smaller towns which dot
the plains and hills of southeastern
New Mexico.
Mr. Joyce ia an organiser. He has
succeeded where others failed. His
close application to business during
the years he waa fathering hia insti
tutions supplemented with square, hon
est dealing and business principles
with his fellow man has won for him
a name coveted by all but possessed
by few.
Of all the houses owned and oper
ated by tha firm of Joyce-Pruit 4 Co.,
the name of John R. Joyce stands aa
president. He is also president of
the First National bank, in this city,
which is, by the way,one of the strong
est nnancial institutions or the kind
in the southwest having a capital
stock, surplus and undivided nrofits
of 1136,000.
Mr. Joyce has during the past few
years gradually relinuuished his irrin
on the details of the business in favor
or his nephew, the vice-president of
tne company. J. r rank Jovce. and has
ought to en toy some of hia hard
earned accumulates. He enloved
traveling and after making a tour of
nia native and has made ten trini
abroad. Some few years ago he
visited the old country spending sev-
vi i iiiuiiwiB iiKni seeing in me prin
cipal countries of Eurooe. This, how
ever, simply created an appetite for
further adventures and about two
years ago he mada a tour of the
world spending about one vear and
three months on the trip. Ha ia a
careful, close observer of human nit-
ture as well as of economics and re
turned to his home in Carlsbad with
a seeming unlimited sudiiIv of lnfor.
mation relative to the various coun
tries he visited and is thoroughly con
versant with their ways, customs and
nusiness principles.

COLUMBUS VICTIMS MAY
HAVE TO ENTER COI'RT TO
SECURE COMPENSATION.
Merchants and other properly own
ers of Columbus, N. M., who lost their
belongings in the Villsla raid last
month, may have to go into tho
courts to establish a valid claim to I
taiiicu. us Mui-auun i
as to whether the loss was caused by I
an invasion, riot or insurrection, or
by robliers, will be the contended
made to evade responsibility for the
payment of the claims.
The Columbus property owners con
tend the fire resulted from the work of
the rioters and that they are con
vinced any jury would make the same
decision. One of the main losers in
the Columbus raid was I'. K. Lemon,
Jr., proprietor of the leading grocery
and merchandise store in the border
town. His store, which was the first
to be set on fire, was insured for
914,000 including the contents, lie
is in El Paso in an effort to hace the
claim adjusted without recourse to
law.
"A number of the Mexicans who
were killed by the troops after cross
ing the lino had clothing on taken
from my store," Mr. Lemon suid. "One

When the bandits rode through the
Casas (.rundes valley, they had on
bright neckties and new suits of store
clothing. I am informed. A number
or piles or discarded clothing were :
found along the line of retreat. If
it had not been for the looting of ;

Th armies of the German crown'
prince around Verdun are still vigor
ously on tha offensive against tha
French.
Having delivered an attack along
the line from I Mort Homme to Cu
mie res which netted them a few small,
portions of the French trenches on
the east of I-e Mort Homme, the Ger
man commander rested their infan-.
try here; but in the region of Douau- '
mont-Vaux, northeast of Verdun,
threw their men in large numbers
against the French trenches.
Here they met with success, but
only for a short period of time, for
the French in a counter-attack drove
the invaders from advanced sections
of trenches they hsd rsptured and in
the operations took about 100 German v
prisoners.
While the Douaumnnt-Vaux attack .
was in progress, the Germans had not
overlooked the line between Ie Mort
Homme and Cumiares, and covered
the entire region with intense artil
lery fire, probably preparing for an
other attack by infantry. '
Along the remainder of th front In
France and Belgium there Were only
artillery bombardments. In one of
these north of tho Aisne the French
guns caused serious losses tn a strong
German column on the march.
In the Russian theater an attempt
by the Germans to take the offensive
in the region of the lkskull bridgehead
was stopped by the Russians. Tho
