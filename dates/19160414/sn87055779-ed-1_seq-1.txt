SAY COMPANY CANNOT
AFFORD TO REDUCE RATE
Head of Combine Declares
Cost of Producing Gas is
Too High to Permit
Lesser Charge.
International News ervTi.e:
UFAYKTTi:, Ind.. April U.
Gas rates ar? to be decreased
here about 10 per cent, subject
to the approval of the public
service commission. The pres
ent rate Is $1 per 1.0w cubic
feet. The Northern Indiana Gas
and Electric Co. operates here.
Following a conference between
Mayor Fred W. Keller and Mayor
Ralph Gaylor of Mishawaka with
representatives of the Northern In
diana (ias and Electric Co.. at the
city hall this morning Mayor Keller
announced that the fight for
lower
gas rates will b; continued
before
the Indiana public utilities
commls-
sion.
After explaining that for economic
reasons It was impossible to lower
rates in South Bend at this time,
the gas concern's representatives left
the matter in the hands of Mayor
Keller and Mayor Gaylor. The lat
ter two men declared after the con
ference that the petition for lower
rates would be taken up before the
utilities commission next week.
Clarence II. Geist of Philadelphia,
president of the Northern Indiana
Gas and Electric Co., and head of
40 other like companies In Indiana
and Ohio, G. W. Curran, secretary
of the concern, and C. N. Chubb,
manager of the South Bend plant
represented the gas company at the
conference. Mayor Keller, Mayor
Gaylor and City Atty. Eli F. Seebirt
represented the city. The confer
ence was held in the office of the
mayor at the city hall ai.-i continued
from 10 o'clock until 12:45 when
the session adjourned with no com
promise having been reached.
Gc'st Gives Company Side.
Following the conference Mr. Geist
gave out a statement, presenting the
gas company's side of the question,
and explaining the reasons why a re
duction could not be made at the
present time.
"All of the products used by this
company have increased greatly
during the past year," he declared.
"The South Hend plant is operated
by an oil system and the price of
this product has doubled since a
year ago. It will cost between $50,
UÖ0 and $00,000 more to operate
here in 1916 than it did in 1915. The
cost of oil will exceed that of a
year ago by between $35,000 and
$40,00, while the price of gas fit
tings and other materials have in
creased to the extent that they will
cost between $10,000 and $1'0,000
more this year than last.
Can't Got Oil from Mexico.
"We have been expecting ship
ments of oil from Mexico, but you
will readily see that we cannot se
cure this oil under present condi
tions. Therefore we havo plans un
derway for the erection of a coal
gas plant in South Bend which will
enable us to operate cheaper than
with the oil system. The plans for
this plant are well advanced and w
expect to lower the rates here in the
future, whether the matter is taken
before the utility commission or not.
'Cost of production is 10 cents
more on the thousand feet this year
than last. Now the city wants us to
reduce another 10 cents. This means
0 cents less on the thousand feet.
Why should the gas company be
compelled to reduce its prices while
f..ie prices of every other product
are rapidly ascending? It can easily
Ke seen that this is not sensible.
"Mr. Chubb explained to the rep
resentatives of South Bend and
Mishawaka that even the laborers
employed y th gas company are
osking for increased pay. Prices
are eoing up in every direction and
it does not seem reasonable that gas
rates should be reduced under the
present conditions.
"If we had a coal gas plant in
South Bend the n.te would be re
duced on July 1," continued Mr.
Geist.
"We expect to make a reduc-
tlon whenever we can get this net
plant in. The rate will probably be
reduced then 10 cents per l'OO feet.

GENERAL
ATTACK UPON
U.S. TROOPERS
Military Element Again in
Saddle of Mexican Govern
ment and Repetition of
Parral Fight is Likely.
BORDER IS PREPARING
AGAINST AN ASSAULT
Only Few Automobiles Ven

of "Sniping."
International News Se-vlce:
EL PASO, Texas. April 14. Fear
of a general Mexican rising and at
tack upon American troops such as
dyfd crimson the plaia at Parral,
brought a new tension today to the
already menacing situation that con
fronts the American expedition and
the International relations of the
United States and Mexico.
The military element in Mexico Is
aRain in the saddle. Official advices
from Mexico City state that First
Chief Carranaa has arrived there
from Quertaro on his way to Vera
Cruz, whence he will proceed to
Yixvitan. He has issued a decree
calling upon the Mexican people to
show calmness in the new crisis that
ha arisen, but in Carranza's ab
sence Gen. Alvaro Obregon, his min
ister of war, and Gen. Candido Airu
ilar, foreign minister, will conduct
the government.
To the importunities of these two
leaders, both ambitious, is attributed
the de facto government's demand
for the withdrawal of American
troops from Mexico. Observers on
the border assert that with Carranza
away and Obregon and Aguilar di
recting' Mexican affairs the situation
will not torook of long diplomatic
negotiations.
Bcports Conflicting.
Reports as to the battle at Parral,
which began when "snipers" opened
fire upon American soldiers who
were obeying the request of Mayor
Joso Ie La Lut Herrera, to leave
the town, were tili conflicting today.
Most of them wer to tho effect that
one American soldier had been kill
ed and 20 wounded and many Mex
icans killed. One rumor had it that
fully 150 Mexicans had been killed,
but this is believed to b an exagger
ation. Closely following the news of the
Parral battle came rumors that an
American force had clashed with a
body of Mexican troops near the
town of Troya on the railway be
tween Jimlnez and Parral. This ru
mor said that the Mexicans were
mostly Carranzistas and that the
Troya clash preceded the fight at
Parral. the Mexicans hurrying on to
that town and Inciting the iopulace
to attack the Americans.
Several Carranzista soldiers are
reported to have been killed either
at Troya or Parral. but this report
lacks confirmation. The Americans
used a machine gun in the Parral
conflict and this was undoubtedly
w-hat caused heavy execution among
the Mexicans that attacked the
Americans.
OuanI Against Attack.
Throughout the length of the
state of Chihuahua the American
troops are taklrtg extreme precau
tion against attack. Their vleilam-e
is reflected along the border. Only
few automobiles venture out of El
Paso and other border points with
out arms. Reports reached police
headquarters today that Mexican
snipers had fired across the Rio
Grande at motorists following thp
trail along the river bank, but n
one was injured.
"Can war be avert 'd ?" is the chief
question asked on O iwirdr today.
It has replaced the v.eks-old qury
of "how long irill it take to capture j
Villa?" The fact that the Amer
ican troop responded without hesi
tation to the fire directed upon them
at Parral shows that a "shoot-first-
and-thn-ask-o,uestions'' attitude has
been adopted by the expeditionary
force. This spirit maj at any mo
ment set diplomatic quibbling at
naught and bring war with a ru?h,
according to border observers.
Mexican official reports referred to
the Parral battle as a "lamentable
incident." but throuih Mexico there
went today reports that "the grtn
goeV were responsible for the clash
because they had disregarded Car
ranza's warning against entering
town in Mexico.
Ord-erd Civilian Disarmed.
' N7 erplir.atlon has yet come
from Mexican sources of the fact
that th civilians of Parral were
armed. More than two months ajro
