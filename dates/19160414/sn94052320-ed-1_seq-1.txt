They favor the flat repeal adopted by
the house. A sharp controversy in
conference between the two houses is
predicted. Anticipating that the house
would Insist upon it resolution, Sen
ators Lodge, Simmons and Stone were
named as the senate conferees.

Most of the tariff discussion did not
touch on the sugar issue, which had

voted to an .amendment by Senator
Works of California, to increase the
tariff on lemons and other citrus fruit
to 1 cent a pound. This was defeated
by a vote of 44 to 29, Senator Phelan,
of California, being the only Demo
crat to support it.
Senator Phelan declared seven coun
ties in California comprised the whole
lemon producing region in the United
States and that the reduction of the
duty on lemons had caused a loss of
8800,000 in revenue. .
Senator Vardeman opposed the

Villa Leaves His CoiMsnd; '
Deatb Report Believed Ruse
Mexico City Francisco Villa has
left the main body of his command and
is hiding, almost unattended, in the
Sierra mountains of Chihuahua, ac
cording to information given out by
the War dpoartment Wednesday. - -
The latest of his retreating forces
passed through the town of Cusihuiria-
chic, Chihuahua, in their flight toward
the mountains. They were' closely
pursued by forces of the de fscto gov
ernment, who hope to capture the
bands and locate their leader.
Rumors from several, sources that
Villa had died of blood poisoning and
press dispatches from Queretaro tell
ing of an announcement by the de
facto government's war department
that it had reason to believe the bandit
chief had been killed in action were
the occasion of much discussion here..
In some quarters there was a disposi
tion to credit the reports, but they
were without official confirmation and
both army officials and State depart
ment officials suggested that they had
probably been put out by Villa's
friends as a ruse. , '

Business Boon Readies Retailers.
Chicago As spring approaches and
the period for more active outdoor
operations it at hand, the business sit
uation is being featured by an inten
sitv of activity exceeding even that
of the boom months iuat past.
The effects of full employment and
risinor waees are seen in the excellent
reports on the retail trade which come
from all sections of the country. There
is a large distribution of merchandise
and retailers, instead of buying for
immediate wants only, are endeavor
ing to stock up for some time to come.
This always ia the ease when the turn

' On for Their Fatherland.
Berlin, via London Following the
speech of historical importance made
in the relchitag Friday by Chancellor
von Bethmann-Hollweg, Dr. Peter
Spahn, leader of the Center party, and
Friederich Ebert, leader of the Social
ists, endeavored to expand upon the .
chancellor' declaration concerning
Begium and the relation between
Germany and the United State.
Dr. Spahn said America had shown
that her sympathies favored England.
Dr. Ebert said neutral rights must be
respected conscientiously and that un-.
restritoT use of the torpedo must be
opposed "with the utmoet sharpnes.".
Taking up the American question, .
Dr. Spahn said: 1
"The press, people and the govern
ment of America bave ahown by their
conduct that their sympathies and bus-' -inesa
interests favor England and not
Germany: America ha become a reg
ular arsenal and base of supplies on a
large scale for our enemies.
"The American government has -
bound itself where we are concerned
to the formal letter of the law and ha
employed regularly a more generous -
interpretation of the regulation of
neutrality, only in favor. of tha state
hostile to us. Much has been permit
ted there which, if done by us, would .
have been used in America to provoke
an outbreak of hatred against us." ,
Dr. Spahn referred to th prolonged -
negotiations with he United State in
regard to the submarine question, ssy-?,
ing in that connection 1. 1 ....... , . ,7
"American of German descent have
indeed endeavored to create a senti- .
ment far our view, unfortunately with
out success. It is incomprehensible in
view of the sound business instinct of
Americans, that the interest con
cerned in legitimate export trade con
tinually bow to British encroachment
on maritime rights. The hopes placed
in the American congress in this re
gard have been disappointed."
Herrbert said be welcomed tne
enunciation by the chancellor of a
more definite peace program, but de
clared he had no expectation of any
response from the governments at
London, Fans and Fetrograd, although
it was evident the inclination for
peace waa increasing among . the peo
ples.
Therefore," he continued, "uer-
many must continue the war for de
fense of the fatherland, and the Social
ists, who. aa representatives of the
working classes, would be chief suffer
ers from the project in the throttling
of German trade and industry, must
continue to support the government
resolutely."

Indians Hold Potlatch.
Pendleton, Or. The old-time In-,
dians of the Umatilla reservation held
a potlatch Saturday. This is a custorr ,
almost extinct and amounts to an aJ
ministration of the personal estate of
a dead Indian. When a member of the .
tribe dies without heirs it is customary
for the friends to gather and divide the
personal effects. This is made an oc
casion for feasting and v&riocs cere
monies are conducted, but the- e ere
seldom held in modern days.
