LET US NOT CLUTTER
UP NON PARTISANSHIP!
WHILE there is still time, a new bill
proposing nonpartisanship—and
nothing else should be initiated and
filed. It should be done at once.
The present nonpartisanship bill
—so-called—clutters up and confuses
the issues. It is more than a non
partisanship bill—AND IT SHOULD
NOT BE.
It is a presidential primary bill. It
provides for a modified system of
preferential voting. It brings up new
questions of controlling corrupt prac
tices. It does all these things in addi
tion to providing nonpartisanship.
These things may be fine. The
point is, however, that THEY DO
NOT BEAR EITHER DIRECTLY
OR INDIRECTLY ON THE PRIN
CIPLE OF NONPARTISANSHIP.
They raise other questions, other
arguments, other disputes, other de
bates. They tend to draw attention
away from the question that should
be the only one—namely, nonpartisan
ship.
THE PRINCIPLE OF NON
PARTISANSHIP IS TOO GREAT
TO BE JEOPARDIZED BY ANY OF
THESE OTHER PROPOSITIONS,
IN ANY DEGREE.
MURDER OF AGED SISTERS
ANOTHER IN LONG LIST OF
SEATTLE CRIME MYSTERIES
ADDED to Seattle's long list of notorious crimes, the
double murder last week of Mrs. Corinne Wheeler
and Miss Kate B. Swift, her sister, will probably go
down in police history as an unsolved riddle.
Who beat in the aged women's heads with an ax
and a hammer may never be known.
Similar crimes, with similar unsolved endings, have
been frequent in this city. The murderer escaped and
in a short time his deed was forgotten.
The following story of the Madison Park mvsterv
is the 'irst of a series of storie*- or famous murders com
mitted here which will be printed in The Star.
For some the guilty persons were brought to
justice. In many others the murderers got away.

U.S.WIL NOT WITIDRAW ARMY
FROM MEXICO, CABINET SAYS
By Lowell Mellett
l*r«M Mtaff <'orr*«pond*r)i
WASHINGTON, April 14.—American troops will remain in Mexico for the present
at least. The cabinet at its session today determined not to change its policy. This
means the hunt for Villa will proceed.
After the cabinet session, it was stated that Carranza's request for withdrawal of
American forces had not been answered.
Consul Rodgers in Mexico City has not been instructed to treat with Carranza to
ward an amicable settlement.
The cabinet members failed to indicate when they intended to reply to the request.
No light on President Wilson's stand during the cabinet meeting was obtainable.
The cabinet members unanimously decided to gather all the facts before attempt
ing final action. j —*

facing a critical situation, it was reported today.
Official Mexican accounts of the fight there -aid a
hand of supposed Villista*. defeated by Americans at Troya
VILLA RESOLUTION INTRODUCED IN HOUSE BY McLEMORE
WASHINGTON. April 14.—A resolution providing that th*
American forces shall not withdraw from Mexico until Villa Is
killed, captured or driven Into exile was Introduced In th* house
today by Representative McLemor*.
Secretary Lanaing announced today h* wa» prepared to "treat"
with Amha***d«r Arredondo of Mexico with regard to th* with
#e*wal of American troop* a* requested by Carranra, but aald he dirt
lot know what line th* negotiation* would tak*.
on Monday, retreated toward Parral.
The American cavalry pursued them, but found a strtmg
sentiment against "gringoes" at Parral The clash on Wed
nesday followed, in which one American, at least, was re
ported killed.
Ileadqnarters today waited Brig. Gen Pershing's report
with regard to the fight. It wa« said 150 American soldiers
participated
Latest report* indicate that the fighting continued with
the mob greatly outnumbering the American*
In a second outburst of hate against the "gringoes,"
many Mexicans were reported to have been killed It was
'•aid the cavalry turned a battery of machine guns on the
mob.
Fear Bandit Troop* May Have Cut
Off Detachment From Pershing's Main Body
Some feared that unorganized bandits might have cut
off a detachment separated from the main column and pre
vented the news from reaching Pershing. It was believed
that a force thus surrounded might possibly face serious
casualties fighting its way out.
1 Iradquarter* were incHned to regard the Parral inci
dent as a hysterical outbreak of Mexicans not familiar with
the trend of events in their own country.
It was also reported that forces of Villistas or inde
pendent bandits were between the advanced American guards
and the base of operations at San Antonio, Mexico.
A party of 200 attacked a cattle train three miles from
Parral.
This organization may have been among the Mexicans
that fought Americans in the streets of Parral.
Anxiously Await Reports on Whether
Carranza Soldiers Fought Americans
Other bandits defeated the Carranza garrison at Pilar
de Cochos, driving them back into Parral. The de facto
troop* at Pel Yallc were also beaten by guerrilla horsemen.
If the Carranza garrison at Parral joined the Villistas,
or independents, and fought against the Americans, the situ
ation will become critical.
Whether Carranzista soldiers participated in the attack
on Americans at Parral is the most important question.
The Mexican account posted at Juarez stated that civil
ians attacked American troops who entered the city thru a
mistake.
It failed to mention Mexican casualties, evidently fearing
that such an announcement would cause more ill feeling in
the fuarez garrison, which is already reported to be strongly
anti-American.
Carranza Planning Entry Into Capital
Sunday; Mexico City Is Excited
MEXICO ( ITY, April 14 Publication of news from
I'arral, where Mexicans clashed with American troops, caused
mild excitement today. There were no demonstrations.
Gen. Pablo Gonzales issued a manifesto warning the pub
lic against attacking Americans.
Alvaro Obrcgon, the de facto war minister, informed the
local garrison concerning details of the fight.
lie declared the United States soldiers had violated their
pledge not to enter cities in Mexico.
Newspapers printed long accounts of the American ex
pedition operation, asserting the troops are suffering from
the climate and emphasizing the fact that they have failed
to capture Villa.
Carran/a, accompanied bv < )bregon and members of his
cabinet, has arrived in a suburb from Queretaro, where the
de facto capital was temporarily located.
It is reported they plan an official entry into Mcxico City
on Sunday.
