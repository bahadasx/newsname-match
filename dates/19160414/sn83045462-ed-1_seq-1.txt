Gen. Carranza's note and telegrams
urging the withdrawal from Mexico of
the American troops, and all information
at hand regarding the latest military
developments, were ready to be
laid before the cabinet.
When Secretary Baker left the cabinet
meeting he said there was "absolutely
no change in the Mexican situation"
and that the status of the
American troops was the same.
Gen. Funton today reported to the

Dispatch of troops to strengthen the
supporting lines or the shifting of border
forces to places best adapted to eventualities
are matters of which Gen. Funston
himself is the only judge, in the War Department
view.
Officials here were still unable to determine
today just what troops were involved
in the Parral affray. The opinion
pre\ailed, however, that it was a detachment
of the 13th Cavalry, although
some officers believed it might have been
a detachment of the 10th.
There was no information in the department
other than recent unofficial reports
from various sources to show what
troops were in the vicinity of Parral.

Attitude of Democratic Leaders.
Just what should be done, in the opinion
of administration senators, was
not clear. They said It was evident,
from the official text of Carranza's note
to the State Department, that the first
chief of the de facto government had
not demanded withdrawal of the American
troops from Mexican soil, but had
asked to enter Into negotiations reKarding
such a proposal, and that later
he had urged the Mexican ambassador-designate.
Mr. Arredondo, to use
very argument to persuade the American
government to withdraw the
American forces.
Senator Stone, chairman of the for
*jgn relations committee, conferred today
with Secretary of State Lansing:
relating to Mexican developments and
sought the latest information concerning
the fight at Parral. Following the
conference 'Senator Stone said he had
ieurtoed nothing that had not been made
public already and that the State L>epartmem
had received no official infor^

Intervention at an Alternative.
"The problem confronting this government
is how long it Would be wise
to keep an expedl^ionery force in Mexico,"
said Senator Stone. "I have never
believed that we would achieve the
main purpose of the expedition, the

Secretary Baker arranged to have messages
from Gen. Funston which might
come during the cabinet meeting sent to
him at the White House. An official version
of the incident is anxiously awaited
and may have great weight in determining
the course to be pursued by the administration.
Telegrams transmitted to Secretary
Lansing yesterday by the Carranza
embassy here are believed reliable, but
even these do not agree on details of
what occurred.
Mexican advices from the border offer
still other versions of the affair.
Since Gen. Carranza sharply criticised
the American commander in transmitting
a report of what lhappened, officials
here feel it is necessary to have
the American officer!* own resort before
any"conelusmncan be reached.
No Further Battle Reported.
American Consul Edwards, at El
Paso, telegraphing today his reports,
indicated there had* been no further
fighting with American troops since the
affray at Parral Wednesday night.
Consul Edwards said Americans
reaching El Paso from the interior of
Mexico brought varied rumors of the
fighting at Parral. but no confirmation
of the report that 150 Mexicans were
killed. All his information was that
the Americans retired from Parral
Wednesday and there was no news of
further hostilities.
Arrival in the suburbs of Mexico City
last night of Gen. Carranza with his
retinue from Queretaro was reported
by Special Agent .Rodgers. who said it
was believed Carranza planned to remain
there during the negotiations for
withdrawal of the United States troops
and be in close touch with Gen. Obregon
and other cabinet members.
State Department officials do not believe
Carranza plans to permanently
make Mexico City his capital as yet.

Hurried Movement of Soldiers Shows
That 400-Mile Line of Communications
Is Being Strengthened
for Emergency.
EL PASO, Tex., April 14 ?
There are unconfirmed reports
that the battle in Parral in which
a detachment of 140 American
cavalrymen were attacked by
citizens, was more desperate than
indicated in the Mexican official
advices, and that it lasted for four

more than 100 Mexican civilians
and Carranza soldiers were killed
and wounded and that one American
soldier was killed and several
wounded. The Americans
were said to have used a machine
gun in the battle.
The advance guard which met
the unexpected attack in Parral
probably has passed the Cl.ihuahua-Durango
line, and now is
in a district where Villa has a
strong following.
19,000 Regulars on Border.
More thair 19,000 United States regulars
are guarding the Mexican border
from Brownsville, Tex., to San Diego,
Cal., today while hurried troop movements
southward from Columbus, N. M..
show that the line of communications
reaching over 400 miles into Mexico is
being rapidly strengthened to meet any
emergency.
American scouts are watching the Pulpito
pass, which leads from Sonora into
the Casas Grandes district of Chihuahua
state, for the appearance of Gen.
Arnulfo Gomez, commanding 2,500 Carranza
infantry and cavalry. Gen. Gomez
is awaiting orders from the Mexican
minister of war. Gen. Obregon, to meet in
Chihuahua for the announced purpose of
taking up the pursuit of Villa. In the
event of trouble with the de facto government
Gen. Gomez would be in position
to strike the line of American communi- i
cations at Casas Grandes.
El Paso and Juarez Are Quiet.
In spite of alarming rumors and considerable
apprehension which was expressed
in some quarters. El Paso and
Juarez remain calm.
As far as is apparent on the surface
loday the Mexicans in both cities have
only a languid interest in the situation
brought about through Gen. Carranza's
request for the withdrawal of the
American troops from Mexico and the
clash between American troops and
civilians at Parral. The only noticeable
excitement is among the Americans.
At the same time the anti-American
agitators, who for weeks have been
spreading, stories of the United States
intention to embark upon a war of conquest,
have not overlooked their opportunity.
Their first effort was the starting
of a story in Juarez to the effect
that hundreds of people had been slain
in an attack upon Parral by American
soldiers and that the "gringoes" had
been defeated with great losses.
/
Alarming Story Disproven.
Gen. Gavira, the Carranza commander,
took speedy steps to crush this
story by posting in a prominent place
Gen. Obregon's official account of the
Parral incident. The people accepted
the official version and what little excitement
had been created quickly subsided.
The authorities here were so well
satisfied tnat there was no occasion for
alarm that nothing beyond the normal
precautions were taken to guard the
town during the night. Today rumors
of impending riots and revolutions
have given way to the intense interest
with which the developments in the
diplomatic situation at Washington are
awaited. Even the popular amusement
of locating Villa has lost its charm
pending the result of President Wilson's
deliberation with his cabinet.

Gen. Pershing moved his camp south
yeterday, penetrating far Into Villa
territory, where he found numerous de
facto government detachments under
Gen. Garza, who gave the Americans a
friendly greeeting and co-operation.
Aeroplanes were first to reach this new
front. Gen. Pershing traveled here in
an automobile train of supply trucks,
which made a record-breaking trip.
The fight, which occurred about ?
o'clock last night, was several miles
in the rear of the automobiles carrying
Gen. Pershing and his escort. It lasted
about twenty minutes. When the

No Word From GeiJ? Pershing-.
SAN ANTONIO, April 14.?Gen. Funston
still , was endeavoring to learn from
j Gen. Pershing the American side of the
story of the fight at Parral. Wireless,
field telegraph and every other available
means of communication have been employed
to get to him the instructions to
rush to headquarters with all possible
speed a report on the incident and the
measures he had taken to relieve the little
cavalry force that was in a fight for
its life Wednesday night. It is realized
here that Gen. Pershing must first receive |
from Parral the story of what occurred, j
and, because of his own location, far to ,
the front, perhaps beyond the most ad- j
vanced wireless station, might have to j
use couriers in getting the account of the
developments of the past forty-eight
hours back to the border.
! Secretary Baker's instructions had |
| not reached Gen. Funston early today, |
I but already scouts were investigating j
Carranza troop movements in northern
Mexico in that part of the country 1
through which the line of communications
extends, and steps taken to guard
against attacks. Any extensive movement
of troops along the line, the seizure
of railroads or the dispatch of additional
men into Mexico will depend
upon the exact wording of Secretary
Baker's instructions and upon the character
of Gen. Pershing's expected report.
No important change will be
made until Gen. Pershing has communicated
with headquarters.

House Select Committee Pronounces
U. S. Attorney of
New York Guilty.
ACTION UPON REPORT
MAY WAIT TWO WEEKS
Accused Official Should Be Given

A House select committee today submitted
a report pronouncing: Unitec

guilty of contempt for criticising s
House subcommittee in vest! grating- impeachment
charges against him b>
Representative Buchanan. Chairman
Moon informed the House he would request
no action for at least two weeks
In order to give Mr. Marshall opportunity
to consider it.
The report recommends that a bench
warrant be issued for Mr. Marshall anc
that he be brought before the bar ol
the House for a hearing. It also recommends
that he be permitted to speak
for himself or be represented by counsel
whep brought before the House.
A letter Mr. Marshall wrote to Chairman
Carlin of the subcommittee about
five weeks ago charging that he anc
the two subcommitteemen. Gard of Ohic
and Nelson of Wisconsin, were pressini
investigation of the impeachment articles
merely to protect Representative
Buchans&i, who Mr. Marshall had caus
ed to be indicted in New York, was the
basis for the select committee's action
Letter Held Defamatory.
"Mr. Marshall's letter of March 1, 1916.'
the report said, "is defamatory and tend:
to bring the committee into contempt ane
ridicule. By the printing and publlcatioi
of the same Mr. Marshall violated th
privileges of the House and was guilty o
contempt and is guilty of contempt of th<
House of Representatives until he purge:
himself thereof or is purged by punish
ment."
The entire select committee, compose*
of Representatives Moon of Tennessee
L*enroot of Wisconsin, Crisp of Georgia
Garner of Texas, Sterling of Illinois, signed
the report. Its presentation was for
mal and caused little interest on the floor
Text of Resolution.
The resolution under which the Hous<
will proceed, if the report is adopted, fol
lows:
"That the said H. Snowden Marshal
in writing and publishing said Utf^er wai
guilty p*"a breach of the priviN|ge8 am
a contempt of the House of Reptesenta
tives, and that the said H. Snowden Mar
shall be furnished with a copy of thi;
resolution and a copy of the select com
mittee of the House of Representative:
appointed to investigate tHe charges mad*
against him in the House of Representatives.
"That when H. Snowden Marshal'
shall be brought to the bar of th<
House to answer the charge of having
violated the privileges of the House
of Representative as afore set out, the
Speaker shall cause to be read to said
H. Snowden Marshall the findings ol

committee of the House, charged with
the duty of investigating whether 01

"If the said H. Snowden Marshall de
sires to avail himself of either of thes<
privileges the same shall be grantet
him. If not the House shall thereupoi
proceed to take order in the matter."
The report said that it was the opin

spite the fact that he told the com
mittee at a recent hearing that hi
would retract none of its contents.

I Interest In German Proposal.
1 The German proposal for a mixed

garded here with interest.
t It was admitted at the State Department
that there was precedent for
such a method of procedure before going
to the extreme of severing diplomatic
relations.
The Dogger Bank case during tho
Russo-Japanese war, where a very serious
situation existed betweerw Russia
and England as the result of tne sinkt
ing by Russian warships of a number
e of British fishing smacks, was successfully
adjusted through an international
^ mixed commission. It was intimated
i that there was a bare possibility that
ir the United States, before taking a final
step, might agree to such a proceeding,
but it was made.clear that In any event

j over the loss or endangering of Amirk
ican lives or inconsistent with the refusal
of the United States to arbitrate
as set forth at the outset of the Lusi

I St. Paul Brings Evidence, ?:

; State Department's Use
NEW YORK, April 14.?Guarded by
- Sir Charles Allom of the British foreign
office, the evidence in the Sussex case
which has been gathered for the Amer
lean State Department arrived here today
on the American line steamship
St. Paul. It included affidavits of the
survivors, and was part of an exceptionally
large amount of embassy mail filling
twenty big sacks.
The affidavits are those gathered by
attaches of the American embassies in I
Paris and London. Among the St. Paul's
586 passengers was Edward H. Huxley
of Englewood, N. J., president of the
United States Rubber Export Company
of this city, who was a passenger on the
Sussex, escaping uninjured. Mr. Huxley.
after confirming previously cabled
news dispatches regarding the attack on
the Sussex, stated positively that front
the hour that the vessel left the British
Bhore until the moment she was attacked,
and for nine hours thereafter, not
another vessel was sighted except the destroyer
which came to the rescue.
Mr. Huxley made this assertion in
connection with the text of Germany's
note of April 10 to the State Department
citing an attack by a German
submarine on an unnamed vessel in the
vicinity of the Sussex at the hour when
tne laner mei wilii iiuamip.
Denies Boat Carried Ammunition.
Mr. Huxley also said he was positive
the Sussex carried no ammunition. The
German note declared that a "violent
explosion" on the ship which was torpedoed
warranted "the certain conclusion
that great amounts of munitions
were aboard."
When he and other passengers were
in the junior officers' room on board the
rescuing destroyer Mr. Huxiee said a
warrant officer who had taflsd with
