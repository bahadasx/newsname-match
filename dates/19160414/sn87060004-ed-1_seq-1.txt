TRY IT! SUBSTITUTE
FOR NASTY CALOMEL
Starts your liver without
maktng you siclt and can
not salivate.
Every druggist in town your
druggist and everybody's druggist has
noticed a great falling-off in the sale
of calomel. They all give the aame
reason. Dodson's Liver Tone is tak
ing its place,
' Calomel is danderous and people
know it, while Dodson's Liver Tone
is perfectly safe and gives better re
sults," said a prominent local drug
gist. Dodson's Liver Tone is per
sonally guaranteed by every druggist
who sells it. A large bottle costs 5O
cents, and if it fails to give easy re
lief in every esse ot liver sluggish
ness and constipation, you have only
to ask for ycur money back.
Dodson's Liver Tone is a pleasant-
tasting, purely vegetable remedy,
harmless to both children and adults.
Take a spoonful at night and wake
up feeling finer no biliousness, sick
headache, acid stomach or constipat
ed bowels. It doesn't gripe or cause
inconvenience all the next day like
violent colomel. Take a dose of
calomel today and tomorrow you
will feel weak, sick and nauseated.
Don't lose a day's work! Take Dod-
son's Liver Tone instead and feel fine
full of vigor and ambition.

RIVER TRIP
The interest ill the Bee's Cincinnati-Louisville
BJver Trip is still
growing and the contest is coming
alone nicelv. The contestants have
learned by this .finw that it is not
much trouble to get anyone to give
them a dollar for a years subscrip
tion to the Semi Weekly Bee and the
McCalls Magazine, as the two pa
pers are well worth $1.50 and then
added to this the subscriber is doing
the contestant a personal favor in as
sisting them to win the one weeks
vacation of travel and pleasure. Each
contestant should bear in mind the
fact that six people in this county
will win this trip and those who get
the largest number of subscriptions
are the ones who will win. They
should neglect no opportunity to ask
everyone they see to subscribe for
the paper or to renew if they are al
ready getting it. The Bee has lately
added a four-page comic supplement
that adds greatly to the looks and
cost of the paper and every family
in this territory should be willing to
pay the small sum of $1.00 for a
years subscription to their home pa
per. A dollar a year is about TWO
cents a week, is this not a small
amount to pay for a twice-a.week
visit of your own home paper.

High School Notes
By Our High School Correipondents
Slide! Slip! Scoot! Thru the most
entrancing fairyland of modem ages
down the fire escape, and we are
proud of our useful novelty. More
than fifty people witnessed the de
cent of the 350 school , kids, and
not all were content as witnesses,
many visitors "took a slide" and
seemed to enjoy it almost as much
as the pupils. We were'glad io see
many visitors from our neighboring
town Madisonville on hand, and we
hope that, being encouraged by the
success of this drill, they will im
mediately proceed to install a similar
one in their school.
Everybody has the spring fever;
even Geometry is too hard for the
brilliant Sophomores this kind of
weather.
Outdoor work seems more intic
ing than study, judging from the
zeal with which the boys, and even
girls, have laboured on the tennis
court. But the result is that we now
have a nice, smooth and level play
ground. In a very short time a con
crete curbing will be placed about it
and tennis will be the predominating
game ot the school.
Bang! heir that ball strike the
mitt, he's got the stuff. E. H. S. is
going to outdo itself this season.
By count it was found that about
75 pupils per minute can be sent
down to safety in case of fire. At
this rate there is no possibility of
anyone remaining in the building in
case of danger. No, . up-to-date
school building should be without
some quick and safe means of exit
No school after Tuesday 18th un
til Monday 24th. The teachers will
be in Louisville and the pupils
where? Well, you'll see them, scat
tered 'round the town, loafing on the
streets, playing marbles, and you'll
wonder how so many children could
have gotten into the school building.
The special car for the Earlington
people to K. E. A. is not vet filled
and other patrons are invited. A
good time is assured all who make
this trip.
These Look Good .
Paved streets kept clean and in
repair.
Business houses and residences
kept neatly painted.
Roads graded and no 'duck ponds'
allowed to form
Front yards with concrete walks,
flower beds, and vacant spots seeded
and frequently mown.
Back yards so clean they jcompel
admiration.
School yards. sanitary and with ad
equate playground's for children.
Store windows with neat displays
of goods and a spirit of thrift in ev
idence.
Churches well filled on Sundays,
No street Corner loafers and bums.
A strong spirit of civic pride.
Everybody hustling for himself
and boosting for this town.
Thesei are good signs push them
along.

FIRE ESCAPE
JOLLIFICATION
Children, Alumni, Teachers
Trustees, Citizens, Take
Slide in Try-Out
DEVICE INSPECTED BY
MADISONVILLE AUTHORITIES
Yesterdays demonstration of
tho new fire escape at the "John
a. Atkinson Memorial School"
turned out to be something of a
community jollification, and
everybody took the slide -almost.
In addittion to all theschool chil
dren, the teachers and most of.
the trustees a considerable num
ber of the alumni of the school
and a bunch of big-and-jolly and
thin-and-plucky interested men''
about town shot the chutes in
great glee. It was open to the
public and visiting friends and
the bridle was off school discip
line for a full half hour and nor
restriction was placed on tha
number of rideB one conld take,,
not oven in the case of the most
dignified teacher. It is rumored
that two of the faculty managed
to get by in purely directory ca
pacity. J. J. Qlenn, D. Utlejr
It. S. Dulin and F. P. Stum,
member? of the Madisonville:
School Board, were here to in
spect the machine and witness
the demonstration. It was hard
to restrain them, especially Prof.
Glenn, from taking the dive with
the most supple membergofthe
Earlington Boardlihd" tVeywota"
only deterred by the exhibit of st
torn and painted suit that had
been worn by a member of the
Earlington Board when, earlier
in the day, he had escorted the
teachers through a preliminary
series of try-outs in preparation
for the general exhibition. The
children had the time of their
lives, with an "occasional timid
exception. One chubby young
railroader in the first grade made
the trip many times from the
top story and could be seen and
heard passing the next landing,
sitting up gaily and whistling
cheerily the "toot, toot" of his
own .excursion train. Expres
sions of satisfaction are heard on
all sides at the acquisition of
this adjuuet of "safety first' by
the Earlington Board of Educa
tion. It is understood that the
Madisonville School Boaid con
templates the erection of fire
escapes on the school buildings
of that city.
