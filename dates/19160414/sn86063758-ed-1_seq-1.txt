The Right of Search Defined?Citizen
Has Some Liberty to Preserve.
f
Tv-um nf Hlaoksbur?. appellant, T6.
^ Andrew Bean, defendant - respondent,
Criminal law. Arrest without warrant.
Searching prisoner's person to
obtain evidence against him.
Cherokee. Affirmed.
Opinion by George W. Gage, A. J.
Tfce defendant was tried by the mayor
of Blacksburg for transporting alcoholic
liquors, v^as found guilty, and
was sentenced to pay a fine of $iuu j
or to serve 30 days at hard labor on j
the public works. j
The circuit court in a formal or-:
der reversed the judgment and dis- j
missed the case.
The municipal corporation has ap- i
pealed by seven exceptions, the first |
^>!x of which refer back to the excep-!
which the defendant had made j
to the mayor's judgment and the sev- !
. enth of which is general in character.!
The recoivl is short and we shall j
consider the issues which were ar- i
' *TJ ?. and which fairly arise 011 the j
toccrd, and without much regard to i
formality. J
The defendant is a young white j
f dinner, and lives near King's Creek, |
| a few miles oat from Blacksburg; he
" had been to Uni-on Court House, where
ne bought the whiskey from a dispensary;
he put the liquor in ihis
trunk and checked the trunk to
Blacksburg, where he disembarked
from the railroad cars, bought a ticket
to King's Creek (towards York) and
had his trunk rechecked to that place.
Pet ding his passage from one line
of railroad to another, the chief of;
police at Blacksburg, without any
process, searched the defendant's person,
got therefrom his trunk key
opened the truiik and seized the whiskey,
arrested and incarcerated defendant.
and only the next morning
thereafter procured to be issued a warrant
of arrest.
So that it so happened one town in
the same judicial circuit sold the
whiskey to the defendant for a profit
and another town took it from him by
- V ^17 VotMnf*

it in his possession.
We have no doubt but that a conviction
under the recited circumstances
is unlawful. ,
Some things are to 'be more deplored
than the unlawful transportation of
whiskey; one is the los sof -liberty.
Common as the event may ^e, it is a
reri^us thing to arrest a citizen; and
a mere serious thing to search
Ills person; and he who accomplishes
:t ruuoi da sj in cdaformity to the
3 c-i the- land. There are two reason
> for this, one to avoid bloodshed
and the other to preserve the liberty
of the citizen.
Obedience to law ie the bond of society;
and the officers set to enforce
the law are not exempt from its man
?ate?.
Irn the instant case the possession
of the -liquor was the body of the offense;
that fact was proved by a forcible
and unlawful search of the defendant's
person to secure veritable
key to the offense. It is funamen\
tal that a citizen may not be arrested
and have his person searched by force
and without process in order to secure
n oroinof him Thf? act of
CtTOWiiLkVii ?
L 190S (26 S-tas. 10S9) has no applica?
tion to the case. IThere was no flight
by the defendant a.id therefore no pursuit
by the officer. And that act gives
no power to search the person.
^ It is better that the guilty shall es^
cape rather than another offense shall
be committed in the proof of guilt.
The judgment of the circuit court is
^ affirmed.

the farmer, for example, undertook to

[g i Now, isn't that true? Isn't it? Thinl?%.
IS1 about it. Think ri/ght now. Don't
[0 , wait until tomorrow. What sort of
j ! an existence would he have if each
j. [ farmer undertook to live to himself
5y alone? Wouldn't it be the existence
r- or a cave man : wnen ne lans 10 cooperate
with his neighbors, that is the
1. tendency, toward the existence of the
e cave man. And the farmer could come
I nearer living to himself thaia any othd
er class of citizens. /What would he
d do if There was no town to go to? If
d there was no church? If there was
ie none to come when he get sick? When
lt he fails or refuses to cooperate he is
11 helping the tendency which would
jf bring about those conditions. Think
e> about it. (Now, I am going to make
another break.
And then this advertisement goes on

5e mines his metals, or who provides ftis
_n pepper and salt, his 'books and papers,
Ly or who furnishes the ready means of
. transportation and exchange wlhereby
: his myriad wants are supplied."
; Here is the last paragraph that X
ie am going to quote a d it should be
e_ remembered, not only by the farmer,
ie but by every other member of this
le community, and of every other com1V
n-unity. Listen. Read:
Ld "Neither should he forget that the
is more he assists otners tne more me/
3- can assist him."
to Do you need to be told that? Don't
you know it? Why repeat it? S>amem
times. we forget. Especially is that
i. true of this age as it relates to the
! ^''nss tihat make for the higher civi(y
lization. Lest we forget, then, I relt
peat it. "Interdependence means clvi,,
lization." "Civilized man is distin,e
