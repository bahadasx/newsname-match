? Keep Milk Sweet.
Ptray Werner, Jr., Mlnouri Agrioil
unu aipanmeni ouuoD,
The approaohing rm weath
er will make it ne jann for
dairyman and housevires to take
extra precautions to .event loss
tnru souring of milk,and oream.
Aa milk ia an Idaal f ak fnr hnih
babiea and baoterla, infrequently
nappens that in waim weather
th&baeteria ara the first to enjoy
tyifi deuoate food. Tho tha aoid
developed in the milk during
souring is not harmful to the
health of adults, it is Injurious to
infants, and distasteful to many
older people, and will surely
oause dairymen to loose money
- w
: A successful dairyman near
the Missouri College of Agrioul
ture has solved this problem by
removing the oauBes. Sinoe dirt
is loaded with bacteria he first
keeps both dirt and bacteria out of
1.1 . . ...
aa mux, oj using a smuu- top milK
pail, by keeping his pails, cans,
strainers and other milk utensils
clean, and by keeping his cows
toe from dirt and filth. This
can be cheaply and efficiently
done by thoroiy washing the
utensils with hot water as soon
after using aa possible and let
ting them in a elean proteoted
place to drain until used, by
brushing the oows daily and pre
venting them from becoming
dirty, by using plenty of bedding,
and by keeping the barnyard
olean.
Sinoe baoteria will not sour
milk unless they grow in It, he
prevents their growth by oooling
his milk as soon as nroduoed and
keeping" If cool until delivered.
The beat of dairymen oannot fur
nish milk so free from baoteria
that it will not sour if left for
hours in a warm plaoe. Both
dairymen and housewives will do
well to remember that oleanliness
and low temperatures (60 de
grees F.) will prevent this loss.
On sloping corn land try plant
ing and cultivating across the
slope where possible in order to
reduce soil washing. When oorn
is drilled with the Blope furrows
are made which are sure to in
crease washing. While checked
oorn is usually preferred by the
best farmers on land that is not
subject to washing, it is uaually
more important on rolling land to
cultivate in one direotion only,
and that around the slope, t The
greatest damage is done on steep
slopes because the faster the flow
of water the greater the amount
of soil it will earry away. If you
double the rate of flow of water,
it will more than double the
amount of soil removed, A more
perfect application of the prin
oiple of planting across the slope
is found in contour farminir.
which is more fully explained in
Circular 78 entitled The Control
of soil washing, reoently issued
by the Missouri Agricultural Ex
periment Station at Columbia.

Get Some Bees!
Have you bees?
Why waste a honey crop?
' Why let your neighbor's bees
get your erop?
Buy bees by the pound with a
good Italian queen.
Get a few swarms of your own
this sprinar or summer.
Catoh run away swarms during
May and June and hive them In
good hives. ' f
Transfer swarms and comb from
bee-trees to movable frame hives
on warm days early in May.
Buy neglected stands of bees
and take oara of them and o-iva
them a ohanoe. The bee is a
faithful and deserving ereature.
Furnish a neighbor bee-keeper
with a few good hives, with
frames and comb foundation
starters and pay him for hiving a
few swarms in them for you.
Buy good strong ooloniea of
bees in hives with atraight oombs.
These should be eeoured from
eome one known to be reliable
and experienced in bee-keeping.
Buy a few nuclei from a re
liable bee-supply man. A nu
cleus is a part of a oolony of bees
eeoured by dividing up a strong
oolony into two, three, or four
parts, putting eaoh part in a se
parate hive to build up into a full
oolony.

of bees and for getting a few
swarms for a start by these and
other methods ars Inoluded in a
