Responsible.
ADMINISTRATION NOT SATISFIED
WITH ATTITUDE OF TEUTONS
Washington, April 13.—The United States is disposed to con­
sider that. Germany, in the latest submarine note, virtually admit­
ted one of her submarine commanders is guilty of torpedoing the
channel steamer Sussex. President Wilson and Secretary Lansing
today examined the official note of the communication from Ber­
lin, and are understood to have reached this conclusion, although
no announcement was made.
Wilson's Demands.
•Unless Germany should, wilhoul
equivocation, admit attacking the ves
sell, which had aboard more than a
score of Americon citizens, inllicl. ade­
quate punishment, upon the comman­
der ol' the submarine and in other
ways show evidence of good faith,
action of a drastic nature undoubted­
ly will follow. Details of the policy
1o be pursued are expected to be for­
mulated at the cabinct meeting to­
morrow'.
The assumption of Germany's ad­
mission of guilt is marked on the
similarity of the circumsyuices which
surrounded the attack on the Sus­
sex. The date, time and location are
practically the same.
Considers Case Strong.
The damage done by the torpedo
llred by the submarine and the ex­
plosion which wrecked the Sussex
are identical. The course being fol­
lowed by the Sussex and the vessel
mentioned in the note are similar. It
now being revealed upon just what
contention and argument Germany
bases hfer denial of responsibility,1 the
administration considers the case of
the Sus6e^fis stronger than ever. A
statement*':df facts -will be ready,
probably, to be brought to the atten­
tion of the German government with­
in the next few days.
State Department.
.Much ot' the evidence in posses­
sion of the state department regard­
ing recent cases has to .40 with the
attacks on the four ships, other than
the Sussex, mentioned in the German
note. Those were the 'Manchester
Enginer, Englishman, Eagle Point,
and Berwindvale. The explanations
by Germany of these cases are con­
sidered unsatisfactory, the German
contention not agreeing with the evi­
dence which has been gathered by
tho slate department.
German Proposal.
The German proposal for a mixed
commission to determine the facts in
case of differences in opinion of Ger­
many and the United States is re­
garded here with interest. The ad­
ministration does not. consider, how­
ever, that there is any real contro­
versy over the facts.
It was reiterated tonight President
Wilson had every intention, should
the situation reach the point where
diplomatic relations with Germany
no longer could continue, of notifying
«ongresn of his decision, giving a
recitation of events leading up to it.

OFFICIAL TESTIFIES
Washington, April 13.—C. A.
Schmidt of Wausau, Wis., represent­
ing the American Society of Equity,
a co-operative organization of far­
mers, today testified before the sen­
ate committee investigating the sisal
shortage that the present factories
from which he bought were unable
to guarantee a supply of twine suffi­
cient' for several months in advance,
and that they were unable to buy sisal
at present.
Leo. C. Brown, assistant secretary
of the New Orleans bankers, who are
financing the Yucatan sisal planters,
explained a report that the bankers
had authorized a gratuity of $ 00,000
to Governor Albarado of Yucatan for
their sisal contract. The report
reached the committee thorugh Sen­
ator Curtis in affidavits of Kansas
sisal buyers that. Brown had told
them he had been prepared to make
the offer in his negotiations with Al­
barado, but that the governor had re­
fused.

NEW YORK TRIBUNE
ENDORSES ROOSEVELT

New York, April 13.—The editorial
announcement' today by the New York
Tribune that it will support Theodore
Roosevelt for the presidential nomi­
nation on the republican ticket is tak­
en to mean the shelving of any shad­
ow of an Elihu Root movement, for
the Tribune has been aggressively
pro-Root. It is the understanding
here that Mr. Root opposes Justice
Hughes for president, and that his
ambition would be satisfied with the
secretaryship of state under Roose­
velt, with an opportunity to partici­
pate in the settlement of the Euro­
pean war.

Real Enthusiasm Shown on All

Project.
EVERY NEIGHBORHOOD
TO BE PETITIONED
Cost of Improvement Will Be
Spread Over a Number
of Years.
Paving is tho topic of the hour in
iCismarck. 'Paving materials, paving
costs, paving benefits, the possible
extension of the paving district to
include property not originally cov­
ered—these are the subjects which
are being discussed in capital
city business houses, on the street,
and at home. Upon one point, all are
agreed—paving is a good thing Bis­
marck needs more paving and Bis­
marck will have it.. llow large a dis­
trict. can be paved this year how
soon paving can be commenced what
preliminary work is necessary, when
and how it will be done, are ques
tions upon which there is not. such
general unanimity.
In the Game to Stay.
The streets committee of the Com­
mercial club announces that it has
gone into the game with the inten­
tion of staying. The committee has
methodically set about its gigantic
task of lining up all the property
holders in the paving district. A
clerk is devoting his entire,time this
week to transcribing rtifcbrd of- ti­
tles to frontage afffSK'g. and when
the comrrtittee and its numerous sub­
committees set out next week on
their canvass of the city, they will
know whom they are to approach.
It is necessary that 5i1 per cent of
the resident property-holders be rep­
resented on the petition, if action is
to be made obligatory upon the part
of the commission. The city com­
mission is already committed to a
paving plan, so no difficulty is antici­
pated from that source. Probably 30
per cent of the frontage in the orig­
inal paving district is already repre­
sented, and there has been pledged
HO per cent, or more, of the frontage
in a number of sub-districts which
property-owners desire added to the
main district.
Oddly enough, the only criticism to
which the Commercial club commit­
tee has been subjected is that it has
not made its district sufficiently in­
clusive. The telephone has been oc­
cupied during the past three days
with calls from large property-hold­
ers who have complained that blocks
in which they are interested have
been omitted. It is believed that
there will be considerably less diffi
culty in enlarging the district to
meet, these demands than would be
the case were it found necessary to
reduce the size of the district.
Cost Really Insignificant.
The cost of paving long has been
a bugaboo to the uninitiated. As a
matter of fact, it will cost very lit.le
more, if as much, to pave in front of
the average residence property, the
Commercial club contends, than it
would to give a dwelling two new
coats of paint. No residence street
will be paved to a width of more than
feet. Some of Bismarck's most,
exclusive avenues have already been
laid out. with but 24 feet of roadway,
lo provide for wide parking strips.
In these areas, presuming that bitu
lithic paving were used, the cost per
front foot, would he but $2.!».", or for
the average 50-fool lot., $147.."0. This
amount, if spread over 20 years,
would require annual payments of
less than $12 for the average city
lot. In the case of a. 30-foot, paving
strip, the cost would be approximate­
ly $15 pe rannum.
lOven with the very largest, proper­
ty-holders, the expense is surprising­
ly smaller than it would appear at
first glance. One of the first signers
of the paving petition had estimated
that his 1,200 feet of frontage, much
of which is in the business district,
would cost him in the neighborhood
of $15,(KM). As a matter of fact, fig­
ured at an average of $5 per front
foot, his paving will cost him $6,000,
or, if distributed over 20 years, an­
nual installments of about $350.
What Paving Will Save.
"Paving will save ahout 80 per cent
of the present cost of upkeep it will
do away -with the necessity of build­
ing crosswalks in the paved area,
which this year alone woulu save the
taxpayers $1,500 it will do away with

WASHINGTON EAGERLY AWAITS
NEWS FROM GEN. FUNST0K
Washington, April 13.—American troops in Mexico have
their first battle with the natives at the moment General Oarnui-*
za is urging their withdrawal. On Wednesday night, while Gen.
Carranza's' note was on its way to Washington, troopers of the
Seventh cavalry, under Major Thoinpkins, were fired on at Parv
ral by Mexican soldiers.
Complete information regarding the losses to the Americail
troops, or to the Mexicans had not reached Washington tonight.
Mr. Baker announced later that he
•V.
v:-
had ordered Gen. Funston to take any
steps that might be necessary to pre*
vent further trouble.
The secretary expressed the hope,
however, that the trouble at Parral,
was purely local and did not presage
further difficulty. I
Carranza's Position.
Gen. Carranza's directing hie cm»
bassy here to point out that the clash
proved his contention that the pres­
ence of American troops in Mexico is
leading to a situation which threatens
to go beyond his control, telegraphed?
that many deaths had occurred on
both sides. Foreign Minister Aguil
lar, in a dispatch sent before that ot
Gwk Carranza, -said ops sgldief waH
killed.
The state and war department re­
ceiving word from the Mexican em­
bassy that the clash had been a ser­
ious one, at once sent orders for a
full report.
Upon President Wilson rests the
decision of what the effects upon the
administration's policy shall be
whether it shall have a bearing on
consideration of Carranza's proposal
for the withdrawal of troops, and fin­
ally, whether Carranza's proposal
shall be accepted, rejected or nego­
tiated.
Withdrawal Doubtful.
Members of his official family indi­
cated tonight that it was practically
certain that no immediate order for
withdrawal of the expedition seeking
Villa would be issued. The subject
will be laid before the cabinet tomor­
row.
Congress will not have an oppor­
tunity to show its feeling until it
meets at noon tomorrow.
Carranza's proposal for the with­
drawal of the expedition, however,
seemed to meet the general sentiment
that the administration should be left
free to handle the situation for the
present.
In Grave Danger.
Tonight the situation of the isolated
detachment is the cause of some anx­
iety. Outnumbered in a neighbor­
hood notoriously anti-American, and
how far from reinforcements no one
here knows, the troopers may be in
grave danger, with only the thin and
uncertain lines of communication
from the advance bases of the Ameri­
can armies in Mexico, can tell.
Consul Garcia's dispatch to the em­
bassy follows:
"General Gavira, (the Carranza
commandant at Juarez) informs me
that last night (Wiednesday) about
140 American soldiers tried to enter
Parral. The people protested and it
appears the garrison did also. Sev­
eral persons wero killed on both
sides.'
Secretary Baker declined to state
whether Gen. Pershing had orders to
keep his troops out of Mexican towns
in the future.
Could Not Pass Parral.
Gen. Funston made it clear, in his
dispatches, that Parral is so situated
that it is difficult to pass around it
and almost necessary to pass through
it to pass south. That probably was
responsible for the cavalrymen enter­
ing the town and the officials noted
all the American reports- agreed that
they retired at once when {be local
officials protested against their pres­
ence.
The war department's investigation
will clear up how they came to enter.
Just a "Feeler."
The first impression of Gen. Car­
ranza's note in many quarters was
that it merely opened the way to a
discussion of the advisability Of with­
drawing the troops, basing the sug­
gestion on a statement of facts as
they appeared to Carransa officials.
It does not specifically request or do*
mand the withdrawal of the forces.
The Parral affair, however* imtre
duces a more serious aspect In his

language that can be construed as
