[By (Lowell Mellett, United Press

WASHINGTON. April 14.—®*orget
ting for the day the nation's threat
ening break with Germany, Wash
ington today sought the answer to
two Questions:
What axe the facts of the fight at
Parral
What will President Wilson do?
Hope for the answer to the first
question lay in expected dispatches
from General Pershing to supplement
the report of the street battle which
came from Carranza's diplomatic
agents, hard on the heels of the first
chief's urgent request that the Villa
chase be brought to a close.
Answer to the second question, it
was thought, might be given at to
day's cabinet meeting.
This cabinet meeting promised to
be historic. There is reason to be
lieve that President W'.lson will meet
his advisors today with his mind
made up that withdrawal of the Unit
ed Stales forces from Mexico Is es
sential to the humanitarian purpose
Tor which they were sent into the
country.
There is reason also to believe
that this view Is not shared by sev
eral of his cabinet officers. The
most likely outcome seen, was a de
termination of the basis on which
the withdrawal should be brought
about.
Ground for expectation of this
action was laid by the president last
night, when forced by the events
'yesterday, he turned an address to
democratic leaders into this chal
lenge:
Have you the courage to come out?
That sentence sent several hundred
banqueters away puzzled and they
are looking to today's developments
to clear the president's meaning. If
it meant the president proposed to
withdraw the United States troops,
there was marked indication last
night that he will meet opposition in
his own party. His speech itself at
this point drew smaller enthusiasm
than it had drawn at many points
probably less significant. Cabinet
officials say and house leaders pres
ent later refused to interpret the chal
lenge—or urged the belief that it was
without significance in the Mexican
situation.
But it was the phrase that every
man present apparently had ringing
In his ears.
That the president recognizes a
fight within hi® own ranks may de
velop, was believed shown by two
other sentences:
•*Frankly, gentlemen, I aan not In
terested in personal ambitions. May!
I not admit even in this conrpanyi
that I am not enthusiastic over mere
party success
Forecast of the sacrifice he mayi
anticipate by such a course was read|
in an earlier declaration in his
speech.
"When I see the crust even soj
much as slightly broken over thei

ways been directed by a board ofj
trustees, I make up my mind that Ij
will thrust not only my arm but my
heart in the aperture and that only
by crushing every ounce of power
that I have, shall any man ever close
up that opening again."

All Members of His Cabinet or

There was especial anxiety to clear
up the actual losses to American sol
diers, said to be one killed and several
wounded, and to learn the specific
manner in which the clash was
brought on. Carranza officials have
been quick to point out that the very
fact of the troops entering Parral was
a violation of the agreement that
Mexican towns should be avoided by
the men pursuing Villa.
While the Parral tight temporarily
overshadowed the main object of the
expedition—to get Villa—army men
Indicated fear that Villa has made his

co-operation of the Carranzistas, can

No Change of Policy.
[By I.owell Mellett, United Press
Staff Correspondent.]
WASHINGTON, April 14.—Presi
dent Wilson's cabinet, after considera
tion of the facts available on the Mexi
can situation, found itself unready to
day to change the avowed policy—
"Get Villa."
Lack of definite information on
events that led First Chief Carranza
yesterday to wire a renewal of his
suggestion that the United States
troops withdraw from Mexico, pre
vented the cabinet from deciding the
ftrtnre course of the United States
army. But for the present ft was
made clear there will be no change.
General Pershing's report on the
•fight at Parral is yet to be received.
Consul Hodgers at Mexico City is be
lieved to be conferring with General
Carranza and his report is desired.
Iispopition was evident on the part
of some memDers of the cabinet to
accept Carranza's original suggestion
that negotiations on the subject of
withdrawal be begun, but there was
strong sentiment against this on the
part of the others. The decision to
gather all facts before attempting fin
al action was unanimous.
No light on the stand taken by the
president himself at the conference,
was
obtainable, but Senator Stone,
chairman of the senate foreign rela
tions committee, returned to the capl
tol after a session with Secretary
Lansing and gave out an interview
that plainly expressed his belief that

The president is known to believe
that intervention would undo his
work of three years in seeking to
allow Mexicans to save themselves.
He Is believed to feel now that fail
ure to find a way to withdraw hon
orably from Carra.nza'8 country
would mean intervention. Those
cognizant of those opinions of the
executive are convinced he will turn
the forces of the administration to the
task of finding the way to withdraw.
ESxact details of the Parral fight
which now threatens to upset the
president's hopes, may come in an
official report from General Persh
ing, through General Funston today.
The latter has received instructions
to reveal all facts as quickly as pos
sible. Secretary Baker at the time
he announoed instructions to Fnn
ston, expressed the hope that first
reports were exaggerated and the
fight may prove to be only a local
affair.
