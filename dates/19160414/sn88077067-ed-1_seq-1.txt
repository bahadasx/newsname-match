the matter to the excited train crew
and neighbors who arrived on the
scene. A hurried rescue party was
formed and worked underneath the
wreckage to remove the bodies. Two
were dead and the third breathed his
last as he was being dragged out
Undertaker Henry Schmitt, of St,
Henry, was summoned and the muti
lated bodies were removed to the
Schmitt morgue at St. Henry, whei
they are still being held under order
of Coroner Ayers for possible identi
fication. Coroner Ayers hud pictures
of the corpse taken by Photographer
Boehmer, of this city, and is making
every endeavor to identify the men.
There were no identification marks
on any of the fellows, and only a few
articles and papers were found in
their clothing.
All three fellows were about live
foot, ten inches in height and possl
bly 35 years of age.
One weighed about 150 pounds
had light brown hair; two gold teeth
above and one belwo; card in poc
ket of clothing bearnig name of D. 15
Wood 3417 Brotherton road, Oakley,
111. This fellow believed to be Jim
Brady, brother of Harry Brady, a
bagggaeman on the B. & O., and of
Neal Brady, former third baseman of
Chicago Cubs.
Another weighed about 160 pounds
had sandy hair, and probably of for
eign parentage. Note on person ad
' dressed to Alfred Polock and signed
by Frank Carcora; contained also ad
dress of B. G. Uher & Oo , 121 North
Wabash ave., Chicago, 111. A Big
Pour railroad defective believed that
he recognized in this fellow a well
known railroad crook of Richmond
Ind., with many aliases, but general
ly known as "Indiana."
The other fellow was a good look
ias, well built man, weighing about
80 pounds; light brown curly hair
Nothing rn his person other than a
pair of new "Blue Grass wire .plyers,
manufactured at Louisville, Ky. One
of the Grangers of near Coldwater,
noting the description of this felliw,
went to St. Henry yesterday to view
the remains and thought he recog
nized a fellow by the name fo Chas.
Lance, of Fremont.
Detective Hull, of the Cincinnati
Northern, went to St. Henry yester
day afternoon and will endeavor to
run down these clews.
Two heavy wreck crans, one from
the Chicago & Erie on the nroth .
one from the Big Four on the boutti,
were rushed to the scene. Although
they were both worked night and day
the track was not opened up until
Wednesday noon, when the grade was
cleared enough that a temporary
track could be built past the wreck.
Several hundred feet of grade will
have to be rebuilt, which will require
several weeks work. Trains were
routed from Greenville to Versailles

igreed not to join the proposed Trol
ley League, therefore this season Ce
lina will have independent base ball,
and the fans will be sure of a good
first-class team.
The players are not asking for any
special donations, but intend to con
duet the affairs of the team themsel
ves, and will book games with the
very best Independent and semi-pro
teams only.
Celnia team has been given full
charge of the Mercelina Base Ball
Park, and all games at home will be
played there. The former base ball
corporation that had charge of the
team last year have donated the uni
forms and other base ball parapher
nalia to the boys, and all the players
are certainly thankful for this dona
tion, as it will save considertble ex
pense. The opening game of the season
will be Sunday, May 7, at St. Marys,
and the management of the Celina
base ball team will put forth every
effort to win tho opening game, for
if there is any team Celina desires to
win from it is St. Marys. The rivals
of Celina this year will be St. Marys,
Wapakoneta and Coldwater. Each
of these towns will have a strong
team. The old Wapakoneta Reds
will be in the field again this year un
der the management of John Meyr,
while Coldwater will be managed by
Cyril Manlar, Coldwater's famous
basket ball player, who helped win
the majority of the games for Celina
the past season. Frenchy Maniar
says that what he will do to the Ce
lina boys when they play at Coldwa
ter, May 21st will be a plenty. He
has gathered together one of the
fastest semi-pro teams in this part of
Ohio, and says that he would rather
beat Celnia at Coldwater than win
from the Boston Red Socka, World's
Champions. There will be some
game at Coldwater, Sunday May 21st,
Remember these dates: May 28th,
St. Marys at Celina. June 4th, Wa
pakoneta at Celina; June 11th, Cold-
water at Celina.
The Celina Base Ball Club asks
the Celina fans to give them loyal
support this year, and they will en
deavor to give Celina the best base
ball that is within their power. The
players are to report for practice at
the Mercelina Park, Sunday, April
ICth.

Endorsement of House Bill 1U4 05
to come up in the house of represen
tatives next Wednesday providing for
tho uniform grading of grain, pre

of grain and regulation of the traffic
therein was made today by the North
western Ohio Grain Dealers associa
tion In session at. the Lima House.
J. T. Custenborder, of Sidney brought
the bill up before the convention and
was one of the leaders in the move
ment for its endorsement.
A petition was received from grain
dealers ill Mercer, Sh"lby, Logan, 'Au
glaize, Champaign and Miami coun
ties requesting that every dealer in
the district do away with the prac
tice of loaning grain sacks to the
farmers for hauling grain. The deal
ers north of Lima have already
adopted the policy and it is thought
likely that those in the southern part
of the territory will also full in line.
Nearly 75 grain dealers were pre
sent for the conference which began
this morning and wound up this al
ternoon with genera,! discussion of
numerous topics upon a program pie-
arranged by Secretary T. P. Kiddle,
ol the association.
Plans were made for the dealers In
each county to hold a banquet in the
near future at which each dealer
should Invite five of his leading pa
trons. Other matters to come up
was a discussion of market quota
tions and the introduction of a reso
lution that the state should class a
grain elevator as a public utility and
making the business of conducting
an elevator subject to the rules of the
Public Utilities commission.

on the part of the Board of Commis

Til E FOOL TAX PAYER
Frank S. Regan, ex-member of Ill
inois legislature, has given his lec
ture, "The Fool Tax Payer", at sev
eral places in this county. He talks
with chalk as well as tongue. The
pictures drawn before the audience
win applause. His subject is taxes.
The Moral ami lesson is temperance.
He has studied taxation as applied in
many states. He hands out many
surprising facts.
One way to get more taxes is to
raise more dogs. Every child born
in Cincinnati comes into the world
with a debt of $165 hanging over its
head. "Why.not go to Kansas, a dry
state, where there is no public debt
and be born" was one of his ques
tions. He named some big tax dod
gers in this country. He stated that
many breweries were openly or se
cretly owned by men living in Eng
land. They made $20 profit on each
barrel and sent the money to England
to help the allies whip Germany. He
said that in St. Louis, this fact spoil
ed the taste of beer to many Ger
mans. Census reports show 58 per
cent, of our people poor.
Our. way of taxing makes more
sure that poor folks pay more tax
than the rich. Booze cost more than
standing army eacli year yet the big
gest standing army was at the sa
loon bar. At Ot tawa the couuty com
missioners heard Mr. Regan, to get
pointers on taxation which is one of
the board's big problems. Regan is
in Ohio under the auspices of the W.
C. T. U. No charge. Hat is passed.
