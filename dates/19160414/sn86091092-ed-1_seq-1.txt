THOMPSON REPORTS TO BOARD
OF DIRECTORS OF DISTRICT
ACTION TAKEN WHILE HE
WAS AT WASHINGTON
WATER MAY BE DIVERT
ED FROM SOUTH SIDE
Surveys Will be Made and Data Gath
ered Which t Will Enable Govern
ment to Asce'rtaih Available Water
—Suggestions of Short Water Sup
ply Plan May be Submitted to Land
Owners—Reclamation Officials Are
Interested in Black Canyon.
Judge J. M. Thompson, attorney for
the Black Canyon Irrigation district,
has submitted a report to the Board
of Directors of the district, on the re
sults achieved during his recent visit
to Washington.
While in Washington a resolution
was passed by the Reclamation Com
mission which in effect admits the
north side as a portion of the Boise
government reclamation project; and
provides, if carried out, for the con
version of water from the south side
to the north side.
The resolutions together with Mr.
Thompson's oral report to the Board
of Directors, follow:
"I beg to submit the following re
port of my recent trip to Washington
insofar as said trip pertains to the
Black Cnayon. I would be pleased to
state orally to you any matter of de
tail you may desire, but in this report
will merely state results.
"After several conferences with the
individual members of the Reclama
tion Commission, which is composed
of Director A. P. Davis, Judge Will
R. King, Chief Counsel, and W. A.
Ryan, comptroller, said Commission
passed the following resolution on
March 6, 1916:
" 'Resolved, That the surplus wa
ters of the Arrowrock and Deer Flat
reservoirs, over and above the require
ments of the constructed portion of
the project and the old canals for
which satisfactory contracts shall have
been executed on or before March 5,
1917, be used to reclaim such lands in
the proposed Black Canyon or South
Side Extensions of the project or both
as are shown upon completion of sur
veys and investigations to be most de
sirable and economical for irrigation,
considering the cost of construction
and operation and maintenance, such
lands so selected as most desirable for
the application of such surplus water
so far as may be required for the pro
per irrigation thereof, to be considered
a part of the Boise project, if and
when the irrigation of such jands has
been recommended by the Director of
the U. S. Reclamation Service and ap
the U. S. Reclamation Service and ap
proved by the Secretary <yf the Inter
lor, and upon execution of satisfactory
contracts securing the construction
and operation payments.
"You will readily observe what this
means to the settlers on the Boise pro
ject. The construction of a portion
of the Black Canyon Irrigation Dis
trict will greatly reduce the cost of
the whole project. As we understand
it, there is now available water
Deer Flat and Arrowrock reservoirs
for about 45,000 acres outside of the
constructed portion of the project
This is what is estimated at present
The Reclamation Service is now run
ning a fly line which, as we under
stand it, will cover nearly all the lands
within the Black Canyon Irrigation
District. There is no question but
what if tl* run-off of Boise river could
be stored by the construction of Joy
reservoir, or one of the other reser
voirs, that there wuld be available wa
ter in Boise river to supply all the
lands within the Black Canyon Im-,
gation district.
"Again, if the decree on the ques
tion of the duty of water would make
a high duty after the middle of July,
we believe the present water supply
would irrigate in time almost all .tlie
lands within the Black Canyon Irriga
tion district in addition to the lanils
now under cultivation in Boise valley.
"I observed that a statement was
published with reference to the settlers
on the north side being willing to
forego any right they might have if
the Government would undertake the
the Government
reclamation of a tract °f 25,000 acres
on the north side of the river. I took
this publication to the Chief ^
of the Reclamation Service but he was
not in, and I %sked that a statement
be left for me with reference to wheth
er any such idea had been propped,
as this was the first time 1 ever heard
it when I read it in the Trjbune.
When I returned I was handed the fol
lowing statement: ,
" 'There is no foundation for the
report that "Engineer Weymouth as
serted that the settlers on the north
side of the Boise river we re willing
forego any right they might have "
the Government wQufd undertake the
reclamation of a tract of 25.000 acres
on the north s' dc , of . the riv er.
* 'I .never heard this statement from
-Mr. Weymouth, nor from anyone else
nor has any proposition
î^lheteople The* matter is. simply
under investigation and no decision o
anv kind has been readied.
"Another point with reference to the
irrigation of these lands and the futur
storage of Boise river which was not
talked? of in Washington but has
bean suggested by ' •'°™^e filing to
ho, was if the settlers were willing
jorego the chances of a shortage oi
water one year in five it might be
possible to take in a great many more
acres of land in the Black Canyon. It
might be well to put this proposition
to the settlers for they are the -only
ones able to decide. It will not be
left to the Commercial club, or any
member of the Commercial club, but
will be left to the settlers who actually
reside on the land and have to bear
the burden of reclaiming it.
"As to the working out of the prop
osition has not been even submitted,
but the Board will readily realize that
several ditches leading out of Boise
river will result in picking up return
water from Boise river, and also reduce
the cost of construction. The higher
up on the hillside a ditch is construct
ed, the more expensive is the construc
tion. So if a small ditch could be con
structed high up on the slope, and
then fair-sized ditches constructed in
the valley where it is more economical
to construct, the cost of the system
would be reduced.
"Just by way of suggestion, and de
viating somewhat from what I started
out to say, the Board of Engineers
who pass on the water supply of Boise
river will have all these matters to
pass upon, and, of course, as far as the
Reclamation Service is concerned,
their decision would probably be final.
But suppose that some people within
the Black Canyon would rather have
their lands covered and take the
chances of n short water supply one
year n five under the present system,
would it not be well to put that prop
osition up to the settlers? This could
not include the 12,000 acres covered
by the Deer Flat reservoir. As we
understand it, they could provide wa
ter for more than 12,000 acres, but
they would have no lands to put it
on. On account of the conditions they
cannot rçach more than 12,000 acres
from the Deer Flat reservoir. Now,
if that part of the system that is to be
irrigated from Arrowrock reservoir
would be willing to take its chances
on a short supply one year in five or
seven, provided it would include near
ly all the district, it might be well to
submit the proposition to the settlers.
But, of course, this has not .been sub
mitted to the Board yet, and it is pre
mature as surveys are simply being
made and no final report on the rec
lamation of any land has yet been
recommended.
"The above is made merely as a
suggestion, and if the Board should
suggestion,
desire, after talking it over with the
settlers, that a nroposition of this kind
should be submitted to them by the
Reclamation Service, it might be well
to make the suggestion to the Recla
mation Service that they submit this
proposition to the people.
"With reference to the water supply
of Boise river which in some measure
affects the amount of surplus waters
that will be available for reclaiming
lands in the Black Canyon Irrigation
district from Arrowrock and Deer Flat
reservoirs, beg to state that according
to A. B. Tallman, irrigation engineer
who distributed the waters of Boise
river in the year 1915, there was a
great amount of return flow to Boise
river by reason of the construction of
drains in the old project, such as the
Pioneer Irrigation district and the
Nampa -Meridian Irrigation district;
and Tallman states that formerly
flow of 1553 second feet was consider
ed as a necessary quantity of water
to fill 60% of the decreed rights of
Boise river, while during the period
from July 19, to October 31, 1915,1142
second feet of the natural flow tilled
the same requirements. It has also
been stated by the same engineer that
the return flow equals 67% of the
amount flowing in the Boise river at
the Highland dam. which would mean
that they could distribute 167% of the
waters flowing in the Boise river at
Highland dam with the ditches leading
from Boise river, and as other drain
agc ditches are being constructed and
the ditches are planned to utilize the
water developed by said drainage, un
doubtedly the amount of the return
flow will increase as years go by whan
more land is put into cultivation above
and below the New York canal.
"This is merely with reference to
the Boise unit, but of course the dis
trict is working to have the Réclama
tion Service reclaim the entire pro
ject, and you will'readily realize my
surprise when I read the statement in
the 'Tribune,' and whv I was anxious
to have that denied by someone at
the head of the Service.
"You will observe that in the esti
mates which are submitted herewith
for this year there is $10,000 for de
tailed surveys of the Boise slope. On
nage 77 you will observe that there
s $50,000 asked to be appropriated as
a fund for making surveys and inves
tigations of secondary projects, there
done tnis year n .
fartherest."
could be no objection to us trying to
get a portion of that $50,000 to survey
the remaining portion of the Black
Canyon, but, as you know, Sena
tor Borah is going to attempt to hook
amendment to the Appropriation
Bill for funds to survey the entire
Black Canyon, and it would probably
be better not to attempt to get any
of the $50,000 at present.
"I am herewith submitting a letter
which I received from Senator Borah
while I was in Washington. (The let
ter states that the. Sanator will give
his best and untiring efforts to the
end that the whole Black Canyon pro
ject be watered by the Government.)
"Director A. P. Davis, Judge King
and Mr. Ryan are all great fnends of
the Black Canyon and, indeed, of the
entire West. I feel sure that the en
gineer will not stoo short of watering
the Black Canyon.
"It is very important that the entire
Black Canyon project be surveyed nad
investigated. The importance of this
is realized, and has been for some
time, and it appears to us that it is
very important that these surveys ana
investigations be made during the year
1916, and I have no doubt if it is not
done this year it will be done in
WATER USERS REFUSE
10 ORGANIZE INTO
A
COUNSEL STOUTEMYER AP
PEARS BEFORE DIRECTORS
AND SUBMITS ARGUMENTS
IN FAVOR OF DISTRICT
PLAN OF HANDLING
PROBLEM
Reclamation Service Given to Under
stand that the Policy is to 'Sit tight'
for Present—Big Legal Battle Over
High Cost of Water on Project is
Pending—Directors Are Not Afraid
that Something is Going to Drop
on Them.
At the meeting of the board of di
rectors of the Boise Water Users' as
sociation held in Caldwell Tuesday,
the proposition to convert the associa
tion into an irrigation district was re
jected. This action of the board re
versed the action that was taken at
the January meeting when the direct
ors passed resolutions favoring the or
ganization of an irrigation district un
der the laws of the state. The action
was taken after a thorough discussion
of the district idea presented by Mr.
B. E. Stoutemyer, counsel for the Rec
lamatibn Service.
The directors stated frankly that
they would take no steps which might
jeapordize the interests of the land
owners under the project; and that
their present policy was to sit tight
and await developments. As one di
rector stated, "I can't see that any
thing it liable to drop if we don't take
action at this time." Acting upon that
theory nothing was done.
District Proposed.
The Reclamation Service, through
Mr. Stoutemyer, urged the organiza
tion of an irrigation district. Mr.
Stoutemyer gave the arguments which
were presented in the letter of Man
ager D. W. Cole and which appeared
in the last issue of The Tribune. He
offered nothing new.
Mr. Stoutemyer in response to doz
ens of questions and in explanation of
the position of the Reclamation Ser
vice insisted that the change to a dis
trict would in no wise change the
status of relations existing between
the landowners and the government
Only when the district arrived at the
point of entering into a contract with
the government would any new rela
tion come up for consideration.
In the meantime, stated Mr. Stoute
myer, the settlers would be operating
their organization under state instead
of government regulations, and would
lighten the pro rata of expense
through the inclusion of at least 30,000
acres of land which now bear none of
the association's current expenses.
Hard Fight Impending.
Hard Fight Impending.
Directors of the association bluntly
made known their intentions, long
hinted at, of making a big fight at the
proper time, in the hope of obtaining
their water rights at a figure around
$25 an acre. From $22.68 to $28 an
acre is the cost they claim was assur
ed them when most of the settlers
came upon the project lands. They
will maintain, in the legal battle which
seems imminent for the future, that
the cost which is now soaring around
$65 an acre, has reached that figure
largely through errors of the govern
ment servants themselves. That the
government should pay for its own
mistakes and not saddle the burden
on the innocent and deluded settlers
will be their contention.
Vote Against Change.
Despite the fact that Counsel Stout
emyer assured the directors and the
stockholders present that their light
can be made even more effectively as
a district, the board members refused
to see the matter in this light and
turned down the motion to proceed
to circulate petitions and otherwise
prepare to adopt the change recom
mended by reclamation service heads.
The statement that settlers on the
upper part of the project are agitating
the proposal to form a separate dis
trict of their own had no effect in in
fluencing the association directors.
Petitions asking that the project
take over the Katherine and Watkins
reservoirs from the Idaho-Iowa Lat
eral and Reservoir company were
turned down.
Power Lease Possible.
The proposition coming from the
Gem Irrigation district by which that
organization wishes to obtain a lease
on the water power rights at Arrow
rock dam received consideration. It
was voted that the Gem people be in
structed to make a definite proposal
to the Water Users' association, this
to be forwarded to Washington for
government action if agreeable to the
association. Thus far efforts of the
Gem district in this connection have
been principally designed to get the
government to set terms under which
it would make such a lease. It seems
that the reclamation service prefers
to have the Gem officials make a bid
for consideration. Further negotia
tions over this important matter may
be expected soon—probably in time
for consideration at the May meeting
of the water users' board.
D. W. Cole, the new project mana
ger. was present at the Tuesday meet
ing, the first he has attended. Ile
spoke briefly of conditions on the pro
ject and interjected a few remarks dur
ing the discussion of the soaring cost
of water rights.

and
Ac
Notwithstanding the steamroljer
methods employed by the Pence-Nu
gent-Elder contingent of the county
central committee of the Democratic
party in this city Saturday, the Can
you delegation to the Pocatello con
vention will not support Mr. Elder for
national committeeman. Of the 30
hand-picked delegates a majority arc
unalterabl - opposed to Mr. Elder. It
seems that Pence, Nugent and Elder
operating through County Chairman
Buckner were unable to find 30 men
in the county who would support Mr.
Elder.
The majority of the committee were
denied the privilege of participating in
the meeting. This majority met and
called a primary election to be held
throughout the county on April 25 for
the purpose of electing delegates to
the Pocatello convention. The dele
gates who were appointed by Mr.
Buckner and who are opposed to Mr.
Elder will probably be elected at the
primary election.
Alexander Appointees Control.
State and Federal appointees or rel
atives controlled the meeting of the
county central committee
Mr. Buck
ne r, trustee of the home for the feeble
minded and an appointee of Governor
Alexander presided at the meeting.
Guy Graham, state fruit inspector, act
ed as secretary of the meeting. C. W.
Whiffin, applicant for the office of
United States Surveyor General and
Harry Whiffin, his brother, represent
ed two precincts. C. H. Bowman,
postmaster at Payette, Cash Nichols,
who was precinct committeeman for
Stuart precinct which is now a part of
Gem county, and the father of the
sheriff of Gem county; Joe Bird, a
county road overseer, and A. W. Mc

trolled the committee.
delegates not
pate in the meeting but who have call
ed a primary election, are: L. L. Dic

Cox of Nampa, proxy W. P. O'Conner.
Proxies Not Admissible.
The meeting was called to order by
Chairman Buckner of the county cen- j
tral committee. Secretary Mumford
was not present, and Guy Graham was
elected temporary secretary. It was
ordered that the roll of the precincts
be called when the matter of proxies
came up. The Pence-Nugent-Elder
contingent as represented by Buckner,
Graham, et al, voted against the use
of proxies. This gave this « ing the
co.ntrol of the meeting.
Messrs. P. E. Smith, W. P. O'Con
ner and others protested against the
action. Mr. O'Conner stated that Mr.
Bitckner had told him the day before
that proxies could be used and that
was the reason "I am here. Buckner,
vou lied to me in. my office yesterday."
The protest was without avail.
The committee proceeded to the
transaction of the business -of the
meeting which was the appointment of
delegates to the Pocatello convention.
Insurgents Call Primary.
The precinct committeemen who
were opposed to the machine withdrew
from the meeting. They organized
by electing L. Harding chairman and
George F. Lee secretary. A commit
tee on resolutions was appointed eon
sistine of W. P. O'Conner of Nampa;
M. A. Bates of Parma and 11. A. <1rif
liths of Caldwell. By vote it was de
cided to hold a primary election in the
county. Tuesday, April 25, for the pur-1
pose of electing 30 delegates to the
state convention.
The resolutions committee submit
ted its report which was adopted. The
~ "
resolutions denounced Chairman Buck
ner for the action taken as follows:
"Further, we denounce the arbitrary
action of T. E. Buckner of the Demo
cratic central committee of this county,
in refusing to recognize the majority
of the legally and duly elected com
mitteemen of this county, represented
in person and by proxy at the county
central committee meeting called by
him for this date, and especially do we
denounce the action of said chairman
and a portion of said committee for
their autocratic attempt to deny to the
Democratic voters of the county their
I».
right to select delegates to til
tello convention by arbitrarily assum- j
ing to name them."
Both factions endorsed the adininis
trations of President Wilson and Gov-1
ernor Alexander and also pointed with j
pride to, the economical county adinin
istration. Mr. H. A. Griffiths wanted j
to go into details on county affairs but i
was reminded that there were other]
and more important matters to attend i
to.
Alexander Loses Friends.
Governor Alexander, undoubtedly,
lost a great many friends by the action
of his appointees. The Democrats
were not slow to denounce the action
of these appointees and they hold that
the Governor was responsible to more
or less extent.
The anti-Elder forces claim that the
Canyon delegation is not an Elder dcl
egation. Ihe Elder people could not
Und 30 men in the couaty who will
stand for the north Idaho politician.
It is pointed out that the delegation i
not instructed and it is known that

CALDWELL IRRIGATION
DISTRICT TO ISSUE BONDS
$20,000.00 Will be Spent on Improve
ments and Development.
A bond issue of $20,00.00 was au
thorized by the landowners of the
Caldwell Irrigation district at an elec
tion held Tuesday. The district has
taken over the property of the Canyon
Hill Irrigation Co., will. contruct a
feeder canal from Mason creek to
join the Caldwell High Line canal;
w,ill construct a new ditch around the
east side of Canyon Hill to a point
due east of the city water tank. At
this last point two pumping units will
be installed. One pump will lift the
water 43 feet, the other 30 feet to
cover lower lands.
Nearly 1000 acres of splendid land
will be reclaimed by irrigation. Messrs.
Shepherd & McConnell have worked
out a plan which has been adopted.
Work will be started on the project
at once.

|
DUTY OF WATER IN BOISE
VALLEY IS DISCUSSED j
Senator Borah has introduced an
amendment to the sundry civil bill
appropriating $10,000 to make an in
vestigation and survey of the Black
Canyon Irrigation project, with a view
to its construction by the government.
Economical Use of Water to Interest
of Every Water User.
The duty of water in the Boise val
ley is becoming a subject of great in
terest. The following article which is
a continuation of an article which ap
peared last week in The Tribune, lias
been submitted: ,
The man absolutely ' void of chin
whiskers comes again on the water
proposition and urges that the high
duty of water that was talked of in
last week's Tribune should be when
there is a scarcity of water in Boise
river; that it is important that a cut
be made when the river begins to fall
j in July, and that prior to that time,
and while there is an abundance of
water in the river, it might he possible
to allow nearly an inch to the »acre
for the lands; that a good soaking up
of the lands in June and the early part
of July, would saturate the soil much
deeper, and prevent the amount stored
away in early spring from being used
up and would be saved for a tune when
the water supply is shorter. Of course,
) the amount to be used should some
what depend upon theamount in the
river and also on the kind of crops
' and the condition of the soil.
I he state and counties are
I he state and counties are interest-J
ed in having the waters economically
used, and in having the amount of ir
rigated area as large as possible. An
economical use of the water, or the
amount that is absolutely necessary
for the irrigation of a piece oi land,
is acquired by appropriation and an
appropriation is only completed by a
use of the water. A piece of land can
acquire no more water by appropria
t j on than is absolutely necessary for
an economical irrigation thereof. As
to what is necessary for an economical j
irrigation of a piece of land is shift- 1
i nK . it is stated on good authority
that after land has been reclaimed 1
and crops have been raised for a few !
seasons, that it requires less water to
grow crops than it formerly did.
As to theamount of water necessary
to economically irrigate land, it should
be considered very carefully in view
of the fact that the state and county
and all are interested in extending the
irrigable area in the state, that sur
plus waters in the storage reservoirs
of Boise river should be used upon
the land most fetile, and where it can
be used most economically
t a kin g
into consideration the cost of the con
struction of works, the operation and
maintanance thereof, is agreed by all.
If after lands have grown crops for
a few years they can be irrigated with
less water than formerly ,as the irri
gated area of Boise valley increases
the waters of Boise valley can be ex
tended over more land, which, taken
together with the return flow, will
