two children by a former marriage,

their final respects over the remains I
of the beloved lady, who, in the early i
days of Pullman's history, was a
potent factor in shaping the social
and religious destinies of the town. !
Mary Ann Watson was born at
Louisville, Kyi', May 21, 1839. On I
October 29, 1857, she was united In
marriage to Pleasant Whitlow, who. !
in 1862, was killed at Livingston, ;
Term.. while supporting his colors In j
the Civil war. In 1868, with her
two children, Mark and May. she re
moved to Kansas, and on August 14,
1874, was united Jn marriage to
Leonard Crawford, who survives her.
Mr. and Mrs. Crawford and the
two children came across the plans !
by team and were in Cheyenne at
the time of the noted Custer massa
cre. The westward journey was con
tinued until the family arrived in
Whitman county, where a quarter
section of government land was '
taken up just east of the present I
town of Pullman, a pari of the land I
now comprising the city ball park.
Later this quarter section was sold
and a farm three miles northeast of J
Pullman was purchased*, where the ;
family resided until 10 years ago,!
when Mr. and Mrs. Crawford re
moved to Pullman.
Mrs. Crawford was the last of a
family of 10 children, her parents 1
having been pioneers of Kentucky, ■
and her entire early life was spent
on the frontier. She lived a useful !
Christian life, and hundreds of
Wends mourn her death.

Suggest East Main Street Viaduct
/ :

1
I A plan for improving East Main
street has been suggested, which
I would cost little more than the pro-
Posed hard surfacing of the stretch
| of road bel ween the concrete bridge
land the city limits, but would result
in far greater benefits to the city.
The idea is to build a wooden viaduct
! from the ridge from which the rock
| was taken by the Warren Construe
! tion company, to College Park addi
tion. The viaduct would be about
1000 feet long and extend over the
railroad tracks, thereby eliminating
four grade crossings. With a little'
change the Bushy road could strike
the viaduct at the College Park end.
Most of the expense of the pro
posed hard surfacing of the road will
fall upon the railroad companies and
I there is little doubt that they would
prefer to put Ihe same amount of
money into the viaduct, which would
eliminate four dangerous grade
LVTERSCHOLASTIC MEET

Forty high schools of the Inland
Empire have been invited to send

jof lev the different clubs and fra
ternity houses.
Tickets for the meet will be placed
on sale next week and in all prob
ability the name.- of ticket purchas
ers will be published, as was done
lost year. Expenses for the enter
tainment of the visitors will be paid
by the money received from the sale
of tickets.
While the students will have
charge of the meet they will not
I guarantee the expenses of the visit
ing teams, the invitations containing
j only the provision that a proportion
I of their expenses will be paid accord
I ing to the gate receipts. The tickets
I will be hold for $1.00, which will

Mrs. Ina Wright-Herbst, soprano;
Prof. Gottfried Herbst, violinist, and
i Prof. Herbert Kimbrough, pianist,
I all connected with the music depart

Mrs. Wright-Herbst has a colora-

crossings. Members of the city conn
ell who have look Into the viaduct
plan believe that it is feasible and;
would be a great benefit as it would
give a short route' to the college and
to College Park addition, which is
within the city limits, and is build
ing up unite rapidly.
The same plan was suggested
man) years ago and the money
raised for the construction of the
viaduct but the city turned down the j
proposition on account of the ex-!
pense of grading Main street!
through the ridge by .Marion Spawr's
property. A large portion of this
ridge has now been cut away to fur
nish crushed rock for street improve
mente and the street could he opened j
up at comparatively small expense.
The matter will be brought to the
attention of the. railroad officials and :
If they show a disposition to co-oper
ate, the viaduct is likely to be built, \
It is estimated that it could be con
structed for about $6000; nearly the
same sum as would be required for
the proposed road improvement.
PRECIPITATION BREAKS
RECORDS FOR _. > YEARS
Weather observations at the State
College show a total rainfall during
the month of .March just passed of an
even five inches, as against a 20
--year average for the same month of
2.2 inches. During the winter months
the records showed a total snowfall
of 98 Inches, while from September
to April the rainfall was 1.79
inches making a total precipitation
for the winter months of 21.59
inches. The average precipitation
during the months for he past 20
years is 16.73 inches, proving the
season to have been an exceptionally
wet one. The ground is .soaked to a
considerable depth, and the delay in
spring plowing occasioned by the
weather conditions is causing the
farmers considerable worry, especi
| ally hose who will plant spring
.rain.

Following Mr. Barrows' death at

took over thai charge for two years.
Later she took up the work of teach

In October of the past year her

NUMBER 26
BOHLER WILL NOT
ACCEPT NEW DEFER
*________
Tunis I town O. A. C. Position to Re
main as Head of Athletics at
W. S. C.
After .1 series of conferences with
President E. 0. , Holland. Athletic
Director J, Fred Bohler announced
Wednesday thai he would not ac
cept the position offered him as
director of athletics at Oregon Agri
cultural College. Mr. Bohler was
elected to the' position at the Corral'
lis Institution by the O. A. C. hoard
of regents at a meeting on Saturday
ami was notified immediately of his
selection. Following the' receipt of
the news a number of conferences
were held between President 'lol
land and Mr. Bohler, at which the
athletic director decided to tenia!:.
in his position.
In announcing thai he would re
main as athletic director here Mr.
Bohler made the following .state
ment: ' .
"Since the notice of my election to
the D. A. C. position appeared in the
papers a great deal of pressure has
been brought to bear upon me by
students, alumni and faculty who
urged that I remain here, and I
found it difficult to Ignore the
wishes of these friends. Then, too,
in my conferences with Prcsideit
Holland I learned something of his
policy in regard to the' department
of physical education, and In lew
of « hal the future promises 1 di 1
not feel justified In leaving a field
wit ii which I am acquainted for on
untried, as a new position always is."
Had he accepted the O. A. C. of
fer .Mr. Boh i would ha', had
charge of all athletics at. Ihe Ore
gon school, and his duties would
have Included coaching the basket
ball and track teams and raining
all he athletic teams. The offer
was an attractive one, Inasmuch as
training and athletic facilities at O.
A. C. are much better than here,
and the salary offered was several
hundred dollars In advance of the
salary Mr. Bohler receives here. It
is probable that the salary here will
lie raised by the' regents of the col
lege previous to the beginning of the
next school year.
Mr, Bohler has been at Washing'
ton State College lor the past eight
years, and as a trainer of athletes
there is no better in the west. Much
of the credit for the wonderful show*
Ing of he W. S. ('. loot ball team last
fall goes to Air. Bohler, in every
game on the hard schedule the W.
S. C. men proved to be In much bet
ter physical condition than their op
ponents, and the exceptional staying
powers of the W. S. C, men in the
big Brown game at Pasadena attract
ed the attention of athletics mentors
in all parts of the United States.
