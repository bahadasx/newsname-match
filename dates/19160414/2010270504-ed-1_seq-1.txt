'I'oithc Kepulijlcan Voters of-the Sixth
District: r
As u candidate for one of the Dis
trict Delegates to tho National Re
publican Convention from the Sixth
District, I have been asked many
times who I favored for president. I
have always frankly replied that I
Was personally for Charles E. Hughes,
and here are a few reasons why I am
for Mr. Hughes:
1st The people want him.
2nd Tho nation needs an able lead
er, one who will be trusted at homo
and respected abroad.
3rd -With Chief .Justice Hughes as
tho standard bearer, the party will bo
thoroughly united and boldy aggres
sive. Wo will havo nothing to explain
away, and nothing to defend or opolo
glzo for.
4th HIh nomination will not only
regenerate the party, but will strength
en every candidate on a county, state
and congressional Republican ticket,
fith I am profoundly Impressed with
tho view that the Natllonal and Inter
national Interests of this country de
mand that tho Republican' party take
over tho government.
We havo many great and good men
in our party and I believe that tho
party as a wliolo Is bettor qualified to
Dudgo than any '.individual and, If
elected as a delegate, I will carry out
to tho best of my ability tho Instruc
tlons from tho voters of tho party.
Very respectfully,
WILLIAM C. MAY.
