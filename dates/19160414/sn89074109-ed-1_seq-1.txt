The Farmers' Paper
VOLUME XII
Non Partisan League
Meeting Well Attended
First Political Meeting in Beach This Year
Drew Audience Composed Largely of
Farmers—Candidate for Governor
The afternoon meeting was
called to order with J. M. Still,
president of the local fanners ele
vator, presiding. After a short ad
dress in which he gave his appro
val of the movement, he intro
duced Mayor Brinton who gave
the address of welcome on behalf
of the business men who had rent
ed the opera house and turned it
over to the organization for the
occassion. Mr. Brinton for the
past two months had been speak
ing throughout the state on behalf
of the League, and he was right at
home welcoming the League
workers to Beach which he did in
a very forceful manner, saying
he was proud of the fact that a
Beach man made the organization
what it is today, the most talked
of movement in the middle west,
and that in welcoming the organi
zation to Beach he honed he spoke
for every business man in the
city.
Mr. Siill then introduced J.
Arthur Williams, another Lea
gue speaker, as the permanent
chairman of the afternoon meet
ing. Before introducing the next
speaker, Mi\ Williams outlined
the League program and from ap
plause given him it is very evi
dent that the farmers of the Gold
en Valley are heartily in accord
with the movement and its ob­

IN
Among Speakers
The first political gathering to
be held in Ihe city of Beach this
year was that of the Nonpartisan
League last Monday afternoon
and evening. About 200 local peo
ple, practically all farmers, at­
tended the afternoon gathering,
•while over .'100 from both city and
country attended the evening
meeting. It was one of the most
enthusiastic gatherings ever held
in the city and is evident that the
much praised and denounced or
ganization has its full share of
supporters in this locality.
When President Townley ap
peared on the platform at the eve
ning meeting, the cheering and
handelapping was so prolonged
that it became embarrassing for
the former Golden Valley resi
lient.

jects. Mr. Williams is a very good
speaker.
The treat of the afternoon, how
ever, was the speech of R. B. Mar
tin, formerly of Washington, but
now connected with the league,
who was next introduced. Mr.
Martin is by far the best speaker
ever introduced to a Beach au
dience according to remarks heard
about town since the meeting. Ho
drove home to his hearers the
righteousness of the movement
from (he viewpoint of the farmer:
the justice of the movement in the
interests of the mothers and the
boys and girls on the farm: the
fairness of tiie movement from
the standpoint of the North Dako
ta business man. His address was
both sad and humorous, and with
lightning rapidity he brought his
V.v!rers from tears to laughter.
Following Mr. Martin, Lynn
J. Frazier, of Hoople, the farmer
candidate for governor endorsed
by the League at the Fargo mass
meeting, was introduced, and he
told how he was called from his
farm near Grand Forks to Fargo,
and there learned that he was
wanted as the next governor of
the state. He pledged himself to
do his best as governor of all the
people of the slate if elected, and
if the Beach audience is an index
to state sentiment, there seems
little question but what he will be.
Although a graduate of the Uni
versity of North Dakota, Mr. Fra
zier is not an orator, but is a clear
talker and he let it be known
plainly where he stands regard
ing the League program and agri
cultural legislation which he says
the state needs and which the
coming generations of boys and
girls are entitled to. Mr. Frazier
closed the afternoon gathering
amid hearty applause from the
audience.
President Townley and William
Laivier, of Morton county, endors
ed by the League for attorney
genera!, arrived on No. and took
part in the evening meeting which
was presided over by Mr. Martin
one of the afternoon speakers.
Mr. Langer was the first man in
troduced when the evening meet­
ing opened and he gave a short
history of his fight in Morton
county for law enforcement. He
pledged himself to do all in his
power to assist in the League pro
gram, if elected, and explained
why the attorney general's office
was very important, in many
cases more important than that of
the governor's office. He was given
a rousing applause at the opening)
and close of his talk.
But when President Townley
was introduced all records were
broken and the cheers and ap-
es were prolonged. Mr. Townley
has developed into a very force
ful and clever speaker and he put
composed the larger part of the
audience.
Mr. Townley introduced Mr.
Frazier and he again gave a short,
plain and forceful talk on the cir
cumstances surrounding his be
coming a candidate, his views on
rural legislation and his pledge
to he governor of all the people if
elected.
(). M. Thomason closed the
meeting and he was the fun mak
er of !!ie entire program. For over
in hour he kept the audience in
laughter and applause. He told
why the business man should co
operate with the farmer in this
movement, and expressed hope
that they would and showed why
it would be to their advantage to
do so.
The meeting was a very suc
cessful one from every standpoint,
and all the League men expressed
themselves pleased at the manner
in which the city received them.
Thev left Tuesday morning for
Bismarck where they held two
meetings that afternoon and eve
ning.
Saturday night, Mayor Brinton
as a League speaker, will address
a meeting at Leo Kukowski's hall
northeast of Beach. This was an
