Washington. April 1 I. In both
houses of congress Mexican develop
ments were watched closely and ther
was an undercurrent of sentiment
chiefly among Republicans, that the
cm nargo on munitions of war every
where in Mexico should be enforced.
Chairman Stone of the foreign rela
tions committee, after conferring with
Secretary Lansing, said the state de
partment hid no information not
made public.
"The problem confronting this gov
ernment is how long it would be wise
to keep an expeditionary force in Mex
ico," said Senator Stone. "I hav
never believed that we would achievt
the capture of Villa. Diaz had a price
on Villa's head for years and could
not get him. I do not doubt that Car
ranza would like to get him, but he
has been unable to do so. Villa is in
bis own country and our soldiers are
in a difficult, unknown country. They
have succeeded in breaking s me of
Villa's bands and have accomplished
something. I was strongly in favor of
sending the expedition after Villa
whether it got him or not.
"But we have recognized the de
facto government in Mexico and
agreed to send an expeditionary force
into Mexico for a certain purpose. How
long: can we let that army stay In a
foreign country where friction al
ready exists and where more friction
is bound to develop? If we adhere to
our policy toward Mexico we cannot
keep the army there. To my mind the
only alternative to withdrawing the
iroops. sooner or later, is interven
tion." in Men in Bandit Baud.

Funstcn was endeavoring early today
to learn from General Pershing the
American side of the story of the fight

and every other available means of

was forced to fight for its life Wed

The premier stated that the same leg

Premier Bowser paid a tribute to
the work done by women of the coun

gone to the front and to carry on the

CITY DECIDES TO
ADVERTISE FOR
RIDS ON INTEREST
Commissioners Take Action on
Daily Balances Today.
Effort to Receive More for
Their Funds in Banks.
COUNTY IS GIVEN SETBACK
Topeka Bankers Say They Can
Pay Only 2 Per Cent Now.
New Rate Will Cost Shawnee
$1,600 in One Year.
In response to public sentiment in
the city and county for a larger rate
of interest on the daily balances in
the Topeka banks, two important ac
tions were taken at the court house
and at the city hall today.
The board of city commissioners
went on record in an effort to gain
a higher rate by officially proposing
to ask bids on the municipal funda.
The county commissioners were in
formed in letters from local financial
institutions that effective May 1 only
2 per cent would be paid on county
daily balances.
The contention arose from the reve
lation that the banks in Topeka pay
3 per cent to the state of Kansas, 3
per cent to the school board, 2 per
cent to the county and only 2 per
cent to the city.
The county commissioners were in
formed through communications from
six leading Topeka banks that after
May 1 it would be impossible for them
to pay more than 2 per cent on daily
balances. It is probable that at a
meeting soon of the board of county
commissioners the city's action in ad
vertising for bids will be followed out.
One of the county commissioners in
sinuated today that It might be ad
visable for the county to place funds
in the country banks in Shawnee out
side Topeka.
City's Action.
Behind closed doors, in the office
of Commissioner of Finance Wasson,
today a conference of all city com
missioners, as well as Mayor House,
was held regarding the action the city
was officially to take regarding the
rate of interest the city is receiving for
its dally balances from the banks. It
was decided to have Commissioner
Wasson direct the city clerk to adver
tise for bids for the use of the city
money, which he did.
After the meeting, which instructed
the city clerk to advertise for bids
for the use of the city's money. Wag
son was asked :
"Were all of the commissioners, as
well as the mayor, in accord with your
action this morning?"
"They were," he replied, "and they
were all here in this office at the con
ference." "Have you. within the past few days,
interviewed all of the bankers who
have on deposit in their banks city
money, asking them to increase the
rate of interest and pay the city at
least three per cent for the use of its,
money ?
"I have," was the reply, "and they
all turned me down."
"Did you let all of the commission
ers and the mayor know of the result
of your efforts, at this meeting this
morning ?"
"I did. and we all discussed the
fact."
"Knowing the attitude and opinion
of the various bankers as you state,
how do you figure that advertising for
bids will get the city more interest for
its money?"
Put Them on Record.
"Well, it's this way, we want to put
them on record," he said.
"Has it not been suggested to you
to introduce an ordinance to make it
mandatory that you or your successors
receive not less, than three per cent
for all money on daily balances, and
has not this suggestion come from
practical business men V he was
asked.
"Well. yes. that is so. but we all
thought this way better."
When the attention of Commission
er Porter was called to the fact that
Wasson had called on all of the bank
ers and had been turned down in his
request for more interest, he said :
"Officially I know nothing about that.
What I want is to get the bankers on
record, then we can go after them If
it is necessary-"
County Action.
Topeka banks, now paying two and
one-half interest on daily balances,
did not wait for the county commis
sioners to demand that the rate be in
creased to three per cent. Instead,
they got together and today showered
the commissioners with letters, an
nouncing that beginning with May X
they would pay only- two per cent in
terest on daily balances that they
would cut the rate one-half of one per
cent.
The action of the banks -was totally
unexpected by the county commission
ers. The first intimation they had
came in the morning mail in the form
of letters from six Topeka banks, all
following much the same form. The
arguments used in explaining the re
duction are the same in all the letters.
"Funny how the minds of all bank
ers run in the same channel." remark
ed a commissioner after the letters
had been opened.
Kffectivc May 1.
The letters, all announcing the cut
of one-half of one per cent beginnir
with May 1, are from the Merchants'
National bank, the Central National
bank, the German-American State
bank, the State Savings bank, the
Shawnee State bank and the Citizens
State bank.
The commissioners are expecting
similar letters from all other Topeka
banks with which they do business.
"How will you meet the bankers on
this proposition?" was asked of Fred
Nipps. chairman of the board of com
missioners. "I've known about it only five min
utes." he replied, "and want time to

affirm the story of the virgin
birth, the raising of Lazarus and
the story of Jonah and the whale,
were admitted to the presbytery.
Shown the United Press dispatch
concerning the action of the pres

"I believe the Bible from cover

has no right in the Presbyterian
pulpit. The world is going to hell
fast enough without help from the
pulpit. If all the preachers in
the United States take a stand
against literal construction of the

it as it is. I believe Jonah was
swallowed by the whale."
GOING INTO CAMP
Thirty Men From Battery A
Ordered to Fair Grounds.
Will Be in Charge of a Regu

A gunner's detachment of thirty
men from Battery A with two pieces,
of artillery and all the paraphernalia
of a real military encampment will gu
into camp at the fair grounds tomor
row. Under the direction of Sergeant
William H. Brady of the regular army,
thirty Topeka boys will live a soldier's
life for an indefinite period.
Lieut. Frank Thorpe of the Sixth
field artillery, will arrive Thursday.
April 20, to conduct an examination
for first class gunners.
When asked if the encampment had
any significance with regard to the
complication in Mexico. Captain Hit
refused to answer. Among members
of the battery Lieutenant Thorpe's
visit is interpreted as an effort on th"
part of the war department to get all
the K. X. G. in shape for field service
as soon as possible. This is the first
local encampment of the kind that the
battery has ever had and its occurs
rence at this time is regarded as siafr
nificant.

deavoring to get a long distance con
nection with Kansas City for the pur
pose of making arrangements for the
installation of a motor car on the
Leaven wort h-Topeka road. There id
no doubt about the installation of
such a car that will give Topeka i
morning service on that road, Mr.
Austin announced today.
"And it will open up a territory
closed to Topeka in years past," said
Mr. Austin. "Oskaloosa and Ozawkk1
people have been going either to
Leavenworth orKansasCity on accoun
of better train service. I don't believe
they will do this after a morning train,
which runs into Topeka, is put on the
road. The motor will leave Leaven
worth about S o'clock in the morning,
arriving in Topeka about 10 o'clock.
It will leave Topeka about 4:30 and
reach Leavenworth about 6:30
o'clock."

still sought today the principals who
originated, financed and directed the
alleged conspiracy.
They declared the eight prisoners
mainly employees of the North German-Lloyd
and Hamburg-American
Steamship company, were active only
in the execution of the plot by which
it is charged fires were started on 30
steamers. One man for whom the
federal agents are searching is Walter

Agricultural and Chemical company of
Hoboken, in whose factory the fire
bombs are said to have been charged
with explosive chemicals.

The scope of the investigation by de

alleged conspiracy to blow up ships
carrying munitions to the entente allies
broadened today to include various
other cities, particularly Savannah and
New Orleans.
Evidence that the plotters were ac
tive in Savannah and New Orleans and
probably other cities was said to have
been found in the deserted apartment
of Dr. Scheele.
The four men who were arrested
yesterday on the interned German
steamer, Friedrich der Grosse at Ho

trict Attorney Knox today, he said,
that they had been employed on the
ship making the bombs in addition
to their regular work, but declared
they did not know what the bombs
were to be used for. Carl Schmidt,
one of the four, admitted that about
3 0' bombs were manufactured and
that they were placed aboard each
vessel which had been marked for de
struction. FORMER TOPEKAN DEAD

here today on the American line
steamship St. Paul. It included affi
davits of the survivors and was part
of an exceptionally large amount f

sacks. The affidavits are those gath
ered by attaches of the American em
bassies in Paris and London.
Among the St. Paul's 585 passen
gers was Edward H. Huxley of E
glewood. N. J., president of the ('nited
States Rubber Export company of this
city, who was a passenger on the Sus
sex, escaping uninjured. Mr. Huxley,
after confirming previously cabled
news dispatches regarding the attacic
on the Sussex, stated positively mat
! from the hour that the vessel left the
British shore until the moment that
she was attacked and for nine hours
thereafter not another vessel was
I sighted except the destroyer which
came to the rescue.
Carried No Munitions.
I Mr. Huxley made this assertion in
connection with the text of Germany's
j note of April 10 to the state depart
! ment. citing an attack by a German
' submarine on an unnamed vessel in
' the vicinity of the Sussex at the hour
' when the latter met with mishap. Mr.
j Huxley also said he was positive the
Sussex carried no ammunition. The
German note declared that "a violent
explosion" on the ship which was tor
pedoed warranted "the certain conclu
j sion that great amounts of munitions
J were aboard."
When he and other passengers were
in the junior officer's room on board
the rescuing destroyer, Mr. Huxley
said a warrant officer who had talked
with the captain of the Sussex de
, clared that the captain had said he
had seen the wake of a torpedo. Mr.
Huxley showed a letter which he saio
had been written by Captain Thomas
Cn rroll. French embarkation officer
at Boulogne. France. It read:
"I have just helped take from the
poor Sussex, beached nearby, the bod
of a voman with a piece of a German
torpedo imbedded in her stomach."
I The Sussex had on board only three
military officers two French and
one Russian Mr. Huxley declared,
i It was understood that Mr. Huxley
planned to visit Washington to confer
with state department officials regard

GOOD CHANCE FOR
NEW RAILROAD IN
THIS TERRITORY.
.Maple Leaf and the Q Have
an Eye on 'l's.
Have Been Looking Over thj
L. T. & S. W. Line.
ONE OF THEM MAY BUY IT
Will Be Sold if Keoeher
Doesn't Make It Pay.
Would Be ecessarj to Built
From Meriden Junction.
Attracted by the more than f.T.OflO,
000 collected annually in freight and
passenger revenues by roads entering
Topeka. the Chicago & Great Western
and the Chicago. Burlington & Quincy
ar." considering seriously an extension
of their lines to this point, it is un
derstood here by persons in closS
touch with railway affairs. Both
lines now enter Leavenworth and ItS
known that they have seen representa
tives here within the last two months
to look "the ground" over.
In the event either of the roads
completes arrangements to enter the
city, it will be done through annexa
tion of the Leavenworth & Topeka
which has just gone into the h;i nds
of a receiver, it is said. Agents of the
Great Western it is known made an
inspection tour of the L. & T. Just
prior to its desertion by the Atchison,
Topeka & Santa F- and the I'nion Pa
cific, who according to railway men
held the line for years to withhold
from other roads a means of reaching
Topeka.
That the Atchison, Topeka & Santa
Fe and the I'nion Pacific are no
longer unwilling that an outside line
should obtain control of the Leaven
worth ft Topeka is admitted by repre
sentatives of the two lines. When a
receiver was asked for the L. T., at
torneys for the lines expressed them
selves as positive that the Leaven
worth & Topeka could not be made to
support itself from the revenues earn
ed on Its forty-seven miles of line be
tween Leavenworth a nd Meriden.
Probably Must Be BbML
Despite the expressed intention of
William A. Austin, receiver for the
Leavenworth & Topeka, to make the
line a paying proposition, railroad men
freely predict that eventually It must
be sold. In appointing Mr. Austin re
ceiver. Judge Pollock instructed him
that funds to meet the expense of
operating the railway must be obtain
ed from the road's revenues. Judge
Pollock further advised Mr. AunUti
that in ihe event this cannot be done,
he report to the court who will ask
the I'nion Pacific, on whose petitio?
the receiver was appointed, to amend
its original petition so as to ask for a
foreclosure and sale of the property.
In the event the Leavenworth ft
Topeka Is purchased by nrtn of the two
roads seeking to enter Topeka, It
probably would have to build a line
from Meriden to its terminal her. L.
& T. trains now reach here from Meri
den over the main line of the Atchi
son, Topeka A Santa Fe. By an agree
ment between the two lines the con
tract to operate L. & T. trains into T
peka over the Santa Fe can be termi
nated at any time on sixty davs no
tice. Just what terminal facilities a new
road could obta in here railroad men
are unwilling to say. That, however,
it is admitted, will be one of the big
gest problems that will face a railroad
seeking to extend its line to Topeka.
The possibility of another road's
reaching Topeka haw long been recog
nized by lines now operating into tffce
city, and Is said to be the principal
reapnn for the control of the L. A T.
by the Santa Fe and Cnion Pacific.
After sixteen years of guardianship,
however, at a loss of several hundred
thousand dollars, the two lines are
willing to quit.
