Indians Object
to Park Names
Petition Secretary Lane to
Restore Old-Time Tribal
Nomenclature
Tired of having "visitors for
a day" hurry av ay from the
Glacier park country back to
their eastern home and en
deavoring to steal the glory of.
having one of the everlasting
peaks in the great mountains
named for them, the Indians of
the Blackfeet council have ap
pealed to Secretary Franklin K.
Lane to put a stop to such prac
tices. There is a petition being
circulated now and numerously
signed by the Indians, calling
upon the secretary of the in
terior to wipe out all such
names and to restore to the map
the names that the first occu
pants of this section accorded
to them. They point out quite
forcefully their reasons for this
in the petition which reads as
follows:
Browning, Montana, Febru
ary 1, 1916,
Hon. Franklin K. Lane, Sec
retary of Interior, Washington
D. C.
"Dear sirs: We the undersigned
members of the Blackfeet
Council, for our tribes and for
ourselves, respectfully petition
that the names now used to in
dicate various topographic fea
tures within the eastern slope
of Glacier National Park, and
including the summit of the
range, be wiped off the map
and the names of our old time
chiefs and warriors substituted
therefor. The proposed change
is within keeping of the purpose
for which the National Park
was established.
"We did not learn until re
cently, sir, how generally the
white people have given their
names to the mountains, lakes
and streams; ours since OldMan
made the earth and placed us
here, and we are grieved that
they have done this. They have,
for instance, given the foolish
name, "Trick Falls," to the falls
of our long ago virgin woman
warrior, Running Eagle, and
to one of our most beautifnl
lakes, Beaver Woman's Lake,
they have given the name of a
wandering prospector, McDer
mott, who passed through our
country but a few years ago.
Only last summer a man from
the east—unknown outside his
own little town, asked that his
name be given to one of our
mountains, and that of his
daughter to a falls upon it,
giving as his reason therefor,
that this was his second visit to
the park. As he asked, so was
it done. That deeply grieved
us!
"Time was—and not so very
long ago, when we owned all
the country from the Saskat
chewan to the Yellowstone, and
from the summit of the Rockies
eastward for some hundreds of
miles. We desire to have some

Winter-Killing and Damage by
Cutworms to Winter Wheat
Experiment Station Gives Instructions as to How to
Distinguish Winter-Killing from Activities of
Worms, and Suggests Remedy
Reports are already coming to
the Experiment tation from sev
eral sections of the state that the
army cut orm which caused se
rious loss of winter wheat last
year is again doing damage. Re
ports of serious winter-killing of
wheat are also coming to u&.
Farmers are urged, therefore, to
examine their winter wheat fields
at once to see if the crop has been
killed out or is being destroyed.
How to Look for Cutworms
Look very carefully in the grain
fields for plants that have been
eaten by worms and search for
the small worms from a half inch
to an inch in length with the
usual cutworm appearance. They
are more easily found in the late
afternoon.
How to Look for
Winter-Killing
Plants that have died from
winter injury lie shriveled and
dead on the ground and may be
easily pulled up as the roots ar
dead and broken. Sometimes a
field may show a little evidence of
life and the plants take on a green
c."lor for a short time early in the
spring and then d i e down in
places so that the field has a
spotted iippearan'-e. Don't con
c ude that the crop has killed out
t,uuc . / .
«Auntil growth 18 fairly started in
11 , s . . , . ,
the vicinity as all winter wheat
plants look withered and dead
early in the spring.
To distinguish between cut
worm injury and winter-killing it
houid be borne in mind that
winter -killing has already b. en
done and that cutworm injury
is just beginning, .there should
be no oifficulty in making certain
of the cause of the damage if indi
vidual plants are closely examined.
The worms eat off the top of the
plant, while if killed by the se
vere winter the entire plant is
there but withered and dead.
What to Do for Cutworms
To meet the cutworm difficulty
and keep the loss from thir cause
at a minimum, the farmers should
start at once to carefully watch
their fields and keep this up till
the danger from the worms is
past. In this way they will be
able to detect at the earliest pos
One of the most successful
social events of the season was
given by Mrs. T. J. Larson on
Friday last at her hospitable
bungalow at the edge of town.
By two o'clock the first of the
forty or more invited guests
began to arrive. They found
the rooms of the artistic resi
dence beautifully decorated
with bluebirds. They were
painted on curtains, on napkins
—everywhere the bluebird was
in evidence. On the edge of
each drinking glass perched a
perfectly balanced bluebird.
Progressive games were play
ed at nine different tables. Mrs.
Taft and Mrs. VanOrmer tied
for honors in winning most
games. The prize finally went
to Mrs. Taft, who was presented
with a very handsome bluebird
pin. The consolation prize, a
pair of bluebird beauty pins,
was won by Mrs. Jim Miller.
After a most pleasant after
noon of games and sociability,
a delicious four-course lunch
was served by the hostess, with
the assistance of Mrs. E. Lar
son, Mrs. M. Larson and Miss
Mildred Anderson. The guests
then departed, each one carr
ing away lasting recollectio;
of the unique party, and —
sible moment the presence of the
worms in injurious numbers. Ii
is not sufficient to recognize the
difficulty after the destruction is
well under way. If the state en
tomologist had been informed
earlier last year, in many cases
much gia'n could have been saved.
Poisoned bran mash, recommend
ed by the Experiment Station last
ysar, was very extensively used
and was uniformly reported to be
satisfactory.
Grain growers should be pre
pared in advance to control the
worms if they come. In view of
the fact th'»t large amounts of
bran or shorts and Paris green
may be called for on short notice,
in any neighborhood, farmers
should have in m ; nd where they
can buy and get quick delivery.
Send t > the Experiment Station
for circular on cutworms.
What to Do for
Winter-Killing
As soon as the farmer is certain
that fields or parts of fields have
been killed out he should plant
some spring crop. If the field is
in tair condition the crop may be
drilled in at once, while if the soil
is baked or was poorly prepared
last year it may be wise to disk
before seeding.
Marquis spring wheat has done
well in Montana and this may be
seeded where the winter wheat
was killed out, at the rateof from
three to four pecks per acre,
Other spring wheat varieties
which have given fair satisfaction
are .Scotch Fife, Bluestem and
Kubanka; the latter is a Maca
roni wheat. Other crops such as
early-maturing oats, likt- the Six
ty-Day, seeded at the rate of fifty
pounds to the acre, or White
Hulless or some other early-ma
turing barley, seeued at the same
rate, are fairly good. Flax, seed
ed at the rate of from rourteen to
eighteen pounds per acre, has
been used in some localities.
Of all the crops here mentioned
Marquis spring wheat is consider
ed the best. In many cases only
parts of fields have been killed
out and where Marquis wheat is
planted, its high milling qualities
make it lit in with the good mill
ing varieties of winter wheat
which are commonly grown.

FARMERS STATE BANK
Rural Credit
Bill Introduced
Plan Based on Landschaft
System of Germans for
Land Banks
There may be a better rural
credit system than Germany's
Landschaft, but at any rate none
has a longer record of success
ful operation. Since a bill to
adapt the Landschaf t system to
the needs of the United States
lias been introduced by Senator
Sheppard of Texas, it is worth
while to give it renewed con
sideration.
The system has been in suc
cessful operation in Germany
for 147 years. One day Fred
erick the Great was discussing
financial matters with Herr
Buring, a Berlin merchant who
was his financial advisor. They
agreed that fundamentally the
prosperity of a country depend
ed on the prosperity of its
farmers.
Out of the desire to help ag
riculture by soundly facilitating
rural credit grew the Lands
chaft. Senator Sheppard says
that "it touched the land and
the land was gold."
The farmers of each district
incorporate themselves into a
Landschaft. Each member,
thereupon, executes a mortgage
on his farm and exchanges it
for the collective bond issued
by the Landschaft. The bond
is offered for sale without any
further guarantee. There are
about thirty of these organiza
tions doing business in Germany
today and their out-standing
bonds aggregate not far from
nine hundred million dollars.
No Landschaft has any cap
ital stock or pays any dividends.
The members may borrow up
to sixty per cent of the product
ive xalue of the land at from
three to tour per cent. The
bonds mature in from forty to
seventy-live years. No Lands
chaft has ever failed, and all
their maturing bonds have been
paid.
The whole system is operated
under rigid Government super
vision. The members are col
lectively liable for any defaults
or losses. No mortgage and
therefore, no member, is accept
ed, until the property that se
cures the mortgage has been re
liably appraised. The title is
so carefully searched that there
is no question about it when
the mortgage is accepted. The
organization has the most sum
mary powers of forclosure.
It is urged against the adopt
ion of the Landschaft system
in this county that, before it
could be made workable, the
nomestead and other laws of
the States would have to be
changed or repealed. The ad
vocates ol the system insist
that changes like these would
have to be made under almost
any system of rural credits.
Whether or not the Lands
chaft is the best rural credit
system for American farmers,
it is suggestive of possibilities
for the convenience of the
farmer.
