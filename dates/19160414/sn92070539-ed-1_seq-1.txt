dockets ever known in Luna
county was presented to the
April grand jury, which met in
Deinlng April 10th. The charg
oh to be investigated ran go all
the way from inurdur to larceny.
Up to the present twenty-four
cases have been submitted to
the grand jury, and the consider
ation of these cases will take
up suvcral days, so it is not like
ly that the petit juries will get Us
work until the middle of thu
week.
Six murder charges will be
presented to the grand jury, the
accused beingtFrnneisco Acosta,
charged witli killing Geronimo
Galbuu at Spalding; Guadalupe
M. Posos, who is charged with
the murder of Francisco Girois:
Juun Sunchez and Pablo Sanchez
who are charged with tho mur
der of .las. T. Dean in the Villa
raid on Columbus; Walter Lefler,
who is charged with the shoot
ing of a Mexican boy; and Jesus
Hius, the twelve year old Mexi
can boy who was wounded in tho
battle ut Columbus. In view of
Rios' youth and the fact that ho
is crippled for life, it is doubtful
whether he will be brought to
trial. '
Acosta is one of thu men who
participated in the jail break at
Doming, which resulted in thu
killing of Sheriff Stephens. He
was acquitted of complicity in
the killing of Stephens in order
that he might be tried for the
Galium murder.
Other" ciises to bo submitted "lis
thu grand jury charge larceny,
burglary, felonious assault and
horse stealing. A number of
civil cases nro also down foi trial,
but these will not he reached uu
til the criminal docket has been
taken care of, nnd.it is not im
probable that some of them may
be held over until the next term
of court;
May Collect Insurance
Those who lost their property
in tho tire the morning of the
Villa raid have been grently en
con raged by lawyers who believe
that the insuranco companies
can bo forced to pay. Lemmon
& Payne have placed their case
with their attorney and all who
lost in the raid have offers from
lawyers, who are willing to take
tho cases on a preccntagc basis
Some of tho losers have said that
in case they failed to collect their
insurance that it was absolutely
useless to carry insuranco at all
and that they would nevur take
out another policy.
It is possible that damages
can be collected from tho Mexl
can government sometime, but
not in the lifetime of the loser
I from thu present outlook.
a dwelling house back of the
Peach restaurant. A large num
ber of new buildings aro being
erected, though most of them
are temporary structures, the
owners trying to provide means
of taking care of what business
comes their way. H. S. Carter,
of Waterloo, has purchased a lot
between the Slsco and Moore &
Moore buildings, and is erecting
a building which he will uso as
quarters for a grocery. He ex
pects to put up a substantial
building soon. Tho business
section of town lias been greatly
improved In appearance by the
work of sign painters who have
been kept busy for several days
sticking on now slims.
A Correction
In last week's Courier wo
stated that the Elliott well was
the only straight hole in tho val
ley down to the dupth of 450
feet. An investigation revealed
that there were several and wo
gladly make the correction in
justice to the well drillers. We
had no intention of injuring any
one or mis stating facts. The
deepast wells in the valley have
been crooked, but several have
been put down as deep as 500
and 000 feet without getting out
of tho perpendicular line.
Installing Soda Fountain
The Columbus Drug Company,
who has purchased thu Miller
Drug Store, is preparing to in
stall a large soda fountain. P. K.
Lemmon, Jr., a meinour of the
linn, was in El Paso lirst ot the
week and bought the fountain,
which, when installed, will be a
vory elaborate drink stand.
It will arrive within a short time
and It will be only a matter of n
few days until they will be pre
pared to give the thirsty public
anything it may desire on tho
order of a soft drink.
To Remove Debris
"Tho Willing Workers" which
is Mr. Stlvison's Sunday School
class of young ladles, nro going
to raisu tho money to have thu
debris removed where the build
lugs wcro burned during the
raid. It is an unsightly place
and its effect Is perfect horror,
We need and want a nice clean
town, this is a worthy cause
nnd deserves help from all our
citizens.
Tho Willing Workers will have
a stand across from the picture
show, Friday and Saturday
afternoons, nnd will sell soda
water, sandwltches and pie.
Help the good cause.

Six Prisoners Brought In
The six Villista prisoners
brought to tho border Thursday
under heavy guard havo been
Identified positively by soldlors
and townn)coplo as having par
ticipated In the raid on Colum
bus, March l)th.
It was determined ulso that
one of thu prisoners, who had
claimed to bo a Carranclsta
soldier captured by Vi Un, was a
member of Villa's band when
it raided Columbus, having de
serted the do facto troops.
It was announced the men will
be held hero pending an invest!
gation as to tho legal steps to
be taken In prosecuting them.
Inclement weather conditions
hamper wircl ess communica
tion witli tho front, but military
authorities hero expressed no
concern and asserted that Gen
eral Pershing probably is push
ing his campaign rupidly farther
into tho interior of Muxico, and
that it is possible that some of
the troops aro operating on the
Durango border.
Military men of rank hero say
freely they believe tho conclusion
of the campaign is yet months
away. Few of them take stock
n the isossibility of the expedi
tionary force being withdrawn.
Much interest, however, is mani
fested in thu proposals to in
crease the force, it being point
ed out that the line of communi
cation now is more than four
hundred miles long.
Wet and Dry Fight In Deming
Demlng is bang up against a
"wet" and 'dry" tight. Tho
prohibition forces sent out with
their petition immediately after
the election of trustees and al
ready havo enough signers to
call nn election. The petition
will be presented nt tho first
regular meeting of the trustees
61 Deming nnd the election will
probably take place early in
June.
The precipitating of the con
flict came as n complete surprise
to tho "wots" nnd up to the
present time they hnve been un
able to gather their disorganized
forces. Tho name of it number
of persons that have been prom
inent defenders of the saloons in
the past nro on the petition and
it looks to the enthusiastic "drys'
like a sure victory.
Many Attend Court
Several of thu Columbus peo
ple .ire in Deming this week,
Edwin Dean is a member of the
trrand lur.v. and Jolly Garner.
T. A. Hulsey and many others
are present as witnesses. P. K.
Lemmon, Jr., J. L. Greenwood,
Sam Ravel and B. M . Reed wore
up to attend to business matters.
Suvcral cases in which the Co
lumbus people aro interested
will bo brought up at this term
and it is likely that this will be
tho longest session ever held in
Luna county.
Moves Into New Quarters
Johnson Bros., who have had
charge of the Lodge Pool Hall
for- the past few weeks, havo
moved into the building opposite
tho Frost Hardwaro Store. D
J. McCauley, owner of tho
Lodgo building, is installing
set of tables in his building and
will shortly be open for business
and will havo a complete stock
of tobacco, cigars, soft drinks,
candles, etc.
From the Douglas, Arizona
Dispatch, March 7th, forty-eight
hours before Villa raided Colum
bus.
United States cavalry from
Columbus to Nnco were thrown
into activity yesterday and last
night when information, aparont
ly authentic, told of Villa's plans
to raid into tho United States
near Columbus, N. M., In accord
ance with tho Plan of San Diego,
under which Pascual Orozco and
lis organized bands terrorized
the Texas border Inst fall.
Reports of Villa activity, on
both the American and Mexican
side of tho border, yesterday
ndicatcd that the rebel leader
had formed a defensive as well
as offensive alliance with Felix
Diaz and that his (Villa's) arrival
on the border would be the
signal for the crossing of any
number of Mexicans from this
side to join his cause.
Importing Beef Cattle
Reed and Bourgeois this week
brought twenty-nine head of
steers from Mexico, also bought
about 150 head from Mexicans,
the Mexicans bringing them
ucross the line. The cattlo were
in fine shape and they have al
ready sold some of them to the
local butchers. They do not
expect to grazo them, but will
resell as soon us they can find
the buyer.

E. C. Kniftin Is getting things
in shape now to start a deep

He has the casing and lumber
on the ground, and he expects to
start drilling within the next
few days.
The Wilson-Farnsworth leases
expired by limitation on April 7,
and Mr. Kniflln has taken up
several of them. Ho now has
plenty of land under his control,
and feels justifiable in making a
thorough test.
It will now be only a matter
of a few weeks until we know
whether there is anything doing
in the oil business for us. Mr.
Knlftin is arranging to put down
three or four different holes and
if there is any of the black iluid
in the valley he will be sure to
find it.
Newsboy Champion in Town
"Newsy" Bernard, who hails
originally from San Diego, was
In Columbus yesterday for the
purpose of issuing a challenge to
the soldiers stationed here, hop
ing to match himself for an
exhibition sparring match with
some of the soldiers stationed
here. He enters tho ring af 122
pounds. Bernard is now mak
ing his home in Columbus, wher
lie hopes to get a scrap. Sam
Riave, of Chicago, his mnnager
is also located in Columbus at
the present time and h letter
addressed to him 'general
delivery" will obtain the desired
result.
Bernard claims the title of
"western newsboy champion,"
having met and put away a long
series of tallent in the coast
states. He has fought Harry
Atwood, Jimmy Fox, Kid Julian
and many others, according to
the clippings in his possession.
Would Change State's Name
Every one whom we have heard
express an opinion on the ques
tion of changing the name of the
state, without exception, agree
that the present name is a "hoo
doo" of the most gigantic propor
tion. While east Mr. Gamel met
with the statement from whole
salers that they did not care Us
ship goods to the Joyce-Pruit
company because they had con
siderable trouble with the last
shipment made "down in that
country." It developed they
had shipped goods to Mexico.
Many others have received let
ters from their relatives In the
east begging them to leave Mex
ico for they will surely be massa
cred if they stay here. Among
these may be mentioned Mr. and
Mrs. Moberly, of Otis. We hear
u great deal about how impossi
ble it would be to agVeo on an
other name, but if the state were
to be named "Columbus" the
Spanish- American clement
would feel complimented and
the truely patriotic American
could not object. Then, It
will be necessary to choose n
namo that will meet with thu
least opposition and no other
name could bo thought ot that
would be as suitable, for there Is
no state at present with a namo
anything like it and it has been
tho opinion ot many that Colum
bus should have been honored
long ago by at least ono st
given the name of tho great dr
covcrer of tho western' hemls'-J
phere. By all means let us
I change tho
namo! Carbibad
Current.
