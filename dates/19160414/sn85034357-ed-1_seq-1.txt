Democrats Elect Delegates and
Commend Administration of
Two Distinguished Mem?
bers?List of Delegates.
The Democrats of the county met
here in mass-meeting Tuesday and se?
lected delegates to the State conven?
tion to be held in Roanoke.
There was present a representative
body of those who profess the Demo?
cratic faith from all sections of the
county.
Democratic County Chairman O. E.
Hopkins called the meeting to order,
and made a short speech, outlining
the reason for the meeting, and bio
many great reforms the dominant
party has inaugurated and carried
out during the past three years of
Democratic rule in Washington.
Among the many great reforms he
referred particulnry to the curren?
cy legislation, in which Virginia's dis?
tinguished son Carter Glass, played a
prominent part. Mr. Hopkins was
full of the Democratic spirit of op?
timism, and his remarks were force?
ful and to the point. ^
"Whenever you work for tho cause
of Democracy," he said, "you are
working Tor the wellfaro of the whole
people. The Democrats have a great
(leal to be proud of?they have placed
in the White House the greatest man
that has occupied that exalted posi?
tion."
Chairman Hopkins stated that the
object of the meeting was to elect
delegates to the Ronnoke convention,
where delegates to the National con?
vention will be chosen. Ho stntcd
that the county was entitled to 1?
delegates?5 from Clear Fork Dis?
trict, three from Jeffersonvillc and 2
from Maiden Spring. Mr. Hopkins
suggested that the number of dele?
gates be doubled, giving each delegate
a half a vote each. The Clear Fork
District and Jeffersonville District de ?
cided to appoint doubly as many del?
egates as suggested. Clear Fork,
therefore, selected twenty and Jeffer?
sonville twelve.
Dr. L. J. Stump, of Pocahontas,
was elected chairman of the meeting.
In accepting the place, Dr. Stump
recalled the fact that Pocahontas can
always be counted on for over a hun?
dred Democratic votes, and that the
Democrats of his town had never been
found wanting, when election day
comes around. Dr. Stump showed
that he was familiar with procedure
of conventions, and made an excellent
presiding officer.
As is customary, the delegates were
?-elected by districts, and were as fol?
lows:
Clear Fork District
M. C. Smith, E. V. Garrett, J. W.
Shannon, George Harrisson, E. King

ilege of casting their proportiontlc
part of the vote of their magisterial
district.
Administration of Governor Stuart
Heartily Endorsed.
Judge S. C. Graham offered the fol?
lowing resolution endorsing the ad
ministration, which was unanimously
adopted:
"Resolved, that we heartily endorse
tho course and public administration
of Governor Henry C. Stuart since he
has occupied tho exalted position of
the foremost official of Virginia's
Executive Department. He has been
open and frank in all his dealings,
private and public, since he has beeen
Governor of Virginia, and when he
knows the opinions of the people ns
expressed by the ballot box, he wns
courageously carried them out, and we
feel assured that he will continue to
do so. His personal frankness in all
his official dealings is to be com?
mended and by his public acts the
people know and will continue to
know that they can expect and will
receive his well matured acts and best
judgment for their welfnre.
Endorse Administration of President
Wilson.
Mr. V. L. Sexton, of Graham, read
this resolution in which tho adminis?
tration of President Wilson was en?
dorsed :
Be it resolved, that we, the repre?
sentatives of the Democratic party of
Tazewell county, Virginia, in mass
meeting assembled, here reaffirm our.
allegiance and devotion to the princi?
ples of Democratic government, for?
mulated by Thomas Jefferson and en?
forced by a long nnd illustrious line
of Democratic Presidents, reaching its
zenith of virtue, strength and perfec?
tion under the undaunted nnd bril?
liant leadership of Woodrow Wilson,
who by unselfish patriotism, profound
wisdom and manly courage has placed
tho Democratic party in complete
chnrgo and control of our National
Government, and who has, with equal
ease and diplomncy, shielded nnd pro?
tected the people of these United
States from the horrors and ravnges
of the greatest war the world_ has
ever known, without sacrificing either
principal or honor, and especially do
we commend his courso relative to
the situation in Mexico, which, on nc
count of its close proximity, conflict?
ing internal interests, has proven the
most delicate nnd difficult problem
with which the administration has
had to deal, but the successful ter?
mination of which, we firmly believe,
will soon be nssured by the capture
nnd execution of that untiring ban?
dit and wholesale murderer, Fran?
cisco Villa; nnd, believing that the
Clin
continued peace and prosperity of this
great nation is in jeopardy, by reason
of the situation abroad, and believing
in his unselfish patriotism and in his
abundant ability to still keep our
feet in paths of peace and pleasant?
ness, thereby insuring prosperity and
happiness, be it further resolved, that
we, hero and now, renew and reassert
our allegiance, both to the party and
its undaunted and matchless leader,
and pledge ourselves to use all hon?
orable means and influences to secure
his nomination nnd re-election to the
office of Chief Executive of this great
nation."

Chicago Convention.

CHURCH WORK ON CAVITT'S
CREEK.
Editor the News: I shall inform
you of our church work here at Cav
att's Creek and shall be glad indeed
if you will please make this known to
others through the Clinch Valley
News.
The Sunday School of Cavitt's Creek
' Union church is preparing Easter ex?
ercises, to be rendered on Sunday
morning, April 3rd, service beginning
at 10 o'clock. Immediately after the
the Sunday school services in the
same hurch the Rev. W. W. Yost will
preach an Easter sermon. Rev. Mr.
Yost has been faithfully preaching
in this church once each month for
more than two years.
Very few have shown him their
appreciation in the way of financial,
aid or even with their presence.
Our Sunday School has prevented
from entire disbandonmeiit during the
winter months by interest and atten?
dance of only a very few faithful
members.
May wo not be disappointed in our
hopes for a deeper interest shown
and good attendance during the Bpring
and summer months.
Everybody is invited to attend the
Easter services in the church and we
ask the members of the community
and others wdio desire to bring a
pound or more of groceries, etc, that
we may give Brother Yost a generous
pounding to show our appreciation of
services rendered to us. He has a
regular nppointmcnt here for each
month.
Rev. R. Homer Anderson, who has
charge of the Burkc's Garden and
Tazewell pastorate, preached a few
times in the afternoons in this Union
church last fall. We hope he will be?
gin preaching here again soon.
MRS. CHAS. SLUSS.
THE FERTILIZER QUESTION,
(By James L. Montague, County Ag?
ricultural Agent.)
More is said and less is known, about
fertilizers than any other agricultural
commodity which has as large a field
of usefulness. The increase in price
of fertilizers should cause many of
the farmers to make a more careful
study of the ingredients which are
bought in commercial fertilizers, but
such education is costly.
When buying fertilizers it is well
to consider a few rudamcntal facts.
Potash can hardly be secured at
all. It is the least important of the
three plant foods?potash, nitrogen,
nitrogen or phosphorous, this being
especially true where soils contain
clay. The only source for the farmer
-his year is his wood ashes. Keep
chem dry. Nitrogen costs about 20c
;jcr pound. That is about $40.00 per
ton for each 1 per cent of nitrogen ?
dded. Where a rotation including
clover is used, little attention need
be paid to nitrate fertilizers. If used
t all, this fertilizer pays best when
applied to meadows.
Phosphoric acid in bone "meal costs
6 l-2c per pound. In 16 per cent acid
phosphate it costs a little less than
5 8-10c per pound. To economize on
the use of bone meal, the following
is susggested: Apply 16 per cent,
acid phosphate broadcast on corn
land. If corn is followed with oats,
or wheat alone, use the same fer?
tilizer as for corn. Wen the land_ is
seeded to small grain and grass, give
an application of equal parts of bone
meal and acid phosphate. The advan?
tage of bone meal is its lasting ef?
fects which help the grass. Where
the meadows are top-dressed with
manure or acid phosphate, the bone
mean can well be omitted. Ths use
of lime in any of its forms will also
allow us to replace bone meal with
acid phosphate. "Dissolved" or "treat?
ed" bone should never be bought, as it
is virtually the same things as acid
phosphate and costs much more.
Steamed bone meal is quicker availa?
ble thaf? the raw bone.
To get the best results from any
fertilizer, the land should be well
prepared as the final yield of a crop
depneds upon many factors, as season,
moisture, cultivation, diseases, in?
sects, amount of plant food present,
etc.
? Don't buy fertilizer by the "Brand"
on the bag. Tho composition of many
brands have been changed this year.
Look for tho analysis and not the
brand. The analysis guarantees; the
brand merely is a pleasing trade
name.

A conference was held here lost
week between the saloon keepers of

the conclusion was reached that it
would be futile to attempt to contest
legality of Witten-Shumute law in
reference to the saloons closing on the

(Communicated.)
In the paper read by Miss Bowon it
was stated that Wia. Pearsons was

tain. Reliable information is to the
elfeet that he was killed at Cross
Lanes, in West Virginia.?Clinch Val?

"It is presumed that our complimen?
tary contemporary was also "reliably"
informed that young Parsons name
was "Pearsons," that Cotton Hill is
"Cotton Mountain" and that the good
people of Cross Lanes were separated
from the Old Dominion during the
Revolutionary war. The skirmishes at
Cross Lanes nnd Coaton Hill were
parts of a continuous engagement, nnd
we cannot see that historical nccurn
cy requires thnt the exact, spot nnd
date of young Parson's demise be fix?
ed. But if those interested think oth?
erwise, we suggest that the Clinch

If tho "Editor" was so far wrong
why was "Cross Lanes" substituted
for "Cotton Hill" in the manuscript
before publication? It was slated by
the "historian," "a young man of our
town wdiose modesty prevents the
mention of his name," thnt Mr. Par?
sons was killed at Cotton Hill. When
read by Miss Bowen on Tuesday night
the place was still Cotton Hill. On
Wednesday the editor wrote bis little

sarcastically, placed in the same cate?
gory with great historians, some of
whom he was likely to crowd "off the

seems again to have prevented "the
mention of his name." But, behold!

was published Cross Lanes was sub?

Killed While Sleeping.
Three persons were killed, one per?

less seriously hurt at the Nemours
plant of the Du Pont Powder Com?
pany, eight miles from Bluofild, on
Wednesday morning at .'{?.?JO o'clock,
when 4,000 kegs of black powder ex?
ploded. The damage to the plant is
estimated at $100,000. Howard M??
lheim, of Tip Top, who was on the
night shift at the plant, was blown to
pieees, and Calvin H?tts, u watchman,
was injured seriously.
Two Hoys Killed While Sleeping.
Two boys, George and Key Cr.iw ?
ford, age about 12 and 14 years
asleep in their homes about a quarter
of u mile from the explosion, were
crushed to death by a lurgo pioeo of
concreto which was blown through
the roof of the home by (he force of
the explosion. The two boys word
.students in the Nemours High School,
of which Prof. Dwight. Hurley, of
this town, is principal.
A Bluefleld special to the Roniioko
Times says:
With a irreal, roar, as if a mighty
earthquake had broken loose, the big
powder plant of the Du Pont De No-1
mours Powder Company at Nemours,
W. Vn., about eight miles west of Ibis
city, blew up Ibis morning at 11:20,
wrecking the entire plant, which was
a very valuable one, blowing an im?
mense hole in the earth, and killing
three people.
The shocks were felt in this city
and bouses rocked on their founda?
tions, some windows being broken.
Night, watchman Calvin H?tt is
suffering with concussion of the brain
but miraculously escaped with his
life, as be was near the building at
the lime of the explosion. The build?
ings destroyed were the corning mill,
the glazing and pressing mills, und
nnd the bomb proof pack house.
The bomb proof building was full of
powder. This building was on rein?
forced concrete with walls several
feet, in thickness and was built, as
substantial as it. was possible to make
It. was lorn to pieees and one piece |
of concrete weighing about, five tons
was blown a distance of live hun?
dred yards. The company houses
were located some distance from the
wrecked plant, and while they sus?
tained some damage, no lives wore
lost nnd no serious damage done. An
immense rock weighing three thous?
and pounds was thrown a distance id'
live hundred feet and completely bur?
ied in the ground. Two half-way
houses were used to store the over?
flow from the other houses.
According to information from the
foreman, three thousand kogS of pow?
der blew up, worth $1.50 a keg,
bringing the total loss in powder and
buildings dsotroyod up to $100,000.
The cause of the explosion is un?
known.
Of the poclinr incidents and mirac?
ulous escapes is recorded the fact
that, under a small house entirely de?
stroyed, a litter of pups were lo?
cated. They were left entirely un?
harmed. Close by also was a Ford
automobile which came out. unseat li?
ed, yet it was only fifteen feet, from
whore hundreds of kegs of powder
went. up.
The scene around where the plant
was located is one of desolation and
nothing can be seen now of the for?
mer buildings but an immense bole
in the ground.
The plant was built, in 11)01, ami in
1010 a minor explosion occurred in
which three persons were killed.
Outside of this no serious explos?
ions have occurred until today.
Mathcna Buried al Tip Top Yesterday
Tip Top, Vn., April 111.---Howard
Mathcna, 24 years old, single, son of
Stophcn Mathcna of this place, was
blown to pieces in an explosion at the
Dupont powder works at Nemours on
yesterday morning. Several other
people in the vicinity were more or
less injured. Two children of a Mr.
Crawford, one-fourth of a mile away,
were killed in their beds by a large
piece of concrete, which was blown to
the house by the explosion. The
fragments of the body of Mathcna
are being prepared for interment by
an undertaking firm in Bluefleld, and
will bo buried here today. Mathcna
was the only man in the building at
the lime of the explosion. The Ma
thena boy worked in the glazing
room, nnd would have been relieved
by another man in ten minutes of
tho time the explosion occurred. Two
brothers-in-law, Will Tato and Kd
Barrett, worked at the plant and had
been there with their families for
several years. It is understood that
Mathcna carried insurance, payable
to his mother.
Parties from Tip Top, who were in
the Falls Mills section yesterday re?
port that the company will began re?
building the destroyed buildings at
once, and expect to be ready to begin
work again within the next four
months.

Not Felt at Pocahontas.
Pocahontns, April 13.?The blow?
ing up of the powder mill at Nemours
was close enough to Pocahontas to do
considerable damage, but the moun?
tain evidently broke the force of the
explosion, for there was not n house
damaged; in fact, a large majority
of the people here knew nothing "of
it until after day, ns it did not arouse

two miles and n quarter in a direct
line from here to Nemours, but sev?
eral mountains intervene. The first
two explosions produced luminous
flame, and the light was sufficient to
penetrate the rooms of the dwell?
ings. The third was a blue light, ant'
entirely different from the others.
The first explosions were decidedly
tho heaviest, the third being much
weaker. Graham reports hearing -1
explosions, but only three were heard
here. Mr. Mathenu, who was blown
to atoms was a Tazewell man. and
the Crawford children who were kill?
ed by the rock falling through the
roof while they were asleep, lived In
Pocahontas before going lo Nemours,
so we understand.

ISLOT MACHlM
KNOCKED OUT
Stringent Law Now in Effect
Relative to Any Kind of Gume
of Chance?Jail Penalty
Coos With Violution.
Some of the morctranta of the coun?
ty would bo very much surprised if
they would wiiKo up in juil somo
bright spring morning, but just such
n ining is liKcly to happen. The law
previous thai, any poruon keeping or
uxmoitiiig, or wno is mioreateu in
Koopiiiu ut uxnibuing, buk mucmnes,
atui i no iiho, in uiu operation of winch
A?i teLibfti?iWi' 01 cnunco enters,
Bhnll be punished both by imprison?
ment in tue county and by a line. The
least, imprisonment under the law is
lifteen days in jail, and it is compul?
sory on the Justico or jury trying
the case to impose the jail sentence.
It is reported tlmt quito a num?
ber of the morchnntu of tho county,
restaurant Keepers and other busi?
ness men, are Keeping and exhibit?
ing s.ot machines, wneeia and the
IlKO in the operation of which some
element of cuanco enters. It seems
that some of the peopiu are under
the impression that, so long as the
person putting Ins money in thu ma?
chine gets something of value each
time, it is alright to provide for pre?
miums to the lucky persons, but in
this they will be sadly mistaken on
a trial of tho case. A premium or
inducement of no kind can bo offered.
At the lust term of court Judge Keg
ley upheld a jail .sentence on a chaw?
ing gum slot machine operator when
the person putting in his nickel be?
forehand knew just what ho was go?
ing to gel, on tho ground that there
was held out an inducement that the
next limo the poison putting up the
money might get a premium in ad?
dition to the one package of gum.
Counsel for the defendant contended
that each lime a person put in mon?
ey it was a separatu and distinct
transaction, and in as much as he
knew before hand what he was go?
ing to gel. there was no element of
chance in it, hut the court upheld Hie
contention of tho Commonwealth's
Attorney that all transactions wero
connected and that the premiums that
might, be gotten later on were thu in?
ducing cause. So, Mr. Slot Machine
Man, you had better get rid of your
machine as possession thereof is a
prima facie violation of law, and Hut
presumption is against you oven with
it idle in your possession.
At the April term of tho Circuit,
nut. of Wise ninety-seven indict?
ments were returned, and it is said
that the larger part of them worn
against, parlies who bad slot mac?
hines, punch boards, etc., in their
stores.
WILL Til Kit K It 10 A SPECIAL
TEltM OK COURT?
Several of till! PocuhoiltOS and
Clear Kork District citizens attend?
ed tho meeting of the Hoard of Su?
pervisors on Tuesday in tho interest
of mi early commencement of road
improvement under tho recent bond
issue. Un the motion of t.heso citi?
zens the Hoard of Supervisors enter?
ed an order requesting Judgo Kog
ley to forthwith call a special term of
court and confirm tho recent election
in order that the bonds might bo is?
sued and sold without delay. How?
ever, there is some doubt as to wheth?
er or not the court can net on the
matter at a special term called for
that prupOBO. Tho bond isBUo law
provides that in easo tho people vote
in fnvor of issuing tho bonds, " tho
Circuit Court shall, at Uh next term,
enter of record an order requiring
tho Supervisors of the county to
proceed at their next meeting to
carry out the wishes of tho votors
as expressed at thu said election."
The question of law presented is,
does the expression that tho court
shall enter said order "at its^noxt
term" moan tho next term fidW by
law, or does it mean any Bpocinl torm
that the court might call for the
purpose? Tho matter has been re?
ferred to Judgo Kegloy for his de?
cision. Nothing should bo done that;
would militate against a sale of bonds
and if thoro is any doubt about the
logality of passing on tho matter at
a special term of court, it should be
allowed to go over. Tho probability
is there will bo no bond issuo funds
in band before July 1st, if tho special
term is not called.
