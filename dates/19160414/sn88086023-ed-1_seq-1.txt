unanimously determined that there
would be no change In the Coiled

the withdrawal of troops will stand
unanswered. Wilson's attitude during
the meeting Is unknown. The cabinet
decided to gather all the facts before
attempting final action.
Carranza telegraphed a renewal of
the request for the withdrawal of
troopa. This was filed with the or

night was considered significant.
Stone went on record in favor of a
