THE SPIRIT OF 1860 MUST GUIDE
NATION, SAYS ROOSEVELT.
Theodore Roosevelt issued the following statement last night:
"0( course, I deeply appreciate what Tlie Tribune says of mc,
but I appreciate infinitely more what it says m advocacy of the
things for whi< h I stand.
"The f;nal sentence of the cditorial says. 'We are choosirg which
?vay the country shall go in thc era that i^ now opening, just as our
fathers chose thc nation's path in thc days of 1860.'
"This sentence should bc in the mind of every man who at
Chicago next June takes part in formulating thc platform and nam
ing thc candidate. Thc mcn at Chicago should act in the spirit of
thc mcn who stood bchind Abrabani Lincoln.
"From time to time it has rcccntly bccn announccd that thc
fight against Mr. Wilson is to bc waged only. or almost only, on
thc tariff. Such an appca! would bc an appeal to thc belly and not
to thc soul of thc Ameruan nation. By all means providc thc things
of thc body. but only on condition that wc trcat thc body as the
rcrvant of thc soul.
"I bclievc heartily in a protcctive tanff. Unless wc rcturn to a
protcctive tanO, preferahly administcrcd through a commission of
cxpcrts. wc shall faie widcsprcad econcmu disaster at thc end of
this war.
"But this is not the great tssuc on which thc fight is to bc made
if the highest service is to bc rcndcred the Amcrican pcoplc. Thc issue
is that thc Amcrican peoplr must lind its own soul. Natiotial honor
is a spiritual thing that cannot bc haggled ovcr in tcrms of dollars.
Wc must stand not only for Amcrica first. but for America first and
last and all the time. and without any secoml.
"Our loyaltv must bc to thc whole Unitcd States. Thc Kast
must stand for the safeguarding of thc Pacilic Coast against cvcry
foe. The West must stand for the safeguarding of thc Atlantii Coast
against cvcry foe. Kast and VVcst and North and Soutrt alike must
hold the life of every man and thc honor of every woman on the
most remotc ranch on thc Mexican border as a sacred trust to be
guarantecd by the might of our united nation.
"We can ^e true to mankind at Inrgc only if we are frue to our
selves If we are false to ourselves we shall bc false to every one
elsc. We have a lofty ideal to scrve, a great mission to accomplish
for the cause of frcedom and of genuine democracy and of justicc
and fair dcaling throughout thc world.
"If we are weak and slothful and absorbed in mere money get
ting and vapid cxcitcmcnt we can neithcr scrvc these causes nor any
othcrs. We must stand for national conscience, for national dis
cipline and for preparednes-s?military, social and industriai?in ordcr
to help the soul of this nation.
"Wc stand for peace, but only for the peace that comes as a
right to the just man armed. and hot for the peace which the coward
purchases by abject submission to wrong. The peace of cowardice
leads in the end to war, after a record of shame."

WILSON PRAYS FOR PEACE, BUT ASKS
IF THE PEOPLE ARE READY TO ACT
Washingtcn. April 1}.?President Wilson. speaking at a Jeffer
son Day banquet of Democratics rrom all parts of the country here
to-night, prayed that the Untted States would not be drawn into a
quarrel not of its own choosing, but asked if the people were ready
to go in where the interests of America were coincident with the
interests of humaniry. and have the courage to withdraw when the
interests of humanity had been conserved ?
I!e was interrupted by cheers and shouts of "Yes."
During hia address the Presidtnt had mentioned the Kuropean
war and the Mexican question withotit uitimating what were his
plans in either of the problems ionfronting the United States
He declared that in the present situation the responstbility was
with the Democratic party. because that party controls the go%ern
ment, and that "it is for us" to hold the balance even and not to
allow some malign influence to depress one side or the other.
The President declared that he was not interested in personal
atnbition. nor even enthusiastic over party success. but that he was
interested in seeing the load deprrssing humanity lifted
What the nation demands now, the President said. is service
essrntially non-partisan, not only in consideration of foreign aifairs,
but in domestic affairs as well.
