The Smartest of
Spring Styles
for the Purse-Prudent Woman
It's not an easy matter to assemble season after season, an"
individual line of smart coats and suits, but being fortunate
enough to carry the Bischof line, we again cordially invite
you to view our lovely offerings and have no hesitation in
saying that every style is one that will make instant appeal
to the woman who values style-distinction.
Even- coat and suit for.Spring is refreshing in its originality
and the line is so varied, it permits of a wide selection.
The same style genius which has ever characterized Bischof
Coats and Suits stands out effectively in the Spring models.
Every model is attractive. The fashionable Style Marts of
the Country and the best Looms of the Land have been
searched to produce smart styles for limited incomes.
The fabrics are entirely novel and embody that rare ex
clusiveness desired by smart women.
The styles are extremely '"chic" and clever-
The colors simply radiate Spring:
and
The Prices arc within reason.

On last Friday uight G. S. Grif
fin & Son's store was robbed
Entrance was gained at the back
door by boreing through the door
just above the night latch and
then slipping the bolt back. Sev
eral pairs of shoes were taken, a
number of flash lights, some
candy and other articles. Satur
day, Mulligan's bloodhounds were
brought here Irom Lexington,
and they did a great deal of track
ing but the goods could not be lo
cated Later Johu Poynter was
arrested and had his examining
trial Tuesday, and was held over
to the Grand Jury. It is the be
lief of several of the citizens that
there is a gang operating around
here, but to catch them is where
the trouble rests. This is the
second or. third time this store
lias been robbed in the last year
Something should be done to stop
it. Mrs. W. M. Pallas and son,
Raymond, are visitiug relatives
in Louisville. Mr. aud Mrs. J. T.
Omary and children have re
turned from a few days' visit with
relatives in Louisville. T.J.Pen
ningtonwas in Mt Vernon, Sun
day. Mrs. J. H. Browning, of
May wood, has returnod home
after a few days' visit with rela
tives here. G. S. Griffin, after a
two weeks tussel with measles, is
able to leave his room. J. W.
Stephenson and crew. J. L. Pike,
Wampus Devault and G.R Chap
pel spent the night at Salt Petter
Cave. They all repoit'a verv
pleasant night. A man by the
name of Ward, of Knoxville, gave
five lectures here and we will say
if there were a few such men
scattered over the world satan
would have to go out ofJiusiness
and purgatory would be to rent
in less than a year. Miss Ella Mae
Blanford has returned from Louis
ville, where she has been visiting
relatives Atty. Ed Gentry, of
Mt. Vernon, was here Tuesday
in the Griffin and Foynter suit.
Mr. and Mrs. Fred Baker, of Mt.

Sheriff Cam Mullins, of Mt. Ver
nou, was in our town Tuesday on

don's wideawake salesman, was
here Tuesday shaking hands with
our merchants. The Knoxville
Booster Special passed through
here Tuesday and made a- fifteen
minute stop, shaking hands with
our citizens and receiving a hearty
welcome to our town. Mr. aud
Mrs W. H. Cottongim were called
to Pine Hill on account of the ill
ness of Mr. Cottongim's sister.
One thing we noticed during
the lectures, was that Baptist,
Jhristians and Presbyterians all
met at the same house of worship,
and all took an active part. This
is something all should be proud
of for Christ says, "I am the
vine and ye are the branches,"
and besides we are all striving for
the same heaven. We can't see
why we can't do this all the
ime, members of one church visit
the other churches. The differ
ence in the churches are not
enough to keep us apait and if
we have any prejudice lets lay-it
aside and go to hear all and prove
that which is good. The Walton
Brothers, of Glasgow, Ky., sold
several town lots here Tuesday
on the Livingston heights. We
learn that they went like hot
cakes We would be glad to see
a few items from the pen of .our
old friend James Maret. What
has become of him? We don't be
lieve that he has gone to Mexico
chasing Villa, perhaps he is
some where making Boone Way
speeches. But lei that be as it
may, we want to hear from him,
if only a line Wade Graces, of
Mt .Vernon, the telephone man,
was in our town Monday.
Mr. and Mrs. John Cress, of
Preachersville section, were the

ing, haviug moved to the E L.
Brown property on Maple Ave.
Tht grizzly bear story told by the
Livingston letter writer last
week, and applied to us, in our
judgement the jokewillbe revers
ed by the votes of the great com
mon people next November, ana
it might appear that his smiles
now are more enjoyed thau they
will be after the fight is over.

unpreparedness. See this picture.
INSOMNIA
Indigestion nearly always dis
turhs the sleep more or less, and
is often the cause of insomnia.
Eat a light supper with little if
any meat, and no milk; also take
one of Chamberlain's Tablets im
mediately after supper, and see if
you d( not rest much better. Ob
tainable everywhere.
IN-
WHY CONSTIPATION
JURES
The bowels-are the natural sew
erage system of the qody. When
they become.obstructed by con
stipation a part of the poisonous
matter which they should carry
off is absorbed into the svstem
making you feel dull and stupid,
and interfering with the digestion
and assimilation of food. This
condition ,s quickly- relieved by
Chamberlain's Tablets. Obtaina
ble everywhere.
VVT E have a post office here only
'6 days old. It was secured
by the efforts of W.J. Brown, who
is the post master. Mr. Brown
came to Level Green 28 ears ag'
as a rank stranger, and we took
him in, and he has always since
that time proven himself worthy
of our confidence arid respect.
After graduating in the common
schools o( Rockcastle county, he
was married to Miss Julia Cum
mins and to this union have Jbeen
born two promising children,
Vernon and Coreua. Mr. Brown
is a genial gentleman and is well
known in this and surrounding
counties, having operated roller
mills at Science Hill, Crab Orch
ard, Brodhead and other poins.
Last September he bought the
farm, store and undertaking es
tablishment of Mr. P. Q. Griffin
and now carries a 5,000 stock of
jeneial rnerehandise and under
takers supplies. We have daily
mail here which no'doubt accom
jnQdates -more people' than any
other country post office in the
county. 'The new. office and his
big store are the talk-of the com
munity. May his success contin

In Mt Vernon
The Knoxille boosters arrived
Tuesday on schedule time and Mt.
Vernonwas out in full force and
effect to give them a hearty wel
come. They were a jolly and fine
looking bunch and their short visit
to Mt. Vernon made for them
many new friends in Rockcastle's
capitol and we trust made lor us
friends among Knoxyillians. On
every side of Main street and in
the show windows of every busi
ness house, swung welcome ban
ners and the good old true Ken
tucky style, in which the Boosters
were received, was conceeded by
avery one of the one hundred
boosters to be one of the most cor
dial welcomes accorded them on
cheir entire trip. Both the Lang
ion Memorial and Graded schools
dismissed for the occasion, and
joined in a body, in the march.
First the primary and first grade
rooms of the Graded school sang
x welcome song, followed by
Atty. J. W. Brown, who in a few
mt well chosen words welcomed
the Boosters to our city, pointing
jut to them the gate, the ingen
ious production of James Pinker
on, ot the Signal force, which
stood ajar and told them that ev
ery thing within was theirs and to
ase it as they liked. Judge H. B.
Undsay, Captain ot the Booster
speakers, said a few words and
then presented Mr. C C. Gilbert,
jf the Advisory Committee, who
-esponded to the welcome address
The stay was so short that many
-.lungs were lelt off, but as
Judge Lindsay arose he saw the
large banner suspended across
vlain street from Fish & Son's
corner to U G. Baker's corner,
.vith the inscription, "Welcome to
aur City, Knoxville," he said that
avery Knoxville Booster must
oass under that banner before
leaving Headed by the Univer
sity ol Tennessee Band, twenty
ave iu number, the march smarted,
md it was here the moving pict
ure man did his best although he
nad been busy from the time he
anded in Mt. Vernon. These
jictures will be shown at the
Boone Way opera house within
the next few weeks. With the
Kentucky School song by the srirls
)l Langdon School, the time had
irrived to depart and the Boost
ers were soon aboard their special
speeding on to Barbourville,
vhero the next stop was to be
nade. Knoxville represents ev
ery industry andin some lines she
i.s right up in fubt rank with the
nuch larger ci'ies and one beau.
y about that city, there is no go
Dack but their motto is get better
ill the time. This is the first of
.vhat is to be an annual event
.vith Knoxville's progressive busi
nes men, and whenever they
urn their course towrd Mt.

There is more Catarrh in this

other diseases put together, and
for years it was supposed to be
incurable. Doctors prescribed
local remedies, and by constantly
failing to cure by local treatment,
pronounced it incurable. Catarrh
is a local disease, greatly influenc
ed by constitutional conditions
and therefore requires constitu
tional treatment. Hall s Catarrh
Cure manufactured by F. J. Chen
