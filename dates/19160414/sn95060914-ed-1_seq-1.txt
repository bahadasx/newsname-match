SEVENTH CAVALRY IN BATTLE
With Villistas at Parral Chihua
hua One American Re
ported Killed
A dispatch from Washington
dated April 13jth states that the
American troops in Mexico had
their first battle with the natives
at the moment General Carranza
was urging their withdrawal
Wednesday night when Car
ranzas note requesting the with
drawal of the American forces
was en route to Washington
troopers of the 7th cavalry un
der Major Tompkins were fired
on in Parral a Villa stronghold
in western Chihuahua and were
pursued to the suburbs The
Carranza garrison took a doubt
ful part in the affray They
were attacked during the night
Complete information of the
incident has not reached Wash
ington but Secretary Baker said
that according to unofficial re
ports an American cavalryman
was killed and the troopers used
a machine gun against the Mexi
cans
Baker ordered General Funston
to take any steps necessary to
prevent any further trouble and
when asked whether this will
mean the enforced use of the
railroads for the movement of
soldiers and supplies Baker said
that Funston being on theground
would act in any emergency I
Carranza pointed out that the
clash proved wis contention that
the presence of the Americans in
Mexico is leading the situation to
a point which threatens to get
beyond his contiol and tele
graphed that many deaths had
occurred on both sides
The subject of the attack and
Carranzas withdrawal of his pro
posal will be considered at a
cabinet meeting today Members
of the official family however
indicated that it is practically
certain that no immediate order
for the withdrawal of the troops
will be issued
The situation of Major Tomp
kins detachment is causing much
anxiety as he is outnumbered in
a notoriously anti American dis
trict possibly beleaguered in am
bush and his troops may be in
grave danger
