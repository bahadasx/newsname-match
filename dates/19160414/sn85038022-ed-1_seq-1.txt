Mnjsilllo Needs Almost $100 More Ic
fore Team Is Assured Chilli
cothc WlllliiK To Tnko
(her Franchise.
Up to tho present tlmo only n llttlo
over $600 has been rnlscd by tho com
mittee which wns out to secure tho $1,
000 gunrantco nnd n working fund of
$500, in nil $1,500. Tho nmount Hum
fnr secured Is not enough to start tho
reason nnd unless tho nmount Is se
cured tho franchise will bo sold to
Chllllcotho nnd Mnysvllle will drop
out of the league.
There Is no ronson why tho fans of
Mnysvlllo should not rnlso tho neces
sary nmount. The people of Maysvlllc
want baseball, but tho question Is, do
they wnnt It bnd enough to ralso tho
money?
Mnnnger Jones says lie has n good
bunch of players ready to report any
time thnt the Maysvlllc management
Is rendy. Ho Is very enthusiastic
about tho team nnd says ho would
much rather come to Mnysvllle thnn
go to Chllllcotho.
"Muck" McOrnynor wns traded
Wednesdny to tho Toledo tenm of the
American Association for two good
right-hand pitchers. Tills was done
becnuso of tho fact thot McOrnynor
would not come to Mnysvlllo unless
given nn exorbitant salary and tho
management did not feel that It would
he in a position to pay It.
Pitcher French writes that he has
been on the farm all winter nnd that
he Is willing to report at any time. In
closing ho says: "I certainly do love
thnt dear old Mnysvllle."
Outfielder Tinnln Is hero now ready
for training and said that ho expect
ed to see tho rest of tho boys already
on the job when ho nrrlved.
The outlook for n good season is
bright, but the team can not bo run
without capital. It's up to you, Mr.

Ono of the best quartets of malo
singers over before a Maysvllle audi
ence was the Metropolitan Grand
Quartet at the High School auditorium
Thursday cveuing. Individually and
collectively the singing was up to the
highest standard.
Tho personnel was notable In having
tho following: Mr. Charles L. N'cth,
lyric tenor; Mr. Paul Chase, robust
tenor; Mr. John Eberly. baritone; Mr
Thomas Wade Lane, basso, and Mrs.
Willo Pago Lane, pianist. Mr. N'eth
led tho others both in range of voice
and power. There was a ring to his
tono that sounded llko the chimes of
a bell most sensitively tuned to music
of tho spheres, as it were. Mr. Lane
was very pleasing and the deep, rich,
mellifluous tones of the profundo were
delightful to listen to. Tho singing
of Mr. ChaBc was very effective, espec
ially his solo work. Mr. Eberly has
a sweet, oven voice, vcll regulated
and very flexible, and is especially
good ns n soloist.
Tho ensemble work of tho quartet
was very commendable; tho voices
blended In perfect harmony, nnd the
quartet was well balanced. The quar
tet numbers on tho program proved
very popular and wero well fitted to
bring out tho best effects of tho voices
collectively. Tho program was of a
semi-popular nature and wns woll re
ceived. Especially pleasing wero the
two closing numbers, the first net of
"Faust," and the "Sextctto from Lu
cia." All in all, tho number was most ex
cellent and Mnysvlllo Is enthusiastic
In its praise.
