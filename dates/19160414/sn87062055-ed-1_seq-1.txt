MEN'S MATED CLUB
Governor Hunt addressed the Wens'
Club of the Federated church last
Friday evening, his theme being "Pri
son Reform." Dr Hambly introduced
the governor to the. audience, a well
filled house, many of whom were in
sympathy with his well known prison
policy. The governor presented his
side of the case and took occasion to
say that the newspapers had not told
the straight of his methods and had
given him the worst of it at every
opportunity.
In the evening the Elks, of which
body the governor is a member, gave
him a banquet at the Commercial
hotel. There were about fifty Elks
present with a bountiful supply of
good things provided for all. M. A.

there was a movement toward homed

Paper Now Soaring High
If you need any job printing, get it
now. No one knows where the end
of the present prices on paper is go
ing. No prices are available. We
have endeavored to protect our pa
trons by as big a supply of paper as
we could carry. A number of paper
orders have been turned down by
paper houses on orders sent in at last
quotations. From 25 to 50 per cent
has been added to prices within the
past few weeks and right or wrong, it
is up to us to pay it or go without
paper. The end is not yet anywhere
in sight and an order placed now may
save considerable money.
WORK OF THE SURGICAL
DRESSING COMMITTEE
The Surgical Dressing Committee,
which is a National Committee of the
Woman's Department of the National
Civic Federation, was organized in
October, 1914, for the purpose of sup
plying small emergency hospitals in
Europe with sterilized surgical dress
ings in a convenient form for imme
diate use. During the first twelve
months of its activities over 3,000,000
surgical dressings were shipped to
various hospitals in the war zone for
free distribution. This is of course
only a drop in the bucket, and the
appeal for supplies for the suffering
men at the front becomes more despe
rate each month. The relief work
was early organized in the east and
now the western part of the country
is beginning to respond to this great
need. Arizona had lately organized,
with Mrs. Gordon Tweed of Phoenix,
as state chairman, and the good work
is well under way.
The Committee will meet both
morning and afternoon next week,
from 10 until 12 and from 2 until 5,
on Wednesday in the children's room
of the library. All who are willing
to assist us are most welcome.
Materials are greatly needed, linn
and cotton, no matter how old and
worn, old bedspreads and Turkish
towels, or new gauze, muslin, absorb
ent cotton, etc. We hope for a gene
rous response to our appeal for work
ers and material.
Mrs Hugh Anderson and three
boys, of Willard, N. M., .arrived in
Flagstaff the first of the week and
will remain a couple months with
Mr. and Mrs. W. H. Anderson.
L
BOTH IN
The first Inter-Normal debate be
tween the Normal schools of Flagstaff
and Tempe was held Friday, April 7,
1916. The subject of the debate was:
"Resolved that the United States
should increase its merchant marine
by purchase, national ownership and
construction." Flagstaff's affirmative j
team debated with the negative team
from Temne in the Emerson hall be
fore a large and attentive audience,
and heat them two to one. Those de
fending the question were Miss Elsie
Jordan, Mr. Hubert Coulson and Mr.
William Beaton, while those denying
it were Mr. Page, Mr. Steele and Mr.
Maier.
The Hphntn wna ntrrtit In, Pav T?
W. Boone, C. P. Silvernail, attorney,
of Williams and the Rev. J. M. White
of Winslow. '
The speakers were most interesting
and kept the audience sittimr un
straight all of the time.
Because this was a real live Ques
tion with lots of room for argument
and because each of the debaters was
so well prepared to handle his subject
cacrfully, it seemed very hard to
foresee the decision of the judges.

In Temne the nuestion was affirmed i

COMMISSION WILL RENDER'
PHONE DECISION LATFR
A hearing on the telephone rates
in Flagstaff was held by the State
Corporation Commission at the Court
house Tuesday. Chairman F. AJones
presided and Member A. W. Cole was
present with William Neil Sangster,
auditor and Stenographer Philliposki
to assist then in the hearing. Assi
stant Attorney-General Lester Hardy
and City Attorney Hemperley, repre
sented the city's side of the case. At
torney H. M. Fennemore of Phoenix
represented the telephone company;
Dean Clark, of El Paso and Harry
McVey were present in the interest
of thecompany.
An exhaustive compilation of fig
ures were gone over by Auditor Sang
ster, showing the profit claimed with
in the state of Arizona as well as the
total cost and profits for the entire
system. It was shown by this report
that the company was making but a
fraction over three per cent on the
money invested.
The physical value of the local
telephone system was shown by Assi
stant State Engineer Ben Ferguson,
who made an investigation of it some
months previous.
No verdict was rendered by the
commission, but it was stated by them
that no briefs would be required. The
commission concluded its hearing
during the afternoon and left in the
evening for a similar hearing to be
held Wednesday in Prcscott.
The thing that seems most peculiar
to phone users is that the rates for
phones at Williams are lower than
they arc here, and the claim is made
that the company is -not paying a
reasonable profit here.
The commission did not announce
when a decision in the case would b
given out.

TEMPE AND FLAGSTAFF
were Mr. Prather, Mr. Smith and Miss
Lee of the Flagstaff school. The de
cision given was in favor of the
negative four to one.
Flagstaff's success in both of these
debates was due first: to the hearty
cooperation .between those on the
teams and the members of the faculty
who were backing them; second, to
the amount of good authority and up-to-date
material which our debaters
had; third, to the generous and en
thusiastic support given to the de
baters by the student body and the
citizens of Flagstaff, and last of all
to the spledid help given by members
of the faculty Those who specially
aided in preparing this debate arc
Mr. Lathrop the coach, Mr. Thorpe,
who trained the debaters for delivery.
Mr. Walker, who criticised material
and Mr. Rosenberry, who prepared
charts. With so much to help us is it
any wonder that we came off victo
riously? Do Flagstaff people realize what
winning this debate means to us ? As
one person in commenting upon the
debate said, "This has helped to put
Flagstaff on the map more than any
other event of the school year. The
people in the Salt River valley have
had the idea that it is the center of
the universe; they will now began to
realize that Flagstaff is at least in
the same state."
This year's success has encouraged
the Northern Arizona Normal school
and has aroused their determination
to win the debates of future years.
NORMAL BALL TEAM WINS
FIRST HKFRM WINSLOW
It seems that the Normal school is
daily gaining a reputation, which is
placing Flagstaff on the map as a
"College Town." Inspired by the
schools glorious victory in debating
the baseball team left Saturday for
(Winslow to play the first game of
the season with the Winslow High
School boys, and to "bring home the
bacon." Although the score might
'remind us of a merry-go-round, the
crowd, nevertheless, were on their
toes every minute.
Winslow took the field with Parks
and Arzilla as battery and sent the
"lumberjacks" to the bushes in short
order. Beaton and Pulliam then went
in as .battery for Flagstaff and not
much time had passed until a "car
wackcr" crossed the plate. This sent
the fans fairly inta the air but both
sides came to themselves and played
a clean shut-out game for a few in
nings. The lumberjacks finally found the
"car-whacker" pitcher's number and
the baloon went up, for at the fifth
inning, the former team was in the
lead by a score of 15 to 1. The high
school boys did not quit, however, but
rallied and showed real team work in
the following three innings by shut
ting the Normalites out while they
were piling up an ultimate score of
ten for themselves.
With everything going in their
direction at the start of the ninth in
ning, the Winslow fans did not have
room for their feet in the grandstand,
so they moved out on the side lines
to satisfy their emotions by exercis
ing their enthusiasm. This did not
bother the boys, however, and the in
ning ended in a shut out for both
sides with a final score of 10 to 15.
With the showing of the latter part
of this game, considering that it was
the firs$ game of the season, it is very
likely that the people of Flagstaff will
have an opportunity to witness a fast
game on the home grounds, Saturday
afternoon, April 22, between the Nor
mal and Winslow. The game will be
called at 2:30.
M. A. Murphy for City Clerk
The last one to throw his hat in the
ring for the office of City Clerk at the
coming election on May 22nd, is M. A.
Murphy, the well known real estate
and insurance man. Mr Murphy has
good business ability and is in every
way equipped for the rapidly increas
ing duties of that office. The city is
growing rapidly and of necessity
handles a vast amount of business
each year which requires one of ex
ceptional ability to properly, handle.
Mr. Murphy is well known to the
people of Flagstaff and has been in
business here for a number of years;
his friends are many and they propose
to give him strenuous support for
the place.
Mr. Murphy's slogan is: "A bigger,
better and more progressive Flagstaff."
NEW OIL FIELD FOUND
NORTH OF MLORIDO RIVER
Interest in the oil wells has again
struck this section of the country and
considerable excitement has been
stirred up over the .discovery of
crude oil on the north side of the
Colorado river near Lee's Ferry. Oil
was discovered floating down a creek
a mile from the source where it
seeped out of the ground. It seems
to be of asphalt base and burns read
ily; The discovery was made about
a month ago by a man named Lee
who brought samples to Flagstaff. A
company was organized composed of
S. S. Acker, George Babbitt, W. G.
Dickinson and Lee. An engineer and
surveyor was sent over there to make
locations and further investigate the
find. If their report is favorable,
work of sinking wells will be com
menced this summer on the property.
Experts have long claimed that
there was oil in paying quantities in
that section of the country but no
company has so far attempted to
develope it
A few good oil wells in this section
would materially advance the pros
perity of Flagstaff.
FLAGSTAFF HU H'VE
ANOTHERMOVIE SHOW
Flagstaff will soon have another
moving picture show house on San
Francisco street, making the third
new house now under consideration.
The new show house will be under the
management of Henry Carr, a recent
arrival from El Paso, Texas, who
recently sold out his business in that
city. Mr. Carr has secured a ten year
lease of Mrs. Julius Herman for a
new building to be built next to the
old Curio saloon building. The build
ing will be 50x100 feet, one half to
he used for the new show house and
the balance as a store building for the
Herman Dry Goods Co. Mr. Carr
advises that the new building will be
of brick and stone, marble front and
the show portion of the house will
have a fifteen foot lobby, with a illu
minated front. The foundations will
be laid for a two story building, but
will only be put up one story for the
present.
The interior of the new theatre will
be fitted up with opera chairs and be
up to date in every particular, Mr.
Carr claims.
Dr. E. E. Oldaker Resigns Position
Dr. E. E. Oldaker has resigned his
position with the government as in
spector in charge of Arizona Bureau
of Animal Industry, and will go into
the sheep business for himself. Dr,
Oldaker has been on the job in Ari
zona for several years and was well
liked by the stockmen with whom he
had dealings in his official capacity.
Dr. Bert Haskett has been appoint
ed inspector in charge of the Arizona
district and will assume the duties of
chief commencing May 1st. Dr. Has
kett is an old timer in the service and
one of the best posted men in the
business.
His appointment will please the
sheepmen who are now offering him
congratulations on his deserved pro
motion. Patriotic Week
Editor F. S. Breen, of the Coconino
Sun at Flagstaff, lately suggested and
the suggestion has been acted upon
enthusiastically .by the citizens of
Flagstaff, for the observance of a
period to be called "Patriotic Week,"
beginning Sunday, May 28, when there
will be patriotic celebrations in the
churches, patriotic sermons and pa
triotic songs. During the week there
will be patriotic picnics and balls end
patriotic films will be shown in all the
moving picture houses.
The second day will be "Clean-Up-Day,"
when local patriotism will be
expressed in the making of the town
presentable. The events of the week
naturally cluster about Memorial Day.
The object of Mr. Breen was to
turn the thoughts of citizens toward
an investigation of the country's con
ditions as they exist and not as we
have merely taken it for granted that
they exist. As Mr. Breen says:
"There should be a day when the real
inside truth of our national condition
should be told the people straight
from the shoulder That will be more
beneficial than parades and fire
works." If "Patriotic Week" were generally
observed throughout the country the
advocates of national preparedness
would have an easier task than has
been set for them. Phoenix Republican.
VERY BUSY WEEK IN THE
LOCANUSTICE COURT
In the justice court last week, Judge
Harrington says, it was just one thing
after another, most of the time.
One of the peculiar cases was that
of Jennie Heard, who has been running
the Ideal rooming house. She had a
roomer by the name of Henry Bash
got arrested for the nonpayment of a
bill. Bashgot was haled into court
on the charge and it was discovered
by the testimony of Mrs. Heard that
tho amount due was for whiskey sold
the defendant She was subsequently
arrested on charge of selling booze,
but for the want of sufficient evidence
was turned lose. Bashgot, he got;
Heard had gone and Mrs. Heard had
to listen. The total result was a
waterhaul.
James McCann, who was accused of
being mayor of the south side and
having been mixed with a booze sell
ing game, was acquitted for the lack
of evidence.
Fay Dalton and Dean Darling, who
are residents of the redlight district,
were released and their cash bonds
returned to them, because of insuffi
cient evidence. The main witnesses
in the cases having shaken the accu
mulation of local peat from their
feet.
Charles Willis, who was arrested at
Kingman on the complaint of J. W.
Francis for having obtained approxi
mately the sum of $6.00 from him
under the pretense of going to work
for him, demanded a jury trial and
was convicted on the charge against
him. A, long and short man a blond and
a brunette, were up last Saturday for
having gathered junk, such as brass
and copper wire too closely to the
domain of people who had previously
understood that they owned the stuff.
The junk was recovered and as there
was a lack of purpose to continue the
march in legal procedure, Judge Har
rington very magnanimously granted
them twenty minutes solar time to
gather distance. They very promptly
agreed to the change of climate.
New Bridge for Jack's Canyon
County Engineer W. H. Power and
Assistant Berg left Monday for Jack's
Canyon at a point seventeen miles
south of Winslow to commence the
construction of a new steel bridge for
the county on the National Highway.
Assistant Berg will have charge of
the work of construction.
"An Alien" at the Empress Theatre
Sunday Matinee and Night
"An Alien" is an amplified version
of the remarkably successful playlet,
"The Sign of the Rose," which for five
years served Mr. George Beban as a
starring vehicle both in this country
and abroad.
In order to fittingly celebrate an
expected inheritance from his late
father, Phil Griswold, a worthless
young roue, persuades his friend
Robbins to steal from his employer,
a fashionable florist, the funds neces
sary to make the revelry even greater.
To his chagrin Phil learns the next
day that he has been'cut off with one
dollar, and thus the two young men
are placed in a position from which
they realize it will be difficult to ex
tricate themselves. ,
On a visit to the home of his
brother, William Griswold, Phil no
tices his nieces fear of an Italian
ditch-digger, who has come bringing
a Christmas tree. He determines to
kidnap Dorothy, and manages to di
rect suspicion toward Pedro (Mr. Be
ban). Searching the Italian quarter for
the Alien in his automobile, William
runs over Pietro's little daughter Ro
sina and kills her. Pietro wanders to
the flower-shop at which Robbins is
emplayed, and entering to buy a rose
for the little girl's grave he is seized
by detectives, who think him the
writer of the mysterious note which
told their client to know the kidnap
per by the Sign of the Rose.
Mr. Rudolp Kuchler, president of
the Farmers' Union and also presi
dent of the Taxpayers' Association of
the state, was in Flagstaff from
Phoenix Tuesday on a business trip.
Mr. Kuchler was a member of the
state legislature of Utah for twelve
years and is now one of the strongest
thinkers of the thickly populated sec
tion in the middle of the state.
Mr. T. J. Fitzmorris, section fore
man at Cliffs, was called to Elko,
Nevada, Monday night by a telegram
advising him that his youngest broth
er was not expected to live.
