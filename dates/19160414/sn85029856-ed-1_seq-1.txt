Lindsey Wright baa sold his Inter
est in the Annex Cafe to his brother.
Cary Wright, and is figuring on leav
ing Liberal about May 1. He will go
to Northwestern Colorado and the
state of Ttah where he"has a brother
whom he hasn't seen for over thirty
years and whose exact whereabouts
are unknown to him at present. How
ever, he figures on running across
him in a short time after getting up
there and will spend a month or two
with him. Lindsey may also invest
in some land in that part of the
world before returning. The Wright
brothers have owned the Annex for a
number of years, and Lindsey has
been In Liberal so long that the old
est inhabitant doesn't remember any
more just when he first arrived, so
his leaving town will remove a fa
miliar figure from the scenes of its
activity. Cary Wright, who now owns
the restaurant, is an experienced man
at the business and will no doubt en
joy aa good a trade and give aa good
service aa that famous "beanery" has
always done. .

today, and ought to pull the load of

purchasing of additional equipment
