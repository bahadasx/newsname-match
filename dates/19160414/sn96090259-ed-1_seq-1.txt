SIERRA MOJADA IS SACKED
VIllA BAND NUMBERING IOOO
MAKES ATTACK ON TOWN. BE
STATING AMERICAN PROPERTY
Washington, April 11—The farther
inorease of the United States forces in
Mexioo is reoiving prominent offloial
consideration. Confidential advices
to Gen. Fanston, it is understood, re
fer to the qaestion of a line of com*
mnnioation.
The oonoern of army officials on the
border regarding the movement of the
Oar ran za troops toward Oasas Grandes
is refleoted to some extent in offloial
quarters here.
The persistent report that the ase of
the National Gaard is contemplated
drew a statement from high authority
that the president is not considering
•ooh a step. The report of Villa's
death is regarded as a hoax.
.. El Paso, April 14—A Villa band,
numbering perhaps 1,000, sacked Sierra
Mojada, eighty miles south of Jimintz,
destroying muoh American property
according to information reoeived by
the representative of an American
mining oonoern.
San Antonio, April 14.—Fuither de
lay in providing Gen. Pershing with
more men for operations agaiast Villa,
who is now believed to have effaoted a
junoture of his foroes at Durango,
appeared certain,
Whether the somswhat vague un
derstanding between the Amerioan of
Boers and the Carranzi authorities for
the movement of supplies consigned
as ordinary freight is a sucoess is con*
sidered doubtful in some quarters.
SEE NOTABLES IN WAR FILMS
View of Kaiser and Austrian Generals in Ac
tion in "Germany on the Firing Line"
When "Germany on the Firing Line''
is presented for the first time in Hot
Springs at the Morris Grand theatre
on next Monday evening, our people
will have their first opportunity to see
the offloial German motion pictures
taken by enliBted photographers under
the direction of the general staff fo
the government arohives.
Think for a moment what this
means. These piotures, 6*000 feet of
film, are a selected part of the ones
which Germany will preserve as gov
erment war records. They are in re
ality an offloial piotorial history of
many of the prinoipal events of the
year preceding the capture of Warsaw
This means that you will have an
opportunity to see the war as the Kai
ser and his generals 6aw it up to that
time. The piotures tell the "inside"
story of the war from Germany's point
of view.
You will see the Kaiser olose to the
front, and the empresp. You will see
the great generals who are making his
tory—von Rindenburg, von Maoken
seo, von der GoUz, von Buelow, and
others almost as famous. And you
will see therm ''in action" so to speak
doing something or going somewhere,
not just posing for the oamera,
Enlisted men took the pictures.
AuBtrians in this country will be inter
•sted in the piotures of the Emperor
Franois Joseph which show the mon
arch with his generals and troops.
The king of Bavaria, the sultan of Tur
key and the suooessor to the Turkish
throne are also shown—all a part of
the offloial reoord of the German side
of the war as depicted in "Germany on
the Firing Line." Shown at the Mor
ris Grand Theatre on Monday and
Tuesday, April 17th and 18th, matinee
and night. Admission 25 cents to all.
COMMISSION MEN HERE

Here Monda and Tuesday
The Sioax City and South Omaha
live ntook interests visited this city on
Monday and Tuesday of this week at
whioh time the Twenty-Fifth Annual
Stook Growers Association Meeting
was
in session heie. The Sioux City
contingent arrived on Monday morn
ing and were net at the train by the
Hot SpringH Firemen's baud and a
large delegation of Stoox Indians from
the Pine Ridge in their paint and eighth grade, Orpha Ball
feathers. The Omaha crowd of stock
and commission men arrived that
evening from Belle Fourohe where
they had spent the day meeting stock
men and others at that plaoe. Two
speoial pullman sleeping oars were
used to transport the parties.
The purpose of these trips eaoh year
is to avail themselves of the opportun
ity of meeting their many old time
friends and customers nearer their
homes, and with the extended territory
which will be covered this spring,
everyone interested from these two
markets feel that the 191G trip will be
one of the most suooessfai from every
point of view.
Upon their departure from the city
Tuesday evening it was the universal
expression of the commission men that
the Hot Springs meeting was the best
held for several seasons and everyone
thoroughly enjoyed the two days.
From this city they went to Ohadron
and thence west to Thermopolis, Wy
oming to attend the Wyoming Stock
Growers Meeting and from there they
will go to Miles City, Montana.
The Sioux City contingent will then
go over the Northern Paoiflo to St.
Paul and from there home and the
South Omaha crowd will go from Miles
City to Cheyenne aud Denver and then
home.

REPEAL OF
SUGAR
SUBSTITUTE FOR THE HOUSE
RESOLUTION IS PASSED
IT IS NOT YET A LAW
CONTROVERSY EXPECTED WHEN THE
MEASURE COMES UP AGAIN FOR
FINAL ACTION BY BOTH
Washington, April 14.—The senate
has passed the substitute for the house
free sugar repeal resolution, extending
the duty of one oent a pound until
May, 1920. The vote was 40 to 3*2. Four
democrats—Broussard, Ransdell, New
lands and Lane—joined with the re
publicans in voting against the sub
stitute. They favor a fiat repeal. A
sharp controversy between the house
and senate is predicted. Unless a con
ference agreement is reached and ap
proved before May 1, sugar goes on the
free list.
Most of the tariff discussion did not
touch the sugar issue, but was devoted
to Works' amendment to inorease the
tariff on lemons and other citrus fruit
to one oent a pound. This was defeat
ed by a vote of 44 to 29. Phelan said
that seven California counties com
prised the lemon produoing region of
the United States and that the reduct
ion of duty had caused a loss of $800,
000 in the revenue, lie insisted that
lemons were a luxury and not a neces
sity.
Vandaman declared he would not
vote to tax the necessities of life or for
battleships not needed.
The senate will resume the debate on
the army re-organization bill tomorrow
on whioh it votes by agreement on
Tuesday.
RACE EVENTS
The Two Days Program a Hummer Here at
Stock Meeting
In writing up the Western South Da
kota Stook Growers Association Btook
meeting held in this city Monday and
Tuesday of this week speoial mention
should be made of the program for the
entertainment of the crowd. On Mon
day morning the Hot Springs Band,
whioh furnished such good music for
the two days, met the trains to welcome
the visitors and as an added attraction
the Sioux Indians to the number of
a oouple of hundred were on the
streets in the patut and feathers. Fol
lowing the arrival of the trains the re
mainder of the forenoon was taken up
by the visitors in getting looated.
In the afternoon a raoe program was
pulled off on the new race track on
College Hill composed of bicycle
raoe, oowboy raoes, Indian races, fquaw
teepee race, whioh by the way was one
sorrow^
tail
1-'. i—
"HE SHOULD WORRY."
?0^7
of the most mirth provoking of the
entire list, tmoklng contest and auto
mobile race. Eaoh event was hotly
contested mid the crowd was more than
satisfied with the afternoon. At 4:30
p. m. a swimming contest was held at
the Evans plunge.
On Tuesday morning the band and
the Indians were again at the trains
and immediately following their arrival
a fine parade was pulled off. Head
ed by the and the line of march was
from lower town up River Avenue to
Gibson'sooroer and theu back. Sjme
new and "novel floats were in the pa
rade. The Bingham-Williams Implc
ment Co ,, oum# first with their big
traotor hauling rii implement display
that was Hue. The Cold Brook Dairy,
George Call proprietor, had a large
float aotually demonstrating their milk
ing maohine with two dairy oows used
in the demonstration. Hugh Houghton
of Lithla. bad a sheep shearing fljat
with gas engine and dippers going full
blast. Hesnard and F. M. Stew
art had some of the finest Peroheon
horses in the parade to be seen any
where. The Keystone Lifery was also
represented and last but not least oame
the Iudians and town people in autos.
Tuesday nfterncon another fine pro
gram of racjs and Bports pleased the
crowd. First oame the base ball game
between the looal high school and the
Chadron Normal whioh was won by
the local boys before a crowd that
filled the park by a score of 10 to 3.
The raoes oame next and they were
equally as good as the first day.
As the Commission men and stook
men stated upon leaving here Tuesday
evening, this meeting was one of the
best held in the past ten years.
A great deal of oredit is due to some
of the enterprising business men of
the oity for their work of building the
excellent traok on College Hill. In the
first plaoe the traok was built in about
four days and Harry Bailey, L. A.
Daniel, Lyman Allen and Bert Bow
man should reoeive speoial oredit for
their work of starting and overseeing
the work of construction. The gentle
men named made the traok possible.
To begin with they secured S. A. Cal
houn to survey the track and he do
nated his services, Naxt oame Bing
ham & William", who plowed and grad
ed the traok with their big traotor and
they also donated a part of their ser
vices. Teams were then necessary for
the leveling and hauling of material
and the following gentlemen donated
their services together with their teams
and the work was done: Elvin Aaburg,
George Cull, William Mulford, Roth
Transfer Company, Hot Springs Trans
fer Company. Keystoue Livery, Paul
Rioher and John Evans besides a num
ber of men without teams donated a
day or more to the work.
Now that the stook meeting is over
this traok should be made a permanent
proposition and it oau be made to be
one of the big attractions here during
the year. We should have a raoe meet
here a little later and we would sug
gest that a company be organized to
take over this work or that some com
mercial organization get behind the
movement.

STOCK MEETING
A SUCCESS
BIG CROWD HERE FOR
DAYS MEETING
TWO
THE BEST IN YEARS
OMAHA AND SIOUX CITY COMMISSION
MEN AND ASSOCIATION MEMBERS
HERE IN FORCE
The 125th annual meeting of the West
ern South Dakota Stook Growers Asso
ciation was held here on Monday aud
Tuesday of this week. What a privi
lege to the rising generation and par
ticularly those raised in eastern states
to meet and touoh hands with these
sturdy and sterling but fast disappear
ing characters who pioneered this por
tion of the middle west, made railroads
and oivilation possible and are to day
the same free, loyal and patrio'. io cit
izens as of yore. While many of the
following have been honored in state
and national affairs they retain their in
dividuality and are knowu to their
friends as Jimmy Craig, Charlie Coffee,
Charlie Ham, Ike Humphrey, E1
Stenger, Shorty West, Harry Brindley,
Tom Jones, Billy Borst, Ben Ash, Jaok
Hale, Hank Simmons, ]ohn Hart, Jaok
Daley, Frank Stewart, John Brennan,
Diok Stirks and many others whose
names we cannot just now reoall. Ad
vanced civilization and oustomes, the
accumulation of hard earned fortunes
nor the grey hairs caused bv hardships
and exposure cannot ohange the sunny
disposition and genuine frendship of
these old timers. During the meeting
we overheard disoassions and reminis
cences of twenty-five, thirty and even
forty years ago when these self same
men stood aide by side aud defended
their insignifioent worldly possesions
from attacks of the now peaoeable and
oiviltzed Indian tribes.
The attendance at this maeting was
about 2,000 of whioh about 400 were
bonified stookmen. The affitirs of the
organization are in good financial con
dltion and there is every indioatloi of
a large Inorease in membership for the
ensueing year. The following officers
were elected and the report of the
secretary-treasurer, as given below was
unanimously adopted. Additional
Items referring to the meeting will be
found in another column.

Sec. -Treits. Report
Hot Springs, South Dakota, April
10th, 1916.
To the members of the Western
South Dakota Stook Growers Assooi
ation.
Gentlemen: The twenty-tlftb annual
meeting of your organiz ttioa must re
call to the minds of soma of those
present, the congregating of a few
stookmen at the oourt house at Rapid
City, on February 20th, 1892 at whioh
time a temporary organization "was
perfected whioh wa* made permanent
on April 6th, of that year, The growth
of the Association was gradual and in
creased from thirty-six members in
1892 to 677 in 1902 and an average of
bet«e*n 500 and 600 was continued un
til 1909 when the influx of settlers
rendered impossible a continuation of
the range stook business except on a
very email scale. We had 157 listed
members in 1915.
The history of the organization is
somewhat r«mark*hl« from the foot
that there has never been two persons
named for an offloe and the roil has
never been called in an eleotion. You
have bad bat (oar presidents, Messrs
Godard, Bowwd* Pappoa
Five vice-presidents. Messrs. Fred
lloloome, Jno. D. Stevens, Dawson,
Craig and Ham. The latter held the
same office in the temporary organiz
ation twenty-five years ago. But one
secretary-treasurer has ever served
you.
During the life time of the organiz
ation almost $10 000,000 worth of oattle
have been recovered for our members
at the market points. This work was
done at a oost of about 8100,000.00 while
650,000.00 was expended in range de
tective work and proseoutions. Your
interests have been represented and
safeguarded in the State Legislatures,
before the department of agrioulture,
publio lands commission, commission
er of Indian affairs, Iuter-State com
merce commission and other branohes
of the federal government and has held
membership in the Amerioan National
Livestock Association since its in
oeption.
There are many conditions whioh are
responsible for the depraoiation in
our membership, herd law, the settle
ment of the range, several succeeding
years of drouth, the compulsory in
orease in the assessment on horses and
oattle in 1912 and last but by far the
most fatal is the gratuituous protect
ion whioh our inspectors have with the
sanotiou of our officers been giving to
non-members, In explanation of this
feature will say, that it is very neces
sary that our inspeotors work in com
plete harmony with commission firms
and in aotlng In good faith with them
we have been furnishing a tally of all I
oattle in every shipment from the ter
ritory we represent. Furthermore,
when a member failed to list his brands
or pay the dues and assessments we 8
have not removed his brands from our
records, in the belief that it was an
oversight and we would probably catoh
an animal aud thuG secure the amount
properly due us but' this action or
rather laok of action has been taken
advantage of to the extent of seriously
retarding the rtjuvenation of the or
ganizatlon.. It has come to the knowl
edge of members of our exoeutive com- I
mittee that former members have S
failed to oontluue under the impress
sion that 1 heir brands are being pro
teoted and in the event that we re
oover an astray it is perfeotly agreeable
them that we deduct their dues and
assessments from the proceeds of the
animal but if we do not secure an S
estray they have had the protection
without any oost. The prinoipal is
entirely wrong although in the early
years of the organization it worked
satisfactorily. Some plan must be de-£
vised whereby we will only tally oattle
for paid up members.
Many Btookmen fail to appreciate the 1
organization until they lose stock then
they hasten to beoome members and'
immediately demand assistance in the
reoovery of stolen stook or in the pros
ecution of some alleged rustler. Wei
had one request for finanoial assist
ance last fall in a proseoution in which
the injured stockman had not been a
member for five years
The work of the Inspeotors for 1915
6hows that their services are just as
necessary now as at any time in the
pafct:

South Dakota shipped 18,000 more
oattle in 1915 than in 1914,
With this statement of the number
aud value of stook reoovered by onr in
speotors and the further fact that there
were more reported cases of stook
rustling, proportionately than at any
tme during our existence, would it not
be unwise to permit this organization
to pass out of existence? It is possible
that your offioers have beoome dis
couraged by the apathy and laok of in
terest displayed by those who have
been most benefitted and have not
been as aotive as formerly, altbo more
circular letter* and n«r«nn»l appeals
have been sent from the secretary's of
fice daring 1915 than in any previous
year. The qaestion of sostionation or
liquidation is up to the stookmeo. W#
