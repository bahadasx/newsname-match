Evening bun's. ial review today
said: -
In view of theTdisturbing character
of the .Mexican anil German news the
market rendered a good account of it
self in the early trading. There was
liquidation at the outset and prices de
clined, but the heaviest losses were con
fined to industrial specialties and war
stocks which figured in recent pool ac
tivities. The list as a whole strongly
resisted the reactionary forces. Re
covcries in sonio were not fully main
tained and following the iuitiui break,
nnd later movements were irregular but
the general tone was stronger than
might have been expected in the circum
stances. There was little evidence of public
buying but this was not surprising in
view of the overshadowing uncertain
ties. Activity decreased after the first
hour anil the market lapsed into dull
ness awaiting definite news of the cab
inet meeting.
The weight of banking opinion is in
clined to the theory that a severance of
diplomatic relations with Germany is
inevitable. The action may be defer
red, however, it is believed, pending
Germany's receipt of America's final
note. Anyhow, the matter will be tak
en before congress before any definite
steps are taken.
The recovery continued in the late
trading nnd was pronounced iu indus
trial specialties with crucible steel lead
ing. This was attributed to short cov

She vanished several days ago after
leaving Home ostensibly tor the purpose
of marriage. She told, her father and
mother that the prospective bride
groom's mother was ill and that the
ceremony would be very quiet. Return
ing home later, she exhibited a mar
riage certificate and said the event had
occurred at St. John's church here.
Then she left, saying she was going to
Chicago with her husband's 'family.
Nothing has been heard from her
since except a telegram dated Colorado
Springs, stating her husband was killed
there iu an accident. Bernard T. Meo

communicntod with the Colorado
Springs police and they told him there
had been no fatal accident there. In
subsequent messages they informed him
a woman supposed to be his daughter
hail boarded a liio Grande train for the
west.
Inquiry at St. Johns church here
brought the rector a denial that Miss
Meehan had been married there. Now
it is believed the wedding certificate
she exhibited was a false one, and her

Berlin, April 14. Germany is for

able evidence tending to throw light
on the channel packet Sussex explosion.
The foreign office last Tuesday hand
ed Ambassador Gerard two pencil
sketches of the vessel torpedoed near
where the Sussex was damaged These
sketches were made bv officers of the
submarine. Gerard was also given the
London Graphic's photograph of the
Sussex, showing it to be entirely dif-

boat attacked.

Edwin Huxley, first American sur
vivor of the Sussex disaster, to get
home, arrived on the St. Paul. He ridi
culed the German statement that anoth
er ship, not the Sussex, was torpedoed
near it at nlmost the same moment the
terrific explosion killed many aboard
the channel packet.
"We were afloat nine hours after the
explosion," said Huxley. "During that
time we saw no other ship. It seems
that if there had been 'such a vessel
near us we would have heard her wire

The trio confessed that during one
year they manufactured about JMu
bombs. King leaders considered that
10 or 12 of these devices on each ship
was about tho right number. Their fig
ures tally roughly with police estimates
that .'HI fires on allied merchant ships
were caused by the ring's activities.
The bomb makers said they received
14 a week for the work.

WITHDRAW OR INTERVENE
1
Washington, April 14. "The
question in Mexico is whether
we have accomplished all we
can," said Senator Stone today,
after a conference with Secre-
tary Lansing. "I believe we
have. There are enly two ways
left open withdrawal or in-
tervention. ,f
"How long axe we going to
keep the army in Mexico? How
long would we allow a foreign
country to maintain an army In
America? Not very long, I
would say. I have never thought
and do not think now that we
can capture Villa. I have al-
ways thought wo would have to
withdraw without captuiong
him.
"I endorse sendng the troops
in. But it all reverts to a ques-
tion of how long we should keep
them there. If America con-
trolled Mexico, Villa's capture
would be certain, but we are
operating in a foreign country.
"We could suppress any bri-
gandage in our own country,
but we're on foreign soli. Con-
gress can do nothing until Presi-
dent Wilson and the cabinet act
" Of course, I can't prevent de-
bate. Sometimes I wish I
could."
"I am convinced that we can-
not capture Villa with the start .
he has," asserted Stone. "He is
in a friendly country and knows
every foot of it, while our boys
are not familiar with the terri-
tory. We can disperse his bands
but it is like scattering a bunch
of quail they whistle back and
forth and are soon together
again."
There was a possibility that
debate in the senate would be
cut off when it unanimously re-
sumed discussion of the army
bill. Leaders agreed to keep
their hands off until a situation
demanding congressional action
arises.
Senator Smith, of Arizona,
called at the state department
today. Upon leaving he indl-
cated that he was opposed to
the withdrawal of troops from
Mexico uutil Villa is captured
and the safety of the southern
border assured.
Course of Action
Is Decided Upon
By Robert J. Bender,
(I'nited Press staff correspondent.)
Washington, April 14. President
Wilson's final word iu the submarine
controversy with Germany is embodied
in a note the cnbiner ratified today.
It was reported that the note noti
fies Germany another submarine dis
aster jeopardizing Americans will mean
severance of diplomatic relations.
No. hint as to its exact conteurts could
be obtained at the White House. It was
stated that Germany would be informed
of President Wilson's decision 'within n
day or two.
The communication f.t sharp, concise
and permits of no dickering nor of unv
extemied negotiations. It is understood
it touches nut only the Sussex ease but
also presents proof of repeated viola
tions ot German assurances.
The note is said to request not only
punishment for of fending submarine
commanders, but to demand assurances
of a changed submarine policy wliicl
will remove the possinllity of a repeti
tion of the incidents which brought
the nations dangerously near to a
break.
A tentative draft of the communica
tion will be presented to the house
nnd senate foreign committees before
Secretary Lansing shupes it into n
formal message. This may possibly re
sult iu slight changes in its text.
By Robert J. Bender.
(I.'nited Press staff correspondent.)
Washington, April 14. President
Wilson has decided on the course of ac
tion to be taken by this government
toward Germany and announcement of
it will be made within the next 24
hours. This statement was made by n
high official just before today V
cabinet meeting.
He would not comment on what form
the I'nited States government's action
would take, but it is deemed certain
that the president will demand un im
mediate show down without equivoca
tion on the submarine issue. He is s
to be determined that the I'nited Stnles
shall have satisfaction even at the cos'
of severance of diplomatic relations
with ISorlin. It wns stated the executive
had all the facts necessary to set fort'
his position and that there would
no further delay.
Administration members refuse to se
riously consider German contentions in
the kaiser's reply to American inquir
ies about the Sussex. They even ex
pressed amusement at the "naivette"
of Foreign Minister Von Jagow, who
supposedly penned the answer,
A I'nited States dispatch stnling
that Germany wns sending post haste to
this government the submarine com
mander's sketch of the vJsel he snii'
was torpedoed nenr where the Sus"ex
explosion occurred led to the opinion
here thut such a picture would be value
less One official suggested that the
I'-bnnt commander was so busy sketch

lly have erred as to the nnpearanre of
the ship he wan about to destroy.

Is Strongly In Favor

STRONGEST SENTIMENT
IS HATRED OF GRINGOES
Claim Made That 150 Cavalry
men Entering Town Was
Cause of Trouble
By E. T. Conkle.
(I'nited Press Staff Correspondent.)
El Pnso, Texas, April 14. I'nited
States troops at Parrel ure facing a
critical situation, it was reported to
day, uttieiul .Mexican accounts ot the
fight there said a baud of supposed
Villistas defeated by Americans at
Troya on Monday retreated toward Par
ral. The American ' cavalry pursued
them, but found a strong sentiment
against "gringoes at Parral. Tho
clash on Wednesday followed.
It was also reported that forces of
Villistas or independent bandits were
between the advanced American guards
and the base of operations at San An
tonio, .Mexico. A party of 200 attacked
a cattle train three miles from Parral.
This organization may have been
among (ne Mexicans that fought Ameri
cans in the streets of P.irral.
Other bandits in that vicinity defeat
ed the Cnrranzn garrison at Pilar De
Cochos, driving them back into Parral.
The de facto troops at Del Valle were
also beaten bv Guerrili horsemen.
If the Carranza garrison at Parral
joined these Villistas or independents
and fought against the Americans the
situation, it is believed, will become
critical. . ' '
Whether Cnrrnnzistl soldiers partici
pated iu the attack on Americans at
I'nriVl is the most important question.
The Mexican account posted at Juarez
stated that civilians att icked American
troops who entered the city through a
mistake. Jt failed to mention Mexican
casualties, evidently fearing thut such
an announcement would cause more ill
feeling iu the Juarez garrison which is
alreidy reported to be strongly anti
American, Other reports, however, snid that tho
constitutionalist officers could not eon
trol their men, and that soldiers partici
pated in the attack. The fact that the
mayor of J'nrrul is the father of General
liiiis Ilerrera is considered significant.
General Ilerrera is still regarded as the
leader of an anti-American element in I
the Carranzistu army despite his cor
dill meeting with General Pershing rci
eently.
.lames Lord, a prominent mining man
of Sonorn, predicted today that the
news of Carninzn V request l'or Ameri
can withdrawal would be spread to ev
ery hamlet nnd that massacres of nany
white inhabitants as well as of Ameri
can soldiers might be expected.
Say Fighting Continues.
San Antonio, Texas, April 14. Army
headquarters today anxiously nwiited
Itngadier General John J. Pershing
report with regard to the fight engaged j
in by loO American soldiers who werej
attacked by Mexicans at Parrall. Thej
latest Mexicm reports indicated that i
the fighting continues, with the mob,
greatly outnumbering the Americans. I
In a second outburst of hute againstj
the "gringoes," many Mexicans were,
reported to have been killed. It was
said that the cavalry turned a battery
of in ichiuc guns on the mob. i
Some 1'eared that unorgunizcil ban-
Oils might have cut off a detachment1
separated from the main column audi
prevented the news from reaching'
Pershing. It was believed that a force)
thus surrounded might possibly facoj
serious casu illy fighting its way out.

Failure to Withdraw With
Honor from Mexico Means
Intervention
Washington, April 14. American
troops will remain in Mexico for the
present at least. The cabinet at its
session today determined not to change
its policy. This mcuns the hunt for
Villa will proceed.
After the cabinet session it was stat
ed that Cnrranzn 's request for with
drawal of American forcos had not
been answered. Consul Bodgers in Mex
ico City has not been instructed to
trent with Carranza toward an amicable
settlement. The cabinet members failed
to indicate when they intended to reply
to the request.
No light on President Wilson s stana
during tho cabinet meeting was ob
tuinalile. Lack of definite information on
events led Carranza yesterday to wire
a renewal of his request that the Amer
icans withdraw and this prevented the
cabinet from deciding on its future
courso. But for the present, it was
made clear that there would be nu
change. The cabinet members unanim
ously decided to gather all the facts,
before attempting finul action.
By Lowell Mellett.
(United Press staff correspondent.)
Washington, April 14. Momentarily
forgetting the threatened brcuk with
Germany, official Washington sought
an answer today to these questions:
"What were the facts at PnrrM.
where American soldiers fought Mexi
cans with the loirs of an American
lifct"
"What will President Wilson do?"
It was hoped that a reply to the 'first
quostion would be found in Brigadier
General John J. Pershing's dispatches,
supplementing the reports from ('arran-
zista sources.
The cabinet wns expected to answer
tho sdfond inquiry. There was reason
to believe the president would meet
his advisers with his nirnd made up that
withdrawal of United States soldiers
from Mexico is essential to the humani
tarian purpose for which they entered.
President Wilson lust niirht turned
lira Jefferson day address to demo
cratic lenders into u challenge, asking;
in effect: "Have you the courugo to
come out?"
His words puzzled the banqueters. If
tho president's statements meant that
he proposed a withdrnwul ot troops it
was indicated that such a move would
meet opposition in his own party.
President Wilson is knowu to belicvo
that intervention will undo bis thren
years' work iu which ho sought to allow
tho Mexicans to save themselves, fl
feels that failure to find a means
whereby the American columns muy
withilraw with honor from Arexico
means intervention.
President Wilson recognizes that a
fight in his own ranks may develop, it
is believed, as he told the banqueters:
"I um not interested in personal ambi
tions. 1 am not enthusiastic over mem
party success."
While the trouble nt.Purrul temporar
ily overshadowed the task o'i catching
Francisco Villa, arm., men indicated a
fear that the bandit had escaped and
that only with Carranza 'a co operation
could the, Ainericnas hope to overtake
him.
Secretary of War Baker would not
comment with regaiil to the request for
withdrawal of American troops. He said
that tieneral Funstou had been given
a free hand to control the Parral situa
tion. Baker's understanding i thut
there is no objection to the passage of
troops through towns on the line of
innrch, though the soldiers have been
ordered not to occupy any settlements.
It is likely that Consul Itodgers wilt
confer with Carrunza in Mexico City.
Although Secretary Baker would not
verify the report, it was learned Gen
eral Funston had asked for additional
troops nnd had suggested that the main
-supply base be established at Ojinaga.
