QFNATÍ.R SHFRMAN
IS LOOMING UP
olitical Experts Sec More
Than un Equal Chance for
Illinois' Favorito Sou fo
Presidential Nomination
COLONEL ROOSEVELT IS ALSO
MAKING A SHOWING
Tho ' following telegram from
Washington City to the Chicago
Tribuno looks very encouraging for
Seontor Bherinan, Illinois' favorite
sou for the presidency:
Hughes and Hoosevolt continue
tho biggest figures in tho politicians'
guesses about resulta of tho .June
convention, and there is nosutiofiu;
lion with the former's declarations
about, his plans thus far mudo
"No one ventures lo say til
justice wishes the nomination, but
neither does any ono dare say he
docs not wish it. The colonel looms
big, mainly because ho always has
loomed big, and I ho developments
in Europe and in Mexico have not
tended to make him look n bit
smaller.
"The wise men look for a choice
between theao two leading candi
daten itinl tho host of favorito sons
who have bean presented for
national consideration within- re
cent month;
"Tho eastern section of tho conn
try is awakening to tlio strength of
Senator Lawrence Y 8hcrmau o
Illinois, atlhouuh for obvious rea
suns the idea has been oncouruged
that Senator Sherman's candidacy
is merely n local proposition.
''Cumulative developments, how
ever, backed up by the Investiga
lions of experts who have been
sizing up thn situation In the
middlo west, indicate that Senator
Sherman has as much, if not inoic,
outside support nt I lie present
moment I holt any other eaudhlai
will) a home stato backing To marl
with, it Is generally understood
that Senator Sherman will have the
solid delegation from Illinois, tho
third largest of all, when the fiist
IihIIoI is polled at Chicago. Tho
observers from Ilia east have dis
entered ihatllils formidubloHiipport
by no means forms his limit, when
the second cholo? bwtinesH is con
sidcred
"In a resumo today of tho Mltu
Hon In dale the New York Herald's
political expert slates that thus far
Fairbanks of Indiada and Cummins
of luwa aro the only candidates to
have delegates lurtrtictod for them.
He adds that in both theso groups
of delegates, however, there are
men who aro favorable to Sherman
and former Senator Murtón of Ohio
An accompanying article from a
correspondent who lyis been louring
tho west, mukes speeillo mention of
the conditions In Kansas Oklahoma
and AikaiiHus, where it is. found
that n strong Sherman sentiment
has bten developed. Reports reach
ing Washington indicate that there
also Is a strong undercurrent of Slier
nun sentiment in Missouri, Wlscou
sin, and Minnesota."
EXPENSIVE "VIVAS"
"Vivas" for Pancho Villa come
high sometimes, as was amply de
monstrated in Corrlroto ono night
this week. Don't ask us for any
details, but they're expensive if we
ore reliably informed.
