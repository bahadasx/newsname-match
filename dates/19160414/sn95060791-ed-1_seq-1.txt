A meeting of the stockholders

whom are residents of Holbrook.
At this stockholders' meeting

Burglar t in Snow flake
The Snowflake postoffice and
the general merchandise store of
J. M. Flake in that town were
burglarized last Saturday night.
Entrance to the postoffice was
gained by breaking the lock on
the tront door. The Flake store
was entered through the front
door presumably by means of a
skeleton key, the door standing
wide open Sunday morning when
the proprietor come down town.
A considerable quantity of
merchandise was stolen from the
Flake store, and some merchan
dise and stamps from the post
office. There is no clue to the
thief or thieves.
Wingate Station May Open
The proposal of the govern
ment to re-garrison Ft. Wingate
in July is given further evidence
of being the truth from the fact
the Santa Fe railroad is making
arrangements to re-open the
station at Wingate. The re-garrisoning
of the fort would be a
benefit to this city financially
and gives this whole section of
country the protection of the
army. The mistake was made
in abandoning the fort and the
news of its re-occupation is wel
come in this city. Gallup Her
ald. Residence in Winslow Burglarized
Last Sunday night the resi
dence of Dr Ross G. Bazell in
Winslow was burglarized, and
jewelery to the value of $150 was
stolen. The thief cut the screen
from a window in the bathroon
and entered through the window.
Part of the jewelery was on a
dressing table in the bathroom
and the balance taken was in the
bedroom adjoining. At the time
of the burglary the members of
the family were away from home.
There is no clue to the perpetra
tors of the crime.
Appointed Liquidating Agent
In the sale of the Navajo
Apache Bank and Trust Company
to T. M. Quebedeaux and as
sociates only a part of the assets
of the company were transferred.
Those assets not transferred con
sist of notes, mortgages and
other securities; these were re
tained by the old corporation and
will be liquidated as rapidly as
possible.
The liquidation of these assets,
vvhick aggregate a large sum of
money, will require considerable
time, possibly two or three years,
and in the liquidation some suits
at law may arise. It was there
fore deemed advisable by the
stockholders to whom was left
the business of realizing on the
unsold assets of the bank to ap
point as their agent an attorney.
At the same time they wanted a
man of good business ability,
and of unimpeachable integrity.
Such a man they found in
Clarence H. Jordan, county at
torney of Navajo county. Mr.
Jordan was therefore given the
appointment of liquidating agent
for the stockholders, and will
start work as soon as some de
tails have been arranged.

A large number of farmers in
Coconino county will plant pota
toes this year, the soil and cli
mate of that section of the state
having been found well adapted
to the growing of this vegetable.
This is an example that might
be followed by the farmers in
Navajo county. Good potatoes
may be grown on the mesas
without irrigation, and there is
no branch of the farming in
dustry that pays better profits
than potato raising, when suffici
ent quantities are growm to
make it profitable to ship in car
load lots.
The Holbrook base ball club
trimmed the Snowflake club
last Saturday afternoon on the
Holbrook grounds by a score of
19 to 7. The game was too one
sided to be very interesting al
though a fair size crowd re
mained on the grounds until the
close. The Snowflake boys
claimed that they were work
ing several inexperienced men,
but it is doubtful if the result
would have been different had
all the regulars been in the play.
The Holbrook boys played good
ball and their victory Saturday
was easy.

that the committee will soon
have final arrangements made
for the starting of the building.

Field Notes from the Ofñce
of the County Engineer
That portion of the Winslow
Hol brook road near Clear Creek
has been surfaced with a coat of
gravel, making an excellent road
bed. This is a piece of work
which has been needed for a
long time. With little exception
the whole road is now in good
condition.
A section of the St. Joseph
road has been graded and crown
ed and as soon as the concrete
water way is finished will be
another long called for improve
ment. Work on Contract No. 17-1916,
on the Ream's Canyon road, is
now in progress and probably
will be finished the coming week.
Forms for the final pouring of
concrete of the Shumway bridge
are now in place, but the present
rains will delay this work again.
Concrete pouring of the west
abutment of the Taylor bridge is
nearly completed and the repairs
of the steel work are in progress.
All of this work will be now
pushed to a completion.
Several contracts on the Snow
flake and Petrified Forest roads
wijl soon be started.
Contract No. 13-1C16. between
Snowflake and Taylor, was a
warded March 18, 1916, to a resi
dent of Snowflake, but work has
not yet been commenced.
Owing to the work in progress
in the different parts of the coun
ty the engineer's car is continual
ly on the road.
.Petitions for new roads and
alterations of old ones continue
to be presented in increasing
numbers. The surveys and
maps of those already declared
are necessarily somewhat delay
ed. The Snowflake bridge across
Silver Creek is a total wreck and
two entirely new spans will be
placed. The old alignment was
faultv and the cause of its de
molishment. Relative to changes in loca
tions of bridges and the present
traveled roads, it is advisable be
fore any permanent work is per
formed to have these matters
finally settled. Petitions for all
changes should be sent to this
office so that all necessary legal
steps can be properly attended
to.
The new county road planer
(Uncle Jim) is now at Holbrook
and on the arrival of the Cater-
rpiilar Tractor, which has been
shipped from the factory at
Stockton, will be placed in use.
On the whole, road business is
picking up.
Tell your road troubles to the
engineer and he will do his best
to satisfy all.

County Engineer..
Plans Submitted for
School Building
R. H. Tuttle, division super
en tendent of the Santa Fe Rail
road company, and R. H. Wells,
the company's architect, were in
Holbrook yesterday and spent
considerable time in consulation
with the local school board rela
tive to the proposed new school
building.
Mr. Wells had prepared a set
of blue-print plans for a building,
which he estimates can be con
structed for the amount of money
available. These plans provide
for a building 50 by 78 feet in size
with two full stories and a base
ment under the entire building.
The Kewanee water system is
specified and brick is to be used
in the construction.
Some slight alterations were
suggested by members of the
school board and these will be
incorporated into the plans by
Mr. Wells, and specifications will
be prepared by him. The board
will them be in a position to ask
for bids on the building.
