STANFORD MADE
FINE SHOWING
Hearty Welcome Extended to
Knoxville Trade Boosters Here
Wednesday Morning.
"The handsomest reception we
Have received anywhere on our big
Boosting trip," was what more than
one of the Knoxville business men
who pent Iss tha 1 ar hour in Sta:.
ford Wednesday morning, said of the
greeting and reception which the vis
itors were given here.
Probably no "liver" bunch of bus
iness men have ever come to Stan
ford than were in the delegation of
representative Knoxville merchants
and manufacturers who made a whirl
through the eastern section of Ken
tucky Tuesday and Wednesday. At
every point where they stopped they
radiated good fellowship and good
cheer, and here at Stanford, they
were handed as good as they gave.
Arriving early Wednesday morn
ing, before many country people get
to town as a usual thing, they were
met nevertheless by the largest
crowd which they said had so far
greeted them on their travels. The
graded and high school children were
drawn up in a line at the depot as the
special pulled in and made a brave
and inspiring show. The youngsters
joined in the parade down town, and
augmented considerably the big
crowd which had gathered to honor
the guests.
The special train of four Pullmans
upon which the Knoxville tourists
traveled, pulled into Rowland prompt
ly on time at 8 :45 Wednesday morn
ing, where it was met by Secretary
Jay H. Howenstine, of the Stanford
Chamber of Commerce, .together
wth a committee composed of Wm.
Severance, J. N. Saunders, W. B. Mc
Kinney, D. M. Walker and S. M. Sau
fley, who quickly scattered through
the cars, told what was awaiting at
Stanford a mile up the road, and gave
out literature telling who is who
and why in Stanford. Copies of
Tuesday's I. J., were also given each
member of the visiting body, which
they seemed pleased to get, and said
that ti was the first newspaper they
had seen since leaving Knoxville.
Trainmaster W. O. Dilly, of Leb
anon, was at Rowland and under his
supervision, the switch up the road
to Stanford was quickly made, where
the University of Tennessee Band, in
full uniform quickly debouched .and
with Knoxville .and Stanford business
men marchine side by side, the pro
cession was led to the courthouse,
where the formal exercises were held.
It had been planned to have the
speeches made in the circuit court
room, but the crowd was too large,
and the courthouse steps were used
for a rostrum. Attorney K. S. Al
corn, in a few words, delivered an
appropriate welcome on behalf of
Stanford and Lincoln county, which
was followed by a response from
Judge Lindsey on behalf of the vis
itors. Rev. George Stewart, a noted
minister and lecturer, of East Tenn
essee, who was with the excursion
ists, then made a speech which was
the feature of the day in that line.
He was introduced by Rev. D. M.
Walker in a few appropriate words.
Rev. Stewart has a nation-wide rep
utation for his effective oratory, and
he made a great impression upon ev
eryone. In the meanwhile Knoxville and
Stanford business men were com
mingling, a moving picture operator
was taking scenes in Stanford which
will be shown at the opera house
later, and a spirit of good fellowship
and business and social congeniality
was engendered which will long be
remembered by these representative
citizens of the two communities.
The stay here was of only about
half an hour but it was enjoyed ev
ery minute of it, by Stanford and
Knoxville alike. The visitors made
a fine impression upon all with whom
they came in contact. They wore
uniform white caps and carried uni
form sun shades or umbrellas, and
were on the hustle all the time, boost
ing their home town, its men and
business interests and inviting ex
tension of the cordial business rela
tions which already prevail between
them and those of this part of Ken
tucky. Tennessee is a dry state,
"having state-wide prohibition, and
not a drop of anything intoxicating
to drink was carried on the train,
which of itself was something very
unusual. From Stanford the spe
cial went to Crab Orchard. It came
here from Lancaster, and at both
points nice crowds greeted it.
DEBATE AT MARETBURG.
There will be a public discussion
between Evangelist J. L. Davis and
J. G. Sowards, at Maretburg, for
two days, April 21 and 22, beginning
at 10 a. m., on the 21st. Mr. Sow
ards could not leave his business to
meet Davis at Providence March 27,
so he has invited Davis to come to
Maretburg and debate with him. So
Davis has accepted.
AVOID SPRING COLDS
Sudden changes, high winds, shift
ing seasons cause colds and grippe,
and these spring colds are annoying
and dangerous and are likely "to turn
into a chronic summer cough. In
.such cases take a treatment of Dr.
King's New Discovery, a pleasant
Laxative Tar Syrup. It soothes the
cough, checks the cold and helps
break up an attack of grippe. Its
already prepared, no mixing or fuss
ing. Just ask youb druggist for a
bottle of Dr. King's New Discovery.
Tested and tried for over 40 years.
LOCAL MARINE MAKES GOOD.
In an official bulletin issued by
Headquarters, United States Marine
Corps, Washington, appears the name
of William R. Cowan of this place,
as having qualified as a marksman
in that most interesting branch of the
Government service. William Cowan,
who is a son of Mrs. Charity Cowan,
R. D. 1, Stanford, enlisted in the
United States Marine Corps at its
Atlanta, Ga., recruiting station on
December 14, 1915, and is now serv
ing at the marine barracks, Port
Royal, S. C, awaiting transfer to
expeditionary dutyj, where he will
have many interesting experiences
and adventures, or to a cruising bat
tleship which will visit strange lands
and give the Stanford youth an ex
cellent opportunity to see the world.
Considering the fact that Cowan is
scarcely more than a recruit, his per
formance in gunnery is looked upon
by Marine Corps officials as little
short of marvelous, and they expect
him to break many markmanship rec
ords before his enlistment expires.
LATEST FROM MEXICO.
American cavalry, under Major
Tompkns, was fired upon by a Mexi
can mob at Parral Wednesday. Al
though the numerous reports fail to
agree on the number of casualties it
has been fairly well established that
only one American trooper was killed.
When attacked by the Parral mob
the American force withdrew and
camped, but was attacked again la
ter in the night.
The Parral incident was seized up
on by Gen. Carranza for a renewal of
his request transmitted earlier in the
day that the American forces be
withdrawn from Mexico. The de fac
to leader in his note transmitted thru
the Washington Embassy stated that
permission had never been given for
the expeditionary force to enter and
that the Americans had done so un
der a misunderstanding. Indications
in Washington last night were that
the demand would not be complied
with until the object of the expedi
tion had been accomplished.
Steps' were taken along the border
yesterday to watch all Carranza col
umns that might menace American
line of communication.
WAYNESBURG SCHOOL GROWS.
A new room is being added to the
Waynesburg Graded School, and four
teachers will be needed the coming
term to take care of the large num
ber of pupils who now attend this
popular and splendid educational in
stitution in the southern part of the
county. S. P. Shoop has the con
tract for the carpentiy work and ti.
H. Singleton is furnishing the lum
ber for the addition to the building.
R. R. Damron, or the West End,
sold to the lamb buying firm of Mc
Cormack & Company, of Hustonville,
100 lambs at 9 1-2 cents a pound.
The lambs are engaged to go the first
ten days in June. Mr. Damron en
gaged the wool from his sheep at
Judge W. M. Myers at 37 cents a
pound.
IMPROVING THEIR HOMES.
Alfred Pence is having built a
porch to the back of his home on
Lancaster avenue and is enlarging
and improving the one in front. It
will materially improve the appear
ance and comfort of his cozzy home.
Sam Robinson is enlarging the porti
co of his home on Portman avenue
and building a pavement in front
of it. More building and improving
is going on in Stanford at present
than in a long time, and there's a
reason it's the best town on the
map.
NATHAN BELDEN NO MORE.
Nathan Belden, died at his home
in Louisville Monday. He was a
former resident of Stanford, and was
30 years old. His remains were laid
to rest in Cave Hill cemetery, Louis
ville, Wednesday morning. He is

$500 FOR ROWLAND PEAVINE
J. C.
Bailey Buys Fine Young Sire
At Dudderar's Sale.
The saddle horse stock owned by
the late Carroll Dudderar brought
good and satisfactory prices when
put up at auction here Monday in
order to wind up his estate. A tre
mendous crowd attended the sale,
and bidding was spirited as most of
the offerings were bred in the pur
ple. The feature of the sale was the
sale of Rowland Peavine 6053, a
splendid young chestnut stallion by
the great sire Rex Peavine. This
youngster gives promise of develop
ing into a very handsome aged stal
lion, and is already becoming popu
lar as a sire. J. C. Bailey, of this
city, bought him for $500. Wils Ro
gers of Paint Lick paid $201 for the
royally bred mare Bourboniste;
James Chrisman bought Preston
Gay. a yearling colt by High Cloud;
W. H. Murphy paid $122 for Lucy P.
a famous brood mare; John Spoona
more bought Jessie Deane, another

sold here to W. 0. Walker at a profit
of $5 for $35; Les Sloan, of Hubble,
bought a yearling filly by All Peavine
for $106 and sold her afterward to
W. O. Walker for $110.
HUNTING FOR GOLD.
It was reported many years ago
that some one had buried a lot of
gold money on the farm of J. F. Go
ver, in the West End and several
times in the last decade he has seen
evidence of people hunting the hid
den treasure, but not until last week
did he know what a determined ef
fort was being made to locate the
money. On going over that part of
his farm which borders nearest to
Peyton's Well, he found a hole about
ten feet long by four feet wide and
nine or ten feet deep, which had evi
dently been dug by the searchers.
Whether their efforts were or were
not rewarded Mr. Gover does not
know that they spent a good deal of
time and energy in their search. The
work was done at night and rather
than have any more loss of sleep over
the matter Mr. Gover suggests that
the effort to locate the money be put
forth in day time and in the event it
is found he will make a liberal divi
sion of the lucre.

An estimable and" -snared Ken
tucky woman has askUe to write
something about Georfetp. Barnes,
the beloved "mountaiivangelist,"
whose memory is venerated in ten
thousand households of the "Old
Commonwealth" to thisday. I gave
it as my opinion the olher day that
Matt Carpenter was thegreatest or
ator I ever heard. I jdid not have
the pulpit in mind. Iwas speaking
of matters entirely secular, Worldly,
political, civic. J '.
We judge orators by .many things.
One, and perhaps the chief of these,
is the effect that an address has up
on the audience. Puerto this test
Brother Barnes was byfar the great
est orator I ever heattd. He was a
tall, graceful handsome man, with
more of the quality called "magne
tism" than any other JI ever saw
and I've seen Blaine andjBeecher and
Bryan yet he mightrnave been a
failure as an orator hajflfhe not been
endowed in such abundance with that
other and even more essential qual
ity in a platform speaker, sincerity.
With a highly cultivated, splendid
intellect, with a nobleStontempt for
the material and sensuous things in
life, with the broadest charity for
all human weaknesses, with a sublime
trust in the Master and a resolute
courage to do his Master's will, with
the love of God filling nis,great heart
to overflowing. George O. Barnes
preached the Gospel (of Christ and
planted the love of God and the peace
that passes understanding in the
hearts of thousands fjthis fellows
theretofore heavy ladenand wretch-
" I am onlv one off thousands who
.cahdeyo'iilly thimkr-G-ihminl
lsiry oi xms great preacner oi Jtiis
word. Before I heard him my poor
intellectuals were subject to the in
fluence of Tom Paine; but soon he
set me free. Since then I have read
the skepticisms of Bolingbroke and
heard the blasphemous Ingersoll with
out the slightest adherence to either.
George O. Barnes was born in Ken
tucky in 1827, the son of James C.
Barnes, a clergyman of the Presby
terian faith, yet venerated and, be
lieved in the Bluegrass Region. He
was a John Knox-of-a-man and in
the Master's cause cheerfully he
would have gone to the stake, and
of him might have been said what
Murray said of Knox, "he never
feared to look on the face of a man."
After graduating at Princeton "Fa
ther" Barnes found a wife and help
meet in Maria Stockton Smith, of
New Jersey, who was even more ex
traordinary as a woman than her hus
band was as a man. To them were
born four children, George Owen the
youngest.
In the material things of this
world the family was very poor, but
it was a household of ten thousand
and that humble roof-tree might well
have excited the envy of the great
who dwell in many a palace and sway
many a realm. By the exercise of
the most rigid economy George was
enabled to attend the famous Centre
College at Danville, then presided
over by John C. Young, whose su
perior as a trainer of youth, men
tally and morally, our country never
knew. After his graduation, young
Barnes entered the office of an emi
nent Kentucky lawyer, Squire Tur
ner, at Richmond, Madison county,
as a student. He was only 19 years
of age and in a few weeks there was
a call for volunteers to fight in the
Mexican war. He was one of the first
to respond, and in less than three
days Captain Stone's company was
raised. In thirty minutes the farm
WOUNDED BY A ROOSTER
Ham, Smith, who lives East of
Rowland, was the subject of a
rooster's wrath the other day and
was painfully wounded in a fight
with his cockship. Mr. Smith was
killing a chicken, when the roost
er attacked him In a furious man
ner and put up a stiff fight. He
parleyed with the game chicken
for awhile but later had the fight
of his life. In ihe scramble, the
rooster stuck fcis spur thru one
of TVfr. Smith's hands, inflicting a
most painful wound. Bfi had to
almost kill the maddened cock
before he could make him give
up the fight. -

ers of Madison county furnished,
without charge to the government,
the horses, thorobreds, to mount it,
and the company became a part of
the Kentucky regiment commanded
by Humphrey Marshall. Young
Barnes was the tallest man in the
regiment and the most popular sol
dier. Overflowing with animal spir
its, he led in every pardonable mis
chief, tho nothing vicious ever came
from him.
After the war Barnes heeded a
call to the ministry and attended the
Theological Seminary of Princeton
College, where he was graduated.
Then he became a regularly ordain
ed minister of the Presbyterian
church. Upon his graduation he
took for wife, Miss Jane Cowan, of
Kentucky, and suffice it to say she
was fit mate for this wonderful man.
They went to India where they were
missionaries for some years, until the
health of the husband failed, when
they returned to Kentucky and Bro
ther Barnes became the pastor of a
flock at Stanford.
An amusing story is told of Dean
Gaisford, of Oxford University, who
began a passage of one of his ser
mons thus. "St. Paul says, and" I
partly agree with him." Brother
Barnes was even more candid, and
after he became an evangelist is was
his frequent custom to say, when ex
pounding a passage of scriptures:
"Paul was theologizing there." His
imagination, an inheritance from that
wonderful woman, his mother, would
have been riotous had it not been
held in subjection by his masterful
understanding. His sermons were as
absorbing and entertaining as Dic
kens or Thackeray, and he never
tired. His knowledge of the Bible
was there. His sermons on Rahab
and Zaccheus were exquisite, won
derful. Utterly unconscious of the
gift, George O. Barnes was one of
the greatest actors the world ever
saw. On the histrionic stage he
would have rivaled Garrick himself.
As was inevitable, orthodoxy could
not stand for George Barnes. He
was tried for heresy, and either cut
loose, or. was cut loose, from the
church. A Kentuckian, a Mr. Ows
ley, an opulent citizen of Chicago,
built a fine church in that city and
ggstundertopk Lthe ministry. He
'joihedTvitn the 'famouV'Ttloody in a
series of meetings and was a great
er Moody. He felt the call to go
forth and preach the Gospel "without
scrip or purse," urged to do so by
Moody.
Soon thereafter we find him again
in Kentucky, proclaiming the Gospel
in the mountains. For years he was
so employed, and abundant was the
harvest. The Governor of the Com
monwealth confessed Christ at one
of his meetings and thousands of
others great and obscure, did like
wise. He went to Ohio, to Indiana,
to New York City, and wherever he
appeared blessings followed in his
wake. He crossed the ocean and
preached in London and the rest of
his life he devoted to the work of his
Master, proclaiming the one transcen
dent, overwhelming truth, the root
of all good that God is love, and
nothing else.
Here is what he said of Bob Inger
soll: "But, gentleman as he is, schol
ar as he is, intellectual giant as
he is, and, above all, attacking a
theological God who is wholly
indefensible by Dr. Talmage or
Judge Black, or anybody else, he
stands upon such vantage ground
that I do not wonder he is
sweeping the decks by his ora
tory and making infidels of thou
sands of the best thinkers of our
nation, old and young. And I
frankly confess here, as I have
often said from the platform,
that if I had no other God than
the God whom Col. Ingersoll so
fiercely, justly, and successfully
assails, I would gladly take re- "
fuge as he does, in the only
comfortable thought left, that
there is no God.
"Oh, if he only knew my God,
the God and Father of our Lord
Jesus Christ. I believe he would
love and trust and preach Him,
as I do, while abating not a whit
his opposition to the devil en
throned, whom so many thous
ands in and out of the church
are trying to worship and serve,
how successfully let the dead
churches and the deader church
goers witness. The stream rises
not higher than its source."
I have not the space, and I am not
worthy, if I had, to attempt a word
regarding Brother Barnes' devoted
daughter, Miss Marie. She was with
him in both hemispheres, supporting
him in his blessed ministry. She is
an ornament to womanhood and thou
sands will bless her memory after
she shall have .joined her father in
INJURED BY MAD HOG
Morrison Bright Badly Cut on Leg
By Enraged Brute's Tusk
While driving hogs on the Bright
farm Thursday afternoon Morrison
Bright sustained a very severe inju
ry. A boar and stag got to fighting
and while attempting to separate
them the stag made a lunge at Mr.
Bright and struck him with his tusk
on the left leg between the knee and
hip. The tush, which is both long and
sharp, went to the bone, cutting the
muscle and making a horrible gash
three or four inches long. Fortunate
ly the hog made no further fight or
Mr. Bright would have been fatally
hurt. Physicians were summoned
and gave him immediate attention.
He was put under the influence of
chloroform while the wound was
dressed, and today is doing as well
as could be expected. The wound is
an exceedingly painful one and it is
probable that young Bright will be
laid up for some time.
"HOME COMING" PLANNED.
The Lexington Chamber of Com
merce is planning an old-fashioned
Home Coming for central and east
ern Kentucky, and is asking all of
the county organizations in those
sections to co-operate, which they
will undoubtedly gladly do. A pre
liminary meeting was held at Lexing
ton Thursday, and much interest
manifested. It is planned to adver
tise extensive inducements to all ex
Kentuckians who have gone from this
end of the state, to "Come Back
Home" for a visit at a designated
time this summer, and make the oc
casion one to be remembered always.
Another meeting will be held next
week. The Lexington promoters
have been assured that the Stanford
Chamber of Commerce wil co-operate
in every possible way.

ABLE DANVILLE
PASTOR RESIGNS
Rev. H. C. Garrison Forced by Health
to Give Up Pastorate of Big
Christian Church.
Rev. H. C. Garrison, the beloved
pastor of the Danville Christian
church, has resigned as pastor, and
at a called meeting of the Board held
there Thursday night, the resigna
tion was accepted. The members of
the official board, and the entire con
gregation were very averse to sever
ing the ties with their leader, and the
board only decided to recommend ac
ceptance of his resignation, after it
had been represented to it that Dr.
Garrison earnestly desired that the
church release him.
Dr. Garrison has been in very poor
health for some time. He has been
in Florida and at other health re
sorts for some months in the hopo
of recovering his strength, but has
been unable to entirely eliminate the
incipient malady from his system, but
decided upon the earnest advice of
his physician, to relinquish the work
which he loves so well and in which
he has been such a shining light in
the Master's Cause. It is understood
to be his plan to devote all of his
time for an indefinite period to out
door rest and recreation in an effort
to rebuild his waning strength.
The action of the official board of
the church in accepting his resigna
tion will be reported to the church
body Sunday, with the recommenda
tion that the church formally concur
in its action. Afterward, it is ex
pected, that the church will author
ize the board to act as a committee
or appoint a committee for the pur
pose of securing a new pastor.
The Danville Christian church re
cently finished and dedicated a new
building, which is one of the hand
somest and most complete in every
way church homes in the state. It is
said to have cost close to $100,000.
ANNIE V. CRAIG WINS TRIP
Last September the Mozart Club
of the Stanford High School began a
contest among its members, which
has just closed. The work done in
this contest was in Musical History
and Harmony. Miss Ellen Ballou
gave the examination and sent the
papers to Miss Mary Venable, College
of Music, Cincinnati, who graded
them. The papers were numbered
in order that the authors could not
be detected. Miss Venable writes as
follows: "Of the fifteen papers,
written by the Mozart Club, those
numbered two. four and six, are
equally good in Musical History.
The papers numbered four and six
were equally good in Harmony. The
paper numbered two was the best
submitted in harmony." Number two
is Annie V. Craig; number four is
Gertrude Gaines, and number six is
Nancy K. McKinney. According to
Miss Venable's rating, Annie V.
Craig wins first place and Gertrude
Gaines and Nancy K. McKinney tie
for second. The winner gets a trip
to the May Festival in Cincinnati with
all expenses paid. Quite an honor
to attain such distinction and espe
cially so when one considers that the
winner had to compete with fourteen
others who worked like Trojans to
get first place.

MEECE GOT SIX MONTHS.
A dispatch from Covington last
week said. Judge Cochran, in the
United States Court at Covington.
Thursday, sentenced a number of
prisoners, who had been indicted for
various offenses. "Call Perry H.
Meese," instructed the court. Meese
is the man who shot Deputy U. S.
Marshal Charles Winfrey. Deputy
Marshal Arthur and Special Deputies
Tick Armstrong and Percy Howell
escorted Meese in the court room.
"Meese. yoh were found guilty of
using the mails. Have you anything
to say before sentence is passed?"
asked the court. With head bowed,
and sobbing, the prisoner said:
"Judge, there is just my mammy ana
me at home, and I am needed to make
crops. I thought there was money
due me when I sent those checks.
Can't you let me go home, Judge?"
"Perry, if you had not shot at that
deputy marshal, but had surrendered
properly, your case mght have been
given further consideration. It is
the judgment of the court that you
serve six months in jail."

troubled with kidneys and bladder
for a good many years," writes Ar
thur Jones, Allen, Kans. "My age
is against me to ever get cured, but
Foley's Kidney Pills do me more good
than, anything I ever tried." Rheu
matism, aching back, shooting pains,,
stiff joints, irregular action, all have
been relieved. Sold everywhere.
