VIOLENT BOMBARDMENT BY THE
GERMANS WEST OF THE
MEUSE
Ity ANMOi-lnlril Vrmm, l
LONDON, Apr. 14. The French
losltiona near hill 304 Verdun west
of the Meuse were subjected to vio
lent bombardment today. East of the
Meuse there was a recrudescence of
activity on the part of the Germans
although no heavy actions were re
corded, according to a Paris communi
cation. " -
The Turkish war office re'ported the
defeat of three Russian cavalry regi
ments by Persians and Turks in Per
sian armenia. A British announce
ment says the British defeated the
Turks in Mesopotamia and drove them
back from one to three miles.
The Germans have been obliged to
pause In order to fill up the gaps in
their ranks, to replace damaged guns
and to bring up munitions. It Is be
lieved that the French command is
not likely to modify its methods. Gen.
Petaln is said to be quite satisfied as
long as the Germans go on losing
three times as many men as the
French for unimportant results, as he
knows that he has ample reserves to
press a counter attack on a large
scale when the opportune time comes
and stocks of ammunition are praeti
cally inexhaustible.
Since the first month of the war the
output of three Inch shells In France
Increased 33 V6 times. Twenty-three
times as many 75-millimeter guns are
being made as in August, 1914, and
the manufacture of heavy guns has In
creased In the same ratio,
