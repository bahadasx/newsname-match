DAIRYING PAYS
BIG RETURNS
Western Washington Farmers
Secure Large Profits From
Dairying and Co-Operative
Creameries.
The following article regarding
dairying in western Washington
should prove of interest to our
readers at this time and, while
this section cannot compare with
the Whatcom county dairy sec
tions, if dairying can be made a
leading industry there we can
see no reason why it cannot be
come a valuable adjunct to gen
eral farming here if given a fair
trial. The article follows.
The man with a few good dairy
cows and industry and patience to
bring their producing capacity up
to the highest point is sure of a
good income when he sends his
cream to the creamery. But when
he goes farther and becomes a
co-operative partner in the
creamery he does better, as has
been shown on more than one oc
casion in these columns. Of
course every co-operative cream
ery does not prove a financial
success, but where the conditions
are right and the management of
the factory is in honest, business
like hands, the cream check gen
erali / proves that this kind of co
operation pays.
There are many co-operative
creameries in the Pacific north
west. One that is well to the
fore is the Lynden creamery, lo
cated in the little town of Lyn
den, Whatcom county, Wash., in
one of the finest dairy sections in
the entire northwest. The Nook
sack yalley, as it is known, is a
fairly broad, level section adapt
ed particularly to dairying. It
has been settled largely by thrif
ty Dutch people and Scandi
navians, and there is scarcely one
farm that lacks its quota of dairy
cows. The Lynden creamery
was established in 1902 and has
had an almost uninterrupted
growth ever since. H. Elenbaas,
the manager states that the cur
rent year's product will amount
to over a million pounds of butter,
and this in spite of the fact that
there are eight creameries and
two large condenseries within a
radius of fifteen miles of Lynden.
One of the competing creameries
is in Lynden itself.
The Lynden creamery is con
ducted on strictly co-operative
principles, with the result that
the patrons have saved to them
selves over $25,000 this year
above what the average indi
vidually owned creamery or cen
tralizer is paying for the cream
it secures. The Lynden cream
ery, nearly always able to pay its
patrons two or three cents more
for their butterfat than could be
secured in the larger cities, such
as Seattle and others. At pres
ent butterfat is being quoted in
Seattle at 33c, while the Lynden
creamery has been paying more
than 36c for six or seven weeks
past.
Where the interest in dairying
is, from force of circumstances,
so intense as in the Nooksack
valley, it naturally follows that
the quality of the average herd
of cows is high. In this section
the Holsteins and Jerseys are
everywhere to be seen, with
numbers of Guernseys and Ayr
shires proving a pleasant con
trast here and there. The com
mon scrub finds no favor among
the dairymen in the Nooksack
valley.—Washington Farmer

Salmon Gives Up Its Dead
Word was received yesterday
from Grangeville that the body
of Bosco Kane, who was drowned
in Salmon river near Whitebird
last Christmas, had been found
that morning near the Lyons
ferry below Whitebird. The body
was in a bad state of preservation
and could only be identified by
the clothing and dental work on
the teeth. The body was taken
to Whitebird and buried soon
afterward.
It will be remembered that the
Kane brothers were drowned in
the Salmon last Christmas while
they and a companion were ford
ing the stream on their way
home. One of the Kane boys,
who was riding a mule, got into
deep water and his brother went
to his rescue and both were
drowned. As the bodies did not
rise to the surface a watch has
been kept on the stream for the
past several months and at vari
ous times reports have been made
that the bodies had been seen
going down the stream. The
carcass of the mule was recently
located near Riparia but nothing
has been seen of the remains of
the drowned men until the dis
covery yesterday. Now that one
of the bodies has been recovered
the other may be located, while
on the other hand it may have
gone down the stream weeks ago
and found its way into the Col
umbia and thence to the sea.
Received a Fine Hereford
August Schroeder, the well
known cattle breeder, received a
fine purebred registered Here
ford bull calf the first of the
week from a big Hereford breed
er in Kentucky and took it out to
his farm east of the city. The
calf was only five months old but
tipped the beam at 810 pounds
and cost its owner the neat sum
of $550. The animal comes from
one of the finest herds of Here
ford cattle in the Uuited States
and was selected for Mr. Schroe
der by Mr. Kinzer, who is recog
nized as an authority on beef cat
tle in this country.
Mr. Schroeder already owns
some of the best stock in the
Hereford class in the northwest
and has added to his herd by
frequent purchases from the
leading eastern breeders, and the
addition of the animal just re
ceived gives him some of the
choicest blood lines in the entire
country. That his stock is bred
in the purple is shown by the
fact that he has twice won the
prize for the carload lot of fat
steers exhibited at the North
west Livestock show at Lewiston
against the strongest kind of
competition.
Besides selling stock for breed
ing purposes, Mr. Schroeder
finds there is better money in
raising purebreds for market for
the reason that they always com
mand better prices for beef than
the poorer quality animals, to
say nothing of the pleasure de
rived from growing the best to
be grown in the beef type of cat
tle.
We predict that within a few
years the Schroeder herd of
Herefords will be known all over
the Pacific slope as containing
the finest to be had in the breed
ing line, both for utility and
show ring purposes.
Barney Tacke went to Spokane
the first of the week to visit his
daughter, who is in the hospital
in that city, and the George Har
man family at Hillyard.
Mrs. C. E. Fredericks retnmed
home last night from Spokane
where she has been for the past
couple of months recovering from
a serious operation. She is much
improved in health and will soon
be entirely recovered.

UPHOLDING YOUR
HOME TOWN
Trading at Home and Building
Up Home Industries is to
Your Own Best Interests—
Town and Country are One
Your town lot or your country
home—what is its true value—in
dollars and cents?
If a man came to you and said,
"This is just the lot I want," or,
"This farm of yours just suits
me. What do you want for it?"
And you said $500 for the lot,"
or "$10,000 for the farm," on
what would you base the figures?
How would you arrive at the par
ticular sums?
Of course the value of the land
next to yours would have a great
deal to do with it—but wouldn't
you figure as the biggest asset
the prosperity of your home town
—the fact that it is growing and
is goiug to keep on growing and
that in five years the value of
your property will be much
greater than that of today—if
your home town continues to
grow and prosper?
You bet you would—you would
play up that point to beat the
band; you would paint the beauti
ful picture of how Cottonwood is
prospering and will continue to
prosper. In other words, you
capitalize the prosperity of your
home town.
If that man bought your farm
home or your city lot, he would
be paying more than the actual
value —the intrinsic value of the
land itself. He would be in
vesting in the future of Cotton
wood and if Cottonwood does not
continue to prosper, that man
would be sure to lose some mon
ey. So you can see that the true
value of your property, whether
it be a ranch or town property,
depends upon the progressiveness
of your home town and that if
you want your property to in
crease in value, it is up to you to
help Cottonwood grow instead of
trying to push it back, and the
only way you can help your home
town is to encourage more busi
ness and social activity by par
ticipating in it yourself—by
spending your money where it
will do the most good—for by
helping your own town you are
bound to increase the value of
your real holdings, whether it be
in town or country.
We must keep our money at
home. We can't afford to send
any of it away for when we do it
is gone forever. Our merchants
are just as progressive as the
merchants in any other town.
The goods they have for our
selection are just as up-to-date
and full of value as the goods
found in other towns. And we
will find that their prices are
just about the same as in other
towns, or perhaps cheaper, qual
ity considered. Our merchants
are here to stay and when you
buy merchandise of whatsoever
kind from them you can see
just what you are getting and
you can take the article or arti
cles home with you—there is no
freight to pay and you are taking
no chances of getting something
you do not want. By patroniz
ing them we are helping our
selves as well as the merchants
and we are helping property to
increase in value.
The way to recognize the value
of your property is on the pro
gressiveness of the people of the
the town and community—your
self included. Take stock at
once and see if the above state
ments are not correct.

Kidnapping at Grangeville
Quite an exciting kidnapping
occurred last Friday at Grange
ville when Mrs. S. J. Warren ap
peared in the city in an auto,
picked up her child as it was
playing in the yard of Fred Kars
ten, fled into the country for sev
eral miles in the car and then
changed to horseback and went
on to Stites, leaving the next
morning with the child for Spo
kane. At Arrow Junction an
officer served a summons on the
lady requiring the appearance of
herself and the child in court and
they were taken on to Lewiston
where the little boy was placed
in the Children's Home until such
time as the case can be heard in
court. Warren who is brakeman
on the local railway, is estranged
from his wife and divorce pro
ceedings are now pending in the
superior court at Spokane. The
father had the boy at the Kars
ten home in Grangeville where
the mother went to secure him,
hoping to keep the child in her
possession until such time as the
court decided with which parent
the child should be left.

Printer Takes to Farming
George Rustemeyer, who has
been the efficient foreman of
this office for the past several
years, has decided to turn his
attention to the job of making
two stalks of grain to grow
where only one grew before and
will leave after this week to take
up his new occupation on the
Moynagh ranch northeast of
Greencreek, to which place his
family moved 1 yesterday. We
sincerely hope he may find life
among the grain fields entirely
to his liking and that providence
may smile down upon him and
cause his crops to yield a hun
dred fold. His place in the
Chronicle office will be filled by
J. G. Ruggles, of Peck, an ex
perienced newspaper man, who
was formerly employed for sev
eral years at Moscow and later
held down a homestead on the
Joseph.

Was An Expensive Winter
Charlie Albin left yesterday
for his home on Rapid river above
Pollock after spending several
days in the city visiting with old
friends. Charlie said the white
fish are biting fine now in the
Little Salmon and he wanted to
get home and see if one wouldn't
jump out on the bank at him and
give him an excuse to hit it with
a club in self defense, even if
April is a closed month of fishing.
Speaking of stock conditions up
the river, Charlie said the Holt &
Rhoades firm came through the
winter in fine shape and with
very little loss, but it was princi
pally due to the large amount of
feed they had on hand. The past
few winters have been very light
and little feeding was required
and as a consequence they had
almost four years' hay crop on
hand, which put them through
the winter in fine shape. How
ever, they figure the hay fed and
the cost of feeding would easily
total $5,500, which is rather an
expensive winter even fora large
firm.
Family Was Provided For
Ira Smith, district game war

he traveled with a party from
Kooskia who had been sent in to
look after Mrs. Martin and an
eleven months old child who were
reported in destitute condition?.
However, such did not prove to
be a fact, it seems the husband
in place of deserting the family
as was reported, had at the urg
ent suggestion of his wife, left
earlier in the season for Northern
Idaho to work during the winter
and help things along, leaving
ample supplies of food and fuel
for his family and making ar
rangements on his way out for
parties to go in later on and
bring out the family. The wo
man and child were brought out
by the party and withstood the
seventy-five mile trip fine. —Free
