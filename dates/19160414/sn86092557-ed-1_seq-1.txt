TYPICAL mi WEATHER
Prophets Say That Rest Of
Month Will Be
Nice.
Ileal April showers interspersed ?,
With bits uf sunshine throughout the :
day and accompanied by u healthy j
voting gale of wind gave Fairmont to- i
jay a sample of inoBt every kind of ?
weathor on the schedule. Tlie day I
dawned bright and clear with every j
indieation thai another balmy spring j
day. such. as yesterday, would be rcr-1
ordod. The temperature yesterday was
only 77 at the warmest time but the
gentle breeze and languorous sunshine
gave everyone a touch of tho deadly
"Spring Fever." It Is reported that
manv persons have not yet recovered
from the effects of this very contagi
ous malady.
Willie tlie monkey that died Inst j
nlglit at the lire department was being |
taken to Ills last resting place this
morning the Heavens literally wept and
tin- streets and sewers were tilled with
the sudden torrent. Many a poor un
fortunate pedestrian who had proba
bly never heard of the monkey, receiv
ed a liberal soaking because lie aroso
too early and was deceived by tlie
signs at sunrise, thus leaving his rain
coat and umbrella at home.
Even the most doubting ot tlie doubt
fill have at last been convinced that
Spring is indeed here at last. Palm
Beach suits for the men and glad Ens
tar raiment of the ladles is seen on
every corner and ill every clothing
storo window.- Adventurous persona
who have traveled in far countries,
even to the neighboring states, report
thai, the one unfalllblc sign of Spring,
a large picture of a gout wltli magnifi
cent whiskers, is to be seen decorat
ing bill boards, with the magic words.
"Hock on Draught." benenth the pic

All the weather prophets who get
paid lor their work, and even those
who do not. have lit last unanimously
agreed thai the remainder of this
month will lie comparatively warm and
pleasant. Snow is rarely seen in this
section after the loth of April although
many heavy rains are to be expected.
The country roads, however, are fast
drvliig up and another week similar
m'lhis one will sec Iho deep mud dried
in nearly every section and automo
