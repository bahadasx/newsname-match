14.) About forty mounted men be
lieved to lie Villa soldiers of General
Tarango's command attacked last
rtlght an automobile supply train and
were driven off after a short fight.
There were no American casualties.
One Villa bandit was killed.
General Pershing moved bis camp
south yesterday, penetrating far into
Villa territorj where lie found num
erous de facto government detach
ments under General Garza who gave
the Americans a friendly greeting and
co-operation. Aeroplanes were first to
reach this new front. General Persh
ing traveled liore in an automobile
train of supply trucks, which made a
record-breaking trip.
The light, which occurred about 3
o'clock, was several miles in the rear
of the automobiles carrying General
Pershing and his escort, it lasted
about twenty minutes. When the ban
dits who tried to capture one truck,
came up, the Americans poured in
five volleys which ended the fight com
pletely. There were two attacks, the
first a slight one and direct) d against
forward truck. The last attack was
a rush against the rear trucks during
which bullets flew against the automo
biles. The American soldiers thought i
they hit some of the bandits.
Harry Gosnear, of the autotruck
train, a resident of Philadelphia, got
a bullet through his hat.

Chihuahua for the announced pur
pose of taking up the pursuit of Villa,
in the event of trouble with the de
faeto government General Gomez

line of American communications at
Casas Grandes.
There are uncomfirmed reports that
th<» battle In Parral in which a de
tachment of 140 American cavalry
men were attacked by citizens was
more desperate than indicated in the
