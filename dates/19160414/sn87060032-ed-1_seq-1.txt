already well and favorably known
to many of our citizens as a law

liberal and progressive views;
whose success has been rather
phcnominal with the voters of

eminently fair judicial mind.
Judge Sampson arrived here

Appeals for the Seventh Appel-

their eyes, as in no other way
can the contestants show they

Saturday, August 5, 191G, to
which he aspires, and to which
honor he asks promotion; which
office is within keeping with his
services as Circuit Judge of his
district, which he now holds, and
to which he was elected without
opposition even in the final elec
tion, which i3 rather remarkable
in Eastern Kentucky politics.
Judge Sampson says he feels
confident of success of his candi
dacy, and presents good reasons
therefor. It would be gratifying
to him to receive the support of
the voters of Letcher county,
which he holds in high esteem,
and where he is not altogether a
stranger. He will make an ac
tive canvass and promises to ad
dress the citizens and voters at
the proper time.
Here is, in brief, his record as
an official: County Judge of
Knox county one term; Circuit
Judge two terms; present in
cumbent; both times without op
position. Judge Sampson is a native of
Knox county; just about forty
years of age with a wealth of
physical strength and mentality,
which promises a long, useful
and honorable life; his father,
Joseph Sampson, having attain
ed a high place in longevity;
ninety-two years of age, having
voted seventy-one years; and

party has voted that ticket with

a lively interest.
It is inferred that the son has

is one whose surplus is equal to its capital
stock. "The Financier", a paper published in New
York, gets from the Government the names of all
banks whose surplus is equal to its capital, and pub
lishes them as HONOR ROLL BANKS. Thus if a
bank has a capital of $15,000.00 and a surplus of
$15,000.00 it is an "Honor Roll Bank" just the same
as a bank with a MILLION DOLLARS of CAPITAL

Kentucky: but he practiced law
successfully for ten years before
he entered the political domain,
and only then at the earnest so
licitation of his friends and
associates. His decisions as Cir

as having a marked degree of
fairness, and according to the
number of cases he has tried he
has seldom been reversed by the
higher courts.
