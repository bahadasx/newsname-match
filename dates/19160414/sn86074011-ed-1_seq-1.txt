Senate, Thursday, April 6th, Hon.
Tames K. Vardaman said:
. mr t -i t
iur. aruamaii. -ir. i resmnu, i
think the telegrams and letters that
are sent to members of Congress are
either from motives ef patriotism or
pelf. I have no objection whatever
to a member of the National Guard
of my state 'or any other states giv
ing me his honest opinion as to the
value of the National Guard to the
general plan of our army. I do not
object to anybody giving me an idea
or a fact, but -I do not care to hear
from any one who has a pe
cuniary interest in the matter of leg
islation: I have received a telegram
such as the Senator from Missouri
(Mr. Reed) has just read.
Now, if this great army is to b
organized I have no objection to, a
volunteer force jit all. I have no oh
jection to these camps m the sum
mer time for the purpose of training
men in the use of arms, and teach
ing them the lessons of war. I think.
however, the toilers of the country
can ill afford to bear the burdens of
taxation incident thereto at this
time. Personally, I luid hoped that
all of this great plan, the organiza
tion of the army and the building of
a navy, might be postponed until
alter tne war in r.urope is over, so
as to permit the American people to
surve- the situation and organize an
army and build a navv to meet all
the exigencies and the necessities of
the future. And I think that prob
ably would have been done but for
the energetic efforts on the part of
those who are largely interested in
tne proms derived irom the manu
facture of munitions of war. Mani
festly this congress is hot going to
take the course which I would die
tate or prescribe had 1 the power,
but on the contrary, I am afraid it
is going to undertake to lay the foun
dation of 'a great system to build a
house, as it were, when the flames
are leaping heavenword and the
storm is raging furiously about us
That such a structure, whose f oun-
dation is laid under such circum
stances, will meet the demands of
the future, if we shall do our duty
as a Christian nation and the civi
lized peoples of the earth shall show
themselves capable of self-govern
ment, I have my serious doubts.
My especial objection to section
56 is rather local in its nature. I

the people of the State from which I
come, my purpose in calling atten
tion to the objectionable provisions
of section 56 are purely patriotic.
My only desire in the matter was to
serve the people of Mississippi and
America. But, notwithstanding my
motive, I notice in the Record that
my warnings and suggestions have
been made the subject of ridicule by
a distinguished member of this body.
I want to say, Mr. President, that
there is no argument in epithets, no
reason in ridicule; and satire in the
discussion of a serious question is
. the refuge of the intellectual bandit.
In the consideration of this great
question the calmest, most serious
consideration should be given to
every provision of this bill. When
I said that under the terms of sec-
. tion 56 there might be organized in
the Mate of Mississippi a camp to
which the negroes of that State
would be invited, I did not say that
"that . would be done, God forbid
that there - should ever come to the

When it is suggested that such a
thing is impossible, that the labor

camps, I want to say in reply that

a
! proposition were made to them they
would flock to it like carrion crows
around a carcass. There could be
a camp organized in tne otate 01
.. r m. s
Mississippi, by advertising it for 60
days of 2.",000; and the senators from
the other sections of this Republic
do not know what that means to
the people of Mississippi.' O, I am
n saying this in order to generate
race prejudice or to advertise our
own unfortunate conditions; not at
all. I would to God that conditions
were different, that the peril might
e removed from our midst.
It was stated upon the floor of the
Senate yesterday :
Suppose a lot of darkies went
into Hinds county, to a so-called
Plattsburg drill, as a volun
tary force of some sort, and,
with arms in their hands, began
to be disciplined, so that in the
opinion of the white people of
the State they became a source
of menace to white civilization,
what . would happen to those
volunteer darkies? Echo an
swers "what?"
Of course, I know what would
happen, and what I know would
happen, is the verv thing that I do
not want to happen. No man knows
the difficulties in handling the af
fairs of a Southern State when the
two races conflict, who has not serv
ed in the capacity tn which I served
for four years as governor. You
Senators from states where you have
not that problem at all read in your
newspapers nearly every morning
accounts of some unfortunate crime
that has been committed in South
Carolina, Georgia, Mississippi, Ala
bama, Texas; and what is the re-
suit.' iooditi". w hat is the eneci
of mobbing upon those who mob?
I care not what the provication may
be; I do not care what crime may
lead to the mobbing: the white man
who participates in it, though he
does it to protect his home, to pre
serve the peace and purity of his
wife and daughters that man who
violates the law when he takes it
in his own hands suffers a moral de-j
terioration from which he will never
recover; and if that thing is persist
ed in very long, it will destroy the
verv civilization which we of the
South are trying to conserve. There
is no doubt about that.
ow, it, lor '-political reasons or
any other reasons, with an utter dis
regard of the real interests not only
of the Southern people but all of the
American people because what
ever injures the South, hurts the en
tire Republic any president should
he order moblization of negro troops
in Mississippi or any other Southern
State, keeptthem there for 30 days,
clothe and equip them, and then
send them back with all the airs
they have acqnired in i0 days of
drill, only one who understands the
I A 1 1
ltle generally would kow what would
follow.
But the distinguished Senator in
timated that the negroes have no
money to attend the camp. Under
the terms of this bill, the United
States government furnishes the
money to pay for transportation and
general equipment. Every negro
would take it as a very delightful
summer outing, and if an etlort
should be made to bring them to the
service of the United States as a part
of the army, I apprehend it would
not be the least trouble to organize
as large an army as the government
would be willing to pay for.
Mr. President, I would much rath
er taKe my chances without - any
preparation whatever to meet a for
eign foe, relying upon the individ
ual white citizen and the patriotic
spirit of the men of America to de
fend the flag and repel any foreign
invasion, than to submit to the en
actment of a law of this character,
which exposes the people of 'the
South to a peril as far reaching as
the adoption of section 56. I shall
therefore vote to strike that section
from the bill.

The question at issue between the
owners of railways and trainmen
does not concern only the parties to
the contention, bet the public also in
the fultest sense of the term. There ir
a question of equity involved thai
i
comprehends every element of the
transportation utilities, the owners
and the trainmen as well on the one
side, and the consuming and prcf
ducing public on the other. This
questiou is so comprehensive in its
scope as to overshadow any wage
dispute between owners ami opera
tors short ot organized oppression
on the part of railway managements
and that does not appear. The pub
lic will not be in-sympathy with a
strike actuated bv 'motives to ob
tain a higher wage for service than
is earned by skilled workmen in
other trades or employments. Es
pecially is this true when it is known
that increased expense in operating
raHroads causes increased cost of
transportation and results in higher
cost of living a thing in which peo
ple of all conditions are vitally in
terested. To indicate how such a
strike is regarded by the country and
all its interests, a resolution passed
by the business people of Aberdeen
is published below; and also an ed
ltorial from the Greenwood News,
showing that the sentiment embod
led in the Aberdeen resolution is
widespread over the country:
Aberdeen, Miss., April 6, 1916.
The buisiness men of Aberdeen
following the lead of other business
organizations of the country, have
adopted the' following resolutions
with regard to the great railroad
striKe with wnicn the country is
threatened:
Whereas, certain grave differences
seem to be pending between the
railroads of the United States and
their train service employees, which
if not adjusted, threaten very seri
ous interruption of railroad trpns
portation, and
Whereas, a railroad strike of all
the unions or organizations of the
train service employees . would ha
nothing less than a national calam
a. . m
ity and would be sure to result m
great suffering to our people as well
as entail incalculable loss far greater
than would be sustained by either
party to the controversy, be it there
fore
Resolved, that it is the earnest
hope and request of "the business
men of Aberdeen, Miss., that the
parties to the controversy may reach
an agreement through negotiations;
and that, failing in this, both parties
submit their differences to arbitra
tion, composed of impartial busi
ness men, and that an adjustment
of all differences may be settledbe
tween them without imposing
the dire results of a disastrous rail
road strike ot such immense pro
portions upon the public.
The Greenwood News says:
ii ' . .
Uonsidenng that the country is
just recovering from a condition of
depression, and that the average bus
iness man considers himself lucky if
he can net a bare living ' out of his
business, is it reasonable to suppose
that the public will consent now to
further raises in railroad rates? -Is it
not. reasonable to suppose that the
public is going to be overwhelmingly
against any strike or tie-up of the
railroads by the engineers; conduc
tors, flagmen and firemen at such a
time? How can these men win with
the public against them? The News
would be glad to see this class of
railway employees get all they can
by any reasonable means, but a strike
at such a time, would be foolhardy
and disastrous to those who partici
pate; the fact is strikes and lock-outs
are out of date anyway. Better and
more friendly ways have been found
to settle wage disputes. These
brotherhoods and unions would bet
ter a thousand times try negotiation
and arbitration. For, if they strike
at this time, they are going to wreck
themselves. They will suffer along
with the public. There was once a
Sampson who slew people with the
jaw-bone of an ass, and afterwards
pulled down a house upon himself.
The railroad employees should be
ware of leaders who threaten to est
them into sucH a strike at a time
like this. Cuch leaders may do great
harm with the law-bone, but will
pull the house down cn them in the
end, if they precipitate a strike."
