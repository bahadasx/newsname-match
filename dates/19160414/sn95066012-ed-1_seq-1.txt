First Chief Sends Regrets, Urging
That Amerians Withdraw
U.S. TO SEND REINFORCEMENTS
American Troops Return the Fire and
. , Kill Scores of , Disgruntled
, , , Mexican.
,,( Washington, April 14. American
troops In Mexico have had their battle
with the natives, at the moment Gen
Carranza Is urging their withdrawal.
On Wednesday night, while Gen. Car
ranza's note was on its way to Wash
ington, troopers of the 7th cavalry un
der Maj. Tompkins were fired upon in
Parrel, a Villa stronghold in western
Chihuahua; were pursued to the sub
urbs, while the Carranza garrison
took a doubtful part in the affray, and
were attacked again during the night.
Complete information regarding the
losses to the American troops or to the
Mexicans had not reached Washington
last night. Secretary Baker informed
President Wilson that a brief dispatch
to the war department said that, ac
cording to unofficial reports, one Amerl
can cavalryman was killed and that
troopers used a machine gun against
the Mexicans.
" Last night the situation of the iso
lated detachment j was the cause of
some anxiety. . Outnumbered and pos
sibly beleaguered in a neighborhood
notoriously an ti-American, and how
far from reinforcements no one at
waBlUuHlon KUUWB, iu xroupers may
be In grave danger which only the
, thin and uncertain lines of commu
nication from the advance base of the
American army in Mexico can tell.
The story oC the attack upon theni is
told In the following dispatches to the
Carranza embassy at Washington, the
first from Foreign Minister Aguilar
and the second from Gen. Carranza
himself:
'Tlease confer with the honorable
Secretary Lansing and inform him
that today at 1 p. m., a column of 150
American soldiers entered the city
of Parral. The mayor of the city,
Jose de la LuzHerrera, immediately
called the attention of the commander
of this column to the inconvenience
of his entering the city, his soldiers
immediately withdrawing, but when
they were leaving the people protested
end the mayor and military com
manders tried to control them with
their appeals in order to prevent fric
tion, but owing to the imprudence of
a civilian who fired a shot, a genoral
disorder followed in which one Amer
ican soldier was killed and several
civilians were wounded by shots from
American soldiers. Military com
mandcrs succeeded In checking the
mob at Maturana, to avoid them from
following American troops, forming
a cordon of constitutionalist soldiers
"In this connection, the Mexican
government warned the government
of the United States from beginning
that it would be unwise for American
troops to pass through cities, due to
the Impossibility to avoid friction be
tween them and the people and our
forces at an unexpected moment
The American government, to that
effect, agreed to give the necessary in
structlons to Us troops to have them
abstain from occupying any towns,
The Mexican government deplores the
occurrenco, but It was beyond its ef
forts to prevent It and insists with
the American government on the
necessity of withdrawing Its troops
from our soil In order not to give room
for the alteration of the good and cor
dial relations which both countries are
obliged to preserve."
A dispatch from Gen. Carranza him
self follows: "After message sent you
by Secretary tor Foreign Affairs Agui
lar, the secretary of war recolved a
message from Gen. Gutierrez daled at
Chihuahua informing him that it had
been impossible for military com
manders to check the mob against
American troops who entered Parral,
and that this evening (April 12) the
tight had continued between our poo
plo and the American forces, tint
many deaths had occurred on bo'.h
sides. Gen Obregon has already given
orders to prevent continuance of bat
. tie, but the excitement Is so gieut
among the people that I fall to know
whether the struggle can bo stopped.

advise him that the occurrence is due
to the unwise action of the American
commander In having entered Pnrral

CARRANZA BACK TO CAPITAL
Preparing to Set Up His Government
Again in Mexico City.
Washington, April 13. General
Carranza is preparing immediately to
set up the capital of his dofacto Gov
ernment in Mexico city, Official re
ports to the State Department tonight
said ho expected to leave Queretaro,
the temporary capital, today, and
should arrive in Mexico City tomor
row.
The decision to restore the seat of
government to the ancient capital at
this time is believed here to have been
due largely to Carranza's desire to Im,
press the people of Mexico with thtv
view that he actually is head of the
nation and to quiet unrest caused by
the presence of United States troops
on Mexican soil. It was suggested
that the trouble yesterday at Parral,
where American soldiers and Mexican
civilians exchanged shots, probably
hastened the action.

TURKS MAKING A STAND
sians from Trebizond.
Petrograd, April 14 By means of a
series of counter-attacks carried out
with great energy, the Turks in Ar
menia are straining to the utmost to
defend the important city of Baiburt
at the chief junction of the roads be
tween Erzerum and Trezibond. Since
in addition to the good roads to Slvas
and Mamakhatun there are several
trails from Baiburt through the Pon
tus range to the Black sea coast, the
occupation of Baiburt establishes close
connection between the armies moving
along the coast to Trebizond and tho
central Russian army aiming at Krz
ingan.
The new line of attack upon the
Black sea port of Trebizond from the
south, which the occupation of this
junction would offer, would, it is bo
lievod, cause the immediate retire
ment of the Turkish forces defending
the approaches to Trebizond and lead
to the capitulation of Turkey's most
important Black sea port. Baiburt
itself Is an important provisioning cen
ter and formerly served tho Turkish
forces at Erzerum as a base for am
munition supplies.
In the Armenian theatro the Rus
sian troops are steadily advancing in
a souhtwesterly direction toward the
upper Tigris, where, Russian officials
say the Turks have been less success
ful than elsewhere in checking tho
progress of the Russians.

BRIEF LULL COMES
111 GUEST: BATTLE
; of
German Effort to Attack Foiled by
French Fire Curtain
HEAVY GUN FIRE ONLY ACTIVITY
French Discourage German Attack on
Hill 304 With Use of Liquid
Fire.
Berlin, April 14 An attack by the
French on the West Dank of the Meuse
was repulsed today. Otherwise, tho
war otllce announced there was no
change on the Verdun front.
London, April 13. German activity
on the Verdun front has slackened to a
marked degree. Calm prevailed in the
whole region last night, according to
the French official bulletin. Today the
German artillery was bombarding the
French plsitions west of the Meuse,
especially Hill 304 and the lines from
Le Mort Homme to Cumleres. On ttie
east of the river, says Paris, the guns
were less active. No infantry action
took place anywhere.
The only evidence or serious opera
tions by the Crown Prince during the
twenty-four hours was before Hill 304,
where, according to Paris, preparations
were made to assault, but the attack
was prevented by French fire.
According to a Paris theory, as told
by a late dispatch from the French
capital, the Germans are bombarding
the Verdun lines with a view to an
early return to the practice of deliver
ing a series of short, sharp blows at
different points of the line, aiming to
disorganize the system of reserve by
diversity in the points attacked and
gradually wear down the defenses,
thus preparing a general assault. It is
expected in Paris that the Germans
will attack the west bank positions
again as soon as a favorable opportuni
ty presents.
SELLING DEAD LETTERS.
One Portoffice Custon: ' hat Teaches
Moral Lesson.
Twice a your in Washington they
hold a curious auction. It is colled the
dead letter sale, but in reality it Is the
sale of packages that hnvo been sent
to the dead letter ollic-e Localise of de
ficient postage or wrong direct inn.
After these packages liiivo been held
for a certain length of time, in order to
give Renders or owners an opportunity
to claim them, they me sold nt public
auction.
It is often a st rouge and pathetic col
lection. Most of the articles are cheap
enough, although valuable things are
not locking. But who rim estimate the
intrinsic value of some of those lost
gifts the time and sacrifice nnd love
they respect? How ninny lives were
robbed of a happiness that rightfully
belonged to them because of the send
er's carelessness or Ignorance!
Is there not a parable lurking some
where about this strange auction
How many lives ore there today that
bold tho possibility of gilts for other
lives, vet through carelessness or Igno

theinsolves and others and are care

SICK "PEACE OF
J!
Will Make National Honor His
Campaign Issue
SUPPORTS A PROTECTIVE TARIFF
Appeals to the Soul of the Nation Not
to Allow a National Record of
Shame.
Oyster Bay, L. I., April 13. Colonel
Theodore Roosevelt, after the four days
of comparative quiet which marked his
trip to Massachusetts and Connecticut,
jirmped into the pre-oonventlon cam
paign w'lth'redoubled vigor today. He
was asked to comment on Tho New
York Tribune's editorial pledging the
support of that Republican newspaper,
and he dictated the following state
ment:
Of course I deeply appreciate what
The Tribune says or me, but 1 appre
ciate infinitely more what It says in
advocacy of the things for which 1
stand.
The final sentence of the editorial
says: 'We are choosing which way
the country shall go In the era that
Is now opening Just as our fathers
chose the nation's path in the days of
I860."
This sentence should be in the mind
of every man who at Chicago next
June takes part iu formulating the
platform and naming the candidate.
The men at Chicago should act in the
spirit of the men who stood behind
Abraham Lincoln.
From time to time it has recently
been announced that the fight against
Mr. Wilson Is to be waged only, or
almost only, cn the tariff. Such nn
appeal would be au appeal to the
belly and not to the soul of the Amer
ican nation.
By all means provide for the things
of the body, but only on . condition
that we treat the body as the servant
of the soul.
I believe heartily in a protective
tarl..'.
I'nless we return to a protective tar
iff, preferably administered through
a commission or experts, wo. shall
lace widespread economic disaster at
the end of this war.
But this is not the great Issue on
which the fight Is to be made if the
highest service Is to be rendered the
American people.
The issue Is that the American peo
ple must find its own soul. National
honor is a spiritual thing that cannot
be haggled over In terms of dollars.
We must stand not only for America
first but for America first and last
and all the time and without any sec
ond. Our loyalty must be to the whole
United States. The East must stand
for the safeguarding of the Pacific
Coast against every foe. The West
must stand for the safeguarding of the
Atlantic Coast against every foe. East
and West and North and South alike
must hold the life of every man and
the honor of every woman on the most
remote ranch on the Mexican border
as a sacred trust to be guaranteed by
the might of our united notion.
We cun be true to mankind at largo
only if we are true to ourselves. If
we are false to ourselves we shall bo
false to anyone else. have
lofty Ideal to serve, a great mission
to accomplish for the cause of free
dom and of genuine democracy and of
justice and fair dealing throughout
the world.
If we are weak and slothful and
absorbed in mere money getting and
vapid excitement we can neither serve
these causes nor any others. We must
stand for national discipline and for pre
poroilncss, military, social, and in
dUBt rial. In order to help the soul of
thin nation.
We stand for peace, but only for the
peace that comes as a right to tho
lust man armed and not for the pence
which tho coward purchnsos by abject
submission to wrong. The peace of
cowardice leads in the end to war
after a record of shame.

HIE TAXES PAID BY
FORESTS OH
BY WIS
European Flan favored by the
State Forester
CHANCE IN THIS COUNTRY
A. F. Hawes, State Forester In Ben
nington and Urges Municipal
, Forestry.
State Forester A. F. Hawes was in
Bennington Thursday . in the interest
of his department. There Is an in-'
creasing interest in forestry ' In the ;
state and' there will bo more 'orest 1
tree seedlings planted this year than j
ever before. Owing, however, to the in- J
creased planting at the state nursery
there are more young trees available
than ever before. '
Mr. Hawes would like to see more '
interest in municipal forestry in Ver
mont and thinks that Bennington coun
ty towns have an exceptional oppor
tunity to make themselves prosperous
through this work.
In Germany and France there are
many towns where the people do not
have to pay taxes because forests
owned by the towns furnish incomo
enough to meet all expenses.
The start Is made by buying forest
land just alter it is cut over and tho
alue is small. The land is then
planted to valuable forest trees of
arious kinds and in the course of a
few years under forestry methods the
forest furnishes a gooii income each
year
Only the trees that arc ready to cut
are taken out and young ones put in.
The cost of caring for the property is
almost nothing.
Perhaps the best chance for munici
pal forestry is in Manchester where
the Rich lumber company is cutting
over a big area. This land after being
cut off will not furnish another crop
for fully 50 years if left to Itself.
If Manchester could buy the land at
a femall price and plant, it at once to
quick growing trees lu from 25 to 40
years the land would probably give
each year an income that would do
away with all taxes iu the town and
give money for all needed improve
ment.'. Here in Bennington Bald Mountain
furnishes a good field. It would, of
course, be impossible to buy it all at
once, but if it could be acquired la
small tracts as It conies Into the
market the next generation of Ben
nington people would not have to fret
about the annual visit of the listers.
That the business can be made suc
cessful has been proved over and over
again in France and Germany, and
with lumber and pulp prices going up
the business gets better from year to
year. It Is certainly an interesting
subject to consider.
The city cf Rutland which owns the
watershed in Mendon where the city
water conies from has decided to
plant the watershed to forest trees
this spring.
Mr. Hawes went back to Burlington
this morning but will visit Bennington.
again some time next month. . .,
