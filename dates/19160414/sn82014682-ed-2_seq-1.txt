in part: "I was called on in Mon

straighten out the emergency hospital
tangle by voting against, the : ordin
ance putting the hospital and physi
cian, under the authority of the she
riff, and leaving them under the Juris
diction of the health and sanitation
committee and the city and county

ergency physician's work is a matter
of health and sanitation. It would be
very unwise to put the hospital under
the control of the city and county phy

red tape. More properly. It Is a do-

head ' so that her jury rudder coul1
steer her.
, The fingers of both the steamer'a

f4asoclatd Press Service by Federal Wireieaa.
WASHINGTON, D C. April 14. After a prolonged cabinet
meeting today the developments definitely forecast a demand upon Ger
many for remedial action in the case of the sinking of tlv British clun
nel steamer Sussex and other vessels declared to have been sunk in
violation both of international law and or German assurances.
The president and his cabinet held a long session today, it being
announced afterwards that a communication to Germany will probably'
go forward within 48 hours. '
: One reason for the delay is that affidavits have just arrived at New
.York from Europe which are considered an essential part of the evi
dence that the merchant vessels were unlawfully sunk, and state depart
ment advisors believe that the case woujd be incomplete without them.
These affidavits contend that not only the Sussex but other merchant
vessels were sunk in violation of Germany's promises
; With this statement of fact, sent on to Germany, there will be a de
mand that Germany show evidence of her good faith in making good
her assurances that no unarmed merchant vessel, not attempting to flee,
would be attacked without warning, and that every precaution would
be taken to safeguard the lives of passengers and crew.. Germany will
also be reminded of her assurances that she would disavow any act in
contravention of these promises, and would punish any submarine com
mander who violated corresponding orders.
Nothing in the nature of a time limit ' is attached to the note
now contemplated. - ; ' ' - ' A
