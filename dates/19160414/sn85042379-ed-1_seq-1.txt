VOLUME XII.
GLASGOW, VALLEY COUNTY, MONTANA, APRIL 14, 1916.
NUMBER 60
KILLED BETWEEN
FREIGHT CARS
Brakeman W. A. Brown Killed
While Switching at Oswego.
DEATH INSTANTANEOUS
Had Only Been in Employ of Great
Northern a Week and Was Mak
ing His First Trip
Caught between two box cars as he
was making a "cut" while doing some
switching on the east local at Os
wego, Brakeman W. A. Brown came
to an untimely death last Thursday
night.
Only a week before, Brown had
started work for the Great Northern
at Havre, and it was on his first trip
out of Glasgow that he met his death.
There were no eye-witnesses to the
accident, except Brakeman Marriott
who was on top of some box cars,
and who saw Brown's lantern fall.
When he observed this he gave a sig
nal to stop and ran to where Brown
was found pinned between two cars.
He then gave the engineer the signal
to "slack ahead" and Brown's body
fell to the ground. With the assist
ance of Engineer Tenesch and Fire
man Peters, Brown was put in a box
car and Conductor Jeffers ran to the
depot to get medical assistance but
as there was no doctor at Oswego,
they took Brown to Wolf Point.
Death must have been almost in
stantaneous, as he never uttered a
sound when the accident occurred, and
when other members of the crew
reached him he was breathing his
last. At Wolf Point the body was
put on No. 3 and brought to Glasgow.
As it was Brown's first trip out of
here, and being a stranger in the city,
very little was known, or could be
learned of him. That he was an ex
perienced brakeman was evidenced by
his ability while performing his dut
ies.
Coroner Peterson held an inquest
Saturday afternoon, and Conductor
James Jeffers, Engineer Tenesch,
Fireman Peters and Brakeman Marri
ott and Wright related what. they
knew about the accident.
After hearing the testimony the
jury composed of F. W. Wilson, C.
L. Purdy, J. R. Hilt, J. F. Longtin,
Marvin Browning and J. B. Durkee
returned the following verdict:
"We, the jury duly, empaneled to in
quire into the death of W. A. Brown
find that the body viewed, was that
of W. A, Brown, and that he came to
his death while in the employ of the
Great Northern, in the performance
of his duties, on the passing track
at Oswego, Montana, at 11:30 p. m.
on the 6th day of April, 1916."
TO VALIDATE HOMESTEADS
Senator Myers has introduced the
following bill in the Senate to vali
date certain homestead entries:
"That all pending homestead en
tries made in gocyi faith prior to
January 1, 1916, under the provisions
of the enlarged homestead laws, and
all rights to enter land under said
laws, based on settlement made there
on in good faith before said date, and
while the land was unsurveyed, by
persons, who, before making such en
larged homestead entry, had acquired
title to land under the homestead laws
and therefore were not. qualified to
make an enlarged homestead entry,
or such settlement, be, and the same
are hereby validated, if in all other
respects regular, in all cases where
the original homestead entry was for
less than 160 acres of land, provided
that no settlement claim shall be vali
dated hereby /where ad^frse claim
for the land has been initiated before
the passage of this act."
ANOTHER "NUT" FOR PUCK
Sheriff C. W. Powell may yet have
to turn his jail into a storehouse for
the stray "nuts" in the county. For
the past two weeks "Red" Adams has
been an honored guest at that insti
tution, but he will take his leave soon
for Warm Springs for an indefinite
visit at the Hospital for the Insane,
but the Hotel de Powell will still have
one inmate with a cracked dome.
Tuesday,-Hans Carlson was brought
in from Opheim by H. H. Beebe and
turned over to the Sheriff for safe
keeping. He was picked up on the
streets of Opheim a few days before
and appeared to be mentally derang
ed. He startled the citizens of the
peaceful hamlet in the north country
by parading up and down the streets
singing at the top of his voice.
When he was locked up in one of
the private rooms w ith steel walls
and barB on the door in Puck Powell's
"Weary Willie Hotel," he undoubtedly
imagined that he would make a fine
September Morn, and started to dis
robe regardless of the other prisoners
who were highly shocked by his ac
tion. Efforts by the officers to make
him keep his clothes on were unavail
ing and now he doesn't even wear a
smile. A blanket was given to him
but he tore this into shreds. He en
tertains the inmates with barefoot
dances and people can hear him sing
two blocks away.
Fred Williams, official custodian of
the courthouse has noticed an unusu
al number of squirrels around the
grounds the last few days and it has
been keeping him busy chasing them
away.
FINE GARAGE AT BAYLOR
Manager B. E. Thompson of the
Prairie Belle Garage at Baylor was
in the city Tuesday to get a load
of supplies and machinery for his new
place of business.
Mr. Thompson is the agent for the
Overland car at Baylor and he ex
pects to have the prosperous farmers
and ranchers in that pat of the county
riding on the cushioned seats before
the season is over. He will also
handle supplies and accessories of all
kinds as well as oils and greases.
The new garage is one of the larg
est in the North Country and will
be thoroughly equipped. M v. Thomp
son is an experienced garage man
capable to handle the business.
BASEBALL PRACTICE
BEGINS SUNDAY
Candidates for 191fi Team to Report
at Ball Park.
Sunday, April 16th has been the
day set by Manager Fred Fischl of
the Glasgow base ball team /or the
first practice of the season. The
warm rays of Old Sol the past week
have dried the grounds so that they
will be in fine shape by Sunday, and
a big list of candidates for positions
on this year's team will probably be
on hand to get their wings in shape
and adjusting their batting sights.
The first game of the season will
be on May 14th with Nashua at the
local park, and Manager Fischl is de
termined that Nashua will not carry
away the bacon as they did at the
start of the season last year.. Every
member of last year's team and any
others who have played base ball
should be out at the ball park Sun
day.
No doubt there are any number of
Ty Cobbs and Benny Kauffs in the
city won could make the team with a
little practice, and it is to get a line
on these men that the management
desires to see a good crowd turn out
for the first practice.
KILLED BY TRAIN
Ambrose Hagel, was instantly kill
ed last Thursday morning about five
miles west of Chinook, when struck
by the engine of Train No. 4.
Just before reaching the Yantic
railway bridge, the engineer saw what
he took to be a white horse on the
track directly in front of the engine.
He endeavored to stop but the dis
tance was too. short and the engine
Hit the moving object.
. When the train stopped it was
found that they had hit a man, who
was walking ahead of the engine,
stark naked. The body was badly
cut and mangled and death muBt have
been instantaneous.
In the morning an examination of
the track where the accident occurred
revealed the fact that Hagel had re
moved his clothes while walking on
the right of way and articles of wear
ing apparel were scattered along the
track for half a mile.
Hagel was last seen at Havre the
night before the accident and .had
acted peculiarly. He had probably
walked down from Havre and in his
demented condition did not heed
the oncoming train.

GRADE CROSSING
MAY BESECURED
Officials of G. N. Presented With
Petitions and Facts.
ACTION WILL BE TAKEN
Enormous Increase in Company's
Business HerÂ« and Growth of City
Principal Reasons.
Thursday evening a committee from
the Glasgow Commercial Club and
the City Council met officials of the
Great Northern Railway Company
and presented petitions asking them
for a surface crossing through the
right-of-way at some convenient place
in the business section of the city.
The officials were traveling East
Number 28, the party consisting
Vice President Gruber, General
on
of
Manager Emerson, E. C. Leverich,
General Superintendent Montana Di
vision, and Division Superintendent
J. M. Doyle. They arrived in Glas
gow at 7:45 P. M. and the train was
held here fbr half an hour while the
matter was laid before the officials.
The Commercial Club was represent
ed by President J. W. Wedum, Secre
tary S. C. Moore and R. M. Lewis.
The City Council by W. W. Hurd and
the citizens by Dr. M. D. Hoyt.
Dr. Hoyt acted as spokesman -for
the Committee and presented the four
petitions which had been drafted and
signed by the people of the city, and
stated in a very clear manner the ne
cessity for the crossing. He showed
the present inconvenient method by
which it is necessary for residents to
cross from either side of the city to
the other, mentioned the rapid growth
and development during the past two
years, and stated the outlook for fu
jture growth of Glasgow; pointed to
even greater strides than have been
made in the past.
Vice President Gruber and the other
officials were very courteous to the
commitee and entered into a thorough
discussion of the situation from the
Railway's standpoint as well as from
that of the city. The heavy ship
ping and enormous amount of switch
ing necessary in the local yards was
gone into and the many details con-,
sidered which will be met with in
making any further changes here.
The officials expressed an inclination
favoring the request of the city, and
Mr. Gruber stated that as soon as
returned to S,
Paul from the Pacific coast the peti
tions would be given attention . He
further stated the Great Northern
will inform the Commercial Club of
the decision of the Company at the
earliest possible moment.
"SAFETY FIRST" SUNDAY
Sunday, April 30th, will be "Safety
first Sunday" in Montana. Govei
nor S. V. Stewart in a letter to Chair
man A. E. Spriggs of the industrial
accident board, commended thÂ» sug
gestion advanced by two Great Falls
parties and urges the pastors of the
state to give it their favorable con
sideration. The Governor writer;
"The plan evolved by Mr. Krejci
and Mr. Price of Great Falls, relative
to the observance of "Safety First
Sunday" in Montana, which you pre
sented to me, is an entirely praise-1
worthy one.
"Time was, and not so very far in
the past, when "little or no thought
was given to the question of pro
taction of human life from the dan
gers that threatened in the hazardous
lines of man's endeavor. Few safety
appliances were installed, and the re
suiting loss of life was looked upon
as one of the unavoidable penalties of
the industry. But an enlightened
public sentiment has wrought a
change in this respect, and today the
'Safety First' slogan is one of the
most insistent and appealing in our
daily industrial life.
"Men have come to realize that the,
sacrifice of life that has characterized
our undertakings in the past was in
large part preventable and therefore
well-nigh criminal. The employer
has come to see that it iB economy
of the highest order to throw every
possible safeguard around his em
ployes. The worker, too, has been
brought to a realization that his own
negligence may easily render value
less every appliance installed for his
protection, and that it is his solemn
duty to observe every possible pre-1
caution.
"The movement that is growing so
rapidly has everything to commend it
and it seems to me that the plan
requesting the ministers of the state;
to observe Sunday, the thirtieth day
of April, as 'Safety First Sunday'
should result in untold good. The
ministers will be able' to teach thous
ands of our people and to so impress
them with the importance of the idea
that a wonderful impetus will be giv
en to the plan that has for its base
the conservation of our immeasurably
greatest resourceâhuman life.
"I unhesitatingly commend the idea
to the favorable consideration of the
pastors of the various churches of the
rtate."
SPELLING CONTEST TONIGHT
A spelling contest will be held at
the high school auditorium on Friday
evening, April 14th, beginning at 8

the Glasgow City Schools. The win
ner in this contest will represent the
on Friday, May 19th: An admission
of 10 cents will be charged so as to
secure funds with which to purchase
prizes for the local winners. The
statement is frequently made that
students in the common schools can
not spell as well as students in form
er years and generations. Persons
who entertain this idea are particu
larly requested to come to hear the
contest.

WINTER WHEAT CROP LESS
The total production of 950,000,000
bushels of winter wheat was forecast
recently by the department of agri
culture, basing its estimate on the
condition April 1st, and the assump
tion of average abandonment of ac
reage and average increases on crop
to harvest.
The condition of winter wheat on
April 1st, was 78.3 per cent of a
normal against 88.8 last year, 95.6
in 1914 and 87.3 the average for the
last ten years. There was a decrease
in condition from to April 1st of 14
points compared with an average de
cline of 03.5 points between those
dates in the last ten years.
The average condition of rye on
April 1st was 87.8 per cent of a nor
mal against 89.5 on April 1st last
year, 91.3 in 1914 and 89.9 the aver
age for the last ten years.
The department of agriculture in a
statement analyzing the report aaid:
"The . small production forecast is
due partly to reduction of about 11
per cent from, the acreage of the pre
ceding year and to a low condition
of growth, namely 78.3 per cent of
normal, which is lower than the con
dition on April 1st in any year since
1904; it is 10 per cent poorer than
the 10 year average on April 1.
"The cause for the low condition
was a wet, cold fall, causing poor
seed beds and poor start for winter
ing. Much of the crop was sown late,
partly from necessity of the season
and partly to avoid the Hessian fly.
"The Hessian fly is reported pre
sent and active in many sections of
the southern part of the belt.
"Climatic conditions were harder
on late than on early seeded wheat,
Considerable grain on lowlands was
destroyed by flooding and largely
from freezing and thawing out which
was greater than usual. Southern
portions of hio, Indiana, Illinois and
portions of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois and
fected. The relatively best sections
of,are the most eastern and far west
era htalcs."
HOMESEEKERS
COMING FAST
Northern Montana Swarming
With New Settlers.
MANY ON RESERVATION
Almost 300 Filings Made at Land Of
fice Since April First. Many
More Coming.
Homeseekers are comini* into Mon
tana in greater numbers than ever be
fore in the history of the state and
Northern Montana is getting a big
percentage of them. Not a train
passes through Glasgow, but what
it carries a large number of land
seekers from the states east of here,
with some point along the line of the
Great Northern as their destination.
,Glasgow is getting its share of the
newcomers and from ten to twenty
have been arriving in the city every
day.
The establishment of homeseekers
and colonists rates on the railroads
coming into the state is responsible
to a great degree for the present
heavy tourist travel. Drawn west
by the wonderful showing made by
Montana in the California expositions
in 1915 and the fact that land here is
much cheaper than in the Mississippi
River Valley states, while the pro
duction per acre is better, substantial
farmers in the Dakotas, Minnesota,
Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Wisconsin,
Michigan, Nebraska, Missouri and
Kansas are coming into the state. One
of the local land men stated that
the majority of those who were com
ing out now were from the Dakotas,
Minnesota and Canada. The number
of homeseekers from the Dominion
has been exceedingly large. Many
of those who are taking up Uncle
Sam's land were former citizens of
this country, but went into Canada
before the war and took up land there.
Since the war started, however, con
ditions have been anything but good
up there and there has been a steady
stream of setlers hitting the trail
back to the good old U. S. A.
One interesting thing about the new
settlers is that the majority of them
are under thirty years of age, and
many of them own good homes in the
states from where they came and
have substantial bank accounts. They
re just the kind of men Montana
needs to break the virgin prairie soil
and harvest the crops that have be
come famous the world over.
The land men have been greatly
handicapped in their work of filing
prospective settlers on claims, as it
has been almost impossible to get
any distance into the country. The
swollen creeks make it impossible to
use an automobile and in some cases,
parties, of homesteaders have been
taken out to look at land in wagons.
Some idea of the rapidity with
which the vacant land in this part
of the state is being taken up may
bÃ« gained from the report of the U.
S. Land Office in this city, which
shows that during the first 13 days
in April there were 292 filings. Over
seventy-five per cent of these Were
made on the Fort Peck Indian Reser
vation.
If the present migration keeps up
Northern Montana's population will
be greatly increased during the year
1916, and thousands of acres will be
broken and put into crop by the new
settlers. '
CUMMINS THE FAVORITC
With the primary election to select
delegates to the Republican National
Convention, only two weeks off, it
is becoming more and more evident
that Senator Cummins of Iowa will
be the choice of Montana Republicans.
In every section of the state reports
<re coming in showing that he is re
garded as the logical man to -re-unite
the Republican forces in the coming
National Convention.
Attorney John A. Shelton of Butte,
who has been making an active cam
paign throughout the state reports
that wherever he has visited the senti
ment of the Republican leaders and
also of the rank and file of the party
is overhwelming in favor of the Iowa
Senator. The same reports come to
the head-quarters at Helena, presid
ed over by Mr. Harvey. While there
is no question but Cummins' will eÃ r
ry the primaries, his supporters are
exceedingly anxious to send a dele
gation that shall represent that senti-;,
ment thoroughly.
It would be regarded as poor poli
tics after carrying the primaries "for
Mr. Cummins' to send men who are
not known to be his earnest and actual
supporters to represent that senti
ment. For this reason all Republi
cans who favor the nominating of
Senator Cummins are being urged to
select as candidate for delegate when
they vote only such men as are known
o be straight out Cummins' support
ers. While no slate has been pre
pared it is generally known that Buch
men as John A. Shelton of Butte, O.
M. Harvey of Livingston, O. F. God
dard of Billings, and State Chairman
Selway of Dillon, and several others
are for Cummins first, last and all
time. There are others whose posi
tion is in doubt. By the end of next
week, however, the lines will prob
ably be drawn so that Cummins' forc
ces will be able to unite on a com
plete list of delegates who will re
present the choice and wishes of the
Republicans of Montana.
MISSION MEETINGS
Rev. Wm. J. Cartwright of Port
land, regon, has been holding mission

Rev. Cartwright will preach a spe
cial sermon on Friday evening, April
14th on "The Attitude of the Catholic

PREPARING FOR A
HOME TALENT PLAY
Local Thespians to Appear in Fine
Comedy Soon.
The Ladies of the Congregational
church are arranging to give an en
tertainment during the week follow
ing Easter entitled "Ye Village Skewl
of Long Ago". It will under the dir
ection of Mrs. Memminger-Keith as
sisted by some of the best musical
talent in the city. The picturesque
costume of ante-bellum days, old
fashion dances and songs will add
mirth and spice to the play. Mrs.
Memminger-Keith has staged some of
the most successful home talen op
erettas and plays given in this city,
so that it is safe to predict a treat
for the Glasgow people. The partici
pants are busily practicing and each
part is developing individually good.
An exact date will be announced later.
