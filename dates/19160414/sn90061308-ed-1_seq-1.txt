Mexican Head Wants United States to
Quit the Chase After Villa
in Mexico.
Special to The Daily Times. .
WASHINGTON, April 13 (11:15 a.
m.) Carranza, president of Mexico,
in a note to his embassy at Washing
ton this morning, makes the demand
that the United States abandon their
chase of the bandit Villa and to re
move the troops from Mexico.
LET THE AMERICAN
CITIZEN STAND UP
When the world is at peace and we
have nothing more serious on our
minds in this country than minding
our own business, it doesn't bother us
much when those who make a living
out of politics choose sides and play
that game.
We don't mind it much if they call
themselves Reds and Blues, or Demo
crats and Republicans. Nor do we
care what tags or labels or uniforms
they wear.
Just now, however, it is different.
The country has been facing a crisis
ever since the European war broke
out... Our country is facing a crisis
now, and our chief executive has more
of our troubles on his mirict than any
President since the martyred Lincoln.
He is doing everything in his power
to preserve peace with honor. '
Had he been a weak man and easily
driven, we would have had an army
of occupation in Mexico wlien war was
declared in Europe.; For powerful
American' interests' went the limit in
trying to force an invasion of Mexico
in orfljr. tn ijiake proWble their con
cessions,, .
-. He is not representing a political
party. He is representing the Ameri
can people. And now is no time for
partisan play. The people are in no
humor now to sit in the bleachers and
watch the piffling antics of political
clowns, be they Democrats or Repub
licans. This is no time for any citizen to be
anything less than a patriotic Ameri
can, whose patriotism is not limited
to any smaller territory than the en
tire United States.
Let the American citizen stand up,
and the peanut partisan go away back
and sit down. News-Herald (Rep.)

Hubert came up from Neosno, Wed

MEXICAN TOWN IS
. , SACKED BY LARGE
BAND UNDER VILLA
Thousands of Dollars' Worth of Prop
erty Destroyed and Everything
of Value Taken
El Paso, Tex., April 12. A band
of Villistas numbering several hun
dred, and possibly a thousand, have
sacked Sierra Mojada, fiv.e miles
across the Coahuila line and eighty
miles east of Jiminez, destroying
many thousands of dollars' worth of
American property and looting the
town of everything of value.
This news, which may prove to be
of the highest importance, as it is be
lieved possible Villa himself was
among the raiders, was received here
today by the representative of one of
the largest American mining con
cerns in Mexico and is accepted by
him as authentic. The bandits made
their attack on the town on April 5.
They came from Escalon, a junction
point "on the Mexican National rail
road, eighty miles southeast of Jimi
nez and about an equal distance
southwest of Sierra Mojada. On their
way to the latter place they sacked
the small town of Corrillo.
The belief that Villa himself may
be directing the operations of the ban
dits is suported by a report received
today from Ojinaga Station that Col
onel Riojas, the commander there,
had. information thta Villa had dou
bled in his tracks and was 200 miles
southwest of that town.

Note Regarding Attacks- on Six" Ves
sels is Forwarded to Washington
by Gerard
Washington, Apriri2. Admission
by Germany that her submarines re
cently attacked three merchant ships
carrying American citizens and that
one of them torpedoed a vessel in the
vicinity of the point where the chan
nel steamer Sussex was damaged by
an explosion has simplified the task
of the state department in preparing
for the next step of the United tSates
in the issue over submarine warfare.
Following the receipt in cabled
press dispatches of the latest Germany
note, it became known that the United
States would continue to compile in
formation indicating that German sub
marines are operating in violation of
the rules of international law and that
very soon a communication designed
to be the final word of the American
government on the subject would go
forward to Berlin.
The state department virtually has
completed the collection of facts re
lating to all attacks on merchant
ships since the Lusitania.

FRISCO HAS MADE GOOD
SHOWING IN 8 MONTHS
Returns -for Remaining Four Months
Should Help Care for Contingent
Charges
The earnings of the St. Louis and
San Francisao railroad for some
months have shown satisfactory' in
creases. There was a handsome gain
in the gross earning for February, the,
returns being $551,000 more than for
the corresponding month of the pre
vious year. There was a substantial
expansion in operating expenses, but
a gain of $141,000 in operating in
come was shown nevertheless. For
the eight months of the fiscal year, or
up to the end of February, the gross
earnings reflected an increase of near
ly $2,500,000 while $1,180,000 of this
amount was saved for the operating
income.
The annual fixed charges, including
rentals, under the plan, amount to $9,
158,190. It is understood that more
than this amount was earned during
the first returns for the four months
of the current year. This would go
a long way toward taking care, of the
contingent charges. After they are
met there is only $7,000,000 of 8 per
cent preferred stock, in which divi
dends at that rate must be paid an
nually, ahead of the common . stock,
the dividend on which would amount
to only $420,000 a year. Springfield

SEES NEW CHRISTIAN ERA
War Will End Mohammedanism in
Europe, Dr. C. B. Ussher Says
Kansas City, April 11. -Mohammedanism
in Europe will end with the
war, according to Dr. Clarence 4B.
Ussher, formerly a physician here and
since 1898 a Congregational medical
missionary in Eastern Turkey. Doc
tor Ussher arrived in Kansas City to
day. He will remain here for ten

Armenian and Syrian Relief. He is
staying at the home of Dr. Alfred T.
Schauffler, 3903 Warwick Boulevard.
He is a graduate of the Kansas City
Medical College.
"Europe will be clean of Moham
medanism when the war is over," he
said. "Then Christianity will be giv
en one of its greatest chances in his
tory to expand. That will not be
long, I am confident. The conflict
cannot last longer..' than five more
months .
"The Central Powers are in great
financial difficulties. Financially they
cannot possibly hold out longer than
five more months." ,
Doctor Ussher has a letter written
by a diplomat in Geneva telling of the
financial condition of the Austro-Ger-man
countries .
While here Doctor Ussher will
speak at many of the Congregational
churches in an effort;. to obtain money
and perfect a relief committee.
"The Armenians are starving by the
hundreds of thousands," he asserted.
"More than 310000 in Armenia and
IPorci'i ilrtiifl naarl linln Tn irvncno
'and adjacent cities million more
are starving." ;
' Doctor Ussher spoke with feeling
Twhen asked about the Armenian mas
; sacres. He was in Van when the
j Turks raided the city on April 15 and
t massacred fifty-five thousand Chris
tians. He escaped with the Russians
when they retreated before the Turk
ish and German troops at Van last
August.
