Since the last meeting, held in the
JPte Bank, Tuesday. March at.,
it has been quite a busy week for al1
the boys. Very inergetically they set
to work, and now they have a nice
room, nicely papored and well light
ed. In the near future they will in
stall a shower bath system, druggets,
tables and other conveniences. All
these will be paid for with funds tak
en from. the Club's treasury. But
the boys have decided that perhaps
it would be possible to get necessary
chairs from other sources.
remaps mose who Know o: tne

that that is the predominating garnet
think 'that chairs would be a mans
of additional torture rather than a
luxury.
The boys admit this is true as to
those coming directly from the game
but thev also bee that the citizens of
V Earlington remember that not all the
boys indulge In this popular game,
so chairs become a great necessity to
these. Therefore they ask that any
one having an old chair, not greatly
needed, will inform some of the boys
of the fact and they will greatly ap
preciate the favor.
Tuesday evening, March 28, they
will hold their next business meeting.
Affairs ot great importance will be
considered at this meeting.
The club is always desirous of
procuring new members and anyone
desiring to become a member should
gfve .his name" to some of the charter
members.
He will then, if approved, be ad
mitted by a vo.te of the club.

The lateit American church device
for "raising the wind" is what a re
lfgious paper describes- as "some
collection box." The inventor hails
from Oklahoma. If a member of
the congregation drops in a 25-cent
piece or a coin of larger value, there
is silence. If it is a 10-cent piece a
bell rings, a 5 cent piece sounds a
whistle, and a cent fires a, blank cart
ridge. If any one pretends to be
asleep when the box passes, it awak

Some Hike"
Last Saturday morning tho
"Iddy Club" cbaporoned by Miss
Geneva HufTakcr, left town at
nine o'clock for a "Goose and
Fox" chase. The geese consisted
of the following girls: Misses
Thelma Wesl, Dorothy Onrbltt,
Cathrine Blondin, Fannie Fu
gate and Mae Lillian Fish.
About one half hour later tho
Foxes left on their trail. These
girls were the members of the
"Pi Delta Sigma" Club : Misses
Lena Uavis, Gladys Whitford,
Gladys Walker, Hattie Polk
Crenshaw, Jane Foard, Anna
West, Aileen Fox. They were
chaperoned by Miss Freida Hel
ler and their club advisor Miss
Elizabeth Long.
The Foxes trailed the Geese by
paper that had been thrown along
the way. After about a five
mile walk the geese were caught
in the park of tho beautiful
'Lich Mary" where a "bunky"
feast was enjoyed by all,

success that the girls tell us that
they are going to try it again.
"Lots of girls are not acrobats
As is plainly to bo seen.
But, at crossing pipes like cats
Believe me, they are keen."
New School Laws
The new school laws are, as far
as we can learn, about as follows :
To re-codify the common school
lawe.
To exempt one dog to the head
of each family from (taxation,
To appropriated $5,000 annual
ly for two years for the Illiter
acy Commission.
.To take the school census only
every two years.
To compel all graded schools
to carry a four- year high school
course or pay tuition,
To amend the State Text Book
adoption law, so that not more
than three books can be changed
in any one yoar.
IT IS BAD
Whetl you walk along the
street aud. see the gutters strewn
with refuse, it looks bad.
- When you see empthy bottles
decorating the dark corners, that
looks bad and suspicious.
When you see papers blowing
arouni over town it indicates
that people are thoughtless aud
careless. It is bad.
When you see broken glass
around underfoot it is pure neg
ligence, and is both bad and
dangerous.
When ycu see kitchen garbage
dumped into the back yard or
tossed over the fence, it looks
bad and smells worse.
When you see vacant property
littered with debris of every na
ture, it, too, looks bad !s offeni
sive to the mind as well as to the
eye.
When you see a back yard
littered with the accumulations
of mouths aud of yoarp, it looks
worse than bad.
Wheu you see a front yard
down ut the heels and going to
seed, you wonder but, then,
we'll let you finish the eentenpe.
Just how bad are we, any way?
