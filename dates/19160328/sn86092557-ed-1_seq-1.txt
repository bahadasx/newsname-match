Lack of Transport Facilities
Reaches a Critical
Stage.
(By Associated Press)
EL PASO, Texas, March 28.?The
pursuit of Villa may be hampered if
not actually halted unless Mexican rail
roads are made available as the main
line of communication for the Ameri
can array in Mexico. Military men ex
press that view today after studying
dispatches from the front that Villa
was still in full flight south and meet
ing with little if any opposition.
The American forces are more than
200 miles below the border. Every
mile the Mexican bandits advance into
the interior increases the difficulties
of maintaining the already attenuated
line of American communication.
There is rhuch pessimism in army
circles over the prospect of capturing
Villa and it felt that unless he is cor-'
nered within a week the bandits will
have outrun the pursuers and many
months hay pass before he^and his.
band can be ferreted outv of hiding
places in the mountains.
Dispatches from the advance fly
ing column pressing Villa \closely,
make no mention of having come in
contact with any of .the bandit's men.
WASHINGTON, March 28.?A mem
orandum to General Carranza pressing
for an immediate reply to its request
for permission to use Mexican rail
roads in supplying American troops
in pursuit of Villa was prepared today
at the State department. It will be
forwarded to Queretaro probably late
today and be delivered by special rep
resentative Kodgers to General Car
ranza and General Obregon.
The memorandum points out that
the problem of supplying troops now
more than 200 .milerf.from the border
is a'pressing one and need not be de*
layed for the protocol covering the!
goneral subject. General darranza's
suggestions as to modification'and ad
dition to the draft of the protocol are
staill under consideration in the State
department As considerable time may
bo required to bring the agreement]
into final form .the American govern
ment may. urge that, the immediate J
use of the Mexican Northwestern line
be considered separately and at once.

show, that the bank had lost no'money
by the transactions charged in the in

proved. Shaw said' that" all the direc
tors and officers of both the? bank and
the grocery company had knowledge
of the transactions and were fully
as responsible as Linn or Race. Attor
ney Shaw spoke but a short time and
denied many of the allegations that

leged to have been paid out on the

aiding and abetting Linn in these
transactions with'the intent to injiire
both the Smlth-llace Grocery Co.,
and the Citizens Dollar Savings Bank.
Attorney Morris, who Is assisting
Mr. Haggerty in.the case, briefly re
viewed the testimony that the state
would offer to support the indictment'
Ho Bald that the state in tl?elr evi

Brilliant Idea
But It Wont Work
(By Associated Press)
LONDON, March 28?The sight of
birds pecking mortar suggested to an
Englishman a bright idea ot demolish
ing the Krupp works. The idea was
this:
Obtain a flock of cormorants and
train them by putting their food in
horizontal and vertical lines against
a wall. They will thus associate
these lines with then- food. Take the
birds to Essen and liberate them.
They would then attack the great
chimneys at Krupp's works with such
vigor as to destroy them.
The Inventor sent his plan to tho
War Inventions board, a member of
which told the story at the Royal
Institution meeting this week. "I
hope," remarked the speaker, "that
I Bhall ? not get Into trouble for re
vealing important secrets of use to
th4 enemy".
