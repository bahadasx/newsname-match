JUDGE WRIGHT REM-
Refuses to Dissolve the Injunction

Judge Wright, who listened last
Friday to the arguments and evi
dence in the O'Brien-Martin injunc
tion case, h4s rendered a decision in
favor.of O'Brien, denying the'motion
of Martin asking for a dissolution of
the injunction. Mr. Martin has been
trying to get possession of the
store room oil Second street occupied
by Mr. O'Brien's pool tyUl, claiming
that Mr. O'jBrien had forfeited the
lease by falling to meet its require
ments. Mr. O'Brien secured an in
junction enjoining Martin froan in
terferring with hi^ possesSion pl the
room until theV expiration of the
^case some 'tfniie in February,
Martin &rogbt -to have tfils irijunc
tion dissolved, but Wrljfht rfeinses,
to dissolve it. Martin h^s leas

less some agreement is reached by
O'Brien and Martin it appears that
it will be Impossible for Mr. Martin
