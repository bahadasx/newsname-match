The British and Germans have been
fighting fiercely in the region of St.
Eloi. just south of Ypres. and the Brit
ish, through the explosion of a big
mine and by infantry charges, have
captured or destroyed a considerable
portion of the German trenches.
The British infantry stormed land

along a front of 600 yards, London of
ficially announced, and Berlin admits
that German trenches in this region
"were blown up to an extent of, 100.
yards, and that "casualties were
caused among the company occupy
ing the position."
Again the bombardment has become
intense to the northwest, and north
east of Verdun, and considerable ac
tivity by the big guns also has been
shown in the Woerre region, south
east of the fortress. The time seem
ingly is not ripe, however, for an in
fantry attack, and the men on bcth
sides have lain idle in their trenches,
awaiting the moment for attack and
counter attack.
The Germans, after a period of com
parative quiet, have again begun
shelling Bethincourt, Le Mort Homme
and Cumieres, west of the Meuse, and
are keeping up with increasing volume
their bombardment of the French po
sitions in the region of Vaux ahd
Douaumont, which, have been stum
bling blocks for many weeks, in their
attempts to gain ground northwest of
Verdun.
French sheHs are falling on the Ger
man positions in , the 'Argonne and
northeast of the St. Mihiel salient.
The Germans are obstinately resist
ing the Russian attacks between
Dvin.sk and Vilna, but the Russians
have captured two lines of their
trenches to the northwest of Postavy.
Twenty bombs have been dropped Dy
German airmen on thA town of Dvisk.
In the Black Sea region the Rus

the Turks. In the operations between

LONDON, March 27. The British

bassy indicates that no American lives
were lost . on the Sussex, but three
Americans were injured dangerously.
Joshua Dickinson Armitage of-New

hospital at Dover. Professor Mark
Baldwin and his wife, who were re
ported lost, were saved. Their daugh
ter, Elizabeth, was badly injured and
is also in a hospital at Dover. -'.
The delay in gathering full details
is due to the fact that Boulogne is in
the war zone, cut off from telegraphic
communication for civilians.
A)l recitals of the disaster give great
praise to a young 'French cavalry
officer who walked up and down tho
deck of the Sussex encouraging the
passengers with assurances that -the
vessel would not sink. He induced
many persons to remain aboard in
stead of jumping into the sea. The
survivors generally agree that the
Americans showed great self posses

own chances in favor of women and
children. '

One long dispatch from-Ambassador

As made public, the dispatch, which
evidently sent before the safety of all

that the testimony of five American
survivors agreed that the explosion
occurred "under the bow of the Sus
sex," that there were six lifeboats,
with a carrying capacity of about 25

drowned when two or three of the
boats capsized soon after striking the

formation received by Lloyd's. The
members of the crew were 'taken

The Central News says that the

President Wilson Awaits
With Deep Concern Con
clusive Details of Sinking
of Sussex and of Steamer
Englishman as Well
Republican A. P. Leased Wire
WASHINGTON, March 27. With all
evidence indicating that the British
channel steamer Sussex carrying Amer
ican citizens was the victim of a tor
pedo, it was said authoritatively here
tonight that if a German submarine
made the attack, the imperial govern
ment would disavow the act, punish
the submarine commander, offer rep
aration and satisfaction to the United
States. Thus it seemed tonight that
the issue might narrow down to the
quesion of whether the United States
would be willing to accept such a dec
laration from the Berlin government.
President Wilson is awaiting with
deep concern, the receipt of conclusive
evidence not only in regard to the Sus
sex, aboard which several Americans
narrowly escaped death, but as to the
sinking of the British steamship Eng
lishman. One American life is said in
the" last official reports to have been
lost when the Englishman went down.
Already, it was intimated at the state
department, the United States has in
its possession information sufficient to
warrant the making of an inquiry of
the German government as to whether
any of its submarines fired a torpedo
at the Sussex or the Englishman.
The president holds the opinion that
all, the details available should be at
hand before definite action of any kind
is taken. He described the situation to
a caller during the day as being grave.
but said no decisive step would be tak
en pending the receipt of additional
facts.
It is known that the president is
seriously considering going before con
gress and laying the entire question of
submarine warfare before that body.
Certainly he will communicate the
situation fully to congress before tak
ing any definite steps which might lead
to the severance of diplomatic relations.
All phases of the situation probably will
be discussed at the cabinet meeting to
morrow. Official expression of the attitude f
the administration was avoided today
but high officials made no attempt to
minimize the situation which will con
front the United States if it is estab
lished conclusively that a German sub
marine sank the Sussex, an unarmed
peaceful passenger-carrying vessel, in
violation of the rights of humanity, the
principle of international law and the
solemn assurances regarding the con
duct of the submarine warfare which
have been given to the United States
by the Central European powers.
President Wilson was in constant
communication with Secretary Lansing
during the day and all reports received
from consular and diplomatic represen
tatives were sent to the White House
as soon as they were received.
Count von Bernstorff, the German
ambassador, who, it was said with
authority during the day, was chiefly
responsible for the retirement of Grand
Admiral von Tirpitz, has been out of
town for several days, but is expected
to return to the capital tomorrow. He
probably will communicate with Secre
tary Lansing soon after his arrival.
The discovery of a number of frag
ments of metal aboard the Sussex, in
cluding a large piece of bronze found
by a French naval officer, has been re
ported by 'Ambassador Sharpe at Paris.
The naval officer, according to the state
department dispatches, says the piece
of bronze is a part of a torpedo.
It is x realized that testimony of a
French naval officer would be regarded
as biased by the German authorities
and the department is relying upon an
expert examination of the other pieces
of metal to establish whether they were
parts of a German torpedo.
So far as is known, the state depart
ment has not yet heard that anyone
aboard the ship saw the periscope of a
submarine near the Sussex, but state
ments to the effect that the wake of a
torpedo was seen are understood to
have been made. The state depart
ment, however, withheld much of the
Information received from diplomatic
and consular representatives on the
ground that it was confidential

Republican A. P. Leased Wire
WASHINGTON, March 27. Failure
of senate republicans to take any ac
tion at a conference today on the Mex
ican situation left the administration
unhampered in dealing with the prob
lem. The conference was called to consider
steps to force the dispatch of additional
troops to the border for patrol duty.
In the face of official advices denying
alarming reports, however, and of Gen
eral Funston's apparent confidence that
he has enough men for any present
emergency the republicans adjourned
with some of their leaders agreeing to
do nothing but support the administra
tion's plans at this time.
Official advices confirmed press dis
patches telling of the physical diffi
culties, encountered by General Fun
ston in keeping a 200 mile supply line
in operation without the use of rail
roads. While there is no shortage of
food or other supplies for the troops at
the front, cavalry mounts already are
on short rations.
Steps to meet the situation have been
taken by Secretary Baker, as there is
no indication of an early agreement on
the proposed protocol providing for the
use or Mexican lines by American
troops. Mr.. Baker issued this state-)
ment late today:
"All information the department has
from the border shows cpnditions to be
quiet and the excitement of the last
few days somewhat allayed. We have
no dispatches indicating actual conflict
between American" soldiers and any
forces of any kind in Mexico.
"The expedition is, of course, moving
forward, and so lengthening the line of
communication. For that reason. Gen
eral Funston has requested and the de
partment has purchased two auto
truck equipments, comprising 54 cars

Funston tells us that additional aero
planes will be of service, both in re
connaissance work and in carrying
messages from the advance column to
the base at Columbus. Of the aero
planes already there, two have been
destroyed. Others have need of re
placing parts, but two of them are in
actual continuous service. The depart
ment is now negotiating for the pur

The first aero squadron of the United
States army in a week's service with
Brigadier General John J. Pershing's
expedition in Mexico has surmounted
flying problems more difficult than
most of those encountered by Euro
pean aviators.
The work has been done thus far
without a really serious accident. One
of the senior aviators said today that
only in the Alps are the European fly
ers likely to encounter conditions paral
lelling those under which the American
aviators now are working. The Mexi
can flying service has been a succes
sion of exciting incidents, each one met
successfully by the quick wit of the
aviators.
"Never," said this aviator, "have we
had any flying as difficult as we have
done here. We are under a handicap of
an altitude of about 5,200 feet when
we rise. Some of the mountains we
have tried to get over are approximate

more tonight on the railroad situation.
Dispatches from Washington and San
Antonio showing that the United
States military authorities were be
coming increasingly impatient for the
completion of arrangements with
General Carranza for the use of the
Mexican roada. confirmed . the belief
held here for the last week that the
railroad problem was the present crux
of the situation. .
Army officers here privately admit
that the question ot getting adequate
supplies to the forces at the front is
growing serious. They say that the
present system of motor transporta
tion across the Chihuahua desert has
proved entirely inadequate and as
General Pershing's columns push far
ther into the desolation of western
Chihuahua the supply problem Is
growing acute. The advance corps of
the expeditionary force now Is well
over 250 miles from the frontier and
every day presumably adds many
miles to the thin line of communica
tions. The sand storms which sweep
across the Chihuahua wastes are sim
ilar to the simoons which have again
and again wiped out caravans on the
Sahara desert. Mormon colonists and
American ranchmen agree that noth
ing but a railroad can cope with na
ture in this dreary region. Even if
wagon roads were constructed their
life would be brief.
y There has been some speculation
here as to the manner in which foods
would be shipped from FJ Paso. It
has been suggested that to avoid
contact with the Carranza troops in
Juarez, supplies would be taken In
motor trucks to a point on the Mex

south of the boundary and there load

Republican A. P. Leased Wire
SAN ANTONIO, Texas. March 27.
Francisco Villa's escape from the region
about Namiquipa followed his victory
over part of the Mexican government
troops and was unopposed by other de
tachments of the de facto government
forces, according to unofficial but cred
ible reports reaching here today.
The cordon of troops that the Mexi
can authorities announced should have
been drawn across his path, gave way
according to these reports with a will
ingness that indicated their co-operation
with him rather than with the
American forces. '
Army men here were .Inclined to be
lieve reports of inefficiency and half
hearted co-operation and today con
templated the probable future of the
second phase. of operations Just begun
by the commander of the punitive ex
pedition. Reports from General Per
shing to General Funston dealt only
with routine subjects, principally those
having to do with the transportation
of supplies. The positions of troops
were not revealed but it was known
that" the cavalrymen were still riding
hard along the trail left by Villa. Of
ficers of the quartermaster's depart
ment studied the best methods of get
ting provisions, especially supplies for
the horses and mules, to the field army,
while General Funston and his staff
anxiously studied the map, referring
rrequentiy to the scale of miles that
showed the advanced cavalry columns
rapidly nearing points 300 miles away
from the border.
It was realized here that the early
capture of Villa would be little better
than an accident. With their know
ledge of the country and with the as
sistance they can obtain along their
route, Villa and his followers, it is
feared, will have no difficulty in keep
ing ahead of the pursuing Americans.
Their hope for an early ending of the
chase is that Carranza troops will fin
ally check Villa's flight or that Villa
himself after joining one or more of his
wanaenng oanas in southern Chihua
hua or from Northern Durango, may
decide to fight it out with the steadily
advancing cavalry of the punitive force.
That Villa will be able to effect a
juncture with a considerable force be
fore he Is brought to a stand again is
regarded at headquarters here as prob
able. Canuto Reyes, one of his gener
als, who has been operating in the vi
cinity of Torreon, is known to. have an
exceedingly mobile force that is by no
means negligible and in the state of
Durango it is said the Arrieta Brothers
are in a position to move northward to
his support.
Unofficial observers have offered a
theory, regarded as somewhat fanciful
by American military men, that Villa,
after joining these and others will con
tinue his movement to the south with
the hope of gathering strength as he
goes and with Zapata and other ene
mies of the Carranza government, at
