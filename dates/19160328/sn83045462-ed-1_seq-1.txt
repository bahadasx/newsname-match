GERMANY IS ASKED
IF UNDERSEA BOAT
ATTACKED SUSSE
Formal Inquiry of Berlin Go\
ernment a Step Toward
Positive Action.
PRESIDENT MAY SUBMIT
THE CASE TO CONGRES
Disavowal by Germany Might N<
Be Entirely Satisfactory
to Washington.
ARMAMENT ISSUE IS RAISE
Putting Blame on Command!
Would Imply Inability to Make
Reliable Distinction as to
Status of Vessels.
I lie I nited States lias inquire
of (ierinanv. through Ambassad<

marines torpedoed the (Iritis
channel steamer Sussex.
Siq-rptrirt- I ativmo- rinnnillli'P
after the cabinet meeting t< >da
t'lat it had been decided to mat
-licit an ini|tiirv. and later it vvj
learned that the inquiry had bee
made, and in fact, probably
already in Berlin. The preser
-tatti- of the communication
that of an inquiry: it was not at
vanced to the stage of a prote:
or a demand.
Immediate Break Unlikely.
While cabinet members declared th
situation grave they took the positic
that a break with Germany was not a
immediate prospect. It was said, ho*
?\er, that if Germany admitted toi
pedoing the Sussex a situation woul
be brought about which would he mo:
serious.
Cabinet members agreed that the de
ciaion would depend much upon Gei
irany's reply to the American inquir;
Should Germany deny that one of he
submarines attacked the Sussex, th
American government would reach it
conclusion from the evidence now bein
collected by its diplomatic represents
tives abroad.
Cabinet members said the decision t
make an inquiry of Germany was in lir
with the policy of collecting all informs
tion before a decision was reached.
Should Germany admit the attac
but claim the aubmar Tie command*
exceeded his orders, officials believe
that would be regarded as evident
that it was impracticable for ?ubms
tine commanders attempt to dii
t;nguish between armed and ur
armed vesse'.s.
The possibility that the attack o
he Sussex might lead to a gener;
earing up or" the submarine isst
was discussed at the cabinet meeting.

W i le the evidence at iiarci indicat<
t c?t the steamers were torpedoed wit!

injuries to several Americans on the Sui

It is said that he i> seriously coi

He certainly would take that step, it

Ambassador Is Due Today.
Ambassador BernsforJT. who has bet
away for several days, was due to r<
turn today, and it was expected th;
he would consult with h'e< retary Lan
Ing over the situation.
It i? stared authoritatively that if
German submarine fired the torpedo
which sank the Englishman and dan
aged the Sussex. Germany would di
avow the a- t. punish the submarir
commander, offer reparation and sa
lsfy the T'nited State;- that the act w;
in violation of instructions.
The issue therefore, seemed to cor
down to the question of whether t
