Explain Law.
iVfr. Lord explained the various
provisions of law governing an as
sessor's duties. He reminded them
that they had taken an oath to per
form their duties in accordance with
the laws of the state and urged them
to be true to their solemn obliga
tion. He said that tax paying can
probably never be made a pleasant
duty, but if taxpayers could feel fair
ly certain that their tax money was
honestly handled and wisely spent
and that the property of their neigh
bors was assessed the same as their
own, we would probably hear less
murmuring and fewer complaints.
He said it was so clear as to be
self-evident that if the property of
every taxpayer in every taxing dis
trict in the state was placed on the
assessment books and valued accord
ing to the same rule, the result would
be a fair and uniform assessment all
over the state, and that this is just
what will happen if the property of
every citizen is assessed according to
law, hence the reason the commission
insists that-the law .must be carried
out by every assessor just as it is
written.
Assessor Responsible.
He said the opinion is quite prev
alent throughout the state
that in some way not clearly under
stood the assessor is responsible for
high taxes. Taxes are unquestion
ably high, but the assessor has no
more to do with making them so than
any other citizen. The duty of the
assessor is simply to value the prop
erty upon which the taxes are levied.
The assessment is simply a factor to
determine how much each person
shall contribute to the expense of
government, but it does not deter
mine the amount of the tax. It is
the amount of money that is voted
for public purposes that determines
whether taxes shall be high or low.
Large appropriations mean high
taxes. When a community is spend
ing large amounts of moneyit mat
ters not what fortaxes will inevi
tably be high but the assessor as an
officer has absolutely nothing to say
about how much money shall be
spent. The amount of money to be
raised by taxation is determined by
town meetings, school meetings, vil
lage and city councils, county boards,
the legislature, and by the people
themselvesnot by the assessor.
Justice in Taxes.
It is said that while the assessor
has practically nothing to do with
making the taxes of a community
high or low he has nearly everything
to do with making them fair and
just. .From the standpoint of the
individual taxpayer he is the most
important officer who has anything
tp do, "with {taxation. If he com
plies with his oath of office and does
his work in the way that the law pro
vides,7
approximate justice will pre-
vail among all of the taxpayers of
his district, but if on the other hand
he departs from the standard fixed
by law, or if he omits any consider
able amount of property from his list,

Over 100 Persons Attend Interesting Meetings at Court House Much

The assessors of Beltrami county

conference with the state tax com
mission, Samuel Lord, chairman, and
J. G. Armson, a member of the com

BEMIDJI, MINNESOTA, TUESDAY EVENING, MABCH 28, 1916.

Armson and Samuel lord of State Tax Commuuon: Outline Taxes
in County Total Tax Levy Payable This Tear
111633,680.40.
his assessment will inevitably abound
in the grossest inequalities and re
sult in the rankest injustice. Tax
payers whose property is not all list
ed and assessed will- pay lees than
their share, and taxpayers whose
property is all assessed will pay
more than they ought to.
In nearly every community tax
dodging is resorted to most by people
who are best able to pay. It is not
the citizen of limited means whose
property is all in sight and easily
found by the assessor who escapes.
Such people as a rule pay taxes on
every dollar's worth of property they
have in the world. It is among
people with bulging pocket-books
where we find our flagrant tax dodg
ers. Many of these people by one
dishonest device or another evade
every tax that they safely can. It
is this class of citizens that make
the burden of taxation harder than
it should be foe. honest taxpayers
because all taxes which by trickery
and dishonest methods tax dodgers
get out of paying must be made up
by the less favored and more honest
taxpayers of the county.
To Aid Assessors.
The tax commission will aid asses
sors by every means in its power to
enforce the law against this class of
citizens and when a false statement
by a.-taxpayer: isi called to our atten
tion we will see that the matter is
placed in the hands of the county at
torney for prosecution. Much can
be donejby/ assessors to^ prevent tax
Mdgihg if th^ywiil^erlornt their
duties fearlessly and diligently and
in strict accordance with law.
Mr. Armson, in addition to a de
tailed explanation of the new clas
sified assessment law, discussed tax
rates in Beltrami county at some
length.
He said that in a general way
growing tax fates are largely due to
the expanding functions of govern
ment-estate and localand to an in
creasing demand on the part of the
people for more things and better
things from each of the units of gov
ernment. We now demand and in
sist that numerous things be done by
government that we did for ourselves
years ago or left undone entirely. To
do-these numerous things revenues
are necessary, and the necessary rev
enue must be raised by some form
of taxation, so that every expansion
of the functions of government en
tailing the expenditure of money
must inevitably be followed by high
er taxes.
High tax rates do not necessarily
mean extravagant expenditures. If
the money derived from tax levies is
wisely and economically expended
the benefits derived by the taxpayer
may fully compensate for a high tax
rate. This is a question, however,
that each district must decide for it
self.
Tax Levy $633,680.40.
He analyzed the amount and pur
pose of the present tax levies of the
county and said that the total tax
levy in Beltrami county last year
and payable this year amounted to
$633,680.40. Each $100 of this
amount, when collected, will be ap
portioned as follows: To the state
for support of state government and
state institutions, $2.18 to the coun
ty, $31.58 to the towns, $4.58 to
the cities and villages, $13.71 to edu
cation, $32.86, and to roads and
bridges, $14.89.

ple. In a majority of cases it was
reported that- the houses were ocou-
pied by birds.

and three stories. Not only places
for nesting are made, but food shel
ters from winter weather have been
erected.
In addition to training the students
in building the houses, the contest
will be highly beneficial to the stu
dents as it teaches the useful variety
of birds and the harmful species.

mon inch and a half lumber. Cop
per and tin sheeting is used for roof
ing.

$20,000.
Attorneys P. J. Russell and Charles
W. Scrutchih went to Red Lake Falls
Monday afternoon where they will
take up the case of George Norberg,
now a pauper at the Bemidji poor
farm, who asks for $20,000 damages
for injuries he alleges he received in
January, 1915, at Kelliher when he
was thrown in an intoxicated con
dition from the place operated by
Oscar Thyren and Ole Pearson. Nor
berg alleges that he froze both arms
to such an extent that they were am
putated near the elbows, making him
a helpless cripple for life.
Attorney Russell is appearing for
the defendants and Attorney Scrutch
in for Norberg.
The case was started in the dis
trict court here but on the request
of the defendants for a change of
venue it was changed to the spring
term of court at Red Lake Falls.
When the plaintiff alleges he re
ceived the liquor, Kelliher was sup
posed to be dry under the provisions
of the Indian treaty of 1855 and in
his complaint Norberg alleges that
the liquor was sold to him without
a license and after 11 o'clock at
night. FUNERAL OF JOHN

board, presided at the meeting.
"Although I do not know the his

Nymore, it is evident that you have
a resident district without industries,
in Nymore," said Mr. McLean in a
talk. "The school enrollment reach
es 300 and your schools cannot be ac

through demands of the state provide
Nymore with industrial branches,
such as manual training, sewing,
cooking and mechanical drawing.
"Then again it would bring to
this district influence of the laws of
the state and certain advantages..'
along the line of aids," said Mr. Mc
Lean. "Under the new law $500
would be provided annually to be ap
plied on an industrial work. There
would also be an aid for transpor
tation, making it easy for pupils to
get to the central school and to the
industrial building."
With an assessed valuation of $72,-
000, Nymore has $252 behind each of
their three hundred school children,
whereas Bemidji with an assessed
valuation of $1,600,000 has $1,119 to. 7
support each of its thousand school
children. These figures were used to
show the urgent need of consolida
ting with Bemidji.
"There is absolutely no compar
ison of the two districts," said a mem
ber of the school board. "We have
issued warrants and not voted bonds
or provided taxes with which to pay
them. It is the same as running a
grocery bill. When you run a gro
cery bill you can live and eat until
your credit is not good, then you
have to pay your bills or starve.
Now we are getting to the time when
our schools have to pay the bill or
starve."
