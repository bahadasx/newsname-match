SAN* ANTONIO. Tex.. March 28.?
Prevented from using Mexican railways
over which to send supplies to
American troops, Mnjor General Funston
today decided to ask for two additional
motor truck companies?flftyfour
powerful trucks?to meet the sit- ,
tiatlon. The new campanics will be ,
placed In service as quickly as the
cars can be purchased.
Four companies?a total of 104
trucks?are now operating from the!
army base at Columbus to General
Pershing's headquarters some 250
miles from the border.
The problem of sending supplies to
the American force continued today to
overshadow all other questions.
Indications from Washington that
the Mexican railroads will not be made
available in the Immediate future
came as unwelcome news to department
headquarters. Because of the
Imperative need for railroad lines It
had been honed that officials in Washington
would obtain a favorable answer
from General Carranza.

WASHINGTON. March 28.?A memorandum
to General Carranza pressing

for permission to use Mexican rajlroadn
in supplying American troops in
pursuit of Villa was prepared Tuesday
at the state department.
It will he forwarded to Queretaro
late Tuesday and he delivered by
Special Representative RodgerB to
General Carranza.
, The memorandum points out that the
problem of supplying troops now more
than 200 milos from the border is a
pressing one and need not he delayed
for the protocol covering the general
subject. General Carranza's suggestion
as to modification and addition
to the draft of the protocol are Btlll
required to bring the agreement Into

EL PASO, March 28?The pursuit
of Francisco Villa may be hampered
If not actually halted unless Mexican
railroads are made available as the
main lino of communication for the
American army In Mexico. Military
men expressed that vie*- Tuesday
after studying despatches from the
front that Vllla'-was still In full
flight southward and meeting with
little opposition.
The American forces are more
than 200 miles below the border.
Every mile the Mexican bandit advances
Into the Interior increases the
difficulties of maintaining the already
attenuated line of American communication.
There is'much pessimism In army
circles over the prospects of capturing
Villa and It is felt that unless
he is cornered within the week the
bandit will have outrun his . pursuers
and that many months may
pass before he and his band can be
ferreted out of their hiding places
k In the mountains.
Despatches from the advanced flying
column pressing Villa closely
make no mention of having come
in contact with any or tne oanaics
men.
