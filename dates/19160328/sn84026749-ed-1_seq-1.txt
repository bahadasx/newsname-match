Defeat Due to Parliamentary
Move Which Linked Both
Together on Vote.
WRANGLE FOR TWO HOURS
Anti-Woman Suffragists Said to
Have Forced Action on Both
issues Jointly.
By a vote of ten to nine, the
House Judiciary Committee today
indefinitely postponed considera
tion of the so-called Susan B.
Anthony amendment for woman
suffrage and the national prohibi
tion amendment.
This action of the committee,
taken after a stormy session,
means there will be no vote at
this time'on either prohibition or
woman suffrage, despite the
strongest efforts brought to bear
to get such legislation before the
House. ., , i
.The defeat in committee'of the
two propositions was due to the
fact that by a shrewd parlia
mentary move they were linked
together on the vote. Effort
i.ade by Congressman Moss of
West Virginia, and others to rorce
a separate vote, were unavailing.
VOTE IN SECRET SESSION
m,. iinuin of the two troublesome
Issues left members ot the committee
In a quandary Because om ""'"
who favored prohibition were against
woman suffrage, awl vice versa.
The anti-woman luffraglsts In the
committee are said to have been behind
the parliamentary maneuvering that
Joined suffrage and prohlblUon and
forced the Joint vote. Congressman
Carlln of Virginia U understood to have
j. .v.- mnHnir that killed both prop
ositions, at least so far as the present
session of Congress Is concerned.
The vote was taken at an executive
session of the committee, but It was

parliamentary buu" .-
Secured Reconsideration.
uiu Anne MarUn, of the Congres-
slonnl Union, was at the head of the
delegation of woman suffragists who
waited the discouraging news from the
committee room.
The suffragists were recently suc
cessful In obtaining a reconsideration
of the former action of the committee
In sidetracking the Anthony amend-
"Thfs reconsideration, however, was
fruitless, because woman suffrage be
came tied up with, prohibition.

MYSTERIOUS BUOYS ALARM
COAST GUARD MEN
NORFOLK, March 28. Considerable mystery and speculation today
was attached to the finding of a string of white buoys along the
Virginia and North Carolina coasts.
The uneasiness of shipping men, who say the buoys are a menace to
vessels, may result in a Government investigation.
Two were picked up by the cutter Onondaga off the Virginia Capes.
Two were seen off False Cape.'
One theory advanced was they were strung along the coast by British
warships. Another was the possibility of their being bases for
submarine observation.
In every instance the buoys were about five miles off shore.

During the morning Hwann had or

Uons:
Why did Mrs. Horton retain an attor
ney If her reiaUons with Dr. Walte were

What induced Mrs. Horton and Dr.
Walte to -rent a luxurious studio In

career indicates complete change ot
attitude toward her on the part ot the
dUtrlot attorney.
It was from Mrs. Horton that the
district attorney first learned that Dr.
Walte purchased cultures of typhoid
and tuberculosis.
Bwann reiterated today that he had
no evidence to point to the fact that
Mrs. Horton was identified with any
crime.
Condition Improving.
Meantime, Dr. Walte showed contin

made to his brother. Frank Walte.
As evidence has piled up Dr. Walte
has been styled "a inonjmental and

he purchased the disease cultures to ad

that a cursory Inspection would reveal

Hotels Here Not To
Boost Food Prices
New York and Philadelphia
Houses Charge Extra for
Bread and Butter.
Go to New York or Philadelphia and
you will have to pay 10 cents extra for
bread and butter henceforth In any big
hotel or restaurant.
Not so In Washington. Neither do
Washington hotel men show any sign
of following their example of adding
IS cents to the price of steak or even
ot soaking the lobster consumer 25
cents extra.
"No rise of prices Is contemplated
here, and we have not made any in five
years," was tne terse statement or the
manager oi one ot me cuy s largest
hotels.
About the same answer was given by
the managers ot other hotels and res
taurants. The bread nnd butter Item Is a big
one. In some of Washington's larre
hotels, in busy times, it oxceeds 1100
a day. In many smaller ones It ranges
about $W and KO. But despite tho sour
ing prices ot many commodities, no
evidence that Washington hotel men
are going to boost their prices could
be found.
Bo far as the Hotel Men's Associa
tion here Is concerned, It is not a bit
troubled by the example of Now York
and Philadelphia, according to Its mem
bers. The association has not mot for
several months, became there has bern
little business pending, und no action
about prices Is expected when It does
meet, members stated today.

BERLIN'S VIEW OF THE
ALLIES' CONFERENCE
BERLIN, March 28. Tentative terms of peace are being
discussed for the first time by the allies at the war conferences
now In session in Paris, according to information from Swiss
souces today.
In spite of officially inspired articles appearing in the Eng
lish and French newspapers, the allies are seriously considering
means of bringing the war to an early end.
Berlin expecU no peace hints from allied sources until the
allies make their expected attempt to break the German front
in the west.
The Anglo-French offensive will be launched late in April
cr May, it is believed here, and will be followed by certain de
feat and the beginning of informal negotiations for peace.
Discord is again reported between the French and British
war offices because of the failure of England to send the prom
ised contingents to the Continent for the spring offensive.
The British government fears the effect on public sentiment
at home if a British army suffers enormous losses in such an
offensive, and is holding in England the armies recruited in the
past seven months.
To further its policy, the Asquith ministry has encouraged
the London newspapers to raise the bugaboo of a German in
vasion of England as an excuse for holding large armies at
home, according to the German view.

The French are continuing their at

The situation around Verdun and In

SKEPTICAL ABOUT REPORT
Rumor, Which Comes From No
Official Source, Fails to In
spire Response Echo.
America will ask Germany
whether a German submarine was
responsible for the attack upon the
channel packet steamer Sussex.
This inquiry, which the Cabinet
decided upon this morning as a
matter of form, will be sent tonight.
If, say officials, it is shown that
Germany has violated her pledges
net to attack unarmed merchant
men without warning, there is little
to encourage this Government to
accept further promises.
The time is past for diplomatic
persiflage, is theviewof ,many in
authority here, atjd,jhcre"TsT every
indication that President Wilson is
through with note-writing.
CABINET GRAVE.
The President nnd his Cabinet met
thl morning in
one of the gravest
meetings held since the pumnarlne con
troversy first was opened between this
country and Germany.
With circumstantial evidence accumu
lating to indicate that Gernan subma
rines were responsible for the destruc
tion of the eteamshlps Englishman and
Sussex, and tho consequent Imperiling
j of American lives, one all-Important
Question faced the Cabinet.
It was to be answered by the Presi
dent and his advisers whether, It the
eidence Is substantiated, the United
States again Is to accept expressions ot
rcprer and offers of reparation.
An Indication of the temper of officials
here 1h contained In the fact that there
Is no responsive echo to tho Inspired
suggestion from German sources that
tho Berlin government will promptly
disavow the attacks, offer reparation,
and promise to punish the submarine
commander responsible, if a German
submarine was responsible.
Interested in Source.
Where this Inspired German state
ment came from Is a matter of Interest
to officials. Neither from the German
embassy here, nor from Ambassador
Gerard In Berlin, has any direct word
come to the United States Government
as to Germany's attitude.
Officials believe that the utterance
emanates from "pro-German" quarters
eager to calm public feeling In this
country, while Germany, In the light of
further facts that might ho developed,
determines whether to admit or deny
responsibility.
At the Cabinet meeting today It
wns decided that before definite ac
tion Is determined it must be learned
byond possibility ot a doubt whether
submarines or mines were respon
sible. If the former, the indications are
that the United States will proceed on
the assumption that the submarine
or submarines were of German na
tionality. And In that case there
seems little doubt at present but that
the President will hand Count von
Bernatorff his passports and then ad
vise Congress of what he has done.
In the meantime. It was decided at
the Cabinet that as a matter of form
the State Department should address
an Inquiry to Germany concerning
what It knows of the attacks.
