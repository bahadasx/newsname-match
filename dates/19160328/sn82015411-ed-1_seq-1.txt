THE COMING VISIT
OF THE GOVERNOR
Governor Pinkhatn will come to
Kauai between the 1st. and 10th.
of April to make further investi
gations into the matter of railroad
facilities for the homesteaders .in
the Waipouli section. He will be
accompanied bv B. G. Rivenburgh,
the new land commissioner, and
James Dougherty, a member of
his military staff. Superintendent
Forbes and perhaps others may be
in the party.
In speakhiR of the matter at
Honolulu Governor Pinkham gnve
the impression that he was in favor
of immediate action of some sort
in this railway matter, but wished
to feel that all persons having, or
feeling, an interest in the propo
sition should be as nearly satisfied
as possible. While here t h e
Governor will probably encourage
a mass meeting, at which all wish
ing to be heard may have an op
portunity to speak. How long
the Governor and party will re
main here is not yet known de
finitely, but the presumption is
that it will merely be between
Wednesdayand Saturday.

SEASON'S
S S
STEAMERS TO BE
CHANGED
AROUND
The proposal has been semi
officially advanced from Honolulu
to take the Kinatt off the Lihuc
Waimea end of her present route
and to put her on the old W. G.
Hall's route, making two trips a
week to Nawiliwili and Ahukini,
from Honolulu. .The steamer
Maui, which recently took the
W. G. Hall's route, would, under
this arrangement, be transferred
to that part of the route between
Nawiliwili and Waimea, taking
the present run of the Kinati.
The argument advanced in favor
of this scheme is that it would
make of the Kinau a twice-a-week
boat in place of a weekly as at
present (just what the captain and
purser of the Kinau will do about
it. however, has not vet been
learned). Moreover, it would give
the larger boat to the larger freight
end of the island the Lihue side.
A third argument advanced is that
most passengers leave from Nawi
liwili anyhow.
Just what the people of the
Waimea end of the island will sav
to all this has not yet developed.
It is hardly likely that they will
relish the idea of apparently going
backward in place of forward in
the matter of steamer accommoda
tions, and a great big kink mav
reasonably be expected.
It is understood that the pro
posal, has been sent over for tire
o. k. of certain patties which, if
obtained, will set the new system
going,
LADIES PLAY FOR
The final match in the ladies'
Kauai championshfp games was
played off last Saturday in Lihue,
proving to be of thrilling interest
and affording many opportunities
to bring out the strong points of
each player,
Miss Silburn Purvis and Miss
Melicent Waterhouse won the sec
ond and third sets from Mrs. W.
K. Schultze and Miss Banham.
The first set was an easy victory
for the visitors who got it with
a score of 6-1, the home team ap
patently taking the opportuity to
warm up.
In the second set however, play
ing was very close, practically
each player getting her serve
until the score stood at five all.
Some very fine back-hand returns
on the part of Mrs. Schultze were
responsible for a number of points
in favor of her side, while toward
the end close net playing by Miss
Waterhouse drew the score to 7 5
in favor of her side.
The third set proved to be al
most the reverse of the first, Miss
Waterhouse and Miss Purvis tak
ing six games straight with only
the third a protracted deuce game.
The final score stood in favor
of the home team 1-6, 7-5, 6 0. In
connection with the championship
a pair of rackets offered by Mrs.
Hans Isenberg, are to be present
ed to the winners.
Mr. Eric Knudsen officiated in
the capacity of umpire during the

TODAY'S AND
NEWS
Sugar, 5.71.
Honolulu The College of Hawaii is criticized for its farming
course. Jared G. Smith, professor of agronomy, leaves the faculty at
the request of officials. The retiring educator says that the policy
with reference to agriculture is not productive.
Advices from Washington say that Hawaiian affairs are receiving
the attention of Congressmen. The military highway for Oahu, for
instance, has been taken seriously into conference.
George R. Carter boosts Roosevelt.
Francis M. Hatch will succeed R.W. Shingle, as city surpervisor,
the well known citizen and lawyer having accepted the invitation of
the mayor to join the Board,

witn general approval and Mayor Lane is highly gratified.
The Fight For Sugar
Washington The Democratic caucus of the Senate votes to ex
tend the time for taking the tariff off sugar to May 1, 1920, and the
committee will so report. This substitute for the House measure
was adopted by upper libuse Bourbons bv a vote of 23 to 7 after dis
cussion in conference. The opposition consists of numerous factions.
Senators from Louisiana are strongly against the bill, holding that it
would leave growers without assurance as to the future.
The new immigration measure is declared to be an insult to Ja
pan. New York Representative argues for the elimination of the anti
Asiatic clause. He says that the Japanese are keeping to the agree
ment loyally and showing every disposition to avoid possible points
of friction.
Up To Congress
Wilson asks Congress to act upon the submarine tangle at once.
It is reported that the President intends to shift the entire responsi
bility for the submarine situation upon Congress.

Washington Free sugar in 1920 is the plan that will go to the
Democratic caucus committee tonight.
Senator Broussard, of Louisiana, opposes this plan of the Senate'e
finance committee. Senator Simmons speaks in its favor.
Senator Martine. of New Jersey, demands that his party stand by
the platform rromise for the removal of the tariff on sugar in May
next. It is just possible that a decision mav be reached tonight.
Submarine Situation Tense
The submarine situation is growing even more tense, and the re
lations of the United States and Germany more grave. The Englisk
man and Sussex incidents both in flagrant defiance ot American rights,
have served to intensify feeling and complicate matters.
Each day is adding more victims to the list made by undersea
raiders. ,

Left Pineapples
About 30,000 cases of pineapplee
were left by the Hyades at Port
Alltn Sunday afternoon when she
sailed for the coast. The reason
given was that she was full of sug

of the vessel to take their ship
ments. Writing Up Waipouli
Andrew Farrell, a writer o f

came over to Kauai Wednesday
morning and is visiting all of the
schools of the island. On Wednes
day he took in Kckaha and par
tially finished Eleele. Thursday

THE NEXT PICTURE
E OF THE FOG"
Willie Fernandez has another
great picture coming. It is en
titled "The Voice of the Fog",
and will be started at Makaweli on
the evening of the 29th. The full
schedule for this picture appears
on page 2 of this issue. Following
is an interesting press comment on
"The Voice of tlie Fog."
"The Voice of the Fog," in
which Donald Brian makes his de
but as a paramount star in a pro
duction of the Jesse L. Lanky Fea
ture Play Company, is a picturiza
Uon of Harold Mac Grath's widely
read novel of the same name, which
is considered one of the master
pieces of modern day fiction of
suspense and mystery.
Mr. Brian as Thomas Webb in
"1 he Voice in the Fog" has ex
cellent .opportunity of which he
takes full advantage. Webb is a
young Englishman who inherits a
title and small fortune, but who
forfeits the use of his title for
three months to a professional
confidence man who involvesyoung
Webb in countless difficulties. The
story is carried across the ocean
to the United States, where Webb
finds employment as private secre
tary to a young woman who recog
nizes his voice as the voice she
heard one night in London at the
moment a mysterious hand from
out of the fog reached into her
cab and stole her necklace.
New Hotel Talk
Although plans and discussion
are vet of a very tentative charac
ter, it is possible that Waimea
may, at no distant date, have a
fine, new hotel. It appears that
the land included in a part of the
present hotel premises is much
needed by Hofgaard & Co. for
i heir lumber business, and may be
taken over at any time. A proposal
has, therefore, been evolved to
erect a new and more commodious
hotel on a lot belonging to Mr.
Brandt near the beach below the
bank. As stated above, however,
the matter is still in an unsettled
state and for the present nothing
of a positive nature tan be Riven
out.
If. Glass, an auditor in the em
ploy of C. Brewer & Co., is visit
ing Kilauea plantation.
