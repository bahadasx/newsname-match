San Antonio, March 28. The sup
ply problem continues to overshadow
all other matter having to do with the
punitive expedition in Mexico. Indi
cations from Washington that rail
roads will not be made available in the
immediate future at least for a
week came as unwelcome news to
dt partment headquarters early today.
Because of the imperative need for
rail linos it had been hoped by officers
that officials in Washington would
find a way of securing a favorable an
swer from General Carranza.
With the railroads closed. General
Funston faces the big problem of sup
plying General Pershing's forces for a
considerable period by means of motor
transportation and wagon trains.
Now 250 Miles in Mexico.
This means he must send great
quantities of supplies a distance of 250
miles south of the border in trucks
and wagons through a country that
is a barren waste of sand.
In order to meet the situation to the
best of his ability he has asked for ad
ditional motor trucks. Four com
panies a total of 107 trucks are al
ready in operation and two additional
companies will be added as quickly as
cars can be purchased and sent to the
border. General Kunston is expecting
a dispatch today from General Per
shing, giving the latest information
concerning the pursuit of Villa. Ac
cordine to unofficial reports, Ameri
ca n cavalry men are twenty miles be
hind the fleeing bandits.
I'ix Protocol lirst.
Washington, March 2 8. Adminis
tration officials today were taking
steps to aid General Funston in over
coming difficulties met with in keep
ing open a 2."0 mile supply line to the
American forces in Mexico.
Realizing that it may require a week
or more to perfect the proposed proto
col with the de facto government cov
ering the use of Mexfcan railways and
other matters concerning the interna
tional chase for Villa, officials were
preparing first, to press for prompt
disposition of the railroad request as
a separate isuo, and secondly to send
lemra I Kunston enough motor ve
hicles with which to maintain an ade
qua te supply system. It is phi nned
to establish supply depots at Intervals
along the lines of communication each
to be fed by the one immediately in
its rear and the border end of the sup
ply line to maintain constant vigil.
New Base at El alle.
Garranza's suggestions as to modifi
cations and additions to th proposed
protocol as worked out here, were un
der consideration at the state depart
ment today. It was stated that furth
er int rchanizes with the first chief
may bp required.
In the meantime it is said Carranza
desires to delay replying to the request
for the use of the railway until tlu
protocol has been agreed to. Latest
official reports at hand indicate that
General Pershing's advance base is in
th region of Kl Valle. ar.d that Villa,
who is reported to have got through
the network of Carranza troops, is far
to thf southward.

It was expected today's develop

l Germany intends to diminish her pro

; that the idea of conveying large bodies
j of troops to England is a dangerous
illusion and the military value of the
i Zeppelins is extremely limited. The
; fact that they can be reached by anti

In the Field in Mexico, March 27
via army aeroplane to Columbus, N.
M.. March 2 8). Some of the infantry
with the more advanced flying col
umns of the punitive expedition have
now covered over 180 miles of Mexi
can roads and are still moving. It is
not improbable that before they get
through they will have established an
American record for long distance in
fantry operations.
The foot sol fliers are in magnifi
cent condition. The cavalrymen of the
army are still talking about the 42
hour ride that was made by General
Pershing when he brought the cav
alry in by way of Hachita but the ,
"'dough boys" ;ire rapidly establish- j
ing a record that will stamp the j
Americans as greatest of all the i
world's foot soldiers.
A New liu.se.
A new base has been established
south of the first American base and
large quantities of supplies are being
hurried to the new point. From that
place columns are radiating thruugh
the surrounding hilKs.
It is believed Villa is bearing off to
the southeast but just how far he is
ahead of the nearest pursuing column
is a matter of pure conjecture. It is
declared by all who have seen him
in his flight that his mounts are un
shod and in poor condition and it is
known that some of the men and boys
he conscripted have deserted him on
learning that the entrance of Ameri
can troops in Mexico did not mean in
tervention. That the bandit chief has some am
munition cached is probable, but the
country through which he it now In
lieved to be traveling is known to bo
destitute of horses and horses he must
have.
News by Aeroplane.
One of the aeroplane squads which
makes t daily trip between the first
base and Columbus, N. M., is now tak
ing the matter written by 15 corre
spondents who are now following the
flying squadron. The planes can
make the journey in a very short time.
The calm of a beautiful sunshiny
Sabbath lay over the camp Sunday.
Most of the chplains of the various
organizations held services in the
morning, the Catholic chaplains be
ginning with mass, and in the after
noon there was a union service under
the huge cottonwood trees, which was
attended by most of the men in camp.
There are chaplains of all denomi
nations with the troops and the' are
doing very useful work. They look
after the mail for the men and do a
thousand other odd jobs besides at
tending to the spiritual needs of the
soldiers.
No News From Bout.
Inability to hear the returns of the
Willard-Moran prize fight held in New
York Saturday night bothered the
ramp more than anything else. There
is a srot of bulletin service from the
states maintained at headquarters, the
means of publication being a board
nailed to a tree.
But somehow the fight had been
stymned along the road ana at this
particular writing no one knows how
the battle came out. For the past
week little else had been talked of
around the campfires of the soldiers
and there has been some betting on
the proposition, too.

mediately, today was discussed by
President Wilson with his cabinet and,
with Senator Stone, his chief con
gressional adviser on foreign affairs.
Hot h cabinet members and Senator
Stone were said to have told the pres
ident he would bo backed by congress
and the public if he should take tb
more drastic step.
Meanwhile the state department was
gathering every bit of possible evi
dence in line with the determination
of President Wilson not even to mak
an inquiry of the German govern
ment until all phases of the rase had
been conclusively examined by this
government.
Message to Congrosss I nnc(isar.
It sc-cmed likely that the attitude
of congress will make unnecessary a
message from the president, if he
should determine to break off German
relations. From being rather a braka
on the administration's foreign policy
as in the case of armed merchant

Kansas Natural Declares a
Deficit of That Amount.
(Sends in Its Draft to (over
Corporation Tax.
The Kansas Natural r;as company
has a five million dollar deficit. That
is the news contained today in the
annual report of the gas company.
Hied with J. T. Botkin, secretary of
state, under provisions of the Kansas
corporation tax law.
Tn the report filed with the s?er
tary of state, the gas company as
serts it has resources amounting to
$16,530,607.75. of which $5, 537, 907. t
is property used in Kansas. The re
port was made from the offices ot th
gas company in independence. With
the report came a draft for $2,500,
the gas company's annual fee under
the corporation tax act.
Capital stock of the Kansas Natural
has been -educed six million dollar
in the last yeaT, the report shows.
This reduction, a footnote explains, is
in compliance with the creditors
agreement, which cailed for a reduc
tion of the capitalization from twelv
million dollars to six million dollars.
The encumbrance on the company's
real estate and plant is given at
$3,630,650. Heal estate owned by th
company is listed at $23,568.25, with
leasee valued at $1,092,738.68. Per
sonal property owned by the com
pany is valued at $4,421,599.72, with
total assets of $16,530,607.7.
Deficits of the company total a lit
tle more, than live million dollars
$5,006,620.68. to be exact. This deficit,
officers of the company contend, was
caused by an enforced rate which
prohibited the earning of a profit oa
: ihe property of the company. H was
I b-auw of the loss in revenues and
me iacK or an earning capacity on
the Invailmi'nt that the tns company
made its light for an increase in gas
rates. In December the Kansas nub-
I lie utilities commission granted a it-
rent rate. A fight for a higher rate is
now in the federal court.
