Paris, March 28.—One of those tak

tente allies, which held its flrst ses

Matin as describing the unique char
acter of ijjhe fathering.
"I have seen many conferences at
which statesmen and diplomatists took
part," this delegate said, "usually one
received the Impression that each per
son was carefulfy watching for an op
portunity to turn to his account the
mistakes of the others. But there was
nothing of that kind at the present
conference. A breath of high purpose
and resolve seemed to pass over the
historic assembly £nd to touch us all
deeply.
"We felt at every moment that a
work for humanity far" greater than
national aspiration was Incumbent on
us and guided ua to a single end. The
Image of the enemy we must reduce
was ever before our eyes. The abso-
grandeur for those who have the honor
to share in its deliberations."
