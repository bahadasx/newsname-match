MIGHTY CLOSE ESCAPE
THAT PETE HAD FROM
LOSING ALL HIS HAIR!
After Intimate association with murderers, burglars, safe cracksmen and
ivery other known criminal type for three days, Edward A. Peters, Tacoma
Times reporter, returned from the Walla Walla penitentiary today.
Peters is the first person in the history of the Washington
state prison ever to have obtained admission to the institution
for the purposes of investigation, without the knowledge of
prisoners or authorities.
Neither the warden, the 50 guards, or the 733 prisoners had
the slightest suspicion that Peters was anything but "Peter
Wilson, Convict No. 5547.*'
The reporter was registered under another Bertillon num
ber in the prison records, but out of deference to prison authori
ties, he has consented to keep his real prison number a secret.
"I was treated as an equal by all the inmates. I Avas re
ferred to as 'Mister Wilson,' and 1 noticed that all prisoners
spoke of one another as 'mister.
"Among themselves the convicts act and talk just the same
;is any representatives group of men that would be found out
side.
"There is no such thinf as duplicity or deceit among them.
because every man knows his brother's very thoughts, so to
speak. Men who are termed by the public as 'desperate crim-
I'KTKKH
inals' are sonic of the finest and most gentle fharantei* in the priWn.
"I had the experience of a lifetime. The inconveniences which I suffered
were easily repaid by the lesson of friendship, equality and decency taught
among the outcasts of society."

"I did not know Warden
Drum," said the reporter. "I had

the warden was kindly and cour
teous.
''I do not know, of course,,
what you have discovered in this
prison.' he told me. 'But 1 most
certainly believe that there is

"Many persons will wonder
why my hair was not clipped,"
said Peters today.
"I wonder at it myself, for they
had me in a barber's chair and a
trusty-barber was ready with the
dippers to trim off my head,
when f was saved, apparently by
Providence.
"11l my talk with Warden
Drum I had told him that I was
suffering from a severe cold, and
had trouble with my ear. 1 said
that 1 was afraid I would catch
cold if my hair were clipped. I
was also anxious. 1 said, to keep
my hair, because relatives might
visit me soon, and 1 wanted to

warden made no promises.
