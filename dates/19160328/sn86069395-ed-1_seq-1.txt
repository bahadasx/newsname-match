Col. Dodd Leading Pursuit
250 Miles Into Interior
of Mexico.
SLIPS THROUGH THE NET
Details of Operations Which
Culminated in Villa's
Escape.
Del Rio, Texas, March 20. In
creased uneasiness , was felt in this
section when it was learned that near
ly 1,000 Mexican soldiers have con
gregated at a dozen places within
thirty miles of the border. In Las
Vacas, opposite' here, it was claimed
the troops are Carranzistas.
Three hundred soldiers of the
Twenty-fourth infantry arrived here
today for a permanent patrol.
Francisco Villa has escaped from
the Mexican troops that had checked
him near Namiquipa, and three col
umns of American cavalry arc pur
suing him. Already they are almost
250 miles south of the border and un
less the elusive bandit is brought to
another stand this distance will be
greatly increased by the close of the
week.
Villa's success in extricating him
self from the dangerous position into
which he had been driven by the
American punitive force was related
Lin a detailed report of Gen. Pershing
that reached Gen. Funston today,
Gen. Funston forwarded therepoit
to Washington without making public
any but the essential features.
Col. Dodd is commanding the ad
vance columns that are riding hard
after Villa and his men and Gen.
Pershing has divided his forces so as
to provide supporting columns along
the thinly stretched lines of commu
nications from his most advanced base
at El Valle. From El Valle another
line is being maintained back to Casas
Grandes, directing the work of hold
ing together his forces and directing
so far as possible the operations of
Col. Dodd. Cavalry is being used
along the lines of communication with
El Valle, where a detachment of in
fantry is stationed.
Three aeroplanes are at El Valle
and will be used in scouting as soon
as the high winds that have been
sweeping that part of Mexico for al
most a week subside, and which, ac
cording to Gen. Pershing, have made
effective assistance by them impos
sible. Of the eight machines that went in
to Mexico, two are still out-of com
mission. They were damaged in the
flights from Columbus to Casas Gran

Christian county has recently voted
$400,000 for good roads. After April
1 the papers of the state will be men
tioning the fact that Union county has
joined the "progressives" by voting
$450,000 for road purposes. In no
county in the state where there has
been held an election for the purpose
of issuing bonds has the measure been
defeated. How sad it would be if
Union county, the noblest of them all,
I should prove to be the exception and
turn down the bonds, thereby pre
' venting the building of good roads!
But why contemplate the impossible?

the returns. Evansvillo Courier.

White Wyandotte Enthusiasm
is Sweeping All Over
the County.
ACME MILLS EGG PLAN
Experimenting in Standardi
zation is Being Watched
in Washington.
Secretary B. D. Hill has received a
letter from Mr. A. S. Chapin, repre
sentative of the Department of Agri
culture at Washington, in which he
says the department is showing much
interest in the poultry work being
done in this county and compliments
the White Wyandotte plan. They
will watch the proposition as a very
interesting feature in poultry work
and look for its success. Letters are
also being received , from poultry
clubs, poultry breeders and others
who express great interest in the nov
el plan to standardize White Wyan
dottes in Christian county. So much
interest isbeing shown in the distri
bution plan announced by the Acme
Mills, cc-opcrating with the Christian
County Poultry Improvement Asso
ciation and the Department of Agri
culture, that it has been decided to
increase the offer of freo eggs from
50 settings to 100.
Letters are coming every day from
people who are anxious to take ad
vantage of the offer.
BANKS ASSESSED
AT 100 PER CENT.
Increased From 80 Statutory
Direction, Says State
Auditor Greene.
Frankfort, Ky., March 27. Banks
and trust companies will be assessed
at 100 per cent, instead of 80 by the
State Board of Valuation and Assess
ment this year.
Eight years ago the board began
taking 80 per cent, of tho total capital
of the banks as the amount of
their assessment, and it was continued
under the last administration. State
Auditor Greene said, however, that
the board has only one statutory di
rection in regard to the assessment of
property and that is to make its fair
cash value.
Auditor Greene, Treasurer Good
paster and Secretary of State Lewis
are considering the method of assess
ing banks and other corporations. It
is undecided "whether they will take
the value of the stock as returned by
the banks or find the valuation from
tho capital and surplus and net earn
ings. The two systems, it is believedi
will bring very little difference in re
sults. The total revenue from banks last
year, according to the State Auditor's
reports, was $217,521.79, and a 20
per cent, increase would add $43,
504.23 from that source.

BRITISH AIR
RAID ENDS IN
SEABATTLE
English Fleet Escorting Aero
plane Sinks Two Ger
man Trawlers.
GERMANS CONTINUE SEIGE
Submarines Believed to Have
Sent Three British Ships
to Bottom.
' A British air raid on Schleswig'-
Holstem and resultant battle between
British warships and German armed
trawlers, in which three seaplanes
were brought down, two German
armed trawlers were sunk and a Brit
ish torpedo boat probably was in col
lision, gives diversity to the latest
war operations.
The violent bombardment of Ver
dun continues, while to the north of
the fortress and in tho Wouvre region
intermittent cannonading is in prog
ress. No infantry attacks have been
launched by the Germans except to
the southeast- of Fort Douaumont,
where Berlin reports a hand-to-hand
encounter with the advantage on the
side of the Germans.
The French in the Argonne forest
are keeping up their bombardments
of German positions. Considerable
artillery activity by the French also
has been shown in the Vosges. The
explosion of a French mine in this
region inflicted heavy losses on the
French, according to Berlin. The
German position was not impaired.
On tiie Russian front the Germans
attempted an offensive in the region
of Jacobstadt, but were repulsed,
while the Russians captured a Ger
man trench in the region of Dvinsk,
Heavy fighting is still going on in the
lake region southeast of Dvinsk. Here,
Berlin says, the Russian attacks broke
down.
Storms in the mountain regions of
the Austro-Italian lines have impeded
operations, but bombardments are
continuing on the Isonzo front.
In the costal region of the Russo
Turkish war theater the Russians are
making good progress against the
Turks, and also farther south in the
Lake Van region have thrown their
lines still further forward.
Three more British steamers have
been sunk, presumably by German
submarines. They are the Minneap
olis, once plying betweon American
ports and London; tho St. Cecilia, on
a voyage from Portland, Me., for Lon
don, and tho Fenay Bridge, bound
from Philadelphia for Hull. The
crews of the St. Cecilia and Fenay
Bridge were rescued. The fate of
the crew of the Minneapolis is not
known.
The exact number of casualties oir
board the cross channel steamer Sus
sex, which was blown up in the chan
nel Friday afternoon, has not yet
been determined. The French ad
miralty, basing its statement on affi
davits ot American jxissengers saved,
says the Sussex was torpedoed with
out warning.
A conference of tho entente allies
of far-reaching importance began.
at I'aris Monday. The premiers,
various other high goverment offi
cials, including tho British foreign
secretary and secretary for war, anil
the commanding generals of France.
Great Britain and Italy, will take part
in this conference, which will give
the closest consideration to tho milt.
tarvand political situation hrminlif
about by the war.
The Dutch ntialslry of marlatf says
that an examination of a piece of
bronzo metal found in a lifeboat of
the Dutch steamer Tubantia, recently
sunk, induces tho belief that it be
