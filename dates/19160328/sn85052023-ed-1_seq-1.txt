DROWNS IN
SUGAR CREEK
"Well Known Garrard Farmer, For
merly of Preachersvlle, Meets
Peculiar Fate.
David Anderson, formerly of the
Preachersville section, but who has
lived on Sugar Creek in Garrard for
a number of years, was drowned
Monday morning while attempting to
cross Sugar Creek on the Buckeye
pike. The stream was very much
swollen from a veritable cloudburst
which had occurred a few minutes
6 One" report is that Mr. Anderson's
team was running away, having been
started by a "heavy hailstorm which
was falling, and that the wagon be
came uncoupled and he was thrown
into the water. Another rumor is
that a powerful volume of water
struck the vehicle and team mid
stream and that the wagon was turn
ed over. The mules were washed
down stream some distance but final
ly swam out. , ,
Mr. Anderson's body was not
found for several hours but a search
ing party located it about a mile and
a half from where the accident oc
curred. The victim was a son of
William Anderson, who died in the
Preachersville section some dozen
years ago, and a half brother of the
well-known East End farmer, Jones
Anderson. He was in Lancaster when
the news came of his brothers mis
fortune and went immediately to the
scene. The body had been found
when he arrived.
Mr Anderson was about 50 years
old and besides a wife, he leaves sev
eral children.. He was an excellent
citizen and his untimely death cast
a gloom over the crowd which had
gathered at court at Lancaster.
NEGROES MAY BE DISMISSED

A dispatch from Washington said

Tardiff, two negro storekeeper
gaugers employed under Collector

It is understood that the charges
against the two local-negroes, grew
out of their participation in the last
councilmanic campaign in. this city,
and that they have taken the matter
up with the department at Washing
ton that they were not engaged in
"partisan politics" at that time, which
comes under the ban of the civil ser
vice rules. These cases will be
watched with much interest, as these
two negroes have held office now for
three years under democratic admin
istration. HIGHLAND

A SPECIFIC AGAINST COLDS.
The' nearest thing to a specific
against colds is a sleeping porch or
open bed room and a cold sponge
bath every morning when you first
get up. Even then you will occa
sionally take a cold, especially when
colds are epidemic, and when you do
you will find Chambejlain's Cough
Remedy a great help in enabling you
to get rid of it. Try it. Obtainable

KNOXVILLE ADVANCE MAN
Here Friday Going Over Ground
Trade Boosters Will Visit.
Mr. O. F. Whittle, representing
Knoxville's First Trade Trip, ann
President of the Whittle Springs
company, which operates a summer
resort at the Whittle Springs near
Knoxville, was a visitor in Stanford
Friday making arrangements for the
visit of the Knoxville business men
who will reach here April 12, at 9:05
A. M.
Mr. Whittle came here for the pur
pose of discussing with the local com
mittee the question of the program
to be followed upon the arrival of
the visitors aboard the Trade Trip
Special. Mr. Whittle stated that the
Trade Trip committee, comprised of
men representing every business or
ganization in Knoxville, decided on
this move to get in touch with the
p,eople here as a means of impressing
upon all of them that the trip is being
undertaken by Knoxville's business
men rather for the purpose of SEE
ING than of SELLING our folks. Mr.
Whittle stated that the business men
of Knoxville were just as anxious to
buy what we had to sell them as they
were to ship what they had to sell us.
In other words, it is more or less of
a "bartering" trip.
The personnel of the Trade Trip
will consist of men like Mr. Whittle,
who are owners or managers of the
business houses which they represent.
Mr. Whittle stated that he had ar
ranged to furnish complimentary to
Trade Trip committee Whittle Springs
water exclusively on the "special."
The Chamber of Commerce is leav
ing no stone untourned to show the
visitors that they are willing to meet
them half way in the effort being put
forth to establish closer business and
social relations between Knoxville
and Stanford business men.

The Christian Sunday school here
bested the Lancaster school of the
same denomination Sunday in the
contest, which has been on for the
past four weeks. There were 326
scholars and teachers in attendance
here and only 200 at Lancaster.
This is three out of four Sundays
that the local school has led Lancas
ter's. Rev. W. A. "Swift, of Lexington,
after preaching at the Methodist
fhurch Sunday, the 19th on Christian
Education, started a subscription for
increasing the endowment of Kentuc
ky Wesleyan College, at Winchester.
He was in the neighborhood for sev
eral days and secured $482. There
is hope of reaching $600. Rev. Swift
made a strong anr convincing plea.
At the Methodist church Sunday
morning just before Sunday school, a
section of plastering about six or
eight square yards in extent, fell
from the center of the peiling. For
tunately all persons present were
sufficiently distant to escape damage.
This catastrophe served to give a
new impetus to the afore mentioned
Droject of a new church building. It
is hoped something will materialize.
The Methodist Episcopal church at
St. Paul, Minn., has ordered the

MEDICAL SOCIETY MEETING
Discuss Prevention of Blindness In
Now-Born Babe.
The Lincoln County Board of
Health met in the county court room
at 10 a. m., Tuesday, March 21st with
the Lincoln County- Medical Society
to discuss the prevention of blind
ness in the new-born, babe and tracho
ma. Dr. W. B. O'Bannon gave a lec
ture on ophthalmia neonatorum, and
Dr. J. G. Carpenter, one on tracho
ma, to the physicians and mid-wives
of the county. The subjects were il
lustrated with plates and drawings
of the natural eye and the sequels
of the diseases from a pathalogic
view. Drs. Pipes, of Moreland, Ro
berta Carpenter, Hustonville, South
ard, Brown and Peyton, of Stanford,
Dr. J. B. Kinnaird, of Lancaster, and
six colored mid-wives' and Dr. Mpore,
of color, were present and entered
freely into the discussions. The mid
wives expressed a.vote of .thanks for
being called to be instructed and gave
the strictest attention

and twenty-four hours,

country.
Seventy-five per cent of the blind
ness in the new babe is due to opthal
mia neonatorum and 75 of blind
ness in other people is due to tracho
ma. It behooves theJtax payers to
take great interest in the above sub
jects, as they are laxed to keep up
the institution for the blind.
Trachoma is so prevalent in certain
sections of Kentucky, that the U. S.
Government has established hospitals
at various points by competent men
to help stamp out the disease of tra
choma, yet every physician worthy
of the name of doctor should be able
to successfully treat this disease.
Dr. Pipes read a paper on the se
quellae of "la grippe," dwelling at
large on sinus, laryngo-tracheal in
flammation, ear and brain complica
tions and specifically on labor pneu
monia. The essay was freely discussed
by Drs. O'Bannon, Peyton, Brown,
Southard, Kinnaird and Caroenter.
Thfi follo'winEr were rrtaced on the
'program for the next meeting at
Hustonville: Dr. Weddle, uompnea
tions of "la grippe;" Dr. Childress,
on treatment of "la grippe;" Dr. J.
G. Carpenter, treatment and pathol
ogy of Calle's and Barton's frac
tures by extension and counter ex
tension. It is an easy task to have a
good County Medical Society a post
graduate course at home, when ev
ery member becomes lnteersted and
takes a part, the greatest good to the
greatest number. We owe this to our
patients and humanity to keep posted.

LINCOLN TRUST
CO. FORMED
Stockholders of Progressive Finan
cial Institution Take Another
' Step Forward.
At their meeting Saturday, the di
rectors of the Lincoln County Nation
al Bank organized The Lincoln Trust
Company to be operated in connec
tion with the bank. The capital stock
is to be $25,000, divided into shares
of $25 each. The amount of $25
is to be paid to each shareholder of
the bank out. of its surplus fund and
the privilege given of taking the
amount in trust company stock, so
that each shareholder of the bank
can secure an equal number of shares
in the trust company by paying for
it with the amount paid out of the
surplus fund.
Business men and financiers be
lieve that a trust company has long
been one of Stanford's- most urgent
needs and it will doubtless prove a
great help to the community, as
it will be authorized to act as guar
dian, administrator, executor, trus
tee and curator. Quite a number of
other progressive banks in small
towns in the state have trust compa
nies affiliated with them, and this
step by the Lincoln County National
Bank will put it in the forefront with
other up-to-date and progressive in
stitutions of the kind, and enable it
to greatly extend its scope of useful
ness to the community in which it is
already such a potent factor.
CASEY BEATS ROAD BONDS.
News received from Casey county
Monday was to the effect that the
road bond question was defeated in

of bonds for the purpose of improv
ing the roads of Casey, which are
said to be in fearful shape, and also
to build some new pikes. There was
little active campaigning done there
for the bond issue, it. is said, which
may account for its defeat.

DARING JAIL DELIVERY.
A dispatch from Manchester, Clay
county, Sunday said: One of the
most daring jail breaks in the history
of Clay county was effected here
early today, when, holding prison
guards at bay, armed accomplices of
John D. Pace passed saws to him
through a window of the building and
told him to "get busy." Pace lost no
time, it .is said, quickly sawing the
bars of his cell window. He then
rode off with the band which libera
ted him. Friends of Pace, it is re
ported, helped the man saw through
the iron bars. Pace, formerly a mem
ber of the United States Army, was
under indictment on a charge of the
murder of his father and stepmother.
He killed them while they were asleep
it is alleged. A posse has followed
the Pace band into Owsley county,
where the members are said to be
strongly intrenched in a mountain
fastness.
Don't Neglect Kidneys
Swamp-Root, Dr. Kilmer's Prescrip
tion, Overcomes Kidney Trouble.
It is now conceded by physicians
that the kidneys should have more
attention as they control the other
organs to a remarkable degree and
do a tremendous amount of work in
removing the poisons and waste mat
ter from the system by filtering the
blood.
The kidneys should receive some
assistance when needed. We take less
exercise, drink less water and often
eat more rich, heavy food, thereby
forcing the kidneys to do more than
nature intended. Evidence of kidney
trouble, such as lame back, annoying
bladder troubles, smarting or burn
ing, brick-dust or sediment, sallow
complexion, rheumatism, warns that
your kidneys require help immediate
ly to avoid more serious trouble.
An ideal herbal compound that has
had most remarkable success as a kid
ney and bladder remedy is Dr. Kil
mer's Swamp Root. There is nothing
else like it. It is Dr. Kilmer's pre
scription used in private practice
and it is sure to benefit you. Get a
bottle from your druggist.
However if you wish first to test
this great preparation send ten cents
to Dr. Kilmer & Co., Binghamton,
N. Y., for a sample bottle. When writ
ing be sure and mention the Stanford
Semi-Weekly Interior Journal.

Governor Stanley Grants Pardon to
Sam M. WiJhite, Former City
Controller of Louisville.
His many friends and relatives in
this county, which is his old home,
are glad to learn that Sam M. Wil
hite, of Louisville, was pardoned by
Gov. Stanley late last week. The
daily papers say that among those
requesting the governor to pardon
him were Messrs. J. S. Hocker and
S. T. Harris and Dr. J. G. Carpenter,
of Stanford. Mr. Wilhite, who was
formerly City Controller of Louis
ville was granted a pardon Friday
afternoon by Governor Stanley of
what remained of the penitentiary
sentence he was serving for embez
zling $14,500 in bonds held by him
as a city official in 1914. Mr. Wilhite
pleaded guilty to the charge against
him in October, 1914, and was given
a sentence of from two to ten years
in the penitentiary.
Mr. Wilhite. who went to T.miisu
ville from Stanford, years ago, was
named Uity Controller in 1901 by
Mayor Grainger, and held that office
until the summer of 1914, when a
defalcation in his office was discov
ered by experts employed by Mayor
rsuscnemeyer. The method followed
by Wilhite was the hypothecation of
citv bonds that had heen dpnnsifPfl
with the city by contractors as a
guarantee ot their work. The city
lost nothincr bv the defalrat.Tnn ns th
amount, $14,500, was fully covered
oy a surety Dond. Wilhite later plead
ed guilty and went to the peniten
tiary. The pardoning of Wilhite re
moves from the State penitentiary
the chief bookkeeper at that institu
tion. Mr. Wilhite, who has long been
considered one of the best account
ants in the State, had revolutionized
the system of keeping books at the
penitentiary, and had put everything
in perfect condition during his stay
there. August F. Ropke, whose de
falcation at the Fidelity Trust Com
pany, of Louisville went above
$1,000,000, is stilLm.,the penitentiary
and will, in the future, have charge
of the prison books.
