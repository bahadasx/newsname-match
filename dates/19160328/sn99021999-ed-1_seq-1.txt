(Via London.) The Tageblatt of Berlin
says that at the annual meeting of the
propreaslve people's party In Berlin. Pr.
Otto Wiener made a statement In re
gard to tha attitude taken by members
of the party In tha Reichstag and the
Pruaalan Diet on the submarine ques
tion. He announced the party had sent
a telegram to Dr. Alfred Zimmerman,
tinder secretary for foreign affairs,
stating that It would never admit tha
illegality of submarine warfare and that
In negotiations with other powers, "we
cannot allow the submarine weapon to
be snatched from our hands."
Discussing recent differences of opin
ion concerning the use of submarines
and the ultimate affect of a conflict
with the United States, Dr. Wiener said:
"We are not afraid, and we shall re
gard new dangers with calm confidence,
but we wish to live In peace with Amer

the fatherland."
Alluding to the political agitation In
Germany, Ir. Wiener said It waa di
rected against the Imperial government,

"From the beginning we have demanded
Increased and accelerated construction
of submarines. If the building of sub
marines had been carried out earlier
and at a more rapid rate, their employ
ment In war possibly might have In
creased considerably. We shall not al
low the submarine weapon to slip out
of our hands."

Cnce the outlets are barred, squad
rons of cavalry and detachments of
infantry, operating from the base
near Casas Orandes, will comb' the
country and endeavor to flush their

This Is ths plan the military men are
following to effect the capture or tha

Villa and his band are moving rapidly
among the foothills of Blerra TaraJiu
mares, hotly pursued by threa columns of
American cavalry. Colonel George A.
Dodd Is directing tha cavalry movement.
This Information coming from army
offlclala at tha front confirms reports
brought here by American travelera from
the Caaaa Grandea district last Saturday
that Villa had escaped through tha lines
of the Carranxiata troops. Mexican Con
sul Garcia does not credit ths reports that
the Carranxa forces furnished no real
apposition to Villa and permitted tha ban
dit to escape.
Villa Scatters His CsaisuBS,
villa scattered his command in his
flight southward and at one time, It was
learned today, led only a small force of
fifteen or twenty men. The army censor
at Columbus haa permitted the Informa
tion to pass that Villa Increased his com
mand at El Valla by forcing thirty-five
joung men and boys to accompany him.

uiiuua in ineir expression tnat Villa never
will be taken. The nature of tho country
and tha fact that Villa la among his own
people, who Idolise him, make the ban
ait s capture unlikely, they declared. The
Mexican country where Villa la now
fleeing Is a land peculiar to itself. A
negro sergeant, an old campaigner In the
Twenty-fourth Infantry, now In that re.
glon. speaking to a Caaas Orandes
rancher, puts It thua: "1 have been In
