Steve Molnar, 35, a grinder em

Molnar was at his usual employ

a spark from the. emery wheel ignited

Alexander McNab, marine specialist
and inventor of this 6ity, living at 784
Fairfield avenue, who recentlv was
engage's in England and France, has
returned to this city with Mrs. Mc
Nab, who. accompanied him through
out the trips! They arrived on the
Cunard liner Abdula which was chased
by a submarine during a part of the
voyage. - .
phough Mr. . McNab, who- was sent
Dy England upon secret missions, nat
urally refuses to discuss his personal
activities, he has witnessed several in
teresting events and comes to America
with a hostof information that throws
new light upon many features that
have heretofore been somewhat ob
scure. Incidentally he has many souv
fenirs of the siege of Verdun, includ
ing German helmets, sharpnel, etc.
In reality he has made two trips
abroad. - He made one in July, return
ing to America and going back in Sep
tember to both England and France.
During his second absence he re
ceived word that his inventions dis
played at the Japanese International
exposition atTokio have been award
ed gold medals for excellence. This
is considered a nigh : honor.
A summary of his . observations
made abroad shows that in his opin
ion the , Zeppelin raids, while spec
tacular have availed the Germans lit
tle, though on the other liand the
Taubes are so formidable that an
enemy fears to bring them down be
cause of , the explosives they carry.
Observation also make Mr. McNab
believe that the Frenchman will nev

the Englishman- does not hate the
Austrian, but is vindictive to the ex

war could be won today by the Allies
t great sacrifice of -life; that Eng

127 German submarines, no crew of
which has been taken alive; that the
gaiety of England and France is lit

men are in reserve for the final drives
calculated to crush Germany1 without
touching her soil. "
Though. German air Craft could be
brought to earth by the , flying ma
chines and antirair craft guns, says
Mr. McNab, it would not be policy to
dd so, for it would bring tons of iron
and high-explosives upon the cities
over which they are traveling.1! The
defensive method 'is to puncture the
big bags, without causing explosion and
prevent the craft from reaching its

REV. E.H. KENYON
RESIGNS PULPIT;
IS TAKING REST
:
Pastor of St. Paul's Church
will Seek Improved Health
In Adirondacks. .
Rey. E. H. Kenyon, rector of St.
Paul's' Episcopal church, Bridgeport,
whose recent illness has been deeply
regretted by his parish and church
men generally throughout the state
has resigned from his pulpit here. A
letter of resignation was received by
the church wardens on Monday.
Mr. Kenyon, who was stricken early
in the year and compelled to seek
rest in the 'Adirondacks has not im
proved as much as his friends would
wish. Realizing that it would be
many months before he coud again
resume his duties here, he' decided to
relinquish the pulpit and devote him
self entirely to recuperation of health.
No' call has as yet been issued to
supply the vacancy though it is ex
pected that a call may be issued to
some of those who have provisionally
preached here.
- Mr. Kenyon has been rector of St.
Paul's for 14 years. He came here
from Yantic, Conn. Shortly after he
took charge of the parish, numerous
Improvements were made. - The in
terior of the church was redecorated
irC time for the observance of . the
50th "anniversary ofi the parsh, the
chancel "furniture renewed, choir
stalls provided, a $4,000 organ install
ed, and a bishop's chair and priedieu
purchased. The church rectory was
purchased, also, under his regime.
As a pulpit orator Mr. "Kenyon
ranks high among the Episcopal cler
gymen . of this vicinity. He is con
sidered among the ablest in the Fair
field archdeaconry.
When news of the resignation . of
Mr. Kenyon became generally known
today, there were many expressions
of regret mingled with hope that his
illness would not long continue.

Financial interests, including De
Ver H. Warner and members of the
Bishop family have decreed the pass
ing ! of the old, " unsightly one-story
blocks in the business district ' of
Bridgeport.',
That not only the holding of the
Warner and Bishop families will be
improved, but that other owners may
be forced into the improvement, of
property that has long been dormant
is intimated in rumors that are broad
cast today in realty circles.
In speaking of the matter today, Mr.
Warner frankly admitted his interest,
stating that surveys have already been
made looking toward plans for hand
some mercantile and office buildings
on the property jointly owned by him7
self and the Bishop family through
the will of his father.
"The time for eradicating the old
one?story building from the center bf
the city has come. Tiiey are unsightly,
do not serve an. adequate purpose and
reflect discredit upon the pity through
strangers who view them."
He admitted that plans are under
consideration for a large office build
ing, between six and ten stories in
height -Jtb replace the two store prop
erties now occupied by the Union Pa
cific Tea Co. and the Emerson Shoe
store. The detailed plans have not
been drawn.
Though the plans have not yet fully
crystalized it is rumored in realty
circles here today that other financial
and political interests are likely to
join hands in this move for a more
practical and beautiful business cen

A story today was to. the effect that
improvement would be made upon the
property now occupied by the Reid &
Todd Jewelry stores, the Hanke Hat
Co. and the Sonneberg Piano Co. Thisv
property is owned by others than the
Warner and "Rishop families. Whether
a deal has been consummated whereby
these properties would be included

firmed by Mr. Warner. Occupants of
the stores who have extended leases
on the' property were . not aware of
contemplated changes. ,
In commenting upon the rumor
realty dealers in the center of the city
asserted that to prevent a deterrent
growth of the business district to ex
tremes of one-story activity some large
and modern buildings must be erect
ed ' with elevator service that would
overcome the present resticence to lo
cate business offices above the ground
floor.
One dealer said:- "Bridgeport is
just becoming educated to going above
the ground floor, to do business. This
has been prevented . in the past to a
great extent by inadequate elevator
service. - Unless big buildings now take
the place of the old ones and the peo
ple are educated to using the upper
stories, Bridgeport will spread its
shopping district out like a mushroom
and the patronage will not be centered
as is desirable f rem a merchandising
standpoint." . . '

Washington, March 28 The
United States has inquired of
Germany, through Ambassador
Gerard, whether any of its sub-
marines torpedoed the British
channel steamer Sussex. v

ed after the cabinet meeting to-1
day that it had been decided to
make such an inquiry and later
it was learned that the inquiry
nad been made and, in fact.
probably is already In Berlin.
The present status of the !
communication is that of an in- j
quiry; it has not advanced to
the stage ,of a protest or de
mand. W
Members of the cabinet said '
that evidence in possession of
the United States was not con
clusive' enough to warrant deci,-
sive actiota at this time. Fori
this reason it was decided to 1
make inquiry pf Germany. A i
majority of the cabinet mem- j
bers, however, believed prelim- j
mary epons.deariy indicated
the Sussex was torpedoed." I
All evidence thus far received relat
ing to the Bin-king of the .steamship r
Englishman and the damaging of the
Sussex by an explosion, with Amer
ican citizens aboard, indicates that the
steamers' were, torpedoed without
warning with the probable loss of one
American. ' life on the. Englishman ,and
injury to eeveral Americans on the
Sussex. '
President Wilson ' is awaiting with
aeep concern receipt ' of positive proof
before taking definite action. It Is

move that' might lead to the breaking

the Englishman and damaged the Sus
sex, Germany would disavow the act.

offer reparation. In this event ' tha
question would seem to be whether
the American government' would be
willing to accept such a declaration.
On the other hand, if all facts are
not deemed sufficiently conclusive, it
is probable that this government ,
