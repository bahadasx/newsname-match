Tex., March 27.—Flying
columns of American cavalry are
seeking today to entrap Pancho Villa
and his band by sealing up all the
trails and passes in the mountainous
district south of El Valle. Once the
outlets are barred, squadrons of cav
alry and detachments of infantry oper
ating from the base near Casas
Grandes will comb the country and
endeavor to flush their quarry into the
open.
According to dispatches from the
tront, Villa has broken the Carran
cistas' line and fleeing southward with
the American troopers straining every
nerve to catch him before he reaches
the mountain wastes in the Guerreo
district.
The one hope of a speedy termina
tion to the chase is that the flight of
the bandits will be checked by starva
tion and the exhaustion of their
ponies. It is known that Villa is al
most destitute of both supplies and
Ammunition and the dead and dying
horses found along his trail give mute
&.f- but eloquent testimony to his desper
.» ate haste and need.
Once safely in the midst of the
Sierra Tarahumares, the task of run-1
ning the bandit to his lair will have
iy become one of tremendous difficulty.
A!towed to Escape?
Villa and his band are moving rap
idly among the foothills of the Sierra
Tarahumares, hotly pursued by three
columns of the cavalry movement.
^This information coming from army
officers at the front confirms reports
brought here by American travelers
from the Casas Grandes district last
Saturday that Villa had escaped
through the lines of the Carranza
troops. Mexican Consul Garcia does
not credit the reports that the Car
s' ranza forces furnished no real opposi
tion to Villa and permitted the bandit
to escape.
Campaign to Be Long One.
Villa scattered his commSnd in his
flight southward and at one time it
was learned today led only a small

YANKEE DOLLAR
WINS RESPECT IN
PEOPLE WARM UP TO AMERICAN
80LDIER3 WHEN PUR8E
STRINGS ARE OPENED.
Columbus, N. M., March 27.—The
American dollar rapidly is finding a
place in the hearts of the people of
northern Chihuahua, according to
soldiers and civilians arriving at the
border today from Gen. J. J. Persh
ing's headquarters. The people of the
districts through which thq American
troops passed at first were coldly
friendly but when they found the
Americans did not commandeer their
live stock and food supplies their
courtesy and friendliness increased.
The price, too, increased when the
inhabitants found that the Americans
had money and were willing to spend
it to satisfy their wants. An example
cited 1b that eggs were readily pur
chasable for ten cents a dozen by the
first troops passing through La As
cension but by yesterday the price
paid reached fifty cents a dozen and
showed signs of. rising further.
Lieut. H. A. Dargue of the aero
plane corps left early today on the
first trip from Columbus to Casas
Grandes in the recently established
aero dispatch line.
NEED RAILROADS.
San Antonio, Tex., March 27.—With
Villa known to be fleeing toward his
stronghold in the Guerrero district,
closely followed by troops of Gen. Per
shing's command, the problem of sup
plies for the field forces without the
use of a railroad south of the border
is becoming increasingly difficult. This
question is causing Gen. Funston more
anxiety than any feaure of the expedi
tion. The advanced force has pene
trated more than 250 miles into the
Interior of Chihuahua.
No intimation of any change in the
railroad situation was given at de
partment headquarters early today.
Many officials are convinced that the
success of operations depends on the
use of railroads in the territory.
The long: dispatch from Gen. Per
shing telling of operations in the vic
inity of Namiquipa gives basis for be
lief that in the future he will keep
headquarters mors closely advised of
developments.
CAVALRY VOLUNTEERS.
Chicago, March 27.—The nucleus of
a "provisional" cavalry regiment has
been formed here, it was learned today
and application will be made to the
war department for equipment. The
regiment will be offered the govern
ment for any and all kinds of service,
it is said, and will be made up, largely
as possible, of business men who will
be ready for immediate service.
A call was issued today for a meet
ing of the "rookies" who attended the
training camp at Ft. Sheridan last
summer, with the idea of raising five
provisional regiments of infantry.

NEW CRISIS ON
SUBMERSIBLES
Washington Taking a Grave
View of Latest Activity
of the Submarines
NOU. S. CITIZENS
LOST ON SUSSEX
Partial Proof Secured to
Indicate Torpedo Was
Cause of Disaster
Washington, D. C., March 27.—Amer
ican officials view the submarine situa
tion as taking on aspects of much
gravity. The possibility of breaking
off diplomatic relations with Germany
is again being discussed as one of the
eventualities which is expected to fol
low if it is shown that the steamers
Sussex and Englishman were victims
of sumbarines.
Officials say they are examining all
the facts at hand with open minds and
can come to no conclusion before they
have additional information but there
is an undercurrent of uneasiness over
the possibility that German submarines
have renewed their activities against
passenger carrying ships in violation
of the assurances given to the United
States.
The impression was general that if
it should be established that the ships
were victims of submarines and Presi
dent Wilson decided to take action he
first would consult congress.
American consular officers and the
embassies in France and England are
being urged to gather evidence of a
definite and legal sort. Meanwhile
the situation can only be described as
a waiting one.
Consular Agent Whitman at Bou
logne reported today that he Informed
by French officials that a piece of
bronze, resembling apart of a torpedo,
had been found on the channel liner
Sussex.
State department officials said they
had no information that any other than
German submarines were operating in
the vicinity in which the Sussex was
attacked. All agents in the vicinity
were being urged today to gather con
clusive evidence from all possible
agencies.
Latest official information at the
state department was a dispatch from
the American embassy at London
forwarding affidavits from Edward S.
Huxley and Francis E. Drake, New
York survivors, swearing that the ex
plosion on the Sussex occurred "with
out the slightest warning" and credit
ing the ship's commander with saying
that he saw a torpedo's wake.
Break Means War,
Chairman Stone of the foreign rela
tions committee said after seeing
President Wilson that all facts would
be awaited before action was taken.
While President Wilson and other of
ficials do not underestimate the pos
sibilities ot the new situation, they
realize that breaking off of diplomatic
relations with Germany almost cer
tainly would mean war and for that
reason this step would be carefully
considered.
The president was in communica
tion with Secretary Lansing during
the day and urged speedy gathering
of facts regarding the Sussex and
Englishman.
To Offer Reparation.
It was stated authoritatively here
today that should it be shown that a
German submarine attacked the Sus
sex, Germany would disavow the act,
offer reparation, punish the command
er of the submarine and satisfy the
United States that the act was in vio
lation of instructions.
It was also stated auhorltatively
that the German ambassador, Count
von Bernstorff, was mainly respon
sible for the recent retirement of
Grand Admiral von Tirpitz, who is un
derstood to have been eliminated be
cause of his views on submarine war
fare after Count von Bernstorff had
made certain recommendations to the
imperial chancellor. Von Bethmann
Hollweg.
NO AMERICANS LOST.
Paris, March 27.—Detailed informa
tion gathered by the American em
bassy here indicates that no Ameri
cans lost their lives on the Sussex.
All the Americans whose names
were on the passenger list have now
been accounted for, the embassy
states. It is possible, however, that
there may have been among the pas
sengers some Americans whose names
were not inscribed.
"The calm courage and presence of
mind of Capt. Mouffet filled us all with
admiration," said Madame Wiser Ver
lindem, a survivor of the channel
steamer Sussex.
"Although badly htirt himself, this
fine French officer worked without
ceasing for the safety of the passen
gers. While giving orders he answer
ed all their questions, adding a reas
suring word, declaring that the ship
would keep afloat and advising all who
felt that they had sufficient courage
to remain aboard."

REPORT FROM ATHEN8 IS THAT
OPERATIONS ARE BEING
PUSHED IN EARNEST.
Athens, March 27.—Dispatches from
Salonikl say that the frontier actions,
which had hitherto been considered
merely as trying out operations on the
part of the Bulgarians and Germans,
are now assuming the character of a
general attack against the advanced
line of the allies. Considerable vigor
is being displayed and heavy artillery
is being employed on both sides. It
is said that in both military and diplo
matic circles of the Teutonic allies
there is a belief that the long prophe
sied effort to drive the allies into the
sea has begun. In entente circles
here, while the importance of the in
creasing activity of the Bulgarians and
Germans is not. minimized, there is a
general conviction that they do not
seriously Intend to attempt to capture
Salonikl.
Continuation of a violent bombard

The men were a part of a group of
twelve who were being taken to the

deputies and were riding in a special
car. They were strapped together and
whether they succeeded in getting
these loose or they gave way is not
known. The fact that the men were
gone was first discovered just- before
the train reached -Seymour when one
of the deputies passed down the aisle
and saw the berth curtains blowing out
the windows being open.
Two of the officers left the train at
Seymour and came back to Center
ville, arriving here at 1 o'clock this
afternoon. They found a place along
side the track near Numa, a few miles
weift of here, which looked like itf
might be where they had alighted. All

way have been notified and gjven des

Cornell Denies Request of
Sheriff Cremer for More
Specific Statement
WILL MAKE ORDER IF
COUNSEL NEEDS IT
Does Not Deem Necessary
to Issue Permit for
Access to Books
District Judge' Seneca Cornell today
overruled Sheriff C. C. Cromer's mo
tion for'a more specific statement in
the ouster proceedings Instituted
against him by the state department of
justice.
The part of the motion which asked
for court order allowing the sheriff
or hia attorneys to have access to any
or all of the records, lists and docu
ments pertaining to the action was not
passed on by Judge Cornell. How
ever, he said that should such a thing
be necessary at any time he would im
mediately give a court order to that
effect. He maintained though that
there would be no need' for such an
order as the records are public prop
erty and he felt sure that there would
be no opposition to the sheriff or his
attorneys examining them IK prepara
tion for the trial.
Mr. Cremer's attorneys took excep
tions to the court's ruling on the mtv
tion and were given until Thursday
morning to plead to them. This, it Is
not expected, will conflict with the
trial judge's assignment of the case.
Judge A. N. Hobson of West Union,
who was appointed by Chief Justice
Evans of the state supreme court last
Thursday to hear the action, cannot,

the trial within ten days
of his appointment nor more than
twenty days away. This will probably
bring It during the first or second
week in April.
In ruling on the motion Judge Cor
nell said that he had gone over the
papers very carefully and felt that
when the state set out 179 different
Instances, in which overcharging and
similar work was alleged to have been
committed by the sheriff, the amend
ment compiled with the law and the
court's ruling on the defendant's first
motion for a more specific statement.
He cited the action as being one dif

criminal case in which the points to be
given in a petition are clearly set out.
HIGH DEMOCRATIC
LEADER IS DEAD
Washington, D. C., March 27.—
Thomas J. Pence, secretary of the
democratic national committee, who
had been ill for several months as a
result of pneumonia, died at his home
here early today.
Mr. Pence probably had as extensive
acquaintance among democratic poli
ticians throughout the country as any
man who ever occupied an official po
sition with the national committee.
He was one of the "original WilBon
men."
Mr. Pence was a friend of President
Wilson and was the daily companion
of his secretary, J. P. Tumulty, and of
several prominent administration sen
ators. For many years he was Wash
ington correspondent of the Raleigh,
(N. C.) News and Observer, which Is
owned by Secretary Daniels of the
navy department.
President Wilson was deeply
shocked when told of Mr. Pence's
death and expressed deep regret. With
Postmaster General Burleson and Sec
retary Tumulty, Mr. Pence had.direct
ed all of the detailed political work of
the administration since the president
took office.
MOVIE OPERATORS
IN MURDER FEUD
Chicago, March 27. —The police are
searching today for three men said to
be implicated in the murder last night
of Hugh Coogan. Two suspects are be
ing held. One theory for the murder
as advanced by the police, it Is said, is
that Coogan was killed as the result
of rivalry between two motion picture
operators' unions.
The fact that two theaters were un
damaged by bomb explosions Friday,
said to be the result of the unions'
war, lends strength to the

that
the murder Is an outgrowth of the
