ENTIRE QUESTION MAY BE

WASMlN'riTOV, March CT.?With all
evidence indicating that the Hritish
channel steamer Piis?e\', carrying
American citizens. was the virMin of
a torpedo, it was stated authorita
tively hero to-dav that if a (Jcrmari
submarine made the attack th<! im
perial government would disavow the
act, punish thr. submarine commander,
offer reparation, and satisfy the. United
States that the act was in violation oC
instructions. Thus it seemed to-night
that the issue might narrow down to
the question of whether the Cnited
! States would be r illing to accept such
ja declaration from the Berlin govern
ment.
I President Wilson is awaiting ^ith
[deep concern the receipt of complete
j evidence, not only In regard to the Sus
j sex, aboard which several Americans
?narrowly escaped death: but as to the
? sinking of the British steamship Eng
. lishman. One American life is said in
I tho latest repots to have been lost
j when the Englishman went down.
Already, li was intimated at the
? State Department, the United Sta'es
has information sufficient to warrant
an inquiry of the German government
as to whether any of its submarines
fired a torpedo at the Sussex or the
Englishman.
The President, however, holds tnat
| all the details available should b? at
hand before definite action is taken.
He described the situation to callers
j as being grave, but said no decisive
step would be taken pending the re
ceipt of the additional facts.

cate t lie situation fully to Congress
before taking steps which might lead
to the s?verarce of diplomatic rela
tions. The situation probably will ho
fully discussed at the Cabinet meet*,
ing to-morrow.
Official expression of the attitude
?>f the administration was avoided to
day. but high officials made no attempt
to minimize the gravity of the situa
tion which will confront the United
States if it is established conclusively
that ,i >or*nan submarine Mink tiie
Sussex, an unarmed passenger-carry
itiK vessel, in violation 01 the rights
of humanity, the principles of intor
natioi.al law, and the solemn assur

marine warfare which have been i^iven
to tlie United States by the Central
European powers.

Ambassador Bernstorft is expected to
return to the capital to-morrow, after
an Hbsein-u of several days. Ho prob

la r> I.ansincr soon after his arrival.
It was stated authoritatively that
Von Hernstorft' was mainly responsible
for the recent retirement of Grand
Admiral von Tirpitz. who is understood
to have been eliminated because of his
views on submarine warfare after
Count von Bet nstorff bad made certain
recommendations to the Imperial Chan
cellor. Von Hethmann-Ilidlwev.
The ambassador was advised that
Admiral Tirpitz proposed to conduct a
relentless submarine campaign against
all shipping to British ports, and na.i
asked what, in his opinion, would b?}
the effect of such a campaign upon
neutral nations, particularly the L'nited
Sta tes.
Tito ambassador's reply is sai'l to
have been an important factot in '.ha
retirement of the admiral.
Knowing these facts and the atti
tude of the German government. Teu
tonic officials arc certain that if a sub
marine was concerned in the Sus?ex
disaster the imperial government sx 111

German embassy helioses a mine dam

It was authoritatively stated to-r'.iy
that the President would communicate
the situation fully to Congress ht-fois
taking any detlnite steps which might
lead tv a rupture of diplomatic tela
