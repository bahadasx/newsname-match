Old Warriors Leads Army.
The Indian scouts who will bo sent
to aid General Porshlng are men of
advanced years and who 'fought with
Geronimo, tho Apache chief whoso
flight into Mexico led to tho last ex
pedition across the border by Ameri
can troops. There are a numbor of
the old warriors at the San Carlos
agency, Nov.- Mexico, and Fort Apac.be,
Arizona, who wore In Geronlmo's band
and surrendered with him to General
Lawton in 18S6.
General Scott is personally acquaint

will be possible to find a fow who are
physically capable of taking the trail
despite their years. As hunted men

Administration Takes Action.
Washington, March 2S. Adminis
tration officials today were taking
steps to aid General Funston In over
coming difficulties met with in keep
ing opon a two-hundred and fifty
mllo supply lino to tho American
forces in Mexico.
Realizing that It may require a week
or more to porfect tho proposed
protocol with the dofacto government
covering the use of Mexican railways
and other matters concerning tho In
ternational chase for Villa, officials
were preparing first, to press for
prompt disposition of the railroad re
quest as a separate Issue, and secondly
to send General Funston enough motor
vehicles with which to maintain an
adequate supply system. It Is plan
nod to establish supply depots at In
tervals along the lines or communica
tion ench to bo fed by the one im
mediately in its rear and the border
end of the supply lino to maintain con
stant vigil.
Carranza's suggestions as to modi

Carranza Delay Railroad Question.
In tho meantime, it is said, Carranza
desires to delay replying to tho re

San Antonio, Texas, March 28. The
supply problem continues to overshad
ow all other matters having to do
with the punitive expedition in Mex
ico. Indications from Washington
that railroads will not bo made avail
ablo in tho immediate future camo
as unwelcome news to department
headquarters early today. Because of
the imperative need for rail lines it
had been hoped by offlcors that offi
cials in Washington would find a way
of securing a favorable answer from
General Carranza.
With the railroads closed to him,
General Funston faces tho big prob
lem of supplying General Pershing's
forco for a considerable period by
means of motor transportation and
wagon trains. This means he must
send great quantities of supplies a dis
tance of 250 miles south of tho border
In trucks and wagons through a
country that is a barren waste of
sand.
Two More Companies Needed.
In order to -meet the situation to,
the best of his ability ho has asked
for additional motor trucks. Four
companies a total of 107 trucks
are already in operation and two ad
ditional companies will be added as
quickly as cars can be purchased and
sent to tho border.
General Funston Is expecting a dis

PURSUIT HAMPERED
Motor Trucks Rushed to Co

Operation.
El Paso, Tex., March 28. Tho pur
suit of Pancho Villa may bo ham
pered, if not actually halted, unless
the Mexican railroads nro made
avallablo as tho main line of com
munication with the American army
now advancing into Mexico over two
hundred miles from the border. Mili
tary men expressed that view today
after studying dispatches from the
front and that Villa was still in full
flight southward and meeting with
little, If any, opposition.
Every mile that tho Mexican bandit
advances into the interior Increases
the difficulties of maintaining the al
ready attenuated line of American
communications. Motor trucks aro
being rushed to tho army baso at Co
lumbus, N. 31., to help In keeping up
tho necessary movement of supplies
to tho field headquarters at a point
near Casas Grandes. Every effort Is
being made to contlnuo tho lino of

rocky and sandy trail southward from
Columbus until such time as tho de
facto government gives permission to
uso tho railroads.
Pessimism In Army Circles.
There is much pessimism In army
circles over tho prospects of captur
ing Villa and It Is felt that unless ho
Is cornered within tho week the ban
dit will havo outrun his pursuers and
that months may elapse before tho
outlaw and his band can be ferreted
out of their hiding places in moun
tains. Dispatches from the advance

has been a subsidence of reports that
trouble impends along tho border.
The sound of shooting in tho down

aroused little attention as tho streets
were practically deserted. Flvo sol

SUBMARINE WAR
POLICY DEBATED
Chancellor to Speak Before
German Budget Committee
Position of Dr. Von
Bethmann-Hollweg
Not Enviable.
SEE AMERICAN DANGER
Rupture of Relations With
Such a Powerful Nation
Should Not Be Under
estimated. Amsterdam, March 2S. Via Lon
don, 9:44 a. m. The Vosslscho Zel
tung, discussing continuance of Ger
many's submarine war policy, says:
'The. Imperial chancellor will speak
at one of tho sessions of the budget
committee, which Is to discuss the
resolutions on submarine warfare pro
posed by tho Conservatives, tho Na
tional Liberal and the Centro parties.
He will explain certain questions and
will thoroughly convince the repre
sentatives of the nation. It must be
admitted that a responslblo statesman
Is in a difficult position toward the
great public, for thero are things
which it is impossible to make public,
much less to discuss publicly. In
such a situation tho question of how
much confidence a statesman enjoys
Is of vital importance. Tho near fu
ture will show whether Dr. von Beth
mann Hollweg, the imperial chan
celler, enjoys public confidence and to
what extent. Among tho politicians
of Germany, opinion regarding tho
chancellor is not by any means en-
Tho newspaper declares that mili
tary criticism is not directed against
military commanders or against tho
emperor, but Bolely against the em
peror's advisors. It says:
'Regarding political successes, opin
ions aro divided. Only recently, on
the occassion of the sinking of the
Tubantla, many doubts arose as to
whether what had been accomplished
politically corresponded to uor great
military success."
The Vossische Zeitung adds:
'Tho American danger as viewed In
Gorman political ""circles is alwavs
greatly exaggerated, but the Impor
tance of a rupture of relations with
such a powerful nation should not be
underestimated."
Submarine Situation Grane
Washington, March 2S The United
States has inquired of Germany
through Ambassador Gerard, whether
any of its submarines torpedored tho
British channel steamer Sussex.
Secretary Lansing nnnounced after
the cabinet meeting today that It had
been decided to mako such nn in
quiry and later It was learned that
the inquiry had been made and In fact
probably is already In Berlin.
The present status of communica
tion Is that of an inquiry. It has not
advanced to tho stag of a protest
or a demand.
While cabinet members declared
the situation grave, they took the
opinion that a break with Germany
was not an Immediate prospect. It
was said, however, that if Germany
admitted torpedoing the Sussex, a sit
uation would be brought about which
would be most serious.
Cabinet members agreed that tho
decision would depend much upon
Germany's reply to the American
inqulr. Should Germany deny that
ono of her submarines attacked tho
Sussex, the American government
would reach Its conclusion from the
evidence now' being collected from
Its department representatives abroad.
Cabinet members said tho decision
to make an Inquiry of Germany was
in lino with the policy of collecting
all tho Information before a decision
was reached.
Should Germany admit tho attack
but claim that tho submarine com
mander exceeded his orders, cabinet
members belloved that would be re
garded aa evidence that it was im
practicable for submarine comman
ders to attempt to distinguish bo
tween armed and unarmed vessols.
The possibility that the attack upon
the Sussox might lead up to a general
clearing up of the submarine situa
tion was discussed at tho cabinet
meeting.
Gerard to Make Inquiries.
Washington, March 28. Ambassa
dor Gerard at Berlin has been In
structed to gather information as to
whether a German submarine attack
ed the horse ship Englishman in
American life was lost. Ho probably
will make informally inquiries of the
German government.
Steamer Was Torpedoed.
London, March 28, 4 p. ra. Two
Amorlcan citizens, Arthur Mackenzie
of Savannah, and Tom Fifer of Dela
ware, who were on board the British
steamer Manchester Engineer have
made affidavits before tho American
consul that the steamer waa torpedoed
without notice, according to a Central
News dispatch from Queenstown to
day. London, March 28 9:40 a. ra. Sum
marizing the work' of tho Germans
slnco March 15, when their now pro-
gram of submarine warfare against

Daily Telegraph says that they havo
In leBS than a fortnight sunk 7000
tons of shipnlng of which one-third be
