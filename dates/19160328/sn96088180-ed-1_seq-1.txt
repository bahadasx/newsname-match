army deficiency bill appropriating f 8,-
600,000 to cover the cost of the
American expedition Into Mexico and
enable the war department to recruit
the army to full strength, buy aero
planes, motor trucks and equipment.
Congressman London, socialist, of
New York, was the only member cast
ing a negative rote. The house's ac
tion Is taken as congressional en
dorsement ot the move against Fran
cisco Villa.
The bill provides for eight aero
planes and. It necessary, for 24, and
appropriates 8500,000 for them.
- "There are only eight aeroplanes
In Mexico," said Congressman Mann
today. "There ought to be 80 there."

TO
Spokano, Mar. 28. The problems
of good 'roads and preparedness were
linked today In the Northwest Pre

Mathewson, president of the Good
Roads association and the Automo
bile Association ot Montana, empha
sised the Importance ot a permanent
network of highways for military
purposes.
"Permanont Highways and Good
Roads as a Part of Preparedness,!'
was tho topic to which he was as
signed. As general manager ot the
Anaconda Copper Mining company's
reduction works, Mathewson has In
duced that company to match dollar
for dollar with several counties In
Montnua to build permanent roads.
The notion of tho war department
In ordering army officers not o par

Colouel Poker, though ho spoke as

into tho minds of tho 150 or moro
delegates before the telegram arrived
from' Washington excluding officers

TEUTONS
Campaign Opens Along a
Hundred-Mile Front in At
tempt to Gain Highlands
Before the Spring Hoods
Berlin, Mar. 28. Russian troops
today are renewing ' their attacks
against Field Marshal von Elnden
burg's soldiers on a 100-mlle front.
Hurling themselves again and again
at the barbed wire entanglements ot
the Germans, the Slavs are being
slaughtered In great numbers. They
have not suffered heavier losses since
the memorable retreat from Dunajec
a year ago.
But they must keep on attacking
or admit defeat and retreat.
The spring thaw will soon set In.
Then Hussion lowlands will be flood
ed, and the czar's commanders most
withdraw their entire line.
The Germsns will suffer from floods
also, but they will not be compelled
to withdraw as much as the Rus
sians. Therefore, the Slavs are wast
ing much ammunition In desperate
efforts to seise higher positions be
fore spring freshets turn their
trenches into muddy ditches and
make' their camps Into a vast swamp.
Despite the fury of repeated Rus
sian charges, German officers are con
fldent their line will be held Intact.
One German officer wrote relatives
here that Russian marksmanship was
very poor. '
So strong ere the Teuton defenses
that this officer wrote his battalion
lost only two killed and 17 wounded
when the Slavs came on behind a
curtain ot terrific explosions.
Formerly one Russian officer was
found among every 800 privates cap
tured, on the average. Now, how
ever, the ratio is one officer to every
60 rankers.
S AS Atl AID
Ml
Spokane, Mar. 28. In a paper sent
to the Northwest Conference on Pre
paredness, and read by the chairman
today, Senator Miles Polndexter
urged that the recommendation for
an Increase In the navy made by the
naval board be followed as far as
possible. ' ' ' " ' '" i
"A practical proposition, however,"
said the paper, "is -the most we can
obtain at this session. This probably
will bo the adoption of the five-year
building program recommended by
Presldept Wilson and Secretary of
the Navy Daniels. ,
"It Is to be hoped that by some In
ternational agreement which must be
proposed and conducted by the exe
cutive branch of government, we can
come to some agreement with foreign
nations for limitation ot naval arma
ments on some basts that would leave
the United States In a relatively good
position,
, "Without such an agreement, It Is
the height of folly for the 'United
Rtntes to proceed alono and without
regard to Internal lonnl conditions to
limit Us own naval armament on the
theory that there Is to be no further
use of naval power. , ' , (
"Under the circumstances," con
cluded Polndextor, "unless we have
requisite naval strength, we. can not
maintain peace even by the surrender
of our most priceless national privi
leges." . ''' ,., '
