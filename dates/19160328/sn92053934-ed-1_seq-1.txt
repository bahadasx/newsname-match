Information on Two Latest;
Sea Disasters Reflects
on Germany.
SPLIT NOT UNLIKELY
Severance of Diplomatic Re
lations With Berlin Is
Again in Question.
Washington, March 28.
The United States has in
quired of Germany, through
Ambassador Gerard, wheth
er any of its submarines tor
pedoed the British channel
steamer Sussex. Secretary
Lansing announced after the
cabinet meeting today that it
had been decided to make
such an inquiry and later itlthe hal1 10 the apartments of Mr. and
was learned that the inquiry
had been made and in fact
probably is already in Berlin.
The present status of the
communication is that of an
inquiry; it has not advanced
to the stage of a protest or a
demand.
London, March '2S (4:20 p. m.)
Two American citizens, Arthur
Mackenzie, oi Savannah and Tom

board the British steamer Man

affidavits before the American con

a Central ws dispatch from
(Jueenstoflu today.
situation i:k;ai:iki grave.
Washington, March 28. As Presi
dent Wilson and his cabinet met to
day, members reflected the view that
the submarine situation was grave but
indicated that no decided action would
be taken by the American government
until it was shown conclusively that
the steamers Sussex and Englishman j
were sunk by submarines. i
Although the majority of the cabi
net members present thought the Sus
sex had been torpedoed, some agreed
that the position of the United States
would be surrounded with difficulty
unles- the sinking of the vessel were
admitted or unless overwhelming evi
dence should be developed.
Secretaries Lane. McAdoo and Dan
iels were not present.
Situation Grate.
All evidence thus far received re
lating to the sinking of the steamship
Englishman and the damaging of the
Sussex by explosion with American
citizens aboard, was assembled at the
state department today ready for
submission to the cabinet. President
Wilson and his advisers were to go
over all phases of the situation, which
Is described as grave.
While all the evidence at hand in
dicates that the steamers were tor
pedoed without warning with pos
sible loss of one American on the
Englishman and injuries to several
Americans on the Sussex, President
Wilson is awaiting receipt of positive
Proof before taking definite action.
It is stated authoritatively that if a
German submarine fired the torpedoes
whirh sank the Englishman and dam
aged the Sussex, Germany would dis
avow the act. The issue, therefore,
seemed to come down to the question
of whether the Washington govern
ment would be willing to accept such
a declaration.
Amsterdam, (via London, March 28,
9:4S a. in.) The Vossische Zeitung,
discussing the future of Germany's
submarine warfare policy, says:
"The Imperial chancellor will speak
at one of the sessions of the budget
committee, which is to discuss the res
olutions on submarine warfare pro
Posed by the conservative, the national
liberal and the centre parties. He will
explain certain questions and will per
haps thoroughly convince the repre
senta'ives of the nation. It must be
admitted that a responsible statesman
Is in a difficult position toward the
great public, for there are things
'hicu it is impossible to make public,
much less to discuss publicly."
The Vossische Zeitung says:
"The American danger, as viewed in
German political circles, is always
Sreatly exaggerated, but the impor
tance of a rupture of relations with
Men a powerful nation should not be
u&dtre-sumaled."

STUDENTS STRIKE
Iowa City, Iowa, March 2S. Stu
dents at the state university here to
day said a movement probably would
be started for self-government for the
L'niversity student body as the result
of the suspension of 12 members of the
University junior promenade. The
suspended students are charged with
infraction of a university rule of long
standing. Parents of several of the

and some of the suspended collegians
are attending their classes daily, re
sisting the suspension order.
THE WAR
TODAY
British Infantry by charges
and the explosion of a bis
mine have captured German
trenches along a front of 600
yards in the region of Llol.
The bombardment northeast
and northwest of Ycrdiin and in
the Woevre region southeast of
the fortress again has become in
tense but the infantry of both
sides are idle, apparently awaiting
the opportune moment for an at
tack. The Germans also are keeping
up the bombardment of Bethin
court, Le Mort Jlonime and Cum
ieres, west of the Meuse and
French positions in the region of
A'aux and Douaumout.
The Russians have captured
two lines of German trenches
northeast of Postavy and are still
pursuing the Turks in the Black
sea region.
The .Austrian have captured
an Italian position near Gorlzla.
At Washington the possibility
of breaking off diplomatic rela
tions with Germany is being dis
cussed, in the event that the
steamers Sussex and Unclishmah
are shown to have been torped
oed by a German submarine. All
the Americans on board the Sus
Hex were saved bnt several were
injured. One American is believed
to have been lost when the Eng
lishman went down.
Four more vessels have been
sunk by German submarines.
Bitter fighting is again takinir

Field Headquarters, Amer

Colonia Dublan, Chihuahua,
March 28 (hy wireless to
Columbus, N. M.) Prepara
tions for closing in on Fran
cisco Villa in a quick, thor
oughly prepared cavalry
drive, were being pushed f or
iward rapidly today at the
field headquarters of Briga
dier General Pershing, expe
ditionary commander.
AVasiiington, March 28. A
memorandum to General Carran
za pressing for an immediate re
ply to rhe request for permission
to use Mexican railroads in sup
plying American troops in pur
suit of Villa was prepared today
at the state department. It will
be forwarded to Queretoro prob
ably late today.
RAID AM V. RIC AXJBA Si C'H.
There was" "a very noticeable In-"
crease in the tension along the border
today following the reported raid last
night on the ranch of C. E. Kelly, for
mer mayor of El Paso, by Mexican
bandits. The ranch is 32 miles east
of here and a mile and a half from
the border.
The alarm was given first by L. X.
Barker, foreman of the Kelly ranch,
who saw a number of mounted Mex
icans cross the river and attempt to
drive off 100 head of cattle belonging
to Mr. Kelly. Word was immediately
sent to the troops on patrol duty at
Fabens and Ysleta. Two detachments
of the Eighth cavalry, accompanied
by four Texas rangers, were immed
iately sent in pursuit of the raiders.
After three hours search they returned
to camp and Captain Moses reported
to General Bell that nothing had been
seen of the Mexicans and that he be
lieved the whole affair to be a false
alarm. Barker, however, insisted on
the truth of his story.
The reported raid serve to give a
fresh start to the alarming reports
about the attitude of the Mexicans and
conditions in the interior.
"o Relief From Capital.
Matters were not bettered by the
news from Washington that General
t'arranza had again deferred a decis
ion on the question of permitting the
used of Mexican railroads for the
transportation of supplies to the
American troops in the field.
Army officers here admit freely that
the question of the railroads is be
coming an increasingly serious one.
General Pershing's columns have al
ready penetrated more than 250 miles
Into Chihuahua. Every additional mile
that separates them from their base
at Colurnbus enormously adds to the
difficulty in providing them with ade
quate supplies, as the present system
of motor transportation Is now taxed
to its utmost.
Disaffection Humors l'crsist
The uneasiness over the situation is
far from lessened by the persistent re
ports that portions of the Carranza
soldiers are becoming disaffected and
that some of the soldiers of the de fac
to government have already thrown
in their lot with Villa.
The border believes that affairs are
rapidly reaching a crisis and that it
will not be many days before it is defi
nitely established whether or not Gen
eral Carranza can bring about genuine
cooperation with the United States in
the pursuit of Villa.
Villa Fleeing Southward.
Itispatches from the front stated that
Villa still was in full flight southward
and meeting with little if any opposi

NEIGHBOR BROWN PRACTICES HIS NEW
MICHIGAN IS STILL
IN FLOOD'S GRIP
Conditions Brought By High Waters
Believed Most Serious in More
Than a Decade.
Detroit, Mich., March 2S. Southern
Michigan today was menaced by flood
conditions which in ' some sections
wjre the most serious in a dozen
years. A two days rain coming im
mediately after a snowfall which
averaged nearly a foot in depth, sent
rivers and creeks out of their banks
in jiractically the whole state south of
the Straits of Mackinac.
The situation in the Saginaw river
valley probably was the most danger
ous today. Bay City, at the mouth of
the river and Saginaw, about 15 miles
up stream, were threatened with
further inundation by the flood
waters pouring into the Saginaw from
a dozen tributaries. In some of these,
ice gorges were being dynamited.
At Flint the Flint river and Thread
creek continue to rise and several
manufacturing plants were seriously
hampered.
The Michigan Central and Detroit
and Mackinac railroads were unable
to run trains north of Bay City, their
tracks being washed out in numerous
places.
In Lansing the Grand river was
spreading out and crippling industrial
plants. The Kalamazoo river and Bat
tle creek were slowly rising.
Minor damage has been reported
from various other points but so far
there has been no loss of life.

TENNIS STROKE
ANDES IS VICTOR
OVER TEUT CRAFT
British Converted Cruiser Given the
Credit for Sinking of German
Haider Grief.
London, March 28. The British con
verted cruiser Andes gets the credit
for sinking the German raider Greif
in the North Sea Feb. 29 in additional
details of the battle published today.
After the British armed merchant ship
Alcantara had engaged the Greif and
been rendered helpless by a shell
which shattered her rudder, one of her
consorts, the Andes, appeared and
made it impossible for the Greif to
escape. Shells swept the deck of the
German raider, driving the men from
some of her guns.
The raider fired several torpedoes,
which the Andes escaped through skill
ful handling. While thus engaged a
third British vessel of the light cruiser
type Joined in the action.
But the Andes had the Greif afire
fore and aft and the raider blew up
with a terrific explosion, the theory
being that she carried a cargo of mines
which ignited when the fire reached
them.
QUASH BILLS ON
STEEL MEN CASE
Youngstown, Ohio, March 28.
Judge W. S. Anderson today granted
the motion to quash the indictments
recently held here against five steel
companies, charging them with con
spiring to fix the price of labor and
steel products. The indictments
against the United States Steel cor
poration and E. II. Gary, head of the
corporation, still stand, as the motion
to quash did not include these two
defendants on whom service has not
been secured. The steel company at
torneys attacked the indictments as
being too indefinite and uncertain, de
priving the defendants of their con
stitutional rights.
