COLUMBIA, MISSOURI,
STUDENTS WILL VOTE
ON HAZING ABGLITIGN
M.U. Council to Put Ques
tion Before Body at Mass
Meeting Soon.
NEW ELECTION PLAN
Adoption of Changed Form
of Preferential Ballot to
Be Considered.
Hazing of freshmen is on its way
to a quiet death, if the students of the
University desire to put a stop to it.
This is the statement of members of
the Student Council, who in session
yesterday afternoon voted to present
a resolution to the student body abol
ishing all forms of freshman "perse
cution." A meeting of the student body will
be called some time before the Easter
holidays by E. C. Mead, student presi
dent. A committee was appointed yes
terday to draft resolutions on the haz
ing question. These will be presented
to the students for a vote. Every stu
dent in tho University will be asked
to co-operate in putting an end to
hazing and members of this year's
freshman class probably will be asked
to pledge themselves not to haze next
year's first-year men. The .Student
Council believes that if the students
determine that hazing shall end no
trouble will be found in enforcing the
rule.
Coming Election Discussed.
The coming spring election, at which
next j ear's student president and other
officers will be chosen, also came in
for a good share of discussion by the
council. It was decided that every
effort would be made this year to keep
the supporters of tho various candid
ates, loaded with cards and "reasons,"
away from the polls.
A new system cf preferential voting
was drawn up, to be presented to the
student body for a vote. This system,
which the council hopes will be used
at the coming election, is as follows:
Each voter. If there be three candidates
for the same office, shall vote for a first
and second choice. Indicating his choice
by numbering 1 and 2.
If there be more than three candidates.
each voter slull ote for first, second and
third choices in order, 1, 2 and 3.
The members of the Student Council
shall count the votes in the following
ma ner: The first chokes of all ballots
shill be counted, and the one receiving a
majority of all llrt choices shall be de
clared -elected.
Will Eliminate Lowest.
If no one recehes a maloritv of the first
choices, the candidate standing lowest shall
le dropped and his first choice ballots
shall be distributed among the remaining
candidates according to the second choices
expressed tncreon.
If no one has yet received a majority
of all the votes cast, again the lowest man
shill be dropped and his first choices dis
tributed among the candidates remaining,
according to the second choices expressed
eti bis ballots, or if any of the second
chokes have been dropped, according to
tLe third choices.
This process shall continue until one
candidate shall have received a majority.
In which case he shall be declared elected,
or until the candidates are reduced to
two, in which case the one having the
highest number of votes shall be declared
elected.
This Is How It Will Work.
Here is an illustration of how the
system works:
A, IS, C and D are running; out of 2,
000 ballots cast, 900 express first choice
for A, 000 for B, 330 for C and 250 for D.
No one has a majority, as 1.001 votes re
quired. D is dropped and his votes are
redistributed among the others, according
to the second choices on D's ballots.
Suppose D's ballots ran thus: 103 second
choices for A, 0T for B, 50 for C. Totaling
the votes. A has 1.003. B C97 and C 400.
A, baring n majority, is elected.
Library Delinquents Posted.
That students might feel more keen
ly the importance of returning
library books and paying fines prompt
ly, H. O. Severance, University librar
ian, today adopted the plan of posting
the names of delinquents on the
library bulletin board. No name will
be made public until after one notice
has been sent to tho student telling
him that a fine has been assessed.
Xew Plnmbtag Firm Here.

the County Court room at the court
house to work on the final plans for

I J. G, BABB CROWNED
KING OFSPELLEHS
Doughty Orthographer Brings
Victory to J. N. Belcher's
Cohorts.
BY NARROW MARGIN
Mrs. J. I. Clark Gives the
Winner a Hard Tussle
in Closing Rounds.
CAX T0U SPELL THESE?
Some who were spelled down
and tho words that caused their
fall:
E. M. Watson, tenement.
Miss Pearle Mitchell, mortise.
N. T. Gentry, magnanimity.
Judge J. T. Rowland, mag
nanimity. C. O. Hanes, negotiate.
H. H. King, philanthropy.
The Rev. G. W. Hatcher, phi
lanthropy. Mrs. J. E- Thornton, battalion.
J. N. Belcher, caoutchouc.
C. G. Ross, belles-lettres.
J. M. Woods, licentiate.
Mrs. J. I. Clark, disseize.
J. G. Babb, spelled 'em all.
The cream of Columbia's spelling
talent gathered at the Stephens Col
lege Audiliori n last night and en
gaged in an old-fashioned spelling bee.
The match ended with E. 51. Watson's
cohorts as whipped cream, his team
going down In defeat before the su
perior orthography of J. N. Belcher's
well-trained Epellers.
The two captains arrived early on
the scene to get tho best spellers for
themselves. They watched the door
clcsely for tho first chance at any re-
pu ed speller that entered, as well as
to Keep any of their side from de
serting. The trojan activities of the
leaders will linger long In the memory
of those who saw the match. They
wandered nervously through the au
dience, trying to detect the good spell
ers by the style of their headdress or
the cut of their vests. After events
vindicated the rare judgment of Mr.
Belcher.
3Ir. Babb and His Book.
J. G. Babb, the individual star of
the meet, arrived late. He was seen
putting a small, dark-covered book in
his pocket as he entered the audi
torium. From time to time during the
delay that preceded the match, he re
ferred cautiously to this mysterious
book.
Miss Pearle Mitchell Introduced the
captains of the competing teams as
"champion spellers from a long time
ago." Both the accused protested that
"it w asn't such a long time ago." Miss
V jhell then retracted the statement
l d admitted that it couldn't have
been so very long ago, because she
could remember it herself.
But the match itself. Mr. Belcher
won the toss and chose J. G. Babb.
Then the captains alternately chose
until there were seventeen on each
side. J. E. McPherson pronounced
the words from an old blue-back spell
ing book.
On the first round Miss Mitchell
put a "c" in "mortise" and was com
pelled to take her seat On the
second round, E. M. Watson, captain
and strong bulwark of his team, ner
vously fingered his Phi Beta Kappa
key and went down inglorlously on
"tenement"
Then the Real Tongue-Twisters.
After this, college professors, high
school students, townspeople. Univer
sity students and college girls hesi
tated, stammered and missed words
until only eleven remained standing.
"Synecdoche" proved the downfall
of four. "Billet-doux," "gherkin,"
"knaggy" and "chicanery" made the
contest one of rapid and ruthless
elimination until there were but two
standing on each side. Mr. Belcher
and Mr. Babb opposed Mrs. J. I. Clark
and Mr. Ross.
Mr. Ross slipped up on "belles
lettres," leaving Mrs. Clark as the
sole defender of her side's honor. The
heretofore Impregnable Mr. Belcher
was bewildered by the maze of vow
els, consonants and diphthongs in the
word that sounds like a sneeze and
Is spelled "caoutchouc." When he sat
down, there followed an unexampled
exhibition.
Mr. Babb and Mrs. Clark marshalled
the twenty-six letters of the alpha
bet and for ten minutes withstood all
efforts of the master, Mr. McPherson,
with the aid of the old blue-back, to
turn them down. Finally the word
disseize" was given to Mrs. Clark,
SIX PAGES
e, except after c." made the' fatal mTs!j
take which gave victory to Mr. Babb
and Captain Belcher's team.
The. greatest disappointment of the
evening was the inability of Captain
Watson to present the proper orthog
raphy for the word "tenement" It is
believed that the downfall of Mr. Wat
son portended the defeat of his side
and gave victory to the side captained
by Mr. Belcher.

"Folk's room was flooded with tele

Playground Apparatus.
The Lee School pupils are now the
enthusiastic participants in real play

teeters, swings and horizontal bars,
two basketball courts, a baseball dia
mond, a slide and a giant stride, which
make up the equipment, teachers havo
no trouble getting the children to exer
cise. The apparatus Is now being used.
Tho pupils of tho lower grades uso
one set of the teeters, swings and bars,
while those pupils in tho higher
grades make uso a larger set of their
own. The giant stride and the siiuo
arc used by all the pupils.
So far, the slide has been tho most
popular part of the equipment. It
has been the unsuccessful coasting
place for a wagon owned by one of
the neighboring small boys and has
been the successful place for head
first dives and backward and forward
sitting rides.
The playgrounds were installed, un
