SUSSEX INCH
AMERICA IN
It Has Been Established By
the State Department that
No American Lost His Life
On Board Channel Steamer.
LOSS OF BOAT MAY
PRECIPITATE TROUBLE
President and Lansing Are
Plainly Worried Over the
Situation. Germany May
Be Asked to Explain.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON. March 27.
With all evidence indicating that
the British channel steamer Sus
sex, carrying American citizens,
was the victim of a torpedo, it was
'stated authoritatively here to
night, that if a German submarine
made the attack, the imperial
government would disavow the
act, punish the submarine com
mander, offer reparation and satis
fy the I'nited States that the act
was in violation of instructions.
Thus it seemed tonipht that the
issue might narrow oowu to the
question of whether the United
stiles would be willing to accept
such action by the German gov
ernment. President Wilson is
awaiting, with deep concern, the
receipt of conclusive evidence
not only in connection with the
Sussex, but as to the sinking of
the British steamer Englishman..
One American life is said to have
been lost when the Englishman
went down.-
Already it was intimated at the
state department, the United
States has in its possession infor
mation sufficient to warrant the
making of an inquiry of the Ger
man government as to whether
any of its submarines fire a tor
pedo at the Sussex or the English
man. The president holds the opinion
that all the details available
shou!3 ie at hand before definite
a.-tioa of any kind is take"1 He
tltscrihed the situation to callers
as beii'g grave but said no decis
ive step would lie taken pending
the receipt of additional facts.
It is known that the President
is seriously considering going be
fore Congress and laying the en
tire question of submarine warafre
before that body. , : ; '
Certainly he will communicate
the situation in full to Congress
"before taking cny definite steps
which might lead to the severance
of diplomatic relations.
All phsses of the situation prob
ably will be discussed at the cab
inet meeting tomorrow.
Official expression of the atti
tude of the administration whs
avoided today but high officals
made no attempt to minimize the
situation which will confront the
United States if it is established
conclusively that a German sub
marine sank the Sussex an un
armed, peaceful passenger carry
ing vessel in violation of rights of
humanity the principles of inter
na'ional law and the solemn as
surances of regarding the conduct
of submarine warfare which have
been given to the I'nited States
by the Central European powers.
President Wilson was in con
stant communication with Secre
tary Ijinstng during the day and
all reports received from consular
agents and .diplomatic represen
tatives were sent to the White
House as soon as they were re
ceived. Among the President's callers
was Chairman Stone of the Sen
ate committee on foreign rela
tions. Count von Bernstorff, the Ger
man ambassador, who was chief
ly responsible for the retirement
of' Grand Admiral Von Tirpitz
has been out of town for several
days, but is expected to return to
the capitol tomorrow. He prob
ably will communicate with Sec

Repetition of Disastrous 1913 Floods
(8y Review Leased Wire.)
C01 I'MBl'S, Ohio, March 27. Less
than two feet of levees tonight was
holding the rising waters of the Scioto
River, preventing a flood which earlier
in the day hal threatened to equal
that of lfll3. Thousands of persons
moved from their homes to higher
ground. Chances tonight favored a
passing of the floods crest without a
break in the levees. Cessation of to
day's downpour in the upper Scioto
Valley and the coming of slightly cold
weather quited the anxiety of the 30,
000 residents of lowlands in this city.
Normal business and school sessions
are suspendid in the district threaten
ed, while residents carried their house
fumichines to second stories, moved
them hastily in vans to places of safe
ty or fled across the river with only
tlirir personal belongings.
Amtulantes sped through the streets
all day carrying invalids and prospec
tive mothers from the west side to
hospitals or homes of friends in high

Manner in Which Bandit Got
Away from the Region of
Namiquipa Brings Suspicion
Upon First Chief's Efforts.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
SAN ANTONIO, March 27. Fran
cisco Villa"s escape from the region
about Namiquipa following his victory
over a part of the Mexican troops,
was unopposed by other detachments
of the de facto government forces, ac
cording to unofficial but credible re
ports reaching here today.
The cordon of troops that the Mex
ican authorities announced . should
have been drawn across his path,
gave ways according to' these reports,;
with, a willingness that indicated their
cooperation with him rather than with
the American forces. v I
Army men here are inclined to be-
lieve reports of inefficiency and half- i
hearted cooperation. Reports from
General Pershing to Gen. Funston
dealt only with routine subjects, prin
cipally having to do with the tran
sporting of supplies. The positions of
troops were not revealed but it was
known that the cavalrymen were still
riding hard along the track left by
Villa. Officers of the quartermaster's
department studied the best methods
of getting provisions, especially sup
pliri lor the horses and mules, to the
field army, while Gen. Ftinston and j
his staff - anxiously studied the may,
referring frequently to the scale ofj
nines mai snowea ine auvanceu cav
alry columns rapidly Hearing points
Sl0 miles away from the border.
It was realized here that the early
capture of Villa would be little bet
ter than an accident.
Villa and his followers, it is stated,
will have no dillic-ulty in keeping
ahead of the pursuing Americans.
Their hope for an early ending of the
chase is that Carranza troops will
finally check Villa. s flight or that
Villa himself, after poining one or
more of his wandering bands in south
ern Chihuahua or from nothern Du
rango, may decide to fight It out with
the steadily advancing cavalry of the
punitive force.
That Villa will be able to effect a
juncture with a considerable force
before he U brought to a stand is re
garded at headquarters here probable.
Canuto Reyes, one of his generals,
who has been operating in the vicini
ty of Torreon, is known to have ex
ceedingly mobile force that is by no
means negligible and in the state of
Durango it is said the Arrieta broth
ers are in a position to move north
ward to his support.
Unofficial observers have offered a
theory, regarded as somewhat fanci
ful by American military men, that
Villa, after joining these and others,
will continue his movement to the
south with hope of gathering strength
as he goes and with Zapata1 and other
enemies of the Carranza government,
attempt once more to gain possession
of Mexico City. Although this theory
is little credited at headquarters,' it
is realized that he probably can go
about as far as he like now without
seeing an American soldiers for many
weeks.
General Funston will continue his
headquarters here, althought it is
probable that he will go to El Paso,
a few days for a brief stay.
