COOPER SAYS CROPS
ARE NOT DAMAGED
O. C. Cooper, agricultural agent to.'
Grady county, stated that he did not
think the slight frosts of Sunday

had done seme damage to the fruit
and corn in some places had been
covered too deep by the mud washing
over it, thereby necessitating some
replanting.
Mr. Cooper slated that there were
n ore farmers In Chlckasha on Mon
day than he had seen on any day ex
cept "first Mcnday" for many
n.onths. All these gentlemen report
ed, seeding well advanced and said
that the rains had come most oppor
tunely to help out the growing wheat
which, in some localities was begin
ning to suffer to some extent through
lack ot moisture.

COFFMAN
Crusade is Launched by Mayor, to Be
Backed by City Council; Toilet Con

Before May 1
Chickasha must be a sanitary town,
according to the statement made this
morning by Mayor Coffman. No filtb
and disease-breeding nbices wiil be

Mayor Coffman will ask tho city

"All toilets not connected by that
date," said Mayor. Coffman this morn
ing, "wiif be nailed up and those who
fail to comply with the orders to con
nect will be handled according to law.
It might be well to state, In this con
nection, that the laws governing such
rases catch the tenant as well as the
property owners and they will have
their choice of cleaning up, In case
their landlords refuse to do so, or cf
moving. .
"The general clean-up order covers
everything. In addition to the sewer
connections called for in the district
named above, the entire city shall and
must be kept clear and clean of
trash and filth ot all kiuds. This
means that all accumulated dirt and
mud shall be cleared away from tho
streets, the sidewalks and other

Cleared from tho streets and all rub
bish away from the alleys and the va
cant and the other lots.

rubbish or waste at any point inside
the city's limits. I have the assur
ance of the members of the city coun
cil that they will co-operate with mo
in this matter and the chief of police

no typhoid germs shall be the slogan
of Chickasha this summer."

GIGANTIC
SLAUGHTER
FORECAST
British Military Experts Say Next Five
Months Will See Bloodiest Battles
in World's History Fought
' on Both Fronts
ATTACK IS SUICIDE FOR
FIRST LINE TROOPS
Only Reserves Can Expect to Reach Cov
eted Position; , Aerial Conflicts and
Submarine Activity are Also
Likely to Increase
By Wilbur S. Forrest.
United Press Staff Correspondent.
London, March 13. (By Mail.)
Men who have been in closest touch
ith every move of the world war to
date are beginning to forecast that i
the next five months will bring an
unparalleled burst of battle, attended
by the worst bloodshed in the world's
history.
The immense waste of human life
and, materials before Verdun, greater
than that which shocked the world at
Liege and Namur, has demonstrated,
the exports say, that if this war goes
on to the bitter end, no phase of his.
tpry, ancient, medieval or modem,
will compare with the slaughter. One
military critic 'said today:
"The almost Impreguable character
o! the defenses of the western front,
which have been building for eigh
teen months, make it suicide for the
first line of any assaulting body of
troops. When a commander orders a
xttuiion to the assault and posts the
reserves in the rear ready to follow,
he knows that the position attacked
will be captured by the reserves. If
captured at all.
"He cannot help but know in ad-,
ranee that the first line will melt
away before the fire of the opposing
side. Before the reserves reach their
objective over the bodies of their
comrades, they too, may have been
decimated by the machine gun, rifle
and cannon fire , which protects the
trenches on every mile of the front
that runs from the North Sea to
Switzerland.
"No one can blame the command
ers for the course they are bouncf to
teke. It Is war. The men, too, arc
not unwilling to make the sacrifice.
Those in the front ranks know that
their chance Is slim. The best they
can ask for is a wound from which
they wll! ultimately recover. Months
of monotonous trench warfare are re
sponsible for this. The men are will
ing and ready for anything that
means a diversion from the stale
mate of the past year ard a half.
"WTiat will hnppen on the western
front will be repeat. I on th-5 eastern
v.here both the Russians and Ger
tt.nns have been wcrking feverishly
for months entrenching, fortifying,
constructing wire entatifienents and
plicfng heavy ordnf.neo pieces suffi
cient to sweep the ground for mllci
afund."
At Sa'.onlca. where the allies hur
riedly dug themsel-e:' an nave
gradually fortified their holdi gs to
almost impregnah iMy, tho cost of
taking the Greek ji.irt fo? th. central
powers would far ox'Ved Its mtUlaiy

Throughout all the tVeaters, Oil

activity of tho wv ftttended by th
slaughter which conditions maVe In
evitable, the mil'Uiry experts aro say
ing. Nor will' the slaughter be Hniiteif
to soldiers, some forecasts declare.
It is believed in some circles that
Zeppelins will take heavy toll of "dr
iiien populations !n many ouartors.
Reports from Friedriehshafen, on
Lftke Constance, say that the Zeppe
lin factory there is turning out twelve
or sixteen Zeppelins a month. The
German Parseval and Schultz-LAng9
factories, located elsewhere also are
reported active to an extent of ten
times their normal output
