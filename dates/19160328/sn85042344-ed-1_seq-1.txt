WASHINGTON. March 27. Fail
ure of senate Itepublicans to
take any action at a conference today
on the Mexican situation left the ad
ministration unhampered in dealing
with the problem.
The conference was called with the
purpose of considering steps to force
the dispatch of additional troops to
the border for patrol duty. In the
face of official advices denying alarm
ing reports, however, of General Fun
ston's apparent confidence that he has
enough men for any present emergen
cy, the Republicans adjourned with
some of their leaders agreeing that
there was nothing to do but support
the administration's plans at this time. ,
Official advices confirmed press!

ficulties encountered by General Fun-
ston in keeping a two ntinarea mne
supply Une In operation without the
use of railroads. While there is no
shortage of food or other supplies for
the troops at the . front, cavalry
mounts already are on short rations,
.Agreement. Far Off.
Steps to meet the situation have
been taken by Secretary Baker as
there is no indication of an early
agreement on the part of tho proposed
protocol providing for the use of Mex
ican lines by American troops. Mr.
Maker Issued this statement late today:
"All information the department ,
has from the border shows conditions!
to bo quiet and tho excitement of the,
last few days somewhat allayed. Wo
huve no dispatches indicating uctuul
conflict between American soldiers
and any forces of any kind In Mexico. I
"Tho expedition is, of course, mov-
Ing forward and so lengmening me
line of communication. For that rea
son General Funston has requested
and the department has purchased
two additional auto truck equipments
comprising fifty-four cars in all. ' In
addition to that General Funston
tells us that additional aeroplanes will
be of service, both In reconnaissance
work and In carrying messuges from
the advance column to the base at
Columbus. Of tho aeroplanes already
there two have been destroyed. Oth
ers have need of replacing parts but
two of them are in actual continuous
action. The department is now nego
tiating for the purchase of additional
aeroplanes, but neither the number
nor type has been yet determined.
Course Is Not Known.
"Wireless communication is re
ported to be Intermittent, because of
the static conditions in the electric
field there. For this reason additional
Importance to the request forlarger
aeroplane equipment."
The secretary said the destruction
of two army aeroplanes had not been
explained as yet to the department.
Four of the remaining six machines
on tho border were under repair,
leaving only two of the original eight
in actual service. The army has
plenty of skilled aviators to operate
the machines that will be purchased,
Mr. Baker added. He said that while
the aero club had volunteered the
services of its men and machines the
law forbade their acceptance.
The negotiation of a protocol cover
ing use of the Mexican railways and
other matters beyond the border en
countered a delay today with the re
ceipt of General Carranza's sugges
tions as to modifications and additions
