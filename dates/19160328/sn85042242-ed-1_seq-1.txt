Sinking of Sussex and English­
man Produces Grave Situa­
tion.
GERMANY READY TO
MAKE REPARATION
Imperial Government Promises to
Conduct Investigation of
Affair.
Washington, March ,27.—With all
evidence indicating that the British
channel steamer, Sussex, carrying
American victims to watery graves, it
was stated authoritatively here today
that, if a German submarine made the
attack, the Imperial government,
would disavow the act, punish the sub­
marine commander, offer. renaration,
and satisfy the United States that the
act was in violation of instructions.
Thus, it seemed tonight that the
issue might narrow down to the ques­
tion of whether the United States
would be willing to accept such a de­
claration from the Berlin government.
President Wilson is waiting with
deep concern the receipt of conclus­
ive evidence, not only in regard to
the Sussex, aboard which the Ameri­
cans narrowly escaped death, but the
sinking of the steamer, Englishman.
One American is said, in the latest
oflicial reports, to have been lost
when the. Englishman went down.
To Make Inquiry.
Already it was intimated at the
slate department, the United States
has in its possession sufficient infoi
ination to warrant making an inquiry
of the German government as to
whether any of its submarine iired a
torpedo at I lie Sussex or Englishman.
The president' described the situa­
tion to callers during the day as be­
ing grave, but said no decisive slep
would lie taken pending
ilie additional facts. is knbwi'i tit
the president ia. seriously considering
going before congress and laying the
entire question of .submarine warfare
before the house and senate members.
Situation Is Grave.
Oflicial expressions of the adminis­
tration's attitude was avoided today,
but llie officials made no attempt to
minimize the gravity of the situation
which will confront the United States
if it is established that the submarine
sunk the Sussex, an armed peaceful
passenger carrying vessel, in violation
of I he rights of humanity, the prin­
ciples of international law, and the
solemn assurances regarding the con­
duct of the submarine submarine war­
fare which have been given tin* Unit­
ed States by the Central European
powers.
To Make Reparation.
It was stated authoritatively here
today that should it be shown that a
German submarine attacked the Sus­
sex, Germany would disavow the act,
offer reparation, punish the submar­
ine commander, and satisfy the Unit­
ed States that the act was in viola­
tion of instructions.
It was also stated authoritatively
that the German ambassador, Count
von Bernstorff, was mainly respon­
sible for the recent retirement of
Grand Admiral von Tirpitz, who is
understood to have been eliminated
because of his views on the submar­
ine warfare after Count von Bern­
storff had made certain recomnfsnda
tions to the Imperial Chancellor von
Bethmann Holleweg.
Washington Excited.
Washington is waiting with some
anxiety the investigation into the ex­
plosion of the steamer, Sussex, and
the sinking of the British steamer,
Englishman. The possibility of
breaking off diplomatic relations with
Germany is being discussed in the
event the steamers are shown to have
been torpedoed by a German submar­
ine.
All Americans aboard the Sussex
were saved, but several were injured.
One American is believed to have
been lost when the Englishman went
down.
Four more vessels have been sunk
by German submarines, the most im­
portant of them being the British
steamer, Manchester Engineer.

Columbus, O., March 27.—Less than
tjvo feet of reinforced leyees tonight
dammed the rising waters of the Scio
ta river and prevented a flood, which
earlier in the day had threatened to
equal that of 1013, when 99 residents
of the west side of Columbus were
drowned and hundreds of- homes
swept away. Thousands of persons
moved to high ground today. Chances
tonieht favored a passing of the

Historical Case.
This case is historical and an out­
come of the closing of the bank was
a book by Mr. Youmans, called "Leg­
alized Bank Robbery." The case will
probably be long drawn out at the
least, and it is anticipated that it will
be bitterly fought at every point.
Detroit Suffers
From Flood
Detroit, Mich., March 27.—Saginaw,
Genessee and Bay counties, pelted fcy
rain for nearly 48 hours, are flood
centers to storm swept Michigan to­
night. Xearly every stream in these
counties is either out or its banks
or at flood stage. No estimate of the
total damage to property, stock and
merchandise can be made at present.
The loss, however, may be more than
$1,000,000.
The only casualties reported were
in connection with the wreck of the
Wolverine Flyer, on th«j Michigan
railroad near Kalamazoo. A softened
roadbed is believed to be the cause
of the wreck. The train jumped the
track. FouV or five were injured.
Much suffering was reported in De­
troit. Considerable portions of the
low lying districts in the north and
west ends of the city were under wa­
ter.

Time Not Ripe for Another Big
Infantry Drive in the
Woevre.
London, March 27.—The British and
Germans have been fighting fiercely
in the region of St. Loi, just south of
Ypres, and the British, through the
"explosion of a big mine and by inian
try charges, have captured or destroy­
ed a considerable portion of the Ger
man trenches. The British infantry
stormed nad took first and second line
trenches along uOO yards, London offi­

ihat German trenches in tnis region
were blown up to an extent of 100
yards, and "that casualties were caus

positions."
Become Intense.
Again the bombardments have be
come, intense northwest and to the
west of Verdun, and the bombardment
by big guns has been shown in the
Woevre region, southeast of the fort­
ress. The time seemingly is not ripe,
however, for infantry attack and the
men of both sides have been idle in
their trenches for the moment of their

United States Cavalrymen Are
Riding Hard on Bandit's
Trail.
CARRANZA FORCES
ARE HALF HEARTED
Reports Reach Funston of Their
Inefficient Co-Operation With
Americans.
San Antonio, Tex., March 27.—Fran­
cisco Villa's escape from the region
aoout Xamiquipo was preceded by a
smart defeat administered by him to
a part of the Mexican government
troops and was unopposed by other
detachments of the government forc­
es, according to the unofficial but
creditable reports reaching here to­
day. The cordon of Mexican troops
that the Mexican authorities an­
nounce should have been drawn
across his path, gave way, according
to these reports, with a willingness
that indicated their co-operation with
him rather than with the American
forces.
Are Half-Hearted.
Army men at department headquar­
ters were inclined to believe reports
of inefficiency and. half-hearted co­
operation, and today contemplated
with speculative eye the probable I'u
ture of the si»Cuwl phase of operation
just inaugnaiteil by the commander
of I be punil ive expedit ion.
The positions of troops were not
revealed, but it was known that the
cavalrymen -were ye! riding hard
along the trail left, by Villa anil his
little army. Officers of the quarter
masters department studied the best
methods-of gelling provisions, espe­
cially supplies for 1 ho noises and
mules, to the tield army, while (Jen
eral l''unston and his staff anxiously
studied the map, referring frequently
to the scale of miles Ihat showed llio
advance cavalry columns rapidly near
ing points iu miles away from the
bolder.
Villa May Effect Juncture.
That Villa will lie able to effect a
juncture wiili a considerable force be­
fore lie is brought to a stand again is
regarded at headquarters here as
probable. Canuto Iteyes, one of his
generals who has been operating in
the vicinity of Torreon, is known to
have an exceedingly mobile force that,
is by no means negligible, and in the
state of Durango, it is said, i.lie Arrie
ta brolhers are in a position to move
northward lo his support.
Unofficial observers have offered a
theory regarded somewhat favorably
by some American military men,
however, tnat Villa after joining these
and others will continue his move­
ment to the south, gaining strength as
he goes, and other Zapata and other
enemies of the government attempt
to gain possession of Mexico City.
Although this theory is little cred­
ited at headquarters, it. is realized
that he can go about as far as he
likes now without seeing an American
soldier for many weeks.
General Funston will continue his
headquarters here, although it is
probable that he will go to El Paso
and perhaps to Columbus in a few
days for a brief stay.
Raid Ranch.
The ranch of Captain Kelly, former
mayor of El Paso, 32 miles east of EI
Paso, was raided tonight by Mexican
bandits who drove off a number of
cattle and badly beat Mr. Kelly.
Mr. Kelly was notified by a long
distance telephone message from his
foreman. The foreman said the raid­
ers were supposed to have come from
Guadelope, across the river from Fab
ens. The Mexican employees on the
ranch held them off in a battle in
which more than 100 shots were ex­
changed.
RETURN TO MINES.
Douglas, March ?7.—Scores of fore­
men and American employes of Mon­
tezuma Copper company retured
south of the border to resume work at
the mines of the company near N'ao
zaro.
LOCATES SHIP.
Washington. March 27.—The coast
guard, Seneca, reported by wireless
today that she had located the Nor­
wegian ship, Svaland, dismantled and
adrift in a raging storm 23" miles
southeast of Halifax, and would take
her in tow as soon as the gale abated.

Of Sierras
Casas (Jrandes, Chihuahua, (by
wireless to Columbus, NV M.), March
27.—'Villa is flying southwest toward
the foothills of the Sierras, according
to army reports received here today.
The rapidity of his light is precipitat­
ing the American pursuit. All arms
of the service are being used in an
attempt to force the bandit into a
corner.
The Mexican residents of this sec­
tion, which has been ravaged time
and time again by Villa bandits, are
freely giving information regarding
his supplies, arms and strength, to
the American military authorities.
While much of this information has
been too indefinite to be of value, it
is presumed that the knowledge of
the fact Americans are kept informed
as to his movements has influenced
the bandit chieftan to the greatest
haste in his retreat.
Although the United States troops
are following closely in his wake, so
far it is stated no fighting has taken
place.

Delay in Getting Use of Railroads
-V*Tr
Army.
TRUCK SERVICE
NOT SATISFACTORY
E'l Paso, March 27.—With the con­
viction Ilia I the chase of l'"rancisco
Villa is going to prove a long and
tedious one, attention here was turn­
ed once more tonight, on 1ho railroad
situation. Dispatches from Washing­
ton and San Antonio showing that
the United States military authorities
were becoming increasingly impa­
tient for the completion of arrange­
ments with t'arrair/.a for the use of
the railroads, convinced the. officials
that the railroad problem was the
crux of the situation.
Army officers here privately admit
thai, the question of getting adequate
supplies lo the force at the front is
growing serious. They say Ihat the
system of motor transportation across
tiie Chihuahua desert has proven in­
adequate and that as General Per­
shing's columns push farther inlo the
desolation of western Chihuahua the
problem of getting supplies is grow­
ing acute.
Over 250 Miles.
The advance corps of the force is
now well over 2.j( miles from the
frontier and every day presumably
adds many miles to the thin line of
communication. The sand storms
which sweep across the desert are
similar to the simoons which have
again and again wiped out caravans
in the Sahara desert. Former colon­
ists and ranchmen agree that nothing
but a railroad can cope with nature
in this dreary region. Even if wagon
roads are constructeu their life would
be brief. There has been some specu­
lation here over the manner in which
the goods would be shipped. There
has been some word that in the event
of a battle, the supplies would be tak­
en to a point on the Northwestern
railroad, six or seven miles across the
boundary, and there loaded. General
Bell says that if the railroads are
used, al! supplies will be loaded in El
Paso, sent over the river to Juarez
and then dispatched south.
If permission is given to use the
Mexican Northwestern hy the de
facto government", General Funston
will provide his own equipment. The
present rolling stock of the railroad
is said to be inadequate, and very
little of it is available. United States
army headquarters in El Paso already
have arranged with railroads entering
here to provide engineers and cars to
make up supnlv trains. Scores of
trainmen, including engineers, con­
ductors and brakemen, who have al­
ready seen service in Mexico, are
ready to make up the crews.

Washington, March 27.—Failure of
senate republicans to take an action
at a conference today on the Mex­
ican situation left the administration
unhampered in dealing with the prob­
lem.
The conference was called with the
purpose of considering steps to force
the dispatch of additional troops to
the border for patrol duty. In the
face of official advices denying alarm­
ing reports, however, and of Cteneral
Funs ton's apparent confidence that
he has enough men for any present
emergency, the republicans adjourned
with some of their leaders agreeing
that there was nothing to do but sup­
port the plans of the administration,
a this ime.
Official advices confirmed press dis
paches telling of the physical condl-l
4it»p eudU«l(l.An, keepin& a, 2ft0rinlle
line supplied without a fAflfdad.
While there is no shortage offo6A
or other supplies for the troops at:
the front, cavalry mounts already ar«
on short rations.
Take Steps.
Steps to meet, the situation havw
been taken by Secretary Baker, as
there is no indication of an early
agreement on Ihe proposed protocol
providing for use of Mexican lines by
American troops. Secretary Baker is­
sued this statement late today:
"All information the department
has from the border shows conditions
lo be quiet and the excitement ot
the last few days somewhat allayed.
We have no dispatches indicating act­
ual couflicts between the American
soldiers and any forces of any flind
in iMexico.
Purchase Equipment.
"The expedition is, of course, mov«
ing forward and so lengthening the
line of communication. For that rea­
son General Funston has requested
and the government has purchased
two additional auto truck equipments,
comprising 54 cars in all. In addi­
tion to that, General Funston tells
us that, additional aeroplanes will be
of service, both in reconnoisance
work and in carrying messages from
the advance columns to the base at
Columbus. Of the aeroplanes already
there, two have been destroyed. Oth­
ers have need of replacing parts, but
two of them are in actual continuous
service. The department is now ne­
gotiating for the purchase of addi­
tional aeroplanes, but neither the
number nor type has yet been dete»
mined.
"Wireless communication is report­
ed to be intermittent, because of
the static conditions in the field
there. For this reason additional im­
portance is given to the request for
larger aeroplane ficilitles.
Cannot Accept Offer.
The secretary said the destruction
of two army aeroplanes bad not been
explained to the department. Four of
the remaining six machines on the
border were uilder repair, leavUf on­
ly two of the drigina£6itht in actual
service. The army has plenty of skill*
ed aviators to operate machines that
will be purchased, Mr. Baker added.
He said that while, the Aero Clob of!
America had volunteefed the services
of its men and machines, the law fdr»
bade their acceptance.
General Carranza desires to. delay
replying to the request for the use
of certain Mexican railroads nntilrtho
protocol has been agreed to, bntttko
state department will press for
prompt disposition of the request as
a separate issue. It is realized that
a week or more may pass before the.
terms of the protocol can be put in
final shape, and the necessity for ttav*
ing the railroads opened to use by
General PerBhing is immediate.
Diplomacy Too Slew.
The army in Mexicb cannot wait fop
the slow processes of dipUttacy. Par
this reason, General Fiinstoo Will bo
supplied promptly iritk ehouth Motor
transportation to establish an* Bate*
tain a fully equipped supply systets.
Additional tracks will be ordered as
rapidly as use can be made of thea.
