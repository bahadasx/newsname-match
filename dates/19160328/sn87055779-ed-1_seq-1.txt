to Speed Up Legislation
on Railroads.
Iliteriiatioti.il News Service:
WASHINGTON. March 2Ü. rres't
Wilson today urged House leader
Kitchin to speed up consideration of
two matters of legislation on which
be said the whole movement of our
trade and industry seemed to wait
the shipping bill, and the resolution
for an investigation into transporta

In a letter to Mr. Kitchin the
president said:
'"My dear Mr. Kitchin: In con

other directions, causing Iist. Atty.
Swann delay in presenting the evi
dence to the grand jury for several
days. A story that Waite was
blackmailed and the supposition
that another man Jn this city may
have acted in collusion in the mil
lionaire's death opened two new
lines for investigation.
Waite is expected to make a per
sonal confession to Swann today
supplementing his admission that bo
gave arsenic to his mther-in-law.
Kvidence is now in tne hands of
the district attorney tending to in
volve a man who h.s been identified
with the affairs of Tr. Waite. Just
what this evidence is has not been
disclosed, as premature publication
will seriously interfere with tho ad

It is now alleged that Waite was
blackmailed for approximately $10,
000 on his return from the funeral
of Mr. Peck at Grand Itapids.
Tiecause of these new angles an
indictment h:is been held up, al
though the grand jury, it is said, lias
enough evidence now to fil a true

the prosecution is eoiineciod with

PASO, Texa.s. March 2:. Oen.
Carranra has refused to grant the
request f the Fnited States govern
merit that American troops sent into
Mexico In pursuit of Francisco Villa
bo permitted to us the Mexican
Northwestern Railway for the trans
portation of supplies.
The first chief has also notified
Gen Gaviera. military commander
at Juarez, that he must not permit
tho passage over tills line of any
shipment of food. ammunition or
equipment for the American troops.
Carranz-a has farther barred th
Fnited iStnfes authorities and Gen.
Pershing from using Mexican tele
graph lines to and from Juarez.
This development shows that the
American troops must depend upon
their own lines of communication
for food and ammunition. As they
proceed farther into Mexico in pur
suit of Villa it is becoming- increas
ingly difficult for them to get thes
supplies.
When Carranza's action hecarno
known today it cau.s'-d a wave of
pessimism to sweep ;Jong the bor
der. This was f urther intensified by
an attack made last night by Mexi
can outlaws upon the ranch of C.
R. Kelly, ex-mayor of Rl Paso, near
Fabens. a border town east of F.I
Pa so.
Raid llonlcr Ranch.
The bandits crossed the bolder
under cover of darknoss-, raided the
ranch and beat tho mperintendorit.
This man. though badly injured,
made Iiis way to the T. M. Win go
ranch and informed a detachment of
troop K. eighth cavalry of the out

a "Hying squadron" 'of 10 a alrymeu
in pursuit of the bandits.
The Mexican raiders had dlsap
appeared by the time the troopers
r ached the K'oily raKeb. at mid
night. It wac beliee,l they had re
crossed the Rio Grande, but t' be
doubly sr.te if this fact two other
caalry detachments were hastened
to the vicinity to scour th- border.
The bandits who cro.-ed the bor

While the hunt for the Fabens
