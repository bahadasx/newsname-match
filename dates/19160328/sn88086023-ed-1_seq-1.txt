BERLIN. March II. The Rus
aiarja today renewed their attacks on
a hundred mile front. Their losses
were reported the heaviest since the
retreat from the Dunajec. The spring
thaw Is epected soon, flooding the
lowlands and It Is believed this will
compel the withdrawal of a portion
of the Russian lines. The Germans
also will suffer from floods but will
not be compelled to withdraw from
many places, It is believed this is
the reason the Russians are attempt
ing to selie the highlands before the
spring freshet come.
German officers assert that the
Russian marksmanship is poor. They
claim the German losses are light.
Formerly one Russian officer was
found among every 100 privates cap
tured. Now the ratio Is one officer
to ever)' 10 privates.
