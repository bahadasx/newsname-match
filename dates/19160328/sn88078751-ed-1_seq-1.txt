Villa And His Men
V
inp Their
Is Being Pursued
0! American Cavalry
San Antonio, Tex., March 27. The
fullest leport General Pimston has
received from General Pershing has
reached the southern deportment
headquarters. Pershing announces
that Villa broko through tho cordon
of Mexican troops which had him
partly hemmed In. Three columns of
Amorlcau cavalry under Colonel Dodd
are chasing him.
The baudlt, with his men, are head
ing into the Madera valley, which
runs south from the Namiquipa coun
try toward Guerrero. The Americans
are- 250 miles below the border and
us far south 03 Chihuahua City.
It was established the Carranzistas
are not co-operating with the Ameri
cans. General Funs'ton declined to
give out the full text of Pershing's
message on this point.
General Pershing's complete state
ment of the location of troops says
that three columns of cavalry are fol
lowing the advance columns as sup
ports, to bo called out if needed. Two
companies of infantry are at El Valle
to protect Pershing's advance base.
The principal base Is now at Casas
Grnndes. This means the two com
panies of foot soldiers have marched
$00 miles to the south. Pershing's
message said nothing of UBing a rail
road and stated specifically there had
been no fighting between the outlaws
find Americans.
General Pershing, Just before wir
ing, had completed a trip through the
country where the foremost troops
were. He was not on an "inspection"
trip, as home dispatches stated, but
went tho long way round 'for tactical
purposes. He was "lining up" the
country so as to bo able better to di
rect the various columns for hl3 sub
headquarters at El Valle. Tho gen
eral in the field declared in his mes
sage that the troops have settled
down to the single task of "finding
where Villa is." That Villa Is sustain
ing his famous reputation as "tho fox
of the Sierras" is read between the
lines of Pershing's reports.
Details of the operations about
Namiquipa that concluded with the es
cape of Villa were not revealed, but
there Is little reason to believe that he
was badly whipped or even weakened
by the lighting directed against him
by the do facto government troops.
Reports last week from Mexican
sources indicated that ho had been se
Tcrely defeated by tho Carranza
forces and a few reports stated that
American troops had participated lu
the action. It now appears that no
Americans were actually engaged and
the fact that Villa made his way
through what was described as an en
circling line of Mexican troops was
taken to Indicate that he was the
victor.
Unless fresh Mexican forces are

London, March 27. The following
statement was issued by the British
war office :
"An attack by British seaplanes
was delivered upon German airship
sheds In Schle3wIg-Holsteln, eastward
of the Island of Sylt. The seaplanes
were conveyed to their rendezvous
close to the German coast by an es
corting force of light cruisers and
destroyers under Commodore Tyr
whltt. "Three of the seaplanes which took
part In the attack are missing. The
British destroyer Medusa was in col
lision with the destroyer Laverock
and it is feared that in the stormy
weather which prerailed the Medusa
may have been lost Two German
enned patrol vessels were sunk by
our destroyers. No detailed report
has yet been received, but from Dan
ish press messages It would appear
that this operation, which was car
ried out within the enemy's waters,
achieved its object."

of the Oleaster.
Paris, March 21. An official state
ment Issued here declares there Is no'
doubt that the channel steamer "Sus
sex was torpedoed without warning.
The statement is based on affidavits
made by American survivors.
John Hearley, Albany, N. Y., a press
association correspondent, deposes,
the statement says, that on Friday
about 3 o'clock In the afternoon, while
a dozen Americans were watching
from the bridge, a great explosion oc
curred in the forepart of the vessel
without warning and that three Amer
icans at least saw the passage of tue
torpedo. Professor Baldwin, wife and
daughter, have disappeared. Hearley
thinks they are dead. Tingle W. Cul
bertson declares that he saw Miss
Baldwin stretched on the deck wounded-In
the head.
Samuel S. Bemls of Harvard uni
versity deposes that the explosion oc
curred without the slightest warning"
to show there was the least danger
and that many persons were thrown
into the sea, that some were killed,
and some wounded, that he sawr
bodies on the bridge of the Sussex
and that while being rescued he saw-
two persons drowned.
The total number of victims is still
unknown. It is estimated variously at
50 to 80. Of the Americans, it now Is
regarded as certain that Miss Eliza
beth Baldwin was killed. It 13 be
lieved her father. Professor J. Mark
Baldwin, was lost, and that -posslbly.-Mrs.
Baldwin perished.
