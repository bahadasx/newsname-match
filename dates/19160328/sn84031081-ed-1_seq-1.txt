El Paso, Tex., March 27. With the
conviction that the oha.e of l'ancho
villa was L'oinir to prove a long and
tedious onp, attention here was turned!
once more tonight on the railroad!
situation. Dispatches from Wash-1
ington and San Antonio showing thati
the United States military authorities
were becoming increasingly impatient!
for the completion of arrangements j
with General t arranza tor tne use or
the Mexican roads confirmed the be
lief held hero for the last week that
the railroad problem was the present
rrnv th.. uitllntioll.
Army officers here privately admit
that the question of getting adequate
supplies to the forces at the front is
growing serious. They say that thej
present system of motor transporta-,
lion across Chihuahua desert has
proved entirely Inadequate, and as
General Pershing's columns push fur
ther into the desolation of western
Chihuahua the supplies problem is
urowino- ncnte. The advance corps of
the expeditionary force is now well;
over 2.r,0 miles from the frontier ami;
every day presumably adds manyj
days to the thin line of communica-j
lions. I
The sandstorms which sweep across I
the Chihuahua wastes are similar to I
the simoons which have again and
again wiped out caravans in the .Sa
hara desert. Mormon colonists and:
American ranchmen agree that noth
ing but a railroad can cope with nn-j
ture in this dread region. Even if,
wagon roads were constructed their1
life would he brief. 1
Will Ship From El lnso. j
There has been some speculation,
here as to the manner in which goods:
would be shipped from El I'aso. It
has been suggested that to avoid con
tact with the Curranza troops in
Juarez, supplies would be taken in mo-;
tor trucks to a point on the Mexico!
Northwestern six or seven miles south j
of the boundary and there loaded.
General Hell ridicules this idea. He
says that If the railroads are used, all,
supplies will be loaded in El Paso, j
sent over the river to Juarez and!
thence dispatched south.
da of tuns of foodstuffs
clothing, ammunition, hospital sup-
Dlies and forage are in warehouses j

Carranza has granted the right to

A few hours after such information j
comes if it does come several heav- j

Northwestern railroad Is granted byj
1he do facto government. General j
Funston will provide his own equip-!

The present rolling stock of the rail
road is said to be inadequate, so very
little of it is available here.
I'nited States army headquarters in
P!i T'non a trend v has arranged with
railroads entering here to provide en-,

trains. Scores of trainmen, including!
engineers, conductors and brakemen,!
who already have seen service in
Mexico are ready to make up the
crews. All that is needed is the com
mand to move.
People Are Hopofiil.
While public opinion on the bor
der is openly pessimistic regarding
any speedy- termination to the pursuit
of Villa, there is one ray of hope that
persists. It is pointed out that the
bandit has never had to match his
generalship against a force of Amer
ican soldiers equipped with every ap
pliance and device that modern
science has contributed to the art of
wurfare. The optimists are especial
ly insistent on the possibilities of
aeroplanes with General Pershing's
columns. The scouts of the air have
had little opportunity up to the pres
ent to demonstrate their worth on
account of weather conditions. At
this time of the year the Sierras of
northern Mexico are swept continual-

gales which drive over the moun
tains are broken into a myriad pow
erful currents against which an avia

This condition will soon be chang

melting from the peaks of the Sierras
and the spring gales will be a thing
of the past in a few weeks. Then
clear, calm weather may be expected
and the only problem for the flying
men will be suitable landing places.
These may be found in the numerous

One of the minor hardships which
the American soldiers at the front
are at present enduring is the diffi
culty of communicating with their
wives and relatives back home. Such
mail as is coming back is censored
to such an extent that it consists
largely of the "1 am well and hope
you are the same" variety. Like the

On the long communication line.lt
is said that nothing worse has been
encountered than a little marauding
by professional bandits who have not
fired a shot at any troops. One of
the aeroplanes, which flew too far
upon Us entrv Into Mexico and which
had to be left in the hills for nearly
two days, was visited hy Mexicans
supposed to be bandits, who robbed
the machine of numerous appliances,
but who did not offer to destroy or
seriouslv damage the plane itself,
some of the scientific instruments
which they took could hardly be of
value in a' bandits' trade but seem to
have heen taken out of curiosity. On
two or three occasions wires of the.
constitutionalist telegraph lines have
heen cut, so that on the face of things,
the marauding has been direrted
about equally against constitutionalist
and American property.

Washington, .March 27. Failure of
senate republicans to take any action
at a conference today on the Mexican
situation left the administration un
hampered in dealing with the prob
lem. Th.' conference was called to con
sider steps to force (he dispatch of ad
ditional troops to the border for pa
trol duty. In th,. face of official ad
vices denying alarming reports, how
ever, anil of General Funslon's ap
parent confidence that he has enough
men for any present emergency, the
republicans adjourned with some of
Iheir leaders agreeing that there was
nothing to do but support the admin
istration's plans at this time.
official advices confirmed press
dispatches telling of the physical dif
ficulties elicountred by General Fun
ston in keeping a 2iio miles supply
line In operation wit bout the use of
railroads. While there is no short
age of food or other supplies for th
troops at the front, cavalry mounts
already are short on rations.
Steps to meet the situation have
been taken by Secretary Maker, as
there is no Indication of an early
agreement on Ihe proposed protocol
providing for the use of Mexican lines
by American Hoops. Mr. Maker Is
sued this statement, late today:
Slatciiieni hy Maker.
"All Information the department
has from the border shows conditions
tu be quiet and the excitement of the
last few days somewhat allayed. We
have no dispatches liiilb-atlng actual
conflict between American soldiers
and foreign forces of any kind In
.Mexico.
'Th,. expedition is. of course, mov
ing forward and o leiilbenlng tho
line of communication. For that rea
son General Funston has requested,
and the department has purchased
two automobile Iruck equipments
comprising fifty cars in all. In ad
dition to that General Funslon tells
Us that additional aeroplanes will be
of service, both In rcconnolsani'e work
and in carrying messages from the
advance column to Ihe base, at Colum
bus. Of the aeroplanes already there
two have been destroyed, others have
need of replacing parts, but two of
them are in actual continuous serv
ice. The department is now negotiat
ing for the purchase of additional
aeroplanes, but. neither the number
nor type has been yet determined.
"Wireless communication is report
ed to be intermittent, because of the
static condilion ln the electric field
there. For this reason additional im
portance is given to the request, for
large aeroplane facilities.""
The secretary said the desl ruction
of two army aeroplanes hail not been
explained as yet lo the department.
Four of tile remaining six machines
on the border were under repair,
leaving only two of the original eight
In actual service. The army has
plenty of skilled aviators to operate
the machines that will be purchased,
Mr. Maker added. He said that while
Ihe Aero club has volunteered the
services of its men and machines the
law forbade their acceptance.
Protocol ltcliiycd.
The negotiation of a protocol cov
ering use of the Mexican railways and
other matters beyond the border, en
countered a delay today with Ihe re
ceipt of General ( 'arranza 's sugges
tion as to modifications and additions
to Ihe plan worked out by Counsellor
I'olk of the stale department and
Eliseo Arredoiido, ambasador desig
nate. Mr. Ari-cdondo handed the com
munication to Secretary Ijinsliig, who
refused to comment. -There are Indi
cations, however, that tin; suggestions
will require considerable study and
possibly further Interchanges with
General ('arranza.
General Cu rrari7.ii desires to delay
replying to the request, for the use of
certain Mexican railroads until Ihe
protocol bus been agreed to, but the
slate department will press for
prompt disposition of the request us
a separate Issue, it is realized that a
week or more may pass before the
terms of the protocol can be put in
final shape, and ihe necessity for hav
ing the railroads open to use by Gen
eral I'crshing Is immediate.
The urmy in Mexico cannot wait
for the slow processes of diplomacy.
For Ibis reason General Funston will
be supplied promptly with enough
motor transportation to establish and
maintain a fully equipped supply ss
tnm. Additional trucks will be order
ed as rapidly as use can be made of
them. Advance supply depots will be
placed at intervals along the com
munications lines, each being fed by
the depot at its rear. As fast as food,
horse fuller or ammunition is drawn
for use at the most advanced depot
it will be sent from the border line to
maintain a constant level.
Excitement Has Subsided.
Moth the state and navy depart
in' ntx received additional reports on
the situation in Mexico, officers and
consuls reported quiet in all parts of
the southern republic. The excite

and tile American expedition after
