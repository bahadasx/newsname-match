Important changes In the location
of the paymaster's office and the ad
ministration building at the naval
station are in progress today. The
former structure is being moved from
the Ewa end of the naval reservation
to the Waikiki end, near the radip
station, and the administration build
ing will be moved to a site adjacent
to the relocated office.
The object of these changes is to
allow the Hawaiian department use of
more than two-thirds of the reserva
tion for the erection of a warehouse
or storehouse. It is understood thai
the arrangement between the navy
and war departments, relative to the
army using the major part of the res
ervation, makes possfble the cutting
thrrugh of Punchbowl street to Allen
street, where it now (ends at the
mauka side of the reservation. That
area Ewa of the extended street will
be army property; Waikiki, navy.
At present the army is allowed to
use, the old naval sheds at the naval
station, for storing hay, grain and
supplies, in addition to making 'use
of the old immigration station Ewa
of the naval station.
As soon as the necessary money Is
available, the army' wfll do consider
able construction work alon? the strip
which has been taken over bv the
transfer. ThU work will include the
rei air of storehouses now there, the
building of new storehouses, and re
pair to the doc. The present terri
torial immigrat'on site, which was
transferred by the governor and har
bor board , some time ago, is included
in the (property.
The storehouses will be used only
for general freight shipments brought
in here. Ammunition will not le
