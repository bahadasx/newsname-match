RIGHT SHOPPING AND RIGHT DRESSING
THE way lo stylish and economical
dressing does not lie in long and
tiresome tours of all the shops in town.
Hy scattering their energies in this
manner women genially end by buying
on impulse and then tiring of the gar
ment early in its life. And this hap
hazard method is costly in the long
run, as all business is costly when it is
carried on with a great number of
unknown persons or firms.
The proper and efficient way to shop
is to select one thoroughly reliable
store, try it out; and, having found it
honest and capable and styleworthy,
bring your patronage there lor as long
as the firm and its salefolks continue
to show good judgment, good stock
and honesty of purpose.
Prices, too, are -'right" here.
Coals from $5.00 to $25.00.
Suits from $15.00 to $35.00.
