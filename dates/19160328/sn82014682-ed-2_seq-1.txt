SUGAR SITUATIONS
VIEWED WITH GOOD DEAL
OF SATISFACTION HERE
The action of the senate caucus and
finance cotnm ttee in limiting the sus
pension. 'of the; free sugar clause to
May I.U920, has net depressed Ha
waii's sugar men. On the contrary,
the situation is regarded' by some of
the best informed of them with much
satisfaction. While decision on the
period to May 1, 1929, is not outright
repeal of "free sugar," it gives four
years' leeway, 'and most of the local
sugar men think that there will br
at least cne Republican Congress be
fore that time, with the probability
that the protecticn will be made per
manent. The Kitchin bill is expected to b
passed by the senato in a.bout tho ,
shape it comes from the finance com
mittee, after which; it ' gqcs to th?
house. If the bouse refuses to con
cur in the amendment, the situation
-might-.be overclouded, but it Ms
thought here that the house will prob
ably yield. ;. .
The fo; lowing correspondence from
Washington was written, of course, be
fore the bill reached, the senate,
but it is interesting as showing th
