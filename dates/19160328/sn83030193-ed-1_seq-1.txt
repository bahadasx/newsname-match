LINER SUSSEX TORPEDOED,
MOST OF WILSON CABINET SAY,
BUT FULL PROOF IS LACKING
After Full Discussion It Is Decided
to Make Inquiry at Berlin, and
Message to Gerard Has Prob
ably Been Delivered.
WASHINGTON. .March 28. -Tim lulled States Ijhs Inquired of Her
man?, through Ambassador Gerard, whether any of Its submarines tor
pedoed tho Ilrlllsli channel steamer Sin-sex.
Secretary Winning announced uflor I'm Cabinet mr-nt to-day at
which tho entire Mihjeet wan discussed that it had been decided In make
euch nn. inquiry. Latrr it' nai, learned that the Inquiry had licon mailt',
and. In fact, probably Is already In llerlin. The prcsout status of the coui
mtiulcatlon that of r.a 'nnulry. It has not advanced to tho stage or a
protest or a demand.
In makinrj thli inquiry the "
State Departmtnt notified the
Berlin Foreinn Offico by cahlo
tht evidenco now in tho deport
ment's potsetiton pointed to sub
marine attacks.
Members of t tt (' ilmict sulci that
vldenco In possesion of 'ho I tided
Stated was not . un-lni v enough i"
warrant decisive actum at iIiIh time
For this reason It was d rided t"
make Inquiry of Germany. A majority
of the Cabinet members hellewd pre
Umlnary reporb clearly Indicated t lie
Buuex was torpedoed. Ono menibor
believes tho liner was sunk by a initio.
Too President and Cabinet members
were furnished with all reports con
cerning the disaster which Ifad
reached tho Stnto Department from
diplomatic and Consular representa
tives in Franco nnd in KngUind.
Cablnot members declared a break
with Germany -was not nn immediate
prospect. It was said that It Gcr
many admitted torpedoing the Suniox
a situation would bo brought about
.Which would bo most serious.
Should Germany dony that ono of
bar submarines attacked the Sussex,
the American Government would
reach, Its conclusion from the evi
dence now being collected by its
diplomatic representatives abroad.
Should Germany admit tho attack,
but claim the submurlno commander
exceeded his orders, officials believed
that would be regarded as evldonce
that It was impracticable for sub
marine commanders to attempt to
distinguish between armed and un
armed vossels.
It had been intimated earlier in tho
day that no communication would bo
addressed to Germany, Jt was de
clared that Congress would back up
the President In any action ho do
clded to tuko. Thero soemed to bo a
feeling that tho nttltudo of Congress
would mako unnecessary a message
on the new U-boat crisis.
SYom being rather a. drag on tho
Administration's foreign policy as
In tho case of the armed mer
chantmen docroe Congress appeared
to have becomo a spur to urgo
the President on. Among
Senators,
who aro more atfoctcd by public opin
ion perhaps than State Department
otllofals, thero was llttlo doubt
that tho publlo Is convinced the two
boats wero torpedoed, and that even
a disavowal of the act and promises
for tho futuro would be taken doubt
fully. If tho President determines to break
off relations with Hi rlln, it Is be
lieved, ho will send emigres a note
announcing his Intention end e
plalulng tho incidents which deter
mined hiseourso of action, lie will
not seek authority to act from Con
