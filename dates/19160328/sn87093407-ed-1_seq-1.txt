I GERMANY IS
I CONSIDERED
WASHINGTON, March 28.—The state
department today cabled to Berlin an in
quiry asking whether a German submarine
torpedoed the Sussex and Englishman.
It is apparent that the state department
and the White House are disposed to de-
Imand something more than a mere disavow
al, if it is shown that a German submarine
was responsible.
It is not believed a severance of relations
will be too drastic. The cabinet decided to
interrogate Germany after Secretary Lan
sing had presented his official reports of the
disaster.

REPORTER-CONVICT WRITES Of WALLA WALLA W
THEY took his fingei* prints and his Bertillon measurements. They gave him the regulation prison hath, the medical examination, and the
whole routine of prison life for three days. Then the warden at Walla Walla penitentiary discovered that he wasn't the high-class forger he
pretended to be. He was a reporter of The Tacoma Times who was looking for "local color" to write of prison life.
The reporter, E. A. Peters, was admitted into the penitentiary last Friday. He had no commitment papers. He told the officials that his
name was Peter Wilson, that he had pleaded guilty to forgery in Tacoma, and that he had been allowed to go to the penitentiary without any
guards. He was questioned at length by Warden Drum, who said he never admitted a man to prison before without the commitment papers.
Peters assured him the papers would come before long.
When they didn't show up by Sunday night, Drum called the young man into his office, and again cross-examined him. Peters had occupied
a prison cell for three days, and he concluded he was ready to reveal his true identity.
Today he is back at his old job. Being an observing young man, Peters has gathered a lot of interesting things to write about. His articles on
prison life at Walla Walla will appear in only one Seattle paper The Star. The first will be published Wednesday.

Francisco Villa and "harassing
him constantly" were the Im
portant developments in th«
Mexican man-hunt today.
Can. Cavira. at Juarez, made
public the following dispatch
from Gen. Brrtani, constitution
alist commander at Madera:
"Villa is at El Oso. I believe
Col. Cano is the one of our
chief* closest to him. Our
troops and the Americans arc
harassing him constantly."
Ten cavalrymen are In pursuit
today of Mexican outlaws who
swooped across tbe border near
Pabens and attacked the ranch of
C. K. Kelly, former mayor of El
Paso. The ranch superintendent
was assaulted and severely beaten.
Ha walked to the T. E. Wlngo
ranch, near by, and notified a de
tachment of the Eighth cavalry,
troop E. which was encamped there.
Ten fast riders were ordered
after the outlaws.
I.atest dispatches from the Amer
ican expedition say Villa Is fleeing
rapidly southward toward tb»
Sierra Madre foothills, with Amer
icans closely trailing him.
Mexicans who formerly hailed
Villa as an Idol are now aiding hla
pursuers.
An aviator from the base ll®
miles south of Dublan headquarter*

The problem of getting supplies
to the advanced posts Is becoming
