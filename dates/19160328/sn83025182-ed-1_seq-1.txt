WASHINGTON, March 28.—Wheth
er the United States, on proof that
the Sussex and Englishman were vic
tims of German torpedoes, will first
allow diplomacy to take Its coarse, or
whether relations shall be broken off
Immediately,/today was discussed by
President Wilson with his cabinet and
with Senator Stone, bis chief congres
sional adviser on forelgln affairs.
Both cabinet members and Senator
Stone were ezpeoted to tell the presi
dent he would be backed by congress
and the 'public If he should take the
more drastic course.
Meanwhile tha state department
was gathering every bit of possible,
evidence In line with the determina
tion of President Wilson not even to
make an Inquiry of the German gov
ernment until all phases of the ques
tion had been conclusively examined
by this government
It seemed likely that the attitude
of congress will make unnecessary a
message from the president If he
should determine to break off German
relations. From being rather a drag
on the administration's foreign policy
—as in the case of the armed mer
chantmen decree—congress appeared
to have become a spur to urge the
president on. Among senators who
are more affected by public opinion
perhaps than state department offi
cials, there was little doubt but that
the public is convinced the two boats
were torpedoed and that even a dis
avowal of the act and promises Tor
the future would be taken doubtfully.
Wnen the president determines to
break off relations, it is believed he
will send congress a note announcing
his intention and explaining incidents
which determined his course of ac
tion. He will not seek authority to
act from congress and It is possible
his memorandum will come after, ln
stead of before, the act—as when he
recognized Carranza. He will express
the hope that congress approves his
action.
While It Is generally believed here
that Germany will disavow both at
tacks, if proof is made that her sub
marines were responsible, the nature
of the kaiser's 'disavowal must differ
from other German utterances if dip
lomatic relations are to continue. In
view of other German statements and
promises, it is believed the submarine
commander responsible must be defi
nitely named to the world and the
fact of his adequate punishment es
tablished to the satisfaction of the
United States.
One course that has been given con
sideration Is that of breaking off re­

NEW YORK, March 28.—Dr. Arthur

confess to District Attorney Swann
that he murderously poisoned bis mil

The confession will declare untrue

clung for several days. Unless Dr.
Walte goes farther in his confession
than he indicated to his brother, he
will not implicate others.
Word that the confession would be

that Germany would make her pun

her assurances for the future so satis

While the Sussex case appeared to
day to be Che probable basis for the
break with Germany, the reported tor
pedoing of the British ship English

missing, served to aggravate (he teu~

Reports on it were meagre, due. It
was believed, to the foot that foreign
officials are more Interested in the
passenger ship Sussex than in the
horse ship Englishman.
The state department believes there
is no attempt to withhold information
and that all facts will be available
soon.
Cases Involving American passen
gers have always attracted more at
tention than cases concerning Ameri
can sailors. Actually, however, the
loss of an American sailor's life Is re
garded as more serious than the death
of a passenger, inasmuch as a sailor's
occupation requires him to travel on
the sea.
Will Ask Oermany.
[By Robert J. Bender, United Press
Staff Correspondent.]
WASHINGTON, March 28.—Presi
dent Wilson and the cabinet decided
to ask Germany for any knowledge she
may have concerning the wrecking of
the Sussex by an explosion.
Inasmuch as evidence in hand has
practically convinced the state de
partment the Sussex was torpedoed by
a submarine, the inquiry to Berlin Is
expected to go forward soon.
This decision was reached In the
face of much feeling among some
cabinet men. that if the Sussex were
a torpedo victim, there was no neces
sity for asking the nationality of the
submarine, since only German sub
marines have infested the water In
which the disaster occurred.
The administration's attitude to
ward the suggestion that disavowal
will be promptly forthcoming from
Germany if one of her submarines was
guilty, was not changed by the cabinet
session. It is still apparent that the
disposition of the white house and
state department is to demand some
thing more than disavowal and that

The fact she was with. Dr. Watte

BERLIN, Marr —Bent on saw
ing themselves a forced retreat
on a front of
mt
than 100 miles,
the Russians renewing their at
tacks agalnst~~Von Hlndenburg's
armies with great fury.
The Slavs have suffered no greater
losses since the memorable retreat
from the Dunajec began nearly a year
ago. But German officers pointed out
today that It is absolutely necessary
for General Kuropatkln to ocntlnus
the attaoka or else admit defeat.
During Von Hlndenburg's great of

Russian line down the northern and

troops had fallen back to lowland
positions, knowing that nature would
came to his aid In the spring.
Within a few weeks, tne sqrlng
thaw will set in In the northern coun
try. The Russian trenches In the
lowlands will be flooded and It will
be neoessary to withdraw the whole
Slav line.
The Germane will suffer somewhat
from the floods, but will not be forced
to give ground to sny considerable
degree. For this reason ths Russians
are wasting ammunition extravagant,
ly In an effort to seize positions on
higher ground before the eprlng fresh
ets begin.
Despite the fury of ths Russian st.
tack, the utmost confidence prevails
here. A German officer, writing to
relatives from the Vllna seotor on
March 18, said that ths Russian mark
manship was so poor and the German
defenses so well constructed that his

wounded.
Officers report that the Russians
have changed taotlcs, offloers now
charging with their men. In previous
fighting, not more than one officer
was captured to every 300 men. The
ratio now averages one officer to
sixty men.

that artillery exchanges are now
spreading to sectors which have been
quiet for several months as If an In

EL PASO, Texas, March 88./—An
other Moxioan border raid and an offi
cial message locating Villa yesterday
at 01 Oso, were the principal develop
ments of the last twenty^tour hours in
the Mexican situation.
A number of bandits were drt veil
away from the Fabens ranch of O. EX
Kelly, ex-mayor of 531 Paso, by two
small detachments of the Eighth car
airy and four Texas rangers. About
100 shots were exchanged In a run
ning fight of several hours before the
Mexicans esoaped across the border
In the darkness.
The raiders obtained nothing,
General Gavira of Juarez made pub
lic the following message from Gen
eral Francisco Bertanl, donunandor of
the Carranza garrison at Maddrla:
"Villa is at El Oso. Believe that
Colonel Cano Is one of our ohlefs
closest Villa. Both ours and the
American forces harrasslng Villa con
stantly."
The latest official advices from the
American expedition told of Villa In
full flight southwest toward the toot
hills of the Sierras, with American de
tachments in his wake. Mecxlean resi
dents In districts where Villa was
once an idol, gave his pursuers news
of his route and supplfed the food
stuffs at record high prices In Ameri
can money. Army flyers having es
tablished a base 120 miles south of
Dublan, headquarters of Brigadier
General Pershing, were engaged in
scouting with the vanguard of the ex
pedltion nearly 300 miles from the bor
der.
The advanced base presumably is
equipped for a considerable Infantry
and artillery force to support the van
guard.
The problem of transporting sup
plies to the base camps continues
acute with army officials here still In
expectation of Momentary permission
to use the Mexican linos from Juares.
Further word was anxiously awaited
In Ed Paso of the situation at Torreon
whore foreigners wore last reported to
