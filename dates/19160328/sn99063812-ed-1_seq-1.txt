Grace M. E. church, delivered the ser
mon, his theme being "Immortality,"
as based upon 12th Luke, 27-40. He
compared tho humnn, body with a
seed, pointing out that In neither
nothing of the lire olement can be

In the death of WHUam Harrison
Shaw, Klamath Falls loses one of her
best young men, a man who was a
splendid example ot what can be ac
complished by honest determination
and perseverance, In the overcoming
ot apparently Insurmountable obsta
cles. His demise has cast a deep sor
row over all of his friends, for they
feel that this ended what promised to
be a brilliant career, Just as Mr. Shaw
was beginning to reap some of the
benefits of his earlier struggles and
