Indications That it Could Over
come President's Veto
WOULD CHECK IMMIGRATION
This Is the Bill of Which Senator Dil
lingham Is the Author and a
Strong Supporter.
Washington, March 27. Tho lit
eiacy test section of the Burnett Immi
gration bill was sustained, 225 to 82, in
the 1 louse today. This vote on the prin
cipal issue between the advocates and
the opponents of restricted immigra
tion presages the final passage of the
Iiurnett measure by an overwhelmiiij
majority, probably by tomorrow night
The comparatively small vote cast to
day against the literacy test also indi
cates that the House may be able tc
override the veto of the President
should he again disapprove the liter
acy test clause. It is believed by Chair
man Iiurnett that practically every op
ponent of the bill was present today
while many of its advocates, assured
of tho approval of tho literacy test
clause, were absent.
On two occasions opponents of the
Burnett bill have registered less than
100 votes. The vote against the adop
tion of the special rule calling up the
Burnett bill was only 82.
No roll call was taken on the liter
acy test clause today, as the measure
was being considered Informally ir.
Committee of the Whole. It la expect
ed that Hepresentative Sabath, wlu
moved to strike tho clause from tlif
bill today, will renew his effort wher.
the bill is put on final passage.
Although a two-thirds vote Is requir
ed to override a Presidential veto, Mr
Burnett estimates that when practical
ly the entire membership of the Houst
is present. there will he an ample ma
jority for the motion to override. . .
DANGERS OF A COLD
Bennington People Will Do Well te
Heed Them.
Many bad cases of kidney trouble re
suit from a clod or chilli , Congested
kidneys fall behind in filtering the poi
son-laden blood and backache, head
ache, dizziness and disordered kidne;
action follow. Don't neglect a cold
Use Doan's Kidney Pills at the first
sign of kidney trouble. Follow this
Bennington resident's example:
II. C. Taylor, It. F. D. No. 3, Ben
nington, says: "For some time I had
soreness in my back and a dull pair
across my kidneys, which was particu
larly severe when I stooped or exerted
myself. I did not rest well and when
ever I caught cold, it settled in my
kidneys, making the trouble more se
vere. Doan's Kidney Pills acted dl
rectly on my kidneys and soon re
moved the lameness in my back and
made me feel bettor in every way."
AT A LATER DATE, Mr. Taylor
said: "I willingly confirm all I have
ever said about Doan's Kidney Pills, 1
Etill think nightly of them."
Price 50c, at all dealers. Don't simp

NORTH CAROLINA FOR WEEKS
Strong Sentiment for Senator Among

' Raleigh, N. C, March 24. With the
choosing of R. W. Ward of Raleigh
and J. D. Parker of Smith field, as del
egates from the Fourth Congressional
District to the Chicago National Con
vention, it was declared today that
the State delegation is solid for Sena
tor Weeks for the Presidential nomin
ation. Neither the State nor district con
ventions have instructed their dele
gates, but the national committeeman,
the delegates at large, and the dele
gates from seven Congressional Dis
tricts arc in favor of the Massachu
setts Senator. Former National
Committeeman E. C. Duncan is one of
the delegates defeated in the conven

VILLA IS FLEEING
BEFORE FORGES OF
GEfj. PERSHING
Stopped Long Enough to Peat Band
of Carranza Troops
TRANSPORT QUESTION IS ACUTE
Pershing's Column is Now 300 Miles
From Border and Line to the
Rear Is Weak.
San Antonio, Tex., March 27. Fran
cisco Villa's escape from the region
about Namhiuiqa was preceded by a
smart defeat of a. part of tho Mexican
de facto government's troops and was
unopposed by other constitutionalist
detachments, according to unofficial
but credible reports reaching here to
day. ;
The cordon of Mexican troops that
the Mexican uutnorlties announced
would be drawn across his path, gave
way, according to reports, indicating
their cooperation with Villa rather
than with the American forces. Unit
ed States army men here were inclined
to believe reports of inefficiency and
half hearted cooperation.
Advices from General Pershing to
General Funston dealt only with rou
tine subjects, principally with the
transportation of supplies. The posi
ions of troops wero not revealed but
it was known American cavalry still
was riding hard along the traM of Villa
and, was rapidly nearing points 300
miles from the border,
f,
Itf was realized here thatthe earl
capture of Villa would be little better
uinnacciueniat.
With their knowlodge of jthe country
and with the assistance tiiey can pro
cure along the way, Villa and his follower-
it waa feared, will have little
lilneulty In keeping abend of the pur
suing Americans. Tho only hope for
an early ending of the ehase, It is felt
here, is that- Carranaa's troops will
check VillaVT flight or that Villa him
self, after Joining ono or more of his
wandering bands, may docide to fight.
That Villa will be able to effect n
function with a considerable force be
fore lie. is brought to a stand again is
-egarded at United States army head
quarter' here as probable. Canuto
Reyes, ne of his generals, who has
boon operating in the vicinity of Tor
reon, has a strong mobile force, and in
the state of Durango it is said the
Arrleta brothers are in a position to
move northward to his support.
Unofficial observers have offered a
theory that Villa, after joining these
uid others, will continue his movement
southward with tho hope of gathering
-Urpngth as ho goes and. with Zapata
and other enemies of the Carranza
government will attempt once more to
gain possession of Mexico City.
. PATROL SYSTEM FOR ROADS
To Be Emphasized at County Meeting,
April 4th.
One of the chief things to be con
F'dered at the Bennington County good
roads meeting in Bennington on April
4th is the 'Patrol System.'
One of the big questions which con
fronts every town in Bennington
County is: "How shall we maintain
our roads after we have built them?"
By the "Patrol System," certain stretch
es of the selected roads are taken in
charge by a special patrolman, who
gives his entire time to maintain them,
thus keeping the selected road in good
condition all the time and leaving the
road commissioner free to put more
time and attention on the remaining
roads. All of the extra expense in
curred' by the System is met by tho
State.
The advantages are so evident that
States are being placed under the sys
tem. In fact, the only reason why
many more roads are not so handled
is because it is as yet a new thing and
is not clearly understood.
The advantages are many. In the
first place it keeps tho road good oil
the time, and avoid the inconvenient
and expensive way of letting roads go
to pieces and then repairing them.
Tho patrolman gives his full time to
tho work, insuring that things will be
done when needed. The road com
missioner, not working full time, often
must look after his own affairs just
when he is most needed on the road.
It causes men on adjoining sections of
selected ronds to rival each other as
to whom can keep his road iu the bet
ter condition.
We often hear it said, "That road
needs fixing, a small expense now
would save a much bigger expense la
ter on," but still the road commission
er has no money with which to fix it
until another summer. Under the
Patrol System the road is kept up and
when the money is expended the
State foots the bills.
We ere very rapidly completing the
building of our main roads. The
problem now is to maintain them with
the least expense. This can bo at
tained best by the 'Patrol System.'
Not only rond commissioners and
selectmen, but all who are interested
in or use the roads should attend the
road meeting in Bennington, April 4.
VAGUE STORY THAT
END OF WAR MAY
BE AT
Peace Rumor in Guarded Dispatch
From Stockholm
BASIS OF DISCUSSION WANTED
President Wilson and King Gustave
Said to be Trying to Arrange
Meeting of Belligerents.
Stockholm, March 28. The meeting
of the allies war council at Paris this
week is said to have a bearing on pos
sible peac proposals.
It 1b allrfged, on the authority of the
ambassador ot neutral power, that Ger
many has' already made known to Col.
House of; the United States and to a
ifiartine Swedish statesman the terms
on which she would meet the allies in
discussing peace.
The same authority declares tnac tne
meeting In Paris is in part to discuss
Uie terms on which the allies would be
w illing to meet Germany and Austria in
an attempt to end the war. The result
w ill be communicated to King Gustave
of Sweden and President Wilson.
If the belligerents are not too far
apart in their demands It is expected
that Sweden and the United btates
will try to briug about a meeting of
representatives of tho powers at war
to see if peace terms can be reached.
It is said that all the nations in the
onfllct are tired of war and are will
ing to concede points which they held
to be vital earlier in the struggle. The
greatest difficulty is said to be to get
either party to make the first move
lest It be considered a sign of weak
ness. PARIS WAR COUNCIL
Leaders of Allies Meet to Plan For the
Future.
Paris. March 27. The conference of
the Entente Allies, the most important
since the outbreak of the war, began
this morning in the great salon of the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, where
many other historic meetings of diplo
mats have taken place. No previous
meeting there, however, has been of
such grave import or has been attend
ed by such a representation of world
figures in war arid diplomacy. The
table at which the conferees sit Is the
same one at which peace terms were
(discussed at tho close of the Spanish
Americun war.
The subject of the first sitting was
the military situation. That is all that
can he said definitely, but it is thought
likely that General Jofl're, Earl Kitch
ener, General Sir Douglas Haig, Lieut
Gen. Count Cadorna, General Castel
anu, and General Roques, the new
French War Minister, addressed the
conference.
The entire company took luncheon
at the Ministry at noon. The after
noon session was devoted to consider
ation of the economic resources of the
Allies.
$150,000 MORE FOR WILLARD
Champion to Go on Road with Circus
Will Not Retire.
Chicago,' March 27,. Jess Willard ar
rived fronr New York today with his
right hand in bandages. Otherwise he
showed no ill effects of his contest
with Frank Moran In New York Sat
urday night. "
The champion will remain with his
family here until he starts his season
with a circus April 29. It was said that
his contract with the circus calls for
$150,000.
"I did not knock out Moran because
a knockout would have a bad effect on
the fighting game in New York, and
there is enough feeling against it now,"
said Willard. "I don't intend to re
tire. I am not that much of a fool,
even if they do say things about me."
Willard grinned when asked if the
satchel he carried contained the money
he won.
"I've got some of It, all right," he
said, "aud Tom Jones is coming along
with the rest."
The champion was greeted by a
largo crowd at the station.
BASKET BALL ENDS
Y. M. C. A. Closes Season Tonight with
Big Game.
The last game of the season by any
of the local teams will be played in
the gymnasium tonight.
A close contest is predicted between
the "Y" first team and the No. Adams
Y. M. C. A. boys. The Massachusetts
boys gave the "Y" a bad beating re
cently, and it is hoped to hold them
down if not turn tables. To this end
there has been hard practice. At North
Adams the Bennington boys were with
out two of their best players. The
team will bo at its best tonight, and
will have the advantage of its own
floor.
A good preliminary will be played
between tho second team and the
North Bennington.
The capacity of the gymnasium is
limited and those who do not wish to !
stand should be on hand early.
