in Trenches on Both Sides Are Awaiting Call for In

The British and Germans have been
fighting fiercely in the region of St.
Elci, just south of Ypres, and the
British, through the explosion of a big
mine and by infantry charges, have
captured or destroyed a considerable
portion of the German trenches.
The British infantry stormed and
took first and second line trenches
along a front of six hundred yards,
London officially announces, and Ber
lin admits that German trenches in
this region were blown up, to an ex
tent of one hundred yards and that
"casualties were caused among the
company occupying the position."
Again the bombardment has become
intense to the northeast and north
west of Vedrun and considerable ac
tivity by the big guns has also been
shown in the Woevre, southeast of the
fortress. The time seemingly is npt
ripe, however, for an infantry attack
and the men of both sides have lain
idle in their trenches awaiting the
moment for an attack and counter-attack.
The Germans, after a period of com
parative quiet, have again begun shell

MAY PUT SUBMARINE
MATTER UP TO CONGRESS.
President Will Do So Before Taking
Any Decisive Action. I
Washington, March 27. The presi
dent is seriously considering going be
fore congress and laying the entire
question of submarine warfare before
the members of the senate and house.
Certainly he will communicate the sit
uation fully to congress before taking
an definite steps which might lead to
the severance of diplomatic relations.
All phases of the situation probably
would be discussed at the cabinet
meetin gtomorrow.
Official expression of the attitude of
the administration was avoided today,
but high officials made no attempt to
minimize the gravity of the situation
which will confront the United States
if it is established conclusively that a
German submarine sank the Sussex, an
unarmed, pea cef ul, passenger-carrying
vessel, In violation of the rights of hu
manity, thep rinciples of international
law and the solemn assurances regard
ing the conduct of submarine warfare
which have been given to the United
States by the central European pow
ers. Count Von Bernstorff, the German
ambassador, who, it was stated with
authority today, was chiefly responsi
ble for the retirement of Grand Ad
miral Von Tirpitz, has been out of
town for several days, but is expected
to return tomorrow. He probably will
communicate with Secretary Lansing
soon after his arrival.
The discovery ot a number of frag
ments of metal aboard the Sussex, in
cluding a large piece of bronze found
by a French naval officer, has been re
ported by Ambassador Sharp at Paris.
The naval efflcer, according to state
department despatches, says the piece
of bronze is a part of a torpedo.
DUTCH LINER TURBANTIA
WASSUNK BY TORPEDO.
Bronze Air Chamber Proves Conclu
sively It Was Made in Berlin.
Amsterdam, via London, March 27,
9.42 p. m. The Handelsblad says that
an expert Investigation proves conclu
sively that the Dutch liner Tubantia
was sunk by a torpedo with a bronze
air chamber, which is found only in the
Schwartzdoppf torpedoes made In Ber
lin. The torpedoes used in the British
and French navy, the newspaper says,
have steel air chambers. One of the
experts, suggests that the Turbantia
might have been torpedoed by a email
German torpedo boat whose station ia
Ostend.
The Handelsblad urges Holland to
Join the United States in demanding of
Germany that she will not torpedo
merchantmen without a preliminary
Investigation.

ent Duty Until 1920.

ocrats in caucus tonight voted to sub
stitute for the house resolution repeal
ing the free sugar, clause of the tariff
act a resolution extending the present
duty of a cent a pound until :920. The
vote on the substitute, which was rec
ommended by democratic members of
the finance committee, was 23 to 7.
Senators Broussard and Ransdell of
Louisiana vigorously opposed the sub
stitute, declaring that a four-year ex
tension was no assurance to Louisiana
sugar growers and producers and that
it would fail to restore activity to the
sugar industry m that state.
Five other democratic senators voted
with the Louisiana senators. It was
predicted that there would be a renew
al of the sugar fight when the senate
proposal was returned to the house for
concurrence.

SEVERE CRITICISM OF
LIFE BELTS ON SUSSEX
Rotten Tapes Broke as People Tried to
Put Them On.
Dover, March 28, 2.10 a. m. Some
severe criticism of the life belts on
the cross-channel steamer Sussetx and
of the conduct of some of the crew of
the vessel was made yesterday by C.
T. Crocker, an American survivor at
the inquest over the bodies of two
men and a woman who lost their lives
as a result of the explosion which
damaged the steamer.
Mr. Crocker said that after the ex
plosion there seemed to be a panic,
but that it quieted down in a quarter
of an hour. He saw some people try
ing to put on life belts but the tapes
broke as they were absolutely rotten.
He put belts on two women and the
same thing happened. After a time
the crew brought out new lift belts,
which were better. The rotten ones
were hanging on the rails of the boat.
After the explosion, Mr. Crocker tes
tified, he saw one boat hanging from a
broken rope and people in the water.
One end of the boat was hanging in
the air and the other just touching
the water. There was a terrible ruin
for the boats which were overloaded
and some .persons had to be got out
of them. He saw many persons in the
water, to whom rafts or ropes were
thrown. Two or three of them were
pulled out of the sea.
In the fore part of the vessel Mr.
Crocker saw many persons who had
been wounded and some who were
dead. He assisted in giving aid to the
Injured.
"Did everybody behave well durin;
the accident?" the coroner asked of
Mr. Crocker.
"The crew," replied Mr. Crocker.
"d!d not appear very efficient. Some
or them got champagne and the offl
cers had to take it awav."
"Were there life belts enough for
ail :
"Yes."
"Yes."
At the close of the inquest the cor
oner said there would be an inauirv bv

the accident and particularly into the
matter or the lire preservers.

Embargo on Raw Material.
Washington, March 27,-i-A resolu
tion for an investigation of the news
print paper situation by the Depart
ment of Commerce was introduced in
the house today by Representative
Copley, of Illinois. Much of the sup
ply of raw material for print paper
that came from Germany, Norway and
Sweden was cut off by the war, and
other material is being shipped from
this country to Europe for use in the
manufacture of munitions, the resolu
tion says. An opinion is asked, on the
advisability of placing an embargo
on raw material. '
According to Mr. Copley, the price
of paper has advanced so far that the

EVIDENCE INDICATES
SUSSEX WAS TORPEDOED
President Wilson is Awaiting Receipt
of Conclusive Evideno.
Washington, March 27. With all ev
idence indicating that the British
channel steamer Sussex. carrying
American citizens, was the victim ot
a torpedo, it was stated authoritative
ly here today that if a German subma
rine made the attack the imperial gov
ernment would disavow the act. pun
ish the submarine commander, offer
reparation and satisfy the. United
States. This, it seemed tonight, that
the issue might narrow down to the
question of whether the United States
would be wiling to accept such a
declaration from the Berlin govern
ment. President Wilson is awaiting
with deep concern the receipt of con
clusive evidence not only in regard to
the Sussex, aboard which several
Americans narrowly escaped death,
but as to the sinking of the British
steamship Englishman. One life is
said in the latest official reports to
have been lost when the Englismhman
went down.
Already, it was Intimated at the
state department, the United States
has information sufficient to warrant
tne making of an inquiry of the Ger
man government as to whether any
of its submarines fired a torpedo at
the Sussex or the Englishman.
The president, however, feels that

While public opinion is pessimistic

It is pointed out the bandit has never
had to match his generalship against
