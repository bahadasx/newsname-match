j is the opinion of William P. Houseal j
j of Columbia, known somewhat more |
l than locally ;is the "Dutch weather
prophet."
Mr. Houseal said yesterday:
"Seasons of abundant precipitation
will prevail throughout the spring and J

"lie.se periods ar^ from -1 to 24 days j
apart. It has usually been believed j
that these changes were governed al-i
together by the lunar periods of seven!
days or multiples of this number up !
to 2S. The pulsations of the sun. in j
connection with the propelling power j
of the planets in their varying po- j
sitions with the earth and the sun, are j
no doubt the cause o:' the varying pe-j
riods of precipitation, heat and co'd. !
Had for Fibre Crops.
I
"On this basis the indications lead to;
the forecast that the spring and summer
of 1916 will not lack for sufficient
moisture to produce herbaceous cropr,
that is, it will be a 'vegetable year,1
similar to 191 r?. Field crops are included
in this forecast.
"A prediction for a big cotton crop
is left out of the question; it will not j
be a good year for fibre crops. An?
economic problem enters largely this
year in the production of a large cottcn
crop. Being a care'ul student of
meteorological and economic conditins
! must come to the conclusion that they
produce normally, the same results. Tn
a forecast last year it was predicted
that the cotton crop for 1915-16 would
show a decrease of one-fourth as compared
to the previous year. It was a
plain case of too much moi6ture for
fl-iQ fiVuvrm c thf? mnsfr tJPD- !
tilt ilUi VliO V/WWll UiUtt V, bitv WW ?
sitive plant physcially that grows on
the earth. The cotton crop for the
present year^ governed by practically
the same meteological conditions will
be the same size approximately as last
year.
"While precipitation will be abundant,
it is not apprehended that freshets
of a serious character will prevail
this year, 1
"The winter has not entirely gone,
although the trees of Columbia are
beginning to don their dress of refreshing
greem. The temperature
around April 14-17 will be a reminder
of similar days in March when in some
sections of the country the weather
was the coldest since 1871. Forty-two
years ago. April 19. recorded temperatures
in South Carolina as low as
March 16, 1916, and killed the
fruit and vegetables entirely. Similar
meteorological periods are recurring
at this time, the intervals being the
same for the years as for the days?ine
numbers 21 to 24.
"Tbis period of lower temperature
will be followed at Easter by much
warmer wpather: indeed, the 'Dutch
weather prophet' makes the forecast
for ideal weather at that season, contrary
to the almost universal opinion
that there is 'always a cold spell at
Easter.' It is not true that cold weath r
always prevails at Easter. Ine
I records will prove that the weather at
Easter, one year compared to anotner.
is as variable as it is at any other season."
School Gardens.
Ko-h erarle at Spears Street school
has a garden plot on the school
grounds which is being cultivated by
the children, directed by the teachers.
Mr. L. W. Floyd has recently shown
his interest in this work by giving
them a sack of commercial fertilizer.
There are forty-three garden plots
being cultivated by the pupils of the
Mollohon Mill school. Any one would
i
be inspired to see tne interest 01 mese
children and teachers in their work.

AUDUBON SOCIETY AT
BOrXDRY STKEET SCHOOL
The Dublic would be surprised to!
see the great and growing interest in !
the work of the Audubon society at I
the Boundary Street school. When J
Miss Mabry, principal of the school, j
started the work among the children j
last year, there was manifested a no- j
ticeable indifference to the idea ofstudying
birds and an aversion to the
suggestion that birds ought to be cared
for and protected rather than shot at
and killed.
But there has been wrought a complete
reversion of opinion. One has

of birds' nests, cocoons, and otfrer
specimens from nature, compositions
on birds, illustrations, etc., have been
collected and to see the many bird
houses built by che children themselves
is to appreciate their present remarkable
enthusiasm for the subject of
bird study and bird preservation.
Each grade in turn from the third to
the se.enth has the pleasure of rendering
a program for the weekly meetings.
All the grades have prepared
valuable and interesting exercises
consisting of bird lore, 'poems and
stories about birds, the habits of different
kinds o>: birds, the value of birds,
and the history of certain species of

THOROUGHBRED CATTLE
FOR THE FA RIMERS
The Commercial bank displayed its
herd of cows, that was shipped in last
week, on the public square on Satur
licLj i iit'ic <xiv ^luv^ii nut; Lieiit;ro
and the big Ked Poll bull and the
heifers are a fine specimen of the
thoroughbred cow and the only kind
that the farmer of this section should
use. It combines the quality of beef
with that of the milker.
Several of them have been taken
but there are some left. The Commercial
bank has gone to the trouble to
tret these hei.ers and is offering them
to the farmers of the county at actual
cost in an honest and praiseworthy
eiiori 10 neip ana encourage tne larmers
of this county to improve their
stock and to engage in the cattle business.
If the efforts of the bank meet with
the approval and encouragement it
should President Kinard says he has
made arrangements to secure some
more or toese ueners at cost ior any
farmer who may desire to improve his
stock and his condition generally.
NEGRO SHOOTS ANCfTHEIt

Sunday afternoon about 7 o'clock
Sheriff Blease received a phone message
that a negro shooting had taken
place in lower No. y township on the
Holly Ferry road. He and Deputies
Taylor and Melton immediately left
for the scene and in a short time were
there.
Wade Davenport had shot Tom
Wheeler twice, one ball entering above
the thigh and going into the cavity and
the other going into the abdomen. The
two negroes had been to Mt. Hebron
church and while walking along the
public highway began a quarrel about
some tobacco and Wheeler made after
Davenport with a drawn knife and Davenport
returned the attack with two
shots from his pistol, < '
Wheeler was taken to a Columbia
hospital and it is said his chances of
recovery are very slim. Davenport

There were quite a number of persons

quite livelp.
The stock was purchased by ?Mir. >
S. Solomon of Marion, for $4,400. It
has been turned over to the Western
Sales and Salvage company who will
begin a sale of the entire stock on
Saturday, April 1. They will sell the
stock at from 40 to -"0 cents on the

Xewberry for a time at least.
The Early Closing of the Stores.
will the merchant^ again begin tire
early closing of their stores for tne
summer months? It is hoped that all
the Newberry merchants will agree
to do this, thus giving rest and time
for some recreation i.'or those in their
employ.
This has been done for t?vo years
and has proved to be quite satisfactory.
