Few Days.
LITTLE MARAUDING
BY BANDIT GANGS
Carranza Troops Give No
Signs of any Serious
Breaks.
Field Headquarters, American Ex
peditionary Forces, Oolonia, Dublan,
Chihuahua, March 28.—(By aeroplone
to Colunibus. N. M.)—Mexicans every
where during the first days of the
Mexican advance kept much out of
sight. Now, however, Mexican trad
ers are beginning to come out to the
camps. These Mexicans, under hats
with brims nearly a. yard wide, a
shawl about equal proportions draped
over them like a cape, and a basket of
one bushel capacity hooked in one
arm, are spied at great distances as
they approach the camp and are made
welcome by the shouts of the sol
diers. They carry back to the towns
reports of cordial treatment and will
ingness to pay ready oash. In a few
days the army's monthly pay Is due,
releasing many thousands of dollars
among then who have had no chance
to spend money for what the soldiers
say has been an "immense long time."
The presence of this spending mon
ey is likely.to be a strong factor In es
tablishing friepdly relations between
the army and the people of the state
Of Chihuahua. At any event. It will
be an event, the like of which, has
not occurred here in'the-memory of
the old-time inhabitants.
Little Marauding.
On the long communication line. It
is said, nothing worse has been en
countered that a little marauding by
professional bands who haye not fired
a shot at any troops. One of the
aeroplanes, which flew too far upon
its .entry into Mexico and which had
to be left in the hills for nearly two
days, was visited by Mexicans suppos
ed to be bandits, who robbed the ma
chine of numerous appliances, but
who did not offer to destroy or seri
ously damage the plane' itself. Some
of the scientific instruments which
they took could hardly be of value in
a. bandit's trade, but seem to have
been taken out of curiosity. On two
or three occasions wires of the con
stitutionalist telegraph lines have
been cut, so that on the face of things
the marauding has been directed
about equally against the constitu
tionalist and American property.
Seiaed Young Men.
For two weeks the reports along
Villa's trail show that he has seized
the young men and boys of small
towns. His custom has been for eith
er himself or one of his lieutenants to
line up most of the male population
for inspection. The best physical
specimens have been pulled out of line
and told roughly that they were hon
ored above the others, because they
became "Villa men." In the Casas
