For the first time since the dawn
of statehood, the admissions to the
county jail have broken all previous
records for any one month.
During the month of Marcli there
have been admitted to the county jail
just 80 prisoners to serve sentence
passed by the court. Of that number
33 still remain behind the bars, while
a number have been drafted for ser
vice on the country road between this
city and the oil fields.
Yesterday work on the road from
the city limits west was begun, and
there Is also a demand for workers on
the roaid between this city and Spring
er by way of the country club and city
lake. The county attorney states that
so far as he is concerned that he
vants to see every prisoner physically
able at work on the county roads and
eliminate much of this subscription
money that the business men of the
city have been compelled to put up in
the past in wrder to get the roads
worked at all.
The county officials determined
some time ago that any man without
visible means of support was giing
to be given a job, and it has had a
wholesome effect on a lot of the in
dividuals who never have been con
victed of an honest day's work. There
is a lot of road work to be done in
the county this summer, and unless
the "Vags" get busy, they are going
to contribute a lot of labor toward do-

deserted her five small children yes
terday and tied the country with an
other man, according to a statemen
of Mrs. Curtis, probation officer, this
morning, as she left her office to
make arrangements for the mainten
ance of the children.
Mrs. Curtis states that the husband
of this woman was in the hands of
the law and in jail for larceny, and
that the children were in absolute
destitute circumstances. She will
take charge of them and see what
can be done toward securing a home
for them.
The Benevolent Society has had
a number of destitute cases to con
tend with the past winter. Many
families moved to this city after the
