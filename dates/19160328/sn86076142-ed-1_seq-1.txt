The pleasure of providing a good
play ground has only begun in our
city, if plans already laid are to ma
terialize. The most recent step In thiB
direction is the . setting up of the
slides; one straight and rather small,
another larger and with "bump the
blimps" style of Incline. There has
been no end of fun wfih the new ap-
pratus and both slides appeal almost
equally to older and younger children.
By placing the slides In such a re
lation to the sand bins that the child
ren land lu the soft sand, all danger
of liruiaes has been eliminated.
The plana for repairing some of
the old apparatus, as well as for buy
ing new, have been niade. The giant
stride and the swings, both may be
used with small outlay of time and
money. A little work in spading or
loosening the ground will provide a
safe landing for proad and high
