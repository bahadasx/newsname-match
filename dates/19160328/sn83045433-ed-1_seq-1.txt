It has not been positvely determined
front State Department reports that the
Sussiex was tortedoed. The bulk of evi
dence points, however., to a submarine
attack. Three Americans in affidavits
to the State Department swear they
saw tlh- wake of the torpedo.
The United States consul at Boulogne
said he had been advised by a French
officer that a piece of bronze, believed
to te part of a torpedo, had been found
in the hull of the Sussex.
Cireumstantial Evidence.
The Ftate. Department will act on cir
runtantai, eriente if it is unable to
estabulsh '. direct evidence that the
S i-x was torpedoed. This was at
noI-ed aulhoritatively.

i-t." L hiih official saidt. "A man's
e, e mia- I... wrong, but circumstances
are ne wron:"
It was stat-I I ;st as emphatically that
the tnWd States will not insist on evi
denes of the nationality of the subma
if it is established that the vessel
was torpedoed. The State Department
asSjumi s it to be a fact that only Ger
mary has been operating submarines in
the waters around the Brltish Isles.
it was pointed out. however, that the
fact the State Department is ready to
act on circumstantial evidence and with
cit evidence of the nationality of the
submarine does not mean it is prejudg
ing the case.
Stil Consider Mine Theory.
Secretary of State Lansing is not at
all cgtain from evidence now before
him that the Sussex was torpedoed.
The mine theory has not yet been dis
posed of.
Naval officers, whose opinions have
been asked, indicate that the ftet the
vessel was struck in the bow creates
the presumption that it struck a mine.
Ambassador Sharp, in a cable yester
day, informed the State Department
that the route taken by the Sussex
from Folkatore to Dieppe is the only
one that has been open to neutral pas
sengers. They have not been permit
ted to cross the Chhanel via the Bou
logne-Folkestone or Havre-Southamp
ton routes. The closing of these routes
was presumed to have been taken as
a precautionary measure owing to the
presence of mines.

"We started south eight days ago,"
