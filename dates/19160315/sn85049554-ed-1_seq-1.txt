Quiet at Juarez,
Rumors of the advance of the pimi

calm of Juarez today. The garrison

usual. Even General Gutierrez's de

three box cars, the soldiers riding on

from Presidio, Tex.,* that the Carranza
garrison at Ojlnaga has revolted and
murdered its commander, General

The stories brought from the Interior
of (Mexico by Carranaa refugees served
to confirm the impression that at least
a section of the Carranaa soldiery were
far from unfriendly to Villa and were
decidedly hostile to the American ex
pedition. Refugees told of being in
sulted and 'cursed by soldiers in their
flight.

At the same time other Americans,

that conditions there were quiet end

of anamosity towards either the United

available for any development.

brought home more clearly to th®
