Mrs. Yates Better.
F-
L
il
Popalar Couple Wed.
Last Tuesday forenoon, at the 11
o'clock hour, Mr. Jo Knifley, assistant
cashier of the Bank of Columbia, and
Miss Elva MurreU, of the Zlon com
munity, ,ani who has been a popular
teacher in the county for several
years, were quietly married at the
home of Mr. and Mrs, Josh Butler.
Key. O. P. Bush, in an impressive
manner, performed the ceremony.
There were no attendants, and only a
few friends were present.
Immediately arter the union, the
couple left for Taylor county, to spend
a few days with the groom's sister,
Mrs. J. A. Sanders.
This wedding was not a surprise, as
the young couple had been keeping
company for the past two years, and
it was generally believed that the
courtship would terminate in mar
riage. We know of no young man who has
conducted himself more manly than
Jo Knifley. Strictly reliable and at
tentive to business, courteous in all
his bearings, has made him friends
throughout the county.
The bride has been a popular teach
er for several jears and has many
friends among the younger set. She is
a daughter of Leslie Murrell, deceas
ed, and was born and reared in the
Zion neighborhood, where her manner
of living won the admiration of the
entire community.
The couple will reside in Columbia.
Tuesday night, the first part of the
"Broken Coin," the greatest of the
great American Serials, will be shown
at the Parlor Circle, absolutely free.

Prehistoric.
A few evenings ago, while a com
pany of gentlemen were seated in Dr.
J. N. Page's drug-store, talking of in
cidents of long ago, Mr. J. F. Mont
gomery related the following: "A
number of years ago" he said, "a man
named Phillips was in Wayne and
Russell counties, hunting up relics of
prehistoric times, and on Cumberland
river, in Russell county, near the
Wayne line, he found an opening in a
cliff. He entered it and discovered
any number of skeletons, evidently
those of Indians, or bones of some
race of people who had been put to
death before history was written.
There were several hundred of these
skeletons, and Phillips, the discover
er, was of the opinion that the men
whose bones remained, were pitched
in the cavern from above, as in look
ing up he discovered light from a large
hole Phillips brought two of the
skulls he found to Monticello, and I
was in the town at the time. One of
the men was killed with an Indian ar
row, as che point of the arrow was in
the skull, showing that it had pene
trated the brain."

formation that Mr. J H. Young, who

over, this year, Mr. Barger will erect a
handsome two-story residence.
There has been some petty thievery
going on in this town for some time.
It is said there is a line on the guilty
parties, and you need not be surprised
to hear of the door of the house of
reformation being thrown open.

Whereas God in His infinite wisdom
and goodness has seen fit to call from
our midst our beloved pastor and faith
ful, spiritual adviser, Bev. S. K. Breed
ing, be it therefore, Resolved:
First. That in his death the church
and community at Elkhorn, Ky., are
sorely bereaved indeed. The church
at large may well recognize the fact
that "A prince and a great man in
our community, Isreal is fallen this
day." What a force, what a blessing'
to any community to have such men
as he to live in their midst. When he
left us we felt as did one of old when
he looked in the face of the dying
prophet and exclaimed: "My father,
my father, the chariots of Isreal and
the horsemen thereof." We shall miss
the inspiration of his presence, the
wisdom and counsel of his matuie
judgment and even temperature, that
the old and ycung alike have lost a
generous benefactor, that the dis
couraged in spirit have lost a cheering
comforter.
Second. That we tender our sin
cere sympathy to his sorrowing com
panion and entire family in the loss
of this noble man of God, and that we
commit them to Him "Who doeth all
things well."
Third. That a copy of these resolu
tions be sent the family, that a copy
be mailed to the Central Methodist,
the Adair County News and the News
Journal for publication, and that a
copy be preserved as a part of the per
manent record of the church here

Pigeons Carry Hog Cholera.
. Pigeons are responsible for about 20
per cent., of the spread of hog cholera
according to the authorities who are
dealing with its eradication. The
farmer who owns or harbors pigeons
should either confine them at home or
dispose of them. Pigeons fly from
farm to farm in search of food which
they generally find in the feed yards
In flying long distances and visiting
many yards they easily get the germs
on their feet and infect a whole neigh
borhood before people realize that
cholera is in their herds. In 1915 the
loss from hog cholera in the United
States was estimated at $750,000,000,
and if one fifth of this can be attrib
uted to pigeons, they will have to go.
Stray Hogs.
I have 5 stray hogs that left my
farm in September. Four of them
have a hole in right ear. The other
one not marked. Will pay a reward.

The money for building the new
Methodist church at Jamestown has
been subscribed and the work will
commence as soon as fair weather sets
in. Mr. Josh Chumbley has com
menced the erection of a new cottage
in the same town which will be com
pleted at an early day. Jamestown is
getting the right move, and the way
improvements are being made, the
old town will not be recognized in a
few more years.
Building lots are very scarce in Co
lumbia. In fact there is no room for
the erection of residences inside the
corporate limits unless streets are
opened. If a street was run through,
from the Greensburg road to the Glas
gow road, perhaps a half hundred nice
building lots could be laid off,
Mr. -L. C.Hindman and family, who
have been living at Sonora, Hardin
county, have returned to Columbia,
and are occupying Mrs. Johnson's res
idence on Greensburg street. Our
people are glad that they are again
residents of Columbia.
In the list of land advertised to
be sold for taxes, the name of Rev. R.
H. Tyree appeared last week. That
was a mistake, and' it was made in
this office, not by the sheriff.
The Baptist people of Columbia had
a social gathering at their church last
Tuesday night Hot chocolate and
coffee were served and the evening de
lightfully spent.

Editor News:
I am glad to note that we feel sure
that Mrs. Yates is better. Notwlth
standing we know that organic kidney
trouble is hard to control. The doc
tors and nurse all agree that she is
surely improving. I thank my
friends and relatives of Adair for all
their nice letters and cards of love
and sympathy, but Maggie Nell's
takes the cake. Her post card con
tained 226 words and over 900 letters
and full of love all the way through.
We are having the worst winter for
work we ever had. Our farmers have
not done any work at all for spring,
and it looks as the winter would not
let go at all, still that is not as bad as
the war. If we can escape the war,
we can stand the bad weather.
Thanks again to-day friends.
Respt,
J. C. Yates.

Teacher's Salary Held Back".
Because the law prevents the trans
fer of fines and forfeitures, dog tax
and other revenues, amounting to sev
eral hundred thousand dollars, to the
State school fund until the end of the
fiscal year, June 30, State Superin
tendent Y. O. Gilbert stated that he
will be able to make only a partial dis
tribution of the March payment for
teachers.
The teasury will disburse for this
purpose about 8190,000 this month.
The total amount of the March dis
tribution is $565,000 and the balance
will be paid in June.
This is the first year of the seven
months' term. The first six distribu
tions were made promptly and there
is sufficient in the treasury to meet
the March distribution; but under the
law it cannot be transferred to the
credit of the school fund before the
end of the year, when there probably
will be a small surplus to apply on the
next school year.
The estimated school revenues for
the year were 34,147,222.89. The to
tal amount credited to the school fund
up to March 1 wa3 83,660.342.48, of
which $3,423,544.37 had been distribu
ted to the cities and counties, leaving
a balance at that date of $936,693 1L.

The contractfora Methodist Church
to be built at Jamestown, Ky., will be
let to the lowest and best bidder on
Wednesday March 22nd, 1916.
Any one desiring to bid can call at
the Bank of Jamestown, and see the
BluePrint.
All material will be furnished on
the sight and the work to begin at
once. J. H. Phelps,
Chairman of Building Com.
Squire W. G. Ellis, of Pellyton, was
in Columbia Monday. In conversa
tion with him concerning the build
ing of the Stanford road, we find that
he favors letting a contract for the
grade work. He stated that the coun
ty could furnish the tools and machin
ery now owned and let the contract
for the grade and therefore would be
relieved from difficulties that could be
better handled by a contractor. Should
the Court decide on such a course at
its April meeting some week or three
weeks time would be necessary for ad
vertising but in the long run we feel
that it would be time well spent. If
a contract for the grade is let the
court would be greatly relieved and
the money to be used on the road
would doubtless build more road for
most men will stir to better advan
tage on the job rather than by the
day or hour. This suggestion of Mr.
Ellis is worth serious consideration
by every member of the court.
Last week, we stated upon informa
tion furnished us by a Russell county
citizen, that the Dixie Highway
bridge would span Cumberland river

informed by a writer of Snow, Ky.,
that the Fiscal Court of Clinton,
county had voted against the Rowena
crossing. The writer failed to sign
his name. It his statement is correct,
he certainly ought to have fathered
his information
