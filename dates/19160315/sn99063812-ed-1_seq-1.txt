tho topic of Robert E; Strahorn's ad
dress at the Irrigation, drainage and
rural credits conference at Salem, i
Mr. Strahorn'a address was ono of tho I
few really constructive addresses de-l
llvercd at the conference, and shows (
clearly how reclamation of wet lands -
nnd arid lands would greatly stimu
late tho state's prosperity. Mr. Stra
horn said:
"I have no thought or nuthority to.
sicnk for any railway Interests except ,
the one so near my heart In Central,
Oregon. However, bearing In mind
that thousands of miles of, railways
are largely dependent for their reve
nue upon privately Irrigated lands,
that tho crops grown In 1915 on gov
ernment reclamation projects alone
totaled 130,000 carloads, and that the
prosperity, Improvement and exten-j
slon of our transportation systems
are so dependent upon the working
out of these development problems, I
will necessarily Indulge In observa
tions Involving them generally. The
great and highly profitable agricul
ture of Colorado, tTtahNew Mexico
and Arfcona, which' is entirely by irr
igation, furnished a large share of
the traffic of their scores of prosper
ous railways.
"With tho Southern Pacific's loss
of over $l,at0,000 from operation of
Its Oregon lines last year, with small
er though Important losses by the
Hill systems In Oregon, and largely
diminished earnings on the Oregon
lines of other roads, in spite of their
Important outlays for betterments of
a class from which no additional earn
ings can be expected, and In view of
their now almost unbearable load of
taxation, they are no doubt all casting
around anxiously for some means of
relief.
"May they not And an Important
measure of tnls In the matter we are
hero to seriously consider, and I
trust.to wisely promote? I ennne
Imagine the creation from any single
source of such a tide of prosperity
and such a volume of Increased traffic
as would spring from the doubling
of the productivity of Western Ore
gon's 3,000,000 acres of wet lands.
The accruing benefits would seem to
bo out of all proportion to the cost.
"Engineers roughly figure the cost
of drainage of these lands at 45 to
$10 per acre, and of tiling where the
latter may be necessary at from $15
to $20 per acre, say $25 per acre for
complete reclamation. Properly Is
Bued, state guaranteed long-time
drainage bonds would be as sound as
gold dollars and sell at such low in
terest rate and on such liberal terms
of repayment 'that the benefits could
readily be utilized to meet them.
"Our expert farmers estimate In
creased yields after drainage from 50
to 100 per cent, or easily sufficient tql
pay tho entire expense in inree or iour
years. Dratnago Is the nest perma

Instead of the minimum yielding and

"Providing It can be financed, this
looks good for the farmer. But what
about Its effects nn the railroads and
development generally? Take the
Willamette Valley alone, which Is as
well served by railroads as average
similar areas In Illinois and Iowa.
"Under present conditions this
wonderful vale of the Willamette, the
pride of the Pacific, deducting Its
handful of Kill lands la fruit and Its
mere speck of bottom lands in hops,
produces less tonnage, acre for aero,

country or the Walla Walla uplands.
Large areas of the wst, soar lands are

With nn increased production of
only 50 per cent on tho 1,000,000
acres of Willamette Valley wet Innds
alone. Increased tonnage of that
amount from that source and In
creased prosperity, activities and traf
fic of all kinds, It Is not hard to figure
where industrial and general pros
perity would be vastly enhanced and
an Important part of that railroad de
ficit would be wiped out. What could
do. more to fill up our over-built cities
and create the tonnage that would
bring ships to our docks?
"When wo built the Portland, Eu
gene & Eastern it was confidently ex
pected that ways would be devised to
drain tho great areas of wet lands
between Corvnllls and Eugene espe
cially.. That would have insured a
profltablo traffic and greatly encour
aged the completion and electrifica
tion of thto entire system.
"But efforts for drainage failed,
and tho railway project still lan
guishes In part. Miles upon miles of
that beautiful, level territory is far
less productive today than when first
settled fifty or sixty years ago, and
will continue depreciating under the
present conditions.
Tbe Oregon Electric and Southern
Pacific are furnishing the best railway
facilities in the country to many thou
sand of acres of such lands almost in

There are numerous other similar ex
