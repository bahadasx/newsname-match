S. O. S. CALLS ARE SENT OUT IN
ALL DIRECTIONS. ABOUT $3000

College Board Feels Confident That
The Money will be Forthcoming.
Friends are Flocking to the
Rescue. Victory is in
The Air.
North Star College's campaign is
drawing to a close and victory is in
sight altho not yet absolutely certain
Some promises to help have not yet
materialized and may fail at the criti
cal moment. Nearly $3000 remain to
be raised during the next two or
three days. Now is the time to come
to the rescue of vour home institu
tionyour own school. Many who
have not yet previously had a chance
to help should come in at the eleventh
hour and they will receive the same
rewardthe satisfaction of having
dene a good deed.
The various committees and the col
lege board are working harder than
ever to raise funds The Ladies Aid
of the Swedish Luth. Church* have
pledged $500 and Luther League, the
young peoples society, $200 The
Vasa lodge will come in with about
$600 The small Immanuel congrega
tion in northern Vega has raised
about $1500 among its members and
Alvarado and vicinity over $2,500
Wherever the Board has gone in quest
of funds it has found a willingness
to contribute that has been remark
able. Everybody is glad to help save
the school. Now let us all together
make a last mighty effort and the
goal is reached, the victory won.
Don't be afraid to bring your mite
everything helps in this final wind
up. Next week we hope to be able to
say that North Star College has se
cured Hon James J. Hill's donation
of $9,000 and is free from debt.

North Star College Notes
Prof. Sjostrand is out on the road
in the interest of the school. We
miss the "Man at the helm," and will
be glad when he is with lis again.
Mr. Schenck has charge of the
work in the Commercial Department
during Prof. Sjostrand's absence.
Every channel is being pursued in
the effort to bring the campaign to a
successful close n^xt Satnrdav. The
members of the Board of Directors
are spending th* greater part of their
time on the road, only dropping in
from time to time to deliver the en
couraging news that their efforts are
mopf'Tic with marked success
Enthusiasm over the outcome of
the campaign is at high ebb and will
undoubtedly find its expression in a
celebration the likeof which North
Star College has never seen, when
news that we have been successful is
given to the public
Probably one of the most success
ful ventures of the campaign for
funds for the school was that of the
Warren Commercial Club Committee.
Never before, in the history of our
little city, have the citizens so opened
their hearts and purees a* they did
during the past week when they
rallied to the support of North Star
by raising in a remarably short time
a sum of over $7,000. When we
think of the liberality with which the
helping hand was extended, we can
not help but believe that some gave
almost beyond their means. Thanks!
Hearty thanks, generous and good
willed citizens of Warren! The Lord
loves the cheerful giver, and rewards
tenfold
We hereby wish to express our ap
preciation of the untiring efforts of
Messrs. J. J. Olson, O. H. Taralseth,
Aug. A. Johnson and H. Wood, the
committee that raised the beforemen
tioned sum. Judging from the vim
and enthusiasm with which they
pushed their work, we are led to be
lieve that they were led on by a
banner bearing the inscription* "Our
cause, it is just, and in God is
trust." Thanks, Gentlemen, thanks!
At a meeting of the Commercial
Club last Thursday evening, Mr, ou
Julius J. Olson made a reporTon thej
work of the Citizens Committee. In I
well chosen and eloquent words he
applauded the ready response on the
pariTof the citizens of Warren when
asked to help the cause. He ended
with a stirring tribute to our college.
In a fitting manner Prof. Sjostrand
and Mr. C. A Nelson, of the State
Bank responded Rev. N. Ander
son also, in behalf of the members of
the Board, expressed their apprecia
tion and thanks. Long live the War
ren Commercial Club!
Next Friday evening a Basket
Social will beheld at North Star fori
Commercial Club Meeting.
A special meeting of the Warren
Commercial Club was held on the
evening of March 9. The committee
on raising funds for North Star Col
lege, consisting of O. H. Taralseth,
Julius J. Olson, H. L. Wood and Aug.
A. Johnson, reported thru Mr. Olson,
that the entire amount of $9,000,
which the club had undertaken to
raise as the city's quota, had already
been subscribed. This good piece of
news was hailed with the greatest
satisfaction and caused a great deal
of enthusiasm Prof. Sjostrand on
behalf of the college extended pro
found thanks to the committee for its
most excellent work and C. A. Nelson
in a neat speech on behalf of the
club moved a vote of thanks to the
committee, said motion being passed
unanimously by a rising vote. Rev.
Anderson, the solicitor for the college
also expressed his appreciation for
the good work done.
Next the Board of Education ap
peared before the club with a view of
ascertaining the sentiment of the
club as to encurring indebtedness for
the building of the new school house,
beyond the amount of the bonds
voted by the district. Mr. Lamber
son, president of the Board, explained
that the bids for the new building,
opened that dav, had far exceeded the
cauculations of the board, the high
bids being attributed to the constant
ly rising prices of building material.
The lowest bid was in the neighbor
hood of $58,000 for the completed
building. The consensus of opinion
was that Warren should have an up
to-date and fully equipped high
school building regardless of cost and
a motion was passed to the effect
that the club would back the school
board in any action they would take
to secure such a building.

WARREN, MARSHALL COUNTY, MINNESOTA, WEDNESDAY, MARCH 15, 1916.
MARSHALL COUNTY
ASSESSORS MEET
Over Thirty-five Present at School for
Assessors Conducted at Court
House Thursday by State Tax
Commission. The assessors of the county held a
meeting at the court house on the 9th
of March for the purpose of conferr
ing with the tax commission in re
gard to their duties under the laws of
the state
Mr. Lord, chairman of the commis
sion, was present and explained fully
all of the laws governing an asses
sor's duties. He reminded them that
they had taken an oath to perform
their duties in accordance with the
laws of the state and urged them to
be true to this solemn obligation. He
said that "tax paying can probably
never be made a pleasant duty but
if taxpayers could feel fairlv certain
that their tax money was honestly
handled and wisely spent, and that
the property of their neighbors was
assessed the same as their own would
probably hear less murmuring and
fewer complaints.
"The assessment laws of the state
now requires that household goods
and wearing apparel shall be assess
ed at 25 per cent of their true and
full value in money merchandise,
farm products, live stock, machinerv
of kinds and farm land* at 33 1-3
ner cent of their value and all other
propertv including platted village and
city real estate, and bank stock at 40
per cent of its full value.
"It is so clear that it is self-evident
that if the propertv of every taxpay
er in every taxing district in the state
wa! placed on the assessment books
and valued according to the same
rule the result would be a fair and
uniform assessment all over the state:
and this is just what will happen if
the propertv of everv citizen is asses
sed according to law. We are think
ing, therefor", that the law must
carried out by every assessor just as
it is written.

amounts of
inevitably be high, but the
ey shall be spent The amount of
money to be raised by taxation is de
termined by town meetings, school
meetings, village and city councils,
countv board, the legislature and by
the people themselvesnot by the as
sessor
"There will be raised in this state
this year by direct taxation for school,
road, local, county and state purposes
the enormous sum of $52,000,000.
Whether the assessor does his work
well or whether he does it poorly, and
whether he lists all of the property
in his district or only part of it, prac
tically all of this very large amount
of money will be raised just the same.
Except as to a very small fraction of
this amount nothing that the assessor
can do will add to or subtract from it
a single penny.
"But while the assessor has prac
tically nothing to do with making the
taxes of a community high or low he
has nearly everything to do with
making them fair and just. From the
standpoint of the individual taxpayer
he is the most important officer who
has anything to do with taxation. If
he complies with his oath of office
and does his work in the way that the
law provides, approximate justice will
prevail among all of the taxpayers of
his district but if on the other hand
he departs from the standard fixed
by law, or if he omits any consider
able amount of property from his list
his assessment will inevitably abound
in the grossest inequalities and result
in the rankest injustice. Taxpayers
whose property is not all listed and
assessed will pay less than their
share, and taxpayers whose property
is all assessed will pay more than
they ought to.
"In nearly every community tax
dodging is resorted to most by people
who are best able to pay. It is not
*he citizen of limited means whose
p~~perty is all in sight and easily
found by the assessor who escapes.
Such people as a rule pay taxes on
every dollar's worth of property they
have in the world. It is among peo
pie with bulging pocket-books where
we find our flagrant ta dodgers.
Many of these people by one dishon- 4 i
2S^ JILsSS&^^&SSsF Jlsui^iirt^--
est devise or another evade every tax
that they safely can. It is this class
of citizens that make the burden of
taxation harder than it should be for
honest taxpayers because all taxes
which by trickery and dishonest
methods tax dodgers get out of pay
ing must be made up by the less fa
vored and more honest taxpayers of
the county.
"The tax commission will aid as
sessors- by every means in its power
to enforce the law against this class
of citizens and when a false state
ment by a taxpayer is called to our
attention we will see that the matter
is placed in the hands of the county
attorney for prosecution. Much can
be done by assessors to prevent tax
dodging if they will perform their
duties fearlessly and diligently and in
strict accordance with law.
"If honest taxpayers could only be
brought to realize that the only way
their rights can be safeguarded and
a square deal for everybody obtained
is by a full listing and legal assess
ment of all property in their district,
tax dodging instead of being regard
ed as a harmless game of wits in
which the strong, the resourceful, and
the greedy nearly always win would
be regared as a crime and dealt with
accordinglv. If good citizens fully un
derstood that tax dodging in nine
cases out of ten simply meant that
well to do citizens were casting their
tax burdens upon their less favored
brethren tax dodging would become
odious and a tax dodger, if discovered
would become an object of contempt
in every community.
"Taxes have become so high in
many communities that they are a
great burden to citizens of moderate
mea.ns. There has been a noticeable
tendency in recent vears toward very
large public expenditures, and it be
hooves every good citizen and every
taxpayer of moderate means in such
communities to scrutinize all public
expenditures closely and to think
twice before lending their support to
any new public enterpriseno matter
how attractive it may seem. The
thing to be considered by people of
moderate means in such communities
is not so much whether a proposed
new building or improvement is a
good thing in itself or not but rather
one of whether they can reallv afford
to hve anything added to their al
ready heavy burdens."

HOUSE NOT YET LET.
The school board opened the bids
for the new school house last Thurs
day. A large number of bidders were
on hand, but the bids submitted were
much higher than the architects esti
mate. The constantly increasing
prices on building material is respon
sible for the high bids None of the
bids were accepted that day, but the
board is still having them under con
sideration. With some modifications
in the plan, it is hoped that a satis
factory price may be arrived at, that
will be acceptable to the board.
John Kurz Visits Warren.
John Kurz, the well known pioneer
farmer west of town, arrived last
Saturday from Montana, where he
has spent most of the winter with a
married daughter. He says they
have had a hard winter in Montana,
with lots of snow, that has delayed
railroad traffic. Some farmers owing
to impassable roads have been com
pelled to burn grain for fuel, al
though lignite coal is found in the
hills but a few miles away.
Mr. Kurz brought the sad news of
his wife's death at Josephine, N. D.,
on Feb. 27th. She was one of the
sturdy pioneer women of Marshall
county and many friends here besides
members of the family mourn her de
parture.
Mr. Kurz visited with his brother,
P. J. Kurz, at Argyle on Monday,
and on the following day left again
for Montana. He expects to be back
here some time this spring.

County Officials Victims of a Joker.
Saturday a very queer looking per
sonage visited each officer in the
county court house and by his sus
picious movements had them all in a
state of excitement.
The stranger first called at^the of
fice of county auditor Lundgren and
tried to procure a fishing license, but
was informed that there was jio need
for such. He departed after cutting
.several capers that convinced* the
auditor that his caller was not exact
ly of a sound mind
Leaving the auditor's office he went
to the office of county treasurer
Bakke, where he wished to pay the
taxes of a farmer residing near Al
varado. He remained here long
enough to have the treasurer make
out the necessary receipt, when he
left to make a call on the other of
ficers.
After calling on C. E. Grinder, he
went to the office of clerk of court
Swandby and asked for a marriage
license as he wanted to marry onp
Tillie Johnson, who was supposed to
have been employed on the Snake
River Farm. Mr Swandbv, how
ever, became a little suspicious about
the actions of the man and decided
he would make sure before issuing
the license. He called the sheriff,
who in turn took the supposed to be
nut to his office. After several
questions asked by the sheriff he
was again taken down to the lobby,
where he came to his right senses
and proved to be none other then A.
T, Rustad, of Minneapolis, a well
known and popular traveling sales
man.
