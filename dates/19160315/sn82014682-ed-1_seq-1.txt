Honolulu will, bate a' public golf

proposal of Cue VJIawaii Promotion
Committee is pSw-jd on favorably by
the Chamber of Commerce.' j --
The members believe that with a 9
hole course at Kapiolanl ; - rarn
Honolulu aill receive many itourista
who will have an opportunity to play
their favorite game near the Jeach
and close to the big hotels in that
vicinity. With the Oahu Country Club
at one end of the city and a public
golf links at the other end. Honolulu
would be well supplied with golfv ; , ,
' . According to the members there are
hundreds of visitors to the city who
enjoy, the game, and most 'of these
are men of. wealth who remain tere
for some time. The golf players are
boosters In every respect, and the pro
posal was made that the opportunity
for. the establishment of a course ia
now and the matter will be taken up
with the Chamber of -Commerce. 1: k
Upon the return from the trip to
Hawaii, George Angus, a member' of
the committee, took op the project of
establishing a golf , course below the
Volcano House on Hawaii. Id r. Angus
is a member of the greens committee
of the Oahu Country Club and is. fami
liar with the golf situation, p.'? J '
. te stated that should a 9 or 18 hole
course be laid out below the Volcano
House many tourists would re
main at KUauea for an indefinite pe
riod, as there am many, golfers who
like nothing better . than to "play the
game the year round. , Members of
the Promotion Committee looked over
the ground during their stay on the
Big Island and all were satisfied hat
a links could be planned In that vic
inity. It is expected that the prelimin
ary plans for the establishment of a
