of the tax laws, part icula'. 1> of the
special laws passed hy tits tax-"efortn

attributed the wide measure of suc

the new system of partial segregation,

under taxation property that had in
the past escaped assessment

WASHINGTON. March H?While
there were Indications in official 11!.s
patches from Mexico to-day that the
de facto Government was makiitc a
supreme effort to capture Villa and
his bandits with lis own forces, there
was no siKtt Hint General Pun.stoit'K
orders to proceed on the same errand
had boon modified in any way.
Word that American troops had
crossed the border was still lacking,
tlie War Department itself not having:
been advised a.s to when the movement
would hesln.
Congress took active notice of the
border situation to-day for the first
time. The House passer! a joint reso
lution late in the day authorizing the
recruiting of the mobile regular army
to full strength This means the addi
tion of approximately -jn.orto lighting
men to the infantry, cavalry and tie hi
ariillcry. The Senate is expected to
concur to-morrow, and the necessary
orders will be issued immediately to
till up regiments on border duty
sTi:r is st;ta;i-:sTr.r>

The step was suggested by the army
general staff. Kver since the patrol
of the border began the army has been
greatly handicapped by the skeleton
organizution of regiments, companies.
troor>s and batteries. The force that
occupied Vera Cruz had similar diffi
culties. some of the companies th"ie
being less than forty men strong.
Secretary Raker conferred to-day
with Senator Chamberlain and H< pre
sentative Hay. chairmen of tlie con
gressional Military Committees. The
resolution was introduced by It c pre
ventative 11 it >- iinmediatel\ upon his
return to the Capitol Its consideration
wa? expedited b\ unanimous consent
and its passage followed, with repre
sentative London, Socialist. voting?
against it.
The State Depart men t has forwarded
bv cable, telegraph, radio and mail full
statements of all that has transpired
since the raid upon Columbus and of
the attitude of the t'nited States gov
ernment and its : ecriproca 1 agreement
with the Oarranza government to con

throughout the southern republic. It
is expected these officials will cuirct
