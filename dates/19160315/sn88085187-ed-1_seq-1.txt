Remarkable Picture Showing Exact Scene of Mexican Bandits' Attack, Skirmish and Flight
THIS UNUSUAL PHOTOGRAPH SHOWS THE EXACT SCENE OK THE VILLA
BANDIT ATTACK.
HERE IS SEEN THE CAMP OF THE THIRTEENTH REGIMENT OF 0. S. TROOP
ERS, JUST OUTBID! THE VILLAGE OF COLUMBUS, N M., WHICH IS ALSO IMC-
A Word About
Preparedness
As the first newspaper in Tacoma to preach pre
paredness, The Times is convinced, today, that the
nation even yet is only half awake to the danger
which confronts it.
It has been a week now since the bandit Villa
raided an American city, killed American citizens in
his mad luat for blood, and got clean away, IN
SPITE OF THE FACT THAT THE CITY WAS
SUPPOSEDLY GUARDED BY AMERICAN SOL
DIERS.
Although we've made a lot of talk about what
we're going to do to Villa when we catch him, OUR
ARMY IS BTILL GETTING READY. From El
Paso ctimes word that many troops ordered to the
border from inland points have not vet arrived. No
ears were available, it seems, in which to transport
them.
A lot of peanut congressmen, arc complicating
matter fui'ther hy yowling around, back in Washing
ton, about the way President Wilson is handling the
affair. And all this, mind you, is not a war, but just
a little bandit-hunt.
What would happen if the United States, to pre
serve its honor, should have to go to grips with a first
class world power? If one savage, unwashed Indian,
a fugitive from the law even in his own country, can
turn the United States topsy-turvy like this, what
under the sun would we do if we were called upon to
make war against Germany, or Japan, or England?
The Times has published preparedness warnings
since the very beginning of the struggle in Europe.
]t has published articles by the foremost experts in
the country. It believes in the efficacy of the Swiss
military pian of compulsory TRAINING for the na
tion's youth. Today it publishes another article by
Charles Edward Russell on this particular subject
■which you are urged to read. Hussell has studied the
Swiss and other army military systems at first hand
in Europe, where he went expressly for The Times
and its sister papers. He knows what he is talking
about. His article appears on page 8.
The Times believes the paramount duty of this
session of congress is to settle down, stop its petty
quibbling, AND GIVE THE NATION SOME ADE
QUATE MEANS OF DEFENDING ITSELF.

ACCUSED
OFFICER
Failing, he said, to find suffic

Prosecutor Remann yesterday
dropped tho case against Theo
dore Hopkins, former patrolman.
Hopkins was charged with im
proper attentions to several small
girls living near his beat. Fol
lowing hot protests from many
parts of the city he was arrested
and later discharged from tho po
lice force.
Members of the prosecuting at
torney's office said they did not
have convincing evidence against
Hopkins. They claim it would
have been impossible to convict
him.
Others, however, were of the
opinion that the case was allowed
to slide until it was forgotten and
then dropped.

Under the noses of police officers, free-for all gambling games are run
ning wide open today in the heart of Tacoma.
In back rooms "private offices" of at least five downtown cigar stores,
old-time gamers are plying their trade, getting their rake-offs from the pock
etbooks of Tacoma wage earners.
Poker, pangingue and other games are running full blast and are drawing
big crowds.
Anybody, from mere boys to white-haired men can get in and stake their
earnings. All they have to do is open the door and -sit down.
One of these places, behind the A. & B. Smoke House, 112.1 Pacific ay.,
was visited by a Times reporter yesterday. The Smoke House is run by Alfred
& Barton.
From the street it looked just
the same as any other cigar store.
An entrance directly back of
the counter where cigars and to
bacco were for sale led into n
large room, filled to the brim
with tables, poker chips and men.
The chips tinkled and the men
talked. But no money was In
sight. Evidently the»e men
merely were enjoying innocent
poker games, with red and white
disks as their wiiinlugß.
It was a blind. For at the far
end of the room was another
door, hung with I heavy curtain.
HtraUNH lla* Money tin;.'.
Evidently anyone who knew
about the door and what was be
hind It could enter If he wanted.
It led Into a small, well-ligiit
ed room. In the center was a Mi
circular table, with a litter ol
cards and chips. Around it at ■'■
o'clock yesterday sat seven men,
while others lounged about the
room watching the game.
Panglngue was being played.
At tlie center of opera
tions sat l_evi Strauss, old
time gambler, lie held the
mnoey tuns, a small leather
affair which lie laid on the
table and carefully opened at
intervals whenever anyone
"went broke" and boiiKht

He was togged out In

stranger entered Strauss threw
his cards on the table and drop
ped out of the game.
"Curli'V," he said, lo one of
the lookers-on, if yon want to
play, I'll stake you." So Curb y
was staked to a dollar's worth of
chips and got in.
In a Bluets or so more Bruce
and Cap Lawrence also dropped
out of the game.
Strauss then turned his atten
tion to one of the \oung fellows
who was new at the game, giving
him tips on how to pla;, his
hand.
Once the newcomer made %
misplay which cost hint a couple
of dollars.
