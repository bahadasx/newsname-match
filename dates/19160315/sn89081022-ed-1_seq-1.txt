O I A
CHRISTOPFER E. QUALE.
One of the very early settlers of
Kerkhoven Township died on Monday
of last week, when Mr. C. E. Quale
passed away. Mr. Quale was a leader
in his sphere of influence and was
one of the best known citizens of his
township while he never aspired for
position, nevertheless" his influence
was felt for the better things in civic
life.
Christoffer Erickson Quale was
born at Quale, Vang, Valdris, Nor
way, Jan. 17, 1843. He came to Am
erica in 1864 locating first in Good
hue county but later joining the very
vanguard of the early settlers on the
western frontier of Minnesota in 1866.
He pre-empted land in Swift county,
in the Township of Kerkhoven, where
he lived the full measure of fifty
years.
He was married1 while in Norway
to Miss Ingeborg Hamre, with whom
he had nine sons and two daughters,
of which children six survive their
father. They are, Erick Quale, of
Hartford, S. D. Tosten Quale of Will
mar Jacob Quale, who resides on a
farm adjoining the home place in
Township of Kerkhoven Dr. Carle
Quale of Chicago John C. Quale of
Minneapolis and Miss Bertha Quale
on the home farm. All were at home
for the funeral. The wife and mother
died in 1909.
The funeral occurred Friday after
noon at the West Norway Lake
church, Rev. M. Sotendahl officiating.
In spite of breaking-up roads, the
church was filled with sympathizing
friends.
HALVOR MITTVEDT.
Halvor Mittvedt died at his home in
this city last Sunday, at the age of
72 years. Death was caused by heart
failure. Deceased had been ailing for
the last two years.
Halvor Mittvedt was born January
8, 1842, at Telemarken, Norway, Vinje
parish. His youth was spent in Nor
way. In 1873 he was united in mar
riage with Miss Joraand Udgaarden.
On June 12, 1887 he came to this
country, settling in Dakota county,
Minnesota, where he remained for
seven years. In 1884 the family re
moved to a farm three miles south
east of Willmar, where they resided
until ten years ago. At that time
they moved to this city, and here de
ceased resided until his death. He is
survived by his wife and the follow
ing children: Sara, Tillie, Mrs. W. T.
Swenson of Excelsior, Minn. Olaf of
Lakeville, Minn. Anna, Johanna and
Agnes of this city. All were present
at the funeral.
Funeral services were held this.
(Wednesday) afternoon, from the
house at one-thirty o'clock and from
the church at two o'clock, Rev. J. N.
Andersen1 officiating.^.
The pall bearers were O. A. Gran
gaard, Andrew Hildahl, M. O. Thorpe,
L. O. Thorpe, T. Kiland and O. A.
Norman.
The sympathy of the entire com
munity is extended to the grief-strick
en family in their hour of sorrow.
ALBERT E. CHRISTIANSON.
Albert E. Christianson died last
Tuesday, March 7, at the home of
Mrs. Sophia Framstad in Norway
Lake, where he had been employed
as farm hand. The cause of death
was typhoid fever.
Mr. Christianson was born August
10, 1887, and had thus attained the
age of twenty-eight years, six months
and twenty-seven days.
Interment was made in the West
Norway Lake cemetery, Rev. Soten
dahl officiating. The pall bearers were
Carl Ellingboe, Bernt Hanson, Julius
Hanson, William Lien, Elmer Lien
and Henry Lien,
First M. E. Church.
At the First Methodist church next
Sunday evening, March 19th, the pas
tor, Rev. Wm. A. Rice, will give an
address on "The Causes of the Euro
pean War." He will use a map to as
sist in explaining the complicated cir
cumstances that have brought on the
present conflict.
Many people have wondered what
it was all about. More have wonder
ed whether the United States may it
self be drawn into the trouble, or if
not the present strife, whether the
same conditions that have broughtJif
teen nations into strife shows the
possibility of our government some
day being forced to defend itself. This
is a time when every American citi
zen should inform himself on the his
torical significance of events that
have long since passed by, yet they
are having their influence on the
present strife.
