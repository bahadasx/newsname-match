Plenty Of Corn.
The government estimato of
the amount of corn held by Okla
home farmers ,op March 1, 1910,
is UT.'JOU.UOO bushels 113 compared
with lO.OOU.U'JO bush Is one year
ago and 0,105.0(,'U two years ngo.
In the United Stats the esti
mate for March 1. this year is
l.MO.OOO.OOO bushels compared
with 'UU.Sflo.OOO one year ngo.
The price in Oklahoma is giv
en as fill centH and H3 cents one
year ugo. -In the United States
03.2 cents this year and 75.1
cents one year ago.
From these figures it can be
seen that there will bu no trou
ble to buy corn in Oklahoma this
summer and those who have to
buy can get it at a figure where
they can afford to buy it.

day or two later the man came to
Elgin and priced windows, find
ing that bo could got them .'10
cents cheaper for tho same win
dows than wn paid for tho five
in the city.
What did he do? Well he
bought ire windows in Elgin,
took them home with him and re
turned the five to the city, thus
saving $1.50 in the deal. Thin is
