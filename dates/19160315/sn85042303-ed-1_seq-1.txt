- CENSORED REPORTS FROM COLUMBUS, NEW MEXICO,
TODAY DO MOT MENTION TROOP MOVEMENTS
THERE.
It is Known, However, that Some of the Troops with Camps
Broken are Under Marching Equipment in at Least Two
Positions on the Border General Belief Along Border is
that Troops Will Have Crossed Irto Mexico by Tonight-
Point of Entrance Said to be oi rge of Desolate Plain,
Across Thirty Miles of which A 'ican Soldiers Must
March to Reach Lowest Ranee of a Madre Mountains.
No Roads of Any Kind, and Troop. 'ist Carry AH their
Provisions and Rely on Base for W ' cr Mexican Com
mander at Juarez Says, No America'roops Have Yet
Crossed Line. Awaitina Permission frc' len. Carranza.
)' El Paso, Tex., March
Reports that the American mili-
1 tary force at Columbus, N. M.,
had broken camp, could not be
confirmed today. Messages
came from Columbus through
the censor, but they did not
mention troop movements.
It was known, however, that
some of the troops with their
camps broken, were under
marching equipment along the
border in at least two positions.
General Gavira, the Juarez
' commandant, said today that
he had received information
that the American troops have
not yet crossed the border and
that they are awaiting Carran
za's permission before so doing.
The border awoke today to the con
viction that before another day the
United Status troops would have gone
into Mexico at Columbus to capture
Villa. The point chosen for entrance
is on the verge of a desolate plain, in
habited only by prairie dogs and coy-
otes. For thirty miles the soldiers
must make their way across this des
ert, then they reach the lowest range
of the Sierra Madre mountains. There
are no roads of any kind in that re
gion. The expeditionary force must
carry all of its provisions and rely on
a base for its water supply.
Carry All on Backs.
Columbus, N. M., March 13. The
commanding officers of the expedition
ary force issued orders last night that
the men should take with them only
such equipment as they could carry
J on their hacks or saddles. Extra
clothing and the equipment known in
the army as the "surplus kit" will be
left behind.
These orders wore intended to limit
carrying facilities to the essentials of
the expedition food and drink for the
men and horses, and ammunition for
the guns.
Large quantities of ammunition for
the mountain howitzers and field guns
which had been assembled here, were
distributed yesterday.
"Combat wagons," which carry am
munition for the soldiers' rifles, were
loaded and the engineers, signal and
hospital corps were supplied with tho
final details of their equipment.
The commander of the expedition
and his staff worked at high pressure
all day completing their arrangements.
Such of the soldiers who were not
unloading the transport trains, which
moved in and out of the railroad yards
hourly, thronged every eminence or
bit of high ground watching eagerly
for any sign of activity on the other
side of the international line. Many

EIGHT OR NINE BATTLE CRUIS
ERS ARE NOW LACKING IN THE
AMERICAN FLEET, SAYS CAP
TAIN OF THE NEVADA.
Washington, March U. Immediate
construction of eight or nine battle
cruisers to provide an element of
strength now sadly lacking in the
American fleet, was urged before the
house naval committee Tuesday by
Captain Sims, commanding the battle
ship Nevada.
The captain also advised the build
ing of many additional destroyers.
He said that while much had been
accomplished toward making arm il-ed
ships less vulnerable to torpedoes,
there had been no solution of the
problem of protecting a fleet against
torpedo attack in open sea. There
fore, he said, the navy should have
plenty of fast craft to chase off de
stroyers and submarine enemies.
Much information was given the
committee by the witness concerning
the navies of the world and their
operations. He said it was improbable
that any great expedition against tho
United Stales ever would start f-om
the other side of the Atlantic but
that some point in the West Indies
probably would be used as a hu e.
He strongly indorsed the navy de
part ment's proposal to promote of
fleers by selection instead of hy sen
iority. "The navy is a Foft snap to trios;'
who are not ambitious," he said, "but
deadly to the ambitious ones; as a
military proposition this age eitua
tion is rotten; from a social stand
point it is excellent, and as a soft
snap, it's a peach."
Before the committee began its
hearing Tuesday Chairman Padgett
conferred with President Wilson, who
urged him to speed up work on
the naval appropriation bill. The
chairman said he expected the hear
ings to be concluded within two
weeks.
Representative Padgett assured the
president that a wording majority of
his committee favored substantial
strengthening of the navy and that he
expected no trouble in getting
through the house a naval program
to meet with the approval of the
administration.

Washington, March 13. The state

from Torreon. No instructions to

AS MANY FORTUNES WILL
MADE IN ARDMORE AS HAVE
BEEN MADE IN THE HEALDTON
FIELD.
There will be as many fortunes
made in Ardmore real estate within
the next five years as there have
been made in tho Healdton oil fields.
A deal was made yesterday which
confirms this prophecy.
The B. M. Bynum single-story brick
building located on the south side of
West Main street and occtipied iy
Hal M. Cannon, C. G. Squires and Mr.
Varnell, sold through Roy Shores to
Harold Wallace for $16,000, and be
fore the papers were signed Mr. Wal
lace had been offered a profit of
$4,000 for his bargain. It has not
been but a short time since i',000
was considered a high price for prop
erty in that district, and now the
price has been doubled, and 'f Mr.
(Wallace chose to accept the profit
offered him the price would almost be
trebled. When one day's work brings
a profit in clear cash of $1,000, the
people will become interested and
men who have made fortunes in other
cities will be coming here to share
In the prosperity of the city.
A well known oil man recently eta
ted that he would rather risk Ard
more property for profits than oil
lands, and he has made Investments
here running into several thousand
dollars. The time has come for profit
making in city realty. The time has
come for larger and better buildings.
Men of means are not fearful of mak
ing investments here. The people are
not afraid to improve property, and
$."i0,000 is as freely invested in con
struction work as $."..000 was Invested
a few years ago. These are condi
tions that build a city, and these are
conditions here now.

NINE INDIVIDUALS INTO CUSTO-'
DY SAID TO HAVE BEEN VIOLAT
ING THE LAWS OF THE STATE.
Sheriff Garrett and his minions last
night paid another unexpected visit to
Ragtown In the oil fields and took nine
individuals into custody which were
alleged to be engaged In violating the
liquor and gambling laws of the state.
The nine were brought to this city
and are now in the county jail where
they will be he'd pending their ar
raignment. Yesterday four were taken
before the county judge for this same
offense from the same place, and If
present speed is maintained, it is evi
dent that Ragtown will have to Im
port another set of pports to cater to
the taste of the drillers whom It Is al
leged cannot get along without booze
or a gambling joint. The best class of
oil field creators, however, deny this
charge and do everything In their
power to assiot the officers in cleaning
out the dives said to exist In the oil
field metropolis.

proportions nro under way.
In the sector between Iiethlncourt
and Cuniieres, northwest of Verdun,
the intense artillery bombardment of
the Germans was followed by an in

by the French with serious losses, ex

The Germans three times north of
