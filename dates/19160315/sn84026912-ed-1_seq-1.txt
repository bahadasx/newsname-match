TREATY 500 YEARS ODD.
Portugal Stands by Her Treaty Obli
gations io tho totter.
Washington, March 13.-Portugal
entered tho war, the Portuguese le
gation announced to-day, because
Groat Britain requested her to do so,
in fulfillment of treaty obligations
dating back to 1373. Portugal did
not enter the war before, the Portu
guese .minister announced, because
Great Britain had not. called on her
to do so.
' A statement outlining Portugal's
I position, Issued by Viscount de Alte,
the Portuguese minister, said:
"Portugal is drawn into the war as
a result of her long standing alliance
with longland, an alliance that bas
withstood unbroken tho strain of .">00
years.
"biko Belgium, Portugal desires
nothing that belongs to any other na
tion; she has nothing to gain and
much to lose in the present conflict.
But she is ready, notwithstanding, to
aid longland to <t?he full extent of lier
resources--whether great or small
because tho treaties in force compel
her to do so and because her people
firmly believe that, international good
faith, as evidenced by the fulfillment
of treaty obligations, which rs the
principle Tor which Groat Britain is
lighting, provides tho only basis on
whlcih intercourse between civilized
nations can securely stand."
