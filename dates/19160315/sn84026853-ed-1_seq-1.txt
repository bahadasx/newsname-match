AMERICANS SLAIN I
? BY VILLA BANDITS
DOZEN OR MORE MEN AND I
WOMEN MURDERED BY
BANDITS.
Columbus, N. M., March 9.?Five
hundred Mexican bandits, believed to
have been led by Francisco Villa,'1
crossed the border under cover of '
darkness early today and attacked 1
this town, killing a dozen, or more s
A <v\n..inn?i mart onif momen lnrlllHirifr 1
nuicx icon illVii uuv* v<
at least six United States soldiers. I1
When the bandits fled toward Mex- j1
ico some hours later they were pur-J1
sued by United States troops, who:'
are said to have crossed the border, j1
A large number of Mexican dead '
were left lying in the streets of Col- '
umbus and at the border the Mexi- (
cans were subjected to a flank at- 1
tack by American troops and 18
more of their number killed. 1
Several American citizens in Col- 1
x umbus declared they personally saw 1
Villa directing his men and a port- 1
manteau found by a trooper con- ]
tained Villa's papers.
The attack was a surprise. Villa '<
"was supposed to have been 44 miles
away, having last night caused a tele- 1
gram to be sent indicating his pres- ]
ence at a Nogales ranch.
Four men, citizens of Columbus, >
and two women, are known to have i
been killed. , Three other men and 1
a woman are listed among the dead. I
Prior to the attack the Villa ban- 1
-dits hanged three Americans whom <
thev had held as prisoners for some :
<lays, according to information re- I
ceived here. Their bodies were 1
N burned the report said.
The Villa men were said to have 1
"been joined by Carranza soldiers af- i
ter they crossed the border. A deep
-ditch parallels the United States '
army camp, the customs house and i
the railroad station. Through this
:gully the bandits approached unnoticed.
After posting snipers at advantageous
points the bandits set fire to (
buildings including the railway sta- ,
tions and hotels. As people rushed (
from ther homes they were shot j
down. i
Civilians armed themselves and together
with United States soldiers, ,
fought a battle of several hours with
the bandits.
Col. Slocum's revolver was shot
from his hand as he left his quarters.
Some of the bandits by speaking English
lured housefolk to the streets |
and then shot them. From burn- ing
hotels and other structures per- 1
' sons who sought to escape were killed ]
or wounded. 1
When dawn came the retreat of ;
the Villa men was under way. Villa
himself apparently had left earlier. ]

of Mexican dead. Many Mexican 1
wounded were removed to the post 1
hospital. ]
Information that Francisco Villa
and his chief lieutenant, Pablo Lopez, :
_ were in personal command was given
Col. Slocum by a Mexican rancher '
who escaped during the fighting. He
told of the hanging of the Americans '
ranchers McKinney, Corbett and J
O'Neil, and declared that a fourth 1
American whose name he did not .
know, had also been hanged. 1
The Mexican said Villa attacked 1
with from 800 to 1,000 men, and a 1
machine gun platoon. '
The Mexican told Col. Slocum that .
Villa left the Bosques Grandes ranch J
Tuesday, made a leisurely journey
north and about 4 o'clock yesterday 1
left a point on the Boca Grande and *
started for the border. .
"Traveling north they crossed the
boundary west of Columbus," said i J
the Mexican and entered town by a j
ditch running past the cavalry camp.
Villa was in personal charge and de- '
dared he was going to kill every j
American because the American gov-lj
-eminent did not treat him right. Vil-1
la said Carranza could not bring;'
peace in Mexico. With Villa were |
Pablo Lopez, Martin Lopez, Col. ]

The Mexican confirmed a report
that before leaving the Santa Ana
district in western Chihuahua, Villa
had freely stated that he intended to
' force intervention by raiding American
territory and killing civilians and
soldiers.
Lieut. Clyde Ely, with twenty men 1
of the new Mexican national guard,
arrived from Deming today and joined
the Feedral troops.
Capture Them Dead or Alive is
' Command.
Washington, March 10.?President'
Wilson today ordered American
1 troops over the Mexican border to ,
capture or kill the Villa bandits who i
yesterday raided Columbus, N. M. j
Major General Scott, chief of staff \
l of the army, announced that the ex- j
pedition would consist of not less ?
than 5,000 men all of which are ]
available on the border under Major ,
General Funston. ]
It was decided at today's cabinet
meeting that Villa and his bandits ]
> must be caught. A statement is i
^ being prepared at the White House 1
and will be issued later today. j
In its present stage, the president's
order does not mean armed inter- i
mention in Mexico. It provides for i

GOVERNOR'S RACE
MAKES ANNOUNCEMENT AFTER
CONFERENCE WITH FRIENDS
IN GREENWOOD.
Greenwood, March 8.?Special:
rhe Hon. Robert A. Cooper, of Laurens,
announced here to-night that1

nor in the Democratic primary this j
summer. Mr. Cooper's announce-;
ment was made after a conference
with friends from many sections of j
the State, who had come to Green-1
itfood for the purpose of considering
bis duty in the coming campaign. Mr i
Cooper has been here all the week
attending court as solicitor for thisl
circuit, and Greenwood is easily accessible,
hence its selection as a
meeting place for his friends.
In making the announcement Mr. I
Cooper stated that his platform j
would be given in due time. Those 1
close to Mr Cooper say that he makes
the announcement now so that his
position will be known. He has
been urged, it is claimed, by men in
all sections of the State for the past
six months to offer as a candidate for
Governor this summer. Although
missing the nomination for Governor
two years ago by a very close margin,
around two hundred vot6s, it was
not Mr. Cooper's intention to thrust
himself into the political situation in
South Carolina this year. He at
first declined all suggestions to this
effect, but it is said that the requests
for him to offer as a candidate have
become so frequent and so insistent
that he feels it a duty to yield to the
judgment of his friends in this matter.
? It is stated that he has never
sought public office on anything other

When asked to-night if he had any
comment to make on the announcement
of Mr. R. A. Cooper, for Gov-j
srnor, former governor, Cole L.
Blease said: "The more the merrier.
The water is fine, come on in."
Mr. Blease some days ago announced
his candidacy for Governor.
NO ALARM, SAYS McLAURIN
Columbia, March 8.?Special: A
telegram received to-day from John
L. McLaurin, State warehouse com-,
missioner, who is on his way home1
from New York, stated that there
need be no alarm over the fire insurance
situation in this State. Mr.
McLaurin's dispatch also said that
there would be no difficulty in placing
insurance in safe companies either
in New York or London. Commissioner
McLaurin is expected to
reach Columbia early in the morning.
sa government has no control.
The following statement was issued
it the White House:
"An adequate force will be sent at
jnce in pursuit of Villa with the single
object of capturing him and putting
a stop to his forays.
"This can be done and will be done
in entirely friendly aid of the constituted
authorities in Mexico and
svith scrupulous respect for the sovereignty
of that republic."
It was explained at the White
House that the American government
ivants Villa dead or alive and that
no steps will be neglected to carry
jut that object.
It was declared, however, that the
United States will not consider the
expedition as an invasion of Mexico
and will continue to deal with the
Carranza government. The American
government is still opposed to
armed intervention, but has decided,
that the peace of Mexico and the j
United States is imperilled by the
continued activities of Villa. I
The cabinet was unanimous in deciding
that Villa must be caught.
Secretary Baker left the White
House to confer with Major General
Hugh L. Scott, chief of staff, and
ornow nfflnofo fn rla incf Vinixr

nany troops would be needed to folow
Villa.
It was said that the pursuit of Villa
will be undertaken in a compre-|
iiensive way and organized plans will
ae laid for his capture.
Officials received the word with
mdisguised satisfaction. Cabinet
members expressed themselves as
greatly pleased. Army officers voiced
unanimous approval. A general j
feeling of relief that the administration
had finally decided to take the
step was apparent.
The president himself is firmly con-!
winced of the necessity of eliminating
Villa from the Mexican situation.:
He is represented as just as determined
to get rid of Villa as he was
co oust Huerta.
The announcement of the intention
of the president to send troops
into Mexico was accompanied by
scenes not equalled at the White
House since the determination to
send the Atlantic fleet to Vera Cruz
in 1914.
Pains were taken by officials to
point out their hope that Gen. Car-1
ranza, wouia realize trie spirit in
which the American troops were being
sent after Villa.
Carranza will be notified immedi-!
itely that the United States has no
intention of taking any Mexican ter- i
ritory whatever and respects fully
the sovereignty of that nation.

CAM TO AID I
IN VILLA PURSUIT
STATEMENT SAYS EVERY STEP 1
IS BEING TAKEN TO PRECLUDE
INTERVENTION.
Washington, March 13.?The United
States Government entered into i
a formal agreement with the de facto ;
Government of Mexico to-day under ?
which American troops will cross the 1
border to hunt down Villa and his '
bandits with the expectation of hear- 1
ty co-operation from the Carranza (
forces. i
Secretary Lansing made public the (
text of a note accepting Gen. Car- t
ranza's proposal for a reciprocal ar- '
rangement between the two Govern1
ments and announcing that the Unit- ^
ed States held this arrangement to
be?now in force and binding upon :
both parties. Gen. Funston will carry
out his task under this agreement.
Official announcement was awaited
to-night that the American force had
crossed the border. Plans for the
troop movements have gone ahead
without regard to the diplomatic exchanges.
Mr. Lansing also made public a
statement issued in the name of President
Wilson reiterating that every
step being taken by the Administra
tion was based on the deliberate intention
to preclude the possibility of
armed intervention in Mexico.
Preparedness Measures Rushed to
Forefront.
Washington, March 13.?Danger
of grave complications growing out
of the sending of American troops into
Mexico to hunt down Villa and
his bandits was urged in the Senate
to-day by Senator Chamberlain,
chairman of the military committee,
and Senator Borah, Republican, in
advocating laying aside temporarily
all other legislation in order to dispose
promptly of preparedness measures.
Their statements precipitated
a general discussion, in which Senators
Vardaman and Simons depre-*
cated suggestions that the United
States was not prepared to deal with
any situation that might arise in its
I relations with Mexico, while Senator
Hoke Smith urged that the military
I committee should bring in immediately
a bill to double the enlisted
strength of the army as an emergency
measure, leaving the general reorganization
bill to more mature consideration.
