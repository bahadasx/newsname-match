TOO N9ISY ABfll'T IT.
]l seems to ho ccttinc so that
everybody can t• iI when r-ontra
band or outlawed whisky come.'- to
town. Another example of it oc
curd 1-ist Saturday evening when
loud lalkine and swearing took
place within a short ditance of
The Press office. This tinio, it
appears, a knife was brought into
requisition to make the occasion
more emphatic- than it was before.
The Press does not believe that
it is at all necessary foi it publih
the names of persons who ciir:iie
in such street brawls: it oujrht not
to be necessary, in order to iive
the liquor traffic the denunciation
that it deserves. Every time such
events happen here the question
comes up whether it was bootlec
injj, or not. Jf the liquor is brot
here bv a bootlegger, then the
man who swears and gets drunk in
public places is three times a law
breaker.
Such being the case, the liquor
traffic should be made to stand on
its own feel, and lie denied the aid
and comfort of a license fee, or U.
internal revenue tax.

The Press is under obligations
to Congressman Royal Johnson
for the daily receipt of the Con
gressional Record, and also, indi
rectly, to Congressman Chas. II.
H. Randall the prohibition party
member from Los Angeles-Cal.
It is a veritable encyclopedia of
American up-to-the-minute poli
tics.
After a brief correspondence
with South Dakota's delegation in
Congress, it is a pleasure to The
Press to learn that at least two of
the delegation, namely, Represen
tatives Royal C. Johnson and (."has.
II. Dillon, are in favor of a per
manent tariff commission. The
tariff question—like the licensc
question—has been threshed over
by American voters for so long,
without either side being willing
to "giye up," that we think now
it is time for the "rag" to be
thrown to the '"goats" to chew,
while we have some politics to do
connectd with the world's ad
vanced thought.
After the fellows who are hol
lering so for "preparedness*1 get
thru talking, we hope those who
are for EFFICIENCY FIRST
will be allowed to have TIIE1R
say. The idea of a big army hav
ing to fight with shotless shells
and the commissary wagons sup
plied with petrified or stale corned
beef
"Remember the Maine!"

Capt. Olson and Forest Oates
came across from the Agency
Monday with the steel rowboat,
after cutting thru the narrow neck
of ice that remained opposite Tom
Cay wood's residence. This had
the eCkvt, a few hours later, of
loosening up a large block of ice
which floated down about a quar
ter of a mile and then lodged
again. The result of it all was to
give us open water for rowing
clear across the 'creek' from the
Press office up to the telephone
line, a distance of nearly a quarter
of a mile.
