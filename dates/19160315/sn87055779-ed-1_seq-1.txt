The governor icfused absolutely

are Thomas Taggart. Evan H. Stot

In republican ranks, the news of
the death of Shively fell with a po
litical thud. The vacancy in the sen
ate will muddle republican waters;
immediately. The Watson forces de-!
dare they will go ahead with their,
intended tight to put Watson across;
as the nominee of the partv acainst1
John W. Kern, for the long term in
the senate. There are rumors of
wholesale frameups and deals by
which Watson would be given the
nomination for the short term and
thus allay the tight.
Put from the ranks of the New
supporters it is being pointed out
that while Xew's plurality over Wat
son was not large, there can be no
juestion that the majority of the
party repudiated the Watson can
didaey at the polls. Thereon will
the New forces bend their energies
ncainst Watson's name appearing on
the republican ticket in any posi
tion. Meanwhile comes the story, said
! to be absolutely authentic, that State
Chairman Will II. Hays of Sullivan,
has been promised the nomination to
make the jace acainst the Ralston
appointee f.r the tilling of the
Shively vacancy.

A half holiday was ordered in the

the matters relating to the pursuit

An oifuial of the :i I'aso and

"I am not allowed to talk about

Advices that Gen. Pershing's
troops had crossed the line and that
the pursuit of Gen. Francisco Villa
had begun were received from sev
eral different points. Practically all
agreed that the advance had begun
before dawn. A telephone message
from Columbus that reached El Paso
at 2:H0 a. m. said that the American
forces had broken camp. The send
er of this message said that he was
unable to give any further informa
tion, owing to the censorship.
Reports of the advance were gen
erally accepted here as correct. MnJ.
Gen. Funston had given Gen. Persh
ing authority to move when ready.
It was pointed out here that a start
made in the early morning would
give the cavalry screen sent In ad
vance of the infantry and artillery
an opportunity to strike well into
the hills south of the border before
sunrise.
Official announcement of the be
ginning of the march Into the south

eral days, or until the government
censor felt news could be given out.
Correspondents selected to accom
pany the troops left El Paso yester
day afternoon for Columbus, but
they wer not permitted to send
any message from there.
The 'first aero squadron .of the
army, commanded by Capt. Penjamin
I). Fouliers, reached Columbus last
night. The machines for the Amer
ican aviators are now being set up
at (Jen. Pershing's base, but they
probably will not make their first
reconnaissance until Friday.
Information from the invading
column will be transmitted to the
border by couriers and by wireless.
The wreless outfit is under command
of Sergt. A. P. Malloy.
The exciting rumors as to possible
resistance by Carranza forces gave
El Paso many thrills during file
early morning. All streets in the
city wer patrolled by guards armed
with rifles and revolvers. The guar Is
were particularly numerous In the
Mexican quarter.
Carrania. oihcials in El Tao and
Juarez declared that the constitu

with the Americans, but declined t
state how this cooperation would be
effected. Andreas Garcia, the Car
ranza consul in El Paso, announced
that the troops under Gen. Pertani
had been withdrawn from Pas Pa
lomas. opposite Columbus, Iat night,
but would give no reason for this
action, whether voluntary or takn
at the request of Gen. Pershing.

The arrival of Obregon in Juarez
will bring the Carranzistas campaign
into immediate action. If Villa
lrites any man more than another,
that man is Obregon. It was Obre
gon who beat Villa at Celaya. Obre
gon is the big man in the Carranza
government. Obregon would take
a keen personal satisfaction in cap
turing Villa and personal satisfac
tions are a great factor In the war
fare of Mexico. There is small doubt
that his immediate order will be
that Villa be taken dead or alive
at once. The Carranza chiefs de
clare that their warriors can get
Villa In 10 days, but their clai.i.s
that they have Villa trapped, are re
ceived with some reservations here.
There are six Mexican generals In
the field against Villa. Rafael Mal

and Gutierrez. They cover an im
