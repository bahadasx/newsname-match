McGraw Followers Claiming Majority in
Chickasha While Harris Men are
Equally Confident of City
and County
BOTH SIDES SUPPORT
M. E. HUMPHREY
No Division of Sentiment on Sendintr
Chickasha Man to National Conven
tion; County Meeting Will Be
Held Next Saturday
The Republican conventions, held in
the different precincts of the county
yesterday evening to send delegates to
the county convention which will meet
in the city hall Saturday afternoon,
March IS, resulted in claims of victory
tor both McGraw and the Harris sup
porters.
The interests of all Republican poli
ticians of Grady county, like those of
heir brothers ovc:' 'he srqto at large.
for the t.!S seevral weeks have ro
voived about and centered in the can
(lidacy of Harris for re-election to the
tai.'onal committeemanship from
Ol.lahoma, or tho candidacy of his op
ponent, McGraw, who would suatcl
the committee tcga from the Harris'
tl.oulders.
Ihis morning both the Harris and
the -McGraw men were claiming Grady
county at large while both sides were
.nuking absolute claims that Chicka
ba had been carried 'by their candi-
ate. McGraw men claimed boastfully
that the result of the primaries by pre
diets gave McGraw a big lead over
the redoubtable Jim. The Harris men
while singing in a miuor key, also
Claimed Chickasha,
One of Harris' meat ardent support
ers stated eaily in the morning that
Chickasha had been carried beyond
the preadventure of a doubt. However,
another equally as strong Harris man
fcaid that he considered the city or
hukasha in doubt, but that the
forks of the creek" precincts would
come in with heavy enough vote for
Harris to put him over the home plate.
McGraw men are still claiming
ie city this afternoon and claim that
they will have enough lead out of
Chickasha to put Harris to sleep and
ive tho decision to the pet of the
new alliance "
Harris supporters stated this after-
oou that vhilo the city of Clncka-
ha might belong to McGraw, yet the
McGraw men were claiming the earth
and the fulness thereof without cause
cr reason. "They are claiming Mince,-'
th'U man said, "when we have
positive depe that Minco is in the Har
ris column by a heavy majority."
The concensus of opinion seems,
1-owever, that McGraw has teen in
the Chickasha fight beyond a doubt;
that his hat may have been kicked
about, but. never out of the ring; that
the result of the primary will show up
wilh McGraw at the bat on Saturday
afternoon; that "Big Jim" may beat
him at the show down, but that Mc
Craw's supporters are not giving up
licked until they are licked.
Latest advices on the matter, from
the Harris camp, state postively that
while the McGraw helmet may still bo
in the ring, in Grady county, the Har
ris delegates will be on hands at the
end of the gime and will be there iu
time to lead in all the shouting
The McGraw and the Harris men
seem to be unanimous in one opinion,
however, and that is that M. E. Hum
phrey will receive the unanimous vote
of the Grady county delegation, Mc
Graw and Harris men alike, for dele
gate to the P.epublican national con
vention. The following delegates were
chosen last evening to represent their
several precincts in Saturday's con
vention: Tom Dwyer, Olin Brashear,
J. V. Kayser G. B. Forrester Jr. E.
Humphrey, M. Smith, E. Hamilton,
J. A. Ros and Tom Burke.
The following were named as pre
cinct committeemen: J. J. Reeme, A.
Height, W. C. Matthews, J. A. Hamil

BIG BOOM
IN MINING
XPECTED
By United Press.
DENVER, Colo., March 13. V.ith
the opening of the spring season, Col
crado expect? to experience a big
boom iu mining. High prices in all
meta's and ores and the falling off
imports of minerals due to the Eu
ropean war is already showing its ef
fects In record activity among Colora
do's mining camps. The tugten
ields of Boulder county remind old
timers of the ear'y days :n Cripple
Creek and Leadville. Fortunes have
ec-n made in the tungsten fields and
the increased demand of this ore foi'
hardening tool3 promises continued
trtisperity. Zinc, which doubled its
output in the state last year, is keep-
g up its record production.
Good prices for silver has resulted
n a renewed interest in tne meiai.
Experts predict a big rise in the price
of silver at the clos of the wy, based
on the belligerents' need of silver
for a medium of exchange since Am-
Lor:ca is in possession or a large pari
the vorU'' gold supply. Gold pro-
uction continues to show remarkable
staying powers in Colorado. Rich
strikes on old properties are frequent
ly reported. Experts predict that the
aluo of Colorado's minerals miiied iu
S'lG will exceed that of any year in
.he state's history.
