.2KI ARMY WAITS WORD TO START
Reported That 1,500 Cavalrymea Have
Been on Villa's Trail for Two Days
—Outlaw Said to Be
Surrounded.
San Antonio, Tex., March 15.—Gen
eral Funston announced General Persh
ing had seized the telegraph station at
Columbus, N. M. Funston said: "The
seizure of the station was made neces-
ing out information about troop move
ments and concentrations, the number
of field pieces being assembled, aud
other facts regarding plana for the ex
pedition. The activity was proving
ruinous to our efforts."
Troops Ready to Start.
Funston declares he will give out no
more news until after the forces cross
the line. He said: "The start is so
close at hand that to keep telling about
the movement would have the effect of
keeping Villa informed."
It is believed only a matter of hours
until the troops enter Mexico.
Pershing's Plans Complete.
Columbus, N. M., March 15.—Gen.
John J. Pershing, at the bead of the
cavalry division which will start the
hunt for Francisco Villa, has completed
plans to cross the border today.
Troops in Mexico for Two Days?
Columbus, NVM., March 15.—Despite
the veil of censorship imposed on this
town by the American military authori
ties, news of feverish activity all along
the international boundary trickled
through. The actual invasion of Mex
ico by 12,000 troops is expected here
almost any minute. "It is a question
of mere hours," is the word that came
from Funston headquarters in San An
tonio.
Columbus was excited over two bits
of news and discussion at times even
overshadowed the larger fact of the
imminence of the start after Villa.
Troops Reported in Mexico.
First, the rumor would not be
downed that 1,500 picked American
cavalry, with light equipment for a
two weeks' campaign, have been on
Villa's trail for at least two days. The
military censorship prevents confirma
tion of this report by a tally of the
American cavalry troops. Then Colum
bus almost lost its breath when word
was flashed from Mexico that Carranza
had asked for two we'eks* time in

proximity to some of the entrench

"This is a matter of saving lives,

That a flying column of 1,500 Ameri

crossed the border early Tuesday, is
persistently asserted by men in close
