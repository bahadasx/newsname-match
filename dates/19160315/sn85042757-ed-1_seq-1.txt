VILLA MUST DIE.
Attacked Columbus, New Mexico, and
Kiiied 17 People, Last Week.
LaRt week, Villa, the Mexican ban
dit, attacked Columbus, New Mexico.
and killed seventeen Americans, in-j
eluding soldiers, f he attack was mauS
In the night, bouses were fired and tne
people shot as they rushed from the
burning buildings.
A company of infantry was stationed
there and quickly got into action and
made it so hot tor the bandits that
they soon left, but not be until Villa's
highest officer and over fifty others of
tbe bandits had been killed. Villa
made his escape.
President Wilson has ordered the
army to get Villa at any cost and
troops will be or have been sent across
the Mexican border after Villa and his
men. Villa is said to have close to
3,000 mtn distributed throughout the
mountains and the task ot killing or
capturing them is a hard one.
In order to pacify President Carran
za, ot Mexico, President Wilson has
agreed that Mexican troops may cross
to tbe American side when after ban
dits. The president has made it very
plaiB thai there is no intention what
ever on the part ot this government to
violate Mexican rights, but simply to
exterminate the bandits and capture or
kill Villa.
No trouble between this country and
Mexico is expected.
ALCOHOL AND PNEUMONIA.
Alcohol Is Great Aid to Pneumenia as
Well 9 Other Diseases.
The United States Public Health
Service brands strong drink as the
most efficient ally "f pneumonia. It
declares that alcohol is the handmaiden
of the disease which produces ten per
cent of the deaths in the United States.
This is no exaggeration. We have
known for a long time that indulgence
in alcoholic liquors lowers the individ
ual vitality, and that the man who
drinks is peculiarly susceptible to
pneumonia.
The United States Public Health
Service is a conservative body. It
does not engsge in alarmist propa
ganda. In following out the line ot
its official duties it has brought force
fully to the general public a fact that
will bear endless repetition. The lib
eral and continuous user of alcoholic
drinks will do well to heed this warn
ing particularly at this season ot the
year when the gruesome death
from pneumonia is being doubled.

Lowenthal
The home cf J. P. Sharp was entire
ly destroyed by tire between ten and
eleven o'clock Thursday night. It
seems that coal oil was put on the
house anil Hie set to it. Mr. Shaip
was at Kingston at the time and only
his wile and live small children were
at home. Mrs. Sharp awoke before
the hre made great progress and made
attempts to htop it, but owing to the
large amount of oil, could do nothing.
They saved very few things; nearly all
their clothes were destroyed. The
smoke house which stood near by was
also burned. J C. Loden saw the hre
from his home two miles away and to
gether with Tom and Roy Loden hur
ried to the burning house, but were too
late to save anything. Mr. Sharp is a
man of small means and the loss was a
hard blow. The many friends of the
family extend their deepest sympathy
in their loss.
Kichard Smith, of Toe String Valley,
visited relatives here Saturday and
Sunday.

WHEN HONEYMOON IS OVER
Getting Down to the Real Business of
Life Generally Found to Be a
Serious Proposition.
Ifs after the honeymoon that real
living begins. All that precedes it is
so lntoxic&tlngly romantic that peo
ple are not responsible At least their
dreams are to be taken with a good
margin. But after all the fusi , and
flowers and ','God-bless-yous," there is
the problem of getting down to real
living. Then will come the hustle for
business, the grocer's bills, and the
rent. Perhaps sickness may take a
band in affairs, or other things inject
a loss. If you are living up to the
last dollar or beyond It hardship must
follow.
If love is to survive the second year
after the honeymoon people must be
considerate. Neither will expect the
other to do what is beyond the com
mon means. Each will sympathize
with the other's efforts and co-operate
for the common weal. You two are
the builders of your future. Let good
sense keep you within the bounds at
the start and then you will be able to
improve with the year. The bigger
fool you are before the Honeymoon
the greater the come-down after it.
The start now will be the inspiration
for the future. Pennsylvania Grit.
SCENTS MAKE FOR HEALTH
Among 'Other Important Matters Is
Their Tendency to Promote the
Hab of Deep Breathing.
When w imell a beautiful flower
we breath' deeply, we expand the
chest, we it ' ale; our whole being ex
pands with ' ollght, which alone is ben
eficial, for 10 underbreathe is a fault
which most ev-yone is guilty of, es
pecially if on- is tired.
If the air ot each room was laden
with a differ i scent, it would tempt
one to breathe more deeply in passing
from room to room encountering the
different scents. In fact, to breathe
deeply would soon become a habit,
and in this maner the lungs would ex
pand and be brought into greater ac
tivity, which in turn would produce a
better state of health this leads to
youth and beauty.
In fact, flowers and scents are a
physical benefit to the weary house
wife and mother, as well as the woman
of leisure, ant are equally beneficial
to the busy man, clerk, stenographer,
student, or anyone deeply engrossed
in thought. The artist finds them val
uable, not alone for their scent, but for
the inspiration gained from color.
Your Wrist-Watch.
It is a marvel of minute workman
ship. It is one of the most wonderful
things the human hand fashions. The
pivot of the balance-wheel has a
diameter measured by the two hun
dredth part of an Inch and, more mar
velous still, in order that the pivot
may have free play, the jewel-hole into
which it fits is exactly one five-thousandth
part of an inch larger. The
gauge which enables this to be done
measures to the ten-thousandth part of
an inch. But not only are the screws
of a watch as minute as its bolts, but
they have a thread just like the big
screws you drive into the door, but the
thread of the watch's screw has as
many as 260 turns to the inch. What
is called a pallet jewel in a watch
weighs abound when there are 150,000
of them, and of the roller jewel it
would need 256,000. The largest round
hair-spring stud in your watch is the
four-hundredth of an inch in diameter
and nlne-hundredths of an inch in
length.
Value of Art,
The managers of a certain evening
newspaper that publishes a great
many pictures found it necessary to
cut expenses. They dismissed a spe
cial writer and two reporters, and
most of the other employees became
nervous about their positions. There
was one man, however, who was not
uneasy. He worked in what was
called the art department.
One of bis friends said to him, "Why
aren't you afraid of losing your Job?"
"Oh, they can't fire me," he replied.
"Why not? They are cutting all
along the line. Why do you feel safe?"
"Well, you see, our paper cannot af
ford to make a cut In Its art depart
ment. We have to many subscribers
who can't read!" Youth's Companion.
T. C. LIKELY TO BE SOLD,
To Come Before Judge Sanford tor Dis
posal Next Month.
Several conferences have been held
by Mayor Ewing and lending Nashville
citizens relative to tbe one million dol
lars ot stock that Nashville holds in
the Tennessee Central. It is generally
admitted that the T. C. stock held by
Nashville is worthless because ot the
heavy bonded indebtedness of the road
which amounts to more than eleven
millions ot dollars. It is not expected
that the road will bring much, if any,
in excess ot that amount.
The toad has been in tbe hands of re-
ceivers for nearly three years and dur
ing that time has not met expenses by
$500,000. Aside from the eleven mil
lions of first and second mortgage
bonds there is due and unpaid three
millions of interest on the second mort
gage bonds.
Thus far indications point to the
road being purchased by the Illinois
Central and Southern Railway, as fore
casted in these columns some weeks
ago. Such an ownership seems to be
the best for Nashville snd would cer
tainly prove best tor this section.
This county holds fifty thousand in
stock of tne road and when the road is
sold is practically sure to be lost just
as will the one million stock held by
Nashville. The road has run down
greatly since being placed in the hands
of receivers and much work will be
necessary to bring it to a condition
where it would prove a paying proposi
tion for any road that might acquire it.
The sooner it is sold the better for
the road and all persons considered for
it is constantly depreciating, the ser
vice rendered the public is poor and
nothing touching rates can be effected
as the receivers will take no action
along that line because of their short
tenure of office.
ANDERSON LOSES.
The "Indian" doctor, Anderson, who
has aroused so much talk by his treat
ment of patients and his escapades
witn a white girl for some months
past, was found guilty of practicing
medicine without license by the court
of Civil Appeals, at Jackson, last
week. The punishment was fixed at
ten days in jail and a two hundred and
fifty dollar tine.
That will put him out of business
and drive him from tha state as it
would be impossible for him to stand
such punishment for each offense and
as prosecution would surely follow in
every instance he will have to cease
practice.

The potatoes grown here are splendid
tor seed and our farmers would do ell
to plant a few acres late for seed pur

good chance for a profitable crop, but
thus far we have heard of aofone going
into growing aeed potatoes.

fields set aside for demonstration pur
poses, and showing us how to work
some of the machinery Bent by the
railroad company. While here Mr.
llefiin was outspoken in nis praise of
the mountain soil. He says that it is
far superior to that in and around
Tuilahoma, and that there is no reason
whatever to keep Cumberland Plateau
from being the leading farming section
of the state. He says we have the
necessary requisites : good land and
plenty of it. We Cumberland mount
aineers ought to get busy and do some
thing; we should grasp the opportunity
before some one from the outside get3
the best of what there Is here. Let's
get busy and make this old mountain
country known all over the commercial
world; let's make our products the
best. Let's make "raised on Cumber
land Plateau" bring better prices be
cause of superior quality; and let's
make that quality known everywhere.
We can do it, but it will take work,

reward in fine homes, good schools,
live churcheB and a contented popula
tion. Let s get busy.

the Agricultural Expert for White

will be heard from along about corn
gathering time, next fall. Besides the
discussion of corn, Mr. Franklin will
go into particulars of potato growing.
It is our aesire to raise several cars of
Irish potatoes for the market, and
everyone who will farm has expressed
a willingness to plant a surplus of this
crop. At this meeting will be discuss
ed the proper varities to plant, and
there is a movement on foot to per
suade" everyone to plant the same kind
in order to make a better show when
shipped. Our Crossville neighbors
have already had quite a lot of exper
ience along tbis line, and no doubt can
give us some of their experience, which

some of the mistakes they have made.
We will appreciate any help along this
line.
