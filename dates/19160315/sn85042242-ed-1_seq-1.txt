Verdun, was redoubled today after
which the German infantry pierced
the attack in this sector. They were

Provident Insurance Company of
Bismarck Held Important
Meeting.
The first annual meeting of stock­
holders of the Provident Insurance
Company of Bismarck was held in
this city yesterday, and an institution
of great promise may now be said to
have been successfully launched. The
company was incorporated a year ago,
and will be ready to commence busi­
ness as soon as policy forms and rate
books, now in process cf preparation,
are completed.
In addition to the consideration of
reports and routine business, the
most important transaction at yester­
day's meeting was the election of a
board of fifteen directors, which re­
sulted as follows:
The Board of Directors.
W. C. Taylor, commissioner of in­
surance, Bismarck.
John E. Renter, vice president of
the First State Bank of Underwood.

Stock Widely Distributed.
!A unique feature in the organiza­
tion of this company is the wide dis­
tribution of the stock. No less than
six hundred citizens of this state and
of South Dakota, who believe in
"keeping the money at home" and in
the upbuilding of a substantial home
life insurance company, have sub­
scribed for its stock. The administra­
tive affairs of the company have been
placed in the hands of men who have
had exceptional experience and train­
ing along insurance lines, and who,
with the assistance of others who will
be employed, will at once engage in
establishing an extensive agency
plant in this state. The officers of the
company have been assured of the
hearty co-operation of the stock-hold­
ers in this enterprise.

nop CALL
First Presbyterian Church of
Bozeman Extends Him Strong
Invitation.
iDr. Clias. \V. Harris of this city
has been invited to become the pastor
of the First Presbyterian church of
Bozeman, Mont.
The call, which was unanimous, is
extended by one of the strongest
Montana churches. It is the pioneer
Presbyterian church in the state, and
was founded by Sheldon Jackson in
1872. Its membership approximates
500. It is a center of influence in a
large and growing town. It serves
the state college of agriculture and
engineering, with a student body of
700. Its fine church- building, recent­
ly erected, at a cost of $60,000, af­
fords ample facility for its work.
Eozeman is a flourishing city of
8,000, the trading center of Gallatin
valley. It is a beautiful town, sur­
rounded by mountains, only 70 miles
from Yellowstone Park, and is the
head of a valley known all over the
country for its amazing fertility.
Dr. Harris has not said whether he
will accept the call or not, but wfM
announce his decision next Sunday

Medora.
ENTHUSIASTIC MEETING
HELD AT FARGO
Old-Time Frontier Day to Be Of­
fered in Honor of Oc­
casion.
Fargo, N. D., March 14.—The
"Bridge that Boost Built," spanning
the Little Missouri at Medora will be
opened July 24 and 25 with fitting
ceremonies and with a feast of attrac­
tions which is expected to bring hun­
dreds of touring parties from all of
the states traversed by the Red Trail.
Dates for the event which will mark
so important a milestone in the life ot
the National Parks Transcontinental
highway were set at the first annual
meeting of the association held in the
Commercial club rooms today. The
latter part of July was selected for
the dedicatory exercises as the season
when good weather will be most cer­
tain when crops will least interfere
with the attendance of farmers along
the highway, and when travel over
the trail to the Yellowstone and other
national parks will be at i*s height.
Frontier Day Planned.
Medora promises a replica of the
famous frontier day and rodio which
it staged last summer as a special
feature for the two days' celebration.
The Billings county seat, one of the
last of the old-time cow-towns, lias at
its command the very best talent in
America: it' lias a, splendid natural
amphitheatre, and if is believed thai,
with the advertising and publicity
which the Red Trail association ex­
pects to give the event thousands of
tourists from all
parts
of the middle
west can be induced to attend.
The committee headed by J. P.
Hardy, which is to have charge of the
general arrangements, will meet with
the sub-coinmittee in Medora soon
and will complete its plans. It' is ex­
pected that the governors of Minne­
sota, North Dakota and Montana, and
possibly the chief executives of other
states, will participate, and the inter­
est of big men in the business world
will be enlisted. There is an excel­
lent possibility that Theodore Roose­
velt, an old-time Medora citizen, may
be "among those present," and that
he may be persuaded to prove such
prowess as he may have retained with
the rope.
Officers Named.
Officers were named for the ensuing
year by unanimous batllot as follows:
President—W. Smith, Fargo.
First vice president—W. J. Ray,
Medora.
Secretary—J. P. Hardy, Fargo.
Treasurer—John Orchard, Dickin
son.
W. E. Lahr of Bismarck was named
vice president for Burleigh county,
vice Grant Call, who resigned upon
his removal to Montana several
months ago.
Intensive Organization Planned.
Resolutions were adopted providing
for an intensive organization in every
county along the trail: for the proper
financing of the organization, in order
that publicity work and other matters
requiring funds may receive suitable
attention for the organization of a
publicity bureau, which will see to it
that the trail receives its share of
recognition from the press, and re­
commending legislation which will as­
sure adequate mainteance for the
trail through all the states which it
traverses.
The meeting was a decidedly profit­
able one throughout, and thedeter
mination of its members to make tha
National l'arks Highway association
more than ever a factor in the build­
ing of good roads and a live force for
progress in the county thorugh which
it passes was freely evidenced.

CHURCH FIRE.
Abercrombie, N. T., March 14.
Fire broke out in the Lutheran
church, caused by-an overheated fur­
nace. Had it not been for the prompt
action of Olaf Oss and H. I. Moe in
calling the fire department, the beau­
tiful church would now be in ashes.
It took only a few minutes to get the
chemical engine to the church, and
the efficient work of the fire depart­
ment soon extinguished the blaze.

Spoke, .at |lckin60n.
•Dickinson, N. D., March 14.—Be­
tween 1,100 and 1,500 people were
present this evening in the armory to
hear Hon. Henry D. Estabrook, re­
publican presidential candidate, speak
upon the issues before the people of
the United States today. His speech
was listened to by people who came
from all parts of ilie country to hear
the celebrated logician speak on
"Preparedness."
America Must Defend.
In the course of his remarks lie
stated that America had more to de­
fend than just possessions, and said
in part:
"And America lias more than her
physical possessions to defend.
These, and her opportunities, she
willingly shares with all who come
to her. But the thoughts that are
hers, the ideas that are hers and hers
alone, she is bound to defend always,
in all ways, and against all comers.
Emerson says that the soul of God
is poured into the world' through the
thoughts of men. "The world," he
says, "stands on ideas, not on iron or
cotton and the iron of iron, the tire
of fire, the ether and source of all
elements is moral force. As cloud
on cloud, as snow on snow, as the
bird rests on the air and the planet
rests on space in its flight, so do na­
tions of men and their institutions
rest on—thought."
Loyal German-Americans.
"It is my candid opinion that there
is no healthier nor more loyal blood
in human arteries or that infiltrates
our American life, than the blood
pulsing in the heart of those who
either acknowledge Germany as their
fatherland or the German people as
their progenitors. These citizens of
ours, for the most part, have frankly
favored Germany against her enemies
in the field. Would any of you have
done otherwise if standing in their
shoes? It was un American who
pledged himself to his country right
or wrong, and we have often applaud­
ed his creed as voicing our very own.
A man may throw off his allegiance
to a government, but he cannot throw
off his consanguinity to a country or
its people. Personally, I appreciate
the sentiment that would link to the
home of one's children the home of
one's childhood, if only by a hyphen
for that hyphen—what is it but the
umbilical connection with mother
earth? And we do know that there
come events nd crises in events when
every hyphen, copula, Vinculum, an/1
all the Greek and Latin stuffing of
our language is knocked out of it, and
there stands forth the solid concrete
fact of citizenship! Think of that
heroic deed in Santiago harbor. Who
were the brave fellows who floated
into that maelstrom of shot and shell
just to put a cork in a bottle? An
Irishman or two a German or two
a Frenchman or two, and Clausen,
the stowaway—Clausen, a Swede, if
ever there was a Swede—Clausen, for
whom neither Spanish guns nor Am­
erican yardarms had terros to keep
him out of the melee. Save Hobson
himself, these men were foreigners
perhaps, but no greater Americanism
hath any man than this, that he is
willing to lay down his life for the
American republic.
"God forbid that it should ever be
the tragic fate of German-Americans

VOTE OVER STATE
WAS VERY LIGHT
Lynch Faction in Democratic
Party Are Claiming a
Victory.
:St. 'Paul, Minn., March 14.—Returns
up to midnight, from .Minnesota's first
presidential preference primary
strengthened early indications, that
Albert D. Cummins, United States
senator, of Iowa, led Henry D. 3Ssta
brook of New York by a wide margin
for the republican nomination.
Three hours after the polls had
closed not enough returns were in
to make the final result certain, but
available returns show Cununine led
decisively.
Characteristic of the trend of the
returns, the city of Marshall, in the
western part, of the state, gave Cum­
mins 112, and Estabrook 15, while
Faribault, in the southeastern part,
polled 365 votes for the Iowa senator
and !7 for Estabrook.
With the exctption of a few coun­
ties, where factional fights in the
democratic party had added interest
to the delegate contest, the vote
throughout the state was ligli. Wood
row .Wilson was unopposed for he
presidential nomination on the dem­
ocratic ballot, the contest for elec­
tion as delegates being waged be­
tween Fred Lynch and the co-called
anti-Lynch contingent. Early returns
gave no indication as to which fac­
tion would control the delegation to
the national convention at St. Louis,
but the Lynch adherents claimed vic­
tory.
Neither Eugene N. Walsh, Jormer
go'vernor of Massachusetts, nor Wil­
liam Sulzer, former governor of New
York, had a decided advantage on the
first returns in their contest for the
nomination for president on the pro­
hibition ticket.
VERY_RAPIDLY
Danger of Floods Is Imminent in
Many Places Fear Repetition
of 1910 Flood.
Considerable anxiety is manifested
by the people who live in the low
country adjacent to the Missouri river
on account of the rapidly rising wat­
ers of the stream. Huge gorges of ice
in the headwaters of the river have
given way and the reservoirs estab­
lished by the gorges are being emp­
tied into the main channel of the Mis­
souri and swelling its already turbu­
lent waters.
Ice Out At Williston.
At Williston the ice is reported go­
ing out. Water is very high. At San
ish the river has risen six feet' in a
few hours. From Sanish on south
ward until near the confluence of the
James and Missouri rivers the ice is
still solid and the water is flowing
over the ice to a considerable depth.
May Form Jam At Bridge.
The Northern Pacific is in readi­
ness to protect ihe great steel bridge
from a jam which is believed will
form against the piers and cause the
river to rise so that portions of Man
dan may be submerged. At other
places fears are entertained that the
river will rise above the banks and
inundate a large area.
Fear Repetition of 1910 Flood.
In 1910 a huge gorge formed be­
tween this city and Mandan and por­
tions of the railroad grade washed
away. The waters were so high that
in several places in Mandan" the peo­
ple had to leave their homes and go
to higher points and a store house
containing lime was destroyed by fire
and water caused by the latter slack­
ing the lime.
Yankton Flood Receding.
Reports from Yankton, S. D., state
danger of further damage by flood
and ice
gorges
has past. The waters
are subsiding and railroad traffic is
being rapidly restored to its normal
condition. Farmers and ranchers,
•who were forced to leave their homes
in the lower lands, are preparing to
return to their homes. Much live­
stock and large quantities of hay
were destroyed by the flood and many
bridges were washed out by gorges.

Congress Takes Steps to Make
More Troops Available for
Mexico
SOUTHERN REPUBLICS
ARE ALL NOTIFIED
Washington, March 14.—While
there were indications in official dis­
patches from Mexicans today that the
de facto government was making a
supreme effort to capture Villa with
their own forces, there was no sign
that the orders of General Funston to
proceed had been modified in anyway.
Word that the American troops had
crossed the border was still lacking,
the war department itself not having
been advised as to when the move­
ment would begin.
Congress tooK active notice of the
border situation today for the lirst
time. The house passeu a joint reso­
lution late in the day. authorizing the
recruiting of the mobile regular army
to full strength. This means the ad­
dition of approximately 20,0-01) light­
ing men to the infantry, cavalry and
field artillery. The senate is expect­
ed to concur tomorrow, and the neces­
sary orders will be issued immediate­
ly to lill up regiments on border duty.
Troops Needed Badly.
The step was suggested by the
army general staff. It is urgently de­
sired now because of the weakening
of the border forces by the expedition
after Villa, but ever since the patrol
of the border began, the army lias
been greatly handicapped by the skel­
eton organization of regiments, com­
panies, troops and batteries. The
force that occupied Vera Cruz had
similar difficulties, some of the com­
panies there being less than 40 men
strong.
Secretary Baker conferred today
with Senator Chamberlain and Repre­
sentative Hay, chairman of the con­
gressional military committee, and
later Representative Hay returned to
the war department accompanied by
Representative Kahn, arnking Repub­
lican member of the house commit­
tee. The resolution was introduced
by Representative Hay immediately
on his return to the capitol. Its con­
sideration was expedited by unani­
mous consent and its passage follow­
ed with only Representative Lundon,
Socialist, voting against it.
Guard Official Information.
At the state department, steps were
taken to make ita certain that its re­
ported version of the American pur­
pose of sending armed forces against
the border were not given wide circu­
lation in Mexico.
By cable, radio, telegraph and mail,
full statements of all that has tran­
spired since the rain upon Columbus
and of the action of the United States
government and its reciprocal agree­
ment with the Carranza government
went forward to consuls and state de­
partment agents thorughout the south­
ern republics.
It is understood the department has
cautioned General Funston against
too full a publication of his plans, or
of the purpose behind orders to var­
ious
units
of his force. Four news­
paper correspondents were officially
designated during the day to accom
nany the expedition and orders were
issued for their credentials.
STATE El
Dealing With Road Construction,
and Township and County
Systems.
State Engineer J. :W. Bliss has is­
sued a bulletin dealing with the con­
struction and maintenance of earth
roads This is the first bulletin of
this character that has been distrib­
uted by the state engineer's office.
The bulletin deals with county and
township road systems, location of
roads, grades, preservation of section
corners, drainage and road construc­
tion and maintenance, and is intended
for the use of township and county
road officials.
The state engineer has but little
money which can be devoted to this
purpose, and only a limited number
of copies will be available. Copies
have been furnished all county aud­
itors in time to be used at the meet­
ing of the county board of highway
improvements, which was created by
Chapter 110 of the 1915 Session
Laws.

MOVING PICTURE MEN
ARE DISAPPOINTED
Censorship So Rigid Little News
Leaks Through the
Lines.
El Paso, Tex., March 14.—Through
the thick veil of censorship which
has been established by General
Funston, sufficient information leaked
through today to confirm the belief
that the advance guard of the first
expeditionary force may start in pur­
suit of Villa in time to be measured
by hours. The main force may not
start for two or three days.
While the border waited in expect­
ancy for word that United States sol­
diers had crossed the international
line, reports flowed in from .Mexican
source to the effect that Mexican ban­
dits already had been surrounded by
troops of Carranza.
"The first chief" was apparently
making strenuous efforts to anticipate
(Americans and was reported from
several sources to have concentrated
more than 10,000 troops at different
points above the Casa Grandes region
in Chihuahua, vyhere V1I1& is sup­
posed to be.
The officers of the Tenth Cavalry
left here today for Columbus shortly
after it was learned that the passage
of transport trains between here'and
he scene of the Villa raid had ceased.
They were practically the last of the
corps who were -stationed here.
Censorship fs Strict
On account of the censorship this
little definite news that reached herf
from Columbus was brought by in­
coming passengers. They reported
that while military activities were be­
ing carried forward at feverish speed,
the indications were that it would be
some days at least before the main
punitive force moves. It is consider­
ed likely, however, that some ad­
vance scouting parties may cross the
border within the next 24 hours.
Can't Take Movies.
A number of motion picture men
who hurried out of here early in the
day, believing that the crossing was
about to be effected, returned here
disappointed. They reported that
General Pershing in command of the
expedition had issued positive orders
that no pictures could be taken.
The strong undercurrent of excite­
ment along the border was cleared
today by news that a Southern Pa­
cific train had been fired upon at He­
len, Texas, 17 miles east of here.
Villa Men Jailed.
The local police continue to arrest
(Mexicans who wrere supposed to be
in communication with Villa and all
former officers, generals or cabinet
ministers of Villa are now in jail
here-
"I hope that we shall take Villa
soon—with the help of the United
States," said General Gabriel Gavira
tonight, commanding the Carranza
forces at Juarez.
Gavira made this remark in Eng­
lish in his office. General Gutierrez,
commander-in-chief of Chihuahua, was
present.
Both officers spent the entire day
in conference, largely in the company
of Andreas Garcia, the iMexlcan con­
sul in El Paso, who has a' wide ac­
quaintance with American affairs.
From what information has been
given out at headquarters, the Car­
ranza forces are making a determined
effort to catch Villa before the Am­
ericans get the opportunity.
Gutierrez said he has 16,000 men,
closing in on the bandits, who were
last reported at Alamo, some miles
directly south of Oaleana.

Alexander Abbott, a single man, Wha
formerly resided southeast of town,
