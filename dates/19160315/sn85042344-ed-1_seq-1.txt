EL PASO, Texas, March 14.
Through the thick veil of censor
ship which litis been established by
General Funstnn sufficient Informa
tion leaked through toduy to confirm
the belief tliut the advance gourd of
1 ho first expeditionary forte may
start ill pursuit of Villa in a time to
lie measured by hours. The main force
inav not start for two or three days.
While the border nailed in keen ex
pectancy for word that I'niled States
soldiers had crossed the international
line reports flowed ill from Mexican
sources to the effect that Mexico's
arch-bandit already had been sur
rounded by the troops of Carranza.
The "first chief" uppurt ntly was mak
ing strenuous efforts to assist Amer
icans and was reported from several
sources to have concentrated more
-than ten thousand troops at different
points about t'asas (irande.s region In
Chihuahua where Villa is supposed
to be.

it'' transport trains between hen- and
the scene id the illia raid bad
eased. They were prai'ticady the
last ol the corps officers who were
stationed here. The stoppage of iho
transport trains was rcgi'idcd as par
ticularly significant as their move
ment hail never ceased night or day
wince the news of the Columbus raid
v. us flushed throughout the country.
Their stopping now is taker, to mean
that the concentration of supplies lit
Columbus has been practically com
, vleted.
tin account (ti the censorship the
little ilelinlte nevvs that reached here
from Columbus was brought by in
coming passengers. The reported
that, while military activities wire be
ing; carried iorward at feverish spend,
the indications were that it would oe
home days at least before the main
punitive force moved. It is consid
ered likely, however, that some ad
vance scouting parlies may cross the
bonier within the next 21 hours.

A number of motion picture limn
who hurried out of here early tmlav
in the belief that the crossing wis
nbout to be effected, returned here
disappointed. They reported that
general I'ersblng, in command of the
expedition, had Issued positive, orders
that no pictures could be taken.
The strong undercurrent of excite
ment along file border was stirred to
day by news that a Southern Pacific
train had been fired upon at Helen,
Texas, 17 miles east of here. Con
ductor lingers in charge of the train
saving that several shots had been
fired from underbrush near the sta
tion. The local police continued to
arrest Mexicans who were supposed
to be In eoinniuniation with the
Villistas and II, all former officers,
generals or cabinet ministers of Villa,
lire now In jail here. While there has
been no disturbance of any kind here,
the apprehension felt by the Ameri
can population was indicated by
heavy sales of guns and ammunition
in the last few days, tiun stores re
'"ported today that they were almost
I'ompletely sold out of ammunition.

FILMED IN COURT

HE BROKE A BANK?
Mismanagement of Affairs
Laid at Door of Ousted
U. S. Senator.
C lib 'Ado, March 14. William
l.orimer, w hose seat in the United
Slates senate was declared vacant on
the ground thai it was the result of a
political crime, today listened to a re
cital of his alleged financial crimes.
The recital was by William II.
Holly, assistant state's attorney, who
told a Jury In criminal court that the
defendant was charged with con
spiracy und embezzlement In connec
tion with the failure of the l.a Salle
Street Trust & Savings bank in Chi
cago two years ago. Mr. Uirimcr re
mained imperturbable throughout the
denunciation.
Mr. Holly said that testimony that
was not adduced nt the trial of C. Tt.
Munday. senior vice-president of the
bank, who was convicted on similar
charge's, would be Introduced during
the present hearing.
l.orimcr's defense, it Is said, will be
based largely on tin; contention that
Mr. f.orimer. although president of
the institution, trusted the business to
Mr. Munday und was himself absent
much of the time.
Many Had Ixians.
Lorimer started the Im Salle Street
National bank in 1910 when he was
in the I'nited States senate, Mr. Holly
related.
"We sliull contend." said Mr. Holly,
"that Mr. l.orimer was In a position
to Influence the national bank ex
aminer. There was a larue amount
of bad paper In the bank. The owners
were political friends of the then sen
ator. P.ank officials made no effort
to get rid of tills paper but Instead
thr bank changed its charter from the
national to the stale form and be
came t ho Iji Salle Street Trust &
Savings bank."
The prosecutor went Into di'tail con
cerning loans made by the l.a Salle
bank to enterprises of Mr. l.orimer,
Mr. Munday and II. W, lluttig, the
cashier.
When the bank failed June 11.
1914. the prosecutor said that
$2.10i).0utl eif outstanding loans of
$3,31(0,000 had been loaned to enter
prises of the three officers named.

After the prosecution had rested

that the law did not give Dr. Rudolph

without authorization of the commis
