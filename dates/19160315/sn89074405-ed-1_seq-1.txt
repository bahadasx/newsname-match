departure of Consul Williams from
Torreon. They ha& given him no in

Still they realize that the consul must

GRAND FORKS, N. D., WEDNESDAY EVENING, MARCH 15, 1916. TEN PAGES—PRICE FIVE CENTS.
E| Paso, Tex., March 15.—The point
chosen for the entrance of the Ameri
can expedition into Mexico is at the
verge of a dreary, desolate plain, in
habited principally by coyotes and
prairie dogs, swept by sandstorms
and denuded of vegetation except cac
tus and a few other spiky, objection
able growths.
Desert March.
For at least 30 miles the soldiers
of the United States must make their
way across this desert. They will then
reach the lowest range of the Sierra
Marde mountains rising to a height of
from 3,000 to 3,500 feet, broken and
twisted into all manner of fantastic
shapes by volcanic action, and as bar
ren of verdure ..worthy of the name
as the desert over which they frown.
Lonely, half-civilized ranchmen are
found here and there in the valleys,
nursing their cattle at infrequent,
scanty water holes, and subsisting al
most entirely on beef. To offset the
results of the continuous diet of flesh
they drink the blood of cattle which
contains supposedly healthy salts.

mons yesterday the entry of Portugal
into the war. He confirmed the state
ment that the British government
had urged Portugal to rtqdisitioh the
German ships and said that Portugal
promised eventually to indemnify the
owners.
"Hie secretary argued that the right
in an emergency to requisition prop
erty of all individuals and convert.it
to public use was a right, inherent in
every land and could not be challeng
ed by any foreign power. Portugal,
however, was not a neutral. state in

The mountains are split by many can

there being not even a recognized

From Casas Grandes south, how
