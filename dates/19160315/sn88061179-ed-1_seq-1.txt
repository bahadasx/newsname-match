The small detachment of
troopers under MajorTompkins
and Miner Linsloy lighting dis
mounted made a determined
stand against the renewed Vilia
attack, and lit last reports were
holding their ground.
Creep Upon Sleeping Town.
Tin1 raid on Amoniciili terri?
tory proved costly to thobandit
chief tains. The bodies of IS
bandits, including Pablo Lope/.,
second in command, had been
gathered and burned hefore
noon and troopers reported an
undetermined number still ly?
ing in the brush.
Led to the attack under the
slogan: ''Death to the Amer?
icans," Villa's followers fought
with desperation. Just hefore
dawn they crept along ditches
skirting the United states cav?
alry camp and rushed upon the
sleeping town, bring heavily.
The lirst volley brought
American troopers into almost,
instant action. While a portion
of the raiders engaged the cav?
alrymen, others began applying
the torch and shooting Auri
?can civilians who ventured
from the buildings: Lights in
homes and public buildings im?
mediately became targets' for
snipers posted at Villa's tlirec

Tioops Ordered Into Mexico.
Washington, March lOlh.?
President Wilson today ordered
American troops over tie- Mex?
ican border to capture or kill
the Villa bandits who yestordit)
raided Columbus, causing a loss
of sixteen American lives.
Major General Scott, chief of
Btalf of the army, announced
that the expedition would con
sist of not less than 5,000 men,
all of which are available on
the border under Major liem-rul
Fuuston.
In its present stage the presi?
dent's order does not mean arm?
ed intervention in Mexico, It
provides for a punitive expedi?
tion to deal with lawless forces
over which the Carrau/.u gov?
ernment has no control.
The following statement was
issued at the white house:
"A.u adequate force will he
sent at once in pursuit of Villa
with the single object nf captur?
ing him and putting a stop to
his forays. This can he done
and will be done in entirely
friendly aid of the constituted
authorities in .Mexico and with
scrupulous respect for the .sov?
ereignty of that republic."
May Mobilize The Navy.
No orders have been issued to
the navy this afternoon, Lut it
was considered probable that
sonic of the Atlantic fleet might
be placed in Mexican waters to
be near if Americans in coast
towns were odd angered by ttnti
American demonstrations.
The government is relunctant
to make any naval demonstra
tion that might he construed as
against Getieral Oarranza.
It was explained at the white
house that the American gov?
ernment wants Villa dead or
alive, and that no steps will bo
neglected to curry out this nl>
ject
The cabinet WU8 unanimous
in deciding that VfIIa must be
caught.
President Wilson and the

tion of whether a column of
troops should be Bent into Mex
ico to capture Villa and Iiis
baud of bandits.

government sincerely regrets
this atl'air and asks the Ameri?
can people to be patient," said
Marceliuo Duviiids, foreign min?
ister of the Car ran/.a cabinet in
a statement to the Associated
Press today.
"The government asks Ihe
American people to remember
that Villa is a common enemy."

Norfolk & Western Is Forg?
ing Ahead.
It is how definitely under?
stood, says the Blueiield Tele
graph, that the Norfold & \Vest
eru will enter the rich coal
fields of Buchanan county. The
road of tho llonakcr Lumber
Company will he used from
tiunuker to "Big A" mountain,
which the N. ?c W. will tunnel
instead of winding across the
top as the lumber road does.
The Chesapeake' & Ohio, also,
is coining in on the north
side and w ill have easy grade
all the way up the river to
IQrundy. It seems as though
these two roads will beat the
Virginian to this field. The lat?
ter road will have so much
more mileage to build from
Prinston that it is probable that
it will abandon the idea of com
ing into Buchanan county alto?
gether.

A Storehouse For Diseases
That Wreck The System
And Cause Much
Misery.
The human body unless giv?
en careful attention will con?
tract all kinds of germs that
will eventually wear down the
working organs and cause sick?
ness. Mrs. P. S. Co,ike. of 10
K. nth Street, Richmond, Va.,
said in regard lo this, "1 hail
an a vful amount of gas on my
Btotll tell and was very weak
and run down. My appetite
was poor and everything I ate
cans id a fullness in my throat
and I suffered from severe head?
aches. My bladder and kid?
neys also gave me trouble, I
decided to try Tanlac ami now
I am not troubled with gas and
my kidneys and bladder are bet?

every day. My general con?

Paper Increase Causes Worry
in Printing Trade.
Uncertainty as to future prico
of printing paper is causing un?
easiness in the printing busi?
ness. Scarcity of both dye
stuffs and other material used
in tli" manufacture of paper has
driven the price of paper up?
ward f: ??;11 to 50 per cent.,
according to dealers, and print?
ing ink also is much higher.
Some paper nulls have stopped
in iking certain kinds of paper
altogether because they are tin
able to secure the proper color?
ing material: This is especially
true with regard to blue, yellow
net red paper; Paper mills are
refusing to quote prices for the
future and have withdrawn all
price lists. In addition to the
aok of dyes the scarcity of rags
is making itself felt. As in so
many other instances the
European war is being blamed
for the situation.
Immense stores of rags in
warehouses two years ago have
b-'en u~e i. and no supplement?
ary supplies have reached tins
country formtiny months, ac?
cording to Krank Puerck,
superintendent of the Courier
journal Job Printing Company,
and C- C. Otisley, president of
the Kentucky Print Shop. Both
said printing ink of certain
col a s can not he had at all,
while other kinds cost from 20
to 300 per cent more than
formerly. ? Louisville Courior

DR. DOUGHERTY.

cal views are different from
those of Dr. Dougherty, but we
are frank in our admiration of
Dr. Dougherty as a citizen. The
Republicans would honor them
selves in si b eting him as a
