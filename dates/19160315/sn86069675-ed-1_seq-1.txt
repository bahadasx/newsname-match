PROTECT OUR
MERCHANTS
Violators of Occupation Ordinance
(Should Be Reported and
Prosecuted Promptly.
In tho last few days wo havo
heard a number of local merchants
complaining that tho ordnianco gov
erning tho occupation tax, etc.,
was not being rigidly enforced
Thoy claimed that thcro wero men
canvassing tho city selling various
articles such as clothing, druggets,
etc., and that these men represented
no stora and paid no licenso and
seemed under the impression that
tho local policemen should look
after this matter. After an invest!
gation wo havo ascertained that no
officer can make an arrest without
a warrant, unless he sees tho of
fenso committed and we would
suggest that- any merchant that
knows tho law is being violated to
swear out a warrant-for the offend
er and wo aro sure that tho officials
will see that the law is enforced
promptly ana impartially. The local
merchant should bo given all the
protection to which ho is entitled
under the ordinance.
