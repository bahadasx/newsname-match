SANITARY SURVE
FOR GREEN!ILLEI
FEDERAL HEALTH EXPERTS TO
MAKE THOROUGH STUDY OF
COUNTY.
WORK TO COVER ONE YEAR
Complete Sanitary Inspection With
Especial Reference to Prevention
oflTyphoid Fever.
Columbia.-The United States pub
lic health service will undertake, com
mencing this week, a study of the con
ditions in Greenville county affecting
health, with especial reference to the
prevention of diseases such as typhoid
fever. This complete sanitary inpsec
tion, which will continue for a year or
more, covering every section of the
county, will be made as a result of the
requests of James A. Hayne, M.D.,
state health officer, in co-operation
'with county officials. All expenses of
the public health officers will be paid
by the government.
Dr. Hayne said a few days ago that
in urging this sanitary inspection for
a unit of this state he had recommend
ed that the work be done either in
Greenville county or Richland county,
but that the government had chosen
the former because of its greater per
cent of white population and also be
cause it appeared to be a more repre
sentative South Carolina county. He
said also that he would probably trans
fer one of the two units provided for
by the legislature to Richland county.
where also he hopes to have the offi
cials of the public health service at
work.
A letter will be sent out in the near
future to all registered electors of
Greenville county notifying them of
the undertaking and asking for their
co-operation. "This study of health
conditions in your county," the letter
says in part, "is a part of a general
sanitary survey being made by the
public health service in representative
counties in a number of states. The
main purpose of this survey is to de
termine the sanitary conditions exist
ing in the rural districts generally of
the Unted States and the best methods
for their improvement.
"The officers who will visit the
homes in your county '~e trained in
sanitation and after making their
studies they will be able to advise
about. health. conditions, particularly
as to 'water supplies and refuse dis
posal in each neigh'vchood. These
men will learn from their studies in
your community fa"ts which may be
presented with . ad'antage to other
communities.
"The benefit to your community
from this undertaking by your nation
al, state and county governments wil
depend upon the active interest of the
individual citizens. If you and you
neighbors will give to the workers
and the work your cordial suppo~rt
and assistance your county can be
made one of the several most health
ful counties in the United States."

Greenwood Supports Library.
Greenwood.-The Greenwood city
ecuncil at its regular meeting recently
assed an ordinance appropriationg
the sum of $1,200 for the annual sup
port of the public library which it is
planned to have here. The city also
donated a magnificent lot, centrally
located. The advocates of the library
proposition want a $15,000 building as
they feel that this will be the size
building Greenwood should have
Condemns Oconee Land.
Greenvlle.-Judge Johnson of the
federal court has signed orders auth
orizing the publication of condemna
tion proceedings against six tracts. of
land in Oconee, the land to be set
aside as a part of the great Appala
chian forest reserve, being created by
he United States government. These
otices will be served upon the own
era of the land and will be inserted in*
newspapers. In such procedings, the
government does not condemn land
which is tilled or land upon which
there are permanent homes.
It is very probable that agricul-'
ture will be taugnt in the public
schools of St. Matthews next year.
"The population of Columbia at the
ensus of 1910 was 26,139," the bulle
tin says, "and It is estimated that it
was 33500 on July 1, 1914.

tanburg and Greenville was advocated

RIGID CENSORSHIP REGARDING
MOVEMENT AGAINST VILLA
. AND BANDITS.
THREE REGIMENTS ARE SENT
No Call For National Guard is- Con
templated.-Troops - May $ave
Crossed Borer.
Wshington.-Secrecy regarding Gen
eral Funston's plans for moving
against Villa and his bandits has been
so rigidly enforced at the war de
partment that even high officials of
the government are in doubt as to
whether American troops actually
bad crossed the Mexican border.
Secretary Baker announced that the
Twenty-third Infantry, now at Gal
veston, Tex., had been ordered to El
Paso because of fear of Mexican at
tacks felt in many towns along 'the'
border. The regiment, about 1,000
strong, will be stationed at points
designated by General Funston.
The order to the Twenty-third, the
Secretary said, -was -the only import
ant development of the day of which
the department had any- knowledge,
.and that nothing had' conie from any
other source indicating that the ad
vance guard of the expeditionary force
was already on Mexican soil. He said
he would make known the fact that
the expedition was on its way just as
soon as the news reached him.
Questioned as to the messages that
had come, the Secretary admitted that
there was nothing directly denying
reports that the border had been
crossed. He said he had nothing to
add to or detract from his previous
statement that General Funston had
full authority to 'proceed whenever he
was ready. The secretary emphasiz
ed the fact that any steps taken by
the army would be in full recognition
of Mexican sovereignty. He declined
to discuss further the question of
what action the de facto government
might take as a result of the sending
of American troops in pursuit of the
bandits.

United States Must' Not Send Armed
Force After Villa Without Recip

. Mexico City.-General Carranza is
sued a manifesto to the Nation declar
ing that under no circumstances
would the Mexican Government grant
the right to the United States to vio
late the Mexican territory by sending
in an armed force in pursuit of Villa
without consent and the reciprocal
privilege being first. obtained and ad
mitted.
'I am sure that I interpret in this

- that the Mexican people will comply
In a digiified manner with their duty
I be the sacrifice what they may, to
sustain their rights and. sovereignty
if, unfortunately, this drags us into
a war a war which the United States
can never justify. We will not be
responsible for the disastrous conse
quences. Upon the heads of the
traitorous Mexicans who within and
without this country have labored to
produce this result, will fall the inex
orable justice of the people.
"Because of the assault which Fran
cisco Villa and the bandits who oc
companied him made on the town of
Columbus, in Aemrican territory,
burning houses and killing some of
the inhabitants, soldiers as well as
civilians, the international situation
in these moments is very delicate as
the North American press have ex
cited their people against Mexico and
the government of that country has
discussed the situation in the Ameri
can Congress, members of which
have advised intervention.
"The constitutional government
which I have the honor to represent
is also occupied diligently in an ef
fort to solve this delicate situation,
trying at all costs to maintain the dig
nity and sovereignty of Mexico.
Historical Precendents Cited.
"I have addressed the Government
of the United States through. the for
eign office, stating that the invasion
of Villa has historical ' precendents,
as in the years 1880 and 1886 two par
ties of Indians coming from the Unit
ed States invaded Sonora and Chihua
hau, committing crimes and depreda
tions on the lives and properties of
Mexicans.
"It was then agreed between the
governments of the two countries to
Hermit the respective passage of arm
ed forces, resulting in the extermina
tion of the Indians. I have asked the
American Government to pursue a
like course in order to solve future
difficulties, should they arise, noting
that Villa and his companions are a
group of bandits, whose acts the
Mexican Government or people would
not be responsible for, and that his
reproachable conduct is due to insti
gations of the reactionary element,
that. lacking patriotism and convinc
ed of its defeat, is trying by all means
to bring on armed intervention.
"I have not yet received the
answer of the American Govern
ment and from the reports of my
chiefs along the fi-ontier I learn that
the Amnerican forces are mobilizing to
pursue and capture and deliver him
to the Mexican authorities; that the
expedition is in the nature of a puni
tive campaign, and that the sover
eignty of Mexico will be respected.
"The constitutional government has
given Instructions to its confidential
agent at Washington Immediately to
make representations that under no
circumstances will any motive, be the
reasons or explanations of the United
States what they may. ju.-7: th:e
a-med invasion of Mexican territory
without recinrocal rights being grant
ed to the M\exicans and that not for
an instant will the invasion of Mexican
territory or an outrage to its dignity
be tolerated.
"I am sure that in this I interpret
the national sentiment and that the
Mexican peonle will worthily comply
with their duty, be the sacrifices what
they may. to sustain their rights and
sovereignty. I!. unfortunately, we are
dragged into a war. which the United
States can never justify, we will not
be responsible for the disastrouz con
sequences. but will serve as instru
ments for Mexican traitors within and
without catr country w~ho have long
labored to produce this result and
upon thecir heads will fall the inexor

in my experience, one of the best
places for planting a pecan orchard Is
in the cotton field. Pecan trees are
very deep-rooted, feed far below the
surface, do not eicroach much on
the cotton land until they are big
enough to give a profit for its use.
Pecan trees should be set not less than
50 feet apart; 60 feet is better. In
these wide middles cotton and other
crops can be successfully cultivated
for years until the -trees require a
the land. In this way a planter need
not be out of the use of his land.
but can at the same time be gradually
changing an annual crop that adds
no permanent increment to the value
of his soil to a pere-inal one that
makes his land more valuable every
year it grows upon it. Of course, I
would not advise cotton planters to
put all their lands in pecan trees, but
Ido believe that every cotton planta
ton would be enhanced in value If
thad on it a larger or smaller pecan
rchard, if only of a few trees. A
special advantage of the cotton field
or pecan planting Is that the trees
re practically assured of cultivation.
have never seen a pecan orchard
that was a success unless it was cul
tvated. at least while the trees were
young. It is for this reason that I
prefer the term "pecan orchard" to
"pecan grove," for the latter term has
about it more of the idea of a green
nbroken turf, and, from my experi
nce, I am very sure that this is not
te condition conducive to large yields
fnuts. Professor Van Deman said,
"ature plants groves, but man plants
rchards."
Where maintenance crops are grown
n a pecan orchard, judgment .should
e exercised in not allowing the rows
o encroach too closely on the trees,
thus robbing them of the plant food
nd moistufre. If tnis is done, valuable
tme will be lost in getting the trees
Into bearing. Maintenance or cover
rops should not be allowed to grow
nearer than six feet to the tree row,
EED VALUE OF COTTONSEED
Not Equal to Meal Which Can Be
Used Without Fear of Causing
Disturbance in Digestion.
A reader asks if ground cottonseed
will make as good feed as the com
mercial cottonseed .neal.
The answer is plainly, no. From
te seed. to make meal, are taken the
hulls or a large part of them, and a
considerable portion of the oil. The
oil extracted is of high feeding value
to he extent that oil can be economi
caly used by the animal, but after all
te oil is removed that is practicable
bythe oil mills there is still more oil
tan necessary for feeding purposes
let in the meal.
One ton of meal is easily worth a
tn and a half of seed for feeding
purposes. Another advantage pos
sssed by the meal is that, contain
ig less oyil, it can be used to furnish
alarger part of the ration, without
cusing a disturbance in digestion
ad scouring or diarrhea.The Pro
