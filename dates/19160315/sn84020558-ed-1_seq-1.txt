TWENTY-SIXTH YEAR
GERMANS AGGRESSORS
IN HE A VY INFANTR Y
FIGHTING NEAR VERDUN

Republican A. P. Leased Wire
Kxtremely heavy infantry fighting
has taken place northwest of Verdun
and on the outskirts of the Bois Des
Buttes, to the north of the Aisne, with
the Germans in both regions the as
sessors. Elsewhere along the line ar
tillery duels of great proportions are
under way.
In the sector between Bethincourt
and Cumieres, northwest of Verdun, the
intense artillery bombardment of the
Germans was followed by an infantry
attack but over the entire front of three
miles it was repulsed by the French
with serious losses, except between
Bethincourt and Le Mort Homme,
where the Germans gained a footing at
two points in the French trenches.
The Germans to the north of the
Aisne threw their troops three times
against the French positions northwest
f the Bois Des Buttes, but none of the
attacks proved successful.
In the forest of Argonne the French
guns effectively shelled German posi
tions. North and east of Verdun the
artillery duels continue. To the north
uf St. Mihiel, in Lorraine, and in the
Yiiges mountains the guns' of both
sides have been active. A large num
ber of fights in the air have taken place
mound Verdun in which four German
aircraft have been brought, down.
French aviators again have bombarded
the station of Brieulles, behind the Ger
man lines north of Verdun.
The British evidently are breaking
up the opposition of the Senussi tribes
men, led by Turkish officers in western
Egypt. An official report received from
Major General 'Peyton, commander of
the British forces, says the occupation
if Solium, on the Egyptian-Tripoli
frontier, is imminent, that the Sheik
Harum has surrendered and is in the
British camp, and that the head men
of Auiad AH tribes are asking for par
dons. Russians still are harrassing the
Turks on the Caucasus front and have
made further progress against the
Teutons in East Gallcia. They entered
German trenches tn the region of Riga,
killed the occupants and returned to
their own positions without suffering
any loss.
The Italians are keeping up their
strong infantry offensive begun several
days ago on the Isonzo front. Espec
ially fierce have been the attacks
around San Martino. Here, Rome says,
the Italians captured Dante Del Gro
viglio, the pivot in the Austrian de
fenses, and in the same region stormed
two other places and seized Austrian
trenches.
Vienna, on the other hand, declares
thut near San Martino the Italians
seven times attempted to storm the
Austrian positions, but were repulsed
with heavy casualties.
Redouble Violence of Attacks
. PARIS, March 14. The violence of
the German bombardment of the French
positions between Bethincourt and Cu
mieres, to the northwest of Verdun,
was redoubled today after which the
German infantry fiercely attacked in
this sector. They were repulsed along
the whole front with serious losses ac
cording to the official statement is
sued tonight by the French war office.
The Germans, however, succeeded in
taking foot in the French trenches at
two points, between Bethincourt and
Le Morte Homme.
The Turkish government has decid
ed, in view of the danger of the Rus
sian advance, to concentrate all the
available forces of the empire against
Russia, according to semi-official ad
vices in Athens from Constantinople,
says a Havas correspondent.
A majority of the troops in Thrace,
nn the Smyrna coast, on the coast of
the sea of Marmora and in Asia-Minor,
the correspondent adds, will be sent to
Angolia, Asia-Minor. The Egyptian
and Mesopotamian expeditions are said
to have been completely abandoned.
Entente Allies Are Accused
BERLIN, (by wireless to Sayville.)
March 14. Entente allied submarines
are following the practice abandoned by
the Austro-Germans of attacking un
armed passenger ships without warn

the Austrian embassy today.
It was stated at the embassy that a
hostile submarine fired torpedoes, with
out the slightest warning, at the Aus

diate construction of eight or nine bat

strength now lacking the Amarican
fleet, was urged before the house naval
committee today by Captain Sims,
commanding the battleship Nevada.
The captain advised also the building
of many additional destroyers. He said
that while much had been accomplished
toward making armored ships less vul
nerable to torpedoes, there had been no
solution of the problem of protecing
a fleet against torpedo attack in open
sea.

NEW YORK. Mar. 14 Colonel Ed
win F. Glenn, chief of staff of the
department of the " eastern United
States army, in an address tonight at
an ""army and navy" dinner given
by the Sphinx club, declared that
."the United States., army is pathetic
and all the other nations know it."
"We have been occupying the Mexi
can border 'for four years:" began
Colonel Glenn. "Two thirds -of our
army or 22,000 men have been there.
We have only 22.010 there, and 9,000 to
reinforce them. They are scattered
from the Texas border to the Pacific
coast.
"If it weren't pathetic, it would be
farcical laughable.
"Our army is like a fly gazed at
through the wrong end of a tele
scope. Until the European war came
you have shown as much interest in
our army as you would in a fly."
He said that the Spanish-American
war brought the United States forward
as a world power and therefore it
must accomplish the obligations of
'a world power.
J "We must have force," continued
; Colonel Glenn, "behind our nation;
we "must have force behind any note
our president may send or any ac-
tion he may take.
1 Reverting again to the Mexican
i situation he said:
"Some of us have had experience in
charging a man in his own country.
a man who has his own friends. I
' tell you it is not a matter of a day.
j It is a matter of months, maybe years.
I "We are told we are not going to
war, but to capture Villa. Let us look
at the reverse side. Suppose Mexico
announced she was going to send
5,000, 10,000 or 20,000 men into this
country? How long would we stand
for it?
"Do you think Mexico is going to
I stand for it? Would you respect her
if she did?
"I have made a study of the Mexi
can situation and I have figured that
if we are going into there to stabilize
the government, it will take five years
at a minimum, and from 400,000 to
500.000 men to do it properly."
PREMIER'S CONDITION

LONDON, March 14. The condition
of Premier Asquith, who is confined
to his room from bronchial catarrh,
was unchanged this morning, accord
ing to the official bulletin issued by
the attending physician. It was de
clared at the premier's residence that
the bronchial attack was not of great
severity.
1 The witness, said it was improbable
I that any great expedition against the
United States would start from either
I side of the Atlantic, but that some point
I in the West Indies probably would be
used as a base. He endorsed the navy
department's proposal to promote of
ficers by selection and not by senior
ity, .
Before the hearing today, Chairman
Padgett conferred with President Wil
son, who urged speeding up work on
the naval appropriation bill. The
chairman said he expected the hearings
to be conclued within two weeks.

' Republican A. P. Leased Wire
Washington, March 14. while
there were indications in official dis
patches from Mexico today that the
de facto government was making a su
preme effort to capture Villa and his
bandits with its own forces, there was
no sign that General Funston's orders
to proceed on the same errand had been
modified in any way.
Word that American troops had
crossed the border was still lacking, the
war department itself not having been
advised as to when Hie movement
would begin.
Congress took active notice of the
border situation today for the first
time. The house passed a joint reso
lution late in the day authorizing the
recruiting of the mobile army to full
strength. This means the addition of
approximately 20.000 fighting men to
the infantry, cavalry, and field artillery.
The senate is expected to concur to
morrow and the necessary orders will
be issued immediately to fill up regi
ments on border duty.
' This step was suggested by the army
general staff. It is urgently de
sired now because of the weakening of
the border force by the expedition af
ter Villa, but ever since the patrol of
the border began the army has been
greatly handicapped by the skeleton or
ganization of "regiments, companies,
troops and batteries. The force that oc
cupied Vera Cruz had similar difficul
ties, some of the companies there being
less than 40 men strong.
Secretary Baker conferred today with
Senator Chamberlain and Representa
tive Hay, chairman of the congression
al military committees and later Rep
resentative Hay returned to the war
department accompanied by Represen
tative Kahn, ranking republican mem
ber of the house committee. The reso
lution was introduced by Reperesenia
Uve Hay immediately upon his return
to the capitol. Its consideration was
expedited by the unanimous consent,
and its passage followed with only
Representative London, socialist, vot
ing against it.
At the state department steps were
taken to make it certain that distorted
versions of he American purpose in
sending armed forces across the border
were not given wide circulation in Mex
ico. By cable, telegraph, radio and mail
full statements of all that has trans
pired since the raid upon Columbus
and of the attitude of the United States
government and its reciprocal agree
ment with the Carranza government
went forward to consuls and state de
partment agents throughout the south
ern republic. The intention is to keep
these officials fully informed in order
that he can correct immediately and au
thoriatively any misstatements or ap
prehensions in their districts. Also they
will le able to advise Americans with
a full knowledge of the situation.
Tn effect, the United States has es
tablished a publicity bureau in Mexi
co to make clear its peaceful purposes
toward every resident of Mexico with
the exception of Villa and the bandits
who raided Columbus.
The situation along the border was
explained in detail to the cabinet today
by Secretary Baker. Troop disposi
tions so far as they are known to the
war department were indicated on mil
itary maps displayed in the cabinet
room. The secretary, it is understood,
outlined the natural difficulties which
General Pershing and his expedition
will have to overcome, the adverse cli
matic conditions, lack of water, great
streches of territory to be searched and
poor communication lines. The cabi
net also discussed the proposal to in
crease the army to full strength. The
president has power to do this by ex
ecutive order, but with congress in ses
sion it was deemed wiser that congress '
should act on its own motion.
The cabinet, considered also advices
from many parts of Mexico, all of an
assuring nature. There was no indica
tions among these of an anti-American
feeling because of the determina
tion to pursue and, capture or kill the
bandits. Later the state department
made public the following message from
its representative at Queretaro, where
the Carranza government is now lo
cated: "Reply of the United States to de
factor government's note of March 10,

said, stating that no person would be
allowed to remain who is not engaged
in business there or could give
a satisfactory reason for his presence.
Police patrols armed with rifles and
revolvers pace the streets night and
day and have orders to disperse crowds
and prohibit loitering. The refugees
asserted that several men had been
shot on the streets for n.)t moving as
quickly as the patrols thought desir
able. They also maintained that the
majoritv of the people of the town
were sympathetic with Villa. The
mines and smelters were said to be
working full force.
Half a million cartridges consigned
to General Culles were seized here to
night by United states soldiers. Two
hundred thousand arrived by freight,
and three hundred -thousand by ex

EL PASO, Tex., March 14.
Points near Columbus, N. M.,
where the American expeditionary
force is gathering, reported to
night that preparations were under
way indicating that part of the
American troops were in readi
ness to cross the border by to
morrow morning.
Through the thick veif of cen
sorship which has been estab
lished by General Funston, suf
ficient inforrr-ation leaked through
today to confirm the belief that
the advance guaid of the first
expeditionary force may start in
pursuit of Villa in 3 time to be
measured by hours. The main
force may not start for two or
three days.
While the border waited in keen
expectancy for word that United
States soldiers had crossed the
international line, reports flowed
in from Mexican sources to the
effect that Mexico's arch bandit
had alrerdy been surrounded by
the troops of Carranza. The "first
chief" was apparently making
strenuous efforts to anticipate the
Americans and was reported from
several sources to have concen
trated more than ten thousand
troops at different points about
Casas Gr&ndes region in Chihua
hua where Villa is supposed to be.
The officers of the Tenth cavalry
left here today for Columbus shortlv
after it was learned that the passage
of transport trains between here and
the scene' of the Villa raid had ceased.
They were practically the last of the
corps cf officers who were stationed
here. The stoppage of transport
trains was regarded as particularly
significant "as their movement hart
never ceased, night and day, since the
news of the Columbus raid was
flashed through the country. Their
stopping now is taken to mean that
the concentration of supplies at Co
lumbus, has been practically com
pleted. Edwin R. Spencer, a negro, arrived
hero tonight from Hachita, N. M and.
said he had been a captive of Villa's
men before their raid on Columbus
last week, lie said he escaped when
the retreat startd.
Spencer declared that before thu

ported at Alamo, some miles directly
south of Galeana.
Other reinforcements are now com

tierrez so that in a few days he will
have 18,000 fighters at his disposal.
Villa is believed to be making for the
mountains to the south, which he has
made his recuperative station during
most of his revolutionary activities. .
Staff officers and clerks around the
headquarters office in Juarez still take
a significant interest in reports about
the American troops crossing the bor
der. This is the first subject they
question the visitor from El Paso about.
A report received by General Gavira
from Corralitos today stated that five
Mexican ranchers, all members of one
iamily, had been murdered there by
Villa when he reached that town in his
flight from Columbus.
