I they were awaiting permission from
f : Carranza before doing so. Gaviern
; said he believed Carranza's reply

Despite the censorship, news of Im
portant military preparations all

1 all directions. By morning would be
I spectators of the movement were hur
rying to the international boundary
r and giving circumstantial statements

"My commander at Palomas, Gen
eral Bertani, informed the American
commander at ColumbuB, what atti
tude our first chief would he toward
American troops passing upon Mexi
1 : can soil. I am now awaiting reply.
1 But I feel sure that my instructions
will be favorable to a friendly co
il operation of the American and Mexi-
can troops against Villa."

cla, today, before whom this statc
V ment was made. Garcia said he
agreed with Gaviera's opinion.
f; Juarer Remains Calm.
t Rumors of the advance of the puni-
L tlvo force did not disturb the usual
M. lalm of Juarez today. The garrison
MC soldiers appeared entirely, friendly to
R visiting Americans, as was the native
flx population. Even the departure of
H? general Gutierrez. commahder-in-chiei
of the state of Chihuahua, In a spe
cial train for the south, occasioned
nothing but mild Interest. Tho gen
eral's train consisted of two passenger
coaches and of three box cars, which
were filled within and on top with
his armed escort. Gutierrez will per
sonally direct operations against Vil
la. Denies Popular Resentment.
Speaking of the rumors of popular
resentment against Americans in Mex
ico, Consul Gnrcla said:
"The excitement, so far as I am
able to learn, 1b entirely on the Amer
ican side of the border. I haven't
heard of a single authentic case of
Carranlsta soldiers threatening the
persons of Americans, Perhaps a
few individual soldiers have called
the Americans names, as has been
charged, but I myself have often been
called names on the American side.
Our forces are well under discipline
aud there is no likelihood of any out
rage against Americans of any sort."
Gaviera added:
"I know that there has been none
of tho reported resentment among
my men. We are all friendly dis
posed toward the United States and
her citizens."

FRENCH SURE OF I
FINAL SUCCESS I
Third Phase of Battle of Ver- H
dun Is Begun Weak Points H
in Line Strengthened. H
GERMAN INFANTRY H
Heaviest Fighting to West H
Fearful Execution Done by H
French. Fire Germans H
Gain Victory. H
Paris, March 15. The renewal of H
the fighting west of the Meuse, after H
three days' pause, Is regarded as Ifl
heralding the opening of the third Bfl
phase of the battle of Verdun. The J
defendeds have profited by the period H
of relative Inaction to strengthen fur- H
ther the weak points in their armor
and they await events with full con- H
fldence. IH
""Now I know where I stand. I am
certain of final success," said Genera) H
Pctain, who is in chargo of the
French operations at . Verdun, to BH
Messrs. Loralne and Pato, members
of the chamber of deputies who re- IS
turned to Paris yesterday from an in- J
spection of the supply arrangements J
at tho fortress and who declare them- IS
selves edified by all they saw. !
The first appearance of the German BBJ
infantry yesterday, after the usual in-
tenso bombardment occurred, at 4 BaH
o'clock In the afternoon and the fight- 1
ing lasted for three and a half hours. M
They attacked along the whole line
from Bethlncourt to the crest of H
Cumleres, a distance of about four M
miles. There was every indication, ac-
cording to latest advices, that the BBJ
struggle would be resumed during tho BJ
night. M
French Do Fearful Execution. H
The heaviest fighting was around H
Deadman hill, the Germans debouch- H
lng In masses from Corbeaux and. BBJ
other smaller woods to tho west. They H
were obliged to cross open ground jBBJ
and a well directed fire from the IH
French did fearful execution among !
them. Their ranks quickly filled up, IH
however, and although they were BBJ
stopped again they ended by getting jJ
a footing In advanced French trenches BBJ
at two points. H
Deadman hill is now being contend- BH
ed for. It is a fine artillery position iBbI
and nothing moro, tho military critics flH
say. It is a plateau whose base is BB
limited on its four faces by four IBbI
ravines and it rises reasonably at (BbI
the east, dominating there the present JBbI
Gorman positions. Tho crown prince's (bbI
plan Is evidently to make a breach ll
in the French line between Bethln- .BBJ
court and Deadman hill to enable bis jflflH
troops to advance in a southeasterly ifll
direction toward Chattancourt and en- JBH
velop tho French loft thero, whllo '
German forces from Regnovlllo and &
Cumleres try to turn tho French posl- BBB
tlons between Cumleres and Deadman
