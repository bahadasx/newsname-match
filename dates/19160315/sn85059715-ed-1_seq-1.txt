HACHITA, N. Mh March 15.?The
Second cavalry brigade under command
of Colonel (ieorge A. Dodd, completed
Wednesday preparations to
move forward from Culbcrtson's ranch
on the border south of here Into Mexico.
A qnlck movement was expected.
During the last few days supply
trains aided by wagons and trucks of
ranches have been forwarding large
supplies to the camp.

K'L PASO, March 16.?The wire from
Columbus, M M? where the first exliedltioa
1b in readiness for entering
Mexico, was working today but no
messages about the troops had been
[received since late last night. During
the early hours this morning the censorship
behind which every important
move at Columbus is being cloaked cut
off information front Columbus completely.
The point chosen for the entrance
for the punitive expedition is .at the
edge of a dreary desolate plain inhabited
prfncipaliy by coyotes and prairie
dogs, swept by sandstorms and denuded
of vegetation except the cactus and
a few other objectionable growths,
i For at least thirty miles the United
States troops must make their way
across this desert. They then reach
the lowest range of the Sierra Madre
mountains rising to a height of 3,000
to 3,500 feet, broken and twisted into
all manner of fantastic shapes by volcanic
actions and barren of any verdure
worthy of the name. LoDely halfcivilized
ranchmen are found here and
there In the valleys nursing their cattle
at the infrequent and scanty water
holes.
There are no roads of any kinds in
all this region. An ancient track
known as the "smugglers' trail" Is
used by such traffic as passes through.
The expeditionary force must carry
all Its own provisions and must in a
large measure rely on its base for
i water.
After fighting Its way ngahtsl nature,
assisted ly whatever guerilla troops
Villa may be able or care to muster
against them, about 125 miles through
this country the punitive expedition
will reach the Sierra Mudre proper,
a range of mountains rising from 8,000
to 10,000 feet. The region Is one of the
wildest, most barren and desolate
that It is possible to find anywhere In
the world. The mountains are split by
canyons some of wh'ch have a depth of
between 2.000 and 3,000 feet and there
Is not eveli a recognized trail through
their solitudes.
In the Casas Grandfcs section, however.
the country is thickly wooded
although devoid of vegetation which
could provide forage for horses or
food of any kind for men. Hero the
expedition would strike the. Casas
C.randcs river, which sweeps westward
and splits Into three, considerable
branches. By following one of the
branches the soldiers would be able
to obtain sufficient water but between
the streams the mountains rise in
great barriers presenting a country
