Some People Are Born To Worry
COUNTY SCHOOL
CONTESTS FOR
1916 ANNOUNCED
W. B. Stewart, County Superintend
ent of Schools, Makes Public
Contests.
TO TAKE PART IN STATE
AND COUNTY FAIRS
Cups and Other Prizes to Be Awarded
to Prize Winners Teachers
to Aid.
W. Stewart, county superin
tendent of schools, has announced
the contests to be given this year for
the students of Beltrami county
schools. Among the contests are
the acre yield of corn contest, the
Garden and Canning club contest,
the potato contest and the girls'
bread baking contest.
To Give Help.
The plan this year is to arrange
the industrial work to comply with
the requirements of the state indus
trial work for counties It is fur
ther planned to give more help to the
contestants by having the teachers
voluntarily assist boys and girls in
their contest work and report. The
five teachers ranking highest in the
service will be given five dollars each
and free admission to the county
fair They will assist at the fair.
Canning Contest New.
The only new project offered this
year is the Garden and Canning club
contest which was suggested last year
in the canning demonstration held
at the fair and in which five clubs
took part. Along with the growing
of the vegetables is the marketing
and canning of the crop. Nothing
in the contest may go to waste be
cause that which is not used in the
home or sold green is stored and
canned. The work of canning is
simple and gives a chance for social
times. It pays also.
Corn Contest Same.
The Acre Yield Corn Contest will
be the same as was held in the coun
ty for the past two or three years.
The amount of corn put in may be
from one to four acres.
The potato contest of last year has
been changed to comply with the
state contest and now includes an
eighth of an acre of ground.
The girls' bread making contest is
the same as in previous years except
that there will be a preliminary con
test to select a representative of the
county to the state contest. This
will be held July 12 in Bemidji. This
is the date also of the annual school
officers' meeting.
Besides prizes offered in this con
test many premiums are being given
for schoolroom work.
Applicants desiring to enter any
contest should write to Mr. Stewart.
