GERMANY ALL TAXES ASKED
Berlin, Germany, March IK. The
chief business of the relchstag when
It reassembled today was the discus
sion of the government's revenue bills.
It Is understood that the non-Socialist
parties are likely to act as a unit and
that the government will get substan
tially all the now taxes It has asked
for and posiibly more, as a section
of the relchstag favors a tax upon
extra war profits heavier than that
proposed bv the government.
A national convention of chambers
of commerce has adopted resolutions
favoring tne governments

measures, but protesting strongly
against anv increase In the tax on
war profits over that already sug
gested Some complaints are heard
outside the relchstag that the bills
aim to obtain the now revenue chiefly
from the non-farming classes, whereas
tho farmers are now prospering tn an
unprecedented manner. It Is probable,
however, that there will bo no serious
contest in the relchstag over any of
the government's bills.
