lanson Not Mayor Any More
An interesting aftermath of the recent
Vermont election is the fact that Mayor
Hanson of Bef'ast, Me., is out of a job,
ince the Maine election Monday, having
been defeated by the Republican candi-
ate. The Mayor's defeat followed a
spirited campaign, which ended Satur
day night, when his opponent held a
rally at the largest hall in the city, where
standing room in the hall and in the
street was at a premium. The principal
peaker at the rally was Rev. William
Sbaw of Montpelier, who recently met
the Mayor's arguments in Montpelier,
and some of the. rather effective
ammunition used by Mr. Shaw were the
catements made by Mr. Hanson in
M6ntpelier, especially the reading of the
formulas given by Hanson that be
