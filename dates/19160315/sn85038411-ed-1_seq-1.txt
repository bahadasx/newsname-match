Hachita, X. M„ March 15. The
Second Cavalry under command of
Col. George A. Dodd, completed to
day preparations to move forward
from Culberson's ranch on the border
south of here, into Mexico. A quick
movement was expected.
During the last few days supply
trains aided by wagons and trucks of
ranchers have been forwarding large
supplies to the camp. In order that
ihe columns' bases shall he in con
stant communication with each other
by wireless, a station has been erected
here by the signal corps.
The advancing columns are con
stantly to know the location of various
detachments and movements of supply
trains. The border camp is located
approximately three miles north of
the border at which point the troops,
arc planning to "ross. Large num
bers of men who know the interior;
of Chihuahua and Sonora have pre

While regiments of tTnited States cav- i
I airy, heavily supported by infantry, |
awaited General Pershing's order to- ,
j day to advance into Mexico, General i
• 'arranza's troops, according to in- j
j formation received here, worked des- j
perately to effect the capture of Villa
j in order to forestall an entrance into J
| Mexico by American forces.
Major-General Funston received re- !
I ports of increased activities of the j
: de facto government troops, but. there :
was no disposition at his headquarters i
to regard the activities as anything]
1 more than evidences of Carranaa's de- j
j termination to co-operate with the I
lUnited States in eliminating Villa.
General Funston remained in his
■ office until after midnight to receive
reports from General Pershing. Ameri-
I can troops would be across the bound
lary line early to-day, but General
Funston himself said he did not know '
of General Pershing's intentions.
Mis orders lo (he commander of the
punitive expedition were, in effect,
, "Move when you are ready."
j Orders issued for the suppression of
news that might interfere with the
i success of the expedition into Mexico
have served to keep the public in

troops that will be sent into Mexico
| under General Pershing.

Exploding Oil Stove
Causes Fire on Hill
An exploding oil stove in (he cellar
or the home of C. E. Griffey, 1331

and slight damage at 9 o'clock this
morning. Mr. Griffey had been doing
some work in the cellar and was using
a small oil stove to furnish light. For
some unknown cause the stove ex
ploded and scattered oil in all Uirec
, tions.
Mr. Griffey got several buckets and
| tried to conquer the 1 lames but alter
fighting them single-handed for about
: 20 minutes he decided to let the fire
i companies help him. A neighbor
sounded the alarm and soon after the
| blaze was subdued. Aside from tlie
| burning of window sashes in the cel
lar and some articles stored in the

however, filled the house and the resl
