PLAN YOUR GARDEN ON PAPER
Indoor Gardening Will Enable You
To Raise Two or Three Crops.
"Plan your back-yard garden on
paper in advance" is the advice of the
vegetable garden specialists of the U.
S. Department of Agriculture. A little
indoor gardening or thi3 sort will en
able you to have fresh vegetables
throughout the season and will make
the same ground, with little extra la-
linr nnrl PYnpnsi vIaIiI twn nr tlirea
two ; ,' three crops are grown instead
of one, a comparatively small garden
will supply the average family with
fresh vegetables all season. Moreover
such planning in advance will enable
j you to get the ground ready in time
for planting and to secure your seods
and plant them at the dates which
, give each variety its best growing con
ditions. For example, if you will
thus plan the plot to be devoted to
peas, by the time your first crop i3
harvested, the second crop will be in
bearing, and the plants of tho third
well advanced. '
All the tools that are necessary for
indoor gardening, which can he made
an interesting recreation for the
whole household, are a large Bheet of
wrapping paper, a ruler and a pencil.
After looking over the garden and se
lecting the plot of soil best suited for
your purpose, measure this and out
line it on paper on a scale of 1-4 or
1-8 inch to the foot.
"Next, study your garden bulletins or
books on horticulture and the seed
catalogues to determine what can bo
grown in your climate under the con
ditions of exposure, soil aud drainage
in jour back yard, 'ibis study may
lead you to plan ditches to improve
drainage, show you that your soli
needs finely sifted ashes to break up
its sticky character, or that you must
add rotten manure, dried blood, bone
meal, wood ashes, lime, or other for
tllisyrs to make it suitable for veget
able. In general, the aim of the back-yard
gardener shculd be to raise those veg
etables which nre either expensive or
in v. bich the flavor or quality depend
ini'portantly on absolute freshriesB

their
df-licute bloom and sweetness. Conso
quenlly as much space m possible
should be devoted to such vegetables,
and other vegetables in-which fresh
ness does not count eo importantly
should largely be used as fillers to
keep tho ground nt work. Effort also
should bo wade in a garden to have
special vegetables, such us okra, oi
which tho,famiy i3 fond and which
are difficult to obtain iu local markets
or are commonly high priced. The
Ihousewifo probably will want a little
bed of parsley, chives, or other herbs,
not because they are expensive to buy,
but because of the convenience of be
ing able to pick a sprig just when it is
needed.
The profit from gardening, however
comes net alone from the vegetable?
that are produced. The healthy out
door recreation nnd exercise and the
educational value of a garden in train
ing children manually, and in inculcat
ing in them habits of order and in
dustry must not be overlooked
Fathers and mothers will find that the
preliminary planning of a garden wli;
do much to arouse the interest of tin
young people and encourage them to
do their chare In cultivating and weed
ing it. This will be particularly true
if tho owner hires a laborer to do tin
first heavy disheartening drudgery,
but on a patch ready for the lighter
work of making the seed bed.
Having decided what is to be plant
ed the indoor gardener draws lines or
symbols on his outlined plan to indi
cato the different crops, inserting the
date when 'each is to be planted.
Where a second or third crop is to
follow the eame row or occupy tin
same ground, this may be written in
red' or blue, which indicates that it is
to be planted when an earlier crop is
over. In laying out the plan the own
er should consider tho amount of each
vegetable necessary for a serving for
his family. He also should bear ir.
mind the habits of the plants, so as In
allow space enough between the rowt
for their proper growth, for the inter
planting or later crops, and for easy
cultivation. The cultivation, o'
course, is easiest when the rows a
1 1-2 to 2 feet apart, as this permitt
the use of wheel cultivators. Plants
which make a high growth and canst
heavy shade naturally should not be
located where they will interfere with
sun-loving small plants. Perennials,
such as rhubarb and asparagus, whicl
are not cultivated, should not be growr
among plants which call for tilling
The planning may be extended also to
tho planting of small fruits, such a:
currants, raspberries, and grapes, an.-'
even to the location of apple or other
fruit trees.
A successful garden can ue had in n
city back yard 25x70 feet m dimen
sions. The plan also can be used in
laying out a plot of a larger yard . or
with changes in quantity planted, car
he adapted to small yards or plots of
other shapes.
Itows of low-growing, quick-maturing
.early vegetables should be plant
ed so that at proper intervals oetweer
them later-maturing sorts can lie dis
persed. The early plantings consists
of rows of radishes, early beets, let
tuce, carrots and a few parsnips, par
nips being placed so that tliey couU'
have the benefit of the entire growing
season, while between were placed
first rows of radishes and lettuce and
later bunch beans. The beers, later in
the season, may give way to a few
late' cabbage plants. An area should
be devoted to a dozen tomato plants
trained to a single stem on stakes

about 18 inches apar' in each direct

for maturity. It is necessary, how
ever, that the site for tomatoes thuuld
.)e as sunny as practicable. In the
least simpy 'portion of the yard early
and late peas may be planted together
with a rpw of sweet peas to supply
blossoms for the tablo.
Before tho tomatoes are planted,
onion sets occupy the area nnd are al
lowed to remain until large enough for
use or until it is necessary to thin
them In' certain areas to make space
i'0'r planting the tomatoes.
' The plan once made out should, of
course,1 be followed carefully through
out the season, especially with regard
to the dates for planting. Where it is
.lecessary to change a date this should
be indicated on the plan. The plan
ulao will serve a3 a convenient memo
randum sheet for keeping a fairly com
plete record of the garden. On it can
oo entered notes regarding success or
ailure of the different vegetables, nnd
whether too much or too little of any
variety was planted for the family
needs. Failures with certain veget
ables or seed, especially where the
plants showed any sign of root
diseases, should be noted carefully and
if possible the reasons for failure indi
cated. When the season is over thir,
iilan should be filed until the next
period lor indoor gardening comes
around. The wise gardener will study
the old plan carefully and rearrange
his vegetables so as not to grow the
same kind the second year in the
same part of the garden. Ho 'also
should be particularly careful to trans
ler to other parts of the garden, or
not to attempt to raise at all, those
vegetables which have suffered from
'ootknot or similar diseases. If this
notes are at all complete, they will
help him to look up subjects in ad
vance in bulletins, and also will show
him what vegetables are most worth
while and what hardly pay for the
time and trouble spent on them.

;
Trade at Home
The Bennington merchants in co
operation with tho Banner are to con
duct a "Trade at. Home" campaign.
This should be commended by all. We
understand it is with the double ob
ject of disc&urnging mail order busi
ness on the part of the public -and of
discouraging high prices on the part
of tho merchants, thus bringing about
an end desirable to all.
We would suggest a third object,
viz; to encourage buying supplies In
quantities. Tho merchant can sell
more cheaply in quantities, but the
great saving to the consumer is in
time. If for instance a family uses 100
cakes of soap per year think of tho
waste of time in buying each separate
ly. Sometimes a separate trip to the
store will be required, also time wait
ing to be served, etc. If it averages 5
minutes time to purchase and pay for
a cake, it will take 500 minutes, or
eight hours to purchase 100 cakes.
But the whole 100 cakes could have
been purchased In live minutes. It
would not be difficult to enumerate
fifty similar things which could be
purchased In six months' or a year's
quantity and thus' save many hours
during a year. The writer has for a
number of years purchased practical
ly all his household supplies in six
months' quantities and this has re
duced the time r.pent by Mrs. Bart'.ett
iu shopping to alaiost nothing, and has
enabled her to attend to her household
duties with ease Rud still have much
time left to give to community work.
The money saving has enabled us to
stand back of and contribute to num
erous community and social interests
in a way which otherwise would be im
possible to people of limited means.
The local stores exist primaiily to
serve the people, service, however,
brings its reward and financial gjfin
ensues. But here lies the danjfur;
there is a tendency for service to jfaso
'being. the object and for gain pi) bij
ceme the object, then the prices ri.
This tendency gave tlie ma.ij;.; ordr
Iiouac ppptrtuiU-.tp spring ui.' Whifh
merchant pvt the prices toj irigh peo
ple turned urthetn. They were clever
enough to "st-that In tho long run the
greatest,; profits come only by giving
the. rt"aiwi arirvice-i But ulns for 'the
local, merchant, with much i.,iof his
bu&uess diverted he must kee up to
hl.V Uiith schedule in order to make i
living profit.
Uhat is the solution? Just what itt
now proposed. A "Trade at home'
campaign, in which we all get togeth
er, in which prices all go down and
itay down, in which we all go to thq
local merchants and stay there.
Co-operative buying and mail order
houses are always uniueal. The most
ellk'ietit way to secure goods is
through local merchants. Tho former
aie sometimes made necessary when
the object of gain supercedes the ob
ject of service in local dealers.
Let us get together for service". (I
speak as A merchant.) Let us ' pur
chase strategically, let us manage ef
ficiently for the sake of our customers.
Let us see how low wo can keep our
prices, how high we can keep the quail
ty, how much we can give for fhe
money, how much good we can do our
community. Let us forget the profits
and Etrive to servo.
Let us get together for our com
munity. (I speak now as a customer).
Let us pay cash, let us purchase in
quantities, let us demand low prices,
(far better go to the mail order
houses than pay high prices, remem
bering that if we consent to pay exor
bitant prices we are injuring our
neighbor by forcing him to pay the
same), let us be on our guard against
poor goods at low prices from adver
tised firms iu cities, let U3 give our
merchants credit for good quality, ad
ditional convenience and lack of waste
and breakage when comparing their
prices with those of outside firms.
In short let us all get together, let
us forget what wo are to get out of it
and let us strive to serve. Let us see
how useful we can make, our busi
ness to the community, how small wc
can keep our personal wants and how
much we can have left to give to
every good and worthy object. Then
let all enjoy our community life to
gether. LECTURE BY DR. CAVERLY

CANADIANS IN RUSSIA
Had a Hard
Time Trying
to Build
Railroad.
New York, March 14. Pierre B
Lawrence, a French Canadian of
American citizenship, came back yes
terday from Northern Russia, and
told some of the difficulties which
have been encountered in constructing
the railroad from Kola, on the While
Sea, to hitch up with the Hue for Pet-
rograd, by which the Allies hope to
supplement the Archangel route for
munitions. When ho left there last
February there was 6till a gap cf
forty-seven miles left, he Baid, but it
was covered by a reindeer service, and
some of the supplies were getting
through.
"Last October," Mr. Lawrence said,
"advertisements appeared in inni
peg and other Canadian cities calling
for men used to railroad building in
cold countries.' An English company
backed them, and they got together
570 line, husky chaps, who had worked
ou the Grand Trunk Pacific, tho Cana
dian Northern, and tho Hudson Bay
Line. 1 was engaged as deck Super
intendent.
They brought us down here to Waa
hawkeu and took us aboard the Russian-American
liner Czar. We got to
Russia in twelve days, but then found
that we were not at Kola at all, but
at Siniieiionono, a mcro fishing village
which was shelled by the British dur
ing the Crimean War. The nearest
place was Kandalasha, but that was
twelve miles away. We got in in a
blinding snowstorm at the end of Octo
ber, and found it was about 10 degrees
above zero. They told us to be ready
to land next morning, and we began to
disembark at 2 o'clock in the morning.
"We got the machinery off although
there was nothing but a beach, and
we had to walk a quarter of a mile to
get off the sand.. The bosses came off
about 10 o'clock, and then suddenly
the steamer pulled out and left Arch
angel. We asked for food and found
all that had been landed was three
barrels of green apples, two hams and
one case of eggs. Think of that for
570 men. There was a rush for them,
and you can imagine tho jam as a let
of husky Irishmen and Scotchmen
started scrapping to get the "grub.
Some ot them were shoved ' (n the
water but wo got them out all right.
"When we asked the boss what to
do, he said. 'Make out the best you
can. Ilo told us there wa3 another
ship already two days overdue, and
she would have the provisions. Then
she didn't come, and they said she
had been torpedoed. It may bo so, I
cannot tell.
"We could get all the black bread
and tea we wanted from the Russians,
but there was no sucar. The Russians
would give you anything, only they
hadn't, anything. io give. .There, were
some huts near, and we pulled them
down and made shelters. .Then there
were seventeen horses and wo killed
five of them. . There were plenty of
turnips, carrots and cabbages brought
from the South. ., They were just lying
about on the beach, and we made stew
of those. So. we had to live for five
weeks. . Ju the end we f,ot reindoer.'
When at last a ship arrived, the first
thing she discharged was-: cases of
1 ctr. aud barrels cf rum, and - for a
time, at least, Mr. Lawrence said, the
construction gang seemed to have .for
gotten their troubles.
"One day," Mr. Lawrence went on,
"A Russian official, all covered with
medals, came along and said he repre
sented the Department of Rivers and
Harbors. He said, 'I suppose you can
give me accommodation for sixty-five
cf my stuff,' and we had only got
huts for our own men. The boss
said. 'The nerve of him!' and I told
him it as nearly as 1 could in French;
so he took his sixty-five aboard a Rus
sia ship and sailed for Archangel."
According to Mr. Lawrence there
was trouble again in February with
the Russian authorities about the pay.
and the construction gang were driven
by Russian soldiers aboard a ship.
But the British Admiral interfered and
forced tho Russian authorities to live
up to their agreement and give the
men a passage back to this country.
Altogether this expedition, Mr. Law
rence said, built seventeen miles of
track, but he bad a rough sketch show
ing the jam of vessels in the harbor
without docking facilities and piles of
freight on the beach.
