(By Associated Tress)
EL PASO, Texas. March 15.?The
wires from Columbiis. N. M.i ivhero
the first expedition is in readiness for
entering Mexico, were working today,
but no messages about troops liave
been "received since late last night.
During the eaily hours this morning,
tho censorship, behind which every Im
portant move at Columbus is being
cloaked, cut oft information from Col
umbus completely.
The point chosen for entrance for
the punative expedition, is at the edge
of a dreary, desolate plain inhabited
principally by coyotes and prairie
dogs, swept by sand storms and de
nuded of vegetation except the cactus
and a few other objectionable growths.
For at least 30 miles the United
States troops must make their way
across this desert. Then they reach
the lowest range of the Sierra Madra
mountains, rising to a height of from
3,000 to 3.500 feet, broken and twisted
Into all manner of fantastic shapes
by volcanic eruption and barren of any
verdure worthy of the name.
I.onely. half-civilized ranchmen are
found here and there In valleys, nurs
ing cattle at infrequent water boles
and subsisting almost ?entirely on beef.
There are no roads of any kind in
all this region. An ancient tract known
as the "SmuggJqrV .Tr?il" is used, by
such traffic as passes through. The 'ex
peditionary -force' must."carry all Its
own provisions' and must in ajarge
measure rely on Its base for water, r "
After ^ghting'rr^ay'agSJKSt'^nat'drfe"
assisted by .what dver guerilla .troops
Villi niay be able to. muster 'against
them, about 125 miles 'through this
couutry the punitive expedition will
reach the Sierra Madra proper, a range
of mountains rising from 3,000 to 10,
000 feet. The region is one of the wild
est. most barren and desolate that it
is possible to find anywhere in (he
?world. The/mountalns are split by
canyons, some of which have a depth
of between 2,000 and 3.000 feet, and
there is not even a recognized trail
through their solitudes.
In the Casas Grnndes section, how
ever; the country Is thickly wooded,
.although devoid of vegetation which
could provide forage for horses or food
of any kind for men. Here the expe
dition would strike the Casas Grandes
river, which sweeps westward anil
splits into three considerable branch
es. By following one of the branches
tho soldiers would be able to obtain
sufficient water, but between the
stream the mountains rise in ? great
barriers, presenting a country almost
inaccessible even to men on foot.

into the controversy of the last |
day or' two, but In his lecture last
night simply exercised the right
to expressed ills convictions. '
Although the weather was most In
clement, there was a orowded-house
at the Central Christian churcli last1
evening to hear Dr. Taylor's sermon
on "Amusements." Leading up to the
sermon there .was a most enthusiastic
song service. The big chorus under
Mr. Adams is doing splendid work.
Xr. Adams sang "Face to Face' in a
most beautiful and helpful way. Sun
day Mr. William Leigh, of Akron, Ohio,
one of the finest artists In the evan
gelistic Held, will bo here and take
a leading part In tho meetings.
Dr. Taylor on amusements said:
"Some people set standards whicli
they declare to the world shall he the
standards, whereby tho world shall bo
governed; they lay down laws and sots
of morals, Whicli they insist shall bo
observed, but in so doing they are
exceeding the authority of any liv
ing man. for it Is only the indivldvjii
who shall be competent "to say as to
what standards shall rule his life, or
that mode of morals ho shall consider
worthy of -being observed."
' Dr. Taylor In discussing the dance
pointed out many of Its harmful as
pects; but lie struck hardest at the
characterof the dances. He made
the statement "Many a young man
while dancing with a young lady, when
his mind was singing, with imiurity,
was not lit to keep company ?.-'fh her
in a -prayer meeting." - He ? further
said: "Good people dance, thousands
of them, and they art) just as good
after thoy have'danced as before. Bad,
people dance, thousands of them, but'
they were bad before they started' to
danco, and the dance was not respon
siblejfor It; .either. IThd dance as a
whole cannot-"be condemned'no'more
thanpeopIecan.be.'.' .. : ,
Dr. Taylor discussed the theatre at
some length. He branded a certain
side of theatrical' life "?.S a disgraced
but1 drew' the* same honest and dis
criminating -character here as .on the
dance and gambling. He said: "There
are plara which are some of the great
est heritages of the ages, and there are
others which are a disgrace, but It
rests with- tho individual which he
shall witness. Some of the world's
greatest men and women have been
connooted -with the theatre In the writ
ing of plays, In their presentation and
In their acting of them. Men such as
