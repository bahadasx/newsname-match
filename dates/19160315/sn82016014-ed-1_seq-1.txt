Even the departure of General Gutier

Speaking of the rumors of popular
resentment against Americans in Mex

"Tho excitement, so far as 1 am able
to learn is entirely on the American
side of the border. I haven't heard of
a single authentic case of Carrunzista

haps a few individual soldiers have
ca lied the Americans names, as has
been charged, but I. myself have often
heen called names on the American
side. Our forces are well under dis

any outrage against Americans of any
sort.

"I know that there has been none A

El Paso. March 1 5. The Amer

Contracts have been completed
between General Pershing for the

one of the richest cattlemen in
Chihuahua, by which fresh meat
is to be killed daily on demand of
the commissary department by

Similar contracts have been

Washington, March 15. Adminis

suit of Villa and his bandits. Secre- j

patches and reports from the border,
announced that no word had come
that troops were moving into Mexico.
officials were gratified today that
the American note, accepting General
Carranza's proposal for a reciprocal
agreement, whereby either his troops
or American troops may hunt down
the Villa bandits on either side of the
border, had been favorably received
at Queretaro. where the Carranza gov
ernment is located.
Statements setting forth all that has
taken place since the Columbus raid
and of the Washington governments
attitude and its reciprocal arrange
ment with the Carranza governments
were on their way today to American
representatives in Mexico. This step J
was taken to prevent distorted ver- ;
sions of the American purpose in send- j
ing armed forces across the border be- i
ing widely circulated in the southern I
republic. Officials hope thereby to
make plain the peaceful purpose of
the United States toward all Mexicans
except Villa and his bandits.
Re-assuring advices from Mexico
continue to reach the government.
These say that there have been no
demonstrations of ill feeling against
the United States because of the deter
mination to hunt down Villa outlaws.

today that the American expedition

With the report that 3.000 cavalry;

today gave the impression that no in-

it was believed, the infantry regiments
coming toward Mexico from interior 1
posts being used simply to patrol the ;
border.
With the strict censorship main- '
tained at Columbus on all mail and

Pershing will keep in touch by wire

FUNSTON SEES A
LONG, DIFFICULT
CAMPAIGN AHEAD
State Journal Given Interview
From General Himself.
He Says Unprepared Invasion
Would Have Been Folly.
VILLA IN A DESOLATE LAND
Troops Must Be Prepared for a
Hard Struggle.
General Pershing Has Orders
to Move When Ready.
San Antonio, Tex., March 15. "I
hope the American people appreciate
that this is going to be a hard and
very difficult campaign. It may be
a long one also."
This was the conclusion in which
Major General Frederick Funston, in
whose hands unreservedly has been
placed the task of capturing the Mexi-
can bandit "Pancho" Villa, summed
up the campaign today.
General Funston intimated that
General Pershing has his orders and
will move when ready.
"One of the best features of the
campaign is the fact that the troops
axe in splendid shape for the work.
From a physical standpoint they could
not be better. The time that most of
them have had on the border has
hardened and toughened them for the
character of the campaign they will
have to undergo. It is going to be a
hard job.
Villa's Strong-hold.
"Villa has fled to one of the natural
ly most desolate countries in the
world. What nature did not do for it
in this respect the fighting factions in
Mexico have done. Unless we go in
there sufficiently supplied with food
and fodder to take care of the prob
lem of subsistence entirely, we would
be defeated by the nature of the coun
try long before we met Villa's forces.
There - is nothing left in all that bar
ren region for us to buy or take. Our
; prisoners, taken in the Columbus raid.
ten tKa, villa and his men are liv
ing upon jerked beef. They have no
other food supply of consequence.
"I believe that our aeroplanes are
going to be of great value to us in
routing work in tihs campaign. It
will be the first time we have ever
used our planes under war conditions
I and I have great hopes of their suc-
cess.
( ause of Deia y.
"I hope that the American people
understand the reason for the appar
ent delay in crossing the border and
starting the chase. It would hav
been sheer folly for us to continue the
chase the day of the Columbus raid
We had about 250 men against Villa's
1.500 and possibly more. Our men
; had no supplies with them. They
might have continued a running fight
a.d killed a few more Villistas, but
unless they could have actually cap
i tured Villa, no particular military ad
; vance would have been gained. The
! fast that Villa's forces so greatly
outnumbered ours made pursuit dan
j gerous. Had our troops been sur
: rounded, as easily might have been
i done, another Custer massacre would
bave resulted,
j "From what I have learned, I be
1 lieve tnat Villa made the raid as the
result of one of his characteristic
j 'brain storms."
"These fits of blind, unreasoning
anger of his are well known and,
I while in them he will do anything.
! Back of all of this was the hope, I
; presume, that intervention might re
i suit in swinging the tide of popular
Mexican favor his way and bringing xo
him large bodies of Mexicans and so
become a serious factor in Mexican af
fairs again."

he would press for an early hearing.
The resolution recites that the sec
retary of the interior for the year
1915 shows that there was an increase
in the production of 6.985,000 barrels
of crude petroleum over the year 1914
and that the price paid by refiners or
oil companies was from 20 to 30 per
cent lower than in the year 1914, and
that notwithstanding this tremendous
increase in production and large de
creases in price paid by oil companies,
the price of gasoline has within the
last nine months increased from 1 00
to 200 per cent.
The report of the secretary of the
interior shows that the exports are
only 22 per cent of the increased nro-
duction for the year 1915, ;he resolu-

REPLY IS TERSE
England Asserts Right to Seize
American Mails.
Answer to Protest a Flat
fusal to Stop Practice.
Ke-
Washington, March 1 .". Ambassa
dor Page at London, it was learned to
day, has cabled to the state depart
ment sufficient information concern
ing the forthcoming reply to the
American protest on the British seiz-
f uro
mails to indicate that the i
United State? is soon to face a serious
crisis with Great Britain. The answer
:s understood to ne practically a cm
rejection of all the American conten- j
tions and is officially reported as be-
ing "unsatisfactory."
There are now three acute issues
Wttn (ireat Britain. They are:
The imn,
First Seizure of American
mails on the high seas.
Second Invasion of American j
ships on the high seas to take off j
persons either of or suspected of l
being of German origin.
Third The validity of the Eng
lish blockade which embraces her
extension of the contrahand list
and her "enemy origin" decree.
The underlying principle of the ;
American protest is that Great Brit
ain not only has violated international
law by her acts but has also violated
, the plain letter of Xhe Hague conven
ty I tion. Great Britain has replied arbi- j
j tartly that she has jurisdiction in her i
; own territorial waters, which of ficials j
! say means that she can commit any
I International violation within her
jurisdiction.
