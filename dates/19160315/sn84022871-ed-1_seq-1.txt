FOR LOCAL BASEBALL
Each season there is considerable
baseball agitation in town and almost
all of us are ready to admit that a
base ball team in the village is a real
factor toward town growth and pros
perity. We have had several ball
teams that, while a credit to the town,
were too expensive to maintain, that
is they cost a few men in subscription
more than could easily be borne, but
even before the advent of the profes
sional ball team in Barton the town
maintained a very creditable team and
won its percentge of the local games in
fact for many years we have been
known up and down the line as being
a base ball town and in the past two
years, when there has been ho local
team, we have furnished material to
other towns, which has helped them
win games.
Why can't Barton have a local base
ball team? There is only one answer
to the question. It can have, if local
talent are interested in the sport and
do not consider a matter of dollars and
cents. It is hardly to be expected
our young men who naturally are
working, will give their time to base
ball exclusively, but on the other hand,
most of our local talent can be in
duced to play by simply paying for
their lost time, a matter of perhaps $2
per game and it is reasonable to hope
hat the townspeople may come for
ward with a subscription, not several
hundred dollars, and not in lumps of
$5. $10 and $25, but there are presum
ably a number of townsmen who will
subscribe from $1 to $5, or the main'
tfnance of a purely local team. The
idea advanced this season is by far the
best one for some years, and that is to
form a small league with Irasburg,
Orleans, Newport, Lyndonville, and
Derby Line, with others like North
Troy and St. Johnsbury and make all
players in order to be eligible to the
teams, residents of the towns in which
they play. It would certainly give us
several good ball games during the
season and we should not be out
classed by these teams, neither should
we be any better than the others.
Surely these days must be lazy days
indeed if we cannot get a crowd of
local fans to attend games at the fair
grounds. There are a hundred auto
mobiles in town and vicinity, but even
if you have to walk over there, it
probably would be just about the sort
of medicine, you would pay your
doctor a dollar or more to prescribe.
Save the dollar and pay it in at the
admission gate. If you are not much
interested in the great National game,
it's time that you were and it's a big
lot better than fighting the Germans.
We can mention the names of sever
al young fellows here, who can play
snappy ball and who are willing to play
for a very small sum per game, just a
case of pay us for a lost day and yon
can't honestly do anything for the
same amount of money that will keep
the town on the map.like having a local
team, not a paid bunch of professionals
but town and school boys. Well,
what's the answer?
