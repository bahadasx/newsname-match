reason of a superior 'court ., decision
today, legal responsibility for the
widely discussed automobile accident
which resulted in the death of: John

gence was responsible for DeMaxtino's

Siemon, has gaine'd much notoriety
because) f this accident. There was
scandal in the police board when it
was charged that efforts had been
made to keep the affair quiet and
when Siemon had a hearing before
Coroner .Phelan that official found
him., guilty of negligence. When an
application was made to State's At
torney Cummings to have a bench
warrant sworn out ror lemon's fo
rest the state's attorney took the. mat
ter under consideration.. Then he an
nounced that' there was not enough
evidence, to warrant prosecution-. -
The statute uDon which Jurte-n cs
-re hia decision today makes no pro
vision tor a case in which a participant
in a collision conceals his identity. It
simply states that an action of this
kind must be filed with on one year of
the time the accident happened.
It was disclosed, in the sensational
revelations following the discovery
that it was Siemon's car that killed
DeMartino, that Siemon, , concealing
his identity, sent through his lawyers
to Mrs. DeMartino $ 1,000. This
was a check from his lawyers, which
Mrs. DeMartino used. A receipt for
this money was given by Mrs. DeMar
tino, but she did not waive her rights
by its acceptance. At" the time she
received the money, the identity oi
Siemon was 'kept 'from her. Antonio-Abriola,
then a deputy sheriff,
conducted the negotiations with tha
widow.

cesco Minnito of 753 Pembroke street
is the man who shot him Monday
night. He said Minnito attempted to
rob him. After he had been shot he
said a friend of Minnito, whom he
does not know, came along and cut
him with a razor. This is substantially
the same story he told the police.

DOUBLE LIFE OF
TROLLEY VICTIM
Contest For Compensation
- Between Women Who
Claim To Be Widows.
AFFIDAVITS FILED
WITH BUCKINGHAM
Triangle in Career of Shaw
Causes Queer Complica
tion In Court.
When Compensation Commissioner
E.J T. Buckingham opened the hearing
on ; the case of Walter M. Shaw, the
Connecticut Co. conductor who was
killed several -weeks" ago when, caught
between two cars, he found that two
widows were claiming damages under
the Workmen's act.
Sally Elizabeth Hobbs of Norfolk,
Va, says she is the widow of Conduc
tor Shaw and affidavits have been
made to prove it. Rosalind Stevens
.Howlett of Providence, R. I., says she
is the widow too, and ber attorney has
presented statements to 3 rove it.
Attorney M. J. Murphy of Provi
dence, represents the Rhode Island
widow and Attorney Clarence E. Hall
of this city has the case of the Norl
folk widow.' . Attorney Murphy pre
pared his client's claims to damages,
unaware that - there-, was any other,
and Attorney Hall did likewise.
, The hearing was -called for March 8
in-the office, of Commissioner Bucking
ham. Attorneys Murphy and Hall ap
peared,' each representing a widow.
Then it was learned, that there were
two widows. ' '
The Providence widow with her
brother, Russell B. Stevens, were at
the hearing. ' The widow testified that
she never heard of the, Norfolk claim
ant. She appeared surprised at the
turn of events. Attorneys Murphy and
Hall were undoubtedly surprised. Only
the testimony of the Providence
widow's side was taken and the hear
ing adjourned until March ' 16 for a
further investigation. :
Since then Attorney ' Hall, the com
pensation court , records indicate, has
been seeking facts on the history of
Mr. Shaw. It has been .learned that
affidavits . have come into .his posses
sion, sworn to by the Norfolk widow's
.father, and stating that on Sept. 9,
1908, at Elizabeth City, N. C, Sally
Elizabeth Hobbs was married to 'Wal
ter M. Shaw. The father declares in
the affidavit that his daughter claimed
the body and that both he and his
daughter identified it as that of the
man who had married into the Hobbs
family.
Registrar I. J. W. Munden of Eliz
abeth City has sent documents -to this"
city which purport to prove the mar
riage. '
The affidavit of the Hubbs woman
set . forth that she had her husband
arrested for' non-support. She alleged
too. great familiarity with a woman to
whom she. 'referred as "I.osa Hewlett."
Her husband : left her after that, the
assertion is. She was left with three
children, two of whom, aged seven and
four, .are living.
The sworn . statement of the Provi
denec claimant is that she was mar
ried to Walter Shaw in Elizabeth City,
N. C, July 5, 1912. She swore she
never heard of the Norfolk woman.
The latter, however, expressed the be
lief that "Rosa Hewlett"-and Rosalind
Stevens Howlett are the ' same, and
she says shewrote her many notes,
asking" her to remem Vir that Shaw
was married to herself.
A peculiar feature of the case is that
trolleymen, impressed by the pathetic
circumstances of Shaw's death, have
announced a benefit dance to be held
netx week for the Providence widow.
They hadn't heard of the Norfolk
claims. .'
The hearing is called for tomorrow,
but it is likely that it will be again
continued to allow the reception of
more evidence.
Shaw was killed at Ksb Creek. He
was standing at the rear of his car
changing the trolley pole, when an
other car crashed into him. He was
mangled and he died soon afterward.
Coroner Phelan exonerated the crew
of criminal- liability.
Charge Jitneur With
Stealing Fare's Furs
i
Benjamin Pomerantz, a jitney driv
er of 1230 State street, is locked up
at the police headquarters on the
charge of stealing a set of furs valued
at J 300 from Miss Marguerite Stu-r-ges
of Sport Hill. About a week ago
Pomerantz drove Miss Sturges to hei
home at Sport Hill. - Miss Sturges
did not have any money to pay the
jitney, man and -went to the house to
get some. She left her furs in the
car. When she returned the furs
were gone. , The theft was reported
to the police. Motorcycle Policeman
Clifford Gorgas-was sent to New York
today and located the furs in a pawn
shop. - They were returned to the
owner.

After a charge to the jury, lasting
one hour and five minutes. Judge
James H. Webb of the Criminal Su
perior court ordered the jury in the
murder trial of :jason Smith Haines
to retire. This was at 2:09, this after
noon. ..
In his charges to the jury, Judge
Webb dwelt t especially upon the in
sanity defence of Haines. He said
that in his own mind there was little
doubt but that Haines was the person
who did the fatal shooting. Then he
went, at length, into the part that the
insanity defence must have in the var

Crowds of well dressed men and
women not the average morbid cur

der trials await the verdict of the
jury in the case of Jason S. Haines,
the Trumbull farmer who killed his
wife, Anna, on the morning of Sept.
27, at their country homestead on the
Chestnut Hill road.
The curious element which has
been in constant attendance at the
earlier days of the trial have been
gradually replaced by lawyers, physi
cians, merchants and even society
women who have taken keen interest
in the battle of alienists and experts
in gun-shots. r
From an early hour this morning
every inch of the spectators' gallery,
the interior of the railing' and even
the prisoners' pen has been occupied
with scores willing to stand in any

corridors. The wives of all the coun

day's session.
Neither Jason Haines, Jr., his
brother, Willie Haines, or the Waller
family came to the court-room today

first few days when it was necessary
for them to. testify, the impression
was such that the prisoner asked they
be kept away. '
