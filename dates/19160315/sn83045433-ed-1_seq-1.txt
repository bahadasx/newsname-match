Above Battle's Smoke
atsaal ChMs to The Washington Herald.
Paris, March 14.-Above the
Verdun cauldron aviators of
both armies fought death duels
hour after hour today. The
midnight report says that three
German machines were shot
(lown by French fliers north
of Verdun, while in the Cernay
region another was sent hurt
ling to the ground.
The Berlin report states that
Lieut. Boelke, the noted flyer,
shot down two French ma
chines on the eastern front of
Verdun, while- two British aero
planes also were forced to the
ground.
While Verdun is the cockpit
of the fighting, and the decisive
struggle will be fought out
there, the entire front from the
sea to Lorraine today pre
sented the picture of a tremen

eStimates submitted to the House of
Commons today by Under-secretary for
War Tennant.
Mr. Tennant stated that the provision
of aeroplanes was now satisfactory and
even ahead of the supply of engines and
pilots.
The under-secretary for-war dwelt at
length, In his address to commons, on
the qtrtion of enlistnents and it supply
of men. lie stated that tfie govern
ment and the minister of Munitions were
considering especially the question of
single men entering munitions factories
to escape military serice.
The difficulties experienced in keeping
the recruiting at a high mark were ex
plained at length by the speaker. Where,
at the beginning of the war, he said
men concealed their physical defects in
order to enlist, it now is the habit to
feign defects in order to escape service.
Mr Tennant paid a striking tribute to
the discipline of the men, considering
their short training.
Refering to prisoners of war, the under
secretary announced that there are now
ninetten concentration camps in the
United Kindgom against seventy-two in
Germany. Five German ministers, he said
have been appointed to guard the spiritual
welfare and watch out for interests of
German prisoners of war.

New York, March 14.-Col.
Edwin F. Glen, U. S. A., chief
of staff of the Department of
the East, which is commanded
by Gen. Leonard Wood, to
night gave out a sensational
analysis of the military situa
tion of the United States with
regard to Mexico.
He characterized the system
of enlistment as idiotic.
"We have been occupying
the frontier of Mexico and
Texas for four years. We have
got two-thirds of the army of
the United States on that
border scattered from Browns
ville to Los Angeles. In other
words:
"We have about z2,ooo
American soldiers on the fron
tier. And you have a little
over 9,ooo United States troops
to re-enforce this body of men
scattered from Brownsville to
the Pacific Ocean. If it was
not pathetic, it would he fzrci
cal. It would be laughable.
"The cold fact is that the
Amncrican army of today is the
most pathetic thing any nation
ever knew or contemplated,
and other nations know it very
well."
