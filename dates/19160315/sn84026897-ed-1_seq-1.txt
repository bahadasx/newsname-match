Mrs. Lucy Keesee died on Snn
??day at ll:30 o'clock, at tho home
of her son, Dr. P. N. Keesee, and
in her death all have felt saddened
that" this sweet christian woman, a
mother in Israel, had passed away
She was 73 years of age. Mrs. Kee
see was a native of Virginia, hav
* ing come herc a few years ago to
make her home with her son and
during this time she has endeared
herself to all who knew her. For
years she had been in frail health
and during her residence here was
seldom able to go bevond the home.
Her life was centered in those
around her, her very presence being
a benediction. Her chief character
istic was self-forgetfulness and for
titude, and the gracious influence
^ of such a life will continue like a
ministering spirit. She enjoyed a
tender and beautiful affection by
her family and she was well worthy
of the love and honor bestowed up
on her. She was a saintly christian,
a member of the Presbyterian
.church. The interment took place
here on Monday afternoon at 3:30
o'clock at Mt. of Olives cemetery,
by Rev. E. C. Bailey. Three chil
dren are left to mourn her, Mrs. J
Smith and Mrs. J. W. Mish of
Virginia and Dr. P. N. Keesee,
Mrs. Mish having been here with
her mother for about three months.
Mr. David Ouzts of Rock Hill
is spending a few days here with
the home people.
The high school has elected Miss
Annie Stokes and Mr. JchnC.
Watson as declaimers on Field Day(
at Edgefield. |
The past week was observed by
> the women of the Baptist church I
as a season of prayer for h..me
missions and a special thank offer
.fc-^-lOif was given. Five meetings' were
held and each one was sweet and
spiritual and uplifting to all who
attended. Each program lasted an
hour and was filied with good
things, talks, readings, special
prayers and song messages. There
are about 50 meraber8 in the socie
ty, Mrs. Lucia Latimer being presi
dent and she has served in this ca
pacity most faithfully and well for
2b' years. The leaders for these
meetings were Mesdames W. J.
Hatcher, O. D. Black, W. S. Mob
ley, J. A. Lott and P. N. Lott. At
the first meetiug there were present
Mrs. Mamie N. Tillman, president
western division W. M. U., and
Mrs. Alvin Etheredge, superintend
ent of Ridge association and both
of these made excellent talks. Mrs.
Pendleton Jones brought greetings
from the Edgefield missionary so
ciety. It was a sincere pleasure to
all to have these interested workers
present When the envelopes were
gathered in a splendid offering was
the result.
Mr. Auburn Moyer has returned
to Washington, D. C., after a visit
to his home people here.
Mrs. Warren Paul of Edgefield
spent last Monday here with her
mother, Mrs. George Hubbard, who
has been sick.
Mrs. J. W. Stirnen was the guest
of relatives and friends at Edgefield
last week.
Mrs. R. A. Griffin of Augusta
and Miss Mamie Stansell of Green
ville. have been guests of Mrs. Wm.
Lee Coleman.
It is a source of regret to all to
learn that Mrs. M. E. Walker has
pneumonia, a trained nurse having
been called in to attend her. Her
symptoms are favorable and it is
hoped that ber illness will not be
of so long a duration.
Mrs. Walter Hendrix of Lees
ville spent the latter part of the
week here with her aunt, Mrs. J.
M. Turner.
The woman's society of Rose
Spring church (colored) was much
stirred up last ?week when they
found out that the $300 which rep
resented three years' effort on their
part to raise, had been spent by
their joint-treasurers, Emanuel
Jackson and Gus Clark. They were
making the money to remodel their
church. The way they learned of
the appropriation of the funds, ?vas
by one of the organizations wishing
to borrow from them and upon go

Joe Grant Convicted of Murder
and Given Death Sentence.
The largest crowd ever seen in
the Edgefield court room assembled
Thursday to witness the trial of Joe
Grant, who killed Jesse T. Durst in
the town of Johnston in April
1906. About four-fifths of those in
attendance were white people.
The unusual interest in the case
was aroused through the publicity
eiven Grant during the stubborn
fight which he made in the courts
of Pennsylvania resisting being
brought back to South Carolina for
trial. Through his attorneys he
fought the requisition of the gov
ernor of South Carolina upon the
ground that he would not receive a
fair trial and that he would be
violently dealt with.
Notwithstanding the conge?ted
condition of the court roora the or
der was perfect. The state estab
lished the killing of Mr. Durst by
Grant through two eye witnesses,
one a white man and the other a
negro. Several other witnesses also
testified for the state. George W.
Nickerson, who at the time of the
homicide was a boy 14 years of age
and resided in Johnsen, being now
a resident of Columbia, testified
that he saw Grant in charge of the
policeman and Mr. Durst near
Giant's barber shop and that Grant
pulled loose from the men, fired two
shots at Durst and ran. The negro,
who was also an eye witness, testi
fied as did Mr. Nickerson.
Mr. Durst died within three days
from the effects of the wound,
j Joe Grant and two other witness
es testified in his behalf. He stated
that Mr. Durst and his brother
came to his barber shop and de
manded the payment of a debt and
that they thrust him out of the shop,
threw him down on the sidewalk
and in the struggle he fired bis
pistol at random in order to extri
cate himself. He at once made his
escape, believing bis life to be in
danger. Gr ant went first to Augus
ta for a week and thence to Wash
ington, D. C., for three weeks, go
ing finally to Philadelphia where he
has been for the past nine years.
Both sides completed the evi
dence Thursday afternoon and Fri
day morning four arguments were
made to the jury, the solicitor and
N. G. Evans speaking for the state
and S. McG. Sirakius and S. M.
Smith for the defendant. Judge
Moore charged the jury as to the law
bearing upon murder and the jury
retired to the room about two
o'clock, returning a verdict of guil
ty of murder in the first degree
about 3:30 o'clock.
The counsel for the defense gave
motion for a new trial but this was
overruled b.: the court, the death
penalty being fixed by Judge Moore.
Friday, April 14, was fixed for the
electrocution of Grant, which will
be the 10th anniversary of the
homicide.
Late Friday afternoon Sheriff
Swearingen and Deputy Sheriff
Branson carried Joe Grant to Co
lumbia in an 'automobile, placing
him in the penitentiary. While en
route to Columbia he talked freely
with the officerii. He stated several
times and to different persons that
he preferred the electric chair to
being sentenced to life imprison
ment at hard labor. He also stated
that he will not appeal to the su
preme court but accept the verdict
of the lower court as final.
Joe Giant had lil2 on his person
when be was carried to Columbia
and he gave that to Sheriff Swear
ingen with the request that it be
seul to his wife in Philadelphia.
Howard Chandler Christy, illus
trator,, was walking down the street
when he was overtaken by a dog
that began to snap at his heels. Its
mistress made no effort to call it off,
so he turned and gave the dog an
admonitory kick.
"Brute! cried the woman, to kick
a little defenseless animal! That
little ere nure is a pet and is not
accustomed to such treatment."
"I beg your pardon, madam,"
replied Mr. Christy. I did not mean
to hurt your dog. But you should
have called him off."
"He would not have hurt you,
replied the woman in a grieved tone.
He is a pet."
"I did not care to be bitten by
him, nevertheless, madam, returned
Mr. Christy. I am somewhat of a
favorite at home myself."
HARDY'S HAPPENINGS.
Many Visitors Come and go.
Bridges Need Attention.
Families are Moving
Away.
Sunday was a lovely day but real
cold all day.
Mrs. Dr. R. L. McKie carried a
car full of her children and Mrs.'
Julia Townes to Augusta to attend
the musical concert of Senor Ando
negui.
Mr. Drew Mealing took bis fami
ly to Corryton Sunday afternoon to
visit his father aud sisters.
Mr. and Mrs. George Townes
and baby visited her parents. Mr.
and Mrs. E. J. Barker of Curryton,
also Mr. and Mrs. Milton Barker
and Mrs. Luta Bay non and Miss
Lilla Bunch were visitors at Mr.
Evan Barker's Sunday.
Mr. and Mrs. Milton Barker,
Mrs. George Medlock, Mr. Martiu
Medlock and Mrs. Frances Townes
attended services at Sweetwater
Sunday.
We were glad to hear Mrs. Julia
Hammond of Augusta has improv
ed sufficiently for her sister, Mrs
John Mundy, to leave her and go
home Saturday last.
We visited Mrs. Hammond the
Sunday before and was glad to find
her up. We met our friend Mrs.
Adjie Tirnmerman at Mrs. Ham
monds' as well as Mrs. Mundy. Wt
are always so glad to see these la
dies and Sallie Hammond, so pretty
and jolljT,also Miss Lucile Burkhal
ter, another sweet young lady.
Mr. and Mead Hammond and
baby visited Mr. and Mr?. Harry
Bunch.
Mr. Henry Medlock and Henry
J.j spent the week in Edgefield.
Mr. Medlock was on the jury.
Mr. Geo. Medlock, Mr. Henry
Cooper and Mr. Herbert Bunch
went over Stevens creek Wednesday
and found the mud too deep and
sticky tor Mr. Coopers machine.
The rain on Tuesday made plenti
ful. The roads are pretty bad so
many holes that are deep and large.
There are 3 or 4 bridges in a
dangerous condition with some of
the boards broken and gone, leav
ing large holes which might be the
cause of a broken foot or leg of an
animal and that might cost the
county more than the repairing of
them would. We are jealous over
this sid? after hearing so much
about what grand work has been
done on the old Plank road. There
[are very few cars that risk trying
to travel this way now. I wish we
could have such beautiful roads as
Richmond county Georgia. They
are so wide, and straight aud so
beautifully graded and drained.
Mr. Will Briggs and family have
been so sick with chills they have
decided to move this week down
near Belvedere on Mr. James
Adams' place. We hope they may
improve and get over the malaria.
Mr. Ivy DeLanghter has been
very ill lor the past two weeks witb
dulls and has been taken to North
Augusta to his sister's, Mrs. James
Adams, where Dr. Walden can see
him each day.

|3EED CORN SELECTION.
County Demonstration Agen
Lott Gives Method of Test
ing Seed Corn. Other
Good Advice.
The system of turning pea stubb!
in jibe fall of the year is not th
most economical for two reasons
Fi^t turning pea roots, bringini
th^tn near the surface, in decompo
siti?n of the nodules the nitrogei
jesowjpesand goes back to its nat
ural element the air. 2. The shat
tered grain would make a wintei
cov$r crop, keeping down erosior
and^producing green organic mat
ter ?jfhich when turned would in iti
decomposition form a gas tba
would nnlock the latent potash tha
soili?ontains. All soils have potash
unavailable from 15 to 35 tons pei
acre seven inches deep. If the far
mef..>. feels he must break his pe?
stuople in the fall of the year or gel
delayed in his plantings, by al
meajjs cover the land with some
grain, rye, wheat or oats to disc
aodj?jtnrn in the spring.
In soil preparation the disc bar
row^ one of the most importan)
tool&to use. Every aore of land
the ^farmer expects tu plant he
shotted apply the disc (cutaway]
harrow first. A thorough mulch ol
the surface is equal to a coat of ma
nure.
Seed Corn Testing.
When a farmer plants his corn
without testing the germination
qualities, he is guessing and if he
fail?||n his crop he will lay all the
blame on the seasons while his
guessing was the cause. Test don't
guesj?> One ot the simplest ways is
to make a box 36x24 inches 4 inches
deep,*fill box 3 inches with wet saw
dustji?se warm water, firmly pack
sawdust, use a brick, take 2 yards
bldftohing, mark into 2 inch squares,
number the squares, select your
com, ?ag ears to correspond with
uurrvJ?7-s on checks, tack cloth. ;tO
boi ?t each end to hold in place, us?
the extra attached yard of cloth to
cover corn after you have taken 6
grains from each ear, two from each
end, two from middle on opposite
sides, but not off same rows, be
ginning with number one and so on
io last check. After spreding the
extra yard of bleaching with some
kiud of thick cloth, old piece of
quilt or guano sa^ks and spread on
the corn, put in some place where
corn will not chill, your cook roora
is a good place, don't allow it to be
disturbed in four or five days. No
tice too if the cloth has dried out,
if so wet in warra water. In about
ten das s you can see the kind of
corn you should plant. Testing is
about the only guarantee you have
of a crop, when you guess you have
none. With the assurance that
your seed is ali right your hopes
should be higher. It is a small job
compared to its importance. After
you have enough tested seed to
plaut your crop, save ten ears for
your breeding patch
This system was the means of
saving the northwest from bank
ruptcy a few years back. The corn
growers of that section found that
corn would vary from ten to forty
bushels to the acre. The same rule
will apply to our corn growing,
test and breed your corn to a higher
standard. With the ten ears plant
ten rows, one ear to row. This
plat you will have to drop by hand
to get as nearly as possible the same
number of stalks on each row.
Not necessary for any better soil or
extra attention, but we insist that
you give it a fair showing by leav
ing the fodder, don't ruin it by
bleeding the stalk at the critical
period of its maturity. When corn
is dry gather aud weigh corn on
each row separately, save the
heaviest for best seed.
As we write we are wondering
how many farmers in Edgetield
county are going to put our sugges
tions into operation. Well we have
already counted them. Our Edge
field people are not by any means
scrubs, but there are some charac
teristics among our farmers that we
cannot understand. For years I
have talked and begged for a re
spective number of boys for the
corn and pig clubs, it is beyond me
why the fathers of these bright boys
don't want them known outside the
front gate. It is just as important
for the boy to know practical agri
culture and stock raising as it is
mathematics, history, geography,
grammar or any other study. Af
Use Powdered Borax For Fly
Prevention.
Clemson College-A pint of pre
vention in the form of powdered
borax is better than a hundred fly
swatters when the aim is to relieve
the world of as large a number of
houseflies as possible. Experiments
made by the federal bureau of en
tomology established the value of
powdered borax in fly prevention,
and Clemson college advises the
people of this state to use it.
Horse and cow manures are the
principal breeding places of flies
and the fisrht on the horse fly
should begin there. To every eight
bushels of manure apply a heaping
pint measure of two cupfuls of or
dinary commercial borax, especial
ly about the outer edges of the pile,
using a flour sifter or any fine sieve.
Sprinkle two or three gallons of
water over the manure when it has
been treated.
This borax treatment should be
given to fresh manure, immediately
after its removal from the stable.
Flies lay their eggs in fresh ma
nure. When the borax comes in
contact with the eggs, it prevents
them from batching. The maggots
congregate at the outer edges of a
manure pile, so that most of the
borax should be applied there,
These directions apply especially
to horse manure, but the investi
gators advise the same treatment for
fly eggs and maggots in other ma
nures aud also suggest applying
powdered borax to garbage and
other refdse. Water should be add
ed after borax is applied.
Every house, especially every
farm house, should have screened
doors and window.?. The use of the
fly trap is another good measure.
But trying to prevent flies with
screens and traps it is pointed out,
is like potting buckets of water un
der the holen to catch the water
when a roof is leaking. The only
effective method of ridding a place
of flies is to cut them off at the
source, which will in most cases "be
found to be the manure pile.
Price Advancing.
Prices on practically all agricul
tural implement are advancing by
leaps and bounds. Messrs. .Stewart
& Kernaghan announce m their ad
vertisement that very soon a con
siderable advance will be added to
the price of binders and mowers.
However on all orders placed now
they will make the old price, sub
ject to countermand and too the
implements will not have to be paid
furuniil they are needed. What
better offer could farmers ask? Bet
ter see tnese popular hardware mer- j
chants at once.
Appreciated Kindness.

convicted of murder in the first de

jailer, his gold watt h and chain, as

kind treatment which he received
while incarcerated here.
ter all, it is not what vie know, but
what we can do. We want twenty
boys in the corn and pig club, and
we hope the fathers of these boys
will keep us in this work. We ho^e
some time this fall to have a dis
play of what our boys and girls can
do. We hope to hold these meet
ings at several school houses in dif
ferent communities. We will have
judges to judge the corn, the pigs,
the girls' needle work, canning,
poultry &c.
We hope to hear from every in
terested man aud woman in the
county on this very important sub
ject.
P. N. Lott.
P. S. The variation in the germi
nation of your corn is very apt to
surprise you unless your corn is of
a high type, well developed and
sound. You are liable to find some
ears you thought sound, perfectly
dead, just swelled a little, others
with short roots and long sprouts,
some with long roots and short
sprouts. Neither of the above will
do to plant. Your short roots and
long sprouts will make a big stalk
with no corn, long roots and short
sprouts will produce a dwarf stalk
with a nubbin, roots and sprouts
almost the same length is the kind
lt will make corn and if everything
is fovorable a record crop. "
