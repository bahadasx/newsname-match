El Paso, March 15.
United States troops,
with camps broken were
under marching equip

border west of here at
daylight today in at least
two positions. Military
censors prohibited trans

Up to a late hour in the forenoon

Consul from
AmericaHas
Quit Mexico
Torreon, Mexico, March 15. The
American consul, A. L. Williams, has,
on the advice of his government as
well as his own judgment, turned
over the American consulate at Tor
reon to the British vice consul.
Meantime a party of more than 40
Americans are 'gathered here waiting
to leave on the train which has been
held for a day by a wreck on the Mon
terey road.
The farranza officials still main
tain, in spite of general fears, that the
Americans are perfectly safe. "We are
gentlemen and Americans have no
need to fear as we will escort them
over the border," said General Fran
cisco Gonzales today.
"We are certainly not seeking
trouble with the United States."
The newspapers in this vicinity had
published the notes exchanged by the
Carranza and Wilson governments
and telegrams explaining the object
of the punitive expedition, comment
ing editorially that they do not un
derstand why a breach of relations
between the two countries should be
thought imminent.
Torreon is quiet and conditions nor
mal. '
Washington, March 15 State de
partment officials are puzzled by the
departure of Consul Williams from
Torreon. They have given him no in
structions to leave and have no re
ports of any disorders in that reg
ion, still they realize that the consul
must have some good reason for leav
ing. They are reluctant to believe that
the consulate is in danger.
REICHSTAG DUE
TO REASSEMBLE
German Parliament Scheduled to
Discuss Government Bevenue
Bill Tomorrow.
Berlin, March 14, (via London,
March 15, 10:45 a. m.) The chief
business of the reichstag when it re
assembles tomorrow will be the dis
cussion of the government's rev
enue bill3. It is understood that the
non-socialist parties are likely to act
as a unit and that the government
will get substantially all the new tax
es it has asked for and possibly even
more, as a section of the reichstag fav
ors a tax upon extra war profits
heavier than that proposed by the gov
ernment. A national convention of the cham
bers of commerce has adopted a reso
lution favoring the government's rev
enue measures but protesting strong
ly against any increase in the tax on
war profits over that already sug
gested. Some complaints are heard
outside the reichstag that the bills
aim to obtain the new revenue chiefly
from the non-farming classes, where
as the farmers are now prospering in
an unprecedented manner. It is prob
able, however, that there will be no
serious contest in the reichstag over
any of the government's revenue bills.

Americans Concentrated at

Pershing's Order.
San Antonio, Texas, March 15.
While the United States cavalry and
infantry forces today awaited General
Pershing's order to advance, General
Carranza's troops, according to infor
mation received here, worked desper
ately to capture Villa In order to fore
stall any entrance into Mexico by
American troops. From official and
unofficial sources, General Funston.
received reports of Increased activ
ities of the de facto government troops
but there was no disposition at his
headquarters to regard the activities
as anything more than evidence of
Carranza's determination to cooperate
with the United States in eliminating
Villa. It has been reported here this
morning that the American troops
would bo across the boundary line but
General Funston had received no ad
vices and said he did not know Gen
eral Pershing's intentions.
Funston's orders to the commander
of the punitive expedition were in ef
fect "move when you are ready."
Everything in Readiness.
Little in the way of preparation waa
left undone last night but there was a
feeling at army-headquarter hero
that General Pershing might wish to
delay his advance until practically
every possibility of a hitch in his
plans had been eliminated.
The general orders that have been
issued for the suppression of all news
that might interfere with the success
of the contemplated expedition into
Mexico served to keep the public in
ignorance of the exact number of
troops that will be sent in under Gen
eral Pershing, but is generally known
that the orce will bp not less thaa
5,000 and that the greater part of the
available troops in the United States
will be within reach if it should be
come necessary to use them. The con
centration of men and supplies is vir
tually completed.
EIGHTY-CENT GAS IS
GAINED AT CAPITAL
Springfield, III., March 15. The
public utilities commission of Illi
nois handed down a decision today
lowering the gas rate of Springfield
from $1 per thousand cubic feet to 80
cents. The decision is the result of
the largest rate making procedure be
fore the commission in the two years
of its existence.
The decision is expected to affect
all other Illinois towns which are
fighting for lower gas rates, and is
said to be a forerunner of a decision
in the Jacksonville, III., gas rate case
which has been pending for some time.
The Springfield case, affecting
60,000 people, was begun soon after
the commission was appointed. The
hearings lasted nearly two years. Over
four thousands pages of testimony
were taken by the commission repor
ters; 24 separate hearings consumed
62 days time, were held. The final
hearing took place Nov. 6, 1915. Com
plaint was filed in January, 1914.
The 20 per cent reduction was de
cided upon after the commission had
fixed the value of the gas company's
plant, for rate making purposes, to be
JS00.000.
