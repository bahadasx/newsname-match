Peons are Expected to Flock to Villa Just as
Soon as U. S. Troops Get Started
After the Bandit.
[United Press Leased Wire Service.]
EL PASO, Texas, March 15.—An
ironclad censorship that even refuses
confirmation or denial of a report that
Hachita, N. M., was captured by Car
ranza troops, gave rise to the belief
today that the American expedition
after Villa was about to move.
Brigadier General J. J. Pershing's
orders fere to cross into Mexico
when he was ready. Americans ar
riving at Deming, N. M., from Colum
bus, stated that the expedition would
begin the bandit hunt early today.
With the report that 3,000 cavalry
under Pershing will make up the
"flying" column to chase Villa, army
men today gave the impression that
.no infantry will be used in the' ex
pedition. It was believed the infan
try regiments coming toward Mexico
from interior posts will be used to
patrol the border.
From the strict censorship main
tained at Columbus on all mail and
express matter, as well as telephone
and telegraph, it was plain that the
troops will be in Mexico many hours
before the "war correspondents" will
be allowed to send details of the
movement.
Pershing will keep in touch by
wireless with Major General Fun
ston, directing the campaign from
San Antonio. It was expected that
the advance guard will dash for Guz
man, Mex., and establish the first
base of operations against Villa.
At the latest reports early today
Villa was near the oalena district
moving toward the American Mormon
colonies.
General Luis Guiterrez was due to
leave Juarez today for Chihuahua
City personally to lead the Carran
zista pursuit of the outlaw. His
earlier statement that he had 6,000
men on Villa's heels already was
now revised to 1,000 either in or en
route to the Galena district to begin
the pursuit.
Carranzlstas have not given up
hope that their military activity to
ward capturing Villa will prevent or
at least postpone the American ex
pedition. Gutierrez stated he hoped
to run down the bandit leader in ten
days.
United States army men were not!
so confident. They estimated it
might be months before the American
expedition ran him down.
A spirit almost of pessimism was
reported from Columbus where the
main division to take up the Villa I
hunt was being outfitted.
Preparations for the campaign were
going forward on a large scale.
Trainloads of provisions and equip
ment have been moving through EI
Paso from eastern points for Colum
bus during the past twenty-four hours.
Plans even have been made for sup

Border raids west of El Paso were
reported again. Small bands of Vil

American train east of El Paso was
fired on by Carranza sympathizers.
The attitude of Carranza officers was
reported to be more threatening, fol
lowing the failure of General Gutier
rez to get General Pershing to con
sent to a postponement of the Ameri
can expedition.
Mexican newspapers printed in El
Paso became so belligerent in their
tone that they were suppressed by
the police.

publication, was closed up when it
ran off an extra edition featuring the
threat that the Mexican eagle would

censored dispatches received today.
Several small detachments of infantry
broke camp there last night and left

LONDON, March 15. German
troops have driven a wedge In the
French front between Bethincourt and
Dead Man Hill, according to Berlin
dispatches, transmitted through Am
sterdam today.
Bethincourt, Berlin asserted, is
nearly two-thirds surrounded and a
slight German advance will force its
evacuation. The French positions on
Dead Man Hill, according to the Ger
man report, have again been put in
peril in the resumption of the Ver
dun fighting.
Tho German claims are contradicted
in the latest official dispatches from
Paris. The French war o31ce admits
the Germans are making heavy at
tacks on this sector, following an in
tense bombardment, but claims the
tepulse of all German attacks except
at two points between Bethincourt
and Dead Man Hill.
There is every indication that the
German assaults on this front, mark
tho beginning of a great battle that
may prove the last phase of the great
struggle for Verdun. The crown
prince, it is now believed here, hopes
by one brilliant stroke to break' the
French front, northwest of the citadel.
This movement. If successful, would
trap the French army on the east
bank of the Meuse and mean the sur
render of enormous supplies of artil
lery and munitions and probably a
large number of prisoners.
That French experts are awake to
the danger of such a blow is evident

northwest of Verdun. French military
experts and staff officers conclude
that the battle for which the Germans
have been preparing will rage with
the greatest fury between Bethincourt
and Goose Hill.
"If the Germans force those French
positions, their next point of attack
will be the Bourrus forest, two and
one-half miies northwest of Verdun
and Charny, three miles north of Ver
dun. Were the Germans to break
through to Vordun by way of Douau
mont and Vaux, on the east bank of
the Meuse, it would be an empty vic
tory. They would lose 300,000 more
men for the sake of an empty husk.
"Success, on the opposite side of
the riveV, via Gtoose Hill and Bethin
court, might be much more substan
tial. French forces are holding the
Lorraine front on the east side of the
river. All their heavy guns and ma
terial would run the risk of being cut
off and encircled, as the main bridges
spanning the Meuse would be com
manded by Germans.
"The French staff is fully aware of
the intentions of the enemy. The pre
cautions taken by General Petain are
a guarantee against surprise. The
German divisions may be expected to
hurl themselves in solid masses
against the heights of Dead Man Hl}i
and Goose Hill. The French officers
are convinced that they will, as on the
other bank, be brought to a standstill."

The present censorship Is the most

The telegraph was then In Its child

was too stale to be of value to the
enemy. During the Spanish war there
was a degree of news censorship, but
the policy was not so rigorous as to

too far away to make news a menace

Senate Adopted Resolution This Afternoon
After Debate Over the Whole Pre
paredness Program.
Is Most Rigid in Country's History for Almost
Nothing About the Campaign is Given
Out Officially.
OUnlted Press Leased Wire Service]
WASHINGTON, March 16.—The
senate this afternoon adopted the Hay
Chamberlaln resolution for immediate
Increase in the regular army to 100,
000 men.
The only fight on the measuro was
by Hoke Smith, who proposed an
amendment that the men be enlisted
for two years, instead of the usual
four. He announced himself opposed
to long term enlistments and said In
the present Instance he was sure men
could ibe obtained more easily If they
oould be assured they would not be
taken from civil life too long.
But 'before the resolution could be
adopted, the senate enjoined limited
debate. In a long discussion, the
whole preparedness program was
talked over, despite plans by Senator
Chamberlain for Immediate action.
The debate was cut off when I/eader
Galllnger demanded the ayes and
noes. The vote was unanimous.
General Pershing is now in control
of all channels of communication
from Columbus. He has taken charge
of the telegraph and telephone lines
and roads are guarded to see that no
dispatches are carried out by messen
gers without first being vised by the
army censor.
Under present arrangements only
four correspondents, representing
pre-Rs associations will be permitted
to accompany the army into Mexico.
They are subject to army regulations
and must be provided with full Held
equipment, including olive drab garb—
the same color as the field uniform of
the troops. The correspondents will
be designated by a white arm band
bearing the letter "C" In red.
All dispatches must be submitted
to the army censor. The army prob
ably will string telegraph llneB Into
Mexico as it advances, but only such
messages as pass will be handled.
I?ven private letters mnst be submit
ted to the censor before being sent out.
Photographs also come under control
of the censor. Professional photo

barred. Correspondents may carry

sible extermination of the remnants
of the eight thousand.
With eight thousand men on the
offensive, the lessons of the Euro
pean war indicate less than 3,000 of
tho enemy could successfully check
them. An offensive force has to be
three times as strong as tne defend
ers of the trans-Atlantic entrench
ments if there Is to be any hope of
success. This applies to straight
fighting on comparatively level battle
areas.
The conditions of warfare in north
ern Mexico, however, are unierent
from those prevailing along the Euro
pean fronts, except in the Vosges and
along tho Austro-Italian frontier. The
mountainous region of Mexico sug
gests problems in offensive strategy
similar to those which the European
combatants in the Vosges mountains
and the Austro-Italian Alps have not
yet solved. Eight thousand soldiers
in the Vosges or the ^ips would be
very strong if they were on the de
fensive but should they attempt to
take the offensive, it Is probable they
could be brought to a standstill by
no more than two thousand of the
enemy if the latter were properly
equipped.

Crux occupation, but even that was
nothing like the Stygian darkness pro

Members of the general staff today
pointed out that far greater oars was
to be taken under present conditions
than If the United States and Mexico
were at war. In tnat event the Unit
ed States could control all means of
communication into Mexico, 'ihe
present being merely a bandit chase,
so to speak, commercial wires into
the southern republic cannot be Inter
fered with. Any message Villa's
agents in the United States want to
send to him must be sent through
unless of course they are obviously
improper.
There Is no censorship on dls-,^:,
patches sent from any point that IS
not included In the zone from which
the expeditions into Mexico start and
from those sections in Mexico through
which American troops are advancing.
Correspondents can send messages
without regard for the censorship
from any other point along the bor
der or from interior points in Mexico.
For instance, correspondents In Mex
ico City may send dispatches that will
not be interfered with by the army
censors provided they do not enter
the United States through a point
which has been taken over by the U.
S. military, either as a supply basis'
or as an entering port.
