Grand Jury Report. \
Following is the report of the
Grand Jury submitted to the
presiding judge at the term of
criminal court held at Chesterfield
last week:
To His Honor S. W. G. Shipp,
Presiding Judge:
The Grand Jury having passed
on all bills and other matters
submitted to it by the Court, beg
to make the following report:
We recomend that the proper
authorities take what steps they
deem best for the care of the
family of Tim Teal, who is in
the asylum and whose family is y
in a destitute condition. I
We have had the books of the s
county officers examined and J
have had report made up. How- y
ever, this audit is not complete
from an accounting standpoint ,
on account of executions in the j
Sheriffs hands that have not i
been proven valid assets.
The reasons for passing the
above executions for the credit t
of the treasurer in this condition ,
are: First, he states that a check 1
against his receipts would not :
show the facts, on account of I
the receipts being issued and not |
paid, he having kept no record
of these unpaid receipts or mark- 1
ed the duplicates canceled. Second,
as there has no cash book
been kept, and the duplicate receipts
being carbon copied and
badly blurred from handling
would make a checking extremely
difficult, if possible, consequently
they were ordered pass
ea, to De proven by the sheriff's
efforts to collect, and this audit
to be resumed and concluded at
that time.
We recommend that the sheriff
with any necessary assistance. 1
proceed at once to collect these
executions and report the same
at the next term of court.
We further recommend that 1
each officer handling funds of I
the county or trust funds as i
county officials, keep such books 1
:ii t-1 _ .1 -
as win enaDie inem to make I
trial balance each month and 1
that trial balance be taken off
monthly. s
We also recommend: That 1
each officer receiving fees and i
commissions open an account in 1
books, of fees and commissions <
reseeved, and keep a true and j
accurate account of same. This i
is necessary as the law requires <
it, and specifies that should this i
amount exceed three thousand 1
dollars thf? amr?nnt nwur tKran
thousand dollais goes to the s
county, a report of the same to 1
be made to the Supervisor. Un- i
der these conditions we do not i
think it proper for officials to rebate
their fees and instruct that
they do not do so.
We also recommend as next j
improvements that vaults be r
built for the treasurer and auditor,
also for the sheriff and su- t
pervisor, which will necessitate f
the building of two vaults. We
also recommend that toilets be j
put in, as the sewerage has al
ready been completed. a
We recommend that the ac- a
countant be paid the six hundred
dollars due him to date, seven s
hundred having been paid him, p
the total amount of this audit e
having cost $1,300. a
We wish to thank the presiding
judge and other officers of j
the Court for the courtesies ex- t|
tended and beg to be excused
from further duties at this terra
of court, all of which we respect- v
fully submit, Verv truly,

The raid on American terri
lory proved costly to the bandit
chieftain. The bodies of 18
bandits, including Pablo Lopez, <
second in command, had been 1
gathered and burned before noon
and troopers reported an undetermined
number of dead still lying
in the brush. Led to the at
tack under the slogan, "Death
to the Americans," Villa's followers
fought with desperation.
Just before dawn they crept
along ditches skirting the United
Stated cavalry camp and rushed
the sleeping town, firing heavily.
Washington, March 10.?American
troops were ordered across

President Wilson to take Francisco
Villa and his bandits dpaH

General Funston, who ended the
Philippine insurrection by taking

American columns are expected
to be moving into Mexico before

to meet about 3,000 guerilla
troops in a mountainous region
from which Carranza troops
tiave fled.

Griggs Writes About Mica Mine
Plumtree, N. C??March. 9.
Doubtless some of my friends
will be pleased to read an ac
count of some of the things I
observed on my outing today.
1 left the Dormitory here
about half past one o'clock, accompanied
by a number of the
faculty, to visit the, "old English
Mine" It is located only one and
a half miles from here up the
mountain side, but while the distance
is not so great still one
would think it quite a distance
on account of the mountain being
so steep.
Upon reaching the entrance
we went to the manager, who
was exceedingly kind to us, by
allowing us to go through this
magnificent piece of work of
man. It extends about 1000
feet back under ground, there
being about a dozen different
tunnels almost all of which produce
Mica, it being the leading
Mica mine known anywhere.
While there are hundreds of
mines even in the western part
of N. C. still this one produces
about one-thirteenth of the mica
produced in the world.
The mine is through solid
rock from the very entrance, and
is conceded to be the safest mine
anywhere, and an accident has
not happened in this mine in
more than a decade. The present
owners have worked it continually
tor more than ten years
and in all it has been producing
for thirty-five years or more.
The output being an average of
one hundred pounds a day, valued
at twenty cents a pound; of
course this is a very conservative
*ate of its production and
ihe price, as giJod grades of
Mica sell for from four to seven
dollars per pound when it is
finished and prepared for market.
Now one would think that the
company realizes good profits,
but the minning right of all this
section was bought several years
ago by some northern capitalists,
and a booty of one-eighth goes
to these men.
Now a word more in regard
to my thrilling experience, as
you know under ground life, and
work is quite rare to one from
grand old South Carolina, especially
one such as I, but I expect
that there might be others, perhaps
readers of the Journal, who
might feel as I did under ground
some 100<> ft?pecular. But de
spite this I enjoyed the trip to
the fullest.

Stevenson for Rural Credits
Mr. Stevenson, in his race for
congress, advocates a rurai credit
system. In the South, threefourths
of the people are farmers.
The great banking law put
through by this administration
made some provision for farmers
but none for the man who has to
t)UV his lanH ntul lr?n.r
credit on it. Six months is the
ongest credit he can get under
that law. There should have
tieen a land credit system em:>raced
in it whereby a man
:ould get a long credit and low
ate of interest on real estate
ind enable him to buy, or re- <
ieem a home. Why was it not
massed with the balance of the
>ill?

Americans Must Stay out Unless
* They Grant Him A
Similar Right
Mexico Citv, March 12.?General
Carranza tonight issued a
manifesto to the Nation declaring
that under no circumstances
would the Mexican Government
grant the right to the United
States to violate Mexican
territory by sending in an armed
force in pursuit of Villa without
consent and the reciprocal privilege
being first obtained and admitted.
Word was sent to the
confidential agent of the Mexi/.on
? ? "
v-ul uwciuiucia 111 wasningion
to make immediate representations
to this effect.
General Carranza says in his
manifesto:
"I am sure that I interpret in
this matter the National sentiment
and that the Mexican people
will comply in a dignified
manner with their duty be the
sacrifices what they may, to sustain
their rights and sovereignty
if, unfortunately, this drags us into
a war?a war which the United
States can never justify.
We will not be responsible for
the disastrous consequences.
Upon the heads of the traitorous
Mexicans who within and without
this country have labored to
produce this result, will fall the
inexorable justice of the people."

Monroe Enquirer
Mr. A. M. Crowell gives the
following interesting account of
the great forest fire which swept
over this country March f> 1855.
"Sixty-one years ago today it
looked like the world was on
fire. The wind was terrible,
blowing at the rate of sixty miles
an hour. It wa& a clear-day-but
there" was no sunshine on ac
count of the dense smoke which
covered the earth. In South
Carolina men going and coming
from market, cut their horses
loose from the wagons, mounted
the horses and barely escaped
with their lives. . Col. W. W.
1 ' 1
naiaup a iui^c resilience in
Jackson township burned that
day. Miles and miles of fencing
was destroyed, and at that time
the fields were fenced and the
farmers had to cut timber, split
rails and build fences before
crops were planted. A dwelling
in the eastern part of Union
county was surrounded by
broom straw and it looked like
there was no chance to save the
house and its inmates so fiercelp
was the dry straw burning. Two
men on horseback huried to the
house. One said to the other,
'What can we do to save the
family?' The reply was, 'We can
pray." The men got down off
of their horses and knelt in prayer
and the wind suddenly chang
ed and the house >vas saved.
"The firebrands would be carried
half a mile by the gale and
kindle in the drv grass and take
a new start. It was a day of terror,
sixty one years ago today
was.
"Rabbits, opossums, foxes,
deei, birds and insects were destroyed
in great numbers and
there were very few birds and
wild animals in ihe fields and
forests during the summer of
1855 and there were very few in
sects of any kind that year."
Owing to fog a steamer stopped
at the mouth of a river. An
old lady became very nervous
and inquired of the captain the
noiioo /\f
L,utmv v/ lliv MClilJ'i
"Can't see up the river," re- j
plied the officer.
"But, captain, I can see the
stars over head," she argued.
"Yes," said he grufflv, "but until
the boilers burst we ain't a-!
loing that way."
Union County Has Four Possible
Congressman
Monroe, March 12.? The com
ing congressional primary is
running a close race with the
Mexican situation as the chiel
topic of discussion in the Spit
and Argy Club, which is holding
meetings throughout the day
and part of the night. Monroe
people are at loss to understand
Mr. Page's action. If Mr. Page
could have taken an accurate
poll of the district, he would
have found a great many right
with him on the matter of warn
ing Americans. Even R. F.
Beasley, who bitterly opposed
the Congressman at the last primary,
made the following statement
on his resignation:
"Candor compels me to say
that I admire Mr. Page's determination
to vole his convictions
in the late tumult in Congress."
While the other counties in
the district are rushing out their
favorite sons, old Union is laying
low. It is the consensus of
opinion, however, that one of
Union's sons must have that
Congressman's job, and she'll
have her candidate out in due
time. While Mr. Beasley is being
urged to run, both by Union
County citizens and others, he
has not yet made any announcement
as to his course. R. B.
Kedwine is also mentioned for
the job, and so is Frank Armfield.
Some people are of the
opinion that if Attorne}' lohn C.
Sikes would come out for the
nomination he could get in in a
walk.
Unless Union puts out one of
her favorite sons, it is thought
that practically the entire vote
will revert to Lee Robinson out
of n neighborly nrtt.Mr to-.yp^u^
Anson.
The Fulfilled Wish.
A boarding school lad wrote
to an uncle for financial aid and
then, feeling a bit shaky about
the impression his letter would
make, added the following postscript:
"P.S. Dear Uncle; I am so a?i
1 . _ i -i i '
Miitiiieu iu nave asaeu you ior
this money that I have run after
the postman a long way to tret
this letter back, hut am unable
to catch him. My only wish
now is that you will never get
this letter.
"Your Loving Nephew."
The uncle replied by return
mail;
"My dear Nephew; I am hastening
to make you happy by
telling you that your wish was
granted. I never received your
letter.
"Your Loving Uncle.',
