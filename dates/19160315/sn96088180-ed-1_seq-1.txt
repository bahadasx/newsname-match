THE MEXICAN FRONT
El Paso, Mar. 15. Military cen
sorshlp has been thrown so closely
around Columbus and the border
country today that it is impossible to
ascertain troop' movements, although
many firmly, believed the American
expedition had started.
Control of the telegraph and tele
phone was taken over by a squad of
soldiers acting under orders from
General Pershing. A long distance
telephone call to Columbus merely
brought a reply from "central" that
Bbe was under military censorship as
well as everybody else there.
A censored Columbus dispatch from
a United Press staff correspondent
told. of preparations to establish a
base of operations for the pursuit.
Railroad switches and bridges are be
ing built by army engineers. Troop
movements were not mentioned in
the message.
Tne censor permitted mention,
however, of the arrival of the aero
squadron from San Antonio, with Us
consort of motor lorries. The Cnited
Press correspondent's message was
timed 9:30 a. m. today, but it does
not necessarily contradict rumors of
a start having been made, because
I newspapermen were not expected to
oe permuted to enter Mexico with
the vanguard. '
Officers at Fort Bliss refused to dis
cuss rumors that the border already
had been crossed.
The El Paso ft Southwestern rail
way telegraph department's state
ments that Vllllstas had looted a tew
houses on the outskirts of Hachlta,
N. M., apparently disposed of the
Btory that a Carranslsta force had
seised the town. . .
It was announced .that Palomas
had been evacuated by the Carran
slstas and that 1,000 of them were
marching toward Gusman. They are
led by General (Bertanl, according to
a statement from General Gutlerrex,
and will join the constitutionalists
hunting Francisco Villa.
Mexican Consul Garcla's statement
that 400 de facto government soldiers
remained to garrison Palomas seemed
to give the lie to rumors that Ameri
can forces already had crossed the
border, unless the de facto troops
have definitely decided to co-oporate.
