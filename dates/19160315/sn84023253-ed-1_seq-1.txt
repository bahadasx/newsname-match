FIRE AT ESTABROOKS
Upper Floor of Block on Railroad
Street Badly Gutted Monday
Night.
One ring from Box 43 at 11:40 Mon
day night called out the Chemical and
Hose truck at the Central Fire Station
for a fire discovered in the top floor
of Henry Estabrooks block on Rail
road street and before it was quenched
the rooms on that floor were badly
gutted and the rest of the building
damaged somewhat by water. The
loss is probably in the vicinity of
$2,000 and the total insurance on the
block and stock was $8,500.
The firemen were handicapped
somewhat by the box from which the
alarm was started going out of com
mission after it had struck 43 once.
But the chemical was early on the
scene and with the assistance of four
other firemen got two lines of hose
quickly laid. The fire was pouring
out of the windows when the firemen
got there and it required good work
to save the building. As soon as the
first firemen got the hose to working
they rang an alarm frm box 47 which
called out all the firemen and It was
two hours before the fire was subdued.
Evidently the fire started in a closet
in the tenement occupied by George
McFarland and wife and the other
tenement on that floor was occupied
by Mr .and Mrs. Albert Greenwood.
They both lost heavily on their furni
ture, especially the McFarlands. The
second floor was occupied by Mrs.
Pauline Ward and Mrs. Burrows.
Their furniture was damaged by water
and smoke.
After the fire was extinguished
Henry Estabrooks opened a box of
cigars for the firemen, Mr. Sheldon
served them coffee and the Cross Bak
ery furnished them doughnuts.
FORGER CAUGHT
Young Man Who Passed Several
Bogus Checks In Hard wick and
Orleans County Towns In Jail
Sheriff Worthen went to Pike, N.
H., last Friday and about six miles out
in a lumber camp arrested Merton
Watson, alias Merton .Shute, for pas
sing forged checks about a week earl
ier in the village of Hardwick. He
had secured about $117 in this way
and made his escape before it was
found the checks were forged. Watson
is young, about 20 years old, and ac
knowledged his guilt by giving up
$61 in cash,, a ring, dress, suit case and
two sweaters he had bought in Hard
wick.
Since he was placed . in. jail more
checks passed on people in Orleans
county have, been forwarded to the
sheriff and it Is supposed they were
written by the same young man. He
used a variety of names in signing the
checks such as Harold Clark, John
Kilgallen, C. S. Wells, L. H. Wells and
others. It is expected he will waive
examination in municipal court and be
bound over to county court.
Mrs. Horace Allen .of Stannard was
arrested last week for stealing quan
tities of provisions, dynamite and
other articles. It is supposed other
parties were involved with her in the
stealing. She was taken to Stannard
yesterday for a trial before the muni
cipal court.
Joseph Legendre, who left town un
expectedly a few weeks ago has been
located in Hartford, Conn. It is prob
able that as long as he is willing to
keep out of town he will not be, given
another trial for selling liquor.
THE ATHLETIC BENEFIT
Large Attendance At Fine Entertain
ment At The Academy.
The St. Johnsbury Academy Athlet
ic association gave a most successful
benefit at the Academy chapel Fri
day evening and the way their friends
attended must have convinced them
that there is an interest in school ath
letics here. The hall was filled, many
chairs being brought in to increase the
seating capacity of the hall. The
prize of $5 given to the class selling
the largest number of tickets was won
by the Juniors who craftily waited
until the last morning to 'turn in a
large part of their ticket returns. The
program of the . evening, consisted of
selections by thelschool orchestra led
by Miss Elizabeth Peck. the girls'
chorus directed by Miss Ella Brownell
and the boys glee club with H. N.
Wood as leader. To those who rarely
attend academy functions the music
of the orchestra and glee clubs is a
revelation for only a few years ago the
school did very little musical work.
The orchestra certainly plays wonder
fully well for such young musicians
and the glee clubs never fail to give
pleasure wherever they appear.
The principal part of the program
was given by Edward H. Frye of Bos
ton who read Joseph Lincoln's "Cap'n
Warren's Wards." All the humor of
this delightful Cape Cod sailor was
splendidly brought out by Mr. Frye
and the students seemed completely
earried away by his interpretation of
the character of "Uncle Elisha." He
responded to the hearty applause giv
en him by reading twp humorous se
lections which showed that he is as
much at home as an Irishman as he
is as a Yankee from Barnstable coun
ty, Massachusetts.
At a meeting Friday morning the
Junior class, winners of the $5 prize
for selling the most tickets to the ath
letic benefit, voted to turn the prize
over to the Athletic association for
its use.
LOCAL EXPOSITION
Commercial Club to Display In
dustrial Products of St.
Johnsbury.
During the last three weeks a com
mittee of the Commercial ' club has
been steadily working on plans for an
industrial exposition. The exposition
is to be held in the Pillsbury-Baldwin
building and is to cover approximate
ly 20,000 sq. ft. of floor space.
The exhibits are to consist of prod
ucts manufactured or sold in St.
Johnsbury. It is proposed to show the
people of this community and other
communities the advantages that St.
Johnsbury possesses from a trading
and manufacturing standpoint. The
exposition will be instructive,' in that
it . will open the eyes of everybody to
the advantages that the community
possesses commercially and indus
trially. It will be profitable in that it
is the best business proposition that
an exhibitor can get, for with small
expense he can come in direct contact
not only with his own customers but
with the customers of every other ex
hibitor. He can demonstrate his
goods and build up trade relations with
people whom under other conditions
he would be unable to get in contact
with.
The Commercial club believes that
not only is this good constructive-advertising,
but is an opportunity for St.
Johnsbury to make good Its claim to
being the "Hut of Northern New Eng
land." It believes that this is the best
way to advertise the Pillsbury-Bald
win building to a prospective occu
pant; it believes that in this way it
can instill a proper civic pride in the
people of St. Johnsbury; and lastly, it
believes that this is one way in which
the business people can co-operate in
working for the Increased prosperity
of St. Johnsbury.

IS SAME FAMILY 118 YEARS
Three Generations of Whitehills Have
Lived On Ryegate Farm.
The Boston Globe on March 11 had
the following item:
"The Ladd farm in Grand Isle has
been in possession of that family for
118 years, having been first settled by
Andrew Ladd when he came from
Connecticut in 1798. It has never
passed outside the family and is now
occupied by his grandson, H. W. Ladd.
and his son. There are several farms
in Grand Isle which have been in the
families for more than half a century."
The Item attracted the attention of
Nelson J. Whitehill of White River
Junction, a native of Ryegate, and he
sent us the following letter:
"In North Ryegate in your county
are two farms lying side by side that
have been in the possession of the
Whitehill family 118 years, having
been settled by two brothers from
Scotland, James and Abraham White
hill. These farms have only been oc
cupied by three generations of White
hills and on these farms may be seen
today the hale and h3arty grandsons
of the above James and Abraham car
rying on their respective homesteads
with enterprise and vigor."

banks sketched briefly yet compre-1
hensively the development of opera
from the 16th century until the pres
ent time, devoting herself entirely to
England, France. Germany and Italy,
and the principal composers of those
countries. Her talk was not at all
technical but easily understood by

gave great pleasure to all. Follow- j
ing it Mrs. Ida P. Brooks, Miss Maude
E. Follensby. Miss Elizabeth Peck, 1

BUILDING BIRD HOUSES
Sehool Children In A Prize Contest
Arranged By The Musenm.
It was very gratifying to the Fair
banks Museum to have such hearty
co-operation among the teachers and
schools at the time of the Finley lec
tures. Much interest was aroused and
a new enthusiasm to study nature first
hand and enjoy the experience Mr.
Finley so graphically pictured. The
work of the Junior Audubon society
in making and putting up-bird boxes
suggested similar work for our boys
and girls. ...
The Fairbanks Museum is offering
to the pupils of the manual training
classes of the schools of St. Johnsbury
under Mr. Baxter's instruction the
following prizes for the best bird
houses made without help. They are
to be judged on their merits in work
manship, design and utility for birds'
homes;
Prize I, A Berlepsch Bluebird Box.
Prize II, A year's subscription to
"Bird Lore" or a copy of Walker's
"Nests and Their Nestlings."
Prizes III and IV, Tools for making
bird houses.
Prize V, Membership in the Junior
Audubon society and ten colored leaf
lets of birds of different families.
Already Mr. Baxter has had about
50 entries for this competition.
It is probable that some of the bird
house builders will be able to fill ord
ers for houses for use on private estates.
