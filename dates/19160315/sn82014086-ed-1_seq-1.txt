RESSION
DUELS ARE UNDER WAY
British Defeat Tribesmen.
The British evidently are breaking
up the opposition of the Senussi
tribesmen, led by Turkish officers, in
western Egypt. An official report re
ceived from Major General Peyton,
commander of the British forces, says
the occupation of Solium on the
Egyptian-Tripoli frontier, is immi
nent, that the Sheik Harun has sur
rendered and is in the British camp
and that the head men of the Aulad
Ali tribe are begging for peace.
Russians Harass Turks.
The Russians are still harassing the
Turks on the Caucasus front and have
made further progress against the
Teutons in East Galicia. They en
tered German trenches in the region
of Riga, killed the occupants and re
turned to their own .positions, without
suffering any loss.
Strong Attack by Italians.
The Italians are keeping up their
strong infantry offensive, begun sev
eral days ago on the Isonzo front. Es
pecially fierce have been the attacks
around San Martino. Here, Rome
says, the Italians captured Dante del
Croviglio, the pivot in the Austrian
defences and in "the same region
stormed two other places and seized
Austrian trenches.
Vienna, on the othen hand, declares
that near San Martino the Italians
seven times attempted to storm the
Austrian positions but were repulsed
with heavy casualties.

dismissed tomorrow or whether the
defense would be forced to submit its
case to the jury.
After the prosecution had rested ita

J Fallon, arguing against Mr. Bat

FORMER SENATOR LORIMER
ON TRIAL AT CHICAGO.
For Alleged Financial Misdoings in
Connection With Banks.
Chicago, March 14. William Lorl
mer, whose seat in the United States
senate was declared vacant on the
grounds that it was the result of a
political crime, today listened to a re
cital of his alleged financial mlsdings.
William H. Holly, assistant state's
attornev told a jury in Judge Devens
court that the defendant was charged
with conspiracy and embezzlement in
connection with the failure of tho La
Salle Street Trust and Savings bank
in Chicago two years ago.
Mr. Lorimer remained impert'Jrable
throughout the denunciation. Ho ap
pealed little changed since the days
when Illinois called him the "blind
boss."
Hollp said that testimonv which was
not adduced at the trial of C. H. Mun
dy. senior vice president of th- bank
wh was convicted on similar charges,
would 1 intrcaiice!. Lorl;aer s de
fense, it Is said, will be based largely
on the contention that Mr. Lorimer, al
though president of the institution,
trusted the business to Mr. Munday
and was himself absent mu:a of the
time.
Mr. Lorir.iar started ";he La Salle
Street Xational Bank In 1910. when he
was Ui the United States senate, Mr.
Holly said.
Air. Ilo'ly said the first act cf con
spiracy was committed in changing
the bank's name to the La Salle Street
Trust and Savings bank. He said
that Mr. Lorinier and associates, al
though without that amount jf m"ne'
on deposit, gave notes for a as.grgate
ob Jl.250.000 to the La Salle bank. In
return Mr. Lorimer received a
cashier's check for $1,250,000 which he
deposited with the Central Trust
company and the latter sent that much
' current y to the new state bank.
"Xot a cent was paid in." said Mr.
Holly, "but when the stat.i bank ex
aminer came he found the capital
stock, this sel-same 31,250,000, on hand.
The examiner counted the money, gave
his approval and departed. . Then the
money was sent back to the Central
Trust company.
When the bank failed June 11, 1914.
the prosecutor said that of outstanding
loarffc of over three million dollars, $2,
100,000, has been loaned to enterprises
of the three officers named.
NEW YORK SENATE POSTPONES
ACTION ON SUFFRAGE.
Assembly in Afternoon Had Passed
Favorable Vote.
Albany, N. Y., March 14. Jubilation
on the part of the supporters of wom
an suffrage who thronged the capitol
today was changed to disappointment
tonight. Larly this afternoon the as
sembly by a vote of 109 to 30 passed a
bill designed to provide for a suffrage
amendment at the 1917 election, but six
hours later announcement -was made
that the senate Judiciary committee
had indefinitely postponed action on
the measure.
The suffrage majority In the assem
bly was a surprise even to the most
optimistic advocates of the bill.
The announcement of the vote was the
signal for an attempted demonstration
of applause and tho unfurling of suf
frage banners, which was immediately
checked by the sergeants-at-arms.
Then the women, numbering more than
150, and claiming to represent 110 of
the 151 assembly districts of the state,
crossed over to the senate side of the
capitol, where they filled the corridor
outside the senate judiciary committee
room.
For more than six hours the women
waited outside the committee room.
The judiciary committee had a pub
lic hearing on another measure and
considered several other bills in execu
tive session before taking up the suf
frage question.
Some time after 6 o'clock Senator
Clinton T. Horton of Buffalo came from
the committee room and epoke to Mrs.
Whitehouse. Immediately the suffrage
leader climbed upon a chair and, ad
dressing her co-workers, said that Sen
ator Horton had informed her that no
action would be take n today and that
action had been postponed indefinitely.
The suffragists left the capitol after
deciding to find out the reason for the
committee's delay.

Posters a "Trust"
DECI8ION BY FEDERAL JUDGE
LANDIS AT CHICAGO
TO CRUSH COMPETITION
Ruling Given In Government 8ult Ask
ing Dissolution of the Association,
Filed in August, 1912.
Chicago, March 14. The Associated
Bill Posters of the United States and
Canada was held to be a combination
in restraint of trade by Federal Judge
Landis today.
The ruling was given in the govern
ment suit asking dissolution of the
association, flled in August, 1912.
"The rule of 'reasonable restraint
has no application here," said Judge
Landis, "for the reason that this is
not a case of mere restraint, but of
total exclusion. .
Sixty Days to Permit Appeal.
The court ruled that the Injunction
asked by the government to restrain
the bill posters from carrying on their
Dusiness as an organization would not
go into effect for sixty days to permit
an appeal to the court.
ine complaint charged that ever
since its organization in 1891 the As
socaited Bill Posters had sought to
crush competition. It was alleged In
support of the dissolution suit that
membership in the organization was
limited to one member in each town:
that its members were barred from ac
cepting work from tiny advertiser who
furnish"' .--. to non-advertisers;
that a schedule of prices was arttpti
for all parts oi tuc country; that com
petitors were bought off and that
members were prohibited from ac
cepting work from solicitors not li
censed by the organization.
Sought to Crush Independents.
One of the contentions of the gov
ernment in the trial of the case, which
began last Mar. vu that the aunri.1.
tion in 1910" sought to force out of
business any lithographer who attemDt
ed to work with an independent bill
poster or advertiser. The government
turther charged that In 1911 the asso
elation allied itself with twelve na
tional advertising agencies and there
after no advertiser could hope to hr.ve
his lithographs displayed other than
tnrougn one or these recognized agen
cies.
In his ruling Judge Landis said:
Ruling by Judge Landis.
"Evidence was presented bv the de
femiants of a generM improvement In
and aevolpment of the whole bill nam
Ing business during the- existence of
tne organization. But granting this
evidence all that the defendants claim
ed for it, the court is of the opinion
that the decree must go to the com
plainant for the reason that the whole
spirit and policy of our law is opposed
to agreements among persons and cor
porations designed to exclude other
persons from legitimate commerce."
