TO THE SENATE TODAY
WASHINGTON, March 17. A.
joint .resolution, authorizing the
president to bring the regular army
up to full strength by adding 19,447
men to existing organizations, was
passed In the house late today with
out objection or debate and with
only one dissenting vote. This would
bring the strength of the regular
army up to 120,000 men.
Representative Hay, chairman of
the military committee, had asked
for Immediate consideration of the
resolution, saying the step was
necessary on account of demands of
c.Itlsens. along the border -for addi
tional protection during the march
of the punitive expedition into Mex
ico. ' Socialist in Negative.
There wat no objection and the resolu
tion was passed In five minutes. On the
vivi voce vote one "nay" was heard.
Minority Leader Mann demanded a rising
vote, whch resulted 238 to 1, Representa
tive London, socialist, or New xorK,
otlng in the negative.
Representative Hay told the house the
administration had recommended this
J plan rather than call for the militia or
volunteers. The president wanted to
allay any suspicion, he said, that the
government sought to accomplish nothing
in the Mexican expedition except the pur
suit of Villa,
The resolution will be called in the sen
ate tomorrow.
How It Afreets Border.
Senators who were consulted by house
leaders and War department officials as
serted late today that tha Increase to be
authorized by the house resolution would
add approximately 8,000 or 9,000 men to
the regiments now on the Mexican border,-
bringing that force up to a total of
about 27,000 men.
-While the War , department has the
cower to raise the men without congres
sional action, Secretary Baker desired to
obtain the agreement of support from
leader at both parties Tn order to" be
assured that a point of order would not
be raised When the resolution cams Up
for passage.
The present strength of the army Is
about 87.003 men. The additional troops
are desired to fill the place of men who
may bo withdrawn from their present
locattops for service In Mexico.
To Co Over Situation.
Representative Kahn said Secretary
Baker went over the entire situation
with Chairman Hay and himself and
atisfted them that the men were needed.
The secretary said that no new develop
ments had come in the Mexican situation
hlclt would cause the department to de
Ira to Increase the standing force, but
that army officials were convinced it
would be beat at this time to fill the
places of soldiers leaving this country.
Secretary Baker later explained thit
it wee proponed to Increase all reglmeuts
of the mobile army to full strength which
would bring the total strength of the
regular up to approximately 120,000 men,
Including the quartermaster's corps, med
ical corps and other auxiliary troopa.
The strength of the mobile army would
be raised from 33,000 to 50,000. which would
be the number available for border duty.
Lous than SSO.WO are now on duty on the
Mexican border.
As the various arms of the service are
now distrlouted as to personnel the order
would add 16,000 enlisted men in the In
fantry 1,100 to the field artillery and 2.AI0
to the calvalry.

dis today.

Secretary Lansing
Takes Vacation
WASHINGTON, March 11-Secretary
Lansing was on his way to Plnehurst,
N. C, today for a week's vacation. For
many weeks the secretary has been
working steadily In a heavy preasure of
diplomatic affairs and feels the need of
a rest. Taking a vacation at this time
waa regarded here as indicative of how
completely the State department regards
the Mexican situation In the hands of
the army and that the understanding
with General Carransa is complete.
llco, he said, la about 44. American naval
officers under the present system are
close to SO when thy become rear ad
mirals. "The navy Is a soft snap to those whe
are not ambitious," ha said, "but deadly
to the ambitious ones. As a military
proposition this age situation la abso
lutely rotten; from a social standpoint it
la excellent, and as a soft snap It's a
peach."
Captain Sims said Secretary Daniels
waa the first secretary of the navy upon
whom those favoring promotion by se
lection had made any Impression.
"If he puts It across," said the captain,
"he will stand out above all other secre
taries of the navy, for it will mean a tre
mendous Increase In naal efficiency."
The witness referred to what he called
frightful mistakes In the turret designs
of the Kentucky and other predread
nauKhts whose sloping turret designs
mado them partirulaily vulnerable to
Ions range fire under the changed gun
fire con1ilion.i of recent cars.

A circumstantial story reached here
today from Mexican sources to tha effect
that , Villa, had oniva moa , changed his '
plans and Intended making g stand
against the American punitive expedi
tion at Ujitos pass, tha narrow gap in
the western Chihuahua Sierras, through
which he made his murderous dash at
Columbus. ,
Americans familiar with the country
assert that OJitos pass is admirably
adapted for a successful defense It Villa
really , Intends to risk an open engage
ment with the American troopa -and docs
not Intend to try and evade tha end by
guerilla tactlca.
All night long reports of the most
sensational character poured , Into this
city from varloua points along tha bor
der, but nearly all lacked confirmative
details. Tha most definite came from
Naco, Arts. For soma days reports have
reached here from the border near Naco,
of heavy movements of Carransa. troops
under Uencral Calles. Early today it
was asserted that a considerable number
of these troops were showing Increasing
hostility toward Americans and might
even espouse tha eauae of Villa, The
United States military authorities were '
sufficiently aroused to these stories to
rush reinforcements to the garrison at
Naco.
VI H Aarala Active.
Stories of the activity ef Villa agwnU
have poured Into Fort Bliss and have been
received in large number by the civil
authorities. Several arrests her already
been made and others are expected to
follow. One such story Is to the effect
that the Villa sympathisers are using

across the border. The man who brought
thla story Is an American living on tha

seen one dog with a roll of paper tied
around his neck running across tha

animal, but failed to hit It.
