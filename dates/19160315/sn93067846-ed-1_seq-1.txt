WOULD HANDLE COTTON RE?
CEIPTS.
J. A. Banks Said to Be Organising
Bank for Purpose.
Columbia State, March 13.
Arthur Banks of St. Matthews, State
senater from Calhoun county, pur?
poses "to organise in South Carolina
a bank, with small capital stock, to
handle nothing but receipts issued by
State warehouses of South Carolina,
these receipts to be discounted at the
federal reserve bank in Richmond.
So asserts Robert L. Shipp, a Col
ouitt county member of the Georgia
legislature, In a statement printed
yesterday by the Atlanta Constitution.
Judge Shipp has hopes of procuring
the erection of a State warehouse sys?
tem in Georgia. He was in New York
and Richmond last week with Senator
Banks and the South Carolina ware?
house commissioner, John L. McLau
rin.
Senator Banks' plan, Judge Shipp
ia quoted as saying, "will give the
small farmer In South Carolina money
on his cotton as cheaply as it can
now be had by the larger farmer In
the State, besides which it will not
be necessary for him to ship his cot?
ton away from his home county. In
fact, If a farmer raises enough cot?
ton?say 300 bales?he can build a
warehouse on his own farm, place it
I under the State system by giving
Ipropcr bond, and hold his cotton on
his own farm until he is ready to
sell. In the meantime ho can use
tho receipts issued on this cotton in
this warehouse and borrow money
thereon at about 5 per cent. Interest."

M'liUMN OFFERS PROTECTION
ARRANGEMENTS MADE TO CARE
FOR INSURANCE.

That Number of Companies With?
drawing Has Been Exaggerated.
Columbia. March 11.?In a state?
ment given to the press, \*hich was
published Friday morning, the State
warehouse commissioner, John L.
McLaurin, said that he would have
something more definite to give out
later. Yesterday afternoon he gave
out an additional statement, in which
he said that "in anticipation of the
action of the Southeastern Under?
writers' association In getting compa?
nies to withdraw from South Caro?
lina, and especially the threats as to
insurance upon property upon which
loans are outstanding in the at?
tempt to force the calling of the
loans," he went to New York and
had made arrangements there which
'were ample to take care of all such
insurance. He stated that he be?
lieves the number of the withdrawals
by companies from this State has
been exaggerated, and that after this
excitement is over it will be found
that there are plenty of companies in
South Carolina to do the business.
"But if any one desires to place in?
surance, which is necessary on ac?
count of the present situation as the
result of cancellations or refusals to
renew; if they will write to me I will
place the insurance in New York
through the channels which I have
arranged," he said.
"The policies," said Mr. McLaurin,
"will be written in companies whose
standing is acceptable to the life in?
surance or mortgage companies mak?
ing loans in South Carolina. I wish
to reiterate emphatically that if any
one is threatened with the calling of
loans or in any other manner to the
detriment of the business Interests of
South Carolina by the cancellation or
failure to renew fire insurance poli?
cies, t I can place this insurance in
SOnW oT'tn'e besl^ companies In the
Hjj^jd^ftates^ and this talk about

"I have been flooded wtsPTWusps!
from insurance agents requesting that
I furnish them the names of the com?
panies In order that they may form
connections with them. I desire to
say that I have not felt called upon
to seek insurance connections for
agents of companies which arc with?
drawing or may withdraw, but that
I am simply seeking to protect the
business interests of the people of
South Carolina from threatened dis?
arrangement by the Southeastern
Underwriters' association and have
perfected arrangements to this end."
