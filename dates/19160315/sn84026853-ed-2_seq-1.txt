A YEAR. :
AMERICANS SLAIN
; By VILLA BANDITS
DOZEN OR MORE MEN AND I
WOMEN MURDERED BY
BANDITS.
Columbus, N. M., March 9.?Five
hundred Mexican bandits, believed to
have been led by Francisco Villa, .
-crossed the border under cover of '
darkness early today and attacked
this town, killing a dozen or more 1
American men and women, including
at least six United States soldiers, i'
When the bandits fled toward Mex-!
ico some hours later they were pur- '
sued by United States troops, who
are said to have crossed the border.
v A large number of Mexican dead
were left lying in the streets of Col- 1
umbus and at the border the Mexi- 1
cans were subjected to a flank at- :
tack by American troops and 18
more of their number killed.
Several American citizens in Col
umbus declared they personally saw
Villa directing- his men and a portmanteau
found by a trooper con- :
tained Villa's papers.
The attack was a surprise. Villa
'was supposed to have been 44 miles i
away, having last night caused a tele- 1
gram to be sent indicating his pres- I
ence at a Nogales ranch. .
Four men, citizens of Columbus, <
and two women, are known to have
been killed. Three other men and
a woman are listed among the dead, i
Prior to the attack the Villa bandits
hanged three Americans whom
they had held as prisoners for some
<lays, according to information received
here. Their bodies were
burned the report said.
The Villa men were said to have
"been joined by Carranza soldiers after
they crossed the border. A deep
-ditch parallels the United States
army camp, the customs house and
the railroad station. Through this
.gully the bandits approached unnoticed.
After posting snipers at advantageous
points the bandits set fire to ,
innln^incr fViA railwftv sta
UUliUlIlgo taviwu...^ ?
tions and hotels. As people rushed
from ther homes they were shot
down. i
Civilians armed themselves and together
with United States soldiers,
fought a battle of several hours with
the bandits.
Col. Slocum's revolver was shot
from his hand as he left his quarters.
Some of the bandits by spealang English
lured housefolk to the streets
and then shot them. From burning
hotels and other structures persons
who sought to escape were killed
or wounded.
When dawn came the retreat of
the Villa men was under way. Villa
himself apparently had left earlier.
In the streets lay bodies of a number
-of Mexican dead. Many Mexican
wounded were removed to the post
hospital.
Information that Francisco Villa
and his chief lieutenant, Pablo Lopez,
were in personal command was given
Col. Slocum by a Mexican rancher
who escaped during the fighting. He
told of the hanging of the Americans
ranchers McKinney, Corbett and
O'Neil, and declared that a fourth
American whose name he did not
know, had also been hanged.
The Mexican said Villa attacked
with from 800 to 1,000 men, and a
machine gun platoon.
The Mexican told Col. Slocum that
Villa left the Bosques Grandes ranch J
Tuesday, made a leisurely journey
north and about 4 o'clock yesterday
left a point on the Boca Grande and
started for the border.
"Traveling north they crossed the
"boundary west of Columbus," said I
the Mexican and entered town by a I
ditch running past the cavalry camp. I
Villa was in personal charge and declared
he was going to kill every f
American because the American government
did not treat him right. Vil-!
la said Carranza could not bring,
peace in Mexico. With Villa were j
Pablo Lopez, Martin Lopez, Col. '
Candelario Sevantes, Colonel Cruz
Chavez, Gen Jose Fernandez and Gen
Ueltran." j
The Mexican confirmed a report !
that before leaving the Santa Ana 1
district in western Chihuahua, Villa
ImH freelv stated that he intended to
force intervention by raiding American
territory and killing civilians and
soldiers.
Lieut. Clyde Ely, with twenty men \
of the new Mexican national guard,
arrived from Deming today and joined
the Feedral troops. j|
Capture Them Dead or Alive it
Command. j!
Washington, March 10.?President'
Wilson today ordered American
troops over the Mexican border to
capture or kill the Villa bandits who
yesterday raided Columbus, N. M. |
Major General Scott, chief of staff
of the army, announced that the exnmnlH
consist. of not less
than 5,000 men aii of which are ;
available on the border under Major J
General Funston. '
It was decided at today's cabinet
meeting that Villa and his bandits
must be caught. A statement is
being prepared at the White House
and will be issued later today.
In its present stage, the president's.
order does not mean armed intervention
in Mexico. It provides for
a punitive expedition to deal with
lawless forces over which .the Carran

he would be a candidate for Gover-jvil
nor in the Democratic primary this | At
summer. Mr. Cooper's announce-'' tic
ment was made after a conference'J.
with friends from many sections of .an
the State, who had come to Green-1
wood for the purpose of considering Gr
his duty in the coming campaign. Mr!
Cooper has been here all the week Sc
attending court as solicitor for this j
circuit, and Greenwood is easily ac-'
cessible, hence its selection as a Th
meeting place for his friends. CI
In making the announcement Mr. ]
Cooper stated that his platform |
would be given in due time. Those '
close to Mr Cooper say that he makes an

position will be known. He has
been urged, it is claimed, by men in an
all sections of the State for the past tic
six months to offer as a candidate for 3
Governor this summer.. Although ur
missing the nomination for Governor.
two years ago by a very close margin, ac
around two hundred votes, it was an
not Mr. Cooper's intention to thrust E>
himself into the political situation in an
South Carolina this year. He at ha
first declined all suggestions to this sei
effect, but it is said that the requests his
for him to offer as a candidate have nu
become so frequent and so insistent
that he feels it a duty to yield to the
judgment of his friends in this mat- W
ter. It is stated that he has never of
sought public office on anything other
than his own merit and does not in- W
tend to deviate from this principle si\
now.

pr
Columbia, March 8.?Special; A te!
telegram received to-day from John
L. McLaurin. State warehouse commissioner,
who is on his way home
from New York, stated that there .
need be no alarm over the fire insurance
situation in this State. Mr.
McLaurin's dispatch also said that
there would be no difficulty in plac- ??
ing insurance in safe companies ei- vi
ther in New York or London. Com- 7~
missioner McLaurin is expected to
reach Columbia early in the morning.
za government has no control. 1
The following statement was issued
at the White House: v-f
"An adequate force will be sent at
once in pursuit of Villa with the sin- an
gle object of capturing him and put- ee
ting a stop to his forays. .va
"This can be done and will be done la'
in entirely friendly aid of the con- Pa
stituted authorities in Mexico and ~c
with scrupulous respect for the sov- be
ereignty of that republic."
It was explained at the White ,
House that the American government
uranic Villa rlonH r?r fllivft and that
no steps will be neglected to carry
out that object.
It was declared, however, that the .e
United States will not consider the &T
expedition as an invasion of Mexico Pl1
and will continue to deal with the s?(
Carranza government. The Ameri- ?
can government is still opposed to be.
armed intervention, but has decided, mi
that the peace of Mexico and the I
United States is imperilled by the1
continued activities of Villa. i?h
The cabinet was unanimous in de- *?
ciding that Villa must be caught. ur
Secretary Baker left the White ne
Hnnsp +n confer with Maior General ur
Hugh L. Scott, chief of staff, and A
other army officers to decide just how ea
many troops would be needed to fol- ou
low Villa. |th<
It was said that the pursuit of Vil- an
la will be undertaken in a compre-!
hensive way and organized plans will ed
be laid for his capture. |Shi
Officials received the word with arj
undisguised satisfaction. Cabinet sic
members expressed themselves as im
greatly pleased. Army officers voic- pa
ed unanimous approval. A general
feeling of relief that the administra- co:
tion had finally decided to take the ru
step was apparent.
The president himself is firmly con-1
vinced of the necessity of eliminating els
Villa from the Mexican situation, on
He is represented as just as deter- inj
mined to get rid of Villa as he was Be
to oust Huerta.
The announcement of the inten- Sc
tion of the president to send troops
into Mexico was accompanied by
scenes not equalled at the White
House since the determination to

Carranza will be notified immediately
that the United States has no dy
