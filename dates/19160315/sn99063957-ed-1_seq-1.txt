.SAYS VILLA TINANCED BY
INTERESTED AMERICANS
Mexico City, Mar. 15. Well
laiil pin us to force American
intervention in Mexico were de
feated by President Wilson's
acceptance of Provisional Presi
dent Veiuistiano Carranza 's
military reciprocity proposals,
Carranzistus asserted today.
Carranza knew of these plans.
He believed the Villa raid on
Columbus. X. M.n was financed
by American interests seeking
intervention.
Patriotic demonstrations con
. tinned today, foliuwrng tfie an
nouncement thnt American-Mexican
differences had all been
settled. Military bands paraded
the streets, playing itatiunnl
airs.
Ml Pso.Toxas, Mar. 15. An iron elnd
military censorship thnt even refused
confirmation or denial of the report
that Hachita, N. M., hail been seized by
by n Carranzistn army, caused the be
lief today that the American expedi
tionary force was about to move.
Hrigndied General John ,T. Persh
ing's ordern were for him to cross the
border when ready. Americans from
Columbus, X. M.. where Pershing has
established headquarters, arrived at
Doming, X. M., today, and declared the
soldiers were ready to march earlv to
(lav. The stringent censorship at Colum
bus makes it plain that the troops will
enter Mexico hours before newspaper
correspondents are allowed to flash de
tails. With the report that .1,000 cavnlrv
would make up the flving column to
encompass Francisco Villa, armv men
gave out the impression that it' would
not be an infantry expedition. Tt is
believed the in'fantry coming to the
boundary from interior posts will lie
used only for the purpose of guarding
the line.
General Pershing is keeping in wire
less touch with Major General Fred
Funston. It is expected the American
advance guards will dash upon Guz
man, a small Mexican town, and estab
lish their first base of operations there.
Latest reports concerning the where
ab,.urs of Villa said he was in Oalennn
district marching upon the settlement
of Americnn Mormons. General Gu-'
tierrez, Carrnnzistn nrmv leader, is due
to leave Juarez for Chihuahua immedi
ately personally to lead his soldiers in
their pursuit of the arch bandit. His
earlier statement that he had o'.Oui

to the assertion that he had LOOP

Move Made to Recall Sol
diers from Philippines
Washington, Man 15. The Hay
Chamberlain resolution increasing the
size of the regular army to its full
strength of 1110,000 men was adopted
today by the sen.ite. It provides for
an immediate increase.
Jlolie .Smith was the only senator to
oppose the resolution during the debate,
lie proposed an amendment making the
enlistment term two years instead of
the usual four. Smith said ho was
igainst Ion;; enlistments, and that, in
the present case, he felt sure the re

The senate enjoyed unlimited debute

Senator Sherman introduced resolu
tion suggesting thnt the American
forces be withdrawn from tiie Philip

regulars could be sent to Mexico. They
would be ideal soldiers in that, tropical
climate. Furthermore, they have been
well trained in guerilla warfare. "
He said he would leave 5,700 native

garrison.
STORY NOT CONFIRMED
Ml Paso, Texas, Mar. 15. A
Villista band looted homes on

Mexico, last night, according to

German Crown Prince Hopes
to Break French Lines
North of Verdun
IF SUCCESSFUL THIS

French However Are Confid
ent Teutons Will Be Fought
to a Standstill
By Charles P. Stewart.
(Tnited Press staff correspondent.)
London, Mar. 15. Between the shell
shuttered town of Betliincourt and the
slopes of Dead Man's hill, the Germans
have driven a new wedge deep into the
French defenses, Berlin messages an
nounced today.
Teutons surround Betliincourt on
three sides, and a slight further ad
vance, it is declared, would force the
French to evacuate the city, French
strongholds on Dead Man's hill are
again imperiled by this resumption of
infantry attacks on Verdun.
Latest Paris communiques contra
dicted these German cluims. They admit
there were infantry attacks in the
specified region following an almost un
precedented bombardment, but assert
all charges were replsed except at two
isolated points between Betliincourt and
Dead Man's hill.
It is indicated mat tho assaults
there mark the beginning of a most
severe battle which may prove to be
the last phase of the Verdun 'fight, r
is believed that the German crown
prince hopes by a brilliant stroke to
break French lines northwest o'f the
citadel. If such a smash were success
ful, the French army on the Mouse cast
bank would be trapper) and it woub)
mean the capture of great quantities of
munitions, supplies and artillery am
munition, as well as the probable sur
render of many soldiers.
Paris dispatches said military ex
perts there were awake to the danger of
new (iernian successes. The critie-s said:
"Were, the Germans to gain Verdun
via Douaumont and Vaux it would lv
an empty victory. They would lose
.'iOO.OOO more men for an empty husk.
"Success via Goose If ill and Betliin
court might be more substaniul. The
French are holding the Lorraine front
on the east Bide of the river. Their
guns and material run the risk of rap
ture as the main brigades spanning the
Mouse might be commanded by the foe.
General Petitin's precautions guard
against surprise. The Germans are ex
pected to hurl solid musses against
Dead Man's and Goose Hills. A
French are convinced the Teuton wi'
be fought to a standstill."
Aviators Raid Essen.
London, Mar. 15. Allied' aviators

Washington, Mir. 15. Washington
today anxiously awnited first news
from the .Mexican battle ground. The
American expedition was supposed to
be moving against Francisco Villa. Al
though officials as well is the public
were blinded by n comprehensive cen
sorship, they believed Brigadier Gener

in Mexico or so situated that he would
be there before the day ended.

Defense Tries In Vain to Get
' Her Raliied Will Try to
Prove an Alibi
Oroville, Cal., March 15. Words
from ltev. Madison Slaughter's ger
mons crept into tho letters Gertrude
Lamson, 15 years old, wrote dnnying
her immorality charges against him,
according to her testimony under cross
examination in Slaughter's trial to
day. The girl said she inserted the phrase
"I pray God to forgive and forget"
because she had heard Slaughter say
it frequently in the pulpit.
Gertrudo today blamed the entire in
spiration for the letter of denial on
her mother's alleged coaching. She
reiterated repeatedly thut she was
"telling the truth" when she accused
Slaughter.
As the girl manifested signs of labor
ing under a great strain, Judge Gregory
occasionally ordered brief recesses to
let her regain her composure.
Defense attorneys sprang a sensation
when they suddenly charged that Char
lotto. Kegan, an officer of the deten
tion home, who has custody of Ger
trude, was signaling to her from the
audience. Judge Gregory overruled
the objections.
Many women have asked the district
attorney for permission to adopt the
girl. '

examination. Every effort was made
to confuse and trip her. At times she
complained of headache or had spells
of trembling but she always adhered
to her reiterated statement:
"Everything I have said is the
truth." "
The defease cainied today that the
prosecution had shifted the date of
the alleged attack from November 7
to November 11, because it was dis
covered the girl was infused in .bar
story of what happened Xuvember 7,
anil it was further ascertained the
pastor had a clear ulibi for that oc

also had an alibi for NoveinKcr 14,
and that it would be proved when the

Han Antonio, Texas, Mar. 15. Major

this afternoon thnt Colonel Doild's cav

asked him to confirm reports of cavalry

Funston replied: "Dodd's probably
crossed, but he's out of communication
with concentration points at the place
of crossing, which was about !!) miles
from Columbus in a sniiight liae from
the town."
Fuasloa also said: "The report that
our cavalry has been in an engagement
is interesting, and may be true. Frank
ly, I tun out of toucTi with Colonel
Dodd 's column, lie will get into wire
less communication with General Persh
ing before evening, I expect, and then
I'll h"iir details. Reports of fightie
so soon lifter crossing were unexpected,
