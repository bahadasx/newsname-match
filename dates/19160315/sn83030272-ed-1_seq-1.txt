du ront of New York and Delaware
for the ttepubllcan Presidential nomina
tion will be formally launched.
Mr. dti Pont if mild to desire the
Presidential nomination. Ills friends
believe he has a chance and they are
arranging the second choice support for
him. lie will go into the convention.
It was asserted to-day, as the "favorite
son" of Delaware.
Tho du Pont boom started In New
York weeks ago, and lias Been steered
carefully without noise, but with an
occasional Indication that It wivs mov
ing. Senators and Heprescntatlve
who have gone to New York have been
taken Into the contldenco of some of the
men who back Mr. du Pout, and have
been asked frankly what they thought
of the Idea of a business man for
President.
A candid avowal of nluiut will soon be
mode. It was said to-day. There will be
no rurther attempt to conceal the du
Pont movement. Headquarters will be
opened and the boom started llkn other
well regulated Presidential candidacies.
The du Pont movement will be pushed
on the theory that the country should
get away from practical politicians and
lawyirs and put a real business man In
the White House.
For several weeks word has been com
ing to Washington from the Held scouts
of the other booms that a mysterious du
Pont movement was under way. The
story goes that the so-called business
men's campaign considered several names
for the nomination. Including that of
Henry D. 1-stabrook, but finally deter
mined that Col. du Pont offered the bet
opportunity for development of a real
business men s campaign.
From this time forward things are ex
pected to move rapidly. The du Pont
boomers claim to be looking to Pennsyl
vania and New York for second choice
support. Thty have already been active
In Maryland, and tracks of the business
man's campaign have been discovered In
ome of the political strategy of the
South.
Politicians In Washington have been
aware of the du Pont movement and
havt; watched it develop with more than
passing Interest. One or two Senators

I!1. MKI)MN A TAltGET
IUn Authority to Investigate
Prison Questioned Delve
Into His Past.
White Plains, N. T.. March 14.
Thomas Mott Osborne may walk out to
morrow from the courtroom where for
two days he has been on trial for per
jury, freed of the charge, the first of
the two Indictments against htm dis
missed. The decision rests with Jus
tice Tompkins, who said he was In
clined to believe Mr. Osborne technically
not guilty of perjury.
Tho entire question at issue which
Justice Tompkins has to decide Is
whether tho Investigation made at Hlng
Slug on October ft, 1913, by Dr. Itudolph
Dledllng, a member of the Prison Com
mission, had any standing In law and
whether Dr. Dledllng had a right to ad
minister an oath and take testimony. .It
was at this investigation that Mr. Os
borne Is alleged to have perjured him
helf. The decision, and so perhaps the ques
tion of whether Mr. Osborne shall be freed
without even having to enter a defence
or shall spend ten years In State prison,
hinges upon the Interpretation Justice
Tompkins places upon a single comma.
That comma Is In section 47 of the
prison law, which regulates the Prison
Commission. The nearest Justice Tomp
kins came to forecasting his decision was
when he said, during argument by As
sistant District Attorney Fallon and
licorso Gordon Battle. Mr. Osborne's
counsel :
"It kcoiiik to mo under the statute that
an Individual member of the Prison
Commission cannot make an Investiga
tion of a prison, swear witnesses and
take testimony under oath without the
authorization of the commission. The
Iower to Inspect and Investigate Is given
to the commission and not to an Indi
vidual." IHedllnK Had No Aathorlty.
Dr. Dledllng had no authorization
from the commission : neither he nor
the State) has allege.! that he bad It and
there has been no testimony at the trial
or elsewhere to show that he had. Con
sequently If he had no authorization
and authorization Is required, his whole
proceeding hasno standing and no mat
ter what Mr. Osborne might have testi
fied before him Mr. Osborne could not
be charged with perjury because the
oath Dr. DledJItig adinltilterd was not
binding. That Is the Inference to be
drawn and that is Mr. Battle's conten
tion. The Htate'H forcts were almost speech
less at Justice Tompkins's evident In
tention to consider seriously Mr. Hat

motion that the defence always makes bntiy to lesrii if they could secure Cor
and that the Judge almost Invariably , Union for Thursday night. Finding that

effort to Impress upon the court that , mediately begun for a public demonstrs
his was the proper construction of the , Hon. ....
law and that the Indictment he had.
drawn should not be dismissed without
oven a defence having been entered. It
wiih In so doing that he pointed out the
comma.
"Why, we require the services of a
schoolmaster, not a lawyer, here, Mr.
Fallon," sld Justice Tompkins.
Then Mr. Fallon remarked that Justice
Morschauser already had rejected the
same or a flmllar motion, though of
course before testimony hail been taken.
"The responsibility rests In the court
here, now," Justice Tompkins remarked,
"though of course I'll consider Judge
Morsrhauser's decision."
Comfort for tke State,
The Stale, however, found romfnrt In
one thing that Justice Tompkins said In
the course of the argument.
"I think there is enough evidence In
this ruse on tho question of knowledge
of this defendant to have it submitted to
the Jury."
This referred, however, to Mr. Battle's
second argument for dismissal, that the
Stale had failed to show that Mr. Os
borne attempted wlltully to deceive Dr.
Dledllng. rather than to the basic con
tention that It whs Impossible for any
body to cojiinilt perjury before Dr. Dled
llng hwautsc his Inquiry had no legal
KtrttUS.
The section of the Penal Ta.w, sec
tlon , In which icx;urs the questioned
comma m ss follous:
"The institutions subject to the visi
tation f said commission (the Prison
Commission, of which Dr. Dledllng if
a member) may be visited and Inspected
by It or by any member thereof or by
Its eccrotary. when authorized,
Any member r the secretary of such
commleslon, when authorized,
shall have full access to the grounds,
buildings, books and papers relating to
such Institution, and may require from
tho ottlcers and perwops In charge any
information."
The lection then goes on to say, "Such
commission or any member thereof may
take proof nnd hear testimony relating
to any matter beforu It, or before such
member, upon any such visit or Inspec
tion.'' The defence contends that the section
means that a member or secretary must
Is- authorized by tho t'ommlsslon to In
veMlh'atc a prison. The State holds that
the commit after, "by Its sectetary"
means that the secretary only, not a
member, must be so authorized by the
conimlsHlon.
Under tht first construction Dr. Died.
ling, .not being authorized, had no right
i tti take testimony. Under the second
pr, Dledllng, being n member and not
' .. - ., i .,
tlie secreutry, necneu nu iiiiiuorizaiion
nnd could take testimony. Of this the.
ory Judge Tompkins hiid'thls to say to
Mr Fallon'
' "'Then your proposition Is that any one
of the seven Prison Commissioners can
of his own accord go at any time tn
any prison for no cause, und take -testimony?"
"It Is," said Mr. Fallon,
Dr. Dledllng on the Hlatnl,
Surprised as the State undoubtedly
was nt the turn In events brought on
by Jii"tlce Tompkins's cnnsldeintlon of
Mr. Battle's motion nnd his evident In
clination to entertain seriously the idea
that Dr, Dledllng was nothing but it

of the doctor himself must have
