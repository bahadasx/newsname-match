ADDRESS
Delivered by Mrs.. C I), t hcnaull. of
lxinglon, at I. A. R. Convention
Louisville, October 25-26.
Why I Am For Wilson,
(lly Thos. A. Edison.)
I'm for Woodrow Wilson. When
it's America that's at stake men have
got to vote as Americans. It i. just
one big thing after another with Wil
son. Wilson has won victories by
diplomacy that are far more impor
tant to mankind than any victories
that we could have won by w ar.
They say Wilson has blundered.
Perhaps he has. But I notice that he
usually blunders forward.
.Mr. Wilson has now had about four
years of experience, and I lliink that
he has earned faith anil trust. I do
not hink it a logical or sensible thing
to change to an inexperienced and un
tried man jart for the sake of change.
Even our patient and long suffer
ing Republican neighbor, the Tribune,
ffnds Mr. Hughes' I.usilania state
ment too atisurd to be taken scrious-
l as a policy of government. It says
"The Tribune disagrees with Mr.
Hughes in the mater of the l.usitania
if by his Ixiuisville utterance he
-nt tn exnress the belief that had
the German government known in ad
vance that the sinking of the l.usitan
ia would be followed merely by a sev
erance of diplomatic relations it would
have refrained from the crime.
For four months no effort has been
spnred to smoke Mr. Hughes out on
the vital issues of the campaign.
These efforts have been uniformly un
successful, but at last he was com
pelled to say something detinite about
the Lusitania case. Then he made
the most nonscnsicnl contribution to
the discussion of the German crisis
that the enmpaign has produced.
What makes the matter worse. Mr.
Hughes must have known that it was
both ridiculous and demagogic. HI
informed as he is about international
relations and foreign affairs, it is in
credible that a man of his general in
telligence and trained habits of
thought should be so ignorant as his
Louisville statement implies. New
York World.
The strength of Woodrow Wilson
in Indiana, as in Michigan and Ohio,
is a positive and not a negative
strength. It is not founded on a
sense of the deficiencies of Candidate
Hughes, but on the gratitude to the
Democratic administration for its
legislative record, and above all, for
having steered the country safely
through foreign entanglements. Any
one who gets away from party poli
ticians and talks to the plain leople
is impressed by the breadth and
depth of the average middle Western
er's solicitude for a peaceable national
pnli. v. The phrase "he kept us out
of war," does not seem cheap w emp
ty to a large body of Indiunians, at
any rate. Indiana has a large Ijuak
er population, and it is for W ilson, al
most to a man, because of his peace
policy; she also has many Punkards
and Mennonites within her borders
and they are for Wilson for te same
reason. The Jewish population of
Indiana is said to be for Wilson be
cause of the appointment of Mr.
Brandies to the Supreme Court bench
and the fact that Mr. Morgenthau
and Mr. Untcrmyer are among the
prominent representatives of their
race that are close within the councils
of the national administration Cour
ier Journal.
Mudam Sfate Hegent, Daughters,
Ladies and Gentlemen:
The Kentucky "Dhuk1,Ui of th
American Revolution" most grateful
ly acknowledge this royal greeting
so gracefully and beautifully express
ed by her able and honored "Son.'
It is a splendid testimonial of Louis
ville's proverbial hospitality and high
appreciation of the unselfish, patriot
ic work of her "Daughters" and we
wish to expresB to the John Marshall
and Fincantle Chapters, the Sons of
the devolution and Club, our great
pleasure in being with them at this
time. We wish to assure you of our
earnest desire to stand with you on
the common ground of patriotism in
the fullest sense of the word. It is
the sincere desire of each "Daughter"
to;
"Be a woman! Cn to duty!
"Haise the world from all that's
low;
"Place high in the social heaven;
"Virtues fair and radiant bow
"I.end their influence to each effort
"That shall raise our nature human
"Be not fashion's gilded lady,
"Be a brave, whole-souled, true
woman."
When we think of the great, terri
ble, bloody struggle of our ancestors
to give us America, "the land of the
free and the home of the brave," we
pause at the magnitude of the re-
ponsibility that rests with each one
of us to act well our part that our
dsd heroes shall not have suffered
and sacrificed in vain.
Somewhere it haa been said that
Woman is the conscience of the
world. All that is (lark in man, she
must purge into purity; all that is
failing she must strengthen into
truth. In all the world's clamor, in
her she would lind his praise; through
II the world's wurfarc, in her she
ould find his peace. In a good wo
man's presence, all should be nobler
than their want.'-'
Wo, must believe that this great
great organiiation, with its splendid
inheritance in the oral uplienve) of
our times, In the strenuous days of
war and rumors of war," is striving
honestly and faithfully to do its part
to stand for purity of American life
and Nobility of American Standards,
usin'f this influence on our sons,
brothers, husbands, to such a life of
civic purity that this Republic shall
be the Beacon Light of the world;
that they shall love its history, its
standards, its opportunities and say
with Pwight:
"God bless our native land,
"Firm may she ever stand,
"Thro storm and night;
"When the wild tempests rave,
"Ituler of wind anil wave,
"Do thou our country save
"By thy great might.
"For her our prayers shall rise,
"To God above the skies
"On him we wait;
"Thou art ever nigh
"Guarding with watchful eye,
"To thee should we cry,
"God save the State."
BELOVED CITIZEN
PASSES AWAY.
In the death of Mr. Roy C. White
the community has sustained an ir
reparable loss. His death which oc
curred on Tuseday at noon, was not
unexpected, and yet the blow was
none the less keen when it fell. The
dence on Oak street Wednesday after
noon at two o'clock, and were conduct
ed by Dr. K. B. Barnefl of the First
Christian church. In a few well
chosen words following the reading of
the scriptures, he spoke of the life of
this just man comparing -him to Bar
nabas of old a good man and true;
a man of faith. And all that Dr.
Barnes said found an echo in the
hearts of those who came to do him
honor.
Mr. White was for many years,un
til his health failed, an earnest work
er in the church and Sunday school,
being one of its most efficient officers.
In his business relations and in his
family he wns ever just and kind;
and as the days and months drew
nearer the end, even so he drew near
er to his Redeemer and was unafraid.
The burial which took place in the
Richmond cemetery at three o'clock.
was attended by a large concourse of
friends, who came with their offerings I
of beautiful flowers to pay a tribute
to his memory..
To the stricken wife and children
all hearts go out in sympathy.
AD PATKES.
I see a man wax faint and old
On the chilly way. O pray
Warm your heart, be kind, I say.
On his way and in the cold
I see a man wax faint and old.
Sad your story, man of old,
Noble soul this day is cold
All your gold away you doled.
You were good and they were bold
Sail your story, man of old.
Gentle mercy, wake, infold
Lonely fleeting man of old.
Chime, 0 church bells, roll and toll
Wake the parson of the soul
Gentle mercy, wake, infold.
Poor old man, how still and cold!
Who ecks xi him, who does cre.
Who gives a tear, says a prayer .'
Gone his way with heart of gold
Poor old nun, how still and cold!

Rapid increuse in total expendi
tures for roads und bridges, growth
of building and maintenance activi
ties under State sunervlsion, and a
sharp decrease in the proportion of
contributions in the form of statute
labor mark the development of high
way work in the United States during
the past 12 years. These facts are
brought out by statistics for the cal
endar year li15, recently compiled by
the Ofhce of Public Koattls and Rural
Engineering of the department.
The total length of public roads in
the United States outside the limits
of incorprated cities and towns was
about 2,452,000 miles on Januury 1
1916. Of this, about 277,000 miles.
or 11.3 per cent, were improved with
some form of surfacing. The mileage
of surfaced roads has been increased
at the rate of about Kl.OIIO miles a
year, and in 1IH5 approximately one
half of this increase was made undor
the supervision of State highway de
partments. In addition, these de
partments supervised the mainten
ance of nearly 52,000 miles of main
and trunk-line roads.
The increase in expenditures for
road and bridge work in the United
SLa'.ys hu-v b?e; frni itn:it"ly
$80,000,000 per year in IV04 to about
$282,000,000 in KM 5, an increase of
more than 2r0 per cent. The expen
diture of State funds during this
same period increased from about
$2,550,000 to more than $53,000,000.
In addition, more than $27,000,000 of
local funds were spent under State
supervision in 11)15, bringing the to:
tal road and bridge expenditure man
aged by the States to $80,514,6!!.
This amount is greater than the total
expenditures for roads and bridges
from all sources in 1!H)4.
The growth in importance of the
State highway departments has been
rapid. The first of these agencies
was created in 1801 in New Jersey,
and now some form of highway de
partment exists in every State except
Indiana, South Carolina und Texas.
Since their inception these depart
ments had expended to January 1,
1010, an aggregate of $205,350,825 in
State "funds for roads and bridge con
struction, maintenance, and adminis
tration. Tiiev had constructed over
r0,000 miles of roads in cn -ope rut ion
with the States, t More than 40,000
miles of these mads were surfaced.
The falling off in the value of road
work performed by statute and con
vict labor was from $20,000,000 in
li'04, when the total road expendi-1
tures was $80,000,000, to about $15,-1
000,000 in 1015, when the total ox-1
penditures had jyrown to $2X2,000,000.
This was a rcd'ji'tinn of 2o per ct-i.t
of the total in the fnrmer year tn less
than 5'ii per cent of ibi total in 1015.
An increase in the better and more
expensive types of roads alM is
liown by recently compiled statistics.
This development has hem' due, in
large part, to the great increase in
automobile traHic. It is est imatcd
