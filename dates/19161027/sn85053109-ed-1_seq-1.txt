Two Dollars Per Year
Good Yield
John Clark Has a
Patch of Fine
Wheat
John Clark must be saluted
as the 1919 Wheat King!
John threshed a patch of
wheat on his ranch southeast
of Baltic this week that yielded
fifty bushels and thirty pounds
to the acre, of fine golden
wheat. The patch contained
eighteen acres. This is the
largest wheat yield so far rec
orded in this section of the
state, to our knowledge. At
current market price, John will
realize a little over $84.00 an
acre from this 18-acre patch.
"My entire crop was very
prood'' said John, as he retreat
ed from an inquisitive repor
ter. "Most of my wheat yield
ed around 40 bushels to the
acre"—and then he was on his
way to the country. One al
most takes his life in his hands
these days in stopping a farmer
even for a moment, They are
all eager to get their work done
while the weather remains fa
vorable.
John had a crop last year
that was a little bigger than
the ordinary. He is one of the
good farmers of the Baltic sec
tion, and by the way, that sec
tion is proving a headliner this
year, in wheat and flax vields.
Satisfying Kn Ambition
John Graham was in town
Saturday to attend the Equity
meeting. John is fulfilling an
ambition he has cherished for
many years: to complete his
high school education, by at
tending high school at Valier.
"I have an ambition for a pro
fessional career" said John to
the writer, and having succeed
ed very well in farming here in
Montana, I now feel that I can
attain the goal I have long
sought." Here is an incentive
for others who have passed
boyhood and who are regretting
lost educational opportunity.
It's never too late if one pos
sesses persistency and ambi
tion.
About twenty five women
of the city were present at the
second meeting of the Parent
Teachers association. Many
matters effecting the interests
of pupils and teachers were
discussed. The next meeting
of the association will be held
on October 14.

been very satisfactory. Mana

fascinating trinkets and prizes
were awarded the children giv

active campaign is being made

as the order has manv excel

rapidly.
The Perrine home was the
scene of much merriment, last
Sunday, when about twenty

her parents and the guests.

neighbors are planning on com

The Sheriffs "Figures"
A Little More Comprehensive Ex
planation Than That Given
By Mr. Miller
William Miller, the democratic candidate for sheriff, is either
mailing to the voters of the county or preparing to mail to them
a letter in which is published a statement taken from the county
clerk's annual statement for the year 1914 and 1915. The com
parative statement for the years quoted is as follows:
Salaries, bailiffs and attendants,
Witnesses.
Jurors
Salaries, wages, including special
Mileage and traveling expensees
Printing, postage, stationery, etc.
Number of prisoners taken to
Caring for insane, including
Board and clothing for prisoner
He (Mr. Miller) says: "You
will note that the above state
ment shows that I saved the
taxpayers of thas county ap
proximately $10,000.00 during
my first year in office."
However, the actual facts in
the case do not bear out the
statemnt of the sheriff. In the
first place, $6,598.20 of the
alleged saving made by Mr.
Miller was for witness fees and
jurors fees and mileage. Cer
tainly the sheriff had nothing
to do with saying who should
or who should not attend court
as a witness or a juror. He
simply served the summonses
handed him by the proper
officials of the county. The fact
that it cost the county in 1914
$4,621.92 to have the witness
attend court, $7.364.40 for the
jururs to attend court, while in
1915 the same items cost respec
tively $3.368.90 and $3.229.30,
is no proof that Miller saved
the money to the taxpayers.
Rather, it proves that in 1914
there were two important terms
of court held, at which time
two murder cases were on trial
one was the Dawes case from
Valier, the other the Johnson
case from Cut Bank. There
were also two rape cases requir
ing many witnesses and jurors.
There have been no important
cases tried during Mr. Miller's
term as »heriff.
In regard to the item of "Sal
aries. wages including special
deputies. $11.865.20 paid in 1!»14
it should be stated that in 1915.
no accounting is made of Salarv
jailor and attendants. $1 .3ti2.70.
Add this to the amount paid in
1915 and the total foots up to
$10.604.59. The county commis
sioners in 1915 ordered that the
salary of ALL deputy sheriffs
be reduced $25.00 per month,
or from $125 paid in 1914 to $100
each month in 1915. Add this
$25 a month to the salary ot the
1914

Cut Bank,
Bynum, Conrad, and elsewhere
in the county it will be seen
that the sheriff did not effect
a saving at all, but rather the
county commisioners effected
the saving, notwithstanding the
efforts of the sheriff to make it
appear otherwise. We are will
ing to give the sheriff's office
credit where credit is due, but
in these instances, at least,
he has no credit coming, and is
attempting to fool the voters
with a lot of misstatements,
which can not be substantiated
bv the actual facts of the case.
He has not saved the taxpapers
approximately $10.000.00, or any
other amount, and certainly he
has no other claim on the tax
payers for a re—election at
this time, unless the many
"escapes" from the county jail
during his administration is
responsible for the saving made
in the item "Board and clothing
for prisoners."

Paying $3,000 for a farm and
more than paying for it with
this year's crop seems like a
pretty big accomplishment,
doesn't it? That is what Ted
Sollom did—and perhaps others
in this section could relate the
same experience. Last spring
Mr. Sollom purchased the Ryan
ranch, not far from his home
ranch. He at once busied him
self in getting it under culti
vation and into crop and the
crop he threshed on this ranch
will more than pay for the farm,
he says. He had several hundred
acres under cultivation and
realized big returns on the in
vestment. "My neighbor, Alex
Johnston is another fermer in
that district who was not afraid
to "take a chance." Last year
he put over a crop that paid
him big returns and this year
his crop will amount to over
$11.000.00." he said.
