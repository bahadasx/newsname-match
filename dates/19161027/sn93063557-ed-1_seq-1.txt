Don't Spend Your Strength in Saving
the Price of a
HOOSIER
Women so often leel that it is economy to do without labor
saving equipment that they try to save the small price of a
Hoosier. When a tew dollars thus invested will systematize
kitchen work so that it can be done easily and in half the time.
Delightful to Work at the Hoosier
You will rind it delightful to sit down at the Hoosier and do
your cooking comfortably. It will help you get good meals
quickly. It will help you tidy up in just a few minutes after
meals.
