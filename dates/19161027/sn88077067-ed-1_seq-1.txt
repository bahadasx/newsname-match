WHAT
A Change, My Countrymen.Has
Come Over Theodore
That They Rush Mlm Through
Ohio Like a Prisoner Bound
for Leavenworth!
(Faulkner, In The Cincinnati Enquirer,
October 22. J
Mention of Mr. Roosevelt serves to
start to ruminating over the changes that
time brings In, especially to Ohio politics,
Theodore is popular In Ohio. In P.I04 he
ume n"ur " "' l'nuM'ratlc
I votes, and in 1912 he surely got a third
of them, after having come within an ace
of beating Tuft out of all the delegates
to the Republican National Convention.
In Cincinnati lives his daughter and his
esteemed son-in-law, Nicholas Longworth
Is a Congressman from that city. Vet this
week he was rushed through that town
like a (tiurantined small-pox sullerer. His
cur was detached from the train out in the
yards, switched on to un engine and r ush
ed across the river Into Kentucky. When
Its safe arrival there was announced
Chuirman l,ouls Cupelle und other dis
tlngiiished Republican Held marshals drew
deep breaths, gave a "whoosh" or two
and remarked: "Well, thank tlod, he got
away!"
The file-bit Ing Democrats, madder than
wet hens, gave way to stark profanity.
They endeavored tl turn out a tsigus
patriotic demonstration headed by a brass
band, march into the railway station and
call upon Theodore for a speech upon the
"atrocities" of the Kaiser. It Is their
persistent charge thot a deal was made
wlh Nalonu! Committeeman Rudolph K.
Hynlcka by the representatives of the
German-American Alliance whereby the
hateful Roosevelt was to be excluded
from the state. Like everything else dis
agreeable that has been said about the
present management of the Guardian of
Prosperity, as Senator Archer calls his
party. It has been officially denied.
Nevertheless and notwithstanding Mr.
Roosevelt, though prayed for intensely by
the Clevelond Progressives, has not been
permitted to bill himself for on address
upon the state of 'the union within the
confines of beloved Ohio. The Democrats
wanted to make this arrangement appear
to have been violated. Hence the band
and the counterfeit sons of liberty. But
some sharp-nosed Republican fox got on
to the game or it was divined by a deep
thinker at headquarters and checkmated
by the simple expedient of changing the
railway schedule. But think of running
Roosevelt through Ohio like a Federal
prisoner on the way to the Atlanta Peni
tentiary! Oh, me, oh, my, and also gosh
nil hemlock!

GRAFTING?
Two eiirs ugo Governor Willis 'politi
cal henchmen charged that T. 1. Riddle
was making u big financial profit In con
ducting the Buckeye Corn Special Tours.
Figures don't Ho. Otlkiul records show
that the tours conducted by Mr. Riddle
cost adults $5(1.26 und boys und girls $16.90
from certain points. This year the Hoard
of Agriculture is now attempting to
cburge udults $60.00 und boys und girls
$."0.00 for tlie sume service from those
same points. Who's grafting now?
WHY THIS MISREPRESENTATION?
In a circular communication Just Issued
the Board of Agriculture claims it has
four tmes us many boys and gris enlisted
In contests this yer us a year ago. This
claim Is contradicted by the record of
eight counties, Allen Auglaize, Mercer,
Miami, Paulding, Putnam, Shelby and Van
Wert, which had an enlistment totaling I
6lil two years ugo and only 4i this year.
Let's huve the enlistment In euch county.
The public is entitled to know what re
sults are being obtained for that $8,000.00
appropriated by the Llglsalture for the
promotion of Junlur Contests.
POLITICAL
Hon. Charles U. Spatz, of Pennsyl
vuui.-i, spoke to Mercer County Germans
at several point tuts week under Demo
cratic County Chuirman James K. Car
lin, speaking again last night ut Chactu
uooKa.anri warmly praised the strict neu
traliiy ol President Wilson undermost
tryuiir conditions. Mr. spatzsaiil:
We American Germans should resent
the attethpt of Republican campaign
managers to use us as catspaws to pull
the chestnuts out of the tire for the Re
publican party. The German vote
should not and will not be handled as i
unit on political questions. The natu
rallied citizen of German extraction is
yal to America, and if need be will
fight for the country of his adoption
against any nation. America first is
our motto. All praise to President Wil
son for keeping us out of war."
Speaking of Mr. Hughes, Mr. Spalz
said: If the Republican candidate for
resident means what he says, ami we
lave no reason to doubt that he does,
he would have declared war against
Germany upon the sinking of the Lusi-
tania. What else could we hope for,
then, in the event of Mr. Hughes' elec
tion, but that this country would become
involved in war with our vaterland as
soon as he had power to declare it."
"But Mr. Hughes will never be Presi
dent," said Mr. Spatz. ' and the Ger
man vote this year will go to President
Wilson, because we are a peace-loving
people and our interests can be best
served by there-election of Mr. Wilson
Mr. Spatz lias been speaking in Ohio
two weeks, and will go from here to
West Virginia. He savs Ohio is no
longer in doubt, but will give Mr. Wil
son no less than 25,000 majority. The
German vote which two weeks ago was
75 per cent Hughes, owing to a misap
prehension, is now less than 5 per cent
Hughes. He predicts an overwhelming
victory for Mr. Wilson in the whole
country. '
The Republicans will endeavor to
arouse a little political enthusiasm in
this city this evening, when the Celina
band will try to drum up a crowd to
listen to national and state issm i dis
cussed by ex-Governor Cbas. Deneen, of
Illinois, and AtlOrnev Gereral Jvd C.
Turner, of Columbus. The meeting will
be held at the opera-house at 7:30 p.m.
Democrats are more or less sour at the
Daily Standard for boosting Hughes for
President through big quarter and half
page advertisements. But it evidently
thinks Wall street money will help pay
office expenses, and business is busi
ness. The almighty dollar causes many
strange bed-fellows.
WILSON DISTRESSED IF POMERENE
ISN'T RETURNED
What is regarded as perhaps the strong
est Indorsement given any candidate by
President Wilson is contained in a letter
to Senator Pomerene.
The president's letter was made public
yestrday by Arthur P. Black, secretary to
the senator. It follows:
Shadow Iiwn, October 23, 1916.
My Dear Senator:
Your letter of October sixteenth grati
fies me very much indeed. It is delightful
to hear of such confidence in Ohio, and 1
am particularly glad to believe, as you
say, "the whole ticket" will be elected,
for it would distress me beyond measure
if you were not returned to the senate.
With warmest regard, cordially and sin
cerely yours.
(Signed.) WOODROW WILSON.
Hon. Atlee Pomerene, Pomere Headquar
ters, Columbus, Ohio.

County Up In Armi Agalnat
G.O.P. Unfair Tactics.
Prompted by u feeling that invitations
received here offering payment of all ex
pense to attend meetings ut the Gibson
Hotel ut Cincinnati on Tuesday und Wed
nesday of tills week, was un Insult to
to them, many prominent Protestant Ger
mans and Catholic Oermans of this city
on Wednesday started In clarculutlon a
dozen different petitions in us muny parts
of the count) deplorig the unfair, unpa
triotic and un-American practices being
Indulged In bytlie oi ganizatlon issuing the
cull, the American Indepenuence Confer
ece of which Joseph Frey, prominent
German Republican of New York City is
the head.
The invitations sent to Germans of this
county was signed ilurk McDonald, of
Chicago and promised payment of all ex
penses for uttendance ut the meetings, the
object of which so the latter stud, was o
rmov any doubt that might exist us to
why eGrmuns should not vote for Hughes.
Despite the hundred or more Invitation
sent to German ciurgy and German lay
men of this county, the only one accept
ing the ivitatioii was Henry Wuchker, Jr.,
of St. Henry.
The move, which Is fostered by German
Republicans, is described us political
trickery and unfair to loyal American
Germans by the prominent local Germans
at the head of the movement tor the cir
Jection of religion and ancestry is wicked
and leads to nothing good," sold Former
Prosecuting Attorney John !. Romer, one
of the prominent FGermuns of this city.
"It should und will react to the authors
and real Americans will resent It regara
less of party nlllllutlon.
The petitions were first circulated here
and prominent bunkers, business men and
lawyers signed them. They were then
circulated over the county, and the first
reports today showed that over three
hundred signatures had already been se
cured. The resolution contained on the petition
is us follows:
Whereas, In the present campaign ap
peals are being made directed to the vo
trs ancstry, creed und prejudices Instead
of facts and reason. And since this is
offending to the Independent habit of
thought. And whereas, this movement is
being made in behalf of the Republican
candidate for president.
Threfore, be it resolved. That we
nieric.in Citizens of German ancestry,
and residents of Mercer county, Ohio, de
ploring of such extreme partisanship, sucb
unfair, nupratrintic and unAmerican prac
tices should be Indulged in, hereby de
nounce this movement as well also of the
circulation of filthy papers injecting such
vile sentiments Into cur natioul cum-
al,rn. Such methods tend to destroy the
peace and good will which should at all
times exist among all citizens of this, the
greatest nation.
Be it further resolved, Tha we the un
dersigned hereby declare our Intention to
vote for the re-election of PRESIDENT
WILSON, for the reason that his high
character of statesmanship and patriot
ism lias been the means of keeping this
country nt peace with all nations, and as
suring to our people an unprecedented
prosper ity. We desire to see the continu
ation of peace and prosperity as well as
a perpetuation of our constitutional gov
