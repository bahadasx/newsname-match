There's No Room for Fifty

(By Review Leased Wire)
CHICAGO, Oct. 26. Chicag'j women
cheered Colonel Roosevelt today when
he appealed to them not to be in
fluenced by the plea that' President
Wilson had kept the nation out of
war. When he told them that he
would fight at the drop of the hat f
necessary to stop the murder W wo
men and children, they met the an
nouncement with a long chorus of ap
plause. '
The Colonel closed his western tou
here today with two speeches, the
first exclusively to women, with not
more than a scant score of policemen
and reporters in the audience. He had
been expected at the hotel to appeal
by the peace slogan but he had de
cided to make exactly the same ap
peal wh.ivh he would have . made to
men. "I am going to speak," he said,
"to what I mght call the early Victo
rian aunt"
Vouches for Hughes.
There was no attempt to heckle the
speaker, the only interruption after he j
described pictures of women and chil
dren killed in Mexico and said he
would have gone to war if necessary
to avoid that, several voices called:
"What about Hughes
Will Prevent Murders.
"Mr. HugbeVi can be trusted to keep
his word," answered Mr. Rctosevelt
"When he says that he would not sub
mit to such deeds as the Finking of
the Lusitania or the killing of our
citizens in Mexico, he: means what he
says. :
Lincoln, Washington Warred.
"You have 'stood up and. listened to
the Star Spangled Banner and to
America and you have stood up be-'
cause they were written about a gen-!
eration of Americans that was not too I
proud to fight. You may notice that i
the expression 'safety first' is not
embodied in either song. And when
you are told to Vote for Mr. Wilson
because he kept us out of war, remem
ber that is something that cannot be
said either of Washington or Lincoln."
Why Troops on Border.
He was interrupted again when he
told of returning from the bbrder.
where he said he found 150,000 troops,,
without knowing what they were I
there for. "Wilson doesn't want them '
to vote," called a woman. i
"I was going to be more charitable
and say that he wanted them there to
help make up the President's mind
whether he was at peace tor at war." '
"The Democratic platform said that
the Mexicans have made war on our
people, the judge advocate general
ruled that the Americans in Mexico
were at war, and our' army is at war,
but Mr. Wilson is at peace."
Hyphenates in Bad.
The women also applauded bis re
ference to hyphenated citizens. "There
is no room in this country for the per
petuation t different nationalities,"!
he continued. "To divide our citizens '
along racial lines is aoral treason to
the republic. To hold for this coun-;
try only half an allegiance is in reali-'
ty to be hostile to this country, ftir ;
in practice when the crisis comes, the :
man whose loyalty s on a fifty-fifty !
basis always shows that his loyalty to '
the other country comes firpt"
Only the brief introduction to the j
address was deoted to suffrage, Mr.
Roosevelt referring to the women as 1
his fellow American citizens and urg-'
ing them to work for the passage of I
an amendment to the federal constitu-1
tion providing for suffrage. He spoke
at a mass meeting tonight.

Attack American
(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, Oct 26. Secretary
Baker issued a formal statement to
night saying that definite information
I had been received by the war depart
j ment that a bandit attack upon Amer-
lean troops in Mexico or on an Amer-
ican border town had been arranged
I to take place between now and elec
i tion day to create sentiment against
! the administration's Mexican policy.
It added that Generals Funston and
j Pershing were forewarned and ar
rangements for attack made.
Exposes PI t
Mr. Baker issued this statement:
"The war department has received
definite information confirmed from
other sources that enemies of the ad
ministration's policy toward Mexico, J
in cooperation with Villa or other i
bandits in Mexico, have arranged a '
spectacular attack to be made either!
upon some part of the American fore-1
es or upon some American communi- j
ty on the border between norv and '
the date of the election, for the pur
pose of turning the tide of sentiment
eainst the policy which the adminis
tration has adopted for the protection
of the border.
With Outside Money?
"It Is significant in this connection
that both the state and war depart
ments were advised that the bandit
forces operating at' the present tir;e
in Mexico are being paid in silver
coin.
"Full particulars have been trans
mitted to General Funston and Gen
eral ' Pershing. All American forces
ire therefore forewarned and in read
'ness for such an attack."
No additional information could be
obtained from Mr. Baker, who left the
city before the statement was made

deliver a campaign speech.

From other sources it was learned
that information concerning a plot
