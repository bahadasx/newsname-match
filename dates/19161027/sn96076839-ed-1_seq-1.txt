BY ALCOHOLISM
ALL HOSFITALS ARE CROWDED
VITH INSANE AND MENTAL
DEFECTIVES FOR CARE.
THE FIGURES ARE STARTLING
Read the Results Found By tho Com.
mission Which Made Its Report
To the Legislature.
'At the legislative seislon of 1913
in act was passed creating a com
mission to investigate the extent of
feeblemindedness, eiilepsy and In
sanity in Michian, to determine their
;auses and to suggest methods
whereby the tstate could deal with
ihese evils. That Insanity, feeble
mindedness and Juvenile delinquency
ire clorely related to alcohollum was
proved by the following extracts taken
from the printed report of the com
aiis?ion which was presented to the
legislature of 1915:
il Could the present day direct in-
fluence of alcohol and syphilis be
A ibolished the state would be relieved
3f the care of nearly a fourth of the
;ases of insanity now yearly admitted
:o the Michigan State Hospitals.
The benelicial effects which would
result In other directions from -the
removal of these two factors alone
ire impossible to more than surmise;
but without doubt there would be a
tremendous lessening in future gene
rations of the insanity which develops
sn the foundation of a defective
aervous and mental organization such
is manic depressive Insanity, epilepsy
ind feeblemindedness.
The Commission is able In this re
port to consider the influence of al
cohol only as )t is a cause or factor
In the production of the cases of in
mnity which are admitted to the
State Hospitals for the Insane.
It should not escape attention that
:he numerous cases of alcoholic in
toxication and delirium tremens,
ivhich are problemes of increasing Im
portance In all communities of tho
itate, arc also due to the effect of
ilcohol upon the nervous system. All
ire mental disturbances due to alco
lol and the cases of insanity admitted
j the State Hospitals give only a
illght suggestion of Its Importance In
,ts relation to the health of the In
llvlduals and the state.
No thorough study of Its Influence
;ould warrant any other conclusion
:han that it Is the most acitve In
luence present In our social life for
:he production of poverty, criminality
ind physical and nervous degeneracy.
Michigan has no institution for the
ipecial treatment of alcoholic habits
r Inebriety. A statute enacted by the
:egislature of 1913 makes it possible
jltals for treatment, but only a small
aumber have been admitted under
;hls act .
In the vicinity of Detroit, two large
lospltals, the Wayne County Hospital
ind St. Joseph's Retreat, annually
reat a considerable number of acute
ind periodic forms of alcoholic In
toxication. Only the more prolonged
forms of alcoholic mental disorders
ind definitely insane conditions due
:o alcohol are treated In any numbers
n the State Hospitals for the Insane.
Dnly exceptionally are cases of deli
rum tremens admitted.
Alcohol was the direct cause of the
nsanlty of ISO Individuals who were
idmltted to the Michigan State Hos
pitals id the year 191314. Alcoholic
nsanlty constituted 8.4 per cent of 1,
f?3 patients admitted during that
period.
The greater proportion of alcoholic
nsanlty comes from cities of larger
population. Those having a popula
tion of 10,000 or more furnish 66 6
per cent of the cases of Insanity due
;o alcohol or drugs.
The Indirect influence of alcohol is'
ihown in the occurence of alcoholism
f more than ordinary degree among
;he ancestors and families of 9.9 per
lent of all cases of Insanity admitted
for treatment.
The comparative frequency of In
lanlty due to alcohol Is considerably
ess In Michigan than In those states
which the population Is largely
Ventered In cities. Alcohol was given
is the sole cause in 13.9 per cent of
.he cases of Insanity admitted to the
State Hospitals for the Insane In
Massachusetts In 1914 and in NeTtr
York 15.1 per cent of the admissions
aere due to alcohol.

'SHELLAC YOUR KIDNEYS"
Dr. Bowers Tells the Beer Drinkers
Some Facts.
A distinguished physician, Dr. Ed
win F. Bowers, recently wrote about
beer as follows:
"We used to think that we got all
the rosin with which we varnished
; our kidney cells from the pitch lining
j of the beer barrels. But now we know
! that we get our kidney shellac from
' the hops In the beer. In addition to
their deleterious effect upon the kid
neys, these secretions act powerfully
and disastrously upon the nervous
cystem.
"Now, the hop belongs to the hemp
group, and Is cjlosely related to In-
dian hemp. On the female blossoms
j of Indian hemp, as on the female bios
, soms of hops, we find glands holding
1 a narcotic. sticky, bitter-tasting
: substance, which is the active element
' of hashish.
1 "Hashish Is used largely by the
j various Mohammedan peoples of West
; and South Africa and in the Malay
Archipelago for narcotic purposes in
the Intermediary stage before com
! plete- stupefaction sets in these hemp
habitues become dangerously violent,
even to running amuck with a huge
crooked-bladded dagger, stabbing and
slashing, until they are mercifully
killed In their tracks."
SUPPRESSING THE TRUTH
Montana Saloon Interests Charged
With Doing It
In a news letter the Montana Anti-
Saloon League Press Bureau says:
"News is being suppressed by whole
sale in this state, and it is being done
by the money of the saloon Interests.
I The anti-saloon people want the pub
; lie informed as to what is going on,
! and we are not so selfish as to insist
j that only one kind of news be pub-
lished,
I . "We are willing that both sides of
this question should be given pub
licity, but the saloon people insist
that nothing shall get Into print that
Is not favorable to them. Our view
Is different. We do not ask the sup
pression of things that do not sup
port our contentions.
""If Bill Jones, somewhefe in the
state, leans up against a soda foun
tain and soaks-himself full of lemon
pop and then goes out In frenzy and
shoots up the town, we won't Insist
that the soda pop business shall be
protected by suppressing this news.
If John Smith goes Into a restaurant
and buys beefsteak after beefsteak,
and than gbes home at daylight as a
result and chokes his wife and cuts
the baby's throat, let the papers print
the facts.
"If. our old friend Brown goes Into
a clothing store Saturday night to
buy a collar and finds the gang there,
and buys them socks and shirts and
ties until his pay check is all gone
and he winds up In. Jail, we won't In
sist on the papers protecting the fair
name of the clothing merchant And
wherever increased happiness and
prosperity and respect for law have
followed the opening of nev saloons,
we'll regard the news as of such in
terest that Wll complain If It IS NOT
published.
"We are perfectly willing 'to be
fair. We are willing to stand for all
(he news they can dig up about the
evil effects of total abstinence if they
will only give us the other side as
well."

Notes -
s May L. Stewart, Commiuioncr
This pnst week has been pretty much
broken up by potato digging, chicken
pox, and various othr contagions pro
fitable and unprofitable. Return trips
will have to be made to the schools
thus afflicted.
If Eveline township still holds the
banner for school progress we must
also yield, a blue ribbon and doff our
caps to Melrose, hour schools of the
five have made wonderful initial im
provement during the past year and
three of the five are candidates for
Standard Plates with the lines well
drawn. ,
Melrose No. ,1, has new seats well
placed, a new hardwood floor, a drink
ing fountain which the director says
they thank the teacher for, and the
blackboard just right for the little folks.
The Easton school has a big problem to
solve but they are working on the mat
ter all the time.
Walloon Lake school now has 18 per
cent one side lighting in the upper
room and 19 per cent side and rear
light in the primary room, a new floor
in the grammar grade room, and new
seats for the primary, a new covered
porch and double roller translucent
shades. Their furnace supplies a
splendid supply of fresh air but they
have still to solve the question of dis
posing adequately of the foul air. This
is the first school in which the teachers
have been able to answer "Yes" to the
question, "Does the school board fur
nish a sweeping compound?"
Clarion school has a new furnace
splendidly installed with hot air regis
ters in side wall, fresh air coming from
the big outdoors' and foul air flues ap
proved by state architects. The child
ren are happy and the teachers tell of
improved school spirit all around. The
buildings are freshly painted in attrac
tive coloYs and the outbuildings screen
ed. s . ,
The Curfew school, Melrose No. 5,
has new seats for the small folks and
the seats all reset absolutely correct.
They have moved the heater to the
opposite corner for imprived ventilation
with a little less smoke, have a splendid
new book case and above all have plans
for the future,.
Bay township schools are enjoying
the potato digging epidemic all but one.
The Horton Bay school was closed
when the Com'r arrived but she was in
time to see unpacked 42 bran new seats
single adjustables with steel frames tne
very best that the American Seating
Co., had in stock. Maybe it is 20 years
since any furniture of this kind has
been seen in this neighborhood but
say it looks as if this district know how
to do things right when they do start.
The director says they are going to
paint the woodwork, too, so the seats
won't be the only improvement of the
year.
M. S. T. A. at Grand Rapids Nov.2nd
and 3rd. Fine inspiration for the
teaching force of our state.
A new "cement approach at Three
Bells.
The Melrose township teacher's meet
ing was held in Walloon Lake on the
afternoon of Tuesday the 17th. Every
one on time but the Com'r and they
made her pretty sorry after she got
there even if she wasa't when Josephus
loitered on the way.
Charlevoix County Teacher's Insti
tute will be held in East Jordan, the
big speaker to be Miss Schreiber of
Boston, Mass., scheduled for Jan. 10th.
She is worth it. Start boosting now.
Two schools in Marion twp., visited
this week.
The Johnson school, Marion No. 3,
has done away with the old platform by
either burying it or using it for kind
ling, and a piece of new hardwood
floor appears in its place level with the
rest of the room plan. The room .has
been tinted too and hts developed a
case of new baseboarditis. Would new
seats in this school help in the appear
ance of the room, or the 'health and
comfort of the pupils?
Marion No. 4, which is the Nowland
school has covered the approach to the
basement, has a new floor and newly
plastered walls. This is a small distric
but we have been given to understand
unofficially that the plan Is to work
every summer for a period of two or
three year?" with the plans carefully
made Any school district following
this plan can get there at tne end of
that time. It is not always the number
of soldiers but the plan, of the general
that wins the fight. Three cheers for
the school board that is working with
an aim in view.
I A number of Hollowe'en Socials are
beinj planned by busy teachers here
and there. ' Among those reported are
those of Deer Lake with Miss Norma
Johnson as teacher, and at Heart Lake
with Miss Ethel Sanford as teacher.
Clarion school teachers, Miss Mary
Hale and Guy Watters conducted a sil
ver medal temperance contest last
Thursday.
