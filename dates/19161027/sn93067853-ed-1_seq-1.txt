FEW OF THE ES
IN P
All Essays Will Be Published
in The Times Before Meeting
of the County Fair?Prizes
Will Be Awarded During the
Fair.
The essays by the school children
and teachers of the county in the
contest for cash prizes will be published
in The Times beginning with
this issue and winding up in the issue
of Nov. 3". The judges will then pass
upon the productions and at the county
fair, on School Day, the prizes will
be awarded. The order in which they
appear in The Times has no signifi- 1
cance. The Times editor has no idea
who will be awarded prizes. Below
we give several of the essays. The '
others will follow next week and the
week following:
The fair builds up the county in J
many ways. , Farmers see better crops,
better animals and better tools than
they have and go home determined to
have as good or better themselves.
The ladies see better things in their
lines and determine on improvement
in their work.
With the girls' tomato clubs and
the boys' corn and pig clubs we children
are encouraged to try to lead.
The Southern Railway gives demonstrations
of improved methods in
various kinds of work. Ladies who
are interested see exactly how to do

to cook on the tireless cooker; to make
good butter, etc., or at least that's
what they tell me.
Then we children have such a good
time in the side shows and such
things.
The school displays and floats interest
us very much.
The horse racing is very exciting
to some, but the motorcycle and automobile
racing is what the boys delight
in.
The poultry show is very interest- ,
ing to most people because everybody
loves chickens in one form or another,
when they see how pretty the
pure -trreWfc they *w ?>w>u?g6fl "
to try some new kinds for themselves.
It is great encouragement to the
boys to see the fine hogs that the pig
club boys raise, to talk to each other !
about different ways of feeding, and
different breeds of hogs.
It is the same way in the corn club.
We can find out about the different
soils, the different ways the land is
prepared, fertilized and cultivated.
This helps us to do better work next
year.
The same thing I suppose applies
to the girls' tomato clubs.
I see that the fair authorities are
going to give every school child in
the county a free ticket for Friday
of the fair. I think that is mighty
fine of them, and I do hope every
child in the county will be there with

they can see the shows. Some of them
have never seen a show in their life
and they will be tickled to death. It
will be the happiest day of their lives
and one they will never forget. I
hope their parents will come along,
too, and find out many ways to improve
their farms and homes.
Let's all meet at the fair and have
a grand, glorious day.

The County Fair is being maintained
each fall for the spenal benefit
of the people of our county. This
Fair is a benefit socially, in that it
brings the people from every part of
our county together; financially, in
that it is an advertising medium and
so enables a farmer to display his
products to a better advantage. It
also enables the ladies to display their
pantry supplies and hand work; intellectually,
in that it is something
of a school for every person that attends.
Our people may read of the
fine live stock and the different products
that are being raised all over
our county, but seeing them in reality
is more beneficial to their minds.
The Fair serves as a boon to the
county at large. It creates a spirit (
of rivalry among the schools and
townships which otherwise would not
o'cist.
I do not wish to leave the impression
that this is the proper spirit that ,
one school or township should have
for another, but the Fair tends to
make each one put forth the best effort
possible.
Taking the foregoing facts into con- i
r.ideration I do not hesitate in the ]
least to say that our people should I
attend the County Fair. i
Irene Vaughan. <

There are a number of reasons why i
the people of Union county should at- i
tend the County Fair.
First, because it is the Fair of our ;
own county and we should do any and '
everything that we could to build up t
I
SAYS
RIZE CONTEST
our own county.
All men and boys should attend because
they will find there exhibited
all the best home raised horses, mules,
cattle, hogs and the best home raised
farm products; and then our women
an J girls should attend because they
will find there exhibited our best
raised poultry and they will find most
everything that can be made with a
needle and will also get some good
ideas in getting up pantry supplies,
an. too, there will be some things made
by the^hands of our grandmothers
and great-grandmothers.
Seeing these things it should be an
encouragement to all and especially
those of us who are young for we
know what others have done we can
do also.
Everybody should attend the Fair
this year for what it has offered on
school improvement if nothing more.
One other reason we should never
be a knocker if we do not like some
tilings tnat are going, out we snouui
be a booster, therefore let's get in
the boosting big, one and all, and have
a jolly good time at the Fair.

A HEROIS PLUNGE
TO SAVE FRIENI)
Earle Harris, son of Mr. W. D.
Harris, plunged into 30 foot water and
saved Charles Purcell, son of Mr. J.
J. Purcell, from drowning at Neal
Shoals last Saturday. Both young
men were with the engineering corps
now working at Neal Shoals. Young
Purcell, while crossing the dam,
slipped and fell below the dam into a
deep pool of water. He could not
swim. Young Harris, seeing his
friend's plight, jumped in to save him.
Both came near drowning, but the
rescuer, after seizing his friend, managed
to swim until he could catch
hold of a rock ledge and both were
hauled up by ropes quickly brought
by workmen. The prompt action of
Young Harris was one requiring great
bravery. He said that he could not
ptand by and see his friend drown
without making an effort to save him.

Hon. Jno. K. Hamblin, resigned

that he could not attend to the duties

duties falling upon him, hence his
resignation.
Mr. Gilbert's friends are pleased to
note his success, and feel that he will
make good.

The capitol was ablaze with lights
1 from tip of dome to cellar. In
front the centre of the broad flight
of steps had been roped off, as had
the wide landing and the plaza down
-? the Confederate monument. A gar1
land of lights hung overhead, like
' great, brilliant stars, and a drift of '
snowy powder covered the asphalt in
preparation for the dance. On every
side packed and crowded the people.
Arrived at Gervais street, the procession
moved around to the hack
of the capitol, the queen and her ,
rourt entering the building from the
rear and passing through to the front
portico. Then, down an aisle formed
by the Roy Scouts with their glaring
torches, to the music of the Harvest
Jubilee hand playing in the open, the
fair ruler-elect over the State's great 1
fall festival was led down the front
steps, preceded by the line of patronesses
and patrons, attended by 1
the four maids and followed by the 1
