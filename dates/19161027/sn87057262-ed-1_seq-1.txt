[United Press Leased "Wire Service!
LONDON, Oct. 27.—British and
German destroyers clashed in a sharp
naval engagement In the English
channel last night, the admiralty an
nounced this afternoon.
The German warships attempted a
raid under cover of the darkness. Two
enemy destroyers were sunk.
It is feared that one of the British
destroyers was lost, the admiralty
added, and another was disabled.
"Last night ten e«amy destroyers
participated in an attempt to raid
the cross channel transport service,''
said the admiralty statement.
^The empty transport Queen was
conk. The crew of the transport
was saved. Two of the enemy de
stroyers were sunk and the rest were
driven off.
"The British destroyer Flirt is
missing and it is feared is lost. The
destroyer Nubian waB disabled and
forced aground.'''
(The naval fight last night is the
first engagement of the war in the
English channel, excepting subma
rine activities, and the first serious
clash between British and German
warships since the great battle off
Jutland on May 31. 1916. German
destroyers and fast cruisers have
made several daring raids in British
waters, approaching near enough to
bombard east coast townB and dart
tag back to port at the approach of
a British warship. Teuton destroyers
also have raided English shipping off
the Flanders coast, taking ships into
Zeebruggee. The destroyer Flirt was
one of the older British destroyers.
She was built in 1897, had a displace
ment of 380 tons and a complement
of sixty-two men. The Nubian was
Sullt in 1909, displaced 985 tons, and
carried normally sevenfyone pfflaers
and men. There are several British
steamers named Queen. It is prob
able that either the 4,958 ton London
Queen, or the much smaller South
ampton steamer of the same name is
meant.]

PLOT EXISTS
TO FORCE
Secretary of War Baker
Charges Conspiracy to
Bring About
Conflict.
WARNING IS SOUNDED
Villa's Bandit Army'ls Paid With Sli
ver, Furnished by Backers
on This Side of the
Border.
[United Press Leased "Wire Service.]
WASHINGTON, Oct 27.—Secretary
of War Baker announced today that
he may have another statement to
make later on his charge that a
plot exists to produce armed conflict
between the United States and Mexi
co.
Administration officials said Baker's
statement was Intended as a warning
to the Mexican government and a gua
rantee of the American government's
good faith. The administration ex
pects the Carransa government to
take final measures for the suppres
sion of the Mexican banditry.
Secretary Bak$r returned today
from Martinsburg, W. Va., where he
spoke last night. The belief of other
administration leaders as well as
Baker's own, was expressed In the
startling statement of last night The
administration by making public its
knowledge of a danger seriously
threatening the relations between this
government and the Carranza govern
ment, expects Caranza fully to realise
this government's unselfish .purpose
a fid in consequence hopes- for more
active cooperation between the mili
tary forces of the two countries for
common action against the Mexican
bandits.
There is reason to believe that should
the Carranza government ignore the
opportunity presented and fall to
bring about a better condition in Mex
ico, the American government will
seriously consider independent action
toward that and.
Baker's statement is also expected
to have an Important effect in check
ing the reported conspiracy on the
American side of the border. While
no definite statement could be ob
tained today, the impression was given
that these conspirators are Mexican
cientiflcos of the Diaz regime and
their egents who have headquarters In
several large eastern cities and in
border towns.
The financing of the Villistas and
other bandits is being done by the
.leaders in the east, through agents
along the border in Mexico. Attention
was first called to the possibility of
the plot by the paying of the bandits
in silver which is scarce in Mexico,
even the government lacking It.
For weeks the war department has
been working upon reports received
from "the interior of Mexico by army
officers, agents of state and justice de
partments and the secret service. The
source of supply of the silver was
traced to the American side of the
border, it is now said.
Officials declare Baker's character

NEW YORK, Oct.

that

T. Burns, Mexican consul general
here, who msule public the following
telegram which had just been re

BERLIN, Oct. 27.—Fleeing Russo
Rumanian forces are evacuating prac
tically all Dobrudja, said an official
statement from the Bulgarian war oi
fice today.
"On the whole front the enemy is
retreating precipitately toward Tul
cea. Bralla and Harsova, pursued by
our forces,' said the statement issued
at Sofia. "Wednesday's capture In
cluded fifteen officers. 771 men and
fifteen machine guns."
[Tulcea lies seventy miles north of
Constanza, on the southern arm of the
Danube and a few miles from the Rus
sian frontier. Braila lies about sev
enty miles north of Cernavoda on the
Danube and Harsova about twenty
five miles northwest of Cernavoda on
the Danube.]
King -Ferdinand dispatched person
al appeals to the rulers of allied na
tions to save Rumania from disaster
after the fall of Constanza, according
to Budapest dispatches.
The mesages were sent following a
stormy session of the Rumanian cab
inet. Rumanian military leaders were
said to have been harshly criticised
by several of the ministers, but sup
ported by the king who declared the
Rumanian defeat was due to the fact
that Russia had failed to supply the
artillery and munitions she had prom
ised.
German military men expect an
early demonstration by the allies,
probably on the Italian and Macedon
ian fronts, in response to King Ferdi
nand's appeal. Because the allied
armies lack sufficient munitions for
great offensives on these fronts, the
attacks are expected to be short lived
and directed largely for the purpose
of encouraging the disheartened Ru
manians.

[United "Press Leased Wire Service]
SAN ANTONIO, TexaS, Oct. 27.—All the commanders of the big army camps along
the border have been warned by the southern department to be on the alert for the attack
or attacks said to be planned by Mexicans. The commanders were ordered to disseminate
the warning to every organization on the bordler. At General Funston's headquarters it
was said no redistribution of the troops would be necessary as the cavalry, artillery and
infantry organizations are so stationed now as to successfully cope with any situation that
might arise.

Are You Registered?
For the next few days the
most important question to
be asked the citizens of Keo

Yesterday was the first of
these registration days.
There are two more days this
week, today and Saturday.
The polls are open from 8 a.
m. until 9 p. m.
After this week there will
be but one more day on which
to register. This is Novem
ber 4. Unless you are reg
istered on one of these four
days, you will not be privi
leged to vote at the Novem
ber election.
Never since the days of
Lincoln were more import
ant questions to be decided
than at the coming election.
Every loyal, patriotic Ameri
can citizen should go to the
polls on that day and exer
cise the right of his fran
chise. He will have a voice
in the election of the next
president of the sited
States, the next governor of
Iowa, the next congressman
of this district and the in
coming public officials of
Lee county.
Every voter is required to
register this year. A failure
to do so on one of the four
days provided for this pur
pose means you will be de

Verily, the meanest and

community is the stay-at
