DANUBE BRIDGE
GONE; TEUTONS
SLACKEN DRIVE
Rumanians Blow Up
Cernavoda Span to
Check Invaders
MACKENSEN NOW
WAITS BIG GUNS
Falkenhayn Gains on
Campolung, but Falls
Back in Moldavia
London, Oct. 26. The double drive
against. Bucharest has slowed down. In
the face of sterner re?istant-e hy the
Russians and Rumanians, Maiken-en in
Dobrudja and Falkenhayn in the Tran
sylvanian line were able to make oniy
slight progress to-day.
The second phase of the Dobrudja
battle seems about to open. Beforr the
Rumaniuns at (ernovoda retreated they
destroyrd the jrrent bridge that
stretched for1 ten miles over thfl Dr.nube
and the swamps that border on it. Thua
before Mackensen can strike for the
railway that runs to Bucharest he must
accomplish the task flf crossing the
river.
Bringing I p Heavy (,uns
Mackensen is bringing up his heavy
guns to renew the battle north of Cer?
navoda. The action BKainst the Rus
sians and Rumanians who retreated
from the Constanza-Cernavoda railway
developed so rapidly that the artillery
found it impossible to keep up the pace.
Military critics here believe that the
Rumanian Rituation, while it is brighter
than it was twenty-four hours Bgfl
carries ncnous problems.
On the western line, where Falken?
hayn is striving to force the mountai-.
pi.sses, the Teutons made progrr
day south of the Prcdcal Pass, toward
Campolung, but on the Moldavian front
the Rumanians strurk a heavy blow
and now- have forced back the invader
to the frontier at almost every point.
Further west, in the Vulcan Pass,
where the German army drove back tho
defenders yesterday, the Bflttlfl is still
in progress. But the Rumanians have
rallied and are battling fiercely for the
southern end of the passagc. The in
vader has not penetrated to the Ru
manian plain.
Pressure Is Rrlaxing
Petroprad reports to-day that tht
German pressure in the Dobrudja is
relaxing. Apparently the Germans have'
checked their efforts to drive into Bes-!
.sarabia abd are concentrating their at?
tention on the crossing of the Danube.
What seems clear is that the invad-1
inj? arflsifla did not trap any large num
bflr of Rumanians at Cernavoda.
some fled over the great bridge thi
fell back northward to join the Rna
sians from Constanzia. Sotia elflifll

which says that Russian tailor- ?!?

Marker.sen's artillery prevrntcd .

dominated the bndge and cut off that j
line of eseape. Tl.e only alternativc |
was (ie-truction of the bridrc aid h rfl

north.
Airships Help .Mackensen
Mackensen has been a^is'ed preut!'.
in this tighting by his flflrflfl and hi? ;
Zeppelins. These BflTflBBed the re?
treating Rumanians and prepared th ?
way for rapid pursuit
The most notable re ;i' "'' tha Rfl

BAKER DENIES
SLUR ON HEROES
Not Sure What He Did
Say, He Admits in
Letter
Alarmed by incrensing nation-wide
itid.gr.ation over Secretary Baker's
comparison of American Revolutionary
Eoldiora with Mexican baadite, the
Demecratic National Committee issued
a long statement in defence of the
Secretary yesterday. The statement
includes BZtracta from a letter written
by the Secretary from Rock Nland, 111.,
and quotea from a speech purported to
hava bet :i dallrerad by Mr. Baker in
Citj a I' ' '..-r IB.
The quoted speech difTers in many
? -s from that actually del
by the Seeratery in Jersey City on that
date, and as a whole is of different
tenor.
The Secretary in his letter admits
BBOt giT* the exact words he used
I ad no notes or manuscript.
"1 did not compare Washington's
soldiers to Villa or ln anv Mexican
i whatever. I did not*a*y thal
Washington's soldiers Mole anything
or that they stole silver out of chu
to buy drink or fnr any other purpose.
"1 did not refer te Washington's *ol
aa 'i.a.j eharaetera1 or compare
them with Mexlcana in any particular;
but. on the contrary, I rafarred te them

"I did aot rofer te aaybody's eharac
'er or BCCBSB anybody, American or
Moxican, of wrBflgB*iBB;. To have done
so would have boail wholly out of ke*p
the argument I was making.
which waa boI basod ob the acts of m
dividuals, but upon the necessary difft
culty of a revolutionary struggle.' ;
"I cannot believa that any or.e will

upon our admiration and an tnspiration j

Mr. Baker in his sp?ech; as taken
down by a stenographer, which he cer
titied as a v, rhat.m account, said:
"Waahiagt tha march

"They drove m.msters of the <io

?JWflda, sUking him if he intended hifl
leharga to Ntlaet oa any Aaatafanon)
citizens, or merely on Mexicana,
"I cannot add to the statement,*
Mr. Baker rep!i-d.
The Secretary waa informerj that
the charge waa seriona, amounting te
treason if applied to Americana, but
he refused to modify his answer,
Text of Statement
The statement follows:
"The War Department has re
ceived defmite information, confirmed
from other source.*, that enemies of
the Adnrinistiation's policy toward
Mexico. in cooperation with Villa or
other bandits in Mexico, have ar
ranired a spectacular attack to ba
made either upon some part of thfl
Ameriean forces or upon some Amer?
iean community on the border be?
tween now and the date of the eleo
tion, for the purpose of turning tbej
tide of sentiment apainst tho policy
wnich the Administration has adoptcd
for the protection of the border.
"It is sijjniiicant in this connectloflj
that both the State ar.d War Depart.
ments were kdrfaod that the bandit
forces operating at the present tima
in Mexico are being paid in silvef
coin.
"Full particulars have been trflnt*.
rrritted to fleneral Funston and Gen
? ral I'ershinjr. A'l Ameriean forcefl
i.re, therefore, forewarned and in
readiness for such an attack.M
Army Offkers Indignant
Army officera denied that any ln?
formation had been received at thfl
War Department through milltarfl'
channels of such a projected Bttarlt,
They expressed the greatest Indignsv
tion at Secretary Baker'a languaga,
which they dedared waa "apparantly
put out for political purpoaea."
"The statement will prove a boorr
erang," one officer declared. "Thfl
Ameriean people will not eountenanca
an implication that Ameriean eitiienfl
for political reaaona would deliberaUlf
Bflfliflt an attack on Ameriean aoldierc
If that ia what Mr. Baker meana -and
I see no other way to interpret it?ll
certainly is not true, and no army offi?
cer would believe it for a minute."
"Such an imputation from Secretary
Baker i? most unfortunate," arother
officer juid, "in vew of his recent ra*
flections on Washington'.* army."
Lanaing Insuea Denial
When Secretary I.ar.sing Icarned la*a
to-night of the effect that Secretary
Baker's htattment had produced hfl
quickly denied that Mr. Baker had any
intention of implicating Ameriean citi?
zens in the bandit plot. He iflid H had
been called to his attention that "aa
effort would be made to construe tha
War Dcpartaaflnt statement as a politi?
cal play and as an a*sault on the Ad
ration's political opponent*."
He denounccd auch a construction aa
absolutely ta
?'Politics were not given a thought in
connection with the matter," he said.
"It is inconceivable that any Amerieaa
would ally himself w.th Mexicans tfl
attack hia own countiymen "
The statement was issued. he de
clared, in the belief that in addition
to the wartung to the Ameriean forcea
on the border the public should be in?
formed of the plot, and that publicav
ton miK'ht cuuse the plot to be aban
doned.
