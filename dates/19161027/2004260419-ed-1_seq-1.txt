NO. 45
COUNTY GRAND JURY
MAKES THEIR REPORT
SUBMIT THEIR VIEWS
Advocate Abolishment of Koadmus
ter's Office.
To the Honorable Circuit Court of
Columbia County, State of Oregon:
We, your grand jury, beg leave to
report as follows:
That we have examined the sev
eral cases of persons having been
bound over by the justice courts in
tho several districts of the county.
Wo have also examined charges
against other persons and individu
als for the commission of misdemean
ors to which our attention has been
called, and have fully examined those
several cases where we had cause to
believe that a crime had actually
been committed, and where we be
lieved the good of tho community
demanded an examination, all of
which the several bills and indict
ments, we have reported to your
court.
We have also examined into the
case of one Velma Young, who la a
person of feeble mind, who resides
alono with her father, and wo find
from the testimony, that we have
had, that she is a person who should
not bo allowed to remain alone, and
act In company with some other fe
male person, and we earnestly re
commend that the county court of
Columbia county will take immedi
ate steps to have said Volma Young
placed" in the Institution for feeble
minded at Salem, Oregon.
We have examined the various of
fices occupied by the various officers
of the cohnty, and we find they are
all kept neat and orderly, and the
bbilding appears to be in good condi
tion. We also called at the office of the
roadmaster, and we believe that this
office is unnecessary, and therefore
recommend that the office of road
master be discontinued and the work
now done by the roadmaster be trans
ferred to the office of the county sur
veyor.
Wo also recommend that repairs
be mado upon tho vault on the north
side of tho basement of the court
house, that ventilation may be se
cured therein.
We recommend, too, that a good
and substantial table be placed in the
grand jury room in tho basement of
the courthouse.
We, have also examined the poor
farm nnd its surroundings.
We have, however, no recommen
dation to make.
We having now completed the
business before us we ask that we be
discharged from further service at
this time. .
Dated at St. Helens, Oregon, this
17th day of October, 1916.
