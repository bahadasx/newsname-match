IT SHOOK HIS NERVES.
Incident That Made a Man Fee)
Queer For Awhile.
"One niht' said a lawyer, "
was preparing some tedious plead
ings which had tofhe submitted tc
court the following morning, and,
knowing that I would need every
moment of my time, I locked my-
aelf in a email private- consul tatiou
room in the rear of my suit, whero
no choncc caller could interrupt mc
The room is very diminutive, wilii
only one window, looking' into
court, and no furniture except '
table and two or three chairs. Wo!;
I worked on steadily hour after
hour long after the city had bcüIM
into sleep and silence. The buihi
ing was so still I could hear even n
occasional mouse scamper acro.--i
the floor alone. At last I conclude!
the tak and, sitting erect in
chair, began to stretch my cramped
limba.
"As I did po my eyes happened
to fall on a lighted cigar stump ly
ing on the carpet not four feet
away, and I stopped stock still fro
zen with amazement. I do not
smoke. T had been sitting for hour:
in that little locked room. I couh?
swear that no one had entered. Th
window was tightly closed, yet then
right at my feet lay a half con
umed cigar with a great live cor. I
till glowing at the end. It seen '
ridiculous to confess, but a thrill ur
horror ran through me like a gt'
vanic shock. tA hallucination of nr
kind is an appalling thing; it mak
no difference how grotesque r
homely the subject. It carries su. i
frightful suggestion of breakdor-i
in one's rcntal engine room-
"Well, I finally summoned wq
enough nerve to stoop down and
amine the tump, and what do v
think it woj? Why, a tin foil c.i.
ule from the top of an ordirr
quart bottl of mucilage. In sh
ping it off it had assumed thn .?
ciliar twist of a cigar and, tho f'r
being bron, was just the right
or. The rd se-al at the top forr.
the coal, and yard or so pway
illusion was perfect. I dre.- a dt-r.
breith of relief, but it was nctur.v
several days before my nerves -turned
their Lormal tension
