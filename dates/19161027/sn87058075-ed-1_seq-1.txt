Next Big Attraction at Opera House.
Fiske O'Hara, under the direction
of Augustus Pitou, will present his
new romantic comedy, "HisJ Heart's
Desire," at Cresco, on Saturday even
ing, November 11th, written by the tal
ented authors, Anna Nichols and Ade
laide Matthews. Ever since the favor
ite singing actor's name appeared as
a star in the theatrical firmament, his
annual visit is looked forward to by all
lovers of clean and dignified plays, and
especially by the descendants of the
Celtic race, as the theatrical event of
the season. The talented actor-singer
is the possessor of a superb rich tenor
voice, besides being an actor of un
equalled talent. Last season was the
banner one of his career. In New
York at the Standard Theatre he broke
all box-office records, which is the best
proof of any artist's popularity and
success. He is heralded again this
season in what is pronounced as the
best romantic comedy ever written,
inasmuch as the role of the dashing
young Irishman—Larry O'Neil—is just
apart wherein the distinguished actor
is best suited for displaying his talent.
The play is brining over with spark
ling wit and extremely funny situation.
The whole story built around Larry O'
Neil is sweet and refreshing. He ar
rived at the home of Mollie McGarry
quite unexpectedly. He is pledged to
marry Mollie according to tlie will of
his grandfather, though he has never
seen her. Mollie is quite a spirited
Irish girl and resents deeply the
thipught of being married to a man not
of iher own choice, hnd determines to
avjtid him. Larry falls in love with
her at first sight, Mollie believing him
to ibe only the- secretary of his chum
Lord Hereford, and taking the young
Lord for Larry, whom she has never
seen before, falls in love with the man
she was so determined not to. Larry,
by clever maneuvering, keeps up the
deception until he wins her love. Run
ning through the entire play is another
charming romance, that of Norah and
Lord Beresford, to the great chagrin
of Lady Alice O'Neil, Larry's aunt,
who has made up her mind to trap Lar
ry for her daughter Norah.

Ridgeway and Charles Hornberger, re
siding at home, together with [about
100 neighbors and friends joined in|the
celebration.
The family circle has never been en
tered by death and at this celebration
a^ happy feature was the gathering to
gether of the whole family for the}first
time in twenty years.
Mr. and Mrs. Hornberger^were mar
ried in Dearborn County, Indiana, re
siding there 18 years before ^coming to
Iowa where they settledJ[on] the farm
which has been their home for*32 years.
The neighbors came to surprise this

Rural School Notes,
The regular October teachers' exami
nations are held at the Court House at
Cresco, Wednesday, Thursday?and Fri
day of this week.
The first study center meeting of the
year will be held at the Cresco High
School, Saturday, Oct. 28th. Prof. C.
A. Fullerton will show the teachers
how to use the Victrola in the rural
schools. A Victrola is of much more
benefit in the rural school than an
organ, and the interest that many
of the teachers have already shown in
the Victrola demands that the best
method of using it be known. Prof. C.
A. Meyerholz takes for his subject,
"The Relation of Civics Teaching to
Citizenship." To study civics is of lit
tle value unlets it makes better citi
*How stall we teach it tanwdml
it^pvfcr to life? Any who are inter-
eated in this work will be welcomed at
the meeting Saturday. The program
begins at 10 -a. m.
Copies of Mrs. Lilla G. English's
books are now in this office and can be
supplied to those who could not get
them when Mrs. English was here.
For SiperriMr in Wianesbiek.
The democratic candidate for super
visor in the weat district of Winneahiek
county is Chas Kyan of Fremont town
ship. The Decorah Journal writes of
his candidacy aa follows:
"He is 36 years of age, young enough
to be energetic and active, and old
enough to have sound judgement. He
and has been deeply interested in the
public affairs of the county, especially
the matter of road building and main
taining. Fremont twp. has not fur
nished a county supervisor since Rich
ard Barnes, who was elected in 1881.
It appears fair and proper that Fre
mont twp. should be recognized at thia
.time. The voters of the district may
feel sure that if they elect Charles
Ryan, he will give to them painstak
ing, conscientious service."

Reaaikable Operatise.
Mrs. W. J. Miller, of Lime Springs,
underwent an operation at the hospital
in this city some days ago for gall
stones. Her son. Dr. T. E. Miller, and
a specialist, Dr. WejIan, both of Chi
cago, performed the operation. The
gallstone removed was more than two
inches in length and about an inch and
a half in thickness, and was a perfect
egg shape. Dr. Weylan pronounced it
the largest he had ever seen, and said
it would take several hundred of the
gallstones usually found to make one
the size of this.
Mrs. Miller is recovering nicely from
the operation.—Decorah Journal.

Little Girl Killed by Auto Near Elmt.
Last Wednesday evening while Marie,
Gardner, only daughter of Mr. and Mr?^
Wm. Gardner, living northeast of town..
was returning hoole from school in com-,
pany with several companions she was
hit by an autonioble and instantly kill-,
ed. It seems that two automobiles
were passing each, other and the child
ren had separate^.into two groups, one
on either side of the road, to let the
autos have the right of way. After
one car had passed Marie, who wad
only six years old, darted across tho
road to join a girl companion on the
other side and in doing so ran direct
ly in front of the on coming car which,
was not traveling at a high rate of
speed. The accident is a most deplor
able one and the grief of ttie parents
must be profound. No blame is at
tached to the driver of the car and Ise
of course feels deeply shocked at the
unfortunate circumstance that made
him a participant in the tragic affair.
Marie was a bright, lovable little
girl, the pride and joy of contented
parents whom fate has led to the brink
of despair, but we have confidence, the
courage and faith of these good people
will enable them to bear their cross of
sorrow with Christian fortitude and
that their hours of reflection may be
enriched by the memory of the little
one whose soul in its childish innocence
and purity has joined the annointed
ones of heaven.— Blma New Era.
