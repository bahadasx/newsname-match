BAKER EXPECTS BANDIT ATTACK
IB II. S. BWETI HI
Secretary Says His Information Is That Attack-Will Be
Made for Purpose of Creating Sentiment Against
the Adniinistration and Causing Defeat of
Wilson Information Is Vague.
BV ASSOCIATED PRESS.
WASHINGTON". D. C, Oct- 27.
Official Washington was still
commenting today on the an
nouncement of secretary of war Baker,
issued Thursdav night, that definite in
formation had been received that an at
tack by Mexican bandits, either on the
punitive expedition in Mexico or on an
American border town might be expect
ed before the national election in the
United States for the purpose of dis
crediting the Wilson administration.
The secretarv added that both Gens.
Funston and" Pershing had been fore
warned of such an attack.
War and state department officials
refused to disclose the source or specific
nature of tie information on which sec
retary Baker's statement was based.
They said the channel of information
was so valuable that nothing would be
given out that might injure its useful
ness.
Both secretary Lansing and secretary
Baker today laid stress on the statement
that no consideration of domestic poli
cies led to the issue of the announce
ment that snch a plot had been discov
ered. Secretarv Baker declared it was "ab
surd" to sunuose that his statement had
been intended to imply that any polit
ical interest in the United States de
sired anything other than peace on the
border.
Baker's Statement.
Mr. Baker issued this statement:
"The war department has received
definite information, confirmed from
other sources, that enemies of the ad
ministration's policv toward Mexico, in
cooperation 'with Villa or other bandits
in Mexico, have arranged a spectacular
attack to be made either upon some part
of the American forces or upon some
American community on the border be
tween now and the "date of the election,
for the purpose of turning the tide of
sentiment against the policy which the
administration has adopted for the pro
tection of the border.
"It is significant in this connection
that both the state and war depart
ments were advised that the bandit
forees operating at the present time in
Mexico are being paid in silver coin.
"Full particulars have been transmit
ted to Gen. Funston and. Gen. Pershing.
All American forces are therefore fore
warned and in readiness for sneh an at
tack."' Ho Americans Involved.
Secretary of state Lansing Thursday
night authorized the statement that sec
retary Baker had no intention to inti
mate that American citizens were in
volved in the bandit attack plot. The
secretary said that it had been called to
his attention that an effort would be
made to construe the war department's
statement as a political play and as an
assault upon the administration's nolit-
ical opponents. He denounced such a I

VILLA BAITS
MOVE TO SATEVO
More Interested In Our Election Than Americans Themselve
construction as absolutely talse, declar
ing that politics were not given a
thought in connection with the matter
and that it was inconceivable that any
American would ally himself with Mex
icans to attack his own countrymen.
From other sources it was learned
that information concerning a plot had
been received through agents of the de
partment of iu'tice. state department
representatives on the border, and also
through some other channel which has
not been disclosed.
It is stated on reliable authority that
Mexican interests in the United States
are believed t.- be directly responsible
for the conspiracy with bandits across
the border.
The department of justice is pressing
its investigation. As yet. it is stated,
there is not sufficient evidence avail
able against any individual to warrant
his arrest and prosecution. Attorney
general Gregory indicated that such in
formation as had been laid before him
was of vague and inconclusive charac
ter. Baker Holds Conferences.
The war secretary is known to have
received the information on which he
based his statement Thursday on his re
turn from a campaign trip that has kept
him out of the city several days. He
conferred during the day with secretary
Lansing and other state department of
ficials, attornev general Gregory an1
held long conferences with. Gen. Scott,
and other officers ot the war department-Money
Sent to Villa.
For some days vague intimations that
an attack of some sort along the border
might be in prospect have been reach
ing the state department. Up to today
they -have been so indefinite, it U un
derstood that officials were not inclined
to treat them seriously. There wcre no
dues on which to start an investigation.
It has been known for some time also,
that Villa, or whoever the bandit ehief
tain may be who is operating against
Carranza garrisons under that name,
has had a considerable supply both of
silver money and ammunition, smug
gled over the border from the United
States. The reference in secretarv Bak
er's statement to the fact that Mexican
bandits are known to have been paid
recently in silver, is thought to have
been founded upon those reports.
Arcedondo Partly Confirms.
F-liseo Arredomlo, Mexican ambassa
dor designate, when sltowu secretary
Baker's statement, said he had heard in
timations when he returned from Mexico
two weeks ago, that a border raid plot
bv intervention interests on both sides
of the liorder was beins worked out. He
said he had promptly informed Gen. Car
ranza. who telegraphed in reply that
troop movements to prevent such an oc
curence had been ordered.
"I understand." Mr. Arredondo added.

While he admitted having no definite'
information as to the possibility of a
raid on the border by Villistas. he said
he ha1 been informed such a raid
might be made at some Isolated point
between El Paso and San Antonio. He
said he had information that Mexiaan
silver pesos were being purchased here

and expressed an opinion that these
coins were being smuggled across the
border for Villa to pay his men. the
bandit leader having promised them

Mr. Garcia also stated his agents had

junta here and had reported to him
that efforts had been made in the past
to send representatives of this junta
to Villa from the border with instruc
tions as to hin movements.
Mr. Garcia's departure for Jew York
at this time is believed to have a di
rect bearing on the present situation
on the border. He declined to make
known the purpose of his mission
which, he said, was confidential, add
ing, however, that it would be in the
interest of peace in Mexico.

State Department Gets In
formation Showing Eng
lish Effort at Domination.
Washington. D. C. Oct. 27. The state
department has concluded an investiga
tion showing that Great Britain has
built up a series of con ti acts to which
importers of many raw materials must
submit. This discloses the extent to
which American trade is dominated by
Great Britain and reveals, according
to treasury officials, tne applicabillty
in this connection, of paragraph S62.
of the revenue bill which had appar
ently escaped notice.
Treasury officials indicated that the
legislation would be applicable imme
diately. Its provisions, they said are
mandatory and not discretionary as
with the other retaliatory acts. The
first, legislation which has been pafeed'
to protect American trade after the
war and which was aimed, strangely
enough, some officials pointed out, es
pecially at the German dye importers,
would seem to apply during the war
against the British.
The department can act only in the
cas'e of each individual importation and
tn en only on proor tnat tne law Das been
violated. So far. it is said, no com
plaints have been received.
