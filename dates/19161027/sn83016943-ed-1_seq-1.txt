Prohibition in Mississippi has
taken a queer turn. The only
real an i simon-pure prohibition
in the state now is against the
freedom of the press in publish
inar advertisements. The legis-
lature which recent'y adjourned
enacted a law which prohibits
the sale or circulation of any
newspaper or periodical which
carries an advertisement of any
alcoholic liquors. The prohibi
tion of sale and use of liquors
does not go so far. The law per
mits the importation of two
quarts of whiskey or twelve
quarts of beer for each adult
citizen every four weeks. The
people may buy and use - liquors,
but they may not read advertise
ments to guide them in how and
wnere to buy, or what should be
the market price. They may
send to New York or New Or
leans an order for these goods,
which are not contraband in the
state, but they may not read an
advertisement giving them in
formation about wdat they are
to order or what price they are
to pay.
The' people of Mississippi have
long resented the old history of
that state, written by northern
men, to the effect that they pro
hibited the circulation of knowl
edge among the slaves, but the
new law against advertising of
lawful goods is prohibition of
the ci rculation of information to
the white people as well as totho
negroes of the state. There
might be some consistency in the
laws of Mississippi if the prohi
bition of the liquor traffic went
as far as does the prohibition of
advertising. But as these laws
now stand, they are absolutely
inconsistent, and more against
the freedom of the ptess than
the prohibition of the liquor. It
might be chargod that the Miss-1
issippi legislative was influenced
by a boot-leggers' lobby, for it
'apDears that fue legislation
benefits the boot-leggers, who
sell liquors without special brands
or a schedule of prices, taking
advantage of peoDle as to quality
and prices. What man is so ig
norant that he cannot under
stand the farce of a law which
prohibits him from reading
about what the law says he ha3
a right to buy and use? Wash

Scarcity of Cotton Seed for
Planting Purposes
Good, early, plantjug cotton
seed promises to be'scarce next
ppring, especially in the large ter
ritory where the weevils got in
their worst work this season. The
mill price being high, and cotton
scarce, not enough seed is being
held in many localities to plant
the next crop, The Cleveland big
boll seed is especially going to be
in demand. This variety has
shown up well for several years
and this year has given especially
good results as a cotton to plant
under boll weevil conditions. The
Htate Experiment Station places
it in the first rank as an early
variety. On Mississippi prison
farms it made larger yields than
any other variety this season. It
has shown up well among grow,
era in nearly every part of the
state. .We would suggest that
all people having this variety
where it nas produced well, save
it carefully and if they will re
port to us the quantity they have
we will be able to put them in
connection with those who wish
to buy. There are some inquiries
now, but there will be little trade
before the beginning of the year.
Some varieties, as Triumph, Mil
ler Big Boll, and Cook's Improved
class up very well, and in view
of the promised scarcity we would
suggest saving some planting seed
from your crop regardless of name,
as they may be needed. J. F. Mc
Kay, Marketing Specialist, Miss.

Every wife and mother, yea, and
every sweetheart, of Macon, as well
as the fathers, sons, and husbands,
should let it be known that they are in
favor of prohibition, and opposed to
the repeal of the present anti-liquor
law, until we can get a Btill more pro
hibitive one.' The curse of drink is as
old as sin, and has sent billions of its
victims to drunkard graves and drunk
ard eternities, caused more tears,
broken more hearts, and ruined more
homes than any other known evil.
Whiskey costs Mississippi over one
million dollars a year, and our country
over two billion dollars a year, and
has been sending nearly one hundred
thousand of our young men to dark,
hopeless graves.
It has helped to tend nearly 60,000
poor, hopeless, godless, heartbroken,
bedraggled wives and daughters to
sunless eternities. The war between
the states cost about one million lives.
Since then, drink in our country has
killed nearly four million. It is well
known that whiskey is the cause of 85
per cent of the crime of this country.
It is said that in the state of Kansas!
where no liquor is allowed to come in
the state, that its people have more
money per capita than any state in
our country, and its jails and prisons
are practically empty. It is said that
there is more drinking in the city of

Charging that "the outrageous

graft," the Kosciusko Herald
says: "It is time for someone con

least to get an explanation of them
from those to whom was delegated
the authority to make the pur

has been made and goes unchal

on the Centennial Exposition.

'em,-Coirsicrc:al-Appeal. J Prairie Point, Miss,
According to dispatches from
London, the British government,
impressed by the necessity of
making good that wastage of re
cent campaigns, is about to bring
Ireland within the purview of the
compulsory service act. Advo
cates of this step contend that
the Emerald Isle, as a whole, has
fallen far short of her quota, un
der the voluntary system. In
other words, it is considered that
Ireland has shirked, despite the
superb deeds of valor which
Irish regiments. Nationalists as
well as Ulsterites, have
done in all theaters of the conflict.
We doubt very much whether
the record would support this
charge, even in the purely sta
tistical sense. But the charge is
manifestly false, from another
standpoint. Before an individual
or a race, can truly be said to
shirk, he (or it) must have a
manifest duty to perform and
shrink from the performance,
through cowardiee or slackness.
To accuse the Irish of cowardice
would be absurd, even in Tory
circles. Why, then, has Nation
alist Ireland bovtotted the re
cruiting sergeant of late, de
spite Mr. Redmonds appeals? It;
was not so in the earlier stages
of the struggle; it would not be
so today unless something had
happened to chill Nationalist
loyalty.
Alas, the record proves that
many things have conduced to
the sinister change. In the first
place, it has been shown that
British troops wonld not be used
against Ulster, though they were
used with every circumstance of
fnghtfulness against the binn
Fein revolt. And, as home rule
has been hung up for the period
of the war, it is natural to be
lieve that the troops will be used
to repress any home rule move
ment after peace comes. Nation
alist regiments have seldom, il
ever: betii Hif.iitioi.'ed it; t-e enV
cial accounts of battles upon
which the fate of the empire mani
festly hung; from which it is fair
to iiifer that the empire does not
value Nationalist lnsnmen, ex
cept' as food for shrapnel and
poison gas. And the executions
which rounded out the army's
fierce work in Dublin left no pos
sibility of mistake as to the spirit
that will pervade British policy,
in peace as in war, if the Tories
continue to sway the Coalition
cabinet, or the vicissitudes of
politics enable them to eject the
Liberals altogether. In such cir
cumstances it is not at all strange
that Nationalist Ireland's original
enthusiasm should have fallen to
zero; no self respecting people can
afford to ignore repeated slaps iu
the face. Would the Boers be
found supporting the imperial
cause without stint if Sir Henry
Campbell - Bannerman had not
been wise enough to give them
home rule on the very morrow of
conquest! Would Australia and
Canada be draining themselves ol
blood and treasure if the mother
land had continued to rule them
as crown colonies!
The Atlantic monthly for Oc
tober contains a striking article
on our diplomatic relations with
England. As the article shows,
our relations with England have
been sunny, or the reverse, ac
cordingly as the Liberals, or the
Tories, happened to be in the
saddle. As the author says, it is
a question whether America
would have revolted if Charles
James Fox, instead of Lord North,
had been George Ill's premier
when the controversy over colon
ial taxation became acute. It was
Lord Salisbury, a Tory of Tories,
who brought America and Eng
land to the verge of war by the
supercillious fashion in which he
pigeonholed Mr. Olney's protests,
on Venezuela's behalf. In each
case it was Tory hateur and lack
of imagination that created the
crisis. And it is Tory hauteur
and lack of imagination that pre
vented an Irish settlement along
the lines which a Liberal premier
leader laid down iu South Africa.
Let Ireland be treated as South
Africa was treated and she will
keep her regiments full, without
the shadow of compulsion; let
South Africa be treated as Nation
alistic Ireland has been treated
and the Boers would again
slaughter the ;Kooineks" with
out remorse, Toryism is simply

Our Dollar Bo
Max Iloschiller, a financial
authority, in an article in the
Temps, declared that the Ameri
can dollar is boss of the financial
world, and proceeds to prove it.
As an indication of how the
United States has pushed herself
to the front financially, the writer
says before the war the United
States was sending to Europe from
$200,000,000 to $300,000,000
yearly in interest on its borrow
ings, 150,000,000 to $200,000,000
spent by tourists, 100,000,000 to
150,000,000 to expatriates and
20,000,000 to $40,000,000 in
oceau freights.
Siuce the war, the United
States has imported $730,000,000
iu gold and has paid back a con
siderable amount of its previous
borrowings, increased its foreign
trade by $2,250,000,000 yearly
and loaned to foreign countries
$1,470,000,000, so that the dollar
now has replaced to a consider
ble extent the old sovereinty of
the English pound abroad.
Whether the United States will
retain, with her deficient finan
cial organization, the position re
cently won, will depend upon
American financial policies. The
arrival iu France of an American
commercial mission is an indica;
lion that Americans are realizing
they must follow the law in ex
changes. Nor is that all; the United
States has found out that many
things it once considered necessi
ties were only luxuries, and that
it was quite possible to get aloug
without them. It has also
learned that other countries w ill
buy our products just as quick
as they will those of Europe, if
we only oiler them what they
want at prices they want to pay,
and from now on we intend to do
it.
In many respects Americans
have suffered from the war in
Europe, but in other ways they
have profited, and one thing we
have learned is that we are of
much more importance than we
believed.
