Mark Hannas Venerable Ghost Begins
Its Quadrennial Stalk in South Bend
And Mishawafca Waving Calamity Banner
MARK H ANNA'S "Jiost the venerable "lull dinner
rail" of 1896, filled with intimidation and fear, is
makin? its quadrenniel stalking tour, arriving in South lien 1
full blat, and with quite as much, if not more adulterated
display, than that which marked the recent arrival of the
Hughes "Hillion Dollar Special" laden with silken petti
coats. Instead of the feminine caste of Wall st., however, this
time it is James Eli Watson of Col. Vvulliall fame, and old
time emissary of the National Association of Manufacturers,
both on the iloor of congress and in the lobby.
The way has already been prepared for him.
To "Protect Your Job, Choose Hughes" beaming into
the face of every vorkingman who can afford to ride a
street car to and from work;
The distribution of widely prevaricating and semi-threatening
tarilT literature through the factories, under the dis
guise of its being furnished by the so-called "American Pro
tective TarilT League," though the least slip of democratic
literature could not be pried in with a crowbar;
Calamity articles, comment and advertisements, appearing
in the local republican press
These are all well calculated to prepare the timid, the un
thinking, uninitiated, gullible, weak-spined scare-babies, to
grab the nipple held out by the National Association of
Manufactuiers' wet-nurse and swallow the whole nursing
bottle.
The proffered superstition is that by so doing they can
escape the goblins that lurk just aroiind the corner.
The question is, will labor ajrain consent to being brow
beaten, bully-ragged, humbugged, soft-soaped, driven,
drummed, or even bought for a pittance, into going to the
polls on election day, and there, contrary to its best intel
lectual and moral sense, vote to return to'political power an
aggregation of economic, monetary and industrial porch
climbers, to whom the workingman never has been, and
never will be anything other than a "goat" to be kicked
about for its folly, from the moment that the polls close?
' The reason for this determined intimidation of the work
ingman in South Bend, in Mishawaka, and throughout the
state and nation, is obvious.
The republican party, and its candidate, Mr. Hughes, are
by this time well aware that all the other trumped-up issues
that they have tackled, have fallen flat with the people.
At first it was the Mexican situation and Pres't Wilson's
European policies that they were determined to grab off the
popular vote with; then by attacking the child labor law,
the seaman's act, the federal reserve bank law, rural credits,
and Adamson eight-hour law but throughout it all, it has
been a floundering, struggling, bluffing, gulfing, but well
resented mess.
The hallabaloo about Mexico was conjured up tc get the
backing of the Wall st. interests in the way of fat campaign
contributions; this supplemented bv the thought that per haps
by mollycoddling the Catholfc clergy which is much
exercised over the Catholic situation beyond the Rio Grande
where revolutionists of Catholic faith have been ravishing
Catholic nuns and destroying Catholic church property
they might through such clergy, force the solid vote of'the
American Catholic people.
They spent $35,000 for a movie film with which to cap
ture this support, and then learning that Protestantism, and
as well lay Catholicism, had discovered that Mexico has
been Catholic country for four hundred years, with the Mex
ican people Catholicised and Protestantism so completely
eliminated tlv.it the ravishers and church-burners, were of
themeslves merely evidence of Mexican Catholic ineffi
ciency in spiritualising, civilizing, and in bringing justice
without revolt to its own people; well, the republican na
tional committee concluded that it would about as soon have
some Protestant votes as only part of the Catholic, and the
film was shelved.
We have heard less about Mexico since then, but more
about Europe. Driven to the wall, Mr. Hughes next under
took to square himself by telling us what he would have
done in the case of the Lusitnnia. He would just have
threatened Germany and the Lusitania would never have
been sunk some wondrous threatener. Evidently the re
publicans hope to prevent the reelection of Pres't Wilson
by much the same process; threatening, cajoling, brow-beating,
and bully-ragging the workingman, with street car and
press Mattahcy and "American Protective Tariff League"
literature the literature of another of those republico-la-dies
aid societies, something of the O'Leary American Inde
pendent league variety.
a
Next it was the child labor act, the seaman's law, the re
serve bank, rural credits, and the Adamson bi." but no
where, has the G. O. P. found a leg to stand on. Desperate,
but as close to tiie tough as election day, it is but natural
that, having fell tlat on its tiat issues, it should dee'de to re
sort to force, corruption, intimidation, anything and it is
in such straits that old Mark Hanna's ghost always walks.
The protective tariff is the big bogy; the money-bag, the
big bait; calamity, not here, but-lurking just around the cor
ner and waiting for the end of the war, is the big howl.
It is the last resort. The "Copperheadism" that marked
and still marks the republican attitude toward the president
and his Mexican and European policies; the plutocracy
which has inspired a quite equally venomous attitude toward
democracy's internal and humanitarian achievements are
now merely casting aiide their disguises and stepping forth
in their full hideousness.
Republican leaders know that the brains of labor is
against them. They know hat the real intelligence and
humanitarianism of the country is against them. They are
aware that they have humbugged none, and that dependent
upon the intelligence and patriotism of the people, they will
get nowhere. Anti-democratic prejudice, and the promo
tion of fear, perhaps monetary corruption, and appeal t
scare-crow impulses, have accordingly been placed on the
regular order of business.
The question is, Mr. Workingman, or whoever vou are;
are you going to discard your brains and vote voür preju
dices; are you a scare-crow, subservient to fear,"or are you
so low down that your vote can be bought?
The republicans" evidently think that a lot of people in
South Bend and Mishawaka, are at least one, if not all of
these.
We don't.

Ii.teruatlnal News Servirp;
WASHINGTON'. Oct. 27. Com
plete denial that any Americans
were implicated in the alleged plot
to embarrass the Wilson adminis
tration by engineering an attack
either upon American civilians or
American border towns, between
now and election day, was made hy
iSec'y of War liaker today. He de
clared emphatically that there was
no thought of political expediency
in making put lie hia charges. On
the contrary h-j said his action was
taken with the intention of showing
how the anti-Oarranzistas Mexican
politicians in this country are en
deavoring to complicate Mexican
a fTairs.
At the (same time 5ec'y of Ftat

plicated In the alleged plot may
shortly be made. The persons are
said to be leaders in the legalista
movement In Mexico and followers
of Felix Diaz.

In discussing the situation Sec'y
Baker said:
"The obviously appropriate com
ment of the secretary of state on
the announcement precludes any
possibility of a misunderstanding.
The announcement by me will have
served its entire purpose if it does
what Mr. Lansing suggests, break
up the plans by publicity. Thos
people In ,Me:ico who have been
raiding the United States are op
posed to this government's Mexican
policy.
"The Mexican opponents of the
de facto government of Mexico
would be glad to complicate rela
tions between the United states and
Mexico and think this an appropri
ate time to do so. A large number
of men who have withdrawn from
Mexico are in this country constant
ly apitatinpr against the government
of Mexico.
Discourage Any Adventure.
"The statement made by the de
partment ought to discourage any
adventure on their part in the di
rection. It is unthinkable that po
litical enemies of Pres't Wilson's
administration in the United States
should be engaged in such activities.
The only possible suggestion of a
political purpose is to prevent people
in Mexico from creating a disturb
ance of a polit cal character in fur
therance of their own designs."
Sec'y Baker was aked whether
the purposes of the Pershing expe
dition have been changed.
"They have not," he said.

today in behalf of Pres't Wilson and
the Illinois democratic ticket. Mr.
Bryan was the principal speaker on
a special train which is bearing Gov.
Dunne and other state canil'dates on
a two days' swing through the south
ern part of the state.
"There are two supreme issues in
this campaign." said Mr. Bryan,
speaking to a large crowd in the
court house square. "One is domes
tic, the other deals with our for
eign relations. The tirst is whether
this government shall continue to
be administered by those now in
control or whether it shall be turned
back to the reactionaries from whom
the government was taken four
years ago.
"The second question is whethei
we shall repudiate a president who
has succeeded in keeping us out of
war.
"Vou cannot defeat Wood row
Wilson without throwing the govern
ment back into the hands of the
reactionary members of the repub
lican party and without rebuking
the man w ho has succeeded in keep
ing this country at peace while war
rages throughout Europe."
Mr. Bryan lauded Gov. Dunne and
assailed Col. Frank . Iwden, his

of corporation influences.
