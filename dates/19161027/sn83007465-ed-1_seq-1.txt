MEXICAN PROBLEM
BECOMING WE
VILLA ACTIVE AGAIN
His New Ascendancy in Portions
of Country Gives Cause for
Apprehension.
Washington, Oct. 25.?Conditions
in northern Mexico, revolting on the
new ascendancy of Villa, are commanding
more attention than at any
time since the border raids which
resulted in the dispatch of the
American punitive expedition.
Administration officials made no
effort tonight to disguise their opin
iuu mm me American-Mexican commission
sitting at Atlantic City can
not be expected to arrive at a satisfactory
solution of border problems
until the Chihuahua situation has
been clarified. Any agreement for
the early withdrawal of Gen. Pershing's
forces apparently is considered
out of question.
Moreover, the impression stood
out clearly that while the present sitftfll'ation
exists there is little possibility
^fhat the forces of regulars or National
Guardsmen on the border will
be reduced.
Coupled with ugly reports which
disparage the stability of Gen. Carranza's
regime and interpret his removal
from Mexico City to Queretaro
as a sign of the breaking up
process which his enemies have repeatedly
predicted, the military
movements of Villa, now making -a
formidable campaign in Chihuahua,
are regarded here as menacing the
de facto government's control of the
whole northern country.
t-rominent in me wnole situation
are apparently well founded but indefinite
reports of the connection of
the socalled legalists movements
with the whole train of evtnts. The
Mexican embassy today declared that
- Villa's forces consist only of a few
hundred men "claiming Villa as their
leader" and branded reports of instability
of Gen. Carranza's government
as "a flood of misrepresentations
that might be expected from
enemies," when the Mexican-American
began its work.
At the same time reports came to
the war department that Villa's
camp fires were in sight of Chihuahua
City and that Gen. Trevino, the
Carranza commander there, although
plentifully supplied with
arms and receiving reinforcements,
was short of ammunition and considering
evacuation the capital. Department
officials said toniglC t!:ey
had not heard the report reaching
the border that Chihuahua actually
had fallen.
As a matter of military stategy it
was pointed out that Villa, once oc_
^ cupying Chihuahua, could compel
( the surrender of Juarez and at an
other stroke might take Torreon,
Monerey and Saltillo, when he would
be a military factor somewhat different
from the bandit for whose
elimination an American military expedition
has dispatched. The war
department reports on Villa's latest
coup come from Brig. Gen. Bell, who
transmitted stories he had obtained
from refugees arriving in El Paso.
It was conceded that no room was
left for doubt that the bandit leader
was operating openly and in force.
Gen. Hell's dispatch gave details of
the annihilation of the Carranza
column under Gen. Ozuna by Villa
forces at Palemas and described
how the Villa troops captured or
kill.ed more than a thousand Carranza
troops and took all the supply
trains.
The Mexican embassy's explanation
of Gen. Carranza's move to
Queretaro was that he had gone to
prepare for the meeting of the constituent
assembly, fof which deputies
Just have been elected. The arrival
of the families of Gen. Carranza
and Obregon in the United
States was declared to be without
significance. Reports by Gen. Funaton.
however, said Gen. Trevlno had
privately advised many officials In
Chihuahua to leave the city. Trevlno
has sent his own family out of
the country and he prepared a special
train for officials.
Reports to persons here in toucn
with the legaista movement state unequivocally
that Villa has personally
given assurances that he will leave
Mexico and go to Cuba if Carranza is
overthrown. The shortage of am

WAGE U-BOAT WAR
UPON NORWEGIANS:
! German Submarine Strike at Their
I
Shipping.
London. Oct. 26.?German subma>rines
are waging a persistent war on
Norwegian shipping. In the meantime,
according to the Exchange |
Telegraph company's Copenhagen j
I cui responueni, mr ."Norwfpinn rov-i
'ernment ?ti 11 is discussing the form
of its reply to Germany's protest!
against Norway's stand with regard
11o submarines in Norwegian waters
and sensational rumors nre current
i concerning the relations between:
I Norway and Germany.
The Norwegian government organ,1
ireferring to these rumors, according
!to the correspondent, savs it may be
;assumed that the German protest is
so couched as not to bear the char-;
jacter of an ultimatum.
The Norwegian Mercantile Ship1
ping Gazette says that five German
I submarines have established a regular
blockade of the Norwegian south
! coast.
Iteuter's Stavanger correspondent
|says the Norwegian bark Athenian,
which has arrived at Hgersund, re|
ports that on Sunday she saw four
INorweiginn steamers set on fire by a
German submarine. The Athenian
jescaped to Kgersund and does not
dare put to sea again, says the correspondent.
munition among Carranza troops In
the North is explained by the same
J persons with the statement that the
| internal politics among Carranza
leaders is such that Gen. Obregon is
i><nnuii<iu.T Rt-cpiiik i-uiiirui 01 practically
all the available ammunition.
Recent news dispatches reported the
movement of a train load of ammunition
to Queretaro when Gen. Carranza
and Gen. Obregon went there
from Mexico City. Sources in touch
with the legalists movement say Ob-j
regon took it with him that he might'
.control its disposal.
So far as is known. Villa has no
leaders of consequence with him except
Inez Salazar. whom he liberated
from the Chihuahua penitentiary on
;his recent raid. Former Villa leaders
now exiled along the American)
border are said to be ready to rejolh
him at the first sign of a decisive
military success.
Some of the reports of the alleged
disaffection within the Carrnnza administration
have gone so far as to,
express fears for the safety of th?first
chief himself and intimate that
his removal was under circumstances
controlled by Gen. Obregon. Carranza
representatives. however,
brand that as absurd.
1 In military circles here It is believed
that the presence of Oen.i
Pershing's force in Mexico has s'erv-1
ed to keep this outbreak at arm's;
length from the border.

"Reform Democrats" Hear Address
by Their Chief in

Columbia, Oct. 25.?Members of
the Blease faction will not go Into!
the general election. This course!
of action was determined last night
in the convention of Bleaseites held
in Richland county court house in
response to a call Issued by W. A.
James of Bishopville late in September.
The resolution reaffirming
allegiance to the Democratic party, I
both State and national, was intro

erty Hill. It road:
"Resolved, By the Reform Democrats
of South Carolina, in convention
assembled, that we do hereby|
reaffirm our allegiance to the Demo-!
cratic principles, State and national."
Prior to the introduction of this
resolution a speech was delivered by
Cole l>. Rlease in which he disclaimed
any intention of going into
the general election. "I am not a
candidate for any office now. I do
not expect to be a candidate for any
office in the general election; and
will not be. I am not now a catfdidate
for any office in the near or distant
future."
Again Charges Fraud.
In an earlier paragraph of his
speech. Mr. Rlease asserted that the
nomination of Gov. Manning had,
been procured through fraud and,
that the oath in the recent primary
was no more binding upon the elec-i
tor to support the Democratic nominee
than it was upon other electors
who supported Haskell against the
nominee. R. R. Tilltnan. in the earlyj
'90s. The Haskellites were not
bound, he said, to support the nominee
if they thought the nominee's
("election had been obtained by
fraud just as I am not bound, unless I
I see tit to be. nor is any other man
bound to support the nominee of the
Democratic party, as declared by the
State Democratic executive committee

resolution wasfintroduced by Chits.
Carroll Sitnms of Rarnwell. commending
the action of the six committeemen
who refused to join in de-,
[daring Mr. Manning the nominee,
but added:
"We would be the last to encourage
any division of the white voters
of this State, which might tend to
lead to an appeal to an alien race.

I A third resolution was offered by

COTTON SOAKS RICHEST

SINCE THE CIVII, WAR v
t
New York. Oct. 25.?Cotton in the
future market sold today above 20 t
cents a pound, the May option rising
22 points to 20.01, the highest
price it has touched since the civil
war.
The advance carried prices $7.00 c
a bale above the low level of last '
Wednesday. '
The strength in the late tradiipjt
yesterday seemed to attract man> j
overnight buying orders and the de- (
mand was further stimulated by the
census report on ginning to October s

that the outrun would amount to a
less than 7.500,000 bales, but the!
official figures placing the total at
7.291,000 bales seemed to increase!
