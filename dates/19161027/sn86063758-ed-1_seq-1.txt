Rehabilitate Reform Faction?
Resolution are Passed.
News & courier.
Columbia, Oct. 24.?Tlie Biease taction
in caucus here tonight formally
adopted a resolution which shows that
there will he no organized bolt from
\ the Democratic State ticket. They
^ took steps to atempt the rehabilitation
of the minority faction by the
appointment of a central committee
to call another convention. The caucus
was held in the court house, the
Blease partisans cheering their leader
^continuously.
The following resolution, introduced
i)y John G. Richards, was unanimously
adopted: 1
"Resolved, by the Reformed Demo
i -cracs ui ouuui ^iuunua, iu wuicunvu
assembled, that we do hereby reaffirm
our allegiance to the Democratic party ^
-and to the Democratic principles,
State and national."
v Grievances Becited.
In the course of a long resolution,
which recited the grievances of th? socalled
"reformed faction," introduced
by C. . Sims, in this connection,
"'Still we would be the last to encourage
any division of the white voters
of this State which might tend to lead
to an appeal to an alien race."
f This resolution was unanimously
, -adopted.
The minority faction adopted a reso
lution introduced by (Wl A. Stuckey,
ijrroviding for a central committee of
from Aar.h Congressional district
and two from the State at large to
organize and attempt to rehabilitate
the Blease faction. The resolution,
unanimously adopted, reads:
"Resolved, That the chairman of this
meeting be and is hereby directed,
-to appoint a committee to be composed
of two members from the State
large, and' one from each Con?
gressional district, to be known as
*he central committee of the Reform
faction of the Democratic party of
South Carolina, which committee is
liereby empowered to call a convention
to meet at such time and place
as they may deem best, and to fix
the representation by courses, for
said convention." . ' .
Prepared List '
Upon the> adoption of the resolution
a prepared list was read out by the
chairman as follows: |
State at large, W. A. James, of Lee,
O. L. Johnson, of Spartanburg. By

reiteration of Blease's campaign
speeches the plaform having been

Orangeburg.

BLEASE'S FIRST SPEECH
AS HEPORTED FOR
CHARLESTO\ AMERICAN i
>Tr. Blease.
He said:
Oentlemen of the 'Convention:
Last October, in a convention sim- j
ilar to this, it was insisted that I,
should become a candidate for gov-,1
-a /-,*, nf this State. I did not desire!
11U1 V*. V*< _ - - _
to run, because T realize:!, among oth- j
v er things, that no gcvc,~nor of the State I
had ever served a thirA term, and I!
"begged you all to put nprward some j
one else. i
Another convention of the same
\
>1
character \va6 lield the following
spring, and again it was insisted thte
I should make the race for governor.
nn,i it was the unanimous vote of that
assemblage that I should do so. I consented,
and I took upon my shoulders
the responsibility of the campaign.
The matter is too fresh in your rtiinds
for me to tell you how that campaign
was conducted, but I leave it entirely
to you to say whether or not I made
an honorable fight?such a fight as
met, and does now meet with your approval.
That fight won for you, beyond
the shadow of a doubt, the victory
which you sought, and gave me a
majority of the votes cast by the Democratic
voters of this state.
I now hold in my hand, and will
read you portions thereof, evidence as
to that primary, which defrauded us of
the victory, conclusive in the mind of
any fair man, that votes were stolen
from the boxes, that votes were wrongfully
counted, that votes were purchased
with money and with whiskey,
that voters w^ere intimidated and coerced
by being threatened with dismissal
from their positions and with
foreclosure of mortgages on their
Dremises. and with the threat of refusal
to extend their notes in cases of
indebtedness, if they cast their ballots
with you and for me. ?
There is a law in this state against
libel and slander. If I have-said aught
that can not -be proved, let the issue
be made and I stand ready to meet it.
The editor of the Columbia State, in
the issue of that paper of October 16,
1916, asks: "What about the man who
would tempt another to break his
oath? Would whisper that which
rould cause the unthinking and the
ignorant to regard his oath lightly?
;*'buld suggest to the unwary that they
may compromise with their consciences?
Would insinuate that an
oath does not bind a man's honor?
who would Jend himself to the manufacture
of oerturieB in South Caro
lina?" * ~
If "he means by this question, those
who would encourage a bolt against
the declared nominees of the Democratic
party, I will answer his question
with a great deal of pleasure,
and here is the answer: EM ward DuRant
Smith, Richard Irvine Manning,
Alexander Chavis Haskell, Joseph W.
Barnwell, William E. Gonzales, W.
W. Ball, the editors of the newspapers
who supported Haskell against Tillman,
and all of the so-called Democratic
voters of this state who did not
cast their ballots for the regular nominee
n? thp 'npmnnrfttir' nart.v for erov
ernor for 1912, unless they believe:!
tbat the then nominee for governor
received his nomination by fraud, in
which event they were not bound to
support him, and did right in not voting
for him just as I am notbound unless
I see fit'to be, nor is any other man
bound, to support the nominee of the
Democratic party as declared by the
state Democratic executive committee
in the primary held on September 12,
1916, because he is not the nominee,
but his nomination was obtained by
the theft of votes, by the purchase of
votes with whiskev and money, bv in
timidation and coercion, fraud, theft
and perjury. And I charge here and
now that no more corrupt political
machine, not even the Tweed ring of
New York in 1876, has ever existed
than the present Democratic machine
in South Carolina today. John Gary
Evans and his crowd may never be
convicted and sent to the penitentiary
as were Tweed and his ring, but the
nomination of Manning will go down
in the future history of this state as
much of a stench in the nostrils of
the decent people of the American nation
as was the election of Rutherford
B. Hays.
I charge Richard I. Manning with
being particeps criminis, in that he is
an accessory after the fact, in having
obtained this nomination by
fraud, intimidation, coercion and corruption,
and if he had been that honorable
man that most of the press of
this state and his friends hold him out
to be, he would have declined to have
accepted the nomination, because no
ti.Vi/1 ia toinorJ with frouH Sin.-?
iliCVIl ? I1V Iv? UUiilVU U ivu li UUU L4AAV*
tion that is tainted with fraud and
corruption such as this nomination is
tainted with.
In conclusion I wish to say. as for
my part, that .1 am not a candidate
for any office now. I do not expect to
be a candidate for any office in the
general election, and will not be. f am
not now a candidate for any office in
the near or the distant future. But I
do propose to continue this fight for
the principles which I represent, and
for the friends that I love and the
friends that love me. '.And if ever you
ipnrn fhat role T, F.lease has ceased
to fight for them and their principles,
truly you can say that:
"This poor. lisping, stammering tongue
Lies silent in the grave."

]n n;y last letter or article or whatever
\ou may feel inclined to call it
i said chat in my opinion what was
the matter with Newberry is that all
of us?that is those who are active
n oi? less anil social life- are too
veil satisfied with, their noble selves,
and so long as the people are selfsatisfied
there will be no chance for
the town to spread out and grow. And
this reminds me of one of Buster
Brown's resolutions. You know, somehow
or other, I just like to read the
funny papers now. I am jus: like a
ohila in that respect, and to tell the
truth 1 am not sorry that I can feel
tb.it I am a child. It is v.rif, you
know, in that great Book something
about except ye become as a little
child, and so on. But as I was saying,
I like the funny papers?that is
some of them, like Buster and Mutt
and Jeff and Bringing up Father. I
can always see something in these to
nnint a moral or to adorn a tale. But
' I
as I "was saying I was reminded of i
one- of Buster's resolutions. Some-1
how he has taken up terribly oi late
with' Smith. Smith, you know is his
neighbor. I don't know that this particular
.resolution has anything' to do
with Smith, 'but I guess it has. Some
of the otter children have taken the
paper and I have anly tlie resolution
and it was some time ago Any *ay
here is the resolution.
0O0
"Resolved, That apropos of nothing,
let. me observe that the men who
catch .big fish use big bait and go
where big fish are. Those catc!i
little fish use little bait and simply sit
and wait. Men who are after bi * business
use big advertising space. They
know you can raise more corn on two
acres than you can on one. More
people see a big advertisement. If
there is, a picture in it mor<a people
see it- This is a picture age. Merchants
who hire a store and buy a
stock and sit and wait will have their
shelves half full of out of date goods
next year worth only half their value.
If you advertise you ksep things
going and get full prices for new
goods."
??0O0
Now what I am afraid of we are
ju->t silting and .vjtin.-- * ar-*
using little bait and going after little
fish. This is truly an age of publicity.
And of pictures, as Busier says. We
have got to get up and go after big
fish if we want to catch them, and
we must use big bait Bui as lont
as we are .'alisfieu w'th ourselves and
our conditions we going to by
sitting and waiting, like Viica'ftber, for
something to turn up. If we want
anything to turn up in t':is age we
have got to get out and turn it up.
That's what. Ho >ou catcli mj' If
you don't it i.-- tim? you were getting
up and out of tiiat waiting humor and
moo? which y.v.i are now in. j would
r;.fher see a mi" make a mistake now
and then doing something, than to
.-ee the fel!ox?: who aevsr makes a
mistake, bccause '.ie never does any
thing. Now, honest, woman : you ; j
0O0
By th$ wd\, this rc-riuijidj me or another
thing. Did you read President
Wilson's SDfePr-h at Shadow Lawn the
other day, which he made to the farmers?
If you didn't, and have the opportunity,
be sure to take time to
read it. It will be worth your time.
All of Mr. Wilson's speeches are worth.
}our wnne 10 reau. i^ui i ?as suu>.r
with one thing in this one particularly.
These two paragraphs appear in
that speech:
"Now I want to illustrate in another
way that has nothing to do with
farming, whatVe have been trying to
accomplish and I want you to keep in
mind, as the central word of the whole
idea of government that I am trying
to expound, the word 'co-operation.'
"And I want you to contrast that word
with the word 'combination.'
"Co-peration means all of us getting
together; combination means some
of us getting together and doing as
we please."
Now, I want you to get tbe distinc
cion or the difference between these j
iwo words. Had you ever seen them '
defined before? 'And isn't the definition
just as plain as can be? That
manuVilson is a pretty big fellow. He
no doubt has some faults just like all
of us who are human have, but he ai
ways says something worth while when
he opens his mouth, he seems to me
to say the right thing and to say it
in the right way. Now I didn't like
his foreign policy very muchii but he
seems to have known more about that
than 1 did even, but somehow he al- J
ways seemed to me to be leaning with
the allies too much, but 1 reckon he
knew better what he was doing than
I did, and } nave come to conclude
that he will be the means of bringing
about peace yet. But what we want
here in Newberry, South Carolina, as
soon as we can is to get rid of that satfnalino
tr> toa'ptllGr.
lOil^U 4.VVAA14C), ..3 VW 0W J-O
co-operation?not combination?cooperation?that's
the thing we need
right here in Newberry?"all of us
getting together." And then pulling
together. Mr. Wilson didn't try to tell
those farmers how to farm, but he told
them about the laws which congress
had passed looking to the betterment
of the farmer and how- the times had
changed and "how there were still
changes going on and how the govern- j
ment was sending the experts into ev-i
ery community to help to make bet-;
ter farmers out ot them. No doubt |
there will be some one to say that
what I write doesn't amount to anything?that
it is only like unto a little
flee barking at * big dreadnaught.
- V..A W rntra

heard that the cat could look at the
moon. And I am going to keep on
barking and looking at the moon, es#
pecially on these beautiful October
nights when the moon shines down in
this part of the universe as it doe3
nowhere else.
0O0
And this reminds me of a resolution
of Tige that I read in one of Buster
Brown's funny papers. It runs like!
this:
"Resolved, That the disagreeable
people should all be put together in
one place and every opportunity should
be given tnem to De jusi as mcau auu
disagreeable to each other as they can
?maybe they might quit it. No. They
don't know they are disagreeable.
They think it is the other person.
Besides they want to be mean and
ornery?it makes them happy. There's
only orfe thing to do with the sad
soul or the grouch: Run. Don't listen.
It isn't good for you. It isn't
right for you to let others pour their
troubles in your ear. It makes you
unnappy t? "ear it ?uu i*. umv
them magnify their trouMe and give
it importance. Tell them you have
an enlargement of the "oh, be joyful
club" as the chairman oi the committee
on forgetfulness. There's so
much unpleasant stuff loose that
we should laugh at it and kid it.
Don't let's be serious. It's a bore.
Tige."
Now that's fine philosophy. Let's
forget the unpleasant things we hear. |
And yet do you know there are lots J
of people right ^ere *n this good and 1
satisfied town who had rather heai
and repeat unpleasant things about
people and forget the good than to j
have a good square meal of jay bird j
eggs. Let's forget the unpleasant
things. And all of us join the "03:, |
be jovful club."

But on the other hand the man
who believes life is a gamble, with
"luck" the controlling genius and
guarding angel, makes the mistake
that has crossed the Roadway of Life
to be Littered with Whitened Bone#

or marring of one's life there
is no such thing as "luck;" and chances
play no part whatever in the winning

THE ROOF OF THE WORLD
"When the tasks of the day are ended
and the lamps of the House ar?
lit,
And the chambers are filled with
laughter where the lords of the
dwelling sit,
When the care of the living day like
dusty flags are furled,
I climb the mounting stairway that
leads to the Roof of the World.
Apart from the world's confusion and
din I sit aloof,
Content to dream in silence in the
peace of the world's wide roof:
But the murmurous hum of voices
comes up from the rooms below
And fills my ears with music and my
heart with a kindling glow.
The stars are near above me and
friedly their faces seem: t
Like neighbors they sit with, me as r
sit on the roof and dream;
They stoop like giant kinsmen and
take me by the hand
And lead me unresisting along their
goodly land.
When the honr of dreams is ended I
turn from the roof again
To join my human comrades in the
rooms of the^ House of Men:
