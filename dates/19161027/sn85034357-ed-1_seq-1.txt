POOLE-MEEK MARRIAGE
IN BURKE S GARDEN
(Burke's Garden Correspondence.)
Sometime among the ancients an
imaginative brain painted Father Time
as an old man with grim features
and muscular mein swinging a scythe.
The suggestion is that of a mower,
mowing and mowing and mowing, as
he stalks about over the fields. That's
Father Time in the somber role of the
Reaper Death. A very versatile dra?
matist is Father Time. All the world's
his stage und all the ages the scenes
of his comedies, farces and tragedies.
But if Father Time s an actor he is
also a magician. His scythe is n mng
ical wand. He waves it over youth
and hearts throb and live. Be waves
it over armies and hearts grow still
and cold. He waves it and it becomes
the brush of an artist, painting and
painting the picture. Life, for the gal?
leries of Eternity. He waves it and it
turns to the baton of a wonderful
Conductor, leading a vast orchestra,
the hosts of earth playing the sym?
phony of spheres. It isn't a cheap
metaphor to think of this same wiz
zard, Time, with his magical wand
ever and ever projecting before our
wondering eyes marvelous photo plays
until we feel that as the days flit by
we are gazing spell-brund at the un?
rolling of an endless film and we sigh
at the passing of scenes that will re?
appear, never. Some of the scenes
are somber; some are gay. Such is
Life. Unrolled out of Ecternity its
pictures roll back into another Eter?
nity. The figure is too real to be fig?
urative. The acts of our lives are
moving pictures. Some such thoughts
must have been in the expectant finds
of the waiting witnesses to the beau?
tiful mnrriage play in real life enact?
ed in Burke's Garden on October 18,
in late afternoon. So prettily wns
everything planned; so smoothly wns
everything executed that the guests
could easily imagine the very actors
only pictures on a screen. You wont
call it sacreligious, will you, to think
of the church as a play-house. Psy?
chologically, it is, you know, anyhow,
a play-house where the scenes of the
great Spirit-Drama, are being contin?
ually presented. The church, then, is
for the time being, at least, a play?
house, and this is the moving picture
we saw.
The lights are dimmed. The tile is
announced. A Rainbow Wedding. Of
course in a "rainbow wedding" the
dominant note must be color and so it
was. Autumn leaves and fall flowers
furnished the pastel tints for the back
ground. Two elaborate curtains hung
from wall to wall, one glowing with
miriads of soft-hucd maple loaves,
the other artistic traceries of ever?
green ferns- on a white ground. Three
white arches gracefully trailed with j
green vines and aglow with burning
tapers gave direction and position to
the procession. Six musical numbeers
began the program. Mr. Kirchensleg
er, of Williamson, W. Va., friend of
the groom, in a rich and cultured bar?
itone, sang feelingly, "At Dawning,
Oh, Promise Me," and "Perfect Day;"
Mrs. A. S. Higginbothnm, in the
sweet notes of a lyric soprnno, inter?
preted beautifully the tender senti?
ments of -"Today, All For You, and
Because I Love You. The skilled ac?
companist, Miss Katrina Gose, softly
and drenmily drifted into the peerless
love march in the picture marriage
scene of Lohengrin and Elsa. Then
the film began to unroll. Rev. Mr.
Bunts, of Williamson, a friend of the
groom, and officiating minister, and
Rev. Mr. Anderson, resident pastor of
the Lutheran church, with measured
and dignified steps came down the
' aisle, met and took positions under
the bride's arch.
In stately harmony marched in re?
luctant time the handsome grooms?
men in conventional attire. Mr. Kirk
ensleger, Mr. Thomas, Mr. James,
Mr. Harry Stuart, Mr. Walter Stunrt,
Mr. Nick Fuqua. Then all too quickly
passed across the screen the bewitch?
ing rainbow procession of girls. It had
been the irirlish pride and dream of
the bride that?if she ever did get
married, the conventional prelude to
a girl's dreams?she would have the
home girls for her bridesmaids. And
so it came true Miss Dora's dream.
First, gracefully marched and coun?
termarched Miss Poole, with Miss
Mary Moss in pink gowns and carry
lry G. Stuart
ing pink erysanthemums; then Miss
Mundo Moss and Miss Ida in yel?
low, with yellow erysanthemums, Miss
Bertie Thompson and Miss Ethel Meek
in lavender, Miss Bess Peery and Miss
Lottie Moss in blue., followed by Miss
Pansy Meek, maid of honor, wearing
green with nink crysanthemum and
Mrs. Trubic Meek, matron of honor,
in while with vellow erysanthemums.
Then the baby footsteps'of little Billy
Pooie, neohew of the groom, and ring
bearer, pattered in soldierly fashion
before four darling little flower girls,
Mildred Meek, Janie H?ge, Maria
Bowen and Mary Moss, daintily dress?
ed in gauzy costumes. Slopping coy?
ly to the accents of the march they
scattered flowers down the aisle in
front of the bride and her father and
in the opposite aisle in front of the
groom arm in arm with his brother
and best man, Mr. Orville Poole. The
film stops rolling. The vows are tak?
en. The ring is placed. The hands
are clasped. The blessing is bestow?
ed, and the twain are made one. The
picture lingers. The proud and hap
.' groom and the sweet and popular
bride standing effectionately side by
itdo, the center of interest, the love
theme, the cluster of pretty girls, the
group of handsome men, the little
flower maidens, the gail" colored
flowers and autumn leaves, all in a
tasteful arrangement and pleasing
harmony make a beautiful picture to
hang in Memory's Hall. Then the
film flits rapidly on to the quick, joy?
ous time of the recessional march.
The actors are off the stage, the lights
are turned on and the guests are left
to recall the details of the charming
photo-plnv.
What did the bride wear? White
Georgette crepe de chine trimmed with
silver cloth. And her boquet? White
roses and lilies-of-thc-valley. And
her jewelry? A four-piece- set, the
gift of the groom, u brooch, a La
Valliere, a bracelet, a ring, all exe?
cuted in beautiful designs of amethyst
and pearls. Among the guests from
a distance, besides those of the wed?
ding party already mentioned were
Mr. and Mrs. W. P. Poole, Mr. and
|Mrs. Charles Kcesee, of Blufield; Mrs.
Bob Poole, of Huntington; Mrs. Wal?
ter Dickenson, of Castlewood; Mrs.
A. S. Hif<rinbotham, Mrs. Walter
Steele, Mrs. Crockett Bowen, Mrs. J.
A. Greever, Mr. and Mrs. Billic Gilles
pie, all of Tazewell; Rev. and Mrs.
.Bunts, of Wiliamson; Mr. John Henry
Stunrt, of Lebanon; Mr. Frank Grose
close, of Tom's Creek.
If space permitted thi account
could be prolonged indefinitely with
stories of the pre-nuptial festivities
and the reception of the bridal party
at the bride's home on the evening of
the 18th. One incident of this good?
bye hour was the catching of the
bride's boquet tossed for fortune-tell?
ing from the top of the stairwny by
jthe bride into the upflung hands of
her brides-maids below. Miss Katrina
iGose caught the lue' " omen. Of this,
j more later. As to the bridal pres
icnts, a cursory glanco at them reveal?
ed to the guest that Mr. and Mrs.
I Poole must have a long list of inttr
'csted and admiring friends. The pleas?
ing array spoke gratifyingly of un?
mistakable "ouulnrity. In silver there
were knives and forks and ladles
and big spoons and little spoons,
'pointed spoons and blunt spoons, cof
' fee spoons, orange spoons and soup
I spoons, nnd all the spoons that or?
nament nnd perplex. In cut glass
there were trays and bowls and vasas
I of artistic design nnd spnrkling beau
jty. In embroidery, mats and doilies
and spreads and delicate traceries and
lnccries punched and pulled and darn?
ed and stitched in bewildering pro?
fusion. Then there were things prnc
ical in aluminum roasters and toast?
ers and broilers and stewers and all
things that make the plastic and plac?
id art of cookery a thing of beauty
and a joy forever. But most myster?
ious of all was the fnther's sealed
check. Mr. and Mrs. Poole were he?
roically motored through a bad black
night to Bluefield, where they liter?
ally caught the east bound train for
an undivulgcd destination. They will
return in a fortnight and set up their
Lares and Penates in a pretty little
bungalow at Williamson.

INTERESTING NEWS LETTER OF
NORTON HAPPENINGS.
Norton, Vn., Oct. 24.?We are hav?
ing a stiff and stubborn fight in Wise
county this time. Slump und his forc?
es realize that they ure up against it
in this county and are making every
effort possible to hold their own. Im?
ported speakers from Nangatuck and
Choiffowee, from Yubndam to Kaln
ni?ZOO have invaded the county telling
our folks what a great thing the
protective tariff was, which Henry
Stuart calod a last year's bird's nest.
Truth is, it is so easy to corner a re?
publican now by simply asking a few
questions that you cant help being
a little sorry that there is so little for
"them to stand on." Mr. Hughes was
pressed so hard as to what he would
nave done in the Mexican trouble that
In; finally and unfortunately said he
would have recognized Hucrta. Jack
Montague said in his thrilling and hair
raising eloquence before that great
assemblage at Cleveland last week
that the assassin who struck the belov?
ed McKinley down was just as worthy
of recognition as the assassin Hucrta,
who struck Madero down. Mr. Hughes
is no doubt a great jurist, but as a
statesman and politician he is about
? littlest American since the days
of Tom Thumb.
Mr. Gilmer's Letter.
Glad to see that fine letter in the
,No\vs from Mr. Gilmer of the Leba?
non Bank, stating how an individual
could get money under the new cur?
rency law. I heard two Republicans
last week telling a batch of fellows
nt the depot that nobody in this sec?
tion were benefitted by the Wilson
currency law; no one could get or had
gotten any money from these banks.
They were good men?one was our
friend, R. M. McCorkle, of Big Stone
(Jap. Now he must be told better.
He has been awn- over in the moun?
tains of Dlckenson the past year an 1
so wel satisfied with his lumber busi?
ness over there that he has just swal
.'owed everything a passinq- republi?
can told him. lie is too truthful, hon?
est and conscientious a man to be mis?
led in such n way. Nobody in Wise
county has been compelled to call on
c ue of these "Uncle Sam" banks. Our
local banks are only too anxious to
take in all the cood naper that is of?
fered.
The Wise County Fair.
We had the best fair of the South?
west. Such a display of fine fruit
has not been excelled in the State, the
horticulturalist sent from Blncksburg
to judge the fruit at the Fair said all
that high table land around Wiso
Court House would ere Ion" become
a solid orchard. From oCeburn you
go straight up until you reach the top |
of Guests Mountain, about tike it is
going un Rich mountain from Tnze
well, but when the top of Guests
Mountian is reached it makes off to
the north nlmost level and for miles
there is a great plateau of country
with high altitudes. This is the finest
fruit section of Wise county. The fin?
est opportunity extant for men with
small capital, or young men, is right
here in Wise county. Just get hold
of 50 or 75 ncres of this fruit land.
No matter if its all in woods, clean
it up and plant, it in apple trees: It
will make one independent in a few
years. An industrious man can afford
to borrow money from Uncle Sum's
bank and invest it in this fruit land.
Under the Farmers' Loan Act he can
borrow it at 5 per cent and take 40
years if he wants that much time to
pay it back. Will some Republican !
brother pitch and carrv the tune to
"Amnzin' grace."
Pete Litz, one of Tazewell's boys,
is the pioneer of fruit develonmcnt
in Wise county. Several years ngo,
with but little capital, he purchased
land right on the top of Guests Moun?
tain and began planting it. in fruit.
This year he will market six to eight
thousand bushels of fine winter nn
ples, and he is just getting a fair
start. A cold storage with a capnei
for about 8,000 barrels of annles,
is being put in by the owners of the
Norton Ice plant. T. F. S.
P. S.?Wonder if Hughes would
have done different from Adam in the
Garden, or from Moses in leading
the Israelites through the Wilder?
ness and Red Sea? Roosevelt says
when the Lusitanin wns sunk, that he
would have seized every German ship
he could have laid hands on. Vice
Presidcnt Mnrshall said, "Yes, and
you would not hnve found a San Juan
Hill nnd it would have taken more
than one nigger regiment to rescue
you."

Tomorrow, according to appoint?
ment, is Wilson Day in Tazowell.
Every Democrat ami every citizen
not a Democrat, with their familes, is
urged to bo present, and hear two
great speeches.
FOR WILSON AND TUINKLE.
(Rristol Herald-Courier.).)
It is said that there are numbers of
farmers and workiagmen in the Ninth
Vrginia district, who heretofore have
voted the Republican ticket, who will
vote for Wilson this year, but who in?
tend to vote nlso for Slemp.
Surely, citizens of independent
thought who vote for Wilson for pres?
ident will not at the same time vote
against him in electing a congress
The president can only work through
the congress in securing laws which
benefit the masses of the people and it
is idle for any man in the ninth dis?
trict to vote for Wilson for presi?
dent and at the same time vote for a
candidate for Congress who is against
him.
President Wilson has led in the light
for the Federal reserve bill, the farm?
ers' loan bill, the Federal aid road
bill, nnd ma'" other measures which
directly benefit the masses of the
people. If he is entitled to the votes
of citizens of the ninth district be?
cause of his good work, he is also en?
titled to the support of the same peo?
ple when thev vote for a congress?
man.
President Wilson has kept the na?
tion out of war. The country has
peace and prosperity. Mr. Slemp is
against President Wilson's peace pol
cies, and says they are all wrong.
If the people want war they should
vote for Hui'hes and Slemp. If they
want contnued neace and prosnerity
they should vote for Wilson and Trin
kle.
THE POSTMASTER A GRANDPA.
News has reached the desk of the
Editor of the Register department of
his paper, that a line girl baby was
born recently in the home of Mr. and
Mrs. Moorer, in South Carolinu.
The mother is the daughter of Mr.
and Mrs. A. B. Buchanan, of this
town. Girl babies in Democratic fami?
lies are no longer discounted, as they
will have a vote some day the same as
the boys.
Congratulations are extended to
Grandpa Buchanan.
PROHIBITION PRAISE SERVICE.
On next Wednesday night, Novem-1
ber 1st, the several prayer meetings,
of our town) will be merged into a

ian church. A recount of the strug?
gle and final success of the great
cause \vill*bc given. The pastors of
the churches will make brief, but in?
spiring, and heartening addresses and

ians. The people "heard a voice, but
snw no man," but listened nil the
snmc, and contributed $30 to the re?
lief fund. About $25 was added by

FINE PICTURES AT THE NEW
THEATER.
Messrs. Witten & St. Clair hnve
put on the screen at the New Theater
for the past several weeks a series
of as fine pictures as arc to be seen
in any city. In fact, these same pic?
tures have drawn crowded houses in
the larger cities. The costly pictures
featurning some of the leading actors
and actresses are seldom seen outside
the large towns nnd cities, and this
service is being continued now, nnd
will be continued if the people will
give their support. The town has been
clamoring for a nice show house for
years. Now, that there is such a
house, erected at large cost, it. must
be supported if it is to remain open.
A fine program is scheduled for this
end next week.

less votes for Wilson for one very ne?
cessary vote for Slemp. They are
scared all right, but "it's none of our
funeral."
There seems to bo little doubt that
the drift towards Wilson was checked
in its mad career last Monday at
Taste well.
On the basis of lunches served tho
crowd was estimated at from one to
five thousand, hut you should muku a
liberul allowance for repeaters.
One of the faithful who had been
shortening his belt for a week, said
that he had been looking for a square
meal, but the waiter chucked him out
a hand-out.
G. O. P. promises met their usual
fulfilment Monday. The six "export?
ers marked for slaughter" drifted so
badly thnt only three quarters, (not
of six but one beef), got to tho sov?
ereigns.
The fact that Wilson has adopted
and put among the statutes, all that is
admirable in the progressive platform
is doubtless the cause of the conver?
sion of Murdock, tho greatest of the
Progressives.
Unless he had thought Ohio was
tost to Hughes whv should Senator
Harding be stumping nt so much per
with the small frv in the Ninth dis?
trict?
It is not at all improbable that the
.suffrage and labor votes of Illinois
will turn thnt State to Wilson and
make the tier of three States solid
for the candidate of Pence and Pros?
perity.
Can you hear of a single man of
prominence in the whole country who
has turned from Wilson to Hughes,
or n single Democrat who has chang?
ed to Slemp?
Every day we have further proof
that Hughes is the candidate of the
millionaires and the interests, while
Wilson is the candidate of tho peo?
ple.
