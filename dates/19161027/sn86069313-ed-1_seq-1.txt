not be expected to arrive at a satis

There was much Joy in the local Republican camp Saturday when a
telephone call was received from Stntq, headquarters at Louisville saying
Ed Morrow would speak In Hartford Thursday afternoon, November 2.
Mr. Morrow is immensely popular t mong Ohio county Republicans and
that fact coupled with his ability as an orator assures a good crowd any
tlmo ho may come here for an addicss.
Big preparations are being made to make the rally on November 2
one of the greatest political demonstrations ever held in Ohio county.
Numorous requests have come from out in the county urging tho Coun
ty Campaign Committee to get Morrow here for an address during the
Presidential campaign. Tho comrnl tee has upon several occasions taken
the matter up with the Speakers Bi reau at Louisville but there has been
such an urgent demand for Kentucky's gifted orator that a date couldnot
be promised until Saturday. It Is expected that voters from all parts
of tho county will bo here Thursday and .If the weather Is at all prom- '
iBing Mr. Morrow will be compelled to speak In the open.
After the address hero, which begins at 1:30 In the afternoon, the
speaker will go to McHenry, where he will address the voters of that
place at 0:30 p.' 111. A large crowd is also expected to attend at the
mining city.
