"VOLUME XV.
SELMER. McNAIRY COUNTY. TENN., FRIDAY, OCTOBER 27, 1916.
NUMBER 17
- Both sides now admit that the
presidential race will be a close
one. There are no land slides.
The straw votes taken show
i Hughes has the lead by a small
majority. Several close states
.are being raked as with a fine
comb, as theirt results will de
termine the race. '.The great
number of . states comeded to
each side will not get much
wind jamming. ! Missouri, Illinois,
".Indiana, Ohio and Wisconsin
seem to be the Armagedon. ,
f ; Gov. T. C. Ryt at Selmer '
' The Governor filled his appointment
here last Saturday. He came on the
11:30 train and returned on the 4:30.
He ' spoke in the courthouse at 1
o'clock; occupying something over an
hour. The court room was filled,
some even standing. It was a repre
sentative crowd, with a good sprinkle
of ladies and a number of republicans.
. " Candidate Stockard, for the Senate,
was introduced by Judge J. C. Hous
ton, and made a few minutes' talk be
fore the Governor was presented ' by
Judge Houston in a complimentary
speech of five minutes.
, The Governor was in good trim and
made' a .very mild but impressive
speech, He has a pleasing address
and classical appearance. His speech
was a part only of hit first profound
speech -which was published in full,
and doubtless read by ' most of the
voters of the state. But his delivered
speech filled in with some good anic
dotes, is not near so dry as when
read. . ; y .
The Governor is a good genial fel
low, and has done as well as any other
tinder the conflicting elements in the
state. He says he will be re-elected,
and we presume he knows what he is
talking about. ,
The. crowd was a listening one,
with a few outbursts of applause.
He received congratulations by the
many who shook his hand after the
close. ' . -
State Policy From
' " ; Republican Standpoint
Nashville, Tenn., Oct. 23. Special
Two more weeks of rigid campaign
ing and the Republican party of
Tennessee will have completed the
most strenous campaign in the history
of the state. The result of this work
remains to be seen, but from every
indication the ballots cast on Novem
ber 7, will justify the effort put forth,
and every candidate on the state
ticket will come under the wire a win
ner. W w".
- Overall Grows Stronger
., Col. John W. Overall is being heard
from every day by the opposition, and
his campaign la telling ia Democratic
ranks as well as among Independents
and as he will carry the state solidly
among Republicans, his election seems
assured. He is making a strong race
among all classes, but especially does
he appeal to the business man regard
less of party. At Smith villa Monday,
his old county seat, he was given a
regular home-coming, Democrats par
ticipating alike with Republicans in
making up the large crowds that
swarmed into the little city all day
until the speaking ' Btarted at 1
o'clock. Col. Overall's terse business
like manner of expressing himself,
known to everyone who knows John
Overall ia telling day by day, and re
ports are coming in now,, that many
Regular Democrats are lining up with
. him, in every section of the state.
At Sraithville ha was applauded vocif
erously in the course of his speech,
and every indication is that he will
carry the county by a big majority.
Terry Abernathy A Winner -Abemathy
is even considered a
winner at Democratic headquarters,
where the Btate committee have long
since counted on losing their candi
date for the etate Railroad Commis
sion, Col. Enloe. Abernathy U a
good speaker, and has a splendid
.voice, but he finds it unnecessary to
make many speeches, employing the
handshaking method preferably. Reg
ular Democrats openly denounce the
democratic nominee and pledge their
Bapport to Mr. Abernathy in every
town that he visits. At Franklin,
Columbia, Murfreesboro, and Law-
rencebarg, where he visited the latter
part of last week, be was given a

royal reception.
Hooper ' Lines Up Independents
Governor Hooper is making it
warm for McKellar in Middle Tonnes
see. He is speaking in no. unmistak
able terms of his , opponent right in
the strongholds of Democracy, and
getting twice the crowds that Mc
Kellar is getting, and the Independ
ent supporters of old days are lining
up with him daily, everywhere he
goes. , So' strong is the sentiment in
favor of Hooper that the ' Tennessean
and American, owned by Senator
Luke Lea, raps the former governor
hard in an editorial published Sunday,
obeying the call of the party to check
Hooper if possible, as he gains daily
in this section. The Tennessean says
that he is a rank Republican (which
he has always admitted) and that he
was a partisan governor, and that
Independents should not support him
on this ground. That they should
stick to the nominee of the demo
cratic party. But Independent Dem
ocrats of Middle Tennessee need no
advice about Governor Hooper, they
know his record, and all he asks is
that they consider that, and then
vote. He is using his persuasive
powers to the best advantage, and
every speech is delivering the Inde
pendents to his candidacy. " adv
Cookeville, Tenn.,
October 9th, 1916. .
Hon. E. H. Dowdy,
Huntingdon,"Tenn. ;
Dear Mr. Dowdy:
If I lived in the Eighth Congres
sional District of Tennessee I would
vote to send L. M. Rhodes to Congress
as sure as I was able to get to the
polls November 7th.. and I have a
mightv good reason why I should do
so. Mr. Rhodes is a farmer and has
lived among farmers all his life. He
knows all about their trials and tribu-.
lationa, their ups and downs, joys
and sorrows, struggles, hopes, fears.
He sprang from sturdy pioneer stock.
He is bone of their bone and flesh of
their flesh. Instilled in every fibre of
his being is their grit and pluck and
loyal love for honor and native land.
He, himself, is a type of pioneer, for
he has fought many a ' long . year to
lead the farmers out of the wilder
ness of special privilege, monopoly
and greed into the land of industrial
equity and justice. v
. No man in America has told more
truth to mote farmers, in more places,
at more times, and with more power
than L. M. Rhodes. . . .
I know Mr. Rhodes personally, and
have had opportunity to study him at
close range. He is full of vigor and
vim that comes of living the clean
life. - Powerful in physical strength,
he has moral strength of like kind.
Few men could throw him in a physi
cal wrestle; there are none who could
break down his innate strength of
character. He is a type of well-balanced
manhood, with strength of
body and vigor of mind, both gov
erned by a heart that always beats
strong and true for humanity. Be
fore a crowd he is a power. ' I heard
him speak to literal aeres of people
and hold their wrapt attention for
nearly two hours. His brain is a ver
itable encyclopedia of facts and fig
ures. I have never seen a man with
such memory for statistics and such
ability to marshail them In a logical,
convincing manner.
I consider L. M. Rhodes the peer
of any man in public life today. He
would take rank upon the floor of the
House as an able friend of the great
common people of the Nation.
If the voters of the Eighth Dis
trict of Tennessee are awake to their
duty they will forget party ties, and
on November 7th., elect to Congress
Lucian M. Rhodes, a man. whom God
made bigger than a mere partisan,
and better than a politician.
Jours sincerely,
B. C. Huddleston, Democrat,
adv Putnam County.
