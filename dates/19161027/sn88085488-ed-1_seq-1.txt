TO FILL CITY TICKET
BY CAUCUS METHOD
Old Time Political Convention Bye
mm Will Be Revived to Name
' Municipal Candidates— M.
W..E. Church Night of Gen
( eral Election
• The basement of the Methodist
church will be the scene of an old
fashioned political convention at
7:30 on the evening of th© general
election, November 7, when a mass
meeting of citizens will chose candi- 1
dates for mayor and the councilmanic
positions, which failed to attract can
didates prior to the expiration of the
time for filing notices of candidacy.
Under the election laws such a meet
ing must be held on the day of the
primary city election and must be
called by a committee named for
that purpose by some body of citi
zens. To legalize the action the
chamber of commerce, at its Tuesday
meeting, resolved itself into a com
mittee of the whole, naming F. C.
Forrest as chairman and William M.
Porter secretary. These officers will
Issue the official call for the mass
convention and every citizen is urged
to attend and take part in the delib- j
erations.
The action of the chamber was l
prompted wholly and entirely I
through desire to clear the unusual ;
and serious situation which resulted !
from the dearth of avowed candi- j
dates prior to the expiration of the ;
filing period, and not through any
Inclination to name candidates of Its |
own choosing. Every citizen of Pull
man is privileged to take part in the
convention and every effort will be
made to name the. best candidates
available for the numerous positions
, open.
Candidates for mayor and council- j
man-at-large, each to serve a two- ;
year term, will be named by popular I
Tote of the entire convention, while
the various ward councilmen will be |
named by the representatives of j
their own wards in separate caucus I
and ratified by the convention.
The First ward representatives \
will name a candidate for the four- J
year term to succeed J. E. Ham-
Bond, whose term has expired, and i
another for two years to fill the un- !
expired term of J. N. Scott, who for- j
feited his office through removal
from the ward. U. G. Lawler was!
elected by the council recently to [
serve for Councilman Scott until the'
city election, when the people will!
lame a successor.
Ira Nye has two years yet to!
serve as Second ward councilman,!
hut another member from that ward, I
i for a four-year term, must be elect
ed to replace William Swain, whose j
term expires.
In the Third ward a four-year j
'■ member Is to be elected to succeed l
Councilman Burnett, while Council- j
"lan Duthle has two years vet to I
•erve. j
Mrs. M. F. Gannon, candidate for I
% clerk; J. s. Clark, candidate for'
treasurer, and M. S. Jamar, aspir
»»t for the attorneyship, each filed
[notices of candidacy within the pre-:
bribed period, but all the other of
fices went begging, making the con
tention necessary.
Unusual importance attaches to
he city election through the fact
that for the first time the mayor j
"U be elected for a two-year term
So the councilmen for four years
»»d two years. Under the new state
"* municipal elections, after this
rear. will be held only every two
fears.
, While talk of possible candidates j
or mayor to succeed Mayor Harley!
&ckson has not yet assumed exciting
"^Portions, several good men have :
°*« suggested for the important po- |
t!on- including William Swain, M.
J Henry, w. C. Kruegel and F. M.
fcgle. There Is reported to be a
el defined movement in some
garters to elect two women as coun- i
jj" men, although possible candidates
*"9 not been suggested.

Nearly 40 students of the State
i College, in the guise of amateur
: "hoboes," will partake of the hos
! pitality of the "Hoboes* Club" of the
I University of Montana during the
week-end as a result of the generous
invitation extended by the unusual
| Montana organization, which has as
! its charter members the 12 enthusi

! their way to Pullman to witness the
! drubbing administered to their team
by Coach Dietz's champions, lost all
' their shekels on the contest and were
obliged to again take the box-car
method of transportation on tho re
turn trip. Upon their return to the

the dozen "knights of tbe rails" or
ganized the "Hobo Club," and hav3
i guaranteed free board and free beds

MAN". STUDENT KAIL
j
The report cards sent out from the !
Pullman high school for the' first, six j
weeks' period of the current school
year showed a very large percentage
of failures In the various classes.« As
a result of the low grades the foot
ball team Is rather demoralized, but l
has taken a firm grip on Itself and
is getting into fighting trim ready to
fill the remainder of its schedule
with credit to Itself and the' school. ,
The following is the showing made
by the various classes: !
Miss Armstrong, home economics: '■
No. passed, 60; No. failed. IB; late
entries, 3.
Miss Davidson, foreign language
and mathematics: Passed, 70;
failed, 13; late. 13.
Miss Davis, English: Passed, 89;
failed, 36; late, 15.
Mr.. Graham, geometry: Passed, j
41; failed 12; late. 6.
Mr. Hevly, manual training: Pass- 1
ed, 40; failed, 5; late, 3. I
Mr. Kennedy, physics and Math.:
Passed, 64; failed, 23; late, 11.
Mr. Lacey. history and geometry:

failures.
In the number of failures given j
above' are Included all late entries, j
who have not as yet made' up the]
work missed. The lateness of this
year's harvest caused a very large
percentage of tho agricultural class
to come in late. The total enroll
ment for Pullman high school is BOW
higher, slightly, than ever before at j
this period of the' year, while the to- i
ii;i enrollment for the whole school
including the grades, shows a gain of ;
over i 0 per cent.
"free ride" method. Others follovel
last night, and a small army will
make application for the free 'eats
and sleeps" offered by tbe Montana
club.
Numerous other students left with
the team yesterday afternoon, ami it
is expected, unless some hard hearted
freight brakeman, whose football ar
dor has never been developed, puts a
crimp In the aspirations of the box
car brigade, that fully 75 loyal V.
S. C. football fans will be on the side
lines Saturday to cheer their team
in its efforts to beat the wonderful
Montana aggregation of moleskla ar
tists.
Two college fraternities conducted
"pools" to send a representative to
the big game, "Andy" Anderson of
Spokane winning the Sigma Nu pool j
and incidental free trip to Montana, |
and Carlton Trimble of Belllngham

i HARRY BECKETT DIES
! FROM HEART FAILURE
i Former Pullman .Man Pusses Away
Suddenly at Dayton Monday
Afternoon Was son of Mr.
and Mrs. <'. M. Beckett
of Johnson
Harry <■:. Beckett, son of Mr. and
I Mrs. ('. M. Beckett of near Johnson,
: and well known in Pullman, died
suddenly from heart failure .Monday
afternoon near Dayton, where he- has
■j
resided for several years. Concern
! ing the death of the well known
young man the Columbia County Dis
: patch, published at Dayton, had the
j following to say in its Tuesday cdi
i tion:
"While' driving a calf up the Mel
cum grade shortly after noon yester
day, Harry E. Beckett passed away
from heart failure, the remains being
; found by a mountaineer at about
]2:,'!0 o'clock, the' horse and dog both
j standing by. .
i ".less Hartley, who was notified of
Mr. Beckett's death, phoned word to
\ town and Coroner Andy Knight,
| Sheriff Will Wooten, Dr. Brunjes and
j Grant Burkhart Immediately went out
Ito take charge of the remains. i.a<
e'r Undertaker C. R. Rogg, who was
I summoned, brought the remains to
j the Hubbard <- Hogg undertaking
j parlors. Mr. Beckett had gone up
the- Patlt on horseback for a calf,
j which he was driving up the grade
lon foot, leading his horse. The ex
| tra exertion was evidently too much
'for his heart, which had been giving
him trouble for several years.
"Mr. Beckett was born In Colum
bia county, in fact, near where he
died, 35 years ago. He had lived in
Whitman county several years pre
i vious to his returning here eight
! years ago and was educated In the
j State College at Pullman. He re
, turned hero as agent for tto Kerr-.
j Gifford company and held that posl
tlon until they withdrew from this
I territory about two and a half years
ago, when he went on the farm of
ibis father-in-law, Add Cabin.
j "Mr. Beckett was a member of ♦ho;
; local K. of P. lodge, and Was MOM*
tary of the Dayton Commercial Cloh'
before going on the ranch. Ho was
a most congenial, companionable I
young man and a trustworthy, en-j
terprising citizen.
"Mr. Beckett Is survived by his;
wife, formerly Lulu Cahlll, a little
daughter, Charlotte, and his father
and mother in Whitman county, and j
three slaters, one at home In Whit
man county, another In Canada and
a third in Oregon. No funeral ar-
I rangements have been made as tho

OLE HANSON SPOKE
! TO LARGE AUDIENCE
, Aroused Much Enthusiasm by Ilia
Clear and Forceful Arguments
in Support of Wilson
i
>,
Ole Hanson, two years ago the pro
gressive nomine© for U. S. senator,
I Thursday evening of last week ad
dressed an audience which packed
j the city hall. In point of size and
I enthusiasm it was by far the most
successful rally of the campaign. Mr.
j Hanson is always a forceful and at
times an eloquent speaker, and from
start to finish he held the close at
tention of his audience and frequent
ly aroused hearty applause. He was
introduced by M. S. Jamar, and said,
in part:
"I did not come here tonight to
make a democratic nor a republican
speech. 1 came here to talk to tho
people of this city as an American
citizen, who loves his country and
believes in its Ideals and principles.
I believe that American citizenship is
a far nobler and grander label for
anyone to bear than the label of any
political party on earth.
"I have always said and still main
tain, that a man who will not leave
his party for the good of his coun
try, should he forced to leave the
country for the good of all parties.
"1 am not here to talk to you of
Wilson as the democratic president.
I do not allow the democrats of this
nation to claim Woodrow Wilson as
their own president. He is my presi
dent. He is the president of every
man and woman, of this broad land.
j I am not here to condemn either of
I the candidates! who are lie-fore th-5
! people for this position, but to con
j sider what has been done during the
past four c years. We meet to con
sider what President Wilson has
done to entitle him to our support.
"After Hie- great contest which was
waged in this country ,four years
ago, and when the smoke of battle
hail cleared away, we found that the
[republican party had been defeated;
' we found also that the progressives
'had been defeated and thai man—
i
the- man that I did not work for, the
i man that I was against, the man that
the progressives did not support, had
j been elected president of these Unit
ed States.
I -"We went back to our homes, not
discouraged but feeling that the peo
ple had made a mistake. I'am here
| to tell you that the people made no
mistake when they elected Woodrow
'Wilson president, but that the pro
gressives made the mistake in not
supporting Woodrow Wilson for
president.
'"Sow what did the progressives
promise the' people of this nation four
years ago? What was that platform!
And who was it that carried this
! platform out and enacted these de
i mands?" -
i The speaker then discussed the
numerous progressive measures
which have been enacted during the
administration of President Wilson
and argued that it was the duty of
all real progressives to support tho
man who had given them what they
wanted. He drew a vivid picture of
■
i the horrors of war and closed with
an eloquent appeal to his hearers to
I give their votes to the president who
had maintained "peace with honor."

1.1 MAN WOMEN STUNG
■ "
Several Pullman women ware in
cluded in the long list of victims of
ithe "10c petticoat" fraud, which,
once started, spread through the en
tire United States and included thou
sands upon thousands of economical
ly Inclined women in its list of vic
tims. Advertisements inserted In
'dally newspapers offered any woman
a "silk petticoat of 1917 design for
; 10c," the only string attached to the
offer being that each applicant ac
quaint a certain number of friends
I with the "big bargain." Ten-cent
! pieces flooded the malls of the ma
nipulators of the scheme, located ln
an eastern city, until Uncle Sam took
an Interest In the case and the "pro
moters" fled, leaving multitudes of
the letters from eager women, each
containing a 10c piece. The scheme
Is branded as a huge fraud, designed
to multch women of their hard
earned dimes, and with no Intention
of making good the offer.
