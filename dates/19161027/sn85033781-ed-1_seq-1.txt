MR. SLEEPER SAYS
THAT HE IS "OR."
Republican candidate
states his position in
etter to Mr. Spafford.
TOTAL ABSTAINER PERSONALLY
Not only that, but has always con
tributed heavily to the
"Dry" cause.
About the only election comment of
any movement in this section is the
wet and dry question and the attitude
of political candidates with reference
to that question. The silence of Mr.
Sleeper on the question, prompted Mr.
Spafford, a dry leader in this county
for many years, to write to the repub
lican candidate for his views. Grant
Hudson, superintendent of the Michi
gan Anti-Saloon League, told Mr.
Spftfford recently that Mr. Sleeper has
always been one of the largest con
tributors in his section and his nomin
ation and election is eminently satis
factory to them. The Sleeper letter
follows:
Bad Axe, October 18, 1916.
C. D. Spafford,
Charlotte, Michigan:
Dear Sir: Yours of the 14th, ;s
before me. You of course know just
how I stand upon the question, just
the same as I always have. And you
know what 1 have done in our own
county. But you must bear in mind
that I am a candidate of the republic
an party, and the party as I party
has taken no position on this question.
Neither has the democratic party a
a paily taken any stand. Each pari
has considered thi.- question as a
social, moral and economic question.
You know if I am elected governor, it
will be my duty to see that the laws
of the state are enforced and if the
prohibition amendment is adopted bv
the people then it would become my
duty to enforce this provision of the
constitution. If amendment carries,
I will do everything in my power to
make the state dry and if it does not
carry I will do everything to see that
our laws are enforced and make strict
er ones if necessary. That is the
position T took when I went into the
campaign and I see no reason for
changing it.
Yours very truly.
A. K. Sleeper.

KICK FROM ENGINE
CRUSHES HIS HAND.
Ernest Crawford of Lawton met
with a serious and painful accident
last Tuesday. He was employed in
the power plant, and was repairing a
gasoline engine. There was a "Kick"
left in the thing some where, and
when he loosened the bolts the cylin
der head blew out, shattering the left
hand. He was brought to Paw Paw
where the injured member was dress
ed by Dr. Maxwell, assisted by Dr.
Charles. All the hand was cut away
except the thumb and little finger,
which were left and can probably be
aved.
"BLUI BIRD" FEATURE.
Tonight (Friday) is "Blue Bird"
night at the Idle Hour Theatre. The
"Blue Bird" features are the very
best that money can buy. They are
clean, always tell a good story, and
the pictures are clear and distinct.
The feature this week is Louise Love
ly in "Tangled Hearts". Don't miss
it.
Rev. H. B. Gebhart of Covert called
-on Paw Paw friends last Saturday.
BALLOT JOB IS NOW
IN HANDS OF CLERK
Thi True Northerner job prSIICI
completed and delivered to the county
clerk this week the ballots for the com
lag olection. It was the largest job
of ballot printing ever done in Van
Buren county. There are four amend
ments and the regular ballot, making
five sets of ballots of 11,700 each, i
total of 58,500 ballots. Each set has
to be perforated, numbered and wrap
ped in two packages, to comply with
the absent voters law, for each pre
cinct. There were a total of 220
packages in this job. It required just
a half ton of paper for the work. The
entire force have been kept busy
night and day including Sunday, and
there has been very little time left to
spend on the newspaper. We ask
therefore the indulgence of our read
ers for any omission or lack of news
in this issue. We will make up for it
later.
THE GIRL ANO THE GAWK
"The Girl and the Gawk" played by
a stock company at the Longwell
opera house last Monday evening was
a real treat in every sense of the word
The play was a nice clean production
and was exceptionally well given.
Each player seemed to fill the bill ai
far as his or her character was con
cerned. The specialties were also new
and made a hit with the audience.
The quick hand drawing done by one
of the actors was as good as some of
those seen on our lecture and Chau
tauqua platforms.
SLASHED WAITER WITH RAZOR
Steve Hunter a colored waiter on
the City of Chicago boat from South
Haven to Chicago was convicted in
circuit court this week of assault on a
fellow waiter on the same boat. A
razor was the weapon, and consider
able cutting was done according to the
testimony. He has not yet been sen
tenced. o

PHASES
ERNER FOR STAND
Press of county doing its
share in the big liquor
fight.
Editor True Northerner:
I have been a constant reader of
The True Northerner for more than
fifty yean and have invariably found
it advocating such measures as were
designed for the upbuilding of the
community, both morally and finan
cially, and I congratulate the paper
for the splendid attitude it lias taken
with reference to the pending pro
hibition amendment, which if adopted.
will make the saloon an outlaw and j
make the map of Michigan all white.
I wish to emphasize the fact that it
is just as necessary to vote "No" on
the so-called "Home Rule" amend
ment, which is advocated by the
aloon element and expressly intended
to nullify our present local option law,
as it is to vote "Yes" on the prohibit
ory amendment. Let no voter be de
ceived by the spacious and misleading
slogans of " Personal liberty" and
"Home rule" with which the advocates
Of the open saloon seek to deceive the1
people. They tried the same game in j
Ohio and won out, and now there are1
saloons in some forty counties of that1
Btate that were formerly dry and
! wished to remain dry. Should the
fake "Home rule" amendment be man
ipulated in our constitution there will
without doubt be saloons in every
'county in Michigan. I also wish to
congratulate the county press in gen
I eral for the stand taken in this mat
ter. Every Van Buren county paper
j has declared squarely in favor of
i State wide prohibition and against the
proposed saloon amendment.
A Voter.
STORK STILL AHEAD.
There wore 8,54 1 deaths reported in
Michigan during the month of Sep
tember and 6,788 births during the
same period of time.
DON'T BE
The Prohibition question is a social, moral and economic
question.
It has no place in party politics.
The sponsors of the dry movement do not want it con
nected up with the personal candidacy of any individual.
Mr. Luren D. Dickinson refused to be a candidate for Gov
ernor on this ground.
Albert E. Sleeper, the Republican candidate for Governor,
and Republican candidates for state and county offices, all pledge
themselves to enforce the laws and make MICHIGAN DRY if the
Prohibition amendment carries.
If it is defeated Albert E. Sleeper will insist on a strict
enforcement of the present liquor laws or those which may be
passed by the legislature.
Vote for Albert E. Sleeper for Governor, Luren D. Dickin
son fcr Lieutenant Governor, Alex J. Groesbeck for Attorney
General, Coleman C. Vaughan for Secretary of State, Samuel
Odell for State Treasurer, O. B. Fuller for Auditor General, Grant
Fellows for Justice of the Supreme Court, and Charles . Town
send for United States Senator.

COTERIE PUTS ON
LECTURE COURSE.
Best course ever planned
here. Opening number
November 27th.
The ladies of the Coterie have
arranged this year for one of the
very best lecture courses ever put on
in Paw Paw. The talent is the very
best that money could buy, and a
great treat is in store. Were it not
for the ladies, Paw Paw probably
would not have a course, but they are
the ones who have taken the matter
in hand, and insured a rich course for
the winter.
While the ladies have taken the in
itiative, the real success of the ven
ture is up to the gentlemen. When
one of the ladies call on you with tick
ets, don't try to put her off with a
hard luck story, but dig down and buy
the tickets. Do it not only for the
Coterie, but for yourself and family;
for the uplifting of society and the
betterment of the community in
general. Every citizen in Paw Paw
and the surrounding country owes it
to himself to buy tickets for the com
ing lecture course, and thereby assist
in making this the best course ever
held here. We cannot give the feat
ures in this issue, but will do so later.
The first number comes on November
27th.
HELMER S. PETERSON.
Word comes the first of this week
of the death of Helmer S. Peterson
at his home in Galesburg, Illinois on
October 10th, of consumption. He
was a young man thirty-four years of
age and married only since last
March. He owned a farm two and i
half mile west of Paw Taw where he
spent a part of each summer with his
friends Mr. and Mrs. Lenn Huff, who
have charge of the place.

MISLED
FINE POINT IN THE
VAIL LIQUOR CASE
GsorgS Vail of Decatur was convict
td in circuit court Wednesday of t
violation of the liquor laws. This
i was not a real local option case, and
i was the first complaint of its kina
made in this county under the new
Judicature Act. Vail runs a pool
room in Decatur and lives upstairs in
the same building. At the rear of
the pool room are two rooms, one used
as a garage and one as a store room.
The liquor on which the charge wa
made was found in the garage, and
the point in the case was "Did this
room in which the liquor was found
constitute a part of his residence".
Bonds were given, pending a review
of the case by the Supreme court.
A decision will be awaited with inter
est, as it is a new point in this county
at least.
CELEBRATED TENTH BIRTHDAY
Monday afternoon Master Wendell
Reidl celebrated his tenth birthday by
! inviting about twenty of his little
j classmates to aid him in the festiv
ities. Many games were played and
little Miss Ruth Harrington captured
the prize. A big luncheon consisting
of everything in the cullinary art that
could possibly appeal to the appetites
of a growing future generation wad
! served at five o'clock by Mrs. Reidl.
j Wendell received many gifts from his
young friends to preserve as mem
entoes of the happy occasion.
RESULT OF THE' STRMM VOTE
The veteran O. W. Rowland has
taken a straw vote. He interviewed
the first hundred men who called at
the County clerk's office, and if any
reliance can be placed on a Straw bal
lot, everything looks like Hughes,
Sleeper and a "Dry" state. Several
of those interviewed were undecided,
but following is the result of the bal
lot: Hughes 65; Wilson 30; Sleeper
56; Sweet 21; Prohibition Yes 76;
No 18; Home Rule Yes 15; No 75.
