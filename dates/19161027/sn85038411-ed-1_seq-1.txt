Yllla or other bandits in Mexico, j
have arranged a spectacular attack J
to be made either upon some part
of the American forces or upon i
some American community on the !
border between now and the date

against the policy which the Ad

nificant in this connection that i
both the State and War Depart- '
ments were advised that the ban
dit forces operating at the present
time in Mexico are being paid in !

Full particulars have been trans
