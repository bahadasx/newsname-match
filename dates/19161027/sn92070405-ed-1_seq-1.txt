BRAKEMAN IS
KILLED HERE
The second fajlality in two weeks
occurred in the local yards Thursday
night when B. G. Chamberlain, a
brakeman from Tucson, was instant
ly killed. Tho deceased was well
known here and was very popular
among the railroad boys. He is sur
vived by a wife and one child.
A detailed account of the accident
follows:
The undersigned, constituting a
board of inquiry, convened at Lords
burg, New Mexico, October 20th,
1916, for the purpose of determining
cause of and responsibility for above
accident, finds:
A westward trnln arrived and was
placed on No 1 track and called to
leave at 7:35 P. M., as 1241. The
outgoing crew was called to switch
this train at 6:35 P. M. Brakeman
Chamberlain was instructed by Yard-
master to get their caboose froir
caboose track, set another one oul
for another train, .then to clear No
4 track by picking up a car of stod
on that track and placing it with
their caboose on rear of 1 211, thcr
return to caboose track with the in
coming caboose of this train and an
other caboose which had arrived or
No. 2 track prior to the arrival oí
1 241, stating that if they returned
before 7:00 P. M. to use main track
otherwise to return through track No
4, because 1 244 was due to arrivf
at 7:05 P. M. and would occupy mair
track. 1244 arrived at 7:10 P. M
and headed down main track where
engine was cut oft" and sent tohousr
through No. 4 track, and in maklnr
this move passed engine 2757 switch
ing 1 241 on east lead. After com
plying with ill switching instructions
Brakeman Cole and Chambcrlaij
rode the front end of leading caboosr
down main track, after 7:00 P. M
and contrary to instructions, and col
hded with the head end of 1 244
Contrary to tho opinions of iiumbe
of train crew, the conditioi. of th
wreck indicates excessive speei
which we estimate at 15 to 20 mil
an hour, as stated by Brakemiui'
Cole. -Brakeman Cole succeeded in
jumping off the head end of caboose
while Chamberlain did not and was
caught between head end of caboose
and first car in 1 244's train, killing
him instantly.
From the above, it is tho unanimous
opinion of this board that Brakeman
Chamberlain is primarily responsiblf
for this accident, because he diso
beyed the instructions of the Yard
master, when he used the main tracl
as a thoroughfare instead of No. 4
Further, we hold Brakeman Cole anc'
Brakeman Chamberlain rcsponsiblr
for moving through a track at ox
cessive speed when they did not knov
that the track was clear. As
cabooses were ahead of tho engine
the cupalo blinded the headlight nn
prevented engine crew from seein
obstruction in time to have avoide '
the collision.

passing review of the Democratic-
candidates for county offices nunctu-
atcd by long, loud bursts of applnusc
