Although Mr. B. Stoddard had
been ill with typhoid fever for
some time the citizens of Golden
Valley, Billings and Stark coun

to hear of the death of that prom

Air. Stoddard had the misfortune
of breaking a leg and at about the
time he was presumably recover,

with typhoid, from which he suf

At the time of his death the
deceased was fifty-eight years of
age. He was one of the pioneers
of old Billings and Golden Val

this vicinity twenty-five years
ago from Connecticut and en

The fact that Seaman Smith
has m'ade a good sheriff of Gold
en Valley county cannot be dis
puted by any fair-minded, unpre
judiced voter. It can be more
said, he has conducted the duties
of his office in a way that would
prove that he has not shown pre
ference for any or mialice toward
none. In other words, he has
"done business for the county on
interest that he has always taken

was of such volume that his death
means a great defal to. its welfare
His friends were legion through
out the entire stale, as was prov
en by the fact that a special train,
bearing Masons, Elks and their
friends was run from Dickinson
to Sentinel Butte iliis afternoon
in order that several hundred
from there might have the privi
lege of paying their last respects
to one whom they loved and re
spected.
The deceased leaves to mourn
his death a loving wife, three
children and an aged father to a'l
of whom is extended the sympa
thy of his hosts of friends.
Funeral services were held at
Sentinel Butte this afternoon and
interment was made in the ceme
tery there. Rev. John Orchard
of Dickinson officiated at the ob

N. P. TO BUILD.
Dickinson, N D. Oct. 26.—
There is a rumor current that the
directors of the Northern Pacific
railway ae contempll.iting branch
line work out of this city, because
of lie extensive fimprfovements
now under way in the local rail
way yards.
The roundhouse is being re
built. machine and car shops en
larged, in fact the entire yardage
and shop equipment in Dickinson
is being improved and moderniz
ed. Some Venture the guess that
the Northern Pacific will make a
proposition for the purchase of
the newly organized Dickinson
and Southern railwfay, as soon as
actual construction work com
mences.
Anyway, Dickinson is due for
a big boom both in the building
and business lines. There should
be a million dollars in new build

should he not be elected to an.
other term? Those who do not
want more than a square deal
will support him, as they realize
that according to law he can
serve but one term more and they
believe that considering his faith
ful service in the past he is en.
titled to what he seeks, another
term. Seaman takes orders from

Regarding U. S.
Senatorial Fight
In the opinion of the editor of
this paper Porter J. McCumbcr
should receive the support of
every Republican in Golden Val.
ley county, regardless of the gross
misrepresentations that are being
published concerning his record
in the Senate. It is an easy mat
ter to place anyone in a false light
by saying that they voted for this
bill or didn't vote for that bill and
then claiming that this bill is a
good one for the farmer or that
the other one is not a good bill
for the farmers. It is easy to de
ceive when one stops to consider
that ninety-nine people out of a
hundred are not familiar with
any of the big issues of the pres
ent day. Legislation thpt will
not prove a hoax cannot be
brought about in a day and the
man we prefer is a man that
makes a study of what's wanted
and then goes about it in a clear
and deliberate way to get what
is wanted, not something claimed
to be "just as good" and which
may afterward prove of no bene
fit at all. Mr. McCumber is not

Wednesday evening was heard by
a good sized audience of respect

Still, as secretary of the Republi

introduced the speaker with a
few well chosen remarks in
which he drew attention to the
fight made by Senator Gronna

the North Dakota farmer when
they opposed the Canadian reci

Mr. Norton complimented the
citizens of Beach on their city and
then took up the discussion of
national politics. He said that at
the time President Wilson took
his oath of office he considered
him a very strong man and was
of the opinion that he would
mlake a wonderful president.
Since then, or during the past
three years, he had been forced to
change his mind, the result of the
policies which Mr. Wilson car

I A Beach Booster
His efforts in retaining some protection to wheat and
other grains have resulted in saving millions of dollars an
nually to the farmers of North Dakota.
lie has stood at all times for better markets, better
roads, better postal facilities, honest grading and inspection
of grain, full protection for farm products, pure foods and
drugs, a rural credits law that would be simple and efficient
in its operations, and would bring interest to its lowest rale,
and liberal land laws.
Ilis committee positions and length of service will give
him an influence with the next administration, an influence
and standing which could not be obtained by his opponents
for years.
The election of Senator McCumber means that the Sen.
ate will just have a majority of Republicans, in harmony
with Republican policies and a Republican president. The
election of his opponent means a democratic majority in the
Senate, opposed to protection on farm products and oppos.
ed to any program of a Republican president.
He lias been true to his conscience and true to his State
and Nation, and on that faithful service he rests his cause.

his hands. He did. The robbers
took his *70.
One of ,the highwaymen then
ordered Swanson to take off his
coat. The victim stood up and
started to shed the coat when one
ot the men deliberately pushed
him backwards off the swaying
train. The train was running
about thirty miles an hour at the
time.
He srtuck on the side of the
grade and rolled over and over
into a ditch. His nose and face
were badly scrja'chcd and he suf

been offered to them.
