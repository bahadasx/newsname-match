LEADING GERMAN
SAYS WILSON HAS PROVEN
BEST FRIEND OF HIS PEOPLE
Has Kept Country Out of War While
Roosevelt Might Plunge It In
If Hughes Wins
That the citizens of German ex
traction or nativity in Lincoln coun
ty are not going to be misled in the
present presidential campaign into
voting for Hughes and thereby play
ing into the hand of Roosevelt, the
greatest enemy of Germany on the
American continent, was the state
ment of Bruno Miller, - a prominent
citizen of the Ottenheim section, who
was in Stanford Wednesday.
Mr. Miller is a native of Bavaria,
which has furnished among the very
bravest soldiers in the German army
in the present great war. He lived in
Wisconsin for a number of years be
fore coming to Lincoln county, and
has always taken a great interest in
politics and knows what is going on
in regard to every big public ques
tion. Mr. Miller said that he believed
that the eyes of the citizens of Ger
man blood are rapidly becoming op
ened to true conditions, and they are
beginning to realize more and more
that Woodrow Wilson has been a
good friend of the Germans, and es
pecially when it has become so very
evident that Roosevelt wants war
with Germany and that he is the
chief backer of Hughes the republi
can candidate for president.
It has been repeatedly charged,
and not denied, that if Hughes is
elected president Roosevelt will be
his Secretary of War, and Mr. Mil
ler says that the thinking Germans
do not want war, and realizing that
there would be great danger of war
if Hughes is elected, and Roosevelt
has his way, they are going to vote
for Wilson, after all.
Mr. Miller says that he personally
knows a number of good German
citizens of his community, who
usually vote the republican ticket,
who are either not going to vote at
all in the election this fall or else
are going to vote for Wilson, because
of the part and power that Roosevelt
is playing in the campaign for the
election of Hughes. News from the
West End of the county also, is to
the effect that the German citizens
of that section, are beginning to un
derstand just what the election of
Hughes might mean to the relations
of this country and Germany, on ac
count of Roosevelt, and that most of
them are beginning to see things in
the same light as Mr. Miller does,
and as he so forcefully expresses him
self. , ,

REV. WALKER CALLED AGAIN
A call for the 10th year of ser
vice as pastor was given Rev. D. M.
Walker, of the Stanford Christian
church Sunday morning, at a busi
ness meeting of the congregation
after regular services. It is the cus
tom of the Christian church to em
ploy their pastor year by year, and
the call extended Sunday is for an
other year. No specified time is fix
ed in which Rev. Walker must give
his answer to the congregation, as
to whether he will accept the call
for another year or not. He has done
a great work for his church since
coming to Stanford, each year seeing
an increase in the membership, and
his many friends hope that he will
decide to accept the call for another
year's service in this field.

The patrons of the Hustonville

Miss Kate Bogle, as teacher of the
primary department. She has been a
member of the faculty for quite a
number of years and has never failed
in her undertakings. In fact it is im
possible to say too much in her
praise, as she is regarded as being
one of the finest and most cultured
women in our town. In her place

hitched to a wagon became frighten
ed and ran down the side walk on
Main street at a very lively gait. No
occupants were within and fortunate
ly no damage was done. The animals
belonged to Lee Tumey and Charles
Dunn.
On Monday afternoon the whole of
Hustonville was put into panic by
the running away of two horses. As
Mrs. John Blain was turning around
in front of the hotel, her horse be
came frightened, turning the buggy
up side down and throwing her out.
The horse went on and ran into a
buggy in front of Riffe's store, oc
cupied by Mrs. Ada Carson, Peavy
house and she was doubled up under
neath her buggy, from which the
horse tore loose. Both horses went
kicking and running down the Stan
ford pike at break neck speed, but
were finally caught. The women were
shaken up considerably and are now
nursing bruises, scratches and a
sprained ankle, but congratulations
should be made that there was no
one killed, as it seems almost a mira
cle that such did not occur.
Friends were very much surpris
ed to hear of the marriage of Miss
Nannie Read, of Danville and Mr.
James Reid, of Hustonville, which
took place at the home of the bride
in Danville Monday afternoon. She

of the word and has a wide circle of
friends both in her home town and
here, where she often visited

Long Shot Went Over
Local Man's Horse Wins Ott Willis
Makes Good As Jockey
R. H. Anderson, a two-year-old
race horse owned jointly by Sena
tor R. L. Hubble, of Stanford and
Col. D. N. Prewitt, of Danville, won
the first race at Latonia Wednesday.
The colt was a long-shot, paying
$58 for $2 tickets on him. This
youngster is a half brother to the
crack two-year-old of the west, Westy
Hogan, and though he has been slow
in coming to form, his owners look
for great things from him.
In this connection, it is interesting
to his friends here, to know that Ott
Willis, son of W. R. Willis, of Stan
ford, is about to get his jockey's li
cense. The youngster has been doing
fine work in handling horses for the
big stable of J. O. Keepe and can
ride as low as 100 pounds. He has
shown that he has the nerve and
spirit and Mr. Keene thinks that he
will make good suret He will go with
the Keene stable to Tia Juana, just
below the California border, in Mex
ico where the winter racing season
will soon begin. Young Wm. Wester
field, of Paris, well known here, and
who is a great friend of young Willis,
has secured a place with a big Lex
ington racing stable also and will
soon get his jockey's license if he de
velops as rapidly as Willis did.

Saw Zeppelin Raid
Joseph G. Hackley, In London, De
scribes It In Letter Home
Mr. and Mrs. J. T. Hackley, west
of Stanford, have just received a let
ter from their son, Joseph G. Hack
ley who is continental representa
tives of the Westinghouse electric
interests in England, descriptive of
a Zeppelin raid on London, which he
witnessed recently. The letter will be
of interest to the many friends of
Mr. Hackley "back home." He writes:
51 Coram Street, London, Eng.
Monday, Oct. 2, 1916.
Last night the German Zeppelins
appeared over England again ten
in all. They threw out many bombs
but killed only one person. I sat up
late to see them and I had the most
wonderful view which I have yet had.
The one brought down was probably
near 750 feet long and one of the
latest and largest types, carrying a
crew of about twenty men. This is
the fourth one brought down in the
last four weeks.
It was located in a few minutes
and was soon plunged to the earth.
In falling it illuminated the sky with
a reddish light, and for a few sec
onds one could not have told the
night from day.
My room, which was dark at the
time shone inside like the sun was
shining in it. The Zeppelin fell at
a place, called Potter's Bar, a little

It made me think of the Day of Judg
ment as one generally pictures it
mentally. The light was so intense
that it instantly gave me the im
pression that it was about to fall on
the house in which I live. The great
flames looked to be so close at hand
that I decided to go down into the
street and be outside if it fell near.
It was a beautiful starlit night,
there being a slight mist which no
doubt reduced much the light emit-
ted by the blazing Zeppelin. The
people in the hotel in which I live
had all retired, but I resolved to stay
up and see the action. I was look
ing out of my window watching the
play of the searchlights; except for
subdued chatter of the people who
insist on congregating on the street,
there was the dead of night's still
ness. At midnight the sky became
blood color. Simultaneous with this
there went up a cheer from the peo- J
pie which re-echoed up and down the
streets for miles. To the North I
saw the crimson flames shooting out
from the ship. Within fifteen sec
onds the great glow in the sky had
disappeared and all was quiet again
except that the cheering had aroused
the people in the hotel where I live,
and they were all anxious to know
what had happened. It was all over
so quickly, and so far away that we
could not hear the guns or the shrap
nel bursting. It was a quiet, but
spectacular affair. The airship fell
in a tree, as you read in the papers,
and the crew of nineteen were all
dead when they hit the earth.
.1 remained up until two o'clock
hoping to see another display, but
the rest of the Zeppelins had fled. I
am quite well and all goes well here.

Crab Orchard.
The Teachers' Association met at
the Baptist church Saturday after
noon, October 21 and a most inter
esting and instructive program was
rendered. Prof Hatfield in a most
pleasant manner, as chairman intro
duced the speakers. The devotional
exercises were to have been conduct
ed by Rev. Morgan, but as he is in the
mountains conducting a meeting, Mr.
Cyrus Johnson was selected and a
most appropriate reading and prayer
were offered, then Mr. H. G. Skiles
came forward and gave them a hearty
welcome in behalf of Crab Orchard's
people. His remarks were beautiful
and every teacher present felt that
he was indeed welcome. This address,
was responded to by Mr. .Cytfus John
son in a very graceful manner.
The first subject, "Value of Agri
culture in the School," was to have
been discussed by Messrs. Earl Rus
sell and Eugene McWilliams, neither
of whom was present. Mr. Cyrus
Johnson showed plainly the relation
the community bears to the school,
its duties and obligations and how
very much a good successful school
depended upon the community at
large. His remarks were fine and en
joyed by all. Miss Adelia Russell, of
Stanford, showed the value of play in
the school. Her remarks bearing out
the idea that play developes the men
tal faculties of the child by making
the body healthy and strong and ar
gued that especially should the
smaller children have regular times
for play. After Miss Russell's re
marks. Miss Fannie Thompson fav
ored the audience with a special solo
and never was "The End of a Per
fect Day" more sweetly sung. Miss
Thompson has always responded so
cheerfully when called upon to sing
and is truly an inspiration to all
coming in contact with her, her pure
life, sunny disposition, gentle man
ner. Being totally blind has never
once made her gloomy or despondent.
"Home Economics" was finely
handled . by Misses Melsaida Chad
wick and Bettie Miller, who each
had given much study to the subject
and their ideas were pleasingly pre
sented. Messrs. Henry Davis and J.
B. Hutchins were enthusiastic over
the road condition in relation to
good schools, proving conclusively
that nothing could conduce more to
the welfare and building of a good
school than roads which could be
traveled by the children in summer
or winter without miring in mud and
water.
Miss Ellen Moore read a fine pa
per on the "Consolidation of Schools,"

thing worth while to say and they
were not disappointed. He has done
a most glorious work among the chil
dren of his district, and as he ex
plained his manner of teaching and
upbuilding we could not but feel that
he was in love with his work. That
his whole being permeated with the
one great desire to raise the school
child to the highest standard of no

working for his good and not solely
for the public school money. We are

FACES A LIFE TERM
PERCY STEWART CHARGED
WITH BURGLARY THIRD TIME
Bloodhound Follows Convincing
Trail After Robbery of Baugh-
man s
Mill Elevator
Percy Stewart, a well known local
negro, faces a life time sentence in
the penitentiary as a result of the
burglary of the grain elevator at the
J. H. Baughman & Company mill
some time Monday night. Stewart
has already served two terms in pris
on for burglary and if he is convict
ed on this charge, and the evidence
is very strong against him, the third
conviction will carry a life-term.
Harvey Moore, employed at the
mill noticed that the gate to the coal
yard had been torn down, and then
clumsily propped back up, when he
came to work early Tuesday morn
ing, and an examination by Messrs.
John S. Baughman and W. B. McKin
ney, of the mill showed that sacks of
coal had been dragged out of the
gate. Corn scattered along, also
showed that some of that cereal had
been taken out. A case knife near
the elevator door, gave mute testi
mony to .use in having been slipped
through a crack and used in lifting
the hook by which the door was fas
tened from within. Some corn was
also found to have been taken from
some sacks in a box car.
The mill management immediate
ly had Lair's best bloodhound brought
down from Hustonville. The dog
took a false trial at first and, after
going down the railroad, went out
the Danville pika and lost the scent.
Brought back to the cars and the
the mill elevator, it took scent again
and went direct to the home of Per
cy Stewart on Waterworks street. It
was brought back again, and this
time took scet to the home of Char
ley Baughman, colored, in Macks
ville. Before, this however, Baugh
man went to the mill and told that
he had bought some corn and a hog
tankage from Percy Stewart the
night befjpre. r
Stewart, who had.ibeen employed '

overheated while being" driven to
Danville, had been given to him and
Johnny Green, and after dressing it
.they sold it Monday for $11.
Stewart denied that he had robbed
the mill but said that he saw it done
and that Allen Hill, Charley Dawson,
"Big Foot" John Engleman and Hath
away Hill, other negroes, were impli
cated. Search warrants were taken
out and the home of each named
was searched but nothing was
found to incriminate any of the boys
upon whom Stewart sought to fix the
guilt. Stewart persistently denied
that hehad robbed the mill, and he
also denied that he had sold the corn
and hog feed to Charley Baughman.
Rev. Ed Hubbard went Stewart's
bond, to the amount of $25, until his

MRS. TRIBBLE'S 9th ACCIDENT
Mrs. J. S. Owsley, whose right an
kle was broken when she was thrown
from a buggy the other night on the
Danville pike, is resting as easily as
could be expected at the home of Dr.
E. J. Brown, where she has been
taken for treatment. Mrs. Owsley's
nerve under the most trying circum
stances was well manifested at the
time of the accident, when she lay
under the buggy, holding the horse
fto keep him from running away in
the darkness, while Mrs. Tribble
went to the residence of J. Frank
Smith for help. Mrs. Tribble was un
able to lift the buggy off Mrs.
Owsley and had to go to the home of
Mr. Smith. T. A. Rice then came
with his auto and carried the badly
hurt woman home. This was the
ninth accident of this kind in which
Mrs. Tribble had figured. She has
been in runaways and been turned
out of buggies, but luckily has never
yet been hurt in any of them.
