The state's attorney said sho would be
a witness for them in rebuttal.
The state objected when the defonso
sought to Introduce a deposition tuken
at Louisa, Lawrence county, Kentucky,
detailing Black's entrance Into and de
parture from the Masonic order. It
claimed the deposition was Intended to
Injure Black's character with tht Jury.

deposition waa admissible as showing
that Black was unreliable and that
statements made by him could not be
believed.
This, It contended, would Justify the
action of Copeland In going to him to
protest against his lectures.

his decision.
