THE PROGRESS OF THE WA$.
One of the marvels of the present war
is the development of stupendouseharity.
•'And now abideth these four, faith,
hope, love and charity, and the greatest
of these is charity." We have always
protested against the translation in the
"new version"where'Hove" is substituted
for the word "charity." Whatever may
have been the meaning in the original
Greek, the words are not synonimous in
English. For instance one may love his
friends but has charity for his enemies.
One does not love the beggar at bis door
but does have charity for him.
Three years ago on this side of the
water, we knew but Utile of. the peoples
7f Belgium, Poland, Serbia, Armenia
tifend many other places that have been
made known to us by the ravages of
war.
While millions of men have been kill
ing and maiming each other, strange to
say, other millions have been busied in
binding up the wounds, and feeding the
widows and orphans who have become
victims of the terrible strife.
An article in last week's Saturday
livening Post gives some detail* that are
aot only interesting in themselves but
show to what an enormous bounds the
charity of the world and particularly of
tbia eowntijr baa been extended to these
auCavera.
In an editorial like this wa can refer
to little of these detaila for want of «paoe,
but a few figures will be suScdent to
show the reader what world-wide charity
weans.
There is a -body-of men who.are the
Belgian Belief Association. They have
no constitution or by-laws. Then are
•more than tar thousand oontributing
sub: committees in all parts of the world,
all under tbe directions of'the oentval
committee iniLondon, of whom the head
is Mr. Ricfcard B. Hoover, a California
mining engineer, who was* called to tbe
work by Ambassador Page at the begin
ning of the war. He has many able -as
sistants who like himself "have been
called" and who work without pay and
some pay (their own secretaries. In ®b1
guim and Northern France behind the
German ilines are hundreds of others,
mostly Americans who have ootributed
unpaid services in terms of from-six
months-to two years.
What are
theB&men
doing? (Here are
a few random figures taken (from the
EveningiPost article. 'Look them over
and then r«ad between tbe lines as to
what thisvvast charity meaaft as a'tnere
business 'matter to -say nothing'of the
many other details and environments
There are7Z2 ocean going
steamers bear
ing tbe tflag of the iRelief (Commision
which-sail across the ocean (unquestion
ed by anybeligerent warship.
Because the supplies am distributed
by canals in Belgium the «eommission
has 962' canal barges and €2 'tugs.
It «D)ploys 300 dock iaberers at .Rot
terdaaa ai^d-2500 bargemen..
There are .2770 distributing points in
Belgium and 1882 in Northern (France.
Every mootb the imports «f foodstuffs
at Rotterdam-amount to 250 millions of
pounds, while of wheat almost three mil
lion bushels arrive—and not-as much as
a sack of .flour could reach iRotterdam
except through theRelief Committee
The wheat is ground in (Belgium
nominally .paid or volunteer labor of
Belgians, of whom 48 thousand are on
the rolls to the committee The monthly
output is ffi2c million loaves.
But by a unique plan the ^Belgians
themselves ,pay for it all.
At the beginning of the war only about
six per cent of tbe population were with
out means. Then the great, trouble was
that owing .to the blockade on the seas
and the war zones on land that supplies
could not be-brought into Belgium, at
all. The work of the Relief Committee
was therefore (then to furnish sijpplies
that could be purchased by those who
had the means .as well as feed .those in
poverty.
After two j«asa. of war, with no bus
iness going on, the class of absolute poor
has been increased to a half of the whole
.population numbering.altogether about
seven millions,.
To feed these three and a half millions
the Relief Committee has now only a
revenue of about five millions of money
monthl. A little .arithmetic will show
how pitifully often three and a half goes
into .five—for a month's if ood.
JBut as we said afi food is sold to tbe
iBelgians, those who ihave money pay in
money, while tbe others pay in "paper
money" furnished by .the Committee.'
In the lattet case every applicant is ex
amined as to financial ability to pay or!
not to pay.
To tbe actual cash «ost to tbe Com
mission of all articles «f food there is
added the "profit." Tbe profit is the
various contributions of the charitable
iii money, labor, rents, freights-etc.
The goods are thus sold at actual cost
plus the profit. So that aoy contributor
will see that his money goes twice as far
than it oould as a straight gift. Thus
the Belgians who can pay ate compelled
to pay for the poor who are not able to
pay for of oaurse the surplus is used to
feed the poor.
As the war continues, contributions
are getting less. Much money is needed
and contributed by beligerent nations
for the victims from their own armies
And countries while in neutral nations
tbe high cost of living and other econ
omies make charity a greater burden.
The needs are daily getting greater,
and the supplies getting shorter. The
Relief committee try to keep two weeks
ahead of the needs. Without'them in
two weeks Belgium would be starving,
for even the wealthier could find no food
to buy..
The nearest Belgian Relief Committee
is on Garry Street, Winnipeg. Address
Belgium Relief Committee.
THE WAR.
The war operations as to advances
are rather mixed in tbe different locali
ties. After several weeks of heavy fight
ing tbe Russians in Galioia seem to be
checked in their advance towards Lem-
berg. Tbe Roumanians with tbeir Rus
sian allien are getting tbe worst ot it and
retreating at the different points around
and about that country. Tbe Serbs
however appear to be gaining ground in
the reoovery of their own land Tbe
Salonika army thus far has not cut
much figure as a military factor though
it has (made somepragress. The Italians
report the UBUSI cannonading. Along
thejSomme, both French and British re
port advances of substantial nsture.
The surprise of the week however was
the sudden advance of the French at Ver
dun by which they claim havereooveced
•on a five mile front wipe two miles
depth ol the territory won by the Ger
mans at so (terrible a cost during the
spring and summer.
These varying successes of either side
in the west and east are keeping the war
critics busy trying to size up thesitua
tion. To us it just ejnphasues our
opinion that the war has reached its
climax in this that no one of the warring
countries san add to their armies unless
it may be Russin. They are at or past
tbeir extreme maximum
strength. Form
this out it will be all that any of them
can do to keep the ranks filled, and it
cannot be long before even that will be
impossible.
TARIFF ON CAfTLC.
If a farmer has the facts, he can draw
his own conclusions. He bas ^plenty of
time to think, and his thinker .generally
works accurately. He can plow afield
and think at tbe same time. .Bo when he
grapples with the tariff .question and
reads in the government repocts the fact
that in nine months under the .Republi
can tariff law we imported cattle to the
value of-45,680,733 on which the import'
ers paid into the treastuy a duty
$1,531,136, while in the same .length of
time under Democratic tariff laws we
imported cattle to the value of $16,510,
435 on which the importers .paid not one
cent of duty, the farmer is sure to reason
out thotsonclusion that tbe industries of
this country were drained to the extent
of more than $11,000,000 and the treasury
was deprived of a million and a half
dollars of revenue. The .Democratic
Department of Commerce is authority
for tbe statement of facts. We have the
admission, therefore, tbatjtbe Democrat
ic tariff law caused an increase of $11,
000,000 in.the purchases of foreign cattle
—Mexican,and Canadian, chiefly,—and
a corresponding decrease in the demand
for American cattle.
of
The American farmer can plainly see
that his market mtist have been injured
by this increased competition.
He can also pee that if the Treasury had
.received that million and a half revenue,
along with numerous olheramounts that
the Democratic tariff law cut off, we
sbould not now have a deficit of 87?,000,
000. And yet the Democratic campaign
managers hope to get part of the farmer
vote.
FOR WHOM WILL YOU VOTE?
To vote is the privilege of every citi
zen, but it is more than a privilege, it is
.a solemn duty. Each citizen is apart of
the government an official of the gov
•ernment, and voting is one of bis official
duties. .But voting is not the mere for
mality of casting a ballot it means cas
tting an intelligent ballot. Before the
ballot is marked in tbe booth tbe citizen
sbould inform himself .as to what prin
oipiles are in issue, what of these he be
lieves for the best and whom of tbe can
didates will best carry out these prihci
pies. The tuan who takes no time or
thought over these matters is what the
English call in these war times over
there, a "slacker." He is a man who re
fuses his duty to the government under
which he lives.
Just now we are close to a most im
portant election, presidental, state and
county. Sometimes in a presidental
election the issues are of an internal and
local nature mostly of just a business
nature, like the tariff for instunce and
the differences are but- a matter of
opinion, and if settled wrong can be
righted at a biicceeding election and no
great harm done.
In the present election the issues are
those of an external nature. They are
largely issues forced upon us by the
great world war in Europe. Whether
we will or not the United States must
take its part in the settlement of the
problems that peace is bound to bring.
Never before has the American voter
had so great and important issues be
fore him for settlement. And perhaps
all tbe more remarkable from the fact as
yet those issues are unknown. Only we
know that they will certainly come. All
we know is that the greater part of the
world is to be remade and remodelled
and as tbe greatest of tbe neutial nations
we must participate in this work.
Of course we have our local issues as
usual^ which will rightly influence the
PEMBINA, PEMBINA COUNTY, NORTH DAKOTA, FRIDAY, OCTOBER 27th, 1916. NUMBER 19
views of the voter, but every thinking
mat realises that peace in Europe meai
very much to us both externally and in
ternally, and that is therefore the para
mount issue of this eleotion. The solu
tion of these questions will have not
only a national effect but will affect
every individual of this country.
With these important matters facing
us in the near future we hear the re
mark, that this is to be a quiet election.
The only fear we have is the possibility
that the people have not realized bow
important that we choose the right men
to lead us the next four years. On tbe
other blind we are hoping that the quiet
nese is that of thinking men who will
oast their ballots on the 7th of Novem
ber, realizing what that ballot may mean
to thiB nation and to them and tbeir
families.
We must leave tbe final solution of
many of these war and other issues to
our leaders. Tbe leaders are the presi
dent, and congress, but not only them
but also the «tate governments and the
county governments. The latter supple
ment and bold up tbe hands of the
Washington authorities. The latter are
tbe local leaders, tbe minor officers, who
are just as necessary to the formation of
public sentiment as are the greater
officers.
There are no German sergeants in the
French .army snd no British corporals
in the Austrian ranks. The voter con
tradicts himself who mixes his ticket,
except under extraordinary circum
stances. For these candidate? represent
principles, and this a government of
principles.
STATE AND LOCAL CANDIDATES
It is ihardly necessary to discuss tbe
head of the state ticket. Mr. Frazier
was nominated by such a strong major
ity of the Republican party and the
Democratic nominee is so distasteful to
a large ypart of his own party that that
lesue lis already decided. Mr. Frazier
will doubtless be elected by the largest
majority ever received by a candidate
for governor in this state.
CONGRESSIONAL.
Hon. P. J. McCumber will be elected
b.y a large majority to 6erve his fourth
term in the senate. In the senate, as in
no other body of lawmakers, experience
counts. All the eastern states found
this out years ago, and as a result have
always returned tbeir congressmen term
after term and in consequence have prac
tically held the balance of power in con
grosser half a. century ^Mr. McCum
ber the peer of any senator on the
floor of the senate in debate or personal
influence. No man in North Dakota
however able, can till bis place during
tbe next six years term.
Mr. Helgeson of Milton is the Repuba
lican candidate for this congressional
disttict.. He is a hard worker and an
able man. He also has the benefit of
experience and will be elected by a large
majority.
THE STATE OFFICEBS.
Tbe results of the primaries returned
some of the old officials as candidates
and turned down others. But as far as
we know the old ones that are still on
the ticket were good men and the new
ones come highly recommended. The
