CONSTANZA NOW
IN CERMAN HANDS
London, Oct. 24.-The fort of Con
stanza has been captured by the Ger
mans, the German office announced.
Troops of the central powers have
crossed the railway line running be
tween the Black sea port of Constan
sa and the River Danube at a point
to the east of Murfattar.
The fortress of Constanza was tak
en by German and Bulgarian troops.
Constanza was one of the principal
objectives of Field Marshal von Mack.
ensen in his campaign in Dobrudja. It
Is of particular importance by reason
of the fact that it is the eastern ter
minus of the only railroad between
the Black sea and the Danube, which
it crosses at Tchernavoda. Thence
the railroad runs westward into Old
Roumania.
Constanza has been notably useful
in offering a seaport and railway en
trance for Russian troops and ammu
nition sent to the aid of Roumania.
Its capture cuts off the most con
venient water route for Roumanian re
plenishment, especially in munitions,
of which the Roumanians have been
reported badly in need.
French Gain in the West.
On the Western front along the
Somme the French have made another
successful push in the vicinity of the
Peronne-Bapau me road, capturing the
spur known as No. 128, northwest of
Sailly-Saillisel, according to the Paris
bulletin.
Petrograd reports the slackening of
the battle in the Narayuvka river re
gion in Galicia, where Berlin and Vi
enna announced that an important
Teutonic victory had been gained. The
repulse of a Teutonic attempt to cross
the Boldurka north of Brody, in the
district northwest of Lemberg, is
claimed.
Four tons of projectiles have been
dropped by a French air squadron of
twenty-four machines on blast fur
naces north of Metz and on the Mets
and Thionville stations, the French
war office announces in its report of
aviation activities. Hits were secured
on all the objectives, it is declared.
Another French flotilla bombarded
factories at Rombach.
Successful operations by British
camel corps on the Egyptian western
frontier have resulted in the clearing
of hostile forces from large areas and
the capture of some 175 prisoners,
saes the British official statement on
operations in Egypt. Armored cars
operated in connection with one of
camel detachments.
AVOIDED GERMAN U-BOAT

England.

Scotia Highland brigade and several
other Canadian units, together con
fisting of 276 officers and 5,729 men,

Gun Mounted.
New York, Oct. 24.-With 2,600
sacks of mail, but carrying no passen
gers, the Cunard line steamship La

Eighteen Miners Killed in Alabama
Disaster.

lost their lives as the result of an ex

and rescuers have brought sixteen
bodies to the surface. Six were ne
gross. W. F. Lowery and a miner
named Pervis still are in the mine
and all hope for their rescue has been
abandoned.
Game Warden Graft
The game warden graft should be
knocked out. The dozen of cheap
politicians that strut around the
country to no good should be given
their walking papers. These soft
fingered fellows and their friends say
this is no tax. The duece it isn't. If
any one wants to go out and hunt a
little it is $1.10. The sheriff and the
constable can do this work just as well
and not be a part of a big political
machine to control the revenues of the
state. There never has been a game
warden in this part of the country
that did any good. Every citizen
should be a game warden. Let our
sheriffs, constables and foresters and
every man who wishes to hunt be
nominated a game warden. The money
collected in each county to be spent
in that county. Let us try a new way
of protecting the wild game and let
the protection come from the homes
of the men who live near where the
game is found.----Camas Signal.
Some Drunk; Others Soused
The monotony of the jailers' exist
ence was broken further last night
with a string of drunken Indians from
the Flathead reservation. From early
in the evening until early in the morn
ing, they were unloaded from the
patrol. Some were merely drunk
others were "soused."----Butte Miner.

LAND COMMISSION
FIlING DAMAGES
In the district court at Missoula last
Thursday Judge Duncan appointed
appraising commissioners in the case
of the Northern Pacific railway
against a number of land owners
through whose property the branch
line of that company from Dixon north
through this valley will run. There
are some eight or nine defendants in
this case, five of whom were represen
ted by C. F. Rathbone, one by D. N.
Mason, and the others by attorneys
living in Missoula.
Judge Duncan named as the com
missioners J. Arthur McGeorge and
John N. Bailey of Ronan and Elmer
Hughes of Missoula. Their first meet
ing was held in Ronan Wednesday of
this week and since that time the
gentlemen have been busily engaged
in their efforts to determine the value
of the land and the amount of damages
due them for the right of way.
The amounts offered by the company
are generally considered ridiculously
low, especially where the right of way
cuts through forty acre tracts.
UNPATENTED LANDA
IS NT TXABLE
Judge GeorgeM. Bourquin last week
handed down a decision in the case
brought by government officials at the
request of a number of entrymen on
the Flathead reservation who have not
yet received their prtents.
Judge Bourquin decided that una
patented land is not taxable since it
still remains the property of the gov
ernment. The court restrained thte
collection of taxes on this land and the
sale of the land to pay last year's
taxes. The equity of the entryman is
alone taxable in the opinion of the
court and the title must not be dis
turbed.
The decision involves land lying
within the scope of the Flathead irri
gation project and approximately
2,000 entrymen are effected. Last fall
a great many of these entrymen paid
their taxes, while others refused to
do so or paid under protest.
Assessor Currie and County Treas
urer McCarthy are authority for the
statement that the decision of Judge
Bourquin will have no local effect,
other than to make null and void the
protests under which Flathead ranch
ers paid their taxes last year.
"We have never collected taxes on
more than the settler's equity,' sadi
these officials yesterday.

OFFICE HOLDERS
MUST CONTRIBUTE
Following is a copy of a letter writ
ten to the various county chairmen in
Texas by the chairman of the national
democratic committee, R. Bonna Ridg
way. it is self explanatory:
To County Chairmen:
At the instance of National Com
mitteeman Poindexter, who conferred
with the National Campaign Com
mittee while in New York a few days
ago, I am writing to suggest that you
have a private interview with the
postmasters in your county who were
appointed by the present adminis
tration, in regard to contributing to
the National Democratic Fund. The
names and salaries of the appointees
are given below.
The National Democratic Executive
Committee is expecting each post
master or other federal appointee, to
contribute to the National Campaign
Fund an amount equal to ten per cent
of one year's salary. Of course this
is not compulsory, but we are advised
that in the event President Wilson is
re-elected there will be a permanent
organization of our forces throughout
the country and a note will be
made of the loyalty of those appoin
tees who contributed as well as of the
disloyalty of those who refused to con
tribute, toward the re-election of the
administration from whom they re
ceived their appointments,
The civil service law will not permit
the writing of a letter to a postmaster
demanding money for campaign pur
poses, nor will it permit anyone to go
to the postoffice and request a sub
scription to the campaign. But you
can see the postmaster away from his
place of business and make such an
qppeal to him as you would make to
any other Democrat to contribute to
the National Democratic Campaign
,Fund, and can advise him as to What
the National Committee is expecting
of him.
It is hoped that you will proceed in
telligently along these lines and ar
range in a legal way to solicit each
Democratic postmaster, or other ap
pointee of the present administration,
to contribute to the Wilson Campaign
Fund, all of whom should realize that
the interests of President Wilson in
this race are identical with their own.
Very sincerely yours,
R. BONNA RIDGWAY,
Chairman, Central Committee.
