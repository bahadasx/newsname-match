hundred voters attended, nearly all
of whom declared themselves as be

Republican ticket. That precinct has
been claimed by the so-called Pro

REPUBLICANS OF
MORA COUNTY HAVE
A STRONG TICKET
COUNTY SO SURE OF GIVING
BIG MAJORITY THIS FALL
THAT THERE WERE MANY
CANDIDATES FOR THE OF
FICES Mora, N. M., Oct. 23. After stir
ring contests for nominations, which
prolonged the meeting, the Republi
can county convention for Mora
county concluded harmoniously and
satisfactorily with the selection of
a
ticket that satisfied all sides
Delegates and other Republicans,
representing every section of the
county and every element of the par
ty, feel that the ticket is the strong
est that could have been named
and will receive the solid Republi
can vote of the county. The dele
gates and their friends left the con
tention determined to work for the
ticket.
I The outcome of the Mora county
convention, solidifying the Republi
can party of the county and giving
the Republicans confidence, is of in
terest to the entire state.
Early in the campaign the Demo
crats did their best to foment dis
cord and dissension among the Mo
ra county Republicans, desiring to
arrange a "fusion" ticket there with
a wing of the Republicans. The at
temot failed miserably.
The convention just held, while
fraught with plenty of lively rival
ries for places on the ticket, re
sulted satisfactorily for all and ore
eludes any consolation in Mora
county for the Democrats. All Mora
county is now lined up for the Re
publican ticket county, state and na
tional.
Following is the county ticket
named:
Senator, Severo Salazar; represen
tative, Alejambro Arandro; Frank A.
Roy, assessor; J, JJ. Medina; coun

at its head.
The Roswell meeting held in the
armory on Thursday night brought
out an audience which packed both
the main floor and the galleries.
A" old resident declared it was me
largest political gathering that he
had seen in the city. It was all
more remarkable in its political
significance as this meeting was held
just the night after the former
Governor Lee Cruce, of Oklahoma,
had delivered an address at one of
the motion picture houses.
Bursum made an admirable speech

moves which he said have caused
this nation to be held in contempt
by practically all the world powers.
Many expressed tne Delief that it
was ont of the greatest addresses
that Senator Fall has ever made
in New Mexico.
It is hard to imagine a reception
more royal than that accorded to
the party by Lincoln county. That
for a great number of years has
been the home of Governor Mc
Donald. From the first meeting held on
Friday morning until the close at
Carrizozo on Saturday night, there
were large audience and unbounded
enthusiasm. Meetings were held on
Friday night both at Hondo and
Lincoln and at neither place would
the buildings anywhere near hold
the people who sought to attend.
The meetine at Carrizozo on Sat
urday night was held in a motion
picture tlieatre which was just be
ing completed. The auditorium is
thirty feet in width and one hun
dred feet long. All of the space bet-
ween the edge of stage and back
wall was literally packed with men,
woman and children. Even the aisles
were filled as well as the space be
hind the back seats.
More than one woman with a
baby in lier arms stood and listen
ed through all of Bursum s speech.
Judge W. E. Lindsey, candidate for
lieutenant governor, followed Bur
sum on the program.
These two were the only state
candidates in the party. J. H. Wag
ner candidate for superintendent of
publis instruction, having sustained
a broken rib in the automobile
smashup near Carlsbad and gone to
h,is home in Santa Fe.
Otero county was disappointed
over the inability of Bursum to fill
his engagements there. Meetings
had been arranged at Cloudcroft, La
Luz, Tularosa, and Alamogordo, but
he was compelled to forego the
pleasure of talking to these people
in order to keep his engagement
with Col. Roosevelt, and it was part
ly on account of Bursum's repeated
requests that the colonel consented
to make the trip into New Mexico.
Notwithstanding that Bursum was
missing, the crowd that attended
the big assembly hall was the big
gest political gathering that I have
seen in Alamogordo in nine years.
Bursum returned from Albuquer
que in time to fill all of his Dona
Ana' county engagements begining
Thursday morning. Nine meetings
were held closing at Las Cruces
last night, and all of them were
well attended and characterized by
enthusiasm. Every teat was filled
in the armory at Las Cruces, and
more than two hundred were unable
to find places to sit. No audience
that Bursum has had in the state
was more responsive and. demon
strative, or apparently more- tho
roughly in svmnathv with the views
and policies which he expressed.By
actual count he was interrupted by
appluse twenty-nine times. Unless
I fail utterly to read the signs aright
the lection will develop into a land
slide for Bursum. Everywhere he
is gaining in strength and rising
steadily in the estimation and res
pect of the people of the state. He

Trinidad C. de Baca is the nephew
of E. C. de Baca, junior member of
the firm of McDonald & de Baca.
E. C. de Baca is the Democratic
candidate for governor this tjm
W. C McDonald, the senior mem
ber, modestly offering himself for
the post of lieutenant governor.
However, McDonald has assured the
people that, if elected, the firm will
keep on doing business on the same
old policy of "ourselves; relatives
and 'deserving democrats' next and
the public be ding-busted. "Mc
Donald has repeatedly put it in this
wise : "De Baca will make the
same kind of a governor I hare
been."
How true, how true.
Therefore there Is no doubt in
the world but that if the voters
again book McDonatd & de Baca
for their travesty on good and just
government at the state capitol, Tri
nidad C de Baca will be a member
of the cast the original cast much
improved by "travel and expenses".
Doubtless it will be possible to
advertise him
as more exnensire
tllan vef before."
