Beware, yo Halloween frollckers. for
tho youth of Washington will bo re

Tho rcrnoval of signs and front gates,
the uso of tick-tacks and putty blowers,

With tho price of wheat soaring, the

PLOT LAID TO CARMNZA'S
The Mexican opponents of the de facto government of
Mexico would be only too glacl to complicate the relations
between the United States and Mexico.
Our information is that they think'this an appropriate
time to do so. The statement made by the department
ought to discourage any such adventure on their part in
tihat direction. From a statement today by Secretary oj War

Secretary of 8tate learning nnd Sec
retary of War Baker today amended
the sensational statement Issued last
night which charged Administration
enemies with plotting an attack on an
American army camp or a new border
raid, to Influence the coming election.
When It was seen that tho press gen
erally construed Secretary Baker's
statement as a charge of treasonable ac
tivity on the part of American cltlicns,
tho two Cabinet ofllcers, speaking for
the Administration, mado an emphatic
denial that any such charges were In
tended. Secretary Lansing authorized tho fol
lowing statement:
"Secretary Baker's statement was
not for the purpose of creating political
sentiment In nny way. It wns for tho
purpose of discouraging attacks to stir
up trouble."
No Charge Against Americans.
Secretary Lansing added thcro was no
thought of charging Amerlcnns with re
sponsibility for these plots. He said:
"I cannot conceive of any American
citizen who could be so heartless, so
wanton, nnd so unpatriotic as to take
n step that would Involvo American
life."
Secretary Baker was equally emphatic.
Asked if ho thought political enemies
of the United States In this country had
any part In the plots he charged, tho
Secretary said:
"Oh. dear, no. it's unthinkable."
Secretary Baker added that many
Mexicans who had withdrawn from

Tex., Oct. -7. All tho commanders of
the big army camps along the border
have been warned by the Southern De

tack or attacks which Secretary Baker
charges havo been planned by Mexi
cans. Tho commanders wero ordered
to dlssemlnote tho warning to every
organization on tho border.
At General Funston's headquarters It
Was said no redistribution of the troops
on tho border would be necessary, as
the cavalry, artlllory. and infantry or
ganizations are believed to bo so sta
tioned now as to be able successfully to
copo with any situation that might
arise.
General Funston, who has been on a
duck-hunting expedition at Corpus

return to Fort Sam Houston tomorrow

that the situation as outlined by Secre

any change in General Funston's plans.

der, and It Is believed they furnished
the Information.
San Antonio has heard considerable
about plans made by Carranza's op
ponents to mke a demonstration nfter
