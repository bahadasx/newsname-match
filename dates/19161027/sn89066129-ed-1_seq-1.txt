Annoyed by Hunters
Farmers are already complaining
of hunters invading their lands
and endangering the stock. It is
a punishable offense to enter en
closed premises whether posted or
not without permission from the
owner or one iu charge. The fact
of having hunter's license does not
give a person permission to go
where they please in search of game
and to do so may prove expensive.
Help the School Library
The students of the Laclede
high school are making a canvass
of the town today for donations of
books to the school library. There
are, no doubt, many books about
town that have been discarded
from private libraries that would
be of real value to the school.
Hunt them up and have them
ready and if the solicitors should
happen to miss you phone Prof.
Crookshank or his assistants and
the books will be sent for.

letter from a friend requestiug yon

scheme is a fraud and your letter
will be returned by the federa
