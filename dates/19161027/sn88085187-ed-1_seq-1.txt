MUM! THAT
IS HUGHES
ON ALASKA
Republican state Chairman Fred 0. Har
per says that National Republican Chairman
VV. K. Wilcox says that Candidate Charles B.
Hughes authorizes him to say he has no inten
tion of abandoning the Alaska railway or
battleship construction program at Bremer
ton.
IS COY. HUGHES TONGUE-TIEDI
WHY DOESN'T HE SPEAK FOR HIM
SELF 1
He had an opportunity—a most splendid
opportunity when he visited Puget sound, the
gateway to Alaska — to declare himself defin
itely on the Alaska railroad question and on
the navy yard question.
People here wanted to hear him say he was
free of the Guggenheim influence in Alaskan
polities.
John E. Ballaine, who made his race for con
gress in the Seattle district on the Alaskan is
sue, met Hughes in Spokane, rode with him to
Seattle, talked Alaska with him, tried to im
press upon him its importance to the North
west.
What did Hughes say?
Nothing.
Tacoma wanted to hear from Hughes on the
Bremerton navy yard program. It wanted to
hear that he was a believer in government con
struction. Taeoma knew very well that the
itandpat gang behindTHughes was the element
which fought the Bremerton project, knew
that Senator Weeks, of Massachusetts, who
led the fight against it in the senate, was men
tioned for secretary of the navy under Hughes,
knew that the shipbuilding trust was against
government construction.
And the Northwest wanted to hear from
Hughes' lips that he was free of that baneful
influence, free to fight for the government pro
jects.
What did Hughes say?
Nothing.
And he still says nothing.
Government ownership ami operation in
Alaska and in our navy yards aro fundamental
propositions. Hughes is either for the great
principles of government ownership or he is
opposed to them. We have a right to hear his
Own words from his own lips.
But it's Charles Evasion Hughes again.
The state chairman says the national chair
man says Hughes authorized him to say—
Oh, fiddlesticks!

NEW YORK. Oct. l~t. — The
Maritime ICxchange this afternoon
received a message reporting ilie
French liner Chicago afire at sea.
"Steamship Chicago, Kren.-'i,
hound from Bordeaux to New
York, fire in number 3 hold,"
read the menfiHge. "Expects ar
rive at Payal, Azores islands, to
day."
The Chicago left Bordeaux Sun
, day for New York and should
have been several hundred miles
west and north of. the Azores to
day. I'nder ordinary conditions
she carried 250 to 300 passengers
on her western trip.
She is a 14,000 ton steamer,

RAID ON
STEAMER
FAILURE
Acting on advance informa
tion from San FranciHCO, a dozen
police and sheriff's officers
boarded the steamer Grace Dol
lar as she moored at the Puget
Sound Lumber company's docks
at 11 o'clock Friday, and search
ed the Bhlp from stem to stern
for liquor. -
Instead of finding 50 cases of
600 quarts, as they had expected,
the officers unearthed Just three
quarts of whisky in the entire
ship.
None of the officers or crew of
the Grace Dollar would claim
ownership, so the liquor was
taken to police headquarters.
The Grace Dollar came empty
from Ban Francisco, to return
with a cargo of lumber.

FOR NEW
POLITICAL
FREEDOM
The nonpartisanship bill initiated at Olym
pia by Councilman Oliver T. Eriokson, of Se
attle, calls for a new political freedom.
It calls for a complete freedom for the peo
ple of Washington from party slavery.
It is designated to give every \»»i<*r unlimit
ed opportunity to choose office holden n i-
KardJess of the national political beliefs tlu iy
hold and to prevent little men from slipping
into office merely on the strength of party
labels.
Ward heelers, political manipulators and
hand-pickers of every sort will fight this bill.
They are unanimously opposed to putting
county and state offices on the same progres
sive plane as Taeoma and practically all the
other cities of the stale moved up to several
years ago.
And yet there is no reason in the world why
I coroner, a comity auditor or a governor
should be elected on the platform of sonic na
tional party.
Each of these offices should be filled with
the one idea of selecting the most efficient
man available.
Now it is up to the secretary of state and at
torney general to prepare a ballot title for this
bill.
It" they act with reasonable promptness
they can finish the task in plenty of time for
the petition to be signed by the voters on
election day. If they pursue 1 heir usual policy
of dilly-dally and procrastinate the obtaining
of signatures will be somewhat delayed and
made more difficult. Voters, watch how these
two officials act.
In the meantime let every progressive
minded and independent citizen "talk up"
this bill among his friends. Prepare for a
whirlwind campaign to obtain 100,000 names
on the petition.
Such a list would be a virtual command to
the legislature, and would insure that the bill
pass this coming winter instead of being sub
mitted to vote two years hence.
