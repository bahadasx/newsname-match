LOCAL AND GENERAL NEWS
Some of It May Interest You; All
Of It Is Worth a Perusal
Political Preferences of The News
The News heartily endorses the
candidacy of Miss Dee M. Moss
for the office of county recorder
on the democratic ticket. Miss
Mo3S is now closing her first
term in that office, and the en
viable record the office has en
joyed for efficiency, and courteous
treatment of the public.-entitles
h3r to re-election. Not alone have
P3ople of her own political faith
bsen accorded considerate treat
ment, but members of all politi
cal parties have fared as well.
The fact that the republicans of
the county had difficulty in find
ing any candidate willing to
make the race against Miss Moss,
is evidence that they consider it
impossible to defeat her. The
News predicts that Miss Moss
will lead her ticket and that her
majority will be large.
Professor Joseph Peterson,
democratic candidate for superin
tendent of schools, is another
candidate seeking re-election who
has made good in office. Since
he entered upon the duties of
the office, the efficiency in the
schools of the county have in
creased more than a hundred
per cent, and today they rank as
high as those of any county in
the state. Prof. Peterson has
spent years in school work, he
believes in advanced and up-to-date
methods and he is worthy
of another term. The News pre
dicts that his majority will be a
large one.
On the theory that one good
term deserves another, Fay I.
Gardner, democratic candidate
for assessor, should be re-elected
to another term. In another
column of this paper Mr. Gardner
publishes a signed communica
tion to the voters of the county.
He renders a detail statement of
the assessor's office during his
incumbency, and this is worthy
the careful oersual of every
reader of the paper. No one fami
liar with all the facts can charge
Mr. Gardner either with incom
petency or favoritism, and the
voters should retain him in office
for another term.
The News believes that the re
publicans have nominated the
bast men for the state assembly.
J.E. Richards for the lower house
is a man of broad intelligence
and he is well qualified te- fill
' the office to Which he aspires. E.
T. Fanning is a railroad conductor
and has had experience in legis
lative affairs. The election of
these two men to represent Nava
jo county in the state assembly
will be a wise thing for the
voters to do.
The election of sheriff in Nava
jo county will be determined by
the two factors of party prefer
ence of the voters and personal
popularity of the candidates.
Both the democratic and the re
publican candidates have a per
sonal following which will vote
for them regardless of party af
filiations. Each has been sheriff
of the county and each has at
tended to the duties of the office
in an acceptable manner. The
business of the office will be safe
in the management of either Mr.
Newman or Mr. Woods.
Change in Electric Service
Beginning Oct. 25 the Hol
brook Light & Power Co. will
give a 20 hour service daily,
starting at 1 p. m., and ending
at 9 a. m. This service will be
continued for 30 days from above
mentioned date, as a trial propo
sition. If found to be appreciated
by the patronage of the public it
will be continued permanently
and will later be made a 24 hour i
service.
Mr. Baird, local manager for
the company, wishes to announce
that he will be glad to demon-
strate at any time to the patrons
of the company the irons,
toasters, cookers and other
electric appliances, which the
company carries in stock. Call
him for appointment.
Rousing Republican Rally
.A republican rally was held in
the Pastime theater Wednesday
night. A large crowd of people
attended and most of them re
mained until the last speaker had
closed his discourse.
Preceding the speaking several
Í reels
of moving pictures were
shown in which various im
portant issues in the national
campaign were set forth in at
tractive form.
W. H. Clark, secretary of the
county central committee pre
sided and introduced each speaker
in turn. Following in the order
named were: Henry L. Eads.
candidate for congress; Doane
Merrill, candidate for state au
ditor; H. E. Matthews, candidate
for superintendent of public inst
ruction; Geo. H, Smalley, candi
date for tax commissioner; John
L. Gust, candidate for attorney
general; and Tom Campbell,
candidate for governor.
While each of the preceding
speakers made good arguments
in favor of his candidacy, it re
mained for Mr. Campbell to make
the principal speech of the even
ing. Mr. Campbell made a splen
did argument in favor of his
election to the office of chief ex
ecutive and in doing so he handled
the present state administration
without gloves. From the start
to the close of his speach he held
the attention of his audience and
without doubt made votes for
him3elf and his ticket.
Navajo County Wins Premiums
F. J. Willis, fair commissioner
for Navajo county, returned
Monday evening from Prescott
where he had exhibited a fine
collection of agricultural and
horticultural products secured
from growers in this county. To
the New3 Mr. Willis expressed
himself as being well pleased
with the showing made, and the
premuims secured; he also feels
very grateful to farmers and
others in the county who so ma
terially assisted him in prepar
ing the exhibit.
Outside of Yavapai county,
Navajo county's exhibit was the
best at the fair. In the sweep
stakes class this county received
first premuim on the best dry
farm agricultural and horticult
ural products; also first for the
best display of forage crops
grown by one person, and sec
ond premuim on the largest
vegetable display.
The county was awarded first
and second prizes on wheat;
first on oats, barlev, millet,
sorghum, Mexican beans and
best three watermelons. Second
on mushmelons, red and yellow
onions, and first and second on
apples.
A special ribbon was awarded
to Hans Hansen of Lakeside on
strawberries; to Don Smith of
Snowflake on dry farm potatoes
and to F. J. Willis of Linden for
the largest pumpkin. The town
of St. Joseph exhibited the lar
gest head of cabbage.
Navajo county showed up well
on many other varieties of pro
ducts, taking first on four dif
ferent kinds of corn, and on
oats, rye, wheat and millet in
sheaf.
Communities represented in
the exhibits were St. Joseph,
Snowflake, Linden, Showlow,
Lakeside and Pinedale.
Superior Court News
Last Monday in superior court
Judge Sapp sentenced Alberto
Chavez to pay a fine of $100 and
serve one year in jail, upon a
plea of guilty to the charge of
bootlegging. The jail sentence
was suspended upon payment of
the fine.
On the same day Harry John,
the Navajo Indian arrested two
weeks before by Lew H. Mickey,
live stock inspector, for stealing
a cow from G. W. Hennessey,
was sentenced to serve from 2 to
5 years in the state penitentiary.
Rex Smith left that night for
Florence with the Indian.

State Fair News
The recent activity of our old
friend Villa has put a quietus on
the motor cycle race from Her-
mosillo, Mexico to Phoenix. This
race "was framed with the thou
ght that the spirit of sportsman
ship entering therein would heal
some of the little fractures of
friendship which sundry actions
of our aforementioned friend
Villa had caused. But one can
not possiblv be friendly with a
chap who shoots first and then
asks questions, so, upon the ad
vice of several well informed
Americans and Mexicans the
taboo was put on any race that
took the racers onto Mexican
soil.
Then some one had the bril
liant idea of increasing the in
terest in the northern portion of
our own state and the wires were
at once used by Secretary
Shaughnessy of the State Fair
Commission to find out what
cities of the North wished to ex
tend help in making the road
race a success. He wired Craig
Pottinger of Flagstaff asking if
Flagstaff could raise three hun
dred dollars if that city were
made a night control station and
it only took a very few minutes
for Pottinger to answer that
Flagstaff not only could but
would raise the necessary coin.
Then the starting point was
talked of and Springerville was
chosen so thus the race that was
to have been the Hermosillo
Phoeix has changed its cognomen
to the Northern Arizona Spring
erville to Phoenix Classic.
This is a good thing for Nor
thern Arizona as every motor
cycle paper and magazine will
report the race and thus the
towns along the way as well as
the National Old Trails Highway
will come in for their need of
publicity.
All of the motor cycle factor
ies - best riders will be in this
event and it will be watched by
every motor enthusiast in the
country.
The route to be followed will
be as follows. Springerville
start, Nov. 9th-St. Johns, Hol
brook, Winslow. Flagstaff-night
control. Start, Nov. 10th Flag
staff, Williams, Ashfork, Pres
cott, Congress, Wickenburg,
Phoenix.
That will bring the boys into
Phoenix on the afternoon of the
10th and give them a sufficiency
of time to fit up their machines
for the' big track races to be held
at the Fair, Monday, the 13th.
the crowning event of which will
be the open international one
hour championship, held under
the auspices of the Federation of
American Motor, cyclists. This
is the first time Arizona has ever
drawn one of the three big year
ly events of the F. A. M. and
it will mean a race such as has
never been seen in the state be
fore. Riders from all over the
world are eligable and doubtless
some of the most famous drivers
in the world will come to Ari
zona to compete.

Newman will be Sheriff Again
Sheriff R. L. Newman, the
young man of Navajo county
who has made the laws of that
county mean what they said as
far as lawyers and judges would
construe them, was in Flagstaff
Tuesday visiting old time friends
aside from a small matter of
criminal business.
Lee has been a resident of
Northern Arizona since 1877,
the greater portion of which
time he spent in Coconino and
Navajo counties in the sheep
and cattle business. He is again
in the race for sheriff in our
neighboring county and has
many friends over here, both re
publican and democratic who are
willing to testify to his sturdy
character and ability to deliver
the goods no matter how hard
the proposition he may be up
against.
In Navajo county he has at
tained the reputation of enforc
ing the laws just as they are
written so far as he is concerned,
letting them hit or hurt as they
would, claiming that it was what
he was elected for, and not to
sav what should or should not
have been the law.
Old time boyhood friends over
in this section of the country feel
a rriendly interest in his cam
paign from a personal stand
point and are willing to wager
on his ability, integrity and
loyalty to his constituents at any
point along the line of duty.

Friendly to Labor Unions
The undersigned wishes to
brand as false statements made
in the Snowflake Herald of Octo

High Cost of Living," in which
he is charged with being un -

There is absolutely no truth in
the charge. I have always been
a friend of unions, believing the
workingman can get his rights
in no other way. The article re

JOSEPH H. KIBBEY
Republican Candidate
For U. S.
Senator
A Man of Deeds
Arizona is soon to vote on the
candidacy of a man who, when
governor, devoted extremely lit
tle time to palaver, and still less
to pulling the wool over the eyes
of the labor unions, but a great
deal to action. He is former
Gov. Joseph H. Kibby, candidate
for the United States senate,
who prevented one great labor
strike by telling each side in
short words exactly what to ex
pect, and who "intervened" in
Mexico with no fus3 but with
great effectiveness.
Gov. Kibbey's act of "inter
vention" is little known, com
paratively. On June 1, 1906, the
Cananea strike developed in
which several thousand Mexi
cans, led by Gutierrez de Lara and
Manuel Dieguez, now a Carranza
general, left their employment,
. and in their effort to close down
: the entire mining works, began
h rioting which Col. Bill Greene
did his best to check
and in
which two Americans lost their
lives. A reign of terror followed.
The Mexicans, while rioting, de
clared their intention of driving
every American out of camp.
There were many hundreds of
Americans then in Cananea, by
far the larger number unarmed,
and from June 1 to June 3 they
were in great peril.
Word of their plight reached
the American border and at Bis
bee a posse of 600 men was or
ganized to go to their relief.
Capt. Tom Rynning of the Ari
zona Rangers was chosen tohead
the force, but before accepting
he felt bound to consult his su
perior officer, the governor of
the state. Capt. Rynning wired
Gov. Kibbey for instructions and
wa3 ordered to make all possible
speed to the rescue of the Amer
icans. The band of Americans enter
ed Mexico at Naco, very much
against the will of the Mexican
officials there, and they went
right down the railroad to Can
anea. Their coming put an im
mediate end to the rioting-, and
they held the camp until Mexi
can control was restored. It so
happened that Col. Emilio Kos
terlitzsky, who was in command
of the Sonora rurales, and whose
chief job was sitting on the lid
at Cananea, was absent with
most of his men when the riot
ing broke out. Otherwise there
would have been no rioting, for
evil inclined Mexicans were more

of Gen. Torres himseif, and Gen.
Torres meant Diaz in those days.
Kosterlitzsky came back to the
camp in a hurry, and Capt.
Rynning and his men turned the
situation over to the rurales,
The possemen sold their guns to
the American population and re
turned to Bisbee, and the trouble
was over.
Gov. Kibbey deserved, by rea
son of his decisive stand, to
share the credit with Rynning
and his men. His whole record
has been filled with deeds quiet
ly accomplished. And yet it is
possible that a man of words,
rather than one of action, may
be elected to the senate. El
Paso Herald-October 15, 1916.

Hughes' 8 Hour Law
Warning Recalled
New York, Oct. 17. Com
mentinR on the official admission
of Warren S. Stone, grand chief
of the Brotherhood of Locomo
tive Engineers, one of the four
men chiefly responsible for the
enactment of the so-called Adam
son eight hour law, that he does
not know "just what the Adam
son bill means." the republican
national committee in a state
ment last night said:
"The day before Mr. Stone
and his colleagues signed this
circular Charles E. Hughes dis
cussed the Adamson law in a
speech at Newark, N. J.
" 'Hasty legislation is likely
to carry with it unwelcome sur
prises,' said Mr, Hughes. 'If
eight hours is to be a "measure
or standard of a day's work" for
the purpose of reckoning the com
pensation to be paid, how are
these men left who complete
the prescribed number of miles
m less than eight hours. There
is much food for thought in this
legislation, not only on the part
of those men for whom it does
not provide but also on the part
of those to whom it expressly
refers.'
"It is apparent from the state
ment of the circular sent out by
Mr. Stone and his colleages that
they are beginning to do some
of the thinking about the Adam
son law which Mr. Hughes sug
gested that they do in his Newark
speech. And they are finding
that the law is not clear as it
might be. They are beginning
to pay one of the penalties for
haste.
"But there is one man who af
fects to know just what the
Adamson iaw means, and inas
much as it was his surrender to
the threat of a strike by the
brotherhoods that drove the bill
through congress he certainly
ought to know all about it, and
especially what it means. He is
President Wilson. Time and
time again since he signed the
bill with four gold pens, and gave
one to each brotherhood chief as
a sacred souvenir, he has pro
claimed in public his satisfaction
with this 'eight hour law,' as he
always describes It, as an accom
plishment of service to labor and
humanity.
"Since Mr. Stone and his col
leages are in such doubt as to
the meaning and application of
the law, why don't they apply to
Mr. Wilson for real information?
Is there anything in theirexperi
ence with him which has caused
them to begin to doubt his omni
science? Candidates can get cards or
circular letters printed at the
News office.

TOM CAMPBELL
4&M
A Clean Candidate
Reports from all over the state
show that Tom Campbell has
been making tremenduous gains
in every section of the state and
his election by from 2500 to 3500
majority is absolutely assured.
Tom Campbell has been mak
ing a clean campaign. He has
been winning Democratic votes
everywhere. Thousands of De
mocrats are today wearing the
Campbell button. They re
cognize that he is effiicient,
coarageous and independent, and
see in him the only hope of re
deeming their party from the
Hunt machine.
A great body of Democrats in
the state feel that Hunt has had
enough favors at the hands of
their party, having occupied the
governor's chair for five years.
They believe that Tom Campbell
will not give the state a partían
administration such as Hunt has
done but will be the governor of
fhe whole people.
The Democratic leaders them
selves realize that Hunt is slip
ping every day. They are re
sorting to desperate tactics to
stem the rising tide of sentiment
in favor of Tom Campbell.
It has been demonstrated that
the state of Arizona is more in
dependent than Democratic. A
few hundred votes changed in
previous elections would have
elected Republican governors
had the Republican party been
united as it is today. Twenty
thousand registered voters did
lot go to thé polls at the last
election and five thousand of
those who did go did not vote for
governor. With a president to
be chosen and widespread inter
est in the state, it is certain that
bic vote will be cast and that
the silent vote will be almost un
animous for Tom Campbell.
Democrats everywhere are
conceding that Tom Campbell is
as good as elected today.
H. E. Matthews Makes a Big Hit
H. E. Matthews, candidate for
superintendent of public instruc
tions, has been one of the hits of
the campaign. Mr. Matthews
knows what he talks about public
schools. He is a polished speak
er and his diction is perfect.
He says what he will do if elect
ed to the position he seeks. He
advocates constructive policies.
Over 52 per cent of the money
derived from taxes is spent on
the public schools and the tax
payers' interests will be safe in
the hands cf an experienced and
conscientious educator of Mr.
Matthews' type.
John L. Gust, for Attorney General
Is one of the brilliant young
awyers ot the state, tie has
always supported practical pro
hibition laws, but has never up
braided or denounced those who
thought differently. He has al
ways favored Woman's Suffrage,
has supported the rights of
labor, believes that more liber
ality should be shown to capital
engaged in useful pursuits, and
has never been in politics' or a
candidate for public office before.
He is a successful attorney at
Phoenix.
