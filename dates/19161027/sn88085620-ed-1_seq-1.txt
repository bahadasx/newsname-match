I. W. W. APPEAL
"That's an interesting but sad hit
of reading reproduced from the Seattle
1. W. W. organ, 'Solidarity,' and pub
lished elsewhere in this issue. The
plea calls for fundi and faces —funds
for the agitators of the organization
and new faces that will get by the
keen inspection of the Everett citizens
committee.
"All the faces that have heretofore
been sent to Everett have left their
marks here on the saps or knuckles
ot Sheriff Mcßae and his officers and
citizen deputies and consequently
tin y are of no additional use here, the
statement asserts.
"Besides their owners would just, as
soon take their faces to some other
town where the citizens are not so
thoroughly organized and not so firmly
resolved that the peace of the com
munity shall not be jeopardized by a
lot of lusty lunged agitators.
" 'We must put Everett on the I.
W. W. map,' says the plea of the
'Everett Free Speceh Committee.'
"If the committee will take another
slant at that I. W. W. map it will see
that Everett already is there in large
letters and in equally large letters are
the words, 'Danger. No place for
agitators.' "
The foregoing is an editorial in the
Everett Tribune last Saturday.
The Tribune seems much concerned
about the few members of the I. W.
W. who came, to Everett either of their
own motion or by the invitation, or
.some act, of the open-shoppers. It
admits the brutality with which the
members of this organization were
treated.
The Tribune and its backers did not
make war on the I. W. W. for the
reasons it would have its readers be
lieve, but for the purpose of throttling
free speech only when uttered by the
cohorts of open-shop-ism.
The real fight is made upon the
Shingle Weavers' Union in particular
and all unions in general.
The unions have little or nothing in
common with the I. W. W„ but they
are willing that all men may exercise
their constitutional right of free
speech. They believe in it.
"Incendiary utterances" should not
be confounded with "free speech," but
if they are to be prohibited and pun
ished, the attention of law officers is
called to many inflammatory speeches
made on the floor of the Everett Com
mercial Club, that uninvited, vicious
meddler in the industrial affairs of
Everett working men. The club took
a hand in a game wherein it did not
even possess a single white check.
But the Tribune cannot see anything
like that.
"Lusty lunged agitators" of the
Commercial Club are a self-appointed
committee of unsafety—disturbers of
the peace and good will which should
and would exist in this community if
the club would adopt a policy of fair
play and at least gently chide the
bombastic bunch which now seems to
control and run the organization.
Don't "holler yer head off" about
agitators. If it were not for them
there would be no organizations of
any kind—not even churches.

GOV. LISTER SEES THE
ERROR OF HIS WAY
Governor Lister attached his signa
ture on five of the reactionary legis
lative acts, but since his attention has
been called to the Clayton act, now a
federal statute, he not only sees the
viciousness of the anti-picketing refer
endum measure, whicli he signed, but
all the rest of the seven sinful statutes
and the constitutional amendment.
The Seattle Union Record of the 21st
says:
"In a signed statement read before
the great Wilson rally In the Metro
politan Theatre Friday evening, Oc
tober 20, Governor Ernest Lister came
out flat-footed against the seven refer
endum measures and the constitu
tional amendment to be voted on No
vember 7. In this action the governor
has gone far to rehabilitate himself
with organized labor and has thrown
consternation into the camp of the
enemies of popular rule. His complete
statement, given the Union Record in
advance of any other publication, is as
follows:
STATEMENT BY GOV. LISTER
"There should be no division in the
ranks of the believers in popular gov
ernment in this campaign. Whatever
doubt there may be in the minds of
some as to the several referendum
measures proposed, there can be no
question as to the character of the
forces definitely aligned in their sup
port.
"The rule of safety demands united
action. Several of the measures pro
posed are vicious in the extreme, and
threaten the destruction of the entire
plan of the Initiative, Referendum,
Recall and Direct Primary. If the
issue becomes clouded or vague, these
measures may succeed. Under the
circumstances, it seems to me to be
the safe course that the forces of pop
ular government should oppose, with
out exception, all of the Referendum
Measures now before the people.
"Eight measures passed by the last
republican legislature have been re
ferred to a vote of the people of the
State of Washington to be passed on
at the coming election on November 7.
Among these laws are Referendum
Measures Nos. 3 and 4, directed
against the Initiative, Referendum and
Recall, and No. 5, directed against the
Direct Primary. These three meas
ures I consider are among the most, if
not the most, pernicious laws ever
passed by the legislature in this state
against the fundamental rights of the
people under our popular government.
"The masses of the people of this
state, under the direction of organiza
tions composed of men and women
interested in advancing and protecting
the rights of the common man under
our institution of popular government,
have banded themselves together for
the purpose of defeating these three
measures, and all other measures now
being referred to the people of this
state. On the other hand, there can
be no dispute as to the character of
the forces united in support of all
these referred measures intended to
curtail the principle of popular gov
ernment.
"My attention has been called to the
provisions of the Clayton Act recently
enacted by a democratic national con
gri ss. This act clearly defines the
respective rights of labor and capital
in their several disputes. The general
plan there outlined I can give, and do
give, my unqualified approval. My
own personal record as a workman
and associate member of labor or
ganizations, and my entire record as
a public man, clearly emphasizes to
everyone that feeling of sympathy
which I have for the cause of labor.
"Notwithstanding the position for
merly taken by me in respect to Ref
erendum Measure No. 6, known as the
Anti-Picketing Bill, and after mature
consideration of the drastic provisions
of this measure, and in the light of
the scope of the Clayton Act, passed
by a democratic congress and ap
proved by President Wilson, which in
my opinion and in the opinion of or
ganized labor goes far to compose
the differences between labor and
capital, I shall unite with the forces
mentioned above to urge the defeat
of this, and all other measures re
ferred to the people at this election."
Now, you stand-patters who wish the
fact,
All should read the Clayton act,
and you may then see the error of
your way.
"While lhe lamp holds out to burn
The vilest sinner may return."
Why doesn't the daily press publish
Lister's full statement.
Be careful about your vote. DON'T
vote for the seven referendum meas
ures —vote against them.

SECRETARY OF STATE
A LAW VIOLATOR
I. M, Howell, secretary of state,
candidate for re-election, has shown
himself to be a partisan of the most
dangerous type.
In his eagerness to secure the pas
sage of the seven referendum meas
ures and the constitutional amend
ment he has attempted to evade the
law by writing the ballot titles so as
to deceive the voters into believing
they were voting against the measures
when in reality they were voting for
them.
It was necessary to bring a suit
against Howell to compel him to place
Against Candidates and Particularly Legislative
Candidates Who Will Not Denounce the
Seven Referendum Measures and the
Constitutional Amendment
proper and legal titles on the ballots, j
Even after he gave his promise to
i serve the law he attempted to evade
and violate it.
What the Law Prescribes
The law prescribes that the ballot
title shall be framed by the attorney 1
general, presumambly a disinterested
party, so that it shall not favor either
side of the controversy, but shall
state in clear and simple language,'
impartially, the purpose of the meas
ure. The law requires that after this!
ballot title is formulated it shall be'
placed at the head of each initiative
and referendum petition, and that it
shall go on the ballot as the matter
describing what the proposed meas
ure is.
What effrontery this man Howell
displays in asking the people to re-
Against Nos. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9

Constitutional Amendment
elect him to an office he has dis
graced by his brazen attempts at vio
lation and evasion of the laws he has
sworn to uphold and execute!
TELL THE JOURNAL HOW
YOU STAND
Fifty-four candidates for the legis
lature have notified Miss Lucy R. Case
of Seattle that they will vote and
work against the seven referendum
measures and the constitutional
amendment. Snohomish and four other
counties have not answered for the
reason that the auditors of these coun
ties have not furnished Miss Case
with a list of Iheir legislative candi

Candidate Hughes comes out In tin
open. The American Federation of
Labor is not only against war. but it
has used its great Influence for the
purpose of preventing war. During
the last four or five years there have
been a number of situations created
which Indicated close proximity to the
intervention of the United States In
Mexico. On each of these occasions
the influence of the general labor
movement has co-operated with the
Mexican labor movement for the pur
pose of exercising the influence of
these two great national bodies
against war. Up to the present mo
ment the efforts of labor have been
entirely successful.
President Wilson has indicated
very clearly by his handling of deli
cate diplomatic situations and by his
public utterances that he is opposed
to war as long as there is a single
avenue left to avert it. Kx-l'resident
Roosevelt is the chief jingo of .Mr.
Hughes' supporters, but Mr. Hughet
failed to take any definite position
upon the question of war until heckled
by a Louisville, K> . audience a few
days ago. Candidate Hughes then de
clared that had he been president at
the time the l.usitan a was sunk by a
j Submarine he would have broken off
diplomatic relations; in other words.
he would have declared war.

would seek any pretext as a sufficient

"A GOOD FRONT"
I.as' Saturday afternoon while the
e'i rks in the Btores were busy two'
customers walked into one of Everett's
Largest mercantile establishments. The
first was a good woman, very plainly
dressed, and the other looked quite
nifty. The first woman had been
waiting for some time when the sec
ond entered the store, but the plain
clothes of the first failed to attract
the attention of the clerks, so her new
coming sister in the glad rags was
waited upon first, by a bowing and
scraping clerk. The woman in tlie
glad rags bought GO cents' worth of
goods, then turned to her nervous,
neglected sister and helped her to get
the attention all customers are en
titled to. The plain clothes woman
bought goods to the value of $21.60.
! That was one time the better
dressed woman won on "a good front,"
but it was also one time a clerk was
J fooled by it, and ought to be fired for
it, in the interest of the store which
hired him.
"First come, first served" seems a
good motto in all sorts of dealings,
and if not observed all sorts of dealers
will lose money.
That clerk is probably a member of
the Commercial Club, seated in that
body by the favor of some one who
bought more seats than he needed.

stands alone as being sane and com
posed. Under trying circumstances
no man has shown such a broad grasp
of world affairs or has been able to
impress upon foreign governments his
declarations as has the president of
the United states.
The question therefore resolves it
self into one of two things war or
peace; and the American people are
soon to make their choice of which of
the two they aprove. The verdict of
the American people is confidently
awaited.

HARD KNOCKS FOR
REFERENDUM MEASURES
I Last Monday night at Liberty Hall,
James E. Bradford, progressive candi
> date lor governor, delivered a most
forceful, lucid and convincing address
against the seven referendum meas
ures and the constitutional amend
ment.
Mr. Bradford went deep into tlie
history of these measures, dissecting
them with a skill only possible with a
man thoroughly conversant with every
section of these infamous propositions.
He showed their origin, their hellish
aims, their unprecedented effrontery,
their utter shamelessness. He de
clared them an insult to the intelli
gence of a great majority of the peo
! pie of this state.
Mr. Bradford has repeatedly chal
lenged the advocates of these, or any
of these, measures to discuss them be
ifore any audience at any time in any
place. Would the sponsors and sup
porters of these attacks on the liber
ties of all the people, except the
beneficiaries of "special interests"
and the "privileged classes" in general,
dare meet him on the rostrum?
No, they dare not do it!
i These measures Mr. Bradford clear
ly shows emanated from public service
corporations and their hired tools.
They hope to secure enough dupes to
pass them at the election on Novem
ber 7. Will they be able to accom
plish their designs? We hope not.
The people have been asleep. Too
many of them are asleep yet. The
daily press treats these referendum
.measures as of minor importance.
The two older and larger political
! parties have no issues in this state,
judging by the campaign they are
carrying on. We hear nothing from
them except "You were a wet, but now
you are a dry"; "You were a dry, and
i now you are a wet," and such stuff as
j that. They were both tarred with the
' same stick.
There are seven legislative acts be
ifore the people which have for objects
!the robbing of the public, the disfran
chisement of the masses and the de
struction of labor organizations.
During the campaign little has been '
heard from the republican and demo-'
cratic leaders concerning these vicious
measures. The republican platform
endorsed them. The democratic plat
form evaded them. A few candidates
I
of both parties have had the courage
to denounce them. No candidate, to i
our knowledge, has had the hardihood
to endorse them.
One candidate for the high office of
governor, Ernest Lister by name, the
present incumbent of the office, signed
five of these measures, and last week,
feeling the pulse of the public and
i seeing "the handwriting on the wall."
J publicly denounced the w hole con
temptible batch. He says he didn't
understand them when he placed his
signature to them. Fine man to draw
la salary from the people for being In
competent to hold his job. That is the
| most charitable view of it.
In justice to Senator I'oindexter.
I Geo. F. Cotterill, Congressman Dill,
Mrs. Frances Axtell (democratic can
didate for congress in this district),
and best and most disinterested of'
them all. .tames E. Bradford (pro- 1
gressive candidate for governor),
openly and forcefully denounced these
acts of infamy.
We thank Mr. Bradford for his ef
forts in behalf of the people.

PRESIDENT OF
LINEMEN KILLED
.Member.- of Electrical Workers' Lo
cal .No. 77 were shocked to learn of
the death on Thursday afternoon, the
19th, of their president, YV. K. Thomas,
who accidentally came in contact with
a high ten-ion wire while working
near the auxiliary steam plant of the
city light department. Charles Cross,
Brother Thomas's helper, who is a
much smaller man than the deceased,
tore him loose from the wire after
frantic efforts. A pulmotor which ar
rived on the scene shortly after the
accident failed to work, and it was
45 minutes before another arrived. In
the meantime Brother Thomas had
breathed his last, and two hours' work
by physicians at the emergency hos
pital failed to revive him.
Brother Thomas had acted as presi
dent of Local Xo. 77 several times
in the past, and had been a member
for more than 15 years. He was the
I father of many new features intro
duced by Local No. 77, and was a great
advocate of high dues, believing that
an organization, to succeed, must have
finances to carry on its work. It was
largely due to his broad-mindedness
and deep insight into human nature
that the local dues reached and main
tained its present success. The law
regulating electrical overhead con
struction, a great boon to linemen,
was adopted largely as a result of his
vigorous backing.
Deceased leaves a wife and two
boys aged S and 10 years, a brother,

William Jones, members of Local Xo.

RUST WITHDRAWS FROM
PROGRESSIVE TICKET
Frank A. Rust, progressive candi
date for secretary of state, as he an
nounced at the meeting in Liberty
Hall Monday night, has withdrawn in
j favor of J. M. Tadlock of Monroe, dem
jOcratic candidate. He made the fol
lowing statement in the Seattle Star
"Howell's attitude of enmity to
wards the principles of the initiative
iand referendum make him a dangerous
man for that office.
"Secretary Howell has been com
pelled many times by mandamus pro
ceedings to do the things specifically
required by the statutes, and has on
various occasions attempted to juggle
ballot titles to deceive and confuse
the voters.
"The present state pamphlet issued
by Mr. Howell dealing with the in
itiative and referendum measures is a
most glaring example of his brazen
efforts to evade the law and mislead
the voters.
"My sole purpose in entering this
• race was to defeat this enemy of the
people, but I fear this would not be
accomplished with three candidates in
the field. I therefore shall from this
day cease to campaign for myself, but
, will go out and work hard, or harder
jif possible, tor the election of Mr.
Tadlock. who. by reason of wide ex
perience at newspaper, university and
other educational work, is eminently
qualified for this service.
"Whatever 1 may do in this cam
paign will he done without hope of
personal reward."
This may throw the majority of the
progressive vote to Tadlock. the demo
crat, but there are still three candi
dates in the field -socialist, demo
cratic and republican.
