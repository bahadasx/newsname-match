DEMOCRATIC COUNT CENTRAL COM.
Supper and Smoker to
Confederate Veterans
The Supper and Smoker given at
the home of Mrs. Anna Lloyd last
Friday evening by the John B. Gantt
Chapter of the United Daughters of
the Confederacy to a number of Con
federate Veterans, was a most de
lightful and enjoyable affair for the
old soldiers of the "Lost Cause." The
day and the evening were cold, raw
and unpropitious, for men whose ages
ranged from more than three score
and ten to four score years the
youngest being 73 years but there
were ten of the old boys who stepped
to the tune of Dixie present. But
for the cold and threatening weather
there would have been several more.
Those present were:
E. Meysenburg of Grafton, 111., Co.
E, Second Missouri Cavalry.
John W. Blue of Farmington, Co.
E, Second Missouri Cavalry.
Wm. H. Mitchell of Flat Kiver, Co.

Cavalry, was received and read:
Dickinson, Texas, Oct. 15.
J. M. Morris and Others:
Comrades: Your bugle call "to the
' ight into line!" greeted me on the
iright morn of the 14h instant, and
with all the thrill and impulse of the
ld soldier I longed to comply, but
alas, the many infirmities of four
score years past called the halt, and
with a sad heart I am forced to in
form you it is impossible; but be as
sured that if not in person, yet I will
be with you in heart, memory and
soul on that occasion. Please say to
the assembled comrades how earnest
ly I desired to be with them and again
shake the hands of "the tried and
true." Express to them my best
wishes for the balance of life's march,
and the hope to meet them in the bi
vouac "over the river."

The supper well when a lot of en
thusiastic women pat their heads and
culinary knowledge together to get up
a repast to tempt the most epicurean
taste and to excite the longing envy
of the dispeptic, you may rest assured
there is going to be a feast worthy
the gods. And that is what these old
fellows sat down to, and there were
no dispeptics among them. We have
verified this statement by the relish
with which they ate, the large amount
of everything that disappeared as if
by magic, and the chipper, bright
appearance each presented the morn
ing following.-
And it was well that "good diges
tion waited on appetite," for with a
whole host of charming, smiling
daughters beguiling them, pressing
this and that upon them, "do have
some of this," "why, you haven't eat
en anything let me help you to
some chicken," "you haven't tried
these sweet potatoes yet," and so on,
over and over, it is a wonder the old
heroes were not vanquished. But not
they! Ice cream and cake came charg
ing in phalanx, but the line of sturdy
old soldiers never wavered they
were veterans and coffee whose aro
matic flavor drowned and intoxicated
the senses.
An orchestra discoursed sweet mel
ody during the supper hour and the
"boys" pricked up their ears and
clapped their hands as the stirring
strains of "Dixie" filled the rooms, but
out of deference to the company they
refrained from giving the famous
rebel yell.
Then the smoker. From fragrant
Habanas floated clouds that curled and
drifted in rings and eddies Mrs.
Lloyd didn't care if Lady Nicotine did
brush with tawny fingers her lace cur
tains as the old soldiers reminisced,
recalling scenes and battles that they
are glad are only memories now,
paying tribute to some brave comrade
who fell 'mid blazing musketry and
screaming shell, the while laughing
over many funny experiences which
were also a part of the soldier life.
Enjoy it ; Indeed that evening will
remain with them as one of the sweet,
bright experiences of their halting
march toward the last camp and tat
too, when they shall lay them down to
rest to be awakened by the reveille
of eternal morn.
They did not essay any formal res
olutions of thanks to their gracious
hostesses, whose honored organiza
tion is purposed to keep green the
memory of the "Lost Cause," but
through one of their comrads ex
pressed with sincerest feeling their
earnest appreciation and love to the
daughters of John B. Gantt Chapter
for one of the pleasantest and most
memorable incidents of their lives.
Violin Solo Mrs. O. H. Duggins.

But at Same Time Attempts to Use It
In Unscrupulous Effort to Dis
credit Assessor Wells.
The Lead Belt News thinks it's
"sly, devilish sly," in quoting from
The Times' articles of last February
and March calling attention to the 1 iw
assessment of the lead companies in
comparison with that of farm and
other property, in an endeavor to dis
credit Assessor Wells. If we have
your attention we ask you to read on,
and we believe we can show you that
Mr. Wells has conscientiously en
deavored, and succeeded in a measure
that no other Assessor has, to per
form a difficult duty.
That the lead companies did es
cape a large share of the taxes that
they should have paid in the past we
believe has been clearly proved by
the exposition which The Times made,
and from which the Lead Belt News
so exultingly quotes. It docs not de
ny the truth of what The Times has
said. Those articles were written and
published to show the taxpayers that
a system of assessment had been in
vogue many years that was not equit
able and that the big wealthy lead
companies were not paying their just
proportion of taxes for the support of
the county government. They did not
cast any reflection upon Mr. Wells or
the Assessors who preceded him
Democratic or Republican only upon
a wrong system of assessment und a
precedent that had been In vogue con
scientiously, though mistakingly, be
cause on the face the system and prec
edent .had the appearance of being
rjght and proper.
Let us consider that system of as
sessing and the precedent of following
it, the inequality of which The Times'
articles exposed, just for a moment.
But first, permit us to remark paren
thetically, that The Times received no
assistance in the reform it was under
taking to bring about by a single
newspaper in the county; the Lead
Belt News didn't have a word to say
then, but now, when it imagines it
can make a little partisan capital out
of the facts given against a worthy
county official on the opposite side
of the poiitii i f .nee, it hops upon
and swallows them like a duck onto a
June bug.
It is well known that the St. Jo
seph and Doc Run lead companies had
had their agent at work for years spy
ing out and optioning tracts of land
which might possess mineral value,
putting their diamond drills to work
and buying up the land at the option
prices wherever a rich deposit was
shown. After their purchase they
placed their real value upon them raj
fixing their capitalization and in mak- j
ing their private reports to the com
patties' stockholders. They knew the
value of these lands and would not'
have parted with them for two or
three times the price at which they j
were bought, but on the surface they

production and hilly, rocky, unculti-i
vated wild lands, and had always been 1

Surplus Sale of Holstein Cows,

PLAN TO COME TO THIS SALE

high-class dairy herd.

assessed accordingly. As they were
unproductive and not developed by
the companies only held as valuable
assets the assessors continued to as
ses them by quarters, halves, sections,
metes and bounds at their former low
valuation.
The Assessors doubtless thought
they were making an equtable as
sessment. Their real value, which was
hidden from everybody but the com
panies, they had no way of estimat
ing, and they were assessed at what
their surface value and location
might indicate. The companies of
course held their own counsel and were
like any other tax-cfodger who might
hide his notes and stocks in a safe
deposit box where the Assessor would
never kiiow about them. That these
uncultivated, rocky and hilly lands
should be assessed as such seemed
reasonable and plausible, as it had
always been the custom to assess
lands by tracts, quarters, halves,
sections, metes and bounds accord
ing to their apparent surface value,
without reference to their accumula
tive and real worth when held by a
large corporation because of their in
trinsic value to such corporation and
to keep them from being bought up
and developed by other companies.
These companies never bought blind
ly; they knew what they were buying
and what a wealth of mineral lay hid
den underneath the rugged surfaces
of these lands.
It took The Times' exposition to
wake up not only the taxpayers gen
erally, but assest'ors as well, to the
fact that a stupendous amount of the
county's wealth was paying little or
no taxes and was being held up by
these companies so that it could not
be developed except at their pleasure
and convenience. Mr. Wells saw the
meaning and he began to increase the
companies' assessments not radical
ly, but conservatively and this year
they are assessed higher than they
have aver been and more in conform
ity with what they should be.
The companies are no pleased with
his worl of i ursi m' their organ
and too-willing mouth-pieces, like the
Lead Belt News, want to discredit and
if possible defeat Mr. Wells because
he is trying to do his duty in this
matter of making them bear their
just proportion of the taxes. If this
is not true, why are they so anxious
and desperate in their efforts to de
feat him and to put in his place one
of their confidential employes Tol
bert Henson?
Do the people of. the county want
these companies, with the assistance
of the Republican party organization
of the county, to foist upon them as
Assessor and members of the County
Court who constitute the Board of
Equalization men who are in their
employ or in close touch with them,
in order that they may have their
particular friends "in court" to favor
them?
Still They Come
