Chicago Facing
Famine in Labor
CHICAGO, Oct. 27-Chicago faces
famine in common labor, according to
the inspection department of the Illinois
state employment agency at Canal
Mreet near Madison. The greatest labor
mnrket in the I'mted States is being
tlowly deserted by employment agents,
who, for years, have exacted tribute for
jobs.
Instead of men paying for positions,
it was said today, railroads and other
big employers arc hiring agents who
go out and search for men. As a direct
tesull, Richard .1. Knight, labor inspec
tor, predicts a cut in the number of bis
investigators.
Railroad laborers are receiving $2.50

No Domestic Politics.
Secretary Lansing and Secretary
Hakcr today laid stress upon the state-
ment that no consideration of domestic
poll ics led to tne issue ot the an
nouncement that such a plot had been
discovered.
"The obviously appropriate comment
of the secretary of state." Secretary
Hakcf said, refetring to the explana
tion hv Secretary Lansiin last niirhf.
that no American w as implicated and
I that a desire to prevent the carrying;
out of the plans had prompted Secre
tary Baker's statement, "precludes the
possibility that any such construe ion
or understanding could be put upon my
statement.
Notice to Lawless Americana.
"The statement was without pohticat
purpose and ought to tie without po
litical effect. It will have served its
I entire purpose if it serves notice upon
j the lawless people in Mexico that we
'' prepared
I rd" to suppose that his statrmen- hal

cal inte-est in tbe L'nited States detirel
anything other than peace on the bor.

"Such a thing could not he" he said.
Movement Among Mexicans.
Asked lust what interest he charged
were behind the movement. Secretary
Haker dictated this statement :
"T' Mexicans who oppose the
de fa, to government in Mexico
would, of course, be glad to com
plicate irlations between the l'nited
States and Mexico and our infor
mation is that they think this ait
appropriate time to do so. The
statement made fast night by the
department ought to discourage
any adventure on their part in that
direction. F.verybody knows that
many Mexicans in this country are
constantly agitating against the de
facto government. Any sympathy
there may be on the American side
of the border with the movement
is wholly from this source.
"The only possible suggestion of
. a political purpose (in the war de
partment's statement) is to prevent
people in Mexiro from creating a
disturbance of a political character
in furtherance of their own de
sign." Hart of the information which led tu
his statement the secretary said reached
him yesterday afternoon within a few
minutes of the time he left to deliver
a campaign speech in West Virginia.
Advised By Lansing.
Mr. Haker, it was learned took his
advices up with fecrrtary Lansing and
the latter is said to have advised that
there be no delay in making public the
substance of the information
Secretary Lansing views the informa
tion, although somewhat indefinite ai
to individuals, as showing a dangerous
situation along the border.
I'ubliiation of the fait that the gov
ernment has taken steps to checkmate
such a movement, he believes, (joes far
toward pieventing an attack either o;t
a border town or uhu General Persh
ing's force.
Hinti at Retaliation.
Secretary Haker indicated that n.i
immediate movement of General Persh
ing's .columns were contemplated. He
refused to say, however, whether or
ders had been given to meet ail at
tack. He fave the impression that Gen
eral I'unston and Pershing might have
been directed to take certain steps of a
retaliatory nature, should an attack be
made upon their forces, or that the de
partment had Mich orders under coin
sidrration.
