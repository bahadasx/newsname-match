Germans, However, Predict
That Bucharest Will
Be Evacuated Soon
COUNTER ASSAULTS
AT VERDUN FAIL
'London, Oct. 26.—The situation of
the defeated Russo-Rumanian army in
Dobrudja appears slightly less critical
In the light of today's official report,
from Petrograd, which describes the
pressuie of Field Marshal von Mack
ensen's armies as somewhat weak
ened.
Unofficial Berlin dispatches say the
entente forces were split with the fall
of Tchernavoda, some troops escaping
over the great bridge across the Dan
ube while others fled northward in
Dobrudja.
As a whole the situation for Ruma
nia is considered by military commen
tators in Berlin as increasingly pre
carious, in connection with operations
In Dobrudja and the Austro-German
successes in the mountain passes on
the north. Predictions are made that
Bucharest will be evacuated shortly
and the Rumanian capital moved to
Odessa, Russia. Petrograd, however,
asserts that the Teutonic pressure also
,' has been arrested in these Transylvan
ian border regions. Further north in
the Carpathians near Capul mountain
,he Russians report the repulse of a
eutonic attack.

On the western front the Germans
are reported by Paris to have ceased
their counter attacks at Verdun. The
new French positions are still under
German artillery Are, however.
In Macedonia, French cavalry has
occupied the villages of Golobrda and
Lalsitsa, in the vicinity of the Greco
Albanian border, while the Serbians
have driven the Bulgarians and Ger
mans further back In the region of the
Cerna river southeast of Monastir, ac
cording to Paris. The British report
carrying out successful naval aero
plane-attacks on the railway stations
at Buk and Drama on the Constantly
ople-Saloniki railway.
GERMANS CONFIDENT.
Berlin. Oct. 26.—(By wireless to
Sayville)—"The capture of Tchernavo
da by Field Marshal von Mackensen's
army has definitely turned the military
situation in Dobrudja in our favor,"
writes the military critic ot the Over
seas News agency.
"The right wing of the combined
Bulgarian, German and Turkish force
marched on after the taking of Con
stanza and in a powerful push advanc
ed twenty kilometers (about twelve
miles) beyond that place. From that
moment the capture of Medjidie was
only a question of a few hours, as the
town was threatened on the flank. The
Russo-Rumanian position thus being
rolled up from the east, the western
point of support on the Danube, the
town of Rasova, also had to be given
up.
"With this situation brought about
the attacking Teutonic allies stood be
fore the strong Danube bridgehead of
Tchernavoda which then had to serve
as a cover for the hasty retreat of the
defeated Russians and Rumanians.
Today the railroad line from Constan
ta to Tchernavoda is completely In the
hands of the victorious allies, consti
tuting a first class base for strategic
operations.
"The defeated army was separated
Into two pkrts. Those who did not re
main on the battlefield or were not tak
en prisoner, saved themselves by flight
across the Tchernavoda bridge over
the Danube or to the north ward in
Dobrudja.
"After the capture of Tchernavoda
this famous Danube bridge was dom
inated by Von Mackensen's guns. The
bridge is the largest in all Europe, its
total length across both branches of
the Danube and the Swampy and fre
quently impassable terrain traversed
being seventeen kilometers. It was
completed in 1896.
"With the loss of the Constanza
Tchernavoda line by Rumania the
transport of provisions from Russia
will have to be conducted over two
minor and less efficiently equipped
railway lines in Moldavia or by way
of the Danube ports of Galatz and
'Ibraila. which are by no means com-
1
parable to Constanza. At the same
time the most important route for ar
tillery transportation by way of the
'railway from Constanza to Bucharest
is virtually eliminated. All shipments
must go by way of Ibraila and Plo
escl."

VILLA TRYING TO
TAKE CHIHUAHUA
SUCCESS FOR REBEL WILL MAKE
HIM DOMINANT IN NORTHERN
M£XICO.
Columbus, N. M., Oct. 26.—Villa
bandits operating near Namiquipa
only twenty-five miles south of the
American expedition's southern
outpost, have demanded the short
ening of the American troop line
and gradual evacuation of Mexi
can territory by the U. S. army»
Americans coming to the border
report.
Washington, D. C., Oct. 26.—Villis
t.as activity near Chihuahua had the ef
fect today of tonvinc.ing officials here
that no thought should be given to re
moval of guardsmen from border
patrol duty or withdrawal of General
Pershing's column from Mexico. Fear
was fe!t that if Villa should succeed
in his apparent movement to capture
Chihuahua, he might find it easy to
get control later of nearly all nqrthem
Mexico. The entire Mexican situation
was regarded as serious.
Conditions at Chihuahua were the
subject of greatly conflicting reports.
Mexican Ambassador Arredondo re
ceived from Consul Garcia at El Paso
a denial of General Trevino, Carranza
commander at Chihuahua, that he was
short of ammunition or intended to
evacuate the city. Carranza losses in
the fight with Villistas at Santa Ysa
bel had been slight, he said, and 8,000
troops had arrived to reinforce the
garrison.
War department reports, however,
were that Villa was encamped five
miles from Chihuahua with a consider
able force, after having defeated Car
ranza troops severely and that Tre
vino was ready to abandon the city.
CARRANZA LOSING GRIP.
Washington, D. C., Oct. 26.—Official
reports received here showing that
members of the Carranza, -Obregon,
Trevino, Huerta and Madero families
are now in San Antonio, Tex., have
puzzled observers seeking an explana
tion of the gathering, in the United
States of non-combatant Mexicans.
The reports do not explain their pres
ence.
Some officials believe, however,
economic and social conditions gen
erally in Mexico are such as to make
Mexicans of the wealthy class anxious
to get their women folks out of the
country for the present
The state department has not re
ceived, so far as known, any official
reports bearing out charges of Gen
eral Carranza's political enemies that
his grip is relaxing and that is pre
paring to leave Mexico.
VOTES FOR SOLDIERS.
St. Paul, Minn., Oct. 26.—Gov. J. A.
A. Buruquist today issued the call for
a special session of the state legisla
ture to assemble next Saturday for the
purpose of considering legislation that
would make it possible for the Minne
sota national guardsmen, now at the
Mexican border, to vote in the general
election November 7.
NORSE SHIP TAKEN
Vessel Carrying Mall is Reported
8elzed by Germans and Taken
Into Teuton Port.
Liondon, Oct/ 26.—It is now reported
that the Norwegian mail steamship
from Bergen for Newcastle which, ac
cording to advices received yesterday,
was stopped by a German warship, has
been taken to a German port, although
it had no cargo aboard.
The Norwegian mail steamships
form a conecting" link between Eng
land and the Scandinavian countries
and Russia. They carry many Ameri
cans and American mail, official and
otherwise. This is the first instance
in which the actual seizure of one of
them has been reported.
HOLD VERDUN GAINS.
Paris, Oct. 26.—The French troops
at Verdun are following up the advan

sweep on Tuesday and, according to
the latest information,-have closed in
to within less than 500 yards of Vaux
fort. Announcement of the capture Is
momentarily expected here, thus com
pletely restoring the French line held
on February 25.
The German forces at Verdun are re
acting with such apparent lack of
strength that, in the opinion of French
military men, they no longer possess
a general reserve.
Reports of casualties show French
losses were very light, considerably
less than the number of prisoners tak

The Germans had massed guns of all
calibers in the Ravine of Death, ail of

HUGHES ON LAST
Republican Nominee Plans
to Visit New England
and New York State-
New York, Oct. 26. —Charles E.
Hughes left New York this morning
on the last trip of his presidential cam
paign. His program called for three
speeches today at Hartford, Provi
dence and Boston.
Mr. Hughes' itinerary calls for four
days in New York state, exclusive of
Sunday, one Jay In Ohio and two days
in Indiana.
He will return to New York state
next Thursday. The last speech of
his campaign will be made at Madison
Square garden this city on the night of
Saturday, November 4.
Talks To Young America.
Hughes, in an address in Brooklyn
last night In which he made an appeal
to "the young voters of America," de
clared that the republican party had
"recovered from the division of four
years ago and is ready once more to
serve."
The republican party, Mr. Hughes
asserted, "sprang into being at a time
of the deepest national peril."
"Preserving the nation, it not only
abolished slavery but emancipated the
people from the curse of destructive
sectionalism," said the nominee.
After reciting at length what he
termed the achievements of the party,
Mr. Hughes asked: "What sort of a
country does young America, vibrant
with patriotism, desire?"
Saying he would endeavor to answer
the question, Mr. Hughes continued:
"He wants a country respected
throughout the world. He wants a
country which respects the dignity of
its citizenship and thus deserves and
enjoys the esteem of nations. He wants
no braggart assertion of power, no pol
icies of aggression, he has no desire
for strife.- But he desires to have the
American flag a symbol of firmness,
of a courageous and indomitable spirit,
of an Intense love of Justice, of great
strength well organized, but never mis
used, which secures protection to
American citizens in their Just rights
throughout the world. He must recog
nize that there is no permanent secur
ity for a people which takes counsel
of its fears rather than of its prin
ciples. Timidity, weakness and chang
ing purpose are feeble custodians
either of a nation's honor or of a na
tion's peace."
If we do not protect our trade, Mr.
Hughes declared, it will be constantly
menaced and shackled.
Must Safeguard Citizens.
"If the lives of our citizens are not
safeguarded," said Mr. Hughes, "there
will be a continued invitation to
slaughter by those whose contempt we
have evoked.

been "jobbed" against the state.
Attorney General Barker was asked
by the commission about the alleged

the "belief that several veniremen
qualified with remarkable rapidity and
knew more about the case than they
pretended to know."
