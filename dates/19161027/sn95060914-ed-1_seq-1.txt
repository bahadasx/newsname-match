LEAVE IS GRANTED
A C Peterson Has Consent
of School Board to Attend
Legislature
Principal A C Peterson has
full consent to leave -his post of
duty at the Academy e
Prof Horace Hi Cummings
general superintendent of Church
Schools is perfectly willing for
Mr Peterson tosjiave leave of
absence during his stay in the
legislature if elected and con
siders it the propftf thing for
teachers togefr advantages of
this character to broaden their
experience for future and furth
er advantages to the school
The executive board also ex
tends to Mr Peterson for such
time as hejnay needto fill a term
as representative mUhe coming
legislature -
Respectfully
Andrew Kimball
President Board of Education
We understand that some peo
ple are making tho statement
that A C Peterson should not
be elected as Staterepresenta
tive because the Academy heeds
his services and that the school
will be injured by his absence
They seem to believe that the
discipline of the scKoolfyill not
be maintained
This appears to be 3 -reflection
upon the able teachers in the in
stitution The faculty of the
Gila Academy is composed of
teachers of broad experience arid
high attainments in school woifr
so there is no ground dr uneasi
ness The school will be well
cared for Mr Peterson will
secure a competent person to take
charge of his class work
This school term will make
fourteen years - of continuous
faithful service in the Gila
Academy Dont you believe Mr
Peterson hasearnedjji short vaca
tions - a
The experience
BlAstetirwiuffleffif
I - - t V v v -
er and better teacher and pnn
cipal Modern educational
thought advances the idea that
teachers should take an active
part in our social affairs The
school and practical life should
not be divided It is the mission
of the teacher to preriare his
students for social service and
efficiency so the more experience
the teacher gets the better he is
prepared to do his work
Again if Mr Peterson is elect
ed it will give the school a recog
nition that will prove to be ben
eficial as it will become better
known throughout the State It
therefore appears that the Acad
emy will be benefited rather than
injured by his election
Put Out the
Fire Quickly
The home of Otto Lester on
Fourth West street caught on
fire Tuesday morningabout 1115
oclock and the fire department
responded in quick time making
the run in six minutes
When the firemen reached the
building the roof and inside of
the house was enveloped in
flames The firemen connected
the hose at the fire plug on
Briers corner and soon had a
good stream of water playing on
the fire besides a stream from
the chemical engine and the fire
was soon put out
Nearly all the roof was burned
and the interior suffered the
ravages of the flames Very
little of the furniture was saved
and the loss to house and furni
ture will be over 50000
The house and furniture was
insured at 70000
The fire was caused by a hot
iron setting fire to the cloth on
an ironing board in the screened
porch The flames soon reached
the curtains and side of the
porch and attacked the roof and
the dining room and kitchen

S AFFORD GRAHAM COUNTY ARIZONA OCTOBER 27 1916
GETtTHIS DOWN TOM
Another Statement of Tom
- Pamnholl le Nailol tn
Wc85Fr
the Cross
Tom Campbell certainly has
the figures down right in regard
to the institutions where he
would make reforms and reduce
expenses that is according to
his own peculiar methods of giv
ing out the political dope for the
people to swallow
While here he told of there be
ing more teachers than students
at the Flagstaff Normal also
made the assertion that there
were more instructors than stu
dents at the University of Ari
zona
In refutation of these glaring
misstatements we quote from a
telegram received from Leroy
ALadd secretary to Governor
Hunt
There are approximately sev
enteen students for every teacher
at the Flagstaff Normal and a
statement from the President of
the University says there are
fourteen students to a teacher
or thirty six instructors and ex
tension workers twenty six of
wnom are paid wholly from fed
eral funds
How about Campbells state
ment now The above figures
are easily verified and it is sur
prising that a man aspiring to
the high office of governor of the
State should make such untrue
statements and expect to get
avay with them
in speaking of these
tionSj Mr Campbell told of where
he would cut the expenses by re
ducing the number of teachers
and instructions He forgot to
mention that twenty six othe
thirty six instructors at the Uni
versity are paid wholly from
federal funds Get that It
does riot cost the people of Ari
zona one cent for their salaries
That 161000 did you get
that John I is dwindling down
We got it down alright and
also the measure of the man
which is gradually growing
smaller and smaller until it will
have sunkbehind the horizon of
votes for Hunt on November 7th
Get that down Tom

The democrats held a splendid
meeting last night at the Armory
The hall and gallery were filled
with people to greet the demo
cratic State candidates headed
by Senator Ashurst and Mrs
Brady ONeill candidate for

county who was here with a
special message to the women of
Graham county
A meeting was held at Thatch
er at the Amusement Hall which
was packed to the doors The

for Mine Inspector

Ihe Safford Band rendered
patriotic airs for the meeting
iJfJP1 1 he Thher
the Thatcher meeting --
airs craay UMNeill as the first
speaker here
Mrs ONeill was warmly ap
plauded as she acknowledged
the introduction 4
Mrs ONeill gave a graphic
description of the
Party and showed that that or
ganization was really working for
the election of the republican
candidate for president Chas E
Hughes and that womans suf
frage was a side jssue a cloak to
hide their real object in this
campaign
Mrs ONeill explained that it
was impossible for the president
to grant womans suffrage this
must be secured in the different
states Already twelve states
had granted equal rights to wom
en and it was necessary to se
cure twenty four more states to
carry the amendment
The womans party was not
fighting the republican candidate
for President in the republican
states opposed to womans suf
frage but was fighting president
Wilson who voted for womans
suffrage in the democratic states
which had granted equal rights
to women showing plainly that
the Womans Party was an ad
junct to the republican party - -
wrs u iseu told of an address
made at Willcox several weeks
ago by Henry D Estabrook a
repuuncan spellbinder who in
speaking on womans suffrage
said
That the women did not have
mind enough to vote intelligently
They had only two ideas war
and peace and until the letter
M was taken out of the word
Motherhood and the women of
this country agreed to raise their
boys for soldiers as far as he
was concerned he never would
grant their right for equal suf
frage
This republican speaker was a
true exponent of the real feeling
of the republicans for womans
suffrage
Mrs ONeill was frequently
interrupted by applause and
there was no doubt that the
women present had received her
message and understood the real
situation regarding the Womans
Party
John Bolin candidate for mine
inspector was the next speaker
and told of the good work of his
department Mr Bolin made a
good impression on the audience
David F Johnson candidate
for State treasurer followed Mr
Bolin and spoke of the duties of
his office and made an earnest
appeal for the election of Presi
dent Wilson and the democratic
State ticket
Senator Ashurst who had
spoken at the Thatcher meeting
