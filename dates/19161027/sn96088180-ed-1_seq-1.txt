tacked Secretary of War Baker.
"It I said that criticism of tbe ad

that the alternative of the policy of

a vote for wsr. What a preposterous
suggestion!
"A vole for me Is vote for lasting
peace, because It Is a vote for maln
tanlng the honor of the country, for
maintaining both self-reapect and
eteem of all nation of the earth.
"It Is fallacy to suppose we can
be kept out of war unless we have the
respect of all other nations. Unless
we Impress them with the firmness
of our national character, we shall
not be la a position to secure the
favorable peace we deilre.'
Hughes was In unusually high
spirits after last night's meeting In

Concerning Japan's Intentions to

like China for a permanent, friendly,
profitable and satisfied customer, and
with no political or selfish objects.
"No one can certainly foretell
whether there will be a continuance
of large business for a year or for
severnl years. Obviously, the wle
man will husband his resources, keep
within safe limits and avoid over
extension. "At the end of the war, foreign
countries now buying our products,
