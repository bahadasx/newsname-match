What New York Thinks of Mr. Hughes
In the New York State election in 1908, the
majority vote for
Mr. Taft, for President, was 202,602
that for
Mr. Hughes, for Governor, was only 69,462
WHAT MR. HUGHES THINKS OF HIMSELF
In 1912 when Justice Hughes was a mem
ber of the Supreme Court and was asked to be
come a candidate for President, he said:
"The man who on the highest judicial tribu
nal would consider another office is fit neither
for the one he holds nor for the one to which he
aspires.
V- WJd JUM(W--AXh-.a'OLOC3t'.'.:
At the iBBt meeting of the Retail
ers' association a committee com
posed of C. A. Brown, Bert Long and
W. E. Wilson was appointed to make
a canvass of the business men and
see what could be done In the matter
of a uniform closing hour. With the
exception of the drug stores, hard
ware stores and the jewelers practic
ally everyone signed the agreement.
This schedule will take effect Novem
ber 1 and remain in force until an
nounced later that a change has been
made.
BIB. DOERK HERE TOMORROW
; A. A. Doerr of Lamed, Democratic
candidate for state senator from this
district, will be in Liberal tomorrow
to meet the voters of Seward county.
It is not yet known whether he will
make a speech that night or not. If
lie does, the fact will be advertised
by hand bills. Mr. Doerr Is a suc-
ces3ful business man of his home
town and reports from up that way
indicate he will carry Pawnee county
solidly. He Is a man who is alive to
the needs of the Thirty-Eighth dis
trict, and If he makes a speech it will
e merely to outline his plans for
-effecting the same. Hunt him up
and talk to him tomorrow.
CALVERT'S A FINE FELLOW;
TOO BAD HE DRINKS!
The fact that Frank Hays makes
a nice, soft cushion Is all that kept
the bone piles of R. A. McPhee and
the editor from getting mixed in the
wild ride home from Liberal at 2
a. m. Wednesday morning. Ray Ed--wards
was driving his Reo six and
pulling off stunts like one sees in the
xnovleg while the three occupants of
the back seat expected every moment
to be thrown clear over Saint Peter
And his golden gate right into the
xnldst of the hallelujah angels. Even
the moon seemed to . be - out' ior ' a
lark as it danced Itself Into pieces
and circled round the heavens In
-corkscrew spirals while the waters of
the mud holes shot out in sparkling
rainbows and disappeared beyond
the horizon. Though Hays has a
stack of sore ribs, McPhee was scared
out of ten years' growth, Raymond
Jones converted, and the editor's
spine still resembles a letter S, yet
the ride was one of the most thrill
ing and enjoyable features of the
trip Plains Journal.
BUY THE CITY MEAT MARKET
Dr. J. S. Miller and R. Farrell
lave purchased the City Meat Market
And Mr. Farrell is now in charge of
the same. He and his family moved
liere from Missouri about a month
ago. They have an announcement in
our advertising columns this week
to which we call your attention. The
City Market is a good property and
-we hope it pans out a good business
venture for the new owners. Mr.
Cooper, the meat cutter, will con
tinue with the new management.
SMALL FIRE AT, GEORGE
y - GROCERY '.'
A small blaze sprang up in the to
bacco store room of the J. E. George
Grocery Co., Wednesday evening
about 9 o'clock, with the result that
between $25 and $50 worth of to
bacco was ruined. There was no one
in the store except Mr, George and
Tom Blakemore at the time It hap
pened, who were just ready to cIobb
the store and go home, when they
smelled smoke and decided to Investi
gate. The plastering got so hot in
the store room it came loose from the
wall and ceiling. No alarm was
turned In and the blaze was put out
In a short time with the damages
above noted.
A LIGHT RAIN
Nearly a quarter of an inch of rain
fell Sunday night in Liberal and vi
cinity. While this wasn't much, It
was greatly appreciated as the streets
were getting somewhat dusty and the
standing crops were also helped con
siderably. It was also a forerunner
of more rains to come later on.
MOOSE HAVE BIG WIND-UP
MEETING
The Moose lodge had a big "wind
up" meeting on Thursday night of
last week, at which 39 new members
were Initiated into the order. A
seven-act entertainment was furn
ished the members at the Majestic
theatre after the degree work had
been conferred, and the "big eats"
were" served after the show. This
winds up the membership contest
that has been in progress among the
Moose since the lodge was instituted,
and they now have nearly 200 mem
bers to show as a result, and the Roll
of Honor for new members was
closed. T. V. Symon, who secured
29 new members, won the first prize,
a magnificent watch charm. Harry
Stifel, who got 12 applications, won
second, a beautiful Moose head lapel
pin. The Moose lodge now has the
largest membership of any order in
Liberal, due to the persistent boost
ing and plugging of the members.
Much credit Is due Chas. Benj. Lopp,
the district manager, who organized
and instituted the new lodge, and
whose strenuous efforts for the or
der have borne such good results.
Emery Hill left yesterday for his
claim near Springfield, Colorado.
WILSON RUNNING STRONG
The Rexall Drug Company Is tak
ing a straw vote of the Presidential
race in all Its stores located in all
corners of the United States. The
local Rexall store, Chas. Taylor &
Co., opened their poll books Tuesday
morning and up to 10 o'clock yester
day 115 votes had been cast for Wil
son, against 22 for Hughes. These
results are wired In to Rexall head
quarters every night. If all the Rm
all stores make that gobd a showing
we have a fairly good Idea what will
happen over the nation on the first
Tuesday In November.
HUBBARD'S POULTRY GETS
PRIZES
Tris Hubbard's famous Buff and
Blue Orphlngton chickens scored
again. At the Dallas (Texas) state
fair they took seven first prizes out
of a possible ten, besides dragging
down numerous second and third
prizes for good measure. The poul
try judges at this fair were: Branch
of Missouri, Heimlich of Illinois, and
Savage of Texas. When we take into
consideration the fact that the Dal
las state fair is the second largest
one in the United States, the winning
of seven out of ten prizes Is quite a
showing for Liberal products.
TO ORGANIZE AUTOMOBILE CLUB
The Chamber of Commerce Is to
organize an automobile club In the
near future, which club shall have
for Its object the marking of all the
roads in the vicinity of Liberal. This
is an improvement which Is greatly
needed and will require but a small
expenditure of money. There are
several other improtant propositions
which can be worked out by this club
and it should be a big factor in the
development of this country.
MAJESTIC THEATRE SOLD
The Majestic Theatre, which has
been owned and operated by Chas.
W. Rogers, better known as "Sliv
ers," for the last year and a half, was
sold the last of the week to O. E.
Melsenhelmer. The Majestic hat
proven a profitable financial institu
tion to Mr. Rogers during the time
he has had it and has gained the
reputation of a mighty good picture
and vaudeville show- house under his
jurisdiction. It has shown to a
crowded house nearly every night
since he took hold of it, and the
movie fans of the town will regret
to see him relinquish its manage
ment. Mr. Melsenhelmer, the new
proprietor, is known to lots of Llber-

al people. He has for some time
been connected with the Borderland
Trail Garage, and Is a mighty pleas
ant fellow to get along with. Mr.
Rogers has been assisting him In
getting on to the ropes of the busi
ness since the deal was made and we
believe the new owner will do as well
as the old after he gets familiar
with the details of the business.
"Silvers" is thinking about leaving
Liberal and looking up a larger loca
tion after he hat taken, short va
catlonand.wo hoe Joe jjucneetls im
mensely wherever he locates.
TO REDUCE THE DUES
The dues for the Chamber of Com
merce will be reduced beginning the
next quarter, November 1. The new
schedule of dues will effect only the
A and B classes. The A class dues
will be reduced from $1.60 a month
to $1 per month and the B class from
$1 to 76 cents per month. The C
class will remain 60 cents per month.
The D claBs will continue $1 per year.
This will mean quite a difference In
the finances of the organization. It
will require more members to keep
the organization alive and doing
things. A great many have joined
the club of their own accord during
the quarter without being urged.
This shows that the membership can
be greatly Increased It everyone gets
busy in the Interest of the club. The
reaBon the board of directors reduced
the dues was bo the Chamber of Com
merce might become interested and
get the interest and cooperation of
a large number.

pleased at any cost to ourselves.

A Real Man
It is pretty hard to assert your inde
pendence and defy the world, when you
have an empty stomach and an empty
pocket book.
The prudent man who has saved a
little and has a reserve at the bank is not
so afraid of sickness nor a coward about
being out of a job. A bank account is a
stimulant to real manhood. Surplus is not
what is earned, but what is saved.
