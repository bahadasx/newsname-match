MEXICAN PLOT
SCARE BASED
ONJUMORS
Neither Secretary Baker nor
Secretary Lansing Can
Give Source.
"ABSURD TO THINK
IT'S POLITICS ONLY"
Administration Hastens to
Say They Have No Clue
Leading to Americans.
Washington, Oct. 27.—The war and
•tate department officials refused to
day to disclose the source or specific
nature of the Information on which
Se ore
tray Baker last night issued a
statement charging that a bandit at
tack on American troops in Mexico or
on the American border towns h?d
been planned to discredit President
Wilson's Mqvlcan policy.
They said the channel of informa
tion through which the report came
was so valuable that nothing would
be given out which might Injure Its
usefulness.
Both Baker and Lansing laid stress
today upon the statement that no con
sideration of domestic politics led to
the Issuance of the announcement
that such a plot had been discovered.
"The obviously appropriate oom
ment of the secretary of state, "said
Secretary Baker, referring to the ex
planation of Lansing last night that
no American was Implicated and that
the desire to prevent the carrying out
of the plans had prompted Baker's
statement, "precludes the possibility
that any such construction or under
standing could be put upon the state
ment. It is without political purpose
and ought to be Without political ef
fect. It will have served its purpose if
It serves a notice upon the lawless
people In Mexico that wo have been
warned and are prepared."
"Political? Absurd," Says Baker.
Baker said that it is "absurd" to
suppose that his statement had been
Intended to imply any political inter
est in the United States desired any
thing other than peace on the border.
"Such a thing could not be," he said.
"Mexicans opposing the do facto
government would be glad to compli
cate the relations between the two
countries and our information is that
they think this an appropriate time to
do so," Baker added.
In his statement last night Secre
tary Baker asserted:
'The war department has receiv
ed definite information, confirmed
from,* other sources, tfcat enemies cf
the'" administration's policy toward
Mexico, In co-operation with Villa 9r
other bandits in Mexico, had arrang

VILLA DRIVES ENEMY
BACK AT EVERY POINT
Oarmnsa Forces Sortie Worn City of
Chihuahua But Are In a Hurry
to Get Back.
B1 Paso, Oct. 27.—"With Villa in
the field as a military commander,
Carranza forces will be better able to
cope with him than when he oper
ated as a bandit with a small and
mobile force of men In a oountry he
knows perfectly," said Andres Gar
Ola, Inspector general of Carranza
consulates In the United States, to
day. "The commanders who are
coming from the south to campaign
against Villa are the ones who de
feated him so decisively at Celaya
and Leon and they have no fear of
Villa, whom they forced to run at
these engagements," added Garcia.
He .said he doubted the reliability of
General George Bell's news sources
In reference to the situation in Chi
huahua City and western Chihuahua.
Garcla's statement Is not borne out
by reports of the fighting about Chi
huahua, received as official reports by
the El Democrata, the official Car
ranza organ here, which would indi
cate that Villa has driven the Car
ranza forces back every time they
sortie from Chihuahua and that the
de facto forces refuse to stand for
an open battle.
The story of the engagement as
given In El Democrata, locates the
greater part of the fighting at Santa
Tsabel, 26 miles southwest of the
state capital. The vanguard of Gen
eral Ozlna's column left Chihuahua
City last Friday and proceeded to
Santa Ysabel, leaving a rear guard at
Palomas, 18 miles from Chihuahua
City. The main column did not leave
Chihuahua City until Saturday mor
ning. An attack was made by Villa
on the rear guard at Palomas at 4
o'clock Saturday morning. This rear
guard marohed to Santa Tsabel, the
account states, where It Joined the
vanguard. During the fighting at Pa
lomas,' Martin Lopes, one of Villa's
chiefs, was killed, the paper says. An
attack was made by the Villa forces
upon the vanguard at Santa Tsabel,
the bandits being In command of
Villa personally. The fight lasted
two hours and having received no re
inforcements from the main column
the Carranza commander returned to
Palomas as Villa was getting rein
forcements hourly.
At Palomas another group of band
its appeared and attacked the retreat,
tnff vanguard, which succeeded In
breaking through although pursued
by the Villa troops to Salas, 12 miles
from Chihuahua City.
In the meantime General Ozuna's
column had proceeded on military
trains to Fresno Saturday, where the
main column detrained, the trains be
ing sent back to Chihuahua City to
prevent their capture. The bandits
appeared again at Palomas and the
retiring vanguard then joined the
main column at Fresno, being pur
sued by the bandit force*
General Osuna then ordered the
forces to retire to Chuviscar, Just out
side of Chihuahua City In order to re
organise his column. He sent his
wounded Into the city and went there
Saturday evening for a conference
with General Trevlno after which he

Importance in enabling statesmen and
naval and military experts to Judge
of the value of a tunnel. He added

in a better position for transporting

general purposes of the war.

BIG DIVIDENDS.
New York, Oct. 27.—The New Jer

extra dividend of five per cent In ad

extra dividends thus far this year.
"I will see," added the premier,
"that time will bo found for a full re

This year it was announced that
France had taken all the necessary
steps to enter into negotiations with
England for the Joint construction of
a tunnel under the English channel.
Plans for the tunnel were outlined at
that time by M. fitartiaux, chief en
gineer of the Nord Railway company.
He said that the tunnel would cost
16,000,000 pounds and that If It was
apportioned equally between England
and France, two days' war time ex
penditure of both countries would
more than cover the cost of the tun
nel. Mr. Sartlaux said that it was
proposed to make two tunnels and
said that the possession of such a
tunnel at the outbreak of the war
would have been of great use both to
Franoe and England.
