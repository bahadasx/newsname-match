ADDRESS TO CHURCHMEN.
Congressman Dale at Hartford,
Conn., Makes Excellent Speech
Former Island Pond Boy
Gives Interesting Account of
Speech.
The following is from the Hartford j
Courant of Oct. 12, giving an ac
count of Congressman Dale's ad
dress to the Interchurch Men atHart
ford, Conn.:
The conclusion reached by the
joint commission of Americans and
Mexicans after living six weeks in
luxury at the expense of the United
States government providing for
the protection of American citizens
in Mexico by Carranza on condition
that the American troops are re
movedwas criticised by Congress
man Porter H. Dale of Vermont
Wednesday noon, Oct. 12, while ad
dressing the Interchurch Men at the
Allyn House. He pointed out that
the international law required Car
ranza to protect the Americans in
Mexico and that the President need
ed no such agreement by the joint
commission to compel the observan
ces of ordinary international law.
"America is literally the greatest
nation of the world today, said the
congressman. "After the war,
financial discussions will be removed
from London to New York. Then
there will be remorseful jealousy of
America. The countries across the
water will ask, "Is it possible that
that new government' over there
the country we said could not suc
ceed and whose dreams could not be
realized is it possible that that
country is now the greatest in the
world and that we must bow to it
now?"
"Such a situation will have to be
met alter the war, said the con
gressman," "and we've got to meet
it as the United States against the
world. We have not indicated in
the present administrarion our abili
ty to meet such a situation. The
results to the south of us have been
simply beyond discussion. The policy
of President Wilson has been one of
personal animosity, which has shown
us that he failed to grasp the great
purpose. Our American citizens
have not been protected in Mexico."
The speaker said that it seemed
to him that the purpose of the Pres
ident was merely to oust Huerta.
He was not criticised so much for
refusing to recognize Huerta, but
his foreign policy sfemed rather
peculiar in that he forced Huerta to
abdicate whed Huerta had been rec
ognized by the other great countries
of the world. Huerta had to go.
He came to the United States, and a
short time later, died. Wilson then
recognized Carranza and the Colum
bus raid followed. When Carranza
demanded that the Americae troops
be withdrawn from Mexico, Wilson
sent a message in which he indicated
that if any hostility followed that
threat," the severest consequences
would be visited upon Carranza
Then American cavalry was attacked
in Mexico, a number of cavalrymen
were.killea ana many taken prison
ers.
President Wilson notified Carranza
that he considered that a hostile act
He demanded the return of the
American bodies and Carranza told
him the United States would have
to come and get them if it wanted
them. Virtually, Carranza told the
United States, "I shall do precisely
as I please."
"We hope to elect a better diplc
mat next month, a. man who can en
force international law," added the
congressman.
Regarding the statement of demo
crats that the f resident kept us
out of war," the speaker said that
Wilson had not kept the United
States out of war in Mexico and that
it would have been absolutely im
possible for him to get us into war
with Germany or any of the other
belligerent powers, because those
countries knew that their very hope
of victory depended on keeping

Automobile Overturned Over
Bank Near JSt. Johnsbury and
Mr. and Mrs. 12. Morse Were
Killed.
Mr. and Mrs. Edmund C. Morse
of Lyndon were instantly killed early
Sunday evening when their touring
car went through a fence and over
turned at the foot of the embank
ment near the Maplewood farm
about four miles north of St. Johns
bury. Mr. Morse, a merchant, was
53 years of age and his wife was 44.
With Mr. and Mrs. Morse were
Miss Amelia Lee.Miss Maud Wether-
bee and Miss Alice Brncroft, all
teachers in the public schools of
Lyndon. Thoy were returning from
a trip to Calais, the home of Miss
Bancroft, and were within three
miles of Lyndon when they struck a
narrow strip of road. There they
met another car, and Mr. Morse,
evidently dazed by the bright glare
of the lights, swerved too much to
one side and lost control of the car
when it left the road. The machine
dashed through the fence and turned
turtle, pinning all beneath. The
three young women were in the back
seat and managed to get out with
out assistance, but Mr. and Mrs.
Morse were caught by the steering
wheel and the back of the front seat
and were crushed so badly that they
died instantly. The road is much
traveled and motorists quickly gath
ered and helped lift the car from the
victims.
Miss Wetherbee suffered slight
concussions and had to be attended
by a physician. Miss cancrott was
somewhat bruised about one hip
Mis? I ee escaped unhurt.
Mr. Morse was a native of Cabot
and had been in business at Lyndon
for 15 years, previously having been
postmaster. His wife was a native
of Concord. They leave one son,
Leslie, 14 years old. Mr. Morse is
survived by five brothers and two
sisters, of whom W. E. Morse, a
jewe'.er.and Mrs. Alice Robinson live
in Burlington. Mrs. Morse leaves
an aged mother, a brother and three
sisters.
