TWO MEN FOUND DEAD,
: Bosworth Business Men in Boat
Hunting on the Missouri.
No Autopsy Held.
Saturday morning while a boy
who fishes and hunts moot of the
, time on the Missouri river oppo
site Brunswick was puddling
about his business, he observed a
small launch resting prow first
on a sand bar near the southern
shore. He went to the launch
. and discovered two men therein,
both dead, one lying over the
gasoline engine and the other
stretched lengthwise in one end
ot the boat He gave the alarm
and the coroner of Carroll county
took charge of the matter.
: The dead men were Al Snoop,
formerly of Rothviile, but en
gaged, at the time of his death,
in the hardware business in bos
worth, and the other a druggist
of Bosworth named Grissom.
Thurbday before being found
these men were in Brunswick,
and after laying in a few sup
plies they pulled out for the
river, to resume their hunt it is
presumed. There was another
merchant of Bosworth who in
tended to join Snoop and Gris
som, but after coming to the
liver in his car, he abandoned
the hunt and went back.
When found the two men ap
peared to have been dead some
time, though the watch worn by
Grissom was still running and
showing about the correct time.
He wore several diamonds and
other jewelry and had about $90
in Ms pockets, and nothing was
missing on either man.
The theory of suicide part is
held by many, others believing
that Grissom desired to commit
.suicide and after taking poison
gave whatever contained poison
to Shoop. There was no bottle
or box or any receptacle which
indicated liquor or poison had
been used to be found by the
searcher, and in the absence of
an autopsy, no satisfactory ex
planation of the cause for the
deaths is known. It is rumored
that the bodies will be disin
terred and an autopsy held the
only thing to do to satisfy.

Friday afternoon October 6 the
young men and young women
composing the basket ball team
S. H. S. were here and piatd
our teams. No bWeeiergirla nor
moie gallant young men in the
county, but as wun ail attract
ions, circus loiluwer with un
tavor reputations and unscrupu
lous wys for providing mui
seives wun lunds un whicn to
fpiurge around among descent
people, there were some young
men irom our sister ciiy on ihe
eas loiloweu tne pu.ycr and
who have branded mem tlves o
their acts here and it will rtquire
some years of correct living to
wear away the marks.
After the ball giu.es some ol
the Salisbury "ooys" came lo
the hardware sioie oi W. I).
Vaughan and asked to be anoweu
tu use the telephone. Permission
was cheerfully granted by Mr.
Vaughan. Tne pnoue is m a
irom corner of tn store room
auu next the cutlery case While
one young man waa pnowng
another was helping himseit to
the best pocket anivea in the
Case. Just wmcn one stalled and
which ransacaed tne show case
is not known for sure, but when
a man who delivered a barrel of
cider to Salisbury and had trou
ble in getting tne bung out and
was offered the use of a gold
handled knife on which the
name W. D. Vaughan was print
ed, returned and asked Mr.
Vaughan if he had boid Sal
isbury people pocket Knives. Mr
Vaughan in vestigated and found
that all bis gold and pearl hand
led knives were gone, tho he
said nothing, he begun to saw
wood. Getting on the trail of
Victor Watson, Louis "Red"
Hale and Polly Pyle was easy
and following it easier for they
had bartered their stolen knives
in many places.
Constable Hen Davis was put
to work sleuthing and to date
he has returned tnirteen of the
fine knivesto their lawful owner,
besides apprehending and arrest
ing the young fellows named,
each of whom plead guilty and
was fined in a Salisbury Court.
Mr. Vaughan has been check
ing up to ascertain the number
of knives taken and when he
learns the exact loss, he expects
the proper parties to make good
to him.
There was another young man
whose name it was undertaken
toconnet with the robbery by
some engaged in it but that he
had nothing whatever to do
with the nefarious business, not
person who knows him or is
acquainted with his reputation
will believe for a moment Con
necting that young mans name
with the transaction was as con
temptible as the swiDinor the
knives was good evidence of dis
honesty.
