Important Expedition, Guided and Ac
companied by Local Residents
Blazing New Trail.
Last Wednesday morning at an ear
ly hour, a party of distinguished gen
tlemen, including Douglas White, gen
eral industrial agent of the Salt Lake
Route, State Engineer W. D. Beers,
C. H. Kendall, senior highway com
missioner of the National Forest Dis
trict No. 4, and E. H. Bingham, pho
tographer, arrived in Cedar City at
an early hour from Lund, and at once
prepared to mount horses for a trip
into the mountains and canyons east
and southeast of Cedar City, of sev
eral days duration.
Notice of their coming had already
been received and all arrangements
made for the expedition, which was
preceded into the mountains by a six
horse camp train, in chnrge of Julius
Rosenberg and Roy Uric.
The services of R. A. Thorley of this
city were obtained to guide the expe
dition, ar. I the party was joined here
also by County Commissioner H. W.
Lunt and County Road Commissioner
H. C. Jenson.
Trail to Brink of Little Zion Canyon.
The chief object of the expedition is
to look out b suitable automobile road
to the brink of the Little Zion Canyon
; in Washington county, which it is be
lieved can best be seen from the top
of the cliff. It is designed to make
this one of the important side trips for
tourists passing over the Arrowhead
Trail from Salt Lake City to Los
Angeles, and another object sought by
the building of the projected route is
to include in the trip as much as pos
Bible of the splendid scenery of the
mountains and canyons along the in
tervening region, which in many re
spects is more fascinating than the
wonders of Little Zion itself.
Will Combine Forces on Project.
By the combining of Federal, State,
County, and private aid, it is believed
that a satisfactory route for automo
biles can be constructed next year.
Of course, the route will be more
than a mere automobile road for pleas
ure seekers. It will penetrate to the
timber and coal supplies, and will al
so nodoubt form a link in an inter
county road between this and Garfield
or Kane counties. Particularly will
this be the case if the route selected
chances to be through Coal Creek can
yon, which seems probable.
This is a matter of very great im
portance to this section of the coun
try and should receive the support and
assistance of all loyal and progress
ive citizens.
The Salt I,ake Route is especially
to be commended for the keen inter
est it displays in any matter calculated
to benefit and advance the interests of
any of the country tributary to its
lines. There is nothing small or nar
row about this organization, and our
only regret is that they cannot see
their way clear as yet to build a spur
into this part of the country; hut this
will come in due time, and at the rate
we are developing, it will not be much
longer delayed.

LOAFING HABIT IS
TABOOED BY PARENTS
West Ward Sunday School Class Fa
vors Drastic Measures to Keep
Idle Men Off Streets.
For the past two Sundays the Par
ents' class of the Cedar West Ward
Sunday School has had under consid
eration the "Loafing Habit" and the
best means of ridding the town of this
evil.
Km- many years this problem has
confronted us, but up to the present
time nothing has been said or done
that has proven effectual. The streets
are still barred and the stores and
public places filled with indolent and
idle men.
Cur town was recently scored by
the state clean town inspector, and as
loafing was one phase of the matter
to be given consideration its preva
lence here could not fail to have It
effect upon our standing in the state
contest.
In casting about for some practical
method of reducing this evil, each
member of the class last Sunday was
requested to contribute his opinion,
among which were the following:
1st. That the city buy machinery
and prepare to furnish employment
for men who desire work, thereby im
proving our streets and public high
ways. 2nd. Allowing men to take full
charge of household duties and assume
the care of children while the women
bask in the warm sunshine and ex
change a few idens.
lird. Religious pressure.
4th. That the older men of the com
munity set an example and not use the
public thorofares for pastime.
6th. There are two kinds of loafing,
one habitual time-killing and the oth
er the legitimate mingling of men one
with another in the transaction of
business, which for the want of some
suitable quarters, is of necessity per
formed on the streets. Any town of
the size of Cedar City should have a
club, forum or other accommodations
where men could meet and discuss is
sues of the day or transact business
without blockading the streets, side
walks or other public places.
th. That the city ordinance be en
forced against vagrancy or loafing,
and that the violators be sentenced to
imprisonment at hard labor.
The mayor was requested to sec
that the city marshal be a live wire
in this matter.
The class solicits the hearty co-operation
of all city parents to aid in its
effort to eliminate this disgraceful
practice from the community.
A committee was selected by the
duel n publicity to get this matter
properly before the residents of the
c (immunity through the medium of the
newspaper.
RELIEF SOCIETIES
DO GOOD WORK
Not long since the two Relief So
cieties of Cedar City purchased the
old District School bouse and for the
past few weeks have been holding
their meetings in one of the rooms,
which has been made very attractive,
but they found themselves without
seats, except as they carried benches
from other public buildings.
In their meeting last Tuesday it
was suggested by one of the ladies
that every member furnish a chair,
and that to be one from home, as the
Society needs all the spare money the
members have to help finish paying
for the building, and with a little
paint the old chairs can be made to
look like new.
The doors of the Relief Society
building will be open Monday evening
between the hours of 7 and 8, when
all the members will be expected to
take their chairs there.
Everybody should take a little time
to step into the Library and look at
the beautiful show case the Relief So
cieties of the two wards have placed
there, and see some of the interesting
relics that have been collected. YVhy
can't the men of Cedar City be as
public spirited as the women are? An
exhibition of some of our farm prod-!
I ucts and mineral specimens would be I
I a very appropriate exhibit in a neat j
showcase in another quarter of the
library.
James Younger brought in a splen-1
did specimen ear of dry land corn th"
first of this week, raised wthout ir- ;
rigatinn on the entry of Henry Wick '
em, six miles southwest from Iron1
Springs ranch. The corn was planted
last spring fa 10 acre patch) and had
no further attention whatever until
it was ready for harvesting. The
yield was 25 bushels to the acre. We
have this specimen ear in our front
window, where it may be seen by any
one interested.
FATAL ACCIDENT
WITH DERRICK PORK
Will Trie of Hamilton's Fort
Meets Tragic Death While
Unloading Hay.
TINE OF HUGH FORK
PIERCES RIGHT LUNG
Death in Less Than 30 Hours After
Accident Funeral Saturday at
2 O'clock. P. M.
One of the most harrowing and
regrettable accidents that have hap
pened in thia locality occurred last
Wednesday morning at an early hour
to Will Crit of Hamilton's Fort, and
which resulted in bis death a little less
than thirty hours after. The young
man was unloading hay with a Jack
son derrick fork, having risen early
for the purpose, and in pulling the
fork back out of the barn, it got to
whirling as it descended and he was
unable to avoid it. One tine struck
him in the breast and penetrated his
right lung to a distance of six or eight
inches. Dr. Leonard eras nt once
called and covered the distance of six
miles to Hamilton's as , i !,!,- as pos
sible, but found the unfortunate young
man in a very precarious condition,
He had bled profusely internally and
his lung was filled with blood. He was
weak and alines! pulseless, He was
rushed to the Southern Utah Hospital
and evcrythiii pt .-;.! til :ie for him,
but his Wound proved fatal and he
passed away at 10:30 Thursday.
The funeral services will be held in
the Cedar city tabernacle tomorrow
afternoon at 2 odock, and interment
will be made in the Cedar City cemetery.
William Urie was the son of John
and Priscilla Line of Hamilton's Fort,
the aged father being in his 82nd
year. That at this advanced age he
should be required to witness the bur
ial of one of his strong, robust sons
seems to be an example of the irony
of fate.
Deceased was 28 years of age, be
ing born in Cedar City Sept. 10, 1888.
It is rumored t hut he was to have been
married in n month or so to one of
Cedar City's attractive young women.
Will returned only about two years
ago from a mision in Kentucky, neinc
obliged to return a couple of month
before the usual time on account of
ill health. He was a sincere and up-1
right young man of industrious habits
and good character.
The Record sympathizes with the
bereaved family in their affliction.
Dr. Leonard and Cashier Foster
left for Harmony at four oclock this
morning by auto to be piloted into
the hills by Prank Kelsey of that place
who has seven head of fine male
deer securely tied up awaiting them.
It is really too band to kill the poor
little creatures under those harrowing
conditions, but vou see they "need the
meat."

CHALMERS TOURING
IS ECONOMICAL
C. E. Raker of Y. Y. Motors a Solid
Year With Family, Covering
More than 12,000 Miles.
Cross-country touring in a well
built motor car is cheaper than paying
rent, according to cinrence F. Baker,
veteran motorist of New York City!
who Is just rounding out a solid year
of life on the open road.
Last December Mr. Baker purchased
' Chalmers Six-thirty in New York,
and ai companied by his wife and child,
Started fur Arizona, New Mexico and
the southwest. Traveling leisurely,
the party toured Yhrough twenty
states, crossing and recrossing moun
tain ranges of the west. The summer
was spent in Colorado with side trips
into Idaho. Wyoming, Utah and Ne
vada. When the car rolled into the
Chalmers factory grounds at Detroit
recently, the speedometer read in ex
j cess of 12.000 miles.
I "My actual upkeep expenses not in
cluding gasoline and oil stood me
$37.50 for the season's work," said
Mr. Raker, "Two thirds of my sum
; mer mileatrs was made over the steep
grades of the Rocky Mountains. A ;
I a mountain climber I can heartily rec
ommend the Chalmers Six-thirty. On
one occasion we carried nine nien up
a 22 per cent grade with no visible
lnbor on the part of the high speed
motor.
"The car's extreme flexibility was
the source of considerable comment
among my western friends. On our
trip east the carbureter worked per
fectly without a single adjustment,
although we passed through manv
chances of climate and altitude. I
consider my season's average of 17
miles to the gallon of gasoline, the
best record for economy I have ever
obtained."
On their long tour, the Raker familv
carried a complete camping outfit anil
patronized but few hotels.
J. David Leiirh of Lund, Utah, is
the distributor in Iron county of the
Chalmers cars. Adv.
