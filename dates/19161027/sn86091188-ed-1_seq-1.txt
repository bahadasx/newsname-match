WHY SHOULD I VOTE
FOR THE ROADS BONDS?
]„ a very few days the voters or
Lemhi county will ask this question,
Here is an analysis of t lie proposition
which will assist the voter and tax
payer in deciding how tie shall cast
fits ballot on this important question
which comes up at the general elec
tion November 7th.
The proposition before tire voter
Is whether or not Lemhi county is
empowered to issue bonds to the
amount of *150,000 for the purpose of
cooperation with the state highway
department aod the federal govern
ment in tlie construction of state
tilg liways in this county. There are
2 main highways under consideration
which have already beeu designate
ec j a prinoiymi route in the state of
j Idaho and designated as tlie Hoise
j Butte highway and the Lemhi state
highway fiy tire Commission. The
j former is to extend from tlie Mont
ana state line, where connection is
| had with the Park-to-Paik highway
j near the Houtce of tlie North Fork of
; Salmon, about fifteen miles north
0 f Gibbonsvilla, via Salmon, Challls,
Stanley Basin and Sawtooth national i
park, and over the Galena summit]
to Boise, Lemhi s portion extending j
] to the mouth ot tlie Palislmaroi river, !
] wliete the latter Is to extend from j
! Salmon southerly along the Lemhi j
' valley to the south boundary of the |
county via Leadore and Gilmore and
ultimately on to Idaho Fall».

be dona by contract and up to a cer
tain standard of construction which
insures the minimum expense of
tuainlenane. When completed the
roads are maintained by the state
and the entire state pays the ex
pense, thereby reducing the expend
itures by the counties.
The question the taxpayer will ask
is wlmt effect will this have upon
our taxes. In answer to tills most
important question we case to say
that tiie effect will be a reduction In
taxes and no increase over the pres
ent levies for several years to come.
Lemhi county will colled from tiie
taxpayers for tlie year 1916 the sum
of *18,4do for road purposes, the as
sessed valuation being approximately
*5,255,000 and tiie levy three-and-a
half mills. In addition to this we re
ceived *3,024 from the forest service
and *2,220 from automobile licenses
tills year, which will make the t' tal
sum available for roads in 1917 not
less than * 23 , 600 .
Now suppose that we eliminate the
cost of maintenance on these two
roads and estimate that the lands
will sell for 5 per cent and that we
will have to begin paying them In
ten years and pay tiieni after at the
rate of ten per cent of the prinlcpul
per year. Me would have to pay out
a total of *265,500 in twenty year».!
Since we would have to pay $7,600 1

could invest the part set a*He tor
