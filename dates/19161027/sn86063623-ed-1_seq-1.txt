MAJOR'S ADDRESS
WELL RECEIVED
Tells People of Lexington That
"Slush Fund" of Repub
licans Won't Work.
Sam C. Major, of Fayette,
Mo., who was heard in this city
last summer previous to the
August primary in his own in
terest, for the nomination to
succeed Mr. Hamlin, was the
speaker Wednesday night in the
interest of the Democratic tick
et. Mr. Major, after his defeat
was assured,, forgot that fight
and immediately volunteered his
services in behalf of the nomin
ees. He is now touring the dis
trict and has speaking dates up
to the day of the election.
In his address Wednesday, he
gave some little time to the bi
ennial charges of Republican
campaign orators that the school
fund of the state had been loot
ed. He gave facts and figures
of this "looting,"' and proved
that the one time this fund had
been looted was when the Re
publican., party was in power in
Missouri. (Some of the very
old citizens may remember
when.) . He said that the jurist
Lamm was an entirely different
person from the candidate
Lamm ; that Lamm knew as well
as everyone must, know, if they
seek the truth, that not one
cent had been diverted from the
school fund under a Democratic
administration. The aftermath
of the civil war when everything
was under Republican guidance,
money; was diverted from school
fund that has never been paid.
. Mr. Major paid a fine tribute
v. to the ability of Senator. Reed
4 and contrasted his accomplish
ments with that of millionaire
Dickey, who would supplant Mr.
Reed fn" the United States Sen
ate. "Mr. Dickey," he said, "had
only one thing to recommend
him, and that is MONEY."
He concluded his speech with
an appeal to all citizens to be
vigilant to the last moment and
i suffer not the great slush fund
of the opposition to defeat the
program of the Democratic
party PEACE, PROSPERITY
AND PREPAREDNESS.
Born a British subject, Walter
S. Dickey may still be loyal to
Great Britain; but he isn't
bragging about it in the Ger
man districts of Missouri.

REVIEWS THE RECORD.
Congressman Hamlin Deals Only
In Facts. In Presenting the
Cause of Democracy.
Congresman Hamlin spoke to
a crowded house Saturday night
and did more to enlighten the
voters in the way 'they should
vote than any other speaker thu3
far during the campaign. Mr.
Hamlin dealt in no abuse of the
opposition, nor did he wander
into unknown fields of political
expediency. He didn't have , to.
The record of the Wilson admin
istration was his theme and in a
plain straightforward manner
presented the facts of more
beneficial legislation that has
been put upon the statute books
during the past three and a half
years than during the fifty years
previous by a Republican ad
ministration. However, Mr.
Hughes says:
"The whole legislative accom
plishment must be wiped off the
books for the good of the coun
try." Mr. Hamlin challenged the
Republican speakers to be specif
ic and tell the voters whether
or not they are of the same mind
as Mr. Hughes. Whether they
would repeal the Child Labor
Law, the Income Tax Law, the
Eight Hour Law, the Reserve
Bank Law, the Farm Loan and
Bank Law, etc. He doubted
their sincereity and so do we,
and so do you.

Resolutions Passed by the Pres
byterian Crurch on the Res
ignation of Rev. S. O. Hall.
Whereas, our castor, the Rev.
S. O. Hall, has earnestly re
quested this congregation to
join him in petitioning Lafayette
Presbytery to dissolve the exist
ing relation of Pastor and Con
gregation, this conerrecation
hereby desires to express its ap
preciation of the faithful con
scientious labor of our pastor in
our midst, ever zealous for the
extention of God's Kingdom;
it was his joy and pleasure dur
ing the four years of his pastor
ate here to witness the beerini
nings and growth of three new
Mission babbath Schools; the
erection of South Side Chapel, as
well as the receiving by letter
and profession of faith of eighty
new members into the Church.
His true Christian sDirit mani
festing itself at all times and un
der all circumstances has en
deared him to all who camp, in
personal contact with him; his
stand in favor of all temperance
movements, his firm attitude in
advocating the sanctity of the
Sabbath, his dilicrent observance
of all the means of Grace, has
been an inspiration to the con
gregation and the subject of
favorable comment bv the mem
bers of our sister churches.
Throughout our little citv are
many humble homes not direct
ly connected with our Church
where the news of Mr. Hall's
departure will be received with
sincere regret, for with ever
ready sympathy he entered be
reaved homes bringing to the
heavy hearted and sorrowing
the comforts of God's Holy
word.
In financial matters Mr. Hall
has been the faithful heltw nf
our officers bringing the duty
ana privilege of giving fre
quently to the hearts and con
sciences of his people from the
pulpit; a debt of long standing
has been lifted ; the church edi
fice beautified by extensive im
provements and various benevo
lences liberally subscribed to
during his pastorate.
I he congregation also desires
to acknowledge with sincere ap
preciation the assistance, en
couragement and support ren
dered JUr. llall by his wife who
was indefatigable in her efforts
of doing good among the people,
visiting the sick and noor. nrcan-
izing a Bible Study Class among
our young women and in many
other channels sending out the
sweet influence of a true Chris
tian woman consecrated to the
work.
Therefore, be it resolved bv
this cogregation at a regularly
called congregational meeting,
that we shall remember Mr.
Hall's dilicrent and faithful ser
vice during his pastorate here
and commend him and his fam
ily to the loving care of our
Heavenly Father. -Draviner God's
blessing upon them in their
new Held of labor.
To each of them we say, may :
"The Lord preserve thv coiner
out and thy coming in from this
time torth, ana even forever
more.
