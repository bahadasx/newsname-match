One of the biggest employers of labor
In Ohio, Mr. Willys had this to say about
the labor vote:
The labor agitation has been very
active. There are well paid agitators at
work everywhere, supplemented by union
.guilts, making a Hrong but Ineffectual
right. Hut I do not find that any con
siderable number of workers who pre
viously voted the Itepubllcan ticket are
going lo voto for Wilson. The drift,
once threatening, is now becoming
negligible. Tho higher class of work-
Ingtiien will vote the Itepubllcan ticket
and so will the farmers. A Hughes sweep
of Ohio Is as Inevitable ns Christmas.
