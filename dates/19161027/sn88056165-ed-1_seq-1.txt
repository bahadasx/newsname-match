HE SKINNED
'EM ALIVE
Senator Rockwell Tried Old
Time Rip-Roaring Methods
But Did Not Win Many
Votes.
What promised for a time to
be one of the old-time blood and
thuuder, fire eating campaign
speeches was advertised here
Wednesday when bills were
scattered about the town an
nouncing the coming that eve
ning of Senator Rockwell, of
Blaine county, with the promise
that he would "skin Gov. Alex
ander alive!" This flaming an
nouncement drew out quite a
crowd to the opera house to see
how the "skinning" would be
done but after the citizens had
listened for nearly two hours to
the senator's attacks on the
governor most of them went
home firmer than ever of the
opinion that it will be to the best
interests of the state to return
the governor for another two
years on November 7th.
S. A. Anderson of Grangeville,
chairman of the republican
county organization, presided at
the meeting and the first speaker
was a south Idaholman who de
voted his time to the German
voters and why they ought to
support Candidate Hughes. He
closed with a final dig at Gover
nor Alexander which did not
lend strength to his former
pleadings.
• Senator Rockwell devoted his
time entirely to state matters
and particularly to pulling to
pieces the claimsîofjthejgovernor
in his recentfspeeches around the
state. He said there was no
such thing as a lie; it being
merely an "absence of the
truth," and to the casual ob
server this would seem to apply
to the senator's remarks fully as
well as he applied it to the chief
executive of the state. Senator
Rockwell claimed to be an expert
accountant and to have recently
gone through the books at the
state capita}. He also appears to
be a close student of psychology,
for he never failed to seize upon
the psychological place'to stop in
his remarks when to have gone
farther would0iave [meant un
doing all he had said. In claim
ing that the governor had af
fected no savings for the state
while in office he^stated that
there was $800,000 in the treas
ury from taxes collected during
the Haines administration when
Governor Alexander went into
office. He said the governor
caused $400,000 of this to be used
for state purposes and that this
could not properly be called a
saving of that amount. But he
failed entirely to state that at
the end of the present year there
will be considerably more than a
million dollars in the state treas
ury, as the governor stated here
last week, or more than enough
to run all the offices of the state
for the next year. He spoke of
the increased earnings of many
departments of state during the
past two years and said this was
due to efficiency of the state
officers and not to the governor,
but he failed again to say that
these offices had made a better
showing under the watchful eye
of-the governor than ever before.
Senator Rockwell told of the
Allen-Coleman defalcations and
tried to cast blame on the gover
nor for holding back on the settle
ment with the bonding company,
speaking feelingly of how the
bonding company was "knocking
on the door and asking for a
settlement," but forgot again to
tell the public that had this set
a
ia
so
ly
of
a
tlement been made when the
"knocking" was most insistent
the state would have secured only
$93,000 instead of $154,000, which
latter sum the governor finally
secured by holding back until
they could get to the bottom of
the matter.
In fact it looked very much
like a personal attack on the gov
ernor as the dying effort of the
old gang to ride back into office,
and judging from the icy silence
in which the remarks of the
speaker were received, the nota
ble lack of applause and en
thusiasm and the steadily dwind
ling audience, we doubt very
much if any votes were changed
as a result of the meeting.
New Elevator in Operation
The new 50,000 bushel elevator
of the Cottonwood Milling & Ele
vator company has been opera
ting for the past three or four
days and is working nicely. All
of the machinery except the dust
collectors, which will be shipped
with the new machinery for the
the flour mill, is in place and the
elevator i8 working without a
hitch except for an occasional
loose belt. More than ten thous
and bushels of grain has been
received and stored in the eleva
tor this weekend at the present
rate it will not take long to fill it
to full capacity.
Work on the'new mill building
is also progressing nicely and the
same will soon be under roof.
The mill building extends around
the elevator on two sides and is
arranged that grain can be
taken from any bin into the mill
without handling any of it by
hand. When completed the mill
and elevator will be one of the
mos» complete and labor-saving
plants in the state.
Manager Meyer states the
grain market is very strong at
this time and prices are going
higher almost daily. One farm
er refused a price of $1.50 per
bushel this week for Marquis
wheat.
Tannahill Made Good Speech
The political meeting held here
Saturday evening by Atty. Geo.
W. Tannahill, of Lewiston, drew
a fair crowd and was greatly ap
preciated by most of those who
heard him. Mr. Tannahill is a
pleasing speaker and treated his
subjects convincingly. He spoke
entirely on national matters and
reviewed the European war situ
ation as affecting this govern
ment, showing how President
Wilson had stood for peace at all
times and had refused to allow
the nation to be pushed into war
after the sinking of the Lusitan
ia and Sussex until the German
government had been given a
chance to explain those matters
satisfactorily. He said that the
Germans of this country had ev
ery reason to feel friendly to the
mother country and that this did
not destroy their good citizenship
so long as they were loyal to the
Stars and Stripes, and said
that had not Wilson occupied the
chair at the White House not on
ly war munitions but the young
men of our country would have
been going across the ocean
months ago to assist the allied
armies. He explained the Mex
ican situation as having been
brought on by tne weal hy man
of this country in order to have
the government protect their
enormous investments in that
country.
Mr. Tannahill spoke at some
length on beneficial legislation
enacted during the Wilson ad
ministratian and said it would be
a step backwaad not to allow the
president to continue his great
work. His speech throughout
was a sound, sensible talk to the
voter and it is to be regretted
that more of our people were not
there to hear him.

In The Political Arena
Not for years have the citizens
of Idaho county been given the
opportunity of supporting such
competent men for the legislative
positions as is given them this
year on the democratic ticket.
N. B. Petti bone, for senator, ha*
served the county loyally for
several years as county commis
sioner and can accomplish fine
results at Boise. He has made a
success of his own business as
farmer and business man and
understands the needs of the
county perhaps better than any
other man.
W. B. Hussman and John
Quinlan are both wide awake
young business men who are
closely identified with the up
building and development of the
county and realize its needs.
They are quite successful in their
own lines of business and will be
able to accomplish results if sent
to Boise.
E. M. Griffith, for prosecuting
attorney, and LaFayette R.
Yates, for sheriff, wili make a
team that will be hard to beat at
keeping the county orderly and
enforcing the law. Mr. Griffith
made an enviable record as coun
ty attorney several years ago and
at that time secured more con
victions than perhaps any other
man who has filled the office.
The record of Sheriff Yates dur
ing the past two years speaks
for itself. A vote for Griffith
and Yates is a vote for peace
and order in the county.
J. A. Bradbury, for county
treasurer, is the most competent
office man in the county, without
exception. He has filled the
office of county auditor here and
in Washington for several
terms and knows the work in the
the court house from top to
bottom. He will be able to run
the treasurer's office with fewer
clerks, less expense to the coun
ty and in a more capable manner
than it has been run for years.
If you beiieve in effiiciency in
public affairs as well as in private
life, you will support Bradbury
on Nov. 7th.
T. M. Atwood, candidate for
assessor, is well qualified for the
position. He has been a resident
and farmer in the county for
years and still owns several hun
dred acres of farm land in the
Winona section. Before coming
west he was employed for seven
years in office work in the east
and is well able to handle the
office and field work capably and
in a manner satisfactory to the
taxpayers.
J. J. Staley, candidate for
county school superintendent,
needs no words of commendation.
His record for the past two years
speaks for itself.
Will Sell Many Shorthorns
Ivan Jorgens, one of the pros
perous farmers of the Nezperce
section, was in the city late last
week scattering bills for a big
sale of purebred and grade live
stock at his farm on October
31st. Mr. Jorgens has a fine lot
of registered Shorthorn cattle
from the best strains in the north
west and will offer 27 head of
these animals for sale, besides a
nice lot of grade cattle, horses
and hogs. He is making the
sale on account of being over
stocked on his farm and is giving
an opportunity for stockmen and
farmers to secure some fancy
stock at moderate prices. Read
the large sale ad. in this issue
and attend the sale on the 31st

a
Three more capable men than
the democratic candidates for
county commissioner could hard
ly be found in the county. Geo
Tinker, from the first district,
stands high in his community
and will fill the office with honor.
August Schroeder, from the
second district, has served cap
ably on both the Keuterville and
Cottonwood highway district
boards and has helped to build
some of the best highways with
in the county. He is a far-see
ing, capable farmer and stock
man, square and substantial as
they make them, and will prove
an ideal man to head the county
board. Jay Rhoades has resided
in the county for many years
and is known everywhere as one
of its solid citizens. He comes
from the third district, knows its
requirements thoroughly, and
will add material strength to the
board. Remember these three
when making your selections for
county commissioner.
Marsh W. Brown, candidate
for surveyor, is a young man who
will bring ability and energy to
that office. He is now holding
an important position with the
state surveying crew in this
county and is well equipped, to
handle the work of the office. If
elected he will do the county
work rapidly and correctly. *
For probate judge, Wilbur L.
Campbell will fill the office cap
ably and with satisfaction to all.
He is a bright, young attorney at
the county seat who is well able
to handle the office and will give
it the attention and legal knowl
edge which the office demands.
George W. Trenary, candidate
for coroner, has been a resident
of Kooskia for some years, and
is well prepared to look after this
office if elected.
Idaho has one candidate for
office on the state ticket—Ernest
L. Parker of Cottonwood, candi
date for lieutenant governor.
Mr. Parker has been a member
of the state legislature from this
county and accomplished mnch
for the county while in office.
He has served as county com
missioner in old Nez Perce county
and has held a number of ap
pointive offices, being at this
time a member of the board of
trustees of the Orofino asylum.
He is one of the few north Idaho
men on either ticket this year
and should receive the vote of
every citizen of this county, re
gardless of politics. He is a man
in every way worthy of your
vote and will be able to accom
plish much for the future wel
fare of this part of the state.
You can expect little or nothing
from his opponent in south Idah<\
Vote for PARKER for Ijèu ten

Stricker-Bieren Wedding.
The wedding of Miss Matilda
Strieker and Nickolas Bieren was
solemn ized Tuesday morning at
the local Catholic church, Rev.
Father Willibrord officiating. Af
ter the ceremony the wedding
party repaired to the home of the
bride's mother in this city where
an elegant wedding feast was en
jo e 1. The wedding was a quiet
affair, only the relatives and close
friends being present. In the
evening a free dance was given
at the K. C. hall by the happy
couple to their many friends and
was largely attended and enjoyed.
Both of the contracting parties
are well and favorably known
and have a large number of
friends who wish them a long
and happy married life. They
will reside in a cottage recently
purchased by the groom in the
north end of town.

ulations.

the highest price it has reached
there for years.
Frank Frankford this season
sold $243 worth of potatoes which
he raised on two acres of ground,
on the edge of American ridge,
about two miles from Juliaetta.
At this yield 160 acres would
have brought $19,440.
Two Chinamen were arrested
at Lewiston late last week and a
small quantity of liquor siezed.
The liquor was brought to that
place from San Francisco in a

The offenders were held under
$250 bonds each.
The 23-months old child of Loy
Sampson, which was stricken re

Wallace Reid of Big Bear ridge
raised a fine crop of beans this
year on a 21-acre field, He har
vested 189 sacks from the 21
acres, making an average of 9
sacks to the acre for which he
received $6.10 per hundred
pounds. The total amount re
ceived for the crop was $1680, or
an average of $80 per acre. Two
years ago Mr. Reid bought the
land for $70 an acre, so this
years crop will clear almost
enough to pay for the land.—

Big Profits in Farming
Who wouldn't be a farmer on
Camas Prairie this year. They
are all making big money, not
only the fellow who farms his
own land but the renters as well.
As evidence of this fact we quote
the following: H. H. Nuxollowns
a 160-acre farm southeast of
town, of which 152 acres are un
der cultivation. He had the
place rented this year to F. J.
Kolbeck and Theo. Toennis.
From the former he got as his
one-third of the crop from 56
acres, wheat to the value of
$1139.50; from the latter as his
share of the crop from 96 acres,
wheat to the value of $1928.23,
or a total of $3067.73 net receipts
from one-third of the crop in a
single year. This would make
the entire crop bring more than
$9,000, or a sum sufficient to
have purchased many choice
quarter sections of land here a
few years ago. Verily, who
wouldn't be a farmer.

Herman Bicksei Dies Suddenly
Herman Bicksei, a well known
and prosperous farmer of the
Canfield section, was found dead
in his barn on Thursday morning
of last week, having apparently
died from heart failure while
tending to his horses. The de
ceased, who was about 54 years
of age, had been troubled with
heart attacks for some time. On
the day of his death he had gone
to the barn to water his horses
and had watered one team and a
saddle horse. Later a woman
employed at the place went to
the barn to get her saddle horse
and saw him lying apparently
asleep in the stall. She notified
Mrs. Bicksei and the latter im
mediately went to investigate
and found her husband dead and
the body almost cold.
Herman Bicksei was one of the
early settlers of the Doumecq
plains country and was highly
respected by all of his neighbors
and acquaintances. He was a
brother-in-law of the Moughmer
brothers, residing south of this
place, and is said to have been a
man of considerable property.
The funeral was held at the
family home last Friday and the
remains were brought to this
place for burial Saturday after
noon.

Another Nice Stock Shipment
J. L. Bond and several neigh
bors brought out four carloads of
fat cattle the first of the week
from their ranch on the Joseph
and sold them to John Baer for
shipment to Carsteen & Co. at
Tacoma. The cattle were by
long odds the best bunch shipped
from across the river this season
and brought 5[ and 6i cents a
pound in the local yards. Mr.
Bond owned the larger part of
shipment, having about three
carloads.
Mr. Baer also shipped a car of
hogs to Spokane that day which
he purchased from the local Far
mers Union Warehouse company
and another car was shipped to
Seattle by the Cottonwood Mill
ing Company.
Six carloads of livestock,
valued at between $13,000 and
$14,000, shipped from this place
in a single week, is a record not
at all to be ashamed of, and the
best part is that these shipments
are weekly occurrences almost
the year around.
Work Progressing
On New Garage
Joseph Lasker, who has the
contract for the new Peterson
block, finished the concrete
foundation work Tuesday and on
Wednesday put a crew of twelve
men at work removing the dirt
from the lot and will start work
at once putting in the cement
floor. The sewer pipes are now
being laid and it is planned to
have everything in shape to com
mence work on the walls as soon
as the brick arrives. The brick
is being shipped here from Pa
louse City and Mr. Peterson says
if the weather holds the building
will be completed and ready Jo
move into by December 1st.
The building will be a two
story structure of brick and con
crete and will cost in the neigh
borhood of $10,000 when com
pleted. It will give Cottonwood
one of the best equipped garages
in northern Idaho when com
pleted.
