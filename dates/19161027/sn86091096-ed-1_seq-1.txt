NUMBER 43
GOVERNOR ALEXANDER
VISITS KENDRICK
^Addressed Citizens at The
Theatre Monday
Governor Alexander and E. L.
Parker reached Kendrick at three
^ock Monday afternoon, by means
■V? a railroad speeder. This is
probably the first time a convey
ance of this kind has ever been
used for campaign purposes. While
it is a novel idea it is a practicable
one as the governor has been able
to make an average of three speak
ing points a day.
The meeting opened at the Bar
num Theatre after the Kendrick
band had played several selections
on the street. The crowd was not
large but. the closest attention was
accorded the governor during his
speech, which was opened with a
glowing tribute to President Wil
son.
In striking contrast to most of
the speeches that have been made
here during the campaign
governor refrained from censuring
his opponent or criticising him in
any way—in fact name of D. W.
Davis was not mentioned in his
address. His remarks were con
fined mainly to the beneficial legis
lation that has been passed during
the democratic administration, both
in national and state affairs. He
referred particularly to the federal
reserve banking law, the child la
bor law, the federal good roads law
the 1
bor law, the federal good roads law
and last the greatest piece of legis
lation that has ever been enacted,
the rural credits law, a law that,
when once in force will save the
farmers of the United States one
hundred and fifty millions of dollars
annually in interest charges alone.
The central idea of his speech
was that he came to the men and
women of Idaho with a message of
executive of the nation, President
Woodrow Wilson.
Henrietta Sheets Hewett
Henrietta Sheets Hewett - was
born at Mt. Sterling, Iowa, Febru
peace and prosperity, a condition
due in a large meagre to the chief 1
ary 20, 1864. She died at her |
home near Southwick, Idaho, Octo- J
ber 17, 1916 at the age of 32. She j
married William Hewett March 10,
1882 and to this union were born j
six children two of whom are dead. |

husband and four daughters. Her j
daughters are: Mrs. I. H. Sfalma
ker of Ahsahka, Idaho ; Mrs. Fred
Whitinger of Southwick. Idaho;
Marie and Opal Whitinger, who are
living at home. |
Twelve years ago she was con
verted and with her husband united
with the Methodist Episcopal
church. Her last hours of suffer- j
ing gave evidence of a living faith

Stevens Will Recover
Fred Stevens of Lapwai, who was
shot by Special Officer Hanson at
Lapwai on Saturday, October 7,
will recover. That is the opinion
of the attending physicians. His
recovery will be due to the fact
that he had a remarkably strong
constitution, for the wound affected
the liver and in addition double
pneumonia developed. Sunday it
was felt that the, crisis had passed
and all conditions indicate he will
now steadily improve. For a per
iod it had been felt he had only the
slightest of chances to recover.

Editorial Correspondence
Conditions Political and Otherwise From Some
Eastern States.
of Our
Editor Gazette
If there is ever a wet place on j
earth when the rain pours steadily
for twenty-four hours, it is Chicago.
This was the condition that greeted
us when we arrived* from Freeport.
The first thing noticeable is the
fact that Chicago has grown and is
growing. In 1876 we stopped at
the Grand Pacific Hotel then the
largest hotel in the west but now it
nestles among the skyscrapers still
quite cozy and comfortable but no
longer the center of hotel attrac
tions. So it is in all lines of busi
ness. After visiting nrovincial cit
ies such as Omaha, Sioux City and
Freeport one is naturally impressed
with the multitudes that throng the
streets of Chicago twenty-four
hours in every day. Why there are
no serious congestions of travel
seems strange at first but after
even a superficial observation it is
seen that nobody loiters in this
bustling city. Everyone is going
somewhere and he always goes in a
hurry. That's all.
As to the politics of this city no
one seems to know. The great up
heaval in the city government was
the featured idea in the daily pa
pers, but this had not fully devel
oped. If the District Attorney
can finish what he started, it will
drive a number of decent men into
the Wilson Camp. The Democrats
also seem to have the best of the
argument in the race for governor.
The same conditions prevail here as
in Iowa in reference to the gover
norship. This of course influences^
the national election to some extent.
Predictions are frequently heard
and that too from reliable sources
that Wilson will run well in Illinois.
About ten years ago we saw in
Chicago a huge sign extending a
cross a building centrally located.
The sign read "Workman's Ex
change." Curious to know what
the workmen had to exchange we
entered. Here was a very narrow
room 100 feet long and a bar run
ning the entire length. We found
a crowd of "American citizens?" of
which we never felt proud, exchang
ing their nickels for beer. A few
days ago we again entered this
same thirst emporium. The room
had been materially widened. Evi
dently a partition had been remov
ed. The same old gang were still
there, crowded almost to suffoca
tion. This crowd of 100 men were
as tough a looking company as one
could find in a year's travel and yet
as these go politically so goes Chi
cago and often the state. It is cer
tainly humiliating but what areycu
going to do about it? Goodby Chi
to
in

al
still forever, fare thee well.
cago, fare thee well, and if forever,
Three
days in Chicago was all the time we
could spare.
The conductor "put me off at
Buffalo." Here is a city that
would bear description but this is
not our object. It was hgre that
McKinlev was shot and here he
died. We would say after a brief
acquaintance that Buffalo
Hughes town. Everything seems
to point in that direction and we
have no doubt that this wonderful
city will help swell the up-state
majority for Hughes. There are
some personal memories lingering
in and about the city that make
our stay hSre interesting but these
have nothing to do with this cor
respondence.
Of course the visitor to Buffalo
is expected to take in Niagara Falls.
There too he is expected to go into
ecstacies over this wonderful natur
al phenomenon. One who has tra
velled in the Seven Devils country,
has seen Shoshone Falls in southern
Idaho and knows of the Great Can
yon of Colorado, would naturally
have higher expectations before
viewing the greatest cataract in the
world. At least we were disap
pointed—not as to the volume of
water pouring over the falls, for
that is tremendous, but the falls
themselves did not meet expecta
tions.
to
The Rapids are far-reaching
and instructive. With these we
were greatly impressed. Goat Is
land which separates the Horseshoe
Falls from the American Falls be
longs to New York. Here the hand
of man has aided nature. The Is
land is left in its pristine beauty
but convenient trails have been
made with rare judgement. After
travelling over all the trails the
visitor finds that he has viewed the
Falls from every possible angle and
he freely admits that this natural
wonder grow upon him.
On the Canadian side we find
much more formality. Here the
soldier with fixed bayonet is every
where in evidence. For some dis
tance we pursued our journey un
molested but finally a husky looking |
soldier stepped in front of us and \
demanded the "pass", but as we
neither had the pass nor the token
of the pass and no one to supply it
for us, we gracefully acknowledged
that we were merely perambulating
miscellaneously through space with
out any definite object in view, and
we cheerfully turned back thanking

the Lord that we were an American
citizen where passes were not de
manded of one who seemed to know
his business.
Gustavus H. Dammare 11
Gustavus Hannaford Dammarell
died at the home of his son, E. H.
Dammarell in Kendrick, early yes
terday morning. An hour before
he died he was walking about the
house apparently feeling as well as
usual. He was taken suddenly ill
and went back to bed, death follow
ing an hour later.
Mr. Dammarell was born in Dev
onshire, England, May 27, 1837 and
died at the age of 79 years. He I
ing
ber
moved to Prince Edward Island and
from there to northern Minnesota.
About fourteen years ago he moved
to Cloverland, Washington and six
years ago to Kendrick where he has
made his home with his son.
Mr. Dammarell was a wagon
maker in the early days and it was
always an interesting subject for
him to tell of the work and time it
took to make a wagon without the
use of modern tools and machinery.
He was a member of the Methodist
church, a man of sterling character
and his kindly face will be miésed
by his many friends in Kendrick.
He leaves two children, E. H.
Dammarell of Kendrick and Mrs.
J. H. Prentiss of Asotin, Washing
ton. Funeral services will be held
at Asotin where he will be buried
near the graves of his wife and son.
Anna Gräber Tschantz
Mrs. Joseph Tschantz nee Anna
Gräber was born at Hegenheimer,
Germany, June 10, 1881. She died
0ctober 21 * 1916 at Moscow, at the
age of 35.
January 24, 1907 she was married
to Joseph Tschantz and to this
union six children were born, fivé
boys and one girl, one boy dying in
infancy. She had four brothers in
this country besides other brothers
and sisters in Germany.
Mrs. Tschantz united with the
Mennonite church when but fifteen
years of age and lived in that faith
until the end came. Her home was
near Leland, where she had a host
of friends who deeply regret her
death and who extend to the be
reaved husband and children their
u t mos t sympathy,

Guitar Selections by Joseph
Kukuku Especially Good.
I and called forth heart y applause.
A large crowd attended the lyce
um course entertainment at the
Barnum Theatre Tuesday night and
on all sides could be heard expres
sions of approval of the program
that was rendered. The only criti
cism heard was that the musical
numbers lacked variety.
Hawaiian musicians are very
much in demand at the present
time, not on account of superior
classics nor technique, but because
their music is unlike that of any
other nation. They played with
the verve and vim of poetic aban
donment and featured home ballads,
plantation and folk songs and selec
tions especially rendered for talk
ing machine by Kekuku and his
quintet.
Joseph Kekuku, who gave a num
ber of beautiful selections on the
guitar, is conceded to be the world's
greatest solo guitarist. He is the
originator of the celebrated steel
method of guitar playing. His se
lections were by far the most pop
ular part of the program.
The farewell love song "Aloha
Oe" sung by the quintet with the
ukelele, violin and guitar aecom
panient was a very pleasing number
Band Around Duck's Leg
If you kill or capture a wild duck
bearing an aluminum band around
one leg, having a number on one
side, and on the other a statement
requesting that the United States
Department of Agriculture, or the
Biological Survey, be notified, you
are requested to send this band at
once to the Bureau of Biological
Survey, Department of Agriculture,
Washington, D. C. This band, if
accompanied, by a statement as to
date, place, and circumstances un
der which the bird was taken, will
be of service to the Survey in its
efforts to determine the longevity
of individual ducks and the routes
of migration of the species. The
bands are being attached to consid
erable numbers of wild duck of
several species which were cured of
the duck sickness prevalent around
Great Salt Lake, Utah, and there
released. The department is par
ticularly anxious to secure reports
from these birds to determine their
complete recovery from this malady
which has killed hundreds of thou
sands of ducks in Utah.
Boy Raises Bean Crop
Juliaett, Idaho.—A 17 year-old
boy who was raising a crop of beans
on his father,s farm on Cream ridge
—the father and son sharing equally
—was given a check for $1790 for
his half of crop. The name of the
boy is McFadden. The average
yield of the crop was 1130 pounds of
beans per acre.
Frank Frankford, who farms on
the edge of American ridge, about
two miles from Juliaetta, this season
has sold his crop of potatoes from
two acres that brought him $243,
If he had had in 160 acres they
would have brought at the above
rate $19,440.
Raises Pay of Women
Henry Ford, the automobile man
ufacturer, announced after a con
ference with President Wilson this
week that as the result of an inspir
ing talk he had with the president
established
1 two weeks ago, he had
^ women^orkers^m his plantjop
on the same pay basis as the men
and that he looked forward with
confidence to the complete vindica
tion of the principle.
