As Result of Motion by County
Attorney Ruffcorn.
NOT SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE !
Docket for Term is Cleared When
Ten Criminal Cases are
Thrown Out.
District court convened Monday j
morning with Judge F. N. Utter pre- !
siding, with about 40 present out of
the total of 90 jurymen called to serve
during this term. A number of crim- !
inal cases were on the calendar to
come up for trial at this term of court,
lut no cases were tried.
Motion for dismissal was made as
cach case was called for hearing, by
County Attorney Ruffcorn, who stated
he had not sufficient evidence to se-:
cure a conviction. The only exenp-:
tion in the motions was that of the,
charge of Chu:;. Snutn who was al
leged to have been connecte. I with a
cattle stealing gang and with having
received stolen property. In this
case the County Attorney stated that
an important and material witness was
not available.
Sheriff Powell has served sub
poeneas upon all the witnesses ex
cept this one, in the Smith case, and
had also brought some of the alleged
stolen stock to Glasgow as evidence.
He had gone to considerable trouble
and also expense to have his evidence

ing the matter to trial but was forced
to let witnesses and evidence return j
home as a result of the action taken. :
Those cases in which the sheriff s
offiee had made arrests and which were j
of vital importance to the county be- j
ing dismissed made it necessary for, a
new complaints to be made. In these
Sheriff Powell had made new arrests :
and the parties alleged to have violât-,
ed the laws are now being held to
the district court for the next term.
The course taken by the county at
torney has made it necessary for ad
ditional work upon the part of the
sheriff and his deputies but owing to
their having several cases for action,
against most of those who had their |
cases dismissed it was possible to,
hold them.
There were no other cases to come

I be Hon. W. J. Bannen and Hon. Geo.

As the time for casting votes draws
nenr the outlook for a clean sweep!
of the county ticket by the Repub
licans appears to be an assured fact
I and the candidates are going to per
! sonally visit the various precincts in
order that they may come in closer
touch with the voters and make their;
final appeal to them for their sup
port on November seventh. Those
men who are now holding office have
been busy attending to the affairs of
the countv and have had but little time
to get out among the voters so that
j it will be the first appearance of some
! of them in the more remote sections
of the county. Their records while in
office has been such as to recommend
! them to the voters to another term.
j j,\p COMPETITION THREATENS
The Republican National Committee
bas received a communication from
j f; 0 | )ert Garland, President of the
: chamber of Commerce of Pittsburg,
regarding the menace to certain Am
j er it-an industries on account of Jap
j anese competition. "Japan, through
a new Japanese freght law whose es
tablishment was induced largely by
: tbe i ow tar ;ff } n t he United States, re
eently began sending her milled cot
ton aiK ] other factory products to this
country, thereby inaugurating a sys
tem of the most ruinous competition
that ever jeopardized the prosperity
of the American workmen," he says.
"As a result of the competition of
ten-twenty-thirty oriental labor
| j a p an already has captured consider
a t,i e of our baseball bat business, and
for some time past has been supply
ing the text books to our California
schools. Only a Democratic tariff j
would make possible this alien inva-,
sion directed toward our national game'
and sacred public institutions. j
These foreign manufacturers who,
enjoy bounty at the expense of ourj
itizens through the courtesy of the;
Democratic party pay no direct or,
indirect taxes to the United States,
but our own plants are compelled to
pay Federal, as well as local taxes.
CORRECTING AN ERROR
I State Superintendent Davee now ad
mits that he was in error when he cer
| tified a few weeks ago, that Miss May
! Trumper, Republican nominee for that
! important office, did not hold a state
j certificate. His office records show
j that she has held a life certificate for
! more than ten years, issued by his
office. He is now correcting the false
statement previously sent out.

Saturday night at 9 o'clock in the

staged when three prominent candi

addresses to the people. The party
will consist of George W. Farr, can

three candidate are making a tour of
the state and have covered the west

final swing to the eastern end of the
state and will return by way of the
Northern Pacific. j
G. W. Farr, Republican candidate!
for Congress is a man of known quali-jfor
fications as he has been a resiednt of ;
the state for many years living at
Miles City where as an attorney and j
as District .Judge he has made a most!
enviable record for himself as a man j
and firmly established his ability to,
properly interperate the laws. He,
has held the Judiciary position for
several years and during that time
has demonstrated his integrity
faithfulness to duty. As a candidate j
for congress he represents the type of j
man who will concientiously perform !
the duties entrusted to him, and who!
will be faithful to the trust imposed,
upon him. Montana can not Ana ;
anywhere a person better fitted to !
look after the interests of the peo-,
pie of this state in Washington, nor ,
one who will work more earnestly !
for the betterment of conditions in
the state than Mr. Farr. In this

Republican Nominee for State Super- ,

She Desires Election. ;
Miss May Trumper. who will speak 1
here on Saturday evening in the in
terests of her candidacy for the po- j
sition of superintendent of public in
struction of the state of Montana on
the republican ticket, has for nineteen;
years been a resident of Montana and,
interested in her schools. Her candi- 1
dacy for the office of superintendent
of public instruction is based upon;
her record throughout thes3 years |
as well as upon her previous record j
as a teacher in Ohio and upon her
educational training.
;
She is a graduate of the London |
(Ohio) high school and of the Pres- :
byterian college, formerly located at
Granville, Ohio. Her first experience!
in teaching was received in the rural j
schools of Ohio. Later she taught m i
the Granville (Ohio) high school and:
was principal of the high school at ; ,
Bryan, Ohio, for four year. Th« s. m- j
mcr of 1898 was spent at the Har-j
i
° " 1
j vurd tummer school.
In 1899 she began work
tana in the eighth grade of the Kalis
j pell schools and the following year
was given work in English and Latin
in the Flathead county high school
at Kalispell, which position she held
for six and one-half years,
In 1906
,
.
she was elected county superintend
ent of schools of Flathead county
and for four successive terms held
that office.
In 1914 the desire for further
study led her not to seek re-election j
to the county superintendency. She
spent a half year and summer ses-i
sion at the University of California
and the following year and summer
session at Columbia university, New,
York. In both of these institutions (
she took work with leading educa-,
tors of the country and specialized
rural education, methods and school j
administration. i

more votes so that his election ap

several times. His record for law
enforcement is responsible for the
high regard in which he is held and
esteemed by all who know his official
work and the reputation now held
promises to be very greatly increased
if he is elected to the office of At
torney General. His ability to in
terpert the law is well recognized and j
he is thoroughly and admirably fitted,
the responsible position to which
he aspires. His success at the polls !
this fall will mean a full enforcement!
of the laws upon the statutes and a j
strict adhereing to the proper admin- !
istration of the office.
In the meeting Saturday night she
will not make a speech, but will tell
what has been her experience in the
educational world, and what her am-.
andlbitions are and also what her plans !
are for the continued upbuilding of
the schools of Montana are. The!
office for which she is a candidate is
one of extreme responsibility and
those who are interested in the schools
especially the women voters, should
make it a point to attend the meeting
at the Orpheum on Saturday night
and hear what Miss Trumper has to
say.
There will be music by the Glas
gow band, a big bonfire and all the
other attractive features that goes to
make a regular old time rally worth
going to see.
mer experience in the county superin
te "dency, has given her insight into
current problems in education and
has especially prepared her to handle
the problems of the rural schools, to
which much of her time has been
devoted the past ten years. (
If elected, Miss Trumper declares
that she will during her term of of
fice strive for equlity of opportun

the betterment of rural schools, par
ticularly through improvement
the quality of instruction; for the I
freedom of educational affairs, both|
county and state, from politics, and
for the growth and upbuilding of all !
institutions of learning, to the end
that they may serve the purposes for

which they were created.
The office for which Miss Mav Trum

SPOTTED PROSPERITY
The administration points to our
prosperity. Where is it? In Massa
chusetts? Yes. In California? No.
In Connecticut? Yes. In Oregon?
( No. In Pennsylvania? Yes. In
Washington ? No. In the Missis
injsippi Valley? Yes. In the western
j Mountain states? No. Certain
i sections have industrial inflation, but
other parts of the country have de
pression. Genuine prosperity must;
be nation-wide.
But our so-called prosperity today
is sectional. It appears only in spots.
It is a spotted prosperity—spotted and
stained. Wherever the war has dir
ectly reached the sources of produc- ;
tion, business is good; elsewhere busi-'
ness is bad. We must have a tariff
that will protect all parts of the coun
try alike in peace as well as in war,

before the war, that surplus will be
greater after the war. Unless we sell
abroad, we will have congestion
and make our prosperity
steady and national.
The capture of foreign trade is only
less necessary than the preservation
of our home markets and it will be
j larc j cr to accomplish. Yet it must

°f a panic. An unsold surplus is the
blood clot in the heart of business.
For a long time the nations at war
cannot buy from us except in special
lines, more than a small part of what
they were buying three year ago. We
must win and keep our just share of
those markets which our great rivals
once monopolized. Our immediate
field of trade expansion is South Am
erica, the Orient, Africa, the undevel
oped and backward countries of the
world. We have been mad that we
did not turn every energy to securing
those markets when war called our
rivals from them. Instead of build
ing up this normal free trade which
would have lasted ai d increased, we
turned our energies to making muni
tions, an abnormal trade which will
suddenly end, leaving hundreds of
thousands of men without work, mil
lions of capital unemployed, and dis
rupting still more our disorganized
business. But the folly is committed
and we must face our ha"d task not
with mutual reproaches, but with
stout hearts, united wills, and con
structive minds.

Last Sunday afternon at about
ly'iO P. M. occurred the death of Oa

Valley county and for the past 17
years a resident of the city of Glas
gow. Mr. Schuler's death was at
atjtributed to dropsy brought on as a
result of failing health which condi
tion had existed for the past year.
He passed away peacefully at the
home of Mrs. Martha Knowles where
! he had been living for some time.
! Funeral services were conducted Tues
day afternoon at the Congregational
church by the Independent Order of
Odd Fellows of which organization he
had been a member for many years.
Mr. Schuler was well known
throughout the entire northeastern
portion of Montana not only in what
was formally Valley county but in
Dawson and Custer counties as well.
All who knew him admired him and
his death will be mourned by them all.
He was a man of even temperment,
cheerful and most obliging, and never
failed to respond to the call of those
who might desire his service and
would go out of his way to do a friend
a favor. In all the years he lived in
Glasgow he was never known to speak
slightingly of anyone.
