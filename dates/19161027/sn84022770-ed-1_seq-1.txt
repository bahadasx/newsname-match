PENSION RESERVES
REPUBLICAN SHOWS UP FALSE
CHARGES IN INSPECTION
HI KE VU'S HE PORT
That tikere to a deficiency of 500,-
000 or any si'.m whatever in pension
fund reserves of the industrial Insur
ance commission, as charged by the
bureau of inspection, is denied by the
commission in a report written by
John M. Wilson the republican mem
ber, who declares the published asser
tion of tbe Alleged shortage to be
"incorrect and mPleading."
As assistant attorney general, Mr.
Wilson was legal advisor of the in
dustrial insurance commission ant.
convicted OI!llr« twice last winter for
frauds upon tfc<* accident funds of the
department, following which Wilson
was appointed commissioner upon re
organization of that body. He is con
sidered an authority on industrial In
surance law end administration in
this state.
In reply to the bureau's findings he
made the following official state
ment:
"Incorrect and Misleading."
"The published statement of the
report of the bureau of Inspection of
its examination of tho industrial in
surance department to the effect that
a shortage of $500,000 exists in the
reserve fund is both incorrect and
misleading and an unjust criticism
upon the administration of the law
by the departm o nt.
"The plain truth is that there is
no shortage in the reserve fund. This
statement is based upon an assump
tion that under the present method of
computing reserves tbe fund is now
insufficient to the extent of approxi
mately $500,000 by reason of the fact
that the law itonlf does not provide
for the putting rsido of a sufficient
sum to care for tho expectancy of
life under the American mortality
tables.
"Subdivision 'e,' section 5, of chap
ter 74, laws of 1911, being the Work
men's Compensation Law, provides
'that for every case of injury result
ing in death or permanent total dis
ability, it shall be the duty of the
department to forthwith notify the
state treasurar, and he shall set apart
out of the accident fund a sum of
money for thi case to be known as
the estimated lump valuo of th«
monthly payments provided for it, to
be calculated upon the theory that a
monthly payment of S2O to a person
SO years of a;e, is equal to a lump
Bum payment, according to the expec
tancy of life as fixed by the Ameri
can mortality tables of $5,000, but
the total in no case to exceed the
sum of $4000."
Oomniiswlon's Hands Tied.
He tnen quotes an opinion given
by the attorney general January 9,
1912, and adds:
"It will thus be seen that the lr.w
by its plain provision and as inter
preted by the attorney general, lim
its the amount which can be set aside
by the commission in any particular
case to S4OOO.
"It is further provided in sub
division 'e,' section 5, above quoted,
that 'any deficiency shall be made
good out of and any balance or over
plus shall revert to the accident
fund.'
"It develops from actual experi
ence in the administration of the law
that the sum cf S4OOO is inadequate
to provide a sufficient reserve fund
to pay pensions throughout the ex
pectancy, of life. It is still an open
question as ti whether the refund
into the accident fund by reason of
deaths and remarriages will be suf
ficient to take rare of the insufficient
sum originally set aside to the re
serve under the I'mitation of S4OOO.
"It is a fact that the reserve fund
necessary to provide pensions for the
period of life expectancy to widows
and totally disabled persons und?r
30 years of age is more than S4OOO
Whether that will be over-balanced
by the reversions above mentioned
cannot be definitely determined unt'l
the law has been administered for a
lonper period of years. It was intended
by the law that, is plainly express
ed If there is a deficiency it shall be
set aside later. The inconsistency of
this provision would require the in
dustries of the future to take care of
the accidents of today, directly con
trnry. to the statement of tho policy
of tho law.

"However, there matters are all
matters for legislative consideration
Two legislatures have been in session
since the law was passed and no cor
rections have oesn made, presumably
tor the reason Mint the experience or
the administratis of the Jaw was not
sufficient to enable them to provide
the remedy if any is needed. If, r.s a
matter of fact, the present system of
reserves as provided by the law s
inadequate, it should be remedied b>

of Centralia.
Every seat was filled in the Wood

by the speakers was both spontan

excellent singing was furnished by
their glee club.
At the conclusion of the meeting

His reputation among the camps

every part of the county, his exper

OLYMPIA, WASHINGTON, FRIDAY, OCTOBER 27, 1916
LISTER AGAINST JILL REFERENDUM MEASURES
GOVERNOR FLATLY OPPOSES ALL MEASURES ON THE BAL
LOT THIS FALL AM) URGES EVERRODY TO VOTE
AGAINST THEM
In a signe.l statement read before
the great Wilson rally in the Metro
politan theatro in Seattle last Fri
day evening. Governor Ernest Lister
came out flat forced against the sev
en referendum measures and tho con
stitutional amendment to be voted on
November 7, and urged all the prog
ressive forces of >he state to unito in
the campaigu to defeat them. The
governor's statement has thrown con
sternation into the Republican ranks,
because their candidate, Henry Mc-
Brfde, who Cairns to have been a
progressive once, is running on r.
platform endorsing all these meas
ures and hi 3 campaign committee is
joining with the Employers' assoc'a
tion and the Washington business
league in the campaign to have them
passed.
Governor Lister's statement of his
views is:
There should be no division in the
ranl.s of the believers in popular gov
ernment in this campaign. Whatever
doubt there may be in the minds -»f
some as to the several referendum
measures proposed, there can be no
question as to tfce character of the
fo-ces definitely aligned in their sup
port.
Several Extremely Vicious.
The rule of safaty demands united
action. Several of the measures pro
posed are vicious in the extreme, and
threaten the destruction of the entire
plan of the Initiative Referendum,
Recall and Direct Primary. If the is
sur becomes clouded or vague, these
measures may succeed. Under the cir
cunptances, it seems to me to be
the sail course that the forces of
popular government should oppose,
without exception, all of the Refer
endum Measures now before the peo
ple.
Eight measures passed by the last
Republican Legislature have been re
ferred to a vote of the people of the
state of Washington to be passd on
at tn coming election on November 7.
Among these laws are Referendum
Measures Nos. 3 and 4, directed

WORD SKETCHES OF HOHPARTISAN CANDIDATES
Intimate Glimpses at Those Who Aspire to County Office on
Their Ability Alone, Who Are Making Their Campaigns on
Their Individual Merit, and Who Owe No Allegiance to Any
"Machine."
W. J. ABBOTT | 1 GEO. P. YANTIS |
Non-Partisan Candidate for j | Non-Partisan Candidate for
COUNTY TREASURER | Re-election as |
' | PROSECUTING ATTORNEY
When the writer of these short
word sketches of the Non-Partisan
candidates started out to find out
something about W. J. Abbott, the
candidate for county treasurer, ho
discovered right off the reel a some
what peculiar thing these days—
every Democrat he talked to said Mr.
Abbott was a Republican and every
Republican said he was a Democrat,
which just went to bear out the In
dependent character of the man from
the political standpoint, and to sub
stantiate his own statement that he
had never voted a straight ticket in
his life, but had alwr.ys voted for the
man he thought best fitted for the
Job, regardless of what his politics
might be.
And so when Mr. Abbott became a
candidate for county office on the
ticket who3e cardinal principle Is the
individual merit of the candidates,
he was merely fulfilling his own life
long political viewpoint, and demon
strating that his long years of polit
ical independence in th-? voting booth
would characterize the adminietra
tion of the office to which he aspires,
if he is elected.
j Mr. Abbott hao lived in Thurston
.county since boyhood—ss years, to
be exact. He knows nearly every
body and nearly everybody knows
him, and as he jokingly tells his
friends in the current campaign, "My
'record is well known. I've never
been arrested, never been in Jail."
Seriously speaking, he is a man
whose reputation for strict honesty,
high ability end sterling independ
ence is county-wide.
In recent yea re he lias been run
ning his 300-acre farm at South
Union. For ten years, until the com
pany was sold to another local tirin
year ago, he was manager of the
Farmers' Co-Operative Creamery of
this city. He is recognized through
out the county as a successful farmer
and businecs man, a man who has
devoted all his life to promotion of

and Recall and No. 5, directed against
the Direct Primary. These three
measures I consider are among the
moat, if not the most, pernicious laws
ever paused by th? Legislature in this
str.te against the fundamental rights
of the people under our popular
government. The masses of the
people of this state, under the
direction of organizations composed
of men and women interested In ad
vancing and protecting the rights of
the common _i:an under our institu
tion of popular government, have
banded themselves together for the
purpose of defeating these three
meaeures now being referred to the
pecple of this rtate. On the other
hand, there can be ho dispute as to
the character of tbe forces united in
support of all them referred measures
intended to curtail the principle of
popular government.
Approves Clayton Act.
My attention has been called to the
provisions of the Clayton Act recently
enccted by a Democratic National
Congress. Thii *cf clearly defines the
respective rights of labor and capital
in their several disputes. The general
plan there outlinod I can give, and da
give, my unqualified approval. My
own personal record as a workman
and associate member of labor organ
izations, and my entire record as a
public man, clearly emphasizes to
everyono that feeling of sympathy
which I have for the cause of labor.
Notwithstanding the position for
mer'y taken by me in respect to Ref
erendum Measure No. 6, known as
the Antl-Picketine Bill, and after
mature consideration of the drastic
provisions of this measure, and in the
light of the scope of the Clayton Act,
passed by a Democratic Congress and
approved by Presi dent Wilson, which
in my opinion and in the opinion of
organized labor goes far to compose
tho difference between labor and cap
ital, I shall unite with the forces
mentioned above to urge the defeat
of this, and all other measures re
ferred to the people at this election.
Two years ago the voters of Thur
stor. county, disgusted with the inac-
Mor of the previous two years, upset
the calculations of the Hopkins'
machine, handed a surprise package
to one Thos. L. O'Leary, and elect
ed Geo. F. Yantis prosecuting attor
ney. This fall Yantis is up for re
election on the Non-Partisan ticket,
and O'Leary is trying to come back.
Ett Y antis has a record of activ
ity and accomplishment behind him,
of tlie successful disposition of far
mo-e cases than his opponent ever
bestirred himself to handle, the
trmsaction of an enormous amount
of work that never reached the
courts, a record of convictions In
most of the cases tried —if a man's
success in this office is to be meas
ured by the number of men he sends
10 jail—and an earnestness and sin
cerity of official conduct, that will
re-elect him in spite of all the Hop
kins' machine may do or O'Leary
may say in the current campaign.
There isn't any open gambling in
tLe city of Oiympia now, and as far
us tne social evil is concerned con
ditions are immeasurably better. He
has worked during these last two
; vears tc improve the social conditions
in the city, to promote social welfare,
and 1-0 has rucceeded. And a vast
amount of th s sort of work, particu

I has been done quietly and unobtrus

A luncheon fn celebration of

being made to have Robert
Bridges of Seattle, who is to ad

Strand theatre that evening, to
come to Olympia early enough
to speak at this luncheon. If ho
is not able to do so, the women
will arrange for some other ex

terested in the - candidacy of
President Wilson are invited
and expected to attend the
luncheon.
The Interest being taken by the
women in the present political cam
paign in Thurston county particular

a revelation to tVose who were under
the impression that tney would not

Without any assistance l r om c ere
