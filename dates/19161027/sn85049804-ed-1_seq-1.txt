VOTE FOR
W. L. HARDING
As the oldest colored member of the
Iowa State Bar association and as a
member of the legislative committee,
charged with the duty of watching
and trying to prevent hostile legisla
tion against the colored citizens of
Iowa, I have known you intimately for
years, personally and officially, and I
have at all times found you not only
fair but friendly to the best interest
of the colored citizens of this state.
No one in a northern state, unac
quainted with the artful, deceptive
and misleading wordings and methods
of southern democrats in their trained
and skillful efforts to discriminate
against colored people. But the word
ever seen or guessed that there was
anything wrong with the "Secret Or.
der Bill." There was not a line, word
or syllable on the face of the bill
against colored people. But hte word
ing of it was like the "Grandfather's
Clause," the separate "Jim-Crow" car
acts and segregation ordinances,
framed to outlaw our secret societies
and especially the "colored Elks.
This bill was a copy of th ebill in
troduced and passed by the democrats
of Georgia to destroy the organiza
tion of colored Elks in that state and
it had that effect and ruined them
there and caused all northern Elks of
color to change or modify the name
of their organization from "B. P. O.
E." to "I. B. P. O. E."
Think then of the audacity of urg
ing intelligent colored voters to sup

Republican Candidate for Governor
Election November 7th, 1916.
Buxton, Iowa, Oct. 25, 1916r
Hon. W. L. Harding, Next Governor
of Iowa, Sioux City, Iowa.
My Dear Governor Harding: I beg
to assure you that I have seen the cir
cular or pamphlet purporting to have
been gotten out against you by some
"leading colored men" of Iowa, stat
ing in substance that you are an
enemy to the colored citizens of this
state and that you framed and promot
ed and tried to have the objectionable
"Secret Order Bill" of 1909 passed
against our interest and therefore
urging all colored voters of Iowa to
vote against you and for a democrat
to be the next governor of this state.
democrat and oppose you Be­
cause of this bill? v.', '*.
I had read the Georgia bill and
knew its history and purpose. And so
when this bill appeared in our legufla
ture, I was the very first man to
tect its danger and start opposite
against it. As soon as you under
stood its purpose and nature you as
sured me through my representative,
Hon. Thomas Hickenlooper, of Albia,
Monroe county, Iowa, that the bill
had been casually handed to you
printed in due form by a constituent
oi yours with the request 'that you in
troduce it as a good measure to pro
tect all secret societies from un
worthy delinquents and imposters.
And it rea,dsj
"A bill for an act to protect benevo
lent, humane, fraternal or charitable
corporations in the use of their names
and emblems and providing penalties
for the violation thereof."
I was engaged in the trial of a case
at Albia at the time 'I received the
copy of the bill and before I got your
message I had written and tele
graphed many ministers and members
of our secret societies and had sent out
quite a few letters. That same day I
had phoned my law partner at Des
Moines to take active charge of the
campaign in the legislature against
the bill and the next day I received
notice from him that no further ef
forts would be made to pass the bill.
You will thus see, my dear governor,
•V*
that I have set forth the exact truth
about this "bill" just as all the facts
came to me and as I understood them
at the time. But if you are to be
censured for a mistake which you so
promptly corrected and remedied,
why should yon not be praised and
supported for the faithful and valu
able services you have rendered to the
colored people of this state in bur pro
test against the many southern race
hating bills that came into the 1913
Thirty-fifth general assembly and the
pernicious Miller bill, which was also
carried over into the Thirty-sixth gen
eral assembly of 1915? Every man
of our committee knows that we could
always count on your helpful influence
against each and every one of these
bills.
You said to me openly and plainly
in the presence of the committee that
you did not believe in any discrimina
tion against us and would do all in
your power to,prevent any hostile
legislation against the "colored citi
zens of Iowa."
If men wish to be honorable fend
fair, why not tell the whole truth
about your fairness towards our peo
ple and then "take the money," or
whatever compensation they are get
ting or epecting to get for asking col
ored voters of Iowa to stab a friend
in the back to elect a democrat?
In the face of the "Wilson adminis
tration" and its wholesale outrages
against the self-respect of all colored
citizens of these United States I say
no self-respecting colored voter of
this country anywhere can cast a vote
this year that will add prestige or in
fluence and power to a "democratic
administration." So I wish y^u to
know that above all other things in
Iowa politics at this time, I desire
your election to the governorship.
The election of a democratic gov
ernor in a great republican state like
Iowa would give added injury to the
best interests of the country at large
by placing this state in accord with
the baneful influence of the present
democratic administration at Wash
ington which is destroying the pres
tige of- our great and good country
all over the.world.

EDITOR'S OBSERVATIONS.
On leaving Quincy, 111., we crossed
"the Father of Waters and entered the
great state of Missouri. In many re
spects this commonwealth is one of
the greatest and most unique states in
ONE—Bystander—
the sisterhood of states. Her indus
tries are so diversified that you could
close her up to herself and she could
clothe and feed her millions of people
Without aid from the outside of her
own border. She raises hogs, cattle,
horses, sheep, mules, chickens, tur
keys, ducks and geese. She grows corn,
oats, wheat, rye, potatoes, pumpkins,
melons and nearly all known cereals.
She has her own apples, peaches,
grapes, plums, cherries, etc. She has
rabbits, squirrels, opossums, coons,
wolves, foxes, etc. She mines iron,
coal, stone. She has her schools, col
leges, universities, etc. She has her
own manufacturies, factories and
work shops. She has her own com
mercial clubs and industrial clubs.
She has her own mountains, lakes,
rivers and great springs and health
resorts. Hence I know of nothing else
to say that she needs, fop she has
more good looking women and girls
and young men than any state that I
have yet seen, for it was here in Mis
souri that-1 got my wife. It was this
state that, my father and mother came
from. It was in this state that ye
editor delivered his first public oration
on Emancipation day, when I was only
17 years old, and later taught my first
public school in Holt county. There
fore I have a very warm feeling to
the "show me" state. Our first stop
was in Hannibal, which is one of Mis
souri's oldest towns. We did not stop
here only a few hours, so we did not
observe here. We next stopped in
Paris, a town of about 2,000 people
of which 400 are colored. The col
ored people have a nice new four-room
brick building with two teachers, Prof.
W. E. Donaldson, assisted by Miss
Berry. Both are experienced and well
qualified. Mrs. B. Lasley is a success
ful and highly respected citizen. Mr.
Geo. Berry, Sr., owns valuable prop
erty and is one of the oldest and in
fluential race men. Mrs. M. C. Crump
is a highly respected citizen. Her only
daughter is attending Lincoln Insti
tute.
