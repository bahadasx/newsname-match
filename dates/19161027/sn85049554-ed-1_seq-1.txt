HOPE TO CHECKMAtif
BORDER ATTACK
Federal Officials Claim to Hsve Evi
donee Raids Were Beinjt Planned to
Influence American Political Situa
tion—Mexican Capitalists Who Op
pose Carranza Indirectly Accused by
Washington Officials.
Washington, Oct. 27.—War and state
department officials today refused to
disclose the source of Information on
which'Secretary Baker last night Is
sued a statement charging that a ban
dit attack on American troops in Mex
ico or on American border towns had
been planned to discredit the adminis
tration's Mexican policy. They declared
the channel of Information was so val
uable that nothing would be given out
that might Injure its usefulness.
Secretaries Baker and Lahslng de
clared today that no political influence
has led to the statement.
"The obviously appropriate comment
of the secretary of state," Secretary
Baker said, referring- *o the explana
tion by Secretary Lansing last night
that no Amecicaa/was implicated and
that any idea to prevent the* carrying
out of the plans had prompted Secre
tary's Baker's statement, "precludes
that any such construction would be
put on my statement.. The 'statement
was without political purpose and
ought.to be without political effect"
Blames Mexican Interesta.
Secretary Baker declared it "absurd"
to suppose his statement-was Intended
to Imply that any political interest In
the United States desired anything but
peace on the border. Asked j,ust what
Interests he charged were behind the
movement he dictated this statement:
"The Mexicans who oppose the de
facto government in .Mexico would, of
course, be glad to complicate relation*
between the United States and Mexico,
and our information is that they1 think
this an appropriate time to do so. The
statement made last night by tl^e de
partment ought to discourage any ad
venture on their part in that direction.
Everybody know« that many Mexicans
in this country are constantly agitating
against the de tacto government
"The only rfo&»ible. suggestion of a
political purpose (in the war depart
ment statement)" is to "prevent people
3n Mexico from creating a disturbance)
of a political character in furtherance
of their own designs."
Htfpit to Checkmate Plot.
Part of the information, the secre
tary said, reached him yesterday aft
ernoon, sooiv-after he left to deliver a
campaign speech in West Virginia. Mr.
Baker .took his advie'eg up with Sec
retary Lansing and the latter advised
there be ho delay in making public the
Information.
Secretary Lansing views the Infor
mation as showing a dangerous situ
ation along the border. Publication
of the fact that the government has
taken steps to checkmate such a move
ment, he believes goe» far ,toward pre
venting an attack either upon a bor
der town or on General Pershing's
forces.
Secretary Baker refused to say
whether orders have been given Gen
eral Pershing to me£t an attack. He
gave the Impression that-Generals Per.
shlng and Funston might-have been di
rected to take step* of a retaliatory
nature should there be any attack on
their forces.
"I have nothing to say on "that sub
ject," was his .only response to every
question in regard to orders sent to the
border.
Lansing Accuses Mexicans.
Later Mr. Lansing authorized this
statement:
"I was quite correctly quoted In the
statement that Secretary Baker's state
ment was not inspired by any political
conditions. Nor does it infer that any
Americans are concerned In the plot.
There are many Mexican refugees in
this country who are inimical to the
president's policy who might consider
the present time as one ripe for the
furtherance of their projects. The silver
which is known to have gone from the
country to Mexican bandits was not
necessariry from Americans. Indeed, I
can not believe any American citizen is
so heartless as to take any political
step which would result in the loss
of American lives/*
Mr. Baker's Statsmsnt.
The statement follows:
"The war department has received
definite information, confirmed from
other sourcos, that enemies of the ad
ministration's policy toward Mexico, in
co-operation with Villa or other ban
dits in Mexico, have arranged a spec
tacular attack to be made either upon
some part' of the American forces or
upon some American community on
the border between njw and the date
of the election
for
the purpose of turn­
ing the tide of sentiment against the
policy which the administration has
adopted for the protection of, the
border.
Paid in Silvar GointSS&timii'rt
"It Is significant in this connection
that both tlft state and war depart
ments were advised that the banMt
forces operating at the present time in
Mexico are being paid in silver coin.
"Full particulars have, been trans
mitted to General Funston ^and Gen
eral Pershing. All American forces
are therefore forewarned and In readi
ness. /or such. a$ attack.^
Mexicans Responsible.
From other sources it was Ifeampd
that'information concerning & plot had
been received through agents of t}ie
department of Justice, fctate- depart
ment representatives on th« border.
MARSHALLTOWN, IOWA, FRIDAY, OCTOBER 27, ,19,16
and also thru some other channel,
which hail not been disclosed!.
It is understood' that no military re-'
ports from'the border have mentioned
the subject, The statement bears out
this, Dedicating that Generals Pershing
and Funston received their first warn
ing thru advices sent by the war de
partment.
It is stated on reliable authority aJso
that none of the evidence at ,hand m
volves Americans, and that Mexican
interests in the United States are be
lieved to be direcfly responsible for the
conspiracy with the bandits.
Situation Held Serious.
Vlllistiis' activity near Chin mhun
l)ad the effect of convicting officials
here that no thought should be given
soon to removal: of guardsmen from
border patrol daty or withdrawal of
General Pershing's column from
Mexico.
Fear was felt that if Villa should
succeed In his apparent movement to
capture Chihuahua he might find it
easy to get control later of nearly all
northern Mexico. The entire Mexican
situation was regarded as more seri
ous than for many months.
CARRANZA DENIES REPORTS.
Claims Neither Chihuahua City Nor
'Mexico City. Is Menaced.
New York, Oct 27.—The following
telegram from General Carransa dated
Mexico City Oct. 27, 2:30 a. m., was
made public today Juan'T. Burns,
Mexican consul general at New York:
''Absolutely false that bandit Villa Is
besieging -the city of Chihuahua or
that Zaipata menaces the tranquility of

vention at Queretaro. All military op
erations have 'been successful and the
situation is improving' dally."
Villa Threatens Railroad.
San Antonio,. Tex., Oct. 27.—Villa Is
reported to be planning a movement on
Santa Rosalio to-cut the railroad line
It was ann-ounced that all border
commands have been instructed to
keep a careful watch on the situation,
as a result of word from Secretary Ba
ker regarding discovery of a .plot for
Mexican forces to attack the border or
the American forces in Mexico before
election time.
Officials ot the department of justice
also have beert\ asked to ^report any
suspicious developments in border
conditions.

request' by. Andres Garcia, inspector
general of consulates, asking for defin

In the message General Trevino de
nied there had been any fighting at
Fresno, eight miles from Chihuahua
City, and added that Villa had been
forced to abando^ his base at Santa
Ysabel and had been forced to go south
toward Satevo. It was stated early en
gagements were expected between the
Carranza forces and those of Villa.
General Trevino characterized the re
port that government officials had been
warned to leave Chihuahua City was
"absurd."
MORE BRITISH GOLD
SENT TO NEW YORK
Fifteen Millions From Canada Da
posited at Assay Office, Bringing Da
poait For Security, For the Year, Up
to $450,000,000.
New York, Oct. 27.—Gold amounting
to $15,000,000 from Canada was de
posited at the assay office today by J.
P. Morgan & Co., acting as fiscal and
commercial agents of the British gov
ernment. This makes a total of $450,
000,000 received thu9( far this year,
chietly by way of Canada and prac
tically all for account of British and
allied Interests.
It is believed that the flotation, next
.week of the new $300,0.00,000 British
loan will bring a temporary halt In the
Import of the metal. The banking in
terests ar^ opposed to a further Inflow
of gold on the ground that it may be
provocative of inflation.

Farnham, Quebec, Oct. 27.—The ruins

Several small fires during the i.lght

HUGHES OUTLINES PRINCIPLES
Tells of Policies by Which He Will be
Ruled if Elected.
Boston, Oct. 27. —"Charles Evans
Hughes, speaking here last night, out
lined explicitly the policies he pro
poses to pursue if elected president
Following on his declaration of yester
day that he will he elected, his state
ment attracted much attention. These
are the principles by which Mr.
Hughes said his administration would
be guided:
An executive responsible to the
whole nation.
A cabinet chosep from our ablest
men.
A foreign policy that stands courte
ously but firmly and consistently for
American rights.
A flag that protects the American
citisen in his lawful rights, wherever
his legitimate bdsihess may take him.
A" preparation for trade co-operation
which shall protect all groups of Amer
ican workmen.
A government supervision of busi
ness which, while preventing abuses,
will act on the assumption that the av
erage business man is honest.
A domestic policy which looks to In
dustrial peace and co-operation, not to
industrial war.
Hia Presidential Polioy.
"No man cartel! In ndvnnce," Mr.
Hughes said, 'Vhat unexpected de
mands the next four years may pre
sent, but one whose conception of a
president's duty rests upon funda
mental principles can describe with
sincerity how the problenis of adminis
tration would bo approached and In
what spirit they would be solved.
"I propose, first of all, to start right
The president is primarily the execu
tive. It Is his supreme duty to attend
to the business of the nation, to safe
guard its Interests, to anticipate and
understand its needs, to enforce Its
laws. The first act of a president who
takes this view of his duties is to call
about him the ablest cabinet the coun
try can furnish,' the most competent
administrative heads of the vast de
partments of the nation's affairs men
who can deal with the tremendous in
ternational and domestic problems
which will confront us in the next
four years.
The Wilson Cabinet.
"My conception of the presidency is
radically different from that which
seenis'to have governed the action of
the present administration. At the

their amiable qualities, were absolute
