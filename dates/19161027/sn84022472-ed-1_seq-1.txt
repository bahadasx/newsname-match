AMERICAN CHAIN CO.
lOW IN CONTROL OF
WORLD'S PRODUCTION
Great Merger, of Industries
Puts Bridgeport Corpora:
. tion in Control of Many
. Big Manufactories One
Plant to Supply Ford
Company With Big Order.
Walter B. Lashar Confirms
V Story of Amalgamation of
- Two Snydicates Which
i Gives to Bridgeport Dom
. inating Place in Manufac
ture of All Sorts of Chains
The American Chain Co. of this
city, of which Walter B. Lashar, of
this city, is treasurer and the chief
owner, now dominate the entire
chain industry of America. '
. Chains of all sorts, ranging from
the - delicate watch chains with tiny
links, to- ponderous anchor " chains
with links that weigh nearly one hun
dred posnds, all come within the
scope of tbe,production of. the Bridge
port corporation, with its local and
out of town plants.
. details of c the amalgamation of
ichain manufactories are not made
pubfloTMcefli In a general way. But
- j Mr. Lashar today confirmed the state-
tnent that the American- Chain Com-
Lpany his,. tkeh er the Standard
Chain Company's' plants. These in
clude: !
. One at Braddock, Penn. .
-One at St. Mary's, O.
One- at Marion. Indiana.
' ' Two at Columbus, O., including roll
ing mill and chain plant
- The Braddock, Penn., plant. Is a
'. 'huge rolling mill as well as a chain
(manufactory.
.Though it is believed in industrial
, circles today that the purchase has
been made outright, Mr. Lashar does
' not ; reveal the approximate purchase
- i price rumored to be in the millions.
I The acquisition will increase the
pay-roll of the American Chain com
pany by 6,000 men and will mean, an
increased output of chain estimated
at this time to be 75,000 tons annually.
Tills volume is an enormous amount
of chain when it Is considered 'the
present output of the American Chain
company is something like 60,000 tons.
annually, much of which is small
watch and household link- chain.
The manufacture of tire chains by
which the local plant and to a,cer
v tain extent the American Chain com
pany, have achieved prestige now be
comes a minor factor in the general
chain business which will .be devel
oped under Mr. Lashar and his asso
ciates' efforts. In the Columbus plant
has been acquired the largest chain
testing machine in the world and it
is likely that hereafter the American
Chain company will furnish the
'United States gvernment with all its
navy chain, and will take an active
part in the maritime chain supply of
the world, following the European
-war. '
- At the present time one of the new
ly acquired plants will be devoted to
the production of castings for the
Ford car, contracts for over one mil
lion dollars having been taken over.
The American Chain company with
Its newly acquired property will have
It factories in all, including the three
plants at "Tork, Penn., two 'of which
have recently been built. Outside of
the United States' there is one fac-
- tory at London, England, now devoted
.to manufacturing . war supplies and
another at Niagara Falls, Ontario.
With a factory addition in Bridge
port, partially finished which will
give an additional floor space of be
tween 76,000 and 100,000 square feet.
- 3Ir. Lashar said today that the pres
ent combination of Industry would in
all. probability greatly increase the
business of the Bridgeport plant.

OF HIS CRIME
j
Arms Company Guard Tells
Police He was Accosted by
Blood-Reeking Fugitive.
INQUIRED DIRECTION
TO TROLLEY TRACKS
Clothes Were Covered With
Burrs Such as Abound in
South End Lot.
The murderer of Michael Torko, his
clothing soaked with fresh blood, wild
eyed disheveled and greatly agitated
was seen hurrying from the field at
Railroad and South avenue, the scene
of his revolting crime, at 1:15 last Sun
day morning, the l approximate hour
that Torko met Ms death.
He stopped and talked with Thomas
Prothro, an honorably discharged ex
soldler, now"empkyed at the vming
ton Arms Co., as a guard, for a periea
of nearly five minutes, the "slasher"
inquiring directions as to bis way and
the running of street cars.
That this man is the murderer of
Michael Torko the police have ,not the
slightest doubt. . Even to the broad
toed shoes, the imprint of which he
left in the blood stained grass, as he
stood surveying the mutilated remains
of his victim the police have a most
complete description of him. , '
Burrs which abound In the Held
where- Torko was .killed and which
one cannot fall to. catch on his cloth
ing, passing through a rank growth in
the lot dotted the clothing of the mur
derer. When told by Prothro that to
reach Main street, his stated destina
tion, he could walk up to State street
and get a trolley car, the criminal sig
nificantly remarked in fair spoken
English, "No, I guess I'm too dirty."
Prothro toad been, visiting , friends
Saturday night and was walking home.
He reached Park avenue and Prospect
sereet at 1:15 Sunday morning, when a
man greatly agitated approached him
from Park and Black Rock avenues,
standing in front . of Colonel Heft's
house, when first seen. He inquired
of the Remington guard the direction
to Main street.
While talking with the murderer,
Prothro noted his alarmed mental
state, bis disheveled appearance, and
kept his eye closely on the right arm
of his questioner, noticing that he kept
the hand covered In his overcoat
pocket, while the arm held a bundle,
which Prothro believes contained un
derwear, hugged . to his side.
In line with his employment as a
guard at the arms plant, Prothso in
stinctively scrutinized the man care
fully by the aid of the electric street
light at this point. It was then noted
that the left side of a medium length
overcoat, from the pocket -down to the
bottom was literally soaked with blood
and theleft leg of his trousers smeared
With the same substance.
"I told Mm," said Prothro In an in
terview with The Farmer reporter,
"when he asked the way to Main
street to walk up two blocks to State
street, and take a trolley car. He re
plied, 'Oh, I guess I'm too dirty.
"He started to walk through Pros
pect street, and stopped as I Informed
him he could go over this way to
Broad street and walk one block south,
then go straight -.ahead one. block -to
Main street. He left me following that
direction. V
, "The man was a foreigner, al
though he spoke fair English. He
was full faced, between 30 and 32
years of age, abont 5 feet 7 or 8
inches in height and weighed about
160 or 165 pounds. He wore a light
grey overcoat and the left side from
the pocket nearly to the bottom was
full of blood. His trousers were also
covered with blood on the left leg.
He was . greatly excited, keeping his
right hand in his pocket, while the
other encircled a bundle which ap
peared to be underclothing. I be
lieve his suit was of the same color,
grey, as his overcoat, and he wore
a dark . uncrushed felt hat.
"I went to the lot where the body
was found, Monday afternoon, hav
ing read the story of the murder in
the1 newspapers and I now distinctly
remember seeing many' of the burrs
on this man's clothes, the night that
I met him; the same burrs that were
found in the lot back of the bill
board where the body was discover
ed. "I am positive about these details
and I could easily identify this man

at the corner of Atlantic and. Rennell
streets and the expenditure of a quar
ter of. a million dollars in the imme
diate improvement of the Lashar
Henkel property In Connecticut ave
nue under the Ellen Wilson system.
It was decided to abandon work on'
the. Honey Spot road property near
the Bridgeport line in Fairfield until

ON SOURCES OF
INTRIGUE STORY
Publication of Knowledge
of Border Plot May Halt "
Any Outbreak.
CARRANZA'S FOES
ARE BEHIND PLAN
No Americans Involved,
Statements From Depart
ments Assert.
Washington, Oct. 27 War and
state departments refused today to
disclose the source or specific nature
of the information on which Secre
tary Baker' last night issued a state
ment charging that a bandit attack
on American troops in Mexico or en
the American border towns has been
planned to discredit the government's
Mexican policy. They said the chan
nel of information through which the
report came was so valuable that
nothing would be given out that
might injure its usefulness.
Both Secretary Lansing and Secre
tary Baker today laid stress upon the
statement that no consideration of
domestic politics led to the issue of
the announcement that such a plot
had been discovered. .
Secretary Baker declared It . was
"absurd" to suppose that his state
ment had been Intended to imply that
any political interest in the United
States desired anything other ' than
peace on the border.
"Such a thing could not be," he
said.
Asked just what interests he charg
ed were behind the movement. Sec
retary Baker dictated this statement:
'The Mexicans who oppose the de
facto government in Mexico would,
of course, be glad to complicate rela
tions between the United States and
Mexico and our information is that
they think this an appropriate time
to do so. The statement made last
night by the department ought to dis
courage any adventure on their part
in that direction.
"Everybody knows that many Mex
icans in this country are constantly
agitating against the de facto gov
ernment. Any sympathy there may
be on the American side of the bor
der with the movement is wholly
from this source.
, "The only possible suggestion of
a political purpose, (in the war de
partment's statement) is to prevent
people in Mexico from creating a dis
turbance of a political character In
furtherance of their own design."
Later Secretary Lansing Issued the
following statement:
It was quite correctly reported last
night in the statement that Secretary
Baker's announcement was inspired by
absolutely no political considerations
as to this country. Nor does it mean
to infer that Americans of any sort
are involved in the plot. There are
many ' Mexican refugees In this coun
try who are inimical to the President's
Mexican policy who would doubtless
consider the present time as ripe for
the furtherance of their projects. The
silver which is known to have gone
from this country to Mextean bandits
was not necessarily from Americans.
Indeed, I cannot conceive that there is
any American! citizen who Is so heart
less, so entirely cruel, so wanton as to
take a political step that would lnvolv
American Uvea.
"The warning was given simply to
protect American lives' and property
and I have every- hope it will be effec
tive.
