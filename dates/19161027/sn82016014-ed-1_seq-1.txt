members of the party on the Hughes
special, which invaded Kansas today.
The women, who had been roasted and
toasted to a frazzle in the big parade
up Kansas avenue, preceding the audi
torium meeting, by signs and cheers
for Wilson from a hundred Bourbon
women in automobiles, got sweet re
venge in the auditorium.
The Democrat women who joined
the parade, with flying banners, at
the Rock Island station marched into
tho balcony of the auditorium and
faced the speakers on the platform.
Their banners were placed in a con
spicuous piece and could be read eas
ily from tne stage. The speakers an
swered most of the questions asked on
the banners and each retort drew
round after round of applause. Not
a word in response was uttered by
any of the Bourbons in the gallery
not until Charles H. Sessions, chair
man of the Republican state commit
tee, took advantage of the opportun
ity to go after the Democrats on their
state stand on prohibition and suf
frage. "If by any chance Kansas should go
Democratic," shouted Sessions, "the
brewers will take advantage of the
victory to proclaim thruout the nation
that Kansas women have repudiated
prohibition."
Whitney Takes It Vp.
"Look here," cried F. E. Whitney,
Democrat county chairman, from the
gallery. "Can't you raise anything but
dead issues?"
"Throw him out,' some one shouted.
' "Shut up," cried another.
The audience cheered and clapped
its hands. Sessions never answered
Whitney and immediately introduced
Miss Elizabeth Freeman of New York
as the next speaker.
"I don't know what are dead issues
in your state," said Miss Freeman,
"but woman's suffrage and the Demo
crat Ftand on it are not dead in the
country."
Again the audience went wild.
Every retort by the speakers, six in
number, to the signs on the Democrat
banners drew like applause. A good
looking press agent held a stop watch
on each speaker and those near the
front could hear her say in an under
tone, "One minute more," "two min
utes more" and "three minutes more.
The opposition in the gallery drew
the entire attention of those fitting on
the platform. Their eyes remained
glued to the gallery and every shot of
the speaker caused a smile to light the
features of the women from the east,
north, south and west who are tour
ing the country in a special train for
Charles Evans Hughes.
Mrs. Elliott Speaks First.
Mrs. Maud Howe Elliott of New
port, R. I., author and lecturer and a
daughter of Julia Ward Howe, was the
first speaker. Mrs. Elliott stated that
she would speak of the past and its
traditions which should cause Kansas
to go for Hughes and leave the present
to the younger speakers.

BRING A DEMOCRAT NOW
College Will Even Up With
Students Right Soon.
Co-Ed Asked a Question and
Was Promptly Ignored.
While the students and faculty sat
amazed Miss Rheata Childa Doors,
specifically requested by the college
authorities not to make a campaign
talk but to tell of her industrial and
literary experiences, opened fire upon
the Democrats from the college
chapel as a part of the Hughes Topeka
campaign today. College authorities
are somewhat indignant over the
bringing of politics into her chapel
talk. "We had asked that Miss Doors
bring some message carrying special
inspiration and helpfulness to our
young men and young women," Prof.
E. C. Wheeler, principal of Washburn
academy said today. "We had not
expected her to give us a campaign
talk. And in my conversation with
Mrs. W. A. Johnston that was the
understanding reached.
"But," he added, "Washburn college
students will have a chance to hear
the other side of the matter soon."
Both Miss Door and Mrs. Noble
Prentis, who also spoke, were given a
good round of applause by Washburn
students. But when the students had
collected outside a good number of
Wilson "yellin' bees" were organized
ind to the "rah for Wilson" the auto
carrying Miss Door and Mrs. Prentis
moved away.
Before her machine had left tho,
Mfss Flora Harrington, editor of the
Washburn Review, stepped to the run-
' ning board of the machine and pro
pounded How will you gain woman s
suffrage when the Republican plat
form does not declare for woman suf
frage?" Written by Reactionaries.
"Oh," responded Miss Door, "of
course the platform was written by the
reactionaries."
Further questions were forestalled
by Mrs. Noble Prentis's indignantly
requesting the driver to "go ahead."
In her taik Miss Door said: "It is
much easier to repeat a slogan than to
think. It is much easier to say that
'Wilson kept us out of war' than to
think what that means. At the audi
torium this morning hundreds of Wil
son supporters sincere people, I sup
pose, waved their pictures of the pres
ident without saying a word. They re-

minded me of the image sellers in the
temple of Ephesus who tried to drown
out the Apostle Paul by shouting mo
notonously, 'Great is Diana of Ephe
sus.' Thus are the people who cry the
slogans, 'You are for war, we are for
Wilson' or 'Wilson kept us out of
war.'
"Did Wilson keep Holland or Switz
erland out of war? No. they kept out
of war for they were prepared against
insult. Today Holland has trenches
dug and fortifications ready to resent
any such insult as the United States
has suffered."
To Hear Other Side.
Miss Door finished her talk by
promising that if Hughes were elected,
factory conditions for women would
be ameliorated and saying that if Wil
son were elected she would never dare
to cross the Atlantic again and face
her friends in Europe.
Mrs. Noble Prentis wound up
Washburn's first political meeting by
telling the students: "Don't listen to
what the other side has to say. The
Democrats are desperate. AH those
of you who have votes or can influence
voters do so on November 7. Wash
burn students are too nice fine young
people to vote the Democrat ticket."
Petitions are being circulated among
Washburn students asking that a
Democrat speaker be allowed to pre
sent the other side of the argument
before the election. College authori
ties are in favor of such a plan, now
that the political ball has been start
ed rolling at Washburn by the Hughes
Alliance speakers.

ing.
The parade of the women of the

o'clock this morning was well patron
ized. It was led by the Knights and

few persons of leisure stood on the
curbing to watch the procession.
Then Came the Sensation
Then came the surprise of the day.
Automobile after automobile, crowd
ed with women, many of them cheer
ing, all bearing big posters in support
cf Woodrow Wilson, jammed the
streets. Old fashioned box banners
asking questions of the Hughes sup
porters were carried by the Bourbon
nesses. Pictures of President Wilson
appeared on and about every automo
bile. And the customary reserved and
excuse-me applause that is character
istic of Topeka was favorable to the
head of the White House.
Switch Crew's Approval.
When the Wilsonettes appeared
near the Rock Island station in for
mation a switch engine with crew was
in operation behind the Chesterfield
hotel. The engineer, apparently an
admirer of the Adamson law, applied
the brakes, turned off the steam and
with his engine and switching crew
collected on top of a box car and
waved their caps in cheers for Presi
dent Wilson
With this encouragement the Wil
son women began their trip up Kansas
avenue behind the Hughes hired band.
100 Motor Cars.
In the parade there were 100 auto
mobiles. Probably 450 women occu
pied seats in these cars. Of this num
ber, the Democrats operated thirty
motor cars and demonstrated with 150
women.
The parade today was the culmina
tion of several days of frantic work on
the part of the Republican ard Demo
cratic women of the city. Solicitations
for automobiles and the occupants
thereof were at fever heat thruout the
week. The Democratic cohorts were
especially energetic in their activities
thru the Pocahontas and Wilson clubs.
The bitter feeling .between the wo
men was not evident during the pa
rade. Bach was busily engaged in at
tending to her own knitting and at
tempting to stir up some sort of an
outburst from the suspicious and cold
ly interested Kansas avenue crowds.
But when the women reached the
auditorium well, that's another story.

TAME DOWN TREASON .CHARGE

Didn't Mean Americans Are

Again IT. S. Threatens to Use
Force if De Factos Fail.
Washington, Oct. 27. Secretary of
War Baker announced today that he
may have another statement to make
later on his charge that a plot exists
to produce armed conflict between the
United States and Mexico. Adminis
tration officials indicated today they
considered Baker's statement was in
tended to be a warning to the Mexican
government and a guarantee of the
American government's good faith.
The administration expects the Car
ranza government to take final and
effective measures for the suppres
sion of Mexican banditry.
Secretary Baker returned today
from Martinsburg, W. Va., where he
spoke last night.
The belief of other administration
leaders as well as Baker's own was
expressed in the startling statement of
last night. The administration by
making public its knowledge of a
danger seriously threatening the rela
tions between this government and
the Carranza government expects Car
ranza to fully realize this govern
ment's unselfish purpose and. In con
sequence, hopes for more active co
operation between the military forces
of the two countries for common ac
tion against the Mexican bandits.
Force in Mexico by 17. S.
There is reason to believe that
should the Carranza government
ignore the opportunity presented and
fail to bring about a better condition
in Mexico the American government
will seriously consider independent ac
tion toward that end.
Baker's statement Is also expected
to have an important effect in check

American siae or the border. While

The Grey nuns who conducted the

Farnham was under police guard dur

Storm in Rumania Cabinet.
Berlin, Oct. 27. Fleeing Russo-Ru-manian
forces are evacuating practi
cally all Dobrudja said an official
statement from the Bulgarian war of
fice today.
"On the whole front the enemy is
retreating precipitately toward Tulcea,
Braila and Harsova, pursued by our
forces," said the statement issued at
Sofia.
"Wednesday's captures included
fifteen officers. 771 men and fifteen
machine guns."
Tulcea lies seventy miles north of
Constanza, on the southern arm of
the Danube and a few miles from the
Russian frontier. Braila lies about
seventy miles north of Cernavoda on
the Danube, and Harsova about twen-.
ty-five miles northwest of Cernavoda
on the Danube.
King Ferdinand dispatched personal
appeals to the rulers of allied nations
to save Rumania from disaster after
the fall of Constanza, according to
Budapest dispatches.
Rumania Generals Criticized.
The messages were sent following a
stormy session of the Rumanian cab
inet. Rumanian military leaders were
said to have been harshly criticized
by several of the ministers but sup
ported by the king, who declared the
Rumanian defeat was due to the fact
that Russia had failed to supply the
artillery and munitions she had prom
ised. German military men expect an
early demonstration by the allies,
probably on the Italian and Macedon
ian fronts, in response to King Ferd
inand's appeal.
Becaut-e the allied armies lack suf
ficient munitions for great offensives
on these fronts, the attacks are ex
pected to be short-lived and directed
largely for the purpose of encourag
ing the disheartened Rumanians.
RAINCOAT AND PAJAMA

Governor Hughes left Boston today
for a two day campaign in New York
state. The first speech on his day's

"MARRY ANY ONE PICKED OUT"
Girl Doesn't Object to Some
Sort of Ceremony.
"Whose Business Is Itl" Is
Asked "Mine," Says Judge.
If William Woods wants to "be a
good sport" and wed 16-year-old Mary
Adams before she becomes a mother,
the Adams family can't see what pos
sible objection Hugh MacFarland. pro
bate judge, can have. They fail to
see where he gets any chips in the
game
Thursday, after Judge MacFarland
had declined to issue a license to the
mysterious Woods, granting permis
sion to him to marry the unfortunate
Adams girl, members of the Adams
family called upon Judge MacFarland
and demanded to know why.
"If Woods wants to marry her,
whose business it it?" they demanded.
"Just for the present," said Judge
MacFarland, "I am making it my bus
iness. I do not think Woods is re
sponsible for the girl's condition; in
fact there is nothing to indicate that
he is. If she marries him that will
end the case. If she doesn't I think
there will be some developments."
The Adamses went away disgusted
with public officials. The Adamses
and Reads are all disgusted with pub
lic officials. After Papa Adams and
Papa Read kidnaped sixteen-year-old
Eugene Read Monday night and herd
ed him over to a justice court in Oak
land; after they had procured a mar
riage license authorizing Young Eu
gene to wed young Mary Adams, Jus
tice J. P. Williams balked. He re
fused to perform the ceremony when
the boy who was expected to pose as
the bridegroom declared it would take
more money than there is in Topeka
to make him stand up with the willing
bride.
Balked Again.
Then when Woods put in his ap
pearance and offered to straighten
everything up by marrying the girl
Judge MacFarland put his foot down
and headed off another ceremony.
Apparently it makes no difference
whether the man is willing or not
something always bobs up to prevent
the ceremony.
Eugene Read declared that his
father. Repps Read who tried to force
him to marry the girl, is responsible
for her condition. The girl does not
say that. Repps Read is married to
Mary Adams's sister, Hattie. They
have a child perhaps a year old. She
has been at the court house trying '
to head off any proceedings against ;
her husband.
"They are trying to send my hus- j
band to the penitentiary and leave me
alone with this little baby," she wailed.
It was the same woman who, Eu
gene Read said, charged his father,
her husband, with being responsible
for Mary Adams's condition.
Waits on County Attorney.
"This is the most complicated case
I have ever seen," said Judge Mac
Farland. "I don't know what will
I grow out of it. As a matter of fact
it does not come under my department
j but because the county attorney's
j force was busy and because the mar
i riage license was issued here, I have
: been making a sort of an investigation.
I believe there will be developments
when the case brought by Eugene
Read aealnst his father, charging as
sault and battery, is tried. Both fam
lies will be in court then and certainly
something will come out of it."

"I'd like to know how he gets in on
the case," said Judge MacFarland. "He

The girl appears to be willing to marry
