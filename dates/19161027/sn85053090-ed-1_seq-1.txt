Government Rifle Club
All sportsmen interested in rifle
shooting are invited to n~e?t at
S. J. Emswiler's office on Mon
day evening, Oct. 30, at 7:30 for
the purpose of organizing a Gov
ernment rifle club. The purpose
of the clnb is the promotion of
rifle and pistol practice. Uncle
Sam furnishes the rifles and am
munition as well as mndals i n
those whose skill entitles them to
the same. No obligations for
military service will be incurred
by membership in the club ar.d
the running expenses are so low
that the membership fees are
within the means of all. A splen
did range has been found near
town over which almost any dis
tance desired may be had. Al
though the government furnishes
rifles, club members who wish to
own their own guns may pur
chase them at $5.00 each. A sim
ilar club is in operation at Plev
na with which the Ekalaka club
can arrange shoots. All those in
terested, whether they desire to
take an active part or not should
help boost the movement as the
amount of ammunition furniài e
is based on the number of mem
bers. Also, as members cannot
be admitted except at steied
times, those who wish to join
should get in now.
