when it comes to the fulfillment of 13 I ijH
the promise of political reforms. jj HH
In the debate on the subject in the ja ;H

view that only anamalous conditions I

GOLD FLOWING I
IN FROM CANADA I
New York, Oct 27. Gold amount
ing to $15,000,000 from Canada was
deposited at the assay office today by fl
J. P. Morgan & Co., acting as fiscal fl
and commercial agents of the British fl
government. This makes a total of
$450,000,000 received thus far this fl
year, chiefly by way of Canada and
practically all on account of British
and allied interests.
It Is believed that the flotation next
week of the new ?300,000,000 loan will H
bring a temporary halt to further im- 1
ports of the metal. This is in ac- j
cordance with the views of conserva- ,
tlve American banking interests, '
which are opposed to a further in

may be provocative of inflation. 1
