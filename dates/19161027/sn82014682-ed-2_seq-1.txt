Emphatic Statement By City
- Attorney .
J NO DELAY NECESSARY,
HE SAYS IN STATEMENT
"If, By November 27, 1916,
', the Rapid Transit Has Not
Moved Its Track, the Board
of Supervisors and the Sup
erintendent of. Public Works
Will" V
"Betrayal of the city's rights" will
be the result If the supervisors pass
, a resolution appropriating money to
help pay the expenses of the Rapid
Transit Company n relocating its
tracks on Kalakana avenue, according
to the emphatic opinion of the. city
attorney's office, and that office Is
determined to stand by its guns. f
. - City Attorney Brown backs up his
- assistants, . Deputies Cristy and Car
den, in the protest they have already
made against the supervisors' pasring
such a resolution. In a. comprehen
sive statement to the Star-Bulletin
today the' city "attorney declares not
only that the supervisors cannot right
fully nass the proposed resolution, but
that there is no necessity for delay if
the appjpprl.itoi is not made, lie also
charges that'the Rapid Transit ants
some act by the city which will tie
its (the city's) hands for all time."
His statement. In' the form of a let
ter to the editor, is as follows:
"Honolulu. October 27, 1916.
The Editor of the Star-Bulletin.' Ho
nolulu." "
"Dear Sir: In an editorial in the
8arfluIle-Ui-f October 2-191.-yh'f
us editor of the paper, 'state that you
. and the public want to know what is
blocking progress, ' on "Kalakaua ave
nue. .
"As city and county attorney I take
pleasure in explaining the precise
stand of this office and the reasons
t therefor, and I request that you give
the same amount of publicity to this
communication as has been given in
reporting the, attitude of the Rapid
Transit Company.
"It is conceded that public interests
demand the raovfng of the Rapid Tran
Bit tracks to the center of Kalakaua
avenue to confornr to the contemplat
ed improvement of that avenue by the
city. The permanent reconstruction
of Kalakaua avenue Is only the be-'
Ainning of. similar reeonstructlon of
main thoroughfares ..throughout the
city; As on Kalakaua avenue . the
tracks of the Rapid Transit Comnnny
are on the side of the street, on King
street, throughout, KalmukI and : at
Palama, shutting off. entirely . each
property owner on that side of the
street from reasonable access to the
street. Justice to the property own
era demands that, the reconstruction
.. of these highways shall include relo
cation of the Rapid Transit's tracks.
Justice to the company may require
that ' it should not be compelled -o
move its tracks on any street until
such street is being rebuilt. Kalakaua
-avenue is now in the process of re
construction. If the city nays one
, nickel of the cost of such relocation
' on Kalakaua arcane it will be tied up
to a contribution in every other rase.
If, as an official act. the board of su
pervisors in any way touches the
ir.000 collected by public subscription,
' then the act, by the board s an an
by the city. Such an act would aaain
aet a precedent for contribution. For,
the Rapid Transit Company can than
say, 'We don't care where the city
got the money, the city gave it to us.'
""The statement has been made that
my office is holding up the actual
work on Kalakaua avenue. The law
requires,, . first, that the assessment
ordinance shall be enacted. This has
. been rushed by this office. It should
be law by October 31., . The contract
or can then be ordered by the ioard
to sign his contract and file Ms bond.
As soon as the board of supervisor?
has accepted the contractor's houd
the board can then order the contract
or' to commence the whole job forthwith.-
'
"Wednesday and Thursday of this
- week the superintendent of public
works" and the Public Utilities Com
mission ordered the Rapid Transit to
move its track to the middle, of "Kala
kaua avenue within 30 days. If the
Rauid Transit Company does
not
move wiuun uaj3, ii mru uctumro
the duty of the attorney-general to
forfeit the company's charter.
"That does not mean delay. The
charter of the company provides that
' in this sltnation the government can
move the tracks of the company and
then sue the company for the money.
Ia other words, work on Kalakaua ave
nue is not .going to be held up by
legal procedure. If, by the 27th day
of November, 1916, the Rapid Transit
has not moved tits track, the board
of supervisors and the superintendent
of public works wilLv

Shippers to Benefit When
Supplement is Issued
As a result of hearings which the
public utilities commission has been
conducting concerning rates charged
by the Inter-Island on cattle shipped
from island ports to Honolulu, the
company is preparing, a supplement
to tariif . Xo. 2, which went into ef
fect September 1 and which caused
vigorous protests from cattle shippers
because of the higher rates charged.
Vice-President J. L. McLean of the
Inter-Island today gave the Star-Bulletin
details; ot several reductions to
be made in' the supplement; reduc
tions which, the company is irfakjng
because It realizes there are certain
ports where easier cattle shipping con
ditions warrant lowering the rates.
The recent new tariff made a uniform
increase effective, to which shippers
made . immediate objection, appealing
to the commission to lower rates from
certain ports. v ' i
In Lrief, the supplement to be is
sued as soon as the commission con
cludes Its hearing of the company's
side of the case and the Inter-Island
determines how other rates are work
ing out and if any adjustments are
needed in them, will mean a reduc
tion of 10 per cent from the rate
charged, by tariff No. 2 on live 6tock
for slaughter from all Maui ports to
Honolulu except Kahnlul, where the
reduction will be 12 1-2 per cent On

of it to the extent ot over 10000 tons.
Figures on other plantations or com

amount of 4500 tons and afloat for the!

account of the Sugar Factors Com
pany. To be shipped ; between now
and the middle of November there
will be 732 tons in two vessels and
from November 15 for the; ensuing
three weeks about 3000 tons. This
gives figures of 6900 tons afloat or in
transit. 722 tons for early shipment
and 3000 tons for later shipment by
the Sugar Factors Company, in all
10,732 tons. This will clean up, so

Lord-Young Project Receives
Its Knockout at Meeting of
Commissioners Today
I
That the board of commissioners
of agriculture and forestry has, no
authority to grant right for exclusive
occupation and ; possession, of land
within a forest reservation for a fixed
perod is the gist of, an opinion, filed
today at the meeting of the commis
sioners ty, Attorney-General I.-', M.

Inquiry. has beenNinade of the attor
ney whether or not the commissioners
have power to grant to Ixrd-Young
Engineering Company, Limited, li
cense to use 2.94 acres of land for
a long period of years, the, land fying
'within the .Honolulu watershed for
est reserve m the neighborhood of the
Pali for use la connection with the
building and use of an aerial tram
way.'.' :'. .'.V 7- ;
'T am Informed," says the report,
"that the purpose for which, the use
of the land in question is desired re
quires that the applicant shall have
the exclusive possession and occupa
tion of said land for a period of at
least iO years. If that is so then any
agreement would very likely be con
strued as a le iee and not a license."
The opinion, is written by Deputy
Attorney WllUam lleen, and ap
proved by the attorney-general. " It
goes on to point out 'that the project
which " tfie appIicanT liasT In Tnmd an

quire quite an expenditure of money,
making likely his insistance for an ir
revocable license, ,and that such a li

of these men . are being enenr.:
Increased in size and efficiency.
Secretary of -State Lanslcg aut:

not intended to intimate that An

this particular juncture to- inSi:

Not a Political Move '. .
"It is not a political move, s
Mr. Iansing, "but we believe tSs?
la a most desirable thing to give v. :
information we can to the public, r

the hoie that it may prove suClc!

That the method of assessment 1
