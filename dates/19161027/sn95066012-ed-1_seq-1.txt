5000 GERMANS ABE PRISONERS
Total of French Losses In Drive at
v Verdun Is Less Than Number of
Prisoners Captured.
Paris, Oct. 27. The French are
closing In on Fort Vaux from two
sides and are making steady progress.
The Germans today made a desperate
attempt to regain their lost positions
but were repulsed at all points.
Paris, Oct. 26. Four times today
the Germans came to the attack be
fore Verdun to regain what the
French took from them on Tuesday.
Each attack was a strong one, preced
ed by great bombardment and carried
out by large forces. All were aimed
at Fort Douaumont, and its defenders
threw them all back. Today's attacks
raise the number the Germans have
made since the French' dash to nine.
All have tailed.
The War Office announces tonight
that the number of, prisoners has now
reached 5,000. Last night it was
4,500; on the night of the big attack,
3,500.' Casualty reports show that the
French losses were light, considerably
less than the number of prisoners,
and these reports include the slightly
wounded.
Announcement of the capture of
Vaux fort is expected here at any
time. The French infantry are with
in 500 yards of the fort now. They
have taken much war material, es
peclally German guns massed In the
Ravine of Death.
On the Somme front today the Ger
mans also counter attacked vainly.
They tried to recapture the Stuff
trench this morning, but that strong
position north of the Stuff redoubt,
on the Thiepval ridge, was held firmly
by the British. The British guns
from their new advantageous posi
tions on the ridge worked havoc In
the German ranks.

People of Belgium Much Disturbed
By What They Consider a New
Form of German Cruelty.
London, Oct. 26. The German
reign of tenor in Belgium is taking
its full course, the special correspon
dent of the Times at Amsterdam tele
graphs.' "The Telegraaf," he says, "learns
that lists of burghers designated for
forced labor in pursuance of the new
German order are posted everywhere
in Bel giurn. Many burghers already
have been removed.
"On Monday another 5,000 citizens
were taken lroin Ghent and sent to
Germany. Though a telegram from
the German Wolff Agency reports
there were 1,0(10 spectators at the op
ening of the so-called Flemish univer
sity at Ghent, including teachers and
students, the occasion passed unob
served by the majority of the inhabi
tants because of the impression
caused by the removal of so many
citizens.
"The 5,000 were taken to the rail
road station amid tears and lamenta
tions. Groups of citizens drove the
town in vehicles, singing patriotic
songs and sarcastic verses about the
Germans, but there was no resistance.
"The previous week there were dis
turbances in which burghers were
wounded. The impotence of the peo
ple against the military was then
demonstrated. The Germans have
warned the public in proclamations
against resisting or insulting the
trcops.
"Also the Germans have announced
that all Belgins selected for removal
must procure two pairs of boots and
woolen blankets. At Selzaete 5.000
persons hae received orders to pre
pare for deportation. At Omlenarde
5,000 have been named. At Melle, a
suburb of Ghent, 600 burghers who for
the last six weeks have been engaged
inforced labor at Dixniude have re
turned. They complained of bad food
and treatment and looked pitiful.

San Francisco, Oct. 23. The value

here today by Judge Frank J. Muras

ment for that amount to the parents
of Mary Ruble, 1 yeair old. against

properly at birth and the child Is
blind.
"A pair of baby's eyes are price
less," said Judge Murasky. "No

SAULSBURY SAYS
WEST IS STRONG
Thinks He Will Ca ry Most of the
Western States
WILCOX DECLARES OTHERWISE
He Finds That Labor and Farm Vot
ers Are Now Swiftly Lining Up '
in Support of Hughes.
New York. Oct. 27. Senator Wll
lard Saulsbury of Delaware, chairman
of the Democratic Senatorial cam
paign committee, returned yesterday
from a tour of the Western States
and declared that President Wilson
would carry that part of the coun
try. Not only will Mr. Wilson get the
electrical votes cf nearly all Western
States, predicted the Delaware Sena
tor, but the present Democratic ma
jority in the Senate will be returned
with every prospect of gains.
"There is not one Bure Republican
State west of the Alleghanies," said
the Senator. "I know it is usual for
each side to claim everything in
sight, but aside from all that. I say
honestly that in every Western
State 'I visited I found the sentiment
for Wilson lar greater than for Mr.
Hughes. 1 hav no hesitation what
ever in claiming a majority of t lie
Western States, even including. Utah,
Wyoming and New Mexico. Ten days
ago 1 conoeded Minnesota to the Re
publicans, hut after my last visit 1 ac
tually believe that State will be
found in the Democratic column.
New York, Oct. 27. There wa3 a
vertiable contagion of cheerfulness in
evidence at Republican national head
quarters yesterday. "The swing , is
with us." hairman Wilcox announced
to the reporters, and from the chair
man to the office boys scurrying
everybody fairly radiated optimism.
The reason for all this was the re
ports which are beginning to pour in
from the pivotal States, the States
where the campaign is now on in its
lullest intensity, these reports show
ing that there has plainly been a turn
in the tide. The labor vote, one of the
chief causes of concern in the last
few weeks, is beginning to come
around, according to these indica
tions. Also the Republican managers
believe a defection has begun among
other Wilson supporters.

cellor, informed a neutral newspaper
man recently that since the begin
nlng of the war Germany lias built 225

The German naval authorities, the
Prince Is reported to have added, are
paying more attention to submarines
than to battleships, and Austria-Hungary
is doing likewise.

CRIME TO PEF.L POTATOES
Germans Must Boil 'Em in Their
Jacket3 or Pay Big Fine.
London, Oct. 23. A Reuter de
patch from Copenhagen says:
"Any one discovered peeling pota
toes before boiling them or throwing
away the peelings will be punished by
three months imprisonment or a lino
of 1,500 marke $375), according to an
urgent order issued by the Burgomas
ter of Eckernforde, Schleawig-Hol-stein.
The order Bays the prospects
of obtaining potatoes in the future are
exceedingly small, and that despite
official control It is probable that on
ly a couple of pounds weekly per
head will be obtainable."

PUBLIC WELFARE ASSOCIATION
Held Interesting Meeting Tuesday
. Evening.
At vhe meeting of The Public Wel
fare Association, held at the Library
Tuesday evening, an interested group
of people listen o Miss Pratt's report
of the work of the Recreation Con
gress held in Grand Rapids October
2nd to tith.
The wide range of subjects dis
cussed, the breadth and vision of the
hpeakers, as shown by the report, are
such as to arrest the attention of any
one even passively interested in com
munity work. i
Here is one of the sparks that fell
from the anvil iwhere these earnest
people were hammering out the tools
to give America better citizens:
"What right have we to hold a Rec
reation Congress," asked one speaker,
"when Europe is aflame, when Ameri
ca is struggling through political,
economic, and social changes of great
moment? Is recreation statesman
like? Is it one of the great socializ
ing forces cf the- day? Can play bo
a nation-builder?'
One answer suggested nt the Con
gress was that the recreation move
ment represents the greatest un
worked mine of power in every com
munity. 4,000,000 hours of leisure
every week In Grand Rapids: 3,000,
000 leisure hours weekly in the Unit
ed States. Any great advances in
civiliatlon must be developed out of
this margin, this tdaek, this un
workfd mine. Recreation changes
leisure hours from liabilities to as
sets. Here Is another flash:
"Future war. we hope. will be
fought, not from trenches, but on foot
ball fields." This speaker described
the internationalizing, civilizing in
fluence of American games in China,
India, the Philippines. South .America
and among live million dis-spirited
men in the prison war camps of
Europe.
The Congress discussed athlrtics,
games and play as the best means of
building character and efficiency
whether for peace or for war.
Community centers in the public
schools were emphasized, with their
varied activities, dramatics, games,
civic discussions, music library cen
ters, (lancing, sometimes pool tables,
always clubs, classes and serious
study groups. Milwaukee's wider use
of her school buildings is making that
city famous for something other than
its bottled products.
From Uruguay came the report of
$50,000 appropriated nnnually for phy
sical education and playgrounds un
der the leadership of a trained man
from Kansas.
Anyone who thinks of "play" as
merely child-like, soft, amusing, un
important, would have been sur
prised at the hundreds of powerful,
earnest men and women assembled at
Grand Rapids, intent upon the invigo
ration of American life through
wholesome use of leisure hours to all
tho people.
MOVIE NOTES
Up to-Date News of the Films and
Film Actors
Theatrical circles in Japan are
much concerned by the appearance
of a new foim of entertainment called
the rensageki, which, combining as it
does ail that Is desirable in the mov
ing picture and the best features of
the spoken drama, has driven the Jap
anese David Belascos and Dillinghams
to the point of distraction with its
success. People have deserted the
moving picture theatres while grass
Fprouts between the scats of the vau
deville houses.
The scheme of the rensageki is as
follows: All that part of the story
which can be done by ordinary acting
the dialogues, sobbing farewells,
quarrels, forging the will, what may
be called the connecting narrative
leading up to the thrills is done by
real actors on the stage, and the ex
citements, where the villain is pitched
over a cliff or jumps from an express
train, or the heroine climbs a 500-foot
smokestack, are "canned' with the
aid of the nmera.
It is the extreme pliability of the
rensageki that commends itself to the
managers. In Tokio one famous pic
ture tragedian, Kamora, has been
known to play at four houses during
the evening. One of his great pieces
includes a scene where he dives off a
rock and rescues the heroine. One
sees the heroine struggling In the
water (by films) and then sees Ka
mora poise himself on the rock and
dive. A moment later he appears on
the stage in person all dripping, with
the heroine in his arms.
In four local houses the picture had
been timed so that while the hero was
dripping on the stage far uptown the
picture downtown would just be start
ing. Hy taking a swift taxicab Ka
mora could arrive at three houses and
drip at the proper moment. Every
thing went well at the first and second
houses and Kamora was on his wny
on scheduled time to drip at the
third, when his taxicab suffered a
blow out, delaying him five minutes.
At the third theatre nil was pande
monium for the hero had mounted the
rock the heroine was struggling and
because Kamora had failed to put in
an appearanco the film had to be
stopped. The spectators were fran
tic and cries of "Kuti-kuU" ("jump,
jump") were heard on all sides. Fin
ally Kamora arrived and shouted at
the operator, the picture went on and
"Jumped" him and he dashed out onto
the stage, nut alas he was no longer

London, Oct. 27. There has been
another clash between Itritish and
German destroyers. The conflict was
in the Itritish channel which has not
beiore been penetrated by Gretnan

Only a few details have been given
out by the admiralty, but it is be

the English coast when they were met

and patrol boats.
The oliicial report announces the
loss of the destroyer Flirt and states
that the Nubian was disabled and had
to be run ashore. The old transport
Queen was sunk but without loss of
life.
Two German destroyers are known
to have been sunk and two are said to
be so badly damaged that they will

of the rensageki that they will not

evening derided to see the show. Af

highly incensed at the way the villain
was talking to everybody. So at the
close of the act they went out and
bought some ancient vegetables. The
management got wise to this.
The curtain's rise was accompanied
Ty curses and threats from the villain
who was still off stage. The veget
ables were poised to be hurled. Sud

BOYS' CLUB GROWING
Organizations Number 150 With 3793
in Membership.
Burlington, Oct. 24. Tho annual re
port of K. L. Ingalls, in charge of
boys' and girls' club work in the ag
ricultural extension service, for tho
year ending June 30 wil show ma
terial progress over last year. Up to
June 30 there were 3.790 enrollments
and 152 organized groups or clubs.
Half of the total number of would-be
farmers and farmers' wives were in
these clubs, while the other half were
mainly individuals working indepen
dently. Orr June 30, 1915, there were
only 78 groups and a total of. 1.3S0
youngsters at work. Tho proportions
in and outside of the groups were
about equal.
Among the recommendations which
Mr. Ingalls will make in his coming
report, to be issued at the end of the
year, will be to create certain new
clubs an apple and a maple, sugar
club, for instance to meet needs that
have long existed, but have not been
filled. There were eleven of these so
called projects this year, covering the
rntsme- at corn, notatoes. gardening
