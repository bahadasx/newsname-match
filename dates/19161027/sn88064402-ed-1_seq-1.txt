IN LOCAL RICE SALES
Tl~largest transaction in rice ever
r.r.nd:ed in '... h d!.ring nr;, history
of the rice gr.\ro\ing industry in this
section was <<'' ,immated the first of
this week wh~ the Southern Rice
Growers' .mLtion sold to the
Standard Mili :t ('rowley between
twenty and :hirty thousand sacks of
Blue Rose at fuI as~sociation values.
This singlk tr:, a:ction represents ap
proximately 11O1000. The Rickett
Mill of New O!re:ins, the Orange Mill,
the Louisiana State aon.l the Lake
Charles Mill have also been limited

timated that d:i ng the first two days
this week ,,h4ut :t.000() sacks of rice
have changed hands in Welsh. The
approximate returns from these sales
is about $140,010. A pretty good

Mamager Abbott of the Southern Rice
Growers found time to inform the
representativ(' of the Journal that in
spite of these l:rge deals the condition
of the market is steadily improving,
and it is almost a settled fact that
Jlues will increase. He believes
that the Asso:,iation cannot afford to
put a price on rice at this time that
will prohibit immediate consumption.
This has been the hardest fight that
- the association has ever put up and
is a victory beyond suestion of doubt.
This should convince every farmer
interested in the growing of rice of
what can be accomplished if each one
would only lend a small part of his
time to this great cause.
The high cost of living is bound to
teach us a clear lesson of economy and
will consequently lead us to careful
methods. Farming must be reduced
to a scientific basis, and the process
or solution for the maintenance of val
ues can only be handled through the
channels which the local offices of the
Southern Rice 'Growers asdiociation
control.
The association is steadily growing
aad getting better quqaqqfiqlqide rh
sad getting better qualified for the
handling of the great problems which
will confront it, and it is confidently
hoped that these recent transactions
which have been successfully closed
will have an influential bearing on
thoe who are still out of the associa

JENNINGS STEPS TO REAR
IN BASKET BALL GAME.
Last Saturday the Welsh high
school basket ball team defeated the
Jennings high school team by a score
of thirty-four to nineteen. The
Welsh second team also defeated the
Jennings second team by a score of
fifteen to one. Both of these victories
for Welsh in face of the flounted claim
of the Jennings fans that they would
perve the attendants with "Welsh
Rarebit."
A number of teachers, scholars and
sympathizers went with the teams
from Welsh to see the game and they
were well pleased with the results.
The games werec very interesting
throughout with a good crowd of
spectators present. Prof. Arnold L.
Pierce as umpire; Mr. Hazel of Jen
nings, referee; Prof. W. P. Arnette,
official score keeper; W. W. Dejean,
official tiine keeper.
The Welsh boys feel that the out
come of this game somewhat miti
gates the offense they committed in
letting Lake Arthur carry off the
laurelq the" Saturday before.
The Welsh High School girls will
play the Lake Arthur high School
girls on the Welsh campus next Sat
urday and a very interesting game is
expected. Everyone is invited to
come out and boost the home girls.

ALEXIS P. ARCENEAUX I
SUOCUMBS FROM BURNS
A very sad accident early Monday
morning resulted in the untimely t
death of one of Jefferson Davis par- I
ish's very oldest residents, Mr. Alexis in
P. Arceneaux. e
Although past eighty-two years of e
age Mr. Arceneaux had enjoyed very a
good health and unusual spryness un- g
til he suffered a slight paralytic stroke 14
in November, 1915, since which time
he has suffered the loss of sight and -
con ,quent;,i has been 'confined to ii
home. V
Monday morning his (laughter, Mrs. o
Adam Bourque, brought Mr. Arce- a
neaux his coffee in his room as usual, t
returning to the rear of the house 1
to prepare breakfast. A few minutes p
later Mrs. Bourque hearing a cry v
rushed to his room to find her father
lying across the upset oil heater en- v
veloped in flames from the burning D
oil. He was removed from the room
and the flames extinguished. Phy- I
sicians called in discovered that he (
was so badly ia:ned that there was no t
hope of recovery. The accident hap- t
pened at seven o'clock and at nine a
o'clock Mr. Arceneaux (lied in the
presence of immediate members of v
the family and friends.
Alexis Perrin Arceneaux was bore (
in St. Martin parish July 15, 1834, (
the son of Mr. and Mrs. Alexander e
Arceneaux. He was the seventh of a l
family of eight children, only one of
whom survive him, Mrs. Joseph Da
marist, who lives south of Welsh. He
was a veteran of the Civil War, hav
ing served four years in one of the
Louisiana commands. In 1853 he
moved with the family to the place
south of Welsh that is now known as
the Mayville Plant, having enjoyed a
continuous residence in what is now
Jefferson Davis parish of sixty-one
years. There are very few people
living today who can have even a con
ception of what life in this section in I
those days really meant. Later he set- I
tied on what is known as the Arce
neaux plantation, 8 mni!es south of
Welsh, just south of Bayou Chien,
where he farmed successfully for
more than thirty years. On this '
place be developed the first and larg
est orange grove in this section. Lat
er he moved to Welsh, engaging in the
hotel and the meat market business
fori a, few years, and then returned
to the farm which he personally
looked after until the fall of 1911,
when he sold all of his estate and came
to live with his daughter, Mrs. Adam
Bourque in Welsh.
In 1865 he was married to Miss Fe
lonsie Bellard and to their union seven
children were born, four daughters
and three sons, one son having died
at the age of seven years. He is sur
by his wife. The sons and daugh
ters are Mrs. T. H. Cox, Mrs. Adam
'Bourque, Mr. A. L. Arceneaux, Mr.
A. R. Arceneaux and Mr. A. L. Arce
neaux of Welsh; Mrs. Adelia Floyd of
Houston, Texas; Mrs. C. P. Martin of
Lake Charles, and one step-son, Mr.
Cyprien Bellard, who lives south of
Welsh.
Although not a regular attendant
at church, Mr. Arceneaux was brought
up and always remained a firm believ
er in the Catholic faith. The funeral
services were held at the Catholic
church in Welsh Tuesday morning at
9:00 o'clock. The services were con
ducted by Rev. Father J. P. Ferret,
assisted by Father Cramers, deacoa,
of Lake Charles, and Father Peters,
sub-deacon, of Jennings, and inter
ment in the Catholic cemetery.

HOUSTON-NEW ORLEANS
HIGHWAY ASSOCIATION
Lake Charles, Oct. 21.--The forma- sI
tion of the Houston-lNew Orleans o'
Highway association here yesterday L
marks the beginning of a determined tl
effort on the part of the business men al
of Houston, Lake Charles, Beaumont v
and intervening towns and cities to ri
get a paved highway from New Or- T
leans to Houston. f
This matter began to take definite V
-shape at a meeting which was held a
in New Orleans, September 20th. It d
was at this meeting that a temporary tl
organization was formed and a com- S
mittee on organization appointed and ti
the meeting set for Lake Charles. S
The work begun at New Orleans was e
perfected here and the organization
went into permanent form. c
The officers of the new organization u
were named as follows: Homer D. 11
Matthews, Houston, president; J. O.
Sims,'Orange, vice president; E. A. ti
Pharr, Morgan City, vice president; f
G. B. Bayliss, Lake Charles, secre- 0
tary; Robert Lagier, New Orleans, g
treasurer, and B. K. Coghlan, Texas, F
advisory engineer.
The following directors at large d
were chosen: P. W. Milner, New Or- o
leans; B. W. Turnbow, Beaumont; 11
George W. Graham, Houston; H. G.
Chalkley, Lake Charles; E. P. Pick
ett, Liberty. Several directors at d
large are yet to be chosen. Port t
Arthur and several other- cities are
entitled to directors at large.
BULLETIN FOR TEACHERS t
OF PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY c
"Suggestions for Laboratory Work I
and Equilpment in Physical Geog- t
raphy" is the title of the October I
monthly bulletin of the Louisiana d
State University. This article is by i
F. V. Emerson, professor of geology. I
The purpose of the article is to aid c
teachers of physical geography in s
preparing laboratory work and equip- t
ping the. laboratory. Attention is e
called to the fact that physical geog- I
raphy 'has a.-elose connection with I
grade geography, history and com- i
mercial geography. The grade geog
raphy emphasizes location and dis
tribution, while physical geography
explains many of these locations and 1
distributions. For example, the
student has learned that cotton flour
ishes in the lower South; from his
study of physical geography he should
know the conditions of temperature,
rainfall and frost that limit cotton
to these districts.
Among the cases in point that il
rustrate the close connection between
history and physical geography may
be mentioned the well known influ
ence of the Appalachian mountains as
barriers in restricting the expansion
.( the English colonies, and on the
other hand, the influence of the ram
ifying Mississippi river system in
spreading the French colonists over
the basin. Again, it is obvious that
many current events will be more in
teresting and intelligible of the earth
factors are known and appreciated.
In the European war we have the
Iwinter and summer campaigns and
the mountain and plains campaigns.
The weather will often influence an
election by bringing out or withhold
ing the rural vote. In fact, there is
scarcely an issue of the daily paper
that does not afford material for the
class in physical geography.
Of course, there is a close connec
tion with commercial geography.
Climates, soils, rivers, plains, moun
tains, etc., are important alike in
physical .and commercial geography.
Teachers of physical geography will
find in this bulletin many outlines and
suggestions that should prove very
Svaluable in their work.- Copies of it
may be obtained by addressing the
Secretary, Louisiana State University,
Baton Rouge, La.

4RVEST NEAR COMPLED
IN THIS SECTION
Rainfall of last week has retarded
the rice harvest for a day or two, but
nevertheless the action of the weather
man in this case has met with the ap
proval of everyone. The excessive
(lust is settled, cisterns and wells that
were becoming dry are filled, fresh
water is supplied for the stock on the
prairies. In many cases cattle have
died for lack of fresh water during
the long dry spell.
It is a remarkable fact that nearly
seventy-five per cent of the Japan rice
crop this year has been harvested
and threshed without a drop of rain
falling on it. In a number of casee
farmers with four and five hundred
acres have harvested, threshed and
warehoused their Entire crop since the
last rain.
Fully ninety per cent of the crop
in this section is saved, and with an
other week of good weather the I916
harvest season will be practically
over. In th, sections south and west
of Welsh, the harvest is not quite so
well advanced, but is pirogressing
rapidly.
The mills are buying freely, espe
cially of Blue Rose which is the favor
ite in every instance, although the
shortage of cars is materially retard
ing its movement. In a few instances
farmersr outside of the association
are accepting prices a little below the
schedule of the association, but on the
average a fair price is being received
for the crop.

VILLA 6ETS BARGAIN
IN WAR MUNITIONS
El Paso, Texas, Oct. 25.-Govern
ment agents here claim to have re
ceived additional confirmation of
Villa's reported defeat of General
Ozuna's Carranza column at Palomas,
west of Chihuahua City, last Friday.
The confirmation is said to have come
from refugees reaching the border
from Chihuahua City who claim that
Villa captured General Ozuna's col
umn of eleven troops and supply
trains carrying ammunition, arms,
machine guns and supplies.
The refugees who brought this re
port to the border claim to have
talked with survivors of Ozuna's col
umn who said Villa lead the Carranza
troops into a trap at Palomas, then
attacked from the front, flank and
rear, and cut the railroad line behind
the trains. The same source claims
250 soldiers of Carranza' were killed
and equal number taken prisoner.
