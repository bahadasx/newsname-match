President Wilson lias handled the
Mexican situation so well in tho past
three and one-half years that it is
necessary to koop ovor 100,000 Amor

It is good news to know that the
Vermont State Boys' and Girls' Agri
cultural and Industrial exposition is to
bo made a permanent organization.
Such' a gathering as that held in Bur
iiifgton this fall will bo very helpful
in arousing interest in agriculture, arts
and crafts among tho young people
It, would 'bo a good plan to havo tho
annual exhibition held in rotation in
four or five of tho largest communities

Tho Democrats of Massachusetts arc
having a harrowing time trying to get
a camlidato who can make a decent
showing against Henry Cabot Lodge for
United States senator. At tho recent
primaries, ox-Mayor Fitzgerald of Bos
ton, who has been making a sort ot
campaign for the office, got such a
frost that ho was attacked with n
sevoro caso of cold feet and wanted to
pull out. But nono could bo found
who could or would put up tho dough
that was desired. First, ov-Gov. W. L
Douglas declined with thanks. Then
Richard Olney guessed lie did' not want
to run. Then Lawyer ijherman Whip
plo, cv-Gov. Walsh, ex-Pros. Eliot of
Harvard, ex-Mayor Marcus Coolldgo of
Fitehburg, and soveral other ex's, re
ported nothin' doin', and at last in ut
tor despair tho party had to fall back
again on "Honey" Fitz, who is always
on tho spot, but don't always connect
all right. Lodge stands stronger in Mas
sachusotts than ovor before and tho
Democratic liomineo against him will
simply be a, mark to be kuocked down.
Charles M. Cox, writing from St. Al
bans to tho Burlington Free PreBS,
urges tho farmers of New England to
specialize. He points out that thou
sands of farmers of this section of tho
country aro getting along and earning
a living, but that tho men who aro
making from $5,000 to $2o,000 a year
not out of tho soil are the ones who
dovoto their energies to ono crop, who
study that ono question so .thoroughly
that they aro able to ovcrcomo obsta
clcs to tho extent that in tho courso of
timo there coases to bo an clement of
doubt about securing a crop in any
one year, Tho onion and tobacco
growers of tho Connecticut river val
ley, tho men in Wrenthnm, Mass., who
raise over 50,000 I'okin ducks in n
year, and tho owners of big poultry
farms who havo thousands.' of layiu
fowls of ono variety, producing so-
called fnncy eggs for tho city market
aro making n bigger success financially
than many of tho manufacturers nnd
morchnnts. And tlioy unquestionably
enjoy life moro than tho mon who are
tied down to tho routino of offlco nr
fairs.

Tho Grango fairs and tho small town
fairs fill an important placo in rural
life. Tho big fairs with their varied
attractions pleaso the crowd, and fill a
useful purpose. Thoy havo becomo al
most expositions, but they do not to
any great extent promote rivalry
among the farmers and their families.
The exhibits of livo stock of all kinds
aro mado mainly by men witli somo of
tlio finest collections of animals in
their respective classes in tho country.
Tlieso exhibitors preparo their horses,
cattle, sheep, swino and poultry for a
round of tho fairs. Thoy are out for n
clean-ilp of tho big premiums. Thoy
havo tho goods and they tnko tho
tho cash. Tho ordinary farmer has no
chanco against them. But in the
smnllor fairs tho men who till tho soil
and who ralso stock on tho homo farms
got together in n friendly spirit, each
trying to excel tho otliors. They ox
ciiaugo ideas which aro of mutual bono'
lit. Their rivalry nnd competition ro
suits in bettor stock nnd hotter farm
products. Thoro ought to bo something
in tho way of a fair in every small town
in New England.

Every now aad then someone an
nounces solemnly that back in Jull or
Koo or some sucli timo tar enough back
for uo one alive today to be able to provo
it, it cost more to livo than it noes now.
Ihey add thut things righted them
selves, if they were worse then than
they arc now with the promise that
they aru to bo worse before "righting

thankful that they did not arrive ou
this mundane sphere a couple of hun

A caretul inspection of the loner list

cuusiuurauic proui to somebody except

idence that lice is the only article of
food that a man caa afford to buy and

will have to be eaten raw for tho cost
of heat units is mounting so steadily
mat. in a tew weeks it is promised that
either tho climate has go, to change its
long time custom of helping out tho

"What liiahcs mop handles go up in

llio salesman indicated the metal on

Housemaid s knee will soon become n

As for coal Brattleboro is fortunnto
just at present in that the dealors havo

where $9.50 a ton is charged. Tho
doleful information is extended, how

GERMANS SMASH RUMANIANS.

Two features of the European war
situation stand out with distinctness
this week: The Germans nnd their al
lies have delivered a smashing blow at
tho Rumanians and thoir Russian asso
ciates, havo captured Constunza, an im
portant terminal port on the Black sea,
and now hold in their possession the
main railway line of tho country; on
the other front tho French, realizing
that tho Gcrninn lino around Verdun
had been weakened to send troops to
tho other front, hnvo struck with ter
rible force, winning in a fow hours
fields which it had taken the Germans
mouths to possess. Tho French swept
forward over tho fortified ground for n

important villnges.
