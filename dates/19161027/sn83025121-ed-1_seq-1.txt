men are h(ne; enormously increased in
alxe and efficiency. ":
It ia asserted by those in a position
to know of the information held by

for his use has. been, more effective
than any other one thing in making
him the serious menace to the de facto
government, which be has become.
The state department official an
nounced that though- they are still
working on the trail ef the plot they
have not as yet succeeded in obtain

Not a Political Mm
"It ia not a political move," said
Mr. I.annlng, "but w believe that it
is a most desirable thing to (live whut
