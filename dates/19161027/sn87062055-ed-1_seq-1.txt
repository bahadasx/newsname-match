COLONEL ROOSEVELT
! SPEAKS TO 8,000 PEOPLE
AT PHOENIX SATURDAY
Ex-President Roosevelt and party
.went 'through Flagstaff during" the
night last Friday onMhelr way to
Phoenix where the Colonel addressed
a record crowd, estimated to be at
least 8,000 people. On their way
south' thoy were taken by a special
iraln, but returned, Sunday night
coming through Flagstaff in a private
car on No. 10.
4 No .notice was given along the line
here of their coming or going and
'consequently there was no crowd out
to see the famous and foremost, citi
zen of the country.
' His talk at Phoenix was direct to
the point and on subjects most inter
esting to the people. There was no
heckeling, for there 'are very few
"normal people who desire to attempt
that sort of tactics with the doughty
colonel. Instead of being asked, he
went straight to the point and ad
vised his hearers that while he was
president ho had advocated the con
8olidation of Indian territory and
Oklahoma, as well as the consolida
tion of Arizona and New Mexico, for
Teasons he considered good, but the
then governor Joseph H. Kibbey, his
friend and appointee, refused to ac
cent his iudement and it was largely
through the influence of Governor
Kibbey that Arizona and New Mexico
dljl not become one state. And to
former Governor .Kibbey, he gave the
credit in greater part for Arizona be
ing a sovereign state today, in its
own right,. rather than being a part
of New Mexico.
His araingmnt of the Mexican po
licy of President Wilson covered the
ground entirely and seemed to leave
nothing unsaid on Hhc subject, re
peating the many atrocities against
Americans that were well known to
individual members of the audience
who had been" driven out of the coun
try because of a lack of protection.
He avers, that more people, men,
American women and children, have
been starved, kilW and murdered in
cold1 blood in Mexico during the "re
volutions" in the past three years
than" the number of American sol
diers killed durincr the Spanish-Amer
ican war. The Spanish-American war
stopped the "war," settled the ques
tion for all time to come; proved that
the "American hog" could and would
fight; the Mexican situation still goes
on with but little hope for the lives,
property or dignity of the American
nation. .
AROUND WORLD ON FOOT
A. van den Enden, the "around the
world on foot" tramp, was in Flag
staff Monday on his way east from
San Francisco. Ho started on his
Journey around the world from Brus
sels on March 23rd, 1914, together
with two others who later fell by the
wayside on account of illness.
He started, out on a wager of $5,000
with the others that they could travel
around the world and make a living
by selling post cards, but is not al
lowed to beg, borrow or steal. At
the present time he has traveled 78,
000 miles and when the trip is ended
will be in round numbers 160,000
miles. Enden is certainly a husky
looking hombre and has clippings tell
ing of his prowess as a wrestler, hav
ing downed the champion wrestler of
tho American army during his trip
across the continent.
He gave a very interesting lecture
on his travels at the Empress theatre
Monday evening.
Saw Carriage Bucks Off Wilson
Louie Wilson, is carrying a badly
bruised and sprained arm around in
a sling as a result of an accident at
the McGonigle mill at Riorda n last
week. Louie used to be n real
artist on a carriage some years ago
and had only taken on the Job again
temporarily when an accident hap
pened to theTthing some way, and
bumped into" the blocks a couple times
before it could be stopped by tho
i sawyer; he was thrown in among the
ratchets and came very near going
through the saw on one trip the car
riage made. His arm was banged up
and sprained and will take about as
'long as a real fracture to heal up
again.
W D. Grant for Constable
Wm. D. Grant is making a fast
race for the office of Constable for the
Flagstaff precinct and his many
, vfriends claim he is a sure winner. He
" has many friends among all classas
of people and is very much a hustler,
though this is his first entry into
politics. ,
He is well qualified to handle the
Job -and -will "give the people good
satisfactory service. .
THE PEOPLE OF
y 4
The "Tom Campbell meeting" held
in Flagstaff last Tuesday evening,
was one of the best political meetings
that has yet been held in Flagstaff.
The, Orpheum theatre, was filled with
a most attentive audience, men and
women ,who came with and earnest
desire to listen to the talks of the
different candidates and make a .deci
sion as to their fitness for the offices
they are seeking, in comparison to
the nominees on the democratic ticket
who talked here a short time ago.
There seemed to be a constant de
mand for "Tom Campbell" from early
morning, even before he reached
Flagstaff until away long late at
night. Campbell buttons were at a
premium and there was not one that
could be found not in usc. Over
30,000 of them have been distributed
through the state and the rest of the
Campbell boosters will have to wait
until a new supply can be made for
them. A thousand of them no where
near filled the demand in Flagstaff
and there is a constant demand for
more of them. This is something of
an indication as to how popular
Campbell ism this section of the
country and how strong the people
are going to 'vote that way next No
vember. He was greeted every where as
"governor" and held many a small
ovation as he made his way around
the city, democrat and republican
alike giving him the "glad hand."
Hon. Henry L. Eads, candidate for
congress, headed the list of speakers
of the evening, and owing to the
number of speakers present only
briefly outlined the things he sought
to do in the next congress, convincing
his hearers that in the next republican
congress he would deliver more goods
and less speeches to his constituents.
Doane Merrill, candidate for the
office of state auditor and bank ex
aminer, gave his auditors a straight
forward statement pt conditions and
SHOULD ESTABLISH A
CENTRALJOJATO MARKET
A. G. Bader, the Delicatessen man,
has gone into the potato business on
a wholesale plan and has purchased
the greater part of all the potatoes
raised by ranchers in the Cliffs coun
try. He was in Cliffs last week ar
ranging for the shipment of them in
carload lots to southern points, in
cluding Jerome, Prescott and Phoenix.
He expects to ship at least twenty
carloads from Cliffs during the next
few weeks as fast a3 they can be
brought in and properly sorted.
Mr. Bader says potatoes are now
quoted at $2 per hundred pounds but
will soon reach a hfgher price as there
is a general shortage in the crop this
year.
It, has been known for years that.if
the local potato raisers could central
ize their work in such a manner as
to properly handle them, they could
control a vast market and secure
much better prices for their crops.
The quality of the potatoes raised in
this section is recognized all over the
southwest as of the very best, are so
advertised by merchants and sought
by the people when they know where
to get them. s
A warehouse where they could be
properly sorted and put into boxes
rcadv for the market, would greatly
advance their price, cither by com
mission men or by an out-ngnt pur
chaser who knows how to handle
them and who can supply the demand.
Heretofore it has been only by buying
here and there a conglomeration of
trrades and kinds, other markets could
be supplied, which is very unsatis
factory to all concerned.
Marlar Building New Building
Will Marlar,, the druggist, has com
menced the building of two new
buildings on the property recently
purchased by him and known as the
old Coalter property on the corner of
Railroad avenue and Beaver street.
One building is being built for n
garage and will be of ample size for
the work, on the other side of the old
brick residence a good sized dance
hall is being built for the purpose oi
taking care of the young people who
wish to enjoy that festive pastime.
At present there is no place for their
parties as both theatre buildings have
built up floors and the1 other1 places
are taken up the other business.
ARIZONA. TIRED 0 UTBTIC GOVERNMENT
GOING TO ELEGT TQM CAMPBELL GOVERNOR AND
SEEK A NEW FREEDOM FROM AUTOCRATIC RULE
what conditions would be under his
administration. His hearers were con
vinced that he knew what He was
talking about and believed that in his
case "a public office would be a public
trust" and in no sense a private office
for the public salary. "Merrill" and
"merrit" are synonymous in his case.
TOM CAMPBELL
3 George H. Smalley, candidate for
state tax commissioner, the young
man who believes that the office he
seeks should be. n non-political ' one,
and one that serves the people of the
state rather than the politicians of the
state, favorably impressed his hear
ers. His whole life's traning has been
along lines which teaches the value
of details and, with a mind trained
to the technicalities of the office he
seeks, he would be a most valuable
asset to the people of the. whole, state,
financially, not politically.,
John L. Gust, candidate for tho
office of attorney general, regardless
of the fact that he would like to take
a couple hours of the time in review
ing the things that have come to pass
in the state of Arizona during the
past few years, briefly scanned the
LAMAR COBB, IRVIN COBB
ALL ATTEMPT TO TY COBB
Hon. Lamar Cobb, state engineer,
arrived In Flagstaff Sunday evening
and spent a few days here looking
after the different road projects now
under way by the state road makers.
Mr. Cobb while here, refused to admit
that Hughes would bo the next presi
dent of the United States, being from
the rock-ribbed "republican" state of
Georgia, he was inclined to think that
there would be a considerable of a
contest for the place and that Wilson
would get better than a majority,
especially in the southern states.
Texas, he believed showed some dem
ocratic symptoms even at this early
stage of the game.
In the caso of Governor Hunt he
was much more positive, knowing that
Governor Hunt could select the best
state engineer the state ever had,
with reasons to further believe he
would continue the said state engi
neer in office.
About all the mean things we could
say about him at the present time, is
that the Globe Record says he is for
tho Southern Ocean to Ocean high
way, and is making a special tour of
the state just at this time when poli
tics arc getting awfully ripe.
' August Ericson Dies of Typhoid
August Ericson, a native of
Swecden, who has been working the
past summer at the Greenlaw log
ging camp, died at the Milton hospi
tal Sunday afternoon of typhoid fever,
after three weeks of suffering. He
was born in Sweeden in 1889 and was
well thought of by his fellow work
men in the woods. He has one brother
in this country, John Ericson, who
was with him at the time of his
death. The remains were buried in
ihe local cemetery Tuesday.
Baron N. J. Ritter to be Married
N. J. Ritter, the sheep baron of the
city of Jerome Junction will be mar
ried on November 1st, to Miss Brown
ing, at the home of her brother in
Chicago. Miss Browning is a native
of Kentucky. The groom to be is a
well known sheep man and generally
called "the baron" because of his dis
tinguished manners and dignified air,
including the fact that he hampers
several thousand head of sheep en the
range in the Jerome Junction coun-
try- . .
" They will make their home in Ari
zona. , ,'"' ....,
situation with things most important
in his estimation. In the short space
of time alloted him, he impressed his
audienco with the fact that he would
be an attorney general that the people
could well be proud of and rely upon
asa man who would be a credit to the
state.
Without attempting to criticise the
out-going administration, or put, forth
any spectacular views as to innova
tions in the educational system of the
state, Mr. H. E. Matthews, candidate
for state superintendent of schools,
gave the people addressed a most
favorable impression. They felt in
stinctively that he knew what he was J
talking about, and knew that if the
school affairs of the state were en
trusted to him, there would be pro
gress, regardless of politics or pre
vious conditions which may have been
hampered by other than purely edu
cational reasons. He convinced the
audience that he was a strong man
and one who could be thoroughly
trusted to s"erve the people, will and
right.
There was no need of introducing
Tom Campbell and the audience did
not give the chairman a chance to do
so. At the conclusion of the orchestral
rendition of "The Star Spangled Ban
ner," the audience knew that it was
his turn to go over the situation with
them in a. heart-to-heart talk, cover- J
ing conditions as they actually exist
Joday in the great state the coming
state of Arizona. As only one who
has delved deeply into the taxable
conditions can, he put the proposition
straight up to his audience; as one
1 who had been instrumental in getting
tno taxes paid into tne treasury oi
,th- state, he told where hp could be
equally as well qualified on the spend
ing end of the game in .handling the
people's money. There were no
questions asked him as to where he
would cut off expenditures he told
them direct where there could be big
savings of the people's money and
FRIENDS SELECT MRS. FRED
ALLEN FOR SUPT. OF SCHOOLS
The many friends of Mrs. Bozena
(Fred) Allen, who have so staunchly
stood for her during the primary
election and who believe she is most
competent to fill the office of county
superintendent of schools, are still in
sistently urging her candidacy for the
office with a feeling that her ability
and understanding especially fits her
for the place.
Mrs. Allen' is thoroughly qualified
for the place and is a lady of many
talents, including a musical ability
well known and freely- given by her
for any public benefit. It is her first
introduction into politics and while
the field is somewhat new and strange
to her, she has made many steadfast
friends during the short campaign
nnd whatever may be the outcome,
though her friends are sincere in
their belief that she will be success
ful, many a stranger will be added to
her list of friends to remain for years
to come.
The position of school superintend
ent is a most important one and one
where tact, executive ability and per
sonality are required to a marked de
gree to successfully build up the
schools of the county and to keep
them doing good work throughout the
school year. Mrs. Allen has these re
quirements, every one, and her
friends are most earnestly urging her
election in November.
GLAD TO BE HOME AGAIN
Mr. T. J. Bristow and family re
turned to Flagstaff Wednesday from
Idaho, where they have made their
home for the past twelve years. Mr.
Bristow was one of the pioneer set
tlers of this section of the country
and Is mighty well pleased to get
bock again to his old haunts among
the mountains and valleys of North
ern Arizona. He came to Flagstaff,
in 1875, worked for "LO" cattle com
pany, later for P. J. Brannen and at,
one time run cattle in the Camp Ver
de country for himself. He was
greatly surprised at tlie growth Flag
staff has made during the time he wo3
away, but like many other. old timer,
smiled a pleased mile at being back j
again among the old pines and the
stamping grounds of early days. "I
feel like I had got home again; the
climate here if nothing else, ought to
make Flagstaff grow; The Sun has
been like a letter from home all the
time I have been away."
where he would save it for them. In
other words, he was not seeking the
office in the special interests of the
"tax-enters," but in the interest of
the "tax payers," presuming that such
a policy might and would be in the
direct Interest of the whole people
and not a policy which seems to the
people to be in the special interest of
the few poor criminals some few
hundred as against the entire popula
tion of the state, whom it appears,
Gov. Hunt believes are of more im
portance than all the rest of the peo
ple of the state who are so careless
as to not have broken any of the laws
of the state in the way of rapine,
murder or robbery. While Mr. Camp
belll did not mention this in particu
lar, he did aver that he believed in the
laws that the people themselves had
sanctioned; the people were to govern
as to the laws they wanted, and, that
he, as chief executive of the state
would enforce them.
There was not a movement in the
audience, except in the way of ap
plause until he had finished his talk,
and then only by a forward movement
of those who wished to shake his
hand and tell him that they were for
him and there was a goodly sprink
ling of democrats and other denomi
nations who pledged him their un
qualified support
The party of candidates left for
Cliffs for a short morning meeting
and from there went to Holbrook, for
an evening meeting.
The feeling left among the people
here is that the whole delegation of
republicans whose names appear on
the state ticket are men who have
been selected because of merit rather
than because of their especial political
usefulness to the politicians and party
managers.
As an honest matter of fact, The
Coconino Sun, and other .business
houses can not afford to hire men be
cause of their political beliefs can
you?
COUNTY WILL PAVE COUPLE
MILESJF ROAD EAST
The County rood from Flagstaff city
limits east is about the worst the
county has to deal with, considering
the length of it and amount of travel
over it. The board of spervisors
agreed to the expenditure of a suffici
ent amount of money to put down at
least 1H miles of cinders sixteen
feet, wide on this piece of road. The
cinders will cover the road eight
inches in depth requiring some eighty
carloads which have been contracted
for from the Santa Fe, to be deliver-,
ed here at a price of sixty cents per
ton.
An improvement much needed on
this road was made when a steel
bridge was put in by the county at
the Johnson place, recently by County
Engineer Power;
Something New Under The "Sun."
While, of course "Coconino," isn't
just the easiest name in the world for
an easterner to unload from his chest
or typewriter, we received a letter
from Chicago the other day that
rather staggered us. It was addressed
to 'The Cokannutn Sun." It has been
willed "Coconut," "Cocola" and even
(wear words, but "Cokannuta" is a
llumb new designations and sounds
a though it came from Minnesota.
Paid $20 for a Hunting License
Deputy State Game Warden Zach
Eakins went down to Pine the latter
part of last week and gathered up a
man by the name of A. M. Lufkin,
who had been reported as hunting
game without a license. He Was taken,
over to Payson where he pled guilty
to the charge and was assessed a $20
fine for his neglect in getting one of
the cheaper ones that only cost about
fifty cents when voluntarily pur
chased. Will Marlar Loses Father
Mr. Will Marlar received word Mon
day advising him of the death of his
father in the old home in Arkansas.
He had been suddenly stricken with
pneumonia and Mrs. Marlar and Mrs.
Jordan, a sister of Mr.. .Marlar, were
on their way to Arkansas but did not
reach there until after his death.
His friends here sympathize with him
in his irreparable loss.
GRANDEST FAKE OF
II POLITICAL GAME
IS
The following bone-head fabrica
cation is one of the most bald political
jobs ever attempted in the "news"
line that has come to our notice in
years. It was probably intended for
political affect, and the truth was not
even flirted with:
"Arizona" will go democratic at the'
general election November 7th by a
5,000 majority, and Gov. G. W. P.
Hunt will, be reelected.
Such is the opinion of Former Pre
sident Theodore Roosevelt who passed
through Flagstaff Sunday evening at
8:20 enroute from Phoenix to Albu
querque where he spoke yesterday.
'Not only does Mr. Roosevelt give
Arizona to the democrats by 5,000 but
be is also of the opinion that the
workingmen all through the west are
solid for President Wilson, and that
the workingmen of Arizona are solid
for Governor Hunt
Mr. Roosevelt further expressed
himself that Northern Arizona and
Northern New Mexico are practically
solid .'democratic, but' that in the
southern portions of the two states
where there have been Mexican depre
dations the people are strong against
Wilson. Leader.
The truth of the matter is that the
editor of The Sun was at the train
and stood by the Roosevelt private
car; Roosevelt did not see anyone
locally and made no statement what
ever. If this is a fair sample of the poli
tical rot and absolute misrepresenta
tion the Leader intends giving to the
people up in this neck 'o the woods
where they have been in the habit of
getting some semblcncc of the truth,
the quicker th people know it the
better, regardless of their . special
political beliefs.
"No Word of Truth in the Story"
Says Colonel Roosevelt
Denver, Oct. 24 Special Regis H.
Post, former governor of Porto Rico
and acting secretary to Colonel Roose
velt, stated tonight that there is ab
solutely no truth in a Flagstaff special
to the effect that Mr. Roosevelt con
ceeded Arizona to the democrats.
"The report that Mr. Roosevelt con
ceded Arizona democratic is a lie
pure and simple," said Mr. Post.
"There is absolutely no truth in the
report."
HUGHES ALLIANCE GROWING
RAPIDLY
Mrs. Eva Marshall, who is very
much interested in the organization
and growth of the Hughes Alliance,
which is gaining much headway
throughout the state, reports that the
Alliance is gaining at the rate of over
100 members a day in the state and
that the local branch, of the organi
zation has made a splendid growth
since it was organized a short time
ago.
A neat Alliance button is being
given out by the local branch to men
and women and they have been pick
ed up eagerly by both men and wom
en voters. The Hughes Alliance clubs
are organized all over the country
and are for the purpose of aiding in
the election of Mr. Hughes, regard
less of the other candidates or the
previous political affiliations of the
members.
WINSLOW WINS PRESCOTT
FOOTBALL GAME
The Winslow high school football
team went down to Prescott and tied
into the Hi boys at that place Satur
day, returning with a complete vic
tory of 12 to 0.
They returned on No. 10 Sunday
night' and got off the train long
enough to "ruz-huz-buz" a few times
ndvising the local Normal team what
they were going to do to them when
they met again on the pot pourri.
Really football is all right, but we.
never could understand why the .boys
get so many scabs on their faces in
stead of corns on their feet.
