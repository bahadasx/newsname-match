Points to Ability in Diplomatic
Matters—Comparison With
Burke
Hon. Fred A. Britten of Chicago,
congressman from the Ninth Illinois
district, was in the capital city yes­
terday, stopping here enroute from
Logan, Mcintosh and Emmons coun­
ties, where he had been campaigning
in the interest of Senator Porter J.
McCumber.
oCngressman Britten is a strong
supporter of the North Dakota sena­
tor, and in an interview with a Tri­
bune representative he gave out the
following statement:
Dakota's Gift to Nation.
Senator McCumber he regards as
North Dakota's gift to the nation and
the best advertisement North Dako­
ta has.
"I am in your state speaking for
McCumber in the interest of the peo­
ple of the nation, all of whom claim
your senator as one of tlieir most val­
ued public servants.
"During the last four years the
house has lost such great legislators
as Senators Root, Burton and Cullom,
so that the loss of McCumber at this
time would be a national one not
i»-.iily replaced.
The Close of the War.
"The close of the Europena war
wiH bring with it a transformation of
our internal as well as foreign poli­
cies and McCumber's eighteen years
on the committee on foreign relations
will make him a power in the next
congress, when his wonderful ability
in diplomatic affairs must prove in­
valuable to the entire nation and will
go far towards preserving our rights
in any-new agreements with the pow­
ers now lacerating Europe.
"We all agree that a revision of the
tariff must occur and in order to pre­
vent the closing of our factories and
the stagnation of our labor markets,
when peace has been declared in Eur­
ope and the 30,000,000 highly trained
and most efficient men now in the
fields and trenches return to their
usual Industrial pursuits.
The Industrial Invasion.
"These men have been fighting for
the fatherland, be it England, France
or Russia, at a salary of ten cents a
day and will deem it a further pleas­
ure to assist their country in acquir­
ing our gold through the sale of man­
ufactured articles and farm products
at a salary from 50 cents to $1.00 a
day. This is the only method by
which their country can re-assert it
self among the first nations of'the
world, and this sacrifice will be gladly
met in preference tc the severe test
to which they have been subjected
during the past two or two and a half
years.
"And there again comes the invalu­
able McCumber with his eighteen
years of experience on the finance
committee which will regulate and re­
vise the tariff in the next congress.
Man of Ability and Bravery.
"Senator McCumber is a man of ex­
tra ability, bravery and high sense of
justice, and to this can be added his
originality of thought and his con­
stant preparation to be of service to
his country.
"In this he is distinctly different
from his oppenent, Mr. Burke, the
United States treasurer, who has
shown lack of ability, no initiative, no
originality and a thorough mis-con­
ception of his high office.
Regards to Burke.
"The only time I have seen," said
Congressman Britten, "the name of
United States Treasurer Burke in
print in the Washington papers was
the day following the confirmation of
his appointment by the United States
senate.
"In the pasage of the bankers' fed­
eral reserve act, in which the United
States treasurer should have taken an
active part, Mr. Burke was as silent
as the dead.
Burke's Inactivity.
"In the establishment of the feder­
al reserve districts, Mr. Burke allow­
ed Secretary McAdoo, the president's
son-in-law, to occupy the spotlight in
a matter in which he, the United
States treasurer, should have been
most active. He might as well have
been a clerk in the treasury depart­
ment.
"I am not saying this to criticise
Burke, but merely to indicate that he
lacks originality and initiative neces­
sary to make him a factor in the
United States senate, where he will
be surrounded and harrassed by the
best brains of the country.
Mr. McCumber is a tactician, a
man of much eloquence and one of
the best debaters in the American
congress."
Leader of Republican Wing.
Congressman Britten spoke last
evening at Medina. He is one of the
leaders of the Republican wing, being
a member of the committee on naval

DEATH IT POPULAR
John P. Stoddard Passes Away at
Sentinel Butte as Result of
Frontier-Day Injuries.
WAS ONE OF BEST KNOWN
LIVESTOCK MEN IN STATE
Tribune Special Service.)
Sentinel Bute, N. D., Oct. 26.—In­
juries sustained in the Elks' round-up
at Dickinson last July were indirectly
responsible for the death of John
Batcheller Stoddard, one of western
North Dakota's best known ranchers,
who passed away at his home here
this morning.
Mr. Stoddard had an active part
in staging the frontier celebration
which was a big feature of the stale
convention ol' the Elks in Dickinson
last summer. During the round-up he
was dragged from his horse as the
animal was about to enter the corral,
and he sustained a broken leg and
other injuries which confined him to
his bed for weeks. He was still in
a weakened condition, when, a short
time ago, he contracted typhoid fever,
which was the direct cause of his
death.
Prominent and Popular.
There probably was no more prom­
inent or popular stockman in the Bad
Lands region than John P. Stoddard.
He had in recent years been exten­
sively engaged in sheep-raising, and
his ranch of 7,000 acres was one of
the finest in the state. The deceased

"HUGHES CAN BE

Says Republican Candidate is a
Man of Honor and Can be
Depended On.
Chicago, Oct. 20.—Chicago women
cheered Col. Roosevelt today, when
he appealed to them not to be influ­
enced by the plea that President Wil­
son had kept the nation out of war.
When he told them he would fight at
the drop of the hat if necessary to
stop the murder of women and chil­
dren. they met the announcement
with a chorus of applause that delay­
ed the speaker, and he waited while
they rose and waved handkerchiefs
and flags.
The Colonel closed his western tour
here today, with two speeches, the
first exclusively to women.
There was no attempt at heckling
the speaker, the only interruption, ex
ce])1 for words of approval, being af­
ter he had described pictures of wom­
en and children killed in Mexico and
said he would have gone to war if
necessary to avoid that. Several
voices called "What about Hughes?"
Hughes Can Be Trusted.
"Mr. Hughes can be trusted to keep
his word." answered Col. Roosevelt.
"When he says that he would not
submit to such deeds as the sinking
of the Lusitania or the killing of our
citizens in Mexico, he means what he
says.
"When you are told to vote for
Wilson because he kept us out of war,
remember that is something that can­
not be said of either Washington or
Lincoln."
He was interrupted again when he
told of returning from the border,
where, he said, he found 150,000
troops Without knowing what they
were there for. "Wilson doesn't want
them to vote," called a woman. "The
Democratic platform said that the
Mexicans have made war on our peo
I pie," said the colonel. "The army in
Mexico was at war. So the Mexicans
are at war and our army is at war,
I but Mr. Wilson is at peace."
Women also applauded his refer­
ences to hyphenated citizenship.
"There is no room in this country
for the perpetuating of different na­
tionalities," he continued. To divide
our citizens along political racial
lines is to be guilty of moral treason
to the Republic. To hold for this
country only half an allegiance is in
reality to be hostile to this country,
for in practice when the crisis comes,
the man whose loyalty is on a 50-fi0
basis always shows that his loyalty
to the other country conies first."
Calls Women Fellow-Citizens.
Only the brief introduction to the
address was devoted to suffrage. Col
Roosevelt referred to the women as
his fellow-American citizens and urg­
ing them to work for the passage of
an amendment to the federal consti­
tution providing for suffrage.
British Private Tells His
Experience Fighting Inside
War-Famed Land Tank
WE CUMSEP OUT INTO THE TRENCH
.(This is the first story of life inside
a British "tank" in battle, told by a
soldier who was a member of a "tank"
crew, to reach this country.—Editor)
London, Oct. 26.—Here is the story
of a "tank" fight as seen "from the in­
side looking out," told by a member
of the crew of one of these farm trac­
tors that have been turned into gi­
gantic engines of death and have
spread terror and destruction over the
battle fronts of Europe!
Private (right name withheld)
took part in a tank fight during the
struggle for Flers, and was sent to a
London hospital where he told his
story to a Tribune correspondent:
"The first time I saw a tank, it was
coming down the road to the first line
trenches at Flers. Later, other tanks
came along, some looking like bis
boilers, others like armored automo­
biles, and all creeping along on cater­
pillar belts.
"I was detailed to one of them that
looked like a submarine from the in­
side. We christened it the H. M. S.
Landship and referred to its parts in
nautical terms.
"Although we knew the Landship
was going to be taken into battle, we
had no idea of its real use until the
time came.
"The only opening in the tank was
forward, through which our lieuten­
ant, at the wheel, was peering. The
guns were in and their port holes
shut. The only light in the machine
came through that little hole in front.
It was dismal and gloomy inside.
"Only the lieutenant knew where we
were going.
"The tank lurched forward, then
stopped! We heard a crunching
crushing sound as we felt the Land-j
or a a
ily. Suddenly we were terrified by a
crash above us. The din of heavy
missies showering upon the steel ar­
mor of our tank was so deadening we
stuffed up our ears.

swer what we thought was the cannon

Secretary Claims Bandit Attack
On U. S. Troops Has Been Ar­
ranged for Political Purposes.
NO AMERICANS INVOLVED
ASSERTS SEC. LANSING
Alleged That Uprising Has Been
Arranged to Swing Public
Sentiment.
Washington, Oct. 2fi—Secretary Ba­
ker issued a formal statement tonight
.saying that definite information had
been received by the war department
that a bandit attack on American
troops in Mexico, or upon an Ameri­
can border town, had been arranged
to take place between now and elec­
tion day, to create sentiment against
the administration's Mexican policy,
it adds that Generals Funston and
Pershing were forewarned and are in
readiness for the attack:
The statement follows:
"The war department has received
definite information, confirmed from
other sources, that enemies of the ad­
ministration's policy toward Mexico,
in co-operation with Villa or other
bandits in Mexico, have arranged a
spectacular attack, to be made either
upon some part of the American forc­
es or upon some American commun­
ity on the border, between now ana
the date of the election, for the pur­
pose of turning the tide of sentiment
against the policy which the adminis­
tration has adopted for the protection
of the border.
"It is significant in this connection
that both the state and war depart­
ments were advised that, the bandit
forces operating at the prpgent. time
in Mexico are being paid in silver
coin.
Full particulars have been transmit­
ted to General Funiton and "General
Pershing. All American forces are,
therefore, forewarniit aj'd in readi­
ness for such an attdiik."
No additional information could' be
obtained from Mr. Baker, who left
the city before the statement was
made public, for Martinsburg, W. Va.,
to deliver a campaign speech.
No Americans Involved,
oecretary Lansing tonight author­
ized the statement that Secretary Ba­
ker had no intention to intimate that
Americans were involved in the ban­
dit rtttack plot. The secretary said
that it had been called to his atten­
tion that an effort would be made to
construe the war department's state
inent as a political play and as an as
sault upon the administration's polit
icalopponents. He denounced such a
construction as absolutely false, de­
claring that politics were not given
a thought in connection with the mat­
ter, and that it was inconceivable that
any American would ally himself with
Mexicans to attack his own country­
men. Mr. Lansing saw the statement
before it was issued and discussed it
with Secretary Baker. He explained
that both he and Mr. Baker believed
that, in addition to warning the mili­
tary commanders, it was wise to give
the information received publicity, be­
cause it might have the effect of caus­
ing the plot to be abandoned.
Agents Receive Information.
From other sources it was learned
that information concerning a plot
had been received through agents of
the department of justice, state de­
partment representatives on the bor­
der, and also through some other
channel which has no£ been disclosed.
It is understood that no military re­
ports from the border have mentioned
the subject. The statement bears
out this, indicating that Generals
Funston and Pershing received their
first warning through advices sent to­
night by the war department.
It is stated on reliable authority,
also, that none of the evidence at
hand involves Americans, and that
Mexican interests in the United
States are believed to be directly re­
sponsible for the conspiracy with ban­
dits across the border.
The department of justice is press­
ing its investigation.
DICE FOB ALL MRKtRS
London, Oct. 26.—Replying to a de­
putation today on the subject of the
high price of food and low wages paid
shopkeeping employes in the distri­
buting trades, Walter Runciman, pres­
ident of the board of trade, made the
announcement that the government
was considering the whole question of
a minimum wage for all workers. He
added that legislation might become
necessary to deal with the sale o(
milk and that the subject of municipal
shops being established for the sup­
ply of bacon and other foodstuffs, al­
so was being considered.
Regarding the request that the gov­
ernment should take over the wheat
supply, Mr. Runciman pointed out the
difficulties created by the fact that a
large proportion of the grain comes
from abroad.

Nominee Declares He Will be
"An American President,"
If Elected.
WILL ALSO HAVE
AN ABLE CABINET
Hecklers Are Squelched When
Candidate Answers Leading
Questions Emphatically.
Boston, Mass., Oct. 26.—Charles E.
Hughes tonight told an audience
which filled Boston's big arena that
he proposed to be an American presi
ident, if elected, unswerved by any
suggestion of foreign influence.
"And I propose," he added, "that If
am elected, we shall have the ablest
cabinet that this country can supply."
Will Maintain American Rights.
Mr. Hughes also declared he would
maintain American rights and that he
would maintain American rights and
that he nad absolutely no patience
whatever with the idea that an Amer­
ican citizen, following his lawful pur­
suits, in any part of the world, should
be left unprotected by the country
from which he came.
"Is it possible that any such notion
should obtain in the shadow of Bunk­
er Hill?'' he asked.
The audience rose to its feet and.
waving thousands of American flags,
shouted in answer:
"No."
Greeted by Lasting Ovation.
Mr. Hughes had prepared his speech
In advance, and while he adhered to
It in substance, he made radical
changes of its phraseology in delivery.
He- reached the city, after two ad­
dresses at Hartford and Provident, un
tired and in excellent spirits.. The big
htidtenue gave liiin aiive minute cheer
when he entered the hall, and time af­
ter timp, interrupted him with ap­
plause and cheers during the delivery
of his speech.
Hecklers Squelched.
Hecklers sought to question him on
annus topics, and one man who per­
sisted finally made himself heard
among confusion. In doing so the
heckler had the aid of the nominee,
who sought to quiet the crowd and
urged that the questioner be allowed
to proceed.
"What specific policy will you take
in Mexico?" the heckler shouted.
"What specific policy will you take in
Europe? What are ou going to do
with the eight-hour bill? What—,"
The rest of the questioning was lost
in salvo of boos and cat-calls.
"I do not. know," Mr. Hughes re­
plied, "just what sort of mess we will
find things in Mexico next March, but
there are certain principles we shall
bo governed by. First, we will not
meddle with affairs that do not con­
cern us second, when we say we will
respect the rights of small nations,
we will respect them in reality. And
third, it shall be understood in Mexi­
co, in Latin-America, and elsewhere,
that American rights, with respect to
lives and property shall be protected."
The audience applauded and cheer­
ed. The heckler sat down and there
were no more attempts to question
the speaker.
Audience is For Candidate.
Mr. Hughes' declaration of his in­
tention to be "an American president,"
if elected, was interrupted by cheers
and applause at the conclusion of
every sentence,
"If I am elected, as I expect to be—"
he began. The audience stopped him
•with cheering and from various sec­
tions of the hall, came shouts "you
will be." "If 1 am elected, as I expect
to be," he began again, "we shall have
an American administration with ex­
clusively American policies devoted
to American interests. I propose to
be an American president unswerved
by any suggestion of foreign influ­
ence."

SAY
Death of Walter Wenberg Ap­
pears to Have Been Caused by
Abnormal Heart.
INTERRUPTED FUNERAL
WILL BE HELD TODAY
A post, mortem examination of the
remains of Walter Wenberg, made
yesterday afternoon by Drs. Roan and
Bodenstab and assistants, shed new
lifht on the causes of the young man's
death Tuesday morning.
The viscera was removed, but in the
opinion of the examiners, conditions
did not warrant shipping the stomach
and intestines to Fargo at the coun
ty's expense for an analysis of their
contents. They were held, however,
and relatives of the deceased in Brook­
lyn were communicated with to ascer­
tain whether they wished the analy­
sis made at their expense.
Yesterday's autopsy indicated that
death was due to an abnormal condi­
tion of the heart and other organs
and it is said that there were found
no grounds for suspecting that, any
other agent was responsible.
Inquest Held.
Coroner Anton Beer impaneled a
jury of three—Robert Walton, Wil­
liam Wilcox and D. C. McLean—yes­
terday morning, and the testimony of
Dr. J. O. Arnson, who last attended
the deceased, was received. The jury
then adjourned to await a report
from the post mortem. Additional
telegrams were received yesterday
from uncles of the deceased in Brook­
lyn. They indicated that the investi­
gation was instigated by the uncles
rather than by the dead man's father.
The various telegraphic messages,
which are in possession of State's At­
torney Bernda, were not introduced in
evidence.
Funeral Again Set.
Plans for the interrupted funeral
have again been made. If nothing oc­
curs to prevent, the rites will be held
at 2:30 this afternoon at the Lucas
chapel on .Main street, Rev. Harry C.
Postlethwaite, pastor of the First
Presbyterian church, will officiate. In­
ternment. will be made at Plain View
cemetery.
HUGHES' STAND ON
FLOUR EMBARGO ASKED
San Francisco. Oct. 2».—The Cali­
fornia State Master Hankers' associa­
tion telegraphed Charles K. Hughes,
Republican candidate for president,
today asking him to announce his po­
sition on a proposed wheat and flour
embargo. The association, which
raised the price of bread to six cents
a lot yesterday, began the circulation
of a petition today to President Wil­
son requesting him to declare a
wheat and flour embargo to prevent
any further exportation to European
or other countries.
Stale bread was selling here today
at three loaves for 10 cents, or four
for 1" cents. Yesterday's bread, for
years, has sold two loaves for cents
until the California Master Bakers'
association raised the price of fresh
bread from cents to cents a loaf.

Minneapolis Millers Announce
Highest Price Since Civil
War Period
Minneapolis, Minn., Oct. 26.—iFlonr
price records for half a century were
broken Wednesday, when the millers
of Minneapolis announced that flour
in car lots, on track in Minneapolis,
was $10 a barrel.
Ten-dollar flour in Minneapolis
means higher than 10 nearly every*
where else in the country.
B*ged on December Wheat.
Millers based the price on $1.95 for
December wheat, which at the high
point, today went to $1.$ 5-8, and a
premium of 4 to 6 cents for the mill­
ing grades in the cash market, and
accompanied the advices with the no­
tation that in the event of $2 being
reached for December wheat, first
patent flour, which the quotation cov­
ered, would be $10.2'i. It looked at
that time as if $2 December wheat
might be reached before the day clos­
ed. but the market at the close reced*
ed to $1.91.
Highest Since Civil War.
•Records of the old Philadelphia
flour exporting Arm of 'Bell, Sons ft
Co., of which the father of the tat*
James .S Bell, president of the Wlash*
burn-Crosby company, was a member,
show that in the period immediately
following the cloge of the Civil war
flour sold in the east at $16 a barrel.
At that, time the Minneapolis flour
prices were $12 to $14 a barrel, but
the entire milling process has chang­
