Shady, Oct. 26. -Jack Frost was
abroad Saturday night, nipping the
ears off all who were out when honest
people should have been in bed,
blighting young truck and when this
writer arose Sunday morning we did
wish the cook had some good fresh
sausage for breakfast.
One thing we hope Jack Frost kill
ed is these little pesky , malarial
germs that are causing chills and
fever, sore eyes and laziness, in our
midst Here's hoping after this we
can keep step as lively to the frosty
feeling in the air as to the most en
chanting dance music. We are need
ing rain badly and tho all' the good
old signs have failed lately we are
trusting , the change in the moon to
day and believing we are to have a
young flood. Here's hoping.
Shady has lost one of her prettiest
girls since Miss Bonnie Purvis left
us Monday to stay in Ocala with her
aunt and be nearer school.
Mr. Dewey Albertson was over
from DeLand last week to visit his

see him here often.

America, Says President Wilson, Will
Find it Impossible to Keep Out
of It -
(Associated Press) -Cincinnati,
Oct. 27. In discussing
the relations of the United States to
the European war, in an address
here yesterday- President Wilson de
clared that this was the last war that
involves the the world that the United
States can keep out of. He gave as
his reasons for this, his belief that the
business of neutrality is over and that
the war now has such a scale that the
positions of neutrals, sooner or later,
becomes intolerable. . He added that
the nations of the world must get to
gether and say that nobody can pre-
fer to be' neutral-as Tespects the dis
turbance of the world's t peace for an
object, which the world's opinion can
not sanction. , i a
After denying the Republican claim
that the business prosperity of the
United States the past two years had
been due to the war, the president
ridiculed the predictions that j. after
the war Europe would overwhelm the
United States by its economic
strength, and dump on the United
States goods which, are now being
stored for that purpose.
FLORIDA BOYS ON '
THE FRONTIER
(Plant City Courier)
Camp Florida, Laredo, Texas, Oct.s
19. Under command of Colonel Al
bert H. Blanding, of the Second Flor
ida Infantry, who is serving as com
mander of the Third Brigade in the
absence of ; Colonel Slocum, the Bri
gade left this morning at seven-thirty
o'clock for a practice march . of
twelve miles through cactus fields,
mesquite brush, alkali dust and Rio
Grande mud, a combination which
would be hard to beat in testing the
staying qualities and marching effic
iency of a body of troops. The Bri
gade is composed of , the Second
Florida infantry, the Second New
Hampshire infantry, with the Ninth
U. S. infantry attached.
The march will be "somewhere out
on the border," assuming the line of
march followed in active campaign,
with full Brigade complement, includ
ing, a -convoy and a wagon train for
each regiment. -' Although the march
is for practice and instruction, each
battalion wagon carries a case ( 12,
000 rounds) of ball cartridge rifle am
munition, conveniently placed on the
wagon for quick access and distribu
tion J in case an - emergency should
arise, such as an attack from a mar
auding band or the troops being fir
ed upon by snipers , or a detachment
of Mexican bandits. It is not 'con
templated that it will be necessary to
bring the ammunition into use, but
the lesson of preparedness has been
learned long since here in this uncer
tain and treacherous country, and on
all occasions of a body of troops go
ing, any distance from the camp a
plentiful supply of ammunition is car
ried along. In the absence of any
special maneuvers or combat problems
the Brigade should return to camp by
noon, as the march of twelve miles is
considered but a short one.
The Second Florida regiment, with
its gruelling and detailed training at
Black Point, does a little more than
"stack up well" with the other regi
ments of guard here, and is practi
cally conceded to be the best regi
ment along this stretch of the border
country. It is the largest regiment
ever stationed here, and in its drill
and effficiency it leads the others as
it does in fighting it leads the others

PARTICULARS OF THE PLAN
DUE FRECAUTIOHS TAKEH
(Associated Press)
Washington, Oct. 27. War and
state - department officials refused to
disclose the source or specific nature
of information on which Secretary
Baker last night issued a statement
charging that a bandit attack on the
American troops in Mexico or on the
border has been planned. It was said
that the channel through which the
report came was so valuable that
nothing could be given out that might
injure its usefulness. :
Secretaries Baker and Lansing laid
stress upon the statement that domes
tic politics had nothing to do with the
issuance of the stateemnt. "It will
have served its purpose if it serves
notice on the lawless people in Mexico
that we have been warned and are pre
pared," said Secretary Baker. '
Secretary Lansing, whom Secretary
Baker consulted before issuing the
statement, view the information, al-
hough indefinite as to individuals, as
showing a dangerous border situation.
BANDITS BEATEN BY COWBOYS
-Columbus, N. M., Oct. 27. A wire
eSs from the American expeditionary
headquarters in Mexico said reports
had been received there that thirty
five cowboys from Santa Ana ranch,
a Hearst property near Babricora,
had attacked and defeated a Villa de
tachment near ' Sangeronimo. Four
bandits were captured.
BAKER SEEMS TO BE TRYING TO
HEDGE
Washington, Oct. 27. Secretary
Baker announced late yesterday that
the. war department had received def
inite information that the enemies of
the government's policy towards Mex
ico, in co-operation with Villa, and
other bandits, had arranged for ' a
spectacular attack on the American
troops on the border, to be made be
fore the election in order to create
sentiment against the administration.
Full particulars of the plan, the sec
retary said, have been forwarded to
Generals Funston and Pershing and all
the American forces are in readiness
for the attack. In a statement issued,
the secretary added, that it was sig
nificant in this connection that both
state and war department advices
said that the bandit forces operating
at present in Mexico are being paid
in silver coin. -
No additional information could be
obtained from Secretary Baker, who
left the city before the statement was
made public, to deliver an address in
West Virginia. From other sources,
however, it was learned that the in
formation regarding the plot was reT
ceived from the state and justice de
parements on the border and other
sources which were not disclosed. It
is understood that no military report
from the border has mentioned the
subject.
It is also stated on reliable author
ity that none of the evidence in hand
involves any Americans and the Mex
ican interests in the United States are
believed to be directly responsible for
the conspiracy.
' Secretary Lansing authorized the
statement that Secretary Baker had
no intention of intimating that any
Americans " were involved in the ban
dit attack plot. Secretary Lansing
said his attention had been called to
the fact that an effort would be made
to construe" Baker's statement as a
political play.
IS WELL AGAIN
Mrs. L. B. Sanders returned to the
city last Saturday evening from New
Orleans, where she has been spending
the past several months, with her
daughter Mrs. Sistrunk. Mrs. Sand
ers was called to New Orleans by the
sickness of her daughter, who under
went an operation in a hospital in that
city." The many friends in this city
of Mrs. Sistrunk will rejoice to know
that she is again well and in good
health. Brooksville Argus.
