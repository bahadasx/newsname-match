NUMBER 253
KIDS CAN'T
OPERATE
CARS NOW
Matter Officially 'Threshed Out by Cil
Council and Mayor's Examining
Board is Approved
OWNERS AND CHILDREN
ARE LIABLE TO ARREST
Man Who Allows Children Under Sixteen
to Take Car Out of Garage Will
Be Hailed in Court
without a dissenting voice Mayor
Coffman's appointees to the examining
board which -will determine who shall
and who shall not bo given licenses
to drive automobiles in the city were
approved by the council last night
An examination fee of seventy-five
cents will be levied for all such 'per
mits.
The examining board will consist of
Emmett Barton, L. R. Boone aud Har
old Dipert. f-
Notwithstanding an effort which
was made by Councilman Linn to
have the age limit removed as a qual
ification for applicants for permits to
drive, the present law prescribing
penalty for any person under Bixteen
eyara to drive a car unless accompa
nied on the same seat b- - ''censed
driver ,was not amende. ' in any
way affected. It was brought but in
the discussion that sixteen and not
eighteen years was the age fixed by
(.he statutes notwithstanding the con
flicting figures inserted in the ordi
nance ledpe Councilman Linn con
" teuded that some children were better
qualified to handle automobiles than
were their elders and that many pa
rents nave become accustomed to Hav
ing thoir youngsters call for them after
, office hours. Furthermore merchants
In some instances find that they can
economize sometimes to the extent of
two or three hundred dollars by util
izing the talents and the energies of
their boys in the driving of autodeliv
erles and wagons during- vacation.
On these it would work a hardship,
he said, while in his opinion the boys
wore fully competent to operate the
cars. It would bo the duty of the ex
amining board to determine whether
of not the child's legs were long
enough to reach the various apparatus
which would place the machinery in
motiou and whether they could handle
the steering wheel.
Mayor Coffman spoke briefly but to
the point on the subject. Children
were children whether they had,
through prevailing conditions, learned
to pperate cars or not. They had not
the judgmont of grown people. ' It
was not merely the knowledge of di
recting an anfombbile along a clear
road which Bhbuld deferwt'no a driv
er's competency, but rather the jucig-
nt which he should exercise in mo
ments of actual peril. ! In this a child
was deficient, in his opinion. Anoth
er argument which should exclude
them from handling these powerful
machines was that under the statutes
they are not liable for accidents as
are persons over sixteen. It' would
not be just to place this power for
evil in thoir hands without having
handy a remedy to apply in case of its
(iiisuse. That was the dangerous
phase of the situation. There is no
law under which children can be pun
ished in case of accidents and. under
those conditions they should not be
allowed to run cars at large.
Councilman Hayes admitted that
'jthore were many boys who drove cars
nd who drove them well. But these
jare 4boys just the same without the
.heads of grown-ups.
I City Attorney Grigsby placed a hy
pothetical case before the council
feuppose a fourteen-year-old boy should
lose his head while driving a car and
kill a whole, "amily, "his own fir anoth
rr, what remedy could be applied un
ficr the law? Absolutely none.'
Then Councilman Caneman cinched
the whole proposition by declaring
hhat there was no use .in talking, a
jhild under sixteen is a child ana has ,
...... i
iot sense enough w meet emergen
jcies. An automobile is an engine of
big horsepower and no child would be
permitted to handle it. What manu
facturer would risk as large an engine
Jn thb hands of a child with the same
4i.sk of loss of life involved in its mis-
management?
The resolution, lu effect as follows,
was passed with an emergency clause;
The ordinance provides that no per
son shall run ail automobile within the
city of Chlckasha without first obtain
ing a recommendation or statement
from the examining hoard and shall
pay seventy-five cents for such exam
ination. A ponalty not exceeding 2J
la attached and the ordinance becomes
effective after its publication, carrying
the emergency clause.
Muyor Coffman expluined that any
body with a license could teach an
other how to drive but that in some
Instances several members of a family
operated the same car. Each of these
would have to procure a separate
cense.
li
Not only the child who drives an au
tomoblle without sanction of the law
but the owner of the car who permits
it will be subject to arrest, Mayor Coff
man said today.

NEWTON'S
JURY NOW
7-4 AND 1
Judge Jones Calls in Twelve Men at Noon
to Ascertain Probability of Reach
ing Conclusion
ELOQUENT APPEAL
MADE BY BAREFOOT
Six Men on Jur? Melt to Tears When
Attorney for Defense Presents Case
ot Accused Banker
After deliberating for nearly twenty
four hours the jury in the case of W,
A. Newton, charged with embezzle
ment, reported the status of their de
liberations to Judge Cham Jones
shortly before noon today. The fore
mail said they had had a hard tima
getting together and had made little
progress. The jurors at present, he
said, stood seven to four with one
member not voting.
The jury was brought in by Bailiff R.
Lindsay and returned again to
their quarters in the county jail
building.
The conviction is gaining ground
that the trial will result either in the
acquittal of Newton or a hung jury
At one time during the maiterly pre
sentation of the defense by Attorney
B. B. Barefoot Bix of the jurors were
melted to tears and sympathy for the
defendant was in evidence in the largi
audience which assembled In the dis
trict court room.
Omitting the oratory and his hear
ers Mr. Barefoot took up the history
of the banking conditions which pre
vailed at Rush Springs and conditions
surrounding this ca.se, showing that
Newton had been connected with the
bank for two or three years and had
been en extremely popular man in the
community up to the time when these
proceedings had been instituted
gainst him. That immediately upon
the merger; of the Farmers Mer
chants bank; id the State bank an
effort was made on the part of cer
tain men' to get control of the stock
to the detriment of stockholders or
the Farmers aud Merchants bank,
which also meant the elimination of
Newton as cashier.
He charged persecution in the
bringing of an auditor from Dallas to
audit Newton's books and that whll-
tho bank claimed a shortage of $7200
witness on the stand admitted that
in this calculation an error of $-3400
h '.r! V-c".u made. The attorney declar
ed the directors had confiscated
300 worth of bank stock belonging to
Newton which would have completely
overcome any overdraft wh h Newton
may have made on his private account.-
' It was then shown that the matter
between ton and the Bentleys was
a private transaction outside of the
jurisdiction ot the bank. Newton, he
pointed out, had tried to pay back the
$1054.11 which he held
in trust for
them but Mr. Bentley had refusrfd to
accept it on advice of the bank's offi
cials. Newton was now ready and willing
to pay back to the Bentleys th sum
in which he was indebted to him and
would sottle this matter ina manner
satisfactory to the Bentley? if given
anopportunity to do so.

WARNJNG
TO MEXICO
Secretary Baker's Statement Was Meant
to Put Carranza Government on
Notice for Better Conditions
STRIFE STIRRED TO
AFFECT POLITICS
American Army Forewarned that Plotters
oa American Side Plan Attack to
Reflect on Wilson's Administration
By United Press.
Washington, Oct, 27. Secretary of
War Baker announced this morning
that he may make another statement
later in regard to his charge that a
plot exiuts to produce an armed con
flict between this country and Mexico.
Administration officials said Ba
ker's statement was intended as a
warning to the Mexican government
and a guarantee of the good faith of
the United States government. The
administration expects the Carranza
government to take final and effec
tive measures for the suppression of
banditry.
Secretary Baker returned today
from Martinsburg, W. Va., where he
spoke last night. His own belief and
that of other administration officials
was expressed in the startling state
ment which ho Issued last night. By
making public its knowledge of the
danger seriously threatening the rela
tions between the United States and
the Carranza govomient, the adminis
tration expects to make Carranza ful
ly realize this government's unselfish
purpose and In consequence hopes for
more active co-operation between the
military forces of lliV tr countries
for common action against 'Mexican
bandits.
Should the Mexican government Ig
nore the opportunity thus presented
and fail to bring about better condi
tions in Mexico, there is reason to be
lieve that the American government
will seriously consider independent ac
tion toward thut end. Baker's state
ment is also expected to have an im
portant effect In checking the report
ed conspiracy on the American side
of tho border.
While no definite statement could
be obtained the impression was given
that the alleged conspiracies wero be
ing furthered by Mexican eientifieos
of the Diaz regime and their agents
who have headquarters in several Urge
eastern cities and border towns. Ba
ker's statemont, Issued last night, was
as follows:
'The war department has received
definite information confirmed from
other sources, that enemies of tho ad
ministration's policy towards Mexico,
I" co-operation with Villa or other ban
dits in Mexico, have arranged a spec
tacular attack to be made either upon
some part of the Amercan forces or
upon some American community on
the border between now and the date
if the election for tho purpose of
turning the tide of sentiment against
the policy which the administration
had adopted for the protection of tho
