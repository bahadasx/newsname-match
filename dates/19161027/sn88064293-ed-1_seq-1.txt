Me Insuring Public
The trouble and expenses incur
red by the Local Insurance Agents,
because of their inability to collect
their premiums, and the frequent
losses by non-payments has become
so much of a tax on their business
that they have found it necessary to
limit all credit for premiums to 60
days from date of policy. Hereafter,
satisfactory settlement must be made
within that time, otherwise the policy
will be cancelled, for such non-pay
ment.

You can get married by The Wes

mony was recently performed by

Texas and the bride in a city in
Ohio. The account reads romantic,
j The groom who is said to be a mem
Ohio National Guard,
stationed near Laredo, found himself
on the border protecting American
territory when his wedding day ap
proached. He accompanied a minist
er to witness to the Telegraph office
at Laredo, while the bride did like
wise in Ohio. A direct wire was cut
through from Laredo to Hamilton,
Ohio, and in the usual time that it
takes to perform the ceremony, the
couple were made man and wife.
The ceremony was unique in every
way.

Culverts for Roads Across Swamps
Many of the roads of Louisiana
cross bayous where the swampy con
ditions are verv troublesome ai.J
render any of the usua. types of con- J
struction undesirable.Theswamys are
often so deep that the cost of foun
dations for a bridge or masonry
structure of anv kind would be very
great in c imparison with the .:.,ual
expense of this work. At one of
these bayous, for instance, a scant
ling 2 inches square and 16 feet long
was pushed down into the mud for
I.
its full length without encountering
any appreciable resistance. This
particular bayou was 250 feet wide
and the water in it was 25 feet deep
in places, but the current was very
slight and the only use of a culvert
was to maintain the water at the
same height on each side of the road.
To meet this condition, an earth em
bankment was constructed out from
each bank to carry the roadway, and
a corrugated iron pipe 6 feet in dia
meter was laid across it below the
water level. Such a culvert is called
an equalizer by State Highway En
gineer Atkinson, who employs this
method of meeting such swamps
drainage conditions, because its pur
pose is primarily to equalize the
water level on each side of the em
bankment rather than to drain a
tract of wet land.
Neuralgia of the face, shbulder,
