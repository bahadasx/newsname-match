Sixty University women have
pledged themselves to support the
cause of equal suffrage and to spread
Its influence throughout the Univer

state university to join the National
College of Equal Suffrage League,
which is affiliated with the National
Suffrage Association. About twenty
fiva schools 'and universities arc rep

school' 'year, the college leaguo was
founded here,, but no definite plans
were made.
The league last night made the de
cision to begin work' at once, accord
ing to the principles of the national
league. These plans are to get all
college women, including alumnae, in
terested in suffrage and to enlarge the
scope by interesting all local womenr
especially as to the signficance of the
federal amendment.
Each meeting of the University
branch will be conducted by the
members themselves, and a program
will be given each time. In addition,
a speaker of national importance,
sent by the national headquarters,
will address one meeting of the year.
These meetings will be held at 7
o'clock every other Thursday night.
Miss Mary Robertson is president
of the club. Other officers are: Sec
retary and treasurer, Miss Gladys
Baker; assistant treasurers, Misses
Thelma Gwinn and Loretta Funke.
Misses Lois Hodges, Helen Redding
and Clara Dunn are members of the
board.
One graduate of the University, Miss
Alma Sasse, has been active in na
tional suffrage work for more than a
year. Most of her time has been spent
in West Virginia, where she has con
ducted suffrage campaigns. She has
nnw gone to Washington to help there

Rnmor of Change of Location De
niedMust Remain Here.
There has been some talk through
out the state to the effect that Ste
phens College would be moved from
Columbia to Liberty. This was based
upon the report P. W. Padelford, sec
retary of the Northern Baptists As
sociation, made last winter after visit
ing Missouri. Mr. Padelford suggest
ed that all the Baptist schools for
girls be centered at Liberty. No ac
tion has ever been taken on this sug
gestion. E. W. Stephens, member of the
Board of Curators of Stephens Col
lege, told a Missourian reporter this
morning that there is no probability,
nor even possibility, that the location
of Stephens College will be changed.
"The charter calls for 'the school to
be at Columbia," said Mr. Stephens;
''the gifts have been made to the col
lege on condition that the school be
here, and the consent of the board
would have to be obtained before any
change could be made."
That the Board of Curators has
found that Mrs. Martin deserved a
special claim on account of the pur-never considered changing the loca
chase price of some land, amounting tion ' the school was affirmed both
to $350. This was ordered to be paid
in cash to the plaintiff.
Court ended this afternoon with the
Estes case. The next term of Circuit
Court begins the first Monday in
January.
GOOD WEATHER FOR THE WHEAT
Although Some of it Is Late the Crop
Will Winter WclL
"The late rains and fair weather
will allow the farmers to get their
wheat in excellent shape," says J. M.
Jordan, institute lecturer of the State
Board of Agriculture. "Although
some of the wheat is a little late, it
will still grow through the winter in
pretty good condition. Two dollars a
bushel for wheat Is mighty attractive.
Even the fine hog prices do not make
farmers hog hungry when they get
$1 a bushel for their corn, too."
1,100 Old Gnard Buttons Sold.
Eleven hundred old guard buttons
have been sold by thj Student Council.
The proceeds are $135.
by Mr. Stephens and by W. W. Char
ters, president of the board.
A change in the manner of choosing
the members of the Board of Curators
was made at the recent convention of
the Missouri Baptists Association at
Liberty. Formerly members of the
board were selected by the Missouri
Baptists Association, but in accord
ance with a report made by Doctor
Charters the board will henceforth he
a self-perpetuating body. "This and
a few other changes suggested by
Doctor Charters," Mr. Stephens said,
"are to make. our charter similar to
that of William Jewell.
"When Stephens was founded the
Intention was to make Stephens the
state college for girls just as William
Jewell is the state college for boys.
But the charters read differently in
that William Jewell's Board of Cura
tors Is a self-perpetuating body. The
change", which was approved by the
Missouri Association and was not op
posed at all, we think makes the man-

Prof. J. W. Marden Gives Analyses
Showing Wortblessness of Many.
How the unknowing and credulous
public is exploited by unscrupulous
vendors of patent remedies was ex
plained by Prof. J. W. Marden of the-
chemistry department of the Univer
sity in a lecture on "Proprietary,
Medical and Toilet Preparations" be
fore the Schweitzer Chemical Society
last night ' J'
The speaker based his lecture on
the results of analyses made by H. E.'
Barnard of the Indiana Department of
Food and 'Drug Inspection. These
analyses covered many patent prepa
rations, ranking all the- way from a
"hog conditioner," retailing at $5 and
valued at 60 cents, to a concoction to
"make the eyebrows long and silky,'"
selling for $1 and valued at 3 cents.
A bulletin''containing the name of
the preparation, Its manufacturer,
claims, analysis, price, and value may
be obtained upon application to Mr.
Barnard at Indiapolis, Ind. Professor
Marden, who formerly had charge of
one of the laboratories under the Mis
souri Department of Food and Drug
Inspection, confirmed many of these
analyses. k'
In an effort to get better movies
for children the Lee School Mothers'
Club, with the co-operation of the
other Mothers Clubs and the Civic
League, have guaranteed the Odeon,
the only local theater willing to sup
port the movement, a sale of 600 tick
ets for thirteen weeks at 65 cents
each, which averages 5 cents a per
formance. The program will be of
especial interest to children, as na
ture films and a series of "Uncle
Sam" pictures, showing the different
wJork done by the U. S. government,
will be shown. All of the pictures
will be educational except a comedy
which will be given occasionally. The
pictures will be offered on Saturday
afternoons.
Mrs. L. d. Haigh said the main dis
advantage to the pictures offered here,
is that they are written for adults
only. Giving the wrong conception of
life to children, they do not satisfy
their desires.
"When all the knowledge comes
through the five senses and 90 per
cent through the eyes, certainly the
mothers of Columbia should demand
better pictures for their children,"
said Mrs. W. F. Harshe of the Civic
League, a guest of the club. "By
law," she continued, "a picture too
obscene cannot be shown, but after all
it is public opinion that sets the
mark."
"The greatest advantage to the us
ual pictures offered is that they are
the worst enemy of the saloon and
yet when the small child sees the
'vililan' take a drink to steady his.
nerves, he Is apt to remember it It
may influence him in later life," said
Mrs. P. F. Trowbridge. She advo
cated more of the Lyman-Howe na
ture films and pictures of geograph
ical and historical interest.
Mrs. C. L. Brewer, president of the
club, said she had discussed the pic
ture problem with several University
students and that they had promised
their co-operation. Since the last
meeting of the club eighteen new
members have been added. The next
meeting will be November 2C.
