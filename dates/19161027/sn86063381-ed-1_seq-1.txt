THE BEMlBJIliikllj
By George P. Anthier.
(Special to the Pioneer)
Chicago, Oct. 27.Just as the ad
herents of Woodrow Wilson are con
gratulating themselves that they have
lulled the public into forgetfulness
of the Underwood tariff law before
the war intervened, to save the coun
try from the consequences of that
folly, comes a report from Peoria,
111., which strikingly illustrates the
unprotected condition of American in
dustry and American agriculture. Ac
cording to that report, a million
bushels of Argentine corn have been
dumped on the Peoria market, and
co-incident with that report the mar
ket price dropped.
While the farmers of the North
west have been reveling in $2.00
wheat there has been an under-cur
rent of realization that this was a
temporary condition, and that the
close of the European war would
throw that section of the country
wide op(|i to the competition of Can
ada. The competition that may come
from Australia, Russia and the Ar
gentine has not been so seriously
considered as that from Canada, but
the Wilson managers had hoped that
the great corn belt section would be
undisturbed. Apparently there was
no danger of competition in the field
occupied by King Corn. Just at this
moment comes the burst of the bomb
in connection with the Peoria corn
shipment. Peoria is the center of the
corn section of the United States. It
senses corn values and knows where
the cheapest product may be ob
tained.
Can Shin Cheaper.
The report that a million bushels
of the Argentine product was dump
ejd Jn one shipment on the market is
given additional force by the fact
that a million bushels had already
been used in the manufacture of glu
cose. The fact that it is cheaper to
ship Argentine corn to Peoria at this
time than it is to buy American corn
is made the more remarkable on ac
count of war conditions. Ocean
freight rates have gone sky-rocket
ing, and the shipment of products
from foreign countries is almost pro
hibitive, except in case of actual
necessity.
When the war closes these condi
tions will not prevail. Freight ship
ments will be reduced to a normal
level, and if it is possible to ship
Argentine corn into the United States
at a time when freight charges dfe
almost prohibitive it can easily be
seen there will be a tremendous in-

dent of this city, has been arrested
and is now in jail in Tearkana, Tex.,
charged with the murder of Albert
Schraeder, another Crookston man,
who was shot to death at his home

The arrest of Thompson has caused
a sensation in this city as he was an

period of time.
WALKER WHITESIDE IN
"THE MELTING POT"
Million Bushels O
Argentine Cor Sold
In Peoria, Illinois
Walker Whiteside will be seen to
night at the Grand theater in "The
Melting Pot," Israel Zangwill's fa
mous drama which enjoyed such a
protracted run in legitimate theaters
a number of years ago. The play re
volves around one unfortunate suf
ferer, a talented young Russian Jew,
who saw his parents killed in a mas
sacre and who escaped from the
bloodthirsty mob and came to Am
erica.
In this country he earns a liveli
hood by playing a violin at a cafe,
where he attracts the attention of
a young Russian girl, the daughter
of an official of the czar. On account
of sympathizing with the persecuted
Jews, she was exiled to America by
her father, and in this country she
busied herself with settlement work.
The young couple are strangely
drawn together by their mutual love
for music, and, despite their differen
ces in religion, find themselves fall
ing desperate in love with each other.
But objection arises from various
sources to their marriage. The young
man's aunt, with whom he lives, ob
jects to a Gentile entering her home,
while the girl's father, who had been
summoned to this country by a jeal
ous suitor, is equally opposed to a
Jewish son-in-law.
Other complications develop, but
in the end, after both the hero and
heroine suffer tortures of mind and
heart and enjoy the success which
the violinist attains with his own
composition, they find happiness in.

flux of the same product when the
war ceases.
The Underwood tariff law calmly
places corn on the free list. Just as
President Wilson, with literary em
phasis, proposed that American busi
ness men shall compete with their
wits with the rest of the world, so
American farmers are told they can
compete in the same manner. Just
as industrial conditions in America
are different from those of Europe
and the Orient, so farming conditions
are different in the Argentine. In
stead of the,small farm there are
large estates operated with cheap la
bor imported from Southern Europe.
American farmers cannot compete
with these conditions. This new
situation is recognized in the South.
Municipal docks are being prepared
in New Orleans to handle this im
mense traffic. Elevators with capa
city of 60,000 bushels a day are al
ready constructed, and it is an
nounced that the city of New Orleans
is prepared to build additional eleva
tors if they are required.
Invasion a Fact.
The invasion of Argentine corn is
an accomplished fact, and the raiser
of American corn, and the grower of
American wheat must make up their
minds to face this competition when
the war closes without the aid of any
protection in the way of tariff du
ties. This invasion by Argentine
corn is not the only evidence that
America is wholly unprotected
against the war that will come after
the war. Europe and Asia are pre
paring for this struggle. Economical
alliances will follow the alliances for
war Tariff unions and customs re
prisals will be adopted. The govern
ments of Europe and that of Japan
will use their power over natural re
sources, industrial capacity, financial
ability, merchandising genius and
shipping tonnage to subdue the neut
ral markets of the world.
The prosperity that exists in Am
erica today is not entirely due to the
manufacture of munitions. The war
has built an automatic tariff wall
which holds the immense market of
America to a large degree for itself.
When the war Closes our foreign
markets will be cut off and our dom
estic markets will be captured by a
competing world. In the long run it
is probably more important that the
American people should recover from
the spiritual debauchery of the last
four years and learn once more to
wear their souls on straight, but self
interest necessarily merges into pat
riotism, and self interest prompts a
realization of the disaster that is im
pending if the authors of the present
tariff law remain in power.
CEMENT ASS'N.
REPRESENTATIVE
INSPECTINGSTREETS
K. R. Wyllie, a member of the
highway engineering staff of the
Portland Cement association, is in
Bemidji today for the purpose of
making an examination of our streets
and roads.
One of the most extensive and sci
entific studies ever made of any type
of road is being conducted by this as
sociation of all the concrete roads
in the United States. The reports
are made on specially prepared
blanks so that they will all be of
uniform character and will present
the information in the most concise
form. This information will be tab
ulated and studied so that all of the
various methods that have been used,
those that have been given the best
results can be noted.
The Portland Cement association,
with offices and engineers scattered
throughout the country, will then
be in a position to advise officials
and communities building concrete
roads as to those methods which have
proved most successful.
The significance of this undertak
ing can be partially appreciated when
it is realized that it includes a criti
cal examination of upwards of sev
enty million square yards of concrete
pavement, or nearly 7,000 miles of
18-foot road.
The Portland Cement association
in undertaking this work exhibits a
broad minded policy, which will re
sult in not only good to itself but
be of value to every taxpayer inter
ested in having the most reliable
methods of construction used in the
streets and roads for which he is
taxed. SUPREME COURT

Washington, Oct. 27.Secretary
of War Baker today announced that
he would have another statement to
make later on a charge of a plot
which exists to produce an armed
conflict between the United States
and Mexico. Administration officials
say that Baker's statement made last
night was intended as a warning to
the Mexican government.
In his statement last night Baker
said that the war department had re
ceived definite information that the
enemies of the government's policy
toward Mexico, in connection with
Villa or other bandits, had arranged
for a spectacular attack on American
troops on the border.
Full particulars of the plans, the
secretary said, had been forwarded to
Generals Funston and Pershing, and
all the American forces are in readi
ness for the attack.
Mr. Baker issued this statement:
"The war department has received
definite information, confirmed from
other sources, that enemies of the ad
ministration's policy toward Mexico,
in co-operation with Villa or other
bandits in Mexico, had arranged a
spectacular attack to be made either
upon some part of the Aemican forces
or upon some American community
on the border between now and the
date of the election for the purpose
of turning the tide of sentiment
against the policy which the admin
istration has adopted for the protec
tion of the border.
"It is significant in this connection
that both the state and war depart
ments were advised that the bandit
forces operating at the present time
in Mexico are being paid in silver
coin.
Generals Warned.
"Full particulars have been trans
mitted to General Funston and Gen
eral Pershing. All American forces
are therefore forewarned and in
readiness for such an attack."

"That's a fair question," he an
swered, "and I'll tell you immedi
ately.
"If I had been president I would
have carried on the government on
such a different basis from the too
proud to fight standard that there
would have been no trouble." He
repeated that he would have seized
every interned German ship immedi
ately after the Flaba and Gulflight
incidents and then let the Germans
bargain with them how much he
should concede them instead of bar
gaining with them.
"In Mexico I would have put Leon

just as we did in Cuba, to avoid
trouble if he could, but if he couldn't
not to slap anybody's wrist. And if
there was war, when it was over it
would be over. As it is, peace still

COUNTY AUDITOR
HOLDS UP DITCH
CONTRACTAWARDS
FOR TEN DAYS FOR
INVESTIGATION
J. L. George Postpones Action on
Ditch Number 25 Questions
Brought Up.
RESIDENTS PROTEST
AGAINST BIG DITCH
Many Contractors Submit Bids
Charges Made That Ditch is Too
Wide and Deep.
J. L. George, county auditor, today
opened bids for the construction of
Judicial Ditch No. 25, and although
the bids submitted were a reason
able charge, he decided to postpone
the awarding of the contracts until
he had investigated several questions
that arose at the contract letting.
It was brought out at the contract
letting by a prominent citizen that
the ditch was to be constructed too
wide and too deep in several cases.
Other charges were also made. Mr.
George will carefully investigate the
charges before he decides on a con
tract award.
The ditch is to be constructed
north of Red Lake. It will be 324
miles in length. The cost was esti
mated at $406,769.
Protest is Made.
When County Auditor George open
ed the bids this morning a protest
was made by a committee of citizens
of the eounty. -E. L. Oberg, editor^
of the Blackduck American, repre
sented the committee. He read a
resolution urging that the letting-or
the ditch be postponed until' after"
the legislature meets when it is ex
pected the ditch law will be amend
ed. The following composed the com
mittee: E. L. Oberg, S. W. Ellis, J.
C. Thompson, county commissioner,
James M. Reed, I. W. Langaard of
Blackduck, L. Latteral of Kelliher
and William Fellows of Tenstrike.
The resolution presented to the
auditor this morning was unanimous
ly passed at a mass meeting held at
Blackduck recently. It follows:
Whereas, the obnded indebted
ness of Beltrami county, in our
opinion, has already exceeded
the safety limit and can only be
increased by placing an exces
sive valuation on property
Whereas, grave doubt exists
as to whether the drained lands
will be taken up by actual set
tlers to insure the maintainance
of the ditches without taxing
the whole county for such main
tainance, and
Whereas, the outlet is insuffi
cient to carry off the water
from the ditches already built,
and lastly,
Whereas the tax rate of this
county is already the highest of
any in the state,
We respectfully request the
County Auditor and County En
gineer to postpone the letting of
said Ditch No. 25 until the
drainage problem shall have
come before the State Legisla
ture.
Facine Litigation.
Mr. Oberg explained that the citi
zens were not blaming anyone for the
condition of affairs but that they be
lieved that the present ditch should
be halted until the present legisla
ture convenes. He stated that the
county faces litigation as a result of
several ditches and that it had been
reported that damage suits were be
ing started.
Mr. George explained that he had
already opened and rejected bids on
the same ditch two times. He stated
that the bonds for the construction
of the ditch had been sold, but that
they had not been issued.
About 30 men, contractors and
men interested in the ditching, were
present at the bid opening this morn
ing.
The companies who submitted bids
were The American Drainage com
pany, Northwestern Drainage com
pany, Lawrence Construction com
pany, J. C. Parker & company, O. H.
Dierks, W. J. Gleason Company, Koh
ler Construction company, Thomas &
Jones of Warroad and E. A. Dahl &
