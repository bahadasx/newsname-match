Goods Roads a
Personal Responsibility
Perhaps no other feature of civil
reform or improvements of recent
years has attracted so much attention
as has that of road building.
All over our broad land, from
ocean to ocean, from the fakes to the
gulf, the wave of enthusiasm is roll
ing. The people are realizing that
they must have better roads, and the
machinery of government in its tax
ing capacity is being ever more and
more strained to meet this demand.
But while there is a certain re
sponsibility resting upon the state in
the maintenance cf our highways,
we are in danger of forgetting that an
even greater responsibility rests upon
us, individually, as cistizens. The
reason why we sometimes lose sight
of this responsibility is that we
Americans have gotten into the hab
it of working out all such matters
through the medium of taxation. If
we want a nw road opened we
levy a tax. If we want an old road
macadamized, we tax some more. Is
a bridge to be built? We impose
another tax. We tax . and we keep
on taxing, and this regardless' of the
fact that we all know that the hard
est money to give up is that which is
paid in taxes. Many a man will
come to town and spend in a day
enough to pay his yearly taxes and
think nothing of it. But he will
sweat drops of blood, as it were,
when the tax gather rounds him up.
We depend too much upon taxes.
We should depend more upon in
dividual and personal effort. A lively
neighborhood interest in good roads
is worth all of th: taxes you can
wring from unwilling pocketbooks.
A determination by a united citizen
ship of a county that their roads shall
excel is worth more than all of the
road commissioners in existence.
Road commissioners work through
devious ways to reach the their ob
ject. The united sentiment of a peo
ple works direct to the object. It de
termines what is wanted and then
takes the most direct route to accom
plish its ends.
Do you favor better roads m this
community? Then go to work and
arouse a healthy community senti
ment that will demand them. When
that is accomplished good roads will
be the result,
And just a few woids more. Real
ize your own responsibility. Say to
yourself, "the roads of this commun
ity belong partly to me, and I owe 1
duty to them." Don't depend upon a
benevolent government, national,
state, county or township, but
shoulder your own responsibility.
Then you will be in a fair way to get
your neighbor to do likewise.
Try it!

Enormous Increase
In Copper Values
The El Paso Morning Times
has the following to say in regard
to the copper mining industry in.
Grant county N. M. :
Never before in tho history of
tho copper mining industry has
there been suoh a demand for oro
whichhas advanced from He per
pound to 28 cents and is still
climbing higher. The output of
Grant county N. M. where tho
Forest Qaeen Copper Co. mines
are located five years ago was
about $100,000. Last year 1015
the value of tho output was over
twenty million dollars and tho
present year it is estimated that
the output will be moro thau
doubled. One copper company
"Ohino" is producing fifteen
millions annually. This mine
handles over 8,000 tons of ore
daily. Tho Phelps -Doge mine
3,000 tons daily producing in ex
cess of five million dollars year
ly. The Empire Zinc Compauy
has two large mills one at Han
over handling 150 tons daily and
worth $8,000 and a 800 ton Mill
in the Cleveland groupe of mines
producing iu excess of $5,000
daily or about two million annual
ly. This mine joins tho Red
Cross mine owned by the Forest
Queen Copper Co. and has the
same veins of ore. It is confi
dently predicted that within two
years time the Rjd Cross will bo
in tho same class as the property
mentioned above. This property
bids fair to be one of the best ia.
