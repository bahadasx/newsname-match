THE CALDWELL TRIBUNE, OCTOBER 27, 1916.
WEEKLY. $2.00 PER YEAR
SECOND IDAHO IS AGAIN
COMMENDED BY
ARMY OFFICERS
Camp Stephen Little, Nogales, Ari
zona, Oct. lb.—The tirst ot last week
the Second Idaho regiment returned
from a con. bat exercise of several
days' duration, during which time a
very interesting "problem'' was work
ed out and "all unbeknownst" to them,
they proved to the watchful eye of
Col. Butts, who has charge ot the
training of the troops in this district,
that they were ready to "graduate. 1
The colonel was very kind in his
official report. "Never in all my ex
perience," said he in talking to a
group ot officers, "have 1 seen a regi
ment of infantry "hike" as did the
Second Idaho on this exercisè. They
kept well closed up, preserved order
and silence, and made really wonder
lul time. The discipline was perfect
and there was no straggling at any
time.
"In my last report to General
Plummer i recommended the Idaho
boys as being ready for line guard— 1
ready to relieve the 12th regiment in
guarding the international line. Not
only did 1 make that statement, but
1 recommended them as ready to
aross th e border when needed."
To a captain of a Canyon county
company Col. Butts expressed him
self still more forcibly. "1 not only
think you can perform the line^guard
as well as do the regulars, but I think
you can do better."
That the recommendation was given
due weight is evidenced by the fact
that we are now doing the actual
work. Sunday the regiment relieved
the 12th infantry and the schedule is
for us to perform the duty five days
and alternate with the regulars every
five days—five days on and five days
off.
No Home, Sweet Home for Us.
In the opinion of most of the offi
cers, this means we will be kept here
for some time. The 12th regiment has
been an duty for nearly three years
and welcome the relief from continu
ous service. It is possible that we will
learn the minimum term of service
for our regiment in the next week or
ten days. No one can tell just when
we will be ordered home, but it is
thought that the higher officials will
be able to name the minimum—
whether it will be three months or a
year. The boys will be glad to be re
lieved of the uncertainty.
Overcoats have been issued and
woolen underwear is on the way here
now. Arrangements will soon be
made to put floors and wooden frames
in all the squad tents, as well as
heaters.
Seven large pyramidal tents now
grace the officers row on top of the
hill just west of camp, in which the
officers have their families—and more
are planning to build. Mrs. Pittenger,
wife of Capt. Pittenger of the hos
pital corps, and daughter, arrived from
Boise this week. Mrs. Dan Banks
came last week and is enthusiastic
over her new quarters.
Caldwell 6. Buhl 0.
With the tang ot the October air
comes the pigskin oval, and the first
game of the season resulted in a vic
tory for Company G. The score was
G Co., 6; K Co., 0. The 12th Inf. com
pany has cleaned everything in this
section and the Second Idaho is now
busy organizing a regimental team to
do a little cleaning themselves. Equip
ment will be ordered at once and the
squad out to make the team is busy
every day. Some very promising ma
terial has reported—stars from sev
eral of the northwestern states.
Capt. Wilson, who was shot by a
Mexican soldier a short time ago, is
up and able to hobble around. It is
probable that he will be able to make
Iiis trip home in the near future. Ten
officers of the regiment may now ob
tain a 30-day leave at one time—and
many applications arc in.
Sympathy With the Tribune.
Considerable comment was heard
the past week at the news of the ar
rest of the editor of The Tribune.
Offiocrs and men of Canyon county
express sympathy'with Mr. Davis and
indignation at the flagrant perversion
of ordinary justice as well as the
callous manner in which it was ac
complished. Those acquainted with
the case are surprised that even such
a man as Griffith should have the
temerity to attempt such a high
handed procedure, and more than sur
prised to learn that there are enough
men of his stripe among the officials
of Canyon county to enable his dis
graceful plan to be carried through.
They are with The Tribune to a man
and it is their confident hope that the
voters of the county will remember
his last insult on election day.
Bates Made Sergeant.
Ellis Bates, son of Mark Bates of
the Parma Herald, was made a full
fledged sergeant the first of the week
Bates made good at the College of
Idaho, being one of the best men in
athletics and he has continued his
record with Co. G. John M. Tooth
man, formerly instructor of manual
training in the Caldwell high school,
was by his own request reduced to the
ranks in order that he might perfect
himself in the school of the soldier.
Toothman was mess sergeant and
found his duties did not allow him suf
ficient time for drill.
Sergt. Chas. Thurston has now as
sumed the duties of mess sergeant and
is giving excellent satisfaction in thts
difficult position. Charles Harding
was promoted to the rank of corporal.
Two Democrats—Bates and Harding—
promoted by a Republican captain!
Lt. Cliurcn lias been transierred
trom Co. G to Co. K.—tlie i>uiil com
pany—so at present tlie Caldwell com
pany has only two oiucers, Capt.
tsanks and L,t. Webb.
CALDWELL DEFEATS
PAYK 'i 'iE IN luuSE GAMfc
Caldwell high school deieated Pay
ette on their home tield last Satur
day m a loosely played game. The
boys were somewhat bewildered dur
ing the hrst quarter by th e type ol
game put up by the fayette eleven,
they opened the. play by a series of
I-:.- anu torward passes most
ot which were successful. Caldwell
did well enough when they were able
to secure the ball, but they were re
Pieatedly penalized for holding and
off side playing and as a result they
failed to score in the first quarter.
Caldwell Tightens.
The second quarter the Caldwell
machine tightened up the loose spots
slightly. i'hey seemed able to get
away for good gains most any time,
but the total of the penalties they re
ceived was almost as great as their
gains. Off side line playing and hold
ing caused the set backs. In spite of
this Caldwell succeeded in getting
away for a touch down. They failed
to kick goal.
In the next quarter Cook caught a
forward pass and ran 90 yards for a
touch down and in the last quarter
Cook place kicked the oval midway
between the goals from the 35 yard
line, leaving the score at the end of
the game 16 to 0. for Caldwell.
Game Dissatisfies Houghton.
Coach Hougton was very much
displeased with the style of playing
presented by Caldwell. He says that
the excessive penalties were just—and
that Caldwell learned a good lesson
in staying on side and holding in the
line. During the entire game Cald
well was penalized nearly 300 yards
which the coach declares accounts for
Caldwell's undecisive victory.
Baker to Be Here Saturday.
Baker City defeated Caldwell by one
point last year. The game was the
first in the season for each. Baker
still has many of last year's men on
their team. Ln spite of this Cald
well expects to give the Oregonians
the tiff of their lives. This week's
practices are bringing out the fight
and snap in Caldwell's eleven that has
missed fire heretofore. Caldwell does
not expect an easy game. They ex
pect to have to fight the hardest to
make a good showing in this game
of any in the schedule. The game will
start at 3 o'clock sharp.
New Lunch Room.
A new lunch room is being installed
in the basement of the Van Buren
building, which will also be used for
a play room during stormy weather.
A like arrangement having been made
in the Washington school during the
summer, gives each of the ward
buildings a suitable place for lunching.

BRYAN OVERRULES THE
DEMURRER IN STONE
TAÜPPEAL CASE
The demurrer filed by H. A. Grif
liths, prosecuting attorney of Canyon
county, to the appeal ol Alfred F.
Stone, in the matter of the wholesale
employment of lawers by Mr. Grif
fiths to assist in the tax cases, has
been overruled by Judge Ed L. Bryan.
J. lie defendant has been given one
week to answer. 1'he effect of the
ruling by Judge Bryan is that the
case will be tried. Mr. Griffiths hoped
to win by demurring to the appeal.
Demurrer Overruled.
Judge Bryan has ruled on the de
murrer of Mr. Griffiths as follows:
ln the matter of the appeal of
Alfred Stone from certain orders made
by the Board of County Commission
ers of Canyon County. This case has
been submitted on defendant's de
murrer and motion to dismiss the ap
peal. The complaint on appeal alleges
that no necessity whatever existed for
the employment of the special coun
sel. It is true, as contended by de
fendant that appellant does not in so
many words allege that the commis
sioners were guilty of a violation of
their discretion, but I think the allega
tion that there was no necessity what
ever for the employement of special
counsel means the same thing. If the
allegation that there was no necessity
for the employment of special counsel
is sustained by proof then it must be
conceded it would be a violation of
their discretion on the part of the
commissioners to «employ special
counsel. 1 think the complaint is good
against the demurrer and motion filed
and that it is the duty of the court to
hear testimony as to whether such
necessity did exist. For the reasons
above stated the demurrer and mo
tion will be overruled and defendant
given one wjeek to answer.
Attorneys Employed.
Our present board of county com
missioners may have been economical
along some lines but they have cer
tainly provided the prosecuting attor
ney with ample legal assistance.
Among the lawyers who have been
employed are J. J. Plowhead, Curtis
Hayden, M. H. Eustace and H. E.
Wallace, at fees aggregating $925.00.
Mr. Frank Martin of Boise seems to
be a deputy prosecuting attorney as he
has been employed on the Moore case
at a fee of $250.00; on the Christopher
case at a fee of $600.00. This makes a
total of $1775.00 expended to help
Henry Griffiths.

Gold and Cost of Living.
A great deal of discussion has arisen
in financial circles concerning the ad
visability of the importation of such
vast quantities of gold to this country.
While it is true that foreign nations
must pay for the commodities we
send them, it is argued that the pres
ence of so much gold in this country
offers a dangerous tendency to infla
tion, and further accounts for the
rising of domestic commodities.
While recognizing that the increased
volume of gold permits the enlarged
issue of currency and is the base for
the great credit extended to Europe,
the question arises, is it a good thing
or a bad thing for the country to re
ceive gold in payment for debts owing
them? Suppose Europe, instead of
paying part in gioldl had kept her gold
and had paid us in additional Ameri
can securities, would that have been
a good or a bad thing for this country?
And is it probable, considering the
great demand for our products, that,
under such a condition, prices would
not have advanced? Granting that a
large volume of gold is to a certain
extent responsible for advanced val
ues in labor, products, etc., there are
many other factors which are quite as
much responsible. For instance, the
decreased supply of breadstuffs owing
to the partial failure of crops this
season surely must be considered as
being largely responsible for the ad
vance in grain and other food prod
ucts. The immense shipments of meat
to Europe and the decreased supply
of cattle, sheep and hogs surely must
be largely responsible for the high
prices for such products. The awful
waste produced by the war and the
terrible slaughter of men must also be
credited as a factor in high prices.
Likewise the scarcity of labor in this
country because of decreased immi
gration must be considered as contrib
uting its share to the high prices
which are being paid for the neces
saries of life. Combinations to raise
prices and the avidity with which
those who control or handle food sup
plies demand higher and higher
prices are one of the chief causes of
the great increase in the cost of living.
Some economists remind us that as
soon as the war has been concluded
the European nations will lose no time
in seeking back the gold which they
have shipped over here. This is per
fectly true, but we must also consider
that they will not receive this gold
as a gift, but must give us the equiv
alent either in commodities or in
securities.

beautiful assortment of Gifts. New

Air. Gipson accompanied Mrs. Gipson
and Mrs. Plowhead on their way to
Lewiston.
At Pendleton, a reception was ten
dered the delegates at Odd Fellows'
hall. The train reached Coeur d'Alene
on the morning of October 16th, on
schedule time.
The different branches of the order,
namely, the Grand Lodge, Grand En
campment. Rebekah Assembly and
Department Council, held sessions
during the week, all of which were
harmonious and satisfactory. Odd
Fellowship is strong and active in
Idaho, being the largest fraternal or
der in the state.
In the election of Grand Encamp
ment officers, A. E. Gipson was re
elected grand-treasurer, and Presley
F. Horn, grand scribe. T. E. Buckner
was chosen grand marshal of the
Grand Lodge and is one of the trus
tees of the Odd Fellows' Homie. L. S.
Dille is a member of the Grand Lodge
finance committee. Mr. Horn was
also chosen representative to the
Sovereign Lodge for the one year
term. A. E. Gipson served in that
capacity this year and is now an offi
cer in the Sovereign Lodge.
The decoration of Chivalry was
conferred during the week in one of
the city parks in the presence of
large number of people. The cere
mony was conducted by Col. Koch,
Department Commander of Washing
tan, and staff. The gentlemen receiv
ing this decoration were Presley F.
Horn and A. E. Gipson of Caldwell;
Maj. A. J. Moritz of Boise; Judge E.
L. Mitchell and O. M. Van Tassel of
St. Anthony. The ladies who were
decorated were Mesdames Delà Roper
and May Williams of Coeur d'Alene

Disson and Grace Flatt of Harrison;
Alice Dorkness of St. Mary's; Bertha
Balby of Rupert. Mrs. Ella Horn of

Build and to Manage," was given by
Superintendent Staley of the Wash

cated at Walla Walla. This address
was given before a joint session of all
branches of the order and keen in
terest was shown in it in view of the
fact that the Idaho home which is to
be built at Caldwell is attracting
good deal of attention. A strong
sentiment is crystalizing in favor of
founding such an institution here as
will be a model of its kind and a mat
ter of great pride to all members of
the order. The Idaho Home Fund
now amounts to about $74,000, and will
soon be sufficiently large so that the
Home Board will feel justified in be
ginning the erection of the buildings
A very impressive joint memorial

Double Wedding.
The Vanderwilt home on Deer Flat
was the scene of a wedding of double
proportions last Sunday afternoon, the
two daughters, Miss Nellie and Miss
"^lora, being the two chief actors in
the pretty drama, with Messrs. Thom
as G. Rose and Ralph W. Barnes, re
spectively, close seconds.
The house was decorated in blue
and white, with autumn leaves as a
background. The quartet stood be
neath a wedding bell of blue and white
ribbons while Rev. Wilson, presiding
elder of the Free Methodist church,
performed the double ceremony, which
formed the nucleus of two happy
homes. The brides were attired alike
in gowns of blue silk with lace gerni
ture and the grooms entered into the
color scheme in dark blue suits.
Following the ceremony and the
shower of congratulations, a dainty
two course lunch was served. The
young people were dined at the home
of Mr. and Mrs. L. F. Rose on Mon
day evening, where they were ten
dered a volunteer reception by several
neighborhoods, with a musical pro

variety thrown in.
Mr. and Mrs. Barnes will make their

Mrs. Rose will reside on Deer Flat.
Mrs. Davis Guest in City.
Mrs. D. W. Davis accopanied her
husband on his speech-making visit
to Caldwell last Saturday, and while
here was the guest of Mrs. Owen
Lovejoy at the Idaho hotel. The
Davises and the Lovejoys were close
friends in Iowa, having known one an
other since childhood, and Mrs. Love
joy is warm in her praise of Mrs.
Davis who is a woman of talent and
refinement and would grace any posi
tion in the gift of the state.
That Hallowe'en Dance.
Cats, jet black with fearfully arched
backs, grinning pumpins and spooky
suggestions of various kinds have
looked out of advertising cards in the
windows of business establishments
for the past two weeks, until the pub
lic has been duly warned of the Hal
lowe'en festivities scheduled for the
night of October 30th, under the For'
ward club's espionage.
A splendid game of football
promised for Saturday when the Cald
well high school meets Baker City at
Recreation Park. The public should
attend this game and encourage the
high school team. It is most worthy
of strong support.

CHRISTOPHER IS OUSTED
AS I ASSESSOR OF
In the matter of the ouster proceed
ings instituted by the county board
against A. O. Christopher. Judge
Lryan has entered an order removing
Mr. Christopher troin the otfice ot
assessor.
i ins action was instituted in June
and was based upon the charge that
Christopher had tailed to make report
ol his collections of personal property
taxes tor the months ot April, May
and June, 1916.
i here is no allegation in the ouster
^ ru " Um * ^ «-hnstopher is short
m Ins accounts and the decision oi
at
at
accounts and the decision of
judge liryan quoted below makes no
reference to any irregularity except
tlie mere failure to file the reports at
the time required by law.
Christopher testified at the hearing
that lus reason for not making detailed
reports for those months was that
all ol his time and that of his deputies
was required in making the assesment
and preparing the assessment roll,
which work had to be completed be
fore the first day of July; that it had
been his custom during previous years
to simply make a statement of the
gross amount of taxes collected dur
ing the rush season and after the an
nual assessment roll had been com
pleted to then prepare and file the
monthly reports in detail as required
by law.
ft is true, as stated by Judge Bryan,
in his decision that C. B. Ross testi
fied he had made frequent demands
upon Christopher to file these monthly
reports but Christopher flatly and em
phatically denied that either Ross or
any other person ever spoke to him
about filing these reports. Christo
pher testified that Ross on numerous
occasions requested him to rush the
collection of delinquent personal taxes
but that no member of the county
board ever made a demand for the de
tailed monthly reports.
Of course, the Democrats will claim
this decision in the ouster case as a
adjudication of the charges that Chris
topher is a defaulter, but a reading of
Judge Bryan's opinion will show that
the matter as to whether or not Chris
topher is short in his accounts is in
no wise involved.
Ben Ross and Griffiths are going
about the county bawling their heads
off about the Christopher shortage;
they are claiming that, if re-elected,
they will make the bonding company
come across with $30,000.00 which they
say Christopher owes the county. Of
course this is pure political bunk.
There is nothing to base their claim
upon except the Van Deusen audit
which everyone knows was a "bought
and paid for"; an audit which cost the
taxpayers $3500.00 and for which they
will never receive a dollar in return.
Van Deusen's report was made al
most a year ago; it showed that Chris
topher was largely in debt to the
county but the county board and the
county attorney have never had the
"guts" to institute a suit to recover
the amount claimed to be due from
either Christopher or the surety com
pany.
For purely -olitical and selfish pur
poses two criminal prosecutions have
been instituted against Christopher
and a complacent Democratic probate
judge, himself a candidate for re
election, has held Christopher to ans
wer in the district court.
If Christopher is a defaulter as
claimed by Van Deusen in his report,
why has the county attorney not
brought suit to recover on his official
bond? Why does Mr. Griffiths tiddle
around making charges of embezzle
ment instead of proceeding to recover
the alleged stolen money? He has had
a whole year in which to act and the
only move in the direction of action
to recover the money alleged to have
been misappropriated was that taken
the county commissioners when on
September 12th, 1916, an order was en
tered in the minutes to employ Frank
Martin, a Boise attorney, to assist the
county attorney in the suit against
Christopher and his bondsmen and to
pay Martin $600 for his services.
The county has already paid Van
Deusen $3500 for his audit, a retainer
fee of $250 to Frank Martin to assist
the county attorney in the suit against
G. H. Moore and $950.00 to certain
Caldwell attorneys for assisting Grif
fiths in the tax foreclosure cases.
The fact of the matter is that the
Van Deusen audit was essentially for
political purposes, it was "bought and
paid for' as such and the county board
and the county attorney know that
they dare not go to court with it to
sustain the alleged Christopher short
age. Mistakes without number in the
Van Deusen report have been discov
ered, the board and Griffiths know of
them and that is why, instead of
trying to recover the money claimed
to be due from Christopher in a civil
action, they have started criminal
prosecutions which they knew could
not be tried until after the November
election.
The people of Canyon county do
not believe that Christopher has ever
intentionally taken a single dollar of
the money belonging to Canyon coun
ty and they will continue to so be
lieve until by evidence it is shown
otherwise.
O. V. Badley, a Democratic county
clerk, was reported by Van Deusen to
be about $400.00 short in his accounts.
Why was Badley not prosecuted?
Why have his bondsmen not been
sued?
