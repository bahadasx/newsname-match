19 PERSONS PERISHED
IN HOSPITAL FIRE
Which Destroyed St. Elizabeth's Hos
pital, Farnham, Quebec.
Farnham, Quebec, Oct. 26. Nine
teen persons five children, eight
women and six men were believed
iate tonight to have lost their lives
ii. the fire which destroyed St. Eliza
beth's -hospital early today. There
were 218 persons in the hosnital of
whom 113 were children, 36 a'ged
women and the others servants and
assistants to the Grey Nuns.
The fire, the cause of which has
not been determined, still smouldered
at midnight, making it impossible to
ascertain accurately how 'many of the
inmates ofthe hospital had perished.
The property damage was estimated
at $135,000, partly covered by insur
ance. One reason for the difficulty in de
finitely establishing the loss of life,
it was said, was that the majoritv of
the inmates of the hospital were with
out relatives or friends. Those who
perished are helieved to have been en
tombed by tons of debris.
An investigation as to the cause of
the fire disclosed that a blaze started
in a chimney of the hospital Tuesday
night. It the - theory of the authori
ties that this smouldered and broke
out again last nighti
Many of the nuns, it was said, risk
ed their lives in efforts to save pa
tients and children entrapped in the
hospital. Fanned by a strong breeze,
the flames, unchecked by the small
jrts of wator the firemen were able to
throw on thr-m. rwont through the
building with lightning speed, cutting
off the inmates in thy various depart
ments. The .electrics went out soon after
the fire started and the nuns and oth
er rescuers had to work in the dark.
Men who went into the building said
thev had to carry out patients with
others hanging onto them. A number
of the rescuers were lost in the dark
ness and had narrow escapes.
One nun, single-handed, is said to
have saved lives of 45 children. She
stood on a balcony on the third floor
on which the children had been cut off
and handed them to the firemen on
ladders below.

MAYOR OF HAVERHILL
ON WITNESS STAND.

Charges of Failure to Prevent
Rioting,
Lawrence. Mass.. Oct. 26. A threat

Villa is Getting
Aid From the U. S.
SECRETRY BAKER HAS DEFINITE
INFORMATION
TO ATTACK AMERICANS
Generals Funston and Pershing Have
Been Informed and All American
, Forces Are in Readiness Plot
Fostered by Enemies of Administra
tion. Washington, Oct. 62. Secretary
Baker announced late today that the
war department had received definite
information that enemies of the gov
ernment's policy toward Mexico, in
connection with Villa or other bandits, 1
had arranged for a spectacular attack
on American troops on the border, to
be made before the election, to create
sentiment against the administration.
Full particulars of the plan, the sec
retary 6aid, had been forwarded to
Generals Funston and Pershing and
all the American forces are in readi
ness for the attack.
Mr. Baker issued this statement:
"The war department has received
definite information, confirmed from
other sources, that enemies Of the ad
ministration's policy toward Mexico,
in connection with Villa or other ban
dits in Mexico, have arranged a spec
tacular attack, to be made upon some
part of the American forces or upon
some American community on the
border, between now and the date of
the election, for the .purpose of turn
ing the tide of sentiment against the
policy whioh the administration has
adopted for the protection of the bor
der. "It is significant in this connection
that both the' state and war depart
ments were advised that the bandit
forces operating at the present time
in Mexico are being paid in eilver
coin.
"Full particulars have been trans
mitted to General Funston and Gen
eral Pershing. All American forces
are, therefore, forewardend and In
readiness for such an attack." '
Intimations of Attack.'
For some days vague intimations
that an attack of some sort along the
border might be in prospect have been
reaching the siate department. Up to
today they have been so indefinite, it
is understood, that officials were not
inclined to treat them seriously. There
were no clues on which to start an
investigation.
Villa Supplied With Money.
It has been know nfor some time,
also, that Villa, or whoever the bandit
chieftain may be who is operating
agajnst Carranza garrisons under that
name, . has had a considerable supply
botlr-of . silver' money and ammunition,
smuggled over the border from th
United States. The reference in Sec
retary Baker's statement to the fact
that Mexican bandits are known to
have been paid recently In silver is
thought to have been founded upon
those reports.
President Wilson Silent.
Cincinnati, Ohio, Oct. 2 3. Secre
tary Baker's statement was shown to
President Wilson here tonight, but he
would make no comment.
SUBMARINE WARFARE IS
DISCUSSED IN PARLIAMENT.
Recent Activity of the U-E3 Was Re
ferred To.
London, Oct. 26, 5.02 p, m. The ac
tivities of the German submarine U-53
near the American- coast and the gen
eral question of the relations of the
United States to submarine warfare
are matters to be considered between
the American and German govern
ments, said Foreign Secretary Grey in
the house of lords today. He depre
cated discussion of these questions
and said it was for the American gov
ernment to decide on the policy and
action required by the circumstances
of the case.
Baron Beresford stated that the ac
tion of American ships did not appear
to be quite within the bounds of neu
trality and that he thought the British
were bound to take notice of this fact.
The submarine question was brought
forward by Lord Sydenham, who asked
if the particulars of the sinking of the
British steamer Stephano and the oth
ers had been received, and whether
the circumstances were in accordance
with the German pledge to the United
States. He referred to "the activities
of the U-53 under the very eyes of the
American navy," and to the declara
tion of President Wilson which had re
sulted in the German pledge. Lord
Sydenham declared:
"Even before the exploits of the
U-53 that pledge was torn to shreds.
Yet the government of the United
States has made no suggestion what
ever that the sinking of neutral ships
goes on almost every day. The Nor
wegians have lost eighteen vessels in
this one month, and what must small
neutrals think of their powerful repre
sentative?" TO PENALIZE IMPORTS
OF BRITISH GOODS
In Accordance With Recently Passed
Legislation.
Washington, Oct. 26. Investigation
was started by the treasury depart
ment to determine what kinds of raw
materials imported from the British
empire should be subjetc to thrice the
regular customs duties in accordance
with the recently passed legislation
penalizing the importation of goods
under restrictions upon other dealings
of the importers.
Publication today of results of an
Investigation at the same department
showing that Great Britain has built
up a series of contracts to which im
porters of many of her raw materials
must submit created great surprise in
both treasury and other official circles,
not only because of the extent of the
allied domination of American trade
revealed, but because attention was
called to the applicability of paragraph
802 of the revenue bill, which appar
ently had escaped notice.
Treasury officials did not conceal
their concern over the unexpected in
formation and indicated that as far as
they knew the legislation would be
applicable immediately. Indeed, they
said -its provisions are mandatory and
not discretionary, as with the other
retaliatory acts.

MATTER TO BE TAKEN UP BY
THE BRITISH WAR COMMITTEE
TO COST $80,000,000
France Has Taken All Necessary Steps
to Enter Into Negotiations With
England for a Joint Construction of
the Tunnel Plans Have Been Out
lined.
London, Oct. 26, 6:09 p. m. Full re
consideration of the question of the
advisability of constructing a tunnel
under the Enelish Channel t
nect England and France was prom
ised today by Premier Asquith in re
ceiving a deputation in favor of the
project. He said the matter would be
taken up either by the war committee
or the committee on imperial defence.
Would Aid Troop Transportation.
The premier admitted that before
the war the balance of opinion had
been against the project, but said that
the experience of the war undoubted
ly was a new factor of immeasureable
importance in enabling statesmen and
naval and military experts to judge of
the value of a tunnel. "He added that
such a tunnel as the deputation pro
posed would have put the country in
a better position for transporting the
expeditionary force and for the general
purposes or tne war.
"1 will see,' ' added the premier,
"that tne time will be found for a full
review of the whole question in view
or tnat experience.
Late in August of this year it was
announced in Paris that France had
taken all the necessary steps to enter
into negotiations with Enjrland for the
joint construction of a tunnel under
the English Channel. Plans for the
tunnel were outlined at that time hv
M. Sartiaux, chief engineer of the
Nord Railway Company. He said the
tunnel would cost 16,000,000 pounds
and that if it was apportioned equally
Detween jiingiana and France two days'
war time expenditure of both coun
tries would more thn cover 'the cost
M. Sartiaux said that it was proposed
ot maKe two tunnels and that the dos
session of such a tunnel at the out
break of the war would have been of
great use to both France and England.
DRAMATIC STORY OF ABUSE
BY MRS. M. C. BEATINGER
On Trial for the Murder of Her Hus
band Her Five Children Present
five -young children seated only a few
feet from the jury bos, Mrs. Marga
ret Claire Beautinger. testified today
in ner own oerense in her trial tor
tne murder ot her husband, Cristof, a
-i-sew lurit coai mercnant,' tola a ara
matic story of abuse which she de
clared was responsible for the trascedv.
She began her narrative calmly but
became hysterical after telling of the
events which precipitated the shoot
ing in the Beutinger home at Caldwel,
N. J., early on the morning of July 11
last.
After Beutinger had gone to her
room twice the morning he was !Vled,
she said, she took from a bureau
drawer a revolver she admitted she
had purchased the day before. She
intended to frighten Beutinger with
the revolver, she added.
He returned to her room for the
third time and threatened, she de
clared, that he would kill her.
"I told him I was going to set an
other divorce," said Mrs. Beutiiger,
who already had testified .she was
married to Beutinger in 1906 and sub
sequently divorced him, but le-mar
ried him in 1915. "Then he rushed
toward me with his hand upraised and
a glazed look in his bulging eyes.
screamed ana con'tinmed to scream
while I reached under the pillow and
got tne revolver. Then I shot.
Little Marie and Margaret (two
of the Beutinger children) crept up to
me ana as they clung to me I moved
around the foot of the bed with the
revolver pointed in front of me. so
that I would not hit them. I pointed
it toward the window where my hus
band had stood. Then I sank on the
bed and little Marie got a wet towel
ana bathed my head. Then the ser
vants came.
Mrs. Beutinger said that when her
husband rushed toward her she
thought he was going to strangle her.
"When you fired the first shot, was
it accidental, or did you fire at your
husband, thinking your life was in
danger?" asked counsel.
"I think it was both," she replied.
"Of course, my life was in danger."
Mrs. Beutinger told of interceding
on one occasion with the secretary of
war for her husband, who had been a
clerk in the army quartermaster's de
partment in the Philippines but was
dismissed. Askey why she had ap
pealed to the secretary of war, she
said a charge of graft had been made
against Beutinger.
RELATION OF UNITED STATES
TO THE EUROPEAN WAR
Treated of by President Wilson in His
Address at Cincinnati.
Cincinnati, O., Oct. 26. Taking ad
vantage of a strenuous . isit to Cin
cinnati to discuss the relation of the
United States to the European war,
President Wilson today declared that
"this is the last war that involves the
world that the United States can keep
out of." He gave as his reason his
belief that "the business of neutrality
is over" and that "war now has such
a scale that the position of neutrals
sooner or later becomes intolerable."
He added that the nations of the
world must get together and say " MNo
body can hereafter be neutral as re
spects the disturbance of the world's
peace for an object which the world's
opinion cannot sanction."
After denying the republican claim
that the business prosperity c of the
United States during the last two years
has been due to trade created by the
war, the president ridiculed predic
tions that after the war Europe will
overwhelm this nation by Its economic
strength and "dump" in the United
States goods now being stored up for
a purpose. Bfe. asserted tha texports

be left unprotected by the country
from which he came." '

the assertion made by Dr. Thomas T.
Harrington, deputy commissioner i

tion. "
"Infantile paralysis Is due to chem-j
ical agents, namely, gases and fumes .
given off in the atmasphere by the
combustion of oils and fluids used In ;
automobiles." Dr. Harrington declared.
"Cases of gas and fume poisoning and;
cases of infantile paralysis agree In ;
every essential.
"In infantile paralysis we are deal-?,
ing with a chemical agent and not a ;
micro-organism. Infants and old per
sons are more susceptible to the mala- j
dy. Although Infantile paralysis has.
been epidemic for years, its prevalence ,
in epidemic form dates from the Intro-,
duction and wide use of the automo
bile." CHIEF OF DIVISION
