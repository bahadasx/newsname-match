s "I defy aD>" iniin ti> go into the state

member of the state senate and show
any vote of mine against the interests
of labor, organized or unorganized. J
defy them to brine a solitary bill
where I voted against them," was the
ringing challenge of John J. Cornwell.
Democratic nominee for Govrenor,
in bis speech here Wednesday
... night, replying to a public statement
Issued by Charles Hugglns, President
of the West Virginia Federation of
Labor, and many other labor leaders
of the state denouncing CoruwuII and
appealing to all laboring men to votej
for Judge Ira E. X.'oblnson, "a friend 1
of iabor tried and true."
The laboring men accepted Mr.
Cornwall's challenge, and they gava!
out another stntemcnt giving Corn-,
well's record as a member of tlioj
state senate during the legislative j
sessions of 1903 and 1905. which I
i show that Cornwell either voted
r openly against practically every labor j
measure coming up at both of those
sessions or was recorded as "present!
w but. not voting."
* The record of the senate shows
that Cornwell as a member of the
senate judiciary committee, concur-!
red in unfavorable reports on the fellow
servnnts bill, the bill lo prevent
employment oi children under fourteen
years of age In factories and
i mills, the bill providing Tor a com* '

'' tect thel lives qf railroad employes'

The record discloses further that

"There are many issuer of the present

stated Senator William E. Chilton
last night in his speech at the

talked about the issues and conclusively
and easily proved his statement.
Local political audiences do not care

In which the audience behaved last

While the Senator was in tho midst of
his most fanciful pathetic pictures of
the poor native West Virginian many
of the men in the b?ci of the room
got up and left. This was rude and
thoughtless but they left nevertheless.
Whether they had tlrod of the monotonous
maudlin and sanctimonious
manner of tho Senator's delivery or
whether they did not like as "Tho
present prosperity of tbe country is
due to the Underwood Bill" or the
sweeping assertion that "Republican
orators are mosahaeks" '1. not known.
Yet with all of that the Senator had

the crowd was not an enthusiastic

applause before he had finished bis

The Senator pulled out the tremulo
stops and described his party with all
the fervor of a country minister making

Washington. Jelterson, Jackson and
Lincoln and then with a sob In his
voice asked the assemblage to "Thank

Change Came When Republicans
Took Charge of
Government.
MR. ROBlii'S SPEECH
Arraigns Cornwell For His
Refusal to Stand on His
Platform.
Hundred* of persons were turned
nway this afternoon and were unable
to hear Judge Ira Robinson because
of the refusal of Mayor Howen to allow
the local committee to hold an
open air meeting from the court house
steps. However the largest crowd that
has ever been Inside the court house
packed the circuit court room and
filled the corridors outside the doors
in the effort to hear the Judge even it
they were unable to see hint.
The meeting was called to order
promptly at 2:30 o'clock by County
Chairman Frank R. Amos and J. A.
Meredith with a few brief remarkB
introduced Judge Robinsou.
At the outset of ills speeclt tho
judge declared that lie stood squarely
upon the platform of the Republican
party, made at the convention in
Huntington, on August 10. last, and
that he had no apologies to make for
that stand. He said it had been a
notable fact throughout the campaign
that his opponent. John J. Cornwell,
had refused 10 stand on the platform
ol his own party?a document of criticism
and ubusc which characterizes
Republicans generally and individually
as a set of pick pockets and
thieves.
"My opponeut seeks to appeal to
petty passions and prejudices among
Republicans," said the judge. "He
says there Is soreness in the Republican
party. We have not found it so.
He admits that he must have thousands
of Republican votes to win, and
appeals to those his, platform calls
pick pockets and thieves to vote for
him. 1 call that a very small line of
statesmanship. Mr. Cornwell may not
stand on his platform now. but be
would be I'm red to stand on it in case
of his election. I do not ask for your
votC3 unless you believe in the constructive
advance of our state as exempli
fled in the bencflclal policies of
the Republican party. Measures, not
men, are the issues. The party Is the
candidate. 1 am sure the good people
of West Virginia arc not going to
cast aside principle in this election.
1 have now visited every section of
our state and have found the Republican
party united and determined as
never before 011 victory this year. We
need only to be vigilant to win a
greater victory than ever before.
"In 1896 when the Republicans
came into power in West Virginia
through the election of Governor
George Wesley Atkinson, we were
noted abroad only as snake hunters,
seng diggeis and Democrats. We
were ashamed when we left the state
to acknowledge that we were West
Virginians. Under the constructive
policies and efficient direction of the
Republican party since 1896, our
state has bloomed and blossomed as
the rose and we have come to be nationally
nown as the most rapidly developed
state in the union. Now
when we go abroad we are proud to
acknowledge that we hall from West
Virginia, and the world is glad to
meet us and to compliment us on our
wondorfui progress.
"I stand for greater state reputaUnn
onr! rrron toe clntn nffintnnno nnd
above all economy In the administration
of state affairs. But. I stand for
progress with economy. I shall never
stand for a single backward stop In
the work wo are doing In West Virginia
for human good. The Republican
party believes not In retrogression,
but advance.
"We must continue to maintain
and improve our Institutions for the
care of the deaf, dumb, blind, insane
and other unfortunates. Our normal
schools, colleges and university must
keep step with the times. Agricultural
extension work so well started
must be continued, and the time has
now come, owing to the close Interrelation
of states and counties for a
policy of federal and Btate aid In the
construction and maintenance of good
roads.
"One of the problems of the day
that I propose to work out,tor the
people of West Virginia as their governor
Is that of moro efficient and
more economical construction and
maintenance of our highways.' In
thlB day when the advance of automobiles
has brought a greater Interrelation
between counties and states
the call to us Is to prepare good
roads. By work of this character wo
will render a service not only to humanity
of the present bat to that of
the future.
"The commerlclal aspect of it, the
aiding of the great course of life and
industry in the state is of high importance,
but not all that comes from
good roads. Our natural scenerv. our
blue gross lands and our mineral resources
are unexcelled. The opening
up to a ready view of all these Is of
wonderful Importance for an Increase
of the population and the Industry of
our state that makes for better life
an<l greater development. Tourists
passing through will not forget West
Virginia.

Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt. president
of the National and International
Woman Suffrage association who will
speak here next Tuesday afternoon Is
one of the most noted women in the
world today. In every country and In;
ovory clime her voice has been raised i
for the enfranchisement of women.
I She has been honored by being invited
to address many state legislatures,
and National conventions of all
the great parties. Mrs. Catt is looked
upon by the men and women all over
the world as the final authority on
the subject of equal suffrage.
There is another, and a local rcas-|
on for great interest in the coming
here of Mrs. Catt at this time. Sho
and her national organization and its
officials have been made objects of
what they consider the most subtle
and lebelous attack in the press of .
the state by a citizen of Fairmont who '
is the paid press agent of the Anti organization.
It is expected that in her '
address next Tuesday afternoon Mrs.
Catt will have some remarkB to make :
regarding such campaign tactics. :
The officials at State Suffrage headquarters
at Morgantown. as well as at
National headquarters in New York,
are Indignant at those attacks on or- :
dalned ministers of the gospel and up- :
on women of the highest moral integ- .
rity. They characterize them as elan
derous and wilfully untrue.
As next Tuesday Is the only date :
which Mrs. Catt can give to Fairmont
and as Tuesday night Is all Hallowe'en !
it was not possible to hold a night
meeting. The hour of four o'clock in .
the afternoon has been selected as
the most desirable time for the meeting.
