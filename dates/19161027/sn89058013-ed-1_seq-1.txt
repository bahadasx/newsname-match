ENDORSEMENT
, OF MR EHODES
Gravette, Ark., October 14, 1916.
E. H. Dowdy,
Huntingdon, Tenn.
Dear Brother Dowdy For many
days I have known Brother Rhodes
was exceedingly modeat, inclined
to avoid ..rather than pinnge into
the lime-light but it seems to me
that in this instance he should at
least be willing to let his friends
in Arkansas and the nation know
that the good people of his district
deBire him to represent them in
Congress. The news of his nom
ination came to me indirectly but
my interest has been so fired by it
that I can not refrain from ex
pressing to you, his very close
friend, the interest our brethern in
Arkansas have in his candidacy.
This State is, as you are well
aware, one that belongs to the sol
id South. The office seeker, here
who secures the nomination of the
dominant party is virtually elected.
All that then remains is the shout
ing. This has been true for years
past and wiil be true for years to
come, but let me venture the asser
tion that scarcely a farmer could
be found in this hide-bound State,
if we may term it such, who would
wot vote for Rhc-des if the oppor
tunity afforded. Why would they
do this? Those who know Rhodes
need no explanation. To know the
rnan is reason enough for making
this statement.
The Farmers' Union is the great
est force of the age in cementing
the straggling individual American
farmers into a solid phalanx of
strength and power. Legislation
is, in the process of evolution,
drifting more and more away from
thy demagogue who hold party
above principle and is shaping it
uvlf along business lines, where
manhood, intellectual ability and
true worth count for more than
Bordid party issues. No class has
Imd more influence in this forward
movement than the American
former, and no agency has been of
greater assistance to him in this
hmdable effort than the Farmers'
ID .1 ion. The organization 1ms al
ways tabooed partisan politics but
hns been untiring in its efforts to
have its members study political
economy, especially in the relation
ol the Biibject to agriculture.
Chief among the leaders of the or
ganization who hve worked un
ceasingly 'in the interests of the
people i standing upon the broad
principle just mentioned, is Rhodes
ol 'Ir'enneaseu.
T!
School Auditorium
I have worked with him for ua
tional legislation when the Repub
licans were in power and when the
Democrats were in power, and a
broader-gauged man has never
been uncovered in the ranks of
this organization, lie seemed to
be possessed with one ambition,
that to serve the people whosein
terests he represented.
I am profoundly interested in
this Congressional contest in your
district. Not because of any great
issues involved between the par
ties, for every one knows the issues
are much bigger in the minds of
the spell binders than anywhere
else. Not because of any person
alities, for I take it that the people
of your district would not put for
ward any man whose character was
not above reproach and who was
not a gentlemen in every sense of
the word.. But because it repre
sents a contest waged by the Amer
ican farmer to have his position in
the commercial life of this nation
recognized in the halls of the Na
tion Congress by seating one of
the noblest of his class among the
high and mighty. This contest
wilK be watched throughout the
country. Will the farmers of your
district make good?
Brother Dowdy, I shall expect
you to keep me advised as to the
progress of the campaign, Rhodes
is perhaps too busy to bother with
an Arkansan, and I shall not annoy
him by writing.
With kindest personal regards,
I am, fraternally yours,
A. G. Davis,
National Secretary-Treasurer of
the Farmers' Union.
Cbokeville, Tenn., October 9, 1916.
Hon. E.'H. Dowdy,
Huntingdon, Tenn.
Dear. Mr. Dowdy If I lived in
the Eighth Congressional District
of Tennessee I would vote to send
L. M. Rhodes to Congress as sure
as I was able to get to the polls on
November 7, and I have a mighty
good reason why I should do so.
Mr. Rhodes is a farmer and has
lived among farmers all his life.
He knows all about their trials aud
tribulations, their tips and downs,
joys and sorrows, struggles, hopes
and fears. He sprang from sturdy
pioneer stock. He is bone of their
bone, and flesh of their flesh. In
stilled in every fibre of his being
is their grit and pluck and loyal
love for , honor, home and uative
land. He, himself, is a type of
pioneer, for he has fought for many
a long year to lead the farmers out
of the wilderness of special privi
lege monopoly and gveed into the
land of industrial equity aud jus
tice.
No man in America has told
more truth to more farmers, in
more places, at more times and
with more . power than L. M.
Rhodes.,
I know Mr. Rhodes personally,
and have had opportunity ,to study
him at close range. He is full of
vigor and vim that comes of living
the clean life. Powerful in physical
strength, he has moral strength of
like kind. Few men could throw
him in aphysical wrestle; theire are
none who could break down his in
nate strength of character. He is
a type of well-balanced manhood,
with strength of body and vigor of
mind, both governed by a heart
that always beats strong and true
for humanity. Before a crowd he
is a power, I heard him speak to
literal acres of people and hold
their wrapt attention for nearly
two hours. His brain is a veritable
encyclopedia of facts and figures.
I have never seen a man with such
memory for statistics and such
ability to marshal them in a logi
cal, convincing manner.
I consider L. M. Rhodes the
peer of any man in public life to
day. He would take rank upon
the floor of the House as an able
friend of Ihe great common people
of the-nation. If the voters of the
Eighth District of Tennessee are
awake to their duty they will for
get party ties and on November 7
elect to Congress L. M. Rhodes,
a man whom God made bigger
than a mere partisan and better
than a politician.
Yours sincerely, -
B C. HUDDLESTON,
Democrat, Putnam County. Adv.
