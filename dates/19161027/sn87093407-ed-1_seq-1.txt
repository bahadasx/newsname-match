HtfTISH KM NATAL BATTLE
FOR A NEW FREEDOM
The nonpartisan bill filed yesterday as an initiative bill by Councilman
Erickson calls for a new political freedom in this state.
It is the freedom from the shackles of party slavery.
It is the freedom which gives full and unlimited opportunity to judge
men on their merits when they seek political office instead of allowing
many of them to slip into office on the strength of the party label.
Ward heelers, political tools of every kind, big and small, are against
putting the county and state on the same nonpartisan basis as the city of
Seattle and moat every city in this state are now enjoying.
We elect our councilmen, our mayor, and other officials without asking
whether they are republicans, democrats or socialists.
There is no more reason why a county coroner, state auditor, governor,
or member of the legislature, should be elected as a republican or democrat
than that he should be elected because he is a Baptist or an Episcopalian.
THERE IS NO QUESTION AFFECTING COUNTY ADMINISTRA
TION OR STATE ADMINISTRATION THAT SHOULD BE DECIDED ON
PARTISANSHIP.
Opponents of nonpartisanship ire hereby challenged to name one.
The nonpartisanship bill has been filed. It is now awaiting action from
Secretary of State Howell and Attorney General Tanner. It is up to them to
act without delay. Will they do it? Or will they attempt to delay it so long
that the petitions will not be distributed by election day. The state has its
eye on them.
In the meantime, let each independent voter, man or woman, get ready
tfor a whirlwind ca.npaifn to secure 100,000 signature* or mote to the bill
/for a newer freedom—to secure so many signatures that even a reactionary
legislature will recognise the demand for it '
