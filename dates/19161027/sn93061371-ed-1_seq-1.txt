HOW RESERVE
SYSTEM HELPS
Provides Money to Move
Cotton Crop at Six
Per Cent.
In a cM.'.p'ateh to the New
York "World" from Dallas,
Tex., Sej t. 24, p-actically illus
tration of how the Fedeial Re
serv'3 Sy6tem has become of
vast practical utility is given
It is stated that the total yield
Of foUon in Texas will be about
4,000,COO bales, which will net
about $400,CoO,000 the farmers.
"The Federal Reserve Bank
of Dallas is putting out money
for handling the Texas crop at
ths rate of approximately $500,
000 per day," says the dispatch
"In view of the fact that com
paratively little cotton is being
held, the large demand for funds
with which to move tho Crop is
somewhat surprising. The sig
nificant thing about, the matter,
lidwete'f'i is thaft instead of pay
ing 8 and i0 peT Cent, for the
money, the farmers and cotton
buyers are now ible to obtain it
for fi per cent. It was expect
ed that in event of low or un
satisfactory prices there would
life a large amount of money
advanced as loans through the
Federal Reserve Bank on - ware
house receipts, but up to this
time requests for loans of this
character have been very few."
TAX RECORD OF
H. 0. BURSUM,
TAX REFORMER
Geo C. Deen of Poi tales last
week bought eighty head of
two-year-old. heifers from D. B
Clayton, for which he paid ?S0
per liead all round. Tho cattle
are higli giade and said td bb
one of the finest bunches in the
Portales Valley.
Their Wires Crossed.
With Republicans on the
stump attempting to have it
appear that American piospen
ty is due to sales of war muni
lions, the disclosures of Senator
Penrose in the Senate are inter
esting. The war revenue bill
waft nendimr August 24 last and
Senator Penrose took the floor
to onnose the tax on the profits
of the war munitions business,
which has since become law.
"T think it is nd exoneration
to sav." Penrose declared, ''that
a large majority of the manu
facturers who went into the
munitions business have not
fared well: many have gone in
to bankruptcy; many more have
made no money at all; some
have made a fair profit, and, of
- t
cruise, a very tew have mace
good profits."

Socorro Cunty Records Show That
In Ten Years H Had Paid Only
$38.26 Out or Over $j.00O Assessed
Against Him.
H. O. Biirsiitn, Ucpiilnican candi
date for governor, who put lhrov,;u
the last Legislature the so-called Bur
;Um tax bill, which was drawn by
Charles r.'iriiiKer ami W. A. Hawklna,
representatives of powerful corpora
tions, declares himself the Friend of
the People and the Champion of the
Taxpayers. Notwithstanding his part
in the passage of the Uursuin bill, h
ia now making excuses for it and
promising taxation reform.
Reform should always begin at
home.
Mr. Hursum's own record as a lax
payer will he of interest to the tax
payers to whom he has been promis
ing taxation reform.
An examination of tbn records la
Kocorro county, where Tax Reformer
Ltui'bUm Is supikosed to pay his taxes,
showed on September 7, 191C, that.'
Taxes amounting to $5,172.77 had.
been assessed against Mr. Uursuni per
sonally since 19(!6, anil almost the ett
(lf amount remains unpaid.
Of all !ap assessed against Mr.
Bursuni personally 3itic taoc he had
paid only $8S.2C.
He had personally paid only 188.2
In taxes since 1 9(;C.
No sales of Bursum tax certificate
had been made except by Max Mon
toya, Democratic county treasurer,
since he took office in 1912. A Demo
cratic distrit attorney found that th
sale of Bursuni property for taxes
would be difficult, owing to the vague
ness with which It is described on the
rolls.
It Is Interesting to note In this con
nection that the Bursuni bill has no
provision relating to the collection of
taxes.
Reform begins at home and re
formers must come before the people
wl'h clean hands.
iWliat do the voters of New Mexico
think of a Taxation Reformer who
paid practically none of his personal
taXfis for ten years?
Do the voters of New Mexico want
a man for governor who doesn't pay
'la Uirs in NVw ?Ie,;lco?
