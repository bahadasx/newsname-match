"Hon. Harold Knutson, Republican Can
didate far Congress, St. Cloud:
"I hereby challenge you to meet me in
three or more, if you desire, joint de
bates, to debate the issues of this cam
paign one of said meetings to be held
•at St. Cloud the others in cities in this
congressional district as you may select,
each of us to pay one-half the expenses

challenge I will cancel all my other
dates, which may conflict with said meet
ings. You will kindly answer at once.
W. F. Donohue,
"Democratic Candidate for Congress,
"Melrose, Minn."
"I am willing to leave the verdict of
this campaign entirely to the people and
3 believe this is the most effective means
«t bringing this about," Mr. Donohue
paid.

judge for themselves which set of
principles shall prevail."
Mr. Knutson has declined, stating that

FOR ELECTRIC LIGHTING IK.LLF
•). TLE FALLS-SOME FACTS
WORTH NOTING
The Transcript.of Monday published r.
list of electric light consumers, etated to
be those in the business and W»fence
lighting classes who are included among
those now paying above the minimum
and those, who would pay above, the
minimum under the proposed schedule-of
rates. The patrons are noted by num
bef and not by name and thqnumborof
drops used by each patixm' is ncw stated.
Xt{ ist-presumed* that the list was fur
nished the Transcript by the local elec
tric company. The article" also states
that the residence lighting under the
proposed "rate would show a decrease of
15 per cent and the commercial-lighting
a decrease of 9% per cent, these rates
figured from the tcval received by the
company in the two. classes of light pa
trons. using above minimum of $L Fig
ures are taken ifrom September as being
an average month, and we are tajting
the Transcript figures as a basis.
The article s^ys that in the residence
lighting the number who "will use above
the minimum is 369. Of these they isay
there are 267 who are. lowered under the
proposed rate, 97 raised and five wfli re
main the same. However there are 612
residence users on the meter rates, and
taking tneir figures, it is evident that the
Ujiinimum rate users' number SC. There
are also 30 light users on-a two-light^flat
rate, and 30 two-light flat rate -usens also^
paying 50 cents for a flat iron. Is there
any reason why the whole su^a received
by the company, should not be the basis
on which to figure percentage of Increase
or decrease to the company on the aggre
gate amount of money to. be received
under the old system and the proposed
rate?
Our figures are like this:
Residence Lighting—Present Rate
369 patrons paying .*82.80
243 patrons (minimum lignt usejs) £Q.OO
30 patrons (2-light flat, 60c) ...18.00
30 patrons (2-light flat, 60c and SOc
for flat iron) 38.0®.
Present aggregate revenue .'$*76.80
Proposed Rate
369 patrons paying ......1587.13
243 patrons (minimum light users) 243.00
30 patrons (2-light flat, 60c) 18.00
30 patrons (2-light flat, 60c, and 50c
for flat iron) 33.60
Aggregate revenue under pro
posed rate .........
1861.13
The difference between the two tables
is in amount the same as the Transcript
figures, but it will be found thait instead
of a 15 per cent decrease on the aggre
gate of light consumed by all Residence
light patrons it is 9.8 per cent.
Furthermore by the writer's own fig
ures practically all the increases will
come from patrons using under six
lights. On this basis these ^rith the
minimum users outnumber those receiv
ing decreases by 78. This without taking
into consideration the flat rate custom
ers, which it has been stated will remain
the same.
In the commercial lighting class the.
Transcript gives as matrons using above
the minimum 122. Of these 69 are low
ered, 52 are raised and one remains the
same. In all there are 148 users on the
met®f baSis, therefore cm
bajisi According to this those raised
and those ren.aining dri the minimum
basis number 78, as against 6# that are
lowered. It might also be mentioned
that while there is a decrease of $68.53
to the company from all the commercial
patrons under the new rate, that but five
of the decreases aggregate $49.34. Bight
more of the patrons receiving a decrease
added to the five will more than wipe
out the $68.53. She Kid the 7§ pay for
these decreases, and the others or have
these patrons heretofore paid a too-high
rate?
Our figures are like this:
Commercial—Present Rate
122 patrons paying .$716.13
26 patrons (minimum light users).. 26.00
Present aggregate revenue .......|8R.13
Proposed Rate
122 patrons paying $707.60
26 patrons (minimum light users).. 25.00
Aggregate revenue under pro
posed rate H8S.60
The difference in decrease between
these two tables and the Transcript fig
ures is also the same, but instead of a
decrease of 9% per cent, we get 8% per
cent.
As noted above only five consumers.
No. 116 with a decrease of $15.72 No. C29
with a decrease of $11.52 NO. ®0 with a
decrease of $8.42 No. 693 with a decrees*
of $4.86 and No. 956b with a decrease of
$8.82, amounting to $49.34, dispose of over
two-thirds of the total decrease of $88.53
in commercial lighting.
Under the old rate the live above men
tioned paid $152.36, and under the «ew
rate would pay $103.02. Below la a table
showing amount and /ate of percentage
of decrease with the five toft out "Of
both.''
Total of $802.13 less $152.36 $649.77
Total of $733.60 iess $103.02—....... MD.58
Difference eliminating the 5....... S&-19
With the elimination of the five sharp
decreases from the table, it will be seen
that the rate of decrease on the aggre
gate would be less than three per cent,
and with eight more of those receiving a
decrease under the proposed rate it
would more than wipe out the total de
crease.
After going over the above figures- doea
it seem to you Mr. Light User and Mr.
Citizen who might want to use ttgfcts,
that the proposed rate is a substantial
reduction to light pttrons generally or
that it is an equitable adjustment?
The Herald editor, who is also the
signer of the minority report, still thinks
not.
