Atlantic City. N. J., October 26
Reports that Villa wna driving troops
Mexican de facto government troops
in Chihuahua were denied In a state
ment issued today by the Mexlcan
Ajierlcan Joint commission In session
here. Explanation also was made of
the absence from Mexico at thla time

"lelegrams from (iencral Trevino
state that he has 8.000 troops In and
around Chihuahua w ith which to meet
a Vlllista forte of something more
than 1,000," said the statement. "Gen
eral Trevino's family has left Chihua
hua and fMM to Jailers because of the
plan of General Trevino to take the
field. First C hief C'arronza is in the
City of Mexico with all hla cabinet and
all will probably move to Querctaro
within a short time. Queretaro is the
capltol of Mexico by decree made eight
months ago. The constitutional con
vention will be held In Queretaro on
November 0.
"Mrs. Obregon, who was married
about a year ago, is on her way to
mother's in Lob Angeles. Mrs. Cnr
ranza, who went to San Antonio to
make purchases, will return to Mexi
co City in a few days with Colonel
Juan Barragan, General Carranza's
chief of staff, who was recently In
New York and is now on his way to
San Antonio.
"The story published of Carranza's
being in Queretaro as the possibl?
prisoner of General Obergon Is known
to be untrue. So is the story of Gen.
Ozuni.'s death.
"Felix Diaz, who has been reported
to be in OnxAca is known to be in
Chiapas, on the border of Guatemala,
which is said to be his base of sup
plies." The chief subject discussed today
was a demand by General Carranza's
commissioners that Mexicans under In
dictments in their own country be re
turned to Mexico for trial.

LOVELY NEW CREPE BLOUSES
Embroidery decorates many waists. Sometimes it is on the collar; sometimes
down the front; sometimes on the frill. Usually it is in white; but sometimes the
delicate shell pink is used. Often a bit of lace is added filet, Venise, Valenciennes
just enough to be charmingly effective. All these new waists are in white or
flesh color. Prices $3.98, $5, $5.90.
SUITS THAT ALWAYS FIND FAVOR
Plenty of the navy gaberdines and serges all women like. They cleverly du
plicate the smart effects of much higher priced suits. Values of assured merit at
$15 to $50.
