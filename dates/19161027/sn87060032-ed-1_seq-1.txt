"What Wpvild he give
for the coffee you serve?
Like a million other wom
en, you can serve coffee .hat
he would Rive most anything
to have coffee which -starts
the day "right" for all.
Everyone loves the rich
flavor of Arbuckles' Coffee.
Of all the coffees in America
today, it is by far the most
popular!
Today there are whole towns where Arbuckles
is practically the only coffee used. In one State,
alone, in a year, four pounds of Arbuckles Coffee
was used for every man, woman and child in the
State four times as many pounds of coffee as the
population of the State I ArbuckleBros.,Ne w York.

'pntrio ism tnd has dulled the
1 moral sense of nur people. More
over, in addition to the fact that
his deeiU have made his lnft
utterances matters of contemp
tious derisions. Some of his
word themselves have eaten into
the souls of our people with the
acid of I'gredation. A little
whil ago in one of our large
cities a school teacher declined
to allow the children in h clas
to t'uvi pitri )'... 1 it is
snii.ll wonder th.it . i . : Id be
h" l"im when the . i. I eviutivo
set. the 1. .nd ef even-i that
Prt-idei t Wi!M)n has .-let. If the
Pro-ident is inspi:ed bv the sink
ing of The Lusitnnia with ll.e
loss of 1,311(1 ifvt..s only to make
his remark about being "Too
proud to fight," it is not to lie
wondered at some of his t'rieiuK
should feel reluctance to sing thf
"Star Sjnngled Banner."
If the President nevei ventures
to raise his voice in protesting
against the treacherous murder
of Boyd and Adair, and their
Troopers, those who follow hint
are to be excused for refusing to
sing America.
The selection of Mr. Hughes is
the only way by which we can
now restore the tone of the
national conscience and give to
our people once more the feeling
of the beauty of patriotism. Mr.
Wilson has taught us that adroit
and graceful elocution may be
one of the worst gifts which an
evil fate can dower the Chief
Executive of the Nation.
Against the man of mere elocu
tion we have put in Mr. Hughes,
the man whose intellectual
straight-forwardness, wh se rug
ged strength of charade, and
whose courageous sinceretj of
purpose give us a guarantee that
every promise he makes either
expressed or implied will be
made good by his actions.
Dr. Tye Has
Narrow Escape.
Dr. John G. Tye had nnat row
escape from death last Sunday
morning between six and seven
o'clock when his automobile
turned over with him and pinned
him to the ground. The machine
left the road and landed about
seventy feet down an embank
ment, holding him fast until help
could come to him. He got a
mule and rode into town and in
formed Walter T. Cody of the
whereabouts of his Ford. Cody
after hearing'how badly the Foro
was battered up took the neces
sary repairs, and in three houiv
he had "Miss Ford" back in
town and te Doctor was ready
for another episode.
