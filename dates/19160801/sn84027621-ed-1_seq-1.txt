BIG FORCE GATHERED
AROUND BROWNSVILLE
Army the Largest in America Since
. the Civil War Ended
Brownsville, Texas, July 31. From
Point Isabel on the Gulf of Mexico to
Fort Ringgold at, Rio Grande City,
which marks the western terminus of
the Brownsville district, stretches in
an -almost unbroken line of khaki a
"thin drab line of 'eroes," as Kipling
might have said. It is the largest
single army brought together under
the American flag since the civil war
by far the largest of the many con
centration districts on the Mexican
border in the lower Rio Grand valley,
where almost 50,000 soldiers are sta
tioned. They are made up about as
follows :;
Regulars, 5300; New York troops,
14,000; Texas, 2800; Illinois, 1300;
Virginia, 2400; Minnesota, 4000; In

Dakota, 1200; North-Dakota, 1000;
Louisiana, 2500; . Oklahoma, 2200;
Iowa 2500; a total of nearly 50,000.
When the newly organized Thirty
sixth Infantry and . Seventeenth Cav
alry get under canvas at Brownsville
that number will be exceeded.
' There will be then In the district an
army in the full military sense of the
word, or approximately one and two

division, comprising the regulars,

(Associated
New York, , Aug. l.r Charles E.
Hughes last night outlined in 1m
speech of acceptance of the republi
can nomination the issues upon which
he will conduct his campaign, for the
presidency. He assailed the adminis
tration for the course ifr has pursued
with reference to Mexico, prepared
ness and other great questions of the
day. He declared for a policy of
"firmness and consistency" toward
Mexico, for the "unflinching mainte
nance of all American rights on land
and sea," and for "adequate national
defense; adequate protection on both
our western and eastern coasts."
"We denounce all plots and con
spiracies in the interest of any for
eign nation," Mr. Hughes said. "Ut
terly intolerable is the use of our soil
for alien intrigues. Every American
must unreservedly condemn them and
support every effort jfor their sup
presion." "I endorse the declaration in the
platform in favor of woman suffrage,"
Mr. Hughes declared. And he added:
Opposition may delay, but in my
judgment cannot defeat this move
ment I favor the vote for wom
en."' , "' V , : :v: . :
One-fourth of the speech was devot
ed to Mexico. Step after step taken
by the administration with reference
to Mexico was assailed from the days
of Huerta to the note sent the de
facto government by. the state depart
ment June 20, last.'
"The seizure of Vera Cruz," the
nominee said, "was war, of course.
Later we retired from Vera Cruz," he
continued, "giving up this noble war
fare. We are now informed that we
did not go to Vera Cruz to force
Huerta to salute the flag. We are
told that he went there to show Mex
ico that we were in earnest in our de
mand that Huerta must go."
America, Mr. Hughes continued,
had no policy of aggression toward
Mexico, no desire for any part of her
territory? but wishes her to have
peace, stability and prosperity.
"Th conductf the administration
has created difficulties we shall have
to surmount," he said. "We demand
from Mexico, the protection of the
lives and property of our citizens, and
the security of qut border from depre
dations." The safeguarding American rights
abroad had not been accomplished,
Mr. Hughes said, by the administra
tion. There had been "brave words
in a series of notes," but "what does
it avail to use some of the strongest
words known to diplomacy if ambas
sadors can receive the impression
that the words are not to be taken
seriously?"
The nominee reiterated his declara
tion that had this government left no
doubt that it meant to hold Germany
to "strict accountability" there would
have been no loss of -life on the Lusi
tania. - . '' -p - -
Discussing preparedness, Mr.
Hughes said it was apparent that the
United States was "shockingly unpre
pared." "The administration has failed to
discharge its responsibilities," Mr.
Hughes declared. "Apparently it now
now is seeking to meet political ex
igencies by its naval program. But it
has imposed on the country an incom
petent naval administration. ' We ,de

western and eastern coasts. We de

SNEAK THIEF ESCAPED
' THRU RAIN OF SHOT
Messrs. Hiyes Guynn the ' North
Magnolia street merchants have been
missing good3 from their store at dif
ferent times lately, but only found out
last night just the route being employ
ed in getting away with them.
Early Monday morning when Mr.
Guynn opened up he noticed that a
number of articles were missing, and
a search inside and outside the place
revealed the hiding place of a gener
ously filled suit case under the rear
platform. He pulled it out and re
mo virrg its contents returned it to
its hiding place. He then notified an
officer who watched all day, without
results. Just after dark last even
ing, while Deputy Osteen was watch
ing for the return of the thief, a 'col
ored boy came into the alley way and
made his way directly to the hiding
place of the suit case. He secured
it and had started to leave when the
officer called for him to halt, but he
couldn't see it that way and started
to run. Mr. Osteen then fired two
barrels of a shot gun at him, but this
only frightened him into greater
speed. The officer then gave chase to
ward the vacant lots on North Orange
street, where the thief succeeded inV
dodging him, and finally made his es
cape westward on Ocklawaha avenue,
after six shots had been fired at him
by the pursuing deputy.
The burglar had been crawling be
tween the iron bars on the back win
dow which allow only room enough
for a small man's body to pass
through.
The Sunday night haul promised to
be a valuable one as over fifty dol
lars worth of goods, besides the suit
case had been scheduled for removal
on Monday night.
The shooting caused considerable
excitement for a time, some believ
ing that a company of Carranza's
soldiers had invaded our usually peace
ful city.
tition of "an energized Europe, it is
plain we must have protective, up
building policies." Other measures,
too, should be applied, he said, notably'
the upbuilding of a merchant marine.
To make peace lasting and effective
when the present war-shall end, Mr.
Hughes advocated the formation of
an international tribunal to dispose of
controversy of a justiciable court,
backed by the co-operation of the na
tions. Mr. Hughes also declared for the
"conservation of the just interests of
hibor," for conservation of national
resources and for a national budget.
"Our opponents promise economy,
but they have shown a reckless ex
travagance. It i3 time we had fiscal
reform," he said.
Mr. Hughes closed with ah endorfe
meht of the republican platform and a
formal acceptance of the nomination.
