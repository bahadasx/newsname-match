MAYOR IS IN NO
HURRY TO STOP
JITNEY TRAFFIC

36 CARS RUN TODAY
Nearly 40 Strikers Back Says
Davis; Thorpe Issues
Statement
"Until the cars can be operated
■without the aid o£ the more objec
tionable element of the strike-breakers
the city authorities will take no ac
tion relative to the regulation o£ the
unlicensed jitney traffic."
Mayor E. S. Meals made that state
ment to-day when asked why the jit
ney had not been brought to Council's
attention to-day.
The Mayor yesterdav said if he
were physically able to attend to-day's
session, he would invite City Solicitor
Seitz to confer with the commissioners
to-day relative to the jitney problem.
The Mayor, however, didn't turn up
at the council meeting and Mr. Seitz
said he had had no request as yet
to meet with the commissioners on
the subject nor to give any opinion.
The Mayor, however, said he ex
pected ot take up the question this
afternoon or to-morrow morning with
Mr. Seitz.
Mayor Explains Position
"Until we're certain that the public
can lpe satisfactorily accommodated
on the cars by experienced men and
not by some of the type of men who
have been employed as strike-break
ers, I can't see that it will be right
to the traveling public to take any
hand in the matter. Some of these
fellows, you know, aren't safe. As
soon as this matter can be regulated,
why then we'll take a hand in regulat
ing the jitneys. However, I expect to
take up this matter with Mr. Seitz
this afternoon or to-morrow," ex
plained the Mayor.
The strike situation, according to
both trolleymen's union and Harris
burg railways' officials, was at a stand
still.
The trolleymen contend that the
strike is still on as stiffly as ever, that
their union is solid now with 175 or
more men, that the trolley company is
having its own troubles now with the
strike-breakers who are eager to go
back to New York; that if there are
any new vacancies in the ranks of the
strikers, the delinquents are of the
weak-kneed variety which they would
consider it best to weed out.
Thirt.v-six Cars Run
The Railways Company officials de
clare that it operated thirty-six cars
to-day, less than the number in serv
ice yesterday, but reduced because the
company is trying its best to operate
with its own men only and not with
the strike-breakers. ■
Thirty-six of the men who had been
on strike, according to Felix M. Davis,
are now back at their old jobs and
four or five applications which had
been made to-day are under consid
eration.
Most AU Taken Back
With few exceptions practically all
the men who ask for their old posi
tions have been taken back. Some of
the striking plant firemen, however,
will not likely get their places, accord
ing to President Musser.
The trolleymen's union elected Ray
mond Arnold, treasurer, and A. B.
Wendler, financial secretary, to suc
ceed Harry Dalton and Charles C.
Page. The latter returned to the
company's employ and their books
were found to-day to be in satisfac
tory condition by an auditing commit
tee composed of H. E. Bowman, Amos
Titzel and E. C. Hicks.

Police Have Clue at
Last to Robberies, —
You Understand Me!
Sh-h-h-!
Careful, Watson! The Detective
Bureau now has a clue to the band
of petty thieves that has been preying
on Harrisburg for months, and we
mustn't disturb their deep meditations.
And, you understand me, Watson,
this is a "regular" clue; just the same
kind that aided our Sherlocks to (al
most ) forge a job-saving chain of
evidence about the alleged brutal
murderer of aged Mrs. Elizabeth Al
bright, and which really did aid in
sending Nick Kotur, Steelton murderer
to the death cell—to be brief, Watson,
it is a hat.
Do you understand me, Watson—
or is it Windsor—this is a hat left
behind by a member of that band of
burglars which raided so many up
town and Allison Hill homes? It was
exchanged for a new straw while the
mysterious owner made a visit to the
home of A. R. Michener, 466 Crescent
street, early this morning.
Incidentally, it might be added that
the owner of the hat ramsaciced draw
ers and dropped some hundred or
more burned matches and half-burned
twisted paper torches about the rooms
perfectly regardless of insurance risks.
Mother Killed by Stroke
of Lightning Surrounded by
Eleven Children Who Escape
Sunbury, Pa., Aug. 1. Mrs. Frank
Pardoe, 43 years old, was instantly
killed by lightning last night. A nine
days' old baby in a crib nearby was
unhurt and the woman's husband and
ten other children who were in the
same room escaped injury.
Little Boy Crushed Under
Wheels of Auto Truck
William John Kautz, aged 3, last
evening attempted to cross the street,
near his home, 610 Wiconisco street,
and in so doing was run down and
almost instantly killed by an automo
bile truck, owned by the Hershey
Creamery Company and driven by
Harry Miller.
Miller immediately surrendered
himself to the police but was released
pending the coroner's inquest, which
will be held to-morrow evening at 7
o'clock, in the courthouse.
The child was taken to the Harris
burg Hospital in the automobile of
Robert Willoughby, who was passing
when the accident occurred, where it
was found that the baby's head was
crushed.

New York, Aug. 1. "America first

This was the slogan with which
Charles E. Hughes last night formal
ly accepted the Republican nomination
for President before an enthusiastic
audience which thronged Carnegie
Hall to capacity. On the flag-decked
stage from which he enunciated the
Republican policies were gathered
three hundred leaders of the reunited
party from all sections of the country
and from a central tier box Theodore
Roosevelt applauded vigorously the
nominee's caustic criticism of the
Democratic administration.
Amid outbursts which at times ap
proached tumult, the nominee charac
terized the conduct of the Democrats
in the country's foreign relations as a
"lamentable sacrifice of National re
pute," and its course in Mexico dur
ing the past three years as a "travesty
of international policies." He laid the
blame for the existing condition of an
archy, murder and rapine in the ad

Hughes Declares For
Federal Suffrage Amendment
By Associated Press
New York, Aug. 1. Charles E.'
Hughes to-day declared for an amend- j
rnent to the Federal Constitution pro- i
vlding for woman suffrage. Mr. j
Hughes' views on the subject were I
made public in a letter he has written i
to Senator Sutherland, of Utah.
Mr. Hughes' letter to Senator George
Sutherland was in reply to a telegram
received from the senator asking the
nominee to define his personal position
with regard to the eciual suffrage Fed
era! amendment. Mr. Hughes replied
as follows:
"Your telegratn , has been received.
In my answer to the notification I did.
not refer to the proposed Federal
amendment relating to woman suf
frage, as this was not mentioned in
the platform. I have no objection,
however, to stating my personal views.
As I said in my speech, I think it to
be most desirable that the question
of woman suffrage should be settled
promptly. The question is of such a
nature that it should be settled for
the entire country.
"My view is that the proposed
amendment should be submitted and
ratified and the subject removed from
political discussion."
Mr. Hughes was asked to-day on the
reception given him when he delivered
his speech of acceptance. He said:
"To my mind It was a most gratify
ing reception. It seemed to me that it
showed most conclusively that there
was no misunderstanding with respect
to the issues of the campaign. We
have had art inadequate administra
tion and I think the American people
know it."

Beaver Falls, Pa., Aug. I.—"That

| Mr. and Mrs. Henry Du Prele, Repub-
I licans, of Beaver Falls, have made with
Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Greene, Demo
crats, of New Brighton, to take effect

Both Mr. and Mrs. Du Prele are

tum That Teutonic Defenses
Are Seriously Menaced
FLEEING FROM KOVEL
Germans Are Removing Heavy
Guns and Supplies; Evacuate
Another City
The Russian drivo on the eastern
front is attaining such momentum that
it is threatening to wreck the entire
Teutonic defensive line south of the
Pinsk marshes, according to unofficial
reports through Rome to-day.
Petrograd dispatches last night
credited the Russians unler General
Kaledines with having crossed the
river Stokhod in their advance toward
liovel, the key to the German positions
in Volhynia, along a 27-mile front be
tween Kovel-Sarny and Kovel-Rovno
railways. To-day's unofficial dis
patches report the removal by the Ger
mans of their heavy guns and supplies
from Kovel and the of
Vladimir-Volynski, 30 miles to the
southwest, which also is threatened
by the Russian advance westward from
Lutsk.
To the southward, in Galicla, the
success of General Sakharoff in cap
turing Brody is declared in unofficial
advices to have been followed up by
a Cossack raid which destroyed rail
ways behind the Austrian army,
threatening it with envelopment.
No Damage in Air Raid
Berlin dispatches express confidence
that the Teutonic resistance in the Ko
vel region will withstand the Russian
pressure, the new front to which the
Germans and Austrians have with
drawn west of the bend in the Stokhod
being 25 miles shorter than the old
one and considered far easier to de
fend.
The Turkish troops are urriving on
the eastern front, presumably in read
iness to be thrown into the counter
stroke against General Kaledines
which General Von Linsingen is plan
ning.
Several Zeppelins and a number of
aeroplanes are said to have taken
part in last night's air raid on the east
