the discovery of a cure for Infantile

for definite "conclusions It may be said
that two distinct, though somewhat

which have met with results that the

quantity of fluid has been withdrawn
from the spine, i the convalescent

' At a meeting of ; Fairfield county

ducers, and to be supervised by the

It is expected that the sense of the
meeting tonight wilt be that the milk
men raise the quality of their milk and
obtain a better price for it.
"To my mind, that 1b the solution
ot this,; problem," said William C.

infantile paralysis were broken today.
During the 2.4 hour period ending at
10 a. nv'the plague killed 67 children
in the greater city and 159 new cases
were reported by the health depart

In Brooklyn alone the disease claim-
ed 34 victims. Twelve died In Man

Health experts fighting the epidemic
said that with the return of cooler

Mayor Seeks to Prevent
General Trolley Strike in
New York.
- New York, Aug. lr-Sty officials
fear that the street railway companies
operating surface lines in this city are
nearing a deadlock with labor leaders
and a general strike is believed Im
minent. . -
Already thousands of people are
compelled to, walk because of ' the
strike of employes of the Third Ave
nue Railway. Officials of . the New
York Railways Co., which operates a
large jKircentage of the street railway
lines of the city, said today that ef
forts had been made by the Amalga
mated Association of the Street Rail
way and Electric Employes to extend
the strike to all motormen and con
ductors. . 'i
: A tie UP of this system would de
prive Manhattan of virtually of all its
surface transportation. In an effort
to avert an extension of the strike.

To Ask Police Board to Es

EVERY CORNER HAS
DIFFERENT SYSTEM
Motorists From Other Cities
Greatly Confused When
Driving Here.
At the meeting of the Automobile
Club of Bridgeport which will be held
in - , September, President John C.
Stanley and the board of police com
missioners will be asked to establish
a definite and simple code of signals
for the traffic policemen. Attention
of the commissioners will also be call
ed to the conduct of the traffic police
men. It Is alleged that 'many of them
are anything but courteous and that
they often use profane language to
motorists who misunderstand their
signals. ' j ' ,
There is no understood code of sig
nals .in use' by the 'Bridgeport police
men performing traffic duty. Some
police use a whistle to signify tljat
the street is open from . the - opposite
direction, hut whistles are hot used
by all the policemen. Others have a
fashion of . waving one hand in the
air and the other by then- side at the
same time. Each traffic officer has
a. set of signals of. his own and the
signals are very confusing and es
pecially so to .motorists who come
from cities where a set code is in
.vogue. -.. - '
In Scranton,. Pa., ' a "code which is
very easy for the stranger to under
stand is. in vogue. When the street is
open In either direction the traffic offi
cer simply extends both arms horizon
tally like the position taken by a sol
dier or. sailor in beginning the sema
phore , signal code. . .
In a number of large cities through
out the. country including New York,
the traffic" policemen have - signal
stands' beside their stations which
they turn in the direction from whjch
the traffic ' approaches u Wishing to
close the street the policeman turns a
sign which reads "Stop." To open- it
he - turns'' a sign which reads -'Drive
.Oh.", ..-,' ',Ji ' , - "' .
"Members of the Automobile club M
Meve it will be for the better interest
of the service as well as for the better"
interest of the traveling public if traf
fice policemen - are taught a definite
code of signals. -

BUILDING TRADES
ELIMINATE OPEN
SHOP PLAN HERE
Virtually All Contractors In
Accord With Plans of Un
ion Organization.
The Bridgeport hullding trades have
won their fight against the open shop.

ing of the association, i '

Decorators, local 170; Plumbers &
Steam fitters, local 1173; Sheetmetal
Workers, local 114,' and the Lathers
and the Slate And Tile Workers.
As a result - of .the agreements all
worK must now be done under union
rules 'and regulations. Though the
larger cpntractors have for the past
year or more been under agreement
with the " Bridgeport Building Trades
Council and individual unions,' there

conditions existed here than in any

only piece of ' work in this city now
being done upon, the open shop plan
and administration heads are blamed
