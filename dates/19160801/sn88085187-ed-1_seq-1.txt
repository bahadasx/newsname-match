I "EMPTY I 1
I WORDS" J
BY THE EDITOR
tj My outstanding impression after a faith
ful leading of Candidate Hughes' acceptance
Speech is that he has delivered the rompaign
<ry of "Empty words!'' over to his adver
saries,
<J In a studied oratorical effort that re
quires columns of small newspaper type to
record, he has produced not one forward
looking, constructive idea.
*_ He has cited not one valid reason why
Woodrow Wilson should be displaced, nor
why Charles Evans Hughes should be sent
to the nation's helm.
% His widely-heralded speech is purely a
speech of destructive criticism. Its ablest
and most convincing passage is his indict*
Kent of the president's Mexican policy.
Even there he is tlie office-seeking candi
date Either than the statesman or Ihe fair
minded judge, for he withholds praise for
Wilson's many undisputed achievements in
Mexican affairs, while bitterly attacking
him for his errors.
% Nor does Hughes tell the country what
HIS Mexican policy would be, nor give any
guarantee against his committing Mexican
mistakes quite as numerous and grievous as
Wilson has heen guilty of.
<J Emptier yet arc his words on such sub
jects as labor, conservation, suffrage, the
Philippines and tariff. Balanced state
ments, all of them, designed to conceal the
Speaker's meaning, rather than to elucidate
it! What are Hughes' convictions on these
subjects . You must look elsewhere to learn,
the speech docs not set them forth. The
words are worse than empty, they are
"weasel."
m_ The address will be a disappointment to
every progressive minded citizen. For it is
a typical old-style harangue designed purely
to catch votes.

The deadlock In the grand jury
appears to be no nearer solution
Monday than It was when the In
vestigation of the strike situa
tion began.
Throughout the entire morning
the probers balloted behind
closed doors, only to adjourn
shortly before noon without re
porting to the court any results
of the investigation of the fatal
shooting at the east end of the
11th street bridge.
Moanwhlla Deputy Prosecutor
Phelps was busy scouting through
the city in an automobile trying
to run down a witness said to be
able to Identify the person who
fired the shot that killed Rang
wald Letnnan.
All the witnesses so far have
been unable, or have refused, to
Identify the slayer. The prose
cutor's supposed clue is reported
to be the last resort in obtaining
Indictments in the case.
Up to noon, Phelps had been
unable to locate the wanted wit

THE PRICE SOCIETY
MADE BICES PAY
By the Editor
Usually the important, the
thrilling, the dramatic, the
tragic and the merely human
news stories of the day pass
through the consciousness of
an editor, leaving little per
sonal impress.
In the concentration of
getting the written account
into Ills editions, an editor
has no time to register the
usual human emotions for
any but fleeting instants.
But once in a while a
story strikes home. And
when It does, I believe, It
hits the editor a little bit
harder than anybody else.
Thus, this pleasant August
forenoon am i stricken to the
quick by the news that Sam
Bridges Is dead -a suicide.
Not that I ever was num-
bered among Sam Bridges'
close friends, for my ac
quaintance with him, though
dating back perhaps 10
years, was casual.
As a youthful reporter, I
remember meeting him years
ago when he was an attache
of Judge Hanford's federal
court. Suave, competent,
reserved, yet cordial, he
challenged my interest.
Some years passed. Bridges
became head of the office
where he had been a subor
dinate, and in the slow mu
tation of newspaper advance
ment.! developed from cub
reporter into a full-fledged
* one, then into a sub-editor.
Five years ago I sinned.
as that particular newspaper
classified reporters' sins, and
was urgently requested to
resign. N
A few minutes later,
walking along (he street and
pondering over the ways of
providence, I encountered
Bridges.
He confided In me that
he, too, had just lost his po
sition.
We held a mutual sympa
thy . tension and parted, I
for a newapaper Job In Los
Angel ea, and he, as I learned
later, to face a serious court
charge and to spend many
months on McNeils Island.
Another whirl of time
hronght us both back to Ta
roma, he a discharged con
vict and I an editor. And
by para coincidence It found
as occupying apartments In
the same tier of the same
building.
He was a vastly changed
Sam Bridges. Outwardly,
lie was as suave, as co.ii|ie
tesnt. as reserved et as cor
dial, as before. That .«•,
when he met you and spoke.
Bl'T HE PREFERRED
NOT TO MEET YOU. HE
FEARED I.ONESOMENESB,
YET HE FEARED. APPAR
ENTLY, EVEN MORE THE
EYES OF HIS OLD ASBOCI-
A T E 8. QUESTIONING
EYES, I PRESUME, HE
FELT THEM TO BE.
I have seen him In recent
months meet my three-year
old youngster in Wright
park or on a stair landing,
and the sight made my soul
ache.
It was so evident that Sam
Bridges was throwing the
whole force of the in-aul.il. '•
loveable side of his oi'a
nature Into an effort to gala
the child's warm friend
ship.
It was as If he felt that
here, at least, was a human
being who would accept
him for what he was at that
minute and who would raise
no recollections or the pain
ful past.
So It comes about that
there is one rosy spot, at
least, In my contemplation
of Sam Bridges' sad career.
It is the knowledge that In
his heart-touching campaign
to make friends with a wee
boy, his efforts were ;
crowned with siicces*. The
hearty greetings and the -
warm smile> of an uncon- >
taininuted baby I cart. I -
know, were dearer than gold
to him.
