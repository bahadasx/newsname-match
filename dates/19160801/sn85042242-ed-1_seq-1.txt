Quiet Little Village of Steele Is
Scene of Tragedy Last Satur­
day Evening.
^JOAUSB FOR DEED
IS A MYSTERY
J. G. T. StauffackerGoeg to Res-
cue and Receives Bullet
Wound 1q Side.
The quiet little village of Steele
was thrown in an uproar last (Satur­
day evening over a triple shooting
that occurred about 5 o'clock, about
a mile and a half from the village
center, at the farm house owned by
J. G. L. Stauffacher, a well known
and highly respected citizen of that
community.
The shooting was done by one Vic­
tor Browash, who has been located
in that vicinity for some time, com­
ing there from Wisconsin. Coming to
the kitchen door of the Stauffacher
farm house, Browash presented a .22
caliber revolver at his wife, who was
in the employ of Mr. Stauffacher, and
fired point blank at her head. The
bullet struck her in the forehead and
lodged there. Her employer interced­
ed in an attempt to save the life of
Mrs. Browash and received a bullet
wound in the side during the strug­
gle that ensued.
Commits Suicide.
iBrowash evaded Mr. Stauffacher
and, dashing outside, fired four shots
at himself, three bullets taking ef­
fect.' When picked up he was found
to be in a dying condition, one bullet
having lodged in his chest, one in the
lower extremity of his jaw.and the
third hitting him in the temple. He
was given medical attention at once,
but all efforts to save his life Were
unavailing and he died at 1 o'clock
Sunday morning.
Dr. Lodge of Steele attended Mrs.
Browash and succeeded in dislodging
the bullet from her forehead. Her
condition is? reported as very favor-
Mr.' Stauffacher felt no ill effects
from the Would he received in the
side and came to Bismarck Sunday
and was given an X-ray examination
yesterd&y at the St. Alexius hospital.
His wound: was probed and the bul­
let removed. He is feeling fine, after
his eiciting experience, and expects
to be able'to return to his home in a
few days.
Mf. Stauffacher is considered a he­
ro by his neighbors and others ac­
quainted with the facts in the case.
Had he not intercepted Browash,
there is no doubt that he would have
carried out his intention of first kill­
ing his wife before doing away with
himself.
No Reason For Deed.
As far as can be learned there is
no reason that can be attributed to
his actions. A few days prior to the
shooting he complained of not feeling
well, stating that he was of the opin­
ion he had a slight attack of appendi­
citis. MB. Stauffacher suggested that
he gb kotismarck and enter a hospi­
tal for treatment and the man went
away with the intention of following
out this advice.
Mrs.iBrowash has been in the em­
ploy afr_ Mr. Stauffacher for several
yeate-and. it was while she .was con­
nected. with the Stauffacjier family
that she. became the wife of Browash.
Acording to Mr. Stauffacher, Browash
new. .made a pretense .pf caring for
his spouse and left her in his employ
whiles *e$»tinued his travels from
one point to another. _•
Saturday morning he appeared at
the farmhouse and announced that he
had decided to go back to bis home
in Wisconsin for medical treatment
for the ailment he seemed to think
had afflicted him. Mrs. Browash, real­
izing that financial conditions would
not permit this course, told him to
journey to Bismarck and sh? would
remain at the Stauffacher residence
^nd attend to her duties. Browash
Went away, apparently satisfie i, but
returned about 5 o'clock in the even­
ing and demanded that she come with
him to Wisconsin. Mr. Stauffacher
was reading in the room adjoining
the kitchen and heard the conversa­
tion between the two and then heard
a shot and Mrs. Browash scream, ''I'm
shot," and came running into tl
room occupied by the Stauffacher
family with her husband close on her
heels. Browash was intent on finish­
ing his wife and it was at this junc­
ture that Mr. Stauffacher came to the
rescue as mentioned before and re­
ceived the wound in hil side, although
he kept Browash from completing the
deed he had set out for himself.
It was one of the most startling
crimes that has been committed in
Steel for many years and the resi­
dents of the community were greatly
excited over the affair.

Relief From
The Heat
Yesterday
Weather reports yesterday indicated
that the heat wave had passed. The
maximum yesterday was 84.
The lack of rain and the low tem­
perature is unfavorable to rapid
spread of rust, and although consid­
erable damage, acording to reports
from most sections of the state, has
already been done, this favorable
change may mean an increased yield
of millions of bushels of wheat.
Experts declare that at the same
time it is not unfavorable to corn, as
much lower temperature would be.
"BERMUDA HIGH"
IS lABOUT SPENT
Washington, July 31.—A Canadian
high pressure area, bringing down
cool air from the Canadian northwest
swept along the whole of the north­
ern United States today and afforded
some relief from the hot wave, which
has bef&i the worst in 15 years.
Roughlyj the new high pressure area
brought a drop in temperature every­
where north of a line drawn due west
from fvew York. E'elow this line its
effects were felt in some districts
with a change of a few degrees.
The "Bermuda high," which for the
past ten days has been sweeping up
currents of high water-laden air from
the tropics over the whole of the con­
tinental United States, showed signs
today of having pretty well spent it­
self.

Prison Officials Will Try to Dis­

in 60 Days.
TO Bif QUESTIONED
Glendlve, Mont., July 31.—Three
men were picked up here today
by Northern Pacific special
agents. Their descriptions tally
closely with those of the men who
escaped Saturday from the North
Dakota state penitentiary. Spe­
cial Agent Murphy is coming to
identify the men.
A searching investigation of condi­
tions at the penitentiary that are re­
sponsible for the 17 escapes in two
months will be made by the board of
control, in co-operation with Warden
Talcott.
Two guards were ordered to search
the cars just before the train pulled
out. Two other guards watched the
cars from the outside and two other
guards were outside the grounds
watching for escapes.
in the investigation to be made,
both guards and convicts will 'be ask­
ed to tell their stories without fear
of being punished for anything they
may say.
None of the three prisoners who es­
caped had been captured up to an
early hour this morning, although the
men ate following a clue which they
believe will result in their early cap­
ture.
El Paso,. July 31.—American sol­
diers, reinforced by a small detach­
ment of Carranzistas, engaged Mexi­
can bandits who had crossed the Rio
Grande into the United States, about
five miles {below Fort Hancock, Tex.,
55 miles east of here early today. Two
Americans were killed and one was
wounded, while three of the outlaws
were killed and two escaped across
the river into Mexico, and are now
being pursued by Mexican troops and
a detachment of the Carranxa custom
guard. Upon receiving reports from
Robert Wood, a United States custom
inspector, that the bandits, who had
committed numerous depredations on
the Mexican Bide of the frontier, re­
cently had crossed the border, six
men of Troop F, 8th U. S. cavalry and
a hospital corps under Lieut. Charles
Telford, with Wood and Customs In­
spector Bean, rode to the abandoned
adobe hut where the Mexicans were
said to be in hiding.
The bandits opened fire from the
building and adjoining outhouses, kill­
ing Wood and Private John Towney
and wounding Sargent Lewis Thomp­
son In the shoulder.
Bean, fearing that the Mexicans
would escape the small American de­
tachment, called upon the Carranzis­
tas commander on the opposite side
of the river. He responded with a
A
Republican Nominee Declares for
New Policy of Firmness and
Consistency.
DENOUNCES ALL
ALIEN INTRIGUES
"Weakness and Inexpertness,"
Features of Democratic
Foreign Policies.
New York, July 31.—Charles E.
Hughes tonight outlined in his speech
of acceptance the issues upon which
he' will conduct his campaign for the
presidency.
Mr. Hughes assailed the administra­
tion for the course it haB pursued'
with reference to Mexico, mainten­
ance of American rights during the
European war, preparedness and oth­
er great questions of the day. He de­
clared for a new policy qf "firmness
and consistency" toward Mexico, for
"the unflinching maintenance of all
American rights on land and sea" and
for "adequate national defense."
"Adequate protection on both our
western and eastern coasts."
Denounces Plots.
"We denounce all plots and conspir­
acies in the interest of any foreign
nation," Mr. Hughes said. "Utterly
intolerable is the use of our soil for
alien intrigues. Every American must
unreservedly condemn them, and sup­
port every effort for their suppres­
sion."
The nominee criticised, the admin­
istration for its direction of diplomat­
ic intercourse, from the beginning, de­
claring that where there should have
been conspicuous strength and ex
pertness there had been weakness
and inexpertness. He cited San Do­
mingo as an instance, where appoint­
ments had, gone to "deserving demo-
Ambassador Herrjck at his post in
Paris after the war had started, as
"a lamentable sacrifice of internation­
al repute."
Endorses Woman Suffrage.
"I will endorse the declaration in
the platform in favor of woman's suf­
frage," Mr. Hughes declared. And
he added:
"Opposition may delay, but, in my
judgment, cannot defeat this move
ment. I favor the vote for women."
Delves Into Mexican Question.
One-fourth of the speech was de­
voted to Mexico. Step after step tak­
en by the administration with refer­
ence to Mexico was assailed. From
the days of Huerta to the note sent
the de facto government by the state
department June 20 last, part of
which was quoted in the speech. The
seizure of Vera Cruz, the nominee
said, "was war, of course."
"Later, we retired from Vera Cruz,"
he continued, "giving up this noble
warfare. Recently the naked truth
was admitted by1 a cabinet officer. We
are now informed that we did. not go
to Vera Cruz to force Huerta to sa­
lute the flag. We are told we went
there to 'show Mexico that we were
in earnset in our demands that Huer­
ta must go.'
"America," Mr. Hughes continued,
"had no policy of aggression toward
Mexico, no desire for any part of her

into the United States in a position to
cut off the outlaws' retreat, the inci­
dent marking the first time the Car­
ranzistas soldiers have
co-operated
with Americans in pursuit of bandits
on American soil.
After three of the five Miexicans
had (been killed, however, the two re­
maining bandits eluded both the
American and Carranzistas detach­
ments and made their way across the
river to the American side, followed
by the Mexican government soldiers,
who are pursuing them into the des­

That Carranzistas and United States
troops fought side by side against
Mexican bandits south of Fort Han­
cock, Tex., early today was emphasiz­
ed in the official report from Briga­
dier General Bell to Major General
Funston tonight.
A Carranza caiptain and eight sol­
diers responded to the American re­
quest for aid. The report says the
bandits left behind four dead. I

New York, July 31.—Fire broke out
tonight among the ruins on Black

partment of Jersey City, with fire
boats from New York and iNew Jer­
sey, fought the flames, which center­
ed about a pier where large quanti­
ties of shrapnel and cartridges were
stored. Shells exploded in an almost
continuous cannonade. With three
officers of corporations doing busi­

rest and a warrant out for a fourth,
preparations were under way at Jer­
sey City for a joint federal, state,
county and municipal investigation to
fix the blame for Sunday morning's

MERCHANT DEAD.
Minneapolis, July 31.—John W.
Thomas, last of the pioneer merch­
ants of Nicollet avenue, head of the

& Co., died at 12:30 a. m. Saturday at
his home, 2013 Stvens avenue.
For 33 years he had been a conspic­
uous figure in the business life of
Minneapolis. He had long been a
leader in the city's civic progress and
was well known for the time and mon­
ey he devoted to philanthropic pur­
poses.
The theory that the fire, which
caused the disastrous explosion start­
ed on a munitions barge tied up at
the island was combatted today by
Robert S. Hudspeth, prosecutor for
Hudson county, and Theodore John­
son, president of the Johnson Light­
erage company, owner of the muni­
tions barge. Both declared the fire
originated in two Lehigh Valley rail­
road freight cars, laden with explos­
ives.
Johnson, who was arrested on a
warrant charging manslaughter, as
was Albert Hickman, Black Tom
agents of the Lehigh Valley, and Al­
exander Davidson, superintendent of
the National Storage company, denied
all responsibility of the conflagration.
He intimated the fire was of incendi­
ary origin.
