Making a Name
For a Town
1 he citizens of every town have it
within their power to make or mar
their own municipal name, It will
be good or bad, just as they choose
to make it.
We of, this town are no exceptions
to the rule, and the citizen who lovesUjctures as the raeaua of reach
i. i ...:it ........ I.... u . . . .
his own home will always bear it in
mind.
There are many good points in fa
vor of our community, and when the
stranger comes to our midst we should
not fail toinipre;s these facts upon his
mind
We should take him in hand, ex
hibit the commun ty as you would
a blooded horse, let him understand
that he is among a fair minded, en
ergetic and generous hearted people,
and when he goes to other climes he
will peak as he has been spoken to.
That is the way reputations are
made.
But there is another tide, and it is
there that mischief is too often done
The strnager enters out door and
we immediately begin to complain of
the community aiuL of the people.
Nothine is as it should De; t verv-
thing is wrong and the tosvn is on
the way to the dogs. , ,
And again the stranger speaks as
he sees and hears.
That is the way reputations are de

AND CAUSES IMMENSE LOSS
New York, July 24. Property
loss estimated at $25,000,000 was
caused early todayby a series of ter
rific explosion of ammunition await
ing shipment to the Entente Allies
and stored on Black Tom Island, a
small strip ot land jutting into New
York Bay off Jersey City. The loss
of life still was problematical tonight.
It will no be determined definitely
until there has been opportunity to
check up the workmen employed on
the island and on boats moored
nearby.
Two are known to be dead, and at
least two more are missing. Scores
of persons were injured, some of
them probably fatally.
The detonations, which were felt
in five states, began with a continu
ous rapid fire of small shells, then
the blowing up of large quantities of
dynamite, trinitrotluene and other
high . explosives, followed by the
bursting of thousands of sharpnel
shells, which literally showered the
surrounding country and waters for
many miles around.

Englshart, Ont , July 30. Forest
fires raging in Northern Ontario are
believed tonight to have resulted in
the loss of from one hundred and
fiftv to two hundred lives. Scores
of persons also have been injured,
and it is feared many of them may
die.
Several small towns have been
wiped out bv the flames that have
been raging for forty-eight hours.

fifty seven perished at Mushka, a
French Canadian settlement, and
thirty four at Matheson. ;

thirty-four injured; Iroquois Fall has
fifteen dead and many injured, and
Ramore, fifteen dead.
The number killed at Porcupine
Junction is not known, but the entire
town was destroyed; except the rail
road station.
The death list will be materially
increased it is feared, by victims in
outlaying districts. There are ap
parently well authenlicaled reports
that many prospectors Have been
trapped at Tashota and Kowash.
One farmer and his ten children are
known to have been burned, while
the man's wife vainly was seeking aid
to check the onrushing flames.

Summer Time
Sweets and Oilier
Good Thlni$
Sometimes I think that a good")
dessert is the very first test of
housekeepers table. It is an , unnecrl
essary part of the menu and, 'beipjn
thus entirely a luxury, it must be ai
very perfect one to fill as it should; '
the difficult role of a dainty that is
wholesome and reasonable sweety i
yet not too sweet; rich, yet not loc I
ich; tempting, yet not too tempting;
and in all exactly adequate to the saM
isfying ofgthe renewed eagerness off
appetite that its appearance suggests.
It goes almost without saying thai
summer time desserts must Joe ngnr,
or that if heavy, theyshould take thi
place of heavier dishes in the earl;
parts of the menus. Never jet yoi
desserts, in summer of all tjmes i
the year, be "just that much tc
much,"
Among ideal desserts right now art
fruit jellies. They are always gooff
and are particularly light and refresh!
ing. Remember, when making thesfil
that your gelatin must always ty
soaked in cold water before being di
solved in hot, and that your sug !
must be used according to the acid i i
the fruit, some fruits requiring mo,
than others. One Iralf cup to a pit
is a good a erage proportion.
Lemon jelly is delicious made e
the ordinary way, and then, when a).
most cold, poured over the halves
fresh, Qrm peaches, eithei in indivkf

dish. Other combinations uf frui
