the Teutonic line from the Dnister river to Koropietzf
ana eisewnere along tne eastern tront, have pressed the
Germans and Austrians hard, according to today's war
office statement.
Heavy counter attacks from Kovel and Luzk were re
pulsed after the Russians had attacked in the region of
Tchekhuv and Dubenekjj. Crossing the Dneister toward
Koropietz was accomplished despite destruction of
bridges by retreating Germans, the czar's troops wading
across, reaching the west bank of the swollen stream and
taking 1,000 of the enemy prisoners.
The German line was again bent backward in the bend
of the Stockhod in the region of Velicki and Kuchary.
Flooded fields, mushy swamps and barbed wire en
tanglements partly submerged, have failed to stop the
Russian advance across the Stockhod river north of
Kovel. German positions which the Teuton commanders
fiave spent months in perfecting are succumbling daily to
the Russian assaults.
The enveloping movement around Kovel is proceeding
step by step. General Kaledin's forces have negotiated

Holds Mrs. Finley Was En
titled to Pension From
Application
The mothers' pension law and its
status under the laws of 1913 and 1D1S
is interpreted by tho supreme court in
an opinion handed down this morning in
the case of Mnry Luclln Finley, re
spondent, vs. County or Marion,' on ap
peal from the judgment of Circuit
Judge Galloway.
.Mrs. Finley filed for a pension under
the mothers' law of 1913, setting forth
that her husband was entirely incap
able of supporting her and her sou, then
about eight years old. Being of the
opinion that the petitioner was not en-1
titled to the reliet sought, by reason pt
the fact that she was at work which
kept her away from home much of the
day and for other causes not necessary
to mention, the county court took no
action on the petition until July 30,
1015, when it entered an order deny
ing the same, but gave other relief.
Mrs. Finley then uppealed the case to
the circuit court, and Judge Galloway
decided she wus entitled to a widow's
pension, but held she was guilty of i investigation which showed that ap
laches in not compelling the juvenile proximately two million pounds of ex
court to act upon licr petition sooner ! plosives are handled at the Black Tom

Industrial Commission
Finds Conditions in Mesaba
Bad as Those in Colorado
Washington, Aug. 1. "It is a story
of public authority prostituted to pri
vate interests that is hardly equalled
by Colorado," declared a report of the
committee on industrial relations to
day, describing the strike of Mesaba
raiige iron workers. Duluth, St. Louis
county and Minnesota state officials
were raked severely by George P.
West, who wrote the report of the
Colorado strike for the United Stntes
commission on industrial relations.
'"The city of Duluth, the county of
St. Louis, anil the state of Minnesota
as represented by Governor Burnquist
and other public officials, have joined
hands in a relentless effort to crush
out the strike 15,000 miners," declared
the report.
M ore than 1000 men Lave been
deputized according to the sheriff's
own statement anS armed with ear
bines, revolvers and riot sticks. The
slums of Ihiluth h ve been combed to
recruit this army of gunmen. Sheriff
Meining like Jeff Farr of Colorado, ad
mitted thnt he had deputized the com
pany guards without investigation as
to their character or record. In fact,
he admitted, some of them 'might pos
sible be what the writer told him they
looked like thugs.'
Duluth Against Miners.
"Business Duluth is doing its bit.

between Prosecutor Hudspeth and Com
missioner of Public Safety Hague of

ficials, at least two presidents of rail
roads with Jersey City terminals are
concerned.
These officials, before the expected
arrests today, refused to say whether
the men would be charged with man
slaughter as were the three men arraign
ed and held in $5,000 bail yesterday or
whether they would merely be charged
with violation of statutes regarding
shipments and storing of ammunition
and explosion.

LloYds Hit Hardest.
While Hudspeth's immediate desire
is to prosecute alleged violations, his ul
timate aim is to force munitions mak
ers and railroads to find -some other
place than Black Tom, or, in fact, the

PREPAREDNESS AND THE

By Perry Arnold
(United Press stuff correspondent)
New Vork, Aug. 1. Charles Evans
Hughes' "keynote" for the coming
campaign pleased all republicans to
dny. Party chiefs who ussembled to
hear the former justice formnlly ncccpt
the nomination last night were unani
mous todny in praising the striking
sentences with which the candidate out
lined the issues on which the G. O. P.
is to start eviction proceedings ngainst
Woodrow Wilson and the democratic
majority in the senate and house.
The fact that 4,000 men and women
sat for nearly three hours in swelter
ing, sizzling lient to hear tile nominee
break another one of his famous si
lences in the meeting at Carnegie hull
wus looked ujion by republicans today
as auguring well for success in No
vember. Moreover, the same sticky,
sweating auditors had enough enthusi
asm left nt the end of that session in
the close air of the hall to cheer
Hughes vociferously. Tb(iy woiild
have heard something from Roosevelt,
but the former Moose, playing "sec
ond fiddle" at u political gathering
for the first time in o great many
years, hustled out or the hall.
Tried to Please All
Hughes' speech pleased today be
cause, in the view of his friends, he
supported his harmony plea with a se
lection of the issues for the campaign
which combine views of republican
standpatters, republican liberals aad
progressives. The "old liners" were
pleased with a ringiug protection dec
laration on the tariff; the liberals with
the labor, conservation and adminis
tration's efficiency sections in his up
braiding of the Wilson administration,
and the bull moosers with the "Ameri
canism" creed, the preparedness plat
form and the Mexican discussion.
Iieimblicans and democrats alike to
day were convinced thnt Hughes' prin
cipal issue in his fight against Wilson
will be tho Mexican situation.
The second line offensive will be
bombardment along the lines of "ad
equate" preparedness and tiie tariff.
Nearly eight years ago, Hughes ac
cepted the gubernatorial nomination in
Madison .Square Garden. At that time
and in the campaign which followed he
was adjudged one or the best earn
iiaitniers New York had ever Been,
Considerably grayer of beard and inoro
linld last night than on that other
night of acceptance, Hughes exhibited
no diminution of vigor in his stumping
ability, in the opinion of t'.iose who
knew him in other days.
On his trans-continental trip start
ing Saturday, his supporters expect
him to uive the country a sample or
the sort of campaigning that made him
famous in the gubernatorial race.

tion, adding "if I can pull off what I
am planning, I will be the biggest man
in Ban Francisco labor circles." Thi

which proved aborativc, to start a Uni
