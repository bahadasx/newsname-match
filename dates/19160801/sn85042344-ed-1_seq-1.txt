WASHINGTON, July 31. A Cana
dian high pressure area, bringing down
cool dry air from the Canadian north
west, swept along the whole of north
ern I'nited States today and afforded
some relief from the beat wave,
which lias been the worst in 15 years.
Koughly, the new high pressure area
brought a drop in temperature every
where north of a line drawn due west
from New York, lielow this line its
effects were felt In some districts with
a change of a few degrees.
The Bermuda high, which for the
past ten days has been sweeping up
currents of hot, water-laden air from
the tropics on the whole of conMnental
Cnited Stutes, showed sings today of
having pretty well spent its effect.
Likewise the high pressure area which
brought relief to the Atlantic seaboard
from Hudson bay over the week-end
has been dissipated.
Weather bureau officials said today
that wbilo the great central sections
of the country had had the hottest
period since 1901, the Atlantic sea
board hardly had been touched by
real summer.

until a temperature of 104 degrees

"Partly cloudy for today," was the
verdict of tho weather man. How
ever, no assurance is given that there
will be any surcease, from tho scorch
ing rays that have cooked the city
for the past 34 days, but on the other
hand it is not set out that higher
temperatures may be expected.
Sunday was no exception to the
rule. The city was baked and one
prostration was reported. E. Hall of
Sapulpa, a Krisco fireman, was taken
from his engine In this city after hav

WASHINGTON, July 3 1. Alt hough
the l ulled States government has ile
clined formally to order extraordinary
protection for the German merchant
.submarine DeulscliUind as she passes
out of American territorial waters,
state department officials indicated to
day thai if the submarine was en
dangered by a large number of cialt
attempting to follow her down
Chesapeake bay from llaltimore, a
coast guard cutler probably would in
terfere. It him been understood that
the Dcutsitiland's commander fears
he will bo seriously handicapped in his
efforts to escape to sea pa-st thy
waiting allied cruisers if he is fol
lowed by a fleet of boats carrying
newspaper correspondents, photog
raphers and sighlseers. llercto!ore
officials have indicated that this
could not be prevented, but Acting
Secretary Polk said today that tins
treasury department would consider
supervising the submarine's departure
under the same authority that it pro
vides patrols for congested yacht race
courses. Secretary of the Navy Daniels
said today that no further warships
would be assigned to neutrality duty
off the Virginia coast, the present
patrol by the armored cruiser N f 111

sufficient.

EL PASO, Texas, July 31. Ameri

Mexican bandits who had crossed the

about five miles below Kort Hancock,
Texas, f5 miles east of here larly to

I'pon receiving reports from Hubert

saiil to be hilling.
After being surrounded, the bandits
opened tire from the building ami ad
joining outhouses, killing Wood, pri
vate John Twoney, and wounding
Serreant Louis Thompson In the
shoulder. Dean, fearing that the Mexi
cans would escape the small Ameri
can detachment, called upon the Car
ranista commander on the opposite
side of the river, lie responded with
a score of soldiers, crossing the river
i'lto the United States to cut off the
outlaws' retreat, the incident mark
ing the first time Carran.ista soldiers

"We left Hancock at 4 o'clock this

"At that moment I heard the click

I jumped around the corner of the

are the literacy test amendment
passed at the last special session of
the legislature, and the resolution to
repeal sis tion 12-A of the coiisliutioli,
known as "Campbell Kussill's tax
scheme." Due to the fad that Tulsa
county schools will suffer irreperablc
loss if 12-A should become vitalized,
li uuunimous vole for the repeal id'
the section is anticipated in this
county. The literacy amendment,
purely a dishonest election measure,
Will also be defeated in this county
and throughout the stale voters
have been well-posted on the tricky

Campbell Russell, candidate for cor.
poration commissioner, is slated to se
cure the nomination, according to
Democratic lenders throughout the
state, but It is doubtful if he will re
ceive much of a vote in this county,
on account of his e'Tatic and unsound
taxation theories and his opposition to
the oil interests of tho state. Ilenry
Wilmering will get a big vote for this
place here, as will lien Harrison,
former secretary of state.
This entire scctlonof the state Is
expected to roll up a big vote for
Erank A. Parkinson of liiwton for
