THREE 0BJECT8 ATTAINED.
What Japan and Rusaia Gain By Re
cently Concluded Alliance.
Tokio, Aug. 1.—Three chief objects
are attained by the recently concluded
alliance between Japan and Russia, ac
cording to the ideas of well informed
political circles in Japan.
The first is the mutual elimination of
the menace of hostilities between the
two empires, which has existed for
over half a century.
The second is the strengthening of
each other's hand in dealing with the
situation in China, and the affiliation of
their special interests in that country.
The third is the relieving of Russia's
anxiety as to the protection of her
rights and spheres of influence in the
far east and the consequent strength
ening of her power to concentrate' on
the Balkan situation and in Persia,
which she believes vitally to concern
her future.

SHOE PRICE8 TO 80AR.
Manufaoturara^Announce War Prlc'ea
Will Pravail Next Winter.
St. Louis, Aug. 1.—St.. Louis shoe
manufacturers announce that the pub
lic will have to pay 10 to 20 per cent
more for Bhoes this fall and whiter.
It was said shoes which heretofore
have been sold at from $2 to $4.50 a
paid, will cost 50 to 75 cents more,
while 95, and $7 shoes will average
a dollar higher.
Jackson Johnson, head of one of the
large shoe manufacturing companies
here, gave as the principal causes 'for
the increase in prices the heavy export
:'vt£ VV
-'V
'Vi'":
y::''
of shoes to the countries at war, scarc
ity of raw hides from those countries
and a scarcity of ships to bring raw
materials to the United States.
The official added that there was no
relief in sight, and that the public
should prepare for a continued gradual
Increase in the price of shoes for an
indefinite period, even for some time
after the close of the war.
"Kid and calf skins, used in the
manufacture of high grade shoi s, are
up from 50 to 100 per cent, and, owing
to the war, we could not possibly get
enough of these skins to supply this
country for two months," he said.
"Kids come from India, the Balkan
states, South America and China. The
Balkans have a part in the war, and
ships are not available to trtinsport
skins from the other countries.
Most of the alf skins used in the
manufacture of shoes are imported
from France, Germany and Russia.
These countries have ceased exporting
hides. Our export of shoes, however,
has increased enormously.
"In addition to the shortage of hides
the cost of tanning has Increased since
the war began from 200 to 1,000 per
tent, owing principally to the scarcity
of chemicals and coloring stuffs. This
condition, with the added increase in
laces, thread, eyelets, buttons and
tacks, has Increased the cost of pro
duction."
