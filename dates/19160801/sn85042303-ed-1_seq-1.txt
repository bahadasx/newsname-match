All New York City may have to walk in a tVw days if the plans of the organizers of r.trect car workers are sin rest

COL. MILLS OF LOCAL INDIAN
AGENT'S OFFICE REPORTS
THEY ARE CHANGING FROM
OLD ORDER OF THINGS.
Col. Mills, in charge of the local
Indian agents ottice nere, where the
per capita payment is being made,
reports that the Indians as a rule are
putting their money in the bank and
hoarding it against the proverbial
rainy day. This speaks well for the
aborigine who in times past was
prone to spend his money where t ho
liquid fire flowed and usually awoke
with a bad headache and a depleted
purse.
The bankers of the city testify to
the fact that the Indians in this lo-
cality have been putting their money
on deposit during this payment in-
stead of into the hands of the boot-
legger, and as fast as Colonel Mills
passes out the checks he advises them
to make a deposit in some of the
lrcal banks.
