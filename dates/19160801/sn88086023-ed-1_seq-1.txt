Attacks Wilson Administration,
Mr. Hushes attacked the present
administration for its record in lor
elgn relations.
At the very beginning of the pres
ent administration.' he said, "where

had weakness and Inexpertnese. In
stead of assuring respect, wo Invited

difficulties which otherwise easily
could have been escaped."
He accused the president of having
removed capable foreign representa
tives In order to satisfy "deserving
democrats," referring particularly to
the Snnto Domingo affair and the re
moval of Ambassador Herrlck from
rraane.

HUGHES POUCY IS FIRMNESS
BUT FORM IS INDEFINITE;
MEXICO 1 PRINCIPAL ISSUE
NEW YORK, Aug. 1. Hughes' keynote speech ap
parently pleased all the republicans. It convinced both
republicans and democrats that Hughes' principal issue
will be Wilson's Mexican policy. It also plans to attack
inadequate preparedness and the tariff. New York
newspaper comment was as follows:
Tribune "One clear note ran through all Hughes'
speech. It was a challenge of incapacity and an indict
ment of failure. It is rightly an indictment of Wilson's
scattering point of view."
Times "Little new matter appears in the speech. It
w ill be remembered he wishes to make the Mexican ques
tion the burning issue, so hyphenated citizens may show
patriotism."
World "Hughes' acceptance is a public confession of
a candidate without an issue and without a policy. His
polity is of firmness. But what form does the firmness
take? War or intervention?"
Sacramento Union "It is a poor convention speech
handling grave problems along narrow partisan lines.
Hughes' weak, wobbling words will lose thousands of
friends."
Sacramento Star "Hughes' address is the weakest po
litical declaration in years. The real progressive element
Is disgusted by his palaver."

ALLIES SURE 10
WIN IN CONFLICT
LONDON, Aug. 1 Lord Newton,
under secretary of state for foreign
affairs, told the United Press the war
would not end a draw. He believes
the allies will surely win. He said:
"Entering the wart third year one
is convinced by contemporary' events
that our men's sacrifices and the
French sacrifices will quite assuredly
win their regard. The reward will be
punishment of the blood guilty, new
hope for the victims of the central
powers, new hope for Belgium, Ser
bia. Armenia and Syria. But the sac
rifice will be in vain unless new world
; conditions appear wherein action be
tween state and state Is conducted
in an atmosphere of better understand
j ing. If mutual andntaadlng fails, let
j the points at issue be decided under
the principles of Justice."
