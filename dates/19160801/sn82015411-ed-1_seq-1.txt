LANDS IN PRISON
Pedro Ruda, n Filipino of Lihue,
wrote n letter to a woman at Wai
niea threatening that if she did not
return to Lihuc by last Wednesday
he would do her serious bodily in
jury. The woman turned the let
ter over to the police. On Wednes
day Ruda appeared at Waimea and
was promptly taken into custody by
Deputy Sheriff W. 0. dwell.
When searched the man was found
to be armed with a butcher's knife
and a dagger, the latter being an
ugly weapon fashioned from a strip
of steel with a file.
In the court Ruda was found
guilty on two counts, the first being
a charge of carrying deadly weap
ons, for which he was sentenced to
imprisonment for six months, and
the second, threatening. I n the
latter case he was sentenced to file
a IkhhI forthwith in the sum of
$1,000 to keep the peace for one
year, in lieu of which be is to spend
the time in jail which he probably
will do.
The man and woman were friends
in Lihue and the trouble came as a
result of tlic visit of the latter to
Waimea against the will of the
former. Now that Romeo is in
jail, however, Juliette will probably
stay at Waimea as long as she
wishes.

1AWAIIANS HONOR
A very delightful surprise awaited
Hon. W. II. Rice last Friday when

very beautiful kou calabash with
arnate gold inscription plate, in

arrived here several days late, but
nevertheless the original program
was carried out in detail.
Several impressive Hawaiian songs
were sung, among which was one
especially dedicated to Mr. Rice, in
honor of the occasion. In the pre
sentation speech the long years of
untiring effort on the part of the
president of the Hawaiian Sunday
Schools were spoken of in the high

came from various parts of the
island to take cart in this event.

BELOVED FRIEND
Wednesday last, July 2(5, being
the birthday of Mrs. Win. Hyde
Rice, was the occasion of a very
pleasant testimonial of appreciation
on the part of the llui Aloha of
Kauai. This society was inaugu
rated, years ago, by Mrs. Rice for
the benefit of the Hawaiian women
and their homes, and, beginning
with Lihue, its usefulness has spread
to the various parts of the island.
On litis occasion delegates came
from the different parts of the island
to the number of some !(), and,
bearing flowers and a memorial of
greetings and good will, proceeded
in a body to the home of Mrs. Rice,
to deliver them in person, together
with individual felicitations and good
wishes. Most graceful among these
felicitations was a special hymn com
posed for the occasion by Mrs. II. L.
Sheldon, of Kapaa, and sung by
her with fine effect.
Mrs. Rice was naturally very
much touched by these evidences of
devotion and appreciation, and res
ponded in words of grateful feeling
and regard.
The happy event came to a close
in a festival of ice cream and cake
all round, and a general feeling of
joyous satisfaction.
The day was farther signalized by
many beautiful and valuable gifts
from a host of friends and relatives,
together with many messages and
cablegrams of felicitation and good
will.
