Dr. Charles P. Boldunn, head of the
Bureau of Public Health Education,
speaking for Commissioner Emerson,
said the Health Department was not
alarmed over the Increase In thn last
few days. Tho number of cases nnd
deaths on Tuesdays always Is large,
lie pointed out, because many physi
cians are In the habit of postponing
until Tuesday their reports for Sat
urday nnd Sunday.
Wo nro satisfied with the prevent
ive measures thnt are being taken
throuchout the city," he said. "We
also are satisfied with the treatment
bolng given in hospitals underthe
Jurisdiction ot the Health Deiiart-
ment."
What Is needed above all thlnrs,
added Dr. Boldunn, Is money with
which to buy braces and othor appli
ances for children recovering fro.n the
effects ot paralysis. Louts J. floro
wltx of tho Thompson-Htarrett Con

need to-day, contributing $5,000 for

Up to the present time 11,613 has
been turned over to the Health Do
partment by sympathetic Now York'
era, among them Mrs. Daniel CJuifgen-
belm, who has given $500.
"In connection with convalescent
children, an analysis of tho Infantile
paralysis situation Is Interesting,"
said Dr. Bolduan. "About 20 per cent
ot the victims die. Of tho 80 pur cunt.
who recovor 40 per cent, have some
form of paralysis. One-hulf of this
40 per cent, will need permanent sup
port for their limbs. This moans
that of 6,000 coses where recoveries

115,000 Is needed.

TO END SHELL PERIL
Explosives Declared a Public
Nuisance and All Must Be

POLICE TO BACK ORDER.
City Commission, for Public
Safety, Decides to Brush Aside
Law Technicalities.
The Hoard of City Commissioners of
Jersey City, after hearing a report of
a conference of city, Hudson County
and Federal officials on the menace to
safety ot the vast quantities of explo
slves being shipped Into Jersey City
for transshipment and storage, took
drastic action at a meeting this
afternoon.
Resolutions were offered by City
Commissioner Ilrenslnger. with the
taolt consent of .County Prosecutor
Hudspeth, declaring tho presence of
munitions In tho city a public nuis
ance, beyond tho reach of existing
Federal statutes, and therefore au
thorising Commissioner of rumio
Hatety Frank Hague to "use all avnll
able phyalcat forco at his command"
to bar all explosive nmmuhltlon from
the ctly limits. He was instructed to
notify all railroads and munition
shippers to remove their present hold
Ings from tho city limits within
twenty-four hours on pain or con-
s cation.
The resolution was passed by a
voto of four to one, commissioner
Henry Byrne being tho dissenter.
Mr. nyrno thought tho commission
ought to wait the result of an appeal
to Congress. Mr. llrnnsliiKer retorted
thnt he was himself a lawyer nnd Tie
would "be everlastingly damned" If
he would seo the technicalities of the
law used to expose his wife and chil
dren to the danger of being blasted
Into eternity.
Commissioner Hague wns emphat
ically In favor of the notion taken
end said bo would begin to act tho
minute the twenty-four hours wcro
up. The commission was advised
that the use of tho words "public
nuisance" In the resolution freed them
from eM liability for overriding ex
isting law.
Mayor Mark Pagan, addressing
Commissioner Hague said: "Neces
slty knows no law. There being no
law to protect us we have taken the
law In our hands. Commissioner
Hague we will give you all the police
you need to prevent more ammunition
from being brought Into thl city and
from being stored here. If we do not
give you enough police Bhorlff Kln
kald will be at your disposal with un
limited deputies."
"I shall not need them," said Mr,
Hague. "The explosives now here
will go out and no more will come In
Leave It to us."
Through the locked doors behind
which the earlier conference was held
ono ungry official was heard crying:
"If that Is the law, why then let us
go beyond tho law. I say to you, Mr.
Macr, and to all of you, that the
sentiment of tho community and Its
l-rntltude will bo behind us It we or
mnlze the pollen and go down thoro

source of destruction 'of property and
Io.m ot life Is being brought to our
water front. Hip 'em outl Tear 'em
out! Ilevlso the laws later but right
now make these great cities of ours
safe."
Tho speech wns applauded und
though other voices were raised
counselling moderation and coolness
