the Republicans are able to hold on
to the districts they now have and
take but eleven additional districts
froib tjie Democrats they will have
control of the House.
WEBSTER CITY AND FT.
DODGE CARS COLLIDE
-A
Younkee Family of Thia City anc
Fort Dodge Man in Automobile
"-Crash.,
An autotaoblle collision occurred
on a bridge about five miles east of
Fort Do)ge Friday evening at 10
o'clock when an Oakland car driven
by a gentleman by the name of Wil
son from Fort Dodge, going west
ran into the big Hudson car owned
by Charles Tounkee and his son,
George E. Younkee, withj the latter
at the wheel. The Younkee car was
just leaving the bridge and the Ft.
Dodge auto was just coming upon
the bridge from the opposite direc
tion. The dazzling auto lights made
it almost impossible to see the road.
The driver of the Fort Dodge car
was so blinded by the lights that he
swerved and ran into the Younkee
car.
The Younkee automobile was oc
cupied by Charles Younkee, Mr. and
Mrs. Geo. E. Younkee, Mrs. Jennie
Ainslie, and their guests, Mr. and
Mrs. E. D. Petrie of Salt Lake City.
They were returning from Ft. Dodge.
One front wheel on the Younkee ma
chine was badly broken and the other
one was damaged. The front axel
was bent and the fender rained. They
phoned in to the Parkhurst & Lav
ender garage and men were immed
lately sent out to bring the party
to town. However, it was found they
could return in the auto if they had
one new wheel, so Mr. Younkee and
Warren Bair, from the local garage,
drove to Fort Dodge and procured
one.
The elder Mr. Younkee returned
to town soon after the accident with
Mr. and Mrs. John R. Kamrar, who
happened along in their car. The
remainder of the party did not get
back until 1 o'clock this morning,
but were none the worse for their
experience. Nobody in either autO'
mobile party was thrown out or in
jured in any way, save one lady
with the Port Dodge party who sus
tained a slight injury to her nose.
The Oakland car driven by Mr.
Wilson was damaged beyond repair,
so Mr. Younkee thought. Mr. Wil
son is an employe of the Leighton
Bupply Company in Port Dodge and
besides this gentleman the car was
occupied by four other people. They
also phoned to a Fort Dodge garage
for aid and the car from that city
came out immediately to the scene
of the accident. They ran the dis
abled machine into a ditch at the
side of the road and returned to Ft.
Dodge in the garage car.
That nobody was seriously Injured
In such a mishap seems almost in
creditable, and all are Indeed lucky
that they escaped as they did.

Webster City Members of Moose
Lodge Attend Initiation and
Banquet.
About seventy-five members of the
Moose lodge of this city attended an
initiation and banquet Friday night
in Fort Dodge given by the Moose
lodge of that city, the local members
having received, an invitation to join
Vith them in the festivities. Nine or
ten new candidates wer^ taken into
fellowship with the order, a part of
them being from each of the two
places. The Webster City contin
gent went over in autos, filling about
fifteen cars. They made a parade
around town in the early evening
before leaving for the gypsum city
with banners and flags attached to
the cars. The banquet was served
after the initiatory degree was gone
through with, and the local mem
bers present report a very enjoyable
'time.
SHED WttSTLE OF
TDMSli IS HEARD
Oata of Hamilton County Will Run
About Forty-Five Bushels to
the Acre.
The sound of the siren, steam
thrasher is heard in the land again
and the noise falls upon the ear of
the farmer with several hundred
acres of oats as melodiously as a
strain of music.
Thrashing is barely begun near
Webster City and the result so far is
quite satisfactory to the farmer. The
yield is a little light as far as the
early thrashing indicates, and will
go about forty-five bushels to the
acre, which is about the same as in
1914. The hot aeason came on with
such severity and remained with
such steadfastness that the heads
did not mature as under ideal condi
tions. The straw is also sbort and
not of the heavy stand of former
years, but the general run of this
variety of small grain is satisfactory.
About eighty per cent, in the est!
mation of some grain men, will not
be as heavy as last year.
Last year there were little old oats
and this year the country is full of
them, but 34} cents is being paid for
both old and new oats.
It has been rumored that the pay
ing of the same price for old and
new oats is unprecedented, but such
not the case. Eight out of ten
years, the same price is paid for
September oats as is paid for Dec
ember grain. Oats have been 35
cents this season and will undoubt
edly reach that figure or more again
The oats market Is almost as variable
as the weather.
Family Camp Disperse!.
A camping party composed of
members of the Angus McLaughlin
family, old time residents of this
county, has for the past ten days
been heartily enjoying a sojourn in
the woods along Boone river in the
vicinity of Oak Glen church. This
family have made it a practice for the
past eight or ten years to gather here
from their various homes for a fam
ily reunion and an outing. All the
members of the family but one, re
turned to their homes on Saturday
morning having had a delightful
time in spite of the intense heat.
Those present were A. A. McLaugh

E. W. CHAFIN
PLEASES AUDIENCE
Candidate for President in 1908-12
Speaks Here on National
Prohibition.
The auditorium of the Methodist
church was about two-thirds filled
Sunday evening to hear the ad
dress by Hon. Eugene W. Chafin of
Tucson, Arizona. The fifth Sunday
in the month is always given over to
the W. C. T. U. on which to hold
union service with a temperance
speaker in the pulpit. Sunday night
was one of the hottest evenings of
the season and for this reason the
address was cut short, only lasting
about forty minutes.
Mr. Chafin is a pleasing speaker
and used as his subject "Prohibition
in 1916." He urged the use of me
diums—church, education and law
through why*h to disseminate a pro
hibition spirit. Through the ballot
alone however, he urged, will the
liquor traffic be finally eradicated
in America. The speaker cited his
hearers to the tremendous amount
of money spent upon liquor in the
United States and told what could be
done with that money if it might
have been used for missions.
The enormous expense of the Eur
opean war will be matched by the
billions of dollars which America
will be requested to give for missions
on the continent in the future.
Mr. Chafin is a persuasive speak
er and contrary to the methods so
frequently employed by prohibition
orators, made no reference to the
candidates for state offices from this
district or any other. No reference
whatever was made to the prohibi
tion party as a political element, but
the inference chiefly to be drawn
was that of the educational features
embodied in the party of which he
was a candidate for president in
1908 and 1912.
Ford Cars Still Lower.
The announcement was made Sat
urday that beginning August first,
the price of all Ford cars will be
reduced materially.
Roadsters that formerly sold for
$390 now cost $345. The touring
car priced last year at |440 sells
now at $369.
This means a drop of $45 for the
runabout and $80 for the touring
car. It means that every one can
have an automobile almost as cheap
as a perambulator. It may also mean
new crop of Ford jokes will soon
be on the market.
The new prices also affect the
chasis, which is now $325, the Ford
Coupelet at $505.00, the Ford Town
car, $595 and the Ford Sedan $645.
All these prices are quoted on board
cars Detroit.

THE WAY FELLER FEELS.
FRE

Guests Forced to Escape From Win'
dows—Nobody Injured, but
Many Were Terribly
Frightened.
BLAZE WAS IN THE BASEMENT
Damage by Smoke is Estimated at
From Fifteen Hundred to
Two Thousand Dollars.
The shriek of the flrewhistle
awakened Webster City people yes
terday a. m. about 3:30 o'clock, the
alarm having been turned in from
the Willson hotel corner. The blaze
was confined to one room, of the
Willson basement and the only pos
sible cause, aside from spontaneous
combustion, might have been the
burning off of insulation from elec
tric wires which dropped down
among several egg cases. Nothing
of value was stored in this room. The
hotel was soon filled with smoke and
frightened guests began pouring out
of the windows onto the fire escapes.
A few rushed down the stairs to
the first floor at the alarm of fire,
but in a few minutes the hallway
was so filled with smoke as to make
egress by that route impossible. Mr.
and Mrs. Harvey, proprietor and
wife, and their children and the day
clerk and wife, were unable to des
cend the stairs and were forced to
descend the fire escapes. They are
today badly used up from nervous
Bhock.
The north wind forced the smoke
through Into the annex from where
it poured into the street, giving the
impression of fire in every room of
the annex. Aside from the burning
of the woodwork in the basement
room, the damage Is confined to that
done by smoke. Every room in the
hotel is more or less damaged by
smoke and the first and second floors
are exceedingly smoked. These will
all have to be redecorated and the
furniture revarnlshed. The loss is
vaguely placed at from $1600 to
$2000.
There have been many fires in the
Willson hotel in Its history. Some
of these have been disastrous ones,
but the majority of tbem have had
the damage confined to that done by
water and smoke. The hotel Is not
closed ahd is fit to be used by the
traveling public, although the smell
of smoke will be rather strong for
some days.

GASOLINE THIEVES
OPERATING IN CITY
Wm. Blankenbuehler Loses Fifty
Gallon*—Other Losses Have
Been Reported,.
The price of gasoline is so high
that thieves are finding It profitable
to steal it. A few days ago Wm.
Blankenbuehler, residing on Walnut
street, had fifty gallons put into his
tank in the barn and that night
thieves stole the entire Bupply. It
has been reported that other lesser
quantities have been taken from pri
vate tanks in various parts of town
during the past few weeks. It ap
pears that some thieves are work
ing the -game for all there is in it.
It may be they have some place to
dispose of it at figures less than the
usual price. It is best for people
having gasoline In barns and gar
ages to keep it under lock and key.
Talented and Faithful Service.
Miss Rosalind Cook has been
granted a year's absence from her
duties as piano instructor in Ells
worth College, Iowa Falls, and in
the interium will study in Chicago.
This necessitates Miss Cook's resig
nation as organist at the Congrega
tional church, at least for a year, a
position she has filled for many
years with signal ability. In view
of this situation and before he be
gan his sermon Sunday morning,
Rev. Arthur Metcalf presented to
Miss Cook a purse of money contrib
uted as a token of appreciation by
Miss Cook's friends for her faithful
and ever-readiness to help upon any
and all occasions in which the
church or its auxiliary societies
might be interested. Rev. Metcalf
gave Miss Cook hearty thanks for
her efficient and unstinted service to
the church and wished her abundant
success in pursuing her musical
studies—sentiments which yrere
heartily endorsed by all in the con
gregation. Miss Rosalind Cook Is
not only a first class musician, but
is an exceptional young lady in many
other respects.
Miss Cook was greatly surprised
to receive this mark of appreciation
and feels very grateful for the gift,
not alone for Its intrinsic value, but
especially for the spirit which
prompted it.
Card of Thanks.
We wish in this manner to thank
the friends of the family for their
kindness during the illness and at
the time of the death of our hus
band and father. Also for the beau
tiful floral offerings and for the au
tomobiles furnished by the Masons
and other friends at the funeral ser
vices.

Member of the Town Council Ar
rested While Motoring in
Fort Dodge.
Fort Dodge, July 29.—W. H. Rick,
who says he is a councilman at Wil
liams, was arrested several days ago
for speeding. He put up a $5.00
bond and was to appear this morning
at 11:30. for a hearing. He didn't
show up today, however, and the
$5.00 bond automatically came into
the possession of the city.
"I don't believe in speeding" was
Rick's comment when arrested.
told the boys at Williams to be on
the lookout and arrest anyone trying
to break records. But to tell the
truth, I don't believe I'm guilty here,
You know this car can't go twenty
five miles an hour."
Rick, however, didn't have
speedometer on his car, so he
couldn't say how fast he was going.

AMONG TH£ SOLDIERS
State Secretary Parsons Asks for
125 From Webster City to
Assist in Movement.
The Freeman-Tribune is in receipt
of a letter from W. M. Parsons, state
secretary of the Y. M. C. A. of Iowa.
He wants the co-operation of Web
ster City and the Freeman-Tribune
believes he will get it. The com
munication, which Is self-explana
tory, Is as follows!
Des Moines, July 28,-?—Freeman
Tribune, Webster City Iowa.—The
state committee of the Y. M. C. A.
is erecting a building 40x100 feet in
the army camp at Brownsville,
Texas. Will you co-operate with us
by sending one or two copies of your
paper to the building?
In addition to this, would you not
be willing to co-operate with others
in your city in raising a special fund
for the army Y. M. C. A. work. Here
are the facts: The state committee
had a large tent at Camp Dodge and
employed two men in connection
Vrith it to promote a strong social
and religious work during the month
that the boys were in camp here. We
estimate that the cost of the Camp
Dodge work, the building at Browns
ville and its operation to December
1st, will require about $4,500. We
are 'asking each town having a com
pany in one of the regiments to raise
$125 for this special army work.
W, M. Parsons, Sec. Y. M. C. A.
If somebody here in Webster City
would take it upon himself or her
self to go ahead and organize a so
liciting campaign it is likely the
$125 could be raised without much
trouble. It Is certainly a worthy
work and the people of Hamilton
county will be ready to help if per
sonal solicitation is indulged in.

Yet They are Within Shooting Dis
tance of Nine Thousand
Carranza Troops.
Brownsville, Texas, July 31.—Just
a mile and a half from the tent of
Col. E. R. Bennett, the headquarters
of the Third Iowa infantry, are 9,
000 Carranza troops. They a.re gar
risoned in the city of Matamoras, di
'rectly across the river from Browns
ville.
If they should become suddenly
hostile they could bring up a few
pieces of artillery and drop some of
the shells our government sold them
into the Iowa camp.
It's rather uncanny to close your
eyes and go to sleep with the knowl
edge that an organized mob of grin
go-haters are encamped within
shooting distance of you.
It's rather unusual to bo in that
position without ammunition.
For the Iowa troops as yet have
no ammunition, other than 1,200
rounds they brought from home. And
that makes one shell for each man.
ROLAND DRIVER
RUNS INTOJORD CAR
Car Driven by Leslie Clifton Struck
by Big Eight Cylinder
Cadillac.
An automobile collision occurred
Sunday night about 9 o'clock on
west Second street between the Ford
car belonging to and driven by Lea
lie Clifton, and a big eight cylinder
Cadillac owned and driven by Olaf
Amonson of Roland who, with his
daughter, was just coming into thia
city from Lake Okoboji for a short
visit with the Peter Mathre family.
The car driven by Mr. Clifton had
just stopped in front of the Clifton
residence in the 1300 block to allow
Mrs. Clifton to alight two young
men friends of Mr. Clifton were in
the back seat and the car was on the
right side of the street facing east,
when it was suddenly struck by the
Cadillac which was driving east also.
The Clifton car was driven by the
impact upon the curbing, about flfty
feet from where It had been stand
ing, and the rear axle was bent, be
side several other damages to the
machine. None of the occupants of
either car was Injured, more than
a severe shaking up.
The Cadillac was badly damaged
and is in the garage today. The
driver stated that he saw the Ford
car farther back on the road, but
supposed it was going on east and
at the moment his machine struck it,
he was looking the other way. The
back of the front seat In the Ford
car was also broken by thd force of
the impact and the occupants of both
cars are indeed lucky to have escap
ed serious injury.
