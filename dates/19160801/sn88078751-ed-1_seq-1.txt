icore Are
New York, July 31. Four or more
lives were los and property damage
estimated at f?25,000,000 was caused
by a" onrjes of torrlllo explosions of
ammunition 'awaiting shipment to the
entente allies and stored on Black
TonuJsland, a small atrip of land jut
ting into Now York bay. oft! Jersey
City. Scores of persons were injured,
Eoveral probably fatally.
The detonations, which were felt in
flvo states, began wtta a continuous
rapid fire of small shells, then the
blowing up of great quantities of dy
namlte, trinltrotolun and other high
explosives, followed by the bursting
of thousands of shrapnel shells which
literally- sho"wered tho surrounding
country and waters for many miles
around.
Fire that started soon after tho first
great crash, which spread death and
desolation in Us wake, destroyed thir
teen of tho huge warehouses of the
National Storage company on Black
Tom Island, In which were stored mei
chandiso valued at between $12,000,
000 and $15,000,000.
Tho names shooting into tho clouds
were reflectod against Now York's
skyline of towering office buildings
which only a few moments before
were shaken in their foundations as
by an earthquake. Miles of streets in
Manhattan alone were strewn with
broken glass and shattered signs.
Cause of the Disaster.
Tho cause of the disaster has not
been determined. Officials of the Na
tional Storage company and the Le
high Valley railway, which also suffer
ed heavily through the loss of prop
erty, declared, however, that reports
to them showed a fire started at an
early hour on a barge belonging to an
Independent towing company that had
been moored alongside a dock used by
the railroad company to transfer am
munition shipments from trains to
vessels in the harbor.
Tho barge, It was said, was there
without authority either of tho rail
road or the storage company. The of
ficials refused to disclose tho name
of the Independent towing company,
saying they were investigating "to as
certain whether tho barge purposely
had been set on fire as the result of
n plot."
Edmund L. Mackenzie, president of
the National Storage company de
clared that tho plant of his concern
was valued at $7,000,000, while the
contents of thp warehouses probablv
were worth $10,000,000. One of thft
warehouses which remains intact, he
said, is filled with chemicals. Beslne

his company and the' railroad,, Mr.
Mackenzie said", waspartly covered
by insurance. '
Most of the 'Injured taken to city
hcsoitals were struck by shrapnel,
falling glass or debris. Nearly all
were in the railroad yards or on craft
moored near the island.,;' Included
among them are a few women and
children whoso homeswere on barges.
Every window in the pedestal of the
Statue of Liberty on Bedloe'S' island,
opposite Black Tom, was broken and
the main door, made of iron and
weighing almost a ton, was blown ofl
its hinges.
According to Captain A, n. Fry, su
pervising engineer of federal build
incs In New-York, the loss to Ellis
Is'and buildings will not exceed $30,
000. Many small craft, as well as sev
eral Rood-sizPd steamers and sailing
vessels were badlv damaged. Crews

In the harbor or ilcDkcd along the New
Jersey and Now York water fronts de

explosions occurred It appeared as if
their vessels were literally picked up
out of tho water and then hurled bac.
C. V. Levden, chief of the Lehigh
Valley railroad police, was killea
while aiding an engine crew in at
tempting to save a number of freight
cars from tho fire. A quantity of dy
namite exploded near where he was
standing, It was said, and blew his
body to atoms. The members of the
car crew escaped with lacerations and
burns.
