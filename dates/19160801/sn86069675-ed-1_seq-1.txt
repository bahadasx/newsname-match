dSJHKns, died nt his homo in this
eigjFriday evening after a linger
ing fillness of stomach trouble and
.rheumatism. While bis dcat,h was
expected it came nevertheless as a
shock to bis many friends and
relatives .
Q Deceased was. never mamed and

4ame2Hi.-T.Vi!son, both- f-thr wun.
ty, besides many pthex relatives, wlio
have -the; sympathy of the entire i
community in their sorrow.
Mr. Ragan was a member of the
Baptist church and many months
ago whe-n, plans were Being ormu
iated ioT. the, erection Of tt new
house of worship ho sent for the
pastor and one of the deacons and
ayig he wnnted to do bis part in
that good work, gave them a check
for .$1,0P0. This was the first con.
trilmtion made toward the building
and h sad Venture of his death Is
that, he, the first to mnKe a contri
button toward erecting the benuti
ful church, yas the first one to. be
Imried frprn it.
At all times, undqr all circum
stances, he walked in the well ben.
en path of righteousness and when
fully consqious that ho was Hear
ing the last of earth, ho appeared
tyj be fully impressed with 'the idea
that at the end-of time eternity
began, and that the. bright faith
which sustained him during" those
trying hours of suffering would only
grow brighter as he journeyed to
ward the infinite, nnd the final
'gloom of death be dispelled by the
radiance of God's love. Could n5
livo the just and upright life ho liv
edt and die in His trusting faith,
leath could no longer be called
"The King of Terrors" for he in
spired no terror there. The dying
man and sorrowing family looked
forward with the same eye of faith
to the brighter future where this
temporary separation would end in
an eternal reunion.
