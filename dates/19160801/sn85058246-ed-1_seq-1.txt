PROHIBITION
f SERMONS AT
TABERNACLE
Senator Funk and Attorney Law Each
Make Strong Appaata For State
Wide Dry Laws
Attorney A. A. Law's 'lack porch"
talk at the Tabernacle on Sunday af
ternoon on the subject of Prohibition
was a most convincing appeal, In fact
it was one ot the most practical pro
hibition sermons ever delivered from
a local platform.
M The speakers at the afternoon ser-
vices were Sonutor J. W. Punk ot
Richmond and Attorney Law, Each
acquitted himself well on the sub-
Jcct. Senator Punk gave his reasons
W for becoming a prohibitionist. He had
fi been converted through his expert
B ences. Ho had observed conditions
B under laws licensing the open saloon
H and he had observed condition with
B the saloon abolished. The moral ef
fl feet and the business effect under the
fl different conditions wero so marked
ttB that any thinking man will be found
jfl an the side ot prohibition.
fl Senator Funkysays the trips to Og-
fl dpn and Salt Lakojby nutomobllo nnd
fl ,-loctrlc rail nre' fa too frequent to
M bo tolerated by a" community which
fl wishes a dry town. Therefore he urg-
cfl cd that we do our utmost for the
fl cause of prohibition.
Hfl Attorney Law who followed the dts-
Jfl tlngulshed senator, said he lind no
fl r.et speech but would conilne himself
fl Kito a "back porch" talk and give some
fl of his observations. It was n moBt ef-
fl fectlvo appeal for the cause ho has
X espoused. He said a prohibition pol-
fl ley Is one that tends to upbuild the
ifl human race, morally and Intellectual-
gfl ly. There Is no act time to do good,
ifl ue contended, but It should be tho du-
(fl ty ot every one to exert an Influenco j
XWm for good at all times. "If we are to
tro--1)a no1'1 nccountau,e for tJ' tuln5s I
m wo do hero In the hereafter, we will
bo held accountable for the Influence
wo set along life's pathway from day
m to day, whether U bo for good or 111."
Attorney Law referred to conditions
B In Logan somo few years back when
B wo first tried to put prohibition laws
fl Into olfect In this city. He called at
fl tcntlon to the well known fact that
fl when our officers first tried to en
fl forco tho prohibition laws, the often
9 der of the law had numerous friends
fl who wero willing to take up his cause
fl and at onco the officer would become
tho most despised man In tho wholo
community. These cpndltlons havo
fl completely changed, he said. Now the
fl bootlegger Is considered a menace to
fl society and he finds but little sympa
fl thy when ho Is caught trying to
fl lrak the lews governing the sale of
B Intoxicating liquors.
fl Referring to the recent conversions
fl to the cause of prohibition, Attorney
B Law said wo snould look" (nto the
fl causes for these conversions. Ot
fl course, these remarks wore taken to
fl refer to tho men who are running
tor Mate offlco and who havo past re-
cords on this question which are well
known to tho people ot tho state.
I AT THE LYRIC
fl p
fl liorn In Pig Tall Alloy, little Sally
fl soon grew to be of bettor clay than
fl tho remainder of tho children In the
B alloy. She had to work to support
fl her parents, but with lofty ideals, pre-
fl pared herself for a day when she
fl would be recognized In tho world,
fl And tho day did come.
fl Do not fall to sea how Sally von

THE MAKING
OF MADDALENA
In tho story of, Tho Muking nt Mad
dnlcna, the Morosco Paramount pho
toplay coming to tho Lyric theater on
Wednesday and Thursday, George
Halo Is Influenced to start an art ca
reer In Rome. He docs this to win
tho admiration of tho girl ho loves.
Being of a caretrco, happy disposi
tion he dallies with bis work. Yet ho
feels wronged when he receives her
letter confessing her love for and
acceptance of another.
That power which always finds
somo mischief for an Idler to do
starts the trouble George Halo's now
reckless fancy attracts and awakejis
the emotions of tho beautiful Italian
model.
Miss Goodrich as Aiaauaionn, me
model, portrays the part with won
derful comprehension. She nets this
not as an actress possessing great
emotional powors, but as would net
a humblo born Italian girl of ready
sympathies and ambitious derlres.
Tho evident fascination ot doing
thnt which ought not to he done lends
Georgo Halo Into an indiicreet marriage-
This marrlago works a great
and almost fatal havoc In many llvo-J.
This Is well told by the acting of
tho strong cast Including besides Ed
na Goodrich, Forest Stanley, Juan de
la Cruz, Howard Divles, John Burton,
Mary Mersch and Colin Chase.

ling of heels has produced.
TIio Lynch Construction Company
ot Salt Lake City has the contract
for putting down tho concrete foot
ings nnd tho building of now convoy
ors. These new conveyors are a
urcnt convenience to tho fnrmcrs who
haul their beets direct to tho factory.
Tho unloading process Is very idmplo

TWO YEARS AGO
TODAY SINCE THE
"WARJTARTED
It Is two years today since tho be
ginning of tho European war, and yet
the prospects of ncaco seem far re
moved. From this distance It Is im
possible to say. whothertho object of
either of the warring tactions has In
uny measure boen obtained. Bo that
object what it may havo attained or
urattalned, one can only feel that tho
cost has far outweighed tho advan
tage Tills burden of debt and misery
will be borne by the unborn genera
tions of tho world for scores of year3
to come. The cost in dollars and
cents has reached a sum far beyond
the comprehension of most of us and
the cost in human lives, misery and
suffering Is a shock to tho senslblll
ties tu contemplate.
Tho fortunes ot both belligerents
havo bbed and (lowed throughout
theso two years. At present tho tklo
of battlo seems to be nt obb time for
the entente allies. There has been
waging for the past five months tho
most titanic struggle In the history
of the world, the battle of Verdun,
and It appears attor this prolonged
struggle that It all will end only with
tho complete exhaustion of ono or the
other ot the warring groups. The only
results visible nt this distance Is tho
measured depletion of their resourc
es for continuing tho conflict, because
ono can only conclude that otter two
ears of carnage like that witnessed
at Verdun the end must be near, as
it Is a physical Impossibility for any
powor or powers to long stand the
slaughter of millions of men and tho
expenditure ot billions of money.
