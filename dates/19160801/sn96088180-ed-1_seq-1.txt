TO
San Francisco, Aug. 1. Prepared
to submit the letter filet kept by
Thomas J. Mooney, one of the sus
pects in the suit' oase dynamiting
caae, District Attorney Flckert will
go before the grand Jury tonight and
ask the Indictment of Mooney, his
wife, Warren Killings, Edward Nolan
and Israel Weinberg on charges of
murder.
Thla announcement waa made by
the district attorney today after a
careful examination of the letter
taken in a visit by the police to the
home of Mooney's sister. According
to Flckert and Captain Matheaon, of
the bomb squad, the letters reveal the
plana of the alleged plot.
One letter la said to have Indicated
that some man In the east, whose
name detectives will not reveal, had
given Mooney certain sums of money,
evidently to further bis plans. An
other la declared to have been ad
dressed to two men, former associates
of Mooney, asking them If they would
be "foot loose for a couple of
weekaT" Newspaper cuttings refer
ring to the recent Martinet and Car
olines dynamiting! were Included in
.the evidence.
I Flckert said that In one letter
Mooney aald hla vlewa were "becora
I Ing more radical," while In a letter
to Billings he urged the latter "above
all things, keep your mouth shut."
I The most Important additional de
velopment during the past 24 hours
was the positive ldentl float Ion of
Israel Welnburg'a Jitney bus' as the
machine which stood in front of 721
Market street, while Billings, Mooney
and Mrs. Mooney were there ehortly
before the explosion which cost nine
lives.
j , The dlstrlot attorney says he also
has located a Jeweler In Oakland who
I declares he sold to Billings four
alarm docks like the one found In
an unexploded bomb picked up tn
San Mateo county recently.

day on her return voyage to Ger

from the hundreds of motor boats,
tugs and other craft in the harbor.
Her escort consisted of the launch
Efco, the government tug Wlssa-
hlckon and the police boat Lannan.
Baltimore, Aug. 1. Germany's
first submarine freighter, the
Deutschland, left her Patapsco river
berth this afternoon en route home.
Flanked by vessels to guide her,
she turned her nose toward the Vir
ginia capes, where' she may await
further before dashing to sea.
The channel for a hundred yards
or more had been dragged lest the
submarine come to grief from hidden
mines. The managers apparently
feared that some of the passing allied

board, but the search showed
'nothing. ' , (
During the forenoon harbor' tugs,'
'revenue and pojlce boats had swarm

were to watch for any vessels that
I might "accidentally" ram her.

New York, Aug. 1. Charles Evans
Hughes' "keynote" for the coming
campaign pleased all republicans to
day. Party chiefs who assembled to
hear the former Justice- formally ac
cept tho nomination last night were
unanimous today In praising the
striking sentences with which the can
didate outlined the IssueB on which
the O. O. P. Is to start eviction pro
ceedings against Woodrow Wilson
and the democratic majority In the
senate and house.
The fact that 4,000 men and wo
men eat for nearly three hours In
sweltering, slszllng heat to hear the
nominee 'break another one of his
famous silences in the meeting at
Carnegie hall was looked upon by
I republicans today as auguring well
for success In November. Moreover,
the same sticky, sweating auditors
had enough enthusiasm left at the
end of that session In the close air
of the hall to cheer Hughes vocifer
ously. They would have liked to have
heard something from Roosevelt, but
the former moose, playing "second
fiddle" t a political gathering for the
first time tn a great many years,
hustled out of the hall.
'Hughes' speech pleased today be
cause, tn the view of his friends, he
supported his harmony plea with a
selection of the issues for the cam
paign which combine vlewa of re
publican standpatters, republican lib
erals and progressives.
The "old liners" were pleased with
a ringing protection declaration on
the tariff; the liberals with the labor,
conservation and Administration's ef
ficiency sections In his upbraiding of
the Wilson administration, and the
bull moosers with the "Americanism"
.creed,. tho preparedness platform and
the Mexican dlscusslqn.
Republicans and democrats alike
today were convinced that Hughes'
prtnolpnl Issue In his fight against
DEUM
Dock at Baltimore Late
took positions on either aide of the
Deutschland and arrangements were
made to give the boat a safe de
parture from American waters.
The tug Tlmmons, which has been
the guardian angel or tho Deutsch

maintained a screen lor the sub

man, the pilot who brought the sub
marine freighter Deutschland safely
Into port, will take her out again.
Plana of the promoters call for him
to pilot her down the bay before
night. This was learned authorita
tively early today, and It was under
stood that Coleman was then at the
dock where the Deutschland and the
tug Tlmmons He. ,

cerning the pilot became known, the
tug .T4mmons and the smaller launch

carrying a drag, apparently to pick

The second line offensive will be
the 'bombardment along the lines of
"adequate" preparedness and the
tariff.
Nearly eight years ago Hughes ac
cepted the gubernatorial nomination
In Madison Square garden. At that
time and tn the campaign which fol
lowed, he was adjudged one of the
best campaigners New York had ever
seen. Considerably grayer of beard
and more bald last night than on that
other night of acceptance, Hughes ex
hibited no diminution of vigor In hla
stumping ability, in the opinion of
those who knew him In other days.
On his transcontinental trip, start
ing Saturday, his supporters expect
him to give the country a sample of
the sort of campaigning that made
him famous tn the gubernatorial raoe.
Following is a. symposium of edi
torial comment on the acceptance
speech of Justice Hughes In New York
last night: .
New York Tribune One clear
note runs through the whole of Mr.
Hughes' speech. It is a challenge of
lnoapaotty, an indictment of failure.
It is rightly an Indictment of Wilson's
scattering point of view. 'But it woul
be Idle to pretend that portion of the
address which deals with the Lusl-
faille, massacre is satisfactory to the
Tribune.
New York Times 'Little that Is
new appears In the speech. It will be
remembered he wishes to make the
Mexican question the burning Issue so
that citizens accused of hyphenlsatton
'may have an opportunity to show
their patriotism.
New York World Mr. Hughes'
speech) of. acceptance la public Con
fesBlon of a candidate who is without
an Issue and without a policy, His
policy Is to be one of firmness. But
what form is firmness going to takef
War? Intervention?

Washington, Aug. 1. Germany has
refused to agree to England's terms
tor Polish relief. The answer to Eng
land and to the circular note' of the
state 4partmant qt July ,7, erea-
ing tne nope for a Polish agreement,
was cabled from Berlin by Ambassa
dor Gerard and given out by the state
department today. ,
Germany places the blame for the
food scarcity In Poland on the Rus
sian army, which Germany claims de
stroyed or confiscated all the food
stuffs in Its retreat
The note eaid the Germanovern
ment had offered all the guarantees
regarding Polish relief which were
consistent with the requirements of
war and that It Is England's fault
that the American relief waa required
several months ago, as it was in
northern France.
j As October 1 was the date set for
jthe end of any relief agreement
made, the note said further negotia
tions are devoid of purpose. How
ever. Germany claims that the com
ing harvest, due to extensive culti
vation, will furnish enough food for
the civil population of Poland and
tmthanla, although some hardship
win be felt until the harvest
CANADIAN FIRE
TAKES HEAVY TOLL
Halleybury, Ontario, Aug. 1. As
scores of dead in the Are-swept dis
trict between Ramore and Cochrane
were burled in deep trenches today
there was every indication that the
toll of life taken by the devastating
forest lire never will be known. It
Is believed that more than 500 were
lost in the forest fire which swept
hundreds of square miles in northern
Ontario. .
Identification waa Impossible as the
flames ate up every Identifying mark.
Refugees who escaped have been un
able to tell how their neighbors fared.
The survivors found were' pitifully
few. The first train bringing sur
vivors carried but forty-seven, of
whom three women and 17 men were
horribly burned.' v
Whole settlements were wiped out
Relief workers sent back reports of
eight survivors In a village of S08, of
57 bodies ind In a single railway
out, 16 f.ad In a pit, 24 found tn
one house and of 130 bodies burled
In the course of a single morning. For
every' "body found along the railway
a dozen may be seen lying dead under
the ashes of northern Ontario; was
the word sent hack by the rescuers.

ZEPPELINS RAID
ENGLISH COAST
London, Aug. 1. Probably' one of
the Zeppelins engaged in the raid on.
the eastern counties was bagged, the-
war office thought today. ' The raider
was engaged by British aircraft and
bombarded by anti-aircraft guns.
Later It was seen to drop-to a low
altitude and disappear In the mist off
shore. '
The number of dirigibles engaged
In the raid was not announced. A
number of explosive bombs were drop
ped in a score or more places and
the Zeppelins apparently cruised over
halt a dozen or more counties, drop
ping bombs at several places of no
military Importance. . ' , '
The Zeppelins flew at a great
height, and It was extremely difficult
to determine their exact number, the
war office said, but there were at least
six. The bombs which they dropped
'fell in thinly Inhabited districts;
