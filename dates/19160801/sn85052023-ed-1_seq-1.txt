SWALLOWS NICKEL AND DIES.
(From Falmouth Outlook.)
Mr. and Mrs. Elmer E. Fossett took
their ."bright and pretty little 18-months-old
daughter, Lola May, to
Cincinnati Tuesday morning to be ex
amined with the X-Ray. The child
swallowed a nickel on Thursday of
last week and it lodged at the en
trance of the stomach. The child
could not swallow anything but liq
uid food. It seems that the nickel
lodged edgewise, and not entirely
closed the entrance to the stomach.
The X-Ray was used to locate the
nickle. The surgeon tried to extract
the nickel from the baby's throat by
probing for it. The attempt was too
severe and proved fruitless. Pneu
monia developed and death followed
in a short time.
BABY FOUND DYING.
A two-months old daughter of Mr.
and Mrs. Hubert Manning, who lives
on the Higgins place, not far from
Crab Orchard, was found in a dying
condition when the family arose this
morning. The little thing died with
in an hour. It is not known what
caused the child's death, but the
body broke out with something like
the hives just as the little light went
out. . ..,, -ii
HEAD SPLIT OPEN
WITH CORN KNIFE
Renzo King Pobaify Fatally Wound
ed by Jim Baker Near Moreland
Sunday Morning.
Citizens of the West End of Lin
coln are considerably aroused over
the wounding of Renzo King a prom
inent resident of the Moreland sec
tion by James Baker, a thresher
hand Sunday morning. Mr. King
lies at the point of death with a
wound in his skull eight inches long,
made by a corn knife.
Baker, his brother, Wm. Baker,
and Levi Kelly, who were with Mr.
King at the time of the unfortunate
affair, were arrested and the man
charged with the crime was brought
before Judge Bailey for examining
trial Tuesday morning. On account
of the serious condition of Mr. King,
the Commonwealth, which was rep
resented by Attorney K. S. Alcorn
in the absence of County Attorney
W. S. Burch, announced that it was
not ready, so Judge Bailey fixed the
trial for next Friday morning.
Jim Baker when taken to the jail
afterward and asked by an I. J. rep
resentative if he cared to make a
statement for publication, said in
substance this:
"I had been working on a thresher
all week, and Sunday morning had
gone to the depot to get some
'tricks' (grub, he explained). When
I went over to where they were
(meaning Mr. King, his brother Wm.
Baker and Levi Kelly) King caught
me around the waist and began jab
bing his fingers into me. I pulled
myself loose from him and asked
him to stop. But he grabbed me
gain and again and punched me in
the side and body with his fingers.
That's all there was to it." Mr. Ba
ker said that this was what lead up
to the trouble with Mr. King.
After the cutting which took place
near Mr. King's orchard, Wm. Baker
and Kelly went for a doctor. The
trio had endeavored to carry King to
town but could not do so, "and then
sent for a physician. No effort was
made by any of the men to run
away, and when Sheriff J. G. Wea
therford went for Baker, he gave
himself up. Kelly and Wm. Baker
were held as witnesses, and Wm. Ba
ker was released by Judge Bailev
under $250 bond as a witness. It
was given by his mother. Kelly was
also released on bond.
Mr. King has been unconscious
'post of the time shu-a the affair, but
aon after physicians got to him, he
-oused, and told Wm. Burkitt. so
Deputy Sheriff John ?Iossr renarfcetW
.iere luesday, that one of the Bakers
had held him while the other one cut
him. Since then, it is understood
:hat he has been unconscious and
unable to talk.
In an effort to save his life an op
aration was performed on his head
Monday by Drs. J. R. Cowan, of
Danville, W. J. Childress, of Hus
tonville and M. L. Pipes, of More
.and. It was found that the wound
received from the heavy corn knife
had penetrated into the brain at sev
eral points and very little hope for
his recovery is held out by the phy
sicians. Mr. King has been living at More
land a number of years and bears a
splendid reputation, and is well es
teemed by all who know him. He
'ame there from Casey county and
;s a brother-in-law of Sheriff J. D.
Taylor, of Casey, who was present
iere Tuesday morning when Baker
.vas brought before Judge Bailey.
3aker's bond was fixed by Judge
Bailey at $1,000.
LIGHTNING IN ADAIR
In Adair county last week I. R.
Henson was in the barn of his father,

vas knocked down and senseless.
When found he did not know how
long that he bad been unconscious,
jut stated that he felt he had just
aeen awakened from sleep. He was
not injured and no damage was done
-o the barn save the splitting of the
post.

ette Circuit Court this morning au

bert to collect unpUid stock sub
