Hugh's t, might ouillncil In Ms speech
of acceptance the Issues upon which
he will conduct I.ik campaign for ttia
presidency,
Mrs. Hughes assailed t he administra
tion for the course it has pursued with
reference lo Mexico, miiintalnance of
American rights during ihe Kuropean
war, preparedness ami other ureat
questions of the dav. He declared for
a new policy of "firmness nnil con
sistency" toward Mexico, for "the un
flinching inainiainance of all Ameri
can rights on land and sea," and for
adequate national defense, udeqiiativ
protection on both our western uml
eastern coasts."
"We denounce all plots and con
spiracies m the inieiest of ny for-
leign nation," Mr. HiiKhen said. "Ut
I lerly Intolerable Is the use of our doll
I for nheit Intrigues. Fvcry American
jmiisl unreservedly condemn them anil
' support every effort lor their mip-
pression.
The nominee assailed the adminis
tration for its "direction of diplomatic
, Intercourse," from the beginning, de
daring that where there should have
i been conspicuous strength and experl
j n -i-s ihele had been weakness anil In
jexpei luess. In cited Santo Doinlnmi

iiigly bel rayeil by iippointmenti

I "I endorse Ihe declaration in lux
j platform in favor of woman miffraBi1,"
i Mr. Hughes declared. And ho ntliletl:
"i ippusltloii may delay, but in my
I Indium-lit eaitimt defeat this move
I mi nt. I favor the vote for women."

the tie facto government by the iilntn
'department June L'ti, last, part of
which was quoted ill the speech. The
sei.iire uf Vera Cruz, the noiiiinen
said, "was war, of course."
"Later we retired from Vera Cruz,"
he continued, 'giving up this nohln
win fare. Hivciilly Ihe naked li iilh
I was admitted by a cabinet officer. Wu
'are not informed that we did nol go
llo Vera Cruz to force Muerta to saluie
it ho flag. We are told that we went
'there to 'show Mexico lhat We were
lln i a in .1 In our demand that lliicil.i
I must to.' "
i America, Mr Hughes continued,
I "has no policy of aggression toward
I.Mexico, no desire for any pari of her
j territory, but w ished her lo luivo
peace, stability and prosperity.
! Iiilferciiccs In Surmount.
"The conduct of Ihe adnilnist rat Ion
has created diffei cuces we shall have
lo surmount," he said. "We ilemii'ut
I'l,, ui Mi Men Ihe protection of (ho
lives and prosperity of our citizen
j.-iiid Ihe security of our border from
i 1
depredations."
Safeguarding American rights
aluoail had not been accomplished by
Hie administration, he said. There
had been "brave words In a series of
notes,'' but "what does It avail to use
some of Hie slrongcst words known I
diplomacy If ambassadors can receivu
Ihe impression (hat the words are nol
to In: liken seriously'."'
The nominee reili rated his declar
ation that had Ibis gov eminent left
ho doubt lhal il meant to hold Her
ilianv to "slrici aei oniilalulity" there
would have been no loss of life on I In-
I l.usilama.
