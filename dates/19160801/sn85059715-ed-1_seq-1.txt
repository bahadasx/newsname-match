In a Great American Speech
Accepting the Nomination
for the Presidency.
NEW YOIIK, Auk. 1.?Charles E.
Hughes last night outlined In his
speech of acceptance the issues upon
which he will conduct his campaign
for the presidency.
Mr. Hughes assailed the administration
for the course It has pursued
with reference to Mexico, maintenance
of American rights during the
European war, preparedness and other
great questions of the day. He declared
for a new policy of "firmness
and consistency toward Mexico," for
"the unfiinching maintenance of all
American rights on land and sea/'
and for "adequate national defense;
adequate protection on both our
western and eastern coasts."
"We denounce all plots and conspiracles
in the interest of any foreign
nation." Mr. Hughes said. "Utterly
Intolerable Is the use of our soil for
alien intrigues. Every American
must unreservedly condemn them and
support every effort for their suppression."
The nominee assailed the administration
for its "direction of diplomatic
intencourie" from the beginning.
declaring that where there
should have been conspicuous
strength and expertness there had
been weakness and inexpertness. He
cited San Domingo as an Instance
where appointments had gone to "deserving
Democrats," and to the failure
to continue Ambassador Herriek
at his post in I'aris after the war had
started as "a lamentable sacrifice of
International repute."
"f endorse the declaration in the
platform in favor of woman suffrage,"
Mr. Hughes declared. And he
added: "Opposition may delay, but In
my Judgment cannot defeat this
movement. I favor the vote for women."
Days Stress on Mexican .Muddle.
One-fourtb of the speech was do
voted to Meiico. Step by step taken
by the administration with reference
to Meiico was assailed, from the days
of Huerta to the note sent to the de
facto government by the state department
June 20 last, part of which
was quoted in the speech. The seizure
of Vera Cruz, the nominee said,
"was war, of course."
"Later we retired from Vera Cruz,"
he continued, "giving up this noDie
warfare. Recently the naked truth
was admitted by a cabinet ollicer. We
are now informed that we did not go
to Vera Cruz to force Huerta to salute
the flag. We are told that we went
there to 'show Mexico that we were
In earnest In our demand that Huerta
must go.' "
America, Mr. Hughes continued,
had no policy of aggression toward
Mexico, no desire for any part of her
territory, but wished her to have
peace, stability and prosperity.
"The conduct of the administration
has created difficulties we shall
have to surmount," he said. "We
demand from Mexico the protection
of the lives and property of our citizens
and the security of our border
from depredations."

words known to diplomacy iin amhas- fr;

life on the Lusitania.
Discussing preparedness, Mr.
Hughes said it was apparent that th"
United States was "shockingly unpre

Mr. Hughes closed with an en- i
dorseiuont of the Republican platform,
