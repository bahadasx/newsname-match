The wheat ield for Boone Count
will not average more than nine or
ten bushels to the acre this ear and
the total leld will not be more than
half of the ield of last ear This
will mean still hgihcr prices for
flour net ear, and the pi ices now
are already 40 cents a hundred pounds
higher than at this time last vcar
Last vear on August 1 flour sold at
$:! 20 a hundred. It is now selling
at $3 GO and likelv will be higher.
II n Baker of the Boone Count
.Milling Compan said that the qualit
of the wheat this vear is much bet
ter than last ear. This is due to
the dr weather. Last ear much of
the wheat marketed here had sprout
ed because of the heavy rainfall. Ac
cording to Air Baker, wheat is aver
aging sit-two pounds to the bushel
Ijist .vear fifty-eight pounds was a
high average.
Much of the wheat from the bottom
lands of Boone County has alread
been marketed at the mill here. Wheat
from the uplands is just starting to
come in Owing to the driess of the
season, the farmers in the uplands of
the county dclacd their threshing in
oider to harvest their hay crops and
give their corn closer attention
According to Mr. Baker, it will be a
problem with farmers to obtain suf
ficient seed wheat this fall, owing to
the shortness of the crop He said
that many farmers are already try
ing to get a line on seed wheat for
fall sowing and that the mill has re
ceived many inquiries.

BERLIN', Aug. 1. Although the
German Xational Committee for Hon

identically at all the gatherings, there

The Honorable Peace movement was
begun by the Kaiser to unify the em

Although the crowd was small to
day, the directors say they are pleased
with the first day and expect record-
breaking crowds for the rest of the
fair. The election kept away a great
number todav.
Dr. W II. Black, president of the
Missouri Viilie College, -gave the final
af-embl address of the Summer Ses
sion tliis, morning In the I'niversity
Auditorium He announced no subject
Cor his address, but, "appling the
principle cf the testing of seed corn,
talked cf the test which is given to
character
"You cannot say which kind of seed
ccrn is Lest," said Doctor Black. "The
Important thing is Will it grow ? Is
it vital" And will it reproduce its
kinJ? Ju-t as with beeds, the great
thing in every profession is to find
whether life is there The scientit.c
principle we are working on toda
was one of the great pronunciations
at the beginning 'Bring forth after
its kind.'"
Every person must bo able to de
velop that which will bring forth after
his kind, according to Doctor Black
The chief thing in teaching is to
make character. Persons of character
are those whoso work is good, whose
thoughts are clear, whose minds are
stable and whose spirits cherish lofty
ideals. This is a matter cf great edu
cational importance toda because of
the things we are preparing to do.
A state concerned about tills voting
toda is a wonderful thing The land
is only the area over which certain
ideals re'n The state is purely
spiritual 'a marvel personalit' just
as invisible as a soul with its ideals,
purposes and aim
In school work and in life work, we
hove to make something that will
make a state The state is according
to the ideals and purposes that com
pose it. sas Doctor Black "As our
interests become hed in the higher
things, so the lesser tilings become
more important It is a great thing
to be building thoughts to produce
character. It is not so much the
shop that is worth while as the pro
duct of this shop"
The testing of character applies to
the church as well as to the state, ac
cording to Doctor Black He sas the
difference between the church and
state is not one of worth "The great
problem facing the church tada.v is
that of unification There are three
things we ought to da be able to go
from one church to another without
embirrassinent. have a way by which
Christians may come to the ordinances
of the church an where, and provide
that every minister may have the same
ministerial office and character every
w here." Put ourtestof character in
to it; use vour vision and influence
in bringing about this unification, is
the advice of Doctor Mirk
