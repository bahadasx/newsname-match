NEW YORK, Aug. 1.?"America
. first and America efficient." This was
the Blogan with which Charles Evans
Hughes tonight formally accepted the
?Republican nomination for President
before an enthusiastic audience which
thronged Carnegie Hall to capacity.
On the fleg-decked stage from which
jjhejenunciated the Republican policies,
were gathered 300 leaders of the re
united party from all soction of the
country, and from a central tier box
Theodore Roosevelt applauded vigor
ously the nominee's caustic criticisms
|wthe Democratic Administration.
Amid outbursts which at times ap
J^ached tumult, the nominee charac
terized the conduct of the Democrats
in the country's foreigu relations as a
"lamentable sacrifice of national re
pute," and its course in Mexico during
gthe past three years as a "travesty of
international policies." He laih the
blame for the existing conditions of
anarchy, murder and rapine in the ad
Joining Ropublic directly at Mr. Wil
son's door, and described the various
expeditions into Mexico as "the height
of folly."
Mr. Hughes' reference to the sinking
of the Lusitania, and his direct charge
that it resulted from the failure of
this Government to convince forolgu
nations that the words "strict account
ability" meant what they said, brought
the most prolonged applause of the
kevening. The only rival to this demon
stration came when ho declared that
he favored woman's suffrage, and be
lieved that the granting of universal
suffrage should not bo delayed, be
cause delay would intensify a feminist
movement which would subvert nor
mal issues.
United States Senator Warren G.
Harding of Ohio, who was chairman
Eofpthe Republican National Conven
tion, formally notified Mr. Hughes of
JWb nomination.
J The large audience which crowded
Carnegie Hall to capacity cheered 'or
several minutes when Mr. Hughes ap
peared shortly after 8 o'clock.
The nominee, recognizing Theodore
Roosevelt in one o fthe boxes, waved
his hand to him, and Colonel Roose
velt clapped his hands in acknwledge
ment
Mr. Hughes waB frequently inter
rupted by laughter and applauso.
After delivering his speech, Mr.
Hughes was host at a reception to the
