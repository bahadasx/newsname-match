Clearwater Organizes.
Bagley, Aug. 1. (By Special
Correspondent)A large and
enthusiastic meeting of Jefferson
highway boosters took place at
Bagley Saturday evening. Ten
delegates from Clearbrook and
four from Shevlin attended the
meeting.
The Clearwater County Jeffer
son Highway club was organ
ized. The following directors
were elected: A. Kaiser and M.
J. Kolb of Bagley, L. Jensen
and T. O. Nelson of Clearwater,

The Jefferson highway from Win
nipeg to NeyjL Orleans wj.ll be~Com-,
pleted in 1921, according to J. D.
Clarkson, general manager of the Jef
ferson Highway association. Already
25 per cent of the highway has been
built and money for another 25 per
cent has been subscribed.
Strong as Iron.
"The Jefferson Highway associa
tion is as strong as iron," said Mr.
Clarkson in Winnipeg Sunday. "Mem
bership to the association is purely a
voluntary matter, according to the
interest taken in the project of build
ing 2,000 miles of hard surface road,
which we intend to be known as a
365-day road, open to travel all the
year round. In places the road will
be constructed of gravel, in places
of concrete and in others of macadam.
Make Trip in 10 Days.
"I figure that right now an auto
can make the through trip, given
fair weather, and without putting
the party to any inconvenience in the
way of forced driving, in about ten
days."
The complete route of the Jefferson
highway has now been mapped out.
It was completed when the sociability
run from St. Joseph, Mo., to Winnipeg
was completed Friday night at Win
nipeg.
5,000 Signs Ordered.
Mr. Clarkson in a statement said
that 5,000 enamel signs had been or
dered, each of which are two feet and
a half long and eight inches wide.
They will bear the legend "Jefferson
HighwayFrom Pine to PalmWin
nipeg to New Orleans," and will be
placed at every crossroad on the route.
The signs can be seen 200 feet away
and will be so pointed that a driver
can see the route to follow. Besides
the signs, telephone poles will be
marked with the Jefferson highway
sign, a blue and white sign with the
initials J. H. Printed upon it.
First Signs Posted.
The first of these signs were posted
in Winnipeg last evening by Mayor
Waugh.
A person will be able to make the
entire trip as soon as the signs are
posted without asking a single ques
tion, according to Mr. Clarkson.
Many tours are being planned for
along the highway. This fall, about
the latter part of October, Hon. Paul
Nesbit, representative of the Okla
homa legislature, of McAlester, Okla.,
will travel the route and will sing the
old plantation songs and give a lec
ture upon the south. Mr. Nesbit
passed through Bemidji with the
highway officials last week and was
very much enthused in regard to the
lakes around Bemidji. He is plan

Ytfrkf Aug. J* By
United Press)Charles' Evan
Hughes today declared for a wo
man's suffrage amendment to the
Constitution in a telegram to
Senator Sutherland of Utah.
Hughes said: "My view is that
the proposed amendment should
be submitted and ratified."
New York, Aug. 1.Charles E.
Hughes, former justice of the United
States supreme court, was officially
notified last night that he was the
Republican choice for the presidency.
Senator Harding, who was chairman
of the Republican national conven
tion, formally notified Mr. Hughes.
Outlines Issues.
Mr. Hughes in an address of ac
ceptance outlined the issues upon
which he will conduct his campaign
for the presidency.
He assailed the administration for
the course it has pursued with refer
ence to Mexico, maintenance of Am
erican rights during the European
war, preparedness and other great
questions of the day. He declared
for a new policy of "firmness and
consistency" towards Mexico, for "the
unflinching maintenance of all Am
erican rights on land and sea" and
for "adequate naval defense ade
quate protection on both our west
ern and eastern coast."
Criticizes Administration.
The nominee criticized the admin
tration for its "direction of diplo
matic intercourse" from the begin
ning, declaring that where there
should have been conspicuous
strength and expertness there has
been weakness and inexpertness. He
cited San Domingo as an instance
where "trust was shockingly be
trayed by appointment given to the
deserving democrats" and in the fail
ure to "continue Ambassador Herrick
at his post in Paris after the war had
started as "a lamentable sacrifice of
international repute."
