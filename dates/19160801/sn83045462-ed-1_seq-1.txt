Teutons in a Predicament.
The Russian offensive conducted ir
uoth these directions has been so vigorous
and unrelenting that the AustroGermans
apparently have been in s
predicament, not knowing from which
point to spare troops to reinforce th?
defense of some other part of the front
The result has been that the German*
are exclusively occupied with the defense
of Kovel, while von Boehmbrmolli's
army, without assistance, ha*
been mainly striving to protect th<
roads to Lemberg.
Of the two objectives. Kovel is in th<
positlonof greater danger, being threat
ened from the west, where the Russian*
have successfully passed the Stokhoc
river, and from the south, where th?
Russians recently reached an advance*
point on the VUdlmir-Volynskl road

Make Campaign on What They .
Believe Democratic Weakness.
t
' Republican politicians of the 1
. House of Representatives are
1 clearly satisfied with the speech
, of acceptance delivered by Judge
' Hughes at Carnegie Hall in New
' York last night. The fact that
' the Mexican situation stands out
j above other issues is taken on
? Capitol Hill to indicate that a
- live and vital issue is to be made
t of this point during the coming
campaign. As one member of
the House pointed out, that '
1 . . <
, question is a very interesting one
0 in states from which thousands
r of guardsmen have been sent to
> the border.
Taken all In all, republicans seem to
be extremely gratified by the utter.j
ances of their leader; and, on the other
, hand, the democrats have the attitude
t today of believing the worst is over.
s While several of them look on the Mex.
ican situation as the most dangerous
"j spot in their record, they believe that
f the democratic record in other respects
is far too good to be hurt by the line
s of attack outlined in the Hughes :

- speech,
e
Mexican Policy Important Issue. 1
t "Judge Hughes clearly indicates the
line of advance in the republican campaign,"
said Representative John J.
Esch of Wisconsin, a member of the I (
republican congressional campaign
committee. "It shows that the Mexi- |
t can question is to be a campaign issue, i
I That question is a live and vital one
in many parts of the country, especially
in slates where large numbers of national
guardsmen have gone to the s
border. i
"The suffrage question and the defense
auestion, touched upon by Judge
Hughes, place him squarely In the forefront
on those matters without sidestepping;
however, the foreign policies
of the administration form the main
argument. We have been going forward
and hack in u vacillating manner,
not getting anywhere at all, and
it will be the best thing that could
happen to us to initiate and carry on
a strong foreign policy?especially a
Mexican policy.'
"The speech hits the Mexican failure
on the head," said Representative
Cary of Wlscon-ln, "and is good In
every other respect, too. The speech
certainly ought to wake up the country
to the folly of a wavering policy
with foreign nations."
"The speech was conceived by a logical
and judicial mind and delivered
with the punch of a political leader,"
said Representative Greene of Vermont,
-nuolican.
"The speech clearly presents all the

I
issues of the campaign." said Representative
Nicholas Longworth, republican,
of Ohio.
"The clear and clean declaration that
the republican party stands for the
safeguarding of our economic independence
is a complete summary of all
the tariff arguments," said- Representative
Hill of Connecticut, republican
tariff frxpert. "Thank the Rord for a
real man. Our candidate. Mr. Hughes.,
puts it right up to Mr. Wilson to show
where he stands with the platform
which he 1 a said to have written. Mr.
Hughes' suffrage declaration Is delicious."
"The speech was a winner," said Representative
James R. Mann of Illinois
In a brief review of the statement.
"Real Man as Our Candidate."
Representative Hill, veteran republican
member of Congress from Connecticut,
said: "The clear, clean-cut declaraion
that 'the republican party stands

is a complete summary of
ill protective tariff arguments. Thank
he Rord for a real man as our candilate.
"Mr. Hughes puts it squarely up to

j SEE LITTLE NEW
I IN HUGHES'SPEECH:
i
: President's Friends Say Republican
Candidate Has Not
Worried Them a Bit.
"COMPLETE LAY-DOWN,"
IS BURLESON VERDICT
! Democratic Leaders Say Administration's
Policies Are Criticised Without
Any Suggestion for Belief.
Democratic visitors to the1
White House today were substantially
unanimous that the
speech of Charles E. Hughes last
night had contributed nothing
new to the campaign, and that
the republican candidate for
President must find something
else if he wants to alarm the
democrats or ?ive them worry.
They pointed out that Mr. Hughes
does not raise a single new issue or
drive home with any appreciable or
unusual force the issues already raised
by Roosevelt, Root, Harding, Borah and
other republican speakers. "If the republicans
do not do any better than
this," said one democrat, "then they
| are eternally lost. I do not see how
they are going to find any issues that
} are of sufficient concern to the people
| to make a change against Mr. Wilson,
but so far they have done nothing with
the issues they think they have.'
'Complete Lay-Down,' Says Burleson
Cabinet members were of the same
opinion as other democrats wrho were
at the White House. On their way
into the cabinet session and when assembled
around their chieftain they
were of one accord?that the speech
is not likely to stir serious opposition
to the democrats, and that the plain
truth is the republicans are hard put
for something on which to make their
fight.
Postmaster General Burleson and
Attorney General Gregory were more
j outspoken than other cabinet members,
each pointing out that while ,Mr.
! Hughes criticised freely as to Mexico
he failed to say what he would have
done or what he will do if he is
elected "The speech is worse than I
pussy-footing," said Mr. Burleson. "It
is a complete lay-down. The people
are tired of generalities and expect
candidates to be specific in their promises.
Mr. Hughes does not say what
he would have done in Mexico or what
he will do if he is elected. Generalities
are not going to get votes these
days. The speech suits democrats all
right." . _ . _
Mr. Gregory also declared that Mr.
HugheB ought to state what he proposes
to do, so that the people may
judge as between what President Wilson
has done and a definite plan by
the republican candidate.
President Wilson did not receive any
visitors before the cabinet met, but
cabinet officers reported that he was
in a most satisfactory frame of mind,
contented with the way things are
going and having little fear that the
republican orators will be able to convince
the people that th^ administration
has been wrong on its foreign
policies.
Representative Doremus of Michigan,
chairman of the democratic congressional
campaign committee, said
the "platform constructed by Mr.
Hughes at Carnegie Hall last night
will fall of its own weight before election
day."

HUGHES CHAMPIONS:
NATIONALSUFFRAGE
Declares for Amendment to
Federal Constitution Providing
Votes for Women.
RESPONDS TO AIM INUUIKT
BY SENATOR SUTHERLAND
Believes Question Should Be Defi- i
nitely Settled and Removed
From Political Discussions.
NEW YORK, August 1.?
Charles E. Hughes today declared i
for an amendment to the federal (
Constitution providing for worn- 1
an suffrage. Mr. Hughes' views (
on the subject were made public \
in a letter he has written to i
Senator Sutherland of Utah. ]
Mr. Hughes' letter to Senator George
Sutherland was in reply to a telegram '
received from the senator asking the j
nominee to define his personal position
with regard to the equal suffrage fed- j
eral amendment.
States His Position.
Mr. Hughes replied as follows:
"Your telegram has been received. In ^
my answer to the notification I did not
refer to the proposed federal amendment
relating to woman's suffrage as
this was noi mentioned in the platform.
I have no objection, however,
to stating my personal views. As I
said in my speech, I think it to be
v-,1fhot tho nnpst inn of
woman suffrage should be settled
promptly. The question is of such a
nature that it should be settled for the
entire country.
"My view is that the proposed amendment
should be submitted and ratified
and the subject removed from political
discussion."
Senator Sutherland's Telegram.
Senator Sutherland's telegram to the
nominee, sent from Salt Lake City last
night, reads as follows:
"You will no doubt recall our conversation
a few days ago. when I urged you
to make public your views with regard to
the equal suffrage federal amendment. I
feel quite sure there is nothing in the republican
platform which in any manner
would conflict with such a declaration.
That platform commits the party to the
principle of woman suffrage and recognizes
the right of each state ti determine
the question for itself.
"It is silent upon the subject of constitutional
amendment and therefore
leaves everybody of the party free to ,
determine for himself this question.
The submission of the amendment is
desired by many millions of voters and ;
I think the day is coming when Congress
should recognize this widespread
desire by adopting the 'resolution of
submission* and thus enabling the
states to pass upon the question, which,
with ut the preliminary action of Congress,
they will be prevented from doJ
ing.
Matter of ''Intense Interest."
"There is a feeling of intense interest ,
in all these suffrage states in respect to
your attitude and I think it most important
that you should, as soon as
possible, state publicly jour present
nosition in rftSDect to the matter."
Mr. Hughes was asked today for a
statement on the reception given him
last night, when he delivered his speech
of acceptance. He said:
To my> mind it was a most gratifying
reception. It seemed to me that it.
showed most conclusively that there
was no misunderstanding with respect
to the issues of the campaign. We have
had an inadequate administration and
I think the American people know it."Mr.
Hughes' Announcement
for Suffrage Amendment
Gives Joy to Women's Union
News of Mr. Hughes' announcement-.,
was received with unbounded enthusiasm
at the headquarters of the Con- 1
gressional Union for Women's Suffrage.
Statements were issued by Miss Maud
Younger. Miss Lucy Burns and Mrs. J
Abby Scott Baker, predicting that the J
women of the'west would rally to the
support of Mr. Hughes, and contrasting
his attitude with tbe insistence of
President Wilson that suffrage is a
state issue.
Miss Lucy Burns, chairman of the
Congressional Union for Woman Suffrage,
late today sent the following
telegram to Mr. Hughes:
"The Congressional Union for Woman
Suffrage congratulates you most earnestly
on the statesmanlike position
you have taken in favor of woman suffrage
by federal amendment. Women
throughout the nation are your
debtors."

The Works amendment abolishing the
District of Columbia as such and the
half-and-half plan and "providing that
the government pay all the expenses of
the District and the citisens pay into
the federal Treasury a fair tax, was defeated
in the Senate today by a vote of
53 to 12. The senators who Joined with
Senator Works in supporting his
amendment were Senators Ashurst,
Borah. Clapp. James, Jones. Kenyon, La
Follette, Lane, Norris, Sheppard and
Vardarrian.
Senator Works then offered an
amendment to strike from the bill the
half-and-half provision, leaving it so
that the United States would pay for all
of the expenses of the District. This
was quickly voted down, and a direct
vote on the question of sustaining the
half-and-half provision in accordance
with the act of 1878 began.
Senator John Walter Smith of Mary
ia.uu igaay ksvc nouc?* in mc ociuko
that he would insist upon the District
appropriation bill's being: kept continuously
before the Senate ? during the
working hours of that body?until It is
disposed of. The District bill is the unfinished
business of the Senate and was
taken up last Friday, when it was practically
completed, except for the Senate
committee amendments restoring the
half-and-half plan, providing for the
acquisition of the Dean tract, for a biennial
assessment of real estate and for
the municipal hospital. Since that day
much of the time has been given by the
Senate to the consideration of other
matters.
When the bill was laid before the
Senate today. Senator Works of California
again addressed the Senate on
the subject of his amendment which j
would abolish the half-and-half plan. '
3o away with the District government t
as a municipality and make it a bureau
of the federal government and
have the federal government pay all
the expenses of the District, the citizens
here to continue to pay a fair
tax.
Should Not Be Municipality.
He went at some length into the history
of the organic act of 1878, which
provides for the half-and-half plan,
to establish his argument that the
District is not really a municipality
tnd cannot be so considered under the
Constitution of the United States.
Senator Works insisted' also that the
lalf-and-half plan of caring for the
District's expenditures had not been
ived up to as a matter of fact In the
>ast, and that, therefore, the abollshnent
of the half-and-half plan would
lot really mean a change in law.
Some years, he said, the assessments
paid by the people of the District have
been more than half of the appropriations
made for the District and other
vears the appropriations have been
*i,? k.
greater man iwitc mc o...wuiu
assessments. The half-and-half plan,
he insisted, has not really existed In
fact.
"Tn a sort of a hit and miss way the
ippropriations for the District have
iveraged up about half from the District
and half fron: the federal Treasury."
said Senator Works. "This was
true until two years ago, when the
issessments were revised and the citieens
of the District paid in in fixes
considerably more than their half of th6
Lppropriations."
Says Legislation Is Hampered.
Senator Works quoted from Justice j
Siddons to the effect that the half-andlalf
plan had frequently prevented
nuch needed legislation for the Disrict,
owing to the fact that it limited
he government to matching dollar for
tollar the revenues raised in the Diarlct
when appropriations were made,
ie also' quoted Justice Siddons as sayngr
that he had been favorably lm ressed
with the amendment offered by
{enator Works.
"I have had som6 glimmering hope?
aint. I confess?of seeing the District
f Columbia extricated from its present
osition before 1 left Congress." said
enator Works. "But the vacant seats
i the Senate chamber today show me
hat the senators have very little interst
in this matter."
Sen?t-?r works <*ai?I t*?at Senator Galnger
had found difficulty In the matter
f adopting the Works plan. Senator
Vorks insisted that they were only
naginary. Senator Galllnger interiipted
to say that he had been a menter
of the District committee for twenf-two
years and for twelve years
