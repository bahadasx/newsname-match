ADMINISTRATION
ARRAIGNED BY
HUGHES
Democratic Policies Scored By Re
publican Nominee
PROGRAM IN MEXICO CONDEMNED
American Rights Have Not Been
Safeguarded Either on Land
o: Sea.
New York, July 31. Charles B.
Hughes tonight outlined in his speech
of acceptance, the issues upon Which
he will conduct his campaign for the
presidency. Mr. Hughes assailed the
administration tor the course it has
pursued with refemce to Mexico,
maintenance of American rights dur
ing the Kuropean war, preparedness
and other great questions of the day.
He declared for a new policy of "Arm
ness and consistency" toward Mexico,
for the "unllnching maintenance of
all American rights on land and sea"
and for "adequate national defence;
adequate protection on both our west
ern and eastern coasts."
"We denounce all plots and conspir
acies in the interest of any foreign na
tion." Mr. Hughes said. "Utterly in
tolerable is the use of our soil lor
alien intrigues, livery American mutt
unreservedly condemn them and sup
port every ' effort for their suppres
sion," The nominee assailed the admini
stration for its "direction of diplo
matic intercourse," from the begin,
nlng. declaring that where there
should have been conspicuous
strength and expertness there hul
been weakness and lnexpertness. He
cited Santo Domingo as an instance
where appointments had gone to "de
serving Democrats" and to the failure
to continue Ambassador Herrick at
Ills post in Paris after war had stall
ed as "a lamentable sacrlflc of Inter
national repute."
One-fourth of the speech was devot
ed to Mexico. Step by step taken by ,
the administration with reference to
Mexico was assailc-d, from the days of
Huerta to the note to the present de
facto government by the state depart
ment June 20. last, part of which was
quoted In the Speech.
"To attempt to control the domes
tic concerns of Mexico." Mr. Hughes
said, "Was simply intervention, not
less so because disclaimed. The
height of folly was to have a vacillat
ing and Ineffective Intervention.
The seizure of the Vera Cruz, the
nominee said, was war. of course."
"Later we retired from Vera Cruz."
he continued, "giving up this noble
warfare. We had not obtained the
salute which we demanded. We hail
not obtained reparation for affronts.
"Recently the naked truth was ad
mitted by a cabinet officer. We
are now informed that we did not go

MOB IS TOO SMALL
Citizens, Senators and Soldiers Need
ed for Julius Caesar.
Are you a Roman citizen? If not,
why not? A crowd of one hundred
soldiers, senators and citizens is need
ed to make a good sized mob in the
performance of Julius Caesar at the
Clarke Woods Thursday, Friday and
Saturday. We are practically certain
that the group which gathered at the
last rohoarsal does not represent all
the able bodied men in the townshtf,
of Bennington. Where are the rest?
All that Is required of them is that
they have two legs and one lung.
Beautiful costumes are provided,
actors have free admission to all the
perfdrmanceSi and there is only one
more rehearsal.
People are expected from all direc
tions to witness this production,
which has been heralded far and
wide. Julius Caesar is an ambitious
undertaking for a town of this size, a
fact which has been commented up
on, and for which we have been
praised more than once by our nev fr
paper neighbors. Our town has been
more or less noted for ambitious un
dertakings in the past, and never y.'t
have its citizens failed to respond to
an S. O. S. call. This is in the natur;
oi an S. O. S.
The final and dress rehearsal takes
place at six o'clock on Wednesday
evening in the Clarke Woods. Will
not every man and hoy over 16 years
of age. who reads this, and withes to
help the Welfare Association and put
another credit mark on the side of
our patriotic town, come to that dres.i
rehearsal on Wednesday as BOOO after
6 as possible, prepared to take the
part of a soldier, a senator. o: a
citizen? If rain interferes with the
out-door rehearsal, please meet In
Library hall at seven.
to Vera Cruz to force Huerta to salute
the Hag. We are told that we went
there to 'show Mexico that we were in
earnest in our demand that Huerta
must go.' That is, we seized Vera
Cruz to depose Huerta. The question
of the salute was a mere pretext."
America, Mr. Hughes continued,
had no policy of aggression toward
Mexico, DOS desire for any part of it
territory, but wished It to have peace,
stability and prosperity.
"The conduce of the ndmlsint ration
has raised difficulties we shall have to
siinuont," he said. "We shall have to
adopt a new policy, a policy of firm
ness and consistency through which
alone we can promote an enduring
friendship. We demand from Mexico
the protection of the lives ami proper
ty of our citizens and the security of
our border from depredations."
Safeguarding American rights
nbioad had not been socomplishi i.
Mr. Hughes said, by the administra
tion. There had been "brave words
in a series of notes, but what does it
avail to us sole of the strongest words
known to diplomacy if ambassadors
Can receive the impression that tho
words are not to be taken lefiousl) ?"
The nominee reiterated his declara
tion that had this government left no
doubt that it meant to hold Germany
to "Strict accountability" there would
have been no loss of lite on the Lusi
tanla. During this period he said, ihc
only danger of war lay in the weak
course of the administration,

JOHN DILLON STARTS DEBATE
Premier Asquith's Consiliatory Speech
Fails to Appease Redmond Who
Shows Hostility.
London, .Inly 31. Henry Edward
Duke, a barrister and Unionist mem
ber of Parliament for Exeter, was to
day appointed to be the new chief sec
retary for Ireland in succession to
Augustine Hirrell. The new chief sec
retary will be given a seat in the cabi
net. No new Lord Lieutenant of Ire
land will he appointed to succeed
Lord Wimborne, who resigned after
the outbreak of the Dublin rebellion.
The Irish question came up In a de
bate in the House of Commons to
day on John Dillion's motion, urging
the government to disclose its plan
lor I he government of Ireland during
the war, and the prospect of an amic
able settlement of the Irish problem
seems to be as distant as before.
Premier Asrjuith made a concilia
tory speech, but he had little to an
nounce tending to appease National
ist susceptibility. For. although he
expressed the conviction that a per;
manent settlement would be reached
sooner than many persons imagined,
John Redmond, the Nationalist leader,
tnade it clear that his party was dis
satisfied and would, henceforth, con
Sider Itself absolved from association

free to criticize and oppose it inde
