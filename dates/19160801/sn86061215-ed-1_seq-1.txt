HOT SPELL GIVES
LET UP IN CONSTANT RAINS PER
MITS DELAYED ASSAULT
UPON THE GERMANS.
With the Brtish army In the field,
July 30, via London, July 31.—French
and British soldiers made today's at
tack in sweltering mid summer heat.
The first real hot wave of the season
struck northern France last night and
this morning British and French in
fantry cooperated in an action north
of the Somme, in front of Guillemont
and Maurepas.
For the last few days the one word
on everybody's tongue has been visi
bility, which has come into universal
use since Admiral Jellicoe's first fleet
dispatch. Formerly artillerymen spoke
of good and bad light. Persistent bad
light or low visibility, which did not
permit the gunners to register their
targets, had delayed any important in
fantry action. Yesterday the light be
came better as the heat grew tropic
and offensive operations were renewed.
Every day the Germans have been
Increasing the number of guns and
men in the Guillemont section, which
is among the last portions of high
ground they hold. By prisoners taken
ten German battalions or 10,000 men
have been identified on a front of
2,000 yards where the Germans are
still in their old second line fortifica
tions. The Germans appear to regard
this sector of critical importance since
the British broke the second line on
the adjoining front of two miles on
July 14.
Fight for Every Inch.
Part of the .British attack struck
from the bloody Trones wood and the
other part on the flank while the Ger
mans tried to man machine guns as
usual after a British bombardment.
The Germans resisted bitterly, fighting
under the broiling sun as if every
inch of ground was precious.
The British got possession of the
railroad station which they had reach
ed In a previous attack. Some of the
attackers got Into Guillemont and
reached the church where the Ger
mans, swarming in dugouts, outnum
bered the advance party which fought
against their foe on all sides. It was
one of those hand to hand and hide
and seek conflicts in the village ruins
of indescribable ferocity. The British
had to retire from the edge of Guille
mont but made good a considerable
advance southward on the flank of the
town where, through the hot night,
fighting continued to maintain their
gain.
Covered With Dust.
Perspiration made white ^ater
courses in the dust of the men's faces
today and their eyes loked out through
masks so thick that their faces seemed
to be covered with some kind of ar
mor. Motor trucks passed like phan
toms in thick clouds on the road. Gun
ners, stripped to the skin, kept on serv
ing their guns at top speed.
Soldiers who reached Guillemont
speak of the fearful carnage among
the Germans from the British gunfire,
owing to the masses of Germans con
centrated under the British bombard
ment before the infantry attacks.
With the news of the shooting of Cap
tain Fryatt fresh in their minds the
British went into the charge in a fury
swearing they#would avenge his death.

tion by Southern democrats. Defeat

sion were conducting investiga
tions to determine the cause of
and fix the responsibility for the
great ammunition explosion in
Jersey City yesterday morning
with Its heavy toll of death. Injury
and destruction, Mayor Mark
Fagan, of Jersey City, announced
that he would demand a congres
sional Investigation. He said that
such an Investigation was neces
sary In order to enact more string
ent laws for the transportation and
storage of high explosives than
are provided In the present regu
lations of the Interstate commerce
commission.
Not much stock was taken by
authorities today in the charges
made last night add this morning
that the explosion was due to the
activities of people in this coun
try whose sympathies are with
the foes of the allied governments
to whom the munitions cargoes
were consigned.
Latest estir
New York, July 31.—Two men are
under arrest today on warrants
charging them with manslaughter, In
directly causing. the death of one of
the victims of the terrific explosion
of ammunition on Black Tom pier
early yesterday morning. Estimates
of the casualties early today placed
the number of dead at three, with
three others mortally injured, thirty
five suffering from less serious in
juries and eleven to twenty missing.
Estimates of the property loss range
from $25,000,000 to $45,000,000.
Many persons who were on board
barges moored at the burned piers are
missing and it is feared that they have
perished. In some quarters it was
believed the number of dead would
reach twelve.
Those under arrest were Albert M.
Dickman, agent of the Lehigh Valley
railroad, stationed at Black Tom pier
and Alexander Davidson, superintend
ent of the warehouses of the National
Storage Co., thirteen of which were
destroyed by the fire which followed

son, president of a lightering com
pany, one of whose barges loaded with
ammunition is alleged to have been
moored at the pier.
Laws Violated.
Sri-
Frank Hague, commissioner of pub-
lie safety of Jersey City, charged that
the blame -of the explosion lay with
either the Lehigh Valley railroad com
pany, the storage company or .the
them had violated the laws of New
Jersey, the Jersey City ordinances, and
the rules of the interstate commerce
commission by permitting barges
loaded with explosives to remain
Kioored at the piers over night. These
barges were being used to transport
the ammunition to steamers lying in
Gravesend bay.
Several Investigations were com-'
menced today to discover the origin
of the fire which caused the awful ex
plosion that destroyed $5,600,000 worth
of ammunition, eighty-five freight
cars, set blazing ammunition barges
adrift to bombard the statue of liberty
and the Ellis Island immigration sta
tion with shells and shrapnel, and shat
tered $100,000 worth of windows in
this city.
Islands Bombarded.
The big pier just west of the Btatue
of liberty Is today a mass of smoking
ruins. Work of repairing the damage
to the buildings on Bedloe.'s and Ellis
islands and in New York and Jersey
City began this morning. The immi
gration station at Ellis Island had the
appearance of a war swept village
with every window shattered, the roof
of the hospital caved in, the main door
blown away and tl*e dining and
executive rooms wrecked, while the
island was strewn with bits of
shrapnel, broken glass and three-Inch
shells thrown ashore from drifting

WAVE DUE
FORECAST GALES
FOB QUICK BELIEF
GOVERNMENT WEATHER EX
PERTS SAY TORRID SPELL
TO BE BROKEM.
Chicago, July 81. —Chicago and the
middle west today awaited the drop in
temperatures promised by tomorrow
at the latest, which was expected to
break the long heat spell.
It was said at the weather bureau
that the cool wave would be felt in
Chicago possibly by tonight at seven
o'clock and that by daylight tomorrow
morning it will be pleasant.
The government temperature here at
7 o'clock this morning was 82 degreeB,
three degrees lower than on Saturday
morning at the same time. Brisk
winds gave added relief.
Chicago, after yesterday's sad spec
tacle of 116 deaths attributed to the
heat and more than 400 prostrations,
for the most part slept out doors again
last night. .Parks were crowded. More
than 180,000 persons spent yesterday
and last night in Lake Michigan.
The record breaking death rate of
the last week has seriously tested the
facilities of the coroner's office, while
the prostrations have taxed accommo
dations of local hospitals and burdened
the city's physicians to the limit. Up
wards of fifty babies succumbed to
the heat yesterday.
Among the animals the death rate
has almost established a new record.
Dead horses were reported lying along
streets in many sections of the city.
Relief from the torrid temperature
was felt today over the country west
of Chicago as far as the Rocky moun
tains and north of a line drawn
through northern Iowa. The cool
wave gradually moved south today
and is expected to reach central Illi
nois this afternoon or tomorrow,
though the drop in temperature is not
expected to equal that here or In the
north. In some points in southern Illi
nois and its latitude the temperature
is likely to remain slightly above nor
mal, it is predicted.
While the extreme heat in Chicago
lasted about three weeks, in the plains
states generally it reigned about a
month.
RELIEF FOR IOWA.
Des Moines, July 81.—Local shoVers
were reported today from a number of
cities in Iowa, giving rise to the belief
at the Iowa weather bureau that the
back bone of the hot wave, which has
continued in this state for nearly a
month, has been broken.
Local showers were reported to have
been general over the northeast sec
tion of the state and rain also was re
ported to have fallen at Burlington,
Keokuk and Davenport. Conditions, it
was said, had changed in many por
tions of the state since 7 a. m., when
information on which the forecast for
the next twenty-four hours was based
was received.
Dr. Chappell of the weather bureau
said that the showers reported could
not be considered a general rain but
that they would "probably save, for
the present, the corn crop in the local
ities visited."
Rain was reported at noon in Mar
shalltown, Fort Dodge /and Boone,
Iowa. Cooler weather prevailed at
Cedar Rapids, but no rain had fallen.
Crop conditions in all sections where
rain fell, were reported excellent.
There was no rain at Waterloo but the
temperature had fallen to 91 from yes
terday's maximum of 104.
Iowa City was one of the hottest
points in the state yesterday, the mer
cury reaching 101 during the after
noon. Today It had fallen to 97.
DAVENPORT SWELTERS.
Davenport, July 31. —Half a dozen
prostrations and one fatality resulted
from Sunday's high temperature of
100 degrees in this city.
Max Phal, a restaurant keeper, was
overcome by the torrldity during the
evening and died before medical at
tendance could reach him. One of
those prostrated was M. Melnert, vet
eran telegraph editor of Der Demokrat,
local German dally. He waB taken to
a hospital and latest reports indicate
he will recover.
RAIN IN BURLINGTON.
Burlington, July 31. —With the
temperature at 82 degrees this morn
ing, followed by heavy clouds and cool
ing winds from the west, rain began
falling here at 9 o'clock. This is the
first break in the hot spell experienced
here in two weeks.
CLOUDBURST AT DECATUR.
Decatur, 111., July 31.—After a month
without rain, Decatur was visited by
a cloudburst today. The temperature
dropped thirty degrees in fifteen min

a hail storm. The streets were flood
ed with water.
COOLER AT DUBUQUE.
Dubuque, July 31.—Five persons
died here during alst night as a result
of being prostrated with heat Sunday.
