the Austro-Germans back and fought

It was officially announced by the Rus
sian war department today.
All Teutonic counter attacks in the
Kovel and Lutsg regions, the state
ment adds, were repulsed by the Rus
sians. Turks on Scene.
Berlin, July 31, (via London, Aug. 1,
12:05 p. m.) Turkish officers are now
a familiar sight in Lemberg and the
vanguard of the Turkish troops being
cent to the southeastern battle fronS
has already been detrained, according
to dispatches from the Galician capi
tal. The German commanders are
biding their time to launch their coun
ter blow at the Russians.
The Teutonic retirement on the
Lutsk front from Kiselin, west of
Lutsk, northward to the point where
the Kovel-Sarny railroad crosses the
Stokhod and the abandonment of the
convoluted line following the meander
ing course of the Stokhod is regarded
here without apprehension and, in
fact, as in a certain way, a hopeful sign
as the new line, cutting across the
big bend in the Stokhod. is only about
28 miles long, in contrast with the ap
proximate 53 miles of the former front.
Appropriately smaller force is capable
of defending it, the surplus thus being
released for employment elsewhere.
On the western front the British, say
German war critics appear to be on the
point of reattempting to crush the Ger
man front north of the Anere brook in
an attempt to reach Bapaume from

Plot Victim
Chicago, Aug. 1. Two bombs be
lieved to have been made of dynamite
were exploded this morning under the
building of the Jewish Daily Press,
whose publisher. A- M. Liebling, was
a witness for the state in the recent
trial of a 6core of labor leaders
charged with conspiracy here.
At the time of the trial Mr. Lieb
ling told Assistant State's Attorney
Raber that his life had been threat
ened because he had told the grand
jury what he knew of the methods of
the labor union representatives .
The bombs were placed near the
front door of the building. Mr. Lieb
ling, his wife and three children were
thrown from their beds on the second
floor. A night watchman also narrowly
escaped injury.
The Daily Press building was badly
damaged. Windows in adjoining build
ings and across the street were
broken.
Detectives are working on the theory
that the bomb attack was the result
of Leibling's testimony at the labor
trial.
The presses, however, were not dam
aged and the printing and editorial
force went to work as usual, Mr. Lieb
ling taking his seat a few feet from
the door at which the bombs exploded.
Policemen and detectives stood guard
about the plant.
This was the second bomb explosion
directed against witnesses for the state
in the labor trial. During the trial a
bomb was exploded at the restaurant
of Thomas H. Petrakos.
Fourteen of the 17 labor leaders
tried were convicted.

Hague Scene
of Socialist
Peace IsLeet
London, Aug. 1. The complete re
establishment of the independence of
Belgium and Poland and a democratic
federal union of the Balkan states were
points unanimously agreed upon at the
opening of the international socialist
conference at The Hague yesterday,
according to a detailed account of the
session received here.
Pieter Jelles Toelstra, head of the
Dutch delegation, said that national
differences among the belligerent so
cialists were still too strong for united
socialist action. He urged all socialists
to speedily realize the tasks confront
ing them.
The question of Belgian independ
ence was raised when a letter was
read from Emile Van Der Velde, the
Belgian minister of munitions. Min
ister Van Der Velde insisted the con
ference should declare itself unre
servedly for the restoration of his na
tive land. There was no opposition to
this but it was decided not to attempt
to deal with the thorny question of
Alsace-Lorraine. Algernon Lee, the
American representative and socialist
candidate for the governorship of New
York, reviewed the effect of the war on
socialist organizations in America. He
said that during the first year the in
fluence was very depressing but that
they have thoroughly recovered now.
Mr. Lee said that though a small so
cialist wing in America is pro-German
and perhaps a somewhat larger sec
tion definitely anti-German, the great
bulk of the party thought it would be
best if neither side was crushingly de
feated. The American delegate said that the
United States had its own problem in
a very strong militarist movement
which had grown up there.
After the conference, Mr. Lee said
that the delegates were united on the
ground that the war shoudl not result
in either annexation or indemnities.
COUNTY PENSION
ACT IS INVALID
Decision On Legislative Measure
Handed Down in Court of Judge
Charles Foell.
is
Chicago, Aug. 1. A decision de
claring invalid an act of the
Illinois legislature creating county
pension funds in all counties havinq
populations of 15,000 or more was
handed down today by Judge Charles
Foell in the superior court. The act
was passed in June, 1915.
Judge Foell held that had the act
embraced civil service employes of the
county only it might have been valid
but inasmuch as the senate added an
amendment including county officers
who are not under civil service the act
was invalid.
Suit against the Cook county clerk
was begun by employes of the county
to restrain him from collecting $2
monthly out of their pay as a dona
tion towards the fund. ,No collections
nor contributions ever were made in
this county as the suit was brought
soon after the act became law.
The sheriff and clerk of a
county Judge Foell said, would
suffer a hardship through the
workings of the act since though thev
cannot succeed themselves they wouli
be forced to donate to the fund. The
county clerk said he was in favor of
the decision.

Kaiser Puts
Approval on
Work of Men
Amsterdam, Aug. 1 (via London, 11
a. m.) Emperor William, according
to a telegram today from Berlin, has
Issued the following proclamation to
the German forces on land and Bea:
"Comrades, the second year of the
world war'bas, elapsed. Like the first
year, it was for Germany's arms a
year of glory. On all fronts you inflict
ed new and heavy blows on the en
emy. "Whether the enemy retreated,
borne down by the force of your at
tacks, or whether reinforced by for
eign assistance collected and pressed
into service from all parts of the
world, he tried to rob you of the fruits
of former victories, you always proved
yourself superior to him.
"Even where England's tyranny was
uncontested, namely, on the free waves
of the sea, you victoriously fought
against gigantic superiority.
"Your kaiser's appreciation and
your grateful country's proud admira
tion are assured to you for these
deeds, for your unshaken loyalty, for
your bold daring and for your tenac
ious bravery.
"Like the memory of our dead
heroes, your fame also will endure
through all time. The laurels which
our ever-confident forces have won
against the enemy in spite of trials
and dangers are inseparably linked
with the devoted and untiring labor
at home.
"This strength at home has sent an
ever fresh inspiration to the armies
in the field. It has continually quick
ened our swords, has kindled Ger
many's enthusiasm and has terrified
the enemy. My gratitude and that of
the fatherland are due the nation at
home.
"But the strength and will of the
enemy is not yet broken. We must
continue the severe struggle in order
to secure the safety of our beloved
home land, to preserve the honor of
the fatherland and the greatness of
the empire.
"Whether the enemy wages war
with the force of arms or with cold,
calculating malice, we shall continue
as before into the third year of the
war. The spirit of duty to the father
land and an unbending will to victory
permeate our homes and our fighting
forces today as in the first days of the
war. With God's gracious help I am
convinced that your future deeds will
equal those of the past and present.
"Main headquarters.
"WILHELM."

Cleared Pilot On. i
Baltimore, Aug. 1. Arrange,

an official connected with the com
pany operating the Deutschland
for the submarine to leave this
afternoon or this evening.
Baltimore, Aug. 1. Activities Indi
cating the early departure of the Ger
man submarine Deutschland on her
homeward voyage to Germany were
noticed this morning. v
The logs forming the outer barrier
about the submarine were towed into
midstream and anchored. Then the
Timmins and a launch swept the chan
nel with a heavy weight suspended un
der water. This was evidently done as.
a precaution against possible obstruc
tion. Captain Koenig has asked for a pilot
to guide the underwater liner to the
Virginia capes.
The pilot designated was said to be
Captain Owen Coleman of the Mary
land Pilots' association.
The sweeping operations were thor
oughly performed. Not only was the
channel gone over repeatedly, but the
edges also.
The United States coast guard cut
ter Wissahickon arrived from Phila
delphia and took up a position off the
end of the slip.
Later the spar barricade was re
placed Just outside the line, the cov
ered barges which screen the Deutsch
land from the river and the Timmins
returned to their positions alongside
the submersible.
The city police boat Lannan mean
while had joined the Wissahickon and
both boats steamed to the pier. After
a conference between the captains of
these two craft and Deutschland offi
cers the Wissahickon and Lannan
steamed away and it became apparent
that the Deutschland would not leave
immediately.
The Deutschland was expected to
leave at high tide this forenoon.
Owing to the strong adverse wind,
however, the flood Btage was not as
high as required. The pilot was
abroad. The next high tide occurs
between 7 and 9 o'clock this evening.
