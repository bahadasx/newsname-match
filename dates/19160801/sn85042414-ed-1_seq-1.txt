HAIGDECURES
THIRD YEAR Of
WARK ALLIES
After 24 Months, Initiative
Rests With Entente
Armies.
With the British Armies in the
Field. Aug. 1.—At the close of two
years of the war and of the first
month of the British offensive, Gen.
Sir Douglas Halg, commander-in
chief of the group of British armies
in France, speaking of the situation,
laid particular emphasis on the fact
that the beginning of the third year
of the war saw the initiative entirely
with the allies on all fronts, while
England for the first time was exert
ing something like a power worthy of
her numerous resources on land.
"The tide has turned," he said.
"Time has been with the allies from
the first- It is only a question of more
time till we win a decisive victory,
which is the one sure way to bring
peace In this, as in other wars. Until
this victory is won it ill becomes a
British soldier in France to think of
peace."
Those who had the freedom of the
battle lines the last four weeks had
glimpses of the youthful and scholarly
features of Sir Douglas in a passing
automobile on dusty roads, thick with
moving troops and transports, and
again of his athletic flgre alighting
from his car at the headquarters of
oneo the army commanders for a
conference. But mostly his time Is
spent in a quiet room in a small cha
teau, which is his personal headquar
ters.
In the center of this room, where
he talked with the Associated Press
correspondent today, was raised a map
of the region of the offensive, with
every' detail, roads, woods, villages,
trenches, ridges and valleys, and all
"tnaepifteur* revealed at a glance. The
only other visible, machinery of com
mand were. little- sheets of reports
which come from the firing line
through the curtains of shell fire, giv-*
lftg the Situation at intervals In every
sector of the front.
"The problem of the first summer's
campaign, and the second, for the al
lies," he said, "was to hold the Ger
mans from forcing a decision with
their ready numbers of men, guns and
shells. Whether it was the able gen
eralship and heroism of the French
on the Marne, the dogged retreat of
the little British expeditionary force
from Mons, the stubborn resistance of
the French and British to the German
effort for the channel ports, the Rus
sian retreat last summer, Belgium's
or Serbia's sacrifice, Italy's stone
walling against Austria's offensive, or
France's immortal defense of Verdun,
the purpose was always to gain time
for preparations necessary to take the
offensive away from the enemy."
VILLISTAS SUFFER IN
CLASH WITH TROOPS
Chihuahua City, Me*., Aug. 1.
Two clashes between Villistas and
