Show Determination of Em
peror William to Spare
No Efforts.
.ij Paris, Aug. 1, 12:30 a. m. The
. Germans, recruiting with more than
usual vigor north of the Somme, have
made counter attack after counter at
J. tack during the last 2-1 hours without
in any way changing the positions of
the French. According to French of
r ficial reports, all attempts of the Ger-f-
mans to regain lost ground have been
I beaten off by rifle, machine gun and
I artillery fire, while the work of
j . strengthening and adapting the newly
fwon trepches is being carried on
speedily and methodically by the en
gineer corps.
The Fernch commanders regard the
(situation on the whole as excellent
and say that the armies in the rear
of the attacking forces have reached
a pitch of perfection never before
seen. Material of all kinds is In
abundance far exceeding, according
to reports, the actual requirements
and everything Is in readiness for an
attempt to push the advance farther,
when the time is ripe.
The fury of German assaults and
the strength of the effectives engaged
show the determination of the em
peror's generals to spare no effort
'to prevent the French from working
their way along the north bank of the
river by way of Clery to attack Per
onne from two sides.
Aviators report that thj3 Germans
are making feverish efforts to rein

positions about Clery and are gather
ing reserves from several directions.
Heavy fighting is looked for in the
near future.

Will Not Co-operate With Al
lies in Forwarding Shipment
ment to Starving Poles.
NOTE HANDED GERARD
Conditions Imposed Imprac
ticable and Further Negotia
ti6ns Considered Devoid
of Purpose.
Washington, Aug. 1. Germany has
informed the United States she has
refused "on account of the Impracti
cable conditions Imposed by Great
Britain upon the shipments of food
stuffs from America into Poland," to
enter into further negotiations for co
operation in Polish relief work, which
are devoid of purpose.
Owing to favorablo harvest pros
pects, however, the imperial govern
ment says, relief apparently will be
unnecessary after October 1st next.
The German position is stated In a
note handed to Mr. Gerard July 29,
and made public today at the state
department. It apparently is a final
rejection of Great Britain's offer made
in a recent communication acquiesced
in by France to permit the passage
of American food supplies into Poland
on condition that the occupying Teu
tonic armies would not seize or re
move native -products.
iNo mention is made of President
Wilson's personal letter to Emperor
William similar to those sent to other
European rulers appealing for joint ac
tion in arranging to feed the starv
ing Poles.
Reply Sent by Germany.
The note Is in reply to indontlcal
communication ssent by the state de
partment to all of the belligerents
concerned.
The text follows:
"From the very beginning the im
perial government declared its readi
ness to offer its assistance in order
that the distress apparent in those
parts of Russia which are occupied
by German troops and systematical
ly wasted and deprived to all victuals
for the use of the remaining inhabi
tants by the retreating Russian hosts,
be eased by the relief work of the
United States of America which is or
ganized on so great a scalo. The Im
perial government has particularly
offered all guarantees consistent with
the requirements of war that the im
ported foodstuffs will only serve the
needs of the population of the terri
tory occupied. Accordingly the
American relief might have been re
leased, several months ago with the
same provisions as in northern France
had not the government of Great
Britain prevented its accomplishment
by clinging toit3 unfounded arid im-
practicable conditions. In this way it
has becomo practically impossible to
convey a considerable amount of
foodstuffs from America to Poland
by tho expiration of the term set as
the end of the relief work is October
I. Accordingly further negotiations
are dovoid of purpose.
"But on the other hand, thanks to
the agricultural character of the land
affected, the imperial government by
using the means available and every
effort possible in the occupied terri
tory, and owing to the favorable har
vest prospects, a relief action after
October 1, 191C, can apparently be dis
pensed with. The fact that the popu
lation of Poland and Lithuania will to
some extent suffer until the new crop
is lodged and later on will sometimes
have to put up with straightened cir
cumstances can therefore be not laid
to the blame of the imperial govern
ment, but to that of Great Britain."

are Inseparably linked with the devot
ed and untiring labor at home.
"This strength at home has sent an
ever fresh Inspiration to the armies
of the field. It has continually quick
ened our swords; has kindled Ger
many's enthusiasm and terrified the
enemy. My gratitude and that of the
fatherland are duo tho nation at home.
"But the strength and will of the
enemy are not yet broken. Wo must
continue tho severe struggle in order'
to secure the safety of our beloved
home land; to preserve the honor of

the German merchant submarine
Deutschland remained moored to her
pier at Locust Point this afternoon at
the conclusion of activities indicating
final preparations for her starting on
her return voyage to Germany.
No official reason could bo ascer
tained for tho delay but. it was as
sumed that the tide was not high at
its morning flood stage. This was due
to a strong adverse wind blowing
down the river and bay. Tho next
high tide occurs between 7 and 9

STEAMER FIGHTS
A SUBMARINE
Montreal, Quebec, Aug. 1. Tho
British steamer Clodmoore, just in
port from Genoa, Italy, had- a battlo
in the Mediterranean sea with a Ger
man cr Austrian submarine, her com
mander, Charles Hunter, reported to

The Clodmoore plainly showed tho
marks of the submarine's gunfire.
The steamship i8 armed with one
gun for defensive purposes and it waa
with this, her captain sad, that he
shelled the submarine when sho at
tacked and so seriously damaged her
that she drew off apparently in a
sinking condition.
The battlo lasted half an hour, ac
cording to Captain Hunter, but only
ono shell did serious damage to tho
Clodmoore. This pierced the vessel
near tho engineer's and mate's quar
tern. Several shells, howecver, drop

Greatly Pleases the Wom

MOUTHPIECE IN UTAH
Sutherland Makes the An
nouncement and Suffragists
of the Country Applaud.
New York, Aug. 1. Charles E.
Hughes today declared for an amend
ment to the federal constitution pro-'
viding for woman suffrage. Mr.
Hughes' views on the subject were
made public in a letter he has writ
ten to Senator Sutherland of Utah.
Laboring With Wilson.
Washington, Aug. 1. Soon after
the news that Charles E. Hughes, the
Republican presidential nominee, had
come out for a federal woman suf
frage amendment reached Washing
ton, Mrs. Carrie E. Chapman Catt,
president, and Mrs. Frank M. Roes
sing, vice president of the National
Woman's Suffrage Association, had a
long conference with President Wilson
and again urged him to change his
announced determination to leave tho
Issue to the states.
The engagement with the president
was made several days ago and the
women did not learn of Mr. Hughes'
announcement at New York until a
short time before they went to " (tie
White House.
When they came from the confer
ence they said the president never
had closed his mind against the ad
visability of supporting a suffrage
amendment and they expected the
president would make his position
clearer before the convention of the
National Woman's Suffrage Associa
tion at Atlantic City in September.
Both of the president's callers de-1
clared that It was by no means a
foregone conclusion that their assocla-1
tion would support Mr. Hughes and
that a campaign policy would bo de
cided on at Atlantic City. Mr. Hughes'
announcement was mentioned during
the White House conference.
Mrs. Catt said sho was not sur
prised at Mr. Hughes' action, because
he had told a delegation of suffrag
ists shortly after his nomination that
he would favor a federal amendment
muur in mo campaign, sue aaued,
however, that his pronouncement was
not expected so soon.
At the headquarters of the Con
gressional Union for Women Suffrage,
statements were issued congratulating
Mr. Hughes on his stand and predict
ing that the women voters of the west
would unite in his support.
Mr. Hughes was asked today for a
statement on the reception given him
last night when he delivered his
speech of acceptance. He said:
"To my mind it was a most gratify
ing reception. It seemed to me that
it showed most conclusively that
there was no misunderstanding with
respect to the issues of the campaign.
"Wo have not had an adequato ad
ministration and I think the Amer
ican people know It,"
Talks With Newspaper Men.
Mr. Hughes talked with fifty news
paper representatives at a luncheon
today. The national cominltteo had
provided a stenographer to make a
verbatim report of what Mr. Hughes
had to saj-. He Informed the editors,
however, that he wanted to talk freely-with
them and dismissed stenog
rapher. Mr. Hughes said that one of the
things ho had to live down was his
- - v. Vb UOlli JIUlMU.il, 111
his 190G campaign for governor of
New York, the nominee said, he was
regarded as "cold and aloof."
Ho said the same charge was made
during his socond campaign during
1906 and now that ho had come up
for tho third time ho had determined
to llvo down the reputation oncevfor
all.
Mr.' Hughes told the newspaper
men that in this respect ho wanted
their sympathy also.

ARE JNORMOUS I
Advance of Anglo-French on

350,000 Men by 1
Germans.
SLOW PROGRESS MADE H
French Do Biggest Part of Job
by Their Superior Fight
ing Skill.
Berlin, Aug. 1. By wireless to Say
ville, "according to a very cautious
valuatidn," says a statement issued to- IH
day by the 'Germany army headquar
ters, "tho total Anglo-French losses in jH
the Somme offensive will reach 350,
000 officers and men." IH
The statement says:
"A month has elapsed since the
great Anglo-French thrust called in IH
England's 'great sweep' during which,
according to the enemy's previous an-
nouncement, a decision had to be ob
tained under all circumstances.
"On a 28 kilometer (17 miles) front j
the enemy advanced four kilometers
(four and a half miles) in the aver
age but, but after his experiences of
Julyy 20, 22, 24 and 26 he will not JM
affirm that the enemy line has even
been shaken at any time.
"This "success cost the 'British at
least $30,000 men, according to a
very cautious valuation. For the '
French lossea there are no accurate IH
foundations, but since the French had
to do the biggest part of the job and
even taking into consideration their
superior fighting skill, the total
enemy losses will reach 350,000. The
German losses can not be compared
to these figures.
"As a result of the slow progress IH
made by the offensive, we have had
time to construct new fortifications
behind our lines identical to those .
lost In order to illustrate the facts
mentioned in tho foregoing, it Is stat-
ed that in the first month of fighting i
at Verdun we gained double the
amount of territory while the casual- jH
ties were no larger than, we could af-ford."
