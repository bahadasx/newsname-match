aaiiH3S?j# RUSS/AW
KOLOMEA
By FRANK H. SIMONDS.
Neariy two weeki ago I indicated the fashion in which the Russians
were stoadily drawing a net around the Galician city of Lemberg. At that
time I compared the situation to a wheo!, of which Lemberg was the hub,
the railroadl leading to the Russian linc-s the spokes and the Russian
front the tire. The recent Russian victorics, rcsulting in the capture of
Brody on the north, togothcr with the resumption of the Russian advance
on the south toward Stanislau, have modified the situation and brottght
new and more immediate danger to Lomberg.
A glance at the aceompanying sketch will indicate the present situa?
tion. The soiithorn Russian army. having taken Brody, is moving dowa
-he Brody-Lemberg railroad. Aa it stands it is not ow ftfty miles from
! miborg, and the lateat Russian ofBeial statements claim that the advance
is still going forward rapidly in the- direction of Kra&ne, whk'h ll thirty
two miles east of Lemherg and not quite twenty milot from the present
Ruuian front west of Brody.
Bot this advance from Krasne carrio-; a very grave menare to the
Au.-dro-Cerman army, stiil standing almost in the same position that it
beld ffhen the Ruasian driva bagan two monthi ago?that is, ten miles west
of Tarnopol and on the high ground on the west bank of the Strypa River.
Already the Roaaian army which took Brody is nearer Lemborg than
the Atistrian army on the Strypa?the Ru,sians being fifty miles away?
the Austrians at least eighty.
It the Russians ndvaneing from Brody get to Kra.sne then they will
rtit the line of retreat of the Atistrian army from the Strypa along the
I.omberg-Krasne-Tarnopol railroad and actually intervene between it and
L?mbcrg. This army would then have to retreat by the loothweat, and
it w-.uid be a race beiwecn the Roaaian army advancing from Brody and
tha Anatrian army rotroatim: from 'he Screth, with Lemborg as the goal.
Meantime the Russian army advancing from Kolomea in the aooth
and approaching Stanisiati is carrying exactly the same menace. It ifl
not yet nearer U-mhorg than the Anatrian army along the Strypa, but it
will be if it geta beyond Stanislau. And already it is further west than
the Strypa army and threatening Ita souihern tlank as the army coming
from Brody threatens its northern flank.
In the next few daya, taerefore, it
: taian adranee from tfp> Ij
from Kolomea is not checked, the Au
trian army of the Strypa will have to

I The naxl t'""d defensive line for the
Aaatro?Genaan forces is just (n front

Thousands of Recruits.
Transit companies and labor leaders in the present street
car strike are nearing a deadlock which may impose upon the
city the greatest transportation hardship it has ever expe
rienced.
Union officials, who already claim 4,000 strikerc in their
ranks, are determined to organize every surface, elevrted and
I subway line in the greater city. The officers of the transit com
! panies, threatened with strike and acti/ally suffering from it,
| are equally determined?for the good of the service, they say
?to fight that ultimatum to the last letter.
A ray of hope flashed on the situation last night when May
or Mitchel announced that a conference would be he!d at City
Hall this afternoon at which an effort would be made to com
pose the differences between the Tnird Avenue Railroad em
ployes, now striking almost to a man, and the company offi?
cials. Representativet of each side will meet the Mayor in
his office at one o'clock. ,v V
Thousands Trudge On.
Aside from this, the situation from the standpoint of the
city's travelling public appeared to be hopeless. Thousands
of working people and others who mu>t use the street's tran?
sit lines morning and evening or walk already have a foretaste
of what may bo visited upon them.
