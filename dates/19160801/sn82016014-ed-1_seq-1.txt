in Bitter Contest.
Voting for State, Congressional,
District, County, Township.
Kansas is today holding her fifth
state-wide prima., for the selection of
candidates for state, concessional,
district, county and township offices.
Voting Rtarted this morning in nearly
J. 500 wards and voting precincts, with
early returns indicating an unusually
light vote. Improved weather condi
tions gave hope for an increase in the
early estimate of the total vote of the
state. Returns from over the state,
however, indicate that even in the face
of heated lo al contests in many coun
ties the vote of the state may not ex
ceed 150,000 of a possible 900.000.
As a result of today's primaries, the
state house was today almost deserted.
Numerous state officials, clerks and
department heads left Monday and
Monday niKht for their home towns,
and today the stenographers are in
charge of affairs in most state offices.
Keturns tonight will come to To
peka slowly. Interest in local fights
will in many localities result in a first
count of the county vote. Then, when
convenient, the state votes will be
chalked up and the returns sent to
Topeka. Except in cases of a land
slide to individual candidates, results
from several state contests may be in
doubt until some time Wednesday.
Returns Will Be Slow.
Persons interested in the state-wide
returns must wait patiently while the
single election board marks up the
tally sheets and sends In the returns.
The same election board which will
today care for the voters, must tonight
count the votes, check up the returns
and file their report. Many of these
boards are composed of men and wo
men old in years and with defective
sight and hearing. When the state
legislature created the double election
board, it did not provide specifically
for operation of the revised election
system in the primaries. Under a rul
ine. of th. nttnrnev eeneral's office, the
double election board will work only
in November. Single boards must stay
on the Job until the finish in today's
primaries.
Early returns today indicated keen
Interest in fights in a number of dis
tricts. A heavy vote is expected in
the Sixth district as the result of the
long, bitter fight of Max Anderson and
Otis L. Benton for the Republican
congressional nomination. Similar
conditions exist in the Fourth district
where Clyde W. Miller, H. F. Martin
dale. H. J. Hodgson and W. H. Math
ews are fighting for the nomination.
Big Vote In Wyandotte.
A fight between U. S. Guyer and E.
C. Little, for the Second district nomi
nation, today brought out a big vote
in Wyandotte county. Both men live
In Kansas City, Kansas.
In Osage county, the fight to defeat
James Pringle for the senatorial nomi
nation is the chief matter of concern
and has aroused the voters to the
point of forgetting the heated weather
and going to the polls. Pringle v.-as
formerly speaker of the house.
The Wayman-Plumb senatorial
fight in Lyon, the Carnahan-Myers
contest in Clay, and the Carroll-Cotton
senatorial contest in Wabaunsee
county will aid in securing a heavy
vote in the respective counties. Except
in the home counties of the candidates,
there is little interest or concern in
the state contests. Wylie W. Cook, as
sistant state treasurer and candidate
for nomination for treasurer, left Mon
day night for his home in Kansas
City, Kan. Frank Organ, assistant
auditor and candidate for promotion,
has gone to his home in Howard,
while J. T. Botkin, secretary of state,
left Monday night for hig home In
Galena. Justice Silas Porter votes to

auditor, votes in Dodge City; Chief
Justice W. A. Johnston votes in Min
neapolis; Earl Akers, state treasurer.
votes in Stafford, while S. M. Brew
ster, attorney general, votes in Troy.
Cooler weather today promised to
aid in bringing out the voters. But
the decided lack of Interest in other
than local contests, is expected to in
jure a light vote. Even a personal ap
peal by Governor Capper has failed to
a ouse the voters. Political observers
predict that one-sixth of the voters
of the state will today express a pref
erence for state candidates. That
would mean a vote of 150.000.
ELECTION BULLETINS!
The good people of Topeka tonight
will not be disappointed in their cus
tomary sojourn for the election re
turns. As usual, the State Journal
will maintain service at the popular
Eighth and Kansas avenue corner.
Returns from every precinct in the
Mty will be posted in totals on a large
bulletin board to be erected in front
of the building on the Kansas avenue
side. The more important contests, as
well as state contests, will be bulle
lined here.
From an upstairs window, Charles
Crews, the man whose voice has pene
trated Kansas avenue from the State
Journal in years gone by, will yell re
turns in detail.
The polls close at 7 o'clock and the
State Journal corps will be turned
loose to gather returns shortly after.
It probably will be 8 o'clock before
figures of any consequence will be
avauaoie.

FIND CONSPIRACY?
Publishers Charge Plot by
Paper Manufacturers.
Editors Serve Notice of Real
War Federal Probe On.
BY ROBERT J. BENDER.
Washington, Aug. 1. Notice of a
real war on print paper manufacturers
was given by newspaper publishers of
the United States today at an open
hearing before the federal trade com
mission. The hearing is the first of
several to be held to determine if pos
sible the underlying causes and a
possible remedy for the tremendous
increases in the cost of print paper to
publishers.
Representatives of the American
Newspaper Publishers' association, the
National Editorial association, the
New Jersey Publishers' association,
the Pennsylvania State Editorial asso
ciation. Pennsylvania Publishers' asso
ciation, and the Newspaper Manufac
turers' association, were present.
Price Jumps 100 Per Cent.
That the American Newspaper Pub
lishers association, is preparing a
war chest" to fight the manufac
turers and is compiling data tending
to show that collusion ana conspiracy
exist among tne manuiaciurers iu
keep print paper prices up, was de
clared by Vice President F. P. Glass,
of the association, first speaker at the
hearing. Glass said general prices on
contracts have increased 25 to 30 per
cent and that publishers desiring ex
tra paper have been compelled to pay
as high as fifty to one hundred per
cent more.
"The situation lacing tne newspa
pers today is very threatening" said
ainM "We find many evidences on
the part of manufacturers of concerted
action. We are trying to gather facts
sustaining evidences of collusion and
conspiracy. We have not the legal
evidence today. We are morally cer
tain it exists. We expect to have the
proof within sixty days ana possiDiy
sooner.
Mills Making it ineaper.
"Certain mills," said Glass, "are
making paper cheaper than ever be
fore."
J. H. Zerbey, representing tne Na
tional Editorial association, gave the
first testimony to indicate collusion
between mill owners.
"T was cut off from my paper sup
ply after a minor infraction of rules,"
he said. 1 wrote iriirry or iurtj
manufacturers and brokers regarding
supplying me with paper. I received
three replies asking for specifications.
After furnishing these, one wrote back
he might take care of me for a little
while, and another said he'd tried to
trikt mv contract before and couldn't
and now he couldn't do anything for
me. All three asked me why I didn't
go back to my original dealer. . .
WILL BE HOT AGAIN
Slightly Cooler Weather Is Only Tem
porary, Says Weather Observer.
Cooler weather will be in order In
Kansas tonight but Wednesday will
see a return of the high temperatures,
according to the weather bureau. The
forecast calls for generally fair weath
er tonight and Wednesday with higher
temperatures In the western ana
northern parts of the state. No rain
fell in any part of the state last night
and no precipitation is in sight. The
minimum temperature this morning
was 74 degrees at 6:30 o'clock, but
after that the mercury did not rise
rapidly. The reading at 9 o'clock was
80 degrees, and S. D. Flora, local
weather observer, announced that the
mercury would not go above 90 de
grees today.
Hourly temperature readings fur
nished by the weather bureau:
7 o'clock 76
11 o'clock 82
8 o'clock 77
9 o'clock 78
10 o'clock 80
12 o'clock 84
1 o'clock 88
2 o'clock 91
Temperatures today averaged 4 de
grees above normal. The wind is
blowing at the rate of fifteen miles an
hour from the east. Tomorrow, ac
cording to the weather bureau, the
mercury will go to 96 or 98 degrees.
The highest temperature yesterday
waB 98 degrees at 4 o'clock. This was
1 degree below the high mark of Sun
day. A temperature of 90 degrees is
a welcome relief but it Is only tem
porary. Last night was only 2 de
grees cooler than the night before
but a good breeze all night made It
much more comfortable. The wind
continued this morning at the rate of
twelve miles an hour from the north
east. The Kaw river is stationary at a
stage of 5.3 feet. The highest tem
perature on record for this date is 100
degrees, established in 1890. The low
record, 66 degrees, occurred in 1898.
PUBLISHERS TESTIFY
Federal Inquiry Into Increased Cost
of Paper, in Session
Washington. Aug. 1. Newspaper
publishers and printers were given a
hearing today by the federal trade
commission on the scarcity and high
price of news print paper. Those who
appeared included John Clyde Oswald,
representing New York publishers; A.
Nevin, Pomeroy, Pa., superintendent
of state printing: J. H. Sorby of potts
ville. Pa., chairman of a committee
from the National Editorial issocla
tion; Robert L. McLean, spokesman of
Philadelphia publishers, and repre
sentatives of the Pittsburg Daily Pub
lishers' association. Paper manufac
turers will testify later.
An open hearing with the publish
ers had been arranged by the com
mission for two purposes; to get any
ideas publishers may have as to the
cause and justice of tne increased
price of paper. To show the pub
lishers what the commission has been
able to learn of the facts behind the
price boost.
For two months the commission has
had fifteen accountants at work on
the paper manufacturing plants of the
country, going over the books to de
termine, if possible, what has made
print paper suddenly more expensive.
It has already been determined that
the demand for paper has shown a
tremendous increase The hearing to
morrow will develop the first re-port
of the commission. The completion
of its investigation together with its
formal report, is expected by Octo
ber 1.
HUGHES TO OPEN
BIG CAMPAIGN IN
TOPEKA SEPT. 2
Presidential Nominee Will De
liver a Speech Here.
Plans for the Largest Political
Meeting in Years.
ON THE STATE HOUSE GROUNDS
Open Air Celebration if Weath
er Will Permit.
Judge May Visit All Cities In
vaded by Wilson.
Charles Evans Hughes, Republican
nominee for president, will open the
campaign in Kansas with an hour's
speech in Topeka Saturday afternoon,
September 2. He will deliver one and
possibly two speeches In this state. It
is possible he may make a speech in
Salina. The Topeka meeting, how
ever, will be the official opening or
the campaign and plans are being laid
for one of the biggest political meet
ings held in Kansas in years.
Notice of the Hughes meeting was
sent to Topeka today, in a telegram bj
Fred E. Stanley, Republican national
committeeman, to Charles Sessions,
secretary to Governor Capper and pro
visional chairman of the state com
mittee. Judge Hughes will come to
Topeka on a special train over the
Union Pacific. He will speak here at
3 o'clock in the afternoon.
It is probable the Hughes meeting
will be held on the state house
grounds, unless weather conditions re
quire an indoor meeting. In that event
the meeting will be held in the audi
torium. Hundreds of Kansas Repub
licans are expected in Topeka for the
meeting and an outdoor meeting will
he held if possible. With a Saturday
date, it is believed the Hughes meeting
will draw heavily from over the state.
Will Come on a Special.
Governor Capper will probably in
troduce Judge Hughes. The former
United States supreme court justice
will come to Topeka on a special train
from Denver, where he speaks the
night of September 1. In event the
Salina meeting is arranged, he
Hughes special will stop in Salina -or
thirty or forty minutes. A number of
Kansas politicians will meet the
Hughes special in Salina if a meeting
be arranged for that point. Other
wise, it is probable that a delegation
will meet the presidential nominee In
Denver.
"The Hughes meeting will be the of
ficial opening of the campaign in
Kansas," said Sessions today. "We are
planning one of the biggest meetings
held in Kansas in years and I believe
Republicans from every section of the
state will be here. Since the meeting
is arranged for Saturday, there is no
doubt that hundreds of farmers and
business men will drive to Topeka
from surrounding counties."
Will Be Here an Hour.
Special trains may be arranged for
the Hughes meeting. Detailed plans
concerning the special train service
will be worked out later.
Judge Hughes will spend an hour
in Topeka. His train will leave at 4
o'clock for Kansas City, where the
presidential nominee will speak in the
evening. The big western trip which
includes Topeka on the itinerary will
be Judge Hughes's first invasion of the
west in the presidential campaign. It
will be his second speech in Topeka
and the only speech which he will de
liver in Kansas this year, unless the
Salina meeting be arranged in con-
Junction with the jump from Denver
to Topeka.
It is probable that the Hughes west
crn itinerary will include nearly all of
the cities visited by President Wilson
in February. Both Topeka and Kan
sas City were visited by the president
during his recent western tour

Bare Labor Conspiracy.
Explosion Throws Editor and
Family From Their Beds.
Chicago, Aug. 1. Two bombs, be
lieved to have been made of dynamite,
were exploded this morning under the
building of the Jewish Daily Fress,
whose publisher, A. M. Lieblingr, was
a witness for the state in the recent
trial of & score of labor leaders
charged with conspiracy here.
At the time of the trial Mr. Lieb
ling told Assistant State Attorney Ra

man national committee for honorable
peace held meetings throughout Ger

WHY GERMANY DELAYS
Old Treaty with Italy Considered of
Great Value to Teutons.
Paris, Aug. 1. CTie only reason
which has so far prevented Germany
from declaring war on Italy, says the
Petit Parisien, is a commercial treaty
signed by the two countries in 1891
and renewed in 1904. .
This treaty subordinated Italy to
Germany economically, according to
the paper, and it was considered of
great importance by Germany.
The Parisien says that it under
stands Italy has now denounced this
treaty and thereby left the way clear
for a declaration of hostilities.
Osteopaths In Kansas City.
Kansas City, Aug. 1. With section

DRIEST JULY IN TOPEKA
Only 7 Per Cent of Normal Rainfall
Fell During the Month.
July. 1916, was the driest and one of
the most uncomrortamy warm sum
mer months Topeka has experienced
in the past thirty years, according to
the detailed summary issued this
morning by the local weather bureau
office.
Temperatures of 90 degrees or high
er occurred on twenty-five days of the
rr.onth with the least wind movement
in the past seventeen years, and there
were twenty-one nights when the
mercury failed to go below 70 degrees.
On the coolest day of the month the
temperature reached SS degrees.
Only two months on record. July,
1901. and August. 1913. have had i
higher average temperatures and each
of them was favored with a better
wind movement.
The variation in temperature from
day to day was the least of any month
on the local record and despite the
continuous hot weather no records
were broken by high temperatures of
any individual day . or night. The
highest temperature recorded was 99
degrees on the 16th and the lowest
Gl degrees on the 21st.
- The total rainfall, 0.32 of an inch,
was scarcely enough to make one good
shower had it all fallen the same day
and was only 7 per cent of the month's
formal. The previous driest July on
record had three times as much rain
as this month.
- There were more clear days and a
higher percentage of sunshine than in
any ether July on record.
It was a favorable month for har-
1 vesting and threshing wheat and oats.
making nay ana aiggmg potatoes dui
very unfavorable for corn, which was
beginning to tassel and had reached
the most critical period of its growth
just as the dry weather was beginning
to be felt. It is estimated that even
should rains come with the first 'of
August the corn crop of the county
would be damaged almost tu per cent.
Gardens and pastures were generally
dried up by the close of the month.
LOOKS LIKE BIG
VOTE IN TOPEKA
ANDJHAWNEE
Morning Balloting Largest in
Years In This City.
Registration, Too, Is Greatest
in History Here.
NO TROUBLE AT THE POLLS
City Clerk Has Sot Heard of a
Single Challenge.
Count Will Be Slow Likewise
Returns Tonight.
. Today's vote will reach a greater
total than in any previous primary in
Topeka and Shawnee county if there
is no slackening in the vote later in
the day. Judges and clerks over the
city said today that the number of
votes cast during the morning hours
was greater than at any previous pri
mary election at which they had
served.
The registration in Topeka is
greater than ever before, the tempera
ture ladled out by the weather de
partment extends an invitation to
women to get out of doors, and the
county candidates are using every fa
cility for getting voters to the polls.
Everything points to an exceptionally
heavy vote. The total registration in
Topeka is 23,004.
The polls opened over the city at 6
o'cLock this morning and will remain
open until 7 o'clock this evening. Un
der this arrangement voters who work
in the shops and elsewhere have an
opportunity to cast their ballots before
or after their day's work, without tak
ing time off.
In the country the polls did not open
until 7 o'clock and they will close at
6 o'clock, an hour earlier than in the
city. There was no rain in Shawnee
county during the night to cheer the
farmers but the cooler weather today
is promising and candidates believe it
will have a tendency to increase the
rural vote.
So far nothing has occurred to mar
the election In Topeka. There has
been no trouble at any of the polls and
no word has been received at the of
fice of the city clerk, of even a single
challenge. There was much early Vot.
ing. Men voted on their- way to work
and many women, fearing the cool
wind would not last, dressed early and
cast their ballots with their husbands.
In the second precinct of the Sixth
ward 74 ballots had been cast at 8
o'clock, -
A House Divided. .
A peculiar situation developed early
today in the south part of the city.
Mr. and Mrs. P. O. Devon live at 1423
Van Bure The line dividing the sec
ond precinct of the Third ward from
the second precinct of the Fifth ward
passes through their house. Mrs. De
von and her husband registered at dif
ferent times and Mrs. Devon registered
from the second of the Third -vhile
Mr. Devon registered from the second
of the Fifth. Today they thought they
would vote together and the targie
was discovered. One of them called
Commissioner W. L. Porter by tele
phone and the matter was looked up
in the office of the city clerk. All
that was necessary was for the hus
band to go to another polling place
and east his vote.
Because of the numerous candidates
on the Republican ticket, it Is expected
that the counting tonight will be slow
and that complete returns will be late.
County candidates began making the
rounds of the polls as soon as they
opened this morning. One automobile
has followed another from one poll
ing place to another all day. Some of
the candidates have gone out into the
country to see that their farmer
friends' do not fall to cast their bal
lots. With all the interest the flock of
county candidates has stirred up there
is little election talk heard on the
streets today except around the polls.
He Talked Too Much.
If you are a Democrat, and so an
nounce to the election Judges, but ask
for a Republican ballot, the judges can
not refuse it that is, unless someone
challenges your vote. But if you state
flat-footedly that you do not intend to
support the Republican candidates
nominated, you are not entitled lo a
Republican primary ballot.
That question came up In one city
precinct today and was referred lo Os
car Swayze, county clerk. Home
voter told the judges he was a Demo
crat, wanted a Republican ballot and
said he wouldn't support the Republi
can candidates nominated. He was
refused a Republican Dallot.
"But," said Swayze. "if he had
merely announced that he was a Dem
ocrat but wanted to vote a Republi
can primary ballot the judges would
nave naa no right to refuse him."

BY PERRY ARNOLD.
New York, Aug. 1. Charles Evans
Hughes's "keynote" for the coming
campaign pleased all Republicans to
day. Party chiefs who assembled to
hear the former Justice formally ac
cept the nomination last night, spent
today in praising the striking sen
tences with which the candidate out
lined the issues on which the G. O.
P. is to start eviction proceedinga
against Woodrow Wilson and the
Democratic majority in the senate and
house.
The fact that 4,000 men and women
sat for nearly three hours in swel
tering, sizzling heat to hear the nomi
nee break another one of his famous
silences in the meeting at Carnegie
hall was looked upon by Republican
today as auguring well for success in
November. Moreover, the same sticky,
sweating auditors had enough enthu
ai asm left at the end of that session
in the close air of the hall to cheer
Hughes vociferously. They would
have liked to have heard something
from Colonel Roosevelt, but the for
mer Moose, playing second fiddle" at .
a political gathering for the first time
in a great many years, hustled out of
the hall.
An Effective Campaigner.
Hughes's speech pleased today be
cause in the view of his friends he
supported hia harmony plea with a
selection of the issues for the cam
paign which combine views of Repub
lican stand patters. Republican liberals
and Progressives. The "old liners"
were pleased with a ringing protection
declaration on the tariff: the liberals
with the labor, conservation and ad
ministrative efficiency sections, in his
upbraiding of the Wilson administra
tion, and the Bull Moosers with the
"Americanism" creed, the prepared
ness platform and the Mexican discus,
sion.
Republicans and Democrats alike
today were convinced that Hughes's
principal issue In his fight against
Wilson will be the Mexican situation.
In Governor Campaign 8 Years Ago.
The second line offensive will be
bombardment along the lines of "ade
Cuate" preparedness and the tariff.
Nearly eight years ago, Hughes ac
cepted the gubernatorial nomination
In Madison Square Qarden. At that
time and in the campaign which fol
lowed he was adjudged one of the best
campaigners New York had ever seen.
Considerably grayer of beard and
more bald last night than in that other
night of acceptance, Hughes exhibited
no diminution of vigor in his stump
ing ability, in the opinion of those
who knew him in other days.
On his transcontinental trip starting
Saturday, his supporters expect him to
give the country a sample of the sort
of campaigning that made him famous
in the gubernatorial race.
Mr. Hughes's Speech.
The text of Mr. Hughes's speech fol
lows in full:
Senator Harding. Members of the
Notification Committee and Fellow
Citizens: .
This occasion is more than a mm
ceremony of notification. We are not
here to indulge in formal expressions.
We come to state In a plain and direct
manner our faith, our purpose and our
pledge. This representative gathering
is a happy augury. It means the
strength of re-union. It means thai
the party of Linooln is restored, alert,
effective. It means the unity of a
common perception of paramount na
tional needs. It means that we are
neither deceived nor benumbed by ab
normal conditions. We know that we
are in a critical period, perhaps more
critical than any period since the Civil
war. We need a dominant sense of
national unity; the exercise of our best
constructive powers: the vigor and re
sourcefulness of a quickened America.
We desire that the Republican party
as a great liberal party shall be the
agency of national achievement, the
organ of the effective expression of
dominant Americanism. What do 1
mean by that? 1 mean America oon
scious of power, awake to obligation,
erect in self respect, prepared for
every emergency, devoted to the ideals
of peace. Instinct with the spirit of hu
ms n brotherhood, safeguarding both
individual opportunity and the public
interest, maintaining a well-ordered
constitutional system adapted to local
