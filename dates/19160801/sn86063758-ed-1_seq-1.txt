SO SPECIAL PROTECTION
FOR GERMAN SUBMARIM
Deutschland Must Take Same Chances
as Ordinary Merchantman, State
Department Roles.
Wat linTton, July 2$.?Special protection
for the German merchant submarine
Duetschland when she starts
out of American territorial waters
was asked of the American government
late today vith the intimation
that the boat would leave Baltimore
some time tomorrow. Alter conierences
by state, treasury and naval department
officials, it was ruled that no
extraordinary precautions could be
ordered, because the United States
views the Deutschland as an ordinary
merchantman.
It is understood that the application
for protection was made through
the collector of customs at Baltimore
and'that Capt. Koenig. the submarine
: commander, desired a coast guard
^cutter or naval vessel to escort him
down Chesapeake bay and - to the
three mile limit Unless steps are
1 "* x~ ? ~ A ati.Km orir)D
tSKGn to preveui, n,, wc .-mum ... iUv,
probably will be followed out by a
I fleet of small craft carrying newspaper
correspondents, photographers
and sightseers. It is said, too, that
the Germans fear some British merchant
ship, might go to sea in the
wake of the Deutschland, advertising
her presence to the* allied cruisers
waiting off the Vinginia capes or even
attempting to ram her as soon a3 she
left American territorial waters.
Officials of the state department
beldi that whil? American neutrality
'must be fully safeguarded, it would
be a bad precedent for the governfent
to convoy or accord any other
unusual attention to a vessel which
can be rated only as a merchantman.
Precautions already have been
taken to see that the submarine* is
not molested within the three mile
limit. Since the reported incursion of
a British cruiser in the Virginia
capes last week, the armoured cruiser
North Carolina and three destroyers
have been patrolling off Cape Henry.
PREPARES TO LEAYE. '
Submarine Expected to Start on Her
Perilous Yoyage.
Baltimore; July 21*.?'The Gerirnn
submarine sea freighter, DeutschlanJ,
which; arrived at thfs- port' from Germany
three weeks ago tomorrow night
with- a cargo of dyestuffs, lay' snuggled
in her barricaded berth at Locust
Point tonight ready .to start on her
perilous homeward voyage. The tug
Thomas F. Timmins, which met the
Deutschland at the Virginia -capes and
convoyed her to Baltimore, was close
by with steam up.
Officials of the Eastern Forwarding
company, the submarine agents, refused
to comment on the Washington
dispatch sent out today concerning the
probability of her sailing tomorrow.
That they are concerned about the
boat's safety during her run down
Chesapeake bay seemed to be indicated
in 3 report, regarded as reliable,
that it is planned to have a second
tug accompany the submarine and
the Timmins as far as the capes to
guard against the possibility of "accidents"
en route.
One of the Deutschb.nd's navigating
officers and several of the crew
were on shore leave tonight with orders
it was said, to return aboard
ship by m^niafht.

THE GOOD EFFECTS
5 OF DRAGGING THE ROAD!

e To drag the roads while it con

f far as helping travel over the road
1 is- concerned but let us look at th
road from another angle. Suppos
s the roads are not dragged then th
j ruts will grow deeper and deeper, th
s ! water stands in them so that grea
mud holes are formed in place
. which soon become almost if not quit
iL ^aesable. In the meantime the wa
ter, by standing in the road throug'
want of proper drainage begins t
stretch out into hundreds of yard
and then into miles of muddy roads.

A LINE FRO>T FLORIDA.
After living in Jacksonville, Fla.,
for three months, i feel I am getting
r a little acclimated. I find the sun
i pretty warm during the day and find
- the nights pleasant and delightful,
t much to my surprise. There seems
11 to be something in the atmosphere
1 tfoat makes you sleep like a baby. I
- was discussing it with. Bro. W. H. Hili
ler, our pastor here, and he remarkea,
3 ho was of a nervous temperament and
- could sleep so well in this climate. We
are near the ocean and St Johns
- River where we get the breeze from.
r It haa been very dry down here. Tie
rains have now commenced and we
have showers most every day. This
sandy land, if properly cultivated and
? fertilized, produces well.
You will find citizens in this city,
- from every state in the 'United States,
o with usual quota of Chinamen, Greeks,
s Italians, etc.
This country seems well adapted to
? stock raising. Since the rainy seae
son, the forest is green with luxurious
e grass and the foliage in the swamps,
t abundant, affording pasture for thou
s sands of cattle and sheep, etc. I was
e talking with a man who had seven or
- eight hundred cattle in Marion counb.
ty, cattle grazing in an open range of
o many thousand acres of land not fena
ced. He said he had branded about
eighty calves recently. I presume the
g cattle is only salted occasionally and
a that is about all expense there is with
p. them. Just think during oold winter
b months our cows, many of them, hud-1
- lie on the sunny side of barns or some
0 protection from north winds, with an
a occasional basket of shucfcs, while in (
r Florida they have thousands of acres i
g of grazing all winter, using wild vio- j
a lets of dessert. The Armour Co. is j
e building a packing plant in this city
which will be a great help to stock |
raising. They can find a market for ;
all of their good stock and ought to
1 get good prices, as steak is retailing
a
j here at 25 cents a pound. (
t j This is a prosperous state as are all
| of our Southern states and in time ,
I will be thickly settled and lands very!
i.
j valuable. I saw oranges on trees'
yesterday between Jacksonville rind
e i Pablo Beach. Out in pine land secx
tion, the trees looked well. They of
ccurse were hanging on from, last sea-;
son's crop. [ have seen some fine
^ corn growing around here. There are
>>' a good many vegetables, melons,
A i . " . . .
u etc., grown also, it seems ny expen-.
; ment. It is found some sections grow
i-j f;ner Irish potatoes tban others, also
y | some better adapted to growtH of
.t j fruits, vegetables, melons, etc. . j
d This city is ljke many others. It'
needs a deligicus revival by Billy!
t Sunday or some one else. Theatres
h and moving pictures run in full blast j
on Sunday, and also excursionsup and
d down the St.1 Johns River. ,The
e beaches are near and railroad fare to j
\ them is moderate. Thousands of the j
s ^ working- class go and many others. I j
s ' notice a rule among the business
- [ houses, they give Thursday after- \
0 noon as holiday and all close up and
1 ' suspend business, which is a great re:
2 lief to those who work in offices and)
i j stores these long hot days, so man} j
r of them being ladies.
' My native state, South Carolina, is,
f ;
) j nevertheless, one of the best on the
:i n:,5p. and for twilight scenes is hard
i i to surpass. We have the rustling of
i the barley, the turtle dove cooing
t mournfully for his mate, the song of
i j the milk maid, the old fashioned
f | partridge whistle, "Bob-white," com
1 ing across the dew kissed meadows,
