ADRENALIN IS EFFECTIVE
Comparatively Old Remedy
Proves Worth in Treatment
of Infantile Scourge.
NEW YORK, Aug. I. First
proof of the success of the new
adrenalin treatment of the new
paralysis came today, when a baby
boy was discharged from the
Throat, Nose, and Lung Hospital
cured, after a course of the treat
ment.
Thirty more baby patients yho
were treated with adrenalin after
developing the infant scoruge, are
ready to be discharged, it was
stated. All have had the ultra
spinal injections, of the drug, as
suggested by the Rockefeller In
stitute.
The Willard Parker Hospital re
ported success today in its serum
treatment.
Both the adrenalin and serum
treatments will be laid before the
conference of prominent scientists
Thursday.
150 NEW CASES.
There were 150 new caeea reported
today, against, 133 yesterday. The
deathi of the past twenty-four hours,
however, set a new record 67.
Yesterday the mortality was only 35.
The total of cases since outbreak of
the epidemic has now reached 4,123;
wtn 8S deaths.
Health Commissioner Emerson
stated this afternoon that there were
Approximately 1,600 children now
ready to leave hospitals, having; re
covered from the disease. These re
present 80 per cent of victims at
tacked. The mortality has generally
hovered around 20 per cent.
Of the 80 per .cent who recover.
Emerson estimated that nearly one
half are crippled permanently. To
save the other half from twisted or
wasted muscles careful courses of ex
ercise and special apparatus Is needed,
The epidemic here has stricken so
many children that the city cannot
supply enough of this apparatus.
Fund Ib Started.
A call for funds with which to aid
the children of poor parents who
might be saved from permanent dls
buttles If they had apparatus, was
Issued today.
It. A. Harowits, millionaire, head of
a oonstructlon company, started oft
the subscription lists with a S,000
oontriouuon.
Adrenalin Is a comparatively old
remedy, having been In use generally
for about ten years. It Is a com
pound made from the kidneys of
animals and has been used chiefly
for the relief of hemorrhages and as
a heart stimulant.
Dr. W. C. Fowler, o f the District
Health Department, said today ho
knew but little of Is as a relief for
Infantile paralysis. "It Is In the ex
perimental stage so far as Its appll-
cation to this disease Is concerned."
he said, "and we know but little of
It here except what we have read.
In the past It has been used as a
heart stimulant and for the relief
of hemorrhages, but as a spinal In
jection, I think very few have used
Dr. William C. Rucker. of the
Public Health Sorvice, said: "Wo
don't know anything about adrenalin
as a means of treating Infantile
paralysis ecept what we have re
cently read in the medical Journals.
It Is an old remedy, of course, and
has been used for a number of
years In the treatment of 'hem
orrhages and for the purpose of
stimulating the heart action."
Won't Accept Terms
For Polish Relief
Germany Refuses to Agree to
British Proposals, Claiming
Impracticability.
Germany has refused to agree to
England's terms for Polish relief. The
answer to England and to the circular
note of the State Department of July 7,
expressing hope for a relief agreement,
was cabled from Berlin by Ambassador
Gerard and given out by the State
Department today.
Oermany places the blame for food
scarcity In Poland on the Russian
. army, declaring it destroyed or confla
cated tall foodstuff In Its retreat.
The note said the German govern-)
ment had offered all guarantees regard
ing Polish relief which were consistent
with requirements or war, and that It li

was reaulred several months ago as
was in northern France. The Brltifh

RUSS PRESS ADVANCE
ACROSS STOCKHOP
PETROQRAD, Aug. l.-Floodod fields,
mushy swamps and barbed wire entan
glements partly submerged have fallod
to stop the Russian advance across the
Btockhod river north of Kovel. German
positions which the Teuton commanders
have spent months In perfecting are
succumbing dally to Russian assaults.
The cnvelonlnr movummt .rmiml tra

General SakharofTs division Is forcing

estimate the Teutonic forces must retire

Judging from battle-front dispatches

limited public discussion of the peuci'

The honorable peace movement was m
augurated by the Kaiser to unify the

Cabinet Derides, Hughes Speech;
Keynote Welcomed By Republicans
CABINET SAYS HUGHES
FAILED TO MAKE
OUT CASE
Criticism of Mexico and Other
Administration Policies De
clared Ineffective.
OFFERED NO SUBSTITUTES
President Expected to Reply to
Republican Candidate in His
Speech of Acceptance.
Thp speech of former Justice Charles
Evans Hughes In New York last night,
accepting the Republican nomination
for the Presidency, formed the princi
pal topic of conversation at today's
meeting of the Cabinet.
Tho political advisers of tho President
in that body professed to bellevo that
the speech had done the Republican
candidate more harm than good. In that
It failed to be specific.
What the President himself thinks of
the speech Is not known. The Whlto
House preserved a conspicuous silence
on the subject, although the suggestion
was thrown out at the Executive offices
that on the occasion of the President's
epeech accepting tho Democratic nomi
nation, Mr. Wilson will not spare words
In demanding from his opponent a plain
recital of what Mr. Hughes would have
done In handling the various matters
for which tho Democratic Administra
tion Is criticised.
"Flat," Says Tumulty.
Seoretarv to the President Tumulty,
who had nerhans the best opportunity
before the Cabinet meeting to learn the
President's view of the speech, declared
It as his. Mr. Tumulty's, perxonal opin
ion, that the address was "Hat and In
effective." The President's) advisers generally
were not nlow In Interpreting the
sunch as a forecast tbat the lteDUhll
cans will make .Mexico the principal
Issue In the forthcoming campaign.
The former Justice's references to
the Mexican nolicv of the Administra
tion wcro studied carefully, and the
opinion was expressed that bv falling
to state what he would hae done, and
would now do. with resnrd to Mexico.

foiled to mako out a cane.
Views of Cabinet.
What the Cabinet members were will
ing to say for publication was as fol
lows: Attorney General Gregory Justice
Hughes falls to make Mexico an Issue
by falling to sny what he would hae
done In the snmo circumstances. This
the voters have a right to demand.
They havo a right to know from Mr.
Hughes whether ho would have recog
nized Huorta; whether he would have
Intervened in Mexico; whether ho would
Intervene now.
Secretary of Interior Lane-The
speech? Oh, It was fine very satis
factory. Postmaster General Burleson It was
worse thun pussy-footing. It was a
complete Iny-down. You can say for
me that Justice Hughes' speech was
tine from a Democratic standpoint. The
wotcrs of tho country nro tired of glit
tering generalities. They expect thoso
who criticise to say what they would do
In the same place, nnd this Mr. Hughes
falls conspicuously In- doing.
Secretary of War Baker I haven't
had time to read It. I couldn't wake up
at midnight to get It and begin read
ing It.
Acting Secretary of State Polk I've
been too busy to read it.
Secretary of Agriculture Houston I

Zeppelin Raider
Bagged, Say British
One Seen to Drop After Fight
With English Aircraft and
Guns.
LONDON, Aug. 1. Probably one of
the Zeppelins engaged In the raid on
eastern counties was bagged, the war
office announced today.
The raider was engaged by British
aircraft and bombarded by anti-aircraft
guns.
Later It was seen to drop to a low
altitude and disappear In the mist off
shore.
The number of dirigibles engaged In
the raid was not announced. A num
ber of explosive bombs were dropped In
a score or more of places and the Zep
pelins apparently cruised over half a
dozen or more counties, dropping bombs
at several places of no military Impor
tance, "The Zeppelins Hew at a great
height," the war office declared, "and
It was extremely difficult to determine
their, exact number, but there were at
least six. The bombs which they drop
ped fell In thinly Inhabited districts."
Late this evening the war office an
nounced there were no casualties from
the air raid.
Judge Clarke Assumes
Post on Supreme Bench
John H. Clarke was sworn in today
as a Justice of the Supremo Court.
Only Chief Justice White and the
clerk and marshal or the court were
present. Neither friends or the usual
curious crowd saw Clarke take the
oaths.
Justice White came from his Lake
Placid, N. Y summer home for the
ceremony.
FOUR ISSUES DEFINED
IN HUGHES' ADDRESS
4
Here are some of the views of Charles E. Hughes, expressed last
night In his speech of acceptance at Carnegie Hall:
MEXICO The nation has no policy of aggression toward Mexico.
We have no desire for any part of her territory. We wish her
to have peace. We shall have to adopt a new policy,
a policy of firmness and consistency, through which lone we
can promote an enduring friendship. We demand from Mexico
the protection of the lives and the property of our citizens and
tha security of our border from depredations.
EUROPEAN COMPLICATIONS It is a great mistake to say that
resoluteness in protecting American rights would have led to
war. Rather, in that course lay the best assurance of peace.
PREPAREDNESS Adequate preparedness is not militarism. It is
the essential assurance of security; it is a necessary safeguard
of peace. We demand adequate national defense;
adequate protection on both our Western and Eastern coasts.
I believe, further, that there should be not only a
reasonable increase in the regular army, but that the first citi
zen reserve, subject to call, should be enlisted as a Federal army
and trained under Federal authority.
SUFFRAGE Opposition may delay, but, in my judgment, cannot
defeat this movement. Nor can I see any advantages in the
delay which can possibly offset the disadvantages which are
necessarily incident to the. continued agitation. Facts should be
squarely met. If women are to have the vote, as I
believe they are, it seems to me entirely clear that in the in
terest of the public life of this country the contest should be
ended promptly. I favor the 'vote for women.

What the Politicians
Think of Speech
DEMOCRATS
Congressman Thaddeus II. Caraway,
Arkansas I think the Hughes speech
last night was as dry as dust Just a lot
of platitudes. There Is not a line In It
from the beginning to the end that
strikes fire.
Congressman Charles D. Carter, Okla
homa I wos not very much Impressed
with It. It wasn't as strong a speech as
l had expected Mr. Hughes to make.
Congressman Frank Clark, Florida
I think It Is about the weakest document
I ever saw coma from a big man. I think
It may be that people expected too mucn
from Mr. Hughes. 1 don't seo any of
the statement In the speech.
! Congressman Wlllism E. Cox, Indiana
I don't think he makes an issue at ail.
It looks to me like a man having the
ground cut from under htm, and that he
Is floundering In the dark trying to find
an Issue.
Congressman Clement C. Dickinson,
Mlssourl-I would think Mr. Hushes'
speech of last night would be disappoint
ing to the Republicans. It does not come
up to what the public has a right to ex
pect, and I don't believe he made a
successful attack on President Wilson.
Congressman A. W. Berkley of
Kentucky Considering that his sun
was rusty, his aim bad, and that he
had no ammunition, I suppose he did
the best he could. Surrounded by
these embarrassing conditions, all he
could do was to parade with the old
thing on his shoulder. It did not dis
turb the first line of Democratic
trtnehes. No wonder he kept It from
the public as lone as possible. His
greatest asset Is silence.
Congressman Joseph W. Byrnes of
Tennessee Shows how little can be
said In criticism of Wilson's Admin
istration. Although Judge Hughes
forcibly criticised the policies of the
President, it Is significant that he was
unable to do more than generalise.
It Is notable that he does not at
tempt to criticise any of the great
constructive measures that the Demo
cratic Administration has put upon
the statute books.
Congressman James B. Aswell of
Louisiana Going to cite the speech
in the Congressional Record for the
benefit of the Democratic campaign.
The Democrats are highly pleased.
Congress W. A. Ayres of Kansas
Following the trend of the Republican
leaders In the Senate and House, he
Criticised, but without stating what
he would do If placed under similar
conditions. He offered no construc
tive Ideas.
Congressman Michael E. Burke of
Wisconsin Judging from his remarks
on the situation. It s evident that he
has been dally reading Hearst's Dally
American.
Congressman Clement Brumbaugh of
Ohio Do not regard It as new infor
mation. Tho President should have no
trouble In answering.
Congressman Warren W. Bailey of
Pennsylvania Haa proposed no remedy.
What would you hive done, Mr.
HtigheaT
Congressman W. C. Adamson of Gtor
gla Everything In It that Is any good
Wilson has already accomplished, tho
rest Is all bosh.
Congressman J. W. Alexander of Mis
souri I think It carping criticism. He
haa offered no constructive policy. The
people want nn affirmative declaration,
something definite.
Congressman Alfred G. Allen of Ohio
There Is nothing to kick about In
the speech. It was exceedingly tame.
His hindsights are better than his fore
sights. If that Is the heat Hughes can
do. the country will go unanimously
tor Wilson.
REPUBLICANS
Senator Sterling-It Is an excellent
presentation of the shortcomings of the
Administration, especially with refer
ence to Its foreign policy, and tho
speech was replete with n strong, vig
orous American scntlmont and ought
,0..PP"l,. t0 every American dtUcn.
While tho speech necessarily couldn't
go into details relative to other great
national Issues, such as the tariff and
questions growing out of Industrial con
ditions, yet It. emphasized the principle
of protection to American industries
and American labor and showed what
would most likely hove happened had
It not been for the war. Tho speech
brought out the Idea that because of
the vacillating pol'cy of the Admlnlatra
t on we had been nearer war many
times than if there had been a firm
and consistent policy from tho begin
ning. Senator Weeks-I think It Is a com
prehensive statement of the ssus of
tho campaign presented In Mr. Hughes'
belt style.
Congressman McKlnley of Illinois I
was present at the notification, and was
very much pleased with Governor
Hughes' address. It was right to the
point, forceful, and candid.
Congressman La Follette of Washing
tonTo me Governor Hllohra' aruxu-h la
I highly satisfactory.
Senator Penrose I read Mr. Hughes'
speech carefully, it Is a strong, dig
nified, and complete arraignment of tho
weakness of the Administration. I
talked with Senators who heard the
peeoh, and they report that Hughes
made a great impression on the assem
bly. The speech generally outlines tho
campaign. Of course, he will develop
the Issues of the campaign as he pro
oeers In his tour through the West. He
has made a good beginning, and from
now the campaign will be continued
vigorously.
Congressman Fred H. Britten of 1111-nois-A
very definite statement, directly
opposed to the attitude of the Admlnls
,r'Mn durln the last three years,
wMfh hS. b,in vacllaUng and unre
L'ab.le' -J1?18 firmness with which he
deals with the foreign situation Indi
cates that he will become a strong
President, whose actions speak louder
than words.
Congressman I. 3. Brltt of North
Carollna-Maatorly. strong speech, defi
nite, and sound. Meets the Issue plain
ly and leaves no one In doubt as to
what the candidate stands for.
Congressman Bacharach of New
Jersey Mr. Hughes' speech of accept
ance was a most logical and forcible
presentation of the Important questions
confronting the American publlo today.
No one who heard him deliver It, xor
who has read It. can doubt for a moment
where ho stands on International
questions. He Is for America and the
perfection of American Industries and
American honor, first, last and forever.
He approves the platform of the Re
publican party and with such a plat
form and such a candidate It Is difficult
to see anything but the overwhelming
defeat, of the present Administration,
and tho universal retirement of the
Democratic party In the fall elections.
It Is my opinion that New Jersey, the
homo of President Wilson, will give Mr.
Hughes a handsome and substantial
majority.
Congressman Mann of Illinois, min

winner.

By PERRY ARNOLD.
NEW YORK. Aug. l.-Chnrles Evans
Hughes' "keynote" for the coming cam
paign pleasrd all Republican toduy.
Party chiefs who issemblcd to hear
the former justice formally accept the
nomination last night, were unanimous
today In praising tho striking sentences
with which the candidate outlined the
hsucs on which tho O. O. P. Is to start
eviction proceedings against Woodrow
Wilson and the. Democratic majority in
the Benate nnd House.
The fact tha't 4.000 men and women
sat for nearly three hours in swelter
ing, sizzling heat to hear thn nominee
break another one of his famous sil
ences In the meeting at Carnegie Hall,
was looked upon by Republicans today
as auguring well for success in Novem
ber. Moreover, the same sticky, sweating
auditors had enough enthusiasm bft at
the end of that session In the cIosh air
of the hall to cheer Hughes vocifer
ously.
They would have liked to have heard
something from Colonel Roosevelt, hut
the former Moose playing "second fid
dle" at a political gathering tor the
first time in a .great many years', hus
tled out of the hall.
Hughes' speech pleased today be
cause, In the view of his friends, he
supportod his harmony plea with a
selection of the issues for the cam
paign which combine views of Repub
lican stand-patters. Republican liber
als, and Progressives.
The "old-liners" were pleased with
a ringing protection declaration on
the tariff; the liberals with the labor,
conservation, and administrative effi
ciency sections In his upbraiding of
the Wilson Administration and the
Bull Moosers with the "Americanism"
creed, tho preparedness platform, and
tho Mexican discussion.
Mexico Chief Issue.
Republicans and Democrats alike
today were convinced that Hughes'
principal Issue In his fight against
Wilson will be the Mexican situation.
Tho second-line offensive will be bom
bardment along tho lines of "ade
quate" preparedness and the tariff.
Nearly eight years ago' Hughes ac
cepted the gubernatorial nomination
in Madison Square Garden. At thnt
time and in the campaign which fol
lowed, be was adjudged one of the
best campaigners New York had ever
seen.
Considerably grayer of beard and
more bald last night, than on that
other night of acceptance, Hughes ex
hibited no diminution of vigor In his
stamping ability, In the opinion of
those who knew him In other days.
Or. his transcontinental trip, start
ing Saturday, his supporters expect
him to give the country a sample of
campaigning that made him famous
In the gubernatorial race.

By CARL.D. GROAT.
BALTIMORE, Aug. 1. It lookr
ed along the Patapsco today as
though at last the German cargo
submarine Deutschland was ready
for her dash back to Germany.
A myriad of maneuvers, includ
ing a melodramatic search for
mines in the harbor, began around
the Deutschland pier shortly after
sunrise. The tug Timmins, mother
ship for the Deutschland, hooked
a drag onto Efco launch and drag
ged the harbor. Apparently the
spy obsession of the Deutschland
managers made them think that
some allied ship might have
spread mines on the Deutschland's
outward path.
But the only thing the drag
pulled up was a dozen hard shell
ed crabs and a ton of mud.
PILOT HELD. WAITING.
Police nnd Government boats wero
mjsterlously called Into service, and
they maneuvered around nervously for
an hrur. then llsuppearing, Further,
the Deutschland ordered Owen Coleman,
the pilot on the Inward trip, to be ready
to take her out. The tip wns that his
Instructions were to quit the harbor
before night.
Radio Inspector Cadmus said ho had
had no request from the Deutschland to
unseal her wireless a step necessary
before she can sail.
BREMEN NEVER LEFT
GERMANY, IS REPORT
Deutschland Not Awaiting Sister
Ship, Says Baltimore Sun.
BALTIMORE. Aug. l.-The Baltimore
Sun this morning prints the following:
The submarino Bremen, sister ship of
the Deutschland now hero, has never
sailed from her homo port.
This was learned by the Sun on un
impeachable authority from New York
last night. It accounts for the undis
turbed attitude of the local operators
of the Doutachland and likewise It dis
counts absolutely the reports of tho cap
ture of the Bremen by the British.
The Bremen was to havo sailed
"some time" after July 16 for Balti
more, and preparations were made hero
for providing a sufficiently deep berth
for her so in the event of submergence
tests like thoso held on the Deutsch
land last week, she could entirely sub
merge. This sailing time, ordinarily,
would have brought her to tho Capes
within the three weeks' time forecast
by the Sun two weeks ago.
Above all, the Bremen's safety has
never figured In any way with the
Deutschland's delay In sailing. The
cause has been a combination of cir
cumstances. Some other matters ac
count for the delay.
The Deutschland has been held. In
leash till these have been cleared
away. She Is ready to go at any min
ute primed fully as to engine ef
ficiency, fuel and provisions.
And the men are eager to go. There
Is naturally the concern felt that must
go with any Important enterprise and
which brave men manifest Insensibly.
But there Is no fear. There la tho
great clement of risk hovering on
the throe-mile llne-.at the capes; but
It serves only to tlngo the adventure

aging the get-away.
