NEW YORK, July 31. "It was
an admirable speech and I wish
o call attention to the following
points," said Colonel Roosevelt in -a
statement issued after the meet

The exposure of the folly and
worse than folly of Mr. Wilson's
Mexican policy and of the way in
which his policy has brought
humiliation to the United States
and disaster to Mexico itself. v
j "Moreover, I am glad of the
j straightforward manner in which AJr.
Hughes has shown the ridicule with
j which Mr. Wilson has characterized
this nation, by the manner in which
he allowed foreign powers to ; gain
the impression that, although he
used the strongest words in diplo
macy, they were not to be taken se
riously. That Fearless Eloquence
"Mr. Hughes also speaks in charac
teristically straightforward fashion of
the outrages committed on munitions
plants, and all men, whether citizens
of foreign nations or national citizens
of our land who in one shape or an
other has condoned these actions, can
understand that Mr. Hughes, if pres

ness and thoroughness that he used

NEW YORK, July 31. Presi
dent E. B. Thomas of the. Lehigh
Valley railroad, and President W.
G. Besler of the Central railroad
of New Jersey, probably will be
arrested on charges of man
slaughter in connection with the
explosion on Black Tom island
early Sunday morning, it was an
nounced late tonight by Frank
Hague, commissioner of public
safety of Jersey City. Three of
ficials of companies situated on
Black Tom island already are un
der arrest and a warrant is out
for a fourth. The same charge
has been preferred against all.
NEW YORK, July 31 Fire broke
out again today among the ruins left
by Sunday morning's explosion on
Black Tom island.
Half the fire department of Jersey
City, with fire boats from New York,
and New Jersey, fought the flames
which centered about the pier where
large quantities of shrapnel and
shells were stored. Shells exploded in
an almost continuous cannonade.
Many Investigations
Meanwhile with three officers
of corporations doing business on
the island under arrest and a
warrant out for a fourth, prepa
rations were under way at Jersey
City ' for a joint federal, state,
counxy and municipal investiga
tion to fix the blame for Sunday's
disaster, which killed at least
three men, injured scores and
caused approximately $50,000,030
property damage.
The theory that the fire which
caused the disaster was started on a
munitions barge tied at the island,
was eombatted today by Robert S.
Hudspeth, prosecutor for Hudson
county, and Theodore B. Johnson,
president of the Johnson Lichtrra.ee
company, owner of the barge.
Higher Ups Arrested
Johnson, who was arrested on a
warrant chiirtripe manslaughter
were Albert M. Hickman. Plack Tom
agent of the Lehigh Valley, and Alex
ander Davirson. superintendent of the
National Storage company, denied all
resnosibility for the explosion.
Prosecutor Hudspeth corroborated
Johnson's story. He said he had ob-tain-d
an affidavit from the com
mander of the tu? Geneva, which
gave a rompr-' iory or tl.e dis
aster. Big Loss to Entente
Mr. Hudspeth declared three-rifths
of the explosives of the entente al
lies passed through Jersey City. Late
in the dey a warrant was issued for
the Mrest on a charge of manslaugh
ter of Edmund I- MacKenzie of
Plainfield. N. J., president of the Na
tional Storage company whose plant
on Black Tom was destroyed.
Plate glass insurance underwriters
voted at a meetine here today to
waive all technicalities and to re
place at once all windows shattered
by the explosions. It is estimated that
the plate glass loss in Manhattan,
Brooklyn and New Jersey was M.OOD.

"Vera Cruz Was Act of War
The seizure of Vera Cruz, the
nominee said, "was war, of

"Later we retired from Vera

this noble warfare. Recently the
naked truth was admitted by a
