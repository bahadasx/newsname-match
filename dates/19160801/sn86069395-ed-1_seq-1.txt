We noticed 'a pretty girl on the

A Turkish army, estimated at 70,
000 strong, now is concentrated on
the Hungarian plains for the defense
of Hungary, says a dispatch to the

Lausanne, Switzerland.
A report from Mexico says Carran
za is preparing to turn over the pres
idency to Gen. Pablo Gonzales and
enter the field as a candidate for
election as president in a general elec
tion to be called.
Last week was one of reverses to
the Germans on both fronts that can
only be characterized as defeats. The
week ended with the capture of
Brody, in the East, and of Pozicres
and Longueval in the West.
The work of Tecruiting 500 men
for the Kentucky brigade will be be
gun today in many places. The Third
Regiment needs 135. The quarantine
has been lifted and the troops hope to
leave as soon as the companies are
recruited to peace strength.
Col. Jouett Henry has been granted
a furlough of ten days to attend the
Supreme Loage Knights of Pythias,
at Portland, Oregon, now in biennial
session there. He was elected a
'representative before he was called
.into active service.' The Regiment
will not be ready to move before his
return.
One of the first tasks assigned to
the tariff commission, to be created
by the pending revenue bill, may be
a tour of European countries, includ
ing the belligerents, to study the
effects of the -war on industrial and
trade relations of the United States,
and to report particularly information
which might aid in the adjustment of
tariff duties to meet conditions likely
to follow the restoration of peace'.
Gen. Carranzia has been informed
in a note handed to his ambassador
that the Washington government is
prepared to submit to a joint inter
national commission the task of seek
ing a solution of border problems.
The proposal of the de facto govern
ment for a commission is accepted,
however, with the suggestion that the
powers of the commissioners bo
enlarged beyond the limits proposed
in the Mexican note of July 12.
In a naval battle between several
German submarines and three Brit
ish patrol boats off the coast of Scot
land, Berlin reports the sinking of
ibne of the British ships. It adds that
the other jiatrol boat i are supposed to
have been sunk. London says that
in a raid by a German submarine on
a fleet of British fishing vessels, eight
of the vessels were sunk.
William Marshall Bullitt, chairman
of the General Committee, has an
nounced the appointment of two com
mitteemen a Democrat and a Re

slate, to act as escort for President
RVilsnn when he comes Sept. 4 to
formally accept the Lincoln Memorial
at Hodgenville, Ky. The two select
ed for Christian county are T. C.
Underwood and W. T. Fowler and
we challenge the state to produce a
better pair, intellectually, oratorically,
patriotically or pulchritudinously.

ALLIES IN HIGH FEATHER
Believe Their Prospects Arc
Brighter Than at Any Time
During the War.
London, July 31. The opening of
the present week and the beginning
of the third year of the war finds the
prospects of the entente allies per
haps brighter than in any previous
period of the war, according to views
held here, and the position of the cen
tral powersmorc discouraging Gen
eral Brussiloff's victories present the
German general staff with the imper
ative problem of how to reinforce the
Eastern front, since Gen. von Linsin-
gen, who was sent by Germany to
aid the shattered Austrians now has
been completely thrust back from the
Lutsk salient.
But the same problem is presented
on the Western front, where, says an
unofficial correspondent, "the cease
less battle seems steadily to gain in
intensity. Doubtless the constant ar
rival of fresh German troops and
guns," he adds, "has everything to
do with this result. The enemy shows
an increasing tendency to counter
a.ack." GERMAN COUNTERS FAIL.
These couitprjttacks have failed
to stem the steady entente allied ad
vance and although at the present
moment the fighting on the Somme is
mainly devoted to securing mastery
of small strategic positions, which will
be the keys to further progress, there
is yet no sign of the Germans making
any effective counter-oifensive.
The Russians' remarkable victories
reveal a most interesting situation.
The army of the German general
Count von Bothmer, holding the Stri-
pa near the Lemberg-Tarnopol rail
road, was a few weeks ago being
outflanked on the south by Gen.
Letchitzky's successful advance when
the Dniester floods prevented Letch
itzky's further progress. This en
abled Von Bothmer to hold on to the
threatened positions. Gen. Sakharoff
then devoted himself to enveloping
Von Bothmer's force or the north,
with what success is seen in his
double victory west of Lutsk and at
Brody,
VON BOTHMER MUST RETIRE.
Thus outflanked north and south it
is considered impossible that Count !
von Bothmer can longer delay extri-1
eating himself from his precarious1
position, even if he now can do so j
without serious losses. Tim Russians i
at Brody are at present nearer Lem -
barrr than Von Bothemer's which are
.,..cf,i urifii t nmKni-fr'o ,inw
and although the country between
Brody and Lemberg is very difficult,
it becomes a question whether the
evacuation of both Kovel and Lem
berg will not soon become necessary.

New York, July 31. Property loss

NOT DETERMINED.
The cause of the disaster has not
been determined.
Officials of the National Storage

harbor.
The barge, it was said, was there
without authority, either of the rail
road or the storage company. The
officials refused to disclose the name
of the independent towing company,
saying they were investigating "to
ascertain whether the barge purpose
ly had been set on fire as the result of
a plot."
STATEMENT BY LEHIGH VALLEY

A statement issued by the Lehigh
Valley railroad company, after a con
ference between heads of all depart
ments here in part said: '

pany and six piers owned by the stor
age company and leased to the Lehigh
Valley road, were .destroyed. Several
others of the brick warehouses, were
badly damaged and some minor dam
age was done to the Lehigh Valley
grain elevators. In addition, as far
as is known, eighty-five loaded cars
were destroyed.
"M. T. Henry, night general yard

! 40,000 TONS OF SUGAR LOST.
"Two long cuts of curs were suc
cessfully removed from the danger
zone before the rapidly spreading fire
i engulfed the balance. It has not. as

destroyed wore loaded with shrapnel,
which would not linve boen a source
