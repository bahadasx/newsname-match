Customs Inspector Called for Aid
From Carrsnzlstss During

SAN ANTONO, Texas, August 1.—
American troops are well able to hand
le the bandit situation themselves and
any call for assistance by Carranza
soldiers Is unwarranted.
This was General Funston's atti
tude today toward the action of Cus
toms Inspector Bean in summoning
a Carranzlsta force to aid a detach
ment of Troop F, Eighth IT. S. cavalry
which had surrounded a number of
Mexican bandits in an adobe house
south of Fort Hancock,' Texas, early
yesterday.
The official report from General
Bell at El Paso, received last night,
said two Americans and four Mexi
cans were-killed In the action. Bean,
who accompanied the soldiers, is r»
ported to have summoned al^ from
the Mlexican side of the Rlo Grande
because he feared the bandits would
escape.
Funston believes the Americans
were able to handle the situation with
out assistance and stated today that
Bean's action was unwarranted and
without authority,

ROBS TOWN, Texas, Aug. 1.—
Mother's hand is on this army in the

but so firm a tug, tliat even the big

All their bluff and gold stars and

MOTHERS OF THE SOLDIERS
ARE EXERTING AN INFLUENCE
Colonel John Fraine, of the First
North Dakota, astonished a group ot
correspondents Sunday by shouting
to a passing private, "come hare,
Smith."
Smith approached.
"How long since you've written
home to your mother?" asked tha
colon eL
'.'Two weeks."
"You go back to your tent and stf
down and write 500 words to yam
mother," ordered the colonel.
Five hundred letters dally reach
Major General CJtyen, head ot the
New York forces, who has put 22,
000 youths in the militia. Many of these
ask for release of sons. But an
average of fifty daily contain thanks
of mothers to CRyan for aibolishing
alcohol. Colonels, captains, lieuten
ants, sergeants—no officer is too high
or too low for a mother to pin her
faith to—receive letters daily from
mothers, ordering them, instructing
them, or repeating them to look out
for "my son."
I've talked to officers ot city regi
ments and country regiments of
northern, southern, eastern and west
ern regiments about mothers' activ
ity. The story Is always the same.
Mothers are alike in every corner ot
the United States, and like a vast
anti-war organization they are mak*
lug their influence felt.
American mothers undoubtedly
would endure the sufferings of war
as bravely as any woman on earth,
but their solicitation now tn peace
time, as expressed by thousands of
letters to the border, is an indication
of how aoute are the sufferings ot
the mothers ot Europe with soma In
tha death zone.
