DETERMINED COUNTER-ATTACK
Clpim Allies Have Not Gained a Foot
by Sunday's Attacks.
London, July 31, 10.55 p. m. The
allies maintain unceasing pressure
both on the western and eastern fronts
as well as the Italians on the Austrian
front, and heavy battles are being
fought in all 1 heatres.
The British and French started a
frtsh combined attack on Sunday from
DelviHe wood to the Somme and made
dogged progress which brought them
near the ciilage of Alaurepas. The
misty weather which has hindered the
operations has given place to clear
skies, with intense heat. The Ger
mans are making the most determined
counter-atta'-ks and officially claim
that the allies have not gained a foot
of ground by Sunday's attacks.
The Prussians are continuing their
success and despite the strongest Ger
man resistance are pressing ever closer
to Kovel. According- to tonight's news
they are across the Stokhod over the
whole stretch between the Kovel
Sarny and Kovel-Rojitsche railroads.

Session.
Washington, July SI. Democratic
senators in a caucus tonight voted to
postpone action on the immigration
bill until the next session of congress
and adopted, 3S to 9, a resolution bind
ing all democratic senators to that de
cision. A resolution was then adopted,

down any attempt to attach the immi
gration measure to the child labor bill
as a rider.
The binding resolution, the first of
that nature imposed by a democratic
caucus for several years, was put
through by party leaders to whip in
to line a group of southern senators
who had announced they would sup
port an effort to saddle the child labor
bill, which they oppose, with an im
migration rider including the ob
noxious literary test section in the
hope that President Wilson would
then veto It
The seven senators who voted
against the resolution pledging defeat
of theimmigration rider were Senators

and Beckham, Kentucky.

The theory that tiie lire hich

county, and Theodoif B. Johnson,
president of the Johnson Lighterage
company, owners of the munitions
barge. Roth declared the fire original - I

Lehigh Valley railroad issued .-..iiothor
statement today reiterating Us charge
that the fire had begun on the Johnson
lighter, which they contended was
moored at one 01 its piers without au

3RITISH FOREIGN OFFICE
STATEMENT TO THE A. P.
In eference to Feeding Civilian Popu
lation in German Territories.
London, July 31, S.20 p. m. The for
eign office makes the following state
ment to The Associated Press in reply
to The Associated Press lierlin des
atch of Sundayn having reference 10
the feeding of the civilian populations
in the foreign territories occupied by
the Germans:
"To Ju.Ibv from The Associated
Press message from Merlin, the Ger
man government is attempting to es
cape front the clear issue set before
it by tiie allied governments by try
intr to confuse togei -i(lr as many to
tally different questions ns possible.
"It may lie worth while to explain
the situation.
"There are three distinct questions:
"First, the allied governments have
made a final offer regarding the con
ditions upon whi-h they will accede
to file appeal of tiie president of the
Fnitcd States on behalf of the occu
pied territories which are now re
ceiving no itnnorted foodstuffs.
"Secondly: In a communication
which has not been published the al
lied governments recently demandofl
tint in northern France and in the
military zone of Belgium the German
government should reserve the harvest
for the civil population. This is a
separate neroi lat ion on the same lines
as that underlaken a year ago wiin
regard to last year's harvest in Pel
ii'tn. It is a. neiroi iation for th
proper carrying on of relief work al
ready for j. long time in operation and
is wholly distinct from the first de
mand mentioned jn the preceding par
acranh which re'ates t otho conditions
vt1i...r wo,.it can b,j
star! ed.
"Thirdly, comes the question of the
larger part of PeUtlum under civil ad
ministration. This question is not
the subject of any particular dispute
at the present moment as the German
government was forced last April to
give binding guarantees that no
foodstuffs should be exported from
Belgium or used for the occupying
army. This guarantee applies to ihe
next harvest and although, like all
other guaran'ees. it. is constantly be
ing violated by local German officials
and soldiers, it is a guarantee already
aivrn and which is gradually being
enforcer! by continual representations
from the relief commission.
"It is vain for the Herman govern
ment to trv to confuse these issues.
Faeh is quite clear in itself. '
The Associated Press Herlin des
patch referred to embodied an inter
view with Dr. Alfred Zimmerman, the
Germim nnder-secretary for foreign
affairs, who declared that, nrecard
in cthe German occupied districts m
Poland. German stood by her former
offer, namely to reserve the harvest
fo the civilian inhabitants and sol
diers and policing forces of the army
of occupation as distinct from the
annv of occupation. With reference
to France and Belgium. Dr. Zimmer
man said this question must be decid
ed from headquarters. Tie declared,
however, that should the British
prevent, the importation of food sup
plies for the civilian population, tney
would be place.! on a common footing
with the inhabi'in'fi of Germany.
AMERICAN CONSUL WAS
ON KCNINGIN WILHELMINA
The Dutch Steamer Which Struck a
Mine Near North Hinter Lightship.
The Hague, Netherlands. July 31.
via London, 7.10 p. m. Frank W.
Mahin. the American consul at Am
sterdam, and his wife ?,Trs. Abbie Ha
hin, were the only American passeng
ers on board the Dutch mail steamer
Konlngln Wilhelmina. Both were
saved.
This information was given to The
Associated Press by the Zeeland
Steamship company. It Is not known
whether Mr. and Mrs. Mahin were
saver! by a British destroyer, in
which case they would land in Eng
land, or bv Dutch rescue ships which
are bringing shipwrecked passengers
bade to Flushing.
The Zeeland company informs The
Associated Press that all the passeng
ers and crew were saved, except three
stokers who were killed presumably
by the explosion.
The Koningin Wilhelmina. carry
ing malls to England, ran into a mine
during the forenoon near the North
Hinder lightship, whither the first
passengers to enter lifeboats were
rowed. On arriving at the lightship it
was seen the Koningin Wilhelmina
still remained af.oat, seemingly justi'
fying the hope that the thousands of
empty barrels which she held would
keen her bouyant. The lifeboats ac
cordingly returned to the ship.
The Koningin Wilhelmina, howecer,
began to sink by the head and soon
disappeared. The lifeboats with the
passengers then returned to the North
Hinter lightship, where tVV were
picked up by a British destroyed, two
Dutch torpedo boats and two tugs
with doctors, who had been called for
by wireless before the vessel sank.

TESTIMONY AT HEARING OF THE
COMMISSION YESTERDAY
SAME RATE AS BY RAIL
General Express Agent of the New
Haven Road Testified That Was the
Cause of the Withdrawal of Adams
Express Co. Business in 1914.
New York, July 31. Contentions by
government attorneys that the service
by water between New England and
New York has been reduced and the
aggregate of vessels diminished were
denied by J. Howland Gardner, vice
president of the New England Steam
ship company, at today's hearing be
fore Examiner John II. Howell of the
interstate commerce commission on the
application of the New York, New
Haven and Hartford railroad for per
mission to retain ownership and con
trol of its Long Island sound lines
under the Panama canal act.
Quoted from Reoords.
"Our records show," Mr. Gardner
said, "that the actual aggregate ca
pacity for trips on the Norwich,
Providence, Fall River and New Bed
ford lines increased 40 per cent, be
tween 1S9S and 1914, instead of a re
duction of service."
What Hurt Norwich Line.
Fremont Whitted, general express
agent for the railroad, testified that
the business of the Norwich line was
taken away almost completely by an
order of the interstate commerce com
mission on Feb. 1, 1914, making the
water rate for freight the same as for
the all-rail route. Following the issu
ance of the order, he said, the Adams
Express company withdrew its busi
ness from the steamship line and sent
it by rail. The New Haven road, he
said, did not have anything to do with
the withdrawal.
Testimony of an historical nature
was given by Arthur P. Russell, valua
tion counsel for the road. He denied
charges by Adrian X. Boole, an attor
ney for the interstate commerce com
mission, that the Providence line was
started by Chester W. Chapin with the
object of forcing the New Haven into
buying the boats.
AMERICAN SOLDIERS
BATTLE WITH BANDITS.
Two Americans Killed, One Wounded
Only Two Bandits Escaped.
El Paso, Tex., July 31. American
soldiers, reinforced by a small de
tachment of Carranza troops, engaged
Mexican bandits who had crossed the
Rio Grande into the Ifnited States
about Ave miles below Fort Hancock,
Texas, 55 miles east of here, early
today. Two Americans were killed and
one was wounded. Only two of the
oj;itlavs escaped across the river into
Mexico, where they are being pursued
by Mexican troops and Carranaz cus
tom guards.
Lpon receiving reports from Robert
Wood, a United States customs in
spector, that the bandits, who had
committed numerous depredations on
the Mexican side of the frontier re
cently, had crossed the border, six men
of Troop F, Eighth United States cav
alry, and a hospital corps orderly un
der Sergeant Lewis Thompson, with
Wood and Customs Inspector Bean,
rode to an adobe house where the
Mexicans were said to be in hiding.
Thompson had been ordered by Cap
tain H. D. Cushtng of Company C,
Eighth Massachusetts infantry, to in
vestigate the. reports. The bandits
opened Arc from the building and ad
joining outhouses, killing Wood and
Private John Twomey and wounding
Sergeant Thompson in the shoulder.
Bean, fearing that t'he Mexicans would
escape the small American detachment,
called upon the Carmnzista command
er on the opposPe side of the river.
He responded with a score of soldiers,
crossing into the United States to cut
off the outlaws' retreat, the incident
marking the first time Carranzista sol
diers have co-operated in pursuit of
bandits on American soil.
Private Francis E. Sheain of Balti
more. Md., of the hospital corps, who
brought Sergeant Thompson to the
Fort P.iiss hospital, reported to Gen
eral Bell that the Mexican troopers, 10
in number, acted in a friendly manner
towards the Americans, took up a po
sition alongside them and helped keep
up a hot fire against the hut. AYhen
the bandits failed to return the fire
the hut was entered and three, dead
Mexicans were found. Sheain said. The
Carfnnza troops took up a blood trail
and followed it, but the American de
tachment stayed on this side of the
river.
Twomey, Sheain said, bled to death
from a wound in the lung and Wood
was shot twice, one bullet entering
above the heart, another in the breast.

A Canadian High Area Pressure Bring
ing Down the Cool Air.
Washington, July 31. A Canadian
high area pressure bringing down
cool, dry air from the Canadian north
west sweipt along the whole of north
ern United States today and afforded
some relief from the heat wave which
has been the worst in fifteen j'ears.
Riughly, the new high pressure has
brought a drop in temperature every
where north of a line drawn due west
from New York. Below this line its
effects were felt in some districts with
a change of a few degrees.
The "Bermuda high" which for the
past ten days had been sweeping up
currents of hot, water-laden air from
the tropics over the wdtole of continen
tal United States showed signs today
of having pretty well spent itself.
Likewise, the high pressure area which
brought relief to the Atlantic seaboard
from Hudson Bay over the week-end
has been dissipated.
Weather bureau officials said today
that while the great central sections
of the country had had the hottest
period since 1901, the Atlantic sea
board hardly been touched by real
summer.
