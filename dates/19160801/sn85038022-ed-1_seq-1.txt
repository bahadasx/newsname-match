and Colonel Roosevelt clapped his
hands In acknowledgment.
General Harding, of Ohio, chairman
of the notification committee, was
cheered at every reference to tin
name of the nominee and a Repub
lican victory In November. When he
had finished the band played and the
crowd arose and cheered again.
Mr. Hughes was hreuently Inter
rupted by laughter and applause. Af
ter delivering his speech, he was nost
at a reception to the notification
committee and the invited guests to
the notification ceremonies.
Mr. Hughes assailed the adminis
tration for the course it has pursued
with reference to Mexico, maintenance
of American rights during th
European war, preparedness, and
other questions of the day. He de
clared for a new policy of "firmness
and consistency" toward Mexico, fo:
"the unflinching maintenance of Amer
ican rights on land and sea," and foi
"adequate national defense ; adequate
protection on both our western and
eastern coasts."
"We denounce all plots and con
spiracies in the Interest of any foreign
nation," Mr. Hughes said. "Utterly

unreservedly condemn them and sup
port every effort for their suppres
sion." The nominee assailed the adminis
tration for Its "direction of diplomatic
intercourse," from the beginning de
claring that where there should have
been conspicuous strength and expert
ness, there had been weakness and In
expertness. He sighted San Domingo
as an instance where appointments
had gone to "deservlug Democrats"
and to decisions not to continue Am
bassador Herrlck at his post in Paris,
after the war had started aa "a la
mentable sacrifice of international
repute."
Woman Suffrage Indorsed
"I endorse the declaration in the
platform in favor of woman suffrage,'
Mr. Hughes declared. "Operation may
ueiay, Dut in my judgment can not
defeat this movement. I favor the
ballot for women."
One-fourth of the apeech was de
voted to Mexico. Step after step taken
by the administration with reference
to Mexico was assailed, from the days
of Htterta to the note sent the de facto
government by the State Department
June 20, the last part of which was
quoted In the speech. The seizure of
Vera Crux, the nominee said, "was war,
of course."
"Later we retired from Vera Crus."
he continued, "giving up this noble
warfare. Recently the naked truth
was admitted by a cabinet officer. We
are now Informed that we did not eo
to Vera Cruz to force Huerta to salute
the flag. We are told that we went
there to show Mexico that we were in
earliest in our demand that Huerta
must go."
"America," Mr. Hughes continued,
"had no policy for any part of her ter
ritory, but wishes her to have peace
stability and prosperity."
"The conduct of the administration
has created difficulties we shall have
to surmount." he said. "We demand
front Mexico the protection of the Uvea
and properties of our citizens and the
security of our border from depre
dations." CAJOAKui OI'KNINIi
The Tri-County Farmers' Chautau
qua held at the Germantown Fair
Grounds Saturday, Sunday and Mon
day was a great success from every
standpoint.
The Sunday program was the leader
of the entertainment. It la estimated
that from 11)00 to lfOO persons were
present on the grounds. The crowd
was well behaved and nothing happen
ed to mar the occasion during the
day.
Judge J. H. Barker of Iexingtoii
Ky., of the State University gave an
address during the morning 'to the
fanners. Judge Barker Is a man of a
rare personality and his address was
well received by his hearers. He seems
to have a way to "get next to" his
hearers. By many It is claimed tnn.
he was the beat number of the entire
Chautauqua.
AftMf the morning session a big
basket dinner was held on the grounds
All participated In the affair, f
In the afternoon Dr. K. B. Barnes
o' Richmond, Ky., led a union service
on the grounds which was very In
spiring. Dr. Barnes Is a wonderful
speaker and greatly Impressed those
Who beard him. He was aided by sev
eral of the local preachers In his ser
vice. The service reminded one of a
fcampmeeting. Prof. T. J. Currey of
Maysville gave a talk to the farmers
which was greatly enjoyed.
The Monday's program was the
'windup of the chautauqua. In the
morning a stirring address by Dr.
Fred Mutohler on "Co-operation" and
another address by Mr. George Rob
erts on "Cropping Systems" were very
Instructive and interesting. Mr. Rob
erts gave the scientific way to raise-
crops and many farmers will be great
ly benefitted by his remarks on the
subject. 4
The afternoon session was opened
by a talk by Miss Chlnn on Home
Conveniences." A great many ladles
heard Miss Chiun and profited by her
talk. Mr. George Roberts wave anoth
er talk on "SoU Fertility" which waj
greatly enjoyed. Mr. Fred Mutchler I
closed the chautauqua by Ills final
lecture "Demonstration Work In Ken
tucky." The music for the three days or
good things was furnished by the Ly

of the best concert companies in this

The success of the rhsiitauqua was
greatly due to the efforts of Ranker R

Vf Germantown These men worked a
great deal to secure the chautauqua
and after securing It made it a success
by Issuing a folder of the chautauqua
'and urging the farmers to come to it.
Their work was rertslnly appreciated
In helping to make the chautauqua a
success.
