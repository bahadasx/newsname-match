FINDS REAL CRISIS
(By Tas Associated Press.)
EW YORK, July 31. Two years
ngo tomorrow Germany and Aus
tria formally declared war
N
against Knssia, which had begun mobil
izing immediately after tbe declara
tion of war upon Serbia, made five
days before by Vienna. This was,
therefore, the real commencement of
the great Kuropean war.
On August 2, 1SH4, the first fighting
ot tl onflict was reported, when
L'll.l i I Hermans attempted to invade
Kiunce in the neighborhood of Haar
buriT. 1. onnne, but were thrown back.
At the same time 100,000 Germans in
vsded the Duchy of Luxemburg, and
on thut date a German order confls
rated all the British ships in tbe Kiel
t'nmil un. I the British steamer Saxon
at ('uxliHen. Germany also demanded
.i i miHMiin to pass through Belgium on
Iwr way to attack France, a demand
which ns refused. Great Britain did
not declare war until August 5.
The cecum! year of the world war
closes l ith the "Buttle of Kurope," a
concerted effort of the Allies on three
front h to crush the Central Bowers,
which has developed into a titanic
struggle before which superlatives, al
ready exhausted, ure completely begi
gated.
France and Great Britain in the
west. KiiHHiti in the east, Italy in tbe
south are hurling wave after wave of
armed men on the Teutonic lines, to
gether with an avalanche of shells and
bombs such as the world has not known
un to the present tiin. For the first
time the Teutons are, temporarily at
leii.it, on the defensive on the thousands
of miles of the existing battle fronts.
The chnuge in the situation which
the year has brought is striking, al
though the results so far have been
more potential and spectacular than
radical. A year ago the Germans, con
tinuing their great drive against the
'KusMims, hurled the Slavs buck along
the entire eastern front, captured War
snw, the great fortresses of Kovno,
Novo Georrievsk and Brest-Litovsk
ii mi established lines tar inside Russian
territory which they maintained vir
tually unbroken until within tbe last
three months. They seized all l'oland,
a great slice of Russia to the south of
that country and expelled the Invaders
from (iiilieia nnd Bukowiua. Field
Marshnls von Hlndenlnirg and Macken
sen were the heroes of these great suc
cesses. West Change Bmall
On the western front the changes In
position during the year were compara
tively smtill. Jiut the twelve months
were marked l.y three events nf inter-
i est: The battles of t'liniQagne and
I Verdun nnd the opening of the greiit
I Frn nco Hntinh offensive on tbe Hoiniiic
took place in this period.
The battle of CliHinpugne opened on
September -"i, after a week's terrific
bombardment of the German lines by
the French, British nnd Belgians. In
a week of the bloodiest fighting that
-(D

had been known np to that time Ihe
Allies announced that they . hnd till
twenty miles t( trenches, six towns and
23,000 prisoners. But there tbev halt
ed. Thev could not break through the
mighty German wull, and the grim
deadlock which marked the western
front for so ninny months was re
sunu il l he liattle or Cliniiipugue
marked the removal of Sir John French
the British commander-in-chief from
the beginning of the war up to that
time. In December, IHI.i, it was an
nounced th.it he bad resigned to take
a home cominnud and Sir Douglas lLu
was appointed his successor.
In sheer human interest the Battle of
Verdun probably surpassed all other
Individual events of the war. On Feb
ruarv L'.l the German Crown Prince be
gnu his assault of the historic French
fortress, known throughout many cen
turies as the gateway to France. For
five mouths the defenders withstood a
stonn at the fury of which the world!
stoisl aghnst. Foot by foot, almost
inch bv inch, the Germans forged for
ward, with n reckless disregard of their
lives, a tenacity and cool courage which
was only equalled hy the heroic deter
miiintiot' '' the French. On June 3 an
usollii ial , -innate of the German losses
at Verdun placed th" litftl at the ap
palling ligure of ISO 000. The assail
ants fought their why to within about
three uiol a half miles of the fortress,
but for several weeks have reported no
fuither progress und the forcn of their
attack appears to have lessened.
Big Rush Begins
'I'!,.- Franco British offensive on the
Homme opened on July 1,1010. It was
preceded bv a bombardment of unparul
leled duraiion mid intensity, featured
by the a ppea rn nee of new and gigantic
British howitzers. Under this awful
hurricane of big gun (ire the GeruiHii
first line defenses crumbled. When the
Hriti.-di and French troops advanced
they icpoiteil that they' found trenches
in which there was not a Mingle sur
vivor, only the dead guarded the silent
rirles und machine gnus. German first
lines were curried over an extent of
tweutv li v miles und the second posi
tious pi rrcd at certain points, but up
to the piesent the fighting has been ill
