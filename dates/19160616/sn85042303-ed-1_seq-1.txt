Hour Continuous Work on Platform Asked Walsh and
Harding to Read Platform
Coliseum, June 16. Because
of a slight delay, chairman
Stone vfas not ready to report
the resolutions immediately af
ter the opening of today's ses
sion. When the platform was
ready, Stone said he had not
slept for thirty hours and dele
gated the reading of the plat
form to Senators Walsh and
Harding.
The reading of the platform
required one hour. The Mexi
can plank was most frequently
applauded. When the reading
was completed, Senator Stone
moved its adoption.
The reading of the labor
planks brought applause and
the suffrage plank brought
more applause from the men
than the women. The reading
was completed' at 1:20, after
fifty-eight minutes. Immedi
ately Chairman Stone had mov
ed for the adoption of the re
port, William Lomasney, a del
egate from Massachusetts, ex
cepted and after wrangling
some, allowed him ten minutes.
It turned out that Lomasney
wanted to put a plank in the
platform expressing the sym
pathy of the convention for
"the people of Ireland." "Raus
mit him," shouted a delegate
from Maryland. It was refered
to the resolutions committee.
Governor Ferguson of Texas
then presented the minority re
port on the suffrage plank. Un
der the agreement there was to
be thirty minutes debate for
each side. When Governor Fer
guson had finished speaking
for the minority report, Senator

jority report.
Governor Ferguson declared he en-
dorsed the state's right amendment ,
desnite its possible political inexpe
diency. "The majority plank is not
the belief of the demcoratic party,
said, "and in a desire to secure
V .. .... . J: fnfal
a little political menuuiB mm
surrender of democratic principles Is
made. The crux of the whole situa
tion is that we were told if we didn't
adopt the majority report, we might
lose three or four western states."
The Texas governor pleaded eloquent
ly in the convention not to lay aside
the old and honored principles of the
democratic party regarding state's
ghts. While he was speaking a few
omen in the front row of the gallery
hissed bis remarks. Mingled applause
and hissing followed this action.
When Stone started speaking he re
ferred to Ferguson hy saying, "He
makes a man of straw and then de
molishes him."
At 11:52 last night, WoodroV Wil
son and Thomas Riley Marshall were
nominated by acclamation as the
standard bearers of the democratic
party in the first night session of the
democratic convention. No ballots
were taken. The delegates simply
roared "aye" when their names were
called. Because the rules committee
was not ready to report, the conven-

to Convention
tion adjourned at 12:30 until 11 o'clock
today.
The final days' session of the demo
cratic convention was opened at 11:26
today, when Chairman James imme
diately called on the resolutions com
mittee to submit its final draft of the
program, which contains more than
4,000 words.
After a short preamble, the plat
form opens with the brief statement,
"We endorse the Wilson administra
tion. It speaks for itself."
In turn the platform chronicles the
accomplishments of the Wilson admin
istration, starting the federal reserve
system, the federal trade commlssita
the adjustment of the tariff "adequate
for revenue under peace conditions,"
the advancement of the parcels post,
better rights for the workingmen.
The platform asks for the immediate
development of the foreign trade of
the United States, citing the merchant
marine as a primary factor. The plat
form condemns those persons of di
vided allegiance, who seek to foment
internal discord and strife" for the
advancement of the interest of any
foreign power," and condemns spe
cifically all alliances or combinations
of individuals "conspiring foe the pur
pose of embarrassing the govern
ment.." """"
Preparedness Is treated briefly in
a declaration for an adequate army
for the protection of the nation's
rights, the continuous development of
the navy and an adequate reserve of
citizens trained to arms.
Under international relations, it
says the democratic party has held
to the old path of neutrality and be
lieves that the United States should
join in a world court to maintain in
violate the open use of the highway
of the seas.
The platform declares for Tan-Am
erican concord and bases the Mexl-
.an nnllcv simnlv on the Monroe doc-
" -
trine. The Mexican plank also says
that the troops should of necessity
remain in Mexico until order has been
restored, although the party is against
intervention or subjugation.
The suffrage plank reads: "We rec
ommend an extension of the franchise
to the women of the country by the
states upon the same terms as men.
In discussing labor, the platform de
clares the party's faith in the sea-
men's act; favors an effective fed
eral bureau of safety.
Governor Ferguson of Texas was a
member of the committee of four
which submitted the minority report
on the suffrage plank in the demo
cratic platform, declaring that suf
frage was a question of state sover
eignty and that federal endorsement
would be in violation of the honored
principles of democracy.
Under "Protection of Citizens" the
platform declares the sacred rights of
American citizenship, must be pre
served at home and abroad and no
treaty with any othef government
shall receive the sanction of the Uni
ted States government which does
not expressly recognize the right of
expatriation. The platform demands
modern principles of prison Tefonn
be applied to our federal penal system.
