'Mr Chairman and Delegates:
hnvu not desired the nomlniition,
hove wished to remain on tbo banuh
I In t in this critical period of our
lin'ionul history 1 recognize that
is your right to summon, and that
it is my paramount duty to respond
You speak it t a time of national
exigency, tinnsccnding merely par
tisHii considerations. You voice
tho (leiiuitiil for a dominant, thorn
iighgoing Americanism, with firm
protective upbuilding policies us
sential to our pence and security,
and to that call, in till? crises I
cannot fail to answer with tbo
pledge ol all Hint is in me to the
success of tho country. Therefore
I accept tho nominal ion.
"I stand for tho firm und uu
llltiehing malntninnnee of all tho
rights of Atneiiciin citizens on land
and sea. I neither impugn motives
nor underestimate difficulties. Hut
It N muht regrettably true In our
foreign relations we hove suffered
incalculably from the weak and
vacillating course which has been
taken with regard to Mexico of
course lamentably wrong wild ie
gard both to our rights mid our
duties. We interfered without
cniiiistcoc.y , und while seeking to
díctalo when wo were not concern
ed, wu utterly failed to npnroeiate
und discharge our plain duty to
our own clilzuns.
" At the outset of the mltnlni
tratiuu tho high responsibilities of
nir diplomat iu Intorcnurso with
ftiieluu nations were subordinated
to a conception of partisan require
inenlH, and wu proronicd to I ho
world it humiliating spectacle of
inaptitude. Helatod efforts havo
not availed to recover the mlliionec
and prestige so unfortunalulv ucn
flood, mid bravo words have been
stripped of their forre by indecisión
"1 deslro to see our diplomacy
restored to its best standards and
to have tbrso advanced; to.havo no
sacrifico of tbo naiinnal Interost to
partisan expediencies; to havo the
first ability of tho country always
al its command hern and nbrosd in
diplomatic intercourse, to maintain
firmly our rights under Internatloii
al law; Insisting atcadfastly upon
ail our rights as noutral and fully
performing our international obli
gations; and by tho clear enrroct
ness and justness of our position
Hon our manifest ability mid dis
position to sustain thorn to dlgnl
tiy our placo among the nations.
"I ttntid for an Americanism that
knows no ulterior purpose, and for
a patriotism that is singlo and com
pleto. Whether native or natural
ized, of whatover ruco or creed, we
have but one country and wo do
not lor an Instant ti leratu any di
vision of allegiance I believe in
making prompt provision to secure
abfoluioly our nut 'final security I
bello ve in pieparrdness, not only
entirely odequa'o for our defense
with respect to numbers and equip
ment In both army and navy, but
witliall thoroughness to tho Mid
thai In ouch branch of tho service
Ibero may be tho utmost efficienov
under the most competent ad
miuistrotlvo heads.
"Out wu are devoted to the ideals
or hoiiornlilo penco. We su to
promoto all wise and praciical mea
sutes Inr tho just settlement of in
ternatinoal disputes In view ol
our abiding ideal, there is no dang
ft, of militarism in this country
Wo have no policy of aggression
no lust for territory; no zeal for
si rifo It is in this spirit that we
demand ndpquute provision for tin
tioind defensu and we condemn the
inexcusable nueleot that has been
shown iu this matter of first uu
lional importance. Wu must have
i lie strength which self-respect de
miinds, tho strengih of an efficient
notion ready for every emergency
"Uur preparation must lie Indus

after war is iver. We must mske
a filr and wise readjustment of the

protective principles, to insure our
economic independence and
maintain American standards

interests of labor, realizing that
democracy, patriotism apd national
strength must bo rooted in oven
handed justice. In preventing,
wo must, unjust discriminations
and monopolistic practices, wo must
still lie zealous to assure tho fornida
