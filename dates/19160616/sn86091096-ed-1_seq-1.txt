KENDRICK. LATAH COUNTY. IDAHO. FRIDAY. JUNE 16. 1916
NUMBER 24
AND STOLE HORSES
Now in Jail at Moscow Facing
Charge
Olaf Olson, about 25 years of age,
who has been employed as a farm
laborer on Big Bear ridge for the
past three or four years, is in the
county jail at Moscow to answer to
the charge of grand larceny and
arson.
It seems Olson took a team of
horses belonging to W. L. Blenden,
a farmer on Big Bear ridge, tied
these horses in the stable of another
farmer named Swensen, set fire to
the building and brought the Swen
sen horses to Kendrick where they
were recovered when Olson was
arrested.
The Swensen barn was burned
about three o'clock A. M. Wednes
day June 7, and was acomplete loss.
The carcasses of the horses were
almost consumed and while Mr
Swensen could not explain the cause
of the fire it was not until well into
Wednesday afternoon that he dis
covered that the horses burned
were not his. This discovery was
made because the hoofs of the
horses burned carried no shoes
while his horses were newly shod.
Mr. Blenden missed his horses in
the pasture Wednesday morning and
when the report of the Swensen
incident gained circulation, he
visited the Swensen ranch and
identified the burned horses, the
identification being made by the
condition and shape of the hoofs.
The hunt for the missing Swensen
horses was then commenced and
they were located in a private barn
here where they had been placed by
Olson.
When Olson was placed under ar
rest, he had little to say about how
he came into possession of the Swen
sen horses and declined to discuss
the burning of the barn or the
disappearance of the Blenden horses.
"Titanic Wheat"
The department has recently been
advised by a correspondent in Cali
fornia that a variety of wheat is
being advertised under the name
"Titanic." The assertion is made
that it is a new variety of wheat dis
covered in England four years ago
and that a small quantity of seed
was brought to the United States
by one of the survivors of the ill
fated Titantic. The wheat is repre
sented as having extremely high
yielding power, the returns reach
ing as high as 7,000-fold. A photo
graph sent by this correspondent |
shows a head identical in appear
ance with the widely exploited
"Alaska" wheat. Five acres of the
wheat are said to be growing in the
Hate of Washington, and the seed,
'"It is believed, will be offered at
high prices after harvest. The
department has no futher or more
definite information concerning this
variety, but farmers and dealers are
cautioned to be on their guard con
cerning this new exploitation.

METLAST FRIDAY
Matters of Interest to'The
Community Discussed
At a meeting of the Commercial
Club Friday night of last week it
was definitely decided not to hold
a celebration here the Fourth of
July. Southwick has advertised a
celebration to be held there on the
Fourth and Big Bear ridge is going
to celebrate at Atwater lake so it
was thought best not to attempt a
celebration here.
The matter of giving a fair in
the fall was brought up and enthu
siastically received. Kendrick seems
to be united in the idea of a fair
and the interest already being shown
by the business men of the town
assures the success of the enterprise.
General sentiment seems to be to
make the fair this fall the biggest
and best thing that Kendrick has
ever undertaken. The idea of
treating everyone who comes, as a
guest rather than a customer, will
be the motto of the Fair Association.
Mr. Barnum made the proposition
to furnish lumber at a reasonable
price at the mill to build a fence
around the ball ground, the lumber
to be hauled by anyone who
might volunteer the work. The
fence to be erected by the business
men who will also volunteer their
services. This would give the Fair
Association an opportunity of mak
in K much more elaborate prepara
it was suggested and unanimously
approved that season tickets for the
tions than it has ever been able to
make before and would give a per
manent place to hold the fair and
also provide a ball ground for the
team next year.
The proposition was accepted and
a committee appointed to meet with
the town council to get permission
from them to use the ground.
fair be sold as that would give the
management something to start on
and give a general idea of the
amount of support that might be
expected,
Mr. Atchison offered to furnish
the timbers necessary to be used to
straighten the "goose neck" in the
road on Powell grade, between Ken
drick and Juliaetta. John Woody
said he would put the proposition
up to the county commissioners and
he believed there was no question
but that they would make a liberal
cash donation toward meeting the
expense of making the improvement.
The matter was put to a vote and
passed and the road committee of
the Chamber of Commerce author
ized to go ahead with the work.
Officers for the ensuing year were
elected as follows: Ralph Knepper,
president and H. P. Hull, secretary.
j There being no other business the
meeting adjourned
A Possible Candidate
Some time ago the Lewiston Tri
bune published an article suggest
ing Wickliffe R. Smith of South
wick as a candidate for Superinten
dent of Public Instruction on the
Republican ticket for Nez Perce
county. The article brought fourth
many expressions of approval from
residents of the county and Mr.
Smith has been urged to make the
race. He has been a resideht of the
county for over sixteen years and
has a large acquaintance.
Mr. Smith has served two terms
in the legislature and his long
experience in school work in the
county together with his educational
qualifications would make him a
strong candidate for the position,
He seems to be the most likely
j candidate of any in the county.

Latah County Schools
The largest number of pupils in
the history of the Latah county
eighth grade schools took the exami
nations the present year, according
to figures compiled by Miss Bryden,
county superintendent. A list of
the eighth grade pupils has been
prepared by Miss Bryden.
According to her figures 214 di
plomas were issued to schools ex
clusive of Moscow and the Ursuline
academy which did not take the
state examinations this year. Mos
cow is a Class A independent dis
trict, the only one in the county.
According to comparisons only 158
diplomas were issued in 1915 ex
clusive of Moscow and Ursuline
academy.
Due to increased interest in edu
cation, the compulsory attendance
law and better teaching due to the
high standard now required of
teachers, the records show the small
est per cent of failures in the his
tory of the county. The average
age of the pupils taking the exami
nations is lower. The minimum
age completing the eighth grade
this year is 12 years, 87 taking
examinations giving their ages as
16, 32 as 17 years, 8 as 18, and 1
as 19 years. The average age is
from 13 to 15.
The highest class average was
made by Potlatch and Catherine
Gleave, a member of the Potlatch
class, made the highest average
attained by any pupil, 94 per cent.
The highest average made by a Troy
pupil was attained by Carl Halstrom
at 92 1-3 per cent. - This pupil was
the winner in the county spelling
contest this year and will rep
resent Latah county at the inter
state spelling contest in Spokane
this fall. Chris Carl Zoyer made
the highest average of the Kendrick
class with 92 1-9 per cent and Cecil
A. Boliou secured the highest aver
age in the Genesee class with 90 1-9
per cent. The highest average
made by a pupil in a one-room
rural school went to Inez Johnson
of the Bear Creek school at 90 1-3
per cent.

Has-Beens Will Stage Fast
Exhibition.
The baseball game to be played
today between the Juliaetta and
Kendrick business men promises to
be an exciting event. The Ken
drick business men have been prac
ticing every evening this week and
are in fine condition to play. Many
thanks are due "Ole" Grenolds for
hauling the players to the ball park
every evening in his car.
The Kendrick line-up is composed
principally of has-beens such as A.
E. Wilcox, Waide, Woody, Comp
ton and others, but a great deal is
expected of them nevertheless.
Wilcox weighs something like three
hundred pounds so it will be im
possible to knock the ball through
him. Woody and Waide were
barred from practice because every
time they hit the ball it was lost
in the brush across the Potlatch.
Compton runs bases like a rabbit
and if he gets a base on balls it is
good for a home run any time.
Manager Wilcox unearthed so
many old moth-eaten ball players
around town when he called for
volunteers for the Friday game,
that it will be hard to simmer the
number down to only nine men.
The fact that almost enough players
have journeyed to the ball ground
every evening to compose two
teams, is a good indication of the
interest taken.
The proceeds of the game will be
turned over to the Kendrick ball
team to help defray the expense of
the season. The band has cheer
fully volunteered its services and
will play before and during the
game.
The line-up of the local team will
be sifted out of the following
bunch:—Patton, Wilcox (manager)
Randall, Porter, Thomas, Knepper,
Woody, Dunkle, Flo, Waide, Wenz
laff, Long, C. G. Compton and many
others.
Nez Perce Case Decided
Boise, Idaho, June 13.—The com
missioners of Nez Perce county had
no legal right to make an appropria
tion of $2500 to the Northwest Live
Stock association.
The supreme court of this state
so holds in a per curiam decision
handed down today in the case of
H. M. Fluharty versus the board of
county commissioners of Nez Perce
county and the Northwest Live
Stock association. That tribunal,
therefore, holds under the provi
sions of section 4, article 12 of the
state constitution that section 3040
of the revised codes contravenes the
constitutional provision, and is
therefore unconstitutional, null and
void.
The decision is of unusual im
portance in that it effects the right
of county commissioners in the mat
tgr of making donations to private
fairs or associations.
Tuesday afternoon twelve of the
Queen Esther Circle girls with their
leader Mrs. Best went on a hike up
