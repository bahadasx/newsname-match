One of the Greatest
Lord Kitchener's tragic death'
removes the last of the only three
great soldiers whom Great Britain
has had in the past century the
Duke of Wellington, Lord Roberts
and K. of K. Nothing could
more strikingly show the un
military character of that
country. Even the United
States, which makes no pretense
to warlike prowess, has developed
many more generals of world-wide
fame. This is not necessarily to
the discredit of Great Britain.
Iler greatest strength has always
lain in her navy, and no country
ever had a finer body of sea com
manders. They are no less able
today than in tho days when they
did so much to crush Napoleon's
power--pbilfvdelpma Keord,
In Can of Victory
III. France.
France has an old score to settle
with Germany a defeat in arms,
a huge indemnity imposed as a
penalty of defeat, the loss of im
portant and much-prized prov
inces, followed by a succession of
humiliating interferences with 1M
policies, both foreign and domes
tic. France was patient. It
never nought a quarrel with Ger
many. Even when tne present
war was impending, it lent its aid
to eyery proposal that would tend
to preserve peace.
But the war that France did
not seek was forced upon it; and
nobly has the nation borne itself
during all these months. In the
event of victory it can make no
demand that its allies will not
gladly support. It is not likely,
however, to ask for any territory
except lost provinces on the
Rhine. As an act of retributive
justice it would be entitled to a
return of those milliards in cash
that Germany exacted in 1871.
If France should win, its great
gain would be to get rid of the
overbearing surveillance and the
imperious dictation that it has
suffered from German chancellors,
from Bismarck to Jietnniann iiou
weg. Yet if the victory lies with the
Entente Allies. France will have a
great part in the new Europe.
The ancient Hostility uetween
France and Great Britain had dis
artneared before the war began,
and brotherhood in the field has
cemented between them an endur
ing friendship. The union of the
two powers will give them a com.
manding voice in the councils of
Europe. The policy of both dif
fers most widely from that of
Germany. They will have no
designs, open ir occult, rgainsi
any of the smaller powers. On
the contrary, they will be defend
ers of the little nations against ag
gression. With Russia they will
form a league to insure peace.
Historv gives many examples
of attempts, some successful,
others unsuccessful, by military
chieftains and sovereigns, to as
sume the leadership of Europe,
and many conflicts to preserve tne
"halance of Dower" by defeating
such attempts. It gives us no
previous example oi an ainancc
formed expressly to maintain the
riehts of every nation, great and
small, to prevent the domination
of any power througn its military
strength, and to enforce peace by
hostile measures against any
nation that may wantonly attack
a weaker neighbor.
Tribute To Mosby
When John S. Mosby, a young
Virginia lawyer, at the outbreak
of the civil war enlisted as a
private, he had absolutely no
military training training. By
his audacity, resourcefulness and
tireless love of adventure, he be
came one of the South's most ef
fective cavalrymen. He and Fitz
Lee were "Jeb" Stuart's two
favorites.
As a scout and raider, operat
ing in the northern tier of Vir
ginia, Mosby made his name hated
and feared by Northern generals.
Whether at the head of his picked
body of men, the "Partisan Rang
ers," or a battalion of Virginia
cavalry, he was always on the
move, always preparing surprises.
If he was hard pressed or in seri
ous danger, he disbanded his men,
to meet him again at a given
place.
It was Mosby's boast that he
held receipts for over 6,000 led
erals taken by himself and his
troopers. He destroyed and cap
tured millions of dollars' worth of
supplies. In one raid he cap
tured two Fedeial paymasters
with $168,000 in money, cut Sher
man's railroad communications,
burned a large quantity of rolling
stock and bagged a Northern
brigadier eeneral.
In the North Mosby was
branded as a lawless and barbar
ous guerilla and accuse of rpj)
