Opportune Time
for Labor
Scarcity of Labor Makes Opportune
Time for Demands for
Betterments
Committee on Industrial Relations
Washington.—Steady increase in the
demand for labor and in the wages
received by labor is the distinguishing
feature of all the issues of the Monthly
Review of the United States Bureau
of Labor statistics for this year. The
showing, while made with reference
to typical selected industries, applies
to all industry. It is exceedingly grati
fying as further evidence of labor's
great opportunity in this period to de
mand and receive its rightful rewards.
The contrast of employment and
earnings in February, 1916. with Feb
ruary, 1915, shows a large per cent of
increase in the number of employes
on the pay roll in all the trades ex
cept one, that of the men's ready
made clothing trade. In the iron and
steel trade it was 43 per cent. The
percentage of increase in the amount
of the total pay rolls ran from 5 per
cent in cotton manufacture to 73 per
cent in the iron and teteel trade.
Ninety of the largest iron and steel
plants show 113,112 employes working
on the last day of February, 1916, as
against 78,026 working on the last of
February, 1915, an increase of 45 per
cent. Something more than 3,000 em
ployes were added in 83 of these es
tablishments in the one month of
February.
Further data gathered by the statis
tical bureau confirms these partial
but typical statistics. With the de
crease in immigration labor is not
now at the mercy of employers who try
to keep two workers in competition
for every one job.
Organized labor has this opportun
ity and sees it.

ASSAIL NEARING DISMISSAL
"An infringement of freedom of
teaching in economics," is the charge
against the board of trustees of the
University of Pennsylvania by the
American Association of University
Professors, in the case of the dis
missal of Professor Nearing.
In I report the investigators an
nounce that the dimsissal of Professor
Nearing by university officials "was
unmistakably based upon objections to
the character of Dr. Nearing's social
and economic teachings, or what the
objectors supposed to be his teach
ings."
OTIS GETS IT AGAIN
The Ix)s Angeles Times has lost a

Joseph Scott, a prominent attorney of

victory won by Mr. Scott in libel suits
against the Times, and brings the
total in judgments which he has been
awarded up to $68,500.

Unionists Defy
Chief of Police
Right of Free Speech Denied by
Authorities and Unionists
Prepare to Fight
Columbus, Ohio. —The Columbus
Federation of has assigned 10
trade unionists to hold open air meet
ings in front of the various shops "for
the purpose of organizing and educat
ing the workers of the city."
This is the defy of organized labor
to the chief of police and other au
thorities who have been attempting to
deport trade union officials because
they have urged organization. The
unionists charge that fellow workers
have been subjected to the "third de
gree" by the chief of police, that they
have been denied the right of free
speech and have been arrested on
trumped up charges. The federation
of labor has also appointed a commit
tee to solicit funds to sustain a legal
fight, and between these two activities
the workers are confident that the
municipal authorities will make slow
progress in their attack on funda
mental rights.
BLACKLIST IN PITTSBURG
KEEPS STRIKERS FROM JOBS
Pittsburg.—The blacklist, which is
inforce at the Westinghouse plant
here since the recent strike, is forcing
the strikers who apply for their old
jobs to all sorts of subterfuges in or
der to avoid detection. Some are
making applications in entirely dif
ferent departments, others are posing
as strangers, saying they were from
Detroit and other cities, in order to
get the jobs that mean a living to
them.
One of the commonest forms of
evading the danger of forfeiting their
jobs because they dared protest
against the inhuman conditions under
which they worked is for the workers
to apply under assumed names. The
company, it is said, is discharging
every one known to have been active
in the strike.
LONGSHOREMEN WIN
Word was received Friday morning
that a temporary settlement of the
controversy between the longshore
men and their employers had been se
cured and that the men were to go
back to work, with all demands grant
ed, pending the completion of nego
tiations between their district board
and the representatives of the Water
front Employers' Union.
The result is a complete victory for
the strikers, who by a remarkable
showing of solidarity have tied up
tight the waterfront of the Pacific
Coast from San Diego to Juneau. More
than 2,400 workers in Seattle alone
will be benefited by the sucessful
outcome of this struggle, and along
the coast there is a total of 14,000
affected.
INTOLERABLE CONDITIONS
FORCE GIRLS TO STRIKE
Chicago.—lntolerable conditions at
the factory of the United States
Broom and Brush Company has forced
girls on strike. These employes took
the places of other girls, who struck
a year ago. It is stated that wages
paid by this concern are 50 per cent
less than the union rates and that
it is the only broom factory in the
country that employs females. While
the previous strike was in progress
the foreman was broubht into the
morals court on complaint of girls and
fined.
WHY WORKERS STRIKE
Milwaukee.—The yearly report of
the Allis-Chalmers Company, machin
ery manufacturers, shows how fast
this firm's profits are going up. For
the quarters of 1915 the profit in
creased at the fololwing rate: First
quarter, $8,900: second, $194,800;
third, $333,000; and fourth, $559,000.
Net profits for 1915 were $1,078,000.
Unfilled orders at the close of 1914
were $2,500,000; at the close of 1915,
$11,000,000; on April 1, 1916, more
than $12,000,000.

ORGANIZED LABOR MUST
SAVE INITIATIVE BILLS
I told you a short time ago through
these columns that if our initiative
measures got upon the ballot our peo
ple in the cities where there was gen
eral registration would have to do the
bulk of the work of procuring signa
tures. The universal registration law
has effectually sewed up the country
districts.
Last week I attended the State
Grange convention held in Burlington,
and there I learned at first hand just
how the game was being worked. In
some precincts the registration officer
lives in the extreme end of the pre
cinct, and long, tiresome journeys
were taken by the farmers in order
to register, only to find the registra
tion officer away from home. One
man went six times before he found
the registration officer at home. An
other man waited from 2 o'clock in
the afternoon until 8 o'clock at night
for the officer to return home. In
some precincts persons unfavorable to
our legislative program were In
charge of the registration books and
they purposely made it as hard as
possible for the voters to register.
Two years ago the farmers fur
nished 64 per cent of the signatures
upon our initiative petitions. I>ast
PRICES OF STAPLE FOODS
RISE 8 PER CENT IN YEAR
Figures made public by the Depart

All meat prices increased, as did the
price of sugar. Kggs, milk, flour and
potatoes were cheaper.
l'rices advanced 8 per cent during
the year from March. 1915, to March.

Th 6 Council was called to order

A letter was read from the West

they had withdrawn from the Com

year they furnished 4S per cent of our
referendum signatures. This year the
farmers are up against a registration
law with which they are unfamiliar:
up against officials who do not want
them to register; up against a com
bination of circumstances that makes
it impossible for them to carry their
share of the burden of signature pro
curing.
Nor is it alone in the farming com
munities where the fine Italian hand
of the opposition is seen. In one big
mill plant our circulars found the
registration books in the hands of a
bookkeeper or clerk for the mill com
pany. This company was opposed to
the bills, and this officer was not do
ing anything to assist registration of
the employees, to say the least. In
other cases we have evidence of co
ercion being used by large corpora

held over the heads of the workmen
if they dared to sign the petitions.
What are you union people in the
cities going to do about it? You or
ganized workmen need not fear in
timidation nor discharge, because you
have protection in your organization.

More Immigration
Declared Menace
Frisco Paper Says Present-Day Strike
Shows Independence of
Organized Labor
San Francisco.—The Bulletin of this
city is a consistent advocate of im
migration restriction and believes that
present-day strikes indicate growing
independence on the part of workers
and their refusal to accept "industrial
exploitation" which can be only main
tained by increasing immigration. The
Bulletin makes this observation:
"Unless we are swamped with im
migration the industrial exploitation
and absolutism of the pre-war period
can never be quite restored. When
the present wounds are scars and the
present anger has burned itself out,
the employing classes —or such mem
bers of them as do not seek more
power than ought to be allowed them
in a democracy —will be the better
for living in a country where stand
ards of living and of liberty have been
in some degree raised."

STATE CAPITOL NEWS
Olympia, Junp 15. —Police measures
have been adopted by the board of!
control to protect inmates of the state j
reformatory for girls at Grand Mound
from further annoyance by outsiders.
Until recently no man was employed
about the Institution, the girls and
their instructors doing the farm work
and getting along happily. The ap
pearance of a male face at a window
one night caused the board to employ
a night watchman, who patrols the
reformatory with orders to shoot, if
needful, to protect the institution.
In reply to recent rumors that
charges of cruelty against the reform
atory management had been ignored,
W. H. Cochran, of the state board of
control, made the following statement:
"No girl has ever been struck or has
received corporal punishment in any
form since the opening of this school.
Corporal punishment is prohibited at
this institution, and it is libel upon
the superintendent and lady employes
for any one to make such a state
ment."
A double application of the railroad
demurrage rule has been procured by
the public service commission in an
action before the superior court of
Thurston county, which is the pre
liminary court for all state cases. Rail
roads are prompt as a rule in collect
ing demurrage charges from shippers
who exceed a fixed period in unload
ing cars. Under statutory authority
the commission established what is
called reciprocal demurrage, under
which the shipper is entitled to collect
$1 per day as demurrage from the
railroad company for non-delivery of
cars to a loading point six days after
they are ordered. The Milwaukee
road resisted this charge on a com
plaint by the Schlaefer Warehouse Co.
of Rosalia, the claim amounting to $67.
Judge Wright upholds the commis
sion, which is of considerable value
to grain and other shippers if a sim
ilar view of the rule is taken by the
supreme court, as a means of com
pelling the companies to furnish cars
when they are needed to move crops.
By the latest report of the industrial
insurance commission a total of $6.
