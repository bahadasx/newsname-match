Its Wicked to Waste
Every time you spend money without a suitable
return you're doing yourself and others a wrong.
In buying clothes, for instance, why spend too much?
We can show you where it's folly to pay more
than $10 to $20 forja suit.
Whether you want style, fit, material, wear or
price, Clothcraf t will give, you absolute worth of your
money ""'
If you come in you'll be convinced.
