Again the death angel, that un
evading ; oCcer of God, has winged
his way into onr vicinity and
plucked from another home a
Bweet, tender little flower and car
ried it away to the Master's Heav
enly garden, where it will bloom
forth into radiant beauty. This
lime it was little Katherine David
son, infant daughter, of Mr. and
Mrs. No3h,Pavidson. Eatherine's
stay on earth was very short, only
about nine weeks, and almost from
the beginning the withering blight
of disease was her portion. But
jjow her sufferings are over and she
has gone to that celestial world of
endless peace and happiness, where
sickness is unknown, where death
and sad partings never come, but
all is one continued day of uninter
rupted, supremely' blissful happi
ness. -
May God's richest ; grace, and
sweetest consolation be the happy
portion of loved ones yet on the
rugged shores of time and may
they with the eye of faith look to
yonder sunlit shores of everlasting
felicity and there behold their angel
darling enjoying all the effulgent
beauty of God's bright city, and
may that beautiful vision 15e an in
spiration, an incentive to lead them
to a higher, nobler life; which will
terminate as did little ITatherine's,
in everlasting joy and peaea around
the radiant throna-cf our compia
sionata Heavenly Father.
