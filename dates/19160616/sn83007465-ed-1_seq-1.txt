lie platform had finished its work
but that tin entire resolution commit
f vva n it assembled to pass upon
it and it was not known when that
could lie done. President Wilson t
own plank, charging conspiracy
uniong some foreign born citizens for
the benefit ol foreign powers and.
denouncing any political party whie'.fc,
benefits by and does not repudiate
such a situation, was incorporated in
'.he patform just as the nresilrlbnt Mm *
???lf hue! sent it from Washington. It
was understood that the president ndsted
that the plank should be put
n the platform in the way n< had
lrawn it.
There never was any doubt of
President Wilson's nomination tolight,
but there was a possibility that
iomp vie, presidential booms might
a trough out iu opposition to Vice
President Marshall. They melted
tway, however, when the convention
,'ot in session and as soon as Presilent
Wilson's nomination had been
made by a roaring chorus of acclamation,
Senator Kern ren miina|.i
d Mr. Marshall, east aside a lonrj
I,r p ired spi < ( h and simply declared:
"I nominate Thomas Riley Marhall
of Induine for vice president."

n:e to * 11 convention announcing
(hat he was opposed to the president.
His vol, technical] yinade the president's
nomination 1,091 to 1.
While the convention was asseni
ling t became kgown the Nebraska
lelogat ion planned to withdraw tho
rice presidential candidacy of Gov.
Moorehead. The delegation ex
piaincci that Pivsid? lit Wilson had
not asked for the nomination of Vice
President Marshall \vh n they
irought out their governor's condilacv.
Pefore the convention was
ailed to order the Coliseum was so
rnl! that the fire dbpartment permited
no more to come in. William J.
[Frnynn, however, managed to get br
?r>. 1 got his usual uproarious rec- plon
as he took his seat. Senate**
Fames had learned of ihe Xebrask; *'
alight and rescued him.
At ! :!"> o'clock Chairman .Farms
apped the convention to order.
The crowd yielded to the rapping
>f the gavel long enough to hear the
irayer and then renewed its demands
or a speech from Mr. Bryan.
Senator Thompson then moved
mspension of the rules to permit Mi.
i'.ryan to speak. When the motion
van put there were some "noes." but
he chairman ruled two-thirds bad
roted on the the favor.
A committee, headed by Senator
<ern ot Indiana, escorted Mr. Bryan
o the speake'r place, while the floor
tnd galleries roared their approval.
