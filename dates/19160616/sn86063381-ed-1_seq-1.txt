PRESIDENT NOMINATED
BY DEMOCRATS AT A
MIDNIGHT SESSION
Suffrage Flank is Entirely Unsatisfac
tory to Members of Women's
Party.
WILSON ACCEPTS PLACE
SAYING HE IS GRATEFUL
Resolutions Committee Has an Ail
Night Session Scrap on Floor
Possible.
(By United Press)
St. Louis, June 16.Woodrow Wil
son was nominated president at a
midnight session of the Democratic
national convention. No ballot was
taken The delegates simply roared
"aye" and Chairman Graves declared
Wilson nominated by acclamation.
Discards Speech.
Thomas Marshall was nominated
for vice president. Senator Kern, in
nominating Marshall, discarded a
prepared speech and simply said, "I
renominate Thomas R. Marshall."
Judge Westacott of New Jersey de
livered the address placing Wilson's
name in nomination. Applause was
given his remarks on the policy to
ward Mexico. When he mentioned
the name "Wilson" the crowd broke
into a demonstration. The demon
stration continued for 50 minutes.
President Wilson in Washington
when informed of the action taken
by the convention said, "I am very
grateful."
Merely Words.
Following a 22 hours' continuous
session, the Democratic resolutions
committee this morning agreed up
on a suffrage plank entirely unsatis
factory to women. It declared for
suffrage with the right of states to
decide. Women state that this is
just a number of words.
Suffrage Defeated.
The equal suffrage plank as a na
tional issue was defeated by a vote of
20 to 22. The following amendment
was adopted by a vote of 25 to 20:
"We recommend the extension of the
franchise to women of the country
by states upon the same terms as
men."
Women regard this as merely
passing the buck to the states. Sup
porters say that they will fight it out
on the floor for a resolution for a com
plete constitutional amendment giv
ing women universally the ballot,
All-Night Session.
It was a motley crew of politicians
and statesmen that finished the all
night session. The room on the sec
ond floor of the Planters hotel where
the resolutions committee met was a
sight. The floor was littered with
torn paper, dead stale cigar stumps,
matches and debris. The committee
agreed to a very strong Americanism
plank, preparedness, foreign relations
and Mexico.
Old timers in the convention are
heartily pleased on account of the
differences. They say that it would
not be like an old-time convention
unless there was some row. Then, too
Bryan talked last night and that
helped make things seem like old
times.
Delegates Go Home.
The fight on the platform began
last night at ten o'clcok. The presi
dent's draft was changed three times.
The main fight was on the suffrage
convention between the western and
southern states, with the southern
states opposing suffrage.
Tired, hoarse, sleepy eyed and be
raggled, but happy, Democratic lead
ers met at 11:29 this morning. Many
of the delegates have gone home.
Wilson for Lynch.
The balance of the delegates were
slow in arriving this morning. Huge
sections of the convention floor and
the galleries were vacant. Rabbi
Leon Harrison of St. Paul delivered
the prayer.
Word from Washington last night
was that President Wilson favors
Lynch as the Minnesota delegate.
That settled matters. The formal
ratification of Lynch's appointment
will be made late this afternoon, it
is estimated.
Denounce Americans.
Unmeasured denunciation of hy
phenated Americans, the lauding of
all President Wilson's achievements
during the past three years and the
promise of additional labor legisla
tion besides declarations for Amer
icanism and preparedness are the
features of the Democratic platform
submitted to the convention this af
ternoon following the all-night meet
of the resolutions committee.
