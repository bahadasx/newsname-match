DEMOCRATS ADOPT PLATFORM AS SCHEDULED
Mr. Frank Walgraf, Age 13,
Expresses His Views On the
Various Issues of the Day
Ten minutes after leaving thei
Central school, where he has I
been In regular attendance for'
the last nine months, Mr. Frank j
Walgruf, age It, !>.14 V■_ Broad-,
way, toduy uttered a scathing do-j
iiiiin iaiiuii of existing methods of
education.
Mr. Walgraf's remarks were
made in answer to questions dl
rected to him by an interviewer
from The Times.
Mr. Walgraf expects soni3 day
to lie a spieler for one of Tac
"* ma's sightseeing autos, or an ani
mal traiuer, or a motorcycle
rider.
Lis ambitions for a career nre
laid along those linen, at least.
He was Intercepted by Tiiej
Times reporter on his way lroni j
 the school house to the tidefl.its,
where, with one Walter Sic',;,
11 1:! Vis Tacoma ay., he had lanu
ed to celebrate tbe beginning of i
the school vacation by going
swimming.
Would Reveres Seasons
"Would you care to be quoted
concerning statements credited to
certain school officials in the
public press, in which they advo
cated school the year around.'"
young Mr. Walgraf was asked.
"Well, for m'self," said Wal
graf, "I hope ho gets canned tor |
ever mukin' such a statement: i
and besides, there ought to be |
nine months vacation and three
months of school."
The young gentleman was quite
decided about this.
"What would yon do If the leg
islature considered such a propo- *
t-ition?"
Forgotten Boyhood Hays
"The who?" I
"The stale legislature." i
"Oh, I'd be strong for askin'
the legislature where lie thinks
he's itettin' off at. It looks to t
me like certain folks have forgot
they ever was kids." i
The interview drifted toward a i
discussion of .Mr. Walgraf's plans
for the summer Qf l!)lfi. 1

spieler on a rubberneck car," he I
admitted, "and I wouldn't be I
Progressive Party
Dead; European War
Killed It-Gardner
By Gilson Gardner
WASHINGTON. l>. <"'.,
June 10.—The Kuropeuii
war has destroyed Ihe pro
gressive party of the Fulted
States.
The party has lieen sacri
ficed tn the demand for pre
paredness. This appears as
the one big fart looming up
in the wake of the republi
can and progressive conven
tions.
Roosevelt will not run as the
progressive candidate. At this
•writing he has not formally de
clined the nomination but he will.
The declaration of Charles K.
Hughes will satisfy his require
ments and Roosevelt will get be
hind Hughes to defeat the Wilson
administration.
Will anybody try to rally and
lead thi- remnants of the progres
sive party. A few days will de
termine finally the answer to this
question. At present the answer
Is: The party's banner lies
where it was flung—in the ditch.
* Leader May Arise
There is a possibility the stand
ard may be taken up by Hiram
Johnson of California or Victor
Murdock or Glfford Plnchot.
I have talked with these men
and feel that any one of them,
with sufficient encouragement,
" would go in and make the fight.
Perhaps the next few days will
yield the encouragement. Up to
date it has not appeared.
The "conscience" progressives
will divide their votes between

Says Water Is Fine
He said the swimming on the
flats is exceptionally fine, and
that it holds a high place in the
esteem of the Central school
sang.
"Starting tomorrow," said Mr.
Walgraf, "I'm goln' to get ■• at
4 o'clock In the niorntn'. A felfow
has got to get up early if he
wants to get an> fun out of vaca
tion. It don't seem like three
months until September conies."
Asked what he thought of the
grammar school work, as carried
on in Tacoma, he said:
Too Mim li Mathematics
"I consider the courses in our
school made up of too much math
ematics. Mathematics should be
cut out. We ought to have more
manual training.
"There should be more track,
baseball, football and other ath
letics. All boy pupils should get
football suits and be permitted
ta keep them."
the republicans, the democratic
and the socialist parties.
Members of the progres
sive national committee who
will have the power to
name a candidate belie.c any
candidate put* in the running
would poll i .noii,(itio votes.
The party polled 4,000,000
in 101*2.
This million votes might prove
to be the balance of power be
tween the old parties. Wilson
won last time by just about this
margain.
The most important result of
nainin-. a candidate would be the
perpetuation of the party aB a
mucins for future radical politi
cal action.
Progressives here have been
bitter in their crlticißin of Roose
velt. They feel he should have
notified them months ago if he
was not willing to be the candi
date ho they could have governed
themselves accordingly.
There Is another element which
sees in Roosevelt's course nothing
hut commendable self-sacrifice.
Derision June '20
They say he has shown conclu
sively that he places the country's
need above personal resentments
or even ambition, and is ready
not only to withdraw himself but
to do,all in his'power to with
draw not. only himself but also
his party when it stands in the
way of defeating the democratic
administration. ~
The truth is, Roosevelt has
from the beginning had only one
end in view, the election of a
president In place of Wilson com
mitted to the preparedness and
Americanism issues.
To accomplish this he would
ride down friends, ifiirty or any
other obstruction. '

Mr. Walgraf offered the infor
mation that he was a thorough
supporter of President Wilson's
policies, but that lie thought Mr.
Hughes would be elected.
He's v I'ucil'ist
'II am fully in accord with Mr.
Wilson because he is for peace,
and 1 do not wish to go to war,"
he said.
"But any man who can gradu

HARMONY
RIPS UP
A FAMILY
Mike Miller played a Victrola
so much that 10 years of smolder
ing jealousy welled up in John
Budiulck's henpecked heart und
he rebelled against his wife,
Amanda. It all terminated today
in the hearing of John's suit lor
a divorce in the superior court.
Mike was the etar boarder in
Rudinick's ituston home, it
seems. But according to Budi
nielc's broken testimony, the star
developed Into a whole constella
tion, and the first thing he knew
he was merely washing tlie dißltes,
while .Michael assumed first place
in the wife's heart.
The Victrola, which brought so
much grief to John's boul, was a
gift to his wife from Mike, who is
a boss at the smelter, drawing
down the wage of $:i.:!0 a day.
Budinick admitted on the
stand tliat his wife had him "buf
faloed" for 16 years, lie said he
did not object to the shoes and
the silk waists Miller gave his
wile because he did not ha\e the
courage.
"But when he gave her the
Victrola, il was 100 much,"
the tired husband com
plained. "Bran night they
would play it while I washed
the dishes for It) boarders.
"I got breakfast antl worked all
day in a sawmill and when I
would come home at night I had
to wash the dishes while my wife
went out to movies with tills man.
"I would hear her in his
room. One time I peeked through
the door and saw her sitting with
him, and she gave me thunder.
After that 1 did not dare go up
stairs when 1 heard them to
gether, but had to stay down and
wash the dishes."
Budinick claims his wife re
fused lo move to another house
unless Miller was allowed to live
witli them. During tlie 16 years
of married life lie clalmß he never
cashed a pay' check. This was his
wife's duty.
Once every week or so he
got 25 cents to go to a movie,

Kl'llKKA, Cal., June 16. -The

rocks at Plum's reef today, with
no immediate danger of breaking
up. Two hundred survivors are
going to San Francisco today on a
special train.
The accurate checking of the
| passengers is difficult. Tho com
pany asserts only five are dead.
Other versions gave five missing
as well as five dead.
The coroner is conducting an
inquest. Seamen believe if the
cargo is lightered the vessel will
float, and it will be possible to
save her.
Four bodies have been Identi
fied, but the fifth, a woman, la
difficult to Identify. The bodlea
were all smeared with oil, which
flowed from the burated tanks ot
the Bear and covered the sea.
The coroner suhpoensed Capt.
Nopandcr and several members of
the crew. Investigations showed
Ihe Bear was in no immediate
danger after striking the rocks.
Ho is Inclined to criticise tho
captain for ordering the passen

keeping them aboard. Joseph
