The fact that a Monday race will en
able autoists living in nearby cities
to drive to the meet on Sunday and
remain over on Monday influenced
them in arriving at their decision.
Until I can see them personally,
which I hope to do, I take this means
of expressing my warmest thanks to

CON-
REPUBLICAN NATIONAL
VENTION.
(Special to teh Bystander by Editor.)
Chicago, 111.—Stading in the great!
city of Chicago lat week and attend
ing the republican national republican
convention was indeed an inspiration
to any American citizen to- attend a
national republican convention ..when
the contest for presidency is sharp.
The great Coliseum was packed with
her thousands and thousands of re
publicans from Florida to Alaska and
from New York on the east to the
Hawaiian islands, and there were del
egates representing the Hawaiiana,
Alaska, Philippines, Indian, Negro and
the Anglo-Saxon. It was a harmoni
ous convention, seeking to unite the
divided party with the progressives,
which would insure victory this fall.
It was clearly demonstrated by the
convention that Theodore Roosevelt
Was the choice of the masses of peo
ple in Chicago, and even the visitors,
but the delegates and representative
men thought it best to nominate a
man acceptable to Theodore Roosevelt
and unite the two factors without an
tagonizing the conservative factor by
nominating Roosevelt. Therefore after
the second ballot the tidal wave turn
ed toward Judge Hughes of New York
and he was nominated on the second
ballot. Most all of the other candi
dates had withdrawn and Fairbanks
of Indiana was selected as his run
ning mate. The progressive conven
tion nominated Roosevelt and it was
understood that he will not accept the
nomination, but will support the re
publican nominee. Below we give a
list of the candidates nominated and
the amount of votes received on the
first ballot. There were about forty
delegates and about sixty alternates,
and several hundred colored visitors
and politicians present from all parts
of the United States,* including""the
newhpaper men and office holders and
those who hope to be office holders
were on the job.
