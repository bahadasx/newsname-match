Anger is aii emotion, and all emo
tions should be subservient to the
will. Keep the rising anger down by
the power of your will. Admitted
there are many things that cause
anger justifiable anger. Yet, now
that you know the scientific truth
that anger Is a killer of men, and
that every time you get into a blaz
ing rage you are pegging back the
tale of your years, is It worth while
to get angry?

ent of Sunday school work for the
New Hampshire and Vermont con
ferences, and Rev. R. F. Lowe,

Church.
The re-opening of the Methodist
church on the evening of June 12th
was an occasion which will not
soon be forgotten by those who had
the privilege to attend. After
months cf work, during which
about $ 1 300 has been expended,
all felt like rejoicing over the ac
complishment of what at first seem-
ed am impossible task. The new
steel ceiling, the new system of
lighting, the change on the walls,
the memorial windows, the paint
and new shingles on the exterior
make the edifice appear well-nigh
ike a new church.
Several speakers were listened
to with unusual interest and profit.
Rev. II. V. Hunter, the new pas
tor of the Methodist church at
Newport spoke upon "The Cross,"
showing that more than anything
else the cross is essential to the
ife of the church and - society.
After the audience had been enter
tained by a solo by Mrs. Chas. Le-
Bourveau, Geo. C. Robinson,
who has been a pillar in the church
ever since the local society came
into existence, gave a resume of
the history of the society, speaking
of its pastors and prominent lay
men. Mr. Robinson was followed
by Rev. W. S. Smithersof Orleans,
who was pastor of the local church
about thirty years ago. He men
tioned the changes that had occur
red during the years, spoke of the
pleasant memories of the past, and
emphasized the importance of
personal responsibility. Rev. V.
C. Chrystie, who left Island Pond
about two years ago, was also
heard with delight as he spoke
upon "The Hand of God." Rev.
R. F. Lowe, Superintendent of St.
Johnsbury district, pronounced
the benediction.
A good congregation attended.
Besides Mr. Robinson there were
a tew others 01 the old members 01
