Tax Law Interpretation.
(Rutland News.)
Some curious differences aro being
disclosed in tho various Vermont
towns in tho effects: of tho changes in
tho t :ix laws upon tho grand lists. In
I5ii ill n irt on the grand list dropped
over a million dollnrs, while in Hen
nington it increased nearly a hundred
thousand dollars. Probably if the work
wero compared, it would bo found that
in the "5u towns, more or less, in Vor
mont the tax laws wero interpreted
and udtninistered in approximately
'.'fil) different ways. How could it bo
otherwise, indeed, under our cumber
some system i It is passing strnugo
that an intelligent people will tolerate
such tin unfair nnd ridiculous method
of laying taxation.

WATCHING THE ROADS.
While it is travel that wears out n
road, very few people hnve nn idea
of the actual amount of travel on tiny
,'ivcn highway. I.ocnl officials some
times report that travel is heavy on a
ronil when not more than half n dozen
liyht vehicles pass a given point in
an hour. Sometimes they will report
travel as light when, tis a matter of
fact, the roads are lieing torn to pieces
ly a few heavy trucks engaged in con
tinuous service on tho roads. This
travel is really a very important fac
tor among the conditions that govern
the proper choice of the typo of con
struction for a road.
For instance, there was n well
known road in Massachusetts which
was put in a condition that served
admirably for tho quite nu.iicr-
cus carriages and automobiles then
using it. One summer it was no-
iced that it was going to pieces rapid
ly and the reason was sought. Finally,
iv making 21-hour counts of all tho
users of tho roads, it was found that
cry heavy wagons had recently been
put on the road to haul ice. Such
ravel required a modification in tho
onstrttction of the road, which was
mado when repairs became necessary
nnd resulted in returning the road to
ts satisfactory condition.
As no really satisfactory planning of
roads cnii bo done witboutdcfinito know
edge of tho use of them, many of tho
children in tho country sdhools of
Illinois aro now bcinc trained to
mnko enumerations of tho vehicles on
roads in their neighborhood, under
their teachers' direction, and tho
ounts aro sent to tho road ofllcinls.
ntelligent youths make excellent
ravel counters with a little training,
and local road improvement clubs will
do a very good work if thoy will fol-
ow tho Illinois plan and havo actual
ounts mndc of tho travel on their
roads. Such counts aro just as import
ant in road improvement as taking a
mnn's measure in tailoring.
THE REPUBLICAN CHOICE.
Tho Republican convention at Chi
cago last week adopted a platform in
inrniony with the traditions of the
mrty and better still it selected a true
and tried Republican to stand upon it.
Justice Charles K. Hughes is in no
sense a dark horse or an unknown. Ho
was not selected as a negative candi
date, a man of no opinion or a tracta
ble politician. Indeed, his force of
character and independence of thought
and his record for having strong con
victions wero doubtless tho main ob
stacles to his nomination on tho first
or second ballot. Some of tho political
leaders, especially those popularly
known ns the "old guard," feared that
with Hughes in the White Hottso they
might havo less political inlluenco than
they would like to enjoy. These men,
however, wero forced to bpw before an
irresistible popular demand, which was
apparent when the convention convened
and grow in intensity with each hour.
Justice Hughes acted with character
istic promptness on receipt of tho news
of tho Kepublienu convention's action
Ho nt once resigned ns justico of the
United States supreme court and then
forwarded to Chicago his nccoptanco of
the nomination. It was embodied in a
statement outlining his views on nn
tionnl issues a statement which is
vigorous nnd clear-cut, frank and nn
equivocal.
Vermont Republicans havo a right to
bo especially enthusiastic nbout the
Hughes candidacy for they wore among
the first to realize its possibilities and
tnko notion in accordance therewith
Whothcr or not tho Republican par
ty presents a united front in tho com
ing campaign depends ilnrgely upon tho
decision of Colonel Roosevelt with ro
gard to tho Progressive nomination
His conditional refusal to becomo the
cnndldato of that party for president
is generally beliovcd to forcenst his
eventual support of tho Republican
nominee, nnd if ho does tnko such nc
Hon thoro is good ground for belief
thnt Democratic control of affairs at
Washington will ceaso tho fourth day
of next March.
Whut enn be dono in building up
rundown farms in Now Englnnd is
shown by the experiences of C. E. Unl
die, of Kcnncbeck county, Me., who
Bomo years ago bought a farm in tho
suburbs of Wntcrvillo for $1,000. Ho
has slnco brought tho farm into a
high state of cultivation, great gullies
have been filled with rocks, stumps
and other refuse. Whnt was origin
ally but poor, rough lnnd is now in
profitable culture and tho farm is
worth $10,000. One thousand npplo
trees were set out, and arc now in
bearing. Over fiO tons of liny aro
raised per year, and a largo (tinntily
of vegetables and truck crops arc mar
keted by tho owner.
GUARDED HUSBAND'S BODY.
Insane Woman Refused to Allow Un
dertaker to Remove it for Burial,
threatening to Kill Him.
With a revolver, axe and knife with
in easy access, Mrs. Frank K. Wash
burn of Kcenc, X. H., who lived two
miles out of the city on Winchester
street, refused to let anybody remove
the body of her husband from the
house for burial after tho funeral Sun
day, saying alio would kill anybody
who undertook to take it away. It
was not until sho was induced "by an
ollicer to leave the house Monday nftor
noon thnt there was opportunity to
remove the body, and while that was
being dono papers were being made
out for Airs. Washburn 's commitment
to the state insane hospital in Concord.
She was in the insane hospital previous
to six years ago, when her husband se
cured her release.
She refused to havo any minister in
tho house for the funeral Sunday
morning at II o'clock, so tho service
was conducted by Heaver Hrook lodnc
of Odd Fellows, whom she allowed to
enter without protest.
At the dose ot the service Under
taker Harry X. Aldrich made prepara
tions to' remove the body, whereupon
MrH. Washburn exclaimed: ".Mr.
Washburn owns this house and he will
stay here." The undertaker tried to
persuade her to allow tho body to bo
buried, but sho was insistent and said
sho would kill him if he tried to re
move it. Relatives undertook to over
come tho woman's objections, but sho
was linn and mado it so unpicasant
that thoy left tho house. "This is a
funny funeral, isn't Hi" Mrs. Wash
burn said to somo of those present.
Tho peoplo finally withdrew and Mr.
Aldrich took counsel, but found thnt
ho had no right to take tho body by
lorce.
A nophew of Mr. Washburn said sho
had a revolver in tho pantry, nn axe
at tho head of her bod and a knito in
another place.
When the timo canio for taking
Mrs. Wnshbtirn to the state insane
hospital Mnndav night the officers ex
perienced no trouble in accomplishing
the task.
About .1.45 o'clock Lawrenco Gilbo,
acting city marshal in tho absilnco
of Marshal Philbrick, went to tho
Washburn home and rapped and Jlrs.
Washburn enmo to the door with tho
greeting, "Who aro you?" The offi
cer replied, "I am officer Gilbo,"
whereupon sho asked him to "come
right in."
Mrs. Washburn readilv consented
to .go to the police station, where she
was told thnt sho must go back to tho
iusano hospital at Concord. Sho did
not like tho idea, but made no trouble.
Judge of Probate Robert E. Rav had
the commitment papers made out
nbout li o'clock.
When everything was ready for the
start Officer Gilbo said to Mrs. Wash
burn: "Thoro is a big crowd out thero
by tho car and they think you aro
crazy, nnd yon want to fool them nnd
show them that you nro not by walk
ing straight up to tho car and getting
in." Tho unfortunate woman complied
with tho suggestion, nnd tho trip was
begun by automobile, Olhcor Swan
strom nnd John II. Pender accom
panying tho party. They reached Con
cord nbout midnight.
After Airs. Washburn had gono to
the police station Undertaker Aid
rich went to the Washburn home nnd
removed Mr. Washburn's body, which
was taken to Alstead, X. II., for buri
al, accompanied by relatives.
Mr. Washburn was peddling fish in
Dublin Thursday, June 8, and in
trying to overtake his horse, which
had started without command, he fell
dead of heart disease. lie was nbout
50 venrs old and left no children.
Mrs. Fred Lower, who lives next
door to tho Wnshburu house, wns ask
ed to notify Mrs. nshburn of her
husband-'s death, which sho did. In nn
instant Mrs. Washburn exclaimed: " If
ho is dead you killed him," and drove
her out of tho house.
RESTRAINS HEALTH BOARD.
Court Orders Vermont Officials to Show
Cnuso for Action.
A restraining order hns been served
on members of tho state board of
health in nn action brought in the
United states district court, in which
tho ofllcinls will bo asked to show
cauao why thoy should instruct cus
tomers of tho Albany Ice Crenm com
puny of Albany, X. Y., not to buy ico
cream which contains less than M per
cent butter fnt. The hearing will bo
held at Rrnttlcboro Juno 22.
It is understood tho state board of
health has det ns a standard for butter

Auction of 137 Head on Fair
Grounds Brought $28,920
First Salo in Brattleboro Under tho
Auspices of Purebred Live Stock
Sales Co. Avorago Was 5212.
The first of ho auction sales of tho
Purebred Live Stock Sales Co., Inc.,
of Urattleboro to be hold in Uiattlo
boro and the second under tlio man
agement of tho company, which be
gan Tuesday, came to a close late Wed
nesday afternoon on tho Valley fair
grounds in a whirlwind of bidding.
During tho last hour of the sale any
ono who really wanted an animal thut
was for salo was forced to speak
quick or lose his chance. Tho necessity
for hurrying undoubtedly had some
thing to do with keeping down tho
prices of the last lot of animals sold.
As it wns, the sales for the duv
totnlcd $17,400 for 73 cattle, an aver
age of a small fraction under $211
each for tho day's sales. The sales of
the first day amounted to $11,520 for
01 cattle, bringing tho total for tho
two days to $2S,!)20, an nverugo of
$212 each for 137 cattle. While it wns
probably a little disappointing that
there wns not u larger crowd present
there was no question of the interest
of those who were on hand. The big
majority wore men who were interest
ed in cattle and who know good cat
tle, und most of tiiem wero there to
buy if they could get what they
wanted for a price they considered a
fair one. The weather 'wns ideal fir
the snle, but coming as it did imme
diately after a long rainy spcjl it
forced ninny farmers who otherwise
would have been on hand to remain
at homo to do work that tho incle
ment weather had prevented them
from doing before.
F. II. Metcalf of Holyoke, Mass.,
who with his father operates tho big
Farr-Alpaca mills there, was the heav
iest buyer and paid the largest price

Henry R. Brown of Brattleboro was
one of two local buyers, paying $570

About 100 men and a few women
attended Tuesday morning and more
came at noon, l ittccn cattle wero dis
posed of that morning, 13 cows and
two calves, the latter only a tew days
old, and the average price was $100.
The cows averaged $171. F. II. Metcalf
