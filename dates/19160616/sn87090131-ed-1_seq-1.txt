THE WATCHMAKER OF MON.
TREUIL.
Monsieur Pel was not a popular
man in Montreuil. His neighbors
talked about him every day and shook
their heads gloomily when they did
so. Even the children hushed their
chatter when he went by, and it is re
lated to this day, by the old inhab
itants, that the dogs showed their
teeth and growled at the sight of him.
His habits and appearance were all
against him. For one thing, Pel would
have no traffic with his neighbors, fur
ther than to mend their watches and
clocks. He seemed to hate all man
kind. If the grocer or the notary bade
him good morning, Pel's answer
would be a wolfish snarl, and the gro
cer or the notary would mutter some
thing about the evil eye. If ever a
man had an evil face, that man was
Pel. His countenance was long and
ran down to a point; his nose was
hooked, and two little red, fiery eyes
glared with changeless hostility upon
all around him. His ears were large
and stuck out from his head like sails,
and his complexion was of the waxy,
bloodless hue of a corpse.
His business was watchmaking; but
his passion was chemistry, and all his
spare hours were spent in his house,
which presented a forbidding appear
ance. He had boarded up the lower
windows and the doors always were
barred and locked. He had a furnace
in the house, and often strange lights
of various colors and diabolical sug
gestion gleamed through the chinks in
the window boards, and passers-by
could hear the wheezing of bellows,
and the roaring of flames. At times
Pel never left his house for days to
gether, and then the fire always was
roaring. At other times he would ap
pear on the streets in sober black gar
ments, his chest covered with ribbons
and decorat ons-which he had made
himself. Then he would insist that
V '7.

Her Own Death Warrant.
he was a professor of the Sorbonne,
and that his chemical discoveries had
startled the world. A strange man was
Monsieur Pel; so strange that he was
sent to a lunatic asylum once and re
mained there for a year or two, after
which experience he resumed his
watchmaking and his chemical experi
ments.
It was thirty odd years ago that a
woman named Elise Boehmer con
sented to accept a situation as house
keeper in the Pel establishmedt. This
was just after the watchmaker's sec
ond wife and her mother had made a
sudden and mysterious exit from the
house. The second wife and her moth
er were wretchedly ill when this hap
pened, and they remained in the
neighborhood only long enough to re
cuperate suficiently to travel. They
were not communicative. The most
they would say was. that they thanked
God they had got away from that
house alive.
This circumstance increased the un
popularity of Pel. What was going
on in his house, that two women
talk that way?
The friends of Elise Boehmer tried
to persuade her not to take the Job.
It would be far better for her to work
herself to death as a charwoman than
to be associated in any way with a
man who certainly was in league with
the powers of darkness. But Elise
laughed at such advice. She had a
mind of her own. The mystery of the
Pel home attracted her. Moreover,
she was a big, strong woman, and the
watchmaker was thin and frail, and
it he attempted say funny business
C
she would show him dhnt wiswhi$.
Elise had been thrtft in ta e says
of her life, and had a msat little pack
age of francs put awayitbr thi ranay
day. No sooner had als begun oi
Ing for Pel than he beat borrowing
her money. He was egasl in an ex
periment which would make him rich,
and everything she loaaed him would
be repaid a hundredfold. After mak
ing several loans she concluded ,that
the security was too shadowy, and she
refused to loosen up any more. Pal
glared at her with his wicked red
eyes and told her that she was read
igg her own death warrant.
.For many hours after this Pei's
furnace fire raged furiously. Black
smoke belched from his chimmay In
a steady stream, and at night a red
glare streamed from the. chlns, in
the window boarding. It happened
that a young man of the neighborhood
confessed to curiosity as hils chief
weakness, and his curiosity ovettame
his fear to such an extent that he got
a ladder, and quietly placed it against
Pel's boarded window; then he
climbed up and had a good view, over
the top of the boards, of the Interior
ýf the house.
The neighbors waited at a distance,
marveling at the boldness of the young
man, and praying that he might return
alive. He did. He came back to
them and told them, in a sobbing
whisper, that he had seen more than
he expected to see. Pel was stoking
his furnace furiously and anon throw
ing strange fuel into It. The young
man was sure that this fuel was frag
ments of a human body. Moreover,
there were prints of hands on the
wall, and these prints looked as
though they might be in blood.
Nothing was done until morning,
and then the officers went to the
house. Pel's fire had gone out, and
there was a heap of white ashes in
the furnace. But there was plenty of
evidence that a great crime had been
committed, and that Elise Boehmer
had been destroyed. Pel was taken
to jail, where he told one lie after
another, trying to explain the wom
an's disappearance. Then there ap
peared at the police station a woman
who said that she had called at Pel's
house to see Ellse Boehmer. and had
found her alone and in convulsions.
Elise evidently was dying, and the
woman hurried away, and kept what
she had seen to herself, so great was
her fear of the watchmaker. It was
then suspected that Pel had poisoned
Elise, and, after her death, dismem
bered the body and burned it. This
proved to be the case, and the enorm
Ity of thie crime has given the red
eyed watchmaker a conspicuous place
in the chronicle of bloody deeds.
While France was simmering with
excitement over this grotesque crime,
further revelations increased that ex
citement. Somebody remembered that
various women who had been so un
fortunate as to become associated
with Pel had died or disappeared sud
denly and mysteriously; and it was
recalled that Pel often had boasted of
the discovery of a poison which left
no traces. His first wife had died
some years before, and the doctor had
oredited her death to the eating of
poisonous mushrooms. Investigation
showed that she had died of poison.
This was bad enough, but worse was
to follow. Another doctor remembered
that he had treated Pel's mother for
a similar complaint and she had died.
The mother's body was disinterred,
and experts decided that she had died
of poison. It was soon made evident
that the Inhuman wretch had killed
his own mother to get possesalon of
the little property she owned, which
he could not touch while she lived.
Then it was rememberd that two
girls who had gone to work for Pel,
in 1872 and 1873, had disappeared and
were seen no more, after a short serv
ice with him. There could be no
doubt that they had met the fate of
Elise Boehmer. or something similar,
but no great effort was made to trace
the facts in these cases.
Pel was tried at the Melun as
sizes, and a distinguished French au
thor who was there wrote of the pris
oner: "Those eyes never looked
straight at anyone, that shriveled
mummy face surely never smiled, that
impenetrable mask had had no youth."
The murderer was convicted, but -
was only sentenced to transportation k
for life, probably because of grave i
doubts as to his sanity.
Their Way. ti
"My wife's bills have a queer way i
of doing."
"How do you mean?"
"The more she contracts them the
more they expand."
