tion, finished Its draft of a platform
at 8 o'clock to-day and authorized
Senator Stone, its cnairman, to pre
sent the document to the convention.
Few changes were made in the ten
tative platform as drawn by its sub
committee of nine, but the night was
spent in discussion of the phraseology
of some of the more important planks,
especially those of Americanism,
woman suffrage and Mexico.
At 11 o'clock the hour for the final
session of the Democratic convention
to begin there were not more than 200
delegates in the Coliseum and the
seats were filling slowly. The first
gallery rows were tilled but there were
no crowds around the doors.

son of St. Louis there was a lull in
the proceedings pending the report of
the platform committee. Senator

fill in the time.
In response to a request from dele
gates to fix the time and place for
notification of President Wilson and
Vice-President Marshall of their re
nomination, Chairman Jones explain
ed that it was the plan to confer first
with the candidates.
The burden of Reed's speech was
■sin attack on the nomination of Mr.
Hughes be ause he was taken from
the Supreme Court bench.
"America" was played by the band
when Senator Reed concluded and
while Chairman Stone of the Resolu
tion committee to the platform to
present the platform. Senator Stone
looked haggard from his long vigil.
In introducing Senator Stone to
present the platform Chairman James
asked for order to hear "the Demo
cratic declaration of faith." Senator
Stone was given prolonged applause.
"Oh, you Bill," a spectator shouted
at him as he began.
Describing the committee's labors
as "somewhat protracted and ardu
ous," Senator Stone made a brief in
troductory address.
"I am not going to read it," said he
referring to the platform. "1 have not
been able to sleep a moment in more
than 30 hours."
Chairman Stone delegated the read
ing to Senator Walsh, of Montana, and
Senator Hollis.of Montana. Senator
Walsh took the speaker's stand first
and began reading at 12.36 o'clock.
Spectators Quit lily Tire
The first applause given the plat
form was for the endorsement of the
administration. The delegates gave
close attention. Before Senator Walsh
had finished the preamble spectators
in the galleries began to leave and
the noise made it difficult for dele
gates to hear.
Endorsement of the Underwood tar
iff act was given general applause.
The delegates seemed to interrupt
with lengthy applause.

I*£ISS JOSEJPHIKE- DAVIS ©//V7t . s&Zr/cR
Snapshot of Josephine Davis made as she left the courtroom in Wau
kegan. 111. T'ne assertion by Josephine Davis that her chum, Marian Um
bert, had declared io her that if Will Orpet gave her up she would kill her
self is believed by observers to have seriously undermined the State's case
against Will Orpet. charged with the murder of Miss Lambert.
Although the revelation of a suicide threat came near being a death
blow to the prosecution, "Jo" Davis testified to a fact about which the State
may be able to weave a mesh of evidence against Orpet. The chum of the
dead girl said that after January Marian had told her that she was all right
physically and that she had nothing to worry about.
The defense has contended that worry over her physical condition may
have led Marian Lambert to eommjj suicide. It was Intimated in letters that
passed between Orpet and Miss Lambert that Orpet did not know of this
change and that he went to the fatal tryst ignorant of the fact that Marian
had no disgrace to face. This left the State with their most important mo
tive intact—the allegation that Orpet feared that Marian's disgrace, if her
condition became known, would ruin his chances of marrying Miss Youker.
