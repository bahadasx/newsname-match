Ptak Adopted at St Lods
8t Louis, Juns 16.The complete
naroioay. program of th democratic
, national, convention u "busted
ild open" today.
' Harmony reached lu climax near
. midnight when President Wilson tad
Vice-President Marshall were re
nominated by acclamation.
At 7 o'clock, when the resolutions
oommittec wu potting tit finishing
touches on its report, after 2S hours
continuous session, It wa apparent
that at leut on flgbt of that long
grind would be carried to the floor of
th conventioa.
This wss In relation to woman suf
frage. The committee fought out the
equal ballot pledge for hours. It de
feated, 10 to II, plank for a
straight-out declaration la favor of a
federal eonititutlon amendment to
glra woman the Tote. , It adopted br
' a Tot of IS to lo the following state
ment: ; :'tt? ' i
"We reeonuoead taUxtln of
the franchise to the women of the
country by the atatet, upon the tame
terms aa man."
This lobetltute waa entirely un
satisfactory to the auffrage workera.
The workera for a atralght-out suf
frage endorsement were Indignant
and openly voiced their declaration
-of offering from the floor a aubatltut
Which would commit the party to
open and complete accord In a con
stitutional amendment granting ex
tension of tha ballot.
The language of the Mexican
plank and of that referring to the
democratic' foreign policy were alio
stumbling blocke with the auffrage
resolution.
The convention, Id the night tea
talon, which adjourned at 11:80 a, m.
today, plainly showed it waa weary
of further delay anxious to finish
up and go home. ; That feeling was
even mora pronounced when the dele
rates awoke with sore throats or ach-
ing arma and legs from the over-use
they gave such , organa and parts In
, last night's outburst of cheering and
' noise accorded President Wilson and
his running mate,
Outside all the police reserves had
to be called to quell a riot of disap
pointed spectators. There was con
siderable crltlclam of the police to
day Tor their utter refusal to recog
nise credentials of national commit
teemen, delegates or newspaper men
In this throng outside. Many with
full credentials were even roughly
, handled.
Some dolcgates had smuggled In
their friends without tickets early,
and the overflow ran into the preBS
stands and the aisles, thus .packing
the, convention hnll with many with
out credentials. , ' '

In .the platform submitted' to. the
democratic national committee today
by a ' resolutions committee that

Woman's auffrage, one of the prin
cipal bones of contention, waa held
to ba a state lasue and not one for
decision by a constitutional amend

It was a lengthy document.
Twenty-flve "planks" constltited It,
and democracy's "pointing with
pride," promises, pledges for the fu
ture and endorsement of the put
were limned in about MOO words.
The platform held "revolting" the

New York, June 16. That Charles
B. Hughes, republican candidate tor
the presidency, will soon have. a con
terence with Theodore Roosevelt was
the belief today of men identified

lowed on the heels of a rumor, eman
ating on the Roosevelt stde, that the
colonel would see Hughes tonight.

Roosevelt expects to etay in town

Those! responsible for the news

London, June 16.- With Czerno-

the Russian offensive is now driving
westward toward 8tnlslau, In an
effort to completely cut the Aua-
triana' , communications between
Lemberg and the southern points of
the line, if the Russians are success
ful, the Austrian Cxernowits army
either will have to stand its ground
or retreat through the eastern end of
the Carpathlana and down the plains
of Hungary. For the Russians to
reach and occupy the rich farming
country of the plains would be a
serloua blow to the central powers,
now practically dependent upon the
coming harvest for enough food to
enable them to continue the war. .

Vienna all make patent . that , the
