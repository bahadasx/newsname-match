feel sure it must be. You are sure
ly doing a good work.

,'the way to build up a successful
town.. You are getting reaults
that could be accomplished in no
other way.
"Let the good work go on and
wishing you the greatest of suc
cess, I am,
' "Yours truly,

LORDSRURG 6 TUCSON 3
Still maintaining their fine rec
ord of only on defeat this sea
son, the Lordsburg athletes walk
ed away with the game Sunday
afternoon whereby the Espee base
ballists were opponents. The fin
al tab was 6 and 3, the locals car
rying off the big number. The
game was the best yet played on
the Lordsburg lot and gave the
fans something to talk about un
til the middle of the week. Ev
eryone was pleased with the show
ing made by the townsmen and the
S. P. boomers from Dryland.
McMeans did the Matthewson
stunt for Godsburg while the ter
rible Dean (the same one who
heaved for ua against Clifton) whs
the human catapault for Tucson.
McMeans had to his credit four
teen strikeouts and played an all
around good game. Dean was not
far behind and gave a good exhi
bition. With heavier support he
would have stood better chances
of winning the game.
In the fifth spasm the score
stood 2 to 0 with the 2 in Two-scon.
,(Joke). It looked bad for Lords
burg. Then In the fifth round
the local gang put across three
winners, and there was great re
joicing. Selah. Two more were
credited LdTdsburg in th sixth
and one in the seventh. Tucson
came back with one lonesome little
run in the ninth.
Pete Foley umpired till the fifth
and then took the recall. Plumber
Peacock did the score-keeping and
was held up by some rummie who
took the score book back to Tucson
with him hence the Liberal's lack
of minute details.
The Tucson line-up was com
posed of: Francis catcher, Dean
pitcher, Kengla first base, Hoff
second base, Danis shortstop, Mc
Dole third base, Regeser, right
field, Osgood, center field, Alber
bede, lefj; field.
Lordsburg put out on deck: Mc
Means pitcher, Archuleta catcher,
Egon first base, Williams second
base, Barela shortstop, Randall
third base, Diaz right field, Mar
salfs center field, Kerr left field.
The Tucson players came up on
No. 2 Sunday afternoon accom
panied by a large number of root
ers. They had a great time while
here and were royally entertained
by the local ball players and rail
road boys. .
Those subscribing amounts to
the support of the baseball club
are asked to deposit their subscrip
tion with the 1st National Bank to
the credit of the baseball associa
tion. At last audit the team had
$5 balance with enough debts to
give Carnegie a pain in the, pocket
book. Lordsburg isn't going to let
baseball die out this season. There
aren't that kind of sporty here.

II. J. McGRATH
WILL RE CANDIDATE
FOR RE-NOMINATION
The several thousand friends of
II. J. McGrath in this section were
pleased this week when formal an
nouncement was made that he
K.would be' a candidate for rennm-
ination for the office of Sheriff on
the Democratic ticket.
It is needless for any person in
Grant county to be informed of
the efficiency of Mr. McGrath in
his capacity of Sheriff. A clear
record speaks for itself.
Being a resident of southern
Grant county and especially fa
miliar with the country surround
ing his home and down to the
Mexico border, he will be one of
the strongest candidates on the
Democratic ticket. As a business
man Mr. McGrath has been most
successful, and a business head
is needed in the office of sheriff.
Southern Grant county has en
couraged Sheriff JVIcGralh to be
a candidate for renomination, and
the Democrat;! stand ready to a
man to support him.
DEAN ALEXANDER
FOR TREASURER
The Western Liberal this week
carries the first of of its political
announcements, being that of
Dean Alexander for treasurer and
collector, subject to the approval
of the Democratic party.
Mr. Alexander is especially qual

connected with the office faithful
ly for a number of years. In speak
ing of his candidacy Mr. Alexan
der says: "I am out for the nom
ination for the reason that I be
lieve that I am entitled to promo
tion, having more than served my
apprenticeship. There is no need
of my telling that if elected the
office will receive my undivided
attention, and am sure that I am
the only one of the prospective
candidates that intends to pursue
that course. Also I believe that I
can serve the public a great deal
better by having the office myself
than by working as a deputy..
Many people in southern Grant
county have expressed their de
light it the announcement of Mr.
Alexander, believing him to be ef
ficient and the man for the office,
besides being a strong factor on
the Democratic ticket.
