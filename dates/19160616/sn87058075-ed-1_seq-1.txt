OFFICIAL PAPER OF THE CITY AND COUNTY
fcpts*CWrek.
THE HOME MERCHANT
f|: The home merchant. Who is he?
He is the chap who gives you credit when you are financially broke,
"and carries your account until you are able to pay.
He is the chap who gives you back your money or makes exchanges
when you are not satisfied with what you have bought.
He is the chap who stands behind his guarantee, and makes restora
tion of all losses that you may sustain on the goods you buy.
He is the chap who meet3 you at the door with a handshake, and
lets you out with a message to the "kids," and a real, come again good
bye.
He is the chap who meets and greets you on the street every day in
the year, and takes a neighborly interest in your family and your
affairs.
He is the chap whose clerks and bookkeepers and other employees
live in your city and spend their money with you and with other city
people.
He is the chap who pays heavy taxes to help support your citv
schools, and build your streets, and maintain your fire departments and
police departments and parks, and lighting and water service.
He is the chap who helps support your city churches and hospitals
and charity organizotions, and your lodges and commercial clubs, and
talks for your city and boosts for your city every day in the year.
He is the chap who visits you when you are sick, sends flowers
your family when you die, and follows your bodv out amnne the trees
and tombs, as far as human feet may travel with the dead.
He is the home merchant—your neighbor—your friend—your helper
in times of need.
Don't you think that you ought to trade with him and he his friend
and his helper in the time of his need
Don't you know that every dollar that you send out of vour city for
merchandise, is sent to strangers—to men who never spend a dollar in
your citv. to nen who would not trust you for a box of matches, to men
who would turn you over to the police if yon should enter their offices
You don't save much, frequently nothing, when you send your
money out of your city a you take all of the risk yourself of short
weight or measure and of getting damaged or inferior goods. And
don't you know that the growth and prosperity of your city depends
very largely upon the success and prosperity of the home merchants?
Out-of-town people judge your city by the appearance of your stores
and the degree of enterprise «howii Ijy yonf merchants.'~And our home
merchants cannot succeed unless home.folks give them loyal support.—
