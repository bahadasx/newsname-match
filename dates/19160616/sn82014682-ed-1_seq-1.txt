brate It was feasible. "Coming

get back heme just about in time
to advise their friends to come
over here for, the Carnival .
He pointed out that the Kame
hameha dynasty has its day" in
which all the people do It honor,
and said that the Kalakaua dyn
asty was worthy of a similar rec
ognition. Then he suggested that
members cf the cabinet of the
merry monarch," many of whom
are still prominent in the life of
Hawaii, get together and form an
organization similar to the Kame
hameha Day celebration commit
tee to arrange a program for'Ka
lakaua Day, November 16. If this
Is done, he added, the Chamber

cooperate by asking the : mer
chants and business houses to
