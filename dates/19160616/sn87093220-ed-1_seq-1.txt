DA YLABOR IS
DECREED FOR
BIG PIPE LINE
Council Comes to Deci
sion at Last on Water
Project
The Wishkah water project is to
go through, most likely with a dash
now; and certainly by the labor of
citizens of Aberdeen. The latter
clause was insured by Wednesday
night's action of the city council in
adopting the resolution, introduced by
Councilman John W. Praser, provid
ing that all bidi? for construction of
the water system be rejected and
that the city dr> V ork, itself, by
day labor.
The couple oi liours following Fra
ser's introductory argument made
history in the council chambers. It
needed not E. E. Wieland's declara
tion that the water project was the
biggest thing ever attempted by an
Aberdeen city council; nor the em
phasis laid on the vastness of the
work by other speakers. The audi
ence knew all about the magnitude
of the job. Parenthetically, it might
be observed, every councilman and
the mayor, Wednesday night, talked
straight at the audience. It was not
their colleagues whom they were en
deavoring to convince. It was the
spectators whom they desired to as
sure of their rectitude of purpose,
seemingly. There were no excep
tions, save McMaster. He didn't peep
once until roll call and then the roof
of the council chambers quivered
with the assault upon the murky, to
bacco laden atmosphere by the lungs
of several hundred men.
Which argument was most effective
in persuading McMaster must re
main matter of doubt. Maybe he
didn't need any persuading, although
there were 11 anxious councilmen,
OJQt to mention the mayor, and not
ilfttflude to the hoi polloi in the
MjHHbers, who were casting, wistful,
Hy glances at the Sixth ward
■Hp.'ilman long before City Clerk
pNfir F. Clark reached his name in
■bwever, so fast is the wheel, his
*jr has been made since Tuesday
ktAt's mass meeting of citizens and
i 'MBnesday night's council session,
in the less than 4S hours since,
! has become ancient. The
>itt>Uc, now, is waiting for the actual
w'Ork on the project to start.
Two Nights of Action
To epitomize: Tuesday ni?ht saw
a mighty good representation of busi
ness men assembled in mass meet- >
ing. and a handful of workingmen.
The council learned the wishes of
the majority at that meeting, for a
contract to be let for construction of j
the Wishkah water project; and
learned, too, the wishes of the minor- |
Ity for the following ot the original
plan of doing the work by day labor.
Wednesday night the scale swung

The 130 th birthday of tlio nation

and citizens, afoot and in autos, was
an inspiring sight. In the theater

fices discontinued during the previous
three years, etc.

ABERDEEN. WASHINGTON. FRIDAY, JUNE 16, 1916.
HERE THEY ARE, TAKE
A GOOD LOOK AT THEM
TWO GREAT AND GOOD MEN, STANDARD BEARERS FOR
BOTH NATIONAL PARTIES.
If you vote, you will have to vote for one or the other. Take abso
\
lutely no notice of what a lot of old ward heelers, yawps, pie-eaters
t
and pap suckers have to say, butjust think it over carefully and
thoughtfully, then whichever man and party you wish to entrust this
great nation, at this critical crisis to, go in and vote for him.
No need to rant about, upset business or ballyho around, it is a
clean, clear cut proposition, Republican or Democrat. Bear in mind that
this country does not hold two greater men nor men better fitted for
the position. But above all put mere party feeling away from you and
vote for your own and your country's welfare and may the best man
win and the the hearty support of every person in the U. S.
Support of our country must always be superior to and above our sup
port of any party in it.

PREPAREDNESS TO BE FEATURE OF PARADE
SPLASH WILL INCORPORATE MONSTER DEMONSTRATION IN
PROGRAM ON FOURTH OF JULY
The last big feature, to be planned
by the Moose committee which lias
charge of the Fourth of July Splash,
is a great preparedness parade as the
star event of the program on the
Fourth. If the city, through expres
sions from lodges and other organiza
tions, from business and professional
men, from men and women generally,
backs up the idea, there will be a
monster preparedness parade on that
day.

FOR MEETING
LONGSHOREMEN
AND SHIPPERS
STILL OPPOSED
With Opening of Third Week of
Strike There Seems Little
Chance for End
With the big longshoremen's strike
advanced two days in its third week,
there seems still but a slight chance
of its settlement in tlte near future.
Both sides to the fight apparently
have made up their minds to a long
struggle. Secretary Jack Axon of the
Longshoremen's union and Hugh De
lanty, manager of the Grays Harbor
Stevedore company, declare for strik
ers and employers, respectively, so
far as the Harbor situation is con
cerned, that they have no more pro
posals to make other than those made
at the outset. *
LOCAL SCHOOLS
CLOSE YEAR OF
FINE PROGRESS
A remarkably fine year in the school
life of our city has just closed, har
mony has prevailed throughout and
great progress has been the result.
The mothers and fathers of the pu
pils and scholars have taken more
interest in the various schools than
ever before, and the visitors to the
schools, not including special days,
has reached as high as 1920, two or
three times as many as in former
years.
The total enrollment in 1915 was
2045, in 1916 2187. The average
daily attendance in 1915 was 1674. in
1916 1703. The school census in 1915
was 2659, in 1916 2811. The high
school attendance during 1915 was
35,437, in 1916 43,455. Total attend
ance for all city schools in 1915 was
305,407, in 1916 307, 955.
Aberdeen is proud of her schools,
and is* most liberal in their support;
the people look for efficiency and re
sults. ancl this report shows they ob
tain it.
E. C. Finch returned last Sunday
from a trip East, with a firm convic
tion that the spirit of optimism that
he found there, the result of a full
measure of prosperity, is bound to
extend here soon. It will not be long,
says Finch, before the • Pacific Coast
wheels of industry will be turning as
rapidly as they are turning in the
East.

I Grays Harbor County W.
| C. T. U. Holds Big >
Convention
The Grays Harbor County \V. C.
T. U. held its twenty-third annual
convention, Tuesday and Wednesday
at Montesano. An Interesting session
was the result, with a number of live
addresses, most of them being perti
nent to the main question before -the
convention, that of bringing about a
"saloonless nation."
Mrs. French, county president, In
her annual report, said that a saloon
less nation in 1920 did not seem Im
probable now. She said the Union
was very happy over the working ot
the present law, but that it was not
satisfied and was not going to bo
satisfied so long as liquor could be
shipped into the state.
All the last year's officers were re
elected, as follows:
Mrs. C. Belle French, president;
Flora C. Wartman, vice president;
Nina Calder, corresponding secretary;
Carrie E. Mills, recording secretary,
and Sarah E. Myers, treasurer.
There was great interest in the
gold medal oratorical contest. The
medal was won by Richard Trask,
son of Mr. and Mrs. R. G. Trask.
MAY SHIPMENT
OF LUMBER BY
RAIL IS HEAVY
While exact statistics are not yet
available, it is authoritatively stated
by local railway officials that ship
ments of lumber by rail from Grays
Harbor in May were larger than for
any one month in many years. The
longshoremen's strike, naturally,
would not interfere yet with rail ship
ments.
AUTO GOES OVER
BANK, NONE HURT
Death was narrowly escaped last
Sunday by Harry Druximan and fam
ily, when their automobile plunged
over a 30-foot bank at the Hump
tulips railroad bridge, 14 miles west
of Hoquiam. Druximan sustained a
wrenched knee, but the others la
the party received nothing but slight
scratches and bruises.
TACOMA TOO HUSKY
Elks lodge of Tacoma came down
to Aberdeen last Sunday and played
the local Elks lodge baseball and golf,
winning in both. The baseball game's
score was 15 to 8; the golf match,
23 to 17.
