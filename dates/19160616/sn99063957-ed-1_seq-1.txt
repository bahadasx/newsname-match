Ceorge L. Blair, general manager of

Ijsion at Eureka.
The two lifeboats which capsized
were caught broadside to the surf
and rolled over. All the occupants
wore lifebelts and people ashore- threw
ropes and helped them land, but the
five that' pef Ished were unable to keep
tiioir heads above water even with the
aid of Uie lifebelts. Their corpses
floated ashore almost as ntiicklv as
tlie survivors swam there. Ono of the
upsets. was said to have, been caused
ly a passenger's dog jumping ovei

knocked one of the oars from its lock
aud allowed the boat to turn sideways
to the breakers.
When' they readied the strand the
passengers were obliged to bun- them
selves in . the sand for warmth. Later
t'jey were taken to the ranch houses.
Most of the passengers, who were
taken to Eureka in the tug' Relief and
the steamer Grace Dollar, started for
Sni Francisco this morning over the
Northwestern Pacific railroad at 8:15
o'clock. Survivors who reached Cape
town were taken aboard at Ferndale.
Survivors told many thrilling stories
of heroism in the face of grnve dan-
tier when the Bean- struck the reef.
I'assenaers rushed on deck in their
flight clothes, but were sent back by
the captain to dress. When the life
boats upset one woman saved her

The Bear is still hard and fast on
Blunt 's Reef today and it is feared
tlie will be a total loss. Captain No-

Record of Achievement.
Tho endorsement of the administra

itself. It is the best exposition of sound
democratic policy at home and abroad.
We challenge comparison of our rec

constructive legislation with those of

We found pur country hampered by
sueci.il tiriviWe. a vicious tariff, obso-
lete banking laws and an inelastic
currency.
Our 'foreign affairs were dominated
by commercial interests for their selfish
ends. The republican pary, despite re
peated pledges, was impotent to correct
abuses which at had fostered. Under
our administration, under a leadership
which has never faltered, these abuse
have been corrected ami our pople

men of America, and secure for them
a coutiuued period of quiet, assured and
confident prosperity.
Tariff.
We reaffirm our belief iu the doc
trine of a tariff for the people of pro
viding sufficient revenue for the opera
tion of the government economically ad
mini.ored and unreservedly endorse the
Underwood tariff law as truly exempli
fying that doctrine. We recognize that
tariff rates are necessarily subject to
change to meet changing conditions in
the worlds productions and trade. The
events of the last two
brought about many
years have
momentous
changes. In some respects their effects
are yet conjectural and wait to be
closed, particularly in regard to our
foreign trade. Two years of a war
whiclf has directly involved most of the
ci.icf industrial nations of the world and
which directly affected the life and in
dustry of all nation 4, are bringing
about economic changes more varied
and far reuching than tho world has
ever before experienced.

It Was All Over Four
Minutes to Midnight
Coliseum, St. Louis, June 10. The
convention in last night's session,
plainly showed it was weary of furtiier
delay anxious to finish up and go
home. . Thnt feeling was even more
pronounced when the delegates awoke
with sore throats or aching arms and
legs from the over use they ?ave such
organs and parts in last night's out
burst of cheering and noise accorded
President Wilson and his running
mlate. Democracy's convention his
tory, with the climax four years ago
ut Baltimore, has recorded many a
stirring night session, but seldom any
more picturesque than, last eight's
meeting. A tremendous crowd took
every inch of space iu the great audi
torium and remained until both Wil
son and Marshall had been nominated.
Outside all tho city police reserves
had to be called to quell a riot of dis
appointed spectators. There was con
siderable Criticism of the police today
for their utter relusal to recgnizts cre
dentials of national committeemen del
egates or newspapermen in this throng
outside: ' Many ' With' full "credentials
were even roughly handled. Jjoor
keepers with large circles of acquaint
ances had smuggled in their friends
without ticket and they overflowed
everywhere in press stands, clinging
to the railings, sitting in the aisles and
perched on window ledges.
Fire Department Takes Charge
Before the convention was called to
order the coliseum was so full that the
fire department took charge of the
entrance and permitted no more to
come in. William .1. Bryan, However,
managed to get by and got his usual
uproarious reception as he tk his
seat.
At 9:1.1 o'clock Chairman James
rapped the convention to order. The
Kev. W. J. Hardest.?, ennpinu or. ine
Missouri senate, offered a prayer.
The crowd yielded to the rasping of
the gavel long enough to hear the
prayer und then renewed its demands
tor" a speech from Bryan. Chairman
James admonished the galleries.
Senator Thompson then moved a sus
pension of the rules to permit lur.
Bryan to speak, wnne tne morion was
put there were Borne "noes," but the
chairman ruled two-thirds had voted
in favor.
A committee headed by Senator
Kern, of ludinna, escorted Mr. Bryan
to the speaker's place, while tho floor
and galleries roared their approval.
Senator Hughes, of New Jersey, act
ed in the role of an officer of one of
the entrances, aiding the police in try
ing to control the crowd.
While Mr. Bryan wus spenking word
came in from time to time of leaders
marooned outside and of more than
200 delegates who could not enter.
Reselling parties of officers went out
aud not them inside. Norman K Mack,
the uatiinal committeeman from New
York, and Charles F. Murphy, leader
of Tammany, were among those who
struggled for neurly an hour to gain
recognition beforo getting through the
lines.
Marooned Delegates Rescued
Chairman .Ijitics directed the poli
to go to the entrances and ndmit all
delegates, alternates ami members of
the press marooned outside.
Then the roll of the states was call-
d for nominations. Alabama yielded
to New Jersey, and Judge John W.
Wescott began his speech nominating
President Wilson.
Applause was given to Judge Wes
cott' remarks on the administration 's
policy toward Mexico. The crowd wijs
attentive and quiet. It voiced approval
of America's maintenance of interna
tional law. Some of the crowd, how
ever, were eager for the nomination.
"ame him, name liin, came cries
from the galleries.
An Judge Wescott closed with a
mention of the name "Woodrow Wil

demonstration. Moving picture flash
lights blazed, and flags were paraded

while a huge bnnner bearing the presi
dent's likeness was unfurled from the

(United Press staff correspondent.)
St. Louis, Mo., June 10. The com
plete harmony program for the demo
cratic national convention was "bust
ed wide open" today. Harmony reach
ed its climax near midnight when
President Wilson und Vice-Presideut
Marshall were re-nominated by acclama
tion. At 7 o'clock, when the resolutions
committee was putting the finishing
touches on its report after 22 hours
continuous session, it was appnreut that
at least one fight of that long grind
would be carried, to the floor. of. the
convention; ' : .'
This was in relation to woman stf
frago. The committee fought out the
equal ballot pledge for hours. It defeat
ed, 20 to 2, a plunk for a straight
out declaration in favor of a federal
constitutional amendment to give wo
men the vote. It adopted by a vote' of
2u to 20, the following statement::
"Wo recommend the extension of the
franchise to the women of the country
by the states, upon the same terms is
men." .
This substitute was entirely nnsatis
factory to the suffrage workers. It was
regarded by them as a mere, subterfuge
a "passing of the buck" to the
states. The workers tor a straight out
suffrage endorsement were indignant
and openly voiced their declaration of
offering from the floor n substitute
which would commit the party to open
and complete accord in a constitutional
amendment granting extension of the
ballot.
Committee Won Out.
It was o motley crowd of politicians
and statesmen who wound up their plat
form building early this morning. The
room on the second floor of the Planters
hotel in which they met was a sight to
behold. Its floor was littered with
dead and stale cigar stumps, with pa
per, mutches and debris; the air hung
heavy in the bright morning sunlight
with the smell of sweaty bodies and
putrid cigar smoke. Members of the
resolutions committee themselves were
frazzled tlieir eyes rimmed with red
from the long tense debute, their faces
lined with deep wrinkles oi exhaustion
and their voices hoarse with excitement
and straining in tho constant argument
and debates. Nobody's temper actual
ly broke down, but there were some
near casualties. Not since 7 o'clock last
night hus either Senator Hollia of New
Hampshire, nor Senator Walsh of Mon
tuna, left the room iu which committee
met.
The language of the Mexican plank
and of that referring to the democratic
foreign policy were also stumbling
blocks with the suffrage resolution.
There may be nil open uiring of these
differences from the floor of the con
vention when the break comes on wo
man suffrage.
Old timers in democratic ranks were
actually pleased with the split in the
resoutions committee and the threat
ening niring of differences on the con
vention floor. They held a democratic
convention wouldn't bo true to life if
something didn't result in a row or
near row nnd the HUH convention has
been entirely too tame, in their opinion
to live up to the best traditions of the
party. On Wednesday if any democrat
had dared to predict there would have
been any difference of opinion in plat
form, ho would probably have been
laughed down in derision. The platform
was the main thing on which it was
thought the party was in complete ac
cord. Its skeleton foundation hud been
prepared by President Wilson sd it
was assumed nil the resolutions commit
tee would linvo to do was to fill it
with choice words and tack on some
weatherhonrdiue to make it woathe
proof.
But the carpenters had differen
ideas as to the sort of planking to be
used and the row was on. Democrncy
will have at lenst u bit of a fight on
its hands when the convention meets at
11 o'clock.'
