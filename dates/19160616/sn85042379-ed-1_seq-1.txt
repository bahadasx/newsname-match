NUMBER 7
GRADE CROSSING
OVERTRACKS
Officials Say that if City Insists,
Crossing WiU be Put In.
WILL BE NO IMPROVEMENT
Council Meets and Decides Crossing
is Necessary. Other Business
Transacted.
Glasgow will soon have a grade
crossing through the Great Northern
yards. In a letter to the city coun
cil, Vice President J. M. Gruber of
the Great Northern stated that the
matter of putting in a crossing had
been taken up with the executives of
the road, but as the cost was too
great considering the other improve
ments the company was making here
this year, they decided not to put it
in. But Mr. Gruber stated that if
the city insisted on a grade crossing,
the Great Northern would put one
in here.
After a discussion, the Council de
cided that a grade crossing through
the yards was absolutely necessary,
and so informed the officials of the
Great Northern.
The crossing will probably be put
in this summer, while the new ware
house is being constructed and other
improvements in the yards are being
made.
Other important business came up
at the meeting of the Council. Wed

about $10,000.
HAUGE LEAVES
ON AUTO TOUR
With Complete Qutfit Journey is
Begun. Will Travel Through
Many States.
Monday morning, T. A. Hauge left
this city on an automobile tour that
will take him into almost every state
in the union and will occupy some six
months time. He will travel east
to the Atlantic coast, and then south
to New Orleans and thence to the
Pacific coast, returning to Glasgow in
the fall.
His equipment consisted of a big
Overland six and a trailer specially
constructed for this trip. On the
trailer are all the camping tools and
utensils, so that Mr. Hauge can stop
anywhere along the road and camp
or cook meals.
On the hood, painted in yellow was
a sign reading "Otto M. Christinson
Land Co. Ask me for Literature."
Mr. Hauge also had a big supply of
advertising matter on this section of
the country and Glasgow and will
spread these through the territory
which he traverses.
In the party were Mr. and Mrs.
Hauge and their two daughters and
G. A. Hauge, Mr. Hauge's father,
who will travel as far as Grand Forks,
N. D.
Everything in the outfit has been
thoroughly tried out and Mr. Hauge
before leaving demonstrated that he
could stop anywhere and have the
camping outfit up and everything
ready to retire in twelve minutes.
HUGHES HEADS THE
REPU BLICA N TICKET
Colonel Roosevelt Declines Progressive Nomination and
Paves Way,for United Party.
PROGRESSIVES TO SUPPORT HUGHES
Bull Moose Leaders Throughout the Country Urge Roosevelt to
Support G. O. P. Nominee. Leaders Predict Sweeping
Victory at Polls.
Hufehes and Fairbanks! This will
be the battle-cry of the unit«! Re
publican party at the election this
year'. And the wave of sentiment that
is sweeping over the country, augurs
well for the election of Hughes by
the biggest vote ever given a candi
date for President.
By declining the Progressive nom
ination, Colonel Roosevelt paved the
way for uniting the factions of the
Grand Old Party, and made possible
the coming into power of the party of
Lincoln and the expounding of the
principles which spell peace and pros
perity for the country.
Progressive leaders throughout the
nation have already pledged their sup
port to Hughes, and advices from the
east are that Roosevelt is to take an
active part in the campaign to elect
Charles Evans Hughes.
Republican leaders are in accord in
the belief that the national campaign
will be one of the most bitterly con
tested in the history of American
politics. They are satisfied that
Hughes will win but they do not in
tend to approach the task on the
theory that it is all over but the
shouting and will center their attack
on the administration's f o r e i
policy, and the dangers they believe
may menace the country's interest
MISS McCORMICK TO
GIVE SONG RECITAL
At Orpheum Theatre, Tuesday Eve
ning, June 27th. Fine Program.
Once more the Altar Society has
the opportunity of offering the public
a song recital by Miss Marie McCor
mick of St. Paul, accompanied by
Mrs. Maurice Reuler of Glasgow. This
entertainment will be given at the
Orpheum, June 27th, at 8:30 p. m.
These ladies have appeared before
the people of Glasgow for two suc
cessive years and each time have been
met by very appreciative audiences.
The following is a clipping from
the St. Pa al Pioneer Press with refer
ence to a song recital given by Miss
McCormick during the past winter:
"Miss McCormick has a voice as j steadily increasing, and with this
C. J. Lee Buys Half Interest in Rap
idly Growing Business.
One of the important business
changes that has taken place in the
city the past week is the incorpor
ation of the Glenn Maris Hardware
Co., and the purchase of a half inter
est in the business by Mr. C. J. Lee
of Havre.
The capitalization of the new firm
has been raised to $10,000 fully sub
scribed, and the new name of the firm
will be Maris A Lee.
While one of the newest business en
terprises in the city, the hardware
store of Glen Maris has been enjoy
ing a lucrative business that has been
fresh, as true, as spontaneous as that
of a bird on a May morning. In fact,
at her recital last evening one was
constantly reminded of young, spring
like and beautiful things. It is not
often that so admirably instructed a
voice and one that is employed with
such intelligence preserves a quality
so original. With one's eyes shut
it now and then suggests the pure,
cool tone of a boy soprano.
"Her program indued songs by
Mozart, Schubert, Brahms, Strauss,
the cycle of gypsy melodies by Dvorak
as well as several selections by Eng
lish composers, and it was throughout
sung with a musical refinement, a
delicacy and skill that was unusually
charming."
A partial list of the songs she will
sing appear below:
.... , ,
^An die Musik» . .. Schubert,
Aria from La Traviata" Verdi
"Saeterjentens Sondag" Ole Bull
"The Swallow" Dell 'Acqua
"A June Morning" Willeby
"Flower Rain" Sahneider
"The Fairy Pipers" Brewer
"Now Sleeps the Crimson Petal"....
Qulter
"Like the Rosebud" La Forge
"The Star" Rogers
"Day is Gone" Lang
"The Years at the Spring" Beach
NORVAL CASE ENDED
After a trial lasting nearly a week,
Jack Norval was fined $500 and given
a sentence of six months for shoot
ing Harley Martin last fall. The
court suspended sentence. There was
considerable local interest in the case
and many witnesses went to Glen
dive from here.
the days following the war, should
the Democratic administration be con
tinued in Washington.
If present plans are realized, the
Republican ticket will be supported
this year by the most distinguished
array of spellbinders ever assem
bled in one organization. Its per
sonnel will include two former Presi
dents, and two men who have had
service in the office of Secretary of
State.
That Mr. Taft will go on the stump
for the ticket is known for a cer
tainty. Few Republicans doubt that
Mr. Roosevelt will tour the country
for Hughes. Elihu Root and P. C.
Knox, each having served as Secre
tary of State will uphold the Repub
lican cause in many states.
Weeks, Burton, Sherman, Cummins,
Lodge, Borah and Willis, all of whom
had supported the convention are ex
pected to take part in a campaign
that the Republicans say will be wag
ed with vigor by all concerned.
The list of Republican speakers will
be well balanced for appeals to both
factions of the party. Taft, Root,
Knox, and Lodge, are likely to spend
most of their time in the conservative
East. The Progressive west will be
gniaddressed by Roosevelt if he goes in.
I Me will be assisted by Senator Cum
intens and Senator Borah.
MARIS HARDWARE
COMPANY EXPANDS
growth, Mr. Maris felt the need of
additional capital. Mr. Lee, realiz
ing the fine business opportunities in
the city and seeing the chance to get
in on the ground floor of a thriving
and prosperous business, purchased a
half interest in the store.
With the additional capital in the
business, the firm expects to carry
a bigger and more varied line of
goods, and they will be able to handle
their .trade better tha n ever. fir.
Lee has had several years experience
in the hardware business and will
make an excellent partner for Mr.
Maris in conducting the business.

Premium books are now being mail
ed out and any farmer or scholar de
siring one can secure it by calling on
the Secretary at the Commercial Club
rooms or by writing for it.
FARMERS WARNED
A letter from A. G. Scholes, State
Dairy Commissioner to S. C. Moore,
Secretary of the Glasgow Commer
cial Club bears the information that
unreliable persons are working thru
the state promoting and building
creameries. The promoters are sell
ing the creameries to farmers and
make glowing predictions of their sue
cess, also promising impossible re
turns to their victims which cannot
l.e fulfilled.
An effort is being made by the
Dairy Commissioner to forstall these
nrif.n in their operations and has ask
ed that his office be informed cf any
attempts to sell creameries in any
part of Valley County. Every one
is \va: ned to be

THE LOCAL WEATHER
The report of the local observer
shows that higher temperature dur
ing the past week has made a mark
ed improvement on vegetation. Spring
work is about finished and a number
of farmers are plowing for fall seed
ing. Range and stock are in excel
lent condition. Favorable weather
conditions now existing point toward
bumper crops for this section this
year. The total precipitation for the
week was .31 of an inch.
LAUNDRY UNDER
NEW PROPRIETOR
Hawley Sells His Interests to S.
C. Woody. Many Changes
Contemplated.
S. C. Woody is now the sole owner
of the Glasgow Steam Laundry, hav
ing purchased the interests of David
Hawley in the. firm.
Mr. Hawley expects to leave Glas
gow and will .take his family to the
mountains to stay until fall, when he
will embark on some business ven
ture.
In taking over the control of the
laundry, Mr. Woody expects to make
it the best in the state. Since the
businfess began, less than a year ago,
it has exeprienced a steady growth,
and with the changes and improve
ments contemplated by Mr. Woody,
the increase will continue.
The laundry is already equipped
with new and modern laundry ma
chinery for doing the very best work,
and Mr. Woody expects to have every
customer satisfied with the work turn
ed out. Among the new additions
to the service now rendered will be,
the repairing of torn clothes and the
sewing on of buttons. This will es
pecially appeal to the bachelor ele
ment in the community.

LOCALS DEFEAT
NASHUA TEAM
Opponents Trounced in Bat-Fest
by Score of 14 to 4.
SPAULDING FANS SIXTEEN
Heavy Clouting of Locals Feature.
Bardill Starred With Stick. Mo
vold Got a Home Run.
Fourteen runs and sixteen hits was
the gentle reminder given Nashua
Sunday that Glasgow has a "real ball
team". The Nashua boys never had .
a look-in and the demon clouters on
the local nine caused the humiliation
of two pitchers.
In the first inning Dr. Burgess was
introduced to the Glasgow boys, and
pre-game reports were that he was
"some" pitcher. But Lefty Reynolds
took little stock in this and poled out
a neat single. Movold got on safe
ly and Herstorm got hit between home
plate and the grandstand. Jobst fol
lowed with a single and there was a
brief respite when Thrasher struck
out, but Bardill picked out one for
a double, Spaulding hit a sacrifice fly,
Hocking singled and Hurly doubled,
netting five runs. Reynolds batting
for the second time in that inning got
a walk and Movold went out, Puckett
to Bricker.
After four or five Glasgow clouters
had landed on his offerings for hits,
Burgess put out the distress sign,
and Puckett came in from right field
and finished the game.
The locals added two runs in the
fth inning, three in the sixth and
four in the ninth, while Nashua had
to be content with getting one in
the third and three in the fourth.
Although pitching against a heavy
wind, John Spaulding hurled one of
the best games of the season. Only
two safe bingles did Nashua get and
sixteen batsmen were sent back to
the bench talking to themselves.
Of the swatters, Bardill got the
most hits, getting four safeties in
five times up. One was for three
bags, two doubles and one single, and
they all came when hits meant runs.
Spaulding also poled out some long
getting a a triple
three times up, and he was robbed
of a sure-enough home run in the
sixth when Bland made a circus catch
of his long fly. Movold got the long
est hit of the day for a home run.
