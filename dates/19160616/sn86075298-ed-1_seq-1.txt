BEET SUGAR
FACTORY ASSURED
The Great Western Sugar Co.,
with factories at Billings, Mon
tana, Sheridan, Wyoming, and
other cities in Utah and the west,
has decided to build a factory in
western Montana, as will appear
more definitely in the letter
printed below.
This company recently sent
two of the officials, H. I. Rolapp
of Ogden, Utah, and W. L. Law
son of Billings, over the Flathead
and other portions of western
Montana on a tour of investiga
tion and inspection. From their
report it was decided to. build the'
factory, but the exact location
has not been definitely decided.
Ronan would be pleased to be
selected for the location, and
there is every reason to believe
that this town stands an equal
chance with other locations in
being designated as the most
central and available point for
the building of the factory. If
the Northern Pacific should start
work on the extension from Dix
on, those in the secrets of the
sugar company assert that our
chances are better than any of
the other towns under consider
ation.
The letter above referred to is
as follows:
Billings, Mont., June 8, 1916.
Mr. Stanley Scearee,
Ronan, Mont.
Dear Sir:-You will undoubtedly be in
terested in knowing that as a result of
the investigation of, and report on, the
Western Montana country, made by
Judge Henry H. Rolapp and myself,
our company has decided to send one
of their most experienced agricultur
ists to work in the territory and in
every way possible prepare the com
rmunity for growing beets on a com
rnercial scale in Western Montana for
the year 1917.
No decision has been arrived at as to
the exact location of a factory. We
have, as you know, endeavored to tell
every one that the mere location of the
plant was immaterial as compared with
the importance of having a cash crop
in the community, and before deter
rmining where a location will be, we
ha:e to be still further satisfied that
the community is in earnest- in its de
sire to grow beets and will prepare this
year for growing beets for 1917 and
make their plans for fall plowing, etc.,
accordingly this fall.
Mr. R. M. Barr, who is our agricul
turist to be located in western Mon
tana, is one of the most experienced
beet sugar agriculturists in the employ
of this company and has had a very
wide experience, and he will work from
Missoula as a central point from which
to study all the different valleys. He
will be working under the direction of
this office at Billings and under my
supervision and he will be instructed to
work on the theory that a factory will
be located and operated somewhere in
western Montana in 1917, and I might
say that the decision as to whether
such a factory will be located in west
ern Montana for 1917, will depend al
t gether upon the support and definite
plans made by the community to grow
bees for such a plant.
A ,uring you that we are very fa
v\s ably impressed with the possibilities
of western Montana, and hoping the
result of our recent visit and the fur
ther investigation of Mr. Barr will
bring about the establishment of a
plant in time to operate in 1917, I am,
Very truly yours,
W. L. LAWSON.
As will be noticed from read
ing this letter, the final action
-of the sugar company rests with
the farmers on the Flathead. If
the farmers will contract to
grow the required number of
beets to insure the factory a suf
ficient tonnage to warrant the
building of the factory, then the
factory will be built. The Pio
neer trusts that our farmers will
realize the value of the factory
to them and the profit to be real
ized from the growing of beets
'1 and make the contracts. which
will insure its being built. There
is no question but what sugar
beets are the most profitable
crop our farmers could grow and
it will not only yield them more
money per acre for their land
than any other crop, but will en
hance the value of their land
faster than any other.
With water now available on
so much of the land, there should
be no hesitancy on the part of
farmers in entering into contract
to grow beets. Beets are easily
irrigated, much more so than
cereal crops, and while the labor
may be greater to produce the
crop, the returns are so much
larger that once the growing of
beets is undertaken every farmer
will continue to plant beets.
This has been true wherever
tried out, and the Flathead will
not be the exception to the ;rule.
RONAN CAN HAVE WATER
WORKS AND ELECTRIC LIGHIS
Major W. H. Smead of Missoula,
was in Ronan the latter part of last
week and while here discussed water
works and electric lights with a Pio
neer representative. The Major has
been interested in this proposition for
several years and at one time was very
anxious to secure the privilege of in
stalling systems here. The matter
dragged along and owing to circum
stances beyond the control of Mr.
Smead he was prevented from doing so.
Major Smead now says that he is
ready to finance the proposition and
has the money offered him with which
to build a water system just as soon as
the town will grant him the privilege.
That we should accept his offer is
patent to all who are compelled to
drink water from the barrels around
town, and when it is known that the
tank from which most people now get
their drinking water is polluted and
unfit for even a beast to drink,- it
should be the incentive to action which
will result in a pipe line being brought
into Ronan which would furnish water
of which no town could boast of better
or purer.
In this connection it may be well to
state that no one will be allowed to
divert the mountain streams from
which Ronan will eventually get a
water supply, unless an application is
made to the secretary of the interior
by the town council for such permis
mission. It has now been close to five
years since incorporation was secured
and the prime object of the incorpor
ation was to be in a position to ask for
a right to use the water for municipal
purposes, but no request has yet been
officially made. The town council of
Ronan should survey out the proposed
line, have blue prints made and file an
application to use the water. The red
tape methods of governmental matters
cause much delay and the longer the
request is put off the longer Ronan
will be without a water system.
If Ronan really wants a water and
lighting system some action should be
taken at once which will enable the
systems being constructed.

STONE CRITICISES ACTION
St. Louis, June 13.-The nomination
of Justice Hughes by the Republicans
at Chicago doesn't meet with the ap
proval of Senator William J. Stone,
who is to be chairman of the Demo
cratic resolutions committee. He even
"views It with alarm."
Not that Mr. Hughes will be a hard
man for President Wilson to beat.
Mr. Stone is looking to the future.
"My objection to the nomination of
Mr. Hughes," the senator in a state
ment said, "lies in the fact that I re
gard it as bad in every way, even
vicious, for a great political party,I
hard pressed and on its uppers, to in
1 vade the supreme court of the United
States and take down from that bench
one of its justices to make him a par
ty candidate for a political office to
meet and serve a party exigency.
"The experiment is full of menace
and danger. Hereafter it is more than
probable that men appointed to the
supreme court will begin to regard it
not as the honorable and final goal of
their ambition, but as a stepping
stone to political advancement."
HUGHES AND FAIRBANKS
REPUBLICAN NOMINEES
Charles Evans Hughes of New
York, rxeived the republican
nomination for president at Chi
n cago last Friday on the third
ballot, receiving 949 votes, the
balance scattering, with Roose
velt receiving 18 votes. An ad
journment was taken until
Thursday evening after the sec
ond ballot, which showed no ma
terial change, but when the con
vention assembled Friday at 11
a. m., the result was a foregone
conclusion and Hughes was con
ceeded the winner.
p Charles W. Fairbanks of In
diana, was the almost unanimous
choice for vice president on the
first ballot, Burkett of Nebraska,
being the only other candidate.
- The nomination was made unan
imous.
The nominee for president has
been governor of New York and
DEMOCRATS ARE
RATHER PUZZLED
Two things already have been prac
tically decided upon. One is that the
Democratic campaigners will make a
drive against Mr. Hughes because he
left the United States supreme court
to enter the political arena.
The other step decided upon is that
the Democratic party will make a spe
cial effort to get the support of dis
contented Bull Moosers for President
Wilson.
As an invitation to the former
Roosevelt followers to enter the Dem
ocratic fold there was talk on the part
of some of the leaders of the possi
bility of inviting a few of the Pro
gressive leaders to St. Louis for the
purpose of talking to them and as
certaining if there was any common
ground on which they could stand
with the Democratic party.
Inasmuch as the Roosevelt follow
ers had made their chief issue in the
last few months against the alleged
inadequacy of the present administra
tion's national defense program and
the shortcomings of its foreign policy,
many here were unable to see how the
radicals in the Bull Moose party and
the Democrats could hitch uo toaether.
St. Louis, June 13.-The Democrats
assembling here for their national
convention are worried.
The thing is too one sided, too much
of a one man show. They are afraid it
won't be worth the price of admission
and, incidentally, it won't look as good
in the newspapers as did the recent
double header performance In Chicago.
The Democrats are hoping somebody
will start something, make a little
trouble that won't be serious, that will
give the seasoning to this dish that is
being prepared by the party cooks.
It looks now as if the leaders will
be disappointed, as if this national
gathering of the party is to pass of'
without even the suggestion of a fiblit
-something unheard of for a I)neou
criatic convention.
The loaders haven't given up Ioe
but the prospect of any intere;ti
rumpus has almost reached the vat
ishing point.
While the convention itself is li i ly
to be dull and commonplace important
plans in regard to Democratic strategy
in the coming campaign already are
being worked out.
HUGHES RE-ENTERS POLITICS
New York, June 13.-Charles E.
Hughes re-entered politics, apparently
with abundant zest. He reached this
city early in the day, established tem
porary headquarters at an uptown ho
tel and virtually held open house.
Scores of persons on various mis
lions flocked to his rooms, mostly men
Who had known him when he was cam
paigning for governor of New York.
There also were several party lead
ers among his callers. Mr. Hughes is
sued no statement and expects to is
sue none until he is formally notified
of his nomination.
The past week has been much warmer
and while this is welcomed by farmers,
a good shower would add to their en
couragement. It is reported dry in
many sections.
v at the time of receiving this high
z honor was one of the justices of
- the supreme court. He accepted
I the nomination and immediately
e sent his resignation to President
- Wilson as a member of the su
- preme court.
1 Fairbanks has been vice pres
- ident once before and was a can
- didate for president at this time,
- but did not develop sufficient
I strength to land the coveted
a prize. In a telegram to the
- chairman of the convention that
he accepted, saying he believed
- it his duty to respond to the call
of his party.
The Progressives nominated
Theodore Roosevelt and Col.
Parker of Louisana. but Roose
velt declined the honor. This
action will probably mean the
amalgamation of the republicans
and progressives and many be
I lieve in the election of Hughes.
ONE BAD INNING
LOSESBALL GAME
It was a good game; but one bad in
ning lost the game for Ronan. The
Dixon sluggers bunched their hits and
pounded out four scores and were never
headed, winning the game 4 to,3. That
could be said to be the whole story of
last Sunday's game, but there is more
to it which can be printed. The locals
went into the game cock sure of victory
and perhaps that accounts in a measure
for their defeat.
The game in detail shows that it was
a fast one all the way through, with
excitement enough to make up for any
other defects.
Dixon was first to bat and Buell the
first man up fanned; James out Wag
ner to Darnell; Boggess fanned.
For Ronan Darnell was given a base
on balls; White made a hit advancing

out Wagner to Darnell. Four scores.
McLaughlin first man up hit the ball
on the nose and it went over the left
field fence and John Swee was out a
new Stetson hat, as he gives one for
each home run by any Ronan player;
Jacobs hit to McTuckee and was thrown
out at first; I-lull out Buell to Boggess;
Darnell fanned. One score.
Third inning--Roeves struck out;
Mclnstadt ditto; Lozeau made a safe

something fierce.

NORTHERN PACIFIC SUR
VEYORS AGAIN IN RONAN
1 Engineer Mowrey and eight men,
t constituting the Northern Pacific sur
3 veying corps, which has been operating
r between Ronan and Dixon for the past
five weeks, are again in Ronan. The
Pioneer is informed that work will be
extended north from Ronan at present,
straightening out the line and estimat
ing the construction expense as the
work progresses.
It is stated on reliable authority that
I it is now contemplated establishing the
permanent survey about 400 feet closer
to Ronan, all of which is very grati
fying. It was given out officially that
- the road when built would run about
one-half mile west of town, but a
r change in the survey south of town
r permits the line to be brought much
* nearer and it is now thought the line
i line will be several hundred feet nearer
than anticipated a couple of weeks ago.
In running the line from Mission
creek it has been determined that by
lengthening the line about one-half
mile a great saving can be made in the
grading and this fact also allowed the
line to diverge to the east all along the
I route north from Mission creek. The
same grade is maintained and it is now
merely a question of maintenance of
the increased length of the line.
It would really seem that with all the
work being done here this year that
the N. P. means business and there
are a great many who are confident
the Dixon extension will be in Ronan
in time to haul out the 1916 crop.
ALONG ENTIRE
EASTERN LINE
London, June 13.-Heavy fighting is
in progress over virtually the entire
eastern front from the Gulf of Riga
to Bukowina, a distance of between
600 and 700 miles.
From Riga to the Pasiolda river,
Germans have taken the offensive
against Russians, probably in an ef
fort to divert the attention of the
Russians who are in the second week
of their drive against the Austro-Hun
garians and Germans from the Pripet
marshes southward to Bukowina.
On all sectors of the northern line
the Russians have successfully with
stood German onslaughts. They have
even gained ground against attacking
forces north of the Tirul marsh,
southwest of Riga, Petrograd says.
In Southwest Russia, in the region
of Lutsk, fresh advances against Aus
tro-1Hungarians are reported by the
Russian war office, as is the case
across the border through East Ga
licia.
Although the Austrians at numerous
points are vigorously counter attack
ing the only place the Russians have
been forced to give ground before
them was near Bobulintze, north of
Buczacz, in Balicia, where the Aus
trians were reinforced by German
troops.
The Russians captured here by the
Teutonic allies exceeded 1,300. The to
tal of men taken prisoners by the Rus
sians since their offensive began has
grown to more than 114,000.
Northeast of Verdun, Germans have
thrown successive attacks against
French positions north of Thiaumont,
but were repulsed with serious losses.
Heavy bombardment by Germans in
this region extended from Thiaumont
eastward, to the west and south of
Fort Vaux and to the French second
line positions of Fort Souville and
Fort Tavannes, about three miles
northeast of Verdun.
1
RUSSIANS NEAR CZERNOWITZ
Petrograd, June 13.-A rumor is
circulating here that Russians have oc.
copied Czernowitz, capital of the Aus
trian crowniand of Bukowina. The
rumor lacks ofticlal confirmation, but
it has been given color by the cap
ture of Dobronovtze, a commanding
point ten miles to the northeast.
The Russian line here extends to
Okna. From both points good roads
lead direct to Czernowitz and, accord
Ing to military authorities, they are
the only points in this direction capi
ble of defense.
BUYS SOUTH DAKOTA ROAD
'st. Paul, June 11.-C. O. Kalman of
Kla I on, Matteson & Wood bought
the South Dakota Central railroad for
$9.,2,000 and other considerations. Mr.
Kalman will reorganlie the company
and operate the road. The South Da.
kota Central railroad runs from Sioux
Falls to Watertown, 103 miles. It
has always earned interest on its
bonded indebtedness. The road is
standard gauge and was built by Iowa
and South Dakota capitalists. It has
a capital stock of $2,204i,000 and a
bonded debt of $820,000. Mr. Kalman
bought the road at Sioux Falls at a
sale held by Henry S. Stebbins, re
ceiver. The foreclosure was made by
the bondholders. The road has been
in the hands of the receivers since
Mnarch, 191:. The road became in
volved in financial difficulties when it
contracted to build north of Water
tOWn.
BANK RESOURCES GAINING
tvua:nington, .June 13..-Hesources of
national banks in the United States
continue to increase rapidly. Their
growth in the period between March 7
and May 1, Comptroller Williams an
nounced, was $2,56,0&0,000, pushing
the total up to more than $14,000,000,
000.
Deposit.. in the same time increased
$341,000,000, reaching a total of more
than $11,000,000,000. Circulation de
creased $13,000,000.
PEACEMAKER IS SHOT DOWN
Billings, Mont., June 13.-Frank
Culley, a railroad employe, interfered
in a quarrel between F. W. Hulbert
and the latter's wife and was shot
and probably fatally wounded. Hul
bert has been arrested.
JEWS PLANNING A COLONY
Waco, Tex., June 13.-At the Jew
ish Farm City trustees of the grand
lodge, District 7, Independent Order
of Boat B'rith. organized a campaign
to raise $1,000,000 for the project. The
plan is to establish a great Jewish
farming colony.
