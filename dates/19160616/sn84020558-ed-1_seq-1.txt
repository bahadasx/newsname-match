COLISEUM, June 15. Presi
dent Wilson and Vice President
Marshall were nominated by fi
clamation tonight by the demo
cratic national convention; the
ticket being completed four min
utes before Friday.
Contrary to expectations, how
ever, the convention did not fin
ish its work because the plat
form was not ready and it will
meet again at 11 o'clock Friday
morning.
It was announced in the conven
tion that the sub-committee draft
ing the platform had finished its
work but that the entire resolu
tions committee was not as
sembled to pass upon it and it
was not known when that could
be done. , President Wilson's own
plank charging conspiracy among
some foreign-born citizens for the
benefit of foreign powers and de
nouncing any political party which
benefits and not repudiating such.
A section was incorporated in
the platform just as the presi
dent himself has sent it from
Washington. It was understood
that the president insisted that
the plank should be put in the
nlatform he way he had written
it.
There never was any doubt of
President "Wilson's nomination to
night lint there was a possibility that
rnmc vice presidential booms might
lie brought out in opposition to Mar
shall. They melted away, however,
when the convention got in session
and as soon as President -Wilson's
nomination had been made.
To President Wilson's nomination
there was only one dissenting vote,
P.obert Emmelt Burke of Illinois, who
came to the convention announcing
he was opposed to the president.
When Judge Wescott of New Jersey
had placed the president in re-nomination
and the nomination had been
seconded by former Governor Harmon
of Ohio and Ciovernor Stuart of Vir
ginia, the delegates wanted to wait
no longer and cried "vote, vote."
On motion of Senator Hughes of
New Jersey, the rules were suspended
and no ballots whatever were taken.

1.AP.EOO. Texas, Juno 15. Three
American soldiers are dead and six are
wranded a a result of the latest raid
on American territory by Mexicans
coming from the southern side of the
Ric Or.mde early today. No civilians
were injured, as the raid was primarily
an attack on the border patrol at tha
little settlement of San Ignacio, forty
miles southeast of Laredo.
Although successful in a measure,
the raid was not wholly surprising to
tbe American guard, which, in larger
numUrs than the Mexicans expected to
find, saw in the bright moonlight the

bandits to the rear of where Troop M

camped, and where Troop I was but
a slnrt ' distance away. Both wero
under command of Major Alonzs Gray.
The Mexican toll was last reported
as eiht known dead, a number of
wounded, and several captured. In
addition, forty-two horses, once Mex
ican mounts, were captured One Mex
ican who surrendered said, according
to those who mr.de him captive, that
he was forced into the raid, and that
his sentiments were not anti-American.
The Mexicans attacked Troop M, en

shot at the sentry. At the sound o'

shows nowhere any signs of sclack
enir.g. All along the front fresh gains
for the Russian troops and the cap
ture of thousands of additional pris
oners and of guns, machine guns and
war supplies are claimed by the Rus
sians. The number of prisoners now
exceeds 150,000.
While semi-official advices from
Petrograd give a report that the Aus
trians have evacuated Czernowitz,
capital of Eukowina, the latest offi
cial communication from Austrian
headquarters says the troops of Em
peror Francis Joseph are making a
stand north and east of the city and
both have repressed Russian attacks.
In the drive westward from the re
gion of Lutsk the Austrians are coun
ter attacking or entrenching them
selves in new positions for a stand
against the Russians.
No report of gains of either side in
Galicia in the region of Tarnoiol
have come through. Here apparently
there is still a deadlock, between the
Russians and the Austrians and Ger
mans. On the German end of the northern
front in Russia the Russians near Ba
ranovichi attacked and carried Ger
man trenches, but later were forced,
to give them up under strong pres
sure by the Germans. Infantry at
tacks by the Germans have occurred
along the Dvina river and in the lake
region south of Dvinsk, but all of
these were repulsed, according to
Petrograd.
The French on the slopes south of
Lemorthomme, northwest of ViTdim
have attacked and captured a Ger
man trench. The Germans are still
violently bombarding the sectors of
Thiaamont and Tort Souville, north
east of A'erdun, probably preparatory
to another infantry attack with the

SAN ANTONIO, June 15. Lui de
la Rosa today made good his threat to
raid the border when one hundred of
his men attacked a small detachment
of the Fourteenth American cavalry,
numbering about eighty men, at San
Ignacio, forty miles southeast of La
redo. His action cost him eight men
killed, several wounded and many
horses and some equipment. Tho
American loss was three killed and six
wounded.
Major Alonzo Gray late today was
using every man of his little command
in a sweeping search of the country
about San Ignacio for a "hot trail." If
it is discovered, a third "punitive ex
pedition" will enter Mexico, but at de
partment headquarters General Fun
ston and his staff have little hope that
Major Gray will be able to get into
touch with the band. By daylight this
morning the attacking force had scat
tered like quail. The larger part re
entered Mexico but some ofj them at
least scattered along the brush-covered
country on the American side.
The Americans fought from trenches
into which they were ordered imme
diately after the attack began. When
they moved out and began the offen
sive the Mexicans were gone.
The American dead are:
Private Minaden, Troop M.
Private Charles F. Flowers, Troop M
Private Edward Kataneh, Troop M.
The American wounded are:
Privates Thomas H. Ewing and
James E. Rouch, Troop I; Corporal
William Oberlies, l'rivates William
Minnette, Tony Havlina and Henry
Mtatasoff of Troop M.
Major Gray reported that he had
been in communication with a detach- 1
ment of Carranza troops on the Mexi
can side of the river and that its of
ficer commanding had informed him
that his men already had run down
and shot four oi the bandits. Major
Gray made no comment on the officer's
statement.
The identity of the raiding party was
established by the story of Vicente
Dira, who entered the American camp
several hours after the fight and an
nounced that he had been a prisoner
of the Mexicans.
The name of the raiders' leader has
not been reported. From the body of
one of the Mexicans papers were taken
that indicated that he was Cruz Ruis,
a major in the Carranza army. Undue
importance was not attached to this
discovery by army officers, however,
who believe it not improbable that Ruis
was carrying the papers more as sou
venirs of the days when he was an of
ficer in the government army than to
show his authority now.
General Funston has not ordered
more troops to reinforce Major Gray's
command, but if he succeeds in finding
a trail justifying him in crossing the
international line in pursuit of the
band, a supporting party will be sent
forward immediately.
Eighteen Hundred Troops
Now Pursuing The Yaquis
DOUGLAS, June 13. Disposition of
tlie new lines of the de facto Mexican I
army in Southern and Central Sonora
was completed yesterday, and the
Yaqui Indian drive was started today
by' eighteen hundred cavalrymen in
ijive columns, according to a telegram
from General P. Elias Calles to General
Arnulfo Gomez at Agua Prieta today.
General Callestated that within
thirty days every hostile band of In
dians would be driven from the state,
either into Arizona on the north, or
Chihuahua on the east of Sonora.
The towns in the Ures and Alamos
districts have been connected by tele
phone to aid in the pursuit of the In
dians. Two lines of infantry have been
stationed across the country while the
cavalry will sweep the country in be
tween. Calles denied that his troops
have had any fights with the Indians
during the last two weeks. .
Arrivals today from Mexico con
firmed reports received here yesterday
that bands of Yaquis are operating
west of the town of Moctezuma under
the leadership o$ Huero (Whitey), a
Mexican renegade. Fully twenty
Mexicans, including women and chil
dren, are reported to have been tor
tured to death by Huero's immediate
band.
A detachment of Mexican troops and
Yaquis are reported to have fought
indecisively for several hours near
Huepac, last week. The casualties are
unknown.
