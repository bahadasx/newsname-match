At One of Which Eciy Mule Citizen

'ttVashlngton, June 14. Details of
a new universal military training anil
service bill to be presented to Con
gross soon became known to-ilay. It
provides that nil male citizens Bliall
enlist for six months' military camp
tr.Miug during the calendar year In
winch they becomo IS years of ago
and thereafter tihnll be illschnrged
Into the reserve. In tlmo of war
tilt-so trained men might bo called
iuto active service by classes of years,
the youngest first.
The bill was drawn by Capt. Geo
Vnn Horn Moselcy, of tho General
StalT of the Army, acting unofficlal
ly In behalf of national defense or
ganizations. It wilt bo proposed as
a substitute for the pending Cham
berlain universal training blll.whlch
provides for short periods of varied
training extending over ten years,
between the ages of 13 and 23. A
vigorous campaign will be made for
passago of the measure at this ses
sion of Congress, it Is said.
The only exemptions from train
ing under tho proposed legislation
-would bo young men physically or
otherwise unfit, and members of per
manent military ..or naval forces. To
encourage military training in
schools, ono month's credit -on tho
six months' compulsory service
would be allowed for each year of
military work In recognized Institu
tions, with a limit of four months'
credit.
Would KITect Economy.
The l'rsldent would bo empowered
to suspend tho organization of any
number of regular army units, and
to assign their officers to the train
ing camps. This would effect econ
omy, It Is urged, by permitting a re
duction of tho regular army without
reducing the force available In case
of war.
A system of penalties would bo
provided for employers of men abovo
the age of 18 years who had not
passed through the training. Per
sons not complying also would bo
barred from holding any position un
der tho Federal Government, and in
cn-je they leave the country to cscapo
servlco would bo required to fulfill
the obligation on their return.
Unruly characters might bo segre
gated and trained In special discip
linary organizations. Friends of tho
bill point out this might go far to
ward solving present problems of
treating Incorrlglblo youths. No pay
would bo allowed for tho training
porlods, but tho Government would
pay nil expenses. If called Into ac
tive service later, tho men would re
celvo regular array pay.
Many Training Cnnip.x.
Tho proposed menauro contem
plates establishment of n large num
ber of training camps. They prob
ably would bo operated for actlvo
training only between spring and
fall, or In other seasons of moderate
temperature and good weather. Bx
penso of tho system would bo com
paratively low, friends of tho plan :
declare. They express belief that tho
burden on citizens' tlmo would bo!
lighter than under any other uulver-'
sal training method and that In ad-i
dltlon to furnishing a groat number
of available trained men, It would
provide valuablo physical and discip
linary culture

Reports of Lawlessness and Carran-

Washington, Juno 13. White
some State Department advices to
day gave a more favorable aspect to
conditions In Northern Mexico, others
reported further anti-American dem
onstrations, leaving the situation un
changed. Tho agitation has subside
ed in the Chihuahua region, where
the most violent outbreaks occurred.
Secretary Lansing refused to make
public details of consular reports.
He Indicated, however, that smashing
of store windows, parading and
speechmaklng had constituted the
greater part of the outbreaks sweep
ing tho Mexican States near the bord
er. The rioters have not distinguish"
ed between Americans and other fore-'
lgners, it was stated, although the
basls of the disorder is always the
presence of American troops ott
Mexican soil.
If the State Department has been
able to determine just what agencies
are inspiring those outbreaks the in
formation is being carefully guarded.
It Is known that some pfflcials feet
certain definite propaganda is being"
carried on without Gen. Carranza-'s
approval.
Carranza Regime Menaced, .
There are indications that officials'
here feel that the de facto Govern-
iment is itself threatened by the
spread of anti-foreign sentiment.
Just what element hostile to Car
ranza may be astir and ho'w far the
rebel movement in the Tehuantepec
region, the restlessness around Vera.
Cruz, the disloyalty of some Sftate
Governors and the antl-Araerlcarf
agitation may be interwoven fn an
organized attempt to overthrow tho
de facto Government, no official
would say. --!-:
The War Department had nothing:
but routine messages from the bord--er.
The disposition of the 1,500 reg
ulars ordered south yesterday will be
determined by Gen. Funston after
conference with Gen. Leonard Wood,
commander of the Eastern Depart
ment, by telegraph. The men now
all are under Gen. Wood's command
and will bo sent by him to points
designated by tho border commander.
Mobilized From East.
Ten companies of coast artillery,
drawn from fortifications between
Portland, Me., and Sandy Hook, and
a battalion of engineers from the bar
racks in Washington were under ord
ers to Join Gen. Pershing's army and
assist in guarding against further
border raids in the region near Lar
edo. Asslsstant Secretary of War In
gram, in tho absence of Secretary
Baker, faced a situation which offi
cials admitted appeared serious. They
feared not only continuance of band-
It raids, but tho effect which tho kill
ing of three of the bandits who raid
ed tho Coleman ranch near Laredo
Sunday might have on tho Mexican
people. Equally puzzling to officials
was tho question of what purpose is
tho basis for tho anti-American dem
onstrations and tho renewed border
attacks.
