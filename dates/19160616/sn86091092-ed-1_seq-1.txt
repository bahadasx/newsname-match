CALDWELL, IDAHO, FRIDAY, JUNE 16, 1916.
WEEKLY, $2.00 PER YEAR.
POLITICS USURP MIND
AND ATTENTION OF
FINANCIAL CENTER
The attention of Wall Street was
divided this week between the rapid
developments in the motor industry
and the great political conclave at
Chicago.
In recent weeks there lias bee,n a
decided change in the sentiment of
some of the leaders of the financial
district with respect to politics, politi
cal leaders and party candidates; and
apathy gave place to keen interest as
the time for the actual selection of the
leaders in the 1916 political race ap
proached. There is no concealing the
fact that much dissatisfaction has been
expressed by business and financial in
terests over what they choose to con
sider the weak and vacillating do
mestic and foreign policy of the pres
ent Administration; and that a new
leader of whatever political stripe, so
long as he gave assurance of ordinary
business sanity, would be acceptable
and receive hearty support. A few
months ago a "straw" poll of the New
York Stock Exchange showed an
overwhelming sentiment against the
nomination of Colonel Roosevelt; but
in recent weeks this sentiment has un
dergone a radical change, and Wall
Street was surprised to read an official
statement from the head of the big
gest bank in America advocating the
nomination of the gallant war horse
from Oyster Bay.
Wall Street's position in the matter
of Presidential candidates and the
factors that determine their accept
ance or rejection are largely deter
mined by the process of elimination
and appear quite largely in the nega
tive, and not in the positive column.
There is never the slightest hint or
suggestion of a "favorite so-n." It is
not a question as to what candidate
is the most preferred, but rather as to
which may with safety be the least
feared. Expressed in other terms, it
is the old story of a choice between
two evils, since antagonism to Wall
Street and "big interests," whether
genuine or counterfeit, is always to
be considered prime political capital.
While political conventions are sup
posed to determine and give publicity
to the issues that shall govern the
campaign, the personal tendencies
and policies of the candidates really
count for more than the platforms
adopted at these quadrennial pow
wows. Men in the heat of the political
fight are quite apt to disregard the
formal instructions of their cohorts,
and to rely upon their own personal
interpretation of the issues at stake,
in many instances sacrificing a point
here and there in the wild scramble
for votes.
Motor Stocks as Speculations.
What the war stocks provided by
way of speculative craze during the
greater part of last year is now being
furnished by the motor stocks. Ru
more and reports and exaggerations
concerning profits and mergers and
consolidations have been coming so
thick and fast that a wild speculation
in the motor issues has almost com
pletely absorbed the attention of thi
market; and the rapid rate at which
quotations have been mounting sky
ward suggests to some people a repe
tition of the fiasco that attended some
of the "war babies" in their introduc
tion to the market. Automobile mer
gers and combinations involving colos
sal figures, and enlisting the activities
of the wizards of finance, are project
ed and dissolved with lightning rapid!
ty. Some of the proposed consolida
tions include companies on the share
or properties of which no appraisal
has ever been made, and speculator s
have therefore been absorbing stocks
of which they have no reliable guagc
of intrinsic value. It is quite apparent
that some of these stocks arc being
pushed to the limit by various operat
ing pools, the object ueing to distribua
them as widely as oossible.
The 'bankers have very wisely
plied the brakes wherever possible by
severely marking down the loan val
ues on issues that have so_ recently
acquired their high position in the in
vestment list. The condition is mucl
the same as that in the loan market
on war stocks at the height of t
speculation in these shares last fall
By the same token, a note of warn
ing has been sounded by many of the
themselves, and an
ing has been sounded by many of the
brokerage houses themselves, and an
added emphasis given by the exaction
of unusually large margins for pur
chase. Investment houses which wen
interested in sonic of the new com
panies have been steadily advising
customers to use caution and to ta
profits where they amount to several
points. One big commission house
which has specialized in the mot
stocks has insisted upon buyers
some of the issues taking them up
paying in full for purchases They
think that the recent rise has been far
too rapid.
Copper and Zinc.
An echo of the increased produc
tion of copper and zinc, and more par
ticularly of the extraordinary advance
in the market prices for these metals
is to be seen in the enormous net
earnings of our leading metal c ° ,n ^
pa ni es Six of. the country's leading
copper companies and one zi
pany have just announced quarterly
dividends far in excess of any pre
vious record, and in every case he
reserve cash and product »taml at top
notch. Three months ago the same
companies ordered <ll ® bu "^! | nC i"' s
which amounted to 28 per
than this quarter's payments.
The average price of copper during
IC C 101* ahoilt
the first six months of .
26.9c per pound is the highestpr ce
since 1873. Needless to add.
profits of the world's biggest copper
companies in 1873, what with mod
erate production and high costs of
those days, did not even nearly ap
proach the tremendous profits of the
copper companies of today. For in
stance, Utah Copper and Kennecott
Copper Companies are paying divi
dends at a rate of over $16,000,000
per annum, each. Calumet & Hecla,
in its prime in 1873, paid $2,000,000
in dividends that year. This sum is
exceeded by all six copper companies
of the leaders. The average price of
zinc in the first six months of 1916 ap
proximately 1654c per pound, breaks
all records in the history of the world,
nd is more than double the maximum
price of zinc for any six months to
1915. All the companies have been,
and are, earning profits greatly in ex
cess of the munificent dividends paid.
Money and Business.
The hardening of the money mar
ket, predictions of which have been
repeatedly made in this review, is
now an actual condition, and on Tues
day of this week call money was
loaned in New York at the highest
rice since the latter part of 1914.
The long period of "easy money" that
has been such a remarkable feature of
the war period appears to be nearing
end, and the banking institutions
ill in future have less cause for
complaint over the abundance of idle
nds which do not even pay for
storage. Less than three weeks ago
short term funds were offered at 2
per cent, and there have been infre
quent periods since January first
hen the rate rose above 3 per cent.
At 4 per cent, the rate at which
loans were made this week, the high
water mark has been reached and the
suggestion made that the supplies of
loanable funds are running low. Con
sidering this fact in its relation to the
enormously increasing resources of
the banking institutions (13,838 mill
ions in the National banks alone),
gives emphasis to the new .note ot
national prosperity which has been
sounded throughout the land. Per
haps the most gratifying feature of
the financial situation has been the
return home" of the many choice
American securities formerly held by
European investors, and, in conse
quence, the future payment of inter
est and dividend disbursements to
home investors instead of to inves
tors on the other side of the Atlantic
Present indications are that the
funds of American bankinp institu
tions will be in much heavier demand
than they have been since the begin
ning of the war; for in addition to
the regular requirements of the home
gricultural, trade and industrial ac
tivities, there is in sight a foreign
demand of much importance. Nego
tiations, it is understood, are nearing
completion for a large French loan or
credit' a Russian credit also is under
egotiation; China is in the market
for a substantial amount, and Eng
land through its banks fully expects
to become a heavy borrower in New
York. . ...
Reports from various lines of bust
ness continue in a very optimistic
tone, and there seems to be a note o
general satisfaction from business
Readers in all sections. Labor is prof
itably em-loyed and enjoying many
luxuries in addition to a heaping din
ner pail. Particularly good reports
are now received from the West and
Middle West, which territory is said
to be hopeful, cheerful and prosper
ous. It is doing a large business, al
though the sensational advance lr
steel prices has led to a slight falling
off in the demand for some products
This, however, is something of a re
ief, since most of the mills are
booked so far ahead that it would be
difficult for them to take additional
orders, except in cases where de
ferred deliveries could be arranged
Some of the important jobbing houses
are doing the largest business that
they have done at any time since the
war began. ^ g CO USlNS

HAÏS OUTLINES PLAN FOR COMMERCIAL CLUB DIS
BETIEK THE BUI
ESTATE We
Mayor Hays and other prominent
business men of Boise will be in Cald
well at noon today. During this trip
through the Boise valley Mr. Hays
will present his plan for the better
ment of the real estate market; the en
couragement of investment; and the
relief of the general situation.
Mr. Hays has kindly furnished The
Tribune with an outline of his plan
which appears entirely feasible when
in the hands of a^nan of the character
of Mr. Hays. We advise our readers,
a^nan
of Mr. Hays. We advise our readers,
however, to hear Mr. Hays and as
sociates explain their plan more in de
tail.
The following statement has been
furnished by Mr. Hays:
"The real estate market on what
may be called the loop towns and vi
nity is comparatively dead; more so
than in other parts of the state. I
have called the real estate men of
Boise together for the purpose of ar
ranging a definite plan for the better
ment of conditions.
Plan of Operation.
"The plan is this: 1 propose to get
the real estate men on the loop towns
together and form what might be call
ed a syndicate. I will ask all of the
real estate men to list the farms they
have for sale with this syndicate. The
syndicate will place this list with a
selling organization in the Mississippi
Valley for Idaho farms.
"I have had much to do with the
colonization of the Twin Falls country
and I now propose to adopt the meth
ods there used so far as possible to
local conditions. Let the local real
estate men proceed to sell the farms
in this locality just as usual. The only
difference will be that all of these
farms will be listed with a strong or
ganization back east who will do their
own advertising and selling. When
the property is sold back east, the lo
cal men will get a small part of the
commission. When the local man sells
it, the commission will go to him.
Heretofore, I have found it difficult
to interest people in this locality be
cause I could not offer them a large
enough field for their operations. In
the Twin Falls district, they could get
hold of terge areas to sell and this
justified them in making the necessary
expenditures for perfecting the neces
sary organization. By this means. I
propose to put the eastern people in
touch with a large enough volume of
business to justify their giving atten
tion to it. All I ask the real estate
men to do is to get together and adopt
this plan. I will get in touch with the
eastern organization to do that end
of the business. By this method also
I propose in a way to supervise the
properties offered for sale so that the
eastern people will get something like
fair value for their money. Boise
alone would not be a large enough
field to interest an eastern organiza
tion; in fact, the operations may need
to be extended to Emmett, Caldwell
and Weiser. I rather think they will
in order to provide a field that is large
enough to justify a considerable ad
vertising campaign on the part of the
eastern people. A somewhat similar
plan is in operation on the Twin Falls
North Side tract at the present time.
Within a short time, I will be after
the Caldwell real estate men in con
nection with this plan.
"You will notice that this plan docs
not call for large contributions on the
part) of the people here in the West. I
think the method proposed is an effi
cient business plan for carrying out
the idea."

Wool Sales.
The wool sales scheduled for this
week attracted many buyers. There
was considerable wool but not very
much changed hands. Prices ranged
from 20 to 24 cents, which is about
three cents higher than last year.
CUSSES SUBJECTS OF
GREAT INTEREST
Warm weather notwithstanding the
regular monthly meeting of the Com
mercial club held Tuesday evening was
one of the most largely attended and
important of the year. Important
among the matters definitely decided
upon include the organization of a
good roads district; the establishment
of a ladies' rest room; friendly visits
to neighboring farming communities
and action on the advisability of hold
ing a Chautauqua next year.
A communication from Jessie M.
Hoover, farm home demonstrator of
the U. S. department of Agriculture,
setting fortli the need and advantages
of a ladies' rest room was read. Pres
ident Zch stated that the matter had
been taken up with Mayor Boyes and
that the mayor was inclined to favo*
renovating the room now ocupied by
the city council and equipping it to
meet the needs. It will be necessary
however for some civic organization
to provide the furnishings. The plan
of utilizing the council chamber was
endorsed by the club and a committee
consisting of E. A. Gipson, W. M.
Ewing and W. L. Hasbrouck was ap
pointed to confer with Mayor Boyes
and the Forward club for the purpose
of adopting a definite plan.
Dr. F. M. Cole, chairman of "Fac
tory Day" committee submitted
port for his committee and recom
mended that the event be made per
manent. Dr. Cole outlined the ad
vantages accruing to the owners of the
plants visited and to the businessmen
making the visit. He declared that
the number of institutions employing
from two to thirty men located in
Caldwell had proven a surprise to the
people who made the trip this year
and had given them a clearer idea of
the value of the small establishmnts
to the city.
A. A. Binford. chairman of the Chati
tauqua committee, outlined plans for
the assembly this year, declaring that
the program was the best that had yet
been offered.
Mr. Binford suggested that the club
discuss the advisability of renewing
the contract with the promoters of the
annual Chautauqua. The matter was
discussed by various club members,
the general opinion being that the
board of directors be delegated full
authority to accept or reject any offer
made bv the Ellison-White company.
It was emphasized during the discus
sion that while Caldwell citizens had
for the last three years assumed the
burden of guaranteeing the sale of 600
season tickets, thev had been actuated
solely by the belief that the event was
benefiical to the city and tributary
territory, and have received no finan
ial remuneration.
The matter of establishing a closer
social relationship with the residents
of Caldwell's trade territory was
broached by President Zeh, who sug
gested that automobile excursions be
organized to visit the different dis
tricts The plan was enthusiastically
endorsed by different speakers and a
motion that a committee of three be
appointed to arrange details and an
itinerary was adopted unanimously.
President Zch appointed Dr. F M.
Cole, J. M. Lewis and Secretary Gib
bons. It is probable that one district
will be visited each week and will in
elude Franklin, Marble Front, River
Sunny Slope, Greenleaf, Wilder,
Slop<
Gem and Notus communi

ties.
Probablv the most important mat
ter decided upon by the club member
ship was the adoption of a plan for the
! formation of a good roads district
embracing the territory tributary to
Caldwell. That the roads leading into
this city are in a deplorable condition
was the verdict of the different speak
ers all of whom urged that the only
solution of the problem lies in organi
zation. It was declared that the Cald
well territory is practically surround
ed by road districts where the high
ways are always well kept, while the

The movement to organize a district
was heartily endorsed and a commit
tee, Messrs. J. H. Forbes, J. B. Gow
en and J. J. Plowhead was appointed
with full authority to act for the club
in the formation of the district.
Amos J. Miller, manager of the Ida
ho State Fair association, addressed
the club explaining the progress of
the work. "From the encouragement
that 1 received from exhibitors and
business men since assuming the du

mensurate awards for all of Idahos
many products. Our amusement pro

ever before offered. Each day we plan
to have a special feature in addition
to an excellent racing card, Mr. Mil
ler concluded.
A determined effort will be made by
the traffic committee to secure the

the club rooms where short addresses
will be made by the Capital City con- !
tingent. The Municipal band will ren

vious to the meeting in the club rooms
and citizens are urged to attend. The

CLERK DUNLAP SUBMITS
FINE REPORT TO COUNCIL
Recommendations are Adopted And
Will be Put Into Effect at Once.
Aa a recent meeting of the city
council, Mr. S. Ben Dunlap, city clerk,
submitted his annual report. The re
port is published elsewhere in this is
sue of The Tribune, and should be
carefully read and considered by the
taxpayers of Caldwell. It covers the
ground thoroughly, gives the exact
status of affairs of the city financially,
and contains a number of interesting
and important recommendations.
The recommendations made by
Judge Dunlap have been adopted by
the city and will be put into effect.
These recommendations make for
economy, system and efficiency in the
administration of municipal affairs.
They show cen.clusively that the city
clerk is alive to the interest of the
city; familiar with municipal adminis
tration; conversant with the duties of
his office; and above all possessed of
sound judgment.
The adoption of the suggestions
made by Mr. Dunlap will be followed
by economy and efficiency in the af
fairs of the city.

rights of the landowners. President
14elm appointed L. J. Magee, W. E.
Wood and A. C. Johnson members of
the committee.
A letter was read from Project Man
ager Davis which set forth that the
Reclamation Service had no alter
native than to announce the cost of
the water as the books of the Service
now show it to be. This letter decid
ed the board to employ legal counsel
Before adjourning the board of di
rectors passed a resolution thanking

COL. ROOSEVELT WILL
STUMP COUNTRY FOR
NOMINEE HUGHES
Charles Evans Hughes of New York
was nominated for president of the
United States at Chicago .by the Re
publican party. Charles Warren
Fairbanks of Indiana was nominated
for Vice-President.
Mr. Hughes immediately resigned as
a justice of the supreme court and his
resignation was accepted by President
Wilson. Col. Theodore Roosevelt was
nominated by the Progressives but re
fused to accept the nomination. Mr.
Hughes will be acceptable to Col.
Roosevelt and the latter will stump
the country for him. That is the latest
report from eastern political circles.
The platform adopted by the Re
publicans is acceptable to the rank and
tile of the Progressive narty. The Re
publican party is reunited after four
years of separation. The indications
are that Mr. Hughes will sweep the
country in 1916 as Col. Roosevelt
swept tiie country in 1904, Everybody
except the bosses in the two parties
arc satisfied with the results of the
convention. Neither the so-called Old
Guard of the Republican party nor the
politicians of Armageddon were satis
fied, but they will have to make the
best of it.
Rout for Politicians
The results of the Republican con
vention spell rout for the Old Guard
who made a strong fight to name the
candidate and afterwards to retain con
trol of the party machinery. They
were unsuccessful. The voice of the
people was heard at Chicago as it has
never been heard at a national conven
tion before. The nomination of Mr.
Hughes was simply a victory for the
common people of the United States
who had demanded Hughes so per
sistently that the convention did not
dare nominate any other man.
CALDWELL IS DISTRIBUTING
POINT FOR SEVEN STATES
Headquarters for Cole Car—Assem
bly Room to be Built.
Harry Wilson, manager of the
Shank Auto Co., as stated in a pre
vious issue of The Tribune, has pur
chased the lots adjoining the garage.
Mr. Wilson is now having plans drawn
for an addition to the present build
ing. The addition will be used as an
assembling room for automobiles.
The western headquarters for the
Cole car has been located at Caldwell.
This city is the distributing point for
seven states, Idaho, Oregon, Washing
ton, Montana, Wyoming, Utah and
Nevada. A great many men will
be employed at the Caldwell agency.
Saving in Freight.
By shipping the cars knocked down
and assembling them here a great sav»
ing will be effected in freight. The
'Cole car has been very popular in the
cast for a number of years but has not
been well known in the west until the
last couple of years. Mr. Wilson and
associates have met with great success
in introducing the car, and for that
reason were given this entire territory.
Mr. Wilson is confident that he can
build up one of the biggest distribut
ing agencies in the west at Caldwell.
He has already equipped a garage and
machine shop that is as good as any
in the state. His assembling room
will complete the plant.
IVORY TOPS TAKE THE
G. A. R.'S INTO CAMP
The Ivory Tops aitd the G. A. R.'s
met Tuesday evening in one of the
most hotly contested games of the
Twilight league season, the Ivories
finally annexing the motinee by a score
of 5 to 4.
The G. A. R. team led during most
of the game, but the Ivories staged a
rally in the last inning and managed
to slip the winning run across the
plat. Fink was on the mound for the
Ivories during most of the session but
was superceded by Fry in the fifth,
with Webb receiving. Vining and
Kelleher made up the battery for the
G. A. R. bunch.
All three pitchers hurled consistent
ball and received fair sunport, although
errors were responsible for several
runs. The next Twilight league battle
is scheduled for next Tuesday evening,
when the Ivory Tops will clash with
the Juveniles.
TO THE REPUBLICAN
ELECTORS OF IDAHO
In announcing my candidacy for
the renomination to the position of
State Treasurer, 1 ask your support
on my record' since assuming charge
of the office. No favoritism has been
shown any institution or individual
and all the State's money has been
drawing interest for the State all the
time possible. The methods and work
of the office have been so changed and
systematized that an actual saving of
$54,690.32 was made during my first
year. All books and records in the
office are open for inspection at any
time. . ,
If you approve doing the State s
business in that manner, I will cer
tainly appreciate your vote.
Respectfully,
JOHN W. EAGLESON.
Catholic Church.
There will be services at the Catho
lic church Sunday. Mass and sermon
at 9:30 a. m., followed by benediction.
Father F. Ries, S. M.
