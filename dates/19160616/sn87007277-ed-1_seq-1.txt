itr
Federal Recruit Promisee to Be Baseball "Find" of Season.
In bis manner of sliding Into bases Joe Gedeon, the Yankee second base
man recruited from the defunct Federal league, whose phenomenal batting
and fielding bids fair to make him the "baseball find" of the season, differs
entirely from practically every major leaguer now in the game. Gedeon
dives for the bag head foremost, and hooking the bag with one hand, curves
his body as far as possible from the baseman. In this way of "hitting the
ilrt" the runner runs the risk of a spiked hand but avoids the danger of
wrenched and strained ankles. The photograph shows "Joe" Gedeon in his
typical manner of sliding into a base. Pipp, the Yankee first baseman, Is
taking the throw" at the bag.

Frank Isbell, who Is president and

winner of the Western league pennant,
is a noted figure in baseball, as he
was for years the famous second base
man of the Chicago White Sox. He
was born in Dclavan, N. Y., on August
21, 1875, and moved to Minnesota
when a boy. He was with Comiskey
during most of his baseball career,

playing every position on the diamond
at different times. He began as a
pitcher and Joined the St. Paul club in
the fall of 1896. He pitched and
played the outfield there for two years
until he was drafted by the Chicago
Nationals for the season of 1898. He
remained on the West side team until
August, 1898, when he was returned to
St Paul finishing the season in the
outfield. He went to Chicago with
Comiskey's club in 1900 and developed
into a first baseman and then into a
great utility player, and finally into
the club's regular second baseman.
Three years ago he purchased an In
terest in the Wichita club of the West
ern league, and retired from the major
league arena, with Comiskey's con
sent, to give his entire time to the
Wichita club. Then he assumed the
control and management of the Des
Moines club, whose team he then pi
loted to the pinnacle of success.
SOUTHPAWS BACK TO MINORS
Manager Donovan, Well Supplied With
Lefthandere, Sends Finn, Gay and
Meadows Back for Seasoning.
It did not take Manager Bill Dono
van long to decide that three of his

not Intended for fast company, and
he sent Finn, Gay and Meadows back
to the minors. Donovan is going to
be well supplied with southpaws In
the coming campaign, and he was eas
ily satisfied that Mogridge, Cullop,
Love, Markle and one or two others
were the cream of his offside, or south

Arthur Irwin to Retire.
Report has it that Arthur Irwin will
not continue his connection with the

FORCED TO OE SECRET
BIG LEAGUE SCOUTS MUST 00
THEIR WORK UNDER COVER.
Bush Managers Conceived All Sorts of
Ways to Boost Assets Batting
Averages Padded to Make
Players Tempting.
Many good stories are told by big
league scouts and about them. Jim
Murphy, former scout for the Chicago
Nationals, tells one which shows the
value of keeping under cover. The
Marion (O.) club had a player it was
trying to peddle off on the big leagues.
The tip finally reached the Cubs that
here was a splendid player for the top
rung. So Jim Murphy went down to
look him over.
On the day he arrived he took his
seat in the grandstand, unobserved,
and according to his custom Immedi
ately began asking questions about the
youngster.
The fan on his right happened to be
a keen rooter, so Murphy opened up
on him. The talk finally led around
to the man the Cubs were after.
"What kind of a player is So and So?"
inquired Murphy.
"Bill Smith" (name faked for ob
vious reason), exclaimed the fan. "Oh,
Bill's a wonderful fielder, when he
leaves the booze alone," was the un
expected answer. It Is almost need
less to say Murphy took the next train
back home. He had learned all he
wanted In that one short sentence.
On another occasion Murphy was
investigating a player up in Wiscon
sin. Tho manager of the team was do
ing his best to sell the "star" for a big
price, but he knew his man was a
hard drinker and tried to conceal the
fact. So he introduced Murphy to the
player and then started to take the
party on a tour of the saloons in town.
Every time a drink was ordered he
tipped the wink to his player and he
would order a cigar, much to the
amazement of the bartender. He
would Instinctively reach for the bot
tle which the player generally or
dered, as Murphy noticed with an in
ward smile.
And every time said player asked
for a cigar the manager woujd nudge
Murphy and exclaim, "See that? He's
as steady and temperate as they make
them." But any man with half an eye
would .have spotted the player for a
hard drinker. He even had it on his
breath. Murphy finally left town with
out his man.
This Just shows to what means man
agers will go In their anxiety to sell
a player for a good price and make
some profits for the club. There are
even cases where batting averages are
padded to give the impression players
are sluggers, thus making them tempt
ing bait for big-league scouts.
A scout has to be a detective in ad
dition to his other virtues. It is nc
easy Job.
HAS NEW STYLE OF HITTING
George Cutshaw of Brooklyn Hopes te
Increase Batting Average From
.250 to .300 Class.
George Cutshaw, like all good citi
zens, Is ambitious, and to further his
latest ambition he has drilled himself
into a new style of hitting which he
fervently hopes will Jump his batting
average from the .250 class into the
.300 division, or thereabouts. Now
George has discovered that he can be

SCULPTOR MAKES
NEW FACES FOR
WOUNDED MEN
Copper Masks Are Molded by
Francis Derwent Wood, a
British Officer.
REMARKABLE FACIAL SURGERY
Many Pathetic Cases Fall to Care of
Celebrated Artist Spend Months
in Experiments Before At
tending His First Case
New Eye for Soldier.
London. Not "new lamps for old,"
but "new faces for old," is the cry of
the modern Arabian Nights magician.
This magician is a sculptor of renown,
English by birth but halt American by
ancestry.
He is Francis Derwent Wood, a name
familiar in the United States, where
various collectors possess examples of
his work. Wood's steadily growing
fame, however, was extended in Amer
ica just before the war began, when
he was commissioned by Lady Paget
and the duchess of Marlborough on be
half of the American women in Eng
land to execute the statue of William
Pitt, which, as soon as circumstances
make the thing more suitable, will be
presented by them to their native land
in commemoratinn of the hundred
years of peace between this country
and America.
Lieutenant Wood, as he now is, has
discovered how to give new faces to
men who have lost theirs in the war.
He can make new eyes, cheeks, fore
heads, chins; in fact, he Is making
them dally. Up to date Derwent Wood
has made new faces, or at least parts
of faces, for five such victims of war.
Remarkable Facial Surgery.
The most pathetic case of all of
these was that of a trooper named
Everltt, whose face had been broken
by an explosive bullet. His nose had
been carried away almost entirely and
his left cheek torn open from his ear
to the corner of his mouth. Like most
of these victims of facial disfigure
ment, he had to undergo operation
after operation. He received his wound
on May 13 of last year. Finally he was
brought to a London hospital on Sep
tember 2, and up to a couple of weeks
ago, despite the fact that bis wound
had entirely healed and surgery ad
mittedly had done all that It could for
him, he remained a sad sight.
Before the war he was a taxi driver.
Now, made at least presentable by the
wonderful "facial mask" which Wood
has contrived for him, a mask consist
ing of false nose, cheek and a "mus
tache" which conceals his injured lip,
ex-Trooper Everltt Is plying his old
trade again and doing well at it.
"When he saw himself with his mask
for the first time," .said the sculptor,
"he jumped for Joy."
New Eye for Soldiers.
Another case in which Wood has
salved human ' wreckage Is that of
Driver Fergusson, a member of the Ca
nadlan field artillery, who was hide
ously wounded at Ypres on April 25,
1915. A piece of shell carried away his
right eye entirely, and as the surgical
report professionally put it, "the sur
rounding structures." In the ordinary
way, there would have been nothing to
fix an artificial eye "to," and, as in the
case of Trooper BJverltt, his disfigure
ment was so appalling to behold that
it is doubtful of he ever could have
taken up his old trade, which was that
of a machinist.
Now with the upper part of his right
cheek restored, and what appear to be
two perfectly good eyes beaming at
van from behind spectacles, this
SOLDIERS CARRY OWN BATHS
Many Ingenious Device Displayed at
Red Cross Sale in
London.
London.-A.n active service exhibi
tion is being held at Knightsbrldge,
at which are displayed hundreds of in
genious devices for the comfort,
health and safetj' of officers and men
at the front The money raised by
the sale of these' articles goes to
funds of the British' Red Cross and the
Order of St. John of Jerusalem.
Among the device on sale Is a
small safety razor that- will fit easily
into a waistcoat pocket, a compact hot
bath arrangement, together with pat
ent cubes of "condensejd heat, which
will raise the temperature of water to
the proper degree, a shosver-bath out
fit, and other toilet article,.
In order to enable the , oldler to
write In the dark a combl nation pen
cil case and electric torch), to throw
light on the paper, has been invented.
The "nutshell," as one little case Is
called, contains 83 assorted drink tab
lets, tea, coffee, beef tea, and cordial
youngster not only will be able to earn
his living hereafter, but Is going to get
married, and the gratitude af his fian
cee to Derwent Wood is only surpassed
by his own.
These are the two worst cases with
which the sculptor has yet had to deal,
but others in which he has been equal
ly successful are those of Private Har
per of the King's Royal rifles, who also
lost most of his nose and the biggest
part of his cheekbone; Lance Corporal
Davis of the Australian imperial
forces, who was minus an eye and
part of his cheek, and a British private,
whose left cheek and nose were fright
fully torn by a shrapnel bullet All
these men will now be able to follow
their own trades, instead of having to
exist, shunned by all save the most
stoical of their fellows, on the prince
ly pension of 25 shillings ($6) a week,
which is all that their country can af
ford to pay in cases of "total Inca
pacity." Wood's War Service.
Soon after the beginning of the war
Col. Bruce Porter of the Royal Army
Medical corps made a speech to the'
members of the Chelsea Arts club, of
which Derwent Wood la a member.
The colonel asked his hearers to make
a sacrifice of their art, and if they were
too old to fight to accept the lowest
service hi the ranks of the R. A. M. C.
A goodly number of the Chelsea artists
enlisted in the R. A. II C. forthwith,
and among them was Derwent Wood.
At forty-four he is not available for
active service. His father came from
Harrisburg, Pa., married an English
woman and settled down at Keswick,
in Cumberland, where Derwent Wood
was born.
He began his artistic career at
Karlsruhe, later returning to' England,
and becoming a student at the Royal
academy. There he won the gold
medal and the traveling scholarship,
which took him for some time to Italy.
He afterward became assistant to
Thomas Brock, R. A., one of the most
famous of British sculptors. Honors
were awarded hira at the Paris salon.
and four years ago be was made an
associate of the Royal academy. Ex
amples of his statuary are In the pos
session of Henry Phipps, ot his son,
J. Phipps of Westbury, L. I., and sev
eral other well-known American col
lectors.
Moved to Aid Wounded.
Having Joined the R. A. M. C. as an
ordinary private Wood was sent out to
a London military hospital. It is one
of the biggest in the metropolis, with
more than 1,500 beds. At the begin
ning the new orderly's duties were not
of an exalted nature, one of them be
ing to assist In rolling a new asphalt
path. In a few days, however, the
sculptor was drafted Into the wards,
where he began by taking plaster casts
of damaged limbs. He soon became a
master of splints. And in the course
of his work he saw the saddest sights
of the war, the men with the muti
lated faces.
Moved to Intense compassion, Der
went Wood went to his colonel one
day and said: "Let me see what I can
do for these poor fellows. I believe
that I can do something anyway." The
officer consented gladly.
"I spent months In experiments,"
said Wood, "before I undertook my
first case. This was in December last,
my patient being Trooper Everltt. My
