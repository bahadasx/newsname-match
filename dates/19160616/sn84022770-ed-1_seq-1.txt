CM MIS
PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE OF RE
PUBLICANS CONFERS WITH
HIS PARTY LEADERS.
Charles Evan Hughes, Republican
nominee for president, who resigned
from the United Statfes supreme court
laßt Saturday afternoon after hear
ing of his nomination at Chicago,
plunged right Into plans for his cam
paign and has been holding a series
of conferences with party leaders In
New York City this week. As a re
sult, the man who will succeed
Charleß D. Hllles as chairman of the
Republican national committee will
probably be chosen at a conference
set for next Monday.
No statements have been issued by
the presidential candidate since his
telegram accepting the nomination,
except to aver his stand for "undi
luted Americanism." The date for
the occasion of his formal notification
of the nomination and his formal
speech of acceptance, has not been
fixed, being delayed pending the ac
tion of the Progressive national com
mittee, which is scheduled to meet
June 25.
PICKUP
Nomination Perfunctory.
Probably never In the history of
party government has the naming of
a candidate been so perfunctory as
was the nomination of Mr. Justice
Hughes last Saturday afternoon.
Solemnly and with an air of resig
nation the Republican national con
vention nominated Supreme Court
Justice Charles E. Hughes for presi
dent, and Charles Warren Fairbanks
of Indiana for vice president. Hughes
received 949V4 votes out of the 985
In the convention on the first ballot
of the day and the third of the ses
sions. Roosevelt's compromise can
didate Senator Lodge of Massachu
setts, got seven votes-
The taking of the ballot and the
■low swinging of one state after an
other Into the Hughes column was
applauded with the same enthusiasm
that marks the applauding of a
"plugged" vaudeville actor by a
clique in the foyer hired for that pur
pose.
A Solemn Parade.
•When the ballot was taken and the
result was made known, some of the
Hughes delegates arose and paraded
with deep solemnity about the hall.
But though flags were swung and the
band played, there were ripples of
shouts only here and there and at
times the silence was broken only by
the shuffling of feet and the bussing
of conversation.
Frank Hitchcock, who has supplied
most of the craft of the campaign for
Hughes, moved about among the del
egations with sepulchral ofllclousness,
as one who should say:
"Those who wish to view the re
mains will please pass to the right."
Crane Winks Once or Twice.
Murray Crane of Massachusetts
whose shrewd brain discovered that
Hughes alone was strong enough to
prevent the nomination of Roosevelt,
looked straight ahead of him and
said nothing. But once or twice he
winked.
Governor Whitman of New York,
the only militant Hughes man on the
floor, shot out his jaw in the particu
lar manner he employs to denote tri
umph. He did not smile. Smoot,
long and angular, looked from the
platform to Penrose, whose gigantic
form towered over the heads of his
charges In the Pennsylvania delegar
tlon. Penrose looked back at Smoot.
Neither of them looked as if they
were especially pleased with the work
of the day.
The Oregon delegates, refreshed
by the rain, which is their native ele
ment, stood on their chairs for a
while and tried to yell. But when
they heard the echoes of their own
voices reverberate from the circling
rafters they subsided. And soon the
sadness of the occasion Infected all
present and the sounds died away
into a dismal sizzle.
RCSIRBS and Accept* Promptly.
Within the hour after he had re
ceived the telegram telling htm of his
nomination. Hughes had sent his res
ignation from the supreme court to
President Wilson and had issued a
lengthy statement accepting the nom
ination. Within almost as short a
time Roosevelt had telegraphed his
conditional refusal of the Progres

Thurston county has realized a lit

are for the limit of both beer and

The hot weather of the past few
days has resulted In boosting the
number of permits Issued dally to an
average of 25 and the auditor's office
expects to do a rushing business in
this department during the summer

the year the auditor issued 932 per

the various months being: January

DEMOGIUTS 6IMSON MING ENDORSEMENT
PLATFORM CONTAINS RINGING DECLARATIONS OF AMERICANISM
AND PRAISES NATIONAL ADM INISTRATION'S POLICY OF PEACE
AND NEUTRALITY—NATIONAL CONVENTION MOST ENTHUSIAS
TIC AND HARMONIOUS IN YEARS.
Ringing declarations of AmeHctui
j Ism, heartiest endorsement of Presi-
I dent Wilson's administration, hi* trol
ley of neutrality, his foreign policy
and the legislative achievements Of
the past four years, are among the
important planks of the platform
adopted by the Democratic national
convention in St. Louis this week, the
most enthusiastic and harmonious
gathering of the members of this
party for years, which promises to
make by acclamation, at sessions Fri
day night and Saturday night, the re
nominations of President Wilson and
Vice President Marshall.
Much of the platform as adopted
by the convention was drafted by,
President Wilson himself, after con
! sulfations with Senator Stone, chair-
I man of the resolutions committee,
; and other party leaders. An impor
-1 tant section of it was a plank declar
ing for the protection of the rights
of American citizens at home and
(abroad, putting life above property;
| other features were provisions de
| claring for a permanent peace tri-
Jbunal; preparedness; eight-hour day
j for workingmen and civil service pen
; slons. and giving a review of the leg
\ islation enacted during the past four
j years, including reference to the fed-
I eral reserve law, the trade commis
j slon act, the shipping bill, the tariff
I commission bill, rural credits legisla
tion and other measures passed by
congress or now being pressed by the
administration'
"Americanism and Pence."
The convention opened promptly
at noon Wednesday, and at its first
session heard the keynote speeph of
Americanism and peace, prepared
ness and prosperity sounded by for
mer Governor Martin H. Qlynn, of
New York, as temporary chairman
and with a high pitch of enthusiasm
emphatically registered by demon
stration after demonstration its ap
proval of President Wilson's peaceful
conduct of foreign affairs, breaking
forth into a 16-mlnute demonstra
tion when Wilson's re-election was
predicted.
The convention stirred Itself into
roaring cheers as Chairman Olynn
cited historic parallels to show that
other presidents, including Repub
licans, had adjusted threatening for
eign situations without resort to war.
I "The policy of the administration,"
he declared, "has been just as Amer
ican as the American flag itself." He
went down the list of presidents, re
counting their action to avoid war,
the delegates catching the spirit of
his argument, and as he referred to
each particular president some dele
gate would call, "What did he do?"
Makes Convention Roar.
"He settled the trouble by negotia
tion," was the reply which Olynn In
variably returned and the convention
would roar Its approval.
It was plain that the telling points
on the delegates were Ihe recital of
President Wilson's efforts to keep the
country at peace.
"This policy," he said, "may not
satisfy the fire-eater and the swash
buckler. But tt does satisfy the
mothers of the land, at whose hearth
and fireside no jingoistic war haa
placed an empty chair. It does satis
fy the daughters of this land, from
whom bluster and brag have sent no
loving brother to the dissolution of
the grave. It does satisfy the fathers
of this land and the sons of this land,
who will fight for our flag and die
for our flag when reason primes the
rifle, when honor draws the sword
and when justice breathes a blessing
on the standard they uphold."
No other president since the Civil
war, Olynn told the convention, had
faced such crucial problems; none
had displayed a grasp of statesman
ship more profound.
"Whether the course the coun
try has pursued during this cru- '
cial period Is to be continued
and whether the principles that
have been asserted as our na
tional policy shall bo indorsed
or withdrawn," Olynn told the
convention was the paramount
question for the voter to decide.
"No lesser issue must cloud it,"
said he; "no unrelated prob
lems roust confuse it "
Speech by McCombs.
In calling the convention to order,
Chairman William P. McCombs of
the Rational committee referred par
ticularly to the situation in the Re
publican and Progressive parties, say
ing, "We have witnessed a drab spec
tacle of two groups of men trading
principles like competitors In a fish
market in the hope that some com
promise would win public support."
Then, declaring the chief tenet of the
Democratic faith to be that America
is American and Americans are Amer
ica, Mr. # McCombs continued:
"The Democratic party, in the face
of scandalous and vicious attacks, has
maintained the great American ideal
of peace with honor. While for
peace, it has steadily and surely
worked for sound and powerful pre
paredness. It has maintained a sol
emn dignity in the face of circum
stances which might have drawn it
into the vortex of a world destruc
tion. Though vilified by self-seekers,
it has maintained friendly relations
throughout the world; it has been
true to the spirit of America; it has
been true to the great principles -of
Washington, Jefferson, Madison and
Jackson; It has allowed no selfish in
terest to blind it to the fundamentals
of its faith and the country has found
that its confidence has been well
bestowed. The Democratic party has
proved itself a party of principle, a
party of constructive ability, a party
of performance. It has proved that
ideals can be realised. United we
stand for America.
"Ladies and gentlemen of this
great convention, the elephant is
dead, the moose 4s dead- Long live
the American eagle!"
Bryan to Campaign.
Indicative of the harmony prevail
ing in the convention was the state
ment made by Samuel A. King of
Utah before the resolutions commit
tee. "I called on William J. Bryan
today," he said, "and asked if he
would submit any planks. He re
plied: 'I have no planks to offer bat
one, and that Is the president's. De
termine what he wants and his plank
will be mine. I expect to go before
the people In his behalf on your re
port.' "

Though they had felt they should *
not be required to pay more than the
original purchase price of the landa,
from $lO to sl7 an acre, nearly all
local oystermen will take advantage
of the terms fixed by the state oyster
commission and the state fish com-
mission this week whereby holders of
oyster land under the Callow act may
obtain a clear title through the pay
ment to the state of an additional
$25 an acre-
Some 462 out of the 111 acres sold
under the Callow act are already cov
ered by applicationa made to the statf
land commissioner and It is said that
■ore applications will be made, un
til it Is believed that practically all
of the lands held under the Callow
act will be covered. This will mean
the payment to the state, at the di
rection of the present administration,
of from $15,000 to 118,000, or double
the amount received under the orig
inal purchase price.
When the lands were first sold, the
titles contained a provision that they
could be purchased back by the state
at any time, and the oystermen, hin
dered In financing the Improvement*
of their properties by this provision
which was considered a cloud on their
title, succeeded In obtaining a law
from the last legislature permitting
them to obtain complete title to the
lanils upon payment of an additional
amount, which was fixed by the state;
commissions this week.
The new title will still contain the
provision that the lands revert to the
state If not used for growing oyster*.
