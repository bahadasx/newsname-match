St. Louis. June IS. After an un
successful fight to throw out the suf
frage plank in the Democratic plat
form as approved by President Wil
son, the Democratic national conven
tion at 3:09 o'clock this afternoon
adopted the whole platform, includ
ina the planks on suffrage and Amer
icanism hy acclamation.
The fight on the suffrage plank was
the first row to ripple the harmony
ot the convention. The fight on it
was led by Governor Ferguson of
Texas, and it seemed to have some
chance until Senator Walsh of Mon
tana told the convention that Presi
dent Wilson considered the suffrage
plank as written necessary to the suc
cess of the party.
"The majority plank is not the be
lief, not the conviction of the Demo
cratic party." said Governor Ferguson
in his speech, "and in the desire to
secure a little political advantage, this
filial surrender of Democratic prin
ciples is made."
While the argument was going on,
William J. Bryan, fearful that one of
inn rreupt the business of the conven
thv recurrent demonstrations might
interrupt the business of the conven
tion left his seat and took a position
under the speaker's stand where he
coulu not be seen by the crowd but
sti'l could hear the discussion.
The Texas governor pleaded elo
quently tor the convention not to lay
aside old and honored principles of
the Democratic party regarding state
riKhts. "Agitation for euual suffrage." Gov
ernor Ferguson said, "was sweeping
over the country when the women
should be performing the functions for
which God Almighty intended her."
Mingled applause and hissing fol
lowed his conclusion. Senator Stone j
followed, supporting the majority re-
port.
A roll call of the states was forced
and only 181 M: votes could be mus
tered for the substitute; 882 were
cast against it. The plank itself and
th.- whole platform were adopted by a
roaring chorus of approval.
Kansas cast her twenty votes
against the minority report.
Alter some formality the convention
then adjourned at 3:11 o'clock. It was
all over.
A His Scrap Breaks.
St. Louis, June 16. That the Dem
ocrat national convention, placid as a
sunny sky today, is not to pass without
a real scrap, became apparent this
afternoon when the minority of the
resolutions committee submitted a re
port on woman suffrage, opposing the
plank adopted by the full committee
this morning. The vote on the suf
frage plank was 25 to 20, favoring the
state supervision of the enfranchise
ment of women. The tentative plank
demanding a national amendment for
suffrage was lost by a majority of
three votes.
After the reading of the platform,
before the convention. Governor Fer
guson of Texas took the platform and
ofiered a minority report on the suf
frage plank. The champion of the
suffrage cause was heralded with
much cheering.
Apparently desiring to sidestep the
direct vote on the suffrage cause,
many of the delegates deserted, having
gone home.

MEET ONCE MORE
Conference Between Union and
Big Four in August.
After That Only Jleans Will Be
General Strike.
New York. June 1 6. Preliminary
negotiations between the heads cf the
"big four" railway brotherhoods and
the national conference committee of
the railways have come to an end. The
railroads refused the union's demands
and suggested arbitration by the in
terstate commerce commission or by
umpires appointed under the New
lands act.
A. B. Garretson, erand chief of the
Order of Railway conductors and
spokesman for the union, refused
these suggestions.
"If the offers did appeal to us." Mr.
Garretson said, "it would be impos
sible to accept them at the present
tunc. There is nothing for us to do
but to go back to the men. They will
never go into an arbitration in which
there are embodied principles that
deprive them of selling their time to
the companies."
In its formal letter of declination of
the unions' terms, the conference com
mitee of the railways said:
Ixttter by Committee.
"The present rates and rules are
largely the result of recent arbitration
awards and in our judgment now pro-
demonstration that followed his nom
ination at the end of a telephone wire
that extended to the speaker's stand.
A megaphone was attached to the re
ceiver in the Coliseum. Fred B. Lynch
of Minnesota notified him at the In
stant of his nomination.
On This Platform.
Wilson and Marshall will be sent
into the campaign on a platform
which declares: .
For Americanism antl against
hyphenated Americanism.
For the enfranchisement of women
by the states.
For a continuance of the present
policy in Mexico.
For a continuance of the president's
foreign policy.
For all the declarations of the Balti
more platform save , the anti-second
term plank and the plank favoring the
exemption of tolls for American ships
passing through the Panama canal.
These are definitely dodged in the pre
amble of the declaration.
Uproar Forty-Five Minutes.
A demonstration lasting fortv-five
minutes followed the placing of Wil
son's name before the convention by
Judge Wescott of New Jersey. The
same jurist made the nominating
speech at Baltimore four years ago.
Many brief second speeches were
made from states considered doubtful
in the coming campaign. Judson Har
mon, who opposed the president at
Baltimore as a rival candidate, made
a seconding speech.
The nomination of Marshall was
unanimous. All the several aspirants
for the honor withdrew, including
Roger Sullivan of Chicago and Gov
ernor Major of Missouri.
Such enthusiasm as there was en
dured but for a few minutes. The big
demonstration was palpably forced by
ine leaaers. .
During its Drosress the delegations
of New York. Illinois, part of Massa
chusetts, part of New Jersey stub
bornly retained their seats.
T he nomination was rushed throueh
at the last minute. Senator Hughes of
ew jersey moved the nomination be
made by acclamation as soon as Har
mon's seconding speech was concluded.
Quarrel Delays Platform.
After the incident of Burke's neg
ative vote. Senator Kern nominated
Marshall. That nomination went
through by acclamation. There was
no opposition.
A quarrel over some of the planks
in the platform prevented a report of
the platform committee when the
nominations had been made. It was
reported that the president, to whom
the planks have been read one by one
over the telephone, insisted on a
strong anti-hyphenated plank and that
he wanted the convention kept in ses
sion until he could address it.
This was flatly denied by Chair
man James. It was clear, however,
that a failure to meet the president's
platform requirements was holding up
the platform. The subcommittee
which drafted the platform had done
its work. But the full committee had
not all assembled at 1 o'clock. Some
of them were still in conference with
the president.
St. Louis, June 16. The full resolu
tions committee adopted ' the Demo
cratic platform as submitted by the
sub-committee, today, and Senator
Stone read the document before the
convention following the opening at
11 a. m. today.
A few minor changes were made in
the original draft and the only snag
struck by the platform builders was
the woman suffrage plank. This was
carried before the convention on a
minority report submited by Gover
nor Ferguson of Texas. By a vote of
25 to 22 the resolutions opposed the
proposed plank for a national
frage amendment.
The platform as submitted by
committee follows:
The St. Louis Platform.
"The Democratic party in national
convention assembled, adopts the fol
lowing declaration to the end that the
people of the United States may both
realize the achievements wrought by
four years of Democratic administration
and be apprised of the policies to
which the party is committed for the
further conduct of national affairs:
"We endorse the administration of
Woodrow Wilson. It speaks for itself.
It is the best exposition of sound Dem
ocratic policy at home and abroad.
"We challenge comparison of our
record, our keeping of pledges, and
our constructive legislation, with those
of any party of any time.
"We found our country hampered
by special privileges, a vicious tariff,
obsolete banking laws and an In
elastic currency. Our foreign affairs
were dominated by commercial inter
ests for their selfish ends. The Re
publican party, despite repeated
pledges, was impotent to correct
abuses which it had fostered. Under
our administration under a leadership
which has never faltered, these abuses
have been corrected and our people
have been freed.
Makes Panics Impossible.
"Our archaic banking and currency
system, prolific of panic and disaster
under Republican administrations
long the refuge of the money trust
has been supplanted by the federal
reserve act, a true democracy of credit
under government control, already
proved a financial bulwark in a world
crisis, mobilizing our resources, plac
ing abundant credit at the disposal of
legitimate industry and making a cur
rency panic impossible.
"We have created a federal trade
commission to accommodate the per
plexing questions arising under the
anti-trust laws so that monopoly may
be strangled at its birth and legitimate
industry encouraged. Fair compete
tion in business is now assured. We
have effected an adjustment of the
tariff, adequate for revenue under
peace conditions, and fair to the con
sumer and to the producer.
"We have adjusted the burdens of
taxation so that swollen incomes bear
their equitable share. Our revenues
have been sufficient in. times of world
stress.
Uplift for Labor.
"We have lifted human labor from
the category of commodities and have
secured to the working man the right
of voluntary association for bis pro
tection and welfare.
"We have protected the rights of
the laborer against the unwarranted
issuance of writs of injunction and
have guaranteed to him the right of
trial by jury in alleged contempt cases,
committed outside the presence of
the court.
"We have advanced the parcel post
to genuine efficiency, enlarged the
postal savings system added ten thou
sand rural delivery routes and exten
sions, thus reaching two and one-half
millions additional people, improved
the postal service in every branch and
I placed the postoffice system on a self-
supporting basis with actual surplus

WILLIAM ALLEN WHITE.'
Copyright, 1916, George Matthew Adams.
St. Louis, June 16. Senator OHie
James started the thing to bubbling
when he referred to the president's
diplomatic victory over Germany. At
first the delegates did not understand
what he said, and greeted his remarks
with a perfunctory cheer. Then some
one yelled "repeat it," and slowly Sen
ator James mounted to his climax and
jumped off again. When he referred
to Emperor William as "the most mil
itant spirit that ever brooded over a
battle field, and boasted of all Presi
dent Wilson had made the emperor
yield, the crowd's enthusiasm shot up
like a sky-rocket and stayed in the
air fifteen minutes, while state dele
gations surrounding their state pen
nants, marched around the room, sa
luted the orator and raised all the dis
turbance a thousand men on foot with
free-born American lungs can raise
when they feel like it.
The band contributed in its feeble
way; pumping Dixie which had not )
been played during the earlier session
of the convention, and "The Battle
Cry ' of Freedom," and "The Star
Spangled Banner" into the noise. And
then as the noise began to ebb, at the
suggestion of some patriot who was
looking after the ticket in November,
the band played "Onward Christian
Soldier," but no one sang. They
could not quite follow Bryan that far.
But the crowd got the point and after
quiet was restored,, the crowd set up
a cry for Its old leader. - i
"Bryan," yelled the delegates, in a
barbaric yawp of acclaim. For ten
minutes it cried its heart - out, and
Bryan in modesty fled from the press
box to an engagement at the City club.
Not until the chairman announced
that the delegates would have an op
portunity to hear Mr. Bryan later did
the demand for him subside. He is
still a power of the first class in the
Democratic party. Without him no
candidate can win this year. And he
has told his friends freely taht he ex
pects to be with the president In this
fight.
After the Bryan demonstration, the
crowd rose easily to any demand upon
its voice. Its emotions had been in
covered. It had found itself and was
ready to express itself as a unit From
that moment until the end it was an
unterrified, old fashioned Democratic
convention. As the platform was
read, the crowd punctuated it with
yips of approval and chortles of de
light. And later as the crowd settled
down for business, it was evident that
the delegates had come to enjoy them
selves and had brought their joy with
them. It was a radiant, good natured,
unanimous convention, easily uncork
ed, but tremendously full of fizz.

This means that the union officers

Emporia, Kan., June 16. At the
end of the first 18 holes of the final
play for the state golf championship
between I. Felix and Harlow Hurley,
both of Topeka, indications were that
Hurley would win the title in easy
style. Hurley finished the 18 holes 6
up on his opponent and appeared to
be playing In his best form.
Felix did not show the same form
this morning that he did Thursday
against the 1915 champion, Tom Grif

was more uncertain.
Hurley's total score was 86 for the

.68 Rain's;
other Bourbon leaders in the sunflow
er state believe the James speech will
be a ten strike with .the women voters
and several hundred thousand copies
of the speech will be printed and dis
tributed in Kansas.
Sapp's plan to put the James
speech in- general circulation is the
firstintfmation of the general campaign
plan of the Kansas Democrats It be
came apparent today that Sapp will
make a fight for the woman vote in
home state. Through appeals similar
to the stirring remarks of the Ken
tucky senator. Colonel Sapp hopes to
save a safe Democratic majority for
the Democratic national ticket in
Kansas and deliver the state to Wil
son, as well as return the six Demo
cratic congressmen.
"That ajmes speech will catch the
woman vote flat footed," was the pre
diction of one widely known Kansas
Democrat. "It is Just the thing we
want for our national campaign. My
guess Is that the James speech will be
used extensively in every suffrage
state. It will go to the Kansas women
early in the campaign and if the opin
ion of the delegates and state leaders
attending the convention amount to
anything, it will be an effective cam
paign document."
The James speech and other similar
documents will be sent to the women
under the theory that the women
voters are more generally opposed to
extensive preparedness policies and
war demonstrations. The James
speech is a most emphatic appeal to
the voters not to change horses in
the middle of the stream and to con
tinue a policy which has prevented
hostile relations with other nations.
Senator William H. Thompson of
Kansas is in the real hero class. Kan
sans have taken the spotlight in the
national conventions on various oc
casions during the last two weeks, but
Senator Thompson is the one Kansas
man who has won recognition as a
real, true, honest to goodness hero.
As Senator Thompson left the
Planters hotel after a late night ses
sion with the resolutions committee,
he saw a 3-year-old child run from
the sidewalk and start across the
street. - At the same time the Kansas
senator saw a big touring car swing
around a corner in a manner that
threatened the life of the little tot.
Senator Thompson jumped in front of
the machine, seized the child and lift
ed it from danger, as a badly frighten
ed motor driver brought his car to a
standstill.
The child had wandered onto the
street unaccompanied at a late hour.
After turning the child over to the
poi;ce. Senator Thompson turned to
the driver of the machine. As the
doer of the W was opened he found
tliat Samuel B. Amidon of Wichita
and Dan Callahan of Wicfiita, two
delegates to the national convention
fxoxn Kansas, were passengers in the
car. - Except for the prompt action vf
the senator it is probable that the
ch.'la would have been run down.
More than half of the delegates and
convention visitors will leave St. Louis
tonight for their homes. Others will
spend Saturday in the big town and
return to Kansas Sunday. Following
St. Louis, June 16. The renomina
tion of President Woodrow Wilson and
Vice President Thomas R. Marshall by
the Democrat national convention set
a record unprecedented in the history
of the party in that the standard hear
ers of the organization were named
before the party platform was
adopted.
The opening session of the conven
tion today at 11 o'clock is to dispose
of the platform job at once. Senator
Stone announced late last night that
the drafting of the platform by the
sub-committee was completed, but the
perfected platform was too late to go
before the convention session last
night.
President Wilson's name was placed
before the convention by John W.
Wescott, attorney general of New Jer
sey, in a comparatively brief speech.
Vice President Marshall was nomi
nated by Senator Kern in a speech
that again upset all party precedents
in that it consisted of but ten words.
Senator Kern simply said:
"I nominate Thomas Riley Mar
shall, of Indiana, for vice president.1
Although the vote on Wilson wss
made by acclamation with a belief that
it would be unanimous, there was.
however ,one dissenting vote. . It war
voiced by Robert Emmett Burke, of
Illinois, making the vote technically,
1,091 to 1. ,
The boomlets for vice president by
favorite sons faded away entirety, not
one of them seeing any hope breasting
the avalanch of sentiment for Marshall
which followed President Wilson's "O.

Nearly 100 Kansans jumped at an
invitation to see the St. Louis Browns'
and Washington American league
teams play ball Thursday afternoon,
when some one offered the tip that
Walter Johnson, the famous Washing
ton pitcher and former Kansan. would
be in the box for the Senators. But
Johnson didn't pitch. Nearly all of
the delegates had been too busy to
read the box scores of the previous
day which showed that Johnson had
worked against the Chicago White Sox
and was not due for slab service in
the Democratic convention town. ' '
Kansans added zest to the press
club show at Delmar garden when
they invaded big resort garden and
aioused the newspaper men and dele
gates with the world famed "Rock
Chalk, Jay Hawk. K. U." yell. Dele
gates and news writers took up the
Kansas university yell and for a time
tiio cabaret show was stopped while
delegates, newspaper men and per
formers responded to the Kansas
cheer leaders.
St. Louis newspaper men showed
rare wisdom in avoiding every indica
tion of a talk fest at the press club
frolic. The Chicago greeting to the
visiting news men carried numerous
speeches and refresh rqents. In Kt
Louis a high grade cabaret was sub
stituted for speeches and with the of
fering of famous St. Louis refresh
ments, the party was kept under a full
head of steam until 1 o'clock in the
morning. Nearly all of the visiting
newspaper men and several hundred
convention delegates were guests of
the St. Louis Press club at its feature
performance.
