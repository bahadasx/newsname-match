NUMBER 49
Hughes and Fairbanks
: One of the most noted conven
tions in the history of the repub
lican party la3t Saturday ended
in the selection of Justice Charles
E. Hughes of New York for pres
ident and Charles W. Fairbanks
of Indiana for vice-president,
The third ballot was needed to
select Hughes, but only one was
taken in the almost unanimous
vote for vice-president.
The progressive party, (what
ever that may mean) also at
about the same minute, selected
T. Roosevelt and a man named
Parker of Louisiana for its cand
idates. 1
' This is the first time in "the
history of either party since nom
inations have been made by del
egated conventions, where a man
was selected who was not a can
didate and really and truly did
not want the nomination. Not
less than a dozen candidates had
been before the people, through
bureaus and workers, but Hughes
had hone, and it was claimed
would not accept if nominated.
In the face of all these facts, the
great silent heart of the republi
can party said he was the man
fort the hour. Their delegates
could not be stampeded by the
galleries filled with' hooters for
every man but Hughes. It is the
first instance since the days of
the noted Cincinnatus, who was
called from the plow and re
sponded. Mr. Hughes responded
to the call as a duty to his coun
try, rather than an honor to him
self. In an hour he had sent his
resignation to Pres. Wilson and
his note of acceptance, to the con
vention. The act of first shed
ding the judicial ermine before
he dipped his pen in his letter of
acceptance, shows the man of
action, propriety and patriotism.
The able men of the nation have
in all time past, regardless of
party, ".. proclaimed Hughes a
strong, able, and , conscienciokis
statesman. He wears no man's
collar, but as governor of New
York selected the best man for
every appointment. He is strict
ly a candidate selected by the
peopls and against the united
efforts of the big men who ma
nipulate conventions, v
Roosevelt wisely and patriot
ically declined the nomination of
the progressives, which leaves
that party like any animal . with
its head cut off. :- A few dying
kicks and all is over.; A few
will vote for Wilson butnina out
of every ten will go back to . the
fold. , Really, most of the party
were at Chicago anyhow. -'
With a practically united party
under the leadership of men like
Hughes and Fairbanks, Mr. Wil
son or any, other democrat has,
in street parlance, a man's job on
his hands.' ' - " .

LETTER $
Editor Independent:
Music has always been a delight to
mt; real, harmonious music, coming
from the soul, and of course, going
to the soul not the wretched jingle
of eoon song, ragtime and fox-trots
which have engulfed the Bong market
of recent yean. ' In my childhood we
had few songs, but those few were
Bimple and sweet; we knew and loved
them all. Father used to Bing to us
about "Ben Bolt", and "Johnnie Fill
up the Bowl", and a number, of war
tunes were his favorites. Mother
liked Wesley's song of "Our life as a
dream, our time as a stream;" "Old
Uncle Ned," and a funny song about
the man who milked a vicious cow,
who was always kicking the milker,
till "At last she gave him a kick on
the shin that sent the blood to his
toes." The cow was named Stinnie
and we had a cow named for
her, - Both mother and . father
loved the songs in the old Southern
Harmony, a book printed in the
' seven-shaped notes, Seme of these
(anei were to i minor key, very dole
ful and sad, and full of the wrath to
come, Une in particular used to
strike very forcibly. It declared that
nothing could bribe approaching
death ."from glittering roofs and
downy bed." Another pictured the-
end of sinners: "On slippery rocks I
see them stand, while fiery billows
ro-o-o-o-1-1-1 below." A magnificent
composition beginning: "The trumpet,
the trumpet! the dead have all
huard" was a favorite, and father
could sing it well. And the countless
tunes I have heard since cannot erase
the simple songs of piety sung by my
mother, often in her sorrow and lone
liness, when father was away and she
could not know whether his enemies,
who had not forgiven him for his war
activities, would let him come home
alive; "It is all glory, glory, in that
heavenly land," and "0, what must it
be to be there ;" these melodies might
now be smiled at by real musicians
who did not hear her sing them to us
in those far-off days, gathered around
her knees, when the glory seemed
much nearer to us than it is now.
And sweetest of all, the lisping ac
cents of the baby brother, 'Herschel,
who at three years of age was taken
from us; he ojnuld even then follow
us in singing "Immensity," the first
verse beginning:
."There Is a land we have not seen, -
Tlint time shall never dare destroy;
Where mortal footstep hath not been,
Nor eur hath heard Its sound qf joy."
The little fellow was destined to see
it before any of us. Let us believe
that he found it as in the second
verse: . ' "
"It is a region lovelier far
Than prophets tell or poets sing;
Brighter than summer's beauties are,
And softer than the tints of spring."
Even in old age, my parents could
not bear to hear this sung, and could
not speak of him without tears. He
was the brightest of the family. My
father taught him Greek words, which
he coold repeat perfectly, and it may
be believed that if he had lived,
Herschel would have attained re
nown, liut ne also missed much sor
row. Dr. Job Bell was our physician I
then, but he himself has gone to the
home of the great Physician of all
A tender, good man he was, and we
loved him.
i I have heard world-famous pian
sts, organists, Bingers," and other
musicians; have listened many a time
to the unrivalled music of the United
States Marine Band, playing in the
White House grounds at Washington !
the highest productions of the great
est composers, such as Bethoven,
Bach, Mendelssohn,' Mozart, Verdi;
and Ohcpin; nave heard exquisite
sounds produced by ( various instru
ments and by the best singers. But
never again can my being thrill ' in
this life,' to the concord of sweet
sounds, as it did in my childhood when
I heard Uncle Lattimore Sanders play
his famous fiddle, and listened to
Aunt Kate (now Mrs. Robert Lut
trell) strike the first notes on her
melodeon. I would go a bng way to
hear again a tune like The Devil's
Dream as my uncle pjayed it. Even
his tuning up of the instrument was
a delight, the promise of the feast to
come; the head, with its keys, seemed
a work, of high art; the -gleaming
back was' of classic beauty, the S holes
in front smiled at me, and the bow
was a wand of magic. The Arkansas
Traveler and Roy's Wife were full of
dignity and fire; Pop Goes the Weazel
was charming and funny; the Drunk
ard's Hiccough I thought must be
true to lifi, although I had never seen
a drunkard. The Devil's Dream raised
me to the seventh heaven, and by the
time Buonaparte's Retreat had been
sounded, I was ready to creep into a
corner and cry. . Uncle Lattimore
would come sometimes with an im
mense turkey gobbler hanging down
his back, for he was a mighty hunter
as well as fiddler, and wild turkeys
were then plentiful; but no promise of
table glories could compare with the
joyous message contained in the sound
of tuning up that wonderful fiddle as
he came up the hill. .
What is the best music in the
world that which, by common con
sent, puts it ahead of all the rest?
Napoleon was the greatest general
that history tells of; St Paul was the
greatest preacher; Edison the great
est inventor; Rafael the foremost
painter; Phidias the finest scqlptor;
Paganina ' the most accomplished
violinist, Franz List' the finest of all
pianists, Johann Sebastian Bach the
greatest of all composers, Shakespeare
the king of all poets, etc. There are
many standards of greatness. Popu
larity alone is not the final test, al
though permanency of favor may ' be.
The melody of the song; "There is a
happy land, far, far away" is three
thousand years old. Many of the
smaller compositions of Bach (as his
melody for the G string)," Mozart,
Haydn and others, are still in high
favor. I will have to say, here, what
I think is the sweetest music. There
is much of it that I admire, but there
is one, of course, finer than all the
rest. That is the Sextette from
Lucia di Lammermoor, by the Italian
composer, Donizetti. I can never
hear this without a delicious shiver,
and without wishing I might hear it
by the hour. No words can describe
it. Next, perhaps, is Titl's Serenade,
a pioce of Austrian music. When my
father first beard this, on a Victrola
machine, he could hardiy restrain his
tears, for, he said, he had not con
ceived that there could be such beau
tiful sounds on this earth. Another
Serenade, that of Moszkowski (an
other Austrian), and My Hero from
the Chocolate Soldier, are high in my
favor; also, the Troubadour Nocturne
and Funeral March of Chopin, Ave
Maria by 1 Bach-Gounod-, The ballet
music of Faust fay Gounod. Kamen
noi Ostrow (The Stony Island, in Rus
sian) by Anton Rubinstein, presents a
series of pictures almost as plain to
the ear as landscapes are to the eye;
a marvelous production that I can
never get enough of.
There is a world of music in the
compositions of Giuseppe Verdi. In
his II Trovatore alone, there is enough
of beauty and richness to make the
fame of any composer.. Just think of
the wonderful Tower Song and
Miserere (Ah, I have sighed to rest
me), the duet about going home to
the mountains, the great Anvil Cho
rus, and a whole string or other
things! A great composer was Verdi.
There are no such writers now living.
Mendelssohn wrote his v exquisite
Rondo Capriccioso at the age of fif
teen; '" Mozart composed orchestral
pieces at nine. Schubert, author of
the immortal Serenade, wrote more
than 600 songs; Rossini, whose music
is simply glorious (listen to his Stabat
Mater, and especially to Cujus Ani-
mam and Inflaraatus!) quit writing at
37 years of age and lived 39 years
longer, making a glutton of himself.
All of these great men, with all their
priceless gifts to man, never earned
in all their lives as much as has been
made by the miserable 'tone-tinker,
Irving Berlin, of this city, author of
Everybody's Doin' It" "In My Harem,"
and other abominations. His re
ceipts from the first-mentioned piece
of rot were over $75,000, 'and
any' rag-time jingle he may choose to
put on the market will bring him from
?25,OOOsto $75,000. There is no de
nying a certain ingenuity about this
carpenter of trashy songs, yet he
cannot write music nimself, nor even
play, except with one hand; he in
vents the music, and then gets some
accomplice to do the rest. He is not
yet forty, but his income is far above
that of the president of the United
States. He is a Russian Jew by birth,
and knows how to keep his money,
but it is sickening to see how such
stuff as this can take hold of our
people.- There is no other country in
the world where he could "put such a
thing over " as they say here.
Why is music beautiful; why are
some tones more pleasing than others?
This is a deep question. I started to
solve it by analyzing some of those
a ng?, such as The Last Rose of Sum
mer, Annie Laurie, Kathleen Mavour-
neen, La Paloraa. Juanita, Home,
Sweet Home, and other melodies
which have been sung aronnd the
globe, and never grow old. I then
discovered that there is a key-note in
all these pieces, a note which is used
much more than any other sound.
That is the the third note; the key of
E in the scale of C-natural. Practi
cally no melody of any fame fails to
show a preponderance of this sound.
In some songs it runs as high as
from fifteen to twenty-five per cent,
of the whole. Why is this note Bo
essential to the pleasing of our sense
of harmony?
Because, it makes i combination,

with the accompanying notes, which
vibrates in unison with the sensorium
of our natures. Go into a small room;
run over the scale of notes in a good,
strong voice, and presently one note
will sound much louder than the rest;
you have then struck the key-note of
that room, and it will vibrate in
unison with your voice. Our natures
are sounding-boards which respond to
certain combinations of sound, and it
so happens, under the mysterious laws
of nature' that the third note, when
its status is fixed by accompanying
chords, is the one that touches us
most nearly, for it raises echoes in us
that nothing else does. I now speak
of our own race. The Chinese love
sounds that are not pleasing to us,
and the Russians, just now leading
the world in music, are fond of minor
chords. Let us all cultivate good
music.
One little story must close this
sketch, already rather too long. Most
of us know and love the song ."Nellie
Gray." In Washington I met a lady
in the pension office who knew' the
author of this touching song. He was
a young man, Ben Hanby, who lived in
a little town in Ohio He was an or
ganist in the church, and often com
posed pretty songs. " , He sent "Nellie
Gray" to a publishing house in Boston,
but did not get any word in reply.
About a year later, he went to a music
store in his' own town and ' asked for
some good pieqe q play. tThe clerk
showed him what he said was the lat
est great hit, that was being sung on
both sides of the 'ocean' To his in
tense surprise, young Hanby "saw it was
his own composition of "Nellie Gray."
He wrote to the publishers- (whose
name I do not now mention, for
they are still in business) and got this
letter in reply; "Dear Sir; You have
the fame of Nellie Gray, and we have
the money." " Not a cent "did he get
for this fine song, one of the best of
its kind, and he died poor, under the
age of thirty, like all of his brothers,
with consumption, while his work still
is sung, not only - "in a low green
valley, on the old Kentucky shore,"
but wherever our language is spoken.
Truly, Hanby has made fame, but I
don't think the money the publishers
made out of him will do them much
good. ' ' ' '

COOPER TO PROVE
FAMOUS THEORIES
Celebrated Medicine Accomplish
ing Remarkable. Results. in
Leading Cities. .
.
Referring to the recent visit to At
lanta of L. T. Cooper, the man who
electrified the larger cities of the
country with his philanthropy, health
theories and celebrated medicine, Tan
lac, G. F. Willis, his southern repre
sentative, said :
"Thousands of the most prominent
people in Atlanta, Birmingham, Nash
ville, Chattanooga. Louisville, Knox
ville and other cities where bis cel
ebrated medicine has been accomplish

ing such remarkable results, are even
more enthusiastic over Tanlac than
Mr. Cooper himself.
"As previously stated, Mr. Cooper
contends that nine-tenths tf the dis
eases and ill-health of the average per
son is due to a catarrhal condition
which produces faulty digestion and
improper assimilation of the food.
"In a recent interview Mr. Cooper
was asked if Tanlac would relieve kid
ney trouble, liver complaint, rheuma
tism and a dozen other ailments, and
in this connection said:
"As I have repeatedly said, my
medicine acts directly on the mucus
membrane, stomach and blood, expell
ing from them the impurities and
rendering to them a strong, healthy
condition. I am convinced that the
stomach regulates the condition of
the blood, and is the fountain head
of health or disease, as the case may
be. My medicine is intended Drima-
rily for the regulation of the stomach
and catarrhal inflamation, but it ia
no uncommon thing for persons who
have used it to come to me and ex
plain that it has releived them of
Rheumatism and many otner ailments
not generally recognized as - having
their origin in stomach trouble. -I
"The ingredients ' or medical ele
ments which make Tanlac come from
many remote sections of the earth
the Alps, the Pyrenees, Russian Asia,
West Indies, MountainStates, near the
Rocky Mountains, '. Mexico and Peru
are among the points from which the
principal parts of the preparation are
obtained. In the principal laboratory
of the Cooper Medicine Co., Inc., un
der the efficient direction of Herr Jos
Von trimbach,'.a i native ' German
qhemiat of note, these medicinal
herbs, roots and barks are assembled
in the rough and painstakingly de
veloped so as to ' attain that high
standard of efficiency shown by the
uniform preparation of Tanlac." -
': In referring to the unprecedented
demand for Tanlac in Atlanta. Mr.
Chas. A. Smith, Manager of the
Jacobs' Pharmacy Co., said:
"I have been in the drug business
in Atlanta 25 years, and not in my ex
perience have we , handled anything
that even approaches Tanlac as a sell
er. In less than five weeks' time we
have sold and distributed through
out- eleven stores over 9,000 bottles,
and on la3t Saturday alone over 400
people called at our stores to obtain
the medicine. Judging from" the re
peat sales and the many expressions
of satisfaction from those who have
actually tested Tanlac, the prepara
tion must be something of extraordi
nary merit"' '
Tanlac is sold in Selmer exclusively
by Browder Bros.; in Adamsville by
Abernathy's Pharmacy; in Bethel
Springs by T. S. Davis; in Ramer by
A. B. Hamm & Co.; in Chewalla by
G. W. Parsons. adv
