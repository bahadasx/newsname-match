WILSON AND
MARSHALL
Renominated By Democrats Amid
Scenes of Great Enthusiasm
At St. Louis Convention
St. Louis, Mo., June 16. Presi
dent Wilson and Vice President
Marshall were nominated by accla
mation Thursday night by the Dem
ocratic national convention. Con
trary to expectations, however, the
convention did not finish its work be
cause the platform was not ready and
it met again at 11 o'clock Friday
morning. It was announced in the
convention that the subcommittee
drafting the platform had finished
its work but that the entire resolu
tions committee was not assembled
to pass upon it. President Wilson s
own plank charging conspiracy
among some foreign-born citizens for
the benefit of foreign powers and de
nouncing any political party which
benefits and not repudiates such a
situation was-incorporated into the
platform just as the president him
self had sent it from Washington. It
was understood that the president
insisted that the plank should be put
in the platform the way he had drawn
it. Senator James, of Kentucky, was
elected by the convention to be chair
man of the committee to notify the
nominee for president.
William Jennings Bryan, by the
vote of two-thirds of the delegates
addressed the convention when it re
convened for the night session Thurs
day. In a speech lasting 45 minutes
the Nebraskan reviewed the achieve
ments of the administration and
praised the united party spirit shown
at the convention with which the
democrats will go to the polls in No
vember. .
A great ovation was given benator
Ollie James during. his address to the
delegates as permanent chairman of
the convention. He was frequently
interrupted by applause and was con
gratulated upon his masterly effort.
The draft of the platform is about
4,000 words in length and includes
planks on Americanism, preparedness
and woman's suffrage. President
Wilson heard that a fight was being
made against the plank on American
ism as he had outlined it and wired
to his leaders at St. Louis that he
would not consent to any change.
The oratorical gem of the conven
tion was the speech of the temporary
chairman, former Gov. Martin H.
Glynn, of New York at the opening
nf Vin ennvpntinn on Wednesday.
Amid inspiring scenes, a riot of pa-
XriOtlBIU, imwuiijr -...j, -
mocracy at the opening oi its ZZa
national convention spoke its voice
to the nation. Its orator and oracle.
Gov. Glynn, swayed all shades of
democrats, radicals and conserva
tives, with the story of how the pres
ident had preserved peace with hon
or in accordance with the traditions
of the Americanism of the fathers. It
was not hysteria of the Progressives
for their late popular idol, Theodore
Roosevelt, nor yet the studied 'and
symmetrical plan of the republican
conclave at Chicago that dominated
the initial session. The outbursts
were of a spontaneous nature for a
condition of peace rather than for a
man; for Woodrow Wilson as the ex
ponent of the policy of negotiation
rather than an appeal to arms.
Strangely enough the portion of the
Glynn message which pleased the au
dience most and the words on which
12,000 persons hung with deepest in
terest were a seemingly dry recital
of history. It was animated and en
livened, however, by one short clause
which the speaker with cunning skill
injected into each period. He told
the story of former outrages on
American rights covering administra
tions of national heroes and said:
"But we didn't go to war. We set
tled our troubles by negotiation just
as the President is trying to do to-
For length of demonstrations oth
er conventions have far surpassed
the one on which mingled emotions
played. ' For wild outbursts of feel
ing other political gatherings have
excelled, but for display of purpose
to rebuke the martial spirit and still
-Ui ;nc;i;rmc inspirations on national
honor within, first place must be ac
corded to the assemblage at St. Lou
is. From the press stand, where he
was working as a reporter, William
Jennings Bryan, flag in hand, led the
applause. Conservative delegates
who dominate the body, accepted his
leadership as chief of those who are
standing for the methods of peace
ful persuasion. Bryan wept with
emotion as Glynn pictured the vic
tories of peace, but he laughed with
the crowd when a Texas delegate in
terrupted Glynn, leaped to his chair
and cried. "And don't forget that pol
icy also is satisfactory to William
Jenings Bryan."
Then with studied emphasis, Gov.
Glynn said: "The fate of the fathers
of our country at the hands of a
jioisy minority is the fate of the pres
ident of the United States today. But
their reward of dignities merited and
lionors conferred will be his reward
when the people speak on the ides of
next November." .
The effect was electrical. The
speaker had not anticipated the out
break and raised his hand to stop
Avhat he thought was a passing bit
of applause. But the storm grew
louder. Far up in the gallery behind
the delegates a workingman sat. He
became a volunteer cheer leader.
From his lofty perch he directed the
demonstration. The galleries re
sponded, but the delegates took from
him his assumed leadership.
Covering every administration
from Washington to Harrison in
which negotiation had avoided war,
the Chairman argued that the Re
publicans must desert their leaders
and read them out of the party. Ev
ery nation, he added, has been sat
isfied of the Presidnt's firmness. It
may not, he said, satisfy the "fire
LONG IN THE LORD'S SERVICE
- - - A - NaBeS :..Jfi
Rev. Joseph Ballou.
That was an old-fashioned ser
vice at the Christian church Sunday
morning, but it was a very delight
ful and impressive one. The occasion
was the 49th anniversary of Elder
Joseph Ballou's ministry. The grand
old man was at his best and his
friends having gathered to hear a
good sermon, and at the same time
pay their respects to the beloved ser
vant of God, went away feeling
that like wine, "Bro." Ballou grows
better with years. The subject of the
sermon was "Preparedness," but his
text was from the 12th verse of the
fourth chapter of Amos "Prepare
to Meet Thy God, Oh Israel." The
speaker told of the necessity of be
ing prepared for the hereafter. Said
he: "Young men prepare to call on
their sweethearts and some women
make preparations to meet their
beaux, but it is a sad commentary on
mankind that there are those among
us who make no preparations to
meet their God." He admonished his
hearers to so live that when this life
is over and the real life is begun
there would be neither regrets nor
fears, neither sorrow nor pain. Rev.
Ballou told of his joining the church
soon after his marriage under the
ministry of Preacher Dunagan, and
how his good wife had grieved that
he had not -given hisheart to .God
sooner. Said he: "Going home from
church one day my wife seemed blue
and worried. I asked her what was
the matter. She answered by saying
between sobs that she was sorely dis
appointed; that she had set her heart
on my joining the church at that ser
vice and I had failed to do so. I com
forted her the best I could, but when
we went to meeting the following
day I took the step I have never re
greted. As Brother Dunagan sang
my favorite hymn I went foward and
made a confession, thank God." Lack
of space forbids a full report of the
good sermon, but suffice it to say
it was one of "Brother" Ballou's
very best, which means a great deal
to those who know what a good
preacher Rev. Ballou is.

with an entertainment which will
please everyone.
A Children's Chautauqua parade
has been arranged for one of the
opening boosting events for next
week, and will be held Saturday af
ternoon, beginning at 3 o'clock.
Masks and caps have been secured
and will be provided for all the lit
tle ones who will take part in the
parade. They are requested to meet
at the court house at three o'clock.
Cecil Williams, former Editor of
the Somerset Times, who passed
thru Stanford from Mt. Vernon to
Somerset Thursday, said that Somer
set had used the Alkahest Chautau
qua for two seasons and that the
people there were delighted with it,
and would have it again this season.
Rev. J. H. Pence, of Clayton, 111.,
who is here on a visit to his father,
Elisha Pence, near Rowland, saw the
program which will be given next
week and was loud in his praise of
Judge Alden, who lectures here. He
said: "Every man, woman and
child in this section should hear
Judge Alden. We had him at our
Chautauqua last year and he pleased
and delighted everybody. He is a
treat from beginning to end, and it
is worth the price of a season ticket
to hear him alone. Tell your people
not to miss Judge Alden, whatever
they do."
Similiar testimonials have been re
ceived by the promoters from others
who have seen various numbers which
will be given on the local program.
The Covington, Ga., had the fol
lowing to say about its Chautauqua:
"It is our opinion that the Alkahest-
Chautauqua in Covington has
helped our city more than anything'
we have had in years. A few reasons
why we believe this:
"First: That it was a success from
every standpoint.
"Second: That it brought people
to our city that would not have come
had it not been for the Chautauqua.
"Third: That we had brought to
our own doors first-class entertain
ments that larger cities seldom have
the pleasure of witnessing.
"Fourth: That it brought business
to Covington that would not have
come otherwise.
"Fifth: That we have had adver
tisement that is worth money to our
city.
"There wasn't a single attraction
given in our city without something
was said about the splendid audience
which attended. The attractions were
appreciated, and we have enjoyed
first-class entertainments for the en
tire week.
"There are usually three kinds of
people that go to make the average
small town the ones who say, 'It
can't be done' they are not worth
anything to a town. The ones who
say, 'it can be done but I would rath
er not do it' he is not worth much.
But the ones who say, 'IT CAN BE
DONE LET'S DO IT,' are the kind
that make a success at everything
they undertake. It is our opinion that
we have more of the 'LET'S DO IT
kind here than the average town, so
let's have another chautauqua for
next vear."

Should Sloan's Liniment Go Along?
Of course it should! For after a
strenuous day when your muscles
have been exercised to the limit an
application of Sloan's Liniment will
take the soreness and stiffness away
and get you in fine shape for the
morrow. You should also use it for a
sudden attack of toothache , stiff
neck, backache, stings, bites, and the
many accidents that are incidental to
a vacation. "We would as soon leave
our baggage as go on a vacatioi or
camp out without. Sloan's Liniment."
Writes one vacationist: "We use it
prepared and have no regrets.
