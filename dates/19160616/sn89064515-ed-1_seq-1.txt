FRIDAY, JUNE 16, 1916
FAIR BOARD HELD MEETING
DECIDED TO TRY AND GET RACE
TRACK—$1,800 FOR PREMIUMS
ON EXHIBITS
At a meeting of the fair board at
the office of the secretary Wednesday
afternoon it was decided to award
$1,800 in cash premiums at the county
fair in September. The matter of di
viding this amount between the vari
ous departments was left to the secre
tary and the heads of the departments.
The question of acquiring grounds
for a race track was discussed. The
officers were instructed to proceed to
seeure the necessary grounds if same
can be obtained at reasonable figures
and given full power to act in that
respect. It was understood that per
sons specially interested in horse rac
ing in the county shall do certain
things in connection with this matter
and upon a satisfactory showing by
them the Fair Society will do what is
necessary in this respect. Whether
the grounds will be in shape this fall
for track usage will depend upon the
success of these persona specially in
terested as to whether they can raise
the necessary funds. While it is too
late in the season for the arrangement
of a race program, yet, if the matter
is pushed vigorously the grounds might
be in shape for some race exhibition.
JIn view of the fact that the society
will be put to considerable expense
for additional grounds and also for
cash premiums it was decided to ap
point the financial committee at this
time, so that funds can be secured
early by subscriptions and the sale of
stock. It is hoped that a large num
ber of farmers will come in and buy
stock and help the society out in this
way, as well as by exhibits. The stock
is perfectly good as the society has ap
proximately three times as much as
sets as there is stock issued. The fol
lowing members were appointed as a
committee to secure funds: T. C. Gor
don, N. N. Bergheim, Charles Sylves
ter, George Kiewel, J. K. Martin, A.
F. Koslosky.
The board was informed by the sec
retary that the premium lists for some
departments were already being pre
pared. He asked for assistance on the
premiums covering livestock owing to
the fact that the results have not been
entirely satisfactory in the past. It
was the opinion of the board that there
should be a smaller number of classes
for livestock entries and that the pre
miums should be increased. An ef
fort should be made to offer premiums
on stock actually raised in the county
and breeders of full blood stock should
