WILSON AND MARSHALL ARE
NAMED BY ACCLAMATION
AT DEMOCRAT CONVENTION
President and Vice Presi
dent Again Chosen Party
Standard Bearers,
HOLD DEMONSTRATION
Following Naming of Lead
ers Huge Crowd Goes
Wild in Exultation.
St Louis. June 16. The democratic
national convention having by ac
clamation renominated President
Woodrow Wilson and Vice President
Thomas R. Marshall, meets in final
session today to adopt its declaration
of principles. The committee on reso
lutions was not ready to report when
the convention at midnight hail com
pleted the ticket, so aft.T listening to
a number of speeches a recess was
taken until 11 a. m.
ominale at Midnight.
It lacked but four minutes of mid
night when Senator Olli James of
Kentucky, permanent chairman of the
convention, announced that the ticket
which democracy will put before the
people had been completed. Unbound
ed enthusiasm marked the session
with a great demonstration lasting 45
minutes when John W. Westcott, attorney-general
of New Jersey, men
tioned the name of Woodrow Wilson.
It was 11:.':: p. m. when the president,
was declared the standard bearer for a
second time.
It took only four minutes to place
Vice President Marshall's name be
fore the convention and to nominate
him by acclamation. Senator John W.
Kern, who had prepared a long speech
nominating .Mr. Marshall, discarded it
and ill placing the Indiana man's
name, before the convention simply
said that in the name of the great
suite of Indiana he nominated Thomas
Riley Marshall for vivo president.
There was a wild cheer from the
Indiana delegates anil others and in
the din the rules were suspended and
Chairman James announced that the
vice president had been renominated
by acclamation.
"What is the pleasure of the conven
tion?" shouted Chairman Jan.es. when
it was learned the platform commit
tee was not ready to report, and back
came the answer, "Speech."
Lewis Talks.
Then for half an hour the crowd
listened to democratic doctrines ex
pounded by Senator Lewis of Illinois
and Representative Heflin of Alabama
and the ik-ccss followed. The gallery
was empty when the recess was taken
and the tired crowds that streamed out
of the dozen exits was composed most
ly of delegates and alternates.
The crowd came early last night to
hear the oratory and to see the dem
onstrations in the nomination. The
delegates, however, were slow in ar
riving and scores of tardy ones were
doomed to wait outside the big build
ing while the Wilson demonstration
was in progress. The crush within
the building was so great that the city
authorities ordered the doors closed.
William Jennings Bryan was the
first prominent democrat to run
against the order. The doorkeepers
hail si net orders and no amount of
argument could persaude them to let
the .N'ebraskan in the hall. Finally
word vas sent to Chairman James,
who ordered the doorkeeper to admit
the three times standard bearer of the
democratic party.

Second Spell
at New York
New York, June 16. Colonel Theo
dore Roosevelt suffered another se
vere coughing spell last night and this
morning was barely able to speak
above a whisper. His condition had so
little improved that his physician. Dr.
Hubert V. Guile, was called to the ho
tel where he is staying. Dr. Guile took
him to his office for an examination.
The colonel's appearance as he left
the hotel was haggard and he shook
his head negatively when asked if he
felt any better.
The colonel's illness came upon him
two days ago when one of his cough
ing spells caused the snapping of lig
aments of his ribs. He had planned to
return today to Oyster Bay but will
probably now remain longer under his
physician's care.
Colonel Roosevelt, when he heard
I that alarming reports were about
that he was dangerously ill, consented
to see newspaper men.
i "The trouble is really trivial," he
j said. "Simply a couple of tendons
snapped. I have a heavy cold in the
chest and whenever I cough it dis
tresses me. When I get rid of the cold
it will all disappear in a natural way."
The colonel was questioned as to the
political situation but reiterated that
he was "out of politics."
"I am a private citizen," he said,
"and wish to be treated as such. I do
not wish to be put in the position of
seeming to oacK down on wnat i nave
I said that I am out of politics."
ORPET'S DEFENSE
IS WE SECURE
Tolimony Itrouglit Out in Cross Ex

Uir of Aid to Youth.
Waukegan, 111., June 16. A factor
in the defense of Will Orpet, charged
with the murder of Marian Lambert,
was brought out today when cross ex
amination of Dr. Ralph W. Webster,
toxicologist, was resumed. Attorney
Ralph F. Potter of the defense ad
duced that nearly three months
elapsed from the finding of Marian's
body, Feb. 10 to May 5, when Marian's
coat and other garments were brought
to Dr. Webster, to have stains on them
analyzed. The coat introduced in evi
dence yesterday showed three circu
lar white spots, the marks, witness
said, of cyanide of potassium.
"Who brought the garments to
you?" asked Mr. Totter.
"Fred Wenban, the undertaker, and
Fred King."
"Had you talked previously with At
torney Joslyn of the prosecution, with
reference to any spots?"
"I can't say whether Mr. Joslyn was
present. State's Attorney Dady men
tioned them a day or so before the gar
ments were brought to me."
"And that was the first you heard of
the spots?"
"Yes, I believe it was, although I
have a hazy recollection that Wenban
may have mentioned them a few days
previously."
Wenban had testified that he ob
served the spots several hours after
Marian's body was brought to his
mortuary.

PRESIDENT WOODROW WILSOX
WILSON PLEASED
BY NOMINATIONS
President Thankful to Friends for Ke
n ami ii g Him and Vic President
Marshall at Convention.
Washington, June 16. President
Wilson arose early today to read ac
counts in the morning papers telling
of his renomination by the democratic
convention at St. Louis late last night.
He had been awakened from sleep an
hour after midnight by Secretary Tum
ulty and told over the telephone of the
convention's action in naming him and
Vice President Marshall by acclama
tion. "I am very grateful to my generous
friends," was his only comment.
The president retired only after re
ceiving over special White house tele
graph wires assurances that the Amer
icanism plank denouncing political ac
tivity of persons of foreign birth, would
be adopted without change from his
own draft.
He was pleased today that the threat
ened movement to soften terms of the
plank had died after he sent word last
evening insisting that the drastic dec
laration be allowed to stand.
GERMAN DRIVE IS
HELD BY FRENCH
Paris, Jnne 16. Powerful German
attacks made last night on the French
position southeast of Thiaumont farm
on the Verdun front broke down under
the French machine gun and infantry
fire, according to today's statement by
the war office.
The statement says the Germans
began their assault at 6 o'clock in the
evening on the right bank of the
Meuse from Hill 321 to the edge of
Hill 320. At the same time another
attack was launched at the southern
edge of the Caillette wood. All at
tacks were repulsed.
DENY REHEARING
IN MACOMB CASE
Springfield, 111., June 16. The su
preme court denied a rehearing today
in the Macomb anti-suffrage case. In
a recent decision the court held that
Dean Franklin and not Miss Josie
Westfall had been elected city judge
of Macomb, 111. Miss Westfall re
ceived the most votes, counting the
votes of women. Franklin received
the most male votes and the court
ruled that women could not vote legal
ly for city judges in Illinois.
Before she began to administer jus
tice in Macomb, Miss West-fall was ma
tron of an orphan asylum.
Medics Close Convention.
Detroit, June 16. Members of the
American Medical association closed
their annual convention here today by
participating in a public health parade
and later discussing methods of sani
tation at an open meeting at a dowu
Lowa Uieairo,
Democratic Convention
(Special to The Argus.)
St Louis, June 16. Roger C. Sulli
van, who was an avowed and earnest
candidate for the vice presidential
nomination when the democratic na
tional convention opened, made possi
ble the practically unanimous renom
ination of Vice President Thomas R.
Marshall, in accordance with the pres
ident's wishes, by gracefully eliminat
ing himself from the contest Sulli
van and his friends called a meeting of
the Illinois delegation, at which he
made a talk, explaining that if
Marshall was tho desired candidate,
his name would not be placed before
the convention. Some strife had arisen
in Illinois over Sullivan's candidacy,
due entirely to factional antagonism,
but Sullivan explained that even with
the solid support of his state back of
him, he would not allow his name to
precipitate a long drawn out contest
for second place on the ticket in the
face of the wishes of the president to
retain his former running mate. The
peculiarities of the Iowa and Missouri
primary election laws, however, left
Governor Major of ihe convention
state, who was endorsed for vice pres
ident in these two states, still in the
race, but he did not last long and
the democracy will go before the peo
ple with the winning combination of
four years ago.
Watch Newton Haker, secretary of
war in President Wilson's cabinet four
years from now, unless all signs fail.
A man of Wilson's type and choosing,
possessing all of Wilson's ideals, as
well as many of his scholarly attain
ments and abilities, when the president
was making up his original cabinet he
had Paker in mind for a portfolio, and
it is said such a place was offered him.
Baker wanted the position but he was
then mayor of Cleveland; he was in
augurating great reforms in munici
pal government and from a sense of
duty declined the great honor, a rare
one indeed, for one of his years, and
devoted himself to the fulfillment of
the trust reposed in him by the peo
ple of Cleveland. But the preident did
not dismiss him from his mind. He
admired the spirit of devotion and loy
alty manifested by the young Cleve
land mayor and when, after he had
completed his stewardship, and a lead
ing cabinet vacancy made possible the
renewal of the offer, it was made and
Baker went into the official family of
the head of the nation. That he is
one of the most trusted of the presi
dent's advisers, as well as one of those
nearest to the president, was shown in
the fact that he came here as Wilson's
special emissary, being charged with
bearing the ideas of his chief as to the
important planks in the democratic
national platform. Baker, who was a
protege of the late Mayor Tom L.
Johnson, whom he afterward succeed
ed in the mayor's chair, is a man of the
people, who is advancing rapidly in
the estimation of the people all over
the land.
Drawn here by the great convention
are leading and representative demo
crats from various sections of the
Fourteenth congressional district, and
while it is a little early yet to discuss
congressional politics, the feeling is
general that Congressman Clyde H.
Tavenner will have no opposition, at
least of a pronounced nature, for re
nomination. If anything, he is strong
er than he was two years ago. There

tion his sincerity in the course he pur
sues. Tavenner's chief asset, accord
ing to the democrats, consists of his
courage of conviction, his loyalty to
cause and principle, his devotion to
the laborer and farmer, and his fear
lessness in upholding at all times the
rights of industry, whether it be in the
factory or field.
"Clyde H. Tavenner looks good to
me," said a democrat, from Warren
county, "for as many years in congress
as he may desire to say there. We
have never had a more hard working
congressman nor one who could be
more thoroughly relied upon. We al
ways know where he stands, and he is
not afraid to fight for what he believes
to be right, and that no one in the dis
trict, no matter how humble, need ap
peal to him without receiving prompt
and courteous attention. He is the
ideal kind of a man to be congress
man." I
The sudden death in his apartments
at the Maryland hotel of Postmaster
William F. Kastings of Buffalo, cast
a gloom over the New York delega
tion, among whom he was much be
loved, as he was among the postmas
ter's of the country. Postmaster Kast
ings came here to attend a meeting of
the executive committee of the Na
tional Postmasters' association, and
his associate committeemen who met
with him the two preceding days were
waiting for him at the office of Post
master Selpf of St. Louis at 10 o'clock
yesterday morning, when the news
was telephoned that he had died. One
of the postmasters had left him in his
room but a half hour before when he
said he would be on hand in a few mo
ments, was so shocked that he broke
down and wept. The visiting post
masters summoned taxis and proceed
ed hastily to the hotel where Kastings
died and the department and the as
sistant postmaster at Buffalo were ap
prised of the death. Kastings had not
been well during his stay in St. Louis,
hut was particularly cheerful, and the
day before his death took some of his
associate postmasters to scenes in St.
Louis that were familiar to him when
he resided here a quarter of a cen
tury ago.
Kasting was one of the leading dem
ocrats of New York state and had been
prominently discussed for the party
nomination for governor of the Em
pire state.

The convention went wild with en
thusiasm for President Wilson during
the speeches of both the chairmen,
Glynn and James each having been in
terrupted for periods of 10 to 20 min
utes at a time while the great audi
ence cheered the mention of his
achievements on the part of President
Wilson. Throughout the proceedings
the convention was marked by enthus
iasm and cheerfulness and was full of
pep as well.
Bryan, who says he has got the con
vention habit and knows what he is
talking about, terms Temporary Chair
man Glynn's speech epoch making.
Senator James Hamilton Lewis, as
usual, was one of the most spectacu
lar as well as most admired of the
notables attending the convention.

Just before the convention opened

committee of the democratic conven

after 8 o'clock today and authorized.
Senator Stone, its chairman, to present
the document to the convention.
The committee began its final m

at work continuously until the draft
was completed. Few changes were
made in the tentative platform as
drawn by the sub-committee of nine
but the night was spent in discussion
of the phraseology of some of the more
important planks, especially those on
Americanism, woman suffrage and
Mexico.
Americanism., '.
St. 'Louis, June 16. The following
is the Americanism plank as reported,
by the resolutions sub-committee to
the full committee:
"The part that the United States
will play in the new day of interna
tional relationships which is now upon
us will depend upon our preparation
and our character. The democratic
party therefore recognized the asser
tion and triumphant demonstration of
the indivisibility and coherent strength,
of the nation, as the supreme is
sue of this day in which the world
faces the crisis of manifold change,
it summons all men, of whatever ori
gin or creed, who would count them
selves Americans, to join in making
clear to all the world the unity and
consequent power of America.
"This is an issue of patriotism. To
taint it with partisanship would be to
defile it In this day of test, America
must not show itself a nation of par
tisans but a nation of patriots. There
is gathered here in America the best
of the blood, the industry and the
genius of the whole world, the ele
ments of a great race, a splendid na
tion. "Whoever, actuated by the purpose
to promote the interest of a foreign,
power, in disregard of our own coun
try's welfare, or to injure this gov
ernment in its foreign relations, or
cripple or destroy its industries at
home, and whoever, by arousing preju
dices of a racial, religious or other
nature, creates discord and strife
among our people so as to obstruct
the wholesome process of unification,
is faithless to the trust which the
privileges of citizenship repose in him
and to his country.
"We, therefore, condemn as sub
versive to this nation's unity and in
tegrity, and as destructive of its wel
fare, the activities and designs of
every group or organization, political
or otherwise, that has for its object
the advancement of the interest of a
foreign power, whether such object is
promoted by intimidating the govern
ment, a political party, or representa
tives of the people, or which is calcu
lated and tends to divide our people
i into antagonistic groups and thus to
destroy that complete agreement anl
solidarity of the people and that unity
of sentiment and national purpose so
essential to the perpetuity of the na
tion and its free institutions.
"We condemn all alliances and com
binations of individuals in this coun
try of whatever nationality or descent,
who agree and conspire together for
tho purpose of embarrassing or weak
ening our government or of improp
erly influencing or coercing our pub
lic representatives in dealing or nego
tiating with any foreign power. We
cnarge that such conspiracies among
a limited number exist and have been
instigated for the purpose of advanc
ing the interests of foreign countries
to the prejudice and detriment of our
own country. We condemn any politi
cal party which, in view of the activ
ity of such conspirators, surrenders
its integrity or modifies its policy."
