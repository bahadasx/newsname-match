THE PBOGRESS OF THE WAR
The eyes of the world jubt now are on
the Russians in their drive to the west.
Three times the Teutons have overrun a
large part of Gallicia and other Bussiaii
provinces and twice the Russians have
driven them back again and now for the
third time the Russians are on the of
fensive and have pushed tne Teutons
backwards for a very considerable dis
tance and are still advancing. The
whole battle line is about 500 miles long
and the advance has been in the central
and southern parts. Russians claim to
have taken over 100,000 prisoners in their
operations during the last month.
A naval battle in whieh the Russians
eunk a warship and several merchant
vessels which were being convoyed is re
ported. ,It is also rumored that theft is
a large British naval force now in the
Baltic.
Heavy fighting continues at Verdun,
the Germans making some important
gains in territory but with a consider*
able loss of men. Undoubtedly some
eight or ten square miles northward
from Verdun contains more human
blood than any other similar area has
ever contained.
The British and particularly the Can
adians have been fighting hard a great
deal of the time for the last fortnight
and casualty lists as printed show large
losses. The Germans drove them back
wards near Ypres on June 2nd, but -the
British have taken most of the lost area
back again.
Affairs in Mexico are no better. 8ome
1,500 more regulars were ordered to the
border last week.
THE DANDYLION.
Why the "dandy1*? Why the "lions"?
Why the **dandy lion"?
It is a "dandy" in drees. There is no
flower more brilliant and guady. Even
the atoms of the flowers are something
of the unique compared with the sop*
ports of other blossoms. A luxuriant
green lawn or field through which these
golden tops are scattered givse a

because it is "the king of vegetation" or
from the tawny name of its namesake
we are not sure. Like the king of
beasts it also lies low and springs on Hs
prey. Its flat leaves 'fight by lying on
and iover the surrounding grasses and
thus smother them to-save its own exist*
ence.
Asa .whole from, its own deep rooted
standpoint the dandylion is a decided
siiecess. ilt is the living expression of
Mrootibog
or die" and usually the hog
lives, ilt itights both item.the trench and
with litsaeroplanes.
Ebeuitrom the standpoint of its enem
ies it iieatsome value. -A«dish of "greeni"
make.aifine addition to anyone's meal,
while it makes a dandy «tine (even -in
prohibition North Dakota) and its roots
are valuable as medicine and it is said
that iuat now the drug men are looking
for supplies from this country which in
former and .more peaceful years they got
from Germany. Think what fortunes
await the North Dakota farmer and
householder If the demand only keeps
up. The average North Dakota dandy
lion is a biped—*t has two feet to eaoh
root.
But nobody
t(but
children loves the
dandylion. It is friendless. Men,women
and other vegetation hate, despise and
fight it. With all its beauty, with all its
energy and iniative, we despise the one
and combat the other.
Why? Young man, young woman and
other old people take notice and medi
ate. It is just a ease of being too fresh.
Too much and too often a "butt-in".
Beauty, good looks, energy., ability are
all good things to have—but there can
be too much of any good thing—if it
•intei feres with the good things of others.
Don't be too fresh.
DRAIN NO. 16.
The complete report of the financial
statutes of Drain No. 16 situated in Car
lisle and Hamilton townships given us
by Auditor Felson will not only be of
value to those who were taxed for that
drain but to others who have such drainB
in prospect.
We are not intending to criticise the
cost of construction of this particular
drain, but the fact remains as shown
not only in his drain but in all others in
whioh the figures have been given to the
public, that the actual wotk of the ex
cavation is generally proportionately
small compared with other items of ex
pense.
The average public drain'to construct
ed in this level country is but little
larger, and often, no larger, than the
average highway ditch. Graded high
ways are built with drains on two sides
for from 9150 to 1200 per mile. Com
pare this cost with the cost for the
county drain.
We need drainage. We need compre
hensive and connected drain systems.
But the farmers better build their own
ditches by private communities and thus
save a lot of money.
FOR PRESIDENT,
CHARLES E. HUGHES.
While the name of Mr. Hughes bad
been prominent before the assembling
of the Chicago convention, and though
he was the most popular candidate, yet
until he was notified of that nomination
he had not uttered a word as to his per
sonal standing on current and important
issues.
In this respect his praotically unani
mous ohoice by the delegates was per
haps one of tbe most unique things in
our political history. The nomination
was made solely on acoouotof his known
oharacter and ability, and not because
of any expressed personal ideas. This
in itself means very much, and perhaps
tbe greatest possible compliment.
But in bis brief answer to the notifica
tion of the chairman of tbe convention
loyal eitisea
of
'•n ma
Wbethsr nam'sd thus no matter what his political affiliation.
the United States,
When tbe Democrat? took the Tariff
off of leather to.make the shoe and har
ness cheaper, they did a great thing for
the country, for the fact is demonstrated
in the continued inorease of the price of
ehoes and harness. That is where the
proof gets into the pudding. And now
•comes the manufacturers with the state
ment that another advance in shoes
•must be expected. Xieither of all kindsi,
they, say has gone -iyt. Shoes must go
HP, too. As a matter of course, they,
can't stay down when the Democrats
give UB free hides and take the Tariff
off of all kinds of leather.
Great are the blessings Free-Trade,
and great is the party that inaugurates
such blessings. Truly the Wilson ad
ministration ought to be canonized for
the benefit it has bestowed on the peo
pie. Belah.—Portland «(Ind.) Commer
cial Review.

it la something for self oongratolatiojii to
•know that If thaother candidate is to%#
elected that be ia a good Atneriean efti*
sen, with all that name implies.
Mr. Wilson will bo selected by ib*
coming Demoovatie convention this week.
Mr. Roosevelt was nominated by the
Progressive .party but baa slated that if
Mr. Hughes'tviews suit him that heooay
notaocept.
If Roosevelt declines to run we believe
that Republioaa suocess is assured, and
by no means a lost cause if Roosevelt
runs. Conditions in all parties are very
different than they were four years ago
and party lines will be drawn in wery
different directions. The effects and
phases of tbe European war have pretty:
weil broken former party lines and
-issues, and (the platforms of allthree
parties will .read very much alike thii
year. The personality of the candidates
and their records will be the controlling
motives in casting ballots this year.
It is yet four months to election and
history is being made rapidly these days.
New questione and new issues are likely
to arise that may make present, propb
icies null and void because of the differ
ent oonditiona, but as things are, taking
all things into consideration it looks like
Hughes after the next fourth of March."
