rThe plank demanding- government for, Hawaii by officials "qualified
by previous bona fide'residence,' - is probably the result of the efforts of
the anti-Pinkham "delegation from Hawaii. ' ; ; y
Some weeks before the delegation left for St. Louis the Star-Bulletin
printed the plans of the anti-governdr faction to get into the platform
a plank which wouh be a slap at Governor Pinkham. The McCandless
faction asserts that the governor was not a bona-fide resident of the
territory at the time he was appointed to office. . While Alaska and
Porto Rico areko .mentioned, the plank bears such close fesemblance
to that mapped out in advance by L. L.'McCandless,.M. C Pacheco and
others of the delegation that its appearance in the platform is probably
due to their activities. -d. ; v. ":' -y- y y -;. .. v r J
