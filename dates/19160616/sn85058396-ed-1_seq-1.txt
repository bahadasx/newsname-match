Long before 9 o'clock, the hour for
convening, the big Coliseum galleries
and other reserved seats were filled
The delegates, however, were slow in
arriving and scores of tardy ones were
doomed to wait outside the big build
ing while the Wilson demonstration
was on progress. The crush within
the building was so great that the
city authorities ordered the doors
closed.
Demands For Bryan.
When Chairman James rapped for
order at 9:15 there were instant and
insistent demands for Bryan Sen
ator James had anticipated the calls
and immediately recognized Senator

be suspended and that Mr. Bryan be
invited to address the delegates. There
was a preponderance of "yeas" and
Mr. Bryan was escorted to the plat
form Spotlights from the gallery were
thrown on Mr. Bryan as he stood on
the speaker's stand, waiting for the
cheering to subside. In his hand lie
carried a palm leaf fan which he wield
ed vigorously. On his coat was pinn
ed a press badge. Mr. Bryan's speech
wns.A. J-evic.wnf, the achievements of,
the Democratic party since Woodrolv
Wilson took office. He was unstint
ed in his praise of the president and
was greeted with repeated storms of
cheers as ho recited the good things
done by the Democratic party. Mr.
Bryan warmed to his subject when he
spoke on peace.
"The president will not lack those
who will defend his conduct in keep
ing the coutnry out of kar," he de
clared. There was great cheering
when he lifted his arms and solemnly
said that "In every home you will find
a mother who will thank the president
that her boy has not neen sent to
Mexico to die In tho trenches."
Mr. Bryan said that if be understood
the nation's opportunity, it is to lead
the world away from its false phil
osophy and help It to build its hopes
of peace on the enduring foundation
of lovo and brotherhood and co-operation.
"I am a lover c my country, I
want my country to win this greatest
of all prizes," he said "As a Demo
crat. I want mv party to have the hon
or that shall "come with the accomp
lishment of such a task, and I stand
with the Democrats of the nation to
frivo Wnnrirrm- Wilson an onnortunity
to be that man."

Wilson's activities in the interest of
peace, won Mr. Bryan a most enthusi
astic demonstration when he conclud
ed and returned to his seat In the
press section.
Westcott Makes Nominating Speech.
The crowd having been satisfied
with hearing Mr Bryan, settled back
for the nominations. Alabama yielded
to New Jersey when the roll was
called for the presidential nominations
and as Judge Westcott, who made the
nominating speech for Mr. Wilson at
Baltimore, four years ago, started for
the platform, an enthusiastic Jersey
man slapped him on the back and
said: "Good luck to you, Judge."
Judge Westcott spoke slowly and
his voice was heard in every part of
the hall. There were few interrup
tions until near the close when cries
went up from different parts of the
hall: "Name your man." When he
did name his man there was tremend
ous cheering and the hall Instantly be
came one huge kaleidoscope. Pictures
of Wood row Wilson burst forth In all
parts yof the vast auditorium.
