..AJUBkogeo County District Court wts
culled -horo Monday, morning whon
Cprley P. Mcparment, tho youthful
school teacher from the Waggoner
IUgh School, formerly n Durnnt boy,
faced trial for tho murder of Edgar
Watts, ono of his pupils, Tho star
witness for the prosecution was
Clark "Moss, another pupil, who .was
In the basotuont whero tho killing oc
curred, and who wan hlmBelf wound
ed. Moss's testimony seonm to fav
or the defendant In every particular,
andthe testimony of tho janitor and
Hugh Mother, still another pupil who
claims to have overheard tho Moas
and Watts boy plotting, seem also to
substantiate McDarmcnt's story.
Evidcuse so far taken seems to
show that both the Watts and Moso
boys had been tho bad boys of the
school for several years and that no
teachers had been ablo to cope with
them.
Not as much difficulty as was an
ticipated was found In getting a jury
and tho trial of tho case proper start
ed Tuesday. The State Is represent
ed by County Attorney Fred Bran
son of Muskogee and some outside
counsel employed by tho rather or
the slain boy, while tho defense Is
represented by Attorneys Moman
Prultt and J. Q. A. Hnrrod of Okla
homa City.
McDormcnt on tho stand told a
clear Btory of the whole business, and
sticks to his original 'story In spite
of offorts to tangle him up on the do
tails. The court room has been crowded
tp capacity every session.

Democratic National Convention In.
tho history of tho party opened in St.
Louis Wednesday, when It was soon
found thai every dclecuta 'nmanni-
favored the re-nomina(lon of Presi
dent WHson as the Party's leader in
tho fall campaign. Chief Interest,
thon, naturally settled around tho sn-
loctlon or tho resolutions committee,
and much good feeling resulted from
Mr. Bryan's assertion that he had no
plank to offor and would support tho
platform. Mr. Bryan was there as a
press representative, and had even
declined a proxy as delegate from
Nebraska, for which Jionor ho was1
defeated In tho Nebraska Stato con
vention. The keynoto speech was made by
Governor Glynn of New York, as a
result of which delegates became so
demonstrative of their ' appreciation
that tho police word compelled to re
store oj-der. Mr. Olynh spoke In fav
or of peace with honor.' but not neneo
at any price. Ho says that this poli
cy' will not pleaso tho fire-eater and
tho swash-buckler, but it will pleaso
tho mothers of his land. Sixteen
minutes of applause followed tho re
mark. An Americanism plank, drawn
partly by the president nnd partly by
others, will go. into tho plntrorm. In
It the foreIgn-orn Americans aro se
verely criticised for interfering in be
half of the foreign nations in the de
lations between the United States
and other countries.' "Tho plank de
nounces men who seek to Interfere
with American Institutions bv oollti-
car organizations under foreign in-
uuqee,.-
,It Is-Jikely that a suffrage nlank
WUlnfreap into the platform, and
'Unit another. plantf for tho submis
sion of ;tho national prohibition pro
hibition question to tho voter will al-
ho find a berth.
