Continue for Ten Weeks.
East Jordan is to have supervised
swimming and playgrounds during the
'oming summer. This has been made
possible through the interest of a num
ber of business and professional men of
the city, with the cooperation of the
city commission and board of education.
This work is to begin Monday, June
19, and will continue through ten
weeks. The playground will be located
at the Central School Grounds, and
will be open to children of all ages.
Miss Grace Malpass and Mr. Bruce
Cross have been engaged to take
charge of the work, and will supervise
the swimming as well. The location
chosen for the bathing beach is near
the old Pine dock on the west side of
the lake, where a dressing room will
be provided with safety ropes for the
smaller children.
The schedule of the work may be
varied if the conditions demand it, but
at the beginning will be as follows:
v 8:00-1 Daily Playground Games.
) 1:00-2:00 Daily Story Hour.
.S 2:03-5:30 Except Saturday Play
ground Games.
3:00-4:00 Daily Swimming and Bath

The playgrounds will of course be
closed on Sunday, and the dressing
room at the bathing beach will be
closed.
All children may come at all times,
subject to the discipline of the play
grounds, and no charge will be made
to anyone: Mr. B. J. llolcomb, who
is supervising school gardens through
the summer, has been appointed to
take charge of directing the work.

EAST JORDAN COUPLE
MARKIED AT FLINT
Miss Mary E. DeWitt, daughter of
Mr. and Mrs. Herman DeWitt of this
citv and Harrv W. Valleau, whose
father resides in this city, were united
in marriage at Flint last Saturday eve
nine. June 10th. The ceremony took
place at the Congregational parsonage,
and the happy couple went from there
to their new home at 933 Garland St.
Both Mr. and Mrs. Valleau are well-
known and popular East Jordan young
people. They graduated from our
public schools and then taking up dif
ferent vacations, the bride having
charge of the Jordan River School for
a few years, and the groom going to
Flint where he entered the employ of
one of the auto works of that city.
Their many friends here extended
sincere congratulations.
PICTURED IN PANAMA
"The Ne'er-Do-Well," filmed as a
spectacular drama by the Selig Poly
scope Company is considered by many
as Rex Beach's greatest story.
In "The Ne'er-Do-Well," fascinating
Panama scenery is shown, including
the work of digging the Panama Canah
the interiors of old Spanish homes,
glimpses of the interior of the tropical
jungle, and odd and interesting nooks
and corners.
The cast in "The Ne'er-Do-Well" in
cludes Kathlyn Williams, Eugenie Bes
serer, Wheeler Oakman, Frank Clark
and others. Almost the same cast of
stars that added to the realism of "The
Spoilers," Beach's other great story,
filmed by the Selig Company, appear in
"The Ne'er-Do-Well."
Charming Kathlyn Williams enacts
the strongest character role in her
career as Mrs. Stephen Cortlandt, the
woman diplomat. The role of Kirk
Anthony, the "ne'er-do-well," is en
acted by Wheeler Oakman.
This wonderful Selig production will
play at the Temple Theatre for two
nights, Thursday and Friday, June 29
and 30.
Having overthrown the Civil Service
law at every opportunity, and having
filled the offices with as many Demo
crats as possible, it is to be expected
that the Wilson administration will
soon reverse its attitude and become
an advocate of the principle of Civil
Service Reform. An order may be
expected almost any time throwing a
protecting cloak around all those "de
serving Democrats" who have been
placed on the government pay roll.
Dry Campaign
Starts Sunday
Union Meeting, Temple Theatre,
In the Evening.
Anti-Saloon League Field Day is
next Sunday, June 18th. In the morn
ing the Rev. W. V. Waltman of Grand
Rapids will speak in the M. E. church,
and the Rev. Matt Mullen of Traverse
City will speak in the Presbyterian
church. In the afternoon, these speak
ers will both hold services in some of
the near by school houses. At 7:30 p.
m. a Union meeting will be held in the
Temple Theatre. Both Mr. Waltman
and Mr. Mullen will speak. A union
choir will lead the singing. Mr. Mullen
is the District Superintendent of the
League and is known as a most force
ful speaker. Mr. Waltman is a new
worker in this part of the state. Both
of these men will be here in the
interest of state-wide prohibition,
which is to be one of the issues in the
campaign this fall. Everyone is
interested in this question, and every
one is invited to attend these meetings.
ALONG THE FIRING LINE
Again the Democratic campaigners
have crossed their wires. Some of
them have been asserting for several
weeks that it was the Federal Reserve
Banking law that restored prosperity.
But Secretary of the Treasury McAdoo
spoiled that argument by showing that
the Federal Reserve system did not get
into operation until after the upward
turn in our industrial affairs. Now
comes Paul M. Warburg, of the Federal
Reserve Board, with the declaration
that the turn came early in 1914, and
that the "advent of the war precipitated
this development with unprecedented
rapidity and to an unprecedented de
gree." The statistics of the Depart
ment of Commerce show that the up
ward turn did not come until Septem
ber, 1914, one month after the outbreak
of the war. Therefore, by the process
of elimination, we arrive at the con
clusion that recovery from the hard
times brought on by Democratic tariff
legislation did not begin until after the
war broke out, that it was the war that
brought development with unprecedent
ed rapidity and to an unprecedented
degree, and that the Federal Reserve
Law had nothing to do with it. The
Republicans are certainly grateful to
the administration campaigners for
letting a little of the real truth leak out'
Consul General R. P. Skinner of Lon
don reports that the total value of de
clared exports from London to the
United States during the first four
months of 191G was $58,822,349, as
against $45,008,931 for the first four
months of 1915. Wonder what they
would have done to us had they been
at peace and we with a free trade
Democratic tariff law on our hands?
It costs about 10 cents a pound to
produce copper. The normal price is
about 12 cents, so that there is, ordinari
ly, a profit of about 2 cents per pound.
Of course the cost varies, and changes
the margin of profit, but this is a gen
eral average. Now copper brings from
27 to 30 cents per pound. Probably the
cost of production has advanced 20 per
cent, so that the average cost now is
about 12 cents, leaving a profit of about
14 cents per pound. With profits 700
per cent greater than before the war,
no wonder that there is great activity
in the copper industry and great pros
perity in communities producing this
essential of modern warfare.
There is great doubt whether Ameri
can manufacturers will be permitted to
import from Germany the dyestuffs so
necssary to the continued operation of
their factories in all branches. Yet the
Democratic Congress refused to enact
the protective legislation that must be
had before American investors will
establish dye plants. We continue, de
pendent upon some other country be
cause President Wilson and his party
believe that the protection idea is "an
economic error." In the opinion of
the schoolmaster, it is economic error
for us to have dye plants of our own
when we can buy cheaper somewhere
else. But, fortunately, the opinion of
the American business man is to pre
vail in the 1916 election, and we shall
have a real "America First" policy
adopted, after which we shall have
dyes "made in America," by American
labor, financed by American capital.
State Taxes
Are Doubled
Time For People To Sit Up And
Take Notice
The people are beginning to realize
what special sessions of the legislature,
fad laws and burdensome boards are
costing the taxpayers of Michigan. The
increase in population, general de
mands and public improvements have
not justified the enormous advance in
taxation. .
The Michigan State Association has
just issued a bulletin which presents
some startling figures in regard to the
gradual rise, of taxation within the past
ten years. According to this bulletin,
the tax levy of 1915 showed an increase
of 130 per cent, over the levy of 190G.
The justificable difference would not
exceed 50 per cent and a great portion
of what would have been assigned to a
few profit-taking rcorporations under
equitable conditions.
Within the next few years the peo
ple will be called upon to stand a por
tion of the increased taxation for
national preparedness (a laudable and
necessary movement) and therefore it
would be well to carefully scrutinize
state expenditures and pare them down
wherever possible. Michigan to-day is
getting little in return for its vast
public expenditures. This is due
largely to the fact that the people pay
little attention to the new laws which
create high-salaried boards and commis
sions. In the past the proposition has
been to frame up something new at
each session of the legislature to care
for all the deserving henchmen and
ward heelers. Every man who has
proven himself to be incompetent in
professional, mercantile and trade lines
has had an opportunity to go on the
state's pay roll, and the people have
paid the price. What have we had for
the money?
The bulletin issued by the State Tax
Association says:
"The statistical tables, in this bulletin
have been published in order that the
people of the state might have before
them the concrete facts relating to tax
levies and government costs.
"Taxes have increased by leaps and
bounds in recent years, until today the
people are groaning under the heavy
burden. The demand is general
throughout the state that something be
done to check the constantly increasing
drain upon the public purse.
The Michigan State Tax Association
cannot at this time definitely point out
the cause or causes of the seemingly
extraordinary increase in public ex
penditures during the last decade,
neither has it any suggestions to offer
other than to urge upon our public
servants the necessity of strict econo
my. The association will be in a position
to draw definite conclusions as the rea
son for the present heavy tax burden
after it has completed its investigation
of public expenditures."
The tax levy figures presented in
the bulletin follow:

DO YOU KNOW THAT
Rural sanitation is a health protection
to the city-dweller?
It's foolish to educate a boy and then
let him die of typhoid fever?
The U. S. Public Health Service
issues a free bulletin on the summer
care of infants?
Exercise in the garden is better than
exercise in the gymnasium?
Cleart water, clean food, clean houses
make clean healthy American citizens?
The State of California has reduced
its typhoid death rate 70 per cent in
the past ten years?
Rats are the most expensive animals
which man maintains?
It is estimated that the average
manure pile will breed 900,000 flies per
ton? '
Our idea of true faith is that of a man
who advertises for the return of a lost
umbrella.
PLANTING BEANS
IS PROFITABLE
There are many reasons why every
farmer in Michigan should include
Beans in his program of. plantage this
year and one reason that stands out far
and above all others. Every bushel
that is raised will bring more than $3.00
in cash. Even though a total of 10,000
000 bushels were produced in the state
during the summer the market would
absorb them at that price. It will be
absolutely impossible for a grower to
lose under such conditions.
Behind this situation there is a rea
son. Until two years ago the United States
was importing between 1,000,000 and
3,000,000 bushels of Beans annually
from Europe. Now the process has
been reversed. During 1915, 3,000,000
bushels were exported. Millions upon
millions of cans went to England.
France, Greece and other countries
and until the present war is over this
exportation will increase. This means
a demand, a real demand, and, coupled
with the known facts that the annual
consumption in the United States alone
is 10,000,000 bushels, it means that the
market never before offered such
wonderful advantages to the growers.
The Michigan little pea Bean is the
pride of the nation. It is the best and
it is the easiest of cultivation. It means
quick results. The crop is planted up
to the fifteenth of June and is harvest
ed by October 1st. Any rich, well
drained sod land will grow good beans
and good Beans may be grown on sand
loam, clay or much-mixed clay soil.
Thorough preparation is essential, with
plenty of dragging and rolling, and
uniform seed should be used. Then
with fair cultivating care the rest is
simple and the profit at the finish will
be large.
Last year Michigan produced about
3,500,000 bushels of Beans. This year
the acreage has been increased so that
10,000,000 bushels will be produced.
This means at least $30,000,000 if not
more. No single crop could show
greater results and farmers realize it.
The progressive man in the country
knows that, even though he has no
munition factory, he" may profit by the
war. All that he has to do is to put in
a crop of Beans. The profit is auto
matic. Samson went at a rapid pace after he
got that gate on him.
One way to earn a living is by honest
labor, but some men never think of
trying it. '
And some men are even conceited
enough to think that they understand a
woman.
Don't get too self-important; the
world will go on just the same after
you get out.

Beautiful Movie-star who will be seen at the Temple Theatre on
Thursday and Friday, June 29th and 30th, in the Selig's ten-part screen
version of "THE NE'ER-DO-WELL," one of the strongest pictures the
screen has ever witnessed,
NEW STYLES FOR
DIME. QUARTER
AND HALF DOLLAR
New kinds of of dimes, quarters and
half dollars will be minted after July 1,
for the first time since 1891.
The" half dollar has fallen practically
into disuse and a new design was
selected in the hope of restoring it to
more general circulation.
The half dollar and dime models were
made by Adolph A. Weinman, and the
quarter dollar by Herman A. MacNeil,
sculptors of note.
The face of the new half dollar bears
the full length of Liberty, with a back
ground of the American flag flying to
the breeze. The Goddess is striding
toward the dawn of a new day, carry
ing laurel and oak branches, symbolic
of civil and military glory. The reverse
side shows an eagle perched high up
on a mountain crag, wings unfolded.
Growing from a rift in the rock is a
sapling of mountain pine, symbolic of
America.
"The design of the twenty-five cent
piece is intended to typify the awak
ening of the country to its own pro
tection, Secretary McAdoo's announce
ment stated.
Liberty, a full length figure, is shown
stepping toward the country's gate
way, bearing upraised a shield, from
which the covering is being drawn.
The right hand bears an olive branch
or peace. Above the head is the word
"Liberty" and below the feet "1916."
The reverse side bears the figure of an
eagle in full flight, wings extended,
and the inscriptions "United States of
America" and "E Pluribus Unum."
Both the half and the quarter bear
the phrase "In God We Trust."
The design of the dime is simple.
Liberty with a winged cap is shown on
the fore side and on the reverse is a
design of a bundle of rods and a battle
axe, symbolical of unity, "wherein lies
the nation's strength."
David R. Jones, of the state game
and fish department, and William
Pearson, of the state forestry depart
ment, have been in the northern part
of the state for two weeks looking after
the forest fire service and organizing
the force for the summer. They have
selected four of the highest points
on the nothern half of the state
on which to erect fire signal towers
and in other ways prepared for trou
ble Towers will be erected at once
and the service placed in full operation.
Since the recent hard rains there have
been no fires in the woods, but a few
days of real warm weather and with
warm winds would place the timber
sections in good condition again for
bad fires.
