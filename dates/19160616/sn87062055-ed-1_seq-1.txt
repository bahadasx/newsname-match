BIG FOREST FIRE BACK
OF ELDEN MI. WEDNESDAY
A forest fire started by one of tho
Greenlaw loging engines burned over
40 acres before checked by men from
tho mill company and the forest offi
cers. Three fires were started at tho
snme time but Motor Patrolman Bn-
hcld'de11 was aWc. to extinguish two of
them before they gained neauway.
The third fire got beyond his control
while he was working on the others
ahd a general alarm was sent out.
The mill company rushed 15 men
to the fire, some from the Cliffs and
some from the logging camp, while
the forest office here send out 5 men.
Mr. T. A. Riordan, of the A. L. & T.,
was also at the scone of the fire.
This was the second largest sNfire
this year, the largest burning over
160 acres near Sedona. There is a
keen competition between the various
forests in the southwest in keeping
.the fires down to a minimum. A re
ward is issued from the district office
at Albuquerque every year in the
; form of a framed letter to the forest
having the best record.
In judging the contest for the year
the fires arc divided into three class-
KS

WILLIS AND HENRY AZBILL
Defendants in Sensational
Jury Returned Verdict
the Penalty
Willis and Henry Azbill were "con
victed of first degree murder and
sentenced to death Monday night at
the close of a trial of eleven days
duration. The jury was out just
fifteen minutes and it is said that only
two-ballots were taken, one to convict
n-,l nn fnr th KPntnnpP.
The rest in the defense came as a
surprise last Friday afternoon as it
was known that they had several wit-
nesses that had never been placed on
the stand.
'In the arguments to the jury the
defense tried to establish an alibi, the
whole of their .defense hinging qn the
failure of the state to establish the
identity of the body found in the J.
D. Tank, the claim for no motive and
absence of the Azbills in the vicinity
of the tank when on their prospecting
trip.
In presenting the state's ease to
the jury County Attorney 9. B. Wil
son successfully combatted the sup
posed alibi by showing that in making
the trip there were from 3 to 5 days
unaccounted for, allowing ample time
for a visit to the tank and return.
The lapse of these few days in time
occurred between Prcscott and Wil
liamson Valley on the road to King-

fact that as Willis Azbill did not take '

Steps are being taken for the
organization of a gun club for

BIG WATER TANKS ARE
NUMEROUS IN COCONINO
Each year the 'stockmen of
Coconino County arc investing
' large sums of money in the
building of tanks and the loca-
tion of water holes, the great
problem being a location that
will "catch and hold." Although
! many of their efforts ore un-1
successful, the risk, taken is con-
sidered well worth while.
One of the biggest tanks in the
country will be completed about
the first of July. It belongs to
A. J. LcBarron and is located
onrhis ranch about 0 miles from
Angel. The tank is 450 by 100

TOWN GHARTER IS NOT
NEEDED TO INCORPORATE
x
The, question' of the missing town
charter, brought up in the meeting of
the Board of Trade last Wednesday
evening, has been without a .doubt
settled by digging into the minutes o"f
the board of supervisors in their
meeting of May 26, 1894, and was
presented to the Board of Trade at a
special meeting Monday by O. H.
John.
Upon petition of two-thirds of the
tax payers of Flagstaff the board in
corporated Flagstaff as the town of
Flagstaff in accordance with act No.
72 of 'the Legislative Assembly of
1893. They appointed the following
men to act as council until their suc
cessors were duly elected: Gorham
Jr. . T)-i- T T7nnH Tn.-.o A
.'. J . . '
Vail, John T. Daggs, David Babbitt
The board of supervisors at that time
consisted of A. A. Dutton, chairman,
F. F. McMillon, member and C. A.
Bush, clerk.
The committee on the tent city for
Flagstaff was continued, owing to
their inability to report anything de
finite in the way of a site, etc.
The report of the committee on a
drinking fountain, for tho depot re
ported favorably, stating that the
fountain would cost from $50 to $100.
It was decided to erect a fountain
using a- granite boulder and place a
bronze plate on tho fountain with a
(1 suitable legend advertising the best
water in the west Suggestions for
inscriptions will be received by Sec
retary W. E. Berg from any person
interested.
A fountain erection committee con
sisting of Ed.' Whipple,L.-B. Lanahan
and J. D. Morton was appointed. W.
L. Taylor, Ed. Whipple, and R. A.
Morse were appointed as a fountain
fund committee." Anyone desiring to
contribute toward the fountain may
leave their money with any member
of the committee.
A communication from the chaplin
of the 1st Arizona Infantry at Doug
las was read, in which he asked for
donations for an entertainment hall
and reading room for the soldier boys
on the border. Cash or reading matter
will be received by the following com
mittee appointed by the board to
handle the matter: R. C. Babbitt, A.
W. Bikker, W. L. Taylor.
The report of thfe committee on a
Coconino County Chamber of Com-
mcrce was laid on the table until the
(next meeting. Judging by the dis-
' cussion it created the proposition will

Believed to Have Cut the Wrong Man
In a cutting fray, which occurred on
Railroad avenue about 2 o'clock Mon:
day morning, Ramon Garcia received
a stab in the side which mav nrove
fatal. The cut was about four inches
long and entered 'the lung.
Garcia was going home when he
encountered three other Mexicans
whom he feared were" coin to treat
himx roughly. He turned and ran into
one of the Chinese restaurants on
Railroad avenue and called out a
friend to help him. When he turned
around one of his pursuers plunged
a knife into his side.
Immediately after the stabbing the
three Mexicans disappeared and as
yet no trace of them has been found.
ILL IRE PLEISED WITH
NOMINATION OF HUGHES
Republicans all over the country
are jubilant over the nomination of
Chief Justice Hughes as the Republi-
can candidate for President The Through the efforts of L. B. Lana

Progressive ticket was expected and j a local union of the Bricklayers, Ma-
I .1 i- .'-f il . .Uav.

was over. , s
The, domination of Mr. Hughes
came about without serious opposi
tion from any of the proposed candi
dates and without a statement from,
him regarding the acceptance of the
honor or a solicitation for the office.
His attitude was "If the people want
me or a candidate, Tarn duty bound
to step from the bench and lead the
party in the coming campaign."
Speaking in regard to his stand in
the coming campaign he says: "My
attitude is one of undiluted Amer
icanism, and anybody that supports
me is supporting an out-and-out-American
policy, absolutely nothing
else."
Mr. Fairbanks will be his running
mate.
WILSON ANO MARSHALL
. .NOMINATED UST NIGHT
Woodrow Wilson was nominated by
the Democratic convention in St
Louis last night at 11 o'clock as can
didate for president jvith Thomas R.
Marshall as running mate. Nothing
sensational came out of the conven
tion as President Wilson was the only
candidate in the . field. A different
and stronger running mate was talked
of but the president put the quietus
on that talk by insisting on Mr. Mar
shall. '
Keynoten Glynn opened the conven
tion with a speech on "Americanism
and Peace, Preparedness and Pros
perity." He brought tears to the eyes
of peace loving Bryan when be de
clared: "We will fight and die for our
flag when reason points the rifles,
when honor draws the sworda. and
when justice breathes a blessing on
the cause that they uphold," all of
which is in perfect accord with the
present system of watchful waiting.
SELLS WILL NOT APPOINT
ATTORNEY IN RUNKE CASE
Indian Commissioner Cato Sells, in
replying to the resolutions sent to
him by the Flagstaff Boad of Trade
relative to the action of Supt Runke
which resulted in the killing of Taddy
Tin, the renegade Indian, refuses to
appoint an attorney from the Depart
ment of Justice for the defense of
the defendants.
This action by the commissioner Js
a bitter disappointment to the people
of Flagstaff .and those knowing the
exact state of affairs. The commis
sioner does not state that such an
appointment from his office could not
be 'made, but says that for "obvious
reasons" he does not consider it wise
to do so. He also states that it would
be "inappropriate" for him to assume
to interfere in the trial other than to
indicate his desire that the facts
shall be impartially presented. In
closing he "trusts that the facts when
presented to the court and jury will
justify acquittal."
It is plain that Mr. Sells is persu
ing the eas"y course in the matter and
is willing to see these men brought
to trial at their own expense in a
I cause that came on by themvperform-
nff their duty as officers of the Unit
ed States government. What action
could be more conducive to crime than-
J the one the Department of the Inter
ior is taking in this matter?
It is well known that the Indian
, witnesses at this trial will not say
.one word regarding the past depre-
. dations of Taddy Tin, although they
repcaieuiy cauea ior uie neip ol
, the reservation officers when he went
to their homes and took what he
1 . . . .. ". . .... . .1
jwisnca. it is a iraaiuon, 100 uecpiy
instilled mto their hearts to be up
rated by the law of any country, that
1 when a man is dead no discrediting
word must be said against him.
I It it were not for the fact that1 the
Indians held this belief regarding the
dead, there would be no question
about the outcome of the trial. Their
testimdny would convict and sentence
the deceased renegade to death with
! untold tortures. But as the case
stands, regardless of what the peo
ple on the reservation alid in Flag
staff know to be true, the defense"
may not be able to muster enough
unbiased evidence to make their
point
The indictment of Mr. Runke and
his officers was a plain misca'rriege of
justice and if this case comes to trial
it will be crime againt the people of
this state. Now is the time to unite
and leave nothing undone that will
help toward having a federal investi
gation on the case, Mr. Sells and his
Indian commission notwithstanding.
