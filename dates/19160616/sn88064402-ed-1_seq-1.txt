WiiLSON A D MARSHALL
NOMINATED BY ACCLIMATiON
At the Democratic National
Convention in St. Louis last .night
at 11:52 o'clock Woodrow Wilson
was re-nominated by acclimation,
as was also vice-president, Thos.
R. Marshall.
After Judge Westcott of New
Jersey had placed the president
in re-nomination, on motion of
Senator Hughes, the rules were
suspended and no ballots were
taken-the delegates s imply
roared "aye" when the names of
Wilson and Marshall were called.
Robert E. Burke, of Illinois,
ra s3d the only voice in opposi
sition, declaring he would not
vote for the president. He was
elected an independent.
The utmost harmony prevailed
throughout the entire session,
and this same spirit of harmony
bids fair to prevail in the coming
election.
LAKE ARTHUR CAMP NEETING.
The Lake Arthur Camp Meeting
will open July 13 with Rev. Maitlan
of Kansas City as evangelist. Many
who attended last year will remem
ber Rev. Maitlan as an unusual
speaker, one who preaches the gos
pel of Jesus Christ in all its purity,
yet in all reason, and he is consid
ered to be by far the best the asso
ciation has ever had. Mrs. Dr. Lyons
of Crowley will be the organist.
The manager, Mr. Toler of Crow
ley, expects to move his family on the
grounds about the first of July and
have veerything ready by the time
the meeting opens. The Association
will coilduct the boarding house this
year, with Mr. Toler as manager and
meals will be served for 25 cents. A
number of JenniAgs people are mak
ing plans to move on the grounds and
be there for the meetings and for
some time after.
