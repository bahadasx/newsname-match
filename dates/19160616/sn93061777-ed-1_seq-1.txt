Never Before Has There .
Manifested Generally
That Last Saturday.
Commissioners go Down to Ignominious Defeat.
The scenes enacted at the polls
last Saturday were perhaps only
equalled once before in Curry
county and that was at the lime
of the vote for the location of
the county seat. The strongest
battle was waged over the choice
for sheriff, county clerk and
Probate Judge. While the latter
named office does not come under
the class, fiction of a financial
plum, yet the issue was whether
the people would uphold or con
demn the official action of two
of the members of the old board
of county coTimissbners. They
took the latter course and nomi
nated C. V. Steed by an over
whelming majority. The t-ame
might bo said of the race b
eveen Cook and Hitchcock for
county surveyor. Tne latter
va generally conceded to have
been long affiliated with the
"gang" and consequently came
in for a good strong defeat. The
office of sherill' was the big bone
of contention. The forces of
Dean and Moye were about
equally divided and it was not
until the last returns were in
that the result was definitely
known. Ine surprise feature, m
Ithia race was that Moye beat
I t u.. i, rv ...u:..u
ueun uy 10 vui.es in icmuj woico
was considered a Dean siiong
hold and Dean beat Moye by
about 21 votes in Clovis which
was considered a Moye strong
hold. Await attributes his de
feat to some "double-crossing"
friends who traded him off
for their own candidates. Dow
had no opposition for District
attorney, his only remaining
opponent Mr. Gilbert having
given up the race and returned
to his home in Roswell early in
the week. There was likewise
no opposition to the candidacy of
Mersfelder for Senator, Bryan
for Commissioner and Bickley
for Superintendent of Schools,
Shaw won easily from Reece for
Representative although he had
committee. If Mr. Hughes'
statements when he makes them
shall satisfy the committee that
it is for the interest of the
country that he be elected, they
can act accordingly and treat
my refusal as definitely accepted.
If they are not satisfied they can
so notify the Progressive party
and at the same time they can
confer with me and the deter
mine on whatever action we may
severally deem appropriate to
meet the nerds of the country.
(Signed) "Theodore Roosevelt."

the county a huge sum of money.

Rumors of
Improvements
Last Been Confirmed. Work Already in Pro
gress on Track Extensions. Santa Fe Will Ex
pend Thousands in New Improvements.
Already the gangs of laborers
are at work putting in another
passenger track making four
tracks in front of the pissenger
station instead of three a-i at
present. Brick and concrete
crossings and walks will be laid
between the third and new
track as has been done with the
others.
DEPOT EXTENSION
The passenger depot is to be
enlarged. A two story addition
will be constructed which will
extend to the end of the cast
wing giving about 20x3(1 feet
square more lloir space on both
doors.
OTHER IMPROVEMENTS
The blacksmith shop will be
enlarged and remodeled to ac
comodate Hi" rapidly increasing
('emar; is et tne Company which
has jiiet closed one of the most
prosperous fiscal years in its
history.
APPRENTICE f-IIOl"
Along with the announcement
which has only this week been
officially verified, comes the re
port of the contemplated erection
of an apprentice shop, which in
size and equipment will be second
to none on the system between
Topeka and Frisco. Its location
is said to be just west of the
main buck shop and it will be
modern in every respect. A
considerable quantity of ad
ditional equipment will be added
to both the blacksmith shop and
apprentice shop.
THE HOSPITAL
The current number of the
Santa Fe Magazine in addition
to publishing a handsome half
tone cut of the new hospital has
the following to say regarding
that institution:

l'llllIM.N T WOlMMiOW WILSON
Who will be re -nominated Democratic Candidate f. r President of
the United States by the Democratic Convention which convened
I in St. Louis Wednesday.
Contemplated Have at
located at Clovis, N. M. Con
struction was commenced in
191 1, and the building was oc
cupied on October 8 of the same
year. It is of the most modern
fireproof construction and cost
$70,000. not including the furn
ishings The equipment is com
plete in every detail, including
refrigerating and ice-making
machinery capable of producing
one thousand pounds per day.
As at Mulvane, the hospital lo
cation at Clovis was chosen be
cause the various lines from the
east, west, north and south pass
through Clovis, permitting pa
tients to betaken to the hospital
without transferring them from
one train to another. It has a
capacity of fifty patients. That
it is in i healthful location is
attested by the results obtained
in the treatment of the various
cases brought there
For the eight months ending
June 31), 1915, the Clovis hospital
treated 2CS patients, a daily
average of 12 being cared for.
This was a highly credible shew
ing for a new hospital, and tho
average daily number treated
during the past year has been
gradually increasing. Dr. II. A.
Miller is in charge, assisted by
Dr. A. H. Cechn.
The plan originally adopted
for obtaining the ne:essary fund
was the deduction of specified
amounts from the wages of all
employes of the raildroad com
pany, varying from 25 cents to
$1, according to the total month
ly wage, and that plan, having
been found to be satisfactory, is
still being followed. The Clovis
Hospital, aside from the value
of the ground, cost $82,510.43.
Lieut. Hubart Miller is back
from Columbus again on recruit
ing duty.
