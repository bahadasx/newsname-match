Coliiieum, St. Louis, June 14. With
the keynote of "Americanism and
peace, preparedness and prosperity,"
the democratic national convention
began it first minion shortly after
noon today with not a single element
in sight to disturb the harmonious
renomination of President Wilnon and
Vica-Preiiidcnt Marshall.
When National Chairman McCombs
called the convention to order, twelve
thousand delegates, alternutes and
apecUtors packed the bin coliseum to
the roof.
Member of the national committee,
member of President Wilson's cabi
net and party Wader from all parti
of the country had places on the plat
form. Plaster madullion's of Wash
ington, Jackson, Jefferson and Cleve
land looked down upon the delegates
from the decorations which onalsted
uniformly of nothing but the Ameri
can flag. The only picture of Presi
dent Wilson in the hall hung in front
of the speaker! desk, inscribed
"America flrat".
Vice-presidential booms wilted by
President Wilson's direct word that
he desired the renomination of Vice
President Marshall, wen brought to
the convention hall but only as favor
ite sons compliment. "
When National Chairman McCombs
had called the con vention to order, the
next business waa tbo Meh of th
sil by Secretary J. Broca Kramer
Former Governor Glynn of New
(fork 1ri next with the introductory
speech.
Down under the speaker's stand di
rect telephone and telegraph wires to
th white house carried momentary re
ports of the proceedings m the hall.
All prospect of a fight in the conven
tion had gone glimmering overnight
with William J. Bryan' announce
ment that he did not propose to press
certain plank before th resolution
committee and that he would make
campaign speeches for the democratic
nominee.
"We have entered this hall as dem
ocrats, let u deliberate Ameri
cana," declared Mr. Glynn In sounding
the keynote.
"It is the business of the convention
representing every section of theUnlt
d Sutes, speaking for every racial
train In America, to aend forth a
mesaga to all th world that will
leave no room for doubt."
Reviewing President Wilson's con
duct of foreign affair he declared the
president had stood with Washington,
Adam and Grant, who had preserved
peace with honor.
"For vain glory or for selfish pur
pose," Mr. Glynn declared, "others
may cry for a policy of blod and Iron,
but the president has acted on the be
lief that the leader of a nation who
plunges his people into an unneces
sary war, like Pontius Pilate, vainly
washes hi hand of Innocent blood
while the earthquake and the heav
en are darkened and thousand give
up th ghoit If Washington i right,
if Jefferson was right, if Hamilton
waa right, then the president I right

AMERICANISM. PREPAREDNESS
PEACE. PROSPERITY, ISSUES.
President Haa the Blggeat Load of
Any Man Sine Lincoln and ia Mak
ing Good at It.
St. Louis, June 14. With the asser
tion that no president since the Civil
War has 'had aa crucial problems to
solve: and no president ha displayed
a grasp more sure, a statesmanship
more profuond( as President Wilson,
Hon. Hartin H. Glynn, former gover
nor of New York, opened the demo
cratic national convention here today.
Declaring that "Americanism and
paece, preparedness and prosperity
are the issues upon which the demo
cratic party stands, and the heart of
democracy swells with pride that is
more than a pride of party, as it hails
the man, who has assorted this Ameri
canism, assured this peace, advocated
this preparedness and produced this
prosperity" he predicted the re-election
of President Wilson.
Taking up our foreign relations that
has been culled into emphatic promi
nence by the world-wide war the
speaker declared that "we have on
tared this hall as democrats; we shall
deliberate as Americans" .... The
policy of neutrality, he argued, is as
truly American as the American flag.
For two hundred years neutrality was
a theory; America made it a fact. "It
took Washington and his successors
eighty years of endless negotiations to
win recognition ofAmeriran neutrality
And this eighty years of struggle wove
the doctrine of neutrality so closely
into the warp and woof of our nation
al life that to tear it out now would
unravel the very threads of our exis
tence." By the records of history Mr.
Glynn maintained that if Washington
and Lincoln were right, President Wil
son is right The neutrality that Pres
ident Wilson stands for today wait ad
vocated by Washington, by llumilton,
by Jefferson and by Lincoln.
By citing precedents Mr. Glynn
justified and defended the course of
the president in the Lusifania and
similar incidents. "In the faca of this
record," he asked: "Do rapublcans
realixo that when they arraign the
policy of the president of the United
States today they arraign the policy
nf Harrison, of Bluine, of Lincoln and
of Grant? For the pleasure of criticis
ing a democratic president, are they
willing to read out of the republcan
party the greatest men the republi
can party ever had? Are they willing
to say that the republican party of to
day condemns what Hamilton did in
revolutionary days what Lincoln did
in Civil war days and what Grant and
Blaine and Harrison did but yester
day? "In his policy of peaceful negotia
tions today the president of the Unit
ed State follow the example let him.
by the greatest president which the
democratic party and the greatest
president the republican party ever
gave this nation."
Mr. Glynn Impressed on his hearers
that It was the business of this con
vention "representing every section of
th United States, speaking for every
racial strain Jn Amerca, to send forth
a massage to all the world that will
leave no room for doubt.
"W must enable every real Ameri
can to stand up and assert hi Am
ericanism. W must mske the issue
so clear that every ballot box in the
land may become a monument to the
loyalty of American manhood.
"Th citizens of this country must
stand behind their president because
his policies are right They must
stand behind him because his policies
are the policio which have brought
the nation a century of prosperity
and honored peace. They will stand
behind him because they want the
policies continued, that prosperity
prolonged, and that peace assured."
He pointed out that the promise
made four year ago that a democratic
administration would liberate the na
tion from th chains of industrial ty
lanny has been carried out. He eulo
gized the Federal Reserve act and de
clared that the "Scholar-statesman,
whose rod has struck the golden rock
of America's resources to set free the
wealth imprisoned for half a century,
is a Moses who has led America's in
dustries from the wilderness of doubt
and despair to the Promised Land of
Prosperity and Hope."
The Inws restraining big business
from stifling competition, the trades
commission act, the movement to fos
ter expansion of American trade, the
close union of economic, commercial
and flanacial interests between th
United State and the nations of South
America are shown to be legislation
of the widest benefit. The Underwood
tariff, Mr. Glynn characterized a the
fairest and the best of all we have
enacted. Under the present adminis
tration the United Sutes has enjoyed
a wonderful era of good business and
good times.
The Aneriran's Ideals and his aspi
rations served as the basis for th
speaker's opening discussion.
"We who aUnd today on the fertile
soil of America, who live under the
smiling skies of a free and fruitful
land, must prove worthy of the trust
that American sacrifico has Imposed
on every American.
"Disregarding th division that

make on man a Tory and another a
Whig, on man a republican and an
other a democrat, Americans will cast
aside the tinsel of party labels and
the mummery of party emblems.
"From the grout pulsing heart of th
nution will come a pulriot command
to crush partisanship and rebuke what
ever is mean or blind.
"That command will be heurd by
the ploughman in his Held, and by the
luliorer at his bench. It will reach
Hhe merchant In his office and the law
yer at his desk. We would be fulse to
ourselves, and recreant to those who
send us here if we permitted any
thought of partisan profit, and consid
eration of political advanUge to ob
scure our vision of the tremendous is
sues now before the people of the Un
ited SUtes. We must cast aside all
that is selfish, we must hold ourselves
worthy of a nution's confidence by of
fering onl the best of our intelligence
the flower of our patriotism toward
the solution of what all men perceive
to be a crisis in the nation's affairs."
In asking for an endorsement of the
president's peace policy, Mr. Glynn
said:
"For t'vo years the world has been
afire; the civilization that we know
has been torn by the mightiest strug
gle Jn its history. Sparks from Eu
rope's conflagration have blazed in our
own skies, echoes of her strife have
sounded at our very doors. That fire
still burns, that struggle still contin
ues, but thus fur the United Rutes
has held the flame at Iwy; thus far
It hus utvnd its nennle from Dartiolnu-
j tion in the conflict.
"What the people of the United
State must determine through their
suffrage, is whether th course the

whether the principle that have been

Funston'a Command.
First Official Admission nf I .ark of
Carranrlsta Co-operation Comes
With Statement by Secretary Lans
ing That Situation Grows Steadily
Worse.
Washington, June 12. The, war de
partment tonight ordered 1,0(10 coast
artillery and 600 engineers to the
Mexican border, increasing General
Funston's force in Mexico and on the
bolder to about 60,000.
These troop were sent to the bor
der following the receipt of official
reports that conditions of unarchy aie
fast spreading ia Mexico and General
Pershing's army i facing an ever
present threat of attack by Mexican
forces.
SecreUry Lansing volunteered the
sUUment tonight that the situation in
Mexico ia steadily growing worse.
State department reports, he said,
show that where some Carranza au
thorities are making efforts to sup
press anti-American demonstrations,
most of them are indifferent.
This wus the first ofllciul udmiss'on
that the Carranza authorities are not
"co-operating" with tho American
forces. Considered in connection with
the action of the war department in
sending additional troops to the bor
der, Mr. Lansing's statement whs re
garded as forecasting drastic changes
in the Mexican policy.
On the eve of the convening of M
lemocrutic convention in S.. Louis,
today's developments were r ir.sli tied
as indicating '.bat some imimrtunl
step in Mexico is under cot hMi ration.
Brigadier Gere'al Albert I.. Mills,
acting chief of stuff, suid that the
eleven companies of coast artillery
ordered to the border today would be
taken from the following forts:
Two cmpunies from Portland, Maine,
two from Huston, two from Nu.'rag
unsett buy, two from the five forts on
Long Island suml, one from Fort Tot
ten, one from Fort llumilton and one
from Fort Hancock, ut Sandy Hook.
The 500 engineers ordered to the
border were stationed ut Washing
ton. Funston Has Entire Mobile Army.
With the dispatch of these forces
the only mobile troops left In conti
nental United States will be u squad
ron of the Second cavalry ut Fort
Myer, Vu., which is guarding Wash
ington. There are about 12,000 coast
artillery to druw on besides the 2000 i
now on the border or under orders.
Advance Notice to Carranza.
With the 0.42H recruits recently en
listed in the army und the fi.OOO or
more national guurd on border putrol
duty, Generul Funston has a force of
about fiO.000 troops, representing nil
brunches of tho service, us tho nuclues
of any force needed for u campaign
in Mexico.
Today's troop orders were consid
ered us un advance notice to General
'arrunza that this government's
forthcoming note will bo a flat re
jection of his demands for withdrawal
of American troops.
There was renewed discussion to-
day of the possibilities of intervention
and some olliciuls admitted that Pres
ident Wilson probably would approve
this course if forced into it by nn
armed attack nn American troops in
Mexico or by the spread of anti
American demonstrations and border
outlawry.

MATED
SITUATION NEVER MOKE SER
IOUS DECLARES GEN. FUNSTON.
San Antonio, Texns, June 12. The
sincerity of the allrgcd "co-operation"
of Carranza troops with Ameri
can soldiers in ridding the border zona
of bandits and putting down brigan
dage wus pretty well indicated to
night. Reliable word was brought to
Sun Antonio that at least one of tho
three Luis de la Itosu outluws killed
by u sheriff's posse near Cactus, Webb
county, toduy oro u Carrancista uni
form, and carried in his breast pocket
a captain's commission in the first
chief's army.
"The border situation was never
more critical than it hus been the
past four days," Major General Fred
erick Funston said tonight. "Appar
ently a large part of the gravity of it
has blown over, but you never can
tell."
When shown Washington dispatches'
that the sUte department was wor
ried over the situation because of
sinister reports from consuls and con
sular agents in Mexico, General Fun
ston said:
"I am glad somebody beside m
Is beginning to worry a little."
Tonight the situation around Lar
edo apparently was this:
T. A. Coleman denied that his ranch
at Hidalgo, thirty-five miles from l.ar-'
rdo, was raided, as reported lute yes
terday. Mexicun bandits, however,
under the direction of Luis de la Rosa,
were operating in Webb county, Tex.
They were reported in two encoun
ters, losing two captured and three
killed, with no American casualties.
Captain Olu Hell, with one troop
of the Fourteenth cavalry, did not
lead n third punitive expedition across
tho Itio Grande, as General Funston
was led to believe by a report from '
General Mann, at Laredo; but Bell hud
Lis men ready to pursue the bandit
in any direction.
A dispatch late today from Gen
eral Mann reported that u bui;d of Ic
la Rosa bandits appeared yesterday nt .
I'alafox, in Webb county. At 10
o'clock last night they were seen ut '
Webb, in the same county supposedly
intent on destroying railroad bridges .
Captain Wellborn, witli u squad of the .
Ninth infantry, encountered them and
captured two
Posse Runs Into Bandits.
This morning u posse under the
sheriff of Webb county run ufoul of
the bandits in the vicinity of Cactus,
and killed three. None nf the dis
patches mentioned the numerical
strength of tho outlaws.
A report to Generul Funston today
from Lieutenant Generul Waterman,
ut lluchitu, suid u patrol of three men
of tho Twelfth ruvalry was attacked
by two Mexicuns between '. and 10
o'clock on Saturday night at monu
ment II, near lluchitu. Private I,ee
Sanders was wounded Lieutenant
l ong, with a detachment of the Twel
fth, pursued the bandits. General
Funston assumed that "monument 41"
was one of the stones marking the
international boundary.
