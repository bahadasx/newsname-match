GIRL DROWNS WHEN
BATHING IN CREEK
NORTH OF BRANSON
Miss Wilma Patterson, Aged 14,
Daughter of Prominent Merchant,
Either Seized with Cramps
or Stepped Into Hole
'Branson, Mo., June 14. Miss Wil
ma Patterson, aged 14 years, daughter
of Robert J. Patterson, Jr., a promi
nent merchant of Branson, was
drowned in Roark creek, a tributary
of Lake Taneycomo, about 6:30 o'clock
this evening. Miss Patterson was a
member of a swimming party that had
gone to the banks of the creek just
north of town and it is thought that
she was seized with cramps or that
she stepped into a treacherous water
hole. The girl dragged with her a
younger companion, little Helen Hef
lin, who managed to escape from the
clutches of the drowning girl and
swim back to the bank.

GREAT ENTHUSIASM
DURING GLYNN'S
KEYNOTE SPEECH
St. Louis Democratic Convention
Hears the Governor's Speech with
Cheers and Wild Demonstra
tions St. Louis, June 14. The democrat
ic national convention, at its first ses
sion today, heard the -keynote speech
of Americanism and peace, prepared
ness and prosperity sounded by for
mer Governor Glynn of New York as
temporary chairman, and with a high
pitch of enthusiasm, emphatically reg
istered by demonstration after dem
onstration, its approval of President
Wilson's peaceful conduct of foreign

affairs.
The convention, which had gotten
under way with such perfunctory dem
onstrations as mark every, national
gathering of the kind, soon stirred it
self into roaring cheers as Chairman
Glynn cited historic parallels to show
that other residents, including re
publicans, had adjusted threatening
foreign situations without resort to
war.
"The policy of the administration,"
he declared, "has been just as Ameri
can as the American flag itself."
As he went down the list of presi
dents, recounting their action to avoid
war, the delegates caught the spirit of
his argument, and as he referred to
each particular president some dele
gate would call: "What did he do?"
"He settled the trouble by negotia
tion," was the reply which Glynn in
variably returned and the convention
would roar its approval. William J.
Bryan, as a newspaper correspondent
in tne press stana, wept wim emouuu
as Glynn pictured the victories of
peace, but he laughed with the crowd
when a Texas delegate, interrupting
Glynn, leaped to his chair and cried:
"And don't forget that policy also
is satisfactory to William J. Bryan."
Aside from a sixteen-minute dem
onstration when Chairman Glynn's
speech was sprinkled with demonstra
tions which he found it difficult to
stem so he could go on. It was plain
that the telling points on the delegates
were the recital of President Wilson's
effort to keep the country at peace.
"This policy," he said, "may not sat
isfy the fire-eater and the swash
buckler, but it does satisfy the moth
ers of the land, at whose hearth and
fireside no jingoistic war ha placed
an empty chair. It aec3 satisfy the
daughters of this land from whom
bluster and brag have sent no lovingi
brother to the dissolution of the grave
It does satisfy the fathers of this land
and the sons of this land who will
fight for our flag u"l die for our flag
when reason primes the rifle, when
honor draws the sword and when jus
tice breathes a blessing on the stand
ard they uphold."
The last of the words were drowned
out in a roar of applause that swept
the Coliseum.
"Repeat it," cried the delegates.
"Repeat it."
"All right, be quiet and I'll repeat
it," responded Mr. Glynn, and he did,
to applause and cheering.
No other president since tne Liva
war, Mr. Glynn told the convention,
had faced such crucial problems, none
had displayed a grasp of statesman
ship more profound.
After hearing the keynote speech,
the convention adjourned until 11 o'
clock tomorrow. Committees then
went into session to prepare their
work for the convention.
WILSON AGAINST JUDGE PLANK
Asks the Democratic Convention Not
to Play Petty Politics
Washington, June 14. Efforts to
insert a plank in the Democratic plat
form favoring a law to prohibit feder
al judges from leaving the bench to
accept elective office' will not be coun
tenanced by President Wilson. Ad
ministration officials let it be known
that the President had sent word to
St. Louis that he did not want petty
politics played.

SAFEGUARD OTHER
PEOPLE'S CHILDREN
"Whenever it is necessary, for the
welfare of the children, to insist that
one or more families be quarantined,"
says the July Woman's Home Com
panion, "it is astonishing how fre
quently this is taken as a personal in
sult by the parents . It seems to be
considered as an infringement upon
the family rights and not for one mo
ment to be tolerated."
This editorial has to do with a
widespread evil. It says further:
"A striking instance came to notice
recently in a suburban town. For
some weeks sporadic cases of diph
theria had been appearing. Every care
was taken to find out the source of the
trouble but all to no avail. There
were carriers at large, and no one
knew who was responsible. So it was
decided to make a systematic examin
ation of the throats of the school chil
dren, and to send cultures of all sus
picious-looking cases to the laboratory
It was found that twenty-five per cent
of these cultures gave a positive re
action, so, of course, these children
were promptly banished, and quaran
tine ordered by the board of health.
The nature of the work and the ne
cessity for these precautions were ex
plained to the parents in every in
stance; nevertheless, some of these
same parents were very angry, and
tried various devices to break the
quarantine. One of the mothers
threatened a law suit unless her child
was promptly taken back to school
and the sign put on her house by order
of the board of health immediately re
moved !
"Another mother entirely ignored
the notice sent to her, and flatly re
fused to keep her child in the house,
though she knew he was not well when
she sent him to school . It was sever,
al hours after this child had been sent
home before the mother could be
brought to terms. Meanwhile, to spite
the authorities who had perpetrated
this outrage upon her family by bar
ring her boy out of school, she sent
him over to one of her neighbors to
play with the children . Two of these
children promptly contracted diph
theria, and the younger one, scarcely
more than a baby, developed a malig
nant type and died in two days. It
Chas. E. Mansfield
Monett, Missouri
would certainly be using a harsh ex
pression to say that the child was mur
dered, and yet if he had been neatly
shot he would have suffered far less . "

EAST BROADWAY
WASTES $80,000 ON ROADS
In Twenty Years the Present Annual
Expenditures will Aggregate More
Than Permanent System of
202 Miles Would Cost
Liberty, Mo., June 14. Clay Coun
ty spent $80,000 last year grading,
dragging and otherwise temporizing
with its dirt roads trying to make
them passable. Most of the winter
and a large part of the summer they
were not. The money largely was
wasted.
Clay county assumes no special
blame for this poor investment. It.
merely did what dozens of other Mis
souri counties are doing, except that
being richer than most counties it had
more money to waste. However, it
does assume responsibility for the fu
ture. It has been giving close atten
tion to the question since a bond issue
for permanent roads was proposed,
and it has discovered to its amaze
ment that at the present rate of ex
penditure on dirt roads it actually will .
spend more money in twenty years
than the entire cost of building and
maintaining a complete system of 202
miles of hard roads under the bond
plan.
To reduce it to figures the perma
nent roads will cost XV million dol
lars. There is twenty years to pay.
Twenty years at $80,000 a year for
dirt roads will cost $1,600,000, and no.
roads either.
