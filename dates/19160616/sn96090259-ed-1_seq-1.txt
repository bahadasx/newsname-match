HOME FROM
CONVENTION
S. E. WILSON, ONE OF THE DEL
EGATES TO CHICAGO
WRITES OF BIG MEETING
FEELS THAT HUGHES IS BOUND TO BE
THE SUCCESSFUL CANDIDATE
FOR PRESIDENT
S. E. Wilson, one of the delegates
from this state to the National Repub
lican oonvention in Chicago last week
arrived home Monday very entbus
iastio about the result of the big meet
ing and feeling very sure that Hughes
will be the jiext president.
The South Dakota delegates fared
very well in the oonvention in that
Mr. Wilson was selected as a member
of the oommittee on credentials, James
O. Stanley, of Lead, was selected as
one of the oommittee to notify Hughes
of his nomination and Senator Sterl
ing, also of this state, was a member of
the oommittee on resolutions. Gov
ernor Byrne was ohairman of the Soatb
Dakota delegation.
The delegates from this state were
instraoted for Albert B. Cummins, of
Iowa, and oast their vote for him until
it beoame apparent that he ooald not
be "nominated when they voted for
Hughes. Mr. Wilson had the honor to
be ohosen as the man to make the
seconding speech at the time Cummins
was placed in nomination and that he
acquitted himself with credit before
the large audienoe of sixteen thousand
people is assured.
Feeling that many people of the city
aid county would like to hear some of
the more intimate facts regarding the
oonvention we prevailed upon Mr
Wilson to furnish us with the follow
ing write-up of the big meeting whioh
we know will be interesting reading.
Mr. Wilson says:
"The big Oonvention at the Coliseum
at Chicago last week was in many ways
different from the average National
Conventions. The delegates were
there, most of them uninstruoted, with
the intention of selecting if it could in
their judgement be done a candidate
who would meet the requirements and
demands of the great majority of the
republican party. There was no*
muoh hero.worship exhibited, not so
muoh as four years ago nor nearly so
muoh as was displayed in the oonven-
tAuditorium.Senator
tion in session at the same time in the
Harding, of Ohio,
was aeleoted as both temporary and
permanent ohairman of the conven
tion. His keynote speeoh was char
aoteristio of the many great orators of
that mother of presidents, Ohio. It
bristled with sound republioanism, it
abounded in eipgrams and alliterative
expressions exposing the "watchful
waiting, wobbling warfare" oharaoter
istio of the demooratlo administration.
'It elicited oonstant response from the
oonvention, frequently bringing the
delegates to their feet in appreciation
of the sentiments expressed I say
this with full knowledge of the inoor
reot statements made by some news
papers about the effeot of this Bpeeeh.
The National Oommittee had been in
session four days hearing the contested
oases, mostly between the colored del
agates from the southern states. These
oases were all brought before the Cre
dentials Committee of which 1 was a
.member. The hearing before the oom
mittee was of necessity limited, and
the casep were all disposed of during
the afternoon and night of the first
day, in whioh the N atlonal Committee
was sustained in most of the contests.
Friday was fire oraoker day, when
$the nominating orators were let loose
^jin unlimited numbers and unlimited
length of speeches. Gov. Whitman, of
New York, let out and placed the win
ner, Hughes, in nomination. The
.oheering lasted twenty minutes. Root
waR next named *nd oheered fourteen
minutes. Another Ohio orator, Gov.
Willis, came to the front of the plat
form with a baby elephant under his
14^ arm and in a real old fashioned Buck
eye stump speech, in whioh he extolled
the elephant and flayed the mule,
electrified the oonvention and put in
I nomination Senator Burton, Ohio's
I favorite son, who was eheeced for
thirty-two minutes, Senator Lodge
I in a dignified, pointed and etateman
like speeoh nominated Massachusetts'
favorite
son, Senator Weeks. He had
to be satisfied with two minutes'
cheers, though he was high man on the
first ballot of the favorite son candi
dates, with 105 votes being next to
Hughes. Then followed the nomina
tions of Fairbanks of Indiana, Du Pont
the powder maker of Deleware, Sher
man, of Illinois,whose friends put up a
ob with the Illinois doorkeepers and
ran in a oouple of thousand rounders
under guise of the Hamilton Club,
until the fire marshall butted in,
throwing doorkeepers, polioemen and
everybody out of the way and olosed
the doors in order to proteot the build
ing whioh was then taxed beyond its
oapaoity. Thousands of people with
tickets were denied admission during
the remainder of the day, whioh of
course made them all hot. But the
fire marshal's authority was superior
to that of everybody else. Then fol
lowed the nomination of Senator Cum*
mins of Iowa by Ex-Congressman Ken
dall, of that state, who, it was oonoeded
by all, made one of the very best
speeches of the oonvention. The
oheering of the Senator's name lasted
twenty minutes, and waB oonoeded to
have been participated in by the dele
gates from more states than any other
oandidate. He received the solid votes
of four states on both the first and
seoond ballots, whioh was the largest
of any favorite son oandidate, exoept
Weeks, of whioh there were nine put in
nomination, and also received more
votes than Col. Roosevelt at any time.
His oandidaoy was supported by the
South Dakota delegation, under in
structions of the republican state pri
mary.
Roosevelt was put in nomination by
Senator Fall of New Mexico, and the
real demonstration of the oonvention
ooourred, not so muoh by the dele
gates as by the fifteen thousand visit
ors in the galleries. It was my privil
age to be on the platform at this junot
ure, waiting my turn to seoond the
nomination of Cummins, and I had a
splendid opportunity to observe the
countenances of many members of the
old guard seated there, or rather stand
ing and watching the tumultuous
demonstration. They bespoke the
greatest anxiety and impressed
me with the belief that they
were trying to fathom the real depth
of feeling of the most admired, best
loved and best bated man in the Re
public. It was apparent that no other
oandidate had matched him in the af
feotions of the audienoe. The cheer
ing continued forty-two minutes and
then had to be checked by the chair
man's gavel, or it might have been
going yet. But oheering don't nomi
nate candidates. The delegates do that.
Out of a total of 987 votes he received
sixty, five votes on first, eighty on seo
ond and eighteen and one-half on
third. He had not allowed his name
to go on the primary ballot in any
state where he oould prevent it.
Hence, the great body of voters had no
opportunity to express their oboioe

the Colonel's own plan in the
campaign. Many of his friends think
it was a mistake.
The nominations of the rest of the
nine favorite sons followed, and in the
first ballot Hughes led with 2531-2
votes and gained seventy-five votes on
the seoond, and was nominated by a
vote of 949 1 2 out of a total vote of
987 on the third. The nomination was
then made unanimous, and at about
the same time Roosevelt was unani
mously nominated by the progressives,
Fairbanks was nominated on first
ballot for vice-president. Hughes im
mediately resigned from his position
on the Supreme Court bench and ao
oapted, with a ringing statement, bristl
ing with real Americanism and indors
ing the republican platform. Roose
velt tentatively declined the progres
sive nomination, waiting to know fully
the position of Hughes on prepared
ness and other vital issues to whioh
the Colonel is so flrmely attached, and
now the paramount question is will he
indorse the republican nominee. If be
does, Hughes' eleotion is assured. If
he don't indorse but refuse to run,
Hughes will be eleoted anyhow, We
believe he will support Hughes, or at
least refuse to run."
William B. Petty and Miss Beatrice

HARNEY CANYON A PARADISE
Jcnsen
The government thru the forest re
serve department has just oompleted
the oonneoting road thru the Hills on
the other side of the Lake and a trip
over the three miles into the Canyon
is simply great. The road for ten
thousand feet makes a seven per oent
grade up the mountain side winding
backward and forward with six switch
backs and in several places three and
four of the roads may be seen below
yon when near the summit. In one
plaoe a larger tunnel thru solid rook

we were due at the Canyon for break

obtain an early start.
Most everyone in this section has

from the Lake on to Harney Canyon
is even more wonderful.

As everyone knows this part of the
Hills is styled the Switzerland of
America and for picturesque valleys,
mammoth spruce and other pine trees
on the sides of towering mountains of
almost solid rook, oocl mountain
streams filled with trout and other fish
after a trip over this route, travelers
may rest assured that the Alp* may be
loftier many times but not a bit more
wonderful in soenio beauty.
With Leslie Jensen as driver of one
of the best jitneys in the Hills we ar
rived fit the Canyon on schedule time
and sure enough were treated to a
most appetizing breakfast, Despite a
little shower Mr. Jensen, Sr., the pro
prietor of the plaoe, insisted upon
showing us his domain and it ie a par
adise to say the least. Chris has ereot
ed several log cabins from »ome of the
spruce trees of whioh there are many,
and these cabins are commodious and
comfortable. In addition he has in*
numerable sleeping tents, a garage
and jtll ihe necessities for a tourist or
oamper.
The Harney Inn, whioh is the main
building is situated on Harney Cr6ek.
This creek has been converted into a
small siz?d lake by building a large
dam just below the Inn. Later he in
tends to utalize the water power de
veloped by the dam for lighting pur
poses by installing a dynamo. There
is plenty of trout in the creek whioh
flows past the plaoe so that fresh Llsh
will always be part of the menu during
the summer.
Besides building trails to Harney
Peak, which is ja6t west of the Canyon,
Mr. Jensen has platted some of the land
just below bis plaoe and many lots
have already been sold to South Da
kota parties where summer oabins will
be erected. One of the latest additions
to thv colony is Editor Zimmers, of
Bowclle, this state, who expects to ar
rive early next month to build his
cabin. We visited the site of his lots
whioh were picked out by Mr. Jensen
and they are certainly ideal.

afternoon
after
a oonnteous meal
served by Mrs. Mary McKay, who has
leased the Inn for tle summer from
Mr. Jensen, and we can assure tourists
who visits Harney Canyon this sum

oordial and courteous treatment from
Mr. Jensen and wife and meals that

they spend their vaoation at one of
the prettiest little spots in the Hill*.
It oan be reached either by rail or auto

Louisiana democrats laud President
Wilson as a "leader" in preparedness.
They seem to forget tha the only mat
ter in which he has really lead was
in placing sugar on the free list, which
the democrats in congress very reluO'
tantly agreed to do. It took a later act
of congress to retain a one-cent per
pound duty on that most important
product of Lousiana, But for the in
sistence of Woodrow Wilson, sugar
would never have been on the free list.
Strange how short some peoples mem

BETTER FARMING
CAMPAIGN
BIG CROWDS ATTENDED MEET
INGS LAST WEEK
L.E. CLEVELAND'S REPORT
INTERNATIONAL HARVESTER COM
PANY'S SPEAKERS BREW BIG
CROWDS AT VARIOUS POINTS
The better farming oampaign whioh
is being conducted by the International
Harvester Oompauy in the various
oounties in the Western part of this
state, drew big crowds to their meet
ings last Thursday. Below we give
the report of the ohairman of
the agricultural committee of the
Commercial Club, L. E. Cleveland,
who was present at some of the meet
ings, the report below being the one
submitted at the meeting of the Club
Monday evening:
"The live stook, dairy, silo, alfalft*,
sweet olover oampaign, was launohed
in Fall River county on Thursday,
June 8lh, before largo and enthusiastic
audienoes, and from information which
we have been able to gather it appears
that there were present at the various
meetings, about four hundred of the
most enterprising farmers of the
oounty, and great good must surely
oome soon as a result.
The speakers were all the very best
obtainable, being praotioal men of
national reputation who have been
seleoted by The International Harvest
er Co. to assist them in bringing more
prosperity to western South Dakota.
Each man had with him a chart pro
pared to show the comparative values
of the different forage crops and the
eoonomio necessity of having live stock
enough to consume all the feed pro
duoed on eaoh and every farm.
The dairy subject was treated fully
and it was indioated clearly, that this
line of industry will bring permanent
prosperity to this part of the country
sooner and surer than any other one
thing.
Everyone present at the meetings
spoke in highest words of praise of the
movement and they will look forward
with pleasure for the return of these
men at some future date. Agricultural
Oommittee, Hot Springs Commercial
Oiub."
COMMENCING TO KNOCK
The Edgemont Express Hands Hot Springs
a Neat Little Package
Edgemont Express: "The Burlington
started the new train from Hot
Springs to meet 43 Sunday afternoon,
and also train 142 arrived at 8:05 in
stead of 7:35 as in times past. The
train is receiving a little patronage but
not nearly enough to
make
it pay,
which is somewhat good newq to our
people here who have invested their
money in big rooming bouses aud
other
lineB
of industry. For one the
Express hopes the train will not pay
and will be pulled off."
The above article is clipped from the
Bdgemont Express of last week and
oertainly shows a flue spirit—we don't
think. As a matter of fact the new
train servioe reoently put ou is one of
the best things inaugurated in recet
years, It has been well patronized and
is a big benefit to Hot Springs visitors
going west and also for lnooming
passengers. With this train and the
new sleeper accommodation put on by
the Northwestern this week, Hot
Springs is just coming into her own
after years of indifferent train servioe
and then to have the Edgemont people
hand us a left handed slap doesn't go
very well. Hot Springs is going after
the tourist business this year and
every year from now on and we hardly
think a little short sighted knocking
will be other than a ^oost. Think .'
over Brother Goddnrd and Bee if you
didn't make a mistake this time.
THE BATTLE CRY OF PEACE'
Charles Richman in Big Film With a Big
Message June 2lst-22nd
Boston Journal: "Ihe Battle Cry of
Peace" is a big mission.
That fact was shown conclusively at
the Majestio Theatre yesterday, when
this seoond extraordinary Amerioan
photo-speotaole had its initial present
ation in Boston.
From a patriotio point of view, this
soreen spectacle should stay in Bos(op
Vol. 31 'No. 9
until the cause of national defense—
which means defense of home and
hearth and relatives as well as defense
of forts and trenohes—has been given
an impetus that will carry it on to
victory. It is the mot,t striking battle
film of the age, in that it illustrates
what would happen if any first-olacs
foreign power, such as England is to
day, or Franoe, or Germany, should at
tack the United States, The soenes
are harrowing, but they are not over
drawn. They might even be used to il
lustrate the latest report of the secre
tary of the navy—a volume every page
of whioh is a warning to the Amerioan
people that there is no military estab
lishment today on whioh Amerioan
security against invasion oan be based.
"The Battle Cry of Peeoe" visualizes
the arguments of Amerioan army and
navy offloials, of military experts, of
patriotio oitlzena who have banded to
gether in suoh organizations as the
Amerioan Legion and the National
Secretary League. It was adapted by
CHARLES RICHMAN
In "The Battle Cry of Peace'
President J. Stuart Blaokton of the
Vitagraph Film Company from Hud
sou Maxim's book, "Defenseless Amer
ica," and it may fairly be desoribed as
a timely, powerful, vivid and faithful
presentation in pioture form of the
settled conventions of one of the fore
most military expertB of the day. It
reveals in dramatio form the feeling
that has taken possession of watohful
oltizens all over the land.
The lesson is driven home not only
bj statistics, in particular those indi
Oiting the inadequate navy now at the
disposal of the oounty if any emer
gency should turn up, but by piotures
showing the direful etfeots of an in
vasion upon homes subject to the
oruelties of invasion. One is the home
of a typioal disarmament advooate,
whose millennial notions are enoonr
ajed by spies who work shoulder to
shoulder with him in defeating appro
priations for national defense.
Charles Riobman, the star of the
oompany engaged for the produotion
by the Vitagraph Oompany, takes the
part of an Amerioan who believes in
preparing for war during times of
peaoe, and who struggles heroically to
save the honor of his country and of
his sweetheart when the dreadful blow
falls. Mr. Riohman's acting is spirited
and artietio.
There are pictures of extraordinary
brilliancy and realism depioting New
York in all its present glory—and then
in its fall under the ruthless h»nd of
the invader. In the finale there is a
vision soene as of the country awaken
ed and fully armed and proud of its
power to oommand peaoe.
Suitable desoriptive

is per-
imed by a large orohestra. At the
