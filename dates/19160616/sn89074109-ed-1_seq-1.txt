The Farmers' Paper
VOLUME XII
City Dads Met
Monday Night
Automobile Ordinance Passed
Second and Final Reading.
—Street "Policemen"
Must be Obeyed.
An adjourned meeting of the
city council was held Monday
evening in the Auditor T. E. Hud
son's office in the Farmers and
Merchants bank. The meeting
was for the purpose of attending
to business unfinished at the
former meeting.
The city automobile ordinance
passed its second and final read
ing. According to the terms of
the ordinance, guide posts or
street "policemen" will be erected
at once on all the principal thor
oughfares of the city for the pur
pose of guiding autonuobilists in
the matter of keeping to the right
side of the street. This is a need
ed measure, and will be welcom
ed by our citizcns as well as all
who drive a car. The collision
which occurred at the Beach State
bank corner Tuesday morning is
an example of the ease with which
accidents may occur when auto
mobile drivers pass on the wrong
side of the street, and could easily
have been avoided if both driv
ers had passed on the proper side.
Though posts will be erected on
the principal thoroughfares only,
the ordinance applies to all
streets of the city, and its provi
sions will be enforced rigorously,
a stiff fine being the penalty for
nonobservance.
A gate and lock was provided
for the band stand, this being the
general rendezvous of transients
and drunks. The property has
been marred and disfigured in the
past by idlers, and the provision
of a means to protect it from fu
ture depredations is a wise mea
«ure.
A number of bills were allow
ed, following which the council
ndjourncd until the next regular
meeting.
COUNTY SHOULD HAVE
GOOD ROADS WEEK.
A proclamation has been issued
by the governor declaring June
19th to 24th to be Good Roads
AVeek throughout the state, and
urging the communities of the
state to take an active part in
road betterment through a gener
al co-operative effort during that
week. Billings county already has
a Good Roads Week campaign
under way, and farmer, rancher
and business man, whether an
automobile owner or not, have
dedicated their efforts to road irn
provement for one of the six days
The idea is a good one and speaks
well for the initiative of our sis
ter county. Golden Valley
county, with a larger population
and therefore a larger opportun
ity for recruiting workers, shouh
not be left behind. Our need is
fully as great as theirs. Why
not have a genuine Good! Road
Week here as well
It is very evident from the var
ious National Highway activities
that North Dakota is to be favored
with at least four National High
ways, namely, The Wonderland
Trail, The National Parks High
way, The Meridan Road and The
Great Plains Road. To get the
full effectiveness of these Nation
al Highways the roads leading in
to them must be equally as effi
cient as the National Highways
themselves. This of itself is suf
ficient reason why this communi
ty should bestir itself at
least during this Good Roads
"Week—to some real concrete act
ivity for the improvement of the
roads in the immediate vicinity.
There are bumps, sags in the
Toad bed and bad strips of road

on every highway leading into
Beach. Every farmer who hauls
a load or has an automobile is
familiar with them. They should
'be filled. Good Roads Week pre
sents the opportunity. All that
is needed is co-operation. Why
not organize a campaign, now?
LITTLE BEAVER DEFEATS.
YATES IN FAST GAME.
In a spirited contest at th Yates
grounds Sunday afternoon, Little
Beaver defeated the Yates con
tingent by a score of 13 to 11.
This was Little Beaver's first
game of the season. Batteries:
Little Beaver, Nelson, Bowman
and Houck Yates, Lenertz and

In the eighth inning the score
stood 8 to 2 in favor of Little
Beaver, when Bowman was sent
in to relieve Nelson in the box. He

We have been requested to an
nounce that W. Hahn, 77 Walnut,
will be pleased to hear from any
of the small town teams wishing
games.
Candidate for County Treasurer on the Republican Ticket.
Mr. Noble is one of the very early settlers of the Golden Valley.
Bringing with him years of experience, he always has been and still
is a sincere, earnest and capable worker for the upbuilding of this
valley.
That Mr. Noble is an honest, upright, capable business man, who
understands, appreciates and sympathizes with the farmer and his
needs, is apparent to all who know him. To those who do not know
him his record is open to inspection. Successively the local man
ager for the Goodrich-Call Lumber Company, cashier of the Gold
en Valley Bank, president of the First National Bank and mayor of
Beach, he is now engaged, in the insurance business and is also the
secretary and treasurer of the farmers' elevator company. As an
officer of this farmers' institution, however, he has done some of
his best work—always active, alert and faithful to the interests of
the farmer.
The only respect in which Mr. Noble has not been so active is in
his campaign for the office of county treasurer. However, he feels
that the majority of the voters know enough of his past to judge
how the office of county lrc iM:ier will be manage if lie loc». d.
If the decision is left to the hosts of farmers and others with who in
he has been identified and know him best, there will be no ques
tion but that he will be the next county treasurer. And that he is
very eminently qualified for the office goes without saying.
Mr. Noble is making his campaign strictly upon his qualifications
for the office. He feels that the office of county treasurer is so im
portant to the community that only this consideration should
govern.
If elected Mr. Noble will give the office his exclusive and personal
attention.

The Power's to go
Out of Business
Announcement Made This Week,
and Big $30,000 Stock Will
be Placed on Sale.
Wednesday.
People throughout the Golden
Valley generally will regret ex
ceedingly that the popular Power's
clothing store and haberdashery
will soon be numbered among
the traditions of Beach. T. J.
Power, the manager of the Beach
store made the definite announce
ment this week to the Chronicle
I hat their immense and complete
•$30,000 stock pf merchandise will
be placed before the public for
disposition at a sale which starts
next Wednesday, June 21. Mr.
Power's future plans have not
been announced.
For eight years The Power's
have been a synonym: for quality
and reasonable prices, and their
annual sales have been events
which have drawn people from
all over the Golden Valley who
had an eye to the opportunities
offered at their clearing sales.
The-present sale, we are assured
l»y Mr. Power, will surpass in
low prices and output anything
before offered in Beach. Business
conditions have prompted The
Power's in making this decision.
A large price announcement
will appear in the Chronicle next
Sweek, to which we inviie the at
tention of our readers. In order
to dispose of the stock quickly,
prices have been cut mercilessly
and the public is assured of the
biggest bargain opportunity
which has occurred in the city's
history.
Farmers Favor
A County Agent
A feature of the big farmers
meeting which occurred here
Tuesday at the opera house was
the unanimity with which/ the
farmers went on record is favor
ing a county agent for Golden Val
ley 'county. Messrs. McCarthy,
Hayward and Reeve, the commit
tee appointed by the Chamber of
Commerce to convene and pre
sent the proposition before the
meeting, met with splendid en
couragement, and it is likely that
the appointment of a county
agent will be made by the county
commissioners at an early date.
This is a needed measure, and one
:n
which the farmers themselves,
by their attitude Tuesday, are
heartily in favor. A number of
prominent farmers took the floor
in behalf of the measure, and a
unanimous vote was given,
The expense of such an office
would amount to between $2500
and $2800, salary and traveling
expenses of the agent. The sum
would be raised by a direct tax
in which residents, non-residents
and the business men of the
county would contribute. In or
der to correct an erroneous im
pression which prevails in a few
case's, we wish to state that such
a tax wouuld amount to but from
fifteen to twenty cents per year
added taxes in each case over the
preceding year. This is a neg
ligible sum when considering the
vast good which would accrue by
the appointment of an agent.
The measure was first consid
ered informally by the Chamher
of Commeri-e at the suggestion
of a number of Golden Valley
farmers, and the meeting Tuesday
offered the committee a splendid
opportunity for presenting the
matter before a large body of
prominent farmers. The county
commissioners by their power
could have authorized the office
without consultation, but prefer
ed to govern any action they
might take by the sentiment of
those who would be benefitted
thereby. As a result, it is more
than probable that the office will
be authorized at an early meet
ing.
Since the above written, we
learn that the subject was dis
cussed at a big meeting which oc
curred a few days ago at Sen
tinel Butte, J.. A. Kitchen, former
superintendent of schools and a
prominent agriculturists, present
ing the matter. In this case, also,
it met with hearty accord.
GOLLMAR BROS.' CIRCUS
SHOW IN BEACH JULY 7.
Gollnyir Bros' celebrated three
ring circus will show in Beach
July 7. News of this event was
given by Advance Agent G. E.
Robinson, who was here and con
fered with city officials yesterday
and was issued a .license. It is
announced that two performances
will be given in the afternoon on
the Hunter property on the north
side. They make a jump from
Miles City to Beach, and show at
Dickinson the following day.
This will he a welcome event

years ago as advertised being pre
'vented by high water, and result

six thousand people, one of the
largest crowds Beach has ever
known.
Gollmiar Bros, are cousins to
the Ringlings, and will run their
show on the same honest busi
ness principles as the "largest
show in the world." A mammoth
street parade will occur at 10:30
in the forenoon.
Beach is recognized as one of
the best circus towns on the itin
erary, and in view of the fact that
their non-appearance here was
disappointment to thousands of
people, Mr. Robinson stated that
Go! I mars would tage special
pains to give Beach the very best
attraction the state has known.

Among the largest and most
enthusiastic meetings ever held
in Beach occurred at the opera
house Tuesday morning and af
ternoon when the stockholders of
the Farmers' Co-operative Grain
company held their annual meet'
ing. The morning was given ov
er to a session of stockholders
and officials only, at which mat

mentary on the ability of the re
tiring officials and Manager Win.
Zimmerman and assistant. Geo.
McGregor. The report of the
secretary-treasurer showed a to
be-declared dividend of 317,000
for the fiscal year May 1, 1915, to
May 1, 1916, on a capitalization
of $25,000, a remarkable showing
«n the history of state co-operat
ive movements, and an eloquent
argument for co-operative move
ments.

synopsis of the points covered by
the speaker:
IDEALS OF LIFE.
The men and women whose
names the world will not will
ingly let die are those wiio find
in other's good their greatest,
chiefest joy.
The names of self-seekers,
sclf-gratifiers die out. Selfish
ness never has imbibed life
from the principle of immoral
ity-
The men and women who
come up to the height of a
great choice—their names be
come the echo, ever sounding
down throughout the ages, of
the sacrifices they once made
for others.
Life is the time for choosing
and in its earlier period we are
consciously or unconsciously
choosing the things that make
life's destiny. Parents and
teachers know full well the ad
vantages to the life that has
