Rlaht of Inoorporatlon to Devolop
Powor on Middlebury Rlver.
Tlio Public Sorvlco Commlsson hna
doclded togrnnt tlio potltlon of Charlea
II. ThompHon to boallowed to organlzo
a corporatlon to bulld a dam on tlio
Middlebury rlvor and aoll tlio powor to
Barre. ButMr. Thompnon muat flrat
ahow hla funda and do aovoral othor
thinga. Tho Commlaalon'a roport la
as followa:-
At tho hoarlng, tho petitionera Intro
duced ovidonco that thoy had ncquired
certain land or righta to land clther In
foo or by optlon on tho Middlebury river
and that tho propoacd corporatlon, If
eatabliahed, propoaed to dovelop a
hydro.olectric plant at a point called
"Tho Gorgo" on aaid Rlvor and to dia
tributo tho electricity gonerntcd theru
from to tho public for power and mo
chanlcal purposoa only in tho towns of
Middlebury, Ripton, Lincoln, Hancock,
and Granville, in tho County of Addison;
Warren, Roxbury, Northfield, Berlin,
Barre Town, Barre City, and Mont
pelier, in tho County of Washington,
and Williamstown in tho County of
Orange, nnd also for lighting purposea
in the towna of Ripton, Hancock, Lin
coln, Warren, Itoxbury, Berlin and tho
village of Eaat Middlebury.
The potitioners introduced ovidenco
concerning a particulnr plan of dovelop
mont which would bo adopted by said
corporation and alao produced engineer
ing data which tcndcd to ahow that aaid
particular plan of development waa
commercially feasible.
The estato of Joaeph Battell, which'
appcared in opposition to tho potition,
claimed that tho propoaed plan of de
velopment if carried out, would destroy
the aenic beauty of Middlebury Gorge;
would render necessary n diversion of
the highway leading'to Bread Loaf Inn,
a hotel owned by said eatate, and would
require tho taking of a largo amount
of land now owned by the said eatate.
The claim was also made by said estate
that the land owned by it which would
have to be taken to carry out said plan
of development has already been de
voted to a public uao by the terma of
the will of the late Joseph Battell and
consequently could not be taken by the
exerciae of any right of eminentdomain
by said proposed corporation.
Therc wns conaiderable dispute in the
evidence as to tho relative real estate
holdings of the Battell estate and of the
petitionera. In regard to the conten
tions of said estate, we find that the
proposed plan of development, if carried
out, would not injure or impede access
by highway to the Bread Loaf Inn, aa
the proposed plan contemplates the
building of a new highway in place of
the present highway which would be
better than said present highway in
grade and construction und would ren
der the Inn equally accessible. While
the Commiasion has a due appreciation
of the scenic beauties of tho State, we
do not feel that such a consideration
should be paramount in deciding a ques
tion concerning an industrial develop
ment of the State of Vermont through
the medium 6f its water powers. In
this case, we believe that the advantage
of some form of hydro-electric develop
on the Middlebury River will outweigh
the possible impairment of the scenic
beauty of the River which might result
therefrom. In regard to the possibility
of land being taken from the estate of
Joseph Battell by condemnation pro
ceedings by the proposed corporation
and in regard to the legnl right of the
corporation so to do, the Commission is.
of the opinion that the present proceed
ing is not the one in which to decide
theae questions. The proposed cor
poration would have no right to take any
of the lands of said estate unless by con
demnation proceedings in which the
statutory requirements must be shown
and even then could not take any land
if the same had been previously devoted
to a public use.
To undertake to decide those ques
tions in the present proceeding would be
going entirely beyond the scopc which
we attribute to this petition. We will
consider these questions when, if ever,
they are raised before the Commission
directly in a proceeding between the
corporation and the estate of Joaeph
Battell.
Tho Montpelier & Barre Light &
Power Company appeared in opposition
to the petition, claiming that it is an
established public service corporation
supplying Northfield, Berlin, Barre
Town, Barre City, Montpelier and Wil
liamstown with electric energy for
lighting and power purposes; that it
wns adequately supplying all the elec
trical energy demanded by said com
munities for all purposes; that if the
proposed corporation be established, its
plan of development carried out, and
the electric energy therefrom dis
tributed insaid communities, a com
petitive situation would be created which
