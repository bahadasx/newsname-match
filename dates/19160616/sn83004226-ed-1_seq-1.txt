St. Louis, June 14. The Democratic
National Convention at lis first Kesjion
today, heard the keynote of American
!nii and peace, preparedness and pros
perity sounded by former Governor
tllynn, of New York, a temporary
clialrman and with a high pitch of en
thuslaam registered by demonstration
after demonstration It approval of
ITesident Wilson' peaceful conduct of
foreign affair. ;
The convention, which had gotten
under way with such perfunctory d-m
onatratlon as marks national gather
ings of the kind. Boon stirred itself in
to roaring cheers as Chairman Glynn
cited historic parallels to show" that
other president. Including Republican
had adjusted threatening foreign situ
ation without resort to war,
"The policy of the administration.'
he declared, "has been Just as Amer
ican as the American flax itself.''
As he went down the list of presi
dents recounting their action to avoid
war, the delegates caught the spirit of
hi argument and as he referred to each
particular president some delegate
would call, "What did he do?"
"He settled the trouble by negotia
tion." was (the reply which Glynn In
variably returned and the convention
would roar Its approval. .
Bill Bryan Weep.
William J. Bryan, a newspaper rep
resentative in the press stand, wept
with emotion as Glynn pictured the
victories of ence but he laughed with
the crowd When fc. Texas delegate In
terrupting Glynn leaped to his chair
and cried: "And don't forget that pol
io is satisfactory to William Jennings
Bryan."
Aside from a sixteen minute demon
stration which began when Chairman
Glynn predicted President Wilson's re
election, Glynn's speech was sprinkled
with demonstrations which he found It
difficult to stem so he could go on. It
was plain that the telling ixiints on the
delegates were the" recital of Presi
dent Wilson's efforts to keep the coun
try at peace.
"Th:. policy," he said, "may not sat
isfy the fire-eater and the swash buck
ler. Hut it does satisfy the mothers of
the land at whose hearth and fireside
no Jinrol'tlc was has placed an empty
chair. It does satisfy the daughters of
this land from whom bluster and brag
have sent no loving brother to the dis
solution of the grave. It does satisfy
'he fathers of this land and t,he sons of
this land who will fight for our flag and
die for our flag when reason primes the
rifle: when honor draws the sword and
when justice breathes a blessing on the
standard they uphold." :
The last of the words were drowned
out In a roar of applause that swept
the Coliseum. -
"Reiieat it," cried the delegates, "Re
peat it."
"All light, be quiet and I'll repeat
It," responded Glynn and he did to ap
plause and cheering.
Faced Crucial Problems.
No other president since the Civil
war, Glynn said, had faced such crucial
problems, had displayed a grasp of
statesmanship more, profound.
"Whether the course the country has
pursued during this crucial period. Is
break and whether the principles that
have been asserted as our national pol
icy shall be endorsed or withdrawn,"
Glynn told the convention, was the
paramount question for the voters to
decide.
"No leaser Issue must close," said he.
"No unrelated problems must confuse
it.".."

GOV. HATFIELD ASSAULTS
ISAAC T. MANN AT CHICAGO.
At the Republican National' conven
tion at Chicago last week .Chairman
Harding asked the several states to an
nounce the selection of members of the
National Committee. The West Vir
ginia delegation had agreed to make a
nomination at 8 o'clock to-night, but
when the other state were reporting
their selection Governor Henry D.
Hatfield . attempted to poll the West
Vjrrihia delegation.
Isaac T. Mann, liramwell coal opera
tor, who yesterday was chosen Chair
man, remonstrated with the Governor,
advising him that he was Chairman of
the delegation and that an agreement
was made to select the member of the
National Committee to-night- The ire
of the Governor was aroused by Mann
and he referred to the habitat of Chair
man Mann as belnp McDowell county,
"where you see to steal elections."
Chairman Mann retorted that "there
are other thieves in McDowell county,"
and the Governor asked if his remarks
were intended to convey the Impression
that he was a thief.
Mann stated that he did not. The mo
ment chairman Harding announced
the adjournment of the convention Hat
field walked over to the Chairman of
the delegation and repeated his Inquiry
and again Mann replied that he had not
made a personal reference to the Gov
ernor.. At the same moment the Governor
struck at the millionaire coal opera-
tor. The blow was a glancing one and
caught the Chairman of the delegation
on the nose, bringing the claret freely.
Governor Hatfield Immediately rushed
from the Coliseum, while the other
members of the delegation restrained
and remained with Chairman Mann,
who was not seriously hurt and but lit
lie perturbed by the occurrence.
Mann and Governor Hatfield form
erly were close personal frfvnds before
the election of the physician to the
Governorship. They became estrang
ed lu 1913, w hen Mann sought the nom
ination for United States Senator, and
Hatleid failed to give him his support.
Tbelr personal hostility was promoted
In the recent primasy contest when
Mann supported Abe Lilly for the gov
ernorship, and the Governor threw his
influence to Judge Ira Robinson.

B. $ 0- RAILROAD TO
BUILD ON LEFT BEAVER.
LINE FROM C. & O. RAILROAD. TO
WEEKSBURY A CER
TAINTY. '
Baltimore, Md., June 13. A new rall-f
road Is to be constructed In Eastern
Kentucky In the Interest of the Balti
more and Ohio Railmad, which will tap
the properties of the Elk horn Coal Cor
poratlon, which some months ago took
over the Elkhorn Mining and the Elk
horn Fuel Companies on the left fork
of Beaver creek, in Kentucky, and also
the coal lands of the Milwaukee Gas
and Cuke Company in the same terri
tory. .-..' .
The road Is to be known as the Long
Fork railroad, and will be approximate
ly 30 miles in length. When put in oper
ation It will connect with the Chesa
peake and Ohio. Its completion will
mean that the Baltimore and Ohio will
secure the routing of coal shipments to
the north and west of large acreage of
coal of an excellent quality, which is
in great demand for by-product pur
poses. The Sandy Valley and Elkhorn Rail
road was originally constructed by the
Consolidated Coal Company In order to
serve its coal properties in the Elkhorn
Valley of Kentucky.
. , - Weeksbury.
This is a new town planned and
started possibly two year ago and then
allowed to lag because of the lack of
transportation facilities. It is on the
left fork of Beaver creek In Floyd -co,
where are found large deposits of fine
coal. Contracts have been let recently
for the erection of one hundred dwell
ing houses and it is reported that as
many more will be built this season.
This promises to be one of the most
prosperous of the several mining towns
of the Big Sandy territory.
It is reported that the contract for
building the B. & O. line referred to
above will be let very soon. The sur
veys were completed quite a while ago.

WEST VIRGINIA PROGRESSIVES.
Chicago, June 8.- Unless an agree
ment is reached here between the Re
publicans and Progressives on the na
tional ticket there will be Bull Moose
tickets in West Virginia, Progressive
National Committeeman. He said:
The light vote cast in the West Vir
ginia primary Tuesday, when not more
than 80.000 votes were cast for the Re
publican candidates, was due to the ac
tivity of the lYogressives, who advised
the voters claiming allegiance to that
party to remain out of the primary.
The fact that 60,000 Republican and
Progressive voters refused to partici
pate proved conclusively that we will
have but little trouble in securing the
required number of petitions to place a
ticket In the field." '
