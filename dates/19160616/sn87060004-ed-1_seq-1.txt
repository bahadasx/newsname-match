THOSE THATHAVrZrGETwesTON
OUR DAVE
Delivers Splendid Address
in House of Rep-,
resentatives I
Representative D. H.Kipchloe
of Madisonville, delivered Ji mas
terly oration in the House of
Representatives upon Jefferson
Dpvis and the Southern Confed
eracy upon the one hundred" and
eighth birthday of theiiramortal
President of the Confederacy.
Mr. Kincheloe, beginning with
statistical and historical data,
warmed up through gradations
of olrqnenco into a fervid and
beautiful climax that brought
down the House'. His tributes
to Lincoln, the President of the
United States, and Davis, Presi
dent of the Confederacy, syncoro
niously, both Kentuckiane, were
equally effective. The young
Kentuckian, resorant of voice,
graceful and expressive in ges
tures, with a sensitive, intillect
nal face, not unsnggestive of the
old world countenances of Patric
Henry, and Henry Olay, showed
himself the loyal, son of a "John
ny Rsb" in his enthusiastic ut
terances. His address ended
with the quoting of the beautiful
patriotic inscription upon the
Confederate monument at Ar
lington. Jefferson Davis was
born in Mr. Kincheloo's district,
(Washington correspondent
Sunday's Courier Journal, June,
11, 1910.)

CALOMEL SALIVATES
AND MAKES YOU SICK
Acts Like Dynamite on a
Sluggish Liver and You
Lose a Day's Work.
There's no reason why a per
son should take sickening, sali
vating calomel when 50 cents
buys a large bottle of Dodson's
Liver Tone a perfect substitute
for calomel.
It is a, pleasant vegetable liquid
which will start your liver just
as snrely as calomel, but it does
make you sick and can not saliv
ate.
Ohildren and grown folks can
take Dodson's Liver Tone be
cause it is perfectly harmless.
Calomel is a dangerous drug.
It is mercury and attacks yonr
bonos. Take a dose of nasty
calomel today and yon will feel
weak, sick and nauseated to
morrow. Dcn'fc lose a day's
work. Take a spoonful of Dod
son's Liver Tone instead and you
will wake up feeling great, No
moro biliousness constipatiou,
sluggishness, headache, coated
tongue or sonr stomach. Your
druggist says if you don't find
Dodson's Liver Tone acts better
than horrible calomel your
money is waiting for you.

I will not be responsible for any
debt made by Mabel Phillips and
