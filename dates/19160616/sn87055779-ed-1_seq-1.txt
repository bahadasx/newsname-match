IXTr.lt NATION A I. ISOLATIONS
The democratic administration lias
throughout the present war scrupu
lously and successfully hebl to the
old paths of neutrality and to the
peaceful pursuit of the legitimate
objects of our national life which
statesmen of all parties and creeds
have prescribed for themselves in
America since the beginning of our
history. liut the cireumsianees of
the last two years have revealed nec
essities of international action which
no former generation can have fore
seen. We hold that it is the duty of
the United States to use its power,
not only to make itself safe at home,
but alsi to make secure its just in
terests throughout the world, and.
both for this end and in the inter
est of humanity, to assist the world
in securing settlel peace and jus
tice. We believe that every people
has the rip lit to choose the sover
eignty under which it shall live;
that the small states of the world
have a right to enjoy from other na
tions the same respect for their sov
ereignty ami for their territorial in
tegrity that great and powerful na
tins expect and insist upon; and
that the world has a right to he free
from every disturbance of its peace
'that has its origin in aggression or
disregard of the rights of peoples
and nations; and we believe that the
time has come when it is the duty of
the I'nited .states to juin with other
nations of the world in any feasible
a.-sociation lhat will effectively serve
those principles to maintain inviolate
the complete security of the highway
ol' the seas :'or the common and un
hindered use of all nations.
The present administration has
consistently sought t. act upon and
realize in its conduct of the foreign
affairs of tie nation the principle
that should be the object of any as
sociation of the nations formed to
secure the peace of the world and
the maintenance of national and in
dividual rights. It has followed the
highest American traditions; it has
preferred respect for the fundamen
tal rights of smaller states even to
property interests and has secured
the friendship of the people of these
states for the Unitel states by refus
ing to make a mere material interest
ar. excuse for the assertion of our
superior pover against the dignity
of their sovereign independence-. It
has regarded the lives of its citizens
and the claims of humanity as of
greater moment than material
rights, and pc-aj-e as the best basis
for the just settlement of commer
cial claims. It has made the honor
and ideals of the Fnited States its
standard alike in negotiation and
a ction.
