It Just happened that day that every
thing had been going to the ever
lasting bowwow, as Hampden himself
etpt-eisoti ft ttifeibgti his flenched
teeth. The New Hoti wires were de
layed on account of the Btortil bd
even on the local line it was almost
impossible to get a clear, connected
message through. ,
"Central!" he called. "ContraV
What'a the matter with this wire,
anyhow? 1 been hanging on to the
end of the line tor fla h'mf trying to1
get a number."
"Wlrea down below Grand Indian,"
she answered pleasantly. "Kingston
doea not reipdnd."
Hampden muttered something which
sent both places hurtling merrily after
tlodom and Gomorrah's fate, and called
again. ;
' I'Look here. Vre got to catch New
York tonight before six. It's more
tb"i mf ItirM thst hanjrs on it. There's
War No Peril to Prosper
ity. "Internaticnal difficulties will
not materially harm tho pros
perous condition in this region,"
says J. P. Down( preaideut of
the New England National
Bank, in an interview in the
Kansas City.Star. "If relations
dre broken oft" with Uermany
there will be ho Idirncdiate ef
fect upon commercial lines in
thia part of the country.'- It will
meati fil.lij'ly " thai" the rtation
will pi-epare for eventualities.
In the meantime prosperiiy will
continue." .
Continuing, Mr. Downs said:
"In all the thirty-four years
I have lived in Kansas City the
business 'prospects never were
so blight-.' We are prosperous
now, but all signs point to much
greater prosperity,
"Un top of two years of great
crops we will havr piling in on
us within sixty days, so experts
say, a ld; million bushel wheat
crop, And last year's crop still
is being marketed. It is a con
dition without precedent for
this region.
"On top of that, the grass is
Arte, the stock Came through
the winter in flne sh'ape and
they have plenty to feed on.
Oil in great quantities is being
marketed at. high ' prices. All
lines of business are in -a sound
financial condition.
"High prices are being com
manded for all commodities. It
means continued prosperity."
Prosperity, wages, commerce,
industrial expansion, internat
ional law all are aboard the
Democratic band wagon, which
bears the label "America first,
last and always " Seating ca
pacity is ample for Republicans.
In 20 months of the nesv Dem
ocratic tariff, ending March 31,
1916, the balance of trade in
favor of the United States in its
world commerce exceeds $2,93C,-
000,000, as compared with less
than half that, or l,402,0OO,000
durin the last 20 months of the
Republican tariff. Who wants
to abolish this career of prosper
ity by a return to old conditions?
a feliow down fhre who may commit
suicide tonight If be doesn't get my
word that things are all right, see? I
got a letter hello, hello! iKm't cut
me off, please" ,
' I'm listening," said Central. ;
"He thinks he was ruined in ft
plunge of stOCh this morning, and I've
got over half of hf oasil safe, see?
Pulled It out with my own on yester
day's sales. My wife's sick; PP here,'
and I had to come. He thinks I got,
cold foet and ran away. Now, wtf'ya
?ot to gflt word to him at once tha&
he's all right. You and I have got to
put this through or there's going to be
one dead boy down there by morning.
Take a message, can you, and get it
through by telegraph anywhere along
tl!f line?" ,
"Hold the wire". I'll see," said Cen-.
tral.
Hampden held it, X.r0wninK ont ,l
te trees, crystal white 'Wjt.h Ice and
snow.
"Hello, jus( fl minute, please," she
called back. "I think w can get X
through by way of NewbuTgii, New
burgh seems to respond."
Newburgh did respond. The wires
that way were all up. When the con
nection was made, his voice sounded
husky to him as he got tbe office and
asked for Ted. i
"Why, he's Just left, sir," the boy
n't the switch answered. "Maybe 1 ai
catch him In the hall." There was
pause and something seemed to break
before Hampden's eyes Hke a great i
noiseless skyrocket. His brain grew !
numb except for the pain through hls.j
shoulder and he slipped limply to the.
floor. . '
Back In New York, Ted turned
moodily from the elevators and fol
lowed the boy to the phone booth. His
head throbbed with pain. He hated '
New York, Hampden, fate, everything-,:
All he wanted was to get out of It.'
Then the girl at the end of the wire
held him. Her voice was beautiful,
Swuet, cheery, most of all full of hu
man iiiterest, : --
"Helks is ttifsi Mr- Curtis This Is
Central at Grand Indian, Long dis
tance reports Mr. Hampden who waa
calling you falls to respond. I have
his message. Ready?"
"Ready," answered Ted eagerly. .
"Ills wife is sick. That is why he'
was called here suddenly. Wishes me
to state that he took your money out
dt the market yesterday with hi
own with profit on sales. Over half
safe. Come to Grand Indian, New
York, at once. Signed, Hatopden," l
Ilt'll IUC Uifeiil wan. uin
Grand Indian; a tall figure in a storm
ulster swung Off and into the lfttw
station. He made straight for the
desk, but the ticket agent satd the
telegraph room was upstairs.
"She lives there," he added. "Mis
Hewitt. Just knock on the door. She'
up till twelve."
Ted took the narrow stairs In three
steps and rapped on the door quickly.'
He had made up all sorts of speeches
on the way to this girl who had given
him the word of good cheer, but when
the door opened and he saw her stand-'
lng there, all he could do was to reach
out his hand and say: '
"I'm Curtis, Ted Curtis. I wanted
to thank you for hauling me up bere.'
How's Mr. Hampden?"
"Better." She smiled up at him In
the friendliest way. Her white sweat
er was buttoned close to her chin,
and her hair was rumpled as If she
had been sleeping, but her eyes wer N
bright and happy as she looked at him,'
"sizing him up," as Ted himself would
have expressed it. "H-'must have
had some sort of a shock following
nervous strain, the doctor said. They
haven't told his wile yet. They're
both coming out of it all right. I
called up twice after you left New
York to make sure. You seer he had
already given his message when he
fell, so all I had to do was push It
through and get you. Only I did put
In for you to come at once."
All she had to do. Ted simply
stared at her. Did ahe know Just
what a fool he had been, Just the sort
of a quitter it was that wrote the let
ter up to Hampden, Just how it had
been her call at the end of the wire
that had pulled him Dack to sanity
and love of life, the realization that
up there 1 1 the mountains somewhere
there was a girl vlth a voice like that
who could make New York look like
thirty cents in the big reckoning.
"I'm going right up to the house
now," he said. "I'll get the atatloa
hack to pull me through somehow, but
I'm coming back to see you." .
