Feels Enthusiasm of
Recites Diplo
St. Louis, June 14.?The Democratic
national convention at its first session,
today heard the keynote of
Americanism and peace, preparedness
and prosperity sounded by Former
Gov. Glynn of New York as temporary
chairman, and, with a high
pitch of enthusiasm, its approval of
President Wilson's peaceful conduct
of foreign affairs.
The convention, which had got under
way with such perfunctory demonstrations
as mark every gathering of
the kind, soon stirred itself into roaring
cheers as Chairman Glynn cited
historic parallels to show that other
presidents, including Republicans, had
adjusted threatening foreign situation
wtihout resort to war.
"The policy of the administration,"
hq declared, "has been just as Ameri~
r can as the American flag itself."
As he went down the list of presidents
recounting their actions to
avoidtaar the -delegates caueht the
at[on," Was the reply which Glynn
invariably returned and the convention
would roar Its approval.
St. Louis, June 14.?With the assertion
that no president since the
War of Secession had had so crucial
problems to solve; and no president
has displayed a grasp more sure, a
statesmanship more profound as President
Wilson, Martin H. Glynn, former
governor of New York, opened the
Democratic national convention here
today. Declaring that "Americanism
and peace, preparedness and prosperity"
are the issues upon which the
Democratic party stands, and the
heart of Democracy swells with pride
that is more than a pride of party,
as i't hails the man who has asserted
this Americanism, assured this peace,
advocated this preparedness and produced
this prosperity," he predicted
the reelection of President Wilson.
Taking up foreign relations that has
been called into emphatic prominence
by the world-wide war the speaker
fKof i wCk Kotro anfnriwl fKio
hall as Democrats, we shall deliberate
as Americans."
The policy of neutrality, he argued
is as truly American as the American
flag. For two hundred years neutrality
was a theory; America made it a
fact. "It took Washington and his
successors 80 years of endless negotiation
to win recognition of American
neutrality. And this 80 years of
struggle wove the doctrine of neutrality
so closely into the warp and
woof of our national life that to tear
it out now would unravel the very
threads of our existence." By the
records of history Mr. Glynn maintained
that if Washington and Lincoln
were right, President Wilson is
right. The neutrality that President
Wilson stands for today was advocated
by Washington, by Hamilton, by
Jefferson and by Lincoln.
Their Own Precedent*.
By citing precedents Mr. Glynn
justified and defended the course of
the president in the Lusitania and
similar incidents. "In the face of this
record," he asked, "do Republicans
realize that when they arraign the
policy of the president of the United
States today they arraign the policy
of Harrison, of Blaine, of Lincoln and
Grant? For the pleasure of criticising
a Democratic president, are
til av urtlllncr fA rno/l anf of f Ha Ra_
publican party the greatest men the
Republican paryt ever had? Are they
willing to say that the Republican
party of today condemns what Hamilton
did in Revolutionary days, what
Lincoln did in Civil war days and
I what Grant and Blaine and Harrison
I did but yesterday?
\ "In his policy of peaceful negotia\
tfons today the president of the Unit\
od States follows the example set
A him by the greatest presidents which

Mr. Glynn impressed on his hear- j
ers that it was the business of this l
convention "representing every sec- str?
tion of the United States, speaking p
for every racial strain in America, p
to send forth a message to all the o
world that will leave no room for p

Good for Business. S
The laws restraining big business and
from stifling competition, the trades p
commission act, the movement to fos- Sch
ter expansion of American trade, the i
close union of economic, commercial cha
and financial interests between the
United States and the nations of B
South America are shown to be legislation
of the widest benefit. The Urv- C

American congresses have enacted. en '

speaker's opening discussion. c^?
In asking for an indorsement of cari
ithe president's peace policy Mr. Glynn 8we
said: han
\ Keeps Flame at Bay.
"Fortwo years the world has been Mat
afire; the civilization that we know
k? k A. 1 ' 1 ' *? ?i
uao uccu turn uy vne mi^nuest Struggle
in its history. Sparks from Eu- f?8*
rope's conflagration have blazed in our tistl
own skies, echoes of her strife have "kb
sounded at our very doors. That fire Kue
still burns, that struggle still contin- R?s
ues, but thus far the United States sal?
has held the flame at bay; thus far *un
it has saved its people from partici- a^
pation in the conflict.
"What the people of the United
States must determine through their ^
suffrage is whether the course the
country has pursued through this ^Qn
crucial period is to be continued) q
whether the principles that have been
asserted as our national policy shall
be indorsed or withdrawn.
"This is the paramount issue. No fln(j
lesser issue must cloud it, no unrelated
problems must confuse it." jum
In declaring that the policy of neu- j
trality is as American as the Ameri- mfir
can flag, Mr. Glynn asserted that:
"The president of the United States
stands today where stood the men
who made America and who saved T
America. He stands where John .
Adams stood, when he told King J?
George that America was the land he '^e(
loved and that peace was her ?5
grandeur and her welfare. He stands 8
where Gen. Grant stood when he said 0881
there never was a war that could not wa8
have been settled better some other 0
way, and he has shown his willingness
to try the way of peace before he
seeks the paths of war. He stands
where George Washington stood when
he prayed that t^is country would *Tor
neved unsheath the sword except in '
self-defense so long as justice and our .
essential rights could be presented tl0n
without it. rR
"If Washington was right, if Jefferson
was right, if Hamilton was
right, if Lincoln was right, then the M
president of the United States is right c^ai
today; if the Republican leaders are Met
.right then Lincoln was wrong and ,'or^
Jefferson was wrong and Hamilton a* '
was wrong and Washington was

Officers.
The Union Chamber of Commerce
;ld its annual meeting Monday eveng.

matters, claimed the attenr?n

R. P. Morgan, 1st vice president.

The seven directors to be elected ti

loice by ballot: si
O. F. Bennett, H. K. Drew, Dr. R. n

ig. These were the three-year men, .
id have another year to serve. These V.1
?ht, with the seven chosen Monday
eping, make up the 15 members of ei
e board of directors.
One of the very important matters
ought up before the Monday night y!
eating was that of improving the !
ibHc Highway from Union to Jones- ai
ll&nd on to the Spartanburg coun- tu
wof r This piece of road is notoriISM
one of the worst in the county w
d has bean particularly bad for the
at^wo years. When the Appalach- ,l*
IV Highway wis scheduled to go
ro^gh Union to West and Glenn
M a promise from Col. Watson re
effort to improve the
MBp*ont?^Hvo Jonesvilie and on
^grttU^^Hh would nnmo that
80-foot road bed. Union, through
e secretary of the Chamber of Comerce,
contributed $500.00 to the road W1
. go'via West and Glenn Springs,
it had nothing to do with locating it m
ere. At that time it was a ques>n
of Union via West and Glenr c^
>rings to Spartanburg or via Latins
to Spartanburg via Glenn of
irings. The West Springs and
enn Springs committee, through to
ei'r public spirit, were the chief
;ents in bringing the road 'iheir way. g
eat enthusiasm was manifested by
th these sections, and each of them
ntributed liberally to the enterprise.
)w comes an opportunity for Joneslle
and for the rural communities m
tween Union and that point and be- m
reen Jonesville and Spartanburg, fo
nion and Jonesville, the two towns m
)st vitally concerned, will be urged a
make public subscription to the
nd to carry out this building proam.
The commissioner of Union
wnship and of Jonesville township
11 also be asked to cooperate. And Pr
e land owners along the road way to
11 be asked to contribute. It is
ked that each land owner pay $1.00 ca
r each acre of land fronting on this Sa
ad and going back one mile. That CI
the land owners would pay about
,280 per mile. It will require about
,500 a mile to build this road. When *a
ilt, the lands along the road will M
hance in value more than enough s'(
compensate the land owner*, and ^a
ey will have opportunity to do con uction
work as the road is build- jj(
? that will put money in their pock- ,
s. It is planned to ask for these
bscriptions in four annual paysnts,
arrangements being made with m
e banks of the county to finance the Q,(
oposition. Qf
West and Glenn Springs were the ea
jective points in the proposed Aplachian
Highway, it was to be "The
ineral Spring Route." Frequently
IvpIatc will pnmp via TTninn a?
nesville and the mountains provided
is way is made as good as the way
i Glenn Springs. ilit
The road, if the plans succeed, will ho
built under the supervision of a G.
mpetent engineer and will be prop- Fc
ly graded, widened to 30 feet and, ith
some cases, relocated. It is up to m<
lion, Jonesville and the land own- an
i along the way now to say wheththis
road is to be built and it will M:
jan very much to them if it is built,
will be a great loss of opportunity

RIOUS CHARGE
Confesses to Entering House
But Claims He Was in Search
of Food?Lodged in Jail by
Prompt Work of Sheriff Fant
and Rural Policemen.
A negro about 27 years of age and
Riving his name as Will Carter, and
claiming to be from Danville, Va.,
was arrested about 1 o'clock Snnibv
afternoon one mile this side of Santuc.
The warrant charge "assault
with intent to rape," and from what
can he learned, is a serious ease. The
home of a white man living several
miles below Union was entered about
3:30 o'clock Sunday morning. He entered
a room occupied by two young
ladies of the family. One of them,
being aroused, plainly saw the negro,
a large, black fellow. He touched her
hand. She aroused her sister. The
negro then fled from the room. He
entered the room in his stocking feet.
This led to his capture, for the traek
left, there having been a light shower,
enabled Sheriff Fant and Rural Policemen
Faucett and McDaniel, who
got to the scene of the trouble by
4:30 o'clock, to track him. This they
did by following on foot the track
made by the negro. They followed
this for several miles, but finally circled
around, getting ahead of the negro.
Coming back to pick up the
track where they last saw it. they met
the negro, and at once recognized him
from the description given of him
by the young ladies. His foot tit exactly

on No. 10 Saturday night and having
left Union after sun up Sunday.
He had eight eggs in his pockat, and
claimed that he had bought them from
a house up the road, but could not
show what house. Arriving at the ,
jail, he owned that he had not
the truth and that he wma-tlif'lmn
who went into the farm house that ,
morning but claimed that he did a ;

The work of Sheriff Fant and Po- .
licemen James Faucett and Thomas
McDaniel was exceptionally good.
They kept at it without food and without
a stop from 4:30 in the morning
to 1 o'clock that afternoon, when the
negro was captured. But for their
prompt and persistent work, he would
never have been caught.
