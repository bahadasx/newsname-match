"Keep Agoing" was the motto of
twenty young ladies and geutleinen who
received their diplomas from the uands
and with the signature of the board ot
education of the Paw Paw nigh school.
The commencement exercises as has been
the custom for several ears back was
held in the skating rink on West Main
street This building to gaze upon the
exterior during the drizzling rain of last
Thursday evening was anything but in
viting, but as the interior was reached,
outside world with clouds and rain was
forgotten. A scene of beauty and music
held us entranced. The cold and barien
walls were hidden from view with ropes
of gold and blue, many hanging baskets,
Bower baskets, ferns and cut flowers.
The most inspiring sight of all was the
colors of "Old (Jlorv" in the back
ground. At promptly eight o'clock the
graduating class marched down the aisle
to the strains of Haaley's Grand March
"National rOmbletn," played as only
Fischer's orchestra could play it. The
class was preceded by the teachers and
the board of education, who also occupied
seats on the elevated platform in front.
The girls of the class looked very "nifty"
in their shirt waist suits of white and
wearing a sport tie of gold and blue, the
class colors The boys were neatly at
tired in business suits and wore ties
"just like the girls". Rev. C. H. Heaton
of the Baptist church asked invocation,
this was followed by another selection
from Fischer. Kirke Harrington as sa
lutaturian of the class in a clear and
forcible manner, told us why so many of
the graduates of our schools through the
country did not "Keep Agoing", and we
are sorr to say thai it is not always the
fault of the graduate, but that father
and mother may in some manner be to
blame for their son or daughter not en
tering the higher seats of learning. His
production contained manygood thoughts
and was well received by the large aud
ience. The history of the class of 1916
fell to the lot of Miss Gertrude Jackson.
Miss Jackson was very much at ease
and handlea the past, present and future
of her classmates in a manner which
seemed satisfactory to all She spoke
distinctly and all were able to hear,
the class poem as announced by the
programs was to have been given b
Miss Edyth Loveland for some reason
not known to us f tiled to mUeri.aize
Charity Cole sureU proved himse.f to h 1
moine prophet and if an he prophesied f r
the future lives of his classmates con s
true, we are sure to hear of some of the
ureat things accomplished by individual
members of the class in tba years to come
His effort was a good one and thotd
that he had spent mucbtimeand thought
on the future of his subjects. Ui M.
Henderson bad the honor of being the
orator of his class and well did he mrit
this honor. His discourse a masterly
one held the closest attention of his
hearers. Arthur Nunn acted in the ca
pacity of an attorney for the class and
drew up a will that disposed of every
thing that they did not want or could
not take with them to the unsuspecting
and helpless juniors. He kept ihe am -ience
in smiles from the beginning to the
end. Miss Clarice Beach as valedictor
ian of the class bade all adieu in behalf
of her classmates. Her production was
clever and greatly eojoyed. Supt. V. K
H ungerford in behalf of the school board
in well chosen words presented the follow
ing graduates with their well earned
sheepskins: Doris Johnson, Edna John
son, Charles Cole, Jr., Arthur Nunn,
Harley Mutchler, Irene Smith, Hannah
Sturtevant, Helen Lewis, Gladys Hood
maker, Clarice Beach, Kay Henderson,
Hdith Loveland, Norman Bailey, Hazel
Colby, Gertrude Jackson, Bonniebell
Showerman. Paul Neale, Azel McNeil,
Kirke Harrington, Ford Sheldon, Clifford
Pugsley and Kathleen Miller. And thus
the class of 1916 passes into the history
of the future.

Saturday, b) way of Carp's fruit trucks
of Hartford for a weeks outing and en
joyment at Douglas park near Sugatuck
They were accompanied by Supt. Hung

Heaton and Smith. As the car passed
through town loaded with its 30 boys
and nil the good things that mother had

their life and that camp life was one to
bring forth the very best of a good time.

will aesiat hit father in the store during
the summer.
Before the roof begins to leak;
It's a pretty good plan to batten
Before the wind begins to shriek;
It's a pretty good plan to build some sheds
To keep things under cover
The plows, cultivators, binders
And one thing and another.
And you'll find it a pretty &ood plan to let
us figure on your Lumber and
Building Material Bills
