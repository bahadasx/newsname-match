olJ his men- attacked a small detach­
ment of the 14th Cavalry, numbering
pbou 80 men, at San Ignacio, 40
miles southeast of Laredo.' His ac­
tion cost him eight men killed, sev­
eral wounded, 42 horses and some
equipment. The American hjss was
three killed and six \vounded.

Major Alonzo Gray late today was
using every man of his little com­
mand in a sweeping search of the
country about Ignacio for "a hot
trail." If it is discovered a third
"punitive expedition" Will enter Mex­

Gen. Funston ajid his staff have little

made no comment on the officers'
statements.
.Raid Was No Surprise
'Although successful in a measure,
the raid was not wholly surprising to

their 100 or more to overpower the
border,guard. They attacked troop,
firing the first shot at the sentry. At

^Secretary Lansing's draft of t%*
note which will refuse Carranza's de­
mand for withdrawal of American
troops from Mexico was laid before
President Wilson today, almost sim­

14th Cavalry at San Ignacio, Texas.

Punitive steps against those re­
sponsible for the new depredation

'will back up the declaration that the
time is not ripe to withdraw -Ameri­

Testimo­

Waukegon, ill., June l"i.—Di". Ralph
Webster, a toxicologist of internation­
al reputation, introduced as a witness
for the state,
in
the trial of Will Or-
pet, the University of Wisconsin stu­
dent. charged
wil.li
the murder of Mar­
ion Lambert,
was
the chief witness
heard today. His testimony tended to
show that I he poison which killed the
Lambert girl
as
taken in liquid form.
The question of whether the poison
was administered in liquid or crystal
form is vital to both sides.
Following the lestiinony of Dr. Web­
ster, the defense brought out a point
said to be unique in the history of
criminal jurisprudence. It was: "Is
the moisture produced by introducing
a foreign body into a warm room suf­
ficient to transform powdered cynaide
of potassium into a solution light
enough to lose its visibility?"
The decision regarding this point
will have a decided bearing on numer­
ous stains which were,found on the
girl's clothes and body and which are
said by the stale's attorney to be from
cynaide of potassium in liquid form.
There was a dramatic moment in
the court room during the afternoon
session, when the hats, shoes and all
the other garments worn by Miss
Lambert on the day of the death
were produced.
In sustaining an objection by the
defense, Judge Donnelly ordered that
only the garments on which the stains
could be found should be admitted as
exhibits.
1
The state attempted to show that
death was caused by the use of the
poison in liquid form, because of the
natural position of the body when
found. Dr. Webster said, however,
that large doses of either the liquid
or crystal form would cause death
without convulsions. Dr. Webster
will resume his testimony tomorrow.
New York, June 15.—Pledges and
promises and predictions continued to
pour into the ears of Charles E.
Hughes today from many Republican
leaders and rank and file of the party.
So many callers crowded into the tem­
porary headquarters that the nominee
virtually had no time for conferences,
but spent nenrly the entire day wel­
coming visitors.
Party plans apparently still are in
abeyance so far as the immediate
work of the campaign is concerned.
Mr. Hughes reiterated today his inten­
tion not to comment on political is­
sued until his official notification of
nomination, which probably will be
subsequent to July 4.

Conference Fails to Adjust Big
Dispute and Men Will Bal­
lot on Issue.
New York, June 15.—More than
550,000 union and non-union workers
of America will vote within a month
on the advisability of calling a gen­
eral strike to enforce their demands
for an eight-hour day and time and
a-half for overtime, as a result of lh?
failure by representatives of the rail­
roads and men to reach a settlement
here.
Hope of adjusting the dispute
through the conference failed when
the railroads submitted a tentative
compromise offer to the men. grant­
ing their demands, but eliminating
the majority of existing double com­
pensation rules. The conference ad
ojurned yesterday to give the ail
road managers an opportunity to dis­
cuss further their stand on this uoint,
but when they met the men today
they not only refused to make a spe­
cific offer covering the compensation
rules, but advised their differences be
submitted either to the 1. C. C. or a
board of arbitration, to operate under
the provisions of the Newlands act.
The men declined both offers anJ the
decision to take a strike vote follow­
ed. The leaders and the 500 dele­
gates of.the Brotherhoods/Of Train­
men, Engineers and Conductors who
attended the conference decided on
the necessity for the strike vote at
secret meeing following the break.

HAVE CAPTURED 150,000
PRISONERS TO DATE
London, June 15.—The twelfth day
of the Russian offensive agflinst the
Austrians and Germans from VoTny
nia to Bukowina shows no signs or
slackening at any joint. All along
the, front *irc9li eflina Jqr^the,
sian troops and the capture of thous­
ands of additional prisoners and of
guns, machine guns and war sup­
plies are claimed by the (Russians.
The number of prisoners now exceeds
150,001).
While semi-official dispatches from
Petrograd give reports that the Rus­
sians have occupied Czernowitch, the
latest Austrian dispatch says the
troops of Rmperor Joseph are maki'rlg
a stand east and north of the city
and have repulsed the Russians.
The French on the siope south of
Le Mort Homme, northwest of Ver­
dun, have captured a German trench.
Only artilery activity is in progress
on the remainder of the French and
Belgian fronts. The Canadians still
are holding the positions captured
from the Germans in the vicinity of
Zillebeke, where there is intermittent
shelling by both sides.
The -fighting on the Austro-Italian
lines in Tyrol seemingly has died
down in violence.
Near Felahie, on the Tigris river,
the Turks have repulsed an attempt
of the British to advance, according
to Constantinople.
TO
DECIDE POIKT
McCurdy Brings Action to De­
termine Commission's
Power.
Another chapter in the election in­
spector squabble was begun yester­
day, when City Attorney McCurdy,
acting in his own capacity and not
as attorney for Bismarck, mandamus
ed the commissioners to appoint in­
spectors according to his interpreta­
tion of the law.
At a recent meeting, the commis­
sion concurred in the appointments
made by the board of county commis­
sioners. McCurdy contends that lost
must be cast and that the winner act
as inspector in his precinct and se­
lect the other five inspectors.
The order to show cause why the
writ should not be issued is return­
able at Washburn next Monday,
wheree Judge Nuessle is holding
court.
iMr. McQurdy states in his petition
that his "interest lies in the fact that
he is a candidate for states attorney
and desires to see the inspectors nam­
ed, according to his conception of the
law.
This probably is one of the first
cases brought up to test the power of
the city commission to name election
inspectors.

man James Inside the coliseum. It
was delivered to him on the platform,
and he isent a special party- to b^fnc
them in.
"Name him! Name him!" caipe
cries from the gallery.
As Judge Westcott closed with a
mention of the name, "Woodrow Wil­
son," the crowd broke into a great
demonstration. Moving picture flash­
lights blazed, and the band played
"The Star iSpangled Banner," while a
huge banner bearing the president's
likeness was unfurled from the roof
of the hall.
Rousing Demonstration.
The delegates began a parade, bear­
ing the state's standard. The crowd
on the floor and balcony rose to its
fdet.
"Dixie" and other melodies by tha
bands evoked fresh burst of cheering.
There was absolutely no attempt to
control the crowd in the coliseum,
while the demonstration was Koine
on. Men and women, wearing various
kinds of badges to which they were
not entitled, overran the platform
?nd press sections at will. The police
made no effort to control the situa­
tion.
The crowd roared and several wo­
men suffragist workers with, golden
umbrellas and yellow sweaters, who
swarmed the platform, held a suffrage
umbrella over the head of Representa­
tive Heflin of Alabama, one ot the
most vigorous "antis" in congress.
He apparently enjoyed the situation.
The band, its repertoire taxed, turn*
ed to such ancient ballads^as "On the
Banks of the Wabash" and "Turkey in
the Straw."
Lasts Forty-Five Minutes.
After the demonstration had been
under way 35 minutes, New York and
some other delegates resumed their
seats. Waving a cane over the rail
at the chairman's, desk, Senator
Hughes renewed the clamor by lead­
ing three cheers for the president.
At 11:30 p. m. but a few delegates
had taken teir seats, apparently ready
to go on,'and at 11:33 Chairman
James sounded the first gavel rap.
The demonstration had lasted 45 mln
utes.
When Judge Westcott. of .New Jer­
