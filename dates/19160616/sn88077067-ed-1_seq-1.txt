Sounds Keynote-Bryan to Stump Country
The renoinination of President Wilson hiu! Vice President
Marshal at St. Louis last night,
enthusiastic unanimity of thu
crushed the hopes of the Republicans, who thought there miyht
be some dissensions that would enable their party 1o again ride
back into iiower in the nation in spite of the tfivuf Hchievemeiits
of the Democratic party in far leuchiiiy ::nd In ut tirittl legislation
and the. safe conduct of the
times since the nioue'iitous days of Abraham Lincoln.
The hopes of the Republicans were further shatti it d when
Bryan came out openly for the
and announced his determination
party's candidates, and administration leaders are jubilant,
knowing the commoner's tfieat hold on the sympaties and aspi
rations of the common people of the country. They forgot
Bryan was a builder and not a destroyer. And they sorrow that
he never fools the people and never makes an ass of himself.
Now for four years more of Wilson and Marshall.
GLYNN SOUNDS THE KEYNOTE
St. Louis, Juno 14.- The Democra
tic National Convention at its first
session toilay heard the keynote of
Aniericani:ini ami peace, prepared
ness and prosperity rounded by for
mer Governor Glynn, of New York,
as temporary Chairman and, with a
high pitch of enthusiasm emphati
cally registered by demonstration al
ter demonstration, its approval of
President Wilson's peaceful conduct
of foreign affairs.
The convention which had gotten
nuder way with Buch perfunctory de
monstration as mark every national
gathering or the kind, soon stirred
itself into roaring cheers as Chair
man Glynn cited historic parallels to
show that other Presidents, includ
ing ltepublieans, had adjusted
threatening foreign situations with
out resort to war.
'The policy of the administration,'
he declared, "has been just as Anier-
a : .. It.,. .IP "
lean as me aiiiim it-un nag n. ,
Makes Crowd Koiu
As he went down the list of Pre
sidents, recounting their action to
avoid war, the delegates caught the
spirit of his argument and as he re
ferred to each particular President
some delegate would call:
"What did he do?"
"He settled the trouble by negoti
ation," was the reply which Glynn
invariably returned and the crowd
would roar its approval.
William J. Uryan ,as a newspaper
correspondent m the press stand,
wept with emotion as Glynn pictured
the victories of peace, but he laghed
with the crowd when a Texas dele
gate, interrupting Glynn, leaped to
his chair and cried, "And don't for
get that policy also is satisfactory to
William Jennings Uryan."
Aside from a sixteen-minute. dem--onstration
which began when Chair
man Glynn predicted President Wil
son's re-election, Glynn's speech was
sprinkled with demonstrations which
found it difficult to (item so he could
go on. It was plain that the telling
points on the delegates were the reci
tal of President Wilson's efforts to
keep the country at peace.
"This policy," he said, "may not
satisfy the fire-eater and the swash
buckler, hut it does satisfy the moth
ers of the land at whose hearth and
fireside no jingoistic was has placed
an empty chair. It does satisfy the
daughters of the land from whom
bluster and brag have sent no loving
brother to the dissolution of the
grave. It does satisfy the fathers of
this hind and the sons of this land,
who will fight for our tag and die for
our flag when reason primes the rifle,
when honor draws the sword and
when Justice breathes a blessing 6n
the standard they behold."
Ilud to Hepeat
The last of the words were drwn
ed out In the roar of applause that
swept the Coliseum.
"Unpeat It," cried the delegates;
"repeat it."
"All right, be quiet and I'll repeat
it," responded Glynn and he did so
to applause and cheering.
No other President since the Civil
War; Glynn told the convention, had
faced such crucical problems, none
had displayed a grasp of statesman
ship more profound.
"Whether the course the country
has pursued during the crucical per
iod is to he continued and whether
the principles that have been assert
ed as our national policy shall be en
dorsed or withdrawn," Glynn told the
convention, was the paramount ques
t'on for the voters to decide.
"No lesser issue must cloud it," he
said. "No unrelated problem must
confuse it."
After hearing the keynote speech,
the convention adjourned until 11
o'clock tomorrow. Committees then
went into session to prepare their
work lor the session.
Today the big Coliseum, holding
about 12,000 people, practically was
filled and despite a constantly rising
temperature it was fairly comfort
able. On their way to the Convention
Hall the delegates passed between

Hie phlegmatic, unemotional menial
attitude that has marked wilh but

Republican National convention to
day nominated Charles W. iluglic:;

Fairbanks tor sice president. It dis
passionately disposed of the hist ef
fort of Theodore Itonsevelt to direct

Tin extinguishment was complete.

I ' I ti 1 1 1 1 i-;i ii candidates be would ac
Cept.
Absolutely no stir was created out
i. de of Ihe Massacbii''el Is delegation,
whore a number of personal friends
of Senator Lodge expressed their sal
i ."faction noisily. Willi the gri'uness
tlb;l lias accompanied their actious,
the rest of Hi" dele"ales remained
silent. K ron i the gallery there was a
cheer now and then, and some guff
aws and hisses too.
it was known before the parade
down Michigan boulevard begun this
morning that Hughes and Fairbanks
had been agreed upon and that their
selection was foreoi daineil.
Farly reports from the (Joinniillec
on Conference brought the intelli
gence that Hie Republicans bad offer
ed as a compromise, Justice Charles
L. Hughes and that Hie Progressives
of a radical type would not accept
him.
There was some amusement over
the offer of the conferees as it was in
their power to present no one else.
Luring the night the opposition to
him had colapsed and his nominal ion
.as assured when the conferees,
tongue in cheek, met the Progress
ives, who knew the sit nation as well
is they did.
As soon as the stage was cleared
for the rehearsal performance, Sen
ator Sinoot reaj the reports as a rep
resentative of the conferees and also
Colonel Roosevelt, handed him by J.
W. Met' rath, secretary to the former
president, who was on the platform.
Sinoot read it and its length of des
cription of the virtues of Senator
Lodge caused a delegate audibly to
say that "the state of Roosevelt is
nominating its candidate.
Massachusetts cheered its Lodge s
name, but only in part. When Sinoot
uinouneed that the I'rogressive con
vention had laid Roosevlet's tele
gram and the Republican recommen
dation of Hughes on Hie table, the
convention booed the execrated Hull
Moose heartily. Calmly, as befitted
tin; scene. Chairman Harding grave
ly discharged the committee and
thanked it for its alleged labors, a
neiTorinaneo that caused more smil
ing.
Itoll Call a Huge l''arce
The roll call was; huge farce.
Fairbanks got. 8GI! votes. Hiram
Johnson, the militant progressive got
one, as did Theodore Jiurton, of Ohio
whose biographer can make note of
Hie fact that he was suported for
both places ointhe ticket. When for

Ohio, moved to make this "election
