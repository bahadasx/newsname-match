Helena, Montana, July 14, 1913.
If every company doing busi
ness in Montana would foliow the
lead of the Western Accident and
Indemnity Company, the State in
a few years would have the best
system of hard surfaced roads in
the world. H. D. Cook, Presi
dent of the Company, has an
nounced that in behalf of the con
cern he would give 20 per cent
of his gross income on Good
Roads day to the state road fund.
Governor Stewart recently issued
a proclamation setting aside June
20th as Good Roads day, in con
formity with a bill introduced by
Senator McCone and passed by
the last legislature. When it is
considered that this enterprising
Company did a $10,000,000 busi
ness last year, some estimate of
what Company is liable to have
to dig up may be had.

WM. McCRAKEN
IS ARRESTED
After Two Years Search Officers
Locate Their Man And Get Him
Landed Behind The Bars Again.
Wm. W. McCraken, alias Bill
White, was lodged in the county
jail at Miles City Wednesday of
this week. Undersheriff Frank
Evans of this county and Stock
Inspector Richerdson of Custer
county had been putting in the
past two weeks near the McCra
ken place on Thompson creek,
in the southwestern part of the
county, in an endeavor to locate
their man who will be remember
ed gave the officers of this county
and northern Wyoming a lively
chase and some tough trouble
about two years ago. Monday
Sheriff Jones made a trip to the
Thompson creek country and
brought back with him Under
sheriff Evans who was called here
by sickness in his family and
during his absence Richardson
located the notorious outlaw and
soon had him safely landed be
hind the bars.
It was about two years ago
that McCraken entertained the
officers in and about his premises,
at times using his gun, but with
poor results. He was arrested at
that time but during the night
escaped and his whereabouts
were unknown until a short time
ago. He is considered a danger
ous man by the officers and no
more chances are to be taken
with him. His hearing will no
doubt come up at the next term
of district court. Undersheriff
Evans, from whom McCraken
made his escape left yesterday
for Miles City to get his man and
will bring him back to this county
at once.
There will be a meeting of the
Democratic Precinct Committee

Committemen are earnestly re
quested to be present; and we
also urge the attendance of others
in their neighborhood who are
interested in the success of the
Democratic party.
Very truly yours,
