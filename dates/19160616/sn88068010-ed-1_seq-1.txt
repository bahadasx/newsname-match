h 7' V .T.R. Quito Politics
Now What?
AH last week was a busy time
in Chicago, Moose and stand
patters were on hand early and
stayed late that ia all except the
'greatest man in the Republican
W PfosresaiTe ranks who ' quit
before the came was over and
says be is going to stay quit
Col Roosevelt has .announced'
that; hi is out of politics, wont
pose for a picture, the most con
vincing "evidence of Ws sincer
ity, nor say a word to console his
intrepid and faithful followers.
The ; two7 conventions played
the game of politics to perfection
to a certain point, when sudden
ly the regulars vainly trying to
prevent tbe nomination of Jus
tice Hughes were overwhelmed
in the third ballot and the sec
ond attempt to make presiden
tial timber out of an alleged legal
gianb was successful so far as a
nomination was concerned, Jus
Hughes, a United States Supreme
Court Justice to this moment, re
ceived 949i, Roosevelt 18i, weeks
3 and scattering 16. '
It is needless to say that when
Col. Roosevelt was nominated in
the Progressive convention im
mediately after Justice Hughes
had been acclaimed Republican
leader in the other convention
and when word was received
from him direct from Sagamore
Hill that he would not accept the
nomination at that time, but if
the party desired to leave the
matter of a presidential candi
date open, he might later change
his mindT there was' v consterna
tion, tears, denunciation and
procrastination. Such a bunch
of broken hearts will never per
haps be seen again in a political
convention. Top gone and the
bottom dropping out of canned
hope, many of the great men ot
the nation were puzzled to a
standstill. Declarations that
another leader would be named
if the Col. finally declined were
met with unanimous approval
and the pleasure of the preat
Bull Moose awaited with the
settlement of the question left
with the national committee.
Upon receiving word that he
had been nominated, Justice
Hughes telegraphed his accept
ance together with sentiments so
closely along the line of those
which had been promulgated and
pushed all over the country by
Col. Roosevelt, that it was no
wonder that a deal was suspec
ted of which the body of the
Progressives knew nothing. The
platform of tbe Republicans also
bore ear - marks of the Moose
part and unless some under
standing with the Col. had been
secretly established, no man
among all the astute statesmen
and politicians of the Progress
ive convention could account for
the existing conditions.
Simultaneous with the writing
of his letter of acceptance and
principles, Justice Hughes plac

You ask; Is it a good thing to
be in want? It depends on what
you want If needing physical
comforts will bring one into har

yes. But it is better not to
squander one's inheritance. The
problem is to know what to want

not know what he wanted. Thus
the American people want some

not know what they want And

arise to fulfill the wants of the
average citizen. When the peo

government, their educational

other social organizations, it
shows that they have ideals of
something that they think is

All that we value most is
bound up in a society of persons,
Therefore the man of the Twen

society and its institutions can

all his wants at present, for in

individuals. Hence social unrest
We are free to get what we
