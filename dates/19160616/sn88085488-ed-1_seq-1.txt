HARMONY. FRIENDSHIP j
COLFAX AND PULLMAN
ft gt inferences Forgotten When
Citizens of Two Towns Mingle
in liove Feast
v.V
Alter over a quarter of a century
of petty bickering, jealousy and 111- ,
feeling, boardering at times un hut
red, the citizens of Colfax and the
citizens of Pullman took long
draughts from the pipe of peace
Tuesday, mingled together in a spirit
of good fellowship and good feeling,
when the visitors from the
county seat departed Whitman
county's two largest towns were on
better terms than at any time dur
ing those 25 years of strife, pledged
to work together in the best inter
ests of both towns and the entire
county.
Colfax was invited to send a dele
gation from her commercial club to
a joint get-together meeting. The '
county seat boosters responded with
an attendance of 125, and the meet- ;
,ing accomplished everything for ,
which it was intended. The influx
of Colfax citizens and their indies
commenced before 10:00 o'clock, and
by noon over 30 automobiles had ar
rived, a goodly number also coming
by train. Until noon the guests min
gled with Pullman's business men
and saw the sights about town.
When ' George McMahon, chief ,
commissary sergeant, announced that
the banquent was ready. 326 men
and women sat down to the three
big tables in Tanglewood, or found
shady spots beneath the trees and
took their "rations" with them. It
was a feed fit for kings roast beef,
big baked potatoes, brown gravy,
. pickles, baked beans, bread and other
incidentals, and topped off with Ice
cream and cake. Little wonder that
the participants forgot past ill-feel
ings and reveled in joy and good fel
lowship.
Following the feast of food came
the "feast of reason," and speaker
after speaker, introduced by F. C.
Forrest, president of the Pullman
} Chamber of Commerce, lauded the
new and better spirit which prompt
ed the meeting and bespoke for the
two towns and the county great good
|as a result of the promised co-opera- ,
tion and friendship.
Judge Thos. Neill of Colfax, form
erly of Pullman, before that of Col
'ax and previous to that of Pullman,
and all of that time, strangely, on
friendly terms with the people of
both towns, opened the program of
talks. Judge Neill stated that, he .
has observed and knows the better
Qualities as well as the poorer qual
'ties of the people of the two towns,
Ho mentioned the long years of too
heated rivalry, often intensified by
unwarranted remarks or actions by
a few people of one or the other of
the towns, and not representative of
,he feeling of the communities as a
>ole, and suggested that the com
mercial club of each town should
hereafter voice the spirit of that
'°wn, other expressions.-by a few dis
gruntled persons or cliques, not to

FORMER PULLMAN MAN
KILLED AT DAYTON
William Shaw and Companion Killed
When Train Strikes Automobile
— Was Well Know ii Here
William Shaw, until recently a
resident of Pullman, where his son
Vere, and his daughter, Chloe, at
tended college, was instantly killed
at Dayton last Saturday when an
0.-W. R. & N. train struck the auto
mobile in which Air. Shaw anil (i.
W. Robinson of Elma, Wash., were
riding. Mr. Robinson was fatally in
jured, dying the following day. .Mr.
Shaw and Ins family went from Pull

dent, tin- Columbia Chronicle, Day
ton, has the following to say:
William Shaw of Spokane was in
stantly killed ami <;. XV. Robinson of
Elma, Wash., fatally injured Satur
day evening by the incoming 0.-W.
R. & N. train as they were crossing
I lie track near the entrance to the
fair grounds in Mr. Robinson's auto
mobile.
No on.- is able to account for the
tragedy un approaching trains are]
plainly in view from the vicinity of j
the crossing, but the theory is that
the automobile was stalled on eiie
truck either by attempting to stop it
before crossing or by killing the en
gine iv an attempt to accelerate tr.e
speed when Hi.- driver saw the a,
proach of Hie train.
Mr. Shaw and Mr. Robinson were
both here with fast horses for the
racing matinee on Dayton Days, the
former being the owner of Graven

wife, who was here with him.
Mr. Shaw's remains have been
shipped to Condon, Oregon, for bur

DIPLOMAS PRESENTED 10 RECORD
CUSS AT THE STATE COLLEGE
Alumni Ranks Swelled to Extent of 164 when
Graduates Receive Degrees— Dr. F. F.
VVesbrook Delivers Address.
Commencement week, the twenti
eth in the history of the State Col
lege of Washington, ended at noon
Thursday, and the ranks of XV. S. C.
alumni in the state and out of the
state were swelled by 104, the larg
est graduating class in the history
of the State College. The .lasses in
agriculture, horticulture, veterinary
science, home economics and allied
lines were .else., on &_ average, the
largest, in history. All told, there
were til 2 candidates for degrees.
The feature of the commencement
procession was tin' evidence of demo
cratic independence given by Presi
dent Holland in not wearing his
robes of office. Alter the proces
sional, rendered by Dr. Evans on the
organ, the invocation was pro
nounced by Rev. Clark 11. Thomas.
President Holland then stated his ap
preciation of tie- tact that an unusu
ally large number of the parents of
graduates were present.
.Mrs. Kuria Strong rendered a vo
cal solo which was followed by a se
lection by the college orchestra and
a vocal solo by >frs Ina Wright-
Herbst.
F. F. VVesbrook, president of the
University of British Columbia, was
introduced and read his address to
the graduating .lass. He began by
asking'- what the- occasion meant to
them. "Is it an ending or a begin
ning, is it a goal or a milestone?" He
then discussed the work which
awaits them and emphasized the fact
that they should nut devote mora at
tention to economic than social
problems. He urged them to devote
special attention to the work of co
operation and co-ordination. He as
serted that there is too much shirk
ing of responsibility, that parents
sublet the contract of properly train
ing their children to school and Sun
day school teachers. He called at
tention to the too frequent lack of
efficiency in public service, and
dwelt on the duty of those who bad
received the advantage of college
training to use ii for the good of hu
manity and the creation of high and
noble national ideals, In closing he
urged the graduates to adopt the
motto "I serve."
After an organ solo Hi.' degrees
were conferred and the K. A. Bryan
prize in history was awarded to Miss
Lucile Davis and a prize for pro
ficiency in German to Miss E. it.
atrice Barnes, It was also an

ond lieutenant in the regular army.

.Master of Science in Engineering. A.
D. Dunn of Wapato, who graduated
from the college in 1902, and since
then has won fame and fortune as
a breeder of the finest Shorthorn
cattle in the state, received the hon
orary degree, Master of Agricultural
Science. Mr. Dunn graduated in ag
riculture with a class of lit), 10 less
than the present graduate in agricul
ture alone, who numbered 36.
In an address as earnest and force
ful as it was brief, President Holland
then bade farewell to the graduating
class. He thanked them for the co
operation that they had given him
since he assumed control of the col
lege and called attention to the fact
that there had been no trouble
among the student body, adding the
assert that when the Seniors are
right there will be no trouble, be
cause of their influence. He stated
that students were often advised to
put aside their college ideals as soon
as they go out into the world, but
maintained that this is bad advice.
(i« predicted that the graduates
would find that a degree from a col
lege is not a requisite of education,
and urged them not to feel superior
to the rest of humanity and sit on a
mountain top, but to work and co
operate with their fellow citizens. In
conclusion be said "While I can not
claim you as my educational chil
dren, I trust that you will always
regard me at least as a friend."
The address made a profound im
pression and was enthusiastically ap
lauded, After the benediction bad
been pronounced by the Rev. .1. G.

dents and audience gathered iv front
of Bryan hall and joined in singing
