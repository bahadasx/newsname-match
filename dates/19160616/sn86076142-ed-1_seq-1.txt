is no mistaking that fact, for it is
solemnly asserted oy the U. S.

one of the coolest places on the
Pacific Coast yesterday. And at
that the citizens of Tonopah were
worrying and storing away their
furs without any thought of the dis
comfort of others in the great out
side world.
Tonopah enjoyed a maximum of
87 degrees of temperature, as meas
ured by your Uncle Sam. The same

tempted the Truckee trout to climb

comfortable at 100 and Sacramento

frigid for the capital of California.
Pven Portland, away up north, could
not pull down the reading below 88.

bet that Tonopah has the beHt cli
