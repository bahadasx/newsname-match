LONDON, June IS. ( H ; 1 1) p. in.)
Cemfidence prevails among Russian
observers of the offensive along the
southern section of th' battle line
that the' catalog of the successe s wot.
by Genop'.ls Hrusiloff and I.etchitsky
is by no ini'iins complete, tehgrapli
Renter's Petrograd corresponileiit. It
is estimated that the central powers'
losses along the front from the Pnpet
to the Rumanian border now Iota
three hundred thousand, or nearly
half the original effectives.
Great satisfaction is felt with tin
re-estalibshinent of contact with the
Teutons along the w hole soiit liwestiTn
front, but a mention is chiefly cen
tered em the operations for K'ovei,
Vladniiir-V'illivnski, C.i rnowit. and
Kolotnea. Colonel Shnniskv, summar
izing the results of the fighting,
makes the deduction from the latest
Russian official statoiiicn: that the
e ntire line of the Stripa H now nn il
pud by the Russians. Northwest in
l;ucatz a number of goml roads run
eastward to Podgoail'-s railway,
which is regarded as accounting for
the vigor of the resistance in tills
sector of the Russian advance. Tlie
village of Kozin, I r, miles soiithwesi
of Dublin, captured hv the Russians,
is on the road lo Rtody, which bad.
thence to 1.1'iiilnTrf.
Rental in lla-.li.
The precipitunc of the retreat of
the Austrians in many sectors Is
shown by tin fin-t that the Russians
found several telegraphic in: tallalmns
i'liact and now are using them. The
cartridges raptured in t;'e' Slripa
trenches would have sufficed for the
use of the Austrians in the most in
tense sort of firing for several weeks.

WAI'KKGAN, III., June 11. A
point, said to be unmue in the
history of criminal Jurisprudent e, was
brought up today at the Dial of Wil
liam II. orpct, the university student
charged with the murder of Marlon
I'iiubert:
it was. Is the moisture producrei
by introducing a frozen body into a
warm room sufficient to transform
powdered cyanide of potassium into
a solution liriht enough to lose its visi
bility? Dr. RJlph W. Wcbste-r. a toxicolo.
gist of international reputation, intro
duced us a witness for the sLitc, tes
tified that he knew of no record ever
having been taken of such uncut. i.
stances.
Wiicth -r the cyanide of potassium
which caused Marion J a in be rt's death
was administered in liuuid or crystal
iorm is regarded by both s de.s in d-
termining the pree ise manner of hor
death. The stale conte-uds that it was
a solution: the defense that It was
finely powdered crystals.
While commercial cyanide of po
tassium wis accessible to both Orpe t
find Marion, It is costende d by the
state that the alleged purchase of a
two-ounce bottle by Orpet at Madison,
Wis., Is a circumstance tilting the scale
against Orpet.

Luis De La Rosa today made gout,
his threat to raid the border when
one hundred of his men attacked a
small detachment of the Kourteenth
Ainerb an cavalry at San Igliu. 1 1,
forty miles soutneasi of Laredo. His
action cost him eight men killed, sev
eral woiiii,! d and many horses and
some eiUimenl. Ihe American loss
was three killed and six Wi. united.
Major Alonso Gray late today wiis

that Major Gray will he ahle to get
Into touch with the band. Ry day
light this morning the attacking force
had scattered like ipiail. There u
e idciice to show that a lurge part,
perhaps the larger part, had re-entered
Mexico, but other evidence in
diealtd that some of ibein ut least
were scattered along the brush-cop.

The first shot fired by the atl.e klni,

at i a. 111. A seiilty had beard tho
