with her.
The next dav he came back and
took Mr. Nissen to the woman's
home. She lived in a handsomo
apartment in one of the most
ionable quarters of the city. It
turned out that she was a Eussian
princess who, vih her husband
and her da ugh U-:-, had been driven
from Kussia for having taken part
in a nihilist movement. Of all
their large property they had saved
only their jewels. She opened a
little safe and showed the Ameri
can one of the F.nest collections of
diamonds he had ever seen. They
were worth $200,000 or $300,000.
"We sell them a few at a time' '
ehe explained, "just enough of
them each ear to give ns a living.
Perhaps you will wopder why wi
don't sell them all and live on the'
Interest of the money? ' But my'
husband has the gambler's spirit."
The money would not last a year.
;So we part from them piecemeal.
1 1 estimate that -there are enough of
them to keep us twenty years, and
I don't expect to live longer than
l that."
One of those diamonds forms t!o
centerpiece of one of the most ral
nable necklaces in New York. 'A
few others are sent to this country
every year. In the "diamond horse
Bhoo" at the opera there is never &
night when there are not some oi
the jewels of the exiled princess om
