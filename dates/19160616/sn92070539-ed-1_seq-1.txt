It is rather significant of the

I com the Commander in Chief of
the Army, President Wixtdrow
Wilson, the unny was too busy

t .immand. But after the day ,s
work was ended, all the men
seemingly, at Columbus, gather

i ne proclamation and to a brief

Chaplain Hillman, to who is

the ofllcers and the Government,
that God would continue to guide
them to the best protection of

Columbus Still Booming
Tho building boom in Coin in
bus still continues. Contractors
have jobs for weeks ahead and
are working overtime. Every
body seems to bo eajoylng pros
perity and those who have been
wanting to get away from Col
umbus for so long a time have
settled down to business nnd
aro well cnntliiU'd. Columbus
is rapidly glowing nnd is soon to
take ITrst place among tho cities
of the statu.
pure tenor voice gave in addition
to the quartette work a solo
rendition of the "Star Spangled
Banner." tho band joining in the
refrain. Not only was It de
lightful to hoar this patriotic
song given so clearly that the
words could be followed, but it
is refreshing to tlnd someone
In tills broad land who really
knows the words of this great
est of National airs.
Mrs O'Neill spoke, in place of
lit. Uov. F. B. Howden, 1). 1)., of
New Mexico, who h a d been
scheduled to take part in the
Flag Day celebration, but who is
promised for an address near
the Fourth of July if his many
engagements permit.
Chaplain Hillman in iutroduc
ing, as he said, "thu correspond
cut of the two most iuiortant of
tho New York dailies, the New
York Telegraph and the Brook
lyn Eagle," declared that Mrs.
O'Neill was a fitting choice for a
speaker on Flag Day, for not on
ly had she thu lienor of being
daughter to a very brilliant nav
al olliCer who served the Hag for'
a quarter of a century, but th.it
every man of her line for six
generations of American history
had borne a commission in citlior
the army or navy nnd that us
Mrs. O'Neill herself could not
follow the Hag, she was giving
her time to telling the Public Hue
tilings about the men who were
enlisted under the Stars and
Stripes.
Mrs. O'Neill spoke briefly, and
was listened to with profound
attention us she told of the tine
things that come out of the fur
mice, of war. Tuat horrible as
Is machine made warfare, honor
and devotion nnd self-forgetting
was the gold that shown in the
life of the soldier who did his
part in battle, and that her ob
servation of war in many coun
tries and as fought by many men
was it became a glorious and well
orth while thing, when it was
for love of country.
Mrs. O'Neill reminded her
hearers that "they also servo
who only stand and wait," and
tho' it was hard on the spirit of
the soldiers to be so near to war
without having a chance to tight,
it was as much service to the Hag
to wait orders patiently, aH to
rush Into the fray.
Trustees Hold Important Meeting
The city dads held a scelal
meeting Tuesday evening and
another Wednesday evening for
the pui'osc of making some ar
rangement to supply the city
with a sutllciuut supply of water.
Plans have been drawn up for
a large tank and tower at the new
city well and the "fathers" are
now receiving bids for the ereo
tion of the same. The tower is
to be thirty feet high, and the
top of thu tank will be forty-live
feet, which should give ample
pressure for any part of town.
The city has outgrown the old
well nnd nt this time the plant
does not begin to furnish the
necessary amount of ugua. Con
structlnn work is being held up
now on several buildings on ac
count of water, but we are hope
ful that this will not be the case
long, ami tho trustees believe
that thoy will have the now sys
tem in opoiatiou by the first of
July.
Election Bet Settled
A contract was entered into
between Buck Cliadboruo nnd A
J . Evans, local agent for the Ford
car, to the otfect that if a certain
candidate was nominated at the
primaries, Chad borne was to buy
a car. The candidate was uomi
nated alright, but evidently Buck
had forgotten all about the con
tract. He went to Detniug to at
tend the hanging bee and when
lie returned home he found a new
Iliver in his yard. Upon ques
tinning ins family he learned that
the car was a Krmanent fixture
in the Chadborue family When
lie met Evans he was reminded
of the contract entered into be
fore the election. He made, no
comment but took out the old
cheek book and completed the
other details of the transaction.
Business Enterprises Needed
A man stated to the Courier a
lew days ago that we had
enough I usiness enterprises
here now. Yes, in some lines
we have but there aro several
things Columbus needs and
would supH)i't that would realize
the owner a good proiit. One
thing we need at this time is an
ice plant. A bottling works
would tlnd a large demand for
their products. A tirst class
bakery would have plenty to do
if they supplied thu local mar
kets, many other business en
terprises would have a Held to
themselves.
Merry-Go-Rouud
There will be a large steam
merry-go-round in town. Will
open not later than the 17th. Come
and bring your friends or chil
dren nnd have a good time.
Tickets will cost 5 cents.

Found Villa Litter
A rude litter, made of yucca
I plant (tolls and made together at
i the ends with iron hoops taken
off a barrel, was found on the
east side of the middle peak of
the Tres Hermanns Wednesday
by W. J. Homes, William Allbee
and J. L. Hoghland, who were at
the time the litter was found,
trying to locate an old prospect
hole.
They were attracted to a re
cently vacated camp and noting
tlut evidently someone had been
living on conned goods for quite
awhile, began to look around for
some clue as to who would have
romped at such a spot. The
strttcher was found only a few
feet from thu camp and the only
explanation so far advanced is
that one of the wounded ofllcers
on the morning of March ilth was
carried out. Mr. Homes thinks
it was a Carranzista oflicer and
that they knew this would bo tlx
only moans of getting the wound
ed man away without detection.
Big Boxing Event.
Tuesday, June 20th, the Air

And for the preliminary, Jim
Wilson of El Paso, against Jack
McDaniel of the 24th Inft; both

An agreeable feature of the
evening will be the attendance
of the 21th Inft. Band. A full
house is a foregone conclusion

Cantonment Model
U. S. Army Hospital
Preparedness In Medical Branch of
Army Just as Much Important
as in the Fighting Branches
A Red Cross flag hovering over
the cantonment hospital at the
base of the punitive expedition
here, is one of the comforting
sights that greets a soldier return
ing from the heart breaking trip
across the desert wastes of north
ern Chihuahua. This flag flutters
in the breeze beside the Stars and
Stripes and spells to him medical
attention, a clean bed and
strengthening food. Not a few
soldiers stricken with illness con
tracted in the relentless drive of
the American troops over the with
ering sands and the chilling moun
tain peakrf have described the
rough wooden building as u para
disc. Twelve weeks ago there was in
course of construction a rough
frame building intended to be di
vided into a number of sets of
"'quarters" for the officers of the
13th cavalry stationed in the bor
der town of Columbus, New Mex
ico. In a few hours this town
sprung into international im
portance after the raid of the
Villistas; and immediately, under
the supervision of Lieutenant Col
onel Euclid B. Frick, this par
tially finished wooden shed, for it
vas little more, was converted in
to a cantonment hospital. In re
nlity a "shoestring affair," but to
day complete in every detail, as far
as the needs of the sick or the
wounded soldier is concerned.
The general ward for the men is
supplemented by the hospital tents
which are used for the less seri
ously ill. There are also isolation
tents, for even in the short time
of occupation there have been sev
eral "catching" diseases which
have been treated successfully
without any spread of contagion.
There is n ward for officers, con
taining three beds, and these are
always full, for the officers are
not sparing themselves in this ex
pedition and suffer accordingly.
The cantonment hospital is
really a clearing house for the
sick- for unless there is a fair
chance of the patient being up and
ready for service in a short time
he is carefully sent by train to Ft.
Bliss about sixty-eight miles dis
tant for further treatment in the
Hospital there or in exceptional
cases to Fort Sam Houston. Pull
man sleeping car acommodntion is
being furnished to all seriously ill
always excepting any patient
whose condition is too precarious
to bear transportation, in which
case the sick or wounded soldier
is kept at the cantonment hospital
indefinitely.
SWIMMING POOL
OPEN
Plenty Good Fresh
Clean Water
One Half Mile West of Town
Just North of Railroad
Organization of Civic League.
All women interested in tho
betterment of Columbus, nnd
the beautifying and making the
town worthy of Its placeln pub
lic affairs are earnestly Invited
to meet at tho M E Church Fri
day June 23 with a view to tho
formation of a Woman's Civic
League. Dues will bo very
small, but it is desired that the
League shall be thoroughly rep
resentative of the best element
of women living here, so that by
cooperation the town will bo
more sanitary, and more desir
able as a residence for all.
Three p. in. Is the hour chosen
as most convenient, and least
conllicting with other appoint
ments.
There have, within the six weeks
of establishment, been more than
six hundred patients treated here.
The daily average is hard to strike,
but there have been as many ns
seventy patients under treatment
at one time, and on one occasion
forty new cases were admitted
within twenty-four hours. All re
ceiv expert attention, and prac
tically none have died. A rather
brilliant achievement, even the
least enthusiastic layman will ad
mit. Under the long low roofs of the
two chief buildings of the hospi
tal are to be found the following
nil improved, somewhat crude and
primitive, but be well equipped for
practical work: an officer; a dis
pensary; a dental surgeon's office;
a" laboratory; one long ward room
for the soldiers; the officers' ward ;
an operating room; a sterilizing
plant, small but very effective; and
further away a kitchen where two
'cooks turn out such good food that
one longs to be invalided for n
while for the benefit of the good
diet.
In various tents there are sur
gical supplies, comprising every
thing that may be needed for the
soldier be he ill or wounded; nor
has the necessity for ample re
serve medical supplies been over
looked. Adjacent to the hospital
in the Base Medical Supply Depot
j with its "issue room" and store
tent, the latter of which is piled
high with an abundance of all
sorts of "Medicol.. and Hospital
I Supplies," from medical and surgi
1 cal dressing to tentage, field cook
I ing outfit, and even extra "horse
I equipment" for men of the Hos-
pital Corps who have to be mount
ed. Judging from the visible stock
there will be no cause for the coun
try to complain that the medical
department of the Army has failed
1 to provide all of the necessary
medical supplies nnd many of the
luxuries for the sick and wound
ed poldiers.
