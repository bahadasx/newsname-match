DESCRIBING RAID
Bandits Encountered Larger
American Force Than
They Expected.
Washington, June 16.—A consular
dispatch direct from Durango, Mexi
co, received today said there was no
truth in the report circulated and
generally credited a few days ago that
the American consulate there had
been burned during an anti-American
demonstration. The consul raid there
had been no attack on the Consulate.
Uavira Thought Safe.
There was no confirmation here to
day of the report from El Paso that
General Gavira had been executed in
Mexico City-, charged with treason for
having entered into an unauthorized
Conference with General Pershing.
It was officially reported some days
ago that the Mexican officer had been
ordered to the capital. Despatches
from Special Agent Rogers yesterday
made no mention of him.

A sentry heard'voices in the brush"

hours. He" called the' corporal of the

men to investigate. They fired and the
shooting aroused the camp. The
troopers sprang from their tents into
shallow trenches prepared for such an
emergency and poured an answering
lire into the/brush. One of the three
cavalrymen killed was shot as he
emerged from his tent.
Leader Unknown.
The name of the raiders' leader has
not been reported. From the body of
one of the Mexicans killed papers
were taken that Indicated that he
was Cruz Ruis, a major in Carranza'a
army. Undue importance was not at?
tached to this discovery by army offi
cers, however, who believe it not im
probable that Ruis was' carrying the
papers more as souvenirs of the days

No More Troops.
General Funston has not ordered
more troops to reinforce Major Gray's
command, but if he succeeds In find

Wilson and Marshall Renominated by Acclamation at the
Session Thursday Night—Foreign Plots Are
Attacked in "America First" Plank.
St. L/ouls. June 1A.—Tlic reading of the platform in the democratic
conventIon's final session today was punctuated with cheers, particu
lar! tliosr sort ions favoring military and naval preparedness: the stand
011 the Mexican situation, mid the "Americanism" plank drawn bv WIN
son, and the endorsement of the Underwood tariff act.
The reading was concluded at 1:20 o'clock. The minority report
tor substitute woman's suffrage plank was offered. The majority
pla.nk recommended the extension of the franchise to women "by states
upon the same terms as men.'* Close attention was given to the read
in ir of the plank relating to foreign policies.
The "Americanism" plank's denunciation of conspirators for the
advancement of foreign influence in this country was roundly appla*id»
ed, as was Its criticism of disloyalty by some Americans.
St. Louis, June 10.—To adopt its declaration of principles, the dem»
ocratlc national committee met in final session today, after having re
nominated by acclamation President Wilson and Vice PresidentMar
shall. The enthusiasm which characterised the proceedings last night,
was still apparent today.
Some delegates smiled when It was suggested last night that the
rush to effect the nomination was due to a superstition regarding tak
ing such action on 1-Vlday. Senator Kern, who had prepared a long
speech nominating Vice President Marshall, discarded it. merely saying
in the name of Indiana, that he nominated Marshall.
"AMERICA FIRST."
Condemnation of activities of all persons, groups or organisations
in the United States who conspire to advance the interests of foreign
powers was contained in the Americanism plank adopted today by the
resolutions committee.
"We charge," the plank declares, "that such conspiracies among
a limited number exist and have been instigated for the purpose of ad
vancing the interests of foreign countries to the prejudice and detri
ment of our country, and we condemn any political party, which in
view of the activity of such conspirators surrenders its Integrity or
modifies Its policy."
FOR PREPAREDNESS.
Thorough preparedness on land and sea. against unexpected ln
vaslon, and the joining, of the Vnitefl States with other nations to "as
sist the world in securing deltlM .peace and justice," is also uifed in
other planks adopted.'
