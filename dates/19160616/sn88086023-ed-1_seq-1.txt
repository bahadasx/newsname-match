LONDON, June 16. With Czernowitz semi-officially re
ported tej be captured, the Russian offensive is driving west
ward toward Stanislau in an effort to cut off Austrian com
munication! between Lemberg and the southern portion of the
Austrian line. If successful the Austrian Czernowitz army
must either stand its ground or retreat through the Carpathians
and down into the plains of Hungary. Berlin, Petrograd and
Vienna reports indicate that the Austrians have stiffened their
defense in an effort to prevent a complete cut. The Russians
continue to advance steadily around Lutsk.
NEW ATTACKS LAUNCHED.
PARIS, June 16. After a period of infantry inaction the
Germans launched violent attacks at Thiaumont farm and in
the Cailette woods, says a communique. All the attacks were
repulsed. Sometimes the French artillery fire was so heavy
the Germans were killed in the trenches before emerging.
West of the Meuse the Germans launched seven counter-attacks
against Deadman's Hill. French captured 185 Germans.
At six o'clock last night the Germans made a powerful attack
! nrth of Thiaumont. Mitrailleuse fire checked the attacks, the
Germane losing heavily.
Further attacks were launched at 10 o'clock at. the edco nf '
on- j the Cailette woods. A French curtain of fire checked these at
H tacks. At some points the Germans were unable to iump from '
the trenches.
