CUT BANK, TETON COUNTY, MONTANA, FRIDAY, JUNE 16, 1916.
Two Dollars Per Year
Work on Great Nor. Roundhouse Enlargement Begins
Great Enthusiasm
Being Generated
Committees are Working Hard
For a Big and Good
Celebration
As the time approaches for
the big Fourth celebration in
terest and enthusiasm increases.
There was a spirited meeting
in the Pioneer Press office on
Tuesday evening, attended by
those on the different com
mittees. Ways and means
were thoroughly discussed for
the carrying out of all details
of the program. A number of
nev features for the sporting
program werj discussed and if
the general committee can
provide the funds these features
will be added. Another can
vass will be made to endeavor
to provide additional funds, to
insure a "best ever" celebration.
George Berns very generously
offered the committee the ser
vice of himself and his engine,
which he will attach to a road
grader and level off the base
ball diamond and race track.
He also volunteered to move
the pavilion from its present
site to any place the committee
may designate, free of charge.
If the committee can secure
consent to have it moved Mr.
Berns' offer will certainly be
accepted.
The different committees will
continue to work with a will
from no$ until the ÉÉ£bration
comes to a close. All citizens
should cooperate in every way
in making their work as effect,
ive as possible.
An Armenian section hand
was shot and killed by a Greek
on Tuesday evening, on the
railway right-of-way west of
Lubec. The shooting was the
result of a violent quarrel. The
murderer made a hurried get
away in his shirt sleeves and
officers are now on his trail.
Local officials are on the look
out for the man.
Federal court is now in session
at Helena and the calendar is
the longest in years, there being
about a hundred and sixty
cases. Many cases originating
on the Blackfeet will be tried.
Excitement is in store for the
"kids" in this man's town.
Halvorson & Co are putting on
an auto contest. See the little
machine in the window and
ask for particulars.
Our metropolitanism is now
complete. Col. Donahue has
secured a gen'eman of ebon hue
to officiate as porter and shine
in his barber shop. "Next?"
M. A. O'Neil is doing the
cement work on the basement
for the Chas. Lynch residence.
Fred Barrington is now em
ployed at the Teton.
Sleepless Nights
and troubled days are the portion of the man
who "takes his own insurance risk."
Is the possible saving of a few dollars worth
the worry during the crop growing season?
If your crop is hit by hail a whole year's work
will be pounded back into the earth
And to bemoan your luck and rail at Fate will
little avail. The business man takes no chance.

Slips Out of Port
and Torpedoes
Browning
The Cut Bank baseball fleet
stole out from its harbor last
Sunday afternoon, made a dash
at its old baseball enemy, the
Browning squadron, and anni
hilated it, amid the plaudits of
frenzied Cut Bank fans. But
enough of this salt sea talk.
We might get our metaphors
mixed.
The innocent home folks
hardly had a suspicion of the
existance of a baseball squad.
They sauntered out to the pill
park in the expectation of see
ing a few social amenities
that is, they expected to see
Cut Bank hand Browning
something wrapped in tin foil
and on a gold platter. Perhaps
Browning expected that the
ceremonies would be some
thing like that. But to the
glad tidings. Cut Bank went
in and won the contest. Score
15 to 16. Plenty scores, eh?
The feature of the outdoor
argument was the three-base
hit of George Berns in the
fourth. It was a blue after
noon, too for Eddie Godert, the
pitching joy and of the Agency.
When the local hitters eased oft
on Gobert he was what is
known in political parlance as
a "lame duck."
But we should pause betöre
becoming too braggish. Cut
Bank will run up to Browning
Sunday and there may be
something else to tell in our
next. The Sunday game has
uncorked the baseball spirit
here and we hope to see a
sizzling contest on the Fourth.

Commenting on the Brown
ing-Cut Bank game, played
here Sunday, the Review says:
The only excuse the boys are
able to give as the cause of
their defeat reminds us of the
fellow who led his bull dog to a
fight and as a result of the fight
was compelled to take him home
in a wheelbarrow. He said his
dog would have won the fight if
it had not been for the other
dog.
Excavation Work is Now
Uuder Way. "Dismal
Swamp" is Filled;
Much Activity
in Railway
Circles
Five carloads of material, including scrapers,
horses and mules and other equipment for excavat
ing for the addition to the Cut Bank roundhouse of
the Great Northern arrived this week. A number
of shacks on the right-of-way were moved in a
hurry and the work of cutting into the hillside
south of the roundhouse is now in progress. A big
machine that does the excavating and dumps the
dirt into the wagons is pulled by ten horses and
mules and there are four pushers. The dirt is be
ing hauled into the "Dismal Swamp" surrounding
the Great Northern hotel and the unsightly hole is
being rapidly filled.
As soon as the excavation work iu completed
work on the roundhouse extension will begin and
ten 180-foot stalls will be added, making the round
house over as large again as at present and giving
Cut Bank one of the largest engine houses on the
main line. Considerable new trackage will be laid,
changes in trackage will be made, it is planned to
raise the G. N. hotel and dormitory and make other
minor improvements here. It is probable that this
work will consume the greater part of the summer
and the additional payroll will mean quite a little.
The increase in railway business at the local ter
minal has almost doubled-that of last year. Dur
ing the month of May, 1915 10,310 cars passed out
of this terminal. The corresponding month this
year shows 16,571 cars. More men have been added
in the different departments and new help is being
put on constantly. The local terminal is rapidly
growing in importance and the benefit accruing to
Cut Bank must not be underestimated.
Local Republicans Elated Over the
Nomination of Charles Evans Hughes

Hughes Club To Be Organized Soon
The news of the nomination
of Chas. E. Hughes as the re
publican candidate for president
was hailed by Cut Bank re
publicans with genuine en
thusiasm. There has never
been much "mooseism" or
"fussyism" in the ranks of
local republicans and the placing
at the head of the G. O. P.
ticket of such a sane, sound
statesman as Hughes was
hailed here as a master stroke.
Mayor S. L. Potter has been
circulating a petition this week,
among the republicans of the
Cut Bank precinct, for the
formation of a Hughes club.
A large number of signatures
'Fourth of July Number' Next Week
Next week the Pioneer Press will issue a Fourth of
July number giving full details of the celebration program.
The issue will cover this entire section and the Blackfeet.
Merchants who desire to patronize this issue should
ask for space reservation early. This is the time to reach
the young folks who will want to be "togged up" for the
big celebration.
Celebrate With Us, July 4th
have been attached to the paper
and a meeting will shortly be
held, to perfect an organization.
The republicans of the Cut
Bank precinct expect to put a
lot of "pepper" into the cam
paign this fall and will be on
the alert at all times to make
sure that their wily friends
the-enemy, the unterrified
democrats, put nothing across
on them.
Following the two big Darty
conventions the national, state
and county campaigns will un
doubtedly assume an aggressive
aspect. The fight this fall
promises to be the most ex
citing ever witnessed within
the memory of the electorate.
Elevator Case Of
Interest to Our
Farmers
Helena, June 15,—The appeal
of the state from the order of
the district court of Teton
county dismissing the case
against the Rocky Mountain
Elevator company for alleged
violation of the anti-discrimi
nation laws, was set for hear
ing by the supreme court today
for June 22.
The complaint charged that
the defendant maintained
elevator at Choteau and Dutton
among other places. There
was no competition at Dutton
but there is at Choteau. There
is a difference of one cent in
freight rates to eastern and
western terminals between the
two places, and a difference of
a cent and a half to Great Falls.
January 19, 1915, a farmer de
livered a load of wheat to the
Dutton elevator, receiving $1.11
a bushel and with five pounds
deducted for dockage. The
same day he hauled another
load from the same bin to Cho
teau, where there is competition
receiving $1.20 a bushel with
only one pound deducted for
dockage.
The lower court held the
complaint was insufficient and
the law, passed in 1913. too am
biguous to define a crime.
Kline Home 'Entered'
The home of Mr. and Mrs.
Paul Kline of Pleasant Valley
was entered recently during
the absence of Mr. and Mrs.
Kline. Those who forced the
entrance did not follow the
practice that is in vogue in
some sections—that of carrying
away everything that could
be "lifted." Instead they de
posited a splendid silver set, as
a gift to the newlyweds. Mr.
and Mrs. Kline desire through
the Pioneer Press to extend
thanks to the unknown callers
and general gift-givers.
Sustains Bad Burns
Mrs. J. P. Carberry went to
Glacier Park last week to
open her curio store for the
season. She met with quite a
painful accident the first eve
ning after her arrival in light
ing a large gasoline lamp. After
lighting the lamp she undertook
to pump air into it and some of
the gasoline was forced out
over her hands and took fire
burning one of her hands quite
severely.
Mr. and Mrs. M. J. Halvorson
and little son returned last
evening, after a visit of several
weeks at St. Paul, LaCrosse,
Wis., and other points in Minne
sota and Wisconsin.

Bankers Paper Warns Public to
Use Care in Dealing
With Suck
Montana Bankers and farmers
seeking loans and investors
looking for an out-let for their
funds are warned in an editorial
in the June issue of the Mon
tana Banker, just issued at
Helena, to beware of the
mushroom mortgage concerns
and inexperienced farm mort
gage men, who are operating in
the state. The publication says:
"Farm mortgage bankers of
Montana as well as other
northwestern states, because of
their inability to supply the
demand of high-class mortgages,
find themselves confronted
with a situation which unless
guarded will result in a harvest
of foreclosures, and a shattering
of the confidence of an im
portant class of investors.
"The remarkable market [for
farm mortgages during the last
few months has been the in
ception of a large number of
mushroom mortgage concerns,
and have attracted to the
business many inexperienced •
men, whose investment offer
ings would naturally be more or
less of an inferior character.
"Investors who have con
fidence enough in this part of
the c^^^ to lend their
capita^^rused in developing
the farms deserve to be warned
of the danger ot dealing with
those people. Large amounts
of money will be required each
year for many years to come
to insure proper development
of the agricultural resources of
the state, and to obtain this
capital readily the present high
standing of the Montana farm
mortgage must be maintained.
"The farmer is even more
likely to become a victim than
is the investor, and should be
advised to exercise due diligence
in negotiating loans. The chief
danger to him lies in his in
ability to judge when he needs
capital and the amount he
needs. Coupled with honest
information on this point would
be given careful instruction
and interested advice in the
expenditure of his money
should the borrower be dealing
with his local bank or an es
tablished farm mortgage cor
poration.
Has Foot Crushed
Dr. Nelson was called to
Bla ckfoot the other evening, to
administer relief to a railway
carpenter, who sustained a
crushed foot while boarding a
freight train. Dr. Nelson ac
companied the injured man to
the Havre hospital.
