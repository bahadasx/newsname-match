NARROW ESCAPE FOR

i Iannis
Pownal People Just Miss
ed Under Train
Six well known Pownal people rf9
an almost miraculous escape irom
deata when the two horses, attached
to the three-seated wagon in which
they were riding, dashed madly into
an eastbound passenger train, going
4 a rate of 40 milea an hour at the
railroad crossing just below the post
office in that town Tuesday after
noon. One of the horses went under
the wheels of the train and was ground
to death and the six people in the
wagon escaped death by a few inches.
The second horse was so badly injured
that it had to be shot.
Those in the wagon were Harry
Beals, the driver, alone in the front
seat, Mrs. Arthur Ladd, Mrs. Lawrence
Ladd and Mrs. Bertha Ladd Johnson
In the middle seat, and Dr. L. D. Ladd
and Mrs. Beals in the rear seat. The
party was returning from the funeral
of Mrs. Rhoda Mason, and having been
to the postofnce, stopped in front of
Parker & Sons' store. The train which
was passing over the crossing a shrt
distance away, frightened the horses
and they began to , reaf and prance.
Mr. Beals applied the whip and imme
diately the horses dashed widly to
wards the swiftly moving train. The
men in the wagon were horror-stricken
and the women became hysterical as it
seemed that escape from death would
be impossible. Mr. Beals is a slight
man and although straining himself to
the utmost he was unable to stop the
infuriated animals in their mad rush
towards the train. Mrs. Lawrence
Ladd and Mrs. Johnson leaned over
and each seized a rein, adding their
strength to that of Mr. Beals to no
avail, for the horses could not be stop
ped or turned aside. They dashed head
long into the onrushing train and were
thrown to the ground, one of them go
ing under the 'Wheels and being crush
ed to death. To the horrified onlook
ers it seemed as it no power could save
the six people from a frightful death.
However, when the heavy pole of
the wagon struck the train it caused
the wagon to swing around so that it
was faced In the same direction as the
train and was parallel to it with only
a few inches of space intervening. For
several seconds the wagon swung peril
ously about and had it overturned to
wards the west all the occupants would
undoubtedly have been thrown under
the wheels of the train. Those who
saw the wagon almost touching the
train declare that it was a sight that
they can never forget. The wagon was
so close to the train that hte rear
wheel lightly touched it. Dr. Ladd re
mained cool throughout and was out of
the wagon as soon as it struck the
train, assisting the women to alight.
Mr. Beals, according to eyewitness
es, had the narrowest escape of all, as
the dashboard Just in front of him was
dashed to pieces from contact with the
train.
The ladies were completely unnerved
bv their harrowing experience. One
of the horses had been in the Ladd fanv
ily for years and was highly valued
The other was purchased recently and
this was said to have been the cause
' of the trouble.
MASONIC GRAND LODGE
Address at Burlington By Grand
ter C. H. Darling.
Mas-
rturlington, June 14 The 12M an
trial communication of the Grand
Ldge of Masons of Vermont opened
thi: morning in the Masonic temple
with the address of Grand Master
Charna H. Darling. As Harry J
Stamftrd of Barton, deputy grand mas
ter, dedjnes to be considered for
the hone of heading the grand lodge,
it is expeted that at the annual eleo
tion tomorrow David A. Elliott of
White Hive Junction will be- chosen
grand nmstei He is at present grand
Henlor deacon..
Grand Maste Darling prefaced his
address with reference to the death
during the year if Past Grand Master
Marsh O. Perkins of Windsor and
Past Senior Warde William II. Vin
ton of lirattleboro.
The grand master reported that
there have been 501 nndo Masons In
Vermont during the yi.r: 205 have
died; net gain in membeuhop of 286
The fraternity has a membership of
14.241 In the state.
He advocated the eontlnuaicc of the
annunl appropriation of $looo for the
permanent charity fund. LaBt year
the amount expended from this fund
was $2764.8(1. Keferring to the ex
penditures from this fund the grand
master Bald:
"In this respect I have been Im
pressed with a notion that obtains
among some Masons and, occasionally,
in some jurisdictions that the Mason
lc Institution is an Insurance com mm y
and that the payment of dues is a
sort of Insurance against accident and
HlcknoBB and that the question of
whether the brother Is worthy or
whether ho comes to want by reason
of vicious and, perhaps, criminal hah
its does not enter Into the case.
"No theory enn bn further from tho
truth thnn such a theory. Our dues
are not based upon the amount re
quired as an Insurance premium, and
It In on of the first rules and one of
the earliest taught tlint In the dlsposl
tlon of charity, the brother shall npply
to us as such and we find him worthy
"And while I do not ndvocnto the
dodging of Issues nor technical ex
cuses to satisfy the conscience, while
I uphold the universality of Masonic
charity, It is good for brethren to r
member that charity Is a voluntary
offering on the one hand, and that tho
brother must maintain his worthiness
on the other.'

Strengthens Determination Not to
Withdraw Troops
NOTE TO CARRANZ4 READY
First Chief Will Be Told That He Has
Failed to Protect Northern
Border.
Washington, June 15. Secretary
Lansing's draft of the note which will
refuse General Carranza's demand for
withdrawal of American troops from
Mexico was laid before President Wil
son for his approval today almost
simultaneously with receipt of news
of another border raid in which the
camp of the Fourteenth cavalry at
San Ygnacio, Tex., was attacked and
throe troopers killed.
Punitive steps against those respon
sible for the new depredation were
left to the discretion of the border
commanders, whose standing orders
are to pursue into Mexico any hot
truil tliey find. The development,
however, immediately was called to
the attention of the de facto govern
ment, and will be one of the elements
on which the administration, in its
reply to Carranza, will predicate its
declaration that the time for with
drawal is not yet llpe because Mex
ican troops are not properly policing
the border country.
Anti American demonstrations
throughout the republic, which will
also back up this declaration, have
worked with the growing seriousness
of economic conditions to produce
such a grave situation that officials
here fear a new internal upheaval
soon and have taken further steps to
protect Americans. An army trans
port is being held in readiness at Gal
veston to proceed to Mexican ports
for refugees, another has been ordered
to the vicinity of the Mexican west
coast, and the heavy transport Han
cock, now taking marines to Santo Do
mingo, will go from that port to Vera
Cruz as soon as she has completed her
piesent mission.
Y. M. C. A. IN THE WAR
Local Organization Helps Maintain
"War" Secretary In France
The Young Men's Christian Associa
tions of Vermont have a "war" secre
tary in Prance.
There is probably no more remark
able story of the war than that of the
activities and work of the Y. M. C. A.
In the training camps, prisoner-of-war
camps, hospitals and trenches, which
is employing over seventy-five special
secretaries on the field.
In England half the peerage are en
rolled as workers, ladles of title sac
rillce their leisure to aid in running
hostels in various parts of Kngland,
others of the best families, hundreds in
number, are in Egypt, Malta, or Flan
ders devoting their entire time to Y. M
C. A. service.
There are 129 centers In France. In
one place a disused convent has been
turned Into a center; in several others
estamlnets have been utilized, while
right at the front itself where the big
guns roar their messages continuously
a rat-Infested barn was transformed
Into a cheery, bright and attractive
liot'tel. In places where buildings are
not ready nt hand commodious huts
are erected with steaming coffee and
wholesome food in readiness day and
night.
In the field, wherever military condi
tions permit, pianos arc Installed, con
certs and sing-songs are frequent, and
the huts, in addition to amplo food
supplies, are equipped with an ampli
tude ol Innocent .games. Religions ex
crciscs are of an Interdenominational
character; and it has been one of the
surprises of the war how far sectarian
lines have disappeared in caring for
the spiritual welfare of the soldiers.
The moral effect upon the men by
the Y. M. C. A. work has according to
the commanding officers, been im
mense. That It has promoted temper
ance and decency of language and be
havlor is unquestioned.

INDUSTRIAL SCHOOL
State Officers Attend Graduating Exer
cises at Vergennes.
Vergennes, June 14. Honored by
the presence of the state's executive
and other distinguished guests, favor
ed with the fairest of June days and
made happy at the close of the festivi
ties with a 25-mile automobile ride, 12
pupils of the Vermont Industrial
school this afternoon received certi
ficates showing they have completed
the course of study which will entitle
them to admission to advanced insti
tutions of learning. The fact that
these pupils with 200 and more com
panions are wards of the state was
forgotten by those who attended the
exercises as there was nothing to indi
cate that the children are under the
jurisdiction of the penal board. To
those not acquainted with the insti
tution the exercises might have been
those of some large school to be found
in a dozen places in Vermont.
The thoroughness of instruction was
manifest in every essay and there
was a finish about the program that
spoke volumes for those in authority
at the school and for the higher au
thority, the penal board, which wds
represented today by Judgo John E.
Weeks of Middlebury, chairman. The
pupils' affection for Judge Weeks was
displayed at the close of his remarks.
Gov. Gates and Rev. D. J. O'Sulli-
van, the latter of St. Albans, spoke
to the pupils, the governor being wel
comed by Jessie Kenneson of Mont-
pelier, a member of the class. Alfred
Danfoith of Bennington gave an ap
preciation of Judge Weeks. Harry
Staples of lirattleboro was valedic
torian. The class members are: Jes
sie Kenneson, Agnes Mehan, Bculah
Sargent, John Allen, Robert Brown,
Merrill Cantell. Alfred Danforth, Den
nis Donavan, Oscar Griggs, Leon
Hutchins, Leo Laliante, Richard Le
mieux, Harry Staples and George
Troup.
The guests from out of town were
met at the railroad station and taken
in automobiles to the school where
luncheon was served by the boys
shortly after 1 o'clock. The meal
was prepared by the pupils of both
sexes under the direction of the teach
ers. At the close of the luncheon.
which was served in the adminis
tration building, the guests went to
the chapel where the exercises were
held.
The chapel interior was decorated
with the class colors of crimson and
gold and there was displayed the class
motto, "Onward is Our Aim." The
14 graduates wore red carnations and
small Vermont state seals. The pu
pils to receive diplomas marched to
the chapel to tho music of the school
band and orchestra.
The results of tho honor system are
shown In the announcement that only
4G of the 2Si', inmates of the school
are kept under lock and key, nights
less than 12 are watched during the
day and out of an average attendance
of 243 there have been but four who
made an attempt to leave the school
during a year's period. During the
past two months 55 pupils have been
paroled as the school is crowded.
Announcement was made today that
an attempt will be made to secure
funds to permit graduates to pursue
studies in higher institutions. Super
intendent and Mrs. J. N. Barss receiv
ed many compliments during the nd
dresses. Gov. Gates approved the
move toward securing advanced in
struction for those finishing the regu
lar school work.
Tho guests included Gov. C.
W. Gates and his son and niece
of Franklin, Rev. D. J. O'Sullivan of
St. Albans, Judge J. E. Weeks, Supt.
M. H. Lonkes of the house of corree
tlon, E. C. Tut tie. Miss Berenice Tut
tie and Rev. G. W. Peck, jr.. of Rutland
Mrs. Pratt of the Children's home at
Burlington and Judge F. C. Dyer of

KURN HATTIN LECTURE
Instructive Slides to Be Shown by Miss
Sessions Sunday Evening.
Miss K. Eliza Sessions, representa
tive of the Kurn Hat tin homes is to
apenk at the Congregational church
Sunday evening in the interests of the
Institution. A recent issue of the Kurn
Hattln publication has the following:
"Bellows Falls was treated to some
thing new on Sunday evening, March
12. The churches of tho community
united In n service in the interest of
The New England Kurn Hattin Homes.
The service was held In the Congre
gational church nnd the Bpeakcr of the
evening was Miss K. Kliza Sessions.
Miss Sessions has spoken in all the
churches of Bellows Falls in other
years, nnd so she was not new. But
while she Is always listened to with
pleasure, a vividness was given to her
address by 94 stereopticon slides,
which showed up in a most interesting
way buildings and boys and sports and
work, nnd served to give a clearer
Idea of the Homes than could be gained
In any other way except by an actual
visit to tho Homes. It Is hoped thnl
these pictures may be seen in a Rood
many communities. The slides, which
were made by Mr. K. W. Goodrich, of
Boston, were very dear and proved
perfectly satisfactory In every way.''

We wish to express our heartfelt ap
preciation of the many acts of kind

Total Prisoners for Thirteen Days

FATE OF CZERNOWITZ UNKOWN
Capital of Bukowlna is Semi-Officially
Reported to Have
Surrendered
London, June 15. The twelfth day
of the great Russian offensive against
tho Austro-llungarians and Germans
from Volhynia to Iiukowina shows no
where any signs of slackening. All
along the front fresh gains for the
Russian troops and the capture of
thousands additional prisoners and of
guns, machine guns and war supplies
are claimed by the Rusisans. The ag
gregate of prisoners now exceeds
150,0110
While semi-official advices from
Petrograd give a report that the Atis
tians have evacuated Czemowiaz,
capital of Bukowlna, the latest official
communication from Austrian head
quarters says the troops of Emperor
Francis Joseph are making a stand
north and cast of the city and at both
points have repulsed Russian attacks.
In the drive westward from the re
gion of Lutsk the Austrians are coun
ter attacking or entrenching them
selves in new positions for a stand
agaitist the Russians.
No reports of gains for either side
in Galicia in the region of Tarnapol
have come through. Here apparently
is still a deadlock hetweeu the Rus
sians and the Austrians and Germans.

FORTY-TWO MISSING
Occupants of One Lifeboat from
the
Steamer Bear Probably Lost.
San Francisco, June 16. Forty-two
passengers and crew of the steamer
Lear were unaccounted for in a check
made at Eureka, Cal., last night, near
ly 24 hours after the San Francisco and
Portland steamship company's vessel
had run on the rocks off the Mendocino
coast, northern California, in a dense
log.
Officials of the company expressed
hope last night that the death list
world be limited to the five bodies re
covered by sundown. At that time
there were 134 survivors at Eureka
and 29 at Capetown, 30 miles to the
south. These, with the five known
dead, accounted for 1C8 of the 210 bouIs
aboard the Hear when she struck.
The steamer, a $1,000,000 coastwise
boat, lay high on a rocky beach near
Sugar Loaf reef, swinging in the long
sweets. Her captain, Louis Nopander,
and three members of the crew stayed
aboard until late yesterday. Finally
they threw the ship's dog overboard
with a light line, but lie could not
make the shore. A line fired from the
ship's cannon reached land and a raft
was rigged which carried them ashore.
Fourteen lifeboats got away from the
Bear In good order. Eleven made the
Blunt's reef lightship, four miles
away. Two made land at the mouth
of Bear river, near the wreck, and
one capsized and was lost. Fog and
a strong current were the only reasons
given by the ship's officers for tho
tragedy.
Patrols of ranchmen rode the rocky
beaches and headlands last nig'.it
watching for bodies to come ashore.
The lifeboat which upset was not far
from land when the waves caught, it
and the chances were considered good
that other bodies would drift in, or
that a fev more survivors might be
found aloiiL? Uio deserted coast.
The plight of many of those who
came ashore Wednesday nigiil near
Capetown, was pitiable. Half-dressed
and chilled through, they burrowed
into the cold sand, hoping for warmth.
The people of Capetown rescued them
from their sandholes at dawn.
Those boats which followed orders
and made the lightship fared better.
The steamer Grace Dollar and the tug
Relief took ;hem off and brought them
to Eureka, where they were given at

hausted illiam J. Bryan Given Privileges of the
Convention to Speak in Favor of the Candidate
and His Policies
Ccliseun, St. Louis, June 15. PresI-1
ent Wilson and Vice President Mar-
hall were nominated by acclamation
tonight by the Democratic national cou
ventfon, the ticket being completed
four minutes before Friday.
Contrary to expectations, however,
the convention did not finish its work
because the platform was not ready
and it will meet again at 11 o'clock Fri
day morning.
It was announced in the convention
that the sub-committee drafting the
platform had finished it, but that the
entile resolutions committee was not
not assembled to pass upon it and it
was not known when that could be
done. President Wilson's plunk
barging conspiracy among some for
eign born citizens for the benefit of
foreign powers and denouncing any
political party which benefits by and
does not repudiate such a situation
was incorporated in the platform just
as the President had sent it from
Washington. It was understood that
the President insisted that the plank
should be put in the platform in the
way he had drawn it.
There never was any doubt of Pres
ident Wilson's nomination tonight,
but there was a possibility that some
vice presidential booms might be
brought out in opposition to Vice
President Marshall. They melted
away, however, when the convention
got In session and as soon as Presi
dent Wilson's nomination had been
made by a roaring chorus of accla
mation. Senator Kern, who renomi
nated Mr. Marshall, cast aside a long
prepared speech and simply declared:
"I nominate Thomas Riley Marshall
of Indiana for vice-president."
To President Wilson's nomination
there was only one dissenting vote,
Robert Kmniett Burke of Illinois,
who tame to the convention announce-
ing that he was opposed to the l'resi
dent. His vote technically made the
President's nomination l.OHl to 1.
The convention rceonvced shortly
after 9 o'clock tonlttht with the an
nounced purpose of remaining in con
tinuous session until it had renomi
nated President Wilson and Vice
President Marshall, adopted a plat
form and transacted all other bus!
ness that brought the representatives
of the party to St. Ixmis.
Stirred by the speeches by the tern
porary and permanent chairmen, both
making President Wilson's peaceful
conduct of the country's foreign rela
tions the keynote, the convention only
awaited the moment of balloting , to
renominate Wilson and Marshall with
the slogan of pence, preparedness and
prosperity.
The resolutions committee nut in
final session tonight to pass upon tho
plafoim. A tentative draft worked on
by a subcommittee of nine, was laid
before the full committee for approval
The draft was about 4.000 words In
length and contained about twenty-five
planks, including those on American
Ism, with a denunciation of foreign
born citizens who conspire to influen
the International and domectic policies
of the United States; tariff, prepared
ness nnd woman suffrage.
Tho platform carried the American
ism plank as outlined by the Presi
dent. It endorsed his conduct of for
eign affairs nnd followed his recom
mendations regarding the attitude of
this country toward foreign powers,
except that the committee udib-d n

Planks were inserted Bupponlr.g the
legislative program of the adinlnlstra-
tion.
There was complete compliance In
the draft with nil the requests of the
representatives of organized labor.
Before the convention was called to
order the Coliseum was so full that
the fire department took charge of
the entrances nnd permitted no more
(0 come In. William J. Bryan, how
ever, managed to get by and got his
usual uproarious reception as he took
his seat.
The crowd yielded fo the nipping of
the gavel long enough to hear the
- ' prayer and then renewed Its demands
1
for a speech from Bryan.
Senator James Introduced Mr. Bryan
ns "one of the leading citizens of the
world nnd America's greatest Demo
nf - ! crat "
Then the roll of the slates was called
for nominations. Alabama yielded to
New Jersey nnd Judge John W. Wes-
cott nominated President Wilson.
As Judge Westcott dosed with a
mention of the name "Woodrow Wil
son" the crowd broke into a great
demonstration. Moving picture flash
lights blazed and flags were paraded
In front of the stand. The band play
ed "The Star Spangled Banner" while
a huge banner bearing the President's
likeness was unfurled from the root
of the hall.
The delegates began a parade bear
ing state stanchions. The crowds on
the floor and balconies rose to its feet.
Many delegates stood on their chairs.
"Dixie" and other melodies by tho
band evoked fresh bursts of cheering.
Chaiiman James yielded the chair
during the demonstration to Repre
sentative Heflen of Alabama. Women
delegates were among the paraders
in the aisles. Senators and represen
tatives helped carry banners.
Sergeant-at-arms Martin stirred up
the enthusiasm by waving the Texas
"Lone Star" flag, handed over the
head3 of the crowd from the chair
man's rostrum. Other state flags were
taken to the platform.
The crowd joined in singing a med
ley including "How Dry I Am," "Old
Black Joe." "The Red, White and
Blue," and others.
After the demonstration had been
under way thirty minutes New York
and some of the other delegates re
sumed their seats. Waving a cane
over the rail at the chairman's desk
Senator Hughes renewed the clamor
by leading three cheers for the Presi
dent. Some of the delegates stopped dem
onstrating long enough to drain pop
bottles and then went back at it again.
The band was so vigorous keeping
up the din that the musicians went
short of breath so they laid back and
let the bass drummer perform alone
for a while. He belabored his drum
industrially, until the bandsmen got
their second wind and then went back:
to "Tipperary."
On motion of Senator Hughes of
New Jersey, the rules were suspended
and no ballots whatever were taken.
The delegates simply roared "Aye"
when the names of Wilson nnd Marsh
all weie called and Chairman James
declared them nominated by acclama
tion. Robert Emmet Burke of Illinois, a
delegate who nnnounced ho would not
vote for the President, rUed the only
voice in opposition. He was elected as
an independent.
Many delegates and spectators made
a rush for the exits when the vlco
presidential nomination was mado and
in the confusion Senator James with
great difficulty restored order.
