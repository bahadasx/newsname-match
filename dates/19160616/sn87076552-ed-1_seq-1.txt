REPUBLICAN STANDARD BEARERS
Under the American flasr: in the ' crawling, creeping, striking at every
twentieth century and within thirty i movement at last exhausted and half
minutes walk from the, heart of the
city ol Manila, the capital of the i'hii
Ippine Islands, occurs yearly, a pe
culiar religious ceremony performed
by the natives, which tends to rival
the ancient rites and ceremonies of
the sun worshippers of New Mexico
and Arizona and reads like a page
from out of the past, teeming with
deligious fanaticism and barbaric
savagery.
At the foot of a low hill beneath
the spreading trees, past which mur
murs a pretty crystal brook on its
journey to the great ocean, is erected
a small shrine, covered , with make
shift tent of hemp cloth and sacking.
- Decorated in multi-colored festoons of
leaves and branches. This is the place
ol worship,
i With the break of day comes the
pilgrims, silently they come from out
of the hills and neighboring "barrios"
(villages.) The crowd thickens as
they gather upon the hill side and be
gin preparations for the ceremony,
which is known throughout the land
as "Siete Palabras" (Seven Words)
relative to the last words spoken by
Chrsit upon the cross. (See note 4.)
The worshipers, all men, begin by
divesting themselves of all clothing
excepting a loin cloth. Binding their
nether limbs with strong rope, pass
ing tightly round and round. Cover
ing their faces with a cloth, they
proceed to the top of the hill. (See
note 3.)
Two women take their places with
in the tent beside the shrine and be
gin a chant, which continues through
. out the day without interruption.
The devotees in order to reach the
proper degree of exultation commence
$y, turning a series of hand-springs or
cart-wheels down the hill side, rolling
over from side to side always to
wards the shrine. Rapidly at first, los
ing momentum as they proceed down
over the rough ground, brusing them
selves at each turn. After what seems
to be an hour or more, but which is in
reality ten or fifteen minutes, the
worshipers now well worn out from
their strenuous exercise and the heat
of the tropical sun which beats down
upon them without mercy, kneel be
fore the shrine and with bowed heads
receive a crown of thorns.
Taking up a lash, constructed . of
ten or twelve thongs, each finished
with pieces of wood or metal not un
like the cat-o-nine-tails they again
take station on the hill side. Placing
one arm across their breast, the other
grasping the lash they move forward,
at each step swinging the lash from
side to side in such a manner that
the ends of the lash fall upon their,
bared backs, raising a welt at each
stroke. Slowly they proceed down
the hill side, striking to right and
to left in sickening, rythmical preci
sion. Half of the distance is now
covered, when through weakness caus
ed by the incessant beating and the
severe heat, they fall prostrate upon
their faces.
A man fully garbed and armed with
a short stick, on one end is fastened
a flat piece of wax in which are im
bedded Dieces of broken glass, now
aDoroaches. striking fiercely at the
ud turned backs of the worshipers as
they lie upon the ground. Ten or
twelve blows from this instrument of
torture is usually sufficient to cause
the blood to flow freely from their
now swollen and discolored sides.
The worshiper rises, now insensible
tn nain. resumes the flogging with
renewed vigor, moving ever forward

Friends now take mm in hand, half
carrying, half dragging him to the
creek where he is washed, cleansed
and bandaged, his penitence is' o'er his
promise fulfilled, his sacrifice complete
The whole ceremony is a crude rer
presentation of the journey of Christ
to Calvary. Each one trying, as far
as their knowled'ge permits to suffer
as Jesus had done for them that they
might be saved.
The custom dates far back into
Spanish times and one can only re
late so much of it as has been handed
down from father to son. It is the
workings of a peculiar religious sect
and takes place annually on Holy
Thursday and Good Friday. Although
this savage form of purification and
memorial is practiced extensively
throughout the Philippine Islands it
is seldom seen outside of the hills
where the adherents worship, driven
there by civilization.
In direct contradiction to the gen
eral belief that this custom is sanc
tioned and brought about by the
Catholic Church, the major portion of
these fanatics are recruited from the
"taos" or peasantry laborers and toil
ers of the fields and mountains who
are constantly reaching out their un
clean hands for money, the price of
the privilege to worship God. lhese
people believe in direct communion
with God receiving His blessing and
forgiveness without the aid of a mid
dleman (the priest) who needs must
be remumerated for his part in the ser
vice. In the early days these fana
tics did receive the sanction of native
priests who told them that if they
wanted to seek penitence in such a
manner, they must go to the moun
tains. Gradually this sect drifted
farther and farther away following
blindly the teachings of their own
leaders until at the present time there
is no connection between the fanatics
and the church.
In conversation with one of the
members of this sect, I learned that
upon recovery from some serious ill
ness one promises to God to observe
this form of penitence for a certain
period of years, according to the na
ture and seriousness of his illness. In
this particular instance, this man had
only a few years previously been
stricken down with cholera and he
vowed to God that were his life spar
ed he would for ten years go through
this ordeal. He further stated that he
had never suffered any inconvenience
from the sacrifice and that after three
days the .wounds would heal with noth
ing but livid scars to tell the tale,
which are -pointed to with pride by
the wearer. He naa received uoa s i was a
Perhaps there are citizens of Ful
ton county who are unaware that the
largest Arbor of the Ancient Order
of Gleaners in the State of Ohio is
located at Ottokee in Fulton county.
This Arbor of about 200 members
held their annual Memorial Service
last Sunday in the Methodist church
at that place. The. church was well
filled and the program consisting of
songs, readings and recitations was
very appropriate and very beautiful.
The leading feature of the program
was a memorial prepared and read by
H. H. Hough of Wauseon who is a
member of the Ottokee Arbor and al
so a Supreme officer of the Order
serving as an organizer in the State
of Ohio. Mr. Hough's memorial is
printed in full herewith. F. E. Ken
yon gave a memorial address and the
graves of departed companions were
decorated with floral emblems of the
Order.

SPEND SUMMER ON VOLCANO.
To study the return of plant life on
an Alaskan volcano, Prof. Robert F.
Griggs of the department of botany
of The Ohio State University, accom
panied by his family, left recently for
Mt. Katmai, a volcano near the west
ern coast of Alaska," The eruption of
the volcano four years ago destroyed
every vestige of plant life in the vi
cinity. After landing in a small boat, the
party will explore up to the crater.
For supplies they will be dependent
upon a small base-which will be ex
posed to chance-marauders. - Water
will be scarce, obtainable only in a
thick, gritty form; strained from pum
ice and ash.

Wauseon Booster's Club Sold Annual
Meeting Officers Chosen Move
ment To Organize Company of Na

Endorsement. "
Responding to the call published in
the newspapers last week av number
of those interested in the organiza
tion of a company of National Guards
in Wauseon met with the Boosters
Club last Monday night at T. & I.
Hall. Vice President Wager of the
Club called the meeting to order and
announced that the meeting would be
in charge of J. F. Outcalt f or the pur
pose of presenting the matter of a
military organization. Mr. Outcalt
explained conditions which obtain in
the Sixth Regiment O. N. G. at the
present time which makes it possible
for Colonel Howard to place an in
fantry company in some town outside
of Toledo. Mr. Outcalt detailed the
advantages of a miltary company to
the town and to the indvidual mem
bers 'of sueh an organization. Ser
geant Figgy of the Ambulance Com
pany of the Sixth Regiment also spoke
of the advantages accruing to mem'
bers of the National Guards.
The recent act of Congress gives to
all National Guardsmen one fourth
the pay of men enlisted in the regular
army during times of peace and full
pay for any actual service, a num
ber of others spoke and Mr. Outcalt
presented a blank- petition to Gover
nor Willis with the statement that if
the petition was signed by fifty men
who would pledge tnemseives to enlist-
in a company to be organized in
Wauseon he was sure that the Gover
nor would authorize Colonel Howard
to establish a company in this place.
Mr. Outcalt stated that the endorse
ment and co-operation of the Boosters
Club was desired and would be much
appreciated.
At the conclusion oi tne conierence
in regard to the militia company, the
Club was again called to order by
Vice President Guilford and the report
of the Secretary for the year just
closed was read, approved and order
ed placed on file. The report showed
that the Club closed the year with a
good balance on hand. A motion pre
vailed that the Boosters Club heartily
endorse the movement to establish a
company of National Guards in Wau
seon and that a committee of six be
appointed to co-operate 1 with those
who are interested in the matter.
The chair later announced the
names of Messrs. Wager,. Fred Funk
houser, C. P. Grisier, F. E. Kenyon,
Henry Williams and Dr. C. F. Hart
mari to constitute such committee.
Messrs. Kenyon, Scott and Schlatter
were appointed a nominating commit
tee; this committee nominated the fol

elected by the Club to serve for the
year ending June 1st, 1917: President,
