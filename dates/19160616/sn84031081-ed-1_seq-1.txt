would have scaled death at the Amer
ican fireside. It would have dcatroyed
our prosperity and added hundreds of
millions of taxation to the burdens of
the nation. It would have planted
distrust and haired of the Culled
States In every Soulh American re
public. It would have forfeited the
repcet of the world. It would have
substituted the tenets of imperialism
for tne principles of Americanism.
It would have prostituted the bravery
and patriotism of American arms to
the greed and avarice of concession
aries. It would have robbed the Cnlt

sion amongst the nations of the earth.
It would have made mlht right und

and denied the right of fifteen million-
of people to govern themselves.

The achievements of the
Wilson
administration In enacting beneficial
logi-datbm and in keeping the coun
'try at peace without sacrifice of the
national honor, were pronounced
epoch-making in American history by
Senator James.
"During three years of its national
control," an id Senator James,
"democracy has enacted into law
more progressive remedial legislation
Ithafthe nation haa ever written upon
jits statute books since its birth. In
former national contest in the last
I two decades, our party came ns a
; prophet. Today we come with deeds,
not words: with performance, not
promise. The democratic party has
I kept its word with tho American peo
jple. We have made good."

( The chairman reviewed at length
jthe legislative, record of the admlnls
Itration and euloglised the president

'The democrats, he said, had enacted
la tariff law under which monopolies

curbed, and unexampled proa-
'perity attained; n banking law taking
ithe money control out of the hands of
an oligarchy, and making panics no
(longer possible, and many reform
