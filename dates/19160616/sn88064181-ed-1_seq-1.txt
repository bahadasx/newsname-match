of New York.
For vice president: Charles W.
Fairbanks of Indiana.
Progressive Ticket
For president: Theodore Roosevelt
of New York.
For vice president: John M. Park
er of Louisiana.
Chicago.-Charles E. Hughes of
New York and Charles Warren Fair
banks of Indiana are the nominees
of the Republican party according to
the verdict of the delegates in con
Vention assembled in this city on Sat
urday. Hughes was named on the
third ballot and the voting was halted
to make the nomination unanimous be
fore half of the states had been polled.
Fairbanks was selected as the run
ning mate on the first ballot. His
name was placed in nomination by
John Wanamaker of Philadelphia.
Almost at the same time Theodore
Roosevelt was unanimously named as
the Progressive candidate for presi
dent at the "Bull Moose" convention
a few blocks away. For two days
George W. Perkins and other Progres
sive leaders held the delegates in
check, hoping that a compromise can
didate might be agreed upon by the
two parties, but they would no longer
be stayed when it was seen that the
nomination of Hughes was to be ef
fected by the Republicans. John M.
Parker of.Louisiana was named as the
candidate for vice president.
The naming of the associate justice
of the Supreme court of the United
States was the signal for a wild out
burst of cheering in the Coliseum
the scene of many demonstrations dur
ing the convention. Likewise the nam
ing of the "big chief" of the Progres
stives permitted his followers to let
loose their pent-up enthusiasm that
fairly rocked the Auditorium.
Named on Third Ballot.
Two unsuccessful ballots were taken
by the Republican detagates before
they adjourned Friday night When
the donvention met at noon Saturday
indications pointed to the naming of
the New York man and the vote was
overhelmingly Hughes from the mo
ment the first state-Alabama-was
called upon. He was given 949',;
Roosevelt, 18%; DuPont, 5; Weeks,
3; Lodge, 7, and LaFollette, 3. Only
494 votes were necessary for the nomi
nation.
Compromise Candidate Refused.
The nomination of Hughes came af
ter the Republicans turned down the
proposal of Col. Theodore Roosevelt
that United States Senator Henry Ca
bot Lodge of Massachusetts be named
as a c,)rlpromise candidate.
The action of the Progressives in
tabling the suggestion of their leader
was read before the Republican dele
gates and Chairman Harding an
nounced that the message would be
recorded in the proceedings of the
corcention.
Roosevelt in a telegram to the Pro
gressive convention received in the
morning suggested the name of Sena
tor Lodge as a compromise candidate
upon whom both Progressives and Re
publicans could unite.
N Mr. Roosevelt said that at about five
he was notified by the Progressive
conferees that they had come to no
ta conclusion with the Reppblican con
ferees and that the Republican con
ferees had again asked for any sug
gestion of a name as a candidate from
the Progressive conferees.
He then wrote to the Progressive
conferees stating that he deeply ap
preciated their loyalty to him and
their efYorts to get him nominated, but
I that he thought the time had come
when carrying out the spirit of the
statement of the Progressive national
committee in January and the state
ment made by him in Trinidad in
February, it was their duty to present
an alternative name on which he
hoped the Republicans and Progres
sives could unite. He presented the
name of Henry Cabot Lodge. He
quoted the three paragraphs of his
telegram to W. B. Jackson of Ma
land.
He stated that Mr. Lodg ,d
- maember ýthf44oweor9
gress and of the senate of the United
States for thirty years; that he was a
man of the highest integrity, great far
sightedness, and of wide vision as to
national needs, and qualified in every
way for the high office of president.
The Republican convention opened
at the Coliseum at 11 a. m., June 7.
Senator Warren G. Harding of Ohio
was elected temporary chairman, and
3 he delivered a speech setting forth
conservative Republican principles.
Following this the regular committees
3 were appointed and organized and rou
Itine convention business yent for
ward. There was only moderate ex
pression of enthusiasm at any time.
With the hope of agreeing an a presi
dential candidate whom both parties
might support, the Progressives, in
convention at the Auditorium, and the
3 Republicans appointed a joint confer
ence committee Thursday, and this
committee met at the Chicago club.
Shortly after midnight it was an
nounced that no progress had been
made toward fusion of the two parties.
The RepUblican members of this
committee were Senator Reed Smoot
of Utah. W. Murray Crane, ex-senator
from Massachusetts; Senator William
E. Borah of Idaho, Nicholas Murray
'utler of New York, president of Co
lumbia university; A. R. Johnson of
Ohio, a former congressman. The Pro
gressive members were Gov. Hiram
Johnson of California, Horace S. Wil
kinson of New York, Charles J. Bona
parte of Maryland, former attorney
general, John M. Parker of Louisiana,
George W. Perkins of New York.
Nominating speeches began in the
Jepublican convention about three
o'clock Friday afternoon, and nomina
tions were closed before eight o'clock.
Balloting began at once. Two ballots
were taken before adjournment for the
night.
The Progressive convention opened
at exactly the same time the Republi
cans started their meeting. Tempo
rary Chairman Raymond Robins deliv
ered the Progressive policy speech.
Routine business followed-but it
wasn't routine in the same way as the
Republican session was. The Progres
sives, with such men as William Allen
White, Victor Murdock and Hiram
Johnson, were loudly enthusiastic.
This convention was really an explo
slve affair-cheers, table pounding,
radical talk and all that.
It is said that George W. Perkins
and some others of the Progressive
group had a hard time keeping the
radical element from nominating
Colonel Roosevelt shortly after the
show started. The conservatives lived
in the hope of a fusion with the Re
publicans. The radicals said they
didn't care what the Republicans did.
They wanted "Teddy," and they want
ed him quick. There was no 4 Oker'
ars spirit is these fellows.
