ESTABLISHED 1845.
Greeted By Tumultuous Ap?
plause in Democratic National
Convention at St. Louis
St. Louis, Mo., Juno 14.?The De?
mocratic National Convention, at its
first Boston today heard the keynote of
Americanism and peace, preparedness
and prosperity, sounded by former
Governor Glynn, of .New York, as
temporary chairman, and with a high
pitch of enthusiasm, emphatically
registered by demonstration, its ap?
proval of President Wilson's peaceful
conduct of foreign affairs.
The convention which hod gotten
under way with such perfunctory de?
monstrations as mark every national
gathering of the kind soon stirred
into roaring cheers as Chairman Glynn
cited historic parallels to show thai
other presidents, including Republi?
cans, had adjusted threatening for?
eign situations wit hunt resort to war.
Policy is American.
"The policy of the administration,"
he declared, "has been just as Ameri?
can as the American flag itself."
As he went down the list of presi?
dents, recounting their action to avoid
war, the delegates caught, the spirit of
his argument and as he referred to
each particular preside-ill some dele?
gate would call:
"What did he do?"
"lie settled the trouble by negotia?
tion," was the reply which Glynn in
varably returned und the convention
would roar its approval.
William .). Bryan, as a newspaper
correspondent in the press stand, wepl
with emotion as Glynn pictured the
victories of peace, but he laughed with
the crowd when a Texas delegate in?
terrupting Glynn leaped to his chair
and cried: i
"And don't finget that policy also
is satisfactory to William .Jennings
Bryan."
Aside from a sixlcen-minutc demon
Btration, which began when Chairman
Glynn presented President Wilson's
reelection, Clynn's speech was sprink?
led with demonstrations which he
found it difficult to stem so ho could
go it. It was plain that the telling
points on the delegates were the re?
cital of President Wilson's effort to
keep the country at peace.
"This policy," he said "may not
satisfy the lire eater and swash buck?
ler, but it does satisfy the mothers of
the land at. whose heart and fireside
jingoistic war has placed an empty
chair. It does satisfy the daught?
ers of this land from whom bluster
and brag have sent the loving brother
to the dissolution of the grave. li
tloes satisfy the fathers of this land
and the sons of this land who wit!
light for our dag and die for our Hag
when reason primes the ride; when
honor draws the sword anil when jus?
tice breathes a blessing on the stand?
ard they uphold."
The last of the words were drowned
out in a roar of applause that swept
the Coliseum.
"Repeat, it," cried the delegates,
"repeat it."
"All right, be quiet ami I'll repeat
it," responded Glynn and In- did, to
apnlaiisc and cheering.
X(> other president since the civil
war, Glynn told the convention, bad
faced such crucial problems, none hnd
displayed a grasp of statesmanship
more profound.
"Whethe the course the country
has pursued during this crucial period
is to be continued and whether the
principles that have been asserted as
our national policy shall be endorsed
oi- withdrawn," Clynn told the con?
vention, was the paramount question
for the voters to decide.
"NTo lesser issue must cloud it,"
said ho. "no unrelated problems must
confuse it."
ATTACKED j)f_ GOVERNOR
Hatfield Assaults His Old Friend
Isaac T. Mann Who Supported
Him For Office.
Senator W. P. Hawloy, of BluefUcd,
who was a delegate from West Vir?
ginia to the Republican convention,
was here on business Wednesday. .Mr.
Haivley was a witness to the "vicious
assault made by Governor Hatfield of
West Virginia on Isaac T. Mann, the
well known coal operator. The at?
tack occurred on the floor of the Re?
publican convention, and for some?
time it was thought, that Mr. Mann
was seriously injured. The newspa?
pers of Chicago, Philadelphia and
other cities denounced the assault as
cowardly and unprovoked.
Mr. Mann was formerly a strong
supporter of the West Virginia Gov?
ernor.

BEAR SEEN IM ABB S VALLEY
Old Bruin's Tracks Visible at
Many Places?on Way to
Famous Hear Grounds.
John W. Buchanan was here on
Wednesday, and dropped in long
enough to shake hands, and to report
great excitement in his community
not far from Pocahontas, occasioned
by the presence of a big bear in their
midst. Bruin came out of West Vir?
ginia, and was headed southeast, tow?
ard the old hunting ground of J. Floyd
j Gillcspic, evidently looking for
trouble.
It is said that men, hoys, women
and children all joined in the chase
as the bear passed through Abb's
V*allcv. all anxious of course to "get
:'.t him," but prepared to climb a tree
at a moment's warning.
Somebody in this town who heard
John Buchanan telling this bear story,
said that if John went after that bear
there woultl be a reptition of a story
Cold of an Eastern Virginia gentleman
some years ago, who, hearing of n
..ear in the community, shouldered
?us gun and went in search of bruin,
in the course of an hour or two his
wife.was surprised to see him dashing
through the lields for home at a
_':-10 gait. As soon as he got his
breath his better half inquired the
^rouble, and his reply was that "the
i trail was gcttin' too darned hoit."
THE CROPS IN THE EAST.
Viewed from the car windows and
private conveyances along the coun?
ty roads, the crops make a line show?
ing. There was lack of rain during
May, but the recent rains have
brought out the crops wonderfully.
East of the Blue Ridge the crops tire
ahead in growth and size of plants.
Wheat is gootl?much of it ready to
harvest. Many fine patches and some
large lields of alfalfa are seen from
Roanoke county to Richmond, and
around Richmond. One cutting has
been made already and the second
crop will be cut towards the last of
the month. The finest meadows seen
was one on Hollins' College farm.
There was about equal quantities of
alfalfa, red clover and timothy, and
the growth was very heavy. The
growing of alfalfa is becoming more
general each year. It is estimated that
there are now something near 8000
acres in the State. August and Sep?
tember are the best months in which
to sow. Every farmer should grow
an acre or two of this "queen of the
clovers."
LIE ICS MARYLAND HOME.
Simon Keely and Family Are Well
Situated in New Home.
Glenwood, Md., June 21.
Dear Sir: I enclose subscription.
We are very well satisfied in our
Maryland home. We live in an up
to-date neighborhood and have a fine
lot of people for neighbors. Most of
them live in splendid homes and their
sons and daughters are well educat?
ed and refined. We have a county
club in sight of our home, where the
older members of the families meet
every week or two and have their sup
olics, such as machinery, fertilizer,
grass seeds, etc., ordered at wholesale
prices, and the young people meet
there almost every week for some so?
cial function.
I have forty acres in wheat this
year and thirty-three acres in corn
both of which are looking well. A
yield of forty bushels of wheat to the
acre is not uncommon in this com?
munity, and a good many farmers
here produce over seventy-five bush?
els of corn to the acre.
With kind regards for you, Mr.
Editor, and for my many friends in
Tnzowell, I remain,
Yours very turly,
SIMON KELLY.

State Fair Association Issues
List of Prizes For Best Farm
and Single Exhibits at Com?
ing M-2Ct.
I The following loiter sent out by the
i Virginia Suite Fair Association should
lie of interest to the people of Ta.:o
wei':
Ti e Virginia Slate Fair Associa?
tion announces that it has decided, in
Iorder to stimulate und insure County
, Exhibits of the highes; character, to
I offer the following large prizes for
1 bu< h exhibits:
1st. prisso.$500.00
2nd prize. 400.00
3rd prize.300.00
4th prize. 200.00
5th prize. 100.00
Experience has proven that County
Exhibits are among the most at?
tractive features of the Fair. These
exhibits were first made live years
ago under the auspices of the Dem?
onstration Bureau of the Stnle in I
connection with the Department of
Agriculture at Washington. The tirsl
wear only ten counties exhibited. Since
then the exhibits have grown in num?
ber and in excellency until last year
fifty-two counties made complete ex?
hibits of farm products. Tin:, year,
on account of a ruling of the i'<
partmcnt of Agriculture, its agents
and demonstrators will not he allow?
ed to make exhibits at the fair. The
Fair Association, however, hits asked
the Demonstration Bureau to lend its
assistance to counties desiring to
make exhibits in collecting and pre?
paring the same and the Bureau has
graciously expressed its willingness
to do everything in its power to aid
in this connection.
in addition to the prizes offered for
COUIlty exhibits, the Fair has decided
to offer the following for single farm
exhibits:
1st prize.$200.00
2nd prize. 150.00
3rd prize. 100.00
-Ith prize. 75.00
5th prize. 50.00
It will he seen that these prizes are
of sufficient amount, to make it worth
the while of any farmer to make
such preparation as is necessary to
make the host exhibit possible in the
lines in which he excels.
The Fair Association with just,
pride calls attention to the fact thai,
great scope and usefulness attained
bv the State Fair, contributed the
sum of three thousand dollars a year
for two years to the Fair to he used
in prizes to he offered in the name of
the State in agriculture, horticulture,
cattle, sheep and poultry industry.
This makes the Fair in name as well
as in fact the State Fair of Virginia
and prizes and awards coming from
this .source will distinguish the person
receiving them as the holder of priz?
es and awards given by the Slate of
Virginia.
Your participation is earnestly re?
quested. The Fair holds itself ready
to furnish you any informal ion you
may desire in preparing and entering
for the above prizes and generally lo
co-operate with you ofr mutual wel- '
faro and success.

STRANGE PREMONITIONS.
Confederate Soldier "Knew" lie
Would 15c Shot Through
The Head.
liming the winter of 1801, we were
in camp at Manas, as junction. My
bedfellow was Jim Winston, and a
splendid specimen be was - a lawyer
and a University man. lie told me
that be would be killed, anil thai be
would be shot through the head. In
18112, at Chant illy, almost in sight, of
Washington city, be was shot, through
the head and killed. Kit Wnlthllll was
one of mv mess. He also tidd me that
he would be shot through the head
and killed. In the Shenandoab Valley
in 1804, be was killed in battle, the
ball passing through his bead. About
the first or May. 18(11, we were in
Orange county, on the Uapidan river.
A German, one of my company, came
into my tent, lie was a great, reader,
nervous, and high strung. I said to
him that, in a few davs many of us
who were there would be wounded in
battle, possibly lose a limb or be kill?
ed, and under the sod. lie answered
thai, he knew he would not. be killed.
I told him it was something he could
not know; that the first cannon ball
that enmc over, so far as be knew,
might take his head oft*. To that, he
said that if he did not. absolutely
know that, he would not. be killed,
be would go down that night, cross
the river, and never slop until he had
reached Holstein, in Germany, his na?
tive country. I told him he was no
prophet, nor son of a prophet, and
could not know, lie answered that, he
did know that he would not be kill?
ed, thai he was iroinjr to be wounded,
wounded in the leg. Then I told him
(hat I had as much as 1 could stand,
an d he had better leave. All this he
told to the wdiole company.
On the fifth day of May, I sr. 1, the
lighting began. Every morning the
boys would say, "Schacht, is this the
day you are going to be wounded in
the leg?" He answered, "No, this is
not. the day." This passed under mv
eye until the 12th of May. On that
day I was shot down and carried
away. The boys told me this went
on until the l'.lth of May. On that,
morning they again asked, "Schacht,
is this the day you are going to be
shot?" II?' said, "Yes, this is the
day." They were then near tho road
thai leads from Frcdcrickshurg to
Spoltsylvania C. II. That morning a
skirmish line was thrown out, but
not a Yankee could be found any
where. Thcntho boys looted and they
howled, and Schacht called their at?
tention to the fact that Hie day had
not. yet ended, bate, in the day they
again marched through the fields and
pines. Just, before sundown they ran
against, reinforcements coming to
(Irani. A sharp light resulted, and
Schacht was shot through the leg.
Again, late in the summer, he was
shot through tin- leg. After the war,
he lived in Louisa county.
I have given you the facts known
to many men. Will the fellows wdio
know everything please explain the
bow, the why, the wherefore. i

Recent Issue By JeiTersonville
and Clear Fork Bring Premium
of Two and Half For Cent
The Taxewell County ron?l bonds,
amounting lo $25I,SHH), recently voted
by Jctlersonvilte ulitl Clear Kork dis?
tricts, were sold TueiHiiiy to the bond
bouse of J, C. Mayer <V Co., of l'in -
cinnatii at a premium of two nnd one
hatf iterconl. The premium on thu
beads will amount to $0,207.50, mak?
ing n total of $258,107, which will be
available for road purposes.
The impression, gathered from thos-j
famili?r with bond sales, etc., is that
the Supervisors acted wisely and
iirove a line bargain lor the county,
as there is practically no expense at
ail conenctetl with the sale, whereas
in disposing ol the previous bonds,
a large sum of money was Itccessill'il)
expended for advertising, litho?
graphing;, etc. It is said that the
?noney will be available by Iho llrst
of (hi- month. Mr. C. II. Ireland, an
agent of Mayer & Co., was present
and represented the purchasers of the
bonds.
The liest of the bonds will mature
in live years and will run for a per?
iod of thirty years from that tune, and
will conform to the first issue.
County load engineer Martin is
getting his forces, supplies, etc., in
good shape for beginning work on or
about the first of July.

DOES PUBLIC WANT TRUTH?
Indiana Editor Decided in t{uit Lying
?The Result.
The following, cut il led "Telling the
Truth," is taken from the Sugitrcrouk
Weekly Budget, an Ohio publication:
It is not. pleasant and profitable al?
ways to tell the truth in the columns
of n newspaper. Men who have tried
this heretofore always have come to
grief. Only a few days ago the
etil lor of a paper in Indiana grew tir?
ed of being called a liar, and an?
nounced he would tell the truth In
the future. The next, issue of the
paper contained the following items:
"John Boitin, Hie laziest merchant
in town, made a trip to Rclleville
yesterday.
"John Coyle, our grocer mau, is
lining a poor business. His store is
dirty ami dusty. How can he tlo
much'.'
"Tin.' Itov. Styx preached last. Sun?
day night on 'Charity.' Tin sermon
was punk.
"Dave Sonkcy died al his home in
this place. The doctor gave it. out IIS
heart failure. Whiskey killed him.
"Married?Miss Sylvan Rhodes anil
James Colin, last Saturday, al. the
Bnptist parsonage. The bride is a
very ordinary town girl, who doesn't
know any more about, cooking than a
rabbit, and never helped her moth?
er three days in her life. She is not a
beauty by any means, and has a gait
like a duck. The groom is an up-to
date loafer. He has been living off
the old folks at home all his life, and
is not worth shucks. It will be a hard
life.
"The governor of our great Stute,
a very ordinary man, and who was
elected by accident, was here yester?
day. Be has very few friends here
now. He promised some of the vot?
ers of his precinct a piece of pie in
event of his election, hut had for?
gotten all about if when the time to
hand over the little office rolled
around."
Which reminds us of the Illinois
editor who became tired of wielding
the whitewash in the matter of obit?
uaries, decided to reform ami tell the
truth just once. He commented as
follows upon the death of a citizen:
"Died?John Brown, aged fifty sit
years, six months ami thirteen days.
Deceased was a mild mannered pirate
with a mouth for whiskey. He came
here in the night with another man's
wife and Joined the church the first,
chance. He owes us several dollars
for the paper, a largo meal mill, and
you could hear him pray six blocks,
lie died singing, 'Jesus Paid It All,'
anil we think he is right; he never
paid anything himself. He was buried
in an asbestos casket, and his many
friends threw palm leaf fans in his
grave, as he may need them. His
tombstone will be a favorite resting
place for hootOwls."
POUNDING MILL NOTES
