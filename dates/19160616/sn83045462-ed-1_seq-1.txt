RECORD OF ACHIEVEMENT. !
k ' ?
We indorse the administration of
Woodrow Wilson. It speaks for itself.
It is the best exposition of
sound democratic policy at home
and abroad.
We" challenge comparison of our
record, our keeping of pledges and
our constructive legislation, with
those of any party of any time.
We found our country hampered
by special privilege, a vicious tariff,
obsolete banking laws and an inelastic
currency. Our foreign affairs
were dominated by commercial
interests for their selfish ends. The
republican party, despite repeated
pledges, was impotent to correct
abuses which Tt had fostered. Under
our administration, under a leadership
which has never faltered,
these abuses have been corrected
and our people have been freed
therefrom.
Our archaic banking and currency
system, prolific of po.nic and disaster
under republican administrations?long
the refuge of the money
trust?has been supplanted by the
reaerai reserve act, a true ucmutiatj
of credit under government control,
already proved a financial bul- <
wark in a y^orld crisis, mobilizing: I
our resources, placing: abundant I
credit at the disposal of legitimate ,<
industry, and making: a currency
panic impossible.
We have created a federal trade
commission to accommodate the
perplexing: questions arising: under
the anti-trust laws, so that monopoly
may be strangled at its birth
and legitimate industry encouraged.
Fair competition in business is now
assured.
We have effected an adjustment of
the tariff adequate for revenue under
peace conditions and fair to the consumer
and to the producer. We have
adjusted the burdens of taxation so
that swollen incomes bear their
equitable share. Our revenues have
been sufficient in times of world
stress, and will largely exceed the expenditures
for the current fiscal year.
We have lifted human labor from
the category of commodities, and have
secured to the workingman the right
of voluntary association for his protection
and welfare. We have protected
. the rights of the laborer
against the unwarranted Issuance of
writs of injunction, and have guaranteed
to him the right of trial by Jury
in cases of alleged contempt committed
outside the presence of the
court.
We have advanced the parcel post
to zenuine efficiency, enlarged the
postal savings system, added 10,000
rural delivery routes and extensions,
thus reaching two and one-half millions
additional people. Improved the
postal service in every branch, and
for the first time in our history, placed
the post office system on a self-supporting
basis, with actual surplus in
1913, 1914 and 1916.

ECONOMIC FREEDOM.
> <>
The reforms which were most obviously
needed to clesr swsy privilege,
prevent unfair discrimination
and release the energies of men of all
ranks and advantages, have been effee
tod by recent legislation. We must
now remove, so far as possible, every
remaining element of'unrest and un
-^==s=emocratic
1
certainty from the path of the busi- I
nesB men of America, and secure for
them a continued period of quiet, assured
and confident prosperity.

We affirm our belief In the doctrine
of a tariff for the purpose of providing
sufficient revenue for the operation of
the government economically administered.
and unreservedly indorse the
Underwood tariff law as truly exemplifying
that doctrine. We recognlTA

subject to change to meet changing
conditions in the world's production
and trade. The events of the last
two years have brought about many
momentous changes In some respects
their effects are yet conjectural and
wait to be disclosed, particularly in
regard to our foreign trade
Two years of a war which has
directly involved most of the chief
industrial nations of the world, and
which has indirectly affected the
life and industry of all nations, are
bringing about economic changes
more varied and far-reaching than
the world has ever before experienced.
In order to ascertain Just what those
changes may be the democratic Con- j
gress is providing for a non-partisan ,
tariff commission to make impartial i
and thorough study of every economic
fact that may throw light 1
either upon our past or upon our
future fiscal policy with regard to j
the imposition of taxes on imports
or with' regard to the changed and
changing conditions under which our 1
trade is carried on. We cordially
indorse this timely proposal and de- ,
clare ourselves in sympathy with
the principle and purpose of shap- 1
ing legislation within tFhit " field i
in accordance with clearly estab- ,
lished facts rather than in accord- t
ance with trade demands of selfish j
Interests or upon information pro- j j
vided largely, if not exclusively, by ,
them. (
, > ]
AMERICANISM.
! _ * t
i
The part that the united states
will play in the new day of international
relationships which is now
upon us will depend upon our
preparation and our character.
The democratic party therefore recognizes
the assertion and triumphant
demonstration of the indivisibility
and coherent strength of
the nation, as the supreme issue
of this day. in which the whole
world faces the crisis of manifold
change. It summons all men. of
whatever origin or creed, who would
count themselves Americans, to
join in making clear to all the
world the unity and consequent
power of America. ,
This is an issue of patriotism. To
taint it with partisanship would
be to defile it. In this day of test a
America must show itself, not a na*
tion of partisans, but a nation of
patriots. There is gathered here in
America the best of the blood, the
industry and the genius of the '
whole world, the elements of a ]
great race and a magnificent so- i
ciety to be melted into a mighty
and splendid nation.
Whoever, actuated by t^ie purpose 1
to promote the interest of a for- 1
eign power in disregard of our own 1
country's welfare or to Injure this 1
government in its foreign relations
or cripple or destroy its industries I
at home, and whoever by arousing
prejudices of a racial, religious or
other nature creates discord and
strife among our people so as to <
obstruct the wholesome process of
unification, is faithless to the trust
which the privileges of citizenship
repose in him and disloyal to his
country. 1
We therefore, condemn as subversive
of this nation's unity and
integrity, and as destructive of its 1
welfare, the activities and designs
of every group or organization, po- '
litical or otherwise, that has for its
object the advancement of the interest
of a foreign power, whether
such object is promoted by intimidating
the government, a political L
party, or repfeseatatives of the
?latform.
people, or which is calculated and
tends to divide our people into antagonistic
groups and thus to destroy
that complete agreement and
solidarity of the people and that
Unity of sentiment and national purpose
so essentia! to the perpetuity
of the nation and its free institutions.
We condemn all alliances and combinations
of individuals in>this country,
of whatever nationality or descent.
who agree and conspire together
for the purpose of embarrassing
or weakening our government
or of improperly influencing
or coercing our public representatives
in dealing or negotiating with
any foreign power. We charge that
such conspiracies among: a. limited
number exist and nave been instigated
for the purpose of advancing
the interests of foreign countries to
the prejudice and detriment of our
own country. We condemn any political
party which in view of the
activity of such conspirators surrenders
its integrity or modifies its
policy.
j>
PREPAREDNESS.
? : V
Along with the proof of our character
as a nation must go the proof
of our power to play the part that
legitimately belongs to us. The
people of the United States love
peace. They respect the rights and
covet the friendship of all other nations.
They desire neither any additional
territory nor any advantage
which cannot be peacefully gained 1
by their skill, their industry or
Lheir enterprise, but they insist ?
upon having absohite freedom of na- i
tional life aqd policy, and feel that
they owe it to themselves and to the I
role of spirited independence, which
it is their sole ambition to play, that '
they Should render themselves se- 1
;ure against the hazard of interfer- j
snce from any quarter, and should
be able to protect their rights upon ?
the seas or in any part of the world.
We therefore favor the mainte- ,
nance of an army fully adequate to j
the requirements of order, of safety
ind of the protection of the nation s
rights, the fullest development of
modern methods of seacoast defense
ind the maintenance of an adeluate
reserve of citizens trained to
irms and prepared to safeguard the
people and territory of the United
States against any danger of hostile
Lction which may unexpectedly |
irise, and a fixed policy for the continuous
development of a navy
worthy to support the great naval
traditions of the United States and
fully equal to the international
tasks which the United States hopes
ind expects to take a part in performing.
The plans and enactments
5f the present Congress afTord substantial
proof of our purpose in this
exigent matter.
*
INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS.!
? ? * \
The democratic administration has
throughout the present war scrupulously
and successfully held to the old
paths of neutrality and of the peaceful
pursuit of the legitimate objects of our
national life, which statesmen of all
parties and creeds have prescribed
for themselves in America since
the beginning of our history. But
the circumstances of the last two
years have revealed necessities of
international action which no former
generation can have foreseen. *
We hold that It is the duty of the
United States to use its power not
only to make itself safe at home,
but also to make secure its Just interests
throughout the world, and,
both for this end and in the interest
of humanity, to assist the world
In securing settled peace and jus?
tice.
We believe that every people has
the right to choose the sovereignty
under which it shall live; that the
small states of the world have a
right to enjoy from other nations
the same respect for their sovereignty
and for their territorial integrity
that great and powerful, natlons
expect and insist upon; and

Wholesale Abandonment of Military
Trains and Field Equipment
a Feature of Teutonic
Betreat.
PETROGKAD, via London,
June 16.?The AusTrians have
evacuated Czernowitz, capital of
Bukowina, according to dispatches
to the semi-official Petrograd
news agency from Bukowina
by way of Bucharest.
Before abandoning the city the
Austrian authorities arrested a
number of persons who were
forced to accompany the retreating
troops. The railway rolling
stock was sent to Iiskani and the
tracks about the city were destroyed.
Trainloads of wounded
were dispatched to Dornavatra,
seventy-seven miles southwest of
Czernowitz.
The capture of an additional
ioo officers and 14,000 men was
annouhced today by the war office,
bringing the total to more
than 164,000 who have been taken
by the Russians during the offensive
movement on the Volhynian
and Galician fronts.
Confidence prevails that the
catalogue of the successes won bv
Gens. Brusiloff and Letchitsky is
by no means complete. It is estimated
that the central powers'
losses along the front from the
Pripet to the Rumanian border
now total 300,000, or nearly half
the original effectives.
Great Satisfaction Felt.
Great satisfaction is felt with the repstahlishment
of contact with the Teu
tons along the whole southwestern front,
but attention is chiefly centered upon the
operations for Kovel, Vladimir-Volynski,
Czernowitz and Kolomea. Col. Shumsky,
summarizing the results of the fighting,
makes the deduction from the latest
Russian official statement that the entire
line of the Stripa now is occupied by the
Russians.
Northwest of Buczacz a number of good
roads run westward to the Podgaitse railway,
which is regarded as accounting for
the vigor of the resistance in ?his sector
to the Russian advance. The village of
Kozin, fifteen miles southwest of Dubno. i
captured by the Russians, is on the road
to Brody, which leads thence to Lemberg. i
The precipitancy of the retreat of the
A.ustrians in many sectors is shown by
the fact that the Russians found several
telegraphic and telephonic installations
intact ana now are using mem. ine
cartridges captured in the Stripa trenches :
would have sufficed for the use of the
Austrians in the most intense sort of
Bring for several weeks.
Advance Develops Swiftly.
The Russian advance continues to
develop with a degree of swiftness
which has astonished the country. The
success of the movement thus far is
looked upon as the more remarkable in
view of the strong defenses which had
been erected by the Austrians during
the long period of preparation and
their supposed readiness for resistance
to any manner of assault.
The outstanding features are the
steadily mounting number of prisoners,
augmented by the surrender of large
Austrian units in their entirety; the
wholesale abandonment of military
trains and all sorts of field equipment
in such enormous quantities that they
cannot yet be estimated, and finally, so c
far as is known here, the comparatively^mall
extent of Russian losses.
J?XC3pt in tne cenier 01 me ironi i
which runs from Volhynia to the Rumanian
border, the Austrians have c
been wholly unable to resist the Rus- k
sian drive. In the vicinity of Tarnopol V
the opposing forces are still in deadlock.
but on both flanks, in the Lutsk l
region and in the Dniester sector, the
breach made in the Austrian lines is
widening constantly. g
t
Advance Toward Xovel.
i
In the Lutsk region the Russian t
forces, after piercing the Austrian lines t
jy capturing the fortress, have pro- t
pressed in two diverging directions, to- e
urard Kovel and Vladimir-Volnyski. and J
lave attained the points only twenty
niles from both of these objectives.
It is estimated by Russian officers
hat the Austrians had lost nearly half
:he forces operating on the southwest- i
srn front. i
Much of the effectiveness of the Rustian
artillery in their great Galician 1
lrive is due to the use of big Japanese
juns. These guns are said to b^ more \
powerful than any that the Russians .
lave had heretofore and are charged
with shells filled with a new explosive. 1
