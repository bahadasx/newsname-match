STEAMER SUNK
IN POTOMAC;
SIXTY RESCUED
Wakefield Runs Into Pile in
Starting at Mathias Point
and Goes Down.
SHIPS RUSH TO SAVE HER
All Passengers Reach Land in
Life-Boats After Perilous
Trip in Wind.
Sixty passengers had a narrow
escape last night when the steamer
Wakefield, of the Chesapeake and
Potomac line, sank at Mathias
Point, a landing on the lower Poto
mac. The passengers were rescued by
tho steamer Majestic, which hap
pened to be near at the time the
Wakefield stove a hole in her bow
and began slowly to sink.
The steamer Gratitude was also
rushed to the scene, but all the
passengers had been rescued by
the time she arrived. The crew of
the Gratitude worked for an hour
taking freight from the Wakefield
before that vessel's main deck dis
appeared beneath the surface of
the water.
LIFEBOATS MANNED.
The Wakefield's llfeboata were man
tied when Capt. A. W. Kelly felt the first
Impact caused by tht keel striking the
piling and the passengers were lowered
In safet. They were rowed back to
the Mathias Point wharf, a dlstanco ot
about-. 400 yards and wuited there until
the JInstlo arrived, four hours Inter.
Tho lowering of the llfeboain and res
about 400 yards, and waited thoro until
Ing and hazardous experience, a high
southeast wind raging ut the time mv.l
lashing the -waters or the "Potomac far
up on tho Bides of tho small boats.
The experience of the men. women,
and children In ono of the lifeboats
was made all the morn gruesome be
causo of the presence of n coffin box
In the boat. The box contained tho
body of a colored woman who died In
Washington and whose remains wcro
placed on tho Wakefield yesterday
morning for shipment to Colonial !3"ch.
First Mate John Bacgptt, who was nt
the pilot wheel when the nccldent oc
curred, made a toport to the company
today. He said ho knew the piling was
near the end of the wharf, but the
hlcrh water made It difficult for him to
estimate distances and ho miscalculated
the distance.
The high water covered a number of
wooden piles plarcd at the ond of the
wharf at Mathias Point.
Th Wakefield stopped at Mathias
Pott?) to discharge several passcngors.
The pilot then turned his vessel around
and Marted out toward the river chan
nel to continue bis voyago down tho
river.
A short distance out from the wharf
he headed down stream. Instantly tho
crew and passengers wero horrified by
a prolonged grating' sound and tho
sudden listing of the Wakefield to
ward the starboard side.
The pilot endeavored to back toward
the wharf, but the keel was hold fast
by the piling, which had made a hole
through the plates nt the bow.
Excitement rclKned amontr the wom
en and children passengers, hut their
rears were quieted uy tno orncers who
Immediately ordered tho lifeboats
lowered. With cork llfo belts strap
ped around them, the men, women
and children were quickly escorted
to the life boats and quietly seated.
After a short, but dangerous trip
to the shore the passengers were help
ed up to the wharf and remained
there until the Majestic arrived.
Noting the dlctreis of the Wakefield,
the captain of the Majestic headed
straight for Mathias Point, arriving
there before tho upcrceplng waters had
reached the lower deck of tho wrecked
VMsel.
The passengers and crew of the
Wakefield were token aboard the Ma
jestic In a few mlnutfs and without
mishap. Somo of tho freight and mail
was also taken off by tho Majestic,
which stood by the Wakefield until tho
Gratitude arrived upon tho scene.
No One Injured.
So far as the management of tho
Chesapeake and Potomac Company was
Informed no one was Injured and no
property wan lost. It was said there Is
still somo freight on tho lower deck ot
the Wakefield but It Is believed this can
bt saved when the Wakefield In raised.
The management of the company nn-
nouiiccu ioaay mat as soon as wo nigh
water subsides enough to permit of sal
vago work, cranes and drrlolH would
be sent to Mathlns Point to raise the
Wakefield and repair the damage.
This morning tho stern of tho Wake
field, on which considerable freight was
loaded, was completely under water, tho
smokestack amidships was submerged
all but two feet, whllo tho bow Jutted
tip at an angle of forty-flvo degrees. In
dicating that the stem had settled on
the bottom of the river.
The Wakefield left Washington yes
ferday morning at 8 o'clock, hound for
Colonial Bench and intermediate river
landings. Most of tho passengerH were
residents of the Maryland and Virginia
landings along tho Potomac, whllo a
few were excursionists and vacationists

man of tho executive committee of the Flag Day Preparedness
Parade, warmly praising him and other members of the committee

WELD ORPET LINKS
State Adds to Chain of Evidence
by Which It Hopes to Con
vict Accused Student.
COURTROOM. WAUKFX3AN, III..
June 16. Tho prosecution of Will Orpet
added link after link today to the chain
of circumstantial evidence, which It be
lieves will convict Orpet of Marlon
Lambert's murder.
Step by step It sought to build up,
through tho testimony of poison experts,
a wall which tho defenso m'ust shatter,
perhaps only by the testimony of Orpet
himself.
When court opened today, Assistant
State's Attorney Runyard contended
that these facts had been established
beyond a doubt:
"Cynalde of potassium was admin
istered to Marian In a liquid form. No
container was found near tho body. It
would have been only natural. If Marian
had killed herself, that a bottle would
havo been found near the Three Oaks,
where she waa found dead. We have
shown by analysis of Marian's gloves
and handkerchief that she did not carry
tho poison in either. Now, we will let
tho jury draw Its own deductions as to
what happened to the poison container."
Defense Alms to Shake Story.
Dr. Ralph J. Webster, whoso testi
mony late yesterday was considered tho
strongest evidence for the prosecution,
was cross-examined again by the de
fence. In an effort to shatter his state
ment that science proved Marian's
death due to cyanide in a liquid form,
and not powder, as the defenso has con
tended. Tho "eighteen bunch," a club of girls
who wero Marian's chums, were In tho
courtroom today, waiting for their
chance to testify for the State that
Joscphino Davis, who said Marian waa
despondent a few days before her death,
was mistaken.
The "bunch" was released from the
Deerfleld Township High School today,
most of them by graduation.
Vacant Chairs at Exercises.
The exercises were held last night.
Marian Lambert would havo been grad
uated with them If she had lived. Jo
sephine Davis' chair on tho platform
was vacant, too. She was testifying to
savo Orpet when the final examinations
wero held, and did not graduate.
Tho dofenso has discovered another
witness In Verna Jackson, another girl
chum of Marian's. Verne said today
Marian seemed despondent and sho also
was ready to tell of a mysterious man
sho saw In tho woods beckoning to
Marian, the day she met her death.
This man. she said, waa not Will Orpet.

cluding Senator Hughes of New Jersey,
th Democratic Dlatform as reDortcd by

f us nk which comlts tho party to legls

Tho language of the plank favors "an
equitable retirement law providing for
tut retirement or superannuated and
disabled employes of the civil service to
the end thati a higher standard of effi
ciency may be maintained."
Obcjctions Overcome.
The subject was discussed both In the
subcommittee and in tho main commit
tee on resolutions, Some of tho Demo
cratic leaders were opposed to commit
ting the party to this principle.

It Is well understood that a retirement

The peace dove which hovered
over the proceedings all during the

and Vice President Marshall short
ly before midnight unfolded its
wings and scurried, 5rayarh to
day. An all-night session, during
which the resolutions committee
vainly endeavored to frame a com
promise plank on woman suffrage,
failed to bring out the issue square
ly enough to suit the radical ele
ment, and the fight was opened on
the floor of the convention shortly
after it was called to order.
FIGHT ON INTERVENTION.
Another Issue over which the dele

The light on suffrage lasted five or
six hours. It was between the West

and Senator Plttman led tho fight by a
thorough-going Indorsement.
