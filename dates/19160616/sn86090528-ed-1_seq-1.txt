SCRAP OVER SUFFRAGE
PLANK IS POSSIBLE
Advocates of Votes for Women Demand
'Declaration for Constitutional Amend

Committee
fly United Tress.
St. Louis, June 10. After a night of
harmony which reached its climax ut
midnight, in the renominatiou of Wil
son and Marshall by acclamation, the
Democrats this morning had on hands
( least one fight that seemed likely
lo he carried to the floor of the con
vention. This question was woman suffrage.
The resolutions committee fought for
hours over the proposed suffrage
plank in the platform
A straight declaration in favor of an
amendment to tii federal constitution
rivi'".g women the right to vote was
defeated by a vote of twenty to twen
ty two in the committee and the fol
lowing statement was adopted:
"We recommend the extension of
the franchise to women by the states
upon the same terms as to men."
The suffrage workers regarded this
substitute as unsatisfactory. They
openly declared that they would offer
from the floor a plank that would
commit the party to completo accord
with the demand for a constitutional
amen dnicnt.
Tho Avoiding of the Mexican plank
and that referring to Democratic for-
eign policies also afforded some stum-
I.Hnir Viliwkn iii the sessions of the res-
...... n .... ... . .
olutions committee. It is possible
that these points may be openly aired
when a break tomcH on . tho st.ffrago
question.
Nominations Are Made.
President Wilson and Vice Presi
dent Marshall were renominated by
acclamation Thursday night liy the
Democratic national conveution, the
ticket being completed four minutes
before. Friday.
There never was any doubt of Presi
dent Wilson's nomination Thursday
night, but there was a possibility that
some vice presidential booms might be
brought out in opposition to Vice Pres
ident Marshall. They melted away,
however, when the convention got in
session and as .soon as President Wil
son's nomination had been made by
a roaring chorus of acclamation, Sen
ator Kern, who renominated Mr. Mar
shall, cast ashle a long prepared
speech and simply declared, "I nomi
nate Thomas Riley Marshall of Indi
ana for vjc.e president."
' As Judge YVestcott closed wKK a
mention of the name of "Woodrow
Wilson" the .crowd broke into a great
demonstration, which lasted 4."i min
utes. Moving picture flashlights blazed
ami flags were paraded in front of the
stand. The band played "The Star
Spangled Banner" while a huge ban

The delegates began a parade bear
ing state stanchions. The crowds on
the floor and balconies rose to their
feet. Many delegates stood on their
chairs.
"Dixie" and other melodies by the
band evokd! fresh outbursts of cheer-

EUROPEAN GEOGRAPHY
TO BE RECONSTRUCTED
Belgian, Serbian, Tyronese and German
and Russian Boundaries to Change
While Turks May Be Expelled
from Europe
By United Press.
London, June 8.--(By mall.) RoV
mapping Europe after war Is going to
be as colossal a diplomatic tusk as the
war has been a military undertaking.
F.uropean statesmen believe it will
take several yeurs. Some say things
will begin to adjust themselves grad
nally while the fighting still progress
es und that the struggle wftl eubsido
by degrees as these readjustments aro
affected In spots.
To show how complicated the situa
tion will be, the following is a sum
mary, from good diplomatic authori
ties, of the changes the allies unques
tionably will demand If they win de
cisively ovtjr the central powers:
Belgium restored and possibly giv
en possession of Holland as far as tht
river Waal; Holland, In this case, be
ing compensated by a gift of Gorman
territory to and Including Oldenburg.
The French frontier extended to tb
Rhine from the Swiss io the Belgian
or Dutch frontier. .
The Tyrol, Gorltz and Istrta, Includ
ing Flume, transferred from Austria
to Italy. ;
Vorarlborg possibly . transferred
rrom Austria to Switzerland.
Fast Prussia .transferred from Ger
many to Russia, and Russian, German
and Austrian Poland re-established as
a self-governing nation under Russian
domination.
Schleswlg-Holsteln returned by Ger
many to Denmark.
Hungary probably made a separate,
independent kJiigdom.
Hiikovinu turned over to Russia.
Roumania made a present p Tran
sylvania and possibly of a part or even
all of Bessarabia, as a free gift from
Russia. Another big slice of north
ern Bulgaria also transferred to Rou
mania. . ' .
Serbia and Montenegro united, with
all of conquered Serbia restored apd,
in addition, Bosnia, Herzegovina, Dul
matla and part of European Turkey
ceded to the pair.
Another fraction of Turkey handed
to Greece, except in the now unlikely
event that the Greeks should Join tb-
central powers.
Turkey, according to the geuerall?
accepted program, will be expelled
completely from Europe.
Some diplomats favor a partition o
the sultan's Asiatic possessions also
among the allies. Others are disposed
to leave him a remnant of this terri
tory, with his capital, presumably, St
Brussa.
There Is r,.i st ggestlon of any terri
torial allowance to Sweden or Nor
way, despite the fact that the forme."
Is exceedingly anxious for Finland.
Her pro-German smpi.thles undoubt
edly will prevent this but the assump
tion Is that the Finns will be given
the measure of self-government whic h
they have claimed all along.
Luxemburg presumably will be per
mitted to maintain a degree of aeuii
Inclc pendence under Frenc h protection
and domination.
Constantinople's fate Is bard to de
termine. Russia wants and seem
pretty likely to get it. This will giv
the czar his long-desired warm water
tort.
It is not iiiui h of a secret that Eng
land is not very happy over this pros
pect. The British would rather sea
Constantinople internationalized a
neutral city.
It will be haul, however, to deny ti
their allies the one thins they are
most particularly anxious to aocuif.
The issue may conceivably become tb
subject of discord between th td
big powers.
This, however, only disposes of Eu-
