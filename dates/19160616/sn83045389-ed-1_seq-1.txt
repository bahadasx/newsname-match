de. la Rosa to-day made pood his threat
I to raid the border, when 100 of his men
attacked a small detachment of in*
Fourteenth Cavalry at San Ignacio,
forty miles southeast of Laredo. His
action cost hJm emht men killed, sev
eral wounded and many horses and
some equipment. The American loss
was three killed and six wounded, as
follows:

Major Alonzo Gray to-day was using!
every mar: of hi? little command in a |
sweeping search of the country for a i
"hot trail." If it Is discovered, a third
punitive expedition may enter Mexico,
but at department headquarters Gen
eral Funston and his staff have little
hope that Major Gray will bo able to
get In touch with the band. There
was evidence to show that a large part
had re-entered Mexico, but other evi
dence Indicated that some of them at
least were scattered along the brush
covered country on the American side. ?
The rtrst shot fired by the attacking
party was at the corporal of the guard
at 2 A. M. A sentry had heard the
voices of Mexicans beyond his post. Ho :
could see no one and called the cor
poral. While the sentry and corporal,
were talking the raiding party at- :
tacked.
1IRISK R.VGAfiBMKXTS HAKES
FOR TIURTV MI.M'TRS
For thirty minutes, according to a I
report made by Major Gray, a brisk
enirapoment ensued. There were not !
more than eighty Americans in the:
camp, and it is believed the Mexicans
expected to find even a smaller nurn- ?
l?er. It was thr camp of Troop M, but
a part of that troop was on duty down '
the river. The remnant of that troo"J7
was re-enforced by Troop I, that came
fi oni ii station on the river above.
The Americans fought from trenches,
into which they were ordered immedi- .
atcly after the attack began. ^Vhen ^
they moved out and began the offensive. ?
the Mexicans were gone.
Major Gray reported that he had been j
in communication with a detachment1
of Carrnnza troops on the Mexican side j
of the river, and that its officer com- ?
manding had informed him that his j
men already had run down and shot !
four of the bandits.
Vincente T,lra, a Mexican, who entered
the American camp several hours after!
the fight, said he had been made a
iwisoner by the bandits at Ljarita.
twenty miles southwest of Laredo, sev- i
eral days apo. He said 'the party left
Ljarita Monday night and moved
steadily across the barren countrv i
without anything to eat. arriving near'
the American camp about midnight.!
The attack was made about two hours
later He said that in the confusion
of the fipht his guards overlooked him '
Lira's story was partly credited by the
American officers. Until a few months
ago he was living in San Antonio.
While here he represented himself as a
snake-catcher.
NAME OF I.K.W)Klt
OF IIA.Vn XOT REROUTED
The name of the leader of tho band
has not been reported. Papers taken
from the body of one of the Mexicans
indienved that he was Cruz Puis, a
major in C'arranza's army. Army of
ficcrs. however, believe it not itnproba
hie that Puis was carrying the papers!
as souvenirs of the days when he was
an officer In the government service. i
Governor Funston was not surprised >
at the raid. Several days ago lnforina- !
tlon reached here that De la Rosa ex- '
pected to make an attack at some;
point. Hecently it was officially an- !
nounced In Mexico that De la Rosa j
had been arrcBted in Monterey, but no
other confirmation was received here. !
Iti the meantime, he had concentrated i
some hundreds of his bandit army at j
LJirita in sight of the de facto gov- i
ernment troops, who moved north and j
south over the National Railroad. It'
was reported that General Ilicaut con- '
ferred with De la Hosa at Ljarita. !
The. Immediate dispersal of the attack - '
ing party to-day is a pursuance of the 1
same tactics adopted by the bandits]
who raided the border about Browns-1
ville last year. These raids were in
stigated by De la Rosa.
General Funston to-day ordered the
Thirtieth Cavalry to Eagle Pass.

1 AWAITED WITH IMTEREST
I'HKSIDEXT'S SELECTION
Mr. McCombs announced months ago
that he would not undertake the dlrec
? tion of the campaign this year, and the
party leaders have been awaiting with
keen Interest the President's selection

i Vance Criswell McCormick, who is
a native of Harrisburg, and forty-four
years old, owns the Harrisburg morn
ing newspaper, the Patriot, and has
been identified with Democratic, poll
tics since his youth. He was Mayor
front 1902 to 1905, and this year was
? the party's candidate for Governor.
Mr. Marsh is a wealthy manufacturer
of Waterloo, Ind. He has been known i
\ as a Clark Democrat, and his selection!
by President Wilson ns the man who
i helps the funds and handles the money
bag of the Democratic party, is looked I
I upon as an attempt to satisfy the!
Clark following.
Mr. Cutnmings has been the Demo-!
cratic national committeeman from j
Connecticut since. I'JOO. He is a law-j
yer. He was graduated from Yale in j
1891 and received an honorary degree !
in 1S9H, the year that McCormick was '
graduated from the same university. '
Representative Glass succeeds the i
late Thomas J. Pence, as secretary of |
the committee. He is the owner of two
daily newspapers at Lynchburg. He
has been elected to Congress for five j
consecutive terms.
