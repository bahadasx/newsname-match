BARRY C. WILSON DIES
SUDDENLY IN BOSTON
fas Formerly a Prominent
Young Man of Palatka.
a telecram received yesterday
Line bv Mr. F. H. Wilson of this
told of the death in Boston
$taday of Mr Harry C.
Wilson, oldest son of the late Henry S.
Wilson, one of the founders of the
Wilson Cypress Company here.
Thero was nothing in the telegram
-rot the bare announcement of
2 but Mr. F. H. Wilson states
that he has reason to believe that
death was due to heart failure, as on
Diwious occasions during the past
rear or two deceased has been ad
monished that all was not well with
tif heart.
Mr Wilson will be kindly remem
bered here, especially by all of our
older citizens, as 'a most promising
wrong man who for a time was en
raged with the Wilson Company and
also with the Selden Cypress Door
Co. He embraced Christian Science
while here, and when he left Palatka
some 15 years ago it was to take up
the work of promoting that cult. For
a number of years he was in charge
of the New York offices of the Chris
tian Scientists, and was really the
intellectual head of the organization.
To him was left the work of reply
ing to all criticisms of the church and
the work of defending its doctrines
and teachings. He was a man of
scholarly attainments and as a writer
on Christin Science topics he had no
superior.
Later ho was called to Boston where
he became the first reader in the
Mother church its pastor.
Mr. Wilson visited Palatka some
ihro years ago when he spent some
weeks with his relatives. lie was
about 4U years of age and married,
ifo wife survives him. News of his
death at the zenith of his intellectual
powers will be received with sadness
by his old friends in Palatka who
have watched his steady rise in the
profession t wnicn ne seems to nave

The closeness of the race between
Rev. Sidney J. Catts and Hon. W. V.
Knott for the governorship in last
week's primaries is bound to develop
a contest which can only be settled
by the courts and a recount of the bal
lots. That the trouble is due to the
complications of the Bryan primary
law (or rather the inability of can
vasing boards to understand it) in the
matter of the tabulation of returns, is
apparent.
Leading newspapers throughout the
State are conceeding that Mr. Catts
has a very small majority on the face
of the returns, and at Mr. Catts'
headquarters in Jacksonville the infor
mation has been given out that Catts
is in the lead by 409 votes.
At the Knott headquarters no fig
ures have been given but the claim
is made that Mr. Knott has a safe ma
jority over Catts on the face of the
returns on first and second choice
votes.
Men who are posted regarding the
primary law and the way it has been
interpreted by the various inspectors
and county canvassing boards, say
that there are complications which
can only be settled by the courts, and
that in many counties tho court will
be obliged to go behind the returns
to get tho facts.
An instance of how a county
canvassing board may err in a tabu
lation of returns is shown in the of
ficial report from Escambia county as
published Wednesday morning in the
Pensacola Journal. This report gives
the figures on Congressman used in
this illustration.
There were four candidates for
congress in the race Kehoe, Smith
wick, Stephens and Watson. The two
latter being the low men were elimi
nated. Kehoe received 1 ,(',70 first
choice vtoes and 872 seconds; Sniith
wick received 1,-liil firsts and 1)1)8 sec
onds, according to the returns. But
as Stephens and Watson, the elimi
nated candidates received but a total
of 5-!(l first choice votes, and as it is
the second choice votes from their
tickets only which must be added to
the Kehoe and Smithwick vote, it is
difficult for the average man to un
derstand how they could be accredited
each with more second choice votes
than the total first votes given to tho
eliminated candidates.
What has happened in Escambia
county has been duplicated in many
other counties of the State, and for
this reason it is certain that the
courts will be obliged to settle the
question as to who is the legal candi
date of the democratic party for Gov
ernor. There have been rumors of disap
Dearimr ballot boxes and oilier at
tempted frauds, but those rumors
should not be taken seriously. There
will be no fraud in the counting of
these ballots.
The day of stuffed ballots and ma
nipulated returns in Florida has pass
ed, never to return. If any man
should attempt to thwart the will of
the people of Florida as expressed at
the polls, the State's prison stares
that man in the face as certainly as
the sun shines.
If Mr. Catts has the majority vote
over Mr. Knott, then Mr. Catts should
and will be officially proclaimed the
democratic nominee for Governor of
Florida, and no man in the State will
submit more gracefully to that ex
pression of the people than William
V. Knott. What we say of Mr.
Knott, we believe can as truthfully be
said of Mr. Catts. All these gentle
men want, is to know what this ex
pressed will of the people is. Time
will tell for it takes time to recount
ballots and tabulate returns on near
ly 75,000 ballots.
In the meantime we can all in

ENDS WILL GROOM
For Supreme Bench Place
Vacated by Mr. Justice
Hughes.
Pensacola, June 15. Will Senator
Nathan P. Bryari be appointed to fill
the vacancy in the supreme court
caused by the resignation of Hughes
to accept the presidential nomination.
Many of his friends in Pensacola
are taking active steps to get the ap
pointment for him and it is expected
his name will receive careful consid
eration at the hands of President Wil
son. Senator Bryan's work in the Unit
ed States Senate has attracted much
attention in official circles at Wash
ington, where his reputation as a
clear thinker and logical speaker won
him marked recognition, and his
proved ability as a lawyer in Jackson
ville, before his election to the Sen
ate, are expected to weigh well in the
mind of President Wilson when he
considers the appointment.
In his private practice before the
courts of the country, Mr. Bryan was
recognized for his analytical ability.
His early training and his higher
education, it is contended, render
him eminently fit to hold the high po
sition. His diplomas from Emory
College and the law school of Wash
ington and Lee University, afford
him sufficient training to merit his
appointment.

Most of you know old man Edouard
Gravier, the court house janitor. Gra
vier is an American born citizen of
pure French blood. He is in his S2d
year and despite his years is as chip
per as a yearling colt. He is a re
markable man, is Edouard Gravier.
Ho is descended from one of the
old French families who came to this
country and settled in Detroit, Michi
gan, late in the 17th century, with
the great French explorer, Antoine de
la Motho Cadilac. For more than 300
years many of these families have re

The National Democratic Conven
tion at its first session Wednesday
heard the keynote of Americanism,
and peace, preparedness and prosperi
ty sounded by former Governor Glynn
of New York, as temporary chairman,
and with a high pitch of enthusiasm
emphatically registered by demon
stration after demonstration, its ap
proval of President Wilson's peaceful
conduct of foreign affairs.
Fully 12,000 people were in the big
Conseum. On their way to the con
vention hall the delegates passed be
tween lines of suffragetts spread
uiong trie street lor twelve blocks.
These ladies seated on chairs ranged
along the curbs were arrayed in white
and yellow and held yellow parasols.
It was given the name of "the gol
den lane."
William J. Bryan is present, but
only as a newspaper correspondent
with a seat in the press gallery.
John C. Cooper, Jr., is tho Florida
member of the committee on platform
and resolutions, as well as a mem
ber of the sub-committee which is to
present the platform.
Speaking of the administration's
policy, Chairman Glynn, in his open
ing speech said that it "has been just
as American as the American flag
itself." As he went down the list of
presidents, recounting their actions
to avoid war the delegates caught the
spirit of his argument, and as he
referred to each particular president,
some delegate would call: "What did
he do?"
"He settled the trouble by negotia
tion," Glynn would invariably renlv.
and the convention would roar its ap
proval.
It was plain that the telling points
to the delegates were Gov. Glynn's
recital of President Wilson's efforts
to keep the country at peace.
"This policy," he said, "may not
satisfy the fire-eater and swash
buckler. But it does satisfy tho
mothers of the land at whose hearth
and (ire side jingoistic war has plac
ed r,o empty chair. It does satisfy
the daughters of this land from
whom bluster and brag have sent no
loving brother to the dissolution of
the grave. It does satisfy tho fath
ers of this land and the sons of this
land who will fight for our flag and
die for our flag when reason primes
the rifle, when honor draws the
sword and when justice breathes a
blessing on the standard they up
hold." It is likely that the nomination of
President W ilson will take place this
afternoon, and that the nomination of
Vice President Marshall will follow
soon after.
A hot platform filled to the neck
with patriotic utterances will be
adopted, such a platform as will go
the republican convention of last
week a few bteter.
Change of Schedule.
Effective Monday, June 19, 191G,
the steamer Crescent of the Beach &

New Brick Building.
The stockholders 6f the Atlantic &
Gulf Insurance Co. were called togeth
er last Friday night to discuss plans
for the new business block to be built
by the company on the lot directly op
posite tho Putnam House and between
trie East Florida Savings & Trust Co.
and the Telephone building. The
company purchased this lot several
months ago.
Mr. G. Loper Bailey, president of
the company, states that they have
not agreed on plans yet, but have them
under way, and he expects to be able
to start on the new building within a
few weeks. A two-story building is
contemplated.
Boosts Interlachen Gravel.
Mr. E. E. Durkee, who is nothing
if not a good progressive citizen, has
tried out the Interlachen gravel which
is so popular a road material around
the little village from which it takes
its name and in the neighborhood of
Palatka, and is very much satisfied
and pleased with it. He used it for
building a sidewalk along the street
on which his home is located, and
while unformity in the matter of road
and sidewalk building is a desidera
tum within city limits, yet in places
where brick or cement would be con
sidered too expensive a luxury, trial
might well be made of the material
used by Mr. Durkee. Not only is it ef
fective, but it makes a good appear
ance. One carload of the gravel costs
from $30 to $35 delivered heie, and
was sufficient to lay a sidewalk about
2 1-2 inches deep, four feet wide and
about 200 yards long. It might be
that this would prove good material
for use on some of the lateral roads
which at present are such a great
drawback to travel in the neighbor
hood, and anyhow it might be well for
those who have these matters under
consideration to investigate a little
along this line. Hastings Herald.
