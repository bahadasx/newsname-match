$1.50 Per Year
AN OPPORTUNITY FOR FARMERS
The Chamber of Commerce is of
fering a special Incentive to the
farmers to get them to Join the or
ganization and become Interested in
the work. It has placed the member
ship fee at $1.00 per year for far-
mer members and anyone taking ad
vantage of this opportunity will cer
tainly get his money's worth.
The Chamber of Commerce is
making arrangements to manage the
harvest hand proposition and In or
der to do this will need the co-operation
of the farmers. It Is the plan to
have enough men here to handle the
crop nicely and to get them and the
farmers in touch with each other. It
has also taken steps to obtain better
roads and the committee on roads
has superintended the improvement
of the north road and is arranging
to build an east road soon.
There are a good many ways in
-which the farmer will And a mem
bership In this organization very
heneflclal as It Is always ready to co
operate with them In every way and
an supply them with UBeful inform
ation. The association sends out a
bulletin twice a month to keep all
members Informed as to the work
they are doing and to keep in touch
with the members in general. In
other communities the farmer mem
bers take a very active part and se
cure a good many considerations use
ful to them. They realize that their
development Is closely connected
-with that of the community and that
their co-operation is needed in this
development as well as that of the
residents themselves.
The secretary invites the farmers
to call at the office, which is the first
door south of the postofflce, and talk
the matter over and get an explana
tion of the workings ot the organiza
tion. They are also requested to
leave word as to how many hands
they are going to need and when they
are to need them.
OUR "ANGEL" GETS MARRIED
Enoa E. Manney, the young man
-who has served on the Democrat
v force for nearly a yearas print ar,
"angel," and in other capacities, got
J tired of the single life last week and
I got himself married. Miss Irene
' Rogers, daughter ot Mr. and Mrs. J.
C. Rogers, was the. fortunate young
lady. They were, married on Thurs
day evening of last week by Probate
Judge Campbell at his office in the
court house, Just an hour or two too
late to get the item in the paper last
week. We had suspected Manney of
contemplating such a move for some
time, but compared to the informa
tion he gave us the noise Judge
Hughes made In pre-convention days
-was deafening. However, we are glad
to see him get hooked up in double
harness and know that the young
folks wyi now settle down and pur
sue the prosaic paths ot peaceful
married life. The "old man" and
Haynes extend the glad hand of
felicitation on behalf of the old rag
o' freedom with which he Is connect
ed, and we trust they live long and
prosper abundantly.

TIE PILE A SUCCESS
A couple of weeks ago the Cham
ber ot Commerce established a tie
pile where those who came to Liberal
to harvest several weeks before the
crop was ready could earn their
meals and lodging by a few hours
work each day. The plan has worked
out very successfully so far. About
fifty husky workers have applied for
a job on the pile and have seemed
pleased with an opportunity of earn
ing a few meals and a bed rather
than to beg from the citizens. This
feature has gone a long ways toward
eliminating panhandling on the
streets and is providing a good many
men with a means of staying here
until harvest begins. The kindling
pile is steadily growing and If they
keep up the gait they struck on the
start there will be plenty of kindling
to supply everybody this winter.
SIGNED AGREEMENT LEGAL
The Merchants Journal contains
the information that Attorney Gen
erals of both Kansas and Oklahoma
have ruled that the grocers of any
community may enter Into a written
agreement not to extend credit to
anyone who owes another grocer,
without debtor having made satisfac
tory arrangements for settlement.
Attorney General Brewster says this
Is not contrary to any law and the
Topeka grocers have already taken
the matter up. This ruling Is not a
"boycott" and effects only the "dead
beats." It affords an excellent means
ot protection for the grocers and it
should be taken advantage of in
every city.

TAKE A BANNER TO OCHILTREE
The Chamber of Commerce is hav
ing some fine looking signs made to
advertise Liberal and the Sales week
at the Ochiltree auto races, and It is
their desire to get a line on all of
those who are intending to make the
trip. If you or any of your friends
are going, come to the Chamber of
Commerce office and let them supply
you with one of these banners for
your car.
SPECIAL GROCERS MEETING
The Grocers Auxiliary of the Re
tailers Association met last Monday
evening at the Eidson Produce House
and discussed several matter fa con
nection with their business. They
established a standard for handling
eggs on the basis of "firsts" and
"seconds" and all agreed to operate
on this basis. They decided to keep
their stores open later than usual for
the next few months in order to ac
commodate the farmers who would
have to do their shopping la the
evenings during harvest.
VSE THE PARCEL POST
By an agreement between the
Chamber of Commerce and the post
offlce officials those living on rural
routes will be able to Ret fresh meats
and fruits by parcel post on the same
day of the order If they get their
order In so that it may be taken to
the postofflce before eight in the
morning. This will be a great ad
vantage to the farmers as well as to
the merchants. During harvest the
feeding question is a big one and this
plan will facilitate It greatly. It will
also come In pretty handy in the
winter when the farmers do not come
to town very often.
TO HANDLE HARVEST HANDS
The Chamber ot Commerce has a
plan whereby it Is going' to facili
tate the handling of harvest hands
for the coming harvest. You are re
quested to oall and let them know
how many bands you are to need.

Is In the Liberal Light, Ice & Power
Co. office, the first door south of the
postofflce. Don't fall to attend to this
matter as it is to your interest.

from the Sheldon School of Chicago.

those who did not attend missed
something good.

home' of Rev. and Mrs. Thos. Hock
ett, when their daughter, Miss Bess,
and Merrill H. Morris were united la

bride, performing the ceremony that
made them man and wife. About
thirty guests, relatives and intimate
friends were present to witness the
ceremony. After congratulations and
good wishes from those present, the
party left In autos for Liberal, where
they took the train for Long Beach,

MADE A QUICK RUN
The fire department got a hurry
up call Monday afternoon, the fire
whistle blew, and the whole town
was thrown into an uproar ot excite
ment for a few minutes, everyone
wondering In the meantime where the
fire was. The fire engine with whis
tle blowing and gong sounding soon
got a right-of-way ot the streets, and
pandemonium seemed to have brok
en loose. The fire happened to be a
pile ot old boxes near the Craig
Bwlmmlng pool that had been hauled
there and set afire on purpose to see
how quickly the fire fighters could
get to that end of town. From the
time the whistle blew until the en
gine had run six blocks, unlimbered
and was throwing a stream on- the
fire, tour and a half minutes were
consumed. This Is pretty good ac
tion and ought to convince the peo
ple of Liberal that the new fire fight
ing equipment is a good Investment
and the volunteer firemen are "right
up to snuff", when it come . to an.,
swering a call.
