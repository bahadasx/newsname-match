ST. LOUIS, Mb.. June 16.—The
complete harmony program for the
democratic program was "busted"
vide open today. Harmony reached
Its climax near midnight when Presi
dent Wilson and Vice President Mar
shal were Renominated by acclama
tion. At 7 o'clock when the resolu
tions committee was putting the fin
ishing touches on its report after
twenty-two hours continuous session,
it was apparent that at least one light
of that long grind would he carried
to the floor of the convention.
This was in relation to woman's
suffrage. The committee fought out
the equal ballot pledge for hours. Jt
defeated. 20 to 22, a plan* for straight
out declaration in favor of a federal
constitutional amendment to give wo-
.w —V. -OTrp
"We recommend tie extension of
the franchise to the women of the
country by the states, upon the same
terms as to men.
This siiostltute was entirely unsat
isfactory to the suffrage workers. It
was regarded by them as a mere sub
terfuge—a "passing of the buck" to
the states on the matter., which was
just a lot of words, meaping nothing
in particular. The workers for a
straight out suffrage ^endorsement
were Indignant and openly voiced
their declaration of offering from the
floor a substitute which would com
mit the party to open and complete
accord in a constitutlohal amendment
granting extension of ballot.
It was a motley crew of politicians
and statesmen who wodnd up their
platform building: early this morning.
The room on the second floor of
the Planters hotel, in which they met,
was a sight to behold. Its floor wa3
littered with dead and stale cigar
stumps, with paper, matches, and
debris the air hung heavy in the
bright morning sunlight with the
smell of sweaty bodies and putrid ci
gar smoke. Members of the resolu
tions committee themselves were
frazzled—their eyes rimmed with red
from the long tense debate, their
faces lined with deep wrinkles of ex
liaustion and their voices hoarse with
excitement and straining in the con
stant argument and debate. Nobody's
ftemper actually broke down, but
there were some near casualties. Not
since seven o'clock last night had
either the senator from New Hanp
shire or Montana left the room In
which the committee met. The lan
guage of the Mexican blank and of
that referring to the democratic for
eign policy were also stumbling
blocks with the suffrage resolution.
There may be an open airing of these
differences from the floor of the con
vention when the break comes on
women's suffrage.

NIGHT SESSION OF THE GONVEMTIOII
Adoption of Platform Today Brings to an End
One of Most Harmonious Meetings
Ever Held... ..
Old timers in the democratic ranks
were actually pleased w*th the split
in the resolutions committee and the
threatened airing of difference* on
the convention floor. Thev held a
democratic convention wouldn't be
true to life if something didn't result
in a row or near row—and the 1916
convention has been entirely too
tame, in their opinion, to live up to
the best traditions of the party.
On Wednesday, if any democrat
had dared to predict there would bave
been any difference of opinion in tne
platform, he would probably have
been laughed down in deriBion. The
platform was the main thing on which
it was thought the party was In com
plete accord. Its skeleton foundation
had been prepared by President Wil
son and it was assumed all the reso
lutions committee would have to do
would be to Tarnish it off with choice
board to make it weather proof, bat
the carpenters had differant ideas as
to the sort of planking to he used and
the row was on. Democracy will have
at least a bit of a fight on its hands
when the convention meets at 11
o'clock.
The convention in the night's ses
sion which adjourned at 12:30 a. m.
today plainly showed it was weary
of further delay—anxious t» finish up
and go home. That feeling was even
more pronounced when the delegates
awoke with spre throats or aching
arms and legs from the over use they
gave such organs and parts on the
last night's outburst of cheering and
noise accorded President Wilson and
his running mate.
Democracy's convention history
with the climax four years ago at
Baltimore has recorded many stirring
night session?, but seldom any more
picturesque tftan last night's meeting.
A tremendous crowd took every inch
of space in the great auditorium—and
remained there until both Wilson and
Marshall had been renominated. Out
side all the city police reserves had
to be called to quell a general riot
of disappointed spectators. There was
considerable criticism of the police
today for their utter refusal to recog
nize credentials of committee men,
delegates or newspapermen in the
throng outside. Many with full cre
dentials were even roughly handled.
Doorkeepers with large circles of ac
quaintances had smuggled in their
friends without tickets and they over
flowed everywhere—on press stands,
Ringing to the railings, sitting in the
aisles and perched on window ledges.

ST. LOUIS, Mo., June 16.—The
democratic party, in national conven
tion assembled, adopts the following
declaration to the end that the peo
ple of the United States may both
realize the achievements wrought by
four years of democratic administra
tion and be apprised of the policies to
which the party is committed for the
further conduct of national affairs.
*.
Record of Achievement.
We endorse the administration of
Woodrow Wilson. It speaks for it
self. It Is the best exposition of
sound democratic policy at home and
abroad.
We challenge comparison of our
record, our keeping of pledges and
our conservative constitution with
any party at any time.
We found our country hampered
by special interests, a vicious tariff,
obsolete hanking laws, an Inelastic
currency. Our foreign affairs were
dominated by commercial interests
for their selfish ends. The republi-,
can party, despite repeated pledges,
was impotent to correct abuses, which
it had fostered. Under our admlnis-'j
tratlon, under a leadership which has
never faltered, these abuses have
been corrected and our people havo
been freed therefrom.
Our archaic banking and currency
system, prolific of panic and disaster
under the republican administration
—long the refuge of the money trusts
—has been supplanted by the reserve
act, a true democratic credit under
government control, already proved a
financial bulwark in a world crisis,
mobilizing our resources, placing
abundant credit at the disposal of
legitimate Industry and making ai
currency, panic impossible.
We have created a federal trade
commission to accommodate the per-|
plexing questions arising under the
anti-trust laws,
BO
that monopoly may
be strangled at Its birth and legiti
mate industry encouraged. Fair com
petition in business Is now assured.
We have affected an adjustment
of the tariff, adequate for revenue
under peace conditions and fair to
the consumer and to the producer. We
have adjusted the burdens of taxa
tion so that swollen incomes bear
their equitable share. Our revenues
have been sufficient In times of world
strees and will largely exceed the ex­

penses of the current fiscal year.
We have lifted human labor from
the category of commodities and have
secured to the working man the
right of voluntary association for his
protection and welfare. We have
protected the rights of the laborer
against the unwarranted issuance of
writs of injunction and have guaran
teed to him ttfe right of trial Dy Jury
in cases of alleged contempt commit
ted outside of the presence of the
court.
We have advanced the parcels post
to genuine efficiency, enlarged the
postal savings system, added ten
thousand rural delivery routes and
extensions, thus reaching two and one
half millions additional people, im
proved the postal service in every
branch and for the first time In our
history, placed the postofflce system
on a self-supporting basis with actual
surplus in 1913, 1914 and 1916.
Economic Freedom.
The reforms which were most obvi
ously needed to clear away special
privilege, prevent unfair discrimina
tion, and release the energies of men
of all ranks and advantages, have
been effected by recent legislation.
We must now remove, so far as pos
sible, every remaining element of un
rest and uncertainty from the path
of the business men of America and
secure for them a continued period of
quiet, assured and confident pros
perity.

Tariff.
We reaffirm our belief In the doc
trine of a tariff for the _• tople, pro
viding sufficient revenuo for the oper
ation of the government economically,
unreservedly eftdorse the Tlnderwood
tariff law as truly exemplifying that
doctrine. We recognize tariff rates
are necessarily subject to change to
meet changes in world's production
tmr» trade. Events of the last two
years have brought about many
momentous changes.
In some Instances changes are yet
conjectural and wait to be disclosed
particularly in respect to our foreign
trade. Two years of war which has
directly Involved most of the chief
industrial nations of the world am:
which has indirectly affected the life
of all nations are bringing about eco
nomical changes more varied and far
reaching than the world has ever be
fore experienced.

In order to ascertain just what
it WJ gi~i
STC* S3R-
these changes may be, tho democratic
congress is providing for a non-parti
san tariff commission to make impar
tial and thorough study of every eco
nomic fact that may throw light
either upon our past or upon our
future fiscal policy, wilfc regard to the
imposition of taxes on imports, or
with regard to the changed and chang
ing conditions under which our trado
is carried on. We cordi illy endorse
this timely proposal and declare our
selves in sympathy with the principle
and purpose of shaping legislation
within that field in accordance with
clearly established facts rather than
in accordance with demands of selfish
I interests or upon information provided
largely If not exclusively by them.
Americanism.
The part that the United States will
play in the new day of international
relationships which is now upon us,
will depend upon our preparation and
our character. The democratic par
ty, therefore, recognizes the assertion
and triumph sentiment of the Invisi
bility and coherent strength of tne
nation as the supreme Issue of this
day In which the whole world faces
the crisis of many fold change. It
summons all men of whatever origin
or creed who would count themselves
Americans, to join in making clear to
all the world the unity and conse
quent power of America. This is an
Issue of patriotism. To taint it with
partisanship would be to defile It. In
this day of test, America must show
itself, not a nation of partisans, but a
nation of patriots. There is gathered
here in America the best of the blood,
the industry and the genius of the
whole world, the elements of a great
race and a magnificent society to be
melted into a mighty and splendid na
tion. Whoever, actuated by the pur
pose to promote the Interest of a
foreign power In disregard of our own
country's welfare or to injure this
government in its foreign relations or
cripple or" destroy Its industries at
home, and whoever, by arousing preju­|to
dices of a racial, religious or other
nature, creates discord and strife
among our people so as to obstruct
the wholesome process of unification,
is faithless to the trust which the
privileges of citizenship repose in
him and disloyal to his country. We

He was forced to an admission that

The defense sought to infer that any
