RECEPTION
Princess Theatre is Scene of Gaiety
Saturday Night Gold Watch and
Silver Set Presented to Departing
Guests Mr. and Mrs. Fraser Leave
for New Home Thursday Morning.
The largest reception ever held in
Clifton in honor of a departing citi
zen was that of Saturday night at the
Princess Theatre when the autditori
tm was packed with hundreds of
friends who had assembled for the.
purpose of bidding farewell to Mr.
and Mrs. George W. Fraser, and al
so to present them with handsome
remembrances in recognition of their
friendship and good will toward the
departing guests .
Adams' orchestra opened the pro
gram with a selection after which
Mr. Fraser was escorted to the stage
amid generous applause. His appear
ance was followed shortly by Mrs.
Fraser who was- also heartily receiv
ed and they took: their places in the
center of the stage. Several of the
old time friends of Mr. and Mrs.
Fraser attended them on the stage
during the presentation ceremonies.
Dr. Li. A. W. Burtch, in behalf of
the committee in charge of affairs, in
his usual happy manner introduced
Hon. John Christy, who made the pre
sentation speech. In introducing the
principal speaker of the evening Dr.
Burtch prefaced his remarks by say
ing that he felt this honor should have
been delegated to one who was him
self an old timer and that although he
.had known several of the old timers
whose names he mentioned since they
wore knee pants, he felt that on this
occasion he couldjiot do the subject
Justice. However, the reception of
his remarks by the large
audience
provea otnerwise. j interests of their principles.
Mr. John Christy, in opening his re- j a feeling of good fellowship and a
marks, said: "No eloquence nor .desire to co-operate with the men in
words of speech are needed at this the coming election permeated the
time to attest, to the esteem in which meeting on Tuesday evening and it is
the guests of honor are held. This probable that other clubs will be

Mr. Christy's speech was full of hu-
mor and pathos and in closing he
stated that when the history of Clif

be devoted to Mr. Fraser as one of
its toremost citizens ana , tnat tnose ;

Mr. and Mrs. Fraser both feelingly
responded to the tribute and assured
their friends that they would ever
hold their friendship at its true worth
and that in their far away home they
would often think of these friends
with love and appreciation. After
short reception dancing was enjoyed
by those present, the music being fur
nished by Adams Orchestra.
" Mr. Fraser was one of the oldest
men in point of service with the
Arizona. Copper company, having
come to Clifton from Motherwell,
Scotland, June 18, 1884, and taking a
position with the company and being
In their "service continuously for 32
years. Prior to coming to Clifton he
spent a few months in Wyoming. In
the early days life was not all rosy.
He tells of various conflicts with the
Indians and of how the section men on
the A. & N. M. railway were at
times attacked by them and were com
pelled to work with rifles ready at
hand.
Mr. Fraser built the first blower room
at the old smelter which was in charge
of Emil Schuman at that time. This
plant was run by a water turbine and
at times when the river was low
much difficulty was experienced dn
keeping the machinery in motion.
Later he had charge of the machinery
as repair man and held this position
for ten years, from 1884 to 1894. At
this time nothing but black copper
was made as there was no converter
plant and much of the copper values
were not saved, however, in recent ; complete .
years the o!d slag dumps have been , '
excavated and these rich values have .
been redeemed. The converter plant, month. He was always ready with a
was built In 1901 and was in charge helping hand and words of advice in
of Phil Heir as foreman. Mr. Fraser ! anything that pertained to the better
was in charge of the converter plant ment of civic conditions and he is

this time the smelter had no superin-
tendent but was under the supervis
ion of the general manager who acted
also as superintendent of the smelting
department. In 1907 Mr. Fraser as
sumed the position of superintendent
which office he held until the old
smelter was closed in December, 1913.
Upon the building of the new smelter
he became general foreman of repairs
and had charge of the excavation
work at the old plant. This position
. he held until the first of the present
year when at the conclusion of the
long strike he was placed In charge
of the employment bureau of the Ari
zona Copper Company, Ltd.
In the civic life of the community
Mr. Fraser always took an active
part and upon the incorporation of
the Town- of Clifton he waa elected Its
first mayor which office he held con
tinuously for seven years, retiring

M. Clark, of

Causes Death of W.
Duncan Others In-
Duncan, June 15. The people of
Duncan were shocked on Sunday
morning to learn that William M.
Clark, a local merchant, met instant
death in an automobile accidentwhich
occurred that morning at about 4 o'
clock . The accident happened on the
Duncan-Lordsburg road at a point
between the Burton place and the rail
road crossing, a short distance south
of town. - Mr. Clark was a member
of an auto party which had been to
Lordsburg Saturday night and were
on their return trip.
The car is said to have been travel
ing at a speed of about 30 or 35 miles
an hour- when for some unknown
reason it left the road and overturn
ed, pinning the unfortunate man be
neath. When the ca was raised it
was found that Mr. Clark waa dead,
and, judging from his injuries, death
must have been instantaneous, as the
frame of the windshield had passed
entirely through his body.
The members of the party included
William Brooks, owner of the car, who
was driving it at the time of the acci
dent Sherman Stewart and James
Carter, all of Duncan. When the car
lert tne road it struck a corrugated
jiron culvert and turned completely In
! the air and landed some distance
away bottom side up. Carter was
thrown out over the back of the ma
chine, while the other members of
the party were caugat beneath the
car. Carter went to the assistance
of his friends and succeeded in ex
tricating the back of the car and was
endeavoring to release himself. His
injuries were found to be bruises and
he and Carter endeavored to extricate
the other two men. However, it
was impossible, and tne car was turn-
ed over. The body of Mr. Clark was
lying across Brooks, and the latter
was partially stunned and considera
bly bruised . The body of the un
fortunate man was taken to the Ma
sonic hall, where it was prepared for
burial .
William Mountcastle Clarke was
born at Howell, Lincoln county ,Tenn.,
on January 14, 1873, where he made
his home until 24 years ago, when the
family came west and settled in Tx
as. Later he came to El Paso, then
to Morenci and Clifton, being employ
ed In the latter place by the-A. C.
store as head of the grocery depart
ment.
He came to Duncan about eight
years ago, when he established the
business he was conducting at the
time of his death. He was married at
Farettville, Tenn., on June 21, 1904
to Miss Ellis McDaniel. Seven
Children being borne to them, three
of whom having preceded him to the
grave. The cnildren surviving are
Laura, William, McDaniel, Willa and
Rachael. His mother and a sister,
Miss Bessie Clark also survive him.
His family was visiting at Fayette
ville, Tenn., at the time of his death
and were notified by wire, arriving
here on Wednesday night.
Interment occurred on Thursday
morning, services being held at the
family home at 10 o'clock, being con
ducted by Rev . Wheeler, 'after which
the local Masonic lodge took charge
of the services and held their impres
sive ceremonies at the grave. A large
number of friends of the family ac
companied the' remains to their last
resting place.
Mr. Clark was well liked by all
and during his residence in Duncan
had won the friendship of everybody.
He was prominent in Masonic circles,
being worshipful master of the local
lodge at the time of his death. His
death removes from this community a
man who was one of the leaders in
local business circles and an honest
and upright citizen. The bereaved
family has the sympathy of the entire
community.

eral years and is well known in that
community where he will prove a for

DUNCAN MERCHANT
CLIFTON BOYS DRAW
FIRST BLOOD
SUNDAY
With a Score of 17 to 4 Clifton Trim
the Hill City Boys in the First Game
to be Played Between Morenci and
Clifton.
Sunday afternoon proved to be a dls
astrous beginning for Morenci in the
base ball field when the local boys
trimmed them in the initial game
with a score of 17 to 4 and trium
phantly marched home with the scalp
of the Hill Billies who had the temer
ity to challenge them to the conflict.
Although one-sided the game was
thoroughly enjoyed by a large crowd
of fans, the Morenci supporters doing
heroic work rooting for their home
team and endeavoring to pull them
through to victory. But a cruel fate
decreed otherwise and the hard work
of the Morenci players went by the
board .
The features of the game were two
home run hits, one by Fowler of Mo
renci, and one by Riley, of Clifton.
Clifton had five hits to her credit
while Morenci had nine, with errors
standing one for Clifton and four for
Morenci. A little more team work on
the part of both nines will add much
to their efficiency as challengers for
outside honors, although the Morenci
Infield showed up well and all they
need is a good battery to make any
team In the southwest sit up and take
notice.
Eaton of Clifton looks mighty good
to the fans and it is up to them to
hold onto him. Jennings at third is
a good hitter and a good all-round
player. ' Lordsburg let a good one get
away. On account of the enthusiasm
over the home runt hit of Riley the
fans are now asking, "Riley, did your
mother raise you to be a ball player?"
Pete Azarte on short is a fast kid,
while Charley Chaplin at first well,
we don't need Merkle at present!
The Grimes brothers and Bennie in
the outfield are fast enough for any
copper league team in the southwest.
It fell to McKenzie and A. Grimes to
pull a pretty squeeze play in the sec
ond and ge( away with it.
The Sarah Bernhart of baseball,
Pete Riley, made his farewell appear
ance at Morenci by making a , home
run on a bunt to the pitcher. It is
understood that he will, however, be
kept on the advisory board.
Clifton will have a new catcher this
week and probably by the end of the
month two new inflelders will be
added to the team. The baseball
boys are doing their part in putting
up good ball and it is now up to the
fans to get out and root and boost for
the team and Clifton will have one of
the best teams in the state. All that
is needed is a little encouragement.
Clifton and Morenci will again cross
bats on the Clifton diamond next
Sunday at which time it is hoped that
a good crowd will be present as the
game promises to be closer and more
interesting than the one of last Sun
day. Turn out and help the boys do
their best.
Among the fans who attended the
game at Morenci were Dr. E. R. Mc
Pheetere, C. E. Tyler, Laurie Simth, !
Heine White.

EMPLOYEES MUST
ABIDE BY THEIR
AGREEMENT
This is Decision of Grievance Com
mittee of District In Dealing With
Strike This Week Called Without
Authority.
The Arizona Copper Company, Ltd.,
was again the victim this week of 111
advised action on the part of a group
of employees at the Coronado mine,
Humboldt mine and No. 6 Concentra
tor, in violation of the signed agree
ment between the mine managers and
their employees in this district, when
a strike was called without authority.
This is the third time that the com
panies in the district have suffered
loss and inconvenience by such, hasty
action on the part of some of th
men taken without authority and
against the express orders of the ex
ecutive committee, as a result the agi
tators and leaders in this last strike '
rave Deen aiscnarged ana tne action
taken by the mine officials has the
approval and endorsement of the em
ployees' grievance committee.
The trouble started at the Coronado
mine on Saturday last when the
morning shift showed up for work.
It appears that on the previous after
noon a Mexican mucker, working In
one of the s to pes of the Coronado
mine threw his tools down before the
regular quitting time, and upn be
ing asked by the shift boss why he
did so he stated that he had done
enough work for that shift. The other
muckers in the 8 tope followed his ex
ample. The shift boss took no ac
tion at the time, but reported the oc
currence to Mr. Scott, the Superin
tendent, who sent a message to the
mucker that he wished to speak to
him before he went to work the next
morning. On the following morning
the Mexican was given his candles as
usual but was told not to go Into
the mine until he had seen Superin-'
tendent Scott. The Mexican then be
gan circulating among the men with
the result that none would go Into the
mine unless the Mexican could go with .
tnem. as a result or tine action or tne
men Superintendent Scott closed
down the mine for that shift, with the .
exception of the mechanics who con- .
tinned their workV-
The night shift went ' on Saturday
night, and Sunday the mine was clos
ed as usual. On Monday work was
again resumed but at quitting time in
tne afternoon tnree roustaDouts De
longing to the construction gang, two
Mexicans and one Spaniard, were
given their time on account of the
fact that the job upon which they
1-ad been employed for several months
was completed. One of the men laid
off asked the boss if he could get him
a job underground, and the construc
tion boss explained that he had noth
ing to do with underground . work,
to which the man replied: 'If I . do
not go to work in the morning none
will work."
On Tuesday morning of this week
when the morning shift reported for
duty the three men who had been on
construction work, demanded they be
put to work too. As there was no
job open for them the demand could
not be met. The three men vthen
demanded that three underground
men who had been previously em
ployed be discharged and . they be
given ther places. This demand was
also refused and the morning shift
declared a strike on the spot.
General Manager Carmichael held
an investigation with the grievance
committee having control over the
Coronado and it was decided to close
the mine until such time as the men
could be induced to abide by their
agreement and submit their grievance
to their own grievance committee for
investigation before striking with the
object of enforcing their demands.
Further investigation developed the
fact that two of the men were respon
sible for the action of the men in
going out on strike and they were
discharged and the mine opened
again on Friday morning of this week
under these conditions, the men re
turning to work.
Meanwhile on Wednesday afternoon
a similar occurrence happened at the
Humboldt mine at Morenci on account
of a man being discharged for cause
on the night shift. When the succeed
ing shift showed up for work they
demanded the immediate re-instate-ment
of the man discharged before
they would enter the mine, and In the
face of the efforts of their grievance
committee, who did everything possi
ble to induce the men to abide by
their agreement, and submit their case
to them for adjustment, they sent a
message to the Superintendent.glving
him ten minutes to make up his mind
as to whether he would comply ' with
their demands. Upon their demand
being refused they struck. A mob of
two hundred and fifty then proceeded
to No. 6 concentrator and closed it
down. Later in the evening, largely
through t,he efforts of J. L.- Donnelly,
Yire-President of the Arizona Federa
tion of Labor, who made an appeal to
'the men to reconsider their hasty ac
tion, explaining to them that their
conduct was out of order and that
no support or sympathy could be ex
pected if they persisted in their course
and they finally agreed to return to
work, after a three hours' night ses
sion, and the mines and mill were
re-opened as usual the following morn-
