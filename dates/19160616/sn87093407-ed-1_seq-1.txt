DID YOU KNOW that Vice President Marshall walks like Charlie Chaplin? It's a fact! At least,
Art Youngsays so, and he ought to know, as he has been cartooning folks at Washington in nat>
ional magazines for a long, long time. Today on page 6 appears a series of sketches received in the
morning mail from Young at St. Louis, where he has been busy with his pad and pencil for The
Star. They appear in conjunction with a story from the St. Louis convention written by that master political analyst,
Charles Edward Russell. This writer 9 in a humorous mood, is irresistible. Read his comment. It*s one of the best
things, we think, in today's paper.

The complete harmony

cratic convention was
"busted" wide open today.
Harmony reached its cli
max near midnight, when
President Wilson and Vice
President Marshall were
renominated by acclama
tion.
At 7 a. m . when the res
olutions committee wan
putting the finishing
touches on its report after
22 hours' continuous ses

at least one of that
long grind would be car
ried to the floor of the
convention that on wom

SEATTLE, WASH., FRIDAY, JUNE 16, 1916.
The committee fought out the
equal ballot pledge for hours.
It defeated, 20 to 22, n plank for
a straight-out declaration In favor
of a federal amendment to glie
women the ballot.
It adopted, by a vote of 3T> to 20,
the following statement:
"We recommend tlio extension of
the franchise to the women of the
country by the states, upon the
same terms as men."
This aubstltute was entirely un
satisfactory to the suffrage work
era It whs regarded hv them as a
mere subterfuge a "passing of ttie
buck" to the states.
The workers for n straight-out
suffrage Indorsement openly voiced
their declaration l/y offering from
the floor u substitute which would
commit the party to complete sup
port of the Anthony amendment.
