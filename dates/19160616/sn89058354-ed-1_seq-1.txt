COLORED POPULACE IS
Coroner's Jury Decides That
Coon Hudson Was Dragged
To Death By Cow
NEIGHBORS FIND BODY IN .
FIELD NEAR NEGRO'S HOME
Many Wild Rumors Circulated
As To Cause Of the Unex
pected Death
For several days the colored
populace of the county has been
in a state of excitement as a
result of the finding of the dead
body of Coon Hudson, a negro,
in Cas league's field, near
Mansfield early this week. The
negro was a peculiar character,
it seems, and this caused more
rumors when his death became
known.
In the field where Hudson's
body was found, according to
the best information obtainable,
his cow was later found with a
rope about her horns, and it was
this that led the coroners's jury,
whicjijwas soon empanelled, to
come to the conclusion that the
negro was dragged to death by
the animal, as it was known that
she was vicious and dangerous.
Another theory is that the ex
citement and exertion occasioned
by his attempts to catch the ani
mal caused the negro's death, as
it is said he had suffered from
heart trouble.
Hudson lived alone on his
farm, which adjoined lhat of
Teague, and was last seen alive
on the night before he was
found dead the following da"yJ
Some negroes passed his home
and saw him eating supper short
ly after nightfall on that occa
sion.
The coroner's jury investigat
ed the case Monday and in the
meantime all kinds of wild ru
mors of murder, suicide, etc.,
were spread over the county. .

N. C. & St L. Double-Tracking
Ordinance Is Not Taken
Up At Session
PLANS FOR ESTABLISHMENT
NEW TELEPHONE EXCHANGE
Council Takes No Action In
Regard To Park or Indepen
dent Telephone Exchange
At a busy session Tuesday
night the city council ordered a
cover placed oyer the reservoir
from which Paris gets its water
supply; heard an address from
City Superintendent of Schools
M. M. Phillips in regard to the
conditions (if the colored race
in Paris and especially with
reference to the colored school;
discussed plans for the proposed
city hospital, which were pre
sented by Drs. G. T. Abernathy
and A. A. Oliver, and plans for
an Independent telephone ex
change for Paris, presented by
A. P. Diggs, R. M. Terry and
C. W. Howard.
All members of the council
with the exception of J. M.
Freeman were present at the
session, and although it was
expected that the ordinance
allowing the N. C. & St, L.
railway to double-track through
Paris would be taken up, the
matter was not even mentioned
at the meeting.
The main point of contention
in regard to the double-tracking
ordinance which has been
drawn for several weeks is the
proposed viaduct at Rison street.
The road has agreed to put in a
viaduct at Dunlap street but no
agreement" has been reached
with reference to Rison street as
yet.
The railroad has been anxious
to begin work and it is for this
reason that it had been expected
that the matter would be taken
up by the council Tuesday night.
Unless there is a special called
meeting of the council in the
meantime nothing can be done
for thirty days.
Action in regard to the estab
lishment of a local independent
telephone exchange was de
ferred, after Messrs, Diggs,
Terry and Howard had discussed
the matter before the council.
Action was also deferred in
regard to the proposed hospital.
The Chautauqua license was
released and the police depart
ment instructed to pay particu
lar attention to the protection of
the school buildings.
The placing of a cover overjthe
city reservoir will prevent waste
getting into the water and will
make it unnecessary to have the
tank cleaned and painted so
often as has been necessary in
the past
STREETS BEING OILED
At last the work of oiling the
streets has commenced. For
several days the oiling has been
going on along Blythe street and
Thursday the square was reached.
