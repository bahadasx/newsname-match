In his address as permanent chair
man, Senator James praised the pres
ent administration for its "matchless
record of promises kept and for free
ing the senate from the control of the
great Interests by making it elective
by the people at tho polls and for
driving Invisible government, the
lobby, out of Washington1" He de
clared the party was proud of Its
achievement In writing into law the
present Vnderwood Simmons tariff
bill. "Not a schedule in it fosters a
monopoly; not a rate In It protects a
trust," he said. "One of the greatest
features of the tariff law," he added,
"is the Income tax, which raises from
the fortunes of the rich, the prosper
ous, the well-to-do people of Ue na
tion, $120 000,000 per annum and lifts
this burden off the tables and backs
of the poor,"
Mr. James said he did not fear for
eign competition hero after tho war.

of the world, he asserted. "With
freight rates and cost of transporta
tion In our favor, we have nothing to
fear, declared the speaker.

credit of the nation. Panics no longer

pre-
paredness without militarism. During
this admlr'stratlon, he stated, more
has been done to build up an army
and navy in three years than the Re
publican party did in forty years of
Its existence. Self-defense and prepa
ration for it Is necessary, ho declared.
Discussing International problems,

istration's policy toward war torn Eu
rope, and said in referenco to the
Lueltania incid2t that our president,
"patient, patriotic, farslghted, the real
etatesman, handled this question with

department, the explosion occurring

Hcf rring to the Mexican situation,
Mr James said President Wilson has
handled it ably and that "his policy
has been the same as that o! Abraham

than half a century ago." He artted:
"When American soil wa invaded

protection of American lives along

In Verdun Sector.
London, Juno 15. On the whole
250 mile front, from the northern line
of Volhjnla to the Roumanian fron
tier, the armies of General Bruslloff
have made progress during the past
twent-four hours, despite the fact
that, according to Petrograd's admis
slon, the Austro-German resistance
has become extremely stubborn.
A furious battle is raging for the
possession of the bridgehead of Czer
nowitz, the Bukowina capital. The
Russian war office announced the cap
ture of the city of Sniatyn, twenty
miles to the northwest of Czernowitz.
Vienna admitted the appearance ol
Russian cavalry there.
The occupation of the city by In
fantry forces renders the defense of
Czernowitz extremely perilous, as the
Russians are now in a position to
sweep southward and cut off the de
fenders of the Bukowina capital,
should they Insist on holding out to
the last.
Six thousand men and twenty offi
cers were added to the number of
prisoners taken since the offensive b
gan. The total number now is re
ported to be 121,720, including 1,720
officers.
The first massed attack against
Field. Marshal Von Hlndenburg's lines
since the offensive in the south be
gan was delivered Wednesday north
of Baronovitchi. The attack was re
peated six or seven times, but, ac
cording to both the German and Aus
trian official reports, each broke
dawn under the Teuton fire with seri
ous losses to the attackers, who. In
the retreat, were placed under the
shell fire of their own artillery.
These attacks marked the Initiation,
It is believed, of a general Russian
offensiv e in the north, aimed at crush
ing in the Teuton front to remove the
danger of a general flanking move
ment against General Bruslloff's
army.
Further progress in the region of
the Thiaumont farm, on the east bank
of the Meuse river, in the Verdun re
gion, is announced in the official state
ment issued by the German war of
fice. The statement also announced
the loss of a part of the positions re
cently taken from the British south
east of Zillebeke. in the Yores sprtnr.

Developments at the Convention.
St- Louis, June 15. Opposition tcr
the renomlnatlon of Vice President
Thomas R. .Marshall has developed In
the New York delegation. On account
of It Chairman Kdvvin S. Harris de
cided to call a meeting of the delega
tion wfth a view to threshing out the
question of the unit rule. Some Tam
many men say they will vote for
Roger Sullivan of Illinois as President
"Wilson's running mute rather taan
Mr. Marshall.
The alleged fact that both Tam
many and Sullivan have been in tho
same boat as regards recognltioa
from the national administration
makes this development interesting,
although there seems to be no likeli
hood that the New York opposition ta
Marshall will assume really serious
proportions.
There Is no doubt now that Sullivan
Intends to allow his name to go be

think that his strength may be a mat

that they have broken Into the Texaa

interest. President Wilson's lieuten
ants can't believe, however, that
there Is any likelihood of the Sulli

An Influential element in the Dem

ble, to force the adoption of a declara

Charles E Hughes, the Republican,

Husting of "Wisconsin and Represen

of prominence In party affairs in
Washington It Is known that the
president is opposed to any direct
personal pttack of this character upoat
Mr. Huphes, He is likewise opposed
to an declaration criticising the Re

tice of the supreme court. Senator
Stone of Missouri, chairman of the
resolutions committee, is still insist
ent that the Democrats shall make
some reference to the Republicans ifl
"soiling the ermine" for political pur
poses. However Mr Stone, who ha J
a large German 'onsMtuency, Is vio

the platform that might alienate tho

Senator Hustlrs who has repeated
ly criticised the Germans of his own
state for alleged activity in further
