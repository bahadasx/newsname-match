vention. In this respect, it differed
Pi^ distinctly from the Republican conrv-entioa
and resembled tliat of the
Progressives. Temporary Chairman
i Martin H. Glynn, though his keynote
speech was less epigrammatlcal
than Senator Harding's correspond[
ing deliverance to the Republicans,
I found his. audience much more re-j
f sponsive and his oratory is being i
1 v complimented in extravagant terms j
by the delegates almost without exception.
The Harding speech was a
finished product of its kind, but it
lacked the snap and fire which <xlynn
into his neriods today. The Dem
^ I
ocratic delegates and alternates and
many of the guests of the convention j
were supplied this morning with good-!
, -l sized American flags, which they liietinctively
waved in unison at every
j* climax in the orator's appeals to the
"America first" sentiment, which is
the coming Wilson campaign motto, j
printed on the official "button designed
by National Committeeman 'McLean |
<rf (North Carolina. And, by the way, |
the convention unconsciously pinned
I on this morning by signing ^America" j
f first and then getting down to busiI
n-ess.
|
Smaller Than Average.
I This convention is smaller than the
average, "because of the practical
certainty that there will be no fight
over the presidential nomination and i
L no very serious contest over anything j
| else that is to come before the entire j
I body. In' some of the State delega- j
tions the attendance of alternates does j
I not amount to 10 per cent. The St.,
| -Louis Coliseum, however, is by no
means so large as the Chicago Coliseum
so that the difference in the
size of the respective multitudes is
not very noticeable. Both buildings
? were well filled on their opening sessions.
There were a few seats vacant
in the . galleries at Chicago and a
rew more vacant in the galleries here
H xou&y but the floor was crowded!
m in each case and so was most of the
space in the galleries and on the
I stands. The smaller dimensions ' of,
f * the St. Louis hall put an audience in
i closer touch with the speakers on the
official platform. Glynn was almost

New Yorker yielded to the clamor as
demands of the delegates and continued
his analogies to the obvious
satisfaction of the great assembly. In
I the demeanor to the delegates there
I was. nothing to suggest any lack of
confidence in the political outlook.
They acted like men who rejoice over
the prospect of victory, and by no
means like men who are attending a
funeral?which is the term which
some of the Republican leaders have
I used in referring to the St. Louis
gathering. A Republican onlooker
consoled himself today by remarking,
as he listened to the cheers which
greeted every point made by Glynn,
that he had seen the same high, spirits

nominated Judge T'arker in 1904.

; K. F. Murray in 'News and Courier.
St Louis, June 14.?How to keep
I the national contention goirbg for the
, four days promised to St. Louis Is
[ the only problem that is giving much
; trouble to the Democratic leaders,
| but this problem is worrying them
pretty seriously. I
Among the devices which have been
j adopted to prolong the performances
, is that of having the nomination of
I President Wilson seconded by each
State in a set speech.
Groans, not loud, but deep, have
I been heard in the hotel lobbies and
I wherever else the delegates gather
j since this- plan, contemplating nearly
j half a hundred seconding orations bei
came generally known.
"Can't make me listen to 'em/' was j

cation. There is absolutely nothing i
| legitimate to keep the convention in
session more than two days.
It is feared that many of the delegates
will break away and go home
j anyhow before the long program is
"I'm willing to pay the hotel for
four days, whether I stay or not," j
said a delegate this evening to a'
group of approving colleagues, "but I j
am not willing to waste my time here
i for four days when two would be sufI
ficient, or three at the outside. It is j
i a farce to use us in this way, merely;
' to give the city of St. Louis a run for
its money."

[THE NEWBERRY CITY PARK
OPENED ON TUESDAY
K
I)r. Cromer Makes (iood Speech?Says
Schools of City Lack Parks?
Should Have Two Parks.
Dr. Geo. B. Cromer made a fine talk,
I
! as he always does on occasions of this
i
kind, at the opening of the city park
on Tuesday evening. He spoke of the
j advantages of a park for the children,
the boys and girls, of a town
and city and the importance of getting
the land before it is too valuable
! to be used for such purposes. Of the
importance of "letting boys be boys
and girls be girls and not making little
men and women of them before
I
fziorlv ,f/\r that nprfnrmance.
L1AOJ C4.1 ^ m vuvij ivi r w. - ?? ,
He said >we should have two >parks, j
one on the South fork of Scott's creek )
for the -colored people and one on1
i
the north fork for the white children, j
There *eere several hundred women
and men and children at the opening
and if there was need of argument for '
the buildlog of a park it was in the
nresenre of these children and the
fun they were having, and not only'
the fun but the real "benefit they will
deriVe from it. Dr. Cromer said with
all the good schools we had there was
no.place at any one of the buildings
for a playground, a base ball ground
or athletic field, and these -were as
necessary as any other part of the
education t>f the child. He thought it
should- not *be an eleemosynary institution
which only meant that, you
would take up a collection to support
it. but it?hould be a business prop
osition and -with money to run it.
He said that one of the lecturers at
the chautauqua had told us that we
! should have a park all the way along
the creek from Glenn street on to the
railroad. And we think we saw a
| similar statement in our local cotem- J
: porav in speaking of the lecture of;
I Dr. Albert. We did not have . the j
pleasure of hearing Dr. Albert but it I
does seem strange that Dr^ Albert j
j should be given as authority for the i
i statement and for originating and !
i suggesting the idea when The Herald
and News (and a correspondent of
! ours) for at least ten years did not'
1 print a paper without saying some-1
j thing along the same line., and one
j time we had an option on practically
i all the property mentioned, and we
! urged the business men of the town
* - 1 V,.,.. !
1*0 taKe up me matter aim uuv i
j property while it may be obtained at
a reasonable price. At one time we
had enlisted the cooperation of one
of the pastors of the colored Baptist
church to let us have that lot also.
A +VI A A/vnorrAOfQtiA.I '
inai was jusi uciuic lj-ic v^uwun
, made cerain improvements to the
building. We tried to interest Mr.
Spearman and Mr. Wright and Mr.
Kinard 'but they would not. We are
delighted they are now taking hold
(even if they have forgot) and they
shall have our hearty cooperation and
support, but we just can't help making
ah effort to keep the record
straight. The Idler talked about a
* ? H- ttt r/ifa fn T" ' n

! paper and kept it up from the first
; letter to the last. And it may come
again. Let's "be willing to give the
devil its due.
'But the 'park is the thing, and "we
| are pleased to see the interest that is
' being taken. And Dr. Cromer is right,
J the park should not be on leased land,

I town, or a park association. And the
j sooner we buy it the better, and the ^
less it will cost.
The ^Newberry Concert band furnished
music for the opening, but
there is need of a pavilion and some j
other improvements and they should j
be made on land owned by a park as-1
j sociation or toy the town.
The park's the thing. If every one j
would just do a little it could be made
a real thing and improvements could
be made that would soon transform I
i the creek bottom into a thing of
beauty.

OF "DUTCH" 3FLEAX
/
Quiet Investigation for a Month Has
Failed to Locate Him?>o Motive
or Reason for His Disappearance.
Missing since IMay 14th, and with
his friends hoping day by day that the
mystery of his sudden disappearance
would be solved, Professor Fred
D. McLean, of the faculty of Newberry
college, has not yet been heard
from, and the mystery has become
more mysterious. A quiet investigation
t>_^p an-ri'c H i c o .n rwa nranpp has
U1 JT 1 L/JL# lUV^ii^au o **MWW ???
been made since he left 'Newberry
more than a month ago, with the hope
that his whereabouts would 'be made
known without the public prints 'being
resorted to. Up to this time,
however, all efforts to locate the missing
man have failed, and the story of
his disappearance lias been given to
the newspapers.
.\fr vrnJ^an left Jsewberry on Fri
day night, t.May 14th, on the Southern
train for Columbia. (He did not tell
any of his friehds of Ws .intention?
but left a list of accounts which he
owed in this city, with the request
that they be settled. He had a balance
in one of the local banks and
also left considerable earned salary
with the college, these amounts being
more than sufficient to settle all
of his indebtedness here. He did not
carry any extra clothing 'with. him,
but, on the other hand, lert nis room
and contents as if he expected to return.
It is understood that he told
several of his friends a few days hefore
be left that he was going to Columbia
in a few days but would return
on the following Monday. An Investigation,
which has -been conducted
in Columbia, failed to reveal anything
in reference to the missing
man.
w Mr. McLean aamfc to -Newberry at
A- * 4-V?yv CA^ciAn in "1 Q1 5
me opening ui uic m
from Youngstown, Ohio, accompanying
Coach Thomas, of Ohio. He graduated
from Newberry college in Juue,
191"., and was then electfed tutor in
the institution. While pursuing his
college course, McLean for several
years was secretary to Dr. J. Henry
Harms, president of the institution.
He was well-liked in Newbery, being
equally as popular in tfie city as upon
t] " college campus.
While a student at Newberry col
lege. McLean, who was familiarly
known as "Dutch," headed the list of
football and basketball stars in South
Carolina collegiate circles, and was
said. to be one of the best football
players in the South. While small of
stature, he was one of the fastest
men ever seen on a Carolina gridirou,
and had numerous offers from other
colleges in the State to join their
squad. He was at one-time assistant
coach of the Newberry team. While
in Newberry, he became affiliated
?+ Take's EDiscoDal church.
As stated, McLean came to Newberry
from Youngstown, Ohio. He
is a graduate of the Youngstown high
school and after his graduation he attended
Brown university, Providence,
R. I., for one year.
McLean is about five feet four
inches in height, and is apparently
about thirty years of age. Although
small, he has a very athletic build,
and weighs about 15-0 pounds. He is
a very nice looking young man,
dresses well and is ivery quiet and re
served in manner. His conversational
tone is very low, and he is a man of
few words.
At the time of his disappearance,
McLean was treasurer of the Athletic
association of Newberry college. All
of his accounts are in first-class condition.
The young man's family in Youngstc^wn,
Ohio, are making a diligent
I
J search, for him, not having heard
| anything from him since he mysterI
iously disappeared more than a
j month ago. Nothing is known of his
, whereabouts from this end of the line
! since he was seen on the train bound
I for Columbia on the night of May
! 14th.
! While the condition of the 70ung
man's room and his affairs in general
would indicate that he expected to rej
turn to Newberry a few days after he
j left for Columbia, the fact that he left
a list of his accounts to be paid would

| The following appeared in the Au!
gusta Chronicle of June 13:
There was another effort to identify
"Mr. Blank'' yesterday. "Mr. Blank,"
as is known, is the young man who
! is here and who does not know who /
I "
he is.
Several weeks a^o Prof. Fred McLean
disappeared from Newberry college
at 'Newberry, S. C. He was of
the faculty there, his ncme being in
Youngstown, phio. Up to ..his time
there, has been no publication of the
facts of his disappearance. He was
most' popular in Xewbery, in and out
of college circles. He was prominent
in college sports, was nfcknamed
"Dutch," on the campus, and at
one time was the college coach.
Nothing has been heard rrom aiin *.
by his people in Ohio. Leaving Newberry,
he left a bani; deposit of $90,
and an earned salary of $200. Most
diligent inquiry has failed to disclose
any reason that would have caused
his peculiar departure from Carolina.
His friends have made quiet inquries
without success, and are now appeal- \
ing to the public prints in the hope
of securing news of "him. He is about
25 years of age and quite a handsome
young man.
The other night Mr. B. A. Watts,
who travels Carolina for a Detroit
house, was a"1 guest at the home of
Prof. C. F. Wertz, of the Newberry
college faculty. -Learning of the case

his photograph, Mr. Watts inferred
that he and/IMr. Blank" might he tho
same man. Mr. Watts had kept .up ^
with the "Mr. Blank" case through
The Chronicle, and had a picture of
that young man. Armea wiui a portrait
of Professor McLean, Mr. Watts
came to August yesterday and conferred
with "Mr. Blank " He quickly became
convinced, however, that the
professor and the man in Augusta are
different people. As a matter of factj^
"Mr. Blank" was at the lUniversity
hospital long before Profecsor McLean
left Newberry.
t* mfltr hA nf interest to know that
"Mr. Blank" and Mr. W. E. Trowbridge
leave Thursday for Bangor,
Me. 'ttfr. Blank'' has made the statement
that, put in Bangor and given
an automobile he will be able to drive
to his home town in forty-eight hours'.
He is convinced that his hom^ is in
Ban gor, or in the vicinty of that
.city.
