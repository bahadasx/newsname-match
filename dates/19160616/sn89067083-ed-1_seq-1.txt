New Minor Coins.
Dimes, quarters and half dol
lars of new design will be minted
after July 1st, acoording to an
announcement of Secretary Mo-
Adoo under date of May 30., For
the first time sinoe 1891 a chance
will be effected in these pieoes.
Tbe announcement disclosed
that the half dollar has praoti
oally fallen into disuse.
The new design was selsoted
with hupe of restoring it into more
general circulation, it was indi
oated. Under the new .coinage
each piece will be of different de
sign.' The1 half dollar and dims
models wers mads by Adolph A.
Wienman and the quarter dollar
by Herman A. MaoNeil. Both
are soulptors of note.
The faoe of the nsw half dollar
bears a full-length figure of lib
erty with a background of the
Amerioan flag flying to th
breeze. The- goddess ia striding
forward to ths dawn ot a new day,
carrying laurel and oak branches,
symbolic of civil and military'
glory.
The reverse side shows an eagle
perehed high upon a mountain
Craig, wings unfolded, Growing
from a rift in the rock is a sapl
ing of mountain pine, symbolio
of America.
The design of the 25-oent pieoe
is intended to typify the awaken
ing of the oountry to its own pro
tection, Seoretary MoAdoo's an
nouncement stated.
Liberty, a full-length figure, is
shown stepping toward the coun
try's gateway, bearing upraised
shield, from whioh the cover
ing is being drawn. The right
hand bears an olive branch of
peaoe. Above the head is the
word "Liberty" and below the
feet "1916." The reverse bears
a figure of an eagle in full flight,
wings extended, and the inscrip
tions "United 8tates of Amerioa"
and "E Pluribus Unum." Both
the half dollar and the quarter
bear the phrase "In God We
Trust."
The design of the dime is sim
ple. Liberty with a winged cap
is shown on the foredde and on
the reverse is a design ot a bun
dle of rods and a battle ax, sym
bolical of unity "wherein lies the
nation's strength."
Clover Bloat.
Dr. D. F. Luckey, State Veter
inarian, has issued a statement
from the office of the Missouri
Board of Agrioulture in whioh he
ays the resent- losses of 'Cattle
from bloating, while on clover
pasture, have been quite exten
sive. The weather has been fav
orable for rank growth of all
kinds of elover. The white var
iety seems to be responsille for
the most of the trouble.
The danger is particularly
great on damp, cool days when
the clovers are fresh and palat
able. Cattle are very api to over
eat. The rumen (or paunoh) be
oomes over-loaded and ths fer
menting mass oauses a rapid
generation ct gas.
Tbe symptoms usually oome on
in a very short time. A cow may
be in a dangerous oondition with
in a half hour after eating heart
ily of the white or ether clovers.
Frequently, the bloating is so in
tense as to produoe death before
any treatment oan be given. The
rumen becomes so distended with
gas as to press forward on the
lungs and make it Impossible fur
the beast to inhale air, literally
smothering tt death.
The principal thing to do by
way of prevention ia to keep cat
tle off of rank clover pastures,
especially early in the morning,
after showers, or during damp,
oooi days. Such pastures must
be used with great care at any
time. It has been claimed that
feed.ng dry wheat straw, or oured
hay of any kind, will tend to pre
vent bloating when cattle are
turned on clover pastures. There
is no question but what this will
help some but it cannot be count
ed on as a sure preventive of
bloating. Some dry feed should
certainly be given when cattle
are pastured upon a rank growth
of olover. In addition to this, a
liberal quantity of freshly burn
ed charooal should be! kept be
fore ths oattle. Burn a lot of
oharooal every two or three days,
powder it and add a little ealt
and leave it where cattle may
liok it at will. There is practi
cally no danger ot over-feeding
on charcoal, and this will help a
lot in preventing bloat. Bear in
mind that in some oases bloating
wul occur even wuen cattle are
kept off ths clover until noon,
and there is uo absolute means
of prevention of bloat when cat
tie are permitted to graze on olo
ver. The curative treatment . de
pends upon the condition of ths
animal when found. In many
oases, the animal is already dead.
In other oases it is in a condition
to die in a few minutes, and
treatment must be administered .
promptly. In aoute cases, there
is no time tor giving medicines
by the mouth. The only success
ful treatment is to puncture the
rumen and let the gas out. Un
less this is done promptly, death
may result. The trochar is the
proper thing to use. The trochar
should be cleaned and disinfect
ed, as should the hair and skin
where it is to be inserted. Use
the necessary force and drive the
troohar into the rumen on the
left side and at a plaoe several
inohes forward and downward
from the point of the hip where
you find a drum-like condition.
In many oases, the troohar will
not be available and there will be
no time for oleanlngand disin
fection. If the animal's life is to
be saved, something must be
done right away. In suoh an
emergenoy do nothestitate to use
a pocket knife, or even a butcher
knife. Let the gas out or the
cow will die. If these orude in
struments are to be used, the
opening should be quite large.
Use the big blade of the poc
ket knife, and then out the hole
just a little larger so that the gas ,
may esoape freely, This opera
tion is not particularly danger
ous and should not be delayed
when the life of the cow ia in
danger.
Baloon shooting will be classed'
among sporting evente for the
next week at Garden City, where
a mercantile concern will release
