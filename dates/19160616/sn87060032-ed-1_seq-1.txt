Xhe Convention.
Chicago, III., June 12, 'lG.
Editor Mountain Advocate:
I desire to take this opportunity
to express my sincere thanks to
the Republicans of the district
for the honor conferred upon
n.j, in making me a delegate to
the Republican National Conven
tion. The convention is over,
and as you no doubt have already
learned that we nominated .Jus
tice Hughes for President and
former Vice-Pres. Fairbanks for
his running mate. I predict that
this ticket will unite the party
and insure victory. Justice
Hughes had no campaign head
quarters and no managers. He
' said nothing to hurt tho feelings
of any other candidate. Every
body was treated considerately
and fairly. There are no sore
places. He has the confidence'
and respect of the leaders and J
voters in both wings of the party. I
There is very little dilrerence in
the platforms adopted by tho
Republican and Progressive Con
vention. Hughes in hism accept
ance plants himself squarely on
the platform and comes out
strong for Americanism, tariff
and such preparedness as will
enable us to protect the rights of
American citizens on land and
sea, at home and abroad. His
telegram accepting the nomina
tion is an inspiration to every
American citizen. Col. Roose
velt was a candidate before the
Republican Convention. On the
first ballot he received G5 of the
985 votes, on the second ballot
81 votes and on the third ballot
18W votes to Hughes 949't votes.
Before the third ballot was taken
Col. Roosevelt sent a telegram to
the Republican Convention re
questing the delegates to nomi
nate Senator Lodge of Massachu
setts, but on a vote Lodge re
ceived only seven votes. After
the 2nd ballot the managers of
Root, Sherman, Fairbanks, Knox,
Dupont and Weeks got together
in an effort to defeat Hughes and
nominate one of their number,
but it was impossible to check
the Hughes sentiment. The
people and delegates were for
Hughes. A large majority of the
delegates was of the opinion
lhat Hughes could come nearer
uniting the two wings of the
party than any other man in
either wing. Eleven of us dele
gates from Kentucky voted for

Hughes on the first and second
ballots and on the third all 25
Kentucky delegates voted for
Hughes.
Col. Roosevelt in my opinion
wiil not accept the Progressive
nomination. In fact it is the im
pression here that he will be one
of Hughes' strongest and best
fighters in the campaign. The
Progressive delegates here in
large numbers are coming out
strong "or Hughes. Col. Roose
velt and other leaders of the
Progressive party deserve a
great dc-il of credit for burying
their own personal wibhes and
coining out for Hughes and to
service of the country. I think
there is no doubt but what the
party will be united in this fight.
Hughes is one of the ablest
and cleanest men in public life.
He is regarded bj those who
know him as one of tho very
ablest campaigners in the coun
try. We may look for the most
vigorous and brilliant campaign
that has ever been waged in thit
country. Hughes will not onl
unite under tho Republican ban
ner both wings of the party but
will attract tohim the Indepen
dent voters of the country in
? &&

'iiiye numbers and those groups
ot uters who are dissatisfied
with President Wilson's foreign
policy and the attitude of his
paitj on the tariff question.
This means in our judgment the
election of the Republican ticket.
In the event Col. Roosevelt had
been nominated by the Republi
can Convention, he and his
friends wanted Fairbanks as his
i aiming mate. Roosevelt and
Fail banks are- strong friends.
Th" delegates were almost unani
mous for Fairbanks for Vice
President. He received nearly
all the votes on the first ballot,
and on motion his nomination
was made unanimous. He will
be a tower of strength to the
ticket.
The Progressives nominated an
e-Demociat of New Orleans for
Vice-President, of course if he
runs he cannot get any votes to
amount to anything. Col. Roose
velt will not accept the nomina
tion. He and the leaders will be
behind Hughes.
Hughes represents many of
the Progressive ideals. Most of
the "'Bosses" preferred some
other man. The people called
for Hughes. This is the first
time since Washington that the
olike has sought the man. The
people will have their way. Let
e efy man who desires a change
in administration take courage
for we will surely win in No
vember. Respectfully,
J. M. Robsion.
Union College Successful.
The past year has been a suc
cessful one in every way, for
Union College.
Financially she is "on top."
E cry thing has been paid oil" in
lull and on tune, which speaks
bud in praise of the business
ability of President Franklin.
The enrollment has increased
considerably over that of last
year, and the students have gone
away highly pleased with the
method of management and the
quality of work done by each de
partment of the school.
Pom-teen graduates of the
Academic department received
their "sheep skins" this year.
The&e young men and women re
present some of the best families
of the country. It would be
hard to find a sturdier or more
industrious class of young Amer-

Sampson in Lead.
A careful survey of the twenty
seven counties of the Seventh
Appellate District of Kentucky
discloses that the majority of the
Republicans are favorably in
clined toward the candidacy of
Judge Sampson, and that he will
receive an overwhelming majori
ty at the polls on August oth.
Conservative men from different
parts of the district have spent
sometime in an earnest effort to
find out the exact facts, and have
submitted these facts to the edi
tor of the Advocate for the bene
fit of the public. There is not a
county in the district in which
Judge Sampson will not get a
fair vote. While in tho counties
ef the Cumberland River, he will
receive an unusually large vote;
and, especially is this true in the
Big Counties of Knox and Whit
ley. In Bell, Harlan, Laurel,
and Clay he v. 1 1 k. i . large
majorities. There are some
other counties in the district in
which he will receive majorities,
but they will be smaller than
those in these Cumberland Valley
Counties. All taken together,
conservative men acquainted
with politics are of one opinion,
and that is, Judge Sampson will
receive the nomination at the
hands of his party for Judge of
the Court of Appeals on the 5th
of August, next.
An Old Citizen Who
Knows Sampson Well
The Chautauqua.
We have been requested to sav
the public that the Chautau
ua, that is to be given here was
, tten up by the Ladies of the
Lnic League, and that they
have guaranteed the Company
the sum of $7o0.00 and that they
will have this to pay whether
they collect it or not. You are
requested to buy a ticket from
ome of the ladies that are on
i he committee there are 2o of
them and they are easily found.
Come on across and buy a ticket,
uon't be a quitter, they w ill ap
preciate it, it is interesting from
tart to finish, so get you a tick
et, enjoy the show, as well as to
nelp the ladies out of the finan
cial strain that they might get
into without your help.
To The Editor of Advocate:
I have known Flem D. Samp
sonjfor more than thirty years,
and have known his father and
transacted business with him
years ago even before he moved
from Laurel to Knox County.
I want to say to you and the
voters of this district that Flem
D. Sampson is alright, and he
comes from srood stock. The
Sampsons are all good Republi
cans too. I am for Judge Samp
son because we have tried him,
and I know he is a friend to the
poor class of people. He does
justice to all men exactly alike
in his court.
All the boys in this part who
stays with the log cabin are the
same way-all for Sampson.
