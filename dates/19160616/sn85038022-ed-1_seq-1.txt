WILSON AND MARSHALL
Itoiiomlnuted Uy Acclamation By t'he
Democrats Platform Is Xot
Heady, and Recess Till Today
Taken Fent u ro of Day's
Proceeding Speech
lty llrjan.
St. Louis, Mo., Juno 1C President
Wilson and Vice President Marshall
wero nominated by acclamation to
night by the Democratic National Con
vention, tho ticket being completed
four minutes bofore Friday.
Contrary to expectations, however,
the convention did not finish its work
because the platform was not ready,
und It will meet again at 11 o'clock
Friday morning. A feature or tlio day
was .a stirring Democratic speech by
William J. Bryan, of Nebraska, who
was received with great enthusiasm.
It was announced in tho convention
that tho sub-committee drafting the
platform had finished Its work, hut
that the entlro resolutions committee
was not assembled to pass upon It and
It wns not known when that could be
done.
President Wilson's own plank,
charging conspiracy among somo for-olgu-bom
citizens for tho benefit of
foreign powers and denouncing any
political party which benefits by not
repudiating such a situation, was In
corporated In the platform Just as the
President hlinsolf had sent it from
Washington. It was understood that
the President insisted that the plank
should be put in tho platform the way
ho had drawn It.
.Never Doubt of Wilson
There nover was any doubt of Presi
dent Wilson's nomination tonight, but
there was a possibility that some vice
presidential booms might bo brought
out In opposition to VIco President
Marshall. Thoy molted away, however
when tho convention got In session,
and as soon as President Wilson's
nomination had been mado -by a roar
ing chorus of acclamation.
