Easy to Connect Lanham
And Merrill With Nu
merous Robberies.
Lanham Has a Record
Once Stole Gun From
Tom Buckley.
Although Worthy Lanham, one of
the young men arrester in Clarksburg
on burglary charge, when speaking of
ilia Jimmy Valentino proclivities in
sinuates that he is a kleptomaniac, the
general opinion about the court house
js that Lanham is a professional thiof,
no having udmitted this morning that
he entered the room of William Bailey
at the Roush House and took from a
etand In the room a watch and chain
and J71 In cash. The warrant charg
ing Lanham and Morrill with robbery
states that the amount of money found
missing wa8 173. He told Thomas
Buckley, Jailor, that Benjamin Merrill
who is also in Jail, was not with him
when he robbed Bailey. He claims
that Merrill waited on the corner of
Washington and Madison streets.
What became of the money is not
known. Tho watch was taken "to
Clarksburg and sold. Two other watch
es which he admits stealing from a rail
road man were also sold in Clarks
burg. One of the razors which were
found on Lanham when ho was ar
rested bears the name of E. R. nav!s
and Company, of Clarksburg. E R.
Davis and company have a Hardware
store. The other razor is not mark
ed. ?
The opera glasses which Lanham at
first said he bought are old ones and
in such condition that even a second
hand store would not handle them.
They are of French ivory cylinders
with gold trimmings.
Besides the razors and opera glass
es Lanham wore a ladies' silver and
gold watch with a very fine ivory and
gold F. O. E. fob. The fob is of such
superior quality compared with the
watch that the officers have been led
to believe that watch and fob were
taken at different places.
The greatest puzzle which the au
thorities have to solve is where the
fence for the stolen goods is. Lanham
claims that ho buried his wares in
the Merrill back yard. Merrill "don't
know what become of the stuff." A
search in Merrill's yard revealed noth
ing.
This makes Lanhara's fourth time
in the Marion county Jail. On two oth
er occasions he served time for steal
ing bicycles. The fourth occasion he
went up for 60 days for stealing a 22
rifle from the Marion Hardware com
pany on Main street. During this term
he managed to get away from the road
gang and was recaptured and forced to
serve additional time.
One offense which Lanham admits
and for which he was not prosecuted
was the lifting of a revolver from a
drawer In the desk of Thomas Bucke
ly, jailor. Buckely refused to prose
cute on conditions that the gun is re
turned.

"Because they arc unable;to obtain,
whiskey and beer to feed their babies
I many miners are leaving
I glnia." Mrs. T. 1. Brett made this
statement at the meeting of th< .Antt
Tuberculosis league last night and
used i; as an illustratlon,:ofiue,"fliiit
that Marlon county as well-aa Fair
mont Is badly in need of the servicea
of an especially trained vlsltinfjnurtk
to educate and assist such parent* In
the care of their children. At tha re
sult of tlie meeting last night It la
likely that two or possibly three Red
Cross nurses will be secured Instead
of the one that the local son
lnally contemplated.
"A six months old baby tl
I grow up to be a degenerate^!

example of the present need oja aura*

service that was told by Dr. Chesney
M. Raraago, city physician. A number
of other instances where a nurse la
needed badly were mentioned by the
physicians and local worker* who all*
uressed the meeting.
Although the rain last night kept
many persons away from (lie meeting
it was well attended and all were in
tensely interested by the talk
by Miss Fanny F. Clement, 0( Wash
ington D. C? who is the bead ot the
National Red Cross society. Idlaa
Clement told of the various kinds of
work done by Red Cross no
over the United Statana&u
thaf could be accompllihbuj^^^^
mont by the work of one ot these
nurses. Ways and meana of financ
ing the expense of the nurse were dia
cuHsed und it was decided to ask the
asKlmance of the city and the various
local organizations that are Interacted
In the public welfare. Mayor Dowen
was present and In a short talk suf
gcBied that the proposition he submit
ted to the Hoard of Affairs at the next
meeting and a committee of the offi
cers of the ioi.il league was appointed
for this purpose. It Is likely that the
Chambor of Commerce of the Wom
ans Club and the local fraternal aaaoo
iatlons will be asked to assist In the
work. If the scope of the nurses la
extended to the conntqaa well as
Fairmont, the county court j? be ask
ed to provide a portion of the funds
needed.
As the work of the nurses win
to care for all of the cases needing
bedside nursing, before any education^

will work in co-operation with the
