Location of the Garden.
In selecting the location for a
ho vegetale garden the ques
tion of proximnit to the home
should be given first consideration.
As the work of caring for the
garden is usually done in spare
time, the location selected should
be as near the house as possible.
The slope and type of soil should
be the next consideration. A slope
to the south or southeast is usually
preferable, because here the soil
warms up early in the spring,
which permits early planting and
stimulates the early growth of
crops. Practically any type of
soil can be used for the garden,
but a sandy loam is to be preferred.
Good drainage is of prime im
portance. The land should have'
sufficient fail to drain off sv' plus
water during heavy rains, but the

factory. On level land that is not
artificially drained it is necessary
to plant on ridges or in beds to
prevent drowning the crops during
wet weather. The ridges or beds
should be as wide and flat as con
ditions will allow, for narrow,
sharp ridges dry out quickly.
