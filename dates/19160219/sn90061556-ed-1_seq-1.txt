REPUBLICAN PRIMARIES
GROW INTERESTING
EIGHTH WARD NEGROES SUPPORTING
REGULAR UNINSTRUCTED DELEGATION
"BILLY" HUESTON AND MARSHALL CARTER CONDUCTING
CAMPAIGN IN INTEREST OF CITY'S WELFARE
MANY PROMINENT WHITE MEN HELP
Tho most Interesting primary cam
paign which Kansas City has wit
nessed in a, great many years is now
In progress in the Republican party.
The Interest Is in a great measure due
to the peculiar conditions that exist
and the fact that the campaign is be
ing made without the inspiring Influ
ence of rival candidates for the nom
ination. In the prlmaryjof the Democratic
Tarty which has' just been settled this
-week a great Interest was developed
because It was generally recognized
that the contest was a life and death
struggle between the two factions
that have dominated the affairs of the
party locally during the last few years
and that the result would likely mean
the political end of either the one or
the other. In tho Republican primar
ies tbo situation Is different.
In spite of the 'fact that during the
last three months at least a score of
.good men have been suggested as pos
sible nominees on the Republican
ticket as possible candidates for may
or, and in spite of. the fact that most
any one of the men suggested would
be willing to accept the nomination
upon the Republican ticket, as the
political straws which are blowing
about indicate quite strongly that the
man who runs upon the Republican
ticket will be the next mayor of Kan
sas City, the field has remained com
paratively open and all patriotic Re
publicans are willing to leave the mak-
MRS. M. C. Mitchell.
A woman of rare business ability
who has made a success of the real es
tate business and who is probably the
largest property owner among the col
ored women of this city. She has Just
recently completed a handsome new
duplex.
lng o fthe decision up to the conven
tion which has been set for February
28, at Convention Hall.
, In practically all of the wards un
lns'tructed delegations will bo select
ed to attend the Republican city con
vention as there seems to be a clearly
defined notion in the minds of Repub
licans generally that this is the prop
er method to" be pursued If the har
mony of the party is to be .restored
and the election of the ticket accom
plished. Not only are the party lead
ers practically unanimous in this sen
timent, but there are also in accord
with It most of the men who are at all
times leaders in movements which are
not considered parly matters, but
whose interest in public affairs is
prompted -by their convictions as to
-what they believe to bo for the best
interest of the city. In the lists of un
Instructed delegates so far selected
are to be found iho names of such men
as ex-mayor Henry M. Beardsley, D,
J, Haff, E. C. Meservy, O. V, Dodge
and other men who have been proml
nent for tho part they have played, in
the promotion of the welfare of the
city.
In the wards of the city in which
the Negro voto is strong, the Fifth,
Eighth and Eleventh, there Is a gen
eral sentiment in favor of unlnstruct'
ed delegations as is evidenced by tho
action of the colored Republican, clubs
in these wards In passing resolutions
declaring themselves in favor of this
policy.
Especially in the Eighth ward Is the
situation Interesting. Irivthts ward the
majority of tha Republican vote Is
overwhelmingly colored and the cot
ored voters under the leadership of the
two colored committeemen from that
ward, V. C. Hueston and Marshall E.
Carter, expressed early In the contest
a desire that tho- ward delegation
should go to the city convention unln
structed. In spite of their expressed
preference the two white committee
men from tho ward, Edward Jewell
and Harry Koehler saw fit to attempt
to deliver the ward against the prefer
ence of a majority of the voters. As
THE
a result the Eighth ward will bo the
scene of one of the most spirited con
tests in the city on next Thursday,
February 24, tho day on which the
Republican primary will be held. Tho
lines have been thrown out for the
battle, Hueston and Carter have thor
oughly organized their forces and are
going to the primaries fully confident
of a victory for their unlnstrUcted del
egation. At the beginning of the contest a
number of the colored leaders of the
ward had lined up with the "Hale for
Mayor" movenftnt before tho senti
ment for an unlnstructed delegation
had developed, but as soon as Mr. Hale
announced his" withdrawal from the
contest they brought their strength to
tho fight which is being fnade by the
two colored committeemen with the
result that the strong men of the ward
are now a unlt-for the delegation.
Every precinct In the Eighth Is or
ganized and all the colored precincts
are In charge of a colored precinct cap
tain and a corps of lieutenants, and on
Tuesday evening of this week at a
meeting of the voters held in the audi
torium of Tho Kansas City Sun office
a campaign committee of seventy-five
was selected. This committee will
give two big mass meetings in the
ward before next Thursday, the first
at Lyric hall on Friday evening, Feb
ruary 18, and the other at one of the
churches in the north end of the ward
on Wednesday evening, February 23,
the place to be announced by hand
bills and post card.
The ward is bubbling over with in
terest and enthusiasm as this is the
first time the colored voter.s have had
an opportunity to show ihgir interest
in the success of the party and the
welfare of the city.
The following men are members of

AN AMERICAN NEGRO
CATHOLIC BISHOP
(By Walter F. McEntlre.)
The See of Panama Is the oldest
See on tho American continent. Tho
first church In the diocese was built
in a temporary colony on the Atlantic
sldo of the Isthmus Santa Maria de
la Antlqura del Darien early in the
sixteenth century. Tho seat of the
Bishopric, however, was soon changed
to old Panama and no trace of the ear
lier settlement was left. The only
thing remaining to mark the location
of old Panama is the ruins of the tow
er of the church', sometimes called St.
Augustine and sometimes St. Athan
aslus. The cathedral of tho diocese at
this time is located in the present
(new) City of Panama and was built
from the private purso of one of it3
bishops, and that man a Negro. This
bishop was Rt. Rev. Francisco avler
de Luna Victoria. One of the his
torians says that he was "the first
bishop of Negro blood In America and
probably of native birth to wear the
mitre." So far as our investigations
have led us, It appears that he was
the first bishop of American birth, and
we have yet to Arid a record of another
Negro bishop in America.
His Father a Charcoal Burner.
The father of Bishop Luna Victoria
was a freed Negro slave who pursued
life avocation of a charcoal burner,
making his charcoal near Boca de Ia
Reo Graned and peddling It on his
back in the streets of Panama, as one
there may see Negroes still doing.
This freed slave lived for no other
purpose than to rear and educate his
son and offer htm for the sacred min
istry, and he saw his purpose accom
plished. Luna Victorin was not only
a man of virtue and -learning, but a
successful man of affairs as well.
We read in the records that. the
Episcopal See of Panama became va
cant by the promotion of Bishop Juan
de Sastaneda to the See of Cuzco,
Peru, and it having been offered to and
refused by several members of relig
ious orders, "the mitre fell upon the
head of the priest Francisco Javier de
Luna Victoria, a Negro, native of the
country, who had ascended in the de
grees of the ecclesiastical hierarchy
by his merits and his virtues. The
news of his nomination caused such a
disappointment among the members
of the Chapter of the Cathedral, that
one of them saldt "Is Luna Victoria
tho Bishop of Panama? Then I must
go' cut wood in the mountains." Surely
this worthy man was not moved to
speak in this manner because Luna
Victoria was, a Negro, for there was
no antipathy to Negroe sthen in the
church in tho South American country,
as we shall later point out. Luna Vic
toria was well received and accepted
by the people of Panama In those days
when It was known as "a proud and
wealthy city."
Transferred to Peru.
Ho took possession of the diocese
on the 15th of August, 1751. "The new
prelate furnished at his own expense
the cathedral and enriched it with
jewels and precious vestments, placed
the bells on the towers, and was trans
ferred .to the See of Trujlllo, Peru, In
1759." Ho continued to furnish the
money until the building was com
pleted on the 3d of December, 1760,
"as may be read on the front of the
same."
The See of Trujlllo was established
by Gregory XIII in 1577. The city was
founded by Gonzalo Plzarro in 1535.
Near the city lie the ruins of the Gran
Chimu, known originally as Chan
Chan, being the title of the Indian
sovereign who fell before the Incas
"one of the most stupendous monu
nients extant of departed civilization
From these ruins over $10,000,000 in
gold were recovered by the Span'
lards."
When Bishop Luna Victoria took
charge of the diocese, Trujlllo was a
flourishing city of Importance, and the
church was! the possessor of a cath
edral and a number of other Institu
tions, including "a college founded
there earlier than 1621." .
And here we may note that Peru
hab given to the church saints, the
records of whose lives shine as the
stars: Stfl Toribio, St. Francis So
lano, St. Rose of Lima and Blessed
Martin de Porras, a colored man.
And thus we discover again, as we
have often done before, under a black
skin, a pure soul, a kind heart and a
brilliant mind, and we may be permit
ted to express that in our future his
torical rambles we may meet with this
good bishop again and know hlra bt
ter. 1
How Could It Be?
Some people in this country, read
ing this article, still wonuer uuw
these "proud and wealthy cities" could
and would accept a Negro bishop, but
this will be made clear from the fol
lowing statements drawn from his
tories of South American countries,
written by non-Catholic authors who
describe our church as "teaching a
religion (sic) made up of the errors
of Rome mixed with Negro and In
dian superstitions." .
In South American countries, race
'antagonisms or aloofness is non-exlst
ent. There the conqueror and tho con
quered, tho master and tho slave, tho
white, tho black, and the brown man
havfe always worshipped on a footing
of equality, and it Is no doubt largely
to this equalizing policy of tho church
that the absence of race antagonism Is
due. There ia just as much social in'
