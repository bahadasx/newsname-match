BY CARL V. ACKFK.MW.
Berlin, Feb. 19. Germany has said
her last word on the Lusitania matter
and will not prepare another note
dealing with that question, it was
strongly inilcated in official circles
today.
Officials are not commenting free
ly on the latest reports from Wash
ington that Secretary Lansing will not
recognize Germany's right to torpedo
armed merchantmen. But the official
attitude, as nearly as it can be said,
is this:
Germany does not believe tho
t'nited States would question her too
closely upon the manner in which the
new policy is to be enforced. Should
the foreign office, for instance, in
form Washington just how German
submarine commanders will interpret
the term "armed merchantmen" in
executing tnere orders, officials be
lieve Germany would be imparting na
val secrets Germany believes that
this is a purely military matter con
cerning only herself and hor allies.
Is Closed Affair.
Kxactly what attitude the foreign
office will take in view of the latest
reports from Washington is not defi
nitely known. It was only stated to
day that Ambassador Hernritorff al
ready has been fully instructed rela
tive to the Lubitania settlement.
These Instructions permit him to
make the changes suggested in his re
cent conference with Secretary Lan
sing. Officials consider that the Lusi
tania case itself was really closed at
this conference.
Arouses CwcrmanH.
Amsterdam, Feb. 19. Reports that
the t'nited States will not submit to
Germany's new policy of torpedoing
armed merchantmen has aroused in
dignation in Germany, according to
advices received here today.
The Cologne Gazette, which has
close relations with the German gov
ernment, declares Germany will not
curtail the rights of her submarines
on account of reckless neutrals who
inpist on traveling on belligerent ships.
The other newspapers express- the
greatest astonishment at the news
from Washington, but for the most
part await confirmation from Ambas
sador Bernstorff before expressing de
cided opinions.
Want I'nited States Guarantee.
Berlin newspapers comment favor
ably on reports that the lTnited States
would lar armed vessels from her
ports and would refuw to grant pass
ports to citizens sailing on such ships,
and declared that concurrence in this
program by the United States would
end the submarine controversies.
In their earlier editorial discussion,
the Berlin papers declared Germany
would not consent to withdraw her
orders to torpedo armed merchantmen
merely because England gave assur
ances to the United States that the
guns would be used only for defensive
purposes. They declared such assur
ances already had been given informal
ly by England but that British com
manders had broken faith by attacking
submarines. Several papers suggested
that Germany might accept this pro
posal if the T'nited States assumed re
sponsibility for any breach of faith by
England by declaring war on her
allies.

THE PARADOX OF WAR
(RY RKTtXARl) SHAW.)
London. Feb. 19. All the bellig
erents are bleeding to death and
assurances that "our enemies are
bleeding faster than we." do net
meet the case, because no sane per
son imagines thar the death of an
Englishman is a final gain to Ger
many or that the death of a Ger
man is a final gain to England.
If the whole population of Ger
many had been wiped out in 1913
by an earthquake all Europe in
cluding these islands would have
been poorer and the same Germans
who send Zeppelins to drop bombs
on London would have been dis
mayed if Ludgate Hill had become
an active volcano at the same time.
It is the paradox of war that self
preservation becomes suicide and
suicide becomes self preservation.

London, Feb. 1 9. "We must
not and will not tolerate the idea
of our Irish regiments being: re
inforced by any but Irish sol
diers," said John Redmond, the
Irish leader, in a manifesto to the
people of Ireland, in which he
appeals to the young men who are
still available to join reserve bat
talions and begin training that
they may be ready, if needed, to
fill every gap in the Irish army

KAW IS COMING UP
River Reaches Stage of
Feet This Morning.

Stream Full Of lee; Jams "Will
roiaA Trnnhln
The Kaw river rose rapidly early
today and reached a stage of 16.1 feet.
Late this afternoon it began to fall
slightly. The current is completely
filled with ice, and in case of a jam
there will be trouble. "No danger Is
imminent," said S. D. Flora, local
weather observer. "But if the ice
forms a 1am and obstructs the current
there will be trouble."
In the past two days the river has j
jumped nearly 7 feet. The rise since
Friday morning was 3.1 feet. Ice is
coming down from the Blue river,
where', Friday it was reported that the
Rocky Ford dam was in danger and j
several bridges were swept out by the
heavy floes. Other tributary streams
are contributing their share of ice,
and the Kaw presents a sight un
eqtialed since the high water of last
fall.
The river is being closely watched
for any indication of trouble by farm
ers along the stream and by people of
the towns below Topeka. A jam six
miles long was reported Friday be
tween Lawrence and Lecomption, and
this may be in a measure responsible
for the rise at Topeka.

leaving the garrison of the widely
separated forts to their fate.
The campaign began to reach its
climax in the last days of January.
The troops of General P. from
the north and those of General K.
from the east moved against the first
line forts under the most severe
weather
conditions. The Russians
dragged their artillery to the heights
, surrounding the fortress and when all
i was ready began to bombard Forts
! Kara Gudek, 20 miles, and Fort Dalan
Gez, 15 miles northeast of Erzerum,
prepartory to the bayonet assault.
Both Forts Capitulated.
On January 29 both forts capitu
lated. The taking of Dalan Gez made a
breach in the outer line defenses along
the Beve Boinu range in front of the
city. The capture of Kara Gudek
opened a direct passage through the
Karabagas pass to the city proper
from the northeast. Fort Tafta lies
midway between these two fortresses.
In a night attack on January 30 this
fort was captured, leaving only Chaban
Bebe between the two armies operat
ing from this quarter.
On February 1 the Russians began
to storm the whole front line on the

"POT GALLS KETTLE BLACK"

Charge Bank That Loaned to
Growers Was Disciplined.
Washington, Feb. 19. The senate
agriculture committee today decided
to call upon the Continental and
Commercial National bank of Chicago
to submit a statement showing the de
posits of the International Harvester
company for the last three years in
order to determine the truth of
charges that the Harvester company
had disciplined the Chicago bank for
extending financial aid to the sisal
growers of Yucatan.
The committee is investigating
charges that the Harvester company
and the Plymouth- Cordage company
combined to monopolize the sisal out
put and prevent independent twine
dealers from obtaining raw material
and counter charges that the Pan
American Commission corporation, of
which Sol Wexler, a New York bank
er, was the head, financed a sisal mo
nopoly with the idea of putting up the
price to American merchants.
Threats Kept Rack Loans.
The committee has been told that
the Pan-American corporation was not
formed until the planters had been
unable to make loans from independ
ent bankers, who refused because of
alleged t h r eats fro m the Harvester
and Plymouth companies.
Won't Show Records.
Chicago, Feb. 19. Arthur Reyn
olds, vice president of the Continental
and Commercial National bank, when
informed of the decision of the senate
committee to ask for a statement from
the bank showing the International
Harvester company's deposits, said to
day the request would be refused.
"We question the authority and jur
isdiction of the senate committee and
we refuse to open our books to the
committee until so directed by a com
petent court," said Mr. Reynolds.
"For a long period," continued Mr.
Reynolds, "the International Harvest
er company has carried a considerable
balance with us and there has been no
marked decrease in the amount of the
deposit. I do not consider that the
bank has been 'disciplined' in any
manner by the harvester company."
Charges "Underhanded Gumshoe.
Mr. Wexler explained the organiza
tion of the Pan-American commission
corporation, of which he is president,
which guaranteed to loan the Yucatan
planters $10,000,000 a year.
"When I went among the banks of
the country to assure myself that I
could get this money from them when
needed, all but two agreed that if
other conditions justified the loans I
could have them,' he said. "They
were the Continental and Commercial
bank of Chicago and the National
City bank of New York.
"The president and vice president of
the International Harvester company
had gone to them and tried to intimi
date them with threats of withdraw
ing their deposits and withdrawing
their representative from the board
of directors.
And further, this entire propa
ganda to arouse the farmers against
the sisal growers conducted through
the trade journals and by mouth has
been started by the harvester com
pany, in its underhanded, gumshoe
way."
Opposed Prison Twine.
Senator Gronna, of North Dakota,
declared that he had received many
letters from farmers in his state, urg
ing him to advocate laws forbidding
interstate commerce to binder twine
manufactured in the various state
penitentiaries.
Wexler testified that the prison
twine factories were the chief inde
pendent buyers of sisal.

London. Feb. 19. The complete
conquest of the Kamerun, the German
colony in equatorial Africa, was offi

Tt was officially announced in Lon
don on February 17 that the comman
der of the entente forces in the
Kamerun had reported that the con
quest of this German possession was
complete with the exception of the
isolated position of Mora Hill. This
position, according to a semi-official
announcement from Berlin on Feb

German forces under Captain von
Raben, who before the fall of Yaunde,
in the southwestern part of the colony,
had succeeded in sending to the Ger

in which it was declared that the na

than surrender.
Mora Hill is in the northmost sec

of a prominent citizen whose better
half is "resting" at Palm Beach. Then
it was decided ta band for "mutual
protection." There was some trepida
tion when it came to the selection of
officers and not one would permit
himself to be chosen until a vow of j
secrecy was taken by all.
Meetings will be held in the home :
of any member whose wife Is "in the j
country" as frequently as the president J
deems prudent
Thirty-four husbands, all promi-
nent, have joined and the president !
