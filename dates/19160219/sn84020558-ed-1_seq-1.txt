While full details of the capture of
Erzerum, Turkish Armenia, are still
lacking, semi-official advices from
Petrograd arc to the effect that most
of the Turkish garrison made their
escape. Thousands of Armenians are
declared to have been massacred by
Kurds before thevevacuation.
There had been considerable artil
lery activity around the positions tak
en by the Germans recently from the
British in the vicinity of Ypres and
several attempts by the British to re
capture their lost ground by infantry
attacks. Berlin says the attacks were
repulsed with heavy casualties. With
the exception of a French assault
against the Germans south of the
Somme, which Berlin also declares
was put down, the artillery of both
sides have been the sole instrument
of warfare along the French front.
The Austrians and Italians at vari
ous points are still engaged in ar
tillery duels and occasional infantry
maneuvers, but no notable victories
have been won by either side. Vienna
reports more activity than usual on
the part of the Italian guns.

multuous wonca occurred in the Okla- 1
homa house of representatives late to- j
day while the members were voting on
a section of an election law, designed!
to take the place of the famous "Grand-
father law" which was recently de-
dared unconstitutional by the I'nited
States supreme court because it in
effect disenfranchised the neyro pop
ulation of the state.
Partisan feeling over the new mea- I
sure finally culminated in an outbreak,
precipitated by charges of corruption
and the passing of the ,lie between
members, during which ink bottles,
paper weights and other fixtures of
the members desks were used as wea
pons and a set battle seemed inevit
able as democrats massed and ad
vanced toward the republicans and so
cialists. Arthur S. Geissler, chairman
of the republican state central com

dered unconscious by Representative

The proposed law is the product of

Republican A. P. Leased Wire
WASHINGTON, Feb. IS. Germany's
response to the latest request of the
I'nited States for assurances that sub
marine warfare will be conducted in
accordance with established principles
of international law is expected here
to lie a flat statement that assurances
previously given in the Lusitania and
Arazie cases had to do only with un
armed vessels, and that the German
government must feel certain that its
submarines whirl, warn a merchant
ship will not be attacked. Further
more the Berlin foreign office probab
ly will ask the United States for its
definition of defensive armament.
Indications of what the German re
ply may be. are understood to have
been given in informal conversations
between state department officials and
Teutonic diplomats since Germany and
Austria announced their intention of
sinking all limed enemy merchantmen
niter February I'D.
The l"nit?d States today made its
first formal declaration that it does not
accept as legal the announced inten
tions of the Teutonic powers when Um
state department sent to diplomatic
and consular representatives abroad
for their information, notification that
this government considers that mer
chant ships have a right to carry de
fensive armament. The dispatches
contained excerpts from newspaper ar
ticles setting forth the position of the
I'nited States. In this connection it
becam known that the Swedish gov
ernment had instructed its consular
officers to advise till Swedish subjects;
preparing to embark on vessels of the
entente allies of the warnings given
by Germany and Austria.
U is considered certain that the
question of defining defensive arma
ment will b the basis of lengthy ne
gotiations with ti e central powers
ginning when the reply ' received to
the message outlining the views of the
I'nited States which Count von Bern

length the views explained to him by

not expected before th? last of next
week.

conduct of submarine warfare after the

NEW YORK, Feb. IS Extraordi
nary precautions were taken by tha
police tonight to protect guests at the
Knights of Columbus hall at Madison
Square Garden from possible attack
by anarchists. Letters purporting to
have been written by Jean Crones,
the fugitive Chicago chef, suspected of
having puisoned the soup which was
served at the banquet in honor o
Archbishop Mundelein, have contained
threats which led to the fear that
some attempt might be made upon
the lives of those who attended the
dance.
More than three score officers in
plain clothes mingled with the guests.
Two men were stationed on each fire
escape on the building, and every
door was carefully guarded. Detec
tives worked as cooks, waiters and.
dish washers to spy on tiie other
workers. Inspector Cray of the de
tective bureau was pivsent in person.
Guards also were thrown around
police headquarters in the hope that
Crones might make another of the
visits boasted about by the writer of
the letters signed with his name. De
tectives secreted themselves in dark
ened doorways across the streets on
all sides of the building. Others
scrutinized carefully every person
who approached.
Another letter supposedly written by
Crones was received tonight by the
New York Times. Like the two which
preceded it, it was mailed in this city.
The writer gives what he says are ad
ditional details of the Chicago poison
plot, asserting that he did not put
poison into the soup served at the din
ner but put it into the stock in the cold
meat room, where he was employed.
He denies that there were explosives
in his room or that he knew of plans
for the destruction of public buildings
and other acts of violence. The letter
writer announced that he would remain
in New York only forty-eight- hours
longer.

Captain Josiah McKean of the staff of

Captain McKean also said the French
navy was from 15 to 25 percent strong
er than the American, according to
latest information. He explained that
these were rough estimates, and that
charts showing the specific relations
of the various navies would be sub
mitted later by Hear Admiral Benson,
the chief of operations.
So far as is definitely known, the
captain told the committee, the Japan
ese building program adopted several
years ago and which will not Vie com
pleted for several years to come, pro
vides for a' modern fleet of eight
dreadnaughts and eight battle cruisers.
It was possible, he addel, that addi
tional building was in progress as all
nations but the I'nited States had se
cret building policies. On the strength
of the known program, however, Cap
tain McKean said, Japan would have
but sixteen capital ships when the
seventeen American dreadnaughts
built, building or authorized, was com
missioned. The witness disagreed with Admiral
Grant, chief of submarines, who pre
ceded him, as to the advisability of
abandoning the smaller submarine type
in favor of 800 ton boats. Be believed
thirty of the large boats should be
built and attached, to the fleets, but
that smaller ones should operate from
shore bases established at frequent in
tervals along the coasts.
