MMlfGGER
FORCtS UNITED
TO DEFEAT HIM
Opposition Has Centralized
its Energy in Support of
H.H. Perry.
OLSON A FACTOR
OF UNKNOWN POWER
Duis, Whitehead, Perry,
Wilson and McLean
Groups Join Hands.
(By Staff Correspondent.)
Minot, N. D., Feb. 18.—Confronted
by a combination of democratic lead
ers who are representative of prac
tically every element Individually op
posed to him when he was made na
tional committeeman four years ago,
John Bruegger of Wllllston, national
committeeman of the democratic par
ty, has the fight of his life on his
hands Just now.
Concentrating their strength on H.
H. Perry of Ellendale, present chair
man of the state democratic central
committee, the anti-Bruegger men
are right now satisfied that they will
poll the majority of the vote cast
March 21—on which date the commit
teeman for the next four years will
be named.
The anti-Bruegger men base their
hope for success on the election of
four years ago. At that time, Brueg
ger, with a total vote in the state of
only about 2,600, was made commit
teeman, although there were about
12,000 democratic votes cast.
Bruegger'B success was made pos
sible through a combination of his
forces with those of the former na
tional committeeman, William Col
lins, united against a Held of candi
dates that Included George E. Duls
of Grand Forks, Frank Wlllson of
Bathgate, Fred McLean of Fargo and
H. H. Perry of Ellendale, and Ben
Whitehead of Wllllston.
Now the Duis, McLean, Wlllson,
Whitehead and Perry forces are uni
ted in their support of Perry. At
least, the leaders of those five demo
cratic Independencies are united—
and they can see no reason why they
should not be able to poll, united, a
vote nearly as great as the total poll
ed by those Ave candidates did indi
vidually poll in 1912.
If they can do this, Bruegger is
beaten, and his lieutenants thorough
ly realiiQ .that faetr There is the can
didacy of William Olson of Valley
City, sponsored by the so-called
Equity, faction of the democratic .par
ty, to 'be contended' with',' b'jut such
vote as he polls' may be taken from
the. Bruegger strength, as well as
from his opponent.
The great issue presented to the
democratic voters in the coming elec
tion is that of the local committee's
right to the distribution of federal
patronage. It was on this score that
the state central committee did a his
toric thing at Grand Forks recently
when It unanimously voted for the
maintenance of the county commit
tee's authority to recommendation of
postoffice candidates, as opposed to
the right of the national committee
man to dictate the appointments.
This issue came before the state
committee as a result of the attempt
of National Committeeman Byuegger
to override the recommendations of
the 'Ward county committee in the
matter of naming a postmaster at
Kenmare. Ole Toffner, the nominee
of the county committee, was not ac
cepted by Bruegger, and the latter
made three other recommendations to
the postoffice department. Each was,
in its turn, rejected, and Toftner's ap
pointment several days ago makeB the
victory of the county committee over
Bruegger quite complete.
The developments in the appoint
ment of the collector of customs for
the North Dakota and South Dakota
district are not particularly conducive
to good feeling among the democrats
of the state.
On a Saturday, press dispatches
from Washington carried the an
nouncement that D. H. McArthur had
been recommended for the position of
collector. Monday afternoon, the
press reports brought announcement
of the appointment of Alexander
Morrison of Bathgate as the collec
tor.
Between Saturday night and Mon
day afternoon, there had been some
right tall' work on the part of North
Dakota democracy. The treasury de
partment at Washington was flooded
with telegrams from all sections of
North Dakota, remonstrating at the
McArthur appointment. The anti
McArthur forces took the fight to-the
national democratic committee offi
cers, urging them to Interpose in op
position to McArthur, and it is under
stood the national committee officials

Ansonla, Ky., Feb. 19.—JoW
Orohol, a youth Just out of high
school, who speaks seven languages,
holds the balance' of p'owfcr 'in the
strike situation here, where over
4,000 persons are idle as the result
of a strike of 2,500 employes of the
various mills of the American Brass
company.
Grohol was able to control men of
eleven nationalities and he was
made chairman of a committee that
will officially present demands to
company officials at a meeting this
afternoon.
Grohol is not an employe of the
concern. He addressed a mass meet
ing of the strikers last night and im
pressed upon them the necessity of
peace and order. As a result the
situation was calm at a late hour
and the force of 90 extra policemen
had nothing to do.

THE PRESDENT
Chinese Executive Sees Lit
tle Difficulty Controlling
Rebellion.
Peking, Feb. 19.—In an exclusive
interview with the correspondent of
the Associated Press at the palace,
President Yuan Shi Kai minimised
the importance of the rebellion now in
progress and expressed the confidence
of the ability of the'government to
suppress the uprising when adequate
troops reach the upper Tang Tse Kl
ang. Vice Admiral Tsai Ting Kan, con
fidential secretary of Tuan Shi Kai,
acted at interpreter.
"This is no campaign, but only a
skirmish," said Tuan Shi Kai, "but it
gives me so much work that It in
creases my appetite."
The president replied laughingly to
the remark regarding his excellent
physical condition and good spirits,
refuting rumors of ill-health. Discus
sing his enthronement, he said:
"Although a date in February was
sanctioned, the enthronement could
not take place because of the Tunnan
rebellion, which necessitated military
operations. Therefore, it was decided,
with saddened hearts, to postpone it."
The president said the drafting of
the new constitution would be begun
in a few days. When it is finished the
constitution will go before the nation
al convention for suggestions. He did
not predict any date of promulgation
of the constitution.

President of Swiss Federa
tion Sees Continued
Paris, Feb. 1,#.—Camilie De Cop
pet. president of' the Swiss federation,
says that there Js no crisis in Switzer
land involving the political unity of
the country, according to the Berne
correspondent of the Journal, with
whom M. De Coppet discussed agita
tion aroused in Switzerland by dis
closures made during the Investiga
tion of the case against two Swiss col
onels, arrested on charges of com
municating military secrets.
"Switzerland .of tomorrow will be
the same Switzerland of yesterday."
said the president. :"The sympathies
entertained by the Swiss for foreign
causes simply, show that they are
using fully their constitutional liberty
to think as they. like. Should a move
ment of assimilation take place on our
borders, it would be a movement of
endosmosis, as we say of physics,
rather than. exosmosis. In other
words, our neighbors are far more
likely to become Swiss than are the
Swiss to enter into the life of the
belligerent nations."

Sheboygan, wfeT Feb. 19.—Miss
Delia Sahf6rd,.*vfyiM£!iold, for seven

at Sheboygan Falls, was found yes
terday with a bullet wound under her
right temple. A short time before,
she had a dispute with Postmaster
Wilderuth, and left the office hurried
ly. Her resignation, which had been
posted, has been received by the post
master.
Friends of Miss Sanford assert that
the bullet wound was received in an
accident. Miss Sanford, who lives
alone, refused to give an explanation
of her injury.
Physicians have hopes of her re
covery.
The association elected P. M. Casey
of Lisbon and A. L. Maxwell of Turtle
Lake as members of the board of di
rectors, to succeed themselves. No
selection was made of a secretary to
succeed J. M. Anderson, who will re
tire from the position because of the
vast amount of other business with
which he has to deal.
Committee on Finance.
The committee on finance, to con
duct a portion of the work in connec
tion with the establishment of the
new packing plant, consists of E. G.
Quamme, Louis Miltemelr, G. S. You
mans, C. J. Lee and J. C. Leum.
The Packing Plant.
The special packing plant commit
tee reported in favor of the establish
ment of a plant located in such man
ner that it would afford the greatest
possible service. It also was proposed
that several such plants be establish
ed ultimately.
As a means of bringing about suc
cess. the committee suggested that co
operating shipping associations be
formed, as the greatest portion of the
plant's products must come from such
organisations.
The fact that the packing plant
committee engaged in the task of con
sidering locations for the proposed
plant is not being provided even with
its expenses, was brought to the at
tention of the convention yesterday af
ternoon, with the result that a special
finance committee was appointed to
consider the proposition. This ,com
mittee, made up of five members, will
study the methods of financing the
plant, and the preliminary organiza
tion work.

time and money in the work. Now,
It was pointed out, there was need for
some step for the handling of the
proposition on a basis where the com
mittee members would not be out of
pocket financially.
E. G. Quamme, of Finley, presented
an interesting sidelight on the packing
plant proposition. Mr. Quamme de
olared it was the purpose of the equity
folks to establish a plant In which
both the consumers and the producers
will be interested. In this way, with
both being stockholders, the products
would receive a greater degree of
publicity, and it would be a means of
promoting the sale.
Grant S. Youmans, of Minot, point
ed out the financial proposition which
confronted the committee, and declar
ed it would be advisable to take steps
to reimburse the committee members.
Growth of Shipping.
The great growth of independent
cattle shipping to the South St. Paul
market was revealed by J. E. Monk
man, of the J. R. Kirk Commission
Co., of South St. Paul, In an address
to the convention. In 1912, independ
ent shipping was practically unheard
of. In 1918, there were 2,200 cars In
1914, there were 8,600, while in 1916
there were 6,200 carloads of cattle
shipped through co-operative associa
tions.
Under the shipping association
plans, the farmers Join hands In mak
ing up a carload of cattle, and in that
manner they get the price, minus the
commission, for which the cattle are
sold at the market.
This scheme eliminates the specula
tive buyer, who is rapidly becoming a
thing of the past In the stock busi
ness.
