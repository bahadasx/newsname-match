GRAYSON ADVISER
TO THEPRESIDENT
White House Doctor Mao of
Ability and Tact,

able as Diplomat and Practitioner.
Washington.It's a sweet little Job,
these days, being private and personal
physician to the president of the Unit
ed States. From a medical viewpoint
it's not a particularly trying post, but
the position embraces about flfty-seven
other tasks, all calling for the tact,
memory and general ability of a cor
poration counsel.
Slipping in and out of the White
House, a little man with a keen, In
cisive eye and manner of speech, but
withal an affability of manner which
Immediately attracts attention, can
often be seen these days. His name Is
Cary T. Grayson, and his name carries

DR. CARY T. GBAYBON.
with it the initials "TJ. S. N.,' which
means he is a member of the medical
corps of the navy.
Grayson is the man who brought the
position of presidential doctor out of
obscurity and elevated it to a post of
honor, dignity and efficiency in White
House circles. Before Grayson came a
White House doctor was a mysterious
personage, little known and less cared
about. Graysou combines this position
with the one left vacant by the Jate
Major Archibald Butt and fills both
with complete satisfaction.
On the whole, the practice of medi
cine on the president of the United
States is the least of Grayson's tasks.
He's a sort of confidential family ad
viser to President Wilson, and he also
regulates the president's office hours
and sometimes his statements to re
porters. When the president is away
from Washington, Grayson is often
times the sole connecting link between
the head of the American nation and
the representatives of the American
press.
In more ways than one this black
haired, pleasant faced, affable man
nered, efficient man has attained dis
tinction and a record during the time
Woodrow Wilson has occupied the
White House. He is usually spoken
of as "Dr. Cary T. Grayson, U. S. N.,
the president's personal physician," but
that's merely the correspondents* meth
od of repaying In formality 4be in
formal, gracious kindnesses of the
president's doctor.
In size Grayson is a small man, but
that doesn't apply to his ability. He
has a long, straight nose, jet black
hair and deep set eyes that twinkle
with humorous appreciation half the
time. Sometimes they don't twinkle,
but that's when Grayson is "on the
road" with his distinguished patient,
and the responsibility of his position at
such a time is apt to take the twinkle
from any one's eyes.
The president is an indefatigable
worker, and like all men of his tem
perament he has the habit of neglect
ing bis personal health when Involved
in a deep and delicate problem. Gray
on, however, is always hovering In
the background, guarding him against
overwork, driving him forth to the
golf links or for an automobile ride,
urging plenty of sleep, a careful diet
and all the other details necessary to
a president's health.
These are a part of his duties when
the president is at home. Grayson's
duties at such times become compara
tively light, and he is enabled to take
up his other work at the Naval hos
pital at Washington, where he has a
regular quota of patients who demand
his attention so long as he remains in
the city.
But when the president takes to his
private car for a swift whirl to New
York, to Cornish or elsewhere, Gray
son suddenly stands forth as the czar
of the executive's private car. Gray
son Is strong on the point of exercise.
He insists that the president take ex
ercise at any and all times, and the
president fortunately, when the mat
ter Is brought to bis attention. Is al
ways willing to exercise. "J%

C. N. Nelson, who lives just over the
Anoka county line, a few miles from
St. Paul, says.
Thirty-two years ago, when he was
in the early twenties, Nelson landed in
Minnesota fresh from Sweden. His
total assets were 50 cents and the con
tents of a queer looking Swedish
clothes chest. Half an hour after his
arrival he was 50 cents poorer.
"When I got off a train in Minne
apolis all I had to direct me was a
card bearing the address of a cousin
who had come to America a short
time before." Mr. Nelson said. "I
showed the card to a hackman. who
also was Swedish. He took my 50
cents and drove me a few blocks,
pointing to one of the windows,
marked 444, said. 'There it is.' I had
supposed that the 'box 444' written on
the card was a street address. I did
not know how my cousin was to ap
pear from that box. but 1 stood with
eyes glued on the number from 10
o'clock in the morning until the middle
of the afternoon, afraid to look else
where for fear my cousin would come
in the meantime.
"When at last 1 heard two men at
one of the windows talking my lan

explained that 1 was in the postoffice
and that my cousin might not go there
for several days. I should have been

"Then I worked in a railroad con

Appreciation Shown For Her
Efforts In Feeding Aliens.
Berlin.Mrs. Gerard, wife of the
American ambassador here, is appeal
ing to her friends at home for funds
to carry on the American relief kitch
en of Berlin, which has daily fed some
200 women and children, the families
of men who are aliens in Germany and
therefore placed in concentration
camps, following the action which
Great Britain and France took in the
internment of aliens in those countries.
The American Association of Com
merce and Trade in Berlin gave the
money to run ^he kitchen for six
months when its doors were opened
last year in the quaint little building
in the Schlesische strasse, where Mrs.
Gerard and her committee of Ameri
can ladies found an unoccupied bouse
in the factory district of the east side.
Mrs. Gerard herself gave the coal sup
ply for the winter, so that the place
was kept open all afternoon, many of
the women and children having no
other place where they could keep
warm. The money was spent so eco
nomically that $1 furnished seven
wholesome meals.
This winter the enterprise is without
funds, and the doors of the American
relief kitchen have not been opened to
the crowds of hungry, poorly clad wo
men with babies in their arms and
clinging to their skirts who mournful
ly stand around and gaze through the
windows.
Long purses and generous ones
among the American colony have been i
taxed to the utmost by the charity
needs arising from the war, and Mrs.
Gerard has won appreciation not only
in Berlin, but throughout Germany for
her large contributions of money and
the devotion of almost all* of her time
to the alleviation of distress. On Nov.
11 the German government sent her
Red Cross decorations of the first and
second class to commemorate her serv- I
ices In connection with the effort to
help German prisoners of war in Rus

Boston.The National Association
For the Advancement of Colored Peo
ple starts the year 1916 with many
great problems before it for solution.
The success of the work the past year
was in many ways verjr gratifying to
the board of directors and other of its
officials, but with lynchings on the In
crease and many stubborn cases of
segregation to fight the association
must use every means at its command
in order to create a stronger sentiment
in favor of giving justice to all citizens
not because of their color, but because
it is right and In accord with the fun
damental law of this republic.
The big public event of the associa
tion for the third week in February
will be a great mass meeting, to be held
in the Park Street church, Boston, on
Tuesday, Feb. 22. at whicfythe second
Spingarn medal will be presented by
Governor McCall to the man or woman
DB. J. B. SPINGARN
of our race selected as having made
the most distinguished achievement
during the preceding twelve months.
The Spingarn medal, the gift of Dr
J. B. Spingarn of New York, formerly
professor of comparative literature in
Columbia university and chairman of
the board of directors of the National
Association For the Advancement of
Colored People, is a gold medal of the
value of $100 and is awarded annually
to the American Negro who has ren
dered the most distinguished service
during the year in any field of honor
able or elevated endeavor.
The award committee consists of two

The first medal was awarded in Feb
ruary, 1915, to Dr. Edward E. Just,
professor in the Howard University
Medical school, for distinguished work
In biological research. It was present
ed to him by Governor Whitman of
New York before an enormous au
dience In New York city. The incident
received an unusual amount of public
ity in the press throughout the coun

mented widely on the fact that a medal
to a Negro was awarded for scientific
attainments.
The recipient of the second medal
will not be announced until Governor
McCall presents It to him in the Park
Street church on Washington's birth
day. It is expected that several other
speakers of national reputation will
make addresses at the same meeting.
The Spingarn medal may be said to
be the most distinguished recognition
which a colored man receives in this
country for scholarly attainments and
distinguished service.
The meeting at the Park Street
church will be held under the auspices
of the National Association For the
Advancement of Colored People, of
which Mr. Moorfield Storey of Boston

MEDAL FOR OBSTINACY.
Two Farmers Are Entered In the Con

Kansas City.Two of the most con
trary men in Kansas are boasted by
Smith Center. Last fall one man re
fused to pay the price asked by corn
buskers and vowed he would let his
field rot before be would yield.
Now the field, containing about 2,000
bushels of gram, still stands and is
grown up with a dense crop of sun
flowers.
The other contrary man is a neigh
bor of the first He husked 1,000 bush
els of his crop, stored it In an uncov

there till it brought him 75 cents a
bushel. It Is still there, but ruined by
the season's heavy rains.
FARMER'S IDEA SAVES
HIM TIME AND MONEY
Uses Pipe to Send Wheat From
Plateau to Market.
Wenatchee, Wash.Instead of haul
ing his wheat eighteen miles over a
bad road, as he did formerly, James
Keane of Rock Island is now letting
the grain slide into market through a
galvanized iron pipe. The former
method cost from 15 to 20 cents a
bushel to market By this latter way
the grain can be handled for 2 cents
a bushel.
The new system has been in opera
tion for a couple of years and bids fair
to continue, at least until the natural
law of gravitation is abolished.
Keane owns land which lies on a
large plateau over 2,000 feet above the
little town of Rock Island. It has al
ways been expensive for the farmer
to drive a long distance to get off the
plateau and back into town, and as
the road wound around the side of the
bluffs it was very rocky and danger
ous.
Two years ago the iron pipe idea
came to Keane. He purchased and in
stalled 2,500 feet of two inch galvaniz
ed iron piping, and the saving the first
year paid for it. The pipe runs from
Keane's west field down a steep hill to
within 400 feet of the warehouse in
the town.
When he wishes to take two or three
loads of wheat to market the gram is
poured into a large sheet iron hopper
fitted over the top of the iron pipe line.
The grain runs along merrily through
the pipe to the town, where it is receiv
ed at the rate of about a sack a min
ute, which is as fast as it can be han
dled.
To save more time and money Keane
has attached an apparatus known as
the "sacker" from a thrashing machine
to the town end of the pipe line,
which automatically receives, sacks
and weighs the grain. A man does the
sewing.
Keane has a monopoly on the big
plateau, which embraces about 5,000
acres of tillable land. Last year be
planted most of it and harvested near
ly 100.000 bushels of wheat
The land lies exposed to the periodi
cally hard winds that frequent this
part of the state during the summer,
and there have been years when part
of the wheat crop would be piled In
high drifts of dirt When the season
)s favorable few farmers are more
handily located than Keane. with bis

IN FAVOR OF CONSCRIPTION.
America Should Adopt System, Says
Harriot Stanton Blatch.
Washington.Mrs. Harriot Stanton
Blatch, president of the Woman's Po

says:
"I am of the opinion that America
should adopt the only democratic na

"I would have conscription on a plan
somewhat similar to that enforced in
Switzerland at the present timean
two months at first to
continue periods each year
a system that would harmonize all
sections of our country. In my opin
ion we want to be made a much more
homogeneous people, and therefore
those that enlist from the east should
be sent to the west and those from the
south sent to the north, and a perfect
understanding would be brought about
between various sections.
"This conscription imposed upon men
should also be obligatory for women,
who as citizens, but not as soldiers,
should know how to^elflclently do their
share in coming to the aid of their
country in time of calamity.
"Girls should be forced to tram In
various departments of the civil serv
ice, in the postoffices, in all the mu
nicipal departments, and to women I
would apply the same ideas as to the
menthat is to say, send them to va
rious parts of the country, so that they

WIRELESS VISION
SEEN BY TESLA
Thinks "World System" Will
Allow Many toTalk at Once.
ENDS STATIC DISTURBANUE
Inventor Also Hopes to Transmit Pic
tures by Same Medium Which Car
ries the VoiceDeclares It Will Bs
Possible to Hold Secret Conversation
Too. New York.Nikola Tesla announced
that he had received a patent on an in
vention which would not only elimi
nate static interference, the present
bugaboo of wireless telephony, but
would enable thousands of persons to
talk at once between wireless stations
and make it possible for those talking
to see one another by wireless, regard
less of the distance separating them
He said also that with his wireless sta
tion now in the process of construction
on Long Island he hoped to make New
York one of the central exchanges in a
world system of wireless telephony.
The inventor, who has won fame by
his electrical inventions, dictated this
statement:
"The experts carrying out this bril
liant experiment are naturally deserv
ing of great credit for the skill thev
NIKOia. TSSUl.
have s*iown in^perfecting the devices.
These are of two kindsfirst, those
serving to control transmission, and
second, those magnifying the received
impulse. That the control of transmis
sion is perfect is plain to experts from
the fact that the Arlington, Mare island
and Pearl Harbor plants are all inef
fective and that the distance of tele
phonic communication is equal to that
of telegraphic transmission. It is also
perfectly apparent that the chief merit
of the application lies in the magnifica
tion of the microphonic Impulse. It
must not be imagined that we deal
here with new discoveries. The im
provement simply concerns the control
of the transmitted and the magnifica
tion of the received impulse, but the
wireless system is the same. This can
never be changed.
"It Is claimed that static disturbance
will fatally interfere with the trans
mission, while as a matter of fact there
is no static disturbance possible In
properly designed transmission and re
ceiving circuits. Quite recently I have
described in a patent circuits which are
absolutely immune to static and other
interferences, so much so that when a
telephone is attached there is absolute
silence, even lightning in the immediate
vicinity not producing a click of the
diaphragm, while in the ordinary tele
phonic conversation there are all kinds
of noises.
"Another contention is that there can
be no secrecy in wireless telephone con
versation. I say it is absurd to raise
this contention, when it is positively
demonstrated by experiments that the
earth is more suitable for transmission
than any wire could ever be. A wire
less telephone conversation can be
made as secret as a thought
"I have myself erected a plant for
the purpose of connecting by wireless
telephone the chief centers of the
world, and from this plant as many as
a hundred will be able to talk absolute
ly without interference and with abso
lute secrecy. The plant would simply
be connected with the telephone cen
tral exchange in New York city, and
any subscriber will be able to talk to
