CLEVER WOMEN IN
"THE IRON STRAIN."
Enid Markey, Louise Glaum
and Truly Shattuck Asso
ciated With Dustin Far
num in Alaskan Romance
In putting forth the Alaska
love story called '-The Iron
Strain" as bis flret contribution
to the new Triangle progiam,
Thomas il Ince bas brought to
gel her the most talented women
of his studio in the company of
Dustin Farnum. who plays the
leading iole. Mr. Farnnm's lead
ing woman is Miss Enid Markey,
who is associated with "social
butteifly" ty pes and knows bow
to play them effeciively. Mr.
luce intrusted the soubrette role
to Louise Glaum, ordinarily a
leading woman but here playing a
subordinate part in older to pro
vide a perfect ensemble Even
Truly Shattuck, the feiner star
of musical comedy and prima
donna of light opera, appears in
the minor role of Enid's mother.
Th-'strength of the cast on the
ruasculice side is indicated by
the fact that Charles K French
plays the Alaska mining king,
Ezra Whitney There are also
two Indian characters, which aie
splendidly enacted by real red
shins. Here is the story:
Octavia Van Ness, a Man Fran
cisco social butfeiflv, is taken to
Alaska for her healt h. where she
meets Chuck Hemming way. She
r* pulses his advances, arid he
steals the girl, enteis into a
forced mariiage with her and in
stalls her in his cabin. Six
months elapse, and the girl, now
strong and well, is still antago
nistic to Chuck. Kitty Molloy,
soubrette of the Arctic dance
hall, arrives in the village, and
Octavia's jealousy is excited, and
for the first time she loves he
husband. They returned to Cali
foroia and are reunited with the
girl's parents.
This is a story of strikingly
contrasted character types, of
the difference between artificial
society and outdoor nature, of
forceful worth and social vanity
It gripped the spectators very
closely when it was played re
cently in the Triangle theaters of
New York, Chicago and Pbila
delphia, and it is bound to excite
equal interest here at the Elks on
February 25th. "The Iron
"Strain," by the way, is only one
feature of the extensive program
of offerings.

Licking a postage «tamp may
be the first step towards a tuber
culosie camp, aud chewing a pen
oil that somebody elle may have
used, bear all the possibilities of
an early funeral for the ohewsv.
These are oonolnsiona to ba
drawn from a recent address by
Dr. Samuel G. Dixon, state health
commissioner of Pennsylvania.
Millions of people moisten postage
stamps with their tongues every
day. These may have been sfaov.
ed across a soiled counter or torn
off with dirty bands an instant
before, but, unfortunately, a
habit, plus convenience, leads the
majority of people to the custom
of affixing them in this manner.
In view of the fact that there are
thousands of sufferers from tu
berculosis and other diseases,
these seemingly insignificant acta
ere fraught with danger.—Ex.

Dear Sir:—"Year letter to
Messrs.--of tbts city
was turned over to ns for reply.
Hardly think it would pay to
réieeeaetor beans in Texas. It
has been tried in the vicinity of
Houston e number of years ago,
also, adjacent to Weatherford,
and given op for the reason that
tha yield is too small (only sight
to ten bushels per sere) and labor
ia too expensive in this country.
They oan be raised much oheaper
India where labor is worth
from fifteen to twenty five cents
per day in silver and ocean

And stiiDwe are not satisfied
and shall be glad to learn what
farmers who knew anything

eight to ten bushels per acre as a
maximum possibility down tbit
