L-- Reaching a port of the United States, lie attempted to enlist in the Union army in the great
war, but his sea captain, who liked him, put an estoppel on that by giving away the fact that he was
under age.
He Anally reached California, from where in 1867 he drifted to Nevada. For a time he was "con
struction boss" on-the old C. P. railroad, which was then being built down the eastern slope of the
Sierras, between Truckee and where Reno now is.
The lure of the Comstock soon attracted him and he went to Virginia City. He at once found
employment in the mines, a little later obtained the contract to sink the Caledonia shaft and still
later he sank air-shaft No. 3 over the Sutro tunnel. Ho was engaged on the Comstock all through

Think of it! We are

east, forty-five hundred 4 ,H
miles from any possible H
foe on the west We , H
have a navy enough to H
biitertain any force that ' M
