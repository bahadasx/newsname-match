PITTSBURG, Feb. 19?The Glass-!

A general comprehensive idea of;
existing conditions in the window

following circular letter just issued
by the Johnson Brokerage Company,
of Pittsburg:
To the trade:
This is one occasion during the last;
i four years in which we are oarnestly,
I soliciting orders. From the assign- (
I monts we have made during the last!
six weeks it Is our belief that with j
i all the plants operating full handed j
it will take them until the early part,
of April to complete present contracts
and there Is much friction on the part
' of labor that It may become serious
enough at any tline to curtail production.
This creates a feeling of uni
onsness among the jobbers who really
understand the situation,
i ' Home business is coming In on the ,
January schedule?a much larger I
quantity than we expected In the early

Strangely enough, none of the'

some from the Short Line passenger |

The snappers employed at the Sa-|

at Salem.
The officers of the local are Morris
Hill, president; Harland Chlttester,

A project Is on foot to also organize
the snappers employed at, Penns-;

those who will want glass during the [
summer to get their orders In early, 1 t
as even at best there may be delay r
In making deliveries. Any new busl- ,.s
ness placed would be filled in proper
order, and those who had glass purchased

would be all shipped before!
the higher priced business went for- i i

With only a couple of months for!

if there might be some difficulty in

In popular sizes. And a most sur- '

small glass has practically all been 1

aging to Judge Robinson, The peo- J
pie who elected him to the hiaheBtH
court in the state did it because they
know that Judge Robinson could not j
be controlled in that position by po-;
liticnl or other interests. They know 1
he was the kind of n man to make a'
great judge and lie amply justified
their confidence. lie will prove as '
governor just as he did as judge. '
This accusation by Judge nobinson's
opponents is pure rot. You can't
fool the people of West Virginia
with that sort of a campaign. It is
bound to fail." 1
"Besides," said Elkins, and he
laughed as be said it, 'do you suppose
if Judge Robinson was likely to be '
controlled by Hatflcld or any other,
I would be supporting him. Well,
hardly. But I am for him first, last
and all the time. He will be swoeplngly

MEN'S MEETI
CENTER OF
DURING GRE.
4
Attendance on Sunday Afternoons
in Methodist Church
is without Precedent.
MASS MEETING TOMORROW
Confidently Expected That at
Least Fifteen Hundred Men
Will Be at Services.
The greatest religious revival In
the history of the local First Methodist
Esplcopal church is still going 011
with interest una hated and results of
a most gratifying and surprising nature.
The absence of Dr. Morrison has
not lessened the interest In any sense
and the work, which in now entirely
in the hands of the pastor, Dr. King,
is progressing wonderfully. While
the meetings are announced as far
ahead as Tuesday night, It is generally
the accepted' belief that they
will continue a much greater period.
Dr. King's preaching here has won I
a multitude of udmirlng friends, ana
his plain, blunt manner of handling
the common evils of the day Is quite
In keeping with the policy of the local
Methodists. He sees no middlepoint
upon which to compromise and
knows no halfway sinners. It Is either
good or bad and all else is hypocrisy.
Such sermons are bound to win In
the end as they are but commonsense
viewing of the . teachings of
Christ.
The Interest In men's meetings, or
they are generally termed, "meetings
for men only," has grown from
service to servlcu, until today there
Is a feeling In this vicinity that thoy
should be adopted as a regular service
of the church.
It Is confidently expected that at
leaBl fifteen hundred men will be In
attendance at the service tomorrow
uilumuuu. 11 in raiimrKuujt; iuutuu
how few non-Christians thore are
among the men of this city, and, another
feature which is quite noticeable
is the fact that there are hut
few left who have not come forward.
The meeting last night was one
which, despite the extremely Inclement
weather, was well attended. The
music was good and the deep religious
spirit which prevailed made- it 1
one to be long remembered.
