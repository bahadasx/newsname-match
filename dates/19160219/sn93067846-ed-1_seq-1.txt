Orangeburg Evening Bun, Monday,
Feb. 14.
At the conclusion of the Ural; week
of the McLendon campaign la this
city, compilation of statistics show
that approximately 13,900 men, wo?
men and children have attended ser?
vices at the tabernacle. Aa the at*
tendance Is increasing every di.y It Is
believed that by the close of the cam?
paign fully 100.000 will have heard
the evangelist.
This great attendance, of course,
means that thousands of venters will
have come to Orangeburg for the
tabernacle services. It meats also
that many persons go to the snrvlcee
In spite of the 'Igor and relentleea
of *fc *oa*s campaign u.gainst
those tat he hates, which
range all the way from liquor to
hypocrisy, the people throng to hear
htm and there le surprisingly little
resentment of what he says. Not
that he Is not taken seriously, but
because they recognise the truth, of
want he says, however much It may
they by no meant constitute the whole
evangelistic program. Cottage prayer
meetings are held each morning in dif?
ferent sections of the city, children's
meetings will be held and meetings
for men in the business district. Bach
Monday Is devoted to trips to nearby
towns where services aro held. Today
the evangelistic party and a numbet
of Orangeburg people, visited Cor?
dova, Cope, Denmark, and Bamberg.
At each of these places services were
held and were largely attended Mon?
day Is the only day on which no ser?
vices are held at the tabernacle. It Is
supposed to be rest day of the party
but the evangelist, forgetful of him?
self, is snxlous to extend the scope of
the campaign as far as possible, and
is using his rest day in preach ing at
other towns.
Tester day morning at 10 o'clock,
Mr. McLendon addreased the numbers
of the Wesley Bible Class of St. Paul's
Church and was heard by a largt num?
ber of men.
Last night the attendance at the
tabernacle Jumped to fully 3,000. Ev?
ery foot of seating space was taken
and many were compelled to stand.
Owing to the rapidly increasing at?
tendance, additional seats were pro?
vided last week for several hundred
more people. The evangelist spoke
last night on "The Ten Command?
ments." The sermon was full of
"pep" as usual and from time to time
the people gasped at the terrillc in?
dictments hurled against many forms
of sin. Idolatory, theft, murder, pro?
fanity, gossip, parental dlsrespcr. and
worldllness were denounced in scath?
ing terms. Under the blistering con?
demnation of the preacher, faces pal?
ed or reddened and heads dropped.
Mr. McLendon stated last night
that the tabernaole here was the sec?
ond ever built in this State for a re?
ligious campaign. The first was in
Sumter but was smaller than the one
in thla city.
A pleasing feature of the service
last night was the singing of "climb?
ing Jacob's Ladder" by Messrs. Mar?
shall and Williams of the McLendon
party. It thrilled the vast throng and
called out hearty applause. Mr. Pledg?
er, the leader Is obtaining splendid
response from the congregation in
the song services and many who have
not sung for years Join In the songs.

i > ?*.???? '
Florence, Feb. Is.?Mrs. R, B. Du*
Boso, wife of the manager of the
j Vaughn Furniture company, was
very seriously injured this morning by
I the explosion of the hot water tank
of her kitchen range. The water
pipee had frozen in the night and
this morning Mrs. DuBose went into
I her kitchen to get some hot water
for her invalid mother, and it is prob
jable that she opened the valves of the
tank which had not been drained
and allowed a rush of cold water into
the pipes of the range, causing the
explosion. The stove was smashed.
Fire, smoke and steam poured out into
the room. Mr. DuBose rushed in,
not knowing that his wife had gone
In there at all, and seeing the cook
out of danger began to fight the fire
in the blinding smoke and steam. He
heard a groan at his feet, and feeling*
along the floor, discovered the body!
of his unconscious wife. He got the
ambulance from the Florence in?
firmary as quickly as possible and the!
victim was given all the assistance
possible. She is badly Injured by the
broken pieces of the iron stove and
the scalding steam. Her face and
head are badly cut, and the complete
loss of one eye is feared.
The physicians at the infirmary
will not make any statement in re?
gard to the case as yet.
There were several other explosions
of hot water tanks due to the sud?
den freezing of the pipes last night,
but this was the only casualty so
far reported.

RUSSIAN AMBASSADOR QUITS.
<
George T. Marye, Envoy to Rusla, Re?
signs Post Because of Physical Con?
dition.
Petrograd, Feb. 16 (via London).?1
The resignation of George T. Marys,
American ambassador to Russia,
which has been sent to Washington,
is regarded as coming at an especial?
ly inopportune moment in view of
the fact that Charles 8. Wilson, the
?rat secretary of the embassy, has
j^eeh transferred and is leaving at
Once for Mac rid* Mr. Marye gave ill
health as thti reason for desiring to
the - embassy stair whose etperten.a
hag placed him in close touch with
the Intimate affairs of the embassy.
Neither of the other two secretaries
has been here more than 10 months.
In expressing regret at the ap?
proaching departure of Mr. Marye,
Foreign Minister Sazonoff voiced the
opinion that the work done by the
ambassador toward bringing about
more cordial relations between Rus?
sia and the United States would bear
fruit immediately after the war,
when the commercial relation! of the
two countries would command closer
attention.
Francis May Succeed.
Washington, Feb. 16.?David R.
Francis of St Louis, former secretary
of the interior and former governor
of Missouri, is understood tonight to
be under serious consideration for
ambassador to Russia to succeed G.
T. Marye. It is not known whether
he will accept the post if It Is offered
to him. Mr. Marye's resignation
which was announced yesterday has
I not yet been accepted, but it was said
I at the state department and the White
House today that it undoubtedly
would be. Ill health is said to be
the reason for his decision to give
up his post.
OBJECT TO MARKED CASES.

quiring That Receptacles be Marked.
Columbia, Feb. 16.?By a vote of
65 to 44 the house this morning re?
fused to recommit the two quart
month bill and passed the measure to
second reading. Tho main objection
manifested in comiiderable debate ad?
iverse to the measure was on section
ten, requiring all valises or other re?
ceptacles for Intoxicants to be plainly
marked. The members say that if one
carried a half pint bottle of liquor in
his pockets in the street under this bill
he would have to so designate on his
person.
Washington, Feb. 15.?Owing to in?
ternational problems President Wil?
son has definitely abandoned his sec?
ond swing around the circle in behalf
of preparedness. He is Impressed with
the belief that tho coming six months
must influence the future of this coun?
try more than any period in the past.
He will devote his time in solving the
delicate situations with the belliger?
ents, among which the armed mer?
chantmen problem seems the most se?
rious, and unless carefully handled
may develop a most ncqute situation
with tho Allies.
SO STATES BERN STQRFF AFTER
CONFERENCE WITH LANSING.
New Note From Berlin Regarded as
"Practically Satisfactory4* and Will
be Submitted to Wilson for Approv
Washington, Feb. 16.?"The Lusi-1
tania incident is as good ae settled. I
believe a complete statement showing
this will be forthcoming from the
State department Friday morning,"
announced Count von Bernstorff, the
German ambassador, after an eleven
minutes' conference with Secretary
Lansing today. He said that Lansing
considers the amended agreement as
submitted by Germany as "practically
satisfactory" and he will submit it to
the president for approval.
LANSING POLICY REVERSED.
United States Will Not Acquiesce in
German Policy Against Armed Mer?
chantmen.
Washington, Feb. 16.?The United
States will continue to press the re?
quest that European belligerents dis?
arm all merchant ships. Although
the president reversed Secretary Lan?
sing's planned policy of acquiescence
'in the proposed Teutonic policy that
merchantmen carrying guns could
be attacked by submarines without
warning, the question will be held
open. The president's reversal of the
secretary was due to Col. House's cable
to the president stating that the re?
versal of the original policy of the
United States permitting liners to car?
ry guns for defense at present would
be dangerous as Great Britain and
France would consider such a step an
unfriendly act.
l MAY AFFECT TOBACCO GROWERS
Expected They May Suffer as Result
Iof Great Britain's Baa on Impor?

r London, Feb. 16.?With two years
supply on hand, both for domestic
'Consumption and manufacture for ex
Iport to other countries, British to
rfed over Ihe order prohlbttlng mv
portations, but they are all speculat?
ing as to what effect it will have
upon American growers.
Tobacco improves with holding and
wholesalers and manufacturers can
wait the resumption of regular com?
merce, but the growers may suffer by
a price slump, It is felt.
The annual domestic consumption
Is about 100,000,000 pounds while
the amount reexported In manufac?
tured form Is 38,000,000 pounds, so
that the 279,000,000 pounds In British
warehouses assures a two-year sup?
ply for the United Kingdom. Ninety
per cent, of this came from the
United States, this amount making
Great Britain Americas' best indivi?
dual customer.

GERMANY 4 $ k PROPOSITION
TONICA A*A FOR LAND.
h
Details of 3? | are Not Known, bat
Senator c?r i This as Reason lor
I Eerly Ratification of Treaty by
America,
Washington, Feb. 14.?That Ger?
many had offered Nicaragua a larger
sum than the United States for an
option on the Nicaraguan canal route
was urged in the senate today as an
argument for early ratification of the
pending treaty.
Several senators said they had been
informed in the course of the debate
that Germany had long sought an op?
tion on the canal route; that efforts
first were made soon after France un?
dertook construction of the canal and
were renewed more recently.
Members of the foreign relations
committee denied reports that there
was documentary evidence in pos?
session of the committee on the sub?
ject.
Of course we have heard such re*
ports that Germany sought to obtain
the Nicaraguan canal route," said Sen?
ator Stone, chairman of the commit?
tee. "Whether she offered $9,000,000
or $12,000,00 or $20,000,000 I do
not know. We have no means of
knowing. That Germany was actuated
by the same motives in seeking this
canal route that France had in the
original Panama enterprise is appar?
ent. Personally I think it would be to
the great political disadvantage of the
United States for any European gor?
ernment to have control of a canal
route across the Pan-American isth?
mus."
Champions of the pending Nicara?
guan treaty are said to have cited
Germany's desires in urging its ratifi
! cation, Nicaragua having agreed ? to
accept the $3,000,000 offered by the
United States for the canal option and
naval base in Fonseca bay.
Senator Stone said late today that
he had deferred asking for a vote on
the treaty until next Thursday, several
Democratic senators having notified
him that they could not be pi
until that time.

BETANCOURT TO LEAVE. \
Colombian Minister Thinks Pact Win
Not be Satisfactory.
Washington, Feb. 14.?Ret gnixing
the probability that the pending treaty
between the United States and his
country will not be ratified by the sen?
ate in its original form, Julio Betan
court, the Colombian minister, has
asked his government for a leave of
absence from Washington. It is under?
stood he will seek permanent with?
drawal if the treaty is rejected or the
senate accepts its foreign relations
committee amendments reducing the
indemnity for the partition of Panama
from $26,000,000 to $15,000,000 and
