flt Washington. - When Count Von
Bernstorff called to confer with Sec
retary Lansing on the Lusitania n'o
gotiations he presented a formal
m communication from his government
contending that under the Prussian
tt American treaty the British diner Ap
t pam, a German prize in Hampton
Roads, should be permitted to remain
he in American waters indefinitely.
At the conclusion of the confer
ence Count Von Bernstorff said:
"Everything Is substantially a!ll
right, but it is not finished."
Secretary Lansing, in reply to In
quirers, sent word from his office that
the negotiations had not advanced
much.
3 It was learned that come altera
Stons which concern the form of the
agreement and are regarded as minor
ones are now to be made, and that
at the change involves sending the pro
e poed agreement to the Berlin foreign
omee.
d Although Count Von Bernstorff has
been negotiating with the greatest
a latitude up to this point, now that I
ie the questions involved concern the
form and final wording of the agree
ment between the two countries, 4
every change, no matter of how minor
ida nature, must be submitted to Ber
iain.
e In the opinion of German omecials,
Y those changes which now are to be I
' made do not alter the effect or sun- I
stance of the agreement, and they
' will be acceptbd by the Berlin foreign

from the scene of hostilities, are on I
the defensive on three important riv- t

A third important Russian advance fi

SECURED.
IT
Washington.-President Wilson has
practically won his fight for ratifilca
tion of the Nicaraguan treaty in the
executive session of the Senate. Some
I of its most vigorous opponents said
the administration had won enough
votes to command the necessary two
thirds, and they predicted its ratifi
cation.
The administration opponents, while
they conceded they expected the Nica
raguan convention would go through,
reiterated they would prevent ratifi
_ cation of the Colombian treaty to pay
an indemnity and express regret for
the partition of Panama.
In The Nicaraguan treaty proposes to
pay Nicaragua $3,000,000 for inter
ocean canal rights and naval bases
in the Bay of Fonseca. Protests
n against the naval base feature have
1 been made by Salvador, which con
t tends it would violate the sovereignty
of Honduras.
Assurances to Costa Rica, Salvador
and Honduras that none of their
y rights will be violated by the United
y States acquiring a naval base in the
Bay of Fonseca will be incorporated
s, in the ratification resolution on the
d Nicaraguan treaty which the Senate
is expected to pass.
