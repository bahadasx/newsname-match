The ([iij'ilivtmia! pi rim! fur
the sell''tion of our I \iro Iii; il
officials is fast approaching and
the citizens of Iberia are. as sov
ereigns. shortly to determine wit I»
the b«i 111 it their choice, among the
various as| it-ants to administer
the affairs of Iberia and to give
execution to the laws under
which we are governed. The se
lection of these officials signifies
more than tlit selection of indi
viduals. Yes, it signilies a par
ticipation in governmental hfl airs
and a determination of the char
acter of <r(>«iVrii ment Ibcrta Parish
will ha\e for a period of four
years, for the officials generally
reflect the government desired hy
„ , • ..pie. That this is true is ace. pt« d '•> - 11 political writers. A
eoiiinu nit\ or Parish where life and property are secure and
p»»Hce and order reign are always found officered hy competent,
liligent and fearless officials. A solemn duty therefore
rests with every patriotic ci t iwii to select, through the Fallot, that
! official or set of iriticials liest fitfed for the performance of the
duties of the office or the offices in question. It is more import
ant to the welfare of a Parish tlat proper meu he selected for
parochial oflicers than that such be selected for State or National
officers. The government at home—that whieliQ 'immediately af
fects the citizens in his cvervda,- affairs, insures protection to his
property and to his life and that of those hear and dear to him—
is paramount. We do not wish to minimize the importance of
having our State officials reflect a high type of citizenship, hit
we wish to stress the point that it behooves the citizen to have
the lirst regard for his local officials, with whom he comes in
frequent contact and to whom helooiks directly for protection in his
property and personal rights.
At this time we wish to coi.cern ourselves with two of the
most important parochial officials to be selected at the approaching
election, namely the Sheriff and the Clerk of Court.
Air. George Henderson aspire# to retain the position of Sheriff
and Mr. J. Gabi Le
lilauc, that of Clerk
of Court. \\\' em
phatically wish to
state that we be
lieve it to be to the
iijtdrest of Iberia
Parish itliat these
gentlemen he re
elected. Mr. Hen
derson has proven
himself a tower ol
strength in main
taining peace ana
order in this Parish
and his fearlessnesj
and earnestness in
policing the l'arisl
have repeatedly been
demonstrated. lie
has been efficient,
brave and competent
and this office is too important a one to entrust to untried hands.
And so with Mr. LeBlanc and his most efficient dejnity, Mr.
A. J. Maumus. The office of Clerk of Court vitally affects the
property rigts and titles of the people of the Parish and to be
secure in these—it is absolutely imperative that the Clerk of
Court and his chief deputy shonld be competent. Mr. LeBlanc
and Mr. Maumus have few equals in the State as efficient and trust
worthy and zealous officials, and a serious mistake it would be to
supplant them with others who have had no experience with the
'conduct of this particular office.
j Henderson and LeBlanc have been tried and have proven wor
thy and efficient and by this token, the citizenship of Iberia
should again be guided irrespective of party affiliation.

1 LANSING STUDIES THK BERLIN
' NOTE AT HOME
* Washington, Feb. 13.—Secre
tary Lansing studied at his home
tonight the text of the memoran
dum from Berlin announcing
the intention of the German gov
ernment to regard armed mer
chant ships of the entente allies
as warships after February 29.
He will discuss the subject with
President Oilson either tomorrow
or Tuesday. It is probable the
memorandum will be placed
before the cabinet meeting
Tuesday.
The memorandum from
Austria, similar to that issued by
Germany, had not arrived to
night, but was momentarily
expected.
It is considered doubtful that
an announcement of ths position
that the United States will take
in the matter will bs defined
until both documents havs been
considered.
Tt is now thought that there
has been such a revolution in po
litical sentiment in the third con
gressional district, that Parker
will not receive a majority of the
votes east in that district next
April.—Ex.
