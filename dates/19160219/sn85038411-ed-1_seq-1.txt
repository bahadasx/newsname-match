ing in St. Joseph s Hospital, i.ancas- j
ter, following an operation for inter- '
nal ailments.
Bishop Shanahan went under the
surgeon's knife on February 10 and
advices received by the clergy were j
that the operation was entirely sue- \
« essful and That a speedy recovery
was expected. So iittle was death an- I
tieipated that hospital authorities yes- ■
terday decided to allow the bishop to
sit u;> for a few hours to-day.
yesterday afternoon, however, his con
dition took a sudden change for the
worse and last evening internal hem
orrhages developed and all hope for
his recovery was given MJ>.
Ur. M. M. Hassett; " tor pf S;. Pat
rick's Cathedral, and vicar general of
the diocese, hastened to the bedside
of the dying bishop and he was with j
him when the end came.

Arrangements for the funeral of;
™ Bishop Shanahan were made this!

parlor where it will remain until l
taken into the Cathedral to lie in;
State. When this will be done has not
jet been announced.
Bishop Shanahan's home in this
city was at 2040 North Fifth street.
In HI Health a Year
Bishop Shanahan had been in ill
health for about a year and fully re
alized that his condition would mean
an operation but he ret used to spare
enough time from his duties tt> go to
« hospital until the last minute. Very
few of his friends or acquaintances
knew of his condition and it was not
until late yesterday afternoon that It
became generally known that he was
in the Lancaster hospital. His one
aijibition in life was to work for the 1
benefit of the Harrisburg diocese and
he cared but little about his own phys- i
ieal conditions
Of Unselfish Mind
Bishop Shanahan was a man of un
selfish mind and this trait was promi
nently displayed soon after he came
to Harrisburg when he gave up the
palatial home at Sylvan Heights,
which had previously been the resi
dence of Harrisburg bishops, for
orphan girls of the city p.nd
the diocese. He spent much of his
time at the orphanage looking after
the welfare of the children and when
lire gutted the big institution several
months ago he was noticeably affected.
