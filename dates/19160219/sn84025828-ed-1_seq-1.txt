Sullivan, Dunne, Sweitzer, Eckhart and
Burke Sure to Be Delegates at Large
Fight on Harrison.
The Battle for Delegates. Committeeships and Other
Big Plums Taking Up Attention of
Local Statesmen.
The April Primary
Election
Factions in Both the Big Parties Are Making a Hard Fight for
the Control of the Managing Committees.
Democrats are fighting to beat Har
rison for delegato because of the part
he and his friends played In defeat
ing Swoltzer for mayor last spring.
.The story which caused the biggest
laugh this week was the one that told
about Sullivan agreeing to make Har
rison a delegate and put him on the
Committee on Credentials. In other
words, Sullivan was to put Harrison
on tho committee that will have the
power to unseat Sullivan delegates.
The Sullivan men are all for Governor
Dunne, so that as far as harmony is
concerned, Sullivan, Dunne, Sweitzer,
Eckhart and Durke are elected now.
Harrison will bo fought to tho close
of the primary.
The most popular men on the Demo
cratic list for delegates' at largo will
be elected, regardless of faction. This
moans that the Democrats will
choose:
Roger C. Sullivan, who will be chair
man of the dologatlon,
t Governor Edward F. Dunno, who
will go on tho Commltteo on Resolutions-
to mnko tho party platform,
1 Robert M. Sweitzer, County Clerk,
ilofentod for mayor lust spring by the
Harrison men,
J Hobert 10. llurko, tho popular vet
eran Democrat,
J John W. Eckhart, prominent Demo
prntlc business man.
( These men aro almost certain of
flection. Tho majority of the slates of
till factions aro down stutcrs. Their
chances of election depend upon their
out of town strength.
Sullivan,
Dunno,
Sweitzer,
: Durko and
Eckhurt
Will carry

QUINN WILL HE MISSED
The Greatest Fighter on the Har
rison Side Has Retired from
the Battle Line.
James A. Qulnn, the greatest war
horse in the Harrison camp and a man
who has always delivered the goods
on primary day, will not be a candi
date for re-election ns Committeeman
In the Twonty-llrst ward.
This announcement filled the Har
rison lendors with dismay, ns Qulnn Is
tho hardest and best lighter they havo
had. He has been up against a hard
gumo whero he hns had to do all of
tho fighting; spending his own money
nil the time, with a ward full of states
men willing to taku nil the honors
without doing any of the work.
Qulnn will bo missed In tho dele
gate Imttlo this year and In tho other
lights too. Harrison has no warrior
on his staff who can hold n candlo to
him as an organizer or ns a winner.
