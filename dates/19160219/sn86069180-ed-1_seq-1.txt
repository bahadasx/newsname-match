Birthday of tho Father of Our
Country Occurs Next
Tuesday.
The One With Whom American
Indcpendnnco Had Its
Nativitj .
Ho Led Tills Great Nation to
Security, Prosperity and
Peace.
STOOD FOR RELIGIOUS PRINCIPLE
Next Tuesday the people of this
country wlfl celebrate the birthday
of one with whon American inde
pendence virtualy had its nativity,
for In him and through him came
tho prelude of tho paeans of victory
which later Cornwallls heard with
dismay. Oratory has given praiso to
tho "Father of his country" in
neither unstinted nor fulsomo terms.
Webs,ter magnificently declares:
"America has furnished to tho world
the character of Washington. And
if our American institutions had
done nothing elso that alono would
have entitled them to the respect of
mankind." History says of him
what Hamlet voiced of another:
"Remember thee!
Yea from the table of my memory
I'll wipe away all trivial fond rec
ords." Poetry glows with "all the wild
freshness of morning," when his
name is pronounced, and so Dyron
sings:
"While Washington's a watchword
such as ne'er
Shall sink, while there's an echo left
in air."
It is tho fashion to contrast Lin
coln and Washington. 'We believe,
however, that such a course of ac
tion wrongs both. Circumstances
differ In their lives and both molded
environment Instead of being shaped
by it. The men were different, for
their times differed, their triumphs
and uhconquorlng defeats differed,
their opportunities differed, their
cares differed, their duties differed
all differed, save their claims to our
unlimited devotion. Washington's
work" wouId"Tiave perished" had rrtft
Lincoln been born to maintain it, and
Lincoln would not have been great
had not his illustrious antecedent
given him a noble work to perpetu
ate. Both corresponded to their high
destinies. No palm has to be dis
puted, for there are immortal chap
lets for the two. Both "were giants
In their days tho one built a
mighty temple to liberty; tho other
held it from collapse and ruin.
To know tho value of Washington's
labors, wo would have to know the
length of all time, for to its end
their exlstenco will bo felt as force
ful and salutary powers. Washing
ton was father, counselor and af
fectionate friend to America. Aa a
father ho begot her greatness; as a
counsellor he mapped the certain
course of her perpetuity; as a friend
he showed unselfish consideration
that sought not its own ease nor
profit, but his country's llfo and
weal. Wonderful Is the knowledge
of conditions Washington displayed
in his farewell address. Had Amer
ica heeded his prophetic warnings
she would not have made some sorry
mistakes. Speaking of education:
"Whatever," said this wise seer,
"may be conceded to the influence
of refined education on minds of a
peculiar structure, reason and ex
perience both forbid us to expect
that national morality can prevail
in exclusion of religious principle."
What Lacordaire said in his pralsa
of O'Connell is true of Washington:
"Liberty is a work of virture, a holy
work, and consequently an intellec
tual work." As a consequence Wash
ington's life was pure, his labors
gracious, his Intellect clear in solu
tions of Cabinet and field questions.
With tho good common sense of
Marcus Aurellus, with the quiet
loftiness of the elder Brutus, with
the onergy of a Julius Caesar and
tho decision of a Napoleon, Washing
ton ascended his car of triumph
that will ever musically rumble
adown the sweeping avenue of Time.
From his station, higher than Em
perors', comes no forbidding cry of
"woo to the conquered!" He con
ducted no ruthless war of extermina
tion, for he wielded not a butcher's
axe, but a knlfo of sacrifice.' With
piety ho Invoked the God of battles,
and In humility ho fled from glory
to Mt. Vernon's gentle shades. Ho
led his nation to security, peace and
prosperity before he returned to its
scabbard his brave and heaven
favored sword.
VINOENTIANS.
One of tho Interesting features
of the recent inauguration of tho
Superior Council of the St. Vincent
do Paul Society at Washington was
the presentation of an exhibit of
tho organization, membership and
work of tho society in tho United
States. Tho labor entailed in the
preparation of these statistics called
for considerable aid and co-operation
on the part of the various di
visions of the society. The follow
ing statistics for the Province of
Cincinnati, comprising the States of
Kentucky, Ohio, Indiana, Tennessee
and Lower Michigan, will no doubt
prove of Interest here: Particular

BREAKERS THREATEN.
Wo have read tho call for tho
Iiish race convention in New York
next month, says Father Gannon in
the True Voice, and from its tenor
we can only conclude that the ex
tremists are promoting tho gather
ing. Wo expect that tho convention
will denounce Redmond and tho
Nationalist leaders In Ireland, de
clare again for tho absolute inde
pendence of Ireland ahd then ad
journ. We can not conceive what
good such a gathering can do at
this time, while it is easy to see
tho possibilities of creating further
and deeper divisions in tho ranks
of Irish sympathizers In America.
That will bo deplorable. Wo do. not
claim to have complete information
concerning conditions in Ireland at
the present time. Conflicting ac
counts reach us, and we allow for
exaggerations on both sides. But
we do not believe that any policy
settled upon in a convention in an
American city can be better than
that which Irishmen choose for
themselves. Wo believe they know
tho sltuaton better than we can pos
sibly advise them fiom this side of
the Atlantic. For that reason we
do hot bellovo that tho present is
an opportune time for a race con
vention in New Yoik or any other
city. We are satisfied that It can
do no good, and it may do much
harm. We nave ourselves been or
ten inclined to doubt the wisdom of
Redmond's policy since tho outbreak
of tho war. Wo do not rellBh tho
idea of Irishmen fighting England's
battles in Flanders, tho Balkans and
Gallipoll. But wo believe they are
doing as they think best, and wo
are willing to trust to' tho result to
justify their action. Wo are sure
that their cause will not bo helped
by the adoption of radical resolu
tions by their friends In this coun
try Homo rule for Ireland implies
that Irishmen at home and not in
America must decide what is best
for themselves. And wo aro willing
to grant them that measure of homo
rule. Others apparently believe
that every Irish question should be
settled for Ireland by convention in
America. We think that is a mis
taken view that may lead eventually
to great danger if not harm to
the cause of home rule.

SOCIALISTS
Their Dreams Fail to Material
ize When Time For Action
Gomes.
Champions of the Co-operative
Commonwealth Have Failed
to Co-operato.
Schenectady Is a Classical Kv-
ample or Division That
Follows Success.
PLANS DOOMED TO FAILURE
Success, complete success, is not
always the best that can bo desired
for mortal things. Theories and men
alike often miserably go to pieces
iWhenn momentary KronUof-ppwer
anu ravor comes their way. Tne
most beautiful dreams, built up in
time of unrcsponsiblllty, fall to
materialize when tho opportunity for
action comes. With tho Socialists
this grim fact has quite frequently
been demonstrated. There is io
dream of more persistency nnd vigor
in tho wholo Socialist Idyll than the
vision and thought of the "brother
hood of man," a dream based on a
true Idea, it must be said, but mis
understood and distorted by the
school of Marx. "Comrade" each one
calls tho other In their friendly and
official gatherings and meetings, and
fraternal love and fellowship beam
from eevry face until success comes
along and blasts It all.
Often of course tho comrades do
not even wait for success to Injure
this fine fiction, but straightway at
tho first misunderstanding they set
to peltrng each other with bitterest
attacks. In his book on "Drift and
Mastery" our young radical writer,
Walter Lippmann, who knows them
well, has pointed out this fact. But
with success there Is almost sure to
como division. And Schenectady,
Now York, Is a classical example of
that phenomenon.
When a few years ago George R.
Lunn, ox-preacher, wns chose'n as the
Mayor of that place on tho ticket
of the Socialists, trouble was pre
cipitated over the appointment of
certain officials by the Mayor who
were not members of tho party and
who were not endorsed by the So
cialist local for the place. Tho fight
which was thus begun went merrily
compromise declaration wns agreed
upon in regard to tho responsibility
of the elected official to his party
local. Nor was it halted then. For
scarcely has our honorablo Mayor
Lunn, running for a third time, been
again successful, which took placo
last year, than tho debate waxes
warm again.
Tho newly choson Mayor ap
pointed men to tho positions of Com
missioner of Charities and Superin
tendent of Water and Track In
spector who were objectionable to
tho Socialist local of Schenectady.
Two of them were not members of
tho party. Mayor Lunn declared
that theso appointments were made
in the interest of efficiency, ho not
being able to find any Schenectady
Socialist ablo to fill either of the two
first named places. How far this is
true can not bo known from long
range. Suffice It to say, that the lo
cal is not at all appeased, doclares
"efficiency" a false cry, and has fur
ther drawn the State Executlvo Com
mittee of tho party into the dispute.
And now, in the columns of the
New York Call, Executive Committee
and Lunn aro paying compliments to
each other. Tho Executive Commit
tee charges Lunn with having broken
faith, with Inconsistency and many
other uncoraradely things. The
Mayor in reply declares the commit
tee has loBt its temper, that it has
done him great harm by distributing
throughout tho country statements
that aro not true, that It wishes to
deny to a municipality real democ
racy And so no doubt it shall run
on for many a weary day,
This Is indeed a sorry sight. If
within the confines of a small com
munity the Socialists must turn on
the least provocation to warring
among themselves a very common
trait of radicals how can they at
all hope at any day to carry along
smoothly their promising co-opera-tlvo
commonwealth They have not
yet learned tho lesson of co-operation,
which begins In self-control.
nor will their philosophy ever teach
it to them. Their bright dreams are
doomed to failure; their plans will
I never come to pass; for these dreams
and plans have been bullded on an
j uncertain foundation. The "Broth-
jerhood of Man" can never bo real
ized through their propaganda.

PEACE OXM WITH HONOR.
Peace at any prico advocates were
criticized and national preparedness
was termed a religious as well as a
patriotic duty by Archbishop John
Ireland at the Cathedral at St. Paul
on Saturday in an eloquent funeral
oration over tho body of Col. Joslah
R. King, said by Minnesota historians
to bo tho first man to answer tho
call of President Lincoln for 75,000
volunteers In 1861 to put down the
civil war. After eulogizing Col.
King and Abraham Lincoln, and de
crying those wi say war Is never to
bo countenanced, the vencrablo Arch
bishop said:
"My prayer is that our country
may have social and commercial
peace, that we may havo the pros
perity to make us great in all things
good, and may havo a quick response
to patriotic duty. Wo hear much of
peace at any sacrifice. Peace with
honor, yes. Peace to tho glory of
our country, yes. But if it means
that we aro to be tho prey of inter
national ambition; if it means that
wo aro to do tho bidding of every
other nation on earth, and that our
flag must dip in disgrace, then we
must not havo peace. No nation can
bo weak today in preparedness and
strong tomorrow in efficiency."

CURIOUSLY LINKED TOGETHER.
The new Aichblshop of Chicago,
the Most Rev. George William
Mundeleln, is the second prelnte
whom New York lias sent to govern
tho gieat Western see, and both
theso pi elates aio linked together
by a cuilous incident. The first
Bishop was the Right Rev. William
Quarter, who was pastor of old St.
Mary's chuich in Grand street, New
York, when at the instance of Arch
bishop Hughes he was chosen for
tho new see of Chicago. It was by
Father Quaiter's permission that, in
Apiil, 1835, under the leadership of
the famous pioneer German pastor
of Now York, Brooklyn and Boston1
Father John Stephen Haffeiner, tuo
German Catholics of New York met
in the basement of St. Mary's
church on Second street. Archbishop
Mundeleln's natlvo parish. Tho
progress of the church in Chicago
Is thus related in this interesting
way with two parishes on tho East
Side of New York. Old St. Mary's
was ono of the strongest IrUh par
ishes in this' city, and St. Nicholas's,
tho first church for German Cath
olics, was equally representative of
the German colony. Both now
form tho heart of the great Jewish
section of tho East Sldo. When
Bishop Quaitcr reached Chicago, in
May, 1844, he found only two
priests and one church (St. Mary's)
In the straggling hamlet that had
grown up about Fort Dearborn. Now
there are 32G churches and a Cath
olic population of 1,250,000.
UNUSUAL INCIDENT.
A rather unusual incident took
placo recently In tho First Congre
gational chapel, in the city of
Flushing, N. Y when W. Bourke
Cochran spoko on "Why I Am a
Roman Catholic." This is tho third
of a scries in progress at that
church during the winter on "Pres
ent Day Creeds." It is believed
that this is unique in tho history of
Protestantism in this country. A
Roman Catholic layman speaking
under the auspices of a Protestant
church. In response to the Invitation
of its ministers, and speaking on
matters of tho Catholic faith. The
meeting was open to all. The
hymns used were thoso by Catholic
writers, and the service was such
as gave no offense to representatives
of any creed.

LEGISLATURE
Idling Valuable Time With tho
Hypocritical Prohibition
Measures.
Fanatical Preachers and Politi
cal Schemers Dictating
Votes of Dupes.
The Dry Representatives in Leg
islature Mediocre Set of
Law Makers.
HALT AND PALMER COMBINATION
The daily farce is still being
played at Frankfort, especially in
the lower houso of tho General As
sembly, where the much mooted
question of prohibition bobs up
dally In one form or another, serv
ing to block tho wheels of legisla
tion, which means much to the tax
payers who aro footing tho bills.
A day's visit during the present
session leaves one with the wish
that every voter in Kentucky could
at least witness ono day's proceed
ings of tho General Assembly and
a view of tho Capitol corridors and
Frankfort's hotel lobbies. If this
were possible tho voters would rlso
en masse and crush forever tho
hypocritical crowd who aro ' re
sponsible for tho present situation.
To begin with, you will observe tho
leaders of the dry movement in tho
gallery and about tho corridors
while in session, for tho most part
being composed of fanatical look
ing preachers who are reaping a
golden harvest with their antl
llquor campaign, knowing that
aside from their present vocation
they wouldn't bo ablo to command
more than a bare livelihood in some
obscuro country parsonage Tho
next noticeable feature ia their
dupps on tho floor, who havo been
elected from a district dry in namo
only, but where innumerable blind
tigers flourish. These men como to
the Legislature with but ono
thought uppermost In their mind,
and that is to vote dry on every
measure, their thoughts morning,
night and noon being on the liquor
question, and havo neither tho timo
or inclination to oven consider or
discuss measures of interest to tho
jjeoplepf JthjLjyholo stato.
in a visit to Frankfort tho other
day a Kentucky Irish American rep
resentative was struck with tho gen
eral weak appearanco of the dry
advocates In the lower house, whero
tho liquor question is being agitated
dally. Not satisfied with voting
against the liberal men, whom they
style as "wets," they have now be
gun to quarrel among themselves
as to whom is tho most rabid in
his advocacy of prohibition, tho
fight on tho floor last week being
between two of the dry men, tho
outcome of which has deadlocked
tho Legislature and is bringing in
resolutions dally from different
cliques of Baptist preachers back
ing ono or tho other. Hardly a day
passes without ono of the dupes on
the floor asking a question of per
sonal privilege to tell why he Is a
staunch advocate of piohibitlon, and
wants a special record of his voto
mado to show tho folks "back
hum." This same legislator in
most cases is not intelligent enough
to draft a bill and In all probability
was sent to tho Legislature In pref
erence to somo intelligent man, too
independent to bow to tho wishes
of tho fanatics who controlled tho
church and hypocrlto vote in his
district. Tho church voto in nine
tenths of tho cases is the Baptist
church vole, which dominates in
Kontucky, and according to tho
Baptist organ was going to namo
a Baptist Sunday-school Superin
tendent as the nominee for Gov
ernor on a dry platform. Scotch
the fanatical preachers who aro in
the pay of the Anti-Saloon Leaguo
and you will kill a political machine
which Is thriving on hypocrisy and
fanaticism.
' About tho lobby of the Capitol
Hotel tho same old scono Is re
enacted every day. You'll find Porcv
Haly buttonholing and hobknobbing
with tho dry legislators one minuto
hnd tho next they aro found in con
ference with Dr. Palmer, tho anti-
saloon leader, who halls from Michi
gan, but who can always bo found
mixeu up in Kentucky politics. Be
tween Haly and Palmer the dupes
are passed back and forth until
they become dependent on theso two
to even think for them. Palmer is
assisted by several slook looking in
dividuals who poso as representa
tives of children's societies, or
phan's homes, etc., but your first
impression is that you would hate
to trust your child or children in
their custody. This latter class
draw fat salaries as piotectors (?)
