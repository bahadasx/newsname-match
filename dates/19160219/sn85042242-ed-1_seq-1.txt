FLAT REFUSAL TO
COMPROMISE EXPECTED
Principles Laid Down in the Lusi
tania Case Will Not
Apply.
Washington, Feb. 18.—-Germany's
response to the latest request of the
United .States for assurances that sub­
marine warfare will be conducted in
accordance with established princi­
ples of international law is expected
here to be a flat statement that as­
surances previously given in the Lusi
tania and Arabic cases had to do only
with unarmed vessels, and that the
German government must' feel cer
tain that its submarines, which warn
a merchant ship, will not be attack­
ed. Furthermore, the Berlin foreign
office probably will ask the United
States for its definition of defensive
armament.
'Reply Indicated.
Indications, of what the German re
ply may be are understood to have
been given in informal conversation
between state department officials
and Teutonic diplomats since they an­
nounced their intention of sinking all
armed merchantmen after February
2D.
The United States today made its
first formal declaration that it does
riot accept as legal tlie announced:
intehtion of the Teutonic powers,
when the state department sent to
the consular representatives abroad,
for their information, notification that
this government considers that mer­
chant ships have a right to carry de
fensive armament. The dispatches
contained excerpte frou) newspaper
articles s'ettirtg" ifdHh tlie position
of the United Slates.

•In this connection it became known
the. the Swedish government bad in­
structed its consular officers to ad­
vise all' (Swedish subjects preparing
to' embark* on vessels of the Entente
allies of the warning given by Ger­
many and Austria.
It. is considered certain that the
question Of defining the defensive
armament will be the basis of lengthy
negotiations with the Central powers,
beginning when the reply is received
to the message outlining the views
of the United States, which Count
von Bernstorff, the German ambas­
sador, has sent his government. In
this message, the ambassador trans­
mitted at some length the views ex­
plained to him by Secretary Lansing.
The response is not expected before
the last of next week.
It was admitted at the state depart­
ment today that the question of writ­
ing a formal note on the subject of
the conduct of subamrine warfare af­
ter the complete German declaration
and its appendix had been received,
was under consideration. It is cer­
tain that Austria also will be supplied
with the views of the United States,
although so far as can be ascertained,
no steps in this direction have as yet
been taken.

Washington,' Feb.' 18,—Germany's

Oklahoma City, Feb. 18.—Tumultu­

house of representatives
late
today
while the members were voting on a
section of an election law designed to
take, the place of the famous "Grand­
father Law" which was recently de­
clared unconstitutional by the United
States supreme court because, in ef­
fect, it disenfranchised the negro pop­
ulation of the sta,tjjfe."
•Partisan feejUng" over the new meas­
ure finally culminated in an outbreak,
precipitated by charges of corruption
and the passing of the lie between
members, during which ink bottles,
paper weights and tjther fixtures of
the members' deskS' were used as
weapons, and a set battle seemed in­
evitable as Democrats massed and ad­
vanced toward the Republicans and
Socialists.
Knocks Down Representative.
Arthur H. Geissler, chairman of the
Republican state central committee,
was knocked down and rendered un­
conscious by Representative Loris E.
Bryant.
The proposed law is I lie product of
a Democratic caucus. It had passed
the senate and was up for final pas­
sage in the house late today with Re­
publican and Socialist members otter­
ing vigorous opposition.

the courtesy of a visitor's permit.

Representative Sams, Republican,

he was raised in a section where the
Republicans had overridden him with
corrupt practices and he had no de­
sire to be fair with Republicans.
"They probably

"If you make that charge, you are

Sams arose in his seat and in an
attitude of defiance shouted toward

"Come on."
In an instant, every Democratic

was oh his feet. Then the ink bottle

Robinson of Arkansas Asks for

Service.
WORK HANDLED IN
VERY "ROTTEN WAY"
Letters Between Army Officers
Are Offered in Substan­
tiation.
Washington, Feb. 18.—Sensational
charges against the army aviation
service with a demanu for immediate
investigation by congress, were made
today before the senate military com­
mittee by Senator Robinson of Arkan­
sas. He declared that the service
was' "contemptibly inefficient" and
that its head lieutenant, Colonel Sam­
uel Reber,!not only was making no ef­
fort to improve it, but deliberately
was preventing the facts from reach­
ing his superior.
Has Mass of Data.
The senator appeared before the
committee with a mass of data, in­
cluding photographic copies of let­
ters which he said had been exchang­
ed between Col. Reber and Captain
Arthur S. Cowan, commanding the
aviation station at San Diego. (At
least, part of this evidence was pro­
duced before the court martial at San
Francisco, which recently tried Lieut.
Col. Lewis E. Goodyear, judge advo­
cate general of the Western depart­
ment, accused of improperly altering
certain charges filed by other officers
against Captain Cowan.
Findings of Commission.
The findings of this court now are
in the hands of a special commission
of army officers, appointed by the act­
ing secretary of war to make a report
to President Wilson.
Senator Robinson read liberal ex­
cerpts from his photograph of letters
Wnfl (Jtidted Capmin CoSvan as "wrltiftg
to Col. Reber that if the service ever
came under investigation by any one
outside the signal corps, it would be
impossible to explain the "rotten way
in which the work has been handled."
Other letters were produced to show
that favoritism was practiced in the
promotion of men in the service.
Practiced Deceit.
The senator charges that Col. Re­
ber promoted Captain Cowan to prac­
tice "contemptible deceit" toward
congressmen who visited the aviation
station and that he attempted to get
into the annual appropriation bill in
connection with the items for the pur­
chase of airships a provision for the
purchase of "accessories" with which
to buy automobiles. He said the col­
onel wrote that the word "accessor­
ies" would be like "charity and cover
a multitude of sins."

The plant, which has developed
since the outbreak of the European

been heavily guarded day and night.
The cause of the explosion has not

There has been considerable artil­

The capture of Kavaya, Albania, 80

of Albania, by Austro-Hungarian
troops, assisted by Albanians, is an­
nounced in the official report of the

ceived here today, which says the

The ministry of Aristide Briand

who, after long preparation, sought
to overthrow the government on the
question whether it was not delegat­
ing too much authority to the gener­
al staff. The proposed attack on the
ministry had been common talk in
parliamentary quarters for a month
past. It was based more on political
rivalries than on real differences over
the/ conduct of the war. IMr. Briand
met his opponents by declining reso­
lutely to have their questions discuss­

vote of confidence in the movement.
This was given, 394 to 169.

Matter Will Be Discussed by B*
gents Today and Formal

President J. H. Worst of the State
Agricultural college at Fargo appeal*
ed before the state board of regents
yesterday, in the interests of the Ag­
ricultural college. Stories printed in
a Fargo paper to the effect that Pres­
ident Worst would deliver an ulti­
matum to the board were errppeous.
The looked-for fireworks did not ma­
terialize, and President Worst gave
the board some valuable information
in regard to the state farm-school.
The Agricultural eollege is practi­
cally under two heads at the present
time, with all- the resultant confu­
sion and ill-feeling which follow1
such conditions. Before the state
board of regents came into bteing the
old board of trustees of the college
put Thomas A. Cooper in charge of
the college extension work, and also
the experiment station. His authority
has been co-ordinate with that of the
president since the change was made,
mid more or lose frMon has resulted*
The board has not as yet announced
what policy will be followed at the
college, and will likely not do so un­
til the report of the educational sur­
vey is completed by Dr. E. B. Craig­
head.
1
Board Not 'Responsible.
The board of regents"had absolute­
ly nothing to do with bringing about
the present condition at the Agricul­
tural college. They took charge of
all state educational institution!# last
July, and have made few changes as
yet in any of the institutions. The
board has gone about the work in a
systematic manner and were more
than glad to have conditions at the
Aggie college clearly explained 'by
President /Worst.
Favor One Head.
While the board did not take any
official action in the matter yesterday,
the individual members were unan­
imously in favor of one head for the
Agricultural college. However, the
matter will be thoroughly discussed
today, and some plan arrived at.
The following plan was suggested
by President Worst:
To the State 'Board of Regens.
Gentlemen: I beg to submit the
following for your consideration and
adoption as a remedy for existing ad­
ministrative difficulties under which
the Agricultural College management
has labored for the past two years,
and which, in my opinion, has not
only greatly impaired the efficiency of
the college, but the present adminis­
trative organization is unquestionably
in violation of both federal and state
law.
The state board of regents, with a
view to providing for a closer and
more perfect co-ordination of all de­
partments and divisions of the North
Dakota Agricultural college, hereby
revokes all previous acts of its board
of trustees to the contrary, and es­
tablishes in general terms the follow*
ing memoranda of organisation, to»
wit':
1. For administrative purposes the
college shall be divided into three
main divisions, viz: (1) Teaching
(2) Experimentation (3) Extension
Work. Each of these divisions shell
be provided with an administrative
officer with the direct management of
its affairs.
2. The college shall have one chief
executive head, the president, and
the directors of the teaching, experi­
ment station, and extension depart­
ments or divisions shall be subordi­
nate to the president and under his
general direction as provided for by
Section 1109 of the Political Code, as
follows:
"The president shall be the chief
executive officer of the college, and
it shall be his duty to see that all
rules and regulations, are executed,
and the subordinate officers and em­
ployes, not members of the college
faculty, shall be under his direction
and supervision."
Provided, however, that for tbe
present and until funds are available,
the president may act as director of
the teaching work of the college, and
that these directors and the president
shall constitute an •administrative
board, empowered to determine
the
lines of work, the division of the
work
under the three divisions
or braaci—
named, an£ the selection of
competent
assistants and employes and

signment of work, and
