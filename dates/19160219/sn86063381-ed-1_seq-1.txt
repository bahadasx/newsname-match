Convention is Closed.
The convention was closed last
evening with a reception at the high
school.
At the final general session last
evening H. W. Shyrock, president of
the Southern Illinois Normal univer
sity of Carbondale, 111., delivered an
excellent address on the topic, "The
Obligation the Individual Owes to
Society."
Most Lawless People.
"I wonder if you realize that we
are the most lawless civilized people
in the world," said Prof. Shyrock in
his address. "I know that you know
it if you have read or traveled. We
are the most lawless civilized people
in the world. I say that deliberately
as I know whereof I speak, and I am
not even considering the terrible
lynch law which is in a class by it
self. Half the ordinances in every
city are dead letters."
Schools Open to All.
He opened his address in a light
numerous vein and after announcing
that his patriotism was as loyal as
that of anyone present, ended in a
thunder of condemnation of present
conditions. His opening remarks
dealt largely with economic condi
tions which are of much estimable ad
vantage to the modern men and wo
men. He graphically cited examples
of how a man could purchase a hat
for a nominal price today, while if
he had situated like Robinson Cru
soe and compelled to do all the labor
himself from the first idea down to
the finished product it would take
him about 72 years and then it would
not be much of a hat. He stated
that the economic conditions of the
present time were oftentimes over
looked by reason of their very obvi
ousness He called attention to the
fact that the public schools were open
to all and that the states educate and
protect the children so that they in
turn could do something for the
world society.
Classified Into Three Roots.
"The entire human family can be
classified into three great roots," he
said. "The first, those who are in
capable of making any return of
value, such as the aged, the very
young and the defective second,
those who are capable but unwilling
third, for those who are willing and
capable
"America, for aged people, in gen
eral, has done nothing to secure to
old age its rights. The aged should
not be expected to make any return
to society an din time every civilized
land will have an old age pension
law In England recently $66,000,-
000 was expended in one year in old
age pensions, for service rendered,
for honorable records.
Should Remain in School.
"We haven't done anything for our
children Up to the age of 21 they
should be in school, or studying to
prepare themselves for what they are
to do later When they are taken
from school at a tender age, the state

Of this kind are defaulting bank

there is the deadly parasite group
such as gamblers, thieves, etc.

"The third class, those who are
capable and willing, may also be

only one out of forty are really effi

let us increase the efficient ones and
make them effective in their work.
Teachers should lay stress on econ
omic honesty and teach honesty even
in dealing with corporations. Teach
respect for the law. In Europe the
law is enforced, but in America it is

Ready to Cheat.
"Americans are ready by lies and
tricks to cheat corporations and even
the state. We are only a little ways
from pioneer days. Our fathers
came here in the spirit of rebellion.
They put one kind of lawlessness
against another, and two wrongs
never yet made a right. That's the
American spirit.
Personal Liberty.
"It has come to pass that crimes
are excused on the ground of 'per
sonal liberty.' These have cc-me to
be splendid words. Across interven
ing time comes tire voice of Madame
Roland, doomed to die upon a FRM&ch
scaffold She said: "*0, LTberty,*hcv
many crimes have been committed in
thy name.'
Prof. Shyrock closed his address
with the plea:
"God, give us law in liberty,
And liberty in law."

Washington Makes the First Formal
Declaration Regarding Foreign
Affairs.
Washington, Feb. 19.Germany's
response to the latest request of the
United States for assurances that sub
marine warfare will be conducted in
accordance with established princi
ples of international law is expected
here to be a flat statement that as
surances previously given in the Lu
sitania and Arabic cases have to do
only with unarmed vessels and that
the German government must feel
certain that its submarines which
warn a merchant ship will not be at
tacked. Furthermore the Berlin for
eign office probably will ask the Unit
ed States for its definition of defen
sive armament.
Gleaned From Conversation.
Indications of what the German re
ply may be are understood to have
been given in informal conversations
between state department officials
and Teutonic diplomats since Ger
many and Austria announced their
intention of sinking all armed enemy
merchantmen after Feb. 29.
The United States today made its
first formal declaration that it does
not accept as legal the announced in
tention of the Teutonic powers when
the state department sent to diplo
matic and consular representatives
abroad for their information, notifi
cation that this government considers
that merchant ships have a right to
carry defensive armament. The dis
patches contain excerpts from news
paper articles setting forth the posi
tion of the^ United States.
Swedes Are Warned.
In this connection it became known
that the Swedish government had in
structed its consular officers to ad
vise all Swedish subjects preparing to
embark on vessels of the entente al
lies, of the warning given by Ger
many and Austria.
It is considered certain that the
question of defining defensive arma
ment will be the basis of lengthy ne
gotiations with the central powers,
beginning when the reply is received
to the message outlining the views of
the United States, which Count von
Bernstorff, the German ambassador,
has sent his government. In this dis
patch the ambassador transmitted at
some length the views explained to
him by Secretary Lansing. The re
sponse is not expected before the last
of next week.
