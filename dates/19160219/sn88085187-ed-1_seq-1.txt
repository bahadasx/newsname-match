It Is undeniable that the .-rtory
has broad and strong founda
tions. There is a great body of
-Water there, with land under it.
There is a park; there rs a
smelter: the smelter inal.es -ilan;
whicli makes fine foundations for
dry docks; there is a. congress
of the U. S.; there is a staid
government; there is a l\ S. en
gineer; there is a Seattle; thoro
Is a park board; there is room,
and need, for a dry dock In Ta
coma; there are several other
true statements of a similar
character; and there is an active
brain which built up the story.
There is no disputing facts
like these, and from a certain
standpoint, the "story" is "good
reading."
But the standpoint is that of
the novelist who turns out "beet
sellers."
Newspapers are supposed to
concern themselves with matters
of a different character—except
on Sundays.
But the labor devoted to con
structing the story need not be
considered wholly lost.
With tke aid of his trusty pen
cil, the author can, in a few ,nln
utes, by a little substitution in
names, etc., make an excellent
flour mill story out of It.
If he had gone a step further,
and clearly Indicated, by street
and number, where stock in the
dry dock company could be pur
chased, he could bo convicted,
under any "blue sky" statute.

LOOT SECOND STORY MAN RETURNED
The remarkable letter received yesterday by Miss Cynthia Grey, of The Times staff,
from a burglar, and the jewelry that was enclosed. As was stated in ihis paper yesterday,
the jewelry was Btolen from the home of William ililthmnn, 2101 North Fife street, pro
prietor of the Crescent Realty Co. The letter, spelled out ln capital letters, read as follows:
"DEAR CYNTHIA GREY: "ITS LAUGHABLE ENOUGH TO MAKE GOD LAUGH.
THE LIES SOME PEOPLE TELL. BOTH THB LEDGER AND THE NEWS COME OUT
WITH A STORY OF A $200 ROBBERY. I SEND TOO THE JUNK ENCLOSED FOR RE
TURN TO OWNER. IT'S WORTH ABOUT SIX BITS TO ME. HOPE YOU WILL FEAST
ON THE BRILLIANCY OF THE BRILLIANTS AND THE RICH COLOI. OF THE GEMS.
B. S. T."
What Cynthia Grey
Advises the Burglar
BY CYNTHIA GREY ,
Mr. B. S. T., Burglar:—When you deposited tfiat^junk" in the en
velope and mailed it to me, did not the feeling etp over you i'<»r an in
stant that perhaps all property stolen from yqu* brother citizens is
"jnuk" so far as bringing the thief happiness is concerned.
''It's worth about six bits to me," yon say. Didn't it nr to yon
that it might include keepsakes that are priceless to .-some human heart,
though perhaps nearly worthless in the eyes of the men to whom you mar
ket your harvest I
I feel highly complimented that you selected me as the medium to re
turn the stolen gems to their owner. 1 have done my part, and now 1 want
to make a request of yon.
The next time you enter someone's house, if ever you do it again, and
steal gems that are of real value in gold, will you retifni tliein to me, just
as yon returned this "junk"/
Your letter shows you to be a clever, well educated burglar, with a
sense of humor that would preserve the manliness of a worse offender
against society than you appear to be. You spell correctly and write pun
gently. * .
Are you "up against it"? Are you, or some member of your family
going hungry? . .
Do you get any happiness or contentment frail tl|c possession of stol
en gems! . $ i
If not, write to me again. I'll be proud to halt' your confidence.
There ought to be some way by which you can hit the road to true con
tentment and keep your body alive at that.
Believe me when I say that it is not what a perso^ takes from society
that, makes him happy, but what he gives. >
I hope to hear from you.
