What Your League Has Done
In Minnesota, the Governor of the State has appointed a
Knight of Columbua Assistant Attorney General for the sole
purpose of prosecuting patriotic speakers and putriotic paper.
Thia League haa been aiding in a financial way our brother
who are being prosecuted in Out State, and so far we are pleased
to report that the Roman Catholic prosecution have been tin-
UCCCMfuL
All are familiar with the fact that the Honorable Thomas
E. W'ataon of Georgia ha aim been chosen as'a victim of the
rago of the pope's emimariea. Mr. Watson, prior to his en
gaging seven years ago in our patriotic fight, was a lawyer of
large and extensive practice. lie mado money rapidly, and
acquired valuable properties not only in his home state, but in
the states of Virginia and Florida. When he went out of the
law practice and took up literary work ho soon found that the
greatest danger which confronted our American Republic was
' the attempt which was being made by the Roman Catholic
church to dominate and rule America. Being an honest nun,
and being absolutely fearless in the expression of his convic
tions, he began, through his publications The Jeffersonian and
Watson'e Magazine to call the attention of Uie patriotic people
to this danger.
No man yet has been bora that eaa make better in of the English
language ia expressing hia view, than Mr. Watsoa. lie spok only the
plain truth about tha practice which he found to exist among the
priest aad prelate, but thia waa sufficient to bring dowa npoa hit
dead tha wrath of political Roma. A bo Trot t waa instituted against
biro, and aa a remit thereof, ha waa compelled to sacrifice hia property J
la Virginia aod Florida and put the money received from the eal of
these properties into hia publication,
Borne knew well that with her great power aha eould drive out of
buaineaa any oae maa who opposed her, for, aha had don the same
thing la thousand of inataaee ia th peat. ,
Mr. Wataoa 'a frienda ia Georgia rallied to his support, but with
that aaaiataae his pubtieaiioaa for thro years laat paat brought him no
revenue.
This League was organized for the purpose of helping to
protect the patriots, who are speaking and writing in defense
of our liberties. So when Mr. Watson's trial came on at
Augusta, Georgia, we sent there Mr. J. I. Shenpnrd, our attor
ney, and instructed him to confer with Mr. Vaton, and tell
him that the Free Presa Defense League was ready, willing, and
able to bear the financial burden placed upon him by the prose
- rations brought against him in tho Federal Court at the in
stigation of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy.
It waa explained to Mr. Wataoa that those who are members of thia
league, and who contributed to ita support, are his frienda, and that th
aa of th league 'a funda ia paying'the expenae of his proeeeutioa
ronld ia ao win be eoniidered other tha that which waa du to him,
THE CHEAT DEFENDER OP THE PEOPLE'S BIGI1TS.
Mr. Wataoa nnheaitatinfiy accepted our proffered aaNurtaace, and
. we paid the expenae he waa compelled to undergo ia defending himaWf
f agwinat peraeeutioal Bo it la that we are able to aay to tha cnemiea of
. thia republic, who are trying to deetroy Tom Wataon and hia influence,
that the patriotic people of America ar standing back of him loyally,
and that they cannot bankrupt him or put him out of buaineaa, ao long
aa aay patriot haa a dollar left.
. The League has financed The Mexact cane, the Watson
case, several cases in Minnesota and one in New Mexico. It has
assisted in the prosecution of the murderers of Rev. William
. Black.
Tt will be remembered that there waa 128,500 contributed to ear
fund, a report of which haa heretofore beta published ia Tus Mixicx.
Of this sum we bow hare ia oar treeary alittl lea thaa 110,000. W are
sending a letter to each member of Tha Free Prea Defena Leafoe
which give ia detail th amnaata of money expended by the leag aad
the purpo for which they were expended.
We ar convinced that oae it is know that this orvanltatioa

that th papiau bar who desire to avppreaa frte prea. fne tprttk end

ever there is a prosecution brought against on of our people, who is ia

It was a splendid triumph, won after
one of the most stubborn legal battles
that has been fought in rent years.
AND IT WAS YOUR VICTORY.
ONLY VOI R PROMPT AND GEN
ERAL RESPONSE TO OCR CALL
FOR Fl'XDS MADE POSSIBLE THE
TIIOROCGH PREPARATION AND
SUCCESSFUL OUTCOME OF THIS
FAMOUS CASE. For though the ser
vices of Mr. J. I. Shepherd, the senior
eouoM'l and secretary-treasurer of the
Lesgue, were freely given without com
pensation though he gsve to the case
the benefits of the long and exhaustive
tudv of a brilliant and experienced legal
mind inspired by a pavion for the pres
rrvstion of our free inntilutions, the
other expenses were neceanarily grest; for
realizing the vital importance of the case,
the League determined to provide for
every contingency.
It came into court prepared to prove, (1) THAT THE
ARTICLES AXD BOOK COMPLAIXED OF. WERE XOT
OBSCEXE, BUT WERE STERXLT MORAL and contained
revelations and facts that the high endt of sound morality de
manded should le upotfd; (2) that the charges rrre true and
that the dtftnte Vas prtpartd to estabJuh the truth thereof;
(3) that not only wrre the editors end publishers Christian men,
enjoying the love and rrspecl of the community in rhirk they
tired, but that their publication and Mr. Crovley'i book rert
moral in character, truthful in the charges made and that de
manded by the highest interests of morality, just as the fearless
exposure of corrupt conditions is alrays necessary in order to
compel corrections of the evils. For the purpose of substantiat
ing all these claims the defense had been at great pains and
expense to provide proof from an army of witnesses.
The prosecution, however, insisted that the truth or falsity
of the charges, the character of the defendants and of the pub
lications complained of, and even the character of the articles
mentioned in the indictment MUST NOT BE CON
SIDERED. Its position wss that the few vords, ten'
tences, and paragraphs urenched from their context must
be msde THE SOLE CONSIDERATION OF THE JURY.
The judge, though adding a little matter from the context to
the fragments that were mane the bssis of the indictment,
on. the u hole sustained the position of the government.
Wo heartily wih you could have been present at this trisl
for it would have shown you in a startling way, how tho sinister
hand of the papal machine is striving to strike down those who
are serioutly obstructing the onward march of the hierarchy
in American political life.
Political Romanism Real Prosecutor
Th proaneutloa had blunderingly striven to make th people bell era
that Borne traf not t instigeting emus of tke trial, and then called
to th ataad leofi off viol of the Kniohts of Columbut of tliouri,
end a promiaeal ofetr of the American federation ofVothoUe 8ocetiet
to prove that they had received Tai hfsiucs containing th matter
complained of through th mail, and had furnished the same for the
use of the prosecution. One of Me men admitted that hod author
ircd th jmMtciaftA for general distribution of pomp Wet containing
the letter which Foul Bakrvtll, m promises! A'siM of Columbus, had
written to the Weshington muthoritiee demanding anion against Tns
Mr.XACX. Another witness, a prominent and awtfi official of the
Jmerican federation of l'(olio Boeirties, admitted that he had
conferred with Tan! Bakewell and O'N'eil Ityaa, another prominent
Komanist, oa Tub Mikacb matter, aad had furnished copios of th
paper to Paul BakewelL A third witness for th prosecution, was th
secretary or atenographer of Paal BakewelL rh stated ah waa a
Homan Catholic, and according to her testimony ah had, under the
direction of Mr. Bakewclt, aent for, received, and marked for identifica
tion th two copies of Mr. Crowley's book upon which on count of,
the indictment waa baaed.
Every witness for the Government who was uvd to es
tablish that The Mexack and book complained of hnd been
received through the mails, were prominent Roman Catholics.
THE IIAXDY MEX OF THE HIERARCHY WERE
THERE. BESIDES OFFICIALS OF THE KXIGHTS OF
COLUMBUS AtiD THE AMERICAX FEDERATIOX OF
CATHOLIC SOCIETIES, THERE WERE NUMBERS OF
rROMIXEXT R0MAXISTS OX EVERY HAXD AT THE
TRIAL. Paul Bale veil vas present, a prominent figure in a
group of active Knights of Columbus. It was evident that the
papal machine realized the importance of crushing TnE MOST
INFLUENTIAL AND FAR REACHING WARNING
VOICE IN THE LAND, and it counted on the narrow con
struction, insisted upon by the prosecution, enabling it to win.
The thorough preparation aad masterly management of the defense
which fought over very lack of ground ia th Interest of morality,
justice, and freedom, however, waa followed by tha vosnimoua verdict
of acquittal. Th cohort of the hierarchy wer stunned at their dafoaa.
The moral effect of the work of yonr League along this
line on public opinion has been only second to the direct ser
vices rendered. While it has inspired with sew enthusiasm
and courage our loyal patriotic Americans who were beginning
to lose heart, since there was no able organized force out in the
open fighting intelligently, wisely and aggressively a well
financed, perfectly organized and militant Roman Hierarchy.
But the result of The Menace trial, while a splendid vic
tory, Has aroused in icome a new determination to tight as
never before to rain a rtrande hold on the oatriotic movement
before the EIGHTY MILLION NON-ROMAN CATHOLICS
of America can be aroused to a realization of what political
Itomanisra is doing in this land. .
Two Vicious Bills Before Congress
Already two vicious bills to increase the bureaucratic au
thority of the postmaster-general have been introduced into
the present. Congress, similar in character to the dance ro us
bills that two leading Roman Catholics tried to have passed at
last years session oi Congress.
The purpose of these bills ia to increase the autocratic
power already poSsesjed by the Postirs-rter-eeneral the desire
of the Romanists behind these measures is to make an4 appointive
executive officer a bureaucrat possessing powera very similar to
tho which hive vnade the bureaucratic
of Russia a cruel, blighting curse to the
empire of the ciar. Powers now poaaeae
ana rightly red by the eourte, would
be exercised bv this autocrat. WITH
SUCH A LAW THE POLITICAL RO
MANISTS COULD EASILY USE THE
ROMAN CATHOLIC VOTE AS A
BAIT TO SECURE THE SELECTION'
OF A POSTMASTER-GENERAL SUB
SERVIENT TO THE HIERARCHY.
And clothed with the power thee bill
would give he could ana would interfere
with freedom of religious diwmiion.

The Question We Must Face
SHALL THE REPUBLIC BECOME A PAPAL STATE

HEROES, AND WHICH GAVE TO THE WORLD A NEW
SYSTEM OF RULE THE MAGNA CHARTA OF MOD
ERN DEMOCRACY, whose distinguihhing glories were popu

divorce of church and state, and the most magnificent system
of free education known to civilization?

cscspablc question is, ARE WE BIG ENOUGH TO RISE TO
THE SOLEMN DEMANDS OF THE HOUR? ARE WE
READY TO PROMPTLY ANSWER THE CALL OF DUTY,
"HERE AM I, SEND ME OR "THOUGH 1 CANNOT

IF YOU ARE READY TO DO TniS TnE REPUBLIC
CAN AND WILL BE SAVED. THE HOUR HAS STRUCK
FOR ACTION, WHAT IS YOUR ANSWER?
What Must Be Done
The demand is greater, th field ia broader, and the necessity more
imperative thaa ever before. In addition to protecting our press and

) This is a great work, it demands consecrated sert ire, hard labor
end sufficient funds to male it eomplettlu successful. It can be done
end with uour aid we stand ready to carry it forward. We have a
eomprehenstre plan that will mean I ICTUKY.
Just here let us tell you what we have recently done out
side of the line of merely defending our press and patriots whom
Rome, using our government as her CAT'S PAW, was striving
to strike down.
.We felt that we must have authoritative news from our
nation's capital, as to the schemes and the doings of the
ivman Hierarchy.
vatchlng Rome at Nation's Capital
, The Pope of Rome sends an Italian gentleman aa a dele
gate to the capital of our country Washington City to rep
resent him in American anairs. e thought it no more than
rifht that an American gentleman should go to Washington to
represent you and the other patriots of this country, and to
lok after your interests and the interests of all other patriots
in governmental affairs. We thought that if Cardinal Gibbons,
and other great dignitaries, leva the right to call upon the
president and heads of departments and secretaries and men
oert of congress tn ine interests oj mtngs un-.mencan, yowi
should' hare a representative in Washington to call vpon these'
tame people. in the interest of things American.
; TT thought that aine th newspaper ar coastaatly Ailed with th !
doing of th Bomaa Catholic ehnn-fc aad its officials, you also should be
represented ia th newspaper, and that you and your frieaila ahould be ;
kct informed aa t what th patriot ar doing, and also what the,
intriguing conspirator ar doing. Ho the Pre PTeaa Defense League !
he aent to Washington its vice-president, Gilbert O. Nation, to act aa
yjr representative ia thee an alters. This reprsaentative yon is a
V-foX patriot, a was of marked ability and intelligence, and one that
xill rank as the peer of any man in Washington. lie is an honest, fear. ,
Vl and untiling worker. Xour affairs will be woQ token cava by him.
lie arrived to Waahingtoa December 6th, at th opening of
Congress, and will remain ia that city permanently. As fast he
receive information that he considers" of importance to th patriota,
he will and this ia th form of a letter to Taa Mbracb. end to all ;
ethtr of ta patriotic paper aad saagaxiae. The letters will probably j
appear eaeh week, bat ii not each week, they will appear whea ther U .
necessity lor taem.
We are attempting something that has never been. done
before, and we know that yon will indorse thia action. Here is
a man representing the patriotic people, and all of them. IT
owe no tJ. ligation except to bis God and his country. Now
friends pay atnet attenfina) to our request When yow see
new letter in your patriotic sprr from Mr. Nations, who will
sign him aelf a Vire-Preai dent of The Free Trese IVfen)
League, be sure to clip thia article from the paper yon find it
in, and tale it to your hxwl paper and init upon its publica
tion. In mMt inUDxe your local editor will be glad to give
the people the news, for it will be the news that everyone will
want to know. If the Wal editor refuses to publish the same
upon yonr reqticM, ph aae 1 t us kuow his name, the name of his
paper and bis rcseati for Musing to gite the truth to the
people.
Ia the way that w hat eathned a vas. amiwrat of publicity eaa
be gtvea to U patriotic cause and w will a doubt get th very beat
results.
If a preei.teat, a president 'a secretary, a head ef a depart meat, a
see I or, a rotigreanaa r any ulher of our gwverameat eltirtaia la has ia
his dnt'ca a pattM'tir AmerHan, yna may be sure that Mr. Natmoa
will discover It, and will giv the people am thereof la th maaner
hereia in. Urn ted.
Thi is only the beginning f our publicity campaign. Wa
will have agent and representative in each state capital, and
if there are men elected to ofti who think they can hood-wink
the people and violate their oath of office bv becoming sub
servient to Rome, these gentlemen will find themselves exponc4
asa a. .
ana neia up to public contempt and scorn.
Now Is the Time for Action
The hour for action is here. What ha been done is small
indeed to whit will be accomplished, if we are wise enongh and
great enough to seize the erpportunity now presented.
A GENERAL ELECTION IS PENDING. E0ME IS

THE POWER TO MAKE THE NEXT EIGHT MONTHS

EMANCIPATION.
With supreme confidence ire atrait four answer.
The bitterest enemies of The Free Press Defense League
will be compelled to admit that the League has made good. It
friends are overjoyed at the work we have accompliohed. We
have the undoubted confidence of the patriotic people. They
know that our work in the future will measure up to what we
have done in the pent.
We must not forget, however, that we ar lighting th greatest
political machine the m rid haa ever hnown. VT are fighting a maebiu
that stops and balks at no means that will accomplish its purpose. The
boycott, the luing tongue of slander, the bhtdaeon, the patsun cup, the
dagger, the pistol und the bomb, are all fnmihar reenoa to-pnnal Jtosv,
aad tcy hare all been used tn the past by this power, and if accessary
they wUl be used again and atatn. This organisation is controlled by
unscrupulous men, and ie back'H by untold millions of money. We
must oppose this great arganuattan with truth, good sense and absoluta
fearlessness. In addition ta this, we must also hate money for the
tipense will be heavy indeed.
WE WHO ARE IN HIARGE OF THE LEAGUE'S AF
