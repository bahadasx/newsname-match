NOT FEARING
REBEL FORGE
President of Chinese Repub
lic Not Uneasy Over Yun
Nan Uprising.
WORK HELPS APPETITE
Added Duties, Executive
Says, Tend Only to Make
Him Better Eater.
Peking, Feb. 19. In an exclusive In
terview with the correspondent of the
Associated Press at the palace today
President Yuan Shi Kal minimized the
importance of the rebellion now In
progress and expressed confidence In
the ability of the government troops
to suppress the uprising when ade
quate troops reach the upper Yang Tse
Kiang. Vice Admiral Tsal Ting Kan,
confidential secretary of Y'uan Shi Kal,
acted as interpreter.
"This is no campaign, but only a
skirmish," said Yuan Shi Kai; "but it
gives me so much work that it in
creases my appetite."
The president replied laughingly to
a remark regarding his excellent phy
sical condition and good spirits, refut
ing rumors of his ill health. Discuss
ing his enthronement, he said:
Discusses His Enthronement.
"Although a date in February was
sanctioned, the enthronement could
not take place because of the Yun Nan
rebellion, which necessitated military
operations. Therefore, it was decided,
with saddened hearts, to postpone it."
The president said the drafting of
a new constitution would be begun in
a few days. When it is finished,- the
constitution will go before a national
convention for suggestions. He did
not predict the date of promulgation
of the constitution. Discussing its na
ture, he said:
"We shall adopt from all countries
the provisions best suited to China,
without leaning toward any foreign
constitution."
Yuan Shi Kai had this to say re
garding probable recognition of the
monarchy:
"I cannot tell what governments
will or will not delay. Each will rec
ognize the monarchy according to cir
cumstances." China Maintaining Neutrality.
Regarding China's position as af
fected by the war, the president said:
"China has made every effort to
maintain strict neutrality. The Chi
nese government is not aware that the
entente powers or the other belliger
ents have made any substantial charg
es against us for not having done so.
China will endeavor to remain on
friendly terms with all the treaty
powers."
Yuan Shi Kai then reverted to the
Insurrection.
"Yun Xan and Kwei-Chow have few
troops and little ammunition," he said.
"How soon the rebellion will be crush
ed depends upon the roads and the ra
pidity of communication. You must
remember that it was easy for the
rebels to make a short dash into Sze
Chuen, whereas the government troops
must make a difficult trip to reach the
rebels. Well supplied troops will
speedily suppress the rebels on reach
ing the scene.
"A few ambitious leaders, without
popular support, are engineering the
rebellion. The voting showed that the
public favors a monarchy."

FLOOD BECOMING
GRAVE AFFAIR IN
SOOTHERN STATE
New Orleans, La., Feb. 19. Increas
ed apprehension was felt today for the
2,000 or more persons marooned around
Newellton, without food and with but
scant shelter. Most of them are negro
plantation laborers unable to reach
safety when the Mississippi river broke
through the levee at the Buck Ridge
plantation. The crevasse is nearly 700
feet wide. The water is pouring
through the crevasse four miles an
hour. A quarter semi-circle with a
radius of 25 miles is flooded from six
to 15 feet deep, while beyond -tflfl
anotner zo mues is coverea wun wa
ter from a few inches to one and two
feet deep.
The flood will not reach its climax
for at least a week, authorities predict.
Concordia parish in northeast Louis
iana is almost entirely covered with
water.
Flood waters from the Buck Ridge
crevasse and backwater from the
Black, Red and Old rivers together
with water from the broken levees of
the Arkansas river have dotted north
east Louisiana with several large lakes.
It is believed they eventually will
converge into one huge lake, 85 miles
by 50 miles, covering the parishes of
Tensas, Concordia, Franklin and Cata-
i houla except in a few high spots.
BOMB DESTROYS
H0MEJ1FBANKER
Owner Tells of Receiving Threatening

Signed "Black Hand."
Chicago, Feb. 19. A bomb which
was exploded today at the home of
Modestlno Mastrogiovanni in Grand
Boulevard wrecked the front of the
building but did not Injure any of the
occupants. Mastrogiovanni a year
ago was the proprietor of a private
bank, the affairs of which ere now be
fore the bankruptcy court. He told of
receiving threatening letters signed
the "Black Hand," but said that he
believed the explosion was the work
of some depositor enraged over the
loss of his money.
"Some individual angry over what
happened to the bank is responsible,"
said Mastrogiovanni. "The man who
signed the letter wanted money, thou
sands of dollars. The letters were
signed 'black hand' but I do not think
they came from any organization."
The explosion shattered the win
dows in several nearby houses.
The Mastrogiovanni home is in a
fashionable district and there was
much excitement in the neighborhood,
many rushing to the street. The blast
shook houses for blocks around and
the police declared that from the force
exerted that the bomb was apparently
filled with nitro-glycerine.
Damages amounting to $5,000 was
done by the explosion.

Chicago, Feb. 19. A murder so care
fully planned that even the grave was
dug was revealed today in a confes
sion by Mrs. Josephine Zdrowski, her
husand, Teofil Zdrowski, and Alex
Metelski, who, the police say, admit
hitting Tony Sandrovich repeatedly on
the head with an axe, at a farm six
miles west of Benton Harbor, Mich.
Sandrovich, who was 55 years old,
and was employed on the farm rented
by Zdrowski, was believed by the trio
.ess a considerable amount of
money, the police say the confession
states, but only $35 was obtained.
Sandrovich was lured to the farm,
according to the police. Hearing that
he carried in his clothes considerable
money, the police say Mrs. Zdrowski
told them, they asked him to come to
work on the farm, planning to kill
him.
"On the night before the murder,"
the confession reads, according to po
lice, "we sent to South Bend for a lot
of whiskey. We drank all we wanted
when Sandrovich came and he had a
lot, too. When he fell asleep Metelski
hit him twice on the head with an axe.
He moved a little and my husband hit
him with the axe. We already had the
grave dug and we threw his body into
it and left on the next train for Chi
cago." Another man and his wife once
worked on the farm, Mrs. Zdrowski is
said to have told the police, and it was
planned to kill them for their money,
but she became frightened and pre
vented the crime.
Zdrowsky and Metelski, unaware
that Mrs. Zdrowski had confessed, first
denied all knowledge of the murder,
according to the police, but later also
confessed.

LAY FALL OF
TURK CITY TO
CLOSE UNITY
Complete Cooperation of the
Russian Troops Made Any
Defense Useless.
FIRST DETAILED STORY
Petrograd Gives Good Ac
count of Capture of the
Turkish Stronghold.
Petrograd, Feb. 19, (via London,
11:52 a- m.) The first story in detail
of the capture of Erzerum by the Rus
sians reached PetrogTad semi-offt-cially
today. It shows complete co
operation of Russian troops over a
wide area, which made useless resist
ance on the part of the Turks. Ap
parently the Turks realized the fall of
Erzerum was inevitable and withdrew
most of their forces before the final
onslaught, leaving the garrisons of the
widely separated forts to their fate.
The campaign began to reach its
climax in the last days of January.
The troons of General P from
the north of General K from
the east, moved against the first
line under the most severe weath
er conditions. The Russians drag
ged their artillery to the heights
surrounding the fortress and when all
was ready began to bombard Fort
Kara Gudek, 20 miles, and Fort Da
lan Gez, 15 miles northeast of Erze
ium, preparatory to the bayonet as
sault. January 29 both fqrts capitulated.
Taking of Dalan Gez made a breach in
the outer line defer-"-
Boinu range in front of the city. The
capture of Kara Guusiv uc.o.
passage through the Kara Bagas pass
to the city proper from the northeast.
Fort Tafta lies midway between
these two fortresses. In ,a night at
tack on Jan. 30 this fort was captured,
leaving only Chaban Bebe between the
two armies operating from this quar
ter. Russians Effect Junction.
On Feb. 2, the Russians began to
storm the whole front line on the
Beve Boinu heights. By evening all
these positions were in Russian hands,
permitting complete junction of the
troops on the northeast. The fall of
this first line quickly decided the fate
of the inner forts.
Meanwhile the Palan Teken group of
forts, seven miles to the south, had
been surrounded on three sides. The
general assault on the second line be
gan without giving the men time for a
rest. The five inner forts made only
a feeble resistance. Their garrisons
beat a hasty retreat into the city and
followed the bulk of the troops which
already were on the roads leading
westward.
Turks Evacuate Forts.
Only the rear guard took part in the
fighting of the last day. Signs that
the evacuation was under way were
observed immediately after the fall of
the first fort.
It is thought possible the Turks
will attempt to make a stand at the
first favorable point, which is in the
hills on the western edge of Erzerum
valley, 11 miles distant, but it is not
regarded as probable that they have
been able to erect any extensive forti
fications there.
The Russians are hastily repairing
the small damage done to the fort
resses against a possible attempt of
the Turks to retake them.
No news has been received of the
fate of Ekved Pevzi Pasha, commander
of the Ninth corps, who was in charge
of the defense of Erzerum.
Reinforcements Fail to Arrive.
It Is reported that reinforcements
from Thrace were on the way to Er
zerum but that they were still five or
six days distant when the city was
surrounded. Artillery had been
shipped by sea to Trebizond.
A telegram from Sebastopol reports
the bombardment of Vitzesu, on the
Black sea, 15 miles cast of Trebizond.
The Turks are evacuating.
The reference in the foregoing to
Ekved Pevzi Pasha as the commander
in charge of Erzerum before its sur
render apparently disposes of unoffi
cial reports of several weeks ago that
the Turkish army there was in charge
of the German field marshal. Von Der

BRITISH REMOVE
TEOTONS ABOARD
STEAMER CHINA
Shanghai, China, Feb. 19. The
American steamship China, which left
Shanghai yesterday morning for San
Francisco was held up on the high
seas by a British auxiliary cruiser and
38 Germans were taken off.
The China which is owned by the
China Mail Steamship company, is the
only trans-Pacific line flying the
American flag. It Is thought she may
have been held up by the Laurentic,
which recently stopped the Tenyo Maru
and removed nine Indians.
Washington, Feb. 19. Similar infor
mation regarding the removal of Ger
mans from the American liner China
has been received by the state depart
ment from its representatives in China,
No action has yet been taken by the
United States, but it is probable a pro
test will be made to Great Britain.
American vessels in the Pacific have
been held up previously during the
war by British warships. In August
of 1914, the China, then owned by the
Pacific Mail Steamship company and
the Manchuria of the same company
were halted by British warships off
Hong Kong and forced to surrender 40
German reservists. Officers of the
China said Great Britain in their opin
ion had acted within her rights. The
Manchuria was boarded within the
three-mile limit.
A similar situation arose last Decem
ber when a French cruiser held up four
American steamships on their way
from Porto Rico to New York and re
moved Germans and Austrians. The
United States protested and the French
government released the men'.
INSURANCE SOCIETY

tual Insurance association.

Manila, Feb. 19. The Philippine

founding of which, with a capital of

THE WAR
TODAY
The recent comparative quiet
on the Franco-Belgian front has
not been seriously disturbed so far
as current statements reveal. The
only infantry movement reported
in today's French war office bulle
tin is what Is characterized as an
unimportant attack by the Ger
mans north of Blangy in the Ar
tois. This is said to have been eas
ily repulsed.
Russians are active along the
Black sea coast to the north, a Se
" bastopol dispatch reporting the
bombardment of Vitzesu, 15 miles
east of Trebizond. A Russian ad
vance landward In the direction of
Trebizond on the coast northwest
of Erzerum already has been un
officially reported.
There appears to be somewhat
greater military activity in Galicia
than for some daj s. Petrograd re
ports an Austrian offensive on the
Dniester near Cscieczko, an attack
being launched alter extensive ar
tillery preparation. The assault
was repulsed. It is declared.
Indications that some important
military incitement by the Ger
mans may be in preparation on
the western front are furnished by
advices from the Belgian frontier
received in Amsterdam. Heavy
troop movements have been in pro
gress in south and central Bel
gium, say the dispatches.
The capture of Erzerum by the
Russians continues to hold chief
interest in the war. Most of the
Turkish garrison escaped, but, ac
cording to reports from Petrograd,
the amount of booty, including
provisions and ammunition cap
tured, is enormous. The number
of guns which fell Into the hands
of the Russians is fully one thous
and. Russian newspapers point
out that the fall of Erzerum may
bring about the collapse of
the proposed German campaign
against the Suez canal and Egypt.
In the vicinity of Ypres, there
has been some severe fighting in
which the Germans claim to have
repulsed the British, indicting
heaiy casualties. South of the
Somme, fighting between the
French and Germans has consisted
of a few artillery duels.
In Albania, the A astro-Hungarians
have practically surrounded

Chicago, Feb. 19. Cyanide of potas

"The digestive organs, particularly
the stomach of the girl, show traces of
potassic cyanide," said Dr. Webster.
"There is no trace of any other poison
and I am positive there was no mixture
