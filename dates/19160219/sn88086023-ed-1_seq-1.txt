land. Taking evidence began In June
1414, The city of Astoria filed a
complaint against the Spokane, Port

the only rallfoad reaching there. The
Astoria people Consider the decision
removes the only obstacle in prevent

WASHINGTON, Feb. 19.--Germany
biundered when she issued the decres
of warfare against merchantmen and
is now trying to find a way out of
the difficulties, according to the In
ti rpretation some officials placed up
on Carl Ackerman's Berlin dispatches
saying Germany does not want to b
questioned closelv regarding her
methods of pursuing submarine war
fare. It Is thought the story consti
tuted a hint the Teutons realize thev
have placed themselves in an awk
ward position.
It is thought Berlin may willingly
Meld her position to America, but she
is puzzled how to do this without rais
ing an outcry in Germany. Lansing
declined to comment on Ackerman
dispatch. Another department off:,
cial said:
"Austria and Germany have blund
dered. They made a mistake in issuing
the decree w hich. In effect. Is an ultl
n.atum. The prlrfclpal effect thus far
is to impair seriously the relations be
tween America and Germany. When
there was some sympathy with the
contentions about armed ships, the

ca could not possibly accede to. Out
Position already has been officially
expressed and is that any modifies -tlcn
of the armed merchantmen phase
of international law can only be
achieved by an agreement of all con
rned. It is as much an usurpation
of authority for the central powers
to make such a declaration aa for
America to change the international
law on the subject."
