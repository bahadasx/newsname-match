VOLUME XXVI--NO 18. OPELOUSAS, LA., SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 19, 1916. $1,00 PER YEAR
THE SANITARIUM TO
BE OPENED SIORTLY
Dr. Daly Announces That He Will
Be Ready for Busines Soon
LOCAL PEOPLE SHOULD
PATRONIZE INSTITUTION
It Is Expected That Opelousas Will
Have Full Fledged Sanitarium
In the Next Ten Days
The Opelousas Sanitarium will be
thrown open to the public within
*the next couple of weeks, according S
to an announcement made by Dr.
O. P. Daly, Jr., recently. The san- r
itarium will be situated in the J.
K. Sandoz building, Main and Gro
lee streets.
For the past several years the 9
people of Opelousas have been de- s
manding a sanitarium and several
attempts were made by local doc
tors and progressive citizens to t
have a sanitarium erected, all with
out avail. A few months ago, how
ever, Dr. Daly, son of the well I
known president of the school,
board, came to Opelousas and 2
broached the subject of erecting a t
sanitarium here and ihe has met
with a hearty response and was
k ashured that the local physicians
would co-operate with him.
For the past week Doctor Daly i
and his associates have been busily
engaged straightening things out t
in the Sandoz building and receiv
ing furndture; plumbers are work
ing to jix everything in tip-top and
modetrn and up-to-date shape.
'Tole Opelousas Sanitarium should
be patronized by the people of this
cityj and surrounding country from
ithe, very beginning; that Dr. Daly
has the interest of the community
:f heart, as well as his own is a
' ertainty and the doctors who will
~ve charge of the new enterprise
ri11 put forth their very best efforts
make the sanitarium a distinct
p eess from its inception.
Lafayette, Eunice and other
wns near Opelousas are operat
sanitariums successfully and
the opinion of the business men
this city Opelousas certainly
t to be able to do as well as
Ssister towns .
The exact date of the opening
f the sanitarium will be made
wn shortly.

FARMERS PREPARING FOR
COMING BUMPER CROPS
Fertile Lands of St. Landry Being
Tilled Prior to Planting
Season
The farmers of St. Landry, where
there is no danger of high water,
have been kept busy for the past
few weeks tilling their soil pre
paratory to planting. I
From reports current in various
portions of the parish it won't be
surprising to see the farmers of old
St. Landry put more land into cot
ton this year than at any time
since the advent of the boll wee
vils.
The knights of the soil are con
templat ing harvesting a bumper
Irish potato crop, if the weather
continues to be as ideal for this
Crop as at presoti: several hun
dred acres are beirg planted in this
cr'op in the surrounding country.
T'h, disappointrnent over the
corn crop last year w-ill not
,daunt the farmners this year, how
ever, as it is very sldom that this
crop ever fails in St. Landry; lands
Sarte being tilled for this crop tbo
Sandi many farmiers are preparing to
Splant early, as well as late varie
S ties of corn.
'No forecast, .however, can be
made as the probable result of t;e
crops in St. Landry, but it is
argued that seven years of "hard
luck" have passed and t'his is the
year of "big doings," consequently
S bumper crops can be expected.

TORRENT SPEEDING
ON TO DESTRUCTION
THE FLOOD IS SAID TO BE THE MOST DANGEROUS IN THE HIS
TORY OF THIS C OLUNThY WITH
BREAK IN ATCHAFALAYA
There is no concealing t.e iact
that the high water situation is
extremely serious.
Already the levees of the Missis
sippi and Atchafalaya rivers have
given way to the onrush of tor
rents of water, pouring into the
swamps and plains of several of
,.ouisiana's fertile parishes.
Two Louisiana levees broke
Tuesday, at Buck Ridge, in Ten
sas, on the Mississippi and at a
point four miles from Melville,
only a short distance from thle I:`
toric break of 1912.
While the state engineers are
optimistic in public expressions at
least, old river men, and people
who have lived in the high-water
zone all their lives, declare that
the present situation is the gravest
in the history of the country, and
are open in their apprehension of a
disastrous water condition.
The two breaks which occurred
in this state on Tuesday have al
ready wrought havoc and destruc
tion, but it is feared that the worst
is yet to come.
With the water that crashed into
the St. Landry swamps on Tuesday
noon seven hundred feet of Atchaf
alaya levee disappeared; an hour
later the crevasse had increased

' week by Mr. E. M. Boyd, who ha
received much encouragement from
those whom he met and converse
with on the subject.
Gus Carriere, well known mar
ager of the Washington Cotton O
Company, was in this city one da
this week to transaet business.
1- John Sibille, a prosperous your
5- farmer of Grand Coteau, transacte
business in this town on Monda
to one thousand feet and the hopes
of closing up the mammoth hole in
the levee had vanished.
It is hinted that the levee was
deliberately cut, so as to avoid a
break on the Pointe Coupee side.
It is probable that the Texas &
Pacific and the Frisco railroads
will have to cease operations with
in the next few days, although
their tracks are high and dry, but
it will not take long, it is expected
that the water will be flooding the
entire country between Port Barre
and the Atchafalaya river.
All the lakes and bayous be
tween Opelousas and Melville are
rising, it is said, as a result of the
Atchafalaya break.
The people of Melville have no
apprehension of danger, at present;
that town is working valiantly to
protect itself from the back waters
and it is the hope of the people of
Melville that it will not suffer this
year as it did in 1912.
Cattle and horses in the swamps
between Port Barre and the river
are being taken out as rapidly as
possible and it is expected that
when the worst comes very few
animals will suffer on account of
the high water.
TUESDAY SEES THE CLOSE
OF THE HUNTING SEASON
Strict Enforcement of New Laws
Has Brought Increase of
Bird Life
The last day of the 1914-1915
hunting season was Tuesday, Feb
ruary 15, and instructions have been
sent the conservation agents in dif
ferent parts of the state by M. D.
Alexander to enforce strictly the
various conservation laws relative
to the game season.
Save for a few portions of the
state that suffered from an over
flow of salt water in the two gulf
storms that hit Louisiana last Au
gust and September, the waterfowl
season has been a lively one for the
gunners. The decision of the Con
servation Commission some sea
sons ago, to abolish spring shoot
ing, is believed to have been an
important factor in the great in
crease of duck life observed this
year.
After Friday, trusty guns were
oiled up and laid away until next
November, when the hunting sea
son will come on again, and when
even a greater season for ducks
may be expected, as the federal
migratory bird law is protecting the
birds that go to the North for nest
ing purposes.
"I am very glad to be able to
testify that the game laws iii Lou
isiana are better observed the past
few years than ever before," said
Mr. Alexander in discussing the
closing of the game season. "The
commission at all times has en
deavored to keep in close touch
with the sportsman and those who
gun for market, so that the best
methods of conserving the wild
life of the state may be put into
practice. The members of the com
mission feel that their efforts in
this direction are appreciated. Our
campaign of education over a cam
paign of jail" sentences is bearing
I fruit everywhere and it is my in
tention to follow this method in the
future.
"During the summer we will ar
range matters so that the federal
law, if it is sustained, and the state
law, will coincide in every partic
ular. I apn to call a meeting of the
sportsmen of Louisiana and others
1who know wild life conditions and
so adjust matters that the varies
sections of the state will have equal
opportunities in following their
favorite pastime."

COMMISSION FORM IS A
BEINi iURiGE AGAIN
Measure Once Defeated by Voters of
Opelousas Is Discussed
WOULD PRECIPITATE
INTERESTING FIGHT
Rumored Petition Asking for Elec
tion Will Be Submitted to the
City Council Soon
Commission form of government d,
for Opelousas is being discussed pi
by citizens and taxpayers. Rumors pr
are afloat to the effect that the city dh
'ouncil might be presented with a St
petition from the people of Opelou- w
sas urging the call of an election (
to decide the matter. hi
It will be remembered that on the pf
25th of November 1913 the voters
of Opelous s by a majority of some th
twenty vot went on record as op
posed to the measure. When the
question frst came up then it was
pointed out that it would carry by
an overwhelming majority; in fact w
no one was opposing the proposi- ai
tion, but when the voters were d
counted on November 25th, 1913, it
was ascertained that a majority had d
cast their ballot against the meas- d
Ire.
There are splendid features to v
the commission form of . govern
ment, many argue, but the officials p
have only recently been elected and h
as Opelousas has an efficient gov- A
ernment under the present alder
'.anic system the matter should not
be br6ught up before the voters
until 1917, just prior to the city c
election.
There is no doubt that if the city h
council should decide to call an
election putting this quiestion right ei
up before the people, a battle royal
will ensue, as it is understood that
several of the most popular muni- tl
cipal officials are diametrically op
posed to the proposition, while t
others, eq ially as strong, in poli
tics, are booked as being in favor a
of commission form of government.
A large number of the large cit
ies of the United States, as well as
cities of five and ten thousand pop- t!
ulation have adopted this form ofi f
governmvdht. -n-n-Louisiana Lake if
Charles, Baton Rouge and New F
Iberia are among the towns oper- G
ated under the commission form of,
government, which are prospering.
Since Op'elousas has managed its '
affairs in such a splendid manner
for the past several years many c
voters are opposed to changipg the f,
-zovernmental system, as long as c
1oanditions continue to be good. It
Just what will be done relative t
to calling the election on commis-i
sion form of government, prior tol,
the general election in April re-j
mains to be seen. In the event that
the matter shall be put before the
voters and should carry, it would
be necessary then, it is said, to hold t
a municipal election so as to se
lect officials under the new system. I

ANDRUS CHEERED BY
HUNDREDS OF VOTERS
COURTHOUSE IS PACKED TO OVERFLOW FOR ANDRUS POLITI
CAL RALLY LAST SUNDAY-CANDIDATE IS
ENTHUSIASTICALLY RECEIVED
The Andrus political rally which w
was held at the courthouse on Sun- di
day afternoon, at four o'clock, 01
proved to be the greatest and most st
enthusiastic meeting of any candi- 25
date for a minor office, ever held in
St. Landry parish. The crowd
which heard Mr. Andrus' eloquent
address is estimated at from three H
hundred and fifty to five hundred h,
people. at
Before the speakers appeared it e:
the court room there were several si
hundred men and ladies awaiting v(
the opening ofthe meeting. When
Mr. Andrus appeared the house st
went up into an uproar of applause o0
and it was evidenced that Mr. An- di
drus had the house with him. al
The venerable old Judge E. D. P
Estilette, who has known Mr. An- fc
drus since childhood, presided at la
the meeting and made a short but bi
very appreciative address in be- S1
half of the Grand Coteau boy. He tl
pointed out, in beautiful language, F
his friendly intercourse with the A
Andrus family, which dates back F
half a century, and in glowing sl
terms paid high tribute to the son s(
of Mentor Andrus. In urging the to
candidacy of Mr. Andrus, Judge ft
Estilette stated that he had always al
known Mr. Andrus to be a model it
husband, a devoted and faithful a,
employee and honorable to the core. c!
When a young man Mr. Andrus tl
was emplbyed by Judge Estilette; t(
the same manner in which he b
conducted the targe mercantile ti
business of the jidge, he conducted q
the business of all other men, with P
whom he was employed, pointed f.
out Mr. Estilette. M
After closing his address with an p
eloquent appeal to the fair-miiided; p
unprejudiced voters of St. Landry A
to cast their ballot for the best a
fitted and most competent aspirant
for the office, of assessor, Judge N
Estilette called upon Dr. "C. A. t]
Gardiner, a .boyhood friend and 0
college chum of A. L. Andrus. f
Dr. Gardiner, while he is not an t
orator, made a splendid address, j
which was enthusiastically , re- f
ceived by the several hundred a
voters present, He refuted the j
charge that Mr. Andrus is supposed
to have knifed Sheriff Swords in )
the recent primary, by stating that t
he was one of the friends of Mr. N
Andrus who had requested Mr. r
Andrus to inform him should he t
deem Sheriff Swords' action in the a
recent campaign as being unfavor- r
able to him. Dr. Gardiner stated i
that he had waited for the word C
from Mr. Andrus, but had never re
ceived it. He was, a staune
Swords man, but considered Mr.t
Andrus' candidacy above all candi
dates running. It was charged that t
Mr. Andrus had double crossed,
Sheriff Swords, who was being vig- I
orously supported by Charles Thib- i
odeaux, one of Mr. Andrus' oppo
nents. Dr. Gardineir boldly as- I
sertedthat he had voted for Swords t
and that Mr. Andrus had not double I
crossed the sheriff, as he would i
have been the first one aware of I
that fact.
The speaker also pointed out
that Mr. Swords had called upon
the voters of St. Landry to disre
gard the statements and utterances
of District Attorney R. Lee Garland
and Judgq B. H. Pavy, who were op
I posing his candidacy; he claimed
that these gentlemen had been
elected to office, that they were
Snot being, opposed for the present
and that they had no right to use
the power of their office to crush
"a good Democrat." Dr. Gardiner
gracefully and forcibly used the
I same argument in regards to Sher
rif Swords, claiming that he, of all
Sothers, had no right to use his in
fluence and the power .of his office
to defeat Mr. Andrus; first of all,
Sbecause Mr. Swords had not stated
during the time he was a candidate
Sfor election whom he was support
Sing for assessor, and second be
I cause Mr. Andrus, eight years ago
and again four years back, had
1fought valiantly for Mr. Swords
- and had made speeches on every
g stump in St. Landry parish in be
g ha': of-4he candidacy of thee sher
a iff.
t After briefly reviewing the his
o tory of Mr. Andrus' life Dr. Gardi
y net concluded amid great ap
plause, after which the center of i
-attraetion, A. L. Andrus, himselfI
-arose to address the very enthusi
astic audience.
Mr. Andrus was prevei.ted from
tt speaking for several minutes, af
n ter he was on the rostrum, as the
audienee practically went wild
with applause. He began his ad
dress by thanking the voters of
Opelousas for having given him po
such a flattering support on the Di;
25th of January and assured those fro
who had opposed him that he on
would bear no malice against them, thi
whether he was elected or not. fre
He thanked the several ladies, wilc oni
had not feared the cold weather to thf
attend t'he meeting, and then pro- at
ceeded to make his appeal for the Io
support of the majority of the Op
voters of this parish. be
He briefly reviewed the cirl-u.n
stances prior to the announcement Op
of his candidacy. He told his an- on,
dience that it was not until sever- He
al months after Mr. Fontenot, the we
present assessor, had announced sa,
for sheriff, that Sbe decided to ste
launch his candidacy for assessor stk
before the Democratic electors of thi
St: Landry. At the beginning of by
the sheriff's campaign, when Mr.:
Fontenot asked his support, Mr. a I
Andrus stated that he told Mr. hi
Fontenot that he was bounu to a,
support Mr. Swords and would do gri
so vigorously, as he had done in the
the past. When he decid'"d to run w.
for assessor he went to the sheriff no
and frankly applied for advice, tell
ing Mr. Swords that if his race for Mr
assessor would injure Mr. Swords' we
candidacy that he would not enter 't.
the political arena. Mr. S irdds tio
told him to go and male his fight! fei
before the people, but to wait Un -1ve
til July, when he would get his
quietus from the state, and the peo- Se
ole generally, would overlook the rol
fact that two from the sai~e oiflce mi
were aspiring for public favor. He ar
promised Mr. Andrus ti. , remain jo
perfectly neutral and advised MIr. pe
Andrus to make a neutril fight,
also. Se
After consulting Sheriff Swords tUi
Mr. Andrus stated to his :Ctie .e, pr
that he went to Mr. Fo'ntent, the wi
other candidate for sheriff, and kin
formed that gentleman of hip in- Fl
tention to make a neutral fisht
Mr. Fontenot was perfectly satis
fled with Mr. Andrus' attitude and, NE
assured him that he would not
harm him in any manner whatever.
After making these arranje.mfents.
Mr. Andrus set out into the: .oun-
try to make a house to nojse i~an- pe
vass; from the returns of the first; of
primary Mr. Andrus is ev-ddentallyJ c
the favorite of the country people, ri
as he arrived in Opelousas on the hi
night of the election with over twe
C hundred votes ahead of his nAWre-'4 to
opponent, Charles Thibedrau..
Mr. Andrus told of Henry La- lo
strapes, Jr., urging him to makeI pl
the race for assessor, stating that ib
Mr. Lastrapes had assured him
, that he would support him, above ii
'all other candidates and that .nYr h:
one opposing Mr. Andrus would ai
not get his support, t
The speaker appealed to the un- .
- prejudiced voters not to allow their: tl
a factional feelings lead them to cast" e,
e their votes against him at the corm- p
I ing election. He made it plain that s+
f" he n ad not taken part for either e:
faction and he saw no reason why
t Sheriff Swords should fight him, N
a after he had done so much for the;
- sheriff, both in politics and other
s wise. (.
l Mr. Andrus has not and will not .n
- villify his opponent; he will not'
d allow his political enemies to drag t(
a him into any villifying campaign 11
e and hence he would not undertake h
Lt to ldeny ay charges brought forth t
e by b is enemies as to his position c
h in the recent sheriff fight, as he q
r had made it plain that he had a
e taklen no part in that fght.. .
Mr. Andrus concluded his address
Il with an eloquent, appeal for ais t
- elecltion, the crowd dispersed with *
e ch(eers for the next assessor. There
i, was no doubt in the minds of the
d larIsr, majority of those who heard
e Mr. Andrus that he had made athe
- best spneech heard in the campaign
- of 1915-16; he made an indeliblei
o impr.ssion on the minds of the unr
d proirdieed and unbiased voters,
