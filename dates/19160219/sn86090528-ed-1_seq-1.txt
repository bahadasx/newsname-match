ed, this morning, th..t a united effort
would be made, in the interests of bet
ter roads for the ten'- r.' tributary to

C:ic member of this committee stat
ed that he wanted to roc the split log
dnip River, a thorough try-out. He
s.nd be had heard so much of the fam-.
o-js U:d Inexpensive road machine that'
he l.e ieved a complete tenting of it
vmi.i! be found v.wt;t while. In this
lit e he cited the Rooi work which
Iuh been done it the Frisco addition
to C i ickasha, anacn other outlying
S(i:1i;nf of the city by Drin Beets,
. t eet commissioner. He also refered
to ihe work which has been done with
the drag by Jim H:.!. road overseer, on
the piece of road lying immediately
Ixv.ml the city timiis and leadng to
tb toll bridge.
.Sneaking further upon this matter.
tNi member of i'v committee, stater',
he lad read wtufo the nirchants in

I what they style"! a "good roads

ed, the speaker averred, that very
w:ny responded to th'i call and that
c.i the first good roaJ' day in that
particular tov.-n over one hundred of
those drags came in over the several
roads leading into the place. Some
of thoe dragging the road-makers ia
had come distances of from twelve to
fifteen miles. The nearer the town
those parties drew, the mora central
t'jsi became the work, so that the
four roads which lead into this particu
lar town hud not less thnn 2r drnggings
each. The one trip cofit th-3 merchants
who had entered iuto the agreement
trifle over $200, but, after tho work
l.ad been done an inspection made,
they all decided the money had uten
fill invested.
"The sooner wo all," said the speak
er, "eliminate the idea that the matter
of good roads is au expense and real
ize that it is an investment, the sooner
will we have good roads leading nto
Chickasha from every direction, while
uaily additions to our revenues will be
brought into the city." -
Another thing which the members
of the committee are heartily in favor
ot advancing win De me cvic attrac

they wiil ask the co-operation of the

tion will not be denied.
An effort will be made to have flow

city. In the latter instance the con
currence of the mayor and the mem
hers of the city council will be sought
One member of the committee in
speaking of the park question said
"Chickasha property is cheaper now
than it ever will be again. The city
like an individual, may secure some of
this chean property, and my idea is
tl at this would be the thing to do ge:
one or two pieces of vacant property
and beautify them and make them Iu
to placet- of pleasure resort.'

SAYS U.
FLAG CAN'T
SAVE SHIP
Noted German Writer Quoted as Saying
that Teutons Must Soon Disregard
Rights of Neutrals Unless
Allies Agree to Peace
By United Press.
LONDON, Feb, 19. "No stars and
stripes will protect a ship in the war
zone."
The above statement is credited to
Waxmilian Harden, the noted German
publicist, by an article- that is printed
in the London Time3.
Harden is quoted as -warning the
I'nited States and other neutral na
tions that unless the allies agree to
peace in the near future, Germany
must disregard neutral rights and
"fight for her own salvation."
"There is still a short space of time
during which Germany might come to
terms," the writer says. It is suggest
ed that the peace efforts might in
clude a little disarmament, a little in
ternational socialism and a proposal to
pool war expenses.
"If these proposals are refused," says
the writer, '-'Germany will have paid
her last debt to the world and human
ity and can proceed in the most fright
ful manner ever known with complete
indifference.
"America must reconcile herself to
the conviction that no further hesita
tion can cripple our submarine war
faro and no stars and stripes can pro
tect a ship in the war zone."

were there to, including the judges of
the impromptu debate pulled off by the
gentlemen naiiiedi in count one, of this
indictment.
Arrayed in all the glory of his plum
age, when the flights of oratory began,
the great bird of frtedom was like
wise present in the "little red school
house." . But
"E Pluribus Unum" had lost all his
tail feathers when adjournment came
about in the natural course of human
events.
Armed with oral artillery, Swan and
Cox' and Woody and Lee volleyed and
thundered and assailed the glorious
bird and deplummed him and scatter
ed great hands full of his brilliant
feathers about tho atmosphere until
the judges came in and settled the
mooted question - relative to heredity
and environment and permitted the
kingly bird to fly a-way into the secret
recesses of his boudoir, there to clothe
himself in a kitnona until hisi natural
habiliments shall be returned from the
pressing parlors.
