SIXTEEN NUMBERS ON PROGRAM
Many Out-of-town Visitors In Crowd
of Young People at Foresters'
Hall Last Evening.
Was the "whole town" there?
It was!
It was there because the telephone
girls gave one of the most enjoyable
dances of the season at Foresters'
hall last evening with an attendance
of about 125 couples.
There are dances and dances! But
it takes the bewildering crew of local
"Hello-Girls" to put on a danco event
that packs the local hall and yet re
ceives the honest endorsement that
"a good time was had by all."
To begin with: The committee on
decorations, consisting of Miss Delia
Camp, Miss Cecile Dorion, Miss Mary
Kyan and Thomas Fitzgerald
decorated the hall with pine boughs
and evergreen and decorated it
"right." The orchestra was hidden
behind a bank of spruce trees at the
northeast corner of the main hall and
the walls were pannelled in large
squares of evergreen that made one
of the prettiest trimming schemos
carried out in the hall for several
seasons.
Then the music committee, com
posed of Miss Bessie Shea, Miss Lena
Thompson, Miss Lida Pellerln and
Miss Julia Connelly arranged with
Bennington's sturdy wielder of the
fiddle-bow, George Donnelly, for a
program of catcny ana up-tc-tne-
minute music. The orchestra, with
Miss Mary L. McGurk at the . piano,
lived up to their, previous reputation
as pleasing purveyors of tuneful per
mutations and in return for continued
applause gave two and three encores
to several of the numbers. The
dances were as follows:
One Step Circus Day in Dixie
Waltz When I Was a Dreamer
Two-Step
Kaleidescope
One Step
My Sweet Adair
Medley
America, I Love You
Chin Chin
Waltz
Fox Trot
I'm Going to Bring a Wedding Ring
One-Step Little Gray Mother
Intermission
One-Step
When I Leave the World Behind
Waltz Little Bit of Heaven
Two-Step My Little Girl
Waltz Geraldine
Five-Step
. Good-Bye Girls, I'm Through
One-Step Tulip Time In Holland
Rye Waltz Comin' Through the Rye
One-Step Jane
Dainty folders, giving the order of
the dances with a cut of a telephone
Instrument on the cover containing
the wcrds appended: "Out of Order"
(for the evening) were distributed.
Nearly all of the younger set of the
town were present in sleek dress;
suits and a dazzling assortment of
gowns, some exceptionally pretty
costumes being worn by many of the
ladies.
The affair began about 9 o'clock,
but it was past ten o'clock before the
floor was filled, and the repeated en
cores carried the final one-step well
Into the morning.
This is the 10th annual affair that
the phone girls have held and both
from a social and financial standpoint
it was a good success. It is improving
increasingly popular from year to
year and as attendants are mostly
by direct invitation the girls have
succeeded in providing an attractive
annual function.
Beside the above mentioned com
mittees, the success for the affair of
1916 goes to Mr. and Mrs. W. E. Bis
sell, general chairman, Miss Mary
Butler, Miss Louise Burns, Miss Eliz
abeth Nealon and Miss Clara Pellerin

SPINAL MENINGITIS EPIDEMIC
Two Have Died In Brandon and Third
; May Succumb. ,
Brandon, Feb. 17. What appears
to be a severe epidemic of spinal
meningitis began here last Friday af
ternoon, when the sudden death of
Zeno Hopkins occurred. The same
afternoon Miss Fanny Peabody, daugh
ter of James Peabody, was taken sud
denly ill, and shortly afterward Mr.
Peabody was stricken with tho same
disease. Ho died Wednesday after
noon. Miss Peabody is in a serious
condition and it is not expected she
will live. A consultation of physici
ans from Burlington and Tlconderoga
was held and the disease pronounced
spinal meningitis. Charles V. Need
ham is also seriously ill with the
samo disease.
, As all who have contracted the dis
ease were in a play given at the town
hall last week Wednesday evening, it
is thought that they may have got
the, disease from some of the ' cos
tumes or wigs rented from a Boston
firm. Both Miss Peabody and young
Hopkins were members of the high
school and as a precaution it was
thought best to close the ' , Vrhol
school for the remainder of the week.
r. Caverly, president of the State
board of health, was in Brandon to
day, but did not think it necessary to
postpone any of the public entertain
ments unless a further spread of the
disease was evident.
GATES FAVORS PERRY BILL
Governor Not In Favor of Local Op
tion Liquor Law.
Franklin, Feb. 15. Governor Chas.
W. Gates, feeling that he has been
misrepresented in a booklet issued by
the Vermont Local Option League,
the organization which is conducting
the campaign against the Perry pro
hibition bill which will be submitted
to tho voters of Vermont at the
March meeting, has made public a
statement which he hopes" will serve
effectually to correct any false views
which the offending article may have
given rise to.
, Governor Gates U well known as
having decided views on tho liquor
traffic, question,, but despite his sin
cere convictions he has felt ' It the
wis thing not to take any active
part lu the campaign ' occasioned by
the submission of the referendum to
tho people, and would have refrainod
from any statement had he not felt
that he was forced to do so. Gover
nor Gates uses the following words: i
"I have just received a copy of the
booklet issued by the Vermont Local
Option League,. in which my name,
as governor, appears prominently tn
such a manner as to lead the reader
to think that I am In favor of local
option on the liquor question.
"I have positive convictions on this
subject as many well know, but I
have purposely refrained from allow
ing tho use of my official position to
influence the vote on the Perry bill
next March because I am deeply con
scious of my obligation, as governor,
to all the people in the State, and in
the course of corresiondence I made
my position clear to tho secretaries of
both organizations.
Notwithstanding this, my name has
been used, ate above stated, by the Lo
cal Option League without my know
ledge or consent in such a manner
and in such connection that the im
piesaion conveyed by its use not only
misleads, but also grossly' misrepre
sents my position. For this reason I
feel warranted in making this public
statement. . .' ,
"The words quoted in the booklet
from my inaugural address express
my position precisely and I would not
alter a word used therein. They were
used in considering constructive work
by the State, but not Uie destructive
work of those evils that call for the
exercise of the police powers of the
State.
"I am not in favor of the principle
of local option as applied to the liquor
question, but am in favor of prohibi
tion and shall vote for the Perry bill."
Bored For. Hia Title.
There Is u popular belief that titles
often fall to the importunate. It was
an old colonial oflice official who.' when
asked why a certain individual had re
ceived a K. C. M. G., pointed to a hole
in the carpet in front of his desk. "Do
you see that?" said he. "X. wore that
hole when representing to uie his
claims to be knighted. Matters even
tually reached such a pitch that we
saw that we must either give him the
title or buy a new carpet. So we gave
him the K. O. M. G." London Chron

RIGHT TO ATTACK
H MERCK
SHIPS DENIED
., Wminisf ation's Position Reveal
ed in Order to Consuls
GERMAN REFUSAL EXPECTED
Berlin Likly to Insist That Subma
rines which Give Warning Must
Not Be Attacked.
Washington, Feb. .18. All
American diplomatic and consular
officials abroad have been notified in
a circular communication from . the
btate department that the position of
the United States is that merchant
ships have a right to carry defensive
armament.
This move, which became known
today, is the first formal announce
ment that the United States does not
accept as legal the announced inten
tion of Germany and Austria to sink
armed merchant ships without warn
ing after February 2D as coming
within international law.
Germany's response to the latest re
quest of the United States for assur
ances that submarine warfare will be
conducted in accordance with estab
lished principles of international law
is expected here to be a flat statement
that assurances previously given in tho
Lusltania and Arabic cases had to do
only with unarmed vessels, and that
the German government must feel cer
tain that its submarines which warn
a merchant ship will not bo attacked.
Furthermore, the Berlin office probably
will ask the United States for Its defi
nition of defensive armament.
Indications of what the German re
ply may be are understood to have
been given In informal conservations
between state department officials and
Teutonic diplomats since Germany and
Austria announced their intention of
sinking ell armed enemy merchantmen
after February 29. ; , , , .
The dispatches to the consuls con
tained excerpts from newspaper arti
cles setting forth the position of; the
United States. , ''
it is thought certain that the quest
ion of defining defensive' armament
will be the basis of lengthy negotia
tions with tho central powers begin
ning when the reply is received to
the message outlining the views of
the United States which Count von
Bernstorff, the German ambassador,
has sent his government. The re
sponse is not expected before the last
of next week.
STATE BUILDING CONTRACTS
Commission Accepts Bid of George "i .
Kelly of Yonkers. .
Montpelier, Feb. 17. The State build

tract for the construction of the build
ing to be used for the State library,
supreme court, etc., to the lowest bid
der, George T. Kelly of Yonkers, N.
Y., whoso bid was $139,4SS. The com

After Lagrippe What?
Coughs that "hang on' after lagrip-"

Ind., writes. "An attack of lagrippe

everything. I lost in weight and got
so thin it looked as if I would never
