CANAL TREATY
IS RATIFIED
Senate Approves Agreement
Giving U. S. Nicaraguan
Property and Naval Base.
ASSURANCES OF AMITY GIVEN
SOUTH AMERICAN REPUBLICS
For Sum of $3,000.000 Nation Gets
Waterway Zone, Two Islands in
Caribbean and New Base.
Hy vote of SB to 18 the Senate yeaterday
ratified the treaty with Nicarauga, under
which the United States acquires a strip
of property in Nicaragua known as "the
canal route" and alao the right to estab
lish a naval base on the Gulf of Fonseca.
For thie concession the united States
agrees to pay Nlcarauga the sum of
f..O00.OtM. Fifteen Republican Senators
voted to ratify the treaty; five Demo
cratic Senatore voted against ratifica
tion.
The treaty was originally submitted by
Secretary Bryan, but it has been much
modified to meet objections, or It would
have failed. The resolution of ratifica
tion carried a proviso submitted by Sen
ator Brousaard assuring the protesting
Central American republics of the good
intentions of the United States and de
claring that the rights of these states
would b? ea-?esuarded.
The grant to the United States by
Nicarauga under the terms of the treaty
comprises "the exclusive proprietary
Tights neccaaary and convenient for the
const ruction, operation and maintenance
of a interoceanlc canal by a Nicaraguan
route, the lease tot 99 yeara of Great and
Little Corn Islands in the Caribbean
and the right to estatbllsh a naval base ,
on the Gulf of Fonaeca"
The treaty also concedes an option to
the United States or renewing the leases
and grants for a further term of 93
years. The territory leased 1? to pass
under the laws and sovereignty of the
I'nlted States. The property granted was
not made free of tax?e In the treaty
proper, but the reaolution of ratification
carried language by way of an amend
ment which renders the property "for
ever free from all taxation or other
public charge."

an extraordinary article in his paper. Die

to be compelled to lay waate fresh areas
of tho world and redouble her triumph
of dealh, bui aa no longer abl? to '-?
content with an interminable defensive.
The article ?tys:
By Maximilian Harden
(Ai translated from the Oerman by the
L-ondon Times.)
?Six months ago the Gei mans could be'
content with defense, holding and using j
?what they had conquered. Now tt Is tool
; late? Can we wait until the enemy has
spied out every feature of our system, i
military an-d economic, and until there |
creeps upon us a state of want which |
at present is falsely reported?
A third ha n'est would be more difficult
than the second. It would be difficult to
make pood our suppli?e, not of men. but
of important raw materials, and our ex
penditure of money would increase Im
moderately.
After three years of blockade others
would occupy these places in the mar
kets from which It seemed impossible
that German trade should be expelled.
Dare we wait? No!
There is still a short m .**-- ?* of time
during which Germany might come to
terms. Without loss of honor her eneml^i
might make a decent and enduring peace,
which would not bar the -way to gradual
reconciliation and Kuropean harmony.
These peace offers. It Is suggested,
might include a little disarmament, a
little International socialism, and a pro
posal to pool war expenses. If these pro
posals are refused Germany will have
paid the last debt she owed to the world
and humanity and can proceed to be
more frightful than ever, with complete
indifference to the views of neutrals, es
pecially the United tSates.
