A COMMUNICATION.
Lucy, La.
Feb 19, 1916
Editor Le Meschaceb6
Doar Sir:
The following extract t rom
Col. Pleasant in accepting nomi
nation given him by La. Demo
crats is of such intrinsic valuh,
that I am most confident that it
will be heeded by all thoughtful
men of this great commonwealth
who has had the opportunity of
reading same.
His wise and truthful sayings
are without the least doubt the
"sounding note" on which tne
pedestal of true Democracy rests.
"Our blackest pages have been
written by the hand of the Re
publican. His twin brother is
the Progressive. Both advocate
ideas in common. They are
united in Louisiana today for
pelf and power. Shall we sur
render to them the control of our
fair state so they may repeat the
history they have already made?
There are more than one han
dred thousand Democrats who
thunder, No!
There are those who have de
serted her; there are those who
have fed from her hand and now
oite her; but thank God. they are
1few. Her loyal sons are rallying
to the trumpet calU as of yore and
will place upon her brow proud
victory's crown once more."
After reading the above state
ment shall we stand idle until the
enemy has bound us hand and
foot? Fellod voters, sons of
Louisiana are we supposed to be
numbered among those who hav
ears, hear not, and ihaving eyes,
see not the thing which so nearly
concern their temporal salvatioon
Shall the solid foundation of our
present Democratic form of
government crumble in the dust?
Shall the wheel of progress and
prosperity again be checked and
shattered by the hand of Re
publicanism? No! Let as then
stand as a unit-as. a mighty
bulwatk and east out ballot on
April next for that bright and
honored Louisianian, Ruffin G.
Pleasant.

WHAT THE EDITOR
. SAYS. I
The Berthelot faction whici
m warmly supported Col. Pleasant',
li- candidacy for Governor in the
3- recent primary arid succeeded it
,, giving the Colonel a handusomf
it majority in the parish always ex.
Sli pected and hoped that the Hart
h1 faction and its official journal,
L'Observateur, would remain
within the ranks of stainless De
a mocracy and lend their loyal sup
e port to the nominee of the Dem
e ocratic party. It pleased us be
;. yond expression to note in the
n New Orleans papers sometime
ago that the leader of the oppo
S sition, Mr. Hart, a member of
e the State Central Committee,
e had been placed on the Commit
r tee on Resolutions and consented
to act and aid in framing out a
r platform upon which every true
Democrat mst stand. We com
plimented Mr. Hart upon his
sound and untrammeled democ
I racy. Although he and his faction
loyally supported Mr. Barret's
candidacy in the recent primary,
vet like a true democrat he con
ceived it to be his duty to abide
by the results of the democratic
r primary and support thenominee
t Col, Ruffin G. Pleasant.
I However, what surprised us
like a thunderbolt from a clear
. sky is the unqualified endorse
ment which the Republican Pro
gressive cnimdiate, Mr. Parker,
is recetving - through the columns
of our local contemlporary. L'Ob
servateur, the recognized organ
of the Hart faction. From these
circumstances we can draw only
one out of two pos3:ble con
clusions: either L'Ob.bervateur
has conderm:ed the course pursu
ed by. is leader, Mr. Hart, and
therefore deserted the ranks of
the Hart faction, or else, canced
ing that the Hart jo;rnal speaks
officially, the cnncusion is inevi
table th,,h rrz't; aidle that Mr.
Hart. in accepting thie appoint
ment and helping to frame out a
Pieasant-Democratic platform
acted as a traitor to the party
which he'l-d the pubiic to believe
he was actively supporting. Of
the two conclusions we prefer to
accept the former and we shall
cling to it until our contemporary I
L'Observateur, throws more
needed light upon the apparent,
dilemma.
