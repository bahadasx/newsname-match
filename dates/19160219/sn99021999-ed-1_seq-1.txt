SAYS MR. LODGE
Senator Holds that Any Change of
Policy Now Would Be Clear
Violation of Ken
trality.
MEANS STEP TOWARD WAR
Sefnial to Clear Merchant Ship
Armed for Defense Wonld Make
U. S. Ally of Kaiser.
WILSON'S FIRST POSITION EIGHT
WASHINGTON, Feb. lS.-enator
Lodge, ranking minority member of
the foreign relations committee.
made a speech in the senate today.
declaring; that abandonment by the
Untied States at this time of the
principle thst Its ports were open to
and its ritlr.ens free to travel upon
merchantmen ot belligerent nations
armed solely for defensive purposes,
would be an unneutral act and a step
toward war. He said It would make
the United States the ally of the bel
l'rerent whose merchant marine had
been swept from the seas.
As late ss the president's note of Msv
IX ISIS, signed hy Mr. Bryan. Senator
Iodge said, this government recognised
that "American cltlxena were within
their "Indlsputed r!ghu In taking their
ahlpa and In traveling wherever their legitimate-business
calls thent upon the
high seas."
Law Two Cent arte Old.
"Such," he added, "hss been the prac
tice of all nations In regard to the armed
merchantmen. It ' seems utterly Incred
ible that thla position should be In any
way altered now or that our government
ahould be ready to surrender - the un
questioned rights of Americans to travel
or ship goods on a belligerent merchant
man subject to all the rule which have
been established by the courts and by
all International authorities for at least
two centuries. The abandonment of those
rights by any neutral government on the
ground that the Invention of submarines
with the necessary limitations upon the
powers ot rapture possessed by those
boats Is Inconceivable. Ouch abandon
ment could only reat on the ground that
the rights of neutrals, the rules that for
centuries have been agreed upon by all
nations-for the protection of Innocent
lives upon vessels captured In war must
be thrown aside and discarded In order
that a now Instrument of maritime de
struction must not be Impeded In Its
work of death and murder. 8ueh a doe
trine Is revolting ia every instinct of
humanity, te ovoey-rrttiwiels ef law and
justice. -.".'"
. i Violation ef NentnUlty.
'"There IS. however, another aids to this
matter, which. Is of even graver Impor
tance. There can be no question that
any act by a neutral, which alters con
ditions created by the war Is an unneu
tral act and places the neutral upon the
side of one belligerent or the other.
"This Is eminently true of any form of
embargo, and there Is no need that I
should repeat the unanswerable argument
on this point embodied by Mr. Lansing in
his note of last August to the government
of Austria-Hungary. The war, and the
war alone baa also created conditions
under which any change at this time In
the attitude which we took officially at
the outset of the war In regard to armed
merchantmen would be an unneutral
act The merchantmen of one belligerent
have been swept from the seas. Therefore,
If we should abandon all the principles
on this subjeot that we have always
sustained, If we should abandon the rules
laid down by Mr, learning In hla circular
