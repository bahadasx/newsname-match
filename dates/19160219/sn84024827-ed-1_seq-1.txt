al charges against the Army Aviation
Service, with a demand for an im
mediate investigation by Congress
was made today before the Senate
Military Committee by Senator Rob
inson, of Arkansas. He declares the
service was "contemptibly inefficient",
and that Lieutenant Colonel Samuel
Reber was not only not making an
effort to improve it, but was deliber-J
ately preventing facets reaching his
superiors. The committee will act
Monday on Robinson's resolution.
Robinson charged that Reber
prompted Captain Cowan to practice
"contemptible deceit" toward con
gressmen visiting his aviation station
and had attempted to get Into the an
nual appropriation bill, in connection
with the item to purchase airships,
the provision to purchase accessories
with which they could build auto
mobiles. He said the colonel wrote the word
"accessories" be like charity and
cover a multitude. Some or the con
gressmen suggested an investigation

In Peru Marriage is Declared
to Be a Distinct Luxury for

Commission's Report
PANAMA, Feb. 18. Marriage is a

of the Commission on the Church in

where the rate of Illegitimacy is ap-

"Tne marriage institution," says the '
report, "appears to be weaker on the

The Commission draws a gloomy pic

Latin-America. "There is little popu-

normal issues and reforms. Every
