Mayor William Hale Thompson and the High Priests of His
Wing of the Republican Party Organize a New Municipal
Voters League. "Big Bill": Starts on the War Path After
the Scalps of the Aldermen Invading the Wards of Those
Who Bitterly Fight Him in the City Council
"Big BUI" Mayor William Hale
Thompson has been very much -wrought
up oyer the last report of the Mu
nicipal voter's league it heating him
up so hot that in order to sleep real
sound each night in the future he and
the other high priests of his wing of
the Republican party decided to or
ganize a brand new municipal voter's
league of their own so thaflhey can
boss it or run it to suit themselves.
The old time or the regular munici
pal voter's league which in its last
report or running off at mouth sat
down rather hard on Mayor Thompsonj
thigj week issued the f ollowing state
ment in reference to him and his new
league.
"The Municipal Voters' league wish
es to warn the public against the oper
ations of a gang of political counter
feiters who have been unearthed in the
city hall and who are making active
preparations to 'shove the queer.'
"It is thought that tho departure of
Sherlock Holmes from the city has en
couraged this activity, and it is sus
pected by some that Prof. Moriarity is
a member of this band.
"The boldness of this gang is so
great that they have, it is said, se
cured a state charter under the name
of 'Chicago Municipal Voters League,'
and it seems impossible that they can
long hope to escape detection.
Flan Aldennanic Reports.
"Their plan appears to be to issue
reports on aldermanic candidates which
shall bear a label, including the words
Municipal Voters' league. "Unsuspect
ing voters might naturally accept these
as genuine Municipal Voters' league
reports.
"No one counterfeits confederate
money. It is because the reports of the
Municipal 'Voters' league pass current
in this community that such counter
feiting looks like a profitable enter
prise. The counterfeiter tries to make
his stuff look like real money, and the
political counterfeiter does the same.
Imitation is the sincerest flattery, and
possibly the Municipal Voters' league
should feel pleased.
"We Tegret that we cannot at this
time furnish the public with Bertillon
measurements. We can, however, give
some description of those members
whoso identity has been betrayed by
the application for state incorporation
papers.
Takes Up "Band's" Members.
"Foremost stands Maj. Clinnin, in
private life a lawyer, and in public
Hfo an assistant corporation counsel.
The major ha3 been devoting consid
erable time to tho rather complicated
matter of getting the new organization

man 0 'Toole will successfully win out
at tho primaries Tuesday, February
29th.
Martin J. McNally, who is very wise
for his day and generation, Alderman

warm supporters of Alderman 0 'Toole,
are more than confident that the little

incorporated. The press states that
this has forced him to spend more or
less time in Springfield. It is to be
hoped that the public business of the
corporation counsel's office has not suf
fered in his absence.
"The second in command is Dr. E. B.
Miller, brother of City Prosecutor Mil
ler. Dr. Miller was until lately a city
sanitary inspector on temporary 'sixty
day' appointment. Last spring the
doctor carried a precinct in the Thirty
third ward for Thompson. Just the
man to look after the sanitary condi
tions of the political counterfeiters,

'acids' and 'plates' and other head
quarters paraphernalia are kept in a
clean and nonpoisonous condition.
"The third member is J. Lincoln
Pfaff. As Mr. Pfaff is a tailor of wide
experience, he will doubtless be assign
ed in charge of 'press' work.
Pictures Guiding Spirits.
"Who are the guiding spirits f" We
seem to see a shadowy form like one
of the gods of Norse mytoology brood
ing over a battlefield, but the mists
hide his face. He has not been pub
licly incorporated yet. And we see also
a large form, like the genie whom the
fisherman saw in the 'Arabian Nights,'
and who before the fisherman's aston
ished eyes grew smaller and smaller
and finally entered again in the metal
can from which he had emerged.
"We feel sure that there are other
members, for there is much good ma
terial available. A careful search of
the hotels in the vicinity of the city
hall will doubtless reveal them.

words of Lincoln: 'You can't fool all

After getting his league on its feet
Mayor Thompson decided to start on
the war path after the scalps of the
aldermen who continue to fight him in
the city council and then fade away
from now until the primaries he will
invade the 25th, the 3rd the 6th, the
7th wards and several other wards in
his effort to unhorse Alderman Frank
J. Link of the 25th ward, Alderman
Nathaniel A. Stern of the 3rd wardj
Alderman Willis O. Nance of the 6th
ward; Alderman John N. Kimball of
the 7th ward, and Mavor Thompson
feels that he will never rest well at
nights until he has the scalps of these
and other aldermen who have greatly
displeased him by voting against his
pet measures in the city council, dang-
ling to his belt.
ALDEEMAN HENEY P. BEEGEN
IS HOLDING HIS OWN IN THE
31ST WAED.
As the Aldermanic primaries draw
near, which will be held Tuesday, Feb
ruary 29th, the many friends and sup
porters of Alderman Henry P. Bergen,
are leaving no stone unturned, in their
efforts to return him to the city coun
cil. Neighborhood meetings are being
held nightly among the voters and
everything seems to indicate that he
has smooth or clear sailing at the pri
maries. Editor C. J. Perry, of Philadelphia,
Pa., spent a few days in this city the
first part of the week, enroute home
from Nashville, Tenn., where he at
tended a meeting of the National Ne
gro Press Association and was chosen
its president.

HARRY HILDRETH, JE., DEMO
CRATIC CANDIDATE FOB, THE
NOMINATION FOE ALDERMAN
OF THE SECOND WARD, TO BE
VOTED FOE AT THE PRTM ABIES,
TUESDAY, FEBEUAEY 29TH.
Harry Hildredth, Jr., who is well and
favorably known to all the citizens of
Chicago, the peoples or the Democratic
candidate for the nomination for alder
man of the Second Ward, to be voted
for at the primaries Tuesday February
29th, was born in this city the latter
part of July, 1866 receiving his edu
cation in its public schools.
At the age of 16 years, he entered
the service, of Coxe Brothers and Com
pany, wholesale dealers in Coal, where
he remained for five years, working
his way on up to the position of car
accountant, later on resigning that po
sition to accept a more important
position with J. T. Bumey and Com
pany wholesale Coal dealers, faithfully
serving that company in various im
portant positions until 1890.
Then he severed his connection with
it to become cashier of the South Chi
cago Brewing Company which position
he held until he was appointed as as
sistant city treasurer of Chicago, by
City Treasurer Ernst Hummel, in the
spring of 1903.
As assistant city treasurer Mr. Hil-
dreth was a painstakingcity or public
official and was courteous in an emi
nent manner to all those whom he came
in contact with, honorably and faith
fully serving in that capacity under
city Treasurer John E. Traeger until
the spring of 1909.
Mr. Hildreth can point with pride
to the fact that his father James H.
Hildreth, was a member of the Chi
cago Board of Trade Battery and
fought in the Union Army from July
1, 1862 to July 1, 1865, and the di
vision which his father belonged to
had the honor of capturing Jefferson
Davis, the head chief of the Confeder
ate states.
For some years past Mr. Hildreth
has been the manager and one of the
owners of the Hotel .Warner, 33rd
street and Cottage Grove Ave., which
is one of the best and most home like
hotels in this city, as such he employs
many Colored people and treats them
with consideration, his head chef being
a Colored man who has been with him
for the past five years or long before
the idea had entered his mind to be
come a candidate for Alderman of the
Second Ward, many of the maids are
also Colored and they always look neat
and trim while in the discharge of
their duties and the Colored help in
the Hotel Warner speak of him in the
very highest terms claiming that he
is a dandy boss and a high class gen
tleman.
Mr. Hildreth left the city hall with
a reputation for honesty and truthful
ness which cannot bo surpassed any
where and his word is his bond in all
business transactions, being at all
times friendly disposed towards the
Colored people, and being willing to
give them a square deal at all times
he is justily entitled to receive a
healthy per cent of their votes and
support at the primaries in his race
for the nomination for alderman of
the Second Ward.
