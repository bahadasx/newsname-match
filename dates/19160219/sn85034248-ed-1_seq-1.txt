Seventeen years later the boy is a

Important to Young Voters.
DIistrict Attorney T. Arthur Ed
wards of Calcasieu parish has handed
down an opinion of interest to many
voters, concerning their right to vote
in the second primary and the gen
eral election in April. The question
affects those who became of age last
year, but did not pay a poll tax.
"Such a person can vote," declares
the district attorney, "if he is prop
erly registered and if he has paid his
poll tax for 1915. prqvided same has
been assessed a.a;inst him. If the
said poll tax has never been assessed
-against him, the p!il tax qualification
should not figure in his right to vote."
Persons who became of age in 1915
iand did not pay a pol tax should as
certain if one hay been assessed
against them. If not then they are
entitled to vote this spring, whereas
if one was assessed against them anti
they failed to pay it they are disqual
ified for two years.
A membership list for a Parker
club was circulated last week by

ganiz:ed effort being made to call on
all the voters. The Progressive-In

assured of a tiu vote not only in Don

Sam Bernard, the irrepressible king
of comedy, will make his first ap
pearance before the local motion
picture public at the Grand Theatre
next Monday, Feb. 21, in a 2o;ar
part film travesty entitled "Poor
Schmaltz." As the persecuted and
persistent wooer of an American
heiress, this famous comedian pre
sents one of the most humorous
spectacles ever seen on the screen.
It requires four hilarious reels to
complete "Poor Schmaltz's" distress
ing but excruciatingly funny adven
tures, and the humnor grows until one
is well-nigh exhausted with laughter.
"The Voice in the Fog" will be the
Friday attraction at the Grand. Don

notable production.
Elsie Janis in " 'Twas Ever Thus,"
a delightful photo comedy of the art
of love making from the prehistoric

Miss Janis impersonates three en
tirely different girls: a hare-limbed
belle of the cave dweller epoch, a re
fined daughter of the Boston aris
tocracy of 1865, and an up-to-the
minute New York novelist of the pres

first, her grace with the difficult

and charm as the third prove an in

WHY PRINCE ALBERT WINS.
Patented Process Is Responsible For
Its International Popularity,
Smokers so much appreciate the
flavor and coolness and aroma of
Prince Albert pipe and cigarette
tobacco that they often marvel that
this one brand could be so differ
ent from all others.
The answer to this question is
to be found on the reverse side of
every Prince Albert package, where
you will read: "Process Patented
July 30th, 1007," That tells the
whole story. Prince Albert is made
by a patented process that cuts out
the bite and parch, which makes the
tobacco so agreeable and satisfying
to men of every taste of every civil
ized nation on the globe.
Smokers should realize that this
patented process cost three years'
continuous work and study and a
fortune in money to perfect. But
the result has proven to be worth
all that was expended upon it, be
cause it has set free men who be
lieved they never could enjoy a pipe
or a "makin's" cigarette.
Prince Albert makes it possible
for every man to smoke a pipe or
to roll his own cigarettes. And, no
matter how tender the tongue, Prince
Albert cannot bite or parch. That
is cut out by the patented process,
leaving for the smoker only the joys
of the fragrant tobacco.
It is a fact that since Prince
Albert "arrived," just about six
years ago, it has made three men
smoke pipes where one smoked a pipe
before!

THE DEMOCRATIC PLATFORM.
Address to People of Louisiana By
State Central Committee.
Following is the full text of the re
port of the committee on resolutions
submitted at last week's meeting of
the Democratic state central commit
tee, and adopted by that body:
To the white people of Louisiana:
One hundred and fifteen thousand
white Democrats, comprising about
four-fifths of the white electorate of
the state, present to the people of
Louisiana, for their suffrage, the fol
lowing state ticket, nominated at the
Democratic primary held on January
25, last:
For governor, Ruffin G. Pleasant.
For lieutenant governor, Fernand
Mouton.
For secretary of state, James J.
Bailey.
For auditor of public accounts, Paul
Capdevielle.
For treasurer, Henry Hunsicker.
For attorney general, A. V. Coco.
For superintendent of public edu
cation, Thomas H. Harris.
For register of the state land office,
Fred J. Grace.
For commissioner of agriculture
and immigration, Harry D. Wilson,
The Democratic party enters into
this campaign with no apologies for
the past or demagogical promises for
the future, and stands squarely on
those principles advocated by its
nominee during the primary cam
paign. The leaders and the rank and
the file are the men who have weath
ered the storms of political, commer
cial, industrial and agricultural ad
versity; the men who have been stead
fast and loyal and by their brains and
brawn have built, on the wreck of the
civil war and reconstruction, a pros
perous and growing commonwealth;
the men who have, by devotion to
duty, freed the state of negro domina.
tion, which, since 1898, has never
been threatened. Under adverse cir
cumstances, handicaps and serious set
backs, that would have disheartened
men ma(le of weaker mould, the De
:ocracy of Louisiana has brought or
der out of chaos, and, through the
wise and enlightened efforts of suc
cessive Democratic administrations,
re-established our credit at home and
:broad, rebuilt and developed our ed
ucational and eleemosynary institu
t:ons, provided and maintained a
Gp'endid public schoolsystem, opened
our doors to capital. and aided and
encouraged our agricultural, indus
rial. commercial and mineral develop
ment.
The Democratic party is opposed to
any further centralizat$tn of power
in the hands of the govtinor, and is
therefore oppose o Shohrt ballot
terference in local i irs has always
been a cardinal pri ciple of Democ
racy. If the people of -a city desire
civil service in theilt municipality, it
should be a matter for them to de
cide and should not be thrust upon
!.hem by outsiders.
The fee system should be abolished
and officials placed upon a salary
basis, with due regard to efficiency of
public service, and a reasonable, fair
and just compensation for service per
formed.
We favor and demand such a rev.
sion of our judiciary system as will
effectually facilitate the more prompt
dispatch of court proceedings, and
eliminate untoward and unnecessary
delays incident to court procedure
and the final determination of litiga
tion.
As soon as practicable, the licenses
on all trades, occupations or profes
sions, that have a derivative right to
exist, should be abolished.
The Democratic party is opposed to
any increase in the present rate of
state taxation, and to meet the ordi
nary expenses of the government,
pledges itself to a proper equalization
of assessment and adjustment of the
burden of taxation. With a Demo
cratic legislature and a Democratic
executive, this will be accomplished
after careful and temperate consider
ation.
If, to settle the problem confront
ing uk today, or those that may arise
in th near future, it is found neces
sary call a constitutional conven
tion, it should be .giled with ample
time before the election of delegates,
for full discussion by the people of
the measures to be considered. It
should be a convention in which each
perish shall have its proportionate
share of representation, and the work
of such convention should be submit
ted to the people for ratification.
Capital should be encouraged and
protected in its rights; and labor
treated fairly and justly, with all of
its rights protected against abuses and
encroachments.
The artificial citizen, known as the
corporation, shoqld be made to obey
the law and so to live that it will deal
justly and honorably with the public.
The anti-trust laws and other crimi
nal and regulatory measures should be
vigorously applied to combinations of
capital and of persons that offend.
On the other hand, demagogical
prosecutions of corporations should
not be tolerated. They must be pro
tected in their rights as well as in
dividual citizens.
The building and maintaining of
better public highways, so successful
ly inaugurated and continued during
previous Democratic administrations,
should be prosecuted with zeal and
without abatement,
The only true permanent wealth is
production from the soil. Louisiana
is primarily an agricultural state. Her
greatest source of wealth is her
abundantly fertile and inexhaustible
lands. The depopulation of the land
is a recognized evil. To the end that
there may.be a revival of agricultur
al activity and prosperity, and a re
population of the land with an in
dustrious, conservative, and educated
citizenship the Democratic party
pledges its vigorous effort:
To provide every aid and encour
agement to the upbullding of agri
culture and husbandry in their Mfkani
fold departments; emphasizing par
ticularly live stock improvement, bet
ter market facilities, agricultural high
schools, experimental work and de
monstration and extension work
among the farmers.
And we recognize that the greatest
aid to the accomplishment of an agri
cultural revival, and a repopulation of
the lands, would be the establishment
of business facilities whereby the
farmers may obtain financial aid on
long terms at low interest, in other
words, a rural credit system.
All of our educational and elee
mosynary institutions should be pro
vided for as liberally as the state's
income will permit.
The Democratic party is unaltera
bly opposed to increasing the state
debt for any purpose whatsoever.
In order that all legitimate obliga
tions of the state may be met, all un
necessary offices and expenses should
be eliminated and the strictest econ
omy observed. Under no circum
stance should appropriations exceed
the revenues of the state; and to that
end a system of state budget should
be adopted.
The control of the flood waters of
the Mississippi river, and the levees
necessary to. protect the lowlands of
Louisiana from the waters of a con
tinent, is and should be the nation's
charge, as enunciated in the national
Democratic platform of 1912. But,
until the national government as
sumes the obligation, we advocate the
maintenance of the levee system by
the state to the highest degree of ef
ficiency.
We reaffirm our allegiance to the
Democratic party,. and we especially
send greetings to President Woodrow
Wilson, who has so ably and patrioti
cally preserved to our country the
blessings of peace amidst a world at.
war.
In this day of national stress, we
call upon the white Democrats of
Louisiana to turn a deaf ear to those
who would have them forswear the
faith of their fathers, and we urge up
on them the necessity of upholding
the banner of Democracy in ward and
parish, state and nation.
We appeal to the white electorate
to stand by the nominees of the
party. We appeal to their honor,
their judgment, and their patriotism,
with an abiding faith that this ap
peal will not be in vain.
MARRIED FIFTY YEARS.
Mr. and Mrs. Newsham CelI~ate Gol
den Wedding Anniversary.
Fromi St. Francisviile True-Democrat. Feb. 12
Today, February 12, 1916, is the
fiftieth anniversary of the marriage
of Mr. and Mrs. J, P, Newsham of St.
Francisville, By the request of Mrs.
Newsham, whose nerves are lately
grippe-racked, and who does not feel
tqd the entertiamen.t paf gafste
no social recognition of the .date is
made, but hosts of friends will give
the couple their warmest congratula
tions and good wishes that every hour
may be golden to them as they face
the radiance of the sunset. There may
be no gifts of gold showered upon
them, but if every kindly feeling to
them in their old age was l ssed in
eagles and guineas, then would
be rich indeed, A series o usiness
reverses has made inroads into their
worldly wealth, but a comfortable
competence remains, and every one
hopes ghat their purse may be full to
the end,
Fifty years ago they were married,
and the long years together have been
marked by the bereavements and sor
rows that mortals must expect through
such a lengthy period, but there has
been, and is, much happiness and
content. The pretty residence, which
is their home, is one of the most
attractive spots in the town, embower
ed as it is in flowers and vines, and
set amidst green velvet lawn. The
mistress of the house is the very
spirit of the flowers. She works among
them, and they spring up like magic
at her touch. Seeing her work among
her blossoms, one would never guess
the age, of which this golden anni
versary brings revealment. Mr. New
sham's head is white with the years'
crown of snow, but otherwise he does
not seem to be an old man. One
would never think of them as an
"aged couple,"
We .have been shown one of the
wedding invitations that served for
the happy occasion fifty years ago. It
is quaint but elegant, this old-time
wedding card. It is 5 inches by 2%
and in very fine engraved scrip says
that "Mrs. E. Weber would be pleased
to have you present at the Marriage
of her Daughter, Louisa, with J. P.
Newsham, in the' Catholic Church at
Donaldsonville, Monday, Feb. 12, at
5 .% o'clock P. M." Accompanying the
card are the visiting cards of the
bridal pair, tied together. Reverend
Father Boglioli, who performed the
ceremony, and the loving mother who
gave her only daughter in marriage
have passed from earth. The only
son, the lamented Edward L. New
sham, the only child of this marriage,
is also gone away to that other world,
whose simplest opportunities are bet
ter than the brightest on earth. There
are five grandchildren, Jos. P., Jr.,
Edward L., Dewey, Preston and Miss
Mimie Newsham, of Baton Rouge.
The couple, united in 1866, survive
to show that however heavy life's
trials may be God gives compensation,
and that life itself is sweet in the
sun, and hope and love have a touch,
like that of Midas, to turn all the
years-to gold.
Negro Coach Plea Passed.
The Louisiana Railroad Commission
has postponed indefinitely the hearing
on the case which was brought against
the Louisiana railroads to compel
them to provide separate toilets for
the sexes and separate smoking com
partments in negro coaches. The case
was scheduled for hearing at the com
mission's session to be held in Baton
Rouge Feb. 15, but the postponement
was granted at the request of rail
road officials who said they would be
unable to attend the session because
of preparations they were making to

VOTES FOR WOMEN.
Southern States Woman Suffrage
Conference.
417 Camp Street, New Orleans.
Cupid Enlisted.
Did you get a suffrage valentine?
Some of the simon-pure poets wrote
odes, verses .and other sugary stuff
whereby to embellish valentines for
New York suffragists. These were
sent to congressmen and the tender
sentiments indicated the genuine love
the women feel toward the ballot.
Seems like a real womanly way to
campaign for enfranchisement, but if
this proves ineffective, what's the mat
ter with the old, historical method of
demanding justice? When autocrats
refuse, only cowards submit. Who
wants a slavish motherhood to trans
mit a cringing nature to our sons?
Hail to the' suffrage valentine, there-1
fore, and may it bring the protecting
ballot-box nearer the home!
Legislators Dumb.
It doesn't often happen, that's why
the fact is chronicled. The customary
procedure for legislators is to agitate
vocally until the atrqosphere is caloric.
This method of heating is more ex
pensive than steam pipes or registers,
but it is usually more incessant.
That's its virtue. However, the vocal
hot-air siupply failed the members of
the Kentucky committee in the pres
ence of the women who pleaded for
the ballot. Four of the Kentucky
legislators promptly voted "yes," but
five of the representatives were mute.
The women's arguments struck them
dumb. They were all Democrats, too,
and perhaps the flood-gates of their
oratory will not be opened until the
national Democratic convention rises
.o the demands of true democracy in
which women are counted people.
then straightway those five repre
sentatives will speak as one man and
the exultant shout of party release
will be "Votes for Women."
What's the Use?
Some entbusiastic member of the
New York" egislature has int.,,duced
a bil, to provide a suffrage referen-I
dum n'or the women of that state
This is to enable the women them
relves to indicate whether a majority
really want the ballot. The last
election permitted the men to say if
men want women to yote. Now the
purpose is to find out if women want
women to vote. See the difference?
But what's the use? If the majority
voted overwhelmingly in favor, it
wouldn't give the l b.lt t to New York
.i hinen any r~nre .t ~a :itraw vote'
elects the governor of the state. This]
plan was tried in Massachusetts and
New York some years ago. The suf
fragists numbered twenty to one in
New York, and in Massachusetts
twenty-five women were in favor to
one against. But the result was nil.
Until the ballot is a constitutional
right, the women's votes are illegal
and ean merely sentimental expr e
sion about as effective in real legis
lation as poetry, moonbeams and as
trology. -
A Severe Cold Quickly Cured.
"On December first I had a very
severe cold or attack of the grip as it
may be, and was nearly down sick in
bed," writes O. J. Metcalf, Weather
by, Mo. "I bought two bottles of
Chamberlain's Cough Remedy and it
was only a few days until I was com
pletely restored to health. I firmly
believe that Chamberlain's Cough
Remedy is one of the very best medi
cines and will know what to do when
I have another cold." Obtainable

WHY MEN ARE BALD.
Prominent Chicago Physician Gives
Reason For Loss of Hair.
In the February American Maga
zine Dr. Arthur R. Reynolds. former
health commissioner of Chicago, gives
the following reason for baldness:
"The hats that men wear are the
cause of their baldness above the hat
line. Women also wear hats, but
their hats are fastened to their hair
and do not grip the head as men's hats
do. All other causes of baldness
such as infections, seborrhea, etc.,
affect both sexes alike and are, iu
fact, more difficult to treat locally in
women than in men because of their
long hair.
"How does the hat affect the
growth of hair in man? By compress
ing the arteries, the veins, the lym
phatics, and to some extent the nerves
that supply and nourish the hair. It
is not because the hat is hard or soft
or that it keeps the head too hot. It
is because the hat band compresses
the vessels and starves the roots of
the hair. Caps may do the same
thing, but caps as a rule do not grip
the head so tightly as hats do.
"Baldness usually begins at the
summit of the crown toward the back
part, at the distant and weaker part
of the vessels furnishing the circula
tion. In such cases the pressure has
been on the vessels on the side of the
head. Sometimes the baldness begins
above the forehead and is the high
forehead type of hbaldness. In these
cases the pressure has been upon the
vessels of the forehead. Sometimes
the head is bald low down in the back
where the pressure has been upon the
vessels in this region. When the head
is completely bald on top the pressure
has been on the entire vascular sup
ply of the scalp."

We extract the following item from
the Hope Villa correspondence if the
Baton Rouge State-Times of Feb. 11,
and join in extending assurances of
profound sympathy to the stricken

"The untimely death of Mrs. I. L.
Odom came as a sad shock to a wide
circle of friends and relatives in this
community as well as in Baton Rouge.
Every hope was held for her life un
til Monday morning, Feb. 7, when she
quietly passed away. The interment
took place at the Oak Grove Baptist

Rouge performing the last rites. Mrs.
Odom was an ardent church and

friends is extended to the bereaved
husband and family."
