A Safety First Sermon
The following article taken from Roy
K. Moulton's column of the Grand
Rapids News is a very pointed illus
tration of the cause of the great fire
waste of this and other states.
. -j v
A Safety First Sermon that is going
the'rounds:
WHO AM I?
I am more powerful than the com
bined armies of the world.
I am more deadly than bullets, and
I have wrecked more homes than the
mightiest of siege guns.
I steal in the United States alone over
$300,000,000 each year.
I spare no one, and find my victims
among the rich and poor alike; the
young and the old; the strong and the
weak; widows and orphans know me.
I massacre thousands upon thousands
of wage-earners in a year. '
I lurk in unseen places, and 'do most
of my work silently. You are warned
against me, but you heed not.
I am relentless. I am everywhere;
in the home, on the street, in the fac
tory, at railroad crossings and on the
sea.
I bring sickness, degradation and
death, and yet few seek to avoid me.
I ,l..4. i. i : t
f i ucauuy, ci uaii aim maun; i give
(notning, but take all.
I am your worst enemy.
I AM CARELESSNESS.
WILSONIAN COrsCEIT.
For concentrated quintessence of
conceit it would be impossible to find
anything surpassing the remark of
President Wilson in his New York
speech before the Railroad Business
Association, in which he said.
"We must all of us think, from this
time out, in terms of the world, and
must learn what it is that America has
set out to maintain as a standard-bearer
for all those who love liberty and
justice and the righteousness of politi
cal action."
"From this time out!" Heretofore
we have not thought in terms of the
world. Hitherto we have not known
what it is that America has set out to
maintain. We have beeh drifting in
darkness without captains and without
compasr.es. "From this time out,"
however, we are to be guided by the
latest rleclaration of truth from that
man, who, of all men prominent in
American history, has been unrivaled
in cfynges of mind, vacillation of pur
pose, Mid uncertainty of action. "From
this time out,." we are to be guided by
new ideals as to liberty and justice.
That is, wo shall be so guided until Mr.
WilsoijVgain changes Jus mind and
marks fcyt for us a new path which we
must foyCAt ;if we would truly know
what it is that America has set out to
maintain.
Poor deluded Washington, short
sighted JeffeVson, mis-guided Monroe,
apless Lincoln, thoughtless McKinley!
what a pity you lived before it was
possible to "learn what it is that Amer
ica has set out to maintain as a standard-bearer
for all those who love liber
ty and justice and the righteousness of
political action!"
COMMISSIONER II ELM E
EXPOSES "CURE-ALL
"Tanlac Proves to be Concoc
tion of Tonics and Alcohol.
A new panacea for the cure of "all
ailments of the stomach kidneys and
liver, catarrhal affections of the mucous
membranes, rheumatism, nervous dis
orders and the like" is offered to the
public under the name of Tanlac. The
label on the bottle neatly avoids
the pure drugs act by claiming to be
only a "tonic and system purifier.
An analysis of Tanlac in the labora
tory of this Department shows the fol
lowing: Alcohol 1G.4 per cent
Glycerine 2.0 per cent
Licorice Present
Aloes or Cascara Present
Gentian Present
Alkaloids 'Berberine Trace
The presence of a trace of tartaric
acid shows that wine is the base of this
medicine. The 1G percent alcohol gives
it the "kick" that makes a fellow feel
good and ought to fill a long felt want
in "Dry Counties.' Aloes is a laxative.
Gentian is a bitter drug, a so-called
tonic. If the reader wants to be cured
by the Tanlac route at one-fourth the
expense, let him get a quart bottle of
good sherry wine. Then go to the local
druggist and get )i druhms of Gly
cerine and two drahms each of Aloes,
Gentian, Licorice and Cascara. Mix
(if you wish) and you will have Tanlac
so near that neither you nor the manu
facturer can tell the difference. This
formula will give four times the quanti
ty found in an ordinary $1 bottle of Tan
lac. We say, "mix if you wish." For
our part we dislike to spoil a good bot
tle of wine by mixing it with bitter
drugs like Aloes and Gentian. Our
personal advice to all desiring to try
this panacea would be to drink the
bottle of wine and give the drugs to the
hired girl.

SOCIAL CENTERS
Supt. of Public Instruction Urges
WideV Use of School Building.
We have entertained the idea that
the schoolhouse exists only for the
child. No effort has been made to
bring the people of the community to
gether. Willi the passing of the husk
ing bee and spelling school, has gone ai
common- -interest essential to the
highest type of citizenship. The schools
have suffered because of the absence
of this common interest. . With the
exception of a few cities, the school
buildings are open but a few hours
each day and about three-fourths of the
year. There could be no criticism if
the school has fulfilled its mission
when it has served as a place for giving
the child his academic education. A
small village located in the northern
part of the state and organized less
than two years ago is a fine example of
a community where the schoolhouse is
used as a social center. There was no
other building where the social activi
ties of the community could be held so
the very necessity of the situation caub
ed these people to discover the value
of the schoolhouse as a social center. If
it is possible to throw open a school
building to the public in a new coun
try, it is possible everywhere.
The school building should serve as a
meeting place for all organfzations of
the community that have an educational
value and as a place for discussing
topics which are of interest to the com
munity. Such meetings will produce
better schools and better civic condi
tions. One of the purposes of our
schools is to train for democracy. They
are not doing this unless they serve as
a place for training our people how to
live and work together.
And Along Came Ruth
"Oh, these dratted stamps!" angrily
exclaimed Ruth's father, as he took a
small lot of them out of his pocket,
"every one of them stuck to another
one! I should have known better than
to fold 'em up like that!"
"I can fix them for you," said Ruth.
And taking a hut flat iron from the
stove, she placed the stamps upon an
ironing board, put a piece of thin paper
over them and ironed them for a
minute. Then when she lifted the
paper, the stamps were found to be
easy to pull apart, and the gum was not
disturbed in the least. ,
Ruth's father looked his admiration
at her, but said nothing. But his smile
paid Ruth for her trouble.

TUBERCULOSIS WEEK
Schools of Michigan to Take
Active Part in the Campaign.
The week beginning March Gth has
nceh designated Tuberculosis Week in
the schools of Michigan by the Super
intendent of Public Instruction. Teach
ers of both public and parochial schools
are asked to co-operate in carrying out
the work. This is an anti-tuberculosis
year in' Michigan. An appropriation
of $100,000 is being expended in a cam
paign against the disease. 2500 peo
ple die every year in Michigan, and
150,000 in the United' States, from tu
berculosis alone. Physicians estimate
that from 75 to 90 per cent of all peo
ple become infected, with it at some
time in their lives. The disease is re
sisted or overcome through correct liv
ing habits. The school's part in eradi
cating the disease is mainly along the
line of prevention to train the boys
and girls in health habits. The twenty
thousand school teachers in Michigan
are in a great measure responsible for
the health and habits of the half a
million boys and girls enrolled in the
schools. The teacher must in many
cases do what the homes fail to do.
Boys and girls should come from the
schools good sfrong physical beings be
cause of the knowledge gained and the
health habits formed. The five, hun
dred thousand school children in Mich
igan will do much in educating the
homes and bringing about proper con
ditions. The State Superintendent has
outlined a series of lessons for the
week beginning March G and has pub
lished a bulletin for the use of teachers ,
in presenting the work. These bulle-1
tins have been forwarded to commis-1
sioneis and superintendents for distri-1
bution to teachers. Lessons are given
on the following subjects:
Fresh Air and How to Get it, Food
and Proper Eating Habits, Rest and
Exercise, Cleanliness and What it Will
do for You, Clothing and Dress.
Health is emphasized in the bulletin
rather than disease. Round shoulders
and sunken chests and incorrect sitting
and standing habits are to receive
attention. Corrective exercises are to
be made a part of the school work.
Such vital questions as how to breathe
the necessity for fresh air and sunlight,
what to cat and how to eat, the'need of
sufficient sleep and rest, the relation
of cleanliness to health, sensible cloth
ing, are to be made the basis of the
week's work. Teachers can make this
series of five lessons the most impor
tant series of lessons of the year's work.
The subject is a live one. Practice is
the nly thing that counts. Rules
alone will never preserve health nor
assist in regaining it. School boards
can do more in the prevention of tuber
culosis along the line of providing pro
per physical conditions regarding heat
ing, ventilation, sunlight, seating, etc.,
than can be accomplished by the same
amount of money expended in other
ways. The friends of tuberculosis are:
dampness, dirt, darkness, intemper
ance, mouth breathing. The enemies
of tuberculosis are: sunlight, fresh air,
good food, cleanliness, full breathing.
The bulletin includes a message from
Governor W. N. Ferris to the schools.

"OBSERVER' OFFERS
ADVICE TO BOYS
(By "Observer.")
Because the boy of twelve to eigh
teen years is inexperieneed, he does
not welcome advice, and if he knew
who I am, he probably would form his
opinion of me at once that I am an old
fossil "butting" into other people's
business. However, I am gofng to
give him some advice in this article. If
he accepts it, sometime, perhaps, he
will remember the name of your pap
er and thank me for it. If he doesn't
accept it, the loss is his.
The boy who is noisy and impolite
on the streets is making a mistake in
being so. He may work himself up to
a position of high standing among his
companions he may become the
"bully of the bunch," but that position
is not worth striving for. In fact, it is
one to be avoided.
The business men of the town are
watching you, young man, and it is to
your interest, more by far, to court
their esteem than that of your pals.
You are growing into manhood, rapid
ly. Soon you will be wanting employ
ment. Your conduct today determines
your chances of the future.
If we could read their minds, there
are no doubt several business men in
town this very day who are needing a
boy and who are wondering what boy
in town is worthy of his trust. You
may be too young for the position, now
but such opportunities always will be'
open. It remains only for you to guard
your character and reputation that
men muy have confidence in you when
your time comes. Men like a gentle-
manly boy.
You don't need to be a
"sissy," but you must not be rude,
Have all the fun you want, but make
sure that your ideas of fun are not
offensive to someone else. Try to keep
: always in mind that you are a boy and
that older people really do know what
iw best. Respect their desires, acquire
all the education you can get, and your
opportunity will come.

THRIFT IN THE HOME
Thrift is good management, and no
where is good management more mani
fest than in the home. You can soon
tell what manner . of housekeeper the
wife is, for the impress of her ideals
and ideas is on every hand. She can
waste all the husband earns, or she can
save the major part.
Housekeeping is the most complicated
work in the world, and she who can
keep a house well is a good business
woman. She can make her work drudg
ery or she can make it a pleasure. Men
' fail in business and the world knows it;
but how many home failures there are
of which the world never hears! '
i It is easy to -detect the woman who
fails as a houskeeper. If you see the
dishes unwashed, the children unkept,
clothes strung all over the house, the
bath littered, the corners dirty and a
general air of neglect, you may depend
upon it she has failed as a business
housekeeper. She does not know how.
Writing in the Ladies'llome Journal,
j one woman tells how she succeeds as a
j homemaker and as a business woman
in the home. She aims at simplicity.
She has simple furnishings, but good.
She has no "parlor" that abomination
t of olden time, but a living room, where
they really live. Most parlors are
merely to look at, not to use. She has
simple meals things 'they are all stuck
' on,' as her little boy puts it, but lots of
them. Baked beans only, but lots of
them and good. And who couldn't
make a meal on the beans mother used
to bake?
She has no curtains at the windows;
her windows are for light and air, not
to display curtains and catch the dust
and keep out the sunlight. She wastes
no food. She allows the children to
take only as much as they can eat and
no more. If they leave any food on
j the plate, the next meal begins with
I that cold plate! Her garbage pail is for
waste, not food. "Swell swill" costs
money, and "pigs is pigs" and relish
potato peelings as much as ice cream,
j She doesn't make her attic a junk
shop. She makes it a storeroom; cleans
it once a year, but that is all. She has
. order in the kitchen. She saves time
by having things in order. She doesnt
dry her dishes, but "scalds" them and
lets them dry themselves and they can
do it, better than she.
She uses a "letter press" to "iron"
socks and towels and coarse articles
that other women break their backs
over to no useful purpose.
A fireless cooker saves gas and time
and food. She keeps biscuit flour
mixed with the proper proportion of
salt and baking powder and biscuits
for her oven in five minutes! She has
all her kitchen utensils handy, cans
and receptacles labeled, and thus she
saves ateps. Some women walk too
much on their jobs. She always has
change in the house, runs no accounts,
pays cash on delivery, weighs her pur
chases and takes nothing for granted.
She keeps account of all of her expendi
tures and knows where her money
goes and what it buys. She doesn't
hire much help, because she doesn't
need it. She studies her job and suc
ceeds because she knows how.
Wise and Otherwise
All married women travel under an
assumed name.
It is reported on good authority that
the dove of peace is nesting with the
eagles.
When a young man gets to going too
fast he begins to lag behind his slower
and soberer brothers.
No matter how much we may be op
posed to woman's suffrage, there are
worse things for instance, the army of
male voters who do not go to the polls.
Hints Worth Trying
To prevent "runs" in new silk stock
ings stitch with thread around leg of
the new stockings a short distance from
the top one can prevent the dropped
thread that so often ruins a new pair of
stockings. The stitching should be
done on the sewing machine with a
very fine stitch.
To cut fresh bread Dip your knife
in boiling water and you can cut the
thinnest slice from a fresh loaf.
Hot water plates for invalids for
serving food are now on sale in this
country. The plate is really an orna
mental pan with handles for lifting,
and a spout foffilling with hot water.
Inside is fitted a serving plate for the
food which has the temperature sus
tained by the heat from beneath. Pri
ces vary according to material and size.
