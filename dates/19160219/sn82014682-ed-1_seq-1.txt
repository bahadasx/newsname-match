BiH Bapidly Advancing in Con

? Youngsters From Working

prohibits Interstate
COMMERCE IN PRODUCTS
Question Was Up at Two Ses
sions of Hawaiian Legisla
ture; Pineapple Men Showed
Local Work Was Light-
Child-labor legislation' already well-
advanced In Congress, promises within
a few months to affect to an important
extent the big and growing industry of
pineapple canning in Hawaii.
- In addition to the pineapple can
neries. several other less important in
dustries will be affected. In tact, the
bill which la now advancing steadily
through Congress with every prospect
of becoming & law, has many posslblli
ties of far-reaching effect Under its
terms even the child makers of leis
might come -wKhin the Tan.. "
The bill la H. R. S234 and is de
signed to prevent interstate commerce
in products on vrhlch children labor,
Jts substance la in the following para
graph, which li a part of the-meaaure
aa it passed the House of Representa
lives on February 2; -;
v "That no producer, manufacturer,
or dealer shall ahlp or deliver for ship
ment in Interstate commerce the pro
duct of any mine or euarry situated in
the United CUtes which has been pro
duced, In whole or in part, by the J
bor of children under the age of 15
years, or the product of any mill, can-
nrvr workancp, factory, or manurao
turlng estabiUhment situated in the
United etatea which has. been pro
duced, In whole or In part, by the la
.bor of children? under the age of 14
year or by. the labor f children be
tween the ages of 14. years and 16
years who work more than efght hours
In any one dy, cr mora than al days
in any oni wiik, or after the hour of
7 o'clock, p-tflV or before ;the-etf
7 o'clock. m.T'---' - ..-i''i..'f ." ' v..-'
..', The bill is now In the senate, -and
a.ccordbg to latest advices, stands an
excellent cl.irc cf soon being report
ed out of committee favorably and of
passage by the senate.
The Question of child labor In -the
canneries has been before the Hawaii
an legislature at the last two sessions.
' At ; both T' sessions pineapple men
, showed that 'ihe work done by the
many youngsters during the .rush can
ning season was light, and the legisla
ture saw no necessity then of passing
a law along lines similar to that pro
posed for national child-labor legisla
tion. -- .: :'-;W'v-:r)v.
But .eren during the session of the
last legislature, warning was given
that legislation by Congress might re
sult in the same effect as would be ac
complished by territorial law. The
large -interstate trade of .the, pineap
ple men cannot be carried on unless
they observe the national law, it was
declared at a house hearing by Attor
ney R. W. Breckons. 7 . . . '
It was stated unofficially by pineap
ple men prior to the last session of
the legislature that thev would not ob
ject to child-labor ' legislation which
would safeguard the children in Ha-,
'wall and yet would allow these chil
dren to do a reasonable amount of
healthful work under sanitary condi
tions. It was pointed out also that In
many cases the cannera gave employ
ment to very , poor children who thus
were enabled materially to help their
families. : ' : ." ' v
