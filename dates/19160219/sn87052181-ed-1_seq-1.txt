(J C ,
NCE again, ns tho anniver
sary of his birthdny rolls
around, wo contomplate
tho life and accomplish
ments of our nation's fa
ther. Tho United States
of America is now in tho ,
midst of a great crisis ono ot threo.
Tho llrst was tho desperato strugglo
of thq baby republic to maintain llfo
botween 1776 and 1815. Tho second
was the terrific fever which rattled tho
bones .of tha half-grown Viation fronr
1SGI to 1805. Tho third Is different.
Tho hungry, blood-mad wolves of
war aro snarling all about us. Wo aro
charged with tho problem of taking
means of defensu against tho time
when they may turn from their car
casses to attack us. Wo must insure
for ourselves prosperity. For tho good
of tho whole wo must assumo tho task
of harmonizing all tho multltudo
of discordant nnd misunderstanding
groups of peoplo that compose our
body politic men nnd women of a
great variety of racial antecedents, of
political tenets, of religious beliefs, of
capital and labor, of education and
.Ignorance and weld them Into ono
great patriotic mass. Wo must keep
friendship with rur neighbors to North
and South and across tho seas.
So In this timo ot stress it behooves
us to keep our national temper and
deal fairly and mean what we say. It
is well worth whllo to consider tho
historian Lecky's description of Georgo
Washington:
"In tho despondency of long contin
ued failure, in tho elation of sudden
success, at times when his soldiers
wero dosertlng by hundreds, nnd when
malignant plots were formed against
his reputation, amid the constant quar
rels, rivalries, and Jealousies of his
subordinates, in tho dark hour ot na
tional Ingratitude, nnd In tho midst
of tho most universal and intoxicating
llnttery, Washington was always the
samo calm, wise, JU3t and slnglo-mlnd-
ed man, pursuing tho course which ho
believed t& bo right without fear or
favor or fanaticism; equally free from
tho passions that spring from interest
and from the passions that spring from
imagination.
"Ho novor acted on tho Impulse of
an absorbing or uncalculatlng en
thusiasm. and ho valued very highly
fortune, position, and reputation; but
at the command ot duty ho was ready
to risk and sacrifice them all
"Ho was, In tho highest sense of
tho words, a gontleman and n man ot
honor, and ho carried Into public life
tho standard of prlvato morals.
"It was at first tho constant droad
of largo sections ot tho American peo
plo that if the old government were
overthrown they would fall Into the
hands of military adventurers and un
dorgo tho yoko of military despotism.
It was mainly tho transparent Integ
rity of the character of Washington
that dispelled tho fear.1
Tboro has rarely been a time when
tho people had moro need of tho les
sons of Washington's llfo than now.
Wo aro In tho midst of tho uncertnln
ties visited upon us, ns a people at
peace, by a conflagration which has en
voloped a continent in war. In a year
ot peace, of sowing and reaping, of
tho productive activities ot market and
factory, wo suddenly found ourselves
faco to face with the peril ot such a
panic as tho world had never wit
nessed. Industry withered aa undor a
blight; trade dried up at tho roots;
our chief export crop lost for a timo
two-thirds of its valuo: specie pay
ments were suspended in our financial
centers. Instead of having heavy trade
balances in our favor, wo wero called
upon for gold by the ton to pay for se.
curltles sent back to us by foreign In
vestors. Want and destitution ap
pearcd whero there had been plenty.
Wo have como far slnco thoso black
days, but a dangerous road still
stretches beforo us. Let us remember
Washington, tho commnndor in chief
of ono battle.
That was Yorktown. Washington
took tho command of tho armies of
tho colonics in July, 1775. Ho rcceivod
tho surrender ot Cornwnllls In Octo
ber, 1781, moro than six years later.
Thoso six years wero spent in avoid
ing battle. There wns ono brilliant
sortlo tho battle of Trenton. But tho
history of his campaigns Is tho his

followed Trenton, rear-guard actions

with the duties of a.soldier requires
time. To brina them under nrcmer
j discipline and subordination not only requires
Oi time but is a work of great difficulty and in
this country, where there is so little distinc
tion between the officers and soldiers, re
quires an uncommon degree of attention.
To expect the same service from raw and
undisciplined recruits as from the veteran
soldiers is to expect what never did and per
haps never will happen. Washington,
attack. Thu siege of Yorktown was
a splendid thing but tho real test
came at Valley Forgo. When at last
tho hour came to fight, fighting was
easy by comparison with tho waiting
that had preceded it.
On July 2, 1775, Gcnoral Washing
ton nrrlved at Cambridge, Mass., ac
companied by Major General Leo, his
next in command, nnd other officers,
nnd established headquarters In tho
mansion subsequently occupied by
Longfellow. About nlno o'clock on
tho morning of the following day, at
tended by a suitable oscort, ho pro
ceeded from his headquarters to a
great elm tree near Harvard collego.
Hero tho Continental forces wero
drawn up in military order. Under
tho shadow of tho tree Washington
drew hiB sword as commander in chief
of tho American army, declaring that
it should nover bo shenthed until tho
liberties of his country were estab
lished. Finally tho day camo for Washing
ton to tako leave of his army October
18, 1783. For tho last time ho assem
bled them nt Newburgh. N. Y when
ho rodo out) on tho field and gavo them
ono ot thoso paternal addresses which
so eminently characterized his rela
tionship with his array.
But his final leavo of overythlng con
nected with his military llfo was takou
on December 3, 1781, at Fauncca' tav
ern, Now York city. Hero ho had re
quested his officers In full uniform to
assemble. On entering tho room nnd
finding himself surrounded by his old
companions In arms his agitated feel

Every man aroso with eyes turned
toward him. Filling n glass of wlno
and lifting It to his lips, ho rested his
bonlguant but saddened countenance
upon them nnd said- '
"With a heart full ot lovo and grati

A profound silence followed as tho
officers gazed at tho countonanco of
their leader, whilo the eyes of nil were
wet with tears. He then expressed
ngaln his desire that each ot them
should como and tako his hand.
Ono after anothor followed, receiv
ing and returning tho affcctlonato
adieu of their commander, after which,
ho left the room in silence, followed
by his officers in procession to em
bark in the barge that was to convey
him to Paulus Hook, now Jersey City.
As tie was passing through tho light
infantry, drawn up on either sldo to
recelvo him, an old soldier who was
by his side on the terrible night ot
his march to Trenton, stepped out ot
tho ranks and reached out his arms,
exclaiming: "Farewell, my dear gen
oral, fnrowoll!" Washington seized
his hand most heartily, when tho sol
diers forgot all discipline, rushed
toward their chief and bathed htm with
their tears. Tho scene was llko that
of a good patriarch taking loavo of
,hls children nnd going on a long Jour
ney whuueo ho might return no moro.
Having entered tho barge, ho turned
to tho weeping company upon tho
wharf and, waving his hat, bade them
a sllont adieu. They stood with heads
uncovcrod until tho bargo was hidden
from tholr view, when. In silent and
solemn procession, thoy returned to
tho place whero they had assembled.
