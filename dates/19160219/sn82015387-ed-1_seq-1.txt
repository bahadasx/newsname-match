After a survey of the agricultural

the writer has come to the conclu
alon that one, if not the greatest,
possibility that awaits -us is that of
the live stock industry. And the
. post profitable and safest money
crops that we can grow are the right
kinds of forage crops, marketed
through cattle and hogs. Of course,
we do not mean that other crops
ahould be neglected, but only that
the live stock industry, with the
special view of economical food pro
duction, should be made the basis
of our agricuttural development.
However, there are four things es
sentially necessary to be done before
we can expect to put ,the live stock
Iadustry on the most profitable basis.
and they are:
1. The importation of more pure
bred stock, at least to the extent of
having every hprd headed by, a pure
bred, male.
2. The eradication of the tick in
the cattle industry and the elimina
tion or prevention of cholera in the
swine industry.

Mr. Jas. Mullally appeared before
the police jury as a Lommittee of
one from the Covington Fire De

for an appropriation of $5.00 a
month to be paid night watchman

It was moved by J. B. Howze ana
seconded by Winm. Bruhl that above
appropriation be refused.

Prof. C. W. Price, of the Bun Con

crops, specially adapted to securing
a rotation for grazing throughout the
year.
4. Better and more systematic
marketing to be secured through or
ganization and co-ope;ation.
With these ideas in view, the
writer has secured the services of
two specialists of the Live Stock Ex

U. S. Department of Agriculture, Mr.
J. W. Perkins, forage crop special

specialist, to make a two-days speak

also very probable that we will have
with us a representative of the State

cuss the cure and prevention of live
stock diseases. These men are ex
perts in their respective lines, w-hose
services are in demand throughout
the State, and we think that we are,
quite fortunate in securing them.

the farmers, to attend these meet

NELSON SHARP TELlS WHAT
HE LEARNED BY BEING MEMBER
OF PARISH BOYS' CORN CLUB
Lectures He Heard at L. S.
U. and Lessons Learned
In Corn - Growing,
Chicken Raising.
When I Joined the Boys' Corn Club
in January, 1914, I did so with the
determinatioi to learn something
about corn growing. I learned many
valuable points the frat season, but
due to poor seasons I did not make
much of a record. But the points I
had learned from my study and ex
perience and from Mr. Lewis I was
determined to make good use of in
1915.
My acre of land was common pine
upland with red clay subsoil. Mr.
Lewis and I walked over the acre
after it had been well' broken with
turn-plow and the formula for my
fertilizers were written out. Mr.
Lewis made clear to me why this
particular formula was needed on
this particular acre of ilad. These
instructions were carried out as well
as other instructions given from time
to time.
I planted good seed and will plant
same kind- of noU this season
Calhoun's Red Cob.
Eadh visit Mr. Lewis paid me I
took him through my corn, and I
always listened attentively -to what
he had to say, as I wanted to learn
all I could in corn growing, and I
iwas very, very anxious to win the
free scholarship to L. S. U. offered
by the Covington Bank- & Trust Co.
I followed all instructions; I read
all my corn literature sent to me
each week; I worked my corn as it
needed to be worked, and I made
75 1-2 bushels on my acre. I had
a grand exhibit at our parish fair
and won some valuable prizes.' I
won the free scholarship to L. 9. U.
asid the many, many vailuable- es
sons I learned there during my two
weeks stay is worth a year's hard
work. Each morning we went to the
chemistry building and listened to
lectures on English by Dr. Blain.
After this we listened to lectures
by Prof. J. L. Heirs. He taught us
how to select good seed corn, how

plete. We understand the plans
practically give Are protection tc
every house in Covington, with the
use of the hose of the fire depart
ment. It would be well for those
who wish accurate and definite in
formation so as to get a knowledge
of the entire system, to inspect the
plans when they are placed in the
mayor's omce. The plant will be
municipally owned and operated.
.Many of those who opposed the
sewer system have announced them
selves in favor of the waterworks,
and it is espe-ted that when the
question is put before the people it
will carry.
to detect good stalks from bad, fer
tilisers needed on different types of
soil, and. many other points on corn
growing.
Mr. E. O. Edson lectured on poul
try. I did not know there was so
much to be learned in the poultry
business, till now I was shown how
to judge a chicken, an egg, and how
to make up different feeds for chick
ens at different stages. I thought
the samed-eed would do for a laying
hen that I feed to growing chickens.
I know better now. I learned other
points that will stay with me:
Prof. P. L. Guitbeau lectured on
forage crops; best kind, how to grow
and care for same. Best feeds for
animals, and soils suited for growing
same. These lectures were worth
gold to me. I listened to so many
lectures they all cannot be put in
this letter.
Each afternoon we visited some
part of the town. There were 200
of us, all corn winners from different
parts of the state.- We visited the
capitol building and went through
it. We visited the deaf and dumb
school and saw'some of the good
work being done by the boys anad
1girls. They reminded me Of a efwd
of people waving good bye to
'friend, when they all were talki
with their hands. We visited .l
school for the blind and saw the
blind children playing bail and do
lug other kfinds of work much better
than many people can do who can
see. I saw and learned so much that
I do not know how to tell it all, but
the .main points about corn growing
I have learned are:'
1. Establishing a good crop rota
tion.
2. Preparing a good seed bed.
3. Use all barn lot fertilizer and
commercial fertilizer to suit .condi
tions.
4. Do not plow or cultivate too
deep where corn is growing.
5. Do not go in corn with turn
plow.
6. Select your seed corn in the
fields.
In conclusion * wish to thank Mr.
Lewis for encouraging me and as
sisting me in every way posasible,
and to him I give much.of the credit
for my having won the scholarship
so kindly offered by the Covington
Bank & Trust Company.
