SWISS NATION IS
ON SOUND BASIS
President Declares Recent
Border Agitation Will Have
No Effect on Unity of
Switzerland.
Paris, Feb. 19, 4:55 a, m Camllle
de Coppot, president of the Swiss Fed
eration, says that there Is no crisis
In Switzerland Involving tho political
unity of the country, according to the
Berne correspondent of the Journal,
with whom M. de Coppot discussed
the agitation aroused In Switzerland
bv the disclosures made during In
stigation of the case against two
Swiss colonels arrested on charges of
communication of military secrets.
"Switzerland tomorrow will bo the
same as Switzerland of yesterday,"
said the president. "The sympathies
entertained by the Swiss for foreign
causes simply show that they are
using fully their constitutional liberty
to think as they like. Should a move
ment of assimilation take place on
cur borders it will be a movement of
endosmosis, as we say In physics,
rather than of exosmosis. In other
words, our neighbors are far more
likely to become Swiss than are tho
Swiss to enter into tho life of the bel
ligerent nations. All this popular
effervescence will quiet down when
the federal council meets. Everything
will be cleared up and Swiss patriot
ism will come out of the affair
strengthened if anything."
A dispatch from Geneva on Janu
ary 11 last said that Colonels de Wat
tenwyi and Egli had been accused of
communicating to German informa
tion regarding French positions along
the Swiss frontier and, according to'
other accounts, of having delivered to
the Austro-German military attaches
the reports received at Swiss head
quarters regarding the movements
and the disposition of Swiss troops
along the frontier. Later dispatches
have referred to the popular excite
ment which had been aroused with re
gard to the accusations made against
the two colonels and which culminat
ed In the tearing down of a German
flag by an angry crowd in the city
of Lausanne.
WITHHOLD REPLY
Catholic Prelates Will Not En
ter Into Controversy Over
Joint Letter of Belgian
Clergy.
j Berlin, Feb. 19, 12-45 a. m., via
London, 5:27 a. m. The Koslniscne
Vblke Zeitung says It can state au
thoritatively that the German Catho
lic bishops will not make a reply to
the joint letter of the bishops of Bel
glum, which recited instances of atro
cities alleged to have been commit
ted In Belgium and recounted the
grievances of the people of Belgium
ana proposeu an mvusugauuu ou me
-subject -by German prelates.' - --
The Zeitung adds:
"We are convinced that this refusal
on the part of the German episcopate
Is to be attributed primarily to the
desire of Pope Benedict that contro
versies of this kind between bishops
of different nationalities be avoided.
The refusal is also quite comprehen
sible, since the letter only tends to
increase the present political excite
ment among theBelgia n people."
A dispatch from Paris on February
15, said that, according to Rome ad
vices, the cardinals and bishops of
Germany and Austria were preparing
a collective statement In answer to
the letter of the Belgian bishops. This
letter, dated November 24, 1915, and
signed by Cardinal Mercler, and by
the other members of tho Belgian
Catholic episcopate, was addressed
to the cardinals and bishops of Ger
many, Bavaria, and Austria-Hungary,
and contained an appeal, In the narao
of their common religion, for justice
for the clergy and faithful of Belgium.

YUAN SHI HI
IS OPTIMISTIC
Rebellion Only an Uprising
and Chinese Government
Fully Able to Handle
Situation.
Peking, China, Feb. 19. In an ex
clusive Interview with tho correspon
dent of tho Associated Press, at tho
palace today, President Yuan Shi Kal
minimized tho importance of the re
bellion now In progress and express
ed confidence of tho ability of the
government to suppress the uprising
when adequate troops reach the up
per Yangtse Kiang. Vice Admiral
Thai Ting Kan, confidential secretary
of Yuan Shi Kal acted as interpreter
"This is no campaign, but only a
skirmish," said Yuan Shi Kal, "but It
ghes me so much work that it in
creases my appetite."
The president replied laughingly to
a remark regarding his excellent
physical condition and good spirits,
refuting rumors of his 111 health.
Discussing his enthronement, he
said:
"Although a date In February was
sanctioned, tho enthronement could
not tako place because of tho Yunnan
rebellion, which necessitated military
operations. Therefore it was decided,
with saddened hearts, to postpono it"
To Draft New Constitution.
The president said the drafting of a
new constitution would bo begun in a
few days.. When it is finished tho
constitution will go before a national
convention for suggestions. He did
not predict the date of promulgation
or tho constitution.
Discussing Its nature, he said:
"We shall adopt from all countries
the provisions best suited to China,
r
without leaning toward any foreign
constitution."
Yuan Shi Kai had this to say re
garding probable recognition of the
monarchy:
"I cannot tell what " governments
will or will not delay. Each will
recognize tho monarchy according to
circumstances."
China Strictly Neutral.
Regarding China's position as af
fected by the war, the president said:
"China has made every effort to
maintain strict neutrality. The Chl
neso government Is not aware that
the entente powers or tho other bol
iigeronts have made any substantial
charges against us for not having
done so. China will endeavor to re
main on friendly terms with all the
treaty powers."
Yuan Shi Kal then reverted to the
Insurrection.
"Yunnan and Kwei-Chow have few
troops and little ammunition," ho said.
"How soon the rebellion will bo
crushed depends upon the roads and
the rapidity of communication. You
must remember that it was easy for
the rebels to make a short dash Into
Sze-Chuen, whereas the government
troops must make a difficult trip to
reach the rebels. Well supplied
troops will speedily suppress the reb
els on reaching the scene.
"A few ambitious leaders, without
popular support, are engineering the
rebellion. The voting showed that
the public favors a monarchy."

DEPUTIES IN CHARGE
Steamship Claimed Under
Prussian Treaty Provisions
as Interpreted by British
Attorneys in Prize
Cases.
Washington, Feb. 19. Attorneys for
the British owners of the liner Appam,
In Hampton Roads as a prize of a Ger
man crow, have brought an admiralty
proceeding under the prize laws to re
Tain possession of tho ship. The state
department holds that under tho Prussian-American
treaty the liner belongs
to Germany as a prize, at least until
a prize court passed on the legality of
her capture The British embassy has
contended tho ship should be returned
to her owners under a provision of
The Hague convention.
Collector Hamilton at Newport
News reported today to tho treasury
department that a representative of
the United States marshal's office had
appeared there today with a federal
court writ to serve on the Appam. The
marshal had chartered a tug, Mr. Ham
ilton said, and with about thirty depu
ties on board left Norfolk to servo the
writ.
Collector Hamilton said he had made
no attempt to stop him and received
instructions from Assistant Treasurer
Peters at Washington not to inter
fere in any way. Mr. Hamilton did
not know why the marshal needed so
many deputies.
It is considered probable that the
case will be bitterly contested and
that the supreme court will havo to
flnallv pass upon It. Such proceed
ings might not bo settled for several
years.
Berg Opposes Officer.
When Deputy West and his party
reached tho Appam, Lleutonant Berg
attempted to prevent tho posting of
tho libel notice.
Deputy West stated his mission and
wa3 taken to Lieutenant Berg's quar
ters. The latter at once objected to
proceedings.
"If I had known you were the Unit
ed States marshal," he said, "I would
not havo allowed you aboard."
Personal Process Served.
The personal process was served
and the deputy then started to tack
the usual libel notico on the mast of
the vessel. The German commander
objected strenuously. - - -
'7,The ship is in charge of Collector
Hamilton," he said, "and you have no
right here."
Lieutenant Berg then left the Ap
pam hurriedly and went to Newport
News to telephone. When he return
ed Deputy West had tacked on the
mast of "the ship the slip of white
paper which certified that the Appam
had been seized by order of the Unit
ed States district court at Norfolk.
Lieutenant Berg directed his men to
tear It down.
Deputy West commanded him not
to touch tho notico and It remained
on the mast.
Deputy West left two watchmen In
charge of the vessel and tho rest of
th- party returned to Norfolk.
Floyd Hughes, local counsel for the
libellants, said all information con
cerning the case should come from
Mr Cludert In Now York, counsel for
the Appam's owners. It is under
stood hero, however, that the libel
ants base their case upon the provi
sions of the Prussian-American treaty
under which tho German government
claims that In order to claim the bene
fit of the neutral port the prize must
have been convoyed In by a warship.
This was not dono in tho case of the
Appam. .
Papers in the action upon which
the Appam was seized were filed In
the United States district court at
Norfolk February' 18, but were with
held from the public.
Steamship Illegally Withheld.
Tho owners allego "that the said
steamship is wrongfully withheld
from the libellants by one, Hans Berg,
and other persons unknown to the
libellants."
n-v.v fnrMinr nllotrf that the Appam
"on about the 16th of January was
unlawfully seized by certain persons
unknown to the libellants and there
after under compulsion forced to pro
ceed with passengers, crew and cargo
to Hampton Roads.'
Collector Hamilton's report to
Washington concerning tho departure
of Deputy West with some thirty men
was made on unofficial Information
Tho deputy was accompanied by only
four men. Mr. West, It Is said, did
not confer with Collector Hamilton.
Tne collector has protested against
the alleged failure of the marshal to
co-operate with the collector's office.
Norfolk, Va., Feb. 19 Federal Judge
Waddlll Issued tho usual libel process
and the Appam was seized by a dep
uty United States marshal who went
to Newport News on a tug for the
purpose. Two guards from tho office

Shanghai, China, Feb. 19. The
American steamship China, which left
Shanghai yesterday morning for San

seas by a British auxiliary cruiser
and 3S Germans were taken off.
It is though sho may have been held

surrender forty German reservists.
Tho Germans took passage from Hong
Kong to San Francisco and it was
said they had received assurances
from Washington that thoy would not
be molested while on an American
vessel. Officers of the China said
that Great Britain, in their opinion,
had acted within their rights. The
Manchuria was boarded within the
three mile limit. .
