(Svvatlska - News Correspondence.)
H. l'ettit, anil J. W. Angel hole,
formed u partnership to be known
as the Des Moines Cement Block ;
and Brick .Manufacturing anJ Con
struction Company, builders audi
contractor! with It. l'ettit, as man- ,
ager and J. W. Angel as assistant
manager. It is their purpose to
make cement blocks and cement
brick as well as do a general con
tracting business. The machine to
make the cement, bricks has been
ordered. It will have- a capacity of í
10.000 brick a day.
Mr. l'ettit informs us that the ce
ment brick can lie made at a cost
that will allow them to sell them at
at about 1.50 under the cost of
shale brick per thousand, and they
will be belter for nil purposes than
the shale or pressed brick. We
understand that the new firm is
contemplating the erection of a 50x '
120 cement block iiud brick building
for the housing of their plant. Am-,
pie capital has been secured for the
new plant and it will probably rep-,
resent about MC.00,) invested when
all machinery is installed.
This plant will add a payroll to
the town and will therefore be more
than welcome. Mr. Angel is one of!
our good men and l'ettit has done :
well to interest him in this venture.1
Sania Fe Locates Depot.
Last Thursday Superintendent F.
L.Myers of the Katoirdivision of
the Sana Fe railroad came lo Des'
Monies in his special car for a con- i
(pence with the mayor Hud ,ov.v
lio;u'd of Des Moines relative to va
cating that portion of Yalesijuez i
.street that adjoined the right of :
way. He explailied that the Santa
Fe wished to place a depot at that
point and by putting it on the north
.side of the track a great deal of un- i
necessary hauling could be avoided.;
As this street has never been used j
south of the track the towu offi-
rials readily gave their consent and
will at the next meeting of the
board take the necessary steps.
Luucliard Will Build. j
Don Louchard closed the deal on
Tuesday for the lot between the!
bunk of Des Moines and the llarless
Spell building and us soon as plans
can be drawn will erect a building j
uii this lot. He plans to extend the
building 20 feet or more, making it j
25x80 for the main building and i
probably some warehouse room in j
the rear of this. This will be a good
building in a good location and ca-
pable of bousing a splendid slock j
of hardware.

HENRY BEERLY. GARAGE MAN
KILLED- BY FLYING PULLEY
Highly Itespecleil Cilien And Mas
ter Mechanic of Kenton Is Vic
tim of Singular Accident.
(Record-News Correspondence.)
Kenton, Okla., Wednesday Henry
Iteerly, for many years a resident of
this community, received injuries at
I :3(i this afternoon from which he
died at ii:30 p. in. A pulley break
ing loose from a shaft and striKtng
Mr. Iteerly in the head crushing his
skull is supposed to have been the :
cause of bis ileal U although no one
was wilh Mr. Iteerly at the time of
the accident.
A noise was heard coining from
the rear, department of The Ken
ton Blacksmith Shop and Oarage,
caused by a pulley wheel which was'
flung through a rear window. As
Itichard I'yles was working on a
wagon near by, he ran to see what
was the matter and found that Hen
ry Iteerly had been struck with the
pulley, badly mutilating the side of
his face, llicliard immediately stop
ped the engine and run to the
street and called for help. Oeorge
HyhliHrd an:' Crit Allen.- heiring,
il u i c k I y responded. T h e
three carried the body to the Hotel
f. almilla and Dr. M Migan soon ar
rived. Life bad not entirely de
parted from Mr. Iteerly until about
i:30 of the same afternoon of the
accident, but be was far from con
sciousness. The catastrope is one of the
greatest shocks that Kenton ever
had, as Mr. lieerly was one of the
best citizens that could occasion
any community. He was as straight
forward and us industrious as he
was straight-forward and has been
acknowledged by all to be the hard
est working man in the country.
Mr. Iteerly was a ,mastcr mechanic
both with automobiles and other
wise and liked by everyone. He
built ui a blacksmithshop and gar
age that Kenton is proud of and
his absence will be felt grievously.
Mr. Iteerly leaves a wife and 3
children to mourn the" separation.
Funeral services were held at the
M. E. Church of Kenton, where he
was a member, at three o'clock
Thursday, after which interment
was made in the Kenton cemetery.

CLAYTON GRAIN SRiMENTS
MAKE FLATTERING .SHOWING
Dili Kinmliirant Cars Received at
Clayton and Des Moines In Last
Three Years.
During the past three years I here
have been llii emniigra;.! cars un
loaded at Clayton and Dos Moines.
Sixty-one of these had Clayton as
a destination, fifty-five were hilled
for Des Moines.
On account of the some 5o advan
tage per car of having Texline as
destination it is probable that more
cars have been unloaded at that
point than all Union county points
combined.
Our figures were obtained from
Assistant General Passenger and
Freight Agent Oeorge Williams for
the C. S. Mr. Williams estimates
that half as many as the total have
been unloaded at Orenville, Mt. Dora
Folsom and Orande.
Clayton received more cars in
1915 than in either of the two prior
years, while Des Moines" heaviest
year was toll when 23 cars were
unloaded there against 15 ju IOih
and 17 in tli',5. ' i'
It is interesting to note that the
great increase of grain shipments
from Clayton and Des Moines.
Clayton's 1915 shipments were more
than three times as great as the ag
gregate of 1913 and 1!I I. In 111 1.1
there were 150 cars of grain, 121
cars of live stock, (5(5 cars of broom
corn and 110 aers oí beans, the lat
ter being almost four times the ag
gregate of both 11)13 and It'll. Des
Moines shows a slight decrease in
grain shipments, but an increase in
livestock. Folsom shows the heav
iest live stock shipments of any sta
tion in Union county, sending 1H3
cars in 1915.
WHERE?
Where will Clayton's new $3.1,000
school house he located?
Where is the must suitable site?
In this rapidly advancing country
$3.1,000 is not a very elaborate
amount to spend on an educational
Institution. We bclice the school
trustees feel that the entire amount
should lie spent on the building and
its cmupineiiL
The News believes that the board
should not be forced to use a much
needed portion oí the $3.1,000 in the
purchase of u site.
Is any individual or set of individ
uals sufficiently interested to give
or collectively give a block, or bet
ter, two blocks of ground, wiiere the
building will not only advertise it
self but be located to the advantage
or the greatest number of students
and patrons? v'

Idle Mines In I '.rope Cause I'riics to
Advance on Implements and
All Metal Staples.
While it is news, rather infor
mation, it may not be welcomed
with open arms by anyone and sure
ly the farmer will be inclined to
uses oine picturesque language. We
refer to the recent raise in price of
almost alt metal staples, especially,

practically every mine in that

the greatest in the world's history.
United States is now the only pro
ducer of iron ore.
According to two of Clayton's
dealers, llobt. W. Isaacs and Otto-

creased $1.00 per hundred in the last
eight JUonths unit the (rend of
market indicates "higher" with

From coiiiiimnications to these
Isvo firms we learn that nearly
every steel mill in the United
States is working three shifts. Two
years ago one eight hour shift sup
plied the demand.
Union county farmers feel this
hike in the price more than many
older communities because of ac
tual need of farm implements and
wire. i

Taxpayers of District No. 1 CJuyU
Will Pity $1,300 Less As Hesult
of Change.
On account of the state tax com
mission reducing the tax levy o
certain school districts it will bj
i necessary for the assessor's office
' forre to make a new abstract vt

: about ten days before the office is
ready to receive taxes.

"The tax roll ot Union county
, having been received and examined
1 it is noted that the total production
of the It'll taxes exceeds the maxi-
, ,,,,,, fixe.l by the tax commission
by 83,100.17, principally caused by
an increase in the total valuation
from $10,517.211 to $10,990,8(5o. or
a difference of .173,(552, which i
crease in uluatiou was not untici-
! listed.
"After consulting with you today
in detail as to the most practical
maimer the excess of 3,100.47, could
be eliminated, it is now suggested
that at a meeting of your board th
following changes in levies be madi
affecting the special school dis
tricts enumerated.
"School District No i reduce from
! frt1M
HOI mills to .007 mills thereby
making a reduction in the exten
tion of laxes in the sum of $1,233.14.

! "School Distirct No. 71 reduce from
1 .00525 mills to .0012 mills, thereby
i making a reduction in the exten
sion of (axes in the sum of $417.64.

mentioned reductions amounts U
$3. 10(5.7 li, which will bring the total
j production of all county tax levies
i $(0.29 under the maximum amount
of .103,381.00 as fixed by the tax
commission.
"Vou no doubt realize tho neces
sity of formal action by your board
in making such changes as will
bring the total production of all
county levies within the prescribed
limit.
"When such formal action is tak
en, kindly advise us of that fact.
"Very truly yours,
