FARM DEMONSTRATION WORK

Soil Inoculation.
The importanceof legume crops
for soil improvement has long
been established in the minds of
good farmers. This soil enrich
ment is due largely to the ac
cumulation of available nitrogen
left in the soil by the leguminous
crops, and this accumulation of
nitrogen is caused by the presence
of minute soil bacteria which
possess the power of growing on
the roots of the leguminous plants
and then gathering free nitrogen
from the air and converting it
into available food for them and
for succeeding crops.
For the opportunity to grow
satisfactorily and to fix nitrogen,
these bacteria are dependent up
on certain host plants, on the
roots of which they form charac
teristic growths or enlargements
called "nodules." With each of
these crops is associated its own
individual strain of legume bac
tria; for example, the bacteria
which produce nodules upon al
falfa will not form nodules upon
the Lima bean, cowpea, or pea
nut.
In view of these facts, it is evi
dent that for the most successful
growth of alfalfa, clovers, and
other legume crops, the proper
organisms should be abundantly
present in the soil. Certain lo
calities are so supplied, as for ex
ample, this region with the cow.
pea organism, and sectis atof
the middle west which usually
are already thoroughly inoculated
with alfalfa organisms. Even
with the cowpea in this parish,
inoculation was of great value in
1915. Introducing new kinds of
leguminous crops into a locality
requires the introduction also of
the proper bacteria for the legume
selected and this is best accom
plished by artificial inoculation.
For example, it is useless to
plant crimson clover in this lo
cality without soil inoculation,
but if it was inoculated, it is the
best winter cover crop we can
ge t. For soy beans, alfalfa,
clovers, etc.. that you expect to
plant during the coming season,
you can secure enough inoculating
material for two bushels of seed,
free of charge, from the Bureau
of Plant Industry, Department of
Agriculture, Washington, D. C.
For further information, or for
application blanks for liquid cul
ture of nitrogen-fixing bacteria
for any legume plant, apply to
your 4oal farm demonstration
agent in his office at Colfax on
Saturday of each week.
For Childress Cough.
You cannot use anything better for
your child's cough and cold than Dr.
King's New Discovery. It is prepared
frompine tar mixed with healing and
soothing balsams. It does not contain
anything harmful and is slightly laxa
tive, just enough to expel the poisons
from the system. Dr. King's New I
Discovery is antiseptic, kills the cold
germs, raises the phlegm. loosens the
cough and soothes the irritation. Dont I
put off treatment. Coughs and colds
often lead to serious lung troubles. It
is also goon for adults and the aged.

can always depend on Sloas's Liniment.
It penetrates to the seat of pain and
