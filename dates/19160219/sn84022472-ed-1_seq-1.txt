or. just after dark last night. He saw
his, mother on the bed 'tout thought
she was asleep and it was late before
he noticed the gun and cartridges.
The shack is said to be 8 feet by 12
feet in area. It is located deep in the

of a gunshot from the direction of the
shack. . The constables say that John

HALE QUESTIONED
BY FEDERAL AGENT
Says He Prefers Monopoly
in Control So f Far As
State Is Concerned.
New "York, Feb. 19. The shippers of
Connecticut favor continued control
by the New York, New Haven & Hart
ford" Railroad company of its steam-'
ship lines, a cording' to members of the
public utilities oommision of Connect
icut, who were witnesses today before
the Interstate Commerce Commission
er Judson C. Clements in the hearing
on the roads aplieation to retain Its
boat lines under the Panama Canal
Act.
J. H. Hale of Olastontouny, a mem
ber of the utilities body and a heavy
shipper, testified that his comimission
conducted an inquiry to determine the
attitude of the people of Connecticut,
both ehlpers and New Haven road
Stockholder's, toward the New Haven's
petition and found that, the general
opinion was that it would be "univer
sally unwise at thds time" for the gov
ernment to decree a divorcement.
H. Elder, representing the interstate
commerce commission, asked Mr. Hale
whether, in his opinion, the same com
petition existed between rail and wa
ter lines owned Jointly as existed when
the boat lines were operated independ
ently, but he insisted that rates were
higher and that "the shipeprs would
have to pay." The service now, the
witness described e "excellent and
satisfactory. " .
Mr. Elder asked Mr. Hale if he
knewtS.t; tii 116,- a proppmus, in
dependent water line, the Hartford &
iNew York, was bought by the New
Haven through the railroad giving
$200 par value of New Haven stock
for every $100 par value of the "in
dependent line's stock. The witness
was aware of this. ; , ,
"As public utilities commissioner.do
you think it was proper for the New
Haven road to make such a pur
chase?" Mr. Hale was asked. "The
New Haven's action has not interfered
with the quality of service," Mr. Hale
replied. "Monopoly was preferable to
competition," he added, "insofar as
the New Haven ',s joint .control exists
in Connecticut today."
C. C. Elwell, of New Haven, an
other member of the public utilities
commission, testified that an inquiry
convinced him that it was "the uni
versal desire" of the people of Con
necticut that the New Haven continue
to own Its boats. He had been em
ployed by the New Haven road ,at
various times, he testified, but denied
knowledge of any "pressure" being
exerted by the road to force an inde
pendent steamboat line to carry fer
tilizer and other "obnoxious ship
ments."

YEAR AND HALF
ON SMALL ISLE
- Jacksonville, Fla., Feb. 19 A letter
mailed at Honolulu on Feb. 3. was

T. Mfdison, of Whitehall, 111., relating
how with a number of others he was
marooned for nearly a year and a half
on an island off the west coast of
Suoh America, after leaving the Brit
ish steamer Bella Donna, which was
sunk by a German cruiser in Sep
tember, 1914.
The letter , which was received by
his grandmother, Mrs. Rebecca Madi
son, said : - -
"For the last year and a half I have
been on a little island in the South
Sea, where no ships ever stop.
"I was on the English ship Bella

ber "we weres topped off the west coast
of South America by a German
cruiser. They forced us to go in our
small boats and then sank our ship.
The dayj after we ran into a pretty
stiff gale and were blown away south.
We brought upon a small Island
among a group of several. There were
a few friendly natives there and one

about 40 days ago when a small 'sail

ers in Seven Tongues, and
Arranges For Conference j
That May End Differences '
Sub-Committee of Workmen l
To Confer Today With Of- j
cial of the Company J
Agitators Are Hooted j
Down In Big Meeting.
Ansonia, Conn., Feb. 19 '
"The strike in Ansonia will be)
settled without any clash," said
Joseph Grohol, the young man
who by his knowledge of seven
languages and his tact, has
gained almost complete control
over the 2,000 or 'more striking
laborers of the American Brass
Co., after a big strikers meet
ing today.
"We will have peace at any
cost," he sodded, and then he
stated that he had found by
getting the committeesvof the
several nationalities together
that the strikers have found out
that they had made a mistake,
that they are willing to be fair,
and that the officials of the!
company, on the otlier hand,
are willing to discuss the situ
ation. Grohol felt confident;
that the strike will end this af-i
ternoon after the conference
between a sub-committee of !
the strikers genera,; committee
and the company's pfficerr.
Mr. ; Grohol wanted f 4l-V point em-
phasized that' the actual . number of
strikers is about 2,000 and that the '
additional 2,500 employes who are out
are in' enforced idleness. The fact I
that these latter did not resist ' the J
rush 'of the strikers saved the situa- j
tion. .Grohol also explained just what)
brought on the strike. It arose from j
a misunderstanding over an increase j
in pay promised the laborers by- the j
company last 'November.
According to Grohol the company!
gave their laborers an advance of
2 1-2 cents an hour under an agree
ment entered in November with the
additional promise of an additional
2 1-2 cents effective'' February 14.
When the laborers got their pa en-1
velopes Tuesday and Wednesday they1,
did not lind in them the advance
promised which additional wage would
have been in the pay envelopes to
be distributed next week Tuesday and
Wednesday1 This accounts for the
unanimity of feeling on the , part'' o?
the men for a strike.
The action was started without any
one having stopped to make an in
quiry about the advaftice and with
practically every one of the 2,000 la-;
borers believing that he had a person
al grievance. 1 It was not until today's
meeting of the strikers that the condi
tions were understandingly explained
to the men.
Grohol was In control of this meet
ing which was held in Sarsfeld hall,
the place loaned to the strikers by
Grohol as the property is a part of
his father's estate. Tjhe meeting be
gan early in the forenoon and lasted
until nearly noon. There were from'
800 to 900 present as a general esti
mate. .
Before It started, half a dozen men v
who appeared to be agitators, began
to harangue the crowd but Grohol
pushed his Way to the front and or
dered them to stop, saying that he was
not going to stand for any violence'
or any plea for strife. He demanded
that these speakers stop and asked
the crowd to uphold him. The men
stopped . talking' when the crowd
shouted to the effect .that they would
be thrown opt of the hall.
Grohol advised no drastic action as
he thought that the men, who were
also' strikers, had a right to stay but
they also had to keep quiet unless
they were on their general committee. t
Grohol suggested that the only speak-
ers at the meeting be members of the
general committee. This plan was j
