THE DARK
TOBACCO
SITUATION
Discussed Bjf Prof. W. D. Nich
olls, of The State Agricul
tural Station.
SUGGESTS CURTAILMENT NOW
War Situation Makes Demand
, Less Every Year and Unsold
Stock Accumulates.
Lexington, Ky., Feb. 18. -Professor
Nicholls, of the State University
Agricultural Station, who yisited the
dark, tobacco district of the State as a
special representative of the Experi
ment Station last week, in his report
to iks station say a critical situation
lias been caused in that section by the
lack of market for tobacco and sug
gests that the farmers of Western
Kentucky turn to diversified farming
and produce only light crops. The
report states that there is no single
crop which can replace tobacco in that
section, but that a complete change to
growing green crops, cow peas, soy
beans, corn, garden truck, for use in
home and farm, seeds and raising
hogs. Cows and poultry in a greater
quantity will be the best way to meet
the emergency,
Professor Nicholls worked in co
operation with Professor L. R. Noel,
of tho Tennessee Experiment Station
and the two representatives spent
two days studying the situation. They
undertook to look over the condition
and advise concerning the modifica
tion of th. existing.-emergency at tho
request of the -'Planters' Protective
Association.
"A peculiar and distressing situa
tion is faced by the farmers cof the
dark tobacco section," the report
reads, "Dark tobacco is tho princi
pal source of income in the region and
has befln grown by many farmers to
the neglect j)f other crops. The great
er part of the tobacco produced in this
district is bought by foreign buyers
and goes to European countries.
"The average price paid under nor
mal conditions for dark tobacco is
nine cents a pound. There has been
practically no market for tobacco crops
since the opening of the European
war. Less than forty per cent of the
1915-crop has been sold and that was
disposed of at four and a half cents a
pound. Ocean freight rates, which
were formerly $3.00 per hogshead are
now $18 and the insurance has risen
from,$1.50to$6." '
Tho seriousness of the situation in
Western Kentucky, according to Pro
fessor Nicholls, is made greater be
cause tobacco has been the principal
source of income for so long that the
production of other crops has been
almost excluded. There ia no other
product that can take the place of to-
Dacco in mat section us uemp wis in
the burlcy district. Tobacco and
I grain have been grown
there until
the soil is at present very much de
pleted and can produce only light
crops. The acreage is thin and lacks
humus.
The renort suggests that an ex
change bo mado from raising tobacco
and grain and advises that tho best
results may bo obtained trom giving
attention to the things with which the
agriculturists of the section are fa
mjiiar. Hogs, farm poultry, and cows
nro succestcd as money bringers. Tho
market for these is always good
Small increases in the number of
sows, pigs and shoats raised on the
different farms in the district will add
hundreds of thousands of dollars io
tho region. A small added income
may result from tho production 0
poultry and garden vegetables, such
as Irish and sweet jwtatoes, beans and
sorghum.
The exchange to the raisin2 0' ver
satile crops should be able to secure
for tho farmers in the aggregate an
income sufficient to go a long way
toward piecing out tho reduced in
come resulting from tho curtailment
of tobacco ocreace. It slwukl also in

100,000 IN ERZERUM GARRISON. I
Estimates from Petrograd place the
number of troops in the Turkish gar
rison at Erzewim, the capture of which
has been announced, at 100,000 men.
The guns numbered more than 1,000.
But it has not yet been officially stated
that all of these troops and guns were
taken by the Russians.
That the fighting before the fortress
fell was terrific is indicated by a Con
stantinople report, which, although
not announcing the capture of Erzer
um, says that in the last few days be
fore the. communication was issued
the Russians had lost 5,000 men killed.
QUIET ON WESTERN FRONT.
Both Berlin and t Paris report that
there have been no important devel
opments on the battle lines, both in
France and Belgium. On tho Russian
front there have been artillery en
gagements and isolated infantry ac

cia, hostilities' have almost ceased for
the present.
ThpJtalians are still engaged in
shelling the positions taken from them

THE COMMISSION BILL PASSES
The Speaking Campaign To
Be
Inaugurated On Next
Tuesday.
Ira D. Smith and Alvan H. Clark,
who went to Frankfort Wednesday to
look after local bills, lost no time in
sending back good news.
In a telegram to R. E. Cooper
Thursday morning they reported that
the court of appeals Wednesday hand-
ed down a decision that a majority
so stated that the enabling act, per
mitting the fiscal court of Christian
county to turn over the good roads
fund to a commission, had passed in
the house and would be adopted by
the senate without any opposition.
This clears the way for action in the
good roads campaign. With a bare
majority all that is, needed, it is re
garded as practically assured that the
$400,000 bond proposition will easily
pass. But a lively campaign will be
started next week all the same.
Speakers will be sent out and the
proposition explained wherever it is
not already understood. Some ap
pointments have been made at the
following places:
At 1:30 p. m. on next Tuesday,
Feb. 22, speakings will be held sim
ultaneously at Fruit Hill, Adams,
Hawkins, Honey Grove, Lafayette
and Herndon.
The next day, Wednesday, Feb". 23,
at 1:30 p. m. speakings will be held
at Fairview and Elmo.
. On Thursday, Feb. 24, at 1:30 p. m.
Church Hill and Longview will be the
Lplaces visited.
On Friday, Feb. 25th, at 1:30 p. m.
the speakings will be at Sinking Fork
and East School House.

LAW MUST
BE FULLY
OBEYED
America Will Accept Nothing
Less in Submarine Contro
versy With Germany.
WANTS FULL ASSURANCE.
German Diplomats Sav Ger
many Will Not Modify Order;
as to Armed Ships.
Washington, D. C, Feb. 18. Tlie?
United States in its submarine contro
versy with Germany will accept
nothing short of a full and complete
agreement covering all other points
for which it has contended as to- as
surances that the warfare in the fu
ture would be conducted in accord
ance with the established principles
of international law.
In announcing that fact Secretary
Lansing let it be known that the state
department considers Germany's ia
claration of its intention to sink with
out warning after February 29 all
armed merchant ships of the entente
allies to be inconsistent with the as
surances previously given this gov
ernment. The tentative communication de
signed to end the Lusitania case wiU
not be formally accepted until such
assurances are given, although the
communication in so far as it relates
to the Lusitania itself, is acceptable.
State department officials also con
sider that the Austro-Hungarian
memorandum regarding armed ships
is not in accordance with the assur
ances given by that government in
the negotiations over the sinking of
the Ancona. Consequently final set
tlement of the Ancona case probably
will be withheld until Austria gives
similar assurances to those now re
quired from Germany.
WILL NOT MODIFY ORDER.
It was stated emphatically in Teu
tonic diplomatic circles that the Ber
lin foreign office would not modify
the declaration of intention to sink
armed ships or inform the United
States the previous assurances still
were binding unless Great Britain
should give assurances of some kind
that a submarine which warns a
British steamship, armed ostensibly
for defensive purposes, would not be
fired upon.
