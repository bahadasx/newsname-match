Held By Americans
Washington, D. C., Feb. 18.—The
submarine situation with its new de
velopments was discussed at today's
cabinet meeting. Secretary Lansing
went to the white house before the
cabinet assembled and discussed the
question with the president at some
length.
It was indicated today that Austria,
too, will be notified of the assurances
which the United States is asking for
the future, so that the position of this
government may be fully and uniform
ly known to the Germanic allies.
GERMANY IS INFORMED.
Washington, D. C., Feb. 18.—A long
7 dispatch from Ambassador von Bern
etorff was on its way to Berlin today
explaining that in its negotiations
with Germany over submarine war
fare, the United States will accept
nothing short of a complete agree
ment covering all points for which it
has contended as to assurance that the
warfare in the future will be con
ducted in connection with the estab
lished principles of international law.
It Is understood that the ambasaa

United States considers Germany's
declaration of its intention to
In Teutonic diplomatic circles it was
stated that the Berlin foreign office
would not modify the declaration of
intention to sink armed ships or in
reform this country that previous as
purances were binding unless Great
Britain should give assurances that
submarine which warns a British
ship carrying defense armament
would not be fired on.
GERMANS WORRIED
OVER BIRTH RATE
Berlin, Feb. 17. The declining
birth rate in Germany, which was at
tracting attention before the war, is
receiving more serious consideration
In view of the losses sustained in the
field. This subject was brought up to
day in the budget committee of the
Prussian diet. A representative of the
ministry predicted that unless a radi
cal change should be made, Germany
Would soon be in the position of
France, with deaths exceeding births.
The speaker also referred to the
high rate of infant mortality. He also
I /M said one of the gravest hindrances to
the growth of the population was the
Increase in the number of premature
births caused deliberately, an evil
which was not confined to the poorer
classes.
SWEDES PROHIBIT
DANISH SHIPMENTS
London, Feb. 18.—A Copenhagen
dispatch to the Exchange Telegraph
Co. says that, according to the
inaellposten, the Swedish minister of
ustice has appointed a royal commis
ilon to prohibit transportation along
Swedish territorial waters of goods
lorbidden to be exported from Swed
m. The prohibition is said to be di
rected against Danish merchants who
ire largely interested in transporting
nerchandise to Russia through Swed
sh waters. This step, the newspaper
oints out, will make the Baltic a still
nore closed inland sea, the conditions
»eing especially aggravated by the
tew mine field which the Germans
tave laid at the entrance into the Bal-
Ic.

SENATOR LODGE
WINTSU.SITO
SOLON TELLS SENATE THAT THI8
COUNTRY MUST NOT ABANDON
ITS SEA PRINCIPLES.
Washington, D. C., Feb. 18.—Senator
Lodge, ranking minority member of
the foreign relations committee, made
a speech in the senate today declaring
that abandonment by the United
States at this time of the principle
that its ports were open to and its
citizens free to travel upon merchant
men of belligerent nations armed sole
ly for defensive purposes, would be an
unneutral act and a step toward war.
He said it would make the United
States the ally of the belligerent whose
merchant marine had been swept from
the seas.
The senator spoke at length, dwelling
on the history of international law re
lating to the arming of merchantmen
for defense and citing precedents in
the record of the United States. He
referred to reports that the administra
tion was preparing to change its
policy, which have been denied by
Secretary Lansing since the issuance
of the German and Austrian memoran
dums announcing their Intention to
treat armed merchant ships as war ves
sels after February 29. As late as the
president's note of May 13, 1915, sign
ed by Mr. Bryan, Senator Lodge said,
this government recognized that
"American citizens were within their
undisputed rights in taking their ships
and in traveling wherever their legiti
mate business calls them on the high
seas."
Stand on This Law.
"The abandonment of those rights
by any neutral government on the
ground that the Invention of sub
marines with the necessary limitations
on the powers of capture possessed by
tbose boats is incenceivable. Such
abandonment could only rest on the
ground that rights of neutrals, the
roles which for centuries have been
agreed upon by all nations for the pro
tection of innocent lives on vessels
captured in war, must be thrown aBlde
and discarded In order that a new In
strument of maritime destruction must
not be impeded in its work of death
and murder.
"There is, however, another side to
this matter which is of even graver
importance. There can be no question
that any act by a neutral which alters
conditions created by the war is an un
neutral act and places the neutral on
the side of one belligerent or the
ether.
Against Embargo.
"This is eminently true of any form
of embargo, and there Is no need that
I should repeat the unanswerable
argument on this point embodied by
Mr. Lansing in his note of last August
to the government of AuptriarHungary.
The war and the war alone has also
created conditions under which any
change at this time in the attitude
which we took officially at the outset
of the war in regard to armed mer
chantmen would be an unneutral act.
"I can not believe that the adminis
tration thinks for a moment of altering
the well defined position which it took
at the outset of the European war, and
I believe that it must stand as firmly
on this question as it has on the ques
tion of the embargo. Should it act
otherwise it would accept a humilia
tion and incur a danger of war from
which even the boldest and the most
unscrupulous would shrink."

CAUCUS OF MARJORITY IN CON
GRESS DECIDES TO REPEAL
FREE SUGAR ACT.
Washington, D. C., Feb. 18.—Legis
lation repealing the free sugar clause
of the Underwood tariff law before
May 1, the date on which the provi
sion would become effective, with a
resultant annual loss of $40,000,000 of
revenue, virtually was assured today
as a result of the action of the house
democratic caucus last night.
The proposed legislation was decid
ed on by a vote of 84 to 20, after a
vigorous fight against It led by Repre
sentative Keating of Colorado, who
denounced the action as a repudia
tion of party doctrine. Ten democrats
declined, because of other pledges or
convictions, to be bound by the cau
cus decision.
FIRE STILL RAGING.
Butte, Mont., Feb. 18.—Fire, which
caused the loss Monday night of
twenty-one lives in the Anaconda Cop
per Co.'s Pennsylvania mine, still was
raging today, the damage already done
being estimated at $100,000. Concrete
bulkheads are being thrown up in

HOUTTHETIIRKS
Army Defending Erzerum
Broken and Forced to
Flee Before Victor
GREAT FORTRESS
POORLY DEFENDED
Latest Reports Indicate
That Garrison Was Not
Captured Intact
Petrograd, Feb. 18.—The fall of Er
zerum, the most Important Turkish
stronghold in Asia Minor, and for a
long time considered Impregnable, of
fers the unprecedented spectacle of
a first class fortress built on a steep
mountain ridge nearly a mile above
sea level yielding to bayonet attack
after only thirty-six hours' bombard
ment.
The operations were conducted un
der the most severe weather condi
tions, the snow being deep and the
thermometer registering at times
more than thirty degrees below zero.
The Turkish army defending Erze
rum, taken by surprise under the
methods adopted by the Russians, is
now said to be in disorderly' flight on
the roads leading to Sivas. As the
garrison apparently scattered In all
directions, it is assumed here that
large numbers of men were taken pris
oner, although official figures are still
lacking.
Turk* Over Confident.
After the taking of Niskala, it ap
peared that the Russian attack would
be directed on the Turkish right
flank, and by rapidly transferring
troops, the Turks made all plantf to
resist the main assault from this quar
ter. Apparently they had little fear
of the success of this attack because
of the strong character of the forti
fications In that direction and even
less apprehension of danger from a
frontal attael-
Neverthele.sa, after the Russians
took by storm the first line forts Feb
ruary 2, there began persistent bom
bardment of the Turkish center, fol
lowed by a bayonet charge, which
swept the defenders off their feet. The
highest tribute is paid to the bravery
of the Caucasian troops, whose charge
is considered one of the most brilliant
feats of the war.
It is recognized here that the suc
cess of the assault was due almost
entirely to the bayonet work of these
troops, since the artillery prepara
tions were insufficient in intensity a'nd
duration, according to military ex
perts, to reduce even a strong field
position.
Opens Way to Capital.
The wiping out of this Turkish base
tends to disrupt the whole Caucasus
campaign of the Turks, as it not only
served as a base of operations in the
Caucasus, but also of those In Meso
potamia. Its fall leaves no strongly
fortified point between Erzerum and
Sivas, about 230 miles to the west, and
brings more to the front consideration
of an eventual attack on Constantin
ople from the east.
An attempt to retake Erzerum is an
ticipated, but there are enormous dif
ficulties attending the bringing up of
Turkish reinforcements, as it is as
sumed that Turkish forces in Meso
potamia can not be spared. The
alternative for Turks seems to be to
draw on those at Constantinople, from
which all possible routes toward Erzer
um are long and arduous. The most
practicable is by railway to Urfa,
whence it would be necessary to
march overland more than 200 miles.
The Black sea route to Trebizond has
become impracticable because of the
Russian domination of the Black sea
littoral.
BRITONS REPULSED.
Berlin, Feb. 18.—The British have
made a new attempt to retake the
position south of Ypres, Belgium, re
cently captured by the Germans but
were beaten off with heavy losses, it
was officially announced today. The
army headquarters states that success
ful mine attacks were carried out
northwest of Lens.

SOUP POISONER
TRYING TO CAUSE
REIGN OF TERROR
JEAN CRONES AND FELLOW AN.
ARCHISTS AT WORK TO OVER
TURN GOVERNMENT.
Chicago, Feb. 18. —Following the
publication this morning In New York
newspaper of another letter believed
to have been written by Jean Crones,
former chef at the University club of
Chicago, local police officials put on
the New York authorities the burden
of responsibility for Crones' arrest.
Crones is charged with putting poison
in the soup served at the Mundelein
banquet.
The federal government operatives
here today continued to assist local
authorities in tracing reports that the
poisoning was the result of an anti
clerical plot of nation wide propor
tions. It was learned today that secret
service agents received warning of
such a conspiracy more than three
months ago. At that time it was re
ported that anarchistic leaders had
been holding secret meetings at Salida,
Colo., discussing plans for a "reign of
terror" to be created throughout the
United States by the destruction of
churches and public buildings. It was
reported that the new $2,500,000 fed
eral building at Denver, Colo., was
among those slated for destruction.
Letters from Salida, Colo., were found
among Crones' belongings.
CR0NE8 IN NEW YORK.
New York, Feb. 18. ^Believing that
Joan Crones, the Chicago chef accused
of poisoning the soup at a dinner of
Catholic clergymen and laymen in that
city, 1b in New York City or nearby,
the police made every effort today to
run him down. The authorities think
Crones is the author of two letters
mailed in this city to the New York
Times, in which the writer boasts that
he has escaped arrest and makes veil
ed threats.
The identification by John M. Mc
Court, assistant U. S. district attorney
at Scranton, Pa., of the fac simile of
the first Crones letter received here as
the handwriting of the man wanted in
Chicago, stimulated police authorities
here. Crones' writing was Men tilled
by examination papers he had sent to
a correspondence school In Scranton.

$350,000 in the conference of twenty
counties in this part of the state on
March 12 and will close on April 25.
The other $150,000 of the $600,000
authorized by the conference is to be

and lay delegates remained over for
today when the Methodist forward

entertaining speaker. He had a seri
ous message and he presented it -seri
ously yet he had enough of the dram
atic touch in his delivery to be inter
esting.
1
He dwelled on the sacrifices which
have been made by the pioneers of
Iowa and the early Methodists in the
state for the cause of Christian educa
tion within its borders.
The educational standards which
the Methodist church set up at the be
ginning of its existence were outlined
by the speaker and declared to have
occupied as important a place in the
minds of the founders as any evangel
istic ,plan.
Books Were Scattered.
The old plan of "scattering books,"
and the advice of those across the sea
to the newcomers here to "remember
the books," were mentioned by the
bishop and he declared that the oldest
circulating library in the United
States was the Methodist itinerate
preacher with his saddle bags full of
books.

PSEUDO-PRIEST
PAYS FOR CRIME
WITH HIS LIFE
HANS SCHMIDT 18 EXECUTED AT
SING SING GOES WILLINGLY
TO CHAIR.
Osslning, N. Y., Feb. 18.—Hans
Schmidt was electrocuted at Sing Sing
prison today for the murder of Anna
Aumuller September a, 1018.
Schmidt went quietly to the death
chamber, acoompanled by the princi
pal keeper and the Rev. Father Cashln,
the prison chaplain. Leaving the
death house, he said goodbye to those
who remained.
When he entered the ohamber, the
guards attempted to direct him
toward the chair but Schmidt gentbr
shook them off and Insisted on ad
dressing the seventeen witnesses. The
guards desisted from their efforts and
with Father Cashln standing at one
side and the keeper at the other,
Schmidt saldt
"Gentlemen, I ask forgiveness of all
those I have Injured or scandalized.
I forgiv.e all those who have injured
me. My last wish Is to say goodbye
to my dear old mother."
Schmidt then seated himself In the
electric chair and the current was ap
plied three times. Within a minute
he was dead. He had spent the night
up to midnight in praying and talk
ing with Father Cashln, and slept
from midnight to 6 o'clock, when he
was awakened for breakfast. He
would take only a oup of coffee.
GOOD DETECTIVE WORK.
New York, Feb. 18.—When the tor
so of Anna Aumuller*s body
was
wash­
ed up on the New Jersey shore of the
Hudson river there started a search
which has had but few parallels in
the annals of New York crime. There
waB
but one faint clue, a pillowslip
on which was embroidered the letter
"A," but It was Just such a pillowslip
as might be found in hundreds of
homes or stores. There was not even
laundry mark to aid the police. With
this slender clue, Inspector Faurot
took personal charge of the case and
on September 14, 1918, twelve days
after the murder, Hans Schmidt, an
assistant priest at an uptown church,
was arrested, charged with the crime.
An hour before the arrest the inspec
tor had broken into a flat and found
a long bladed butcher's knife and oth
er evidence that the murder had been
committed there. Schmidt confessed
and his sole defense waB that it was a
"blood sacrifice murder."
The body had been dismembered
and presumably all of it was thrown
into the river, although the head was
never found. Schmidt was twice plac
ed on trial, the first jury, in Decem
ber, 1913, failing to reach a verdict.
In February, 1914, he was found guil
ty.
Besides the sordid story of Anna
Aumuller's Infatuation for Schmidt,
the trials revealed that his was a
career of crime. He was engaged in
a counterfeiting scheme at the time
the murder was committeed, and
"Dr." A. Muret, who posed as a den
tist, was sent to prison for seven
years as Schmidt's accomplice In the
latter's scheme. It was found that
Schmidt also had posed as a physi
cian, that he had committed numerous
forgeries and had been guilty of other
frauds. His attorneys pleaded their
client was insane. The slayer, how
ever, always contended that he was
sane. He took no active part in his
own defense. When he was sentenc
ed he thanked the court and express
ed a desire to be executed at once.
He maintained the same stolid com
posure through all the various
of his case.

WOMMII SHYER
GIVEN SENTENCE
8IXTY YEAR OLD DEFENDANT IN
WINTERSET MURDER CASE
MUST GO TO PRISON.
Winterset, Feb. 18.—Sixteen years
In the penitentiary was the sentence
given today by District Judge Apple
gate to Mrs. Ida Meyer, the 60 year old
woman who earlier in the week was
convicted of oomplicity in the murder
of her daughter-in-law, Mrs. Ethel
Meydr, last July.
Counsel for Mrs. Meyer had peti
tioned for a new trial, but this was
overruled by Judge Applegate. Mrs.
Meyer appeared composed when sen
tence was pronounced. She made a
short statement to the court in which
she emphatically denied that she or
her son, Fred, had been implicated in
the murder.
The heavy sentence was a surprise
to Mrs. Meyer's friends. Fred Meyer,
her son and husband of the slain
woman, was convicted last December
on a similar charge but was sentenced
to only fifteen years, the minimum un
der the law. Fred Meyer and his
wife were married just one year ago
today.
Counsel fot Mrs. Meyer did not in
timate whether they would appeal the
case to the higher courts, where the
