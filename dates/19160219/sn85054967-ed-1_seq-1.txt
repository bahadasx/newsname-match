Co, last Friday afternoon, was the

years in the bituminous coal dis
trict. Twenty-seven employes lost
their lives and five injured, are
now in the Indiana hospital. Bo
dies of nineteen miners were tak
en from the mine early Satur

Seven other were taken out of the

ana, making a total of 27 bodies.

Investigation of the accident by

Mine Inspectors Thomas Lowther.
of this place, and C. 11. Crocker,
of Blairsville, showed that Fire
Boss Charles Strandqust and Aline
Foreman William Ball lost their
lives while making the second gas
test of the day in the mine. Two
examinations of the mine are
made daily. The lirst was complet
ed at 11 o'clock Friday morning
and the second test was nearly fin
ished when the explosion occurred,
killing all of the company men en
gaged in making the test.
The seat of the explosion was
the fifteenth right room of head
ing 3 and 4, about a mile and a
quarter from the entrance. Ordin
arily 43 men worked in this sec
tion, but on account of the funeral
of one of the crew held in Indiana
that day only 30 miners were at
work in the room, which lessened
the loss of life, as every man on
duty in the vicinity of the explo
sion was killed instantly. The three
injured miners in the local hospi
tal were some distance from the
heading when the let-go occurred.
B. AI. Clark, of Punxsutawney,
assistant to President Lucius AY.
Robinson, said that half a dozen
theories as to the cause of the ex
plosion might be advanced, any
of which might be correct, but that
it is doubtful if investigation, as
(borough as it will' be, will ever
reveal the real cause of the disas-
ter. The mine has a tendency to
be gaseous at times, and for this
reason extra precautions have al
ways been taken in regard to the
daily test for gas.
The Jefferson and Clearfield
Coal and Iron Company, with its
allied interests, did not take out
regular compensation, preferring
to conduct an insurance system of
its own. Attorney Henry I. Wil
son, of Big Run, who has charge
of the concern's compensation
work, was here conferring with
the officials in regard to adjusting
the compensation. In commenting
on this phase of the accident Air.
AVilson said the disaster will cost
the company between $50,000 and
$60,000 in compensations.
The greater number of the dead
were buried in St. Bernard's Ro
man Catholic cemetery Alonday.
An explosion occurred in the
same mine six years ago, at which
time 11 men lost their lives.
Coal Company Exonerated.
The Jefferson & Clearfield Coal
& Iron Co. in whose mine at Er
nest the disastrous explosion oc
curred last Friday evening, was
exonerated from all blame con
nected therewith by the coroner's
jury, which conducted the inquest
AA"ednesday afternoon, with Coro
ner Dr. 11. B. Buterbaugh presid
ing.
The jury; also determined that
the explosion was due to an un
known cause. The text of the ver

Train Citizens
For the Navy
As Many as 2,500 Ca" Cruise in
Warships for $3O Each.
AVashington, D. C., Feb. 17—
Secretary Daniels decided today
to inaugurate a system of eifiJ/nn
r.aval training similar to that on
which military training camps
have been established at Platts
burg and elsewhere| It is planned
to use six battleships to take 2,-
500, if that many present them
selves, for training for a month's
cruise, beginning about August 15.
The plan, which was drafted by
Assistant Secretary Roosevelt, pro-
I oses that the cost to the mem
shall be sufficiently low, not ex
ceeding $3O each, to enable those
in moderate circumstances to join..
The only compulsory requirement
is that each volunteer declare his
intention of giving his services to
the navy in case of war.
The object of the plan is to es
tablish a naval reserve of vivilians
