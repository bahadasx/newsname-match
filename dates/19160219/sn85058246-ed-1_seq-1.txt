tion. Others Supported for, the
I Position.
Dr. Elmer G. Peterson, director
of tho Extension Division of tho Utah
Agrlclturnt Collcgo will succeod Dr.
John A. Wldtaoo as president of tho
Institution, his election having boon
mado on Thursday when tho College
Board of Trustees met at tho Hotel
Utah nnd settled tho question of the
presidency which has created state
wide Interest.
Dr. Peterson was pitted against
como of tho best educators In the
state of Utah for tho position, among
tho candidates being Dr. Gcorgo
Thomas who Is not only known for
his work on tho faculty of the U. A.
C. but also as president of the school
) board of Logan City nnd a member
of tho Utah Educational Association
over which he at ono time presided;
iDr. F. S. Harris, Dr. Frank West,
and Dr. Joseph F. Merrill head of
tho engineering department of tho
University of Utah. A number of
ballots were taken but on tho final
ballot all tho trustees voted for Dr.
Teterson therefore making his elec
tion unanimous. s
Lorenzo N. Stohl; chairman of tho
board, supportod tho candidacy of
Dr. Potorson; David MattBon, secro
I tary of state supported Dr. George
Thomas, while John Dem lod those
who Indorsed Joseph F. Merrill.
Tho salary of Dr. Potorson was
fixed at MOOO.
It was thought best by Lorenzo N.
Stohl, chairman of tho board, that
no nominations bo made, so that tho
selection of a president might not
be considered In tho light of a con
test. Before formally opening tho
meeting ho declared to tho board
that in all mattors affecting the col
lego the trustees had, been unani
mous and he thought tho board
should be unanimous In the solectlon
of a now president.
Each trusteo was given plenty of
tlmo to set out tho qualifications of
the man each favored for head of
the collcgo. Thus all candidates wero
discussed at length before a ballot
was taken.
Mattson Favors Dr. Thomas
David Mattson, secretary 'of state
and exofflclo member of tho board,
paid a high tribute to all' of the
candidates, but said ho favored Dr.
George Thomas, regarding Kim emi
nently fitted to bo president of tho
Agricultural Collcgo. Ho also prais
ed Dr. Peterson and the work which
ho has dono In tho extension depart
ment. Mr. Mattson supported the candi
dacy of Dr. Thomas until tho last
ballot..
Lorenzo N. Stohl, Georgo T. Odoll
and Joseph Qulnnoy Jr., supported
the candidacy of Dr. Potorson. They
explained his work ns a professor at
tho collcgo and ns head of tho ex
tension department. Emphasis was
laid on tho fact that tho work in
hlch ho has been engaged has car
ried him to every part of tho state,
and as one of his supporters express
ed It, "to ovory home." Thoso wfio
favored Dr. Potorson considered him
moro familiar with conditions in the
tho stato and with tho needs of tho
JR college than any" other candidate.
3 Dern Backs Dr. Merrill
H&9 Tho work of Prof. Josoph F. Mor
f ' rill as head, of tho engineering depart
I ment of tho stated university, his ac-
I qualntanceship throughout tho stato
I and his kuowlodgo of educational af
fairs generally itt Utah, wore urgod
by John Dern ns worthy of consld-
eratlon by tho board, Mr. Dern do-
clared ho bollqve Prof. Morrill was
in a position to appreclato the needs
of tho school 'i well as any man In
tao stato,
Doth Dr. Harris and Dr. West
ere highly praised for their work
l thQ collego and both Trecelved
b In tho ballqUng. But oftor tho
fourth ballot and It was seen by the
supporters of candidates other than
Dr. Peterson, that moro than n ma
jority of the board woro In favor of
electing him, votes for scattering
candidates fell off. Dr. Peterson and
Dr. Thomas were tho only candidates
oted for on tho fifth ballot and on"
tho last ballot all tho trustees voted
for Dr. Peterson.
One trusteo said after tho meeting
that no limit was placed on tho num
ber of ballots In order to give all on
opportunity to cast complimentary
votes for candidates.
Satisfied With Cholco
"Tho trustees feel they havo select
ed n good president," said Mr. Stohl
speaking for tho board. "We extend
to Dr. Peterson all our support nnd
ho will find that the trustees of tho

board supported Dr. Wldtsoo unani
mously In everything ho did. That
same support will bo given Dr. Pet
