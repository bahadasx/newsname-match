OFFICIAL NEWS OF CITY AND COUNTY
Preparedness is the great topic
of conversation, of magazine dis
cussion, nnd of newspaper head
ings. Man by name of Wilson
seems to have made it so.
Preparedness has been urged
for years by munitions makers,
powder trusts, armor plate fac
tories, and the like. And the
country's army and navy experts
have advised preparedness. And
the country has spent vast sums
of money for preparedness. Yet
when President Wilson became
president, he found this country
sadly lacking in preparedness.
Millions of dollars have been
spent annually under the various
administrations, but a careful
check of expenditure reveals the
fact that only about one-third
value was ever received from its
expenditures. Armor plate man
ufacturers, battleship builders,
munitions plants, etc., all received
big prices on special contracts let
by friendly officials, and the coun
try barely maintained what it had,
without seeming to add to its pre
paredness.
Now the country is aroused by
the speeohes of its president to
the fact that we arc not well pre
pared to meet invasions, or to pro
tect our rights on the waters, or
the lives of our citizens in other
countries. Mr. Bryan and some
of his followers are opposed to
preparedness. Mr. Wilson and
his administration, together with
the leading republicans and pro
gressives, favor greater prepared
ness. The question is as to the
details of the plan, and how the
money shall be raised.
The opinion of the Examiner
has not yet been solicited from the
oresident, probably because of
his dense ignorance as to the
standing of the Examiner in this
nation. But we do not feel of
fended.
The Examiner favors prepared
ness by having the strongest navy
in the world, the best coast de
fense in the world, and a system
whereby those who yell for war
shall be the first ones called to
war—and be made to serve.
"We believe in spending the
same amount of money as in the
past, but in getting full value
from this money, which plan in a
few years would of itself put us
In front rank in the world. Gov
ernment operation of factories and
shipbuilding plants would largely
solve the problem of getting value
for moneys spent, and would also
save this country from wars or
entanglements engineered by pri
vate munitions makers, for with
their graft gone, they would have
little interest in seeing cannons
used.
We believe in taxing the wealth
of the country instead of labor.
England has only half our popu
lation and wealth, yet taxes in
comes three times as much as the
I'nited States. England collects
45 per cent of her total revenues
from wealth, incomes and inheri
tances, while the United States
gets but 9 per cent in this man
ner.
Take the war business out of
politics and out of reach of per
sonal profit, anrl not only Bryan's
dream of peace but this country's
demand for preparedness will !><■
solved. Bryan is all right in his
peace ideas, but he looks ahead
to what we ought to be, and for
the moment overlooks the fact
that we are yet tainted with the
blood of savagery and like fight
ing jis a pastime when not eat
ng, When the human leeches
are still sucking money from the
people by inciting wars to sell
munitions, or protect oil plants
in .Mexico, or get concessions in
Europe and Asia, the first step
is to shake off the leeches in our
own country, then protect our
shores from those of other coun
tries, and then give thought to
peace for future generations.
The nomination of Louis Brau
deis to become a member of the
U. S. supreme court shows the
churauter of President Wilson,
and the opposition which has
arisen against the confirmation
distinctly marks the character of
hi* opponents.
Brandeis is a man of the peo
ple. His life work has beeii for
the masses of the people. His
name was made in fighting illegal
combinations in restraint of trade,
in breaking monstrous trusts that
pooled ownings and raised prices,
in protecting the public against
the aggression of finance. He is
a Jew, with a heart for the com
mon people. He is opposed by
I In' Qentiles of Wall street and
their parasitic friends scattered
in the cities of the country.
There is fear in Wall street in
neeing such a man named on the
highest tribunal of this nation.
There were plenty of men sug
gested for the appointment, who
would have been satisfactory to
l>ig business. Yet Wilsou named
lii'andeis, because Brandeis is a
real man, capable, unafraid, stand
ing for popular rights in this sup
posedly free country. Wilson is
not afraid of race lines, but looks
to the man himself.
Wat cli those who oppose Bran
ilcis. They will bear watching.
It is announced that the pro
gressive state convention will be
held at Seattle May 4. for the He
lection of delegates to the nation
al progressive convention to tie
held in Chicago.
The republican stale convention
will lie held at North Yakima May
(i. to select 14 delegates to the na
tional republican convention to
be held in Chicago. The date set
tor county conventions is April
29, Stevens county republicans be
ing entitled to 15 delegates.
The date of the democratic
state convention has not been set,
but it is probable that Spokane
will be the place.
Armor plate manufacturers
have notified the senate naval
committee that they will raise the
price of armor plate $200 a ton
if congress decides to operate gov
ernment armor plate factories.
The senate committee, however,
has a democratic majority, and in
spite of the threat, voted to recom
mend government plants.
The position of President Wil
son and the democratic leadership
in congress in thus favoring gov
ernment manufacture of muni
tions is likely to put them in bad
with the big steel interests, and
we may soon expect a broadside
of publicity showing what a fatal
mistake it is to have such men
in charge of public affairs.
Congressman Dill has announc
ed publicly that he favors pre
paredness of a sane character—a
preparedness which would enable
this country to protect itself from
any invasion. He believes in
strengthening the navy and the
••oast artillery, and in increasing
the strength of the national guard.
His position is the same as it was
before election, and is in full ac
cord with the president's position,
notwithstanding the misquota
tions which have been made as to
his views.
However, Mr. Dill has stated
over his signature that he will op
poaj any revenue bill to raise
money for the big increases pro
posed in army and navy that does
not raise that revenue from the
wealth of the country, particular
ly from large incomes, large in
heritances, and if possible, from
the manufacturers of munitions,
lie is opposed to stamp taxes, and
will not vote to tax the poor to
protect the rich.
Good for Dill. Bran after as
sociating with the plutcs and the
agents of big interests at the na
tional capital, he hasn't forgotten
that he was sent to Washington
$1 Year in Advance; 5c Copy
by the common people to look af
ter the interests of the common
people.
