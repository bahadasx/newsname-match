HIGH COURT BULWARK
OF PROPERTY RIGHTS
Boston Lawyer Will Bring Peo­
ple's Views to Nation's Great
Tribunal.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 17.—The most
interesting thing about the storm of
opposition to Louis D. Brandeis' ap­
pointment to the supreme court is the
way it has shown up that august body
as the guardian and protector of priv­
ilege and the established order.
President Wilson could have ap­
pointed Brandeis to any other position
in the government without throwing
Wall street into spasms. As it is, we
are frankly told that the supreme
court is the bulwark of property.
"Hands off!" say the sons of priv
liege. 'The supreme court is our prop
erty. So long as you don't touch the
supreme court, shout all you please
about justice and industrial democ
racy and equality of opportunity. We
don't mind if you even elect a gov
ernor or a legislature now and then.
With the supreme court on duty,
they can't do much. But if you put
a man like Brandeis on the supreme
court, what-assurance have we that
our sons and daughters may not some
day have to work for a living?"
Brandeis Hits Hard.
Here are three very illuminating
quotations. The first two are from
the speeches and writings of Louis
D. Brandeis, and the third is from
the Wall street news of the New York
Times.
Said Brendeis on Jan. 13, 1912:
Under the guise of protecting
American labor, J. P. Morgan and
the management of the United
Steel Steel corporation not only
employ armies of poor, ignorant
foreigners, but, after grinding
their faces in a manner not per­
mitted in any other civilized
country, throw them at the age
of 40 years—old men—upon the
scrap heap.
yQiUSfoflalT- UU 3. hft
Politically, every American is
ee and independent industrially,
large portion of Americans are
dependent upon the arbitrary
will of others. None of our cou
trasts is more marked than that
between our political liberty and
our industrial absolutism.
Now for the Wall street reporter of
the New York Times, writing in the
Times on the morning after Brandeis'
appointment:
When the tickers yesterday an­
nounced his choice to succeed
Justice Lamar on the supreme
court the groan that arose sound­
ed like the echo of a great na­
tional disaster. Brokers on the
floor of the exchange professed
to believe that a ghastly joke had
been perpetuated by the ticker.
Here is a fourth quotation, too good
to neglect. It is from the indignant
letter of one Alexander Sidney Lanier,
in which he tries to express his out­
raged feelings to the editor of the New
York Times. SSiys Lanier:
"The supreme court has always
been justly regarded by our people as
the bulwark of their property rights
and the safeguard of their liberties.
His appointment is bo astonishing
that it seem* like a horrid nightmare,
and his confirmation by the senate
would, I verily believe, make every
responsible citizen feel insecure in his
personal liberty and personal rights.
With the great unrest that is now
prevalent, this would seem, of all
others, the most inopportune time for
weakening the influence of this august
tribunal."
And so forth and so on.
TOO MUCH "WORK OX FLAGMAN.
CHICAGO, Feb. 17.—A coroner's
Jury condemned the inefficient flag­
ging system of the Chicago & North­
western railway. Witnesses testified
that at the time of a fatal accident
the flagman at the crossing was work­
ing at a pumping station nearby.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 17.—Labor's
suspicion and dislike of so-called
"preparedness" was voiced before the
August senate committee on Military
Affairs in Washington on Feb. 8 by
Pres. James H. 'Maurer of the Penn­
sylvania State Federation of Labor,
•whose speech at that time was prob­
ably unlike anything ever heard in
that particular committee room be­
fore. The senators who were gath­
ered around the mahogany table fore
bore to heckle the speaker as they
had heckled several of the "pacifists."
Apparently they felt there was too
much of the bear about him to make
an encounter agreeable.
The hearing was held under the
auspices of the Anti "Preparedness"
committee which has opened head­
quarters in the MunBey building,
Washington, D. C., for a fight against
the "preparedness" hobby.
Mr. Maurer, after explaining that
while the Pennsylvania Federation of
I.«abor had not taken any official ac­
tion against "preparedness" he knew
THE
Four Railroad Brotherhood Exec­
utives Make Joint Public State­
ment On Demands.
TAKE STRONG STAND
FOR 8-HOUR WORK DAT
Long Hours of Labor and Stren­
uous Work Age Railroad
Workers Prematurely.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 17.—In their
first official statement on the subject
the four railroad brotherhoods have
made dear their position on their re­
quest for an eight-hour day for rail­
road employes.
The statement emphasizes that the
men -are asking for a shorter work
day, not for more money.
"If tho railroads insist on a longer
clay," says the statement, "then it will
mean
5
icreased pay."
ilnil Men Noncommittal.
The railroad organizations decline
to commit themselves on the question
of arbitration, in the event the rail­
roads refuse the demand and risk a
strike. The position of the organiza­
tions ?s thus stated:
"They are not opposed to arbitra­
tion, neither are they pledged to ac­
cept it.
"They are practically pledged to
peace, but that does not mean peace
at any price.
"It neans peace with honor, and
not peace at the sacrifice of justice."
The statement is signed by W. S.
Stone, prrar-d chief engineer. Brother­
hood of Locomotive Engineers W. 8.
Carter, president. Brotherhood of Lo­
comotive Firemen and Engineers L.
E. Sheppard, acting president, Order
of Railway Conductors, and W. G.
Lee, president. Brotherhood of Rail­
road Trainmen.
Based on Justice.
The statement replies to an an­
nouncement given out by the execu­
tive committee of the association of
Western Railways, Feb. 1. It is
headed: "Why the Eight-hour Day,"
and says in part:
"The eight-hour day movement is
based vholly upon the justice of a
workday of reasonable hours that will
permit- the men further "to" separate
the deadline between work and
wages.
"The railroads say in effect that
men who have put in a few years of
railroad service have worked them­
selves out and will not be accepted if
they lose their positions.
"If men are worked out in a few
years under present service condi­
tions, ha demand to extend their
wage earning years is fully justified.
Can't Make Mileage.
"Overtime in road service is due al­
most wholly to the practice of rail­
roads in overloading trains so that
they can not make their mileage
within their time limits.
"The railroads are doing this for
profit. They do not deny it, and if
they purpose to demand extra service
at the sacrifice of the health and fu­
ture earning ability of the men, they
should pay extra for it.
"The pay of train service employes,
other than passenger, is based on 100
miles or less, 10 hours or less.
"In eastern territory the brakeman
will receive $2.67 for regular freight
service, out of which he must sustain
his family at home and take care of
himself at the other end of the run.
100 Miles Day's Work.
"The 100-mile trip is what repre­
sents one day's work, and means that
at its expiration the man must lay
away from home until he is dead­
headed back or returned back with a
train.
"The conductors receive approxi­
mately one-third more than the
brakemen.
"In southern and western territories
wages are a trifle higher.
"That there is not so much justifi­
cation for the contention of the rail­
roads that the eight-hour day is im­
possible is proved by the fact that at
present there are seven roads in the
southeastern which pay overtime on a
basis of 11 miles per hour.

in the western territory pay overtime

that the working class as a whole in
Pennsylvania was bitterly opposed to
it, went on to give his5 reasons. His
speech in part was as follows
Why a Stampede?
"Our first reason, gentlemen, for
opposing this stampede is that we can
not see the use of it. We feel that in­
stead of spending any more money for
the army and navy, we think it would
be patriotic on the part of congress
to investigate the places that have
been -absorbing the money spent In
the last ten years for 'preparedness.'
"Up to a few months ago the
American people were told that they
were 'prepared' to lick all creation.
Ten months ago intervention of Mexi­
co was talked of—apparently we were
•prepared' for Mexico. When the Lu
sitania was sunk, the newspapers
talked about our going to war with
Germany. In fact the newspapers
contended that we could get away
with Mexico and Germany at the
same time if we saw fit.
"And now when the bottom drops
Mayor Prince and Commissioners Voss and Silber
stein have at last come clean on the referendum proposi­
tion. They declare that .they will not stand out on
technical objections to the alleged irregularites in the
certification of several of the petitions.
"If a sufficient number of qualified electors have
signed the petition we will offer no objection to sub­
mitting the armory ordinance to the people," said one
of the commissioners. That is the right spirit.
Now the Shriners would do the right thing if they
came across as gracefully as the commissioners. It will
not help the situation any by fighting off the referen­
dum election in the courts. Every such move only
makes new friends for the advocates of the proposition
to save the armory for the people. There will always
be a sore spot if the armory is sold without the consent
of the people.
We don't know very much about the proceedings of
last Saturday in Judge Dancer's court. They were kept
exceedingly quiet. The daily papers stated that no hear­
ing would be held, as Saturday was a legal holiday, and
believing this to be the case the referendum petitioners
made no effort to intervene in support of the their
claims, although they planned to be represented at the
hearing.
The proceedings were conducted so quietly that
scarcely any of the court assistants seemed to know
anything about them. The News Tribune went to press
Sunday and Monday without learning that a hearing
had been held, and not until the Herald appeared on
the streets Monday evening were the people let in on it.
Judge Dancer's decision is expected daily. It is a
foregone conclusion that he will be fair. The peti­
tioners do not want the best of it. We merely ask for
a square deal. We have made an honest effort to fol­
low the provisions of the city charter. The names of
nearly 2,000 qualified electors have been secured this
is considerably more than ten- per cent of the legal
voters of the city, and every portion of the petition was
honestly certified to. There may have been a few minor
details overlooked, but no error was made intentionally.
We simply did not know in advance just how the city
attorney would rule on certain requirements of the
charter of doubtful construction. In such cases the peti­
tioners should be given the benefit of the doubt.
A remarkable feature of the petition is in the fact
that not one cent was expended to secure signatures.

feel that we are not so poorly

"Frankly, we feel that the muni­

DULUTH AND SUPERIOR, FEBRUARY 19,1916.
COMMISSIONERS FINALLY AGREE TO OFFER
Penniless Plymouth Strikers Are
Given Starvation Wages and
Make Protest.
PLYMOUTH, Mass., Feb. 17.—Pen­
niless and getting deeper into debt
every day for the necessities of life,
with only the prospect of supplies ar­
riving from friendly organizations in
Boston, the strikers cf the Plymouth
Cordage company are standing firmly
on their demands. They ask an in­
crease from $9 to $12 for the men
and from $8 to $11 for the women
and minors.
Less than 50 employes of the com­
pany answered the morning whistle
to work, this number including fore
men and office employes. Orderly
numbers of strikers parade In front
of the work before opening time, dur­
ing the noon hour and again at quit­
ting time. Beyond occasional bursts
of shouting there is absolutely nothing
that even the police can call dis
ordeply.
Professor Guidagno of Boston is in
charge of the strike. The strikers
are confident of victory, for the plant
is almost completely tied up and the
company must soon come to terms,
it is thought.
DEMAND WAGE INCRASE.
NEW YORK, Feb. 17.—The Em­
broidery Workers' union presented the
following demands to employers: A
53-hour week, wage increases, union
recognition, committee to adjust shop
grievances and a board of arbitration^
Practically every shop in this city is
closed because of the strike to en­
force the schedule.
now when they are so sunk in debt
that some people fear that they can
never pay the interest on what they
owe, with their population reduced
to cripples, women and children, when
they are bleeding to death, now you
say we have got to be afraid of them.
It don't look good to me,

No persons were asked to take out petitions, neither
were any voters urged to sign them. Most of the sign­
ers regarded it as a privilege to place their names on
the petitions, and they came forth without being asked.
If a systematic campaign had been made the names of
more than 50 per cent of the qualified electors could
have been secured to petitions. Of this there is no
doubt.
In so much as the armory ordinance is to go to the
people they should know now that the special election
will not be called for this purpose, alone. Several
amendments to the city charter are nearly ready to be
presented to the voters, and the armory ordinance can
be voted upon at the same time without any material
increase in the expense of holding an election. The
small additional expensfe will represent the short time it
will require the judges and clerks of election to count
the ballots. So the matter of the expense of an elec­
tion does not enter into the question.
The voters are assured in advance that so far as The
il^abor World is concerned a clean campaign will be
waged to save the armory for the people. We will do
our level-best to carry our message to the electors. If
we can reach them there will be no question about the
result.
If the people vote to save the armory the commis­
sioners will be made to know at the same time that
the mandate is for the greatest possible publio use of
the building. To keep in .good standing with the ma­
jority sentiment of the city they will lose no time in
making the necessary repairs arid alterations, and fur­
nishing the proper equipment, for a great civic center
from which many good things will radiate throughout
the city. Instead of making dollars from the sale of
the building the commissioners will be more concerned
•in making men.
This is the biggest thing the people of Duluth ever
tackled. Its possibilities are limitless. The few dol­
lars to be expended in the initial cost, for maintenance
and management, will be nothing compared with the
returns in a better quality of citizenship. .We expect
"every honest, forward-looking man and woman in Du­
luth who is free from prejudice and other ties to join
in the campaign, not only to save the armory for the
people, but to insist that it be made a great civic center
at the earliest moment. /,

Fuel.
PHILADELPHIA, Feb. 17.—The
anthracite coal industry is operating
on as low a margin of profit as is pos­
sible if the operators are to continue
serving the public, according to a
statement issued today through the
operators* executive committee, point­
ing out what a 20 per cent increase to
the miners would mean.
A table of costs in coal production
accompanying the committee's state­
ment gave the mine owners' profit as
20 cents per ton on anthracite coal, re­
tailing at $7.25 in New York. Other
costs, according to the committee, are
retailing, $2il5 transportation, $1.55
losses on sides of coal which must be
sold at less than cost of production in
competition with sof-t coal producers,
95 cents production cost, including
labor, depreciation, equipment, royal­
ties and taxes $_2,40 a ton.
"Among other demands," said the
committee, "the miners are asking for
a 20 per cent Increase in wages. This
would cost the industry $23,000,000
a year, more than twice the annual
profit from the industry."

Fake Rural Credits Measure May
Pass the House of Repre­
sentatives.
TENANT FARMER HAS
NO CHANCE TO BORROW
Will Be Denied Relief for Another
Generation Unless Bill Is
Amended.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 17.—A fake
rural credits bill, known as the Moss
Rural Credits Bill, will be put through
the House of Representatives of Con­
gress very soon—perhaps this week—
unless *.he farmers and trades union
members and other working people
protest to their representatives
against it.
It is time to wake up to this dan­
ger.
Real rural credits legislation is a
vital naed of this period. Land mo­
nopoly is developing beyond all
bounds. There are hundreds of thou­
sands of tenant farmers and farmers
who are mortgaged to death or can­
not get credit.
Neither Land Nor Credit.
There are great numbers of people
of the cities who need to have access
to the land. But they cannot get land
and they cannot get credit.
The private banking monopoly
stands between- these industrious
workers and their chance to make a
living Jn the production of the food
that is necessary to us all.
The Moss Bill for so-called Rural
Credits is a bankers' bill. It is to
benefit investors, like insurance, trust
companies, etc., who want the govern­
ment to guarantee their investments
and exempt them from taxation, as
this proposed fake bill does.
Wall Street Backs It.
The National City Bank of New
York, the immense Rockefeller finan­
cial institution, indorses this bill and
urges its passage. In its February
bulletin the National City Bank de­
fends ihe private bankers' control of
all loans and credits. But it is candid
enough to let the cat out of the bag
in the closing paragraphs of its re­
view of the bilL It says:
"The plan is. for the most part, an
ingenious Adaptation of the Federal
Reserve System. Probably
the most frequent comment made
upon it will be that a man who is
able to own a farm subject to no
greater encumbrance than this plan
allows will be able to get along with­
out the system. Certainly this is true
in many parts of the country,- but
there 5s testimony that in many other
localities it will reduce rates. Cer­
tainly, this general plan will facilitate
the movement of capital into and out
of mortgage investments.
Tenant Farmer Out of It.
"As :o the tenant farmer, now fi­
nanced by the landlord and local mer­
chant, whose needs have been the text
for most,of the appeals for a system
of rural credits, he is outside the pro­
visions of this measure,"
This is a conservative enough ad­
mission of the deformities of the bill.
But it iets the cat out of the bag just
the same.
The very prosperous farmer who
owns a productive farm with very
little or no mortgage against it may
get a somewhat smaller rate of inter­
est by the terms of this bill. Land
may go up in value through a land
monopoly that the bankers' monopoly
is trying to increase by this "joker"
legislation, thus making it all the
more difficult for the poor man to
make a living from the land.
Denied Real Rural Credits.
But the average farmer who nepds
a chattel loan, who wants loans on his
crops, otc., the tenant farmer and city
worker, who wants a chance to put
unproductive and unused land into
production and use, these tillers and
toilers will get no benefit whatever
from this law if it becomes a law. On
the contrary, they will be denied for
another generation the relief they are
entitled to. They will be denied real
rural credits legislation Which would
give them real borrowers* right and
set their industry and enterprise free.

"But I'll tell you the real reason
for 'preparedness'. The American cap­
italists are financing the European
war they are supplying the muni­
tions of war and the methods of de­
struction. They are not selling for
cash but on credit. Millions of dol­
lars are today bought with pieces of
paper with crooked marks on it, pro­
missory notes, and the banking in­
terests are furnishing money to the
manufacturers so they can pay wages
and buy supplies. These promises to
pay are piling up higher and higher.
Some day there will be an end to this
European war and then over there in
Europe they will get around a table—
it's a'pity they didn't get around a
table before the war broke out and
then they will discuss the question of
settlement.'

BILL ON UNIVERSAL
SERVICE EXPLAINEb
Would Mean 8,000,000 Men
Capable of Answering Call
to Arms.
About the only choice a nation has
in these days is to get a big army of
hired men, get a big citizen army, or
stand the risk of being smashed up,
declares Charles Edward Russell, the
well known Socialist.
"The Swiss and the Australians
chose to have the citizen army in the
name of democracy.
"We can have in the United States
all the great benefits of the Swiss and
Australian systems if congress will
pass the bill introduced by Senator
Chamberlain of Oregon, senate bill
1695.
"All the able-bodied male Amer­
icans, except those exempted, under
certain conditions, because of relig­
ious croed, are made subject to mili­
tary training from their twelfth year
to their twenty-fourth. Then, without
further training, they become mem­
bers of the citizen army reserves.
What It Means To a Boy.
"A normal, average American boy
would then go through these exper­
iences:
At 12 he would become automati­
cally a member of the citizens' cadet
corps, in which he would continue six
years, passing through three divisions.
From 12 to 14, in the first division,
he would be trained in calisthenics,
physical development, ajid military
exercises without arms, for at least
ninety hours a year, at his chool or
in an organization like the boy scouts.
At 14 his second division training
would ^include the rifle and target in
galleries, again not. less than ninety
hours a year.
At 16 he would enter the third di­
vision, and have, in addition to ninety
hours other drilling, ten whole days
in camp with field exercises and tar­
get practice. In these two divisions lie
would have a uniform.
A.t 18 he would become a member
of the citizen army, and every year
for six years would have not less than
120 hours of drilling, of which at least
ten who days must be in camp.
At 24 he would become a member
of the citizen reserves.
Could Enter Navy.
"If h-3 preferred at the beginning td
enter navy, that would be ar­
ranged, training on shipboard being
substituted for ,the camps.
"The bill provides that youth that
do not tyke the required training shall
be liable to fines and imprisonment,
and employers are stringently forbid­
den to interfere with or hamper the
training of their employes. Persons
of bad moral character are excluded
and intoxicating liquor is ruled out.
"The citizen army and navy do not
take the places of the regular army
and navyj but are to be added to the
regular forces in time of war. The
president can mobilize the citizen
army and navy, when they pass at
once into the regular service. When
they are training they receive ho pay
when in regular service they get the
pay of regulars.
By Congressional Districts.
"Every congressional district is
made a training district in charge of
an officer of the regular army, and
from fho start the training is under
the charge of the war department.
"The president is to appoint officers
of the citizen army, citizen navy and
reserves, but under regulations as to
examinations, record for efficiency
and promotion, so that service as offi­
cers shall be open to all.
"The only other plan now offered
for national defense is the continental
army •ehome of the war department,
now being urged upon congress. It
would give us eventually about 400,
000 men at an enormous expertse.
Means 8,000-000 Men.
