AVIATION IN ARMY
COMES UNDER FIRE
Investigation of Charges Is
Ordered by the War
Department.
SENATOR ROBINSON SAYS
PUBLIC HAS BEEN FOOLED
Asserts There Has Been a Deliberate
Attempt to Cover Up
Inefficiency.
An army investigation of
charges by Senator Robinson that
Lieut. Col. Reber, head of the
aviation service, lias been con-j
ducting the aero corps in an inefficient
manner, has been ordered
by the War Department. A
board, which includes the inspector
general and the adjutant general
of Ale army and the head of
the War College, will conduct the
inquiry.
Congressional investigation of the
army aviation service was regarded as
a strong possibility at the Capitol today.
An investigation is proposed in a
resolution by Senator Robinson of Arkansas,
in support of which he made
sensational charges before the Senate
military affairs committee yesterday
against the service involving defective
% equipment, favoritism to certain officers
and general inefficiency.
Action on the resolution will be
taken by^the committee Monday. Chairman
Chamberlain said today he fa*?"
invoBtio-atiftn and iidrlod that
he believed the committee would favorably
report the resolution.
Senator Robinson told the committee
yesterday that the service was "contemptibly
inefficient" and that its head.
Lieut. Col. Samuel Reber, not only was
making no effort to improve it, but (
deliberately was preventing the facts
from reaching his superiors.
The senator appeared before the committee
with a mass of data, including
photographic copies of letters which
he said had been exchanged between
Col. Reber and Capt. Arthur S. Cowan, <
commanding the aviation station at San
l?iego. At least part of this evidence !
was produced before the court-martial
at San Francisco, which recently tried
Lieut. Col. Lewis E. Goodier, judge ad- '
vocate general of the western depart- r
ment, accused of improperly altering
certain charges filed by other officers
against Capt. Cowan.
r
Findings Before Commission. c
The findings of this court now are in r

army officers appointed by the acting
secretary of war to make a report to
President Wilson. The commission is
understood to be considering what ac- 1
tion should be taken as the result of 1
revelations during the trial concern- ]
ing Col. Iteber, Capt. Cowan and tfee
service generally, as well as the court's 1
decision as to Col. Goodier.
Senator Robinson read liberal ex- ,
cerpts from his photographs of letters, ,
and quoted Capt. Cowan as writing to ,
Col. Reber that if the service ever s
came under investigation by any one
outside the Signal Corps it would be ,
impossible to explain the "rotten way
in which the work has been handled."
Other letters were produced to ghow
that favoritism was practiced in the
promotion of men in the service.
The senator charged that Col. Reber
prompted Capt. Cowan to practice "contemptible
deceit" toward congressmen
who visited the aviation station, and
theft he attempted to get into the annual
appropriation bill in connection
with the item for the purchase of airships
a provision for the purchase of
"accessories" with which to buy automobiles.
He said the colonel wrote that "the
word "accessories' will be like charity,
and cover a multitude of.sin." Another
letter on which the senator dwelt in- I
intruded Capt. Cowan to have prepared
designs for sheets to be placed under
the s^ats of aviators "so we can say
ve have armored aeroplanes."
A letter presented to the committee purported
to be l'rom Col. Reber, head of the
service, to <'apt. Cowan, in charge at San
Diesro. under date of June '1, IS 15, and
read:
"! wish you would have your rogineertner
department get me out some drawings
for the size of sheets to be placed under
the scets of aviators for alleged armor
protection. I wili have several of these
plates made *o we can say we have armored
aeroolanes, not that I think it
vitally ewvtiiil. but in order that we
meet any charge that our machines are I
not armored."
Senator Robinson dc- ared that the defective
eor."iitio:? of equipment of the aviation
service at San l>iego could be established
beyond doubt. and thai Co!.
Reber had instructed '.'apt. Cowan to
keep it secret.
Warns Against Publicity.
Col. Reber wrote Cant- Cowan. Senator
Jlobu son said. June 21. 1915, saying: "J j
note in the weekly letter that a reference
la made to the condition of the machines
and motors. This information should not
bo made public."
T:> a letter of September 10, 1014, to
Cant. I'lar.t, Cap:. Cowan wrote:
"It will be understood that you will
not be required t?? fy in time of pence,
although nothing need be said about
this i;i the oit1? ial communication."
"As conclusive evidence that Col.
Tleber prompter Capt. Cowan to make
false reports concerning the true condition
of the service" said Senator
liooinson. "I quote from Ms letter of
February 1915, as follows:
'Ho < the chief?Gen. Scriven) will
probably ask you for the personnel of
the Is: Aero Squadron, and I suggest
that you have prepared a list showing
the officer? who?shall I say theoreti<
ally??belong to the same. If you
find it necessary to fill up by putting
in the names of some of the aviation
students, put them in c.nd give him a
list.
"In his letter of May 19. 1015," said
Sentvtfdr Hobinson. "Col. Keber cunning
ly suggests 10 vjapt. cowan to make a
false report, informing: him that the an. wy
which he had made previously to
certain inquiries was not the correct
one at all, and that he would find the
answer in Col. lichee's indorsement on
a letter of Otn. Murray, copy of which
v..iH iriclosei. Ke also said:
"'Sit tight a:.d say nothing: to no1
ody until the Inspector turns up. and
ihen answer his ciuestipnjs along the

Senator r.obiiiiiojj said he had photographic
copies of letters passing between
Col. Itcber and Gapt. Cowan;
showing favoritism to certain aviation
officers and. a purpose to demote others.

President Yuan Shi Kai mini- ?
mized the importance of the re- t!

pressed confidence in the ability

"This is no campaign, but only a skirnish,"
said Yuan Shi Kai, "but it gives

The president replied laughTftSfr to a et
emark regarding his excellent physical 02
rondition and good spirits, refuting ru- tc
mors of his ill health. Discussing his en- a
hronement, he said:
Enthronement Is Postponed.
"Although a date in February was sane- .
1 n
ioned, the enthronement could not take tj.
)lace because of the Yunnan rebellion, vi
vhich necessitated military operations, in
rherefore it was decided, with saddened B
learts, to postpone it/'
The president said the drafting of a
lew constitution would be begun in a few
lays. When it is finished the constitution 01
will go before a national convention for
suggestions. He did not predict the date
>f promulgation of the constitution. Dis- T
mussing its nature, he said : t;i
"We shall adopt from all countries
the provisions best suited to China, vl
without leaning toward any foreign s'
constitution." 01

As to Probable Recognition.

Yuan Shi Kai had this to say regard- fi
ing probable recognition of the monarchy:

the monarchy according to circurr.- I r<

Regarding China's position as affected o
by the war, the'president said: I w
"China lias made every effort to t
maintain'strict neutrality. The Chinese T
government is not aware that the en- v.
ter.te powers or the other belligerents tl
have made any substantial charges It
against us for not having done so. s(
China will endeavor to remain on

Yuan Shi iva.: then reverted to the I V,

"Yunnan and Kweichow have few ; y

"Mow soon ti:e rebellion will be crushed j ?

that it was easy for the rebels

While no news has been received of f'

there.

he Turks useless. Apparently th^
urks realized the fall of Krzerum
as inevitable and withdrew most of
lieir forces before the final onslaught,
aving the garrisons of the widely
eparated forts to their fate.
The campaign began to reach its clilax
in the last days of January. The
i oops of Gen. P , from the north,
nd those of Gen. K . from the east,
loved against the first forts under the
tost severe weather conditions. The
Lussians dragged their artillery to the
eights surrounding the fortresses and
hen all was ready began to bombard
orts Kara Gudelc. twenty miles, and
ort Dalan Gez. fifteen miles northeast
f Krzerum, preparatory to the bayoet
assault.
Passage Is Opened.
January -9 both forts capitulated. The
iking of Dalan Gez made a breach in
tie outer line defenses along the Beve
oinu range in front of the city. The
ipture of Kara Gudek opened a direct
assage through the Karabagas pass to
le city proper from the northeast
Kort Tafta lies midway between these
ao fortresses. In a night attack on
anuary 30 this fort was captured,
aving only C'haban Bebe between the
,vo armies operating from this quarir.
On February 2 the Russians began to
Lorm the whole front line on the Beve
oinn Heights. By evening all these
ositions were in Russian hands, perlitting
complete junction of the troops
n the northeast. The fall of this first
ne quickly decided the fate of the
iner forts. (
Men Get No Time to Rest. j
Meanwhile the I'alau Teken group of
orts, seven miles to the south, had
een surrounded on three sides. The
eneral assault on the second line be;an
without giving the men time for a
est. The five inner forts made only a
eeble resistance. Their garrisons beat
hasty retreat into the city, and fol)wed
the bulk of the troops which
1 ready were on the roads leading
westward. Only the rear guard took
art iri me nRiuing or tne last day.
igns that the evacuation was under
ray were observed immediately after
he fall of the first fort.
t is thought possible the Turks will

avorable point, which is in the hills
n the western edge of Erzerum valpy,
eleven miles distant, but it is not
egarded probable that they have been

FOR UNARMED SHIPS
Believed Germany Will Demand
That Merchantmen
Shall Not Attack U-Boats.
Baron Erich Zweldenik, charge of
the Austrian embnuy here, confered
today with Secretary Landing.
It wan understood Mr. I.ansinjg explained
to the charge why the
I'nited States did not acquiesce in
the announced intention of Germany
and Austria to sink armed
merchantmen after February 119, in
order that Baron Ztveidenik might
inform his government of the formal
communication on the subject the
I nited States soon is expected to
send to Berlin and Vienna.
Indications in official quarter?
today were that Germany's reply
to the reque t of the L'nited
States that the Teutonic powers
modify their announced intention
to sink without warning all armed
merchant ships of the enemy after
February- 29 will be a statement
tbat assurances given in the Lusilania
and Arabic cases had to do
milv with unarmed vessels: that
Germany must feel certain that
its submarines wlucli warn ,mer:liant
ships will not be attacked,
ind that this country shall give
its definition of defensive armament,
as distinct from offensive
irinament.
It was considered certain that
ihe problem of limiting armament
to defensive value will be
the basis of long negotiations.
German Statement.
It is stated itt German cireles that
evidence in their possession leads to
he conclusion that all British merchant
sliips. with the possible excepion
of those in transatlantic trade,
lad instructions to resist capture, and
hat the latter probably will be armed,
t was pointed out that the Clan Macavish,
sunk by the raider Aloe we, the
captor of the liner Apparn, had fought
vitli her guns until she went down.
It also was, declared that aboard the
ippam was round a document containng
additions to the original ronflden;ial
instructions "to all British-Born
>ea captains" and setting forth that:
"Any submarine whihc approaches a
nerchant vessel may be treated as hosile.
If chased, the merchant ship
hould first attempt to escape, and if it
annot it must head straight for the
uibmarine in order to prevent the
ffective use of the submarine's guns."

SUGGESTS TREATY !
MAYNOTBEVALID!
Representative Moore Chal- I
lenges Senate's Right to
Pass on Colombian Pact.
BASES HIS ARGUMENT
ON REVENUE FEATURE <
i
I
Holds, as It Remits Certain Import |
Duties. It Should Come Before
the House of Representatives.
The point that the Colombian
i a. a... u_; ;J I
llCdl\. I1UVV IJtMIlg UMIMUCICU 111,
the Senate at the suggestion of |
the President..is a violation of the j
constitutional prerogatives of the |
House which is given the exclu-|
sive power over revenue-raising I
matters, was made today in the '
House by Representative J.
Hampton Moore of Pennsylvania.
Mr. Moore said that inasmuch as
the treaty proposed to"remit certain
import duties, the purse
strings of the people of the United
States are directly affected by the
provisions of the proposed treaty.
"If distinguihed senators and representatives,"
said Representative
Moore, "who have discussed this matter
on previous occasions, are right as
to the contention that it matters
? iicinci vr nut ine icvcnucs uic ticated
or remitted by treaty, then it
would seem that the House of Representatives
must be consulted before
any such treaty as is proposed with
Colombia can be held valid."
Or, in other words, since the House
has the purse strings of the people to
watch through direction of the Constitution.
any treaty that knocks out import
duties to the extent that the Colombian
treaty proposes is a revenue
- measure to be first considered by the
House. That was the idea propounded
by Representative Moore and backed
up with many extracts from history
and constitutional law and legislative
precedence.
At the time he made his speech Representative
Moore also introduced a
resolution directing the ways and
means committee to inquire whether
the treaty does not violate the House
prerogatives. It states that the treaty
as originally presented to the Senate
provides for the payment of 125,000,000
and releases Colombia from paying certain
import duties.
Argument of Mr. Moore.
In part, he said:
"The President has forwarded to the
Senate and the Senate has under consideration
a treaty with Colombia
which proposes, by the payment of J25,\
000,000 of United Statees money, and ;
the remission of certain import du|
ties and charges that would ordinarily, !
and by law. accrue to the Treasury of
the United States, to make reparation
for certain alleged violations by the
l'nitarl C?ntoo rxf nortoin ollotrorl in- i
juries which Colombia is supposed to ,
have sustained through the loss of <
certain alleged rights in the Isthmus of <
Panama. This treaty, so directly affect- ,
ing the morals and the revenue of the ,
United States, is being considered, as f
we are informed, as if the power to ;
make such a treaty, so involving the ;
money of the people, rested exclusively .
with the President and the Senate, irrespective
of the authority and power j
specially delegated by the Constitution
to the House of Representattoes to

with respect to this appasent invasion
of the prerogative of the House that I
propose to put the House upon notice."
Mr. Moore took up the precedents, beginning
with the framing of the Constitution.
before the government was
fairly under way. He quoted Washington.
Rufus Choate and others and
also referred to House action at the
time of the freeing of Cuba, when "a
question having arisen as to the validity
of certain tariff duties on Philippine
imports, the House adopted a resoj
iution. brought in from the committee
on rules, legalizing and ratifying the
. collection or certain duties in dispute,
' it being stated by Mr. Dalzell that the

tion as to tne operation or prior treaty "

prerogatives as related to reve[
nue matters in treaties with foreign *
nations were given. * r
Revenues Directly Affected.
s
In conclusion, he said: f
"Unless we disassociate the Panama s
. Canal Zone from the United States, it ^
is evident, that the revenues of the t
1 United States?that is to say, *the
; purse strings of the people*?are direct- ^
ly affected by the provisions of the i
proposed treaty as they have been I
quoted, and if distinguished senators n
and representatives who have discussed t
this matter on previous occasions are ?
right as to the contention that it mat- b
ters not whether the revenues are ere- v
ated or remitted by treaty, then it
would seem that the House of Repre- i
sentatives must be consulted before s
J any such treaty as is proposed with 1
l Colombia can be held valid. s
"As to existing: revenue relations between
the United States and Colombia,
the records of imports and exports for
1914 (end of fiscal year, .June 30)
should be brought forward. According
to the statistical abstract (1914) the
exports from the United States to Colombia
amounted to $6,786,153. That
sum represented the purchases of Co|
lombia from the United States.
"It is more important, for a better
understanding of the subject in hand,
however, that we consider the imports
from Colombia, since they represent
purchases from that country by the
| United States. Our total imports in
1914 were valued at $16,051,120. of t
which $14,641,503 worth of goods were n
admitted to the United States free of
duty. There were dutiable imports
from Colombia, however, to the amount ^
of $1,409,617. a
"It thus appears that the House of j,
Representatives. the more popular e
branch of the legislature, to which the h
Constitution has delegated the power D
of originating revenue legislation, has d
not been consulted with respect to a j.
treaty which, evidently, cannot be t
validated without its approval."

NEW YORK. February 19.??
New York and the nation are now
one, it) the view of republican
politicians nere. >ince Mr.
Root's speech the aftermath
talk is all to that effect. They
argue that the Kmpire state's
place in the campaign henceforth
will he recognized as in the forefront.
There is a good deal of self-complacency
and some satisfaction in this
reflection. There is also self-complacency
when they roll off the names
r>f Hoot, Roosevelt and Hughes. Not
that the old guard and the new guard
:>f old line republicans are thinking
nuch of Col. Roosevelt as a candidate,
but they do not object to him as a
New Yorker who is exercising a strong"
nfluence on public sentiment. They
say that the appearance of Mr. Root
?nds the danger of Roosevelt disruptng
the republican organization in the
struggle for district delegates.
As to Justice Hughes, some of the
politicians who a few weeks ago were .
talking quite vociferously of him as ^
the man to save the party are now
talking with equal vociferation of Mr.
Root, but they still point to Justice
Hughes as an eminent New Yorker,
one whose influence helps to Keep the
Empire state to the forefront. So you
:an take your choice of the three eminent
New Yorkers and indicate a preference
without hurting anybody's feelings,
provided that you dwell on your
particular favorite's influence in the
?oming 'campaign "for whoever may
Pe nominated."
There is no question that during the
last few days the republicans have
vitalized, as they believe, national isjues,
and also have offered the rest
of the country the opportunity to And
l suitable candidate in New York.
Interested in Party Success.
What Mr. Root's mind is nobody pr*?
tends to know. It is known, however,
that he feels a profound concern In the
success of the republican party next
November and that his address disclosed
an intensity of feeling against
the Wilson administration's foreign
policy that surprised some of his own
friends. But that any of the so-called
managing politicians in New York will
be able to use his name to help their
own purposes no one believes. Mr. Root
knows the ways of politicians.
Still the question which constantly
recurs is whether Mr. Root is a receptive
candidate. The answer I have

of the country at large and not simply
on the response here in his home state.
Some of those who in the past have regretted
that the prejudice alleged to
exist against him would prevent his
getting a large vote in certain states
have changed their mind and insist
that there is no longer any prejudice
against Root.
It is certain, in their view, that republicans
all over the country will
iow begin to think of him as a candliate.
and that local sentiment can be
felt out, but no one with whom I have
:alked here believes that there will
3e any concerted effort to elect Root
lelegates, although William Barnes is
eported to be planning a western trip
vithout Mr. Root's sanction, with the
ntention of giving definite direction
:o the Root movement. Mr. Root in
:he past has not depended on Mr.
Barnes to represent him. and there are
t good many Missourians who will
vant to be shown his altitude has

iciary of bewildered republican delefates
to Chicago, but that Justice
Juglies is still a possibility. This
neans that though a number of poliicians
set out to develop Hughes
sentiment, the movement has got away
rom them, and has enough popular
iupport to result in the election of
lelegates who favor Hughes, no mater
what efforts the justice himself
nay make to prevent their election. So
ar as I have been able to learn, thero

o find the strongest condidate for
November, and both have In mind the

Gov. Whitman himself does not seem
o have developed as a leader of comlanding
importance, but he has shown
ome very good fighting qualities when
lis administration of state affairs is
ttacked. His movement was to be
ooked after by Mr. Aldridge and othrs
of the Rochester group who have
ad as much experience in practical
olitics as Mr. Barnes has had. They
id not have their way at the Carnegie

bowled out.
The point made by his enemies is
hat Gov. Whitman, while indorsed as
