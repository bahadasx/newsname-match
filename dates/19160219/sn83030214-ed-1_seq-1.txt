What Can Wilson Now Bid
to Gain Lusitania Victory?
"Armed Merchantmen" Note, ,Now Repudiated, First
Price for Concessions That Would Furnish
Political Capital for Administration.
By FRANK H. SIMONDS.
n- Wm*e? ?<? v? Mam :
Washington, Fab. 18. Whs th.* "armed merchantmen" note of the
Wilson Administration, no~ repudiated, Its last bid i<>r the longgotichf
"diplomatie rictor* " In Um Lusitania discussion? This is the question
that most Interests Washington to-nigfat, and in it i.*? found the sole ex
;'!aiiHti?in for the latent and most completo double somersault of the State
Department.
Th.? United States bad steadfastly adhered te the familiar practice
In the matter of armed merchantmen both before and since the war began,
'.he practicf recognized by international law and precedent. Suddenly it
changad about and serrad notice upon bell i go rents not merely that it
would be a good thing it' existing laws ami pra?*tices could be modified bj
c?ommon consent of all contestants, but that the ?United States was ga>
riously considering Riodifjring them itself. It not merely suggested in
ti any paragraphs, it threatened in one.
What aras ths result? On January 29 the "humanity note'' about
armed merchantmen was made public. Six day* later Germany delivered
the Lusitania note, the last, tinal, ultimate expression of German gen
erosity in the matter of murdered Americans. It was "almost" satis?
factory. Four ?lays later Mr. Lansing and Mr. Bi'rnstorff agreed on an
amendment. There wa? to be more than an "inferential disavowal." Ger?
many was going to lecognin responsibility. This magnanimity was a
natural (?ot.?e.i*i?'ti',e O? the "humanity note."
SHOCK TO ADMINISTRATION.
Xext day, l.'iwever, Berlin announced that following the principle
laid down by the American "humanity note" Germany wouM begin on
.March 1 to sink ail armed merchantmen on sight. This was a shock to
the Wilson Administration. Evidently Germany meant to vre? her pay in
advance. She had not yet consented to "recognise/* but she was hasten
| to put the American note to good Teutonic uses.
Live day*" later Germany was ready t - pay. Her acceptance of the?
I anging Berastorff .amendment was indicated In h communication that
arrived on February 15, and forthwith all Washington dispatches broke
