Ono day sh<r realized that she
wouldn't be young so very much
longer. She wanted to have a rose
garden, and kiddies, and a husband.
Hut the opportunity never came—
until Mr. Guenthers, the gray-haired
corporation lawyer, and his meek lit
tle wife, came to her with a bargain.
She was to have her rose garden—
and a maimed, invalid son of a rich
woman for a husband. The lawyer
had looked her over. He considered
that she would make a satisfactory
wife. She was weary, and longed for
the luxuries of life. And so, one day,
kneeling beside her half-conscious
bridegroom, she guided his hand as it
slipped the wedding ring over her
finger.
Then the terror of what she had
done, and the swift impulse to go
back \d her library! She knelt at
the threshold of a new life, already
bitter-sweet with its weird mixture
of misery and luxury. . . .
