Behind the Proposed Recall, Ac
cording to Current Rumor Peti
tions Said to Be Out Next Week.
Recall of Mayor Mason and four
members of the council la the general
topic of discussion on the streets to
day, and it Is currently reported that
recall petitions will be circulated
early next week. Certain members
of the fire department are credited
with the movement.
The Introduction of the ordinance
for the remodelling of the Are de
partment and the laying down of a
most stringent set of rules tor the
conduct of the members la one of the
matters on which the administration
is censured.
j Others also take exception to the
prohibition ordinance, as passed on
Tuesday night. This, they contend,
.places a burden upon the city which
'the county Is supposed to assume.
i Although the proposed recall Is be-

still in a somewhat nebulous state.
Those behind the movement say they
have been assured of much support.
