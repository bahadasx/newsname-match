DANIELS ASKS EOR
BIG APPROPRIATION
Immediate Necessary Repairs to
United States Naval Equip
ment Needed
The McNamara mine will resume
operations next week. That is Just
about the biggest and best news that
has hit the camp since the arrival ot
the Schwab interests and the enlarge
ment of the Extension mill.
At one time the McNamara was
paying a one cent dividend every
month, but it has a small territory
and the known ore bodies were quick
ly exhausted. Now cornea news that
ore exists in a portion of the property
hltheto unexplored and It la good
ore at that, with assurances that there
is a considerable amount.
The McNamara has made arrange
ments to work through the West End
shaft and levels. In carrying on Its
sloping operations in the West End
claim, one of the slopes hag pursued
the ore to the McNamara line.
To reach this point from the Mc
Namara shaft would necessitate cut
ting a new station and driving several
hundred feet of crosscut or the alter
native of sinking a winze from the
375-foot level. Either of these me-
thods would necessitate tbe expendi
ture of several thousand dollars for!
dead work, and the waste of a good
deal of time. For this reason the ar
rangement with the West End com-1
pany was deemed very-satisfactory
and will allow the McNamara com
pany to take out whatever ore is ex
posed at the present time, as well as
project this territory for extensions
of this ore at very reasonable cost.
- The ore which Is exposed on the
line and the ore which the West End
took out of its adjacent stope Is of
very good grade, but as the territory
has not, been explored until very re
cently, its extent is unknown. Its gen
eral appearance, however, la very en
couraging and a good net profit will
undoubtedly be made from the start.
J. W. Bherwin will have charge of
the work, looking after the Interests
of both the McNamara and the West
End companies. He hopes to be able
to begin work during the coming
week, as only a few details of tbe
arrangement of the work between the
two companies remain to be adjusted.

WILL INVESTIGATE THE
The Tonopah Moose have been so
welled up and are lording It so over
the Elks since they took the starch
out of them at indoor baseball the
other night In the Airdome, that the
Eaglet could stand it no longer. They
claim that baseball is the national
game and they are the national bird,
hence their defi, challenge, chip on the
shoulder, or whatever it might be
termed.
They met last evening in the upper
branches of a dead pine and expres
ed their oDinion of the Moose, who
can neither fly into trees nor rllmb
them, and when anybody knocks the
ball up into the rafters, they have to
retrieve it with a stepladder, giving
little Brownie the credit for three
runs which he did not earn.
Thence and therefore three of the
homeliest, but most pugnacious birds
tn the bunch, N. M. McCormlck, ('has
Richards and Bill Evans were depu
tized to prepare an ultimatum and pre
sent It to the self-axalted Moose, re
quiring that they either meet them
on the Indoor diamond or get pecked
worse than Tom Rlsch s bulldog was
by the Are department eagle several
years ago.
It Is extremely probable that the
defl will be accepted ;.nd that the
game will be played :.nd that it will
carry with It an Intensity of Interest
that could be excelled by nothing else
than the half-considered contest or
the bankers' and schoolmarms' bas
ketball teams.

PARIS, Feb. 19. Many seldierar-

and sculpture, Is being cultivated. M.
Gheusl, director of the Opera Coml-

number of scoreB which reach him
from all quarters, even from the
trenches. But there is this difference
that whereas the civilian revels In
material themes the soldier-musician
sounds the pastoral note and seeks In
spiration from nature In her country
aspects. Some of the- latter contribu
tions are of no mean order and there
Is notably one score an opera In
three acts which bears the hallmarks
of a masterpiece. The production of.
this work will prove anything but
costly as there are only two scenes,
the sea and a mountain pinnacle, and
three characters.

CHIEF OF POLICE WILL COLLECT

In obedience to the mandates of or
dinance No. 17, which provides that
all dogs in Tonopah Bhall be tagged
and that the tags will cost either 12.50
or 5.00, according to the sex of the
dog, Chief of Police Evans began Its
enforcement.
Some dog owners paid, others refus
ed, declaring that the -ordinance was
illegally enacted and was therefore
void. It was alleged that It had been
passed, as was the Corona avenue
closing ordinance, when the board
of county commissioners had not fix
ed a certain day upon which to trans
act the business of the Town of To

The matter was taken 10 tne legal
adviser of the board, the district at

former last evening rendered an opin
ion that the ordinance was illegal.
This left the chief in a quandary,
but he tells the Bonanza that be has
decided to hold all the money collec
ted for licenses and return it those
who made the payments, awaiting only
the action ot the board at the next
meeting. Meanwhile the muzzling or
dinance will be strictly enforced.

WASHINGTON, Feb. 19. An army
investigation of Robinsons charges
that Colonel Reber, chief of the avia
tion service, has conducted the aero
corps in an inefficient manner, has
.been ordered. A board is toj conduct
the inquiry.
Never before in the history of athle
tics in Tonopah has a more popular
result been attained, than the winning
of the high school tournament by the
team from Virgin high school at
Bunkerville. In all their games the
Bunkervllle boys showed an absolute
regard for all the rules of true sportl
They played hard, silently and clean,
but effectively. They s showed, too,
the advantage of strict sacrificial
training, and their subjection of the
individual to the organization was a
sermon in Itself on the great text,
"team work."
The schedule, made up by lot, seem
ed to resolve itself into an elimina
tion contest, leaving the final game
to determine the series. Las Vegas
and Bunkerville attained the first
division during the first two days of
play, and Manhattan and Tonopah
won the rlgh to fight for the tall-end
position, accordingly the minor game
was made a preliminary to that which
was to determine the district cham
pionship. Tonopah and Manhattan clashed
from the first whistle, and for the
whole time of play the game really
belonged to either team, altho' the
firBt half gave Tonopah an eight point
lead. The game was slow throughout,
the teams being tired from the long
selge of playing. The second half
saw a great revival on the part of
Manhattan, and It looked for a time
as though the local -ooys would be
nosed out. The final score, 33 to 36,
however, was In Tonopah's favor.
Individual stars would be hard to
pick. James O'Connell played his
usual brilliant game. Tiltitim Pollard
