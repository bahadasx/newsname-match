MEXICANS GET HOMES.

The history or the world
history of suffering for the
Rule
t .e
is a
ma
ny. And only by wading thru seas
of blood have the tolling masses
eer gained any measure of lib
erty. Uprisings are recorded from
the earliest dates "f which we
have nny second, and how little
advance the working class has
made may he Judged by their
present condition,
That is chiefly due to the fact
that the workers have always
been betrayed Just as they pro
in elections today. They fought
(gainst their oppression In power.
only to put In their own leaders
who later became their oppress
ors. '
The Mexican revolution appears
to have Ihvi the only Intelligent
one in history And how thus'
people have suffered for hundred
of years I But the Mexican! hav
gained a clear victory over ty-1
ranny, nnd unless they who rob
ImmI the Mexicans and their lying I
newspapers can ro.i tins or some
other nation to butt in. the Mex
icans will be the fits; to lx really
free and happy.
l.'p to 1521 the Mexicans were
free. Like the American Indians.
they were c hilldren of the fore;
a net were a orave, nospnaoie peo-
pie. Of course they had never
heard of -Christian civilisation'1
and didn't know what it meant to ,
be rttM from above!
But along came General forte?,
with the usual missionary outfit
of bullets, bibles, booze and glass
leads. The simple minded In
dians treated the new-comers
kindly.
History written by the white
man. tells but one story of the re
ception given the white intruders
by the Indians in Cuba, in North
ami South America, and in .Mexico
Everywhere the Indians were
friendly and Shared what they
had with the whites. Nat until
they discovered that the - good I
Christians'' were here only for
murder nnd plunder did the In-1
iliaius show fight and then they
had only bowsand arrows to go
up against powder ami lead
At 'he time of the landing of
the Spaniards in Mexico Mmtezu
ma was the great Indian chief.
Cortes arranged a friendly visit
to the chief, and while the chief
was entertaining the new comers
in the most hospitable way he
could. they seised him and his aids
and put them in irons.
It Wits by such methods that
the Christians got the upper hand
of the heathen nnd enslaved him
Then came the Jesuits, priests and
nuni to '-educate-' him. The "edu
catlon' consisted chief ly of teach
ing them how to produce wealth
for their masters
All of the lOOt that was not re- i
tuined by the priesthood and the
civil rulers apiointcd by Spain
was shipped to the mother coun
try. And Spain demanded full
measure,
By the year 1800 "the ch irch '
had grown so rich and powerful
that it decided to throw off ti
yoke of spain. The clergy got
tired of dividing up and fomented
a revolution against Spanish au
thority that was successful
Thus the Mexicans gained their
Independence of Spain but not of
' the church.-' The constitution of
the year 1812 contained this
t la use :
"The religion of the Mexican
nation is, and will jierpetually be.
the ltoman Catholic Ajvostolic.
The nation will protect it by wise
and just laws, and PUOHIDIT the
exercise of any other whatever.'
The .clericals who today nre
yelping for "religious liberty' in
Sfoxlco should read the above to
their congregations There now
IS religious liberty in Mexi'-o to
day for the first time in its his
tory, but that isn't what the
clericals want. They want a
monopoly, And don't forget that
whatever was done in Mexico was
done by Catholics. It was the re
sult of 400 years of exclusive
clerical education
At the,, time of the revolution
against Spam in 1810 the popula
tion of Meneo was 5,300,000. Of
these but 00,000 were Spaniards -mostly
priests and office-holders.
You may Judge the degree of
morality among Jie Spaniards by
there being 1,400,000 mixed
bloods. Before the arrival of the
Spaniards there were only pure
blood Indians.
il was about to forget a very
Jhportant part of the education
al system establishes by "the
church'' in Mexico. It was the
Inquisition established in the Kith
century. They held special holi
days called ' Autodu fe,'' mean
ing; an "act of faith.'' on which
days the non-believers would be
publicly toitured and burned at
the stake That is the way th"
priests make converts where they
have the power The Inquisition
building still stands in Mexico
City and is now used its chO Acud
emy of Medicine
After- 4 ) years of "Inde end-ence-'
the Mexican people discov
ered that they were even worse
enslaved than under Spain 'The
church'' had crown wealthy and
powerful while the people wen
slaves, and In iwr; a revolution
broke out against the power ol

to do what Wilson set out to do
when he ordered our Navy to
Vera Crut intervene, Rut the
Mexicans drove the French out
and proclaimed a new constitu
tion in which is found :
There shall bs perfect inde
pendence between the affairs a
the state and the .affairs purely
ecclesiastical, Th e government
w in limit Itself to protecting with
its authority the public worship
of the Catholic religion AND AM

That paragraph clipped the
claws (St "tlte church '' It separ

the title is in the bishop. Of the
billions of dollars worth of pro
perty the Catholics of the United
States are supposed to own. the
lay members have no more title
to it, and no more to say about
its management, than the pro
