Bootlegger Slips
One Over on Cops
A wily bootlegger at Mannlngton foil
ed the officers this morning by pasting
a label on his suitcase while they were
not looking. The bootlegger arrived la
Mannlngton on train No. 2 from Wheel
ing and went from the railroad sta
tion down to the glass factory which is
near the Fairmont car line.
The bootlegger was waiting there tor
daylight and the tnterurban car, when
Constable Connors and Chief Watts ar
rived and arrested him.
Twenty-three pints^of wliiskey and
one quart of wine were carried by the
man in an unlabeled suitcase, when
the officers escorted him back to Mann
/ington. But when the man and the
evidence wore brought before Justice
Barracks for a hearing this morning,
the suitcase was found to be properly
labeled and the Innocent bootlegger
'had to be dismissed., How .the label

Agricultural Agent Smith
Has Seen the Blighted
Buds.
januafiy heat dio ir
Does Not Amount to Much
From An Economic
Standpoint.
County Agricultural Agent H. L.
Smith returned from Metz and neigh
borhood yesterday afternoon where he
had been doing some demonstration
pruning. On this trip he discovered
that most of the Marlon county peach
crop is ruined.
The extreme warm weather in Jan
uary and the subsequent zero days
have caused the peach buds in most
all the Marlon county orchards to be
come frozen and the crop destroyed.
There were days In January -when
the buds became so tender that most
of the farmers In this section predict
ed that should very cold weather fol
low the warm spell their peaches
would be killed.
Marlon county orchards are not any
of them very large, there being but ;0n
one or two orchards which pass the
300-tree mark, but most of what the
people have in this county are ruined
for the season.
The kaleldiacoplc weather which
has visited Fairmont, in the past few
weeks, if kept up much longer will
ruin more-crops in this\ section .Is the
opinion many farmers, who have
been-to see Mr. Smith.,lately.
Told About GcooilWork
of Fafm^olng/People
Quite a successful meeting. of' the
agriculturists of Marlon county was
held in the Whetstone school near
Mannington last evening. The meet
ing was held in conjunction with the
Whetstone Literary society and was
quite largely attended and lectures
of various instructive natures.
County Agricultural Agent H. L.
Smith and Secretary A. L. Thomas
were in charge of the meeting and
both made addresses.
Miss Cora Price told the visitors
of the meeting of the good work which
her girl's canning club is doing and
has done in the past year. A. L.
Thomas elaborated on the splendid
work of the boy's corn clubs.
H. L. Smith with his stereopetlcan
views of the various farms and dalrys
in Marlon county lectured on the beBt
methods of running a farm for profit
and In many ways helped to make
the meeting a success.
Mannington Dems
Nominate a Ticket

call their ticket ttao Citizens' Party
ticket, held a convention last night

of the faithful present, and others
claiming as many as 18 or 20. How
ever, there were enough, present to
handle the situation with character
istic diplomacy and a ticket that will
answer all practical purposes was se
lected with ease and dispatch.
L. S. Schwank is the chairman of
the Mannington party and C. C. Conk
lln Is the secretary, but for some un
explained reason neither of these dis
tinguished part; leaders were not
present at the convention.
