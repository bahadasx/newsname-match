Finger Print Chief of the De

Suspect in Jacksonville.
A dispatch from Jacksonville, Fla.,
gives tho nows that Inspector Joseph
A. Faurot, Chief of tho Detective
Bureau of New York Police Depart
ment, and Detective Hergeant Will
iam Ualey, the Inpector right hand
man In tho finger print division, were
arrested yesterday as confidence men
and taken to Jacksonville Police
Headquarters. Thcro tho Inspector
showed his credentials and two Jack
sonville sloutbs suddenly acquired a
reputation that will stick to thorn
nil their lives,
Inspector Faurot, on a leavo of
absence on account of slcknoss, and
Sorgt. Haley, on vacation, loft here
by boat for Jacksonville Inst Tues
day, arriving there yesterday morn
ing. The Immense tourist business in
Florida this season has lured an army
of sure-thing men and tho sleuths of
Jacksonville. Palm Beach, St.
Augustine and other centres of
tourist activity are keeping a keen
lookout for sharpers from tho No'th.
Two of Jacksonville's plain clothes
men met tho boat and spotted tho two
well drrssod, alert looking New York
ers right away. Faurot and Haley
were to lie In town only for tho ilny
on their way to J'alm Beaoh, so they
didn't register at a hotel, but Just
loafed around. In tha course of the
day they visited all tho largo hotels,
but met no one thoy knuw. Tho Idea
that they wore being "trailed" by two
provincial sleuths never occurred to
them until last night, when tho local
Ilawkshuws urrestcd them on the
street.
"You all Is pinched," said one of the
Jacksonville "bulls."
Faurot wanted to know why and
was told that he and Haley were In
tho Judgment of the Jacksonville Po
lice Department u mcuaco to tho
community. Then Faurot ventured to
reveal his identity.
"That's a new one," laughed tho
Jacksonville men. "Cliilmln' to bo
cops is a right original' Idea."
Fuumt and Haley said no more.
They were content. Tho sleuths took
them beforo Police Chief F. C. Ro.ioh,
where their credentials quickly estab
lished Innocence of wrongdoing.

CALLED FINAL CLUE
N GIRL'S POISONING
Prosecution to Contend Bottle
Held Potion That Killed
Marian Lambert.
HIDDEN UNDER SNOW.
Analysis Proves That Cyanide
of Potassium Caused
Death of Victim.
WAUKFXJAN, UL, Feb. Rt.-Anmall
gloss bottlo found In tho mud at the
Hacrcd Heart Crossing of tho Chicago
and Northwestern Railroad a few
hundred feet from tho throo big oaks
whero tho Lako Forest schoolgirl,
Marlon Lambert, died Is now in tho
possession of State's Attorney Dady.
It Is bellcvod this botlle held the
poison thnt killed the girl. Since It
was stated that Will Orpet purchased
a two ounco vial from C. F. Hassln
ger, a druggist of Madison, Wis., there
has been a wldo search for It.
The bottle was found by Hhorlff
Griffin of Luke County after the rain
bad meltod away a snowbank at the
Sncrod Heart Crossing. He admitted
to-day ho had found tho vial, but
Dady was non-committal. Tho Mad
ison druggist's clork, Hasstngcr, will
be asked If It is the satno ho, sold tq
Orpet Just hofore tho student left
Madison to moot the Lambert girl In
Lake Forest.
Wlillo counsel for tho defense of
Orpet contendod to-day that tho
latest bit of evldcnco In the death
tragedy of Marian Lambert will es
tablish that tho girl committed sui
cide, Prosocutor J. Dady contended
Just us earnestly it will prove sno
was murdered.
Tha discovery that It was cyantdo
of potassium, and that nlono, which
caused Marian's death was consid
ered by thoso who havo followed the
events of tho tragedy closely, as
merely weaving another mystery into
tho case.
Tho defense's claims woro based on
this premise. It has been sliown that
tiny urystals found beneath Marian
Iimbcrt's finger nails wero cyanide
of potassium. Tho poison In her
stomacb was the same. It Is there
fore shown, they contend, that the
girl, to get tho cynnldo beneath her
nails, must have taken tho poison In
a crystallno form herself, by taking
It between hor fingers from a box
or paper container.
Tho Mate's claims, on tho con
trary, wero based on this conclusion:
Orpet had access to cyanide kflpt by
his father for uso In gardening. A
hidden container of cyunldo was
found buried beneath ashes at the
Orpet greenhouse. The poison be
neath tho girl's ringer nails could
bo accounted for In several wuys.
She might havo thrust her lingers
'into her mouth in nn effort to ro
! Ileve herself of the poison.
Tho tangle of pr- Ibllltles In tho
enso mieinod no clearer to-day than
at any tlmo slnco young Orpt admit-
ted ho had been In tho woods with
tho girl when she died.
The Statu Intimated to-day many
points of tho mystery may bo clearod
at the inquest Monday,
At that tlmo tho report of Dr. Ralph
Webster, tho chemist who established
the naturo of tho poison that killed
I Italian, will bn rcurl In full. His test
upset tho Stnto's throry that a com
bination of poison.", siippoHiKlly cyan

Kaiser's Advisers Refuse lo
Prepare Another Note on
Sinking of Lusitania.
BERLIN (via Amstordnm), Feb. 19.
Germany lias said hor last word on
tho Lusitania matter and will not
prepare another noto dealing with
that question, it "was strongly indi
cated in ofllclil circles to-day,
O III rials are not commenting frcoly
upon the latest reports from Wash
ington that Sccrotary Lansing will
not recognlzo Germany's rights to
torpedo armed merchantmen. But tho
official attitude, as nearly aa can bo
stated, Is Uils:
Oermany docs not bcllevo tho
United States should interrogate hor
too olosoly upon tho munncr in which
tho now policy Is to bo enforced.
Should tho Foreign Olllco inform
Washington Just how German sub
murlno commanders will Interpret
tho term "armed merchantmen" In
executing these orders, olllclals bo
Ilcvo Germany would bo imparting
important naval secrets. Germany
believes that this Is a purely military
matter concerning only herself and
her allies.
BxaclJy what attltudo tho Foreign
Olllco will take, in vlow of tho latest
reports from Washington, Is not doll
nltcly known. It was stated to-day
that Ambassador von Hornatorff al
ready has been fully Instructed rela
tive to tho Lusitania statement.
These Instructions permit him to mako
tho changes miggcstod In his recent
conferences with Secretary Lansing.
Olllclals consider that tho Lusitania
case itself was really closed at theso
conferences.
AMSTERDAM, Feb. 19. Reports
that the United Slates will not sub
mit to Germany's now policy ot tor
pedoing all armed merchantmen, havo
aroused Indignation In Germany, ac
cording to udvlces received hero to
day. The Cologne, Gazette, which has
close relations - Ith tho German Gov
ernment, declares Germany will not
curtail tho rights ot her submarines
on account ot reckless noutruls who
Insist on travelling on belligerent
uhips.
Tho other newspapers express tho
greatest usUmlshmcnl at the, news
from Washington, but for tho most
part await confirmation from Am
bassador llernstnrff before expres
sing decided opinions.

ROW WITH FARRAR?
YOU'LL NEVER HEM . Jf .
CARUSO ADMIT IT VU
'What Happens Behind
Scenes," Says Tenor, "Is Not
for Public to Know."
Putrono of grand opera who saw
Geraldlno Karrar play Carmen In
Chicago last December can testify
that if Ulgnor Caruso protestod
against tho strenuous realism of her
Interpretation Thursday night he did
not know v.'hen he was well off. If
he had mado him play tho death
scene as she did It with Muratora In
tho Chicago Opera Company, Curuso
would still bo all out of breath.
As it was tho thcutro district was
still full ot gossip to-day regarding
Miss Fnrrar's athletic Interpretation
of tho rolo Thursday evening and tho
war ot words between herself and
Caruso that is said to have followed
behind tho scenes.
In her Mini version of Carmen, tho
prima donna Is yanked off tho gatu
of the bull ring by her hair, rushed
violently away, and then stabbed,
whereat she dies at considerable
length, facing tho uudienco on her
knees with her eyes rolling upward
In agony,
This proved so effective on tho
scroeu that Miss Farrar and Muratore
tried It In opera, ull but tho part
whero ho drugs her from the gate.
Tho Chicago audiences gusped, per
haps, but thoy liked It, and Miss Far
rar got curtain calls Innumerable.
With Caruso, however, tho strenu
ous climax had to be given up. It
may havo been all very well for a
slim tenor like Muratore, but the
Motroiolltan star cannot do any
rushing around or bending over with
out endangering thn llfo of tho next
top notu thut comes his way. There
fore, according to those who wit
nessed Thursday night's perform
ance, Miss Karrur had to expend her
surplus energy on a convenient
chorus girl und In one brief struggle
with Curtmo.
Final honors in this strugglo seam
to havo fallen to tho tenor, for the
prima donna's foot slipped and she
sat down somewhat abruptly. Inci
dents of that kind tend to try an
artist's tamper, and the "little bird"
that is always on duty behind the
scenes ut the opera house reports that
thi-ro wero winds betweon Caruso und
Miss Furrar after the oiirtaln fell.
When seen to-day Slgnor Curuso
would not deny thut ho and Miss
Furrur hud ltidulg"d In a few asperi
ties as to each nther'u performances,
but ho courteously declined to com
ment on them.
"What occurs behind tho scenes,
that Is our business," ho said. "Whut
occurs on thn stage that Is for tho
public. It Is not well to publish
things which hot one artist against
another We must be a luippy family
heie.

Stevena'abandoning other Important
work to take the third traeklng work.
President Theodore P. Shonts of the
Interborough wus smiling -when h
faced tho Thompson committee thnt
afternoon, but the smile soon faded,
"Did you use the words 'commit
ments und obligations' In your con.
versatlon asido with Gurdlner M,
rmu after thn break-up of tho Inter,
bor nigh directors' meeting?" asked
Counsel Hulnlirldgo Colby.
"To the best of my recollection I
used ono or both of them," Mr. Shonts
replied. "I think that I said that all
the commitments I have mnde have
been on thn bnsls that prices And

"You ucem to think In mottoes,'
commented Mr. Colby. "Do you evee
