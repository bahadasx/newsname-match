THIS talk about "making your own opportunity" is wrong.
Men don't make their own oyportunities. They merely get
ready; prepare homselves to grasp and use the opportunity for
their own personal profit and advantage. The man who has
sufficient ambition, industry and courage to prepare for the oppor
tunity will always find it awaiting him.
The realization of your ambition will be advanced by present
use of our bank account plan.

Cure Hog Cholera.
The word "cure" is seldom used in
connection with hog cholera. Why?
Because of the frequent failures. But
we use the word "cure" and guarantee
that B. A. Thomas Hog Powder will
cnre 90 hogs out of 100. The record to
day is a little over 95 out of 100, so we
guarantee 90.
We don't care what others may
think or say. We know what we are
doing and will sell you B. A. Thomas
Hog Powder, guaranteeing that it will
save 9 out of 10 hogs. It is medicine
straight medicine. It is because it's
straight medicine that it cures 95 times
in 100 G. W. Meyers, Hays.

We learned recently that a man
(whose name we did not hear) felt
agrieved because the tax assessor did
not assess his property high enough.
He visited several of the county officers
and wanted to know why his taxes were
much lower than his neighbors, but
none of these could help him. That
citizen should be decorated for being
an' honest man. He surely is the man
that Diogenes,, was looking for with
his lantern and it has taken nearly
twenty centuries to find him.
Wednesday evening, when the south
side hose cart arrived at the scene of
the Catholic College fire and after con
siderable delay in unwinding and con

that the nozzle had been left behind.
What Hays need3 the worst way and
should be looked after at once is an or
ganized fire company that would drill
at least once a month. Also adequate
fire equipment should be provided; some
day half of the business portion of the
city will go up in smoke because of this
dereliction. Don't wait till the horse
is stolen before the barn is-locked.

A very pleasant social affair was the
birthday surprise on Mrs. Pearl Gar
rett, on Thursday evening the 3rd at
her home on Chestnut Street. Her
daughters planned this evening for
their mother's pleasure and invited
about thirty ladies most of whom were
Methodist women friends. Mrs. Wood
played a piano number and Mrs. Hale
gave a humorous reading and several
"sell" games followed which made
much merriment. In behalf of the
ladies present, Mrs. W. A. Lewis pre
sented a handsomely engraved silver
spoon to Mrs. Garrett as a reminder of
the occasion. An appetizing lap lunch
eon closed the evening.
A New School Building for Hays
The problem of adequate school facil
ities for Hays, confronts us and must
be met. To meet the growing demands
of the public schools, the old building
has been remodeled, repaired and parti
tioned off to make extra rooms until
the limit has been reached. Should the
enrollment next September show the
same rate of increase it has for the
past two years, there will be fifty or
more children unprovided for. The
grades are overcrowded. Some High
school classes are required to recite in
the Study hall and in the diminutive of
fice provided for the superintendent.
A well equipped, efficient system of
fmblic schools is a town's best asset,
t attracts people of the best class, and
makes those who are here want to stay.
If Hays is to keep pace with its neigh
boring towns, it must ofier equal or
superior educational advantages. The
drawing power of the Normal school
must be supplemented by equally at
tractive educational facilities for - the
High School and grade children. This
is purely a matter of buisness and of
public welfare and should be considered
from that view point alone.
Plainville, Luray, Lucas and Wilson
have good new buildings. Elli3 recent
ly voted bonds for a new building.
Hays certainly is able to afford as good
facilities as these-towns.
The most feasible plan seems to be
to erect a substantial High school build
ing that will sarve our needs for years
to come, by issuing long term bonds
that will distribute the cast over gen
erations who get the use of the building.
Use the present building for the
grades as long a3 it is adequate, then
erect ward buildings as needed.
The Board respectfully submits this
question for the serious consideration
of the patrons and tax payers whom we
serve.
Very respectfully,
The Board of Education,

OBITUARY
Isaiah Jewell was born in East Farn
ham in Province of Quebec, Canada,
August 25, 1S33. He served our coun
try during the Civil War, enlisting Jan
uary 22, 1S62 and receiving honorable j
aischarge February 20, 1S65. On Octo- j
ber 5, 1S64 he was united in marriage :
with Elizabeth M. Carver, and to this j
marriage two children were born, E. !
A. Jewell who with his family lives in ;
Hays, and Ida Jewell who died in child- j
hood. March 6, 1S75 he married Lydia I
Linness Book who survives him. To ;
this union ten children were born, some ;
of whom have gone on before. Those
who remain to share with the mother '
the sorrow are: May Williams; Ethel :
McGuire of Tonopah, Nevada; Nina .
Wood; Frank Jewell; Lester Jewell and j
Jessie Arveson of Chapman, Kansas, j
and Mrs. Frank Payne, Mrs. Jewell's j
daughter by a former marriage. There i
are also twenty-one grandchildren, two f
great grandchildren, and numerous
nieces and nephews living in the neigh
borhood. All his children speak of his
kindness and loving care toward them
and their mother.
Mr. Jewell came to Hays December
7, 1S73, and has resided in this county
ever since thirty-seven years last
December. He united with the Baptist
church in February 1904. He went to
his rest February 14, 1916. Thus closes
a long life. During this last illness
much suffering was experienced result
ing from a fall received two weeks ago
last Thursday. He frequently spoke of
being ready to go and be at rest.
A Late Easter.
Ash Wednesday, the first day of
Lent, falls this year on March 8th.
Easter Sunday falls on April 23d, the
latest date in many, many, decades.
Easter will not fall so late again until
1943, when the date will be April 25th.
Easter will not fall on April 23d again
until the year 2,000 and there will not
be very many of us still living to help
celebrate the event. Examples of lata
Easters are comparatively few. In
1728, the records show that Easter fell
on April 28th and in 1739 on April 23 th.

Lincoln's Birthday.
On last Sunday evening a full house
greeted Dr. W. A. Lewis. While he
was not feeling at his best because of
a severe cold, he was able to deliver an
address on Lincoln that held the most
rapt attention for one hour. His speech
was not along the usual paths of
Eulogies but approached the "Great
Emancipator" from a different angle.
Many were the kind words of appreci
ation spoken. He built his address
about the three epochs Jesus Christ,
who set the souls free to worship God;
Martin Luther, who made it possible to
worship God with a conscience free;
and Abraham Lincoln, who made every
man a vaster, no man a slave.
The music was well rendered. Mr.
Wallace is proving himself a real chorus
leader. The anthem was highly appre
ciated. The quartet under the direction
of Prof. Malloy was enjoj-ed by the au
dience. For a long time the audiences
at the Methodist church have ben
growing, and now the people are com
mencing to talk of enlarging their fine
auditorium vthat already holds 600 peo
ple. It is only a short time until they
will have to have an auditorium to seat
1000. During the stay of Rev. Hale,
the audiences have doubled and the
Sunday School had increased at least
150 per cent. -
