nfter being cordially greeted by Mr. Smith,

questions it was suggested by Director Twin
ing that he co to the Department of City
Trarslt in the Bourse and look over the
plans for the high speed lines. Tho New

TROOPS' HOMECOMING
RECEPTI0N,T0 BE FIXED
BY GEN. LEONARD WOOD
Men Will Be -Under Federal
Control and Commander
Has Charge of Arrangements
WILL 'SPEED UP' GREETING
Arrangements to give a rousing home-
coming reception to Philadelphia troops
when they return .from the border will be
completed through Major General Leonard
Wood, commander of tho Department of the
East. This was decided today by Mayor
Smith and the Special Joint Councllmanlo
Committee on Military Affairs when word
came from El Paso. Tex., that the First
and Third Regiments would come directly
to Philadelphia, Instead of going to Mount
Oretna. They will be mustered out of the
service at their armories In this city.
Tho troops will be under Federal control
when they arrive In Philadelphia, and this
will make It necessary to make al arrange
ments for a h peace jubilee through General
Wood. The dates for the reception will be
fixed by Adjutant General Thomas J.
Stewart, of the National Guard.
The Joint councllmanlo committee has
decided to "speed up" Its plans for the re
ception because of the decision to disband
the troops in Philadelphia Instead of at
Mount Oretna, It bj'now expected that the
troops will arrive In Philadelphia by the
middle of next week, whereas Jf they had
been ordered to Mount Oretna they would
have been fully a week longer reaching
home.
The First Regiment Is scheduled to leave
El Paso today, and the Third Regiment will
entrain at 2 o'clock tomorrow afternoon.
At the meeting of the committee yesterday
the consensus of opinion was that the home
coming reception should be a duplicate of
the big peace Jubilee given In honor of the
troops that returned home from the
panlsh-American War In 1S.
Mayor Smith talked over the long
distance telephone to Colonel Bartlett,
Major General Wood's chief of staff, and
urged the co-operation of the Department
of the East in making the arrangements
and in giving information relating to the
departure of the troops from the border
a,nd to their arrival In Philadelphia. Such
data. Mayor Smith explained, aro needed at
the earliest opportunity, so that all the
plans for the reception might be worked
out with precision.
