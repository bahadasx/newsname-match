paper man. "The World is now the
second newspaper In Oklahoma to

about the undertaking. Not u few-1

Couldn't Find Woolley.
Just how It happened that Townsend
was given a county commission could
not be learned last night as Sheriff
Woolley could not lie found Townsend
Is the only otflcer who holds both a
county and city commission, It Is un
derstood. In speaking of their resignation
last night Wolfe declared: "Mr. Hew
by and myself feel that we have not
heen dealt witli fairly. We have been
elilligeut In the pursuit of all kinds of
law breaking and have followed In
structions iinplii-itoly.
"We have heard from a number or I
sources that Mr. Townsend has critl-j
cised us and we belii've unjustly. He
declared we are' told that there was'
too much liquor being sold In he
e'onnty. This coming from him is;
really amusing as in Tulsa alone yes-1
tcrday forty di units were taken to the'
police station. From I bis we Judge j
that whl.sky Is i.eing sold somcw not e
else.
"So when we learned that Mr.
Townsend had been apopinted we de
sliled to step doii and out and let
him e-h'un up the county alone."
Mr. Hi'vvlev was ciiuully as lesentful
at the sheriff's action.
