DISTRICT PROSPERS
Federal' Report Shows That Farmers
Are Liable to Spend Large Sums,
....-^Thereby Aiding Business.
Chicago, Oct. 2.—Business condi
tions In the seventh federal reserve
bank district—including the state of
Iowa—continue good, according to the
monthly report from the district head
quarters. The summary of the report
says:
Business' is aetove In almost all
lines, at high prices, with some manu
facturers finding difficulty In Blearing
the necessary raw materials. Labor
la stin in short supply and a deficiency
In available cars is causing inconven
ience to shippers. Bankers report a
general improvement throughout the
district and there appears less criti
cism of the low rates and excess
money than for some months. There
still are centers with a plethora of
funds and low rates, but even In these
cases the undertone is firm and any
active demand would probably show
very promptly in the money quota
tions. Fall business with jobbers and
retailers, which has been dependent on
the crop situation, is increasing, due
to the market value of the produce
rather than the amount harvested. On
the whole, this should prove a reason
ably prosperous year for the agricul
tural communltis, and the manufactur
ing centers are reflecting this condi
tion and also the foreign demand in
special lines. Bond houses anticipate
a revival of business this fall. Munci
pal issues which have been stationary
are now advancing and this territory
Is absorbing a satisfactory volume of
securities. Thre have been few new
offerings, except foreign loans, and in
thees there has been considerable in
terest, particularly the collateral is
sues which are highly regarded by au
thorities in the banking community.
Crops have not Improved since last
month, in fact, the expected yield of
corn has probably been decreased ow
ing to a frost the middle of September.
However, the greater part of the crop
had so far matured that the damago
in all likllhood will be small, centering
in the northern half of Illinois where
the crop was somewhat behind the ad
jacent states in point of maturity. Cur
rent prices for all grain should be giv
en due consideration In determining
the financial outlook for the farmer,
and these are high.

SANTA FE TO FIGHT
THE ADAMSON LAW
New York, Oct. 2.—President E. P.
Ripley of the Santa Fe railway Bystem
has addressed a letter to the stock
holders of the company informing
them that he believes the Adamson
eight-hour law to be unconstitutional
and that steps will be taken to resist
it in every lawful manner.
The letter reviews at length the
controversy between the railroads and
the brotherhoods and the action taken
by President Wilson and congress to
avert the strike which had been fixed
•for September -4.
The letter continues: .•
"The result appears to be that, ac
cording to the view of the government
it is powerless to protect the public
'against any nation-wide combination
on the part of railroad employes to
paralyze by strike all the railroads of
the country.
"Since the precedent of abandoning
arbitration aud hurriedly paying the
demands of railroad unions by special
congressional enactment has thus
been established, does it not behoove
you to exercise your influence in favor
of appropriate remedial legislation?"

SEN. CLARK IS DEAD
Apoplexy Causes Sudden Demise of
President Pro Tem of United
.. States 8enate.
Little Rock, Ark., Oct. 2.—Uatted
States Senator James P. Clarke, presi
dent pro tempore of the United States
senate, died at his home here yester
day.
Senator Clarke, suffered a stroke of
apoplexy Friday and never regained
consciousness. Physicians and mem
bers of his family, however, minimized
the seriousness of his condition so
that the news of his death came as a
shock.
Senator Clarke was 62 years old. His
widow, a son and two daughters sur
vive.
Senator Clarke had been president
pro tempore of the senate since the
democratic party gained control in
1913.
The railroad eight hour bill, which
prevented a nation wide strike, was
passed with Senator Clarke in the
chair, but he was one of two democrat
ic senators to vote against the meas
ure and he refused to sign it He ap
pointed Senator Hughes as acting pres
ident pro tempore when the bill was
presented at the presiding officer's
chair for signature.
Senator Clarke's revolt against the
eight hour bill was a typical manifes
tation of a stern independence which
characterized his attitude throughout
the thirteen years of his senatorial
career. He was many times the lead
er in opposition to measures proposed
by his party.
The Arkansas senator during the
last session again surprised his col:
leagues when he proposed the amend
ment to the Philippine bill which
would rive absolute Independence to
the islands in four years. The adminis
tration indorsed the amendment and
it was adopted by the senate. The
house, however, refused to accept it.

countries. These protests, more of
which arrived today at the depart
ment, are regarded as inspired by pro
fessional politicians and revolution
ists,
No disorders nor attempts to pre
vent absolute freedom at the polls
have been reported.
Distribution of the $3,000,000 Nica
ragua receives under the recent treaty

Reports that American bankers hav
