Attempts (o Supply Market
Are Marked By Acts of
, Violence
New Tork, Oct. 3 Greatly decreas
ed receipts of milk today brought
New Tork to a realization of the seri
ousness of a pure milk, famine. Nor
was there any indication of a break
in the dispute between the ' distributors
and farmers over prices. Big milk
companies admitted that approximate
ly one-half of their usual Supply was
received today.
Hospitals and children have been
looked after 'by the distributors and
so far no complaint of serious short
age has come from any of the large
public institutions.
Rerorts from all parts of New Tork
tell of thousands of gallons of milk
smiled in combats between tne dairy
men and the employes of the distrib
utors, the picketing . of crossroads in
dairy districts, farmers held up ana
beaten, and ( the establishment of
cheese manufactories to dispose of the
surplus resulting from the withhold
ings of New Tork city's supply. Twen
ty deputies have been sworn in Dutch
ess county to prevent raids of farmers
on their neighbors to compel them to
hold back their product.
This followed an attack of one man
who was severely beaten while the
deputy sheriff who accompanied him
was held prisoner and tied to a tree.
Masked farmers are reported to be pa
trolllngne roads in Herkimer, Lewis,
Madison Otsego, - Oneida, Tompkins
and other counties up-state, seizing
mlllk and dumping It. In some places
the farmers are contributing funds to
build co-operative creameries.
John J. Dillon, the state commis
sioner of food and markets, who rep
resents the League of Farmers, estiv
mates that not more than 25 per cent,
of the normal amount of milk was
shipped into. New Tork city for use
today.
City distributors claimed they had
received 60 per. cent, of the 2,500,
000 gallons required daily. Thus far
the shortage has not affected the city
hospitals. '
Application for the appointment1 of
referee to take testimony in an in
vestigation under the direction of At
torney General Woodbury Is expected
to be made to the courts at once. '
The health authorities early today
made good their 'assertion that in
spection rules would not be modified
on account of the milk famine by re
fusing to admit 10,000 gallons from
Herkimer county on the ground that
it was not pasteurized.

New Tork, Oct, 3 Shortly after an
announcement that police guards were
to be removed today from the elevated

trains were attacked. A bullet fired
at a Third avenue elevated train clip
ped a piece from the right ear of a
passenger, Medviller Wright, and fell
to the floor aftr penetrating a mo-
lurmaa s uuuiu. '
The bullet is believed to have come
from o window, as policemen on near
by roofs saw no one. The train Iwas
bound for South Ferry, and the. shot
came from the west side of the ave
nue. It broke a window and grazed
Wright's ear.
Many of the passengers started to
the platforms and policemen on strike
duty had a difficult time quieting
them. All the houses in the neigh'
borhood were searched, without" re
sult. Wright refused medical at
tention and proceeded downtown.
Satisfied that there is little danger
of further violence in the subway as
a Result f the; street railway strike,
the policekdepartment today withdrew
all "policemen from strike duty on the
underground trains. Policemen, how
ever, will be kept on station platforms
for a few days longer. ,
Similar action, it is reported, will be
taken with regard to the elevated
trains as soon as the police have rout
ed the small mands of strikers and
sympathizers who have bombarded the
trains from roof tops in the early,
mornings. . '
Only one policeman instead of two
hereafter will be assigned to each sur

DOOMED DRIVER
SEEMED TO PRAY,
AVERS OBSERVER
Ex-Special ' Policeman Ed
!ward Callahan Eye Wit
ness of Xatal Accident
Edward Callahan, for many (years a
special policeman, . an eye-witness to
the accident described the scene today
in the following words: r
"I was coming from my home at 33
French street to the city yards. I
was standing about ' 100 ' feet north of
the Hall street crossing on , Housatonic
avenue. Green, driving his' truck
seemed to come from Housatonic ave
nue. He was coming along lazily and
started to cross the tracks.
"The engineer of the train which
wa? coming down the tracks seemed
to see him . for he blew his whistle
and continued to blow the danger sig
nal. Green kept right on crossing the
tracks. Suddenly he seemed to wake
up in astonishment. If he had kept
on going he would have been saved.
But he began to pull his horses back
with both'. lines. As the train ap
proached to within five feet of the
team. Green stood up on his little
platform. .'Both hands were extended
upwards as if in prayer but the lines
were clasped tightly in his left hand.
He seemed like a man who had lost
all sense of his surroundings and was
awaiting death.
"The horses were stuck on their
haunches and raised into the air be
fore they hit the freight train stand
ing on the left siding. One was in
stantly killed and never moved. The
other sat ort its haunches and then
fell back and died.
"Green went right up into the air
anil was. hurled about 50 feet. He
struck the left side of the freight
train, ahead of the passenger and
then rolled to the tracks where the
passenger train again hit him and
threw him to the side of the embank
ment There he lay flat on his back,
dead. ' ,
"The train took the siding to the
right and rushed at .what I1 should
Judge a speed of 30 to 35 miles an
hour, until It struck the end of the
freight train to the right of the main
line tracks. The ngine toppled over
into the street and the fireman and en
gineer crawled out There was a dense
pall of cement dust over the whole
scene about a minute afterwards. A
truckman on a Rickard truck had a
narrow escape from , death as he
Jumped out of the way as the toppling
engine came down on his truck. ..
"My instinct after long years as ' a
special policeman was to aid the wom
en and children who seemed stunned
by the experience. All of them we
helped from the train seemed to com
plain of pain in their knees. They
were thrown to the floor yiqlently as
the train catne to a standstill!'' Later
they disappeared in confusion after
they had sat on nearby steps and
porches.
Green Recently In
Superior Court On
Misconduct Charge
Among the personal effects found
by Medical Examiner S. M. Garlick,
when he viewed the body of Edward
L. Green, the teamster, at the morgue
was a clipping which indicates that
E. L. Green and Lulu Wixson of
Trumbull were arrested in this city
upon charges of misconduct preferred
by Fred I. Wixson of Trumbull.
The clipping, which is much worn
from constant handling, asserts that
the Wixson woman was paying court
toGreea and could not be stopped by
pleadings of heryhusband or threats
of the prosecuting attorney and that
the couple were finally arrested.
It is asserted that upon arraignment
in the city court neither Green nor
the Wixson woman offered any de
fense, both being held under bonds of
$1,000 for the superior court, Sep
tember term. The case was nollcd.
Bchrens Children on Train.
Miss Kathcrine Behrens, sister of
F. W. Behrens, Jr., the Fairfield ave
nue marketman was among those on
the train. She was bringing Mr. Beh
rens' three children from their sum
mer home in Trumbull to Bridgeport
for school. They were uninjured,
though greatly upset 'by the shock.

Robert Mack Burns, of 36 Fourth street, East Bridgeport,

of 28 Cottage street, Danbury, both of whom with, the other)
members of the crew had been working nearly 15 hour,, stuakj )

The hiss 6t scalding steam, seemed to bring the dazed en-i

which raised lumps as big as eggs

attendance. -.,) '
, Thomas Hixson, driver of a double horse wagon, who was ,
just pulling up to the demolished freight car to obtain a load of
cement, escaped death in a remarkable manner. . .. ,
Noting with amazement the passenger train speeding down
the spur track and realizing that a collision was inevitable he-
madly turned his roses in an attempt to go south on Ilousatonio - I
avenueand avoid being struck. ,
The horses seeming to comprehend their danger swerved
over onto the sidewalk breaking the shafts and galloped down
the middle f the street. Hixon, who is employed by Chris
Rickard, recovered his sentee in time to see the locomotive in mid
air plunging straight at him. He leaped fromihe team just as
the prow of the locomotive smashed the seat on which he was
sitting into splinters. Bruised

The train which left New Milford
was due in the Bridgeport station at
7:35 and was 7 or 8 minutes late. As
it approached within 100 feet of the
railroad crossing at Hall street, the
coal team, drawn by two valuable
white horses, loomed up in view.
The engineer jammed on his brakes
and madly blew his steam whistle but
Green was too late to turn bacK. Tne
locomotive bore down on him Just as
.the team was half way across the
tracks, passing from west to east,
striking midway between th horses
and the front of the coal cart.
Green was thrown south on Housa
tonic street 60 feet, his legs, arms and
back broken, and his head crushed in.
The horses were hurled to the east
of the tracks, a alstance or u ieei.
landing against a stationary freight
train, and were killed instantly.
By a strange freak, the wagon, lift
ed into the air by cowcatcher of the
engine, landed on the signal arm of
the switch, turning the switch and
shifting the passenger train from the
main track onto the freight siding.
Grinding beneath its wheels the for
ward wheels of the coal team and
carrying them along with the train,
the brakes seeming to fail to stop its
flight, the locomotive 400 feet south
on the spur track, ripped through a
freight car filled with bags of cement.
It seemed to carom off the freight
car, rear itself In the air and then
plunged into the street. The nose of
the errvine, burying itself in the
ground f Housatonic avenue, brought
the trai,- to a stop with a bump that
wrenched loose the platforms of the

The scene of the collision, which
has come to be known as "Death

the section, was Immediately filled !
with hundreds of people.
Wilbur L. Baker, of 644 Xaugatucki
avenue, Devon, and Thomas Kelly, of j
313 South avenue, both employed at;
the Bridgeport Brass Co., hearing the j
blasts of the locomotive whistle, and
knowing the danerousness of the j
crossing, rushed from the gate of thej
brass works to Hall street.
They emerged frW behind a freight!

through the air. Waiting for the
switched train to pass, both workers.
who assert the train was travelling
about 40 miles an hour, went) to1
Green's assistance.
They picked him up, but declared)
the dead man breathed but a few 1
moments after they reached his side. '
The contributing causes to the ac-
