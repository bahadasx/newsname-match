SWEDEN DEFIES
ENTENTE Hi A
STRONG NOTE
•.
Relations Grow Tense as
Neutrality is Brought
Into Question.
BRITAIN QIVEN
VERY HARD RAP
German Subs of Commerce
Traverse Swedish Waters
Freely.
London, Oct 8.—The rotations be
tween Sweden and the entente powers
are becoming somewhat tense. With
the dispute as to mail seizures still
unsettled, there now has arisen the
charge by the entente allies that the
neutrality of Sweden is not so loyal
and Impartial as It should be. This
has drawn from Stockholm a reply,
as tart and crisp as some of the notes
In the mail controversy which were
characterized/ by Viscount Grey as
containing words not usually found In
diplomatic correspondence.
British minister to Sweden, Sir
Esme Howard has been given full
authority to act and is co-operating
with the other entente diplomats at
Stockholm in making representations
as to the latest matters in controversy.
The new point of contact with Swe
den is the outgrowth of the practice
of belligerent shipping in using Swed
ish-i territorial waters for all Baltic
traffic. Within the safety of this neu
tral three-mile limit, English and
other ships of the entente nations
have sailed defiantly into and out of
the Baltic, paying not the slightest
heed to the German fleet looking on
from the outer waters. Similarly.
German merchant ships have sailed
up and down the west coast of Swe
den, heavily laden with foodstuffs and
Iron ores, while Russian destroyers tn
the northern reaches of the Baltic
have been Impotent to act.
Sweden Has Heavy Task.
This practice placed a heavy re
sponsibility upon Sweden and kept
her flee.t busy day and night patroling
the territorial waters in protection of
the belligerent traders, despite which
precautions there were several viola
tions of Swedish neutrality.
..Public sentiment tn Sweden was
aroused and the government deter
mined to mine the waters of Kogruntf
channel leading out of the sound into
the-. Baltic.-
The situation was further compli
cated by a later determination of the
Swedish government to close the
Kogrund channel entlreiv to all ex
cept Swedish vessels. Then the en
tente allies decided to protest. Ac
cording to reports received here there
was much excitement in Stockholm
whan the allied note arrived and It
waa. promptly described by the pro
German papers as an ultimatum. The
entente allies protested that in re
serving exclusively to Swedish mer
chant ships the track across the mine
fields established In the Kogrund
channel, Sweden had closed the only
rout? by which English, French and
other entente-allied vessels could pass
Into 'and out of the Baltic protected
from" attack by German naval forces.
On the other hand, the note pointed
out,-the Swedish government not only
left open In territorial waters between
Kalamar Strait and Lulea. a route
which Is accessible only to Swedish
and German ships under the new ar
rangement but further assured to
these vessels the protection of an es
cort against the Russian naval force.
Sweden's Stiff Reply.
With regard to submarines, the
British protest declared that Sweden
appeared to establish between under
water boats armed for war purposes
and other submarines a distinction,
in virtue of which so-called sub
marines of commerce, a type not em
ployed by the entente allies, might
with Impunity navigate Swedish ter
ritorial waters beneath the surface.
The reply ®f Sweden was character
istically stiff.
"You conclude that In the attitude
adopted by the king's government re
garding thq two belligerent camps
there la a signal difference which
would seetn Incompatible with the
duties of a loyal and Impartial neu
tral," it said. "It is the duty of the
king's government to deny In the
most formal manner that the opinion
thus expressed has any foundation. It
cannot enfer into discussion on the
sincerity afid Impartiality of Its neu
trality, which have been abundantly
demonstrated throughout the war. It
will, however, observe that an alle
gation of this nature is fundamentally
vicious, being founded only on Isolated
facts impfrfectly discernable."

STONE'S THROW OF CARRANZA
SOLDIERS—GRAND FORKS MEN
STATIONED AT HISTORIC SPOT
ON UNE.
(By Staff Correspondent.)
Mercedes. Texas, Oct. 3.—The epi
demic of malaria fever which visited
the camps of the First North Dakota
regiment here and the regiments from
Minnesota, Indiana and Nebraska at
Llano Grande has abated since the
practice of "feeding" the troops
quinine, every evening waa started
several days ago.
Hundreds of men have been sent
from surrounding camps to the camp
hospitals at Llano Grande and
Brownsville, and the base hospital at
San Antonio has been receiving the
most serious cases-
Dengue fever was epidemic for
awhile in the Corpus Christi district,
but has been checked by the army,
medical authorities.
Few of the cases of malaria have
been of a very serious nature and at
the present time men who have been
successfully treated for the malady
are dally returning to their companies.
The malarial season is about over
and medical authorities are more
optimistic about the future. The
heavy rains of Ihe past few months,
causing mosquito-breeding swamps
about military camps, are blamed for
the outbreak of illness.
Outpost Duty.
North Dakotans will have their
first real taste of outpost duty within
nearly a stone's throw of Mexico when
the Third Battalion of the First North
Dakota regiment goes on guard along
the Rio Grande river this week.
On the opposite side of tho river
Carranza soldiers are patrolling Mexi
can soil, which fact makes the duties
of the North Dakotans all the more
interesting.
Companies E of Wllliston and of

ifi Favor of Allies.
London, Oct. 3.—A new political
party, favoring intervention in the
war on the side of the allies is being
formed by Demstrios Gounarls in
Greece, according to an Athens dis
patch to the Havas agency. The dis
patch says the movement meets with
a favorable reception. Dispatches

Venlzeli'st movement.

which was formed in March 1915. He
was defeated by the Venizellsts in the
following June and the cabinet re
signed two months later. Gounarls
subsequently served as minister of the
interior in the Skouloudis cabinet,
and the fall of the administration is
said to be largely due to the opposi
tion of the entente to Gounarls Who
generally has been credited with un
friendly feelings to the Allies.

GREATEST NEWSPAPER
GRAND FORKS, N. D., TUESDAY EVENING, OCTOBER 3, 1916. TEN PAGES—PRICE FIVE CENTS.
Two New U. S. Judges to Hear
Washington, Oct. 3.—The two new
members of the supreme court, Louis
D. Brandels and John H. Clarke will
hear arguments on important cases
for the first time in October.
Brandeis is looked upon Jjy other
members of the court as a "radical,"
with "uplift tendencies." Clarke is
described by friends as a "progres
sive" judge, und his opinions will be
for personal and human rights rather
than property rights.
Brandeis was born in Kentucky
and moved to Boston to practice law.
His appointment caused a nation
wide sensation and desperate efforts
were made by corporation lawyers
and others to defeat his confirmation
in the senate. The opposition to him
was so vigorous and widespread that
the judiciary committee of the senate
did an unusual thing in ordering a
hearing on the protests made against
hia confirmation. The charges
against Mr. Brandeis were, in brief,
that he had "double crossed" clients,
but, after a long investigation, his
nomination was reported to the senate
and confirmed. The appointment was
very distasteful to a majority of the
members of the supreme court, and
there is much speculation as to how
he will be treated by them. He has
I had no experience as judge, but has
been very active in and out of court
for the masses against the classes,
He has an aggressive personality.
1 Associate Justice Clarke was S.
district judge at Cleveland when he
was appointed tn the supreme bench.
He had long been a leading democrat
in his state, several times he was a
candidate for U. S. senator, once op
posing the late Marcus A. Hanna.
On one of these occasions, two and
a half years ago, he said:
"I shall ask the support of the peo
ple because I favored progressive
measures when it was far from popu
lar to do so. 1 favored the direct
election of U. S. senators in the first
argument made for the measure in
1894, and was almost mobbed for do
ing so.
"I have lived very comfortably
without office through what is certain
ly the greater part of my life, and
should not care to enter public life
except, in answer to a very substantial
call, to serve the public with as much
freedom of opinion as have alwavs
expressel in my unofficial life
Mr. Clarke is a man of broad and
varied culture, and has been called
the most gifted orator in Ohio. As
district judge in Cleveland he took
especial interest in the naturalization
and Americanization of the foreign
born.
An investigation into his profes
sional career at the time he was ap
pointed district judge revealed that,

the hotel indicate, the police say. that
a promise of marriage figured in the
woman's trip here. Most of the cor
