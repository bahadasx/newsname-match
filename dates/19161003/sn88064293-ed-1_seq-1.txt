That's the very first questoin that enters
your mind when you o-nr-ider depositing
your money in a bank or making an in
vestment.
It i« a very reasonable and logical question. Money
is hard to earn, and still harder to save. You have a
rijht to DEMAND safety.

AL. C. BARNES CIRCUS COMING
! A splink, Bplankling new show, a
new program—not so new, however,
but what the time-honored features
which have m»Je the circus Amer
ica's most popular form of amuse
ment, are retained, are the promises
held forth for t„e circus that is to
visit Morgan City on Tuesday, Oct.
10th, the world'» greatest wild ani
ma] show—the Al. G. Barnes' big
four-ring wild animal circus. In say
ing "new" show, it isn't inferred
that the Barnes' show is new to the
people of Morgan City for it has
visited here before and is strictly in
keeping with the truth to say that its
performances always give genuine
and wholesome satisfaction.
Acts that thrill, acts that amaze,
others that instruct and those that
, create laughter—all of them entirely
new and of an original character are
, promised to those who witness this
j season's performance. The score of
the feats performed by the animals
has been profusely broadened for
this year's tour. Grown people will
find in the thrilling spectacular acts
a satiating array of entertainment,
while the kiddies will have bushels of
fun watching the antics of the half
hundred animal clowns. The comical
ity of these laugh creators is also
guaranteed to be juvenescent to all
grandpas and grandmas present.
Special attention is directed this
year to the big wild animal features
in which the largest groop of lions,
tigers and bears ever shown are per
formed. Educated Royal Bender
tigers, thirty acrobatic and comedy
bears, the horse-riding lions, bears,
leopards and hyenas will certainly

Acts of a quieter character, but
none the less interesting, in which
domestic animals are the star actors,
are generously interpersed through
out the program. There's a massive
tiful and highly educated ponies take
part. The world'3 champion dancing
horses—sixteen in number are
shown in one of the greatest circus
features of all times. Trapeze per
forming monkeys, tight and slack
rope-walking dogs, monkeys, goats
and pigs, and raging ostrichs, com
