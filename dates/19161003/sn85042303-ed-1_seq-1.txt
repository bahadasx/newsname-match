WEATHER FORECAST
New Orleans, La.. Oct 3.
The weather forecast for Ok
lahoma for tonight is fair and
warmer in the eastern por
tion; Wednesday partly cloudy
and cooler in the western portion.
Judge Ralph E. Campbell, who is
hero holding court, is occupying the
new federal court room for the first
time. The federal building in this
city was accepted by the government
less than a month ago.
"I like the court room," said Judge
Campbell. "It Is smart, but it is larger
than I expected to find from the re
ports I had of the building. The fur
nishings are very nice and the cham
bers are all that coulr oe desired. I
am glud to see the wonderful improve
ments in this city. I was here a year
ago, when Ardmore was bowed In grief
from the explosion which cost the
lives of a half hundred of jour citi
zens, but I appreciate the fact that
you have recovered rroin the catas
trophe and are building n greater
city."
Judge Campbell is one of the most
popular Judges that has ever occu
pied the bench in the eastern or
southern districts of tne state, lie is
a young man, is very active, but is
patient with the bur and with the de
fendants. He is lenaing his full
strength ill the light against the
liquor truffle as was evidenced ye1?-
terday when he ordered the witnesses
in a liquor case placed in Jail on a
charge of perjury. Liquor dealers have
always, in both state and federal
courts, depended largery upon cither
perjured testimony or upon the bad
memory of witnesses and a few cases
liko the one yesterday and men will
quit risking their own liberties to as
sist those who arc cnarged with
liquor violations.
The convening of federal court, to
gether with the grand Jury, has
brought a vast number of attendants
to the city. Witnesses before the
grand Jury are here from all parts of
the district. Among the federal of
ficials here are II. A. Larson of Den
ver, chief special officer with the In
terior department; C. E. Carpenter of
Muskogee, special ot fleer, and T. E.
Brents of Ada, special officer. The
following postofflce Inspectors are
also here: George E. Lewis of Mu3
kogee, O. C. Pierce of Tulsa and W.
A. Hammed of eBaumont, Texas.

"BATTLE CRY OF PEACE" TO PLAY
RETURN DATE.
By special arrangements with the president of the Vitagraph Company,
who is also the producer of "The Battle Cry of Peace," and Harry M. Lowcn
stein, manager of the Pulace Theatre, Tur Arumokkitf. Is pleased to announce
to the people of Ardmore, Carter County and the surrounding counties, that
on Monday night, October 16, this wonderful picture will be reproduced, under
the auspices of The Daily Ardmorelte, at the Palace Theatre.
"The Battle Cry of Peace" as produced here last night, brought forth
more favorable comment than any picture that has ever been presented in
the city, and there were so many people who failed to see it, that efforts were
Immediately started this morning by The Ardmorelte to nave It reproduced,
with the above result
The producers of "The Battle Cry of Peace," at the expense of hundreds
of thousands of dollars, are trying to show the American people the neces
sity of having a Pkw.vrkd Natiox. This wonderful production shows the pos
sibility of an Invading enemy, destroying New York City, the atrocities at
tending such an invasion, the desolation following, the brave Americans
fighting with the spirit of 76. to an unavailing end. The total destruction of
the United States navy all through unpreparcdness.
PreVldent Woodrow Wilson, with his wonderful foresight, began working
on congress for an appropriation at about the fame time tnls picture was
being made, and since that time, throunh his perseverance, congress bas
made appropriation exceeding One niu.iox Doij.aks ror aetense. j
The live ones are looking out now
for the new townsite at Fox to make
a profit out of the sales or rentals of
town lots. Where the four sections.
29, 30, 31 and 32 como together in
township 2 south and 3 west, a city
Is being planned. The owners are:
L. S. Dolman, Apple & Franklin, J. E.
Hamilton, P. C. Dings, N. B Feagln,
Harold Wallace, Walter Gaut and W.
II. Prater.
The name has not been selected, but
It probably will bn railed Gypsy, in
honor of the company that went Into
that wildcat field and had the nerve
to speud about $100,000 in an effort
to develop a big field of oil and gas.
It looks now that the company has
done that very thing, and It Is very
nice that the townsite people should
think of Gypsy for a name. The field
might drift around until It would be
known as the Gypsy reld, Instead of
the Fox field. No one can tell about
that.
There will be some drug stores and
a blacksmith shop and a lumber yard
and some supply stores located up
there now right away so It is said, and
Gypsy, or whatever It will be called,
will soon be a little erty. A star ma
chine which has been on the Uncle
Sam property in Stephens county, will
be moved over to the new townsite
and a water well wilt be drilled and
a town pump will be Installed and the
thirsty hordes will come for miles
around to drink at the town pump.
Edward E. Ertel is to have charge
of the business for the townsite com
pany. He is a lire wire, and knows !
how to get his town before the public.
The interurban out thst way will
make Gypsy Its terminus, and why
should It not grow Into a modern town
almost over night? It will be the
center of a big trade without the oil
field patronage, and that big patron
age at Its door will make It just keep
on growing.
