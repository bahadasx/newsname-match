to
Birmingham, Oct. 3. Viscount
Bryce of Dechmont, former British
ambassador at Washington, address
ing: the Congregational union today,
decried the spirit of hate against the
Germans and the talk of a lasting
trade war. In conclusion he advo
cated a league to restrain aggression
and compel arbitration.
"If there is to be a recurrence of
wars becoming more terrible with the
unceasing advance of science," he said,
"we may well despair of the future."
Lord Bryce recalled that Premier
Asquith, Sir Edward Grey and Mr.
Balfour had expressed energetically
and sincerely the need of such ma
chinery and said that several groups
of thinkers were working out the
plans.
L'nited States Policy of Isolation.
"To establish any machinery for
preserving peace." continued Lord
Bryce, "would be impossible without
the co-operation of the neutral states
and especially the greatest of all the
neutral states. We have been waiting
and watching to see whether America
would, in view of the immense inter
ests at stake, depart from her old
policy of complete isolation and bear
her part in the effort for securing a
permanent alliance for peace. An in
fluential league for that purpose has
already been formed there and now
two momentous events have hap
pened, on which I dwell because they
have been little noticed here.
"President Wilson delivered, four
months ago, a powerful and luminous

Yon Tirpitz Party Bent on Un
restricted Warfare
Berlin, Oct. 3. Efforts of the Von
Tirpitz party to force a resumption of
submarine warfare will be defeated as
the result of the conferences now be
ing held in secret sessions of the
reichstag committee, it is now gen
erally believed. The Tirpitzites, how
ever, hope to force a public discussion
of the whole question when the reich
stag reconvenes Thursday.
Ernest Basserman, gray-haired na
tional liberal party leader and one of
the most important figures in the
reichstag, declared today after the
question has been aired in the budget
committee meetings, it will be fully
discussed in open session.
We wish to live in peace and
friendship with 'America, said Bas-
sermen, "but undoubtedly there is bit
ter feeling here because American
supplies of ammunition enable our
enemies to continue the war. If
America should succeed in forcing
England to obey international law,
restore freedom of the seas and pro
ceed with American energy against
England's brutalization of neutrals, it
would have a decisive influence on the
political situation between the two
countries.
"Do you think submarine warfare
will be renewed? he was asked.
"That must be decided by the for
eign office, the ministry of marine
and the general staff," was the reply.
"England is our chief enemy. We
must recognize this and defeat her."
GIRL WILLING TO
GIVE ONE OF HER
. EYES TO SOLDIER
Paris, Oct. 3. A young English girl
has written to Dr. Rochen Duvigneaui
offering to give one of her eyes to a
soldier who has lost his sigh, serving
France.' The girl, who lives In North
Shields, had read a recent statement
by Dr. Duvigneaud, one of the famous
occulista in France, that it vas pos
sible to save the sight of a man
wounded in the eye ly grafting a por
tion of the cornea of another person.
In her letter she said:
"If you believe there is one chance
of success in a million, I will give you
one of my eyes for a soldier who ht-.s
lost his sight serving France, I wcul'
prefer to give my eye to one to whom
it would be especially useful, such as
an inventor or an officer of great
value.
"If my offer is accepted, I shall
sider myself under an obligation to

i my country in the only way possible

MAY BEMURDER
Was Man Who Died in Jail
Killed ly Negro J
Coroner's Jury Doesn't BelieTe
Fall Was Fatal.
HE . ROLLED JFHOW A TABLE
Later He Engaged in Fist Fight
With a Prisoner.
Blow Under Chin Sent Him
Reeling to the Floor.
Ed Bennett, who died in the city jail
Saturday night, and whose death was
attributed to a fall from a table while
in an intoxicated condition, may haye
been murdered.
A coroner's jury, after delving into
the evidence for three hours today,
thought enough of it to continue the
hearing until 9 o'clock Wednesday In
order to secure testimony from other
witnesses.
The testimony today tended to show
that while Bennett did fall from a
table in the city jail, he walked around
fcr half an hour after that and felt
sufficiently spry to engage in a fist
fight with a prisoner named Robert
Frost, a light colored negro. Frost, it
was testified today, struck Bennett on
,the chin, knocking hjm. down. He
"did not rise after that. -
Lew Day and Dick Campbell, two
men who were prisoners in the city
jail Saturday night, told of Bennett's
actions during the evening.
Jumped Like a Monkey.
They testified that he was brought
in drunk and lay down on a table in
the jail; that he rolled around and fell
off the table but got up and walked
around. Later, they said, he got into
an altercation with another prisoner,
who threatened to hit him with a
shovel. Frost, they said, was on top
of one of the cages, but dropped down
while the row was on and struck Ben
nett a blew on the chin.
Bennett was placed in a bunk. The
two prisoners said they all supposed
he was simply drunk. He did not rouse
up and early Sunday morning they
noticed he was breathing too rapidly.
They then reported his case to the
jailer.
Dr. H. L. Clark, city physician, took
the stand and took up the thread of
the story. He testified that when he
called at the city prison Bennett was
unconscious and was breathing rapid
ly. He examined him carefully and
found a discoloration back of the
right ear, found a scalp wound on the
back of the head and dried blood in
the canal of the right ear.
He called Dr. Merrill Lindsay and
when he returned to Bennett the latter
was dead. Dr. Lindsay went on the
stand and told of the examination he
made after Bennett died. He de
scribed the fracture of the skull over
the right ear and the blood clot which,
he said, undoubtedly caused death.
Dr. Clark expressed doubt that the
injury could have been caused by fall
ing from the table. Dr. Lindsay stated
it was doubtful that the blow causing
the fracture was directly over the
fracture.
Storm Moving North.
Washington, Oct. 3. The weather
bureau still awaited definite reports
today on the weather disturbance off
the east Florida coast. Advices today
indicated that its intensity was not
known and that it probably whs mov

JAP CABINET OUT
Okuma Regime Resignation Is
a Big Surprise.
Bribery Charges Against Mem
ber Precipitated Crisis.
Tokio. Oct. S. The Nichi Nichi
Shimbun, in an extra edition, an
nounces the cabinet of Premier Count
Okuma has decided to resign. The
premier is said to have stated that he
would recommend "to the emperor the
appointment of Viscount Takaaki
Kato as his successor.
Washington, Oct. 3. The resigna
tion of Count Okuma has been ru
mored for a long time, it was said at
the Japanese embassy here today, but
no official word has been received that
the resignation has been tendered.
I In the absence of such word em
! bassy attaches refused to discuss'-the
j probable cause for the action of the
'cabinet premier. It is the belief here,
j however, that Okuma's resignation re
I suited from the fact that he had
i ceased to have a controlling voice in
ithe affairs of the Japanese govern-
ment.
The cabinet which he heads Is a
coalition cabinet and he has not had
a majority of supporters in it. Count
Okuma offered his resignation more
than a year ago along with the resig
nations of the other members of his
cabinet, but the emperor was un
willing to accept it.
Bribery Charges Brought.
The premier's action resulted from
ihe belief that he should hold himself
responsible for the action of all mem
bers of the cabinet which was then of
his own organization. '
The emperor had accepted the
resignation of Home Minister Oura,
whose withdrawal resulted from
charges of bribery, and the premier
and others immediately offered to
step down. The emperor summoned
the elder statesmen into conference
and afterward Okuma was urged to
remain.

Chicago, Oct. Z. Edward S. Lacey,
Chicago banker and former comptrol
ler of the currency, died here last
night. He was born in Chili, X. Y 81

Serbs Capture First Line
Trenches Xear Fiorina
London, Oct. 3. The Rumanian
force which invaded Bulgaria Sunday
is believed to be moving southward
against the important Rustchuk
Varna railway. The size of the army
that crossed the Danube is not known
here, but English military critics to-
day declared they believed it was com
posed of at least 20,000 men. They
pointed out that a smaller force would
be pinned against the bank of the
river by the Bulgars and would meet
the same fate as the Rumanian gar
rison that attempted to retreat across
the river from Tutrakan fortress.
Ituss Strategy Helps.
At the same hour that Rumanians
invaded Bulgaria, the Kuwo-Kuman-ians
in Dobrudja launched a series of
heavy attacks, apparently to prevent
the Teutons from shifting forces from
that region. The battle is going on i
viin ine Kusso-Kumanlans exerting
heavy pressure against the enemy
flanks.

again hindered operations yesterday.
