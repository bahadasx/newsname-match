London, Sept. 22. The relations be
tween Sweden and the entente powers
are attracting unusual attention here
and there Is every indication that the
situation threatens to bee, me some
what tense. With the dispute as to
mail seizures still unsettled, there now
has arisen the charge by the entente
that the neutrality of Sweden is not
so loyal and Impurtial as it should be.
This has drawn from Stockholm a re
ply as tart and crisp as some of the
notes in the. mall controversy, which
were characterized by Viscount Grey
as containing words not usually found
in diplomatic correspondence.
Confidence is expressed In the tact
and ability of the British minister to
Sweden, Sir Ksnte-Howard, to handle
Cleat Britain's Interests, for he al
ready has done much to smooth over
many point! Of friction that has aris
en since the war begh. Sir Ksme has
l en given full authority to act In the
mails dispute ami is co-operating with
the other entente diplomats at Stock
holm in making representations as to
the latest matters in controversy.
New point d oil tact,
The new point of contact with Swed
en is the outgrowth of the practice of
belligerent hipping in uaing Swedish
territorial waters for all Baltic traf
fic Within the safety of this neu
tral three-mile limit, KliKllsh and oth
er ships of the entente nations have
sailed defiantly Into and out of the
Battle, ,e,L pwytftg the h, ig litest heed
tn the Herman fleet looking on from
the outer waters. Similarly, Herman
ships have sailed up old down the
west coast of Sweden, heavily laden
with foodstuffs and iron ores, while
Russian destroyers in the northern
reaches of the Baltic have been Impo
tent to act.
This practice placed a heavy re
sponsibility upon Sweden and kept
her fleet busy day anil night patroll
ing the territorial waters in protec
tion of the belligerent traders, des
pite which precaution! there were
several violations of the Swedish neu
trality. Public sentiment in Sweden
was aroused and the government de
termined to mine the waters of Ko-
grund channel, leading out of the
sound into the Baltic. Sweden also
Served notice that her naval com
manders had been instructed to fire
upon all submarines found prowling
within the three-mile limit. This pol
icy scarcely, had been announced,
when news came of the successful
trip of the Deutsehland from Bremen
to Baltimore, and there arose the
question as to whether Swedish war
ships would fire at sight of a German
merchant submarine, or whether they
would only fire at entente allied sub
marines, knowing these powers were
not using commercial underwater
boats.
further Complication-.
The situation was further ooniple at
'd by a later determination of the
Swedish government to close the Ko
grund channel to all except Swedish
vessels. Then the entente allies decld
Bd to protest. According to reports
received here, there was much excite
ment in Stoc kholm when the entente
allied note arrived, and it was
promptly described by the pro-German
papers as an ultimatum.
The entente allies protested that in
reserving exc lusively to S;edlsh mer
chant ships the track across the mine
fields established in the Kogrund
Channel, Sweden had closed the only
route by which English, French and
other entente allied vessels could pass
Into and out of the Baltic protected
'row attach by German naval forces.
n the other hand, the note pointed

W,th regard to submarines, the
