NEW YORK, Oct. 3.—Despite all
sorts of rumors regarding slip-ups,
the property man in charge of the
Dear Will and Dear Theodore drama,
to be staged tonight at the Union
League club, insisted today he would
be able to produce some 466 pounds
of ex-and about 170 pounds of Iioiio

tion of Governor Hughes tonight Ex
President Taft confessed 266 pounds
upon arriving here today from New
Haven. He lead former President
Roosevelt by some sixty-six pounds.
The evening's meeting between
Taft and Roosevelt will be the first
time they have reached speaking dis
tance since 1914 when they were
coldly formal at a funeral in New
Haven of a mutual friend.
Referring to the love feast as a
"crow eating contest," Chairman Mc

Possibly he will say something about
his friend Jeremiah O'Leary of the

Hughes may not know the gentleman,
there is no question that O'Leary is

Marshall Gets Tanned.
KANSAS CITY, Mo., Oct. 3.—Pro

would answer the tanning handed him
last night by J. Frank Hanly when he
characterized President Wilson's run
ning mate as a "national calamity."
The dry leader also charged President
Wilson and Governor Hughes were
afraid to face the prohibition Issue
apd rapped Taft and Fairbanks for
their attitude on these questions, but
he saved his warmest lashing for the
vice president, declaring "he is the
national calamity In that should Wil
son be re-elected and by providential
Interference be taken from executive
power, Riley Marshall, who has done
more business on less capital than any
man I ever knew, would become presi
dent.
"Marshall made an abject surrender
to the liquor traffic. And I found that
he had confessed in a message which
he wrote and addressed to the In
diana legislature asking that the dry
law in effect in that state be repealed
because he, as governor, could not
enforce it."

Publis Discussion of the Whole Situa

[By Carl W. Ackerman, United Press

BERLIN, Oct. 3.—Efforts of the
Von Tlrpitz party to force a resump
tion of submarine warfare, will be
defeated as the result of conferences
now being held in secret sessions of
the reichstag committee, it is now
generally believed.
The Tirpitzites, however, hope to
force a public discussion of the
whole question when the reichstag
reconvenes Thursday.
Bm
tional liberal party leader and one
of the moBt important figures in the
reiohstag, declared today after the
question has been aired in the budget
committee meetings, it will be fully
discussed in open session.
We wish to live in peace and
friendship with America," said Bass
ermaii, "but undoubtedly therp is bit
ter feeling here because American
supplies of ammunition enable our
enemies to continue the war.
'If America should succeed in
forcing England to obey international
law, restore freedom of the seas and
proceed with American energy
against England's brutilization of
neutrals, it would have a decisive in
fluence on the political situation
•between the two countries."
"Do you think submarine warfare
will be renewed he was asked.
"That must be decided by the for
eign office, the ministry of marine
and the general staff," was the re
ply. "England is our chief enemy.
We must recognize this and defeat
her."
