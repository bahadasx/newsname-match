not in their nature confiscatory ,and
which do not involve the practical
confiscation of their property, and
make possible the operation of their
properties.

public the memorandum presented by
the mining men and said that the com
missioners would confer with them
again tomorrow. They came here at
the request of the American commis
sioners who wanted their statements

value of the maneuver seemingly is
two-fold.
