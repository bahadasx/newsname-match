DAIRYMEN'S LEAGUE IS GROWING
City Receiving Only 60 per cent of
Normal Supply and Receipts Will
Decrease
New York, Oct. 3. Now York Cily
received only about CO per cent of its
usual daily supply of 2,400,000 quarts
of milk yesterday, with the prospect
that this quantity would be further
reduced today by one-third to one-half.
Men in touch with the milk market
based this estimate on reports from
milk-producing centres which told of
, the increasing strength of the Dairy
men's League, the organization of
farmers who have created the situa
tion in this city by declining to seel
their product to the big distributers
except through the medium of their
league.
Officials of the larger companies
here asserted that they could meet the
emergency, in part at least, by divert
ing to the retail trade in th(s city all
the milk and cream ordinarily used
for the manufacture of butter, cheese,
and condensed and evaporated milk.
The shortage of milk is admittedly
so acute, however, that Attorney Gen
eral Egburt K. Woodbury announced
in Albany yesterday that he would
commence at once a thorough inquiry
into the situation.
The shortage was felt more keenly
yesterday in the suburbs than in Man
hattan. ' Most of the nearby towns are
dependent on the New York distribut
ing companies for their supply. The
companies were able, to supply a largo
percentage of their city customers yes
terday, but many Long Island patrons
went without milk altogether or re
ceived less than their standing orders
called for.

velt, appeared as a defendant before
Justice of the Peace Frank P. Seaman
at Mineola, L. L., yesterday, to answer

mobile along the Jericho Turnpike at
thirty-five miles au hour, the court
room was thronged with persons curi
ous to see how he would plead.
"Do you wish an adjournment in or
der to obtain counsel, Mr. Roosevelt?"
asked the court.
"No, your honor, I'll just throw
myself upon the mercy of the court,"
responded the defendant, but the court
fined him $25, which Mr. Roosevelt
paid.
GERMAN SAILORS IN RANKS
Naval Fighters Among Prisoners
Captured by British.
British Frant in France, Oct. 2.
The British forces on this front were
surprised to find among the prisoners
taken last night sailors from the Sec
ond German Naval Division, which
had been rushed to the Somrnc front.
These sailors were employed for the
first time outside of Belgium, where
they had been kept for two years with
their naval guns, which guard the
coast.
As fresh troops are taking the
places of the battered and exhausted
regiments thrown into tho melee feroc
ious fighting at close quarters Is de
veloping near the Echwaben Redoubt
and along tho neighboring old first

World's Series Will Probably Be
gin on Friday
BROOKLYN LEADS IN NATIONAL
Race Developing a "Neck and Neck"
Finish Between Dodgers and
Champions.
It appears almost certain that the
opening games of the world's series
will be played at Braves field in Bos
ton beginning the 6th or 7th. The sug
gestion has been made to the na
tional commission that the usual for
malities of tossing a coin for the privi
lege of staging the initial contest be
dispensed with this season and the
first two games awarded to Boston
Americans. The suggestion is put for
ward by the officials of the latter club
and In all probability will be adopted
by the commission if acceptable to the
National league club owners, who are
considering the proposition.
The Boston American league club
authorities have said that they have
arranged to play their games at
Braves field and that park, with its
seating capacity for 42.000 specta
tors, is ready for the opening games.
while neither the Brooklyn nor Phil
adelphia National league club Is jus
tified, in view of the closeness of the
National league pennant race, in In
stating additional stands and boxes
until it is settled which of tho two
clubs will meet the winner of the
American league pennant.
If the first two games arc played in
Boston, the National league pennant
winning tiuD will have between four
and five days in which to prepare
additional seating accommodations for
the fans and since both parks are
comparatively small the loss of a Sat
urday game will make little difference
in the receipts as the teams will play
to capacity on any day of the week.
If the plan is adopted, as appears
likely, it may be that the opening
game will be played on Friday, in or
der to permit the shift after the first
two games, to be made between Satur
day night and Monday morning.
Philadelphia enjoyed another brief
stay in first place in the National
league race yesterday, the home team
ousting Brooklyn from the lead by
winning the first game from Boston,
2 to 0. and then dropping back to
second place by losing the second con
test by 4 to 1 at Philadelphia, while
Brooklyn was shutting out New York.

BOSTON
TO EXTEND WATER MAINS
Commissioners Discussed Plans at
Monday Evening's Meeting.
The board of water commissioners
held its regular monthly meeting Mon
day evening when the bills for Septem
her were audited and a number of
matters relative to the system were
discussed.
Considerable time was given to the
subject of water main extensions. At
the last annual village meeting an
appropriation was made for wa,ter
main extensions. Tho appropriation
has not been used and Monday even
ing several residents living In the lo
cality near the paint of tho Twin State
sent at the meeting and urgeJ. that
pipe lines be lam to tiieir in-r .-rues.
The house owners present were Instru
mental In having the article which re
sulted in the appropriation placed In
the warning for the village meeting
and tho majority opinion of the com
missioners apparently is in lavor of
making the first extensions in this lo
cality. Such an extension would also
carry the village water to tho sites of
two double tenements which A. S.
Payne, the brush manufacturer, pro
poses to build to accommodate his em
ployes. Superintendent Mahau was
Instructed to investigate tho condi
tion.;. A representative of the Eddy Valve
company of Waterviliet was present
at tho meeting to urge the adoption by
tho village of hydrants manufactured
by the company.
OBJECTED TO PICTURES
"Subjects" of Traveling Photographer
Appeal to Village Clerk.
A traveling photographer with a
rapid-working camera has been in the
village since Monday taking pictures
or persons and groups of people for a
series to be thrown on the screen at
the opera house next week. He has
been at work principally on Main
street and Monday when near the Go
kay drug store two women objected to
being photographed and protested vig
orously to tho camera man.
The photographer says that he en
tered into no argument with the two
women as he had made no attempt to
take their pictures. Later the two
women appeared at the office of Vil
lage Clerk W. P. Ilogan and entered
a protest. The clerk was unable to
give them any t:f.fron. So-4'ar as
Mr. ilogan knew there was no village
ordinance which would prevent a pho
tographer from taking pictures on the
street and as the camera man was of
fering nothing for sale there was no
rule of the trustees whereby he could
be made to pay a license.
The photographer will be in town
during the remainder of the week and
the slides from which the pictures will
be used at the opera house, will be pro
duced at the theatre next week.
TWICE ACROSS AMERICA
Another New Record for the Hudson
Super Six
San Francisco, Cal., Sept. 24. The
Hudson Super-six which arrived in
New York, Sept. 18 utter shattering
the record for the trip from San Fran
cisco to New York by 15 hr. has re
turned to San Francisco, the elapsed
time for the round trip being 10 days,
21 hr. and 3 min. The elapsed time be
tween New York and San Francisco
was 5 days. 17 hr. and 32 min. as
against 5 days, 3 hr. and 31 min. for
the journey eastward.
Remaining in New York only long
enough to replenish gasoline and lubri
cating oil and give the drivers a
chance for some rest, tho car was
started back to San Francisco on Sept.
18 at 10.50 p. m. It was checked out
of New York by James A. liemstreet
of the American Automobile Assn.
who checked it in on its eastward
journey.
Drivers the Same
Tho same drivers had the car in
charge In its second transcontinental
dash, Ralph Mulford, A. II. Patterson
and C. 11. Vincent alternating at tho
wheel.
The total distance traversed was a
trifle less than 7000 miles (6052), and
the average daily mileage was about
700.
On tho return journey heavy rains
were encountered which caused the
drivers to go through the Sierra Neva
da mountains, thus Increasing tho dis
stance. But for this, the time, accord
ing to ts drivers, would have been
about 15 hr. less. The last stretch to
tho Pacific Coast required 35 hr.,
whereas tho same distance was cocr

FLY EXTERMINATION.
Chicago School of Sanitary Instruction
Issues Some Suggestions.
A recent Issue of the bulletin of the
Chicago school of sanitary instruction
makes sumo Interesting comments on
fly extermination, from which the fol
lowing suggestions are taken:
Dead files nre dangerous and should
not 1 o bandied by children. In somo
towns and cities the authorities ore
pnyinp; the children n stipulated price
per hundred for Hies killed. A safer
plan would l.o to pay by the pint or
quart. This would Involve less han
dling of these dead insects, which have
germs on their feet and bodies. Demi
flics may be just as dangeroiw ns live
ones.
Another phase of fly oxtermlnntlon
work that deserves attention is the use
;f poisonous substances for (lest roving
these household pests. Not only the
arsenical poisons, but nil the insectldos
now knows, nre dangerous. They
honul nhv.'ijs be used with extreme
care and should be so placed that chil
dren cannot possibly reach them.
The bulletin recommends as an in
sect Hp n mixture of two tablcspoon
fuls of formaldehyde with one pint,
equal parts, of milk and water. Flics
swarm on the back porch when at
tnictfd by the odors of cooking In the
kitchen. Keep the back porch clean
nnd free from anything that flics can
feed on. rince the fly poison on shal
low -dittos In which several squares
of bread have been put. Tho recepta
cles containing this mixture should be
placed outside the home rather than in
It unless tho screening facilities havn
been neglected and the flics have had
free access to the house.
The trapping, killing nnd effective
extermination of flics should be done
outside of the home. In the Impor
tant work of ridding n community of
tiles It has been established that in
stead of swat tins the fly we should
swat thr- places where the flies breed.
If this has been done the flics In any
community will be reduced to n minimum.

HIGH PRICES IN ITALY
Sugar, Coffee and Butter Way Up
Coal Still $50 a Ton.
Rome, Italy, Oct. 3. The high
cost of living and particularly the
price of coal i3 becoming a subject of
grave concern in Italy as another war
winter approaches. Due to continued
excessive freight rates by sea many
staple food articles are dearer in
Italy than either France or Knglaud. '
Despite a special treaty with Eng
land for cheaper freight rates to be
obtained by the Inrtning of ships; sug
ar is selling at 20 cents a pound and
can bo bought only in small quan
tities, for household consumption from
day to day. Coffee sells at 5o to 70
cents a pound, according to grade.
Though Italy is a heavy producer of
wines, a table wine that once sold at
six ceau't i.ow r.;ij for H
cents and is inferior to the old six
cent grade. Beer is sold at li cents
a epiart, milk at 10 cents. Good butter
is 55 cents a pound.
Coal that before the war sold at $10
a ton now sells at $50 and the price
may go higher as winter comes.
I.aht inter it was $30 to $40 a ton.
Italy hopes to import 750.000 tons
frcm England and 250.000 tons from
tho United States for Industrial uses
this winter.
FOSTER SEEKS PARDON
Is Serving 13 Years for Murdering a
Neighbor
Brattleboro, Sept. 30 .Lou A. Foster
of Halifax, who was sentenced Nov.
11, 1913, by Judge Willard W. Miles to
serve not less than 13 years nor more
than 15 years at hard labor in the state
prison at Windsor for tho murder of
his neighbor, Ossie Prouty, is seeking
a pardon.
A petition is being circulated in his
behalf in Halifax ami neighboring
towns. Letters from him, typewritten
on paper hearing the heading "L. A.
Foster, Windsor, Vt.," have been re
ceived here asking for aid in obtaining
a pardon from the governor.
V. It. Daley, who was one of Fst
ci's counsel at the time of his trial,
said that he did not know that such a
petition was in ciruculation, but that;
lie was not surprised to hear of it. He
said he did not know what might be '
the basis for the petition.
Foster and Prouty had had trouble
and on Oct. 16, 1M13, Foster shot and
killed Prouty as the latter was passing

BRITISH LOSE 307,169
Casualties of 3,600 a day During
Month of September.
London, Oct. 1. Bliitish looses in
September were at the rate of more
than 3. S00 a day. The casualties on
all fronts reported in this month were:
Officers. 5,4:1!); men, 114,110.
Heavy as wero the British looses in
September, they were lighter than
those of August, which were 127,!)45, a
daily average of 4,127. In July, the
the first month of tho Somme offen
sive, the losses were about half those
of August, or September, notwithstand
ing the fact that the British stormed
the first line Gorman defenses then.
The casualties in that month were
5!), 675, so that the total for the three
months of the Sommo drive is 307,
163. Since January 28 the British govern
ment has Issued no figures of total los
ses. Up to that time the daily aver
age of losses from tho beginning of the
war was slightly more than 1,000. Al
though the casualties at present are
about four times those of the first 16
months of the war. this increase is
due not only to the offensive opera
tions now in progress, but to the fac.t
that Great Britain's forces in the field
are far greater than In. the earlier
period of the war.
GENERAL ELECTRIC
STRIKE ENDS AT
PITTSFIELO
Ken Accept Proposal of Comapny
and Return to Work
GAINED BUT FEW CONCESSIONS
Notices Posted Yesterday Providing
for 5 Per Cent Increase
Beginning Oct. 1.
Pittsfleld. Oct. 3. The strike at the
works of the General Electric com
pany is ended. The report of the slrik
ers' committee was adopted by the
strikers yesterday afternoon. This re
port recommended the acceptance of
the proposition of General Manager
Cummings C. Chesney of the plant.
Reports that leaked out from the
strikers' meetings were to the effett
that Pittsfleld and Schenectady (N.
Y.) leaders told the strikers they
would be fools not to accept tha
proposition of the company, inas
much as the support of the Schenec
tady workers, promised the Pittsfleld
workers by international leaders be
fore they struck, had not been ac
corded them. Strikers stated yester
day afternoon that they expect to re
sume work Thursday morning.
General Manager Chesney said yes
terday that the proposition which the
strikers had voted to accept was sub
stantially the same as that submitted
to them on September 27 through the
state board of ocnciliation and arbi
tration, and which at that time was
paid to be tho final proposition, that
the company would make. There
were some adjustments of minor de
tails but these do not. affect the
proposition in general and the vital
features remain as the proposition
came from the hands cf tho company.
There was no change in regard to the
election of the shop committee, the
company stated.
The company stated yesterday aft
ernoon that the idea of having the
men go back in a body Is to expect
too much, as conditions at the plant
are not normal. Mate''al is not on
hand to give the men "work, but they
will be taken back as fast as possible
and given their old positions. The com
pany states that It would be impossi
ble to resume at once tho busy condi
tions that existed before the strike
was started on September 2. The
number of hands employed then was
about 6000. Now it is about 50 per
cent of that number.
Official notice was posted in the
plant yesterday providing for the 5 per
cent increase promised by Mr. Ches
ney on October 1. A shope vote pro
posed for yesterday will be taken at a
later date to determine the number
of hours to constitute a week's work.
Men brought to the city to act as
guards at the plant have been let go
by the company. The official state
ment of the company yesterday said
that Slot men were at work, of which
2272 were of the producing force.
ASK ROOSEVELT FOR MORE
But Colonel Hesitates to Increase
Speeches for Hughes.
Oyster Bay, N. Y.. Oct. 2. Georgo
W. Perkins, on behalf of the Repub
lican National Committee, visited Sag
a more Hill today and pleaded with
Colonel Roosevelt to increase the num
ber of speeches lie is to make for tho
Republican ticket, pointing out that
Republican leaders throughout tho
country w ere clamoring for the Roose
velt "punch," a demand that has be
come more insistent since the Col
onel's Battle Creek speech last Satur
day. The Colonel appeared gratified,
but he did not promise to make any
more speeches than he has already
contracted for. He did not definitely
refuse, however, and it Is possible that
after his conference in New York to
