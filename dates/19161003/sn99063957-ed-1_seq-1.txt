II SUBMARINE W
WILL NOT
Von Tirpitz Party Want This But It Is Believed Thei; Attempt
Will Be Defeated Rumanian Army Invad Bulgaria
and Violent Battle Is Now Being Fought-alians Pre

By Carl W. Ackerman,.
(United Press Staff Correspondent.) ' " '
Berlin, Oct. 3. Efforts of the Von Tripitz party to
force a resumption of submarine warfare will be defeated
as the result of the conferences now being held in secret
sessions of the reichstag committee, it is now generally
believed.
The Tirpitzites, however, hope to force a public discus
sion of the whole question when the reichstag recon
venes Thursday.
Ernest Basserman, gray haired, national liberal party
leader and one of the most important figures in the
reichstag, declared today after the question has been
v aired in the budget committee meetings, it will be fully
discussed in open sessions.
"We wish to live in peace and friendship with Amer
ica," said Basserman, "but undoubtedly there is bitter
feeling here because American supplies of ammunition
enable our enemies to continue the war.
"If America should succeed in forcing England to obey
international law, restore freedom of the seas and pro
ceed with American energy against England's brutaliza
tion of neutrals, it would have a decisive influence on the
political situationbetvveen the two countries."
"Do you think submarine warfare will be renewed?"
he was asked.
"That must be decided by the- foreign office, the min
istry of marine and the general staff," was the reply.
"England is our chief enemy. We must recognize this
and defeat her."

Of the great number of innovations
inaugurated at the state fair this year
that which met with the grnteiui np-(
probation of the general public was the
room-registration bureau which was con

to be exact, A,Mi .rooms representing;
jncomuiodations for over 5,000 visitors to

dium of this agency and it proved a
Lhuppy -solution to the - multitude of
' griefs which have been suffered during
previous stttto t:-irs ny strangers nu

prior to their arrival. Two competent
utteudunts were kept in charge of this
department and, thiough the co-opera-jtiou
of the housewives of Salem and the
! hotel and lodging houso keepers, tne
big rush of transients during the three
j heavy days of the exposition was hand
, led to the credit of tho fair board and

Angry Farmers Attack Milk
Wagons and Literally
"Spill the Milk"
New York, Oct. 3. Only 25 to 35 per
cent of tho usual milk supply reached
New York today according to varying
estimates from both aides of the big
milk strike. Hospitals and the babies
still hid their share of fresh milk, but
restouioiits in many cases were without
any and householders found only small
poitic-nu of their required amounts at
their doors this morning.
Meantime state authorities rushed
work on an investigation of both the
alleged distributing and producing com
bines now at loggerheads. A referee
will take testimony in an effort to
ascertain if the dairymen's league the
farmers organization is a combination
in restraint of selling and whether tha
Big Three distributors are guilty of
any price fixing conspiracy.
The distributors aro making a bitter
fight on Food Commissioner Dillon. One
charged him today with being interested
from the commission standpoint. Dil
lon retorted with "liar."
Meantime the health department de
clines to let down tho barH to unpastuer-
lzed milk and hence no relief at pres
ent is in sight. - ',. . '; : J
The distributors are doing their ut
most to get distant supplies but tTiey
admit that probably by Thursday, the
full pinch of fumine will bo upon the
city unless unforeseen events devolop.
Civic organizations began today to
take a hand in tho fight. Realizing
that continuance of the struirirle may

Miousauds of children tho housewives'
league called a session for this after

Czar, Ruler of Millions,
Works Longer Hours
Then Poorest of Them
By William Phillip Sitiuns.
(United Press staff correspondent.)
Imperial Headquarters, Russian
Army, Hcpt. 4 (By mail.) Czar Nich
olas, ruler of Russia's millions and
commander in chief of her armies,
works hnrder than any millionaire in
Wall street. He puts in more hours a
day than American trade unions al
low by just about as much ngaiu. And
lie lies down to sleep at night on n
folding camp bed, hard and springless
made of canvas.
The emperor was on his way to work,
walking through the rain, when I saw
him. He looks liko his pictures except
that he .is quite brown from living
much in the open. Ho walks with an
athletic swing. Life ut the front seenu
to agree with him.
Lvery soldier within view stood at
rigid salute us he appeared in the door
way of the rather modest two story
house where he had his quarters. The
czar responded. (Stepping forward n
few paces he shook hands with one ot
his officers and despite the drizzle,
stood in the open door about half a min
ute talking. He wore neither overcoat
nor waterproof, being dressed simply in
the regulation khaki and black boots.
He hurried on through the rain to the
offices of the generul staff, n hundred
yards away, followed by two aides de
camp and Joy, tho 12 your old crown
prince's mongrel, which, not being in

FAMILY RIDES AUTO
DOWN 1 50JF00T BLUFF
Made the Trip Safely Despite
the First Drop Was
Sheer Fifty Feet
Ukiah, Cal., Oct. 3. Clarence W, H.
Walker, wife aud two little children,
had a miraculous escape from death
late yesterday when their big touring
car crashed down a precipitious bluf in
to a canyon a hundred and fifty feet
below.
The Walkers arrived in Ukiah today
by stage and told their story.
Walkers apparently bears a charmed
life. Pour years ago he was an aviat
or. In Honolulu during a flight he fell
450 feer into the treetops, escaping
without a scrnsrh.
. In yesterday's tumble not one of the
occupautiwas even bruised. The Walk
ers vere en route to Ukiah from Ban
Praueisco when the steering gear broke
and the machine plunged headlong over
tho cliff. For 50 feet it -was a sheer
drop. Then the big touring car tore
throuph a patch of dense brush, break
ing off a tree four Inches in diameter.
Walker applied the brakes, and at
tempting to hold the car straight with
one hand, he threw the children under
the cowl with the other. Ho cruoched
low nnd shouted to his wife to lie down
in th' touneau.
Whu-.i the nind descent of the automo
bile was finally stopped by the brush,
the Walkers found themselves 150 feet
below' th.' road and without i scratch.
The only damage to the machine was
tho smashing of one front wheel and the
bending of a front axle. The glass
panes of the headlight were intact.
Wnlkcr's driving goggles were torn
off in the descent and were left hang
ing on the bough of a tree.
Leaving tho machine, the Walkers
miido their way down thej-'onyon to a
farm where they spent the night.
This morning ropes were attached to
the suitcases in the tonneau of the
Walker machine and they were hauled
up to tho road. To haul up the auto
mobile will be a difficult feat.
Walker is a son of D. F. Walkor, for
mer president of the Calitorniu tSnfo De
posit and Trust company of Hun Fran
cisco. Mrs. Walker is a daughter of
John F. Given, of Kan Francisco. After
his marriage four years ago Walker
gave up aviation because his wife
thought it too dangerous.
staff headquarters ami receives (ten

report is finished and the emperor's or
ders for generals along the entire front
aro sent out by telegruph from au ad
joining room.
Tho czar eats lunch lit his own quar
ters. A taste of horse d 'oeuvres, an
omlotte, a men, desert and coffee from
his usuul meul ut this time of day, with
a cigarette after the coffee. He does not
smoke cigars. At lunch are the crown
prince, two aides, the governor of the
pahu-e, a court functionary, the imperial
physician and usually a few guests, vis
iting allied generals. Russian generals
at headquarters for the duy, a minister
from Petrogrud perhaps and rarely (ieu
erul Alexieff. This busy man does not
feel he can spare an hour aud a half a
day over lunch.
About 3 o'clock the czar motors to
the country with the crown prince, the
crown prince's dog and usually two
youngsters, pals of the future emperor
of Russia, chosen by himself from
among the ordinary boys living neur
headquarters.
Walks Five Miles Daily.
Once the town is left behind the em
peror gets out mid walks, doing about
five miles at a brisk pace. Some times
he gets ilito on ordinury rowboat and
pulls the oars himself. As Derevenco,
a giant sailor friend of the heir to the
throne, is not infrequently a member of
the party, it sometimes happens that
an ordinary jack tar has the experience
of being rowed by the czar. Spading
sand along the river bank is another
form of exercise sometimes enjoyed ny
the emperor, -v
Six o'clock finds the imperial enm-
