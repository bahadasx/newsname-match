in the Eastern Theater ol War;
Germans Strike Back on Somme
I Berlin, Oct. 3, via London, 5:11 p. m. The war office
I announced today that Austrian and German monitors had
I ; destroyed the pontoon bridges across the Danube in the rear
!of the Rumanian forces which have crossed the river and
invaded Bulgaria.
Berlin, Oct. 3, via London, 5:12 p. m. Official an
1 nouncement was made here today that Austro-German troops

I 1 drawn before superior Rumanian forces.
I Rumania's stroke against the Cen
tral Powers In throwing a force across
the Danubo into Bulgaria Is the out
standing feature In the current war
news.
Should this army prove to be of
formidable size, It will constitute a se
rious menace to Field Marshal von
Mackonsen's loft flank and might eas
ily force his retirement from the
present front, south of the Constanza
Tchernavoda railway. Ho already Is
being subjected to heavy pressure
along this line by tho Russians and
Rumanians, presumably in connec
tion with tho flanking operations.
Tho latest statement from Sofia
minimizes the Importance of the Ru
manian Invasion, mentioning the In
vading force as consisting of "several
battalions," convoyed across tho river
In boats between Rustchuk and Turtu
kai. "Measures have been taken to
attack this force," the official bulle
tin declares.
Tide of Battle Fluctuates.
In Macedonia, as elsewhere in tho
eastern war theatre, the allies are
pressing offensive movements pre
sumably to prevent reinforcements be
ing sent by tho Central Powers from
one Hold of activity to another. The
tide of battle is fluctuating on both
wings.
The Serbians appear to have gained
tho upper hand in the hilly Kalmak
calan region. Sofia admits a Bulgar
ian retirement there and the French
official report announces a new ad
vance by the Serbians, who have
captured first lino trenches and tak
en another Bulgarian batten.
Bulgarians Are Repulsed.
"F.ntnnfA statements declare the Bul-
II garlans were repulsed In the eastern
I end of tho Macedonian front and in
I attacks upon British positions east of
I tho Struma. Sofia, however, reports
I tho capture by Bulgarian forces of
I the villages of Jonikol and Novolyen,
I which tho British had been taken.
I On the Sommo front a period ol
I counter attacks by tho Germans ap
I pears to have set In. They have been'
I , striking back strongly at the British
I alpug tho PozIereB-Bapaume road,
I working their way back Into tho vll
I lago of Eaucourt l'Abayc and today
I they are reported by Paris to have
I attempted heavy strokes at tho
I French lines near Rancourt, north ot
Peronne. They were unable, how
I ever, to debouch from tho St. Pierre
I Vaast wood north of Rancourt, Paris
I declares, being checked by the French
I curtain of flro and machino guns.

has ordered the evacuation of tho
Danubo fortresses of Slllstrla and
Turtukal recently captured by tho
'h Teuton Bulgarian and Turkish forces,
?f says a dispatch from Romo to the
Wireless Press.
4 Tho reason given for the withdraw
al ol nf vnn Mackonsen's forces Is that

H crossed the Danubo between Rus-
H ; tchuk and Turtukal.

BRYCE DECRIES
SPIRITJ HATE
Talk of Lasting Trade War
Causes Despair for the
Future.
HOPES FOR U. S. AID
People Should Join in Action
to Remove Terrors of
War.
Birmingham, England, Oct. 3. Vis
count Bryco of Dechmont, former am
bassador at Washington, addressing
the Congregational Union today, de
cried the spirit of hate against the
Germans and the talk of a lasting,
trade war. In conclusion he advocat
ed a league to restrain aggression
and compel arbitration.
"If thero is to be a recurrence of
wars, becoming more terrible with
tho unceasing advance of science," he
said. "We may well despair of the
future.
Lord Bryce recalled that Premier
Asquith, Lord Grey and Mr. Balfour
had expressed energetically and sin
cerely the need of such machinery
and said that several groups of think
ers were working out their plans.
Would Preserve Peace.
"To establish any machinery for
preserving peace," continued Lord
Bryce, "would be impossible without
the co-operation of the neueral states
and especially tho greatest of all the
neutral states. Wo have been wait
ing and watching to see whether
America would, in view of her im
mense interests at stake, depart from
her old policy oLcomplete.isolatIon
and bear her part In the effort for
securing a permanent alliance for
peace. An influential league for that
purpose has already been formed
there and now two momentous events
havo happened, no which I dwell be
cause they have been little noticed
here.
President Wilson's Speech.
"President Wilson delivered four
months ago a powerful and luminous
speech in which ho announced that
tho United States could not stand
aloof from a movement In which the
high interests of mauhood were con
cerned and that he felt sure the peo
ple of tho United States were pre
pared to Join in any feasible scheme
for tho prevention of future wars.
Hughes for Peace.
"Two months ago Mr. Charles E.
Hughes in accepting tho nomination
as candidate for the presidency by
tho Republican party declared with no
less force and no less sincerity that
ho was convinced the time had come
for America to unite with European
countries in a well considered scheme
for applying methods of arbitration
and conciliation to securing general
and permanent peace In the world.
"Thus tho heads of the two great
American parties, distinguished men
and the official exponents of Ameri
can opinion, have promised the co
operation of their nation in this pro
ject one of great difficulty no doubt,
but also of supreme Importance.
People Should Be United.
"Our people and the statesmen who
lead our people could have no greater
encouragement to address themselves,
when the time comes, to this enter
prise which they havo already pro
nounced to be necessary. I ask your
help to bring the matter before the
people and show them how much we,
and every nation, have to gain by re
moving the terror and the danger of
war, which so long has hung like a
black cloud over Europe. Tho
cnurcnes couiq uu uu muio iw
Christian worlc
"Let not this war havo been In
vain.
Search for Feasible Plan.
"Let us search for and try to put
into practice some scheme for reduc
ing and, if possible, at last for ending
this oldest and most terrible scourge
of mankind."
Lord Bryco said his country was
virtually unanimous in holding that
the war must be pursued to victory so
complete as to open the prospect of
an ending peace, and added:
"On tho terms of that treaty the
people will Insist and ought to insist
on expressing their opinion and the
churches must do their part in help
ing to form It."
Churches Should Do Their Part.
Ho declared that tho precepts of
Christianity coincide with those of
political wisdom and that the church
es should work for national unity and
good feeling between the classes.
"If possible, let us repress the spir
it of hate," ho said, "Wo aro justly
Indignant at tho war, the enemy pow
ers havo waged. We trust that our
victory will warn tho world that such
methods must never be resorted to
again and that those guilty of them
will be punished. But, Is It wise to
talk of banning a whole people for
all time to como? Tho German peo
ple ore under a harsh and tyrranous
rule, which has not only deceived
and misled them, but silences any pro
test and there are those who wish to
protest against Its crimes. Some day
we hope they will overthrow it, when
they have learned the truth.
Revenge Sows Seed6 of War.
"To indulge in revenge will bo to
sow the seeds of future wars. Na
tions cannot hato ono another for
ever and tho sooner thoy cease to do
so, the better for all of them. We
must tako all proper steps to defend
ourselves from any dangers that
might arise if, after the war, the ene
my countries were to resume an in
sidious hostility. That is at present
no more than a possibility which may
never arise.
"But tho talk wo now hear about
starting, after peace has been con
cluded, a new war of trade to follow
the war of arms has immense capaci
ties for mischief. Such a trade war
would prolong and embitter afresh
those hatreds that ought to he al
lowed to die, and It assumes a contin
uance of those very things from
which we expect our victory to de
liver us once for all.
Must Secure Durable Peace.
"Our main purpose will have failed
if we do not secure a durable peace.
To prolong hatreds would increase
suspicion, would lead In time to a
recurreiJco of those very calamities
from which we are now suffering.
If severe terms have to be imposed,
let that be done only so far as is
necessary for securing future peace,
not in a vindictive spirit which, in
perpetuating hatreds, would end by
relighting the flames of war.
Lord Bryce advocated that the prin
ciples of nationality be respected as
far as possible especially in the cases
of Poland, the southern Slavs, Tran
sylvania and Armenia.
