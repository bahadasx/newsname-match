Adjourned Session.
"Last year a number of state sena
tors, state officials and other enjoyed
iw.si remarkable trip through Northern
^*^fl|Finnesota, which jaunt was known as
*the "adjourned session." They spent
ten days seeing the wonders and
beauties of this part of the state. It
is stated that one of the scheduled
spofts on that trip was omitted, this
being "Glengarry," the beautiful
summer home of Senator McGarry on
the shores of Leech Lake, near
Walker.
Some of the members of the party
at that time thought "Glengarry" a
sCTVth of the fertile brain of Senator
'"at and were skeptical as to the ex
istence of real Th
Vs
"adjournedasession"Glengarry." has been revivee
-^by Senator McGarry and he now
promises a most pleasant surprise
awaiting them at "Glengarry."
The special train will leave St Paul
tomorrow morning at about nine
o'clock over the Northern Pacific rail
road. The party will be served
lunch at Brainerd.
To Discuss Measures.
That the "adjourned session" will
nave much bearing on the next ses
sion of the state legislature is evi
dent. There will no doubt be dis
cussions by the senators in regard
to various measures which will be
submitted at the next session.
One of the big subjects which may
be discussed on board the special by
the officers is the drainage work in
Minnesota.
Twenty-five million dollars has
"been spent on drainage work in Min
nesota in the last 20 years, nearly
$1,000,000 of it in the form of state
appropriations and yet, in the opin
ion of state officers and experts, the
^-^work has just begun.

officers bu
a entirely basisclaim, Confert
ences already have taken place for
the discussing future plans. Defects
in the present drainage system are
agreed on and are outlined as fol
lows:
Drainage has been attempted in the
past in a wasteful, headless and piece
meal fashion
No comprehensive survey of the
"State has ever been made, and proj
ects have been put through without
any correlation.
Most drainage work has been done
independent of any state control,
through judicial or county ditch pro
ceedings and on surveys made with
reference to any common base
level.
As ditches have multiplied, they
have poured surplus of waters sud
denly into narrow, sluggish water
courses, overflowing lands below and
ruining farmers who have no redress
except through state action.
State appropriations have been
made and expended without adequate
knowledge of projects, and much
work already done will need to be
done over.
State officials burdened with many
*,the duties have been held re
sponsible for administering drainage
j%ork.

ANNEXATION OF
NYMORE IS READ
FOR SECOND TIME
Annexation of Village Nearing Com-
pletion Village Now Without
Government.
STREET GASOLINE PUMPS
ABE ORDERED REMOVED
South of East End of Third Street
Proposed for Armory Building
Site.
The annexation of Nymore to Be
midji is nearing completion. At a
meeting of the city council last eve

annexation of the village to the city
was given its second reading. On its
next reading the ordinance will be
passed, will later be published and
the village will be a part of the city.
Without Government.
Nymore at present is without a gov
ernment. The village government
ceased to exist on Sept. 30. The of
ficers in power up to the first of the
month and officials of the city of Be
midji are, however, taking care of
the affairs of the village and police
and fire protection will be given im
mediately.
The city council at the meeting
last night decided to have all curb
gasoline pumps removed. All per
mits isstfed for such pumps will be
revoked. The pumps can be re
moved under the sidewalk ordinance
and City Engineer Swinson was or
dered to have the pumps removed im

The council appropriated $20 for
the city's membership to the Min
nesota Municipalities League.
Lieut. Earle A. Barker of the Be
midji Naval militia attended the
meeting and discussed the locating
of an armory in Bemidji. It had

at the east end of Fourth street but
on account of the filling necessary it
has been thought best to change the
site. The council last evening dis
cussed south of the east end of Third
street as a proposed site. The matter
was taken under advisement.

GAS TALK AT COUNCIL:
MOBERG TELLS STORY
The city council was dis
cussing the problem of placing
gas pipes under paved streets
and the suggestion was made
that the pipes could be forced
under the streets.
"Why sure, the pipes can
be forced under the streets,"
spoke up Alderman Moberg.
I
And the council sat back
comfortably in their chairs to
hear the tale.
"I had such an experience,"
continued Mr. Moberg. "I
had a garden hose in my front
yard and one day some boys
turned on the water and stuck
the hose, nozzle first, into the
ground. Do you know that
hose went straight down into
the ground the entire length
and I had a hard time finding
it."
No, the meeting was not
adjourned immediately.

BONES OF ANCIENT
PERSON UNEARTHED
NEAR SPOONER MAY
HAVE BEEN GIANT
Skeleton Leads Physicians to Believe
Being Was That of Seven-foot
Tall Woman.
TO BE PRESENTED TO
HISTORICAL SOCIETY
Large Mounds Found in Territory
Pieces of Pottery are
Found.
An enlightening contribution to
historical data concerning the early
mound builders of the Rainy Lake
region has been made in the finding
of a skeleton of a prehistoric being
near Spooner.
The skeleton was found on a caved
in bank of clay off the Rainy river.
It is well preserved and is thought
to be that of a woman. The bones
have been taken to Spooner and
placed on exhibition.
Prehistoric Person.
Physicians who have examined the
skeleton declare that it represented
a type of early prehistoric persons
who were seven feet or more and who
possessed an especially large lower
jaw. They drew this conclusion be
cause the skeleton found was that of
a person of a very large stature. The
jaw bone was wide and its construc
tion is said to be a special gift of na
ture to the early man In order that
he could masticate the coarser foods
which then made up his subsistence.
The skull is very large. The well
rounded forehead gives evidence of
considerable development of intelli
gence among these early inhabitants
of the Rainy Lake territory. The
fact that the skeleton was found at
the base of the mound established the
fact that the being once belonged to
a race of mound people builders, sev
eral persons declare.
Pottery Unearthed.
Some large mounds have been
found in this territory. In some
places a number of pieces of pottery
have been unearthed. It will be re
membered that when the dam at In
ternational Falls was under construc
^ku\stevera hundred pieces of teraper-
e'4 copper were unearthed from a
depth of 15 feet. The articles con
sisted of fish hooks, knives, spears
and arrows. The art of tempering
copper which was known to these
early mound builders is now a lost
art. At the time of the discovery of
these articles it was estimated that
the mound dwellers lived in the
Spooner territory between 1,000 and
1,200 years ago.
The mound at the base of which
the skeleton was found was opened
about three years ago. At that time
several pieces of pottery were found.
There is no question in the minds of
the people in the Spooner district
but what the skeleton unearthed rep
resents intelligent, industrious mound
dwellers who lived before the days
of the red men.
The skeleton will be sent to the
Minnesota Historical society.
