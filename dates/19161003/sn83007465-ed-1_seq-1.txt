Features During Week.
Many Visitors.
Van Wyck, Oct. 3.?-Mayor Jones'
reply to my letter of Sept. 12, gives,
much information and we are glad
he has informed the country people
as to what the town of Lancaster
has been doing for them. The road
building was very much needed a few
years ago, when much of the produce
raised in Lancaster county was marketed
outside of the county a*> better
roads were found going to Waxhaw,
Monroe and other towns. Hut since
the good roads have been made in
Lancaster county leading to Lancaster,
the trade has been turned that
way, so that the town of Lancaster
has been somewhat compensated
for the road taxes Us citizens have
been paying for the rural roads. We
havA no fight to make against Mayor
Jotv/s in using the flood money by
flood sufferers for building good
streets in Lancaster. But as I stated
in my letter on Sept. 12, that I knew
of no other place the flood funds
were being used in Lancaster county,
only on the streets of Lancaster. 1
thought this was a great injustice to
many of the flood sufferers in Lancaster
county and did not think it
right; that all the flood funds of
Lancaster county should be used on
the streets of the town-of Lancaster,
and requested that an investigation
be made for the purpose of making a
more equitable distribution.
It is impracticable for many of the
flood suiferers to leave their homes
and work on the streets of Lancaster,
and work should be more conveniently
arranged for them. The mayor
of Lancaster has nothing to do with
this, but the supervisor of the county
shoud look after tfiis, and I think
this was the intention of the plan of
the distribution of these funds,
when the supervisors of each county
was named on the committee of distribution,
as it would be very natura'
i i i i
mitt, m- m iiit ill III' iiesi poMcit US I(.
where the work could be placed t<>
the greatest convenience of the flood
sufferers. Tnis has been done ii,
many counties, and it should be done
1n Lancaster county.
We notice the call for a convention
of the Reform Progressive Party foi
the State of South Carolina. Van
Wyck will not nave a representative
in that convention, as far as we
know. If we have any kickers
around here they have not made
themselves known.
Mr. W. 11. Hyatt of Kershaw bar
brought his teams to Van Wyck and
assisting his tat tier, Mr. J. A.
Lyatt, in building roads.
Miss Kathleen Hailcs entertained
Van Wyck Christian Kndeavors at
her home last Wednesday afternoon
and gave them a pleasant time.
Mrs. C. S. Massey and Mrs. H. C.
Houston of Waxhaw visited Mr. R.
11. Massey's tamily last Thursday.
They made the trip in Mrs. Houston's
Ford.
The ice cream and box supper at
Van Wyck school house last Friday
night was an enjoyable occasion.
It was well attended by the young
people and a few older ones, all ol
whom seemed to be in the very her*
of hunior and everything passed o!f
very pleasantly. A nice little sum
was turned over to the financial committee
for Van Wyck Methodist
church.

Dates?Mgr. M
At a meeting of the managing
cwiiiuiiiiuc ui lii?* L#aiicasier i.ouniy
Fair Association held last evening,
much work was perfected in the interest
of the coming event, the exact
dates being November 20-25,
1916. From present indications and
reports coming in from all parts of
the county, the proposed undertaking
will, in all probability, materialize
into a much greater event than
was at first anticipated by those behind
the movement.
The association regretted very
much the loss of Mr. J. H. l'oag, assistant
cashier Hank of Lancaster,
as secretary and treasurer, but on
account of certain pressing business
matters he could not undertake the
ardous duties in connection with thej
office; hence, Mr. Max (J. Hrittain of
the Farmers Hank & Trust Company
was prevailed upon to accept the office.
Max, as he is known by a
large circle of admiring friends, is a
hustling young business man. possessed
of an abundant supply of push
and energy, and is much interested
in work of this nature, therefore, a
hotter selection for the office of secretary
and treasurer could not have
been made.
Hy some unknown reason The
News in its last issue omitted the
name of .Mr. ('. L. McMnnus, Lancaster
county's efficient Farm Demonstrator.
from the list of those
who constitutes the premium and
exhibit committee. Mr. McManus is
a valuable worker, and has always
taken a great interest in our Fair
Association work, lie is a valuable
man on this particular committee.
Among the additional committees |
appointed were:
Display and Decoration.
Mrs. J. It. Markorell, chairman.
Mrs. \V. II. Millen.
Mrs. Millen Plyler.
Mrs. Mary Harron.

as submitted to all Southern mem
ers of congress the suggestion that

f the replies from senators and repensatives
favor the plan and Mr.

ut the details.
Many members of congress havo
xpressed their willingness to give

mtong the numerous communicaions
received by President Pope was

saying: "I can not see for a

1 am already giving this

ope that at an early date something
fTeotive and reasonable may be.
orked out along tne line of your

President Pope states t''s?. I tloro
hould le a careful distinction ho'
""it tlte loan minimum and tie
filing minimum of cotton. "The
>an minimum should he protected

ntton would of course never he sold

is one that the union advises
