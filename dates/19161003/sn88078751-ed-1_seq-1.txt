Roumanian Losces Sustained In

London, Oct. 2. This city and the
east coast of England wa3 again raid
ed by a Meet of German airships. The
official statement says a number of
bombs were dropped, but that the
damage was slight.. Aa airship is re
ported to have been brought down
north of London.
Pour Zeppelin raids on London and
the east coast have been carried out
in tho !ast month, the more recent at
tacks being made by airships of tho
newer and bigger typo. On Sept. 2
ono Zeppelin was struck while flying
over the London district and fell in
I flames. Two Zcprelins were destroy-
I ed in the raid bn Sept. 23.
J Still further gains for the British
and French troops north of the Som-
; me river in France are chronicled In
the latest official communications
from the war office at Paris. The
, Germans have been cleared out of po-
I sitlons near the Stuff redoubt whlcn
they had hold since the heavy light-
k ing ot last week, and also have been
forced to give up all except a very
Bmall portior of the Schwaben re
doubt In this region. In addition, to
the east, between Lesars and Flers.
the troops of General Sir Douglas -Haig
have pushed forward their posi
tions. German trenches near Morval
and Clory fell into the hand3 of the
French In grenade fighting.
Berlin reports, however, that at
tacks by the British east of Thiepval
and by the French in the vicinity of
Rancourt, Cource'ctte, Morval and
Halle were repulsed.
In Galicia the Russians have started
another big offensive, with the pur
pose of driving on to Lemberg. Ber
llne asserts that the Russian forces
along the Brody-Lemberg railway
were stopped by the artillery of the
Teutons. But on the southern wing
Berlin admits the Russians gained a
foothold and also advanced in the
angle between the Tsenluvka and Zlo
ta Llpa rivers.
In the Camathlans, in the Ludowa
section, the Austrlans have turned to
the offensive and. according to Vien
na. In an attack captured four Russian
officers and 432 men and eight ma
chine guns.
The Roumanian theater is witness
ing only local oneagements. The dum
ber of prisoners taken by the armv of
General Von Falkenhayn In the Her
mannstadt region exceeded 3,000.
Thirteen puns and lame quantities of
supplfes a'so were cantured, including
300 railroad cars laden with muni
tions. LIVE STOCK AND GRAIN
