PEflJ an tnnlo quartet sang two Selections.
B Chairman Allen Introduced T. U.
B Hoyt, congressional nomlnco on the

flf "i wish to bring to tho people of
BH Logan the nssuranco that at least
AH 11 counties of the stato will give
flflj substantial majorities to tho Repub
IB llcan party in tho coming Nlvombor
JIB election. This Is tho most momen
flflj tous campaign in my recollection,
B and tho substantial people of tho
flflj stato want to know tho Issues. I
flflj endorso to the letter both the stato
JB and national platform. Thoy aro ro
HBj sponslvo to the highest spirit of Am
HH crlcanlsm. Tho prosent Democratic

B They wcro placed in power by a voto
B f on'' 42 per cent of tho total vote
B of tho nation. Thus ono may sco
BB that tho majority of tho peopio of

H tho history of tho country will show

B After a selection by tho quartet

BB Houso would bo Republican, but tho
BB senato was not so certain urging tho

IB ato, Hon, tleorgo Sutherland ono
BB of tho leading legal minds of tho sen
BB ato. And in tho same breath charac
BB terlzed Reed Smoot ns ono of tho
BE leading statesmen of tho nation. I
H have discovered a deep seated un
BH rest In the nation and tho Democratic
H administration Is ovoroly criticised.
H In spite of their published list of
BH progressive and beneficent legislation
Bb that they claimed to liavo enacted
8 slnco going Into power. Lot us sco
BJ how well foundod somo of those
H claims are, They claimed to have
HE passed a child labor law, but tho
BJ Child Labor Dureap appointed to In
H vestlgato tho child labor problem was
BE appointed by Republican Congress
flfl and after an investigation covering
BE years mado their report tptho pros
BE cnt administration, with 'the result
BE that a child labor law was passed In
BE tho twinkling of an oyo, and tho law
fl as passed has no mora effect In ab
9 ollshlng child labor than though It
B wb not pit on tho statuto books bo
f causo of tho Joker in tho samo that
BE nullifies Its offoct.
BE This legislation as was tho eight
BE our bill recently passed, woro pass-
ed for political reasons. Whon Pros-
Went Wilson surrondurod to tho de
BE mands of tho four brotherhoods of
BE railway tralnmon and passed tho
H eight hour law tho most vicious legls
BE latlvo action in tho history of Amorl-
ca.took place, if those brother hoods
cun co-orcq, tho president and Unit-
ic-l States Congress why not others.
J This Is tho mest dangerous precedont
ever established in tho halls or Con-
Brcss. It Is not a law to create an
BJ '
eight hour labor period, buMfn arbi
trary lncroaso of 23 per cent in tho
wages paid this class of labor. It
consequently necessitates nn increas
ed cost to tho railroads of tho coun
try of millions of dollars and you will
pay the peopio will pay this Increased
cost through Increased freight nnd
passenger rates something that wo
liavo spent years in trying to reduce.
Tho Democratic party boasts of
prosperity. is this prosperity do to
Democratic" rulo recalled twenty years
ago when tho Industry of tlfo country
were prostrated and even as lato as
October 1913, nftor tho Underwood
law went into effect the same condi
tion began. Then camo this great
war, that had built up a tariff wall
higher and stronger tlmnany ever
known before, bocauso tho U. S. Is
the producing nation of tho world and
nil Europo tho consumers. South Am
erica enjoys tho Bamo prosperity from
tho same causo. A serious economic
problem will confront us at tho closo
of tho wnr, and tho conditions will
bo rovcrsed, and protection Is neces
sary or our very Industrial llfo will
bo Jeopardized. Tho Democrats claim
Wilson has kept us out of war. Thank
God for Wilson.
I say to you folks now, that we
havo been kept out of war not be
cause of Wilson, but in spito of him.
Aro wo at war with Mexico. I say
yes. But an Inglorious war. A"do
Bplcablo war. When tho Republic
ans turned over tho affairs of govern
ment to President Wilson there had
been years of Internal troublo and
Insurrection in Mexico, but no lives
had been lost, no property destroy
ed. This good old American ilag was
respected thcro. It stood for Justice,
and liberty. The Tainptco Incident
known to nil was nn act of war, In
which nineteen of our boys lost their
lives. Tho atrocities to American
property owners tho massacre of our
citizens on peaceful missions bent,
until somo 500 havo lost their lives,
would seem to mo to bo nothing
short of war. Our army was ordered
Into Mexico after tho Columbus
raid to get Villa dead or alive. What
was tho result? Our army ordered
back-homo whon Carrntiza said we
could go no iairlhor. Tho cost t
theso Mexican wars hnvo been, over
$165,000,000 and now tho solution
of the Mexican troublo is sought by
arbitration.
What is thoro to arbitrate? " Tho
lives that havo been lost. Tho prop
erty dostroyed, and all of this duo
to tho vaccllatlng policy of the Dem
ocratic administration. Give mo tho
Btamlna shown by Orover Cleveland
whon ho said to Great rDitaln, If you
send n fleot tri'Venozuola I will con
sider it an act of hostility, or by The
odoro Roosevelt under similar cir
cumstance Tho world then know
what we meant and respected us in
our rights.
Liberty tho priceless gift of civil
ization waB enjoyed by tho American
citizen In nny part of tho world, but
tho sldo stepping policy of the prcs
ont administration is humiliating to
every patriotic citizen of America.
And as a result n now dance has come
Into popularity over tho country. It
is called tho Wilson slide. You take
ono step forward, two Bteps back
ward, hesitate, salute, then sldo step.
Wo havo now been sldo stepping for
threo years. Oh, to have back our
place In tho sun, undor tho moon nnd
tho stars, and this glorious old flag.
Tho quartet sang tho Star Spnnglod
.Banner, and tho meeting was adjourned.

THE NEW YORK
WORLD ESTIMATE
OF MR. HUGHES
-
Tho Republican Publicity Associa
tion, through Us President, iHon. Jona
than Bourne, Jr., has given out the
following stntement at Its Washington
Headquarters;
"Probably tho most ardent support
er of Woodrow Wilson nnd tho most
hitter opponent of Hughes is tho
New York World, tho leader of tho
Democratic press. In view of Its pre
sent criticism of Mr. Hughes, for
purely partisan reasons, overy Amer
ican voter, of whatovor party, should
read that paper's cstlmato of Hughes
and his work In the past. Tho follow
ing aro excerpts from tho columns of
that p apor during tho period of its
ownorshlp nnd control by the Into
Mr. Pulitzer, who requested In His
will that Mr. Hughes servo ns a
trusteo of his estate, a position
which Mr. Hughes declined:
"September 18 1905 'HUGHES' AD
MIRABLE WORK'. 'His admirable
work ns Counsel for tho Gns Investi
gating Commltteo Justified tho peopio
In accepting from him equally merit
orious sorvlco ns Counsel for the In
surance Investigating Commltteo. Tho
public has not been disappointed In
Mr. Hughes. Ho has Justified overy
expectation. Tho World doubts If
any legislative Investigation In tho
history of tho Stnto was ever conduct
ed with moro ability or moro ration
ally. .It is evident that Mr. Hughes
Is going to the very bottom of In
surance corruption, nnd that when
he h as finished, tho policy holders
and the peopio will know for tho first
tlmo how these great corporations
aro managed.'

struggling so bravely to bear up un
der this trial.

Dr. George Thomas
Dr. Georgo Thomas representing
tho Utah Agricultural Collego, spoko
In behalf of the college and express
ed tho sonow that Levi's instructor
felt' In his untimely demise, stating
that tho only balm for tho deeply
wounded souls of this family can
como through tho dlvlno spirit of
God. Ho read tho 23rd nnd other
Psalms as tho words of God, to com
fort In ninilctlon. Ho gave tho bo
roaved family tho assurance that the
Lord Is tho truo Shepherd of MI, and
gavo as an argument for future llfo
and immortality the facts shown us
In vegetation, whereby nftor a sleep
of thousands of -years Bceds will ger-
ralnato and grow again. Levi RIter
was 'a young man of splendid charac
ter ;and Intellect, a rare disposition,
ono.Jpvcd by all who knew him and
one "whom it was always a pleasure
to como lu contact.wlth. Ho. accom
plished as much in 19 short years as
ho bclloved possible for any mortal
to accomplish. 'Ho pdayed that tho
spirit of God to comfort Sister RIter
nnd Blnk into her heart to assuage
her grief.
A boIo, Sometime Weill Understand
was very beautifully rendered by

Lewis S. Cardon
Lewis S. Cardon, a llfo long neigh
bor of tho RIter family, spoko as fol
lows: Tho Dowers beforo us attest
lu n small way the love In which Le
vi Rltcr-was Jield. I hnvo known him
nil his life, was at his deathbed, and
havo observed as all others, tho man
ly qualities and sterling honesty of
this young man. All tho children of
our neighborhood loved him. Ho
was as clean In llfo, in thought and
In deed ns any young man I have
ever known. Tho boy was always
consldcrato of his mother, thought
first nnd last f her. Our sorrow is
not for him but for thoso deprived
of his companionship. Death Is a part
of llfo. His doward Is suro. We
shall meet and know him If wo aro
worthy to go whero ho has gono.
Mr. Klrkham, of tho U. A. C.
sang O, My Father, very Impressively.
Seymour B. Young
President Seymour B. Young said
lu part; I esteem It an honor to of
fer a few remarks on this occasion.
I appreciate theso beautiful tributes
paid this young rolatlvo of mlno. I
havo known tho family all their llfo.
I knew Levi nnd Waldo who Is n
member of Troop II of the National
Guard of Utah. This was a sad
homo coming for him, but ho had a
right to bo thoro, His fathor was n
soldier in tho Civil War and a brav
er ono novor lived. So Waldo comes
rom the kind of stock who win fako
up arms in tho cause of their coun
try. I never knew a bettor or a wis
er mother thau my sister Allco. Left
with tho responsibility of raising
these boys, Levi and Waldo, aro sam
ples of with .what success sho has
carried out that responsibility. Wo
placo theso mortal remains In the
tomb, but tho spirit 1ms gono to God
who gavo it. Ho probably has met
and embraced his father by this
time. Now, I wish to congratulate
Sister Alice. Sho has not lived In
vain. God has overruled this Incident
for good ns ho docs all things, and
ho hides a smiling faco for you Sis
tor Allco Rltor, und may the Joy and
comfort of God como to you and all
the boys and all present Is my pray
er, Amon,
A duet, Sometime Somowhero, was
rendered In a touching manner by
Misses Glndys Sorcnsen and Elln
Illnnchnrd, of tho Third ward.
John Quayle
Brother John Qunylc of tho Third
ward bishopric, under intense feeling
told of tho ncthitles of Lovl In tho
ward in their priesthood quorums,
and ho said, I do not understand why
so useful nn oxemplnry a young man
has to bo taken from us. Ho hns
gono as n bright start to bo n bea
ccn light to those left behind. I
lovo thoso hoys nnd pray tho bless
i"gs of God to rest on Sister RIter
and tho brothers, and their uncle, 11.
F. RIter, who has been ns n fathor
to them and has done so much good.
Serge F. Dalllf
President s. F. Unlllf made n few
remarks, testifying to all of tho good
things said of Levi Rltor and tho
family. Ho nlso boro n strong testi
mony to tho truthfulness of tho res
urrection nnd cited this boy's life ns
worthy of emulation.
