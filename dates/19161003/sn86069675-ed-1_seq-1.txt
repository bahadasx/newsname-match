NEW LIGHTS ARE
SATISFACTORY
Kentucky Utilities Company In
stall New Street Lights on
North Maysville.
The Kentucky Utilities Company
several days ngo installed new
street lights on Maysville street
from High street to tho residence
of Mr. II. Q. Hoffman, replacing
the- old arc lights that linvo been in
use for many years nnd which were
not giving tho service tho City
The new light is one of the Intcst
street lights of tho character now
on tho market and can be installed
over the entire city and will not on
ly prove more Satisfactory, but will
result in a material saving to the
city on nccount of the nmount of
current used. For some time tho
Council has had the matter under
consideration and may decide to
submit the matter to the people ns
to whether or not we shall have a
municipally owned light plant. The
Council employed nn expert nnd
has tho data ready. Tho Utilities
Company had representatives here
last week to confer with those in
charge of the matter nnd were re
quested to submit a bid to the city
for furnishing the lights for the en
tire city similnr to those on North
Maysville street. The present
Council secured a reduction in the
contract made Inst February nnd
which expires next February of
several hundred dollars but are of
the opinidrithat there should be n
yet further material reduction made
in this item of city expense.
The Council is giving careful
thought toQmfmatter and we know
of no city in the State that has a
more conscientious, able set of of-
i
flcials than ours.
