TOKIO, Japan, Oct, 3. The .cabi

today. "
By United Press. (
WASHINGTON, Oct 3. The resig
nation of Count Okuma had been rum
ored for a long time. It was' stated at
the Japanese embassy today. No offi
cial word, however, has been received
that the resignation had been tend
ered. '
It is the belief here that Okuma's
resignation resulted from the fact that
he had ceased to have a controlling
voice lnthe affairs of the Japanese
government The cabinet which he
headed was a coalition cabinet and
he did not have a majority of sup
porters in it

Athletic Department " Joins
rLocal1 Merchants utp Bring
4f More People Here.
C. L. Brewer, director- of ath
letics, announced today " that the
University Athletic Department will
co-operate -.ith the leading merchants
of Columbia in making Trade Week
successful. The department will re
fund Its proportion of railroad fares
to all persons from Columbia's trade
territory who attend the Washington
Tiger football game, October 14.
Prof. Berwer said this morning he
thought the Co-operative Trade Week
a good Idea and desired to aaa tne
Athletic Department of the University
to the list of Columbia Institutions that
arejstriving to bring more "people to
Columbia.
By all means put us In the list,"
Mr. Brewer said.
- There are about 50,000 people living
In thejtrade territory of Columbia out-slde-ofvthe
city limits. (If only three-
f fourths of these persons 'came-to C&;
lumbia regularly to'db their shopping,
it woula niake'Columbd'a larger city,
and" would lower price averages with
stores carryin'larger stocks. If Co
lumbia ha)3 i5,000 population r -with
many varied Industries, It would' in
crease the "value of every farm 'in
Boone County 'bringing Inter-urban
lines." ' t J '
These are the vital reasons of the
Co-operative Trade Week planned by
the- leading tojres of-Columbia' tor
next week. .They are the Treasons
that prompt the merchantg.Qf Kansas
City to hold their annual Stylo Show;
