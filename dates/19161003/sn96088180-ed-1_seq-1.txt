HANLY RANDS HOT
ONE TO MARSHALL
Kansas City. Oct. 3. Prohlblilon-
lata here today' were wondering If
Vice-President Marshall would an
swer the "tanning" handed him Inst
night &y J. Frank Hanly, their pre
sidential nomlnoe, when ho charac
terised President Wilson's running
mate as a "national calamity."
I The dry leader also charged Presl
j dent , Wilson and Governor Hughes
were sfrald to fsce the prohibition
i Issue, and rapped Taft and Fairbanks
I for their attitude on these questions.
L But he saved his warmest lashing
for Marshall, declaring:
"He Is the nattonal calamity In
that, should Wilson-be re-elected and
by Providential Interference be taken
from executive power, Marshall, who
has done more buslneus on less capi
tal than any man I ever knew, would
become president. Marshall made
an abject surrender to the liquor traf
fic. And I found that he had confess
ed It In a message which he wrote
and addressed to the Indiana legis
lature, asking that the dry law In
effect In that state be repealed be
cause he, as governor, could not en
force It."

Embezzlement of Ikzzj

a sonW. A. Newell, for 11 years de-
mnnAV fpAtn ItlA mnna afa tniA
and today Is under arrest charged
by a post office Inspector with era
beszlement nere investigating the condition of
certain of the post office funds. Aft.
a result or the Investigation Mr. Gal
lagher last night made complaint be
fore United States Commissioner Her
bert Smith, charging Newell with em-
bexslement. The complaint alleges
that the taking of cash from the
money order fund by Mr. Newell has
covered period between June 30,
1118, snd September 30, 116. The
complslnt does not set out the amount
of the embexslement, but the amount
Is understood to be abont 3520. '
Arrested upon a warrant Issued by
Commissioner Smith, Mr. Newell was
arraignea oerore tne commissioner
this forenoon. He waived, prelimin
ary examination, and bonds were,
plsced at 33,000. Because of diffi
culty In obtaining bondsmen, the
amount was later reduced to 31,300,
and Mr. Newell Is now attempting to
raise this.
Mr. Newell makes no denial "of the
serious charge that has been Disced
against him. He admits tbst he 'first
took cash from1 the fnnd more than
three years ago at the time of ths
last Illness of his son. At that time,
he says, he took 200, expecting to
replace It later through the sale of
his home. He at later dates took
amounts from 325 to 350 at a time,
but occasionally replaced small
amounts of the stolen cash. The
3520, he says,; Is all the shortage
there la In fhe office. Inspector Gal
lagher Is still working upon the ac
counts of the office, and declined to
state the amount of the shortage. .
How he kept the amount of hla
shortage covered for more thsn three
years was explained to the Courier
by Mr. Newell this afternoon. He
said that he at all times made a cor-
ifib ic,in ui iuv acinus o uv de
partment. A falsified report was kept .
In the office, however, and this bal
anced with the cash In the money
order fund., For more than three
years the Inspectors have been fooled
by this false report, the uncovering
coming at last, It to said, when offl-
olals wired to the department to find
how much of a balance the report of
the local office showed In the money
order fund upon certain date. Whei
a discrepancy was found In the re
port at Washington and the report
made here, Inspectors at once started
the Investigation, which resulted la
the unearthing of the true condition.
During all of these three and one
half years Mr. Newell has kept ac
count of the amount he owed Uncle
Sam, and confidently expected, be
says, to make repayment. Bach
monthly and quarterly report has
been made to jibe with his juggled
figures, and only recently had the fin
ger of suspicion turned toward him.
He tells a story of worry over finances
that 'must turn sympathy to him. He
had mortgaged hs home and had
even borrowed every possible dollar
upon his life Insurance poHoles to
send his stricken son to Colorado In
the hope of finding health and
