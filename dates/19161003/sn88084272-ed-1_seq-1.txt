port issued yesterday by the depart
ment of commerce and labor. Mr. Pope's
statement says:
"Every Indication now points to a
billion dollar cotton crop, if properly
marketed. The greatest aggregate
amount received for any crop hereto
fore was in 191S. which brought the
farmers nearly nine hundred million
dollars.
Ginning 00.000 Bale Dally.
"We are now ginning over 269.06
bales per day. At this rate the present
crop will practically be out of the field
by October SOth. If the farmer will
market the remainder of the crop slow
ly it will sell for 20 cents. Now that
the present crap Is well on its way to
the market and the public mind Is
fixed upon fair prices the cotton farm
ers stould adopt measures to protect
future crops against the disaster of
low prices.
"The farmers union will ask the next
session of congress to authorize the
federal reserve board to fix a minimum
loan price of 12 cents per pound on
cotton which will insure a selling price
of from 15 to 26 cents."

TAXES RUINOUS
Mining Companies Operat

fore Commissioners.
Atlantic City. N. jj Oct I. A pro
test against what were characterized'
as confiscatory decrees issued in Mex
ico, was lodged with the American
Mexican jokit commission here Mon
day by a committee representing 50
mining and smelting companies. The
conference was continued today and
the system of taxation under the Car
ranza administration was discussed
further. -
William Loeb. jr., representing the
American Smelting and Refining com
pany, headed the delegation. The oth
er members were: Perry Bruere,
American Metals company: D. J. Haff,
' ftr.aiif.r.n.ii.a ronnAr jtmnanv
Charles Early. United Smelters, and
Julian W. Beatty. American Metals
company. It was the first time that
witnesses have appeared before either
the American or Mexican commission
ers. Show Decrease In Production.
In the mass of statistics submitted
Monday was a statement showing the
decrease in the output of metal since
1912. Acording to these figures the
output In 1912 was: Silver. 33,609.606
ounces: gold. 243.666 ounces; coper,
74.601) tons: zine. 46.666 tons, and lead.
6S.666 tons.
The figures for the first six months
of 191S were given as: Silver. 6.060,
000 ounces; gold. 380,000 ounces: cop
per. 23.060 tons; zinc. 11.000 tons, and
lead. 3006 tons.
Many nave Forfeited Property.
They told the American commission
ers that the export taxes on gold and
silver had been Increased to four times
what they were In 1912. and that now
a heavy tax was Blaced on lead. Conner
and zinc where none had been imposed.
iney aiso placed Detore, the commis
sioners a statement showing heavy In
creases in other taxes affecting the
industry and characterized them as
confiscatory since the low grades of
a great quantity of the ores produced
made Impracticable the operation of
mines under such conditions. Many
lorieitures aireaav nave been forced,
according to the committee.
etual Investment Is 8215,000,000,
The actual investment of the com
panies represented was placed at
S215.000.0OO. The American commis
sioners were assured that the mining
operators are prepared to make the
government contributions which are
"not in the nature of arbitrary exac
tions and which do not Involve the
practical confiscation of property and
make impossible the operation of their
enterprises on a business basis."
Secretary of the interior Lane made
public the memorandum presented by
the mining men. They came here at
the request of the American commis
sioners who wanted their statement
of conditions because of the mass of
contradictory evidence.

earlier in the day was marked by the
presentation by the Mexicans of a
plan of border patrols which Included

forces.
The Mexicans assured the American

out the promises they were prepared
to make and that in the future the
military forces of Mexico would ade
qcately safeguard the border. The de
tails of the plan were not disclosed.
