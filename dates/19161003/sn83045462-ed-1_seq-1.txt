Berlin Admits the Rumanians Have
Gained Ground on Both Sides
of the Great Kukel
River.
BERLIN, October 3, via
London, 5:11 p.m.?The war
office announced today that
Austrian and German monitors
had destroyed the pontoon
bridge across the Danube
in the rear of the Rumanian
forces which have
crossed the river and invaded
Bulgaria.

Field Marshal von Mackensen,
who commands the forces of the
central allies operating against
the Rumanians and Russians in
the province of Dobrudja, has
ordered the evacuation of the
Danube fortresses of Silistria and
Turtukai, recently captured by
the Teuton, Bulgarian and Turkish
forces, says a dispatch from
Rome to the Wireless Press.
His Left Flank in Peril.
The reason given tor the withdrawal
V4 ?vu a ?p VUB
German commander is in danger of being
enveloped by the Russian and
Rumanian troops which have crossed
the Danube* between Rustchuk and
Tiirtukai.
Rumania's stroke against the central
powers in throwing a force across
the Danube into Bulgaria is the outstanding
feature in the current war
news.
Should this army prove to be of formidable
slse it will constitute a serious
menace to Von Mackensen's left
flank and might easily force his retirement
from the present front south of
the Constanxa-Tchernavoda railway.
He already is being subjected to heavy
pressure along this line by the Russians
and Rumanians, presumably in
connection with the flanking operation.
Size of Force Unknown.
The latest statement from Sofia minimises
the importance of the Rumanian
invasion, mentioning the invading
force as consisting of "several battalions"
conveyed across the river in
boats between Rustchuk and Turtukai.
"Measures have been taken to attack
this force," the official bulletin declares.
The London newspapers hail the maneuvers
as a dramatic counter stroke
against the Bulgarians for the defeat
the Rumanians suffered at Hermannstadt.
The Times says it hopes Riynanias
did not cross with small forces, "because
the river is wide and the southern
bank higher than the northern, so
that all disadvantages of positions are
against the Rumanians. In any case
the crossing threatens the rear of Field
Mgrsh&l von Mackensen's force in
Dohrudja."

LONDON, October 3.?On the

counter attacks by the
Germans appears to have set in.
They have been striking back
strong at the British along the
Pozieres-Bapaume road, working
their way back into the village of
Eaucourt L'Abbaye, and today
they are reported by Paris to have ;
attempted heavy strokes at the
French lines near Rancourt north .
of Peronne. They were unable,
however, to debouch from the
St. Pierre-Vaast wood northeast
of Rancourt, Paris declares, being ]
checked by the French curtain of
fire and machine guns.

guns, however, were effective in checking
German attempts to debouch from 5
the St. Pierre Vaast wood in this re- ]
Klon.

i
"North of the Somme there was a !
rather violent artillery duel. In the
region north of Rancourt the Germans ;

ALDERMEN ALLOW USE
OF STRIKEBREAKERS
\
Westchester County, N. Paves
Way to Resumption of Street
Car Traffic.
NEW YORK, October 3.?The board
of aldermen of Mount Vernon today
paved the way for the resumption of
street railway traffic in Westchester
county cities, included in the.local car
strike, by amending the ordinance
which prohibited the traction company,
a subsidiary of the 3d avenue system,
from employing strikebreakers.
Similar ordinances have prevented
the free operation of cars in the cities
of Yonkers and New Rochelle. It is
understood that the board of aldermen
of these municipalities will follow the
example set by Mount Vernon.
Violence again broke out here simultaneously
with the police department
announcement that policemen had been
removed from the subway.
Danger of Violence Subsides.
Satisfied that there is little dang-er of
violence in the subway as a result of
the street railway strike, the police
department today withdrew all policemen
from strike duty on the, underground
trains. Since the strike began
a policeman has ridden as guard in the
first car of virtually every train. The
policemen, however, will be kept on
station platforms for a few days longer.
Similar action, it is announced, will
be taken with regard to the elevated
trains as soon as the police have routed
the small bands of strikers and sympathiser's
who have bombarded the trains
from the roof tops in the early morning
hours.
Only one policeman, instead of two,
hereafter will be assigned to each surface
car. Emergency stations established
for mounted policemen wthen the
general sympathetic strike was expected
to materialize have been
abondoned. \
Strike Failure Tacitly Admitted.
Tacit admission of the failure of the
"general" sympathetic strike^ in New
York in behalf of the striking street
car men was made in a report late yesterday
' to a conference of labor leaders,
which discussed the general situation. The
leaders recommended that every union
member of the city be assessed $1 for
the benefit of the subway, elevated and
surface car employes who are on strike
in Manhattan, the Bronx and parts of
Westchester county.
No decision as to further efforts to
call out all unionists in sympathy with
the strikers was taken and there was
no formal admission that the strike plan
had collapsed.
More than 100,000 members of the
United Hebrew Trades returned to work
after their three-day holiday, as did
S,100 brewery workers.

in a corner of the Philadelphia navy
yard where they will live under a
guard of United States marines until
the close of the war.
When the two vessels were convoyed-here
from Norfolk a tract of about
nine acres was set aside for the sailors
along the back channel, where their
ships are -anchored. A small church,
a windmill and farm buildings are
being erected and the 744 men who
were attached to the two vessels will
organise a community patterned after
a small town in Germany. They will
raise vegetables in season and another
tract has been laid out as an athletic
field for their use.

GUARD TROOP
TRAIN, BRISTOL, Tenn., October
3?The mounted organizations
of the District of Columbia National
Guard?Troop A of Cavalry
and Battery A of Field Artillery,
which left Washington late
yesterday afternoon for the border?were
delayed here for one
hour by the wreck of another train
on the main line, and from here
the District troop train of seventeen
cars will be detoured by
Bluff City.
The boys thoroughly enjoyed their enforced
delay, as a large number of pretty
girls turned out to show them that their
seal In the nation's defense Is appreciated
by the "female Of the specie." All along
the line there Have beerf groups of attractive
young women ready to shake
hands and. pass an occasional box of
candy through the car windows. This
perked the boys up. a great deal, for
some of them Were inclined to be lonesome
a bit after they had waved farewell
from the train as It pulled out of Roaslyn
In the dusk last evening. Many of the
boys In the troop and the battery have
promised to write and send pictures
"Just as soon as they Teach camp on the
border."
Every man aboard this train is In flrstclass
condition. That la the official statement
made by Capt. Herbert J. Bryson
of the'Medlcal Corps this morning, after
he had made his insDectlon of the entire
outfit, assisted by his detail from the
sanitary company of the 3d Infantry.
BecoVering From "Overfeeding/'
The men are recovering from' o^rfefcfeeding
last night, when, in addition to ^
heacty meal- prepared .by the cookjr of
their own unit, they gormandised everything,
from preserved cherries to hard
boiled eggs. These goodies were contained
in more than 300 boxes that were
handed in through the windows by relatives
,3-nd friends after the troops had
entrained.
The District trpops reached Bristol at 9
o'clock this morning on schedule time,
without having made any extended stop
at the stations along the way.
The spirits of the men are high, and
they are enthusiastic for real border
experience. They have had plenty of |
roqm in the coaches and all enjoyed a
fine sleep last night. The mattresses
and pillows were especially welcome
after the cots on which they have been
sleeping for the last four months, and
the steam-heated cars were a luxury
after the chilly nights in Camp Ordway.
.
Reveille sounded at 7 a.m., and the
troopers all enjoyed to the utmost the
privilege of the late sleep.
A stop of one hour was scheduled
here to feed, water and exercise the
horses belonging to Rattery A. The enlisted
men of the two outfits were given
a setting-up drill.
Folks at home need not worry that
any "fair-haired boy" will be hungry
while on this trip south. For supper
last night Troop A cooks served fillet
mignon with side dishes, and for breakfast
there was bacon and eggs, and
plenty of both.
Inspection Is.Gratifying.
Capt. I.ouis C. Vogt of Battery A. who
is commanding the train, made a thorough
Inspection last night of the equipment
and pronounced everything O. K.
Both Capt. Vogt and Capt. James H.
Washburn, commanding Troop A. are
enthusiastic over the way the boys are
behaving and the spirit they are showing.
The District soldiers were given a
real reception here, many of the prominent
citizens coming to the station to
show their hospitality, and when it was
found that the troops would be delayed
here for an hour scores of the soldiers
were taken for automobile rides about
the eitv.
it is expected that the train will reach
Chattanooga shortly after 6 o'clock tonight.
Corp. Joseph "P. Annin and Private
"Vic" Olmstead, both of whom are
newspaper men, are editing a paper
aboard the train for the men of both
units, the troop and the battery.

There is apparently nothing ahead of

seemed tfiat th* troops would see service

BIRMINGHAM, England, October
3.?Viscount Bryce of
Dechmont, former ambassador at
Washington, addressing the Congre'gational
Union today, decried
the spirit of hate against the Germans
and the talk of a lasting
trade war. In conclusion he advocated
a league to restrain' aggression
and compel arbitration.
"If there is to be a recurrence

01 wars, Decoming more ternDic
with the unceasing advance of
science," he said, "we may well
despair of the future."
Wants America to Lead.
Lofd Bryce recalled that Premier
Asquith, Lord Grey an^ Mr. Balfour
had expressed energetically and
sincerely the need of such machinery,
and said that seyeral groups of thinkers
were working out the plans.
? "To establish any machinery for preserving
peace." continued Lord Bryce,
"would be impossible without the ?cooperation
of the neutral states, and
especially the greatest of all the neutral
states. We have been waiting and
watching to see whether America
would, in view of the immense interests
at stake, depart from her old policy of
complete isolation and bear her part
in the effort for securing a permanent
alliance for peace. An influential
league for that purpose already has
been formed there, and now two momentous
events have happened, on
which I dwell because they have been
little noticed here.

"President Wilson delivered four
months ago a powerful and luminous
speech. In which he announced that the
United States could not stand aloof
from a movement in which the highest
interests of manhood were conoerned.
and that he felt sure the people of the
United States were prepared to join
in any feasible scheme for the prevention
of future wars.
"Two months ago Mr. Charles E.
Hughes, in accepting the nomination
as candidate for presidency by the republican
pdrty, declared with no less
force and no less sincerity that he was
convinced the time had come for America
to unite with European countries
in a well considered scheme for applying
methods of arbitration and conciliation
to securing general and permanent
peace in the world.

American parties, distinguished men
and the official exponents of American
opinion, have promised the co-operation
of their nation in this project?
one of great difficulty, no doubt, but
also of supreme importance.
Great Work for Churches.
"Other people and the statesmen who^V
lead our people could have no greater *>
encouragement to address themselves
when the time comes to this enterprise,
which they have already pronounced
to be necessary. I ask your
help to bring the matter before the
people and to show them how much
we and every nation have to gain by
removing the terror and the danger of
war, which so long has hung like a
black cloud over Europe. The churches
;ould do not more truly Christian work.
"Let hot this war have been fought
In vain! Let us search for and try to
put into practice some scheme for reiuclng
and if possible, at least for ending,
this oldest and most terrible
icourge of mankind." a
Lord Bryce said the country was
rlrtually unanimous In. holding that
:he war must be prosecuted to victory
to complete as to open the prospect
if an enduring peace, and addod: "On
he terms of that treaty the people
