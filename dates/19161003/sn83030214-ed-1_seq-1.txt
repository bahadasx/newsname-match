It is an old fact that th*? adjective people use most
oftrn in speaking of statistics. or figurea. is dry.
Figures really are fasc inating?if you know how to
handle them.
That is what makes Garet Garrett's Business Man s
Kinancial Page so interesting. He knows how to
handle the ngures that are its basis. He knows what they
mean and how to tell you about it?which is something
not every financial writer can do. You will see where
he is different. jind therefore actively helpful. if you

GREEK CABINET
OUT; WAR NEAR
Resignations Indicate That
Has Decided to
Join Allies.
King
| London. Ocr. 2.?The Greek Cabinet
' has resigned, aceording to a I'entral
i N'ews diapatch from Athens.
This move has been foreshadowed for
rome time, owing to the refusal of the
Fntente to recognize the ministry of
Premlor Kalogeropoulos. Ita signifi
cance lies m its possible indication of
the attitudc of King Constantine tow
| ard intervention in the war on the side
of the Allies.
N'egotiations for thc enlisfment of
(ireece in the ranka ef the Fntente na
! tions had been greatly hampered by
the retusal or the Allies to deal with
Ka'ogeropoulos's Cabinet, whieh was
bclieved to include several ministers in
sympathy with the Teuton cause.
It was made known yesterday that
King Cor.stantine expected to announce
his decision to enter the war some time
to-day. It was also said or.ee he had
reached a decision a national Cabinet
would BC formed, in consultation v.ith
thi British Minister.
From thi il Baaumed here the
Kir:g ha; determined to east the die and
ia daiayiag tha doelaratien of war until
a new Cabinet can be formed and other
defails arranged. Mobilization of the
army is e-A-pected to be ordered to-mor?
row or Weaacadey.
In the new mitustry II, Kalogeropou?
los probably arill retain the Premier
?4iip, as well as the portfolio of
Finance. while a post will be offered to
ex-Premier Venizelos. M. Stratos, M.

tiOBCd for other places.

Thrce Paths Are Open.
From the tip of the angle fornie*l
by the Danul.e an.l the I'obrudja
Rulgarian border, where the Ruma?
nian army of invasion has won a tirm
grip, King Fenlinand's troops may
ctrike in any one of three direr-tions.
and lie rewarded with important sjc

The most probablo mme woild be

the Danube at the ir.flux of th?* River
Lem. Its importani-e Uaj in the fact
that it is the northern terminus of a
railroad runnint* a'rrwst in a straight
line to Varna, 199 miles to the south
east. It was an important fortres*
under the Turks, and wo'ild serve as
an excellent base for Rumanian oper
ations again.it Bulgariu.
Cor.'.rol of the Kustchnk-Varna rail?
road would essure the i.ucce?s of any
invasion of Hulgaria from the north
east and form a harr-.er from the
Oanuhe to the Black Sea. The jjreatcat
prize beyor.d this line is Shumla, on a
braneh-of this same railway and only
rlve miles we?t of Varna. Thi*
position is of the aigheet importance.
It is ker. that the roads from tha
Panube pass over the Balkan moun
tains and meet the road from Varna.
The next Kumaman rnove posgibly

railroad, out at the envelupment of
