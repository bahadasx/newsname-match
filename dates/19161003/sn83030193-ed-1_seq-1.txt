LONDON, Oct. 3. Field Marshal vj.i
Mackensen, commanding the forces of;
.the central Allies operating against thu
Roumanians and Itumlans In tlic
Srvnco of Dobrudja, linn ordered tho
evacuation of the Danube, fortresses of
Wllstrla and Tutrakan recently enptur-
ra rjy the Teuton, Jiuiganan mm inn:-,
ih forces, says a dispatch from Homo-
to tlio wireless press.
The reason given for tlic withdrawal
of von Mackcnsen's forces Is that the
German commander Is In dancer of
lielng Vnvelopcd by tho Husslans and
It. manliiu troops which have crowd
the Danube between Kustchuk anil
Tntrakan.
Uulgnrlau forces have attacked
, the ltoumanlan nrmy that crosst-d
the Danube and Invaded Ilulgarla
Hunduy and a violent battle is raging
east of thu fortress of Ilustchuk.
An Amsterdam despatch repotted
tbts afternoon Unit tlin Itoumunlans
forced a crossing with little opp'i
Mtlon and thtew up strong entrench
luent.i heforo they wcro attacked,
ltoumanlan monitors llrnt silenced
Hulgarlan shoto batteries ami under
cover of tholr tire thu Invading force.
Was landed.
The size of the nrmy that crossed
tho Duniibo Is not known here, but
Kngllsh military critics ft--day de
clared they believed It iuh composed
of at least 20,0(10. They pointed out
that o amaller force would be pinned
ngalnst the bank of the river by the
Hulgars and would meet the same
fato as the itotimnnlan garrison that
attempted to retreat across the river
from Tutrakan fortress.
A despatch from Holla says tha the
number of Koumanlnns Invading Hul
irarla ts placed at several battalions
by tho Mtilgarlnn War Olllce. The
statement announcing tho passage of
the Danubo by the Invaders says;
"On the Danube near l.lnnoo, be
tween Uustchuk and Tutrnkan, the
enemy convoyed to our banks In
boats several battalions. Measures
have beon taken to attack this force."
MACKENSEN MAY BE TRAPPED
BETWEEN TWO FORCES.
At the same hour that lUmnmni'iiiH
invaded Ilulgorla tho Hussn-llou-liianlans
In Dobrudja launched a
series of heavy attacks, apparently to
prevent the Teutons under Mackenscn
from shifting forces from that region
to meet tho nttnek from the rear.
The battle la golnf on with the
riusso-Roumanlans exerting heavy
pressure against the enemy flanks.
-As Mackenson's present battlo lino
Is eighty miles beyond Tutrakan, u
Roumanian army of any bIz supplied
with artillery, seriously monaccs his
flank and rear. Unless tho Herman
commander has sufficient reserves to
counter this daring lloumanlan move,
military men say his withdrawal from
the entire Dobrudja region niuit fol
low, a retirement that would bo made
with terrific losses, since he would be
constantly fighting tho Husso-Itou-
'manlan army on his front nnd must
meet a new Roumanian army which
would hang onto his flank and tear
during the retreat. ,
Should Msckrnien be driven from
