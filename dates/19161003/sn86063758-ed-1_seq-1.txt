;>LE ASE ENDORSES REFORM
PARTY'S CONVENTION CALL
i
Meeting to be Held In Columbia Fair
Week to Discuss Legislation and
Future of Great State Party.
I
!
j Charleston American.
} Columbia, Sept. 30.?Former Governor
Blease today, in the first public
I statement which he has made since
"the recent primary election, endorsed
i the call issued by Col. W. A. James,
1 of Lee county, for a convention of the
i reform faction of tlit Democratic
i
| party of South Carolina, to be held in
the city of Columbia.
Col. James, after consulting with
Mr. Blease and other leaders in Co!
lumfcii, today, changed tht date of the
i convention to Tuesday of fair week,
October 24th.
The convention will be helcl in the
county court house here, which is convnriiontlv
lnrotpri fnr Sftl<rh T)Ur>DOSe.
Want One Man.
j Every Democratic club in the State
is urged to send at le.ist "one true
and tried reformer," and all members
of the faction are cordially invited
to attend.
"I fully agree," said Mr. Blease, J
"that the reform party should have a '
I. ... i
meeting during fair week, antl I tnmK
Tuesday night, the 24th, is the hest
possible date, which could be selected,
and I trust that as many of our
friends as can do so will attend, and
I have no doubt thist every county in
the State will be fully represented."
Since the call was issued by Col.
James, the convention has been the
subject cf a great deal of compnent,
and much speculation has been indulged
in. Several of the rabid anti|
Blease newspapers have gone into hysI
terics over wihat they see as the pros
pect of a bolt. Neither in the call,
nor in any statement which has been
made by any one authorized to speak,
however, has there been any intimation
of anything of the kind. The
convention when it meets will decide
upon its own course. It is -cj.lled as
** ? G f A
the convention of a iacuou u: mc
Democratic party?and the faction
which its members sincerely believe
is the majority faction in South Carolina
at this time, and was the majority
faction in the recent primaries.
In connection with his statement
endorsing the' mil for the conven|
tion, Mr. Blease was asked this afternoon
if he yet had any statement to
make in reference to the recent pri
mary. x
The Evidence.
| "I am giving very careful and serious
consideration to the evidence furnished
me in reference to. the fraud
in the recent primary," he replied. "I
am satisfied tlD.it there was a very
- ?J and
free use 01 money aim
also the intimidation and coercion of
voters. I am still further satisfied
that I received a majority of the votes
cast in the sccond primary for gov
'
ernor. However, 1 nave uownu6 nether
than this to say for .publication
at this time.1'
It will be recalled that this evidence
was offered to the State executive committee
at its meeting, held here to
tabulate the returns, but was ignored
by ihe committee, whose chairman
ruled out every reference to it except
rpflwns filed bv the six members
of the committee who voted against
the resolution to declare Governor
! Manning the nominee of the party.
{ There is cn anomalous political sit|
nation in South Carolina at this time. '
I It is no: recalled that ever before in
Uie history 01* the primary in this
'State has a State executive committee
failed to name c nominee unanimousA
*
1 ly. At tile recent meeting, nun^u,
the vote was strictly factional, the
resolution expressing their firm coni
viction that the primary was so tainted
with corruption as to endanger the
solidity or tne wane mtui s yen m >
South Carolina. There has so far,
however, "been no authorized statement
which would give any foundation
for the hysterical condition into
" Mch a portion of the press of the
State has "been thrown. As a matter
of fact, the Blease leaders here today,
and those who have been here at va-j
ricus times since ine swuuu immai;,,
take the view that they are really the
majority faction of the Democratic
perty sought to be regulated into a
minority position at the present moment
'by reason of the fact that the
party machinery is in the hands of
what is commonly known as the antiBla.se
faction.
Neither Col. James, Governor Blease
nor any one else authorized to speak
has stated any purpose in the call for
the convention further than was stated
in the cali itself, which was couched
in plain, unyurnished English, simple
enough to be understood by any
school child.
Just Convention.
It will be a convention of representative
white men of South Carolina,
who will peaceably assemble under
t'.cir constitutional right and privileges,
to discuss such measures or po
licies as they may see fit, or to decide
upon such, course of faction as
may seem wise and just to them.
That is all there is to it.
Former Governor Blease is receiving
mamy invitations to deliver ad*dresses
in various parts of the United
States. Among these is an urgent invitntion
to deliver a series of political
?in fho midHlp "west. He is
a P'C C^IlCO 411 m * v*. v.. . ^ ...
in receipt of a telegram asking him
to speak at the Rocky Mount, N. C.,
fair, on October 6, and he is wanted
for an address at the Marshvile, N.
C., county fair on October 21st. The
list also includes inn invitation from
Mount Airy, X. C.. for October 28, and
the Red Men of Salisbury are urging
him to deliver in address to them on
November 1. These are only a lew
among the many invitations, which he
is receiving from various sections of
the country.

anxious to pay. A plan was proposed
and acted upon, "which was caried
i last Sunday morning to a more succussful
termination than was anticipated
t)y the most sanguine member.
After the sermon the plan was put in '
operation, and the fast and easy way j
in which the numbers on the black- '
i board were checked off with the vari- j
ous amounts subscribed showed that i
: the hearts of the people were ripe!
with the fruits of the spirit. In a1
very little while "$3770.50 had been i
raised, leaving only $729.50 to he sub- j
scribed, which will be contributed in j
a very short time, judging by the en- i
couraging and splendid, results or
Snnday morning's efforts. The amounts j
contributed ranged from 50 cents to j
$1,000.; men, women and children giv- j
ing their share and h/.iving a hand in
the noble work. One of the beautiful
features of the happy occasion was j
the act of little George Way, the at- j
tractive and bright four-year-old son |
of Dr. and Mrs. P. E. Way, when he i
nn the aisle and handed fiis !
fifty cents to he placed with the consecrated
fund.
It was a glorious deed done on the j
beautiful Sabbafch morn and made glad :
the heart of the devoted pastor, Rev.
F. E. Dibble, who can go to. confer
ence this year with a happier smile;
and everybody in Newberry hopes he
wil be returned here next year and
the following years of the full term |
to curry on the good work he has i
been doing in this city. The work1
of Sunday morning not only speass;
well for the pastor and the officers
and the congregation, but it will give
Newberry a better and greater name,
and the whole community will rejoice
that the handsome church, edifice, one
of the prettiest and best equipped
in Vcwhprrv with its ma5C

the sweetest of music to thrill the
waiting listeners, will all have been
paid for.
Sunday morning, October 1, 1916,
will be remembered as a red letter day
by the Calendar society and all else
connected with Central church. And
the Lord's prayer, as it was never
prayed before, at the close of the
night's service, marked the end of a
perfect day.
