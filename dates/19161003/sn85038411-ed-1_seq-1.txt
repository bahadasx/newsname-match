Vision of the City-That-Is-to-Be Painted by Civic and
Industrial Leaders
A new era of industrial expansion and civic development for
Harrisburg was fittingly ushered in last evening at the annual dinner
of the Chamber of Commerce in the Masonic Temple with Charles
M. Schwab, E. G. Grace, Edward F. Trefz and a number of other
men of national reputation as the honor guests.
It was the most successful dinner ever given by the local busi
ness organization and the visitors were impressed, they said, with
the deep feeling for civic interest exhibited by the more than 400
diners present.
Briefly some of the city's accomplishments along the lines of
fine parks, adequate water supply, paved streets, improved sewers
and River Front development were traced.
The City-That-Is-To-Be
Then the picture of the city-that-is-to-be was painted. Jn glow
ing words one of the speakers presented the view of the city of a
million population, with still finer parks, adequate and more effective
schools, still greater playground facilities, undreamed-of river de
velopment, smoke-belching factories and feverish mills that never
cease to turn —a contented, happy city where everyone is busy and
where everyone has time to play.
Extension Flans
"We have one or two underlying
principles at Bethlehem." continued
the steel company president. "We are
a big happy co-operative family and
we pay 100 cents on every dollar
earned.
"At Steelton we have a well-defined
line of extensions. As we see the
properties there to-day we will spend
between fifteen and twenty millions
just as fast as Mr. Bent asks for the
appropriations."
Later Mr. Schwab confirmed tnis
prediction of Mr. Grace and declared
that the total cost of the improve
ment program of the Bethlehem in
terests for the next three years calls
for about $90,000,000. He intimated
that a hundred million would be spent
before the plans were perfected.
In introducing Mr. Schwab the
toastmaster hinted that down in
Steelton the scholars usually skip the
early part of history and start in on
the page telling of Schwab- —"because
there was nothing doing before his
time." Mr. Gilbert declared Schwab
"looked good to the Chamber of Com
merce and he only hoped it looked
good to him."
Mr. Schwab prefaced his remarks
with a story at the expense of a
newspaperman who tried to interview
him earlier in the day and then paid
one of the highest tributes ever given
a steel man to President Grace.
Tribute to Grace
"Mr. Grace Is a remarkable man,"
said he. "I want to say something
nice and something true aDOut him.
He has had the most remarkable
career of any young man I ever knew.
I regard him as at the very head of
the steel manufacturing industry in
the United States. I predict for him
a further career that w*:t e a pride
to us all. Judge Gary recently said

ests."
"Gentlemen, your toastmaster has
expressed a hope. I don't express the
hope—you DO look good to me. I
hope to be one of you und to visit you
often.
Up to Bent
Mr. Schwab also paid a glowing
I tribute to Quincy Bent, general man
j ager of the Steelton plant when he
said;
We feci we have made a re
markable acquisition when we se
cured the Pennsylvania Steel com
pany because we acquired Mr.
Bent. If we have obtained noth
ing else we have him. If Steel
ton succeeds it will be because
of Mr. Bent. He is to be the ab
solute power there and what ho
recommends will be done—and I
might say he isn't a bit modest In
his recommendations. They come
in with such rapidity that Mr.
Grace is kept busy signing Uie
authorizations."
Mr. Schwab declared his chief in
terest in life is the success of his mills
! and their development. He told of
the early days when he never drew
in dividend from the Bethlehem plant
j but put every cent it earned right
j back into development.

When an Adams Express com

Third and Market streets at 8 o'clock
this morning a small can bounced ofT,
and the fun started. The lid was
Jarred off and the goldfish Inside took
a swim on the asphalt. Traffic officers
and pedestrians aided in the rescue,
but six of the little fishes are swim

on their way to freedom.

The outburst followed a quotation

an "outrage passed by Congress and
approved by the President."
