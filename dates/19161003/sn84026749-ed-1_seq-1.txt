soldiers remained long enough to re

the Hrlstollans and talk with the bevy
of girls, who flocked about the train.
All of the cavalrymen and artillery
men were as happy as larks and seem
ed to be enjoying themselves Even
the fact that they arc traveling as
freight and that the train Is side
tracked every half hour or so, falls to
disturb their equanimity. They relish
the travel as a relief from thu mo

T"e artists in the audience, notably
Mr. McDonald' and Mrs. Tompkins,
were enthusiastic In their praise of
the film and the manner In which the
lory was told and the picture ex
hibited. Manager Moore waa much encourag
ed by the views his audience express
ed and will seek another opportunity
to have Commissioner Brownlow see
the film personally. He ' expressed
himself as willing to eliminate any
part of the film the Commissioner
thought was not proper to be shown,
but he made the point that the Com
missioner himself sHould see It before
ho finally condemned It.
Perhaps the mqst Indignant person

Attack Army That Crossed Danube Without
Opposition Under Cover.of Fire From
Monitors in. River East of the
Fortress of Rustchuk.
LONDON, Oct. 3. Bulgarian forces have attacked
the R6umanian army that crossed the Danube and invaded
Bulgaria Sunday, and a violent battle is raging east of the
fortress of Rustchuk.
An Amsterdam dispatch reported this afternoon that
the Roumanian forces effected a crossing with little oppo
sition, and threw up strong entrenchments before they were
attacked. Roumanian monitors first silenced Bulgarian
shore batteries, and under cover of their fire their invading
force was landed.
An official statement from the Bulgarian war office,
delayed in transmission, declared that preparations had been
made to attack the Roumanian force.
A Rome wireless dispatch this afternoon said it was re
ported from Petrograd that Field Marshal Mackensen or
dered the evacuation of the Dobrudja fortress of Silistra
and Tutrakan after the Roumanians crossed the Danube.
ARMY ESTIMATED AT 20,000.
The size of the army that crossed thc
Danube Is not known here, but English
military critics today declared they be
lieved It was composed of at least 20,000
men. They pointed out that a smaller
force would be pinned against the bank
of the river by the UiiIruis, and would
meet the same fate as tho Roumanian
garrison that attempted to retreat
acrosn thc river from Tutrakan fortress,
At thc same hour that Roumanians in
vaded Bulgaria, the Russo-Roumanlans
In Dobrudja launched a series of heavy
attacks, apparently to prevent the
Teutons from sntrting rorces irom mat
region. Oho1 bnltle Is going on with
the Russo-Roumanluns exerting heavy
pressure against the enemy flanks.

ing In the Balkans has shifted Interest

and also from the Busslan front, where
severe fighting' Is reported. Along the

Submarine Warfare Thought
Fruitless.
By CARL W. ACKERMAN.
BERLIN, Oct. 3.-Efforts of tho Von
Tlrplts party to, force a resumption of
submarine warfare will be defeated aa
the result of tho conference now being
held In secret session of thc Belchstag
committee, It Is now generally believed.
The Tlrpitxltes, however, hope to force
a public discussion of the whole ques
tion when the Reichstag reconvenes
Thursday,
Ernest Bssserman, gray-haired Na
tional Liberal party leader, and one of
the moat Important figures In tho Reich
stag, declared today after the question
has been aired In the budget committee
meetings, It will be fully discussed In
open session.
"We wish to live In peace and friend
ship with America." said Basserman,
"but undoubtedly there Is b'.tter feeling
hero because American supplies of am
munition enable our enemies to con
tinue tho war.
"If America should succeed In forcing
England to obey International law, te
storo freedom of the seas, and proceed
with American energy against Eng
land's brutallxatlon of neutrals. It would
have a decisive Influence on the politi
cal situation botween tho two coun
tries." "Do you think submarine warfare will
be renewed?" he was asked.
"That must be decided by the foreign
office, the ministry of marine, and the
general staff," was the reply. "Eng-

System Will Not Require Addi

Over Schedules.
Beginning November I street
car patrons in the' District are to
enjoy the novel experience of al
sways finding a seat in non-rush
hours and o fnever being com-'
pelted in rush hours to stand on
each others corns.
That is to say, that will be their
experience if the new rules just
adopted by the Public Utilities
Commission for a standardization
of street car service work out in

ory. SPACE REQUIRED.
These rules state that during non
rush hours street car companies mlMt
maintain on tho iveragc a service of
125 sceata for every 100 passengers car
ried; and that during the rush liourfl
each standing passenger must on thc
average have seven square fct of
space in which to awing from a strap,
and never lesa than three square feet.
The rush hours arc fixed as being be
tween 6 '30 and i;V o'clock In the morn

afternoon..
Under these rules, no ear on, the Mt.

Center-Door Car.
In the case of the center-opening
cars the basis in rush hours would be
a total of srxty passengers, forty-eight
of whlmr would be seated and twelve
standing.
In tho case of the cars of the Capital
Traction Company, auch as those In

the new rules are expected to produce.
While they are designed to Improve

all lines. In other words, they art
based on what months of observation

Into consideration.
Means of Enforcement.
By way of enforcing them, a simple
expedient Is to be adopted. In the first
place tt Is figured that In order to In

furnish sufficient cars en that a mini

be available In rush hours, the commis

auch cars would pass a given point In a
single halt hour period. If these ten

It would be proof that not enough ears

The same kinds of obaervatlons would
