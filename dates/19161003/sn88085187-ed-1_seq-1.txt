Ornispaprr i nt<-t pri-r AftaoWutlon)
NEW YORK, Oct. 3.—Are the allies preparing St. Helena for the kaiser
of Germany—in the event they win lhe war, as they certainly believe they
are going to do ?
This is mi fantastic question, asked for the sake of
sensationalism, and baaed merely on wartime rumors,
Instead it is an outgrowth of the MAJOR TOPIC of cer
tain grim deliberations now taking place in the entente
capitals of Europe.
J KNOW it lathe major topic, tho "prime intention*'
of the big nion of the allies, for the iok and simple reason
that 1 heard them DISCUSSING ii myself]
And the question in high circles of London and
France now is not so much whether er not the allies can
wreak vengeance on the kaiser IX PERSON, Il is
simply WHAT this punishment shall be!
A TREMENDOUS PERSONAL DRAMA THAT
WILL STARTLE THE EYES OP THE WORLD is
CERTAINLY OOING TO ACCOMPANY THE DE
NOUEMENT OF THK WAR!
Of this I am positive —that in those final negotia
tions when the fate of nations, the happiness of whose
peoples, are at stake, so fiery a drama will involve, in
some measure, at least, the lionse of Hohenzollern, that
it will obscure in the eyes of the world all those other
questions —questions of frontiers, of indemnities and the
like! For granting that the allies will have any debatable
rights at tlie war's end, the discussion of the fate of Em
peror William like that of Achilles, Caesar and Napoleon,
is hound to go down into history as one so engrossing to
the popular mind that it oelipses in interest the world
events in which he played a part!
Merely as Rome tangible proof of the widespread existence of this
prim determination on the part of the allies, of England in particular,
to mete out a dire fate to the kaiser personally, 1 will cite to you the pub
lic testimony of Dr. Henjamln Hand,philosophical librarian at Harvard
university, given on the dock at New York, after a long visit to England.
Dr. Ram) said: ...  ,  ,
"One of Hie fre*t|uent nott** IM heard struck at tlie meetings held on the MNM anni
versary of the war was to the effect that tin* l\l)l\ IDIAI, guilty must not be allowed to
escape, and the malefactors responsible for the sinking of the I.iisitanla and the murders of
Miss t'avell and Capt. Fryatt must lie punished!" ■____,
Aa to who "the Individual responsible" is, nobody in England has the least doubt. English
men speaking of It hardly ever consider it necessary even to mention his name. Frenchmen, how
ever frequently speak openly of "the coming court martial of the defendant, Hohenzollern."
'The Uiitis'h government through Premier As(|uilh, lias given two distinct pledges of uncom
promising punishment pledges that aro aimed not only at the kaiser, hut at the Hohenzollern
dynasty, and all the directing officers of the OWBtM'"•£______- „ 
On \prll 27, MlB, he declared "WITH AM- DEMHEKATIOV* that the -government
would hold it Its duly to exact reparation against "the guilty agent*, and actors in the mat
ter " and July SI last, following the murder of ('apt. Fryatt, he emphatically reiterated the
Intention of the government to bring to justice the criminals "WHOEVER" they might be,
and "WHATEVI It" might he thHr positions!
The allies mean by this none other than Emperor \\ llllam himself, and do not consider In ths
least a joke the fact that the kaiser was found guilty of murder by the Jury of Klnsale after ths
Lusltania horror. ____________________
I n n. li legal experts declare that hy Oermany s own acts she recognize* the right of a
nation to try a criminal AT THE SHOT WHKHH THE CHIME WAS COMMITTED, regard
less of the nationality of the criminal. Thla recognized doctrine, they assert, will make the
solemn trial of Emperor William Uf military or civil tribunals at Mile, and in Helgium and
In England and Serbia binding under International law, whatever may be the sentence!
Will that sentence—depending, of course, upon the allies being victorious—consist in
banishment for life to Ht. Helena? ,..,.•, i „.,., _
Kverv word spoken by those in a position lo know Indicates that banishment of the Ho
heti/.oilerii« would be the'punishment. In that case St. Helena would be the logical place.
To this volcanic island ol 47 square miles' area, Oreat Britain has sent many of her prisoners
of war Including Oen. Cronje and other Iloeis. But of course the case of Napoleon is the great prece
dent to which the allies polht for paralhls. ...,,„„, . , ... ...
Hut CAM THE AM-IES CATCH THE KAISEH? Even If his armies should lie completely
The"Germans are known to have several trump cards that they would surely play to euchre such
an outcome: The only reason KapotoOß did not flee to America was that there was no way of mak
ini£ his escape Emperor William, it is known, would choose the United Stales as his foster land,
In the event of the great disaster to his armies which no German now admits Is possible. For the
United States is the only great power that has not turned against hlni. Even Brazil, supposedly the
center of a powerful German colony, has voted Its open sympathy with the allies.
And for Emperor William there would be a definite avenue of escape to America. How?
Well I was seriously told In London that tho recent trip of the submarine trader Ueutschland
to Baltimore was really only AN EXPERIMENTAL VOYAGE— with a distant purpose in mind, con
nected with William II of Germany! In the last days of the war. some Londoners firmly believe,
there will be a special express train made up in Berlin ready In the event of final defeat to take a
cleaved track to Wllhelmshaven!
/Hid nay these prophets—the kaiser would be safely brought to Baltimore under the
Atlantic ocean by Capt. Koenlg of the IDeutscliland!
