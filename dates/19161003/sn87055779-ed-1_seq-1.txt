Aiant raea.t Dilator.
Judge Warner to Quit Bench
Oct. 10 Mayor Keller
Lets Matter Drop.
The resignation of Judpe Herbert
I. Warner from the bench of the
city' court, which is to take effect
Oct. 10, wa mailed to Gov. Ralston
Tuesday morning. Mr. Warner had
yiniLied his intention of resigning
some time apo when the question
arose a.s to the repository of the
authority to appoint his successor
arose.
This action of Jtidere Warner prac
tically places, tri this particular
case, the power of appointing the
new judte of the city court, to
yerve until the expiration of the
term on Jan. 1. RMS, into the hands
of the governor, since Mayor Keller
declared that he would let the mat
ter drop unless the resignation were
tendered to hiru. Since he will
uirt no action to 'set aside or to
tontest the appointment that the
governor will make, it is practically
assured that the governor's ap
pointment will stand approved.
In the manner of appointing the
successor to a vacancy in the city
court of an Indiana city, there is a
nice question of law concerned.
Three sections of the code of laws
entitled the "Cities and Towns Act"
passed in ltoi.'i and relating to the
government of Indiana cities, de
clare that the power of Mppointinp
tile successor to the citv court
bench, in case of a acatuy. rests
in the mayor of the particular city.
Four years later the first of these
sections. No. 4.", was amended, giv
ing the power of appointment to
the governor of the stat?. Neither
at that tune nor later, however, has
there been a repeal passed recall
ing the latter two sections which
must, therefore still be in operation.
Since the state law declares that in
passing an amendment to a code
law, all sections not amended are
by the fact of the amendment, re
enacted, the code as it stands con
tains within itself, one section giv
ing the particular power of ap
pointing the city judge to the gov
ernor, and two sections giving gen
eral appointive power to the mayor.
Further, the law : at irives the
weight of power to the act last
passed does not apply to acts re
"rttimr to a single subject but only
to conflicting acts on different sub
jects. The question in thi matter
has never 1 en settled in any court,
nor is it likely that it will be
brought to a test, owing to the de
claration of Mayor Keller, in which
he maintained that he would not
start action.

w hich showed that the syndicate has

From the maze of testimony given

of it extracted by the "corkscrew"
process Charles 1 Clyne, United
States district attorney, is convinced
the operations of the trust are nation-wide,
and that action can be
begun under the lottery' section of
the United .States statutes.
"I am investigating the govern

Clyne today. . "I believe the exist

established by the testimony before
Judge Landis."

Sees Signs of Gradual Change
in America's Views of
Use of Divers.
International News Service:
HF.UFIX, Oct. Hope that the
1'nited States "will take a more
reasonable view should Germany
be compelled again to renew ruth
less submarine warfare," is express
ed in a lorg article by Dr. Fernhard
Dernburg, in the F.erliner Tageblatt.
The former special emissary of
th" kaiser to America, hints that
a full-tledeed F-boat campaign may
have to be resorted to "in order to
force Fngland to make peace." He
adds that there are signs of a grad
ual chango of America's views in
this respect, owing to England's
"domineering attitude toward neu
trals." He justifies Pres't Wilson's
stand throughout the submarine
controversj in the past, saying a
different attitude would "deserve
contempt and annihilation."
Dr. Dernburg points out that any
statesman like Pres't Wilson should
justly consider it his chief duty to
serve the present and future pros-1
tige of the Fnited States, increase j
its influence upon the western con-'
tinent and the adjacent sens and
seek lor the world's peace which,
he adds, would make possible the
exploitation by America of the yet
largely dormant economical forces
of that vast country.
Dr. Dernburg admits that this is
a policy which, while popular in
America, hf; in some cases seriously
affected Gorman interests. It is
necessary', however, he asserts, that
America should reeognie Germany's
own particular requirements.
Dr. Dernburg further describes
the astonishment with which he

Thousands of Gallons of Milk
Emptied in the Road
side Ditches.
International News Sorvi.
NKW YOllK, Oct. ."..Violence
has begun to mark the war between
the big milk dialers and the upstate
farmers.
Irving P. Waite of Wingdale lies
in a Dutchess county hospital at the
point of death. Men lying in ambush
behind bushes set upon him while
he was trying to take a load of milk
to the station. He was beaten into
unconsciousness. Thousands of gal
lons of milk have been emptied in
the roadside ditches of New York
and New Jersey.
Meanwhile prospects of the
threatened milk famine in New York
city being averted, are stadily
darkening. The hopes of the New
Y'ork public are pinned upon the
outcome of the investigation heuun
by Atty. Gen. Woodbury. The point
at issue is whether either side, or
both, have iolated the Donnelly
anti-trust law.
Today's milk supply was less than
f0 per cent of the normal deliveiy.
State Commissioner of Foods and
Markets John J. Dillon predicted to
day that by Friday the city will y
practically without milk.
The dealers stand pat on their re
fusal to treat with the Dairymen's
league. They derar- that arrange
ments are beinc made to get a full
supply regardless of the New York
farmers, but refuse to dis.-lose thir
