REPUBLICANS AT
THE LIHUE HALL
The candidates for nomination on
the Republican ticket for the Legis
lature appeared before a mixed
audience in Lihuc Social hall Fri
day evening. II. D. Wishard, chair
man of the Board of Supervisors,
presided and A. G. Kaulukou offi
ciated as interpreter. An orchestra
of Hawaiian musicians supplied the
usuai essential in the intermissions,
i In his opening remarks Chairman
yA Wishard stated that each speaker
:i .-would be limited to fifteen minutes,
after which he introduced Chas. H.
Wilcox, candidate for the House.
Mr. Wilcox stated that he was
not a public speaker. He was a can
didate for the House of Representa
tives in response to a sence of duty
as a good citizen. He had no bones
to pick in the Legislature; no axes
to grind. He wanted to go there to
see that the money of the people
would be expended in the proper
way. Mr. Hughes states that he is
not looking for a political future.
The speaker was also not seeking
political advantage. M.r. Wilcox
called attention to the other candi
dates seeking votes at the primary,
and dwelt particularly upon the
long and splendid record of J. 11.
Coney in the Legislature conclud
ing this part of his speech by say
inir flint if the audience voted for
him (Wilcox) he would also prefer
that they vote for Coney. From
that point he made an appeal to
the effect that no small or personal
grudge be permitted to influence
voters. The Democratic candidates
were nominated already. They had
no opposition. With the Republi
cans there were more candidates
than places to be filled, in conse
quence of which they were fighting
between themselves. Ho requested
his hearers to vote Republican in
the primary, and if any weroDemo

Forbes Coming Over
Charles R. Forbes, superintendent
of public works, will probably ar
rive on Kauai tomorrow on an im

such road, wharf and other matters
as como under his department for
the purposo of submitting rccom
mendatians to the governor who, in
turn, will pass them onto the legis
lature in February.

JAPANES
E
Upon his return to Honolulu
Japanese Consul Moroi gave to the
press the following highly interest
ing opinions concerning Japanese
labor conditions on this island:
I have spent 12 days on Kauai
and during that time 1 met more
than 5000 Japanese men and women
and also their children. This was
my first visit to that island. I in
spected every plantation where our
people are employed. I am more
than satisfied with conditions on
the plantations. The laborers arc
also pleased with their treatment. I
have heard often about the bonu
question since I have been here,
but there was no talk about the
system on Kauai. The laborers did
not make any complaint to me.

Kauai At San Diego
Reports coming fiom the cxposi
tion at San Diego have never been
very complimentary as to the show
ing being .made by this Territory
The following is an extract from
letter of a Kauai man, just received:
'We took in the San Diego fair
vith its wonderful Hawaiian school
exhibit, showing. one of Prof. B ra
dio's wonderful open-air school
buildings, filled with Japanese baby
dolls. The Hawaiian exhibit con
tained also one broken and discard
ed outrigger canoo and a grass
skirt."
Kauai Registration
County Clerk J.M. Kaneakua kept
his office open until 12 o'clock last
Tuesday night for the registration
of voters. At the close 1358 names
were on the great register. In the
last election a little more than 1,100
voted, out of a total of 1,250. Elim
inating known absentees, etc., it
is figured that the actual vote in
tho primary will bo around 1,100.
CONSUL
AND KAUA
ARMY OFFICERS
COMING TO U
General Robert K. Evans, com
mander of the Department of Ha
waii, U. S. Army, will arrive on
Kauai tomorrow morning and will
remain here until Saturday. Jie
will be accompanied by his aide de
camp, liieut. Jlornsoy h,vans, and
ijy Major Chas. S. Lincoln..
It is stated that the trip is merely
for pleasure, but it is understood
that the General would like to see a
few of the Kauai companies at drill
and meet the officers.
Information i n hand docs not
make it clear as to whether the party
will land at Nawiliwili or go on
to Wainica. It is assumed, how
ever,- that Nawiliwili will be the
place, particularly as. Colonel Broad-
bent will be a passenger from Hono
lulu by the same boat.
Some function will most likely be
arranged for the commanding gen
eral, but just what, when or where
will not bo decided until Colonel
Broadbent returns tomorrow.
General Johnson was detained at
Honolulu on other matters and
could not accompany the party.
Under the heading 'General
Evans will inspect Kauai militia"
the Advertiser of Monday morning
said :
To look over the Island of Kauai
from a military standpoint, Biig.
Gen. Robert K. Evans, command
ing the Hawaiian department, to
gether with Capt. Hornsby EvaiiSj
aide, and Maj. ChailesS. Lincoln,
in charge of militia affairs, will
leave tomorrow for practically a
week's stay.
This will be General Evan's first
trip to the 'Garden Island. Major
Lincoln who has been twice on Ka
uai before, will play the part of
guide to a certain'extent.
It is probable that the officers
will bo entertained during the week's
visit by officers of the Kauai guard
regiment, the Fourth Infantry.
Lihue Union Church
"A good choir, a good audience
and a fine sermon" this was the in
telligent comme'nt o f a leading
member of the community at the
close of the service on Sunday; to
which he might have added "beau
tiful decorations".
Great interest .and efficiency have
been developed in the choir of late,
thanks largely to some very valu
able new additions and it is under
stood that some most enjoyable sur
prises are being planned for the
future. The church draws from a
wide constituency, one party com
ing all the way from Eleeie.
Credit To Mr. Lydgate
The last annual report of the
Bishop museum gives credit to Mr.
J. M. Lydgate for the discovery of
several now plants in the high
mountains of Kauai sonic of which
have been given his name. The
mountains of these Islands have been
so diligently, and so systematically
searched for so many-years, that it
takes a very keen eye and very pa
tient endeavor to find anything
new m tho plant line.

A PICNIC PART!
AT KOLOA BEACH
Mrs. G. F. Rankin and a number
of Makaweli girls were hostesses last
Friday evening at a very enjoyable
picnic, given at the new Knudsen
beach house at Koloa.
The party assembled late in the
afternoon, in time for a refreshing
swim, before silting down to a very
delicious chowder supper. A quintet
furnished music for dancing during
the evening.
Among those present were: Mr.
and Mrs. G. F. Rankin, Misses Et
ta Lee, Thompson, Marie Ander
son, G. Nelson, Williams and Leo
na Jobson. Messrs. Smith, Carden,
Morrow, Lyman, Cooper, McBoyle,
Vincent, Patterson and Dcverill.
E
GETS A SOAKING
It is not often that it rains at Ele
eie," but when it does the rain is
very wet. The school cottage roofs
there are evidently constructed on
the open-work, Hour-sieve plan
which is admirable for, ventilation
but very defective! for keeping the
rain out.
A few days ago found the cot
tagers in a state of topsy-turvy chaos,
in the vain endeavor to gather
tilings together in a dry spot. There
were lakes on the floor, "and ponds
in the chairs; tho rugs were rolled
up into dykes to restrain the ad
vancing floods, and the only safe
place was the dining table where
one perched high and dry with an
umbrella overhead, like Noah's ark
on Mount Ararat.
Despite the inconvenience and
discomfort the teachers took the ex
perience with a pleasant, smiling
equanimity, as all in the day's
work in a semi-civilized country
like Hawaii.

Honolulu The strike deadlock is likely so break inside of a few
hours. While developments on the surface are unimportant, shipping
men are expecting to act. Stevedores appeal to the coast fcr help. They
have also sent word to Australia that certain cargoes were unloaded here
in an unfair manner.
Important steps have been taken foe frontage tax improvements,
the supervisors opening the way for general development under the law,
the object being to make Honolulu beautiful. A few of the projects are
now under way. with others to be started.

proved nearer the size of Hanapepe.
