ROUMANIAN ARMY'
PUSHES INVASION
Crossing Danube, Troops Ad
vance on Bulgarian Soil.
lBy the laterastieaul News service.)
London. O.ct. :-An nvasinn of Bul
garia by Roumanian troops who crossed
the Danube yesterday at a point almost
directly south of Bucharest and about
ifty miles from the capital Is believed
to have an important strategic bearing
on the complicated military operations in
Eastern Europe.
The passage of the river occurred be
tween Rustchuk. a strongly defended Bul
garian city, and Turtukal, the fortress
wrested from the Roumanians with heavy
losses in men and supplies immediately
following her entry into the war.
Although details are lacking. it is be
lieved here that ironclads, which have
beth operating in the lower reaches of
the great river, covered the transporta
tion of the troops.
Contemporaneously with the invasion.
the Russian-Rounsanian army which has
been contesting Von Mackensen's advance
in Dobrudja began an offensive along
the whole front.
"We .repulsed the Bulgarian-Teuton
army on its center and right." says an
official report from Bucharest tonight.
The two movements are nelIeved by
critics here to be parts of a singl plan.
and related closely as well to It more
active prosecution of the -ur. 1-n in
Macedonia. The enterprise as a whole
Is aimed at cutting off Turkey and Bul
garia.
The German war office today reports
the passage of the Danube.

CLUE FROM CHICAMiO
IN DROWNINi MYSTERY
J. E. Swartz Asks Alexandria to Hold
Woman's Body.
The Alexandria police wero notitied last
night that a telegram had been re-elved
by the Washington police from J. F. v
Swartz, of Chicago. requesting that the r
body of the unidentified woman, whose c
body was found in the Potomac River C
near Mt. Vernon September 24. be held at I
Wheatley's undertaking establishment in
Alexandria until his arrival.
It is believed Swartz may identify the t
body. If he does, it will be because of a I
Wells Fargo Co. express receipt, dated a
September 22, which was found on the c
river bank by James Young. This re
ceipt showed that a consignment had been C
made to "Mrs. J. E Swartz." As the
woman's clothes were marked "Marshall
Field. Chicago," the Chicago police were
notitled, with the result that the Swartz
telegram was received last night.
No solution of the mystery has been
reached through the piecing together of y
a railroad check found with the express
receipt. A trunk at the Union Station
was opened yesterday by railroad offilials t
in the presence of Harrie White, Justice
of the peace in Fairfax county. and W.
Clifton Cunningham, representing Mr.
Wheatley. It contained women's cloth- d
ir of good quality, but the garments
gave no clue to the identity of the owner.
The trunk was shipped from Huntington.

police hav c been asked to try to identify
