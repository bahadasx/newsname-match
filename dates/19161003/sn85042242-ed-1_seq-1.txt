Bismarck Assessment Warrants
Sell for Premium of
$1,100
TELEPHONE COMPANY
TO PUT WIRES UNDER
Allowed Nine Days To Get Con­
duits in—Drainage Presents
Problem
"That is the record price for as­
sessment warrants in North Dakota
—you ought to be prqud of your cred­
it, gentlemen," declared S. L. Heeter
of the Wells-Dickey Co. of Minneapo­
lis, at 12:01 this morning, when $90,
000 worth of Bismarck's paving bonds
were sold at per cent par, a premi­
um of $£l-00 and accrued interest.
The price at which. the warrants
were sold will bring the cost of Bis­
marck's first paving money below 5
per cent. The bid specified that $60,
000 worth of the bonds were to be is
suedi this fall, and the remaining $30,
000 in lots pf $20,000 as needed, on or
before June 1,1917. P. C. Remington
was low bidder.
Because of a wire received from
the Northern Pacific, advising that
it always makes a practice of paying
cash for special improvement work,
as the assessments are presented,
the original issue of $120,000, "more
or less," was cut down to $90,000 for
last night's bidding. The, remaining
$30,000 will be paid in cash, probably
next July, to this further extent re­
ducing the interest charge on Bis­
marck's first paving venture.
To Rtip For Twenty Years.
The bonQsi sold last evening will
run for 201 years. They will be in de­
nomination^. of $1,000 and will bear
6 per ^npljitterest. The premium of­
fered.'$Qiea)s1*b^ 1.01 per cent, re­
ducing tlie Interest rate to 4.99 per
cent, while accrued interest will be
refunded on $30,000 in warrants which
may not be issued until next June,
when Hanlon & Okes expect, to com­
plete their cbifthict 'In District" No. 1.
"North Dakota assessment warrants
usually have sold for 7 per cent, with
a premium, or at 6 per cent par,"
stated the Dickey-Wells representa­
tive last «1rening after the contract
had been awarded. Four bids were
received)' John F. Sinclair & Co. ad­
vised by wire that they would pay
par and a premium of $1,846 for an
issue of $120,000, more or less, for im­
mediate issue. Inasmuch as it had
been found necessary to reduce the
bond issues to $90,000, and since a
certified check did not accompany the
Sinclair bid, it was not considered.
On the issue of $90,000 it would have
paid a premium of about $1,440, for
fhe immediate issue of the entire
amount, had the same terms held.
The commission had no means of as­
certaining that the company would
accept a smaller issue for the same
price. W. B. S. Trimble Co. of James­
town, through its secretary, John Mc
Elroy, ranked as second highest bid­
der on the warrants as issued, retir­
ing from the field with an offer of
$1,090. The Wells-Dickey Co. gave up
when the price passed $1,055. The
bidding was spirited and interesting,
although good feeling prevailed
throughout. President Lucas proved
an excellent auctioneer, boosting the
price $200 from the Trimble com­
pany's original offer of $900, "as is­
sued." In connection with the con­
sideration of bids submitted by wire,
it was brought out that the Mandan
paving bpnds Jiad been sold under
somewhat, sfttytyftr conditions and that
the contract tfas not' satisfactory.
Hanlon & Okes expect to complete
two-thirds of their contract this fall.
Telephone Wire* Go Under.
Nine days was given the North Da­
kota Telephone company in which to
get its wires underground in the down
town paving district. The company
advised that it has a carload of con­
duit material enroute from Minneapo­
lis and that it should be "in the
clear" by a week from Wednesday.
The big trencher which did the work
for the gas company will be used in
ditching, and with a large force 6n
the job the company expects to cover
a block daily. Conduits will be laid
with two, four, six and eight sections,
according to the amount of traffic to
be accommodated. The conduits will
go in on EToadway from Second to
Seventh on Fifth from a point 100
feet north of Broadway to the North­
ern Pacific, and on Seventh from
Broadway to the east side of Main.
The motion introduced by the paving
committee was that ^the telephone
company make arrangements with
Hanlon & Okes to lay conduits on
these streets, provided it does not
delay paving to exceed nine days.
To Make Sewer Connections.
Sewer connections ahead of the
paving will be made by Grai
Peet, whose bid of 80 cents the
foot north of Main and $1.80 on MS
for 6-inch pipe, was accepted. Com­
paratively few connections are to be
made under this contract, which con­
templates the assessment of the cost
against the property owners. A num­
ber of connections have been made

Movies of First Regiment in
Camp at Mercedes To Be
Tbwwn on Screen Here
RIOT NARROLY AVOIDED
IN ROW AT MERCEDES
rMerWires lPexa^.^6i&t.i.'2 —People of
Bismarck will within a week or two,
perhaps, have the opportunity of see­
ing the First North Dakota regiment,
give a bayonet drill, infantry charge
and other maneuvers. The regiment
won't be back in North Dakota and
they won't see the boys in the flesh,
but they will look as natural as life
itself, for one of the best film cor­
porations in the country took a mov
ing picture of the First regiment on
the parade and drill grounds, and
they are to be exhibited throughout
the country, together with realistic
scenes of the camp at Mercedes.
The North Dakota boys have the
reputation for being the most peace
able bunch of fellows of any regiment
in this section, but when there is any­
thing going on in the way of a fight
they seem to find themselves mixed
up in it—not as participants, but as
peacemakers. A near-riot occurred
on the principal business street of
Mercedes the other night when a dep
uty sheriff struck a soldier of A Com­
pany over the head with his six-shoot
er because, so it is reported, he re­
fused to vacate an automobile in town
after the driver had agreed to take
him to camp from Llano Grande. Co
A happened to have a provost guard
on military duty in the town at the
time and it did not take them long
to quell the disturbance that resulted
when about 100 soldiers from all or­
ganizations who were near the scene
rushed to the spot.
Much conjecture on the "going
home" plans of the powers that be
was indulged in when the inquiry was
received asking how many overcoats
the quartermaster lacked to outfit the
regiment. Requisition for sweaters
has been in for some time, but when
the overcoat inquiry was received it
began to seem that the plans were
for a protracted stay on the border.
But even if they do remain on the
border all winter, the boys from
North Dakota will find little use for
either overcoats or sweaters, as the
weather here in the middle of the
winter seldom gets to freezing and
then only for a few days at a time,
when a "norther" strikes.
The Third battalion has received
orders to prepare to take outposts
for active patrol duty along the Rio
Grande. Companies and E expect
to leave Thursday and Companies
and Saturday. They will be sta­
tioned at Mercedes Pumping Station,
Progreso, Champion Store and Donna
Pumping Station, respectively, and
will remain on outpost duty for two
weeks. The Mercedes Pumping sta­
tion, at which Company will be sta­
tioned, contains the great pumps
which pump the water from the Rio
Grande at the rate of 360,000 gallons
per minute into the 3360-acre reser­
voir from which it flows by gravity
into the main irrigating canal of ibe
ystem. Here the boys will have the
opportunity of bathing and *he fish

Villa Says He Is Fighting "Only
the Traitor Car-_
ranza"
El Paso, Tex., Oct. 2.—Villa told
the Mexican mining men at San An­
dres, Chihuahua, after capturing that
town from Carranza troops under Gen­
eral Jose Cavazos, September 24, that
he had no enmity toward the Amer­
icans and asked them to notify their
American friends to resume work at
their mines in Eastern Chihuahua as
he would give them all guaranties, ac­
cording to two Mexican mining men,
who arrived here last night, from San
Andres.
Villa, in an impassioned address to
the townspeople, claimed he was fight­
ing "only the traitor Carranza." He
announced at Santa Ysabel and San
Andres that he would return in a few
days and any male resident of the
town over the age of fourteen, who
was not ready to take up arms with
him would be put to death, the min­
ing men stated. Villa got 100 re­
cruits at these two villages befefe
marching toward Cusihuiriachic, they
said.
Following the battle with Carranza
troops under General Matias Ramos
at Cusihuiriachic, September 26,
Francisco Villa, Joe Yenz Salzar and
their joint command, left the mining
town of Cusi after looting it of food
supplies, killing several civilians and
impressing all able bodied men into
their command, a resident of the Cusi­
huiriachic mining district, who arriv­
ed here reported today.

mony of a highly developed organiza­
tion for gambling, which the police
previously declared did not exist, city
authorities scurried around and un­
covered evidence of a baseball pool,

He said that the sentiment in New

Hughes. In New York city, neither
the republicans nor democrats had
begun active organization work yet,
and there was considerable doubt as
to the situation.
Plans for Charles E. Hughes' third
