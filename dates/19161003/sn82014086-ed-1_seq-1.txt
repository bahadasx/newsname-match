RUMANIANS HAVE
INVADED BULGARIA
Rumanians Have Made Their Way to the Southern
Bank of the Danube in the Upper Reaches
VERNA, BULGARIA'S CHIEF SEAPORT IN DANGER
Center and Right Flanks of the Troops of the Central Powers
in Dobrudja Have Been Defeated In Transylvania the
Rumanians on Both Sides of the Great Kukele River
Have Advanced Against the Teutonic Allies Northeast
of Lemberg, in Galicia' the Austro-Germans Have Been
Successful- News of the Fighting on the Macedonian
Front is Negligible On the French Front the Germans
Have Gained a Footing in Some Buildings in Eaucourt
1' Abbaye.
The Rumanians have invaded Bul
garia. On the upper reaches of the
Danube between the fortified towns of
Rustchuk and Turtukai, where the
river begin its bend northeastward,
leaving Bulgarian territory and sepa
rating Rumania proper from Dubrudja
the troops of Rumania have made
their way to the southern bank of the
stream.
Just how many men were thrown
across the river is not disclosed in
either the Rumanian or German official
communications, but the strategic
value of the manoeuvre seemingly is
two-fold.
Ninety miles eastward from Turtaki,
which lies at the western extremity of
southern Dobrudja, is Verna, Bul
garia's chief seaport on the Black Sea.
If sufficient men have been sent across
the river and are driven along the
Dobrudja frontier toward Verna r.ot
alone would the seaport be in danger
but the move would constitute a seri
ous menace toward the isolation of the
German, Bulgarian and Turkish forces
operating against the Rumanians to
the north.
Simultaneously with the announce
ment of the crossing: of the Danube
comes a report from Bucharest that
a fresh attack- along the entire front
in Dobrudja has resulted in the de
feat of the center and right flanks of
the troops of the central powers.
In Transylvania the Rumanians on
both sides of the Great Kukele River
have advanced against the Teutonic
allies, while westward in the vicinity of
Orzova and near Petrozeny, the Aus-trlan-Hungraians
have captured posi
tions from the Rumanians.

160,000,000 LOAN FOR RAILROAD
COMMUNICATION IN CHINA
Details Disclosed in Detail by Counsel
for the American Interests.
Washington, Oct. 2. Details of the
proposed new American $60,000,000
loan for railroad communication in
China, twice the size of any previous
similar loan and arranged with a view
to increasing the republic's total rail
road mileage by fifty per cent-, were
disclosed in detail here today by Da
vid S. Rose, counsel for the American
interests, after the publication of des
patches from Peking indicating con
clusion of the agreement. Mr. Rose
was present during most of the nego
tiations and drew up the contract
which now has been signed. Under
the agreement, Mr. Rose said, the
Siems-Carey company of St. Paul,
Minn., contracts (to construct as soon
as possible with money furnished by
the American international corpora
tion 1600 miles of railroad through the
richest sections of China and obtains
an optional contract to build another
1,500 miles later. China at prestnt
has but 6,000 miles in the whole em
pire. Estimating the cost per mile at
$40,000 completely equipped, the
Siems-Carey contract calls for an ex
penditure of $1)0,000,000 with the pos
sibility of doubling that amount ft the
option is taken up. The larsest previ
ous railroad line in China's history
was the Hukuang loan of 1911, by
German, British, French and Ameri
can bankers, totalling amout $30,000,
000. The loan is to be secured by the
property in the road itself and not by
concessions or government guarantees.
Surprise over the announcement of
such a tremendous project was ex
pressed here, for the recent failure of
a $30,000,000 loan to the Chinese gov
ernment because American financiers
could get better terms abroad seemed
to show apathy among bankers here
toward development in China. More
over, ever since President Wilson's an
nouncement at the beginning of his
administration that the terms of the
so-called six power loan jeopardized
the integrity of China, causing the
American group to retire, Chinese in
fluences have soifght in vain to float
a loan in the United States.
VILLA HAS NO ENMITY
TOWARD THE AMERICANS
Bandit So Informed Mexican Mining
Men at San Andres.
El Paso, Texas, Oct. 2. Villa told
the Mexican mining men at San An
drea, after capturing that town from
Carranza troops September 24, that he
had no enmity toward toe Americans
and asked them to notify their Ameri
can friends tc resume work at their
mines in eastern Chihuahua, as he
would give them all guarantees, two
Mexican mining men who arrived last
night from San Andres reported.
Villa, in an impassioned address to
the townspeople, declared he was
fighting "only the traitor Carranza,"
they said. He announced at Santa
Ysabel and San Andres that he would
return In a few days and any male
resident of these towns over the age
of 14 not ready to take up arms with
him would be put to death, the mining
men stated. Villa got 100 recruits at
these two villages before marching
toward CueihulriachjQ, they said
berg the stake, has resulted in suc
cesses for the Teutonic allies north
east of the Galician capital and for
the Russians in the southeast. On
the Brody-Zloehoff roads the Teutons
recaptured the ground lost last Sat
urday, according to both Berlin and
Vienna and made prisoner 2,30 Rus
sians, while in Narayuvka and Zlcta
Li pa sectors the Russians repulsed vi
cious attacks, inflicting heavy casual
ties and capturing 1,600 men. In the
Lutsk region of Volhynia northkest of
Sviniusky a Russian attack was re
pulsed. Ori the front in France the Germans
at Eaucourt 1' Abbaye in fierce fighting
regained a footing in some of the
buiidings of that town but west of
Gueudecourt and east of Courcelette
the British improved their positions.
On the part of the line held by the
French the men of General Foch made
progress east of Bouchavesnes and re
pulsed an attack south of the Somme
in the region of Vermandovillers. In
clement weather again has impeded the
the operations in the Somme region.
Little additional news of the fighting
on the Macedonian front has come to
hand. The troops of both sides along
the front apparently are continuing
their attacks and ounter attacks,
with n,o notable successes for either.
Aside from bombardments, which are
especially severe on the Carso plateau,
little fighting ia taking place on the
Austro-Italian front. One person was
killed and one injured, and light ma
terial damage resulted from the Zep
pelin raid over East England Sunday
night. The entire crew of the Zep
pe'in which was brought down in

today to the league's terms and would
have his full quantity regularly.

quart or more has been announced to
begin Dec. 1. The present price is
nine cents a quart. All dealers will
raise it. most of them to ten cents
