from the sales amounted to about
f.SOO. A lare part f- this wcM for
s oves and furniture which was brought
ia from tlio country. Hogs brought
a good price as did cattle and horses.
Smith and Wilson, the auctioneers,
deserve credit in a largo measure for
the success of the day, being good,
clean and energef'ic salesmen.
Money is Easy.
Yesterday was considered the most
satisfactory sales day in over a year.
Everybody seemed to be in a good hu
mor and they- came into town by
scores. The men brought money and
so did the women and $100 bills flash
ing at times from the purses of women

prevailing good prices. Hogs up,
broom corn up, cotton up, big prices
for cattle, there appeared to be little
room for pessimism among the coun
try folk.
This condition has already been re
flected in business circles on the occa
sion of National Pay-up Week. Bills
of long standing have been collected
and collections are bettor than for
months past.

question is expected to take place

8UY SEASON TICKETS
FOR LYCEUM COURSE
The college" girls are busy
selling tickets for the O. O. W.
!' euni course which will start
soon. A list of attractions of
the highest character is being
offered and the citizens of
Chickasha are asked to rally to
the assistance of the students
in carrying out this enterprise.
The price at which the season
tickets are sold by no means
represents the value of the en
tertainments, Everybody who
buys a ticket is assured to get
more than the worth of his
money. Don't waste any time
with argument when the girls
call nil you just buy a ticket
or two and send them sway
happy. That is one way to be
a good college booster.

Express :
Oklahoma City, October 2.
To the Citizens of Grady County:
You are to be congratulated upon
the display of the agricultural products
of Gtady county which was made at
the state fair by your worthy and effi
cient agent, Mr. O. C. Cooper. In my
udgmeut, Grady county had the best
exhibit displayed. While you did not.
take the first prize, 1 think it is just
to Mr. Cooper to say that a large num
ber of agents earn') to me alter the.
awards had been made and stated that
Grady county deserved belter rating
than she received. Two agents were
very insistent that the Grmly county
exhibit should go to the Dry Farming
Congress at El Patio, believing it
would take the first prize there. I am
not. partial when 1 say that a large
number' of people believed it to be tho
best display on exhibition.
I am acquainted, with all of the coun
ty agents of the state and I know that
no agent is more appreciated or stands
higher in the estimation of tho people
'.ban Mr. Cooper, Your president, Mr,
VV. E, Smith, gave him able assistance
and these gentlemen deserve a great
deal of consideration for what they
have been able to do.
In this connection let me say that to
the best of my information Mr. Smith
was the only exhibitor in the fair who
had competition in every entry and
won every first prize for which, lie con
tested. If these two gentleman return to the
Kingdom of Grady a little bit chesty,
be patient with them because there
have been enough nice things said to
them within the last ten days to cause
them to feel that they are just a little
bit superior.
With a deep interest In Grady coun
ty and her material as well as educa
tional development, 1 am.
Yours sincerely,
