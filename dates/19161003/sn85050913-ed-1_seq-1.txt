CHAN6E IN FOSTER
FURNITURE FIRM
Arch Foster Buys the Interest of His
Brother in Webster City
Store.
A change in the management of
the Foster Furniture Co. store is an
nounced, in which Arch Foster buys
out the interest of his brother, Will
A. Foster, in the furniture* and un
dertaking business.' The consumma
tion of the deal will take place No
vember 1st and at that time Will
Tester will remove to Algona, where
he has bought out a furniture and
undertaking establishment and will
assume the management of that.
The store in this city will probably
continue to do business under the
old name of Foster Furniture Com
pany, although this is not yet decid
ed.
Arch Foster came to this city to
embark in the furniture business
August 1, 1908. At that time the
store was owned by Arch Foster, T.
S. Curtis and Swan & Leytze of Inde
pendence. August 1, 1909, Mr. Cur
tis sold his Interest in the concern
to Will A. Foster, who came to this
city from Independence to make his
home here. Aug. 1, 1913, the Foster
brothers bought out the interest in
the business formerly owned by Swan
& Leytze and since that time have
been alone in the establishment.
Will Foster has bought out the
furniture stock of J. A. Steinberger
in Algona and will the first of No
vember move his family to that city,
renting or selling his Second street
residence here.
Webster City people will be sorry
to lose Mr. and Mrs. Will Foster, not
only from the business world, but
from church and social circles, in
which they have been prominent.
They will always' be assured of a
welcome. back, should they ever de
cide to return to this city to live.
Returned From Eldora.
Clarence Ludlow, a Webster City
boy who two or three years ago left
this city for Eldora to enter the State
Industrial school, has returned home
and began work this morning in the
Hahne printing establishment. Dur
ing his stay at the school he has con
tinued the work he was'engaged in
before—typesetting—and is capable
of making his way with a working
knowledge of this trade. Mr. Hahne
feels that boys handicapped in any
way should always be given a broad
chance, hence the position held by
Ludlow before his committment to
the school was waiting for him when
he returned.
More Men for Border.
From Des Monies comes the report
that seventy-three recruits taken in
to the Iowa National Guard during
the past several weeks will be taken
to the border the first of next week.
Adjutant General Logan, who is
much concerned over the refusal of
the government to permit the use of
barracks at Fort Des Moines for
quartering.the guard when it returns
from the border, has received no fur
ther word from the commanding of
ficers with regard to using the fort.

WHEN WILL THE IOWA
BOYS HOME?
The Question is Discussed' at Browns­
ville—Some Think They Will
Come Soon.
Brown8ville Sentinel, Sept. 2S.
Inquiries at the Iowa Brigade head
quarters yesterday failed to elicit
any- information as to any orders be
ing issued for the return home of
the troops from that state.
Lieutenant Park Findley, brigade
adjutant stated tfyat absolutely no
orders for the troops to prepare to
leave have been issued.
Among the men comprising the
brigade, however, the impression pre
vails that the troops will leave for
home In a few days. A sergeant in
one of the companies this afternoon
offered to bet a newspaper man ten
dollars that the Iowa troops would
be rolling north by Saturday of next
week. The sergeant, however, knew
that he was talking to a newspaper
man and that his money was safe.
The only tangible evidence that
the Iowa brigade may be moved is
contained in a letter from Camp
Dodge, the Iowa state mobilization
camp, which was received yesterday.
The letter states that the workmen
are placing the camp ground in con
dition for occupancy and that elec
tric light lines are being erected at
the camp occupied by the brigade
before it left for the border.
Prof. Mitchell to Lecture.
Prof. S. W. Mitchell of the Dun
combe schools will give an illustrat
ed lecture to the Juniors at tho Bap
tist church next Sunday afternoon. A
special program will be prepared and
older people are invited to attend
with the children.

MEEM CLOSED
Dr. Bruce Brown Speaks on Great
Question, "What Shall I do
With Jesus?"
The evangelistic meetings closed
at the Christian church Sunday ev
ening with an overflowing crowd,
many being turned away.
The interest was intense. Dr.
Brown spoke of tl|e great question
confronting every one—"What Shall
I do with Jesus, who is called
Christ?" A number have identified
themselves with the church and the
church has been greatly strengthen
ed. Mr. Brown is an eloquent speak
er and is always kind and consider
ate of others in his preaching. He
stands for the fundamental things
of the gospel, believing that it is im
possible to have a gospel morality
without first a recognition of gospel
authority.
His motto is "In essentials, unity
in opinions, liberty and in all
things, charity."
At the morning meeting Sunday
the church gave Dr. Brown a very
liberal offering for his services.
The evangelist said at the even
ing service that "This church was
never in better condition for a for
ward movement than now."
SHOULD RELEASE
STUDENT GUARDS
Gen. J. B. Lincoln Says Country's
Safety Does Not Depend on
Their Retention.
Ames, la., Sept. 30.—Students in
Iowa colleges who are members of
national guard units doing service
on the Mexican border should be al
lowed to return to their schools just
as much as the Illinois and Yale
units which were recalled some time
ago, is the opinion of Gen. James
Rush Lincoln, in charge of the ca
dets at Iowa State college.
General Lincoln declared that in
as much as units comprised entirely
of college men have been recalled by
the government, there is no reason
why students in other units should
not bo also recalled.
"A student looses one of the best
years of his life by being compelled
to drop his studies at a critical per
iod in his career," said General Lin
coln. "As far as the safety of the
country is concerned the few stu
dents who would be mustered out
would make hardly any appreciable
difference in the ranks."

MOTHER CISC OF

Louise Marvel, One! of the Twin
Daughters of Mr. and Mrs. C.
W. Marvel, Has It.
The health authorities were noti
fied yesterday of the existence of a
case of infantile paralysis in the C.
W. Marvel home on south Willson av
enue—little Louise, one of the six
year old twins of the family having
the disease in a moderate form. The
little one has been ill since Thurs
day with what seemed to be a cold
and sore throat. She seems better,
but one leg is slightly affected with
the paralysis.
The cohdition of Charles Baker,
the nine year old boy who is being
cared for at the detention hospital
at the county farm, is daily improv
ing. He is now sitting up and eat
ing heartily and is able to speak. Re
ports from him are very encourag

STORE
OPEN TO PUBLIC
Enormous Crowd Fills New Five and
Ten Cent Store Every Hour
of the Day.
The new Woolworth Five and Ten
Cent store in the former Orpheum
theater location, was thrown open
to the public Saturday morning at S
o'clock and a clerking force of twen
ty-four girls and women waited up
on the throng.
Asslstinjg L. P. Andrews, the man
ager of the Webster City store, were
Messrs. Dolllck, manager of the
South Omaha store Christopherson,
manager of the Omaha store Kirsch
ner, manager of the Waterloo store:
Mohlmann, manager of the Mar
shalltown store, and Mr. Sprague of
Chicago, superintendent of the
Woolworth stores throughout the
middle west.
These gentlemen have been in the
city for the past week, assisting in
the arrangement of the stock in the
store, and will remain until things
are smoothly in running order.
The store is as attractive as a brand
new Woolworth store can be—and
that is telling the whole story. As
bright with new paint and as shin
ing with nickle and many mirrors as
a new circus wagon, the Woolworth
store everywhere is good to look at.
Expanses of glass are used in caring
for the enormous stock of candies
and nuts handled by the concern,
and the clerks are attractively white
capped and aproned.
Everybody knows what is in a
Woolworth store hardware, kitchen
utensils, crockery, jewelry, pickles,
candy, brooms, toilet goods, station
ery—everything apparently, but a
gas stove. No Fords were observed
upon any of the counters, but there
may be some before the holidays.
HARRY Id. DATUM
HOME IS CONSUK
EOJjY FUMES
Besidence and Nearly all Contents
Burned in Sunday Afternoon
Fire.
A disastrous fire occurred Sun
day afternoon about 3 o'clock, when
the Harry M. Dayton home on south
Seneca street was totally destroyed
by flames. The family lost all their
clothes and bedding and practically
all of their household goods, only a
few pieces of furniture having been
saved.
How the fire started is not clear,
but probably from the kitchen stove,
which was situated in a small lean
to on the north side of the dwelling.
The lean-to was papered with tar pa
per, and there had been a hot fire in
the stove. The family were sitting
in their south living room at some
little distance from the leanto, so
did not smell the smoke until the en
tire roof was smoldering.
The house was really entirely
ablaze before the alarm was turned
in and an accident which happened
to the harness of the fire team fur
ther delayed the fire wagon until tho
house was almost consumed when
they finally reached the fire. Wagon
driver Frazier was away from the
fire station and in his absence, Adam
S. Holt drives the team. Mr. Holt
therefore drove the team and one of
the checks came unsnapped soon af
ter the team left the station, so that
the turn could not be made at Will
son avenue from where the alarm
was turned in. Tho horses ran
across the east bridge before they
could be stopped and the check
rein fixed. The accident is one
which might have happened to any
driver of the team.
After the firemen reached the
scene, their attention was devoted to
the saving of the two homes adjoin
ing the Dayton home on the north—
the home of F. M. Dingman and that
of Mrs. Maggie Woodall, and only
by extreme care and hard work were
those two houses saved from a simi
lar fate. A small shed upon the
Dayton lot was also consumed by the
flames.
Mrs. Sarah Canficld of Illinois,
who is staying with the Dayton fam
ily, lost nearly all her clothes in the
conflagration. Only a few which
were in a trunk were saved.
A subscription paper was started
during the fire and circulated by I.
J. Sayr among the enormous crowd
which had congregated, and the pa
per will be circulated further in the
business district. The Dayton fam
ily can ill afford to lose a home and
its contents at any season of the
year and just now with winter com
ing on the loss is particularly a se
vere one.
The insurance carried on the resi
dence was small.
The ladies aid society or the Uni
versalis! church will hold a food ex
change at the Palace meat market on
Saturday morning, beginning at 10
o'clock.
