. With three days to grind the pro
duction of Olaa Sugar Company . is
21,428 tons, for the 1916 crop. These
are the figures that were given mem
bers of the stock exchange this morn
ing. They were compiled as of Mon
day, and the grinding is to finish it
is expected Wednesday. Brokers es
timate that the extra grind from the
date of compilation of figures will add
about 300 tons" to the figures given
and that the final figures for the year
will be very close at 21,750 tons.
: Considerable Interest has attached
to the probable final figures of the
Olaa crop. There was a considerable
reduction from original figures ftnade
and then a further reduction of 500
tons in a still later estimate. The
figures gir,en above are somewhat in
excess of the last reduced estimate.
It Is further said among' the stock
brokers that the prices being obtained
for Olaa shipments are considerably
higher than the price upon which esti
mates of earnings have been . based
and : that therefore earnings will not
be affected to the extent that some
had feared. ;

Whether Gas Company is Sup-
plying .Street Illumination
n r is Point of Interest
When is a street light Hot a street
light? In an effort to solve this ques
tion for the public utilities commis
sion,' Senator James I. Coke, attor
ney, and Commissioner W. Tv Carden
have arranged to walk the downtown
streets tonight on, Journey cf lnvestl
gation. -:. . -v.S-r- ;.x ;: . , - ' . ' '.
Lights kept up by the Honolulu Gas
Company, Ltd, are to be the subject of
study, for' upon the decision of the
utilities commission may hinge ' the
question of whether or not the Gas
Company will be asked to furnish free
SO street lights for the city of Hono
lulu.; .c ,C ' - :-Hi rv
July or last year, acting as deputy, attorney-general;
he filed an opinion that
"if the company is engaged in fur
nishing illuminating; gas for lighting
sidewalks even though the light fur
nished te supplied from ' some other
contrivance rather , than a lamp post,
the company would, under the terms
of Section 908, Revised Laws of Ha
waii, be -liable to furnish free,- the
street lights provided for la Section
00S. " ? ' , ,
Commission Must Decide; A ?.;
At the conclusion of the opinion
Carden passed the "buck up to the
commission by stating that the ques
tion of whether the gas company is
thus engaged is for the commission it
self to decide. , '
Carden, at tho time of filing the op
inion, was not a member of the utili
ties commission.. He was acting then
In his office as . territorial ' attorney.
When the " question . came up for dis
cussion yesterday afternoon, however,
he expressed the belief that so long
as lights are outside of windows and
over - sidewalks they are lighting
streets, SrZ.'-t rfJ'-,
Chairman' Forbes had already Voic
ed the opinion In his report that these
lights are merely used, for advertising
purposes or for lighting .windows, and
as long as they are under . awnings
they are not street, lights. . ? -
Cokes LetteV la Read'
Attorney Coke's letter to the com
mission, which was read, at the meet
ing, referred to the opinion rendered
by Carden as deputy attorney-general,
and concluded:-;
"l beg to say that an opinion upon
this subject was rendered to 'your
commission on July 1, 1916, by W. T.
Carden; Esq, deputy attorney-general,
which opinion was approved by I. M.
Stalnback? Esq, attorney-general This
opinion construes the question of law
involved and of course leaves the ques
tion of fact involved to be determin
ed by the commission. "
"It appears from the freport before
me that the Gas Company is not light
ing the streets, roads, or other places
designated in Section 908 and defined
in the opinion of Mr. Carden. If I am
correct in assuming that your commis
sion so finds, then the liability to fur
nish free 50 street lights has not been
incurred by the Gas Company.
Coke Has Own Opinion
The contention of the company's at
torneys has been that- so . long as
lights are not on poles they are not
properly street lights. This conten
tion Is borne " out personally . by Sen
ator Coke. The section says In part:
"Said W. W. Dimond shall also have
the right to erect and maintain lamp
posts or other appliances for lighting
rtreets, roads, or other places and of
connecting the same with the supply
pipes: provided that such use of said
streets, roads, or other places shall
first be approved by said superinten
dent of public works: provided further,
that if said VV. W. Dimond shall manu
facture and supply illuminating gas,
as well as gas for fuel, and shall erect
lamp posts as. aforesaid, he shall, on
requisition of the superintendent of
public works, furnish free of cost gas
for 50 street lights and thereafter
shall ' each year furnish five more In
addition to the number furnished the
preceding year.' . ; ?
Coke bases his argument on the part

In the last-number he wrote an article

declaration was ; directed against the
Kaiser, the article contained a scur
rilious diatribe agJrinat Great Britain
for. "planning a tribunal such las sen
tenced to death Mary, Queen of Scots,
and "Joan of Arc." In two years of war,
continued the article, the British army
had advanced only Ja few 'hundred
yards, and the task of bringing in the
prisoner was therefore presumably; to
be imposed on Russian. 4
According to. Mr. Asquith, "head of

went onte "war was not to end when
the time came for Russia to conclude
an advantageous and honorable peace,

it being pointed out that the article
in effectadvocated a separate peace

resolved to send a deputation to Sir

meeting and of the overwhelming
mass of Russians.
