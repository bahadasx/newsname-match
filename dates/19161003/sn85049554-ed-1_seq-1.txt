Birmingham, England, 6ct, 3.—Vls
cdunt Bryce, former ambassador at
Washington, addressing the Congrega
tional union today, decried the spirit
of hate against the Germans and tha
talk of a lasting trade war. In conclu
sion he advocaated a league to re
strain aggression and compel arbitra
tion.
'If there Is to be u- recurrence of
wars, becoming more terrible with the
increasing advance of science," he said,
"we may well despair of the future."
Lord Bryce recalled that Premier As
qulth, Lord Grey and iMr. Balfour had
expressed energetically and sincerely
the need of such machinery and said
that several groups of thinkers were
working out the plans.
"To establish my machinery for pre
serving peace," continued Lord Bryce,
"would be Impossible without the co
operation of the neutral states and es
pecially the greatest of all the neutral
states. We have been waiting and
watching to see whether America would
depart from her old policy of complete
Isolation and bear her part in the ef
fort for securing a permanent alliance
for peace. An influential league for
that purpose has been formed there
and now two momentuous events have
happened on which 'I- dwell because
they have been, little noticed here.

were prepared to Join In any .feasible

War May Not Be in Vain.
"Our peojtle and the statesmen who
lead our people could have no greater
encouragement to address themselves
when the time comes to this enterprise
which, they have already announced to
be necessary. I ask your help to bring
the matter to the people to show them
how much we and every nation have to
gain by removing the terror of war
which so long has hung like a black
.cloud over Europe. The churches could
do no more truly christian work.
"Let not this war have been fought
in vain. Let us search for some

end this oldest and most terrible
scourge of mankind."

New York, Oot. 3.—Germany will bo
ready for any trade war her enemies
may wage against her at the conclus
ion of the war, says Gen. Hepry H.
Morgan, United States consul general
at Hamburg, who has Just returned
from his post. The general says Ger
many expects America to be her most
close associate In trade after t)ie war.
"Germany realizes that her trade
with the nations of the allies will be
subjected to greater restriction^" he
said. "Regardless of fellngs that may
have been engendered by the,war, Ger
many expects cordial trade relations
with the United States."
He said Germany had sent little
mon^y out of the country for war ex
pense, as compared to what the allies
has sent to America, snd that the Ger
man store of gold will have a tendency
to prevent any crippling of her ability
to meet England in her struggle for

Butter, eggs and cheese all are

"We would strike a bargain then he
would pull out an old leather pouch

tremendously rich.
"In later years I, as the neighbor
hood grocer, went to market carrying
a similar pouch and about the same
amount of money. Now, however, I
would need a potato sack, which I
should have, to carry on my shoulder,

New York, Oct. 3.—The Nerw York
state farmers tightened their grip on
the milk supply today and caused a
further reduction to the quantity
supplied to this city. The farmers are
holding back the products of their
dairies to. compel the distributors to
pay higher prices.
Reports from all parts of the state
tell of thousands of gallons of milk
spilled in the combats between dairy
men and employes of the distributers,
picketing of cross roads in dairy dis
tricts, farmers held up and beaten and
cheese makers taking the surplus of
milk.
Twentv deputies have been sworn In
In Dutchess county to prevent raids of
fanners upon their neighbors to com

This resulted In one man being severe

and dumping it In some places the
farmers are raising funds to build co
operative creameries.
