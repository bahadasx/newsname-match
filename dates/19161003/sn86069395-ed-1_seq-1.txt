BIGGER IS THE
RINGUNGSHOW
The Famous Brothers Have a
Gorgeous Spectacle and
Great Circus Program.
f
1 he world s ureatest shows came
once again in the Ringling Bros'. Cir
cus, that exhibited in Hopkinsville
Saturday afternoon and evening. The
show is all that their billing implies,
for it is undoubtedly the world's
greatest. Charles Ringling, of the
famous family, was with the show.
The perfomance opened with a gor
geous spectacle, "Cinderella, "the like
of which has not been seen in any cir
cus or theatre. With pageantry the
vogue this year the "Cinderella"
feature was more interesting. Hun
dreds of people and horses were used
all in gorgeous costuming and trap
pings that fairly dazzled in the big
spot lights, the electric feature being
noteworthy in itself. The good old
fairy story was enacted in detail in
fivo scenes on a high stage with full
setting of mammoth scenery and with
part or the action on the ground, un
derella herself, unci everything about
it was beautiful in every way.
The circus performance itself was
immense and introduced many new
and novel acts. The big concert band
was splendid. Among the feature acts
were the astonishing feats of little
Mile. Leitzel on the rings high up in
the air; the riding of the Lloyds, the
Roeneys, McCree-Davenports, the
Zingaro Gypsies, the Greens and oth
ers. Alf Loyal, with his riding and
somersaulting Russian poodles, was a
big feature in itself. Wonderful was
the acts of Johnnes Jossefson, the
giant athlete from Iceland. His de
monstrations of self-defense against
three men attacking him was marvel
ous, as was also a like',exhibition by a
troupe of Japs in jiu-jitsu. The Chinks
hanging by their hair, the three
groups of flying ladies, the Nelsons
and Ernie Clarke in aerial acts were
all wonderful in their death defying
feats. The elephants were all train
ed to a nicety in new stunts, the
specialty acts in which high-perch
balancing and like stunts were shown
held the attention.
Arabs, pony, dog and monkey acts,
and wire acts, all entertained and
thrilled. J. Mijares, the world's fam
ous slack wire artist, was one of the
big hits oflhe program.
The afternoon crowd almost filled
the 16,000 capacity tent and the night
crowd was about half as large. Tho
show must have been seen by 20,000
people in this city. The weather was
tine and nothing disturbed the good
order of the day.
