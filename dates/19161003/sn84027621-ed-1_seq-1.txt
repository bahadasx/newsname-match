EVERYBODY MUST FIGHT
THE BOLL WEEVIL
Indications point to a large acreage
of cotton next year. This will be in
duced by the prospect of high prices.
However, the increased acreage will
avail little if something is not done to
control the boll weevil. Experience
has demonstrated again and again that
the boll weevils will destroy a large
proportion of the crop the second year
after they enter new territory. By the
third year the damage reaches disas
trous proportions.
According to E. S. Pace, district
aarent for the University of Florida
Extension Division, the spread of the
insect and the damage from it may
ba greatly curtailed by the destruc
tion of cotton stalks arly in the fall.
This procedure will not be so effective
for a single farmer, but a number of
farmers can do good work by co
operating. It would be advisable to
obtain action from all farmers in a
neighborhood. If the stalks are de
stroyed during the first days of Oc
tober it is probable that the damage
next year would be greatly lessened.
The crop is infested each year from
the weevils that live over winter.
Those weevils depend on the stalks
that are left standing after the crop is
picked for food until frost. If this
food is destroyed, only a small per
centage of the adults will live till frost
when they go into winter quarters.
