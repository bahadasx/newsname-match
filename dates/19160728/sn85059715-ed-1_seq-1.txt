ithnatcs very conservatively that

exists in every county of West

Trachoma is a contagious disease of|
te eyelids, spread by the indiscrimiate
use of towels, very slow and
sinful in its development and ending
t total blindness. In seriousness and
stringing results this disease far exseds
Infantile paralysis- In the marelous

to say there has been a large increase
in the membership with the
female classes slightly in tho lead
and a probability of the males having
to put up for the cost of the out-i

examined 350 people finding 350 positively
infected with trachoma. Many
small communities in this state would
show almost as heavy a degree of infection.
Recently a boy was found who
had been blind for ten years from
trachoma, spending seven of those long
years in a school for the blind, ilo was I
operated upon and after treatment for
two months was able to sec to read.
A married woman with a family had
been blind since her babyhood. She
had never seen her husband or her
babies. An operation in one of the
trachoma hospitals opened her eyes
to vision to her family and to a new,
world. Similar wonders arc being ac-,
coinplishcd almost daily by these sur-f
gcons whfj are fighting trachoma. i
Within the last six months 309 cases,
of trachoma wore rcportca irom seven i
counties to the state department ofi
health. A newly discovered widespread
outbreak was recently reported
from a northern county. The department
of health is endeavoring to get
all cases of this destructive disease
found reported cured. The cure is a
simple operation which, however, can
be done only by a competent surgeon.
The United States Public Health Service
maintains a hospital at Welch,
where cases of trachoma are given
free treatmentv.

Ins up" if you are "behind with your
hauling" as the Allssourlans say. No
matter how you have stood in the
past there is still time for you to go
out and secure enough business to
lift yourself over the heads of the
other workers and make a place for
yourself at the top among the winners
or tho automobiles and pianos.
It's a bard game for some to play,
this catching up, but It's easy enough
for the candidate with energy and
ambition.
The Closing Rules.
1. All reserve votes must be
polled in the ballot box at the Telegram
office In order to be counted
for the awards.
2. All subscriptions and reserve
votes must be In the Telegram office
by ten o'clock Saturday night, July
29. Doors will be closed at that
hour and only those who are inside
the office at that time will be allowed
to turn in votes and subscriptions after
that hour.
3. All votes and subscriptions
muBt bear a special delivery stamp
If mailed after noon, Friday, July 28.
Subscriptions received by mall later
than the closing hour will not be
counted.
4. No personal checks will be accepted
In payment tor subscriptions
on the closing night. Remittance for
-.wrintione must be In cash, money
order, cashier check, or draft. If the
club members will remember this
rule there will be no disappointments, ffi
Please do not present personal checks K
on the closing sight.
6. No vote ballots will be Issnod , >
without the name of the club mem
ber for whom they are to be voted '
appearing thereon. Any vote ballots
marred or defacod in any way will be
thrown out of the count
6. All subscription orders must J
be filled out with the correot name
and addresses of subscribers when
turned in. No money will be accepted
or votes Issued for any money
that is not accompanied with sub- .
scrlption orders giving full address of
subscribers,- ' '
two nign power umuuu iu-v;iui?si
automobiles down to pianos, diamondB,
etc., has created unprecedented
interest in the campaign both
among the actual workers themselves
and the general public. Everywhere
in Clarksburg, as well as in all the
surrounding towns, the question
"who will be the winners?" is the
question of the hour. The answer depends
In nearly every case upon the
effort put forth between now and the
close. Never before in any of the
Telegram's previous campaigns have
candidates run so close, or proved so
nearly equal in their popularity and
ability to secure votes. A single
subscription may decide the Issue
when the Judges make the final
count. No one can tell. But it will
pay every worker in the raoe to have
in several subscriptions too many
rather than one too few. Remember
this
the dig special vote unci m iv?w
week Is a forceful reason why each
and every candidate should keep on
hustling right up until the last minute.
Now Is the time to do your "caloh- i
