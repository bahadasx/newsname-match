THE MELTING POT
STRONGEST
OF THEJ5HAUTAUQUA
The Chautauqua program has been
so uniformly good that patrons had
grown to expect excellencies from the
producers, but even in face of this
fact, the immense house was not pre
pared for the masterpiece as present
ed in "The Melting Pot" Tuesday
evening.
With all of the pent-up fires of
souls who have touched hand with
life's real tragedies, their words ring
ing true and ppnetrating like those
whose natures have been seared in
the white heat of disillusionment, the
actors laid bare the intent of the
writer, and at no one instant was the
house out of touch with the play.
Such a blending of aspiration,
visioning, hopefulness and prayer,
backgrounded against realities as
startlingly cruel as pen, or the mind
may make them, will perhaps never
be presented. The story is one writ
ten by Israel Zangwill, and is replete
with a tingling of life-touch, riveting
the spectator to the facts inescapable,
Truly have advance and publicity
men said that "The Melting Pot" is
presented by an all-star cast. Nothing
could hnve been truer. There is not
a weak member in the cast, neither is
there a feeble line in the play. It is
a strong place for strong actors, and
no mistake has been made in the dis
tribution of the parts.
Its penetrative qualities pronounced
and the lessons intended to be con
veyed may not be overlooked by the
most indifferent. The production wa3
more than acting merely; it was the
delivery of a startling message in a
most extraordinary way. Those who
failed to see "The Melting Pot" were
unfortunate.
Generally speaking the Chautau
qua was a success both financially and
as a week of high class entertain
ment. The entire week was a rainy
one, but there was a good attendance
each day both afternoon and evening.
Mercer Hempcrlcy for Representative
The 'first person on the democratic
side of the fence to announce his
name as a candidate for the nomina
tion for state representative, one of
the most important offices to be filled
in Coconino county is Mercer Hemper
ley. Mr. Hemperley is a native of Mis
sissippi, a state that is considered
rather democratic in its political ten
dencies, in fact almost exclusively so.
'He was a student of the Louisiana
state university and admitted to the
bar in 1912, coming to Arizona a
short time later where he was con
nected with the office of C. B. Wilson
being admitted to the Arizona bar in
1914 and starting into practice for
himself in Flagstaff. He was city at
torney for one term and has built up
a commendable practice of law for
himself.
Believing that a lawyer is best
Adaptable to the work of legislating,
where many technical questions arc
constantly coming up for immediate
settlement by the legislative body, he
announced his candidacy for the place.
He announces that if elected he will
endeavor to give his best efforts in
securing uniform legislation and laws
that will be enforceable. He favors
the office of public defender duly
elected, who will defend cases brought
by persons unable to pay attorney
fees, rather than the present system
of appointing by the court in each in-
. dividual case as it arises.
Up to the present time he has no
,' opposition for the place and has every
reason to believe he will be the nomi
nee with the hope that a' strenuous
campaign will bring about hia ele:

Will Rudd has disposed of his
bunch of cattle, range rights and
ranches to Babbitt Bros. The cattle
ranged in the Ft. Valley country and
north during the summer and in the
Grand Canyon country .during the
winter months. The amount paid for

a good sized tunch of stuff and Iocat-

Flagstaff Wallops Williams
In spite of the rain last Sunday the
' Flagstaff Grays beat the team from
Williams at the -old sport of playing
ball. The Grays say the reason they
beat, the Williams boys was because
the Williams boys had on new suits
and didn't want to spoil them. The

MEXICAN SHOOTING AFFRAY
AT WILLIAMS SUNDAY
Williams was the scene of a rapid
fire shooting scrape last Sunday
night, but luckily murder was not
done, not, however without good in
tentions on the part of the shooters.
As near as can be ascertained there
was a Mexican dance where an alter
cation occurred and there was wrank
ing in the hearts of the contestants.
Later at night when the dance was
over a couple of the participants, sec
ured some heavy artillery and thus
prepared, went to seek the opposirig
parties.
Down the street they met a bunch
of compadries and asked for the ones
they were looking for; those address
ed did not know where they were.
With this answer the attacking party
pulled their guns with the remark;
"We'll see if there is a man here," and
commenced shooting. The result of
their gunfire were narrow escapes for
two of the crowd. One received a
gouge over the eye with a bullet that
cut across the corner of his forehead,
glancing on his skull bone, another
shot cut across the chest of another
member of the party, going in from
the left and skinning across his wish
bone and coming out at the other side
without more than a flesh wound.
The parties doing the shooting were
apprehended after the shooting and
held for legal action.
Yesterday County Attorney Wilson,
Undersheriff F. L. Dickinson and Tom
Eakins went to the scene of action to
hold a preliminary hearing as to the
cause of the shooting.
While the evident intentions of the
shooting party were good, luckily no
casualties resulted from their effort.
No report of the preliminary trial has
been received, but in all probability
shooting party will be held over in
bail for a diagnosis of their case in a
legal sense.
WOULD ORGANIZE COUNTY
CHAMBER OF COMMERCE
Mr. Frederic Price Comfort is mak
ing a canvass of the county in the in
terest of a county wide Chamber of
Commerce and has enlisted the suport
of many of the prominent business
men of Flagstaff, Williams and other
points in the county in the movement.
Mr. Comfort has a complete plan
laid out for the organization of such
a body with special committees to
handle seperatc divisions of the work
of boosting the county at large.
Whether the new Chamber of Com
merce is eventunlly brought into be
ing rests with the business men and
others in the county. The benefit to
be derived from a good live Chamber
of Commerce is unquestionable, but
it needs the hearty support of the
members in carrying on the work.
The Coconino County Chamber of
Commerce was organized July 25th,
191C, and a genpal meeting will be
called in the near future to consider
matters of importance to the residents
of Coconino county. It is proposed to
hold meetings alternately in Flagstaff
and Williams. The organization ap
pears to be meeting with excellent
support.
J. D. Dunn Candidate for Assessor
J. D. Dunn the present county
assessor is out for the nomination
this year on the democratic ticket for
re-election.
The many intricate mysteries of the
tax laws of the state make it neces
sary for one to be thoroughly, or at
least very well acquainted with their
complexities, in order to handle the
work of that office.
The friends of Mr. Dunn believe
that he made good in handling the
work for the past two years in the in
terest of the people at large And
should be given another term in that
office.
Having been born and raised down
in the alligator country he naturally
trends toward democracy and uses it
consistently,, though he has come to
believe in Inter years that there are
even a lot of republicans who can
consistently claim to being human.
Mr. Dunn promises his best efforts
in handling the affairs of the office
the coming year with justicp to all
property owners, treating each and
every taxpayer with fairness, as he
has done during the past two years.
New Dentist for Flagstaff
Dr. J, C. O'Connell, formerly of
Phoenix has decided to locate in Flag
staff if it is possible for him to secure
quarters for an office. Dr. O'Connell
has been in Flagstaff for several days
looking over the situation and condi
tions seem to appeal to him, with the
result that he proposes to become a
permanent resident of the city,

POST TRADER KILLED AT HOUGK
STATION BY GOWBOY
Leonard Oleson, the post trader at
Houck station Apache county, was
shot and killed Wednesday by Fay
Sheek, a cowboy employed by the
Bennitt & Small Cattle company.
Houck station is a small trading,
post near Holbrook, just across the
line in Apache county.
So far as can be learned the shoot
ing was the result of previous trouble
between the two men which had its
origin some months before. The
trouble was renewed Wednesday
when Sheek drew his gun and shot
Oleson six times, killing him almost
instantly.
Oleson was a large man and said to
have been unduly aggresive; Sheek
LUCKY TERMINATION OF A
'MOST EXCITING RUNAWAY
There was a rapid scatterment of
people, wagon and horses last Friday
noon at the corner of San Francisco
street and Railroad avenue, when a
team belonging to J. B. Clark started
something all their own. He had just
dumped a load of dirt for street fill
ing when something happened to one
of the teams great displeasure nnd he
turned his rear artillery lose in vol
leys, then started to move out of the
picture. The team swung around,
narrowly missing the fated lampost,
but plunged into some soft cement
that E. B. Raudebaugh had just fin
ished laying at that corner, bumping
the tongue of the wagon into the brick
corner with force enough to break it
in two, then swung back with the
wagon rambling back and forwards
across the road until they attempted
to make a turn north of Railroad
avenue; there they took a small
chunk off the corner of a house and
were captured a short distance up the
street.

to the time they started on their ownl,, turnw, Wm fa on thc mar.

unable to keep his vantage point in
the wagon when it started on its wog
gling swish around the corner and
picked out a clean place on the new
pavement to pile his personality
rather than attempt any watchful
waiting, for in his estimation, not I
counting in factors of equilibrium,
there was a tempestious tournament
ahead.
As soon as he realized that he had
really stopped, he commenced again,
using his own momentum, directing
his course so as to reach the high
geared team in the shortest possible
time. Luckily, Clark did not bust
any of his machinery or have a blow
out when he smeared himself on the
street. The team, however, only
missed by a small .margin of going
through the plate glass window and
playing billiards with Andy Jones'
pool hall.
There were a good many people on
the corner and most of them were
playing checkers with themselves in
order not to take up any space or
roadway the horses desired to use.
M. A. Murphy for Justice
Mr. M. A. Murphy, the indefatig
able worker during the Elks' celebra
tion, has anounced himself as a can
didate for thc nomination on the dem
ocratic ticket for the office of Justice
of the Peace for this precinct and will
be an active candidate for that office.
Mr. Murphy was the democratic
nominee for the office of Clerk of the
Superior Court two years ago and is
a consistent democrat witn many
friends on both sides of the political
fence.
He is asking for the support of his
friends for that office, believing that
he can bring to it the necessary quali
fications to deal out justice, in what
ever manner it may arise to the satis
faction of those who believe in exact
justice, rather than mere law or fav
oritism. Mr. Murphy is a property owner of
Flagstaff, a permanent resident and
one who thoroughly believes in the
growing city of Flagstaff. He has no
friends to reward and no enemies to
punish if elected to that important
office.
He would greatly appreciate the
support of the people of this justice
precinct in electing him to that im
portant office and is sincere in his be
lief that he could do justice to all,
regardless of their political beliefs.

COUNCILMAN FINLEY GETS
IN FOR ONLY AN EIGHTH
Councilman Sam Finley was caused
to advance with careful tread yester
day morning in to the sanctum san
torium of the Police Judge for the
purpose of ascertaining whether or
not his automobile, of the Studcbakcr
breed, was capable of making more
than fifteen miles per hour within the
precincts of Flagstaff. The speed
cop, who docs not seem to be ac
quainted with anyone, averred that
Sam's Studenflicker was going at the
rate of eighteen miles per hour when
he gathered the data on the Council
man. Councilman Sam was demon
strating the machine at the time to
one who desired to purchase it, and
he declares the proposed purchaser
told him that he wasn't in the market
for a. mudturtle and that he could buy
a snale contraption more cheaper
down the road. With this, Sam kicked
a small contrivance to see if his "Old
Maria" would answer, and for twen
ty feet it ran at the rate of 15
miles per hour. The speed cop, know
ing that Sam had helped make the
gin.
Sam, when called in to see his ex
ecutioner, entered his plea, something
like this: "Well, you see, judge, it
was necessary for me to get some
competent evidence to show the man
I was showing the car to, that it
could run 15 miles per hour. While
in my own mind I am some sceptical
about it even yet, but if it is the judg
ment of this court that "Old Maria"
will go better than that, it is worth
more than that amount to me in sell
ing the car. Here's your $10 yellow
back just to show that I believe the
city has a right to set a speedometer
to regulate speed, whether it is by
booze, gasoline or arcoplanes."
With this cool statement from Sam,
George Reynolds remarked that since
there was no speed arrangement on
the machine he was using, he would
be cquallylis magnanimous, regard
less of the short-change speedomitcr
the cop seems to have been using.
Many friends came to see Judge
Layton at about that same hour yes
terday, bringing along a subdued
whinner, but neither of the "speed
fiends" gave them an opportunity to
"horse laugh 'em.'
SANTA FE TO START
NEW TICKET SYSTEM
A new, system of handling passen
ger tickets by the Santa Fe company
will go into effect on August 1st,
owing to the recent order and opinion
of the Arizona Corporation Commis
sion in the matter of three cent rate
investigation now pending, for all
business within the state of Arizona.
All agents will be supplied with
special card, simplex and coupon tick
ets which are to be sold after August
1st. The coupon of the ticket will be
detached and held as a receipt for
money paid and if the order of the
Corporation Commission eventually
stands, and the rate of 3 cents per
mile becomes operative, the coupon
will be good for a return of the ex
cess amount paid by the holder. The
receipt coupon is not good on trains
for fare and must be signed and re
tained by the purchaser until a final
decision has been rendered; if a three
cent fare is ordered, they are "worth
the difference, if not they are worth
less. Democratic Club Meeting
The Democratic Club of Coconino
county will have a meeting at the
court house on Friday evening July
28th at 8 p. m. All Democrats please
be present.

ALL INJIRCUS PARADE.
There was a gigantic, spectacular
parade, gorgeous in its magnificent
splendor, which included its monstros
ities gathered from the extreme ends
of the confines of the magnificent city
of Flagstaff, gabbalooks, galla-wal-lopers,
pink giraffs, humming birds
with tusks, gobblins, elephantecs,
wooffs-wooffs, whangadoodles, the
sacred neckless turkey, with dressing
to match; pingpoodles, automobillious
bugs, also a snoot-snout group, a
patchwawallager with a thousand
eyes, or freckless, or something like
that; beautiful ladies, whose ages can
safely be exposed for years; lamp
.blacked ladies with sunlight complex
ions, whose ages have about reached
the beau-tide, and so on, and so on,
made up the "Ringless Circus" of the
children's parade ,for the Tuesday
morning joy-day of the big Chautau
qua. The "circus," eliminating the P. T.
Barnum method of post-poster lang
uage, was one of the most amusing
and entertaining parades that has
been seen in Flagstaff since a string
of cowpunchers rode a bunch of bur
ros, and it attracted large crowds
along the streets to see thc little folks
and their immitations of the gob-goblins
and animals of a "real circus par
ade." Thc children's circus was put on
under the ausipecs of the Chautauqua
by the children of Flagstaff for thc
benefit of the Flagstaff "Playground"
movement and held at the Chautauqua
tent at 10:30 just after the parade.
Everything that a big circus puts
up to attract a crowd was represent
ed or misrepresented, just as it struck
the visitor, by the great, long galaxy
of actors, burro riders and burlap an
imals. The parade and the circus was im
mensely enjoyed by a large crowd of
people and the little folks in their
characters as different kinds of circus
folks were well worth twice the price
of admission.
The morning entertainment netted
over ?40 which will be turned over to
a local committee for a playground
fund.
HENRY D. ROSS FOR JUDGE
OF SUPREME COURT
Chief Justice, Henry D. Ross, of
Prescott, arrived in Flagstaff lost
week and has been lining things up
for rcnomination to the office of Judge
of the Supreme court. Mr. Ross is well
known in Flagstaff, having located
here when he came to Arizona in
1886. He taught school and practiced
law in Flagstaff and was elected coun
ty" sttorney soon after the county of
Coconino was organized.
Three judges were elected at the
last election, Mr. Ross being one of
them, and tl.eJr terms were to be two,
four and six years respectively. The
men elected drew lots for the terms,
and, although Mr. Ross had the high
est vote, he drew the short term of
two years.
Hereafter one judge will be elected
every two years and his term will be
for six years. Mr. Ross is seeking
the nomination on the democratic
ticket, but upon securing the nomina
tion his name will be placed on the
general election ballot atthe top with
the names of other nominated candi
dates without party designations, as
the law provides. He is asking for
the votes of the people on the record
he has made in office.
Some More Good Improvements
Alf Dickinson is very much a boost
er for street improvements and has
started the game on E. Railroad ave
nue along in front of the Pine hotel,
which he promises to make a real
hotel as fast as he can build up. That
particular block, with no walks has
been' more or less of an eye sore be
cause of the lack of cement walks and
grades. This is being remedied and
the tourists first glimpse of the city
as he comes in from the east will
give him a much better opinion of the
town when the work has been com
pleted, aside from the added 25 to
the value of the property. Located
as prominently as it is, it really
should be paved. In any event the
present work will be of great scenic
value.
Governor Meets Governor
Governor Hunt arrived in Flagstaff
on Sunday evening to receive Govern-,
or R. B. Glenn, of North Carolina, in
to the state of Arizona.
Governor Glenn arrived in Flagstaff
during the afternoon, scheduled to
dplivpr n. lMt.nr nt tho (Tiontniiniin
in the evening. As an especial mark
of attention the governor of Arizona
was present to greet him.
REPUBLICANS ROLD
BIG LOVE FEAST AT
There was an enthusiastic gather
ing of republicans at the county con
vention held at the court house last
Saturday afternoon, with a represent
ative number from the different pre
cincts over the county.
There was little they could do in a
definite way in putting up a ticket,
but there were many good sugges
tions made for the coming campaign
and plans were laid for one of the real
old time methods of doing things with
all hands interested in the game.
The convention was organized by
the election of F. S. Breen as chair
man and T. H. Cureton of Williams
as secretary.
The report of the committee on cre
dentials showed a good representation
present, especially from Williams,
where eight Selegatcs were present
out of ten they were entitled to.
The following resolution was pres
ented and unanimously adopted:
Be it Resolved by the Republicans
of Coconino county, in convention
assembled, that we most heartily en
dorse the action of the Chicago con
vention in nominating Charles E.
Hughes for thc presidency and Char
les W. Fairbanks for vice-president
and hereby pledge our loyal support
for their election.
Resolved, that the democratic ad
ministration, both state and national
has been highly detrimental to the
best interests of the people and that
this convention call upon all good citi
zens to unite in securing an adminis
tration in the interest of the public
at large;
That we recommend all thc officers
who have enforced the laws and fur
ther recommend that our laws be
either enforced or repealed and not
be -subjected to the whims of any.
particular faction or person."
The convention was addressed by
Thos. Maddock, chairman of the state
central committee, who took occasion
to remind those present that it was
a republican year and conditions were
never more favorable than at present
to sweep the state.
Owing to having been elected state
chairman, Mr. Maddock tendered his
resignation as county chairman, which
was followed by the resignation of
Secretary Crable, because of his can
didacy for thc nomination for county
attorney.
The vacancies were filled by the
election of Fred W. Smith as chair
man, and G. T. Wall as secretary of
the central committee.
The question of securing republican
registration officers for Flagstaff and
Williams came up and a committee
was appointed to wait on the County
Recorder to ascertain whether he
would appoint any officers other than
the democrats now doing that work.
Candidates Discussed
There were many new names dis-
cussed for places on the ticket, aside
from the ones who have already an
nounced themselves as candidates. No
action could be taken since it is neces
sary to go to the primary in any
event Among the many discussed
were the following:
State Senate M. J. Riordan, E. H.
Crabb, H. J. Gray.
Legislature T. H. Cureton, Charles
Larson. ,
Supervisors F. S. Herr, B. A.
Cameron, W. A. Campbell, George T.
Herrington, W. M. Rudd.
County Attorney C. B. Wilson and
Francis D. Crable.
County Treasurer Leo F. Ver
kamp, Charles Button of Williams,
Fred Garing.
County Recorder Judge R. J.
Kidd, Albert Dennis, R. A. Morse,
John Zalaha.
County Supt of Schools Mrs.
Bertha Kennedy, Mrs. Alex A. John
ston, Mrs. E. E. Rosenbcrry.
County Assessor Jerry Lee, Ben
Pearce, both of Williams, F. 0. Allen.
Sheriff J. O. Harrington.
It is a splendid list to pick from
and thc voters will have little diffi
culty in making a good selection.
To Organize Republican Club
At the conclusion of the convention
proper, the Flagstaff delegates start
ed a movement to immediately start
the organization of a republican club
on the plan of the Williams club,
which now has a hundred members or
more who arc doing good work for
the good of the cause. A special meet
ing will soon be called by the com
mittee to start the organization on
the way. . ', '- a ,
