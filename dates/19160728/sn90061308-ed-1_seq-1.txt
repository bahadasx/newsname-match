REMEMBER
In selecting a candidate for Attor
ney General, it is well for the country
voters to remember that St. Louis is
making a persistent fight to have the
State Board of Equalization raise the
assessed value of farm lands and
country real estate generally,; to its
actual cash value. This means tnai
th valuation of real estate in the
country Would be treble or quadrupled
and the taxea raised in the same pro
portion, 'The Attorney General is a
member of the State Board of Equali
zation, and Frank W, McAllister, of
Monroe County, has lived in the coun
try all' his life, is in sympathy ,wi.th
the country people and can be depend
ed upon to oppose the efforts of St.
Louis raise the taxes of the country
people, to the bitter end. Both of his
opponents. are from the city of St.
Louis. The Nevada Daily-Mail.-. s

STATES ROAD FUND
Missouri

and
v Washington, July 26. As the first
step in the federal government's part
of spending 150 million dollars on
good roads in the next five years in
co-operation with the 'states, Secretary
Houston announced today the appor
tionment of federal funds for this year
A circular will also be sent to all the
governors and state highway authori
ties outlining a tentative plan of pro
cedure, V The 150 million dollars is to be paid
half by the government and half by
the several states, apportioned among
the latter according to their respec
tive area,1 population and rural mail
route mileage.
5 The expenditures are authorized by
the Shackleford-Bankhead Good Roads
Law, the first granting federal aid to
states in road building. Actual con
struction of some of the roads may
begin this fall and extensive construc
tion next spring is planned.
Appropriations for the present year,
enking July 1, 1917, authorized by
Congress, are 5 million dollars. For
the four succeeding years they are
respectively, 10 million dollars, 15
million dollars, 20 million dollars and
25 million dollars. The law provides
however, that ho government money
shall be available unless the states
spend an equal amount, matching tl
government contributions . dollar for
dollar.
Every cent of the federal and state
funds, the act provides, shall be spent
to build new roads . Maintenance costs
thereafter must be borne by the states
alone
Rules apd regulations to put the.
Federal Aid Law, as it is popularly
known, into prompt operation are now
being drafted by the Secretary of Ag
riculture, upon whom devolves practi
cally the entire work of supervising
the government expenditures Imme
diate supervision will be by the office
of public roads and rural engineering,
of which
rector.

Waller Page is di-
The apportionments of this year's 5
million dollar appropriation, less 3
per cent for administrative expenses,
with those of other years in propor
tion, include:
Arkansas, $82,689; Colorado, $83,
690; Iowa, $146,175; Kansas, $143,207;
Missouri, $169,720; Nebraska, $106,
770; Oklahoma, $115,139; Texas,
$291,927. j
The first installment is for the fiscal (
year ending June 30, 1917.
Routes and construction materials
of the new roads are to be finally de
termined by the Secretary of Agricu
ture.j No pubic road can be built un
der the law until its location, cost and
character are approved by him. Every
road project, with plans, specifications
and cost estimates must be given his
approval before any of the federal
money shall be available. The roads
must be "substantial in character."
A limit of $10,000 per mile, however, is
the maximum fixed by the law to pre
vent use of the government funds in
building costly boulevards which
would not assist in rural development .
. Whether the new roads built under
the law shall be main traveled trunk
lines, connecting interstate highways,
or merely small sections scattered
throughout' the state is also left to the
discretion of the Secretary of Agricul
ture. Construction of both is ex
pected. Tennis oxfords, white pumps, and
