l flroecles. Tex., July, 28. An Amer
ican army of fifty thousand, including
regiments from New York, Illinois,
Virginia, Iowa, Dakota, Indiana and
Nebraska, lies as helpless in the lower
Kio Grande valley as an angleworm in
a jug of molasses.
I rode fifty miles along the Rio
Grande.' The folly of equipping our

fashion and not. having European
s roads is seen at. every half mile. A
rain such as today's would make no
difficulties on any European front but
it almost paralyzed the Amorfcan'forc

By C. W. Ackermann,

With the German army before Ver
dun, .July 28. Germany's maslerv
here has robbed the French of their
greatest chance to co-operate in the
allied drive. If the French positions
had not been tinder attack by the Ger
mans, they could have hammered
here simultaneously with the British
hrust. But the Germans now domi
nate the city and German officers say
the main thing now is not whether
Germany takes Verdun but that the
! Teutons remain masters of the battle
field. j "French bravery is what, prevented
, the Germans from capturing the city,"
said one German staff officer today.

Verden and made a half dozen seiz
ures of whiskey and beer, which ap
parently were not intended for the
use of the people to whom they were
consigned. Among the names of con
signees was that of E. T. Nye. Upon
inquiry I learned that an elderly wo
man of Chickasha running a small bu
lno88 hero had been receiving con
signments under this name. Imme
diately after the seizure the train pull
ed in and the woman alighted. 'There
Is the lady who Is receiving the goods'
said the agent. I waited to see how
she would act upon learning the"
goods had been confiscated. She lean
ed over and spoke to the agent in a
low voice. He replied 'That liquor
will be in Chickasha before von are.
jThe sheriff has just, taken it' After
alighting from the train she had en
gaged a service car man to bring the
liquor to her place in Chickashs,
"Every day between now and elec
tion day," continued the county attor
ney, "we shall keep a s-tet lookout

"In the first place Herrera Is not
his name. His real name Is Abi-im
Barrios and he Is from Texas, He Is
a bad man and had I not mado a raaid
escape he would have killed we alfi,
although I have never had aiy wordf
with him. There are Beverat factn
connected with the affair whicH go to
show that he was not too drunk either
to think or to run at the time, of tho
murder but that this Is only a 'shrewd
play to escape justice. Lejsn than
three minutes before the murder of
Lopez, Herrera, as he calls (himself,
came Into my store and myj brother
by mistake gave him a xikan ttatf
dollar-Instead of an American' lialf.

asking my brother to send him on
American coin instead. If iio had been
drunk as he says he was (ie could not
have remembered that my tirother had
given him a Mexican coin When T
asked him what he had doi, as Lopez
lay on the ground, he replied that he
would fix me In the same -way. Then
he grabbed the idstol f mm Tmi'
hand and with both t)Mol and knife
started for me on. a run 'at! 1 had to

COULDN'T STAND "MULE CURE"
After three successive days with th
eagle and the mule cures, 3. A. Jack
son, the incorrigible city prisoner who
refused to work and was turned over
to the county, has given in and prom
ised to be good if the guard would
detach him from the nn.lo. Walking
behind a plow all day Is not as easy
job as men on the county roads of
ten encounter, even when the driver
holds the reigns and commands tin
mule to go and stop to his. tileasurM
But to be handcuffed to that animal
and subject to his sudden starts and
stops is an entirely different matter
and yesterday afternoon after trying
it out for two days Jatkson called
County Commissioner Jita Hobiuson
and told him if he would separate him
