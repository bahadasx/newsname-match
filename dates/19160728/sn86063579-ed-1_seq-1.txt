BCPPUE8 ARRIVE
As a consequence of it nil about
3,0(10 num of the national guard arc
to be mobilised hern this week. On
that point there can he no doubt. The
first evidence was the opening of the
quartermaster' headquarters and the
unloading of carload after carload of
supplies. The next evidence was the
coming of n nuijor surgeon of the
medical corps with assistants and the
commencement of n hospital building
which, when completed, will care for
1,000 inmates.
THREE REGIMENTS ON WAY
But if other evidence was lacking it
was supplied yesterday by the arriv
al of a train loaded with big niotm
truck, tlurly-tbreenf litem, and tit
ty men in charge of them. Three reg
iments inf national guardsmen are on
the way, and others are entraining.
There will be ull of 8,000 guardsmen
officers' and others attached to the
service.
MEANS MIVH FINANCIALLY
Financially, this means much to
Deming. Only 5,000 men encamped
at Fort Hli's meant much to El Paso,
o busy city of 75,000. How much
more 8,000 men means to Deming, a
little city of 5,000, is hard to esti
mate. But it mchns nil oulluy by the
guardsmen and I'ncle Sam at least
fU2."i,OIMl.OO a month.
PURE AIR AND WATER
The hospital is to be more than
merely a hospital for the forces sta
tioned here. The sick men from be
low the border, from Douglus and No
gales in Arizona, from Columbus, and
some of them-from El Paso, probably
are to be sent here to reeiiicrute. The
water is pure, the nir cooler there is
less dut and and.
'00.00" BECOMES FAMOUS
' Deming put itself on the map n fet,
years ago, hv advertising its water as
99.00 pure. Willard Holt, the veteran
edilui' of the Gruluc, sililled HH.S)il
as a slogan and the postoftlce here
unhesitatingly places in his box nil
letters addressed to 09.09. No other
address is required to insure delivery.
For four years, that other veteran
editor, Mi'. Vallandigham, of the
llendlq.'ht, hits also boosted with all
the powers that an Mssililo for a
wide-awuko energetic able news

MADE UP OF BOOSTERS
(If coarse, there were, and are, oth.
er boosters in plenty. The town is
made up of them. Any one who is not
a booster gets so lonesome here that
he generally moves . on, and men
who get tired of boosting, who wear
out boosting, also move on. But the
boosters who never tire, or wear out,
stay here and keep on boosting; and
