To The Republicans And Voters
Of The 7th, Appellate District.
In order that the voters and
Republicans of this district may
be correctly informed of the po
litical situation in respect to the
Appellate Judges race, and that
the public may not be misled as
to the true situation as far as
Judge II. C. Faulkner's candi
dacy is concerned in Perry
county, will say that the entire
Republican organization of the
county is against him and the
Republican party as a whole are
against him, and I am sure that
he will not be able to poll more
than 200 or 300 votes in the en
tire county, for the reason that
the Republicans of Perry county
have called upon him on differ
ent occasions to come to their
aid and he has always refused to
give the republican party his
support and has in truth and in
fact fought and opposed the re
publican party ever since he has
been in Perry county, and the
republicans of Perry county for
these reasons are against hira

Dear Judge:
I am at l.ee City building some

would be for Kirk but since I
have seen and talked with a
great many people in Wolfe and
Morgan counties I have decided
to be for you. There will be a
Such enthusiasm has seldom been
seen in an election in this part of
the country. S impson's friends
claim they will give him the
votes in this end of the distaict
by enormous and unusual ma
jorities in every county in this
great Cumberland Valley section.
The people have profited by the
lesson learned in the defeat of
Edwin P. Morrow for governor
and are rallying one and all to
the support of their champion.
That Sampson is a winner they
are practically sure, but will not
let over-confidence keep them
from the polls on August 5th.

Dear Sir;
It gives me great pleasure to
recommend to the voters of the
Seventh Appellate district, the
Hon. Flem D. Sampson for Ap
pellate Judge, I feel sure he is
the only man in this end of the
district that can, and will win.
, There is no doubt but that he
will carry Owsley county by at
least JHlfl votesi, and is gaining
stivngth every day.

FIRST ON BALLOT.
To the Voters:
Judge Sampson has made a'
splendid fight. He will win a
great victory for the peoDle at
the polls on next Saturday. I
have made a very thorough and i
conservative estimate of his I
strength in the district. He will ,
carry the big Republican count-1
ies in his own Circuit Court Dis
trict almost solidly. He will get
an enormous vote of the RffiV
licans of the 11th co. gre. .uil
district. He will carry some of
the counties in the Kentucky
river section, and wili get a large
vote in many other counties. He ,
will get as large scattering vote '
all over the Appellate district as i

Barbourvilie, Ky.
The Appellate Judge's race in
Laurel county is becoming more
interesting every day. A large
number of the voters of this
county who have previously been
indifferently are now rallying to
the support of Judge Sampson.
They say they are for Judge
Sampson because he has proved
himself to be a friend to the
common people. He made a
speech at London a few days
ago and a large majority of the
people seemed to be for him and
many of them pledced him
their support and at cross roads J
where he made a speech to a
large crowd of voters a standing
vote was taken and every man
was for Judge Sampson. He is
going to carry Laurel county by
a nice majority,

any other candidate running.
His nomination is assured.
I wish however to warn Judge
Sampson's friend? against 11th
hour campaign lies. iiit ene
mies lied when they told that he
would not be on the ballot. His
name appears first on the ballot
among the candidates running
for Judge. Any stories circula
ted now at this late hour, reflect
ing upon Judge Sampson or his
canuidacy, are told with the de
liberate intention of deceiving
voters.
Beware of any such falsehoods
which may be started and rally
to his support at the polls.

LIE NAILED.
Secretary of State, the Hon.
James P. Lewis, has certified the
ballots for the August Primary
and the ballots have been print
ed accordingly in all the counties
of the 7th Appellate district.
The Secretary of State holds
that Judge Sampson's filing of
expense account was a substan
tial compliance with the law.
Judge Sampson's enemies knew
it was a lie when they circulated
all over the district that he had
not filed his expense account.
But they know also the only
hopes they have of defeating
Sampson was to get his name off
the ballot or deceive the voters
by their malicious falsehoods.
An exact copy of the Republi
can ballot appears on another
page in this issue.
