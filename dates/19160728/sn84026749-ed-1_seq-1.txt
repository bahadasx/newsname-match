An Official Declares That She
Is Not Lost Until "Three or
Four Weeks."
DEUTSCHLAND AT MOORINGS
Watchers on Submarine Are
Waiting for Departure of
, British Steamers.
BALTIMORE, July 28. Watch
ers aboard the German subsea
freighter Deutschland want to see
the ships of England go.
They fear that a plan is afoot to
have vessels in ballast in the har
bor follow the Deutschland out to
the capes and "accidentally" ram
her. This would save the allied
patrol a big task, and, as one of
the Germans put it, the Britisher
could say, "Oh, I beg pardon; I
will pay you damages."
This fear is believed to be one
of the compelling, motives behind
orders to delay the Deutschland's
departure.
DISCREDIT REPORT.
The Bremen, however, I- a' vital fao
tor. Storlei that ahe has been cap
tured, ana Id now Interned at Halifax.
Nova Scotia, brought the comment from
a Deutschland official today:
"Bah. she la not lott until three V
four weeks. And, he added that the
Deutschland' slster-shlp la too clever
to fall Into the meahea of the allied
patrol.

tion for the Otean Rhederel. only laugh

All W8B peaceful along tho Patapsco
early today. A persistent screen of
mystery still haunted the situation.
There had been a lone party aboard the
Nrckar at the Deutschland pier; some
of the crew had Individual parties
nshorr. railing In during tho early
hours.
But no one connected with tho sub
sea venture would reveal when tho
. Drutechland'n stay endB. Tho forty
eipht houra since the Deutschland clear
ed, expired this afternoon, but under
local 'port rulea It waa found that the
vessel need not re-clear, aa supposed,
except In case ahe alters her cargo.
The vessel Is still being trimmed aa there
Is a certain unevenew that might be
annoying later.
The Deutschland prepared today to
take on a pilot from the Maryland Pi
lots' Association, but that organiza
tion said Owen Coleman, who brought
her up river, waa out of town and not
immediately available for service.
While Capt. Zack Culllson, of the tug
Tlmmlns, wants Coleman, the rules of
the association require that vessels take
"the first man out," the first man on
the pilot list.
A twenty-four hour crew la aboard
the Tlmmlns, giving the Impression that
the stay of the Deutschland Is not long
and that when she does head out she
may plan a lay-over In the lower bay
before trying to run the allied patrol.
Unequal Trimming Feared.
A fear of unequal trimming of the
ship has held up the sailing of the
Deutschland.
This Is believed to have caused the
xVinnire of the sailing time. It waa re
ilnhlv reported that the submersible waa
scheduled to leave "some time after
midnight" Wednesday.
The decision about the sailing time
had been reached Wednesday after
noon, following the submergence teat

Sheppard Quits Fight to
Make D.C pry This Year
Senator Sheppard of Texas, lead
er of the prohibition forces, an
nounced today his definite de
cision not to push "dry" legis
late at this session.
Hope of obtaining action on a
national prohibition I amend
ment was given up several
weeks ago, but dry leaders had
counted on being able to at
tach a dry "rider" to the Dis
trict of Columbia appropriation'
bill.
Adverse parliamentary rulings,
however to the effect that
general legislation could not be,
included in an appropriation
bill convinced Sheppard, he
said today, it .would be useless
to press such action this summer.

iJ.NDON, Juy . British troops have
driven the Brandenourgars out of Del
villo Wood, according tu Uenerml Half a
report to the war office today.
The UrlUsh commander-ln-chler aaia
the Fifth Brandenburses vere the eUr-
man troops thus ejected from the little
foresuc arv:i nurtawcM of Loitgt -vol,
which haa been the seen of hand-to-
hand fighting for the paat week.
"One hundred and abcty-three prison-
era were captured In Delvllle Wood, the
whole ot which la now ours," uenesal
Molg reported, "iwo Uii.-nan counter
attacks, were beaten off with heavy loss
to the enemy."

"Further, progress", at Longeuval waa
announced hr UieBrtttsb commander-in-chief,

"small portions of Germans entered
dur front trenches at two points, but
were Immediately driven out by a
counter-attack, leaving their wounded,"
Northeast of Souchex and t'sewhere
Halg reported arttlledy combats.
Until today, British troops fighting to
push through the Pozleres sector, have
been thrusting uphill. Today they have
the advantage of fighting iiom above
on an enemy below on lower ground.
They have the added advantage of at
tacking an enemy ur.alded by natural
cover, and now ousted from the perm
anent, ntrel and concrete constructed
trenches perfected In the long months
of the deadlock In the line.
Faced Disadvantages.
Foremost among the disadvantage of
General Hale's position waa tho fact
that the Kaiser Is ranking superhuman
efforts to stem any further break In
his lines. Reserves have been stripped
from all along the remainder of tho
German front, to be maaaed against
the British, or used In desperate counter-attack.
Special dispatches from , Verdun say,
the German attack there has waned
Into a mere ordinary assault. Instead of
the holocaust of flame from artllleiy
with which the French fortress has
been deluged during tho last six
months, with practically no concerted
Infantry attacks. ... ,, .
Experts here agree that the Xalscr
will make desperate attempts In con
certed counter-attacks to win back the
ground wrung-jnch by Inch almost

advance very much farther along the
road from Poileres to uapaume Dy inc

BOMBSHELL FOR SENATORS
Members Expected Move to
Abolish Preterit Government
to. Go Out on Technicality.
Vice President Marshall threw a
bomb into the Senate today by de
daring in order an amendment jto
the District appropriation bill, of
fered by Senator Works, abolish
ing the government Of the District
and placing the conduct of its af
fairs directly in the National Gov
ernment. Senator John Walter Smith, in
charge of the bill, raised the point
of order against Senator Works'
amendment that it was new and
general legislation on an appropri
ation bill.
Vice President Marshall in
overruling the point- of order, took
the position that the District of
Columbia is not a municipal cor
poration, but that its government
is a mere bureau or agency .of the
General Government, and, that the
amendment of Senator Works
dcaiing-with ttje conduct- 6fW af
fairs' of the District wasentitledttf
consideration. ' '
WbRKS FIGHTS HARD; '
Senator Works had spoken at length
In support Of his amendment. Ha had
held the floor for about three hours.
Senator Smith Indicated at the butset of
his remarks that he would raise a point
of order against the amendment.
He withheld his point of order until
Senator Works had completed his.
speech, It had been generally supposed'
by Senators that the chair would rule
the amendment out of order and tkus
dispose ot It.
But to the surprise of everyone Vice
Pcsldent Marshall held that Senator
Smith's point waa not well taken.
"I assume thero will be an appeal
from the decision of the Chair," said
the Vice President.
Senator Galllnger, who hod argued
briefly that the District waa a muni
cipal corporation and that to change
the form of Its government .would be
general legislation, urged, after the
ruling by the chair, that no appeal be
taken but, that a voto bo had on the
merits of the axoendmont Itself.
Stands for Half-and-Half.
In making his point of order Senator
John Walter Smith, In a brief but vigor
ous speech, upheld the half-and-haU
system. Ho declared It was working
no Injustice to anyono, that he could
seo no reason for haato In getting rid
of it, and that the question of Its aboli
tion should be carefully considered, and
In some other fashion than on an ap
propriation measure.
Following the ruling of the Vice
President that the Works amendment
was In order, discussion proceeded on
the merits of the Works plan. Senator
Martlnc took the floor and upheld the
holf-and-half system.

face to face with the question or

vote is taken the Works amendment
will be defeated. Indications are that
the half and halt system will be sus
tained.
Works Starts Debate.
Protracted discussion of the half-and-half
question and of tne government of
the District was started when Senator
Works presented his amendment for the
abolition of the District government.
Under this amendment, the District
government would be eliminated. Tho
affairs now conducted by It would pass
to the-National Government and the ter
ritory Included In the District would be
governed directly by the National Gov
ernment.
The District, under this plan, would be
known and designated as the City ot
Washington, and bo the Capital of the
United Btates under the direct owner
ship, control and supervision of the
Government of tho United States with
out the Intervention of any municipal
body or corporation.
Senator's Own Views.
Senator Wdrks presented the amend
ment as an expression of his own views
on what should be done to settle for
ever the half-and-half controversy and
other problems relating to the District
govornment.
Ho gave notice, too, that If this
amendment went out on a point of or
