Experts.
Washington, july 28.—A "Bermuda
high" is the official cause of the worst
heat wave that has enveloped the
country in fifteen years. Translated
from the cryptic language of the
weather. experts, that means a great
I area of high' pressure air has been
(mobilising on the weather drill
gr&un&s ih the Atlantic off Bermuda
far the last month and now has let
go the full power of its offensive from
the seaboard to the Rocky mountains.
For weeks it has stood like a solid
wall against heated currents trying
vainly to move out from the interior
oyer the ocean and now as it swirls
rapidly along it is gathering heat and
moisture from the tropics and sweep
ing them northward over the conti
nent into the vacuum of so-oalled "low
pressure areas." Although Its greatest
Intensity has not yet struck the Pact
ifle coast, it is expected to do so with
'In the next few days.
No relief is promised from the phe
nomena which in the east has caused
sweltering city dwellers to light fires
In their homes to dry out the hu
midity, or which in the Mississippi
valley Is threatening to destroy mil
lions of dollars worth of food crops.
Chief Forecaster Frankenfield said
yesterday that the. heat wave only
had begun. It is certain to continue
"through the week and probably long
er. None of the conditions essential
to a break-up are yet evident. Tbe
I relief- which often comes from the
northwest Is nowhere in sight.

Grain Not
liniJisnlii*d
So the Grand Forks fair has no ex
hibit which lays special emphasis up
on the raising of small grains. They
are at best merely given a place in
carefully worked out plana of crop
rotation. But when it comes to cat
tle, sheep and hogs, there Is a lesson
for the farmer on every corner.
Probably no exhibit on the grounds
so well illustrates the value of stock
raising as that of tbe agricultural col
lege. Particular mention should be
made of the several pens of bogs, in
connection with which are exhibited
placards showing the amount of vari
ous kinds of feed fed the animals in
fattening them. There Is a lesson of
tremendous Importance In the mere
statement that hoga will gain a pound
of weight per 2.6 to 3.94 pounds of
grains or forage fed them, ft requires
no extensive computation to show
that It pays to sell farm crops indi
rectly by first converting them into
bacon or the like.

The exhibits of cattle are among
the best to be seen anywhere. No

Washington, July 28.—Increases of
five cents net per ton in freight rates
on bituminous coal carloads from
Illinois and Indiana mines to points
from those states and Wisconsin and
Michigan were found justified today
by the interstate commerce commis
sion. It is estimated the Increases
will add $520,000 yearly to the rev
enues of the carriers.
The railroads contended that under
the old rates bituminous coal did not
bear a proper proportion of the op
eration cost nor yield a fair return
on the railroad Investments.
CANADIAN LOANS
MOVED TO AMERICA
New York, July 28.—There are in
dications of an early shifting of west
ern Canadian loans from London to
this market, though hardly on the
broad scale suggested in recent dis
patches from Winnipeg. It Is known
that prominent bankers are willing
to make the loan of $8,000,000 to
Manitoba and $2,000,000 to Sas
katchewan, with probably $2,000,000
to Winnipeg, the proceeds of which,
to such extent as may be necessary,
will be used to take up the issues of
the two provinces and the city of
Winnipeg now handled In London.
If these offerings go well, the New
Tork bankers probably would in
crease the amounts stated, but it is
an open question as to how much
of the outstanding debt now held
abroad can be secured. A part of the
obligations of Manitoba could not be
handled here, partly for legal rea
sons and In other, instances because

AH exposition snch as the Grand
Forks Fair is a great clearing house
for information. And whatever may
be said of the entertainment features,
the things which really last are the
ones which Instruct and teach. Any
one making a round of the different
exhibits on the grounds is impressed,
with the fact that for the farmer

bull—an animal so large that oha

Anitfial." At the boys' encampment
*he youngsters are having dally talks.
Farm Machinery.
Many machinee and implements of
practical usefulness, if not )ndespensi
blllty, to the stock raiser are on dis
play on the grounds. Several silos ara
shown and are the object of much
Interest among farmers. Then there
are ensilage cutters with blower or
conveyor attachments which, for sim
plicity of construction and operation,
are among the best on the market.
Dairy Products.
The dairy end of stock raising Is
amply taken care of by displays of
cream separators, milk clariflers,
milking machinee and churns. The
farmer who wishes to compare the
merits of tbe different makes of cream
separators, can find all of the princi
pal makes In the Liberal Arts and
Machinery buildings. The milk clari
fying machines are among the first
seen here. This machine removes all
dirt and all foreign matter from milk
and a very large part of the bacterial
content.
Aid to Farmers.
The exposition offers many sugges
tions to the farmer who w.ithes. to
ease the labor of the farm household.
Prominent among these exhibits are
thoee which show the application of
electricity in the home. Two large
concerns show electricity producin'g
units. These machines produce elec
tricity which can be taken directly
from the generator or from the stor
age batteries which act as a reposi
tory of the surplus energy. They are
self regulating to an extent which
makes their operation by inexperi
enced persons a matter of ease. With
electricity on the farm, the North
Dakota farmer has a convenience
which will do much to bring most of
the city comforts easily within reach.

Lausanne, Switzerland, via Paris,
July 28.—A strong protest against the

and Austria has been made by the
Lausanne Gazette. The Gazette says
the blacklist Is now being drawn up
by a Captain Schmlts at Berne under
the direction of the commercial at
taches of the German and Austrian!
legations.
According to the paper all Swiss
firms known or suspected of doingj
business with the allies are not onlyi
deprived of coal and other German
products, but are boycotted by other
Swiss firms. The boycott is enforced
by threats that any firm will be black
listed which deals with concerns ob-|
