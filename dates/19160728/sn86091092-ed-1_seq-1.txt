THE CALDWELL TRIBUNE, FRIDAY, JULY 28, 1916.
WEEKLY, $2.00 PER YEAR
GRUM FAVORS BUILDING
NORTH AND SOUTH
WAGON ROAD
Geo. E. Crum of Lewiston, Idaho,
Republican candidate for nomination
for governor, was in Caldwell a few
hours last Friday. Mr. Crum spoke
with confidence regarding his out
look for the nomination. He stated
that if he is nominated north Idaho
will give him several thousand ma.
jority in the general election which
would assure beyond any doubt
his election. He will carry not only
the normal Republican vote of North
Idaho, but will make big inroads into
the Democratic vote as well. He also
feels that he will carry the normal
Republican in the south in the gen
eral election, plus some gains from
the democratic ranks, thus assuring his
election, if nominated, by a large ma
jority.
iMr. Crum came through from
Lewiston by auto over the proposed
r oute of the north and south highway,
via Whitébird, Riggins and New
Meadows. He is very enthusiastic
about the construction of this high
way. In discussing this he> made the
following statement:
"The distance from Grangeville to
New Meadows is approximately 90
miles. Probably 40 miles of this
distance a good highway could be
constructed with comparatively little
expense. With the opportunity now
for federal aid the cost of the state
and counties will be materially less
ened.
Federal Aid
"Under the federal aid bill, which
became a law July 11, congress ap
propriated $75,000,000 for road con
struction to be expended within a
period of five years with a like amount
to be raised by the state. Idaho's
portion of this federal c---oprlation
during the next five years is $941,
250 and is available as follows:
1917 $ 62,750
1918 125,500
191 9 188,250
1920 251,000 .
1921 313,750
Total $941,250
"This money is to be used under
co-operative arrangements with the
state highway department.
"In addition to this congress also
appropriated $10,000,000 to be expend
ed for roads and trails within or ad
jacent to the national forests on
basis of a million dollars annually for
ten years. On account of a large
portion of Idaho being situated with
in the national forests, her proportion
of this fund will be an item of great
importance to the state. This act
of congress appropriating $85,000,000
for road construction in conjunction
with the state is an advance step in
federal road legislation and gives a
definite plan to road construction not
only to the state but also based upon
a comprehensive national system.
Approximate Cost
"E. M. Booth, state highway engi
neer, gives approximate estimates of
the cost of this highway which
amounts to $240,410 from New Mead
ows to Grangeville plus five per cent
for engineering and ten per cent for
contingencies. Of course a portion
of this cost would be borne by the
counties through which the highway
passes The undeveloped and sparse
ly settled region along the Salmon
river would require state aid in the
construction of this road. With the
federal aid available for fifty per cent
of the construction there is no reason
why this north and south highway
should not have sufficient state aid
to complete at an early date.
"The importance of this highway
cannot be overestimated. It is a piat
ter of interest not only to the north
ern and southwestern parts of Idaho,
but also to the entire state. It would
open up the now inaccessible and un
developed region along the Salmon
river and Idaho and Adams counties
would aord direct transportation nortli
and south. At the present time the
only transportation north and soutli
is by circuitous route through Wash
ington and Oregon, which makes
north aiid south Idaho as remote
from each other as Idaho is from
Colorado.
"In my opinion there would be a
tremendous traffic over this highway
once completed, and in addition to
the commercial benefits it would bring
north and south Idaho into more in
timate and closer relations. This high
way also would afford the opportunity
for east bound auto tourists from the
coast through Spokane to come south
through north Idaho and over this
north and south highway, thence
eastward through south Idaho and vice
versa, and thereby travel the entire
distance north and south and east
and west through Idaho.
"There are no more attractive and
delightful spots fo r summer resorts
than in Idaho. This highway would
also make accessible the beautiful
summer resorts of north and south
Idaho, making it possible for Idaho
people to enjoy the delights of its
own beautiful lakes and mountains,
instead of seeking comfort and rest
in much less attractive points on the
coast.
"No better investment can be made
in any community than in good, per
manent highways. Every producer
and citizen becomes a beneficiary, and
in my opinion there is no highway of
so much importance and benefU to
the entire state as this proposed high
way directly connecting the north and
south."
Mr. Crum has some very decided
and lias some very decided and empha
tic opinions as to the manner in which
the business of the state of Idaho
should be handled. He says> there is
no difference in principle in public
and private business, and there should
be no difference in the method of its
transaction. In commenting on this
he said:
"We can legislate around the land
board and change its personnel from
now until doomsday, but we will not
remedy the existing evils. The sys
tem is wrong and will require a consti
tutional amendment before a proper
method of handling the business can
be had. It is impossible for members
of the state land board to handle sat
isfactorily the tremendous volume of
business coming before them in the
necessarily haphazard manner in
which it now has to be handled. Only
a very small portion of the time of
the members of the land board can
be devoted to the business of the
board. Every member is also a mem
ber of numerous other boards, each
of wheih requires more or less time
and consideration.
"The business of the state land
board should be handled through
non-partisan board with a responsible
head, the members and officials of
which would devote all their time to
the consideration and transaction of
the large and increasing volume of
business of the board. At present the
responsibility of the board is divided
among five members. One member
is no more responsible than another.
No hundred million dollar private in
stitution can be successfully managed
with the responsibility divided in this
manner, neither can a similar institu
tion like the state land board be suc
cessfully managed cxccpt through a
definitely responsible head, and the
devotion of all of the time and atten
tion of those in charge of it to its
business.
"If it requires a constitutional
amendment as it does to remedy the
evils of the present system and place
the business of the land board upon a
substantial business basis, why not
adopt it? There is no other remedy
which will effect a permanent cure."
CUPP SAYS RE
CRUITS ARE NEEDED
Captain Cupp lias been at Nampa
this week and is here now. He will
be in Nampa again Saturday and ex
pects to visit Payette, Emmett and
Weiser next week and will be in
Caldwell again Monday August 7,
"Traders Diy".
Under oraers from the War De
partment, Captain Max B. Garber, U.
S. Army Mustering Officer at Boise,
mustered into the United States ser
vice Captain S. W. Sponey, Walter R
Cupp and First Lieutenant Hal Shat
tuck.
Under orders from Major General
Bell, commanding the western divis
ion, these officers have taken up their
work.
Active recruiting for the National
Guard in Federal service has been
launched throughout the state. First
Lieutenant Shattuck has the northern
part of the state with headquarters at
Coeur d' Alene; Captain Sponey has
the southern part with headquarters at
Pocatella and W. R. Cupp has the cen
tral part with Caldwell or Boise as
headquarters. A recruiting office will
be open regularly in Boise cither on
Main street or in the State House.
Captain Cupp is quoted as follows:
"The recruiting is done now under
Federal authority, by virtue of the
joint resolution adopted July 1, 1910
declaring an "emergency". The recruits
if accepted go into the United States
service with the National Guard at
once and will serve during the 'emer
gency' after which they will be re
turned home.
"All recruits from this section will
be rendezvoused at Boise for examin
ation and enlistment,
"When enlisted they will be sent to
Fort Douglass, Salt Lake, Utah, where
they will be equipped and instructed
for a short time when they will be
sent on to their companies with the
regiment on the border.
"Will there be any lighting in Mex
ico? Well, that depends upon the back
ers of Mexico. Mexico is getting ready
to light us, she needs time to get
some supplies on credit given her for
that purpose from outside sources.
'If we show strength then backers
might withhold support and war
might be delayed, but from the show
ing we have made thus far in the call
for volunteers, we are but coaxing
the Mexicans on, and reports and let
ters from there show they are losing
no time getting ready to fight us.
"There certainly will 'be some fight
ing, as to how much no one can tell
at present. There will probably be no
fighting of consequence until after the
rainy season has past. That will be
about September 5th. And they may
delay for months if the leaders can
control the situation."
BOY DROWNED IN INDIAN
CREEK
Tuesday afternoon Howard Fritz,
express agent at the O. S. L. depot,
was drowned in Indian creek. Howard
and five other boys were in swimming
near the point where the Oregon
Short Line crosses the creek. He got
into the swift water, was drawn under
and drowned. Attempts were made
to resucitate the boy but without
the 8-year-old son o L Orvllle Fri£|
C. A. Dailey was in the city from
Greenleaf Wednesday.
CITIZENS OF CALDWELL
mom RENDER
HRIRtHl MR
Thirty-two public spirited citizens
of Caldwell and vicinity responded to
the plea for a permanent fund for the
families of members of Company G.,
the total amount subscribed being ap
proximately $25.00 monthly. The re
sponse of the public to the request has
not been as general as was expected,
due largely perhaps to mis-apprehen
sion existing regarding the expendi
ture of the money raised.
The money subscribed by Caldwell
people will be administered by a com
mittee of five, Messrs. W. P. Lyon; E.
H. Plowhead,Fritz Miller and Mes
dames E. L. Brvan and L. W. Botkin,
and will be used primarilyin assisting
dependents of men now with the com
pany at the tjorder. No part of the
money will be used to provide for the
officers or enlisted men, but will be ex
pended for their benefit as the sound
business judgment of the disbursing
committee dictates.
The government has made no pro
vision for the assistance of members
of families whose bread winners re
sponded to their country's call and
that duty will necessarily devolve upon
the community. The pay of enlisted
men is $16.00 monthly scarcely enough
to meet incidental expenses of the
men at the front, and leaving nothing
for the support of the families.
The subscription blank is published
elsewhere in this issue. Fill it out
while you have it in mind and mail to
First National Bank, Commercial Na
tonal Bank. Western National Bank
or the Caldwell Commercial club. The
amounts already pledged vary from 25
cents to one dollar per month. Surely
vou, whether businessman, clerk
farmer can afford to contribute a small
amount for the welfare of the loved
ones of those who are serving their
country and are making It possible for
you to live in peace and prosperity.
The subscriptions received up to
Tuesdav follows. A complete list of
'subscribers will be published again
next week.

SOLDIERS COMPLAIN OF
FOOD FURNISHED BY
GOVERNMENT
a
What of the quality and quantity of
food that is being furnished the mem
bers of the National Guard at No
gales. Arizona? That is the question
that the people of Caldwell are patting
at each other every day. The govern
ment says that the food is ample in
every respect. Officers have been pro
hibited from soliciting donations from
the public for the purpose of buying
more or better food. Members of the
company have written their home
folks both criticizing and commend
ing the food supply.
The Tribune was informed Wednes
day by a man who has a son in Com
pany G., that the son writes that every
thing is fine and that the boys are in
need of nothing.
The Other Side
The Tribune is in receipt of a let
ter dated July 20th from a member of
Company G. which says in part:
"The rainy season hit here the same
time as we did and so that at least
is one thing to be thankful for. But
take it from me, between rains it is
something fierce—the told sky-light
and machine is an ice-box along side
of this.
"We're sure drilling a heap—reveille
until retreat—and what rookies: we
have are coming to the front» in fine
shape.
"There is quite a little kick about
our grub which is sure government
straight and short at that—We have
no mess fund, at least there appears to
be none (several claim money was do
nated, etc.), but as it is we get no
vegetables at all and if the meat is
spoiled we have no fund to send it to
El Paso for a fresh supply. That is
where we have to get vegetables, etc.
also, you see whefle we stand with no
fund for that purpose. We are not ask
ing for any steady donation under
stand—if we could get $300 or $400
in our mess fund we would haviik a
basis to work on and eventually save
on the government straight and get
ahead. As it is it is the worst prop
osition I've ever been mixed up in
and I've seen things pretty bad. We
can live on what we got, but if some
the tender kids go under with
diahorrea (?) or dysentary you will
understand how it started—If they do
not get enough to eat in the company
the devil himself can't stop them from
goitïg to town at night and swill up
on dirty sandwitches, ice cream, soda
pop and Lord knows what not,
how it is made, and that is exactly
where all these dreaded tropical dis
eases originate. So if Caldwell people
want there own boys to keep on top
of the ground they had better come
across a bit—I'm not kicking for my
self because I understand the game
and know about just how far to pull
up my belt. But they all haven't the
sense to pattern after an old timer.
"Outside of the foregoing. Co. G.,
is the bestest little outfit on the border
and she will sure do her duty when the
time comes—We're all willing to learn
and no growls come when an unpleas
ant task comes up. We've got a dandy
camp on a side hill ,and get the
breezes if there are any..
"Will drop you another letter in the
future, but this time I'll make a noise
like a clam."

GOVERNOR HAINES IN CITY
Former Governor John M. Haines
was in the City from Boise a few
hours yesterday. Mr. Haines is not
in politics at the present time. He has
been urged to be a candidate this year
but could not do so. His friends ex.
pect him to get into the game again
some day.
RONDS OF DIS1RIGT
SHOULD BE FUNDED
As stated in the last issue of The
Tribune there will be a special elec
tion in the Pioneer Irrigation District
for the purpose of voting upon the
issuance of the bonds of the district.
The election will be held Monday,
August 28th. At this election two
propositions will be submitted to the
people of the district, viz.; the au
thorization of the bonds of the district
in the sum of $78,980,00 for the pur
pose of cementing the sidehill of the
Phyllis canal; and the authorization of
bonds in the sum of $189,2000.00 for
the purpose of refunding bonds which
become due during the eight years.
The cementing of the Phyllis side
hill is an improvement that should
be authorized. It has been thorough
ly investigated by the board of direc
tors and a saving in maintainance in
water, and in crops amply justify the
improvement. Figures dealing with
the benefits of this particular improve
ment will be submitted later in these
columns.
The necessity for the improvement
of the Phyllis canal at the hillside is
known to the landowners of the Pio
neer Irrigation District but actual facts
will be appreciated. These facts will
be published before the election.
Bonds Falling Due
The proposition of issuing refunding
bonds to take up the bonds that will be
come due during the next few years
will most certainly carry. The Pio
neer Irrigation District is in splendid
condition financially but it is the part
of wisdom to spread the liquidation
of the present outstanding bonds over
a longer period of time.
Mr. J. Jester, Jr., secretary of the
Pioneer Irrigation Distict has pre
pared for The Tribune a table of out
standing bonds of the District showing
the amounts and date of maturity.
This table is entirely self explanatary.
It will be .noted that in 1917, $32,100
will have to be paid out unless the
bonds are refunded. This will be a
too heavy and entirely unnecessary
tax upon the people of the district.
The bonds and interest become due
as follows unless the refund issue is
authorized:
1917—
Principal maturing $21,400
Interest $10,700
. $32,100
(About 92c per acre on the
bonds alone).
1918—
Principal maturing $24,200
Interest $ 9,300
$33,500
(About 96c per acre).
1919—
Principal maturing $26,500
Interest $ 7,800
$34,300
About 98c per acre).
1920—
Principal maturing $30,700
Interest $ 6,100
(About $1.05 per acre).

STONE APPEALS FROM
ORDER BOARD OF
COMMISSIONERS
Alfred F. Stone filed an appeal to
the district court Tuesday, from cer
tain orders of the board of county
commissioners of Canyon County, al
lowing fees to attorneys who assisted
County Attorney Griffiths in the ac
tions brought to foreclose tax liens.
Mr. Stone states that he "deems the
orders mentioned to be illegal and
prejudicial to the public interests, and
a lavish, improvement expenditure of
the public funds."
Objection is made to an order of
the commissioners on June 6, 1916, al
lowing the bill of Plowhead and
Wallace for services in foreclosing tax
liens in the sum of $350 made upon
June 8, 1916, ratifying and confirming
the employment of H. A. Griffiths, .
county attorney of Curtis Haydon, M.
H. Etistac, J. J. Plowhead, and H. E.
Wallace as special counsel to assist
in the foreclosure of tax liens and that
order made upon July 11, allowing
the bill of M. H. Eustace for services
in foreclosing tax liens in the sum of
$75. The appeal is taken from the
whole of said orders and each and
every one of them to the district
court of the Seventh judicial district.
Says No Order Made
The complaint on appeal alleges
that no order employing the attorneys
mentioned appears upon the records
of the proceedings of the board of
county commissioners, and that no
such order has ever been made and
that the board did not act as a board
in the employment of counsel, if it
ever in fact did attempt to employ
them.
Further complaining, the appellant
alleges {hat the county attorney has
no authority to employ counsel to as
sist him in any manner whatsoever
and "that the attempted ratification
of such employment by the board is
invalid and of no force." Concluding,
the complaint respectfully demands
that the orders complained of be re
versed.
Employment Excited Comment
When it became known that the
County Attorney had employed at
torneys to assist him in these cases at
$25.00 ,per head a great deal of com
ment and criticism was provoked. It
was charged at the time that this was
a, gentlemanly raid on the taxpayers,
for the benefit of Democratic attor
neys. All told $925.00 is involved in
fees which these extra attorneys were
to have been paid. Of the total
amount $425.00 has already been paid
out by commission îrs. If it is held
that the action of the board is illegal
recovery suits will probably be filed
against county commissioners and
their bondsmen.
1921—
Principal maturing $35,400
Interest $ 4,100
$39,500
(About $1.13 per acre).
1922—
Principal maturing $38,600
Interest $ 1,900
(About $1.16 per acre).
1923—
Principal maturing
Interest

$ 6,000

$ 6,560
. $ 6,400
Interest $ 190

(About 19c per acre).
The above bond payments in addi
tion to mainenance and payments on
government contract will make assess
ments heavy
