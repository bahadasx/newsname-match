When she was twelve years old her
father, James Carpenter,
He left the farm and movedj to the
village of New Oregon on the Turkey

site of Cresco.
On Nov. 18th, 1862, Sarah was mar
ried at her home to W. H. Patterson, a
young lieutenant of Co. I, 38th Iowa

The ceremony was performed by Rev.

Six years later they came to the new
town of Cresco and the remainder of
her life was spent in Cresco, 44 years

J. B. Mitchell, all of Cresco.

but bore them uncomplainingly, never
forgetting the promise of Him in whom
she trusted and who said "My grace is
sufficient for every day and trial."
Her faith never wavered, her trust did
not falter, nor was she known to mur
mur, no matter how dark the hour of
trial.

Wfnnesheik Wim Head* or Tails.
Whether Wilson or Hughes be elected
November 7th, the Iowa presidential
elector from the Fourth Iowa District
will be a Winneshiek County man. G.
A. Meyer, of Calmar, is the Democratic
presidential elector for the Fourth Dis
trict and Ellis J. Hook, of Decorah, is
the Republican elector. It happened
also that there was a fumble in the
nomination petitions of each man, so
that neither man's name was printed
on the primary ballot, though each was
the choice of his party. But the names
of Meyer and Hook were written in by I
the Democrats and the Republicans, so
now they are the clear quill nominees
for presidential elector. In 1912 the
Democratic elector for the Fourth Dis
trict was a Winneshiek County man, I.
W. Brunt, of Decorah.
Civil Service Examinations.
A series of competitive civil service
examinations will be held on various
dates between September 11th and
November 29, 1916, at Mason City and
Dubuque, for a large list of various
kinds of positions in the government
service. Further information, includ
ing lists of positions for which exami
nations will be held may be secured of
Miss Stella O'Brien, secretary of the
local civil service board, the secretary
of the Board of Examiners at St. Paul,
Minn., or at the offices where examina
tions are held.

but decided to come to Iowa. He came
to Howard county in 1856 and pre
empted land in Albion township where
he remained a few years, enduring the
privations and hardships of pioneer life.
Meredith Makes Novel Offer.
"I am anxious that every voter in
Iowa should know exactly where I
stand on all problems," writes E. T.
Meredith, Democratic candidate for
governor of Iowa. "I am anxious they
should know my position on the road
problem and that I am positively not
for paving, increased taxes, or any
$100,000,000 bond issue. That I am in
favor of the people having power to
build such roads as they desire but on
ly upon their own motion andfafter
their express approval.
I have stated my position in a speech
and wishing all to know my position I
have made the following offer:
$175.00 IN GOLD FREE
I will give $100.00 to the person 17
years or older who reads my road
speech to the most people by Septem
ber 15. I will give $50.00 to the per
son reading it to the next greatest
number and $25.00 to the next.
The speech may be read to a lodge
meeting, a Commercial Club meeting,
a Tax League meeting, Chautauqua,
Old Settlers' picnic, a group of men
gathered together for the purpose of
hearing the speech, or a meeting of
any kind held in Iowa, where the con
ditions are such that those in attend
ance can hear it. If it is read at a
county fair or other such gathering,
only those actually in the room where
it is read may be counted and the num
ber reported must be the number who
actually hear it through.
Conditions: Anyone, man, woman,
boy or girl, 17 years or older, may en
ter the contest. Report on meeting
must be made within one week from
date it is held. The name of the chair
man of meeting, if there is a chairman
or president, and the name of at least
three others in attendance must be sent
4rith report. The number to whom
epeedfi was read must be reported. If,
upon investigation, we find the num
ber reported in any case is purposely
or grossly exaggerated, the party so
doing will have his entire credit not
only for that meeting but for all meet
ings wiped out and dropped from the
contest.
Special copies of ^speech, taking
•bout 30 minutes to read, may be had
by addressing E. T. Meredith, Box My

Severe Wind and Hail Storm.
A severe wind, rain and hail storm
visited this section last Saturday after*
noon, and was especially severe in the
northern part of Howard County and in
western Winneshiek.
At Chester and vicinity, much dam*
age was done by wind and hail. At
Lime Springs and vicinity, the wind
was especially violent, damaging store
buildings in the town, and doing con*,
siderable damage to buildings in the
country. Hail caused great destruction
west and south of Howard Center and
north and east of Cresco, but very for*
tunately a large number of farmer!
were protected by hail insurance, near*
ly seventy-five notices of loss going
into the various insurance companies
from Cresco alone.
In Cresco, shade trees suffered con*
siderably and the light service waa
stopped until about nine o'clock when'
the wires were cleared of trees and
broken limbs. Several wooden siloa
were demolished in this vicinity.
Corn that was blown to the ground ia
straightening up finely, and small grain,
was not badly damaged by the storm
except where it was struck by the hail.
The storm of last Saturday did much
damage in southern Minnesota also,
and at Taopi blew down all the build*
ings with the exception of the com*
crib on th farm occupied by Will
Stern, formerly of Cresco, and injured
him seriously, he being confined to hla
bed with both an arm and a leg broken*.
