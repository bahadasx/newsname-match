BABY DEATHS
ON INCREASE
Stomach Disorder Epidemic
Worse Than Infantile Paraly
sis, Say Health Officials.
By ANDREW R KiE imi.
With twenty-nine baby deaths within
the past three weeks ar.d hundreds of
infant sufferers from stomach disorders.
District health officials declared yester
day that the city was facing an epidemic
mouch graver than the inf-ntile paralysis
To the prolonged heat and the careless
ness of many mothers in not giving the
proper medical attention to children when
stricken Is attributed the high mortality
record from diarrheal troubles-an in
,rease of nearly 60 Per cent over 191t.
"There have been only seven cases of
infantile paralysis, no deaths and three
of these cases are reported Well," added
the doctor, "whereas every day children
are coming down with diarrheal com
plaint, incidental to summer and irregu
larities of diet, and deaths are frequent."
The heat of the present week may bring
the mortality record up much higher.
The department yesterday gave a spe
it warnlitg to mothers to watch the
milk that in given to children and to im
mediately seek medical aid if a cilld
shows lassitude.
When a child is stricken it should be
taken to a physician at once If money
is not available the physicians to the poor
gladly will furnish treatment. as will the
different linics throughout the city.
