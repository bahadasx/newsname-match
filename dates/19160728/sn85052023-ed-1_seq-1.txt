GREAT FAIR IN
MERCER COUNTY
Lincoln County Exhibitors Fare Very
Well And Big Crowds Are On
Hand Each Day Awards
The Country Fair Circuit up in
this end of the state opened most aus
piciously at Harrodsburg Tuesday.
Although the weather was very warm
it was what everybody called "ideal
fair weather," and the people didn't
seem to mind that, for they were on
hand by the thousands "from the
lead mines." A splendid program
was offered each day, the show of
horse and other live stock being very
good as were also the exhibits in the
floral hall department. Secretary
Clel Coleman was on the job all of
the time, with a splendid and most
accomodating bunch of young fel
lows as assistants and they made the
visitors from far and near feel that
it was good to have been there.
Quite a number from Lincoln were
on hand each day but the third day,
Thursday, was the big day for Lin
coln county people, and fully 50 or
more went over primarily to boost
for Stanford's big fair, Aug. 23, 24
and 25.
Stanford and Lincoln county ex
hibitors fared well in show rings.
The great Han-is & Woods string of
show mules had things almost their
own way in the hybrid classes. C.

bunch of blues on his poultry. The

MIDDLEBURG
The Baptist people are building a
veranda and are putting other re
pairs on the parsonage. ' The prop
erty had become somewhat dilapidat
ed and these repairs ara adding
greatlv to its appearance.
We have had fine rains of late and
a fine '-em crop is an assured fact.
That crop never looked better, be
sides a large acreage is growing.
Katydids began their dispute in
the trees on the night of the 15th,
which indicated that a killing frost
wi?' delay its coming till that date
in October, say those who have ob
served these things.
Mrs. J. C. Coulter cut her hand
pretty badly a few days since while
canning fruit. She twisted the top
off a can when her hand came in con
tact with the broken glass.
Jordan S.McWhorter has return
ed from Danville, where he went
some two weeks ago to be treated
for cancer. On reaching the hos
pital it was decided that amputation
of .his right arm was necessary arid
Drs. Jackson, Couch and others per
formed thp operation. Jordan is one
of the cleverest of fellows and his
friends here greatly sympathize with
him in his misfortune.
UNCLE SAM GETS TWO HERE
Will Let and Jeff Bryant Again
Charged W ith Bootlegging.
Jeff Bryant and Bill Lee, two no
torious bootleggers, of Macksville,

Saufley and taken to Danville to
have their preliminary trial before

is the second time Deputy Collector
Saufley has gotten the goods on these
two violators and it is a pretty saf"
prediction that Judge Cochran of
the Federal court will give them a
penitentiary sentence this time,
which means that Stanford will be
rid of these two undesirables for at
least a year, during which time they
will be put at hard labor.

KILLED BY
LIGHTNING
Green Tucker, Colored Meets Sudden
Death While Taking Shelter from
Storm in Mat Myers' Barn.
Lightning, which has been playing
havoc with barns, buildings and
other property in Lincoln and ad
joining counties for the past week
or so, took its toll of human life
here about thitee o'clock Tuesday
afternoon. Green Tucker, colored,
who was working for Mat Myers on
the W. H. Shanks farm, on the
Somerset pike, two miles south of
Stanford, was struck by a bolt of
lightning and instantly killed. Mr.
Myers and, eight other men were
standing within a few feet of Tuck
er when he was killed. Several were
severely shocked. All had most mi
raculous escapes from death.
Mr. Myers and his hands, includ
ing Tucker, took refuge in the large
barn, when the severe thunder, light
ning and rain storm swept over this
section about three o'clock Tuesday
afternoon. The men were standing
about in the center of the structure
in which they had sought refuge.
They felt that there was much less !
danger there than close to a door.
Witnesses of the fatality say that'
Tucker was standing a little off to
himself, with his hands in his pock
ets when a blinding flash came. It
struck the barn, and a ball of white
like fire descended, seemed to run
along the main suporting beam of
the barn roof, and to drop right on
Tucker. Mr. Myers was looking at
it and saw it strike the unfortunate
negro.
"It struck Tucker with what seem
ed terrific force," said Mr. Myers, in
describing the accident, "and lifted
him off his feet, several feet above
the ground. He fell backward with
out a ,sound. The flash was dazzling
and bjinded us 'all. When we got to
Tucker he was dead. I felt his pulse
and there was none. Tom Mobley
grabbed a bucket of water and threw
it on his face, thinking he was only
stunned, perhaps, but when I felt for
his pulse I saw he was stone dead.
The boys picked up his body and laid
it on a trough and a sort of electricity
seemed to play over the body for
several seconds afterward. Ham Ad
ams and Tom Tapp were severely
shocked. Two hogs, one on each side
of Tucker were killed also."
Mr. Myers said that very little
damage was done to the barn, the
bolt of lightning seeming to enter
through the opening or areaway and
to run along the main beam before
it dropped to the ground, striking
Tucker, as it did so.
Tucker was a hard working ne
gro, respected and liked by all who
knew him. He lived near Boneyville
and his remains were taken home to
his wife and large family after it
was seen there was no chance to re
suscitate him.
JOE BEASLEY KILLED.
Joe Beasley, 36 years old, of Clin
tonville, Bourbon county,' who has
a great many relatives in this sec
tion of the state was struck by light
ning and instantly killed about 3:30
o'clock Monday afternoon on the
Letcher Weathei's farm, near Clin
tonville. Mr. Beasley, in company
with his father, Mason Beasley, and
several others had been working in
a tobacco field on Mr. Weather's
place. Seeing that a storm was ap
proaching they sought shelter in a
tobacco barn near by.
Hardly had they reached the barn
when the storm broke. Mr. Beasley
and his father were standing in the
door, the others having gone to the
rear of the barn. Mr. Beasley and his
father were commenting on the
storm and the former asked if it
would be safe, there in case of light
ning. The words were hardly said
before a bolt of lightning struck the
door of the barn, killing Mr. Beas
ley instantly and severely shocking
his father.
The crystal on his watch was melt
ed and the works were torn to pieces
but there was no mark of any kind
on his body. The barn was only
slightly damaged. Mr. Beasley is
survived by his father, three sisters.
Mrs. AJberfc .Myers, of Lexington;
Mrs. William Mann, of Clintonville,
and Mrs. Earnest Stivers, of 'Jack
son; two brothers. R. N. Beasley, of
Paint Lick, and Ben Beasley, of Lex
ington. Diarrhoea Quickly Cured.
"About two years ago I had a se
vere attack of diarrhoea which lasted
for over a week," writes W. C.
Jones, Buford, N. D. "I became so
weak that I could not stand upright.
A durggist recommended Chamber
lain's Colic, Cholera and Diarrhoea
Remedy. The first dose relieved me
and within two days I was as well as
