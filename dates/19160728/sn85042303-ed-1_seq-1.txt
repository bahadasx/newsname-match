That Ardmore will bo taking an

A treaty for the purchase of the
Danish West Indies by the I'nited
States has, been negotiated between
the governments of Denmark and the
I'nited States and In the near future
is to be submitted to the senate of the
I'nited Slates and to the two houses
of the Danish parliament for approval,
it is announced. If the treaty is rati
fied as it stands in "project" form, the
I'nited States will pay for the islands
$2.r),000,0(M), and in addition will relin
quish to Denmark the rights of the
I'nited Stales in Greenland. Green
land is a Danish possession and the
rights which the I'nited States will
abandon are merely rights of discov
ery, the scope of which Is ill defined.
Tin; I'nited States will obtain from
Denmark full possession of the islands
of St. Thomas, St. John nnd St. Croix,
or Santa Cruz, as it is better known.
These islands lie nbout fifty miles off
the east coast of 1'orto Rico. They are
142 square miles In area and support
a population of 27,000 persons. Near
ly all the inhabitants of the Islands are
negroes who live by the cultivation of
sugar cane. The islands will be useful
to the United .States as coaling stations
or naval stations. Many efforts have
been made in the past half century or
so to have the I'nited States take over
of Denmark, who will cede the islands
hers of the advisory board and the
city commissioners will work in uni
son to pee that, the improvements are
of the very best nature, and pushed
as expeditiously as possible.
With the new theater, the new hotel
and convention hall all under con
struction together with t Do .stimulus
of paving and building activity, the
prospects for the fall and winter were
never better for Aidinore.
In the meantime, every property
owner is being asked to go to the
polls Monday and vote for the bond
issue.

BETWEEN 96 AND 98 PER CENT
OF MEMBERSHIP FAVOR WALK
OUT COUNTING MAY BE FIN
ISHED AUG. 6.
St. Louis, Mo., July 27. The "strike
vote" of the four train service broth
erhoods, which ended tonight at mid
night, resulted overwhelmingly in fa
vor of a strike.
Confidential advices, received to
night from all sections of the country,
justify tin' forecast that from between
!nj and !S per cent of the brother
hoods' membership h.ivo voted in favor
of a nation-wide strike, affecting prac
tically every railroad In the United
States, and approximately 110,000 em
ployes. In the St. Louis district the per
centage will probably exceed the
above estimate. On reliable author
ity it is estimated that Frisco em
ployes have been practically unani
mous In the casting of the strike bal
lot. Ninety-nine per cent of the men
are said to have voted for the "walk
out."
The vote on the Missouri, Kansna
& Texas is said to have fallen a littlo
short of that on the Frisco, the per
centage in favor of a strike beit i?
estimated at 9S. The strike percent
age on the Missouri Pacific was esti
mated tonight at approximately 97.
Neither brotherhood nor railway of
ficials would discuss the matter for
publication tonight. Leaden of the
employes, however, predicted that ihe
tabulation of the: vote, to be maJe'fn
New York within the next 'ow clays,
would show that, from 97 to 3il pr
cent of the men had voted for the
strike. Railway officials admitted
that their best information indicated
that the percentage would be "some
where in the 90s."
The ballots cast in the St. Louis
district will be taken to New York,
un-openrd by the-general chairmen
who have collected them. They will
be delivered to the brotherhood hind
quarters In the ITroadway Centra! ho

tabulation will be commenced within,
the next few days. '
