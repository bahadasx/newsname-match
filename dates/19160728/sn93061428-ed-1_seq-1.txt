tiulrrter of the Texas division. A de
coy letter was mailed at Carlsbad on
the train with a marked ten duller
bill addressed to one of the officers at
Pecoe who went to the Pecos post of
fice and failed to And the letter. The
officers went down on the same train.
Mr. Cudd was then arrested on sus
picion and immediately searched and
the bill found in his possession. Up
on being charged with the theft he
broke down and confessed. The mail
between Carlsbad and Pecos had been
lundered for more than year and
t was very well known by the post
office people here and In Pecos and
elsewhere that Cudd was the guilty
party but it was up to the inspectors
to work up s use that would land the
game and now the authorities have
him safe, but he came within an ace
of giving them the slip. When the
train arrived here Friday evening he
asked permission to go to his hone
and change clothes and was accom
panied by one of the inspectors who
waited outsjde while he went In the
house. The inspector waited for some
time and then went In and found hi,
bird had flown, Cudd going out the
back door and hid until after dark,
and then walked to the McMillan dam
where he was seen by. some one Sat
urday and where he got a ride with
some people who were going to Ros
well where ho was again arretted on
the street Monday morning, and plac
ed In jail. He will be tried in the
federal court and if convicted of the
crime of which he is charged will be
held in some place where federal
prisoners are placed for a term of

friends of his family are sincerely
grieved that such a horrible chargo
should be brought against Mr. Cudd
and hope it may not be as bad as n
norted.
