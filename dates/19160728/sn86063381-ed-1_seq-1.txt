Has Excellent Farm.
About 25 automobiles accompanied
the tourists yesterday morning from
Bemidji to Bagley. The tourists
were much inspired by the excellent
appearing farm of Ole Sime near Sol
way. Mr. Sime has just completed
a large new barn and a new home and
when the tourists passed his place he
was constructing a road from the
highway to his home. The tourists
showed their appreciation by honk
ing their automobile horns and cheer
ing him.
Solway Does Well.
The village of Solway did itself
proud in greeting the party. There
are three cars in the town of Lam
mers and everyone of those cars were
on hand to greet the highway offi
cials. About 35 people were in Sol
way to listen to the addresses given
by members of the highway party.
Solway is interested in the high
way and is ready to do its share.
John Thoreen of Solway made the
following statement to me:
"We are all very busy at this time
haying. Good weather is scarce and
valuable, but we could not miss an
occasion like this to help the Jeffer
son highway movement. The high
way is a big thing for us and we
are ready to do our share."
Solway is Growing.

VILLAGE OF SOLWAY GIVES PARTY
WARM WELCOME MANY CARS IN LINE
By F. G. Neumeier.
(Editor of the Pioneer)
Thief River Falls, with the Jefferson Highway tourists, July 28.
Did you ever follow a successful presidential candidate on a tour through
the country and note the enthusiastic reception that is given him at the
different villages and cities?
Did you ever notice the enthusiasm that is brought about in a vil-
lage or city, at a college or university, over a winning baseball, foot-
ball or basket ball team?
Much Enthusiasm Displayed.
If you have followed a successful presidential candidate and noted
the enthusiasm and if you have not ed the enthusiasm in regard to a win-
ning baseball, basket ball or football team, you can imagine how enthu-
siastically the Jefferson highway offi-$
cials are greeted along the route
which they are dedicating as the
"Pine to Palm" route in Minnesota.
You can imagine it only in a small
degree as to what it really is unless
you make a trip with the Jefferson
highway officials and see the way the
officials are greeted.
First Time in History.
Never before in the history of
Northern Minnesota has a project
been so enthusiastically greeted.
People are flocking to the by-ways
and the highways where the party
passes, to the towns and villages to
hear the speakers and to see the men
who are working to make the Jeffer
son highway the success that it is
going to be.
"I would rather have the enthu
siasm that we have received from the
people in the places from Little Falls
to Thief River Falls," said J. D.
Clarkson, general manager of the Jef
ferson highway, today, "than to have
a donation of $50,000 for the route.
I mean by this that I know that by
the enthusiasm the people are be
hind this project, they are interested
in it and they will see that the high
way gets the proper support."
The people of Northern Minnesota
are interested in the Jefferson high
way because of its vital importance
to secure better roads.
To Bring 10,000.
b. w. Wolsfenofort or"Be"S Moinasv*
Ia., publicity representative of the
Jefferson highway, today told me that
10,000 tourists from southern points
will come to Minnesota this year over
the Jefferson highway and the high
way is just being located, the actual
construction of it in Minnesota has
not started. According to Mr. Wol
stencroft, 500 queries from the south
were received by the automobile blue
book representative up to May first
of this year in regard to Northern Min
nesota and the roads in this district.
This is just an example of how in
terestd the people of the south are
in the new highway.
The people of Northern Minuseota
are also interested and they are
showing their interest and apprecia
tion of the selection of the route by
greeting the highway officials. They
are showing their interest by having
roads dragged and repaired for the
Jefferson highway, tourists.
Solway is a rapidly growing vil
lage and its prosperity is shown in
the construction of a new brick build
ing to house the new Solway State
bank.
At Shevlin the party was greeted
by a big streamer that was hung
across the street. ^Dn the streamer
was printed, "Itasca State Park Auto
Road." Seven automobiles and a
large crowd of good road enthusiasts
cheered the speakers in this village.
"We are certainly glad that we got
the highway," said O. L. Dahl, the
Shevlin grocer. "It is the biggest
thing possible to develop this com
munity." He, I believe, voiced the
sentiment of the entire village of
Shevlin.:
To Crush Rock.
A capital idea was expressed by one
member of the tourist party between
Shevlin and Bagley. He suggested
that a rock crushing machine be se
cured by the county and the rock
picked up when clearing farms, be
dumped along side of the roads and
crushed by this machine. The
crushed rock could then be used for
constructing roads. If this idea
could be carried into effect it would
undoubtedly mean that good substan
tion roads would be constructed.
Thirty cars and the Bagley band
were on hand to give the tourists a
fine reception at Bagley. The Bag
ley autoists accompanied the tour
ists to Clearbrook.
The village of Clearbrook was dec
orated with flags and there were
about 15 automobiles on deck to
greet the highway officials.
Gonvick Enthusiastic.
At Gonvick there were also about
15 cars out to give the Jefferson men
a welcome. H. K. Jones, editor of
the Gonvick Banner, stated that Gon
vick was very enthusiastic about the
highway and was ready to do its share
in maintaining the highway.
The highway brought out much en- tlantic, during which time they served
t,husdiiai&-l^ :6nyr?-Ther^'i^re 15
automobiles filled with good road en
thusiasts on hand to greet the tour
ists.
"The highway is bringing out much
enthusiasm in Gully," said A. Stark,
who piloted the press car. "The
roads are being improved now and we
are ready to do our share."
Five Cars at Trail.
Five automobiles hit the trail with
the Jefferson officials at Trail.
"We are all worked up about it,"
C. A. Dahl, the Trail banker told me.
"Trail is not a very big place, but
we are ready to do what we can."
Oklee, although one and one-half
miles from the highway route, ac
corded the party a warm welcome.
The little village expressed its hap
piness over being near the highway
route by having 35 automobiles on
hand to greet the highway officials
and by having the Oklee hand give
a band concert. The tourists spent
their noon control at Oklee and were
served with a fine chicken dinner at
the Angelterre hotel. The Oklee
people cheered th highway speakers
lustily.
Road Being Improved.
At Bemidji it was reported that
the road to Oklee was not in the
best of condition. The tourists found
the road in fair condition but were
happy to hear that the people of the
community realized that the roads
were not up to the standard and that
the people were ready to better the
roads. With that spirit, the people
will undoubtedly see that the Jeffer
son highway in their vicinity is kept
up to the standard. All along the
route from Bemidji to Trail signs of
prosperity could be seen. No less
than 50 large, new dairy barns are
in the course of construction along
the road, land is being cleared and
the roads are being repaired.
Crops are in a fair condition but
rust is going to decrease the crop in
several sections. (Continued pa Pace 4)

TWENTY-ONE TARS
ROLL INTO BEMIDJI
EARLYTHISMORNING
Twenty-one of Bemidji's "tars" re
turned this morning from the annual
cruise on the salt water of the At-
or ten days a& rggtii&f ^ackfesT":
In
order to spend a greater time in the
cities of the. east, Lieutenant B. A.
.Barker and the remaining fifteen sea
men stopped over at various places.
Having seen that the Bemidji divi
sion was safely entrained on the
"homeward bound" special train at
Philadelphia, Lieutenant Barker left
for a short visit at New York. Whit
ney Brown remained at Washington,
D. C, and Leonard French at Chi
cago, 111., while the balance of ^Be-
midji's representation are spen||pg
a short time at Duluth. I
"Hard boiled" and sophisticated in
the art of navigating sea-going craft,
particularly battleships, every mem
ber of the local crew is proud of a
deep salt water tan or a "wear-ever"
sea-burn.
Airriving in Philadelphia Tuesday
at eight bells, all militia men of the
Rhode Island, comprising the battal
ions of Ohio, Missouri and Minnesota,
disembarked at the naval wharf and
were marched to the special trains to
their respective states. Until seven
o'clock, six bells, the boys were given
liesure to go over their many pecul
iar happenings and but few there
were who were not lonesome for the
"piping down" and "turn to" calls
of the boatswain's mates.
Washington, D. C, was reached at
seven o'clock and as a special sight
seeing tour had been arranged for by
officers of the Minnesota battalion,
the tars embarked on the buses and
with a lecturer "navigated" about
city seeing prominent historic spots,
various memorials, the capitol build
ings and the city's business district.
When "anchor was weighed" after
the four-hour furlough at Washing
ton, the boys were hustled through
to Duluth. As both militia men and
regulars are neither particular whose i
clothes they wore or how many they
have, hammock and bag inspection
was held at the Duluth armory. That
the local boys were victorious in the
struggle of keeping their own clothe.?

GERMAN FORGES
MUST DOMINATE
VERDUN TO WIN
(United Press Staff Correspondent')
With the German army before Ver
dun, July 28.Germany's mastery at
Verdun has robbed the French of
their greatest chance to co-operate in
the allied drive. If the French, po
sitions had not been under attack
by the German forces they could have
hammered simultaneously with ..the
British thrust. But Germany now
dominates the situation.
German officers now say that the
main thing is not whether the Ger
mans can take Verdun, but that the
Teutons are now dominating the Ver
dun situation. Traveling along the
Verdun front in this section I find
general opinion to be the same as
that expressed by the grandson of
General von Steuben, Prussian hero
of the Revolutionary war, who says,
"The war will last long."
For ten miles on each side of Ver
dun trenches have literally been
blown off the face of the earth. Uni
versal respect is given by the Germans
here for the bravery of the French
soldiers.
Capture 163 Prisoners.
London, July 28.British troops
have driven the German Branden
burgers out of the Delville Wood, ac
cording to a report by General Haig
today. He said the German force
consisted of the Fifth Brandenburg
regiment. The official report says:
"One hundred and sixty-three pris
oners were captured in the Delville
Wood. The whole of the wood is
now in our possession. Counter at
tacks have been beaten off with a
heavy loss to the enemy."
Russians Continue Advance.
Petrograd, July 28.The Russian
advance along the region of Stonicvlci
continues as is also the case along the
Caucasus front.
