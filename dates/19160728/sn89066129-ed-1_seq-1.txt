News of All Sorts .
The Ladies Aid Society of the
Forker M. E. church will hold an
ice cream and cake 'social at the
Forker meeting house' on Thursday
evening, August 3, p which all
are-cordially invited. .
Rev. H. J. Dueker has a squad
of boy scouts on an outing this
week. They are capped on the
Goosey farm near the old water
mill on Locust creek. Reports come
that the boys are haying a fine time
and the minister the busiest job he
ever tackled.
The past week has been good
weather for the sale of electric fans.
Cay wood & Banm have sold two
ceiliug fans to the" Ladies Aid to
be placed in the Methodist church,
two celling fans to Simpson's con
fectionery, a desk fan to Wlilis
Stoddard and a desk fan to a party
at Chillicothe.
Al. James, one of Laclede's old
and well known colored ..citizens,
died at his home here last Thurs
day evening.. He was 72 years old
and leaves a widow, four sons and
two daughters, and many grand
children. The funeral was held at
the colored Baptist church Satur
day and the remains buried at
Locust creek cemetery southwest
of town.
The meeting to be addressed by
Rev. J, J. Davis of Indianapolis,
and announced to be held at the
Methodist church Saturday night
of this week, has been changed to
the city park. The para will be
lighted and there will be plenty
of comfortable seats and everybody
is invited to come out and hear a
talk on nation wide prohibition of
the liquor traffic.
It s a busy time with most
people, it's hot and uncomfortable
getting about, but these things
should not keep republicans from
going to the primary election next
Tuesday and registering their
choice of candidates. It is im
portant that we poll as large a vote
as possible and select the very best
ticket possible. This is an im
portant political year and no re
publican should shirk at this
critical time.
Laclede has been visited by two
booster bunches this week. On
Tuesday a large delegation in
twelve ,cars from Hale-, accom
panied by a band, was here boost
ing the Hale chautauqua, August
3-8. The speaker said that on ap
proachiog Laclede they struck the
best thing they had encountered on
the whole trip oiled roads. He
warmly congratulated Laclede and
hoped Hale might catch the spirit
and do likewise. Ou Wednesday
evening a dozen or more cars from
Milan, representing the Swanger-For-Governor
club of the second
congressional district, was here in
the interest of Mr. Swanger. On
account of a long drive and some
car trouble the delegation did not
reach here until 7:30, several hours
late, but they found an enthusiastic
crowd awaiting them. Similar
delegations were out from Kirks
ville and other north Missouri dis
tricts and it is generally conceded
that Mr. Swanger will get practi
cally every republican vote in this
part of the state next Tuesday.

Primary Next Tuesday
The primaries on next Tuesday,
August 1, in Missouri can become
an inspiration in powerful aid of
republican victory in November if
the republicans of the state do
their duty on that day. That duty
is to participate in the primary
voting as republicans. Then the
primary presents another important
opportunity. Republicans should
vote so as tohelp select not only a
good ticket, but the best, possible
ticket. If you neglect your duty
in this connection, the chances are
somebody vise will too. It is the
duty of every republican in this
precinct to go to the primary next
Tuesday and vote for John E.
Swanger for governor and Walter
S. Dickey for United States sena
tor. They will lead the party to
victory in November.

To Republican Voters
Having learned that letters
making personal attacks upon me
are being sent out to the voters
and this action on the eve of the
primary election, I take this
method of asking the closet and
strictest inquiry on the part of the
people of Linn county, among
whom I have lived during all the
years of my life, as to my conduct
as a citizen and as a public official,
and to say further that with such
investigation I shall confidently
and cheerfully await your verdict
at the polls on August 1.
Very truly yours,
Geo. W. Anderson.
Republican Candidate for Sheriff
To the Democratic Voters
Owing to the fact that I am com
pelled to work every day, and have
neither the time nor the means to
enable me to see personally each
Democratic voter of Linn county,
I desire to take this method of
making this final appeal for your
support on August 1.
I want to repeat and emphasize
what I have said heretofore; that
one term as County Treasurer is
all I shall ever ask at your hands.
As is well known by almost all
the voters of Linn county, I am a
widow, without means, with three
children to rear and educate and I
am very anxious to keep them with
me at all times.
My opponent for this nomination
has held the office of Treasurer for
seven years, has a competence and
no one to sapport but herself.
I was prevailed upon by many of
my friends to ask for this office
once at the hands of the voters of
Linn county, who have indeed
been liberal in the past and
I trust that you will be disposed to
assist me by giving me your vote
on next, Tuesday.
Very sincerely,
Marion Lander.
