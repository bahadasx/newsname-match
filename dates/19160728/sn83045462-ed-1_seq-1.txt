WORKS PROVISION
UPHELDjNSENATt
Vice President Overrules Point
of Order Made by Chairman
Smith.
LIBERAL TREATMENT
FOR DISTRICT IS URGED
Senators Generally of Opinion That
House Has Been Niggardly Toward
the National Capital.
The Works amendment to the
District appropriation bill, abolishing
the present form of govyyiment
in the District of Columbia,
providing that the United States
shall pay all of the expenses of
the District and that present District
taxes shall be paid directly
into the Treasury of the United
States, was upheld in the Senate
today by Vice President Marshall,
who overruled 3 point of order
made against the Works amendment
by Senator Smith of Maryland.
Vice President Marshall cited many
legal and constitutional points, but
at the same time said there probably
would be an appeal from the chair.
The main point of Vice President
Marshall's ruling was that the District
of Columbia is not a municipal
corporation, but is an agency of Congress
pure and simple.
Gallinger Proposes a Vote.
Instead of an appeal from the chair,
Senator Gallinger of New Hampshire
proposed that a direct vote on the
Works amendment be taken, and following
this suggestion a debate upon
that phase of that situation was begun.
That the House bill providing for the
District of Columbia is "indefensible."
was the statement made by Senator
Works of California, addressing the
Senate today in support of his plan to
have the "half-and-half* system done
away with and to have the federal government
pay all the expenses of the
District.
Other senators, including Sen; .ors
Gallinger and Dillingham, chimed in
with the view that the House had been
niggardly in its treatment of the District.
ays Taxes Are Too High. J <
Senator Works also insisted that the j
people of the District today are taxed 1
as much as are tl.e people of other 1
cities in this country of a similar size.! ,
He pointed out that a joint committee ]
of Congress investigating this question
had so found.
The California senator, while desirous
of doing away with the halfand-half
plan, believes that the government
should pay more than half j
the expenses of the District.
Opponents of the House rider abolishing
the half-and-half plan replied
to Senator Works that the opponents
of the half-and-half plan in the House j
?ook just the other position?that the 1
District should he made to pay as much '
. .* possible and the federal government
hould pay as little as possible of the
xpenses of the District.
Are Opposed to New Legislation.
It became evident that the opponents '
t the House rider would demand that j
he half-and-half plan be retained un- :
i! some adequate legislation amend..g
the organic act of 1878 should be ;
fiamed and passed upon by Congress. '
* An appropriation bill, they contended, i
. a* no place in which to make so vital !
:nd radical a change of the organic j
jLd of the District.
Every effort will be made to pass the j
District bill before adjournment to- j
night. But a large r.umber of senators
-.e planning to address the Senate on
he half-and-half plan, and also on the
question of the location of the new
municipal hospital, and it may require
all day tomorrow to complete consideration
of the measure.
Works Amendment Offered.
Immediately upon the taking up of
the District bill in the Senate this
morning. Senator Works of California ]
offered his amendment which would
not only do away with the half-andhalf
plan, but would wipe out the District
of Columbia as a municipality,
vest all the property rights of the District
in the federal government, have
the federal government pay all the ex- :
penses of the District, the residents of
the District to continue to pay a fair
and reasonable tax into the federal
Treasury.
This is the same plan which Senator
Works suggested during the investigation
Into the fiscal relations of the District
and the United States by a joint
select committee of Cong res? fall, j
Senator Works was himsel* a member j
of that joint committee.
Senator Smith of Maryland pointed
, out that Senator Works amendment ;
was subject to a point of order as j
being new legislation on an appropriation
bill. He said that he would re- j
I serve the right to make the point of
\ order when Senator Works had comk
pleted his discussion of the bill.
"Half-and-Half Plan Inadequate."
Discussing his proposed plan Senator
Works told the Senate that the halfand-half
plan was todav entfrolv i?._
" \
adequate and insufficient to meet the j
needs of the District, that it had been j
adopted by Congress as a compromise !
proposition forty years ago, and that j
the members of Congress who helped
enact it into law had not expected it
would be continued so Ion# in effect.
"One of those congressmen, a former
senator, who had more to do with this
legislation perhaps than any one else,
appeared before the joint select committee
and so testified." said Senator
Works. He referred to former Senator
Hlackburn of Kentucky, who was a j
member of the House at the time the !
organic act of 1878 was passed.
Senator Works said that unfortunately
many people in the District have believed
that, this question of caring for j
me kui i 'w oi. jncy
should take the broader view, he said,
that Washington is the capital of the
nation and that the people of the states
have just as much interest in the District
of Columbia as the residents here.
He pointed out that under the Constitution
Congress has exclusive jurisdiction,
in the District.
f % '"The District government as at present
organised is a mere shell," said

CAMPAIGN WILL BE
BIG EAFILE OF INK
Both Republicans and Democrats
to Use Elaborate
Publicity Methods.
G. 0. P. MANAGERS HAVE
TWO PLANS OF ACTION
One Group Would Immediately Get
Democrats on Run?Other Would
Wait for Enemy Disclosures.
BY N. O. MESSENGER.
NEW YORK, July 28.?Two 1
kinds of counsel for the opening
of the campaign are being of- '
fered and considered in republican 1
managerial circles. One group is 1
hot for immediate aggressive '
action, taking the lead, and, as 1
they say, "get the democrats on !
the run'' at once and keep therrr
going.
The other group is for holding '
back until the enemy unfolds his 1
plan of action and then shape the '
republican campaign accord- '
ingly. 1
Both sets of counselors offer reasons
to support their advice. Mr. Hughes' 1
speech of acceptance next Monday night f
will show which plan he adopts, and ^
the campaign will proceed as he directs,
with his speech as the keynote. {
Organization Being Effected. ?
In the meantime the national organization
is being rapidly put upon an
efficiency basis for vigorous action as
soon as the order to begin firing is ]
given. The militant arm 9f the national t
campaign committee is the literary and t
publicity bureau, of which David S. r
Barry of Washington is the director. r
By the time Mr. Hughes' speech has .
been read his bureau will be thoroughly
organized and advanced to the firing I
line. He will have a staff of assistants <3
which will include some of the best
writers to be drafted from the ranks of
journalism. The bureau in addition will .
jtilize every legitimate method of publicity
known in the art. ,
One feature planned for the campaign j
is the furnishing of a daily telegraphic i
news letter to all newspapers that de- *
sire it. It will not deal with strictly v
ex-parte statements, such as only a re- 8
publican party organ would publish, c
but will be political matter with a news
I'alue sufficient to render it attractive a
to an independent paper. The object of 8
the service will be to interest the read- w
ing public in the campaign as it P
progresses and the issues between the P
two parties as they arise.
b
Cartoons One Feature. J
A special feature is to be made of F
political cartoons, which will be sup- c
plied to papers in plate and matrix *
form as desired, to be immediately
available for the presses. The cartoon
jprvi r-A it i u ?- ?
... -w,?.vu, Will ue nignrlass
and designed to be a notable fea- 8
ture of the campaign.
The supplying of the old familiar 1
plate service to small newspapers will
be continued as in former campaigns. e
Moving pictures are to be utilized along 1
novel lines which are now being worked o
out.
The national committee also will use
the advertising space of the newspaper
and periodical press extensively?in- 1
deed, to a degree never attempted be- ^
fore. Every class of publication, from
the most expensive magazine to the a
humble weekly country newspaper, i
taking in the metropolitan dailies r
reaching their millions of subscribers, .
will be used in this way. r
As the democratic publicity bureau
also intends to adopt this method of r
reaching the public, which has built up ?
so many fortunes in commerce and e
production, a kind of advertising duel j
between the two organizations mas'- be <=
expected. There is to he no sparing of t
display type and printers' ink, that he j
who runs may, in fact, be able to peruse
as he sprints and weigh the re- t
spective merits of the political wares j s
set forth. I a
Another novel feature is to be a po- j
litieal joint debate over the character. ,
virtues and public services of Wood- J
row Wilson and Charles Evans Hughes, (
which will appear weekly in a well .
known periodical which boasts of an
especial clientele among the "high- .
brows." I
Authors of the Effort.
Jacob Gould Schurman of Cornell
University Is to write the republican
chapters and Norman Hapgood the
,i In tVilo
politico-literary effort. Attention will 1
be directed to the magazine in due ; 3
time and through the proper channels
of the advertising columns.
The Woman's Alliance is to furnish
the women of the land interested in
politic? with a magazine of their own.
The first issue is already under way.
and is said to be a publication of excellence.
Director Barry has moved |nto the
committee's new quarters in the Postal
building, corner of 5th avenue and
43d street, and already has begun the
allotting of contracts for the extensive
publicity service. The democratic headquarters
are just around the corner, on
4 2d street, and the rival camps are
practically close enough to swear at
each other when the campaign gets
hot.
.Evidence accumulates that this presidential
campaign is to be the most extensive
and expensive one for both parties
since the memorable campaign of
1896 was waged, although this will not
reach the high water mark of expenditure
then attained.
Millions Were Spent.
Today I asked one of the republican
managers of that campaign what It
cost. The republicans," he said, "to
my knowledge spent exactly $3,480,000
and the democrats, I was told by their
managers at the time, spent $1,700,000
Our committee shipped 137 carloads of
publications. It was the most exten- 1
slve campaign of education ever attempted
anywhere for any purpose. 1
"When all the bills were paid the
late Mark Hanna, the chairman, asked
if there was any money left. i
-We have a balance of 3136,000,'" |
he was told.
Just say that again, will you.'-said '
Mr. Hanna, placing his hand to his ear. 1
"It was a fact. Not a bill was left
unpaid, Including a bill of $2,700 which :
we considered as blackmail, but which
he ordered paid, and we had the bal- 1
ance as stated."
CAPITAL TO HAVE
P. 0JOWNTOWN
New Branch Is to Be Located
at 514 llth Street
Northwest.
MR. CHANCE ANNOUNCES
PLANS FOR SUBSTATION
Will Have Twenty Collections and
Deliveries of Mail Daily,
Except Sunday.
Washington is to have a downtown
post office.
For the accommodation of the
business men Postmaster Merritt
3. Chance has made arrangements
to open a large, fully
equipped, classified station on or
before October i, at 514 nth
street northwest between E and
F streets.
The need for such an office has
seen emphasized by the business
Tien ever since the removal of the
:ity post office from the Post
Dffice Department building to its
lew home.
Postmaster Chance decided on the
ocation after the receipt of letters
rom practically every business man.
>etween Pennsylvania avenue and H
street and 9th and 15th streets, all
irging that postal facilities be estabished
in some such central location.
To Be the Biggest Branch.
That this office will not only be the
argest substation in Washington, but
hat it will do more city business than
he central office at Massachusetts avelue
and North Capitol street, is the
prediction of the postmaster. "I look
o see it do as much business as any
>ost office in the country," he said tolay.
This new office will be open from 7
i.m. until midnight, excepting on Sunlays,
when it will be closed. There
vill be t,wenty collections and deliveres
of mail daily, for all the important
ncoming and outgoing trains. The
act that it will be open until midnight,
irlth full equipment for parcel post and
pecial delivery service will be a big
onvenience to business men.
At this office business men will be
ble to get stamps and other postal
upplies in as large quantities as they
fish. There will be an unlimited suply
of all kinds of stamps and stamped
aper.
Xt IS ine purpuse 10 mane iiiir how
usiness-center post office a model in
very way. The furniture will be that
rom the model post office at the
'anama-Paciftc exposition in San Franisco,
including: all the latest devices
or postal service in steel furniture.
To Have Ample Floor Space.
This is to be known as the ilth street
tation, and has ample floor space,
ostal officials say, for taking care of
he entire city postal business of
Vashington, as segregated from govrnmental
and departmental "business,
t is to be, in reality, the city post
ffice.
Three parcel post, two money order,
>ne registry and postal savings, one
ock box and one wholesale stamp winows
will be in operation as needed, in
ddition to extra windows for use durng
the Christmas rush. An ample
lumber of lock boxes and drawers will
orm a part of the equipment.
Trained employes will be in charge
?f the work at this important station,
jpecial provision will be made for an
xpeditious handling of outward-bound
?arcel post mail, thus insuring prompt
ervice in every branch of the work
o business men and patrons in that
ocality.
Howard Beall, the present superinendent
of station G, at 8th and F
treets northwest, who is familiar with
ill branches of station work, will be
n charge. John H. Simmons, former
issistant superintendent of station G,
vill be designated in charge of station
i, filling the vacancy caused by the
ransfer of Mr. Beall.
Business Men Generally
Are Delighted to Learn
of New Downtown Office
Officers of all the civic organizations
n wasnington ami oubhicbo men Llly
were delighted when they learned
his afternoon that a downtown city
>o8t office is to be opened.
William T. Galliher, vice president ot
he Board of Trade, said: "That certainly
s a long step toward efficiency in local
>ostal affairs. The location is as cenral
as could be secured, and T have no
loubt but that the 11th street station
will soon be doing as large a business
is any city post office in the country,
:hus justifying the contention of the
jusiness men ever since the removal of
he city station from its old location on
he Avenue. Postmaster Chance is to
>e congratulated on his good judgnent."
Similar sentiments were expressed by
P. T. Moran. president of the Chamber
>f Commerce, who said that the busiiess
men of Washington will show by
heir patronage that a downtown office
a an oKgaIhIa npfPBsit v In Wnahlncfnn
'Many business houses." he said, "have
jufTered great inconvenience and even a
curtailment of business as a result of
failure to provide accommodations for
:he business men when the city office
was removed to its new site near Union
station. That office may be efficiently
located for the transaction of government
mail from the Capitol and the
government printing office, but it has
Deen very inaccessible for business men
ind has caused serious delays.
Should Do Big Business From Start.
"The new office should do a big business
from the start, and soon show the
postal authorities that what we really
need is a big downtown office in a building
of its own."
That the merchants of Washington
appreciate this move for their convenience
is testified by R. P. Andrews,
president of the Retail Merchants' Asso(rcwillpysd

INFANTILE PARALYSIS ~
ISSMUNCHECKED
! Today's Report Shows Slight Increase
in Number of Deaths and
Decrease in New Cases.
NEW YORK, July 28.?The epidemic
of infantile paralysis still is unchecked,
| the daily report of the health department
shows. The bulletin issued today discloses
a slight increase in deaths and a small decrease
in the number of new cases. During
the twenty-four-hour period ending
J at 10 o'clock this morning there were 134
new cases and 35 fatalities from the
disease reported in the five boroughs of
New York city.
The city health authorities and Mayor
Mitchel conferred today in regard to the
composition of a list of fifteen or twenty
prominent physicians who will be invited
to come to New York from different parts
j of the country and join the battle against
j infantile paralysis. The visiting physi)
ciafts will receive all their expenses and
I the board of estimate yesterday unaniI
mously voted $3,000 for this purpose.
Commissioner of Health Emerson said
he hoped to hold the conference Thursday
or Friday of next week.
Expects Important Developments.
On account of the attention this disease
has received lately throughout the
United States, Commissioner Emerson
expects that this meeting will develop
| many new and important suggestions
for checking the spread of the epidemic.
In his letter to Mayor Mitchel suggesting
the conference Dr. Emerson said:
"The opinion of capable physicians
and scientists in this city and elsewhere i
is to the effect that advance in our
knowledge of the disease, infantile!
paralysis, might be obtained as the re-j
suit of a conference in this city during
I the present epidemic of leaders in |
scientific thought anrl investigation in j
^this country. There are from fifteen to
twenty men from Chicago to Boston in
the medical centers who have made important
contributions to various phases
of preventive medicines. I believe their
presence here in New York for two or
three days would result in organized efforts
in various laboratories to supplement
the work now being done under
,i-the committees of research in this city."
BRITISH DRIVE ENEMY
FROM AFRICAN POSITION
LONDjON, July 28.?The following ofI
flcial statement on the progress of the
British campaign in German East Africa
.has been given out:
"Brig. Gen. Northey reports that on
| July 24 he drove the main German
southern detachment of the enemy from
strongly organized positions astride the
Neu Langenburg-Irangi road at Malangali.
After counter attacks the enemy
, retired hurriedly in the direction of
| lrangi. abandoning a 4.1-inch howitzer
and two machine guns.
"Among a number of German Europeans
captured previously was Dr. Stir,
late governor of the Neu Langenburg
district. Dr. Stir has since died of
wounds. A majority of the surviving
members of the crew of the German
cruiser Koenigsberg form a part of the
German forces in this area."

Submarine Deutschland Ready to
Sail at Any Moment.
BALTIMORE, July 2S?The growing
impression that the German submarine
freighter Deutschland was delaying*
her departure for Germany until word
was received from her sister ship, the
Bremen, took on the appearance of ;
fact today when it was learned from a i
source regarded as reliable, that she ,
would not sail until official information
had been received from the Bremen
by her agents here.
The Deutschland is loaded, her cargo
has been carefully trimmed, the machinery
satisfactorily tested, it is understood,
and the underwater liner is
ready to sail on short notice.
It also was said on good authority
that the Deutschland would make no
secret attempt at a getaway, but that
it was probable she would leave her
pier during the day time in order to
arrive at the capes under the cover of
darkness.

APPEAL FOR CASEMENT
ABANDONED BY DEFENSE

No Action Was Under Contemplation.
?
LONDON. July 2R.?When the court of
criminal appeal met today to hear a
possible application in behalf of Roger
Casement, who was sentenced to death
for treason in connection *with the recent
Dublin uprising, it was found that
the defense had abandoned any con- templated
action.
It was disclosed, however, that somebody
connected with the defense had
informed the king's coroner of a wish j
to reopen argument of a point abandoned
by Alexander Sullivan, Casement's
counsel, in the appeal court when ques- c
tioning Lord Reading's interpretation *
of the law in his summing up, on the v
ground that Mr. Sullivan had no au- t
thority to withdraw the point men- r
tioned. *
Justice Darling said it could hardly *
be alleged with anything approaching c
plausibility that Mr. Sullivan had not i
authority to do what he did, and he ! 3
added that despite Mr. Sullivan's ac- 1 ^

lammering at the Austrian lines in the
Slonevka region, from which river Gen.
Sakharoff's forces have driven the

Brody and facilitate an advance toward
Lemberg along this line.
The Russians have resumed their attack
southeast of Vladimir-Volynski,

the morale of the German troops.

Ire of but a few hours before, and has
talked freely with the men engaged.

LONDON, July 28, 2:56 p.m.?
British troops have captured Delville
wood in its entirety, a British
official statement announced
this afternoon. This German
position in the Somme region,
termed by some as "hell's crucible,"'had
been defended by the
Brandenburg division, which was
driven out. Two counter attacks
nave been repulsed.
Russians reconnoitcring at Auberive,
in the Campagne, says the
French official statement issued
this afternoon, penetrated the
German trenches and cleared
them with hand grenades. The
Russians took some prisoners.
A German attemnt tn
near Lihons, north of Shaulnes,
was arrested by French infantry
fire.
On the, right bank of the
Meuse, in the Verdun region,
German preparations to attack
Thiaumont work were stopped
by artillery fire.
Two German aeroplanes were
shot down in the Somme region.
Strong British attacks against
the German positions in Foureaux
wood, in the Somme region, broke
down yesterday under the German
fire, savs the official statement
issued today at German
irmy headquarters.
Great British Shell Fire.
The Germans had been quiet at Delrille
wood because the British made no
nfantry attack lor some days, but all *
:he while the machine guns had been
-attling and the artillery had kept up
i thunderous drumbeat which before
;his offensive would have been referred
.0 as a violent artillery duel.
The British put on Delville wood the
leaviest concentration of shell fire in
l given area ever directed against field
iortifications. Even the gunners were
imazed when they computed its voljme
per minute in preparing the way
or the infantry. Counting the front a
housand yards, there must have been
hree shells a minute falling on every
;ard.
The purpose was to leave nothing
>tanrl<n<T livincr Vr?t n fiinclA
ierman sniper in a tree, not a single
Jerman machine gun, but was to be
>ut out of business by the tornado of
>lasts. Delville wood has left Trone
vood with a tame reputation.
The British had nearly all the Delrille
wood after the advance of July
4. but the Germans got an enfilade mahine
gun and shell fire on them and
ook possession of the middle of the
vood and of the British dead, who had
ought to the last man. But the Brit?h
kept the southern end of the wood
nd the adjoining village of Longuevai
gainst repeated attacks, raking the
lermans with machine guns and shell
re.
When the British infantry advanced
hey did not expect to recover all the*
.odd, but before the charge had flnshed
they had taken all except about
n acre of the northern end. That was
aken today.
New Men Show Courage.
The troops engaged around Eongueal
and Del\glle wood, where the fightig
exceeds in ferocity for the possesion
of the valuable ground anything
et seen in the offensive, have been
oth hardened regulars and new army .
attalions. The new army men, fresh
rom the English drill grounds, when
ut into this "hell's crucible" have
tiown the same racial stubbornness
s the regulars.
"No shell fire could be worse than
ie way the teachers had pictured it
> us," said one of the new army men.
We were expecting it all?machine
uns, bombs, snipers, big shells and
ttle shells?and so we were not surrised."
The commander of one famous division
Id the men if they were good boys and
.ught well when they attacked July 14
iey would not be put permanently on
te* reserve, but would have another
lance in the offensive. They had a
eek of this uninterrupted orgy and
hen they cam" out to rest their comander
informed them they had made
>od and could go back. The dust-caked
terans cheered this announcement.
"How anybody comes out of Delville
ood alive is a miracle," said an officer
ho had been in the thick of the struge.
"But i know men who were bowled
rer Ave times by shells, knocked down
r branches of falling trees, whose
alps were cut with machine gun bults,
and yet came out."
This morning the British found there
hundred Germans, mostly with some
nd of wound, who had survived the
arfui bombardment, which left
