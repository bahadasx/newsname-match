Miss Mildred Scaife Relate
Thrilling Experiences in Mex
ico City?During the Bombard
ment Her Home was in tht
Line of Fire and Pieces o
Shell Flew in Her Window.

v/hiiujii vyiiruiucie.
Mr. Rowland E. Scaife and his sis
ter, Miss Mildred E. Scaife, arrivet
here from Mexico City last Thursday
and are visiting their brother, Mr. It
L. Scaife. With the exception of sev
eral short trips to the States the;
have been in Mexico throughout th<
various revolutions which have tori
up that country. During the ten day:
bombardment in Mexico City theii
home was in the line of fire and i
number of shells exploded over ant
around their home. Miss Scaife ha;
pieces of shell and shrapnel whicl
dew in the window a'nd fell on th?
floor of her room.
Mr. Scaife was formerly from Un
ion, where for aboat ten years hi
was the head bookkeeper of the Ex
celsior Knitting Mills. In 1907 he ac
cepted a responsible position in on<
of the largest banks in Mexico. Mr
Scaife is also a talented artist ant
during his stay in Mexico, his span
time has been devoted to art. Whei
conditions resulted in the paralyizatioi
of business, he remained to completi
some paintings of Mexican1 life 01
which he was working. It wa's hi:
intention to leave for Spain to de
vote his entire time to art when th<
European war started. His sketchei
of Mexico scenery have gained him i
reputation and a number of his paint
ings have gone abroad.
The Chronicle is indebted to Miss
Scaife for the following interesti'nf
article on the Mexican situation:
The need for positive action or
the part of the United States govern
ment in the case of Mexico, has nevei
been more acute than now. The grin
wolf of starvation is showing its teetl
again, and the writer knows of aeiw
i:3 eases where old people and young chil
' * dren sank down in the streets ol
Mexico City and died for want 01
bread. In normal times one dollar ir
Mexican monev is worth fiftv cent:
in ours. You can imagine the suffer
ing among the poor when a sack 01
flour is selling at $100.00; butter
$12.50 per pound; coffee and sugar
$4.00 and $5.00 per pound. When th<
Red Cross sent supplies they wer<
held up by Carranza. The most piti
ful sight I saw in Mexico was a grea
ciowd of little children passing aloiu
the street with little empty vessel:
crying for something to eat. Tin
"first chief," Carranza', when breat
riots and looting were going on an.
constructive statesmanship was re
quired, he was concerning hi'nisel
about such things as divorce laws anc
the upholding of the established law:
of the countrv and those in a"uthcrit\
under him, were directly to the cm
ployers that the wages of employee:
should he raised and that no aervani
at all should work 011 Sundays, ant
that work should not begin until J;:'h
a. m. and stop at 7 p. m. Th'-s, ol
course ,ca"used great discontent ant
paved the way for the numerous stri
bus strikes which followed.
Carranza's first arrival into Mex
ico City with his hordes of bandi'
soldiers was followed by a reign o;
terror. The homes of aristocrats ant
of the most wealthy Mexicans wer<
made targets of the revolutionary
spirit. Obregon, the post commander
gave carte blanche to his men to loo'
as much as they pleased with tht
promise that he would "not fire 1
shot," while many a private citizei
was shot and made a*n example of foi
petty thieving.
Ma*ny nights were made hideous by

the city, many innocent men beinj
killed because their political opinion:
differed. The rough, dirty soldier:
took possession of some of the most
elegant homes in the city for barracks
the unfortunate owners having fle<
the country since Diaz left.
The bandits carried off car loads ol
furniture. One house i'n particulai
was brought to our notice. The li
brary of this home was considered th<
finest in the city. The soldiers not
liking the polished floors, drove nail:
into them to insure safer walking, ant
seeing the library, threw the books ou
on the ground like rubbish, selling
many volumes of priceless value foi
25 Mexican cents, or 2 cents in oui
money. The officers installed them
selves in different elegant, privat<
homes, Carranza's choice being nota
bly beautiful, and the soldiers turnet
churches into stables.
Why should a dignified governmen
like ours treat with bandits Wbi
should it grasp a hand, if not person

party to it? It is impossible in i
short article to enumerate the horri

ONS IN MEXICO
ble happenings which are not and can
^ not be exaggerated.
One especially cruel act, which in
itself is enough to make the name of
L Carranza as much hated as Huerta's
is the following tragedy told us by
? one of the Mexican nurses who saw
, the mangled remains.
A certain prominent citizen, a former
cabinet officer, whose only crime
was that of belonging to the Diaz
regime, and of being the owner of
valuable property, was a'ccused of being
an enemy of the revolution. He
" was SDied unon and nut into nrisnn
to wait his trial. He was dying of
,r heart trouble, so his trial wa's has"
tened and he was condemned to be
" shot. As the hour of execution ap'
proached (the nurse told us that), very
" strong stimulants were given him, as
] they feared they would lose their
1 prey, and he must die like a common
1 criminal. As the squad of soldiers
| fired on him, he fell mortally wounded.
Then what is called "the shot of
s mercy" was given by a violent ex1
plosive just behind the ear. The
' whole face was shot away and what
remained of the head was an unrecog
nizable mass of utter destruction. His
- family had not been allowed to come
- near him during his confinement in
- prison and what was left of a once
2 brave and noble man, wa's the bloody,
crushed mass of flesh which his fam1
ily could see but were not allowed to
2 give decent burial. We were con">
stantly hearing the shots which were
1 taking the lives of those who had
2 opposed Carranza' and as an example
1 of the ruthlessness of the Carranza re3
gime, one day a beautiful young lady,
- as she passed in her automobile, was
2 taken as a target and killed by a Cars
ranza soldier. Yes, we, one and all,
i admit that Mr. Wilson's policy is a
- Christian, long-suffering one, and the
best Mexicans say so, too, but with
s us'declare that it is an utter failure
r when applied to ignorant Indians
whose hands are red with the blood
of their brothers as well as that of
i innocent, law-abiding foreigners.
- . l]he conditions are similar, although
r worse than those through which the
i South passed after the Civil war. Igi
norant, blood-thirsty Indians, are not
l4 ready. for democracy. They must be
. trained and educated up-to it; else its
f sacred teachings (like our flag at
f Vera Cruz), will be trampled under
i foot.
TKo 7Hft rofn irooe wUa nomo Aiif
with us, one and all, rejoiced to think
that we were hurried out for no other
cause than intervention, and to hear
that another agreement was being considered
with Carranza, the indignation
knew no bounds as Carranza
merely wants to better equip his army
with more machine guns and ammunition
to kill our soldiers when the final
conflict comes. He was gathering
nen and civilians were constantly
drilling when we left. One night we
heard the church bells ringing as a
signal to gather for an anti-American
demonstration. The mobs passed
by crying, "Mueren los Gringos," no
less cruel and bloody.
("Kill the Americans"). The hand of
Huerta, while stronger than that of
Carranza, was no less cruel a'nd
bloody.
It not only prolongs the agony of
?.Iexico, but delays the dawn of peace,
to believe that one revolutionary leader
is any better than another. Our
. own government representatives in
Mexico sneer t;t the Washington policy,
while carrying out instructions in
f a weak-hearted way.
f 11
is a well known fact that Amerij
can citizens receive less protection
, from their government than any other
* foreign nation represented in Mexico.
They are thrown i'n prison on the
? slightest pretext. Our flag is the
s least honored in Mexico, when it
[ should w&Ve the highest. Shall we let
our sister republic drink the cup of
r misery to the dregs, or do the kindest
thing that can be done?intervene and
raise to its feet, one of the fairest
f lands upon which the sun has ever
shone? Mildred E. Scaife.

The physicians of the city and coun- D
ty, with several yet to be heard from, P
have subscribed the sum of $'2,500.00 M
to the capital stock of the Wallace D
Thomson hospital, recently organized D
as a joint stock company. The members
of the committees have sub- D
scribed around $2,000.00 more. It is D
hoped that the mills of Union will subscribe
$2,500.00 more. This will give
quite a good start, so that when the ai
citizens are called upon, it should be te
an easy matter to get $4,000.00 more, sc
That would put the enterprise through st

A CARRIER PIGEON CATGUT.
Messrs. Thad Strange, C. H. Norman
and Chief Milo H. Evans caught
a carrier pigeon Wednesday.
On one leg he had two brass or gold
bands and on the other an aluminum
band. Upon this is inscribed the letters
"A. J., '14, No. 9841)."
Thf? nlinvp nnmpd urAnt.lpmen smw
the pigeon on the roof of the seed
house near the Eagle Grocery Go., and
caught it by scattering rice. The
bird came to eat. Mr. Strange will
keep the bird until he hears from the
owner, and will then turn it loose.
