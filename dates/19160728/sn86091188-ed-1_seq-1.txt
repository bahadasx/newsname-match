LEONARD SEES ENLARGED
USE FOR AUTOS ON RAILS
L. O. Leonard, promoter of tlie
Boise-Butte-Salmon railroad, is in
tlie city for a few days. He came in
Tuesday from Butte, accompanied by
Mrs. Leonard. Mr. Leonard lias
never given up hope that his railroad
dreams may come true and that lie
may see them realized within a verj
short time, witii the intermnuntain
country in direct steel rail connec
tion witii the Pacific coast at San
Francisco. His observations in ttie
valleys of tlie Salmon and Lemhi
rivers caused him to marvel at their
splendid appearance this year, tie
,inds front year to year steady im
provement on every hand- in large
ly increased flocks of sheep and in
better cattle and in improved slock
of all kinds: in' development of
mines and in improved farm methods.
In no distant future be predicts
unrivaled good roads in all this re
gion, witii bundled* of tourists front
every state in tlie union. Many of
the tourists w ill buy homes or make
their investments here. Then in
the wake of good roads for vehicle
use will come electric; systems or
transportation witii cars of this sort
all up and down across these valleys,
lie pred'cts that perhaps within a
year or two automobiles will lie in
general use not only on tlie good
roads for travel and tonnage hauls
hut on tlie railoads also in tlie form
ef motors 'or tlie same purpose
These, lie says, may be nothing more
than automobiles and automobile
tiucks supplied with flange wheels
but capable of wonderful usefulness
on tlie rails. Why should not tlie
tracks of railroads, which are used by
locomotives very little of the time,
lie put to profit by allowing Hie
motors to move over Item, or why
should uoi tiie railroad managers pro
vide tiie motor* thau.selves?

GROWING ASSOCIATION FOR
HIGHWAY IMPROVEMENT
Membership Start* With a Jump,
at a Dollar as the Fee —Body
To Take Hand in Highway Im
provement.
As a result of the campaign for
membership, started on Tuesday, in
Salmon, for the Central liood Roads
association, upward of
names were secured at

lee which all men of affairs con-'
xider not only a hounden duty to
plank down tut éRteeui it an honor
and a privilege to do so in a moat,
worthy cause. For this reason the
membership Is growing by leaps and
bounds. Every good citizen is be
hind tlie movement, either
patny or active affiliation.
It was two months ago that Roy
B. Herndon first broached the sub
ject of such an organization, having
enlisted tlie active support of tlie
in syin- 1
Business Men's association. A com
mitte** of this laaiy. through L, F.
Ramey, chairman, and Allen C.
Merritt, secretary, pushed forward j
tlie enterprise, until Charles A. Nor
ton was chosen iiermanent presiding
officer and Mr. Merritt secretary.
It was pointed out at tlie liegln- I
ning that tlie state and general
government, like providence, would
lend a helping hand only tu thus
who help themselves. And so tlie
idea of tills organlzti in took firm
hold after it had its beginning.
it lias come to stay and to work
out tlie solution of tiie transportation
problem. In many localities Miere

funds fur road Ini i id lug. It is more
than likely that the Central associa
tion will take action to tlie same end,
witii influence enough behind tlie as
sociation to insure tlie adoption of
that plan in this countv. other
communities ha*e given aporoval to
