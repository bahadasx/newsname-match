A slight delay was experienced this

the gravel from tho river fast enough
to supply tho demand two pumps havo
been in oporntion dally and It was
necessary to employ a night forco of
twelve men. Many aro of tho opinion
that only ono block should be worked
upon at ono tlmo nnd completed before
th eutliors aro dug up but Engineer
MoNnmnra states that aeveral blocks
can .bo worked upon to better advan
tage and will keep tho graders at work
at all times Instead of waiting for
their lino of work and it is bettor
that tho concroto bo thoroughly sot

blocks aro being paved at the present
time. Tho curbing on Locust and
stroots west has been comploted and
drain boxes aro being placed on
Fourth, Fifth and Sixth streets through
whiclL water will run from north and
south to tho east from openings In tho
pavement. Tho brick Is being Bhlppod
froinMurphy8boro, 111., nnd each car
contains 10,000 bricks,
This amount will only covor two
blocks, but tho rest hns boon ordored
so that It will nrrtvo as needed.
It takes about twonty men to run
the big concroto mixer and thoy expect
to concrete ono block a day. As soon
as tho base Is sufficiently sot, which
will tako a week or ten days, It will
be covered with a sand cushion ono
and ono-hnlf Inches deep. After this
Is rolled and brought to an even Bur
faco tho brick will then bo laid nnd tho

The traveling public must expect
some Inconvcnienco in a big undertak

aftor tho roork la finished, as wo
will be justly proud of our business
