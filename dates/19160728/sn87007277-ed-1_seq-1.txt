out 2G batters of the Texas Christian
University team. In a 14-inning game.
Manager Jennings took official notice
of the feat, watched Watson in prac

HARD PLACE TO PLAY
SHORTSTOP MOST DIFFICULT PO
SITION ON THE DIAMOND.
On Account of Long Throw Player
Must Make His Plays Quick and
Clean Third Base Is Easiest
Position to Play.
That shortstop is the most difficult
of the seven fielding positions tt play
Is the opinion of nil good judges
among baseball men.
The shortflelder has as many
chances as the second baseman,
und they are usually much more
difficult. While the guardian of the
second sack has oceans of time In
which to make his plays to first base
the short fielder, on account of the
much longer throw, must make h(s
plays os clean as a whistle. Plays to
his right are exceptionally difficult.
He has to cover a world of ground,
and he must follow up most of his
stops by n long nnd accurate throw.
He must do his share of touching run
ners at second base. In many cases,
ns in thnt of Bancroft of the Phillies,
he does practically all of the cover
ing of second base on thrown balls
to prevent stealing.
While all are agreed that short
stop is the most difficult place to
play In the infield there is not so
much unanimity about the easiest
place to play, opinion being divided
between this and second base.
The preponderance, however, is In
favor of third base, where chances
are less numerous, and where there
are only one or two difficult situa
tions that can arise. The third base
man's throw is not as a rule, so diffi
cult as that of the shortstop. He
plays rather close in, as a rule; gets
the ball quickly, and has more time
to get It away. The third baseman
has a hard time when there Is a man
on second bnse, with a batter up who
can either hit or bunt. The fielder
then does not know Just what Is com
ing off. U he plays back the batter
may lay down a bunt nnd bent It out.
Shortstop Bancroft
while If he plays too close up on the
grass a clever hitter is likely to slip
one past him for a clean hit But,
taking it all in all, the third base pluy
Is more mechanical than that at sec
ond and the number of chances to
be taken Is vastly less. Of the four
Infield positions it seems to be the
least difficult to cover provided a man
has the arm and the mechanical abil
ity. BROWNS CARRY BIG PAY ROLL
President Ball Says It Will Amount to
$133,000 Ta I ant Sent to Minors
Is Included.
President Ball of the St. Louis
Browns, is quoted as saying that his
pay roll for players this year will run
$138,000. This includes, presumably,
a lot of talent Bent to the minors, but
which the Browns are obliged to pay
part of the salaries on. Mr. Ball
thinks his pay roll larger than that
of any other club In the two majors,
and there Is absolutely no way for
him to reduce it much, since all con
tracts are ironclad.

New York. A man dressed In well
cut clothes limped into the Rocky
Mountain club. He was Capt. Morton
Webber of the Royal field artillery,
who 18 months ago bade good-by to
his club friends when he went off to
light for the British empire. Yester
day he was glad to be In a City of
peace, but nt the same time there
seemed to be a trace of sorrow now
and again in his demeanor, caused per
haps through his being physically in
capacitated and therefore for the time
being unable to rejoin his regiment
Captain Webber Is the type of sol
dier who dislikes to talk about what
he has seen. It was difficult to draw
from him details of his experiences at
the front In fact it was only through
a good friend of the British officer that
in his enthusiasm for Great Britain
he said something about the three
campaigns in which he had fought If
Captain Webber had had his own way
this story would have read ;
"First I got a commission. Then 1
went to Frnnce and afterward to Alex
andria, Gulllpoli and the Balkans.
Now I'm here."
Captain Webber is a consulting engi
neer, an expert on mine valuation. He
gave up a comfortable Income with
out an lota of regret to go to England.
That Ypres Salient.
"Ten days after 1 landed In Eng
lund," said Captuln Webber, "1 re
ceived a commission in the Royal field
artillery. Previous to that I had told
them that I was accustomed to han
dling men,' as I had been doing so for
about twelve years. I said that I was
giving up a good living and thut if they
did not want me 1 would stay for two
weeks in Devonshire und then return
to the United States.
"Then I went to France," he con
tinued. "I was laid out there at Hill
No. 60 on the Ypres salient"
Apparently this was final with Cap
tain Webber and I then said: "Tell
me what hnppcned."
"Oh, we practically got wiped out
It wns a bloody fight. One of the no
ticeable things about the fighting (and
there's no secret In telling this, be
cause I would not discuss anything of
military value) wns how much the op

up without the guns. Artillery do

Psychology of Battle.
"You see so much on the battlefield
that you are absolutely detached from
yourself, especially after you have lost
half your men. You can't realize that
U you are killed you are dead. Some
how or other you get to Imagine yon
are Immune, but you always have the
feeling, after you see one man and
then another drop, that you want to
tuke It 'out on the enemy. 1 was scup

dering. Rydul, Pa. Because of a "malign in
fluence created by another man who
IB always with me in spirit und dictates
all my actions," John Ward, age 70,
asserted he became a vagrant ten
years ago nnd has been one ever
since. All efforts to shake off the evil
spirit have been unavailing, and Ward,
who says he Is a Phlladelphlan, assert
ed be could not hold any job because
of his tormentor.
That's the story Ward told Magis
trate Wllllnras at the Abingdon sta
tion. He had gone to the Curtis coun
try place at Rydal and asked for some
thing to eat. Because the food given
hltn did not plense either his taste or
his fanof ho threw It away and created
nucha disturbance that members of the
family were frightened and telephoned

flank, we were forced to fall back on
Saloniki, nnd in the rear guurd actions

Again there was a finality te his

Outwitting Woman.
"You are very exacting," he said.
"But I do remember something about
a German spy. The spy was a woman.
She was a wonder as to looks and at
tire, nnd I was Introduced to her one
day in Alexandria. She was full of
thought for the British army. She
asked me to accept a lift In her auto
mobile. I did. At that time 1 had
our guns close to the yacht club to
train on the breakwater. The yacht
races were still going on every day
near the club and fashionably dressed
women with escorts frequented the
place. This woman often asked me to
tuke a ride in her automobile. She
could drive well and fast. Then one
day she surprised me.
" 'Where's your observation station
she asked.
"It was a question which would have
been unusual from a man who was not
in the army and about the last thing
for a woman to ask. As a matter of
fact the observation station was In a
lighthouse, but as I looked at her pret
ty eyes I lied and told her that It was
In the steeple of the English church.
After that I found that she did not
come aronnd to the club and I had no
more automobile rides. I was always
waiting for a four-inch submarine gun
to biff that church.
"We were going to be Interned, so
the Greeks told us, If we retired within
their gates. Perhaps we might have
been, except for the presence sudden
ly of ten British warships. They
cleared for action and after that there
was no more talk about interning us.

"On another occasion a spy In Sa

a bonfire. This was against orden
and at dawn we realized from the'
dropping of shells that the spy had
given the enemy our positions The en

waited for them and1 worked out their
position carefully, but could not ex

unexploded shell arrived It was set

Krupp firm. That night we waited un

We heard their ammunition boxes

more than anything else. It was a
giant kiltie. He must have been
champing at the bit before they let
him out of the trenches by the way
he went for the Germans. He was so
strong that he drove part of1 the barrel
of his gun, with the bayonet, Into one
of the enemy. He could not extricate
his gun. I then saw this- Scot reach
down and pick up the German's weap
on and with that he killed the man
who was seeking to averige the death
of the first German.
"That time, too, the bayonet went la
too far. Nothing loath, this brawny
kiltie grabbed a third man's gun.
A Discord of Fighting.
"We got a present of a piano for
our mess in Gallipoll. We did not get
much Of a chance to try it1 out, because
the first night It was tuned up for the
evening a high explosive shell swung

were continually picking up keys.
"It's hard to have any conception of
the amount of lead, iron and copper
that Is being shot into the ground and
which can't be recovered; An Idea of
this can be gathered when it Is real
ized that solely through allied buying,
copper has risen from a normal 13 and'
14 cents to 28 cents. And lead, which
has a normal price of 3 to 4 cents,
now is up to 8Vi cents. Remember
that Germany requires just as much as
the allies, which she Is unable to get
because of the British fleet and It's
only a question of time before she be
gins to feel the pinch,
"I should say that the greatest stra
tegical masterpiece of the war waa
that the allies had not tried; 'a Ver

that four Germans have been killed for
every Frenchman. The Germans are
bound to do something: for a moral ef
