Mount Hcnuon In Rovlew.
(Green field llocordor.)
'flip most impressive feature of the
celebration of the Il.'ith nnnivoisary of
the foiitidiun of the Mount llerniou
school for hoys was the presence of a
number of the early araduates who
have won prominence in the n (fairs of
the world. The only prominence that
tlie founder of tlie school believed was
worth while as based on service and
of such sort linvc been tho careers of
the men who asi hoys felt tho direct'
inilnenco of his presence nnd example.
KeeollectiniiH of Mr. Moody and his
devotion to the schools which were tlie
expression of his ripo thought and pur
pose are still fresh in the neighbor
hood which lie mnde world-famous. His
tremendous energy found its outlet in
the upbuilding of' tho schools nt North-

of the early morning driving of the
big dapple gray through the rpiiet old
street as tho evangolist made his way

The favorite conundrum of early Mount
Herman boys was " liy is Mr. .Moody
so good n man?" And its answer. "He
cause he drives so fast the devil can't
catch him." There was no idleness in

Hut Mount llernmu is not nil his
tory. Tho imnehis tlie founder gavo it
was not bounded by his own life. Its
purpose has been kept unimpaired and
what was done In tho enily days is he-
iag done now only :uoio extensively for
the boys that come within its energiz

lingers about the period when tho
school was housed in the farm build

practically it has "10r0 ow than over

Thomas Cave, jr., of Burro, who has
announced his ciindidnev for the olllce
of auditor of ncconnts, will bo handi
capped by tho fact that ho is not a
lawyer. A very important part of tho
work of tho auditor is dealing with the
department of justice, where a know
ledge of legal matter is ulinost indis
pensable. Wo do not recall a time in
10 years when u man not versed in law
has filled tho position.
Kfioits of the federal health service to
pi event, if possible, the spieadinL' of in-
lantile paralysis to cities and towns out
side of Xew York have been stiengtlieneil
by an older providing that no child 10
years old or under bo permitted to leave
Xew York without a ceitilieate from the
leileial Kiirueons. All niilioads leaving
tin; city mo co-operation with the federal
autlioiitips and no tickets arc sold unless
the icipiirod certificate is shown. This
seems to be a haul pinviim in so far as
those who wi.sh to take eliildien out of
the metiopolis nie eoncetneil, hut the ne
cessity lias aiisen to piotcct the lest of
the coimtiy from the (head disease.
The Louisiana purchase cost this
country $lfi,()()i),0()0f and it was an cm-
piro in itself, although at the time the
payment was made the itninenso tract
was undeveloped. We paid-only $7,200;
000 to Biish'ui for Aln9ko, which pays
for itself many tunes over nnd is still
the country of uncovered wealth. Tho
three little islands which we expect to nc-
ipum from Denmark nt a cost of $2.V
000,000 ure almost no value from
commercial standpoint, but they
are of great importance as strategic
positions in defending' tho Pannma
.canal, nnd their acquisition by nny na
tion with hostile intentions towards
America would he a calamitv. For what
we want of thoin thev are worth the
price. Negotiations for their possession
havo been attempted for years. Secre
tary of State Hay arranged for thoir
puTchase at a cost of littlo over $4,000,.
000, but tho Denmark parliament, under
the ellect of German influence, as is
supposed, refused to ratify the treaty.
The hay crop on farms in Jlrattlebooro
and vicinity is double that of last year.
Jn one town the claim is made that the
farmeis have an oppoitunity this year to
harvest more hay than in the three pre
vious bcasnns combined. The only trou
ble is that the growth is so luxuriant and
tho conditions so unfavorable that per
haps not all of the grass will be cut and
put away in the barns. Thoro is ono good
thing about hay. It is not necessary to
uso it tho season immediately after it is
cut. It will "cany over" better than al
most any other crop. We wonder whether
tho growth of glass this year makes any
of the fanners think of possibilities. We
get the immense growth because of the
heavy fall of rain. Hut what about irri
gation? Without thoir canals thousands
of funnels in western and southwestern
states would bo in a deplorable condition.
With many of them their lands, which
now tin n out valuable ciops each season,
would bo valueless. Hut what is tho mat
ter with it l igation in Xew Kngland? By
use of storage reservoirs and electric
pumps many acres which cannot bo do
ponded upon to givo ciops with any do
glee of ceitainty would blossom like the
rose every year. We know of some farms
within a few miles of this village that
could he ungated at n very small expense.
Hut no one has ovor had tho temerity to
try the experiment. About tlie only farm
ers in this pint of the country who havo
used the water supplies to keep their
ciopH iu giml condition nic the cucumber,
onion and tobacco groweis in certain
towns iu tho Connecticut valley in Massa
chusctts towns .10 to f0 miles south of
llrattleboio, nnd they employ the over
head system of pipes. Wo believe that
inigatioh, in one foim or another, could
be employed with gicat profit on thou
winds of acres iu Xew Kngland.

NOT AN EXPLANATION.
The Allen M. Fletcher Senatorial club
is indebted to cx-Gov. 13. C. Smith of St.
Albans nnd his St. Albans Daily Messen
ger for injecting into the senatorial cam
paign two subjects that might not other
wise have received attention. These sub
jects nic "native son'' lulo in holding
ollice and the absuid "mountain nile" in
selecting candidates. The only cditoiial
in the -Messenger of last Friday was de
voted to an explanation, which did not ex
plain, ex-flov. Smith's nddiess dehvcicd
at the meeting of the (iiciter Vermont
association held in Montpelier .July 12.
The cditoiial says the ex-governor's woids
were: '"Vermont should bo governed by
Vermonters, and I mean true Vermont
cis," nnd asks "What is tho matter with
that?" Theio is nothing the mutter with
such a statement, but a skilled reporter
took down the ox-governor's words as
follows; "I want to say that I behove
our high offices iu Vermont should bo
kept for" Vermonters," and a further
statement: "Thcie is not a state in the
I'liion that would toleiato the introduc
tion of outsidei-K to its high olliccs."
The above questions weie ill no way re
fen ed to in the cditoiial explanation that
appeared in The Messenger. Thciefoic
tho cditoiial explanation failed to ex
plain. Tlie Messenger should be given an
other oppoitunity. We await it Per
haps ex (!ov. Smith didn't know what he
said. When he was governor he made
about as difficult work of trying to say
something ns any man we have ever heaid
in public life.
And talking about this "native son"
claiui, int it tine that about o0 per cent
of all the members of the United States
senate today weie Ihiiii outside the states
they now lepiesent in the upper branch
of congiess?
Here are some eloquent figures i elating
to the number of automobiles and the
amount paid by them for the woik of
maintaining highways: In the United
States theio is one automobile to 41 per
sons; iu Vermont ono to 23. The per
capita number of automobiles in Ver
mont is exceeded by only two states, Cali
fornia, one to 17 and Iiiwn, one to 10. In
the United -States the average amount of
license paid by automobiles is $7.40 while
in Vermont it, is ?18,0, the highest
imount of any state. In the majority of
states, however, automobiles are subject
to local taxation, besides the state license
fee. The (iguies ale decidedly -ci editable
to Vermont.
Time is flying nnd somo persons who
wish to got into tho political cam
paign in this year of primaries will
find themselves marooned if they don't
watch nut. Tho state primary will be
held Sept. 12. All nominations for
state, congressional and county officers
must be filed 21 days before the state
primary. That means that nil nomina
tions for offices that appear on the son-
ate, congressional and county tickets
must be filed before August 22. The
filing for stnto and congressional offices
must be with the secretary of state,
for county officers with the county
dork nail for town representative with
the town clerk. The time for tiling the
town representative nominations is 14
days before the prfinnry, or on or be
fore August 2S. There was never a
year when there seemed to he u denrth
of candidates for town representative
in Southern erinont ns at present.
But men willing to serve tho stnto ns
legislators will doubtless declare them
selves in the next month.
TRAPPED IN TUNNEL.
Torriblo Disastor in Which About 30
Men Lost Tholr Lives Near Cleve
land, Ohio.
A terrible disaster took place iu Hnke
Krie, flvo miles from tho shore nt Cleve
land Monday night, when 22 men were
killed nnd half a dozen others fatally
injured by tho explosion. It is thought
that tho electric apparatus ignited nat
ural gas which had escaped in the big
wnter works channel where two or three
other serious accidents hnvo occurred
within the past two years. Tho first
explosion killed 11 men. Seven went to
their rescue and four of those perishod.
Six out of a second rescue party of 11
aiso lost their lives.
MURDER IN SECOND DEGREE.
Otis Williams Convicted of Killing
Joseph Folch of Waits Rlvor Last
April.
Otis Williams, n young farm hand,
charged with tho murder of Joseph
Folch in tho hitter's sugar house near
Walts River last April, was yesterday
pronounced guilty of murder iu tho sec
ond degree, by tho jury, which roported
nt D.lfi. Folch was killed by a rifle bul
let. Tho testimony tended to show that
Williams was infatuated with Mrs.
Folch ami that the couple desired to got
Folch out of tho way. It is not ox
jiected that Mrs. Folch will bo tried
nt this term of court.

Mr. Kellogg enme h"ro from l'onltnoy.
He will go to St. John's church, Ports

ceived three calls since being in Brat
tleboro. It is n much larger field with
greater opportunities.
Since coming to Brattleboro Hew
Mr. Kellogg has seen the number of
active communicants of the church
greatly increased as well as tho average
attendance nt the services. Not only hns
he been active in the spiritual welfare
of his parishioners, but he hns succeeded
in placing the church on a better finan
cial footing than it has been in years.
His departure will be greatly regret

STRONGHOLDS CAPTURED.
Important Gains Made This Week by
the British and Russian Forco3 on
Two Fronts.
The most important development of the
last week ending two years of thp Kuro
pean war has been the occupation by the
Htitish of the village of Pozieies. The im
portance of this position lies iu the fact
that it ovei looks the plateau on which the
Ciennan lines extend to the eastward for
ninny miles. Some of the most stubborn
fighting which has occurred in the war
took place before the British weie iu com
plete possession, ns it was necessary to
take each house spparatply, so strongly
had' the fiernian foitilientions been made.
At the other points on the western front
Uio repot ts generally have been in favor
of the allies and the Germans have been
unable to make nny advance at Verdun,
about the only spot where they are at
tempting anything like an offensive.
The Hussians continue their victorious
advance and in the Galieian country havo
made impoitant gains and eaptuied thou
sands of prisonets. In addition they have
diiven the Tmks entiiely out of Aimenia
and have taken possession of Kringan,
which contained large bariaeks and mili
tary factories.
Interest on this side of the water has
entered jn the merchant submarine
Deutschlnml, which has been loaded nt
llaltimoie for her ictiirn tiiji. English
and Fieneh wat ships are patrolling the
coast just outside the Chesapeake Bay.
The arrival of the Deutschland's sister
ship, Bteiuen, has been expected daily at
(nine Atlantic port, but nothing has been
hoard from her since she started on her
'journey from Heligoland.

Xo clashes between the Americans
