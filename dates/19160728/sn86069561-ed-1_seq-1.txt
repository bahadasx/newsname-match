will be pulled off. and from read
ing the fair catalog, and what we
can gather, it promises to be the
best fair yet, and we believe every
body that can should attend their
courity fair, for it gives us a chance
to meet old friends and acquain
tances, perhaps that we have not

home coming. We think Livings

Squire Arnold left Livingston to
day for the Madison and Rockcas
tie county line. Madison county
has made a poposition that they
would meet Rockcastle county at
the line Thursday, with forty or
fifty men to do a dajs work on the
road, if Rockcastle would do like
wise. Hence Squire Arnold went
to meet them. People are getting
iu earnest about this road business
and the county officials are taking
the lead. Something is sure doing
in this line. Mr. and Mrs. Cot
tongitn were iu Berea a few days
this week to see Mr. Cottongim's
brother. Judge Mahlon Sum
mers was in Bond, Ky., Wednes
day, on business T J. Penning
ton was here Sunday. We cant
say he was here on business, for
it was Sunday. The truth of the
matter, we believe his mind re
verts back to the days spent in
our city. When Mt. Vernon gets
water works, as they already have J
electric lights, and we all net the
pikes, and Livingston gets street
cars, wont we be going some.

RESOLUTIONS.
Livingston Council No. 167.
Juniou Order United American
Mechanics.
We pause in our daily battle of
life, with its many trials, tribu
lations, joys and sorrows, to drop
a tear for and pay our respects to
our departed orotner, James
Henry Clark, who gently passed
over to the other side on Thurs
day Evening June, the 22nd.
i9i6., He was 3g years old and
had only been in our circle since
March 18th. I9I6. Therefore be it
Resolved, that in his death the
Council has lost a faithful, true
and loyal brother, tbe community
a kind neighbor, his companion a
true faithful and loving husband,
and his three children a loving,
kind and Christian father.
Resolved, that we know none
but those who have sat in the
shadow of such a great bereave
ment can justly weigh such a sor
row as this; those who have stood
by the side of loved ones, as hope
after hope dropped away, as the
pedals fall from a fading flower,
know that such anguish connot
find solace in our tenderest words.
Resolved that we bow to the
will of an unerring God, aud
since our brother cannot come
back to us, we, through the
merits of Christ, can go to him
and clasp anew the hand of
friendship and brotherly love in
the celestial garden in the border
land, where the flowers of love
and friendship are ever abloom,
bathed in eternal light, and
nourished by the waters of life
that flows from under the throne
of God; be it further Resolved,
that a copy of these resolutions be
sent to the family ot our
deceased brother, a copy spread
upou the records of our Council,
.and a copy be printed in tbe
0bunty paper, The Mount Ver
non Signal.
