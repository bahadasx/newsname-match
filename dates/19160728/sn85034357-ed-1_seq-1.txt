ple Present at Services?
Body Reached Here on
Special Train Sunday ?
Tho funeral and burial of George
W. Litz, whose death was mentioned
in the last issue of the News, occurred
here last Sunday afternoon. The funer?
al services occurred at the home of
A. Z. Litz in this town; the burial
took place in the new cemetery.
The body arrived here Sunday
morning on a special train from St.
Paul. The funeral party left Gas
tonia, N. C, early Friday morning, and
on account of the recent floods in
North Carolina and the washing out of
many railroad bridges, the party was
compelled to travel several hundred
miles off of a direct route to reach
Tazewell. The special reached the
Tazewell station at 3:15 Sunday morn?
ing, and was met. by a dozen or more
automobiles. Upon the request of
Mrs. George Litz the body was remov?
ed from the baggage car and taken
to the home of Mr. A. Z. Litz. In
the party, besides Mrs. Litz and her
young daughter, were her father and
mother, Mr. and Mrs. Wakefield, of
Ashland, Ky.. the brothers and sisters
of the deceased. Judge James French
Strother, of Welch, and J. Powell
Royall, of this town, who made a spec?
ial trip to St. Paul lo meet the parly.
A number of the passengers on the
special remained in their berths until
Inter in the morning.
The funeral services at the home of
tho brother of the deceased, A. Z.
Litz, were held at 2 o'clock, and it is
estimated that there were from 1200
to 1500 people present. The Rev.
W. W. Arrowood, of the Presbyterian
church, was in charge of the service,
assisted by Rev. Mr. Clark, of Grundv
and Rev. R. 13. Platt, jr., of Tazewell.
Mr. Clark had been associated with
the deceased in religious work at
Grundy, and spoke feelingly of their
association, and recounted may of the
good deeds performed by the dead man
who was one of the main supports
of the church at Grundy. The speak?
er stated that hie had lost one of the
best friends he had ever had and that
the cause he represented had suffer?
ed irreparable loss. Mr. Arrowood,
who also knew personally of the bene?
factions of Mr. Litz. paid him a beau?
tiful and touching tribute. After a
duet by Mrs. Sheb Gillespie, of North
fork and Mrs. C. W. Steele, of Taze?
well, prayer was offered by Rev. Mr.
Platt, after which the Masonic fra?
ternity took charge of the remains
und concluded the services at the
grave.
Tho burial service was under the
direction of the Tazewell Lodge,
assisted by members of the frater?
nity from Welch, Grundy, Borwind,
Iaegcr, and other points in the coun?
ty. . . ..
Clinch Valley Commandery, of this
town, acted as escort to the Masonic
body. The line of march was formed
at the Litz home and it is stated there
wore 112 automobiles in the proces?
sion, not counting a number of car?
riages. On arriving at the grave the
usual ceremony was followed. The
solemnity of the ceremony was great?
ly interfered with by a heavy down?
pour of rain.
The largest and most profuse floral
tribute soon in Tazewell was displayed
nt the burial. There were beautiful
designs of wreathes, crosses, crowns,
etc., the perfection of the florists art,
and a silent tribute that spoke louder
than words of the affection and es?
teem of absent friends.
In tho large crowd that attended
the funeral and burial here were many
men from the works of the W. M.
Ritter Lumber Company, in Buchanan
county. A special train was rim
from Grundy to the Norfolk and
Western connection at Devon to. ac?
commodate the large number of citi?
zens of Buchanan who wanted to come
to the funeral. A traveling man re?
turning here from the lumber camps
in Buchanan said that the announce?
ment of the death of Mr. Litz was re?
ceived at the various works of the
Company with the profoundest sor?
row. The laborers came down out
of the mountains and off the lumber
piles, and out of the saw mills and in
silent groups mourned the passing of
their friend.
A Friend to the Last.
A striking example of true friend?
ship was exhibited by Judge James
French St.rotVier, of Welch, who was
intimately associated with Mr. Litz for
years. The Judge was among the
first to reach the bedside of the dying
man nt Gastonin, N. C, and whsn
death had released the sufferer froni
the pangs of pain, and the long trip
to Tazewell begun, Mrs. Litz charged
the friend of her husband to "stay
with George Litz." as she always call?
ed him, and Judge Strother obeyed
that solemn request, and through
sleepless nights he stood guard over
the remains of his friend until the
body was safely borne to his native
county and deposited beneath the sod
to await the final summons. The af?
fection of Judge Strothcr for George
Litz was such that only death could
break the ties that bound them.

The following pall-bearers were se?
lected for the burial:
R.-R. Smith, C. K. Griner, and W.

JUST PASSING BY.
(Gate City Herald.)
Since your humble servant has bad
time to meditate ami to reflect and to
give you the results, manv months
have gone by ami the world has chang?
ed from the pursuits of peace to the
pursuits of war and the things that
make for war. The loss of life has
been awful. The loss of property has
been great. There is yet a story that
is to be told. It is the story of the
suffering of the widows and the
orphans. It is an appeal that
touches and will touch us all. We may
now lose sight of the real sorrow of
the war. in our partizanship for the
one side or the other, in our enchant?
ment, or attraction by the bigness of
the war, its great equipment and
the skill of the fighters and in the
panoramic view of the immenseness
of the scene.
Our attention is often drawn from
the realities of life, and the real facts
of life, by the dazzing players on
the stage of life. We look at the
panorama and we do not s so the
real facts which make it up. We
simply take a glimps; while we are
"Just. Passing By."
A speaker in our town, s> IKOthitlg
over a month ago, said in substance'
"Our country lias so far stemmed
the tide and we are still at. peace
For my part I believe pea. ; will
continue and that we can exclaim
with the Prophet of old, 'How beau?
tiful upon the mountain arc the feet
of him who bringeth glad t'.dings
who published peace!' And today
notwithstanding the great thimor
for war on the part of many people,
the nobler, tile truer influence for
peace has prevailed and wo arc
still at peace.
To quote again the speaker refer?
red to. If we would only realize that
we were created to b builders, and
not destroyers; builders of character,
builders of lives, of individuals, of
communities, of nations, and not de?
stroyers thereof, our vision ami our
ideal of life and of the future would
be such as to perpetuate peace. The
tear of the widow would mean more
to us than the dollar of the foreign
investor, and the wail of the orphan
more than the boasted "honor cry"
of the adventurer. There is more
honor in fair dealing than in fight?
ing. This is the lesson that our
President and these United Slates
arc trying to teach the world. Hon?
orable dealing among men an d na?
tions commands more respect than
a galling gun. We ought to feel
proud that we i re at peace, and
while we arc "Just Passing By," we
ought to be proud of an opportunity
to show by our lives that life is
worth living. Life is more than
mere existence. It is more than
the roarof cannon or the flash of
tlie sword. Life is given us to do
something good and to accomplish
something for ourselves and for our
fellowmnn. The end to be accom?
plished is Happiness No true man
can be happy when bis fcllow-ereat
ures around are in want or are de?
stroying them selves.
Let us remember, that with each
setting sun, we are one day nearer
the end. Our time is "Just Passing
By." And remembering, can you
not your neighbor, but you, realize
that you are a builder, and build for
yourself and your community a
character, a life that is worth while?
Peace will come when we cease to
destroy and begin to build.

VIRGINIA, FRIDAY, JULY 28,
SUPPORTED BY ACTIONS
OF FORMEH^PRESIDENTS
Wilson Following in Foot Stops
of Men Who Settled Difficul?
ties by Negotiations Rather
Than War.
For the information of those who
are not familiar with the arts of the
former Presidents of the United
States in averting war with other na?
tions by displomatic negotiations, wo
reprint below that portion of Martin
Glynn's speech in the St. Louis con?
vention dealing with the matter:
How Stands the Record?
The issue, raised by our opponents,
of the vigor with which our neutrali?
ty has been enforced is a comparative
issue which can be decided only by
comparative results.
And what are the comparative re?
sults? llow stands the record of this
administration compared with other
administrations?
When Grant Was President.
When Grant was President, during
the war between Spain and the Span?
ish West Indies, a Spanish minimal
seized the Vessel Virginius, Hying
the American flag, and a Spanish com?
mandant in cold blood shot the cap?
tain of the Virginius, llti of the crew
and lt> of the passengers.
Hut we did not go to war. Grant
settled our troubles by negotiations,
just as the President of the United
States is trying to do today.
When Harrison Was President.
When Benjamin Harrisson was
President the people of Chile conceiv?
ed a violent dislike to the United
Suites for our insistence upon neu?
trality during the Chilean revolution.
When this feeling was at its height
one junior officer from the United
States warship Baltimore was killed
outright in the streets of Valparaiso
and Hi of our sailors wounded, of
whom one afterwards died. In a mes?
sage to Congress on .January 25,
1892, supported by Secretary of State
James C. Blain and o neviuenco sub?
mitted by "Fighting Bob" F.vaus and
Winfield Scott Schley President Har?
rison said Ibis assault on our honor
"had its origin in the hostility to
these men as sailors of the United
SUiles wearing the uniform of the
Government, and not in any individ?
ual act of personal animosity," and
that Ibis nation "must take notice of
the event as an infraction of its
rights and dignify," ami as an inva?
sion of its "international rights."
But we didn't go to war. Har?
rison settled uur troubles by nego?
tiation, just as the President of the
United Slates is trying to do today.
When Lincula Was President.
When Lincoln was President this
country's rights were violated on ev?
ery side. England, Russia, Fiance
and Spain were guilty of such fla?
grant violations that SecreUuy of
SUlte Seward advanced a plan to go
to war with all of them at one and
the same time.
France used every possible in?
fluence short of open war to injure
us. She not only permitted the build?
ing of Confederate vessels in private
shipyards, but she allowed at least
two to be built in the national navy
yard of France, and she supplied
them with supplies from her Govern?
ment arsenal.
And England did more.
Through his Secretary of State,
Lincoln culled England to account for
the seizure of the U. S. S. Chesapeake
on the high seas bound from New
York to Portland, for the burning of
the U. S. S. Roanokc oil- Bermuda, for
the seizure on Lake Erie of the ship
Philo Parsons and the scuttling of the
Island Queen, the shooting of its en?
gineer, and the wounding of its pas?
sengers; and he protested to England
against the invasion of the territory
of the United Suites by a band of
southern sympathizers from Canada,
who rode across the border into Ver?
mont, burned a portion of St. Albans,
looted its homes, robbed its bank of
$211,000, killed one of its citizens, and
wounded several more. In stinging
language he told England that she
violated neutrality by permitting the
use of British ports and British bor?
ders as a base for felonious depnrada
tions against the citizens of the Unit?
ed States, and he wrote into history
his dirplomatic bnttle against Eng?
land for letting loose the Alabama to
prey upon our commenrce, to destroy
$100,000,000 worth of property, to
capture 84 of our vessels, and drive
our flag from off the seas. No na?
tion ever inflicted upon another na?
tion a more damnable or more mad?
dening wronf than England inflicted
upon the United SUites in the Ala?
bama outrage.
But we didn't go to war. Lincoln
settled our troubles by negotiations,
just as the President is doing today.
When Pierce Was President.
When Pierce was President the
British minister in this country violat?
ed our neutrality during the Crimean
War. We gave these representatives
of Great Britain their passoprts, and
sent them home.
But we didn't go to war. Pierce
settled our troubles by negotiation,
just a stbe President of the United
States is trying to do today.
When Van Buren Was President.
When Van Buren was President a
detachment of Canadian militia, dur?
ing the internal troubles in Canada,
boarded the U. S. S. Carolina in the
American wnters of Niagara River,
killed an Amerienn member of the
crew, fired the ship and sent her adrift
over Niagara Falls.
But we didn't go to war. Van Bur
en settled our troubles by negotia?
tions, just as the President of the
United States is trying to do today.
When Jefferson Was President.
When Jefferson was President Eng?
land seized hundreds of our ships
and Napoleon hundreds more. From
179.T to 1807 historians say England
and France together captured 1,(!00
American vessels and $000,000,000 in
Amerienn property. England com?
pelled over 2,000 American seamen to
serve against their will in the English
191?.
navy, and Napoleon ordered the seiz?
ure and confiscation of American ships
wherever found. Our shipping rotted
tit every Kreuel? and British port, our
crews were rust into prison and left
to die of abuse und neglect The brit?
ish ship Leopard tired upon the Amer?
ican cruiser Chesapeake in American
waters, killed and wounded several of
our sailors, took three native born
Americans oil' the Chesapeake, ami
hanged one of them in Halifax.
Hut we didn't go to wur.. Jefferson
settled our troubles by negotiation
just as the President ?f the United
States is trying to do today.
When Adams Was President.
When Adams was President Prance
preyed upon our commerce. She ex?
tended her seizure, sen relies, and con?
fiscations to the very waters of the
United States themselves until she
had pileil up in our Stale Depart?
ment charges of over 2,300 violations
of neutrality's law. American am?
bassadors who sought, to adjua these
wrongs were refused recognition and
openly insulted at. the French court
President Washington called Wash
illglon out of retirement to head the
Army, he created the Navy depart
mcnt and he built 12 battleships.
But we didn't go to war. Adam
settled our troubles by negotiation
just as the President of the United
Stales is trying to do today.
When Washington Was President.
When Washington was President
and, "neutrality" first declared, war
convulsed Europe, our ships laved not
put out (o sea, commerce was paralyz?
ed, and business depressed. Ameri?
can pnasongers ami American crews
were thown into prison and depriv?
ed of legal rights. Genet, the min?
ister from Prance, lilted nut priva?
teers in our harbors, (touted our of
lieiuls, anil tried to rally this country
to the support of France in return
for the help Franco gave us ill the
revolutionary war. England und
Franco seized KM) of our ships and
confiscated millions of dollars worth
of property and up in Quebec Lord
Dorchester promised Canadian Indians
the pleasure of burning American
homes und scalping American cili
sens.
But we didn't go to war. Wash?
ington settled our troubles by negotia?
tion just us the President of (he
United States is trying to do today.
Are Republicans Willing to Itead
Harrison, and Maine, Lincoln and
(.rant out of their party?
In the face of this record do It'1
publicans realize thai, when they ar
rnign the policy of the President of
the United States today they arraign
the policy of IInrrisson, of Bhline,
of Lincoln, and of Grant? For the
pleasure of criticising a Democratic
President, are they willing to read
out of the Republican parly the great?
est men the Republican parly ever
had? Are they willing to si.y that
the Republican party of today con?
demns what Hamilton did in revolu?
tionary days, what. Lincoln did in Civ?
il War days, ami what Grant, and
Dlain and Harrison did but yesterday?
In this policy of peaceful negotia?
tions today the President, of the Unit?
ed Slates follows the example set him
by the greatest Presidents the Dem?
ocratic party and the greatest Presi?
dents the Republican party oxer gave
the nation.
Do the critics'of the present admin?
istration believe that Lincoln should
have risked national disaster by us?
ing the sword rather than the pen in
pressing the Alabama claims? Are
they willing to brand Grant, as a cow?
ard because he kept us at peace with
Spain ?
Yet no Incident of the present war
shows so gross u violation of our neu?
tral right s as England's net ion in
building a navy to prey upon our com?
merce, no submarine attack surpass
es in horror the butchery of Ameri?
can citizens by that Spanish firing
squad in Santiago when Grant was in
the Presidentini chair.
In this, as in all tin- other big qucs
lions of life, the more we understand
tile past the belter we shall judge
the present. Where it took ten years
to secure adequate compensation for
the Alabama claim, the present ad?
ministration has already secured in
the case of a single claimant repara?
tion greater than all the Alabama
claims combined. Where, in other ad?
ministrations during great, foreign
wars, the. American ting was merely
an invitation to plunder, today thai
(lag is the best protection of all who
desire to be safe upon the seas.
Where Wushington vainly pleaded
for recognition of our neutral rights,
where Jefferson sought in vain to pro?
tect our shipping, when- Lincoln fail?
ed to gain us the freedom of Die seas,
the man who now sits in the Presiden?
tial chair has secured from every
warring power, from every Empire
under the sun the formal and definite
assurance that the neutral rights of
America shall be respected and ob?
served.
We challenge our critics to deny a
single fact in record. We defy them
to show a single point at. which the
helsmnn who has safely piloted us
through Europe's storm has depart?
ed from the course laid down by those
who established America's foreign
polic.
(NOTE?Further quotations from
the great speech of Mr. Glynn will be
published from time to time.)

Trouble May be Brewing-.
(Communicated.)
Pocahontas, Va., Julv 26.? For somo
I inn- rumors hnvc Ik-cm Hying thick
und fast, that Pocahontas is u wide
open town, and that liquor was being
sold illegally, also thai, gambling Wua
going on. These rumors found their
way into print, several paper, re?
ferring to the matter. Last wuck's
Clinch Valley News contained a col?
umn on the subject, which included the
correspondence between the editor und
the Commonwealths Attorney; It
has been charged that liquor waa sold
over the counter ami otherwise, ami
that one could get. any reasonable
quantity desired.
While these rumors were going the
rounds I'ocahontllH people are aware
of the fact that, quantities of the slul!"
nmu and go. The express office has
been doing a thriving business, and
lots of il is unloaded ami delivered to
points in town. Those who do not in?
dulge in the article do not observe any
selling by the drink or by the bottle,
though il is rumored that this kind
I of traffic has also boon going on.Thura
possibly some question about its
being sold by the drink.
While il. has been generally known
that liquor was being sold it. has
nevertheless been more or less dif?
ficult for the ollicers to get evidence
iMinvicl. The olllcei'S have also been
handicapped, (hey say by just one
thing, lhal is so needful in execut?
ing the law, and (hat is public senti?
ment. There was considerable ir
linu on the part of the ones eil
gllgod in the business, us well as their
friends, over (he loss of their business
six months abend of schedule time.
I This irritation extended pretty gen?
erally among the dealers ami busi?
ness men as well as members of the
council, as the town was deprived of
about $12,000 revenue. There was,
therefore, an under current of sym?
pathy with the dealers, and a feeling
Hint they had not I. treated right,
which had the elfecl, so far as thu
mayor and police force were concern?
ed, of making il. difllcilll for them to
cany out. the provisions of the law,
with regard to prohibition.
The result, it. thai, questions hava
been uskcd by many citizens as to
why the law was not enforced from
the beginning, or failing in thai why
was the illegal traffic allowed to con?
tinue. The members of tin- police
force claim I hey have done thu
best they could under the the circum
slances, in view of the conditions ex?
isting us above enumerated. Thd
police force also claim that the action
of the council in again opening church
street, has been hindrance to them
in keeping I he town clean. Otherwise
Hllloon keepers llHVO lime and again
pointed In the conditions thill, ex?
ist ami ask why (be town should not
have had a revenue if the business is
to continue. There is also a sprinkl?
ing of men who are inclined to go
slow in the matter of law enforce?
ment, nut. withillg to "kill the town
dead, by closing down the lid." There
is also an element of men who feel
like nothing much can be done until
November I. and things can drift,
lloilg about as they are until after
November.
Anyway, it. seems that, the police
have not neon altogether idle. Sev?
eral arrests have been made from
lime to lime and different ones have
n lined. Hut. the evil has not been
sloped, anil the ollicers have come to
the conclusion it. is about time to see
who's who. They have had some as?
surance which have given them un
ouragemeiil. The letter of the com?
monwealth's attorney last week has
caused them to realize afresh that the
power and dignity of the common?
wealth is behind them, and woe be?
tide lh man, be be white or black,
who wilfully volutes the law. While
it is true that, there were a number
here who wen- not in favor of the
losing down of the saloons until thu
fust of November, the commonwealth
of Virginia, through its legislature,
declared that Pocilhonlas should bu
under prohibition on May I, and that
should settle the mailer for all law
abiding citizens.
Il Lncrcfroe behooves every man
who has the best interests of thu com?
munity at heart to stand by the of?
ficers in their effort to uphold the
law. The ollicers feel thai with an
interested and determined people be?
hind them they can break up the il?
legal traffic Pocahontas people are
law abiding, partiolic and public spir?
ited, and while they are not much
for getting in the limelight or mak?
ing a noise they do a lot of good
thinking and reasoning, ami they have
enough civic pride and patriotism to
want to see the law respected and
enforced. That is what they elected
their officers for, and they have a
right to expect them to do it. That
is what they elected their councilmcn
for, U> wisely administer the affair,
of the town, and assist the officers in
the enforcement of the ordinances.
They have taken an oath to uphold
the law, and it is incumbent upon
them to do their duty. If they have
nol the back-bone to proceed they
should resign before the operation of
the ouster law relieves them of thoir
office. - .,
This is not intended as u reflection
on our ollicers, hut rather as an in?
centive to our citizens to riss to ths
responsibilities of citizenship nnd to
stand by their ollicers. Our officers
have shown that they arc men of
courage, and are nol afraid of any?
body. , ,
A preliminary skirmish took place
Sunday morning, when Sergeant G.
W Mays obtained an entrance into
a room over Smith and Rrnnson's
pool room and arrested four negroes
who were gambling. Although alono,
he took them all to police court. Whila
William Smith, colored, who is one of
the lessees of the building, was rath?

of the officer, nnd the latter attacked
him. Two or three other colored

in a rather defiant manner, but final
