Situation The UoUia Bill Far in
ert Need Org aniiation The Co
operative Principle.
By Myron T. Herrick.
When Mr. Herrick was in Fulton
county last week the editor ot the Tri
bune suggested t him that a con
siderable number of the citizens ox
this county were interested in the
question of Rural Credits, and know
ing that Mr. Herrick had maue a
thorough study of the Rural Credits
system of Europe and that he is also
thoroughly conversant with conditions
which obtain in this country, we asked
him for a statement of his views on
this important question. Mr. Herrick
veiy kindly gave us the following for
'publication:
A generation ago, if farm lad was
blight and intelligent his parents us
ually thought he was born for city life
and they strove to give him literary
or professional education or an oppor
tunity in some other way to use his
energies and abilities in the city. ,
The country was drained of its tal
ent for the benefit ef the city. The
recruits thua gained for commerce, in
dustry, and all kinds of city activity
have played an important . part in
making taw nation great and prosper
ous. And it is to be hoped that the
tttiet wiU continue to be supplied with
brain and brawn from the farm. City
liX would become decadent if it were
not constantly renewed ' and streng
thened from that source.
But during recent years the indus
trial army of the cities has been
growing more rapidly than some other
elements of our population, and not
infrequently it has suffered from the
lack of an adequate and regular supply
of raw material for feeding and cloth
ing it and for keeping it at work.
As a result, the costs of living have
become higher; and in this industrial
army the terms of enlistment are not
as easy nor the chances of promotion
as good as formerly. Life in the city
is not as alluring as once it was. The
farm lad has begun to realize this.
Moreover, the people in town and in
country are gaining a new apprecia
tion of the fact that agricujture is the
mainstay of thenatien's prosperityand
that it cannot be neglected without

They j
sources are so great that their de
velopment offers magnificent oppor
tumties for youth, energy, and intelli
genua, while it would solve the most
acute problems respecting the costs of
living. . '
So the cityward drift from the coun
try baa been checked to noticeable ex
tent. The students . in agricultural
colleges are yearly becoming more
numerous. Agriculture ia being look
ed on as a pursuit, calling for educa
tion at well as intelligence, and so it
t branches more seriously thin ever I of
before, with a view of solving its ownjf
is being studied and discussed in all
particular problems and of restoring
ihe balance between supply and de-
Una whi,w ... disturbed hv the
rapid advance of modern civilization.
This study hat evolved two lines of
thought. One is based on the idea that
the farmers are not able to take care
of themselves and manage their own
affairs. So it advocates the interven
tion of Government, the granting of
financial assistance by Government,
and the regulation and even the con
trol of agriculture through centraliz
ing agencies of Government at Wash
ington. The other line of thought it based
on the idea that the farmers are ca
pable and self-reliant, and that they
do not need Government aid or special
favors, that they are not seeking to be
set aside as a privileged class to be
assisted at the expense of the rest of
the taxpayers or made wards of Gov
ernment, "ke Indians, or pampered
from political motives. It believes
that the farmers simply want a square
deal and the enactment of laws which
will assure them equality with work
ers in other industries and enable
them to utilize their credit and re
sources to best advantage and obtain
adequate returns for the money, time
and labor risked m agriculture.
The rural credits .. movement was
these objects; to make available for
started a few years ago to carry out
all the needs of agncuiture tne stu
pendous aggregate wealth and re
sources of the farmers, to that farm
ers would be able to borrow money on
the easiest conditions at long term for
the purchase or improvement f f armt
or at short term for growing and mar
keting their crops.
But the movement hat been distort
ed from its original objectt, and Con
gress has just passed a rural credit
measure committing the United States
to a system of state-aided, govern-

ment-managed-and-directed rural cre
dit banks. The passage of the Hollis
bill determines prematurely a ques
tion most vital to the nation, committ-
ana unaerstana. xne measure in its
present form is as unsound as the
free silver propaganda of twenty
years ago and as dangerous. Time
has convinced the country of the un
wisdom of the free silver project and
time will demonstrate the inherent
danger of this rural credit measure.
Without going into an extended dis
cussion of the Hollis bill, I may say
that there are many important as
well as minor objections to it. It es
tablishes a system of twelve govern
ment rural credit banks at the start,
with an unlimited number of addition
al ones, all under the direct control of
a federal bureau authorized to ab
stract money for private individual
from the public treasury at two per
cent or for no interest, and to involve
the credit of the United States in the
issue of unlimited millions of dollars
of bonds bearing interest at a rate as
high as five per cent, per annum and
running for indefinite periods, even to
several future generations.
This bureau and the banks and as
sociations which it is to establish, are
not to be obliged to use the money so
obtained in making farm loans, but
may use it all in Government enter
prises if they wish to do so. Moreover
the system thus devised could loan
only up to one-half the value of the
mortgaged farm. The borrower could
not use the money according to his own
judgment, but only for some designat
ed and sworn-to purpose under the di
rection of Federal officers, while he
would have to spend five per cent of
his loan in buying shares in the land
credit system.
. The farmers of this country need
organization much more ' than they
need Government intervention and as
sistance. If there were rural systems
of finance and business especially de
voted to the particular needs and re
quirements of agriculture, formed and
managed by the farmers themselves
and serving only their own interests,
the problems of financing the farmers
in long and short term operations
would be readily solved. ,
The systems should be co-operative
in every sense of the word. Co-operation
is based on individual initiative,
private interprise, self-reliance, mu
tual help, and trust and confidence in
one another, and it manifests itself in
the formation of associations and of a
jystem out of those associations. Al
ready Ohio farmers practice co-opera-tionin
many places in purchasing
re'-iBupplie. and in manufacturing certain
products. They should extend the
practice by forming associations
through which they may use their
money and credit for their common
and individual good and organize and
finance systems for utilizing their re
sources for agricultural purposes.
If Ohio farmers were so organized,
they could get capital on easier terms
than at present, especially in outlying
districts away from the large cities.
That result would come from the fact
that there is less risk in lending mon
ey or in according credit to a group
fifty or more farmers than to just
farmer. In this simple act lies
"i" " ; . ' r' ZlV
organized farmers of Gerrna ny,
Austria, Belgium, France, Holland
and Denmark.
So Ohio farmers should carefully
consider the object of organization,
specially in respect to their credit and
resources. When they have thorough
ly studied it, they will realize that any
plan of government aid and interven
tion is only a makeshift that could
bring but a temporary advantage at
most, and will decide that the plan of
mutual self-help and co-operative or
ganization is the true way to a gener
al and permanent improvement of
their financial condition. The bulding
and loan associations, so numerous in
Ohio, are striking examples of the suc
cess of co-operation and the organi
zation of credit and resources for
banking or credit purposes, either on
a small or large scale.
, Though I have opposed as unneces
sary and undesirable the plan of Gov
ernment a'id which the Hollis bill em
bodies, yet it seems inevitable that
this bill be accepted as the expression
of the national attitude on land credit,
But the Hollis bill contains no appli
cation of the co-operative principles,
nor does it solve the need of farmers
for short-time credit for the current
expenses of running the farm. Ac
cordingly I believe there is room in
Ohio lor the development among tne
farmers of co-operative organizations
through which this important need for
short-time funds can be met. Some
legislation is needed to open the way
for such organization. Governor Willis
has appointed Mr. L. J. Taber, Master
of the Ohio State Grange, Mr. O. N.
Sams, head of the Ohio Bankers As
sociation, and myself as members of a
committee to suggest the legislative
steps necessary to bring about these
results. With the aid of societies and

THE CALL"
There's a call to the fields and the
fountains;
There's a call to the rolling sea, '
Tis the balmy winds of Summer v
That waft the call to me,
And I leave the desk and table; j
The narrow and stifling room
To mingle awhile with the forests
With plant and with flower to com
mune. There's a call to the hills and the val
leys;
There's a call to meadow and lee
Oh who would inhabit the city
When the country's so green and so
free;
Oh who can rest for an hour ,
In the dusty city street,
When the pure fresh air of the coun
try. Is laden with fragrance sweet
There's a call to the fields, and the
meadows,
There's a call to the tossing sea
I see the oak tree arching above me,
Hear the wild bird happy and free,
While the river is ever splashing,
As it takes its downard way
To empty is garnered waters
At the margin of the bay.
There's a call to. the lakes and the
rapids;
A call that I can not resist,'
Tis the low soft call of nature,
So how can my nature persist. . -The
Tree's cooling shade invites, me;
I hear the hum ol tre bee; '' ' 'V
I've broken man's social fetters,
I am off to the desert and free.

HOW THE -GERRYMANDER"
WAS BORN
It was an early American newspa
per editor who made the word "gerry
mander." He was Major Be'njamin
Russell of the Massachusetts Centinel,
which he and his partner Warden
founded in 1784. He was a fighting
man, and the Centinel was no tame
journal, but whacked blithely and
.cared not where the chips fel.l says
the editor of The Mergenthaler Lines
O' Type News.
In 1811 the Massachusetts Legisla
ture under Governor Gerry made a
neat new division of districts for Con
gress elections . The most
insidious
and ingenious arrangement of districts
was the one for the County of Essex,
With great glee Russell took a map of
the county and colored the districts to
show the heinousness of the device.
Gilbert Stuart, the famous painter,
saw the map and suggested that the
apportionment looked like a reptile.
He made a few marks on it with his
pencil and said: "There! it's a sala
mander!"
Russell jumped up, laughing. "Sala
mander!" he shouted, looking at. the
hideous figure: Gerrymander!
An engraving of the "gerrymander"
was made and hawked through the
State. Thus was born what probably
is one of the most constantly used of
all manufactured newspaper words.

James Whitcomb Riley, Best Loved of
Modern American Poet, Dies at His
Home on The Song Famous Locker

James Whitcomb Rileyr who has
for years sung the songs of the com

our country in such a way that he has
found his way into the hearts and
lives of men and women in all parts of
this nation, died at his home on Lock

Saturday night July 22nd, the result of
a paralytic stroke. Complying with
the earnest requests xthat came to him
from many sources, Governor Ralston
of Indiana prevailed upon relatives of
the dead poet to permit the body to lie
in state in the rotunda of the capitol
building in Indianapolis, from 3 p. m.
until 9 p. m. on Monday July 24th.
Thousands of citizens from every
walk of life including boys and girls
for whom he has sung so well came
to look for the last time upon the face
of the poet they had loved so well.
The bronze casket containing the
body was borne from the home on
Lockerbie street by stalwart police
men and escorted to the state house by
Governor Ralston and Mayor Bell of
Indianapolis, was taken to the rotunda
of the capitol building where it rested

HOLSTON TQUft
The Fulton County Holstein-Friesian
Association Enjoy An Auto Tour
and Round-Up for Picnic Dinner and
Enthusiastic Meeting Better Stock
on Fulton's Farms.
On Tuesday of this week The Fulton
County Holstein-Friesian Association
enjoyed an auto tour in the eastern
half of the county visiting the homes
some of the pure bred Holstein
herds and "Rounding Up" for a picnic
dinner and -meeting at the home of
Mr. w. i Biddle at Ai.
The start was made from Wauseon
8:30 and the first stop was made at
the farm of H. A. McQuilIen near Del-
the home of Rovalton De Kol. Violet
who has made the vorld'a record for
ight months, producing 25000 pounds
f milk in that period. This cow is
now under official test and the visitors
found her being cared for as beeomes
such an aristocratic lady as ghe is,
four times a day at 6 o'clock morning
and evening and at 12 o'clock noon and
midnight this cow is milked and every
thing possible is done for her comfort,
even to the running of a power' fan,,
to insure her comfort. . Royaltoa De
Kol Violet is recognized as the best of
her family in Fulton county and in
deed, as a milk producer, the best in
the world, she comes from the herd of
W. rl. standish of Koyarton townshni
ana is ten years oi age. The next
stop was made at the farm of M. H.
Miller whose herd, was inspected, then
to the farm of M. B. Hoyt and on to
tne . A. L.uthy home, both of these
places are the homes of some verv dis
tinguished herds of , the-Holstein-Friesian
family and all of the party which
included lames as well as gentlemen
were interested not only in the fine herds
herds but as well the arrangement of
dairy barns and the methods followed
in caring- for" the herds and -their pro
ducts Arriving at the beautiful home
of Mr. and Mrs. W. L. Biddle at Ai
the party found the spacious lawn pre
pared for their coming; a long table on
the lawn was ready to receive the con
tents of the baskets that had been
brought along by the party and re
freshing lemonade and delicious pop
corn were served by the host along
with his hearty welcome to all. While
the party enjoyed the picnic -dinner
made still more palatable by the
sauce of appetite, an orchestra of
Wauseon young people composed of
Gertrude Barber, Marjorie Whiteman,
Donald. ' Grisier, Charles Cole, and
Helen Ruppert rendered some fine
music - I
After the dinner the gathering was
called to order by W. H. Standish.
Music by orchestra was the first num
ber on an informal program that was
none the less interesting because of its
informal character: ,
A Bill to be introduced into the
State Legislature regarding the regis
tration of pure bred stock was brought
to the attention of the company and
after discussion a resolution "was pass
ed objecting to the passoge of such a
bilL Prof. O. E. Erf of the Ohio State
University gave a very interesting ad
dress "which -he complimented the
Holstein-Friesian Association of Ful
ton county and stated that this pres
ent tour was tne best ne had -ever attended-Professor
Erf pled for stock
improvement on the farms and 'for 'a
closer co-operation among the farm
ers and dairymen, which he said was
of greater importance - and more
needed than governmental- assistance
and intervention.' .' .
Prof. Erf s address was followed 1f
a recitation by JVliss Marjorie White
man which was-1 so heartily 'encored
that Miss. Whiteman firraeiously re
sponded witrr another recitation that
was as much eirwyea as itne-nrst. ' A
vote of thanks to Mr. Biddle and fami
ly for their hospitality -was follow
ed by the adioarnment of one of the
most successful and valuable gather
ings of this character ever held in the
county. Huchvevents as tnis'-wmcn

of matters that arc of : common inter

of the community and promoting Ihe
co-operation and good fellowship that
are essential to the generarnreeperity
and well being of the community. -
About twenty automobiles were -on
the tour and more - than one tinndred

"CUT PRICES" ..
The Stephen-Ashorst Bill introduc
ed in Congress by Senator Henry F.
Ashurst of Arizona and Representa
tive Dan V. Stephen of Nebraska is
designed to provide a remedy for tha
unfair competition of great trading
monoplies. - This unfair competition
consists chiefly in advertising at "cut
prices" well-known goods as a means
of inducing the public to buy unknown
goods of doubtful quality.
Cut prices concerns article as a bait
to catch the consumers, and decieve
them into believing that all their
goods offered for sale are at the same
low rate of prolt.
Trade investigations agree that the
cost of doing business by these big
city concerns is approximately 30 per
cent, while the cost of the average
small -merchant is 16 per cent.
These "price cutters" cannot un
dersell the independent' merchants;
the only seem to. They sell things
that people know at cost On-jmfami-liar
goods they overcharge. The con- ,
sumer is deceived by the false repre
sentation that their mass of unknown
goods is sold at the same price re
duction on a few well-known article.
, The effect of this unfair advertising
parctice is to destroy the independent
merchants of the towns and small
cities, and build up great chain-store
and mail-order systems, and compel
the sale of inferior goods by all classes
of dealers. Price cutting is not in the
interests pf the public.
It means the destruction of the - us
ual retail channels by which goods
reach the consumers, to their best ad
vantage. It forces the sale of un
known articles, often of cheap and ,
shoddy quality, instead of reliable
goods which have their maker's repu
tation behind them. ' It promotes sub
stitution. .
The ultimate result of the exten
sion and continuance of this practice
will mean nothing less than the ruin
ot Hundreds of thousands of independ
ent merchants; the concentratoiu of
trade in vast monopolies located in a
few great cities; a decline in prosper
ity and population of the villages,
towns and small cities and the ultimate
injury of the consumers, by placing
them at the mercy of monopolies which'
will then be able to extort, such pro- ;
fits as they please forhe sale bf such
goods as they choose to handle. '
GIRLS' DAY.
Last Sunday was Girls' Day at the
M. E. Sunday School. Everything was
turned over to the girls for this day.
They were granted full charge, abso-'
lute right of way, to do with the
school just what they would for the
one day.' Their- first move was to
elect their officers, lay their plans,
and name their1 committees.' The
boys stood back and watched for- de
velopments. Nothing appeared on the
surface but secret whisperings and an
increased rustling of skirts, until Sat-
urday afternoon when suddenlv an au
to-load of joy-faced young maiden3
witn -music and yells and banners
streaming paraded the town adver
tising- their day. Sunday morning
found the Sunday School rooms gayly
decorated 'with" vines and flowers most
of which the girls had gathered from
the bush and country side Saturday
atternoon. sweet peas were pinned on
blushing, boys and .bashful men, upon
arrival, by a committee of young
ladies whose services seemed sweeter
by far than the sweetness they were
handling. Special ; music, scripture
recitation, Bible exercises; etc., where
thrown round the regular lesson in
such fashion as to make the hour a
very delight to the soul. Everyone
pronounced this day- a charming success.-'
'- ,
Next Sunday is Boys' Day. Their
plans 'are1 as" yet wholly a secret but
that something will be doing is assur-.
ed. , They are counting on outdoing
the girls but whether their fond am
bition shall be realized remains to be
A PLEASANT EVENT.
