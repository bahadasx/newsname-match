Tourists Pass
Through Beach
Tourists to YeliWstone Park
Make Hour's Stop in Beach
Twenty-Five Cars in
All.
About twenty-five cars o." tour
ists. making the trip over the Red
Trail to the Yellowstone Park
spent about an hour in Beach,
"the biggest little city along the
entire route," as they put it, last
Tuesday.
To mlany of them who had
never passed through North Da
kota except on a train, the trip
proved a revelation, and when
they were informed that ten years
ago the prosperous and well-built
up Golden Valley was considered
a "cow country" unfit for agri
cultural purposes, they, were
more than astonished. Some of
1he celebrities present were loud
in their praises of the city of
Beach, commenting favorably on
it as a modern city in every res
pect.
After leaving here their first
slop was at Glendive where they
had lunch. A special train carry
ing Pullmans, dining cars, and
others accompaniedithe tourists to
the Park, as a good many expect
ed to ship their cars back and
return on the train.
The tour was promoted by the
N. P. Railway Company and the
Chalmers Motor Car Co., the lat
ter concern having a representa
tion of four cars in the twenty
five. owned and driven by men
of knowledge concerning motor
cars. Gov. L. B. Hanna drove a
Chalmers Six and was second in
the order of travel, the first be
ing the pilot car, a Chalmers that
passed through Beach on the
«ame tour last spring.
Dr. and Mrs. C. E. Fuller re
turned Wednesday evening from
a month's automobile trip .thru
North and South Dakota, visiting
friends and relatives enroute.
Some of the cities they visited
were, Jamestown, Hettinger and
"Bowman, North Dakota and
Mowbridge, Lemon and DesMit,
South Dakota. They made their
longest stay at the latter city
•where they visited relatives. The
Dr. says that on the return trip
he paid especial attention to the
condition of the crops along the
way up from DesMit and that the
crops in the Golden Valley ex
ceed those of any other section
he passed through. Drouth in
-certain sections has raised havoc
with the yield while in other sec
tions black rust has got in its
deadly wjork. He says that it is
a fact, and is conceded by many
farmers in South Dakota that the
yield in many places will not
-average over five bushels of
•wheat the acre. Judging by
what land men told him during
his stay in our sister state to the
south, there will be an influx of
land-seekers in this section of
North Dakota this fall, and more
especially in the far famed Gold
en Valley.
Wm. Rosenberg and wife left
Sunday for Chicago where they
will buy the fall and winter stock
for The Toggery here and the
store at Ollie.
George Chrysler drove to Plev
na, Montana on business last
Wednesday.
The fact that the editor of the
Chronicle yestreday received two
letters from- other states asking
as to the feasibility of establish
ing business places in Beach, goes
to prove that the Golden Valley
is known for its productiveness
throughout the entire west. On-j
of the communications was fro*n
a gentleman at Fair Play, Mo.,
injuring as to whether or not
there was an opening for another
grocery store here.
New Auto Route
Being Made
Scout Car to Visit Beach—Cham

Beach, N. D.
Gentlemen:
July 25, 1916.
Knowing that you are vitally in
terested in the future of motorist
travel into the Northwest, I feel
sure you will be interested in the
trip of one of our Blue Book's
scout cars through your city.
The Blue Book scout car investi
gating the National Parks High
way and connecting routes is now
oil its way into the Northwest in
charge of Mr. R. A. Woodall and
Mr. F. S. Whiting, Earlier in the
year we expected to send a rep
resentative with the officialcars of
the Highway which covered the
route last month, but in view 'of
the increase of importance of mo
tor travel into the Northwest, we
finally decided to send one of our
own cars into this territory be
cause we plan to do as much new
work and because with our own
car are a little freer as to time,
which is ail important in gather
ing data for our future editions.
Both Messrs. Woodall and
Whiting (are thoroughly exper
ienced in our work and the form
er particularly has devoted prac
tically all of his time in our em
ploy for the last five years in
vestigating road conditions be
tween the Mississippi and Pacific
Coast, so that we know he is
thoroughly equipped to judge the
relative merits of routes.
When you consider that this
season we are selling of our 1916
edition one hundred and ten
thousand volumes, and on present
estimate we will be completely
sold 'out by September 1st, you
will readily appreciate the grow
ing importance of the Automobile
Blue Book as the Motorist's Bi
ble." The demand for route in
formation has become so great
on our Touring Bureau that the
force in both our New York and
Chicago offices is three times
what it was a year ago, simply
to assist motorists in planning
routes and handling up-to-the
minute information sent in the
various sections of the country.
The cars left Minneapolis
about ten days ago. We want to
be in the best possible shape to
give the motorist accurate infor
mation not only on route direc
tions, but accomodations, scenery
points of interest, etc., through
out the Northwest and any co
operation which you can give
these men will be highly appre
ciated and I feel positive will re
vert to our mutual advantage.
Yours very truly,
Automobile Blue Book Publish

The Powers Will
Stay in Business
Re-Organization Took Place
Hundreds of Patrons More
Than Pleased at Deci
sion of that Pop
ular Store.
A great many Golden Valley
jeople will be more than pleased
to hear that The Powers, at the
request of hundreds of their
friends will remain in the cloth
ing business in Beach, although
in the re-organization, which took
place before they decided to re
main, two new members were
taken into the firm.
J. J. Power, one of the new
members, has been in the employ
of the firm for the past two years,
dividing his time almost equally
between the Beach and Killdeer
stores. He is a young man with
blight prospects and needs no in
troduction to our readers, as he
enjoys the acquaintance of many
of the customers of this popular
trading place. F. B. Power, re
cently of Modesto, California,
where he was employed by a large
clothing and shoe firm, is a val
uable addition to the firm, as he
hi ings with him years of exper
ience in the clothing business
with some very large concerns.
We understand that last firm in
whose employ he was, upon hear
ing of his intention to resign
made him an offer that was most
attractive his refusal to accept it
being based upon the information
his brother, T. J. had given him as
to the future of the Golden Val
ley. •,
The Powers have always car
red one of the largest and most
complete stocks of men's and
boy's clothing, shoes for the
whole family, and furnishings, in
western North Dakota, and as
they are now in the possession of
more capital' by taking in two
members, they will carry a larger
and more complete stock than
ever.
T. J. Power, the present man
ager, and one of the most popular
business men in Beach, will re
main in that capacity. He will
leave next Sunday for the East
ern markets, where he will pur
chase the largest and most com
plete tjock of up-to-the-minute
Mottling and furnishings for the
fall and winter trade ever shown
in this section Jof the state.

Famous Hoosier
Poet Dead
James Whitcomb Riley, Half
Uncle of Postmaster John
M. Baer, and Noted ..
Poet Dies Suddenly
Indianapolis, Ind., July 24
James Whitcomb Riley, world
famous Hoosier poet died Satur
day evening. Death was due to a
stroke of paralysis. He was suf
fering from the heat Saturday but
showed signs of improvement in
the evening. At 11 o'clock he ask-
I his nurse for a drink. When she
returned with the water he was
dead.
James Whitcomb Riley, horn
of the middle west, sang the joys,
sorrows, fancies and humors of
its folks, largely in its own dialect.
1 he world was so touched by its
inspiration and the realism of his
homely symbols that he was one
of the few, that, devoting their
lives to poetry, gained a fortune.
Mr. Riley was peculiarly sensi
tive to the advance of age and ad
ded inquires as u» the da of
his hii'ih but the most accurate in
formation available indicates that
he was born in 1848.
"Should you ask his age," one
of his friends said, "he would an
swer 'This side of forty' and leave
you to guess which side."
The poet was the son of Reub
en A. Riley, a lawyer and political
speaker of Greenfield, Ind. The
hoy could not be brought to the
dull routine of school days, but
he was wise in the lore of streams
and fields. His mother, who was
Elizabeth Marine before her mar
riage, was a writer of verse and
Riley in later life attributed some
of his impracticability to her.
Instead of preparing for the
practice of law, as his fatherwish
ed the son turned itinerant sign
painter. For ten years, he roved
through the Ohio valley painting
signs on fences. He had the trick
of the brush and pencil and clev
erly drew sketches illustrating
the virtues of merchandise He
was naturally musical and shone
as a fiddler in the villages at
which his party stopped at night.
He played for dances and at con
certs in country hotels. He wrote
rhymes which sometimes found
their way into country newspa
pers.
He lead this cheerful, free
and easy life late in the '70 then
he took employment as a report­
er on a nawspaper at Anderson,
Ind.. In 1877, for the purpose as
he said, of proving that he could
write poetry of value, he perpe
trated the Poe hoax which for
years was a literary sensation.
He worte a poem in the style of
l\dgar Allen Poe, to which he
gave the Characteristic title of
"I.eonanie," and it was offered
to the public as a hitherto unpub
lished product of the genius of
Toe. One of the stanzas was:
"I.eonanie—the angels naniedher,
And they took the light
Of the laughing stars and framed
her
In a smile of white.
And they made her hair of
gloomy
Midnight and her eyes of
bloomy
Moonshine and they brought
her to me
In the solemn night.
In some quarters the poem was
accepted as genuine in others it
was denounced as a fraud. After
the controversy had waged for
months Riley confessed.
In the early '80s he began
writing verses in "Hoosier" dia
lect for the old Indianapolis Jour
nal. He sent some of lis poems to
Henry Wadsworth Longfellow
and they received his
praise. A volume was published
and The Hoosier Poet" began his
win a public. He was an excellent
reader of his own dialect verses
and for the following fifteen
years, or until 1898 he made tours
of the country, appearing in pub
lic with great successs both al
one and in association with the
humorist, Bill Uye, who was his
intimate friend.
Publication of books of poems
year after after year brought Ril
ey. a fortune and wide recogni
tion of his literary genius and
not only in the general forin.Many
of his poems are of imaginative
fantasy of gently philosophic.
In 1902 he received the degree
of master of arts from Yale uni
versity and in 1904 the Univer
sity of Pennsylvania coferred up
on him the degree of doctor of
letters. Indiana University con
ferred the honorary degree of
l.L. D. on him in 1907.
In July 1911, the poet presented
to the city of Indianapolis prop
erty valued at $75,000 for a site
for the public library and school
admnistration bulding.
Mr. Rley never married but he
was a lover of children, whose
spirit he divined so intimately,
an of family life. Many of the
last years of his life he spent
quietly at his home in a secluded
section of Indianapolis.
A baseball game that will pro
bably draw the largest crowd
seen in Beach at a similar ocas
sion this year is the one sched
uled for Thursday, Aug 1, be
tween the All Nations and the Vo
cal city team. The All Nations
have played in Beach before and
put up the classiest exhibition of
the national pastime of any team
that vere visited here. In their
line-up they have representatives
from a dozen different countries,
including John Donaldson, the
most wonderful ball player the
world has ever seen, color alone
barring him from leading the
pitching staff in major league.
The home guards are sprucing
up a bit for the occassion and
the game will not be a walk-a
vay for anyone, unless we are
badly mistaken.

GUARDS ENJOY SERVICE
ON PULLMANS TO MEXICO
Luxury to Crawl in Between
Sheets Once More
Kansas City, Mo.,—(On Board
Special Troop Train Carrying
Third Battalion First Regiment
North Dakota Infancy.)—July
25.—The soldier hoys from North
Dakota, in striikng contrast to
their less fortunate comrades
from points in the east, are en
joying "some service" and good
substantial food en route to the
southland.
After spending a month in camp
sleeping on the hard ground and
going thru a grilling routine of
drill each day, it was a real treat
for the North Dak'otans to climb
aboard real Pullmans and sleep
between nice clean white sheets.
Shipping ice cold lemonade
twice a day at meal times on the
train has had a tendency to make
the hoys feel like kings. Accord
ing to the quartermaster's depart
ment, there are lemons enough
on hand to furnish the b'oys with
the delicious cold drink twice a
day for the balance of the trip.
And for all this comfort and
even luxury the North Dakotans
can thank their kindly command
er, ol. J. H. Fraine, who saw to It
that "his Hoys would not suf
fer."
However, the officers of the
Third battalion, each, of
whom has to provide his own
meals, were "out of luck" last
evening. Private and non-com,
had mess as usual, but the offi
cers telephoned ahead to Ha
warden, la., to have the "feeds'"
ready for them. Arriving at Ha
arden, where a short stop wasr
made, they found that everything
in the eating line had been sold
and many of the officers were
obliged to go to bed with empty
stomachs.
The troops enjoyed an hour in
Kansas City today.
