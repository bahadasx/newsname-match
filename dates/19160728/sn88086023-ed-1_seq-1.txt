RAKISH, ore., July 28. At a con
ference between members of a com
mittee chosen at a meeting of bust-
"ess men, who subscribed to the fund
to purchase ornamental lighting poles
for the business section, and the city
commissioners, the single unit sys
tem pole was selected as being the
most up-to-date type of ornamental
pole, which is supplanting other types
in some of the larger cities. This de
cision was reached despite the fact
that the original plans contemplated
the cluster system.
The poles aril be ordered at once,
Pay for the poles and the city bears
the installation cost and will furnish
the power from the municipal plant
The poles of the Eastern Oregon

now marring the business section, will
probably be removed soon.
