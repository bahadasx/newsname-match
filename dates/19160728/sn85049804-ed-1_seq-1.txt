EDITOR'S OBSERVATIONS.
Fairfield was our next stop. Helre
we found that several colored famil
ies had left this city. We do not
knew the cause. Perhaps to seek
better wages. Mr. Quinn is still work
ing at the malleable iron shops, as is
G. W. Coal son. They both own beau
tiful homes, well kept. F. A. An
thony is training horses for the com
ing fairs. Sam Sykes is one of the
oldest residents and he retired from
the barber business, which he follow
ed until recently. He owns valuable
property. Ben E. Detwilder is doing
well. Mrs. Wm. Smith has built his
new modern honte and he is still
working at the iron company. |W. C.
Bennings is still here, working at the
same place.
We next drove over to M.t. Pleas
ant, where lives about 600 colored
people. There are two churches, the
Baptist, pastored by Rev. J. M.
Eaves, who is doing good work here
with his church. They own a nice
church. Rev. Jackson lives here, but
pastors the Baptist church at New
Boston and Montrose. He owns a
home and is a hustler. The A. jtf. E.
church is pestered by Rev. B. Ff
Hubbard, who is dotag good wort:
with the number of people he has to
work with. Harry Burnaugh is still
in the contracting business, associat
ed with Mr. E. H. Reecer. They are
hustling young men and a credit to
our race. Mr. Reecer owns a beauti
ful home in the suburbs of the city.
He has fine friut trees on it. Clay
Reed is still farming this year. H.
F. Foster is also fanning so is Mr.
John Greenup, and their crops are as
good as could be expected, consider
ing the dry weather. John W. Har
ris is another man who lives in town
and is farming. He has recently
bought him a farm and is improving
it near the city. Thus little by little
our people are buying Iowa farms.
We are glad to note this and hope
that more will do likewise. J. W.
Fiddler, who' worked a few months
with Lu Shelton's barber shop in
Des Moines last year, and married
one of our girls, Miss Griffin, has
opened a tonsorial shop at No. 417
N. Adams street and is doing well.
J. W. HHedge, an old soldier, is still
in the barbering business at 519 N.
Jay street. He is a fine man to meet.
Mrs. H. Walters owns a valuable
home on a prominent street. Miss
Minnie Page will be the Bystander
at the high school. Mt. Pleasant can
boast of more colored people gradu
ating from their high school and the
Wesleyan college than &ny other
town in Iowa in like proportion to
the colored population, and many of
her graduates have gone out in the
world and have made a great success.
Many have married and have made
excellent husbands and good wives.
Their general educational qualifica
tions here are far above the average
in other Iowa communities and their
vefihement is very noticeable. Mrs.
Ralph Burnaugh is a sample of this
type culture. Mrs. Harriet Smith
and Mrs. Martha Baugh are living at
the same place. The former is treas
urer of the Iowa-Nebraska Baptist
association and has been for many
years. Mr. S. McCracken and son
Are still operating his barber shop.
One of his daughters of St. Paul,
Minn., is visiting him now. He owns
9 beautiful home.

A GREAT MAN AND
GONE.
Ottumwa, Iowa.—We regret to say
that our short acquaintance with
Henry T. Elliott makes it impossible
for me to do ustice to this cause but
to my mind one of the brightest
minds in the Masonic jurisdiction of
Iowa was snatched out when Mr. El
liott passed away on July 2d.
His knowledge of Masonry placed
him in the front rank as a Masonic
historian, and he knew the ritual
equally as well as he knew the his
tory. It was he in the lodge room
who was ever ready to correct, to the
satisfaction of all, any doubt in the
minds of the brethren regarding the
work. I was always willing td trust
Elliott's word on any question rela
tive to Masonry without consulting
the ritual, or history. It is the writ
er's prayer that the mantle of Henry
T. Elliott may fall on some member
of Golden Star lodge, No. 4, A. F. &
A. M., Ottumwa, Iowa.
He was elected W. M. of Golden
Star lodge, No. 4, in 1904, and grand
chaplain of the grand lodge of Iowa
the same year. He also had the im
perial grand counsel Arabic order of
nobles of Mystic Shrine. This thirty
second degree was conferred upon
him March 20, 1899.
The subject of this sketch was born
in Nashville, Tenn., June 2, 1850. He
was united in marriage to Miss Ada
England in Springfield, 111., October
18, 1877. To this union six children
were born, all of which survive ex
cept Charles O., who passed aWay
April 3, 1912. Aside from hUfc Ma
sonic career he was a devout chris
tian. He held the office of deacon in
the Second Baptist church for twen
ty-five years, -which office he held un
til his death. The end came as men
tioned above, at his residence, 318
Kenyon avenue. The surviving mem
bers of his family are a loving wife,
Mrs. Ada Elliott three daughters,
two sons and one grandson, as fol
lows: Mrs. Lily Bailey of Omaha,
Nebraska, David C. of Omaha, Neb.,
Mrs Leslie Phelps of Minneapolis,
Minn., Mrs. Maud Howels of Van
couver, British Columbia, Frank El
liott of Ottumwa, Iowa, and Russell
Bailey, grandson.
So in closing the following lines
might well be applied to him: "When
the ancient historian shall write the
names of good and great nien upon
the scholl of honor, may the name of
honor, may the name of Henry T. El
liott be. inscribed in unfading letters
as unfading as the evergreen, as ex
haustless as the sunlight, may he
shine without abatement throughout
all eternity. _•

NEJGROES LURED FROM SOUTH
BY HIGHER WAGES,
Take Foreign Labor's Joba.
This is the third of a series of arti
cles by Mr. Hyde in the Chicago
Daily Tribune in answer to the ques
tion, "After the War—What?"
By Henry M. Hyde,
Along row of little one story wood
en shacks winds round the side of a
mountain in West Virginia. Just be
low the center of the row is the open
ing of a great coal mine, which leads
on a horizontal plane into the bowels
of the peak.
Before the war in Europe every
shack was occupied by Italian and
Serbian miners. Most of them lived
in boarding houses, but some had
brought over their families and lived
with wife and children in one of the
smaller shacks-.
Today most of the shacks are" va
cant. Practically all of the miners
have gone back to Europe to fight.
The last report Of the national bu
reau of immigrant shows that the
number of Italians in the United
States now is 100,000 less than it was
two years ago.
Money Lures Negro.
Their places in the coal mines have
been taken chiefly by Negroes from,
the farms of Virginia and other
southern states. When a black farm
hand earning $1 or $1.25 a day at
home is offered from $3 to $4 a day
to work in a coal mine the call is al
most irresistible.
To this single coal mine in West
Virginia more than 400 Negroes have
gone in the last eighteen months.
They are beginning to take their
families with them and to settle in
the old wooden shacks deserted by the
Italians.
Much the same change has come to
other mines, construction camps, and
even factories, all over the north. By
tens of thousands the Negroes have
left the farms of the south and have
gone north to take the place of Eu
ropean laborers called home or kept
home by the great war. They go
north because northern industries can
offer to pay bigger wages than the
farmers of the south. And the move
ment has just begun. So long as the
war lasts, at least, it will continue
to increase in volume.
Already the African migration is
well under way. It means a lot to
both the north and the south and to
all classes of people in both sections.
9,000,000 in Soutti.
When the war in Europe began
there were a few more than a million
Negroes living north of Mason and
Dixon's line. In the southern states
there were about 9,000,000 Negroes.
In the north the Negro has been
permitted ordinary political and civil
liberties. He has been allowed to
cast his vote and to take a modest
part in the government. But his in
dustrial opportunities have been few.
The competition and opposition of
immigrant and native white labor
have shut him out of the better paid
£ttd more desirable lines of work. Al
most all the labor unions have barred
him from membership. He has been
driven to take menial, poorly paid,
and disagreeable employment. There
are 7,000 or more Negro saloon por
ters in Chicago, thousands of boot
blacks, and other thousands working
as porters on Pullman cars.
During the recent period & busi
ness depression the lines against the
Negro were drawn more tightly
northern cities. He was shut out of
many positions which were formerly
open to him. There has been, also,
an increase in race prejudice. Some
northern cities have passed segrega
tion laws compelling all Negroes to
live in certain less desirable districts
of the city.1

ft .«* .•••**( 1* H^fcjLy4 f,
Now, with the new call from th«
north, southern farmers are finding
it almost impossible to get farm
hands. If the hegira of Negroes con
tinues for another year—as it seems
certain to—their condition is likely to
become desperate. Farm wages will
certainly go up all over the south.
Negroes in North to Double.
The best available authorities esti
mate that by the end of 1917 the
number of Negroes in the north is
likely to be doubled. The Arst effect
of the African migration to the north
probably will be an increase in race
prejudice and race disturbances in
northern cities. Hitherto considerable
bodies of Negroes have often come
into northern industrial Communities
as strike breakers. The feeling
against them among working people
has been strong.
The fact that at present there is
work for practically, every white
workman and that wages, on the
whole, are higher than ever before
will tend to smother for the time any
outbreak of race prejudice. With a
good job of his own, the white n^an
will not strenuously object to the Ne
gro taking a less important and prof
itable place. So long as prosperity
continues there will probably be no
trouble.
But the unorganized Negro from
the south, used to working at small
is, may be willing to take less
lan the white man demands for the
Same work. If that happens to any
considerable extent there is certain
to be an outbreak of bitter feeling.
Effect Will Probably Be Good.
In the long run, if'the Negro hegira
continues, as it seems sure to do, the
effect will probably be good It will
be good for .the south to have the col
ored population more evenly distrib
uted ever the country. It will com
pel the southern states to encourage
the coming of white immigrants. In
a few states that process has already
Legun. Jr. three counties of Virginia,
for instance—Prince George, Ches
terfield, and one other—the vacant
lands have been entirely iepopulated
by Bohemian farmers, who are set
ting an example of thrift and good
husbandry which is inspiring. It will
be good for the north to share more
fully in the solution of the problem
for which the whole country is re
sponsible. It will be good for the
black man because it will improve his
economic position. And it will do the
white workman of the north no harm
because the presence in any part of
the country of a great unorganized
end poorly paid body of labor-always
tends to depress wages generally.
Meanwhile, during the next few
years northern communities will have
to adapt themselves to the presence
of greatly increased Negro colonies
the south will be forced to use more
machinery on its farms and to plant
crops which need les3 hand labor.
The migration of the Negroes to
the north is only one of the big new
problems which the war in Europe
has forced upon the people of the
United States.

self. Skilled Negro tradesmen work
on equal terms and at equal wages
with their comparatively rare white
competitors. Even on southern farms
and plantations, where wages have
been very low, living expenses also
have been low. The industrious Ne
gro has been able to earn a living and
in thousands of cases to get a few
acres of ground and a cabin of his
own. But even before the war in
Europe there was a noticeable move-*
ment of southern Negroes from the
rural districts to the cities.
