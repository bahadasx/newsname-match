nu t with a tragic death In this city
lunt Tuesday afternoon about three
o clock.
Ciisperson was employed by E. It,
Jackson, of Van Weil, in moving the
old Urothjun Garage building to the
Win. Siler f.iVin. three miles eust of
town. Mr. CnspersQii climbed on top
of the building to see that no wires
were torn down In the progress out
of town. At the corner of Main and
Fulton HtreetH he took hold of two
electric wires to raise them over his
head. The wires he took bold of
were high tension wires and carried
a charge of 2200 volts. The Insula
tion was probably not heavy enough
to hold the current and Casperson re
ceived a portion of the charge
through the body. The shock caused
him to fall from the building and the
weight of his body broke the wires
and the unfortunate man fell to the
htree? on his head. Physicians were
hurriedly summoned and worked
with the Injured man In an iflort to
save bis life, but to no avail. He
died twenty minutes after Sie fall
Both hands of the v ictl mwere hor
ribly burned and his face was badly
bruised and a deep gash cut in bis
head by the fall.

and leaves a wife and baby three
months old.

CRIDERSVILLE
Sleuths Run Down Wife Deserter
Was Piano Tuner Recently
Left Celina
Saturday afternoon the little vill
age of Cridersville was awakened to
a realization of the full majesty of
the law. Silab Silvers, a piano tuner
of Piqua, had deserted his family, a
wife and three children, aged three,
four and six years. The Humane So
ciety of Piqua took the matter up and
a search was made for the recalci
trant husband who had disobeyed the
marriage vows and deserted his bet
ter half. Several days previous to
his capture Silvers hud called on the
postmaster at Cridersville and asked
that his mail be kept at that particu
lar office for hiin until he called for
it. This led to his capture.
The Humane Society notified tho
police of all the nearby cities and vil
lages to be on the lookout for Silvers,
adn when he called for his mail at
Cridersville Saturday, the postmaster
notified the village marshal. The
marshal was shaving and in hla eag
erness to pursue the fugitive from
Justice, he dropped hib razor and hot
footed it toward the call to duty.

INFANTILE PARALYSIS
Tho following set of rulea to reg
ulate and control infantile- paralysis,
scientifically known as acute polio
myelitis, have been 'orwarded to the
local board of health lor publication
for the information of the public:
1. Isolation of the patient and
screening to keep out insects. Do
mestic animals should bt excluded
from the room.
2. Disinfection or dtstruellon of
all discharges, especially the sputum
and nasal secretions and excretions
from the intestines, urse and phys-
icans should observe the same pre
cautious regarding their hands and
clothing as in attending a case of
scarlet fever.
3. A modified quarantine shoulu
be observed, consisting of the isola
tion of tha patient and detention of
11 persons in the home, with the ex
ception of the breaawlnner. Quar
antine should presist for not less
than thirty days following the disap
pearance of acute symptoms. Ex
posed children must be quarantined
for a period of twenty one days from
date of last exposure to the disease.
4. When this disease is present in
community, public gatherings
which children will attend should be
discouraged.
5. Members of the family and oth
er exposures should use mouth wash
es and nasal douches under the di
rection of the attending physician.
6. As soon as praciicable after the
recovery of the patient, the house
should be disinfected with formalde
hyde.
The attention or (he physicians
should be directed to the fact that
bortive cases are often associated
with typical cases and the same pre
caution should be observed with such
cases.
8. Acute Poliomyelitis has been
declared by the state board of health
to be a reportable disease. This
means that all cases must be reported
by physicians to the health officer
and by the health officer to the sec
retary of the state board of health.
9. Since the disease Is infectious
prior to the onset of paralysis, sus
pected cases should be reported and
uarantined until tho exact nature of
the disease is known.

The enterprising merchants of the
villages of Mercer county have been
making more inquiries for exhibits

Agricultural machinery, says he
never, in all the time he has been
superintendent of machinery, had so-
any inquiries for spaces for exhib
iting of machinery, 1 nplements, fen
ces, automobiles carriages, ect. He
says he expects to have tha best show
Mercer county ever had.
The Fair Management has put a
lot of new roofs on their buildings
this year, raised and remodeled the
grandstand, put in a two-tnch tubing
fence all the way around the infield
of the race track, graded all the
drives leading into tho grounds and
then covered them with, stone screen
ings, so you need not fear of driv
ing in the mud whe nyou come to the
Mercer county Banner Fair, 1916.
Ask some of the members of the
Fair Board for Rules and Regula-
ons for the Horse Shoe Pitching
contest and put in your spare time

GOEISE
Of Wapakoneta Puts One Ove
Us, All Right

tiToiiiim ndi il lor Post must) r of
Celinn Alllnu Hilly Linen
A Washington dispatch of the 22nd
says Senator Pomereiie that day sent
to Postmaster Getieri.l lliirleson his
r j io m m nidation o f Lnwrenci
Schunck for Post master of Celiiiu.
TIim appointment of Mr. Schunck
was discounted by the knowing ones,
but has nevertheless caused consider
able adverse comment. When he re
turned, from Wapakoneta a few
months ugo where ho had been en
gaged In business fo rsome time, it
was gently Intimated he would be Cl-
lina's next postmaster, no difference
how nany candidates Celina might
have or how popular or well-lltted
and deserving they might be. How
ever several gentlemen entered tin
race and sent their petitions to Sena
tor Pomerene, among them were H.
W. Miller, George IV, lie, II. An
thony, Dillon R. Smalley, J. W. lie
dell and Mark Reckmun. Hut they
run up against a stone wall, and that
was J. lienry Goeke. of Wapakoneta
of whom Mr. SchtmrK was a faithful
lieutenant in that dirty congression
al fight two years a'o between Mr,
Cunningham and Mr. Goeke, result
ing In the defi at of tl.i i'onncr for the
nomination an dt lie Litter at the fall
electioi. i'liis i indoubteilly Mr.
Scuunck's reward fur his work in
that canpalgn.
That Mr. Goeke was able to dictate
the postmastership for Celina is rath
er grinding it may be believed, since
Mr. Schunck was the only one among
II the candidates mentioned that had
his nam" in any ways connected with
the dirty religious campaign between
Mr. Cunningham and Mr. Goeke, that
should put them both In the political
grave-yard beyond lvimrn'ot ion.
Since we are to have Mr. Schunck
for postmaster, for that seems to be
he handwriting on 'lie wall, it is
hoped he can rise above the mire,
hat caused his elevation.

TAX PAYERS, ATTENTION
The Mercer County Board of Re
vision makes the fi Mowing state
ments with regard t-J the returns of
personal property made to the assess
ors also the additions made by the as
sessors upon the call of the Board of
Wevision. The 191 C returns as made
by the assessors of the townships
showed a loss as compared to 1915 oi
1276.620. The Villages totalled a
loss or $66,420. The Board being
dissatisfied with the condition called
the assessors to ass;st in revising
household property snd farm mach
inery. The additions thus made
ainuotinted to $186,710. The Union
township returns were increased by
the addition of 20 per cent and
Iil.ickereek township by 10 per cent
on all personal property. Said In
creases were mostly on household
goods and farm machinery and rang
ed from $50 to 250.
Because of the increased demands
for improve ments In every ' taxing
district and necessarily greater ex
pense, the Board deemed it proper
that the duplicate value of Mercer
county should be raised, not lowered.
All officials of County, Township,
Village and Schoo. are asking for
more finances and by reason of the
state limitations more money can be
secured only by increased valuations.
We realize that much tangible credits
escape taxation. This should not be.
The taxing officials are handicapped
in probing false returns. Such per
sons, If detected, will be severely
dealt with.
We wish to call the attent!on of
the officials not to bjrden their con
stituents with excessive bond issues.
There is a limit to tax rates and also
to valuation for taxation. Do busi
ness for the public as for yourselves.
Get on a cash basis.
The Board of Complaints meets on
August 7, 1916 to consider all writ
ten complaints filed. The books are
now open for insption. The offi
cers and the clerks in the auditor's
oflice will gladly show you the re
turns. Very few changes have been
made on real estate.

have been bared from federal service
out of Company K.

They reside in St.. Marys, Celina,
Wapakoneta and New Bremen.
The drastic federal test applied,
Weduesday reduced the company ros
ter abort one third.
Condition of the eyesight , heart
and fiat feet are the most frequent
causes of failure to meet the federal
requirment.
The men rejected by the federal
examiners continae as members of
Company K, Ohio National Guard,
most of them bavin? previously tak
en tha examination for admission to
the State Guard.
The examination brought some
surprises; several men for whom
fears were entertained having got
ten by alright while others thought
to be physically able were turned
down.
There is a prevalent belief that
more troops are on hand than are
needed and that the test is purposely
made unusually severe to reduce the
number.
Second Lieut. Emil F. Marx Is in
command of Company K, Captain
RaudabauEh and First Lieutenant
Lewis Stout both being rejected.
Homecomers do not know whether
Lieut. Marx will retain command or
if the members who passed the cxani-
nation with him will be placed with
other federal troops.
The list of those rejected follows:
G. M. Raudabaugh, L. Stout, L.
Engel. L. Coombs, J. Clawson, L.

H. Cook. J. Hdnsacker, F. Yaney, K.
McKelsey, Atkinson.
Reports are current that married
men remaining with the troops will
soon be sent home on the strer yth of
a ruling that there are sufficient un
married men enlistel for the present
need.
