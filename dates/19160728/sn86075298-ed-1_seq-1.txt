SIXTEEN MEN
CAUGHT IN BLAST
ALL BELIEVED TO BE DEAD
Cleveland, July 25.-Imprisoned in
the new water works tunnel under
Lake Erie after a terrible explosion
of gas in the tube, sixteen men are
believed to be dead.
The blast occurred shortly before
midnight and lifesavers and the
crews of the fire tugs rushed eo the
outer crib, five miles from shore with
lung motors, prepared to enter the tun"
nel and rescue the victims if alive.
That any survived the gas explosion
is considered improbable. Arrange
mients have been made to receive the
bodies of the tunnel workers.

JUDGE LENIZ DISMISSES
WRIT OF BABAES CORPUS
Last week the Pioneer told of the
issuance of writ of habeas corpus tby
Judge Duncan of the Missoula district
court, on the application of John Lind
say for the possession of his wife
Alma Lindsay, formerly Alma Kaiser.
These parties were married in KaliL
spell on July 10 and made a trip to
Spokane by auto, where the former re
gistered for the Colville drawing.
They arrived at 'the home of Geo.
Lindsay on the big flat un Friday foL
lowing and stayed at the home of the
groom's parents until Sunday July, 16,
at which time Louis Kaiser, father of
the bride sent to the Lindsay home
and induced his daughter to go back
to the Kaiser home, the bride saying
to her husband to come and get her
later in the day. This he attempted
to do, but was not permitted to enter
the premises of his father-in-law nor
allowed to see his wife. An applica
tion to the court followed and a writ
of habeas corpus was served by De
puty sheriff Engle, citing the father
and mother of the bride to have her
in court at Missoula on Friday last at
10 o'clock. a. m.
After hearing all the evidence sub
mitted on both sides Judge Lentz be
fore whom the hearing was held, dis
missed the writ.
The evidence showed that the bride,
for some unknown reason, had chang
ed her mind about living with her
husband and refused to see and talk
with him and declared that she did
not intend to longer live with him,
saying when asked why she married
him to desert him so soon, that she
considered it simply a joke.
The young husband felt that it was
his duty to ascertain if possible why
he was abruptly deserted and offered
to receive her back and treat her as
a husband should, but his offer was
scorned and rejected.
The matter is the subject of much
discussion in the neighborhood, but no
criticism is heard of the husband.

ALL-STAS WIN
DOUBLE HE&DER~
The Ronan All Stars won both
games of a double header played on
I the Ronan diamond last Sunday. The
first game was at 11 o'clock in the
morning, with the Mision Reds, and it
was loosely played on both sides, with
the Reds drawing the losing end by a
score of 16 to 7.
Joe White went in to pitch for the
All Stars and retired after the second
inning in favor of Benny Hull. Joe's
arm went on the bum early in the sea
Lson and he thought it was back in
form but two innings convinced him
otherwise. The Reds made only one
run off his delivery but a sore arm
needs care. Benny Hull pitched good
enough ball to have earned a shut
out but errors allowed six runners to
cross the plake. Phil Hull pitched
the last two innings and of the six
men to face him he struck out ive.
The Reds used three slab artists aL
so, Peon taking the first turn and was
bombarded so hard he retired in favor
of Campbell, who met with a like fate
and then Archie McDonald went un
and he had but very little better luck.
The All Stars scored at will and loaf
ed enough of the time to permit seven
scores to be chalked up against them.
Joe Allard umpired to the satisfaction
of both sides.

ed on both sides, but the counter
jumpers were no match for the All
Stars. They were a game lot of
sports, however, and no matter how
hard they were joshed stood the gaff
and only smiled. Tucker pitched the
full nine inning and while he was hit
for 14 safe ones, had his support been
a little more active the result would
have been closer. The All Stars stole
bases at will, and really played the
best game so far this season. Wood
started the game for Ronan and pitch
ed the first five innings and then Phil
Hull went in and finished the game.
Of the 'ten hits made by Kalispell eight
were off Wood and two off Hull, one
of which counted as a home run for
the reason the ball was lost in the
high grass near the left field fence.
While the hits were numerous in the
first five innings they were scattered
and did not result in scoring many
runs.

Manager Carper put on a bucking
contest after the two games were over

out a big crowd. It looked like a
celebration in town that afternoon and
- the crowd was well pleased over the
entertainment. Four riders entered
the contest for the purse and after all
the fun was over the judges divided
the money between Pete Roethler and

good exhibition of bucking and the

TO REDUCTIONS
CHAMBERLAIN IS AROUSED
Washington, July 25.-The senate
called a halt on wholesale reduction
begun Saturday in the army appro.
priation bill, voting down retrench.
ment proposals and approving in
creases totaling more than $30,000,000
when sections were reached carrying
provision for ordnance and equipment
for the regular army and national
guard.
Debate on the ordnance sections de
veloped a predominating sentiment
that it would be unwise to limit ex
penditures for ammunition and guns
too closely despite the lessening of
tension in the Mexican situation.
Decreases of $36,000,000 ordered Sat
urday related to transportation, sub
sistence, foreign service pay and emer
gency estimate put into the bill by
the house when the Mexican situation
was critical.
The increases included:
For medical supplies, increase front
$2,000,000 to $4,500,000; engineers'
equipment, $1,000,000 to $1,770,000;
ordnance stores, $6,000,000 to $11,
000,000; automatic machine guns for
regular army, $3,600,000 to $7,725,000;
automatic machine guns, for national
guard, $2,000,000 to $6,586,150; armor
ed motor cars, $300,000 to $1,000,000;
field artillery for national guard, $8,
000,000 to $14,200,000.
Several important items remain for
consideration, including the $13,281,
666 proposed for aviation, an increase
1 of $10,000,000 over the house appro
I priation.
In the debate Chairman Chamber
lain of the military committee, aroused
by anti-preparedness arguments by
e Senator Norris, vehemently arraigned
senator* who, he declared, constantly
5 intimated that advocates of prepared
ness were in a conspiracy with muni
i tlons makers and others who profit by
Ywar. ý.
He defended the patriotism and hon
esty of the champions of preparednss
ein congress.
Senator Townsend assailed the ad
ministration Mexican policy, asserting
that the national guard had been call
ed to the border under "false pre
tenses" and that diplomatic corre
spondence had disclosed that there
never was any intention of sending
state troops into Mexico.
