work during the past year was j have Mr Riggins as their author
He is also the originator of the
Trustee Organization an idea
that has brought untold benefit
to the schools of his own county
and which has since been adopted
by other counties in the State
If it were only a good school
man we were looking for the
task would not seem so hard but
we must find coupled with the
qualities of a good school man a
man of business ability since he
has to do with a great deal of the
taxpayers money He also has
to do very greatly with the future
citizenship of our country on the
one hand and the life or the
death the freedom or tho incar
ceration of those the courts have
found guilty of crime on the other
hand since the State Superin
tendent of Public Instruction is
by law a member of the Board of
Pardons and Paroles
Mr Riggins education his
long experience in school work
his business ability his calm de
