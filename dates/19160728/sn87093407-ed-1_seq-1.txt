2 YEARS Of WAR SHOW MILITARISM WILL DIE,
BUT THAT GERMANY, AS A NATION, WILL LIVE
Noted American Expert on European War
Militarism is in its death throes as the second year of the
war closes. It is fighting on the defensive, and is approach
ing inevitable surrender.
The allies have demonstrated that they MUST continue
the conflict indefinitely to defeat the militarists of Germany.
There are signs that the (ierman |>eople are realizing this
fact, and, to save their empire, eventOally will refuse to accept
the policies of professional soldiers.
This is the main result of Europe's two years of warfare:
Germany will survive the war; but Prus
sian MILITARISM WILL NOT.
The second year of the conflict hit given the central em
ptre* a stronger territorial hold on Russia. and has i«m the
complete conquest of Serbia It ha* also witnessed a Isrge
victory tn Asia Minor bjr Russia, and the loss to Germany
of almost all that remained of her colonial empire

WAR GAME TIED IN BTH INNING
It is the last of the eighth inning, with the score tied, 17 to 17. The tie score
may carry over the ninth inning, but there are signs that the German battery is going
up in the air, with no substitutes to send in—and starvation, the allies" heaviest hitter,
is next at bat.
Dividing the war game into inning* according to the principal phases thru which
has passed, and in each inning giving each side as many points as its successes are
u-orth according to a fixed scale, the box score stands about as follows:
f 123456789 10 11
\ GERMANY ...7 1 0 1 4 2 2 0
ALLIES 2 1 2 2 2 3 3 2
The score by innings:
/FIRST —Germany, first at bat, gets Belgium and northern France; allies defeat
Germans at the Marne, and enter East Prussia. Score, 7 to 2.
SECOND —German* drive Russians out of East Prusels; allies block German drive at Calais.
Score, 1 to 1.

Warsaw. Score, 2te 0, for allies.

«Ith fortitude, and In fact, with pride, because her armies were
winning succeasna In east and west. Now, however, the pos
sibility of gaining further field successes which can have any
aerlous meaning for Germany has vanished.
Hereafter, certainly two and possibly three Germans are des
tined to fall for each single casualty In the ranks of any one
of the three nations that are stacking the German fronts.
These are the fact* that point to the coming collapse of
Prussian militarism. The diplomats of the allies have assisted
In the work by announcing they have no desire to crush Ger
many. The militarists, therefore, are unable to urge their
conquering Ideals upon civilian public opinion an the only alter
native to the blotting out of the German nation.
How soon the inevitable overthrow of the militarists will
happen cannot be foretold. The degree of persistence with
which the allies continue their attache will have much Influ
ence on the quick strengthening of civilian opinion in Germany.
The growth of this opinion and its gradual eeiiure of
power In Berlin will be the most Important factor to watch In
belligerent natlone, during the third year of the war.
It Is destined to bring the war to an end on the grave of
Prussian militarism, after which It may begin the creation of a
new Germany for the future.
