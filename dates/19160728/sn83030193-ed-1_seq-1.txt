Fears of the police that rioting in the strike against the Union Street
Railway Company in the Uronx would be renewed were justified this
afternoon by a running battle on Westchester Avenue from Prospect
Avenue to Cattldwell Avenue in which stones were thrown in showers
and many heads were broken by police clubs.

Deutschland prepared to-day to take
nn a pilot from tho Maryland Pilots'
Association, but that organisation
said Owen Coleman, who brought her
up river, was out of town, and not
ImmodlaMy available for service.
Whllo Cnpt. Zack Culllson of tho
tug Tlmmlns wants Coleman, the
rules of the association require that
vessels tako "tho first man out" the
tlrst man on tho pilot list.
A twenty-four-hour crow Is aboard
tho Tlmmlns, giving the Impression
that tho stay of tho .Deutschland Is
not long and that when she dues head
out sho may plan a layover In the
lower bay beforo trying to run tho
ullled patrol.
Watchers aboard tho Herman sub-
murine freighter Dcutschland want to
sco tho ships of England go.
They fear that a plan Is afoot to
hnvo vessels In ballast In the harbor
follow tho Deutschland out to the
Cnpes and "accidentally" ram her.
ThlB would save the allied patrol a
big task, tand, as one of the Oermans
put It, tho Britisher could say, "Oh,
I beg ,'ardont I will pay you dam
ages."
This foar Is bcllovod to havo been
the compelling motives behind orders
tj delay tho Doutschland'u departure.
Tho Uroinen, however, U a vital
factor. Stories that she has been cap

"Uah, she is not lost until three or

ISpMiUI In Th KfrnMI WrM,)
ALBANY, July M.-Oov. Whitman
to-day refused to Interfero In any
way with the execution of Charles
Htlelow, sentenced to die in the chair
at ttlng Sing to-morrow for the mur
der of Charles Phelps, a farmer, and
his housekeeper, Margaret Wolcott,
at Medina, N, Y In April, 1915.
A pathetic appeal for a further re
prleve wasmada,to tho Oovernor by
ta thtrtitri-year-old daughter ot
Btlelow, who declared her father was
at horns on tha night ot the double
murder and could not havo had any
part In tho crime.
Stlelow's wife and two other of his
children added their pleadings for the
condemned man and lawyer David
A. White of Buffalo, Stlulow'a attor
ney, fnado a presentation ot new de
velopments In tho case, but Qov.
Whitman said ho could not act.
Tho Oovcrnor rulod that the llttlo
girl's evidence was corroborative and
threw no new light on the crime. A
claim mado by Lawyer Wright that
Btlelow was mentally doflclcnt did
not lmproAs Whitman.
Mrs. Btlelow and her children were
brought to Albany from their homo
up-stnto by Luwyvr Whlto with
money contributed by convicts In
Sing Blng. The follow prisoners of
Btlelow collected $40 In an effort to
express their sytnputhy for the con
demned man. They sent this money
to White saying It would help pay
the fare of the mother and llttlo ones
to Bins Sing to pay a last farewell
to the husband nnd father.
After to-dny"s hearing Lawyer
White with the Btlelow family took
a train south to Blng Blng.
MEDINA, N. Y July !s Charles
Btlelow's wife and other women In
terested In his case spoke at a mass
meeting here yesterday to a-nutt. public
opinion. The speakers Included Inei
Hllholland-llolssevaln, Stuart Kohn, Mrs.
Orace Humlslon, who has worked untlr
Inxly to obtain the condemned man's re
lease, and Mlsha Appleuaum, leader of
the Humanitarian Cult.
Mrs. Humlston said, after Justice
Cole of nuffalo had denied the motion
for a new trial WcdnesUsy:
"Justlco Cola seemed disposed to be
lieve that every affidavit In favor of
Stlelow was false and that those fight
ing for his death were all truthful. The
light to bring the guilty ones to Justice
will go on even If Btlelow Is executed,
and the State will be shocked by the
resultant disclosures. The people's
case rests upon an untrue confession
that Is replete with absurdities and
Incongrultlss."
