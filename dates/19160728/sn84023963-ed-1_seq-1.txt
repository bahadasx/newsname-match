TRICK SHOOTING.
Th Way Some of tho Stage Feats Art
Accomplished.
When a champion nfle shot fires
blindfolded at a wedding ring or a
penny held between his wife's
thumb and finger or seated back to
her shoots, by means of a nurror, at
an apple upon her head or on a
fork held in her teeth, the danger
of using a bullet is obvious. iSFone,
of course, is needed. The explo
sion is enough. The apple is al
ready prepared, having been cut!
into pieces and stuck together withfj
an adhesive substance, and a thread J
with a knot at thev end, pulled?
through it from the "wings," soj
that it flies to bits when the gun ia
fired, is "how it is done." -Generally
the more dangerous a
feat appears the more carefully is
all danger guarded against. In the
"William Tell" act the thread isr
often tied to the assistanta foot.
When, again, the ash is shot off a
cigar which the assistant is smok
ing a piece -of wire is pushed by his
tongue through a hollow passage in
the cigar, thus thrusting off the ash
at the moment of firing.
A favorite but simple trick is the
shooting from some distance at an
orange held in a lady's hand. Great
I applause is invariably forthcoming
when the bullet drops out on her
cutting open the fruit. It is insert
ed by hand earlier in the evening.
Another popular trick is that of
snuffing out lighted candles. Half
a dozen are placed in front of a
screen, in which as many small
holes are bored, one against each
candle wick. At the moment of
firing a confederate behind, the
screen sharply blows out each can
dle with a pair of bellows.
In most instances where a ball or
other object has to be "broken oij a
living person's head blank r -tridge
is used and the efTect pro
duced by other means. A special'
wig with a spring concealed in it
worked by a wire under the clothes
is generally used, the confederate
manipulating the spring simulta
neously wMh tho firing of the rifle.
As the ball is of extremely thin
glass, a mere touch suffices to shat
ter it.
In these exhibitions some of the
rifle "experts" invito gentlcMien
from the audience to testify that
the weapon is indeed loaded. Tho
cartridge shown looks very well, but
it is a shell of this wax Blackened
to resemble a lefden bullet. St

Bits. Bruce's Mother.
The inspector .was examining
standard 1, and all the class had
been specially told beforehand by
their master, "Don't, answer imlesa
you are almost certain your answer
Is correct."
History was the subject. j
"!Now, tell me," said the inspect
or, ""who was the mother of our
great Scottish hero, Robert Bruce?"
He pointed to the top boy, then
around tho class. There was no
answer. Then at last the heart of
the teacher of that class leaped with
joy5 The boy who was standing at
the very foot had held up his hand.
"Well' my boy," ßaid the in
Bpector encouragingly, "who waa
the ?"
"Please, six, Mrs. Bruce."
Why H BoltecL
'At one of the London clubs on
evening Mr. Montagu Williams metf
Lord , who had just lost his fa
ther. The young lord was naturally
melancholy, and the lawyer pro
posed visiting a theater opposite,
which proposition wa3 accepted.
There was a slight fire in the thea-
ter, whereupon the young lord waaj
among tho first to bojt, "like a rab
bit," out of the building. Return
ing leirurelv to the club, Mr. Wil
liams found there his young friend,
quietly smoking a cigar.
"What on earth made you bolti
that way? You seemed frightened
out of your wits (not a difficult mat
ter perhaps). Don't 3011 know that
on such an occasion if everybody
got up and rushed out a panic would
ensue., with very likely fatal conse
quences ? Why on earth couldn't
you ?'A still, as I did? There was
nothing serious the matter." Upon
this, with the most patronizing air,,
the young gentleman replied, "Oh,
ye's, that's very well for you, but;
you've not just succeeded to a pw-
age and 20,000 a year." ' - j
