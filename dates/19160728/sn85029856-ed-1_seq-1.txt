SHERIFF OF MORTON COUNTY
KILLED
Quite a little excitement was
stirred up all over southwestern Kan
sas Sunday afternoon when It became
known that Sheriff Martin' Moore ot
Morton county had been killed by
Bon Wormer, a real estate man of
Holla. The prisoner was brought to
Liberal Sunday afternoon and placed
In the Seward county Jail, but threats
ot violence were heard In Morton
county and Monday afternoon sever
al deputy sheriffs from that county
came over and took Van Wormer to
the Hamilton county Jail at Syracuse.
The following account of the tragedy,
under a Dodge City date line, ap
peared in Monday's issue ot the To
peka Capital, and seems to be accur
ate so far as we have been able to
ascertain:
"Officials ot Morton county are in
conflict and the operation of the law
has been practically suspended as a
result of the slaying at Rolla, Satur
day night, ot Sheriff Martin Moore.
"Don Van Wormer, a rolla real es-
tate man, has been spirited out ot'
Morton county to safe keeping In the
Jail in Hugoton, Stevens county, and
two other men whom one faction in
the county want arrested as accom
plices of Van Wormer in the slaying
ot Moore are still at large through
the failure of other county officials to
Issue warrants for them.
"The slaying of the sheriff follows
a conflict over authority between a
constable and the sheriff's office.
About 5 o'clock Saturday afternoon
Van Wormer went to his room to lie
down for a nap. He was annoyed by
the noise ot a flock of guinea hens be
longing to a neighbor and he stepped
to a rear door and took a shot at
them. Some of the shot from his
sun struck a man passing the house.
This man complained to the sheriff,
who attempted to arrest Van Wor
mer without a warrant. Van Wor
mer refused to accompany the officer,
who returned to a justice's office for
a warrant. While he was gone a con
stable secured a warrant In another
justice's office, went to Van Wor
ker's office- and arrested him.. He
left the prisoner at the office of the
Justice in charge of two deputies and
went in search of the Justice to give
Van Wormer a hearing. In his ab
sence Sheriff Moore arrived with an
other warrant, deputized 'the two
deputy constables as deputy sheriffs
and dragged Van Wormer out of the
office.
"Outside, it is charged, one ot the
deputies struck the sheriff, the pris
oner escaped back to the office, seized
a revolver and shot the sheriff
through the head as he came back
after him. Moore died instantly. The
county attorney is out of the' county
and other officials have refused to is
sue warrants for the two deputy con
stables. "A telegram to the attorney gener
al signed by twelve men of Morton
county was received by W. P. Mont
gomery, assistant attorney general.
The telegram stated that the county
attorney is absent from the county
and on account of the complicated

MAY INSTALL NEW SWITCH
BOARD Secretary Broadwell ot the Cham
ber of Commerce was circulating a
petition the last of the week among
the business firms and patrons of the
Liberal Telephone Company, request
ing the Public Utilities Commission
to allow the Telephone company to
raise its present rates, provided the
company installs a multiple switch
board and common battery service.
This kind ot a switchboard would
necessitate a complete overhauling of
the system, installation of new
phones everywhere there is one now
in use, and would obviate the ne
cessity ot ringing central every time
you desired to talk. A sample switch
board Is now on display at the Land
Thayer real estate office, where it will
be demonstrated to anyone desiring
to investigate the merits of the same.
The new system would do away with

much inconvenience now contended
wjth by both the public and the op
erators, and would apparently be a
fine thing for the town. Its Installa
tion would come to at least $15,000
to $25,000, but Mr. Stevesson says
he is willing to make the change if
the people ot the town desire it and
will stand the raise in rates. The
new rates would be $2.60 per month
for business houses; $1.50 per month
for residences, and $1.25 per month
for two-party line service. The town
has outgrown the present system and
would have to come to the new ar
rangement in a few years anyway, so
the company figures it might as well
Install It now as later on. If the deal
Is made it will be a splendid forward
step in the progress ot Liberal, and
would speak well for Mr. Stevesson's
efforts in giving the town the best
service that money can buy.
Later Since the above was writ
ten a deal has been closed by the
company and the new switchboard is
assured. It is expected to have the
same installed and in operation some
time In September.
ADVERTISING LIBERAL IN
COLORADO
Twenty-two Liberal people who
are now enjoying the balmy moun
tain breezes of Manltou and Colorado
Springs, Colorado, gathered together
last Friday, so the report comes to
Liberal, and held a picnic at Stratton
Park, near Colorado Springs. Lib
eral is well represented inColorado
this year, and were they all in one
place at the same time it would make
quite a colony. Incidentally, they
never fall to let the stranger know
from whence they hall, and the town
should get considerable good adver
tising from those who are tempor
arily sojourning in the wilds of the
Rocky Mountains.
EX-QOV. HOCH TO BE HERE
Ex-Oovernor E. W. Hoch of Kan
sas will speak at the Chautauqua
next Friday, either afternoon or
night. Mr. Hoch was governor of
Kansas In 1903 and 1904 and the
state made progressive strides in a
legislative way during his adminis
tration. He is one of the big men
of the country and will have a mes
sage for his hearers that will be
worth coming miles to hear.'

BAND CONCERTS BEGIN AUG. 2
The Liberal Band will begin i
series ot concerts - on Wednesday,
AugUBt 2nd. It has not yet been de
cided how long these concerts will
be given, but they will probably con
tinue until some time in September.
It was the intention at first to have
these concerts on Saturday nights but
owing to the fact that more than half
of the band boys are engaged In busi
ness which requires them to work on
Saturday night, this plan had to be
given up. The concerts will be held
on one ot the three central street
corners every Wednesday, changing
each week. They will begin at 8
o'clock and It is the desire of the
band that the merchants make the
fact known to their trade and have
a large crowd out on these occasions.
The band Is Improving rapidly under
the supervision of Director Reasoner,
and Liberal will soon have oue ot the
best bands in Kansas.
CHAUTAUQUA TICKETS ON SALE
At a meeting ot the Chautauqua
Board Tuesday morning It was decid
ed to conduct the ticket-selling cam
paign by a number ot teams. Each
team has a captain who Is responsible
for the sale of the tickets. The fol
lowing men were elected captains:
Chaa. Taylor, Frank Boles, Tom Te
garden, G. L. Light, Clyde Atha, and
W. H. Meyer. The ticket sale has
started out briskly and promises to
far over-reach last year's advance
sale.
NEW APPARATUS FOR PLAY.
GROUND
During the past week some new
apparatus has been supplied for the
playground. It consists of a log
swing and a trolley with pulley at
tachment. The attendance at the playground
Is steadily increasing and the boys
and girls are getting some healthful
Instruction. If your children have
not been attending the classes at the
playground, start them in as it will
be time well spent.
BABY ACCIDENTALLY KILLED
Leslie, the year old baby ot Mr.
and Mrs. George Tuman, who live
about seven miles southeast of Lib
eral, was accidentally killed last Fri
day by the wheel of a wheat wagon
passing over one side of its head. The
little fellow was under the wagon and
its whereabouts was unknown to the
driver, who thought it was with the
other children near the house. The
baby only lived about ah hour after
the accident. Interment was made
In the Lorena cemetery. This acci
dent is a severs shock to the parents
ana is deeply regrette by everyone.
ORDINANCE COMMITTEE BUSY
The ordinance oommlttee, recently
appointed by the Cbamber-of Com
merce, composed of E. J. Thayer, G.
L. Light, and Joe Fuest, Is making a
thorough canvass of the business dis
trict of the town In .order to get the
opinion of the business men regard
ing the parking ordinance. These
men are calling on the merchants
BOUND OVER TWO "STICK-UP '
MEN '
Two young men, giving their names
as Dick Wisdom and Henry Crason,
in company with two other fellows
who got away, held up two men at
the depot on Thursday night of last
week, robbing one of $4.80 and get
ting some valuables from both. They
also held up J. W. Elliott, the night '
watchman, but took nothing from
him. The two parties held up were
strangers here and gave their names
as Lee and Morgan. They notified
Sheriff Dobson and he started hunt
ing for them at once, but they had
walked to the cut west ot town and
boarded a freight that happened to
be running at low speed while mak
ing the hill. Word was sent to the
different towns to watch for them
and the sheriff at Dalhart nabbed
them as soon as they landed. Sheriff
Dobson went to Dalhart Sunday and ,
brought the boys back the next day.
Their preliminary was held Tuesday
before Judge D. C. Wood, who found
them guilty and bound them over to
the district court In the sum of $500,
which they were unable to furnish.
They will have to lay it out In jail
until district court convenes next
fall. Owing to the nature of their
crime they will undoubtedly get a
chance to "make little ones out ot
big ones" at Lansing before they get
through with the deal.
POUNDING OUT WHEAT
The writer of these lines enjoyed a
short ride Into the country a tew
miles northeast of Liberal Wednes
day In Qulncy Holland's car. Quincy
wanted to show us how a real thresh
ing outfit looked when In operation,
and we must acknowledge that the
outfit looked like It meant business.
The Holland machine Is knocking
out about 2,500 bushels every day,
and if that gait Is continued a couple
of months It ought to make a con
siderable dent in the wheat stacks
over the country, when you consider
the number of other machines in op
eration. The wheat is making the
best test this year ot any in the his
tory of the country lots of it going
to 64 pounds per bushel and the
kernel is well filled and rounded out.
With the price a little better than a
dollar per bushel the farmers should
begin looking around for safes to
store their money until they can
come to town to bank it. The Hol
land boys are running their machine
with a set of Questions which brines
out their ideas concerning the ordin-!,or tne thlr(1 iett8on and nave made
ance and the answers will be tabulat
ed and the ordinance drawn from the
result of this record. These men are
working hard on this proposition,
have a difficult job before them and
should receive the co-operation of all
the business men.
Fred Powell, one of the proprie
tors of the Pullman Cafe, sold his In
terest in that Institution the last of
the week to his partner, L. E. Maug
ham, and left for Kiowa, Kansas.
Mrs. Powell's health has not been the
best since locating here and It was
tor that reason the change was
deemed necessary.
good money out of the outfit every
year, too, something every owner ot
a rig cannot show.

Mrs. W. N. Wright, died Friday. She
was born October 19, 1904, and was
11 years, 9 months and 3 days old

seriously 111 tor about ten days pre
ceding her death. Funeral services
were conducted at the home Satur
