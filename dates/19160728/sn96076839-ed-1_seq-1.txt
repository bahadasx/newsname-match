Family Affairs '
Worry Soldiers
DONT KNOW WHETHER
WIVES HAVE FOOD
No European Nation Would
Tolerate Such Conditions, ,
Says War Correspondent
San Antonio, Texas, July 24. Not
one soldier that I rubbed elebows with
in all the armies of Europe in the last
two years ever worried as some of
these American soldiers along the edge
of Mexico, says W. G. Shepard, war
correspondent.
These Americans I refer to are
worrying about their families back
home; they don't know whether their
wives and children have enough to
eat. Such a deplorable situation could
not possibly exist in any European
army, for European governments cares
for the families of their soldiers.
The Mexican government doesn't;
we don't. I've talked with hundreds
Vf soldiers of six different armies in
Europe. I talked today with my first
soldier of the new American armies.
I talked to Europeans in artillery pits,
trenches and dugouts, but I talked
with the American in a Jitney going
from San Antonio to the army post.
If the Germans knew Britishers were
treating the families of their soldiers as
we are treating ours, or vice versa, the
fact would be blazoned world-wide as
an indication of governmental cruelty
by the enemy. It's not cruelty on our
part, only oversight, and the lesson
we've learned has cost unhappiness
and embarrassment in many American
homes.
If an American correspondent learn
ed from a British soldier what I learned
from Frank Shepkowski, my first
American soldier today, he would
break the British censorship to get the
story to the world. Shepkowski, of
Company II, Second division Illinois
Infantry, will march up the steps of his
little home at 14.72 Emma street, .North
Chicago, within a couple of days, give
his wife a hug and say, "Well, I'm
home." He's got a check from Uncle
Sam for $G7.72 and if he's careful after
paying his fare he ought to have about
$20 to hand over to Mrs. Shepkowski.
He was born in Poland but has served
in the militia six years and his term c'
enlistment expired today, his militia
career winding up with a blazing two
weeks' holiday here in Texas.
It was from Shepkowski that I got
my first inkling that thousands of
Americans here who were snatched
suddenly from their families in the
little breeze of war which struck Amer
ica three weeks ago are worrying about
folks back home and wondering wheth
er they are getting food and other
necessities of life.
"It wasn't so bad with me," said
Shepkowski, "because my wife was a
dressmaker and I could quit my glove
cutter's job and go to the front without
her starving, but there are lots of fel
lows whose wives don't work and
they're worried stiff."
There were thousands of tragedies,
as grim as many in Europe, in Ameri
can homes three weeks ago which are
just coming to light here on the border.
Gen. Funston and his staff officers are
hearing them. Shepkowski put his fin
ger on the greatest present fault with
the American army plan.
Can a man be a good soldier and do
good work if he's wondering whether
his family at home has enough to eat?"
I asked General Funston, after leav
ing the jitney, and making my way to
his hot office.
The general, whose perspiring head
was leaving patches of dampness on
the leather back of the huge chair in
which he sat, leaned forward, saying
earnestly: "Of course not. I permitted
fourteen men to return home yester
day because their dependents were
suffering and I have so many requests
for relief yi like grounds that it will
prove necessary to release several
thousands within the next few weeks.
These men are given three and a
half cents mileage homeward. Money
which has been spent in bringing them
to the border, feeding them and out
fitting them, and then after two weeks
sending them back home, isn't wasted
It is our payment for the lesson that
-Jn our new army plan we must provide
Avell for the care of soldiers' families if
we are going to insist on taking men
away from their families into the army
"What about my family?" is the big
gest question in all militia camps along
the border.
Tag Day
in East Jordan
WILL BE HELD THIS SAT-
URDAY. JULY 29th.
For Benefit of the Michigan Child
Welfare League to Aid the
Crippled Children.
TO THE CITIZENS
OF EAST JORDAN.
I have given the Michigan Child Wel
fare League permission to have a "Tag
Day" Sale in East Jordan, baturday
July 29, 191G. The work is a most com
mendable one and worthy of the sup
port of all communities in Michigan.
Yours for the Children,
A. E. CROSS, Mayor
The Michigan Child Welfare League
is doing a much needed work through
out the State and is demonstrating that
it is not necessary for a child to go
through life dependent on the charity
of others because of physical handicap.
The society seeks out these crippled
children, often in the most isolated
portions of the State, and sees to it
that they have medical and surgical aid
which fits them to be self supporting
in the years to come. The organiza
tion works with the family as a unit,
and every effort is made to hold fami
lies together where poverty is the
principal cause for separation of child
ren from parents. Aid is given tem
porarily while the home is in the pro
cess of reconstruction and plans are
being worked out to bring the family
back to a normal mode of living.
During the past year 188 families,
which otherwise would have been bro
ken up and separated, have by means
of the League been kept together; hos
pital treatment has been furnished 88
children; over 100 mothers have been
helped with their children; work has
been provided for parents; clothing
furnished and pension relief secured
for needy mothers. A total of 9G4
children have been benefited and help
ed during the past year.
Local committees will be assisted by
Mrs. Mildred B. Kennedy, District
Superintendent.
GRAFF FAMILY REUNION
AN ENJOYABLE AFFAIR
The annual reunion of the Graff
family was held on Saturday and Sun
day last at the farm homes of J. II.
Graff and his sister, Mrs. Samuel Per
sons, in South Arm township.
Nearly fifty members of the Graff
family were in attendance and it was
one of the most enjoyable events ever
held by that family. Next year they
will meet at Grand Rapids. The entire
family was present with the exception
of a brother, G. F. Graff of Chicago and
a sister, Mrs. McCaul of Grand Rapids.
Among those from out-of-town at
tending were W. T. Lancaster, wife
and family of Oden; Charles Sydel,
wife and family of Grand Rapids, ac.
companied by Miss Beth Long; Paul
Nemice and wife of Traverse City; Roy
Crothers of Kalkaska; and Guy Graff of
Rogers City accompanied by a couple
of lady friends.
WHY WE NEED
GOOD ROADS
To attract tourists, who spend loads
of money wherever they go. At the
meeting of Mackinac, it was estimated
that 100,000 cars owned outside the
state visit Michigan annually, leaving
an average of $50.00 per car. This is a
good deal of money and the better the
roads the more cars will come and the
greater the sum of money left in our
State. Prices of land will advance and
the results will be the same here as in
other places general prosperity will
reigh.
If you don't go away from jour farm
or your own city, what do you know
about what your neighbors are doing.
We are living in an age of progress
and progress means prosperity. Char
levoix County is destined to be the
Mecca of tourists. We have the climate
we have the scenery and we have the
fruit with flavor. All we need is per
manent roads to attract them here and
when once here, we stand a mighty
good chance of keeping them here, or
else having them pay us yearly visits.
When you build a road,build the main
tenance into the road at the beginning
and not keep up a lot of patchwork.

WALLOON LAKE CASE
OUT OF COURT
Long Standing Dispute About
Water Level Now Settled.
Last week at the invitation of Rep
resentative D. H. Hinkley, parties to
the Walloon Lake litigation met at his
office and came to a mutual agreement
which will for all time end this con
troversy. This case which is now in
United States .court, involved the
height of the water in Walloon lake.
The McManus interests and other
parties contesting for a lower level, and
the Walloon Lake interests advocating
a higher level. It has been expensive
and costly to both parties, and has
created a feeling which heretofore has
been detrimental to the welfare of
each. Realizing that prolonging this
matter was a handicap to both the con
ference was arranged. Concessions
were made by both side, and a com
mendable compromise spirit shown,
which resulted in a final agreement,
the details of which were kept private.
Judge Sessions of the United States
court, before whom the matter was
legally, has placed his official approval
on the settlement. '
This abrupt end of the suit will be
received with favor by the general
public and will be the beginning of a
better feeling all around. To Messrs
McManus credit should be given for
a generous willingness to do their part
toward ending the matter, having part
ly sacrificed their personal interests
for the good of the general public.
Messrs. Dick and McKercher, who
handled the Walloon Lake end, are to
be credited with coming through on
their part and conceding some of the
items for which they have always con
tended. Petoskey News.
THE VALUE OF TREES
ALONG A HIGHWAY
A letter from Atlanta, Georgia, on
Dixie Highway matters calls my atten
tion to many very beautiful places
throughout the middle and southern
end of this celebrated highway, which
runs along the entire west side of
Charlevoix County and is destined to
become a national highway between
the North and South.
The Daughters of the Confederacy
have promised to line this highway, en
tirely across the County of Putnam,
Ga., with flowers and shrubbery. Just
think what that means for Putnam
County and then reflect for a moment
what it would mean to have a row of
apple trees along the roadside in front
of every farm in Charlevoix County.
The benefits derived from same by the
advanced valuation of farm property
would make this one of the very best
investments that anyone can make.
The tourists would talk about Charle
voix County all over the world.
One great difficulty in our country is
that our people have nice trees, or
have had them and the road commis
sioner, or old fashioned path master,
has deliberately and wantonly cut them
down, thereby destroying one great
beauty of our highways. I have seen
a farmer thin out and leave standing
some nice trees and then go to work
deliberately and fool-like to pile brush
in close proximity to one of the beauti
ful trees that he had intended to save,
set fire to the brush and destroy the
tree. We have all seen that done
time Ind time again. I have seen with
in the past years a row of beautiful
elms, eight to fourteen inches in dia
meter, cut and many of the trunks re
main by the roadside at the present
time. This is on one of the prettiest
viewpoints I know of in this country
and should a man wish to purchase the
place today, he would give at least
$500.00 more if that row of trees were
standing.
Some day, there will be a concrete
road past this man's house and some
rich man will give a big price, not so
much for the land as for the location.
Just keep right on thinking, good
people, along these lines and see what
it means to you in the future.
Yours truly,
GEORGE II. VAN PELT.
. Do You Sleep Enough?
Medical authorities are pretty well
agreed that eight hours of sleep is the
minimum required for the maintenance
of health, and all concede that the
brain worker needs more sleep than
the manual laborer. Habitual defici
ency of sleep will undermine the
strongest constitution.
Concrete Roads
An Asset
Van Pelt Gives Interesting In
terview with 0. 0. Stone.
O. 0. Stone, who is touring East and
West, Michigan Pike-Dixie Highway,
spenj Saturday in Charlevoix, the guest
of George H. Van Pelt.
Mr. Stone is a Good Roads enthusiast
of unusual interest and says he has
firmly been converted from mud, dust
and chuck-hole roads to hard . surface.
permanent roads, not only from the
pleasure and comfort to be enjoyed,
but from the every day, good business,
common sense view-point. The fol
lowing are a few statements he ex
pressed in his talk regarding good
roads:
The road question is a large problem
but not a hard one to solve, if we will
analyze it as we would our direct and
private affairs and by so doing we will
calculate benefit to be derived in a
community by the improvement. Next
we will figure post and find the cheaper
initial cost roads require annually large
expenditures for maintenance, which,
in a few years, exceeds cost of con
struction of concrete roads, and yields
not more than approximately sixty per
cent efficiency. We also discover that
at a greater initial cost concrete or
cement roads can be constructed, re
quiring but a very small expenditure
for maintenance and yields one hun
dred per cent efficiency, meaning a
number one, mudless, dustless, smooth
hard surface road, three hundred sixty-
five days in the year, and for years to
come, which should solve to the ques
tionable mind the economical type of
road to build; the one which improves
a community most and serves its pur
pose best.
While in your city today, my atten
tion was called to Concrete Pavement
at the South end of Bridge Street, op
posite the Hotel Michigan, laid seven
years ago and in number one condition
and am told has not reauired one
penny's worth of maintenance. This
evidence speaks mutely to you," Con
crete is King."
It might be well to refer to communi
ties older in road building Wayne
County (Detroit) for instance, to heed
the errors or profit by the success.
About eight years ago, Wayne County
built its first mile of concrete or cement
road, which today is in excellent con
dition and serving traffic upwards of
Four Thousand Vehicles Per Day, con
sisting of horse drawn wagons to five
ton auto trucks and each succeeding
year more has been built until, at the
present time, Wayne County contains
More Than One Hundred and Forty
Miles of Sixteen Foot Wide Concrete
Roads.
Wayne County's concrete roads have
not only attracted the attention of dif
ferent states of this country but differ
ent countries of Europe, who are pro
fiting by building likewise roads.
There is no other improvement which
adds quicker and greater value to the
farming community than does good
roads, as land and farm product value
are actually based on expense and time
horse power and general wear and tear
of transporting such products to the
railroad markets which explains why
farming lands of the same soil value
ten miles from a railway are not of as
much value as land one mile distant.
Now, let us note another important
factor, greatly aided by good roads,
greater attendance at church and at
school; a truer social hospitality; and
that every day touch of refinement
made more possible.
Picture in thought the great Dixie
Highway, beginning at Miami, Fla., ex
tending North through eight States, en
circling and paralelling the coast lines
of the Southern peninsula of the great
and grand State of Michigan, passing
through your City, "Charlevoix, the
Beautiful." What does it mean to you
and our great State? It unquestionably
means that your resorts will be visited
during the summer months by thous
ands of touring parties from the Dixie
land and it is well spoken when said,
"Michigan, the Summer Florida of
America."
Gentlemen, I was raised a farmer's
son, spent more than half my life on
the farm, and am today largely inter
osted in Michigan as a farmer and here
are a few facts which touch my quick
and arouse my ire:
Statistics from the State authorities
prove that, due to poor road conditions
it is Costing the Farmers of Michigan
Twenty-Six Cents Per Ton Mile ' to
Transport Their Product From Farm to
Railroad Station, While the Railroads
Transport the Same Product from load
ing station to destination For Six Mills
Per Ton Mile; something for us to think
of. I sincerely believe if the farmers,
bankers, merchants, professional men,
in fact all, will give the road question
good, sound-headed business thought,
we will soon get out of the . mud, dust
and chuck holes, lessen cost of trans
porting our farm products from plow to
railway, and thereby greatly increase
land value; more quickly settle the
farther back communities and in gener
al get on a higher plane of living."
I regard the statements made by Mr.
Stone as of inestimable value to every
tax payer in Charlevoix County. I took
him to drive on the Horton's Bay road
towards Boyne City and I expressed
myself that it was highway robbery for
the State of Michigan to pay $500.00 per
mile for the building of this road and
for the residents of Charlevoix County
to pay the balance, because this road is
virtually out of commission today.
Automobiles are here to stay. It is
the big automobiles that wear out our
country roads but they are the people
we want, because they are the people
who spend large sums of money here
and the fact is we derive a very large
sum of money, which is scattered broad
cast, and every man gets a whack at it,
from the man who sells an egg to the
one who sells a ton of hay. A concrete
road, such as is built on the South end
of Bridge Street and on Dixon Avenue,
would last fifty years and this road will
hardly last fifty weeks. Of course, it is
better than it used to be and that is the
one reason people feel encouraged, but
when they have to pay for the main
tenance, which will be a matter of three
or four hundred dollars per mile for a
few years and a good deal more a few
years afterwards, it is plain for any man
to see what the building of a concrete
road, with four foot shoulders of crush
ed stone, will mean to the tax payer.
Now, let's stop building any more
macadam roads, because they cannot
be built strong enough or durable
enough to stand the wear and tear of
these big automobiles and nothing else
will do it except concrete or brick and,
of course, brick are so costly that they
are out of the question.
Let all good praying people add,
"Give us concrete roads" and all who
are not praying, say, "We won't ac
cept anything but the concrete road."
