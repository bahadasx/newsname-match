ON NEUTRALITY DUTY
OFF VIRGINIA CAPES
American Warships Guarding tns
Throe Mile Zone,
.,,j& -;
Washington. July 27. Aroused by
an official report from tho commander
of the battleship Louisiana that a
mysterious ship, purporting to be a
British cruiser, had passed into the
mouth of the Chesapeake bay, the
navy department ordered the armored
cruiser North Carolina and three de
stroyers to neutrality duty off Cape
Henry.
Officials maintained unusual secrecy
regarding the matter and would not
disclose just what Instructions were
sent to the commander of the North
Carolina. It was assumed, however,
that he had been directed to see that
the German merchant submarine
Deutschland, now preparing for her
return trip to Germany, is not attack
ed by allied war vessels within the
three-mile limit and that American
neutrality Is not otherwise violated.
Unofficially navy officers agreed
that if the ship sighted from the
Louisiana was a British cruiser, the
commander of the vessel had been
guilty of a breach of naval practice
and had violated navigation laws In
cruising within American territorial
waters without proper lights. While
It was conceded that tho cruiser was
within her rights in entering terri
torial waters, provided she had ob
serwsd the rules, It was declared an
attempt to run Into the bay on a
scouting expedition and in disregard
of navigation laws would constitute a
gross violation of International cour
tesy. Infant Falls Two Stories.

ment is received no troops will move.

mander, announced. This ls provided

ON TWO FRONTS
Crifisti Capture Pozierre and
Russians Take Erzingan,

Eieres, while the Russian army oper
ating in Armenia drove tho Turks out
of Erzingan.
With the village of Pozieres com
pletely in their bands and having
strengthened their postion there by
tho capture of two strong trenches
west of the village, the British troops
seemingly are resting before attempt
ing again to throw their forces against
the Germans, who are blocking their
advance toward Bapaume.
South of the Somme the French
have recorded another success in the
taking of a fortified house, with some
prisoners, southeast of tho village of
'Estrees. Except in the Champagne,
where the artillery on both sides wa3
engaged in somewhat violent actions,
little fighting took place on the re
mainder of the French front
The 'Turks have evacuated Erzin
gan, in Turkish Armenia, and the Rus
sians are in possession of this import
ant strategic point. The reports of
tho evacuation have not mentioned ai
yet whether the- Turks, in their re
treat, were able to take away, in the
face of the rapid Russian advance,
the guns and stores in Erzingan.

pressure on the Teutonic allies in tho
Slonevka river region and also are at
tacking the Teutons In north Galicla,
near Brody. In the Slonevka district,
Petrograd says the Teutons are suffer
ing heavy casualties, and that more
than 4,000 men, five guns, six machine
guns and quantities of munitions "nave

cations are at variance concerning the
results 61 fighting that has taken

Baranovichi. Petrograd claims the
repulse of an offensive by Field Mar
shal Von Hlndenburg's men near
Riga, while Berlin asserts that the
Germans penetrated the Russian ad
vanced positions there and destroyed
them.
Likewise Petrograd claims a slight
gain for the Russians near Barano
vichi, while Berlin declares that
strong Russian attacks in this vicin
ity were put down with lieavy casual
ties. The German admiralty asserts that
a German submarine twice torpedoed
a British dreadnought off the Orkney
islands, Scotland, July 20, but the
British admiralty says the vessel at
tacked was a small auxiliary and that
