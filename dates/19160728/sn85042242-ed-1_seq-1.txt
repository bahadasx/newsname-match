Arm Themselves and Chase
Disturbers.
SEVERAL SHOTS
ARE EXCHANGED
I W. W. Gang Gets Very Bold
and Force Sherriff to Give
Up a Prisoner.
Ortonville, Minn., July 27 Orton­
ville citizens took up arms today
against an invasion of more than 300
I. W. W.'s and before the latter had
been driven from town a number of
shots had been fired.
Down in the "jungles" of the city
the idlers had been accumulating for
days all the professed I. W. W. ad­
herents. There had been some mi­
nor difficulties experienced because
of their presence, but the trouble did
not become serious until the arrest of
one of their numDer for begging. To­
day they thronged at the city lockup,
at first only 15 in number, who warn­
ed the authorities of dire results
should the incarceration of their mem­
bers continue. Then, when little at­
tention was paid to this small num­
ber, the I. W. W. "army" moved on
the jail in force. Fearing serious
trouble, with no means of combatting
it, the authorities released their pris­
oner and with his com "anions he re­
turned to "the jungles."
Aroused by this display of boldness,
between 350 and 400 citizens, mostly
business men, armed themselves with
everything, from shotguns to 'base­
ball bats, and set out upon a deter­
mined expedition to rid the city of
lt« oppressors.
Order Them to Leave Town.
They came upon the mob of 1. W.
W. followers, .numbering from 250 to
300, at the edge of the city, where
they had been in camp, and ordered
them to quit the town. Ajne mem­
ber o( the I. W. W. drew a revolver,
Mild pointing it at the citizens' posse,
threatened to shoot should the latter
tfvjtfqce.
'The citizen "army" did not pause.
Ashotw a:s fired by the I. W. W. and
from'the oncoming posse it brought a
response of about 25 shorts, all fired
eiver the heads of the invaders.
Stones were resorted to by many of
the I. W. W., but when baseball bats
began to flash in the sunlight, sup­
ported by a determined display of
other weapons, the army of invasion
lost heart, and their retreat soon be­
came a rout.
With their enemy vanquished, a
number of Ortonville men crossed the
Big Stone lake to Big Stone Citv,
where some trouble with I. W. W.
men had been reported. Here it was
found that about 50 business men had
rounded up about 75 Industrial Work­
ers and, assisted by the Ortonville
contingent, soon had them out of
sight of town.

Hold Up Freight Train.
Considerable trouble, due to the I.
W W., has been reported in this vi
cinity recently. Today a number of
that order held up St. Paul freight
trtin No. 63 near Eilbank, where they
also robbed four laboring men, who
had refused to join them.
FORM. PROTEST
WjUJE IADE
Ambassador Page Will Take Up
Matter of Black List With
Great Britain.
Washington, July 27.—American
Ambassador Page will present to the
British authorities tomorrow a note
protesting against the blacklisting of
American business firms in connec­
tion with the trading with the enemy
act. In announcing today that the
communication had been transmitted
to London, Acting Secretary Polk
said It discussed only the principles
of international law involved without
specifically taking up cases of in
vldual firms blacklisted.
The list officially described at the
department as "a protest" is said au­
thoritatively to be positive in tenor
and to leave no doubt regarding this
government's attitude. It is about
1,000 words in length. Present plans
are to make it public next Monday.
While official are reticent regarding
the details of the representations
made, it is understood that this gov*
ernment's view that illegal restric­
tions are imposed by the blacklist or­
der, upon the freedom of American
trade, is set forth in vigorous terms
and it is believed, is insisted upon.
ALLIED CRUISERS MAKE
HASTY OEPARTURE
Beaufort, Md., July 27.—Two Allied

The three men shown in the front
row were among the few workmen
who escaped from a tunnel 150 feet
beneath the surface of Lake Brie and
five miles out from Cleveland, O.,
where more than a score of workmen
were choked to death.
Cleveland, O., July 27.—Death in a
grave of water and heavy gas" is the
sacrifice of men who work to supply
a big city with water!
Heroes of peace they are—martyrs
for the public good!
This was never more plainly shown
than when more than a score of men
were choked to death 150 feet be­
low the surface of Lake Erie while
'building a tunnel to a crib that will
supply water for Cleveland.
In every case where lake cities se­
cure water from cribs far out in the
lake the same danger exists.
Men who work in the tunnels know
the danger. Many have died before
them.
In this latest accident the martyrs
were the men who died. The heroes
were the men who dashed into the
tunnel in an effort to rescue fellow
workmen, knowing they, too, might
be choked to death or 'buried under
a cave-in from the bottom of the lake.
On the surface of the lake is a crib
which looks like a lighthouse. Be­
neath it, reaching into the bottom of
the lake is the shaft.
From both ends, men are set to
work digging a horizontal tunnel to
meet eaqn other somewhere beneath
the lake. Air chambers are dug out
at dangerous places and pressure of
20 to 30 pounds per square inch sup­
plied to the chambers to keep the tun­
nel from caving in on the workmen.
The ground under the lake ia_ spot­
ted wjth gas pockets, which the dig­
gers mat •jBtrikig'at-any time. That
is one of the roads to death the work­
men'know they may take when they
enter the shaft each day.
There is no telephone or telegraph
communication between the crib and
the land or to the workmen.
The men working from the crib to­
ward land have no way of notifying
their comrades, who are working
from land to meet them, of any acci­
dent. In the latest accident workers
struck a gas pocket and more than a
score were overcome by poisonous
fumes in the two hours that elapsed
before men who were in tho crib
learned of the accident.

NEW YORK SWELTERS
IN THE BOILING SUN
New York, July 27.—A combination
of heat and excessive humidity envel­
oped New York today in the atmos­
phere of a Turkish bath. Only once
—in July, 1886—has the humidity
ibeen higher than that reached today,
88. The air even, when the sun was
shining fiercely, seemed to ooze mois­
ture. It took the starch out of linen,
the shape out of straw hats and the
energy out of everybody. The ther­
mometer and hydrometer moved up­
ward together, the former register­
ing 85. The humidity was the culmi­
nation of a fortnight of similar weath­
er that has caused New Yorkers more
than the usual discomfort that oc
companies the July heat.
Householders complained of mil­
dew and many have .built furnace
fires to dry their homes. The weath­
er forecaster .predicts that the hot
wave in the west will reach here to­
morrow and will be hotter than it
was today, tut the humidity ma:'" be
less.

Neither ferry would take any pas­
sengers over the Missouri river Wed­
nesday afternoon because of the
treacherous currents, according to R.
8. Lewis, member of the state board
of'control, who iwas on his way to vis­
it the state reform school at Mandan.
The man in charge of the cable
ferry informed him that they could
not operate because of the back cur­
rent on one side and the down cur­
rent on the other side that made pas­
sage unsafe.
Trouble in landing on a previous
trip caused the gasoline ferry owner
to advise not going off and to declare
that he could not take them back un­
less they returned in a half hour, be­
cause of the sandbar that was rapidly
forming on the further side.

That Amount Will Be Used for

SENATE FIRMLY
BEHIND THE ISSUE
$2,000,000 Voted To Be Used for
Relief of Dependent
Families.
Washington, July 27.—Nearly $700,
000,000 for national defense in the
fiscal year 1917 is the aggregate of
proposed appropriations reached in
the senate today with pasage of the
army appropriation bill, carrying in
round numbers $314,000,000.
This grand total for preparedness
still is subject to revision-, however,
(because the army bill will follow the
naval bill into conference, where re­
ductions are probable, despite the
firm attitude of 'President Wilson, in
supporting the liberal response of the
senate to the call for national defense.
The appropriations for prepared
ness as they now stand are as fol­
lows:
Army, $313,970,447.10.
Navy, $315,826,843.55.
Fortifications (land), $25,748,050.
Military academy, $2,238,328.57.
Army and navy efficiency, .$217,559,
348.05.
Total. $685,343,017.27.
As it passed the senate, the army
ibill exceeded the appropria.ions pass­
ed by the house by more than $138,
000,000. In the final hours of debate
on the measure, the senate agreed to
an appropriation of $2,000,000 for re­
lief of dependent families of national
guardsmen, and regular army soldiers
in service in the Mexican emergency.
Distribution of the fund is left to the
discretion of the secretary of war,
but in no case Bhall any dependent
family receive more than $50.00 per
nonthi' ....
Amendment Eliminated
An amendment agreed to yesterday
to give the coldiers on the border the
right to vote in the field at the No­
vember election was eliminated from
the bill on a point of order just be­
fore passage, in the main the senate
approved the military committee's
amendment over the house appropri­
ation in the army bill, although there
were a few reductions in the commit­
tee recommendations, due to improve­
ment in the Mexican situation.

trip through the east. While away
Kev. Moore visited in Philadelphia,
Chicago and Minneapolis and on his
return journey visited churches in

Missions and Church Extension, held
recently in Philadelphia, and was
elected vice-president of this organi­
zation.
While in session the board re-or­
ganized to conform to the legislation
of the last general conference and
created four departments of activity,
namely: A department for city work,
rural work, frontier work and evang*

An indication that the homeward

STBWGE CRAFT
Vessel Seen Near New York
Thought To Be a Sub
marine.
New York, July 27.—After persist­
ent reports had been circulated here
for two days that the German sub­
marine merchantmen Bremen had ar­
rived off Sandy Hook, some excite­
ment iwas caused tonight by the ap­
pearance in the lower ibay of a small
vessel of "low visibility."
The craft which, when first seen,
was lying so low in the water it was
barely discernible, was the (Norweg­
ian transteamer, Alderney, from Bom­
bay. The darkness, coupled with the
fact that the British steamship, Ad­
riatic, closely followed, caused many
persons along the shore, who thought
the Alderney a submarine, to rush to
telephones. Operators in the various
newspaper offices were kept busy for
some time answering inquiries from
all parts of the city.
It was not until the Alderney had
passed some distance into the harbor
that some persons, who had caught a
hazy outline of her, iwere convinced
that she was not a submarine.

tablished in first-class shape.
Although the thermometer regis­
ters 112 in the shade, the boys are
standing the heat well, few being in

There is no more excitement here
than there was at Camp Lincoln. The
Mexicans that we have come in con­
tact with are friendly, but many of
them are hungry.
We can see some of the Mexican
troops on the further side of the Rio

pear to be well armed and well drill­
ed.
One of the most attractive features
of the camp is a fine lake about one
mile from camp and it is needless to
say that the boys are making the
most of it.
The Third Texas troops are our
neighbors and were very kind to us
while we were becoming settled.
The rain yesterday was welcome
