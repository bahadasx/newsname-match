"The Square Peal Man

Several references Id my previous
articles to County Officials has been
misunderstood by a few people. Mj
investigation has been conducted only
along the line of our taraplke affairs
and our turnpike affairs are absolute
ly in the control of our County Jndre
and the 8 Magistrates from the varlons
Districts of Mason omit), and the
Koad Engineer appointed by the
County Judge and the Assistant Road
Engineer appointed by the chief En
gineer. All of these Officials give
bond or should do so for the faithful
performance of their duties. If our
Hoad Engineer and Assistant have
given bond for the faithful perform
ance of their duties, what should be
done when they have neglected their
duties so grossly and allowed the wat
er to run down the middle of our
turnpikes, washing the same away and
the Koad Engineer not making any
effort. In any direction, to eliminate
tills trouble or repair the road in
places where they became impassable,
last winter? Are the Bondsmen of
these officials responsible to Mason
county for their faithful performance
of duty?
The hundreds of rod of rock that
have been lying on the various roads
that remain unscattercd other than
being kicked Into the gutter by traf
flee, remain as mute testimony of the
inefficiency and negligence of the
Road Engineering Department
From information that I have gath
ered from members of the Fiscal
Court, there Is only a small percent
age of the pikes that members of the
Fiscal Court ever see, and, conse
quently, set year after year ana ex
pend money, not knowing for what it
has gone. The reports on record from
the Road Engineer, simply state the
amount of money that has been paid
out, each year, upon each road In the
county, and this statement is marked
"O. K.," "Committee." Do you think
that the Auditing Committee composed
of members of the Fiscal Court, know
what any part of the money has gone
for? Ih 1913, the turnpike fund fell
Short of expenditures about $5,000.00,
and in 1914, the road fund fell short
something over 4,000.00. Now It it
illegal for the Board of Magistrates to
expend more money than the fund
produces, and the money that is bor
rowed to make up this deficit, by law
cannot be charged to the 1916 road
fund. It is a misfortune for the
members since most of the shortage
was produced, but ignorance In the
eyes of the law does not excuse any
tiian.
I 'pon our Board of Magistrates, is
one member holding office in a certain
BIstrict, presumably, representing the
tax-payers lu that district, while in
fact, he has been living in the City of
Maysvllle for two years. From my
conception of the law, It Is perfectly
plain, that the office of Magistrate in
that particular District became va
cant when the member moved away.
Now, technically, this member may be
able to hold his seat, because ho goes
back and votes In his old home Pre
cinct, but really do you think the tax-
ayers of that vicinity are represented
in our Fiscal Court? I would say,
take a look at the turnpikes In Lewis
burg and Helena Precinct, and I will
leave you to bo the Judge aB to wheth
er the people are represented or not.
On July 26th, I took the Pleasant
Ridgo turnpike, two miles west of
Washington, following its course
4 7-10 miles to the Junction of the
Brundywiue pike. There is one large
bridge 60 feet In length and one small
one. The report of the County Engi
neer showed $78.40 Bpent on this roaa,
last year. The first 2-10 mile shows
there was some work done last year,
but for the other 4 6-10 miles, cer
tainly shows no results with the ex
ception of one hill about 200 feet In
length. Itock can be had In this rlc
inlty for, .at least, $2.50 per rod. There
should be $260 er year spent on this
road, and I am sure, Charles Crawford.
Ban Maher aud Ed Kennard and other
taxpayers on this pike would come
to Maysvllle oftener than they do, at
the present, If this was done. This pike
does not know what a ditch is, and, of
course, the water runs where our pres
ent turnpike management wants It to
run In the middle of the road.
From Murphysville, I look the Mur
pbysvllle aud Maysllck pike, which Is
3 t-l0 tulles long The first 1 7-10
mile, that is, from Murphysville to the
Sard is pike Is nothiug but bed rock,
water having washed away auything
that looks like napped rock This
road needs plenty of rock and plenty
of drainage.
From the Hardis pike to Maysllok.
ou this pike, there was considerable
rook givea the county lu 1M4, by Mr.
Touy i-ayfhaiu, Out rook be lag a mi
around a grave) aid whUik had fallen.
The wster supply was cut off In the
Sixth Ward yesterday for the greater
part of tho day owing to the fact that
the water company was making some
changes in the Are hydrants. No ser
ious Inconvenience was suffered how
ever, the people having been warn en m
plenty of time of the cutting off of the
supply.

and two neighbors offered to baul the
rock free of cbarge, but the Hoad En
gineer bad to give tbe Job of haulinK
to another man, who could not work
for nothing, and the two parties who
desired to do the hauling free of
charge, were told that they could haul
Tock from the Maysllck Quarry, if
they desirud to do something for the
county
I notice that during the last i-
days, there has been some rock hauled
especially in the low places, on this
pike, and those rock have been sledged
up aud left without being dirted or
broken fine, so that they would work
together. I have noticed this mode of
repair In so many places. It Is awful
ly nice to drive an automobile over a
road repaired In this way.
Oue farmer lu the neighborhood, liv
ing on this pike, told me, be hauled
rock two years ago to flx a bad place
in front of his bouse, and he requested
th? Koad Engineer to have aonie one
to break the rook aud spread them
A mau did break the rook with a
sledge hammer and oalled thu Job com
pleted, but this farmer says, that he
afterwards took his farm labor and
broke the rock fine In order that ve
hicles cuuld get by. He further states,
that the mau who sledged the rook,
was even paid for the rook that waa
hauled tree of charge Is It any won
der. there U Bb spUit of
between the farmers and the turnpike
management?
There are Beveral places between
the home of R. L Turner and MayB
llck, that are almost impassable, and
uo effort, whatever, is being made to
repair the damage that has been done
by a severe washout, that evidatly
visited this community sometime dur
ing the last is months. The Murphys
villo and Maysllck pike, is due for re
pair, at leaat $260.00, each year, and
tho repair of last year, showed the ex
penditure of $24.00. Do you think the
taxpayers on this turnpike should be
satislled and never grumble at pres
ent conditions? Uo you think the
Magistrate in that Preolnot, Is doing
his duty? Do you suppose that the
Magistrate ever consult their con
tituenta about the present couditloo
of affairs? It certainly looks to me
like that the entire Board of Magis
trates lu Mason county, have been vot
ing by proxy, tor several years, and 1
am going by results, and if you will
follow where 1 have beeu In golug
ove rthe roads lu Masou county, In the
last 40 days, you will be of the same
opinion that I am.
