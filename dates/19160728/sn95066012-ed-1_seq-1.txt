Washington, in charge of fish culture
for the I'nited States bureau of tlsh
erles, and by A. II. Dlnsmore. super
intendent of tlie government tisii pro

The chief reacon for the change is
the uncertainty of the present water

river. John Niles. local superinten
dent, will begin Monday to make ar
rangements for moving the building
to the new site. The structure will

BIG GAS WELL IN TUNNEL
Cleveland May Be Compelled to Aban

Cleveland, Ohio, July 27. The pos
sibility that the city may be compel
led to abandon not only search for
bodies of workmen still entombed! in
the water-works tunnel hero in Mon
day night's explosion hut ail further
work on the tunnel itself, loomed here
today as the result of investigation by
L. M. Jones of Pittsburg, government
mining expert. Jones believes a na
tural gas well of uncontrollable pro
portions has been uncovered under
the bed of the lake by the explosion.
If it Is possible rescue parties will
enter the tunnel today. The entombed
bodies are behind a cave-in nearly ;uii
feet long. Special machinery will be
needed to penetrate this wall of muck.
It will require several days to install
it if gas clears from the workings.
Water-works officials said today
they believed there were only nine
bodies in the tunnel, instad of eleven,
as previously stated. Two workmen
supposed to be entombed have turned
1 1 1 alive. Tills reduces the total loss
of lite to nineteen.

made to the health department today
by Pr. Edward J. Boi mingham. :n
thirty-five cases, the report says, the
symptoms completely subsided, while
the other fifteen infants are said to be
speedily recovering.
Special methods of caring for the
patients have bu n adopted in connec
tion with tho U3s of adrenalin, injec
tions of which are made directly into
tho spine ever? ix hours, Out. of the
methods Is supplying the patients,
when the convalescent period starts,
with new dolls and toys. A happy

measure, Pr. Cermingham said.

Village.
London, July 28. The British at
Posierea now have the advantage in
that they have secured n higher posi
tion and are able to attack the Ger
mans on a lower level where the
enemy is unprotected by concrete
defencec.
The British have driven all of the
Germans out of the Pelvllle wood, ac
cording to the report today of Gen.
Haig, the oominandor-in-ehief. Tho
British captured 168 prisoners in Del
Vllle wood, Gen Haig reported.
London, July 28. Since the com
pletion of the capture of Posierea tho
news from the British front in I'ranco
is mainly Of artillery actions and test
his; encounters at various points on
the German line. The comparative
lull and hot, hazy weather, it is as
sumed, has given the Germans an op
portunity to bring up further troops
and guns with a view to renewed at
tempts to recapture Poaieres where,
however, according to reports, the
British troops have further consoli
dated their positions.
Tonight's olliciul report shows that
there has been hard lighting all day
with some fluc tuations of fortune, but
that In extend the British Improved
their positions northeast of Pozieres
and In the vicinity of Longueval and
Delville wood.
To the scuth of the Sonime the
French have made further progress
against the Teutons to the east of
Estrces. In Champagne the Hermans
raided French first trenches near
Prosnes, but 0ey wen- driven out In
a counter-attack'.'- Bombardments are
in progress on various sections
around Verdun.
Petrograd, July 28. Russian troops
covered 100 miles in their advance on
Brxingan within a week. The capture
of that city means the virtual coniple
tlon ofthe Russian occupation of
Turkish Armenia. It gives Russia the
benefit of the extremely fertile valley
and opens an easy means ol communi
cation through Trehizond for the
western and southern Caucasian arm
ies:. It is estimated that the Turks had
between 25 and 3!i divisions between
j the Black sea and Mush -approxi-(
mutely 850,000 men. Three months
ago the Turks undertook u comprelien
i sivo campaign intended to recapture
' Brxerumj and incidentally to draw
troops from the Russian European
! theater. Bon Budenlch, the Russian
! commander in the Caucasus, succeed
ed. however, in holding the Turks In
the Brxerum district while delivering
; an effective blow at them in the
.dii-di district. In order to counter
this Hanking from the rouMi and a
i
1 similar effort from the north, the Rub
1 sians were obliged temporarily to
I abandon Mamakhatun, 50 miles west
of F.rzerum. The Russians now have
