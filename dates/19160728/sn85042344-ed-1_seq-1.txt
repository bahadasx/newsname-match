Captain Soared of the Brazilian
merchant ship Tlbagy, the only other
vessel besides the Neptune known to
hie been nour the liulsiana during
the early hours of Tuesday morning,
gave Collector Hamilton information
today which apparently eliminated all
possibility of her having been taken
for a cruiser The Tlbagy never sig
nalled any sh nor carried lights or
signals similar to those of a war
ship. While naval circlea within the capes
were agitated with the cruiser mys
tery today, the neutrality squad of
United State warships and the allied
petrol spent a quiet day oulsido. The
armored cruiser North Carolina and
four torpodo boats are now on guard.
The thre-f irneled British cruiser
which h-xs been on patrol for several
days, stemmed eastward out of sight
today and a f ciur-f unnelcd French
cruiser replaeid her.
Supplemental reports on the ap
Dearane of an English cruiser within
the capes on Monday night were being ,
prepared by naval officers here for :
transmission to the navy department.
Various details of the Incident have
gone forward to Washington at dif
ferent times since Tuesday, but the
department has expressed a desire for
more. One point, It is understood, ;
that It wishes cleared up is why the j
cruiser was not seen leaving the!

WAHITINGTON. July 21. Sir Cecil

Informed Acting Secretary I'olk today
that he received a message from the
admiral commanding the British
squadron on the Atlantic, denying that I
a British warship had entered Chesa
yeake bay as reported by 1 lie com- ,
mander of the battleship Ixillisinna.
The ambassador suid the British
ships had strict orders not to enter j
the three-mile limit of American ter- :
ritorial waters to waylay the German!
submarine Deutschland or for any
other pin pose and the admiral had
reported that their instructions had
not been violated at any time.
The statement of the ambassador
will be accepted by the state depart- j
nicnt, but the commander of the
IjOtiisiana Is being pressed by the navy ',
for further details on his report that
a craft which passed him at Lynn ,
Haven inlet signalled "English
cruiser."
Officials do not know what to make ,
of the case, but some are Inclined to 1
believe that the American officer was
the victim of some kind of hoax. The

How can we keep our machine running smoothly?
Call a special session of the legislature and pass some laws.
Will that not cost tho people a lot of money?
Yes, but fell with tho people; we're for ourselves.
What kind of a law will we have passed?
Oh, raise the old nigger iiuestion for a shield, and then stick
A.
In something that will give us control
register Just the ones we want to register.
Q. And how will we fix the ballot so to be sure of the law
being adopted?
A. The usual "yes" and "no" vote will never do. Just put on
it three words. "For the Amendment," and then all the people who
do not mark out those words will be counted as voting for it
Q. But how will we overcome the adverse vote that will be
recorded by honest Democrats and Republicans?
A. Put In a provision that to vote against the law the voter
must mark the words out "with a lead pencil." The average honest
citizen will forget to bring a lead pencil with him.
Q. What will we call this law?
A. Call it the "literacy test amendment" That sounds all
right, and will be Just as good as anything else.

FARM LOAN BOARD
TO ORGANIZE SOON
Division of Country fnto 12
Federal Bank Districts
First Step.
WILSON NAMES MEN
Hearings on Designation of
Districts Will Begin
Within 'J Months.
ASH1NGTON. July 27 Division
of the country Into 12 federal
land bank districts und location of
federal land banks In each of them
under the new rural credits law will
be undertaken soon by the federal
farm loan board, four of whose mem
bers were nominated today by Presi
dent Wilson. Secretary McAdoo, who
as an ex-officio member completes
the board, said tonight, however, that
he believed It would be Impossible to
conclude organization of the system
in less than six months and that it
might not be In actual operation be
fore next spring.
The four men nominated today as
members of the board are Charles K.
Jdidel of Kansas, George W. Norris
of Pennsylvania, W. S. A. Smith of
Iowa and Herbert Quick of West
Virginia. The president Is expected
to designate either Mr. Norris or Mr.
Quick, the Democratic members of
the board, to act as farm loan com
missioner and executive head of the
farm loan system.
No Ditto Can Ilo Set.
I'ntil the senate acts upon the nom
inations no date for a meeting can be
set, but It was believed probable to
night that the members would get to
gether within two weeks. Hearings
on the designation of districts and thei
location of banks probably will begin I
some time In September. The first of j
these is expected to be held here and
most of the state capitals probably
will be visited before they are con
cluded. Although In making his selections
the president named a lawyer, a
banker, a farmer and an economist, it
was polned out tonight that the board
would have little to go on In framing
Us decisions. The vast amount of in
formation collected by the reserve
hl,nk
organization committee two
years ago in aligning the federal re
serve districts will be virtually value
less to the new hoard. That commit
tee paid particular attention to the
flow of commerce and the channels
of trade and to information from
bankers and gave little heed to the
farmer.
About the only directory provision
in tne new law is that th- 12 federal
land bank district shall be appor
tioned with "due regards to the farm
loan needs of the country," und that
state lines shall not bo broken in de
fining districts.
Will Outsider Citlo.
It was said tonight however, that
the board In locating the banks would
consider first cities which are near
farming centers, regardless of size or
other banking facilities, and that
ell Ks which were candidate for fed
oral reserve banks, but failed to ge
them, probably would tie strongly
considered for federal land banks.
