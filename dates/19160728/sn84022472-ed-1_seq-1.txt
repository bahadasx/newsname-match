, Radical elimination of the projected
scope of Remington City, as that sec

has resulted In the reported offerings
of. huge quantities of brick, lumber

as well as buildings, either completed
or uncompleted may be purchased
and have already been offered to the
(housing committee . of the Chamber
of Commerce is tacitly admitted' by
officials of the Remington Arms &
Ammunition Co. today?'
It is ,not to be assumed that --all
building; operations of, the company
looking towards housing of employes
will toe stopped but it 'has been found
by those Investigating the economic
situation that plans for housing, as
'well as otlher departmetns of the bix
industry, were far beyond the actaal
needs of the company for many years.
Curtailment la the natural result. ' '
Local contractors who have been
asked to bid upon more than a million
brick and huge quantities of building
material were under- the impression
today that no more actual building
operations will be completed here, be

true, however, upon the positive asser

manager of the company, today,, who
said: . Tt is not so tnat we have shut

changed. '. We- are still building and
will continue to build."

206 houses f brick originally had been

The' submarine U-S3, according to
the official account of the trial, had
signalled to the British steamer to
show her flag and stop, but Captain
Fryatt did not heed the signal, ana,
it ; is alleged, turned at high speed
towards the submarine, which only
escaped by dtving immediately, aev
eral yards below the surface.
Captain Fryatt, the official state
ment says, admitted that he had fol
lowed the Instructions of the British
admiralty. Sentence was confirmed
and the captain was executed and shot
for a "franctireur .crime against

President ""Stanley took the stand

On cross-examination 7 by Judge
