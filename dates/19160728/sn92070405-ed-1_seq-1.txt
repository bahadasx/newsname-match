FIFTY THOUSAND ACRES OF LAND
IN ANIMAS VALLEY UNDER OPTION
THE McGEE COMPANY, OF AR DMORE, OKLAHOMA, TO PROS
PECT FOR OIL AND MINERALS THERE
Steins, N. M., July 26. Tho A.
T. McGec Company, Geologists and
mining experts from Ardmorc, Ok
lahoma, have taken an option on
fifty thousand acres of land in the
Animas valley, and are preparing
to prospect for oil. They will also
take option on a large tract of
claims which are said to be rich in
lead and zinc.
The company is composed of two
brothers, and they have both been
in the Animas valley for several
days looking over the country.
They have given out as their opin
ions that the valley contains largo
deposits of zinc, lead, copper and
salt, and that it is a gas and oil
country. Their willingness to take
an option with several thousand
dollars as a forfeit attests the real
value they set on their own opin
ions. If there is oil in the dis
trict, the country is in the way of
n w future. It is said that the
company has other big interests
back of them in the event of the
property turning out as tney De
lieve.

WM. E.BARNES
DIED IN FRIRC0
Complication of Diseases Causes
Death of one of the South
west's Best Known Men
FIFTEEN YEARS WITH S. P.
Los Angeles, Calif., July 26.
One of Lordsburg's and the south
west's most faithful servants and
advocates is dead. The writer has
just learned of the sad news which
carries with it the loss of a friend
true and loyal. William E. Barne (.
for many years traveling freight
and passenger agent of the South
ern 1'acific, died a week ago Sun
day at tho S. P. Hospital in San
Francisco.
His loss is a severe one to the
colossal industry he represented,
and to the people of the southwest,
viio knew him as a champion 01
their cause for progress and ad
vancement. Just a short time ago
he was a caller at the Western Lib
eral office seeking data to be in
corporated in railroad literature to
be published and circulated thru
out the United States. At all
times he worked for the interest of
every community in the southwest
making friends for his railroau
that can be numbered by the thous
ands.
William E. Barnes, traveling
freight and passenger agent of
the Southern Pacific Company,
Tucson division, died Sunday ev
ening of a complication of dis
eases at the S. P. general hospital
in San Francisco. The news was
a complete surprise to Mr. Barnes'
friends in Lordsburg, as it was on
ly about three weeks ago tha the
Liberal was in receipt of a very
cheerful letter from the popular
railroad man, and wo were en
couraged to bclievo that he was
improving.
The body arrived in Tucson on
Wednesday and the funeral was
held in that city yesterday.
Mr. Barnes was a very excep
tional man and was perfectly fit
ted for the work in which he was
engaged in latter years. The pre
vailing opinion that a diplomat is
a term peculiar to governmental
and international affairs has been
the cause of more misunderstand
ings and ruptures resulting in loss
of life and property than the aver
age man has any idea of. Mr,
Barnes was a railroad diplomat,
and his peculiar talent in meeting
all classes of men in all walks 01
life can never bo estimated in the
results obtained. His personality
was probably one of the greatest
assets possessed by the company,
although it could not be gauged
and reduced to the terms of a bal
anee sheet. His passing is great
ly regretted by the railroad men
and citizens of Lordsmug, who will
always remember him as a kind
and sympathetic friend and a
faithful and successful servant o
tho great corporation for which he
has labored for the past fifteen
years.

as "Paradise Farm," at JVlymlus
under the act of Congress of Ap
ril 14, 1820, 96 years ago, whid
was the first public land law enart
ed bv the United States. The
(rrantitiir of this deed from tru
government to Mr. Turner is the
first of its kind so far granted in
I hi v. rpirinn. so far as is known, and
establishes beyond question that
straight titles can lie given to rcai
developers. It proves, that the
Mvi-rnmnnt titles issued to homc-

STARTLING DEVELOPMENTS IN THE ,
MURDER OF WILL PARKER AND WIFE,
BELIEF GROWING THAT WOM
BAND DID TH
AN AND NOT MEXICAN IIUS-,
v. irnm. nrcmi
At the trial in tho Justice Court
before Justice of tho Peace C. W.
Marsalis developments started to
unfold which have since given rise
to much talk and more hard think
ing on tho part of interested mem
bers of the families left to mourn
the murder of Will Parker and his
young bride, Alice Krcbaum-Par-
ker. More interest has been arous
ed than at any time since the deed
was committed, and it is possible
that a solution will be arrived at
with much more case in the Sep
tember term of court than it has
ben supposed possible
It will bo recalled that Mrs. An
drea Valenzuela was arrested
three weeks ago as a suspect by
deputies of the Sheriff's office, and
sent to the county jail at Silver
City pending a hearing in Justice
Court. At the time, Mr. Krebauni,
father of the murdered girl, in
sisted that she was an important
character in tho affair, but the
idea was not given much favor
other than that she could tell
great deal, perhaps, of what hap
pened there. Tho idea was pre
valent at first that the deed was
comittcd by an outlaw band of
Villistas or otilen bandits mini
old Mexico who had crossed ovei
the Border on one of their usual
raids. But at the time of tho cap
ture of the woman, the belief wat
growing into a certainty that sucl
was not the case. Admissions oi
her part substantiated the theory
but even then, it was thought that
she was only an unwnilling accom
puce.
Mrs. Valenzuela was brought
from the county jail by auto his
Monday, and the hearing begüi
about one o'clock. Then is tin
time that people began to opci
their eyes. The woman proved t

not a trace of emotion, and from
time to time poured herself a glass
of water from the pitcher on tho
Justice's desk and without n tro-'
mor carried it to her lips. Long
before the hearing was concluded,)
it was evident to everyone in tho'
room that instead of an ignorant!
person to deal with, there was a
very bright one indeed. She prov-l
ed herself wily and equal to sud-'
den emergencies in the rain of
pointed questions hurled at her by
District Attorney Vaught. It is'
evident that she knows not only
some things, but all about the
crime, and whilo pretending ignor-
anee, she at the same time made
admissions which tiniplicatc her -far
more than was seen at the
time. i
Among other things developed
at the trial was that her hfaideni
name was Josephena Pacheco", and
she is a sister of the notorious Pa
checos who arc implicated in the
Villa raid on Columbus. They are
charged with being informers to
Villa and his officers, and it was
thru thqin and their like that tho
partial success of the raid was
made possible. The Pachecos are
noted all along the border as being
an evil and underhanded family.
Belief is growing here that she
herself and not the man was thu
