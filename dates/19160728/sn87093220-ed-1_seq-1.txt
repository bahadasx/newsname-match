THIRTIETH YEAR
ASSESSED VALUATIONS

The National Lumber & Manufacturing Company
Alleges the Assessor Arbitrarily Placed
Excessive Valuations on Property
CASE IS ON TRIAL IN SUPERIOR COURT
Expert Pollock Suggests A Plan Calculated to
Measure Values That lias Been Used
Successfully Elsewhere
Tax troubles, like the poor, seem'
to be always with us. This week the
case of the National Lumber & Manu
facturing Co. vs Grays Harbor County,
in Judge Abel's court, has attracted
much attention owing to the magni
tude of the sum involved. The com
pany asks for the reduction of the
assessed valuation of Its property!
for 1914 from $284,000 to $120,000 and
in support of its contention sbmitted
the valuations made on the property
for taxation purposes during the seven,
years preceding 1914, to show an ab
normal increase. These valuations
were: 1907, $89,000; 1908, $86,000;
.1909, $92,000; 1910, $115,000; 1911,
$116,000; 1912, $118,00; 1913, $140,000,
and 1914, $284,000.
That our system of property valua
tions for the purpose of taxation is
faulty is evidenced by the almost con
stant complaints of inequality and the
frequent litigation, as well as the very
general feeling that some persons or
some classes of property are being fa
vored, yet our solons have so far
been incapable, or unwilling to remedy
the admitted evil.
Both the Democratic and Repub
lican party state platform this year
favor revision of the state constitution,
and the next legislative session will
doubtless provide for a constitutional
convention to frame a new document,
and no part of the present law needs
revision more than that pertaining to
public revenues. Great advancement
has been made in the older states since
our constitution was adopted, In 1889,
along this line, most of which has
stood the test of practical working, and
from which we should be able to
frame a system that would place the
cost of government equitably upon all
classes of property.
Values Capable of Measurement
That the tax assessment inequalities
and inconsistencies may be largely
reduced if not entirely eliminated by
a systematic treatment of the subject,
Is the assertion of E. W. Pollock,
president of the General Appraisal
company, of Seattle, the concern that
valued the saw mills and other plants
for the county authorities.
Mr. Pollock is at the Washington
hotel and has been in attendance at
Montesano for several days as a wit
ness on values in the case of the
National Lumber & Mfg. Co. vs.
Grays Harbor County.
"An assessor who undertakes to put
correct values on all the property of
a county, is undertaking an impossi
ble task, unless he has assistance in
measures," said Mr. Pollock to a Her
COSMOPOLIS DRUG
STORE IS RAIDED
The Corner Pharmacy in Cosmopolis
was raided for the second time by
a squad of officers headed by Sheriff
Mathews Saturday afternoon, and
Manager W. L. Snell arrested. Ten
cases of bottled whiskey were seized

Snell is said to have acted upon the
advice of his attorney, Dan Pearsall,
and will contest both cases.
The sheriff and his men came to
Cosmopolis Saturday afternooiv. They
wero armed with warrants permitting
their search of both depot and the

aid man. "He may have the best
intentions and be so honest that he
will give his friends the same treat
ment as other property owners, but
he cannot turn out creditable work
without measures for value any more
than a grocer can sell accurately with
out scales or a mill could buy logs
safely without scaling them or sell
lumber by estimating its quantity.
"The measure for farm lands is soil
fertility plus accessibility advantages;
the measure for town property is pop
ulation plus traffic for business prop
erty and good neighborhood, view and
other elements for residence prop
erty. Tide lands, logged-off lands,
standing timber, houses, town lots and
all other well known kinds of prop
erty, may all be valued much more
accurately than at present by the
use of tables. There would be no criti
cism of the assessor if people knew
that their property was valued by
the same rule —if the one who are
under-assessed could be required to
pay exactly on the same basis as
others.
"All the soils of Grays Harbor coun
ty have been surveyed and analyzed;
all the timber has been cruised by ex
perts and yet values of both these
large elements of tax sources are not
accurately measured for assessment
purposes. Pedestrian traffic in cities
and towns is the largest single ele
ment affecting business property
values and no one even tries to fit
values by counting traffic.
"Rights of way for railroads are
classed Into main lines and branches
and the railroads pay taxes on these
two kinds of right of way. The most
equitable manner to assess them
would be to require them to pay by
the number of cars which ran over
the various lines.
The influence of a hard surface road
on the adjoining property is reftflily
acknowledged to be more than the in
fluence of a dirt or gravel road or an
interurban railway line. Each one of
these influences should be given a
specific price, instead of requiring or
allowing the assessor to use his judg
ment.
"Our company has collected a num
ber of rules and formulas, used in
other places, and I am satisfied we can
greatly improve the situation in this
county if we have opportunity to in
stall the proposed changes on the
forms of property mentioned.
"This proposition has nothing what
ever to do with taxes proper, but is
simply a movement towards more ac
curate assessments."
INDIANS PERFORM
AT MOCLIPS BEACH
The largest crowd in several years
visited Moclips last Sunday, and all
were handsomely entertained. In
dians from the Quiniault reservation
and Oakville gave exhibitions of rid

war dances. A game of "Bone Gam
ble" between the two tribes of In
dians lasted for irours, and the Indians
won the base ball match 10 to 0. Horse
and foot races on the beach were an
other attraction, in fact, the visitors
did not experience an idle moment
during the day.

USCCDLENCE TO
DAIRY COWS
State Agricultural Col
lege Recommends En
silage for Dairy Cows
Pullman, Washington, July 26.—
The dairy cow must have green for
age or other succulence at all times if
she is to hold up in her milk pro
duction. It is not uncommon for many
cows to drop in their milk flow during
hot, dry weather, but this can be
prevented by providing something to
take the place of pasture.
The silo Is the best means for fur
nishing this succulence. According to
Professor A. B. Nystrom, Dairy Hus
bandman of the Experiment Station
at Pullman, excellent silage can be
made from corn, wheat, oats, and bar
ley, or clover, peas and vetch, or,
in fact, any combination of these. By
putting these crops In the silo at
stages ranging from the milk stage
in the case of small cereals to the
dented stage in the case of corn, the
largest amount of nutrients can be
saved and the crop can be harvested
with the least amount of labor. In
other words, the silo saves both feed
and labor.
When no silo is available these
crops should be cut green and fed
to cows in racks or In the stable
mangers. Such a practice is called
soiling. This method is not as eco
nomical as the silo method but rath
er than have no succulence soiling
should by all means be practiced.
It should be remembered that the
cow producing a large amount of milk
muft have succulence, hay, and grain,
and the most important of these is
succulence.

PROGRESSIVES
LEAN TO WILSON
Convention Is Called to Meet
in Seattle Tomorrow
WILL WORK TOGETHER
Claim Majority Vote in the
State Is Progressive
TACOMA, July 27 —Representatives
from organized labor, the farmers'
grange, women's clubs, "yellow" so
cialists and progressives, met in Se
attle and issued a call for the mass
progressive convention which is to be
held Saturday morning, July 29, Fred
Chamberlain of Puyallup, told the
progressives who had gathered at the
Y. W. C. A., Tuesday, at noon. The
meeting was called by Chairman Wal
ter J. Thompson for the purpose of
finding out how many delegates In
tended going to the Seattle mass con
vention. An even dozen responded to
the call. Fifteen are expected to at
tend the Seattle gathering.
Mr. Chamberlain declared emphat
ically that the majority vote in this
state was strongly progressive and
could not be attracted by any political
organization which did not represent
progressive principles. "Wilson Is
the only president I have known who
has given us progressive legislation,"
he said, "and I believe that we should
do like the big fellows do, stand by
those who stand by us. I am for
Wilson."
In telling of the conference wliicli
was followed by a call for a mass con
vention, Mr. Chamberlain declared
that the progressive party in the
state of Washington today represents
an entirely different element than that
which was called progressive two
years ago. He declared that the pro
gressive party today had got rid of
the "bull moosers," who had flocked
back into the republican ranks, and
that the officeseekers and others who
had attempted to dictate the party
policies had gone back to the G. O.
P., leaving only those who were pro
gressives from principle.
That the yellow "socialists, farmer
granges, women's clubs and Federa
tion of Labor would amalgamate with
the progressive party under the name
progressive, Mr. Chamberlain declares
is assured. No other party offers
these organizations what they de
mand, he declared, and for this rea
son the progressives will maintain
and keep the party name alive.
The question of support to a na
tional progressive ticket will be dls
cused at the Seattle mass conven
tion. Among the progressives who
gathered around the lunch table at the
Y. \V. C. A., those who spoke either
came out openly in favor of Mr. Wil
son or intimated that they would sup
port him if no progressive national
ticket was placed in the field.
Mr. Thompson declared that "be
cause Mr. Hughes is an able man and
an able lawyer and judge, is no reas
on why the progressive party should
die." He declared that he did not
intend to force his personal views
upon the progressive party, and did
not believe in attempting to control
the individual vote of the progressives.

DISCUSS SKATING RMS
AND MERRY-GO-ROUND
The City Council, After Warm Debate, Decides
to Close These Amusements at 10 P. M.
and All Day Sunday
THE CITY SEEKS ROAD TO CHARLEY CREEK
Several Street Matters Decided Upon. Go Slow
With Second Avenue fill. Build
Street to Cosmopolis
Five opponents of a resolution re
quiring that skating rinks and merry
go-rounds be closed all day Sundays
and after 10 p. m. on week days led
a filibustering demonstration at the
council meeting Wednesday night
which it took five votes to break.
The ordinance finally was passed but
not until Councilman J. M. Bowes
had declared it was unfair to these
two lines of amusement, inasmuch as
other amusement houses were allow
ed to run day and night.
Two amendments were tacked to
the ordinance when it first came up.
When these were lost Bowes and
Egerer wanted the ordinance referred
and when this lost they asked that it
be laid on the table. The fifth vote
was on the ordinance and this brought
"noes" from Bowes, Empey, McMas
ters and McWhinney. Egerer switch
ed and voted for the ordinance on
the last ballot because he saw the
ordinance would pass whether he
voted for it or not.
Street improvements were liberal
ly discussed again, the prin
cipal one of which was the ordering
of preliminary steps to see if state
and county help cannot be secured
to construct a 3f-foot gravel road
from Curtis street, South Aberdeen,
to the Charley creek road. The es
timated cost of this road is $25,930.
Engineer Kelsey thought the matter
should be referred to a committee,
to take It up with the state and the
county authorities, as well as private
owners, regarding the right of way,
and to see what aid could be had from
the state and county.
Councilman Bowes said the county
commissioners had brought the matter
of this road up to him, suggesting
action by the council, and saying that
TWO BANKS ARE
CONSOLIDATED
Hayes & Hayes and the
United States Trust
Company Merge
The United States Trust company
will be consolidated with the Hayes
& Hayes bank tomorrow, and its office
moved to the Hayes & Hayes build
iug, Heron and G streets. The latter
institution has been in control of the
former for sever years, a fact that
was of general knowledge, and the
consolidation of the two concerns Is
for obvious business reasons.
"We have owned the United States
Trust company for five years," said
Mr. Patterson in announcing the con
solidation, "and our ownership has
been a matter of public knowledge.
There was good reason for a time
to maintain the two / institutions
separately, but such reason has now
disappeared, and we have decided
that the best policy would be the con
solidation of two banks and their
housing under on roof. -A number
of factors have entered into this de
cision, the chief of which is that the
consolidation will provide the best
banking facilities possible and will
remove any impression that there is
a desire on the part of any group of
men to control the banking situa
tion here. If a third bank is deemed
advisable, the way is cleared. We
hope to greet all the friends and cus
tomers of the Trust Company at the
consolidated bank and to merit their
continued approval and patronage."
