FATAL ACCIDENT AT 10YALT0N
~WM. CONNER DIES FROM INJUR
IES SUSTAINED BY BEING
HIT BY TRAIN
William R. Conner, aged 21 years,
son of Mr. anil Mrs. S. E. Conner of
IJoyalton, died at St. Gabriel's hospi
tal here Wednesday at 1:45 p. m., fol
lowing injuries sustained at Royalton
early that morning, presumably by
being bit by a Northern Pacific train.
Conner was found lying between the
walk and the railroad tracks just in
front of the depot at Royalton, a short
time before train No. 7 arrived there,
about 1:45 a. m. It is believed that
he was hit by passenger train No. 3,
which passes through Koyalton a short
time before train No. 7. The condi
tion of the ground along the track
where he was found indicated that he
had been dragged aoout two rods. The
night operator at the station and oth
ers said that he was in the station
Tuesday night and that he was seen
leaving the station about an hour be
fore he was found near the tracks.
How he was hit is not known.
The young man man was rushed to
?t. Gabriel's hospital here imme
diately after being found and a phy
sician was called. He did everything
in his power to save the young man's
life, but it was unavailing and at
about 1:45 p. m. in the afternoon he
passed away.
An examination disclosed a com
pound fracture of the skull on the
right side, a compound fracture of
the right elbow, the chest was crushed
in and ribs were torn loose and both
ankles were badly bruised. He also
sustained numerous other bruises and
cuts. The attending physician stated
that the injuries to the head and chest
were sufficient to kill him.
Conner was one of the popular young
men of Royalton and he has played
ball with the Royalton team for sev
eral years, lately being their pitcher.
He was employed as clerk in a restau
rant in the village.
The remains were taken to Royal
ton Wednesday evening for inter
ment.

Commission Selects Central Route
—Little Falls Was Visited by
Tourists Tuesday
36 MILES OF ROUTE GOES THRU COUNTY
Little Falls is on the Jefferson High
way, »n the originally "laid out route,
known as the central route. The deci
sion was made by the Jefferson High
way commission at a meeting at St.
Paul Monday morning and it was of
ficially given out at 10 o'clock that
morning. The choice is directly con
trary to the last recommendation of
the state highwav commission, which
urged the selection of the eastern and
western routes, but according to its
first recommendation.
The relay sociability tour which
started from St. Joseph, Mo., to Winni
peg on the 20th, arrived in St. Paul
Sunday, starting over the route again
Monday afternoon. Tuesday afternoon
at about 2 o'clock they arrived in St.
Cloud and a few minutes before 6 the
same afternoon they arrived here, R.
L. Palmer of this city driving a Little
Falls car which was one of the official
ears on the trip. He joined the party
at St. Paul.
The Jefferson Highway Will Be of Great Value to Little
Falls and the County of Morrison, Bringing
Tourists from Everywhere
The members of the highway com
mission making the relay sociability
tour accompanied by orer 60 cars from
Royalton arrived here amidst the
cheering of hundreds of people and the
blowing of the mill whistles and ring
ing of bells. They were promptly es
corted to the Pine Grove park, where
they wrere the guests of the Elks, who
had a picnic there.
G. E. Hanscom, C. D. Schwrab, P. J.
Seberger, J. J. Quigley, P. R. Thielman
and Alvah Eastman made the run with
the party from St. Cloud to this city.
A. H. Turrittin represented Sauk Rap
ids from St. Paul and he introduced
the speakers.as far as *his city.
After the people had finished eating,
Mr. Millard introduced Mr. Clarkson,
general manager of the Jefferson High
way, who gave a brief talk. He said
that it was a great inspiration to see
the great interest taken by the people
all along the route of the highway and
the good feeling that is prevalent. The
highway, he said, will not only be a
connecting link between the north
and the south but it will serve to build
up community ideas everywhere along
its course that will be of immeasurable
value to us all.
Mr. Clarkson next introduced Walter
Parker of New Orleans^ general secre
tary of the Jefferson Highway associa
tion, who gave a short talk telling
principally about his home town, New
Orleans, and wrhat it will mean to the
highway as its southern terminal and
its future importance as a port for
the marketing of produce from the
Mississippi valley. Among the inter
eing things which he mentioned were
what has been done at New Orleans to
encourage marketing of produce
through that port, namely to construct
large grain elevators which are the
last word in elevator construction and
owned by the state, which will help to
reduce the cost of marketing, ana to
solve the question of finance in such
a way that the marketing of the crops
can be financed from the time they are
grown by the farmer until they are de
livered at the foreign ports, at the low
rate of interest of four per cent.
The next speaker was S. Wolsten
eroft of Des Moines, la., who is solicit
ing subscriptions to the Declaration.
He gave a brief talk on highway mat
ters and said that he had noticed that
the highway has created a much great
er community spirit and neighborliness.
Paul Nesbitt of McAllister, Oklaho
ma, .president of the Oklahoma Jeffer
son Highway association, was the last
speaker. The greatest accomplishment
of the highway, he believed, will be to
bring together the people of the north
and the south. There can be built up
in the Mississippi valley the greatest
institutions of every kind in the world
and the highway will be a great help
in this direction. The Jefferson high
way, Mr. Nesbitt said, is one of the
most important things in this country
in the past twenty-five years. Mr.
Nesbitt's ^alk was cut short by the ap
proach of a rain storm, which sent all
the people' home.
Wednesday morning at 8 o'clock, al
though raining, about 100 automobiles
loaded with highway boosters from this
city assembled downtown and escorted
the highway commission as far as Ran
dall. Several local men accompanied
the party further on, antf Mr. Millard
will go through to Winnipeg.
An evidence of the great interest
taken by most people in towns through
which the highway masses is at Sta
ples. The highway commission was
delayed near Lincoln for about five
minutes owing to a bad hill
but the delay was made up be
tween there and Staples and the party
reached Staples on schedule time.
When Manager Clarkson told the Sta
ples business men about the trouble
that was experienced at thehill, they
promptly got busy and within twenty
minutes they had raised1 the neat sum
of $2,000 to fix it.
Much credit for the routing of the
highway through Little Falls is due
J. K. Martin, president of the Little
Falls Automobile cWb and treasurer of
the state automobile association, and
R. B. Millard, secretary of the Central
Minnesota Jefferson Highway associa
tion and secretary of the Little Falls
Automobile club. They spent a great
deal of time and money in gathering
data in regard to the route and pre
senting it to the officials. County En
gineer Fenn is also to be commended in
forwarding the road work on the pro
posed route. In the first place the Lit
tle Falls Automobile club was respon
sible for it, as that organization took
up the matter of getting the highway
through here early last winter and
made an appropriation of $100 for that
purpose.
The Jefferson Highway will be of
much value to Little Falls as thousands
of tourists wrill pass through the city
every summer. To this county it will
also mean a great deal as the highwray
^traverses thirty-six miles of road in
'this county leading through some of
the finest agricultural lands in the
county and in fact, in the state. Little
Falls will no doubt be made a stopping
place by the tourists as the hotel and
garage accommodations are the best to
be had, the size of the city being taken
into consideration.
As finally chosen by the Jefferson
Highway association the route through
this state from Minneapolis to the
northern boundary is as follows:
Through Elkv River, St. Cloud, Sauk
Rapids, Little Falls, Staples, Wadena,
Itasca Park, Bemidji, Bagley, Red Lake
Falls, Thief River Falls, thence north
to Winnipeg. Through Morrison county
the route first passes through Royalton,
thence on to Little Falls, coming up on
First street south, thence on Broadway
to Second street west, thence north to
the state road and then on to Darling,
Randall, Cushing and Lincoln. The
road over the highway tnrougli this
county is in first class shape all the
way except a short distance at Lin
coln and this is rapidly being put into
first class condition.
Among the interesting things along
the route in* this county are the river
scefies, the forest of virgin pine with
in the city limits of Little Falls, the
only one of its kind in the state so
located, the beautiful lakes near Lin
coin, the lumber industry in Little
Falls, and all along the way splendid
agricultural and woodland scenes.
All along the route of the highway
Mr. Clarkson has been placing signs.
These signs, made of white enamel
steel, have the name Jefferson High
way printed on them and at each end
of the sign is a green tree, one a palm
and the other a pi#e. The Jefferson
Highway is called tfie highway "from
pine to paint."
In order to retain the Jefferson high
way the, counties and towns along the
route must meet certain requirements
and the association must also raise a
sum of money by popular subscription
and memberships within the next two
years. County Auditor MoNairy, the
morning the central route was select
ed, wired the Jefferson Highway com
mission that the county commissioners
of Morrison county had agreed to meet
all requirements and to do all in their
power for the highway.
Conditions to Be Fulfilled
Following are the conditions which
must be fulfilled by the counties along
the route:
1. Each county organize committee
of at least seven members within 60
days to co-operate with the Jefferson
Highway commission and work under
their direction.
2 There must be raised by each
county an amount equal to $9 per mile,
one-half of which must be paid to the
commission within 30 days and the
balance in 60 days.
3 The counties must support the
Declaration which is the official organ
and publication.
4 Counties must build 365-day road
and maintain it.
5 A fund of not less than $80,000
must be raised for the whole system
within two years by popular subscrip
tion and the memberships will be from
$5.00 to $1,000.
Towns along the way stand or fall
as a unit should one fail to meet its
obligations, notice was served at the
meeting of directors and members of
the official party making the St. Jo
seph to Winnipeg tour, that a different
route will be selected.
In that event one-half of the mile
age assessment will be refunded if the
way is changed within two years.
E. H. Hennen, who with his family
and that of M. Smraeker's of Melrose
has been on a ten-day autoinobile trip

SOWS EXPECT TO RETUM
{GUARDSMEN AT FRONT BELIEVE
STAY WILL BE SHORT ONE,
LOCAL BOY WRITES
Among the National Guardsmen on
the border the general opinion seems
to be that they will not be stationed
there very long. This is what Edward
Gierok, who was one of the last to en
list from here, says in a letter to his
father, W. J. Gierok.
Following are excerpts from his let
ter:
Everybody around here likes it
and wrould do it all over again. The
band is.playing now, so everybody's
dancing. It plays every morning and
night. We drill in the morning before
mess for 15 minutes and from 7:30 to
10:30 and then from 4 to 2:10. Ifc is
n't so bad, because they let us rest a
lot on account of the heat. The-first
two days were scorchers because wo
had at lot of work to do cleaning up
and getting tents up. When we first
struck here the ground was covered
with trees, brush and mostly this tall
cactus. We've got that all cleaned
up now. The street is as clean as a
cement sidewalk.
"I don't think we will stay down
here very long the way the officers
talk, so I guess we will be home before
long. We are the nearest to the bor
der and that's only five miles away.
'There isn't anything doing around
here though.
"The water,we drink is ^out luke
warm and once in a while we get ice.
We've had a lot of lemonade since
we've been here and we get all we
want to eat, so we're satisfied. The
nearest town to us is three miles and
that is Mercedes. We may go there
pretty soon and camp there."
ELKS HELD ANNUAL PICNIC
In spite of the bad weather that pre
vailed all day the Elks picnic at the
Pine Grove park Tuesday was quite
successful, several hundred people at
tending. The weather was the same
at the picnic last year, it being broken
up in the evening by rain.
During the afternoon a few athletic
events were pulled off and at 6 o'clock
all partook of a big supper, called a
bean bake, from which the Elks annual
picnic derives its name. In the eve
ning official of the Jefferson highway
association gave short talks, mention
of which is given in connection with
the highway article in another column.
When a raistorm came up the bowery
dance was called off and the Elks and
families repaired to the Elks hall,
