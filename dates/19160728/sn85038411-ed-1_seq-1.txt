President Frank B. Musser of the
Harrisburg Railways Company will
again meet the City Commissioners
this afternoon at Council's request to
further discuss the trolley strike aitu- |
ation.
Council officially heard the trolley
men's side of the strike this morning-
Late yesterday afternoon President
Musser met the Commissioners and
gave the company's viewpoint of the
controversy.
The net result of these two confer
ences was a request that Mr. Musser
again meet Council to see if some
plan of arbitration cannot be agreed
upon. Mr. Musser consented to meet
the Councilmen and a meeting has
been arranged for 4 o'clock this after
noon
Mayor E. S Meals presided at this
morning's meeting of the commission
ers which was held behind closed
doors. Commissioners E. Z. Gross. W.
H. Lynch and H. F. Bowman attended
as the city's representatives while the
strikers were represented by a com
mittee headed by Hugh L.McLaughlin.
chairman of the trolleymen's union
grievance committee.
"Various points under discussion
were given us yesterday afternoon by
a committee from the union," said
Commissioner Lynch to-day in discus
sing this morning's conference, "but
our meeting with Mr. McLaughlin and
his committee was the flrst opportun
ity we've had to officially hear the
strikers' story.
Will "Confer With Musser
"What we will endeavor to do is to
confer with President Musser in the
hope of getting his consent to arbitra
tion. That's what the striking men
want. Of course they desire to be rec
ognized as a body to the extent that
they Aiay be given a chance to submit
an arbitration agreement. We will
make a strenuous effort to confer with
Mr. Musser on this point this after
noon and inform him of the results
of to-day's conference.
"The strikers' committee was very
reasonable. The strikers, according to
Mr. McLaughlin, will be willing to
mingle with the other men on the
cars and help to operate them pend
ing the settlement of the difficulties by
arbitration.
"What we as city councilmen want
to do is to get the two parties together.
We're going to make every effort to do
so."
"Wa» Mr. Thorpe preesnt at to-day's
conference?" Mr. Lynch was asked.
"No. I don't know that he was ex
pected to be. As I understood it the
meeting was to be with the committee
from the strikers."
"What transpired at yesterday's con
ference with Mr. Musser?"
Musser's Position
"Well, I think t"he gist of that is
contained in to-day's papers. The
president seemed to think there is
nothing to arbitrate,'' said Mr. Lynch.
"He dwelt particularly on the method
of striking. The men quit," he pointed
out, "without warning; that they had
voted on the question and went out as
soon as the vote had been taken."
"Did the commissioners to-day pre
sent this viewpoint to Mr. McLaugh
lin's committee?" he was asked.
"Oh, yes. But he has his side of
the story, too. The men, he explained
had been endeavoring fruitlessly to get
interview with the head of the com
pany for several days prior to the tak
ing of the vote."
"Did Mr. McLaughlin's committee
make any request as tcwhether or not
the striking men be taken back?"

HARRISBURG GAVE
STARVING BELGIANS;
ITS OWN CHILDREN
To the Editor of the Harrisburg Tdigraph;
I am appealing to the people of Harrisburg, through your paper,
to see if it is not possible to get more money to help the families that
have been left here by the men who have gone to the front. Upon
investigation this morning, 1 found three families very much in need
of help; one, a mother, about sixty years of age, who makes on an
average of fifty cents a day by taking piece work home. Her son,
nineteen years of age, was the breadwinner of the family, and has gone
to the front with Company D. She has two other children to support
on this small amount. Another case of two young women who have
tried to make expenses less by giving up their little homes and renting
txvo upstairs rooms. They have had no money of any description since
the breadwinners of the family left on June 22nd. There teas a small
savings account and that is what they are living on, together with a
small amount derived from washing, which they are taking in to do—
women who were never called upon before to do work like this, but are
trying to be as brave as possible, with four little children. One of the
women told me she would gladly go out to work, but she has a child nine
months old whom she is nursing, and, of course, this would make it
impossible for her to do that.
These are only a couple of instances of a great many that are turn
ing up each day. Many people have said to me "Why did these men
go to the front and leave their families depending upsn charity f" and I
am enclosing you a copy of a telegram received from Major-General
Wood which wag sent to the different commands, and which will explain
to you, if you read it carefully, why the men are not returning to their
families at once. These men have put country before their families, and
I think the people of Harrisburg should be patriotic enough to relieve
them a little bit, and I cannot understand the lack of interest.
I have been advised by the Adjutant General's Department that
the reason why the state of Pennsylvania has not paid the men for their
time in camp is because it is the duty of the Federal Government to
do so.
I wish you, through your paper, would make another appeal for
help. lam sure it will reach the people of Harrisburg, because there is
great evidence of the need of money.

Chairman, Pennsylvania Women's
Division, National Preparedness.

CLARK ACT
AND CONDEMNE
EDITORS OF STATE
Changes in Third Class City Commission Form of Govern
ment Law by Next Session of Legislature Are Indicated
by Experiences of Many Cities; Failure in Some Towns;
Success in Others, but Many Weak Points Have Been De
veloped; Politics Despite N onpartisan Provisions
IS the commission form of govern-!
ment a success or failure?
Many of the prominent editors of
Pennsylvania have given their views to |
the Telegraph on this subject and the
great diversity of opinion represents
public sentiment on the question.
The Telegraph this evening presents
these views for the benefit of all who
are making a study of the problem
in cities of the third class. This im
portant change in the government of
so many of the cities of Pennsylvania j
has now been In force long enough to <
afford an opportunity for study o£ the j
new scheme of administration. It is |
believed the symposium here presented i
will be of particular interest to all the |
cities now under the commission ar- ;
rangement.
It is almost certain that some
changes in the Clark act will be made
at the next session of the Legislature
and it is entirely probable that some
of these matters will be considered at
the convention of the representatives
of Third Class cities at Johnstown next
month.
Many weaknesses of the commission
plan have developed, and whether the
scheme is abolished entirely or simply
amended to overcome its defects will

depend entirely upon the co-operation
of the several cities concerned at the
next session of the Legislature.
Perhaps the most serious objection
to the law is its log-rolling feature and
the effort of each commissioner to get
for his own department something at
the expense of the city-at-large. So
far as the nonpartisan feature of the
new scheme is concerned it has not
proved a great success. It seems to
be a three-to-two game everywhere.
Denver discarded the commission
form of government a few months ago
and in place of five commissioners,
vested with both executive and legis
lative powers, elected a mayor as the
directing head ot its municipal affairs,
and a separate legislative branch!
which is also elected. Under the new
Denver plan some features of the com
mission form are retained, but Robert
W. Speer, the mayor who has done so
much for Denver, is the directing and
efficient, head of the administration.
Perhaps one of the most emphatic ob
jections to the Clark act is that the
mayor has lost his proper place in the
management of citv affairs.
Under the commission government
in Denver the perpetuation of evils
which It was opected to abolish was
a distinct disappointment. There was
an absolute failure to eliminate the
political machine so-called. Now the
mayor is directly responsible and the

PLACES FOUND ON
BORDER FOR MEN
NOW AT GRETNA
Guardsmen of 9th and 13th
Regiments, Third Brigade,
May See Service
GO TO HOMES TOMORROW
Stewart Outlines Plans For
Equipping Ninth as
Artillery
By Special Correspondence
Mt. Gretna, Pa., July 28.—A place
in the seventh division of the National
GuarC of the United States made up
of Pennsylvania trooDS has at last
been found for the men in Camp
Armstrong and it is probable that
guardsmen of the Ninth and Thir
teenth regiments of the Third brigade
will be on border patrol among their
comrades of the other Pennsylvania
regiments.
The Ninth regiment of Wilkes-Barre
will be turned Into the second Penn
sylvania field artillery and its num
bers Increased at least by 400. The
13th regiment of Scranton will be
known as the third artillery ajid it
will also recruit. Both will go to
their homes to-morrow. Adjutant
General Stewart said that both would
return to Mt. Gretna shortly.
To Absorb Battalion
Thj separate battalion will also be
absorbed. Companies K from Sunbury
and F from Danville being united into
one company and taking the place of
a company at El Paso that will join
the engineering company of the
Fourth infantry. Companies D and C
of the separate battalion will return
In a week to be physically examined
and mustered into government service.
They will then aid in training the
rookies as they come into the summer
camp.
According to General Stewart, the
Ninth regiment or the Second artil
lery. as it will be known, will consist
of six batteries of 126 men each and
will be divided into two battalions.
They will use three-inch field guns.
The 13th or the Third artillery will
have six batteries or three battalions
composed of two batteries each. It
will be armed with four and seven
tenth-inch howitzers.
"We may not be able to get the full
war strength, although we will try for
that. But we have to get full peace
strength before we go on duty," said
General Stewart.
Touching on the subject of prob
able demotions, General Stewart said:
"I can tell very little about that.
It may be probable that some officers
will not pass the physical examination.
You can see for yourself though that
ae an Infantry regiment has twelve
captains and an artillery only six,
something along the line of elimina
tion must happen."
"ICE TEA" FOR PRISONERS
LEADS TO ARREST
Carlisle, Pa., July 28. Bringing
liquor in the guise of "Ice tea" to the
Cumberland county jail proved costly
to Lloyd Turner of this place. He was
arrested and held for court on the
charge. Turner had friends in jail
and during the recent hot days
brought them consignments of the
"tea" daily. Officials became sus
picious and began an investigation
which resulted in his arrest.
SIZZLERS AHEAD;
RELIEF IS BRIEF
Bunches of Heat Just Waiting
Their Chance to Creep Into
Central Penna.
Due to a cool wave which moved
northward from the coast of Virginia
last night and was still moving to-day,
Harrisburg received temporary relief
from the hot wave from the west.
But on the outskirts of this cool
atmosphere bunches of heat are wait
ing to move in. It will be warmer to
morrow and according to local weather
forecasts Sunday is likely to be a
scorcher.
The cool wave from the South re
duced the humidity and brought a
drop of from two to four degrees In
the temperature. Yesterday was the
hottest day of the summer. The high
est tempsrature was 93.4.
An Associated Press dispatch from
Chicago to-day says:
"Illinois and neighboring States
found no relief to-day from the un
usual heat wave and there was a prob
ability that the records of 100 de
grees yesterday might even be hroken.
"In Chicago the downtown street
thermometers at 2 o'clock this morn

BREMEN CAPTURED
IN HALIFAX, SAYS
NEW YORK REPORT
Overdue U-Boat Said to Have
Been Nabbed by British
Patrolling Squadron
SISTEB TO DEUTSCHLAND
High Official Writes That Sub
marine "Is Being Well
Cared For"
Halifax, July 28. Nothing is
known here of the Bremen story
further than the report from New
York.
New York, July 28. —Another cir
cumstantial report regarding the
whereabouts of the German merchant
submarine Bremen, long expected at
some American uort, Is that the ship
has been captured by British patrolling
squadrons and is to-day tied up in the
northwest arm in the harbor of Hali
fax. N. S.
The report of the capture, which is
published here to-day. is given in a
letter said to have been written by the
secretary of a high Canadian official
to a business man of this city. The
letter is declared to have been mailed
from Buffalo, N. Y., two days ago, and
therefore could not have been sub
jected to the scrutiny of the Canadian
censor.
The letter was written in confidence,
it is stated, but the information it
contained was divulged by the re
cipient to a friend in the course of
an argument as to whether or not the
Bremen could pass through the British
barrier.
The letter says:
"You seem In New York to be wor
ried about the Bremen. There is
really no cause for worry, for at the
present time she is tied up In what we
call the northwest arm in the harbor
of Halifax and is being well taken
care of."
Telegrams of inquiry sent to Ottawa
and Halifax ha- e not as yet brought
any confirmation of the reported cap
ture of the merchant submarine.
The Bremen, the second unit of Ger
many's jropose.l merchant submarine
fleet, has been due for some days in an i
American port. Private information
was to the effect that she had been
ordered to mako New York, harbor if
possible, but in the event that this was
not feasible she was to go to any other
American port that presented a favor
able opportunity for entrance. Impor
tant mail for bankers here and prob
ably for the merchant submarine
Deutschland was said to be aboard.
The long delay of the submarine
Deutschland. now at Baltimore, in
leaving for home is said in some quar
ters to have bern due to the fact that
she was waiting for further instruc
tions contained in the Bremen's mail
budget.
PORTLAND HEARS IT, TOO
Portland, Maine, July 28. —A tele
gram saying the Germaji underwater
merchantman Bremen had been cap
tured and was being to*ed into Hali
fax was received in this city to-day
from a Canadian source which was be
lieved to be. reliable.
DENIED BY AUTHORITIES
Ottawa, July 28.—The naval de
partment denied to-day that there is
any foundation for the* story published
in New York that the German sub
marine Bremen has been captured and
taken into Halifax.
