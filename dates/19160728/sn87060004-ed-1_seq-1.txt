LIGHTNING
CAUSES STOCK
BARN FIRE
Seven Mules, Hay and Other
Property of St. Bernard
Burned at Mortons
MANY PERSONS
SEVERELY SHOCKED
IN NEIGHBORHOOD
An electric storm which occured
just before five o'clock Tuesday af
ternoon furnished a vigorous stroke
of lightning which fired one of the
stock barns at Mortons Gap belong
ing to the St. Bernard Mining Co.
and destroyed property valued at
about $2,900, partially covered by
insurance. Six mules were burned
in the building and one large mule
that was gotten out h so severely
burned that it had to be killed. Loss
included a large quantity of baled
hay just recently stored in the build
ing together with harness and sup
plies.
A number of persons, some of
them quite a distance from the build
ing, were shocked. Need Morton, a
carpenter who was at work at a build
ing a hundred yards distance, was
knocked down and stunned. Two
negro children as far away in another
direction were also knocked down.
Marion Lovan and Warren Rash who
were walking on the road toward the
mine were both partially stunned
Rash returned to the building at once
and got solne of the mules out. Lo
van felt the shock in his head and
' the repor! was so sharp that he took
off his hat and felt his head to see if
he had been shot. Lovan seems to
have a way of sticking his head
around where the lightning is going
to strike. Once before while pas ing
the Baptist Church in Mortons Gap
lightning struck the church building
and knocked shingles olT on his head.
His friends figure that after these two
escapes Lovan doesn't need a light
ning rod. Henry Harris who lives a
hundred yards away from the build
ing thought somebody had fired a big
gun near his house. Wyley Edwards
who was in the weigh-oflice at the
tipple some three hundred yards
away, felt the shock and was thiown
back two or three steps as he walked
toward the door. Eye witnesses say
that the whole roof of the barn build
ing was immediately enveloped in
flames from the lightning stroke.
hvery effort was made to save the
mules but the entire loft was stored
with hay and the building was a
seething furnace in a few minutes.
Thirty-live mules were kept in the
two barns and lot at that place, seven
of which were lost in the fire. The
building will be rebuilt at once and
mules have already been bought to
replace those lost.
Joe Campbell, Superintendent of
forestry for the St. Bernard Com
pany, driving homeward with a
friend came near driving into this
barn for refuge from the storm, but
fortunately drove on to a livery sta
ble at Mortons Gap and thus escaped
' disaster.

FOWLER RE
PLIES TO HEN
DERSON GLEANER
Shows he Has Complied With
Federal Law as to
Expense Account
INTEREST irl REPUBLICAN
CONGRESSIONAL CAMPAIGN
Uopkinsville, Ky., July 2C In
terest has been aroused in the Repub
lican Congressional campaign during
the last few days, in portions of the
second district reached by papers pub
lished at Henderson and Owensboro,
alleging that Hon. Wm. T. Fowler
of Christian County had failed to
comply with the law as to the filing
of expense account within the proper
time before date of primary. These
tto newspapers ot Daviess and Hrr-
d:rson Counties refer to the Ken
tucky statutes knowd as the Corrupt
Practices Act and seem to suggest
that Sir. Pentecost has acted under
the Kentucky law, alleging that Mr.
Howler has not and that he is there
fore out of the race. Mr. Fowler,
when seen today, said: "The Cor
rupt Practices Act only applies to
State, County and District offices.
Section 4 names specifically the off!
cers who shall comply with its pro
visions. The cout of Appeals of
Kentucky have in numerous cases
declared that a Republican Congress
man is not a State officer. I filed a
similar statement of expense, etc.,
with the Clerk of the House of Rep
resentatives and have his acknow
ledgement which reads 'Yours of re
cent date containing statement of
election expense has this day been re
ceived and filed Yours very truly,
South Trimble, Clerk of the Douse.'
This acknowledgement is dated July
23th, 1916, which is within the time
fixed by Federal Statutes."
Mr. Fowler gave out the following
letter to the editor of the Henderson
Gleaner in correction of report that
was published in that newspaper:
Hopkinsvil'e, Ky., July 26, 1916
To the Editor Henderson Glea
ner, Henderson, Ky.
1 Dear Sir: -Your recent article
congratulating my opponent,. lion.
F. J. Pentecost, upon his nomination
as the republican candidate for con
gress in this district is a iittle "pre
vious," and my friends over the dis
trict, at least the more critical ones,
have kept me awake at night inquir
ing if the nomination has really been
made.
"You have unwittingly or unad
visedly, placed an erroneous con
struction on what is familiarly known
as the corrupt practices act, being
chapter 13 of the acts of the general
assembly, 1916. This act is express
ly limited to state, county and dis
trict offices, including representatives
in our general assembly. It has no
relation to candidates for representa
tives in congress The Federal sta
tute which is similar to our state law
requires a statement ot all expenses,
contributions, pledges, etc , to be li'ed
with the clerk of the house of repres
entatives. I have compiled fully
with this provision and hold the re
ceipt of the clerk of the house to this
effect. Will you do me the justice
to print this statement; as my friends
say that congratulations will not be
in order until the evening of August
5, 1816, and after it is over, Mr.
Editor, I promise to remember you
in my telegram of condolence to Mr.
Pentecost.
Yours very respectfully,
W. T. FOWLER "

and the amount saved by buying a
youth's season ticket is 65cts Thus
it will pay to buy a season ticket ev
en if you can not attend all ot the six
sessions.
As stated in last week's issue of
this paper the program as announced
is a most interesting one.
FIRST DAY
There will be two musical concerts
otUhe first day one at 2:30 and one
at 7:30 p. m. These concerts will
be given by the Capital City Concert
Company, the personnel of which in
cludes: Maiian Parkin, soprano so
loist; Collice Trotter Null, violin so
loist; Adah Whitted Strong, pianist.
Each of these ladies is a talented and
accomplished musician and all com
bine the charm of ability and person
ality that has made them so success
ful in their chosen field. Miss Par
kin is also an impersonater and will
give variety to their program by her
costume songs and reading.
The lectures on the first day, one
at 3 p. m and one at 8 p. m. will be
given by Chas. L. Stalker, an enter
tainer and orator of many years ex
perience on the Chautauque platform.
Not only does he have the reputation
of being a polished speaker but he is
also an artist and illustrates his lec
tures with lightning sketches, show
ing scenes and characters as lie hur-
ii:s along.
SECOND DAY
The second day of the program
will be a great day for the children
and young folks as it is on this day
that Irwin 'The Prince of Magic"
appe.arjj q entertain and bewilder us
with his slight of, hand. performances.
In addition to Irwin there will be
Angelo Minnetti, an Italian piano-
a. corainist wno piays tins most me
lodious of all musical instrumjnts
with a dash and style that only the
Italians seem capable of putting into
their playing. Minnetti claims that
the beautiful instrument upon which
he plays and which cost him almost
one thousands dollars is the finest
one in America. It has a volume
and a quality of tone that closely re
sembles, a magnificent pipe organ.
It is on this day, too, that we have
the unusual privilege of listening to
a detailed account of the great war in
Europe, as related by Lieut. Donald
McQibney, an American who spent
several months in the first line trench
es on the battle fields of France,
Lieut. McGidney was attached to the
French ambulance corps and his work
in caring for the wounded between
the battle lines enabled him to ob
serve actual fighting conditions in the
terrible conflict as few Americans
have deen permitted to witness them.
Lieutenant Mr.nihnpv miA rmnu
Itnends among the French officers and
jiwas permitted to take many close up
pictures right in the trenches, a priv
liege not accorded, he claims, to any
other American. These pictures have
have been made into stereopticon
views and are used by Lieutenant
McQibney in illustrating his lectures,
THIRD DAY
'Ihe music on the third day will be
given by a company of talented mu
sicians a motner ana her three sons
"the Dicksons."
Mrs. Dickson is a contralto singer
and pianist; Maurice sings tenor and
plays the clarinet; John sings bass
and plays the violin while Ross has a
baritone oice and also plays the vi
oun. ah are talented musicians
with many years experience on the
Chautauqua platform.
The program is made up of solos,
duets, trios and quartettes, both vo
cal and instrumental. They give one
concert in the afternoon at 2:30 and
a grand closing concert in the even
ing at 7:30.
The lectures on the third day will
be given by Dr. Wm. H. Kent, of
Iowa, who has made a special study
of the small town and the methods
used in building it up. His lectures
are full of inspiration and ideas that
should help to make this community
more progressive and a better com
munity in which to live.
Every person in this community
should hear Dr. Kent lecture in the
afternoon on "The Golden Now" or
"The Small Town Church" and his
wonderfully helpful address in the
evening on "Building Up the Home
Town."
