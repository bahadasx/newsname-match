JUDGE A. M. BARBE
e
Judge Iiarbe Announces
Candidacy for Con giess
Judge A. M. Barbe of Lake Charles
was in Welsh Tuesday in the inter
est of his candidacy before the com
ing democratic primary for represern
tative in Congress from the Seventh
Louisiana District. The Judge seem
ed 'very well pleased with the en
couragement he is receiving and.feels
confident that he will be the next
congressman from this district.
Mr. Barbe needs no introduction to
the readers of the Journal as he was
born and raised in old Calcasieu par
ish near the city of Lake Charles,
has lived here all of his life, and is at
present Judge for this the Fifteenth
Judicial District. He received his
early education in the Convent schools
of Lake Charles and St. Louis col
lege, studying law with Hon. A. R.
Mitchel, one of the most prominent
members of the Calcasieu bar, and at
that time District Attorney, after
which he completed his thorough le
gal training with a two year course
at Tulane University, graduating in
1900, with that famous class which
jpcluded St. Clair Adams, Blanc Mon
roe, Geo. H. Territory and other no
table attorneys of the class of 1900.
Returning home, Judge Barbe be
gan the practice of law in Lake
Charles. In 1912, after he legislative
authorization of an additional judge
for the Fifteenth District, he was
elected over four strong competitors,
taking his seat in April, 1913. This
constitutes the only political office he
has ever held.
As Judge of the district court it is
fair to say that Judge Barbe has made
an excellent record. While he has
tried and decided inany criminal
cases of importance, he has never had
one reversed by the Supreme Court,
and his record on the civil'side is
above the average. In deciding crim
inal cases he has followed the modern
thought that the penalty of an of
fense should be corrective, not venge
ful, and he has therefore shown es
pecial lieniency to first offenders. He
has been watchful of the taxpayers
interests in the conduct of the court,
invariably cautioning grand joures
to watch over perish finances and
keep down the expenses of govern
meat.
Judge Barbe is very closely allied
with the rice interests of this dis
trict which produces 84 per cent of
the entire rice crop of the United
States. -Hailing from four genera
tions of Louisiana's farming folk,
Judge Barb. recalls the first irrigsa
tion canal in the rle. distrclt was dug
on his father's land near lake Ar.
thur when he was but a mere child and
he has since developed an interest
4 ar staple.
I speaking of his position withref.t
es erence to the rice tariff, Judge Barbs
r- said:
n- "I have always advocated a tariff
an rice and if elected, I will not only
-)'vote and work for the restortaion of
th the old rate of two cents a pound, but
n- will strive for an even higher rate if
n-. I find that the interests of the rice
,Is industry require it. I have a finan
xt cial as well as a political interest in
the rice industry. For five genera
tions my family has been associated
to with Southwest Louisiana, and my
as interests are bound up with this sec
r- tion. The rice indusrty is the lead
ing industry of this section, and the
development of my district depends
at upon the development of the rice in
th duatiy. For this reason, and because
is of the further reason that my family
ls is interested financilaly in the rice in
dustry, I will do everything in my
R power to promote\ that industry by
It favorable tariff legislation. I am
at standing on the democratic platform,
rbut I shall not give my support to any
measure which does not provide every
`e protection for the leading industry of
in my district. I will not vote for any
tariff measure carrying less than a
two-cent rate on rice.
"I also fav9r adequate protection
0. for sugar and will use my best en
- deavors to retain the present measure
ce of protection for that indusrty.
"I favor national prohibition as op
posed to local option. I believe the
enforcement of the liquor laws should
b' be placed in the hands of the federal
authorities and taken out of the hands
of local police*officials. I believe it
is. is possible under the constitution for
Congress to enact such a law without.
any further authority. The same au
thority which permitted the enact
ment of the Harrison anti-narcotic
law, would authorize the enactment of
a national prohibition law. The su
preme court, in its rulings on the
white slave law and the anti-cigar
ette laws, has recognized this author
ity. If elected, I shall urge a national
prohibition law along lines similar to
the Harrison drug and narcotic law."
. Judge Barbe is particularly inter
ested in Southwest Louisiana's water
a ways. and he will, if elected to the of
d fice to which he aspires, give much
[ time and effort to their improvement.
He has always been an "outdoor" ,mrn
d and from his earliest years his leisure
time has been devoted to hun
f fishng and boatint, sports to
d his childhood years on the bhnk
Lake Charles had readily inclined blm.
There is not a lake, river, or bkyou
in his district with which he is not
thoroughly familiar.
He is broad-minded, bustling young
d man and his entraee ino the congres
a sional race is a matter which will,
have to be considered by his oppo
i nents.
LOUISIANA FARMERS WILL
TOUR THE NORTH
The Extension Division of the Col
lege of Agriculture of Louisiana State
University with the assistance of ML.
Harry D. Wilson, Commissioner of
Agriculture, will conduct a farm ob
servation tour leaving New Orleans on
the Illionois Central railroad on the
morning of August 22, for the pur
pose of stdying farm conditions, par.
ticularly the dairy industry, in north
ern Illinois, Southern Wisconsin, eas
tern Iowa and the territory around
St. Louis.
The following is a tentative outline
of the tour:
We will spend one day at Cham
paign, Ill., three days in the territory
immediately tributary to Chicago, in
hluding a trip to the Fox river terri
tory, the famous butter center. We
will spend two days in Waukesha
county, Wisconsin, famous the world
over for dairy enterprises. From
there we will go to Madison, the seat
of the State University and Agricul
ture college, visiting the college and
some of the farms in that section of
the state. From there we will go to
'"·rico, Iowa, the home of Kimballs
Dairy Farmer, and from there we will
visit some of the celebrated dairies
and live stock farms of that section.
From there we will return by way of
Freeport, Ill., directly south to St.
Louis and spend one or two days in
the vicinity of St .Louis.
This trip will enable us to see all of
the leading breeds of dairy cattle and
some of the beef cattle and hogs un
der the varying conditions to be
found in these great centers.
The University of Wisconsin, the
University of Illinois, the University
of Iowa, the State Food Department
of Illinois will have representatives to
join the party when we get into their
respective states, and the U .S. De
partment of Agriculture will detail
their extension workers, also, to as
sist in directing the party so as to
get the greatest possible benefit ip
the least possible time.
The cost will be only what you
spend for your own railrood fare,
trolley fare, maintenance, etc. The
round trip tickets from here to Mad
ison, Wis., is $43.60. We estimate
that the side trips will not put the
railroad fare above $55.00. The cost
of sleepers we are not able to ascer
tain yet. We can get a tourist car
with sixteen sections for $25.00 per
day. By using the upper and lower
berths that would be an expense of
$25.00 for thirty-two persons, includ
ing all of the usual service. We can
take a car for three days and then
keep it as loing as we want it with
the privilege of releasing it any day
if we find that we canstop more com
fortalbly at the hotels, or at less
cost. We think a conservative esti
mate for the entire trip will be
5125.00 for fifteen or sixteen days'
travel.
This tour is underthken as part of
the extension work, with the earnest
desire that a goodly party may be
induced to make the trip to see the
rarms of some sections that are pros
pering on live stock enterprises.
