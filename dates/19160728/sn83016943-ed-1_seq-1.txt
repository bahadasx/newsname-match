67th YEAR
MACON, MISSISSIPPI, FRIDAY, JUlY 28. 1916.

Letter From Mr. Haddon
When I was in Washington and New
York City I could have made note of
many things that would have been in
teresting topics for conversation with
my little girl friends in Macon. When
one visi:s a new city for the first time
its beauties and differences to other
cities impress the visitor with much
more interest than they do the fre
quent visitor. No one in New York
'City knew me so I was not one bit em
barrassed to get out in the middle of
a street and count the height in stories
of thj Flat Iron, the Woolworth, the
Equitable Life Insurance and other
tall buildings. I merely wanted to
verify the pictures I have seen in
magazines. My counts tallied exactly
with the pictures so I am satisfied. It
you are not, when you visit that city,
have the courage to do what I did and
you will believe as I do. I walked 37
blocks up Broadway just to see if I
could walk across the city, but along
toward night I asked a policemar,
whose smile made me class him as a
kind hearted Irishman, how much
further to the end of the street. He
looked at me and smiled and said.
"Just 32 miles further." I thought
perhaps he was telling the truth, so I
gave up my proposed , walk. My pas
sage to Rio de Janiero was pleasant
after the first two days out. These
two days I spent in my cabin you see
cabin life was a novelty to me and I
just could nit resist the desire to live
quietly in it for awhile. I was so in
terested in the newness of everything
that I did not care for one bit of food
for the whole of those two days. My
cabin mat, who is chief accountant for
ths National City Bank of New York,
begged me to go up on deck and by all
means I should eat oranges and drink
some brandy, but I knew I was not
hungry arid I also knew the deck was
no place for me. But cabin life is very
hard on one. I think I lost ten pounds
in two days. Perhaps its the seclusion
and the violent exercise the ship sub
jects one to that is responsible. After
passing Cape HatterWe sea was not
rough any more, and the 'further south
we came the smoother the ' waters be
came. The temperature did not rise
above 85 deg. any day and there was
always a good breeze. The nights
were very pleasant and always clear.
But the Atlantic ocean is a thousand
times larger than I thought it. We
were going every hour, day and night,
for over eighteen days. We made but
one halt and that was when the ship
anchored ont in the bay of Bahia for
one hour. It is said to be the longest
trip without a stop in the world. From
New York City to Rio de Janiero is
5405 miles. The furnaces used nearly
2500 tons of coal during the 18 days.
We averaged about 13 naiks per hour
during the trip. Our captain, Cap
tain Codogan, was extremely cautious
at night. No deck lights were on un
til the entire deck was closely cur
tained. All the port windows were
shaded befqre any cabin lights were
turned on. The ship carried no fag
yes, one, but not larger than 9x11,
until we were going into the harbor at
Rio. Capt. Codogan was captain of
the Van Dyke that the Germans cap
tured from the English nearly two
years ago. We received wireless
news daily until we were across the
equator line. No message could be
sent out from the ship's . station. The
stewards of the ship .were young
Englishmen and they were all glad
when we received the news that par
liament had passed the conscription
measure. The wireless operators were
English. They have great faith in
their navy. Too much, it seems, for
they are slow to realize that they
must now be as strong on land as on
the sea.
I shall not try to describe Rio, but I
will say that if there is any poetry,
any love for the beautiful in yourjsoul,
it cannot be dormant when you enter
the bay at Rio just at sunrise. We
had quite a number of passengers
aboard who have seen all of H jrope,
, and parts of Australia and Afri
ca, .-nd they were unanimous In say
ing that Rio and its surroundings
make it the most picturesque city in
the world. It has a water front of 15
miles and all of it laid out with granite
marble, The hotels are .not so good as
sura but the ford is better and the
: M about the same. The speed law
jf the city for autos is very carefully
jbserved the speed limit is the capa
:ity of the engine and every driver
tries to make his car the fastest: The
:ars are all European makes. I did
lot see but one Ford. The driver,
ho, was doing his best to pass a big
Pwiss car ana ine mb
k m ' f a.
ace the Ford seemed to pe noiaing ixs
,ace. There are several things very
oticeable because o! their abwnca.
No one rhews gum. I spent three
days before I found any and it was in
an English store that claims to sell
anything that any other store in the
world does, but it evidently had ilever
old much gum for this was so old it
would "not chew" but crumbled to
pieces, so I ate it for candy. There is
no Coca-Cola none at all; no chewing
tobacco the most glaring absence of
all is there is no breakfast in the
morning. Coffee is drunk all the time.
I've never seen Buch coffee drinkers in
my life. They wake you up at morn
ing with "Cafe. Senor," and then it
goes on all day and till late at night. I
don't drink so I don't get anything for
my breakfast but an orange and a
oolite request for a tip for the waiter's
good services, but I still have them
bluffed with "Eu nao fallo Portuguese"
"I do not speak Portuguese.' He
smilingly backs away with "Nao.
Senor? Obrogado." - "No. Mr.?
Thank you." The men here have a
funny way to greet each other they
embrace and pat each other's should
ers. I went to Rio nbout two weeks
ago to attend a national cotton confer
ence, and four men here went to the
station with me to see me off, and
when they said good bye I was really
embraced four times. I looked about
me to see if anybody was watching. I
can't say that I care very much about
sucn emoraces.
Bello Horizonte is beautifully located
up in the mountains of a high plateau
country. It is nearly 3000 feet above
sea level, and there is a range of hills
just north of the city nearly 3000 feet
higher. The entire country is almost
barren of timber, so the views from
high points are splendid. The city
claims 50,000 inhabitants. It has
about all the conveniences of an Amer
ican city of the same size, It is a
new city only about 20 years old. It
is laid out after the style of Washing
ton, D. C. Some of the streets are
300 feet wide and shaded with palmB
and other beautiful trees. All of the
homes are built of either brick or
stone and covered with clay tile.
There is a large two story Methodist
missionary school in the city, and near
bj a very good church. 'Ibis is under
the i supervision of the M. E. South
Conference. The teachers are nearly
all young ladies from the South. I
went around to Sunday school one Sun
day but there were so many negroes
who wanted to occupy the same seat
with me that I soon slipped out. My
religion isn't quite strong enough yet
to feel just right sitting between two
large but well dressed negroes. I like
to Bee them in the Protestant churches
but I had rather see them from a
greater distance than 16 inches.
The Southern Baptists and the
Southern Presbyterians also have
churches here. Most of the people are
Catholics, but the cultured classes are
not religious at all. It is said only 20
per cent of the people of Brazil can
read, but you don't notice the effect of
ignorance and illiteracy until you go
out into the smaller towns and the
rural districts.
If a young man asks a young lady
to go to the "Cenema" picture show
with him he must ask the entire fami
ly and they are all sure to go. I have
not asked one yet because the fami'ies
are large and it costs 25c. to see the
show.
Brazil is strongly pro-Ally in regard
to the European war. Most German
houses have been blacklisted here.
But most everything in stock in the
stores came from Europe. Very sel
dom is the U. S. A. trade mark seen.
The greatest mistake we make is send
ing commercial salesmen who have no
knowledge at all of the language.
When France, Ei.gland and Germany
send salesmen thev are able to go
right after the trade because they can
Bpeak the language. After the war,
no matter how it goes, we are going
to have to fight for our share of busi
ness in this country.
I am very vaguely informed that we
are in- war with Mexico. So far as I
have heard expressions, Brazil is
strongly on the side with us and re
gards the Mexican as no more than an
anarchist. This letter is for the
school children and I wish I could re
ceive post cards from all of them.

FROM THE PEOPLE
Tht Coming Congressional Election
Edilor of the Boron
Now that the election for congress'
man is.fast approaching, a few word"
in behalf of our esteemed axd efficient
congressman, E. S. Candler may not be
out of place. His close attention to
every request made of him, from the
highest to the lowest, is known of all
men. No letter so badl written out
it receives the same 'careful attention
as one written in the most perfect hand,
or on the most uo-to date typewriter.
In fact. Mr. Candler Bays that many
people who are little accustomed to
writing do not keep writing materia
cdnvenient, and are little accustomed
to writing, do not keep wriling mate
convenient, and are without modern
facilities, and consequently to these, it
is a great deal of trouble to write. To
all who desire his services he extends a
cordial invitation to 'write with what
ever material they may have at hand-
pencil, pen or whatjnot their commu
nication will have every attention.
It is well knowu that he is a member
of thejagricultural cemmittee, a most
important committee, and has always
worked for larger agricultural appro
priotions, so that the agricultural in
terests of the nation might be fostered;
hence we see the great agricultural
awakening throughout the land. Surely
a fit congressman for the first district
of Mississippi.
When the democrats came into power,
he did not seek, but was selebted as
the fittest member of congress to act
as the secretary of the committee of
agriculture.
No man in congress enjoys to a
greater extent the respect and eonfi-
dence of his associates than does Zeke
Candler, and it is certainly a matter of
pride to his constituents that they
never have to feel any uneasiness as to
his position they know that he will
always show up on the right side. After
sixteenn years of service no word or
vote of his has ever been successfully
questioned,
Boiled down, the only argument of
his opponents is that they would like to
have the job. They both are enjoing
lucrative law practices, while Mr.
Candler has no other occupation than
nis office of congressman, than whom
there is no more efficient, conscientious
and useful member in congress.
It will be long before the people of
Noxubee county forget or fail to ap
preciate the service he rendered us a
yecr or two ago, when we were
threatened with an outbreak of char
bon among our cattle. The facts
were wired to him at Corinth, Miss.,
and he was asked if he could help us
he replied that he would try. The
case grew more urgent, and a second
wire was sent askinglf he could get us
expert help, and he replied that he had
a man on the way from Washington,
D. C. The expert came, proper and
prompt measures were taken, and the
threatened outbreak averted.
Mr. Candler's high standing with
the administration is the reason he
was able to give us such prompt as
sistance. It took him years to learn
his duties well and to grow into the
esteem and confidence of the officials
at Washington.
It takes more time to make a good
congressman than it docs to make an
efficient lawyer.
While the heads of the departments
change with the change of administra
tions, the under men who really run
the business of the different deoart-
mer.ts change slowly.
Coming from a line of illustrious
men of talent, Zeke Candler has well
upheld the traditions of his family,
and has reflected credit upon himself
and his constituents. He deserves re
election. He deserves our support.
Yours truly,
Noxubee.
From Big Bud
Macon, Miss., July 26, 1916.
Editor Beacon;
1 understard that Mr. O. Q. Poin
dexter has been tendered a position in
the public schools of the city of Mem
phis by Prof. A. A. Kincannon, and
will likely accept and move to that
city.
Oren made a splendid record as prin
cipal of the Noxubee County Agricul
tural High School, He did a great
work out there and we are very sorry
indeed that such men as Oren Poin
dexter could not be kept in our county.
We wrote an article some years agt
and said that Noxubee's greatest mis
fortune was that we could not manage
to keep the pick of our brainy, splendid
young men, but that every year we
lose a lot who find better positions
elsewhere, Memphis ought to belong
TO THE PEOPLE OF THE FIRST
8UPREME COURT DISTRICT
In announdiiK my candidacy for the
office of Judge of tho Supremo Court
from the Klrst District, It Is right that
I should sot forth the grounds upon
which I ask your considoratlou of any
claims that I may hare upon your bo
port. Tho character of tho offico or
JuJko of the Supreme Court forbids
the employment of tho usual campaign,
methods, and I fepl sure that should I
undertake a campaign of that charac
ter I would justly deserve tho robufce
that would be expressed In your ad
verse ballots. I feel that one seeking
this high preferment should base his
candldaey therefor upon other than
personal or factional grounds In order
ti) deserve the mippw.t of his fellow
clthcns; and thus believing, 1 can
only ask your consideration of such
record as I may havn made as a WI
sen, a lawyer and a jude.
It would not here become me to go
Into any del-all respecting my official
record; that, however, Is open to your
Inquiry and examination. If you think,
on looking into It, that It will justify
your support of my candidacy, I will
be grateful to yon for that favor. It.
Is upon tills record alone that I base
my solicitation of your support, and
I nuiHt be content to stand or fall by
that tent. 1 have been com IniiyiiMly
In tho service of the, State since I was
first elected to the Legislature, six
teen years ago. Appoint, d in i:mh; as
Circuit JuiU'e of the KouuMi Iiistrlct
by Governor Vardamati, I tried to de
serve t.jiat honor. In I w.ih ap
pointed by Governor N'nel.to the Ku
prei bench, 'and In ' 191,'" succeeded
to Mississippi anyway, for a great
majority of her most progressive citi
zens are from Mississippi, and I am
sure that if Oren Poindexter concludes
to cast his lot for good and all in this
city, he will make a record that we
will all be proud of.
If it had not been that the papers
were lost in transit and some of the
witnesses had left for parts unknown,
Oren would have received a Carnegie
medal for an act of heroism in de
scending in an 80 foot old well to
rescue a negro who had been overcome
by foul gas. He almost lost his life in
this attempt and well deserved this
medal.
He is a graduate of thi University
of Mississippi and has taken the short
Farmers course at the A. & M and is
splendidly equipped for the work that
Prof. Kincannon has for him.

Dan Patch Dead
Dan Patch, the most famou3
pacer in tho world's history,
whose record of a mile in 1:5G
remains unbroken, died the
other day at Minneapolis.
While the celebrated horse
was dying his owner, M. W.
.Savage, a wealthy turfman, was
in a hospital recovering from a
surgical operation. The affec
tion existing between Savage
and his great horse was touch
ing, amounting to nothing short
oi nutnan love, wnen tne
owner learned that Dan Patch
was no more he prtw rapidly
worse, and die J on ihe following
day.
in 1002 Mr. Favage purchased
Dan Patch at a cost of (J0,0W,
the hig iest. price ever paid for a
harness horse up to that
time. It proved to be a splendid
investment, for Dan Patch never
lost a race under his ownership,
and paid for h.mself within a
period of two urs. Hie world
record of 1:55 was made 11X)6.
As many Mississippians will
recall. Dan Patch was featured
at the State Fair in this city in
1010, and thousands gathered
each day to see the famous
horse in action. Although he
w as then getting old. he could
easily negotiate the mile in less
than two minutes.

into the unfathomable eyes of

wanted of him, and that he fell
