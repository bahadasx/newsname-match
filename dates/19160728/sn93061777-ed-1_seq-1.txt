PAND0LF0 AUTO PROMOTER
FILES BIG DAMAGE SUITS
Sequel to Public Meeting in Clovis. Warrant Out
For Pandolfo The Promoter.
Although Mr. Pandolfo it ab
sent in person and hia voice is ns
longer heard, yet he is with us
in spirit. This fact was mani
fested Wednesday forenoon,
when by his attorney, W. A.
dilenwater, he filed two civil
suits in the district court of
Curry county for slander and
libel against parties in Clovis.
In the case of Pandolfo vs The
Clovis Journal Publishing Com
pany, a corporation, J. R. Hull,
A. L. Dillon ana F. A. Dillon,
the complaint alleges that the
defenoant corporation publishes
a newspaper, the Clovis Journal
and that the co-defendants are
the principal owners of the stock
therein and manage and control
aid newspaper.
It is further alleged that in
the issue of said periodical of
the date of July 20, 191G there
was therein contained certain
slanderous libellous statements
about and concerning; the plain
tiff, S. C. Pandolfo, as agent
ui.d promoter of the Pan Motor
company, characterizing fhe
plaintiff as a grafter and charg
ing him bb being engaged in
llimllamiiig the people of the
community Hnd applying to him
many other opiobiuus epithets
and slanders. It is further
stated that said newspaper ad
vised the plaintiff that it would
be wise for the plaintiff to be
run out of the town and advis
ing the pursuance of such a
course by the citizens, all of
which tended to blacken the
plaintiff's character and discredit
him with the people of the com
munity and hold aim up to public
scorn and ridicule and to hia
creat humiliation; as damages
he asks the sum of $10,000.
The second case filed is styled
B. C. Pandolfo vs The Clovis
National Bank and Alex Shipley,
and recites in general terms
much the same cause of action
as alleged against the Journal
In the first couat, the plaintiff
takes exception to the style of
oratory indulged in by defendant
Shipley at a promotion meeting
called by the plaintilF at the Elks
Auditorium, Wednesday night
July 19, to explain to his hearers
the great merits of the propo
sition for which he was agent
and promoter. Upon this oc
casion it is alleged, the defen
dant Shipley used some very
harsh, rude and unbecoming
language to which the plaintilF
excepts. In a short address, ac
cording to the complaint, it
would seem, the speaker wan
aged toappiy all the ?itnjr.-tive
words in th Engiisn ian-vge to
the defendant. lie character
ized Pandolfo as a grafter, in
sisted that he had no intention
to establish a factory to manu
facture the Pan Motor auto (to
sell for $500) and advised him
that he had better get out of town
and never show his face in this
county again, with any propo
sition, including life insurance.
And it is further alleged that de
fendant Shipley spoke out in
this meeting and pronounced
the plaintiffs' proposition "rot
ten," "skin tame" and other
derogatory terms that detracted
from the sale of shares in the
Pan Motor Co.
It is also alleged that the de
fendant asserted that plaintiff
had been the promoter of the
Alamo Life Insurance Co. and
that i hose who bought stock in
that company never received a
cent of their money back. Upon
these statements and many
others applied to plaintiff, he
deems himself and his business
damaged lo the amount of
$20,000, and asks judgment for
that sum.
The Second count in the com
plaint, alleges that the Clovis
National bank by its agents and
officers, did willfully, wantonly,
unlawfully and maliciously con
spire and combine together J with
various and sundry other persons
and corporations to destroy and
ruin plaintiff's business.
And that at a meeting, called
in the furtherance of the exploi
tation of the business of the Pan
Motor Co., the defendants at
tended, and that they disturbed
said meeting and then and there
intimated that the plaintiff was a
"grafter" a "thief" and applied
other epithets to him, the said
plaintiff, and that they had there
present, an armed officer, to in
terfere with sail meeting and
frighten this plaintiff and atone
period in the proceedings, said
armed officer seized hold of plain
tiff, all of which, it is claimed,
was done to intimidate and co
erce plaintiff and cause him to
abandon his business as promot
er of the Pan Motor Co.
For the reason set forth in the
second count plaintiff asks for a
judgment for damages to the
amount of $5,000.
As a sequel to the foregoing
proceedings, an information was
filed Wednesday charging S. C.
Pandolfo with criminally libell
ing the Clovis National bank, in
6ome remarks he made in refer
ence to that institution at the
promotion meeting held at the
Elks Auditoriurr, Wednesday
nig ht of last week. The warrant
was placed in the hands of Sheriff
Moye, who started to Tucumcari,
Thursday morning to take the
accused into custody.

JOHN BARLEYCORN REIGNS
IN OUR SISTER CITY
Curry County Town Caters to The Cravings of
Countless Citizens.
The wayfaring man who
journeys over the Santa Fa with
an able consuming thirst anxious
ly awaits the arrival of the train
at Texico, which looms up in his
imagination like "a great rock
in a weary land."
This infant metropolis, with a
population of about a half a hun
dred population caters to the
bibulous taste of a large number
of patrons throughout the South
west. Five liquor houses each
with a wholesale department do
a large, flourishing and profit
able business over a large terri
tory. The farmer in Southwestern
Oklahoma makes merry in the
gladsome harvest time, with the
exhilerating fluid from our lister
city; Not a round up occurs in
the cattle growing district of the
Panhandle of Texas, without a
jug of Texico's choicest bever
age in the chuck wagon, to re
lieve the exhaustion of the
strenuous cowboys; from Clovis
to Carlsbad and in every "dry"
town in eastern New Mexico,
no political meeting, public hold
ing, wedding, christening, or
"wake" is a success unless the
participants are 'gotten into
prine condition and the preper
state of mellowness by the ad
ministration of the revivifying
cordial imported from the Curry
County bibulous center.
The publie service corporations
are also participants in the
profits arising from the exist
ence of this important industry
in our County. More than half
of the telegraphic messages re
ceived in the town are orders for
the several kinds of exhilerating
beverages kept in stock. The
revenue derived from other
merchandise shipped out, pales
into insignificance when com
pared with that received for the
transportation of booze and the
telephone girls at Clovis are
more familiar with calls for 1, 8,
21 and 83 than any others in the
Texico directory.
The jitney lines also realize on
the convivial tastes of the Clovis
citizen, and their cars depart
every 30 minutes for the oasis,
where the bourbon ha3 its habi
tat, where the "wine moveth
itself aright" and where its
patrons can recline beneath the
umbrageous foliage of the An
heuser bush, and look beneath
the foam into the amber depths
of the "Schooner," dream happy
dreams and forget U worldly
cares.
In addition to the jitneys ac
comodations and the Santa Fe's
facilities for transportation a
very large number of private
autos carry their owners and his
friends to the city of Pure De
light. The parties start out vith
grave countenances but with the
light of anticipation in their eyes
and a "gone" feeling in their
systems. But on the return
all is changed. Hilariousness,
good fellowship and conviviality
reigns supreme and the members
of the uartv often break into
song and lift their feet in merri
ment. The little "tin henrys"
become imtued with the spirit
of the occasion, and are sur-1
charged with pugnacity and
bravado to Buch an extremity
that they fearlessly attack a 12
cylinder Caddilac for being in
the road and attempt to butt it
off the track.
When the jitneys are crowded,
the east bound tram have stand
ing room only, and the road to
ward the rising sun is one con
tinued procession of local autos,
the wise Clovis druggist opens
up his bromo-seltzer and places
it on the shelves in readiness for
the early morning rush.
Pandolfsky Motor Promoter
Hikes For Greener Fields
S. C. Pandolfo, the promoter
of the Pan-Motor company, who
was the storm center of a cy
clonic outburst at a meeting of
the citizens held at the Elks
Auditorium, last Wednesday
night, seems to have faded away
on the horizon and the places
that knew him once know him
no more. His agents are also
prominent by their absence and
those who failed to seeure stosk
in this gigantic industry, may
never again be able to avail
themselves of this golden oppor
tunity to grasp riches "beyond
the wildest dreams of avarice."
Starting Poultry Farm
J. W. Wicks, who came to this
part of the country from Ken
tucky is establishing a poultry
tanch Northwest of the city and
has stocked it with S. C. White
Leghorns, pronounced by poultry
fanciers to be the best egg pro
ducing breed ever introduced in
to this country. He has seventy
five hens which have a trap nest
record of laying 200 to 215 eggs
per year on an average. They
were purchased in Saginaw,
Michigan. Mr. Wicks' venture
will be watched with interest by
the farmers of eastern New
Mexico and no doubt many
others will be induced to engage
in this lucrative and interesting
branch of stock raising and
agriculture. The Southwest is
especially adapted to the pro
duction of butter and eggs and
they always find a ready sale at
remunerative prices.
Explains His Proposition
C. A. Roberson, whj is pro
moting the Western Tire & Gar
a,'i C , ailressil a numoar of
interested auditors at the Elks
Auditorium Wednesday night
and made a very interesting and -.
instructive speech. He set
forth, for the benefit of those
present, the excellence of the
product which the company he
represents will manufacture and
the desirability of the stock of
the corporation as an invest
ment. He was listened to with
close attention and his re ;iarks
were frequently grested with
applause. A number of citizens
of Texi:J were present, who
showed by their enthusiasm that
they had the most perfect confi
dence in the project ad its pro
moter.
