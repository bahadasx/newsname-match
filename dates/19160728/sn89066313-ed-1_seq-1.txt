BERI.1X, Julj 2S. "The enemy can
not boast progress," said the war of
fice statement today, referring to Brit
ish attacks in the I'ozieres sector.
"Enemy attacks near I'ozieres and
s-outheast of the Foureaux woods have
l.cen broken down," the statement as
serted. "Hitter hand-to-hand lighting
occurred at I.ongueval and in the Del
ville wood."
"Enemy grenade attacks at Soje
court were repulsed, the statement
continued, and operations at Thiamont
proved unsuccessful.
"Russian attacks northeast of Svvin
inchy gained ground." the statement
reported.
"Counter-attacks are proceeding.
The Austrian drove the Russians
back from advance positions near I'os
tomyti.'' The war office declared that six at
tacks were made by the Russians in
the region of Brody, but the Russian
attacks proved unsuccessful.

The managers of the Roone County
Fair "started something" when they
put up a sign across Broadway from

This action undoubtedly made the

predicts "Roone for IJndsey."

This would save the Allied patrol a
big task, and, as one of the Germans
put it, the Rritish could say: "Oh, I

motives behind orders to delay the

true along the ridge road toward Har
risburg; a few fields are beginning to
tassel out.
There is a much larger acreage of
corn this year than last, and a good
rain would mean dollars in the pockets
of the Boone County farmers. The
condition of the crop around Harg is
better than here, since the showers
seem to fall mostly east and carry-
off In a northeast direction.
Between Columbia and Centralia
the corn is in bad shape and is very
short; some is beginning to tassel, al
though it is only four feet tall. From
Centralia on to the cast, the fields
arc badly burned and only about half
a crop is expected.
The farmers have just begun the
threshing of oats and find that the
average over the county will run
about thirty bushels an acre. The
quality is excellent, and the straw Is
fine.
Much wheat is being brought to Co
lumbia, and although there was only
about half a crop the test on an aver
age is sixty pounds to the bushel;
last year the average was only fifty-
four pounds. Wheat hauled from the
Rollins farm east of town averaged
sixty-two pounds.
Good clover and timothy hay is in
abundance. The grass on the mead
ows is dry and well cured.
Money Being liaised Today for Keokuk
to Jefferson City Railway.
Besides having the political address
es today, Ashland is discussing anoth-
I er project whereby Boone County may
be in line for an electric railway. The
Keokuk & Jefferson City Electric Rail
way, which is now being planned, will
pass through the southwestern part
of the county, touching Englevvood
and Ashland. The neighborhood of
Ashland is asked to raise $1,030, which
is needed to finance the survey in that
community. Monroe County raised its
amount in one afternoon. The Ash
land Bugle says of the railway:
"An effort will be made Friday to
complete tiie raising of $1,030, the
amount asked of this community for
the survey and blue prints of the Keo
kuk &. Jeffercon City Electric Rail
way through Ashland. The road
emerges from Callaway at Millers
burg, coming by Englevvood. Mr.
Knight put the proposition squarely
before the people here last Saturday
afternoon. Action is wanted at once.
W. E. Whitccotton, a prominent Mon
roe County citizen who accompanied
Mr. Knight, is optomistic about the
successful outcome of the proposition.
He said Paris and surrounding terri
tory raised $13."0 for the survey in one
afternoon. He said he found Mr.
Knight, projector of the enterprise,
a man of his word and honest in his
efforts to have the road built. Ten
citizens, we learn, expressed a willing
ness to subscribe $2." each, and that's
a starter. Others a plenty will fall in
line, we are sure."
