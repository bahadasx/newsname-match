THE PROGRESS «F THE WAR.
News from the European conflict
occupy comparatively «mall space in the
daily papers. After two-years, even the
killing and wounding of thousands daily
gets monctonus and stale. The world is
getting hardened to bloodshed. Only
such extraordinary events as the German
attack on Verdun or the late "drive" of
the allies arouses more than.easual in
terest. But there is one part of the
telegraphic news that is of more than
ordinaiy interest—to those vitally inter
ested—the published lists of .killed,
wounded and missing. Those who have
never had friends or dear ones in eon
tending armies can hardly realize the
tragic interest with which a mother* a
wife, a sister or a sweetheart scans these
lists, so closely and yet so deardingly.
In these lists "no news is sure good
news" to these readers.
The British and French have appa
rently held all of their last month's gains
notwithstanding many fierce assaults
made by the Germans, and later reports
are to the effect that they have made
some small gains while heavy lighting is
going on for the possession of certain
points. At Verdun there is sporadic
lighting but the heavy offensive of the
Germans has apparently abated.
The Russians report gains practically
all along the lines from Riga south and
in some places have their enemies on the
retreat. In the far east Grand Duke
Nicholas is beating the Turks according
to the Russian reports. The Italians re
port gains against tbe Austrians. Thus
Germany and Austria appear to be on
the defensive on all side9.
It is reported that the Swedes who
enjoyed a very lucrative trade with Ger
many across the Baltic are very angry
with Britain since the latter has tight
ened the blockade so that trade has
nearly stopped.
The merchant-submarine "Deutch
land" is still at Baltimore at this writing,
loaded and ready to run the^ blockade of
British men-of-war, a number of which
are reported outside the capes on the
watch for her. The "Bremen" a sister

thing that could ihQppen to that divided

more than anything else. Jf «e could
once get them united then we could
either pound or put -some .sense into
-them. And we willlhave to do it :event
tually, why not now?"
TRACTOR (FARMING.
The farm tractor is here to stay. .As
yet 'the tractor is in .an -experimental
kge .in several important particular^,
but has passed the experimental stage
as a general utility farm machine. .It
will take time and experience to work
•out its economical features, and use, 'but
that it is useful is no longer a.question.
There,are now more thanone hundred
.and fifty different manufacturers of farm
.tractors,-as well as an almost innumer
able number of patents. This in itself
«how3 the-demand and sales.
The tractor is to some extent a sort of
by-product «f the automobile and especi
ally of the auto-truck-motor., but as an
aetuality it is more and more beginning
to resemble a stationery engine on
wheels driven by its own power.
In .the development of the farm tract
or, rather strangely, the heavy powered
type was the first. Such tractors were
atted to pull from eight to twelve plows
and could also be used as threshing pow
ers. During the fast few years the one
man, two or three plow machine has
been developed and is proving the most
popular.
So far in the mechanical contest be
tween large and small tractors perhaps
as yet we have not arrived at any very
definite conclusions as to economy except
that generally speaking'the small tract
or is better for the small farm. The
first cost may have considerable to do
with this matter as the small farmer
6eems willing to invest say $500,00 to
$1,000 in a small tractor when he would
not be willing to invest from $1,500 to
$2,500 in the larger machine.
Generally speaking there seems to be
but little difference in the cost per acre
between the large and small machines
provided both machines run steadily
day in and day out. And the cost pBr
acre for either when figured in all de
tails does not vary very much from the
horse drawn plows.
As between horse power and gasoline
power the question of economical work
has yet to be definitely settled as to dol
lars and cents. But in another eco
nomical sense there are great differences.
It seems to be a settled fact that there
are times and places when the horse is
the better machine while at other times
the gasoline power is the best.
We heard a man say that he could
plow more in a season with four horses
than anyone could with a three-plow
tractor. Perhaps in this statement he
struck at the root of the whole matter.
On Saturday we saw the so-called "Haj.
py Farmer" tractor drawing three plows
through four inches of dry quack grass,
pasture sod at a gait of about three
miles per hour and apparently doing it
with ease and was not sweating a bit
though the day was very warm. And
the tractor named is typical of several
other machines that are doing similiar
work in this locality.
It is apparent that the remark of the
gentleman jould not be true in that case.
No four horses could have worked but
The real question it sot what Stractor
can do in aa hour hot what it oak, do in
a day, perhaps not even what it' aUy do
in some oertain week, but whtti can it
do in a month or for the whole jrfelt? 1B
other words ds it reliable? Willlt stay
on the job? Will it work ten, twelve,
fourteen hours a day for six day* in the
week and four weeks in a month?
When the Praetor is made thft will
work like that it will have to be simple,
strong and have considerable leeerve
power at aH times. These three ele
ments are what are necessary to keep it
out of the repair shop. Simplicity is
necessary because the operators are aot
usually expert machinists. Simplicity
will make aocidents more easily focseen
and prevented, and repairs more readily
made.
Reserve power is also a necessary
thing in all machinery. No machine
ought to be expected to "stand-up" un
der a full strain at all times. An auto
is rarely ealled-.on for but a small psrt
of its power, but a farm traotor is ex
pected to run ten,hours or more a day
pulling a full load and do it day after
day. That is expecting a great deal
from apiece of machinery.
But as we said at the first, tractors
have come to stay. Hundreds of tract
ors are now working in this valley and
doing good work. They may never take
the full place of farm horses, but that
they will take thejilace of some of the
farm horses and do .it well, has already
been demonstrated beyond reasonable
doubt.
INFANTILE PARALYSIS
Infantile paralysislsincreasing through
out the eastern cities and apparently
.gradually working its way westward.
In New York city where it first smarted
as an epidemic there have been uearly
.100 deaths of children from this di&tese
which shows a mortality of about one
out of every four or five cases. Besides
this it would have perhaps been better
that many of those who have lived if
they had died rather than be more less
helpless cripples for the rest of their
lives.
As yet the dread diseases is more ter
rible because of the want of knowledge
concerning both its contagious or epide
mic character as well as treatment of the
victims. In all these so far, doctors are
practically at sea. While quarantine
measures are being taken, yet nobody
knows just how the disease spreads.
Nobody knows why it is specifically a
disease of children while adults are rare
ly affected.
Sporadic cases are likely to appear in
and place though very often other cases
in the same locality will occur and later
the disease will disappear. This has oc
curred in places all over the country in
clvding this valley iu past years, but
this is the first time that the disease ha6
assumed so great proportions in so large
apart of the country.
While we may congratulate ourselves
that we at present appear farfrom the
shadows of this infantile mortality, yet
we are not immune and whether in town
or country we should keep a sharp
look-out and anything at all suspicious
should be reported at on^e to some local
physician.
PEMBINA—THE PRETTY.
Perhaps in no one thing have the peo
ple of this city been more negligent than
in advertising the natural beauties and
advantages of this little city and sur
roundings. While the citizens have en
joyed these beauties and advantages,
many of them since they were born, yet
few have really realized them, fewer yet
have ever sized them up in comparison
with the prairie towns near and' distant,
and fewer yet have thought it worth
while to tell anybody outside about it
and invite them to come and see.
During the years past the city authori
ties have quietly acquired some twenty
or thirty acres of park sites within the
city.limits but as yet little effort has.
been made to add to nature's gift? in
adornment and care. Besides the land
acquired by the city, a lar^e part of
which is wooded, many miles of wood
land occupy the banks of the Pembina
and Tongue rivers, mostly in their prim
eval state. Woods, prairie and the wat
ers of the three rivers give a variety of
scenery, and shelter and beauty that are

Strength in a tractor is necessary, but
the addition of unnecessary weight is
undesireaole. Only the repair ehop will
in time bring the desired minimum of
weight and the maximum of strength.
When the manufacturer finds that one
certain part «f his machine iB continu
ally breaking he knows that pert needs
more or better metal when he finds
another part .is rarely broken then he
studies if he will not be able to reduce
the metal in that part. That has been
the history of-all farm machinery and is
now the studyof the automobile makers.

GOOD ROADS AND
APPROPRIATIONS.
Below we give an extract of what the
government is doing to help along road
building. This is only the beginning. It
will not be long before all the trans-con
tinental highways will be kept np under
the supervision of the government and
than we people in the Red River Valley
can look for the best roads of any place
on the American continent. All these
highways which have been designated
as leading thoroughfares between larger
commercial points, like the Meridian
•Road and others will be of immense
rvalue to people living in the neighbor
hood traversed by these roads. Don't do
anything that will tend to obstruct a
imain highway that is officially marked
but do every thing you can to keep it in
.good repair. The following is the ex
.tract:
'The sum of $85,000,000 of Federal
funds is made available for the construc
tion of rural roads, by the passage of the
Federalaid road bill which became a
law on July 11, 1916. Of this sum,
$35)000,000 is to be expended for the con
struction of rural port roads under coop
erative arrangements with the highway
departments of the various State*, and
$10,000,000 is to b9 expended for roads
and trails within or partly within the
national forests. The act limits the Fed
eral Government's share in road work in
coopesation with the 6tates to percent
of the estimated cost of construction.
Federal aid may be extended to the con
struction of any rural post road, exclud
ing all streets or roads in towns having
a population 2,500 or more, except the
portions of such streets or roads on
which the houses are, on an average,
more than 200 feet apart.
Five million dollars is made available
for expenditure during the fiscal year
ending June 30, 1917, and thereafter the
appropriation is increased at the rate of
five millions a year until 1921, when the
sum provided is twenty-five millions,
making a total of seventy-five millions.
In addition, an appropriation of $1,00D,
000 a year for 10 years—a total of $10,
000,000—is made available for the devel
opment of roads and trails wholly or
partly within the national forests.
The class of roads to be built and the
method of construction are to be mutu
ally agreed upon by the Secretary of
Agriculture and the State highway de
partments.
This writer found plenty of black rust
in the wheat near McArthur last Friday.
As yet it was but slightly developed and
the extent of future damage only to be
guessed at with the question of weather
as a large factor. The weather of the
week has brought showers and some
what cooler weather than the week pre
vious. The showers were welcome and
will benefit late barley which was need
ing rafa very badly. Harvest will be on
hand at about the usual date owing
largely to the hot weather of July which
hastened the growth of vegetation al
most miraculously. The wheat market
has been advancing rapidly this week
owing to the black rust reports.
The Republican state committee re
solved to accept to nominations made at
the late primary. "In the spirit in
which they are made." Now, the only
question remains is to name the brand
of the "spirit." Perhaps if a specimen
were sent to Prof. Ladd, the famous
North Dakota pure food expert, he
might make a chemical analysis and de
cide whether the constituents may pro
perly and legally be labelled "republi
can".
Way down in Dixie, Texas, tiye con
gressmen who have supported President
.Wilson's Mexican and Eurpopean war
policies have been retired at the primary
elections and Governor Colquitt who has
been outspoken against Wilson has been
renominated. It would not be very re
markable if Texas and perhapr some
other border Btates cast a very heavy
vote for Hughes for president this fall,
though of course it would take a very
heavy vote indeed to evercome the nor
ms! democratic majority of those states.
