PYTHIAN PICNIC
WAS BIG SUCCESS
juried Members Again Demonstrate
Their Sii|H*riorit,v at RnoeliaU
ami Pool Racing
Success again marked the annual
picnic of Eveiitus Star lodge, No. 26,
Knights of Pythias, which was held
Sunday at the grove on the Weeks
farm south of town, and the big
crowd of Pythiahs and their families I
and friends declare it was the most
enjoyable of these events yet held.
Forgetting th.r mature dignity, the
older people vied with the little folks
in having a .agular picnic time ami
the result watt a jolly crowd ready
for anything that gave promise of
fun and excHement. Sports of all
kinds were arranged for both young;
and old and were entered into with '
a wholeheartedness that resulted in
amusement to both contestants and
spectators, a«.d the shady secluded
grove echoed with the laughter and
shouts of the picnickers throughout
the day.
In all kinds of conveyances from
bicycler and horseback to big auto
mobiles, the large crowd was taken
from Pullman and vicinity to the pic
nic grounds, the lodge furnishing
a bis carryall for those who mad"
no other arrangements to get to the
grove. The time before dinne:' was
spent in mixing together and getting
better acquainted with each other
and the spot selected for the picnic.
The committee had provided swings
for the children and these were in
constant demand from start to fin
ish, but we£e no more popular than
the ice cream and lemonade also
furnished by the lodge in such quan
tities that even the repeated, con
tinuous and persistent onslaughts of
both old and young failed to show a
diminishing supply, The ice cream
freezers were opened at noon and
kept open until the last person had
left the scene, while the lemonade
Jar, constantly replenished by Dr.
Hudson and Max Reed, defied even
the mad rushes of the thirsty par
ticipants in the athletic events.
At dinner time the crowd divided
itself into small and large groups and
Proceeded to do Justice to their well
filled baskets and judging from the
sounds that filled the cool shady
-rove this was a very agreeable hour.
Though the crowd was divided Into
many groups this did not affect the
"nity of the picnic as it was a com
mon sight to see dishes passed from
m table to another throughout the
Period allotted for eating. After
dinner the time was spent in quiet
amusements while the tables were
cleared, the children swinging and

Elmer Johnson, a United States
j rural engineer, who has been sent
out by the department, of agriculture
j to demonstrate a new device for ex
tinguishing fires in threshing ma
chines, will be in Pullman next Fri
day. August 1, and will give a dem
onstration during the afternoon at
some point in the business part of
town. A large attendance of thresh
|er men and fanners is expected.
Mr. Johnson has been giving demon
strations at numerous points in this
state, which have aroused much In
I teres! and enthusiasm.
When at Walla Walla a now Sep
j arator was rigged and was filled with j
Isi raw. Smut powder was put into
'tin- machine and the whole was ig
nited by lighting rags soaked in gaso
! line. Almost Immediately flames
were coming out from all parts
of the machine. The extinguisher
was then turned on and in less than
a minute the fire was extinguished.
Farmers who witnessed the demon
: stration expressed their intention to j
equip their separators with the ex
tinguishers. The est Of installation
• ' is placed at less than $50.
The device itself is not so much
i for the prevention of smut explo
sions as for the automatic extin
guishing of the fires which fol
i low, and Which are responsible, for
, the most serious losses. The extin
guisher itself is rather simple, but
for efficiency it bears the stamp of
i approval of the government experts.
■! A 40-gallon tank of water is fast
iLd to the threshing machine and
■pipes are run to all part* of the sep
arator. When a fire starts it melts
' fuses, a bottle of acid is tipped over
and Die gas tones the water out at
high pressure. It is claimed by the .
. government engineers that the at
tachment will extinguish a separator I
, fire almost instantly. The nozzle is I
patented by the government and any- j
, one may use It.

PULLMAN. WASHINGTON, FRIDAY, JULY 28. 1916
Taxpayers League Issues Bulletin
«)l>.i«Ms ol the Organisation l'.\
plained ami Plans anil Scope of
Work Outlined
The first of a series of monthly
bulletins to be Issued by the Tax
payers Association of Whitman
Count) is being distributed by Sec
retary i:. A. Thompson, it Bays, In
part
"The Whitman County Taxpayers
association owes its existence to a
prevalent belief that the taxpayers
do not get their moneys worth' lor
he taxes bey pay.
"It is the purpose of the associa
tion, by Investigations, to establish
the fact whether or not the common
opinion that taxes are too high for
the benefits received. Is correct, and
if correct, to show where the waste
occurs, to put the linger on the spot,
and to attempt to stop the leaks, if
such exist, as far as possible under
the existing laws, and if the laws are
found wanting, to recommend the
changes, and try to get them enact
ed by the legislature.
"It is probable that there is some
waste in the present system of
count) government, because old .sys
tems ami practice, have been fol
lowed from Near to year, which
should be superseded by more mod
ern methods of doing business, and
it will probably be established that
the people an- demanding much more
in public service these days, and re
quiring these Improvements, must
expect to pay for them, and may as
well pay for them cheerfully, and,
stop grumbling.
"It is not the conception of those
who are concerned in the present
management of the association, that
ii should be used for muck-raking,
or playing politics. The taxpayers
are not concerned in the taxes they
have paid; that is gone and can no
lie recovered. They are not interest
ed in suppositions, but want facts,
and they certainly do not want the
association to mix in county politics.
"It is not believed necessary to
adopt a suspicious attitude toward
everything and everybody, but they
do desire to he shown.
"It does not desire to antagonize
the Incumbents of the county offices,
and it hopes to have the fullest co
operation of all county officials, and
it may be slated that so far. it has
been assisted most agreeably by all
county officials wherever their as
sistance has been required.
"The association expects to do Its
work mainly through its secretary,
supervised by its officials, and spe
cial committees, and assisted by the
executive committee, consisting of 33
members, representing every town
and trade center in the county.
"An examination of the auditor's
report for 1915 will show levies for
schools and education of $479,148.
--61, for roads $232,1 15.51, for mu
nicipalities $104,190.32, and for
county expenses 198,194.80. These
levies represent the major part of the
taxes paid In the county, and in the
consideration of them lies the chief
work of the association.
Committees
"Special committees have been
proposed, each to have a particular
part of the above work assigned to it.
A committee on schools and educa
tion, a committee on roads, a finan
cial committee, which in addition to
caring for the finances of the or
ganization, will look after current ex
pense business, and a legislative com
mittee to further efforts to secure
such remedial legislation as the in
vestigations of the association might
suggest as necessary or advisable.
•Municipal expenditures, being
entirely local, do not fall within the
scope of a general committee. Re
suits will be attempted through the
secretary working in conjunction
with the members of the executive
committee for each particular mu
nicipality, assisted if practicable by
local committees.
"The secretary is the vital feature
lofI of the working plan of the associa
tion, and so far the principal efforts
J of the organization have been in the
! preparatory measures taken to se
, cure the secretary and get him in
| stalled."
In regard to the connection be
tween the league and the railroads
I the bulletin says:
'
"It is advisable at this time to
make a distinct statement of the re
lations that exist between the Tax
pay.-is' association and the railroads
that are contributing to the support
of the organization, Already there
have been implications that the or
ganization exists mainly for the bene
lit of the railways, and there is like
ly to be more of such talk as the
work of the organization progresses,
from those who for any reason are
unfriendly to the purposes of the
Taxpayers' association.
"The purpose of the Taxpayers' as
sociation, and its sole reason for ex
istence, is to promote efficiency and
economy in the disbursements of
public moneys This does not mean
that taxes are to be lowered by cut
ting out some of the conveniences
and advantages which the people of
this counts have been enjoying. The
taxpayers of Whitman county want
to continue to build good roads; they
expect to keep on improving their
school facilities; the county's affairs
must he administered liv competent
officers and employes. Lower taxes
must come entirely from a better use
of the money expended.
"The Taxpayers' association has
undertaken the task of putting Whit
man county in the position of a care
ful, frugal, prosperous man who
spends his money for the necessities
and comforts and enjoyments of life
with a prudent regard to his income,
and who gets full value for every
dollar he spends. An efficient and
thrifty man clothes himself and his
family well, lives in comfort, and has
al! the necessities and many of the
luxuries of life, while a careless and
wasteful man, with the same in
come as the other, will have a diffi
cult time making ends meet. The
difference between two such men is
merely a matter of efficiency in
money matters.
Full Value From Taxes
"The efforts of the Taxpayers' as
sociation are directed towards mak
ing Whitman county a community
where the benefits of good govern
ment and modern public improve
ments art; enjoyed without the bur
den of excessive taxation. It is not
therefore a question of reducing
taxes by doing without the things
that a prosperous community should
enjoy, but a question of getting full
value for every dollar spent, confin
ing our public expenditures within
the bounds of prudence and nol sav
ing at one place only to waste at an
other."
The bulletin then goes into detail
regarding the starling of the move
ment and the possibility of ihe sug
gestion coming from the railroads,
"The association desires to assure
the people of Whitman county that
it does not contemplate a reduction
Of taxes at the expense of good roads
or good schools. Such a program
WOUld suit the railroads, who are
merely interested in less taxes, but
the association is composed of men
who are devoting their time In an
effort to make Whitman county a
better place in which to live. In
case of a conflict between the inter
ests of the railroads and the good of
Whitman county, these men are un
hampered and propose to remain un
hampered to do what the best Inter
ests of the people of Whitman county
dictate."
Copies of the bulletin can be se
cured from E. A. Thompson, secre
tary of the association, whose office
is in the Hamilton block in Colfax.
Copies will be mailed to those re
questing them, in addition to the
great number sent to persons whose
names are available. The August
bulletin will deal with the activities
of the road and finance committees,
which have already been appointed.

Hundreds of Boys and (.iris
This Fall
In all probability the annual fair
and exhibit of the boys and girls in
terested in the various county clubs
will be. held this fall in Pullman, the
matter now being in the hands of
the agricultural committee of the
chamber of commerce. These fairs
are held in each county in the state
where the boys' and girls' clubs are
maintained, and the winning ex
hibits, together with eight of the
prize winning boys and girls, are
sent to the state fair at North Yak.
ima for state competition. Over 800
boys and girls are interested in club
work in Whitman county, according
to the statement of Hruce Lampson,
who has charge of the work, and It
is estimated that fully 400 exhibits
will be available for the county dis
play.
The total cost of the fair, includ
ing prizes, will be in the neighbor
hood of $200, and there is little
doubt that the, chamber will be suc
cessful in bringing the attraction to
Pullman.
Through the county school super
intendent $50 is given in each county
to assist in sending a team of eight
prize-winning boys and girls to the
state fair at North Yakima, to be
held this year September 18 to 23,
and the county exhibit will be held
just shortly before these date;, The
team of young farmers and house
wives includes three winners from
the canning clubs, two in stock

asmuch as there are no sewing clubs
in operation in this county, one mem
ber of the team will be eliminated.

NUMBER 41
TWO METHODS FOR
RELIEF FROM SMUT
I \|> runouts Conducted at State Sta
tion Give Satisfactory I les v Its—
Planting and Soil Tillage
ttig Factors
Alter four years of extensive study
and Investigation, the experts of the
slate experiment station have arrived
at a actor) conclusion concern
ing relief from wheat smut, and the
results of the experimentation will
in- hailed with delight by thousands
of farmers who have seen millions
of dollars slip through their fingers
annually as a result of the depreda
tions of the smut pest. In a state
men! Issued this week, Dr. Ira l).
Cardiff, director of the station, who
has given much attention to means
of eradication of smut, said:
"We thought that we had the solu
tion last year, and now we are sure
of it.
"Either one of two methods ni ay
be followed by wheat farmers, They
may sow winter wheat before threat]
ing time or they may sow at the usu
al time in summer fallow, first giv
ing the land a deep replowlng.
"Smut is a fungous growth. The
spores on the wheat grain grow on
the Inside of the wheat plant, show
ing again in the grains of seed. The
spores are blown about at threshing
time.
"If planting is done before thresh
ing, the resulting wheat crop is found
to be absolutely free of smut
"If planting is done after thresh
ing time the smut spores are scatter
ed about the ground, but can be turn
ed under and out of the way of tin
wheat by deep plowing In our ex
periment work half of one field was
subjected to deep plowing; the other
half was not. The wheat planted on
the replowed ground has less than
one per cent smut; thai on the Other
half 2", per cent.
"Another experiment we conduct
ed to show that the smut spores are
a menace only on the surface was to
burn straw on a field. The wheat
which came up later showed abso
lutely no smut. This is not recom
mended, as the practical method,
however. In the first place a wheat
grower would not have sufficient
straw, and In the second place the
burning injures the soil."
Dr. Cardiff said the equipment of
threshing separators with blowers, to
clear the wheat from smut, separat
ing the smut in hags so as to prevent
it from being scattered, was also
recommended.
CYRIL DAWSON MARRIED
From San Francisco papers the
news has reached Pullman of the
marriage of Lieut. Cyril A. Wlnton
Dawson of the 39th coast artillery,
now temporarily stationed at Ca
lexico on the Mexican border, to Miss
Clara Louise Hatteroth, daughter of
Mr. and Mrs. William Hatteroth of
SanFrancißCO. It was originally in
tended to have a church wedding at
a later date, but the sudden mobiliza
tion on the Mexican border changed
their plans and Miss Hatteroth ac
companied by her mother, met the
lieutenant at a border town, where
the marriage was quietly solemnized.
According to present orders Lieut.
Dawson expects to leave for Manila
early In the fall and before taking
up his duties there will be granted
an extended leave of absence, when
the young couple will motor north
through California and visit the lieu
tenant's parents in Pullman and
later extend their trip through Japan
and China, arriving at the Philip
pine station in November.
WHEAT PRICKS CLIMB
In sympathy with the Chicago mar
kets, grain prices have climbed stead
ily during the past few days and sev
eral consequential sales have been
made. The local markets have been
featured by the heavy sales of oats,
which now bring $1.10 the hundred
weight, although several wheat sales
are reported. Yesterday's quotations
were as follows:
