Mexicans Murdered
on E. P. S. W. Tracks
Killed on Railroad and Bodies
Dragged into Bmhei. Could
' not be Identified.
Two tb'itd Mexicans wore found
about two miles west of town lust
Sunday, who Imd evidently been
iht victims of foul piny. They
hud been killed on the. railroad
nid their bodies dragged off Into
the bushes by their murderers,
apparently to conceal t li o m.
They were llrst discovered Sun
lay morning and word was given
the local authorities, who sum
moned a jury and an inquest was
held
The jury was composed of 15
.1 Kulton; N- J- Yarbrough; Rue
Leininon; Cecil McAuley; James
II. Poff and G. E Parks. The
verdict rendered was that the
two unknown Mexicans had met
their death from unknown
i'.iusei The bodies were in such
.i decomMised condition that it
was iinpo-sil Id to make a tho
rough investigation. O n e of
I hem had been il rallied feet fore
most and his clothes were most,
all torn from his body. Blood
sooU were to be seen on the road
and it was an easy matter to
t race them to vvhoie the bodies
were tound.
Two hats were found near the
bodies, supposed to have been
the property of the Mexicans.
A bullet hole was found in each
but whether the holes had been
made while the hats wens on
their heads is of course unknown.
I lie re is no cluu as to the guilty
Mi-ties.
From the indications we judge
that the Dwdirs Had been lying
i here lor ni it nst two or three
ii.iys No p.ipurs or anything
could be found on them to indl
. ate who they were or where
(hey had come from.

THE DOLLAR OR DIME
Money for Boundary Highway.
Sti.itegie highways can now be
constructed pursuant to the pro
vlsioi s of the $r,000,()00 federal
aid roads bill which has just been
signed by President Wilson. The
first of these highways ncces
sary lor military purposes would
naturally be the road which
parallels the boundary between'
the United States and Mexico, i
and traverses the states of New
Mexico, California and Arizona
The cost of constructing these
jointly built highways is to be
borne Tit) per cent by the federal
government and Til) per cent by
the states; the federal monies
being divided In proportion to
area, population and post road
mileage.
New Mexico has a very large
allowance of this fund, and while
it is not very likely that any
.itate money can be secured Tor
purpose of building a road along
the border from Ki Paso to the
Arizona line, it is likely that the
authorities will do everything in
their power to get the money on !
a road that is many miles north j
of tho international boundary.
The people residing in the
southern part of the state should 1
investigate aud learn what will,
be expected of them to get this
road through. A road built
across thu state twenty or even
ten miles north of the boundary
would be of no use to the military
at all, aud if thu matter is put up
to the proper authorities it seems
to us that it will bu easy to con
vince them that the road should
be built direct from KI Pa-o to
Douglas, Arizona.
Plans for New Town
A movement has been started
for the establishment of a new
town northwest of Coltnubus,
supposed to be for tho purpose
of selling boozu to the soldiers.
J. H. Hell and an KI Paso attor
ney by thu name of McMahon
are supposed to boat the bottom
of the s heme.
The booze proposition' looks
too good to be passed up when a
new town can be established, and
as soon as it has the necessary
inhabitants a saloon license be
secured.
The army oflieers got wind of
the scheme and stopped work on
the camp for a short time, but
when they learned that it would
take at least one year's time to
secure a saloon license pioviding
that they had the necessary
Imputation, aud that then the
license had to be obtained from
thu county commissioners, who
can use their own discretion in
the matter ol issuing a license,
they decided that there could be
no reasons for holding back the
work on the camp for one minute
on this account.

Clancy Gives Another Opinion
Lust week published an
opinion of Attorney Generul
Clancy on the status of New
Mexico militiamen in regard to
tho elective franchise. In this
opinion Clancy is quoted as say
log that they will have the right
vote this full in national, state
and county elections in the
county in which they happened
stationed.
Now a letter has been received
by a friend of Mr. Clancy's stat
ing that no written opinion had
been given from his oilice, but
that the matter was hastily dis
cussed in the presence of a re
porter. The attorney's atten
Hon has been called to an article
of the state constitution which
declares that no person shall be
deemed to have acquired or lost
resilience by reason of his pre
sence or absence while employed
in the service of the United
States This provision, Mr. Clancy
rightly states, is controlling, and
those members of the National
Guard who are not bona tide resi

RIGHT HERE AT HOME
Casey at the Bat
, ,.rtse the wire court
which attracted no small amount
of attention was heard
last
Friday
Harry J. Casey, local
jeweler, had been arrested on
the charge of disturbing the
peace. The police oflieers say
that he was trying to start a
row between the soldiursnnd the
police fort e.
Casey was arresU-d anil taken
to police headquarters ami was
ordered taken to the bull pen.
Hefore taking him down there
I the chief ol police ordeted the
o llicer who had him In charge,
Clilfoitl Truiuble, to sei-rch loin.
Casey resented th s action on
the part of the ofllcer, and
strongly resisted Whether it
was done accordini: to rules in a 1
. . . . . . i
case ol mis icinu we are unauie
to say. The policeman stated
that lie only hit him open handed,
but others say the ollicer's list
was used. Thu army .surgeon
found it necessary to set the
bone in Casey's nose, which had
teen broken.
Two days alter the arrest
Casey was tried in Judge Peach's
court on a charge of resisting
an ofticur, and was sent to the
grand jury. His bond was fixed
at $.")U0, which was promptly
made. No other charge was
made against liuu, and he imme
diately tried to lake out a war
rant for thu oflicer who hau
Uuatcn him up. This was re-
tusud on the order of Major
Wuddell, District Attorney.
Cusey's friends du not uelluve

"Tommy" Returns From Front
Thomas G. Lucklunu returned
Monday to Colu'iibus from the
camp of the lUtli Cavalry ' some
where in Mexico," after an ab
sence of over four months. Luck
land was in the mountains work
ing his mining claims when the
Columbus raid happened. Soon
as he heard of it he walked into
town, his horse having broken
loose. When the expedition after
Pancho Villa was being organized
he offered his services us scout.
The oftieers had no appropria
tion to pay the scouts, and so
Tommy volunteered to go any
way, anil did not know until a
short time ugo whether ho wus
on the pay roll or not.
He was with the VM Cavalry
from the time they left here on
March Kith until lust Friday. As
long as there was hopes of ex
cltetnent he stayed on the job,
but when the troops went into
camp without any hopes of re
sinning the chase after Pancho
he decided to come home. So
fur us we know he is the only
man who was with the expedi
tion that was not promised pay
or had a good idea that he would
receive a sulary for all the time
he hud been with the expedition.
A more patriotic man than
Tommy would be hard to tlnd,
and now he suys thut if anything
starts ugaln he is going back to
the front and give thu govern
ment his services.

Government Wants
Leases on More Land
Larger Area Needed for the
Establishment of Militia Camp
Northwest of Town.
A meeting of the principal busi
ness mun of Columbus and Cap
tain Pearson, Q. M. C, was held
in the bank building Sunday
morning. Captain Pearson in
formed the citizens that the com
manding oilicer had dee'ded that
unless a larger area of land could
be obtained no further prepa
ration for the establishment of
the militia camp north west of
town would be made.
The governmental present has
leases on the quarter sections of
A. L. Taylor, W. C. Miller, T. A.
Hulsey and J. H. Cox. This gives
them one squr.re mile, which they
claim was not sufficient, and so
they asked for the quarters sur
rounding this section, which
would give them four square
miles of space for their camj .
Most of the leases were guaran
teed immediately nfter it was
learned what was wanted, the re
maining quurter sections being
owned by people who did not re
side in the valley. The owners
were wired at once and most of
them have sent back fovorable
messages. If there is any ex
pense in addition to the small fee
the government has offered the
balance will be subscribed by the
business men of Columbus.
The llrst well on the noetio l
leased has been completed and Is
now being pumped. It is located
on the tract leased from A. L.
Taylor, and while it is not as good
a well as was expected, it furnish
es about thirty gallons of water
per minute, and will probably
give more after it has been
pumped for a few days.
A. G. Beck has offered his well
and pumping plant to the govern
ment free of charge if more
water for troops is required be
fore the new camping grounds
can be made ready. His plant
will furnish water sufficient for
two or or three regiments, and
General Funston has been wired
that we are now oreoared to
supply water to many more
regiments.
