UP TO VOTERS OF
OLD TENNESSEE
Is Tennessee to couliuue a lag
gard iu population and industrial
development? Are the other
Southern States to continue grow
ing at a rate two and one-half times
: as rapid as we? '- Of the fifteen
States engaged in cottou uiauufac
iuring are we -to continue foot?
.Are we to continue living uudera
constitution made for a small agri
cultural population and which we
, liave lone since outgrown? Are
....
vre longer to put up with a govern
ment so expensive and eo inefficient
that it costs the tax payers twenty
or twentyifive thousand dollars to
et rid of a corruDt Judee? These
-
are some of the questions that vo
tfera must answer when we vote
.August 3 on a Constitutional Con
mention, . ' - .
If we win, the farmers, the in
dustrial workers, the professional
and 'business -men -"must .vote.
3either the railroads, the public
service corporations nor the polit
ical leaders of the State aTe help
line in the least. Nor have these
influential interests contributed
"one cent to the campaign. We
liave never had money .eiQough to
3ay printing, postage and clerical
l)ills.. We have not been able to
supply as much literature as we
2iave had calls for. -
The newspapers alone, daily and
weekly, have been alive to the great
meed of constitutional revision, and
Tthey have borne - the brunt of this
campaign, giving freely of their
pace and editorial support with
out a". cent of compensation. To
&hem all credit and honor is due.
.But farmers waul to see their
land -value enhance and have a
better market for, their produce;
laboring men want a better demand
for their labor; professional mVu
desire an increased demand - for
heir skill; business men want more
customers, 'and these things can
-only be when we amend our. Con
atitntion, revise our taxing system,
and make otir State morettraclive

tries. The August election is the
most important in fifty years.

RURAL CREDITS.
President Wilson July 17 signed
the rural credits bill passed by
Congress. A group of Senators
Representatives and " officers o
farmers' organizations applauded
warmly as Mr. Wilson affixed his
signature to the bill.
The unanimity with which Con
gress put through this measure and
the good roads bill pressages.the
same success for them that attend
ed the establishment of the new
banking and, currency system
The Washington Post says:
"When Germany put her rura
credits system into effect the per
centage of farmer tenants was
about as large as is the case in the
United States. Under the German
credit system, however, nearly- 90
per cent of the German farmers
now own their own land.
"With Federal aid to road con
struction and this new rural credits
law it should not be long before
the same - fortunate condition is
brought 1 about throughout the
United States."

Superintendent E. - J. Clement is

favor of the makers of Cardui, the

farms because they have no winter
cover crops can be overcome and
the soils improved if legumes are

ension, College of Acricultarel
Knoxville. Send to the divisioir if
