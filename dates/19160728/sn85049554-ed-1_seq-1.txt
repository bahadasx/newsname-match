SEA CAPTAIN EXECUTED
Commander of Brussels Shot to Death
by Germans.
Berlin, July £S.—Capt. Charles Kry
att, of the Great Eastern railway
steamship Brussels, which vessel was
captured by German destroyers last
month and taken into Zeebrugge, has
been executed by shooting, after trial.
The death sentence was passed upon
him because of his alleged action in
attempting to ram a German sub
marine.
Testimony was presented to show
thi while Captain Kryatt did not be
long to the armed fore's he had at
tempted, on March 28, 1915, while near
the Maas lightship, to ram the subma
rine U-33.
Captain Fryatt and the first officer
and the first engineer, of Brussels, re
ceived from the British admiralty gold
watches for "brave conduct."
The submarine U-33, according to
the official account of the trial, liad
signaled to the British steamer to ^how
her flag and stop but the captain did
not heed and is allegedvto have turned
at high speed toward the submarine.
Fear Reprisals by Allies.
Washington, July 28. Germany's
execution of Captain Fryatt, master of
the British steamship Brussels, for an
alleged attempt to ram a submarine, is
regarded in allied quarters here as a
brutual violation of international, law.
They contend that if a hostile subma
rine approached the Brussels it was' in
effect an attack and Captain Fryatt in
making a counter attack by attempting
to ram, subjected himself only to treat
ment as a prisoner of war In event of
capture.
Reprisals by the allies, it is feared,
must be followed by a change in the
German submarine policy, which ha*
been satisfactory to the United States
t«ince the last assurance that merchant
ships would not be attacked without
warning and promise of safety for pas
sengers and crew.

today from Ambassador Page the
British foreign office's statement of
willingness to permit importation of
food stuffs into Poland, provided the
occupying armies would not seize or
remove products of the occupied ter
ritory. The. condition it is feared, may
block negotiations.
Mr. Penfleld reported today that lie
delivered personally to Count yon
Burian on July'?8 President Wilson's
plteii In behalf of famine stricken Poles
and that the foreign minister promised
to deliver the president's plea to Fran
cis Joseph.

It is very heavy In weight and thick

unfortunately, there Is at present an

the heavy air arrives there It finds thero
is still lighter air over the continent.

It Is distributing this heat and humidity

MRS. MATTERS
GIVEN FREEDOM
Charges of FVoduolng-Apurfows Heir In
Order to Soour* Estate of Husband
Dismissed by State and Defendant's
Attorneys Say They Will
Not
As­
sist Mies Ryan'e Writ to Obtain
Possesion of Child.
Chicago, July 8,—Chargss of pro
ducing a spurious heir and perjury
against Mrs. .An da Do Hie iUedgervood
Matters wore dismissed In the state
court today. Charges grew out of the
rival claims of Mrs. Matters and (Marg
aret Ryan, a Canadian girl, to tho
motherhood of "Baby Irene," whom tho
former produced as an heir to tho es
tate of her late husband.
After the deolsion was announced tho
attorneys and principals went to tho
court of Federal District Judge Jbacdts,
who has heard evidence In a suit be
gun by Margaret Ryan to obtain po
sesslon of the child tihru a writ of
habeas corpus.. Mrs. Matters' attor
neys announced they would make no
defense.
Baby Irene, the central figure in tho
celebrated "Matters cue," will be re
stored to the Canadian girl, Margaret
Ryan, today was the Intimation of Fed
eral Judge Landis In court yesterday.
At the same time it was announced
by Assistant State's Attorney Daniel G.
Ramsey that the orlminal Indictments
against Mrs. Dollie Ledgerwood Mat
ters will either bo "burled" or nol
prossed.
These developments came shortly bo
fore the close of the aifternoon session
of Judge Landl* court in which testi
many was being heard In the habeas
corpus proceedings brought by Maiga
ret Ryan to obtain possession o£ Baby
Irene.
Asks Court to Reotore Baby.
When the last witness had been In
troduced by Attorney Francis Hlnokloy,
for Miss Ryan he asked tfoe oourt to
grant the plea and restore tho child to
the Canadian girl.
The witnesses had testlfled to their
participation In takin* Vbo baby Dram
the girl and ghrtn* It to Mm* Matter*
so she coufld put in a claim foMHtieer
share of her husband's estate.
Ing Attorney Btoekley** Blsa JTodgo
Landls said:
"1 can't make known ny deeHdon
now because It would hurt Itie. Bfat
ters In the criminal case wlhich
win bo
called next Monday. It would not bo
fair for the court to take any action
which would be adverse to any ono in
any criminal proceeding. I will bold
my decision in abeyance until the crim
inal action Is disposed of."
Will Never Come to Trial.
At this point Assistant State's Attor
ney Ramsey approached the bench and
said:
Your honor, it doeo not appear now
that the case can be heard In the crim
inal court before next autumn. By that
time all of tho witnesses will be back
In Canada and I cannot go into court
alone. The case Is set for Monday, but
it is very doubtful whether It can go to
trial and the expense of keeping tho
witnesses will be too much. It Is pos
sible that it never will come to trial."
All right, said the judge, "you go
over to Judge Thompson's court tomor
row and either nol-prosse the case or
take any other action the court deema
proper. Then come back here Imme
diately and I'll give my decision If the
reum
)a
rirnnnAri."
Satisfies Both 8ldea.
This arrangement was agreeable to
attorneys for both sides of tho case, and
Mrs. Matters appeared to be greatly re
lieved when she was told that further
prosecution poBslbly would be dropped.
Margaret Ryan, however, did not
quite understand what It was all about
and she began to cry. She had expect
ed that Baby Irene would be gtven to
her heforo tho afternoon was over. And
until her attorney encouraged her by
stating that she would have the baby
before noon tomorrow, she had bolleved
that the Judge Intended to allow Mra,
Matters to keop tho child.
That Mrs. Matters will relinquish all
claims to Baby Irene without further
court action, was the opinion expressed
by tho attorneys.
