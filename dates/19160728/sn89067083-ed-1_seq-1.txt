Williams A Winner.
From Democrat-Tribune.
Judfje Fred L. Williams ia
making; a splendid allowing In
Ills raoe for the Democratic
nomination fcr Judge of Division
No. 2 of the Supreme Court (un
expired term). This is not sur
prising to his many fiionda who
have known him and kept in
touch with hia oareer. h torn a
farmer boy, fn" early life, without
financial backing, he worked his
way through college .and law
school, comincr out tbe honor
man of his class. Upon finish
ing law eohool he located at Jup
lin, where by his own efforts he
arose to the lop of the Jasper
county bar. Three years and
half ago, when the Supreme
Court was looking over the State
for a man to appoint upon the
Supreme Court Commission- to
aid the court in writing opinions
and relieve the overcrowded con
dition of the Supreme Court
docket, Judge Williams was se
lected by the court from a list of
more than thirty applicants. So
satisfactorily did he perform his
work that he was again eleoted
by the unanimous vote of the
seven judges for another terra as
a commissioner. He is forty
years of age, stands six feet
three and ia as large mentally as
he is physically. He Is energetic
and has written hia full share of
opinions since he has been Bit
ing with Hie. Supreme Court.
He possesses a rare judicial tem
perament and a gret career is
predioted for him on the bench.
His only opponent is from the
Cily of St. Louis. That city al
ready has two out of tha seven
Supreme Judges, while Judge
Williams' section of th 3 State has
none. Williams is not running
against any of the present mem
bers of the Supreme Court.
We are of the opinion that the
Democratic vot?rs of the State
will enoounter little difficulty in
arriving at a choice in this raoe.

The secretary of stato compiles

ber of the printing commisson '

the paper used by the' state, and
has many duties for whioh a '
newspaper man'a knowledge and
experience are invaluable. And
then the unselfish-service nndoon
sietent Joyalty of the -country
editor to the interest of publio
and party alike makes him espe
cially worthy of preferment. For
those and other reasons the)
office of secretary of state has
been filled by newspaper men for
many years psit without a break,
Is there any reuson why the lime-
honored precedent should ba
disregarded this year? V
The only newspaper man run
ning is James Kelly Pool, for
twenty-five years owner and
editor of the Centralis Courier.
Nobody questions hia qualifica
tions; nobody challenges Ins
worthiness of tbe honor; nobody
doubts his long reoord of party
service and loyalty. He has the
