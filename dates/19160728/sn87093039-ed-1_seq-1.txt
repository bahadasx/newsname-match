TESHERA SUCCEEDS
POTTER AS MARSHAL
Council Concludes a Change Would Be
Beneficial—Salary Increased
$15 per Month
There being no quorum present on
Tuesday evening an adjourned meet
ing of council was held Wednesday
evening. Featherstoue, Miller Kugel
man, Seeley, Soyder and Woldenberg.
answered to the roll call. Hale was
the absentee.
Bills were allowed amounting to
$556.30. This includes the salaries
of the city employes, 8402.50.
A bill from Mr. Barnum for services
in Improvement District No. 4 was
laid over for investigation.
The clerk was authorized to purchase
the small frame building near the dam
from C. Warren Reid for a considera
tion of 870. It will be used for stor
ing the bedding and other articles used
in cases of contagious sickness.
The clerk was instructed to write
to Attorney Miller and request his
presence at the next regular meeting.
The council will consult him with re
gard to certain warrants which the state
bank request the payment of.
At this point in the proceedings a
little tilt occurred between Council
man Seeley and Mayor Day. Seeley
claimed the mayor spread a report that
there were two claims against him for
bootlegging and he resented the charge.
The mayor came back by saying that
he had heard from two or three sources
that one of the councilman was selling
booze and that he (Seeley) was the
one referred to. The matter was then
dropped.
Here the chief of police matter was
again brought up by the mayor, who
furnished additional evidence to show
Mr. Potter's lack of ability or desire to
enforce the law. According to the
mayor, John Kuly, an Austrian, told
him that he had been robbed in a
gambling game in Joe Violett's base
ment. He said he complained to
Marshal Potter and that instead of get
ting assistance he was advised to get
out of town and threatened with arrest.
He also said he told Pot»er that he had
a key to the basement and suggested
that the place be raided, but the idea
did not seem to appeal to the marshal.
After hearing the mayor's story and
and a statement from Potter, in which
he admitted most of the charges, tho
he differed somewhat in the details,
council thot it was about time to make
a change. A motion was made by
Kugelman and seconded by Snyder to
remove Mr. Potter from office. The
vote was as follows: Yea, Feather
stone, Kugelman, Miller and Snyder.
Nay, Seeley. Mr. Woldenburg was
not present when the vote was taken.
It was then moved to increase the
salary of the marshal from 875 to $90
per month. The vote stood as follows:
Yea, Featherstone, Kugelman, Seeley,
Snyder. Nay, Miller.
On motion which was carried unani
mously Joe Teshera was employed to
act as Chief of Police.
Mr. Geo. L. Gardner, of the Lamb-
Davis Lumber Co., thru Mayor Day
offered the use of teams for making
fills and repairs on the streets if trie
city will furnish the men. The offer
was accepted and a vote of thanks was
extended to Mr. Gardner.
The meeting was then adjourned.

HOME OF I. B. VIOLETTE
RAIDED WEDNESDAY LAST
Quantity of Liquor and a Gambling Out
fit Taken in Charge—Complaint
Filed—More to Follow
Under instructions from the mayor
and city attorney two special officers,
Jos. Teshera and J. F. Pratt made a
raid on the Violette home, near the
corner of Ninth and Commercial streets
Wednesday afternoon between the
hours of four and six o'clock, and found
32 bottles of beer and between 75
and a hundred bottles of whiskey, also
card tables, cards and a few poker
chips and some other paraphernalia,
loaded the outfit on a wagon and con
veyed it to the city hall and later stored
it in a room in the jail, where it will be
held pending the outcome of a charge
filed before Magistrate Graham against
Mr. Violette for selling liquor in viola
tion of the state dry law.
For some time the authorities have
suspected that Mr. Violette was selling
liquor in violation of the law, and com
plaint had also been made before Magis
trate Graham that a gambling game
was being conducted in the Violette
home. After sufficient evidence had
been secureu a raid was decided on.
Because City Marshal Potter was sus
pec'ed by the mayor, Magistrate and
city attorney, of being in collusion
with those who violated the law and
would not do his duty, special officers
were employed, and Jos. Teshera and
J. F. Pratt were sworn in.
The following inventory of stuff taken
from the Violette home in the raid has
been filed with Magistrate Graham:
Twelve gal. jugs empty, some with
small quantity of whiskey; four barrels
of empty beer and liquor bottles; two
packages of corks; one round gambling
table; two cases of empty pint whiskey
flasks; one gal. demijon in sack found
outside of house, broken and liquor
almost all gone, sack and ground satur
ated with whiskey; four chairs, five eye
shades, five packs of playing cards,
cigars, pipes, tobacco and matches;
32 pints of beer; 18 quarts of whiskey;
26 pints of whiskey, wrapped as if for
delivery; one quart French liquor; one
quart bottle bitters, not full, and one
pint bottle of whiskey not full. Part
of the above liquors were found out
side of and in front of the house where
Mr. Teshera says he saw Violette busy
carrying out something, and drop it on
the ground.
Nick Mike, a Greek track foreman
on the G. N. made complaint before
Magistrate Graham the first of this week
against J. B. Violette for selling him
two quarts of whiskey Sunday, July 23.
On his return from Wenatchee Wed
nesday afternoon, just before the raid
was pulled off, Violette was arrested by
Marshal Potter and went before Mapis
trate Graham and deposited $300 for
his appearance.
John Kuly made complaint Wednes
day night against Nick Mike and sev
eral other Greeks employed on track
work under Nick Mike for aggavated
assault in front of Mayor Day's place of
business, in which Kuly was roughly
handled. It appears from statements
made by Nick Mike and others that
John Kuly, an Austrian, who has been
employed on the snow shed work, but
has gambled and bought whiskey at
the Violette home, is responsible for
the big blow up which resulted in the 1
raid and the complaints about illegal
whiskey selling and gambling.
Nick Mike, the Greek with the
Americanized name, plead guilty to
assault before Magistrate Graham yes
terday evening and was fined 810 and
costs.
Forest Supervisor Sylvester tells the
Echo that with the exception of some
small and insignificant fires when small:

year.

KUMTUX CLUB MEETING
ON MONDAY AFTERNOON
Hears Interesting Report from Delegate
to State Federation
Meeting
The club met last Monday afternoon
at the home of Mrs. W. W. Wilder
with eighteen members in attendance.
Alter a short business session was held
and final arrangements were made for
the four numbers of the lyceum course
which the club expects to bring to
Leavenworth the coming winter, Mrs.
Charles Eckhart, who represented the
Kumtux Club at the Washington State
Federation of Women's Clubs, recently
held in Everett, made a report, touching
the most important matters discussed
at the state meeting. She stated that
such subjects as literature, music, and
art received consideration and were in
terestingly discussed from all angles.
Civic, as it touches the home, the wel
fare and health of children, sanitation
and home surroundings, was con
sidered the one question above all
others that possessed direct and imme
diate interest for women. It touches
her rights, her privileges and her duties
at so many points in the relation of
life under our government.
Mrs. Eckhart possesses the happy
faculty of reflecting both the serious
and humorous side of such questions
as came up for discussion in the con
vention.
WASHINGTON PROFESSOR
MAKtS GREAT DISCOVERY
Discovers New Way of Developing Tu
bercular Serum—May Lead to
Important Results
Lacking a specific cure for tubercu
losis, or a suitable prophylactic serum
for combating it, the recognition of
this disease in its early stages is of the
utmost importance. Researches, there
fore, in any manner facilitating the so
lution of this problem are looked upon
as of immense value.
That an important contribution in
this line has been made by Professor
C. A. Magoon, Bacteriologist of the
Washington Experiment Station at
Pullman, seems evident from the re
sults of his work just published in
geneal bulletin No. 132 cf the Exper
iment Station. As a result of these
observations, improved methods of cul
j tivation of the tubercle bacterium have
been worked out under such conditions
as seem to give promise for the per
fection of a reliable method for the
early diagnosis of the disease.
Professor Magoon's bulletin is merely
a preliminary report of his work which
is being continued along this line, and
while he makes no claim to having
solved the problem, there can be no
doubt that he has made a valuable
contribution in this connection.
Mr. and Mrs. J. B. Adams left here
last Sunday for Cle £lum and Ellens
burg by way of Blewett pass and had
for auto companions Senator 'and Mrs".
Ralph Nichols. From Ellensburg Mr.

Appendicitis—Was Buried in
Cashmere
The sudden and sad passing away
of Lyman Shotwell last Sunday morn
ing at 2:30 after undergoing an oper
ation for appendicitis, and rallying from

Leavenworth friends. For some time
he had been traveling for a Western
Avenue produce house, Cranston &
Bloxom, and had made this territory
for a number of years and made friends
of all he came in contact with. He

Gerhart was called from Wenatchee to
assist in the operation which was per
formed Friday. The doctors found
that he was suffering from the disease
in an advanced stage. The operation
howeve-, proved successful and he
seemed to rally from the shock. On
Saturday he was feeling better but Sun
day morning collapsed suddenly and
passed away. Mr. Shotwell was never
of a robust constitution and recently
complained of not feeling well and
thot he was suffering from a pulmonary
trouble. His general run down con
dition is said to be responsible for his
sudden death.
The remains were taken to Cashmere
Monday for burial. He was a son of
Jake Shotwell and a cousin of Mrs. H.
G. Krollpfeiffer.

ing of the scenery along the Blewett
pass Mr. Durbin said to an Arlington
reporter:
The scenery is simply grand, afford
iLg many thrills, as the car glides along
with one fender almost scraping the
bank, which is perpendicular on one
side, and the other fender apparently
sticking out over a precipice, making
one instinctively lean toward the bank
and hold his breath.
