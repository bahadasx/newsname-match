Joaeph P, MoCormloK Folls to Guln
Poaaoaalon of Ohild,
Early Sunday nftornoon conslderable
oxcltomont was cnuseil whcn Josoph I'.
McCormlck of New York, teachor of
mathomntics in tho Morris Hlgh Hchool,
nttempted to galn forciblo possossion of
his two-ycar-okl son, Tho child 'is in
tho cuatody of Its mother ljvlng nt tho
homoof her father, Jamos Hlncks, on
Seminary Htreot. Aa n proliminnry
to the nroceodings, Mr. McCormlck
drovo in an nutomobllo withln u few
rods of tho house, accompaniod by
Harry 0. Clnrk, his wifo, and slx-year
old son of Tarrytown, N. Y., whoro Mr,
Clark is mnnual.tralning tuachor in tho
Washington Irving High school,
Mr. McCormlck waa permitted to see
hlfl son in tho presenco of Olllcer George
Moore and twonunts of tho child. After
4ho child had bccn Inducod into n liall-
way a sccond time, and a second time
brought back to tho room by one of tho
aunts, tho ofllcer ordered tho door
closed. Immediately Mr. McCormlck
seized tho child, oponed tho door, and
without waiting to opon the scrccn
door which was fnstened, tore it open
and made a dash for tho car. Heforo
lu could reach the car. however, he was
overpowered by tho officer, who with
the nssistanco of othors, brought to the
sceno by the crics of the child nnd the
terrifying screnms of the mother, was
ablo to loosen the grasp whiie the
mother seized the child nnd ran to the
h0U3L'.
Failure on the part df Mr. McCormlck
to gain possession of the child, he, with
Mr. and Mrs. Clark, nccompanied by
Oflicor Moore. was taken to the resi-
dence of Attorncy LaFleur on Pleasant
street. Mrs. McCormick did not tic-
company them to the residence of Mr.
LaFleur, as stuted.
December, 1914, Mrs. McCormick
filed a pctition forseparate maintenance
and the custody of the child on the
grounds of intoTerable severity and non
support. December 29, of the same
year, at a preliminiiry hearing the
mother was given the custody of the
child and two dollars a week toward his
support, which continued uiuil Decem
ber, 1915, when the case was dismissed
by the county court. This is the only
support Mr. McCormick has given the
mother or child since July 30, 1914.
D. A. R. MEETING.
At a recent special meeting of Mary
Baker Allen Chapter, D. A. R., it was
decided to tnke np the work outlined
by the Red Cross society and material
beingsecured each lady was requested
to bring her thimble, needle, and scis
sors to the meeting on July 22. Twenty
four members and eight guests were in
attendanee and much interest was
manifested in the work, for which one
afternoon each week was appointed,
and the invitation was extended to all
ladies interested. Mrs. Parline, a non
resident New York member, who was
present, told of the work in Westches
ter County and Miss Trask, a Wellesley
student, told what they did at Wellesley.
Miss Sanford described the "comfort
bag," and Mrs. A. J. Field the small
pillows so much used in hospitals. At
thecloseof a bricf business meeting
Mrs. Lane read a very interesting
letter dated "Cavalry Corps Hospital,
City Point, Va., September 11, 1SG4,"
written by George S. Gale, Surgeon in
the 1st Vermont Cavalry. The letter
was an inspiration to patriotism and
while the writer evidently preferred
peace to war, he would face war rather
than sacrifice the honor of the Nation
and the principles for which our ances
tors fought and died. A fine paper on
Colonial life in Virginia was written and
read by Mrs. K. H. Taylor. A dainty
luncheon was served by the committee
in charge and the meeting adjourned.
