Kalispell To
Have Round-up
The modern, up-to-date
Round-Up is one of the most
fascinating and popular shows
offered to the public.
Kalispell, Montana, has enter
ed the list of enterprising towns
in the Northwest that is offer
ing such an attraction to the
people. The purses and prizes
aggregating thousands of dollars
will attract some of the finest
array of talent that has entered
the arena of a wild west show.
The Kalispell attraction will
consist of a day show held on
the County Fair Grounds, and
a night show illustrating the
early day:; of the old frontier
town of Demersville, Montana.
Demersville was the one typical
frontier town a quarter of a
century ago, located on the
Flathead River and was the
distributing point for the Great
Northern during its construc
tion through the Rocky Moun
tains. It was the resort for the
worst characters, as well as the
home of some of the best
and bravest people on earth.
Many of the frontier scenes
occurances of those early days
will be acted by western men
who lived in the old town.
The big day shows for three
days, August 16, 17, and 18,
will be one of biggest wild
west features ever staged in the
Northwest.
Already the best show con
testants with strings of
thoroughbred race horses are
arriving getting ready for the
big relay races. Programs of
Round-Up have been mailed to
250 contestants throughout the
entire Northwest and South.
The program is large and varied
and the purses and prizes large
enough to invite the best taler.t

The State Fair
Al! railrord; optrati ig in
Montana are co-operating with
the management of the Mon
tana State Fair and Exposition
to the extent that it will be
possible for anyone living in
any section of the state to visit
Helena duriny the 1910 fair at
just half the expense that is
"W hile
the union
state on the cheap
events
in no other state in
are such low rates
enjoved, the announcement
that all railroads of this state
would reduce their rates one
half for the coming exposition
did not suprise those in charge
of the fair, as the railroad
companies have had the half
fare policy in force for years.
Special trains wiil run into
Heiena from many points in the
state during fair week, in ad
dition to the iiiU^r tuir
service, so that it will be con
venient as well as economical
for every resident of Montana
to visit "The Faix that educates."
Tickets at the reduced rates
may be had been between
September 23 and 30th, and will
be good returning until October
2nd. As the fair will be held
during the week of September
25th to 30th, it will be possible
to come from any point in the
tickets in
time for the opening attraction
and there will be plenty of time
to return after the closing
The first call over the trans
continental telephone line to go
through Cut Bank occured last
Tuesday morning, when a party
in New York City called
Glacier National Park, the
message going through the local
exchange. Manager Bomboy
says that the transmission was
perfect, and that he could hear
both the Salt Lake and New
York operators as plainly as if
they were here in town.
Opening of Blackfeet
The proposal for opening
part of the Blackfeet Indian
Reservation to settlement is
now in committee of the house
and the report of the Indian
office on it is being written up
said ' a letter received by the
commercial club this morning
from Congressman John M.
Evans.
This was the subject of a
recent meeting of the commer
cial club with representatives
of Cut Bank, which is seeking
the opening of the reserve and
j the transfer of its jurisdiction
f om the Kalispell land offiefe
to the Great Falls office. The
commercial club then pleged
itself to the proposal.
Mr. Evans wrote that the
house will not consider the
bill without the departmental
report.
"Rest assured," he wrote,
"that we will keep after this
until we get action, and the
sooner, the better."— Tribun 3.
RAILROAD
WAGES
Shall they be determined by
Industrial Warfare or
Federal Inquiry?
To the American Public:
Do you believe in arbitration or indus
trial warfare?
The train employes on all the railroads
are voting whether they will give their leaders
authority to tie up the commerce of the
country to enforce their demands for a 100
million dollar wage increase.
The railroads are in the public service—
your service. This army of employes is in
the public service—your service.
You pay for rail transportation 3 billion
dollars a year, and 44 cents out of every
dollar from you goes to the employes.
On all the Western railroads in 1915, seventy-five per cent of the
train employes earned these wages (lowest, highest and average
of all) as shown by the pay rolls—

The average yearly wage payments to all Western train em
ployes (including those who worked only part of the year) as
shown by the 1915 payrolls were—
Passenger Freight Yard
Engineers $2038 $1737 $1218
Conductors 1772 1624 1292
Firemen 1218 973 832
Brakemen 921 1000 1026
A 100 million dollar wage increase for
men in freight and yard service (less than
one-fifth of all employes) is equal to a 5 per
cent advance in all freight rates.
The managers of the railroads, as trustees
for the public, have no right to place this
burden on the cost of transportation to you
without a clear mandate from a public tri
bunal speaking for you.
The railroads have proposed the settle
ment of this controversy either under the
existing national arbitration law, or by refer
ence to the Interstate Commerce Commis
sion. This offer has been refused by the
employes' representatives.
Shall a nation-wide strike or an
investigation under the Gov
ernment determine this issue?

Parents Mourn
On Friday, July 21st., Pearl
Mildred, the four year-old
daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Henry
Ohlinger was buried in Crown
Hill Cemetery. The little one
was attacked by diabetes, and
after a brief illness, it proved
fatal. The funeral service was
conducted by Rev. Alexander
Pringle of the Presbyterian
church. A choir consisting of
Mrs. Worden, Mrs. Taft and
Mrs. Ksenholts sang "The
Sweet Story of Old" and other
appropriate music. The be
reaved familv have the sym
i pathy of the entire community.
Postal Savings
Larger postal savings deposits
will now be accepted at the
post office. This is made
possible by an important
amendment to the Postal
Savings Act just approved by
President Wilson. A postal
savings depositor may now
have an account amounting to
$1,000 upon which interest will
be paid. Formerly $500 was
the maximum amount he could
have to his credit. This en
largement of postal savings
facilities will be very gratifying
to thousands of depositors who
have already reached the old
$500 limits and are anxious to
entrust more of their savings
to Uncle Sam. Another feature
of the amendment that will
avoid further embarrassment to
the public and to postal officials
is the doing away with the
limit on the amount that could
accepted from a depositor
monthly. Under the old law
only $100 could be deposited
in a calendar month. The
amendment abolishes this re
striction, While the Postal
j Savings System has already
proved a signal success as is
! shown by the fact that more
I than half-a-million depositors
have over eighty million dollars
standing to their credit, still it
has fallen short of meeting the
full demands of the public
because of the restrictions
which have now been elimi
nated. Postmaster General
Burleson and Third Assistant
Postmaster General Dockery
have Lten timeless in then
efforts to secure a modification
of the limitations and the new
liberalizing legislation is
particularly gratifying to them.
