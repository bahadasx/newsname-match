EXECUTION
OF FRYATT
Brutal Violation of Inter
national Law, Say Ally
Authorities.
RETALIATION LIKELY
United States Is Irterostod
to Extent Submiirinb
Warfare Involved.
Washington, July 2S. Germany's
execution of Captain Charles Fryatt,
master of the British steamship Brus
sels, far an alleged attempt to ram a
submarine, is regarded in allied quar
ters here as a brutal violation of in
ternational law, likely to result in
prompt retaliatory measures by Great
Britain. They contend that if a hostile
submarine approached the Brussels it
was in effect an attack and Captain
Fryatt. in making a counter attack by
attempting to ram, subjected himself
only to treatment as a prisoner of war
In event of capture.
United .States Interested.
The United States government is in
terested in the incident and what may
follow it, particularly because of the
bearing it may have upon the difficult
problems involved in submarine war
fare, which in the. past have brought
the country to the brink of war, be
cause it is charged with the care of
interests of prisoners on both sides.
Reprisals by the allies, it is feared,
might be followed by a change in the
German submarine policy.
Authorities on international law1
agree that the justice or injustice of
the shooting of Captain Fryatt depends
entirely upon the circumstances under
which he headed his vessel for tne
submarine. If the submarine attack
ed or was about to attack him, he had
the right to counter attack; if he was
seeking out an enemy vessel for at
tack, he placed himself in the class of
a criminal subject to summary execu
tion upon capture.
Rule By The Hatrue.
Convention .'o. 10 of the second
Hague peace conference sets forth
how the crews of merchantmen who
legitimately resist capture shall be
treated as part of the armed forces of
an enemy. The investigation has been
clouded "by the belligerents' charges
and counter charges concerning the
conduct of submarine warfare and the
allied efforts to exterminate the Ger
man -submarines. Germany claims
British merchant ships have orders
from the admiralty to ram any enemy
submarines sighted and that the mas
ters of ships -carrying out such orders
are pirates.
Oihcials here point out that the
I'nited States has taken the position
that the master of any merchant ves
sel wlj sees a submarine approach
ing had from the very nature of the
submarine method of warfare the
right to presume that he is about to be
attacked. Consequently, it is argued,
he has the right to forestall that at
tack by himself ramming or firing to
defend himself.
Attempted to Ram.
Berlin, July 2S, (by wireless to Say
ville.i. Captain Charles Fryatt of the
Great Eastern Railway steamship
Brussels, which vessel was captured
by German destroyers last Month and
taken into Zeebrugge, has been exe
cuted by shooting, after trial before a
German naval court martial. The
death sentence was passed upon Cap
lain Fryatt because of his alleged ac
tion in attempting previously to ram
b German submarine.
Teb'irnony ws.s presented at the
court martial to dhow that while Cap
tain Fryatt did not belong to the armed
forcea, "he had attempted on March 28,
3S15, while near the Maas light ship to

The trial was held at Bruges, Bel

LL TRIED
(liarsred "With Attempting to Gain Ad
mission to Knutsford Barracks
Cannot Talk to Prisoners.
London, July 28. Speeches which
he had made to prisoners, describing
them as martyrs, and demonstrations
held by the prisoners when he visited
them, were given as the reasons by the
crown attorney why Laurence Ginnell,
Irish nationalist member of parlia
ment for North Westnieath, had been
refused permission to visit Irish pris
oners in England, when hearing of the
charge against him of attempting to
gain admission into the KnuUsford bar
racks was resumed in the Bow street
police court today.
The crown attorney said that when
Ginnell visited the Irish prisoners at
Stafford, he told them they had done
more for the Irish cause than anybody
else, and that they were looked upon
as martyrs.
On a similar visit to the prison at
Wadsworth there was a disturbance
among the prisoners who carried Gin
nell around on their shoulders. After
this incident an order was issued re
fusing Ginnell permission to visit any
places where Irish prisoners were de
tained and he was arrested when he
tried to gain admission at Knutsford
barracks under the name "of Lebries
McFingle.
Mr. Ginnell was fined 100 pounds
sterling.
Laurence Ginnell was arrested at
the detention barracks at Knutsford
on July 15. On being arraigned he
protested to the magistrate against his
arrest, saying there was no case
against him. The name McFingle, he
asserted, was Irish for Ginnell and the
whole incident could easily be ex
plained. He was remanded for trial
and released under bond.
Mr. Ginnell yesterday caused a short
suspension of "the sitting in the house
of commons, when he refused to with
draw when ordered to do so by the
speaker.

Morale of German Troops
Is Not Affected by On
slaught on East Front.
GOOD FOOD FOR ARMY
Rations Are Sufficient for
men No Anti-American
Feeling Found.
j With the Germany Arrry on the Riga
i Front, July 25, (by courier to Berlin,
j via Ixmdon, July 2S). Russian efforts
! to break the German lines at various
points on this front, which the Asso
ciated Press correspondent has in
spected personally in the last few days,
have neither affected the front nor
what is perhaps equally important
the morale of the German troops.
The correspondent has viewed the
great sectors of the front from south
of Kekkau to a point well south of
Friedrichstadt, has stood in the
trenches amid the devastation of drum
fire of but few hours before and has
talked freely with the men engaged.
He has also mingled unconcernedly
with the troops behind the front and
has endeavored in every way possible
to find some indication of a falling off
in the morale of the fighting spirit
At one barracks the commander said
to the soldiers:
"Here is an American newspaper
correspondent. Tell him all he wants.
I am leaving him here alone and shall
not try to find out what questions he
asks nor what you told him."
The commander and all other ofR
cers then left the barracks and the
soldiers answered every question with
ttttiwOrSffSess:-.'
Tne correspondent, who had been
cautioned that he was likely to fintj
much anti-American feeling among the
troops, put questions designed to dis
cover if such sentiment existed. The
men said they knew nothing of the ex
istence of such a feeling. One soldier
summed up their attitude as follows:
"Some American ammunition is be
ing used here, but that is a political
question. And we don't know, much
about it. We don't hate anybody. We
don't hate the Russians. It is war and
we are here to fight and we are going
to keen risrht on tishtinc -until the ene
my has had enough, whether it lasts j
one year or ten."
Soldiers Well Fed.
The men were well clothed and
plainly well fed. The day previously
the correspondent inspected a division
commissariat and obtained from the
quartermaster a list of the rations. In
quiries among the men confirmed this
list in every detail. The daily ration
follows:
Bread, (unmixed with potato flour),
750 grammes; meat, 250 grammes;
groats, 125 grammes; butter, f5
grammes; coffee, 25 grammes; salt, 25
grammes; tea, three grammes; sugar,
17 grammes; cheese, 25 grammes;
wheat flour, 25 grammes. There are
two meatless dcys weekly, on one fish
is substituted and on the other stewed
fruits with rice. When the water in
the trenches is bad the tea and sugar
rations are doubled. Two cigars and
two cigaret-3 are issued daily to each
man. In addition every battalion has
its own canteen whore cakes and
canned fruits, etc., can be bought.
Reduce Broad Rations Only.
The soldiers were openly amused
when informed it had been reported
abroail that their rations had been cut
down ari' that they were often forced
to go hungry." The only ration reduced
is that of bread aud this reduction was
made losg ago because it was found
that the men were unable to eat more
than the quantity now allowed. Thia
ration compares with 270 gTammes
daily allowed civilians in Berlin. The
daily meat ration for the soldiers
equals the weekly allowance in Ber
lin and the butter allowance is more
than quadruple that in the capital. Ra
tions in other things are in the same
proportion.

New York, July 28. The national
organiaztoin of the street railway em
ployes today continued efforts to un
ionize all the morormen and conduct
ors of New York City. Its leaders pre
dicted that if the street railway com
pany did not yield to their demands in
the Bronx and Westchester county, the
strike in those districts would spread
throughout the city. Officers of the
carmen's organization said that a fund
of $750,000 was on hand for use in the
event of a general tieup on subway,
surface and elevated lines in New
Vork.

in
Chicago, July 23. Workmen in the
rolling mills of the Republic Iron and
Steel company in East Chicago and the
Interstate Iron and Steel company in
South Chicago, refused to go to work
because of the intense heat today, and
as a result both mills were closed un
til the hot weather is over. The men
participating in the protest numbered
2,199. It is expected that employes of
other mills will also protest. Tem
peratures taken in the rolling mills a
few days ago ranged from 140 to 160
degrees.
Pleasure of Relief.
Fitful breezes from. Chicago gave
Chicago and other lake cities a meas
ure of relief today, the temperature at
noon being 95, a few degrees under
yesterday's mark at that hour. How
ever, the winds are variable, and it
was explained at the government
weather bureau that the shifting of the
wind to the plains would cause a quick
rise to 100 degrees or more. The lake
water is becoming heated and the lake
winds do not afford the relief they did
a few days ago.
Deaths from the heat are increasing
in number, 25 being re ported t the po
lice this morning. The number of heat
prostrations also is increasing rapidl?
and hospital authorities declare that
the recovery of patients is retarded
and often prevented by the intense
heat.
The weather forecaster still looked
in vain to the northwest for signs of
relief and declared that every indica
tion pointed to a continuance of the
present weather conditions.

Deutschland would not sail until offi

by the statement of Captain Koenig

It was said the Deutschland would

Washington, July 23. Increases of

interstate commerce commission. It is
estimated the increases will add about
$520,000 yearly to the revenues of the
carriers. The railroads contended that
under the old rates bituminous coal
did not bear its proper proportion of
operation cost nor yield a fair return
on the railroad investment.

Washington, July 28. Informal as

trian forces have been given person
ally by Foreign Minister Burian to Am

The state department also received
today from Ambassador Page, the Brit
ish foreign office's statement of Great
Britain's willingness to permit impor
tation of foodstuffs into Poland to be
administered by a commission ap
pointed by President Wilson, provided
the German and Austrian occupying
armies would not seize or remove pro
ducts of the occupied territory. The
condition, it is feared, may block ne
gotiations. Mr. Penfield reported oday that he
delivered personally to Count von
Burian on July 23 President Wilson's
plea in behalf of famine stricken Poles
and that the foreign minister promised
to deliver the president's communica
tion immediately to Emperor Francis
Joseph. The minister's unofficial opin
ion was that the request would be met
by Austria and Germany.
Ambassador Penfield was told by the
foreign minister that Austria was ad
ministering affairs in one-third of Rus
sian Poland and that famine conditions
there have been greatly ameliorated in
recent months by good crops and man
agement. State department officials regard the
reception of the president's letter at
the Austrian foreign office an a hope
ful sign of concessions which will
eventually permit American relief
measures Jor. LUfrtaxrinPoleA.
