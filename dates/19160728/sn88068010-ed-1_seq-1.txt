Speaker Champ Clark and Ma-
jority House Leader Claude
Kitchin Highly Endorse
Rucker.
The following letters were
handed us this morning and
show conclusively that there are"
few men in congress who have
accomplished more than Con
gressman Rucker:
Committee on Ways and Means,
House of Representatives,
Washington, D. C, July 15,
1916.
Mr. J. W. McNinch,
Moberly, Missouri.
My Dear Sir;
Replying to your letter of July
13th, I beg to say that Congress
- man W. W. Rucker is one of the
strong, influential members of
the house. His record in con
gress is that of a loyal, diligent,
able, wise and patriotic democrat
and legislator. He has been a
most helpful and efficient sup
porter of the big program of
constructive legislation of the
Wilson administration and the
democratic congress, .embracing
the tariff revenue act, federal
reserve act, federal trade com
mission, anti-trust act, rural
credits, warehouse and cotton
futures acts, agricultural exten
sion work, Phillipine bill, the
conservation bills, army and
navy bills, corrupt practices act,
etc, etc.
As their author, the party and
the country are indebted more to
Congressman Rucker than io any
other man for the constitutional
amendment providing for the
election of senators by ..the Dec
'le-andttbfthrcoptlrectices
act, two of the big measures
which commend the party to the
approval of the people.
He is regarded by the house
as one of the ablest, wisest, and
most patriotic legislators.
With assurances of my best
wishes, I beg to remain,
Sincerely yours,
CLAUDE KITCHIN.
The Speaker's Room, House of
Representatives, Washington,
D. C, July 15, 1816.
Dr. S. P. Towles,
, Moberly, Missouri.
My Dear Doctor:
I have your letter inquiring in
to the standing of Judge W. . W.
nucKer in tne nouse. He is
chairman of one of the biggest
committees of the house of repre
sentatives and has been for six
years, or. three congresses,
which would seem to be a suffi
cient answer as to his standing,
Men do not get to be chairman
of big committees in the house
of -representatives unless they
are able men and good
workmen. He is the author
of several very important bills
and is at this very minute on
the floor of the house piloting
through a bill which is intended
to break up the use of money in
politics. , That is, the corrupt
and unnecessary use. He is uni
versally regarded as a first rate
representative. ,.
Yours very truly, :
V , CHAMP CLARK

your ears open.
Gardner at Brunswick
On his way from Kansas City
to Fayette Col. F. D. Gardner,
leading candidate for gover
nor stopped off at Brunswick
and for nearly an hour Wednes
day night addressed a very large
crowd considering that the notice
of his coming was so short. He
left Brunswick for Fayette, stop
ping over night at Salisbury and
meeting many citizens and far
mers of the neighborhood.
There were nearly a hundred
automobiles lined up at the de
put at Brunswick to meet the
popular candidate, and the Gard
ner Club had the band out and
nearly all its members.
President Bowman of the club
introduced the speaker and the
the Secretary. Arthur Wallace
had number one arrangements
perfected for the occasion. To
Mr. Wallace is due in large meas
ure the organization of the club
and general boosting for Col.
Gardner. The illness of Col.
Gardners wife disarranged all
his campaign plans for the last
two weeks, and what with con
stant attention to her and after
her departure for California do
ing his best night and day to fill
some of his broken dates, the
man is pretty well worn out, but
his speech at Brunswick was
given the closest attention and
was all that could be desired.
His explanation of the
bank bill which bears his name
was convincing, and when he
said to the large crowd that if
the democratic party of the state
felt that there was another
among the candidates for gover
nor who could best serve the in
terest f the people and party.
he was more than willing-that
that man should receive the nom-
fhnttfonliie was" most 'appreciat
ed. : .
To Voters.
From information that has come
to me, I believe that a last hour
political campaign in the Sheriff's
race is to be made through the
newspapers this week. As this is
the last isue of the papers before
the primary, I desire to say that
I have made a clean campaign
for this nomination. I 'have not
engaged in mud slinging, and
will not engage in it. I have
made the campaign upon the
facts and the truth, believing
that I can be of service to the
people of the county. I sincere
ly ask your- support and that
you do not be misled by articles
put out on the eve of the elec
tion. A. S. Wilks.

Sterling Ewing Escapes Being
Injured. Backed Into Auto
mobile. Killed To Relieve :
As Sterling P. Ewing, candi
date for sheriff was returning to
town from the Mike neighbor
hood Monday evening the horse
he was ridine became frighten
ed at on automobiie driven by
Frank Sanders of Oklahoma,
near Mike. In a narrow road
west of Mike the horse wheeled
around in front of the car and
in addition to having a leg brok
en, was so badly scarred other
wise that it was necessary to
shoot the horse to put it out of
prolonged agony. Mr. Ewing
was not hurt. No blame is
attached to the driver of the
car as the accident could not
have been prevented.
A Statement
I feel that my affairs are a
matter of liltle concern to the
voters of Chariton County and I
hesitate to intrude upon their
notice in this way, but I feel
that a simple statement of facts
should be made since Mr. Roy
McKittrick has seen fit to attack
me from the platform. I under
stand from what I consider a
reliable source, that Mr. McKitt
rick in bis speeches at Brunswick
and other parts of the county
made statements to this effect
that some time in 1914 I trans
fered money that I had in the
Salisbury bank to the Glasgow
Saving bank for the purpose of
evading taxes. This statement,
if made by Mr. Kittrick, is abso
lutely untrue jind he knows it
t did not move one' dollar ""from
Salisbury to Glasgow or any
where else, and the bank record
will show it He also said, 1 un
derstand, that I sent money to
another state for the purpose of
evading taxes. This also is false
and Mr. McKittrick knows it is
false. If any one cares enough
about this matter to investigate
1 ask that information be ob
tained from banks in ques
tion and that no one be im
posed upon by . the false state
ments I understand Mr. Mc Kit
trick has been making.
Very truly,
26 Edward H. Hamilton.
Judge Rucker will be the next
congressman from this district
and a few who are fighting his
nomination will benefit by the
office remaining in the county,
little as they deserve to.

Loziers Campaign
Hon. Ralph Lozier, candidate
for congress and the fourth vic
tory of Whitecotten, has made
a canvas of this county by speech
making as he ha3 of each of the
Other counties in the second dis
trict. The speeches, carefully
prepared and rehearsed until he
has them letter and jesture per
fect, or rather the speech, for
he has but the one and it is the
same he started with except in
the particular of the Hale epi-
SorJ.'. The story that he supported
C"! Hale against the nominee
of Tin? democrats of this district,
was lirst told about a month ago
in a letter from one of the old
friends of the Lozier family to
the Paris Mercury. The father
of Mr. Lozier's campaign mana
ger, Mr. Conklin, the author of
the letter, adheres to his asser
tion and the son. Newlan Conk
lin, says it is not true. Ralph
tozier states everwhere that he
cjid not vote for Col. Hale, but
no where that we have heard
hjn; speak has he ever denied
tjiat he supported Hale, the reas
on given by him for not voting
being that he was not old
enough to vote, and in proof
oj that claim, he carries
with him all his life insur
ance policies and a copy of the
record in an old family bible
which ha3 been destroyed, the
date of his admission to the bar
and a 42 minute address, all the
data being prepared by Lozier
himself. The speech is divided,
first about ten minutes being de
voted to the war and other ex
traneous subjects, 40 minutes to
hfs spotless life 45 minutes to
establishing his democracy and
30 minutes to repeating ' that
K; opponent has held office for
thirty years and it is Loziers
time to get in and hang on as
long as he can. The matter of
the twelve years which Rucker
is charged with for being prose
cuting attorney and circuit judge
together with the next two years
in congress, goes to make up the
thirty year record to which Loz
ier has objected to for the first
time. Just why Mr. Lozier feels
privileged to reflect on the dem
ocratic voters of this county for
electing judge Rucker to a coun
ty office any number of times the
party wished him to serve, or
why he centures the democracy
of the congressional district for
naming the judge so often to
represent it when he himself has
been a party to the awful thing
as ne pretends to regard it now,
is apparent.
No where or at any time has
Ralph Lozier said a word in com
mendation of President Wilson,
intimated that he a supporter of
the adminstration or in the faint
est way given the people he has
addressed to understand what he
would have done that judge
Rucker has not done or not have
done what Judge Rucker has
done. If Lozier should win, he
would go to congress without a
single pledge concerning what
he stands for. He would be at
liberty to support or oppose any
measure which President Wilson
or the democrats in congress put
forth. He has uttered not a sin
gle word in his speech which
commits him to anything. Why
does he not say and let the peo
ple he expects to vote for him,
know where stands? Has he
something up his sleeve which
would kill his chances every
where if he exhibited it to the
people? It is the first time in
the history of this district that
any man has gone before the
people and asked them to make
him one of the lawmakers, for
the nation unpledged to anything.
If he should be elected it will be
the first time in the history of
the country that a man has been
sent to act as he pleased after

Under the leadership of repub
lican boss of Sullivan county,
Lenny Baldridge, there were
three cars of Sullivan county
Swanger boosters in town Wed
nesday. They had made the
rounds of the western r art of
tne district and were on their
way home. Hon F. C. Sasse
piloted the boosters from Bruns
wick to this city and introduced
the only .speaker, prosecuting
attorney Painter of Sullivan'
county who said that he was
sure that Swanger would benom
nated and in a lower voice that
he would be elected.
Hon. Jno. E. was not along a3
advertised he would be, but then
candidates for all state offices
got their wires crossed during
the past week. Nothing doing
for Mr. Swanger down this way.
Judge Lamm is the man for the
nomination and he will get it and
then get the fixins put on himself
proper.
he got to Washington. It is too
late to regulate him after he is
elected and Mr. Lozier should
outline some of his views on na
tional questions before he makes
a request for votes. Leaving
out of the argument the presum
tion Lozier exhibits in coming to
this county and asking voters to
pass over to him an office held so
honorably by one of our citizens
without offering some excuse
better than merely wanting our
man put out to let him in, there
there is good ground for viewing
his aspiration with considerable
suspicion. Yes, suspicion, for he
is groomed and directed and we
behve, controlled by Jim White
cotten who is in evidence in this
county in various forms, backing
the Lozier campaign-Why? No
denial of Whitecotten. s right to
swarm about over the . district
in the interest of whom he desir
es to support but when he has
been at it for years and is still
active against Rucker in favor of
any one he can persuade to run,
we reiterate, suspicion is well
placed. Mr. Loziers entry into
the the race was at the instance
of Whitecotten and a few who
wanted post offices they could
not pretend to fill properly and
so did not get them. The ac
tive ones against Rucker in this
county and there are few, must
surely expect to get from Lozier
what Judge Rucker refused.
Otherwise, why the sacrifice of
time and treath against the dis
tinguished home candidate?
Judge Rucker has been most
careful to recomend no one for
public place who was not com
petent If some of those he re
fused to reccomend are to be fav
ored by Lozier because of their
support, in several places in the
district as well as in this county
the public service will get its
fh st backset in j ears. Is it ani
mosity against Rucker or hope
of getting a salary as figurehead
in some appointive office that is
actuating some of the vicious
electioneering against him? So
far as local aspirants for tne place
Judge holds are concerned, they
or there may be but one, may
feel that it would be better to
defeat the judge with some man
outside the county, having no
chance whatever against him in
this county, but will still assist
the district in taking care of it
self and permit no political
calamity.

To Voters of Chariton County:
If I have been denied the op
portunity of seeing you during
my canvass for Representative
of this County, I want you to
know that this failure to do so is
the result of conditions over
which I had no power.
I dare say there is not a candi
date in this campaign who will
see all the voters. In the num
ber of unseen voters will be some
of my oldest and best friends.
As the rest of my time will be
taken up in speaking, I will not
be able to give more time to the
individual voter.
I believe it is peculiarly desir
able that the position of candi
dates for law making offices be
known to the people, and to that
end will say that I shall, if elect
ed, vote for no bill which would
take away from the people the
right to pass on any question:
that I favor convict labor on the
public roads: that I believe that
navigation of the great Missouri
river should be encouraged in
every possible way: that corpora
tions should be regulated both
with referance to a fair return on
the Capital invested and the inter
ests of the public: that extrav
agant expenditures should be
discontinued and therevenueshow
a surplus without increase of tax
ation instead of a shortage. Let
my opponents enlighten voters on
what they have as an excuse for
asking for the nomination at the
hand3 of the democrats of this
county. That I could,
not see and tell you your
consideration and support are
desired and valued, is my only
regret.
Very respectfully yours

Denial of False Reports.
When my late husband, P. R.
O'Brian died in the fall of 1914
the county committee placed
Robert Hurt's name on the ticket
to fill out the unexpired term.
When he became sheriff he en
tered into an agreement with me
that he would deduct $35.00 per
month from the earnings of the
office as his salary and pay the
balance of the fees collected over
to me to meet the obligations of
my husband. This agreement
had been suggested at the time the
committee appointed him. Just
on the eve of the primary elec
tion word has come to me that
some persons, evidently desirous
of injuring the candidacy of
Robert Hurt are circulating the
report that he has collected
and kept all the fees of sheriff's
office during the time that he
has served.
I am sure that this story is be
ing circulated maliciously and I am
writing this letter that the dem
ocratic voters of Chariton county
may know that this story is ab
solute untrue and to say that
Robert Hurt has dealt fairly with
me in every particular. Every
dollar that has been earned by
the sheriff's office had been paid
over to me as soon as it was col
lected and I have paid Robert a
salary of $35.00 per month as
was the original agreement
I trust that the voters of this
county will not be influenced by
the wickedly false report that is
being circulated to the contrary.
