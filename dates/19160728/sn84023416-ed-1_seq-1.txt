ISLAND POND NATIONAL BANK
For Auditor of Accounts
7o tht Voters of Vermont:
I am a candidate for the ollice of Auditor of Accounts,
and I hope I may have your support at the September pri
mary. For the past four years 1 have been the assistant in the
oilice of the State Treasurer, which otlice, as you know, in
terlocks with that of the Auditor of Accounts, and I am
warranted in stating that upon the Auditor devolve active,
varied and responsible duties. The general provisions of
the law involve a multiplicity of details in accounting, run
ning' into thousands of items annually and f iese duties are
not easily undertaken by one whose work and experience
have not been along similar lines.
I am 40 years old, was educated in the public schools of
Vermont, and tirst served an apprenticesshih at the printer's
trade in my father's office. Then came 20 years devoted to
business adminstration, the latter half of this time being
given to banking. Five years of this period I was cashier
of the National Bank of Barre. The past four years I have
been the assistant State Treasurer, holding the place at the
present time. 1 have servt d as auditor of the city of Barre,
was auditor of the Granite Mutual Insurance Company,
have been a director in the National Bank of Barre, the
Quarry Savings Bank and Trust Company and the (Jranite
Mutual Insurance Company, both of (Jarre.
I was representative from the city of Barre in the Leg
islature of 1910 and served as chairman of the committee
on banks, also being a member of the committee on manu
factures. I go before you, voters of the state, on my record of
service in lines that should fit me to fill the ollice of aud
itor satisfactorily to all.

Death of Archie Turgeon.
Our village was thrown into a
state of excitement and sorrow Sun
day at about 4:30 p.m., when it was
learned that Archie Turgeon, one of
Island Pond's brightest young men,
had lost his life while bathing in the.
lake. It appears that he and one of
his companions, Earl Norris, had been
out canoeing, and after coming
ashore decided to go in bathing near
the boat house at Brown Basin.
They had been in the water about 30
minutes when they started towards
shore, and when nearing same Earl
looked to see if Archie had reached
shore; as he was not in sight he
asked several boys on shore if they
had seen him; they replied they had
not. He then became alarmed, and
found all the assistance he could; all
the available boats were put into
service, grappling hooks procured,
and the townspeople worked un
ceasingly until far into the night,
but no trace of the body could be
found. Search was again resumed
early Monday morning, and at about
10 a.m. the body was found in abmt
15 feet of water. An exam;nati ion
was made and no definite causii as
to death could be found, but If is
thought it was possibly due Jo
cramps nr sun stroke.

power department, where he was
greatly liked by his employer and
associates on account of his quiet
manners and sunny disposition, of
which the latter brought him the
sobriquet of "Happy," and , was
much beloved by his companions,
and his death will be greatly
mourned by them. Although his
presence among his young associates
will be missed, there are none that
will miss his smile' and presence
as his poor, heartbroken father,
mother, brothers and sister, who are
left to mourn the loss of the baby of
the family.
The funeral services were held
Tuesday at 9:00 a.m., at the Roman
Catholic church, at which a high
mass of requiem was celebrated by
RevT C. D. Trottier, interment being
made in the old Catholic cemetery.
The funeral was under the direction
of G. G. Smith and the pall bearers,
0. Lacroix, J. St. Pierre, A. Sey
mour and J. Murphy, who were for
mer associates of the deceased. The
many beautiful floral offerings that
surrounded the casket and the large
attendance at the services testified
to the popularity in which Archie
was held. In this hour of sorrow the
sympathy of all is extended to the
bereaved family.
Card of Thanks
To all the friends whose sympathy
and services were so kindly tendered
in our time of bereavement we wish
to express our thanks.
