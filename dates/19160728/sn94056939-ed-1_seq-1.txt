CAN NOMINEE FOR GOVERNOR
Tho Magdalena Nows is ttndoubt
0(11 on tho right truck when it says
tho movement for tin nntninntinn
of Hon Frank A HtimVII is bolu
encouraged by thobuslnessinterosts
ot tho stuto, and moro particularly
the ve-slouk interests, which are
gn closely connected with the ogri
cultural interests of the stnto be
cause of I lie development of the
feeding industry.
The News calls attention to the
fact that the live stock interests
tho nation have been fighting for
years to break tho strangle hold o
the meat packers on both tho buy
leg and selling markots of the nation
and Mint the fight, bus now been
taken into congress, where the live
stock growers have gono asking fo
a congressional investigation of the
packers and their methods.
When it is considered tliut the
protection of the llvo stuck intorests
of this stato incnntf the protection
of the largest taxpoyer interest
with tho oxception of tho railroad
it can beMnderslood that thousands
of tho most substantial citizens
thn state must be closely identlfie
with any movement for its prottc
tion or advancement, and that the
success of the live stock growers
will soon bo closiily identified with
those thousands who will gn hit
tho feeding of live stock, it is not
hard to understand tho movement
towards Hubbell, who is heovil
interested In sheep, cattle, ranches
forming, banking aitd almost every
other real interest of the state.
BURSUM WILL BE NOMINATED
Mr. Dorsum is practically asstir
ed of the ropublloan nominal inn
for governor. Evon tho Albuquer
quo Journal, a paper that can
hardly bo accused of holng partial
to him, estimates that ho will have
a good safe majority over all com
petitors in the state convention.
Tho probability that Mr Hursutn
will be elocted is equally strong
Ho was beaten for thn governorship
at the first stato election, to be
sure, but political conditions in
tho commonwealth havt changed
radically hIiico t lion. At least nine
ty par cent of tho ovsral thousand
progressive votes that wero east
against him years ago will be cast
for him at tho approaching election
and, besides, at least two strongly
republican counties that went over
into th democratic column became
of factional differences aro now
normal again and will glveltho old
timo majorities for tho republican
ticket. II O. Bursuni will be our
next governor and he will give tho
state a wlso and bonefioent adminis
tration. Socorro Chieftain
Hobt. Stldham and family and
Dr. Pine and family have returned

south fork of tho Bonito.
