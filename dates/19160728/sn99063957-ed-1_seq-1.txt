TERRIFIC HOT
WAY TO ALTANTIC COAST
Weather Bureau Predicts 100 Degrees for Seaboard, and
Abnormally Hot Weather Due On Pacific Coast-Last
Night 26 Deaths in Chicago Were Due to Heat, and In
24 Hours Total Was 44 Little Hope Held Out of
Lower Temperature . .' ,
Washington, July 28. The weather bureau today held
out a little hope to the middle west that the terrific heat
of the past few days might soon come to an end but any
hope for that section is at the expense of the Atlantic
seaboard. (
There is 100 degree weather in sight along the coast,
it is declared. And this will mean greater suffering than
has been felt in the middle west, where, for the most part
the humidity has been low.
A series of thunderstorms presaged by the increasing
heaviness of the atmosphere in the Mississippi Valley may
break the tropic spell it is believed. If it does not, the
weather that has been ruining crops in the country and
smothering babies in the cities is likely to continue. The
Northwest shows no atmospheric conditions that would
aid to bring about the prayed for change this side of the
Rockies. At the weather bureau the blame is placed on
"Bermuda high." That is a way of saying the area of
high pressure air over Bermuda and the surrounding
Atlantic is largely responsible for keeping the weather
elsewhere. This area of high pressure air has prevented
the hot currents from the mainland from moving out
to sea. - -
Even the Pacific Coast is not to be exempt, it was said
today, and may expect an abnormally warm spell in the
course of a few days.
Chicago, July 28. Twenty six per-
Rons died here during the nieht ns a re-1

Gerrhan Officer Predicts War;
Will Last Long Germany
Holds Fast All She Gained
By Carl W. Ackerman.
(United Press staff correspondent.)
With the German Army Before Ver
dun, July 27. (Via Berlin, Amster
dam anu London.) Germany's mastery
here at Verdun ro'obed the French of
their greatest chance to co-operate in
the allied drive. If French positions
had not been under attack by the Ger
man forces, troops under the tri-colors
could have had hammered there simul
taneously with the British thrust. But
Germany now dominates the city.
German officers say the main thing
now is not whether Germany is to take
Verdun jut that the Teutonic forces
remain as masters of the battlefield.
Traveling all along the German front
in this section, talking with officers and
men, I find a different opinion as to
the war's end from that entertained
elsewhere. The belief of all was best
expressed tonight , by the grandson of
Geueral Von Steuben, the Prussian hero
of the revolutionary war, - who said:
"The war will last long."
For 10 miles on each side of the Ver
dun trenches, the face of the earth has
literally been blown off. It is poet
marked with shell craters, in some
places vast holes 30 to 50 feet deep.
Fighting has gone on under ground.
Universal respect is accorded French
bravery by the Germans here. "French
bravery in the underground trenches,"
said one staff officer, "was what pre
vented "uerman troops from capturing
the city.' "i
Today, from the summits of Hills 171
and 310 the progress of artillery at
tacks on the hills of Froid Terre, Thin
mont, L 'Homme Mort, could be plain
ly observed, as well as the details, of
small infantry attacks, tor fourteen
hours the newspaper correspondents
were permitted to walk and ride along
this enormous battlefield. From ob
servations on the journey and from con
versation with the men who are doing
the fighting, I am convinced the Anglo
French offensive has not affected the
German positions here. Preparations
before Verdun were temporarily halt
ed only by order from German head
quarters. At dawn this morning, I motored to
ward the battlefield from Hill 171 and
viewed the famous left bank of the
Mens. Forges immediately below the
hill were (rumbled into ruins. Here
STREET CAR STRIKE
CLAIMS FIRST LIFE
Brakes Would Not Work, Car
Ran Away and Strike
breaker Is Killed
New Tork, July 28. The strike
which has tied up surface cars in the
Bronx and Westchester county, and
which threatens to extend throughout
Manhattan, claimed its first life early,
today. When brakes on a car at 177th
and Boston Road failed to work for
some unknown reason, and the car
and a trailer plunged down hill and
were splintered against a subway pillar,
Motorman B. Horn, a strikebreaker,
was
instantly killed and two plain
clothes men and another strikebreaker
were seriously injured.
The accident followed minor clashes
in which many cars were put out of
commission and SO or more men re
ceived minor injuries. Several hun
dred police reserves were on duty today
while national officials of tho Amalga
mated Association of Street Knilway
men threatened to tie up surface lines
of Manhnttnn.
William B. Fitzgerald, head organ
izer of the strikers, announced today
that he had received offers of financial
support from Portland, Ore.; Cleveland,
Boston and Chicago.

land, where no one was permitted to
enter. Towns near-ubout were in ruins.
In the distance Dead Man 'a hill was dis
cernible it's brownish summit flecked
by white puffs of shrapnel shells in the
blue sky. Through field glasses, dusty
furrows ploughed up me slope by
French artillery shells could be plainly
seen, the shells exploding after churn
ing the ground in irergular rows.
From Hill 171 we motored in a round
about way behind the lines to Hill 310
which the French bombarded yesterday.
Fresh shell craters scarred the daisy
and poppy field. Below a spider web
of trendies led to Fort Souville. Near
by was another hill bombarded into a
brownish mass of soil. Through glasses
the German lines near Forid, Terre and
Thiumout were dimly discernible, mark
ed more plainly by the line of exploding
shrapnel in the sky than oil the earth.
Later we visited the Argonne forest.
If the earth had been robbed of nil
living things for 10 miles on either aide
of the trenches behind the lines, the ac
tivitymakes up for it. Soldiers go to
and from the trenches in automobile
transports. Bodies of recruits maneuver
on hill sides being schooled in band
grenade and other attacks from old line
trenches, captured long ago. Little
Serbian ponies, burdened under machine
guns scurry back and forth. French
women and childrenworking in the
fields or playing in the streets are ev
erywhere seen. Here and there soldiers
are burying ammunition of building
store houses. Enormous supplies of
grain and foodstuffs are being stacked
in temporary shelters.
It may be said that the Verdun op
erations have goue through two stages
first everything above the ground in
front of the trenches was swept away,
second, German advances carried the
strongest points held by the French.

London, July 8. The same desuernte
hand to hand fighting by which the
British wrested 5'oziercs from the Teu
tons was proceeding today in tho out
skirts of Longuojial and beyond the Del
ville woods northeast of that town, as
well as in the FJirueoux woods.
Gen. Haig reported that in one of
these clashes aft Delville woods his
troops had been successful. The Ber

The British report had it that strong

been beaten off with heavy loss to the
Teutons.

to "the highest .strength." Both Lon

points but asserted they were ejected
by counter attacks. Berlin made no
claim of German troops occupying any
ground, out spoKC of booty m mens and
in guns and concluded wit hthe declar
ation that the allies could not boast of
any progress.
South of the Soinme official state
ments from both sides indicate heavy
artillery. duels. The French statement
revealed first success of the Russian
troops sent to fight on the Flanders
battle front in a reconnoitering expedi
tion at Aubervive. Berlin and Paris
reports agreed on fighting around Thin
mont, both claiming repulse of attack.
Petrograd merely reported successful
advance of Russian troops both in the
sector around Brody and in tho Caucas
us. The Berlin version admitted con
siderable ground gained by the czar's
torces in tne northeast or Svmiuchy,
but stated counted attacks wero pro
gressing. Fighting is Fierce.
London, July 28. Until today Bri
tish troops fighting to push through in
the Pozieres sector, have been thrust
ing up hill. Today they have the ad
vantage of attacking an enemy unaid
ed by natural cover and now ousted
from the permanent steel and eoncreto
constructed trenches, perfected in tho
long months of the deadlock in the
line. i.
Foremost among the disadvantages of
General Haig's position was the fact
that the kaiser is making superhuman
efforts to stem any further breuk in his
lines. Reserves have been stripped from
nil along the remainder of the German
front to be massed neninst tho British
or used in desperate attacks. Special
dispatches from Verdun sny the German
attack there has waned into a mere ordi
nary assault instead of the holocaust
of flame from artillery with which the
French fortress has been deluged during
the lust six months with practically no
concerted infantry attacks.
Experts here agree that the kaiser
will make desperate attempts in con
certed counter attacks to win back th
ground wrung inch by inch almost
from his soldiers by the British. An
advance very much farther along the
frond from Pozieres'to Bapaume by the
British troops would menace the Ger
man forces further south
Beat the Brandenborgera.
London, July 28. British troopshave

Fifth Braudeuburgers were the Teutonic
troops thus ejected from the little area
northwest of Longueval-which has been
the scene of hand to hand fighting fsi

"One hundred and sixty-three prison

Haid reported. "Two German counter

Cleveland, Ohio, July 2S. The four
railway brotherhoods today notified the
rnilroads committee that they are pre
pared to resume conferences on an eight
hour day at 10 hour pay and time and
a half for overtime, on August 1 in New
York. The brotherhood officials hope
for a satisfactory settlement of the de

roads.
The brotherhood officials will go in
to the conference backed up with the
power of the referendum vote of 300,
000 railway employes to "act as they
deem best" in case the deadlock can
not be broken by argument.
A stutement from brotherhood qunr

"The vote docs not necessarily mean
a strike because the ballot only auth
orizes the chief executives of the four
brotherhoods to call a strike provided
a satisfactory settlement cannot be ob
tained from the railroads.
"The ballots wero sealed in envelopes
