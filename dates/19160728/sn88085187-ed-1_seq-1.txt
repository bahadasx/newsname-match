Expert Says End of Second
I Year Sees Militarism In Its
Death Throes, But German
Nation Will Survive.
BY J. W. T. MASON
Noted American Expert on European War
Militarism is in its death throes as the S^COttd year of the Wot clostS. It is lighting on the
defensive, and U approaching inevitable surrender.
The allies have demonstrated that tl^f.< MUST continue the conflict indefinitely to de
feat the militarists of Germany. Time are signs that the German people arc realising this
fact, and) to save their empire, eventually will refuse to accept the policies of professional
loklier*.
I hi^ is the main result ot" Europe's two wars of warfare: GERMANY WILL SI K
VIVE THE WAR; BUT PUUSSIAN MILITARISM WILL NOT.
The second year of the conflict ha'i given the central empires a stronger territorial hold
in Russia, am! has »een the complete c>wquesi <>t Serbia. It has also witnessed a large vie«
tory in Asia Minor by Russia, and th* lo»« t(> Germany of almost all that remained of her co
lonial empire,
BUT THE STUDY OF MILITARY MAI'S HAS NO LONGER THE IMPORT*
ANCE IT HAD EARLIER IX THE WAR.
The Russians may gain Galicia and may enter northern and eastern Hungary! '''c *
British and trench nitty compel a large retirement of the Germans m Hie ufst; never
theless, it is not essential llml these victories be K'OH in order /<» defeat (i''nnan\ i.
Now Comes the Era When Voice of German Civilian Will Be Heard
PRUSSIAN MILITARISM CANNOT SURVIVE SENDING MEN AFTER MF.N
TO BE EXTERMINATED WHILE THE GERMAN POPULATION AT HOME IS
COMPELLED TO LIVE u\* EVER SHORTENING RATIONS.
The vital fact of the second year of the war has been the failure' of the central powers to
devise a way to break through the British blockade and provide adequate loud supplies for the
German people.
Prussian militarism Foresaw an astonishingly large number of things that would hapi>eii
in a world war: hut it has shown during the past year that it did not foresee the necessity for
providing for the wants of the German civilian population during a protracted struggle.
As the conflict enters upon its third year, the German civilians are assuming greater and
greater importance in the German empire. When their influence becomes sufficiently dom
inant to overhear the militarists, the war will eid.
Thus, the war in its third year will take ok an entirely new aspect.
Victories, in the old sense, are no longer necessary to success.
At the peace conference, the controlling influence will rest with that side which can ki!! n
larger numbers. This control, of course, must he exercised within limits hut it will make the
actual areas of conquered territory held by either side of secondary importance.
Three great nations arc now at work kiting Germans, Ihe Germans lire slaughter
ing in return, but the losses of the allies arc divided among the British, French and Rus
sians.
'Hie losses inflicted by the three allies fall upon the Germans exclusively, excqrt along a
small part of the eastern front, where the Austin-Hungarians are making a Stand
Every Teuton Casualty Is a Step in Direction of Peace
No country on short rations can continue the strain indefinitely of tending its men
against the machine guns of three enemies at once in a permanently defensive campaign.
For a long time, Germany's heavy casualties were home with fortitude, and in fact,
with pride, because her armies were winning successes in east and west. Now, however, the
possibility of gaining further field successes which can have any serious meaning for Ger
many has vanished.
Hereafter, certainly two and possibly three Germans are destined to fall for each sin
gle casualty in the ranks of any one of the three nations that are attacking the German fronts.
These are the facts that point to the coming collapse of Prussian militarism. The diplo
mats of the allies have assisted in the work by announcing they have no desire to crush Ger
many. The militarists, therefore, are unable t> urge their conquering ideals upon civilian
public opinion as the only alternative to the bbttingout of the German nation.
Hoiv soon the inevitable overthrow of the militarists will happen cannot be foretold.
The degree of persistence with which the allies- continue their attacks will have much influ
ence on the quick strengthening of cnnlian opinion in Germany.
The growth of this opinion and its gradual seizure of power in Berlin will be the most
important factor to watch in ail the belligerent nations, during the third year of the ivar. It
is destined to bring the war to and end on th" grave of Prussian militarism, after which it
may begin the creation of a Mdl Germany. \
