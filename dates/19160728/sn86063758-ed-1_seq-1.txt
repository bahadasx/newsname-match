BIRD'S-EYE VIEW OF
RURAL CREDIT ACT
What the New Law Proposes to Do
terest Nerer to Exceed 6 Per Cent.
News and Courier.
Washington, July 25.?Many long
and complicated explanations of the
Rural Credits Act have been published.
These have wearied or confused
the average reader. On the other
hand, most of the brief descriptive
references to the Act have been too
general to give a clear idea of the
modus operandi.
What the ordinary citizen would
like to know is how the new rarm
loan system is to work and how the
farmer is to secure access to its benefits.
The main features and the principle
can be shown in a few words
as follows:
Under the Rural- Credit Act the
country is divided into twelve districts,
each of which has a federal
land bank. These banks which back
each other's loans, form the divisional
links of a system which is centrally
supervised by a federal farm loan
board of five members, appointed by
the President.
The Government supplies $9,000,000
to stacrt each of the twelve farm land
/ banks with $750,000 capital, the money
being returned to the Government as
the banks become gradnally the property
of the farmers themselves, as
will be explained later in this article.
Tha fori oral land 'hanks lend thrOUPTh
local farm loan associations in
amounts from $100 to $10,000 on approved
farm lands estimated to be
^orth twice the amount of the loan.
These farm loan associations are really
banks, except that they cannot receive
deposits. Neither can the federal
land banks.
It takes ten or more farmers in a
community to form a local associatmTi
-and thftv must desire to borrow
at least $2fo,000 from the federal land
bank of their district. If the character
of thes^ men and the lands they
offer as security are approved by tho
officers of the federal system, a charter
is issued to them.
After being chartered, each local association
can receive ,application for
loans from as many farmers in its
territory as have land to cover the
amount. To get the money, however,
each applicant must become a member
of the local association and take
stock in it to the extent of 5 per cem
of his borrowings. Similarly, tlie association
itself must take stock in the
farm land bank of the district to the
extent of 5 per cent of the money
leaned ^through the association by the
bank.
Thus it will -be seen that the local
associations "will gradually acquire, foj
the automatic operation of the sys
tern, al of the stock of the twelve
district banks, and that the borrowers
through the local associations will
in1 the Same way acquire all of the
stock of the associations. In other
words, the borrower in a few years
"Rill own the entire system, the Gov
eminent being left with no functions
except protective regulation.
Borrowers will be required to pay a
certain proportion of the principal of
their loans every year. This annual
payment, constituting what is called
-'amortization," will be smaller in proportion
to the length, of time the loan
Ls to Tun, which time is never to be
more than forty years nor less than
five.
The "rate of interest Is not to ex^
ft rvp-r fpnt in anv r\pt;p arid
nc-ver to be more than 1 per cent more
than the rate of interest carried by
the last bond sold by the land ban!*
when the loan was made.
Additional capital necessary to operate
and expand the system is to be
obtained from the sale of bonds based
on the mortgages owned by the land
banks, all of these banks being jointly
responsible for the bonds. Being
thus backed, these securities are expected
to be in such demand as safe
investments that in a few years the
- ^ + Ann rr A+- oil "fVl A
liiriut;! wiiu gvjvm icmu tan cm
capita! the land justifies at 6 per cent
or less in any part of the country.

[ TO AID SUFFERERS
IN FLOOD REGIONS
Whalej Presents Measures Providing
$100,000 for Relief in
South Carolina.
Washington, July 25.?Appropriations
totalling $800,000 for the relief
of storm and flood sufferers in North
Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia.
Alabama and Mississippi are provide!
in joint resolutions introduced todaj
in the house and referred to the committee
on military affairs. The resolutions
also authorize the secretary oi
war to issue quartermasters' and medical
supplies to the needy.
The appropriations are divided
among the States as follows: North
Carolina, $300,000; Soutli Carolina,
$100,000; Georgia, $200,000; Alabama
and Mississippi, $200,000.
In addition to these sums $400,000 is

Last Friday by Representatives
Lee and Burnett. Of this sum $300,000
would be spent in central 'Ailaba-1
ma, which recently was flooded, and
the remainder would be spent for relief

Representative Britt introduced for
North 'Carolina and provides for the
I expenditure of $300,000 in Buncombe,"
Henderson, McDowell, Rutherford,
Polk, Haywood, Mason, Jackson, Clay,

now are investigating conditions
in the flooded district of the
State at the instance of Representai
tive Webb, who has supplied the re1:
partment with photographs of flooa
I damage and other data which have
j been sent to him from North Carolina.
j The $100,000 proposed for outh
Carolina by Representative Whaley
would be spent along the Santeb
river and its tributaries, which, went
out of their banks last week at the
. same time western North Carolina
:
was flooded.
Representatives Adams, Howard
! ;nd Bell were authorities of the reso'
lution for Georgia and they proposed

: The editor has received a communi1
cation and a newspuaper clipping
from Levi Jones the noted travellert
tramp who passed through 'Newberry
j in January on a hike from Augusta,
Georgia, to Chicago, 111. Jones in hi.?
' j letter which is a little short of the
j best literary style and spelling, says:
? "dear Editor, I donte forget you nor

trying to get through. I have too
i hundred more miles to make to Chica'!
go. I have too hundred postmarks on

CARD FROM DR. E. 3T. KIBLER
Editor of The Herald and News:
I learn that there "has been some little
misunderstanding tas to my rej
marks at the Whitmire campaign
meeting concerning the appointment
a whiskey constable for this county.
My statement, in effect, was that I
saw no need for this appointment,
and regarded it as a waste of the
money of the taxpayers. I did not intend
to say that Sheriff Blease wa?
responsible for the appointment. I
} am reliably informed that he ha6
Tiothin? whatever to do with' it. I
~hnll be glad if you will publish thh
oard.
Yours very truly,
E. X. Kibler. |
