THE LONGSHOREMEN'S SIDE OF THE CASE
A STATEMENT OF FACTS COVERING THE PACIFIC COAST
STRIKE AND THE CAUSES LEADING UP THERETO
The following is an official state•
ment of the executive board of the
I. L. A. The attitude assumed by the
"Employers' Unions" should enlighten
the public as to the reasctn of the
strike:
YOU SHOULD KNOW WHO IS
RIGHT
Riggers and Stevedores' Union of
Seattle. Pacific Coast District of the
International longshoremen's Asso
ciation, San Francisco, July 7, 1916. —
In introducing this statement we
wish to po'tnt out that while nearly
all classes of labor have received sub
stantial increases in wages and bet
terment In working conditions all
over the country, during the past few
years, by agreement with employers,
and in many cases several increases
and better working conditions have
bene granted voluntarily by em
ployers however, the longshoremen
of the Pacific Coast ports have not
received any Increase in wages or
better working conditions in the past
few years, except a few isolated cases
in seme ports in which the employers
were paying much less wages than
was necessary to keep competent
longshoremen on the job. Oln the
contrary', the wages of longshoremen
on this coast have been reduced and
working conditions made harder by
the Introduction of modern gear and
speeding up methods during the past
few years.
The Pacific Coast district conven
tion of longshoremen which met in
Seattle, Wash., May Ist of this year,
was composed of representatives
from every port on the coast. In re
viewing the situation the aforemen
t oned representatives found that
while our employers had increased
their profits from five to eight hun
dred per cent, they had granted us no
increase, nor in any way tried to
make the unbearable conditions un
der wlvch our members worked any
better, except the few cases hereto
fore mentioned. Therefore, it was
decide d by unanimous vote of the said
convention, in view of the prosperous
conditions enjoyed by our employers,
to request a modest increase kn wages
and more humane working conditions
for all ports on the coast, uniformity
in wage.s and work'ng conditions and
rules being the <yne question that re
ceived careful consideration and was
: dopted in order that no one port
should enjoy all advantages in this
respect that was not enjoyed by al'
ports alike.
Consequently, a Pacific coast wage
scale and working rules governing all
ports and effective June Ist was pre
sented to our employers. Many fair
minded employers agreed to the said
wage scale and work'ng rules, and
announced their willingness to com
ply therewith. The Waterfront Em
ployers' U,nion, composed of some of
the principal employers on the coast,
refused to grant the Increase and was
INJUNCTIONS IN TACOMA
The federal court in Tacoma re
cently issued injunctions against the
striking longshoremen forbidding
them to put in an appearajice upon
or near any of the docks in Tacoma.
A fair sh'p belonging to Rothschild
& Jones has betin lying in Tacoma

decided to try the metal of the conrt.

The said Waterfront Employers'
Union immediately appealed to the
Federal Department of Labor for
mediation. Hon. Henry M. White was
detailed by Secretary of Labor WVlsoai
to act as mediator between the em
ployers and the Pacific Coast D'strict
executive committee. Mr. White, in
conjunction with the executive com
mittee of the Waterfront Federation
of San Francisco, arranged a con
ference between the Employers'
Union and our executive board June
Bth. This conference resulted in an
agreement being reached on the
morning of June 9th, and read as
follows:
San Francisco, June 9, 1916.

ence Between the Executive Board of
the Pacific Coast District of the I. L.

parties are adopted by referendum

it will be noticed that one of the
ccf.iditions especially laid stress upon
was that tke conferences were to con
tinue immediately, yet as soon as the
district executive board had suc
ceeded In having our members return
o work under the above terms, we
were informed by the Employers'
Un'on that no further conferences
would be held before June 26th. The
district executive board thought this
*o be a rather strange attitude for the
employer! to assume and prot >stel
against deferring action. Mediator
White at our request endeavored to
have the conferences resumed June
16th, or as soon thereafter as possi
ble, but met with a flat refusal from
the employers. The district executive
hoard then began an Investigation to
ascertain just what the employers
had in view or intended to do in re
gards to the agreement our members
had resumed work under. We found
'he employers still retaining their
strike-breakers. We also found that
they were making preparations to
gather and hou.-e b"m more strike

ARMOUR REAPS GOLDEN
HARVEST IN AUSTRALIA
Syracuse, N. V., July 2". How Ar
mour & Co., the beef packers, are
reaping a golden harvest from the
Australian drouth which threatens
that country with a prolonged famine,
was told here today by George B.
Langdon, who Just returned from
.Melbourne.
"So terrible has the drouth been in
its effects that cattle and sheep are
dying for want of fodder," Langdon
explained. "Seizing this advantage,
the United States beef trust has been
buying up sheep, for instance, at 2%
pence a pound on the hoof, imme
diately reselling at regular market
prices to the allies, with whom they
are holding large contracts.
"Of course, the trust manages to
pocket a handsome profit in this way.
It also buys up the cattle, which are
practically dying on the native ranch
ers' hands, for they cannot afford to
buy fodder at the stupendous prices
asked for it since the drouth set in,
and there tire no natural pasturing
grounds worth the name left."
The loss of 180,000 able-bodied men
who have gone from the country to
join the aU'es, Langdon said, is af
fecting the commonwealth seriously.
Incidentally, there Is a grain shortage
in Australia, he declared, and instead
of exporting wheat, the country is
compelled to import it.
Food prices have risen enormously,
according to Langdon, although a
food commission established by the
commonwealth has prevented exorbi
tant charges for necessities to a great
extent.
SHINGLE WEAVERS
WILL FIGHT TO FINISH
A rousing meet'ng was held in the
Labor Temple last Sunday afternoon.
Many out-of-town members attended.
The spirit manifested by the Weavers
is that they are determined to win at
all hazards. They have originated a
scheme whereby they can keep strik
ing indefinitely without any of their
members feeling the pinch of neces
sity. So if GkJV. ClOUgh or the Kernel
think they have them I'cked, they
have another think coining. Reports
coming in from all parts radicate they
have the situation almost in control.
The boys feel more encouraged now
than at the beginning of the Btrike.
When are the tax-payers of Everett
going to howl at paying for the keep
of these special police? is a question
that Chief of Police Kel'y will have
to answer in the near future. We do
not see any necessity for these extra
men. There is absolutely no trouble
—not even a drunk to be taken care
of —as the police court proceedings
prove. Somebody w.ll be doing some
tall explaining pretty soon.

gov ch r a n m °c e e WHAT HAS BECOME OF MILLION DOLLARS?
Niagara Falls. N. V.. July 27. —There
is a strike on at the plant of the Car
borundum Company, and there is
every Indication that the national
guard will be called upon.
Under the Stivers law the governor
may call upon the very men on strike 1
in a city and turn them into soldiers
whose duty it would be to gjuard the
property of the company they struck.
The Carborundum Company plant
is at present surrounded by a police
guard, comprising all the available
polxemen of Niagara Falls. This was
established after a conference be
tween officials of the company and of
the city administration.
The police guard zone extends sev
eral blocks on each side of the plant.
No one may walk within the zone if
he : s a striker, or unless he can show
that he lives there or has legitimate
business there. The streets are pa
trolled day and night. No effort has
made to curb the lawlessness of
the sir ke-breakers, who are fully
armed. One hundred and fifty armed
guards supplement the police force.
"The backbone of the strike is
broken," is the jubilant tone of the
(Officials. How true this is may be
j judged from the fact that the plant is
! being run by a force about one-tenth
I the regular one, and is hardly turning
out any work. There la also a strike
on at the Electro-Metallurgical Com
pany's plant. The plant is in part : al 1
operation, having also received police
protection.
No one can tell how soon trouble'
will break out. Citizens resent the
presence of the armed thugs. Many
here believe that it is a short step to

PACIFIC COAST LONGSHOREMEN CHARGE BETRAYAL OF
STRIKERS BY FRISCO POLITICAL LABOR SKATES
"No Compromise, No Quarter," Is Seattle Strikers' Reply
The first question to settle in the
minds of thinking people is "Where
has the million-dollar slush fund
gone raised by the San Francisco
Waterfront Employers' Union to fight
the striking Longshoremen?" The
Pacific Coast longshoreman knows
where much of it has gone, and
imag'nes the Riggers and Stevedores
of Frisco also know.
Let us glance at the personnel of
th" executive committee of the Water
front federation of San Francisco,
not forgetting the fact that these are
the people who have blocked the way
of the Pacific coast district board in
their negotiations with the ship
owners:
First comes J, H. McLaughlin, pres
ident of the Material Teamsters, and
labor commissioner of the Stale of
California: Paul Sharrenberg, of the
Sailors' Union: J. Corey, of the Hoist
ing Engineers; Patrick Flynn, presi
dent of the Marine Firemen, Oilers
and Water Tenders; Barnes, of the
Pile Drivers: Michael Casey, presi
dent of the Brotherhood of Teamsters
and past president of the Board of
Public Works, reputed to be worth a
million dollars.
Now to the committee of the Rig
gers and Stevedores of San Francisco,
who, in conjunction with the above
named men, violated the instructions
of the Seattle convention of the
I. L .A.:
John Kean, past president of the
Pacific Coast D*Strict of the 1. L. A.,
also deputy labor commissioner to
J, H McLaughlin; M. T. Doyle, busi
ness agent of the Riggers and Steve
dores, who ran at the Seattle conven
tion for the presidency of the district
and was overwhelmingly defeated;
McNulty .business agent of the Rig
gers and S'evedores. and Ryan, busi
ness agent of the Oakland Riggers
and Stevedores; Thos. A. Maloney, a
well-known lickspittle, peanut poli
tician and now a candidate for the
state assembly in the Twenty-first
District, a weak tool of the above'
men, a mi mber of the local strike
committee.
The following is an exact copy ot
ibe agreement entered into by the
above named men with the Water
front Employers' Union, desp'te the
explicit orders of the Seattle conven
tion that all settlements made must
be made by the district board and
must be coastwise settlements:

Lies the Hope
of Labor
Tuesday, August 1. 2 p, m . in the
City of San Francisco, to adjust work
ing conditions and wages. It is agreed
between the employees and employers
that any adjustment of conditions and
wages agreed upon at the above con
ference shall be effective August 1,
1916.
"Should longshoremen at other
ports not resume work under condi
tions and terms of agreements in ef
fect on May 31, 1916, owing to dif
ferences between them and the em
ployers, the members of the Water
front Employers' Union of San Fran
c'sco agree to employ union men di
rect to do such work as they control
under the terms and conditions of
the agreements existing at the va
rious ports on May 31, 1916."
The San Francisco Chronicle plain
ly stated that the above named men
were working hand in hand with the
Commercial Club and the Chamber of
Commerce. From the first arrival of
the District Board in San Francisco
the executive committee of the Water
front Federation placed all and every
obstacle in the way of the board meet
ing with the Employers' Union, their
claim being that they should have a
say in the settlement.
Imagine the measiy political crooks
of San Francisco having a say in the
I business of the Pacific Coast District
|of the International Longshoremen's
Association .
One amusing feature in the whole
proceedings is the action of M. T
Doyle, business agent of the San
Francisco Kiggers and Stevedores
When Thomas Olsen, the union man.
was murdered by the negro strike
breakers. M. T Doyle demanded of
the District Board that every man
upon the coast working for the Em
ployers' Union be again called out on
strike. When this was agreed to by
he District Board, M. T. Doyle ap
pended his signature to the Btlil
j Doyle for some reason or other
i (monetary, we presume I now is doing
his level be,st to drive the members
of his union back to work and leave

That the membership n Frisco will
