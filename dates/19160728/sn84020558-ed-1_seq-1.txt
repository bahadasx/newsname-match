LONDON. July 28 Since the completion of the capture of Pozieres the
news from the British front in France is mainly of artillery actions anj
it,no encounters at various points o n the 'German line. The comparative
lull and hot, haiy weather, it is assumed. ' -ve oiven the Germans ah
opportunity to bring up further troops and nuns with a view to renewed
attempts to recapture Poizeres, where . however, accordinq to unofficial re
ports, the British troops have further consolidated their positions.
Toriqhfs official report shows that there has been hard fiqhtinq all
Hay with some fluctuations of fortune, but that in the end the British
improved their positions northeast of Pozieres and in the vicinity of Long
ueval and Delville wood. ,
Similarly, from the eastern front there is little fresh news. There is
much comment in the European capitals on the effect the loss of the las.

I'aiie, the American ambassador, has
cabled to the state department at
Washington the text of a letter from
the foreign office regarding the feed
ing of the civilian population of terri
tory occupied by the Hermans. The
letter says:
"His majesty's government desires
to settle, once for all, the whole tpies
lion of the importation of foodstuffs
into territory in the occupation of the
enemy. Therefore, it makes the fol
lowing final proposal:
"It the Herman and Austro-llungar-
lan governments will reserve wholly to
the civil populations of occupied terri
tory the entire produce, of the soil,
. . . and if they will admit to those
territories neutrals selected by the
president of the United States with full
powers to control the distribution of
food to the whole population and to
transfer from tine territory to another
surplus stocks existing in one and
larking in the other, and if the presi
dent of the United States will under
take the selection of these agents, his
majesty's government will give them
every assistance and admit into such
territories any imported food supplies
necessary to supplement native stocks
and afford the population a fair sub
sistence ration, as long as It is satis
fied that Ihe enemies are scrupulously
observing their part of the Agreement.

heat in what, before this offensive,
would have been referred to as u vio
lent artillery duel.
This morning the British put on
Delville wood the heaviest concentra
tion of shell fire In a Kiven area ever
directed against field fortifications.
I'.veit Hie gunners were arnazi-d when
they computed its volume per minute
in preparing the way for the infan
try. Counting the front a thousand
yards, there must have been three
shells a minute falling on every yard.
The purpose was to leave nothing
.standing nothing living. Xot a single
Herman sniper in a tree, not a single
Herman machine gun, but was to be
put out of business by the tornado of
blasts, lielville wood has left Trones
wood with a tame reputation. The in
fantry of both sides there have no
dug-outs. Their only protection is
shallow trenches, such as are dug in
open field operation. A shell wuich
tears a hole among the roots of a tree,
killing a man, makes some protection
for his neighbor who surveys the
scene.
Snipers and machine guns watch for
any bead that shows itself. i'atrols
w hich go out in the night engage in
hand to hand encounters. The flash
of a bursting shell may reveal one
patrol to another and give it the ad-
vantage.
The Kritish had nearly all of the
Delville wood after the advance of
July 14, but the Hermans got an en-
made machine gun and she fire on
them ami took possession of the mid-

MOVING WEST
Repubtlcan A. P. Leased Wirel
WASHINGTON, July 7. A "Uer
muda high" is the official cause of the
worst heat wave that has enveloped
the country in fifteen years. Translated
from the cryptic language of the
weather sharps, that means a great
area of high pressure air has been
massing on the weather drill grounds
tin the Atlantic off Hermuda for the
last month and now has let go the
full power of its offensive from the
seaboard to the Rocky mountains.
For weeks it has stood like a solid
wall agaii.st heated currents trying
vainly to move out of the interior over
the ocean and now as it x.virls rapidly
along It Is gathering Heat and mois
ture from the tropics and sweeping
thrtn northward over tht continent
into the vacuum of so-called "low
pressure areas." Although its greatest
intensity has not yet struck the l'a
cific coast. It is expected to do so
within the next few days.
No relief is promised from the phe
nomena, which in the east has caused
sweltering' city dwell" is to light fire
in their homes to dry out the humid

is threatening to destroy millions of
dollars' worth of food crops. Chief
Forecaster F'lankenfield said tod. is
"hat the heat wave only ha.l begun. It
' certain to continue throngh the week
land probably longer. .None of the con -
unions essetlliai to a oreaitup are yet
evident. The relief which often comes
from the northwest is now here in sight
During all this month Forecaster
I'rankenfield says the huge body of
high pressure atmosphere has been
gathering over the western Atlantic
from F'lorid.i to Newfoundland and east
to the Azores. It is very heavy in
height and thick in dimension. Heavy
air always flows to a place occupied by
light air but unfortunately, there is at
present an area of light air in the trop
ics. When the heavy air arrives there,
it finds there Is still lighter air over the
continent. So it moves north in an
enormous sweep, burning hot from the
tropics and heavily laden with -sea
borne humidity. It is distributing this
heat and humidity over all the con
tinental I'nited States in what officials
call the "Hermuda high."
The air In the middle west is be
coming much heavier and it may form
a local center where the air currents
will clash in a series of thunderstorms
affording speedy relief through a read
justment of the areas of high pressure.
Fourteen Die in Chicago

lice and hospital records Indicated that
fourteen persons had died in Chicago
during the day either directly from
the excessive heat or from causes
largely induced by the heat. Forty-two

vision.
The clause referring to the exclusion
of the Ulster counties merely defines
the excluded counties, but says nothing
as to whether the exclusion is to be
permanent.
An interesting clause in the agree
ment not previously mentioned gives
the lord lieutenant of Ireland power to
summon conferences between members
for constituencies in the exccluded area
and members for the rest of Ireland

situation today is that a petition Is he

ARMY
Republican A. P. Leased Wire
WASHINGTON, July 27 Nearly
seven hundred millions , for national
defense in the fiscal year 1917 is the
aggregate of proposed appropriations
in the senate today with passage of
.lie army appropriation bill, carrying in
round numbers )314,UUU,uuu.
This grand total for preparedness
still is subject to revision, however,
because the army bill will follow the
naval bill in conference where reduc
tions are probable, despite the firm at
titude of I'resident Wilson in support
ing the liberal response of the senate
to the call for adequate defense.
The appropriations for preparedness
is they now stand are as follows:
Army $31 3.970,447.10
Navy 31.ri.sf,.S4:'..;:
Fortifications Hand) 2.ri.74S,tiriU.UU
Military Academy 2.23!4,3l,U.r7
Army and deficiency 27,;.!H,34S.U.r
Total $S.'. 343,017. 27
At- it passed the senate, the army
ill exceeded the appropriations made
by the house by more than $131,U00,UU0.
la the final hours of debate on the
measure the senate agreed to an ap
propriation of $2.0011,000 for relief of
dependent families of national guards
men and regular army soldiers in ser
vice in the Mexican emergency. Dis
tribution of the fund is left to the
discretion of the secretary of war, but
in no case shall any dependent family
receive more than $.'i0 a month.
An amendment agreed to yesterday
giving soldiers on the border the right
to vote ill the field at the November
election was eliminated from the bill
tin a point of order just before pass
age. As soon as the army bill was out
of the way, tile senate took up and
passed, after brief debate, the military
academy appropriation bill, tarrying
$2.23X.32N.r,7. an increase of $l.ul:i,f42
over the house authorization. In the
main, the senate approved the military
committee's increase over house ap
propriations in the army bill, although
theie were a few ledifctions in the
committee recommendations, due to
improvement in the Mexican situa
tion. Among the big appropriations
