LEAVES POST AT
WASHINGTON TO COPE
Congressman Returns To Dis
trict In Effort To Stem
Tide Toward Porter
JACKSON, Tenn., July 20.
There has been much talk in
political circles locally since the
announcement from Washington
and the assurance of T. W. Sims'
friends here that the hefty con
gressman would return to this
district to personally look after
his political fences. Such change
of attitude upon the part of the
congressman and his friends is
regarded by many here as very
significant, since it is remem
bered that Mr. Sims wrote to
many oi Jus constituents over
the district early in the cam
paign, requesting information
as to the advisability of return
ing to the district and was ad
vised by njany that it would not
be necessary. Thereupon, it
was announced through the pap
ers in a special from Washington
that Congressman Sims had
never left his post of duty even
to participate in campaigns for
his own renomination, and that
he would Remain stead fast to this
rule now that the country need
ed his services more than ever.
Dudley, Porter of Paris, who
announced his candidacy to suc
ceed Mr. Sims when the con
gressman announced his candi
dacy for United States senator
iblf the senatorial primary, has
vjfj'ti'st completed a thorough can
vass of the district, and it is re
ported that wreckage to the Sims
fences is the result. Anyhow,
the alarm among Sims' friends
here reached Washington, and
. the congressman suddenly fell
from the pedestal of the high
patriotic ideals formerly an
nounced, and left immediately
for the old Eighth.
It is believed by many who
keep in close touch with political
conditions here that the congress
man's friends were not willing
in his absence to assume respon
sibility for his foreshadowed
defeat. There is no doubt that
the path Mr. Sims has safely
traveled and that has been so
smooth for twenty years is now
not without rocks, and that he is
returning to make an effort to
smooth it out again. It is not
known who will manage Mr.
Sims' campaign, and the rumor
is gaining currency to the effect
that this, might possibly be one
of the causes of his unexpected
return to determine the ques
tion of manager and that the
toga, perchance, might fit the
form of Mr. J. D.Hunt, as Henry
Graper, Sims' former manager,
left the state several weeks ago,
and it is not known just when

MR. SIMS GIVES REPLY
To Letter Of Inquiry Regarding His Committee
Service In Congress.
(Lexington Progress)
In view of the circulated statement that after twenty years in
Congress, Mr. T. W. Sims is not Chairman of one or mere Com
mittees, The Progress publisher has made application to the Con
gressman himself for the information which is given in the letter
below:
EDITOR PROGRESS:
Lexington, Tenn.
Dear Sin
Replying to your letter of the 11th in which you ask why I am
not chairman of a committee at
since I have been a member of Congress, has any member of the
Ways and Means Committee been a member of any other commit
tee. The same also holds good as to the Committee on Appropria
tions. Of course, each of these committees has a chairman, but
neither the chairman nor any member of these two committees
have ever been appointed to the membership of any other commit
tee, however smalf or insignificant the committee might be. The ob
ject the House had in withholding membership on other committees
to members of thfse two committees was that it was deemed in
advisable to give them service on any other committees, because of
the importance of ;hese two committees and the time that it took
the members of thjese committees to properly consider all bills
coming before thejn.
In the Sixty-second Congress, which was the first Democratic
congress since I have been a member, I was made chairman of the
Committee of Waif Claims, retaining my position on the Committee
on Interstate and Foreign Commerce. But when the Sixty-third
Congress was elected there were two Democrats to every Republi
can or opposing party in the House, and in order to make room on
the several committees for the ne v Democratic members who had
been elected to that Congress, the Democratic caucus on organiza
tion decided that members of othjr leading committees besides the
Committee on Yays and Means imd the Committee on Appropria
tions would have to give up service on all other committees in
order that the large number of Democrats in the House might have
opportunity to get on the less important committees. So the Com
mittee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, the Committee on the
Judiciary, the Committee on Postoffices and Postroads, the Com
mittee on Military Affairs, the Committee on Naval Affairs, and a
few others were placed in the same class as the Committe on Ways
and Means and the Committee on Appropriations had been for
many years.
Therefore, I either had to give up my position, which was sec
ond on the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, by far
the most important committee in the House, or else give up my
chairmanship of the Committee on Wai Claims. This choice was
given me and, inasmuch as the matters coming before the Commit
tee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce were so exceedingly im
portant, I deemed it my patriotic duty to give up the chairmanship
of the committee on War Claims rather than give up service
on this great committee.
This explains why I am not a chairman of a committee at this
time. But it should also be stated that, in case Mr. Adamson, the
present chairman of the Committee on Interstate and Foreign
Commerce, should not be re-nominatod or re-elected, which is high
ly improbable, or that he should quit Congress or should desire
service on some other committee, I will immediately automatically
become chairman of the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Com
merce, which is now the greatest; chairmanship in the House.
You will see, therefore, as vvH! as all others who want to be
fair about the matter, that my not being chairman of a committee
at this time is due to to the fact that the Democratic caucus decid-

CAMPAIGN FOR F
Committee Still Meeting With
Encouragement and Much
Spirit Is Shown
BUSINESS MEN AND OTHERS
AIDING WORTHY MOVEMENT
People of County Becoming
Interested In Campaign
For Dormitory
Every day new names are being
added to the list of those who
have contributed to the fund for
the erection of a new dormitory
for boys at Grove High School.
The dormitory committee is meet
ing with much encouragement,
the people of both town and
county are showing interest and
so the movement seems certain
to meet with success.
Many Paris business men have
contributed liberally to the fund
and others are expected to do so
within the next few days. The
committee is doing everything
possible to get the necessary
amount raised and as early as
possible in order to get the work
on the building commenced.
Following is a supplementary
list of the contributors: Porter
Bros., $500; Dr. G. T. Abernathy
$25; James Bomar$2.50; W. H.
Cloys $5; D. M. Cooper $5; B. F.
Diggs $10; P. J. Beasley $10; S.
N. Petty $10; R. D. Caldwell $100;
J. W. Aclin $100; J. H. McSwain
$100; W. F. Balch $25; A. B.
Mitchum $25; John W. Phillips
Co., $100; Jos. Weinbaum & Bro.
$25; Humphreys Bros. & Foster
$50; Paris Grocery Co. $10; H. W.
Matheney $2.50; J. N. Currier $5;
B. Himelhoch $5; J. W. Blanton
$5; Gus Flake $5; J. H. AUen
$2.50; L. Cherry $2.50; W. G.
ed that mere membership on the great committee on which I am
second, or ranking member, is more to be desired and more useful
to our party and to the country, as well as to Congress, than being
chairman of any subordinate committee. I would not voluntarily
give up the position I have on this committee to be chairman of a
dozen little committees.
This identical same reason keeps Mr. Hull and Mr. Byrns from
being chairman of committees. For the simple reason that Mr.
Hull is a member of the Committee on Ways and Means and that
Mr. Byrns is a member of the Committee on Appropriations, they
are not allowed to be. chairman of other committees. So you see
that this charge, like many others, of my not being chairman, after
having been a member of the House for ten consecutive Congresses,
falls to the ground and should meet with the contempt it so justly
deserves.
Very sincerely, your friend,
(Adv.) T. W. Sims.

Those members of Company
L, Third Kentucky Infantry,
from Paris who were rejected at
Fort Thomas last week, returned
to their homes here Sunday. All
had a good time at the mobiliza
tion camp and a majority of the
boys probably regret very much
they failed to pass the physical
examination. A majority of
those rejected were under
weight.
Among those who were reject
ed and returned home Sunday
were Hall Fairleigh, Jasper
Rison, Crawford Chambers, Le
roy Hughes, George Edging,
Walter Ezell and John Ray.
The Kentucky troops will
probably leave for the Mexican
border within the next week or
ten days, Officers believe that
there is little doubt but that the
boys will see active service.
Company L lost 42 men on the
examination.
