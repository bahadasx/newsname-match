ROAD TO GERMANY
HILL CEMETERY
From good authority It is learned
lint a movement Is on foot to estab
lish a good road to Germany Hill
lemotery. Soveral prominent citi
zens have offered largo donations
towards the building ot the road, and
it is expected that other persons
whoso loved one are at rest in this
beautiful and sacred spot will aid in
the work. Many of St. Helens pio
neers havo their last resting place
on Germany Hill, and with such a
road as would mako the cemetery
accossiblo at all times of the year.
Those Interested think tho cemetery
would bo bettor kept nnd beautified.
By going a little farther north than
whore the present road starts, an
oasy grade can be had and a very
;ood road built at a nominal cost.
The Mist hopes that those responsible
for this road Idea will not slacken
their efforts until a good road Is
built to this beautiful cemetery.
TRENHOLM-PITTSBURG
MOUNTAIN HIGHWAY
A FINE GRADED ROAD
ItrpreNontutive of The Mist Taken an
Outing Itcyoml Trenliolm.
TO MEET BRIDE
FROM ACROSS OCEAN
Thos. E. Brown of Los Angeles,
a brother of Doputy Game Warden
Brown, was In tills city Wednesday
In company with his brother. He
was on his way to Now York to meet
his sweetheart from England after
an ongngemont of some nine years.
They played together as boy and girl
In merry England, and now the faith
ful girl loaves home and frtonds to
cross tho mighty deep to meet her
lovor. They will bo marriod immedi
ately on her arrival and will motor
across the continent to tholr Cali
fornia home. Mr. Brown is connect
ed with tho Universal Film Manufac
turing Company.
It was the pleasure of the writer
to visit a big section of Columbia
county Sunday. It was through tho
courtesy of L. R. Rutherford that we
were able to make this trip. In com
pany, therefore, with Mr. and Mrs.
Rutiierford and their boys and our
seven-eighths we autocd beyond
Thenholm, where we camped and en
Joyed a family picnic. We camped
by a spring near the farm of Peter
Serafin which afforded the finest and
purast water to be found anywhere.
The Trenholm-Pittsburg road is a
masterpiece of engineering skill and
at no point is the grade more than
5 per cent. This stretch of road is
about four and one-half miles in
length, commencing at the Wallls
place and ending at Trenliolm. It Is
graded the entire distance and winds
around through tho mountain hills,
presenting many attractive scenic ef
fects, and will be the means ot af
fording transportation at all seasons
of the year. It was a problem with
the county court where to secure the
necessary rock and it was feared that
the highway could not be constructed
with the amount appropriated, owing
to tho great distance that rock would
have to be hauled.
However, Mr. McCallister discov
ered -a rocky ledge about two miles
beyond Trenholm and upon investi
gation it was found to be genuine
basalt and in inexhaustible quantity,
a whole mountain- of it. It is located
at the site of the old dam which was
used tor flushing. It is quite acces
sible and two yards can be hauled to
Trenholm, where a helper team can
assist to the summit and it is down
hill the rest of the distance.
Peter Serafin has the contract for
making the coyote holes and he had
pierced the rock to a distance of 24
feet. It is the intention to fire the
blast August 5. This will be blasted
off to fill the gulch to make a road
way and location for the crusher.
The county court has purchased a
new 150-yard crusher which will be
delivered in a few days.
The rocking of this highway ia be
ing done under the direction of the
county court with Elon Felton as
supervisor. It Is the intention to ex
tend this road on into the Nehalem
country. That section has long been
Isolated from the county seat, es
pecially during the winter season,
and with the completion of tills road
a splendid outlet will be afforded.
However, it will require time to com
plete this work, but it will all be
accomplished In due course of tlmo.
Of the bond issue, $25,000 is the
amount appropriated for the Tren
holm road, and while we know but
little about road building It looks
like it will take that amount and
more, too, to complete the work. The
bridge at Trenholm is not in yet but
tho timbers are on the ground and
It will probably be completed by tho
time this paper is issued.
Enroute we could not help but not
ice the attractive school houses, all
neatly patntod and tha grounds well
kept. The Houlton school house in
West St. Helens Is perhaps the most
attractive building in that part of
the city. Yankton has a splendid
building nnd the patrons of that dis
trict are very proud of it and take
pride in- keeping it up.
School District No. 45, Happy Hol
low, Is a pretty little ouuutuS, t,u
It was a question with us whore ttu
scholars would come from. We learn
that thoy heve difficulty. In securing
sufficient adulta for the necessary
officials. This building has tho first
tap on the St. Helens water system.
Tho Trenholm school houso is tho
most attractive building in the place.
It commands a beautiful Bite of the
hill and is also well kept.
The hearty supMirt already
given, nsNuroN the success of
the Industrial Issue of the Mist.
The pnier will not lie a disap
pointment. It will help develop
St, Helens and Columbia
County.
