hand-to-hand lighting.
Strong counter-attacks were de

CAPTIVE BRITISH
Commander of "Brussels" is
Convicted of Trying to
Ram German Sub.
International News Service:
BERLIN, (via Sayville wireless)
July 2 8. Capt. Charles Fryatt, of
the British steamship Hrus-sels,
which was captured by the Ger
mans, has been executed, following
the passage of a death sentence
upon him by a naval field court sit
ting at Zeebrugge. The charge
against him was that he tried to
ram the German submarine V-?,Z on
March 2, 1915. in the North sea.
The following official version of
the proceedings were given out today
by the admiralty to the Overseas
News agency.
"At Zeebrugge on July L'7 there
was a session of a field court of the
navy corps to try Capt. Charles
Fryatt of the English steamer Brus
sels which had been brought in as
a prize. Fryatt was sentenced to
death, although not belonging to
the armed forces, because on March
2S. 1915. near Maase lireship he
tried to ram the German submarine
U-32. Fryatt, the first officer and
the first engineer received rrom the
British admiralty gold watches for
their brave conduct and were men
tioned in the house of commons.
"The F-T.3 had signalled the Brit
ish steamer to show her Tag and
fctop. but Capt. Fryatt refused to
heed the signal and turned at high
speed toward the submarine which
escaped only by submerging im
mediately for some metres. Fryatt
admitted that he had followed in
structions from the admiralty. The
sentence was confirmed and Fryatt
was shot for a 'franc tireur' crime
against armed sea German forces."

OF DEFENSE IS
Naval Bill in Conference With
Mooted Question of Cruisers
and Dreadnaughts
Promising Scrap.
ARMY MEASURE ALSO
WILL BE "DOCTORED
Task of Reconcilintj Differ
ences in Preparedness
Plan is Conceded to
be a Real Job.
international Newa Service:
WASHINGTON. July 28. The
entire program of national defense
became a subject of mediation today.
The navy bill was in conference with
the mooted question of battle cruis
era and dreadnoughts premising se
rious trouble with many days of
argument before a decision can be
reached.
The army bill, with its appropria
tions of $313.970,447.10 also Is to go
to conference, probably tomorrow.
And it Is conceded in official circles
that the task of reconciling the dl
fenences all along the lino to secure
action by congress will ho a serious
one. Already the president has been
warned by the house leaders that
they resent his espousal of the sen
ate navy plans and he will have to
wave the big stick in most strenuous
fashion If he is to get the program
made effective on which he desires
to appeal to the country in the com
ing campaign.
Senate Rewrote 3 lea suit.
The defense budget, as it now
stands, including the fortifications
appropriations of $25,748,050 already
a law. totals $6S5. 343,017. 27. The
navy total is $31 5,8L'6,84 3.55, but,
while the senate raised the amount
only some forty millions in the ag
gregate, it practically rewrote the
entire measure and this is the chief
cause of complaint among the house
members. They are claiming that
the senate has been duped" by the
navy into planning a program that
benefits the "naval clique" rather
than the general service.
The first meeting of the conferees
on the naval bill was held today. It
was preliminary In character and it
was not believed that any real se
rious effort to reconcile these differ
ences would be attempted until af
ter the general outlook had been
thorough ly canvassed. It was made
very plain by ?en. Tillman that the
senate conferees are prepared to
stick out to the very last lor battle
ships as well as battle cruisers.
Wilson Confident.
Prcs't Wilson was said to be very
confident that the house will accept
the essentials of the senate pro
gram. He will throw the entire in
fluence of the administration behind
the senate committee and it is under
stood that he has been told that if
the latter will retire from the three
year plan and confine their legisla
tion to this year's authorization that
they will find the house conferees
inclined to make reasonable conces

LONDON. July 2-. The , ourt of
criminal --appeals sat especially this
morning to hear any possible appli
cation that might be made in behalf
of Sir Itoner Casement, who is under
sentence to be hanged on Aug. for
high treason. but none was made.
The same five justices who heard
Casement's appeal from the hißh
treason verdict sat today, with Jus
tice Darling presiding.
When the justices entered court
two letters were passed up to Jus
tice Darling. The presiding justice
then announced that the court had
assembled because it had been in
formed by a crown ot!i ial that Case
ment's counsel had notified him that
application would be made for on
sideration of some of the points men
tioned in Casement's notice of ap
peal which Alexander Sullivan, so
licitor for Casement, had not ar
gued. Mr. Sullivan stated publicly in
court that he had abandoned his in
tention because after careful con
sideration he had come to the con
clusion that he would n"t ask tlK
court to quash the conviction on
those grounds.
The statement of Mr. Suliivan w-s
not made verbally, but was contain
ed in a communication to the court
which was read by Justice Darling.
Justice Darline said h was not
surprised at Mr. Sullivan's action
as the court held the oppinion that
there was nothing in the points men
tioned. There was a suggestion that Mr.
Sullivan had not authority to aban
don the points without having judg
ment passed on their merits, but the
attitude taken by Casement's coun
sel was upheld by the justices.
