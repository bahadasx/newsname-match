WILSON NOTE
ON BLACKLIST

[Fruin The Trlbua. Burftu 1
Washington, July 27. -With the dis
patch of a note to Great Britain from
the State Department last night, con
troversy over the Britiah blacklist
passes from the international stage to
tbe range of domestic politics.
Although the communication is ad?
dressed to Ambassador Page for deliv?
ery to the London Foreign Office, and
follows all the rules of diplomatic
usage, in reality it is a document aimed
at the thousands of voters on thii aide
of the Atlantic who between now and
November must make up their minds
ns to tho merits or demerits of the
Wilson Administration.
For one accustumed to regarding the
foreign aiTairs of a nation aa aet apart
from the designs of politicians, as
something to bo deliberated on with an
irnpartiality akin to that of the Su?
preme Court, such a charge no doubt
will como as a rude shock. But for
one who has witnessed the changes in
Washington during the last week the
conclusion is unavoidable.
Nor is the charge a new one. Sus
picion haa been raised before that in?
ternational matters, like the "apology"
foi the Lusitania attack, responsibility j
for the Sussex affair, and the whole
Mexieaa situation, were being made to
serve the exigencies of Democratic and
White House politics. Now, the Brit
Ieh blacklist has been added to this (
class.
View of Blacklist Changea.
If there is doubt In the mind of any
that political strategy rather than the
pre. ervation of American rights die- I
tated the present note to Great Britain,
let him but consider the case of the
blacklist aa it has developcd during the
last week. To appreciate it properly, he
must have in mind also the various
other complaints which our government
has pending against Knpland: The
whole question of the legality of the;
blockade, the detention of American
ships and cargoea, the seizure of
American mails, the infringement of
virtually every American eommereial
right that touches on the sea.
When the British blacklist of Ameri?
can firms accused of trading with the1
OBOmy was published, although there
WBfl a great outcry from the, individuals
affected, it was conceded by the State
Departaaeat that England was within |
her rights. There was some concern as
to the pcope of the prohihition and how
it mipht affect other American firms,
aad inquines were addressed to London
on the subject. In the meantime, every?
thing possible was done in negotia?
tions witli the Embassy to aid tho .
proscribed firma.
At the las*. Cabinet meeting Acting
Secretary Polk is understood to have
declared that any protest by the I'nited
States, if it were to have flobfltantial
weight, must be based on more facts
than were now at hand. Finally, the
triple a.ssurances of the British Am
lOT that the blacklist was an
order only to British firms, that exist
ir.g eoatraeta were not invalidated, and
that it was not aimed at neutrals,
seemed to clear away, Bfl State Iiepart
ment officiais theauelTei admittod, the
last grounds of mss understandmg.
Enter the Politician.
Then Bflddealy, almost overnight, the
situation changed. With that stealth
praetiaed by all "gum shoe gentlemen,"
tha politieian enters. It is announced
that a note is to be sent to (ircat

Secretary llaker's order permitting tho
discharge of men with dependent rela
tiveg in order to return to New York
to resume the support of their fami
lifB.
Announcement was made at the head?
quarters of the Lastern Department
yesterday that a standard regulation
of the War Department providei that,
inasmuch as a Guardsman becomes a
civilian at the time he is mustered out,
anv travelling he may plan to do there
after must be at his own expense.
I'overty Holds Men.
In addition to the railroad fare from
Texas to New York the discharged
soldier will have to pay for his sleep
ir.g accommodations and his food dur?
ing the tnp, bnnging the total amount
close to $70.
In many cases, where families in
this city are practieally destitute and
dopending on the Active Service Aux-1
iliary or other similar organizations
for support, the sum is almost prohibi
tive and the breadwinner may find it
necetsary to remain with his regiment
while his relatives rely on charity.
Many letters have been received
from discharged men expressing sur?
prise that the government did not pay
their travelling expenses. It is likely
that the announcement of the nar
Department's stand will result in the
formation of a fund to bring the men
back to their families.
Half of Guard May Return.
Captain Kilbourne, of Ger.r-rai.
Wood's r-tatT. said that if the amend?
ment providing l'or the release of
every man under twenty-one in the
National Guard and tho regular army
who enlisted without the consent of
his parents or guardian. vhich whi
adopted by the Senate on Wednesday,
is passed by the Houso more than
half tho National Guard will he re?
leased.
"Ahout half the National Guard
foi,-.*-, aro undor twenty-one,"' said
("aptain Kilbourne. "In tho regular
army the number is r.ot so great.
Many of these men had their parents'
ron?ent to enlist, but if the amend?
ment is adopted a tremendous per
cen'age of the troops will be dis?
charged."
"It is always the case that In an
army the greater part of the men are
under twenty-one. This was particu
larly true in both the trmies in tho
fivil War. While twenty-one has al?
ways been the lei-ai age, I am sure
many boys under that have said they
were twonty-one in order to get into
the army "
At the Division Headnuarters of tho
Now York National Guard it was said
that the nmendment would not affeet
the Guard of this s'ate, as the conser.t
of every man's parents a>r guardian
had been received before the man was

One man was killed, two were fatally injured and three others

While doctors and policemen were struggling to pull the
dead and injured from the wreckage three other cars. unoccu

the first car. Just as the last injured man had been lifted
clear of the debris the first of the runaway cars ploughed into
the wreckage.

It was followed, at intervals of only a few seconds, by tho

house company, said that there were
ftored in tne building 750 van-loads of
furniture. Most of it wa? the property

easily worth $75<i,0O0. Bernard Loth,

Sheriff Halt . All Cara.
Early last evening the rioting strik?
ers began to surge through the matu
thoroughfares of The Bronx, throwing
rocki at the cars which crept past
under the control of the green motor?
men, pulling trolley poles from tho
wires and even tirinff a few shots.
By 9 o'clock Sheritf O'Brien of the
Bronx begged thfl I'nion Railway to
avoid almost certain disaster by stop
ping al! its cars. His request was not
obeyed until midnight, when the crash
came which will cause three deathi.
By that time there had been n aeora
or more of minor injuries, and at least
a hundred arrests made in the turbu
lent ranks of the strikers.
Threats were freely made by union
leaders that a eonsiderable part of the
Manhattan lines might be tied up be.
fore night. They also declared that
they could cripple car service in tho
entire city within a week.
From di-ybreak until almost midnight
every important corner and transfer
point held its knot of struggling men;
streetcars mar.ned by itrikebreakeri
whirled infrequently by in a storm of
brick. end abuse, and thousands of
residents of The Bronx trudged many
miles afoot rather than risk their livefl
by riding in the few cars in operation.

poiice station, had fifty reserves scat

strikers ar.d their sympathizers from.
wrecking half a dozen cars and smash
ing the windows and pummelling tha
crews of as many more. Twelve ar?
rests were made.
