SOUTH SIDE BRIDGE
REPISJDEIM
Steel Was in Worse Condi
tion Than It Was Ex
pected to Be.
The condition of the old Bteel that
has been taken from the South Side
bridge shows that the structure was
In a more dangerous condition than
was originally supposed. Many of the
old steel beams that supported the
sidewalk were found to be rusted en
tirely through and were only held in
place by the timbers that were nailed
to their sides. When separated the
timbers these beams will not support
the weight of a man without breaking
or bending.
Pine lumber is being used instead of
oak in constructing the new;sidewalks
that are being placed in the structure,
as it Is the opinion of the street com*
missioner that this lumger which is
saturated with pine pitch and resin
will last probably as long as creosoted
wood.
The work of replacing the sidewalkB
probably will not be completed until
the last of next week. Yesterday one
0 fthe laborers employed on the work
slipped from the old steel beam on
which he was standing and narrowly
missed the'ninety foot fall to Coal
Run. By pitching forward and catch
ing an adjoining beam he saved him
self. The work is somewhat retarded
b the enormous amount of splinters
the men get in their hands handling
the pine lumber. Two of the men did
not work this morning and stated that
they had remained at home to pick
out the splinters. The hot weather
causes their handB to become soft and
sweaty thus being especially suscepti
ble of picking up splinters.
