GREATER NEWSPAPER EXPENSE
From Kansas City Star, July 27.
Newspapers generally have assumed
that the public was not interested in
their business arrangements Such an
unprecedented situation has arisen,
however. In connection with the ad
vance in the cost of print paper and
for that matter, of practically every
thing that enters into newspaper pro
duction that newspapers all over the
country are being compelled to make
readjustment of advertising and sub
scription rates to meet the new condi
tions. White paper is the chief item of ex
pense in newspapers of general cir
culation, and in the last few months
its? price has advanced 20 per cent, 60
per cent, and even in some cases 100
per cent. For metropolitan newspa
pers this means an added cost of pro
duction of several hundred thousand
dollars a year. The advance in other
materials, while not so great, is very
material, and increases the gravity of
the problem.
The magazines are feeling the same
pressure. The August issue of the
World's Work, for instance, devotes
considerable space to the nn ii,..
tion. while Life, the Independent andjto th
. ' ' nv explained to
their readers the necessity of changes
in their circulation schemes because
of the emergency.

The Lewis gun, tne invention ui m
American army officer, was turned

ment "r.rfat Britain adopted it after
the war began and it is now recognized
as the greatest macnine gun ever in

Police and Strikers Clash In
N. Y.; Street Cars Wrecked.
Union Leaders to Tie Up All
Lines in Great City.
New York. July 28. The national
organization of the street railway em
ployes today continued efforts to
aU the motormen and con
ductors of New York city. Its leaders
predicted that, if the street railway
company did not yield to their de
mands in the Bronx and 'Westchester
county, the strike in those districts
would spread throughout the city.
Officers of the carmen's organiza
tion said arrangements for the fight
in Xew York has been in progress for
several months and that a fund of
$750,000 was on hand in case of
tieup of the subway, elevated and sur
face lines.
After a day marked by rioting and
bloodshed, the operation of cars in
the Bronx was suspend-id at 9 o'clock
last night. The police made nearly
100 arrests yesterday and more than
100 persons were injured in clashes
between strikers, rioters and the po
lice. No attempt has been made to
fasten on the strikers blame for the
fatal accident that occurred in the
Bronx late last night. In this accident
a strike breaker, acting as motorman
was killed and two policemen and

Chief Inspector Max Schmittberger,
announced this morning that in antici
pation of trouble more than SOD re
serves were being held in readiness
in three Bronx districts. During the
forenoon there were intermittent
clashes between strikers and carmen
and on several occasions the police
were forced to use their night sticks.
IN A TRAP AT LAST!
Capture of Villa by Defaetos Im
minent, Reports Capital.
Mexico City. July 28. Pancho Villa
is being driven Into a trap. Ten
thousand Carranza troops are driving
him and his capture is imminent, ac
cording to officials here. The an
nouncement was made in reply to
rumors from the United States border
that the bandit chief is moving to
ward Torreon.
"Such a story is ridiculous," it was
stated today by a high official. "Villa
cannot move south." -
Reply to Carranza's note suggesting
a joint commission for settlement of
the border difficulties is expected
hourly from the United States.
"Settlement of certain matters," ac
cording to the view of officials, is
probably delaying it. In the mean
while, Mexico City, expects the Ameri
can expeditionary force will be with
drawn, thus avoiding discussion on
this point when the conference be
tween the Mexican and American com
missioners begin.
A NEW BOMB SUSPECT
Police Believe They Have Leader of
Frisco Anarchist Gang.
San Francisco, July 28. Thomas J.
Mooney, a labor agitator, arrested
with his wife, in connection with the
preparedness parade bomb explosion,
case, was the leader of a gang re
sponsible for the explosion, according
police who are proceeding
on the theory that the bomb
was intended primarily for a body of
united railroad car men that marched
in the parade.

DEUTSCHLAND STILL WAITS
Germans Scont Stories That
Sister Ship Is Taken.
Fear British Steamers Will
Ram Under Sea Liner.
New York, July 28. Another cir
cumstantial report regarding the
whereabouts of the German merchant
super-submarine Bremen long ex
pected at some American port. Is that
the ship has been captured by Brit
ish patrolling squadrons and is to
day tied up In the harbor of Halifax,
N. S.
The report of the capture which is
published here today is given In a let
ter said to have been written by the
secretary of a high Canadian official
to a business man of this city. The
letter is declared to have been mailed
from Buffalo, N. Y., two days ago. It
was written in confidence it is stated,
but the information it contains was
divulged by the recipient to a friend
in the course of an argument as to
whether or not the Bremen could pass
through the British barrier.
The letter says:
"You seem in New York to be wor
ried about the Bremen. There la really
no cause for worry, for at the pres
ent time' she is tied up in what we
call the Northwest Arm in the har
bor of Halifax and Is being well taken
care or.
Portland Hears Report.
Portland, Me.. July 28. A telegram
saying the German underwater mer
chantman Bremen had been captured
and was being towed into Halifax was
received in this city today from a
Canadian source which was believed to
be reliable.
BV CARL D. GROAT.
Baltimore, Md.. July 28. Watchers
aboard the German sub-sea freighter
ieutseniand want to see the ships of
England go.
They fear that a plan is on foot to
have vessels In ballast in the harbor
follow the Deutschland out to the
capes and "accidentally" ram her.
This would save the allied mtmi a
ig tasn ana as one or Germans put
it, the . British could say, "Oh. -I beg
pardon: I will pay you damaien."
This fear Is believed to be one of
the compelling motives behind orders
to Geiay the Deutschland s departure.
The Bremen, however. Is a vital fac
tor. Ptories that she has been cap
tured brought the comment from a
Deutschland official today:
Don't Believe Bremen Lost.
"Bah, she is not lost until three or
four weeks.
He added that the Deutschland's sis
ter ship is too clever to fall into the
meshes of the Allied patrol.
All was peaceful along the Patap
sco today. A persistent screen of
mystery still haunted the situation.
There had been a long party aboard
the Neckar at the Deutschland pier;
some of the crew had individual
parties ashore, rolling in during the
early hours.
But no one connected with the
sub-sea venture would reveal when
the Deutschland's ends. The forty
eight hours since the Deutschland
cleared, expired this afternoon but
under local port rules It was found
that the vessel need not reclear, as
supposed, except in case she alters her
cargo. This is still being trimmed
as there is a certain unevenness that
might be annoying later.
Excitement Over Rumor.
Ottawa. Ont.. July 28. What the
naval department described later as
an unfounded report that the Ger
man submarine freighter Bremen had
been captured off Halifax, created ex
citement here today. No one knew
where the rumor originated.
Report Dented at Halifax.
St. John, July 28. J. D. Hazen,
minister of marine and fisheries, to
day denied reports that the German
undersea liner Beremen had been cap
tured and taken to Halifax. Halifax
reports received also declared the Bre
men was not there.
FRAUD IN U. S. OFFICE

Chicago, July 28. Irregularities in
volving thousands of dollars have
been discovered in the offices of the
internal revenue service in Chicago.
Three-fold investigation in under
way. Already grafting by deputies and
shortages in accounts of half a dozen
clerks, ranging from $25 to $1,000,
are said to have been disclosed.
John I. Shapiro, a deputy collector
under the chief of local revenue
agents, was taken on a charge of us
ing his position to extort money from
saloonkeepers.

Kansas City, Mo., July 28. The

Lima, O., July 28. At the opening

company reduced all grades of Ohio,
Indiana and Illinois crude oil 10 cents

from the incomes of oil operators in
these states.
A BACKWARD STEP
Probable That City Will Not
Buy Auto Fire Track.
Despite Department Needs,
Budgets Are Cut.
COMFORT STATION IS 0. K.
Mayor Honse Will GItc In to
Porter on the Budget. '
After This, City's Estimates
Will Be Settled.
Either Mayor House's request for
a new motor truck. In the fire depart
ment or Commissioner Porter's com
fort station must be killed to make
the $7,847.89 cut necessary In getting
the general fund budget inside a 4
mill levy. That was the opinion of
practically all the city commissioners
today. All the budget requests be
sides those of House and Porter are
in the clear. The mayor and Porter
said today they would have a confer
ence late this afternoon and decide
what is to be eliminated to get the
budget down.
"I suppose it is up to Porter and me
to make the cuts," Mayor House said
today. "It's going to be a hard
proposition, but I am not claiming the
town will go to the dogs If I don't get
my raises. We need the new motor
car in the fire department and the
policemen should have their raise. I
have always contended that one piece
of motor apparatus should be added
to the fire department each year until
the horse-drawn vehicles are abolish
ed. On the other hand, I am strongly
in favor of Porter's comfort station."
In Conciliatory Mood.
In stating his position on the nec
essary cut, Mr. Porter did not allow
the mayor to get ahead of htm. "I
think I ean make several little cuts,"
he said. "I also do not belieev the
town is going to be ruined if I don't
get what I want. I need my comfort
station and House needs the raise for
his cops and the new piece of fire ap
paratus. I think we will be able to
settle it."
It was forecast around the city hall
that the mayor would eliminate the
request for a fire truck In preference
to the station. That, it is pointed out,
will leave Porter with his comfort
station and House with his raise for
the cops.
Thursday after the city commission
ers had all agreed to cut Commissioner
Tandy's special bridge levy to the
tent of 13,819.38,- to get the special
assessment fund down to $229,693.38
in a morning session, Tandy walked
into a late afternoon session and talk
ed them tnto cutting the sinking fund
down that amount. His recommenda
tion was adopted and he will get the
half-mill levy for bridges.
FIND MORE EVIDENCE
Search Discloses Second Instrument In
Girl Murder Mystery.
Olney, 111., July 28. Portions of a
second catheter, which authorities be
lieve Hinterliter used In hie attempt
to perform an illegal operation on
Elizabeth RatclifCe, were found today
near the place where it, is believed
the girl died.
The finding of the portions started
anew the most minute search over the
ground In the vicinity. Sheriff West
is being aided in this search by the
two brothers of Miss Ratcliffe, who
came here from Indiana after the
burial of their sister on Monday.
The brothers are very anxious to
collect evidence that will fix the crime
upon some one, and are untiring in
their efforts to unearth something
new.
The authorities have intimated for
several days that another catheter ex
isted and the finding of the portions
today caused local citizens to believe
the state has some conclusive evi
dence of Hinterliter's guilt which it
is withholding until the proper time.
Girl Lured to Spot?
As new facta came in whispered
stories from Elizabeth's girl friends,
they revealed a deliberate conspiracy
to lure the girl to the lonely spot
where she died. They present a more
horrible story than has been suspected
ever by Hinderliter's accusers.
The revelations of Elizabeth's
friends were pieced together to show
that her young farmer lover had
soothed the agony of her fears of dis
grace by promising a midnight meet
ing on the isolated country road with
two physicians who were to direct the
operation necessary to destroy the evi
dence of her unwise love.
These stories tend to show that
Hinderllter then persuaded two of his
"Texas" friends to take the roles of
the supposed physicians and that when
they quailed at the last moment at the
prospect of witnessing the girl's suf
fering, Hinderllter did not give up his
plan, but, instead, carried it out alone.
Did Boy Friends Pose as Doctors?
These boys, said to be Earl Berry
and C. S. Jones, have Just about talk
ed themselves into jail. Sheriff West
said last night:
"They have told so much about their
part in the affair that their friends
are already calling Jones, 'Doc' Jones.
It is a ghastly Joke and if the state's
attorney will allow it, I will bring both
of them in with me tonight."

proposition of an interurban line be
tween hre and Holton.
Several business men here have
agreed to put $1,000 each into the

the proposed line have promised to

Washington, July 28. Informal as
surances that Austria-Hungary Is dis
posed to respond favorably to Presi
dent Wilson's appeal for permission
ior snipment or American relier sup
plies to Poles In territory held by
Austrian forces have been given per
sonally by Foreign Minister Burlan to

Mr. Penfield reported today that he
delivered personally to Count von
Burlan on July 26 President Wilson's
plea in behalf of famine stricken Poles
and the foreign minister promised to

mediately to Emperor Francis Joseph.
The minister's unofficial opinion -was
that the request of the president

Railroad Brotherhoods Beady
to Meet Operators Aug. 1.
Tote Simply Authorizes Com
mittee to Take Action.
Cleveland, O., July 28. The four
railway brotherhoods today notified
the railroads' committee that they are
prepared to resume conferences on an
eight-hour day at ten-hour pay and
time-and-a-half for' overtime on Au
gust 1, In New York. The brotherhood
officials hope for a satisfactory set
tlement of the demands, previously
refused by the railroads.
S The brotherhood officials will go in
to the conference backed up with the
power of the referendum vote of 360,-
000 railway employes to "act as thev
deem best" in case the deadlock can
not be broken by agreement.
A statement from brotherhood
headquarters said:
"The vote does not necessarily mean
a strike but only authorizes the chief
executives of the four brotherhoods to
call a strike 'provided' a satisfactory
settlement cannot be obtained from
the railroads.
' "The ballots are sealed in envelopes
by the Individual members, and no one
knows what the vote is until It is
opened by the brotherhoods' commit
tee In New York August 1. Any an
nouncement before that time as to
the result of the vote Is only a guess."
BOON TO FARMER
Hot Weather Fine for Corn,
Says C S. Bureau.
Potatoes and Tolmcco Suiter lor
Lack of Rain.
Washington, July 28 The sustained
heat of the past ten days, registering
record high marks throughout the
middle west, was a boon to tho corn
farmer, according to the United
States Department of Agriculture.
"Corn crops," says the government
experts, "are progressing very satis
factorily and are tassel ing as far north
as the Ohio valley in the east, and
Minnesota and North Dakota in the
west."
More rain must come within the
next two or three weeks, however, or
acording to the government crop
men, the corn crop will suffer. This
Is the critical period for the crop.
Truck gardening crops, including po
tatoes and tobacco, have suffered from
the intense heat throughout the cen
tral and northern states.
The temperature was too high for
spring wheat in North Dakota and
Minnesota and some rust has devel
oped in North Dakota, South Dakota
and Minnesota.
The weather conditions were favor
able for haying over the northern part
of the United States. The lack of rain,
says the department, is adversely af
fecting vegetation on the Rocky moun
tains and central great- plains region
and in the central valley states.
FOUR INCHES OF LAND
Mew York Bank Brings Suit to Quiet
Title on Space.
New York, July 28. To clear the
title to four inches of ground on
Broadway bankruptcy proceedings ten
years, old have been re-opened against
Feter Banner, one time wealthy real
estate operator. He became bank
rupt In 1906. Previously he gave
mortgages on No. 48 Broadway to
the Union Dime Savings bank for
$300,000, to the Broadway Trust com
pany tcr $60,000. All actions in bank
ruptcy were later dropped but Banner
was never discharged by the court.
Today the Union Dime Savings bank
re-opened the proceedings because, it
is alleged, the mortgage given to the
Broadway Trust company and exer
cised years ago by a foreclosure sale,
emits the mention of four Inches be
tween the northerly wall of the build
ing and the limit of the site.
The bank wants to foreclose on the
entire property but cannot do so be
fore the four inches unaccounted for
in the mortgage first foreclosed has
been administered in bankruptcy.

IT'S 3-BARRELLED
Hughes Speech To Be Based on
Trio of Charges.
Political "Eyes and Ears of
Capital" Await Monday.
HUGHES IS JOJE NOTIFIED
His Reply Will Be Keynoter
for Fall Campaign.
Chairman Willcox's . Statement
Considered a Forecast.
Washington, July 28. Administra
tion leaders have their political eyes
and ears turned toward next Monday.
On that day Charles E. Hughes will
receive official notification of his
nomination for president and will re
ply with an address marking the open
ing of his campaign.
Those close to the president say they
are not "worried" about what the for
mer Justice may say. Nevertheless
they are certainly "keenly interested."
They believe the speech will be di
vided into three main features:
A criticism of the president's Mexi
can policy and foreign policy.
General charges that the Demo
cratic party Is unable to cope with the
business upheavals bound to come
after the war.
Appeal for the restoration of the
Republican party to power "to bring
a return of respect abroad and business-like
administration at home."
Wilson Already "Loaded.''
The president has not waited for
Hughes' speech to prepare his own
address of acceptance. He has been
working on it for some time. One
of his intimate friends expressed the
Belief today that the first draft was
completed, subject to change should
the Republican candidate spring any
surprises. Senator James, who will
notify the president of his nomination.
is, however, waiting on Hughes' speech
Monday before outlining what he will
say at the notification meeting In
New Jersey.
Will Break News on Mexico.
New York. July 28. First formal
indication that Mexico will be the main
issue on which the Republicans will
attack the Wilson administration In
the presidential campaign was con
tained in a statement issued today by
National Chairman Willcox.
The statement denied the Repub
lican party's criticism of the handling
of the Mexican problem was "dic
tated" by any sinister influence, and
bitterly assailed Wilson's "maladmin
istration of affairs there." - .- -
The Willcox statement was a fol
lows:
"AU statements made in newspapers
or elsewhere to the effect that the at
titude of the Republican party towards
the situation in Mexico is dictated by
any sinister influence, corporate or
otherwise, are contrary to the facts.
Our interest in Mexican affairs is '"ie
result solely and exclusively of the
maladministration of American rela
tions with Mexico and the various
Mexican factions.
Mexico Is a Vital Issue.
"The weakness of the Wilson ad
ministration in deailing with the
Mexican question is so fully before the
American people that it Is a vital is
sue In this campaign.
"It is therefore not impossible for
the Democratic party to evade the re
sponsibility for conditions an Mexico
I by ascribing ulterior motives. The is
I sue is plain and clear cut. It is the

SOKHOMLINOFF INSANE
Former Russian Minister of War Ser
iously 111 at Petrograd.
Petrograd, July 28. General Vladi
mir Sukhomhnoff, former Russian
minister of war, is seriously 111. It is
feared that he is afflicted with insan
ity. General Sukhomllnoff, who s now
in his sixtieth year, is awaiting trial
for treason. He is a man of unusual
military gifts, but allowed himself to
be influenced by people of the adven
ture type, to his eventual undoing.
While at Kieff, it is alleged, he was
very friendly with Kiliabko Bogroff
(the murderer of Stolypin) and
Myasoedoff (hanged last year lor be
traying Russian plans to Germany).
When General Sukhomllnoff moved
to Petrograd and took over the post
of minister of war he was followed by
a majority of his Kieff satellites.
Among them was Myasoedott, in
whom he appears to have reposed the
greatest confidence and to have com
municated to him many of the secrets
of the department he was administer
ing. A considerable share of the respon
sibilities of Russia's unpreparedncss is
attributed to the general.

RELIEF FARTHER OFF
The
Chance for Rain Is Growing
Less Day by Day.
Kansas sweltered again today under
a copper sky and the weather man
has announced that the chances of
rain and relief from the hot weather
are remote. The longer It stays dry,
according to S. D. Flora, local ob
server, the less chance there is of local
showers and we will have to wait for
a general change all over the country.
No rain fl anywhere in Kansas last
night and temperatures were high
over the entire state. The wind,
which made from 10 to 12 miles an
hour yesterday, promised to afford
some relief again today but this morn
ing it wis thought that the mercury
would ciimD to tne century mark.
Last night was the warmest this
year with one exception. The mer
cury at 7 o'clock In the evening
showed 93 degrees and at o clock
this morning the reading was 74 de
grees. This is 6 degrees above the
normal night temperature for thia
date. The highect reading Thursday
was 97 degrees. The forecast calls
for generally fair weather with con
tinued high temperatures tonight and
Saturday.
The longer it stays dry the moro
wind will blow and this will give
some nope to Kansana who are anx
lously watching the weather. The
wind, however, is the worst thing pos
sible for the corn as It dries the
ground more rapidly. The Kaw river
is at a standstill today at a stage of
5.6 feet
The highest temperature on record
for this date is 106 degrees, estab
lished In 1910. The low record, 60
degrees occurred in 1891. On July
28, 1902, a rain of 1.83 Inches was
recorded

Account of Heat.
Chicago, July 28. Workmen in the
rolling mills of the Republic Iron and
Steel company and the Interstate Iron
and Steel company refused to go to
work on account of the Intense heat
this morning and as a result both
mills were closed. It is expected that
employes of other mills will protest
against working under the present
heat conditions also. Temperatures
in the rolling mills a few days ago
ranted from 140 to 160 dearees.
Fitful winds from the lake gave
Chicago and other lake cities a meas
ure of relief today, the temperature
at noon here being 95.

MANY DIE FROM
TERRIFIC HEAT
WAVEJN WEST
Twenty-Six Tictims Burin?;
Sweltering Night in Chicago.
No Letup to High Temperatures
Sweeping Prairie States.
HOT SPELL SMOTHERS BABIES
Total Number of 47 Peaths Re
ported All OTer Country.
In for a Nice Warm Spely
Says Weather Man.
Chicago, July 2S. Twenty-six per
sons died here during the night aa a
result of the terrific heat wave whicn
has been sweeping prairie states the
last two weeks, reports to the coro
ner's office slated today. This brings
the total number of dead in Chicago
as a result of the heat up to 44 wltnln
the last 24 hours.
The tetal number of victims waa
swelled to 47 with reports from Mln
reapclla. Rock Island and Phoenix,
Arix., of one dead at each place from
the heat.
No relief was promised today.
The prediction for the middle west
was "fair and continued high tempera
ture." Business houses are planning
to close their stores an hour earlier.
So intense was the heat today that
contractors would not let laborers
work for fear of heat prostration.
The health department Issued bul
letins warning mothers to watch the
milk served their babies. Milk deal
ers were warned they would lose their
milk license If their milk waa not pas
teurized. Thousands of tons of ice
were given away in the poor districts
here In an effort to bring relief.
Lowest in Boston and Frisco.
At El Paso, Tex., and Brownsville
the thermometer registered 88 and
San Antonio showed only 86, while
at Freeport, 111., the mercury climbed
to 101 In the shade, beating heat rec
ords for the last twenty-five years. At
New Orleans the temperature was 90.
The lowest temperatures for the day
were recorded at Boston and San
Francisco. Their thermometers regis

No Hope Says Weather Man,
- Washington, July 28. The weather
bureau today held out a little hope to
the middle west that the terrific heat
of the past few days might soon come
to an end but any hope for that sec
tion is at the expense of the Atlantic
seaboard.
There is 100 degree weather in sight
along the coast, it is declared. And
this will mean greater suffering than
has been felt in the middle west,
where, for the most part, the humidity
has been low. A series of thunder
storms presaged by the increasing
heaviness of the atmosphere In the
Mississippi valley may break the
tropic bpell it is believed. If it does
not the weather that has been ruining
crops in the country and smotheing
babies in the cities is likely to con
tinue. The northwest shows no at
mospheric conditions that would aid
to bring about the prayed-for change
this side of the Rockies.
Bermuda High.
At the weather bureau the blame te
placed on "Bermuda high." That ie
a way of saying the area of high
pressure air over Bermuda and the
surrounding Atlantle is largely re
sponsible for keeping the weather
elsewhere hot. This area of high pres
sure air has prevented tne hot cur
rents from the mainland from mov
ing out to sea. Even the Pacific coast
is not to be exempt from suffering It
was said today and may expect aa

White, who, as secretary of the United
States embassy in London in 1903 un
der Secretary Hay, conducted the
negotiations, for the purchase of the
Danish West Indies for $5,000,000, waa
asked at the golf links today to make a
statement concerning the failure of
the Danish government to ratify the
sale at that time. He said:
"The lower chamber of the rigsdaa
I at Denmark agreed to the negotiations
oy a large vote out tne upper cum
ber was a tie. One member of the
upper chamber was absent and ill. He
was taken to the government house in
a special train and cast the deciding
vote against the proposed sale.
"You will find the record of my
negotiations in my report. You must
understand my position not to discuss
the reasons why the purchase failed.
It would not be diplomatic either, and
especially Just now with the renewal
of the negotiations for the purchase
of the islands.'
