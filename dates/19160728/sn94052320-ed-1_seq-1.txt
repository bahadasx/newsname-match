Feeding pen for the little chicks

Injury to them by the older fowls.
You can tell a laying hen as far as
you can aee ber. Her comb Is always
bright and healthy looking.
If you do not Intend to use hen for
hatching, break them up at once and
get them to laying again.
When the hens are laying regularly
more food should be supplied and with
more food comes the necessity of
more exercise.",'. .
When chicks or hens are confined In
small yards. It la best to feed little
and often in order to keep the birds
busy and contented.
Never grease the ben that la setting,
ss grease getting on the sheila of the
eggs will close the pores and smother
Ue chickens.
Poultry yards should have shade for
chickens during the summer. If your
hen do not have shade, plant trees
ror this purpose.
Make It s point to keep the chicks
busy scratching.' Scatter flue grains
(u the litter, and by scratching It out
they will get the exercise necessary
ito good health. -
Don't relax feeding the young chicks
during the hot summer months, be
cause you think there la plenty of
grass and bugs for them. They; need
