f CELEBRATION
CJwcrvnnce of the Day in Cedar
- City Calls Forth Much Fu
ji I vorable Comment.
y PARADE WAS PLEASING
f FEATURE OF EXERCISES
I
f A Number of Visitors From Other
?' Parts of County, but Not so
Many 'aB Were Expected.
t
? It appears to be the concensus of
''' opinion that the celebration of tho
C- 24th, Pioneer Day, in Cedar City last
Monday was n pronounced success.
t,' From tho parade in tho morning to
tho grand ballot night, everything
f went off smoothly, and tho great ma-
L jority of the people appear to feel
' that they obtained their money's
f" t worth.
I The parade, representing the cvolu-
1 tion of travel, was especially merit-
orious, there being n number of very
t- beautiful and ingenious floats. The
f five dollar prize offered by the com-
i mittee was divided between the Bec-
' , hive and scgo lily floats, the former
being prepared under tho direction of
' the Beehive girls and the latter by
K' Mr. Frank Wilson. The purse offered
! for the best decorated bicycle was al-
l bo divided, being placed 50-50 on the
i wheels decorated and ridden by Henry
I Webster and Miss Alice Higbee.
i There was represented in the pro-
J1 cession, also, tho primitive hand-cart,
f between the shafts of which a goodly-
I number of the Mormon pioneers
p . crossed the great plains to the valleys
of the Rockies, the early ox-team,
which also played an important part
in tho immigration to this country,
the natives, with their primative mode
j& of travel, a huge freight truck, .load
of "Utah's best crop" tho children,
!,-- - a company of Boy Scouts, in uniform
p.- and bearing arms, clowns on burros
r . and bicycles, some elaborate floats by
local business houses, etc. All to-
' . gether, the parade for an inland com
munity was very creditable.
i The blasting on the mountain side
created quite a little commotion, and
; raised clouds of dust which momen
tarily resembled the outbreak of a
af young volcano.
R . The Parowan band, under the direc-
S tion of Mr. Ecckles was present and
j. mingled with tho Cedar City band
f members at the head of the proces-
L- sion.
p, Tho tabernacle was thronged to
fe . the doors with people at the morning
jL meeting, which was pithy and full of
Sp " interest from start to finish.
P&', Attorney Chas. G. Y. Higgins was
$f- orator of tho day, and delivered an
J' interesting and patriotic address.
jflf-; Mrs. J. U. Webster gave a very
v! - interesting reading.
jr. There were two selections by tho
W , Cedar City double mixed quartet, and
, other musical numbers wedo a solo,
, ffi "The Flag Without a Stain" by Miss
. m , Pearl Uric, and a chorus by the Bee-
! ftffy- hive Girls.
j w) E. J. Palmer acted as chaplain.
".; The exercises were short, but pithy,
p which was quite agreeable to tho as-
fr, . sembly, aB the building was crowded
j , and the weather quite warm,
j i, The principal feature of the after
noon sports was the ball games. Tho
. , Parowan Boy Scouts, in a game com
mencing at 1 p. m., defeated tho Ce-
&. dar Boy Scouts nine.
i The first two or three innings of
L v the ball game between Cedar City
I 0-' and Lund teams was fairly even, al-
f though slightly in favor of the boys
!" from the dry farming section; but
I then tho Cedar team grew nervous
i und loBt their balance, with tho re
sult that the boys from Lund waltzed
home the victors on a score of 0 to 1.
It is a long time since we have seen
the local bunch play as poor ball.
', With only one or two exceptions, the
t whole team appeared to be on the
bum. Wo believe it will have a good
ta effect, howovor, as it will make the
YV boys know that if they expect to win
J V back and hold the championship of
V1 yk even this county, they will have to
IVi ' Kingcr up" and "play ball." v
Tho lads from Lund certainly put
1 up a strong match and gave evidence
of a thorough knowledge of tho game.
y 1 After tho ball gamo thero was an
1 automobile race commencing about
- half way down tho West lane and
1 ending in front of W. H. Corry's res-
idenco on First North street. Thoro
were only two contestants, a Maxwell
and a Ford, the former driven by Mr.
Ashton of Salt Lake City and tho lat
ter by Percy Wilkinson of this city.
The Ford driven by Wilkinson won
by a lead of a few paces.
At 3 o'clock the old people wore
collected and taken to the B. A. C.
campu3, where they were entertained
in accordance with tho program pub
lished in our last Issue, and a good
time was reported.
Tho ball in the evening was well
attended, there being quite a number
of visitors present from other parts
of the county, though not so many ns
were expected.
SEE PARLEY DALLEY FOR
LIVING ACCOMMODATIONS.
Students and other persons desiilnir
n-pomniodations for the winter should
see or address Mr. Parley Dalley,
Cedar City, Utah; and persons hav
ing rooms to rent, desiring boarder?
or" having other accommodations to
offer should report same to Mr. Dal
ley, who will bo intrusted with the
work of handling this matter.
Mr. Dalley states that while it is
imperative that all the people who
can furnish accommodations for stu
dents und others who desire to come
hero for the winter, still he does not
anticipate any serious famine for ac
commodations, and he feels certain
that he will be ablo to supply the demands.
Owing to the addition of one year
of college work, it is expect
ed that there will be a record attend
ance at the school this year, and ev
erything looks propitious for an ex
ceptionally interesting and success
ful school year.
Students coming hero from the
surrounding districts will receive a
hearty welcome from the townspeo
ple, as well as the faculty and "resi
dent students.
IDAHO CITIZENS
DEFEND HIGOINS
Certify to Good Character, Forceful-
ness and Success of Attorney
While Public Prosecutor.
Some few weeks since an article was
printed in an Idaho weekly paper of
Bear Lake county, and given more or
less circulation in this judicial dis
trict, reflecting upon the legal attain
ments of Attorney Will B. Higgins,
who was county attorney one term of
that county and who is now a candi
date for tho district attorneyship of
this tho Fifth district. The matter
being brought to the attention of Mr.
Higgins, he wrote to some of the
prominent people of Paris, Idaho, at
which place he had his residence, for
a statement of the true conditions re
specting his tenure in office, and tho
following sworn statement was tho
result:
"State of Idaho, County of Bcnr
Lake, ss.
"We, the undersigned, hereby cer
tify as follows:
"That wo arc and have been for
several years acquainted with William
B. Higgins. That for about two years
he was county attorney of Bear Lake
county, Idaho, und that during that
time he made his home in Paris,
Idaho. That Mr. Higgins was a pro
gressive attorney of good character
and habits. That he was forceful and
successful in his work ns county at
torney nnd did much good in reducing
tho liquor traffic to a minimum in our
county. That he was always inter
ested in local problems for tho good
of the general community and was al
ways on hand to take any step to pro
moto tho moral standards of tho
county.
"We regurd him as being in that
class of young men out of which any
community could well afford to choose
and ought to choose their leaders and
officers. During tho time that Mr.
Higgins lived in our county from May
9th, 1910, until tho end of 1912, ho
was busy in his field of work and was
never afraid to take a stand for that
which was right nor to lend his time
and assistance to any good institution.

MODERN HOSPITAL
FOR jEJAR BIY
Dr. A. N. Leonard Closes Deal
for Palatial Residence of
Pres. U. T. Jones.
CONSIDERATION SAID
TO RE TEN THOUSAND
A Few Minor Alterations Will Make
it Ideal inEvery Respect for
Hospital Purposes.
An important real estate deal has
just been consummated by which tho
Southern Utah Hospital, owned nnd
directed by Dr. A. N. Leonard, will
secure a magnificicnt home. The
property secured is tho palatial resi
dence erected a few years since by
Pres. U. T. Jones, and which has boon
found to bo too largo and expensive
for his requirements.
With only a few minor alterations
the building will be idcnl for hospital
purposes and will give tho local in
stitution a homo that will place it in
a class by itself compared with the
other country hospitals of this state.
The change in management will go
into effect within the next few days,
as soon as the details of tho transac
tion can be worked out, and tho new
homo will soon be furnished nnd put
in shape for use.
Dr. Leonard, the ruling figure, has
already built up a considerable repu
tation for his surgical work, which
has been attended with unusual suc
cess, and with this splendid home for
his institution, and with his X-ray and
other up-to-dato enuinment. should
fill a big need in tho southern part of
the state, it being no longer necessary
to go to Salt Lake for oven major
surgery of any of the commoner vn
rictics.' s ' : 1 "'
Tho building just acquired is eas
ily tho peer of any residence proper
ty in this county, and probably this
would also apply to tho southern end
of the state. It is strictly modern,
especially substantial, and most con
veniently arranged. The building is
.surrounded by a tract of seven acres
of ground, which will be especially
welcome and valuable to convalescing
patients. '
That Mr. Jones should consent to
give up the magnificicnt property is
a surprise to all his friends and to tho
public generally. Tho only explana
tion given is- that tho manshion was
too large for his family and needs.
It is understood that tho considera
tion fs to be $10,000.00.
Mattson is n Candidate.
We are in receipt of a communica
tion this morning from Secretary of
State David Mattson, officially advis
ing us that ho is a candidate to suc
ceed himself in the office ho now
holds. So far as wo know Mr. Matt
son has been a good conscientious of
ficial, and should the plum fall to him
again, we feel sure that ho will bo
found in tho full discharge of his du
ty in the future as ho has in the past.
Thero will be at least tlucc candi
dates before the Republican stato con
vention for this office.
J. F. Delanoy, traveling truffle agent
for tho American Express company,
residing at Sacramento, California,
was in Cedar City last week en route
to Washington county to look into
tho feisability of making shipments of
Dixie fruits and other products by
express via Lund, Utah. Mr. Delaney
said that the express companies were
in a more prosperous condition since
the parcel post law went into effect
than they were before. Ho said that
while the parcel post business had cut
into them in some of the inland dis
tricts that they were very willing to
I bo relieved of this part of their busi-
ness, which had never been profitable,
land that on tho other hand their
business along the railroads had in

SPRY DEFEATED WELLS ON
TillRI) TERM IN RACE 1901.
(From Sandy City Star.)
It would bo rather amusing read
ing if Governor William Spry would
explain to the public why ho has so
abruptly changed fronts and is now
willing to accept and fight for tho ob
noxious third term us governor of the
stato of Utah when in 1901 ho was
stumping the state as ono of tho most
prominent speakers iu tho Republican
ranks denouncing tho third term
which Heber M. Wells was aspiring
for at that time.
His stand at that time was very
pronounced nnd highly patriotic in fa
vor of tho glorious principles of "equal
rights to all and specinl privileges to
none" and there are those who vividly
recall Mfo emphatic denunciation of
a man whoso principles of truo Amer
icanism were so corrupted as to bo
aspiring for a third term ns govern
or, when precedent had established
the second term ns amplo and the
limit of truo American endurance.
Ono really wonders if Governor
Spry has not been a faithful student
of Woodrow Wilson nnd is now fol
lowing his example and aspiring for
tho important position he once de
nounced. Wilson was elected on a platform
which was pledged to a single term
for the president of the United States,
but the glare of public position and
tho prestige it brings has reversed
his one-time positive pledge nnd he
now stands for a second term, which
ho once deplored.
Governor William Spry stands, in a
similar position. Ho has completely
reversed himself ana Is fighting for
tho third term which tho people of
tho state of Utah abhor.
We do not believe that tho people
of this fair stato have becomo so care
less of their rights and privileges that
they will stand for Willium Spry for
a third term and there is another
thing that we are certain they will not
stand for. And that is to give Bill
Spry another opportunity to beat
them out of state-wido prohibition.
ATTENDANCE OF
1200 IS PREDICTED
Officers in Charge of Citizens' Train
ing Camp at Fort Douglas Sec
Big Success Ahead.
(Special to The Record.)
Suit Lake City, July 20, 1910. War
department officials are making prepa
rations for an attendance of 1200 men
at tho Citizen's Military Training
Camp to be held at Fort Douglas,
Utah, August 21 to September 16.
Tho enrollment now is more than 580
and officials in charge believe thero
will bo little troublo in extending it
to the 1200 mark, as nearly a month's
timo yet remains in which applications
may bo made.
When 580 hnd been enrolled, tho
success of tho camp was assured, and
General Bell and Captain John B.
Murphy of Western Headquarters,
War Department, started the depart
ment machinory in action with a view
of making tho Fort Douglas camp ono
of tho best ever held in tho United
States.
Colonel Boll decided to send three
companies of crack Coast Artillery
from balexico, Cal., on the border, to
Fort Douglas, and their arrival is
expected within a week to ten days.
These troops will work with the citi
zen soldiers and will serve as models
in manual of arms, marching nnd gen
eral tactics.
Citizens in the intermountnin re
gion, outside of Salt Lake, with tho
exception of some of tho larger cit
ies, such as Donvor and Butte, are re
sponding daily to tho call for recruits.
Attendants at Camp will bo furn
ished transportation, clothes, food and
shelter. A deposit of $15 only is re
quired upon entrance to tho camp, $5
of which is returned in caso there is
no damage done to government prop
erty. Ton dollars goes toward extra
rations and for the payment of kitch
en help.

CHALMERS SIX30
MAKES RECORD
Clips Three Hours From the Previous
Road Record Between Dallas,
Texas, and San Antonio.
Clipping over three hours from tho
best nrcvious timo botween Dnllns
and San Antonio, a Chalmers Six-30
driven by W. W. Moriss, Jr., of Dallas,
Tovas, has just hung up the fifth fnst
national road record to bo captured
by a 8,100 R. P. M. Chalmers in the
past month.
According to a wiro received by
Paul Smith. Vice-President of the
Chalmers Selling Division, Moriss'
record wns made under conditions so
discouraging as to mako fnst travel
ing extremely dangerous.
"Checked out of Dallas by Clerk
Fred Meyers of the Adolphus Hotel,
wo made the three hundred and two
miles to San Antonio in nino hours
nnd twenty-two minutes," read Mor
iss' wire. "Arriving at San Antonio
wo were checked in by R. S. Israel,
Auto Editor of the San Antonio Ex
press, and found we had cut "down the
best previous road record by over
three hours. In making this record,
wo bent tho famous Katv Limited on
the Missouri, Kansas & Texas line by
one hour nnd thirty-three minutes.
This is the fastest train running be
tween tho two points. Half of tho
distance wns over black, muddy roads
so rough that we thought tho car
would not stand up under tho strain.
Despite tho terrific test, car and mo
tor are in excellent shape and wo can
repeat the trip to-morrow. Trip has
caused big sensation ns our time was
considered impossible over the country
roads."
Just previous to tho wire from
Mr. Moriss a dispatch was received
from Jacksonville newspnpers, carry
ing ncwB of nncw record from Atlan
ta, Gu., to Jacksonville, Fla., made
by a Chnlmers Six-30. Tho enr wa3
driven by Leman Phelan nnd Homer
George and wns tho Bamo machine
which lowered tho Atlanta Chattano
oga road record two weeks ago. Phe
lan nnd George drovo the 3,400 R. P.
M. Chalmers over tho 355 miles in 11
hours and 59 minutes elapsed time.
Four passengers wore carried on tho
trip Heavy rain turned tho roads
into miniature lakes along tho route
and slowed up the car's timo, ao did
several stops for tire repairs. The
last fifty miles wore mado in a contin
uous downpour, through mud and
slush, whilo eighty miles of deop sand
between Waycross and Jacksonville
interfered with fast traveling.
Among the remarkable features of
(he five new road records established
by Chalmers Six-30'o in tho post
month, is tho uniform speed main,
teii.ed under poor weather und road
conditions. On tho record breaking
npolis, Atlanta-Chattanooga nnd the
two more recent southern rond trips,
an average speed of over 30 miles
per hour has boon achieved over a
grand total of 2,137 miles of country
roads and mountain trails.
INFANTILE PARALYSIS.
Suggestions as to the Prevention of
This Dreaded Disease.
(By Dr. R. R. Daniels.)
From everything that has been
learned up to date of infantile paraly
sis, the disease is caused by a germ
which finds lodgment in tho mucous
membrnno of tho nose and throat, and
of the stomach and intestine. Here
the germ multiplies rapidly and forms
its poison; theso poisons are taken up
by the blood and carried to all parts
of the body. The effect of theso poi
sons upon nearly all parts of tho body
are no different from that of most
other germ poisons, except that theso
poisons aro particularly injurious to
the nerve cells in tho spinal cord,
which govern tho muscles of the limbs
particularly tho lower limbs. In an
attack of tho discaso tho partial or
complete destruction of those nerve
cells takes placo in a few hours, but
tho full effects aro not apparent for
several months.
Mnkc the Child Disease-Proof.
Inasmuch ns tho germ of infantile
paralysis seems to bo disseminated by
flics, a systematic extermination of
these pests is important in the preven
tion of tho disease. Howevor, keeping
tho child in a high stato of resistance,
in tho best of health, is of even great
er importance. Germs attack only
thoso whoso diseaso-rcsisting powers
arc low; germs find n portal of entry
in a weak spot in tho body. In tho
caso of infintilo paralysis, tho "weak
spots" aro tho noso and throat, and
the stomach and intestines. If wo are
to avoid this dread disease wo must
keep the child.'s air passages in heal
thy condition 'and keep tho stomach
and bowels in good shape. It is sig
nificant thut , this disease attacks
children at tho age when they are
weaned and taken to tho tablo and fed
anything and everything. Avoiding
colds, eoro throats and catarrh in
children by proper feeding and plenty
of fresh air; and keeping tho Btomach
and bowels in good condition through
careful feeding will go a long way
toward eliminating infintilo paralysis.
