Washington, July 26. In reply
to a complaint form Mrs. Henry
Smith, of Winamac, Ind., who has a
son In the National Guard, President
Wilson wrote to-day that the Guard
was being kept on the Mexican bor- a'n to obtain relief for tobacco ex

The President referred to the pre
cautions of the War Department to
make the border camps safe against
disease, and said tho health record of
both regulars and guardsmen was ex
ceptionally good. His letter was made
public because many communications
similar to that of Mrs. Smith are be
ing received and to answer criticisms
that the meu of the National Guard
are not being properly cared for. The
letter follows:
"Your letter of July 23 distresses
me a good deal because It shows that
you have not been correctly Inform
ed as to tho purpose of having the
National Guard at the border. It Is
not for the purpose of drill, but for
tho purpose of protecting tho coun
try. Tho service that the men are
performing thero Is an honor to
them and a necessity to the United
States. I cannot bellovo that the
men In the National Guard would
wish to bo oxcused from It or would
lose heart because of tho dlscom

Lquest of Representative Alben W.

Ions of the Orders in Council, which
wero raised last November.
Tho Kentucklan pointed out to officials-
of the State Department that
dark tobacco growers Jn Kentucky
and other States have larga orders
with aents'In Germany and Austria
and that having gone upon tho as
sumption that the order would not

Under the original provision of the
Orders in Council, tobacco shipments
for Holland, The Netherlands and
other neutrals had to be sent care of
The Netherlands Oversea Trust,
which Is permitted to operate under

MEXICAN AFFAUt
At a Stand Still; Another MI.Mindei
titandlng Over Commission.
Washington, . July 2G. Develop
ments on tho diplomatic discussions
with tho Carranza government have
been at a stand still for five dnys,
awaiting a reply to tho suggestions
of tho United States. It Is understood
that the United States desires that
the power of tho commission ap
pointed to seek a solution of border
difficulties bo far greator than Car
ranza has proposed. Officials believe
that tho circulation in Mexico City
of an inaccurate statement of the
status of negotiations has proven an
obstacle in deciding tho scope of the
proposed commission's discussions.

ILLINOIS TROOPS ARE
ACCUSED OF SHIRKING
SANDS OF THE DESERT TOO
WARM FOR MILITIAMEN
. ON HIKE.
San Antonio, Tex., JuIy-2&-. zlhtA
rioting of certain members of the
Eighth Illinois Infantry, composed of
negroes, and the alleged shirking of
whole squads of the First Illinois
brigade o'n a practice anarch' yester
day were the topic of much comment
today.
Negro guardsmen say that slurs
cast on them by whites, both civil
ians and military, led to the attack
by Herbert Henne. Some of them
chased Henne from his automobile
into a saloon, where he defended him
self until a provost guard of regu
lars arrived and fired "on the mili
tiamen, slightly wounding three of
them. The Incident is regarded as
closed except for trial of the actual
culprits.
Reports of regular army Observers
to department headquarters Indicate
that the number of those who fell
out In the march of the Illinois bri
gade was about the same in all three
regiments, the showing of the first
being a llttlo better perhaps than
that of tho Second and Seventh. Tho
exact number of those who dropped
out and waited for assistance Is not
known, even to headquarters' offi
cers, since In most cases, the fatigued
be-Lol(jlera were-ordered out of ambu-
lance, and motor truck and back In
to line when they had ridden for a
tlm,e, and became rested.
Regular army officers ascribe the
large number of stragglers entirely
to the softened condition of the men.
The marching was done in light or
der, no packs being carried, and the
distance, ten miles, was made at an
average of a little more than two
miles an hour.
TOBACCO LOOKING GOOD
Ohio County's Prospects Look Better
Tlian For 20 Years.
The tobacco crop In Ohio county,
while not the largest, Is perhaps tho
most promising at this season of tho
year of any grown for years, probab
ly for 20 years. The crop Is also
very early, which will necessitate ex
treme caro In cutting In 'order to
avoid sun burn. Sun burned tobac
co Is no hotter than frost bitten to
bacco, if as good.
It has become as much a fixed rule
with tobacco growers In somo sec
tions, more especially In tho hurley
district, to deadon tobacco a few days
boforo cutting as It Is to sucker It.
This not only prevents sun burn but
causes It to wilt and start yellowing.
This also prevents breaking and loss
of a lot of leaves and barring acci
dents, Insures a first-class color.
Too much care can not bo given to
tho tobacco crop from this date on as
a farmer may easily Increase or di
minish tho market value ?1.00 to
$2.00 per hundred, or even more.

IRISH SITUATION
APPEARS CRITICAL
STATUS OF EMERALD ISLE HAS
GONE FROM HAD TO WORSE
SINCE UPRISING.
N0REMEDYYET0FFERED
Great Britain Scents To Re Making
No Progress in Solving The
Problem.
London, July 25 (1 p. m.). Ap
parently the status of Ireland has
gone steadily from bad to worse ever
since tho Sinn Fein rising on Easter
Sunday, for at present the country
Is In tho hands of a temporary and
makeshift government composed of
a commission of Judges assisted by
Major Gen. Sir John Maxwell, com
mander df tho British forces In Ire
land, who still Is maintaining milita
ry control over most of the ordinary
functions.
There Is no viceroy in the place of
Baron Wlmborne, former Lord Lieu
tenant of Ireland, and as Premier
Asquith announced that the Dublin
Castle system, of the government wan
an utter failure, none Is likely to bo
appointed. Tie office of Auguctlnor
Blrrell, ex-Cnief Secretary for Ire
land remains unfilled and Herbert
Samuel, the head of the home office,
.who. has no special knowledge of Ir
ish affairs, represents the Interests
of Ireland In. the Cabinet and before
the House of Commons.
At Critical Stage.
Great Britain finds Itself at one of
the most critical stages of the war,
again distracted by wrangllngs over
the old problem and with apparent',
ly no light ahead. The Nationalist
members in tho House of Commons,
who as a party thus far have sup
ported the government's war and do-

position party. The position of tho
Nationalists, moreover, Is anomal
ous. Discontent in Ireland over tho
government's dealings with the In
surrection has become so widespread,
according to all reports, that the Na-
tionallsts have lost the confidence of
their constituents and probably would
be repudiated If they stood for re
election today.
, Cabinet Blamed.
The English newspapers of all fac
tions blame the cabinet for its man
agement of the Irish question, and
regret the failure of a compromise,
the only conspicuous excoption be
ing tho Morning Post, which consist
ently demanded the government of
Ireland by a strong hand 'and no
home rule.
John Redmond, leader of the Irish
Nationalists, in his speech last night
said:
Redmond's View. "
"I will not bandy words about a
breach df the faith or the violation of
a solemn agreement, but I want tho
government clearly to understand
that they have entered upon a courso
which is bound to increase Irish bus-1
plclon of tho good faith ot British
statesmen. To Inflame feeling in
Ireland would do serious mischief
to thoso high in imperial interosts
which wo are told necessitated a pro
visional settlement ot this question.
"Some tragic fatality seems to dog
the footsteps of this government In
all their dealings with Ireland. Ev
ery step taken by them since the coal
ition was formed, and especially since
the unfortunato outbreak In Dublin,
has been lamentable. They havo
disregarded overy advice we havo
tendered them, and now, having got
us to Induce our pooplo to mako a
tremendous sacrifice- and to agroo to
tho temporary exclusion ot the six
Ulstor counties, they throw this
agreement to tho winds and have
taken the surest means to accentuate
every possible danger and difficulty
In the Irish situation."
