MSBRCBDBS, Texas, July 28.—An
American army of 60,000men, Including
New York, Illinois, Virginia, Iowa, Da
kota, Minnesota, Indiana and Nebras
ka troops, lies as helpless In the mud
dy lower Bio Grande valley today as
an angle worn In a Jug of sorghum
molasses. It the despatch car of
Lieutenant J. H. Mtancaster, chief of
the new motor car machine gun squad,
with Sergeant Wallace, of the new
squad as driver, I rode fifty miles
along the lower Rio Gtande front to
day.
The folly of equipping our army
with trucks after the European fash
ion and not having the European
roads, was seen every half mile. I
tried to Imagine that I was riding
along one of the several fronts. Such
sights as no European front affords,
were common.
A rain, such as today's, would have
made no difficulties on any European
front, but It almost paralyzef the,
American forces.

When I began the trip I knew that
-many regiments were absolutely
horseless and In case of any sudden
movement It would be necessary to
transport all supplies on trucks and
all troops on trucks or afoot.
Seven miles from Brownsville we
found a three-ton truck blocking the
road—mired—with two trucks held up
behind it. If there had been 10,000
men behind goin to save some- des
perate military situation, they would
have been held up as well.
It wasn't the fault of the truck,
which was resting on Its axles with
the wheels whirling'uselessly in mud
pits. This In the middle of the road.
All European- roads—even those in re
mote Gallcia, the present Russian
front even those in Greece, Macedo

with stone in the middle, so that mid-
Ten miles farther on another truck
was mired the same way. As far as
other sights are concerned. It Is easy
to imagine the trip. I was behind
the European armies and saw many
soldiers mud-covered, dirty and wet.
Near San Benito we passed the dismal
American army cemetery, with white
wooden crosses, where a few of the
soldiers killed In the Mexican raids
are burled.- An American army hat
was stuck on one cross.

pit made by truck earllier In the
day. Eight Louisiana soldiers, under
orders of Captain Wilson. Twenty

DESPERATE RESISTANCE

•^"iY oners Are Captured
W':" There.
LONDON, July 28. Until today
British troops fighting, to push through
through the Pozleres sector, have
been thrusting up hill. Today they
have the advantage of fighting from
above on an enemy below on lower
ground. They have the added advan
tage of attacking an enemy unaided
by natural cover and now ousted from
the permanent steel and concrete con
structed trenches, perfected in the
long months of the deadlock in the
line.
foremost among the disadvantages
of General Haig's position was the
fact that the kaiser Is making super
human efforts to stem any further
break in his lines. Reserves have
been stripped from all along the Ger
man front to be massed against the
British, or used in desperate counter
attack. Special despatches from Ver
dun say the German attack there has
waned into a mere ordinary assault,
Instead of the holocaust of flame from
artillery with which the French for
tress has been deluged during the last
six months, with practically no con
certed infantry attacks.
Experts here agree that the kaiser
^rlU make desperate attempts in con
certed counter attacks to win back the
ground wrung-Mnch by inch, almost
—from .his soldiers by the British. An
advance very much" further along the
road from Pozleres to Bapaume by
the British, would menace the German
troops In the angle of the line from
Thlepval southeast, possibly forcing
a retirement there.

of ths Coming
Campaign.,
NEW YORK, July 28.—First for
mal Indication that Mexico will be
the main issue on which the republi
cans will attack the Wilson adminis
tration in the presidential campaign
was contained In a statement issued
today by National Chairman Wlllcox.
The statement denied the republi
can party's criticism of the handling,
of the Mexican problem was "dictated
by any sinister influence" end bitterly
assailed Wilson's "maladministration"
of affairs there.
The Wlllcox statement ifas as fol
lows:
"All statements made in news
papers or elsewhere to the effect that
the attitude of the republican party
towards the situation in Mexico is
dictated by any sinister influence,
corporate or otherwise are contrary
to the facts. Our interest in Mexican
affairs is the result solely and ex
clusively of the maladministration of
American relations with Mexico and
the various Mexican factions. The
weakness of the Wilson administra
tion in dealing with th-3 Mexican
question
is so fully before the Ameri
can people that it is a vital issue in
this campaign.
"It is therefore, not possible for
the democratic party to evade the
responsibility for conditions in
Mexico by ascribing ulterior motives.
The issue is plain and clear cut. It
ts the principle of the republican
oarty to insist upon the^ full protec
tion of American citizens and Ameri
cah rights."

The Nellen and Nutten sank. Three
sailors were killed, the remaining

The other two patrol boats are

Fryatt of the British merchant
steamer Brussels, was executed for a

German sea forces on order of afield
court of the navy corps, according to

March 28, 1915, near the Maas fire
ship, he endeavored to ram the Ger

officer and his first engineer later re

were mentioned in the house of com
mons.
Fryatt was captured Inter. Sen

BAI/TTMORB, M*L, July M.—"Watch

that a plan is on foot to-have ves

and "accidentally" ram her. This
would save the allied patrol a big
task and as one of the Germans put
it, the British could say: 'XXh, I beg
pardon I will pay you damages."
This fear Is believed to be one of
the compelling' motives behind or
ders to delay the Demtschland's de
parture.
The Bremen, however. Is a vital
factor. Stories that she has been
captured brought the comment from
a Dentdhland official today:
"Bah, she is not lost until three, or
Dour weeks," and he added that the
Deutochland's sister ship is too clev
er to fall into the merihea ot the al

mystery still haunted the situation.
There has been a Ion# party aboard
the Neckar at the Deutschland P*«r
some of the crew had Individual par
ties ashore, rolling In during the
early hours.
But no one oonnected with ths sub
sea venture would rwveal when the
'Deutschland stay ends. The forty
eight hours since the Deutschland
cleared, expired this afternoon, hut
under local port rules it was found
that the vessel need not reclear as
supposed, except in case she alters
her cargo. This is still being trim

Rumor Unfounded.
OTTAWA, Ont., July 28.—What tha
naval department described later as
an unfounded report that the Ger
man submarine freighter Bremen had
been captured off Halifax, created
excitement here today. No one knew
where the rumor originated.
Looking up a Pilot.
BA/LTEMORE, Md., July 28.—The
Deutschland prepared today to take
on a pilot from the Maryland Pilots'
association, but that organization
said Owen Coleman, who brought her
up the river, was out of town add not
lmemdlately available tor service.
While Captain Zack ©ullison, of the
tug Timmins, wants Coleman, the
rules of -the association require that
vessels take "the first man out," the
first man on the pilot list.
lA. twenty-four hour crew is aboard
the Timmins, giving the impression,
that the stay of the Deutschland is
not long and that when she does
head out, she may plan a lay over in
