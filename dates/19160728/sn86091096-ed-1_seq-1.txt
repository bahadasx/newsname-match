THE WOMEN'S
PARTYAWAKENING
Women of Idaho Still Wear
Chains of Provinciality
^ A great missionary movement is
afoot, but many of the women of
Idaho still "sit in darkness." Wo
men of the east have come to the
"free states" of the west with the
evangel of a new freedom in their
hands, but the women of Idaho, de
spite their eighteen years of polit
ical equality within their own state
lines, still wear the chains of con
ventions, prejudice and provin
ciality. The women of the east,
who stretch out their hands to
women in equal suffrage states,
and cry "Come over and help us,"
are saying also to these same
women, "Ye are not free till we
are free," and this is true in a two
fold sense. In the first place, the
women of Idaho are not free until
they realize the sisterhood of
women, a^men so much more
easily realize the brotherhood of
man— they are not free until they
have in much larger measure a
state-consciousness and a nation
consciousness, as well as the con
sciousness of the kindly protective
four wall of home which too often
confine their activities and
limit their vision. In the second
place, in a narrower sense, women
of Idaho are not politically free as
men are, for east of Wyoining they
may not go, nor south of Colorado,
without losing that freedom of the
ballot for which in times past men
have fought and bled, and which
women of the west have gained
perhaps too easily and hbld too
lightly.
Women lack chivalry. They are
too used to being the "weaker
vessel" and do not know how to
use their strength graciously. "Let
the eastern women get the vote
we got it, by working for it," they
say, not comprehending these three ;
facts: First, that when the Idaho :
women got the vote, there was no
number of voting women strong ;
enough to help, whereas women !
now vote in twelve states; Second,,
that the women of the east have j
already worked for suffrage longer ;
than the life of many western
states; Third, that the power of the
machine government, and the al
most impossibility of amending the
state constitution in many states
makes an amendment to the U. S.
constitution the only hope of many
eastern women. For example, in
the state of Indiana the constitution
has never been amended, and an
amendment must be approved by a !
majority of the votes of all the !
i
qualified electors. Rarely does »
majority of the qualified electors of j
\ state register, much less vote. j
yi What women need is a larger
vision. It is only in the last gen
eration that women have realized 1
that their own peculiar activities
of home-making and bringing up
children are better served if they
may vote for pure-food laws and a
"dry" town. Perhaps another gen
eration must pass away before they
have learned that a limited
intellectual and moral horizon is
as bad for the spirit as unsan
itary conditions for the body of
a growing child, and the thoughts
of women also "will broaden with
the process of the suns."

James Whitcomb Riley Dead
James Whitcomb Riley died Sat
urday night at his home, following
a stroke of paralysis, only the nurse
in charge being present. Mr. Riley
suffered his first stroke in 1910,
his right side being paralyzed then ;
but he almost fully recovered from
that and enjoyed good health until
recently. He was bom at Green
field, Indiana, about 1853, but'the
exact date is not known, as he was
reticent about his age,
For years the Hoosier poet was
an itinerant sign painter, and ,ama
teur writer of verse, and in 1870
took up work on an Anderson
paper. In the early 80's Mr. Riley
settled in Indianapolis, as writer of
Hoosier dialect poetry for the
Journal. His later years were
spent in writing and readings, and
he amassed a comfortable fortune
from his works.
Will Thresh Clover
Ed Pompey who lives near South,
wick has forty acres of Alsike
clover on his place. He is letting
it get ripe and will* thresh the en
tire crop for seed. He says the
heads are well filled with seed and
are beginning to turn brown. Ed
Gertje has a field of twenty-two
acres which he intends to thresh
this fall. It has been a favorable
year for clover seed as the cool
weather and late rains allowed the
heads to fill. Clover straw makes
good winter fodder for both horses
and cattle so that the seed is prac
tically clear profit.
Paper Investigation
Several foreign governments,
realizing the scarcity of paper-mak
ing material, have forbidden its ex
port to other countries. The effect
of this has been widespread, espec
ially in the United States, where
the demand for raw material now
is greater than the supply, with re
; sultant high prices . Obviously,
: corresponding increases in the cost
of all kinds and grades of paper
; bave taken place. It is wise to
! save waste paper> rags> etc ., for
they are valuable. There is at
j preS ent an increased demand for
; paper> cardboa rd, etc., in the
United States. The present daily
produc ti 0 n of paper ofall kinds is
!
!
over 15,000 tons. Competent au
thority states that rags form 7.8
per cent of the fibers we use in pa
per making; waste paper, books,
magazines, etc., form 21.4 per cent
Saving old paper and rags means a
saving of the forests. The hearty
cooperation of every man, woman,
and child is essential if the collec
i tion of waste materials is to be
made a success.

Extinguish Smut Explosions
East Saturday there was a dem-
onstration of a fire extinguisher
1 for smut explosions, at Prescott,
Wash. An all-wood thresher was
caused to catch fire from a smut
explosion, but the test was a suc-
cess and the fire was extinguished
in less than a minute. All there is
to the extinguisher is a rope, a
bottle of acid and some water con-
j taining soda.
reamer, say, will you dream for me
A wild sweet dream of a foreign land,
Whose border sips of a foaming sea
With lips of coral and silver sand;
Where warm winds loll on the shady deeps,
Or lave themselves in the tearful mist
The great wild wave of the breaker weeps
O'er crags of opal and amethyst?
Dreamer, say, vi ill you dream a dream
Of tropic shades in the lands of shine,
Where the lily leans o'er an amber stream
That flows like a rill of wasted wine,—
Where the palm-trees, lifting their shields of
green,
Parry the shafts of the Indian sun
Whose splintering vengeance falls between
The reeds below where the waters run?
Dreamer, say, will you dream of love
That lives in the land of sweet perfume,
Where the stars drip down from the skies
above
In molton spatters of bud and bloom?
Where never the weary eyes are wet,,
And never a sob in the balmy air,
And only the laugh of the paroquet
Breaks the sleep of the silence there?
-James Whitcomb Riley.

Care Of Cream
a
During the hot days of spring
and summer the farmer who is sell
ing cream to the creamery finds it
a problem to keep his cream in the
proper condition. However, there
are but a few simple rules which
should be followed, that would re
sult in better cream. First of all
there is cleanliness. Dirt, remem
ber, carries bad flavors. If the
barn or its surroundings and cows
are dirty it will result in poor milk;
poor milk results in poor cream ;
poor cream results in poor butter.
Immediately after separating,
the cream should be cooled down to
at least 50 degrees F. Warm cream
should never be poured upon cold
as the temperature of the lot is
raised and bad flavors may result.
It is essential that the cream be
stirred frequently to insure uniform
ripening. If the cream is left un
disturbed, the fat rises the same
way as it does in milk. As a result
the cream is full of curd particles
or it becomes "lumpy."
Never put cream in a rusty or
battered can and always remember
that milk and cream have that prop
erty of absorbing bad flavors.—W.
B. Combs.
Crum in South Idaho
Word comes from Geo. E. Crum,
of Lewiston, Idaho, who is now
South Idaho in the interest of his
candidacy for the Republican nomi
nation for governor, that he
meeting with splendid success and
confidently expects to be nominated
He also states that he is working
hard to create favorable sentiment
for the proposed North and South
road, the route of which he travel
ed by automobile last week in going
from Lewiston to Boise. Mr. Crum
is thorough in everything he under
takes, and, feeling that the north
and south road was a matter of im
portance to the state of Idaho as
whole, he undertook this trip in
order to personally acquaint him
self with the difficulties of con
struction and the advantage of
such a road. As a result of his in
vestigation he is heartily in favor
of the construction of the road, ar.d
favors state and federal aid to ac
complish the desired result. Mr.
Crum also visited the honor convict
camp at Whitebird and investigated
their work and surroundings.
The Non-partisan Crum Club, of
Lewiston, is active in behalf of Mr.
Crum, this club having been or
ganized as a result of the desire of
his fellow citizens to aid in his
candidacy.

The Nez Perce courtty commis
sioners, Wednesday, received the
deeds for right-of-way for the
changes in the Pine creek road
near Cameron. The improvements
planned will reduce the grade from
25 to 8 per cent and will facilitate
travel for a large section of the
Potlatch country. The farms af
fected and the damages awarded
are:
Carl Hartung, $153.75.
Joseph Schultz, $75.
William Hartung, $82.50.

Okoke-Klootchman Meet
Wednesday evening the Okoke
Klootchman entertained their hus
bands at a porch party at the Shu
maker home. They had planned a
picnic dinner to be held near
McCrea's but the weather looked
unfavorable so the porch party was
held instead. A substantial supper
was served early in the evening.
Mr. and Mrs. Frank Candee and
Mr. and Mrs. Hans Flo were guests
of the club.
P. L. Smith, of Moscow, has a
Polled Durham cow at his farm
near Colton, that he considers a
little the best cow in the northwest,
reports the Moscow Post. For the
third consecutive time last spring
this cow gave birth to twins—three
years ago two heifers, two years
ago two bulls, and last spring a
fine pair of heifers again. And
last spring the first pair of twin
heifers gave birth to two fine cal
ves, making eight descendants from
this one cow in three years. Fur
thermore, this cow is now giving
six gallons of rich milk a day and
on Tuesday of this week, for good
measure, gave four gallons at one
milking. Mr. Smith says he has
never seen the record of this cow
beaten anywhere. She is not for
sale.
A Profitable Cow
Indian Babies Score High
Some of the Indian babies shown
at the recent baby contest in Fair
view, Oklahoma, scored high in the
examination conducted under the
direction of agricultural and me
chanical college professors. Stelle
Mixhair, ten months old, and Mary
Mixhair, sisters, were given marks
of 91 and 90. The Indian babies
would have scored even higher had
it not been for the roughness of
their skins and the lack of groom
ing. The Indians took great inter
est in the baby show. The mothers

the way to care for them as white
mothers do.
A petrified tree, thought to be
the only one ever found in this part
of Idaho, was found by T. B. Jones
of the Potlatch Lumber company
last week. Sheriff Campbell, w h° '
returned from the Bovill and Elk
River country recently, brought
back a specimen of the curio. It
has the appearance of agate, and is
so hard that a hack-saw operated
qy machinery failed to make even
a notch on it although several at
tempts were made. Many beauti

man of the Idaho Honey Producers'
Association reports their total sales
for 1915 as $49,764.66. The aver
age price received for extracted
honey per hundred pounds
was

early and at an advanced price over
the season of 1914.
FIND TWO WAYS
TOKILL SMUT
Sow Wheat Before Spores
Scatter While Threshing
Means to eliminate approximate
ly all danger from smut, which
causes annual losses ranging from
$5,000,000 to $15,000,000 to Inland
Empire winter wheat crops, have
been discovered as the result of
four years' investigation work by
Washington State college. Dr. Ira
D. Cardiff, director of the experi
ment station, stated that he was
confident that the solution had been
found. He says that either one of
two methods may be followed by
wheat farmers. They may sow
winter wheat before threshing
time or they may sow at the usual
time in summer fallow, first giving
the land a deep replowing.
Smut is a fungus growth. The
spores on the wheat grains grow on
the inside of the wheat plant, show
ing again in the grains of seed.
The spores are blown about at
threshing time. If planting is
done before threshing the resulting
wheat crop is found to be absolute
ly free of smut. If planting is
done after threshing time the smut
spores are scattered about the
ground, but can be turned under
and out of the way of the wheat by
deep plowing. In the experiment
work half of one field was subject
ed to deep plowing ; the other half
was n °t- The wheat planted on
the replowed ground had less than
one per cent smut; that on the
other half, twenty-five per cent.
Another experiment conducted
to show that the smut spores are
a menace only on the surface, was
to burn straw on a field. The
wheat which came up later showed
absolutely no smut. This is not
' recommended a.s a practical method,
They Borrowed The Paper
however. In the first place a
wheat grower would not have suffi
cient straw, and in the second
place the burning injures the soil.
Dr. Cardiff said the equipment
of threshing separators with blow
ers, to clear the wheat from smut,
separating the smut in bags so as
preven t ;t from being scattered,
also was recommended .
.
Once upon a time, a man who
was too economical to take a paper
sent his little boy to borrow the
copy taken by the neighbors. In
his haste, the boy ran over a four
dollar stand of bees, and in ten
minutes looked like a watery sum
mer squash. His cries reached his
father, who ran to his assistance,
and failing to see the barb-wire
fence, ran into it, breaking it down,
cutting a handful of flesh from his
anatomy and ruining a five dollar
pair of pants. The old cow took
advantage of the gap in the fence,
got into the corn-field and killed
herself eating green corn. Hear
ing the racket, his wife ran, upset
ting a four-gallon churn full of
rich cream into a basket of kittens,
drowning the whole 'flock'. In her
hurry she dropped a seven-dollar
set of teeth. The baby, left alone.
crawled through the spilt milk into
the parlor and ruined a twenty-dol
lar carpet. During the excitement
the oldest daughter ran away with
the hired man, the calves got out
and the dog broke up eleven set
ting hens. Moral: subscribe for
