to officials Friday admitted that he
killed his neighbor. Madison Powell,
Wednesday morning with a revolver,
were taken back to their home Friday
afternoon.
The two boys were arrested on the
afternoon of the tragedy and brought
to the county Jail as witnesses. Since
their father made a statement in which
he professed he shot Powell In self-defense,
the two boys have been allowed
to go home.
Although considerable evidence of a

statement was obtained. .
r heriff Smith brought Berry out of
his cell and in the presence of others
requested him to relate ail toe thlr.il
that happened on the mum Ins of the
crime.
Berry began and VM of tha trouble
he and hia neighbor several months
previous to the shooting and then de
clared that he did not know anything
about the crime and that the first he
knew of It waa when his boys came
back. - ,
Tha revolver which tha officers
found at tha Berry home bora marks
of having been tampered with. Deputy
Sheriff Arthur aaid and the author
ities were perplexed in accounting fur
it. They had the revolver. It waa rus
ty and two chambera were marked
with what is believed to have been

would not shoot.
So when Berry had finished hla story
Sheriff Smith asked him several ques

employed a very clever lead" which
brought Out the statement. -
"See here. Berry." said Sheriff E. W.
Smith, "how do you account for your
being wet arhen you say you were not
out of ihe house that morning?"
I wasn't out of the- house and my
clothes weren't wet," declared Berry.
"Now, Mr. Berry. I waa out to your

FORT GAY. W. Va, HAS
OF NURSING ON
ITS HANDS
A JOB
A case of smallpox was discovered
in Fort Gay Wednesday night, the
victim being a white employee of the
street carnival. He was engineer for
the 5Ierry-go-round. The case had
reached an advanced stage;' in fact,
it ha missed Ihe criwiA nnil lh man la
In earing recovery. He says he con
sulted a physician in Pikeville re
cently and was given treatment for
ivy- poisoning. The case is mild because
the man had been vaccinated a few
years ago, but if a lot of caes do not
result from the exposures of the past
week or ten days it will not be because
his case was not ripe for spreading the
filthy disease. Those exposed should
be vaccinated at once.
The man and his wife are now quar
antined at Fort Gay. He was expos
ed to smallpox in South Carolina a
month or more ago. He has been with
this street fair only about ten days.
Street fairs are about the worst
pests that come to any town and
should be ahut out. They are too
low. tough and rotten for any use.
