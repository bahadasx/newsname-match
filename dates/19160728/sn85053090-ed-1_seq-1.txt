A Letter From the Front
The following interesting let
ter was received this week by C.
M. Reese from Hal lie Campbell,
one of the Ekalaka boys who is
down on the border within shoot
ing distance of the greasers:
Douglas, Ariz.
July 17, 1916
Friend Mel:
We are not very busy this p.m.
the company having just under
gone an inoculation for typhoid
fever, malaria, etc. which is the
third one we have taken, and so
will try and write a few lines.
As you will see we are stationed
at Douglas, Ariz, which is about
250 miles southwest of El Paso
and about 100 miles southwest of
Columbus, N. M. where the big
raid took place. We came thru
both those places on the way to
our present camp and are now
but one-half of a mile from the
border. There has been several
days when we could see a Mexi
can flag waving at a distance of
about a mile. We landed here
about 10 days ago in what ap
peared to be the most desolate
lookinp country I had ever met
up with. The entire regiment
have been very busy since then
now have got the mesquite, etc.
grubbed out, ttreets all graded,
ditches and sewers dug and the
water pipes laid until one would
not know it was the same place.
We have not done as much drill
ing as should have been done on
account of so much other work
that was neccessary first.
Everything is getting regulat
ed and we will probably put in
about four hours drilling a day
from now on except when we go
out on patrol, that is patroling
the border. Our company ex
pects to be called out the latter
part of this week, when we wili
be out there a week and then wil.
come back to camp for a tim»
where we will drill practically
every day until our turn to go
out agaii:. There is supposed to
be about 15,000 troops stationed |
at Douglas, our camp however i.
a half mile or more from any j
other. All troops are drilling I
and preparing for trouble and il !
worst comes to worst they ought
to be in good shape to right ovei
the line into Mexico in a shori j
time. The Montana Regiment is j
said to be one of the best lookinp !
physically that has arrived oi.
the border and they are expect
ing to mount about 40 per cent of
our regiment which will probably
be mostly for patrol work along
the Mexican line.
The Captain has promised to
put me with the mounted as Soon
as they this and I expect to take
advantage of it.
Your friend,
Hallie Campbell
Co. I., 2nd Mont. Reg.

KILLING AT ALZADA
Willie Thompson Kills George
Whitney and Posse in
Turn Gets Thomp
son's Life.
Young Men Well Known
Thompson Was Queer Acting
Fellow, Believed Insane.
Sheriff Jones, County Attorney
Chas. Dousman and Coroner E.
O. Colvin were called to Alzada
Thursday upon word being re
ceived that a shooting had taken
place there, one William Thomp
son having killed George Whit
ney, and who himself was later
killed by those sent to arrest
him.
Taking his rifle, Thompson,
who lives about a mile from Al
zada, went for a walk Wednesday
afternoon and dropped into town.
On his return trip towards home
he was passed on the road by
George Whitney and a cousin in
a buggy. They stopped and in
vited young Thompson to get in
and ride, to which his only reply
was to raise his rifle and fire.
The first shot struck the buggy
seat when the cousin dropped to
to the bottom and commenced
urging the team on. Whitney
remained in the seat and was in
stantly killed by the second shot.
After getting out of range of the
rifle, which was a 30-30, the
cousin circled the neighborhood
and returned to town where word
of the shooting was given.
Justice O'Shaughnessy, pub
lisher of the Fairplay deputized
V. B. Ackerman, C. L. Wood and
E. M. Wilson to accompany him
to arrest Thompson. On arriv
ing at the Thompson home they
inquired as to the whereabouts
of young Thompson but his par
ents said he had gone for a walk
in the afternoon and had not re
tured. While they were there
the young fellow appeared over
on a hill but as the car and offi
cers were between him and the
house he moved around until the
house was out of range and then
fired at the men. He was then
recognized and told to drop his
gun or he would be killed. He
replied "I never will" and fired
again whereupon the special offi
cers each fired one shot, all of
which took effect causing instant
death. Prior to the arrival of
the coroner, Justice O'Shaugh
nessy and the Justice of Piniele
had held the inquest and buria!
made.
George Whitney was about 17!
years of aire, a son of Mrs. Jen-'

Henry Walker and Mrs. Dean
Howell. Willie Thompson was
the son of Wm. Thompson and
wife and about 20 years of age.
All the parties were well known
in the Alzada neighborhood.
It is said that young Thomp
son had acted queer at times,
but previous to the shooting he
had been swimming with some
of the town boys and they
seemed to think that he was
very normal acting and showed
no signs of being demented.
Ammendment to Land Laws
U. S. Commissioner S. J. Ems
wiler has received notice from
the land office that filings are
now being accepted under a new
amendment to the homestead
laws providing for additional en
tries not adjoining the original.
The law applies only to those
who have made final proof upon
their original entries and it is
immaterial whether or not the
entryman owns or resides upon
his original entry. However if
he does reside upon his original
entry and the addittional is with
in twenty miles of the same, he
is not obliged to live on the ad
ditional. In all other cases resi
dence on the additional entry is
required. It is also stipulated
that the total acreage of the two
entries shall not exceed 320 acres
and both tracts must be designa
ted and subject to 320 acre filing.
Cultivation of the addittional en
try is required in ali cases. An
entryman whose original home
stead entry contains 160 acres
and who has also a desert claim
of 160 acres is also entitled to the
160 acre addittional but if his
desert claim contains 320 acres
his right is exhausted.
Guaranteed Cure
We have been asked many
times to bust loose and give 'em
ail a raking over for the dis
graceful conditions of the public
roads, but what's the use? Why
nbt impose a penalty on those in
charge, making it compulsory
for them to ride a "tin lizzie"
for lfi hours a day up and down
the county roads on a stomach
full of sour beans? The county
roads are not the only ones that
need attention. Take a look,
(don't attempt to ride) at some
of our streets.
