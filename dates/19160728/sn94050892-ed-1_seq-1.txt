NUMBER 10
OLNEY WILL GARRY
MARICOPA
COUNTY
John R. Hampton Here This Week
From Phoenix Places His Majority
in that County at Not Less Than
Two Thousand Olney Growing
Stronger Every Day in the .State
Hon. J. R. Hampton, formerly a
resident of this county, but now mak
ing bis home in Phoenix where he is a
vaember of the law' firm of Hampton
& Arnold., arrived in Clifton this week
on a business trip. Mr. Hampton
bus business interests in this county
an well as Maricopa and is a fre
quent visitor here where he is al
ways welcome among a large number
cf friends. Mr. Hampton has been
a member of the Legislature from
Graham county on three occasions
and waa a member of the Territorial
Council when Greenlee was divided
from (irsbam. In the first Presi
dential election in Arizona he was
chosen as one of the three Presiden
tial electors from Arizona and had the
pleasure of casting the democratic
vote of Arizona for Woodrow Wil
son. He always takes a lively in
terest in political affairs of the state
and is a Democrat of the old school.
in the democratic primary cam
paign sow bein? waged in Arizona
Mr. Hampton is an enthusiastic sup
porter of Hon. George A. Olney and
while here this week predicted hi.-,
certain nomination as the democratic
Bti'jdard bearer in the November
general election.
"Judging Impartially from the re
ports received at Olney's headquarters
In Phoenix, from every precinct in
I'ancopa county, George Olney will
Carry that county by not less than
two thousand majority," said Mr.
Hamoton in talking to & group of
democrats here this week. "Some
of. the more enthusiastic democrats
in the county put his majority as
high as four thousand but I am con
vinced that the figure will not fall
below two thousand and very likely
his maior.'ty will be even greater
than that."
"I find that a large number of demo
crata, from all sections Of the state,
fee: f in tlif democratic party has
sufficiently honored Mr. Hunt and
that in the person of Mr. Olney
they have a democrat equally as
worthy and competent to fill the high
office of Governor. With . friend
ship for all Democrats and enmity
for none, standing squarely on the
principles of equal justice for all, and
special privileges for. none, upon
which the democratic party was
founded, more than one hun
dred years ago, and which has sus
tained this party ' since principles
which will live and be in evidence
wherever successful government is
found, Mr. Olney is making his cam
paign for the gubernatorial nomina
tion. Those who have known Mr.
Olney, either as a private citizen or
public official, as a business man or
neighbor, will testify to his worth as
a citizen of Arizona and as to his
capability to fill the highest office
In the state."
"The democratic supporters of Mr.
Olney are making a clean, open,
vigorous campaign for-his nomination,
and, with Maricopa .in the lead, I ex
pect to see him carry every county
in the state with the possible ex
ception of Yuma, Cochise, Gila and
Mohave."
Suicides in Missouri
The many friends in Morenci of
Mrs. A. B. Cutler, a former resident
of that place, were shocked this week
to hear that she had committed sui
cide at Joplin, Mo., where she had
been living since leaving Morenci
some four years ago. Mrs. Cutler
i-.ad been in failing health for some
time and this, coupled with the fact
that her husband had left her the
taking the children with him, is
attributed as the cause for the act.
Mrs. Cutler resided in Morenci some
five years ago, Mr. Cutler being at
the time in charge of the hardware
department of the Longfellow store.
Me was elected justice of the peace
at Morenci in 1912, but never took
office as B. iC. Williams, whom he
defeated, refused to relinquish his
position . Mr. and Mrs. Cutler
were well thought of in Morenci
where they left many friends who
ill regret to hear of her sad ending.
Engagement Announced
The Copper Era is pleased to an
nounce this week the engagement of
Miss Jessie McCorey, of' Morenci and
Mr. H. F. Smith, also of that place,
but at present serving with company
M of the Arizona National Guard.
Both are well known and popular
young people of Morenci. The date
of the wedding has not been definitely
announced but will occur just as
soon as Mr. Smith is relieved of his
military duties. Company M is now
stationed at the Roosevelt dam in
Maricopa county.

OLNEY NOT MAKING SLATE
PHOENIX, July 25 It has been
j claimed by some that George Ol
;ney, candidate for governor on the
j democratic ticket, was making a
. slate of candidates for the legislature
and other offices who were favorable
; to him and endorsed the platform on
which he was running.
' Mr. Olney stated that he is not
making any slate but is attending
'strictly to his own campaign. Neither
I he or his friends are lining up any
candidates in his favor or to run on
his platform. He has stated in his
1 platform where he stands on some
- of the leading issues that are before
the people of this state. He is against
special legislation of every sort and
(especially against special mine tax.
'legislation that favors the big mines
land is detrimental to all other inter
jests of the state.
; . Mr. Olney said:' "I am running on
a platform that I believe all fair
minded people can endorse and espec
ially all those who are affiliated with
the democratic party. I believe in
justice and equal rights to all. I am
against class legislation of every
sort and cordially Invite the co-operation
of all who can endorse the plat
form on which I am running. I am
seeking the nomination for governor
as a democrat and if I am nominated
and elected I promise that I will not
be a partisan governor but that I
will be the governor of and for all the
people of the state of Arizona."

THEMSELVES

After Having Won a Game Morenci

Although in last , Sunday s game
Morenci tried hard to keep up x the
speed they had regained two weeks

The local management is deploring
the fact that but very few of the
fair sex were in the grand stand
Sunday. The Fat Kid, who sat in
the grand stand last Sunday, stands
sponsor for the following conversat
ion he overheard during the game:
"A young Clifton beau was talking
to his enamorata and in the course
of the conversation said: "See that
fellow playing right field for Clif
ton? He is our best man." To
which the girl replied, "Why,
George, this is so sudden."
Lefty Harris, late pitcher of ' the
Globe team, was a Clifton arid Mo
renci " visitor this week . We would
like to have seen Morenci keep him
in the Hill City as he is a good pitch
er. Ashley, of Miami, will perhaps be
with the Clifton line-up next Sunday.
Clifton plays at Morenci next
Sunday, game called at 3:30 p, m.
It has been suggested that a team
be made up of old time players who
would tackle the local team and
show them how the game should be
played. The line-up suggested is
as follows: Riley, c; Ashley, p;
Fehrman, rf; Brubaker, lb; O'Brien,
2b; Danenhauer, cf ; Bennie, If; Smith,
ss; Brock, 3b; Simms, p. It is
thought that this aggregation would
be able to give the Clifton team a
run for their money and show them
"who's who" in basebaldom in this
section .
Harper-Stewart
C. J. Harper and Miss Forrest
Stewart slipped away from their
friends on Saturday afternoon and
went to Clifton, where they were
made man and wife. They return

welcomed with a shower of con
gratulations. Mrs: Harper is a daughter of Mr.

place and has made Duncan her home
most of her life. She has many
friends who wish her a life filled
with happiness and prosperity.
Mr. Harper is a young man who is
but a newcomer in Duncan, as he has
resided here for only three months.
He is employed as bookkeeper in the
Bank of Duncan, which position he
has filled since his coming to Dun

from Morenci and Metcalf-
At an ODen meetine of the RennhH.
can County Central Committee held
at the Hotel Reardon "last night a
large delegation of representative
republicans from all parts of the
county were present and a most en
thusiastic meeting was held. A full
ticket, with the exception of the
office of county attorney for which
there is no available timber, was put
In the field, and although tentative,
several have consented to run and it
is thought that the majority of the
ticket will stand as outlined.
The republicans have been rather
slow in getting started but now that
concerted action has been taken and
the ball started rolling the candidates
expect to carry on a vigorous cam
paign from now until November 4.
They have picked out what they con
sider will be a formidable array of
opponents and they intend to back
them to the limit. The prospective
candidates have all been residents
of Greenlee county for years and are
well acquainted with the needs of the
various offices to which they aspire.
The first business of importance of
the Central Committee last night was
the election of officers to fill the
vacancies caused by the resignation
of the former incumbents. The new
ly elected officers were: Chairman,
David E. Bronson; Secretary, J. L.
Adams; Treasurer, J. C. Gatti.
The ticket as outlined at this meet
ing and which will stand as it is, with
a possible few exceptions, is as fol
lows :
State Senator R. W. Chamberlain,
J. T. Yakey.

Big Circus Coming
On August 16th the people of the
CIifton-Morenci district will have an

largest tent shows that has ever
shown in this section of the country.
On that date Cole Brothers big circus
will be here in full force, according
to J. H. Rice, advance man, who
was in Clifton this week making ar.
rangemeuts lor the aggregation. The
outfit is viade up of two trains and
gives a tp?ee-ricg performance and
ti'.e acts are said to equal those of
tlio i;ire-t circvees. Clifton and the
surrounding community is fortunate
in having a show of this size visit
here and it will undoubtedly merit a
liberal patronage. Watch for the ad
vertisement in a later issue of the
Era.

SAVES LIFE OF MEXICAr'i BOY
Jack Campbell, first baseman ' of
the Clifton ball team and druggist at
the A. C. store, saved the life of a
three-year-old Mexican boy at twelve
thirty Thursday afternoon. This tot
of three years, tried to cross ' the
foot bridge at north Clifton. Half
way across, the mite lost his balance
and tumbled into the stream. At
this p.-rint the current is rather strong
and it carried the lad two hundred
feet down stream. Standing passive
ly by on the opposite side of the
creek were full grown Mexican men,
listing to the pitiful cries of the
drowning lad, none making an effort
to rescue him.
"Our Jack" who resides opposite
the bridge, and who at that very mo
ment was in the act of lathering his
face for a good clean shave, was at
tracted by the screams of the boy.
Dropping shaving brush and looking
like Santa Claus about to decorate a
Christmas tree, he made a' first base
run for the creek arid seized the
tot as he was going under , the third
time. There was clapping of hands
and vivas by the half hundred Mexi
cans who had gathered by this Urn
along the river bank.
Jack Campbell is one of the few men,
one meets now days, with true judg
ment who can be depended upon in a
crisis .
A life was saved. A mother's heart
made glad and the Copper Era doffs
its sombrero to a man Jack Camp
bell. Returns from Coast
Tommy Gordon, who has been
spending several weeks in California
and on the coast, returned to Clifton
the latter part of last week. It is
understood that he was detailed to
the coast in the capacity of a detec
tive, where he gathered important
evidence which was this '' week pro
duced at the trail of a suspected
German spy in Clifton. As a sleuth
Tommy has few equals.
Announcements
In this week's issue of the Era will
be found several new announcements,
among which are those of J. A. Rig
gins, candidate for State Superinten
dent of Public Instruction; D. D.
Boyles for County Supervisor; G. L.
Coffee for State Representative; and
Chas. Van Zant for County Treas
urer. The qualifications of Mr.
Riggins will be found in another
column, while the other candidates
are too well known' in Greenlee
county to need much comment. Mr.
Boyles has resided in the county for
a number of years where he is well
and favorably known, at the present
time being engaged in the cattle ia
dustry at his ranch on Rattlesnake.
G. L. Coffee Is also well known to
the voters of the county having lived
in Clifton for several years and be
ing engaged formerly in the cattle
business. He is serving his sceond
term as school trustee of the Clif
ton district and has at different
times in the past held office in the
town of Clifton. Charles Van
Zant is an old time resident of Clif
ton and has for many years been em
ployed by the Becker-Franz company
in North Clifton. These candidates
are all substantial citizens and will
no doubt give a good account of them
selves in the present campaign.
Mrs. Jack Canpbell, wife of "Our
Jack" returned to El Paso Tuesday,
after spending a week with her hus
band, having made the trip by auto.
INCREASE SHOWN
IN FEDERAL
BANKS
Gain Under Four Years of Democratic
Rule Shows National Prosperity;
Widespread Reports Show All Sec
tions Have Share.
Gross bank deposits of the 7.57J
federal member banks of the United
States, as reported to the comptroller
of the currency, in the call of May 1.
iit, reached the record total or
$11,135,322,000.
On the- corresponding date four
years ago, April 18, 1912, the national
bank deposits of the United State
were $8,015,511,000.
The four-year increase amounts to
$3,403,446,000.
This is approximately a gain of 39
per cent.
It is far beyond the average four-
year gain in the history of American
banking. .
Reaches Alt Sections.
The significant and highly satisfac-
tory phase of this analysis la t9 "
nation-wide character of the deposit
development. It proves that our
prosperity is not dependent upon war
exports, but reaches every geographic
division and every industrial interest
north and south, east and west.
It is natural, for example, that the
manufacturing industries of New Ens
land, whose exports to Europe have
expanded during the war, should swell
New England bank deposits to the ex
tent cf 31 per cent.
That does not explain, however,
why the deposits of the western states
including the 'Dakotas, Nebraska,
Kansas, Montana, Wyoming, Colo
rado, New Mexico and Oklahoma
have made the still greater deposit
growth of 42 per cent. i
Growth in New England. -'
The six New England states, which
have Boston as their federal reservo
center, show a four year deposit
growth of $119,858,000.. . - "'
The nine west of the Mississippi
states which pass their reserve
through the regional banks of Minne
apolis and Kansas City show a four
year deposit growth of $212,219,000.
The eastern states of New York,
Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware,
Maryland and the District of Columbia
wtieh contain the two large fed
eial reserve centers of New York and
Philadelphia, the large ' banking cen
ters of Baltimore and Washington,
and the government treasury and sub
treasuries naturally exhibit the larg
est volume and percentage of gain la
banking operations. The four year
gain in the eastern district is $1,713.
791,000 or 52 per cent. This "splendid
banking growth of the eastern section
answers the fears of those eastern
bunkers who feared that the division
oi the federal reserve system Into II
districts would injure the financial
progress of New York and Philadel
phia. . South Suffers from War.
The south has distinctly suffered
us a result of the European war be
cause of the heavy reduction in both
volume and price of export cotton.
Nevertheless, the 13 southern states
show a four year deposit gain of $218,
0S4.000, or 27 per cent.-
The eight middle west states of
Ohio. Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Wis
consin, Minnesota, Iowa and Missouri
exhibit a four year deposit growth ot
$658,103,000 or approximately 30 per
cent. . ' V .
Even the eight Pacific states,. whosa
commercial activities . have been
handicapped by the European war
through the transfer of. Pacific com
merce to the Atlantic, show normal
and healthy deposit gains aggregates
$124,426,000, or over 21 per cent.
With the close of the European war
and the return of activity to the cot
ton south and the Pacific west, and
greater national energies devoted to
internal developments, the bank de
posits of the United States under the
new federal reserve system and the
rural credits and agricultural exten
sion acts are likely to show even
stronger and more general develop
ments. 350,000 TRAINMEN
