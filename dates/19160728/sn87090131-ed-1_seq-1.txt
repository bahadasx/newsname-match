oISTORIC
CRIMES
THE DAMSEL AND THE DUNGEON.
In the year 1764 the Empress Cath
erine II was seated upon the throne
of Rusala, but not so firmly that she
really enjoyed herself. In those days
it was impossible to throw a brick
in Russia without hitting two or three
conspirators. Intrigue was a profes
sion rather than a pastime, and the
leading patriots had a disagreeable
habit of strangling and otherwise mur
dering their rulers.
So Catherine, as she sat on her
throne, reigning according to the rules
laid down by the National league, kept
close tab on all that was going on.
not only in Russia but wherever it was
possible to have her spies. She was
determined that she wouldn't be taker.
unawares. One day she received a
message from Florence, to the effect
that Prince Charles Radziwill was
paying court to Helen Tarakanoff, and
it was the general belief in Italy that
the two would soon be married.
Catherine became so agitated that
she almost upset her throne when
she sprang to her feet and shrieked an
order for Prince Gregory Orloff to
wait upon her.
Helen Tarakanoff had been the
belle of Florence and Leghorn for sev
eral seasons. Her beauty was cele

brated, eve in a country where beau
tiful women were the rule. And she
was additionally attractive because of
her pleasant disposition. She was
kind and generous, beloved by people
of all classes. She was surrounded by
mystery. There could be no question
ing her patrician descent, but her his
tory was entirely unknown. Only a
few people in the world knew th it she
was the daughter of the Empress Eliz
abeth of Russia. Catherine, of course.
was one of the few who knew the
truth, and the continued existence of
the Princess Helen was a source of
uneasiness to her. That uneasiness
now became alarm when she learned
of the projected marriage, for she
knew that Prince Charles was danger

hated Russia and the Russians worse
than poison, yet had dreams of be
coming emperor of that country. He
had set himself up as a candidate for
the throne of Poland, considering that
but a stepping stone to the place he
really coveted. It may easily be seen
how a marriage with the Princess
Helen would have been desirable in
the furthering of his schemes. He
was a bold and enterprising man, and
Catherine was afraid of him.
Prince Gregory Orloff responded to
her summons at once. He was a man
of majestic appearance, viewing him
from the front. He had all kinds of
rich brown whiskers, and a haughty
face. He had a commanding figure
and immense shoulders. But the back
of his head gave him away. It was a
straight line up and down. Prince
Gregory was one of the strongest men
the world ever saw. He could twist
iron pokers into corkscrews, and roll
heavy metal plates into balls. He
could throw a small horse over his
head. Men of average strengtn were
as children in his hands. The Orloffs
were all mighty men. It was Alexis
Orloff who absent-mindedly placed his
fingers around the neck of Peter III,
and when he removed those fingers
Peter was dead, and has been dead to
this day.
Catherine invited him to read the
message from Florence, and then
said: "Go and bring that woman to
Russia."
Gregory bowed and straightway

in Leghorn bay. He had come to the
Mediterranean merely for a frolic, he
said. He wanted to get acquainted
with the folks, and he soon 'got ac

Leghorn. Florence and other points
were at the seashore, intent upon hav
ing a good time, and they looked upon
Orloff as a great acquisition, for he
spent his money like an intoxicated
mariner and was the life and soul of
every social jamboree.
The Princess Helen, twenty years
old, and lovely as a seraph, was there
with the rest of the girls, and it soon
was evident to everybody that Orloff
was desperately in love with her. He
followed her everywhere, and made
her magnificent presents. And it soon
was equally evident that Helen was
forgetting the absent Charlie Radzi
will, and was losing her heart to the
majestic Russian. Charlie was away
somewhere, fixing his political fences,
and in this case absence failed to
make the heart grow fonder.
After a series of brilliant shore en
tertainments. Orloff invited the whole
push to a big fete on board his war
ship. It was an evening to be remem
bered. The almost barbarian magnifi
cence of Orloff and his ship made a
great impression. As the guests were
departing, Orloff begged the princess
to remain until the others were gone,
as he had a message for her. She
thought she knew what the message
was. It would be one of love; and
she seated herself tranquilly to wait.
The last guest was gone, and Orloff
approached her. But there was no
smile of love on his face or in his
eyes. The brute in his nature was
uppermost. Without a word, he seized
her wrist and dragged her roughly to
a foul hole in the bottom of the ship,
and locked a door upon her. And the
ship set out to sea.
Throughout the voyage the once
pampered and beautiful princess was
everybody's serf. She was obliged to
do all the dirty work for the cook;
to peel the vegetables and wash
dishes and scrub the floor; and the
cook, who was as great a brute as
Orloff, treated her like a dog. If she
begged for mercy, he struck her
ac" -s the mouth; and once he
di ad her about the vessel by the
hair, and Orloff looked on and
grinned.
In time the ship reached Cronstadt.
and anchored; and the night after its
arrival a boat came alongside, and the
princess was thrown into it. The boat
proceeded up the Neva to the fortress,
and there the wretched princess was
conducted along dark and noisome cor
ridors, dripping and oozing water, and
was shown into a black dungeon, wet
and foul. At the door she fell upon
her knees and begged that she might
at least know why she was persecuted,
but there was no answer. The jailors
pushed her into the dungeon, and
closed the great door upon her.
This dungeon, with the others on
the same level, was below the surface
of the Neva, and it was deathly cold,
and water was always trickling down
the walls. There was a slit in the
outer wall, near the roof, and the cold
wind whistled drearily through this
slit through the long winter days and
nights; and in the summer she could
hear the river eternally lap-lapping
against the wall of her prison. No
sound of human voice ever reached
her; food was thrown to her, as to a
caged hyena, through a wicket in the
door, too high for her to see through.
For twelve years this martyred
maiden lived there in the black dark
ness, cold and filth. For twelve years
she crawled over the slimy stones like
a reptile, and prayed for death.
But when death came she resented
it, and longed for more life. miserable
as it was. One day the Neva was in
flood. The waters rose higher than
ever before, and presently they began
to flow through the slit in the wall.
The princess saw that she was doomed
unless she could escape from the dun
geon. She tore up huge rocks that
formed the floor of the cell-rocks she
could not have stirred at ordinary
times-and threw them against the
door. A warder came and asked her
angrily what she meant, and she
pointed to the water flowing in
through the slit. "Let me out, or I
perish!" she cried.
"Nobody leaves a cell without an
oficial order," said the warder, and
the door clanged shut.
When the flood went down the ema
ciated, almost naked body of the poor
princess was taken from the dungeon
where she had drowned and was
buried by two soldiers.
And hundreds of such stories would
rouse the indignation of mankind if
the walls of Russian prisons coul
speak
