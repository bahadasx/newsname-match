With everything apparently in readi
ness for the vessel's departure, Cap-t-iin
Paul Koc-nig is waiting tonight,
it is believed, for news from another
sub-sea vessel, the Bremen.
Another indication that the homeward-bound
submersible may put into
Rome cove down the Chesapeake Bay
to await an opportune time to make
a dash o'st of the capes, is the quan
tity of coai stored on the after deck
of the tug Thomas F. Timmins. which
will top the Deutschlnnd. This is in
large sacks, possibly 100 of them. With
her bunkers full and this additional
supply, the Timmins could stand by

thrown off in her submerging opera

lighted and strains of lively music
floated over the water.

OFFICIAL PAPER ON
THE IRISH QUESTION
Was Given to the Publio by Premier
Asquith Last Night.
London, July 27, 9.32 p. m. In ac
cordance with Premier Asquith's
promise, an official paper giving the
sense of the agreement arrived at re
cently between David Lloyd George
and the Irish leaders in the Irish ne
gotiations was issued tonight. It
bears out the contention made in de
bate in the house of commons by John
Redmond with regard to the retention
of the Irish members of the imperial
parliament, inasmuch as clause four
merely says that the "Irish represen
tative in the imperial parliament shad
remain unaltered, namely, 103," and.
says nothing concerning any subse
quent increase in their number.
With regard to the duration of the
new bill, the official paper confirms
Premier Asquith's statement of JulJ
10, namely, that if parliament had not
by twelve months after the war made
a further permanent provision for tho
government of Ireland then the dur
ation of the operation of the bill shall
be extended by an order-in-couneil
for such time as may be necessary to
make such provision.
The clause referring to the exclu
sion of the Ulster counties merely de
fines the excluded counties, but says
nothing about whether the exclusion
is to be permanent.
An Interesting clause in the agree
ment not previously mentioned gives
the lord lieutenant of Ireland power
to summon conferences between mem
bers for constituencies in the exclud
ed area and members for the rest of
Ireland.
The only new feature in the Irish
situation today Is .that a petition is
bein glargely signed in the house of
commons asking for a renewal of thj
negotiations for an Irish compromise
on the lines suggested by John Red
mond and Sir Edward Carson.

British Note on
FeedingofCivilians
CABLED TO STATE DEPARTMENT
BY AMBASSADOR PAGE
PROPOSAL IS FINAL
If Teutonic Allies Will Reserve to the
Civil Populations the Products of
Their Lands, the Importation of
Foodstuffs Will bo Allowed.
London, July 28, 12.09 a. m. Walter
Hines Page, tho American arnhasBador,
has cabled to the state department at
Washington tho text of a letter from
the foreign office regarding the feed
ing of the civilian populations in ter
ritory occupied by Germans. The let
ter, which has been given out for pub
lication in newspapers of London to
day, says:
"His majesty's government deolres
to settle, once for all, the whole ques
tion of the importation of foodstuffs
into territory in the occupation of the
enemy. Therefore, it makes the fol
lowing final proposal:
"If the Uerman and Austro-Hunga-rian
governments will reserve wholly
to the civil populations of occupied
territories the entire produce of the
soil, all livestock and all stocks of
food, fodder and fertilizers in those
territories, and if they will admit to
those territories neutrals selected by
the president of the United States with
full powers to control the distribution
of food to the Whole population and to
transfer from one territory to another
surplus stocks existing in one and
lacking in the other, and if the presi
dent of the United States will under
take the selection of these agents, his
majesty's government will give Lhem
every assistance and admit into such
territories any imported food supplies
necessary to supplement native stocks
and afford the population a fair sub
sistence ration, as long as it is satis
fied that the enemies are scrupulously
observing their part of the agreement.
"If this offer is refused or a reply
delayed until the harvest in the occu
pied territory begins to be gathered,
his majesty's government will hold
them responsible and will exact such
reparation as can be secured by the
allied arms or enforced by the opinion
of the neutral world for every civilian
life lost through insufficient nourish
ment in the territory occupied."
DIVISION OF COUNTRY INTO
12 LAND BANK DISTRICTS
Will Be Undertaken Soon by the Fed
eral Farm Loan Board.
Washington, July 27. Division of the
country into 12 federal land bank dis
tricts and location of federal land
banks in each of them under the new
rural credits law will be undertaken
socn by the federal farm loan board,
four of whose members were nomi
nated today by President Wilson. Sec
retary McAdoo, who as an ex-officio
member completes the board, said to
night, however, that he believed it
would be impossible to conclude or
ganization of tMe system in less than
six months, and that it might not be
in actual operation before next spring.
The four men nominated today as
members of the board are Charles E.
Lobdell of Kansas, George W. Norris
of Pennsylvania, W. S. A. Smith of
Iowa and Herbert Quick of Wrest Vir
ginia. The president is expected to
designate either Mr. Norris or Mr.
Quick, the democratic members of the
board, to act as farm loan commis
sioner and executive head of the farm
loan system.
Until the senate acts upon the nom
inations no date for a meeting can be
set, but it was believed probable to
night that the members would get to
gether within two weeks. Hearings on
the designation of districts and the
location of banks probably will begin
some time in September. The first of
these is expected to be held here and
most of the state capitals probably will
be visited before they are concluded.
That will require several months and
other technical steps provided in the
not preliminary to actual organization
of the banks probably will prevent op
eration of the system before February
or March.
NOTE PROTESTING THE
BLACKLISTING OF AMERICANS
Will be Presented to the British For
eign Office, Probably Today,
Washington, July 27. American
Ambassador Page will present to the
British foreign office, probably tomor
row, a .note protesting against the
blacklisting of American, -business
firms under the Trading with the En
emy Act. In announcing today that
the communication had been trans
mitted to London, Acting Secretary
Polk said it discussed only the gen
eral principles of international law in
volved, without specifically taking up
cases of individual firms blacklisted.
The note officially descriDed at the
department as "a protest" is said au
thoritatively to be positive in tenor
and to leave no doubt regarding this
go'ernment's attitude. It is about 1,
000 words in length. Present plans
are to make it public next Monday.
While officials are reticent regard
ing details of the representations
made, it was understood' this "govern
ment's view that illegal restrictions
are imposed by the blacklist ordeiTpn
the freedom pf American ' trade is set
forth in vigorous "terms. Some modi
fication of the order', "It ' Is Relieved, is
insisted upon. There have been indi
cations that should diplomatic effior'ts

GAVE NEW YORK THE ATMOS
PHERE OF A TURKISH BATH
HUMIDITY RECORD OF 98
Damp Air Took Starch Out of Linen,
tha Shape Out of Panama Hats and
the Energy Out of Humanity Wave
Was Country-wide. yr
A
New York, July 27. A combination
of intense humidity enveloped New
York today in the atmosphere of a
Turkish bath. Only once, in July,
896, has the humidity been higher than
the record reached today 93, and the
air, even when the sun was shining
fiercely, seemed to ooze out a caloric
wetness that took the starch out of
linen, the shape out of Panama hats
and the energy out of everybody.
The thermometer and the hydro
meter moved upward together, the
former registering 85. The humidity
record was the culmination of a fort
night of such weather that has caused
New York more than the usual dis
comfort that accompanies July heat.
WORST HEAT WAVE
IN FIFTEEN YEARS
Oppressive From Atlantic Seaboard to
the Rooky Mountains.
Washington, July 27. A "Bermuda
high" is the official cause of the worst
heat wave that has enveloped the
country in fifteen years. Translated
from the cryptic language of the
weather sharps, that means a great
area of high pressure air has been
mobilizing on the weather drill grounds
in the Atlantic off Bermuda for the
last month and now has let go the
full power of its offensive from the
seaboard to the Rocky Mountains.
For weeks it has stood like a solid
wall against heated currents trying
vainly to move out from the interior
over the ocean and now as it swirls
rapidly along it is gathering heat and
moisture from the tropics and sweep
ing them northward over the conti
nent into the vacuum of so-called
low-pressure areas."
No relief is promised from the phe
nomena which in the east has caused
sweltering eity dwellers to light fires
in their homes to dry out the humidity,
or which in the Mississippi valley is
threatening to destroy millions of
dollars worth of food crops. Chief
Forecaster Frankenfield.. .. said - today
tiiat the heat wave had only begun.
It is certain to continue through the
week and probably longer. None of
conditions essential to a breakup are
yet evident. The ralief which often
comes frcm tho northwest is nowhere
in sight.
HOT SPELL SEVERE
IN MIDDLE WEST.
Relief Promised for the North Plains
States by Saturday.
'Chicago, July 27. The north plains
states will enjoy .slight relief from the
present hot wave toy 'Saturday, but
there is no indication of any relief for
Missouri, Illinois, Iowa, Wisconsin or
Kansas, the forecaster at tile local
government weather bureau said to
night. The hot spell which fell on the mid
dle west on the first of July was more
severe today than at any time since
its inception.
Every government weather bureau
in Indiana reported 100 degrees, Pierre,
S. D., Grand Rapids, Iich, and Daven
port, la., each reported 102 degrees,
and with the absence of appreciable
lake breezes the mercury in Chicago
rose to the 10 mark and broke all
records since 1911.
At 7 o'clock tonight, according to
the local bureau, every government
weather station between the AUeghe
nies and the Rocky mountains report
ed a maximum of 90 degrees or more.
101 at Peoria, III.
Peoria, 111., July 27. At 1 o'clock
this afternon the weather bureau re
ported a temperature of 101 here and
at Freeport.
Factories Close Because of Heat.
Oshkosh, Wis., July 27. A number
of factories, were obliged to shut down
at noon today, as the men could not
endure the heat, some of the rooms
having temperatures of 107 and 108,
STRONG PROTEST AGAINST
THE BRITISH BLACKLIST
From the Petroleum Products Com
pany of San Francisco.
London, July 27, 6.53 p. m. Among

attitude of President "Wilson in sup
porting the liberal response of the
senate to the call for adequate de
fense. The Appropriations.

that the man answers the descriptions

cention that his right thumb is am-'

eerning the murderer with the excep- j
tion of the left thumb. i
