HARMONY A FEATURE OF MEETING
Reports Made by Stone and Sie Show
Excellent Results Accomplished
Despite Market Conditions
The two significant feature! of the
meeting of tbe Apple Grower Associa
tion called Saturday for tbe nomina
tion of candidates for the board of di
rectors who wili be elected at tbe an
nual meeting of stockholders on April
1, were tbe evidences of harmony and
the appeals made by Sales Manager
Sieg and Executive manager Stone to
growers to exert every effort towsrd
better spraying and securing a bigber
per entage of high grade fruit.
Ibe meeting was tbe most harmoni
ous ever beld among fruit growers in
Hood Kiver. Not a grower lifted bis
voiee in an expression of dissatisfac
tion. Despite the fact tnat tbe crop of
tbe past season was over 100.000 boxes
smaller than those of 1913 and 1914,
Mr. Stone s report showed tbat han
dling costs bad been reduced by the
Association this year to the lowest in
tbe history of tbe northwest. The av
erage cost of handling applet the past
season, when 873,200 boxes formed tbe
organization's total tonnage, reached
but 3 cents and 4.7 mills per box.
Mr. bieg in discussing tbe success of
the organisation in securing top prices
for its product, declared that the re
sults were due to a decision on tbe part
of local growers to withdraw from col
lective agencies and conduct the sale
and distribution of their fruits through
tbeir own channels. He pointed out
that at present the orgainsation has
four personal representatives: S. b.
oomaw, ot London: H. t. Davidson
in New York; W. M. Dickerson, San
Hrancieco, and C. W. Hooker, Los An
geles.
"Ibere never will be a collective
agency, said Mr. Sieg, that can
serve separate fruit growing districts
and do justice to all.
Mr. Meg stated tbat Hood Hiverlhad
received better prices for its pears tbe
pust season than any other dietnet,
local fancy d Anioua bavins brought
an average of $2.21 cents per box.
bod grant tbat the war may stop.
said Mr. Sieg, wben discussing the
outlook the coming season for local
Newlwons. I he inability of barrel
growers as well as northwestern ship
pers to secure space for exportation ot
ltuit be characterised as cause ot much
ot the disastrous condition of the close
of tbe present marketing season.
"England will take our Newtowns,"
he asid, "for they are considered a
necessary adjunct to anEr.glish table."
Mr. Meg voiced the most optimistic
expressions as to the coming season's
strawberry sales, when Kennewick, tbe
hrst northwestern district to make
commercial shipments of the fruit, Un
derwood and White Salmon and the
local associations would work toward
keeping the market stable at all times.
A novel system of aiding the grower
members of tbe Association was pro
posed by Mr. Stone, who suggested
tnat a tax of a cent per package on all
products be levied to form an auxiliary
loan fund, this matter will be voted
on at tbe annual meeting.
following ib a list of average returns
per box received on all fruit for the
season of 1915, including the re-pective
grades, extra tancy, fancy and C grade,
in all sizes uptolba: SpitzenburgB,
$1.86. $1.65 and $1.14; Newtowns,
$1.68, $1.27 and $1.02; Arkansas black,
$1.96, $1.60 a.iU $1.19; Jonathans, $1.31,
$1.11 and $1; Ortleys, $1.49, $1.28 and
$1.07; Winter bananas, $1.92, $1.65 and
$ 88; Delicious, $1.83, $1.38 and $1.07;
Baldwins, $1.32, $1.11 and $ 76; Red
Cheek, $1.68, $1.18 and $.94; Miscel
laneous, fancies, $1.01 and C grade,
$.76. In the miscellaneous stock, con
sisting of some 60 varieties, no extra
tancy pack was made.
Nominations for the board of direc
tors were as follows: P. S. Davidson,
H. F. Davidson, J. C. Porter, O. b.
Nye, K. H. Wallace, Oscar Vanderbilt,
A. G. Lewis, W. b. Dickerson, C. A.
Heed, Walter Kimball, E. H. Shepard,
K. W. birge, J. E. Hull, J. K. Nona
maker, A. F. Bickfotd, A. C. Staten,
E. It. Moller, A. D. Kamsey and C. E.
Copple. The entire old board, of which
the first 10 men are memrjers, was
nominated. L. E. Clark, however, who
has been on boards of shipping agen
cies since the days of the old Apple
Growers Union, withdrew bis name.
Ihe bylaws require at least six old
members to be elected, but not more
than nine.
Mr. Clark was given a unanimous
vote of thanks for his long service in
the interest of Hood River fruit grow
ers. The prices on fruits given above are
not net to growers. From the figures
given tbe charges of advertising, two
cents per box, handling charges of 10
cents and the one eignin oi a cent per
box to go to the Northwestern Fruit
Growers' Council, must be deducted.
Ihe storage cost, ranging from sero to
a maximum of eight cents, must also
be deducted.
As shown from the report of Mr.
Stone, the grower members of the As
sociation are $7,398.16 better off from
the 1914 pools than tbey thought at the
time the same were closed last yesr.
A number of carloads of fruit being
shipped to Copenhagen were seized by
the British government, who considered
that the utlimate destination of the
product was Germany. The spples were
diverted to other points and sold by the
British government. The sum given
above is tbe amount returned from the
sales. It is being held in local banks
to the credit of the Association, who
however, have given bond tbat it will
be repaid, in case claims now in the
bands of consular departments of tbe
sovernment are not settled satisfac
torilv. It is possible that claims of the
Association, because the British gov
ernment s sales did not return an
amount as large as that expected from
the price originally sent on tbe fruit.
may result in an even larger surplus
than S7.3J8.16.
Mr. Sieg reports "that a carload of
Winter Nellis pears shipped to England
last fall were detained by tbe British
government for 30 days and were finally
docked in a poor condition. Because of
this the pools of the Association on
; Winter Nellis wore closed at $1 per
' box. A claim has been registered, end
this sum may be materially increased
) The report of Mr. Stone showed tbat
the salaries' psid by the Association
reached $8,250 fur the ofl3cs fores, and
$3,700 at ths warehouse. In consider
ing this mstter P. S. Davidson, who
presided at Saturday's meeting, ststed
that tbe board of directors should not
be considered extravagant; that the
salaries psid should be considered in
tbe light of services rendered and the
efficiency of the force" employed. Mr.
Davidson complimented tbe different
departments of the organization on tbe
manner in which they bad cooperated
for tbe best interests of the organisa
tion during tbe past year.
In bis talk Saturday afternoon Mr.
Sieg warned against tbe evil of over
estimation. He called attention to tbe
figures compiled by Gordon C Corba-
ley, ol bpokane, who baa placed the
northwest s crop of spples ail the way
from 23.000 to 36.000 carloada. Mr.
Sieg pointed out that the facts of acre
age would make such statements physi
cally impossible.
Mr. Sieg told of tbe burlful practice
of misbranding of local apples tbe past
year, some cooking grade fruit having
been sent to England by growers in
boxes placarded with labels almost par
allel with those of the Diamond brands
of tbe Association. The exporters bad
used a heart instead of a diamond, and
had made the statements that extra
fancy, Hood River's best apples, had
been shipped, wben In fact the stock
was cooking grade in quality. He also
pointed out tbat Association brands had
been used in private shipments made to
Portland. It is likely that such prac
tice will lead to prosecution by the
United States because of the violation
of Pure Food laws, and the Oregon
Dairy and food Commission is now
making shippers of such misbranded
product repack the fruit.
Mr. bieg said that the Association
was looking out for South American
business, but that it promised at pres
ent only to deal with buyers there on
an f. o. b. New York basis, receiving
tbeir pay on delivery at the Atlantic
seaboard, having the fruit inspected
there He said that Australia bad leg-
slated against the Nortbestern box.
and tbat Washington districts, because
of their early maturity, were shipping
fruit there in boxeB made to conform
to requirements.
Mr. Meg urged members of the Asso
ciation to heed calls for estimates, te li
ng of the results of their failures to do
so with respect to crops of last year.
Mr. Kimball made a report of tbe re
cent advertising campaign begun by
the Association in fortland.
EXCHANGE HURRY
ING TO CLOSE POOLS
The Fruit Growers' Exchange is
busy winding up tbe season's pools in
an effort to live up to their policy of
getting returns back to their growers
n the shortest spsce of time.and wind
ing up their season's business before
their annual meeting, which is held on
the 27th of this month.
Kenneth McKay, the manager, ssvs:
"Returns for the season are very grat
ifying, in keeping with the grades, and
I am very certain tbat Exchange mem
bers will feel the benefit of their sell
ing methods, which will again show by
results the saneness and correctness of
these methods.
'We admit we were somewhat
alarmed at bearish talk of extremely
nign prices at tbe beginning of the
season, at not being able to reconcile
them with actual market conditions
but we kept our adopted policy of sell-
ng 75 per cent of our better grades at
he time of harvest at tbe highest
prices obtainable. This we accom
plished by participating in the famous
Skookum sale early in the season. I
only wish our growers would be al
lowed to include all our extra fancy
apples under this brand, which amply
proved to us this year its success by
selling on tbe same market as other
lesser advertised brands at 80 cents
per box advance.
"1 believe when Hood River growers
realize the true nature of this Skookum
selling method, and understand how
greatly Hood River preserves her own
identity absolutely, that they will take
to it exclusively. It's results that the
grower looks to nowadays, not argu
ments held on the street corners.
"Scab bas proved the 'thorn in our
flesh' this past season, caused especial
ly by providing grades to take care of
t, but not having uniform grade
names. Having so many scabby ap
ples this yesr (our records show tbat
nearly 75 per cent of apples shipped
ast year were so infected), forced us
to look for and develop close markets,
as we could not compete with eastern
markets with inferior fruits. With.the
aid of our central agency, we adopted
numerous and new methods for forcing
tbe sale of this fruit, to an extent that
was beyond even our expectations, and
with results that the methods will now
be adopted entirely throughout tbe
whole Belling system.
"We will have all business cleaned
up, and returns on everything, with
the possible exception of Newtowns,
sent to our members by the end of this
month.
"Looking to the coming yesr. we
confidently figure on handling 300 cars
of apples, which will place us in a
position now to have all our methods
on a comparsble basis. We are fully
equipped for handling this amount, and
naturally our expenses will decrease
all the time, with the added tonnsge
which we have actually got signed up
for this year.
"As to strawbernes.awe are more
than enthusiastic over our prospects
and are gratified at tbe new strawberry
tonnage signed this year, which in
cludes a voluntary unsolicited tonnage
from Japanese growers. In this mat
ter also, we shall not be under the
handicaps of the past, due to small
tonnage.
"We are extremely gratified to bear
that the Milton association has also
signed with the Northwestern Fruit
Exchange, for they competed with us
at lower prices last year, and now we
will be assured ot orderly control and
mutual understanding, in tbe same
manner as we now have with our
fr rends over at Mosier, wbo, although
using the same system as ours, and
pioducing tbe same varieties, under
almost the same conditions, have never
conflicted with us, but rather bas there
been actual coordination.
"Tbe snow and excessive moisture
this winter is encoursging to our grow
ers, and with all cooperating in a sens
ible csmpaign against diseases, which
will assure us of better fruit and cor
respondingly better prices, tht. outlook
for (he coming season is very hopeful."

SCHOOL BuARD
ISENDORSED
MASS MEETING IS WEI1 ATTENDED
Citizens are Found to Favor Building the
of Even Better High School
Than That Proposed
The citizens who crowded the Com
mercial club assembly hall at the mass
meeting called last Friday night to
consider tbe proposed construction of
better buildings for the accommodation
of city schools, were found to be in
even a more enthusiastic state of mind
over buildings than the board itself,
and numerous suggestions were made
that instead of expending a sum of
$25,000 twice or three times such an
amount should be obtained by bond is
sue and a high school building, to
which we might point with pride, be
erected.
The meeting was presided over by
Frank A. Cram, who in his introduc
tory remarks ststed that the members
of the school board felt that as servants
of the people they had no right to pro
ceed with any definite plana without
first learning the will of the people.
Mr. Cram said, however, that if it was
found to be the deisre of the citizens
snd taxpayers to have better buildings
the board was in position to secure
suitable.property. He told the citizens
present at the mass meeting that six
lots, known as the McDonsld property
on Eugene street, and two lots belong
ing to Mrs. E. E. Patterson adjoining
them, were available for a structure to
take the place of the Park street build
ing. Additional adequate aites for
high school structures, he said, might
be secured by tbe purchase of a full
block located just south of the present
high scbool building.
S. A. Mitchell, a member of the Parent-Teacher
Association committee
which recently made a report as to the
inadequacy of existing buildings.placed
ihe report before the meeting Friday
evening, adding to it his personal re
marks to the effect that better build
ings were very much needed. He
called attention to the fact that at
present it is necessary for children to
cross Ninth street going to and from
the Christian church, where a room has
been secured for the accomodation of a
class of grade pupils. He further
pointed out that about 400 children were
attending school on a plot of ground
about 200 feet square.
"This is far too small," said Mr.
Mitchell, "and we need at least a block
for this number."
Mr. Mitchell was followed by Mrs.
Alma Howe, who Mr. Cram said in his
introductory remarks, has given more
thought to schools than any ten mothers
in the district.
Mrs. Howe declared that the Park
street building was located at one of
the most dangerous points in the city.
She pointed out that Ninth street was
one heavily traveled by automobiles
and teams from the entire West Side.
Furthermore, she said that since the
extension of Eugene street to the east
had been opened there was danger of
the children being injured by possible
runaway teams.
"If one child should be killed hare."
said Mrs. Howe, "and I sincerely hope
that no such accident occurs, we would
forget about money matters."
Mrs. Howe told of the crowded con
dition of the grade schools, which, as
she stated made it impossible for the
teachers to know the needs of indi
vidual pupils. She said that every
last available bit of spare, even to the
basement halls, had been utilized at
the high school. s
"There is no room for exercise, she
said, "and three grades at present
taught there should be moved to some
other quarters."
She proposed that stables should be
built conveniently for students who
ride injfrom tbe country, snd that a
plot of ground for agricultural exper
iments be secured.
Dr. Jenkins, who will next year be
chairman of the school board, prefaced
his remarks with the statement that he
wished every one present would have
to serve six months on the body.
"We would then have no trouble," he
said. "What are we working for?"
continued Dr. Jenkins. "It is our chil
dren. We strive to give them better
than we had. This forms our greatest
pleasure in life."
He ended his statements by praising
the teaching force of the city schools,
declaring that in no place in Oregon of
tbe size were better teachers to be
found.
Dr. Dumble, formerly chairman of
the school board, who stated that he bad
probably served as long in school work
as any man present, said: "I was
opposed to the building of a gym
nasium severs! years ago, but when it
comes to a matter of school rooms, it is
quite a different matter, and if we have
any assurance that we are going to
continue to have the patronage of coun
try pupils I for one am favorable to
the construction of good school build
ings. The county pupils will contribute
sufficient funds to pay the interest on
any bond issue we msy see fit to vote.
Let us build a good building while we
are about it. Our present structure is
no better adapted to the purposes of a
high scbool than a livery barn would
be."
Dr. Dumble also suggested that a
small one or two room scbool, perhaps
in conjunction with the Pine Grove
school district, be constructed for tbe
accommodation oi small children resid
ing on the East Side.
Later in the evening Dr. Dumble
stated that he did not think the funds
being asked for in their tentative sug
gestions by the board were enough.
He ststed that he thought it would take
at least $50,000 for an adequate school
building.
C. D. Nickelsen recalled that he at
tended a little school house near tha
brewery at The Dalles. He remem
bered the importance of that little
building and heartily endorsed tbe bast
Side small school. Mr. Nickelsen ex
pressed the opinion that Hood River to
have a structure that could be pointed
to with pride, should expend $75,000 or
$100,000.
C. D. Hoyt, who declared that he
had been privileged to attend a very
good high school and the first manual
training school established in the coun
try, said it went against the grain
with him to send bis boys to a school
where the fscilities for work were so
poor. Mr. Hoyt declared that he
