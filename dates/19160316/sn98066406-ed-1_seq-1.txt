Work of County Agriculturist
Considerable time during the week
ending March 11th was snent in mak-
iug arrangements for the pruning and
gralting demonstrations which are be
ine held this week. There was found
to be a wide spread interest in this
work, and meetings were planned in
eight different townships. Letters were
written from this othce to the people in
each victnity, whom it was thought
might -be interested, requesting them
to advertise the matter with their neigh
bors, and at this writing there is every
indication that these meetings will be
among the most interesting and proti
table events in the work this year.
Later in the season, demonstrations
along the lines of spraying, thinning,
and packing will be made with a view
to rounding out a complete program for
those interested in fruit growing.
Another line of work that was en
gaged in during the week was the test
ing of the dairy herd at the County
Farm at Goodells for tuberculosis.
This was done in accordance with the
resolution adopted at the last October
meeting of the Hoard of Supervisors
requiring the County Agriculturist to
make this test. A definite plan is be
ing developed in regard to the manner
of handling this work throughout the
county, and this will be announced and
explained in the near future. A por
tion of the time was occupied in the
office taking care of matters that, on
account of the institutes and schools
during the past few months, has of
necessity been largely neglected.
That the seed corn situation is ex
ceedingly serious is common knowledge
yet it may be worth while to remind
those who have not yet secured their
seed of the importance of arranging it
at the earliest possible moment. All
who have any of the 1914 crop on hand
can, without doubt, obtain their seed
by selecting good ears and testing at
least five kernels from each one and
discarding all that do not show good
germinating qualities. The ear test is
especially important with 1915 corn as
tests already conducted show a germi
nation in many cases of less than 50
per cent. This otllce is in touch with a
few reliable sources from which com
for planting can be obtained, but the
County Agent will be powerless to help
the people along these lines unless they
make their wants known at once.
