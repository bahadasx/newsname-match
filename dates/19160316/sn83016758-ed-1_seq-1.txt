Princeton H. S. Defeats Milaca in a
Close Game at the Arm-
ory Friday Evening.
Co. and P. H. S. Quints Stage Fast
Contest on Tuesday Evening
Militia Boys Win.
For real thrills and doubtfulness of
outcome the recent village election had
nothing on the Milaca-Princeton bas
ket ball game at the Armory last Fri
day evening. Of course Princeton won,
but only after one of the most spirit
ed contests ever staged on the local
floor, and then by a margin so nar
row that the glory was almost equally
^shared by the opposing high school
quints. The final count was 13 to 12.
The locals were somewhat over
confident, and did not play up their
usual form, and were not particularly
favored by the breaks of the game.
Milaca, on the other hand, showed up
stronger than was expected, and a
rattling good contest was the result.
Play commenced shortly after 9
o'clock, with Morton, captain of the
team, and Prof. Watson of Milaca act
ing as officials. Princeton broke into
the score column first, when Jesmer,
the fast and clever right forward, lo
cated the net for a field goal. Shortly
thereafter Raiche penetrated the Mil
aca defense and propelled the ball
through the basket. Milaca fouled,
Raiche accepted a chance at a free
throw without missing, and the count
stood five for the orange and black
representatives to a cipher for the up
-country athletes. At this stage of the
game prospects were exceedingly
bright from a Princeton viewpoint,
but during the remainder of the half
Milaca put on an extra spurt of speed
and came within one point of dividing
honors evenly. Cravens started the
scoring for the visitors by negotiat
ing a field goal, and Berg for Prince
ton followed suit a few minutes there
after, making Princeton's total seven.
Milaca shortened the distance between
the two teams when Flink heaved the
ball through the net, and during the
remaining minutes the visitors were
the aggressors. Before time was call
Cravens again located the net, and
when the first priod ended the score
stood seven to six in favor of Prince
ton.
Directly after the time-keeper's
whistle sounded, Milaca negotiated
another basket, and had it been made
a few seconds sooner, Milaca would
have had the long end of the score for
the first half, and the game.
The final period was a sizzler, and
for 20 minutes the opposing sides bat
tled fast and furious to a six to six
tie. At times the enthusiasm of the
spectators knew no bounds, and dur
ing the last few minutes the uproar
was deafening.
Princeton started its scoring ma
chine early in this half also, but later
on for a time all the cylinders were
missing. Raiche made a free throw
good, and Jesmer raised the hopes of
local enthusiasts by tossing a field
goal. Raiche again took a free throw
at the net with marked success, and
Princeton had a lead of five points.
Milaca was still decidedly in the run
ning, however, as the next few min
utes showed, as Cravens proceeded to
cover himself wjth glory by locating
the net three times in succession, and
Milaca had a lead of one for the first
time since play started. Only a couple
.of minutes of play remained, and the
local followers were enthusiastic but
hardly hopeful. The visitors were go
ung strong, while Princeton's greatly
advertised team work was conspicu
ous by its absence. Raiche, realizing
that a victory for Milaca meant the
shattering" of a time-honored prece
dent, rose to the occasion nobly, how
ever, and when only a couple of min
utes remained secured the ball in the
center of the floor, adjusted his sights
and took a long shot at the net. It
was a perfect throw, and the wind in
flated sphere sailed through the loop
scarcely touching the sides. It was
a startling finish to a thrilling game,
and brought the entire crowd to its
feet. It also brought victory to
Princeton, and joy to the local fol
lowers of the in-door game.

Co. vs. the High School.
For the first time this season Co.
G's powerful basket ball team and the
rapid fire high school quint opposed
each other in a regular game at the
Armory Tuesday evening, and a large
and enthusiastic gathering of fans en
joyed every minute of play. The con
test was a real exhibition of basket
ballboth fives going at top speed.
The soldier boys being more experi
enced and heavier had a natural ad
vantage, but the high school lads wag
ed an aggressive game and the
quint was forced to travel right along
to annex the long end of a 24 to 16
Play started shortly after 9 o'clock,
and the high school lads cleared the
deck for action right at the outset.
Berg and Winsor each located the net
before the boys got squared around.
Newton and Morton got within range
of the basket shortly thereafter, how
ever, and tied the score, and forged
ahead when Smith counted for a field
goal. Raiche evened things up again
when he negotiated a basket, but be
fore the period ended, Smith, the
husky militia forward, stowed away
the honors for the first half by count
ing twice. The score when time was
called stood 10 to 6 in favor of G.
traveled particularly fast during
the final period, and at times the high
school performed in sensational style.
Wilkes started things by planting the
ball through the hoop shortly after
play started, but orange and black
stock soared a few minutes later when
Berg and Raiche each negotiated field
goals from difficult angles. At this
stage of the dame the high school de
fense appeared to be slightly demor
alized for a time, with the result that
Doane and Morton counted once each
and Newton twice, in rapid succession.
Raiche and Jesmer came right back
for the high school with a field goal
each, and then Newton wound up G's
scoring by tossing another basket.
During the final minutes of play
Raiche again counted, and the score
for this period was 14 to 10, while the
final count was 24 to 16
NOTES.
Manager Hofflander informs us that
this was G's last game for this sea
son. The boys had a successful year,
and appreciate the generous support
of the public.
"Pongo" Olson and Dave Umbe
hocker acted as referee and umpire, re
spectively, and all kicks registered
were carefully filed away. The offi
cials had no snap, but both did very
well.
It is rather doubtful if the high
school engages in*any more contests
this season. A game was to have
been played at Milaca tomorrow even
ing, but it was canceled as no suitable
hall is available. The local lads have
a record for the season that is more
than creditable. Several times they
have by sheer cleverness overcome
heavier and more experienced teams,
and each one of the players has
done stellar work. Those of them who
have not figured prominently in the
scoring line, have held down the guard
position in a gratifying manner.
Fatal Accident.
A sad accident occured last Friday
afternoon in the town of Stanford,
Isanti county, in which Fred C, son
of Mr. and Mrs. Fred Most, lost his
life. It appears that the ill-fated
young man and Ernest Busch were
sawing trees for logs on the Most
farm. A tree that they had felled
toppled over, and a large splinter was
hurled through the air) striking Fred
on the side of the head. His neck was
broken, and death resulted almost in
stantly.
Funeral services were conducted
from the German Lutheran church in
Stanford, Tuesday afternoon, and in
terment was in the Crown cemetery.
Fred Most was born in Stanford 19
years ago, and was a young man who
enjoyed the friendship of all who had
formed his acquaintance. That he
should be removed from earthly scenes
in such unexpected and shocking a
manner is indeed to be regretted. The
parents, four sisters and a brother
survive him.
Anent Teachers' Retirement Fund.
The following communication receiv
ed by County Superintendent Ewing,
from the office of E. T. Critchett, secre
tary of the Minnesota Teachers' Insur
ance and Retirement Fund, is self
explanatory, and will doubtless prove
interesting to those engaged in the
teaching profession:
"It is optional with teachers who
were employed in the public schools of
Minnesota during the school year 1914-
1915, and who were employed on April
20, 1915, whether they join the Retire
ment Fund or not. All teachers em
ployed after the passage of that law,
who were not employed during the
school year 1914-1915, automatically
become members of the Fund and as
such must pay assessment."
R. C. DUNN, Publisher. Terms, $1.00 Per Year. PRINCETON, .MILLE LACS COUNTY, MINNESOTA, THURSDAY, MARCH 16, 1916
MWBEnEECTED President of Village Council Over C. S.
Neumann by a Majority of
Only One Vote.
G. H. Gottwerth, Geo. P. Ross and
J. A. Smith Chosen Trus-
teesTotal Vote 312.
The annual village election Tues
day was not without interest, al
though the license auestion was not
an issue, and a total of 312 votes were
polled as compared to 398 a year ago.
There were a multiplicity of tickets
and candidates in the field but chief
interest centered in the contest for
the presidency of the council between
i.fayor Henry Newbert and Dr. C. S.
Neumann. G. H. Pennison was also
a candidate but re was generally con
ceded that one of the first two named
would be the winner. When the count
was completed the tally sheet show
ed that there was a difference of only
one vote between the two leading may
orality candidates, and this vote was
in Mayor Newbert's column. This is
an extremely narrow margin, and
there is talk of a recount. It is doubt
ful, however, if a recount would
change the result.
Of the old council G. H. Gottwerth
was re-elected, and his colleagues will
be Geo. P. Ross and J. A. Smith. Frank
Henschel refused to run for re-election
and Councilman Oscar Stark was out
distanced by Mr. Smith, who came
under the wire with four votes to
spare. Smith's election came as a
surprise to some, as he was an elev
enth-hour candidate. Messrs. Gott
werth, Ross and Smith are level-head
ed business men and the affairs of the
village will be in able hands while they
serve. Mr. Stark was appointed to
the council to fill the vacancy created
by Mr. Newbert's elevation to the
presidency, and filled the position
creditably.
Treasurer J. C. Herdliska was re
elected without opposition and Re
corder Cravens was re-elected over
Ray Bockoven by a substantial ma
jority. Mr. Bockoven's name was
placed on two sets of ballots by his
friends, without his knowledge, we
are informed, and under the circum
stances the outcome was not surpris
ing. Messrs. Herdliska and Cravens are
competent to discharge the duties of
their respective offices in a faultless
manner, and can be depended upon to
do the right thing
John Kaliher was elected justice of
the peace, and L. F. Wilkes had easy
going for re-election as constable. Jus
tice Dickey's name did not appear upon
more than one of the tickets, which
proved considerable of a handicap.
Hereunder appears a table of the
candidates and the votes received by
them: Mayor

Fred Keith and Herman Hofflander
acted as clerks of the election, and Ira
G. Stanley, Rufus P. Morton and A.
M. Davis were the judges, and proved
to be a competent and efficient elec
tion board. The village count was
completed at 8:15three hours and
15 minutes after the polls closed. Con
sidering the mixture of candidates,
they are to be commended upon their
promptness.
A fair sized crowd of spectators
was on hand during the count, and
watched proceedings with interest.
Messrs. Newbert and Neumann ran
neck and neck throughout the count,
and alternated in maintaining a lead
of a few votes. They were tied at sev
eral stages, and interest was more
than keen when the last few votes
were reached.
The race between Messrs. Smith
and Stark was second in interest, and
at no time did a great margin separate
the two candidates. Both Smith and
Newbert gained after the last 10 or
15 ballots were reached.
The election passed off quietly, and
there are no indications that there are
any sore spots. This is as it should
be, and all should co-operate with the
council in making Princeton more de
sirable as a place of residence than

A Pleasant Affair.
The reception given at the Armory
Saturday evening for the board of ed
ucation of Independent district No. 1
and the faculty of the Princeton
schools, by the Woman's Civic Better
ment club was a most enjoyable affair.
The Armory was appropriately decor
ated for the occasion, and the high
school orchestra furnished pleasing
music during the evening.
Refreshments were served and Miss
es Mary Shockley and Etta Davis pre
sided at the punch bowls with their
usual charm.
The teachers and board of education
were pleased to be given an oppor
tunity to meet the patrons of the
school in a social way, the only regret
being that more parents were not in
attendance.
At the close of the reception a short
but entertaining program was carried
out. Mr. S. S. Petterson and the high
school orchestra favored those present
with several*! selections delightfully
rendered, and were generously ap
plauded. Mrs. H. L. Cowles, the pre
siding officer, gave a short talk out
lining the purpose* and object of the
club and Atorney E. L. McMillan,
Mayor Newbert and Supt. Marshall re
sponded, giving much encouragement
to the new organization.
The club desires to thank those who
assisted them in making the affair a
success, and especially are-the mem
bers grateful to Co. for generously
allowing them the use of the Armory.
TOWNSHIPJESULTS
Princeton Town Meeting, Held in Vil-
lage, is Well Attended by Rep-
resentative Farmers.
Election Returns From Various Points
in the Counties of Mille Lacs
Sherburne and Isanti.
The annual election of Princeton
township on Tuesday passed off quiet
ly, and only 141 votes were polled.
Last year the total vote was 217, but
the "wet" and "dry" question was then
an issue.
There were three candidates for
supervisor to succeed Wm. Klingbeil,
the retiring member, and Henry Kun
kel was returned the winner, but he
had only one vote to spare. The vote
was as follows: Henry Kunkel, 51
Peter Henschel, 50 Reinhart Manke,
37. Mr. Klingbeil was not a candidate
for re-election, but he leaves the posi
tion with an excellent record.
Albert Kuhfield, the popular and
efficient town clerk, had no opposition
for re-election. He has served for
years, and being thoroughly familiar
with township affairs makes an ex
cellent clerk. Dave Wetter was also
re-elected treasurer without opposi
tion.
No names appeared upon the ballot
for justices of the peace, but 12 voters
wrotes in the name of Michael Ma
honey, and six voted for O. L. Bye, and
these two were declared elected. M.
B. Cater also received one vote. There
is no doubt but what Mike possesses
judicial temperament in a marked de
gree, and he also has the requisite
dignity.
The constable space on the ballot
was also blank, and George Schmidt
was elected, receiving eight votes.
Carl Rick and Leonard Reed receiv
ed six each.
Wm. Klingbeil, Henry Marpe and
Fred Eggert acted as judges of the
election, and Albert Kuhfield as clerk,
while August Meyer presided as mod
erator. Needless to state everything
passed off smoothly, and the judges
and clerks attended to their duties in
an efficient manner
Princeton Town Business Meeting.
Considerable interest was manifest
ed in the annual meeting of Princeton
town at the polling place over the
Farmers' Co-operative store Tuesday
afternoon, and about 50 voters were in
attendance. The meeting was called
to order shortly after 1 o'clock, and
August Meyer acted as moderator.
A motion to the effect that every
body act as his own poundmaster was
carried without a dissenting vote.
It was decided not to change the
bulletin boards of the ttiwn, conse
quently they will remain where they
are at present, viz: One at the Long
Siding cross roads, one at the Boyn
road and one on the northeast Ger
many road.
The supervisors' report of the guide
posts was then read, and a motion to
repair the guide posts now in use and
maintain same prevailed.
Clerk Albert Kuhfield then read the
annual financial report of the town,
and same was on motion approved and
accepted.
The financial statement in synop
tic form follows:

The town board recommended that
$550 be voted for township purposes,
and upon motion duly made and car
ried this sum was voted. For road
and bridge purposes the board rec
ommended that $3,000 be voted. A
motion to this effect was made, sec
onded and carried.
The village of Princeton was desig
nated as the place where the next
annual meeting will be held.
A letter urging that the meeting
adopt certain resolutions advocating
that the state highway commission be
stripped of certain powers, from the
so-called Minnesota Home Rule asso
ciation, was read. R. C. Dunn was
VOLUME XL. NO. 13
present, and after he explained that
the bridge combine would be the chief
beneficiary if the proposed changes
were adopted, the letter was tabled by
an almost unanimous vote. The bridge
companies do not relish having their
work carefully scrutinized by ex
perts.
A motion to have a bridge put in to
span the river at the point in Prince
ton town where the Sadley bridge is
now located, was withdrawn, and the
matter was left to the town board.
