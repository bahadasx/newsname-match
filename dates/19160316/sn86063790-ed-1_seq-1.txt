| Gave Him Donkey Orders.
; An Irish, drill sergeant was instructing
some recruits in the mysteries
of marching movements and
found great difficulty in getting a
countryman of his to halt when the
command was given, says the Kansas
1 City Star. After explaining and illustrating
several times he approached
the recruit, sized him up silently
for a couple of minutes, then de1
manded his name.
"Fitzgerald, sor," was the reply.
"Did you ever drive a donkey,
Fitz?"
"Yes, sor."
"What did you say when you wanted
him to stop?"
"Whoa!"
The sergeant turned away and im'
mediately put his squad in motion.
After they had advanced a couple
yards or so he bawled out at the top
of his lungs: "Squad halt! Whoa,
Fitzgerald!"

Aiken, March 10.?Mr. Le Grand
C. Griswold, of New York city, accidentally
shot himself with a doublebarrelled
shotgun, while returning
from a dove hunt on the farm of Mr.
Richardson, six miles from Aiken.
The injured man was rushed to the
city and taken to the home of Dr.
E. S. Cross, where surgical treatment
was resorted to. Upon arrival at the
office of the physician, the condition
of Mr. Griswold was seen to be hopeless,
as the wound V(as in the abdomen.

Is It Legal. _

Francis F. Carroll, a lawyer of
Bamberg, has raised the point that a
the circuit created at the recent ses- g
sion of the legislature is illegal be- n
i* /lonpivo.certain Dersons ^
C<?Utofc} It win utpi ? v t
of -their constitutional rights. Sec- ^
tion 2 of article 6 of the constitution g
of the State provides that either par- j.
ty to a suit in the circuit court shall {
have the right to a change of venue v
whenever it cai* be shown to the
court that a fair and impartial trial t:
rannot be bad in the-county--wfcer*the
trial or action has been com- a
menced or offence has been commit- a
ted. The same section further pro- n
vides that where a change of venue s,
is ordered the trial must be had in a
a county in the same judicial district.
"Now," asks Mr. Carroll, "how can
a change of venue be ordered and the e
trial held in another county within p
the same judicial district if Charles-{ e
ton county is alone in the judicial n
district? The act would deprive a f;
party of substantial constitutional
rights!" a
The News and Courier comments t]
on ftjr. Carroll's card as follows: e
"Mr. Francis F. Carroll, whose n
communication will be found in an- ?(
other column on this -page today, is t]
thp second disinterested lawyer to ex
press the opinion that the recent act
of the legislature providing for a new t
judicial circuit is unconstitutional. j
Mr. E. F. Warren, of Hampton, took
the view that the general assembly f
was without authority under the con- t
stitution to transfer a solicitor from a
one circuit to another, as the act un- a
der discussion did. The law-makers v
ignored his suggestion. It now re- u
mains to be seen if the courts will
be able to ignore the point raised by c
Mr. Carroll. If he is right, his ob- s
jection is certainly one of the utmost 2
gravity. The right under certain ^
conditions to obtain a change of s
venure is fundamental, and Mr: Carroll
maintains that no Charleston liti- v
gant or defendant would be able to a
obtain such a change of venure un- n

Charleston a circuit to itself. If Mr. M
Carroll knows what he is talking e
about, will the courts in any of the a
counties affected by this legislation n
have authority to try cases at all j
during the present year?" 0
It seems that the points raised in ^
connection with -this new circuit g
should be passed on immediately. We t<
are inclined to think that of the two p
points raised the one brought forward
by Mr. Carroll is the more se- fi

]
far is the Chief Cause.?All Manu- 1
facturers of Paper and Other
Material Have Haised Prices.
t
Job printers and stationers are
ery much disturbed over the uncer- ]
ain condition of the market in every- <
hing used in the manufacture of I
rinted work, and of the standard 1
rnes carried by stationery stores. 1
'aper prices have advanced sharply,
nd as a rule rates on printing inks i

rig quotations being withdrawn. A <
rominent ink maker writes -that one <
igredient entering into the manufac- <
ure of black inks has advanced 300 s
er cent. s
Unprecedented Advances. 1
January and February witnessed
ontinuous and unprecedented adances
^in the prices of raw material,! <
nd the failure of sulphite importers'
nd rag packers to make adeq.uate
eliveries on existing contracts forced
writing paper mills making the highr.
grades, to obtain a large portion ;
f raw material on the open market j

lost marked advances that 'the writ- <
rig paper business has experienced in
ears.

hem and utilize them as a base for
uncotton at a cast of two cents to i
hree cents less per pound than the
resent price of raw cotton, and thus
ffer a new outlet for packers of the j
CLLCI giaucs.
The further fact that Great Brit- :
in, on February 1, placed an embar- i
o on the export of all paper makers' i
laterials, and that Sweden placed <
ne on the export of all pulp, has not !
elped in holding down prices. Those

ances made. J

wealthiest negro in this section of
the State, died at his home near
IVestville on March 1. He was quite
aged, having been born a slave.
Kirkland, by thrift and wise business
judgment, had accumulated
luite a fortune. He paid taxes on
four tracts of land, amounting in all
to 3,005 acres, and owned sixty-three
lots and buildings in the town of
Westville, besides personal property
and cash money amounting to around
five thousand dollars. At the time
nf his death he had forty bales of
cotton stored on his farm, and it is
estimated that his estate is worth
around $60,000 to $70,000. He was
a good farmer and was well liked by
both races.
HOW GEN. CAR SUCCEEDED
.'I
Says Newspaper Advertising Was
liasis of His Success
The story of how newspaper advertising
and a trademark built up . |
a fortune of $4,000,000 from an
investment of $12,000 in twenty-five
years was related by General J. S.
Carr, of Durham, X. C., when he arrived
in New York from Honolulu
recently.
Carr was the first manufacturer
of Bull Durham tobacco. He told
how he had spent $100,000 in law
suits to protect his trademark, but
i-sA|
he added advertising had done the
mrkct tn makp the success of the
brand. Mr. Carr said:
"When I signed my first advertising
contract for $250,000 I didn't
sleep for a week. I thought I was
ruined. But the results justified the
expenditure, and soon I was spending
$500,000 a year for advertising.
The biggest part of it went to the < ^
newspapers, for I had learned that
the newspaper ad is the best in the
world. There is no line of business
that it does not help.
; "I was in the banking business,
and I built up as much trade as my
two- nearest competitors combined - ,
by newspaper advertising. My four
boys are the biggest hosiery manufacturers
in the country, and they
have relied on newspaper advertising
to make their success. The first
thing, of course, is to have the goods,
biit after that you must make your
?oods known."
General Carr js one of the few re?
maining generals who surrendered
at Appomattox. He is now lieutenant
general of the veterans of the
Confederacy. He is retired from
business now, having sold out his
tobacco industry in 1898. ^
BURNS PROVE FATAL. I
Frank W. Bean Dies at Home in
Georgia.
Clinton, March 14.?On Sunday
night, March 5, Dr. W. S. Bean, of
this city, was summoned by a telephone
message to leave for Washington,
Ga., where his son, Frank W.
Bean, had been severely, perhaps
fatally, burned. Dr. Bean left at
2:30 a. m. Monday, but reached
Washington about noon, only to find
that his son had died about 6 o'clock
that morning.
The accident occurred Sunday
morning while Frank Bean was
dressing, his night clothing catching
fire. In his excitement he ran down
stairs seeking help, which only made
the flames worse. The physicians
reached him very soon and relieved
the intense pain, and he seemed to

there was no pulse perceptible at his
wrist, and the injury to so much of
the skin caused a nervous shock
t'rom which he never rallied. He
was 40 years of age last December
ind unmarried. He was a graduate
)f the University of Georgia and had
seen admitted to the bar, but never
sracticed. His disposition was very
generous and unselfish, and he was a
consistent Christian and church
nember.
During his last hours he was always
considerate and expressed to
;hose attending him the hope that
le was not troubling them. He fell
isleep without a struggle in the early
ight of the day.
The funeral was held from his
rrandfather's old home, where he
vas born, and the casket was cover
>d with flowers. So sudden a death
:ame as a great shock to his relatives
tnd friends, but his pure life and his
jeaceful departure softened their sorow
for his death.
