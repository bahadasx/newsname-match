SAFE FARMING.
To Farmers and Business Men:
In October I wrote you on
Safe. Farming, and in November
on insurance against loss by pro
ducing the living on the farm.
mi ii t i. i iH. j. , ,
h inis monin i want 10 uuk. iu yuu
( about thrift, and how safe farm-
ing will make us a thrifty and
prosperous people.
In a report written in 1906,
Dr. Seaman A. Knapp gave out
for the Department the follow
ing items of farm economy to be
kept coi.stantly before the far
mers: First. Produce upon the farm
all the food necessary for the
sustenance of the men and ani
mals employed upon the farm.
Second,-Pay all current expen
ses of the farm out of sundry
nroducts other than the cash
crop.
Third, Never mortgage the
cash crop. Let it result in bank
able money at the end of the
season. ' ' '
Fourth, Keep as many domes
tic animals as -will utilize the
waste of the farm and profitably
consume the surplus fodder and
grain.
This 'is the program we cal
safe farming, but I want to cal
special attention to the second
, and third items.
Thrfftv farmers pay current
exDenses for clothing, food
which can not be raised, and
' other incidentals from sundry
products of the farm other than
the cash or money crop. Eggs,
'f chickens, milk, butter, cream,
" 'frufa. ihog or young steer, all
these bring in some income,
The good thrifty farmer makes
such items carry practically all
current expenses and saves the
money crop to pay big debts,
make improvements, to add to
his equipment or stock, or for a
savings account for a rainy day
This is the only way tenant far
mers can become land owners
How can this be done? How
can we avoid mortgaging this
great money crop? How can we
pay the running expenses from
the sundry products of the farm
and keep our great money crop
for cash? The answer is by
following safe, farming. The
prophet said, "Despise not the
day of small things. ' ' Attention
to these little items of income
and saving is thrift, and thrift
gets us out of debt, independ
ent and prosperous.
Don't forget the safe farming
program
1. A home garden for every
family on the farm. Not less
than a tenth ot an acre tor a
garden and half an acre for po
tatoes. An acre of sorghum or
cane for the syrup of the family;
the excess'cane can be fed.
2. Produce corn enough to
feed the people and the livestock
on the farm for a year, with a
little excess for safety.
3. Produce oats and other
small grain to supplement the
corn as food and to conserve the
soil in winter.
4. Produce hay and other for
age crops sufficient to feed the
livestock on the farm for one
-year, not forgetting the legumes
which produce hay and enrich
the soil -
5. Produce the meat for the
family by increased attention to
poultry and hogs. Plan to gen
erally increase and breed up the
cattle and other livestock so as
to consume the otherwise waste
products and make the waste
lands productive. Not less than'
25 hens for a renter and 50 for a
land... owner would help; 100
would be better. Set a standard
of at least one. cow for every
tenant family and two for every
owner, and breed them carefully
and feed them well. Not less
than two milk cows for every
family, the cows properly bred
Bnd fed.
6. When the living has been
provided, grow cotton for the
main money crop. If this is
done there will always be a few
eggs and chickens, a pig now
and then, and occasionally a
steer for sale, and out of these
surplus or sundry products let
us pay the farm expenses.
Safe farming was given a
wonderful endorsement by the
bankers assembled at the Cotton
states bankers Lonierence in
December
They have invited
producers to cooperate witn
bankers to that end that safe
farming may receive proper fi
nancial accommodation at rates
and upon terms as favorable as I
those furnished to commerce
and industry.
The situation has not changed.
There is still' uncertainty. No
one knows what the future of
the cotton market will be.
us therefore, insure the living
by safe farming. If bankers
and business men will cooperate
with farmers to extend credit
upon this plan, we will soon ap
proach that degree of prosperity
to which the Southern' farmer is
justly entitled.
Safe farming, an insured liv
ing and thrift will surely bring
a Happy New Year to many a
family, and the Merry Christ
mas in many a farm home will
be more than the mere spirit of
the season. . ...
Very truly yours,
Bradford Knapp,
Chief.

Missionary Pageant to be Given
at (he Presbyterian Church
The ladies and young people
of the Presbyterian church are
planning a Missionary Pageant
to be given Sunday night,
March 26th.
It is a Home Mission enter
tainment entitled Christ in
America."
All departments of the church
work report the possibility of
deficits at the end of the present
church year (March 31st) unless
the churches take take vigorous
methods at once to raise the
necessary funds. Mite boxes
have been distributed, as far as
possible, among the members,
but whether they have a box or
not every Presbyterian is urged
to be present, on this occasion,
and to make as liberal an offer
ing as possible, that our local
church may not fall behind in
her contribution to the general
work of the Presbyterian church.
If you have not yet given the
tenth of your money due the
Lord, will you not now bring in
your tithe into His store house,
expecting Him to fulfil. His

there shall not be room to
receive it.

Topic for discussion was "In

gent readings to the various hos-
pitals, which are the outcome of
the missionary work, and the
wretched condition of our county
poor house. To put "Home Mis
sion in Action" plans were sug
gested for the betterment of

accordingly committees were ap
pointed by Mrs. Maggie Pannell
to carry out these suggestions.
It shows consideration to speak
of these conditions, but the more
arduous task is to reir.edy them.

E. B. Buckingham. Dead.
Another old soldier has heard
the long roll beat, to fall in line
on the other side of the river,
where the roar of artillery and
the rattle of musketry shall be
heard no more. There to inherit
through eternity the blessings of
peace, that God has reserved for
those who have done their duty
to their God, their neighbers and
their country.
Pro. E. B. Buckingham, after
living a long and useful life, has
moved out into the mysterious
beyond and his familiar voice
shall no more be heard among us.
His was an active life, he was
always on the firing line as a
soldier, and carried the marks
on his own body to show that
where the bullets fell thickest
and the storms cloud raged the
fiercest he was at his post, will
ing to sacrifice even life itself,
for-his convictions of duty.
He was a very positive man,
and spoke his feelings on all
questions without fear or favor.
He was nearly 77 years old
married in 18G1, and had 15 chil
dren, 11 of whom are now living.
Hisv wife and children were very
fond of Him in his old age, as he
was a model man in his family
relations.
It was a touching sight to see
his strong sons and daughters
from several states attend his
funeral and follow him to his
last resting place.
His funeral was preached at
the Baptist Church by Rev. E. E.
Thornton, of Houston, who had
btexr the teacher of his children
and pastor in his family.
Brother O'Briant, pastor of the
Baptist Church at Okolona, (who
had known him" only a few
months), spoke very feelingly o
the good impression Brother
Buckingham had made on him
a3 his pastor for only a short
while.
He was a bright Mason, as ty
ler of the lodge, was always
present. He was buried by the
Masons, as was his request.
