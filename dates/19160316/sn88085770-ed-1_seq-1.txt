DEVOTED TO THE INDUSTRIAL, POLITICAL, AND EDUCATIONAL ADVANCEMENT OF THE WORKING-CLASS
George R. Kirkpatrick's Open Letter
To Guilty College Presidents
Dear Mrs Your CfttalOgl are be
fort me, In these catalog! you at
tractively set forih the advantage*
to be enjoyed by young people who
attend your institutions. Among these
advantages are lome specially liberal
ones which you bold out enticingly
and particularly to those young peo
ple who. you say, are conspicuously
above the average in Intellectual
tiifts. to those graduates of high
schools and those college students
who have indeed already shown that j
nature with unusual generosity has
equipped them for the struggle for
existence. These specially liberal ad-1
vantages are in the form of free j
gifts which you call "fellowships"
and "scholarships" and which yield
the recipients from $100 to $1,000 a
year, for one or more years. This '
sum of money is to be used by those |
who receive it in defraying their ex- i
penses for a year and thus protect j
i themselves against economic want
i and worry which they, GRADUATES
ALREADY, add still more training,
more knowledge, more equipment— j
more armor for the fierce life-strifes j
■of the struggle for existence under \
the present wage-andprofit industrial
system called Capitalism.
You thus propose to help those most ;
| who need help least — those who have
already had much training and who
have also been discovered to be
above the average of those immedi- '
ately around them in the race of life. J

DICE OF LIFE ARE LOADED
GENTLEMEN, under the present
competitive system the dice of life j
. are loaded against both the bright j
and the dull children of the poor, and I
your own actions prove that you your
selves believe this to be the situa
tion. You yourselves arc constantly
whining at the millionaire's back
door for money to establish cash fel
lowships with which, as with life
preservers, you can rescue at least a
few from the bitter storms of com- ;
petitive life. But I must remember i
i that you are cultivated gentlemen
; whom I must address in the gentle
language of polite society. Well,
then, let me use the sweetly metered
smoothness, the rhetorical honey, the
flute-like softness of graceful phrase
appropriate in addressing your aca
demically sensitive and shrinking! y
vulnerable natures, let me with deli
cately diplomatic- Indirectness tell you
this, just this, gentlemen: You seem
ridiculously inconsistent, vulgarly il
logical, mockingly Insincere—and con
temptible. With your learning, your
eloquence ,and your unusual moral
influence you defend the competitive

SEATLE SOCIALISTS
GAIN 300 PER CENT.
The recent municipal election held
In Seal He .showed a gain of 300 per
'■'■ill for the revolutionary Socialists
over that of two years ago. Seattle
was in a very unsettled condition dur

vole is very encouraging as It shows

helpless, and you know they
ARE HELPLESS. These have no op
portunity they lack economic de
fense, while tho.y enrich their minds,
polish their'pearls and prove their
gills. You well know that a mentally
gifted child though keenly willing to
study, may nevertheless grow up to
be a stupidly ignorant man or wom
an. These ignorant children in the
mills and mines, competing against
profit-lusting employers, are strug
gling, gasping for the economic
breath of mere animal existence,
while you admit that even the bril
liant and powerful young men and
women who already have high school
and perhaps several years of college
education need economic protection
while they prepare further for lives
of usefulness and honor and the
many deep pleasures of mental ma
turity. Speak distinctly, pleace: what
is your message for the ignorant
youths whose joyless lives are stuffed
and damned with poverty and toil,
whose hopes tire stillborn, whose
souls shrivel in the fires of competi
tion while YOU MOCK THEM?
More than seventy-five in every
hundred of all the hoys and girls in
the United States never enter even
the first year of the high school or
schools of the high school grade.
Now, place that fact, that big, bald
fact, beside the following important
statement by the most profound and
productive student of human society
that tbe world has yet known, the
late Dr. Lester F. Ward:
"But really, for all except the rarest
cases, something more than a 'com
mon-school education' is required to
insure success. A much broader view
dl' Hie principal branches of learning
is necessary to enable a person of
talent or even a genius to select a
career and pursue it successfully.
The great men of all time have had
Ibis. . ~ . All outside of that group,
whatever may be their native talents,
are excluded from candidacy to
achievement."— (Ward: Applied So
ciology, pp. 229-30.)
And this from President Butler, of
Columbia University:
The British debt, March 1, will be
close to $11,000,000,000. Terrible! Al
most $240 per capita! At this rate
it. will soon reach the gross debt of
New York City, which was nearly
$300 per capita, June 30, if reckoned
from the last general census In the

Kirkpatrick, Everett, March 26, 2 p.m.
"Statistics show that out of 10,000
successful men in the world in all
classes, 8,000 were college graduates.
. . . Kven your self-made man isn't
satisfied unless his son can go to
college."—(Chicago Tribune, March
13, 1905.)
(Probably far more than 8,000 of
the 10,000 were high school or acad
emy graduates.)
Now, what of the astonishing ma
jority, the more than seventy-five per
cent., who do not have opportunity
to discover and develop their tastes,
their powers and their special gifts?
These must make the struggle for ex
istence practically without education,
without, maturing of their powers,
without enrichment of their minds
with knowledge, without tbe Inspira
tions, without the Ideals, without the
grandly expanded life plans to be se
cured chiefly in the finely cultural
stimulating environment of the high
schools and academies and colleges,
and universities. These, my learned
gentlemen, must face the bitter com
petitions, the strangling, suffocating
competitions of life unprepared, un
armed.
No university, silently or openly
agreeing to strangling "understand
ings" for "conditioned" gifts from plu
tocratic filchers of the fruits of toil
—no such university ever helped free
an economic slave class. No such
university ever even tried to do so.
And whenever in such an institution
some brave teachers have raised their
voices in criticism of despotism and
in defense of the hosts that sicken
in ignorance and poverty—such teach
ers have been silenced or promptly
driven from the university or college.
With no thanks to you, guilty pres
idents of universities, we of the work
ing class will hew our own way to
freedom through the mountains of
prejudice and slander you have helped
build in the path of human progress. I
Servile assassins of academic freedom
of discussion, boss strike-breakers of
the professional nobility who strive
for the right to teach without toady
ing, we expect nothing from you ex
cept hollow mouthings and cruel
slanders. We know you.
And, fortunately, we also know
this: In the lower grade schools our
children matched your children and
the children of your masters, too, IN
BRAINS, matched them there till pov
erty kidnapped our boys and girls
and drove them to the mills and
mines and factories of the class who
pay your salaries for your cunning
silence or for your shameless slan
ders. And that fact makes us chal
lenge you to the battle of brains for
the rights of the brain.
"I WILL NOT EQUIVOCATE!"
By William Lloyd Garrison
(The following appeared in the first
issue of "The Liberator," on January
1, 1831, according to Upton Sinclair
in "The Cry for Justice." He adds
that the f ollowing pronouncement
marked the beginning of the anti
slavery campaign):
I am aware that many object to the
severity of my language; but is there
not cause for severity? I will be as
harsh as Truth, and as uncompromis
ing as Justice. On this subject I do
not wish to think, or speak, or write,
with moderation. No! no! Tell a
man whose house is on fire to give a
moderate alarm; tell him to moder
ately rescue his wife from the hands
of the ravisher; tell the mother to
gradually extricate her babe from the
• fire into which it has fallen —but urge
me not to use moderation in a cause
like the present. 1 a mm earnest —I
i will not equivocate—l will not excuse
i —I will not retreat a single inth—and
I will be heard. The apathy uf the
people is enough to make every sta
tue leap from its pedestal and hasten
the resurrection of the dead.
Every dollar that you spend with
merchants who do not patronize our
j paper is a blow to the Socialist cause.

Next Week Is
Lyceum Week
The committee in charge of the Na
tional Lyceum Course, to begin Sun
day, March 26th, has designated next
week, beginning March 20th, as LY
CEUM WEEK. They request that a
special effort be made to sell tickets
and to arouse interest by talking the
matter over with friends and neigh
bors.
Every one who has ever heard the
first speaker, George R. Kirkpatrick,
without a single exception, says that
he is second to none as a speaker.
He is more than brilliant. You will
miss the greatest event in your life
if you do not hear him.
Over 2,500 tickets have been mailed
out to friends and readers of The
Northwest Worker. Use these tick
ets or sell them. There are plenty
more. No day passes that someone
does not ask for more tickets. Let
us fill the Everett. Theatre to the
doors!
Remember that Ryan Walker and
Emil Seidel follow up Comrade Kirk
patrick, and that the course of three
lectures is only fifty cents. Any one
selling $2.50 worth of tickets
will be given one course ticket free.
So get busy NOW. Comrade Salter
has already sold $15 worth.
Don't forget that the Social Science
Club meets on Sunday afternoons at
2:30, 1612 California.

LYCEUM COMMITTEE
PLAN PARADE
Plans are under way for three auto
mobile parades to advertise the open
ing of the Lyceum Course to take
place on Friday and Saturday even
ings, March 24th and 25th, at eight
o'clock, and on Sunday, the day of the
first lecture, before two o'clock. Eight
cars have been so far engaged. It
is hoped that there will be more.
The parade is to form about eight
o'clock between Wetmore and Colby,
on California St. Do you want to be
in it? There will be music and ban
ners. Wilford Dougherty will per
form on the megaphone. Any one
wishing to volunteer the use of a car
for the occasion, call up 478 Z.
All members of the Study Club
are especially requested to be there.
In Chicago, one of the largest of
the 26 recognized charity organiza
tions was called upon to help last
year more than 100.000 families.
