SAN ANTONIO March 15 General
Pershing and practically his entire
command crossed the border at Co
lumbus at noon today. Funston an
nounced late this afternoon. A few I
minor detachments remained behind !
but will follow quickly. The Carranza j
troops joined forces with the Ameri-
can troops and accompanied them, j
How far into Mexico the column
reached tonight is unknown here. Not !
until after Friday are developments
expected. Colonel Dcdd, heading a
smaller column, entered Mexico west
' of Columbus also moving in a souther
ly direction. The two forces will be
in touch before the end of the week.
By that time it is expected the infan
try support will hold the line of com
munication along which the motor
trucks are transporting ammunition
and supplies.
Pershing's report of the entrance
into Mexico dispelled to a great ex
tent, the fears entertained in some
uarters that resistance would be of
fered the troops by the de facto gov
ernment. Colonel Bertani, command
ing the Carranza garrison at Palomas,
joined Pershing with 400 men, and is
reported as showing great eagerness
to join the chase. A number of Mexi
cans are employed as scouts by Persh
ing. Pershing has gone to Mexico with
orders to wipe out the Villa organiza
tion. Unless orders to the contrary
are received from those higher in au
thority than General Funston, 1 the
campaign will continue until Villa is
killed or captured. No limits have

BERLIN, March 15. "Official in

that no German submarine was con

News Agency.
The American consul nt Havre who
reported the Silius was torpedoed
without warning and instructed to pet

EMBARGO ON ARMS.
WASHINGTON. March 15. At the
request of the State department an
order was sent to collector of customs
at Seaports of the United States and
along the Mexican border to hold up
he shipment of arms, ammunition,
and explosives to Mexico, except when
it was clearly established it was for
the use of the de facto government.
The order is said to be the outcome
of information reaching the depart
ment of a large consignment of explo
isves intended for the Villa forres to
be sent south. Officials tonight re
fursed to discuss the subject, but t!i-re i
is reason to believe there is soihe cre
dence to be placed in the recent re
ports that friends of certain European
nations had been willing to put muni
tions of war at the disposal of Villa.

PHOENIX, March 15. The

promised aid. He suggested
the arming of 30 government
employes to be stationed at the
dam. It is reported the Mexi

are former Villa soldiers.

JUAREZ, March 15. General Ga
vira, the Carranza commander here,
said he received instructions ftom
General Obregon, Minister of War, to
order all troops in his district to co
operate in every way with the Ameri
can expeditionary force. Juarez is
quiet on the surface. Americans met
with insults in some parts of the town.
There is evidence of a strong under
current of hostility towards the Unit
ed States.
About 1,000 troops are confined to
the barracks and are forbidden to fre
quent saloons. Nothing stronger than
beer is sold. The statement late to
day of General Gavira said: My sol
diers are absolutely loyal. There is
no danger of any outbreak in this sec
tion. In snile of General Gavira's assur
ican residents were uneasy and most
of them are spending the nights on
the American side. Expressions of
hostility thus far have been confined
to the civilian population. The street
cars are running between Juarez and
El Paso.

FOR ARMY INCREASE.
WASHINGTON. March 15 The
Senate concurred in the House a re
solution providing regular army in
crease to approximately 120,000 fight
ing troops. There was little debate
and the 69 senators in session voted
unanimously for the resolution. Ad

That Warren District business men
stand united in the effort to promote
the interests of the community for
the highest common success was
evinced at all times. That many
similar occasions will be held as a
result of the success of last evening's
splendid program was the opinion ex
pressed by numerous prominent citi
zens who commented on the affair.
Hugh Gunnison, manager of the
Mountain States Tel. Tel. Co., acted
as chairman or the banquet and the
splendid program following. To Gun
nison is due a large measure of credit
for the success of the event. Presi
dent J. C. White of the Warren Ms
trict Business Men's Association also
must come in for much praise. Other
members worked in harmony but to
mention their names would require
enumeration of nearly the entire per
sonnel of the Association.
The banquet was one of the most
elaborate ever put on at a local gath
ering of any kind. The caterer for
the occasion was Chef Henderson, of
the Warren District Country Club.
Following the enjoyment of the
spread and a short formal period,
cigars were passed about and the
time devoted to the enjoyment of the
most delightful informal vaudeville
and musical entertainment ever offer
ed at an assemblage of local business
men.

01 BLOCK SOLO
Theatre Building Will Be Con
structed on Property For-
i merly Uwned Dy rtooen
Hennesey to Seat 1200.
Within the next sixty days, and
probably nearer thirty, the construc
tion of a $15,000 theatre building will
start on the O. K. lot. This became
possible yesterday when the papers
were signed between Robert Hennessy
owner of the property, and the Diamos
Brothers, transfering fifty feet of the
frontage and clear back to the alley
to the latter party. The consideration
is said to have been $25,000.
It is understood that the contract
f sale allows the owner thirty days
in which to vacate. The theatre men
will then start tearing don the old
structure and with that completed will
at once inaugurate the work of con
structing the new edifice.
The purchasers of the property now
own and control a string of Theatres
in Southern Arizona at Nogales. Tuc
son. Douglas and Bisbee. They operate
the Lyric here. Exceeding success has
attended their efforts in this particu
lar litip of business and their purchase
here is considered a most excellent
one.
Though plans have not been com
pleted it is understood the theatre
will accomodate 1200 people. It will
run in the form of a V to the old Re
view Alley, and its frontage will ex
tend from thp present corner of the
Miners Store building to the office oc
cupied by the justice of the peace and
city magistrate.
In view of this action it is reasona
ble to suppose that Mr. Hennessy will
erect on the remaining ground, whicfc
lies between the boundary and O. K.
street, a new building, though nothing
definite along this line has been an-,
nounced.
The improvement, which now ap
pears assured, will mean much o Bis-

ON MEXICAN SOIL
EL PASO. March 15. American
troops are on Mexican soil tonight 60
miles west of here. It is the vanguard
of an expedition gathered in less than
a week, but one of the most powerful
forces assembled in this country since
the Civil War. They were out on the
low gravel hills where a week ago Vil-
la led 1200 bandits stealthily to make
a morning attack on sleeping Colum
bus. Behind he troops who moved,
new regiments rapidly filled the vacat
ed camps at Columbus. The Eleventh
Cavalry was one new arrival. Unoffi
cial reports at El Paso state that 50
miles west of Columbus, near Hachita
another column probably entered Mex
ico. FLOCKS TO COLORS

that event there will be a new aud

CONCERNING VILLA'S FATE.
WASHINGTON. March 15 While
apparently there has been no formal
discussion as to what will be done
with Villa if captured, it is regarded
as probable that, if taken alive, the
bandit leader will be turned over to
the de facto government for prompt
execution. That would avoid ac ci:i
barrasing question which might arise
If the United States undertook to ar
range for his extradition to face trial

will fight as long as there is breath

A long trail of ytliow alkali dust,

noon today, according to Auiericau

border town. Troops over the mes-
quite-covered plains were forming in

division for nimemrnl behind the :n-

The train passengers state that
there was no cheering, no confusion
or excitement. The cavalry troopers

they fought the bandits., swung out
