The results of the bettter baby

that Coconino county is a babies'

three points below. Mothers

from jbreaking those standards
of the! East, here in Coconino.
NeJt year Coconino county

that would be heard across the
continent.

C. H. Hinds has been sinking a
well near his house, but was unable
to complete it on account of the
large flow of water which he struck
at about ten feet. He expects to go
down about ten more feet as soon
as the water will permit. This is
the third well that Mr. Hind 3 has
on his place, and no doubt he has
struck enough water to irrigate a
garden as all the wells are good.
W, F. Thomasson is busy plow
ing at present. He intends to put
in several acres of both oats and
wheat.
Lyle MacLean spent a few days

ASH FORK
Travel has been very good thru
here of late, especially in the tramp
line. As high as ten in one crowd
have camped under the highway
bridge. Also at the garbage plant
north of town, making shelter from
the old iron roofs. " Most of them
were headed for the booming town
of Oatman.
The weather of late has been very
warm for this time of the year. The
grass is coming up fine and the
prospects for a good spring looks
good. Stockmen seem to be pleas-'
ed with the outlook. Cattle and
horses have not suffered from the
snow as one would suppose, but are
looking fine.
Mrs. Parker & Mrs. Briody enter
tained at a very elaborate dinner in
honor of the birthdays of Mrs. Par
ker & Mr. Briody. The table de
corations were hearts and Kewpies.
A large birthday cake with candles
for each year was made for the oc
casion by the Escalente Chef. All
enjoyed a pleasant evening. And
left wishing the parties many more
birthdays.
Wm. Pitts and "family accom
pained by Miss Schofield of England
motered to town last week to pur
chas supplies for the Pitts ranch.
" Billy had the misfortune of hav
ing his fine cement tank go out from
the late floods.
A large pine tree floating down
the creek struck the cement work
breaking it in three places. He
will not lose heart but put in an
other as big.
The Pitts ranch is bound to be
one of the best in this section in
fruit and vegatables. With the aid
of irragation this will be a good
fruit country later on. The feed
out that way is fine and the stock
look fine.
J. D. Brown had a small fire at
his home last Friday night. In a
mistake the lamp was filled with
Gasoline in place of Kerosene and
the result was an explosion. The
kitchen wall was badly schorched,
The volunteer fire dept. responded,
altho very excited at the time they
soon regained their senses and pre
vented what might have been a
great loss to Mr. Brown.
We are in receipt of the announ
cement of the marriage of Mr.
Richard Kennerdelj of Williams
and Miss Emma Hazel of Phila.
The Groom is a man of excellent
reputation and has been in the em
ploy of the Forest Service for some
years as Forest Ranger and has
made many friends here.
Editor Of News
There appeared in last week's
issue of your paper the minutes of
the School Meeting held on Feb
urary 24. I judge from the reading
of the minutes that an attempt was
made to unseat Mrs. Andrew Miller.
The minutes did not show that
she had been formally charged with
being derelict in her duty or that
any charge had been made against
her but they did show that the
other two members of the Board
autocratically and arbitrarily de
clared the office vacant.
I would like to have someone
answer this question. Is it the law
of Arizona that any two members
of a board of three can remeve the
third member without a charge be
ing preferred or a hearing had?
It seems to me that if there is
one thing more than another that
the American people demand, it is
that every citizen have a hearing
before being condemned. I believe
that a public officer can be removed
only for cause and is entitled to no
tice and a hearing in order that he
may have an opportunity to defend.
That to strip an incumbent of his
office without a hearing is a stretch
of arbitrary power and a despotic
denial of justice and a move on the
part of the Board that the people of
Williams will resent.
