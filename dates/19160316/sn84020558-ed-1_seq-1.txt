Republican A. P. Leased Wire
The German crown prince's army ap
jttirently has paused to bring up rein
forcements for a continuance of t lie ad
vance against the Verdun fortress and
its outlying defenses. .Meanwhile the
big guns are exchanging shells at var
ious point along the entire line from
llclgium to the Vosges.
The latest assault by the German in- I
fan try between liethineourt and Cu- j
inieres resulted in the winning of im- I
portant positions, but by counter at- i
tacks the French succeeded in retaking
a portion of the ground, and according
to the official statement of the French '
war office, hold liethineourt, the '
height of Le Mort Homme, and the
Village of Ciiniieres and the southern
boundary of Cumieres wood, all posi
tions of great strategic importance.
To the east of Verdun there has been
considerable activity around Vaux and
lamloup, and fighting at close range
Mill is in progress around the eastern
slopes of Fort Vaux, which for days
past has been the object of some of
the hardest fighting.
The French have taken a German
tieneh south of St. Souplet, which in
dicates that in the Champagne region
the contending forces are still endeav
oirng to take advantage of every op
portunity to strengthen their lines
Advices from Petrograd describe re
markable progress in Persia of the
Kussian troops, who are moving swift
ly over diflicult roads and in the face
of considerable opposition toward the
Mcsopotamian frontier, where shortly
they expect to be in touch with the
I'.ritish forces at Kut-Kl-Amara, and
the relieving column under Generals
Lake and Aylmer. The Russians are
now said to lie within fifty miles of the
last difficult pass which will place
them in the rear of the Turkish Bagdad
army, and their object is to cut the
railway to the north, thereby prevent
ing the Turkish army from receiving
supplies, and cooperate with the Brit
ish against Bagdad.
In their advance against the Turks
along tile Black Sea, toward Trehizond,
the Russians have captured additional
Turkish officers and men and two ma
chine guns. A British column has at
tacked an advanced position of the
Turks in mesopotamia, bayonetted a
considerable number of the Turks and
captured others.
In the Austro-Italian zone the Ital
ians are vigorously shelling Austrian
positions and here and there throwing
their infantry into the fray. No marked
changes in the line have occurred,
however.
The British have captured the port
of Solium in West Egypt from the
Senussi tribesmen led by Turkish of
ficers with only slight resistance. Af
terward they pursued the fleeing
tribesmen and captured officers, men
and guns.
In Fast Africa the Boer general,
Smuts, is actively pressing the Ger
mans, who are reported to be retiring
southwards along the Tangi railway.
An official dispatch from Berlin says
an investigation by the German ad
miralty has disclosed the fact that no
German submarine sank the Norwegian
bark Silius on which there were a
number of Americans, in the Havre
roads.
J uring the illness of General Galli
cni, the French minister of war, his
post will be filled by Rear Admiral Le
case, minister of marine.
Russian Troops Progressing
I'KTKOGRAD, March 15 (via Lon
don). The Russian troops in Persia
are now so far advanced toward the
.Mcsopotamian frontier that they may
be said to be in virtual cooperation with
the British at Kut-Kl-Amara where
General Tow nshend's forces have been
cooped up for several months, and the
campaign against Bagdad has become
two-fold, with the likelihood of the
Russians being as important a factor
in the Mesopotamia operations sis to
their allies.

LOS ANGELES. March 15. Quiet
prepuiations to meet possible trou
ble through outbreaks of nationalistic
sentiment among the thousands of
Mexicans in and around Los Angeles
were made today and tonight by
public service corporations and peace
officers.
A provision in an ordinance lim
iting rpecial policemen to three hun
dred in number, it was learned to
night, was repealed without publicity
by the city council today at the re
quest of Flail e K. Snively, chief of
police. He said perhaps five hundred
would be added to the list of avail
able emergency men. A postcard
canvass of present special officers is
being made to whip the "reserves"

Sixty rifles and riot guns were
gathered in the office of John (.'line,
sheriff, and a thousand rounds of
ammunition set out.
Mexicans accustomed to address
crowds in ihe old "Plaza" were put
under more strict regulation imme
diately after the Columbus raid last
week, and every effort has been
made Chief Snively said, to prevent
any possible demonstration from be

Requests for permissi;n to swear in

made. Chief Snively said, by public

WASHINGTON, March 15. With
American troops across the Mexican
border tonight seeking Villa and his
bandits, President Wilson and officials
of the war department resigned them
selves to wait possibly many days for
news of developments in the chase. In
formation that forces of the de facto
Mexican government were cooperating
with the expedition from the I'nited
States served to relieve anxiety that
had been apparent on all sides over the
possibility of Carranza troops revolting
against their commanders and attempt
ing to oppose the entry of the
Americans.
Although Brig. General Pershing and
Colonel Dodd marched into Mexico
with some 5ioo men about noon today,
it was not until more than six hours
afterward that the official announce
ment came to Washington,

Baker at once hurried to

"The department received to

into Mexico today but does not
give the hour of the crossing. I
am very happy to say that the dis
patch shows that the military rep
resentative of the de facto govern
ment of Mexico not only interposed
no obstacle, but appears to be co
operating." Secretary liaker made it clear that
he had not given out the whole of Gen

Saunders, A. M. Hunt, and Dr. L. H.
Ilaekeland. Dr. Haekeland, who was
appointed to the board on recommen
dation of the American Chemical so
ciety said one of the most important
advantages of a laboratory would be
that of supplying adequate means for
fixation of atmospheric nitrogen for
use in making explosives. The process
es used by German chemists, he said,
were well known in this country, yet
proper steps had not been taken to re
lieve tlie L'nited States of its depend
ence on Chile for its nitrate supply.
Mr. Coffin outlined to the commit
tee a canvass the board is making of
the country's industrial resources and
how they might be mobilized for de
fense. He said a report probably would
be ready by May. Mr. Saunders urged
that the advisory board be legalized.
and Mr. Hunt, the civil engineer, read
I a statement emphasizing the advan
I tages of a laboratory from an engineer
I ing standpoint.
I The scientists declared that an ex
perimental plant financed by the gov
ernment and backed by the best sci
entific skill of the country would be
valuable not alone as a preparedness
measure, but would make possible
many steps forward in industrial de
velopment. One suggested that great
things might be accomplished in per
fecting the aeroplane, and another said
' that a proper application of science to
' shipping might revolutionize the mer-
' chant marine.
It was urged that the proposed lab
oratory be under administration of the
I navy department, though it might con
cern itself with many things aside from

JAt'KEZ. March 1." General Gavin
Carranza commander here, said to
night that he had received insirui
tions from General obregon. Car
ranza's minister of war, to order all
troops in his disrict t' co-operate in
every way with the American expedi
tionary force. Jaurez is quiet on tlin
surface but Americans met with in
sults in some parts of the town and
there was evidence of a strong under
current of hostility towards the I'nit
ejl States.
There are about l.oiio troops in
this town and nearly ail were con
fined to barracks today. They have
been forbidden by General Gavira
to frequent saloons. Nothing stronger
than beer is permitted to be sold in
the town.
In a statement issued late today
General Gavira said:
"My soldiers are absolutely loyal
and there is no danger of any out
breaks in this section. I have re
ceive reports that Colonel Riojas
has been murdered by the troops
at Ojinaga and I am trying to
get in comunication with that town
but so far have failed. There is no
reason whatever for any hostility to
ward Americans on the part of loyal
Mexicans and 1 have assurances that
all troops in my district will get in
full concord with the Americans who
are pursuing Villa. I am in complete
control of the situation here."
General Gutierrez left here today
for Chihuahua to take command of
one of five columns of 1,200 men
each who are declared by General !
Gavira to he closing in on Villa in j
the Casa Grandes region. General
Bertani, who has been in command I
of the garrison at i'alomas. has gone j
to Cuzman, according to Gen. Gavira
and will direct the operations of another
of the five columns from that point.
In spite of General Gavira's assur
ances there was plainly visible here
today
feeling of uneasiness among
the American residents. The most
of those who are in business here tire
spending the nights on the American
side. Kxpressions of hostility by
Mexicans have thus far been confined

SAN ANTONIO, Texas, March '
15. General John J. Pershing,
with more than four thousand
troops, began the pursuit into
Mexico today of Francisco Villa.
General Pershing's report that he
and his command had crossed the
international boundary line just
south of Columbus, reached Gen
eral Frederick Funston late to
day. Reports of progress in the
country where the search has
been begun will be made by
General Perching to General
Funston, but it is not expected
these will be frequent or deal
with any but the more important
developments.
How far into Mexico the col
umn had reached tonight was un
known here. Not until after Fri
day are sharp developments ex
pected. Colonel George A. Dodd, head
ing a smaller column that en
tered Mexico sonvs distance west
of Columbus, also is moving in a
southerly direction, and these two
forces should be within touch of
each other before the end of the
week. By that time it is ex
pected an infantry support will
hold the line of communication
along which motor trucks for the
transportation of ammunition and
supplies will be operated.
Although the censorship imposed
by General Funston was relaxed to
night, efforts still were made to keep
secret the details of the plan of the
campaign.
General Pershing's report of his en
trance lr.to Mexico served to dispel
to a great extent fears that had been
entertained in some quarters that
resistance would be offered by the
tro ips of the de facto government.
Colonel Bertani, the commanding of
ficer of the Carranza garrison at Pa
lomas, on the south side of the line,
joined General Pershing. His force
was only some 400 ment. hut they
were reported to have displayed will
ingness and even eagerness to Join
in the chase.
As a body, the Mexican troops will
remain under their own commander,
hut a number of ihem are being em
ployed as scouts by General Pershing.
C-eneral Pershing has gone into
Mexico with orders to wipe out Villa
and his organization. Unless orders
to the- contrary are received from
those higher in authority than Gen
eral Funston, the campaign that was
begun today will continue until Villa
Is captured or killed. No limits have

TO TURN VILLA OVER

i While apparently there has been

j be done with Francisco Villa if !
' he is captured, it is regarded as '
! probable that if taken alive, the

States undertook to arrange for .

I officers think, however, it is al-
together unlikely that Villa will

were that the vessel will leave promptly

A high naval officer tonight admit
ted the destroyer is being sent to the
Lower California town to investigate
hut he would not say if further re

The garrison at Knsenada so far as
is known, has never pledged loyalty to
