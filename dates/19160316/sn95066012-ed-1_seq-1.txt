Less Rigid,
Ban Antonio, Tex., March 16. Brig
Gen John J. Pershing, with more than
4000 troops, began the pursuit in Mexi
co yesterday of Francisco Villa, whose
raid across the border last week
Caused' President Wilson and his cabi
net to' decide to use the United States
army to run him down. Gen Persu
ings report that he and his command
had crossed the international bound
ary, line Just south of Columbus
reached Gen Frederick Funstou here
late yesterday.
His report served to dispel to a
great extent fears that had been enter
tained In some quarters that resis
tance would be ottered by the troops
of the de facto government. Col Per
tani, the commanding oolcer of the
Carranza garrison at Palouia3, on the
south side of the dividing line, prompt
ly Joined Gen Pershing. His force was
only somo 400 men, but they were re
ported to have displayed willingness,
and even eagerness, to join in the
chaBe. As a body the Mexican troops
will remain under their own command
er, but a number of them are being em
ployed as scouts by Gen. Pershing.
, Reports of . progress in the country
where the search bas begun will be
made by Gen Pershing to Gen. Fun
: eton, but it is not anticipated that
! these ; will be frequent ob deal with
any but the more important develop
ments. How; far into Mexico the
column has reached was, unknown
' last night, nor did , Gen., Funston up-
pear greatly concerned. Gen. Persh-'
lug's course for . the next two days is
known at headquarters, and not until
after tomorrow are sharp develop
ments expected.
Col. Gcorga A. .Dodd,' heading a
smaller column that entered Mexico
some distance west of Columbus, also
is moving in a southerly direction,
and these two forces should be within
touch of each other before the end of
the week. By that time it is expect
ed an Infantry support will hold the
lines of communication along which
motor trucks for the transportation of
ammunition and supplies will be oper
ated. Although the censorship im
posed by Gen Funston was relaxed
last night, efforts still were made to
keep secret the details of the plan of
campaign, the exact number of men
engaged and their actual locations.

OSBORNE NOT GUILTY
Former Sing Sing Warden Acquitted
of Perjury Charge.
White Plains. N. Y., , March 15.
Thomas Mott Osborne, prison refor
mer. Harvard gruduate, twice may
or of Auburn, N. Y., and former war
den of Sing Sing, was acquitted of the
charge of perjury by direction of Jus
tice Arthur F. Tompkins to a jury in
the Westchester county supreme court
hero today.
Justico Tompkins in a long opinion
held that Dr. Rudolph Diedling, a
state prison commissioner, was with
out authority under the state prisor
law when he investigated, single
handed, Osborne's administration of
Singling. It was before Dr. Died
ling that Osborne, last October, com
mltted the alleged perjury, by swear
lng, as charged, that he was with
out knowledge of certain cases ot
immorality.
Justice Tompkins held in his opin
ion that there was no lawful perjurj
committed by Osborne, inasmuch as
the warden had the right to keep in
violate the pledges which he had giv
en to the guilty convicts who had con
fessed to him their immorality. -
PLAN BOOM FOR HUGHES '
,r
Organized Efforts in Nebraska Led by
Victor Rose-water ,,
A vigorous campaign is to be con
ducted in Nebraska to give Justice
Charles' E. Hughes of the Supreme
Coict the presidential preference vote
of Nebraska republicans. Justice
Hughes has refused to allow his name
to go on the ballot. Victor Rosewater,
former national committeeman and as
sociated republicans, will start their
work immediately after the filings
have closed in about two weeks. Mr.
Rorewater, Who is the owner of the
Omaha Bee, has enlisted Nebraska re
publican newspapers in his plan,
which urges the writing of Hughes'
name on the ballot In the' space left
blank. . .-. i . v
vThus far seventy-four -republican
newspapers are enlisted in the move
ment, and as many more have express
ed themselves as more than lukewarm
for Justice Hughes. Mr. Rosewater
and his friends believe that two weeks
will Le sufficient time to swing the re
maining newspapers into line. The
Nebraska State Journal at Lincoln and
the Hastings Tribune are among the
newspapers which Indorse Hughes.
The Nebraska plan, it is asserted, is
merely part of a general plan which is
to be followed througnout tne nation
iMt is successful here. The Hughes
sentiment, it.is said, will, after the
initial move here, cause a "popular up
rising" throughout the country.

MACHINES HUM IN EVERY MILL
Prospects That More Operatives Wil
Be Able to Find Employment in
Local Factories
i Desirable tenements are at a prem
ium in Bennington at the present
lime. For several months there has
M&en a growing activity in the factor
NtVand mills and as a result the com-
mtriitjt just now is expanding Indus
triftusljimore rapidly than it is resi
dential There ' was considerable
ouinyug owing the past season ana
thereVaie evidences that a number of
houses wiirW'put up during 191C but
unless'lh'ero are radical changes in
the business situation, of which there
is little prospect at present, the .de
mand lor tenements is bound to con
tinue. At the present time nearly every
plant, particularly those employing
women operatives, is working at full
capacity. Not much difficulty has
been experienced by the superinten
dents in keeping their machines hum
ming every day as there aro a large
number of women and girls who huve
had experience in some one of the
lines of work and who can bo called
upon during a rush period such is pro
vailing Just now. At the samo time
there : are prospects ahead which
should provldo employment for more
women operatives than are at present
available.
i. 'Tho KZ Waist company, which
moved to this village after its factory
at North: Bennington was burnodhas
for a long time found its present quart
ers on Gage street inadequate for its
business. Recently the, company
moved a portion of its equipment to
the buildings formerly used by the
Tiffany undSrwear company, but ever.
with this addition it finds itself unable
to keep up with its orders and ,hai
oeen compelled to open a'branch lac
tory at Cambridge for the purpose of
flnlehlng a portion of the garments
being turned out at the Gage strdet
plant. Recently a number of girls
-Tom Cambridge have been at work tit
the company's factory 'here learning
to operate finishing machines. The
.vill return to Cambridge Saturday
night to be on hand as the branch fac
tory is expected to bo opened for
business next .Monday. The -. branch
ai ill is being Installed in the building
at Cambridge last occupied by the Su
perior company in the manufacture of
sweaters. The E Z company expects
to eventually employ about CO hands
at Cambridge. The shipping or gar
ments to Cambridge to be finished oi
course adds to the cost of production
The company has definitely decided
upon the enlargement of its Cage
street building. The contract has not
been let but the plans and specifica
tions have been drawn and made and
the company is in the market for ma
terial. The present building will be
raised another story nnd a large nddi
tion will be built on the Fouth end of
the structure. The additional floor
space will enable the company to con
centrate its business and to a large
extent eliminate the expense of oper
ating three separate plants. '
The Bennington Hosiery company is
operating its plant to its full capacity
and the officials stato that the output
is sold for months ahead. Only a few
days ago a buyer from Paris called at
the company's office ready to place a
large order had the company been in
a position to fill it.
At the Bottum &. Torrance factory
business is better thau it has ever
been in the history of the company.
Nearly two hundred hands are employ
ed and the finished stock, particularly
sheets and pillow cares, is being
turned out in large quantities. A car
load of cotton cloth lasts but four
days.
It Is understood that tho underwear
factories are ail exceptionally busy
and in some of them the orders are ac
cumulating at a rate that taxes the
capacities ot the equipment.
Such prospects would indicate that
there are opportunites here for the
employment of a larger number of
women operatives than are at present
working in the different factories.
Should business continue to increase,
and reasons can be advanced -why
there should be an even greater de
mand for the products ot the local in
dustries, it would seem as though more
operatives would be needed.
Bennington is one of the best resi
dential towns in the country. Its lo
cation is surpassed by few. It has oil
the advantages of a town of its size,
excellent schools, a good library, op
portunitles for amusement and excel
lent railroad connections. There is no
better town to live in anywhere in
New England. Should future business
create a demand for more operatfVes
than can be supplied from thtf present
population there is no reason why
young women living in other commun!
ties should hesitate to move to Ben
nington. As was stated In the begin
ning of this article, .Bennington at
present is not so well supplied with
good tenements as might be, but this
is a condition that always remedies
itself although some inconvenience
may be experienced while the demand
is in excess of the supply.

Citizen Soldiers Can Mobilize Within
24 Hours, Says Reeves.,
"The first regiment, Vermont Nat
ional Guard can mobilize ready for
service on the Me.duin border if need
ed, within 21 hours" said Ira' LI Reeves
of Northflcld, Colonel of the Regiment
while in Burlington Monday.
"Tho Vermont militia is in as good
shape today for actual service as any
National Guard organization ' in 'the
country," continued Col. P.eeves.
"Each company's equipment, which is
adequate, is for the most part with
them and it would take but a short
time to get ready."
If Vermont's Grand is called upon
at all, it will probably be to take the
place of the regulars on the Mexican
border while the latter aro hunting
Villa.
Besides the first regiment, which to
day is pretty well recruited, Vermont
could send n well organized and equip
ped hospital corps and a squadron of
cavalry.

GERMAN PEACE TERMS
I
Report Said to Be Brought Home
by
( Cel., House.
Washington, March 14. President
Wilson, it is understood on good au
thority, has in hand, without any
definite lise to make of them, the
peace teVms that are likely to be
heard Xfoin Berlin.
Colonel House shortly after his re
turn from Germany, it is said, laid be
,forethe president Germany's tentative
proposals as modified-' by recent
months ot warfare. Colonel House did
not go. to Berlin to discuss possible
peace terms, but it is said he did re
ceive an outliue of the German view
of a proper settlement following the
end of the war. ., ',
, Tho terms Germany would consider,
confirmed 'by high Gorman authority
here, piovide: :
(Tuo Geiman colonies, taken by the
entente allies, be returnod to Germany
'.That no indemnities be dornanded by
either aide. !
That Montenegro, Serbia and Alban
ia le divided among Austria, Bulgaria
ami Greece.
That an autonomous government' be
established in Poland.
That Turkey be entirely freed of
British influences.
That Germany return Belgium and
those poitions of French territory now
in possession of the Kaiser's troop3.
That Russia assume possession of
Persia..., ,
That England remain as she now is,
neither giving nor receiving anything.
It is understood that Colonel House
reported to the president that the en
tente allies were unwilling at- the
present time to consider peace. This
belief is expressed also by, high Ger
man officials. But-oue of the things
that is understood to have made the
allies firm in determination to con
tinue the struggle was the, belief that
Germany would keep Belgium and
would demand indemnities. But Ger
many will demand neither if peace can
bo brought about at the present time.
Regarding tills a high German offi
cial said that both sides "ought to
pretty thoroughly understand by now
that there could be no demands for
idemnitics." And as for Germany re
taining Belgium, he added, "there is
no longer any thought of it by the
German government."
Regarding other terms of peace it is
the belief of the German government,
according to reports said to have been
made to President Wilson, that the on
ly way to establish order in the Balk
ans is to distribute the land inhabited
by the Albanians, Montenegrins and
Serbians among Austria, Bulgaria and
Greece. That Greeco would receive a
share of the conquered territory is re
garded as significant in its possible
bearing upon that country's refusal to
enter the war on the side of the allies.
