WE ARE A RERBEX OF TEE
Hard Luck:
Anybody can get along and smile and prosper when
everything is going right; while you are getting a good
salary; while crops are good and the season propitious.
But when adversity comes in its myriad forms, strikes,
crop failures and calamities, you will need, to say the
least, a bracer. Then is the time you will need a little
money in the bank. Then is when the prudent man who
has been establishing a substantial connection with a good
bank will appreciate the advantages thereby derived. He
will have something to lean on. Truly a '-help in time of
trouble."
