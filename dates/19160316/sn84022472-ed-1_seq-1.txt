simultaneously a torpedo was seen ap
proaching the vessel. ... It came so close
that the revolving' screw could plainly
be noted and. swept by 20 roet astern.
Passengers on ; deck who , saw the
torpedo created a turmoil which at
, tr'acted the steerage passengers to the
rails and the excitement subsided only
after; the periscope disappeared -and
the : ship sped away without being
again subjected to attack. . . ;.
, The Patria. after landing at other
ports, carried nearly . aOOO passengers
when she arrived here today. ..

by both his lawyers, Judge Robert E. DeForest and Attorney

His face was flushed, but he stepped into the yourt room
with a firm tread. ' f .
After the usual preliminaries, the judge asked Foreman
Wakeless of the jury if an agreement had been reached.
Foreman Wakeless replied inthe affirmative.
"Guilty or not guilty?" asked Judge Webb.
"Guilty," declared Foreman Wakelee. '
The jury found for murder in-the second degree.

dressed the prisoner and asked him if
he knew any reason why sentence
should not be pronounced. 1
No, sir," said- Haines calmly arid
distinctly. He listened intently. -
Judge Webb then explained to the
prisoner that he had been found guil
ty of murder in the second , degree I by
a jury of his peers; that he baa had
eminent counsel and eyery effort has
been made to establish any facts that
might have led to the lessening of the
degree of the crime.
He then sentenced Haines to life
imprisonment in Wethersfield. He
dismissed the jury after thanking
them for their service to the state.
and they scattered to their homes.
Haines was immediately removed
from the court room and preparations
were begun to take him to Wethers

Boston, March 16. A motion for the
expulsion of Representative Harry C.
Foster, of Gloucester, who had been
under investigation charged with con
duct ' unbecoming a member in con
nection with pending legislation, was
made here today. Action was deferred
until tomorrow.
Found Guilty of Murder
for anywhere near such a period.
The. longest time recalled by any
Court attendants here is that of the
jury in the case of the State vs. Le-roy-
Butler, who was tried three times
for the murder of his mother in Stam
ford. In the last trial here March 2,
1906, the jury was out for nine hours,
acquitting.
Analogy ff the Haines case was
fourijd today in that of Edward Sohier
man of Dan-bury, tried in that city
for the murder of' u, wife. November
12, 1908. (In. this case cots had been
provided fbr the. jury fn the court
room but they returned a verdict at
4 o'clock in the morning, before they
had retired for the night.
In many instances the Schierman
case presents similarity, to that of Ja
son Haines. He had shot his wife
down in the streets of Danbury, using
a revolver for the purpose. After
arrest he was defended -by Judge Carl
Foster of Bridgeport, who set up a
similar defense of insanity due to al
coholic and drug addiction. Allien
ists Dieffendorf and John C. Lynch,
who appeared in the present trial,
were the insanity experts. The ver
dict was second degree murder reduc
ed from the charge of. first. Schier
man was a laborer. )
The. Haines jury retired shortly af
ter 11 o'clock last night. They were
accommodated with six cots in the
main criminal superior court room,
three cot in the jury room and three
cots in the attorney s room. These
rooms are all connected and the doors
remained'O-pen within. All the outer
doors were locked and guard3 placed
at i the entrances. Deputy Sheriffs
Frank Olmstead, James Kiernan and
Frank Fasanella maintained the nec
essary watch.

a troop of young sea lions march
into the house and at meal time
the- entire colony surrounds his
domicile barking for . admittance.
Sleep is difficult, he says, for the

Gen. Pershing's Force of 5,000 Men Meet With Co
operation In Plans For Pursuit of Villa's
Bandits, Says Report to Arihy Headquarters
First Night in Camp -Uneventful, Says Gen.
F unston Guards at Bridge Near Brownsville!
Are Fired Upon By Outlaws.
Columbus, N. M., March 16 Via mail to El Paso The
American expedition which entered Mexico yesterday spent
an uneventful nighty camped but a short distance from the
American line. ' J
Brig.-Gen. John J. Pershing, commander of the expedi
tion, accompanied the force as far as the border and then re
turned and with another part of the troops entered Mexico on
the flank of the main army.
Despite rigorous censorship, which closed all telephone
and telegraph wires to military movements, it became known
that the number which entered Mexico is about 5,000. Aero
planes are believed to have passed in with-the expedition on
motor trucks. Flying conditions, owing to the clearness of
the atmosphere, arte ideal.
When General Pershing gave the
order to march at 10 o'clock yester-
day morning, the soldiers swept for
ward with a shout. Cowboys off the
ranges enrolled as scouts and cavalry
led the way. The infantry regiments;
some field artillery and a wagon train
followed.
The departure was as business-like
as a practice march. A long, hazy
line of alkali dust, standing out
against the dull white of the plains,
and the blazing sun, marked the pro
gress of the troops.
General Slocum met General Da-
villa, . of the Carranza forces, who
promised that no resistance would be
made to crossing the border. The en
tire Mexican population in Palomas,
soT liars and civilians, withone excep
tion,, cleared a way when -the Ameri
cans marched through the town. The
censor has asked , all correspondents
filing- by mail not to disclose military
movements or details as to numbers
of troops, saying that to make public
questions of such military importance
might mean a -loss of American lives.
This applied only to mail matter as
not even the general facts of the
crossing have been allowed to go over
the telegraph wires, which are under
military control. J
The column leaving Columbus was
thoroughly equipped for all conditions
that might arise and represented all
arms of the service. ' : I
Carranza Is Co-operating.
Washington, March 16 President
Wilson was informed by - Secretary
Baker early today that both columns
of American troops now ii Mexico in
pursuit or villa and his bandits were
meeting with hearty co-operation
from the Carranza soldiers.
MOKMOS CO IX) NY SAFE
El Paso, March 16. Villa, since the
pursuit of- the. American army started,
apparently has passed beyond the
American Mormon colony at Casas
Grandes. Reliable despatches today
indicated that the 500 Americans there
are safe, These despatches -gave credit
to Carranza forces about1 Casas
Grandes for putting: up a front which
stopped Villa from making his propos
ed raid on the Americans.
Today's information strongly in
dicated that the bandit leader, with
his supply of swift norses, is again on
the move. Information concerning
his movements was closely guarded.
Casas Grandes is about 100 miles
due south of the point where the col
umn of General Pershing entered Mex
ico yesterday.
"ALL WELL," SAYS
FIRST REPORT OF
PERSHING'S ARMY
San An,tdnio, Tex., March 16 The
first report from Brigadier-General
Pershing, commanding the expedition
ary forces into Mexico, to Major-Gen-eral
Funston, stating that all was go
ing well was received at Fort Sam
Houston early today. The report dealt
with the disposition of the various
units, the distance of the first day's
march and the movement of the Car
ranza troops. All these questions
come under the censorship, however,
and were not given out.
Brigadier-General Pershing's aus
picious start into Mexico without op
position from Mexican forces and ap
parently without serious disturbances
along the border was the topic of con
versation today at" Fort Sam Houston,
headquarters of Major-General Funs
ton. Ever since he began planning ex
peditionary movements to punish
Francisco Villa, General Funston has
paid close attention to the attitude of
General Carranza and his followers.
When General Pershing wired yester
day that ie had crossed theb order
and had been joined by the Carranza
force stationed at Palomas, the major
general evinced great satisfaction.
This was heightened early today when
reports indicated a slight disturbance
near Kingsville, Tex., when a small
detachment of troops guarding the
Barredo bridge on the St. Louis,
Brownsville & Mexico Railway was
fired on about midnight. Not more
than five shots were fired, none taking
effect. For fear that another attack
migrht follow, reinforcements- were
sent from San Benito in automobiles
. I
to help guard the bridge.
Keen interest was taken in the suc
cessful working of the censorship im
posed by General Funston after it
Vias, decided to catch and punish Villa, i
General Funston . today voiced hia!
satisfaction that after the public fully '
understood the situation there had j
been no expressions over the failure i
of the expedition to make an eaTlier!
start. It was generally felt in army ,
circles that in consuming only a week
in preparing for the search for Villa
and at the same time protect the bor-
der, . the southern department had
done fast work. There was a short
age of rolling stock in rrfany sections;
there was no large force available at
any particular point; supplies had to
be transported and mounts for the
cavalry iad to bp. added.

large nunrBers either for the United j
States or the larger coast ports where j
better protection was " provided by

AMERICAN TROOPS
NEAR BROWNSVILLE ,
ATTACKED IN NIGHT I
Brownsville, Tex., March 16 At
Fort Brown today it was reported that
American soldiers guarding the rail
road bridge, 14 miles east of Browns
ville were fired upon about 1130 last
night from the Mexican side. Four
or five shots were fired. The troops
did not return the fire. No one was
injured. A small detachment of
troopers was sent from San Benito In
automobiles to reinforce the guard at
the bridge.
