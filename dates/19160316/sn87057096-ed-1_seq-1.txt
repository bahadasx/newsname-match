AT THE BIG TABERNACLE
The Fairfield Bisinessmen's Gospel
Team is Attracting Big Crowds.
Great Interest is Aroused.
Leon's first tabernacle meeting,
Which (or the past week has been
the talk of the town, opened in full
blast Sunday morning at the big tab
ernacle on Church street, under the
leadership of the Business Men's
Gospel Team of Fairfield, Iowa. The
popular Leon band was used to as
semMe the dofrn-town people and to
announce the meetings. After the
band had played several special
numbers, the leader of the Fairfield
team, Mr. A. K. Harper, in a few
choice words, announced the taber
nacle meetings and Invited the peo
ple to the services. The crowd then
nHirched with the band to the taber
nacle. The churches suspended their
regular services and at the close of
the Sunday school hour, the differ
ent schools proceeded to the taber
nacle.
The big tabernacle which seats
2,000 people was more than two
thirds filled by 11 o'clock when the
services began with the K. of P. band
playing a special selection. This

first rehearsal Saturday evening at
the tabernacle. At the close of the.
song service and after the taking of
the offering, the leader, Mr. Harper,
without waiting for an introduction
and with lightning like rapidity read
his text and announced his subject,
"Fire." And from that moment the
fire-works began. With rapid fire
action he hurled broad sides at the
enemy of righteousness and proclaim
ed the refining power of God. The
speaker's winning personality, in
tense zeal and earnestness and logic
claims for him the closest attention.
The sermon was only twenty minutes
in length but was well received and
proved to be a splendid appetizer, for
fully as large an audience was there
in the afternoon to hear his sermon,
on "Pa, Ma and a Little Fun." In
the evening, even the far-sighted
builders of the tabernacle as Avell as
all Leon were surprised that the big

tabernacle was filled and some were
left standing and many turned away
the first night of the campaign. It
certainly indicates something of the
impression the visiting team has
made upon our people and Leon's
wish and purpose for a genuine re
vival. Mrs. B. W. Lanning, of New
Hampton, Mo., formerly of Leon, was
teecured by the local committee as pi
anist.
The Fairfield team, individually
and collectively appears to be a
miglity force working for righteous
ness, but the big little man of the
organization, the veritable dynamo, is
the intrepid leader, Mr. A. K. Harper
owner of the Harper Brush Works of
Fairfield. He is the general of the
•whole campaign, the power- behind
the movement and with his careful
planning and shrewd generalship the
success of the work seems assured.
One has only to meet this man to be
impressed with his wonderful, earn
estness and burning desire, to. rescue
men from the paths of sin.. As you
more when you have recognized hii
big-heartedness and his great
•s 1.
be the leader of this notable band of
business men. He inspires them and
also his audience with bis purpose
and enthusiasm. One is struck with
his ability to adapt himself to condi
tions. He addresses a mass meeting
or a gathering of business men or a
High School crowd with apparently
the same ease. Harper believes in
good wholesome fun and does not
hesitate to use a humorous illustra
tion or to tell a good story which at
times convulses his hearers but in it
all it is plain to be seen that he is
seeking to lead them into the deeper
and nobler things of life.
Then, too, if you have visited his
brush-works and have observed the
perfect system and the good judg
ment used in the selection of his men
you are impressed that he knows
how to handle big men and big busi
ness all of which has trained him for
what he regards as the biggest busi
ness of all, the business of his King.
While Mr. Harper is the recognized
leader of the team, he is not the
president. That honor belong to Mr.
C. W. Wade, the largest mercantile
man of Fairfield. Other prominent
men of the team are Frank Daggett,
once a victim of strong drink and
now president of one of the largest
Bible classes in the state also
"Uncle John," another wealthy man
of Fairfield. "Uncle John" says
ey on two cigars or tobacco a day
10c, a couple of drinks loc, and
"I gave $10,000 to a college and have
vit
pttid all right.'Oidli
it.
Before coming to Leon this team
had just closed a great meeting at
Washington, Iowa. They were handi
capped for want of a tabernacle, but
filled to overflowing two of the larg
est churches, one seating fourteen
hundred and the other a thousand.
They had over four hundred conver
sions and organized a Gospel Team
of more than six hundred men.
We do not know whether or not
Leon sent out a wireless S. O. S. and
the message was picked up by the
"life-saving crew" over in the classic
city of Fairfield anyway the Mace
donian cry. was answered and the
Fairfield Team have literahy taken
our town by storm and everybody,
voluntarily is capitulating to them.
Certainly a marvelous change has
taken place in Leon in the past few
days and now everybody is thinking
and talking in praise of the taber
nacle meetings. The Leon people
have stood with open-eyed wonder
and amazement at the phenomenal
growth of the big tabernacle. Thirty
five thousand feet of lumber was
used in its construction, the volun
tary labor averaged from fifteen to
twenty men a day and several teams
and wagons. The tabernacle is heat
de by stoves and all serves the con
venience and comfort of the people.
Never before has Leon witnessed
such a demonstration in church ac
tivity. Men of all classes, business
men, merchants, bankers, lawyers,
doctors, together with the preachers
have responded enthusiastically to
the erecting of the structure and also
in the services.
Cottage prayer meetings are being
held in different parts of the city ev
ery morning at 10 o'clock. Mr. Har
per has a twelve minute meeting
with the business men at banks and
other business places. Certain ev
enings are designated for special
meetings. Tuesday evening was High
School evening and a two dollar prize
was awarded to thq class with the
largest attendance.
Other members of the Fairfield
team will be present at different
times during the meetings as will also
special men and teams from other
towns and cities. Rev. Davis and
several members of the Corydon Gos
pel team were in the services Monday
evening. The lodges and clubs of
the city are closing their meetings
early and then going in a body to the
tabernacle. The business men are
closing up their stores during the
hour of the meetings. It is expect
ed that all the business places will ar
range to close by the second week of
the meetings. People think it re
markable that a tabernacle with
a seating capacity of fifteen thousand
in a city of more than a hundred
thousand population was built in a
city like Des Moines, but what about
a city of 2200 with a tabernacle seat
ing 2000 and people crowded out?
Are not our Leon people beginning to
appreciate the value of Mr. Harper's
assertion, "That the best business^ as
set any community has, is an honest,
industrious, temperate citizenship!"

Facts Concerning Cemetery Exten
sion.
The question of procuring addition
al cemetery grounds has been before
the city councils for a number of
years and in consequence of a division
of opinion as to which direction
would be best to make the extension,
final actiort had been delayed until
about a month ago. when it became
imperative that more land should be
acquired immediately for burial pur
poses. The opposition having dimin
ished to one member, councilman J.
M. Gardner, and he finally gave in,
the city council unanimously voted to
extend it westward, and the mayor
was instructed to appoint a commit
tee of two to wait upon Mr. Cummins,
the owner of the. west land and get
his price for 10 acres adjoining the
present cemetery. He refused to con
sider any amount less than $350 an
acre, or $3500 for the 10 acres.
The committee made their report
to the city council to this effect,
whereon the council believing this to
be an unreasonable price, instituted
condemnation proceeding according to
law and a sheriff's jury composed of
six representative citizens versed in
land prices, fixed the price at $210
per acre or $2100 for the above stat
ed 10 acres.
No member of the city council has
had anything to do in fixing this
price and any statement to the con
trary is wrong and misleading.

CHAKLRY AKES WAS OUTCLASS
ED.
Tried to Buy a Hereford Bull at Har
ris, Mo., Sale, but Dropped Out
Wheen They Sold For 9*4,100
and 97,000.
When Charley Akes makes up hs
mind he Wants something he seldom
lets the price stop him, but recently
when he went to Harris, Mo., with
the intention of buying a Hereford
bull for his stock farm, he went up
against the real- thing. He stayed in
the game with a bid of $1,475, but
the pace was entirely too swift for
him and he dropped out and came
home without a bull. The sale
broke all records for the United
States. The following report of the
sale is taken from the Harris Herald
Wednesday, March 1st, 1916, the
town of Harris, Sullivan county, Mo.,
was again placed upon the world's
map in red capital letters when O.
Harris & Sons' 61 head of .blood
champion Herefords had been sold at
prices that, sale average price and
grand total, turned another page in
history's record for high selling.
There were more than 300 buyers
present with at least 600 home sight
seers. The crowd was quiet and the
big new sale barn, well seated below
and in the gallery the entire circle of
the mammoth round barn presented
a picture of "white faces" young and
old, male and female, long to be re
membered by those present.
No bids less than $25 were offered
or taken. The two highest priced
ones sold were Repeater 63rd $8,100,
and Repeater 66th $7,000. The av
erage on 61 head was $1,256. The
total amount of the sale was $76,
025.00. Repeater 63rd went to J. D.
Canary & Son, Saratoga, Wyoming.
Repeater 66th went to J. O. Southard,
Comiskey, Kansas.
C. M. Akes. Leon, Iowa's grand old
Hereford breeder, and his son Robert
were here. Charley had picked Re
peater 63rd as the bull that he hoped
to buy for ten or twelve hundred, but
when the bidding started in thous
ands and soon went to five, six, sev
en and eight thousand Charley toc^k
"heart trouble" and slid down in his
opera chair, but Bob tried to persuade
his father to bid up, but Charley
gasped through his William Taft
mustache, "No, my son, ho we've got
no more bull than the "Bull Moose"
have."
Fred Reppert, one of the greatest
of great auctioneers in America, was
the "man of the day," and when you
take the notion that you have the
blues and wish to shake them, go and
listen to Fred's way of combining
ideas with pleasing effects, and ytu
are''free'from the blues.
Henry Cummins, an eleven year old
lad from Lela, Georgia, the youngest
top-notch Hereford expert judge in
the United States, was. here and
bought by his own judgment, a fine
one, Repeater 70th, calved Jan. 15,
1915, for $2050-.
1'. I. L.'s Entertained.
The gentlemen of the B. I. L.'s en
tertained the ladies of Chapter W. of
the P. E. O. Society at the assembly
room ®f the library last Wednesday
evening. The gentlemen had kept
their entertainment a. secret, al
though they had allowed it to leak
out that it would be a barbecue sup
per, and the ladies were somewhat
surprised when they were marched
downstairs and allowed to enter a
regular city cafeteria, the assembly
room having been converted into a
first-class cafeteria, with railings and
tables, and gentlemanly waiters.
Along the long serving counter were
placed the various dishes, all labeled
in French, with French chefs in white
caps and aprons ready to serve each
tray. And say, the men had prepar
ed about everything in the way of
good eats it was possible to conjure
up, starting with bouillon and ending
with ice cream and mints, and the
ladies were vociferous in their praise
of the good cooking and service. Af
ter the dinner was served a special
program was shown at the Idle Hour
theatre for the ladies and the B. I.
L.'s, and a hit was made when a slide
showing the emblem of the order was
flashed on the screen. It was a pleas
ant evening for all, especially the
ladies for the men did all the work.

A Lot of Writing on a Postal Card.

week offered a Brownie Camera as a
prize to the person who could write
the words "Cherrington's of Course"
on the back of an ordinary postal

THREE BIG SPECIALS.
"The Battle Cry of Peace" Friday,
"The Goose Girl" Saturday, "Car
men" Monday, at the Idle
Hour Tlieatre.
The Idle Hour theatre will present
the coming week the three biggest
and best special feature plays they
have ever given. On Friday the
great Blue Ribbon Special "The Bat
tle Cry of Peace," which takes two
and a half hours to show will be pre
sented. It is claimed to be a better
picture play than "The Birth of a
Nation, and at most of the places in
Iowa where it has been shbwn the
prices have ranged from 75 cents to
$2.00. The Idle Hour will give two
matinee Friday, the first at 1 o'clock
and the second at 3:30, and admis
sion for all at the matinee will be 25
cents. Two shows will be given in the
evening, the first at 7 o'clock, and
the second at 9:30, prices 25 and oO
cents. This is by far the biggest and
best thing in moving pictures which
has ever been shown in Leon and
may people from adjoining towns
have sent word they would attend.
Saturday night Marguerite Clark
comes in "The Goose Girl," a great
Paramount feature play. We had the
pleasure of seeing this play in a
large city and it is one of the best
we ever saw anywhere. Admission
at the 3 o'clock matinee will be 10
and 15 cents, and three shows will
be given in the evening, the first at
7 o'clock, prices 10 and 15 cents.
Take our word for it and don't misa
seeing "The Goose Girl."
On next Monday night, March 20,
Geraldine Farrar appears in a pic
turization of "Carmen," another big
Paramount feature play. Geraldine
Farrar is the most famous of all
women artists of today, and she will
be supported by an exceptionally
strong cast. Matinee at 3 o'clock,
three shows in the evening, the first
at 7 o'clock, prices lu and 20 cents.
"The Pennant" a Success.
The Pennant," a comic operetta,
presented at the opera house last
Friday night proved in every way a
great success.
The opening chorus consisted of
the college foot ball eleven aided by
the coach giving yells, songs and
practicing signals for the big game of
the season when Jack Lawson (Irv
ing Little), captain of the team en
ters, carrying flowers and candy for
Doris Bond (Edna Biggs). He is
cheered and jollied by the other fel
lows, but Irving proved himself an
ardent lover in the song "When a
.Fellow's in Love He's a Fool."
Juiiri Gaits as Verdant Green,"
freshman from up country not only
kept the audience in laughter but en
chanted them by his song "I Wish I
Had a Sweetheart Too" and his de
votion to the Merry Widow, Mrs.
Reno Grass (Freda Ferren). Dewey
Long as Lord Woodby Rich is to be
congratulated on the splendid man
ner in which he portrayed the char
acter of an heiress-hunting gentle
man and his solos were exceedingly
pleasing. Bruce Townsend took the
part of Levi Lender, the Jewish ped
dler and friend of Lord Rich and all
those who had the pleasure of see
ing him will no doubt say his solo
only
I'm Attending Strictly to Business"
was well worth the price of admis
sion. Ida Hazlet as Mrs. Bond and
Lynn Gardner as Mr. Bond were ex
ceptionally good in their parts and
although Mr. Bond was a self-made
business man, well under the domina
tion of his wife, he succeeded in mar
rying his daughter Miss Doris, to an
American instead of an English Lord.
Mrs. Bond showed her social ambi
