Brownsville, Tex.. March s5.--8.
teen United States soldiers guarding
the Barreda Bridge on the Frisco
Railway, fourteen miles north of
Brownsville, were attacked by a num
ber of Mexican bandits at to o'clock
tonight.
Many shots were exchanged, but
no casualties were suffered by the
Americans. No reports of casualties
among the bandits were obtainable.
When a southbound passenger train
reached the section house, 500 feet

troops and armed citizens were rushed
today from Marfa and Alpine to PresIdio,
Tex.. to assist a small patrol of United

ports received in Alpine today were that
the Mexican garrison at Ojlnaga, oppo
site PresidIo, threatened to move against

Santiago Rojas, a deputy sheriff of
Presidio, was reported today to have
been killed by Villa bandits a few miles
from Ojinaga.
The death of Col. Rojas, Carranza com
mander, at the hands of his own men,
who attempted to mutiny last night, was
comfirmed by telephone advices here to
day.
There are 400 Mexican soldiers in Oil
naga. All formerly were Villistas, and
were turned over by their commanders
without their 'onsent to the Carranza
government. When the report reached
Ojilnaga that Americani troops had been
permitted to cross into Mexico with the
consent of the Carranza government, the
OJinaga garrison revolted. The men de
manded of their commander, Col. Rojas.
that he leal them against PresIdIo to
avenge the invasion of Mexican terri

Col. Rojas refused to lead the expedi
tion. and was killed.
Presidio is sixty-five miles from a rail
road, in the Big Bend country of Texas,
and it is feared the relief expedition may
have to fight its way through, as the
country is Infested with Mexicans, and
has many small bands of bandits.

FEAR REPRISAL

French and British Say Teu
i tons Are Misinformed About
Adriatic Attacks.
CLAIM MADE THAT AUSTRIAN
SHIPS WERE NEARLY SUNK
No British Submarines Were Near
Those Vessels. Say Officials at
Embassy in Washington.
A puzzling and perhaps serious turn
has been given to the submarine contro
,ersy by reports made to Acting Secre
tary of State Polk yeaterday by Baron
Zwiedinek, fhe Austrian charge. The
reporits allege attacks on unarmed Aus
trian merchant vessels by submarines.
presumably British. They are in no way
substantiated by Impaitial evidence and
'all for no offneial action on the part
of the United States.
Their importance. it Is explained. lies
in the fact that they suggest reprisals
on the part of the entente powers and
atpear to pave the way for renewed sub
marine activity by German and Austrian
submarines.
Both the British and French embas
sies believe the reports are made solely
for the purpose of Justifying contem
plated sets against passenger or mer
chant vessels of the entente allies.
The contents of the report. contained
verbatum in yesterday morning's news
papers. concerned the assertion, via Ber
lin, that the Austrian steamer Daniel
Erno had nearly been torpedoed in the
Adriatic on Feb-uary 14 and that the
Austrian steamer VEagreb lhadjeesrly been
torPedned on February X Both were
nearly torpedoed near the same place
and the ubmarines that did the near
torpedoing were presumably British.
At the State Department it was said
that the 'nited States government would
make no investigation of the report.
There were no Amertcans on either ship.
and no damage was done. The fact that
ther, ae no British submarines In the
Adriatic is perhaps beside the point, it
is explained, for the witnesses, all Aus
trians and members of the crews, would
prohably be unanimous in declaring that
near-torpedoes would have sunk the
shIp had not timely dodging let the
miscules safely by. It is. therefore, felt
at the French and ritish embassies that
somei measures of reprisal will next be
heard from.
