NINfi CLUBS
Over $1000 Per Month Sent Out of
County to Buy Canned Goods.
Keep it at Home.
In our mad rush for fast living
at the present day rates some
times will remind us, if. we stop
to think, of the fiiuil who said to
his bonnie mate, "Dearie, let's
climb upon this chunk and watch
the turtles as they ko w hizzing
by." We sometimes think we
are living fast when, really, it is
a puzzle to know whether we are
living at all or not.
This week, I made a little can
vass of the grocery stores of Ma
rion and found these figures.
Money received by the merchants
for flour, $15,748: for meat and
lard, $15,948: for cabbage. $716;
for potatoes, $3,405: for canned
goods. J12.0i9. I did not get the
, figures on beans, syrup and oth-
er articles that could be produc
ed in Crittenden county, but
know they are enormous. There
are thirty-two other grocery
stores in the county, besides the
trading points that lie near our
borders, where many of our peo
ple go to buy their living.
At a TIN CAN CONVENTION
in the big ditch behind Baker &
Mayes' mill you will find repre
sentatives with their labels show
ing corn from Indiana, corn syr
up from New York, condensed
milk from the grass of some oth-
r state, peaches put up in Cali
:' forma, pickets from Colorado,
and many other States are rep
resented in this convention, but
not a single contribution from
home-Crittenden county. The
great wonder comes in trying to
think where we v get the money
with which to pay these contrib
uting States for all these good
things to eat Another little it
em of interest Is the enormity of
the amount of money it takes.
We will add the two numbers
and find the number of stores: 9
plus 32 is 41, the number of
stores in the county. If 9 stores
will sell $48,846 worth of grocer
' to to the people in one year's
time, how much will 41 stores
sell to a proportionate number of
people in one year? Some sev
enth grade pupil can solve this
little problem for you. Your
problem comes in teaching your
seventh grade child how to avoid
this awful mistake you are mak
ing. Had you ever thought that we
could sell this stuff to ourselves?
Had you ever thought that there
could be a canning club in every
school district in the county,
where, not only the goods used
during the winter months by the
fire community may be canned
antr put away at home, but nave
some to spare for your neighbor?
Had you thrjght what a little in
dustry this might create? They
tell me the canning outfit will
cost but little. Had you ever
thought that a nine year old boy
could raise a pig worth $15 on a
few bushels of corn, the scraps
from the kitchen, and may be, a
few young chickens, and enjoy
the fun all the time-getting an
education? Mine did last year.
Did you know potatoes and cab-
"baff would grow in Crittenden
county? Had you ever thought
of what fallacy it Is to work our
fool heads off fighting grass to
grow tobacco to buy potatoes,
cabbage and canned goods to eat
during the winter days? Think
it over. We have not stopped to
think these things over as we
should. Of course the groceryman
must have a living too, but whose
business is it to furnish it? If
you produce your own living at
home the groceryman will get
on just the same, i You know he
is a hustler or he would never
have been in the business.
Knocking?? No. Frugality is a
virtue to be admired in anyone.
The vital point in our case is
the redemption of our soil. We
have allowed our farm lands to
wash away and become depleted
by a one or two crop-system un
til we cannot make a living at
home. Crittenden in noted for
her great men an 1 women, not
so much at home, but you can
find them in almost every State
the Union, engaged in all avoca
tions known to the American
people-statesmen, professional
men, educator?, successful farm
ers, and, well -there may be
some tramps.
I will give you some more fig
ures that may cause you to think
but may explain why some of
our best people are not living in
Crittenden now. The records in
the County Superintendent's of
fice show that twenty years ago
there were one thousand more
schoil children in the county
than there are now. There has
been a falling o'J of three hund
red in the last six years. Here
is another little problem that
may come under the old "Rule of
Three." If the decrease in pop
ulation in twenty years is 1000,
how long will it take for Critten
den county to become nothing
more than an old thrown away
field, with no inhabitants except
the rabbits and the foxes, with
nobody to chase the foxes? Had
you 8topjed to think ahout it?
No! No!! You thought there
were more school children in the
county this year than ever be
fore. Do you ever visit your
neighbors? You ought to get ac
quainted with him-you might
like him.
You will find scores of our peo
ple in Illinois, Missouri. Arkan
sas, Oklahoma, Texas. Washing
ton, Oregon, California, New
Mexico and many in other States
all from Crittenden county.
There is a reason for this. Peo
ple love to live where they may
be satisfied. Satisfaction comes
from having a happy home in
which to live. Happy homes are
made from pleasant and prosper
ous surroundings. These can be
had by right thinking and right
acting. The blame must come
back to the farm and the rural
home. The country can get
along without the town, but no
town can prosper where the land
is poor. Must we let the bushes
grow upward and the gullies
grow downward? Must we stop
these gullies and grow vegetab
les, forage, etc., in the stead of
the bushes, or must we get into
the "band wagon" and follow
the others to someothor State?
It strikes me that we may be
classed as undesirable citizens
should we follow, because we
have allowed our homes to slide
from under us. Stop! Look!!
Listen!!! Knocking? Well. I
guess! -but somebody MUST do
some thinking!
The population of the world,
outside of Crittenden county
seems to be growing, and there
are a few things that can be done
that will still make Crittenden
the best place in the world in
which to live. Some of these
things are good roads, better
farming, more alrtuism between
country and town, and capital
and labor. If I am permitted to
continue this story in the Crit
tenden Record-Press I want to
show you that the schools can go
far in accomplishing a "Land of
Promise in Crittenden county
yet Yours very truly.

-Work to Help Tuberculosis
Patients in Kentucky.
On Tuesday evening, March
7 th, Miss Emma Hunt of the
State Tuberculosis Commission,
spoke to a large audience of rep
resentative men and women on
what Tuberculosis is doing in
Kentucky. So close to the hearts
of her audience did Miss Hunt
bring her work for the help of
Tuberculosis patients and the
business like methods the State
Commission has adopted for the
work, that the entire audience
volunteered their service to help
in the war on the white plague.
After Miss Hunt's address short
talks were made by Rev. Trotter,
and Rev. Chandler, of the
Methodist church on the church's
place in this war. He pointed
out that it was as much the
church duty to help the physical
as well as spiritual welfare of
man. Rev. Trotter was just as
forceful in his argument. They
were followed by Drs. Frazier
and Fox, Messrs. C. S. Nunn,
J. F. Dodge and T. H. Cochran.

Road Bonds At Premium.
Ballard county's '300.000. 4i
per cent, road bonds were sold
last week, bringing a bonus of
3,841. The purchasers were
the Fifth-Third National Bank,
and Breed, Elliott & Harrison
both of Cincinnati, Ohio.
All Kentucky county road
bonds seem to be selling at fan
cy premiums. Thus we may
reasonably expect Powell county
bonds to yield no less than $6,000
premium, and they will do so t
the bidders figure their interest
rate as low as they did in the
Ballard county bond purchase. -
