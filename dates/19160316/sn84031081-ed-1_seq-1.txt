From how many hundreds of miles
this force had been assembled, the
elements of Its armament, its num
bers and the direction or directions In
which its various columns headed
lifter they passed the international
line, were secrets held by the mili
tary censorship. The one important
fact, that the .Americans had gone in.
to Mexico again, was an event wit
nessed by hundreds of spectators who
crowded into Columbus. They saw
the troops move off toward the im
aginary boundary line, until when the
men crossed they were tin J", but dis

New lUuiment.s Arrive.
Uchlnd the troops who moved for
ward new regiments rapidly filled the
vacated campto in Columbus. The
Eleventh cavalry, from Fort Ogle
thorpe, Georgia, was one of the new
arrivals. The new regiments expect
ed to follow, but their officers would
not say how soon nor from what
points. The disposition of the first
aeroplane squadron, which pussed
west though bee last night, loaded
on flat cas, was one of t lie most in
teresting of the military secrets, be
ing the first actual campaign test of
this new arm of the service.
Unofficial reports came into El
Paso that about fifty miles west of
Columbus, near Hachita, N. M., an
other column had gathered and pro
bably had entered Mexico. Xothin
more definite than the fact of this
column's existence was established,
despite reports that these troops'
might have gone in first.

campaign.
General Pershing's report of his
entrance into Mexico served to dis

that resistance would be ottered bv
the troops of the de facto government.
Colonel liertani, the commanding of

they will not be revoked until there

Officials tonight refused to discuss
the subject, but there was reason to

This was accepted as convincing proof
of the attitude of the Carranza gov
