Since the year 1900 Geo. P.
Learnard has been established in
the piano business in Albuquer
que, and since that date has sold
more pianos to the people of
New Mexico than any other per
son in the state.
January 1, 1914, Mr. Learnard
conceived the idea that pianos
could be sold on a more satisfac
tory basis to both the purchaser
and himself by eliminating the
big items of store rent, partner
snip attairs, clerk hire and other
incidental expenses. Since that
date every piano purchaser has
shared in the saving of expenses.
All pianos are shipped direct from
the factory to purchaser, and Mr.
Learnard, accompanied by Mr.
Leon R Allen, Piano Tuner, now
travels overland contiii .lly and
calls personally on anyone who
desires information about pianos
and players, and especially those
who may be desirous of learning
about his new and successful
selling plans.
When you r ecome interested in
purchasing a piano write to Mr,
Geo. P. Learnard personally and
you will receive a prompt reply
and the satisfaction that you
desire when you place your
hard earned dollars in the pur
chase of a piano for your home
and little ones. Mail this today.

To Whom it May Concern:
this is to certify that I have
sold the Saddle Stallion "King
High Falutin" No, 4655, to W.
W. Wagner of Mcintosh, N. M.
He is without a doubt one of
the very best Saddle Stallions in
the United States, and a better
bred horse would be hard to find.
When a two-year-old he was ex
hibited in Kentucky, he met and
defeated the very best. The fol
lowing year when a three-year-old
he was exhibited through
Kentucky, Tennessee and Mis
souri at the largest fairs and
never met defeat. At the age
of four he was exhibited 22 times
and never met defeat. At the
age of five he was exhibited 19
times and was 19 times first. He
won the Championship class at
Sikeston ($500.00) where he met
and defeated all the good ones
from Kentucky, Tennessee and
Missouri.
I will say to tnose wanting to
breed mares breed to "King
High falutin" while you have
the chance he breeds large with
finish and action. He is abso
lutely a sure foal getter, 70 per
cent guaranteed. One of his
colts, a 3-year-old stud, sold at
$1250.00 last fall and a 2-year-old
mare at $750.00. "King High
Falutin" No. 4055 has no su
perior in the saddle class. This
horse is simply a wonder, and I
truly hope that he will receive
the patronage which he deserves
Signed, California, Missouri,
this 6th day of March, 1916.
H. L. Duvenick.
In a letter of March 10th, 1916,
Mr. Duvenick further writes:
"I can cheerfully say for this
grand good horse that as a sire
of high class finished colts "King
Jrligh falutin has no superior.
As a high class Baddle stallion he
has but very few equals as he
has met and defeated the be9t
horses the country affords.
To the stock raisers of New
Mexico breed your mares to
this grand horse while you have
the chance ship and send your
mares to his court although the
distance may be 100 to 200 miles.
I think "King High Falutin" one
of the best saddle stallions and
sires in the United States today. "
