SOME WERE THERE BEFORE
Omaha was "Invaded" by United
States troops twice yesterday, the
first time In the morning when erst
while Villa , "chasers" from Fort
Robinson, Neb., arrived at the Web
ster street station on a special train
over the Northwestern, and again
last night when the United States
regulars from Fort Meade, 8. D.f
pulled in on another special.
Troops I, K, L and M of the
Twelfth cavalry from Fort Meade,
Colonel J. C. Waterman command
ing, comprising nine oflcers and
about 250 men, arrived at 7 o'clock
yesterday evening.
The Fort Meade troop special was pre
ceded by the train of Impedimenta, con
sisting of thirty-six cars with about two
score men aboard to care for the horses
and mules. In the train were several
cars filled 'with hay and (rain and field
equipment.

The troop train of Bine coaches re
mained at the Webster street station
Ion enough to be watered, after which
It was taken to Bouth Omaha by the
Missouri Pacific, going- south to Kansas
City about 10:S0 o'clock. The train of
Impedimenta preceded the troop special
out of South Omaha, the latter following
within the "block."
Bon Look mt dir.
Being given an hour at the Webster
street station In which to eat and stretch
their travel-cramped limbs, the Fort
Meade soldiers swarmed fro mth coaches
like a crowd of schoolboys out for a lark
and scattered to the four winds to enjoy
the precious sixty ratnutes. '
Pedestrians on Sixteenth street 'found
the Fort Mteade contingent talkative cav.
alrymen, any any interrogation on wliaT
the villa followers were going to get
when'they".ot to Meslco. met with a
reedy and tlnfely repiy. Most of the men
vouchsafed the Information without be
ing questioned that they were Itching for
a "run In", with Villa and his crowd.
The troops left Fort Meade, near Stur
f Is, S. D., at 10 o'clock. Tuesday morning,
Cemmiad la Good Shave. '
i Colonel Waterman and his officers de
clared that the command Is In exoelleirt
shape and well prepared for anything
that may turn up on the Villa bandit
chase.
Notwithstanding the uncertainty of the
hour of arrival, a fair alzed crowd was
on hand to meet the epeclal from Fort
Meade. The absence of a band did not
give the evening "reception" as martial
patriotic and curious Omahans who were
there made up In enthusiasm what they
lacked In numbers, t
M Leap from fan.
North Omaha was full of soldiers In
the morning. Troopers from Fort Robin
son, Neb., could not wait for their train
to reach the Webster Street depot. Most
of them Jumped off at Grace street and
walked down Sixteenth street
Traveling on a special train over the
Northwestern, Colonel If. a. Sickle com
manding. Troop F and O of the Twelfth
cavalry from Fort Robinson, nine officers,
2 S3 men and the regimental band. of twenty-nine
pieces, with Ed J. Hendricks,
leader, arrived about o'clock. The men
were greeted with loud and prolonged
cheers as they detrained, and scattered
for a short time to straighten their legs
after a continuous ride of twenty-eight
hours.

sanitation to Full Strength is
Unanimously Approved.
CONGRESSMAN BURNETT BALKS
WASHINGTON, March 15. The
senate today approved unanimously
the joint resolution adopted by the
house yesterday to bring the mobile
army to its full strength, which
would add about 20,000 men to the
present estimate.
It is planned to get the army bill
proper on the senate calendar before
the end of the week. .
Dispatches to the State and Navy
departments from the prniclpal ports
on both Mexican ' coasts' today re
ported conditions orderly and no ap
parent anti-American feeling.
The resolution now goes tor-lhe presi
dent for his approval. ;
' - Roil Call la Seaate.
A rail call on tha resolution was or
dered on request of Senator Oallinger,
who explained that he asked it for the
purpose of "demonstrating that there Is
no division in the senate over measures
to provide for protection of the country."
There was not a dissenting vote on the
roll call. ,
Unanimous consent for consideration of
tha resolution was asked by Chairman
Chamberlain of the military committee as
soon as the senate assembled.
Senator Vardaman, democrat, urged
immediate action for the moral support
It would give to the campaign against
Villa, but ' the vote was delayed while
Senator Newlands, democrat, spoke on
preparedness and urged his proposal for
a Joint congressional committee to co
ordinate defense legislation.
Harnett Blocks Army Bill.
Prospects of advancing the army bill In
the house over the Immigration bill were
endangered today, when Chairman Bur
nett of the Immigration committee de
clined to yield from his agreement with
Speaker Clark for recognition as soon as
the free sugar .bill. Is passed.
"I won't yield my place to the army
bill or any other measure, not even If the
president requests It." said Mr. Burnett.
"The speaker has promised to recognise
me as soon as the free sugar bill Is dis
posed of and I expect him to do it."
The rules subcommittee, which Is work
ing to advance' the army bill, however.
has not lost hope. It is believed the army
bill will be reached early next week at
the latest.

Desert and Mountains Are First
Foes American Army Must Meet
EL PASO, Tex., March U.-The point
chosen for the entrance of the punitive
expedition into Mexico Is at tha verge
of a dreary, desolate plain. Inhabited
principally by coyotes and prairie dogs,
swept by sand storms and denuded of
vegetation excepting cactus snd a few
other spiky and objectionable growths.
For st least thirty miles the soldiers of
the t'nited Ptales must make their way
across this edsert. They then reach the
lowest range of tha Sierra Mad re moun
tains, rialng to a height of 1.0)0 to S.6u0
feet, broken and twisted Into all manner
of fantastic shapes by volcanic- action,
and as barren .of. verdure worthy of
name as the desert over which they
frown. Lonely, half -civilized ranchmen
are found here and there In the valleys,
nursing their rattle at the infrequent and
scanty water holes and subsisting almost
entirely on beef. To offset the evil re
sults of a.conUuuous diet of cow flesh.

There are about l.Oce troops In this town

by General Gavtre to frequent saloons.
Nothing stronger than beer Is permitted

' "My soldiers are absolutely loyal an
there Is no danger of any outbreaks In

Colonel Rlojas haa been murdered by tha

ever for any hostility toward American

assurances that all troops In my district'

KL PASO, Tex., March 18.
American troops were on Mexican
soli tonight sixty miles west of here.
The vanguard of an expedition gath
ered In leas than a week), but never
theless one of tho most powerful
country Blnce the war between the
states.
They were out on the Identical
hills where one week ago tonight
Pancho Villa led 1,20 of his bandits
stealthily up to the American border,
to make an early rush upon tho
sleeping American city ot Columbus
N. M., and murdered seventeen
Americans, eight of them soldiers
and one a woman. ,
Direction Mystery
From how many hundreds of
miles this force had been assembled,
the elements of Us armament. Its
numbers and the direction or direc
tions in which Its various columns
went after they passed the Interna
tional line waa a secret held by the
military censorship.
The one Important fact that the Ameri
cans had gona Into Mexico again waa an
event witnessed by hundreds of spectators 1
who crowded Into Columbus. They saw
the troops move off toward tha Imaginary
boundary line, until when the men crossed
they wei tiny, but distinct brown lines
In the distance In the clear western air.
As the troops passed farther Into low
gravel hills cloud of white dust hid tha
men and their further movements as
effectually as the censorship. Brilliant
sunshine occasionally caught the flash of
the soldiers' accoutrements.
Behind the troops who moved forwar
new regiments rapidly filled thevaoate4
campa In Columbus. The Eleventh cavalry
from Fort Oglethorpe, Ga.. was one of
the new arrivals. -
Air Fleet Loaded.
The new regiments expected to follow,
bu their officers would not say how soon,
nor from what points. The disposition
of the First aeroplane squadron, which.
passed west through here lact night
loaded on flat cars, waa one of the most
interesting of the military secrets, being
the first actual campaign test of this new
arm of the service.
Unofficial reports came Into EI Paae
that about fifty mllr west of Columbus,
near Hachlta, N. M., another column had
gathered and probably had entered Mex
ico. Nothing more definite than the fact
of this column's existence wss estab
lished, despite reports that these troops)
might have gone In first.

SAN ANTONIO. Tex., March 15. -General
John J. Pershing, with mora than
4,000 troops, began the pursuit Into Mex
ico today of Francisco Villa. General
Pershing s report that ha and bis com
mand had crossed the International
boundary Una just south of Columbus
reached General Frederick Funston late
today.
Reports of progress In the country
where the search haa been begun will ba
made by General Pershing to General
Funston, but It Is not expected these will
be frequent or deal with any but tha !
more important developments. How far
Into Mexico the column bad reached to- .
night waa unknown here. Not until aftar
Friday are sharp developments expected. .
Colonel George A. Dodd, heading a
smaller column that entered Mexico some
distance west of Columbus, also Is moving
Ins southerly direction, snd these twe
forces should be within touch of each
other before the end of tha week. By
that time It la expected an Infantry sup
port will hold tha line of communication
along which motor trucks for the trans
portation of ammunition and supplies will
be operated.
Ceasorablp SOU In Fore.
Although tha censorship 1 m posed by
General Funston was relaxed tonight, ef
forts still were made to keep secret tb
details of the plan of tbe campaign.
General Pershing's report of, his en
trance into Mexico served to dispel to a
great extent fears that had been enter
