' , If further proof were needed to show that Bchools In wet town
are blighted instead of helped by saloons, it is found that in th tojr
towns listed above there is one higli school graduate for every twty
one of school population, while in tho wet towns there is ono graduate,
for evory thirty-nine, an advantage for the dry towns of almost 1001
per cent. These figures are taken from the official reports for iastj
spring commencements, filed with tho state university. .
In the 205 accredited high schools of tho state, those In tkt dry
townB enroll an average of 262.6 per 1,000 of school population, and
tho avorage attendance is 228.8 per 1,000. . J
In-the wet towns the enrollment is 122.3 per 1,000 school popul-,
tion, and tho average attendance is only 102.6 per 1.000. Again, sua'
advantage for tho dry towns of more than 100 por cent.
No person can raise the cry of "picking" the town, for thaia'
official figures include every ono of the high schools in Nebrattft.
There is but ono answer to it. Banish the saloon. '
