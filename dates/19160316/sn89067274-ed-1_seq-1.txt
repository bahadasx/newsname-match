Paris, March 15. The credits re
quired for the second quarter of 1916
amounted to $1,560,000,000, according
to the statement prepared by Raoul
Peret, reporter of the Budget Com
mittee of the Chamber of Deputies,
and presented yesterday in the cham
ber. This is equivalent to a daily ex
penditure of $17,400,000. The figures
showed that the cost of carrying on
the war is steadily increasing, as the
total expenditure for the . year 1915
amounted to $400,000,000, where as
that of the first six months of 1916
amounts to $3,140,000,000.
The total national expenditure from
the beginning of August, 1914 to the
end of June, 1916, will be nearly $9,
400,000,000, of which $7,400,000,000
are purely for military purposes.

KETT DIED FRIDAY HIGHI
Judge of This District of the Circuit
Court For Many Years Died
In St. Louis Friday.
HEART DISEASE CAUSE DEATH
Was a Resident of Montgomery City
Had Been m for Six Weeks
at St John's Hospital
Judge J. D. Barnett, of the Audrain
County Circuit Court, died of heart
trouble shortly after 8 o'clock, Friday
evening, at the new St. Johns hospital,
St Louis. Judge Bamett has been an
inmate of the hospital for sometime
and has been steadily growing weaker.
Judge Barnett has been a Judge for
SO years and so popular among Demo
cratic voters that only once in his car
eer did he have opposition in his race
for office.
Graduated From Washington U.
Judge Bamett was born on"his fath
er's farm near Wellsville, Montgomery
County, October 11, 1868, the only son
of Dr. Andred F. Barnett, pioneer Mis
souri physician.
He was educated in St Louis, being
graduated from high school there in
1876, and from the law department of
Washington University in 1879. The
same year was admitted to the bar in
Danville, Montgomery County.
Eighteen Years in Probate Court
In 1886, although without political
aspirations, friends persuaded him to
be a candidate for Probate Judge, and
he was elected without opposition,
serving 18 years continuously.
In 1904 he was prevailed upon to be
a candidate for Judge of the Eleventh
Judicial Circuit, which then included
Audrain, Montgomery, Lincoln, War
ren and St. Charles counties, and in
1910 was re-elected over Judge E. B.
Woolfolk of Troy.
Shortly afterwards there was a divi
sion of the Eleventh Circuit and up
to the time of his death Judge Har
nett's circuit included Audrain, Mont
gomery and Warren counties. Judge
Woolfolk now presides over the Thir
ty-fifth Circuit, including Lincoln,
Pike and St. Charles counties.
Judge Barnett was a bachelor and
lived with an older sister, Miss Helen
Barnett, in Montgomery City. Miss
Barnett was at the bedside when the
end came, ,
Cousin of Tom P. Barnett
Judge Barnett was a cousin of Geo.
D. and Tom P. Barnett St Louis
architects. -
Judge Barnett was a member of the
Roman Catholic Church and a high
minded gentleman and jurist of abil
ity. During his stays in Mexico, -while
court was in session, he made hun
dreds of admiring friends. . He w.is
always just and fair, in his work upon
the bench and was held in the highest
esteem by all the members of the bar
practicing in his court
Audrain Bar Meets.
Judge David Harris, of the 34 Judi
cial circuit who has been holding court
hr? during the illness of Judge Barnett
adjourned court Friday afternoon un
til Monday, March 20. All cases from
the 13th to 20th will be docketed on
that date. In closing Court Judge

ing the opportunity to preside in the
Audrain "County Circuit Court and
complimented the bar upon its person
ell though he regretted the sad death
of such a splendid judge as Judge
Barnett W. W. Fry replied for the
Audrain bar and expressed its pleas
ure in having him in the local Court.
Mr. Fry said he had practiced law here
since 1876 and had always been proud
of the men who composed its member
ship and none of whom had ever, in
any way, caused the slightest reflec
tion upon the profession.
A meeting of the Audrain county
bar was called immediately following
the adjournment of Court and Judge
Harris was chosen to preside and Cir
cuit Clerk Eppa F. Elliott chosen as
secretary. On the motion of Judge
W. W. Botts, S. D. Stocks, E. A.

pointed on a committee to secure a
suitable floral offering from the Aud
rain county bar for Judge Barnett'a

committee to draft a suitable mem
orial to be spread upon the records of
the Audrain County, Circuit County
and Probate Courts and the St Louis
Appellate Court and to be presented
to Judge Barnett's sister; A. C. Whit
son, R. D. Rodgers, A. C. Barnes, E.

Celebrated Their New Years Day
This Tear
MANY CHINESE FESTIVALS
Burning of the Kitchen God is Perhaps
the Host Interesting, Takes Place
Every Year
Moka Garden,
Souchow, China.
Feb. 10, 1815.
Mr. Mitchell White,
Mexico, Mo.
Dear Mr. White: ,
It is true the West can't hustle the
East tut the West must hustle in the
East so while I've intended to write
time in her flight has left only the
recollection of what I meant to do.
The Chinese as a nation have their
only rest day or holiday of the year at
the China New Year time. This is
variable with the years, and this year
China's New Year Day was Feb. 2, so
we are just in the midst of the holiday.
All shops are closed, schools are clos
ed, and everything practically stops
for a month among the non-Christians.
The Mission schools only close for two
or three weeks.
There are many interesting festi
vals and ceremonies among the non
Christians. Perhaps the most inter
esting is the burning of the kitchen
god. Every household has a kitchen
god, which listenes to everything that
happens all year, and then at tho end
of the year is taken out and burned.
When taken out they fill it's mouth
with sugar so any reports given in the
outer world will be modified as much
as possible. The burning takes place
three days before the China New Year
Day, and then for three days there is
no kitchen god in the household. Dur
ing these three days they can quarrel
fight and do just as they please be
cause there's no one to tell on them.
Then on China New Year Day the new
god is brought in and installed with a
great feast fire-works, etc.
Another very interesting feature is
the sacrificing of the God of Wealth.
For months before, one can see small
shops here and there making paper
figures of fishes, birds, and animals,
and these being burned on the second
day of the New Year are supposed to
bring the sacrificer much prosperity
during the New Year.
There are many other features of
the celebration which would be of in
terest if I understood enough of Chin
ese life and custom to know all the
meanings of them. Firecrackers are
continuous during the entire time, and
guns and cannons occasionally.
There seems to be something very
attractive and fascinating about tho
festivities of China New Year, and so
we have to plan special things for the
Christians during these weeks to make
the temptation as light as possible.
They visit a great deal at this time,
so we keep open house and receive
them at all times, also visit them as
much as possible. After the first few
days we have revival services under
the union management of all Chris
tian missions in Souchow. We are
using every available place this year.
The men's and women's meetings are
held separately, and all seem to be a
great success this year. The one here
in the Embroidery School Chapel has
been very well attended, and splendid
interest has been shown.
I have enjoyed the copies of the
Ledger I have seen.but it seems use
less to try to send it now. I receive
only about one copy out of four, and
then a bunch of wrappers occasional
ly. Thank you very much.
Very sincerely,

URGES SAVING OF RAGS, PAPER.
The savings of rags, old papers and
magazines would help United States
paper manufacturers, whose supply of
material has been curtailed seriously
as a result of .the European war, ac
cording to announcement by the De
partment of Commerce at Washing
ton, D. C.
. Officers of large St Louis concerns
which handle paper or Us products
said recently that in most American
homes old paper and rags are regard
ed as refuse and that enormous quan
tities are destroyed annually.
In this country the market for rags
facturers, who use the rags instead of
cotton, the latter being much more
expensive.
In consequence, within the last two
months mills which turn out writing
paper, wrapping paper and book
stock have advanced their prices 30
per cent or more. About the same in
crease has been mads in newspaper
stock, although the larger proportion
of wood pulp employed in the latter
renders it more independent of linen.
, "There is an increased demand for
paper, amounting to 15 to 25 per
cent," said S. L. Willson, vice presi
dent of the Graham Paper Company.
"At the same time the supply of ma
terials for making paper has become
smaller, and there is no relief in
sight"
Old paper stock, forn erly worth $4
to $5 per ton ,is now selling at $12 to
$15 per ton, for use by the paper
manufacturing mills. The rags used
to sell at $1.75 per hundred pounds and
are now worth as high as 5 cents per
pound, or $5 per hundred pounds.-

LIKES HIS WORK IN NEW YORK
When He First Went to New York
the Change. Was Too Much for
Him and He Disliked It
It is the long step for the life of
an active city superintendent of
schools at Mexico to the life of a stu
dent in Columbia University, New
York. Life in pigeon hole No. S18 on
the ninth floor of a New York sky
scraper is quite different from life
with my family in the comfortable
cottage on Wood lawn. I may also
add that the dining service in a Mis
souri home, presided over by a south
ern home making expert is also some
what different from the cafetarias and
automatic lunches in New York.
However, I am becoming adjusted to
the new way of living and have time
and energy for a short messago to tho
people at home.
I wish to endorse, most heartily the
action of the Board of Education in
providing for the physical examina
tion of the children at school. I
trust that this may mark the begin.
ning of the movement at Mexico to
conserve the health and strength of
our children. There has been no
more important movement in educa
tion during the last two decades than
that of the conservation of the health
of school children by regular medical
inspection of schools. This move
ment has gained such headway that
there are over five hundred cities
in the United States today that are
doing regular and definite work along
this line. ' It has passed the earlier
stage of "medical inspection" and has
entered the field of preventative medi
cine. Its keynote is the cultivation
of the health of all and the preven
tion of defectiveness in any by the hy- j
gienic supervision of all school ac- j
tivities.
A few quotations from a new book
on Public School Administration, pub
lished last month, by Professor E. P.
Cubberley, of Leland Stanford Uni
versity, one of the foremost authori
ties in the United States on school
problems, will carry conviction as to
the importance of the movement
"Only about four per cent of the
school children, statistics show, need
to be excluded in any one year on ac
count of contagious diseases, while
fifty to sixty per cent of the children
suffer from non-contagious physical
defects, which interfere more or less
with educational procedure, and which
need to be taken into account by school
authorities. The problem is how best
to conserve the child's native physical
vigor and to overcome, as far as pos
sible, his hereditary or- acquired phy
sical deficiencies, not only that his
progress in school may be normal, but
that he may develop Into a strong and
sound human being, knowing how to
care for himself.. . . .Results obtained
in many American and European cit
ies have clearly demonstrated that a
very small added cost from ten to
seventy-five cents per pupil per year,
varying somewhat with the kind of
health service provided: for a room
of forty pupils an additional daily ex
pense of from two to sixteen cents
per room will provide a health service
which will increase the value of the
instruction offered out of all propor
tion to its actual cost"
Mexico has one of the best school
systems in the middle West and has
now reached a point, when, in my
judgement, it would be wise to give
more attention to the health of the
children by the employment of a regu
lar school nurse for either part or full
time as the size of the school may re
quire. Later, I hope to write of some of the
modem movements in education which
are attracting nation-wide attention
and are causing the complete reor
ganization of the school systems of
some of our leading cities.
Yours sincerely,
HERBERT PRYOR
