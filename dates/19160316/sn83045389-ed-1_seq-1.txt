i "Few people understand that the
?proportions assumed by the interest in
tie Shakespeare Pageant are fully
j astonishing to us as to the general
, public Fully a year atro a plan was
conceived of having a small paueant
of r.fto or i>00 people, but the plan was
abandoned in January because those
of us who would naturally carry the
chief burden l.-lt that the drafts upon
our time would be too heavy. The in
terest already created, however, forced
us about a month a fro back into the
execution of our plan, but the small
undertaking from which \vc had ielt
; const rained to withdraw stiddenlv as
sumed of itself proportions to be tie-i
scribed only as collossal. The stimulus,
from such widespread interest has been!
enormous, but We havt felt deeply tho
responsibilities involved It ought :o!
be made clear to all that we never?
dreamed at the beginning of havinu
s.> splendid a challenge put upon ocr
power to succeed
"Another fact to be madt cleat is !
tin-, that we are .--till working with j
'an empty treasury. F.xcept for ilrt ad- ,
vanceu by the members of one com- '
' mitiee for admission fees, im funds at
all have been received towards ex- '
? peases, and Net with this empty i
treasury and the limited time left for j
preparations, we have had to equip 1
and carry on a large pageant ofliee, !
employ stenographers, disseminate in- '
formation, satisfy the demand for
j coaches, begin to make the properties,
telegraph, telephone and do iiinutner

j with expenditure. We make no claims

ourselves explain the conditions

The on?* important fact th;^ the
Americans had gone into Mexico again
was an e\ ent witnessed by hundreds of
spectators who crowded suto Columbus.
I They saw the troops move oft' towards
the boundary line, until when the men
I crossed they were tiny, but distinct,
' brown.liues in the instance in the clear
Western an As the troops passed
j farther into the low gravel hills, clouds
? of white dust hid the men and their
| further movements as effectually as
the censorship. Behind the troops
: who moved forward, new regiments
rapidly filled t h ?- vacated camps in
Columbus. The Kleventh Cavalry, of
Kort Oglethorpe, tin . was one of the
; new arrivals.
I More new regiments are expected to
follow, hut oflicers would not say how
j soon nor from what points. The dis?
, position of the First Aeroplane Squad

American troops across the Mexican
border to-night seeking Villa an<l his
bandits. President Wilson und ofllelnls
of the War Department resigned them
selves to wait possibly many rtaj s for
news of developments in the
information that forces of the de fa-to
i Mexican covornment were co-opcraft*
I with the expedition from the Uni't-.l
'states served to relieve tense anxiity
that liad heen apparent on all .stilus
lover the possibility of Carranza troops
revolting against their commanders
and attempting to oppose the ent-y
! of the Americans.
i Although Brigadier-General Pershing
antl Colonel Oodd marched into Mexico
j with some ."?,000 men about noon to-f'ay.
it was not until more than six hours
j afterwards that the official announce
ment came to Washington. It was re
! oeivod this evening, and Secretary
Baker at once hurried to the White
House for a conference with the PresS
? lent.
UK KA( TO <;OVKIlX.MISXT
\ I?|* \ ItHXTI.V ( O-OPKRATIMi
At 1" o'clock the secretary made this
I a nnouncerncnt:
"Tl>e department received to-nigM.
in rode. .1 message from iJencral I'uns
;on. which announces that American
troops crossed the border into Mexico
j to-day, but does not ?i>c the hour of
'the cross-ing. 1 am very happy to pay
i that the dispatch shows that the mili
tary representative of the de facto gov
! eminent of Mexico not only interposed
' no obstacle, but appears to be co-oper
I a ting."
Secretary Baker made it clear that
be bad not gi\en out the whole of
! General Kunston's dispatch. lie said
j that while the expedition was in prog
ress the department would make, ptib
! lie no details which might Interfere
with General Kunstoit . ..>ns for se
;crecy.
Ortii.ers of the general staff were on
j duty at the department until late tc>?
? night, but, so far as could be learned,
[no additional information of Import
ance had been received. General lrun?
ton is expected to report only when
there are developments, and it Is gen
erally understood that there is lttt'.o
probability of a clash between the
Amorlean troops and the bandits be
fore Friday or Saturday.
i Reports to-night told of Goneral Ob
! regon. Carranza's new Secretary of War
and chief military man. ordering Gen
eral Gaviria, commander of the Juarea
(garrison, to co-operate in every way
j with the United States forces. This
j was accepted as convincing proof of
j the at titude of the Carranza govern
; mcnt, and any remaining fears of tnn
| :>lo between the Americans and soldiers
, of the de facto government are ^... ??
j on the possibility of insubordination op
j of mistaken identity.
? MAINTAINS UIG1D MI.KNCE
W TO SITUATION ON BOIlDEIt
Throughout the day the War De
partment maintained rigid silence aa
j to the situation on the border. Gen
eral Kunston was moving his ptcces
1 in the grim xame with V'tlla behind a
curtain of complete secrecy. It prob
ably was 'he most complete censorship
the countrv has ever known, and the
'department itself was uui advised of
iii' crossing until hours after the
troops were on the march.
The onl> dispatch to the border
? situat'coi received by Secretary Haker
during the afternoon dealt with the
departure of the Kleventh Cavalry
from Chattanooga to re-enforce the
border patrol.
Humors which dew about the cor
ridor.-- of the War Department all day
dealt with reported fighting ? *? both
' sides of the border. One said a re2.
tnent of American cavalry had beet)
i annihilated, hut otllcials had no repo'-!?
011 which such statements could hav e
been founded.
Only meager now.s bulletins from
the troops in Mexleo arc expected, as
? the four rorrcspondents of prc.ss i:?ko
ci.it ions allowed to accompany CSoncral
F'orahing's fonrrffand n ill be. under
strict censorship. .Nothing that could
