AMERICAN ARMY CROSSES MEXICAN BORDER;

MEXICANS SHOW EVIDENCES OF STRONG
FEELING OF HOSTILITY TOWARD U. S.
Not Before Friday Are
Sharp Developments
Really Expected.
SAN ANTONIO, Texas, March 15,—
Gen. John .1. Pershing, with more
than 4,000 troops, began the pursuit
into Mexico todaj of Francisco Villa.
General Pershing's report that he and
his command had crossed the inter
national boundary line, just south of
Columbus, reached Gen. Frederick
Funston late today. Reports of pro
gress in the country where the search
has been begun, will bo made by Gen
eral Pershing, to General Funston, but
it is not expected these will be fre
quent or deal with any but the more
important developments.
How far into Mexico the column had
reached tonight was unknown here.
Not until after Friday are sharp de
velopments expected.
Col. George A. Dodd, heading a
similar column that entered Mexico
some distance west of Columbus, also
Is moving in a southerly direction,
and these two forces should be with
in touch of each other before the
end of the week. By that time it is
expected an infantry support will hold
the line of communication along which
motor trucks for the transportation of
ammunition and supplies will be
operated.
Although the censorship imposed by
General Funston was relaxed tonight,
efforts still were made 'to keep secret
the details of the plan of campaign.
General Pershing's report of his en
trance into Mexico served to dispel
to a great extent Bears that had been
entertained in some quarters that re
slstance would be ojffered by the troops
of the de facto government.
Colonel Bertani* the commanding
officer of the Carranza garrison at
Palomas, on the sojath side of the line.
joined General Pershing. His force
was only some 400jmen, but they were!
reported to have displayed willingness
and even eagerness to join in the
chase. As a body, the Mexican troops;
will remain under their own command-!
er, hut a number 1 of them are being
employed as scouts by General Persh
ing.
General Pershing has gone into
Mexico with orders to wipe out Villa
and his organIzaAion. 1'nless orders
to the contrary;, 1 are received from
those higher In authority than Gen
eral Funston, the campaign that was
begun today will continue until Villa
is captured or lulled. No limits have
been placed on It he field of operations.
News that the expedition was under
way reduced tension evident at army
lieadjuarters here during the earlier
part of the d^y. It was expected the
troops would cross earlier in the day
hut minor troop movements and other
details of organization delayed the
start.
There now are available in this de
partment for operations in Mexico,
more than 20,000 troops, and if the
plans for recruiting the companies to
full strength are carriedYiut, tilts num
ber will be increased quickly.
Cavalry posts have been relieved by
infantry in most cases in order to fur
nish a more mobile force for the pur
suit of Villa, although in expedition
that went in today there is a consid
erable force of artillery, which can
lie reinforced at any time by several
more batteries that now are held on
the American side within easy distance
of the border.
If the exact whereabouts of Villa are
known at army lieadjuarters, the fact
has not. been disclosed. Generally, it
is believed he has moved southward
toward the Guerrero district, in the
foothills of the Sierra Madres, but re
ports from Mexican sources indicate
that the de facto government troops
will do their best to turn him north
ward towards the advancing American
columns.
Bands affiliated with Villa in other
parts of Northern Mexico have not in
dicated their intentions, but brisk ac
tivity on their part will be no surprise
to the American army officers, it is
expected that in chasing Villa these,
hands will have to be engaged from!

BULLETIN.
DOUGLAS, Ariz., March 15.—
Numerous reports have reached
the United States military author

assembly was sounded from the mili

summoned to quarters. This was ex

copies of military orders issued to
the expeditionary force and re
ceived here indicate that news
dispatches from the correspond
ents with the troops will not be
passed by the censor for several
days.
The country through which Col.
George A. Dodd's command will
traverse is extremely rugged. It
is a succession of hills and moun
tains, topped by irregular, rocky
peaks and crossed by valleys and
canons. Scattered through this
territory are large stock ranches
with thousands of head of horses
and cattle. Some of it is desert,
with here and there skeletons of
cattle which strayed too far from
water holes.
Tens of supplies have been sent
forward from here overland to the
border, which at the point where
the troops went in is 50 miles
from Hachita. Motor trucks, camp
wagons and teams of ranchers in
this section are being worked to
the limit, forwarding tons of sup
plies for Colonel Dodd's command.
Each truck and wagon moves un

teamsters are Mexicans. Small
patrol camps are scattered along
the road as far as the border.
Beyond, into Mexico, the system
for guarding communications has
not been revealed.

WASHINGTON, March 15. -With
American troops across the Mexican
border tonight, seeking Villa and his
bandits, President Wilson and officials
of llie war department resigned them
selves to watt possibly many days for
news of developments in the chase.
Information that forces of the de facto
Mexican government were cooperat
ing with the expedition from tlm Uni
ted States, served to relieve anxiety
tlial had been apparent, on all sides
over the possibility of I'urrunza troops
revolting against their commnnilcrs
and attempting to oppose the entry
of tin* Americans.
Although Brigadier General Persh
ing and Colonel Dodd marched into
Mexico with Home 5,000 nten about
noon today, It was not until morn
t tin it six hours afterwards that the of
ficial announcement came to Washing
tun. It was received this ('Veiling and
Secretary linker at once hurried to
the White House fora conference with
the president. At 10 o'clock the sec
retary made iinmniiicomeiil that Uni
ted Slates troops had crossed the bor
der.
Secretary linker made It clear tlint
he had not given out the whole of
General Funstou's dispatch. He said
while the expedition was in progress
Hie department would make politic no
details which might interfere with
General Funston's plan:: for secrecy.
Officers of tlm general stuff were
on duty st Hie depnrliiienl until late
loliiglil, Iml so far as could lie learned
no additional Information of impor
tniiee had been received. General
Fiiuslon Is expected to report only
when there are developments, and it
Is generally understood that there Is
lltlle probability of ii clash between
the American troops and the bandits
before Friday or Saturday.
Reports tonight told of General
ohrcgoii, Carranza's new secretary or
war and chief military man, ordering
General Gnvlrn, commander of the
Juarez garrison, to cooperate in ev
ery way with the United Stales forces.
Tills wus accepted as convlliolng proof
of iho attitude of the Carranza gov
ernment and any remaining fears of
trouble between the Americans and
soldiers of the de facto government
are based on the possibility of instil)
ordinal Inn or of mistaken identity.
Throughout the day the war depart
ment maintained silence us lo the sit
nation on the border. General Funstim

with Villa behind a curtain of secrecy.
II probably was the most complete
censorship the country has ever
known. The screen was drawn so
close Gnu the department itself was
not advlsod of the crossing until hours
after the troopH were on the march.
The only dlHpateli as to the border
situation received by Secretary Baker
during the afternoon, dealt with the
departure of the Eleventh cavalry
from Chattanooga to reinforce the
border patrol.
Rumors flew about the corridors of
the war department all duy. Some
dealt with reported fighting on both
sides of the border. One said u regi
ment of American cavalry bail been
annihilated. Department officials liuil
no reports on which such statements
could have been founded.
Only meager news bulletins from
the troops In Mexico lire expeetbd.
While four correspondents of press as
sociations have been given credentials
to accompany General Pershing's com
mand, they will In* under strict cen
sorship. Regulations of the war de
partment under which they were des
ignated, give the commander control
over the information sent back. Noth
ing that could be of value to the en
emy will be permitted to pass over
whatever line of communication Gen
eral Pershing keeps open.
Such messages as are relayed will
lie brief. At most the expedition will
luive only field radio sets to keep In
touch with the border and official re
ports will clog this means of trans
mitting news. The American people
probably will hear of the chase and
of the battle with the bandits if there
is one, in terse official mossages from
General Pershing and through the
sifting of the rumors that reach tile
American side through Mexican
sources.
The announcement of General Kun
ston that the chase was on. disposed
of rumors that were particularly per
sistent throughout the day that a tem
porary halt had been called to permit
the Carranza troops to carry out their
own plans to capture Villa before tile
American soldiers took up the task.
At the state department It was said
positively that no request from Gen
eral Carranza for such a delay had
been received. Neither had any re
joinder come to the reply sent to Gen
eral Carranza Monday accepting his
proposal for a reciprocal agreement ou
the border.
Secretary Lansing's note clearly
stated the position of the United
States that the agreement for pursuit
of bandits was in force with its ae
