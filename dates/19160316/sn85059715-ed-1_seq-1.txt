EL PASO, March 16.?New nnd!
powerful army units are rapidly)
forming today along the Mexican bor-!
ilcr to 1111 tho gaps left Wednesday
when the first expeditionary army entered
Mexico.
In El Puso, Brigadier General
George Bell, Jr., moving In here on
tho heel? of Brigadier General J. J. |
Pershing, who led the first force Into
Mexico, was buoy gathorlng a new or-j
giinlzatlon and attending to tho supIply
problem and communications for
morn than 4.000 men, who Thursday
Were out on a virtual desert, rapidly
getting farther from their buaos.
Tho Twenty-third Infantry from
Galveston, was pitching Its tents at(
Fort BIHh here. At Columbus, N.
M? the Eleventh cavalry from Fort
Oglethorpe, arriving during the night,!
was ready to move In after the first
army, but It was not known here
when tho Eleventh would go, or In
which direction.
I'nlumbus was today the Immediate
base for Brlgc.dier General Pershing's!
army.
( V AMOCIATID rrntl
EL PASO, M..iCh 16.?The American
expeditionary force which has
started to capture Pajncho Villa alive
or dead had pctitrntod about ten miles
Into Mexico, according to most reliable
reports received here today.
Tho military eensomhln which has
been tightening its grip on the bor-,
tier for some days, permitted practically
nothing but rumors to escape
but it whs Talrly well established that
the advance corps of the American
expedition had camped last night ill ,
the heart of the desert, which lies between
the point of entry uml tha foothills
of the Sierra Madras, the vast
S| range of mountains in the fastneesI
^ ps of which Villa Is believed to have '
II taken refuge.
Hut the interest of the border in
thrt American advance was practically
overshadowed by the question us to
ho<" the presence of the soldiers of
the United States on Mexican terri
lory would be taken by the Curranza
military ofllclals and Hollders.
(lenerul Calles, the military governor
of Sonora, was the "man of the |
hour." His troops variously estimated
at from 12.00U to 20,0t)u men ,
garrisoned the frontier town and the
immediate Interior of the section Into ,
which the American soldiers had en
tered. For days reports and rumors '
B Ihnt f?nlln?'? Irnnnt ivnrft dlnaffeptpd .
I and bitterly resented the pursuit of
Villa by American soldiers have i
Hooded this region. The definite an-'
nouncctncnt lhat the Stars and
Stripes had been carried over the in-,
terimttonal lino Increased tlje rupiors j
nnd reports to a deluge out of which
t wan almost Impossible to pick what- .
over grounds of truth might exist. (
There seemed no question -that a '
considerable portion of the Mexican!
soldiers and Chilians in the north of ;
the republic were bitterly hostile to
the action of the United States. The .
higher civil nnd military authorities I
of (ho Cnrranza government showed
every desire to prevent friction, but i
it remains doubtful whether they can '
control the masses of the population!
In the very northern district, who are
becoming very restless, due to the i
sedulous propaganda against Amerl-'
cans which Is being carried on among
them from unknown sources. - Carranza
and Ojlnaga are the storm centers.

QUIET NIGHT IS SPESIT
BY TROOPS IN CAMP
COLUMnus!"\*M?.'vla'mall to El j
Paso. March 16.?The Aniorlcan ex
pedltlon which entered Mexico yester-;
B day spent an uneventful night camp-j
ed but a short distance afcross the
H American line.
iBrJgadlcr General John J. Pershing,
commander of the expedition, accora
panled the force us far as the border
H and then returned and with another'
part of the troopB entered Mexico to i
the (lank of the main army.
Despite rigid censorship, which
H closed all telephone and telegraph
wires to military movements, it bcB
came known that tho number which .
entered Mexico is about 5,000.
H Aeroplanes and motor trucks are
be 1 loved to have passed with the exH
peditlou.
Flying conditions owing to the
clearness of the atmosphere, are ideal.
I When General Pershing gave tho
order to march at 10 o'clock Wcdnes-1
day morning the soldiers swept forH
ward with a shout.
Cowboys off tho ranches enrolled as
scouts and cavalry led the way. Two i
infantry roglmonts, some field artillery j
H and a wagon train followed. - i
Colonel Slocumb met Colonel Da- i
vila, of tho Mexican forces, who prom- .
tsed that no resistance would be made i
to crossing the border. The entire (
B Mexican population In Palomas, sol- i
dlers and civilians, with one oxcep
tlon, cleared a^ay when the Ameri*
cans passed through the town. .
