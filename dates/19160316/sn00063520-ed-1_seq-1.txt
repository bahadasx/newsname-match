store room very much by some new
paint and kalsomlne.
The time has about arrived for the
general cleaning of the streets, also
the alleys and back yards.
It is also about time for gardening
to start and there should be another
special effort this spring to have trees
aud shrubs planted throughout the
residence portion of the city. A few
trees aud bushes add much to the
appearance of a home aud this Is es
pecially true in this section, so re

Thousands of rose bushes aud trees
have been planted the last few years
aud there is still room for many
more.

Superintendent Stevennon, of the
Short Line, was here lant week, lie
made a trip over the branch to look
over the road. Near Brogan the

and there waa some dsnger from the
Bully creek waters.
Later he went to the line down the
Snake from Huntington to make an
inspection.
Mr. Stevennon said the traffic over
the line at this time Is good, owing
to the Canal being closed, but rail
road circles are much concerned ov
er the labor situation, because the
employes of all the roads of the t "nit -od
Stated have voted for a big ln
crease In wages which may lead to a
national strike on It Is simply impos-
slble for the roads to increase wages

;
'. FnllaaiMIJ work toward the long
talked of Sumpter Valley railroad
branch to the Hums country, will be
; taken aa soon an the going oft' of the
nnow makes railroad operation ponnl-
ble.
The first step will be the construc
tion of 60 miles of railroad south
from Dixie Summit.
U. ('. Kccles, president of the rail
road, was in the city Tuesday, and
following his departure for Ogden,
It developed that surveyors will he
sent out to work from the top of the
Dixie divide, to aet stakes for the
proponed extennlnn, as soon as the
ground Is clear.
The dnte at which roadbed con-
structlon will lommence, la uncer-
tain, depending on the time of year
at which the surrey Is finished, but
the work will start within a few
months.
The extension as it Is now planned,
alms primarily at one of the richest
timber belts lu Orcicon. located 60
miles from Dixie Summit In the south
east corner of Oram county, a part
of the old Military Itoad Land tlrant,
alternate sectlona being held by the
Balfour-Guthrie Co., of Portland, or
by Mihsldlary concerns.
The timber Is yellow pine, near the
northern line of Malheur county, und
wjll total one billion feet.
It Is understood that the Oregon
Lumber Co will figure In the deal,
In the way of securing cheap slump
age on the enormous pine tract.
