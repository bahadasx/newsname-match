National Dress-Up Week
Observed in Valley City
Plans have been under way in Valley
City for some time to^roperly con
duct the National Dress-up Week,
which will be observed in every up
todate city from the Atlantic to the
Pacific. Usually large and attractive
stocks of uptodate merchandise will
be displayed by the Valley City mer
chants, as well as in every other city
of prominence. Every man and wo
man is realizing the importance of,
better dress—not freakish dress—and
is welcoming the dress-up spirit at a
time when our community and our
whole country are enjoying prosperity
unheard of, and also when nature
brings forth the splendor of new spring
dress. Other seasons of the year are
beautiful, but the spring is the true
dress-up season, both for nature and
human beings, and this spring even
more than ever before is going to be
a great dress-up season for all the
people throughout this great land of
peace and plenty.

Prettiest Game of Season
Speaking of the Friday night game,
the Fargo Forum paid the Valley City
boys the following compliment:
Valley City's victory came largely
as a result of their clever passing and
excellent basket shooting. The
Barnes county boys staged by far the
prettiest passing game on a local
floor this season and their shooting
was well timed and accurate.
Cook and Coop, the Valley City for
ward and center, respectively, were the
stars of the game. Cook counted for
a total of six field baskets during the
game .while Coop annexed four baskets
and three free throws. Nelson at for
ward also figured well in the scoring,
getting three long counters. Somdahl
and Stenshoel, both guards, cornered
one basket each. The defensive play

Rumor Points to Fight
on Primary Election Law
Bismarck, 'March 14.—Notice of elec
tion for the North Dakota presidential
preference primary of March 21, pub
lished today, shows 27 democrats seek
national convention honors. At the
same time rumors were afloat that a
fight would be made against the law,
before the primary, alleging that the
law disfranchises persons desiring to
send to national conventions men
pledged to candidates not allowing
their names used on the primary bal
lots.
Lively interest is being shown in the
buying and selling of land in Barnes
county this spring. Big deals in dirt
are being announced in rapid succes
sion, and there is no question but that
the showing Barnes county made agri
culturally last season is bringing set
tlers here in large numbers.
The W. A. Green Land Company has
handled several deals quite recently,
and the people they are bringing to the
farms sold are practical farmers who
will help along with our rural prosper
ity by their industry and knowledge of
intensified farming.
Among the recent purchases of land
by this company are:
The Wm. Flory farm of 880 acres
near Oriska.
The W. L. Haskins farm of 640 acres
near Leal.
The H. A. Perrin farm of 160 acres
near Eckelson.
The Susan Ferguson farm of 160
acres north of Oriska.
The Hendricks farm of 320 acres
north of Tower City.
Conrad Hoff and family of nine chil
dren (some family) arrived Tuesday
morning and will be placed on the
Stillman farm. They came
from Norfolk, Neb.
W. O. Gleason and wife, from Jef
fries, Minn., are the new residents on
the Henry Detmers farm.
Wm. Boddey, from Platte Center,
Neb., takes 240 acres two and one-half
miles southeast of Oriska.
The aggregate of land sales in
Barnes county this season will be tre
mendous, and the bringing in of prac
tical and well-infomied farmers will
give our agricultural industries a big
impetus.

Lisbon, March 11.—Several obstac
les to the establishment of a packing
house plant in North Dakota have de
veloped, according to M. P. CaBey, of
this place, who is a member of the
committee appointed by the Equity so
ciety to investigate the feasibility of
the proposition and to determine the
location of the plant.
One of these is a discovery that the
freight rates on packing house com
modities are prohibitive and that the
packing plant could not hope to sur
vive until an adjustment was reached.
This is not the fault of the rail
roads particularly, for the rates apply
in general on many undeveloped in
dustries" in North Dakota. In making
rates for the state the roads listed
the same lines of industries as found
elsewhere. For years the tariffs hava
not been changed because the state
had no packing plants and the ques
tion was never made an issue.
But with the proposed establish
ment of the packing house the mat
ter of rates is vital and must be de
termined before the plan is started.
Investigation of the factory prouo
sition indicates that while a plant for
plant to handle cattle would ever pay
because of the difficulty in disposing
of the by-products. The location of
the plant will be determined in about
90 days.
Farmers' Special Had

Minneapolis, March 10.—There were

The farmers arrived from different
points in southern {Minnesota, where
they have disposed of their farms in
order to settle in North Dakota.
Their household goods fill 20 freight
cars. A special train will be run over
the Soo line to Ryder to which will be
attached a tourist combination diner
