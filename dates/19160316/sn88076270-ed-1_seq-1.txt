Special District
Williams county has a great and
growing asset in her schools. Un
usually fortunate in supervision for
years past as well as at present they
have forged to the front ranks among
the schools of the state and the
Northwest. The school news of the
present week is the best evidence for
the proof of these statements.
On the Attendance Records and
Work Done
Williams County receives $1026.50
as premiums from the state for its
classified schools. This amount has
been apportioned as follows:
Tioga, first class consolidated..$140.00
Dist. No. 78, Brooklyn consoli
dated 105.00
Dist No. 5, Buford consolidated 105.00
First Class Rural
Dist. No. 79, school No. 1 $61.50
Bonetraill Dist. No. 35, school
No. 1 61.50
Hazel District No. 4, school No.

Tande District No. 7, school No.

Hartland Dist. No. 63, school

Spring Coulee Dist. No. 77,
school No. 1 41.00
Tande Dist. No. 7, schools No.
1, 3, 5, each 41.00
Wildrose Dist. No. 34, schools
No. 2 and 3, each 41.00
This is a remarkable showing and
there ought to be a special effort
made says the superintendent to keep
up the attendance during the spring
months in order that these same
schools and others may classify this
year, as it was the poor attendance
which kept many other schools from
classifying last year. Where possible
an extra month should be held to
make up for the time lost in January
on account of severe weather.

Burn Mortgage At
Annual Banquet
Members of the M. E. church and
their invited guests passed a most de
lightful evening at the banquet and
program given in the Odd Fellows
hall last night. Rev. Hollett, former
pastor of the church was the guest
of honor and his remarks were enjoy

and songs was carried out. At the
conclusion of the program the!
Trustees
of the church burned the mortgage
which had been on the property for a
number of years and thus celebrated
the fact that their church was free
from debt.
Believes Mexicans
Will Rally to Villa
Washington, March 13.—Senator
Borah, republican, urged the senate
to drop all other legislation and im
mediately consider a national pre
paredness program in view of the con
quences that might arise from the de
cision to pursue Villa in Mexico.
Chairman Chamberlain of the mili
tary committee told the senate that in
his opinion the United States army
did not have enough soldiers to cope
with Mexico or enough equipment.
He added he would not be surprised
to see all Mexicans rally around Villa.

"Force Intervention" Held To Be
Villa's Aim
El Paso, March 13.—In spite of offi
cial denials, reports are persistant
here that American cavalry on the
Arizona side had gathered for imme
diate crossing of the Mexican bor
der and that they might go across
at any moment.
San Antonio, March 13.—No move
ment of the expeditionary forces
which will search for Villa is probable
today, Funston announced. The gen
eral said that preparations for the ex
pedition were going right ahead, de
spite Carranza's notification to the
Washington government that he
would not consent to American troops
entering Mexico unless Carranza
troops were allowed to enter the Uni
ted States.
It was officially announced that
Brigadier General John J. Pershing
will command the expeditionary
forces. Funston said he had received
no notification from Washington to
hold back the expedition while nego
tiations were completed with Car
ranza.
Funston said that announcement of
the expedition's actual start into Mex
ico probably would come from Persh
ing to whom would be left the deci
sion as to the exact hour for setting
the government afoot. A shortage of
rolling stock, Funston said, was hin
dering the concentration of cavalry at
the base of operations and this was
one reason why a movement today
was unlikely. The fault, he said,
rested with the railroads west of El
Paso.
"We have been transporting men in
boxcars," he said. "If this had been
merely an infantry expedition we
could have been in Mexico on Villa's
very heels," Funston continued, "but
this is largely a cavalry movement
and that is why there has been de
lay."
Light was thrown on the size of the
expeditionary force by Funston, who
also said: "When this movement is
completed there will be only six or
eight regiments left in the United
States other than those troops sta
tioned along the border for patrol
duty."
Columbus an Armed Camp
El Paso, March 13.—Daylight re
vealed the beginning of the expedi
tionary force which the United States
is gathering along the border west of
here for the pursuit of Villa. Six
mountain guns were unloaded during
the night and are in readiness at Co
lumbus, the scene of Villa's raid. This
is the first armed camp to develop evi
dences that it has been selected as one
of the starting points for the pursuit
column.
Fifty-seven carloads of battery
mules and transport animals also ar
rived and there was evidence that two
more guns were coming. Eleven hun
dred men were in camp this morning.
About 200 miles west of here troop
trains were reported passing various
points during the night, as the result
of orders released Friday by the war
department. What points except Co
lumbus might be used to assemble the
pursuit columns has not developed but
considerable activity is noted on the
Arizona border near Nogales and also
near a small Mexican settlement call
ed San Bernardino.
In that region several troops of
cavalry are reported in readiness for
action. A column entering Mexico
from one of these Arizona border
points would have a fairly direct
route to the mountain passes in So
nora, through which apprehension has
been expressed that Villa might es
cape from the Chihuahua territory
into which he has retreated.
Nog-ales reported that a few cannon
had been discovered in the Mexican
hills facing the American boundary
near there, but elsewhere along the
line where American troops are gath
ering there are no signs of disquiet
ing activity reported along the Mexi
can side.
Reports here that army officers at
Columbus were puzzled at the atti
tude of Carranza troops a few miles
across the boundary were flatly denied
upon investigation. Army informa
tion is that 2,500 Carranza troops had
gathered at Palomas, about 12 miles

LAST BIG FARMERS' MEET
NET MONDAY, MARCH 20
Great Northern Cooperating With Williston Com
mercial Club Will Bring Corps of Well
Known Speakers Large Attendance of
Farmers Expected.
The Great Northern Railway through it's well organized ag
ricultural extension department is holding farmers' meetings at
points along its lines to advance the work for better and more
diversified farming. Where ever there is opportunity the Great
Northern people cooperate with local organizations. The offer of
Prof. F. R. Crane, head of the G. N. Agricultural Department, to
hold a meeting in Williston met with immediate acceptance by the
Commercial Club directors who have arranged for the meeting
and thoroughly advertised it.
CLUBS AND ALL FARMERS INVITED
Monday, March 20, Odd Fellows hall, 1:30 P. M., are the day,
place and hour. Over 200 invitations have been mailed to Farm
ers clubs and individual farmers. All farmers within reach of the
city are invited and urged to attend this meeting. Important
farm subjects will be discussed from a practical stand point.
It will be very much to the interest of the county to sustain
its well earned reputation for progressiveness in agriculture on
this occasion which will probably be the last big farmers meeting
of the winter season.
Among the agricultural leaders who will be present are Prof.
Shaw and Prof. Crane of the Great Northern, H. R. Smith, live
stock expert, E. A. Wilson, secretary of the American Milking
Shorthorn Breeders Association. Come and bring your neighbor.
If You Don't Like The
Uncle Sam Suggests Course of Action
Stars in Old Glory
The average AMERICAN, hyphenated, unhyphen
ated or dehyphenated, of the great, liberty loving West,
has plenty of sentiment in his makeup but he seldom
takes time to express it in even single jointed prose to
say nothing of rhyme and music, but when someone
voices that sentiment Mr. American takes time to listen
and give his approval.
If the sentiment happens to be patriotic, and timely,
said approval can often be heard by the naked ear for
some distance. The applause heard issuing from a local
drug store, at various times, during the past week, was
occasioned by the playing, on a "singing" machine, of the
latest, popular song hit copied below:
DON'T BITE THE HAND THAT'S FEEDING YOU
Victor Record
Words by Thomas Hoier Music by Jimmie Morgan
Last night as I lay asleeping,
A wonderful dream came to me
I saw Uncle Sammy weeping,
For his children over the sea.
They had come to him friendless and starving,
When from tyrant's oppression they fled,
But now they abuse and revile him,
Till at last njust anger he says:
"If you don't like your Uncle Sammy,
Then go back to your home o'er the sea
To the land from where you came,
What ever be it's name,
But don't be ungrateful to me.
"If you don't like the stars in Old Glory,
If you don't like the red, white and blue,
Then don't act like the cur in the story
Don't bite the hand that's feeding you.
"You recall the day that you landed,
How I welcomed you to my shore
When you came here empty handed,
And allegiance forever you swore,
I gathered you close to my bosom,
Of food and clothes you got both
So, when in trouble, I need you,

WILLISTON HORSE TO LANGDON
FROM BURDICK FARM
Horsemen are getting the habit of

sires to head their herds. This week

DEER IN DISTRESS
MAN THEIR FRIEND
WATER AND ICE TRAP DENIZENS
OF WOODED FLATS—DEER
HELPLESS ON SMOOTH ICE
TWELVE ARE RESCUED AND
BROUGHT TO WILLISTON
Difficult Task of Getting Perishing
Animals To Land Aided by
Game Wardens
The peculiar conditions brought
about by the flood and the quick
freeze mean distress and peril to
many of the creatures of the river
low lands. A traveler from Fairview,
Mont., located in the valley of the
Yellowstone, tells of the strange sight
of two deer, a coyote and a jack rab
bit huddled together on a straw
stack, the yellow flood, thinly ice
coated all about them.
The deer are probably the greatest
sufferers. Wary and instinct gifted
as they are, the treacherous waters
have proven in many instances too
much for them. Deer in North Da
kota are protected by law until 1920
but man made laws are not heeded
by the Missouri river.
"Wild as a deer" but a few days
ago, ready to flee with lightning
swiftness from the sight of man, it
was indeed a strange sight to see the
unhappy white tails comparatively
tame, submissive to the hands of men.
Baffled, discouraged and weakened,
some of them seemed almost to wel
come the coming of their rescuers.
Others, retaining some strength put
forth valient but vain efforts to es
cape from their supposed enemies.
Ice Their Undoing
The rapid thaw of last week sent
torrents of water into the Missouri
putting it over its banks and break
ing up it's still solid ice which gorged
in places causing the floods to spread
wider. By the time the big water had
reached here March had changed it's
mind and the temperature dropped
almost to zero causing the slack wa
ter on the flats to freeze over quickly.
The deer sought the higher spots and
the water backed around them—and
then froze, smooth as glass. The
trapped victims could not wade or
swim against the thin sharp coat and
after it became thick and strong they
could not stand up on it with their
small, smooth hoofs. In many in
stances they had no spots of earth
left and lay prostrate on the ice,
numb with cold. This situation does
not apply to all the deer in the bot
toms for many have been seen on the
hills. Near the Sharpe ranch, three
miles east of town it is reported that
18 were counted.
Rescue Work Bepins
Tuesday, Bert Scace and his neigh
bor Mr. Dalton, on their way in from
their farms, discovered a buck on the
ice near the Great Northern track
about two miles west of town. They
threw a rope over it's neck and got
it to solid ground. It had been
through a wire fence and was badly
wounded but they got it to town. It
was very weak and thick coats of ice
were frozen on it's sides from having
lain in the freezing water.
Wednesday a party of over twenty
went on hand cars to a point west of
Todd siding where train men report
ed having sighted about a dozen deer
a mile or more from the railroad. The
animals were there but the ice was
still thin and the water beneath both
deep and chilly. Several took invol
untary baths. W. S. Davidson and
E. W. Blaisdell were the first to suc
cessfully venture the passage and
reach the deer. But the best that
could be done was to get two off the
ice. These were brought to town in
the caboose of a passing work train.
Game Warden Comes
State Game Warden E. B. Mc
Cutcheon having been notified came
to Williston from Minot on No. 1
this morning bringing a dputy from
Stanley. The warden, assisted by
Captain Bailey, organized a force to
complete the work of rescue. Tho
ice had frozen thicker during the
night and after a strenuous day the
whole lot, so far as could be discov
ered, were brought to Williston.
In all, an even dozen, nine bucks
and three does, have been brought to
town, but one, the first brought in,
died of it's wire cuts and the ex
posure. Aside from their rough ex
perience of the past few days, they
are in fine condition and show no ef
fects of the severe winter.
Will Be Kept and Protected
The game warden thoroughly ap
proves of the deer being kept, cared

BOARD OF EDUCATION FINDS
ANOTHER BUILDING IS PRAC

ENROLLMENT ALMOST AT
THE ONE THOUSAND MARK
Call Election For March 31—Bonda
For $21,000 Proposed—Open
Letter From Board
Nine hundred and sixty-six pupils
enrolled—191 in the Senior high
school and 135 in the Junior high
school, a total greater than the en
rollment of any high school in the
state, with three exceptions—extra
grade rooms for several of the grades
an absolute necessity—all available
space now occupied—these are some
of the facts of the situation that con
fronts the board of education and has
persuaded them that the construction
of another building is the most satis
factory as well as the most business
like course to follow.
Accordingly a special election has
been called, notice of which will be
found in another column, for Friday,
March 31, to vote on the question of
bonds in the sum of $21,000.
The proposed building would be
placed at the south side of the orig
inal central building and would be
quite similar to the new building at
the north side, but probably slightly
larger. In an open letter, printed be
low, the board explains some of the
features of the problem before them*
An Open Letter
At their regular meeting of Tues
day night, the Board of Education
passed a resolution favoring the erec
tion of an additional school building
and calling for a special election on
March 31 for the issuance of bonds
in the sum of twenty one thousands
dollars.
Perhaps nowhere else in Williston
is the city's growth and development:
more in evidence than in the public
schools.
But a comparatively few years ago
the Central School was ample for the
accomodation of the enrollment then,
came the need for the West Lawn
school which would apparently satis
fy all demands for many years but
shortly there was required also the
Annex, now the home of the Junior
High school and it was just tw»
years ago that the new High School*
building was first occupied. And now
this continued growth demands an
other building.
All rooms in West Lawn school are

Citizens Responding'
To Directors' Letter
The officers and directors of the
Commercial Club are elated over the
numerous and prompt responses al
ready received to the letter and list
of questions sent to over 400 citizens
as a means of gathering the con
sensus of opinion on the proper
course for the club to pursue during
the present year. Yesterday Presi
dent Jackson said: "The question
lists are already coming back in grat
ifying numbers. The plan ef inquiry
looks like a big success and likely to
prove of far greater value to us at
this time, in helping to shape our pro
gram of work than a public meeting
could have been. Please say that we
hope every blank will come back fully
filled out. And say that we would'
like to have them all in by next Mon
day."
The letter and list of 16 questions
was published in the last issue of the
Graphic. Since then they have been»
mailed to between 400 and 500 people^
and any who fail to receive them
through the post office can secure:
copies at the drug stores.
Seek Efficiency
The directors are doing their level*
best to get started right and all they
ask of the citizen body, at present, is
to aid them by counsel. The directors
are earnestly desirous of making the
Commercial Club EFFICIENT for
the purposes for which it is designed.
The directors in laying out the prin
cipal work of the year wish to con
centrate effort on the things the citi
zens at large consider most important.
If every one who receives a letter will
contribute 30 minutes thought to the
cause of a better Williston, and indi
