Testing seed corn lias paid at the
rate of $6.85 an hour if com is
worth 50 cents a bushel, according
to results obtained during five
years at the Ohio Experiment
Station and reported by.C. G. "Wil
liams in the March Monthly JJulle
tin of tho Station. Durirfg the five
years an average increase of 4.11
bushels per acre has been made by
testing tho corn before it is plant
ed. In 1912 this increase was 9.27
bushels. v
Tests made at the Station show
that the corn crop of 1915 hud
more moisture in it than any other
crop tested. It had nearly 10 per
cent more moisture than the crop
of 1912, which was an unusually
wet season. For this reason Mr.
"Williams advises that all seed
corn be tested this spring because
of the excessive rainfall of last
summer and fall.
In testing seed corn six kernels
taken from different parts of each
ear arc kept moist for about a
week in germination boxes at a
temperature of 50 to 75 degrees.
The ears are numbered to corres
pond to the squares in the tester,
and in this way all ears may be
rejected that have any kernels
which do not sprout. Purther
information regarding such test
ers may be obtained from the
Experiment Station, "Wooster, O. .

Laymen and preachers told the
Sunday Evening club what was
the matter with the church Sun
day night in First Congregational
Church, says the Blade.
The Sunday schools are a joke
the way they are conducted now,
said E. S. Maddock.
"Think what would become of
our public schools if they were de
pendent upon the contributions of
the pupils," he said. "There would
be very little educating done.
State laws prohibit the teaching of
religion in the public schools and
the only place to get it is in the
church.
"The church should provide a
dncont Sundav school where re
ligion could be taught. There are
plenty of good teachers who could
teach the Bible if we got our Sun
day schools down to a business
basis."
Financial ills of the church also
were discussed at length by Mr.
Maddock. He declared the church
es are known as beggars because
they always arc asking for some
thing. "Everyone hates a beggar," he
declared. "That is why our
churches are disliked.
"There are just two courses
open for the churches today. They
must either cut their expenses to
meet their income or increase their
income to meet the expenses. This
thing of an annual deficit of
churches is a joke among business
men. The church should and could
be conducted on a sound business
basis just like any other establish
ment. ""We should have a fund for ad-
vertising. Churches need publicity
as wel1 as un' other kind o Lnsi"
." Get it and pay for it. There
aru a certni.u "lber of members
in every church who do not attend
services. Tliere siiouiu ue a lunu
for a form of publicity which
would take the pastor's message
to them."
DEATH OP WM. WAGONER.
On Saturday evening, March 11,
191G, Mr. "William "Wagoner passed
away at his home in Stony Ridge.
Funeral services "were held at the
M. E. Church, at Stony Ridge,
with interment at Luekey.
A Specific Against Colds.
The nearest thing to a specific
against colds is a sleeping porch or
open bed room and a cold sponge bath
every morning when you first get up.
Even then you will occasionally take
a cold, especially when colds are epi
demic, and when you do you will find
Chamberlain's Cough Remedy a great
help in enabling you to get rid of it.
Try it. For sale by all dealers.

met on the, corner. "Freight
depot," said the boy. "Say, mis

Ave don't have no freight depot in
Perrysburg." "Well, then, my
boy, where does the C. II. & D. R.

bring to town?" was the question.
"Oh, well, you go down to the
track and look for an old, battered
half rotten box ear on the ground
at the side of the track and that's
all we have in this town for a
freight depot." And say, mister,
if you can't find the freight depot,
just hunt for the "Union Passen-
ger btation and then it you look ,
close you'll find the freight depot
on the same side of the track. And
say, mister, do you know why we
call it the Union passenger sta
tion? Well, it's 'cause both ends
are so close together. Good-bye,

NEW CHURCH DESTROYED,
The new Evangelical church at
Lindsay, Ohio, just completed at a
cost of $25,000 was destroyed by
fire on Sunday morning last. The
old church which had been moved
to the rear of the new building
and used while the new edifice
was in course of erection, was to
have been the scene of farewell
services on Sunday, but when the
sexton went to the church he dis
covered the old building on fire.
Flames communicated with the new
building and both were completely
destroyed. Insurance on new build
ing was $15,000.00.

XHBi OLDEST HANK IN WOOD COUNTY ,
IIow to spray for all the diseases
which affect apple, peach, pear,
plum, cherry and quince trees is
treated in a, bulletin which will be
sent free to any one who sends
their name and address to the Ex
tension Dept., Ohio State Uni
versity, Columbus. The bulletin
also takes up the treatment of tho
insect enemies of trees such as the
codling moth, San Jose scale,
canker worm, and wooly aphis.
Outlines for spraying schedules
with a list of spraying materials
and how they can be home-mixed
are also given.
This is the month for the farmer
to begin spreading manure, the
most valuable fertilizing material
in Ohio. When the nightly freezes
harden the ground, the spreader
can be used to advantage in the
forenoon with little damage to the
fields. Manure applied to the
clover sod to be turned down later
in ,tho spring, will produce an
average return of $4.G9 per ton
according to experiments at the
Iowa Experiment Station. The
Mime treatment for the meadows
left for hay will produce striking
result. With clover, manure has
been found to return $3.76 per ton,
much more than any other treat
ment. Basing his predictions on corn
tests made at agricultural exten
sion schools over Ohio during the
past winter, "W. E. Ilanger, crop
specialist of Ohio State University
states that the majority of seed
corn will germinate poorly due to
the high moisture content. To test
seed com easily and effectively
Mr. Ilanger advises farmers to
use the rag doll method. Take a
strip of muslin 10 inches wide and
about 5 feet long and lay it off in
2-inch squares with a margin along
each side. The squares can be
marked off with a lead pencil.
Place the strip upon a table, with
in each square put 6 grains from
each ear tested and mark each ear
according to its test square. Then
on the marked strip place a plain
piece of muslin wetting it down so
that all the grains of corn are cov
ered and held in place with this
cover. Roll both of the strips to
gether and immerse the whole in
