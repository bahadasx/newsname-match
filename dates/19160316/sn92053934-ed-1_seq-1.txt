CARRANZISTAS TO AID
Great Numbers of Men of
De Facto Government
Join Americans.
San Antonio, Texas, March 16. The
first report from Brigadier General
Pershing, commanding the expedition
ary forces into Mexico, to Major Gen
eral Funston, stating that all was go
ing well, was received at Fort Sam
Houston this morning. The report
dealt with the strength of General
Pershing's command, the disposition i
of the various units and the officers,
the distances of the day's march and
the movements of the Carranza troops.
All these matters come under the
censorship, however, and were not
given out.
General Funston today arranged for
a direct government wire to Columbus,
X. M. At the same time it was an
nounced that General Pershing might
make frequent trips between the field
forces and Columbus. In this way the
commander of the expeditionary forces
can keep in close touch with the head
of the southern department.
El Paso, March 16. The American
expeditionary force which has started
to capture PanchoVilla "dead or
alive," and penetrated about ten miles
into Mexico, according to the most re
liable reports received here today.
The military censorship, which has
been tightening its grip on the bordei
for some days permitted nothing ex
cept rumors to escape but it was fair
ly well established that the advance
corps of the American expedition had
camped last night in the heart of the
desert which lies between the point of
entry and the foothills of the Sierra
Madres, the vast range of mountains
in the fastnesses of wLich Villa is be
lieved to have taken refuge.
"Watch Effect of Invasion.
But the interest of the border in the
American advance was overshadowed
by the question as to how the presence
of the soldiers of the United States on
Mexican soil would be taken by the
troops of Carranza. General Calles,
the military governor of Sonora, was
the "man of the hour." His troops,
variously estimated at from 12,000 to
20,000 men, garrisoned the frontier
towns and the immediate interior of
the section into which the American
soldiers had entered. For days reports
and rumors that Callas' troops were
disaffected and bitterly resented the
pursuit of Villa by American soldiers,
have flooded this region. The definite
announcement that the stars and
stripes had been carried over the In
ternational line by armed forces in
creased these rumors and reports to
a deluge out of which it was almost
impossible to pick whatever grains of
truth might exist.
There seemed no question that a
considerable portion of the Mexican
soldiers and civilians in the northern
part of the republic were bitterly hos
tile to the action of the United States.
The higher civil and military authori
ties of the Carranza government
showed tvery desire to prevent fric
tion but it remains doubtful whether
they can control the masses of the pop
ulation In the northern district who
are becoming very restless due to the
sedulous propaganda against Ameri
cans which is being carried on among
them from unknown sources.
Wild Rumors Afloat.
Cananea and OJinaga are the storm
enters. It was reported today from
Douglas that 500 picked men had been
rushed to the former town by General
Calles following alarming accounts of
'he situation there which reached him.
Ojinaga has been the target of the
most sensational rumors for two days.

Dutch Litter
Tubantia Is
Lost at Sea
London, March 16, (4:5? p. ni.)
A wireless dispatch sent from
Tobantia last night as given by
Renter's correspondent at Ymni
den, Holland, says the steamship
was torpedoed. The correspond
ent asserts there were Americans
on board.
The wireless message, which
was signed "First Wireless Oper
ator," was received last night at
Tmuiden by way of Schcveningcn,
Holland, and is qnotcd as follows:
"Tubantia torpedoed and lost.
Am now leaving ship with captain.
Don't worry."
Among the passengers, Renter's
correspondent says, were "some
Americans and German women."
"It is now certain that the Tuban
tia was torpedoTtl without warning,"
telegraphs the Amsterdam corres
pondent of the Central News. "There
were three Americans on board. They
were Richard Schillings, an Ameri
can consul; Emma Schilling and Car
men Schilling."
London, March 16, (11:10 a. m.) A
Reuter dispatch from the Hook of Hol
land says that a wireless message has
been received there stating that the
large Dutch passenger steamship Tu
bantia, outward bound from Amster
dam to the River Plate, has been tor
pedoed and Is in a sinking condition
near the Noordhinder lightship. All
the passengers have been taken off on
boats.
The London agents of the steam
ship Tubantia which is owned by the
Holland Lloyd of Amsterdam, have
received a message saying the vessel
struck a mine and Is sinking. Another
dispatch says the Tubantia was tor
pedoed.
The steamship, which is of 15,000
tons gross, left Amsterdam yesterday
for Buenos Ayres with passengers and
a cargo. She was to have stopped at
Falmouth and peninsular ports, where
the majority of the passengers were to
have been taken aboard.
A life saving boat has left the Hook
of Holland to search, -fop, tka -sinking
vessel and Dutch torpedo boats are
leaving Flushing to hurry to the res
cue of the ship's passengers in the life
boats.
The Tubanita was built at Glasgow
in 1913 and is 540 feet long and 65
feet beam. She left Buenos Ayres on
February 4 for Amsterdam.
The Tubantia was still floating at
8:30 o'clock this morning. It is un
certain whether she was struck by a
mine or a torpedo.
A later Reuter dispatch from The
Hague says the Dutch ministry of ma
rine has received information that two
of the Tubantia's boats, with surviv
ors, have reached Noordhinder light
ship. The Dutch steamship Krakatau,
which is standing by, passed another
Dutch steamer which had many sur
vivors on board. A Swedish steamship
also is searching for survivors.
The London agents of the Tubantia
state that her crew numbered about
300. They have no information as to
the number of passengers who em
barked at Amsterdam.
The Tubantia carried a general car
go and mails.
A Reuter dispatch from Yniuiden
says that the Tubantia carried 42 first
class, 33 second class and 80 third
class passengers.
VILLA RUSHES Or!
BEFORE PURSUERS
Bandit General With FoUowers Pushes
on Put Mormon Colony, Ac
cording to Reports.
El Paso, Tex., March 16. General
Villa, since the pursuit of the Ameri
can army started, has apparently
passed beyond the American Mormon
colony, about Cases Grandes. Reliable
dispatches today indicated that these
500 Americans now are safe. These
dispatches gave credit also to the Car
ranza forces about Casas Grandes for
putting up a front which stopped Villa
from making his proposed raid on the
Americans.
Today's information Indicated strong
ly that the shifty bandit leader, with
his supply of swift horses, Is again on
the move. Information about the na
ture of his movements was closely
guarded from becoming public.
Casas Grandes is about 100 miles due
south of the point, where the column
of General Pershing entered Mexico,
yesterday.
Jury Disagrees on Fraud Case.
Danville, 111., March 16. After de
liberating more than 24 hours, a Jury
in the federal court which heard the
case against Dr. Logan Estes, of Mat
toon, and J. C. Miller, of N'eoga, 111.,
charged with mail frauds, failed to
agree. The Jury was discharged and
the case will be retried at the Septem
ber term of court. Both defendants
are at liberty on ball of $5,000 each.

Paris Statement.
QUIET BEFORE STORM
Believed That Some Signifi
cance May Be Attached
to Cessation.
Paris, March 16, (2:30 p. m.) There
has been no further infantry action to
the region north of Verdun, according
to announcement made by the French
war office this afternoon.
The bombardment has continued but
with varying intensity.
The text of the communication
reads:
"In Belgium French patrols have
been able to ascertain that the de
structive fire directed by our artillery
against the German forces at La
Plage, in the region of Nieuport, re
sulted in the complete destruction of
the German communicating trenches
and killed fi number of the enemy.
"In the the regions of Haudremont
and Damloup, our artillery has can
nonaded violently the country to the
west of Douaumont.
"In the Vosges to the south of Thur,
the Germans delivered an attack
against our positions near Burnhaupt
but were checked by our fire."
Berlin, March 16, (via London, 3:35
p. m.) A number of unsuccessful at
tacks have been made by the French
on the German lines south of St. Sou
plet, west of the Somme-Py road in
the Champagne- region; German army
headquarters announced today. The
Germans took two officers and 150
men prisoners and captured two ma
chine guns.

ment of today says that a hostile aero
plane was shot down at a point two
kilometres east of the Suez canal.
Teke Burnu, on the Gallipoli penin
sula, was shelled by hostile cruisers.
THE WAR
TODAY
One of the frequent panses,
which has characterized the Ger
man campaign for Verdun is again
In evidence.
On the entire western front ar
tillery exchanges are still in
progress, bnt the German crown
prince's army bas halted either
to rest or bring up reinforcements
for a continuance of the assault
on Yerdnn.'
Apparently there Is anticipation
on the part of the French that the
next German move may be made to
the southeast of the fortress in a
flanking operation, as the French
guns have been extremely active
along the heights of the Mense
overlooking the Woevre plain.
It is officlaly declared in Berlin
that the change in the head of the
ministry of marine, Involving the
retirement of Admiral von Tirpitz,
who is succeeded, by Admiral von
Capeile, signifies no change In the
German government's submarine
policy.
The Russian advance toward
the Mesopotamlan frontier is
rapid and they expect soon to be
In tonch with the British forces.
The Russians nre said to be with
in fifty miles of the last difficult
pass which will place them in the
rear of the Turkish Bagdad army
and their object is to cut the rail
road to the north, thereby prevent
ing the Turkish army from getting
supplies, and cooperate with the
British against Bagdad. The Rus
sians are making progress
against the Turks along the
Black sea const toward Trebl
zond. having captured a number
of officers and men and several
machine gnns. In Mesopotamia
the British have attacked an ad
vanced position of the Turks, bay

dispatch to the Exchange Telegraph
company says the municipal authori
ties in Germanyhave been instructed
to tafce a census of all neutral foreign
ers who have lived in each city for
more than five years. Male foreigners
who have lived uninterruptedly for
five years in Germany will be consid
ered as having lost their previous citi
zenship and will be regarded as Ger
mans and therefore liable to military
service. Thsse men will be enrolled in
the army and put to work in offices,
releasing men of the landstrum for
service on the fighting line. It is said
that there are 30,000 foreigners of
fighting age in Germany.

ted States on the recent stopping of

First Relief
in Sub Issue
"Washington, March 16. Emperor
William's determination not to pro
voke a break with the United States in
the new submarine campaign even
though it involves a factional contest
in the German reichstag, having al
ready brought about the downfall of
Grand Admiral von Tirpitz himself, is
indicated in today's Berlin dispatches.
The tone of these dispatches from
the German capital, although guard
ed and veiled, is taken here to prove
the supremacy of the emperor, Chan
cellor von Bethmann-Hollweg, For
eign Minister von Jagow and the ar
my, which has been opposing the
plan of Admiral von Tirpitz and the
navy party to carry the submarine
campaign to a merciless destruction
of all neutral shipping to all enemy
ports. Showing the decision of the
emperor and his supporters to re
ject a submarine policy practically
certain to bring about a break in re
lations with the United States, if not
actually war, the development is re
garded here as a potent augury for a
peaceful solution of the situation with
Germany. The passage of today's Ber
lin dispatches by the German censor
is regarded as showing the desire of
the German foreign office to reassure
the American people. It is believed
that the contest will result in prob
ably harsh attacks upon the United
States and the German government
itself by the Von Tirpitz element.
The general understanding is that it
was the emperor himself who decided
that every effort should be made to
retain the friendship of the United
! Qtataa clinrt rf a hpnrt nnln tr anv nrin-
ciples involving the honor of the Ger
man nation. The result was the re
jection of the proposed extension of
submarine warfare to affect neutral
nations. Von Tirpitz' retirement fol
lowed naturally the rejection of the
plans he had fathered.
The German government is reliably
represented as having no Intention
of departing from its announced pol
icy of regarding armed merchantmen
of the entente allies as warships. At
the same time it will shape its cam
paign so as to obviate all possibility
of trouble with the United States and
every effort will be exerted. It is said,
to avoid friction with neutrals gen
erally. ENGLISH MARRIED

London, March 16, (3 p. m.) Pre
mier Asqulth and the earl of Derby

MEN VIOLENT IN
CHICAGO STRIKE
Rioting and Arrests Mark Proceedings
of Day's Events About Corn Pro
ducts Factory.
Chicago, March 16. Rioting and the
arrest of three strikers on a charge of
disorderly conduct followed the re
sumption of operations today at the
plant of the "Corn. Products Refining
company at Argo, a suburb. When
work at the plant was resumed for the
first time since the men went on a
strike last Monday for an Increase of
wages from 17 to 25 cents an hour,
the former employes and sympathizers
gathered in groups outside the build
ings and several threw stones.
F. L. Jeffries, superintendent of the
plant addressed the strikers, offering
to take them back but said the demand
for increased wages would not be
granted. The offer was greeted by
hisses. i
VESSEL ESCAPES
FROM MARINE
French liner With 29 Americans
Aboard Barely Escapes Disaster
off Algerian Coast.
New York, March 16. The French
steamer Patria of the Fabre line, car
rying among her passengers 29 Amer
icans including an American consul,
was attacked without warning by a
submarine off the Algerian coast on
March 1, Captain Pierre Deschelles
announced today upon the arrival of
the ship from Mediterranean ports. A
torpedo directed at the Patria missed
the ship by about thirty feet.
Olney Arnold, American consul gen
eral at Cairo, was a passenger on the
ship from Naples to Lisbon. He told
Captain Deschelles that he would for
ward a-full report of the attack to the
United States government. Mr. Arn
old, who was returning home, died at
Lisbon the day after his arrival there.
He was on the verge or a nervous
breakdown at the time of his depart
ure from Cairo.
TWO SPORT RULE IS
ADOPTED BY SCHOOL
Chicago, March 17. Northwestern
through the action of its faculty yes
terday adopted a two-sport rule. Here
after students will be permitted to
compete in only two branches of major
sport. The passage of the rule was
the result of an agitation In favor of
its adoption as a general law of the
conference, but when submitted to a
vote among the nine universities last
year it failed of passage and was left
to individual action by the several
schools.
It was believed among the follow
ers of college athletics here that
Northwestern will stand practically
alone in the adoption of the rule.

Follows on Heels of General
Pershing in Making New
Preparations.
1 Paso, March 16. It was stat
ed at the headquarters of Gen
eral Gavira, Carranza command
er at Juarez, today, that no infor
mation has been received of any
Carranza troops having joined the
American expedition. General
Bertani, who was reported to have

here last night with 75 men from
Guzman.
El Paso, Texas, March 16. New and
powerful army units were rapidly
forming today along the Mexican bor
der to fill the gaps left yesterday when
the first expeditionary army entered
Mexico from two points on the New
Mexican line. In El Paso, Brigadier
General George Bell, Jr., moving in
here on the heels of Brigadier General
J. J. Pershing, who led the first force
into Mexico, was busy gathering a new
organization and attending to the sup
ply problem, the food, water and com
munications for more than 4,000 men.
who today were out on a virtual des
ert rapidly getting farther from their
bases.
The 23rd Infantry from Galveston.
was pitching Its tenta at Fort Bliss
here. At Columbus, N. M., the 11th
cavalry from Fort Oglethorpe, arriv
ing during the night, was ready to
move in after the first army, but it was
not known here when the 11th would
go or in whic direction. Columbus
was today the immediate base for
Brigadier General Pershing's army.
Courier's Under Censor Too.
Reports of interesting incidents of
yesterday as the dust powdered Amer
ican columns went over the interna
tional line reached here today via
couriers. For the most part these
couriers showed a desire to cooperate
with the request of the military con
sors that they should not reveal any
thing of military importance.
From a hill overlooking the six
square miles where the army was still
encamped at 11 o'clock yesterday fore
noon the military organization ap
peared to civilian spectators like a
vast confused swarm of men and
horses, grey cannon, wagons, mule
teams and ambulances. But at 11:40
a. m. when the word was given to form
for the pursuit of Villa, the apparent
confusion disappeared. In a very few
minutes each organization of cavalry,
infantry and artillery, ambulances,
signal corps and the cook's wagons,
grouped and dovetailed into a rapidly
lengthening column. At the van the
red and white guidons of the 13th cav
alry snapped In the breeze. These cav
alrymen included the troopers vho a
week ago today, outnumbered, five to
one, drove Villa back into Mexico from
Columbus.
Behind the 13th marched the com
pact, brown columns of the 6th and
the 16th Infantry. Next, at a slow trot,
a field battery swung into line and
then dropped to a slow pace behind
the infantry "doughboys" the deadly
machine guns, packed in commercial
looking bundles on mules, attracted
scarcely a look from unitiated civilian
spectators. Supply trains and ambu
lances rolled in a long line bringing
up the rear. Vast dust clouds swept
up from the line of march, at times
obscuring the troops.
Glad of the Chance.
The feeling among the me seemed
typical of the remark by one dusty,
perspiring trooper, who, as he hurried
past a group of civilian sightseers ex
claimed :
"We've got our chance at last"
He grinned as he spoke.
A few women whose husbands were

Some wounded Mexicans were pick

some probably hit during fights with
