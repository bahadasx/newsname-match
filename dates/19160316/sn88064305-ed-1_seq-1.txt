UNITED STATES TO BUY NORTH=
ERN MEXIGO FOR $300,00O,00O
Washington Report Says Carranza Has Agreed to Plan
Understood that World Nations Are Won to Support
of Plan, and Will Thus Collect Their Old Debts.
Washington, Malrch 11.--Re
ports which have been current
in Wall streEt, leading financial
circles, several cities and politi
cal and diplomatic groups to the
effect that the administration
contemplates acquisition by pur
chase of the northern section of
Mexico and that Col. E. M. House
really went to Eu rope to "sound"
certain governments on this pol
icy, are now declared on author
ity that cannot be ignored to be
substantial and of extreme po
tentiality.
The plan, it is asserted, is to
purchase all of Mexico that is
north of a direct line drawn west
from the southerly outskirts of
the city of Tampico, including
the entire Lower California pen
insula. Colonel House, who re
cently returned from a trip
abroad as the special represent
ative of President Wilson, did not
discuss peace proposals alone, it
is declared here, despite denials.
On the contrary, he is confident
ly believed to have made inquiry
of leading statesmen of Great
Britain, France. Germany, Spain
and other nations as to what I
their attitude would be in case
the United States made such an
offer td Mexico.
Further, it is confidently be
lieved that the European powers
as a unit agreed that such a move
would not only be agreeable to
them, but even pleasing, for it I
would insure their being reim- I
bursed for losses sustained in j
the Mexican turmoil of recent t
years, which they could not ex
pect to collect without conflict
ing with the Monroe doctrine.
While leading men here say it I
will be extremely difficult to ap
proximate a price equitable to
such an enormous purchase, the
tentative figure mentioned' for
the basic offer will be about $300,
000,000.
Republican leaders say they
are forced to admit that such a
move ou the part of the Wilson
administration would be a "mas
ter stroke" on the eve of the
presidential election, and that no
RI epublican could oppose the
] plan.
i The two principal objects that
" interest all statesmen in the plan
is that the move would prevent
any "stretching" of the Monroe
Doctrine and at the same time
make this nation secure in that
all chance fr a foreign power
establishing a naval base on the
Pacific coast would be a future
impossibility.
Carranza will not object, it is
declared here tonight in quarters
that can hardly be questioned.
It is even stated that the recent
ly recognized Mexican tirst chief
has not only agreed to a prelim
inary consideration of the
scheme, but that this plan was a
part of the price exacted from
him previous to his recognition
by this country and similar rec
ognition by other powers.
Men who are in a position to
become unusually well informed
say that Col. House met with en
thusiastic approval when he sub
mitted the plan at Berlin. The
German government said it
would welcome the collection of
her indemnity by the United
States for the reason, first, that
she needed the money, and sec
ond, that she would be sure to
get it from the United States.
English, French and Spanish
officials also greeted the proposal
in an agreeable manner. The
leading bankers of this country
have been canvassed on the sub
ject and most of them agreed
that a loan for such a purpose
would be heavily oversubscribed.
This is a stupendous under
taking and probably the biggest
thing attempted in this country
since the CiQil war.
