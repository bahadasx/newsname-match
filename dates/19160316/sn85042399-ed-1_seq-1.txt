Drive Residents
To Beautify Street
Residents of Scenic Drive set a
precedent which might well be fol-,
lowed by the residents of other
streets by gathering at the home of
H. G. Gilmore Monday to discuss the
beautification of that already sightly
street and decide upon unnform
methods of securing the desired re
sults. As a result of the meeting the
property owners along Scenic Drive
will plant shade trees of the same
species and parkings and other fea
tures will be made symmetrical.
Throughout Ashland the street
beautification idea is taking a good
hold, and this spring will see a fine
start made on many of the streets
The Scenic Drive people are to bo
commended for their direct methods
in securing united and uniform ac-
tion in the good work.

Thieves Steal on
Immense Seal
For several months residents of the
Gold Hill neighborhood have been
missing a widely variegated assort
ment of trinkets ranging from a few
tons of copper wire, a blacksmith
shop, a 300-pound anvil, finally to a
complete nearly new Ford car. The
residents who were relieved of the
foregoing articles finally became 1 section are scheduled. Tliree-quar-slightly
irritated and began an in-1 ters of a deer were found in Kinney's
vestigation which resulted in a raid possession. The evidence was col-
unon the home of David Noe, a
mer Gold Hill marshal. The raid re
vealed the Ford carefully taken to
nieces and stored beneath the floor,
a'so the blacksmith equipment and a
goodly amount of copper wire. The
raid was made by Mr. Martin, Prose
cuting Attorney E. E. Kelly, Sheriff
Singler and Deputy Sheriff "Curly"
Wilson.
The raid was a complete surprise
to the wholesale thieves, being made
Just at the noon hour. Mr. Kelly
guarded the front entrance and Dep
uty Wilson the back door, which
opened Into a small alley. The search
was made on a warrant Bworn to by
Mr. Martin of the power company,
charging Noe with the theft of copper
wire. An electric motor was found
and many other pieces of valuable
machinery. Among the spoils was a
good deal of copper, and the authori
ties believe they have found the van
dals who relieved the Ashland mine
of much valuable copper and de
stroyed several hundred dollars'
worth of machinery.
When the sheriff and Martin en
tered the building Noe attempted to
escape through a side window In th
building into his neighbor's back
yard, and being hidden from view by
a high board fence, got three blocks
away before being seen by Deputy.
