TO KJ1. INDOOR MEETi
Indications Point to a Hot
Contest From First to
Last livent. i
RODKEY IS A FACTOR i
The Question Is: Can lie
Win the Ouarter-Mile,
Half-Mite and Relay?
Eighteen track men left :it 4 30
o'clock this aiu-ruoon to participate in
tlio Kan-as-MIssourl indoor iiuet to
morrow night in Contention Hall,
Kansas City. Those composing the
team art- Simpson, Powell, Warren,
Berr, Sjmon, Fowler, Com in, Gable
man. Ridi r. Lange, Miuton, Kativn
Medorp. Wyatt, Ilenick, Pittam and
Dagg). Lansing will care for the
team during the meet.
All indications point to a meet
which will be hotly contested through
each event dowji to the relay. The
"wise cms" have failed to agree up
HallsUlI Wednesday,
on th- winner, and the uncovering of
a surprise by either coach is likely to
decide the meet. The uarter-mile,
shot-put, high jump and relay are the
crucial eents in which the teams ap
pear evenly matched.
Medorp Will Not Htm Quarter.
II F. Schulte has given out that
Xcidorp will not run the quarter-mile.
Will Rodkey enter this event, think
ing he will liaie "pickinV and be able
to win without having to extend him
self sufficiently to injure his chances
in th" half-mile? And if ho enters
on this assumption, isn't someone
likely to push him to such an extent
that, if he wins at nil, he will be at
Rider's mercy in the half-mile, which
comes soon after? For be it known
that Missouri has three quarter-mil-ers
who have shown Medorp their
heels consistently so far this season,
with whom Kansas will have to reck
on before the excitement subsides in
the big hall tomorrow night.
Simpson and Ilenick will take care
of both heights of hurdles as well as
the FiO-yard sprint. If Kansas breaks
into the point column in any of these
events, it will bo a. tremendous sur
prise to everyone, the Kansans in
cluded. Has Holier relumed Jo Form!
Humors have been wafted over from
Iiwrence recently to the effect that
Captain Reher has got "right" again
in his event, the shot-put, and that
MisGi'ri's "pellet-pushers" will not
hac a look-in. Warren, you know,
teat tne Jpj l.awker cantain in the K.
C. A C criiiipctition. The big Tiger
h'aved the we'pht some -11 feet In tiy
outs recently, and Schulte is not feel
ing discouraged about Missouri's out
look in this event.
Trcweeke and Pittam will stage a
contest In the high jump, the result of
vhich will bear a critical relation lo
tap final scores. Cantain Powell in
the pole vault has been somewhat
ranrpenpped by a strained ligament
in his right ankle, but ho believes that

LIKE A REAL CIRCUS
Pupils of Grant School Give
a Carnival With
Many Stunts.
Hiugliiig's was in Columbia todaj ?
No, it was just the circus at the
Grant School. And a real cricus.
The procession included all the regu
lar features from the Wild West show
and th menagerie to a steam calliope
that really whistled. Trained animals
were a strong feature on the program.
Dogs jumped ropes, the elephant
walked a tight rope, the giraffe and
the zebra played see-saw, the trained
horso talked. Eeii the camel appear
ed.
All the whilo the band played and
the orchestra joined in. "Dixie" was
the favorite, and with a very little
help from the graphophone the audi
ence had tho illusion of a real circus,
especially when the barkers of the
sideshows were on their best mettle.
Two clowns also added reality to the
performance.
Tho Wild West show witli a most
impassive Indian chief and sure
enough yells was a strong favorite
with the spectators, it seemed. A
trapeze stunt and a ballet dance were
other features that drew much ap
plause. Side shows occupied another part
of tho building. The lixe-snake eater
proved not so dangerous, nor were
the suit in common law and the swim
ming match to be condemned by the
censors. The lawn-swing, the latest
walk, "superior to Charlie Chaplin,"
it was announced, a relic of a certain
heating plant and various hints for
cooks were among the other shows.
At tho cast end of the corridor one
found himself in Fairyland. Wisteria
blossoms and Japanese lantcrs hung
from the ceiling and stars covered the
walls. The King and Queen of Fairy
land entered, preceded by pages and
followed by eight attendants. While
the King and Queen sat upon the
throne the brownies danced until
when at their merriest, sixteen imps
rushed in and frightened the brownies
away.
The minstrel show was made up of
fourteen boys dressed up as darkles,
and Mr. Interlocutor. The jokes were
many and quite to the point. Jigging.
too, was not omitted, for while the
chorus sang "Say Chicken, If You
Dare," one little fellow shuffled his
feet in good time to the music.
Somewhat aside from the regular
circus was an exhibit of fancy work
and pure food. In the same room
was an old-fashioned fish pond.
Though there was no pink lemon
ade there was plenty of popcorn and
candy, peanut butter sandwiches and
coffee.
About 200 children took part in the
circus. The results were expressed
by one of tho many mothers as she
said to her noighbor, "It's just Bed
lam, but I wouldn't miss it for the
world."
Slephcns Girls Yl-it Nev. Market.
Today was Stephens College Day at
Hetzler Brothers' Meat Market. This
was evidenced by the college colors
which decorated the new- store. The
girls were served with the food now
being demonstrated.

A son was lorn last night to Mr.
and Mrs. J. M. Huckner of Mexico. Mo.

SPEAKER WARNS U.S.
OF SELF-I
Dr, H. H. Powers Declares
to Local Clubs That Com
placency Is Fatal.
"WAYS SPELL DOOM"
We're Following England's
Path Before the War,"
Lecturer Asserts.
America's accumulation of war prof
its, its "lazy, complacent, get-rich-quick"
attitude, is following almost
the same line of development of Eng
land before the war and will spell
"doom" for the United States unless
remedied, Dr. II. H. Powers told the
Noonday Club and tho Commercial
Club at their joint luncheon at the
Virginia Tea Room today.
The destruction of property in
European war has been greatly
aggerated. Doctor Powers said.
the
ex-
"If
you would visit some of the bomb-
det-trojed cities of Europe today, you
will probably have to hae a guide to
find the ruined district. The destruc
tion of all physical property in the
war has been less than that of the
great fire in Chicago in 1S91."
War Debts Xot Unbearable.
Doctor Powers said the burdensome
war debts are less a calamity than
the reports would lead one to believe.
The debts of the warring countries
are being taken care of in their own
countries. The debts are nothing less
than a transfer of fund from private
to public expenditure. "It is true
that sometime ago wo lent $300,000,
000 to the Allies. That was our In
come for about a week and lasted
them about two weeks. I am told that
only ;.7 per cent of the American
railroad securities abroad have been
returned to tne United States since
the war. Xo more goods can be de-
htrojed in this war than can bo made,
and when the nations get through
fighting the war will be paid for. The
great industrial plan will be intact."
Englishmen Improu-d by War.
Doctor Powers told of what a trans
formed nation England, for example,
will be when the war is over.
"The European world has been
transformed to a more serious-minded,
less flippant, reverent world by the
solemnity of the national cause.
"It has done a great good In mak
ing people useful. Men who had noth
ing to do but spend money are called
into a useful work. Golf-playing girls
are running the street cars and nurs
ing in the hospitals. When the war
is over, these people are not going
back to the indolent, idle life they led
before this war.
Warns America of poor Attitude.
"My warning to the American peo
ple is to quicken themselves to the
increased activity of the Europeans
thej will lie opposed to. America, as I
see it, is drifting along idly in a lazy,
complacent, get-rich-quick manner,
somewhat similar to that of England
before the war. 'Wc have gold and
cattle upon a thousand hills,' we
Americans brag, but will we be able
to compete with the more serious,
more productive and more patient Eu
ropean after the war? A recent maga
zine writer said upon landing In
America, 'Xew Xew is drunk with
wealth.'
"For years England has bragged of
its uncontested supremacy. We are
following England's footsteps, which
are sure to spell doom to us unless
we quicken up."

SUFFRAGISTS SEEKING
PLANK INPLATFORMS
Party Leaders Plan Parade at
Republican Convention
in Chicago.
MRS. MILLER IS BUSY
University Women Are Urg
ed to Establish Permanent
National Chapter.
With two national party conventions
only a few weeks away, the leaders
of the suffrage movement are direct
ing every effort toward obtaining a
plank in the platform of both the
Democratic and Republican parties.
One of the busiest of the leaders is
Mrs. Walter McNab Miller of Co
lumbia, president of the .Missouri
Equal Suffrage Association.
"At the Republican convention, to
be held in Chicago," said Mrs. Mil
Ici tcday, the suffragists are plan
ning a parade of 40,000 women, which
will start at the Congress Hotel and
end at the Coliseum. The enfranchis
ed women of Illinois will be an im
portant factor in the parade.
"At the Democratic convention, to
be held in St. Louis, there will be
.10 parade, but groups of women dress
ed in white, wearing yellow sashes
and carrying yellow banners, will
meet the eyes of the politician on
every side. A committee of men and
women from the enfranchised states
will make speeches before the com
mittee on resolutions urging it to put
an equal suffrage plank in its plat
form. Missouri will send to this con
vention women from every congress
ional district, and special cars will
bring representatives from every oth
er state in the Union.
"One of the most promising phases
of the whole question," said Mrs.
Miller, "is the attitude that the party
machines have taken. For the first
time they are with the women and
are working to help them insert the
suffrage plank."
Mrs. Miller has just received a let
ter from Mrs. E. P. House, executive
secretary of the Xational College
Equal Suffrage League, urging that
the University women establish a
chapter in connection with the league.
The organization here now is a local
one.
Mrs. House based her plea on the
fact that last summer in San Fran
cisco, at the biennial meeting of the
Association of Collegiate Alumnae, 247
of the 2CC delegates came instructed
to vote favorably on this resrlution:
"Resolved, that we, as a body o col
lide women, abdicated to tlie ,vomo
tion of educat'on and desirou? of
tullieririg our ability for usefuliu
f.uor suffrage for v omen."
MOULD EAK E.M, SAID FATHER
J. It. Mcllane, Seu-ntli Day AihentJst,
Wouldn't Scud Son (o School.
"The world's coming to an end
so what's the use," was the startling
hut complacently made statement
Truant Officer J. M. Pemberton en
countered recently at a Columbia
home. Many, many arguments have
been advanced against education, ever
since education began; but the abrupt
termination of life and its worries
well, there's something about it, says
.Air. Pemberton, that is rather baf
fling. It happened this way:
county superintendent of schools, call
ed at tho homo of J. B. McBane, 501
West Worley street, to learn why Cleo
.McBane, the S-year-old son, had never
been sent to school. He was told
that for various reasons instruction
was being given at home, but that as
yet the boy could not read.
Later J. M. Pemberton. truant offi
cer, was Informed by tho father, J.
II. McBane, who is a Seventh Day Ad
ventist, that the world was coming to
an end and education was useless.
In Judge .7. S. Bicknell's court this
morning, "religious scruples" was
given as tho reason for not sending
the boy to school, and the court was
assured that instruction was being
given at home.
A fine of $10 and costs was placed
against the father by Judge Bicknell,
but was remitted on condition that
the boy bo sont to school.
Co-eds Track Meet to He Saturday.
The first indoor gymnasium meet
held among University women in the
regular session will take place at 9:30
o'clock Saturday morning in the
Women's Gymnasium. Rope vaulting.
high jumping, volley ball and votato
relay racing will be included in the
contests.

WASHINGTON', .March 1C Presi
dent Wilson today expressed the hope
that President Carranza of Mexico
would be able to catch the elusive Vil
la before he was apprehended by the
United States troops.
No effort is being made in adminis
tration circles to conceal the satisfac
tion that would be felt if Carranza
should demonstrate the strength of
his government by bagging the bandit
chief.
The last raid of Villa nearly broke
the confidence of President Wilson
in the Carranza regime and the cap
ture of the bandit will do much to
restore a feeling of safety.
The great man hunt is continuing,
although no reports as to its progress
have been received. It is thought
that there are now about 5,000 United
States soldiers in Mexico.
