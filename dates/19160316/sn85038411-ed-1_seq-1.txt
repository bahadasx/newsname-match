As the United States expedition
which crossed into Mexico yes

"dead or alive," was peacefully
encamped last night not far from
Columbus, bandits crossed the
Rio Grande at Brownsville, near- j
!v a thousand miles away and I
fired on soldiers guarding a rail-;
road bridge, fifteen miles north
of the city.
They were beat off after more
than a hundred shots were ex
changed.
President \\ ilson was informed
to-day that both columns of
troops "somewhere" in Mexico
were meeting with hearty co
operation from the Carranza
si >ldicrs.
The military censorship is com-;
pletcly surpressing news of the
movements of the expedition now!
in Mexico.
The expedition across the bor-1
dcr was reported "doing well" by
General Pershing late this after
noon.
Villa and his bandits, mount-;
ed on speedy horses have passed |
the American Mormon colony at

them. Heavy army units arc be

the gap left by tlie taking of two'
columns into .Alexico.
Recruiting offices have been
thrown open in all parts of the
country ami Wellington is high

Band of Bandits Attacks
Soldiers Guarding Bridge
in Fastern Part of Texas
rtv Associated Press
Kingsville, Tex.. March 16. Mex
ican bandits said to iiavp numbered
about thirty tired upon sixteen Am
erican soldiers guarding the Burreda
bridge on the St. 1.0 u is, Brownsville
nnd Mexico ltailroad about 15 miles
north of Brownsville at 10 o'clock
last night. At least one hundred shots
were exchanged. None of the Amer
icans was injured. It is not known if
the bandits suffered any casualties.
While the light was in progress, a
train passing from the south was
tlaeged and stopped by an American
soldier. A guard of live soldiers on
the train rushed forward and rein-i
forced the men lighting at the bridge.
With the arrival of these reinforce
ments the bandits fled and are believed
to have escaped into Mexico.
This is the tlrst bandit trouble in
the Brownsville region since last Oc
tober. Troops guarding the railway 1
line have been ordered increased.
Advance Corps Spend
Quiet Night in Heart of
Deserts of Chihuahua
By Associated Press
El Paso. Tex., March IC. The
American expeditionary force which
has started to capture Puncho Villa
"alive or dead" had penetrated about
ten miles into Mexico, according to
the most reliable reports received here
to-day. |
The military censorship which has
been tightening its grip on the border
for some days permitted practically' 1
nothing but rumors to escape but it;
was fairly well established that the | '
advance corps of the American expedi- i
tion had camped last night in the ]
heart of the desert which lies be-1
tween the point of entry and the foot-j
hills of the Sierra Madres, a vast J
rang.i of mountains in the fastness of
which Villa is believed to have taken;
refuge.
But the interest of the border in the 1
American advance was practically;',
overshadowed by~ the question as to '
how !he presence of the soldiers of j
the United States on Mexican soil j,
would be taken by the troops of Car- .
ranzii. General Calles, the military i
governor of Sonora, was the "man of ' 1
the hour." His troops variously estl- '
mated at from 12.000 to 20,000 men, I i
garrisoned the frontier towns and the
immediate interior of the. section into! i
which the American soldiers had
entered. For days reports and rumors 1
that Calles troops were disaffected
an<i bitterly resented the pursuit of '
Villa by American soldiers have]
flooded this region. The definite an- | ,
Tiouncement that the Stars and Stripes. .
bad been carried over the interna-' J
tional line by armed forces increased ' i
these rumors ami reports to a deluge ! <
