U. S. TROOPS CROSS
MEXICAN BORDER
El PnHo, March 1(3.- It is unofficially
reported that 5000 troops crossed the
border Inst night and arc pushing
Kouthwnrd in pursuit of Villa. The
American army will work in conjunc
tion with Carranza troops coming up
from the south. It is expected to cup
turo the bandit and his followers in
a short time.
General Gabriel Gavira, command
nnt at Juarez, said today he hod re
ceived information that American
troops had noi yet crossed the border
and that they wuiv i.wniting permis
sion from General ("arranza before
doing so. Gavari said he believed
Cnrrnnzn's reply would he favorable.
Snys U. S. Commandi- Made Inquiry
(Jen. Gavira, after stating that the
American troops had not entered Mex
ico, said:
"My commander at I'alomas, Gen.
Hcrtnni, informed mo that tho Ameri
can commander at Columbus asked
him what the attitude of our first
chief would be toward American troops
pausing upon Mexican coil. I am now
awaiting a reply. Hut I feel sure that
my instructions will be favorablo to a
friendly cooperntion of the American
and Mexican troops against Villa."
Consul Andres Garcia, today, beforo
whom tliis statement was made, said
he agreed with Gavari's opinion.
Juarez is Calm and Quiet
UumorH of the advance of the puni
tive force did not disturb the usual
calm of Juarez today. Tho garrison
soldiers appeared entirely friendly to
visiting Americans, as was the native
population.
Gutierrez Directs Campaign
Even the departure of Gen. Luis Gu
tierrez, commander in tho stnte of Chi
huahua, in a special train for tho
south, occasioned nothing beyond a
mild interest. The general's train con
sisted of two passenger coaches nnd
three box car, lilted within and on
top with his armed escort. He will
personally direct operations against
Villa.
No Hostility Against Americans
Speaking of the rumors of popular
resentment ngainst Americans in Mex
ico, consul Garcia said:
"The excitement, so far ns I am able
to learn, is entirely on the American
side of the border. I haven't heard
of a single nuthentic case of Carran
cista soldiers threatening the persons
of Americans. Perhaps a few indivi
dual soldiers have called the Ameri
cans names, ns has been charged, but
I myself have often been called names
on the American side. Our forces arc
well under discipline and there is no
liklihood of any outrage against
Americans of nny sort."
Alt Friendly Gavira
Gavira added:
"1 know that there has been none of
the reported resentment among my
men. We are all friendly disposed to
the United Stnt s nnd hor citizens."

MACHINE GUNS FAIL TO
WORK WHEN VILLA ATTACKS
Villa's men entered Columbus by
killing the 13th cavalry sentinel who
wns stationed on the extreme edge
of tho 13th cnvalry camp near town.
This was what Lieut. C. C. Benson,
who was brought to El Paso from
Columbus Thursday afternoon on the
Golden State Limited, stated upon
his nrrivnl here.
Ho said It seemed there were 1500
VillistPS who swooped down on tho
camp where less thnn 200 men wore
enenmped. As the sentinel was the
first ono killed, it was impossible for
him to give tho alarm and the Mex
icans were in tho camp before tho
other sentinels could give the alarm.
Tho lieutenant said there were
about 34 Mexicans killed during the
fighting. How mnny moro wore
killed, ho did not know, he said, as he
was wounded through the hund during
tho early part of the lighting.
Civilians in Columbus ns well as
cavalrymen participated in the battle
at dawn Thursduy. Every American
who could get a pistol or rifle engaged
in tho fighting nnd took pnrt in the
running fight, according to the South
western trainmen. They said dead
Mexicans were to bn fnnnd Imhlnd
every bush near the town nnd they
plnccd tho estimate of the dend much
higher thnn given in the official
reports.
Thut moro Villistas were not killed
in tho attack made by the bandit
leader nt Columbus, wns explained in
El Paso Thursday afternoon, when
private Thomns Burtmon, sitting on
tho back of nn ambulance bent in ,'
wounded soldiers to the hospital said
that tho American mnchinc guns
clogged up nnd could not be used.
He also stated that instead of 1000
men ns wns originnlly reported, there
were not moro thnn 250 in the 13th
in camp nt Columbus nnd that tho
troons had nut Utl n wnndnrfnl (Itrlit
against great odds. Many of the men
were shot while getting up from their
ocus, wane the eight men killed were
largely the line men. "Geo, but they
were a fine lot of fellows," ho added.
The Wounded Men
Tho wounded men hrcAipht. h
Thursdny afternoon from Columbus
and taken in hospital ambulances to
rort uiiss were: Lieut. Clarence C.
Benson, wounded in the riirht
John V. Yarborough, shot in tho loft
lorearm; ineodoro Katzorke, shot
through both thiirhs: .Tnmcs Vmnnr.
gunshot wound in right breast; Josso
P. Taylor, one scalp wound on left
side of head and two wounds in right
thigh and right leg; Michel Barwinzel,
gunshot wound in tho neck.
Tho men were hroue-ht to El Pnsn in
charge of privates Tlnmns Burtmon
nnd E. M. Johnson of the 13th cavnlry
Hospital corps. Tho men stood the
trip well nnd the one in the best "on
dition, Kntzorke, ns'.ed: "What is
Wilson going tc do?" and added: "f.1.1
him know thnt the 13th is not ton
proud to fight."
Pursue Villistas Afoot
The Hospital cornse innn smv thnt
Villa took the camn bv surnrisn nnd
that most of the men save the line
men were asleep. The horses and line
men were amonir the first to bn shut
at by the Villistas. They also said that
mo urst pursuit or Villa and his men
was not on horseback, but afoot and
that the horse pursuit came later.
"Wo know that Villn was nlnni'."
Johnson said, "because an American
woman who had been c.iptured by him
in lower Lnlhunhua and who itrniiod
to tho American side, said thnt Vllin
had lead the raid."

VILLISTAS RETURN
NEAR COLUMBUS
Columbus, N. M., March 11. Army
border patrols and armed civilians
are maintaining a close watch for the
reappearance of Mexican bnndits along
the bolder. A repoit that armed
Mexicans had appeared opposite Gib
son's ranch, 15 miles west, wns being
investigated by military authorities.
Immediately on receipt of this report,
a considerable body of civilians left
hero in automobiles. Unconfirmed ru
mors that Mexicans were nenr Victoria
were received.
Train Crew Heavily Armed
Train No. 8 of the E' Pnso & South
wu.Horn railroad, enstbound, renched
here at 0 a. m., with tho crow and most
passengers heavily armed. The train
cicw reported all quiet nt Hnchitn nnd
Victoria, where American cnvalry and
infantry were posted.
Troops nro scattered all along the
road from Hatchita to Columbus.
7." Mexican Dead Picked Up
Soldiers and citizens divided atten
tion to the vigil nlong tho internation
al boundary with the work of clearing
Thursday's battle field of Mexican
dead. Early in the day approximately
75 Mexican dead had been found on
the American side and were cither
buried or burned. They were pointed
to by American officials as an evidence
of the effectiveness of tho fire of the
American troops.
Mnj. Tompkins, who yesterday af
ternoon returned to Columbus with
troopers that followed Villa into Mex
ico, estimated the Mexican dend in the
battle with Villa's rear at fully 100.
Several Wounded Mexicans Found
Several wounded Mexicans, who had I
lain out all night, were found in the
brush nnd taken to the nrmy hospital.
Communication Equipment Lacking
Lack of field telegraph and tele
phone equipment, it was learned, was
responsible for the delay in the arri
val of two troops of cavalry from the
tation nt Gibson's rnnch. Word of
tho Columbus fighting was not re
ceived there until 8 o'clock. Although
Maj. Elmer Lindsley started imme
diately it was almost two hours later
beforo ho reached Columbus with his
two troops.
Lopez Had Evans Pocket hook
The pockctbook of T. M. Evans, ono
of the eighteen Americans massacred
.lanunry 10, at Santa Ysnbcl, Chihua
hua, was found on the body of tho
Mexican officer , identified ns Pablo
I.opcz, second in command to Villa.
Wounded Mexicans said it was gener
ally stated among Villa troops that
while Lopez led in the massacre, he
acted without order from Villa.
Gen. Garcia Dies
Two Mexicans wounded died nt the
American army hospital here during
the night. One of these wns a Villn
genernl mimed Garcia.
A BOOSTER BOOKLET
A special meeting o1" the Board of
Directors of the Tucumcari Business
Men'.- Association, wa held Tuesday
afternoon March Mth, to go into the
matter of tho publication of a Chum
iior of Commerce Booklet. Resolu
tions were passed endorsing tho plan
to publish the same, and a committee
composed of Royal A. Prentice, Dr.
V. . Loniing, T. A. Muirhead, and J. A.
Sale, was appointed to compile the
data and statistics, and to write up
the subject matter of the book. These
committeemen will work in conjunc
tion with the secretary, Ray Z. Boycr,
Herbert Smith, manager of the Exper
iment farm, and tho editors of tho
local newspapers. Mr. Sale, of the
.Sale Bros. Studio will take tho pic
tures free of charge, the cuts will be
furnished at cost, and tho printing
done 111 the locnl shop.i at cost.
The booklet will dcfcriho and illus
rate the development of Tucumcnii,
ami will show tho resources und oppor
tunities within Tucumcari and Quay
county; in fact, it will contain all in
formation that is of interest to a pros
pective homesccker or investor. What
interested inquirers do die is accurate
and complcto information, and the
purpose of the pamphlet is to furnish
Mich information in nn attractive nnd
educational manner.
Many farmers are moving to New
Mexico, and as Quay county is one
of the best agricultural counties in
the state, it is believed thnt the book
let will bo instrumental hi locating a
number of settlers in this district.
It would bo well to crtticiso tho
pamphlet in advanco as all will be in
terested in what it contains. Every
citizen can be n worker for a lnrgor
Tucumcari, und a boostor for a richer
county. Tho residents of this section
can boost conscientiously ns there arc
1 cat opportunities here. A personal
boosting letter sent out with a Cham
ber of Commcrco booklet is likely to
"bring homo somo bacon."
BANK STATEMENTS
The two Tucumcari banks have con
densed statements in tho News this
week which show thnt the money
question in Quny county is remaining

Columbus, N. M., March 10, '10
Dear Folks:
Guess you have heard tho news from
Columbus and gotten our mcssngo
this u. m. We nro nil right now. The

We partly dressed, I put on my shoes
and Uockings and coat, nnd Arch had

shawl around Lnurn and went. Its a
wonder a bullet didn't hit us, but we
went fast. Wo camo in this n. m., a
crowd of us, and found tho town shot
up, nine civillnns killed, C soldiors,
nnd they were hauling the dead Mcx
ienns out like thoy were refuse, just
(lUmncu them in wnirnn'i nnd tnnlr thnm
out of town and burned the boding.
Twos awful, the Mexicans intended

FIRM NOTE ON OUTRAGE
Washington, March 9. Tho Mexi
can question broke out in congress
late today. Senator Fall of New Mex
ico, announced that he had prepared
a resolution to authorize recruiting
nn urmy of 500.000 to intervene in
Mexico nnd aid the existing authorities
in stamping out brigandage, while in
tho house, Representative Mondcll,
Republican, of Woymlng, started dc
bnte with a speech attacking tho ad
ministration's Mexican policy.
Late today the United States sent
a formnl notification of tho Columbus
massacre to General Carranza through
Amorican Consul Silliman.
A dispatch from General Pershing
forwarded to the war department late
today, through General Funston,
personally.
THE AMERICAN TETTRAZINI
Leeta Lynn Corder, who is the so
prano soloist of the Schubert Sym
phony Club of Chicago und a great
favorite in nil of the principal Amer
ican and Canadian cities, has been
spontaneously called "Thu Amerlcnn
Tettrazinl" by many capablo critics.
She sings all the greatest soprano so
los without apparent effort and at ull
times has perfect command of every
tone from E to below middle C to the
third G above middle C. She studied
six years under Mndnme Smytho of
London, who wa.s a pupil of Patti's
uncle in the snme class with Pntti's
sister, besidea receiving further vocal
training from such world-famous
teachers as DoVrics, Arcangeli and
others. She is one of the really great
vocalists of the day and our music
lovers should not full to hear hor.
Tho great popularity of tho Schu
bert soloists is not altogether on ac
count of their grnnd voices, but in part
because they study to please the peo
ple. All of their encores aro either
amusing, or artistic arrangements of
those sweet old melodies so dear to all
American hearts. Hear them at tho
Presbyterian church on April 3rd.
THE GAMBLER
Tell us not in mournful numbers life
is but one long sad scene, and the man
is dead who labors, daylight through
for just a bean; lives of Rockcy und
of Morgan, both reminds us we nro
hicks, if we try to make a living with
our shovels nnd our picks. Rather go
wo to tho city, to the busy marts of
trade, nnd regale ournclvcs in filers
till our fortuno has been made; gather
in both right nnd left, get It quick
nnd get it enrly, you can do it if you're
left. Let the other fellow labor, let
them skive and sweat nnd dig; we will
nestle by tho ticker, gather in tho
shekles big. Mnttors not if wo'vo a
billion, we will keep on getting more;
not a bit of mercy show them, what
care wo If thoy nro poor? What caro
wo If baby's dying, just for milk und
good fresh air, if tho extra gouge wo
glvo them, classes us a millionaire?
No, you bet we'll have no morcy, tho
they rnvo and rail and cuss, old man
KIDD and nil his pirntca never had
a thing on us. And you hot ho novcr
will have, when it comos to squeezing
tight. Why, wo'd oven bo so low down
as to swipo tho widow's mito, if wo
thought thnt In so doing wo could add
nnother tier to tho millions wo have
honrded ero wo go unto our bier.
It is said that a professor has dis
covered among somo ancient ruins
what is supposed to bo the eleventh
commnndment, which read ns follows:
"Emas rof yltpmorp tsoyap uoht

Tho commandment is easily trans
lated by beginning at tho end and read

RABBITS STEAL FLOWERS
It has been broucrht to mv nttcnMrm
that fresh cut flowers have recently
disappeared from the graves in our
cemetery, much to the indignation and
uisnppoiniment ot tno loving friends
who plnccd them there. As audi dep
redations have never nemirrpd linfnrn.
and ns there arc no mi eh irhnnl In o"r
community to enjoy in their homes
flowers stolen from n cemetery. I huve
tried to discover the cause. Tho dep
redation seems to bo limited to car
nntions which nro nipned down to the
rim ot tno vessel holding them, whilo
roses nre untouched. If nnv nnrmn
would nilfer them, thov wmdd mdl
out the whole stem. Tho culprits nro

sweet morsels for them. M. H. Koch.

After this i.isue Tho Endee Enter

Wo are sorry to cause the change, but

In ono wny wo have been a failure
