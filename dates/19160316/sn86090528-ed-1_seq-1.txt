COOPER CONTRIBUTES GOOD
ONE TO FORD JOKE COLUMN
O. C. Cooper county agricultural
agent, is the driver of an asthmatic
Ford, five or less passenger auto car.
And the car has, during the time it
has been the property of Mr. Cooper,
done valliant service. It has covered
multitudicus miles of ; Grady county
geography; it has climbed hills at
which a less determined piece of me
chanism would have balked; it has
w heezed and barked and coughed and
struggled and ripped and ranted and
ctood upon its, hind legs and snorted
and spit fire and gasoline vapor, but
it has always "got there."
So persistent has this piece of
traveling machinery been In reaching
its destination whenever tried, that;
Mr. Cooper had become used to plac
ing his trust impliclty in it. Friends
state that Mr. Cooper had grown so
blind in his confidence in this car
that it wa3 his wont to crank the
varmint, jump aboard and throw in
the clutch without giving a thought
to tho car's mechanism. "The hind
wheels will get there, just a little bit
aflor the front wheels arrive," was
Mr. Cooper's belief unsliattered un
til this week.
Tuesday afternoon, in company with
County Superintendent Shcpard and
Mrs. Coryell, Mr. Cooper was out on
school visiting business, ibusily en
gaged In telling the young Ifleas how
to organize corn and cotton eiubs and
raise blue ribbon hogs. Ho had left
me school house and was transporting
his co-workers to Tuttle wtre ad
dresses were to be delivered nd clubs
organized that evening. With Mr.
Cooper at tha helm all was gOvhg mer
rily as a whole community of luarriagf.

front at Saloniki, Greece, to welcome
bells when, like the wonderful one
horse shay of dead and gonu days,
something began to rattle nd to
bump and to bang
"Bumpety, bumpety, bump, bang.
bangey, bang, bang," spoke the
something or other of the Ford.
The transport took a decided list
to starboard, but the undismayed
helmsman kept the vessel's nose
straight ahead, while the prow bit
deeply into the wind-tossed billows
cf sand.
"Seems like this buggy is running
a little heavy," shouted Mr. Cooper to
his passengers. "Seems like its run
ning awfully rough," thought the pas-f.-ngers
as they clung to the seats
and longed for the shores of Tuttle
to heave in sight. At last
"Hey there! Wait a minute! Hold
up! For the love of Mike stop 'er!"
fchouted Mr. Shcpard. ' "Don't you see
you've dropped your rear wheels?"
And such was the case. Stopping
the car, Mr. Cooper turned about and
witnessed tho strange sight of the rear
wheels of his Ford merrily chasing
the balance of the car down the long
hill, the slope of which the car was
descending at the time ot ihe acci
dent. A kindly rural mail carrier hasten
ed a distress call into the garage at
Tuttle; a relief wagon was sent out;
the Ford was transported into the
work shop and the speakers were on
time to meet their differing audi
ence. The car had actually traveled a hun
dred yards or more down the hill on
its front wheels, dragging ita rear,
tied-like, through the sand.
