British Company's Claim on Septio

Cities.
The city of Bemidji will join with
other cities in Minnesota to attack
in courts the validity of the claim
of the Cameron Septic Tank company
of England that it is entitled to a
three per cent royalty a year on all

ties in this country.
A meeting of representatives of 46
Minnesota municipalities, directly in
terested in the matter, is being held
today at the state university. Plans
will be made. i
Only Pipestone Has Paid.
There are forty-one municipalities
in Minnesota that have installed sep

the British company.
Bemidji has not paid the assess

Precedents in Conflict
Dr. Bracken said today that at
Saratoga, N. Y., some time ago it
was decided the Cameron company's
British and American patents were
the same. A recent case in Ken
tucky was decided to the effect that
the patents were not the same, and
'that the company has until October to
enforce its demands, and for six
years thereafter before the patent
runs out.
The company, Dr. Bracken said,
recently has started out to obtain as
many royalties as possible before its
patents terminate.
