Public Opinion Should
Devise Means to Pre
vent Railway Strikes
By HOWARD ELLIOTT, Chairman
of the Board of the New York, New
Haven and Hartford Railroad
MUST not public opinion devise
some means that will mukr
impossible even the enncop
tion of a plan to paralyze the entir
railway system of the country ?
Today labor says, "1 can do witl
my own as J like, and if 1 want t
4op work that is my business."
ONLY A FEW YEARS AGO CAPI
TAL SAID THE SAME ABOUT VA
RIOUS UNJUST DISCRIMINATIONS
AND UNFAIR PRACTICES, AND
THE PUBLIC STOPPED IT.
, Does not a man when he elects
to earn his living by working for n
public service corporation enter into
a moral obligation to the public to
keep that corporation at work pend
ing a dispute over wages and work
ing conditions until that dispute is
settled in nn orderly manner?
Should that obligation be made not
simply a moral one, but a hu
mane, patriotic and even legal one?
Country Needs a Navy
Sufficient For Its
Defense
By S. STAJWOOD MENKIN, Pres
ident of the National Security
League, Incorporated
THERE is a crisis in national pre
paredness. This mean 6 there
is a crisis in the affairs of the
nation. We want a«navy sufficient
for our defense. We want it now
and demand its construction on sci
entific, businesslike, economic line?
under the direction of the best
equipped man in the country, and
ire CANNOT BELIEVE IN ANY
ONE'S CONVICTIONS IN FA
VOR OF PREPAREDNESS WHO
DOES NOT RECOGNIZE THE
GOOD SENSE OF THIS DECLA
RATION.
Congress won't act unless certain
of the views of those they represent,
and the people of this country are
quite clear as to certain matters,
among others that they have spent
a good deal for defense in the past
and got little for it, and if they are
to spend more they want to be sure
that they will get full value and
that the best guarantee of this re
sult is in proper control of expendi
ture by the master workmeb of in
dustry.
GOOD INTENTIONS CAN NEVER
SUPPLANT EXPERIENCE ANP
TECHNICAL SKILL.
