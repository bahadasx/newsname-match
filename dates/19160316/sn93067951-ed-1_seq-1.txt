K .' i
n Wests Found Guilty;
Arants Acquitted
Tr.e great Pagcland riot and
% murder trial is now a thing of
. the past. A jury of twelve g>od
i. citizens have spoken, and it is
i- to be hoped that the affair thus
. closed will remain so.
t After five days consumed in
the examination of witnesses
- and in the three-cornered debate
e of legal counsel, the case went
s to the jury Friday afternoon at
. 5 o'clock. A verdict was returns
three hours later exonerating the
. Arants of all blame for the riot
and bloodshed and finding J. E.
? We6t, Baxter West, Arthur
. West, Sheppard West and Luther
West guilty of riot.
i The Wes>8 were sentenced to
1 pay a fine of $150.00 each or to
? serve one year on the chaingang.
Small Gases Disposed Of f
After the closing of the Arant
\ case at the recent term of court
several small cases were expedi,
tiously settled.
In the case of the State vs J.
W. Boan, illegally disposing of
property, Boan was fined $100.
i J. I'aul Jones, accused of assault
with intent to kill; ca*e
was postponed.
Oeorge Maugum. charged with
violating the dispensaiy law, was '
fined $100. Half of the fine was
remitted on probation. A $50
fine hangs over Mango m as an
inducement to good behavior.
Harvey Turnage, accused of
illegally disposing of property.
This case was compromised.
Charles Campbell Sentenced ,
One of the last acts of the i
Criminal Court at the recent session
was t he sentencing of Charles
Campbell, colored, to the chaingang
for life for the killing of
Lester Hancock, white, on the
night of the 23d of last October.
I nil.:- ? i i ?
una Killing, iv win ne remembered,
was peculiarly sordid.
The fight arose, apparently, over
a discus1 ion of who should pay
for wine that had been drunk by
a group of white men and negroes.
Charles Campbell was allowed
to plead guilty to manslaughter
and Louis Campbell, who was
implicated, was freed.
[Moonshiners Captured
A still was raided in the Black
Creek district near Middendorf
last week and three captives
haled to court by Kural I'olicem&n
K. C. Moore. They were,
Mr. Britt and 6on and a Mr.V
KingThe
elder Brirt, a preacher by
profession, and King were released
on bond to appear at the
next term of court.
Young Britt, unable to furnish
bond, wae allowed to plead guilty
aud was sent to the chaingAiig
on an indeterminate sentence.

Announcements
For Supervisor
We are authorised to announce

y date for County Supervisor sul ject

cratic primary.
James T. Grant
Tho l'ageland war last March
developed a real hero in the person
of Rural Policeman James T.
Grant.
Mr. Grant had been detailed
to Pageland only a few days be
fore tho riot and was unknown
to nearly all participants in the
shooting affray and, therefore,
when he, as a peace officer, undertook
to quell the riot, he was
at a disadvantage in that it was
not generally known that he was
an officer.
Jim Grant, however, from the *
first disturbance made every at- "
tempt to prevent the riot. |
During the melee of shots?
while half & dozen men were
emptying deadly weapons at each
other?Jim Grant was the one
man not engaged as a participant
in the riot who did not run.
Testimony at the trial showed
that Mr. Grant had arrested and
disarmed Wesley Arant, and,
sti 11 holding him by the arm,
had turned to Sheppard West,
who was doing deadly work with
a rifle. He had no more than
called to West, "Don't shoot,"
than the shot was fired that
killed Arant, who fell into the
officer's arms. Grant then cross- ed
the street, secured the riflj
and arrested its owner, then proceeded
to disarm the other par- ^
ticipants.
Ilow Grant escaped all injury
is remarkable.
During the course of the trial
it was a notable fact thar not a
lawyer could mention the testimony
of this man without taking
time to pay his respects to Mr.
Grant for his valor and devotion
to duty.
Stevenson for Rural Credits ?
