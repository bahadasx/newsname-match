General Pershing's Command Crossed Boundary Line
Near Columbus, N. M., at Noon Yesterday
A SMALLER COLUMN CROSSED FURTHER WEST
The Two Commands Should be in Touch With Each Other
Before the End of the Week Not Until After Friday
Are Sharp Developments Expected Campaign Begun
Yesterday Will Continue Until Villa is Captured or Killed
A Mexican Force of 400 Men Has Joined the American
Force Will Remain Under Their Own Commander,
But a Number of Them May be Employed as Scouts.
San Antonio, Texas, March 15.
Brigadier General John J. Pershing,
With more than 4,000 troops, began the
pursuit in Mtexico today of Francisco
Villa, whose raid across the border
last week caused President Wilson and
his cabinet to decide to use the Unit
ed States army to run him down.
Crossed Boundary Line.
General Pershing's report that he
and his command had crossed the in
ternational boundry line just south of
Columbus, reached General Frederick
Funston, in charge here of general op
erations, late today.
His repoit served to dispel to a
great extent fears that had been en
tertained in same quarters that resis
tance would be offered by the troops of
the de facto government. Colonel Ber
talni, the commanding: officer of the
Carranza garrison at Pair mas, on the
southern side of the dividing line,
promptly joined General Pershing. His
force was only some 400 men, but they
were reported to have displayed will
ingness and even eagerness to join In
the chase. As a body the Mexican
troops will remain under their own
commander, but a number of them are
being employed as scouts by General
Pershing.
Reports to Be Made to Funston.
Reports of progress in the country
where the search has been begun will
be made by General Pershing to Gen
eral Funston, but it is not anticipated
that these will be frequent or deal
with any but the more important de
velopments. No Developments Until After Friday.
How far into Mexico the column has
reached was unknown here tonltfht,
nor did General Funston appear great
ly concerned. . General Pershing's
course for the next two days is known
Dt headquarters and not until after
Friday are sharp developments expect
ed. Another Column Moving Southerly.
Colonel George A. Dodd, heading a
smaller column that entered Mexico
some distance west of Columbus, also
Is moving in a southerly direction and
those two forces should be within
touch of each other before the end
of the week. By that time it is ev
pected that an infantry support will
hold the lines of communication along
which motor trucks for the transporta
tion of nrpmunitlnn and supplies will
be operated. Although the censor
ship imposed by General Funston was
relaxed tonight, efforts still were mad
to keep secret the details of the p'an
of campaign, the exact number of men
engaged and their actual locations.
Continue Until Villa is Captured or
Killed.
General Pershing has gone into Mex
ico with orders to overtake and wipe
out Villa and his organization. Un
less orders to th,o contrary are re
ceived from these higher in authority
than General Funston the campaign
that was begun today will continue
until Villa is captured or killed.
SILENCE MAINTAINED
BY WAR DEPARTMENT
Censorship One of Most Complete
Country Has Ever Known.
Washington, March 15 Throughout
the day the war department main
tained rigid silence as to the situation
on the border. General Funston was
moving his pieces in the grim game
with Villa behind a curtain of com
plete eecrecy. It probably was the
most complete censorship the country
has ever known. The screen was
drawn so close that the department
itself was not advised of the cross
ing until hours after the troops were
on the march.
The only despatch as to the border
situation received by Secretary Baker
during the afternoon dealt with the
departure of the Eleventh Cavalry,
from Chattanooga to reinforce the
border patrol.
Rumors flew about the corridors of
the war department all day. Some
dealt with reported fighting on both
eides of the border.
One said a regiment of American
cavalry had been annihilated. Depart
ment officials had no reports on which
such Statements could have been
founded.
Only meagre news bulletins from
the troops In Mexico are expected.
AMERICANS AT PRESIDIO, TEX,
GROUPED FOR PROTECTION
Beoauae of Outbreaks Among Carran

Presidio, Texas, March 15. All

The Mexicans are greatly excitea
over reports that are being spread
from unknown sources misrepresent
ing the actions and intentions of the
United States.
Santiago Joojas, a deputy sheriff of
Presidio, was reported today to have
been killed by Villa bandits a few
miles from OJinaga.
CARRANZA TROOPS IN
BARRACKS AT JUAREZ
Forbidden by Commanding Officer to
Frequent Saloons
Juarez, Mexico, March 1 5 There are
about 1,000 troops in this - town and
nearly all were confined to barracks
today. They have been forbidden by
General Gavira to frequent saloons.
Nothing stronger than beor is per
mitted to be sold in the town.
In a statesfvent issued late today
General avlra said:
"My selfiiers are absolutely loyal
and there is no danger of any out
breaks in this section. Ihave received
reports that Colonel Riojas has been
murdered by the troops at Ojinaga and
am trylnr te get in communicaticn
with thr t Tn, but so far have failed.
Ther '. eason whatever for any
hostility a -d Americans on the part
of loyal " eiicans and I have astur
a'neesitht all troops In my districts
act in concord with the American
who pursuing Villa. I am in
cowipiete control of the situation here."
General Gutierrez left here todav
for Chihuahua to take command of
one of five columns of 1200 men each
who are declared bv General Gavira to
fee closing in on Villa in the Casas
Grandes region.

circling over the Mexican plain which
had swallowed up the American sol
diers earlier in the day the aeroplane
returned to camp. The town and
neighborhood are quiet tivnisrht. The
military censorship Is strictly main
tained. REPORTS OF DISASTER TO
MORMONS IS ERRONEOUS
Despatches Say the Casas Grandes
Region is Quiet.
El Paso. Texas, March 15. W. W.
Pearson, general attorney for the
Pearson Lines here, said today that
reports of a disaster to the 500 Mor
mons about Casas Grandes, who have
been threatened by Villa, are un
founded. He said that te telegraph
wires have been working all day into
the Casas Grandes region and that
lulet was reported there.

of perjury by direction of Justice

pr County Surpreme court here to
day. Justice Thompkins In a long opinion
held that Dr. Rudolph Piedling. a state
prison commissioner, was without le
gal authority when he investigated Os
borne's administration of Sing Sing.
It was gefore Pr. Died'ing thnt Os
borne last October committed the al
leged perjury by swearing, ns charged
that he was without knowledge of cer- I
tain cases of immorality.
Justice Tompkins in his opinion said
thnt there was no lawful perjury com-:
mitted by Osborne, inasmuch as the '
warden had the riirht to kep lnvotate
the pledges which he had given to the
guilty convicts -tin had confessed to
him their immorality.
When Justice Tor pkins 1-ad render
ed his opinion and discharged the jury,

al shipments of arms, ammunition or
rrpIoMves consigned to Meyiro. except j
such as it is clearly established ara
designed for the de facto government.
The order was said tonight to be the
outcome of information reaching tho
department that a large eonsienmont
of explosives intended for the Villa
forces was about to be sent south. The
instructions are sweeping in character
a' d forbid shipments to an point in
Mexico along the northern border or
to any seaport. They will sh:it off

other persons not offlcia'ly represent
ing the Cai-ranra government.
T3ow long they will remain in force

tainly will not be revoked until there
is apparently no chance of any arms

sympathizers.

the subject but there wa-i reason to
believe some credence had been plac-

PREDICTION CANAL WILL
BE REOPENED APRIL 15.
Conditions in Gsillard Cut Said to
Justify the Prediction.
Washington. March 15. An official
prediction that the Panama Canal will
be re-opened by April 15 for the pass
age of d't-p draft vessels was an
nounced by the war department.
Conditions in Gaillr.rd Cut, scene of
the principal earth movement, which
blocked the waterway last fall, are
regarded as Jiis-.lfylng the forecast.
Colonel Harding, acting governor of
the canal zone, telegraphed the war
depaitment today as foliows:
"Conditions Gaillard Cut justify pre
dictions that canal will be available
for ships of thirty feet draft on April
15. subject to probable temporary de
lays thereafter to meet exigencies of
dredging fleet In completing canal to
full width anl depth and In removing
shoals that may possibly develop."
Until this report came, canal officials
had refused since the closure to make
any estimate of the probable date of
re-orening. Colonel Harding's tele
pram Is taken to mean that unless an
other great movement of earth occurs
has proceeded without paue. When
the canal Is re-opened It will have ad
vanced In equipment far beyond the
point It ha l reached when the elides
began. Facilities for ouick handling
of ships will be much better.
