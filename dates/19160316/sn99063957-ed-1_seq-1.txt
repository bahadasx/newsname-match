Resignation Follows Dis
agreement with Chancellor
VcnBethmann-Hollwe?
The Hague, Mar. (!. Resignation of
Grand Admiral Von Tirpitz of the Ger
man navy means an end to the attempt
to force ruthless submarine attacks on
non-belligerent vessels, according to re
liable advices today.
It caused rejoicing among Berlin citi
zens who were anxious to preserve good
relations with the United States, The
resignation was considered a personal
triumph for IThporinl Chancellor Von
Betliuiann-Hollweg, who is a strong ad
vocate of conciliation with America.
Berlin advices said a further change
in the ministry of mniiuc was not ex
pected. The resignation came on the
eve of the opening of a reichstag ses
sion at which Von Tirpitz supporters
planned a war on Honweg's program.
Hollweg, returning from a conference
with the kaiser at Verdun, declared
the ruler supported him. Von Tirpitz
then resigned, and Admiral Von, Capel
le, director of the admiralty's admin
istration department was appointed his
temporary successor. The appointment
will probably be miu?i! permanent, it ia
believed.
Overwork and anxiety aggravated by
the failure of his submarine plans
brought the aged Von Tirpitz to the
verge of a complete breakdown. The
kaiser accepted his resignation with re
gret, after vainly trying to win him
over to the Hollweg program. Von Tir
pitz will be decorated with, honors and
retired on a pension.
Market Was Irregular
But Generally Stronger
Xew York, Mar. Hi Tho New York
Sun's financial review today s.iid:
Heavy realizing sales were again in
evidence on the market. They impart
ed some irregularity to the general list,
but concentrated buying continued in
special issues. Some improved exten
sively. The undertone in industrials
was strong.
Railways were largely neglected
throughout the early trading, and their
general tendency was heavy, Canadian
Pacific was very weak. The latter con
dition was associated with the domin
ion government's contemplated Ameri
can loan of $75,000,000 and equal cred
it with Canada's chartered banks.
Trading centered largely on war
stocks and specialties was mostly pro
fessional. First prices were uniformly
higher, .ind business was conducted up
on a scale of large activity. When j
speculative interest lagged in one issue
or profit taking became too heavy for
further improvement, another was tak
en in hand. Thus Crucible Steel, Amer
ican Can and Baldwin Locomotive in
turn held the center of the stage. Uni
ted States Steel started at a good frac
tional a.lvnnct and was actively dealt
in, but was overshadowed everywhere.
Speculative conditions were unchang
ed in the liter trading. Interest was
confined to industrials.

GREATEST DANGER OF
CLASH COMES FROM
IGNORANCE OF PEONS
By Robert J. Bender.
(I'nited Press Staff Correspondent.)
Washington, Mar. 10 President Wil
son hopes that General Carrnnza will
capture Francisco Villa.
.The administration today nude no
effort to conceal the satisfaction it
i would give to have Carranza bag Villa
belore the Americans can reaca him.
Villa's raid on Columbus neirly shat
tered the administration's confidence
in Carranza. Keports that American
troops entered Mexico with the consent
and cooperation of vie facto govern
ment soldiers did much to convince the
White House that Carranza controls the
situation.
The greatest danger is from peons
who cannot be reached through ordin
ary channelcs, and who will not see the
official statement that the American
expedition is not an "invasion."
White House feeling today was that
the present crisis will determine Car
ranza 's control over his forces. One
prominent unvernment official said:
!'VV;U n u-.tul.' 'o atnrt I'flrpnnTa ncr"it
to land Villi before we reach him.
That's the hope, any how." ,
Americans at Guzman doubted that
the Villistas had heard of the expedi
tion, as outlaw bands were still lin
gering in the vicinity of Casas Grandes.
They said a Carranza censorship had
been in effect suice the Columbus raid
to prevent any news of American plans
filtering into the interior.
Mystery surrounds General Persh
ing's whereabouts. It was increased
when he was reported personally com

32 TROOPERS STOOD OFF
800 OF VILLA'S BANDITS
Commander Claims American
Soldiers Are Best Rifle
Shots In the World
San Antonio, Texas, Mar. 16. Uncle
Sam won the first lap in the gigantic
"hare and hounds" chase in which
Frnacisco Villa's life or person is grand
prize.
Army headquarters sentiment was ju
bilant today. Major General Fred
Funston expressed great satisfaction at
the success of his initial movement in
getting two columns safely into Mexi
co. Tension noticeable for days past
was appreciably easier.
Brigadier General John J. Pershing's
report explicitly stated that the atti
tude of Carranzista troops was all that
could be asked.
Constitukiionalist soldiers were de
tailed to work beside Americans in the
dangerous scouting ahead of the main
body. Funston authorized Pershing to
employ Mexicans for that duty. If
Villi counted on defections from Cnr
ranza's ranks, he lost again.
That American soldiers arc still the
best rifle shots in the world was the be
lief Funston expressed after receiving
his first detailed report of fighting at
Columbus. Sixty-seven Mexicans were
killed on tho American side.
" When you consider that tho attack
was a snrprise delivered in the darkest
hour of night just before dawn nud that
our men were aroused from their sleep
by the assault, the result is remark
aide," said Funston. "I estimate the
total number of Mexiens killed on
both sides of the border nt 150. Once
during the pursuit when tho Americans
were 12 miles over the line, 32 troop
ers stood off 800 Villistas. It was
splendid."
Enlistment Stations
Will Be Opened Soon
Washington, March 10. For the pur
pose of recruiting the United States
regular army up to the full strength
authorized by congress, the war de
partment announced today many new
enlistment Btations would be opened
and business would be resumed at 150
bureaus which had been temporarily
closed.
Recruiting stations are to be immedi
ately established in Los Angeles, San
Diego, Portland, Eugene, San Francisco,
Chico, Oakland, Stockton, Sacramento,
Tacoma and Spokane If stations are
already open in these cities branches
will be established there soon and the
present location will be enlarged.
manding a third column said to be
crossing the bonier south of llachita.
Pershing accompanied the soldiers from
Columbus to the border, and was then
rumored to have gone back and started
for llachita. All movements, of troops
and commanders were hidden, however,
by the strongest censorship in Ameri
ca's history.
Despite stories of threatened rebel
lions, General Gavira, constitutionalist
commandant at Juarez, announced that
all Carranzistas from Casas Grandes
and the Galeana districts had been or
dered to co-operate with the American
expedition. Gavira stated the services
of defacto government soldiers bad
been utilized by the Americans who
were using them for scouts and guides.
Gavira issued an official notice to
Carranzistas that the Americans were
not hostile to the de facto government,
and that they were merely trying to
round up nil Villistas.
It was reliably learned that the first
destination of the American expedition
is Cisas Grandes. Army men said it
would bo several days before they
reached that district. Villa was last
reported terrorizing ranchers in the vi
cinity. Young Hurst, the bishop's son, le
dared the Vililstas were murdering and
burning, but that Mormons were mere
ly concentrated at Person and Chihua
hua City, and that they had not been
molested up to the time he departed.
Colonel Slocum's column is expected
to reach Guzman tonight or tomorrow,
llodd's men are looked for at Dubian
on Friday afternoon.
Chief Obstacle
Remoyed When German
Admiral Von Tirpitz Quit
Washington, March lli. The resig
nation of Grand Admiral Von Tirpitz
as head of the German navy has re
moved tho chief obstacle to an adjust
ment of German-American relations, in
tho opinion of; well informed men to
day. This is a triumph not only for
Chancellor Von Hollweg, but for
American diplomacy. The firm stand
of the American administration in the
armed merchant controversy is be
lieved to- have figured in the reasons
behind the resignation of the chief ex
ponent of the so-called " f rightfulness"
advocated by many German leaders.
Tho resignation is accepted as an
indication that Germany will back

Commercial Club Backs
Mennonite Hospital
The Commercial club at its regular
monthly meeting last night went on rec
ord as endorsing the location in thit
city of a Mennonite hospital and den
cotiess home and of lending its moral
support. This means that T. B. Wede1
of American Falls, Idaho, may return
to Salem and with the aid of the Men
onites' of the northwest and additional
financial assistance from the citizens oi
Salem, build a hospital coating from
$20,000 to $25,000.
The only real objection to the build
ing of the hospital was voiced by those
having in charge the Salem hospital, of
it wns felt that to ascriptions to tht
Mennonite institution might interfere
with the proposed new Salem hospital,
in the way of raising money.
Mr. Huckestein speaking for the Sa
lem hospital stated that as won as the
present friendly suit is decided by t
supreme court and tho present site sob'
to the state, the directors hoped to conic
before tho people ut Salem asking Tor
subscriptions in order that with th
$25,000 received for their present lo
cation, a hospital that would be a cred
it to Salem could be erected, one to
cost probably about $50,000.
The general opinion of the club wtv:
that Salem was big enough to invite
outside parties to come here and tl
the erection of a Mennonite Institution
would be a good thing for the city. The
endorsement of the Commercial' ' club
was given and Mr Wcdel will .be so no
tified. (California to Furnish

London, Mar lli. Murderous French
fire from Dead Man's hill cut to pieces
two German regiments attempting to
encircle Bethincourt and halted the

Fnris dispatches claimed today. Caught
in the open, the kaiser's men lost more

French bayonet charge hurled the sur

DUTCH LINER TUBANTIA
TORPEDOED AND SUNK,
NO WARNING IS GIVEN
Amsterdam, Mar. 1(1. Three hours
after a terrible explosion amidship the
Royal .Dutch Lloyd liner Tubantia sank
in the North sea, it was reported here
today.
She carried 87 passengers ami a crew
of 300. All were said to have been
saved.
Though the Tubantia 's captain said
slio might have been torpedoed, reports
at the company offices said she hit a
mine.
The Tubantia was hit at midnight, 12
hours after sailing. A huge hole was
ripped in its Btem. Wireless messages
calling for help immediately flashed
over the sea.
Passengers and crew abandoned the
stricken liner at once, tumbling into
lifeboats while still half asleep. Some
were terrified by the explosion, the
darkness and horror of the moment, but
no panic was reported.
Several Dutch torpedo boats and life
saving craft appeared on the scene at
daybreak, picking up shivering life
boat cargoes.
Only tiio fact that the explosion oc
curred while the Tubantia was near
land prevented heavy casualties, it is
believed.
Two of the Tubantia 'b heavily la
den lifeboats reached a lightship at 11
a. m. today. Thonnh it is possible some
passengers or sailors may have perish

Washington, Mar. lli. Tho greatest
manhunt in history is on.
Vanguards of tiio American expedi
tion against Francisco Villa are already
well inside Mexico today, but officials
expected few results to be reported in
the very meagre news early available.
The Americans .ire somewhere south of
Columbus. Littlo else concerning them
is known.
A race between American and Mex
ican troops to sco which would capture
Villa seemed possible. Casas Grande
promised to bo tho battle ground. The
most authentic reports located Villa in
that region.
The strength of the expedition is still
in doubt. General John J. Perilling is
believed to have led about 4,000 men
across tho line. Fifteen hundred morn
probably started last night or will
march today from . Culberson's ranch.
Tho two forces aro expected to .join
near La Ascencion probably tomorrow.
Then they will head through Corralitos
toward Casas Grandes.
