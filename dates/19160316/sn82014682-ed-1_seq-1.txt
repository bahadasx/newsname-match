It Is further reported from Los An

considerably In these Islands daring
the last 12 months, and as a result the

At the head of curative Institutions for little children in Honolulu

are nursed back to health, but must then too often go back to homes where
, want and ignorance thwart even affectionate interest At the Japanese
hospital also tiny children are admitted and cared for. V
Second, and in measure supplementary to this work, is the district visit-
Ing done by the nurses of Palama Settlement, who help and advise moth

Republicans are all at sea this week
regarding the delegation to be sent to
Chicagcv The six-delegate plan and

aroused 'the 4rek of ' some and tho un
easiness of ""others. It l&j f eared -that
six delegates cannot he seated and
one or .two; conservative- Republicans
earnestly, counsel the party not to try
to get them seated.' ; - a
A Republican now out-or politics but
for a long time one of the most active
in the Territory Is . understood to fa
yor sendmgr two-' delegates'and'two
alternates and making fight 'for the
restoration of the former allotment -of
six. This was done a decade ago by
the Republicans and proved; a winner.
as the six were allowed and the allot
ment was maintained,1, until, after th
last national' convention.,: ; i
The 'movement : against-; the six
delegate plan, is getting . so strong
that the" convention "may not be urged
to send six, One plan proposed is that
two 'delegates and two alternates be
sent and an attempt made to seat all
four as regulars. . .i .... ; -
If this plan is followed. Prince Ku
hio' and C. A. Rice probably will be
sent as the delegates. For alternates
there are a. number of aspiring candi
dates. Henry Lyman and W, H." Beera
of Hawaii are both In the running. A.
L. Castle and R. W. Breckons of Oahu
would like to go to Chicago, and H. A.

nossfbilitv. "

One of the reports from Hawaii Is
that" the voters of Holstein's district
have no -objection if Prince .. Kuhio
were to be named to represent an out-
stoe island instead of Oahu- the plan
being proposed largely so that anoth
er. OahV delegate" might be available.
