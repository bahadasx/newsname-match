L1EIER TUBANTIA SUNK Iti NORTH
SEA BUT ALL ABOARD ARE S
Amsterdam, Mar. 16. Three hours
after a terrific explosion amidships,
the Itoyal Dutch-Lloyd liner Tuban-
tia sank In the North" sea, It was re
ported here today.
She carried 87 passengers and a
crew of 300 men. All, were said to
have been saved. i
Though the Tubantla'a captain said
she might have been torpedoed, re
ports at the company's offices said
she hit a mine. :
The Tubantla was hit at midnight,
12 hours after sailing. ' A huge hole
was ripped in Its stern. Wireless
messages calling for help Immediate
ly flashed over the sea.
Passcngora and crew abandoned
the" stricken Hner at once, tumbling
Into lifeboats while still halt asleep.
Some were terrified by the explosion,
the darkness and horror of the mo
ment, but no panic was reported. ,
Several Dutch torpedo boats and
life-saving craft appeared on the
sceno at daybreak, picking up shiv
ering lifeboat cargoes., Only the fact
that tho explosion occurred while the
Tubantla was hear land prevented
heavy casualties, It Is believed.
Two of the .Tubantla'a heavily
laden lifeboats reached a lightship at
11 a. m. today. Though It Is pos
sible some passengers or sailors may
have perished during the excitement,
Pres. Wilson Hopes Tiat the
Bandit Chieftain Outlawed
hy Twd Naficns Elay Be
Captured by the Mexicans
, Washington Mar. 16. President
Wilson hopes that General Carranza
will capture Francisco Villa.
The administration today made no
effort to conceal the satisfaction it
would give to have Carranza bag
Villa before the Americans can reach
him. . .
Villa's raid on Columbus nearly
shattered the administration's con
fidence in Carranza. Reports that
American troops entered Mexico with
the consent and co-operation of de
facto government soldiers did much
to convince the White House that
Carranza controls the situation'
The greatest danger Is from peons
who can not be reached through or
dinary channels,' and who win not
see the official statement that the
American expedition Is not an "in
vaslon." . ".
.White House feeling today waa that
the present crisis will determine Car
ranza's control over hit forces. One
prominent official said:
"With a week's start, Carranza
ought to. land Villa before we can
reach him. That's the hope, any
how." ; '

price of sugar will advance 15 cents
more tomorrow, it was announced
here today. This makes a total Jump
of65 cents per 100 pounds within
three weeks.
Three factors, wholesalers say,
combine to cause the rise. They are:
A combination of Biigar interests in
Cuba, heavy foreign buying, and a
short crop In Hawaii. ,
the company's advices said all hands
were saved.
The cargo's value Is unknown.
Three Americans were aboard the
liner. Therefore, it is understood,

tigate rumors that she was torpedoed.
The American correspondent of the
Central News says he was now certain

without warning.
Amsterdam, Mar. 16. The big
Dutch liner Tubantla today was re
ported to have struck a mine and

HUNT FOR VILLA IS
E
1
Washington, Mai1. 16. -The great
est man-hunt in history is on.'
Vanguards of the American expe
dition against Francisco Vina are al
ready well Inside Mexico today, hut
officials expected few results to be
reported In the very meagre news
early available.
The Americans are somewhere
south of Columbus, K. M: Little else
concerning them is known.
A race between American and
Mexican troops to see which would
capture Villa seemed possible. Casas
Grandes promised to be the battle
ground. " The most authentic reports
located Villa In that region.
The strength of the expedition is
still In doubt. General John
Pershing is believed to have led abont
4,600 men across the line. ; Fifteen
hundred more probably started last
night, or win march today from Cul
berson's ranch.
The two forces are expected to Join
near La Ascension, probably tomor
row. Then they will head throneh
Corralitos toward Casas Grandest
A brigade at EI Paso awaited the
signal to march. When it is to leave
has not been disclosed. It Is thought
its departure may be considerably de
layed. ..El Paso, Juarex and vicinity
are believed honeycombed with VII
Hsta sympathizers. ; Prevention of a
Mexican uprising In EI Pasd must be
given consideration by the American
commanders.

citly stated that the attitude of Car
ranza troops was all that could be
asked.. .. , C'.
Constitutionalist soldiers were de
tailed to work beside Americans in
the dangerous scouting ahead of tbe
main body.1: Fnnston authorized Per
ishing to employ Mexicans for that
duty. If Villa counted on defections
from Carranxa's ranks, he lost again.
That American soldiers are still the
best rifle Bhots in the world, waa
the belief Funston expressed after re
ceiving his first detailed report of
fighting at Columbus. Sixty-seven '
Mexicans were killed on the Ameri
can side. ' s .
"When you consider that the at
tack was a surprise delivered In the
darkest hour of night. Just before
dawn, and that our men were arous- ,
ed from their sleep by the assault,
the result is remarkable," said Fun
ston. I estimate the total number
of Mexicans killed on both sides of
the border at 150. Once during the
pursuit when the Americans were 12
miles over the line, S2 troopers stood
off 800 Villlstas. It was splendid."
