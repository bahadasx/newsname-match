Russia and their bitter reeling over tho

No fear is felt' by German officials
that the newest allied diplomatic plan

Censure Belgian Cardinal
ROME, March 11 Despite the reti
cence of the ,'Vatlcan, It Is known that
the Pope has determined to refuse the
demand of Germany to blame Cardinal
Mcrcler, of Belgium, for the publication
of charges of atrocities by the Germans
In Belgium. The Pope, It Is said, U
convinced these charges are well
founded. S
On this account Germany has now
been warned that the Holy See will in
sist that the Inviolability of Cardinal
Morcler be respected, also that of his
bishops In Belgium. The freedom of the
apostolic ministry Is not limited, since
thoy are In duty bound to protect their

The Pope's warnings, it is feared, will
not be heeded by Germany, which haa
threatened reprisals against the bishops.

American Colonics in Flight From Sonora

Charge Commander With Selling-Out to

SAN ANTONIO, March 16. Grave apprehension i$
felt by army heads over the border situation.
"Extremely acute" is the way General Funston de
scribes it.
Frantic appeals are coming in for protection from
points'all along the border.
All reports from tfie interior tell of Americans fleeing
to the international line for safety. .
The colony at Nacoari, in northern Sonora, and Tor
reon, in Coahuila, headed by Consul Williams, have de
rided to flee.
The..sltuatiQji opnpsitd Doughs is jegardedatjhead
4uarieFS here as paYtfcuiarly serious. GeneraTdalle's and
the- Carranzlsta garrison there are aggressively anti-Amer-'
ican, if is reported.
Carranza soldiers mobilized at Cabullona, eighteen
miles south of Douglas, are reported to have informed
Gov. E. P. Calles, of Sonora,
Americans.
Presidio, Tex., opposite which point a Carranza zr
rison mutinied under Colonel Rojas, the Carranza cji
mander, is another dange rspot.
COMMANDER FRIENDLY TO UNITED STATES.
Near Brownsville the local Carranza commander fs
friendly to Americans and is said to have control over his
troops.
Whether there will be serious clashes between Amer
ican soldiers and Carranzistas depends upon the degree of
control Carranza commanders are able to exert over their
men. , .
' To secure additional protection for border citiel
against sporadic attacks which may occur at any point
along the thousands of miles of border, officials here be?
lieve the War Department will shortly advise the calling
out of the National Guard in the three States affected.
General Funston at noon said the only word received
from General Pershing was a "strength" report, outlining
the forces under his command and their risposition. Fun
ston refused to make this report public.
It was reported at Fort Sam Houston today that mil
itary forces many times larger than those under Pershing
may shortly be involved in the Mexican campaign.

from Columbus to San Antonio headquarters, arrange
