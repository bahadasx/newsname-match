War Will be Between J apan

Berlin, Feb. 9. Gcnmins be
lieve the next great war will be
foujrlit between theUnited States
and Japan, with Holland possibly
on America's side.
Nowhere in America excepting
perhaps on the Pacific Coast is
there such lively discussion of a
Japanese-American conflict as in
Germany. Germans believe war
between the two countries inevit
able because Japan wants the
Philippines and i-t restless under
American immigration Jaws.
On a recent day when the Lusi
tania negotiations were reported
to have reached a critical point
the Berlin papers printed a dis
patch declaring Japan had sent
the United States a veiled ultima
tum demanding that Japanese
citizens be allowed to land in
America, without restrictions. Im
mediately the report spread that
the United ' States would back
down on the Lnsitania question.
"Germany is going to sell
Japan all the arms and ammuni
tion she wants if Japan and Amer
ica go to war,' said one German
officer.
Holland, according to best in
formation obtainable here, fears
that on the same da v the JaDanese

Popularity of B. & L. Associations.
In the evidence of the deserving
popularity ot the Building and
Loan Associations of this state,
with both the borower and in
vestor, we will quote a statement
from a speech made before the
State League of Building and
Loan Associations, held at St.
Joseph, Missouri, September 24
and 25, 1915, by S. T. Gresham
of Springfield, a former state su
pervisor of Building and Loan
Associations : ,
"Six years ago we had 127
Building and Loan Associations
in Missouri with combined assets
of $9,000,000. Now we have 160
Associations, with total assets of
$20,000,000. A doubling of assets
in a period of six years is a
growth that should mean some
thing to those seeking a safe,
profitable savings institution."

Wc call attention of our read
ers to the announcement of Henry
V. l'oague of Clinton in Henry
county as a candidate for the nom
ination of Circuit Judge of the
2!)th Judicial District to succeed
Judge C. A. Calvird, the present
incumbent, subject to the action
of the Democrats of Bates, Ben
ton, Henry and St. Clair, the four
counties comprising the district,
at the primary election to be held
on August 1st,
Mr. l'oague is a graduate of the
Law Department of the State Un
iversity at Columbia and was ad
mitted to practice by the Supreme
Court at Jefferson City in 1892.
Shortly after his admission he re
moved from the farm in Benton
county where he was born and
grew to manhood, to Clinton and
soon built up a .lucrative prac
tice. J
Mr. l'oague has served as pros
ecuting attorney of bis adopted
county eight years, having been
first nominated and elected in
1898 and re-elected in 1900, and
after an interyal of six years he
was again elected in 1908 and re
elected in 1910. During his in
cumbency of this office he pros
ecuted several hundred cass and
gained a reputation as a vigorous
prosecutor of the criminal law
second to non( in the State.
He is in the very prime of life
being forty-seen years of age,
and has long been recognized as
one of the leading lawyers of the
Henry County bar. And if suc

for the last forty-five years. .
Wot only is Mr. l'oague an able

gressive citizen, always ready to -
give a helping hand to any one m
need, and is a Democrat who be
lieves in the principles 6f his
party, that the will of .the major
ity should be ubheld and respects
ed. Should he fail in securing the
nomination he will give his suc
cessful opponent the same undi
vided support that he would have
expected whether his personal,
ambition is realized or not.
Mr. l'oague vlill visit several
counties in the district arid meet
as. many of the voters personally
as possible before the primary
date of August 1st. X
