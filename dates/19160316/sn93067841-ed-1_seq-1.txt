AMERICANS CROSS BORDER.
Expect Mexican Aid In Operations
against Villa.
Washington, March 13:?The Uni.
ted States Government entered into
a formal agreement with the de
facto Government of Mexico today
under which American troops will
cross the border to hunt down
Villa and his bandits with the expectation
of hearty co-operation
from the Carranza forces.
Secretary Lansing made puplic
the text of a note accepting Gen
Carranza's proposal for a reciprocal
arrangement between the two Governments
and announcing that the
United States held this arrangement
to be now in force and binding upon
both parties. Gen Funston will
carry out his task under this agree-j
ment.
Official announcement was await-1

had crossed the border. Plans for
the troop movements have gone
ahead without regard to the diplo- j
matic exchanges
Mr Lansing also made public aj
statement issued in the name of
President Wilson reiterating that
every step being taken by the Ad-,
ministration was based on the deliberate
intention to preclude the possibility
of armed intervention in
Mexico.
The statement follows:
"In order to remove any misap-j
prehension that may exist either in
the United States or in Mexico the i
President has authorized me to give
in his name the public assurance
that the military operations now in ,
contemplation by this Government
will be scrupulously confined to the
object already announced and that
in no circumstances will they be j
l
suffered to infringe in any degree j
upon the sovereignty of Mexico or
develop into intervention of any
kind in the internal affairs of our
sister Republic.
"On the contrary, what is now being
done is deliberately intended to
preclude the possibility of intervention."

VILLA AND BANDITS
RAID D S TERRITORY
KILL SEVENTEEN AMERICANS.
FIRE TOWN. AND ESCAPE.
FOLLOWED BY U S TROOPS.
Columbus, N M, March 9:?Francisco
Villa, outlawed Mexican bandit,
raided United States territory
today. With 500 men he attacked
Columbus, N M, killed seventeen
Americans and fired many buildings
before he was driven back across
the international border.
Not less than 250 troopers of the
13th United States cavalry followed
the Villa bandits into Mexico. Reports
late today to Col Slocum, commanding
American troops here,
stated that Villa had made a stand
five miles south of the border where
spirited fighting was in progress.
In this engagement a private was
killed and Capt George Williams,
adjutant of the 13th cavalry, was
wounded.
The small detachment of troopers
under Major Frank Tompkins and
Elmer Lindsley, fighting dismounted,
made a determined stand against
the renewed Villa attack, and at
last reports were holding their
ground.
The raid on American territory
proved costly to the bandit chieftain.
The bodies of eighteen bandits,
including Pablo Lopez, second
in command, had been gathered and
burned before noon and troopers
reported an undetermined number
of dead still lying in the brush.
Led to the attack under the slogan
"Death to the American,"
Villa followers foucrht with desDera
tion. Just before dawn they crept
along ditches skirting the United
States cavalry camp and reached
the sleeping men, firing heavily.
The first volley brought American
troopers into almost an instant action.
While a portion of the raiders
engaged the cavalrymen others

began applying the torch and shooting
American civilians who ventured
from the buildings. Lights in
homes and public buildings immediately
became targets for snipers
posted at Villa's direction. Other
bandits creeping close to American
homes enticed a number of civilians
into the open with English spoken
invitations. A number of fatalities
j are attributed to this ruse.
Store were looted, oil was poured
' unnn frame structures and the
! match applied by still other bandits.
; The postoffiee was raided, but the
; looters got on!> one small registered
package.
Many civilians barricaded theml
selves in their homes and tired at j,
the Mexicans as they darted through |
the streets. The fighting in the.
town ended almost as suddenly as it i
began. Less than two hours after 1
the first shots were heard Villa's'
buglers sounded the retreat and the !
raiders began a disorderly flight, !
closely followed bv American troopers.
