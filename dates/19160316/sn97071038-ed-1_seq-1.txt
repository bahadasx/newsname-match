COUNTY SCHOOL NOTES f
Entertainment Featuring Costume
Drills and Plays Presented to
Crowded House.
Many line entertainments have
been given by the students and pupils
of the Heppner schools in recent
years, but alter hearing the program
of the grade classes through last
Friday evening It is very hard to re
frain from saying that that was the
best ever. We are ever prone to be
lieve that the world Is growing better
day by day and ofttimes In support of
that belief give credit where credit
is not always due. In this instance
we are supported by the unusual care
and preparation and the consequent
performance of the young folks. Each
and every one had his or her part so
carefully committed that there was a
total lack of embarrassment and con
fusion which so often marks an en
tertainment of this nature. The work
of preparation had been long and
tedious for teacher and pupil alike,
but the final culmination of their effort-repaid
them fully for their la
bors. The varied program was full of
' Interest from start to finish. Each
number was properly costumed
where costumes were necessary and
the little maids and little gentlemen
were charming and gallant in their
respective stations. Especially was
this true In the drills and plays of
the little tots.
The program opened with a "Flag
Song" by the pupils of the second
grade. This was followed by a
French Minuet by sixteen primary
jJupils in colonial costumes. Those
taking part were: Kathleen Mona
han, Mary Farley, Laura Hall, Mar
garet Barratt, Margaret Smith. Hazel
McDaid, Louise Thomson, Crystal
Roberts, James Monahan, John Ed
ward Farley, Evert Boten, Wesley
Brookhouser, Onez Parker, Kenneth
Merritt, Marvin Brown, Roy Quack
enbtisli . , ' ,
Elaine Sigsbee gave a reading,
"The Runaway Boy."
Childhood plays were recalled to
many older hals when the primary
grade presented "Three Little Pigs."
The little folks were right at home
In this play and it was amusing to
watch the manner in which the little
"pigs" sought shelter from the wolf
in their Imaginary houses. The cast
of this play follows:
Louise Thomson Mother Pig
Anna Gentry 1st Little Pig
Muriel Cason. -2nd Little Pig
Gordon Bissett -3rd Little Pig
Fred Knaus Man with Straw
Laurence Copenhaver Man with Twigs
Eldon Gentry Man with Bricks
Onis Grogan The Wolf
Marvin Wightman Merchant at the
Fair
Lovell Lucas warmed the hearts of
local Scots in her character song and
dance.
The ribbon drill by twenty-four pu
pils from the second and third grades
probably elicited the most favorable
comment of any number on the pro
gram. The little girls In their dainty
gowns and the boyB in white linen
Ruits presented a beautiful stage pic
ture and the drill was carried out
without a hitch. Those taking part
were: Mary Patterson, Francis Gen
' try, Irene Wattenburger, Leslie Neel,
Vawter Parker, Mary Case, Helen
Siebels, Ralph "Boyd, Margaret Ma
honey, Alton Osmin, Lewis Osmin,
Glenna Kirk, Crockett Sprouls, Fern
Johnson, Marie Knaus, Lucile Mc
Duffee, Melba Chidsey, James Hayes,
Marguerite Hisler, Neva Brown,
Stanley Minor, Stanley Williams,
Tom Wells, Donald Bowker.
"The Brownie Song," by pupils of
the third grade was a quaint charac
ter song. With the tall pointed hel
mets the little brownies made a real
istic appearance and their funny little
bows were very amusing.
Mary Clark entertained with a
piano solo.' t
A short play, "Books We Love,"
was given by seventeen pupils from
the fifth grade. Two children, John,
(Charles Church) and Mary, (Ethel
Mlkesell) being left alone to spend
the evening, fell asleep and dreamed
nt hnnk friends they loved. As each
i-haracter anpeared on the stage Ber-
til Slitsbee read a short paragraph
from the story it represented. Owing
to a continual disturbance in the
back part of the house it was difficult
for many to hear what the young
lady read but we were able to under
stand some of it by the representa
tion of characters as follows:
Heidi Cleone Andrews
LlttleLame Prince Roy McDuffee
Peter Pan Austin Smith
Alice In Wonderland Willetta Barratt
Robin Hood .Leonard Schwarz
Blue Beard Mvln Smith
Red Riding Hood-Margaret Woodson
By Supt. S. E. Notson.

wife. A new heating and ventilating
plant has been placed in the high

In use in the other room. Several
new framed pictures have been
placed upon the walls. A new water
fountain has been Installed. The
playground has been leveled at con
siderable expense. An excellent lot
of play apparatus has been provided,
consisting of swings, see-saws, giant
stride, horizontal bar, slide and fly
ing rings. A basket ball equipment
is also included. The pupils make
good use of the apparatus. A new
compound microscope has been add
ed to the laboratory. A new four
burner oil stove has been purchased
for the domestic science class. ThU,
with the other equipment, enables
the girls to do some excellent work.
On baking day, the class find the de
mand for their products far greater
than they are able to supply. Both
rooni3 of the Irrigon school will
reach the standard. Two evening

In District No. 25 J. A. Gibbons
is still at the helm. The windows
have been re-arranged so as to do
away with the cross lights. The heat

by a Smith heater. I noted that the

recitation work. The floor is kept in
fine condition. It has been oiled, and
sweeping compound is used in clean
ing it. The sweepng compound costs
about $2.00 a year.
Mrs. M. E. Clark teaches n District
No. 39. The grounds if this school
have been enlarged, giving ample
play space. I arrived just at noon,
and the teacher and pupils were en
joying a hot lunch. They have solved
the problem of the hot lunch for a
rural school. Mrs. Clark thinks it is
an advantage to the work, aside from
the training the older girls receive in
preparing the lunch. A new encyclo
pedia has been purchased recently.
This school is doing some excellent
industrial work.

having a broken bone in his shoulder
wired together. About a month ago
he consulted Drs. Winnard and Alii

Building Large Shearing Plant.
A sheep shearing plant unequalled
by any in the country is now being
built at Echo, by the wool growers of
this neighborhood. The new plant
will consist of a large permanent
building of substantial construction,
arranged so that a large number of
sheep can be handled easily.
The building is to have a front of
100 feet and will be ISO feet in
depth. Through the center there is
to be a shearing deck 36x80, onto
which the sheep are driven for shear
ing. Shutes carry the animals to the
ground floor after clipping. A belt
conveyor runs down the center of the
deck to carry the fleece to the pack
ing machine. Inspection bins will
be along the side.
Heretofore the Echo plant, housed
in rough temporary sheds, has shear
ed from 60,000 to 70,000 sheep ev
ery spring. The increased facilities
provided by the new plant will allow
of handling a much larger number.

ploy 50 or 60 men. A cook house,
20x40, for the shearers, is now being
built. Echo News.
