THE COOK COUNTY NEWS-H
liRSHD NAHMS. CDMC COUNTY, MINN., HARE 16. 1916-
CQIINTY ELECTION THIS YEAR?
Appeal to Suprene Court Would
Probably Necessitate Election
of Count} Officers.
We note considerable comment in
the papers of the state in regard to
the constitutionality of the four year
term for county officers.
In the Small wood-Windom de­
cision Judge Hal
lam turned aside to
remark that "As a matter of fapt
county officers in every county of
the state today are holding under a
statute fixing their term at four years
from the first -^fonday in January,
1915, and until their successors are
elected and qualified. This terin
exceeds the constitutional limit fixed
by section 9, article 7 of the consti­
tution, which permits no hold-over
at all. But it has never been con­
sidered that such statutes are void
xcept as to the excess over the
constitutional limit."
There are those who doubt the
omission of the words '*countv of­
ficers" from the last clause exempts
them from the provision regarding
the biennial election, since they a"e
mentioned in the first clause. And
the last sentence of the section says
that "all state, county and other
officers elected at the general elec­
tion whose terms will otherwise ex­
pire on the first Monday in January,
1886, shall hold and continue in
such offices until the first Monday
in January, 1887".
Should the other Justices hold
with Judge Hallam in this opinion,
find an appeal be made, a county
election would be necessary this
year. We do not believe that there
is any seutiment iu this county de­
siring this law attacked.
Special for St. Patrick's Day.
There will be a special program
of illustrated songs, orchestra selec­
tions, in addition to ti picture show
on Friday night. Six reels will be
shown in all and the length of the
program makes it necessary to start
the show at 7:30. See the program
on the inside sheet oF this issue.
This will be well worth seeing.
FOR ADVANCE ON TREBIZ0ND
Russia Preparing to Use Captured
Pert as Naval Base.
London, March 11.—Russia is pre­
paring to use the recently captured
harbor of Riza as a naval base for the
advance on Trebizond, which is thir­
ty-five miles distant, according to Pe
trograd dispatches. Riza is an ideal
harbor and offers ample shelter and
anchorage. In this way the Russians
will have the advantage of satisfac­
tory communications by sea, while the
Turks are handicapped by incredibly
bad land communications. The Rus­
sians have complete mastery in the
Black sea and are keeping ceaseless
watch on the Bosporus.
FORTY-FIVE LIVES ARE LOST
Two British War Vessels Strike Mines
and Sink.
London, March 11.—The British tor
pedo boat destroyer Coquette and tor­
pedo boat No. 11 have been sunk by
striking mines, it is officially an­
nounced.
The announcement says the number
of casualties in connection with the
sinking of the warships was forty
five.
Turk Troops Go to West Front.
Odessa, March 12.—It is reported
here that Germany has given formal
assurance to Turkey that she will not
make peace without compensation to
Turkey and that Turkey has consent­
ed to send Turkish troops to assist
the Germans on the Western front.
Several engineering regiments have
been withdrawn from Asia Minor to
Constantinople.

The Tofte Community Club met
last Saturday evening at the town
hall. The question of establishing
a semi-graded school at Tolte was
discussed and
l)r
unanimous vote the
school board was asked to perfect
plans for such a school. By this
change the school at Tofte will, in
addition to the usual eight grades,
give two years high school as well
as manual training and domestic
science. It is also proposed to give
evening school for the new-comers
and others who are in need of knowl
idge of the English language.
Reservation Notes
Mr. A. L. Ellquist., a prominent, citi
zen of Hovland and a member of the dis­
trict school board, attended the play last
Saturday evening. He visited the
school of this_plac§ before returning.
The late snowstorms Lave not only
retarded progress improving farm
lands, but has heaped up amass of soft
sloppy snow to a depth that is a fright,
and terror, to the hardy woodsman as
well as the tenderfoot shoppers. Set­
tlers are seen pacing the floors iu their
homes, like unto caged lions, so eager
are they to be at their work. But the
promise is to the faithful and we feel
safe to predict that in a short time we
wiU have spring in reality as well as in
season. No doubt, when the suowstarts
again it will go with a.rapidity that will
astonish both old snttlers and new com­
ers.

The people of the community are look­
ing forward to the election, Tuesday,
the 14th, with interest. The Reserva­
tion is destined to play an important
part in the political drama of Cook
county.
N. P. Parsons, represents the Cook
County News-Herald, our local paper,
and he welcomes news, advertisements
and subscriptions from the citizens of
this section of the county. {If yon ap­
preciate bis efforts in behalf of'the com­
munity, manifest it by giving him your
subscription.
Geo. Bnkovich, when leaving the club
Saturday evening, the Iltb, made a mis­
take carrying off an overcoat~belongmg
to another and leaving his own. He did
not discover the mistake till he had left
the club hall far behind and would not
have noticed it then had he not needed
his mittens which he had left in the
pockets of his coat. Geo. will be glad
to return the coat and receive his own.
The dramatic play given by the Farm­
ers' Club was a grand success. It
proved to be an all star performance.
The music furnished by Miss Elsie Net—
terlund, Mr. and Mrs. Samuel Hoyt was
equally as great. Everybody was over
pleased, and seemed well compensated
for the trip through the deep snow.
The empty coffers were partially filled,
but, no doubt, will be heavily drawn
upon to meet the needs of the club.
The Fsirmers' club of this place is do
ing a great work, and arousing increased
interest in the communities betterment
Through this organization the farmers
are enabled to purchase the best seeds
on the market at a great reduction in
price, besides by ordering in a bulk will
economize in freight charges. The
question of buildiug a public dock will
be considered at the April meeting, also
arguments for and against organizing
this territory into a town will be pre­
sented. Where so many are laboring in
the vineyard of advancement, it is in­
vidious to particularize, but the labors
of the Koberts' Bros., Mr. and Mrs. Sam­
uel Hoyt, Albert Enerson, Wm. Taylor,
and Miss E. Linquist are especially
fruitful.
