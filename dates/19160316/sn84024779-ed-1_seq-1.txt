Meeting
Baby's Health embraces a vast
field of scientific principles. To
discuss it well, would require
three or four hours. It is the pur
pose of this lecture to crystalize
some of the important facts and
set them forth in a thirty minute
discussion and to emphasize the
importance of a careful study of
the development of the brain and
nervous system of the infant.
Infanoy is the period of life
which extends from birth to the
age of about two and a half years
or until the eruption of the first
teeth.
