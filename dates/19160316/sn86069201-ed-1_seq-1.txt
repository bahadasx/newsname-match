WAGON LOAD OF MONEY.
That hemp in this county is higher
than the proverbial ''cut's back" and
perhaps higher than was ever known in

load, just an ordinary farm wagon load,
which he haa sold to Spears and Com
pany, of this city, that brought him the
sum of $443.00. We call this "going
some".
GOING AFTER VILLA.
Gen. Funston lasc night tightened the

hours, the main armv to follow later.
Meanwhile Carranza Boldiera, believed
to number 15,000, are making strenuous
efforts to run duwn and capt'irn Villa.

They take this means of thanking
their patrons of the past and aolicitat
ing'lheir future trade. As the old firm
wishes to wind up their business at
once they earnestly ask all those In
debted to them to call and settle their

BOOT LEGGERS
RECEIVE HEAVY
BLOW IN
LICCOURT.
JUDGE FRISBIE HAKES FINE
BEGINNING AS POLICE
JUDGE.
The officers of the city of Lancaster
have been planning for some time to
make a drive against the boot leggers
of the town, who apt always hard to
catch. Policeman, 0. Buck and city
attorney, J. E' Robinson, have been
laying the wires for several days and
on last Friday four warrants were sworn
out against Ed Anderson, two against
Tommie Adams and one against Less An
derson, all colored all of whom are known
to be the chief boot leggers of the
town. The Police Court room was
crowded on Saturday morning to see
Judge Friable hold his first important
trials. After the evidence was heard
In all the cases and the attorneya had
submitted the cases for the judgment
of the Court, His Honor. Judge Frisbie,
pronounced his judgments against the
defendants in about the followingwords:
"We have tried thq four cases against
Ed Anderson, two against Tommie
Adams and one against Less Anderson
upon the charge of selling liquor il
legally in the town of Lancaster. I
have considered the evidence on both
sides in all of the cases and I am con
vinced beyond any doubt that each of
the defendants have been proven guilty
upon all the charges in all the cases.
It shall b e my earnest effort
to see that no Innocent person Is con
victed in this Court while I am Judge,
but at the same time I am determined
that ail forms of violation of law shall
be stopped in this city. As to the pun
ishment of the defendants upon the
charges it is my belief that persons who
engage In boot legging of whiskey or
as Is commonly called 'running a blind
tiger' do so with full knowledge of the
strong and over-whelming sentiment of
the people against their acts, in tact
they do so with the intention of defying
the law and the wishes of the whole
community. It is my judgment that
only severe punishment will bring such
offender to observing the-taw- and the
right way of living. Believing the
defendants guilty and considering the
nature of the olfense committed by
them, the punishment in each case
against each defendant will be One
Hundred Dollars, (1100.), and cost and
imprisonment in each cue in the Coun
ty Jail for thirty days." After the
trial Judge Frisbie was the recipient of
a shower of congratulations for the
manner in which he had conducted the
first important trials in his Couir
Those who heard the trials were fully
convinced that boot legging will soon
cease in this city.
WOOL PRICES SOARING
BECAUSE OF THE WAR
Demand Is Greater Than In Recent Years
And Increased Offerings Means Many
More Dollars For Farmers.
The customary $500,000 wool crop of
the Bluegrass promises to attain a value
of at least $700,000 this year, and if the
present upward tendency In the mantel
continues to affect the price list, even
greater returns may be expected, ac
cording to local dealers' estimates.
War conditione have been assigned as
a caufe of the strong tone to the bnsi
ness and a record price may be attained
unless the European conflict should end
or exports be cut dawn for any reason.
Present rates on wool are 34 and 35
cents over the local floors. Dealers are
paying that price for all they can get
and the state of the trade is healthy.
Normally the prices paid to sheep rais
ers is about 25 cents, aid this represents
the average for the past several years.
YOUNG MAN TAKES LIFE
Carroll L. Dndderar Returns Home From
Horse Sales Despondent And
Ends It All.
Carroll L. Djdderar, one ot the best
known young men of Stanford, took his
own life about nine o'clock Thursday
morning at the home of his aunt, Mrs.
George F. Dellorde and Mr. DeBorde.
The young man swallowed about an
eighth of an ounce of strychnine, and
died in a short time afterward, in ter
rible convulsions. II was conscious
almost up to the moment of death, but
gave no reason for the rath act. He
had come home Wednesday night, how
ever, despondent, after spending u
couple of weeks in Lexington, Louis
ville and Frankfort, and it ia believed
that as a result of his condition, his
third was temporarily unbalanced and
he took the fatal step when not at him
self. News of the young man's death was
a surprise and shock In Lancaster aa he
was well known here, having shown
horses at our fairs, being a splendid
rider.
