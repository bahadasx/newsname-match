Many Americans Are Leaving.
I State Department dispatches today
, said Americans in Mexico, particularly
5 in the interior states, were leaving in (
. large numbers either for the United j
States or the lower coast ports, where
better protection was deemed possible
owing to the presence at the latter
points of Carranza troops. Reports
from Mexico City, Nacozari, Tori eon
and other places in Sonora reported the
. departure of Americans.
Consul General Hanna at Monterey
forwarded to the State Department today
a delayed message from Consular

ail Americans had left Torreon for the
I United States. It contained no further
information. Uonsul Williams re-I
I ported he had turned the consulate over

k Designed to Prepare America.
The passage of today's Berlin disJ"
patches by the German censor is regarded
as showing the desire of the
German foreign office to prepare th'
! American people for such a contest in
,n ! : he rcichstag as w as recently seen in
v I Congress between two factions ov#i
the armed ship question.
c Jt is believed that th? contest will
result in probably harsh attacks upon
the I nited States and the German govs'
ernmcnt itself by the von Tirpitz eleii
ment, and for that reason offieials and
f diplomats, i-eading between the lines,
foresee an intention to prepare the

yf ! decision not to offend this eountry
Emperor Presides at Conference.
About a fortnight ago. rt is under- *
| stood, a conference was held in Bet .in
?e | presided over by the emperor himrtif
land attended by Chancellor von Betliff
! mann-Hollweg. Herr von Jagow and
;d | Gen. von Falkenhay n. chief of staff,
^ I and it is believed that Admiral von Til1
! pitz himself was called in. The discusHj
' sion turned on submarine warfare geriv
erally. and particularly upon the attie*
j tude of the t'nited States. Subsequent
events in the American Congress were
' i forecast with remarkable accuracy.
: The general understanding was that
. it was the emperor himself who deti?.
| ed that every effort should he made to
,|T retain tlie friendship of the United
(t [States short of abandoning any prijiiejciples
involving the honoi of tlie Gernl
\ man nation. The result was the rejection
of the proposed extension of sui?t
marine warfare to affect neutral na!
lions. Von Tirpitz's retirement follow
naturally, the rejection of the plans
it- j he had fathered.
_ i It is totalized in Washington thai Berj
lin is now to witness a conflict between
the emperor and a powerful element
ul in the reii-hstag, wrought up 10 a high
pitch of indignation over the ion^
detonation of the von Tirpitz plans.
>y j Opposition in Prussia.
rt J
! Todajs Berlin dispatches, that Herr
:d j von Jagow spurned the adverse crili!
cisin of the ITussian diet, are taken to
je j show that in the c ontest the emperor
e- j may tind himself even in the position
I of antagonism and forceful domination
of ? majority of his own belo\ed
I 'rnssians.
Tue German government is reliably
represented as having no intention of
y j departing from its announced policy ?>f
regarding armed merchantmen of ths
y entente allies as warships. At the
same time it will shape its campaign so
11 as to obviate all possibility of irouble
with the United States and every effort
t will be exerted, it is said, to avoid
e friction with neutrals generallv.
" | Outline of Von Tirpitz Policy.
I The policy which brought about the
j | downfall of von Tirpitz was on* w hich,
e , if entered upon, would have had serious
results for the relations between t?er^
many arid the 1'nited States. it proit
posed tne sinking of all ships. wheth?r
) neutral ?r enemy, bound to or from
e ports of tlreat Britain and her allies.
Kven now . according tol information
reaching here, members of the Tirpitx
e faction, especially in the reichstag. are
contending that dermany is conductI
itig her naval warfare in a manner
e subservient to the w ishes of the United
t- States. Strong efforts, it is indicated.
!- will be put forth to counteract such
a charges and other criticism of a like
nature.
