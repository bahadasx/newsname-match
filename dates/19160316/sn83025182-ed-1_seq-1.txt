An indication that this division had
not yet started, was received in the
report that Brig. Gen. J. J. Pershing,
actively directing the entire expedi

This column consisting of the Sev

THE HAGTT0, March 16.—Resigna
tion of Grand Admiral Von Tirpltz
from command of the German naval
forces, means the end of the attempt
to enforce a ruthless submarine pro
gram, according to reliable advices
received here today.
The news has created great rejoic
ing in those quarters in Berlin anxious
to preserve good relations with Amer
ica. The Von Tirpitz resignation is
considered a personal triumph for
Chancellor Von Bethmann-Hollweg,
advocate of a conciliatory policy to
ward America.
Berlin dispatches today said that
the change in the ministry of marine
was entirely unexpected. It came on
the eve of the opening of a reichstap
cession at which the Von Tirpitz sup
porters planned •wage open war on

ADMIRAL VON TIRPITZ RESIGNED
BECAUSE HIS PLANS FAILED

Program is Expected to
Come to An End.
The chancellor, returning from
army headquarters before Verdun,
brought word to reichstag leaders that
he was strongly supported by the

and Admiral Von Capelle, director of
the administration department of the

with the probability that the appoint
ment will be made permanent.
Reports of Von Tirpltz's illness were
not fabrications, according to reports
brought here. Over-work and anxiety
aggravated by the failure of his plans
had brought the aged marine chief to
the verge of a breakdown.

and awarded a pension.
The official statement issued in
Berlin saying the change at the ma

here as made solely for home con

LONDON. March 16.—A murderous
fire from French artillery on Dead
Man hill cut to pieces two German
regiments which attempted to encircl-j
Bethincourt and halted the Teutonic
offensive west of the Meuse, accord
ing to Paris dispatches today.
The Germans lost more than two
thousand in an engagement lasting
only a few hours. French bayonet at
tacks drove the remnants of the at
tacking forces back to their trenches.
The latest dispatches from Paris re
port a lull in the infantry fighting tn
the Bethincourt region, but announce
that the French have been the aggres
sors in a series of hot skirmishes
around Vatix village and Fort Vaux,
east of the Meuse.
The German assault west of the
Meuse was planned with great cars.
The Germans first bombarded violent
ly, concentrating their fire on a nar
row sector between Bethincourt and
Dead Man Hill. They then attacked
first on the northern slopes of Goose
hill and having been repulsed, made a
furious charge against the French

the white stream of foam, following
in the wake of a torpedo, the passen
gers from the stern reported the tor
pedo flashed by, a few yards astern
of the rudder.
The ship's officers were unable to
quiet the fears of the passengers un
til it was certain the submarine had
been distanced. Captain Dechelles
said.
Ramon J. Janer, American vice con
sul went aboard the Patrla at julsbon
and made an investigation of uie in

Captain Dechelles said the Patrla
will be painted a war color on her
return trip and that he would ask his
government for defensive guns on the
ground that the submarine gave no
warning.

The call may come before end of

Municipal officials of Arliona and
New Mexico towns have made frantic
appeals to General Funston for addi
tional protection, fearing possible
local uprising of part of the resident
Mexicans. In every case General
Funston has pointed out to the local
authorities requests for federal as
sistance must come from the gover
nor at the state wishing it. General
Funston regards the situation along
the border as extremely acute.
The nituation opposite Douglas is
regarded at headquarters here as par
ticularly serious. General Calles and
his men there are aggressively anti
American, it Is reported. Presidio,
Texas, opposite which point a Car
ranza garrison mutinied and assas
sinated Colonel Rojas, the Carranza
commander, is a danger spot. Near
Brownsville, the local Carranza com
mander is friendly to Americans and
Is said to have control over his
troops.
Whether there will be serious
clashes between American soldiers
and Carranzistas, depends upon the
degree of control Carranza command
ers are ablo to exert over their men.

which may occur at any points along

Dutch liner Ttibantia, carrying eighty

sank off North Hinder lightship today,
three hours after she was wrecked by

Though the liner's captain said she
might have been torpedoed, It was re

she struck a mine. The passengers
and crew are reported to have been

The Tubantla, the fastest and larg

hours after leaving Amsterdam for
Buenos Aires. Tho explosion tore a
great hole in the stern and the liner's
wireless immediately began sending
out calls for help.

and crew were put over

Two of the Tubantla's life boats,
loaded with survivors reached North
Hinder lightship at about 11 a. m.
The Dutch steamer Krakatau reports

possible some lives have been lost,
advices to the company's offices ex
pressed the belief that every person
afcoard the liner has been saved. The
value of the liner's cargo is not
