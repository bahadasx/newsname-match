Washington, March 13.?President ^

his heart than keeping the United
States out of war. He was assured

by leaders of the delegation that his
efforts In behalf of peace have been
strongly approved throughout the
country. In reply the president said:
"I can assure you that nothing is 1 {
nearer my heart than keeping this
country out of war, and doing any- ui
thine that the United States can do to Fi
show Its preference for peace and for
justice, and for the things that make ^
it impossible that nations should fight b<
and friendships and fair dealings.
"You may rest assured that it cheers
me very much that you should come ^

WORLD'S LEADING
TOBACCO TOWN
Winston-Salem, N. 0., Now Mauufac- ^
tures More Tobacco Froducta Than
Any ether City in the World. i
Following are extracts from an ad- De
ureas ueuvered by Col. A. D. Watib, A>i
ill
Collector of internal Revenue for the ^
Fifth District of North Carolina, ai m
a smoker given by 'The Twin Ch.? Ni
Clut>, Winston-Salem, February dtn, '
?iyi6;
"Winston-Salem is supplying wuefourth
of aii the chewing and smoking St
tobacco consumed in the United States,
HW
oesides exporting vast quantities to
foreign lands. This statement is taa.eu
from the report of the report of
the Commissioner 01 luiemui xvckuuc ?
for tile first quarter cf Uie present fiscal
'year and from private advices
from Washington, as to the second
quarter, which ended December 31st, ?
inst
"Your city is making one-seventh of
all tobacco products?chewing and
snicking tobacco, cigars, cigarette and
states. Your manufacturers are pay- lo<
ing on an everage about $37,000 a day
revenue taxes to the government and ^
the amount is increasing from mouth Uv
to mouth. When your government hi
building, much the handsomest in the
State, was completed last July at a
cost of $25,000 your newspapers made
the statement that the taxes paid in <ji
your city to Uncle Sam for the first
eight days of its occupancy would pay
for it Since September, it has taken
only a fraction over seven average
days collections here to equal its cost ,
I n.ctaLr Mr firanford has
OU iai uiio nw? f ?
taken ill $206,528.50. I predict that u,
before 1016 shall have ended your av- be
erage weekly payments to the govern- ti(
ment on tobacco will more than pay
for this magnificent building, leaving
the collections for the other fifty-one C
weeks as clear profit to the government
"Winston-Salem is shipping on an
average each day to all parts of this
country and to foreign lands at least _
$150,000 of tobacco products are taken ~
into this statement, than any other C<
city on earth, little or big. Industrially,
she is easily first in North
Carolina, population consedered, first
in America and I believe, in the world;
-socially, a never falling delight to her
friends." tb
