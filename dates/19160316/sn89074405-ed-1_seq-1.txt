MATTER SERIOUSLY
Revision of Munitions work
is Now Under Con
sideration.
London. March 16.—The Earl of
Derby, In replying to a question in
the house of lords yesterday dealt with
the recruiting situation. He admitted
that as time progressed It was. evi
dent that the reserved occupations

minister of munitions and the admir
alty were considering the revision of
the list of munition workers.
"The cabinet is taking the matter
so seriously," he continued, "that I
think they will secure all the single
men they require for the army."
Later on during his remarks be
said:
"To disorganize munition work at
present by withdrawing all-single men
might be doing justice to the married
men at home, but It might be dealing
death to married and single men
fighting at the front."
Lord Derby announced that women
were now being provided for muni

month.

FRST DAY PASSED QUERY
DETAILS ARE CENSORED OUT
San Antonio, Texas, March 16.—The first report
from General Pershing to General Funston stating
that all is going well, was received today at Fort Sam
Houston.
The report dealt with the strength of Pershing's
command, disposition of various units and officers, the
distance of the first day's march and the movements
of Carranza troops. All these details, however, come
under the censorship and were not made public.

SMALLER CHANCE
OF SERIOUS BREAK
EVENING
EDITION
TWBfcVE PAGES—PRICE FIVE CENTS.
General Funston has arranged a direct govern
ment wire to Columbus, New Mexico. At the same
time, it was announced that General Pershing might
make frequent trips between the field forces and Co
lumbus. In this way the commander of the expedi
tionary forces can keep in close touch with the head of
the southern department.
General Pershing's start into Mex
ico without opposition from the
Mexloan forces, and apparently with
out serious disturbance resulting along
the border is the big topic of con
versation at Port Sam Houston, the
headquarters of Major-General Fun
ston.
Ever since he began planning the
expeditionary movement General Fun
ston has paid close attention to the
attitude of Carranza and his follow
ers. When General Pershing wired
yesterday that he had orossed the
border and had been joined by tbe
Carransa forces stationed at Palomas,
Funston evinced great satisfaction.
Shot at UnnfOla
This was heightened when tbe early
reports Indicated that the only vio

Censorship Experiment.
While the primary purpose of the
censorship ordered by Funston wss
to mystify "Villa, it is known that it
is also in the nature of a military ex
periment, partly to determine the at
titude of the American newspapers
and people towards such methods.
That it met without any sort of objec
tion, and was. In many cases, freely
endorsed by the newspapers, was a.
surprise to Funston, who Had said
when he announced his secrecy plans:
"I suppose they'll haul me into court
for this."
Quiet at Tiogatos.
Nogales, Ariz., March 16.—Tran
quility prevailed today on both sides
of the Mexican border in this section.
The first crisis of the excitement
among the Mexicans at the news of
the American march had passed here.
Nogales was heavily patrolled all night
by American troops. Fifty men of the
Carranza garrison remained in the
Mexican town of Nogales. The others,
several hundred strong, have been
withdrawn south over night. They
