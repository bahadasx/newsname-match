Some One Is Attempting to
Stir Them Up to '
Trouble.
(By Associated Preas)
EL PASO, March 1G.?Tho Ameri
can expeditionary force which has
started to capture Pancho Villa alive
or dead, had penetrated about 10 miles
into Mexico, according to most relia
ble reports received here today.
The military censorship which has
been tlghtoned Ita grip on .he border |
for some days permitted practically
nothing but rumors to escape, but It
was fairly well established that the
advance corps o( the American ex
pedition had camped last night in the
heart of the desert which lies between j
the point of entry and the foot hills
of the Sierra Madras, the vast range
of mountains in the fastnesses of
which Villa is believed to have taken
refuge
But the interest of the border in the
American advance was practically ov
ershadowed by the question as to how
the presence of the soldiers of the Unit
ed States on Mexican territory would
be taken by the Carranza military of
ficiate and soldiers,
General Calles, the military gover
nor of Sonora, was the "man of the
hour." His troops variously estimat
ed at from 12,000 to 20,000 men garri
soned the frontier towns and tho im
mediate interior of the section into
which the American soldiers had en
tered. For days reports and rumors
that Calles' troops were disaffected
and bitterly resented the pursuit of
Villa by American Boldiers' have flood
ed the region.
The deflnlte announcement that the
Stars and Stripes have been carried
over the international line by armed
forces increased those rumorB and re
ports to a deluge, out of which It was
almost Impossible to pick whatevei
grains of truth might exist
There seemed no question that a
considerable portion-of Mexican sol
diers and civilians In the north of the
republic were bitterly, hostile to the
action of the United States. The high
er civil and military authorities of the
Carranza government showed every
desire to prevent friction but It Tf
mains doubtful whether they can con
trol the masses of the population la
the northern district who are becom
ing restlesB due to the sedulous pro
paganda against Americans which Is
being carried on among them from un
known sources. , v. ^ ,? %

Syndicate Wants To j
Represent Fairmont
MCKEAND SERVICE COMPANY
REPRESENTATIVE TALKS AT
COMMERCE CHAMBER
The Mclveand Service company's
representative, Mr. Watson, met mem
bers and directors of the Fairmont
Chamber ot Commerce yesterday even
ing, and outlined the plan ot that com
pany in developing towns and business
organizations. The McKennd Service
company, ot Indianapolis, Indiana, is
a sort ot syndicated industrial agent
bureau anil does the industrial agent
work for u number ol cities.
Whllo Mr. Watson's talk was im
pressive and Interesting It is not like
ly that the local chamber will consider
such a proposition very seriously. The
local chamber is well organized and
efficient enough to back up an in
dustrial agent ot its own. it is the
consensus ot opinion of the local mem
bers that an exclusive agent working
for Fairmont alone will accomplish
more than would a bureau such as the 1
McKeand Service . company. -
The' committee that is working on
the industrial agent proposition has
made no report as yet but tho members
are daily gathering data on the ques
tion and are in touch with a number
ot men that might possibly be secur
ed. As soon as the committee is ready
to make a report another meeting ol
the chamber will bo called and some
action will then likely be taken in
tlie matter.

WITH EVANGELIST WHO
MAKES STATEMENT.
PITTSBURGH, March IB?Dr. \V.
W. Hall, evangelist, in his sermon last
night In the South Hills tabernacle,
Knoxville, declared tbo ballrooms to be
a means of breaking up homes. Dr.
Hall's subject w/.a "The Carnival ol
Death, or the Modern Dance." He said
in part:
"There Is not a church in Christlan
dom that is evangelical In spirit., loves
God and has a vision o( Christ that
will not declare against dancing. The
leading authorities ot the Catholic and
Protestant denominations have spoken
against dancing and denounced it as
wrong. Dancing has brought disaster
to many firesides."
