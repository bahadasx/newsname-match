News that certain corporations were
back of his candidacy were answered
last evening by Henry D. Estabrook
presidential candidate, in his address
last evening at the Auditorium which
was attended by 1,000 voters. He
held his audience to the end. Mr
Estabrook is a finished speaker and
an attorney of national reputation. He
came out vigorously for preparedness
scoring the negative policies of the
Wilson administration. As a preface
to his address he made the following
answers to charges circulated by the
LaFollette forces:
Answers Charges.
"Before going into the subject-mat
lor of ruy speech tonight, there is a
personal matter to which 1 wish brief
ly to refer. In the Fargo Daily Corn­
ier-News, of this morning, Wednes
day, March 15th. there is an editorial
which reads as follows:
"This editorial, you observe, men­
tions several questions propounded
to me by the same editor in his Sun
•lay's issue, and which, as he says, I
entirely ignored. If I followed my
own inclinations I should continue to
ignore thorn,, but. I am advised by
those having my interests at heart'
that I hey should be publicly answer­
ed, lest by silence 1 might, seem to ad
mil the truth of the facts insinuated.
"Taking them in order:
"First. I am sorry that there should
he rumors, ugly or otherwise, concern
ing my connection with the American
Telephone and Telegraph company,
for Hugh minors Jiaye no oiju?i-|ounda
tiori than the dgiy* imagination of the
editor himself. Be it known that 1
hate no connection at. present that
I have never had any connection in
the past: and do not expect to have
any connection in the future, with
the lAmerican Telephone and Tele­
graph company. Nor is there any
other corporation of any description
interested in any way In my candi­
dacy for the presidency of the United
States.
"Second. My position on the ques
tion of conservation was announced
in my letter to the Estabrook League
of Nebraska in December of last year,
on file at the office of the secretary of
state in Lincoln, Nebraska, where I
said: 'I believe in the conservation of
national resources, if by that phrase
is meant—not the absolute withdraw­
al of our natural resources from pres
ent use for the sole benefit of genera­
tions unborn, but their economical
use by those now living, For example,
1 would protect' the lumber interests
by a tariff, provided that a tree is
planted for every tree destroyed. To
withdraw water-power from use or
shackle its use with financial restric­
tions is obyioysly .false economy, for
it cripples the living with no possible
advantage to their posterity. In strict­
est truth it is beyond man's compe­
tency utterly to destroy anything. All
he can do is to change one form of
energy into another, and with the ab
solute need will come his knowledge
of how to change.it back again. I am
of course in favor of whatever restric­
tions may be necessary to insure hon­
esty and fairness in all dealings with
the natural resources of our country.
"When I saw in a Minneapolis pa­
per that a circular letter had been
sent out by the Retail Liquor Dealers'
association asking members of the as­
sociation'to vote against Mr. Cum
mins and. in favor of President Wil­
son and myself, -it was my first inti­
mation that any such action had been
taken or contemplated by that asso­
ciation. Neither I myself nor any one
in my behalf had anything to do with
this action, or inspired it in any way.
And, on the face of it, the letter plain­
ly indicates that the members of that
organization were solicited to vote
against Mr. Cummins not because
they loved Wilson and Estabrook
more, but Cummins less.
The whole mystery that the editor
in question has piled up around me
will vanish, I hope, when I tell you
that I entered the presidential race as
the result of solicitations on the part
of a number of warm personal friends
who, because of their belief in me
and the principles which I had been
advocating for more than thirty years,
said they would stand by me and do
all in their power to help me ,in my
canvass, if I would consent to enter
the race. And I have been doing my
best ever since to prove worthy of
their friendship and their confidence.
Fourth. As for not defining my po­
sition on the question of national pre­
paredness, it is enough to say that I
did that as early as September of
1915 in a speech at Seattle before the
American Bankers' association. It
-was the subject I discussed at James
toHrn in my first speech in North Da

German Army Pauses to Take

Attack.
RUSSIANS-M9VMG SWIFTLY
TOWARD MESOPOTAMIA
Admiral Von Tirpitz Has Retired
From Control of NavaJ
Forces.
'London, March 1?i.—The German
Kronprinz's army apparently has
paused to take breath or bring up re
inforcements for a continuance of the
advance against the Verdun fortress
and its outlying defenses. Meanwhile
the big guns are exchanging shells at
various points along the 'entire line
from Belgium to the Vosges moun­
tains.
Advices from Petrograd describe re
markable work in Perisa of the Rus
sian troops who are moving swiftly
over difficult roads and in the face of
considerable opposition toward the
Mesopotamia frontier, where shortly
they expect to be in touch with the
British forces at Kut-El-Amara and
the relieving column under Generals
Lake and Hylmer.
The Russians are now said to be
within 15 miles of the last difficult
pass, which will place them in the
rear of the Turkish Bagdad army, and
their object is to cut the railway to
the north, thereby preventing the
Turkish army from receiving supplies,
and co-operating with the British
against Bagdad.
Capture Officers.
In their advance against the Turks,
along the Black Sea, a little toward
Trebizond, the Russians have captur
ed additional Turkish officers and
men and two machine guns. A Brit
ish column has attacked an advance
position of the Turks in Mesopotamia,
bayonetted a considerable number of
the Turks and captured others.
The British have captured the port
of Solium in west Egypt from Senussi
tribesmen led by Turkish officers with
only slight resistance.
Afterward they pursued the fleeing
tribesmen and captured officers, men,
and guns.
In east Africa the Boer general,
Smuts, is actively pressing the Ger­
mans, who are reported to be retiring
southward along the Fangi railway.
During the illness of General Gal
lieni, the French minister of war, his
post will be filled by Rear Admiral
Lecase, minister of marine.
Resent Attack.
Considerable resentment was arous­
ed in the house of commons today by
a bitter attack on Premier Asquith by
Sir Arthur Basil Markham, Liberal
member for Nottinghamshire, who as­
serted that Mr. Asquith was a profes­
sional politician. !He quoted Mr. As
quith's remarks that the premier
would stick at nothing to end the war
and added 'the only thing he will
stick to is his salary."
This brought loud cries of disap­
proval from every quarter of the
house, and also demands for the with­
drawal of the accusation.
Walter Hume Long, president' ot
the local government board, declared
that it was unnecessary to defend
Premier Asquith from personal at

Most ^Bitter Fight In Party's
Ranks is Now Raging
Fargo, N. D., March 15.—Democ­
racy's family skeleton is out ol' the
closet, and the key is lost.
All because the executive commit­
tee of the state central committee of
the democratic party in North Dakota
recently issued a statement to the
democratic voters of the state, urg­
ing the election of H. H. Perry as
national committeeman, to succeed
John Bruegger.
It's a case of "look what you went,
and done."
"The E'ulletin," issued today from
the press of a Fargo concern, and
which will be given widespread cir­
culation throughout the state, calls
by name and .number, certain mem­
bers of the executive committee of
the democratic central body, and
says they are liars.
"The Bulletin" doesn't mince
words. It doesn't say, "Mr. Johnson,
I believe you are mistaken!" II says
—in black and white—"i.Mr. Johnson,
you're a liar."
It's a circular headed, "An Appeal
For Fair Play and Harmony in the
Democratic Party," that has brought
forth today's addition to documentary
evidence of democracy's rapidly grow­
ing breach.
"Soreheads" Speak.
The circular was signed by .1. Nel­
son Kelly of Grand Forks, Charles
Simon, F- A. Willson, Jens Pederson,
John Sprat'ka, members of the execu­
tive commit tee, and one sentence in
particular has brought forth tin- Bru­
egger organization's wrath. "Mr.
Rruegger is endeavoring to make it
appear that those* who are opposed
».-ar«T 'Koreheadfi' anrl -'diHitp
poinlod office-seekers.' Thei'e is not
a. single name attached to this let
ler of any man who is keeking or who
has sought, a federal appointment,"
is the sentence in I lie executive com­
mittee's declaration that has brought
the skeleton out.
"•Mr. Charles Simon, stand up!"
commands "The Bulletin. "Did you
not, on Jan. 24, litH, address a let I ot­
to the state chairniart of your party
asking appointment as receiver of the
United Slates land office at Dickin­
son, and requesting the chairman's
influence for an endorsement for your
candidacy? Such a letter is on file
among the records of the chairman,
signed by you," says "The Bulletin."
Of Jens Pederson of Mil nor, the
Bruegger declaration insists that he,
Pederson, attempted to gain the ap­
pointment of an employe in his store
at Milnor as postmaster—and that
the plan failed because of opposition
within the democratic organization
in his home county.
John Sprafka of Minto, another of
the committee members in question,
is cited to the appointment of his
daughter as postmistress at Minto,
gained, Bruegger insists, through his,
Bruegger's endorsement, given at
Sprafka's request.
"J. Nelson Kelly, stand up," com­
mands "The Bulletin" again, to the
superintendent of schools at Grand
Forks. "Is it not true that you de­
manded the appointment of a Mr.

Foot Draft Vessels May Pass
Through.
Washington, March 15.—An official
prediction that the Panama canal will
be opened by April 15 for the passage
of deep draught vessels was announc­
ed tonight by the war department.
Col. Harding, acting governor of
the Canal zone, telegraphed the war
department today as follows:
"Conditions in Gaillard cut justify
predictions that the canal will be
available for ships of 30-foot draught
on April 15, subject to probable tem­
porary delays thereafter to meet ex­
igencies of the dredging fleet in com­
pleting the canal td its full width
arid depth, and in removing shoals
that may possibly develop."'
Official* Had Been Reticent
Until this report came, canal offi­
cials had refused since the closure to
make any estimate of the probable
dote of reopening. Col. Harding's
telegram is taken to mean that short
of another great movement of earth,
the canal will be practically in full
operation again after April 15.

General Funston to Send Informa­
tion Only When Events Are
Transpiring.
Washington, March 15.—With Am­
erican troops across the Mexican bor­
der tonight, seeking Villa and his
bandits, President Wilson and offi­
cials of the war department resigned
themselves to a wait possibly many
days for news of developments in
the case. Information that forces of
the de facto government were co­
operating with the expedition from
the United States served to relieve
the tense anxiety that had been ap­
parent on all sides ovpr the possibil­
ity of Carranza troops revolting
against, their commanders and at­
tempting to oppose
the
entry of the
Americans.

(Although Brigadier Oneral Persh­
ing and Col. Dodd marched into Mex­
ico with some 5,000 men, about noon
today, it was not until more than six
hours afterwards thai the official an­
nouncement came to Washington. It
was received this evening and Secre­
tary Baker at once hurried to the
White House for a conference with
the president.
Officers of the general staff were

ed, no additional information of im­
portance bad been received. General

Silence At War- Department.
Throughout the day the war depart­
ment maintained rigid silence as lo
the situation on the border. General
Funston was moving his pieces in the
grim game with Villa behind a. cur
lain of complete secrecy. II probably
was the most complete censorship the
country has ever known. The screen
was drawn so close that the depart­
ment itself was no!, advised of the
crossing until hours after the troops
were on the march.
Bulletins Contain Little News.
Only meagre news bulletins from
the troops in Mexico are expected.
While four correspondents of press
associations have been credent ialed
to accompany General Pershing's
command, they will be under strict
censorship.
Congress completed the work begun
yesterday, the senate concurring in
the house resolution, providing for an
increase in the regular army to ap­
proximately 120.000 fighting troops.
There was little debate and the fi9
senators in the chamber voted unani­
mously for the resolution.
What To Do With Villa.
While apparently there has been no
formal discussion of what shell be
done with Villa if he is captured, it is
regarded as probable mat if taken
alive, the bandit leader will be turned
over to the de facto government for
prompt execution.
Hold All Arms Shipmnts.
Washington, March 15.—On request
of the .state department, orders have
been sent to collectors of customs at
seaports of the I'nited States and
along the 'Mexican border to hold up
all shipments of arms, ammunition,
or explosives consigned to Mexico,
except such as it is clearly estab­
lished are designed for the de facto
government. The order was said to
be the outcome of information reach­
ing the department that a large con­
signment of explosives intended for
the Villa forces was about to be sent
south. The instructions are sweeping
in character and forbid shipments
into Mexico along the northern bor­
der or any seaport. Tiiey win shut

senting the Carranza government.

Wipe Villa 'From Earth.
General Pershing has gone into

General Funston Optimistic.
General Funston regarded the situ­
ation optimistically. He appeared to
have no doubt that the men in the
field Would render a good account of
themselves in the work undertaken
and he was hopeful that Villa would
be forced into a corner at an early
date.
No iNews.
If the exact whereabouts of Villa
are known at army headquarters, the
fast has not been disclosed. Gener­
ally, it is believed that he has moved
southward, toward the Guerrero dis­
trict in the foothills of the Sierra

sources indicate that the de fadto

to turn him northward toward the ad­
