JUST WANTED TO THAW OUT
Captain of American Vessel Acted as
Host to Half Dozen Undersea
Germans in Distress.
So cold did the crew of a German
submarine become while sailing be
neath Ice floes in tho Baltic sea that
they rose to the surface, halted tho
American steamer Moroni, bound from
Copenhagen to Philadelphia, and asked
permission to spend the afternoon
aboard in order lo thaw out. Captain
Wheeler, master of the Morenl, told
of the incident just before his vessel
left Philadelphia.
About the middle of December,
when the steamer was battling against
furious gales in the Baltic, the chief
ofiicer noticed that they were being
signaled by a submarine. The U-boat
came alongside and eight men came
aboard the Morenl. Captain Wheeler
supposed they wanted to examine the
ship’s papers, but they told him all <
they desired was a few hours' release
from their frigid quarters on the un
dersea vessel.
Although heavily clad in fur gar
ments, the Germans were blue from
Hie cold. They said their craft had
boon unTler tho ice nearly two days,
unable to rise because of the drifting
(iocs, and that it had become almost
impossible to live in the submarine.
The plates that formed the sides of
the boat, they said, were only half an
inch thick and the heating apparatus
was inadequate.
The steward of the Morenl glad
dened tho visitors with coffee and oili
er hot drinks. They remained aboard
until nearly dark. Then, after being
assured by Captain Wbeeler that none
but Americans were on the Morenl,
they went back into the submarine
and soon disappeared under Hie ice.
Scottish Ghost Story.
Tho young Grenadier guardsman,
Sir George Houstoun-Boswail, who is
reported "missing, believed killed,” is
a wealthy Berwickshire landowner
and a scion of an ancient Scottish
family. A weird ghost story is asso
ciated with Allanbank, tho residence
Inherited by him from Ills ancestors,
the extinct Stuart baronets. Allun
bank remained empty for a number
of years because it was haunted by
an apparition known as "Pearlin
Jean," so called because she was a
novice in a continental convent when
the first baronet. Sir Robert Stuart,
fell in love with her. Sir Robert de
serted her, and tho girl flung herself
under the wheels of his carriage, and
was killed. When tho faithless lover
returned to Allanbank he was hor
rified by visions of the girl. Seven
ministers were called in to lay
"Pearlin Jean,” but her spirit would
not rest.
Teaching Cops Politeness.
Commissioner Wood lias a plan to
remove the sulphur from the atmos
phere, says Hie New York Times. He
has Just organized a squad of uni
formed professors of ethical culture,
with trallic policemen. The commis
sioner has discovered that the cops in
their controversies with chauffeurs of
ten go a bit beyond the bounds of par
lor conversation. Instead of the po- \
liceman saying “ "to the chauf- j
four, and tho chauffeur replying in
like manner, it is planned to have the
policemen say softly: "Pardon me, if
you will please turn that automobile
of yours around and go west through
that other street, it will relieve me
of considerable worry.” And tho
chauffeur is expected to reply: "All
right, dear sir. You are absolutely
correct. I shall do as you suggest.”
To make it easier for them, the pro
fessors are conducting some of their
classes in garages and stables.
Geese Could Not Skate.
A flock of more than fifty wild geese
mistook glare ice in Kabckona bay,
Leech Lake, Minn., for placid water,
and after alighting on the smooth
surface were unable to take flight and
wore held prisoners. Tho ice was so
slippery it prevented Hie geese from
“taking a running start" In order to
fly.
The geese, falling about on Hu If
backs, attracted four hunters, who
were unable to reach the geese on ac
count of the dangerous thinness of
Hie ice. Finally a wooden platform
was built and pushed over the ice
into the flock. The birds then flopped
aboard the platform, made a run of It
and soon were flying away.
Cold-Blooded Criticism.
“It's impossible to tell the truth
all the time.”
"So it seems. What prompted that
remark?”
“I’ve just been listening to a man
discusAng the merits of his new mo
torcar. The gloss of the tonneau, tho
luxurious upholstery, the dazzling re
flection from the brass and nickel
parts and the swiftly spinning wheels
of a new car never fail to bewitch the
senses of its owner and warp his
judgment of a machine that is at best
but a striking example of man's in
ability to make anything that is per
fect.”
Such Insolence!
“Let me pay the fare, dear,” said
the woman in blue.
"No, no, dear. I’ll pay It, ’ said tho
woman in black.
"But, I insist.”
"Oh, no. I have a dime somewhere
In ray purse if I can only find it.”
1 “So have I. Wait a moment while I
I took.'
"Ladles,” said a large, gruff man.
j 'l'll pay your carfare. The argu
ment is getting on ray nerves.”
I And they both glared at the brute
In unspeakable amazement
A Family Nswspaper—lndependent In Politics —Devoted to literature, Local and Genital News.
THURMONT, FREDERICK COUNTY, MD., THURSDAY, MARCH 16, 1916.
IN PRIMITIVE RUSSIA
REGION WHICH CIVILIZATION HAS
NOT REACHED.
Inhabited by Nomadic Race, Who Live
as Their Forefathers Lived Through
out the Centuries —Have
Many Peculiar Customs.
Interest is still kept up In Groat
tlritaiu in other things besides • the
war. The other day, tor instance, a
Mr. F. A. Holiday, a traveler, gave
an address before the Society of Arts
in London on the Uralak, a province
in Asian mid-Russia, northeast of the
Caspian sea.
Valuable oil Helds exist hero, and
also deposits of sulphur and other
minerals useful in peace and war.
Mr. Holiday said that the land was
very Hat, and thero was almost an
absence of trees, which caused ttie
fuel problem to be somewhat acute.
The advent of western civilisation fur
nished the inhabitants with a certain
amount of firewood in the shape ol tel
egraph poles and slakes Used to mark
out claims.
The Cossacks, had, however, taught
them to respect the former, though
not in some cases the latter. The
original inhabitants were the Kirghiz,
an essentially nomadic race, who
lived in dome-shaped tents made of a
light wooden frame covered with
camel skins.
Iho tents had no furniture, but
sometimes beautiful oriental rugs or
carpets were placed on the Hour, a
space being left on which a Are was
made.
When the Kirghiz used the tele
graph poles as firewood, they did not
lake the whole polo away, but each
man chipped off a piece until at last
the whole pole gave way.
A prince was a man with 100 or
200 sheep, and a prince in winter
generally lived in a house built of
bricks made out of the saud and
baked in the sun.
The houses were sunk in the
ground for warmth in the winter.
They had window frames and doors,
hut the firewood question was so acute
that when the people went on trek
in the summer they look lire window
frames and doors out and packed them
on tiro backs of camels for fear the
people who did not trek would steal
them.
The L'ral river was a great source
of wealth to tho Cossacks, for it was
well stocked with Hsh. At one time
a barge crossed tho river, but the
Cossacks would not allow it to cross
after dark, us they said that the fish
wanted to sleep as well us anybody
else.
The outbreak of war put a great
ciieck on the developments of tho
L'raisk and of oilier oil fields. A
great deal of prospecting and pre
liminary work was necessarily stopped,
and companies which were already
well established met with fresh diffi
culties.
In some places ‘ gas holes." around
which there was often a deposit of
sulphur, were met with. Some of
these spots were venerated by the
Kirghiz, who prayed round them ami
then erected little sticks, to which
they tied little pieces of cloth, as was
the manner of simple peoples.
On one occasion his driver stopped
and prayed by one of these "gas
holes,'' and threw a few kopeks on
the ground, which, he said, were for
the religious authorities when they
came along. Asked if there was not
danger of someone stealing them, tiro
driver replied that if he prayed for
relief from sickness and trouble, and
then someone stole the money, the
thief would get tho trouble and sick
ness, so there was no danger.
To Improve Cattle In Bengal.
The decadence of cattle In the prov
ince of Bengal forms the subject of
an Interesting monograph recently
published by the director of agricul
ture for the province. The cause of
their decadence he attributes partly
to climatic conditions, partly to tha
lack of grazing grounds, and largely
to the headless breeding policy of tho
Bengal cattle owner. His chief rec
ommendations are the provision of
good bulls and the establishment of
superior milk-yielding cows, draft
bullocks and bulls. The report la il
lustrated by a most interesting collec
tion of photographs descriptive of the
various species of cattle ranging from
the Himalayas to the Bay of Bengal—
from the record bull bison, measuring
18 hands 2M> inches at the shoulder
and Ik hands 3 inches at the hump,
down to the humble lineaments of the
Malda calf which at sixteen months
measured only 36 inches in height be
hind the hump.
Increased Use of Quinine.
That the use of quinine is rising In
popularity is amply borne out in a
statement laid before the legislative
council of India, recently. This state
ment shows that in 1913 the sales of
this medicine were just over forty-five
and a quarter million grains, whereas
in 1914 the sales had increased to close
on seventy-two and a half million
grains and for the first eleven mouths
of last year the sales exceed seventy
three and three-quarter million grains.
Oregon Coal Mining.
About sixty years ago coal was first
mined in the Coos bay region of Ore
gon. The first cargo was shipped from
the Empire basin, but the discovery
of coal near the head of Coos bay soon
transferred the point of production to
Newport, which remained the princi
pal mine until within tha last decade.

(Copyright. 1916. by W. Q. Chapman.)
"My daughter shall never marry out
of her class!” vociferated self-opinion
ated old Joel Clarke.
“Well, I’m not In her class, I’ll ad
mit,” spoke I crcy Lane, lugubriously.
“She’s a princess, a queen, 1 know
that.”
“You mistake my meaning.” retort
ed Clarke, Incisively. "Biuche is a
poor man's daughter. You have be
come a scion of wr>*'th. You'll never
havo an opportun.iy to throw your
wealth in her face.”
“Oh!" drawled out honest, well
meaning and madly-ln-love Percy, “it’s
the money? Why, first thing I got it.
and ail so unexpe , .;diy, ray thought
was of Blanche, dear girl! and how
delighted I’d be to be able to give her
ad Hie luxuries slio doseives.”
“Wrong pew!” observed Clarke, sen
tentiously “You’ve got my ultimatum.
Go away.”
“All right, sir.”
“And stay away.”
“Very Well."
“And don’t ever come back again,
for It will be no use.”
“I won’t, until I’m poor as a church
mouse.”
“You can t be that, with a big busi
ness block all your own, and all kinds
of stocks and bonds and bank ac
counts, they 101 l me. No, go and mar
ry a millionaire's daughter. She’s the
sort for you. You shan't, Blanche.
I'm a consistent man. Go away!” this
time thundered the old man.
Percy Lane departed dolorously. It
was "hard luck!" He had always
loved Blanche and she loved him in
return. Ho was sure of that.
So sure, he ruminated ns he took
tho train back for his homo town,
"that I’ll write her ray sentiments."
Ills “sentiments” were forthwith
enunciated in a brief i..te, which be
“|’|| Trade It Off for a Horse With a
Spavin.”
Indited on the train and mailed that
very evening. It ran:
“Dear Blanche: Your father objects
to a rich son-in-law. Watch me make
ducks and drakes of the fortune Uncle
Allen so kindly left me!”
Poor, worrying Blanche received
the note and proceeded to expect some
terrible news from down Rushville
way. She knew that it would be use
less to appeal to or remonstrate with
her resolute father. She forthwith
wrote to a cousin in Rushville, asking
her to keep her fully posted as to
everything going on in general and
about tho man she loved In particu
lar.
Percy Lane started out to cut a wide
swath. First and foremost, he sent
for all the poor relatives that Uncle
Allen had forgotten in his will. He
distributed the year’s Income from the
big business block among them. Then
he went the rounds of the churches
and local charity societies. His dona
tions were princely. By this time his
actual cash holdings had got pretty
low'.
“I’ll make a thorough job of it,” de
cided Percy grimly, and the august
conservative president of the local
bank looked positively aghast one
morning when Percy entered the In
stitution with the announcement:
“There’s some stocks and bonds of
mine here. I want them.”
“My dear sir,” expostulated the old
banker, “1 hope you are not going to
change the form of security. Those
you now have are seasoned guaran
teed Investments.”
"I know, I know,” responded Percy,
lightly. Well, I’m going to the city
to try a scurry on the market.”
“You’ll regret it, sir, let me assure
you,” prophesied the banker. “If.
however, you are bent on your own
way—”
“I am,” asserted Percy stubbornly.
‘Any advice I can give you—’’
“Thanks, no,” dissented Percy. “I
want experience and I’m willing to pay
for it.” tt
Percy Lane got the “experience
right enough. That he paid for It, and
dearly, too, was known all over th
town when he returned. It looked as
though he had employed some secret
press agent to spread the details of
his "flurry on the market.”
“Wildcat stocks.” Percy was
charged with having remarked—
"they’re Just what I want. The name
suggests fighting, and that will give
some vim to the occasion.
“And the gold mine in Alaska,
Percy?" a friend insinuated.
“Oh, the first funds helped the pro
moters along. They sloped, leaving
the Investors to hold the bag; but
that’s one of the risks of the game,
ee?”
Very soon the town "saw” that
Percy bad got rid of about all he had.
Blanche heard of it and really sor
rowed, for money was money. SHU,
she fathomed the reckless procedure
of her lover as the only means of
finally winning her.
Percy met Blanche’s father on a
country road one day. Percy assumed
the reckless air of a man of the world
arrived at the end of his rope.
“Oh, you ain’t so poor!” remarked
Mr. Clarke. “There's that big busi
ness block left yet.”
"I’ll trade it off for a horse with a
spavin, or a second-hand Un-Lizzie,
but I’ll get rid of it,’’ vaunted Percy.
And then, one morning, as he start
ed downtown, a neighbor made a
somewhat startling announcement.
"I suppose you know about it," were
his words, “but your business block
burned to the ground lust night."
“That so?” observed Percy. “Any
body hurt?”
“Not a soul.”
“Then —hurrah!"
Percy Lane packed up his belong
ings. He was at the home town of his
fiancee by noon; he was In consulta
tion with her father an hour later.
"I’ve made it!” he announced jubi
lantly to the old man.
“Made what?” questioned Mr. Clarke
auspiciously.
"Poverty—humble life ahead—one
of your class. Liquid assets all specu
lated away. Last remnant of former
prosperity, the business block, went
up in smoke last night."
“Surely poor, are you?" queried
Clarke.
"I surely am!” asserted Percy,
proudly.
“Then what are you going to get
married on?" demanded the practical
old man.
“Oho! shifting winds when the situ
ation changes?" railed Percy. "Well,
I have made arrangements for a living
position down at tho telegraph office.”
Percy Insisted upon an immediate
marriage. Ho was through with wealth
and was ready to settle down to a
humble, honest career. His sacrifice
and pertinacity staggered the old man,
Blanche seconded Hie proposition, it
was an economical wedding. The
honeymoon meant a gay day of stnll
ing in the woods amid tho beauties of
nature. Then Percy went to work
Then Blanche settled down to happy,
contented housekeeping in two rooms.
"This is real life!” exulted Percy
"Oh, what bliss after the cankering
cares of wealth!”
Throe days later old Clarke burst in
upon the loving pair. His face showed
Intense excitement, his manner was
wroth.
“Baffled! derided! tricked!" he
spluttered, and glared at the astound
ed Percy.
"What now, father?” intimated the
latter, softly.
“Bah! traitor! avaunt! base deceiv
er!”
"Bah and avaunt?” repented Percy,
reflectively. “What's the answer?”
"This is the answer!” shouted
Blanche's father, and he ripped open
a newspaper In his hand:
"We are advised that Mr. Percy
I>ane, our young esteemed townsman
will receive sixty thousand dollars in
surance on the hotel block recently de
stroyed by lire,” read the old man.
“Aha!” cried Percy. "I novel
thought of that.”
"Oh, Percy!” prattled Blanche, de
llghtedly. “Now we can buy that new
parlor set —’’
“Rich!” howled old Clarke. “A
Croesus!”
"Father,” said Percy, soothingly
“can I help It? I thought 1 was poor
you accepted me as poor. Money
shan’t take me from honest work and
honest love, so be sensible and join
us in sunning ourselves under this un
expected shower of gold!"
Polite Literature.
When "A History of New York,” by
Washington Irving, appeared in the
Christmas season of 1809, it made a
tremendous sensation, according to
Hamilton Wright Mabie. It was greet
ed with a chorus of laughter or with
shouts of denunciation.
To satirize the Dutch families ol
that time was to lay an irreverent
hand on the social ark; and a decade
later a distinguished citizen of Dutch
descent described it as a "gross car
icature,” while Scott wrote to Henry
Brevoort that he had been reading it
aloud to Mrs. Scott and two ladies
who were guests, and “our sides have
been absolutely sore with laughter.”
It was not a great work, but it was
the beginning of what used to be
called "pplße literature” In this coun
try.
From the hour of Us publication
American books began to be read
abroad, and the literary idea and at
mosphere found a home in the new
world.
To the Finish.
“Going to the meeting of the Peace
society tonight?”
"I don’t know. Anything particular
doing?”
“I should say so. Annual election of
officers. They say there’ll be a hot
fight on.”

LITTLE BUT A MORY
FAMOUS BATTLESHIP OREGON
HAS HAD ITS DAY.
Seventeen Years Ago She Was Prob
ably the Most famous Vessel
Afloat—Now Is Relegated to
a Minor Position.
Seventeen years ago the name of
the Oregon was on the lips of every
American. It had rounded the Horn
on a record-breaking voyage of 18,000
miles and then won additional renown
in the battle of Santiago bay. The
Oregon was the pride of Uncle Sara
the queen of the seas. For years, how
ever, it has been out of date. Officially
it has been rated as a second-class ves
sel; by the more flippant as Junk.
Now tho navy department lias got rid
of it by presenting it to Hie state of
California for use by its naval militia.
So runs the world away -for battle
ships as well as lor men. observes the
Sioux City Journal.
Who that recalls the war with Spain
will ever forget the Oregon? Foresee
ing a break with Spain, Washington
ordered it to sail from Mare island
navy yard at San Francisco to Key
West. The long distance run proved
to bo a most spectacular undertaking.
War was declared while the Oregon
was on its way, and tears for its safe
ty were entertained until it hove in
sight, reports having been set afloat
that Spain had sent out a fleet to in
tereept it. 'Hie long trip was remark
able for the fact that tho battleship
stopped nowhere except for coal and
was not delayed an hour by any break
down in its machinery. Capt. Charles
Edgar Clark was in command, and hia
name became almost as famous as
that of the Oregon. He is one of Hie
few of those who took leading roles
in the Spanish-Americau war who arc
still alive.
Nor did tho Oregon rest on ila
laurels after it had steamed into Key
West late in May, 1898. It bad been
brought from the Pacific to the Atlan
tic for business, and that business was
to fight. It proceeded at once to San
tiago and in tho battle of July 3 with
Admiral Cervera’n fleet was in the
thick of Hie trouble from the first lo
last. To Hie Oregon belongs credit
for forcing Hie surrender of tho Viz
cava and tho Christobal Colon and
possibly for saving Hie Brooklyn, the
flagship of Commodore Schley.
Yet today this one time bulldog ol
the navy is not considered of enough
account in the national armament lu
be kept in the service! So many
changes have come about in the mak
ing of battleships 1 lie once wonderful
Oregon is now a fit subject for the
scrap heap. It was a great vessel in
its day, and around it cluster hal
lowed memories, but more than that
cannot be said for it.
Let anyone who has a notion that
the United States navy has not been
growing in the last twenty years com
pare a list of the vessels which then
made up our defense at sea with a list
of the vessels of 1915. Where then
the lowa, the Indiana and others stood
proudly at the head of the procession
now they humbly fall in far behind the
Arizona, tho Pennsylvania and others
of later make and more generous pro
portions. Yet the Arizona's day and
the Pennsylvania's day also will come
as has come that of the Oregon, and
as came that of the Monitor and that
of Old Ironsides.
Business Man.
Harry Pollok, manager of Freddy
Welsh, lightweight champion of the
world, once took a fighter to Atlanta
and in the second round his man
quit cold, fallfng to the canvas at a
very light punch, and remaining there
until he was counted out.
Harry dragged tho limp form back
to the corner and went through the
motions of reviving Hie "flopper.” Fin
ally the fellow opened his eyes, fak
ing slowly returning consciousness
fairly well, and as Harry was about
to cut loose the vials of wrathful dis
gust, the boxer reached for hia bath
robe and said nonchalantly:
"Well, manager, where do I fight
next?”
Measles Yield to Serum.
An entirely new treatment of mea
sles is reported by Dr. Umberto Ma-
Joli In II Policlinico. It consists in
the removal of blood serum from con
valescents and injecting it into pa
tients in the acute stage of the dis
ease. Doctor Majoli tried it during
an epidemic of measles at Ancona,
and with great success. He gave in
jections from 5 to 20 cubic centime
ters of a mixed serum obtained from
several convalescents. Tho effect was
to lower the disease and prevent com
plications. The Medical Record notes
that a similar treatment has been used
in scarlet fever since 1896.
She Drank, Smoked, Shaved.
That a woman had masqueraded for
four years as a man was not known

FRIENDSHIP THAT RINGS TRUE
Always a Condition That Requires
Thorough Understanding and
Complete Sympathy.
Somo acquaintances will never ripen
into true friendship because the com
mon bond of union, the thorough un
derstanding and the complete sym
pathy arc lacking.
An acquaintance begun in child
hood will ripen into friendship if the
children develop mutual interest in a
common cause of study or pleasure, if
dissimilar tastes and unlike impulses
develop the children will grow apart,
since each of us tends toward certain
centers of association.
Money cannot Luy us friends. It
often purchases apparent friendship,
but when the wealth goes that which
posed as friendship vanishes also.
Friendship must he distinguished
from that sentimental feeling which is
so common among young girls. This
ridiculous fascination, which ex
presses itself in extravagant terms of
endearment, is very fickle.
As soon as it tinds faults in one idol
It transfers its affection to another.
Youth has yet to learn that perfection
In human nature does not exist. The
sensible man or woman does not set
up un ideal of friendship so high that
it must bo shattered.
Friends influence us for good or
evil, Unfortunately we can guide the
formation of our friendships only to a
very limited extent, either for our
selves or for our children.
Friendship springs up and grows
naturally; It cannot be planted at will.
Foolish friendships are often formed
in youth. It is useless to talk against
them, since young people always re
sent criticism of their friends. We
must simply tolerate them and trust
to the awakening of common sense to
prove all frivolous friendships false
and unworthy.—Philadelphia Inqufrcr.
Odd Mail Service.
A novel mail service is to be put in
to operation on the Magdalena river,
in the Republic of Colombia, seasleda
having bet'ii planned to ply between
Bogota and the coast. By the water
route the distance between the two
points is more than 800 miles. It Is
expected that it will be covered at an
average speed of nearly forty miles
an hour. Tests were recently made
on the Hudson river, near Now York,
with an oddly designed craft which
lias been built especially for this serv
ice. It is a broad-beamed glider,
equipped with a high-power motor, and
driven by two aerial propellers mount
ed at the stern. It Is capable of carry
ing a number of passengers, and when
loaded draws only five inches of wa
ter. While traveling at its maximum
Speed, however, the sled requires only
one inch of water, for it skims along
barely cutting the surface. Its slight
draft is made necessary by the shal
lowness of the river on which It Is tc
operate.
Wire in Great Demand.
Particularly for the transmission of
high potential currents the steel
aluminum wire has been found most
desirable often ten years’ experience,
during which time, it Is stated, two
companies alone are making use of
7U,000,000 pounds of conductor of this
character. The aluminum has great
efficiency, together with lightness,
while the steel imparts strength, so
that it is possible to maintain reason
ably long spans, which is not so with
the conductor made alone of alumi
num. The simplest form of the steel
aluminum cable is that to which six
aluminum strands are laid around a
central si eel wire, all of the seven
strands b< ing of the same size. Larger
ureas usually have the single steel
wire repla ed by a seven-wire steel ca
ble of the aamu area, the ratio of steel
to aluminum being the same In both
cases.
“City Healthier Than Farm."
“TUo sanitary conditions In the
farmers’ h aies of Massachusetts and
New York state are not what they
should be," Dr. Harvey W. Wiley de
clared in an address before several
hundred farmers from all over the
state in Horticultural hall, assembled
for the Massachusetts state board of
agricultural s annual meeting.
“in New Y’ork and Massachusetts
particularly, the city is a healthier
place to live than the country,” Doctor
Wiley said. "The cities of New York:
and Massachusetts are taking better
care of their citizens than the coun
try is, and I am inclined to believe
that the unfavorable situation in the
rural sections is due more to lack of
sanitary conveniences and appliances
than it Is to the effect of the climate
or of a deficient diet.”
Thieves Leave Sacred Records.
All but three of the 75 talking-ma
chine records of the Blrdsboro High
school were stolon by a thief, who
forced an entrance into the building,
turned on a light and tried out all the
records, it is believed. Thumb marks
on the three left behind showed they
were tested too.
The selections rejected were “Lead
Kindly Light,” “Jesus, Lover of My
Soul” and “Nearer, My God to Thee.*
Most of the records stolen were rag
tine and marches. —Reading Dls
