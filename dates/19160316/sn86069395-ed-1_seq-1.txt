HOPKINSVILLE
EDITORIAL COMMENT.

.
There arc 56 entries for the Ken
tucky Derby May 13.
Now that the Legislature has quit,
r Hit wimcr uo iikuwisu
With two murder cases on the
docket, the grand jury has just added
five more, all but one being negroes.
Carranza claims to have 15,000 Wen
after Villa and hopes to catch him
before Gen. Pershing gets to pushing.
Judge Bill Reed made a big hit as
special judge at Owcnsboro. He has
a way of doing that wherever he
serves.
If everything is now good and
ready, suppose, we send brass bands
ahead in every direction to announce
to Villa that wc are about to start a
hunt for him.
. There are 129, 000 state troops avail
able, if needed in Mexico. Kentucky
has 168 officers and'2,329 men, more
than any Southern state except Geor
gia and Virginia.
A balky horse decided to balk on a
railroad crossing at West Gorlin, N.
J., in front of an approaching train,
and caused two women and a man in
Ihe carriage to be killed.
A Mexican paper at Durango pub
lished the startling information that
Villa had captured Texas and New
Mexico and that President Wilson
and his family were fleeing to Canada
jr safety.
There ought not to be any trial in
the case of Villa, other than by mar
tial law. His capture should be fol
lowed by summary execution, a job
that Carranza would probably like to
have a hand in. ,
.Tns. McManus. Jr.. a song writer
at Los Angeles, proposed to Mrs.
Gamett Buckner Martin, a Kentucky
grass-widow, who sang one of his
songs to suit him at a public function.
The widow accepted.
American refugees arriving at
Douglas, Ariz., report that Carranza
soldiers are as bitter towards Ameri
cans as Villa's followers. They re
port that the Mexicans generally
sympathize with Villa.
Former Secretary Bryan approves
the invasion of Mexico, saying:
"While the outrage is a distressing
one and deserves the severest pun
ishment, lam glad the president has
not permitted himself to be forced in
to invasion by those who have been
trying for two years to get this coun
try into war with Mexico. This is the
first time we have had sufficient cause
to cross the border."
Gov. Stanley came to Hopkinsville
to get one of the two Republican
members on tho Board of Control
and the coveted honor falls to Hon.
Robt. A. Cook, Christian county's
representative in tho House. This is
good news to Bob's friends, who are
not confined to his own party by any
means. He is a native of this county,
workqd his way to the front by teach
ing, Later was elected countyassessor,
got into politics and spent four years
at Frankfort under the Willson admin
istration and has since been an attor
ney at law. He was turned down by
his party when ho sought the position
of minority leader of the House, but
jfiow drops into one of tho nicest jobs
AALthe disposal of the Democratic Gov
, cA'br. Now that ho Is on a non-partisan
board, we shall expect him to be
more or less neutral in politics if
possible.

NEARING TIME TO
VOTE BOND ISSUE
Indications Now Point to the
Success of the Proposition
With Votes to Spare.
RUNNING DOWN CAMPAIGN REPORTS
Grand Jury to Investigate and
ueport on charges ot bx-
travagance and Graft.
The close of the campaign for good
roads finds the situation much more
encouraging than it was a month ago.
Opposition to the proposed bond issue
has steadily grown less and it is now
believed to be practically assured that
the proposition will have a safe ma
jority. The supporters of the proposition
are redoubling their efforts to en
courage sentiment for the bond issue
inthis last week. Speakers arc be
ing sent to every neighborhood in the
county, open air meetings are being
held here in town each town. There
will be a big final rally at the Taber
nicle Fridav nirrht and the ainers are
being kept full of matter. On the 1
l t 1! ff
otner nana, n ciose organization oi j
tho county has been perfected and
there will be workers at each of the
thirty-two precincts all day Saturday
who will put in the last licks possible
in behalf of the proposition.
From present indications it is be
lieved the bond issue will carry by a
safe majority. The determined op
position;which for a time threatened
the project seriously has disappeared
to a very large extent under the en
thusiastic campaign which has been
waged. Democrats and republicans
have jointly endorsed the proposition
and everything has been worked on
a bi-partisan basis. A commission of
eight men, four republicans and four
democrats, and all of them residents
of the county, has already been ap
pointed to have charge of the road
funds if the proposition carries.
The negro voters have rallied to
the proposition very largely since
they have been convinced that con
vict labor is not to be employed on
the roads if they are built. As long
as the negroes thought convicts would
do the work and they would get noth
ing out of it, they opposed Jt. But
now that the fiscal, court, the eight
commissioners and the supporters
generally of the proposition have de
clared they would not favor the em
ployment of convicts, the negroes
have changed their attitude.
There are at present 216 miles of
pike in the county and it is estimated
it will take about $1,000 per mile to
reconstruct this. If this proves truo
it will leave about 200,000 for build
ing new pikes 'which, it is estimated,
should miild about forty to fifty miles.
All of the work will be done under
state aid.
County Attorney Ira D. Smith has
ordered a full investigation by the
grand jury, now in session, of re
ports spread broadcast through tho
county that past road funds had been
wasted and even grafted. Mr. Smith
instructed the grand jury to summon
the officials and those who had been
spreading the reports and sift tho
matter thoroughly, mako a report of
their findings and indict parties
should testimony indicate any were
guilty. Tuesday tho county officials
turned over to tho grand jury tho
books of the county, together with
warrants for monoy paid out on road
improvements. The officials and
members of tho fiscal court say
the charges are untrue and malicious,
and they do not propose to sit quiet
ly and let them go unchallenged.
WINTER STILL LINGERS.
Although tho vernal equinox is only
a week off, winter still lingers in tho
lap of spring. Tuesday was a cold,
rainy day, tho rain turning into hail
and snow at night and making a very
disagreeable spell of weather. There
was two inches of snow on tho
ground yesterday morning with
stormy conditions all day.

JIM CROW LAW
VOTED DOWN
House Kills Measure in Last
Day's Session of legis
lature. THE PIKE COUNTY SCANDAL
Rumors of Use of Monty On
Division Measure Are Dis
credited. Frankfort, Ky., MHrch 15. The
most turbulent session of the legisla
ture in Kentucky's history came to an
end at midnight when hands on the
clocks in both chambers were turned
back to give the legislature a few
hours more time in which to clean up
urgent business.
Two things stood out in legislative
proceedings the defeat of the Jim
Crow law in the house providing for
separate street car compartments for
blacks and whites, and a-report to the
senate discrediting rumors and charges
of money being corruptly spent by
persons interested in the division of
Pike county. Tho Jim Crow law had
passed the senate. The proposed act
to divide Pike county was defeated.
Ignoring a petition signed by fifty
two representatives, the house rules
committee again refused to bring out
the Taylor anti-shipment bill, which
fixes a limit on the amount of whisky
and beer which can be sent into "dry"
territory.
The "drys" made an effort yester
day to bring up the measure over the
heads of the committee, but was frus
trated by the ''two-thirds rule."
The bill for the regulation of trad
ing stamp concerns, supported by the
business men of Louisville, was lost
in the senate after a prolonged debate
when a motion to suspend the rules
and bring the measure up for consid
eration was,defeated.
MR. WYATT
HAS RESIGNED
His Connection With Chambers
& Co., and Will Move to
Toledo, 0.
Mr. T. E. Wyatt, who has for the
last four years been -connected with
the wholesale grocery house of W. A.
Chambers & Co., has resigned and
will leave Saturday for Toledo, O.,
to make his home.
1
MR. T. E. WVATT. .
He will become state agent for the
States Motor Car Co., of Kalamazoo,
Mich., for the States Car.
Mr. Wyatt, who came here, from
Elkton, at once became one of Hop
kinsville's most popular and progres
sive citizens and his departure will
occasion much regret, not only in
business circles but in social circles
as well. Mrs. Wyatt is a lady of
many accomplishments and has a
wide circlo of friends. Their leaving
is a distinct loss to tho city in many
ways.

Mass Attacks Northwest of
Verdun Gain But Little
Progress.
FRENCH SHELL ARCONNE FOREST
Italians Continue Big Infantry
Offensive on Isonzo
Front.
Extremely heavy infantry fighting:
has taken place northwest of Verdun,
and on the outskirts of the Bois des
Buttes, to the north of the Aisne, with
the Germans in both regions the ag
gressors. Elsewhere along the line,,
artillery duels of creat proportions
' arc under way.
1 In the sector between Bethincourt
'and Cumicres, northwest of Verdun,
the intense artillery bombardment of
the Germans was followed by an in
fantry attack, but over the entire
( front of three miles it was repulsed bjr
the French with serious los8, ex-
cept between Bethincourt and Lc
Mort Homme, where the Germans
J gained a footing at two points in the
French trenches.
The Germans three times to the
north of the Aisne threw their troops
against the French positions north
west of Bois des Buttes, but none of
the attacks proved successful.
In the forest of Argonne the French
guns effectively shelled German posi
tions. North and east of Vordun tho
artillery duels continue. To the
north of St. Mihiel, in Lorraine, and
in the Vosges mountains, the guns of
both sides have been active. A large
number of fights in the air have tak
en place around Verdun. In these,
four German aircraft have been
brought down. French aviators have
again bombarded the station of Bri
eullcs, behind the German lines north
of Verdun.
The British evidently are breaking
up the opposition of the Senussi
tribesmen, led by Turkish officers, in
western Egypt. An official report re
ceived from Maj.-Gen. Peyton, com
mander of the British forces, says the
occupation of Solium, on the Egyptian-Tripoli
frontier, is imminent; that
the sheik harun has surrendered and
is in the headmen of Aulaid Ali tribe
are asking for pardons.
The Russians are still harassing
the Turks on the Caucasus front and
have made further progress against
the Teutons in east'Galicia. They
entered German trenches in the
region of Riga, killed the occupants
and returned to thoir own positions,
without suffering any loss.
The Italians are keeping up their
strong infantry offensive, begun sev
eral (lays ago, on the Isonzo front.
Especially fierce have been the at
tacks around San Martino. Here
Rome says, the Italians captured
Dante Del Croviglio, the pivot in the
Austrian defense, and in tho same
region stormed two other places and
seized Austrian trenches.
Vienna on the other hand, declares.
that near San Martino, the Italians
seven times attempted to storm the
Austrian positions, but were repulsed
with heavy casualties.
