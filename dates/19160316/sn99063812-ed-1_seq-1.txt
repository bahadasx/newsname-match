WASHINGTON March 16. A race

Villa troops.
Fifteen hundred more Americans
are believed to have started, or to be
ready to start south today from near

The situation opposite Douglas Is
regarded as serious. Whether there
will be clashes there with Carran
zistas depends upon the control ex
ercised by the Mexican officers.

FOREST RESERVE
PLAN NOT LIKED
WASHINGTON, D. C. March 16.
Lands of the Oregon ft California
land grant will not be thrown Into
forest reserves. This can be safely
predicted from a canvass of the house
committee on public lands at the
close of the hearings.
The committee will take up the
Chamberlain-Ferris bill today for
consideration by sections in secret
session, aided by representatives of
the departments of Justice and Inter
ior. The lines of the Chamberlain
bill, with suggestions made by the
attorney general, will be followed,
but the amount tor Oregon schools
and roads is in doubt.
S. W. Williams of the department
of Justice was the final witness.
Speaking as an Individual, he opposed
any limitation on the time for cutting
the timber. He suggested that the
limit of the timber allowed on land
allowed as agricultural be' raised
from 1,000,000 to 1,500,000 feet. He.
opposed the plan of the forest service,
pointing out that at the present, rate
of sale from forest reserves, twenty
years will be required to .secure
enough money to pay the taxes on
land from the timber sales.
Highway to'
another meeting to be held April IS,
when the matter of deciding upon th
type of Improvement will be up for
consideration.

suggested the building of the road
