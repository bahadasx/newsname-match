JAPAN WANTS CONCESSIONS III
TREATY ALLIANCE
(Associated Press)
TOKIO, Mar. 17. Baron
Ishii, minister for foreign af
fairs, told the House of Peers
on February 13 that Japan is
negotiating with Great Brit
ain concerning the anti-Japanese
agitation in British colo
nies. The foregn office, how
ever, denies the report per
sistently circulated in Tokio
that fresh negotiations are
going on between Japan and
England for the revision of
the Anglo-Japanese alliance.
The idea put forth, as the
basis of the report, is that
Japan seeks from Great Brit
ain some definite recognition
of Japan's superior position
in China.
The alliance with England, as a re
sult of which Japan declared war
against Germany, continues a favorite
topic of conversation. A good many j
disparaging remarks have been made j
about it "by Japanese who feel that
Great Britain is asking and receiving
too much under Its terms and that it
has ceased to be an instrument usefuWion of Japan deseA'es to be fully rec
to the Japanese nation.
Baron Ishii referred to these criti
cisms in his remarks before the Peers.
He deprecated them, he said, as be
ing exceedingly regrettable because
they do harm to the friendly sentiment
between the two nations. He regret
ted also that British residents in Chi-
I na occasionally gave voice to unfriend
ly utterances about Japan. But he
pointed out that these criticisms
should not be interpreted as the opin
ion of the nation as a whole.
At a recent dinner of the Japan
Trade Association, Ochiro Tokutomi,
the editor of the Kokumin, declared
that there prevails an opinion among
a section of statesmen and politicians
that the Anglo-Japanese alliance has
become superannuated and should be
reframed to meet the changed situation
j of Japan the growth, or exaltation of
her position and influence in Far
Eastern affairs. He considered it most
probable, he saU, that the time will
. come before long when thU opinion
r will be seriously taken up and em
bodied in :the form of negotiators for
the revision of the ex'atini; treaty.
He insisted that this view was shared
by several members of the cabinet and
privy council.
The present negotiations with Eng
land to which reference was made by
I Baron Ishii are believed to include
the status and treatment of Japanese
emigrants particularly in Australia,
but refer particularly to an alleged
boycott of Japanese goods.

demanding a revision of the alliance

WITH E
with Great Britain is summarized by
the Nich-Nichi. It declares that in
Canada, Australia and other British
colonies Japanese are refused treat
ment on an equal footing; that the
British residents in China, official and
otherwise are bent on curbing Japan's
interests in that country; that Japan's
position in China is of vital importance
to Japan but that its predominence is
not recognized, and that moreover, in.
case of misunderstandings with the
United States over Chinese questions
the British government is known to
be bent , on avoiding tne responsibili
ty of rendering assistance to this
country.
The newspaper further alleges that
Britain is restricting Japan's free ac
tion in India. Under these circum
stances the journal deems it natural
that there should be a feeling of dis
satisfaction concerning the alliance as
it now exists. The paper further
points out that Great Britain on ac
count of the war is not in a position
at present to protect her interests in
the Pacific and has to depend solely
on Japan in that respect. In other
words, Japan is now the only nation
able to protect the interests of Great
Britain and other nations in China,
and the paper thinks that this posi-
ognized by Great Britain by formfj
allowing Japan to have her position
in the (Far East clearly defined.
As for the provisions in the alliance
concerning the peace of India the pa
per points out that they were made
when there was a fear of Russian ad
vance to the South. Those provisions
were made against a Russian menace,
.but the present relations of Great
Britain and Russia are practically
those of an alliance and the paper
finds no reason or necessity for hav
ing the provisions in the alliance con
cerning India. Moreover, the paper
thinks that the wording of those stipu
lations is rather ambiguous and calls
for a more explicit arrangement con
cerning Japan's obligations on that
point.
The Nichi-NIchi does not want the
treaty annulled, but it recommends a
revision so that Japan may receive
what it deserves as the only power in
the Far East that is now in a position
fully and efficiently to protect British
and other interests in this part of the
world.

FRANCE THAN EVER
! (Associated Press)
PARIS, Macch 17 Official figues
just given out by the Department In
spection show a revival of industry
and a decrease in the number of idle
workmen in France. More than half
the industrial aria commercial estab
lishments in the country closed at the
beginning of the war, when an average
of 24 per cent of the workmen were
called to the colors. 42 per cent were
thrown out of employment by the clos
ing ot the establishments, leavfng only
34 per cent continuing to earn their
wages. In about 50,000 establishments
inspected, 1,700,000 workmen were em
ployed in time of peace. The figures
fell to one-third of that number In Au
gust 1915 and then Increased progres
sively to 1,300,000 in January of this
year, which is 77 per cent of the nor
mal. Taking into account the 24. per
cent mobilized, there are actually em
ployed in Fxancehersheinsnetaoshrdlu
ployed in French industries one per
cent more of workmen than ever be
fore. These figures would seem incompat
ible with the fact that many industries
are still closed, but it is explained that
though building industries and a few
others have less work than when the
war began, other, industries have more.
It cost the government 3,784,000
francs to support idle workmen in
Paris alone during the second half of
January 1915. In the second half of
January 1916 this allowance had fallen
to 1,524,000 francs. In some other
cities the number of people out of em
ployment has been reduced to 10 per
cent.
Excepting among such employes as
garment workers in Paris and kin
dred industries, all wages are higher
according to the official figures .
PRICE OF KluCO
A1SES IN GERMANY
(Associated Press)
HAMBURG, Germany, March 17.
Manufacturers and reailers have in
creased the price of cigars because of
the further rise in Dutch exchange.
The cigar that formerly retailed for 15
pfennigs, is sold today for 16, and on
the more expensive grades the ad
vance is greater.
The German tobacco market, of
which Hamburg is the center, had
large supply of tobacco on hand when
the war began but these were used up
about a year ago and since then Ger
many has been obliged to depend
chiefly upon such tobacco as came
from Holland. In addition to the in
crease caused by the rise in Dutch ex
change, there may be still further ad
vances because there is talk of a high
er duty upon tobacco in all forms.
