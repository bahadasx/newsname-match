that colds do not result from
cold weather. That is rank fool
ishness. Were it true colds

get rid of a cold take Chamber

fectual and is highly recommend
ed by people who have used it for
many years as occasion required
and know its real value. Obtain

has been made favorable to his

ment relative thereto. His friends
are numerous in Wright county,
and they are confident that he
would make an excellent showing
should he conclude to enter the
race.

Ben Moore, a well known Hart
township Republican, is consid
ering announcing his candidacy
for the office of sheriff of Wright
county. Ben is a stalwart Re

good raads booster and has done
