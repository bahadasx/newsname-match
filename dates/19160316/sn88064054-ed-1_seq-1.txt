i. "One of the most important things c
-t I in connection with trade extension,"
te wrote Mr. Sullivan, "is to increase
is the tonnage from the forests. Near- ed
e ly all large concerns are now manu
n facturing into lumber about all the
re ! portion of the tree that can be done of
economically, but when shipment is bo
completed, we find that only 33 per Ti
of the tree is loaded on the car for
shipment. The other is wasted."
"The U't , d States Forest Service
a- Department has done splendid work ý'
er in advising lumbermen that a large ttt
us percentage of this waste, probably ýt
e equal to the lumber production, u
se could be manufacturd into paper at
k a profit. In the pine producing
t- states of the South there is more
Y good wood wasted every year than
or, is manufactured into pulp in the
gs, whole United States. On the coast,
11, where such large quantities of pine
k' and fur are cut at present, the limbs
n- and tops are all wasted, and pro
il- bably there is more wood wasted
8g. on the coast than is manufacturedd
in- into pulp in this country."
"The United States Government." a
Mr. Sullivan wrote, "being the larg

Co. ing than an operating concern.
n- Through the forest service depart

he has been appreciated by all lumber

usa gone far enough. If the govern

rd- At a meeting held at the Y M C
A last night steps were taken to
the wards giving Bogalusa one of the
res. best ball teams in the history of the
ing city. Committees were appointed
ids. to devise plans for the raising of
out funds with which to purchase new
iss. uniforms. It has been decided to
ids. have no players on a salary and in
at this manner it is believed that the
En- support given the team, after the
nd- organization is prefected, will pay
all expenses. It will be necessary
to raise a neat little sum to equip
the team at the start.
Bogalusa had a fine team last
yeAr and only met defeat a few
will times, This season it is expected
ited that we will have a better team and
St. already games are being considered.
