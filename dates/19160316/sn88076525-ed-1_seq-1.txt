WORLD—VOLUME VI. NUMBER 11
STILL AFTER
THE LEAGUE
^DECLARES THAT LEADER, OF
FICIAL PUBLICATION, IS NOT
OWNED BY LEAGUE.
The Normanden, the local Norwe
gian semi-weekly, published at Grand
Forks, which a few days ago publish
ed startling charges against the non
partisan league, last night printed still
further chrges.
The Normanden charged that the
Non-partisan Leader, the official or
gan, is not owned nor published by the
league, but iB issued by the Nonparti
san Publishing company, a co-partner
ship concern owned and financed by F.
F. Wood of Deering and W. R. Beele
of Badland Postoffice.
It is further charged by the Nor
manden that the Nonpartisan Politi
cal league is without any by-laws,
without any articles of incorporation
and that there is no provision for the
election of officers and no time limit
.for the present executive committee.
Thes Normanden, in continuing its
-charges, declares that the leaders of
the league will not stand for any can
didate put into the field by the Repub
licans, and particularly Burdick. The
league, the publication charges, of
fered the Republican nomination for
governor to Steen Nelson of Finley,
but that he turned it down, because
he said he was a member of the Pro
gressive wing of the Republican party
and that Burdick was the choice of the
Progressives.

LONDON, SOCIALIST, IN OPPO­
SITION FOUR NEWSPAPER
MEN GO WITH TROOPS.
Washington, March 14.—While
there were indications in official dis
patches from Mexico today that the
defacto government was making a su
preme effort to capture Villa and his
bandits with their own forces, there is
no sign that General Funston's orders
to proceed on the same errand had
been modified in any way.
Word that American troops had
crossed the border was still lacking.
The war department itself has not
been advised as to when the movement
would begin.
Congress Takes Hand.
Congress took active notice of the
/border situation today for the first
time*. The house passed a joint reso
lution late today authorizing the re
cruiting of the mobile regular army
to full strength. This means the ad
dition of approximately 20,000 fight
ing men in the infantry, cavalry and
field artillery. The senate is expected
to confer tomorrow and the necessary
orders will be issued immediately to
fill up regiments on border duty.
Suggested By Staff.
The step was suggested by the army
general staff. It is urgently desired
now because of the weakening of the
border force by the expedition after
Villa, but ever since the patrol of the
border began, the army has been
greatly handicapped by the skeleton
organization of regiments, companies,
troops and batteries. The force that
•4,
Tuesday evening the school board held
an important meeting and many mat
ters affecting our schools were taken.
One of the important matters was
that of accepting the plans for the
new school building to be built north
of the present high school building,
and the clerk was instructed to adver
tise for bids for the building of the
same.
This building is needed as our
schools are so congested that it is hard
to do the proper kind of work. With
this building completed the portable
school houses where built to tempor
arily accommodate the overflow, can
be dispensed with and the pupils who
are now attending school in those
buildings can be transferred to better
quarters.
The teachers for the coming year
were re-elected, and in this connection
it will be with regret that the patrons
of our schools will learn that Prof.
Paul A. Teal has tendered his resigna
tion to take efect at 'the close of the
school year. Prof. Teal has had
charge of the science department in
our high school and has proven him
self an able instructor, and outside of
his school work he has been actively
identified with many things which has
a tendency to build up our city. He
has been an active member of our
Commercial club and also of the high
school band and orchestra. There
will possibly be a few changes in the
present corps of teachers, but gener
ally speaking most of those who now
have charge of the various depart
ments will be with us another year.
The board decided that the Easter
vacation this year would be for the
week beginning April 17. This is a
little later than usual, but this is on
account of Easter being very late.
HANNA REMAINS IN RACE.
Bismarck, N. D., March 14.—Ru
mors that he would withdraw from the
race for the United States senate were
quieted by Governor Hanna today
when he announced he still is a candi
date and promises a further statement
after the presidential promary, March
21st.
Nels Winton of Mazenod, Sask., has
spent the past week in this city visit

being less than forty strong.
Baker Holds Conference
Secretary Baker conferred today
with Senator Chamberlain and Rep
resentative Hay, chairman of the con
gressional military committees, and
later Representative Hay returned to
the war departent, accompanied by
Representative Kahn, ranking repub
lican member of the house committee.
The resolution was introduced by rep
resentative Hay immediately on his
return to the capitol. Its considera
tion was expected by unanimous con
sent and its passage followed with on.
ly representative London, socialist,
voting against it.
Send Explanations.
At the state department, steps were
taken to make it certain that distorted
versions of the American purpose in
sending armed forces across the bor
der were not given wide circulation in
Mexico. By cable, telegraph, radio
and mail full statements of all that
has transpired since the raid upon
Columbus and the attitude of the
United States government and its re
ciprocal agreement with the Carranza
government went forward to consuls
and sfcute department agents through
out the southern republic.
It is understood the department has
cautioned General Funston against too
full publication of his plans or of the
purpose behind orders to varibus units
of his force. Four newspaj corres
pondents were officially designated
during the day to accompany the ex
pedition and orders were issued for
their credentials.

Discerns Progress in Tropica.
At a banquet at the Union club, 1
commercial and agricultural body, Col
onel Roosevelt in a speech gave de
tails of the forestry work done while
he was President of the United States,
and also spoke on the acquisition of
the Panama canal. He expressed the
belief that the present century would
witness increasing prosperity in the
tropical regions, particularly in Trini
dad. He had been struck, he said, by
the extraordinary fertility of the is
land and the possibilities for agricul
tural and industrial development.
Must Restrain Disorderly Nations.
International progress, said Colonel
Roosevelt, depended just as much on
the refusal t. submit to international
wrongdoing as it did on -refraining
from committing a wrong. He added:
"If a nation is powerless, either to
hold its own or to secure respect for
the rights of others, or to do right
within its borders if it falls into a
condition of misrule and anarchy,
then it has no right to be treated as
a self, respecting and independent
power. In international matters we
shall have to take steps with regards
to disorderly nations that do not be
have themselves and are festering
sores in the international body politic."

HISTORY OF
CAVALIER CO.
COMMITTEE AT WORK OUTLIN
ING RESEARCH FOR PEOPLE
OF COUNTY.
Dr. O. G. Libby head of the history
department of the state university,
has returned from Langdon, where he
discussed the matter of a history of
Cavalier county with the residents of
that city. A local committee of the
Federation of Women's Clubs is at
work outlining the research which is
to be done by the citizens of the coun
ty. During his Langdon Dr.
Libby narrated the story of making of
a fortification which is one mile west
of 01 ga. The fortification was erected
in 1848 at the time a groupe of half
breed buffalo huntres were attacked by
the Sioux Indians.
Among the topics which the people
of Cavalier county are planning to
cover in their history are the follow
ing: Physiography, nature, races,
earliest white residents, political or
ganization, territorial organization in
1861, Statehood in 1899, etc. The
work is already under way and gives
promise of interesting results. Mr.
Libby declares that the state of North
Dakota is rich in historical material
which has not been used', but which
may be preserved by the various lo
calities and finally woven into a state
his tory of great interest.
