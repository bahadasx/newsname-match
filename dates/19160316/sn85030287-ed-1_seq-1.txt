Basket Ball
The basket ball game between
the court bouse officials and the
business men, played at the
school auditorium last Friday
evening, provided considerable
amusement for the spectators
and some good vigorous exercise
for the participants.
In the first half of the game
the court bouse officials took the
lead and at the close the score
was 6 to 3 in their favor.
In the second half their luck
changed and try as they would,
the ball insisted upon keeping a
safe distance from the basket.
When time was called, the busi
ness men had twelve points to
their credit while the court house
boys could count but six.

church will have a food sal at
