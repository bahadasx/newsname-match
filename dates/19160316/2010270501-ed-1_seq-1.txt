GRYDERMAN GETS DEATH SENTENCE
BEFORE WESTOVER AT VALENTINE
William Cryderman, who was
charged with the murder of Mrs. Nel
lie Heelan and Mrs. Anna Layport at
the Heelan ranch home near Valen
tine, was convicted and the death
penalty recommended by the Jury
which heard the case In Judge West
over's court nt Valentine last week.
This conviction marks the first
prisoner to face the death sentence
if Judge Westover's court in the
twenty years the Judge has served on I
the bench. Cryderman was sentenc
ed to die in the electric chair.
Feeling in Valentine was Intense,
and It is believed that if the Jury had
brought a verdict for acquittal a de
termined effort to lynch Cryderman
would have been made. Twenty-five
special deputies were employed to
guard the prisoner, to watch the Hee
lan family, and especially to watch
John Heelan, husband of the murder
ed woman, whose look of hate seldom
left the prisoner. Promises had been
given to Nellie Heelan's mother, at
Omaha, it Is said, that Cryderman
would not be lynched, and this, it is
thought, deterred some who thought
the prisoner deserved such a fate.
While facing the Jury the prisoner
was the picture of dejection, but in
the intermissions in the back room
he smoked and laughed and joked
with his guards and said it was not
necessary for the Jury to retire from
the court room, but they could ren
der their verdict in their chairs. He
invited all present to attend his fun
eral and asked for all the papers con
taining accounts of his crime and sen
FIREMEN IN MOVIES
AND DIDN'T KNOW IT
Friday Night Feature at Imperial
Show Actresses leaping from
a Burning Building
One of the most realistic fire scenes
ever presented on a motion picture
screen is Been in "The Woman in Pol
itics", an unusually powerful Mutual
Masterpiece to be shown Friday
night this week at the Imperial the
atre.
For the purpose of obtaining this
scene, the Thanhouser studios obtain
ed permission of the chief of the
Portchester, N. Y., Fire Department
to nse the entire department. Only
three men in the department, howev
er, knew that when the alarm sound
ed that it was not a real fire. This
was done, with the consent of the
chief, so that the firemen would work
with the same energy they always
display in fighting a real fire.
The scene of the fire, a tenement
located about a half mile from tbe
center of the town, was picked by the
director and when the "smoke
bombs" had been placed and the act
ors and actresses had taken their pos
ition, the alarm was rung in from a
corner box.
Within a space of a few moments,
fire lighting apparatus of all sorts
were dashing to the sound of the call
from various directions. And with
them came a monster throng of the
curious, that packed the streets and
necessitated the calling of the police
reserves to maintain order.
Several streams of-water were
turned on the "fire", long ladders
thrown against the building and tbe
occupants (in the form of actors and
actresses from the Thanhouser studi
os) carried to safety by the heroic
firemen, who didn't know of the hoax
played on them till one of them hap
pened to spot several camera men dil
igently working their machines from
a place of vantage on a nearby roof.
Then a stream of water waa turned
in their direction, but they escaped
before any damage was done. Never
theless, they obtained some of the
greatest fire scenes ever obtained for
motion picture purposes.

the
tence.
At the time the crime was commit
ted the feeling against Cryderman
was so intense that he was brought
to Alliance for safe keeping. A young
man by the name of Dunbar, who was
later sent to the reform school at
Kearney, was in Jail at Alliance at
the time and Sheriff Cox went to
Kearney after the man and took him
to Valentine for the trial, where he
testified that Cryderman told him
that the story that the motive for the
crime being a reprimand administer
ed by Mrs. Heelan over driving a sick
horse was a fake; that he had rav
ished Mrs. Heelan after he bad killed
her. A prisoner confined at Valen
tine testified to the same thing, say
ing that Cryderman told him only the
Monday before the trial.
The court room was crowded and
man 'were turned away. Everyone
entering was searched. The room
was cleared when the verdict was
rendered.V
Cryderman had been a vagabond
all his life. He said he had murder
ed his best friend, Mrs. Heelan. Tbe
night of the trial he threatened to
kill Madison, a fellow prisoner, lie
said that when he went to the chair
he would say, "Here goes nothing."
He was eighteen years old, and prior
to the crime had been employed as a
ranch hand by Mr. Heelan. He shot
Mrs. Heelan to death, fatally wound
ed her companion, Mrs. Layport, then
saturated their bodies with oil and
set fire to the house.

FIRE DAMAGED BUILDING
Fire Department Called Out Wednes
day Morning Two Time to
Anxwer Alarms
Fire of mysterious origin did dam
age amounting to less than $500 to
the building owned by Charles Wat
teyne at 406 Box Butte avenue Wed
nesday morning. The department
was called out at 5:09 o'clock and
had the fire out at 5:4 5. The build
ing is two stories In height and of
frame construction. The upper story
wad occupied by a family and on the
first floor Is Mr. Watteyne's shoe shop
and the tailor shop adjoining.
The damage to the building was
confined mostly to the rear. A burst
ing hose caused the tireboys some
trouble. They did good work and
saved the building from what appear
ed to be certain destruction.- The
dog "Mike", the flreboyB mascot,
had an unpleasant experience with
burned off wires carrying 110 volts,
which had fallen to the ground. Mike
now avoids anything that looks like
a wire. Firemen who registered for
the fire from Company No. 1 were
Guy Smith, G. E. Greer, R. C. Glad
son, P. M. Thomas; from Company
No. 2 were Bruce Mallery, B. S. Row
land, Charles Schafer, Carl Rockey,
and Lloyd Thomas; from the Hook
and Ladder Company were William
Maunier, John Williams, W; II.
Buechsensteln, Frank Hart, W. E.
Hall, F. L. Strickland, Tobe Gastln
eau, II. J. Young and Carl Thomas.
The department was again called
out at 9 o'clock by tbe explosion of a
gasoline stove in the residence of F.
E. Holsten, at Sixth and Box Butte.
The fire was stopped before the auto
chemical truck arrived by means of a
Pyrene extinguisher. Assistant
Chief Leonard Piiklngton, driver of
the auto truck, was at the Renswold
blacksmith shop having a wrench be
longing to the department repaired
when the alarm was turned in. His
experiences In reaching the city hall
were hair raising. He started in an
auto, which stalled, ran a block on
foot, was picked up by another auto,
which ran with him to the auto truck
room at the rate of twenty or more
miles per hour.
