Military Censor Is Stopping
All News Regarding the
Location of Army
Douglas, Arlx., March 15.—Ives
Q. Lelevler, Carranza consul
here, demanded today that the lo
cal express agent turn over to
him 300,000 cartridges consigned
to Gen. P. Elas Callee and order.
ed held last night by the Ameri
can military authorities. His re
quest was refused.
Consular Lelevler then tele
graphed to Eleslo Areedondo, rep
resentatlve of the de facto gov
ernment at Washington, asking
him to secure permission of Presi
dent Wilson for delivery of the
cartridges. Consul Lelevler said
that Gen. Calles had been In
structed by Gen. Alvaro Obregon,
Carranza's minister of war, to co
operate with American troops in
pursuit of Villa and that he could
not do so without this ammuni
tion.
HI "l^aso," ¥ex., March 16.—United
States troops, with camps broken,
were under marching equipment along
the Mexican border west of here at
daylight today in at least two posi
tions. Military censors prohibited
transmission of any information of ac
tual movements throughout the first
half of the day. The troops in readi
ness are at Columbus and Hachita,
N. M.
Gen. Gablra, commandant at Juarez,
said today he had received information
that American troops had not yet
crossed the border and that they were
awaiting permission from Carranza
before doing so. Gavira said he be
lieved Carranza's reply would be fav
orable.
Censors Are Evaded.
Despite the censorship, newB of 1m
portant military preparations all night,
passed through the New Mexico bor
der through travelers going in all di
rections. By morning would be spec
tators of the movements were hurry
ing to the international boundary and
giving circumstantial statements
about the hour when the columns
might move.
Late in the forenoon, however, the
Usual routine messages began arriving
here by wire from Columbus and they
cast considerable doubt upon reports
that advance guards were in Mexico.
Up to a late hour in the forenoon
nothing had come from the Mexican
side of the border to indicate unusual
excitement there or any Mexican troop
movements.
During the day the first aeroplane
squadron which arrived here from San
Antonio moved out of El Paso. Its ac
tual destination was kept secret.
Juan Bilbao, an El Paso cattleman,
arrived here today and said he waa
captured 200 miles out of here by ban
dits and had paid $1,500 ransom.
MEXICANS ARE QUIET.
Washington, D. C., March IB.—Ad
ministration officials still were with
out information early today that
American troops had crossed the bor
der in pursuit of Villa and his band of
outlaws. Secretary Baker, who re
mained at his desk at the war depart
ment until an early hour today going
over official dispatches and reports
from the border, announced that no
word had come that troops were mov
ing into Mexico.
Officials were gratified today that
the American note accepting Gen. Car
ranza's proposal for a reciprocal ar
rangement whereby either his troops
or American troops may hunt down
the Villa bandits on either side of the
border had been favorably received at
Queretaro, Mexico, where the Carran
za government is located.
Statements setting forth all that has
taken place since the Columbus raid
and of the Washington government's
attitude and its reciprocal arrange
ment with the Carranza government
were on their way to American repre
sentatives in Mexico. This step-was
taken to prevent the circulation of dis
1 torted versions of the American pur
$ pose in sending armed forces across
the border and to make plain the
peaceful purposes of the United States
toward all Mexicans except Villa and
his bandits.

EFFORT BEING MADE TO MAKE
U. &. PUNITIVE EXPEDITION
UNNECESSARY.
San Antonio, Tex., March *15.—While
the U. S. cavalry and infantry forces
today awaited Gen. Pershing's order
to advance, Gen/ Carranza's troops,
according to information received
here, work desperately to capture
Villa in order to forestall any entrance
into Mexico by American troops. From
official and unofficial sources, Gen.
Funston received reports of increased
activities of the de facto government
troops but there was no disposition at
his headquarters to regard the activ
ities as anything more than evidence
of Carranza's determination to cooper
ate with the United States government
in eliminating Villa.
It had been reported here that by
this morning the American troops
would be across the boundary line but
Gen. Funston had received no advices
and said he did not know Gen. Persh
ing's intentions.
Funston's orders to the commander
of the punitive expedition were, in ef
fect "Move when you are ready."
Little in the way of preparation was
left undone last night but there was a
feeling at army headquarters here that
Gen. Perishing might wish to delay his
advance until practically every possi
bility of a hitch in his plans had been
eliminated.
The general orders that have been
issued for the suppression of all news
that might interfere with the success
of the contemplated expedition into
Mexico have served to keep the public
in ignorance of the exact number of
troops that will be sent In under Gen.
Pershing but it is generally known
that the force will be not less than
5,000 and that the greater part of the
available troops in the United States
will be within reach if it should be
come necessary to use them. The
concentration of men and supplies is
virtually completed.
CARRANZA LEADER 8LAIN.
Marfa, Tex March 15.—The report
ed death of Col. Rojas, Carranza com
mander at Ojinaga, at the hands of
his own men, who attempted to mutiny
last night, was confirmed by telephone
advices here today. Rojas was trying
to control his men who were drinking
and threatening to invade the United
States when he was shot from the
crowd, according to the report.
METHODISTS LEAVE MEXICO.
Denver, Colo., March 15.—Word was
received here today of the arrival at
Eagle Pass, Tex., last night of Bishop
Francis J. McConnell of the Methodist
Episcopal church, whose jurisdiction
embraces Mexico. Bishop McConnell
is enroute here from Mexico City.
Officials of the church here ex
pressed the belief that all the mission
aries of the church had been ordered
to leave Mexico by Bishop McConnell.

STRIKE OF CORN PRODUCTS
WORKERS BECOMES MATTER
OF GRAVE CONCERN.
Chicago, March 15.—Fifty deputy
sheriffs are on guard at the factory of
the Corn Products Co., at Argo today,
where a strike is in progress. The
men ask a minimum wage* of twenty
five cents an hour with double time for
Sunday work and time and a half for
overtime. Failure of the company's
New York office to answer the strik
ers' demands is said to have angered
the men and the deputies were called
for.
The strikers yesterday picketed the
factory and are said to have refused
to allow food to be taken in to the few
employes who remained in the plant
during the night.
It is expected amass meeting of the
employes will be held at Argo today
to consider the demands of the strik
ing contingent.
The situation at Argo became more
critical early today when a number of
the strikers who had obtained liquor
began to shoot at random. The situa
tion grew more tense aB the men
showed signs of renewed anger at ru
mors that strike breakers were on the
way to the factory^. ,w

TEUTONS' ATTACKS

Masses of Ir.fantry Slain
By the Artillery From
the Allies' Lines

desperate struggle now in progress
northwest of Verdun and have recap
tured a part of the ground gained by
the Germans in the renewal of their
drive west of the Meuse, Paris an
nounces today.
Last night the French launched
heavy counter attacks and by using
the bayonet and hand grenades freely
were able to recapture portions of the
trenches the Germans had taken.
The Germans made heavy sacrifices
in attempting to cut the French line
and obtain possession of Dead Man hill
Paris advices declare. Possession of
this height has enabled the French to
sweep with their artillery the terri
tory over which the Germans were
endeavoring to advance against the
fortress.
It is still In French hands, however,
the French war office announces, al
though the German line has advanced
southward until it now takes in nearly
the whole of Cumieres wood to the
east of the height.
Big Guns Booming.
Artillery duels of great violence are
under way along the whole line. The
Germans gained a footing in French
trenches at two points. French avia
tors have again thrown bombs on the
station of Breulles, behind the German
lines north of Verdun, and four Ger
man aircraft have been brought down.
The Russians are still driving the
Turks before them oil' the Caucasus,
front and have gained some advantage
over the Teutonic allies in East
Gallcia.
The Italians are still making vigor
ous infantry attacks on the Isonzo
front and claim to have taken import
ant positions from the Austrians. On
the other hand, the Austrians say that
seven attacks by the Italians were
repulsed with heavy losses.
Pressing Campaign.
Berlin officially denies rumors that
the new German submarine campaign
under which armed merchantmen are
regarded as warships has been aband
oned or postponed. On the contrary,
it is now in full swing, it is declared.
GERMANS MAKE GAINS.
Berlin, March 15.—Important gains
for the Germans in the Verdun fight
ing west of the Meuse were announced
today t?y the war office. It is said
the Germans pushed forward their
lines west of Corbeaux wood and on
the height of Le Mort Homme, cap
turing more than 1,000 prisoners,

patch to the Exchange Telegraph Co.
says it is reported that Ismail Hakki.
president of commercial administra

Rumors have recently been In circu
lation to the effect that Enver Pasha,
Turkish minister of war, the military
leader who was stated to be the de
ciding force in the entry of Turkey in
to the European war on the side of
the central empires, has been assas
sinated. The rumors, however, have
been steadily contradicted.
Ismail Hakki Bey had held office in
several Turkish cabinets during the

VERDUN LEADER
SURE OF ABILITY
TO BEAT OEF FOE
COMMANDER OF FORTRES8TELL8
NATIONAL DEPUTIES THAT
HE 18 CONFIDENT.
Paris, March 15.—The renewal of
the fighting west of the Meuse after
three days' pause is regarded as her
alding the opening of the third phase
of the battle for Verdun. The defend
ers have profited by the relative inac
tion to strengthen further weak joints
In their armor and they await events
with full confidence.
"Now I know where I stand. I am
certain of final success," said Gen.
Petaln, who Is in charge of the French
operations at Verdun, to Messrs. Lau
raine and Pate, members of the cham
ber of deputies, who returned to Paris
yesterday from an inspection of the
supply arrangements at the fortress
and who declare themselves edified by
all they saw.
The first appearance of the German
infantry yesterday, after the usual
intense bombardment, occurred at 4
o'clock in the afternoon and the fight
ing lasted for three and a half hours.
They attacked along the whole line
from Bethlncourt to the crest of
Cumieres. a distance of about four
miles. There was every indication, ac
cording to latest advices, that the
struggle would be resumed during the
night.
The heaviest fighting was around
Dead Man hill, the Germans debouch
ing masses from Corbeaux and other
smaller woods to the west. They were
obliged to cross open ground and a
well directed fire from the French
did fearful execution among them.
Their ranks quickly filled up, however,
and although they were stopped again,
they ended by getting a footing in ad
vanced French trenches at two points.
Dead Man hill, which is now being
contended for. is a fine artillery posi
tion and nothing more, the military
critics say, for ijt Is not Joined to any
thing. It is a plateau whose base Is
limited on its four faces by four ra
vines and it rises only at the eapt,
dominating there the precent German
notations. Tharerown jrJnee's^lte .lB
evidently to make a breach In the
French line between Bethlncourt and
Dead Man hill to enable his troops to
advance in a southeasterly direction
toward Chattancourt and envelop the
French left there, while German forces
from Regneville and C»mleres try to
turn the French positions between
Cumieres and Dead Man hill.
It is announced that Gen. Gallieni,
minister of war, Is still indisposed and
unable to attend to his
duties.<p></p>INICIMT

Early Call to Arms Government
May Change Plans.
London, March 15.—The unexpect
edly early calls on married men to
join the army have created such grave
dissatisfaction throughout the country
that the government is considering a
change of policy. Earl Kitchener and
the Earl of Derby who speak In the
house of lords today are expected to
make important statements.
It seems quite certain that the
strong feeling of the country as to the
unfairness of the existing system of
recruiting has compelled the govern
ment to reconsider its position but
whether the revised policy looks in
the direction of the application of
compulsion to married and single men
alike is still unknown.
