There are no snakes in Ireland. It is related by tradition that they were driven out by the priest of old who later
became Ireland's patron saint.
The artist here has depicted anew St. Patrick, who has arisen' in North Dakota. This state is full of snakes
pestilential, poisonous snakes who creep around in the grass, who lurk behind rocks to strike at good men. The artist
shows you the names under which some of these snakes are known. They form the slimy horde of big business and
crooked politics which preys on the farmer and robs him of the best fruits of his production.
The farmer is th^new St. Patrick and he has a big club in his hands. The club is the Nonpartisan League. The
snakes fear this dub. See them wriggling in terror and trying to escape it. But the farmer knows their haunts and he
is driving them into the open and he will destroy them or drive them out of the state.
North Dakota is going to be freed of the snakes before long. The farmer St. Patrick will make a thorough job
of it.
An extra big issue this week full of exclusive news, pictures and features that
will please every League member. Your own stories and your gwn vie\ys. j5
