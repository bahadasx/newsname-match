- From Hef BijBanditsr
The small son of Mrs Maude Haw-ko
Wright arrived safely In Juarez today,
an interesting example of the respect
for childhood, which even the Villa
bandits showed when they captured
Mrs. Wright
After her husband had been slain at
Pachnca. Mexico, before the Columbus
raid, Mrs. Wright's child was literally
forced from her arms. The bandits gae
him to a Mexican family, which in turn
delivered the child into the keeping of
some of the Mormon colonists about
Casas Granites.
Mrs. Wright escaping from the
bandits after the Columbus raid, has
been here for a week awaiting the ar
rival of her Voj. i
Mrs Wright took her babj to Gen.
Gavira's headquarters before leturning
to the American side. The Carranza
general ordered his official pho
tographer to take a pictuic of both
mother and child and congratulated
Mrs. Wright on the baby's arrival

All's Well, Says lVrhlnir.
The first report from Gen. Pershing,
commandins the expeditionary forces
to Maj. Gen. Funston, stating that all
was going well, was received at Fort
Sam Houston this morning.
The report dealt with the strength of
Gen, Pershing's command, the disposi
tion of the various units and the offi
cers, the distance of the first day's
inarch, and the movements of the Cat
ranza troops.
All these matters come under the
censorship, however, and were not
given out
Glad .No Opposition Offered.
Brig. Gen. Pershing's start into Mex
ico without opposition from Mexican
forces was the big topic of conversa
tion today at Fort Sam Houston, head
quarters tf Gen. Frederick Funston.
Ever since he began planning the ex
peditionary movement. Gen Funston
has paid close attention to the attitude
of Gen. Carranza and his followers.
When Gen. Pershing w ired Wednesdav
that he had crossed the border and had
been joined bv the Carranza forces sta
tioned at Palomas, tin major general
evinced great satisfaction.

While the primary purpose of the
censorship ordered by Geu Funston
was to mystify Francisco Villa, it is

of a military oxepriment partlv to de

newspapers and people toward such
methods. That It met without any sort
of objection, and. In many cases, was
freely endorsed by newspapers, was a
