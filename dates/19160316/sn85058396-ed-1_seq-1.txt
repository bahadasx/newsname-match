NEW ASHY UNITS
RAPIDLY FORMING
Gaps Made at Border Yester

Contingents Bell Solv

CAVALRY ARRIVING
Twenty-third Infantry Pitches
Tents at Fort Bliss Troops
v Eager for Fray.
E1 Paso, Texas, March 16. New
and powerful army units were rapidly
forming today along the Mexican bor
der to fill the gaps left yesterday
when the first expeditionary army
entered Mexico from two points on
the New Mexico line. In El Paso,
Brigadier-General George Bell, Jr.,
moving in here on the heels of Brigadier-General
John J. Pershing who
lod the first force into Mexico, was
busy gathering a new organization
and attending to the supply problems,
tho food, water and communications
for more than 4,000 men, who today
were out on a virtual desert rapidly
getting farther from their bases.
The Twenty-Third infantry from
Galveston was pitching its tents at
Fort Bliss here. At Columbus, N. M
the Eleventh cavalry from Fort Ogle
thorpe, arriving during the night was
ready to move In after tho first army,
but it was not known here when the
Eleventh would go, or in which direc
tion. Columbus was today the im
mediate base" for Brigadier-General
Pershing's army.
Incidents of Crossing.
Incidents of the spectacle yesterday
as the dust powdered American col
umns went over the international line
reached here today via couriers. For
the most part these couriers showed
a desire to co-operate with the request
of. tbq mUitary,censors that they
should not reveal anything of military
importance.
From a hill overlooking the six
square miles where the army was still
encamped at 11 o'clock yesterday fore
noon, tho military organization ap
peared to civilian spectators like a
vast confused swarm of men and hors
es, grey cannon, wagons, mule teams
and ambulances. But at 11:40 a. m.
when the word was given to form for
the pursuit of Villa, tho apparent con
fusion disappeared. In a very few
minutes, each organization, cavalry,
infantry and artillery, ambulance,
signal corps and the cooks' wagons,
grouped and dove tailed Into a rapidly
lengthening column.
At tho van the red and white guid
ons of the Thirteenth cavalry snapped
In the still breeze. These cavalry
men (included the troopers who a
week ago today, outnumbered five to
one, drove Villa back into Mexico and
took a toll of lives from his men equal
to one VilllsLa for every two Ameri
cans on the firing line. Behind tho
Thirteenth marched tho compact,
brbwn columns of the Sixth and the
Sixteenth infantry, Next, at a trot, a
field battery swung into lino and then
dropped to slow pace behind the in
fantry "doughboys." Tho deadly ma
chines, packed in commercial looking
bundles on mules, attracted scarcely
a look from uninitiated Chilian spec
tators. Supply trains and ambulances
rolled in a long line bringing up the
rear. Vast dust clouds swept up from
the lino of march, at times obscuring
the troops.
Men Eager For Fray.
The feeling among the men seemed
typical of Uie remark by ono dusty,
perspiring trooper, who as he hurried
past a group of civilian sightseers ex
claimed: "We've got our chance at last" As
he spoke, a few women, wives of offi
cers, watched the departure smilingly
whilo their husbands were still in
sight and then breaking into tears.
Ono officer's wife lovingly placed her
husband's pistol Into place.
It was almost noon when the first
of the cavalrymen trotted acrosB the
line.
Mexican Prisoners Brought In.
While the troops were going out,
threo automobile loads of Mexican
prisoners, suspects held In connection
with Villa's raid, slumped down in
the tonneauB. Some of them were
bandaged from wounds. There was
no demonstration of any sort among
tho spectators over these prisoners.
Some wounded Mexicans wero pick
ed up yesterday in the country ad
jacent to Columbus. They apparently
had been hiding out for several days.
Some of them probably were hit dur
ing fights with posses which scoured
tho Columbus country for several days
after tho raid.

SEA LIONS INVADE
IIGHTKEEPER'SHOME
San Francisco, Cal., March 16. The
keeper of tho lighthouse on Ano
Nuevo Island, below Pigeon Point, on
the California coast, has appealed to
federal officials here, it became known
today, for relief from tho sea lions
which the law forbids his killing, and
which have increased and multiplied
to such an extent that they threaten
to take full possession of the island.
Even his private quarters are In
vaded by the pups, he declared in a
communication received here today.
When he opens the door a troop ot
young seals march into the house and
at meal times the entire colony sur
rounds his domicile, barking for ad
mittance. Sleep, he complains, was
at a premium, for he declared the
slightest disturbance during the night
was tho signal for a sea Hon chorus
beside which an alarm clock was as
the cooing of a dove.
The problem will be passed up to
the Department of Commerce and
Labor.
MRS. WRIGHT'S
BABY RETURNED
Villa Bandits Care Tenderly
for Child Which They Forced
From Mother's Arms.
El Paso, Tex., March 16. The baby
of Mrs. Maude Hawk Wright arrived
safely in Juarez today, an interesting
example of the respect for childhood
which even the Villa bandits showed
when they captured Mrs. Wright
After her husband had been slain at
Pachuca, Mex before the Columbus
raid, Mrs. Wright's baby was literally
forced from her armB but the bandits
treated It tenderly and gave It to a
Mexican family, which in turn deliv
ered the child into the keeping of
some of the Mormon colonists about
Casas Grandes. Mrs. Wright, escap
ing from the bandits after the Co
lumbus raid, has been here for a week
awaiting the baby.
Mrs. Wright brought her baby to
General Gavlera'a headquarters be
fore returning to the American side.
The Carranza general ordered his
official photographer to take a picture
of both mother and child and con
gratulated airs. Wright on the baby's
safe arrival.

MEXICAN FORCE
NOTWITHTROOPS
El Paso, Tex., March 16. It was
stated at the headquarters of General
Gavlora, Carranza commander at
Juarez, today, that no information has
been received of any Carranza troops
having Joined tho American expedi
tion. General Bertani, who was re
ported to have joined General Persh
ing, arrived here last night with seventy-five
men from Guzman.
General Caviera asserted today that
his attitude had been misrepresented
insofar as ho had been declared to be
friendly toward tho American expedi
tion. He Bald that he believed the
troops of Oenoral Carranza wore well
able to take care of the Villa situa
tion but, that aB General Carranza
chose to co-operate with the Amer
icans, he had issued such instructions
to the officers of his district. He
omrhasized that these instructions
had ao bearing on his personal views.

KINGSVILLE ATTACKED
American Patrol Disperses
Bandits at Bridge on St.
Louis, Brownsville &
Mexican Railroad.
San Antonio, Texas, March 16. Brigadier-General
Pershing's start into
Mexico without opposition from Mexi
can forces and apparently without
serious disturbances resulting along
the border, was the big topic of con
versation today at Fort Sam Houston,
headquarters of Major-General Fred
erick Funston.
Ever since ho began planning tho
expeditionary movement, General Fun
ston has paid close attention to the
attitude of General Carranza and his
followers. When General Pershing
wired yesterday that he had crossed
the border and had been joined by the
Carranza forces stationed at Palomas,
the major-general evinced great satis
faction. This was heightened today
when early reports Indicated that the
only violenco along the entire border
occurred near Kingsville, Texas,
where a small detachment of troops
guarding the Barredo bridge on the
St Louis, Brownsville and Mexico
railway was fired on in the dark
about midnight
First stories of this affair were that
at least one hundred shots were ex
changed before the attackers, said to
be Mexican bandits, retired.
It was later announced from Fort
Brown at Brownsville that not more
than fiye shots-w.ere.-fJred, nono-takj
ing effect. For 'fear that another at
tack might follow reinforcements
were sent in from San Benito.
While tho primary object of the
censorship ordered by General Fun
ston was to mystify Francisco Villa,
it also was known that it was in the
nature of a military experiment partly
to determine the attitude of American
newspapers and people toward such
measure. That is mot without any
objection and in many cases was free
ly endorsed by newspapers was a sur
prise to General Funston who said,
when he announced the secrecy plans'
"I suppose they will haul me into
court for this."
General Funston today voiced his
satisfaction that, after the public ful
ly understood the situation, there had
been no expressions of impatience at
the failure of the expeditionary force
to make an earlier start
It was generally felt in army cir
cles that, In consuming only a week
in preparing for the search after Villa
and at the same time for the defense
of the border, tho southern depart
ment had done fast work. There was
a shortage of rolling stock in many
sections; there was no large force
available at any particular point; sup
plies had to be transported and
mounts for the cavalry had to be ad
ded. Washington, March 16. President
Wilson was informed by Secretary
Baker early today that both columns
of American troops now In Mexico in
pursuit of Villa and his bandits were
meeting with hearty co-operation from
the Carranza soldiers.
DUTCH STEAMER
IS TORPEDOED
Big Liner in Sinking Condition
Life Saving Boat and Tor
pedo Boats Go to Rescue
of Passengers.
London, March 16, 4:57 p. m. A
wireless dispatch sent from the Tu
bantla last night, as given out by
Renter's correspondent at Ymulden,
Holland, snys the steamship was tor
pedoed. The correspondent asserts
there were Americans on board.
The wireless message which was
signed "First Wireless Operator" was
received last night at Ymuiden my
way of Scheveningen, Holland, and is
quoted as follows:
"Tubantia torpedoed and lost Am
now leaving ship with captain. Don't
worry."
Among the passengers, Router's
correspondent Bays, wero "sjome
American and German women."
"It is now certain that the Tuban
Ma was torpedoed without warning,"
-elegraphs the Amsterdam correspon
lent of the Central News. "There
were three Americans on board. Thoy
were Richard Schilling; nn American
consul; Emma Schilling and Carmen
Schilling."
London, March 16, 11:10 a. m. A
Reutcr dispatch from the Hook of
Floland says that a wireless message
has been received there stating that
tho large Dutch passenger steamship
Tubantia, outward bound from Am
sterdam to the river Plate, has been
torpedoed and is in a sinking condi
tion near the Noorhinder lightship.
All the passengers have been taken
off In boats.
The London agents of the steam
ship Tubantia, which is owned by the
Holland Lloyd of Amsterdam, have re
ceived a message saying the vosBel
struck a mine and is sinking. Anoth
er dispatch says the Tubantia was tor
pedoed. The steamship which is of 15,000
tons grosB, left Amsterdam yesterday
for Buenos Ayres. She was to have
stopped at Falmouth and peninsular
ports where the majority of the pas
sengers were to have been taken
aboard.
A life saving boat has left the Hook
of Holland to search for the sinking
vessel and Dutch torpedo boats are
leaving Flushing to hurry to the res
cuo of the shop's passengers in the
lifeboats.
A later Reuter dispatch from The
Hague says the Dutch ministry of
marine has received information that
two of the Tubantia's boats, with sur
vivors, have reached Noordhlnder
lightship. The Dutch steamship Kra
kateau, which is standing by, passed
another Dutch steamer which had
many survivors on hoard. A Swedish
steamship also Is searching for sur
vivors. The London agents of the Tubantia
state that the crew numbered about
300. They have no information as to
the number of passengers who em
barked at Amsterdam.
A Reuter dispatch from Ymueden,
however, says that the Tubantia car
ried 42 first class, 33 second class and
eight third class passengers.
The steamer carried a general cargo
and mails.
Later Lloyd's reported that the Tu
bantia has gone down and that all
the passengers and crow are safe.
It Is learned that a number of
Americans intended to board the
Tubantia at Falmouth, but it is not
known whether any Americans were
on board when she left Amsterdam.
Tubantia Goes Down.
The Tubantia was built at Glasgow
Tn 1913 and Ib 640 feet long and 65
feet beam. She left Buenos Ayres on
February 4 for Amsterdam and was
reported as having passed Fernando
Noronha on February 14.
The Hague, March 16, via London,
12:02 p. m. The Tubantia was still
floating at 8:30 o'clock this morning.
It Is uncertain whether she was
struck by a mine or a torpedo.

KAISER WILL NOT
PROVOKE BREAK
Is Determined to Maintain
Friendship With United
States in Spite of Strong
Opposition.
Plan of Von Tirpitz for Mer
ciless Destruction of All
Shipping Is Not Sup
ported. Washington, March 16. Emperor
William's determination not to pro
voke a break with tho United States in
tho new submarine campaign oven
though It involves a factional contest
In the German reichstag, having al
ready brought about the downfall of
Grand Admiral von Tirpitz himself, Is
Indicated in today's Berlin dispatches.
The tone of these dispatches from
the German capital, although guarded,
is taken hero to prove tho supremacy
of the emperor, Chancellor von Beth-mann-Hollweg,
Foreign Minister von
Jagow and the army, which has boen
opposing the plan of Admiral von Tir
pitz and the navy party to carry the
submarine campaign to a merciless
destruction of all shipping, whether
neutral or enemy, bound to or from
ports of Great Britain and her allies.
Potent Augury For Peace.
The development is regarded hero
as a potent auguary for a peaceful
solution of the situation vith Ger
many. The passage of today's Berlin dis
patches by the Gorman censor is re
garded as showing the desire of the
Gorman foreign office to prepare the
American people for such a contest In
the relchstag as was recently seen in
congress between two factions over
tho armed ship question.
Emperor Attends Conference.
About a fortnight ago, It is under
stood, a conference was held in Berlin
presided over by the emperor, him
self, and attended, among others, by
Chancellor von Bothmann-Hollweg,
Herr von Jagow and General von
Faulkenhayn chief of tho staff, and
it 1b believed that Admiral von Tir
pitz, himself, was called in. The dis
cussion turned on submarine warfare
generally and particularly upon the
attitude of the United States.
Tho general understanding was that
it was the emperor, himself, who de
cided that overy effort should bo made
to retain the friendship of tho United
StateB. The result was the rejection
of the proposed extension of submar
ine warfare to affect neutral nations.
Von Tirpitz' retirement followed nat
urally the rejection of the plans he
had fathered,
THIRD BATTLE IN CAMPAIGN FOR I
VERDUN COMES TO ABRUPT HALT I

sons, Do Not Follow Up Successes West of the Meuse WKwm
Bombardment Slackens French Reserves Come H
Up and Win Back Most of Lost Ground H
French Artillery Violently Cannonades H
West of Douaumont Italians in Des- Wmm
perate Fight on the Izonzo. H
Paris, March 15, 5:45 p. m. The
third battle in the campaign for Ver
dun, which is generally thought to
have begun on Tuesday, has failed
altogether to develop. So far the
Germans, whether from sheer exhaus
tion or for other reasons, have not
attempted to follow up their successes
west of the Meuse, even their bom
bardment slackening.
Meanwhile tho French reserves,
which, In tho opinion of some critics,
are kept much too far in the rear out
of the reach of the curtain of fire,
came up and won back most of tho
lost ground, accordingto reports from
the scene of the fighting.
Germans In Abrupt Halt
The abrupt halt in the German of
fensive after what, according to the
official reports, were the small suc
cesses won is regarded by military
opinion here as a highly significant
symptom, it being considered that
from the heavy forces engaged In
Tuesday's attack, tho Germans had a
greater objective than the capture of
forward advanced trenches.
Paris, March 16, 2:30 p. m. There
has been no further infantry action
in the region north of Verdun, accord
ing to the announcement made by the
French war office this afternoon. The
bomhardmeht has continued, but with
varying intensity.
The text of the war office commu
nication reads:
"In Belgium, French patrols have
been able to ascertain that the de
structive fire directed by our artillery
yesterday evening against tho Ger
man forces at La Blage, in the re
gion of NIeuport resulted in tho com
plete destruction of the German com
municating trenches and killed a num
ber of the enmy.
No Infantry Engagements.
"North of Verdun there has been
reported no Infantry engagement dur
ing the course of the night The
bombardment has continued, but not
very strongly, on the left bank of the
river Meuse; it has been more in
tense on the right bank.
"In the regions of Haudremont and
Damloup, our artillery has cannonad
ed violently the country weBt of Dou
aumont where the enemy was engag
ed in perfecting defense works.
"In the Woovre wo have bombarded
several provision trains.
"East of the forest of Apremont, a
surprise attack against a German
trench resulted in our inflicting some
losss on the enemy and in bringing
in some prisoners.
"In the Vosges, the Germans deliv
ered an attack against our positions
near Burnhaupt. Checked by our cur
tain of fire, tho enemy found it Im
possible to set foot in our trenches.
French Attacks Unsuccessful.
Berlin, March 16, via London, 3:35
p m a number of unsuccessful at
tacks have been made by the French
on the German lines south of St
Souplet weBt of the Somme-py road in
the Champagne region, German army
headquarters announced today. The
Germans took two officers and 150
men prisoners and captured two
machine guns.
Today's official statement seems to
indicate that the Germans claim pos
session of Deadmau's hill, the dom
inating height west of tho Meuse on
which they reported an advance
movement yesterday.
The text of the statement follows:
"In Flanders, especially in proxi
mity to tho coast, artillery duels have
appreciably Increased in violence.
Thoy have become more violent in
the region of Roxe and Vllle aux
Dols. l . .
"In the Champagne the French, aft
er perBistent artillery preparation,
made a number of infantry attacks
all without success, on our position
south of St. Souplet and west of tho
Somme-py-Soualn road. This caused
us few losses, whereas their losses
were numerous. We took there two
officers and 150 unwounded prisoners
and captured two machine gunB.
German Claim Deadman Hill.
"On tho left bank of tho Meuso, fur
ther attempts to dispute our Posses
sion of the height of Le Homme Mort
(Deadman) and our positions in tho
wood north of it, were frustrated at
the outset
"Between the Meuse and the Mo
selle tho position is unchanged.
"South of NiederaBpach (upper Al
sace) our patrols, after an effective
bombardment of enemy trenches,
penetrated the latter, destroyed the
defensive positions and returned with
a few prisoners and some booty.
French Aeroplane Shot Down.
"In an aerial encounter a French
aeroplane was shot down southeast
of Beine in tho Champagne. Tho oc
cupants wero Incinerated.
"Enemy airmen last night again
attacked the German hospital at La-0
