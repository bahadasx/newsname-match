Villa has apparently passed

the Americans are safe there,

Spent Night Near Border
Columbus, X. M., March 1G.
The American expedition en
tering Mexico yesterday, spent
an ur.cvenliV.I night, camped
only a short distance across the
boundary line.
General I'crshipg accom
panied the force as far as the
border and then returned with
another part of the troops
which eniered Mexico to flank
the main army.
Despite the vigorous censor
ship it became known today
that about live thousand men
filtered Mexico and the aero
planes and motor trucks are be
lieved to have accompanied
them. The flying conditions
are ideal.
When General Pershing gave
the order to march yesterday,
the soldiers stepped forward
with a shout. Cowboys off the
ranges were enrolled as scouts,

regiments, and field artillery
and wagon trains followed.

OWNERS OF MOTOR CARS MEET,
ADOPT CONSTITUTION AND BY
LAWS, ELECT OFFICERS, MAP
CUT VIGOROUS CAMPAIGN.
A rousing and enthusiastic meeting
of the Ardmore Motor Association was
held last evening nt the rooms of
the cliamher of commerce and com
pleted organization. A constitution and
by-laws were adopted, and the tempo
rary organization, consisting of Mark
Kirkpatrick, president, J. W. Hum-Id,
vice-president, and ('. von Xordheim,
(ieeictary-trca.sinvr, was made the per
manent organization for the current
year beginning with March 1. In addi
tion to these, members of tho board of
directors were chosen, including I'. P.
Maxwell, Edward Halt, and Walter
t'ritclilow.
Many interesting phases of the ob
jects and purposes of the organization
were discussed. The name of the as
to; datum was fixed as "Ardmore Motor
Assoi iation." This was done in placo
of "Ardr.'.ore Automobile Associa'ion,"
a.; tlii' tiir. e initin! letters of this name
-miid iniirl'ere with the initials of
;( !,;;'. ioiia 1 organisation, ti e A. A. A.
it was also (iecidi d to purchase badge.;
( :i:npes,'d of i!:f initials "A. M. A." to
he furnished eaeh member of the asso
rialion, which may be fastened in a
conspicuous place on the member's
car. In this way any car belonging to
a iiK'ii.bcr of the association will be
easily distinguishable.
Such as badge alone would have a
decidedly deterrent effect upon any
one inclined to take a joy-ride in any
car belonging to a member of the asso
ciation. It was the unanimous sense
of the meeting that the association as
a body would take up the prosecution
of auto thieves and in every way pos
sible assist the city and county officers
in the prosecution and conviction of
such vandals.
The association voted to offer a
standing reward of fiiO.OO for the cap
ture and conviction of persons having
stolen a car belonging to any member
of the association. It is a well known
fact that bank robbers as a usual thing
leave institutions which are members
of the American Rankers' Association,
severely alone, owing to the fact that
their prosecution never ceases until
the criminal has been brought to just
ice. It can easily be seen that the fact
that you are a member of the Ardmore
Motor Association, would have an
eiaia'.lv deterrent tffect upon anyone
who otherwise might feel tempted to i
take a little "joy-ride" in your car, l
and incidentally cause you a repair bill '
of several hundred dollars.
Road laws and traffic laws were dis- j
cussed. And the board of directors
which v ill hold a meeting at once, will !
appoint a strong standing committee
w hose duty it will be look after the ;
enforcement of present laws, to see
that Ardmore and Carter County re-(
ceive their share of state road funds, i
to push any movement that will aid .
the construction or highways, and to
inspire and push other legislation that

I!o-opening of the great waterway
is regarded as an engineering feat
second only to the construction of the
canal. Millions of tons of rock and
earth have been torn out of the col
lapsed excavations. Xew dredges of
a size and capacity never before em
ployed have labored night and dav for
months. Steam shovels have drivn
their way into the obstructions where
there was ground .sufficiently fir:n to
hold them.
In the meantime the construction
work nt the terminals and about the
locks has proceeded without pause.
When the canal is reopened it will
have advanced in equipment far be
yond the point it had reached wh.?n
the slides began.
