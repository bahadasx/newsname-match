FUNSTON IN GENERAL COM-
MAND—CARRANZA WILL IIELP
The cold-blooded murder of 27 Amer­
icans at Columbus, New Mexico, will
be avenged by the United States. Just
as President Wilson and Congress
were considering the preparedness
S'ogram,
Pancho Villa stepped in and
the thine that made the blood of
every American boil. Villa and his
men crossed the border into the United
States and committed their wholesale
murders. "Make a living torch out of
every American," Villa told his men.
The sentries were murdered with,
knives noiselessly and houses were
fired. As frantic men and women rush­
ed into the streets they were shot
down by the murderers.
President Wilson at once ordered
the army to proceed onto Mexican soil
to capture Villa. He will be taken,
dead or alive If he is taken alive, he
will receive the same dose he adminis­
tered to the residents of Columbus.
General Frederick Funston, who
won fame in the Philippines, is in su­
preme command. He will direct the
operations from El Paso, Texas. The
soldiers are under the command of
General Pershing. Just how many
crossed the Mexican border is not
known, for General Funston has es­
tablished a strict censorship. News­
paper reporters will not be allowed to
accompany the expedition. Utmost
precautions have been taken to pre­
Committee Favors Large Packing
Plant.
The committee on the location of
the Equity Packing Plant will not
come to a final decision until about
.June 1. They have received briefs
from eleven cities and are considering
them. They have visited those cities
and have gone into the proposition
very thoroly. The committee, of
which Anthony Walton of Minot is
chairman, has spent nearly $1,000 of
their own money in making these in­
vestigations, and in order to get it
back, it will be necessary for the
plant to be a success. It is therefore
up to them to use good judgment,

vent any news of the movement of the
troops leaking out in press dispatches.
Funston says newspaper reporters in
New Mexico have been revealing every
movement of the.troops.
Carranza, head of the de facto gov­
ernment, has granted permission to
our troops to pursue Villa in Mexico,
with the understanding that his troops
are to be allowed to cross the bordfer
into the United States under similar
circumstances. Villa and his men
have gone to the mountains. Unci*
Sam will use nis army aeroplane
equipment to locate Villa. Fifty-four
army trucks to be used in transporting
supplies have been ordered.
General Funston has but a few
thousand men available, but the house
passed a resolution authorizing the
recruiting of the regular army to full
strength. This means the addition of
20,000 fighting men Only four news­
paper reporters will be allowed to ac­
company the expedition.
Bids Will Be Opened Saturday.
Bids for the construction of the
new hospital to be built by the Sisteds
of St. Francis in this city
will be opened Saturday. Father
Raith and Bishop Wehrle will be pres­
ent when the bids are opened. It is
understood that Architect Woodruff
has received a large number of bids.
The contract for the plumbing and
heating will not be let until March 22.
Guilder Olson for State Committee-
A large number of personal friends
of Gunder Olson, former state treas­
urer, who live thruout the length and
breadth of the state, are interested in
his candidacy* for republican state
committeeman, to come to a vote next
Tuesday. Mr. Olson is one of the
most prominent men in North Dakota
and could be depended upon to give
the members of his party a square
deal if
elected.
which they undoubtedly will do.
The Independent understands that
the committee does not favor building
a number of small plants about the
state, for the reason that it will cost
as much to install equipment for tak­
ing care of the by-products for a
small plant as for a larger one, and
the by-products proposition is very
important in making a packing plant
a success.

FOUR WILL BE SENT TO MINOT
FOR PARKS—PARK COMMIS­
SION ORDERED THREE ELK
The Minot parks will have four
deer and three elk for the main attrac­
tion in the Zoo the coming summer.
Nine deer were captured at Willis
ton today by Chief Game Warden Mc
Cutcheon and Assistant John Patter­
son of Stanley. The deer were seen
on an island in the Missouri river. The
game wardens chased them onto the
slippery ice and they were unable to
run fast. It was hard work but by
evening, nine of them had been roped
and taken to box cars. Four of them
will be shipped to Minot at once to
be placed in our parks. Pres. Lambert
of the park board has been notified
and he is having a place prepared for
them. They are all fine animals and
will be a great attraction in the city
during the summer months.
The Park board has ordered three
elk from Yellowstone park. They will
not cost the city a cent, except for the
work of capturing them and the trans­
portation here.
David Gibb of Sanish was severely
injured recently while putting up ice.
A huge cake fell, bruising his leg,
which was wedged in such a manner
that the ice had to be broken before
the leg could be extricated.

Notice to Retract.
To Fred Truax and G. D. Colcord,
Publishers of The Ward County In­
dependent, Minot, North Dakota:

Said statement being in words
follows, to-wit:
"Ross Editor Shot Town Bully—

terath in hip and then laid man out
with stove poker—Editor is blameless
—John S. Patterson, publisher of the
Rosa Valley News and Sanish Pilot,

IENCE MADE FAVORABLE
IMPRESSION.
Henry D. Estabrook, candidate for
president of the United States, gave
an address at the Armory before a
large crowd this evening. Mr. Esta­
brook is one of the most prominent
lawyers in New York City and no ad­
dress of whatsoever nature, that has
been heard in this city, has been more
eloquent.
Mr. Estabrook's address was unique
in more than one way. Never' once
did he refer to his candidacy for pres­
ident.
He ridiculed Wm. J. Bryan, but com­
plimented President Wilson. Mr. Es­
tabrook is out after Colonel Roose­
velt's scalp, evidently. While he is
opposing Senator LaFollette, in the
primaries to be held thruout North
Dakota next Tuesday, he spoke most
respectfully of the Wisconsin man.
Mr Estabrook is for preparedness,
but would not build up the army to
more than a couple of hundred thous­
and men. He would make our Navy
the strongest in the world. He would
hold the Philippines and add to our
possessions if occasion arises. He
stands for a reasonable protective tar­

the officers to the county seat town,
where he furnished bail for his ap­
pearance in district court.
Patterson, who was not the insti­
gator of the fight, is given credit by
many of his friends for giving the
"town bully" the worst of it.
Patterson has an excellent reputa­
tion and is held blameless for the af­
fair and will no doubt have little trou­
ble in getting out of his present diffi­
culty if the case ever comes to trial.
Patterson was in the hardware store
when Ritterath, somewhat the worse
for booze, entered, and demanded that
the editor use his influence in getting
a quantity of beer for him. Patterson
didn't want anything to do with the
fellow and tried to avoid him, but the
tough persisted and finally attacked
Patterson. The editor pulled a gun
and shot the fellow in the hip, taking
carq not to shoot him in any vital spot.
When Ritterath came for him again,
Patterson picked up a stove poker and
laid him out. The fellow was carried
to his home and Drs. Brigham of Ross
of Ross and Flath of Stanley worked
over him most of the night. He will
recover.
Ritterath is the fellow who chewed
a victim's ear off in a fi^ht several
months ago, and the publisher didn't
fancy going around the rest of his
days minus one of his perfectly good
ears, hence used extreme measures in
defending himself. Ritterath has a
wife ana several children. He has
caused no end of trouble at Ross."

The above contains a copy of a story
published in this paper sometime ago.
ager is Atty. Theo. Koffel, of Bis­
marck. Mr. Kolfel looks for LaFol­
lette to carry the state primary, pro­
viding more than 30,000 votes are poll­
ed, but says Estabrook will win if not
more than 30,000 are cast. The New
York man hopes to win in this state,
when he would carry his campaign to
New York state, where he says his
prospects are very bright.
Mr. Estabrook made a favorable im­
pression in this city. He advocated
nothing that could not readily be ac­
cepted by republicans and democrats
alike. There were no great outbursts
of applause during his address, yet his
speech was effective.
At the close of the address, Mr.
Estabrook was the guest of honor at
a banquet given by the Ward county
bar association at the Leland. At the
conclusion, Judge Leighton introduced
Mr. Estabrook, who gave a most de­
lightful after dinner talk, which ap­
pears in full elsewhere in this issue.
John E. Green, who has been a friend
of the New York attorney for many
years, also talked, complimenting him
highly and wishing him success in his
political venture.

Like hundreds of other news items, it
was printed as a matter of news and
we considered our source of informa­
tion reasonably authentic, but could
not at the time, take the trouble to
look into all of the facts. The story is
substantially correct. The Ross editor
did shoot Ritterath following a quar­
rel.. We understand that we erred in
the statement that the fight was start­
ed thru Ritterath's demanding that the
edtior use his influence in getting a
quantity of beer for him. The Inde­
pendent has no interest in the matter
whatsoever. Neither of the proprie­
tors of this paper is personally ac­
quainted with Ritterath and the article
was published without the least mal­
ice. It has never been the policy of
this paper to do anyone any injustice.
Rather than go to the trouble of con­
sidering further a matter that does
not concern the Independent in the
least, the undersigned publishers,
hereby make a complete retraction of
any part of the story which may be
defamatory.
