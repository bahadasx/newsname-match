POSTMISTRESS APPOINTED
FOR MALTA MARCH 10.
It is officially announced from
Washington that Miss Nathalie Pat
ton of this city has received the ap
pointment from President Wilson
for postmistress at this place and
the appointment has already been
confirmed by the senate.
Miss Patton is the popular book
keeper and cashier in the J. F. Kil
duff store and had the Democrats
looked for many months more they
could not have found a better or
more capable person to handle the
office here than the one selected.
This will be surprising news to a
few, who thought they had inside
dope on the appointment.
IRRIGATION AND RAISING
OF SUGAR BEETS.
Under the Milk River Valley Irriga
tion System.
With the completion of the Dod
son Canals in the vicinity of Malta
and Dodson to irrigate 25,000 acres,
and the Vandalia South Canal in the
vicinity of Glasgow to irrigate 22,
000 acres; with the Bowdoin Canal
for 9,000 acres and Nelson Reser
voir South Canal for 22,000 acres
near Saco being pushed to comple
tion, the Milk River valley finds it
self prepared to take its place as a
center for the intensive production
of food products for the millions in
our eastern cities. Not only this,
but it also aspires and intends to be
come a manufacturing center by en
tering the beet sugar industry.
To properly inaugurate, this move,
9 an informal meeting has been called
to assemble at the Court House in:
Malta on Thursday, March 23d, at 2
o'clock p. m., which all those inter
estted in irrigation and the welfare
'4 of this vicinity, are urged to attend.
- At this meeting Mr. I. D. O'Donnell,
supervisor of Irrigation of the U. S.
Reclamation Service, will inform
you of the experience acquired on
his irrigated farm near Billings and
on the 29 projects of the Reclama
tion Service which, when completed,
will irrigate 900,000 acres, are lo
I cated in Montana. Mr. O'Donnell
- has visited all the projects of the
Reclamation Service and by actual
" observation of conditions and by
contact with water users throughout
" the western states has .become fa
miliar with the requirements neces
sary to make an irrigated farm, and
therefore, also 'an irrigated project,
a success. Based on his experience
p, and observations, it is certain that
he will be able to give the water us
* ers of this vicinity valuable infor
mation concerning the irrigation of
their lands.
Mr. Jos. Pope, a beet sugar ex
pert, will explain the requirements
in the valley and will tell how busi
I necessary to secure a sugar factory
ness is carried on between the grow
er and the factory, the methods of
leasing land, and will show the prof
Iits to be derived from raising sugar
beets.
This meeting should revive new
additional interest in the progress
and possibilities of this vicinity, and
every one is requested to attena.

COMMERCIAL CLUB MEETING.
The citizens of Malta met at the
City Hall last Friday night to hear a
talk from Mr. McCroskey, secretary
of the Havre Chamber of Commerce
with reference to reorganizing the
commercial club at this place. He
was loud in his praise of Malta and
vicinity and thinks the prospects for
the growth of this place is without
end. He touched on several timely
and interesting subjects. among
them the possibility of an alfalfa
mill, better roads, and the drilling
for gas and oil. He pointed out
where the people of this locality
could err very easily by letting out
side capital come in and grab off the
oil and gas fields. He is of the opin
ion that the people of this place
should do their own prospecting.
He gave an outline of how thi
Commercial Club of Havre did road
work very effectively. It appears to
he a very good plan and would wort
in this county as well as elsewhere.
Road work is something that is sad
ly needed in this county and should
be encouraged as much as possible. *f
The business men of Havre would
furnish experienced road builders
"and the necessary equipment ana as
sist the farmers in the work and the
two working together would accom
plish great amount of good. '
Another meeting will be held in
the near future and at that time an
invitation will be extended' to the
farmers to be present.
J USTICE COURT DOINGS.
Justice Wilson's court was busy
Saturday forenoon with the case of
the State of Montana vs. John Hun
eke, in which Otto Munson was the
complaining witness. The case
comes from a fight staged at or near
the Black Coulee school house early
in February at which time Mr. Mun
son received the worst of the fracas
and at the trial Saturday the State
received the same dose administered
to Mr. Munson. It appears from the
evidence introduced by the State
that but two rounds of the mill were
pulled off, but according to the de
fendant and his witnesses there were
three rounds of the bout and rt is
the opinion that it was so fast that
the complaining witness was unable
to keep accurate count. Following
is the fight by rounds:
Round one.--Huneke comes out -
of school house and makes a reihark
when Munson swings at him with a C
lantern. Huneke sidesteps and ft
wards off the blow and returns with w
a stiff punch to the head. Both men h
clinch and go to the ground, Mun- a'
son underneath spitting savegely. a
Both men get up. This is Huneke's
round.
Round 2. Munson sheds his j,
clothes and wants to get at Huneke in
and leads the fight, each of the con- la
testants sparring for an opportunity tl
to do effective work. Another clinch c;
and both men down in the snow e
with Huneke again on top and both in
men scratching. Munson says
"enough," and is let up. Huneae's
round. h*
Round 3.-Munson puts on his
clothes and Hluneke goes into school
house to turn out the lights. Hune-.
ke emerges from building and Mun
son agains swings with the lantern .
and lands square on the head of his
opponent. globe breaks and the
fighters are again in the dark. Men 4
clinch and go to the snow, Huneke
astride his man and after a few sec
ondf of scratching Munson calls out
"h6 gouging my eyes out." Mun
son is again let iie entirely satisfied.
Huneke wins battle.
Attorney Kirton appeared at thec
court as second for Huneke and

County Attorney Wolfe as second
for the State. The referee (jurors)
were unanimous in favor of Huneke.
Kirton had the best of the argument
at all times. More expense because
a man gets his face scratched.
Two brakemen, Peter Purkett and
John McNight, were instantly killed
in the Great Northern yard at Havre
last week when the engine on which
they were riding, crashed into the
caboose of another train. Dan Sig
