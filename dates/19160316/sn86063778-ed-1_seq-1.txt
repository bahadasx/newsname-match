Death of Former Resident.
Relatives >n this city Thursday
received intelligence of the death
on Wednesday of Mr. L. M.
Dink ins. which occurred at his
home in St. Petersburg. Flo.
The despatch merely stated that
Mr. Dinlcins had died, but it was
known that he had been in ill
health for a year or more.
Mr. L. M. Dinkins was for
years a resident of Fort Mill
township and was widely known
throughout this section. For
many years he operated Dinkin's
ferry, on Catawha river, three
miles south of Fort Mill, and I
through this work became acquainted
with people from a
wide scope of the country. Mr.
Dinkins moved with his wife to
St. Petersburg, Fla., about 15
years ago, his daughter, Miss
Mamie, having married Mr.
Caldwell Henry, a prominent
business man of that city. Mr.
Dinkins was 70-odd years of age
and is survived by his wife and
a daughter, Mrs. Henry, of
St. Petersburg, and two sisters,
Mrs. Alice Sutton and Mrs. Lizzie
Ormand, both of Fort Mill.
Mr. Dinkins was a man who
was highly esteemed by all who
knew him and the announcement
of his death was received with
keen regret by his many friends
here.

in Fort Mill and vicinity. He is
a brother-in-law of Mrs. J. B.

UNCLE SAM IS AFTER
VILLA'S BANDIT MOB
As the result of a raid early
Thursday morning upon the
border town of Columbus. N. M..
in which a number of United
States soldiers were killed and
wounded and several civiHiuns
met death, the Administration at
Washington has decided to send
an army of approximately 5,000
into Mexico to kill or to capture
Francisco Villa, leader of the
bandits. The United States
troops will enter Mexico as soon
as necessary arrangements arccompleted,
probably before the
end of the week.
The raid on Columbus Thursday
morning by Villa was un-1
expected by either the troops
stationed there or the eivillians,
and the Mexicans had done much
looting and murder before the
people could put up an effective
defense.
The war department at Washington
has been practically assured
of co-operation by the
Carranza government to capture
Villa and the movement of
United States troops does not
mean armed intervention of
Mexico, the dispatches state.
The situation, however, is a very
grave one and the people of this
country will watch with great
interest the outcome of our
government's action.
