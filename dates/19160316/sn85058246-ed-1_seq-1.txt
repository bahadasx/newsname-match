Paris, March 13. Tho first officer
of tho Norwegian mark Stilus Is
quoted by the Paris Herald as ox
pressing the opinion that tho vessel
may havo been struck by a bomb
from an acroplano instead of by a
torpedo, as previously reported.
Tho first officer was on watch at

thought was made by an acroplano.
although he could see none Then
came a terrific explosion at about the
middle of the ship on tho port side.
A huge wavo swept over tho vossels',

The crew got into boats with great

as a mast fell. A French torpedo

To Full War Strength
i
Washington, March 14. While
thereworq Indications, in oltlctal dU
patches from Mexico today that tho
do facto government was making a
supremo effort to capture Villa nnd
his bandits with its own forces,
there was no sign that General Fun
Bton's orders to proceed on tho name
errand had been modified in any way.
Word that American troops hud
crossed the border was still lacking
tho war department itself not having
been advised as to when the move
ment would begin.
Congress took ncttvo nottco of thy
border situation today for tho first
tlmo. Tho houso passed a Joint reso
lutlon lato In tho day authorizing tho
recruiting of tho mobllo regular ar
my to full strength. This means tho
addition of approximately 20,000 light
ing men to tho infantry, cavalry and
Hold artillery. Tho senate Is expect
ed to concur and tho necessary or
ders will bo issued immediately' to
fill up regiments on border duty.
Suggested by Staff
Tho step was suggested by tho
army general staff. It Is urgently uo
sired now becauso of tho weakening
of tho border force by the expedition
after Villa, but ovor slnco tho patrol
of tho border began tho army has
been greatly handicapped by tho
skeleton organization ot regiments,
companies, troops and batteries. Tho
forco that occupied Vera Cruz had
similar difficulties, somo of tho com
panies thero being lesfl than forty
men strong.
Two other resolutions bearing up
on tho Mexican situation woro Intro
duced In congress.
Ono of theso by Representative
nrltten of Illinois, would authorizo
tho recall of troops now In tho Phil
ippines for servlco In Mexico. Tho
other, by Representative Cary of
Wisconsin, would authorizo tho com
mandeering of all arms nnd muni
tions of war in tho country.
