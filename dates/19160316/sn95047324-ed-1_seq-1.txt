in the Itinerary
SECOND ONE OF THE TYPE
Representatives of Bureau of Ed
ucation of the Department of
Interior and National Congress
of Mothers.
Eight Southern States will be
included in a joint , tour to be
made in March and April by rep
resentatives of the Bureau ot bd-
ucation of the Department of the,
Interior and the National Con
gress of Mothers in the interest
of home education and close co
operation of home and school.
This is the second tour of this
type, one arranged for last year
having covered the far western
and Pacific Coast States.
The first meeting to be held in
connection with the tour will be
at Leesburg, Va., where the citi
zens of Leesburg and Loudoun
county have already created a
vigorous interest in the problem
- of closer cooperation of home and
5 school. Other meetings have been
arranged for Bust is, Avon Park,
Fort Pierce, West Palm Beach,
Tampa, and other cities in Flori
da. The tour will end at Nash
ville, Tenn., where the annual
meeting of the National Congress
of Mothers and Parent Teachers'
Associations is to take place dur
ing the week of April 4-11. .
Among the speakers at these
meetings will be Mrs. Frederic
Schoff, Philadelphia, Pa., presi
dent of the National Congress of
Mothers and Parent-Teach era
Associations; Mrs. Milton P. Ilig
gins, Worcester, Mass., vice-pres.
National Congress of Mothers;
Mrs. Wm. F. Thacher, Washing
Ion, D. C. ; Mrs. David 0. Mears,
Albany, N. Y., vice-pres. National
Congress of Mothers; Mrs. Joseph
P. Mumford, Philadelphia, , Pa.,
recently elected vice-pres. of the
National Council of Women ; Miss
Bessie Locke, New York City,
Secretary of the National Kinder
garten Association; and Miss Lu
cy Wheelock, Principal of the
Kindergarten Training school,
Boston, Mass. Mrs. Schoff and
Miss Locke are also special colla
borators of the Bureau of Educa
tion. In discussing this and similar
movements for stimulating inter
est in education in the home,
Commissioner of Education Clax
ton declares:
"People have sometimes
thought that the education of
children depends principally up
on the school. They forget that
1he school is only a supplement
tary agency, one which has for
most children come into exist
ence in very recent years. It does
only that which the home finds in
the complex life of the present it
can not do so well. The home is
always the central educational a
jjency, the one that deals with the
little child first, that deals with
him most, that has him most of
the time during the years of
school, and is responsible for him
after he has left school.
"American children are in
school less than 4 per cent of their
time from birth to 21 years of
age. The home, the primitive and
primary institution for the edu
cation of children, is still the most
important agency for education
for life physical, mental, moral,
industrial, economic, social, civic.
Any agency, therefore, that would
promote right education most ef
fectually must find some means
of co-operating with the home
and of helping parents, who are
the most constant, and should be
the most effective, teachers of
their children."
No business is being hit harder
by the war than that of the pub
lisher and printer. Paper, ink,
metal, and other supplies used in
the production of newspapers or
ether printed matter, have soared
skyward. The cost of everything
the printer uses has increased
Iremenduously, but he finds it dif
ficult to get an increased price
for his finished product.

Need the Protection of the Pro
posed Tariff
CITRUS FRUITS IN FLORIDA
Orange Crop Has Been Heavy,
but Grapefruit Light; Citrus
Exchange Plans to Inaugurate
a Supply Department
"Florida needs the protection
of the proposed tariff on citrus
fruits to protect its rapidly grow
ing lime industry," said General
Manager L. D. Jones of the Citrus
Exchange yesterday. Mr. Jones
declared that the Florida grow
ers were with the Ca'iforuinns
heart and hand on the proposition
to halt the flood, of foreign lem
ons and to turn the proceeds of
the tariff into the fund for the e
radication of the citrus canker.
According to Mr. Jones, there
are several hundred acres of limes
in the State which will come into
bearing next year and predicts
that within three or. four years
this branch of the industry will
rival the production of the orange
and grapefruit.
Last year over 15,000 barrels
of limes were produced and ship
ped from the Florida Keys. Many
of these were handled out of Mi
ami by the branch of the Citrus
Exchange there.
Speaking of the citrus crop
here this year Mr. Jones declared
that the crop would probably
reach 8,000,000 boxes, or within a
million and a half boxes of last
year's banner crop.
The falling off from last year's
crop, he explained, has been more
noticeable in grapefruit than in
oranges. He estimated that seventy-five
per cent, of the de
crease was in the former. The
prices have remained high, ac
cording to Mr. Jones, and this has
made up for the loss in quantity.
Mr. Jones and President J. II.
Ross will leave Friday or Monday
for California, where they will
investigate the methods in vogue
in the California exchange's great
supply department. The Florida
Exchange plans to inaugurate a
supply department along the same
lines of the ones which it is claim
ed has saved California growers
hundreds of dollars. Mr. Jones
and Dr. Ross will be back in the
middle of April. Tampa Trib

Do Not Run Away From Your
Opportunities
The man who leaves the farm
runs away from his opportunities.
Just a year or two ago one of the
reasons given by Prof. T. N. Car
ver of Harvard for the migration
of country youth to the city was
the lack of opportunity for a ca
reer in the country. This lack of
opportunity is only apparent, ac
cording to C. K. McQuarrie. state
agent for the University of Flori
da Extension Division. In form
er years there was either no op
portunity for a career in the
country or the country boy was
blind to it. Certainly' that com
plaint can be made no longer. It'
the country boy trots off to the
city now, it is because he is blind
to his opportunities.
Think of the branches of, en
deavor that are onen to the man
who loves the country. Think of
the opportunities of improving
the rural schools, the churches, of
organizing farmers to improve
their economic and social life. The
demand for leaders has gone a
begging many years. The man
who builds a country road lays
the foundation for improved ru
ral social life, consolidated
schools, agricultural high schools,
live churches that really serve,
rural libraries, rural organiza
tion, marketing and purchasing
associations, rural credit, and a
contented, happy country folk.
Best of all he secures the com
munity against absentee landlord
ism, the greatest calamity that
can come to a people.
Horace Greeley counseled
young men to go west. Later the
slogan included the South. Let
us give the advice a modern ap
plication and say, "First of all,
young man, go to the country."
Thfi carnivnl snirit ran hiwli in
Punta Gorda, Thursday, Friday
and Saturday; and the stranger
in the city, observing young folk
in vari-colored costumes here and
there about the streets, might
have imagined he was in New
Orleans on the occasion of a
Mardi Gras celebration. And,
really it was the intention to have
a Mardi Gras observance here,
but unavoidable delays threw it
on a later date, which caused it
to be called Punta Gorda 's Phun
Phestival.
Starting on Thursday after
noon, with a grand parade in
which all the available automo
biles of thetown and Joe Addi
son's pony were used, the merry
making continued through the
following two days and up to a
late hour Saturday night.
In the parade were the "flow
er and beauty" of Punta, Gorda
winsome girls and handsome lads
klad in karnival klothes and, as
it passed along the principal
streets, it cited the populace to
partake in the festivities
that
were to follow. Judge Trabue,
E. W. Rountree, E. Wotitzky and
several other young fellows
sought to join the parade, . but
were ruled out because they re
fused to don the regulation cos
tume. Miss Maude Cochran, on
a Shetland pony, played well the
part of mascot; and many of the
ears, attractively decorated, were
subjects for comment.
The attractions on the carnival
grounds were of a varied charac
ter, and drew large crowds at
night. Among Jhese were:
Booth where pop-corn and
parched peanuts were sold by
.Misses Anna Mae Sikes, Alta Lv
erton and Bee Corbett.
Miss Byrdie Mobley had charge
of a booth, where one could try
his skill throwing bags filled with
beans at a figure provided for the
purpose.
Shooting gallery conducted by
Misses Anna Mae Laubach and
Ina Miller.
"Charley Chaplin" in effigy,
who for the "coin of the realm"
would permit the carnival pat
rons to pelt him with base balls.
This was presided over by Miss
Sal lie Jones.
"Cover the Spot" was a task
but few could perform that Dr.
Archer Smith charged every one
five cents to try once or ten cents
to try thrice. With five inetalie
discs, dropping them in a way to
cover up entirely a black circular
Spot, the person successfully cov
ering it was given a box of candy.
Miss Edna Wilder, as a Gypsy
fortune teller, looked and acted
the part well, and was liberally
patronized.
The candy booth was in charge
of Miss Grace Laubach.
Just For Comparison
With no disposition to unnec
essarily criticise what Lee county
people are doing in road building,
a Herald subscriber calls atten
tion to certain work that is being
done down there which has been
criticised by Lee county people
ous angle.and Secretary Gilbreath
of the Dixie Highway Associa
tion; and a comparison is made!
with similar work in the Punta
Gorda special road and bridge
district and what Mr. Gilbreath
said of the work here.
It is the Fort Myers-Marco
road to which reference was had
in particular and the comparison
is made with a road requiring
somewhat the same grading that
s being built east from this city
to Berniont.
The Estero Eagle of March 2nd,
argues that the Fort Myers-Marco
road is entirety too narrow and
that it is graded up to a danger
angle, and Secretary Gilbreath
nade about the same criticism,
and Bond Trustee A. B. Tucker
states that he was reliably inform
ed that the grading of this road
is costing nearly $1,400 per mile;
whereas, the Bermont road in this
district, it is claimed, is being
graded at a cost not exceeding
$100 per mile, at the same time
being provided with adequate

feather "ticklers," rubber bal-
loons, etc., were sold, was looked i
after by Misses Henrietta Far-
rington, Thelma White and Alma
Yeager. Here also were sold num
bered paddles by which boxes of
candy were disposed of, the win
ning number being indicated by
the turning of a wheel provided
for the purpose.
The refreshment pavilion,
where was served each evening
regular suppers, was in charge of
Misses Page Hobson, Bessie Fitz
Gerald, Neita Gillia, Elsie Gillis,
and Maud Perrin.
Saturday was the most eventful
of the three days. Besides other
special features for this last day,
in the evening there was an old
plantation minstrel show, in
which Misses Saline Jones, Eliza
beth Mayes, Thelma White, Doro
thy liasmussen and Messrs. Chas.
Bickley and Jacob Golberg and
Master Billy White took part.
Mr. Bickley impersonated a wo
man and sang a song so well that,
i not until he unmasked, did many
people know who he was.
Attended with the usual carni
val features, such as the throwing
of confetti, use of feather "tick
lers," brass band music and great
hilarity, the Phun Phestival of
1916 was a great success.
Given under the auspices of the
Junior Civic League, of which
Miss Nell Linquish is president,
the credit for the affair is due to
girls who are members of that or
ganization and to the several lad
ies of the Woman's Civic Im
provement Association who as
sisted, among these latter being:
Mesdamqs P. W. McAdow, Sa
die B. r arrington, J. II. Hancock,
C. L. Fries, F. L, Laubach, T. It.
Woodson, F. D. Robinson and
Mrs. Sallie G. Jordan. Mrs.' II.
M. Reid, Mrs. A. F. Dewey and
Mrs. Jay Gleason, who are not
members of the organization, ren
dered valuable assistance. Mrs.
McAdow and Mrs. Farrington, in
directing and advising with the
preliminaries, gave indispcnsible
aid.
The proceeds, amounting to
nearly $150, will be divided be
tween the funds for th-; bath
house and for the erection of a
fountain in the city hall park-
Such a success was this carni
val and such enthusiasm did it
develope that it is now intended
to repeat it, next year on a larger
scale and make it an annual e-
vent each succeeding spring, de
signating it by a name distinc
tive of Punta Gorda and bv
which name it will be associated
with this place wherever it may
be mentioned.
A word to the wise is a waste of
breath.
drainage; and Secretary Gil
breath, who by reason of his trav
els and experience in road mat
ters knows whereof he speaks,
commended unqualifiedly the
methods adopted in this district
and stressed the wisdom of pro
viding widened roadways, as has
been done.
It would seem that, in the spec
ifications used in Lee county,
some mistakes were made, and
these may be due to engineering
advice. Advice from the same
source is said to have been offer
ed in the case of the roads being
built in this vicinity or, it may
be that it was simply a sugges
tion of what could or should be
done. Mistakes may have been
made ih this district, for "the
man who never made a mistake
never accomplished anything,"
as the Eagle puts it; but it is
rather gratifying that authorities
like Mr. Gilbreath saw nothing to
criticise in the methods and plan
of construction used here.
It is really the fond hope of
every citizen of this section,
whether he approves all that has
been done or not, to have to show
Mr. Gilbreath when he returns
here a year from now, a system of
roads far towards completion,
which will be second to none of
similar construction anywhere.
Bill for the Consolidation
of Forest Lands
I A MATTER OF IMPORTANCE
Strong Pressure Will Undoubted
ly be Brought to Get the Fish
Hatchery Located in Some
Florida City
The Washington correspond
ent of the Tampa Tribune, writ
ing under date of the 12th inst.,
says :
Nothing that the Florida Con
eressmen have done at this ses
sion could be of more local im
portance than the passage of the
Fetcher Fish Hatchery Bill, and
the bill for the consolidation of
the forest lands, both measures
having received the sanction of
the upper house.
For the fish hatchery there will
be appropriated within the next
few months the sum of $50,000
for the purchase of a site, the con
struction of buildings and ponds
and general equipment.
No particular location has yet
been selected for the location of
the hatchery, as this matter will
be left to the discretion of the
Secretary of Commerce. Un
doubtedly strong pressure will be
brought to secure it for some city
in Florida. t
The State of Florida must ac
cord to the United States Bureau
of Fisheries the right to conduct
the fish hatching and all opera
tions connected therewith at any
time that may be desired.
Because of the fact that the
National forest of Florida will af
ford an excellent opportunity for
stock raising, in the judgment of
Government , officials, the bill
which has also just passed the
Senate, .to consolidate the forests,
is , of prime importance. Lands
which are now owned by the
United States may, under this
act, be exchanged for those pri
vately owned, of the same value,
to be determined by the Secretary
of Agriculture within the exterior
limits of the national forest, which
lands, upon the consummation of
the exchange, shall become part
of the Florida National Forest.
Although many local bills have
been introduced since the present
session of Congress began, there
are none that in actual results,
will be of so much benefit to the
whole State of Florida as these.
Practically every State in the
Union which now has no fish
hatchery is trying to secure one,
and everywhere . the question of
stock raising, which will be af
forded by the consolidation of the
forest lands is receiving marked
attention.
Farmers Make Two Potato Crop3
in Six Months
Some farmers in the Hastings
district will make two crops of
potatoes this winter. A. P. Spen
cer, district agent for the Univer
sity of Florida Extension Division
reports that several farmers who
planted during the first of Decem
ber had their vines killed by a re
cent frost. The potatoes were not
very big, but they were market
able and were dug. Those farm
ers intend to plant again and, it
they do, they will get a second
crop by early June.
The first crop will not be heavy,
probably forty to fifty bushels to
the acre, but two crops of Irish
potatoes in a whiter is remarkable
even if one is small. Mr. Spencer
says that Hastings growers are
feeling good. They have the
largest acreage in the history of
the district, indications are fair
for a big crop and prices promise
well.
A newspaper is in no sense an
object of charity. It earns twice
every dollar it receives, and is
second to no enterprise in contrib
uting to the upbuilding of a com
munity. Its patrons reap far
more benefit from its pages than
its publishers, and, in asking for
the support of the community in
which it is published, it asks for
no more than in all fairness be
longs to it, though generally it
receives much less Manatee.

FIGHTING AGAIN AT RIGA
Renewal of Fighting Between

Artillery Bombardments on
Other Fronts Other War News
London, England Artillery ac
tivity continues on the Verdun
front. West of the Meuse tho
cannonading has been violent and
a reconnaissance on the part of
the Germans in the wood of
Ilaudremont was checked by tho
French, according to official an
nouncement made in Paris.
There was severe cannonading
near Vaux and also in the Woevre
district.
In the wood of Le.Pretre a Ger
man detachment advancing on a
French trench was driven back.
The Germans are making an ef
fort to batter down tho French
positions on Dead Man's hill, so
as to break the line defending the
western approaches to Verdun.
The French artillery is replying
with vigor. In the other sectors
there is a lull in activity. The
French believe the German as
sault has spent itself and that
there will be no more intense
fighting for the present in the
Verdun region.
There has been a renewal of ac
tivity on the German-Russian
front in the vicinity of Riga,
where artillery duels have been
resumed with much vigor. There
has been some fighting to the.
south, along the Stripa. river, and
the Russians are claiming some
minor successes.
With the coming of warmer '
weather there is ; a renewal of
fighting between the Italians and
the Austrians. As on the other
fronts, however, it is mostly
bombardments by artillery and
there has been very little move
ment of infantry.
lhere is little reported from
the Russian-Turkish field of op
erations in Armenia,, or the British-Turkish
field in Mesopotamia.
Greece Refuses Demands of En

Berlin Germany Premier
Skouloudis of Greece is said by
the 0 verseas News agency to have
intormed the entente powers that
is government would not accept
certain demands made by them
and that insistence on them would
disturb the relations between
Greece and the entente.
"It is reported from Athens."
says the news agency, that Pre
mier Shouloudis read before the
cabinet a collective note from the
entente powers. After a short
discussion the eabinet resolved
not to accept the demands made
in the note.
"In accordance with this de
cision the premier invited the en
tente ambassadors to meet him
and communicated to them the
following points decided upon by
the government:
"The Greek government is not
disposed to transfer to the enten
te administration of railroads in
northern Greece and Macedonia.
"The government does not con
sider it convenient to withdraw
Greek troops from Fiorina and
Kavala.
"The Greek government must
oppose military occupation by en
tente troops of the Corinth strait,
and at the same time advises tho
entente that such attempts would
disturb the present relations be
tween Greece and the entente.
Furthermore, Greece is op
posed to the establishment of
