' Fruit Tree Quacks,
Some so-called nursery j salesmen
operating in. - Missouri are making
promises that seem too good to be
true. The Missouri Agricultural" Ex
periment Station wishes to warn
farmers and fruit growers to be very
careful about investing in stook of an
unknown variety of supposed special
merit and against signing contracts to
buy and grow fruit trees, vines, or
other nursery stock on the strength
of promises that it can be sold later
At very high prices. - '
.Buyers should require the nnrsery
salesmen to show the special permits
which the law requires them to secure
from the Chief Inspector of Nurseries
and Orchards. Salesmen who cannot
show such permits should be reported
at once to the Experiment Station at
Columbia for investigation, but the
honesty of those who do have Buch
permits cannot be guaranteed by the
Experiment Station, altho there is a
atrong presumption that the men who
complied with the law by tftklrlg out
perpiits will be much more likely to
be honest and straightforward than
the man who is selling in violation of
the law. .. , . '
The exhibition 'such a permit
shova that the agent Is registered for
the saie and distribution of stock
which been inspected and found
free from dangerous insects and
diseases. There are plenty of - re
sponsible agents in the state repre
senting responsible nurseries and
orders can bo placed by mail with
nurs9rymen who will look after the
interests of their customers - honestly.
Bp with a little care the buyer can get
exactly what be wishes without deai
jn with questionable parties. . He
ebould order standard varieties which
lie knows are doing well In his locality
and refuse the fancy , varieties on
wbiah fabulous profits are promised.

Gasoline from Sliale. .
In view of the ever-increasing de
mand for gasoline and the increase in
price of crude oil, from which it is ob
tained, it Is Important tp know that
iu almost inexhaustible supply of oil
may be obtained from the shale of
northwestern Colorado, northeastern
Utah,-and southwestern' Wyoming.
This shale oontains materials which,
wUen heated, may be converted into
fliigf cost of distiling oil from suala
tas compared to the cost of producing
oil from wells has thus far prevented
the devevopment In this country of
such an Industry and may continue
' to prevent it for some time, but soon
er or later this great source of supply
will be utilized to supplement the de
creasing production from the regular
oil fields.
The oil derlvad from the shale Is
nimilur to that which is eiI.gjrodu6
ed from wells in the United State up
the rate of more than 250,000,000 bar
rels a year. When refined by ordin
ary methods the shale oil yields an
into tlies . JZ
A If
nice jw
ertf .&
Oil T Vii
- peace and makin's-peace message,
average of about 10 per cent gasoline,
35 per cent kerosene, and. a large
anapantvot, paraffin.. : The yield on
gasoline from the shale may probably
be largely increased by the use of re
fining methods especially designed
for that purpose. The gas, which is a
very good illuminating gas, will per
haps be sufficient to furnish all the heat
required to distill the crude oil from
the shale. .
The ammonia is a moBt valuable by
product of the distillation and may be
utilized in the manufacture of com
mercial fertilizer or other nitrogen
compounds, as the market demands.
The United States Geological Survey
bas examined large areas of the shale
in Colorado', Utah, and Wyoming and
has made distillation tests. Some beds
of shale that are several feet thick
will yield more than a barrel of oil to
the ton of shale, and one bed 6 inches
thick will yield more than two barrels
of crude oil to the ton of shale. One
ton of this shale should therefore yield
nearly ten gallons of gasoline by the
present commerial methods of gaso
line extraction, and larger yields may
be Made passible by new methods.
Little attention bag been paid to this
shale because the quantity of petro
leum produced from wells in the
United States has been sufficient to
satisfy all demands, but for more than
50 years the oil shale industry of
Scotland has been a very important
one.' In a recent year i&ore han ,000
men were employed in the industry in
in that country, yet the average yield
of oil per ton of shale was much less
than that which appears possible from
the shale of Colorado and Utah. It is
estimated that in Colorado alone, there
isiufflcient shale, In beds 8 feetor
more thick end richer than the shale
being mined in Scotland, to yield
twenty, billion barrels of crude oil,
from which at least two billion barrels
of gasoline may be extracted by or
dinary refining processes.
;' As was stated In the recent reply of
Secretary Lane to a Senate resolution
on the subject of gasoline: - "The
devetlongieht of this enormous reserve
simply awaits the fimn when the p'rice
of gasoline or the demand for Rfljer
distillation products warrants the
Utilization of this substitute source.
This'may happen In the future. At all
events these shales are likely to ba
drawn upon long before the exhaus
tion of the petroleum fields."
Should Study Plants Before Us
ing Spray.
' Spraying pays only when one knows
what a plant is being sprayed (or, and
when the right sort of spray is used,
according to. Prof. W H. Lawrence
of the horticultural department of the
University of Missouri at Columbia.
The only way to treat plants for a
fungus disease is to spray well before
the disease gei a g' py eaD"
stance that is strong enough to kill n
i nternal fungus will kill the plant also.
It is easy to see, therefore, that the
best remedy for fungus diseases is
preyntfpn. Tlita is obtained by
spraying tit plan$ with some good
material that will thoroughly coyer )t
On the reverie sld of this tidy
rod tin you will read: "Process
Patented July 30th, 1907," which
has made (Aree men smoke:
pipes where one smoked before I
and thus prevent the fungus from en
tering. . :
" Most inseoto may, be controlled by
spraying. There are two distinct
types of insects, those that chew their
food, and those that get their food by
sucking the sap. The control of the
first type of insects is best carried on
by spraying their food. Spray the
plant with some poison, which, when
taken into its stomach will kill the
insect.
It happens those insects which ob
tain their food by sucking the sap have
thin, soft bodies. The plant may be
rid of them by applying a spray that
will bum or dry them up. Thus it is
possible to control these insects with
out injuring the plants upon which
they feed. -
Water is the best carrying medium.
To this should be added the other
things that go to make up the spray
A perfect coating of the spray is de
sired in all cases, as it is best to supply
it under pressure. A pressure of 2Q9
to 250 pounds gives excellent results if
the outfit is in good condition.
Migratory Bird Law Continues
In Force.
Washington, i). C. March 18. A
misleading statement has recently be
come current in newspapers of the
Mississippi Valley and elsewhere, to
the effect that the Department of
Agriculture has suspended the en
forcement of the Federal regulations
under the Migratpry Bird Law apd by
tnis means bas enabled sportsiuep
under State laws, to shoot wild fowl
the, coming spring. -
Under the Federal regulations as
hey now stand, the season on all
migratory wild fowl is closed until
next autumn throughout the United
States. Federal inspectors and ward.
ens are required, and others interest-
ea in tne protection or wild fowl are
requested, to report to the Depart'
ment of Agriculture all cases of viola
tions of the regulations, in order that
proper, action may be taken.
The Department of Agriculture bas
no power to suspend the law or to
pardon violations of the regulations,
fcoubttog t'h? erroneous impression,
on which the newspaper 'stitteaments
are based has grown out qf the pend
ency of litigation involving the con
stitutionality of the Aot of Congress
approved March 4, 1013, under which
the regulations were promulgated.
The lower Federal courts disagreed as
to the validity of the statute and the
issue was carried to the Supreme
(Jgurt of the United States. The case
was argued in the Supreme Court la
October,' 191S, but has not been de
cided. Following the lower court
deolslons, Congress appropriated
money for the purpose of continuing
the enforcment of the law. ' The De
partment of Agriculture is bound to
r'ePP't' tQ typ pepartment pf Justice
violations of the regulations 'if the
Supreme Court should declare the law
constitutional. Ail persons should,
therefore, be warned of the danger
they incur from failure to abide by the
regulatiops, .
More Prosperity.
Eff eotive March ' 1st, the section
men- pf the M. B. & B. T. By. will get
a ten cent increase on the day and the
wages of the shop men have been re
adjusted so that nearly all of the men
of that department will get an increase
amounting to about 1 cent an hoar on
the day. The ten cent increase with
the section men bring their wages up
$1.60 a day. This is ten cents more
than most roads pay for this unskilled
labor, $1.60 being an average day's
pay for a seotion - hand. For some
reason unknown to the world section
men are about the poorest paid work
men of all laborers. On the M. B. &
B. T. By. there are about 100 men in
cluding extra gangs that will be af
fected by this raise of wages.
Something like this same number
will receive an increase in the shops.
Not all the men will get an increase.
There are a few, according to F. J.
Thomure, Qeneral Manager, who are
getting in the neighborhood of stand
ard machinist's pay that will not be
affected. In the adjustment to get
wages more equalized for the different
classes of labor some will get more
than a cent an hour increase while
others will get less, but making an
average of about one cent an hour.
