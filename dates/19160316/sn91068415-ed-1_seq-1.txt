F. N. Tate Tuesday returned from

President Harper of Elon College,
spoke before the High Point Train

most interesting discourse on "The
Four Square Sunday School."
We were pleased to see our old
friend E. V. Swaim in town ahis
week, but sorry to know that he is
not feeling well.
Two weeks before the Williard
Moran fight $75,000 worth of tickets
had been disposed of. March 25th
is the date and New York state the
location.
Jeff Jackson "colored, and John
Jones, white were" nabbed by the
officers Monday. ..They are wanted
at Troy. Jackson is charged with
false pretense and Jones gave a
worthless check but he made it good
and was given his liberty.
Editor Davis of the Silver Creek
(Neb.) Sand is a student of human
nature. He states in a iecent issue
that "a man who squeezes a dollar
never squeezes his wife," and opines
further that in looking over his sub

trict Attorney Hammer can get
Page's job in Congress if he will
make the run.

TO HELP OUR TOWN
A newspaper is in no sense a child
of charity. It earns twice over
every dollar it receives and it is
second to no enterprise in contribut
ing to the upbuilding of a com
munity. Its patrons reap iar muie
benefits from its pages than its pub
lishers, and in calling for the sup
port of the community in which it
is published, it asKs tor no more
than in all fairness belongs to u,
though generally it receives less.
Local Company Ready
Company M, High Point Riflles,
the best military company in the
state and standing third in the
National Guards, has through its
captain, Dallas Zollicofier, tendered
its services in case of need during
the Mexican trouble. It may be
that if the operations are prolonged
that companies in North Carolina
may be permitted to go to the bor
der line for training if nothing else.

Fake Wedding Suit
Mrs. K. O. Saunders who sued the
estate of the late W. W. Hinshaw
thru W. H. Ragan, administrator,
was awarded $422. in superior court
this week. Mrs. Saunders thought
she was legally married to Hinshaw
in 1914 but after his death found
he had a living wife and that her
marriage was a fake affair. The
woman said she loaned Hinshaw
mnnev and slaved for him to make
mnnev. The court evidently be
lieved part of her story in awarding
her the small sum of $422.

At a meeting of the city Council
Friday night the salary of Recorder
