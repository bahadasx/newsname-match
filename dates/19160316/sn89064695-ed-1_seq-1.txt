Chippewa Delegates In
dignant Over Daniels'
Interview.
Repudiate Statements Made Against
Senator Clapp.
(Concluded from last issue.)
With reference to Senator
Clapp's part in Chippewa legisla
tion, we know that he has worked
only for such measures on behalf
of the Chippewas of Minnesota
and of the WThite
Earth Reserva-
tion, as the Indians themselves
through their General Council and
their local councils on each reser
vation have asked.
It is well known that he has
been severely criticised by the
public press of Minnesota for hav
ing aided in securing the passage
of a bill known as the Clapp Act,
which placed the White Earth
Chippewas on an equality with the
whites, as free, independent citi
zens and for this, we sujbmit, that
he deserves the thanks of all alike.
This legislation, though bearing
the name of Senator Clapp, did
not originate with him, but with
the Indians, at whose request it
was passed. Moreover, it had the
consent and approval of the then
Commissioner of Indian Affairs
and the bill providing for the law
stion was first introduced in
by Congressman Steenerson.
leferring to the employment of
Webster Ballinger by the Chippe
was of Minnesota, which Mr. Dan
iels comments upon, this was done
in order to test the right of the
Interior Department to expend
last year the bum of $160,000.00,
which was used principally for the
payment from tribal funds of Gov
ernment employees and it is doubt
ful whether Senator Clapp or any
member of Congress knew any
thing about this employment. It
v^as a purely local matter and not
one in which \fr. Daniels had any
occasion to meddle. The reflec
tions cast upon it will add to the
conviction of the Chippewas, gen
erally, that he is not really in
sympathy with their interests or
their efforts to conserve tribal
funds.
The statement of Mr. Daniels
that there is a "white man^s coun
cil" among the Chippewa Indians
which authorized the employment
of an attorney in Minneapolis and
one in Washington is untrue. So
far as "re
know, the only contracts
that have been made by the In
dians with attorneys of late were
made under the authority of the
General Council of Minnesota
Chippewas, regularly and duly
held, pursuant to notice, according
to tribal custom. The particular
contract to which Mr. Daniels re
fers was authorized at a council
held in May. l'Jl. at which Chief
Supervisor E. P. Holcombe was
present under instructions issued
by the Secretary of the Interior.
The Indians had informed the Sec
retary of their purpose and had
requested the presence of a repre
sentative of the Department. The
contract made pursuant to that
Council authority provided for
compensation for two years only

to the attorneys at a moderate an
nual salary, with a contingent fee
of a snm equal to ten per cent
of any amount recovered from the
United States on account of in
volved treaty stipulations. There
is absolutely no basis for Mr. Dan
iels' statement that he "saved the
Indians at least half a million dol
lars." As a matter of fact, if he
was in any way responsible for the
non-approval of the Henderson
Wallace contract, which we do not
believe, he has caused the Chippe
was the loss in interest on their
claims of many times the amount
of any fees that the attorneys
might have earned.
To anyone who reflects, Mr.
Daniels' proposition must seem
absurd, for he would create the
impression that the present Demo
cratic Administration had com
bined with such prominent Re
publicans as Senator Clapp, E. E.
Smith and Simon Michelet to get
rid of C. C. Daniels.
As a matter of fact, Mr. Dan
iels is discrediting the Democratic
Administration under which he
held ofKce, and is sacrificing it, to
gether with the interests of In
dians and whites alike in Minneso
ta. We are reliably informed that
the investigations of the inspectors
disclosed this fact and that Mr.
Daniels was let out of the service.
It is our opinion that he made a
ridiculous failure during his tenure
of office, in a position for which he
was imported into Minnesota,
probably because he was the broth
er of thSecretary of the Navy,
and everything indicates that his
removal is for the good of the ser
vicesurely, we believe, it is for
the good of the Indians.

If the statements of Mr. Daniels
in regard to alleged frauds upon
the White Earth Reservation and
among the Minnesota Chippewas
generally, were correct, and it is
our opinion that he has largely
exaggerated them, surely he has
done little during his several years
of service to correct the wrong,
for he states in the Twin City
newspapers that 1400 suits were
started. Yet we are informed that
only 12 of these have actually been
tried, and of those tried, only 'A
decided in favor of his conten
tions.
We would like to call your at
tention to the fact that even these
were not fraud cases, but were
cases where Indians selling their
lands had made affidavits that they
were mixed-bloods, in order to
bring themselves within the scope
of the Clapp Act, and later after
having the benefit of the money,
had allowed the Government at
torneys to set up the claim that
they were full-bloods.
The Clapp Act, which Mr. Dan
iels claims was enacted to despoil
the full-bloods, gave the hitter no
right to alienate their allotments,
already actually
upon representa-
that they wore
mixed-bloods, the fraud was com
mitted, not ON the full-blood, but
v him.
Self-respecting Indians have no
sympathy with fraud, even if com
mined by so-called "ignoraut full
bloods.
The fact is that the Clapp Act
withdrew from the White Earth
Chippewas the curse of paternal
inm, formerly exercised by the
Federal Government over a class I

of Indians that Congress declared
capable of managing- their own
affairs, and wo. speak witn confi
dence when we say that the In
dians, generally, have a feeling of
thankfulnet-s only for those who
assisted in any way in bringing
about their individual freedom.
If Mr. Daniels had desired hon
estly to convey to the public a
correct expression through the
article published in your paper,
he would have said that the so
called full-blood delegates are en
tirely at liberty to come to Wash
ington, aud do regularly come to
Washington, and are given the
fullest consideration both by the
Departments and the Committees
of Congress.
He would further have stated
that no Indians on the White
Earth Reservation are starving,
who are willing and able to work,
and that rhe old people who are
unable to work are well taken care
of.
He would further say that the
motive back of his interview is
primarily to express his resent
ment at those who have assisted in
his too long delayed removal from
political office.
