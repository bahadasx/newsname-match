What Is Your Town To You?
Is not Your town what You make it ?
Are you afraid to stand for the best things when the
minority is for the worst things?
Is it not a weakling who will knuckle under when evil
conditions exist in your town?
Are we not too afraid of each other when it comes to
a show-down of existing evils?
Why should the better citizens tolerate lawlessness?
When is the best time to change these conditions ?
Do you object to the present ?
Whom do you expect to take the initiative to make
jour town better ?
Does your inactivity bespeak your judgment?
Squeeze The Land and not Your
Neighbor
We like to see a man saving. Pick up the chips,
be saving of axle-grease, keep out the rats and mice,
warm over the food that is left after a meal, patch a worn
garment, save.
And we like to see a man working. Get up early,
keep up the fences, repair the road, keep wood ahead,
keep down the weeds, make money.
Rut when dealing with a fellow man don't treat him
as hard as you do your land, getting everything out of
it you can. Don't brag when you cheat somebody.
We love a man who can get a living and not injure a
neighbor.

"The government of the United

of Senor Acuna and haa read with t
Isfactioa his suggestion for reciprocal
privileges to the American and Mexl-
respective territory lying along the
International boundary and who are a
constant menace te the lives and prop
erty of residents of that region.

which the recent raid on Columbus.
N. M., Is a deplorable example, and to
Insure peace and order In the regions
contiguous to the boundary between
the two repuollcs, readily grants per
mission for military forces of the da
facto government of Mexico to cross
the International boundary In pur
suit of lawless bands of armed men
who have entered Mexico from the
United Statea, committed outragea on
Mexican soil, and fled Into the United
States on the understanding that the
de facto government of Mexico grants
the reciprocal privileges that the mil
itary forces of the United States may
pursue acrosa the International boun
dary Into Mexican territory lawless
bands of armed men who hsve entered
the United States from Mexico,. com
mitted outrages on American soil and
fled Into Mexico.
"The government of the United
Statea understands that In view of its
agreement the reciprocal arrangement
proposed by the de facto government,
the arrangement Is now complete and
In foroe snd the reciprocal privileges
thereon may accordingly be exercised
by either government without further
Interchange of views.
"It Is a matter of gratification to
the government of the United States
that the de fafto government of Mex
ico haa evidenced so cordial and
friendly a spirit of co-operation in the
efforts of the authorities of the Uni
ted Statea to apprehend and punish
the hands of outlaws who seek refuse
bevond the Into-naMonnl boundary in
the hel'ef that the constituted author!
Ilea will resent any pursuit across the
boundary by the forces of the govern
ment whose citizens have suffered by
the crimes of the fugitives.
"With the same spirit of eordlsl
friendship the government of the Uni
ted Statea will exercise the privilege
granted by the de facto government
of Mexico In the hope and confident
exctation that by their mutual ef
forts lawlessneaa will be radicated and
peace and order maintained In the
territories of the United States and
Mexico contiguous to the internation
al boundary."
Following a conference with the
president In which the decision to
make the reply as above outlined was
reached, the secretary of state made
this announcement:
"In order to remove all apprehen
sion that may exist, either In the Uni
ted States or In Mexico, the president
haa authorized me to give In his name
the public assurance that the military
operations now In contemplation by
this government will be scrupulously
confined to the object already an
nininced, and that In no clrcumatauces
will they be suffered to trench In any
degree on the sovereignty of Mexico,
or develop into Intervention of any
kind In the Internal affaire of our sis
ter republic. On the contrary what Is
now being done Is deliberately Intend
ed to preclude the possibility of Inter

The sinking of the Norwegian
merchant ship giliua, with seven
Americans on board, off the coast of
France is arousing interest In the
United States. The vessel waa
bound for Havre with a cargo of
wheat and is thought to have been
struck by a torpedo without wani

occurred involving American citi
zens since the German ruling on tba

The daring act of the Mexican
revolutionist Villa in crossing the
American border, with a band of his
followers, and killing eighteen
American citizens at Columbus, New
Mexico, has aroused the government.
Orders have been given to send a de
tachment of United States regulars
across the bonier to pursue and cap
ture Villa. This is not an act of war
or even of interference in the af
fairs of Mexico, according to inter
national law, but it might easily
lead to a long continued stay on
Mexican soil and to other complica
tions. Congress almost unanimous
ly endorses the President's act.
A law has been presented in the
Japanese legislative body during the

the right of Japanese children, born

Japan always retained a claim on
these children, thus giving them a
kind of double nationality. The
United States has objected to this
and it has been one of the causes of
opposition to emigrants from Japan.
