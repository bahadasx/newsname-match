Few Men in Public Life Whose

IXDIANAl'üUS, March 16. Few
men In public life, In state or nation,
have ever been more universally
recognized as possessing all those
excellent and sterling qualities
which make men great, than had
been Sen. Benjamin Franklin Shive

pressed by republicans ami demo
crats alike, both by individuals and
in the part j' press, at the loss sus
tained by Indiana and In the senate
of the Fnited States through hit;
death. First becoming conspicuous
In politics when he turned his solid
republican district to-a democratic
majority, he served three terms in
the congress, for two terms being
the youngest member of that body,
and he had all his life since been a
leader in the paity counnels.
While Clov. llalston wired to Sen.
Kern suggesting the idea of having
the body lie In state in the capitol
building. Mrs. Shively believed she
would be following what the senator
would himself have wished when she
decided against the plan. State of

dianapolis will go to South IJend by
special cars to attend the funeral
Saturday afternoon.

The comments from Indianapolis
newspapers none of which is demo
cratic in politics, are especially in
teresting to the people of Indiana.
The Indianapolis Times, independ
ent, says:
"Brilliant, yet solid and convinc
ing in oratory; ready in the pre
sentment of argument and fact;
studious and thoughtful in the handl
ing of issues; courtly and of fine
appearance and commanding figure.
Sen. Benjamin F. Shively of Indiana
lost no time in gaining a forward
place in the upper house and to the
time of his death maintained import
ant leadership and unusual influence.
"By reason of Ids distinguished
serviie as a representative In the
tiMh, 5('th. 51st and 5 2nd congresses,
Shively was able as a senator, be
ginning his greater service in 1101.
to offer to his colleagues the fruits
of valuable experience. He knew
the ropes thoroughly and his recog
nized ability, combined with exper
ience, marked him for responsibility.
"With the coming of a democratic
initional administration the industry
and capabilities of Sen. Shively
came into immediate use on behalf
of Pies't Wilson's policies. Because
of trouble in Mexico and the break
ing out of war abroad, with all the
tangles and troubles of International
cataclysm and upheaval. Shively at
once became a source of strength
and sanity, serving on the import

relations with conspicuous credit to
himself and to his state.

"It was Shively's destiny to bo
entrusted with great and weighty
tasks while at the same time he was
confronted, by the sufferings incident
to the dread disease which finally
caused his death. His gallant
struggle against the inevitable: his
heroic disregard for pain, and his
brave effort to continue public ser
vice in spite of weakness and fatal
illness are known to the frinda who
have been Iiis close associates at
Washington.
"Sen. Shively's record as a senator
will stand the tests of time. His
physical condition in recent years
made it impossible for him to get
into the partisan fray and the clash
of debate as was his earlier wont,
but his position was usually taken
on the side of justice, and his sen
ate record will bear the most critical
scrutiny. In short, he was a good
servant. No better tribute is to be

The Indianapolis News, republican

"The death of Sen. Shively will be
deplored by the people of Indiana,
whom he had served faithfully and

FL PASO, Texas, March DJ. The
Madera Co.. limited, owner of more
than $1,000,000 worth of sawmills
and lumber in the Galeana district,
southwest of Casas Grandes, is to be
the next victim of the Villa bandits,
according to a dispatch received in
El Paso today.
Villa and his men were said to bo
moving in the dircctioti of Pearson,
feat of the company's offices, and
main plant, after his departure from
Corralitos. He apparently took a
roundabout route to avoid the Car
ranza troops at Casus Grandes.
There is little loot to be had at
Pearson, since most of the popula
tion is engaged in work at the mills,
but it is believed that loot is the
secondary consideration in Villa's
mind. His grievarce against the
company dates back to Dec. 12 0.
when he was informed by employes
of the company at Madera that they
had 3,000 pesos coming to them
which they could not collect. Villa
went to the head of the company
but got no satisfaction. Then he
arrested '0 American employes of
the company, taking them to Chi
li Juhuu City, where they were held
for ransom. In the meantime, how
ever, Carranzista troops advanced
upon Chihuahua City and Villa and
his men were forced to JW. The
captives were released anil the ran

ment was made, the unofficial re
ports attributing the navy chiefs de
parture from the admiralty to the
inactivity of the fleet.
It is believed that the submarine
policy cf the government will stand.
Admiral von Tirpitz has been ac
cused by his enemies of being the
father of the "policy of frightful
ness." He was the originator of the
submarine blockade, but is under
stood to have consistently opposed
the departure of the German high
fleet from the Kiel canal.
It was reported in some quarters
that Admiral von Tirpitz had been
compelled to resign by the kaiser In
order to avoid dismissal, but this was
contrary to the information convey
ed in the official announcement.
ItcHifiiiatioii a Thuiulerlxdt.
The resignation of the minister of
marine was a thunderbolt to Ger
many, and many regarded it as a
national misfortune.
According to press reports the ad
miral I 111 from overwork and
anxiety, and this has been aggra
vated by disappointment. Plans
which Admiral von Tirpitz had
worked out failed of carriage, al
though this was no fault of the head
of the navy. However, it increased
the worries of the admiral.
The Iralser, it is said, accepted tho
admiral's resignation with reluct
ance, and la expected to create him
a count in recognition of his ser
vices. It is certain that decorations
and probably a pension will be con
ferred upon the retiring officer.
There- are some who believe that
the departure of Admiral von Tirpitz
marks a change in the naval policy
of Germany and that the high seaa
seas fleet will now come forth to
give battle to the British fleet.
The Overseas News agency in com
menting upon the resignation of Ad
miral von Tirpitz says:
"In some quarters the belief exists
that the resignation was connected
with the emperor's decision not to
extend the submarine vvarfare be
yond the limits announced in the
memorandum to neutrals and not to
direct against neutral ships.
"As regards the conduct of the
submarine warfare, the mere change
of persons at the head of the ad
miralty is not of importance."

in Mexican Situation.
International News Servle:
WASHINGTON, March 16. Fully
convinced that the crisis in the
Meyican situation ha-s been passed
for the present, the administration
today settled down to await action.
With the American troops pushing
forward to the south in their hunt
for VUla without havintc encoun
tered any opposition from the con
stitutionalist forces, officials believe
that the real danger ha passed.
There will be isolated clashes with
former Villlstsa troops impressed
into the Carranza army without con
sent, and with Mexican guerillas,
but both at the state and the war
departments the officials today said
that the Carranza government has
stood the test and has demonstrated
that Obregon still dominates the
army. He has decreed that there
shall be no conflict with the Amer
ican expedition and his subordinate
olflcers are obeying his command.
At the war department today It
was stated that all of the informa
tion so far received from the border
simply bears out the announcements
Gen. Kredeiick Funston already has
made to the press from his head
quarters in San Antonio. No in
formation as to how far into Mex
ico the advance guard of the expedi
tion has reached was mad public.
It was explained, however, that at
th outset there uas no Intention of
attempting a speed record Inasmuch
as it will be necessary to establish
the reserve depot, the advanced baso
and to provide the necessary in
fantry forces to guard the lines of

With the situation seemingly clear

when the first serious clash would
take place. They see little hope of
the American forces getting into

bandit leaders who are strong In 1
