RANDM REWLLECTIONS
OF FAIRFIELD COUNIY
(BY W. J. ELLIOTT.)
THE OLD WELL IN THE STREET
Near ing' ol'd hom' furnished
water to many of Wheeler's cav
alry and Sherman's men also,
and after the war as the famish
ed soldiers were returning to
their homes in Georgia, Alabama
and the Gulf states it was a rest
ing place for many of them.
When I would see these soldiers
coming I would get my father's
stone pitcher for them to drink
from, knowing that I would soon
ask them questions to get them
started on their war experience.
Very often~ they would sit for
hours in- the old split bottom
chairs after they were settled
down comfortably. Some would
exhibit their wounds 'to me, tell
me where they were when they
received the wound and how they
fared in prison or on the battle
field. I felt very much disap
Mointed at the surrender of the
southern troops and would say
to the soldiers that I would have
fought on had I been them. But
I usually got the same reply in
substance, that they had enough
of it and were glad to get home.
They explained how they were
often left on the battle field for
hours in a wounded condition,
weak and exhausted. Then per
haps to linger in a Yankee hos
pital without proper food- and
careful medical attention. I re
member one old fellow was com
plaining of having to eat bread
without lard or salt in it. He
was cutting thin slices from a
biscuit of this kind which looked
like white hoan to me and re
marked, how would you like to
be fed on this kind of bread? I
told. him I did not know and ask
ed him to let -me taste it. . His
reply was no, I have 'not enough
for myself, nor did he let me
taste it. As tey were about to
leave I would get a pitcher of
water to fill heir canteens.and it
de salways~ withrsregraet tigt I
saw them depart for I enjoyed
th.e-, to 1e ,4_
I well remember the amusing
appearance of some of- the ve
hiles,which came to Winnsboro
aftertrans raid. - The Yan
iees would soie times destroy
the body of a tne carriage and
leave the running gear. The
coupling poles of some.of these
vehicles were cured, so we can
imagine how.a wagon body con
structed of rough boards would
appear on the running gear of a
$600 carriaged'he team would
also often ,afford amusement as
a large mule and a small ox were
in some cases hitched side by side
to such an outfit Sometimes
the wheels were of different
makeup, the box in the hub being'
in some instances so much larger
than the spindle that the wheel
would have a drun~ken motion.
Bt the people had to use impro
vised arrangements of all kinds.
We had lamps in whch we used
a liquid called Camphene. We
called them by their name -Cam
phene lamps. I dont know what
the stuff was made of. But the
kerosene lamp soon made its ap
pearance and many of our citi
zens were afraid of this kind of
light Capt Jordan was not
much in favor of them. He came
home one morning and said to
me, well Kinney they have the
laugh on me. On being asked by
my father what was the joke he
replied oh I set the bed curtain
afire with a candle last night.
Tallow car ses were supplanted
by what we called spern candles.
It was a common occurrence to
keep broom paper about to clean
the candle grease from our cloth
ing by prossmng the paper with
a hot iron to absorb the grease.
Sherman's army destroyed the
rail road from old Youngsville,
near the present location of
Woodward station to Hopkins be
low Columbia, the entire distance
being about ;sixty'- miles. A
great many of our people secured
teams and hauled cotton to Hop
kins for shipment to Charleston.
This little station wv a s a
busy hustling place until the road
was rebuilt, for it was the then
terminus of the line to Charles
leston. There was considerable
hauling done between Winnsboro
and Augusta also. Capit. Thos.
Jordan, Mr.~ McElroy, Thos. K.
Anderson, Win. D. Aiken, a
Saniard by the name of John
Cardera and my father all had
teams hauling to various points
before the rail road was com
pleted. The line to Augusta,
however, was built after the war.
I well remember the men with
the teams would speak of "Pine
House" as a stopping place. It
was located near Trenton, in
efedM county, nd for a while
there was such a station as Pi
House. Later the trains stopp
at Trenton and Pine House.

accident to the foreman of the

Paper Hard to Get
3tate 14th.
Printers in Columbia are ad.
vised by manufacturers that un
less the scarcity of raw material
Eor paper making is relieved
shortly some of the mills must be
:losed. Arthur C. Hastings,
president of the American Writ
ng Paper company, Holyoke,
WIass., writes:
"The country is facing the
greatest general paper famine in
its history. The stocks in theI
bands of our jobbers are very
low, our imports have been prac
tically cut off, and our exports
are greater than ever before.
What is more, I can see no relief
in sight. I do not know how we
are going to meet the situation."
An appeal made to women in
1.801 by New England paper man
ifacturers to save their rags is
recalled by the federal depart-I
ment of commerce. In a circular
issued Friday, urging every one
to hoard both paper and rags to
avert a threatened shortage of
paper making materials. It is
declared the need is as urgent
now as then. A great part of
the paper thrown away every day
should be used over again, the
circular declares. The paper say
ing crusade was suggested by pa
per manufacturers.
