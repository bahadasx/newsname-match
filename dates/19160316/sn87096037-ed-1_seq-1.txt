Land Owners, AttentionJ
We desire to explain to you several reasons why we can
sell land and at the same time show you the tree benefits that
you receive by listing land with this company. There are no
secrets, the facts are plain.
Reason No. 1. Every man connected with this Company
has
had several years of experience aiCd has been successful
in selling land.
No. 2. This company is reliable and we aim to make
our word, as well as our note, absolutely good, and. are glad
to furnish bank references.
No. 3. We have been careful and have spared no ex
pense in perfecting a strong organization to bring buyers to
this part of North Dakota. We will have from 300 to 500
agents located in Iowa, Illinois, Nebraska, South Dakota,
Minnesota and Wiseonsin, and everyone of these men have
a direct contract with this Company to giue their time and
attention to this work.
No. 4. In order to induce buyers to come to North Da
kota, we pay part of their railroad fare, whether they buy or
not, and also pay the agent's tare who accompanies them.
No. 5. We will have plenty of cars to show land.
No. 6. When we find a man who has to sell his Iowa or
Illinois farm before he bugs up here, we don't have to wait
tor him to sell it but will trade with him.
Surely, you can see in the above six reasons what a
splendid opportunity you have to sell by listing with us. Just
think of all of this service you are getting that don't cost you
one cent. We have to pay the bills, take all the chances, and
you stand no chance to loose.

At a recent convention when Lu verne
was a veritable mecca for Datnes,
gathered here from over tha state, a
very novel contest after the manner of
those held in the Old Country was
conducted. The contestants were,
mounted on horses. There were fifteen
in number all which paid nominal en
trance fee3 to pay for the prizes of the
winners. A cross bar was plaoed
horizontally over two poles approx
imately fifteen feet high and
tweDty
feet apart. From this bar there were
suspended small iron ringsadout three
inches in diameter. The object was
for the riders to advance at a gal
loping speed, thrust a small stick
through the ring, disconect it, and
id is re or a a a
gone through ten times by eaoh con
testant. This is a very difficult feat
and some meet with dismisal failure.
The winner, Martin Jensen, suceeded
in making the "stab" six times out of
the ten. He received an elegant prize
and a ticket for the Dan ishdanca given
evening. The second prize was won
by C. Hansen. It is said this contest
is an ancient custom in Denmark.
