REAL BATTLE WITH VILLA NEAR
PETTIT
<3 Of the 20 candidates for city commission
er whose names will go on the primary bal
lot F. H. Pettit stands as one who certainly
should he elected.
lie is the biggest calihred man in the race.
•I He is a first-class business man; Tacoma
knows him as such.
He believes our government is costing us
too much, and he has tome concrete plans I'or
helping make it cost less.
He doesn't talk vaguely about ''economy
antl efficiency" and leave you to guess liow
he is going to attain them; he tells just how
he plana to go about economizing and efti
ciency-inducing. We will go into consider
able detail in later articles on his plans in
this regard.
I He has a sincere, high minded ideal of
public service. He will instill the police de
partment with the policy of constructive,
preventive, upbuilding work, rather than
the mere arresting of law-violaters, real and
alleged.
I He is clean. Nobody who lived in Tacoma
during the part of a term he served as pub
lic safety commissioner could doubt that.
Yet he is no fanatic. His practical expe
rience as heiid of the police department
would have shown him tlie mistake of nar
row-mindedness, if he had needed showing.
In a formal staleinent he remarks: "I do
not expect to indulge in any grandstand or
fanatical schemes of regeneration, but 1 do
expect to take a firm, consistent and contin
uous stand for a better, cleaner, more sober
ami more prosperous Tacoina."
If that hasn't the ring of good sense, we
don't know good sense when we we see it.

DEEP HATE BACKS
MEXICAN BULLETS
1»V I -MOP. FREDERICK STARR
I'l'ofcssoi' of Anthropology in
University of Chicago.
(lVof. Frederick Starr, the
noted anthropologist, knows Mex
ico better than any other Ameri
can. In pur .ill of lib studies
he mude 22 visits to that country.
Anti-Americanism is a reality
• in Mexico! We Americans :ire
hated as a people, we are hated as
a nation.
WHY do the Mexicans hate us?
Primarily and fundamentally
BECAUSE they are Spanish-In
dian, while we are Anglo-Saxon.
WE DESPISE THE MEXI
, CANB, because they differ from
us; THEY HATE US because we
THAT
SOMETHING
There Is something
about nature that ap
peals to us all. Spring
inspires new things, and
tlie coming of tlie sea
son opens up new ambi
tions. There is no ques
tion about prosperity
being here. All should
dress up this week and
show the right spirit.
Incidentally, call at this
Hank with your deposits.

The Tacoma Times
differ from them.
We have sent them luiantities
of adventurers who have gone
there to "show them how to do
! things."
But In a thousand ways Ameii-
I can methods of huslness are Ill
adapted to Mexican surroundings,
and the attempt to force them
upon the country Is pure folly.
The Mexicans hate us hecause
we have deprived them of terri
tory. The loss of Texas was a se
rious hlow, and they have always
ascrlhed it to us. We took from
them more than HALF their ter
ritory as a result of the unjust
war of 1947.
As a fact, we wanted land—
and we TOOK it! Mexico has
not forgotten—she will not for
get—that act.
But undoubtedly the chief rea
son why the Mexicans today hate
us so heartily is that THEY
FEEL WE ARE EXPLOITING
THEM AND THEIR COUNTRY.
Everywhere they find Ameri
can capital owning their sources
of wealth. Blindly, they feel that
they have been defrauded.
It has been so easy for such
Americans as William Randolph
Hearst, Harrison Gray Otis, E.
H. Harrlman, the Rockefellers,
the Guggenheims and others,
each to have obtained possession
of millions of Mexican acres."
The Mexicans know they have
been robbed. But they also know
that we Americans will fight If
need be for our so-called "rights."
So they feel the helplessness of
It all, and in that helplessness
their hatred takes "deeper "and
deeper root!

—Three hours after a ter

Royal Dutch Lloyd liner Tu
bantia Hank in the North Sea,
it ((as reported today.
She carried'ii7 passengers and
a crew of ;!00. All were reported
to have been saved.
The company's offices said the
Tubantia probably hit a mine,
though the captain thought per
haps she had been torpedoed.
The explosion occurred at mid
night, 12 hours after the liner
sailed from Amsterdam A huge
hole was ripped in her stern.
Wireless calls for help were im- j
mediately flashed. Passengers
and crew abandoned the vessel,
Only tlie fact that the Tu
bantia was near land is lie-
lleved to have prevented cas
ualties. It is possible a few
sailors perished.
Two life boats reached tlie
lightship at 1 1 this morning.
Dutch torpedo boats picked up
others.
The Tubantia is a vessel of
14,00(1 tons, engaged in the South
American service.

WAR IN
MEXICO
NO JOKE
] NEW YORK. March 16.—What
will tlie American soldiers 1)0 "P
against in fight
ing Villa and his
bands of guerilla
fighters?
No man Is so
qualified to set
it forth so accu
rately and vivid
ly as John Reed;
the famous war
correspond c nt
who accompa
nied Villa and
JOHN REED, his army for a
year in Mexico.
Here is what he has to say
about our dash across the bor
der:
"We Americans are inclined to
consider greasers' as treacherous
cowards. In that we make a mis
take.
"The Mexicans have a sort of
courage that Anglo-Saxons do not
know—a Latin courage that leads
them to throw themselves in the
face of forlorn hopes.
"I have seen barefooted I
peons walk up the street to
the wall of a corral sur
mounted by five machine
guns pumping forth a steady
stream of bullets, and those
peons were unarmed cm ept
I'or sticks of dynamite sewed
up in cowsklns which they
threw by hand over the cor.
i d wall.
"Four times they did this
until they had succeeded In
blowing the defenders to
pieces.
"For us fighting in Mexico is
largely a question of opposing
guerilla fighters, ineffective in
Hie field, but extremely annoying
to an army.
"The existence of small posts,
would life endangered by mobile
forces of mounted peons, all good
shots, able to move quickly,
knowing the country Intimately
and capable of eluding pursit In
trackless mountains.
"It Is to be no Joke, tills raid
Into Mexico. It means the hard
est possible kind of warfare!"
CALL OFT MILITIA

Municipal officials in Arizona

tic appeals lo Gen. Funston for

"It is just as impossible to

C'apt. Read.
"The police have no way to ob
