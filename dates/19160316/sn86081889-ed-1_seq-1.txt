was taken to the Chambersburg

Henry Ilann sawed a yellow
pine tree on the Meadow-Billy
Patterson farm, in Ayr township,
now owned by Mrs. D. A. Nelson,
that made 2.C00 feet of boards.
The tree made five 16-ft. logs,
two, S ft., and one 10-ft. It
measured 3G inches across the
stump, and S2 fo'.t up from th?
stump, inches. Here's a
chance for some of our lumber
men to beat this. They are cut
ting the timber off about ten
acres of this tract and expect a
yield of 200,000 feet. The timber

The family of George McEl

Grissinger occupy a double house
00 West Walnut street. Tuesday
morning Mrs. McEidowney de
tected the odor of smoke that in
dicated smouldering fire, and it
se.cir.ed to come from the side of
the house occupied by Mrs. Gris
singer. The Grissinger family
had gone away from the house a
short time before this, the daugh
ter, Miss Lucille, being at school.
Word was sent to Lucille, who
came home, went into the house
and found that a dress that had
been hanging near where the
stovepipe came through the sec
ond floor, had fallen" against the
pfpe, had ignited, and set fire to
the floor around the pipe and was
burning the o cloth around the
pipe hole. The fire was, quickly
extinguished," and lucky it was
that it was discovered early.

When Adam first fell into the
wate r the human race took a step
forward. Civilization and bath
tubs now go hand in hand.
Authorities may vary in dis
cusnng the m?rit3 cf the hot
oath, the fryA bath and the cold
bath, but ti.ey all agree in the
abstract tl.r.tlathinj? is a neces
sity to good ht.'.lth and a prime
promoter of self respjet. The
removal from the skin of the ac
cumulation of refuse matter is
the primary reason for the bath.
It is essential to good health
that the sicin be kept in proper
condition, as it automatically reg
ulates the heat of the body, per
mitting it to cool off when it be
comes too warm, and keeping in
heat when it becomes too coid.
It assists the lungs and kidneys
in the disposal of refuse matter.
When the skin sweat3 it assists
the kidneys. When not too
heavily clothed it respires and
helps the lungs.
A bath should not be taken too
near meal time. There is a norm
al attraction of the blood toward
the stomach after eating; any
interference with this and the at
traction of the blood toward the
surface of the body is apt to ar
rest digestion.
Warm baths have a soothing
effect and are often prescribed
for nervousness. The tepid bath
can do no harm. Cold baths are
stimulating but are apt to be in
jurious if the. heart action is not
strong enough to permit of a
ready reaction. To some individ
uals the shock to the nervous
systom is so great that they can
not accustom themselves to cold
baths.
Mr. and Mrs. R. C. McCandlish
and Mrs. W. F. Sappington, of
Hancock, motored to McConnells
burg last Saturday evening and
spent the tijne until Monday

Austin Carbaugh, formerly cf

Prune the Crapes at Coce.
Grape3 vines should be pruned
at once. Do not wait until the
weather lias begun to warm up
and the growth takes place, then
the vines bleed and are weakened
by the pruning.
Most grape vine are not
pruned severely enough. By
careiul observation the grape
gnnvors in the Chautauqua grape
belt have found that to produce
an annual average crop of the
fii-st class fruit, a Concord vine
should be pruned back to twenty
five buds. Iowa, Worden and
Moore's Early Delaware require
shorter budding, eighteen or
twenty buds being sufficient.
Lady, Eclipse, Brighton, Brilliant,
Green Net and Niagara require
moderately long pruning, about
twenty-five bud, while Jeffer
son, Herbert, and Vergennes re
quired somewhat longer pruning
of about thirty buds.
Where more buds are left than
nece::sary, more wood growth i-i
made and it does not ripen prop
erly, so that the crop for the surv
ceemng year is shortened. Bull
etin No. 217 of the tltaUi Depart
ment of Agriculture discusses
thoroughly grape culture in Penn
sylvania. It can be na-J upon re
quest to the department at Har
