a wireless message, has been received
there stating that the large Dutch
passenger steamship Tubantia out

river Plata, has been torpedoed and
is in a sinking condition near the
Noordhinder lightship. All the

The London agents of the steamship
Tubantia which is owned by the Holland-Lloyd

struck a mine and is sinking. An
other dispatch says the Tubantia was
torpedoed. The steamship, which is
of 15,000 tons gross, left Amsterdam
yesterday for Buenos Aires with pas
sengers and a cargo. She was to
have stopped at Falmouth and the
peninsular ports, where the majority
of the passengers were to have been
taken aboard.
A life saving boat has left the Hook
of Holland to search for the sinking
vessel and Dutch torpedo boats are
hurrying to the rescue of the ships
passengers in the lifeboats.
The Tubantia was built at Glasgow
in 1913 and is 540 feet long and 65
feet beam. She left Buenos Aires on
February 4 for Amsterdam and was
reported as having passed Fernado
Noronha on February 14.
Americans on Board,
"It is now certain that Tubantia was
torpedoed without warning," tele
graphs the Amsterdam correspondent
of the Central News.
"There were three Americans on
board. They were Richard Schilling,
an American consul: Kmma Schilling
and Carmen Schilling."
The wireless messages which was
signed "First Wireless Operator," was
received last night at Yumiden by

"Tubantia torpedoed and lost. Am
now leaving ship with captain. Don't

be employed by the Dominion govern
ment for internal uses. The new
bonds, it Is understood, will bear in
terest at five per cent. Dispatches re

New York. March 16. The French
steamer Patria, of the Fabre line,
carrying among her passengers 2i
Americans including an American con
sul, was attacked without warning by
a submarine off the Algerian coast on
March 1, Captain Pierre Deschelles
announced today upon the arrival of
the ship from Mediterranean ports. A
torpedo missed the ship by about
thirty feet.
OIney Arnold, American consul
general at Cairo, was a passenger on
the ship from Naples to Lisbon. He
told Captain Deschelles that he would
forward a full report of the attack to
the United States government. It was
news, however, to Captain Deschelles
that cable dispatches have since re
ported that Mr. Arnold, who was re
turning home, died at Lisbon, the day
after his arrival there. Information
received by the state department was
that he was on the verge of a nervous
breakdown at the time of his depart
ure from Cairo.
Received Warning Message.
The night before the submarine ap
peared Captain Deschelles received
this warning:
"Be careful. Submarine sighted
about 100 miles from Cape De Guarde.
By wireless from Algiers."
He remained on the bridge all night
and posted fifteen lookouts around the
ship. The captain said he did not per
sonally see the submarine or the tor
pedo, but both were seen by his first
officer and a number of passengers
The ship was making full speed at the
time. Orders were immediately given
to steer a zig-zag course and no fur
ther trace of the submersible was
seen.
"I regret to say I did not have any
guns." Captain Deschelles said, and
added that he would make a request
that his ship be equipped wit h guns
when he returns to France. None of
the American passengers saw the sub
marine. The Americans in the first
cabin included Robert Norman of Bal
timore. He said there was very lit
tle panic at the time.
Passengers who saw the torpedo
caused a turmoil which attracted the
steerage passengers to the rails and
the excitement subsided only after the
periscope disappeared and the sh i p
sped away.
The Pntria after landing at other
ports carried nearly 2,000 passengers
when she arrived here today. When
the submarine attack was made there
were Sfi passengers on hoard.
Captain Deschelles said he had al
ready sent a full report of the incident
to the French government.

the successful working of the censor

er it was decided to catch and pun

to the attitude of Carranza and his
followers.
When General Pershing wired yes
terday that he had crossed the border
and had been joined by the Carranza
force stationed at Palomas, the major
general evinced great satisfaction.
This was heightened this morning
when early reports indicated the only
violence along the entire border oc

Martin was not inclined to play his
