It U Said That Object of Meat
ure it to Get Rid of Preent
Trustee.
For some weeks past it has been
rumored that the Bilbo administia
tion would seek to get rid of tka
parent board of trustees havir.t; su
pervision over the University of
Mississippi, at Oxford, the A. and M.
College, at Starkville, and the Indus
trial Institute and College in this
city, by the passage of a measure
providing for the abolition of this
body and for the creation of separ
ate governmental boards for each
institution, and a bill with this end
in view was introduced in the House
at Jackson Monday.
It is said that the real object of
the legislation recently undertaken
is to oust Hon. G. R. Hightower from
the presidency of the A. and M.
College. During his gubernatorial
campaign Governor Bilbo publicly
asserted that if elected he would
"Kick Hightower out," and it is
known that soon after his induction
into office he wrote letters to the
present trustees requesting them
to hand in their resignations. Had
this request been complied with it
would have then been incumbent
upon the governor to fill their places,
and he would have appointed men in
sympathy with his policy who would
have carried out his plans. The pres
ent trustees, however, refused to re
sign, and the next step of the govern
or was to put in operation a scheme
to legislate them out of office.
Thera was in circulation at one
Bilbo also sought the scalp of Hon.
H. L. Whitfield, president of the In
dustrial Institute and College in this
city, and a Jackson paper went so
far as to state that the place had
been offered to Hon. A. A. Kincan
non, who was formerly the executive
head of the institution and is now
superintendent of public schools in
Memphis; but when interviewed on
the subject by a reporter for a
Memphis daily, Dr. Kincannon said
there was nothing in the rumor and
that he had no intention of leaving
the Bluff City. Bilbo has never
evinced any open antagonism against
President Whitfield, and it is not be
lieved that any effort will be made
to oust him from the presidency of
the college.
The bill providing for the aboli
tion of the present board of trustees
and for the creation of separate
boards for each of the state's three
.leading educational institutions was
referred to the committee on univer
sities and colleges.
Mr, Lee Myers, a former Colum
bian, who is now assistant post mas
ter at West Point, spent the first of
the week here, having come to the
city to stand the civil service exam
ination for postoffice inspector.

COMMITTEE ADOPTS THIS
PLAN OF DENOTING
CHOICE FOR NOMINEE.
THURSDAY, MAY 18,
IS DATE SELECTED
Majority of Member Believe
That Wilson will be Unop
posed at Convention.
Jackson, Miss., March 15. Pur
suant to a call sent out by Chairman
M. McBeath, the state Democratic
executive committee of Mississippi
met here Tuesday and decided in
stead of holding a Democratic pres
idential primary, to call a state con
vention. The convention plan having j
been adopted the next matter was
to decide upon the time for holding;
same, and May 18 was designated.
There was a sharp conflict over the
question whether a primary or a
convention should be held, a resolu
tion for primary being introduced
by Attorney-General Collins, hold
ing a proxy for J. L. Latham. E. A.
Fitzgerald of the Eighth District in
troduced the substitute declaring' for
a state convention, which was adopt
ed after a brief discussion.
Another resolution calls for coun
ties to hold their conventions on
May 13, and these county conven
tions will select delegates to the
state convention.
The meeting was presided over by
Chairman McBeath, (member from
the Fifth District, with J. E. Nor
wood, of Magnolia, Seventh District
delegate, as secretary.
Others present were: J. F. Barrow,
proxy of S. W. Mullins, of the Sec
ond District; Mima Williams of the
Sixth District; Ed. A. Fitzgerald, of
Eighth District; W. F. Gray," proxy
for F. M. Stowers of the Second
District; Dr. J. P. Taylor, proxy for
J. Yi'-. Ilyihu.., v V;.o i'A.iiii Dis
trict; C. E. Connor, proxy for W.
M. Connor, of the Sixth District; J.
L. Seuwright of the Fourth District;
W. H. Joiner, of the Fifth District;
J. W. T. Boggan, of the First Dis
trict; Walter Sillos, Jr., of Third
District; Dr. R. M. Butler, Seventh
District; S. D. Hewes, Eighth Dis
trict; H. H. Casteel, proxy for
Hamp Woods of the Second District;
J. F. Frierson, proxy for S. B. John
son, of the First District, and J. L.
Haley, Third District.
The committee meeting was held
in Representatives Hall at 1 o'clock
Tuesday afternoon, Chairman Mc
Beath, stating the object, which was
to provide a way of selecting dele
gates to the National Democratic
Convention at St. Louis. The Ross
Collins resolution for a set of pri
maries was first sent up and read,
and directly afterwards that of
Committeeman Fitzgerald. It was ap
parent that the attorney-general was
in a minority, the majority holding
the view that as Woodrow Wilson is
likely to be unopposed in the nation
al convention, it would be unneces
sary to impose the expense of hold
ing primaries.
After providing for the conven
tion the committee adjourned, sub
ject to call of Chairman McBeath.

CHILDREN ASK PERMISSi
TO SKATE ON SIDEWALKS
ADOLESCENTS SEND NAIVE
NOTE TO MA, YOR GUNTER
REGARDING MATTER.
Some enthusiastic adolescent
skaters feel hurt necause the mu
nicipal authorities have issued an
edict prohibiting them from using
the sidewalks of the city for skating
purposes, and have written a note
to Mavor Gunter requesting him to
instruct the police not to enforce
the ordinance.
While the Commercial 'gladly pub
lishes the note, which is couched in
the naive and unaffected language
of childhood, we nevertheless wish
to express a few words of warning
on the subject. The children are not
to blame for requesting permission
to skate on the sidewalks, as the
seeking of pleasure is characteristic
of the untutored and undeveloped
mind. Psycchologists and crimnolo-
gists tell us, however, that if the
boy and girl of fifteen were as ma
ture in judgment as the man and
woman of forty there would be few
criminals and derelicts, and that our
jails and insane asylums would stand
practically empty. It is therefore in
cumbent upon parents to expluin to
their children the danger which they i
encounter in skating upon sidewalks'
and to dissuade them from indulging
in this pastime.
