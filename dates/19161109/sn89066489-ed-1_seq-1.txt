KANSAS TO WILSON B7
20,000.
Republican Stronghold Into Dem
ocratic Column Capper
Is Reelected.
Topeka, Kas., Nov. 8. The
election is practically over in
Kansas. - Kansas is safely in the
Wilson column. It has given its.
electoral vote to Wilson by 20,
000. . -
The carrying of the- state by
Woodrow Wilson has been Re-elected
President of the United States
Substantially complete returns from all but four states at five
o'clock Wednesday evening assure Woodrow Wilson 271 electoral
votes. Necessary to elect, 266. The doubtful states are California,
New Hampshire, Oregon and West Virginia.
The West joined the solid south in a purely American vote
and cast the votes that won the greatest political victory in the
history of the United States.
The early returns which indicated a Hughes victory came from
Republican machine strongholds. As soon as the West began , to
report the tide turned and Wednesday morning positive claims of
victory were made.
Reports received up to 1 o'clock this afternoon showed that
Wilson had maintained a strong lend in Minnesota and that the
rural vote whs adding, rather than lessening, the advantage. The
Republicans, while not conceding the state, privately admit that it
voted for Wilson.
Interest turned to California. The contest there was admit
tedly between Los Angeles and San l Yancisco. Through the state
the vote was almost an even break, with, the advantage for Wilson
out of the first 200,000 votes in the country districts.
San Francisco reported at noon that it would give Wilson
from 15,000 to 20,000. From Los Angeles came the news that in
stead of a huge Hughes plurality, the first 123 precincts complete
gave him but a lead of 700 out of 20.000 votes. The Democrats'
have every reason to claim the state for Wilson, but preferred to
keep it in the "doubtful" column until more complete returns arc
received.
In addition to these reports of certain victory, New Mexico
moved from the doubtful to the Wilson column. There is every
probability that Delaware and Oregon will also be changed front
the Huges to Wilson forces. If this occurs Wilson could win with
out either Minnesota or California.
The change from boisterous claims of a Hughes victory with
statements to the public by Colonel Roosevelt declining a place in
the cabinet and George W. Perkins boasting of the power of Wall
street to control a nation, to gloom, was most marked at the Re
publican headquarters...
Tuesday night papers which supported Wilson conceded his de
feat. Wednesday both Republican and Democratic papers are an
nouncing his victory.
' Cm v y I
the majority which it gave for
President Wilson was in line
with the preelection forecast of
Chairman Lardner, who stated
that Kansas would go for Wilson
by a majority of 20,000 to 25,000.
The result means that Kansas
wage earners voted almost solidly
for President Wilson, -as predict
Congressman Dickinson and
I Judge Calvird Re-Elected.
-Congressman C. C - Dickinson
has-been re-elected in the Sixth
District by an enormous majority
nut Judge U. A. Calvird defeated
his opponent C. A. Denton in the
circuit by 2000 votes.
GARDNER ELECTED
GOVERNOR
Reed Wins Over Dickey by From
2K,000 to 90,000.
St. Louis. Mo- Nov. 8. At 1
o'clock this afternoon Chairman
James Cowgill of the Democratic
party claimed the state for Wil
son by upwards of 25,000 and the
enure state ticket. There is a
probability that Auditor Cordon
has been defeated as he ran 20,-
000 behind the ticket in this city.
Senator Keed is reelected over
Dickey by from 20,000 to 30,000
votes. In many parts of the
state he ran ahead of Wilson, not
ably in Buchanan county, where
he led by 2,400 votes and Wilson
by 1,500.
No definite figures have been
obtained on the wet and dry
amendment. This city gave its
usual wet vote, large enough to
offset any dry gains in the state.
Early returns show ' that the
Democrats have, elected 14 Con
gressmen and that the Republi
cans won two in St. Louis. The
vote on congressional candidates
is slow, as special efforts are be
ing made to get the full count on
ly on President, Governor and
Senator. It is apparent that the
Republicans have re-elected
Meeker in the Tenth and" Dyer in
the Twelfth. The Democrats
have" a eood lead in the other dis
tricts except the Thirteenth and
Fourteenth, where the races will
be close.
The Democrats annnrentlv have
won control of the Lecrislntnre.
Figures show the Democrats have
elected id in the senate, the Re
publicans 2 and one is in doubt.
In the house 75 Democrats appear
sure of election, 47 Republicans
and 20 seats are in doubt
