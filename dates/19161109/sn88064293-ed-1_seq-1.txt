PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION
RESULTS NOT YET DECIDED
Has Shade The Best ol The
Reported Situation. Final Outcome
of Big Election Now Controlled By
LiDle Word "IF"
OFFICE OF CONGRESSMAN FROM THIRD DISTRICT CLAIMED
BY BOTH CANDIDATES
The afternoon of this the second
day following the election of Nov
ember 7th finds the situation tense
and with nothing positive as to the
election of a national president or a
congressman from the Third District
of Louisiana. The maze of telegrams
sent out by campaign managers in
both national and district elections
convey only the information that one
of the closest elections in the history
of a state and nation was held on
Tuesday.
The democratic nominee for Con
gress from this district, Wade O.
Martin, was in Morgan City last
night enroute to Thibcdaux and
while here gave out the statement
that he had undoubtedly defeated his
opponent, Whit P. Martin, the Pro
gressive candidate. Mr Martin said
he was assured of a lead of at least
190 votes. Telegraphic advices today,
however, still leave the choice of a
congressman undecided and only the
fact remains that the winner and
loser will be separated by a very
scant vote.
The presidential situation is still
an uncertain quantity. Both sides
have desisted emphatic claims of cer
tainty in the race and the common
position of each of the parties, as far
as their statements concerning the
outcome is concerned, is hedged be
hind a little word fraught with
meaning. The little word is "IF."
If Wilson carries several of the
states still to give in complete re
turns, he will be elected. If Hughes
can add the electoral vote from
these same states to his accumulated
votes, he will be the winner. But
few of the states are yet to give out
complete returns and on the vote of
EVERYTHING IN READINESS FOR
HIE BEAUTIFUL FLOWER-SHOW
Handsome Decorations and Elegantly Displayed Ferns,
Plants and Flowers Await Yon. An Oil Painting
Will be Given to Some Luck' Visitor.
Tomorrow, Friday the 10th, the
1916 Morgan City Flower Show
opens in the City Hall. Friday the
10th and Saturday the 11th—for
two days only—the Flower Show
will be in full blast.
Today, the City Hall is the scene
of great activity and preparation.
Busily the committees, like veritable
bees, buzz from flower to flower and
steadily the green and tinted aval
anch of flowers and ferns and rare
plants are assembled from their con
fused masses of indiscriminate
groups into classes and varieties in
telligently and artistically arranged
in order that the visitors may en
joy them to the fullest degree.
From one end of the city to the
other, cars and carriages and carts,
laden with floral and plant contribu
tions from many homes, hurried and
scurried with their fragrant burdens
to the City Hall. Committees were
everywhere in response to the hund
reds of offers of citizens to furnish
some item or the exhibition. This re
sponse clinches the expectation for a
Flower Show which will be a greater
success than any previous displays
attempted in Morgan City.
i
California, New Hampshire, North
Dakota, New Mexico and Minnesota
hangs the final outcome. Wilson
managers lay positive claim to 251
electorial votes. Hughes managers
are certain of 243 electoral votes.
IF these figures are truthful, then
Wilson has the edge on the situation
and if he carries California and one
other of the states mentioned he
will have secured the additional votes
necessary to win. Mr. Hughes occu
pies the same nervous position with
the exception that he will need all of
the undecided states except Califor
nia, or that he must have California
and two of the other named states.
Wire reports from California are
steady in their statements that Wil
son is leading in California. Mid
night messages from the west gave
Wilson a lead in this state of ten
I thousand. It appears from later tele
grams that the country votes turned
! in since that hour have reduced Wil
I son's lead to 4500.
Telegraphic advices are to the ef
fect that Hughes is ahead in New
Mexico by the small lead of 250 with
a number of precincts to be heard
from.
The Secretary of State has handed
out the statement that Wilson has
carried New Hampshire by 121 votes.
It is his opinon that California is
also safe for Wilson.
Reports from North Dakota gives
Wilson a lead of about 600 votes.
Minnesota is reported safe in the
Hughes column by a 500 majority.
Another factor in deciding the
winner of the presidential election is
said to be the soldier votes on the
border. Several thousand soldiers
whose homes are in the northern

One of the interesting features of
the Exhibition will be the awarding
of a beautiful painting in oil by Mr.
C. S. Gray of Morgan City. Mr.
Gray's artistic offering will be given
to some entrant to the Flower Show
and every person who pays his ten
cents for an admission to the Flower
Show will have an opportunity to be
come owner of the beautiful painting
contributed by Mr. Gray. No extra
i fee is attached to this. It is simply a
feature, made possible by the genor
ositv of Mr. Gray, which the ladies
are providing to add interest to the
occasion.
Friday, during the day, the judges
will pass on the flowers and plants
shown. Friday night, the winners
will be awarded the ribbons. Satur
day the sale of plants will take place
ami a large number of beautiful
plants will be offered for sale at ex
ceedingly low prices. The receipts
from these plants, which have been
contributed for this purpose by local
people, will be used by the ladies in
charge of the Flower Show to help
defray the expense of the exhibition.
Let everyone attend the Flower
Show.
