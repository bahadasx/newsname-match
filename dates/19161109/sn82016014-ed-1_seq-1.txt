(CONVENTION PERSONALS ON
PAGE 6)
Teachers by the hundreds from the
cities, from the little country schools,
from everywhere in Kansas began
pouring into Topeka this morning to
enjoy the fifty-fourth annual session
of the Kansas ttaie leacnera iiutid
tion here today, tomorrow and Satur
day. The registration books in the
state house lobby showed that on the
opening day the attendance is greater
than ever before in the history of the
association. By 6 o'clock this evening
it is expected that the registration will
be 6.000. Before the convention closes
7,000 teacher: are expected here.
PreDaration of the school boy and
girl of today for co-operation in deal- i
ing with social affairs rather than the
individualism of the past was dealt
with jointly this morning by Dr.
George D. Strayer of Columbia univer
sity, and P. P. Claxton. United States
commissioner of education. Both men
spoke in the city auditorium which
was filled with teachers.
The fifty-fourth annual convention
opened with prayer by Dr. Charles M.
Sheldon of the Central Congregational
church. This was followed by music
on the pipe organ and a vocal solo of
much merit by Miss Edith Bideau.
Laws Rule Now.
Briefly the speakers sketched the
passing of the good, old days when a
man could make a living independent
ly of others, could travel independent
ly of the social and industrial customs
of others. Now no one can travel any
where without finding himself forced
to abide by social and industrial cus
toms of the people.
"No democracy can stand unless
there are enough men who will sacri
fice their individual aims for the bene
fit of the common good," declared
Doctor Strayer.
Then the speakers outlined the need
of teaching co-operation among pupils
at the schools, teaching them by prac
tice the ideals of obligation, duty and
service to the group in which they live.
Teaching: Too Autocratic.
Th"e present method of teaching is
too autocratic, the speakers told the
teachers. Pupils seek more to please
a teacher by their individualism in
recitation than thru the results of co
operation which ultimately will be the
only salvation of themselves and the
nation.
The teachers were urged to create
in their pupils the need of helping one
another, of making combined rather
than individual efforts to reach a goal.
Instances whore teachers had puoils
aid others, less apt in certain studies
were pointed out as methods of re
ducing the individualistic tendencies
of the time.3 and creating the spirit of
co-operation in which all work for
the good of a community rather than
for individual results, only.
Then, too, the education of a pupil's
reasoning powers instead of memoriz
ing powers was urged upon the
teachers
Must Think Xot Memorize.
"Too many pupils memorize thei
lessons and do not reason them out
declared Dr. Strayer. "This is simpl.
J
Superintendent J. H. Francis of Co
lumbus, Ohio, who delivered an ad
dress to the state teachers at the
high school auditorium today.
because a surface, book knowledge is
all that is required."
He told of a teacher who had the
pupils discuss the reasons for famines
in India. This discussion brought out
their reasoning powers for they were
forced to understand the physical
conditions in and surrounding India,
the weather conditions and soil condi
tions. "They learned to reason and ac
quired geography at the same time,"
said Dr. Strayer. "We must teach the
pupils to assemble facts and arrive at
conclusions in their own minds. There
are too many people who will read
the editorials in a morning paper and
stand by those convictions until the
evening paper is on the street with
facts apparently as convincing and
then change their minds."
L. W. Mayberry, president of the
association, presided at the meeting.
Ten special trains arrived in To
peka Wednesday night and today,
i . jted over the- Santa Fe, Rock Island,
Union Pacific and Missouri Pacific

vere nervous shock.
While a number of its passengers
were eating in the diner. Rock Island
train No. 4, known as the tioiaen iaie
Limited, was wrecked p. short distance
east of Newman, twelve miles east of
Topeka, at 6:30 o'clock last night.
The wreck occurred when a flange
on a wheel under the second car of
the train broke. The car swayed and
turned over on its side, dragging the
rest of the six cars behind with it.
Four of the cars were thrown com
petely on their sides while the last
three coaches were nearly overturned.
The engine and mail car were cut
loose from the train.
At noon today G. B. Hetherington,
trainmaster for the Kansas division of
the Rock Island, stated that not
enough information was available to
fix the cause of the derailment of the
Golden State Limited, which went into
the ditch at Newman, twelve miles
east of Lawrence, at 6:30 o'clock last
night. Mr. Hetherington had just re
turned from the wreck.
At that time two wreckers, one a
Union Pacific, the other a Rock Is
land, were removing the debris. One
; line of track was open and trains were
being routed thru. The other line of
track was still blocked, and it was not
stated when it would be opened.
It was stated that the two passen
gers most badly injured, who are in
Stormont hospital, were doipg well. It
was not believed then that either
would die. The two in the hospital
are M. T. Ransom of Wichita, left
shoulder and clavicle fractured, and
R. L. Taylor, of Los Angeles, colored
chef, badly scalded.
Six persons were reported Injured
this morning, none of them fatally.
With the exception of M. T. Ransom,
of Wichita, and R. L. Taylor, the
negro chef, who was badly scalded,
both of whom were taken to Stormont
hospital here, the rest of the passen
gers continued on their way to Kan
sas City. The scant number of in
jured reported is due to the unusually
small number of passengers according
to J. W. Stevens, the Pullman car
conductor.

TEXT BOOK FIGHT
AMONG TEACHERS
IS OPENED TODAY
Resolutions Prepared Would
Open Up Book Buying.
Direct Slap at State' Publication
May Be Result.
DEMAND DISTRICT OWNERSHIP
TVonld Permit School Boards to
Buy in Open Market.
TV. A. Brandenburg of Pittsburg
Mentioned as President.
Fireworks over the state text, book
proposition opened early today, at the
forty-fifth annual convention of the
Kansas State Teachers' association.
Whether the apparent split between
officials of the association and the
present method of state selection of
school books becomes deeper tonight
depends upon the outcome of a meet
ing of the resolutions committee, late
this afternoon, in the office of W. D.
Ross, superintendent of public in
struction. At that time it will be decided
whether the resolutions committee
shall submit to the board of directors
at Its meeting tonight an amendment
which, if adopted by the board and
teachers in session tomorrow, will
place the association on record as say
ing: "The children of Kansas have a
right to the best books, regardless of
whether they are the product of state
publication or private publication."
Still further trouble over the school
book commission problem was -prom
ised, at a late hour this afternoon,
when F. L. Pinet, secretary of the
state association, appeared at the of
fice of W. D. Ross, state superintend
ent, and announced that he had a
resolution to be presented to the reso
lutions committee. Pinet's resolution
will ask that the legislature refrain
from taking any further steps in push
ing the state publication propaganda
for two years at least.
Meantime, it is proposed in the re
solution, that a committee of educa
tors be appointed to investigate state
publication from a strictly educational
standpoint. At the same time Pinet's
resolution would provide for an in
vestigation of state publication from
a dollar and cent standpoint by a
cost expert.
In addition a section would be add
ed reading:
"We favor the compulsory district
ownership of text books and the right
to select them from the best on the
open market."
The latter part of the resolution is
the one looked upon with alarm by
friends of the text book commission.
It directly provides for the abolish
ment of the compulsory adoption of
the state, as at present, and, accord
ing to statements of friends of the
commission, would give the agents of
the big eastern book concerns an op
portunity to work on the hundreds of
members or school boards in Kansas.
"However," said A. M. Thoroman,
"it will take some time for such legis
lation to get thru the house and senate
of Kansas. '
Committee on Record.
At a meeting of the resolutions com
mittee a month ago, resolutions were
adopted by the committee for the ap
proval of the board and association,
placing the association on record as:
"Favoring such a modification of the
laws relating to the school book com
mission as will put the selection of
textbooks in the hands of active teach
ers and favoring in the selection of
books the consideration of quality
not price."
"Suddenly," said M. E. Moore, of
Leavenworth, chairman of the resolu
tions committee, "some of the mem-,
bers ot tne committee demanded the
district' ownership amendment."
Mr. Moore stated that he had in
vited A. M. Thoroman, secretary of the
state school book commission, to be
present at the meeting. At 1:30
o'clock this afternoon Thoroman de
clared he had not received the invita
tion. W. R. Smith, state printer and
chairman of the commission, also de
clared he had re.Xlived no invitation
to the meeting.
There appears to be no fight for
the presidency. A r.umber of names
have been mentioned but W. A. Bran
denburg, president of the Pittsburg
Manual Training school, seems to be
the man most of those "outside of the
inside" think will be selected by the
board of directors, at their meeting
tonight.
ROYAL FLYER MISSING
Baron Lucas Either Killed or Cap
tured by Germans.
London, Nov. 9. Baron Lucas of
Grudwell, a member of the Royal Fly
ing corps and formerly parliamentary
under secretary of state for war, has
either been captured by the Germans
or killed on the French battlefield, ac
cording to the Evening Star.
Lord Lucas was reconnoitering over
the German lines of France in an
aeroplane, the newspaper says, and
was obliged to descend behind the
German lines owing to a gale.

Warn Ballot Box Watchers to

New York, Nov. 9. Charges that
the Republican election officials in
New Hampshire were unfair In the
vote count there, by which they gave
the state to Hughes by 161 votes was
made today by Henry Morganthau,
chairman of the Democratic finance
committee.
"We will demand and get a recount
there," he said. "It will be very queer
if we can not get In 150 or 200 votes
in this way. The Republicans control
the election machinery and it is only
natural that a recount would give us
a gain under such circumstances.
These officials have given ua no vote
we were not entitled to and they have.
taken a large number of votes away
from us that we were entitled to.
Morganthau's charge was in answer
to a statement by George W. Perkins.
Instructions to the Democratic com
mittee in New Hampshire to demand
the recount had already gone forward.
he said.
Nerves Are Frayed.
The situation today was one irbieri
pulled taut the already overstrained
nerves of political managers. .It was
responsible for more acrimonious ex
changes between the two sides than
heretofore marked the campaign. It
brought warnings from Democratic
Chairman McCormick to his cohorts to
'guard ballot boxes," lest there be
tampering. It inspired Republican
Chairman Willcox bitterly to reDlv
that any one intimating fraud by Re-
puDiicans - was a contemptible scoun
drel" and issued a warning himself
against stealing of the presidency by
the Democrats. In at least one state

MAY WAIT WEEK
2,136 Minnesota Guards' Vote
May Decide Issue.
But These Won't Be Counted
Until Tuesday.
St. Paul, Minn., Nov. 9. With 2,136
Minnesota militiamen's votes cast at
the border and not expected to be
counted before next Tuesday, the
world may wait another week to know
who will be president of the United
States, if Minnesota is to be given the
proud privilege of deciding that issue.
Six commissioners who took these
ballots to the border to be marked by
the militiamen, are en route back to
Minnesota today. They are due Sun
day. Both parties claim the militia
vote. Division of staff officers in re
cent political ventures is half and half.
MAY SPLIT VOTE
Prospect for California Vote
To Be Divided.
Not Improbable; It Happened
Four Years Ago.
San Francisco, Cal., Nov. 9. The
possibility that California may cast a
divided vote in the electoral college
was discussed by politicians today as
they watched the returns slowly com
ing in rrom vjaniorma precincts.
Under tne law, the thirteen candi
dates for elector who receive the larg
est vote will go to the electoral col
lege, regardless of whether they all
favor the same presidential candidate.
It is possible for the high man of one
set of thirteen electors to be higher
than the low man of the set of electors
whose party candidate receives the
majority of the electoral votes.
Four years ago this happened. Wil

Wilson Gets North Dakota by 1,000.
Fargo, Nov. 9. With from five to
seven precincts missing in each of ap
proximately thirty counties in North
Dakota, a majority of them being in
the western part of the state where
telephone and telegraph communica
tions are not highly developed, it is
not expected that complete returns
will be received until some time late
in the day. Reports were received up
to an early hour this morning which
gave President Wilson a lead of some
thing more than 1,000 votes over
Hughes.

Returns from 1.952 precincts:
Wilson 248,093
Hughes 218,276
Governor.
Returns from 1,698 precincts:
Capper . ; 231,749
Lansdon 132,775
Kansas will boost the Wilson presi
dential plurality above the 30;000
mark. It may go to 32,500 or even
35,000. That is greater than any dream
of the most ardent and enthusiastic
Democrat. With nearly 800 precincts
to report governorship totals. Gover
nor Capper is now hanging languidly
on the 100,000 mark and looks safe by
125,000 or more.
Today the Democrats are simply
dazzled and bewildered by their show
ing in .the state. On the eve of the
election, when the Democrats claimed
everything in sight, Hubert Lardner,
chairman of the state committee, put
the Wilson plurality at 11,000 to
'12,000. - Then he knocked on wood
and- wished dreams might come true.
Now Lardner is submerged in good
news 6f which he never dreamed and
never permitted himself to think.
Total figures this afternoon from
1,952 of the 2,474 precincts of Kansas
give Wilson 248,093 and Hughes 218,
276 a skimpy 30,000. But there are
more than 500 precincts out and Wil
son keeps growing as reports some to
Topeka. Use your own judgment as
to where it will stop.
Do your own guessing on governor,
also. If it were but possible to slice a
few thousand off the Capper returns
and add them to the Hughes column,
the Republicans would be happy. In
1,698 precincts. Capper has 231,749
votes and Lansdon 132,775.
Congressional Fight.
The Republicans dented the Demo
crat congressional stronghold by the
election of Col. Ed. C. Little over Con
gressman Joseph Taggart. That was
as far as the winning went. Right
there the Bourbon line held and Kan
sas voted to return the five remaining
Democrat congressmen.
In the Fourth district Congressman
Dudley Doolittle won a close fight
over Clyde W. Miller. Doolittle s ma
jority over Miller will probably be
something less than 500, altho returns
from all counties in the district seem
to give him a safe lead and the elec
tion. Miller and his managers have
conceded the election to Doolittle.
Charles M. Harger's chances in the
Fifth district went down when the

This announcement was given out
New York, Nov. 9. The tide for
Wilson set in so 6trong in California
and Minnesota this afternoon that it
appeared probable at 3:45 this after
noon returns from these two states
would indicate the president's re
election. Two Philadelphia newspapers which
have strongly supported Hughes in
the campaign this afternoon conceded
their candidate's defeat.
They were the Evening Ledger and
the North American.
The belief that the Wilson drift
would result in his choice was based
on these developments:
Hughes must carry both Minnesota
and California to win.
Wilson's lead in California is stead
ily maintained.
Hughes's lead in Minnesota is being
cut down as further returns come in.
The precise drift in these states and
in the other smaller doubtful states of
New Hampshire and New Mexico
showed on the United Press returns
available at 3:45:
California, 5,692 out of 5,867 pre
cincts: Wilson leading by 5,055 votes;
to come 175 precinctsL
New Hampshire, 248 out of 294 pre

come 302.

Democratic State Chairman Cushing
maintained an air of confidence as
the presidential candidates turned into
the home stretch. He said the eigh
teen remaining precincts in Los
Angeles county would not give Hughes
a sufficient plurality to overcome Wil
son's lead. On the other hand he de
clared that missing precincts from
other sections of the state will un
doubtedly throw the strength to Wil
son and more than offset whatever
advantage Los Angeles county gives
Hughes.

Kansas Republicans May Ques

Suit In Supreme Court to Test
Law's Constitutionality. -
ROW OVER ELECTORS' CHOICE
Lawyers Claim Cross Should Be
Behind Their Names.
G. O. P. Has Everything to Win
and Nothing to Lose.
With every state a pivotal state and .
with every vote needed by each can
didate for the presidency, the Re
publicans may contest the Kansas
electoral vote. This plan was worked
out early In the week by the Demo
crats. Nov the Republicans are con
sidering the plan of attack antlclpat-
d by the enemy.
In event of a confest, suit will b
filed in the supreme court to test the
constitutionality of the Kansas system
or voting for presidential electors.
This year Kansas voted in a square
opposite the name of presidential can
didates. Votes were not cast for in
dividual electors. According to a
theory of many lawyers, the constitu
tion specifically provides that electors
shall be chosen, who shall chose the
president. A successful contest by the
republicans would result In throwing
out the electoral vote of the state
That would mean that ten votes would
be taken from the Wilsin column,
altho none would be added to th
Hughes string.

that New Hampshire Democrats would

the vote in that state, and cause a re

a contest In this state. Questions sur
rounding the constitutionality of the

Statement by G. O. P.
Phillip H. Faulkner, chairman of
the Republican state committee, is
sued the following statement:
The claim that New Hampshire
has gone for Wilson is unsubstantiat
ed by any returns in our possession.
"Fully 40 per cent of the town clerks
thruout the state have rendered no
official returns of the vote but such
unofficial figures as we have, verified
in every quarter of the state, indicate
that Mr. Hughes has carried New
Hampshire by something less than 100
plurality.
"We have well fortified Information
officers in the counitng of votes in
many quarters and we have today in
stituted proceedings for an inspection
of all the votes cast in the state on
Tuesday, as our law provides.
Contest the Vote.
"George A. Fairbanks of Newport,
one of the Hughes presidential elec
tors, is the petitioner in this action.
and we expect to have the New Hamp
shire ballots in the hands of the secre
tary of state by the close of another
day.
"We do not concede New Hampshire
to the Democrats and are prepared to
substantiate our claim of Republican
victory before any competent tribunal."
