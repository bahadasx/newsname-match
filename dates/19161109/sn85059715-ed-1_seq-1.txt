Minnesota and California Are
Coming Nicely into the Repufcl'can
Column.
BOTH SIDES~ A EE SURE
Great Changes in Pivotal States
as Late Returns Show Are
Favorable to Hughes.
< * A&soctATco rmcnt>
NEW YORK, Nov. 'j.- The election
passed into the second day of uncertainty
with President Wilson and
Charles E. Hughes both anxiously
awaiting the count in a few western
states, the pivotal ones being California
with thirteen electoral votes, and
Minnesota with twelve. New Mexico
with three, and North Dakota with
five.
Although still so close that the result
could not be regarded as assured.
indicative overnight returns
seemed to dispose oi previously
doubtful stales by placing West Virginia's
eight votes in the Hughes column
and giving the four votes of
Idaho and seven from Washington to
President Wilson.
The Hughes total thus became 247
and the Wilson total 251, with 26G
necessary to elect.
After so disposing of these previously
doubtful states from which the
returns are still incomplete the situation
appeared to be as follows:
President Wilson can win with
either California or Minnesota, but in
addition must get either North Dakota
or New Mexico.
\Tf Hiifiiw to u-in must have both
California, and Minnesota, or either
one and in addition both North Dakota
and New Mexico.
In California President Wilson had
a lead of nearly 5.000 with one-tenth
of the state's precincts missing. Of
the 570 missing. 143 are in Republican
strongholds, and the others
are in northern districts where the
president's vote has be^n heavy. Both
party managers claim the state.
In Minnesota, the most dramatic
race of all was being run hour by
hour. During yesterday President
Wilson's lead of 10.000 slowly melted
down before the Hughes vote from
the rural districts until it was wiped
out. Then the Wilson vote began
coming in again only to be offset by
a Hughes burst, and so the contest
whip sawed all night with first one
ahead and then the other. Early this
morning with about 5,000 precincts
unreported. Hughes was ahead with
less than 1.000.
Wilson had a lead of over 1.000
votes on the latest returns from
North Dakota, with nearly 200 districts
unreported. Both party leaders
claimed the state..
With the count hair in rrom .-New
Mexico. Mr. Hughes had a margin of
Jess than 300 votes over President
Wilson. Returns from outlying districts
are expected to come in slowly
todny.
The latest returns from Washington
apparently carried that state into
the Democrtaic column.
Wilson had a lead of over 9.000
vol's on the latest figures with about
500 districts missing.
Idaho was taken from the doubtful
column at an early hour and again
given to Wilson who had a lead of
13.000 votes on the last returns. Less
than 200 districts were unreported.
Hughes has a lead of 3,500 votes
on today's returns from West Virginia
with only about 400 districts
unreported.
Returns from the missing districts
in the doubtful states were anxlousl.v
sougbt by campaign managers. Both
sides claim the election of their respective
candidates and it was evi.
dent plans were made to demand rc
JH counts and In some cases to carry to"
contests into the courts.
