that with the New Hampshire r

What Both Candidates Need. ?
After so din nosing: of these previous- I
ly doubtful states, from which the re- j
turns still are incomplete, the situation i
appeared to be as follows: [
President Wilson can win with either I
California or Minnesota, but in addition j
must get New Hampshire. North Da

In California President Wilson had a '
lead of nearly 5,000, with one-tenth of
the state's precincts missing. Of the
570 missing 143 are in the republican
stronghold and the others are in northern
districts where the President's vote
. has been heavy.
Both party managers claim the state. !
Ir? Minnesota the most dramatic race j
of all jk-as being run hour by hour.
During yesterday President Wilson's
lead of 10.000 slowly inelted down before
the Hughes vote from the rural
districts until it was wiped out. Then
the Wilson votes began coming in j
again, only to be ofTset by a Hughes
burst, and so the contest whipsawed
all night, with first one ahead and then
the other. Early this morning with
about 500 precincts unreported Hughes
was ahead with less than 1,000.

Mr. Wilson had a lead of over a thousand
votes on the latest returns from
North Dakota with nearly 200 districts

democratic parties were unwilling to I
concede, here this afternoon, that the'
opposing presidential candidate had received
a sufficient number of electoral
votes to win. Meanwhile it was indicated
at both headquarters that in
states where the vote ^ras close a recount
would be demanded. Both sides
again announced they were taking precautions
to guard ballot boxes.
Vance C. McCormlck, democratic
chairman, reiterated emphatically his
claim of yesterday that President Wilson
would be re-elected with 288 electoral
votes, twenty-two more than
enough to bring him the victory. Mr.

both democratic and republican headquarters
today. Both sides claimed the

being made to demand recounts, and in
some cases to carry the contests into
the courts.
Willcox Orders Counsel Engaged.
Numerous conferences were held at
both headquarters, and there were unconfirmed
reports that Chairman William

chairmen in the various doubtful states
to guard the ballot boxes and protest

assist the national committee in any

make any charges of fraud, but said
he desired to be in a position to take

DEMOCRATS AHEAD
IN FIGHT FOR HOUSE
i Sixteen Congressional Districts
Are Yet to Be
Heard From.
G. 0. P. GAINS ARE LARGE
With sixteen congressional districts tc
be heard from, the House of Representatives
seems to be in the hands of th?
democrats again, unless the republicans
have overturned nine democratk
districts. The latest accurate compilation
gives t^e democrats 212 House seats
republicans 203, two progressives, anc
sixteen undecided.
Sevent of these sixteen districts art
democratic in the present Congress anc
nine are republican. Should each keei
to its present political affiliation the
count would stand: Democrats, 219
republicans, 212, which would give th?
democrats a majority of three over th?
212 republicans and 4 representatives
of other parties in the bouse.
If all missing districts retain their present
political complexion, the democrats
will control the House by the slender majority
of five, their total being 220 to 211,
with four scattering members belonging
to other minority parties.
Republican Gains Large.
Republican gains for House seats
were large in Wisconsin, where three
democratic House members were defeated.
Representative Stafford of Milwaukee
has defeated his ancient opponent,
former Representative Berger,
the socialist, and a republican has defeated
Representative M. E. Burke, a
capable Wisconsin democrat. Miss
Jeannette Rankin, the Montana suffragist,
claims to have won.
Representative Buchanan, democrat
of Illinois, has been upset by a republican.
and Representative Tavenner,
democrat, of Illinois, on whom a particularly
seyere attack was made by
ft?e republicans, libs been beaten badly
by a republican. One of the "real surnrises
was the defeat of Representative
frhlker of Massachusetts, a republican.
An independent candidate named Fuller
has been elected in the Walker district.
after political sharps called the
re-election of Walker a "sure thing."
Contest a Possibility.
In Maryland, there is so close a vote
in the first district that Robert F.
Duer, the defeated republican, may
bring a contest against Jesse D. Price,
democrat.
West Virginia's congressional race is
extremely close.
Returns from 236 precincts out of
266 in first district give Fleming (rep.),
18,698; Nesley (dem.), 19,455.
Returns from 176 precincts out of
323 in second district give Bowers

DEMAND A RECOUNT
IN NEW HAMPSHIRE
Democrats Act Despite Lead
There?Both Headquarters
Remain Confident.
"FRAUD" CRY DENOUNCED
By the Associated Press.
NEW YORK, November 9.?Henry
Morgenthau, in charge of democratic
headquarters, this morning, in the ab
sence of Chairman McCormick, said
that a recount would be demanded for
the vote in New Hampshire. This, he
said, would be done in spite of the figures
received this morning showing
that Wilson had a lead of 93 votes. He
added that the democratic figures show
that the Wilson lead was 500 votes, and
in view of the complex situation in
that state a recount in any event would
be necessary. Instructions to the democratic
committee in New Hampshire
to demand the recount had already
gone forward, he said.
What Bival Camps Say.
Statements were issued from both
democratic and national headquarters
this morning still claiming the pivotal
states for the respective parties.
"When I retired at 5 o'clock," said
Chairman McCormick, in a statement
telephoned from his hotel, "I knew that
North Dakota was safe for Wilson,
California absolutely ours, that we had
New Mexico surely and that we are
putting up a good fight in Minnesota."
George W. Perkins, at republican
headquarters, declared that New Mexico
and Minnesota were both swinging
toward Hughes and that North Dakota
was sure. He asserted that if these
three states were placed in the Hughes
column the republican candidate's
election was assured without California's
thirteen electoral votes.
;xo out wasmngton case.
Chairman McCormick today said he
would Investigate reports received at
democratic headquarters that the republicans
in Washington state may get
one of the democratic electoral votes
on the ground that votes cast for one
of the democratic electors who died
were invallid. According to the reports
the name of E. M. Connor, the
democratic elector who was substituted
for A. Stream, the dead elector, did not
appear on the ballot in many counties,
and it was stated that therefore the
votes cast for Stream might be invalid,
the difference giving a plurality for one
republican elector.
"We will investigate the matter,"
I said Chairman McCormick: "but even
if we were forced to concede the vote
{ I am not worried by the loss of one
j electoral vote."
I Chairman McCormick reappeared at
democratic headquarters shortly after
11 o'clock.
"It's all over" he said. "We have
cleaned them up. We stick unflinchingly
to our original figures: Wilson,
by 28S electoral votes."
Mr. McCormick added that every precaution
was being taken to protect the
ballot boxes where the vote was running
close.
Chairman Willcox's Statement.
Republican Chairman William R.
Willcox at noon made this statement
in regard to the matter of supervising
the counting of votes in close states:
"So far as the claims of the Wilson
, followers go they began to cry fraud
S before the election. The history or that
i party is such that it ill becomes them
to raise the cry of fraud at this time.
All right thinking people concerned in
the election want an honest count. The
republican national committee will insist
that the votes cast for its candidate
be counted for him. but we want
no votes ndt properly cast.
"We will take every step to see that
the votes cast are properly counted.
The bluster of the democratic leaders
has no effect on our effort to see that
an honest count shall be had.
Seeing: That Laws Are Obeyed.
"We have not called upon the Attorney
General of the United States for
United States district attorneys or othjer
officials of the government to supervise
the counting of votes in any state.
The voting machinery of each state is
under the administration of state authorities.
and our representatives in
each state will take all needful steps
to see that the election laws have been
obeyed and all votes properly counted.
I "The call for an honest count which
i we demand would be joined in and will
be requested by all right-thinking citiIzens
of whatever party.
"We are entirely willing to have every
dollar of our expenditures investigated
in the most thorough manner.
| We have made reports in detail under
'the law, and if other details are wantled
we will give them. 1 leave it to our
! democratic opponents to say whether
| they will do the same."
C. B. Warren's Statement.
i ^Charles B. Warren, republican national
committeeman rnyn Micnigan. alter a
conference with Chairman Willcox and
other national committeemen, gave out j
this statement as reflecting the consensus
of opinion among the republican lead-J
ers:
"The election depends upon the count in
California, Minnesota, North Dakota. New I
Mexico and New Hampshire. Oregon is
safely for Hughes, as is also "West Virginia.
The probabilities are that the Minnesota
vote will be cast for Hughes, but
the official count will be required in North
Dakota. New Mexico. New Hampshire and
California before the results in those
states will be definitely known."
Has Evidence of Irregularity.
Philip H. Faulkner, chairman of the
republican state committee, issued the
following statement today: "The claim
that New Hampshire has gone for Wilson

Outlying Districts May Change
Result From One Candidate
to Another.
SMALL LEAD FOR HUGHES
By the Associated Press.
ST. PALL, Minn., November 9^
Fred B. Lynch, democratic as- I
tional committeeman from Minnesota,
today reiterated hi* previous
assertion that President Wilson will
carry Minnesota "by from 500 to
l.OOO" plurality, but that the vote
of the state guardsmen at the Mexican
border would be necessary to
decide the contest.
ST. PAUL, Minn., November 9.?The
lateness of the closing hour of the polls
in Minnesota put the start of counting
election ballots several hours behind
that in most states. Poor wire facilities
in many sections added to the delay,
while the close contest made returns
from the most remote precincts
unusually important.
In several counties, amendments,
which made the ballots longer than
usual, added to the difficulties of the
count. Tabulators early today used every
means at their disposal to reach the outlying
districts, which may at any time
change the outlook over the stale from
one candidate to the other.
During the early morning Mr. Hughes
jumped into the lead, and the increasing
returns had accumulated a pluralj
ity of over 1.200 votes for him by 10
o'clock. At this point the republican
advance was checked and ensuing returns
showed fluctuating advantages
for each candidate, the Hughes plural
ity being slowly cut into until at 1
o'clock he had a scant 307 votes in his
favor.
How the Count Developed.
Returns for President from 2,511 pre
cincts out of 3,024 in Minnesota give
Wilson 162,379 and Hughes 161,301, a
Hughes plurality of 922.
Later, 2,516 precincts out of 3,024 In
the state give: Wilson, 162,656; Hughes,
163,889; plurality of 1,233 for Hughes.
For President, from 2,518 precincts
out of 3,024 in the state give Wilson
162,911 and Hughes 163,911, a plurality
of 1.000 for Hughes.
Returns for President from 2,534 precincts
out of 3,024 in the state give
Wilson 163,959 and Hughes le4,756, a
Hughes plurality of 797. \
Returns from 2,576 precincts out of
3,024 in the state give Wilson 165,635
and Hughes 166,727, a plurality of 1,092
for Hughes.
Returns for President from 2,636 precincts
out of 3,024 in Minnesota give:

rality of 510 for Hughes.
Returns for President from 2,660 precim-ts
out ?f 3.024 in Minnesota give:
