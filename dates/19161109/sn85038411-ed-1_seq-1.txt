Western Pivotal States Will Decide Result; West Virginia

come May Not Be Known Until Tonight
New York, Nov. 9.—lf the result of the incomplete returns of
Tuesday's balloting are accepted as final in all but five states at noon
to-day the electoral vote would give President Wilson 251 and Mr.
Hughes 243.
The five doubtful states with their electoral votes are: Califor
nia, 13; Minnesota, 12; New Mexico, 3; North Dakota, 5; New
Hampshire, 4.
The sudden switch of New Hampshire from a small Hughes
plurality to 93 votes for President Wilson was the dramatic change
in the situation this forenoon. It came in an announcement from
the Secretary of State that a partial official count of all the districts
disclosed errors in tabulation by town and ward clerks to that ex
tent. The official count is still progressing.
Hughes Leading in Two States
In Minnesota and New Mexico the incomplete returns show Mr.
Hughes to have the lead while in California and North Dakota Mr.
Wilson is leading.
The returns from doubtful western states are belated and not
expected to be available before a late hour to-day.
Although still so close that the result could not be regarded
as assured, indicative overnight returns seemed to dispose of
previously doubtful states by placing West Virginia's eight votes
in the Hughes column and giving the four votes of Idaho and seven
from Washington to President Wilson.
The Hughes total thus became 243 and the Wilson total 251
with 266 necessary to elect.
After so disposing of these previous
ly doubtful States, from which the re
turns still are incomplete the situ
ation appeared to be as follows:
President Wilson can win with
either California or Minnesota, but
in addition must get either North Da
kota or New Mexico.
Mr. Hughes to win must have both
California and Minnesota, or either
one and in addition both North Da
kota and New Mexico.
Hughes Gaining in California
In California President Wilson had
a lead of nearly 5,000 with one-tenth
of the State's precincts missing, Of
the 570 missing 143 ore in the Repub
lican stronghold and the others are
in northern districts where the Presi
dent's vote has been heavy. Both
party managers claim the State.

In Minnesota the most dramatic
race of all was being run hour by
hour. During yesterday President
Wilson's lead of 10,000 slowly melted
down before the Hughes vote from the
rural districts, until it was wiped out.
Then the Wilson votes began coming
in again only to be offset by a Hughes
burst, and so the contest whip-sawed
all night with first one ahead and then
the other. Early this morning with
about 500 precincts unreported Hughes
was ahead with less than 1,000.
Mr. Wilson had a lead of over a
thousand votes on the latest returns
from North Dakota with nearly 200
districts unreported. Both party' lead
ers claimed the election.
With the count half in from New
Mexico, Mr. Hughes had a margin of
less than 300 votes over President Wil
son. Returns from far outlying-dis
tricts arc expected to come in slow
ly.
Washington Democratic
The latest returns from Washington
early to-day apparently carried that
State into the Democratic column.
President Wilson had a lead of over
9,000 votes on the latest figures with
about 500 districts missing.
Idaho was taken from the doubtful
column at an early hour and again
given to President Wilson, who had a
lead of over 13,000 votes on the last
returns. Less than 200 districts have
not reported.
Mr. Hughes has a lead of over 3,500
votes on the returns early to-day
from West Virginia, with only about
400 districts unreported.
Returns from the missing districts
in the doubtful States -were anxiously
sought by the campaign managers at
both Democratic and Republican
headquarters to-day. Both sides
claimed the election of their respective
candidates and it was evident that
Plans were being made to demand re
counts and in some cases to carry the
contests into the courts.
Recounts Appear Probable
Numerous conferences were held at
both headquarters and there were un
confirmed reports that Chairman Wil
liam R. Willcox of the Republican Na
tional committee after talking over
the situation with the Hughes leaders
had advised national committeemen in
certain States to engage counsel in
event that recount proceedings might
be instituted.
It was commonly reported that re
count proceedings will be instituted in
all doubtful States. Chairman Vance
C. McCormlck, of the Democratic Na
tional committee, following his or
der to the chairmen in the various
doubtful States to guard the ballot
boxes and protect the count, engaged
special counsel to assist the national
committee In any legal steps It may
desire to undertake. Chairman Ma-
Cormlck did not make any charges of
fraud but said he desired to be in a
position to take any legal action that
might be necessary. Quo warranto
proceedings looking to a recount In
Now Hampshire are already under
way.
Chairman Willcox declared himself
confident that Mr. Hughes had been
elected. "We only ask what is fair."
said Mr. Willcox, "and we only want

'"Penn-Harris" Likely to
Be Name of New Hotel
Details of management and other
important particulars of Harrisburg's
new million-dollar hotle are being
whipped into shape by tho board of
directors. Several conferences have
been held during the last few days
and it is expected that important an
nouncements will be made within the
week. While no definite decision had
been made as to a name the directors
seem to be favorable to the sugges
tion of "Penn-Harris" which was sug
gested by several persons. This name
comprehends the Commonwealth and
the city by the inclusion of the names
of the founders.
With the building of two large
structures, the new high school and
the hotel, building operations will be
given a good start in this city after
the first of January. Other proiects
are also tinder consideration which in
dicate a lively building year.
