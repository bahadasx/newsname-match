Morgenthau and
Perkins Mix in
rFest of Charges
PHILADELPHIA, Now. 9.—The Philadelphia North American,
one of the atrongeat republican paper* In the atate, poated a bulletin
thi* afternoon, conceding the election of Prealdent Wllaon.
PHILADELPHIA. Nov. 9. —The Evening Ledger, atrong Hughe*
supporter, i«*ued extra* today, conceding the reelection of Wil*on.
NEW YORK, Nov. 9.—Charge that the republican
election officers in New Hampshire were unfair in the
count there, by which they gave the state to Hughes by
161 votes, was made today by Henry Morgenthau, chair
man of the democratic finance committee.
"We will demand and get a recount there," he said.
"It will be very queer if we cannot gain 150 or 200
votes in this way. The republicans control the election
machinery and it is only natural that a recount would
five us a gain under such circumstances. T«?»e offi
cials have given us no vote we were not entitled to, and
A-v have taken a large number of votes away from us
t >4we were entitled to."
NEW YORK. Nov 9—"We don't trust the democrat*
any further than they are said to have remarked they would
trust us," was tieorge W. Perkins' retort today when asked
for comment on the statement of Henry Morgenthau, demo
cratic finance chairman, hintint: at republican "counting out"
of democratic votes.
"We arc taking just a* many precaution* a* the demo
crats," I'erkins said.
Perkins said his tabulation showed 2<>7 electoral \'otes
for Hughes—not including California.
Perkins stated that returns at 6a. m indicated that
Hughes would carry New Mexico by fOO He declared there
no longer was any doubt regarding New Mexico.
WASHINGTON. Nov. 9.—A

known today.

taken.
JPHICAGO, Nov 9—Frank C.
D«!iey, who prosecuted the Terre
Haite vote fraud* for the federal
government, made a hurried trip to
Congressman Miller
With John F. Miller in the house of represen
tatives in place of Humphrey, this district will have
a man at Washington who will be broader minded
and better attuned to the present-day intelligence
of his constituents. Moreover, Miller can make
friends.
The Star is as sincerely satisfied that Miller
replaces Humphrey as that Wilson carried the state
of Washington and that Miles Poindexter, the pro
gressive, won such an overwhelming victory.
While Congressman-elect Miller has not been
as progressive as The Star hopes he will prove to
be, he is a representative citizen of this congres
sional district and a man who has not been "hand
■picked" for the important office he is to hold.
He is today a broader minded man than he
probably was a few years ago. As congressman,
he will have further opportunity to grow and ex
pand and acquire further broadness of vision.
John F. Miller is fully capable of giving genuine
public service. He is free to act upon the merits
of propositions without narrow partisanship. The
Star wishes him well.
Good luck to you, Congressman Miller.

SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 9.—Returns at 1:30 p. m. from
5,705 precincts in out of 5,867, gave Hughes 454,210;
Wilson 458.769. This gives Wilson a lead of 4,559 on the
face of the returns.
NEW YORK. Nov. 9.—The republican national commit
tee today-posted on its bulletin board the statement that by
unofficial complete returns from New Hampshire, the state
had gone to Wilson by 171 votes.
NEW YORK, Nov. #.—Democratic National Chairman McCormlck
thl» afternoon wired all atate chairmen that Wllaon'a election wm
an absolute certainty and to procur* all the red (ire possible and
ttart the celebratiena tonight.
ST. PAUL, Nov. 9 (12:30 p. m.).—Of the 346 Mia
nesota precincts which are still out, 230 are in counties
which have on partial returns given Wilson the best of it.
Fifty-one are in counties where partial returns show prac
tical ties and the remaining 69 are in counties which
have shown decided Hughes strength. Hughes' lead, with
these 346 precincts missing, is 510. Wilson has gained
thus far today. <1
ST. PAUL. Nov. 9.—The St. Paul Daily News, on ;
telephone and telegraphic returns from many missing pre
cincts, tabulates 169,810 votes for Wilson and 168,481 for
Hughes, a lead of 1,329 for Wilson in Minnesota. These
figures are not official but are from official sources.
ST. PAUL, Nov. 9. —Return* from 4* p reel net* In Beltrami eom

By Perry Arnold
NEW YORK, Nov. 9.—President Wilton
is within 10 votes of re-election. Charles E.
Hughes must gain 23 if he is to obtain a
majority.
This was the outstanding feature of the
progress of the count today at noon.
With 256 votes in the electoral college
indicated for the democratic candidate in
United Press returns, California alone—or
Minnesota alone—would be enough to make
Wilson the next president.
Hughes, on the other hand, must carry
both of these states.
As if further to drag out the agony
among politicians, California exhibited a
strong Wilson tendency and Minnesota a
strong Hughes drift.
Charges Exchanged
The situation today, therefore,
was one which pulled taut the al
ready overstrained nerves of po
litical managers.
It was responsible for more acri
monious exchanges between the
two sides than heretofore marked
the campaign. It brought warn
Ings from Democratic Chairman
McCormlck to his cohorts to
"guard ballot boxes" lest there be
tampering
It Inspired Republican Chairman
Willed bitterly to reply that any
one Intimating the theft of votes
by republicans was a "contemptible
scoundrel" and Issued a warning
against the stealing of the presi
dency by the democrats.
In at least one state —New
llamp*hlrr*p& recount and court
action nny be necessary to recon
cile flatly contradictory claims
from both sides based on complete
returns.
BULLETINS
BISMARCK. N. D„ Nov. 9.—North Dakota may be placed definite
ly In the Wilson column today, 1,817 out of 1,859 precincts giving Wil
ton 50,819, Hughes 49,972. The remaining 42 precincts are sparsely
populated, and democrats claim their entire registered vote could not
overcome the 747 lead Wilson maintains.
NEW YORK. Nov. 9.—The republicans claim California now by
only 500. A telegram from State Chairman Chester H. Rowell, at re
publican headquarters, at 3:45, made this claim.
A3BURY PARK, Nov. 9.—Senator Hollis of New Hampshire
wired President Wilson today that Wilson's "bedrock plurality" In that
state will be 100.
SANTA FE. N. M„ Nov. 9.— Returns at 9:30 a. m., tabulated from
delayed received at both . democratic and republican stat*
headquarters upset all previous calaulatlons on the New Mexico elec
toral vote. Hughes electors are now leading by a plurality of 258.
These figures aae from 336 out of H3B precincts In the state, and show
the following vote: Hughes 14,794, Wilson 14,536.
