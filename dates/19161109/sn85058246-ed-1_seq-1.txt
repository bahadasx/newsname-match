Utah Makes a Complete Reversal of
Her Former Political Standing
King Will Replace Sutherland in the
Senate and Bamberger Is Elected
Governor
id
It
Woodrow Wilson was re-elected
president of tho United States in
Tuesday's election. Ho got oVer. on
a bare margin of electoral voles,
The nation was In doubt until last
evening when it was conceded that
Minnesota and California were both
safe within thcWllson coluhins.
In Utah, too, the Democrals'shoW-,
ed that they were real politician's
and elected William H. King to the
U. S. Senato and Simon Bemberger
as Utah's next governor.
The Vote Is estimated to be about
15000 majority In tho stato for Wil
son, about 12,000 majority for "King
and about 10,000 for Bamberger.
Mtltdn H. Welling and Jamos II.
Mays, 'Democrats, have been elected
to congress.
Both houses of the stato legisla
ture will be Democratic.
Salt Lake county has gone Demo
cratic by about 5000 plurality and
overy man on the county and legis
lative ticket have been elected.
Weber county has been carried by
tho landslide into tho Democratic
column with from 2000 to 4000 plur
ality for every man on tho ticket.
So complete was the victory that
tho Democrats carried almost every
county In the state, not only for the
stato olllcers, but also for their local
officers.
Simon Bamberger, -the governor
elect, has tho distinction of being
the first Democratic and tho first
non-Mormon governor of Utah. Ho
Is a prominent Salt Lake capitalist.
Ills sweeping victory came as a dis
tinct surprise even to his staunchest
supporters. It was generally sup
posed that ho would run far behind
Wilson.
Cacho county still remains In tho
Democratic column. A. A. Law who
was pitted against Judge J. D. Call
was given a big majority In most of
tho county precincts but from tho
returns it appears that Call won by
a big voto In Box Elder county.
Fellow Republicans, it now begins
to look' like tho Democrats knew
what they were talking about when
they said this Is a Democratic year.
Wo will have to get together as Am
erican citizens and work for a bigger
and better United States, for a big
ger and better Utah, for a bigger and
bettor Cache county and for a bigger
and better Logan.
Upstate Counties In New York lloll
. , Up Old-Fnshloned
Majorities.
New York, Nov. 7. Tho Republi
cans made a clean sweep of New
York stato, with Governor Whitman
runlng ahead of Hughes and William
Calder, United States senatorial can
didate, far ahead of his running
mates.
From Incorporate returns tho fol
lowing pluralities aro estimated:
Hughes-over Wilson 100,000.
Whitman over Seabury, 200,000.
Calder over McCombs; 220,000.
Tho upstate countlos rolled up tho
old-fashioned Republican majorities,
apparently forgetting the dark days
of 1912 and tho rift In tho party
ranks.
In Now York City Wilson fell far
behind tho expectations of his cam
paign managors and othor Democrat
ic leaders. Tho indications from in
complete returns aro that he will
carry tho city by 40,000. Brooklyn
gives 0,000 of this plurality. Queens
Is in doubt, though tho Ilopubllcan
campaign managers claim a chance
of winning, Tho other counties of
tho city, Now York, Bronx and Rich
mond wore carrlod by Wilson.
Judge Seabury ran behind his
ticket In the city. Though rrosldont
"Wilson carried Brooklyn by, approx-
I imately 60,000. Whitman' carried
k th.couaty.JjuwBvt!3.lniflllcei.9000.
peabury's plurality In tho cntlro city
will bo in tho neglhborhood of 20,
fiOO. I Wilson made big gains In tho Re
publican districts of Now York, but
his votes In the Democratic districts
flumped.
Albany county, tho domain of Boss
Barnes, tho foo of Hughes since tho
oa)s whon Hughes as Governor made
ills fight against race track gamblers,
rolled up the splendid plurality for
.the Republican 'candidates. Krlo
'bounty also gave Hughes an estimat
ed plurality of 10,000. In their pre
election estimate the Republican
campaign managors had conceded
Brie to Wilson by 5000.

LOWER HOUSE PROBABLY I
REPUBLICAN 1
iJjB
HcAiot RojireVontaftv'oss will pre
sumably be Republican. Tho Indic
ations as this edition went to press
wero that the Republicans will have
a majority of ten. Tho senato will
presumably bo Democratic, although
as this was written sovornl of tho
states, which might decide tho sena
torial situation had not been definit
ely heard from. Tho best Inferences
to bo mnde from tho retturns avail
able at midnight was that tho Senato
would bo Democratic by a single
vote.
Governor Whitman Is re-elected
by nn overwhelming voto. William
Calder, Ilopubllcan, has been re-elected
United States, sonator. Now York
county's estimated plurality for tho
PreSldont was ono of tho smallest In
Tammany's history. It was about
28,000. The same' majority was
given to Samuel Seabury, nominee
for governor on the Democratic tick
et. Full of Surprises. , N
The election was filled with sur
prises, somo of them most startling
In charactor. The Democrats were
lifted to a sort of seventh heaven
of delight early In the night whon
It was nnnouncod that Kansas, ono
of tho old Republican strongholds,
was In doubt and that tho Indications
pointed to tho President to carry It
The latest returns as this edition
went to press showed Mr. Hughes
leading thcro by nbout 3000. As
Kansas Is normally 50,000 to 60,000
' Republican this was somewhat sur
prising to tho Republicans. It was
merely ono of tho unexiuainablo fea
tures of a remarkable election, which
brought to a climax tho most remark
nblo campaign of n generation
Interest was focused on Illinois.
That was olllclally sot down as the
stato upon which the national con
test would swing. With returns in
complete tho Indications nro that
Illinois will glvo Mr. Hughes a plur
ality or something 111(0 100,000.
Tho women furnished tho surprise
(to the Democrats) In this Btato
Thoro woro 600,000 of them at tho
polling, placos during tho day. Nono
would attempt to estimate how they
would cast their ballots. Tho Demo
crats conlldontly and sincerely pre
dicted that becauso of tho pacifist
lasuo the women would fairly storm
the polls for the President, but thoy
didn't. In somo soctlons they votod
ns tho womon In all other equal
franchise states have always voted,
with their husbands, brothers, and
othor male kin.
Ilusliu-Hs .Men for G. O. P.
Tho labor vote In somo of tho rail
way centers of Illinois caused a de
fection in tho normal Republican
voto, but tho swing of business mon
to tho Republican ticket mado up
for this defection and tho stato re
tained Its place In tho columns whero
It always stood until four years ago,
