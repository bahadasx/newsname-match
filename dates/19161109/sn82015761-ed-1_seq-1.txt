MOST MOMENTOUS
ELECTIONS 50 YEARS
The most momentous election
in 50 years passed quietly in Wil
liams. The day dawned with a
cold raw breeze blowing and the
promise, later fulfilled, was for
a cold day. The election board
was ready to receive votes at the
time fixed by law and in the first
precinct Dick Connors asked for
and received a ballot at 8, In
the second ward the first to call
for a ballot was S. S. Stark at
6:15. From that time on until
noon voting was fitful and only a
total of 87 in the first precinct
and 81 in the second precinct
had been cast at 11:30.
By one o'clock the vote had
climbed to 126 in the first pre
cinct and to 109 in the second
precinct. Voting picked up quite
rapidly as the afternoon wore
off and at 3:30 the vote stood
200 for the first precinct and 223
for the second.
The gains of the second ward
over the first could be accounted
for by the number of automibles
busy carrying second precinct
voters to the polls while in the
first precinct the voters had to
walk and were longer in getting
to the polls, if they went at all.
The next hour added 24 votes to
the poll in the first precinct and
48 votes to the poll in the second
precinct.
At this time election officers
and voters were asking eagerly
for news from the general elec
tion. However, scarcely any
thing had been received from
the east and nothing which would
give a line on the result. Small
towns in Massachusetts were re
ported thru their poll and the
count underway. The count as
far as it had gone was decidedly
in f avor;of Hughes for president.
The last voter in the first pre
cinct, W. G. Ellison, cast his bal
lot at 5:50 and in the second pre
cinct Daniel McLean completed
the polling at 5:45.
Electors in Williams last Tues
day were good natured and or
derly thruout. Of course the
boot-legger plied his nefarious
business and there was some
drunkenness but no disorder.
Those who were loaded with
booze wandered away, mainly,
to have a lonesome "good time."
A few there were to taint the
air with their foul breaths, but
otherwise they did not make
themselves obnoxious. When
the polls closed at 6 o'clock Wil
liams could enjoy the satisfaction
of having held an election at
which the women voters were
very welcome and very court
eously treated.
Motor Cycle Race On, 7 Start
Several . motor-cyclists went
over the road from Springerville
to Phoenix a few days ago to
try out the road preparatory to
participating in the race from
Springerville to Phoenix which
was to start and did start Nov.
9. ..The cyclists were to relay at
Flagstaff Thursday evening and
make the next run thru to Phoe
nix. At 8:30 to. 9:00 Friday
morning the motors passed thru
Williams on the way to Phoenix
All seemed to be in good condi-
' tion and were clipping along at
' a good gait.
Cannon-ball Davis, the noted
is one of the contestants. When
the motor-cycles passed thru
Williams a Flagstaff participant
was in the lead. The motor
cycles are averaging better than
, 40 miles an hour.
Mrs. Louise Field want to Flag
staff Monday for a few days.
BOOT-LEG WHISKEY
CAUSEDJIS DEATH
John McLaughlin a lumber-jack
of the Saginaw camps came into
Williams the middle of last week
with a roll of about $225 and be
gan the gay life. He placed some
of his mouey on election wagers
but more of it went to boot-leggers
for their vile fluid. Sunday he was
seen helplessly drunk and while
in that condition a Mexican was
seen to go through his pockets and
take his watch. Wednesday morn
ing McLaughlin was found dead in
bed at Charley Bonner's house. A
coroners jury was summoned by
Judge Twitty and it rendered a
verdict that the deceased came to
his death thru natural causes; from
which it probably may be inferred
that it is perfectly natural for boot
leg whiskey to cause' desth.
To Give Mexican Supper
The Ladies of the Catholic church
will give a Mexican supper of Tama
les Enchiladas, etc., in the Williams
Opera House Saturday evening
The supper will be served at 5
o'clock. All are cordially invited.
SANTA FE DOING GOOD '
WORK ON SEGONO STREET
The work of opening Second
Street across the Santa Fe tracks is
moving Blowly, but the railroad
company is very thoro and when
the work is completed the street
across the tracks will be in fine
shape. The tracks have been sur
faced with cinders and the approach
on the north side is being made
entirely of cinders. , The roadway
north to the north side of the right
of way has been graded and this
will be surfaced with cinders. The
drainage of the yards will be taken
care of by two box culverts, one
on the north side of the tracks and
the other on the south side but
between tracks. In addition to
this fctreet work a pavement is to
be constructed at the east end of
the freight building and a concrete
sidewalk along the east side. The
street will be paved south to the
south side of the right of way.
When this work is all completed
there will be a general realization
that no mistake has been made in
crossing the tracks on Second
Street. The crossing as construct
ed will be both convenient and saft
and will add much to the good
appearance of the Town.

Arizona voters arenas -intelligent
as any in the -nation but ..quit a
number failed to rota as they r in
tended and a considerable numbsr
teemed to bs afraid of ths amend
ments. And this suggests ths plan
mads use of earlier in the history
of the Australian ballot in our
country of holding schools of in
struction in the use of the ballot.
A few lessons would make all vot
ers competent to rcgisW their wills
with respect to the candidates and
propositions to bs voted on.

WIN IN FINALS
In one of the closest and most
sharply contested elections of
our history Woodrow Wilson the
democratic candidate for the
presidency seems to have won.
The early returns were from the
eastern states and they pointed
to a landslide for Mr. Hughes.
As states further west were
heard from it became evident
that there had been no landslide
tho it yet looked as if Mr. Hughes
was a sure winner. Succeeding
reports narrowed the margin be
tween the two candidates an!
finally the Wilson electors out
numbered the Hughes and when
the complete vote of California
was in Mr- Wilson had enough
electors to insure his election
and, if states still doubtful were
found to have given a democrate
majority, his vote would go well
toward the 300 mark 266 being
necessary to elect.
Hunt Also Wins
In Arizona a conflict was on
little less interesting than that
of the nation. The supporters
of, Tom Campbell heralded his
election as governor and the dem
ocrats were ready to concede
Hunt's defeat. Completer returns.-however,
gave democrats"
courage to hold up their heads
and hope for victory. The Camp
bell majority shrank gradually
and finally disappeared entirely
and a small Hunt majority took
its place. .1 he famous sombrero
had failed to elevate its owner to
the governorship. The" pictur
esque figureof Arizenf.'s - hand
somest "man had not - appealed
strongly enough to the, supposed
ly, susceptible hearts of Arizona's
women voters. . The pudgy little
man from Gila whose speech is
a very poor index of his deeds
had been vindicated not as
generously as he had hoped, but
still vindicated. . And Shake
speare's "He laughs best who
laughs last" was exemplified.
OWEN-BROWN
Mr. Bert Brown and Miss Mae
Owen were united in marriage last
Monday night at the home of Mrs.
Joe Thomas.- Justice of the Peace
F; O. Twitty officiating. Among
those present at the ceremony were
Mr. and Mrs. Foster, Mr. and Mrs.
Burnett and Mrs. Joe Thomas.
Mr. Brown is employed by the
Williams Transfer, and the young
people will make v their home in
Williams.
