, j Nev York, Nov. 9. Democratic Chairman McCormick
h at 4:50 o'clock issued the following statement:
j "We have got the thing sewed up. President Wilson is
!) re-elected beyond any shadow of a doubt."
'j San Francisco, Nov. 9. 5,569 precincts out of 5,870 in
3 California give Hughes 454,357; Wilson 455,246. Wilsons
,) plurality 889. The swing back to Wilson's favor was oc-
: casioned by rectifications made by county clerks in nine coun-
"1 ties in checking up unofficial returns.
.1 San Francisco, Nov. 9. Revision by the county regis-
I trars of voters in Los Angeles and San Francisco counties left
i Wilson a plurality of but 500 voters. These figures were based
I on 5,561 precincts out of 5,870 in California, giving Hughes
:, 453,972; Wilson 454,472.
i, San Francisco, Nov. 9. 5,676 precincts out of 5870
j give: Hughes, 458,154; Wilson, 460,075.
3 This was a jump of more than 1 ,000 for Wilson, most of
j which came from Siskiyou, a mountain county scarcely repre-
j sented in previous returns.
J - San Francisco, Nov. 9. At this
Hj 3 lime but nine precincts were yet to
jw fj be heard from in Los Angeles county,
j Hughes' greatest stronghold, while
:9 ; more than 200 precincts in northern
jH I California; expected-mostly to give-
8 ! Wilson pluralities, -were yet to report.
H These northern precincts are in iso-
V 1 lated mountain counties and nil may
IvM -l not be available beforo tomorrow.
m '
JVi I San Francisco, Nov. 9. Fife tbou-
Jfl I sand five hundred and thirty-one pre-
S ; cincts out of 5870 in California give
I Hughes 450,561, Wilson 453,123. Wil-
Jjnl I son's plurality, 2522.
U ?J This drop of about 500 votes' from
-3 the last previous tabulation was occa-
H jj Bioncd by the rectification of the Ala-
H meda county (Oakland) vote, the
H I county clerk announcing a correction
H !j in Hughes' favor of 492 votes.
mB I Registrar McAlecr of Los Angeles
)ral d. announced a rectification which gave
rje$ J Hughes a net gain of 1,930 and said he
rns would complete a recheck late today,
iaa "f He said he thought the present count
Sjn 5 accurate. Wilson gained 15 votes by
;Jve v Registrar Zemansky's recount in San
Jit 'I Francisco.
3lu! ' The Los Angeles figures are on 1,207
out precincts out of 1,215 in that county, j
fll A leaving but eight to be heard from
ml
there. Returns from isolated moun
tain counties, in northern California
expected to give Wilson pluralities,
were slow in coming in.

WASHINGTON '
Seattle, Wash., Nov. 9. President
Wilson's plurality in Washington
jumped above the 10,000 mark early
today when returns "wero received
from counties -which previously had
been meagerly reported and which
went strongly for the president. With
less than 500 precincts to be reported,
all widely scattered, President Wilson
was leading Mr. Hughes by a margin
of 10.74S votes with every indication
that complete returns would send his
plurality above 12,000.
Governor Ernest Lister, Democrat,
apparently will defeat Henry McBride,
Republican, for governor, by more
than 10,000 votes.
Senator Miles Poindexter. Republic
an, who was re-elected, will have the
largest plurality of any of the candi
dates on any ticket.

WAR PACE TOO
FAST FOR MEN
Next Year Allies Will Be Fac
ing Boys of 17 in Ger
man Army.
London, Nov. 9. (Correspondence
of tho Associated Press.) The war
threatens soon to become a struggle
between mere boys. The pace Is said
to be entirely too fast for the older
men long to endure.
It is declared here that next year
the entente allioB will be facing boys
of 17 in the German army.
General Sir Douglaa Haig, command
ing the British expeditionary forces, is
said to have objected to tho sending
out of men of middle age. He wants
young men of from IS to 25. After tho
latter year it is said the fighting value
of the human unit shows a rapid and
steady decline.
The good soldier of today It seems
must bo of the age which excels in
the more strenuous athletic games
the football player type. Tho older
men have their place, but generally
speaking It is said now to be in "the
army behind tho army" the men back
of the line, in the supply and trans
port divisions where the strain is not
so great. These older men are too
Eusceptiblo to trench diseases to be of
great use on the firing line.
England already is registering boys
born In 1899 preparatory to calling
them up when they attain thoir elgh
teenth year.
