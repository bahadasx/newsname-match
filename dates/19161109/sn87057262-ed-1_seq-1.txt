[By Perry Arnold, United Press Stall
Correspondents]
NEW YORK, NOT. 9.—The presi
dential fight Is still undecided.
At eight o'clock today neither Presi
dent Wilson nor Charles EL Hughes
had shown a sufficient number of elec
toral votes in the count of ballots so
f^r made to Insure election.
The United Press canvass at that
hour showed the democratic nominee
slightly in the lead, with 251 against
Hughes' 243. Thirty-seven electoral
votes were still In doubt—represent
ing the states of California. Minne
sota, New Mexico, North Dakota and
New Hampshire.
Wilson needed fifteen votes tor a
majority itughes 23.
California or Minnesota, plus any
one of the other doubtful states would
give the presidency to Wilson while
.tiughes, if he did not carry both Cali
fornia and Minnesota (which togeth
er would give him more than his
twenty-three votes) needed one of
these with all the others to obtain t^e
necessary 266.
The situation today, therefore, was
one which pulled taut the already
overstrained nerves of political man
agers. It was responsible for more
acrimlnous exchanges between the
two sides than heretofore marked the
campaign. It brought warnings from
Demicratic Chairman McCormlck to
bis cohorts to "guard ballot boxes" lest
there be tampering. It Inspired Re
publican Chairman Willcox bitterly to
reply that any one Intimating theft of
votes by republicans "was a contempt
ible scoundrel" and issued a warning
himself against the stealing of the
presidency by the democrats.
In at least one state—New Hamp
shire—a count and court action may
be necessary to reconcile flatly con
tradictory elaims from both sides,
based on complete returns. Reports
from West Virginia, credited to
Hughes on the face of incomplete re
turns, but claimed as democratic by
the Wilson supporters, indicated
tenseness of the partisans there might
result in some of the "shot-gun" activ
ity which marked the famous Hayes
Tilden presidential controversy of
1876—the political mixup most near
ly paralleling the present situation.
SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 9.—On re

beard from in California, will depend
whether Wilson or Chas. E. Hughes
carries California's electoral voto.
And on the votes of these same pre

chairman of California, stated that
the republicans claimed southern Cali

In fact, he is about the most calm
of all of those in the republican

NEW YORK, Nov. 9.—A divided
congress was forecast by incomplete
returns gathered by the United Press
up to noon today. These returns
tended to support republican claims
that the bouse will be republican, al
though democratio leaders insisted
the final count will show them still
in control of the lower body. That
the present democratic majority of
twenty-one will be deeply cut, how
ever, is certain.
Returns on the senate .fight are
nearer complete. They tended to
show the democrats still in control
there by a probable majority of twelve
compared to their present majority of
sixteen.
The entire membership of the house
was voted on. Estimates based on
claims of state committees of both
sides show anywhere from 210 to 220
democratic congressmen elected and
from 218 to 220 republicans chosen.
One of the big features of the con
gressional fight is the- seeming elec
