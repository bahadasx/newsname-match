Latest Returns Favor wi on
May Throw Victory to Democratic
Party With the Final Results
Wilson Has 232 Electoral Votes and Hughes 218,
With 81 Still in Doubtful Column-Early Re
publican Gains Seem Offset by Steady Trend of
Balloting in West and Upset of Estimates in
Many States Which Previously Had Been Con=
ceded to the Republicans.
New York, Nov. 8.-At 4:45 o'clock this morning the
returns, while still incomplete, made Wilson reasonably
certain of 232 votes in the electoral college and seemed to
give Hughes 218. There were 81 votes still in doubt, 266
being required for an election.
These states were counted for Wilson: Alabama, Ari
zona. Arkansas, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky,
Louisiana. Maryland, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Ne
braska, Nevada, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio,
Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah and
Virginia-Total, 232.
For Hughes these were claimed: Connecticut, Dela
ware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachussets, Michigan, New
Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania Rhode Island, South
Dakota, Vermont, Washington and Wyoming-Total 218.
At 515 a. m. returns from Cheyenne took Wyoming
from the Hughes list and placed its three electoral votes
in the doubtful column with Wilson leading.
These states were doubtful: California, Idaho, Indi
ana, Kansas, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Mexico,
Oregon, Washington and West Virginia-Total 81.
From the doubtful states the returns were coming in
slowly and there were indications that the full result
would not be known before noon. The chairmen of the
Republican and Democratic committees both claim victory
for their respective candidates.
The Republicans seemed to the
have the best prospects in In- tee
diana, Minnesota, Oregon and
West Virginia. In the other Ri
states listed as doubtful, except
California, the Democrats ap
peared to be leading.
At this hour the Republicans es
had not overcome the Democrat
ic majority in the House of Rep- in
resentatives or in the Senate.
With about 100 congressional hi
districts still to be heard from W
the Democrats bhad made a net 3j
gain of eight members in the tt
House, but late returns from A
New York indicated that two of S
these might be reversed.
With a net gain of eight it y
would leave the House with a
Democratic majority of seven.
In the Senate Democrats
showed losses from New York.
New Jersey and Maryland. The t
indications were they would
lose the two senators fron Indi
ana, one from West Virginia and
possibly one each in Ohio, Mon
tana and Arizoua. The Demo
crats, however gained senators
from Rhode Island, Deleware
and Utah. Conceding all the
probable Republican gains would
give a net Republican gain of
seven in the Senate and leave
the Democrtic majority at two.
Vance McCormick, chairman
of the national committee, gave
out the following statement at
5:20 this morning:
"President Wilson was re
elected yesterday by the people
people of the United States. He
will have certainly 304 votes in
the electorial college and this
may be increased by belated re
turns from doubtful states.
"The victory is emphasized by
the reluctance of the enemy to
admit defeat and is a complete
repudiation of the unfounded
r claius sent over the country by
the Republican national commit- Lu
tee last night."
Returns Indicate Victory In tit
Third for Whit Martin. ad
Ith
Returns from the eigh parish- in
es composing the Third congres
sional district Tuesday, night w,
indicated the re-election of Con- ca
gressman Whit P. Martin over th
his Democratic opponent, Sheriff st
Wade G. Martin, by a small ma- t,
jority. The returns showed tt
that Judge Whit Martin carried p
Assumption, Iberia, Lafourche,
St. Mary and Terrebonne, while
Wade Martin was ahead in Lafa
yette, St. Martin and Vermilion.
Only the most meager returns C
came ,in from Vermilion, and
supporters of Wade Martin
claimed that complete returns
from this parish would bring
their candidate's total up to or
ahead that of the Progressive
and Republican choice. o
Congressman Martion had a N
majority of about 400 on the
face of returns.
