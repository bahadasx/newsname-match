In Memoriam
Carey W. Hazel was born at
Three Springs, Kentucky, No
vember 20, 1872, died at Meade,
Kansas, November 6, 1916. Fun
eral services were held at the
Baptist Church November 8, un
der the auspices of the Independ
ent Order of Odd Fellows, of
wh'ch order the 'deceased was a
faithful member.
The beautiful and commodious-
church edifice was crowded
to its -utmost capacity by those
who came not through idla curi
osity, but by genuine frjends
'whose-hearts while fill.-a - with
grief beat jn sympathetic unison.
The casket reposed in the ves
tibule mid garlands of beautiful
flowers providsd by loving
friends and the various lodges
and clubs with which deceased
or his family had been identified.
As a token of respect business
was suspended and the public
schools closed.
For several years Carey Hazel
had resided in Meade, county,
and so just and upright had been
his life, so full of fellowship had
been his heart that the number
of his friends was limited only
by the circle of his acquaintance.
No word of reproach, no criti
cism of conduct was ever uttered
against him.
The writer knew him intimate
ly, and loved him well, as did all
who were fortunate enough to
share that intimacy. His was a
kindly, generous spirit that in
fluenced for good all with whom
he came in contact. His optim
ism, good cheer and loving fel
lowship were never changed by
circumstance, by environment or
by adversity. In sunshine he
was as tender as the flowers,
while in storm he was the
gnarled oak and adamantine
rock. Without nretension he
none the less possessed all the
virtues that go to make up the
'noblest of God's handiwork, and
no more fitting tribute could be
inscribed to his memory than,
"Here lies a man."
To his bereaved loved ones the

shrouds them the. stars that
shine beyond penetrate but
faintly; but time, and the heal
ing balm of friendly sympathy
will heal their lacerated hearts,
and the sad, sweet memory of
him will linger with them, the
lessons he has taught, the exam
ples he has wrought, the benign
influence of his noble life will go
with them always, and in the
silent watches of the night they
will be comforted by his hover
ing spirit. P. S: S.

Find Out for Yourself
Getting money is not an easy
matter. It takes brains and
effort, and muscle and sweat and
toil to land a dollar. And every
man, earning his own dollar, has
a right to spend it as he sees fit.
That's his privilege a privilege
none dare deny. The great ques
tion is, how can the man who
owns a dollar spend that dollar
to the best advantage? How can
he get the most for his money ?
How-can he best use it for his
own good and for the good of his
own community? If you have a
dollar to spend, here is a plan
you might try out it might
help you to get honest value for
an honest dollar. Make out a
Hot of the things you wish to
buy. Go to your home dealer
and show him this list. Tell him
just how much money you wish
to spend. Have him to show you
the goods he carries. Examine
oath article carefully note the
mi:kes. the brands, the quality.
Ask the merchant any ouestions
you may wish to ask. Get him
to give you his prices. Talk the
matter over with him, heart to
heart just as you would talk
over any other matter with any
other friend. The home dealer
can not expect you to trade with
him unless he gives you honest
values for your money. He
hopes to get business on merit
only. But you can not well know
just what goods your home deal
er has in stock you can not
know the quality you. can not
Know the price he will make on
your bill, unless you go to him
direct. When it comes to spend
ing your own dollar, you should
make ycur own investigation.
You should see the goods that
are offered at home. You. can't
afford to take any chances on
overlooking a real bargain in a
local store. It isn't the business
of the man in the big city to tell
you how cheap you can buy
things in your own home town.
You must find that out for yourself.
