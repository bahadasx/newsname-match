Dear TJro. Garretti
Bro. Richardson- jreen free
reader or CRESSLT at last

fifty cents of Jane Adam-i wto
runs hull housa whore the Bro,
woi-ks no''.v mid then tell
ing f iirriners about books and
literatoor, Jane been en easy
street since Bro. Ford's peace
ship went nnd came and Bro.
Richardson i in pretty soft
now whenrho wants small bit of
change.
Delishtful time other evening
Bro Garrett, we orcanizsd a
CRESSET Club and had mpet
ing Bro. Gordwin nrr Bro.
Richardson and ree we sat down
and had heart searching talk
about creation and formation
and Hun Caudle and It ho other j
folks of . Caudle Grove. Bro.
Richardson H strong for you
Bro, Garrett He got happy at
meeting said halliluia That was
.when he said ho would borrow
fifty cents of iine which he did
and here it is for you Bro.
Garrett.
Folks say on sly that the bro.
is a swede others he is a do I
dont believe it but I have heard
him talk mighty like both of
them kind of furriners.
Sister Olson she is on mourn
ers bench today Bro, Garrett, I
am full of gloom her spirit is
quaking in temiio&t of renent-
ance She is good sister after all
she means to do right and says
she longs for two man theory to
to straighten ber out. She gaye
me the two bits and I am send
ing thfra to you for dear
CRESSET.
Tho sister is great for the
eats though, sho likes green
peppers and far be it from her
to slight a meal for any social
engagements "Eats first and
business later" says she and
banged up the receiver.' Sister
Lowis says if Helen ever mar
ries the rest of the family will
be able to live In big fine house
on the drive as it is grocery bill
eats up tbe income Tbey say
tiro, Horace goes bungy half
the time because Sister Helen
reaches over and takes his eats
at table Shame to tbe sister.
I have great honor Bro.
Garrett to introduce a nother
dessiple of dear Chesset al
though I aint met her myself
yet she is dear friend of Olsans
Mrs Alette Johnson. She read
CRESSET other day and felt
great thrill of joy and mirth sent
me two bits eaid tell Bro, Gar
ret this is last cent between me
and arvation but I rather
starve then be without love and
the three links of quadrant of
oddfellows as shown by dear
CRESSET. Give mo the quad
rant or give me death says she,
Sister says creation and for
mation are beautiful words and
two man theory is great There

onnldnt be two woman theory
fays bor, bfcaue two woman is
like t'vo cats who fight nn
back fence at midnight Men ,are
full of love and all tlv; mysteries
of tbe quadrant nnd friendship
andsotwo man' theory 1: pos
sible and great postulate for hc
evolution of a duli.it.ip philosophy
as old bili James might have
said.
Sister Johnson and Bro
Ilornoe arcnt peaceful they la
a! ways at odds about something
or other T dont know what, hut
they is agreed tha' president
Wi'son should lip reelected
president bro, Horace is tnnto!
Wng anyway. If you was to
mf Pt him Bro, Garrett he wnld
look vt non yon not as an indivi
dnal with n nersonalHv but as a
mathematical nrnnosltinn with
quadmnts nnd tripods nnd cubs
and triangles and p.nbfl rnts and
fourth dimensions, that's the
kind of sinner Bro. Horace is, I
aint much use for him butt wp
is always peaceful like when we
meet.
Bro, Goodwin greatly chpered
it what I said ahoufc him he ia
boy with sweet dlspolsh and
nice ma who I liko but he dont
treat her good He makes her
work at office too much but that
aint nnno of my business so I
jtiRt keep quiet and Ipao him
alone yet' we never qu.irrol any
Ah this is a beautiful world bro,
Garrett, its cot a sphere, after
all its a quadrant I do believe
you said its flat I guess vou are
right If It wasent -flat I guess
the blood wr uld be rushing our
heads half of the time 'when we
was on under side wouldnt H?
Sister Olson wonts you to
explain why you think world is

Adorinly, E.B. Orr,
