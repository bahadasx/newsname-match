MAN LOSES $400.
A man in Butte, Montana, lost $400
by hoarding his savings for eight
years. He called it "panic money"
and said he had carried it sewed up
in his pocket since 1907. After nu
merous robberies had taken place in
his community he decided to deposit
it in one of the banks in Butte, and
nearly fainted when the teller in the
bank told him the $820 he cut from
his hip pocket would have netted him
$400 more in interest had it been de
posited in the bank and figured at the
current rate.
Where are your treasures stored?
You may succeed in concealing your
money from the thief by sewing it up
in some pocket or hiding it some other
place, but still you are the loser by not
having your money in our strong bank,
where it will work for you and earn
that ever-welcome interest.
Come in and let us tell you about
our popular certificates of deposit
which earn four per cent for you from
the day you deposit.

DEATH OF MRS. JOHN KOHL.
On Friday night, November 3rd,
191C, Mrs. John Kohl passed away at
her home on Sixth street, Perrysburg,
Ohio. Her death was due in part to
weakness caused by more than four
years of suffering from the hardening
of the arteries and in part from a se
vere cold contracted last week, which
rapidly developed into pneumonia.
Mrs. Kohl's maiden name was Caro
line Lydia Davenport, being the young
est daughter of David and Kczia Dav
enport. She was born near Monroo
ville, Huron county, Ohio, August 27th,
1847. In 1852 her parents moved to a
farm situated about three and one-half
miles south of Perrysburg, and from
this date until seven years ago, she
lived in the neighborhood of the old
homestead. After teaching in the
country schools for two years, she was
married October 16th, 1872, to Mr.
John Kohl. Four children were bowi
to this union. Edward Alta, Clayton
Charles, Mcltha Estella and Earl
Byron, two of whom survive their
parents Clayton C, who lives in New
York, and Meltha E., who has ro
mained with and cared for them in
their last days. A daughter-in-law,
Mrs. Margaret W. Kohl, and two
grandsons live in New York. Mrs.
Conrad Kohl, who resides south of
town, is a sister of the deceased and
tho only remaining member of her
family. Upon the death of her hus
band in 1909, she and her daughter
moved to their present home on Sixth
street.
Mrs. Kohl was a life-long member of
the Methodist Episcopal church, having
formally united with this charge at
the age of 16. In all the hardships of
farm life, as well as in the cares of
rearing a family, she was a tireless
worker and always patient and self
denying. In her last years of almost
ceaseless suffering, she was equally
patient and thoughtful of others. As
a legacy to her family and friends, she
leaves the simple record of earnest toil
and Christian well-doing.
The funeral services were held on
Inst Monday at the Methodist church,

Capt. Greenhalgh Writes Interest

Soldier Life.
fc
Yslctn, Texas
(Mexican border),
October 30, 1916.
My Dear Blue :
1 havo been a long time writing
because we have been a long time
getting where there has been some
thing to write about. About all
thero was in Columbus was heat
and X guess you had plenty oi" that
in Perrysburg. Then after we got
down to Fort Bliss, El Paso, we
were issued a lot of wild, unbroken
horses and it has taken us almost
two months to tamo them suffi
ciently for real service on the bor
der. But here we finally are, 2
wagons, 8 mules, 80 horses and 80
men, the latter with 90 rounds of
rifle ammunition in their cartridge
belts and 21 rounds of 45 auto
matic revolver ammunition in their
magazine- holders. As I sit in my
tent writing this 1 am much nearer
the ltio Grande than I am to the
Maumee from my house in Perrys
burg and incidentally let me say
that tho so-called silvery Rio
Grande is not to bo compared to
the melliliuent Maumee. "We are
patrolling a stretch of about 151
miles, paying particular attention
to six different lords. Our legal
mission is the preservation of neu
trality which those on the other
side care as much about as the late
Taxpayer's committee did the
bond issue. By the way, before 1
came here I was at Canutillo where
our principal business was guard
ing two school houses and eight
teachers therein, for down here
there is a teacherage for each
school just as our parsonage for
a church. So you can tell tho
Board 1 am still in touch with edu
cation. What most surprised me,
however, was tho fact that the
minimum salary paid these girls is
$80.00 per mouth which shames
Perrysburg civilization consider
ably. Maybe teaching in that new
school house of ours though, will
be worth 20 or 30 dollars differ
ence.
We all find this a verv wonder
ful c ountry this morning there
was ice in our wash basins at
noon it is 90 degrees. It is clear
and dry and beautiful. Thanks to
irrigation there is a very fertile
valley about a milo wido with mes-
quite and sage and cactus beyond
mat on our siuo and on the other
the Mexican desert with the Sierra
Madras in the distance. The col
oring is glorious and each day dif
ferent. When not hunting Mexi
cans with rifle and revolver we aro
using our shot guns for quail and
duck, which aro very plentiful,
while the real sport is chasing jack
rabbits on liorsebaclc and trvniL' to
shoot them with a revolver.
1 ou may be interested to know
that Mrs. Greenhalgh has just
joined us and is securely at home
at Loma Tiva ranch which is
about two miles back from the
river and we are enjoying our
horses just as much as though we
were riding around Perrysburg.
No one seems to know yet what
it is ail about and when we urn
going home, yet when you talk to
the refugees here and realize the
insults, rape, murder and destruc
tion of American men, women and
property you wonder whether we
aro much of a nation after all. I
sometimes think if it was the Can
adian border and Toledo that was
bearing the brunt of bandit raids
and all sorts 'of outrages if we
would think much of Texas if she
and her citizens were utterly in
different. Please give my best to all at
home and take good care of my
boy and his dogs.
Sincerely yours,
Georgo P.Grcenhalgh,
Capt. Ohio Cavalry.

Somo Hallowe'en Pranks of Forty
Years Ago.
The latter part of October was
always welcomed by tho average
small boy in our village in the late
seventies, for it brought with it
Hallowe'en, the one day, or rather
night, set apart by common con
sent in years past for the perpe
tration of mischevious pranks.
And duriifg some of the years when
tne writer was a boy, there was
some pranks, mischevious and oth
erwise, perpetrated in Perrysburg,
as no doubt some of the readers
of the Journal will remember. And
though nearly everything that was
done was in a spirit of fun, yet
sometimes the boys got a trifle
reckless, and their pranks proved
to be rather annoying and expen
sive to those on whom they were
perpetrated.
Early in. the evening of tho day
on which Hallowe'en fell, the boys
would gather in groups and con
fide in each other as to the bet and
most available places to proceed to
in order to elevate into the air
what still remained of the cabbage
crop, and the good sized cabbage
patches in and near the village in
those years were not a few. Some
times some of the owners of these
patches were wise in that they an
ticipated a visit from the boys and
removed their cabbage, leaving
only the stumps in the ground. In
such instances tho boys would re
move the stumps and carry them
triumphantly up town and deposit
them with more force than polite
ness on the front porches of our
most highly respected and order
loving citizens After the "cab
bage drill" would come tho re
moval and interchange of front
yard gates. Some of the boys were
very adept at this exercise, and
could noiselessly remove a gate
and be a whole square away with
it in almost the twinkling of an
eye. On the morning after, gates
belonging to some of the most
lowly could be found in high
places, for instance, up in the
branches of a tree, while gates be
longing to some of the most highly
could not be found at all. After
the regular "gate exercises" came
the regular annual elevation of the
boxes. This consisted in gather
ing up all the empty dry goods
boxes, packing cases, and barrels
from the rear of the several stores,
carrying them to the street, and
piling them on tho tops of the
porches over the sidewalks in front
of.some of the stores. Some of the
boys exhibited an unusual amount
of energy and muscle in this exer
cise, and these same boys would
raise an awful howl when asked by
their dear old dads to take a few
rounds with a saw and sawbuek on
the family wood pile. That, you
know, was work.
Generally the next order of busi
ness was the annual interchange of
signs, and the boys usually entered
into this exercise with ghoulish
gieo and fiendish delight, and when
they got through the job was
usually a complete one. And the
dexterity with which they would
remove a largo Grasser & Brand
larger beer sign from the front of
George Wittmans saloon and se
curely attach it to the front of a
small law office a little further up
the street, was simply marvelous.
The lawyer's sign would go to the
front of a harness shop; the milli
nery sign to the front of a saloon ;
the undertaker s sign to a doctor s
office; the barber poles to the
butcher shops, and tho butchers'
signs to tho barber shops; the
shoemakers' sign to tho drug
store j the harness makers' sign to
tho dry goods store; the doctors'
sign to the millinery shop.; the dry
goods signs to the bake shop; the
hardware signs to the saloons,
etc., etc. And tho celerity with
which somo of thoso boys could
climb up tho fronts of stores and
removo tho signs without making
any disturbance whatsoever causes
mo to think of what a wonderful
success thoy would havo made as
"porch climbers had they stuck
to this climbing business. Well,
Louisiana avenuo usually present
ed a rather grotesque appearance
on the morning aftcrtho boys had
completed their night's frolic with
tho signs. Sometimes tho hoys
would bo compelled to restore
somo of these signs to their right

Items Concerning Various Depart
ments of tho Public Schools
The return game with Scott was
scheduled for hist Saturday as a
forerunner to tho Scott-Erie game.
But owing to the wet condition of
the field, the game was postponed
until some futuro date. It was
also feared that the game of soccer
would spoil the field for the more
important game.
The return game with Cygnet is
booked for Friday and the team
hopes for another victory.
The Phi-Sigma Literary Society
gave their first program on last
Friday. The eighth grade was in
vited to be present and everyone
expressed their appreciation of
the excellent numbers.
There is much rivalry between
the two societies, as to which can
give the best program. At the end
of the year an Intcr-Sociefy con
test will be held to determine
which society will cany off the
honors.
