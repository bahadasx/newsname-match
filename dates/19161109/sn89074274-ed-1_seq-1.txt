Republicans Say Hughes Has 284
New York, Nov. 7.—Soon after mid
night the republican national com
mittee in an official statement claimed
California, Connecticut, Deleware,
Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Maine,
Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan,
New Hampshire, New Jersey, New
York, North Dakota, Oregon, Pennsyl
vania, Rhode Island, South Dakota,
Vermont, Washington, West Virginia
and Wisconsiiu
That made I total of 284 (electoral
votes, 18 more than the necessary 265
for election.
This was the first official indication
from the republican headquarters that
the result would be so close.
Spots in Career of Hughes,
President Elect of the U. S.
Charles Evans Hughes was born in
Glens Falls, N. Y., April 11, 1862, the
son of a Welsh preacher, Rev. David
Charles Hughes and Catherine Con
nelly Hughes. His early boyhood was
spent in central New York state, where
he entered school at Oswego in 1868,
continuing his studies in Newark, N.
J., after the family moved there, and
later in New York city.
At 14 he entered Colgate university,
and two years yater went into Brown
as a sophomore, being graduated in
1881, at 19, and being chosen to deliver
the class oration because of his high
scholarship. In Brown he had been a
Phi Beta Kappa, a member of the
Brunonian editorial staff, and winner
of the Dunn premium for highest
standing in English literature.
Hughes immediately began teaching
Greek and mathematics in Deleware
academy, Delhi, N. Y., studying law at
the same time in Judge Gibson's office.
The same year he resigned at teacher
to enter Columbia law school, and be
came an attache of the office of Gen.
Stewart L. Woodford, United States
.district attorney. He was graduated
from the law school and admitted to
the bar in 1884, and in 1887 became a
member of the law firm of Carter,
In 1891, Hughes' health failing, he
quit practicing, and became a pro-'
fessor of law in Cornell. In 1893 he re
sumed the law practice, .the firm be
ing Carter, Hughes & Dwight, and
from then until 1900 he acted as spec
ial lecturer in New York law school.
In 1905 Hughes was appointed spec
ial consul for two investigating bod
ies before the New York legislature—
the Stevens gas and electric light com
mittee, and the Armstrong insurance
committee. He became nationally fam
ous for his conduct of the insurance
investigation, and in 1905 was nom
inated by the republicans for mayor
of New York, but declined the nomina
tion. In 1906 and again in 1908 he was
elected governor of New York, which
office he resigned in October, 1910, to
accept President Taft's appointment as
justice of the supreme court. He re
signed the justiceship last June, fol
lowing his nomination as the republi
can presidential candidate.

DISTRICT JUDGE POLLOCK LOSES
Fargo, Nov. 8.—A. T. Cole's victory
in Fargo over Judge Chas. A. Pollock
in the contest for district judge was
the surprise of the election here. That
Cole was going to win out in the dis
trict was generally conceded by close
observers of the trend of the cam
paign but that he would carry the city
was hardly believed by anyone. Cole's
majority of 508 in the ten precincts in
the city was the feature of the returns
last evening. Pollock got, in 43 of 68
Cass county precincts, 2,081 to 2,436
for Cole.

ernor, by more than 100,000.
SOUTH DAKOTA REPUBLICAN
Sioux Falls, S. D., Nov. 7.—More
than one-tenth of the precincts in the
state indicate Hughes has carried
South Dakota by 15,000. The prohibi
tion amendment was adopted by 20,
000 and the suffrage amendment by
10,000.

GOVERNOR CF MINNESOTA
St. Paul, Nov. 7.—J. A. A. Burn
quist, republican, was re-elected gov
ernor of Minnesota today by a decisive
plurality, returns shortly before mid
night indicated. Ninety-seven prfe
cincts, principally in Duluth and Min
neapolis, gave Wilson 13,654 Hughes
12,026. Duluth's complete was was
Wilson, 6,685 Hughes, 6,089.
NEBRASKA VOTES
FOR PROHIBITION
Omaha, Neb. 7. Scattering re
turns of the state and incomplete re
turns from Omaha indicate the pro
hibitory amendment carried in the
state by a small majority.
The second surprise locally last
night as the returns came in was that
republican Cass county should roll up
a majority for President Wilson. From
47 precincts heard from at the time of
going to press, Wilson led in Cass
county with 2,468 votes.
Pasteur Treatment Is
Given in Valley City
An item in Monday's Times-Record,
credited to the Litchville Bulletin,
stated that Ole Vaarum was in a
Grand Forks hospital, suffering from
lockjaw or hydrophobia, due to the bite
of a boar. The item was all right, ex
cept in the important point that he is
being cared for at the Valley City Gen
eral hospital, Dr. Platou being in
charge of the case. He is suffering
from hydrophobia, and his condition
has been serious, but Dr. Platou has
given him several installments of the
Pasteur treatment and believes that
he will recover.

CONGRESSMAN GEORGE M. YOUNG

by Pach Bros.
Returns from Barnes county, the
second congressional district and the
state show that Senator McCumber
and Congressman George M. Young
will be re-elected by handsome ma
jorities. McCumber leads Burke by
substantial figures throughout the
state, the ex-governor running consid
erably below the vote cast for Presi
dent Wilson. Young is showing his
normal strength with unofficial returns
giving him a vote of nearly three to
one. There is no question of the re
election of both candidates, the only
question being the size of their ma
jorities.
BOOTLEGGERS NABBED
Two booze dispensers appeared be
fore Judge Moe Monday, having been
rounded up by the police. Samuel
Salomon, an Indian, entered a plea of

Anderson Says Equity
Business Is Wonderful
St, Paul, Nov. 6.—"The Equity Co
operative Exchange is doing a wonder
ful business, but lack of capital is ser
iously handicapping our expansion,"
says President J. M. Anderson, of the
exchange.
"At the present time we are credit
ors to banks for $1,250,000. To be able
to borrow this amount of money, we
consider, is a tribute to our organiza
tion. During the past few months we
have sold $200,000 worth of stock. And
still we have not sufficient money."
Members of the exchange from Mon
tana will visit St. Paul this week to
urge the directors to make the ex
change a buying as well as selling
agency. They are anxious to purchase
farm machinery, particularly by the
co-operative method.
Mr. Anderson said a purchasing
agency was impossible until more capi
tal was available. The financing of the
huge movement of grain to market has
necessitated an unexpected sum.
"Our grain business," he continued,
"has surpassed our wildest dreams."

SENATOR POP.TE1 MsClTMBER

ESTABLISHED 1879
More than 16,000,000 American citi
zens went to the polls Tuesday to cast
their votes in the 29th general election
of the United States. This number
constitutes the largest electorate in
the world, and it was the mission of
this body to determine whether the
democratic administration should be
continued or turned back to republi

The line weather prevailing over the
country and the issues of the contest
brought out a record vote in regard to
numbers. The votiing everywhere
started early and continued heavy.
In Illinois where the women could
vote for president, one-eighth of the
nation's vote was centered, the total
being 1,300,000.
The vote as reported from the states
constituting the "solid south," indicate
that the vote was about normal and
that he result was the usual demo
cratic majority.
The big central states where the de
cision was expected to be close, and
also New York, are apparently safe
for Charles Evans Hughes.
Some of the features of this extra
ordinary election were:
To Be Elected
President and vice president.
Thirty-three United States senators.
Thirty-five governors.
Four hundred thirty-six representa
tives.
Complete state ticket in nearly ev
ery state.
