NEW TORK. Nor. 9. In tho first
hour of trading on the curb market
this morning more than $50,000 was
bet at varying odds on the election
outcome.
The first bets of the morning favor
ed Wilson at odds of 3 to 1. As later
news, particularly that from Cali
fornia appeared to favor Mr. Hughes,
the odds tightened, and at 11 o'clock,
they were quoted at 10 to 7 offered
and' 6 to 10 asked, both favoring the
re-election ' of the President. , ,
Thd varying odds and the' thousands
of dollar's on the curb to be wagered
caused a boiling market. Mora than
200 men were acting as betting com
missioners,! and the ring, that before
the election Was a c6mpara,tvejy
small one, has more than doubled In
slse. The election wagering was to
wild that very little trading In stocks
was reported.
, The largest Individual bet of the morn

Hughes, placed by brokers representing
a stock exchange house, SThere was i
large amount, of HuKheamoney thst
clamored for more of this 2 to 1, but It
came forward too readily for the Wilson
brokers and the odds were slowly but
surely hammered down. r
News in the morning papers that con
tests are very probable no matter who
wins on the face of the returns only
added to the Interest and excitement on
the curb market.
Practically all of the up-town brokers
were down on the curb market thU

anxious to bet tho bales of money that

On Election Service
To the Editor of The Times.
Sir: Tho Times has demon
strated again to the people of
Washington, by its superb
service in giving out the elec
tion returns, its superiority to
anything in the nature of a
real newspaper in the Nation's
Capital. It is a paper of the
people, for the people, and de
serves full and proper support
at the hands of tho people.
It is but just that this should
be said, and as ono Washing
ton business man, I give voice
to my sentiments, and sincerely
thank you.

Washington, D. C, Nov. 8.
WILSON'S MARGIN IN
NEWHAMPSHIRE100
' NEW YORK, Nov. 9.-With both sides refusing
to concede victory for the other, and with everybody
at both headquarters making strenuous efforts to get
exact information in the two States, the Democrats
and Republicans at 2 o'clock this afternoon are fol
lowing, precinct by precinct, the count in California
and Minnesota, knowing that in those States the elec
tion of a President of the United States will be settled.
Woodrow Vilson will be the next President if he
wins California.
Charles E. Hughes must carry both California
and Minnesota to win. .
On the face of the returns at 2 o'clock Minnesota
apparently has gone Republican, but by the narrow-
. stf sort of plurality which the uncounted soldier vote
may wipe out.
California probably will settle the most exciting
Presidential contest since 1876.
WILSON STILL LEADS.
California leans toward Wilson. In the early
returns this morning, with 400 precincts missing, Wil
son led by more than 4,300 votes.
The missing'precincts were declared to be largely
Republican precincts, and this was evidenced when
the next report at 1 o'clock showed that with only
336 precincts missing, Wilson's plurality had been re
duced to 3,533. Wilson still was leading, however, by
more than ten votes to a precinct, and the political
sharps here were uncertain whether Hughes could
make such gains in the remaining precincts as to wipe
out this Wilson lead.
As matters stood at 1 o'clock Wilson had 260 votes
in the Electoral College. This was an increase of nine
votes over night, his gain being made up by the five
votes from North Dakota and the four votes from New
Hampshire. The latter State turned topsy turvy over
night, going from 161 for Hughes on the unofficial
count, to 93 for Wilson on the semi-official report
given out by the secretary of state of New Hampshire.
NORTH DAKOTA TO WILSON.
In North Dakota the overnight returns showed such a
sweep to Wilson that early this morning the State was trans
ferred to the Democratic column.
West Virginia and Oregon, which were counted last
night as doubtful, both showed up this morning with con
siderable gains for Hughes, such as to leave little room for
doubt that the Republicans had carried them.
New Mexico is very uncertain, with the indications
seeming to be, that Hughes will win. He had a small lead
at 1 o'clock.
Hughes with his 243 electoral votes can win without
CONCOHD, N. II., Nov. 9.-Edward J.
Bean, the Republican secretary of state,
said today:
"Tho official vote of New Hampshire
Is yet to bo received from sixty towns
of the State. Unofficial returns navo
been received from these mlsslnn
towns."
With the vote of the State completo

may upsot tho present figures. The
States voto might awing on the final
official reports from some village."
When the sixty towns are heard from,
New Hampshire's voto will bo complete,
as tho militiamen of the State now on
tho border did not voto. No provision
waa mado for permitting the guards
men to cast their ballots.
NEW YOIUC, Nov. 9. The tloher at
noon sent out the-following:
"The Republican secretary of state of
New Hampshire today officially notified
Republican headquarters that tho com
plete compilation of the votes of that
State gives New Hampshire to Wilson
by 93 votes. The Republican managers
Immediately transferred New Hamp
shire on their list of claimed States
from Hughes to the Wilson column."
Wilson can win without New Hampshire if he gets
California, or he could win without both New Hampshire
and North Dakota if he got both California and New Mexico.
RECOUNT SEEMS CERTAIN.
An exceedingly important development is the fact that
both sides are prepared already to demand a recount of the
vote in close States and districts. Such recounts may delay
the final result for weeks.
These recounts are not to be sought necessarily on the
ground that there was fraud. The mere suspicion of errors
