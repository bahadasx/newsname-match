CROP ESTIMATES
FAR TOO LOW
YIELD EXCEEDS 1,200,000 BOXES
Small Portion of Apples on the East Side
Remains in Orchards Community
Packing Boose a Success
By leaps and boanda the eatimatea of
Hood River'a banner 1916 auole croo
have jumped from 900,000 boxea, pre
harvest figures, to a total of over 1,
200.000 at the present time, and when
all the fruit ia finally under cover and
in storage plants the figures will prob
ably materially exceed this amount. In
numerous instances growers found that
they bad failed by 60 per cent to order
enough, boxes to take care of their
crops. On the East Side Aug. Paasch
estimated bia total yield at 15,000 box
es. When bia picking waa over be
found that be had close to 40.000 boxes
of fruit, and so the yield went, in a
lesser degree, over tbe entire bast
Side.
Never have Hood River apple grow
ers bad aucb obataclea to contend with
as this year. Simultaneously they were
struck by a shortage ol laborera and a
shortage of cars. 1 be story of how tbe
Hood River business men and students
of the high school assisted in savins
the crop needs no retelling.
With the increased demand for boxes
because of the unexpected tonnage the
box shortage waa made very acute. It
was reported by salea agency officials
that the milla bad plenty of recepta
cles on hand, but the car ahortage made
it impossible to get them here. Hun
dreds of growers visited the Apple
Growera Association and Fruit Grow
ers' Exchange warehouses praying and
begging for boxes. The situation, to a
great degree, baa now been relieved.
Many growers, however, picked their
fruit and placed it in heaps in. the
fields. Mrs. Roy Brock, of the East
Side, picked about 2,000 boxes, placing
the fruit in pyramids on the ground.
She says that she lost practically none
of her apples so bandied.
Several thousand boxes of fruit are
still unpicked and in fields on the East
Side. The fruit is practically all New
towns and Ben Davis. With leavea all
fallen, trees of Ben Davis on the Sears
& Porter place along the East Side
macadam present a pleasing picture.
Ihe trees are so loaded that the
branches are bent to touch the earth.
The fruit is well colored and the patch
of red can be seen for a long distance.
Despite the loaded branches, the ground
is a veritable carpet of apples.
Although some trouble was experi
enced at the beginning of the season,
before the crews of men and women
were properly organised, the East Side
community packing house, which haa
33 members, growers of the district, is
now runing smoothly, packing an aver
age ex approximteiy 2,uuu boxes every
24 hours. The plant, under the efficient
superintendence of Peter Mohr, Jr., is
running a night and day shift of pack
ers and sorters. A total of 75 men and
women are employed at the plant.
An example of the magnitude of the
crop is shown at this warehouse. The
grower members of the concern in the
early season estimated that they would
have approximately 100,000 boxea of
fruit. Mr. Mohr says that the 250
acres of orchard included in the com
munity system will pack out over
150,000 boxes of fruit.
G. S. Crego, official photographer for
the Portland Chamber of Commerce,
here Monday to secure typical apple
harvest scenes, was taken to the East
Side community packing house by E.
O. Blanchar. Mr. Crego also took pic
tures of the loaded Ben Davis trees on
the Sears & Porter place.
The problem conrfonting the growers
and sales agency officials now is that
of a shortage of refrigerstor cars. But
one car waa received here by all ship
pers last Saturday. Monday all con'
cerns received nine cars.
"We are only able to take care of
about six per cent of our business,"
says Wilmer Sieg, "and the situation is
becoming very critical, we have ap
pealed to the officials of the O.-W. R.
& N. Co. and the Pacific Fruit Express,
and we have their assurance that ev
erything in their power will be done to
relieve the situation, union racinc
officials, however, have told ua that
the railways lack the motive power to
relieve the congested condition of east
ern terminals."
Local apple sales officials beard that
two solid train loada of refrigerator
cars were moved lrom Washington
districts last week. This news resulted
in a telegram urging the railway men
to pay more attention toward relieving
the local situation.
PROMINENT EDUCATOR
ADDRESSES TEACHERS
(By Will Cass)
Tbe annual Parent-Teacher institute
was held Monday. Tuesday and Wed
nesday of last week at Hood River bigh
school building under tbe management
of County Superintendent of Schools
Gibson. With a great deal of careful
work and presevering correspondence.
Mr. Gibson obtained for bia headlinera
a number of tbe best educatora the
Northwest possesses. In addition, the
teachera and parents were given the
opportunity of hearing Mies Fox, of
the National Bureau oi Equation,
Washington. D. C. a woman whose ed
ucational researches are winning ber a
nationwide prominence.
Prof. Evenden, of the Oregon State
Normal, at Monmouth, was the first
speaker and be bandied hia subjects in
a manner at once masterly and pleas
ing. His final addresa on "Habit
Forme tion and Ita Instinctive Bases"
was particularly noteworthy. Habits
were cited as one of tba most potent
aida of a teacher, but he warned his
audience in these words, "Don't start
a habit you can't finish," meaning that
a child should not be naif equipped
with a number ol non-functioning bab
ita. In "Adolescence," wbicb he called
the period of the ideal, tba introspec
tive or tba storm and stress period.
Mr. Evenden made a strong appeal for
the iunior high school.
Dr. DeBusk, of tbe University of
Oregon, dealt with "Crises in tne
Growth of the Child" and "Preventive
Mental Hygiene." In the latter speech
rm TlARtialf mft aw mtmtino that ".flarf
impression Was its expression" and that
"tbe only means of expression ! mos-
cular action," dropped a rather healthy
bomb among bia pedagogical audience
by declaring the "culture epoch" the
ory an Doan.
Varioua teata for determining the
exact location of a pupil on the edcua-
tionai ladder, aa well aa determining
the rating of your one particular school
aa a whole among the other schools of
tbe country, were diacusaed and illus
trated by Miaa Fox. her work waa es
pecially Instructive and interesting to
the grade school teachers, having for
their difficulties immediate and oracti-
cal value.
J. A. Churchill, state aunerlntendent
of public instruction, in an address on
Tuesday gave a general outline of pro
gress, plans and prospecta in hia depart
ment, noting briefly on points of im
mediate vital interest to Oregon teach
ers. In tbe evening of tbe aame day
Mr. Churchill made an address before
the Odell Parent-Teacher Association.
Following a very well presented talk
on "Habits of Saving" bv Truman
Butler. Prof. E. D. Ressler. of the
Oregon Agricultural College, spoae on
inrui, ana waa rouowed in turn by
Mr. Seymour, atate leader of tbe bova'
and girls' club work, tbua giving in
reverse order, "Getting the money,"
-using tne money," and "saving tbe
money."
Mrs. Harriet Hickox Heller, of the
Boys' and Girls' Aid Society, made a
very touching and sincere appeal for
the boya and girla in ber eare, asking
in the course of her talk on "What
Makes 'em Behave So." for Thanks
giving donations of fruit, vegetables or
money.
L. r. Harrington, field worker for
the industrial fairs, told of the values
to pupils, parents and teachera to be
derived through participation in such
lairs as be described.
Mrs. Rodwell and her dudIIs from
the East Barrett school gave a demon
stration of basket weaving that waa a
aource of inspiration to everyone who
aaw them wotk.
The musie work In the cits school
waa demontsrated by the classes of
Mrs. Cbas. Henney.
The following local people assisted in
making tbia first Parent-teacber insti
tute a success: Mesdamea Huelat.
Ferguson, Lemmon. Castner. Curtis
andPennock; Miss Bragg, Miss Bart
mess and Miss Reavis: Mr. Butler, Mr.

popular place in Hood River Tuesday

the morning .Republicans and Demo
crats alike awaited the frequent bulle
tins received by Operstor Sheffield, of
tbe western Union. The returns were
msde possible by contributions from
Pat Lindsay, club membera and busi
ness men. The bulletins, which were
read as soon aa their arrival to the as
sembled crowd in the club ball, aroused
cheers by Democrata, if tbey told of
good news ror Wilson, while Hughes
cries almost lilted the roof, when re
turns were right. The bulletins were
then flashed on a icreen on Oak street.

PRESIDENTIAL
CONTEST CLOSE
PACIF1CC0ASTSTATES ARE PIVOTAL
Hughes Wins in Hood River County
Derby Wins Over Baker, Brad
shaw in, Wilbur Doubtful
Not since the Blaine-Cleveland cam
paign has a presidential race been ao
close. The returns tbat were given
bere Tuesday night at tbe Commercial
club were very unsatisfactory to both
uemocrais and Republicans, until along
toward midnight the messsee was re
ceived thst Hughes had carried New
York by a majority of 100,000. It
waa then thought by everyone that
Hughea waa the next president. Wil
son, however, was reported as carrying1
Colorado, Utah, Montana and leading
in California and Washington, and tbe
results became doubtful. All day yes
terday party men of both parties hov
ered nervously around newspaper offices
and telegraph office, awaiting some
denfiite results.
At a late hour yesterday afternoon
Wilson had 268 electoral votes and
Hughes 243, with Minnesota, California
and Oregon in doubt. Hood River gave
Hughes a majority of 124.
Main interest in Hood River centered
in tbe races for district attorney, state
representative, aenatorship and the
office of circuit judge. A. J. Derby
won over John Baker by 123. JMr. Ba
ker's main strength waa on tbe
Heights. Judge Derby's lead at Cas
cade Locks, West, Mount Hood and
Pine Grove could not be overcome.
Geo. R. Wilbur defeated F. M. Gill in
thia county 734. Reports from The
Dalles, however, gave Gill a comforta
ble majority. Judge BradBhaw, win
ning in this county over Fred W. Wil
son, by 408, also carried Wasco county
by a comfortable majority. J. E. An
derson and Mra. Alexander Thompson
are the next Hood River and Wasco
county representatives in the legisla
ture. Mra. Thompson has the honor of
being the first woman ever named in
the district for such a position. The
votes in this county are given on the
last page, where appeara a tabulated
precinct count of all officers and bills.
The Single tax bill was defeated
throughout the state by a heavy ma
jority. Hood River anowed it under
by a large majority. The Brewers'
bill, defeated in thia county, seems to
have met with defeat everywhere. The
totally dry bill, receiving a majority
bere, may have carried over the state.
Pendleton gets a normal school.
MUNICIPAL WATER
SYSTEM REPAIRED
With S. J. Wilgar. of Portland, in
charge of the work, a crew of men haa
fust completed repairs to the big reser
voir of the municipal water system.
Because of improper construction of a
joint, the reservoir has leaked badly
since it waa built in 1912, and hundreds
of thousands of gallons of water have
gone to waste. City Water Superin
tendent Ptice has also completed im
provements at the old city reservoir,
and an eight foot wire fence has been
erected around the old city spring, for
merly the source ol supply lor the
Lower City. The old spring will be
kept as a reserve source in case of
fire and during summer months, when
heavy irrigation drains the new sys
tem.
"We do not contemplate any trouble
in having sufficient water for all needs
in the future," says Superintendent
Price. "Tests of the water from the
old spring, made by the State Health
Department, show tbat it is free from
any impurities."
Last summer a severe shortage or
water prevailed here during the hot
season because of the leakage of the
new reservoir.

EAST SIDE ROAD
GOES TO PIECES
The excessive traffic over newly im
proved portiona of the East Side ma
cadam road have caused portions of the
bighwsy to go to pieces very badly.
Although workmen completed the im
provement only several weeks ago,
holes several feet deep hsve been cut
in a long stretch, and the highway,
used more than any other in the valley,
ia fast becoming impassable.
G. H. Stanton, supervisor of the
Eaat Side road diatrict, who thinks the
new work wss not given time to settle,
baa 'recommended to County Judge
Stanton that the ebuckbolea be filled
with crushed rock.
"We have been filling thm up with
gravel," aaya Supervisor Stanton, "but
thia is pushed out immediately by the
hundreds of loaded apple wagona tbat
pass over the route daily. Such im
provement, 1 think, ia juat a waste of
time." -
