FACTIONAL FIGHT
SPLITS THE G. 0. P.
Progressives Believed to
Have Cut Hughes to
Spite Stalwarts
San Francisco, Nov. 8. P.eturns from
5347 precincts in California out of
5,917 gave Woodrow Wilson a plurality
late to-ni-;ht of 4,110. The vote stood:
Wilson, 439,896; Hughes, 435,486. Re?
publicans and Democrats alike pro
fessed to find comfort in these figures.
The figures showed San Francisco
virtually complete with a majority for
Wilson upon which his supporters re?
lied to a consideruble extent to carrv
rhe state. Los Angeles, however, with
B majoritv for Hughes, had 118 pre?
cincts left to be counted to-morrow.
The outlying counties were in dispute.
Six of the eight Southem California
counties give Hughes a majority of
4,893 votes over Wiloon on practically
complete returns. These six are Im
perial, San Diego, Ventura, San Ber
nardino, Santa Barbara and Orange.
Wilson hy 35,000 in North.
With only about 600 voters to hear
from, 89 out of 98 precincts in River
side County give Hughes, 7,123; Wil?
son, 4,178. This gives Hughes a lead
of 7,800 in Southern California out
side of Los Angeles County.
Partial returns from all Northern
California counties have increased the
lead of Wilson north of the Teharhapi
to about 35,000 votes. This is the max?
imum o fthe President's strength and
estlmates his majoritiea in the Demo?
cratic counties, where not more than
! half the votes have been counted.
"The Sacramcnto l'nion" and "The
Sacramento Bee" are asserting that
j Wilson has carried the state by 5,000.
: In this estimate there are several Re
i publican counties to be heard from.
Give State to Wllaon.
"The San Francisco Chronicle," old
, line Republican, concedes the state to
', Wilson by 2,000.
"The Los Angeles Times," Republi?
can, declares tha*. Hughes is ur,likely
to carry the state unless he wins Los
Angeles County by at least 25,000. The.
latest returns in Los Angeles (.'ounty
give 1,097 complete precinct*), out of
1,215, and show:
Hughes . 122,062
Wilson . 104.835
Ahead Only 18,900
This is a majority of 17.227 for
Hughea.
"The Los Angeles Times," after go?
ing over all the avsilable returns up
to 6 o'clock (California time) and
comparing these figures with the esti
mated vote i neach county of the
state, believes that Hughes wil lnot
get a majority of more than 24,600 in
Southern California. On the same
basis that newspaper estimates Wil?
son's majority in Northern California
as between 32,500 and 35.000. This
would give Wilson the state by at
least 8,000.

St. Paul. Minn., Nov. 9.?Republican
campaign managers early this morning
asserted MinnesoU would go into the
Hughes column by a plurality of about
l,M<i. This was based on a eareful
analysis of the returns already II
and those to be heard from.
Al midnight the tide turned to
Hughes, after having been itrongly for
Wilson for the preceding twenty-seven
hour*. Thus in fewer than five hours
Wilson's lead shrunk from more than
6,000 to nothing. Shortly after mid?
night a dozen more precincts report
ing placed Hughes in the lead by more
than TOO votes. At 1:30 2,505 precincts
out of 3,024 gave Hughes 163,088 to
162.285 for Wilson, a lead of 803.
Eight counties expected to be
strongly for the President were stilll
to report complete returns at midnight.

BALLOT GUARD
Republicans Order Coun
sel Retained in Doubt?
ful States
With the result of the election nar
rowed down to two or three state. the
likelihood of a bitter contest of re?
turns in various states where the voto
was exeeedingly elose appeared as a
spccter to the weary leaders of both
parties. Ghost. of the Tilden-Haye.i
controversy of 1876 haunted their
imagination.
lt was admitted on all side. that the
situation presented unfortunate po.si
bilities. William R. Willcox, chair?
man of the Republican National Com?
mittee, and other national leader. who
had gathered at headquarters, got in
touch with the state chairmen in Min?
nesota, (alifornia, Oregon, North Da?
kota and N'ew Mexico, where the re?
turns indicated a close vote, and in
structed them to retain counsel and
see that the party interests were pro?
tected.
Chairman Willcox left headquarters
at 7:30 last night to confer with
| Charles E. Hughes, at the Hotel A.tor.
The chairman was with Mr. Hughes
j for half an hour. Upon leaving the
I hotel he said:
"I believe Mr. Hughes is elected.
! We believe our estirnates from Cali
! fornia, North Dakota and Minnesota
: are correct. Returns which are reach
ing us bear out this view. Mr. Hughes
shares this view."
To Protect Hughes'. Vote
Mr. Willcox's attention was called
to the report that the Democrats miTht
! ask for a recount in N'ew Hampshire
because of the closeness of the vote.
He said that such a move was not con
templated at this time by the Repub
S licans in any state.
"Of course," he added, "we desire
that every vote for Mr. Hughes ahai!
be counted and we intend to see to it
that he gets what is coming to him."
Just as all arrangements had been
completed by Democratic leaders for
a contest of the Presidential election,
with a recount probable in at least
one state. Vance McCormick, chairman
of the Democratic National Committee,
received a telegram late in the after?
noon that changed the whole aspect of
things.
After one glance at the me.sage the
national chairman took a telephone
i receiver from the hook and called for
President Wilaon at Shadow Lawn.
There was a moment'. pau.e.
"You're re?>lected. Mr. Pre.ident. We
win without a .hadow of a doubt,"* .aid
Mr. McCormick, when the an.wer came
back .0 quickly a. to arou.e the ?u?
picion that President Wil.on must have
had his ear clo.e to the telephone.
Mianeaota CoBviBcea Him
"Am 1 certain?" repeated Mr. Mc?
Cormick. "Why, I have just received
news that Minnesota has given you a
lead of ten thouaand or more, with
about one-fifth of tho precincU ?till to
be heard from. That leaves abaolutely
no doobt aa to the reault."
Another pause.
"Yes. let me congratulate you on
your vietory."
Hardly a minute later the news had
?pread to the corridors of the building,
and had been communicated to the
throngs that conge.ted Korty-.econd

LEADERS OF BOTH PARTIES
CONFIDENT OF SUCCESS
Republicans Seem to Have West Virginia,
New Hampshire and Delaware; Democrats
Kansas. Washington and Idaho
The victor in the Presidential election waa as undecided as
ever early this morning.
Tabulations based on more or less incomplete returns from
most of the states gave Charles E. Hughes, the Republican can?
didate, 247 electoral votes and President Wilson 251. That left
88 votes still in doubt, including California, which has 13 votes;
.Minnesota, 12; New Mexico, 3, and North Dakota, 5.
Early last night it appeared that Minnesota and California
would decide the election. The drift in these two states, how?
ever, was such that, according to their leaning at midnight, New
Mexico, with its seemingly insignificant three votes, would de
termine the next occupant of the White House.
Hughes took the lead away from Wilson in New Mexico at
3 o'clock this morning. Three hundred and thirty-six precincts
out of a total of 838 gave Hughes 258 votes more than Wilson.
If this ratio is maintained Hughes will get New Mexico by 500
votes. The returns from these precincts gave Hughes 14.794
votes and Wilson 14,536.
At 2:30 this morning Hughes had entirely overcome the
Wilson lead in Minnesota, and was leading by 803 votes.
HUGHES LEADS BY 803
North Dakota began to fail Hughes at 3 o'clock this morn?
ing. Returns at that hour from 1,600 of the state's 1,859 pre?
cincts indicated that Wilson might carry the state's five electoral
votes by less than 200 votes. The vote on these returns was
Wilson, 48,297; Hughes, 46,844. Wilson was steadily galning,
but the state was then extremely doubtful. Hughes led in all
the earlier returns.
?A survey of the late returns from California, Minnesota
and New Mexico showed significant gains by Hughes in spite
of the fact that his early lead in North Dakota had been over?
come by the President. With 180 precincts missing in North
Dakota, at 4 o'clock Wilson was leading by 750 votes, but Mr.
Hughes then was making inroads upon that advantage.
California will probably finish in the Wilson column and
Minnesota in the Hughes list. On this basis, if Hughes got
North Dakota the final decision would rest with New Mexico.
WASHINGTON VOTE MAY DIVIDE
The uncertainty of the situation was increased by a dis?
patch from Tacoma, Wash., that there was a possibility that
Hughes would get one of the seven electoral votes of the state
by the death of a Democratic elector a few days ago. His sub
stitute is K. If. Connor, whose name did not appear on the ballot
in many counties, and the Republicans are hoping that he may
split the state's count in the Electoral College.
The returns from California and Minnesota followed a zig
zag, shifting course from late yesterday afternoon to midnight.
The Republicans gathered the largest amount of encour
agement from the trend in Minnesota. At midnight Mr. Hughes
had diminished an early indicated Wilson majority of 40,000 to
one of 1,000. This calculation was based on returns from 2,397
of the 3,024 precincts.
California looked equally uncertain. Late in the after?
noon, with less than four-fifths of the vote tabulated, Hughea
had an indicated plurality of 4,500. Later returns gave the
state one hour to Wilson, the next to Hughes.
The gains of Hughes in Minnesota were steady all night.
When 724 of the 3,024 precincts in the state had been heard
from Wilson seemed to have the state by 40,000. But so steadily
and gradually did the returns from the rural districts diminish
this almost overwhelming lead that it looked as if Hughes would
wipe out the Wilson lead altogether and perhaps capture the
state's twelve electoral votes by 3.000 or 4,000 plurality. This
prediction was based on the indication that Mr. Hughes would
retain the same ratio of gain over Mr. Wilson.
