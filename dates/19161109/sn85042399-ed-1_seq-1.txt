Grey Packhorse Is
Election Offering
The forest fire season is now over
in the Oregon national forests and
the fire wardens and rangers are all
"holed up" for the winter. "Doc"
Cambers, who has been spending the
summer roaming over the hills and
trails out in the Lake of the Woods
district, came trekking in over the
mountain Monday with his pack train
and sold an old gray packhorse In
order to have some money to bet on
election or some other good cause.
Doc says he was going to set traps
around the old gray brute in prefer
ence to feeding him through the win
ter, and figures that' win, lose or
draw, he was making money.
Mr. Cambers says that he and an
other man have been putting in a
considerable amount of work on the
road from Lake of the Woods to Pel-
ilinn liav anil ihnt automobiles can
now make the trip straight through
to Klamath Lake.
Hogs Dying from
Unknown Malady
Hog raisers in the upper end of
the upper Rogue River valley are be
coming alarmed over a disease which
(is attacking the hogs and concern
ling the exact nature of which, opin
ions differ.
One raiser is reported to have lost
to 0 hogs, and others one or more anl-
maia Tt k thnnelit 1 v some to be
cholera, but lacks some of the symp
toms of cholera.
The hogs which are atacked be
come weak and drag around but do
not die as quickly as if attacked by
cholera. At first only the herds
which were fed slop from the city
were infected, but now the disease
seems to be spreading to the hogs
which have been fed garden truck
only.
SiskiyoulTowns
Want Own Schools
The proposition of bonding that
portion of Siskiyou county Included
in the Siskiyou high school district
for $60,000 to erect a new high
school building In Yreka was defeat
ed overwhelmingly at the special
election held In the California town
Saturday.
The vote on bonds stood: Yes,
811; no, 1,160.
The bonds did not receive a major
ity, let alone the two-thirds majority
required.
There was much opposition In
Montague and Sisson and In districts
near those two towns, for each of
them wants a high school of Its own.
The result Is a great disappoint
ment to Yreka, which longed to see
built a larger and better building
than the one destroyed by fire two
months ago.
Remains of Hall
Buried at Medford
The skeleton of Charles Edmund
Hall, who perished in a snowstorm
on the trail between Evans creek and
Trail creek last January, was In
terred In I. O. O. F. cemetery, Med
ford, Monday afternoon at the wish
of H. H. Van Volkenburg, an uncle
residing In Klamath -Falls.
The skeleton was found October
25, near the mouth of Railroad
creek, by E. D. Cottrell of Beagle,
who was looking for cattle In that
vicinity.

Wilson Leads in
Elections in
New York, Nov. -The contest for
president of the United States is ap
parently so close that the official re
turns may be necessary to determine
whether President Woodrow Wilson
has been re-elected or will be succeed
ed by the republican candidate,
Charles Evans Hughes of New York.
The election hangs in the balance,
the early pluralities for Hughes hav
ing been virtually wiped out by later
Although Chairman Willcox, for the
republican national committee and his
chief aides, Frank H. Hitchcock,
George W. Perkins and C. N. Bliss,
declined point blank to concede the
defeat of .Mr. Hughes, they frankly
said that the outlook was "uncomfort
ably close."
Frank Hitchcock, the political ex
pert of the republican camp, declared
that the election of Hughes depends
en results In California and Minnesota.
Minnesota shows Wilson leading by
a substantial plurality. It is impossi
ble to forecast results, but Wilson has
made gains in purely rural precincts
this morning. The cities and towns
are in. The farmer vote will decide
Incomplete returns from California
show President Wilson leading with
good pluralities.
That one stute may decide the elec
tion seemed possible, although demo
cratic headquarters predicted that
Wilson would have a total of 300 votes
' In the electoral college.
These states were counted for Wil
son: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas
Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky
Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, Mis
souri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada
North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma
South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas
Utah and Virginia. Total, 236.

These states were doubtful: Cali
fornia. Indiana, Kansas, Minnesota,
New Hampshire, New Mexico, Ore
gon, Washington, West Virginia and
Wyoming. Total, 80.
Eastern States for Hughes.
. The east went for Hughes by over
whelming majorities and Wilson did
not carry a single state in this section,
unless, as is unlikely, he has carried
Delaware.
The democrats had been counting
on the middle west, but they reckoned
on It vainly. The middle west as a
section went for Hughes and most of
its more important states went for
him by majorities as great porportion
ately as those in the east.
Although the metropolitan news
papers which have supported Presi
dent Wilson conceded his defeat, the
democratic managers insisted that
complete returns from the west would
reverse the trend which Bteadily seem
ed to be piling up the Hughes column.
Democrats Recall 1892.
"Remember 1892," was the predic
tion of the democratic publicity bu
reau, which pointed out that in that
memorable contest the revised returns
placed Grover Cleveland in the white,
house.
A statement was Issued by the dem
ocratic national committee claiming
that with the loss of the following
states, which it was not believed
Hughes had carried, President Wilson
was still re-elected by a majority of
two votes in the electoral college:
California, Indiana, North Dakota,
South Dakota, West Virginia and Wis
consin. The committee claimed that even 1
these state were lost It will gtv
is r v f
One of Closest
History of Country
President Wilson a vote of 268 in the
electoral college.
Vance McCormlck, chairman of the
democratic national committee, claim
ed the election of President Wilson
with 270 votes in the electoral college.
Republicans Claim 284 Votes.
The republican national committee
in an official statement claimed Cali
fornia, Connecticut, Delaware, Idaho,
Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Maine, Mary
land, .Massachusetts, Michigan, New
Hampshire, New Jersey, New York,
North Dakota, Oregon, Pennsylvania,
Rhode Inland, South Dakota, Vermont,
Washington, West Virginia and Wis
consin. That made a total of 2S4 electoral
votes with more than the necessary
266 for an election.
This was the official Indication from
the republicans that the result would
be so dose. The republican managers
realiziil that a sudden switch In the
states incomplete or unheard from
might increase the Wilson figures,
but were sure the later figures would
add to the stales they were claiming.
Progressives Returned to G. O. P.
Political experts are busy today ex
plaining the return to power in the
nation of the republican party. Men
of both parties agree that the vote
shows the progressives have returned
to the G. O. P. fold. While Mr. Wil
son may have held some of this vote,
the great majority of the voters who
four years ago rallied to the support
of Mr. Roosevelt, apparently cast their
ballots for Mr. Hughes.
The vital importance of the progres
sive vote may be gained from a study
of the figures four years ago which
resulted in the election of Mr. Wilson.
At that time the combined vote of
Roosevelt and Taft exceeded that of
fe . t "
4 ?
CHARLES EVANS HUGHES
Wilson by 1,311,444. Mr. Wilson's
vote was 6,293,019, Taft's 3,484,956
and Roosevelt's 4,119,507.
The big fight of both parties was
waged In what was regarded as the
four important doubtful states of New
York, Indiana, Ohio and Illinois, with
a total electoral vote of 113.
New York Votes for Hughes
New York's 45 electoral votes will
be cast for Hughes and Fairbanks.
The returns indicate that Mr. Hughes
carried the state by a substantial plu
rality. Early returns from the state
were closely watched. In several of
the upper counties of the state, par
ticularly Erie and Monroe, voting
machines were used, which facilitated
prompt tabulation of the returns.
When the complete returns from Buf
falo gave Hughes 40,652 and Wilson
36,915, it was regarded as certain that
the republican presidential candidate
had carried the state. Early in the
evening the leading New York dallies,
including the papers which supported
Wilson during the campaign, conced
ed the election of Hughes.
Governor Whitman was re-elected
by a large plurality and William M.
Calder, republican candidate for Uni
ted States senator was also elected.
The So-called "solid South," Ala
bama, Arkansas, Florida, Louisiana,
Mississippi, North Carolina, South
Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Vir
ginia, which have uniformly cast their
electoral votes for the democratic
presidential candidates, Is still solidly
democratic, Wilson and Marshall poll
ing the usual large majorities.
If the complete revised returns bear
out early indications the present dem
ocratic majority in thrower house of
congress will be wlpedfbut and the re
publican party will be In control.
While the returns indicate there will
be a largely reduced majority In the
senate it is not believed that the dem
ocrats will lose control

State Measures
Are in Doubt
The state of Oregon went for
Hughes, unless official counts Badly
upse the present dope.
Hawley was elected by a comforta
ble majority over Weatherford.
Olcott Is secretary of state by a big
majority.
The single item veto and ship tax
exemption both carried by big major
ities. The amendment removing the
dead law forbidding negroes the vote
seems to have been voted down, but
full returns may change this.
The single tax amendment was
overwhelmingly defeated.
The Pendleton normal school Is
doubtful, receiving a good majority
in the northern and southern parts
of the state but losing in the Wlllnm
ette valley. Complete returns will
probably be needed to settle Its fate.
The Sunday law repeal has prob
ably passed.
The brewers' amendment was de
feated. Absolute prohibition Is doubtful.
Rural credits probably passed and
tax limitation likewise.
Coyotes Had Best
Hunt for Cover
Fred Herrln has eight great big
puppies of the Russian wolfhound
breed of which he is justly proud.
The puppies are but a few months
old, but stand as high as a man's
waist. They are the offspring of the
two prize winning registered wolf
hounds which Mr. Herrln purchased
at the San Francisco fair, and which
have proven to be coyote extermina
tors of the first grade.
Full blood Russian wolfhounds are
said to be much in demand and bring
fancy prices and Fred anticipates
realizing the rather hefty purchase
price of the original pair In a short
while. He bought the hounds to pro
tect his sheep from coyotes, the fleet
animals overhauling the varmints In
short order. The hounds are big,
rangy animals, almost as thin as a
board but beautiful In every line.
The pups are too young to have their
education far advanced as yet, and
appear a little awkard as yet.
This season has been a bad one
on sheep. Forest rangers report the
loss of 50 sheep from the Canal
company herd at Big Meadows this
summer.

California Stays
In Wet Ranks
California voted down both prohi
bition amendments, and the oases
over the line will not dry up for at

All Republican
But One in County
With complete returns from every
precinct In Jackson county but Pine
hurst and part of Sams valley, the
election of the solid republican dele
gation to the state legislature is as
sured, and with the exception of
Curly Wilson every republican can
didate for county office was elected.
The result In this race may bo
changed by the official count, as Jen
nings only leads by eighty votes.
Wilson ran far ahead of his ticket
In Jackson county, with a majority
of 1,233 votes, running very strong
In Medford but losing out In the
outside districts.
The county will send Sheldon,
