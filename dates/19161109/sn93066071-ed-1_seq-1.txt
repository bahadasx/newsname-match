What some people spend foolishly is making others rich, and
somebody is saving a part of what you spend.
You do not in the end deny yourself pleasure when you save,
because saving becomes a pleasure, and results in comforts and
pleasures that no one enn enjoy unless he has saved.
You are riot stingy when you save, but hjensible. Don't deny
yourself a bank account.

58,342.00 CROP OF BROOM CORN.
II. I). Wood, who owns land lifteen
miles toutheast of Braver, marketed
here last week tho biggest crop of
broom corn grown in the Southwest
ttils year. We doubt if a bigger crop
has often been marketed by one
farmer any year. Mr. Wood's crop
was produced on G0 acres of ground
and Hold for $8,342 00 In rouud nuin-'
hers. He sold before the markot was i
at his highest receiving flOTi.flQ per
ton. Had tie waited a few week hit
returns wijuld, havvlrfeen muchrgreitqr,
for he had splendid -corn and could
have topped the market. As it was,
he tells us that he will net between
$0,000.00 and 17,000.00 for his season's
work which he considers good enougli
and he is not grieving because ho did
not hold for the bight price
There are eeveral things , tn con
nection with the production of this
immense crop this year which are
worthy of note. In the first place,
Mr. Wood employed all home labor in
the production, and harvesting of his
crop which Mt many dollars in the
pockets of other Beaver county farm
ers as well as the producer a moit
worthy thing to do. 'Then ho gavo
the crop the right kind of attention at
tho right time. The ground was
properly prepared and the jsrop was
not "hogged in". After tho briiidi
was pulled it was cured in sheds and
kept protected from the weather until
it was hauled to market. This is one
of the grerteet items in the successful
production of broom corn. So many
farmers grorr a good crop of brush and
then allow it to deteriorate by not
curing and preparing it for market
properly
If t lie re are those who are, still in
doubt as to the agricultural posslbili
ties of Beaver county, wo respwtfully
refer them to the record made by Mr.
Wood this year. The past season has
not been a favorable one by any meant
for wo had more dry, hot weather
than we have had for years If sucli a
yield could be produced .luring an un
favorable year, just what would have
been tho result had everything been
favorable?
Mr. Woods is tboro uglily convinced
that this Is a farming section. He has
returned to his home at Battle Greek,
Michigan, to spend the winter but will
return in the spring and put out 800
acres to broom corn,
THE MASONIC BANQUET.
The banquet given Monday night by
the local A. P & A. M., lodge was one
of the most successful and highly enter,
taining events of the kind ever given
here by that eminent organization.
An immense crowd of Masons and
their families, from all parts of the
county, together with their fraternal
sisters, the members of the Eastern
Stir, enjoyed the occasion and feasted
upon the fat of the land, as guests of
the Heaver Matons
It is our desire to give an extended
mom ion of the evening's program but
critical illness in our family at this
lime and the crowded condition of the
Herald owing to election news and
a large amnunt of advertising prevents
iis from doing so this week. We shall,
endeavor to give a full account next

If the death of Mrs. Niles the com
munity has lost one of its most highly
esteemed and respected women. The
highest tribute that may be paid to
any women, may well be paid to her
for her life was that of a nob'e, con
secrated Christian woman, one whoee
heart and soul was true to that she
knew to bo right and who did not
hesitate to make sacrillces and devote
her time and strength to labors of love
and service, Herquiet, refined, retir
ing nature coupled with her sincerity
and consecration made her life an in
spiration to all with whom she came in
contact and no one ever knew her
but to respect and lore her gentle,
motherly Christian character and were
the better for havln? known her and
the faithful life she lived.
Life will never be quite the same to
tli sa'who were near and dearest toher.
Her boys and girls will long for Moth
er and her loving counsel and advice
in the years to come when life's bur
dens begin to fall heavily upon their
shoulders and tho husband will miss
the wife's faithful companionship and
help in meeting tho trials of future
life but, through jt all, they have the
blessed assurance that Mother is free
from care and harm and that she has
only gone to tho reward which she so
richly deserved.
