"Can A. end' M. Come Back?" Ii the
Question Among the Cadets.
Team Working Hard.
"Can A. and M. come back?" That
Is the question Hint Is on every cadet's
lips. He It remembered that last year
after a defeat from Rice, A. and M.
returned home, put in a week's terrific
work and won from the University
against overwhelming; odds. Aggie
funs 'are hoping that the comeback
may be repeated this year, with Hay
lor as the victim of the comeback
process.
Without attempting to discredit the
work of tho Rice eleven, for they de
feated A. and M. cleanly. It must be
admitted that the work of the Aggies
In no way resembled the style of play
put up by them In Dallas against the
Indluns. They had no drive. Occa
sionally they showed flashes of bril
Hunt play and swept Re off their
feet for a few downs. A penalty, a
fumble or some such sin smothered
the flush and after that it was a peu
rlle attempt to guln. The Aggies seem
to be an "every other Saturday" team.
One day they play great ball, tho next
game they play high school football.
All efforts of tho coaches to make
their pluy consistent have been un
availing this year. Whether It Is ton
much old blood In the train and not
enough hard work or whether It Is a
,pure case of "temperament" and a Jinx
In so far as Rice Is concerned. Is the
worry of the cadets' minds.
Any how Harlan and Graves are
driving them this week and speeding
up the back field as much as posslblo.
If the Aggie line charges as It did in
the Haskell game and breaks up the
Baylor end runs before the Interfer
ence Is formed, and If the Aggie bark
field charges as It has driven Into the
line. Parlor will be humbled. Other
wise the Baptists will continue their
winning streak. Harlan and Graves
are noncommittal as to the outcome of
the contest, but among tho cadets
there la a growing confidence that the
Aggies are to redeem themselves for
past sins by an old fashioned defeat
with llaylor as the burnt offering.
The cadets will be thero 1,100 strong
to see their team win and If the Fann
er eleven shows the fight, the cadet
supporters have demonstrated there
will bo gloom In Waco.

Three Quarters of a Million Dollars
Hat Been Appropriated to Fight
the Dltase In Florida.
(By Associated PressJ
Tampa, Fla., Nov. 9. The fight
against the citrus canker, for which
150,000 already has been appropriat
ed, Is making rapid headway, accord
ing to Frank Sterling, general Inspec
tor of the Florida plant board. The
disease had threatened the destruc
tion of Florida's great orange and
grapefruit groves.
After a series of-experiments, fed
eral and state officials determined
that the disease could be stamped out
only by the destruction of the Infected
trees. It It to this drastic method
that expert! attribute the tuccess
which has attended , their efforts.
Crude oil Is poured over the diseased
tree and It is set afire and burned out
root and branch. In some cases, where
an entire grove Is Infected, not only
are the trees burned, but the ground
Is saturated with oil and fired, for It
hat been found that the canker germs
will thrive for a long period even in
the driest of soils.
In an address at a recent citrus
meeting at Gainesville, Fla, Mr. Ster
ling declared that the disease bad
been eradicated In twelve of the
twentyone counties affected when the
work began in 1914. He added that It
probably will only be a matter of time
until the dlsase It wiped out
The canker made Ita appearance In
Florida and along the gulf coast at
far west as Texas where cltrua fruits
are grown. It Is believed to have been
Introduced Into the United States In
stock Imported from Japan and Mex
ico. Investigations proved that birds
carried the germt on their feet and
wings.
Florida growers raised a fund of
150.000 to fight It and the Florida leg
islature appropriated $125,000 for the
tame purpose. At the instance of the
Florida, Alabama, Louisiana and Tex
as delegations, Congress appropriated
f :50,000 for the canker campaign with
the proviso that the varioua ttatea af
fected must assist with a like amount
The Florida legislature is expected to
make an additional appropriation at
the 1917 session. Although California
hat not been entered by the disease,
California Jolnod Florida in urging
congressional action.

I THE EAGLE'S CREEDS.
No. 3. Service
All business worth while, and all that's enduring, is
based on superior service.
In primitive business, one man raised corn, another'
hunted pelts. And they exchanged their products.
The basis was, "You work for me, I'll work for you."
And that basis has never altered.
Now some men study medicine, some law, some adver.
tising. Some make motor cars, some clothing and some
food.
But all are selling service.
Men don't buy brains or truck or clothes. They buy a
certain needed service, and pay in other service.
The man who shirks will fail.
The man who gives more than another will eventually
outstrip him.
Every sale or purchase, every business alliance, should
be based on service only.
If this is faulty, or if it is superlative, men will Find K
out. And a verdict will fix your place.
