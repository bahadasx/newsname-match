Home on Furlough.
Alfred Medculf is spending his
furlough with his parents, Mr. and
Mrs. J. M. Medculf. He entered the
navy in Aug. 1915 and was at the
training station in Chicago until Inst
March when he was sent on board
the battleship Nevada. It had just
been built and was at that time the
largest vessel in our navy. Albert
is a gunman in the forward turret.
When he returns he is to take up
special work as a machinist. The
Nevada is now stationed at Norfolk

Alfred is applying himself and we
all expect to see him advance in
the work of his choice.

going to press to say how the
Electoral votes will stand.

dicate that President Wilson has car
ried Missouri by at least 40,000 and
that Frederick D. Gardner of St. Louis
has been elected governor heading a
Democratic state ticket. Scattering
returns show that the plurality for
Gardner will be 30,000 to 36,000.
. Partial returns give Wilson 67,221

however, only a few scattering re

The Democrats have a good lead in

'
Aa Interesting Letter Comparing
Conditions in Missouri with
Wisconsin as a Dairy
Country ,
I Editor Monroe City Democrat:-
J In compliance with your request
lam writing you an account of.
i our trip to Wisconsin pursuant to .
!the purchase of dairy cattle. I i
twill leave the item of numbers
country we visited from a dairying
stand point and compare same to
our country and climate.
Our purchases were made in
Waukesha and Jefferson counties
which are the leading dairy
counties of the state being fully
developed and handled almost ex
clusively for dairy purposes. The
people are largely of foreign parents
being Dutch. Dane and Swedes in
the order given. The topography
of the land runs'lrora undulating
to hilly, the lowlands being murshy
and almost worthless the hill land
constitutes the agricultural lands,
numerous lakes dot the land varing
in size from an ordinary Missouri
pond to several miles in diameter
The soil is of Glacial format ion
technically known as the Miama
silt loam. The timber growth is
the same as this country, except
we saw no blacx walnut. The
obnoxious weeds are the same wuh
Quack grass added. Their native
grass is called June grass and
differs from our Blue grass in
nature, that June grass starts in
the month of June and matures
and dries up by the middle of July !
After maturity animals refuse toj
eat it, this fact leaves the count r
with out a pasture. Nearly oil
animals ore cared for in tin1
stantions, being fed grain, alfalfa
hay and corn silage The silo is
the backbone of the diiiry industry
In that country silos of vast ditnen
sinus are found one in particular
being 34x60 ft. The growing stuck
is kept in box stalls The staiitimi-.
bring in such universal use th;it
one of our party is wondering why
those people do not stand linn
poultry in stantions. The soil is ii
coarse sandy leaehy pior soil tille I
with stone varying in size from a
goose egg to a salt barrel. These
stones are harvested every y i-ar
and used to build fences, houses,
barns, silos and roads They have
excellent rock roads. The soil is
made productive by the continued
applications of barn manure ami
the growing of alfalfa mil clover.
Rye is the fall sown crop aud yields
is much as 37 bu. per acre So
extensively is the dairy industry
pursued that from Waukesha
County alone in the year 1015 there
were sold a million and a quarter
dollars worth of dairy stock. This
does not include dairy product
which would probably equal il uot
exceed that n mount. The houses
and barns are very large andsprin. chickens 1 1-2 to
brightly painted almost without an
exceptance, indicating thrift and
prosperity. We never saw a single
herd of beef cows after leaving
Chicago as we went toward Wis
consin until several miles across
the Illinois state line as we return
ed and the very first herd of cows
we saw were on a farm where the
house and barn needed painting
badly.
After studying the condition in
this great dairy eountry and com-
, .,., .
p,irnii them with conditions in our
fair country we can see no reason
why tins could not be developed
into us great a dairy country as
Wisconsin We grow nutririous
1r,,s f(,r Pasture we get heavy
I"1"1'"-""'" "f timothy-ami clover
"y T,p alf.iiri will fliurish when

H""' ,"u"th P'-'ducts to demand
yet s of age. a director in the Lake
Mills b ink and a prominent breeder
of llnlsiciii rattle, what he thought
ulwut the demand for dairy
products in the future. He replied
"They have talked over production
ever since I whs a boy"
l:i Wisconsin manure applied to
the sandy le.icby land is gone by
the third year.
In Missouri manure applied to
our Int.d is a legacy for our
UMlidcliildreti
lr. WiMunvn nearly all grains
must be pur bused on the open
market mid shipped to the farmers.
In Missouri we grow grain for
expert purposes The harvests
have been short for several seasons
but renumber tint the pendulum
of prosperity cm swing no farther
to the li ft ih.iii it can to the ritiht.
It must swing our way soon.
In Wweonsin the growing season
is two mouths shorter than in
Missouri while our land being free
of stone enable us to grow and
harvest crops more economically
than tin y.
AH in ail when we get down to
ihi' ihiiry In.-ui'-ss we will m ,ke
