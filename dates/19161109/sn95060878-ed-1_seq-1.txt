ARIZONA, THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 9,
(By Associated Press.)
NEITHER PRESIDENTIAL CANDI
DATE HAS ENOUGH TO ELECT
ON THE FACE OF COMPLETE
RETURNS BOTH SIDES CLAIM
VICTORY DOUBTFUL STATES
ARE CALIFORNIA, MINNESOTA,
NEW MEXICO, NORTH DAKOTA
AND NEW HAMPSHIRE.
NEW YORK, Nov. 9. If the results
of incomplete returns wers accepted
as final in all but five states at noon
today the electorial vote would give
Wilson 251 and Hughes 243.
Five doubtful states with electorial
vo'es are California thirteen; Minne
sota thirteen; New Mexico three;
North Dakota five; New Hampshire
four. The sudden switch of New
Hampshire from a small Hughes' plu
rality to a similar one for Wilson was
a dramatic chance, and came in an an
nouncement of the secretary of state
that partial official count revealed elec
tion officials' errors.
In Minnesota, New Mexico Hughes
is leading, while Wilson is ahead in
California and North Dakota. Minneso
ta's race is most dramatic. Hour by
hour yesterday Wilson's lead was re
duced by the rural vote, until the
Democratic lead of 10,000 was wiped
out. Then the Wilson vote appeared
ahead again, later to be offset by a
Hughes' burst. So the contest whip
sawed throughout the night until
Hughes is leading with less than 1000
today.
NEW YORK, Nov. 9. Henry Mor-
genthau, in charge of the Democratic
headquarters here said a recount will
be demanded in New Hampshire de
spite the figures showing that Wilson
leads today. It is said Democratic
figures showed Wilson's lead to be 500.
LONG BRANCH, Nov. 9. President
Wilson's first question when he arose
was regarding California. Minnesota.
North Dakota and New Mexico. It is
taken for granted by" officials that
there will be recounts in several of
the close states. The president will
leave on the- yacht Mayflower today
for Rhinecleff, N. Y., where he will
take the train for Williamstown, Mass.,
to be Godfather to his grandaughter.
NEW YORK, Nov. 9. Charles E.
Hughes, after studying the returns
this morning went motoring and de
clined to comment on the returns.
NEW YORK, Nov. 8. Democratic
Chairman McCormick today declared:
'It's all over, we have cleaned them
up; we stick unmncningly to tne ong
inal figures, Wilson by 288 electoral
votes."
NEW YORK, Nov. 9. The congres
sional returns at noon today showed
212 Democrats and 203 Republicans

ANTI-SWEARING LEAGUE
THE LATEST IN HOLLAND
(By Associated Press.)
AMSTERDAM, Netherlands, Nov 9.
An anti-swearing league is the latest
social phenomenon in Holland. If the
speakers at its foundation meet are
to be credited, the Dutchman is becom
ing badly addicted to transgressing
the third commandment, both in the
salons of the rich and in the cottages
of the poor, while cursing Is said to
have spread to a "terrible" extent in
the camps and barracks of the mobil
ized army.
Among the suggestions put forward
for combatting the evil was that em
ployers should be requested to hang
up a prohibition of swearing in their
factories and workships, and that the
government should be asked to forbid
it in all branches of the public ser
vice. CHARLESTON, Nov. 9 Ten hun
