WAITING INFORMATION AS
TO TORPEDOING OF ARABIA
Official Notice Will Not be Taken . f
No Americans Were on
Board Ship
(By Aaaorlalrd Prraa.)
WASHINGTON, Nov. 9. Full In
formation regarding the torpedoing
Tuesday of the British passenger
liner Arabia Is awaited at the state
department with concern. There has
been no report indicating that Ameri
cans were on board the vessel, but
the announcement of the British ad
miralty that a ship carrying hun
dreds of passengers, including women
and children, had been destroyed
without warning added seriousness to
the submarine questions now pending.
If it should develop that the Arabia
carried no Americans, ' the United
States probably would take no offi
cial notice of the Incident, although
the deepest interest would be felt be
cause of the possibility that it might
mean a change of Germany's methods
of submarine warfare.
A brief cablegram from Ambassador
Page at London announced the sink
ing of the liner. It made no mention
of Americana on board. In the Ab
sence of Secretary Lansing, who will
return to Washington today, no for
mal comment on the case was forthcoming.

POSSIBILITY A SPLIT
IN CALIFORNIA VOTE
(Br Aaaorlalrd Praaa.) '
SAN FRANCISCO. Nov. 9. Possi
bility of a split electoral vote Is not
remote in California. It is especially
made likely in this election because
of the scratching of A. J. Wallace,
Republican, by radical wets, because
Wallace Is one of the foremost drys.
Should Hughes carry California there
is a possibility of Wilson taking one
vote from the state to the electoral
college, or the opposite. ' In Califor
nia, presidential electors are voted
otf in party groups, each having thir
teen. When the ballots are can
vassed, the thirteen having the high
est totals will be declared elected.
