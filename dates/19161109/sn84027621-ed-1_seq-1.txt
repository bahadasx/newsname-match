City Council Held Important Meeting
Last Evening ;
The city council met last evening
instead of Tuesday, the regular meet
ing night. Eight members answered
to roll call, Mr. Gerig appearing later.
After the reading and approval of
the minutes of last meeting, President
Nash invited any citizen present who
wished to address the council to do so
before other business was taken up.
Mr. W. O. Massey asked that the city
make, some provision for taking care
of the water which flows down Fourth
street after rains. The property own
ers between Alvarez and Watula
streets from Fifth to Third streets
have been complaining for several
years of this condition, and the mat
ter was referred to the street com
mittee, with instructions to report
back to council its findings. ' - .
; A petition to have a colored police
man appointed for the Tucker Hill
section of the city was referred to the
police committee. ...
Mr. and Mrs. Jake Brown and Mrs.
M. H. Stovall were present in the in
terest of the library board. The latter
read a communication , opposing the
library ordinance now pending, which
was referred to the. judiciary commit
tee. ; " - ' V
A number of water works and sew
erage bond coupons were presented
by Treasurer Clyatt, with request
that warrant Be drawn for amount
represented. These coupons were
checked up and destroyed and war
rant was ordered drawn for same.
A communication from the civic
committee of the Woman's Club ask
ing for privilege of opening a lunch
stand near the fair grounds entrance
during the fair without payment of
license was read and granted.
Communication from -A. B. Fort
asking if the city's cottage and lot on
North Orange street were for sale, re
ferred to the building committee.
A letter from the electric light
building contractor, asking the council
to take some action on the continued
delay in delivering materials by the
railroads, was filed for information. It
seems that the railroads claim they
cannot secure care for the transpor
tation of building materials for the
tower now under construction, but as
this matter is between the contractor
and these companies the council took
the position that it was not up to this
body to adjust. y .
A letter from the Skinner Manufac
turing company regarding the prob
able delay in the delivery of a part
of the machinery for the , electric
light plant was filed. The clerk was
instructed to turn over this letter to
the contractors and notify the Skinner
company of the action of the council.
Messrs. Twombly & Henney,' the
city engineers, not having filed a bond
as ordered at the last meeting, were
ordered notified that such bond is to
be furnished at once. Mr. Ebner,
representing the engineers, announc
ed that this bond would cost an un
reasonable amount. He said that the
bonding companies insist upon charg
ing on the total amount of the con
tract, which is upward of $100,000,
instead of on $4000, as required by the
council. This leaves the matter just
where it was" at last meeting except
that a motion was made and carried
at last evening's meeting . that the
commissions of the firm be held up
until the bond is forthcoming.
A communication from the Wood-
mar Sand & Stone company concern
ing a balance due on paving work was
referred to the finance committee,

from Mr J. R. Moorhead asking for
deed to property contracted for about
a year ago, a special committee was
appointed to arrange for transfer.
The report of Inspector Minshall
was read, and is as follows:
Ocala, Fla., Nov. 1, 1916.
Mr. H. A. Fausett, Chairman, Sani
tary Committee, City Council.
Dear Sir: I hand you herewith re
port on inspections and condition of
sewer system, mont hof October, 1916.
Have located all flush tanks, and
find only 30 of the 52 connected to
city pressure lines. It is imperative
that these tanks be connected to wa
ter line at an early date, so that trunk
and branch lines may be properly
flushed. The approximate cost of
connecting will be $1400. All flush
tanks that have water connections
have been adjusted and are ready for
operation when needed.
Flush tank on West Johnson street
has no overflow pipe, and several of
the shallow type . tanks in Ocala
proper show considerable seepage. All
outlet valves in hand flush tanks
have been repaired and will retain
water in tanks until flushed by hand.
Cleaned out 183 manholes, getting
from two to. ten buckets of dirt from
each. - '
No change in condition of settling
tank at disposal plant.
I would recommend that flush tanks
or some mode of flushing sewers be
installed at the following points:
North Ocala, E. Johnson street, Mag
nolia and Railroad avenue, Henry and
Osceola, Magnolia between Smith and
Henry, Magnolia at S. A. L. crossing.
Ocala proper: Sixth and Pine streets,
10th and Pond, 10th and Lime, Broad
way and 24th, Tu sea willa between
Adams and Oklawaha, Orange street
at hospital, and lines in the rear , of
Carter's Bakery, Masters' store, Mc
Iver & MacKays, Merchant's block,
Ocala National Bank and Rheinauer's
The amount of water emanating
from-house connections will not be
enough to properly flush the lines
mentioned, which condition sooner or
later will cause considerable trouble
in your trunk and branch sewer lines.
In your contract with Bryan & Co.,
all manholes were to be equipped
with dust pans, but since the substi
tution from perforated manhole cov
ers to the solid type it was not neces
sary to use the dust pans, but I can
not find any record of credit to the
city for these dust pans not being in
stalled. The dust pans would have
cost at the time the contract was let
about $2.25 each, and there are about
260 manholes in the city, which would
involve a matter of about $600. r
Bryan & Co. were paid an addi
tional sum for substituting 231 man
hole covers, which amounted to about
$300. . '
House connections at Florida House
and 813 Fort King avenue were too
high and had to be lowered. Florida
House connection was lowered about
three feet and at 813 East Fort King
was lowered about nine inches. These
connections were very poorly cemented-
Spaces on bottom of pipes show
no cement from 1 inch to 4 inches
wide. Otherwise the system seems to
be in good condition.
Not having had the time I have
been unable to-determine the condi
tion of trunk and branch sewer lines.
Have made 84 inspections on work
started and completed and 51 inspec
tions for future connections, altera
tions and additions for October.
The following number of fixtures
have been connected to the system to
Nov. 1, 1916: Water closets, 52; baths,
38; lavatories, 38; sinks, 39; drinking
fountains, 1;. floor drains; total 173
fixtures. '

Mr. Dixon has been driving a 1914

hibit at the fair. The intermediate
classes are making an exhaustive

mercially and otherwise. They are
making a very interesting booklet of
South America, illustrating it with
free hand drawing, drawn from mem
ory, essays, pictures of Peruvian pot
tery, pampas grass, coffee, etc. The
booklets will be attractive as well as
interesting. -
