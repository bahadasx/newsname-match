WILSON RE-ELECTED-HAS 273 ELECTORS;
HUGHES 243; FIFTEENDSTILL IN DOUBT
SOUTH AND WEST ELECT WILSON;
EAST GOES SOLIDLY FOR HUGHES
New York, Nov. 10. With only New the state's votes, is claimed for Cnmp
Mexico and Minnesota in the doubtful bell by 2500.
. if nnnimra Pridnv morntnir. I Henry F. Ashurst scums to have
Wilson hns 273 electoral votes snfc, been returned to the T?enntc, defeating
whik- Hughes hns 243.
It appears that Minnesota will give
its 12 votes to Hughes,, making his
total 255.
Hughes mny get New Mexico's 3
votes, but it now looks like Wilson had
them pn his sure list.
Telegraphic reports indicnte there
is no doubt now about Wilson enrrying
California.
The Democrats still cluim West Vir
ginia, but Hughes' lend there is so
long that it is not believed Wilson can
dislodge him.
New Mexico will be very close, but
unless there are more changes to be
made in the "certain" list of Wilson
it will not affect the result either way.
Wilson's lead in California will bo
between COOO nnd 10,000.
In Minnesota with 273C precincts
counted und 288 remaining yet to count
Hughes' lead Is 811.
Of 0 states classed -as doubtful on
Wednesday, four have been assigned
to Hughes nnd four to Wilson, while
f :cw Mexico, formerly classed as Dem
ocratic, is now regarded as doubtful;
thus leaving two doubtful states.
However, in the list no longer clnss
t:d as doubtful, there arc n number of
states which the party managers re
fuse to concede to their opponents.
Contests aro predicted in a number
of states, which may necessitate a re
count with possible change of some
votes for presidential electors.

by a large plurality.
No figures arc obtainable on the !

assumed that the Democrats generally
are in the lead.

CLOSE IN KANSAS
President Wilson continues to hold
his lead in Kansas returns. It was
one of the closest elections ever known
in Kansas.
Kansas could not be clnimed by
either Wilson or Hughes in view of the
returns available early today.
It was one of the closest election
races the state of Knnsns has ever
,known. With 742 precincts out of
2474 reported, tne president nnd n total
of 112,001 votes against 107,803 for
Hughes.
The state is probably safe in the
Wilson column. Women voted here for
the first time, and as was expected,
they fnvoVed Wilson In the voting.
Women cast 40 percent of the total
vote.
Wilson's plurality may be 20,000 or
more.
Governor Capper (Rep.) and the
whole Republican state ticket seem to
be fafe.

that he ran far ahead of E. C. de Baca

Returns at Democratic headquarter
indicate De Baca's election by close to
1000 plurality, while the returns at the
Republican headquarters indicated the
election of Bursum by about COO. How
ever, it will tiiKc the returns lrom re
mote precincts, which will not reach
here until late today, to decide finally
and even then it may take the official
count on some of the candidates.
The Hughes elcctorinl ticket runs
several hundred ahead of Bursum on
the returns received, while chief jus
tice Roberts, Supt. Wagner, and R. P.
Ervien run 1500 ahead of Bursum and
appear to be elected.
