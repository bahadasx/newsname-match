the vote from that part of th,
will be enough for all practical
poses.
Grant county has given IVllsoti
somewhere between (00 and 70U plu-
rallty and l.una about r.on, while
Quay has exceeded all expectation! bj
rolling BP a plurality of SOU or more,
Neither UnfOi! nor San Juan coun
ties , normally strong demo, rati"
counties, have been heard from, and
It is practically certain that thiy will
gO far to offset any ,ig flgUfei that
may be reported fr,,tu Taos and kin
Arriba counties. Sierra county has I
shown a slight stump from what was
expected of it, the Wilson plurality in j
that COtlnty being only about ,r,0.
The state Ticket
Interest in the contest for state of
fices has been almost swallowed up
in the greatest interest In the rare i
for president and few figures are
available as to how those contests'
are proceeding. There Is reason to !
believe that Jones will run ahead ,,f
the ticket, but by how great a vote I
CB1I not be foretold at this time. Wal
ton appeal! to be running about with
the presidential ticked. De Ha, a is
running behind the ticket in the east-
! em part of the state but ahead of it
, In the northern tier of counties, so
that it is likely thai he will finish
about even with Wilson and Walton ,
As to the minor state offices it Is
almost Impossible to haaard an
guess. Only one country, Curry, has1
turned in complete returns, and there,
as was to have been expected, all the ,
democratic candidates had substan
tial pluralities, Harry L. Patton lead- i
,ng the ticket.
The best guess at this time is that;
Wilson has carried the state and that j
Jones, Walton and de Ha, a are elect
ed. As to the other Offices the can
didates and their supporters will have
to wait several days until the votes
are all counted.
