comfortable majorities. Robinson is
leading, with 26,209. Birdzell is sec
ond with 25,760, and Grace third with

"When I retired at 5 o'clook this

safe for Wilson, California absolutely
ours, New Mexico ours surely, and
that we are putting up a good Aght

ELECTORAL VOTE
OE KANSAS TO
DETESTED OUT
Constitutionality of Vote by
Group is Called into
Question.
9.—-Charles
Ses­
sion, Republican state chairman, an
nounced today that legal oounsel had
been engaged to Investigate the con
stitutionality of the electoral vote In
Kansas. He would not say where the
vote would be contested.
It was claimed at Republican head
quarters that the voters cast their
ballots for the presidential candidate
rather than for electors. The vote for
electors this year was made for the
group instead of for Individual elec
tors as In the past. Republloans say
this manner of voting is unconstitu
tional.
Note—The vote of North Dakota
and several vother states Is made by
group inst«Mti or lninvldualty In cast
ing a ballot on' the electors. If the
contention raised in Kansas is found
to be well grounded in constitutional
law, the possibilities of the result of
the election being carried into the
courts is not remote and the decision
of the national election might not be
made for weeks and perhaps months.
The Herald has asked several local
attorneys to give their opinions on the
question raised.

Hughes' plurality 806.
Returns from some remote pre
cincts in the outlying districts had
not sent returns to the oounty seats
this morning and In some counties
the vote received had not been count
ed. Difficulties in reaching some
points where wire facilities are poor
and other conditions prevailing made
it possible a final result might not be
known before night.

San Francisco, Nov. 9, (5 p. m.)—Revision by the

GUARDSMEN FAVORED HUGHES.
St. Paul, Minn., Nov. 9.—Hughes was holding his
slight lead over President Wilson in Minnesota when re
turns from 2,800 precincts out of 3,024 in the state had been
compiled today, the count standing: Wilson, 173,213:
Hughes, 173,6o2.
State officials and prominent politicians were agreed
today that the vote of Minnesota Guardsmen at the Mexi
can border might decide the presidential contest in this
state.
Returns from outlying precincts effected but little
change in the standing of Wilson and Hughes, although
the latter maintained a lead of less than 500. Unless the
slightly more than 200 precincts unreported show marked
tendency to either of the candidates, the border vote is
likely to hold the balance of power.
Secretary of State Schmahl received a telegram this
afternoon from the commissioner who took tne border
vote on Tuesday, informing him that 2,136 votes had been
cast.
The result of this vote will not be known for several
days. It requires some time for the ballots to reach the
secretary of state, who must forward them to the auditors
of the counties in which the soldiers live. Moreover, the
law provides that the canvassing shall not be closed until
more than one week after the election unless the votes of
all the National Guard members residing in the districts
have been sooner received and canvassed.
In their telegram to the secretary of state, the com
missioners said:
"Apparently not more than
700
for Wilson by the state troops. If this proved correct
Hughes would have a plurality of slightly more than
votes in the border poll.
Some of the country election judges apparently locked
up their ballot boxes without counting the votes. Several
counties reported that "returns from certain precincts were
unavailable as the boxes had been sealed and sent to the
depot for shipment to St. Paul."
Returns came in very slowly. In several counties
amendments, which made ballots longer than usual, have
added to duties tabulators who were using every means at
their disposal to reach outlying districts.
St. Paul, Minn., Nov. 9, (4:30 p. m.)—Returns for
president from 2,851 precincts out of 3,024 in Minnesota
give Wilson 173,950 Hughes 174,911 Hughes' lead of 961.
St. Paul, (2 p. m.)—Fred B. Lynch, Democratic
National Committeeman from Minnesota, telegraph
ed to President Wilson this afternoon that Minnesota
would give him a plurality of 1,000.
HOW THE PIVOTAL STATES LINED UP.
New York, Nov. 9.—(10 a. m.)—The eyes of the na
tion centered today on the western states where the count
of votes will decide the country's next president. The pivot
al states of California, with thirteen electoral votes, Minne
sota with twelve, New Mexico .with three, and North Da
kota (now almost certain for Wilson) with five. I
Overnight returns seemed to dispose of previously
doubtful states by placing West Virginia's eight votes in
the Hughes' column and giving the four votes of Idaho,
the seven from Washington, to Wilson.
