JOH^ A. FULTON
Elected Sheriff by Majority of 550
WlliSOX WINS.
The latest returns received by The
Reporter at the time of going to
iJress Thursday afternoon were that
President Wilson was re-elected.
Thursday forenoon it was announced
that the official count changed New
Hampshire from Hughes to Wilson,
this leaving California, Minnesota
and North Dakota in doubt, but ev
erything indicated that Wilson had
carried California, which would in
sure his election without the other
two, while Hughes would have to
carry both California and Minnesota.
When the first returns from the
eastern states
Avere
received Tuesday
night and Wednesday morning, they
indicated a landslid6 for Hughes,
but hour by hour his vote slipped
away as one after the other of the
western states were carried by Wil
son.
If President Wilson is re-elected,
it will be the first time in the history
of the country that a president was
elected who did. not carry New York.

J. A. STEPHENSON FRANK A. GARBER
Elected State Senator by Majority Elected Representative by Majority Re-Elected Auditor by .Majority of
Close to 400 of 170 723
The Result in Decatur County.
The.election in Decatur county was
a surprise in several instances. The
democrats elected Garbe'r representa
tive, Osborn auditor, Fulton sheriif,
and Colter as member of the board,
all of them having good majorities.,
Osborn being high man with over
seven hundred, Fulton with ctose to
six hundred and Colter with almost
live hundred. The tabulated returns
for the entire county will be found on
page 12 of this issue. It has been a
haru job to secure the entire vote
this year, many of the townships be
ing v-ry slow about sending in the
poll books, and one township, Grand
River, was not received at the audi
tor's office until Thursday afternoon.
NOTES.
It was a foregone conclusion that
Walter Osborn would be re-elected
county, auditor. Decatur county nev
er had a better or mqre popular of
ficial than Walter Osborn, and he
heads the county ticket.
John A. Fulton, who will be tho
next sheriff of Decatur county, made
one of the most remarkable come
backs ever made in the state. Two
years ago Mr. Fulton made the race
for sheriff and was defeated, by a
majority of 1494 vo*es. That would
have discouraged most men for the
balance of their life, but John took
his defeat gracefully and in the best
of humor, and this year he was elect
ed by 550 majority. It was a race
of which John Fulton may well feel
proud.
We told you that W. H. Colter, the
jolly Scotchman was going to be
elected a member of the board, and
be won out by the handsome major
ity of 462 votes. In Bloomington
township his opponent, Mr. Hill got
only 16 votes in the entire township,
whife Mr. colter had 129.
E. J. Wilson, the other democratic
candidate for member of the board,
while defeated, made a mighty good
race. In his home township, Wood
land, he received all the votes in the
township except 15 which is a splen
did tribute to him, and he can feol
proud of l\is high standing, in his
home township.
Mrs. Mabel Judd Arnold, the dem
ocratic candidate for recorder, went
down to'defeat, but she made a fine
race for the office. In her home pre
cinct of Garden Grove, which is
strongly republican she received 197
votes to 65 for her opponent .Mrs.
Gardner.
Charles Kelley, democratic candi
date for clerk of the district court,
received a mighty strong endorse
ment in his home township, Rich
hind, 225 votes to 76 for his oppo
nent. Mr. Kelley was a stranger in
many parts of the county .and he
made many good friends during his
campaign, and was only defeated by
122 votes."
Frank A. Garber, elected represen
tative on the democratic tickot, made
a consistent gain all over the coun
ty. The voters recognized in him a
man who would represent them, and
he has a majority of 170.
Fayette township did John Pulton
proud, giving him 306 votes to 158
for his opponent,- although Fayette
township Is a republican .township.

DEMOCRATIC WINNERS
1
WALTER OSBORN
W. H. COLTER
Elected ^Member of the Board by Ma
Jo^ty of 462
Mr. Fulton carried every one of the
three wards in Leon, having a ma
jority of 71 in Leon.
It is with a feeling of deep regret
that we announce the defeat of good
old Ang Weldon, the democratic can
didate for county treasurer. He made
a good race, but in a republican
county it is uphill business to elect
all the democrats. Mr. Weldon takes
his defeat in good humor. He did
not seek the nomination, and al
though defeated he has lost no
friends but on the contrary haa made
many new ones. He was running
against a popular .official for his sec
ond term, and that is a hard proposi
tion in Decatur county.
Geo. VV. Baker was defeated for
re-election as county attorney, by
Will J.-Springer, who heads the re
publican ticket, his majority being
869. Mr. Baker has made a good
county attorney, but he has held the
office for so manv years, that the
voters, expressed a desire to make a
change.
Elected a Democratic State Senator
in this iistrict.
•T. A. Stephenson, of ]#t. Ayr, has
defeated Scott Skinner, of Creston,
for state senator by about 400. Mr.
Stephenson carried Union county by
1ir, Ringgold by 432 and Skinner
has a small majority in Decatur coun
ty. This district has. not been repre
sented by a democratic senator be
fore witliin^the recollection of man.
Harding Wins.
The election in* Iowa for governor
was a great, surprise, as itwas not
even close, tiie indications being that
Harding has* be$n elected by about
100,000, running considerably ahead
of the balance of the state ticket.
C. M. Akes' Sale Next Tuesday.
C. M. Akes will hold his big clos
ing out sale at his farm a half mile
south of the Leon depot on nest
Tuesday, Nov. 14th. Mr. Akes will
sell all of his live stock except his
pure bred Hereford cattle, as he ex
pects to engage in breeding pure
bred Hereford cattle exclusively. He
will sell a large number of cattle,
horses, hogs and sheep and the sale
will commence promptly at 12:30
o'clock, not l' o'clock, iand everything
in this sale goes and as usual it will
go quick. "See his big sale adv. in
