North Branch, 20-Yal 13.
The Vale foot-ball team journeyed
to North Rranch Friday and presented
a large surprise to the Vale people who
had predicted that our boys would not
not score this season. Due to the fact
that they were outweighed, Vale re
sorted mostly to the forward pass - and
punt and were exceptionally fast in
getting down under the punts.
North Rranch opened the game
with line plunges and at the end of the
first half had two touchdowns to their
credit.
In the second half Vale tightened
some good interference and Tlce got
away with the ball for sixty yards and
a touchdown- the first touchdown of
the season, lu the next quarter Ritter
got away with one of VauNormau's
strong puuts and carried it ovef the
goal for uuother touchdown, but in the
last few minutes of play, North Rranch
scored a third touchdown which meant
defeat for Yale by a score of 20 to 13.
The line showed more '"pep" and was
very effective in breaking up plays.
Tlce, Ritter and VanNorman starred
on offence, while Williams, Adams and
Lutz were exceptionally good in break
ing up plays.
Rrown City plays here on Friday af
ternoon. Come and encourage the
boys. x
Entre Nous.
The club was entertained on Wed
nesday evening by Dr. and Mrs. R.
Clyne at their home on Main street.
Guests present were Mr. and Mrs,
Dolph Andreae, Dr. and Mrs. Alec
Pollock and Mrs. George Young.
A fine chicken dinner was served at
the usual hour and the game of 600
was then played, Mrs. J. R. Paisley
taking the highest honors for the
ladies and N. R. Herbert representing
the gentlemen.
C. Howard Plattcnburg
The second number on the lecture
i course was ra;ner smniy auenaeu,
l owing doubtless to the fact, it was ire-
j sented on the night of election and the
majority of the male portion of the
j population were not in the frame, of
! mind to listen to a lecture. ,
t Rut it was a gnat mistake to iu is
; the treat that ('. Howard l'fattenburg
give in Central hall Tuesday evening.
I N.J. Druoyor, Kiipt. of schools, in try
to introduce the spektr to the audience
made known some of the election re
turns lirat, bhowiug what was upper
most in his own mind. He was tor-
given with much lAughler.
Mr. Plattenburg is a speaker of much
energy and force aud his anecdotes
are pointed with strong, moral thoughtF.
The subject of his addrtsa to his
Vale audience was "Worms under the
Dark," bringing out, w hat he considered
the weak, festuring points in the
strength of the American people
and our country and offering ways and
means and theories for the betterment
of mankind.
His hours' talk was full of life and
inspiration, with enough of lightness
to keep the listeners in good humor.
It eeems a pity that more cannot
take advantage of this lecture course
the business men of Yale have been to
the trouble and expense of getting.
Each number is a liberal education in
many ways, and is helpful in bringing
the best in each one to surface, thereby
making life seem brighter.
Try the next number of lecture
course.
The Laf-a-Lot Club
On Monday evening was held an
other of the social gatherings of the
young ladies of the city, this one at the
home of Mayme Pearce.
Several names were proposed, that
this club might be known by a proper
cognomen, the one finally decided upon
being the Laf a-lot club, which suited
the notions of the majority, better
perhaps, than the "1 O. M." 'or the
"Why" (meanings to be guessed.) So
the new club is hereafter to be known
as the Laf-a-lot, and everyone will con
cede that it is an eminently proper
title and one that all will live up to
heartily. .
The amusement for Monday evening
had to do with the woman suffrage
question and donning the most pecu.
liar aud antique garb that could be
found, with satchels containing votes
for women, clubs, hatchets, hammers
and banners, the parade marched down
Main street and back, getting all the
attention and notority the real thing
could wish for.
Other Etunts were pulled off at the
house, stump speeches, etc., which
caused plenty of merriment. When
all had calmed down, refreshments of
pineapple, sherbet and macaroons were
served, thus rounding out a most en
joyable evening.
Detroit, Armada & Northern R'y.
iFrouiTlie Armada Times -tihtrhlc)
Last Tuesday was a busy day for
those connected with the final details
of the Detroit, Armada & Northern
Railway.
The State Railway Commission, re
presented by C. S. Cunningham and
Engineer Ryce, and the D. A. N. rail
road represented by J. II. Allerdyce,
P. N. Jacobson, I). W. Abbott, Karl L.
Davles and Engineer C. W. llubbell.
made an inspection of the Grand
Trunk crossing at Frazer. The Grand
Trunk was represented by Engineer F,
P. Sisson. An understanding was ar
rived at whereby a very satisfactory
grade crossing can be made. Interlock
ers will be installed.
The Grand Trunk crossing at Ar
mada will be inspected by the same
representation and ii is safe to say that
the same conditions will prevail here
as at Eraser. This insiection will be
made in a day or so.
Cut a few more arrangements remain
to be made. The map of the route
must be accepted by the railroad com
mission and hearings must be held
with the Grand Trunk and Pere Mar
quette railroads and theu dirt will
begin to fly.
The bonds have been sold and work
can immediately be started on con
struction, as soon as these few details
are taken care of.
The M. P. church ladies invite you
to a "Roast Reef" supper in the parlors
of the M. P. church on Wednesday,
Nov. 15th.
The ladies of the M. P. church , will
hold their annual Eazaarln the church

Home baking, fancy work, etc., will be
on tale.

'J'HERE is no more serious question for you to de
cide, Mr. and Mrs. Parent, than the kind of training
your children are to have. In many homes education and
training depend upon howr much the parents can afford to
spend.
What about Your Doy and Girl?
Will Willie have to forego his dreamt of being civil engineer,
or will Mary be deprived of the musical training she lias been
looking forward to? Will they be compelled after school
years are passed to take their places with the underpaid men
and women, untrained, without vocation?
Plan now, when they are young. Dank your money or better still, de
posit a little to their credit in this bank regularly, and when the time
comes there will be no necessary "tLiinping" tt start them o.T right.
