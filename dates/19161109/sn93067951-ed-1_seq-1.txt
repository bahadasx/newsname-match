Enthusi;
It has been the opinion of the Advertiser
that the annual recurrence of
the Chesterfield County Fair is of the
greatest importance to Chesterfield
County. Its organization and promotion
was a great and commendable
step on the pathway of progress.
And now another step of equal importance
to the welfare of our county
has been made?or rather three steps, j
We refer to the three community
fairs held last week in three sections
]
y ' of Chesterfield county.
The oldest of these community
fairs had been organized less than
two months, the Middendorf organi- 1
zation having been completed only
ten days before the fair was held,
\ Macedonia, in point of age, coming '
between these two, and yet every one
of these fairs was magnificent. The j
exhibits of farm products and live
stock, of canned goods, cooking and
fancy needle-work, it would seem, 1
could hardly be surpassed. But to j
the mind of this editor there was on
exhibition at each of these places an
item of far creator sicnifii>'inpn than
> the things just mentioned. It was the
< y spirit of community interest and co- 1
) operation manifested by every man, 1
woman and child who went to the
I trouble to prepare and bring out his j
or her best in this line or that.
MACEDONIA ,
The first in order last week was the i
fair held at Macedonia school house 1
on Thursday, November Ud. s
It was known that this section of
the county was rich in the best of i
everything the county could produce, i
and that a magnificent collection of .
products could be brought together i
that would certainly be difficult to t

match, but the shortness of the time |
mil the uncertainty of general co_ ]
operation on the part of the com- 1
munity lent an air of uncertainty to ]
the outcome. But all uncertainty !
was speedily dissipated on the 2d of !
November. The crowd came and I
packed the building and the grounds ' ]
round about. Not only did they | 1
come but they brought their best 1
products with them. There was scant -
time to prepare anything special so I
what was shown was selected largely
from things already on hand.
Among the live stock there were
some fine hogs, mules and cows and 1
in especially pretty show of chickens, i 1
Inside the building the farm prod- |
jets were too numerous to mention in 1
Jetail. We do not believe there is a 1
section in South Carolina that, can 1
surpass some of the things we saw 1
:here, and yet it is hard to say in
what line this fair excelled, for well
nust confess the canned products, the
^reserves and pickles, the cakes, light <
aread, corn bread and biscuits, the
fried chicken and roasted 'possum
leld our attention much of the time. 1
There were some interesting relics,
such as a spinning wheel, some very f
)ld candle-sticks and candle molds.
The real surprise came when the i
fancy work department was visited,
flere was a great collection of work t
hat was unmistakably the result of
nuch labor and great pains. The re- t
nainder of the county will this week
ie hard pushed to surpass the work S
hown here by these Macedonia ladies.
The speaker, Hon. E. D. Smith, i
failed his appointment and recourse J
was had to local talent. Messrs. L.
H. Trotti, W. J. Tiller, C. L. Hunley ]
ind the Rev. Barnwell Caston addressed
the fair visitors.

SHOOTING AFFAIR IN CHERAW
?
Cheraw, Nov. 7.?Yesterday, as the
southbound Seaboard train was in the
station here, May Gregory was shot
ay William E. Ingram Both are
transfer men. It seems that on Saturday
they had some words about a
passenger and Gregory beat up Ingram.
The same thing occurred this
morninir and Greeorv atrain iumned
an Ingram and the latter fired two |
shots from a 32 calibre revolver, but
only one took effect, that one going '
into the abdomen on the left side.
Chief of Police Pegues separated
them and took the weapon from Ingram,
who is now in the Chesterfield
county jail awaiting the result of the
wound.
This afternoon Gregory is resting
very well and his chances for recovery
seem favorable, though complications
may set in within the next
few days.
The first entertainment of the
Piedmont Lyceum Course was given
here last Monday evening. It was attended
by a small crowd, but a number
of those present were heard to
say that the one entertainment was
well worth the price of the entire
course. Miss Frances Lawrence,
harpist, and Miss Grace Lowry, reader,
proved to be artists of merit.
The Chesterfield Advertiser is anxious
to enlarge Itself, but a well paid
up subscription list is absolutely essential
to this improvement.
