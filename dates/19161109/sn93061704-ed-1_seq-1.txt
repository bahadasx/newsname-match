As we go to press, the latest reports
obtainable on the election of president
is that Wilson and Hughes are running
neck and neck. Calls have been sent
throughout New Mexico, urging all re
turns to be forwarded to the county
seat as quickly as possible, and thence
to Santa Fe. It appears that the elec
tion of the president depends on the re- j
turns from New Mexico and California.
Just how these states will finally cast
this deciding vote, is a guess at best.
Both sides claim both states, and noth
ing definite will be known until more
complete returns are at hand.
IN THE STATE
The first reports in the tate were
that the republicans had won with the
possible exception of U. S. Senator.
Later and more complete returns show
that the democrats were gaining, and
the last that we have is that the prob
ability is that Jones, Walton and de
Baca are elected. We say probability,
as until further precinct returns are
available, the election of most of the
candidates is nothing more than a prob
ability. IN THE COUNTY
Complete figures in the county are
not obtainable. The county clerk's of
fice has semi-official figures from a ma
jority of the precincts which indicate
the election of the Republican ticket.
According to these figures Superinten
dent Burt is leading the county ticket.
Reports from some of the precincts
are very slow in reaching the county
clerk's office. The majorities, as esti
mated at present, are not nearly so
large as at first reported.
Lucero precinct is reported to have
had two elections that is two polling
places. Two of the three regulalry ap
pointed judges of election, for some
reason, decided to hold tha election at a
place a few miles distant from that
designated in the official election call,
and taking the ballot box proceeded
thjther. The third judge, not agreeing
with them, had other judges sworn in
a id proceeded to hold the election as
called. Just what the result will be of
this double flection is not known.
Neither is it known whether it will
materially affect the result of the elec
tion. Cemetery Association
On Sunday evening the Mountainari
Cemetery Association was organized,
fie objéct of the organization being to
hive charge of and care for the local
cemetery. Officers were chosen as fol
lows: President, B. L. Mitchell; Vice
President, Mrs. liollon; Secretary.Chas.
L Burt; Treasurer, Miss Nelle Han-
Jon; Custodian, Clem Shaffer. Jt wan
decided to fence the Cemetery grounds
us soon as possible. It was announced
that a portion of the money necessary
f jj- the purchase of the wire is in hand,
I", is hoped td secure tl.c posts and labor
through donation. A decision was
reached to name a day, on which all
would be asked to meet at the grounds
and erect the fence, the ladies accom
panying with lunch baskets. The day
will be announced later.
A committee is tobe named by Presi
dent Mitchell to confer with the Fed
eral Forest Reserve authorities re
gal ijing the road leading from tpwn tp
the cemetery, in an effort to secure the
co-operation of the government in
building the road. This will lead direct
ly past the Ranger Station, and is thus
one In which the government is inter
ested. it is the intention of the people to
have the grounds plotted, and later se
cure title to the whole eighty acre
tra;t.

OF HER NEW-SCHOOL
We are pleased to give our readers a
glimpse of the new school building,
erected during the past summer at
M nmtainair. Occupying, as it does,
an elevated position at the upper end
of what is known on the plat of the
townsite as Broadway avenue, the prin
cipal business street of the town, the
structure is admired not only by our
own people, but by hosts of visitors.
Early in the past summer plan3 and
specifications furnished by E. H. Nor
ris of Albuquerque, were adopted by
the local Board of Education, calling
for a one story and basement building,
the main portion being 39x80 feet with
wings on both north and south, each
28x51, making the extreme dimensions
80x96 feet, the building to be of na
tive stone and brick, with stucco finish.
On entering the vestibule, one passes
directly into the auditorium, a room
38x66 feet, well lighted and ventilated.
The ceiling of this, as well as of all
class rooms, is of steel in pleasing de
signs, painted in ivory white. At the
rear of the room is a large stage with
dressing rooms on either side. This au
ditorium is for the use of the school as
an assembly room, as well as for com
munity meetings of the public general
ly. Opera Chairs have been secured
for the seating of the auditorium.
To the north of the vestibule is the
superintendent's office, used also as a
meeting place for the Board of Direc
tors. Cloak rooms occupy a similar
space to the south.
Both to the north and south of the
auditorium are two class rooms, each
of the four being 25x28 feet in size,
giving ample room for all pupils any
one teacher should have under his con
trol. In all class rooms the windows
are so arranged in connection with the
seating that the light is to the left of
the pupils. The rooms are furnished
with up-to-date teachers' desks and
individual desks and seats for the pu
pils. 7'
Ip the basement is found a commodi
ous Play room, where the children may
find recreation on stormy days, when
outdoor sports are impracticable. At
the rear of this Play room are located
the toilet rooms, each completely fur
nished. To the south of the Play room
are found Domestic Science Sewing
and Cooking rooms for the girls, while
to the north are the Boys' Workshop,
Manual Training room, Boiler and Coal
rooms. The basement is now being
completed, and will be furnished with
complete working materials for the
actual training of the chiklreri.
A, 680-poupd bell with 82-inch base
has been placed in the tower; its musi
cal tones are heard far beyond the town
limits..
The structure is heated by steam,
which in connection with a complete
ventilating system, assurps the health
of the children while In attendance at
school.
The structure, complete and furnish
ed, embodies an outlay of about $15,-
000, and every penny of that shows to
have been used to good advantage. The
contractor, Floyd Moore, of Belen, has
reason to be proud of his" work, his con
tract having been faithfully filled to

the name of master-workman, and
Mountainair people are glad to endorse
his work.
The board of Education has erected a
monument in Mountainair, which will
stand to their honor, long after they
shall have passed away. Their fidelity
to the trust has been remarkable. Each
member has always stood ready to give j
unstintedly of his time, experience and
business qualifications to the work. It
is often said that the schoolboard should
be composed of parents of children ac
tually in school. While this may be true t
as a ruie, nere we nave a board really
interested in the work, no member of !
,
which has a single child in the school
The board is composed of W. R. Orme,

and M. B. Fuller.
The local board has also under its
control the school at Pleasant View,
six miles northeast of town, where
Mrs. W. N. Walpole 3 in charge of the

The board is providing for the con
venience of the children of the western
portion of the district, in making ar
rangements for a wagon to make regu

SCHOLLE MINING CAMP
A VERY BUSY PLACE
Dr. Wilbur B. Fumphreya, general
manager and Stock holder of thl Van
Horn Consolidated Copper Mining Co.,
of Scholle, was in Mountainair Monday
night and Tuesday. He reports the min
ing camp as booming. Twelve cars are
loading with ore according to his re
port. He billed a car out for his com
pany on Monday, on which he had an
assay of between five and six per cent.
He said a second ' ear would be billed
out Tuesday evening. There are now
four stores in camp, all doing a rushing
buhiness, groceries disappearing from
the stores almost as fast as they can
be brought in.
Real Estate Transfers
D. S. Byrd, has purchased the Geo.
W Winsatt farm in the Mestena draw.
The John H. Penny place, north of
the Mestena draw has changed hands,
Elmer E. Shaw being the new owner.
J. S. Dyer has closed a deal for thé
two lots just east of the Voss Building,
in which he has his garage, and will
build an up-to-date garage at once. He
plans a pebble-dashed building. He se
cured these lots from John W. Corbett.
Lester A. Williams has purchased
three lots south of the Methodist
church. He has also secured a neat
cottage in the country which he will
move into town oñ these lots, when he
will become citified.
Alice L. Brown has purchased the
Rev. Thomas B. Hall farm, some seven
miles southeast of Mountainair.
Thursday Afternoon Club
Mrs. Fulton entertained the Thurs
day Afternoon Club very delightfully
on November 2d, with more than the
usual number present. All felt the af
ternoon well spent in an unusually
pleasant and instructive manner.
Mrs. leiiora was not present as
leader on the program, but Mrs. Cowles
read a paper on "How to live long,'
that filled the vacancy on the program
very acceptably. Mrs. Corbett was
leader in Current Events, and a num
ber of events that had escaped some of
the ladies, were read and discussed.
Mrs. Farley rendered a solo very beau
tifully. Mrs. Fuller read a short paper
on the Life of Mrs. Carrie Jacobs Bond
and Mrs. Hanlon read an appeal to the
women to help save many of our beau
tiful ruins in this country.
Various subjects were brought up
for discussion, the afternoon ending
with refreshments being served by the
hostess, assisted byMissBernice Orme,
Mining Company Incorporates
The Blue Star Mining Company has
been incorporated, with V. S. Cavins,
Julius Garrett and Geo. M. Prichard as
incorporators. The capitalization
$150,000. Some fourteen or fifteen
.i .
ciaims are in. me group covered, and
work is expected to be pushed on these
at once.
The report on bean shipment from
the loca) station is fifty ears billed oat
to date, with three more loadinf. Dur-
ng the past week, there were twelve
cars billed out by Agent Copeland.
With beans averaging about 2G00 per
car, this means something near $30,000
brought into the valley by this means
during the past week. The beans ship-,
ped from Mountainair this season baya
brought to the farmers of this vicinity,
over a hundred thousand dollars, with
the prospect of as mueh more to come
in the future from this year's crop.
Some of the bean-crop-stories this
year read almost like fiction. Here is
one of that sort, but. ft vouched for
by all parties concerned last year B.
Mitchell bought the R. C. Suthers
place near Mountainair. He rented it
to Hiram Hollon for one-fourth of the
crop, whether good or bad. The bean
crop has been harvested and marketed,
and the rental has paid the entire
purchase price, with an additional in
terest on the investment of a little over
ten percent. In other words this years
crop was a little more than 440, per
cent, of the purchase price.
J. H. Cumiford was jn town last Sat
urday and called our attention to an
error in a statement made in last week's
issue. We gave him credit for having
grown 130,000 pounds of beans on" 180
acres on the Mesa south of town, when
he had only 100 acres in beahs. He
says that from the first ten acres he
threshed 17000 pounds, an average of
1700 pounds per acr-. The .whole 100
acres averages 1300 pounds per acre.
At the price beans are now, this would
mean $8,450.00, or $84.50 per acre.
R. L. Shaw reporta his fifty acre
crop of beans as threshing 42,000, which
he has sold for 6 1-4 cents per pound.
This is an average vield of $52 rxr
acre. Mr. Shaw says his stand was
not the best to begin with and the eut
worms bothered quite a bit, so that the
yield was really more thai he had an-
tieipated.
Donald E. Stewart has threshed hie
fifty acre crop of beans, the result be
ing a little better than 46,000 pounds.
While this average is a little less than
some had reported, it is some beans
nevertheless, and runs well into money.
Post Office at Rayo
A postoffice, to be known as Rayo,
Socorro county, is to be established as
soon as the necessary steps 1 can be
taken. John W. Conant was in Moun
tainair the last of last week, and made
his bond as postmaster. The new of
fice will be twenty-six miles southwest
of here, beine almost due south of
Scholle, twelve miles. The office will
serve a number of people who have
heretofore been remote from postal ad
vantages. Ladies Aid
The Ladies Aid Society of the Metho
dist church is desirous of securing sew
ing including the making of comforts,
quilta, etc. for the public. All work at
reasonable j-ates. The next meeting
will be with Mrs Hanlon on the 22d,
and any wanting work done should re
port it prior to that time.
Breaks Arm
While playing on the "See-saw"
Tuesday evening at the schoolhouse
Oral Hollon had the misfortune to fall
to the ground, sustaining a fractured
arm. Dr. Buer reduced the fracture,
and Oral will carry his arm in a sling
for a while.
