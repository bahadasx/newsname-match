EDUCATION IN SANITATION
Knowledge rightly used is a
power for good. . .,..,... ,
Florida's State Board of Health
6as believed for a good many
years that the prevention of dis
ease is considerably more sensible
than to permit it x come and then
try to get out of trouble by curing
it.. A large share of its efforts for
the public good has. been along the
line of education in sanitary
matters, with the idea that a
knowledge of the conditions that
invite disease would be forearmed
against it.
Not many centuries have passed
since diseases especially the epi
demics which have ' ravaged Eu
rope and decimated its population,
were thought to be an unavoidable
visitation of the wrath of an ang
ered deity, and not many decad
es ago our grandparents regp'd
disease and death as a sort of
Christian discipline for those who
were spared and an awful fate (in
the majority of cases) for those
who were not. Doctors in those
bvjrone davs had a reputation of
having some mysterious partner
ship with the devil a"d they had
to keep up the deception or admit
the truth that they didn't know
a great deal more about disease
than did their trusting and fear
ing patients.
But the up-to-date physician, in
cluding the profession of the last
30 to 50 years, recognizing the u
niversal law of cause and effect,
has applied that principle to his
study of disease, and with this
turn in methods began the suc
cessful fight against human phys
ical ills, and incidentally the pro
fession has a more savory stand
ing in the estimation of the people.
One after another the mysteries
of disease have been revealed ;
their transmission from one indiv
idual to another and the conse
quent spreading of infection, and
means of stopping such ravages
have been studied and solved.
With such knowledge epidemics
have been averted pth! stopped ab
ruptly when started.
Of eourse, the language of the
up-to-date doctor abounds in mys
terious words and terms, not un
derstandable and hardly translat
able to the ordinary-layman, and
nil the more mysterious because
ineangingless to the unenlighten
ed. This treininology has seemed a
sort of entrenchment behind
which the profession made a last
stand for the preservation of its
sanctity and dignity and reputa
tion for unfathomable wisdom.
But these same doetors, p.irti"u-
larly the older members of th'
profession , have awakened at last
to the idea that, in order to gt
the best results for the greatest
number, the toyman must be taken
into their confidence and educated
to cooperate intelligently with the
profession. For an intelligent man
works a good deal more efficiently
if he knows what he is doing and
vvhy he is doing it. And so the
doctors have been translating
their technicalities into under
standable English and have boon
telling their patients the why of
treatment methods.
And more than this, as the doc
tor scientists have discovered the
causes of disease, they have been
telling the people of their findings
and have invited a partnership
for the suppression or the preven
tion of disease. The plan worked
from the beginning and the sick
and death rates began to show
signs of decrease. It developed
the profession or science of sani
tation. It demonstrated the im
portance of cleanliness of person
and surroundings and showed the
relation between filth and disease.
It went a long way to prove that
the doctors were practically help
less to maintain any high degree
of public health unless the public
helped.
Florida's Health Board has been
among the pioneers in this coun
try in the effort to systematically
educate the people and only those
who can't read the English lan
guage need be ignorant, in this
state on matters of sanitation.
But yon can't make the hrffe
drink if he doesn't want to. Flor-
SON AND
Presidential Contest Close Looks Like a Democratic
Victory Complete Returns Not ha From All States
Sidney J. Catts Wins Out for Governor of Florida Has Big Lead in Vote
of the State The Election in Punta Gorda
At 3 o'clock Wednesday morn-1 Maryland seemed almost certain
ing, both sides were claiming the ly Democratic,
presidency. What seemed to be Missouri, Indiana, Wx?st Virgin
almost a certainty earlier in the'ia, Arizona and .'Delaware wero
night that Hughes would be re -
turned winner became less and
less certain as the returns were
received.
Democrats recalled the last
Cleveland election, when it took
until the, following day to deter -
mine the result. New York went
for Hughes, as also Pennsylvania,
and apparently Illinois and New
Jersey. "Wilson carried Minneso
ta. The Democrats for the first
time in forty years have elected
a Senator from Rhode Island.
At an early hour yesterday
morning, Democratic Chairman
McCormick was claiming at least
268 votes for President Wilson,
rind Republican Chairman Wilcox
claimed 301 for Hughes.
Each was claiming the doubtful
states. Kentucky, Kansas, Mon
tana, Nebraska and Washington
on the face of early returns were
leaning toward President Wilson.-
ida people mav, and do, have" a
general knowledge of sanitary
principles, but unlesn this knowl
edge be applied it isn't of much
use. Indifference is one cf the
greatest enemies to efficiency. It
is better to lock the door before
the horse is stolen, and the wise
man and he is the lonely one
works quite as earnestly to pre
vent disease as to cure it. State

WILSON A SURE WINNER
At 3:30 yesterday, The Herald
received the j following special
from Tampa. "
Wilson has 254 votes sure, and
has ten states from which to get
twelvo needed. He is leading in
all of these except California.
Latest returns show that he car
ries New Hampshire, lie looks
like a sure winner.
Tampa Times advises Herald
this morning: "Early Associated
Press reports showed Hughes 247
electoral votes, Wilson 251, with
California, Minnesota, New Mexi
co .and North Da,kota still doubt
ful. Little later New Hampshiro
was claimed for Wilson by 94
votes, cutting off four of Hughes'
electoral votes.
The Election in Punta Gorda
The day was bright and beauti
ful. Notwithstanding the preced
ing warm campaign, quiet reigned
and good feeling prevailed.
The vote polled was only 240,
which was about two hundred
short of " the registration. The
Democratic electors received from
102 to 145, the Republicans from
41 to 57 and tho Socialists and
Prohibitionists 1 to 10.
The vote for governor was: C.
C. Allen 6, George W.-Allen 46,
Sidney J. Catts 123, W. V. Knott
53, Noel A. Mitchell 2. Tho Catts
vote was much less than had been
predicted while that for Knott
was a few more than was expect
ed. This result was due perhaps
to the unjustifiable attack which
Rev. Catts made upon the editor
of the Herald, some of whose
friends resented it bv voting for
Mr. Knott or not voting at all.
The editor keenly appreciates
their manifestation, but, at the
same time, cherishes no ill will to
wards those who voted for Rev.
Catts, for several of them have as-'
sured the editor that thev did not
approve of the attack made upon
him. i
The rest of the Democratic voto
for those stato offices which were
not contested ran from 83 to 183
The largest was for Attorney-General
West, the smallest for Su
preme Judge Taylor, which shows
the result of the fight made on tho
latter.
There was no contest for nnv
of the county officers ; consequent
ly, all of the Democratic nominees
are elected. "
In this district, S. F. J. Trabue

On the proposed constitutional
amendments, the vote for the wid
