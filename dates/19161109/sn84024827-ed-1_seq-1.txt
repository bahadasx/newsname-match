PHOENIX, Nov. 9. Complete return from no county have been
received and uch figure at have come relate only to the guberna
torial contest Campbell, Republican, haa been elected over Hunt by
an estimated majority of 1050.
Democrat have elected United State senator, representative in
congress and all state officer except governor. From uch figure as
have been received, Wilson's majority over Hughes is les than 1500.
With twenty six precincts
in
Cochise county counted and com
plete, Tbos. E. Campbell, Repub
lican candidate for governor, is
leading the incumbent by 353
votes. The precincts in the table
which is shown in detail on an
other page of this morning's pap
er, do not Include Bisbee 1, Bis
bee 2, Lowell or Upper Lowell,
all of which are conceded to Hunt
The list does Include, however,
four of the six Douglas precincts
and Pirtleville.
Hunt Carries Bisbee
Though no accurate figures can
be had on the gubernatorial vote
in Bisbee it would appear that
Hunt carried the city by a small
vote. He also carried the Dis
trict but his majority was cut to
1
a minimum.
Miss Toles Wins
The only Republican, on either
county or state tickets, to carry
Cochise county, based on the
available returns, was Miss Elsie
Toles who was far ahead of her
opponent. Miss Minnie Lintz, at
an early hour this morning. Miss
Toles is undoubtedly safe by a
good margin.
All Rest Democrats
All other county and state officers
on the Democratic ticket have been
elected. Hayden will undoubtedly
lead the ticket. The Democratic legis
lative ticket is also Bate by a good
margin.
In Bisbee precinct Judge High and
Bert Polley have, undoubtedly, been
elected.

Still In Doubt With Wilson Barely Leading
Democrats Will Control
Both Houses of Congress
(By Review Leased Wire)
NEW YORK, Nov.; 8. Although the
Democrats are assured control of the
Senate by a working majority, control
of the House was still in doubt at an
early hour today. The Democrats
had made slight gains, however, in
the late returns in Montana and Kan
sas. At one o'clock 205 Democrats,
198 Republicans, 2 Progressives, 1 So

elected with 25 congressional dis

Of the 30 district yet to be heard
