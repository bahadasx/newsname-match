The majority is small, but the
oddB to overcome were great.
Kentucky is Democratic by
close on to 80,000 majority;
Powell county is Democratic by
is rho lnroest Democratic ma.
auuj w - - cj
jority in recent years. Olay Oity
gave a.majority of 65 votes.
Whpn such stateB as Ohio goes
to the good to the tune of 30,000
Democratic majority, it sound?
like real prosperity. Not, how
ever, that1 all Democrats are al
ways good, but that President
Wilson is unquestionably the saf
est availahlo man in this govern
ment today.
Itis not to be claimed that this
country has gone. Democratic,
but roust Jifi admitted that the
election of Wilson shows that the
voters are arising above petty
politics to indpendently vote for
tlie man and principles that best
Huit them eveu though it is
against the party of their tradi
tion. .
Claims Mountain Land.
Mrs! Leo' Childers, a niece, of
Jesse W. Jones,- deceased, former
postmaster at Union Hall, - and
Mexican soldier, is laying claim
to liis land about Uuion Hall,
which is In the rich oil territory.
When Mr. ones died a few years
ago at the advanced age of nine
ty years, lie left his land to two
negro children that he had raised
in his home. Mrs. Guilders will
claim that her uncle's dote age
incapacitated him to make a
will..
Thanksgiving Turkey.
The indications nre that the
Thanksgiving turkey will be very
high this year. Buyers have not
yet shown up in Powell, but we
have heard it rumored-that this
choice bird will go to 20 cents
per pound on foot wheu the mar.
ket opens at the proper time. Wo
hope- this is true for we have a
far greater interest, In a general
way, in the producers of the bird
than we have in the consumers
of the bird.
The Kentucky Magazine.
The Kentucky Magazine, pub
lished at Louisville and Losing
ton. has made its appearance, and
is a publication worthy its name
and a generous support from the
people of the State, but will
theygive it?

The Right Step for Roads.
The Estill County Fiscal Court
held a special term of court at
Irvine Wednesday, and among
other important matters laid the
foundation for the only success
ful way for that county as other
mountain counties, to get good
roads. Tlifl Uotirfc passed an or
der for the county to put. up $500
when the citizens of, the county
put up 82,000 for the improve
ment of any inter-county seat
road. It was understood that
Richmond road people were ready
with the necessary dough to put
up the people's part of tha
cash.
If the Powell County Court
would only be so liberal we would
soon have turnpikes radiating
from Clay City in every direc
tion.
All But the Roads.
Tbe way Whitt has been sell
ing automobiles lately it seems
that all that can be lacking for a
continuation of this business is
nothing but the roads to run
them over during the winter
months. So now if Henry Ford
and the gasoline makers would
get busy and Help the home folk's
build some roads, there would
soon be something doing in old
Powell in the way of travel.
Eaton Mahone.
Wm. Eaton, -our town marshal,
and Miss Sallie Mahone, of Rich
mond, were married at the Olay
Oity Hotel, this city, Wednesday
afternoon, by the Rev. M. S
Wilson, pastor of the Methodist
church. The bride is a daughter
of Wm. Mahone, who lived in
this city several years ago. For
the past ten years she had been
a trained nurse.
Farmers Busy.
Farmers lit this time are very
busy gathering their corn. The.
continued dry weather enables
them,' o crib it a little greener
thanVcbmmon. This condition
should not be' too strongly relied
upon, for scarcely is there a year
that there is not more or less
corn spoiled in the crib. The
cause for this is generally a lack
of space. No crib should be more
than six feet wide, high from the
ground, and well ventilated, the
floor as well as sides.
The- Fine Rain.
The spleudid rain that is fall
ing this afternoon will be of
much value. It will be of great
benefit to grass and small grain,
will also bring corn fodder into
case so corn husking will be more
agreeable, and last but uot least,
it has laid the annoying dust on
the roads aud streets.
Some Election Returns.
The commission form of gov.
emmeut was voted down Tues-
dav at Winchester while the wa
terworks proposition won by an
overwhelming majority. Clark
county went for Wilson by a ma
jority of 912 votes.
Irvine voted $12,000 street irn-
provemoutbonde Tuesday, On
ly forty-two voters In the city.
registered suffrage against this
indebtedness,
Come Home to Vote.
Half a score or more of tho
boys were ou the train Saturday
night, coming home to vote for
Wilson and Hughes. And they
did not all come in on Saturday,
as other days brought more of the
Powell boys to their native heath
to register their choice for Presi
dent. The Powell boys are al
ways loyal to their homo aud
party and the only regrettable
thing about it is that there is not
employment at home for tho
boys who are so devoted to their
home and people.
Why not 1916?
State Division Engineer O. R.
Thomas openly told tho court at
Stanton in one of its recent meet
ings that the $10,000 in bonds
was enough money to improve
every road the court ordered im
proved Feb. 28th before the vote
was had ou the bonds, and which
order specifically called for such
improvement during 191G. Then
why delay? Mr. Court, it is up
to you to explain. A word in
these columns' will be appreci
ated. Let us hear from you.
Why We are Late.
The reason' why we are late
this week is the senior editor has
been forced away from the office
every day pn, a,cconn,t of other
business, and the junior -editor
has. also been kept away, part of
the time, and portion of the
other part time has had to be en
gaged by him, as all other young
Democratic bloods, by Wilson
shouts and hurrahs. Our old
standby, Mr. J. W. F. Williams,
will be with ua after this week
when we. hope to be more prompt
in presenting our editions.
Pony Runs Away.
Tho young pony of A. M. Bur
gher became frightened Saturday
while being allowed tp drink in
the river. A piece of drift float
ed downstream, strikins the
pony which caused it run up the
hill, overturning the buggy and
badly damaging it. It was being
driven by Shelby Burgher at the
time of tho accident, but who es
caped injury.
Court Delayed.
It should bo remembered by
all that Circuit Court will uot
convene at its regular term time
this mouth which would be Nov.
20th, but has been deferred to
Nov. 27, on account of the neces
sary absence, of Judge Shackel
ford. It must not be taken that
the change is permanent, for it
applies only to this one term.
Taking Depositions.
JudgoJ. Smith Hays and At
torney Chas. E. Spencer, of Win-
Chester, were in Stanton Monday
taking depositions iu an impor
tant, land suit which will come
up at the November term of
court.

dent to date is 8,508,712; tho to-
tal Hughes vote is 8,160,401. A

Terrible Accident.

Irvine last Wednesday as a result
of an explosion of 300 quarts of
nitroglycerine, which the men
were hauling to tho Furnace
fields to be U6ed in shooting oil
wells.
The victims of the sad acci
dent were J. C. Crouch and James
Edwards, both of Monticello, Ky.
They were employed as expert
well shooters.
The cause of the explosion will
perhaps never be known, but it
is supposed that the jolting of
the wagon caused the deadly ex
plosive to let go.

horses werefouud at varying dis

to one of the men was found a
