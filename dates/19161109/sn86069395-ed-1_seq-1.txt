Late Returns Necessary To Tell Who Has
Been Elected in a Neck and Neck Finish
In The Presidential Contesl, Fraught
With Many Surprises.
looks m
New York, Nov. 8. -Democratic
Chairman McCormick claims 288
votes. The Democrats retain the
Senate and the House seems safe.
Wilson has Ohio by 80,000, Wyoming
conceded, Kansas by 15.0CO, North
Dakota by 800, Utah by 15,000, Min
nesota by 8,000 and California by
7,500.
All day yesterday crowds hung
about the Postal Telegraph office,
where bulletins were caught from
time to time. The news grew better
all day. Democratic headquarters
claimed 265 votes sure with several
western states in doubt. These
came in for Wilson and when Cali
fornia was reported safe for Wilson a
bulletin came claiming 288 votes safe.
Wilson's election is now claimed con
fidently. Everj report grows better,
New York, Nov. 8. Vance C. Mo
Cormickj-chairman of the democratic
national committee at midnight said:
"Our reports received up to mid
night showed that the president had
received certainly 270 electoral votes
not including Massachusetts and Con
necticut or California and other far
western states yet to be heard from."
Up to half past twelve Mr. McCor
mick had declined to give out a list of
the states upon which he claimed 270
electoral votes for President Wilson.
Just before midnight tho election
returns still incomplete in many
states indicated tho election of Hughes
and Fairbanks, but the figures were
very close and the democratic mana
gers steadfastly refused to concede a
republican victory.
Although tho metropolitan news
papers which have supported "Presi
dent Wilson conceded his defeat, the
democratic managers insisted that
complete returns from the west
would reverse the trend which steadi
ly seemed to be piling up the Hughes
column.
WILCOX CLAIMS 254 VOTES.
Just after 11 o'clock, republican
headquarters absolutely claimed Con
necticut, Delaware, Illinois, Indiana,
Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, New
Hampshire, New Jersey, New York,
Oregon, Pennsylvania, R&xle. .Island,
JUDGE C. H. BUSH.
South Dakota, Vermont, Washington,
West Virginia, Wisconsin and Cali
fornia, with a total of 254 electoral
votes. That was twelve less than 2G6
necessary to an election.
WOOLLEY DISPUTES STATE
MENT. When shown the list of states
claimed by the republican national
(committee, Robert W. Woolley, direc
tor of publicity of the democratic na
tional committee said that the claim
of the republicans was without foun
dation. He said that of the states
named, Connecticut, Idaho, Delaware,
Iowa, Maryland, Massachusetts, Mich
igan. North Dakota. Oregon, South
I Dakota, Washington; West Virginia
land Wisconsin were as near as demo
I cratic reports showed, probably for
President Wilson. Of these states
i Mr. Woolley declared Delaware,
West Virginia, Maryland and Wis
consin were certainly for Wilson and
in all other states reports showed that
Wilson was leading.
Speaking for the democratic nation
al committee Mr. Wooley claimed the
following states having a total of 313
electoral votes: Alabama, Arizona,
Arkansas, California, Colorado, Dela
ware, Florida, Georgia, Indiana,
Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mary
land, Minnesota, Mississippi, Mis
souri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada,
New Mexico, North Carolina, North
Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon,
Texas, Utah, Virginia, Washington,
West Virginia and Wisconsin.
Early reports Tuesday night all
pointed to the election of Hughes but
the actual figures as they came in lat
er in the night did not confirm the'
first estima s in many instances. By
mdn'cht the news came that tie
Democrats by no means were ready
to concede the victory to the Repub
licans. While Wilson lost both New
York and New Jersey, he showed up
strong in the West, carrying States
where little had been expected. Yes
terday morning the news began to
grow better with every report and
Democratic hopes were revived, but
the rpsult was found to be so close
that both sides thought it better to
a wait the fuller returns.
The hope of the Democrats has not
been centered on victory in New
York and New Jersey, although they
had reason for a time to think they
would carry those states. With a vic
tory in Ohio, a chance of carrying In
diana, the outcome of the election in
Illinois declared by the Democrats to
be uncertain, and the results in many
of the Western States in doubt, the
champions of the candidacy of Presi
dent Wilson insist they have no great
reason to be disheartened. The claim
of Vance McCormick, chairman of the
Democratic National Committee,
whose figures show that the Presi
dent will win with 280 electoral votes
22 more than is necessary for
election did mucli to kindle the en
thusiasm of the Wilson supporters.
j Following are tho States claimed
( for. Hughes with good grounds:
Connecticut, 7.
