A Close Election
We delayed our issue but are still unable to tell who
will be the next President.
Roosevelt took the Republican Party to pieces, but
has not been able to put it together as successively as
was expected.
And Wilson has won a large support outside the
ranks of his own party.
Nevertheless Hughes has made friends, inspired
confidence, and will probably prove the winner.
And either man will be an able, patriotic, fair-minded
President, working for the interests of all the people, and
all the world.
Close elections make us shudder at fraud. Ordi
narily we can have the will of the people fulfilled even if
there is some fraud. But now it may actually be true
that fraud decides it! Think of the Southern States
where it is always fraud and intimidation. Think of the
cities where bribery is rife. "Let us work for pure politics.

Mountain Workers'
The most instructive and uplifting

night, November 5th.
The attendance was much larger
than usual and interest on the part
of ministers, teachers, and trustees
more manifest than ever before.
Ti. Conference opened Tuesday
evenin ith a supper in Vocational
Chapel, which was enjoyed by a
mall number of faculty members
and our visiting friends. After the
supper a few short speeches touch-

By far the most important ad

III OUR OWN STATE

tucky over Charles F, Hughes by an
approximate plurality of 24,219,

ported. The First Regiment of Kentucky
National Guard were to leave Fort

official inspection Monday.

counties in Kentucky increased
Wilson's majority over Hughes to
27,015. The official count has not
yet been completed, but it is not ex
pected to vary much from these
figures.
The returns Wednesday failed to
develop any change in the standing
of the Congressional delegates from
Kentucky. All nine Democratic
representatives were safely re
elected. In the Tenth district,
which is heavily Republican, the
Democrats gained 3,000 votes on
Itepresentalive Langley, Republican,

Hughes Lewden Elected
Governor Over Dunne.
Chicago, III., Nov. 1 Illinois was
carried by Hughes by a plurality of
175,000. Likewise Prank O. Lowden,
for Governor, defeated Governor Ed
ward P. Dunne, tbe Democratic In
cumbent, by about tbe same figure.
Tbe vote for Hughes by the work-
Ingmen, especially In Chicago and oth
er big Industrial renters, was the sur
prise to the Democratic leaders, who
bad confidently expected tbat the la
bor vote would "stick" to their party.
Democratic managers bad claimed
tbe woman vote of the state and a
keen disappointment was felt ever the
result 81s hundred thousand women
voted for the first time. Because of
the pacifist Issue, it wss predicted that
they would fairly storm tbe polls with
their votes for the President, but thr.y
did not materialize.
In the agricultural districts and
throughout the central and southern
part of Illinois, Wilson did not show
to advantage.
A defection In the normal Republic
an vote was caused by the labor vote
In some of the railway centers of Il
linois, but this was made up by tbe
swing of tbe business men to the O.
O. P. ticket.
Returns from North Dakota Indicate
that Hughes had carried the state and
that McCumber had been re-elected
United States 8enator over John
Burke, Federal Treasurer.
Iowa went Republican by more than
50.090 for Hughes and more than 100,
000 for W. L. Harding, Rep., for Gov
ernor. The rest of the Republican
state ticket and a majority of Con
gressmen were elected. A bitter fight
was made on Harding by churches
and organizations which charged that
be ws opposed to prohibition, but
Harding ran ahead of tbe ticket In
nearly all counties of the state.
Nebraska, as per schedule, went

THE REPUBLICAN VIEW
New York, Nov. 9. Charles B.
Warren, Republican national com
mitteeman from Michigan, after a
conference with Chairman Willcox
and other national committeemen,
gave out this statement as reflecting
the consensus of opinion among the
Republican leaders:
"The election depends upon the
count in California, Minnesota, North
Dakota, New Mexico and New
Hampshire. Oregon is safely for
Hughes, as is also West Virginia.
The probabilities are that the Min
nesota vote will be cast for Uughea,
but the official count will ba re
quired in North Dakota, New Mex
ico, New Hampshire and California
before the results in those States
will be definitely known."

WORLD HEWS
The English and French are
greatly satisfied wilh conditions
along the Western frontier of the
Kuropenn War. They liken the
action of the allied armies to that
of an arid which gradually eats it
way through the object it attacks.
In this wiy they believe they are
making ;ie progress than appears
to ouluprd onsen alion.
The Rumanians have been recov
ering themselves somewhat during
the past week. On (lioir north
western frontier they have scored
a signal success against the Ger
man and Auslrians in Transylva
nia. This, however, led to a coua-ter-atlack
of the Germans and
Turks in the region around the
mouth of tho Danube River. This
movement was only partly success
ful. Another vessel, the Marina, was
torpedoed by a submarine off the
coast of Ireland during the week.
Among those lost were several A
mericans. The survivors assert that
no warning was given or opportu
nity to leave the vessel before she
was struck. The government is in
vestigating the rase to see whether
it is a violation of the agreement
Germany made witii the .United
States or introduces new and spe
cial features.
A new ami peculiar phase of the
European wr has' come to light.
The countries, other than Germany
tind Austria 'iave declared a boy
cott on the German Kindergai t-.
whi"h has done so much for chi'd
liTe. In plrce. of froebel and his
idea Montessori, the Italian child
educator, and her system are b&ni
introduced.
The election in th United Btat-M
has been receiving more attention
from the European press than us
ual during the week. There does
not seem to be a disposition to take
sides although the relative influence
of the two parties on the European
situation is discussed with the gen
eral conclusion that the result will
not materially affect conditions
whichever side wins.
The resignation of Theodor Duma
has been accepted by the Austrian
Emperor. He was formerly ambas
sador to the United States and left
our country some time ago, being
recalled by request, because of hia
actions, which were unbecoming an
official in his position.
The submarine, Deulschland, has
arrived in port on its second trip
with a cargo valued at ten million
dollars. The same captain brought
it over and in part the same crew.
In reply to a question regarding the
fate of the Bremen the captain ad-'
milted its loss but denied that it had
fallen into English hands.
Japan has found occasion to make
further demands on China. Tbe
most important in a list of several
are the following: that Japan be
given the right to police eastern and
interior Mongolia and southern Man
churia, and that Japanese instruct
ors be placed in all military schools
in China. Because of financial ob
ligations China is not able to effectu
ally withstand the demands of Japan.
Villa and his band of followers are
showing a good deal of activity at
present. They have been operating
in the vicinity of Chihuahua and are
reported to have taken possession
of several small places near there.
It is probable that there are various
influences at work to make bis
movements aa noticable as possible,
and to overestimate their, impor
tance. A passenger steamer, the Conne
rnara, and a coal laden vessel collid
ed in the Irish Sea the other day off
the coast of Ireland. Most of the
passengers were lost to the number
of about a hundred. The accident
occurred in a heavy gale said to be
the worst ever experienced in the
Irish Sea.
