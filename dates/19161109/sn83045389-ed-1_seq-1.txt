NEW YOltK, November ?#.?On the
second .lay ?rte, the American people
cant their presidential hallots, the re
su" Min Ls an.I tlu> contest
M*w" ''resident Wilson and Charles
Evans Hushes has narrowed down to
" point where i; ma> ho decided by a
few Western States.
Ii is within the ranjre .?f possibili
ties that the voles Of national guards
men on border duty miBht turn some
of the doubtful States from one coJ
tniin to another.
I.ased on actual returns received t?y
the Associated Press, the electoral col
lege now K'Ves Hughes 239 votes; Wil
son 232. and leaves sixty doubtful.
Two ..f the metropolitan newspapers
which supported Mr. Hushes slvc him
votes. President Wilson 251 and
the doubtful chameter of only
California. New .Mexico and Minnesota.
\ not her. which supported the Presi
?lent. agrees with its contemporaries In
l-i\hi? him 251 votes, hut concedes Mr.
Hushes only 22s. and regards the
?>thers- in seven States?as doubtful.
' ?' 'he national chairmen ex
? serene confidence that

'A to tlie contest .tiarrowlns stead. Iy
to votes in the vital spots, re
eoui'ts are almost inevitable, and each
*d.'e is on the wstch for irresuJaritles.
There Is no .insurance that the re
sult will be fully kim?n In another
day.

Shortly after midnisht returns, such
.is were complete, or so far complete
as to be regarded as Indicative, save
President Wilson 232 votes in the elec
toral college and Hughes 239 and left
sixty votes doubtful In eight States.
