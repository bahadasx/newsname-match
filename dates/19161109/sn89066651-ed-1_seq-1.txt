After all, our most rabid Re
publican friends wilt agree it is
nothing but right for the Demo
crats to have the responsibility
another four years. If the pres
ent good times are abnormal, and
are due to fall into 'adversity
when the war is over, as the Re
publicans prophesy, the Demo
crats should be held responsible
for it, and there is no other way
to make a reasonable test of it,
but to let affairs continue as the,
are. Guess work will never set
tie any thing of this sort.. Let us
give it a trial, then we shall know
If tlio Upmihlipftn immniimi
prophesy proves true, then will
be time enough to change. T
change is progressive. Every
condition in the world is on the
change, and these changes must
bo met. .That is what the Demo
cratic party proposes to do, and
is what the people of this coun
try demand. In the future all
parties must be progressive. Old
ways have past and gone, and
the party that cannot r.ecogniz"
this is dead. . ,
