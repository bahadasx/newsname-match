TWO MINDS WITH BUT A SINGLE THOUGHT
THE PINK BOLL WORM
NOW IN AMERICA.
The pink boll worm, most de
structive cotton pt'st known, has
appeared fur the first time in
North America. The Department
of Agriculture announced Satur
tlay that worms had been discov
ered in Northern Mexico, where
their presence, the department
says in an official announcement,
constitutes one of the greatest
menaces which has come to the
American industry in its history.'
Importations from .Mexico of cot
ton seed, cotton seed - hulls and
seed cotton is prohibited under
an order issued late Saturday.
Officials of the department
were unable to explain how the
pink boll worm happened to be
imported to North America. It
is presumed, however, that the"

within 200 miles of the Texas

A YEAR OF SHORT CROPS.
Crops are small this year as
compared with last, taking the
country over. The total produc
tion of wheat this year is astimat
ed at 611,000,000 bushels against
1,012,000,000 last year, and a ten
year average of 7iJ8,000,000. Corn
makes a somewhat better show
ing, with an estimated yield this
year of 2,710,000,000 bushels a
gainst 3,055,000,000 last year, and
a 10 year average of 2,732,000,000.
Barley falls off 53,000,000 bush
els; rye more than 7,000,000:
Irish potatoes 41,000,000 bushels,
and sweet potatoes 5,000,000 bush
els. The apple crop is 9,000,000
barrels smaller than last year.
On the other hand, the tobac
co crop is larger than last year's
by 03,000,000 pounds, and the eot
ton crop by 600,000 bales. The
rice crop is larger by nearly
4,000,000 bushels, and the hy
crop by a million tons. All of
these crops are above the ten
year average except cotton.
wtiicn is z,sw,uuu bates snort.
Summing up, it may be said
that hay is the single important
exception to small yield of food
and feed crops. The farmer who
has to buy bread himself or grain
for his live stock within the next
twelve months fs going to have
to pay good prices for it.

GUARD AGAINST FIRES
AND CARRY INSURANCE.
Every citizen of Hickman and
farmers, too we believe, should
earry fire insurance -on his build
ings, but lie should not stop
there, lie should use every care
to guard against fires. Before
eold weather comes every stove
pipe, flue, chimney and fireplace
should be examined to see that
it is safe. Matches should be
kept out of the reach of chil
dren and rats. Open lights should
bt kept out of the barn and
smoking there strictly forbidden
by all persons. Gasoline should
be stored away from buildings.
Screens should be provided for
open fireplaces where children
stay or where sparks are likely
to fly out. A bucket of water
shonld be kejt handy if there is
no wntcr supply, &nd a chemical
fire eiiinguisher purchased and
hung up for convenient for use.
A little precaution is better
than a big fife.
And this ii fire season, you
now.
PAY DAY.
November first is always pay
day for my notes, accounts, etc.,
and I am sorry to. say some have
overlooked notes and accounts
due us. I have to collect to be
able to meet my. own obligations
and am going to ask you to come
forward at once and pay your
notes and accounts, otherwise they
will be placed in the hands of an
attorney for suit. With all farm
products bringing the prices they
are now, no one should ask for
extension. S. L. DODDS.
CUT OUT PASSES.
New Year's day will bring a
great many district and town offi
cials of Kentucky to a decision
whether they shall sacrifice the
privilege of riding free on the
railroads on the altar of public
service or abandon that service
at discretion.
Attorney General Logan .said
he is of the opinion that the law
clearly includes all these minor
officials, and though many, if
not most of them, are serving in
unsalaried capacities, they can
not , avail themselves of their
privileges as railroad employes to
ride on passes wiinoui incurring
the penaltyfor violating the law.
With more than the usual num
ber of farmers coming to Hick
man tius fall to market their
products and do their trading, the
lack cf hitch-racks proves to be a
great inconvenience to them. We
are to!3 there are some vacant
lots fcf West "Hickman that might
be used for hitching purposes, if
the city would provide the posts.

LITTLE TOT BREAKS ARM.
Little Freddie, five year old
son of Mr. and Mrs. F. M. Case,
broke his left arm Friday after
noon, while playing on a pile of
sacks containing cotton seed at
the depot. In short, he fell from
the pile, with the weight of his
body on his arm. Doctors Mc
Pheeters and Curlin rendered
medical assistance, and the little
fellow is getting along as nicely
as could le expected.
We notice some Hickman mer
chants are resuming the old prac
tice giving "lagniappes," which
for years lias been supplanted by
trading stamps and premium
schemes. The old plan doubtless
brings quickest results.

"A SAFE PLACE TO TRADE" '
MENGEL BOX CO. GIVES
EMPLOYES MORE WAGES.
Several hundred employes of
the Hickman branch of the Men
gel Box Co. were very pleasantly
surprised Saturday morning when
their pay envelopes contained an
extra five per cent,, representing
an unsolicited raise in wages of
that amount. In addition to ex
tra money, the "boys" were al
so tendered another little act of
kindness, which they certainly ap
preciate; viz, that the company
would furnish them coal at cost,
which will mean a big saving. As
a matter of fact, , the cos! situa
tion has been such tbat local
dealers were hard pressed in
supplying the trade, and Mengel '
merely comes to the rescue of its
employes.
Both Col. Claude Walker and
Frank Von Borries, the heads of
the local branch, are delighted
in being able to give their men
an increase in wages and the ad
vantage of coal at cost. While
none of them have ever asked.for
more wages, the branch managers
felt that the high cost of living
warranted an increase in wages
and proceeded with the Mengel
policy of doing the right thing at
the right time. While we are not
at liberty to give any exact fig
ures, we will state that this raise
in wages will amount tov many
thousands of dollars per year.
