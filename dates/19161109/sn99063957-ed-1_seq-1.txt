New York, Nov. . Chnrgeg thnthe
republican election officials in "New
Hampshire were unfair in the vote
count there, by which they gave the
state to Hughes by 101 votes, was made
today by Henry Alorgenthau, vhuirmnu
of the democratic finance committee.
"We will demand and pet a recount
there," lie said. "It will be very queer
if we cannot gain l.r0 or 200 votes in
this way. .The republicans control the
election machinery and it is only nat
ural that a recount would give us a gain

HAMPSHIR
AND
MINNESOTA
MAY HAVE TOUjrfD GERM
Chicago, Nov. 9. Discovery
of what muy prove to b the
gemmf infantile patalysis was
announced here by Dr. Moxi
luiliaii llerzog. If these experi
ments are supported by Inter
evidence, the conclusions of Dr.
Flexner or the Kockefeller In
stitute will be upset. The work
was done by Dr. Herzog as
head of the research committee
appointed by Dr. Jo b it Dill Rob
ertson here and his investiga
tion was carried on at the Cook
county hospital largely.
With fhe newly discovered
germ or coccus, Dr. Herzog has
produced the disease in-nionk-eys
and rabbits. It is possible
however that this germ is simp
ly the carrier of a smaller one,
which actually causes the dis
ease. Chairman Willcox
Still Refuses To
Concede Hughes Defeat
. . .
New York, Nov. P. "We will safe
guard our interestn in those sttaes,"
Willcox added to his earlier statement
regarding contests.
Asked if he still believed Hughes had
been elected, AVillcox said he did. He
said he had not discussed the question
with Hughes, but from the bitter's at
titude judged that the candidate nlso
still believed tbis. Willcox said h did
not contemplate mnkiui; any statement
tonight and did not plan to see Hughe
again.
. George W. Wickershnm, who was also
present at the conference, had no state
ment to make. Previously Everett Col

planned.
George W, Terkins was scheduled to

Student Suicided by
Electrical Route Today
1 Berkeley, Cal., Nov. 9. Kverett Wil
lis Morgan, aged 21, a junior at the
i. Diversity or California, was found
dead this afternoon, apparently electro
cuted by a bath robe he had electrically
w-ired. The case is puzzling the of-
iicers.
Morgan boarded at the home of a
member of the university, jind this
morning, ate breakfast with the family
When be failed to appear for luncheon,
an investigation resulted in his being
louna uenu in bed, wearing the bath
robe, which was connected by insulated
wire to an electric light socket.
As Mongrnn was studying for tho
ministry and waB to be married after
graduation, the -suicide theory is scout
ed. Morgan was the son of Thomas C.
Morgnn, a well known Berkeley and
I'tah mining man.
Suicide Discredited.
Eugene, Ore., Nov. 9. The theory
that Everett Willis Morgan, fouuil
deed iu an insulated bathrobe at Berke
ley, suicided, is discredited here by a
parallel case, in which Virgil Noland,
also a student, and member of the Uni
versity of Oregon .football team, was
dead in his bed after he donned a sim
ilarly wired bath robe to cure a cold.
This death occurred in 1911.

21,174 majority as a result of mistakes
iu the vote count having been discover
ed after 1,202 precincts had completed
A sudden gain by Wilson caused the

discovered the error. The fault was due
to nn old, unreliable I machine, Bryan
said. He stated he could not say posi
tively that the mistake announced was
really an error, but that he bad every
reason to believe it was. A second checK
is progressing in which the exact result
wilt be proved.

HIS PREDICTIONS
Classified the Vole Election
. Night and Apparently
' Correctly '
ROBERT W. WOOLLEY
Bobert W. Woolcy, chairmnd of the
democratic national publicity bureau, at
10:30 Tuesday night asserted in a form
al statement that Wilson will win with
300 electoral votes.
''Every western return now coining
in is favorable to the president," he
declared. "In the face of a tide set
against them for Hughes that the re
publicans asserted was a landslide, the
democratic leaders pointed out thai
with Ohio carried for Wilson there was
still a possibility that, the president
would be re-elected, despite loss ol
New York, Illinois, and Indiana, three
of the pivotal states.
"We are not stampeded bv tho wild
claims of the Hughes people," Wooley
said- "Remember 1892, when the re
publicans claimed a sweeping victory
and were theu compelled to revise the
statements when the late returns show
ed the election of Clveland."
Here are the figures Ohio not being
Considered as cited at democratic head
quarters: Wilson has the solid south Alabama,
Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana,
Mississippi, North Carolina, South Caro
lina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia a to
tal of latt votes.
Of the 531 votes in the electoral col
lege, 206 ere necessary for a choice.
Wilson thereiore has 140 .votes to gain
ufter the solid south.
Of the .191 votes remaining: after the
solid south is deducted from the elec
toral college total, Hughes, on the face
of returns at this hour, has carried. J
New lork, Indiana, Kanras, Conenc-
ticut, Iowa, Maine, New Hampshire.
Massachusetts, Vermont, New Jersey,
ichigan and Rhode Island a total of
56 votes. This, subtracted front 391, i
leaves 235 votes. From this, 235 Wilson '
must obtain 120 votes to add to his 140
from the solid south if he is to obtain
a majority of 206. To obtain this 126
votes Wilson would have to carry the
following -states claimed by Chairman
McCormick in his ante-election state
ment Colorado, Arizona, Kentucky,
Maryland, Missouri, Montana, Nebras

ton, and Wyoming a total of 107 votes

Wilson set in so strong in California and
Minnesota this afternoon that ti up-J
