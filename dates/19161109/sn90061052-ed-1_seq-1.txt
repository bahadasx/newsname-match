Wine Boys Write Home
C O Wine and wife received inter
esting letters last week from their sons
Robert and Charley who are among
the Missouri State Guards camped
along the Mexican border They write
of krog marches the wading of swollen
creeks and rivers waist deep and a few
little inconveniences like that They
say they have excellent quarters at
present and are generally very comfort
able
AVhile on sentry duty a few weeks
ago Robert fell into a rifle pit and broke
an arm The cast had just been re
moved when the letters were written
nnd the arm seems to have mended
properly Bob says he sure did wish
he was home the night he broke his
arm
Charley writes that the only view ho
had had of the inside of the guard
house he got while on guard duty
Jasper believes her boys will do
honor to themselves and the flag they
serve under and we are all glad to
know they are doing so well
