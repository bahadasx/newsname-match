la Baxter Springs Tuesday on
business. He comet frequently
and each trip falls more and more
in love with Baxter. It wouldn't
tale much right bow to induce
him to buy a residence property
and bnild a home here. Mr.
Skelton is heavily interested in
the .mining operations near
Baxter, having the first lease on
the Hocker property -on the state
line, 236 acres. Two forties of
the tract have been proven np
and are ready for. mining.
Shafts are being sank thereon
and mills are to be erected forth
with to be ready for operation
on the Kansas side by February
15, and on the Oklahoma side by
May 15.
Prospecting is still in progress
on this property and every drill
hole brings increasing proof of
the richness of the Baxter field.
On the Ball Frog property the
last drill quit 45 feat in rich ore.
The last hole on the Sunflower
property, on the Kansas side
averaged 38.90 per cent through
a 15 foot face of ore. The best
sample assayed 41.15 per cent.
The Pross Chubb land west of
the Mound, is being developed
by the Krnsnrian Miaing com
pany. They are down 100 feet
in the shaft. 'working, double
shift A mill will be erected here
early in the spring . This also is
proving a very rich deposit.
Surveying for Railroad.
The Southwest 'Missouri In
terurban Railroad company has
had a crew of surveyors at work
between the river at a point near
the mouth of the creek and Mil
tary street all this week. They
are taking levels for the purpose
of locating the road into Baxter.
The route appears to strike Sher
idan street west of the drtwTnd
to turn at Military street. No
information can be obtained, but
it is apparent that the plan is to
run down Military to a point
somewhere south of River street.
It is likely that the city council
will take action next Tuesday
night on the application of the
company for a franchise to run
through Baxter on the streets of
the city. It is well known that
this company will ask for no
bonus of any kind, seeking only
reasonable treatment here and
from the farmers in the matter
of right of way. In this respect
Baxter may be depended tipon to
do the fair-thing.

CuilJir &ad Loan Association
The Baxter Building, Saving
Sl Loan Association is proving to
be a mighty good thing for
Baxter. Not only does it furnish
a means for the man of small
cipital to get a. home of his own
snd psy for it. as he would pay
rent, but it provides a safe and
profitable investment for people
who have money not working.
The association is growing by
leaps and bounds. People are
voluntarily applying for shares
of stock, nearly 100 shares having
been sold during the last tea days.
.Applications for loans also are
coming is so fast the directors
are already put to their wits ends
for immediate funds with which
to meet the demand.' .
Building and loans associations
are safe investments. Every loan
must be secured by real estate
first mortgage. The Baxter as
sociation made its first loan last
July, and has already made a
sufficient number' of loans to
clear all expenses and is now
making money for its share
holders.
The Baxter association la pure
ly a cooperative community
interest which benefits both the
borrower and investor and also
the town. If you want to taveJ
if you want your savings to earn
money for you while you work,
while you sleep and while you
play, get as many shares of this
stock as von can. You know,
this is not a far away proposition
where you can only go by what
they tell you; it is a home prop
osition where yon can watch and
have a voice in the operations of
the company.
This lathe only savings plan
through which the people can
make a profit without first pro
viding for a big overhead expense
account Oily one man out of
ten men receives a dime for con
ducting the business. That is
the secretary and his salary ia
very small Baxter people with
money to invest will be wise to
..a m
pass up the far away mining
stocks, automobile stocks, etc.,
and -instead take on a few shares
of Baxter Building, Savings and
Loan association stock.

farm about two miles east of
Baxter Springs suffered the loss
of two or three hundred dollars

field of forage crop was burned.
The fire originated near the road

kindled by some one who threw a
lighted cigar from an automobile
into the dry grass at the road
side.
