IN SELF-DEFENSE. I
IC
Under a charge of murder, John
W. Minnick, 74 years of age, post- I
, master at Grand Isle for many years t
and a Confederate veteran, is lodged I
a behind the bars of the parish jail in I
d Gretna. He shot and' killed GastonI
Martin, 19 years old, Saturday, when
y it is alleged Martin attempted to kill
e him by shooting after Mr. Minnick
had charged Martin with being at
a negro. f
The tragedy was the result of l
Martin's brother's attentions toward M
tMiss Rose Kobolt, a school teacher, I
who has charge of the white chil- 1
dren's school at Grand Isle. Miss
Lt Kobolt's home is in Algiers. Shel
has been at Grand Isle since the <
school term began several weeks ago. ,
Someone took the information to
- Miss Kobolt that the Martins had ne- I
gro blood in their veins and she con
fronted them with the charge. They t
denied the statement and said they
would go to Mr. Minnick's home and
ask him. Mr. Minnick is said toI
have looked up the ancestry of all1
residents of the island, and is re
garded as an authority on the sub
ject.
Repdrt of Judge Lange, acting cor
oner of Grand Isle, Tuesday morn- i
ing, on the killing was that Martin
had come to his death by a gunshot I
wound niflicted to John W. Minnich.
At the conclusion of the report Mar-i
tin's color, concerning which the 1
shooting is alleged to have occurred, I
waA pronounced "white."

MRS. ANDREWS WRITES TO
TIMES-PICAYt'NE.
The Times-Picayune is in receipt
of a pathetic letter from Mrs. Jo
seph Andrews, of 422 Belleville
street, whose husband was a mem
ber of the L. Edward Hines crew.
The letter is as follows:
"New Orleans, La.-Algiers.
"To the Editor of The Times-Pica
yune:
"Dear Sir-In my distress, I ap
peal to you for assistance in an ef
fort as a last hope to obtain some
news of my husband, Joseph An
drews, one of the crew of the ill
fated steamship L. Edward Hines.
My idea is that a publication of a re
quest in your paper, that ships tra
veling in the vicinity of the disaster
keep a lookout for survivors not ac
counted for, may result in some fa
vorable news.
'"The fact that Mr. Andrews was
one of the crew of the L. Edward
Hines was not generally known, as
he had Just signed on her a daf or
two before sailing on that unfortu
nate trip. As he was a native of
New Orleans and well known to sea
faring men in this section, the pub
lication in your paper may lead to
some good news, or at least may in
terest his friends on ships plying in
the vicinity of the disaster to make
inquiries concerning him and in such
event of news, to communicate with
his wife.
"Trusting that you may grant my
request, I beg to remain, anxiously.
"MIRS. JOSEPH ANDREWS,
"422 Belleville street."
