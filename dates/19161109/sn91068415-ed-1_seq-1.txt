Never was there such agony over
an election in the history of the
country. Neither democrats or re
nublicans Know how it is going. It
is so close at this writing (two days
after the election was held) that it
is hazardous to make a safe guess.
All day Wednesday it looked like
Vilson, a vast difference between
the night before when it looked very
much like Hughes, in fact his elec
tion was almost conceded. The re
sult from the vote Wednesday show
ed Wilson in the lead and this morn
ing early Hughes was. credited with
239 and Wilson 232 in the electoral
college with 60 votes doubtful. By
9 o'clock.the vote had shifted to 252
for Wilson and every hour or so
Thursday until the time this was
written the vote changed, each side
claiming the election. The demo
crats have challenged the vote of
New Hampshire which their
manager says went for Wilson while
the republicans cf cum ii qsu.
row margin of 161.'"' "
The vote of West Virginia is also
uncertain and a close watch is kept
over it. The other doubtful states
are California, Minnesota. Nebraska
New Mexico, North Dakota and
Washington with 56 votes, although
Nebraska and California are practic
allo conceded to the democrats.
Idaho also leans strongly to Presi
dent Wilson, and in Minnesota the
Wilson vote has diminished but he
still has a small lead.
President Wilson says he is confi
dent at this hour that he has been
elected.
Never did a more loyal crowd
stick to Wilson like big brothers than
did the democrats, here they were
vitally interested in the outcome
and remained on the streets day
and night trying to get some word
of encouragement. Of course the
republicans were also interested in
their man but the sureness with
which they calculated victory on
Tuesday night, was vastly different
Wednesday and Thursday because j
the race had narrowed down to
an j
uncertainty.
"All day long and far into the
night the question -went up trom lip
to lip. "what abbuVth election?"
The feeling of " hope and vic
tory, of uncertainty aud defeat arose
and fell alike in the hearts of the
populace. ' .
It was a time that-tried men s
souls a great and wearing suspense
that would not pass away until the
fateful momont when the official
count was given. .
Wednesday morning most of the
city papers carried pictures of
Hughes as the winner but they may
have to substitute Wilson yet. '
The Review held this issue with the hope
of announcing the winner but as it may be
another day before we know for sure in just
ice our readers and advertisers had to go to
to press Thursday afternooon
THE PITY OF IT ALL
Never was there such , an election
before, never so much interest and
as one democrat remarked "It would
6e a shame to boost our man as a
winner at the eleventh hour and
have him go down i a defeat. It is
like killing a man twice." It's a
Pity both sides can't win, isn't it?

W. G. Brown and A. M. Idol are
the only democratic magistrates in
the city, having been appointed
about one year ago by the governor
for a term of six years.
.Alihough there were hundreds of
voters congregated around the poll
ing places throughout the day and
many of them, through time limita
tion, were unable to cast their vote,
very good order prevailed. There
were 2482 voters registered and
there were but four polling places.
Just 623 minutes were available for
voting purposes, making it essential
that at least one High Pointer cast
his ballot each minute.
Early returns in this county look
ed like the republicans stood a good
chance to get the register of deeds
and treasurer but they remain demo
cratic, the party making a clean
sweep, but with a reduced majority.

Excitement and Enthusiasm
Intense
All day long Wednesday the phone
kept ringing and people kept calling
at The Review office to learn who
was elected president. When the
tide turned so Strongly to Wilson
after midnight Tuesday and. the
official vote held in abeyance until
Wednesday night the people were
intensely interested and excited over
the prospects of a Wilson victory.
We have never seen anything like
it, the very air around you was
surcharged with electrical political
current and remained so for 48
hours.
WILSON ELECTED BY NORMAL
STUDENTS
"He kept us out of the war" help
ed to elect Wilson by a large majori
ty in the voting of the students of
the State Normal college Tuesday.
The large body of young women of
the state assembled there, 725 of
them had demonstrations on the
campus Tuesday for both Democra
tic and Republican candidates and
also a suffrage demonstration. After
the voting, contrary to the proce
dure of mere men, the campaign
speeches were made in Curry court.
The vote for Wilson was 538 and
for Hughes, 67.
C. E. Wagner, the popular
manager of the Broadway for the
past year , has severed his connection

Let lis Sell tfie Weed
In all probability High Point will
establish a tobacco market in time
to .take care; of the yellow leaf by
nekt season. This city at one time
was a fine1 market for the weed The
editor can - remember when there
were; two warenouses, running at
fullpeed, the Anchor and the Pied
mont and each day during the sea
son fiad great drives of tobacco. In
fact:this at one time was the center
of a great tobacco region and could
be made so again. With the going
out of business of the Pickett and
Jenkins tobacco factories the sale of
the leaf was stopped and the ware
houses closed and used for other
put poses, but this should not be the
case. The Central Garage is locat
ed in the old Anchor warehouse,
and this would now make an ad
mirable place for the sale of the leaf
and doubtless could be secured. YesJ
let us establish the market by all
-uetms.

when tfie pictures of Wilson and
Hughes .were thrown upon the white
canvas pandemonium, broke loose
and this happened at least 100 times
during the night We used nearly
twelve hundred slides during the six
hours which is a little better than a
slide every twenty seconds. It took
work, hard and fast work. to accom
plish bis butit,won;and the
great throng seemed pleased in fact
they said so with a mighty shout
when the question was asked and
scores of people; have called and
stopped us, on the streets to com
pliment us on the excellent service.
When you have to write a slide every
twenty seconds (scratch the word
ing with a steel pencil on a painted
j glass) and make it so it could be
read the reader can see what a diffi
cult job it is: But we had every
thing arranged to a nicety- one per
son handed the slides to the opera
tor, another took them', from the
m achine; a boy was repainting the
used slides and everything was mov
ing like clock work-not a hitch to
mar the whole affair.
The editor assisted by J. S. Peel
of the Atlantic Sales Co., wrote the
slides, Fred Walker presided at. the
telephone in an admirable manner
and got the nearby returns; the
Western Union furnished the tele
graph dope fast and hot, the North
State Telephone Company gave us
right of way over its excellent sys
tem, R. P. Parker of the Atlantic
Sales Co., and Paul Stamey used
the megaphone, Will McSparran
presided at the machine, assisted by
Messers. Myatt and ProWn, and here
was the system that won v out " and
drew a crowd that blocked Main
street from the railroad crossing al
most to the Home Banking Co. corn
er and over run the near by stores.!
And there were many ladies in the
crowd too.
The crowd composed of people
from every walk of life took things
good naturedly as flash after flash
on the huge screen told of the re
sult pf the heavy ballot of the day.
The fact that ihe people were able
to read the bulletins at once owing
to their clearness dianot call for
the use of the megaphone - as often
as was expected (in order to give
those not so well versed in letters a
chance to learn) because the crowd
went wild with what they read many
times before the megaphone would
read the wording on the bulletin
board. . , ; :
We are under obligations to all
who contributed to this superb ser
vice, the Rose theatre, J. L. Kirk

Messers . Peel and Parker, McSpar-'
