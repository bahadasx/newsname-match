agency in the country, and has
never in its history made an in

therefore, is certain beyond all

of victory that Chairman Mo
Committee has sent President
Wilson a. telegram congratu
lating him upon his election.
According to news received
by the Commercial just before
this issue is placed upon the
streets, Wall Street has conced
ed a victory for the Demc
crats, and this looks very fa
orable. as President Wilson
was bitterly opposed by finarr
ciers penerally, and the fact
that his election has been con
ceded in a district which is rec
ognized ns the financial center
of the country indicates posi
tively and conclusively that he
wiH succeed himself as Presi
dent cf the United States.
After having hovered, perilously
near defeat in the national election
Tuesday, the Democrats made appre
ciable trains on the home stretch,
and from the latest returns avail-
the most cumbersome ballot that has
ever been presented to a Mississippi
electorate to handle or election of
ficers to count and tabulate, has been
received at the state capitol. The
people of Jackson, as well as of ev
ery other center in the state, have
been concerned over the general re
sults throughout the country. They
know that the Democratic electoral

for the combined Republican, So
cialist and Progressive.
It is furthermore assured that John
Sharp Williams has received a hand
some indorsement for United States
senator, and that the eight Democra
tic congressmen have been re-elected.
The most interesting question pre
sented is as to the fate of the state
?ame and fish law under the referen
dum vote which was taken. So far
as received, here up to a late hour
tonight, the figures indicate that the
law has been decisively beaten. Tak
;rg the vote' of Hinds county, so far
as reports are to hand, the result
has been almost two to one against
Una law. The majority against the
law so far as learned is 244 votes.

tinued to be discouraging up to mid
night, when its character suddenly
changed and the gleam of hope for
Wilson appeared on the horizon.
Among the first. favorable news was
a dispatch stating that the Demo
crats were steadly gaining in Cali

a Ropublician stronghold, and when
Columbians learned that it was

" Jackson, Miss., Nov. 8. Suits to
collect back taxes aggregating al
most $4,000,000 filed by J. Johnston,
former state revenue agent, against
cotton buyers and merchants in the
principal cities of Mississippi, were
thrown out of court by a decision of
the supreme court Monday sustain
ing the legality of an act passed by
the last legislature ordering abate
ment of the litigation. The suits
have been pending about two years
and sought to collect back taxes cov
ering a period of six years on cotton
on hand Feb. 1 each year. The
court held the legislature had au
thority to abate litigation of the
character instituted by a state of
ficial. The act was what is known as the
Hemphill act, the purpose of which
was to direct the abatement of suits
or claims filed by the revenue agent
against a large number of cotton
buying firms throughout the state
for back taxes on cotton held after
Feb. 1 during a period of six years.
This opinion does not deny the right
of the revenue agent to take steps
to recover back assessments proper
ly due and collectible. It merely de
cides that the legislature was entirely
within its right and prerogative in
passing Senate Bill 310, and that the
said act is not in conflict with the
constitution.
Incidentally, it will have the effect
of dismissing suits against a large
number of cotton buyers throughout
the state on cotton held aggregating
some $4,000,000 or $5,000,000 which
if pressed to a conclusion and sus
tained, would bankrupt a number of
