SUBSCRIPTION: $1.50 PER YEAR IN ADVANCE
So far at least as Supt. Hinton
is concerned the complaints that
he has made discriminations in
making the big- payment may not
be justified, but that there was
gross discrimination cannot be de
nied. As an illustration the fol
lowing cases are referred to:
Payments were refused to Joseph
E. Perrault, justice of the pence
and formerly a clerk for years in
\the government service, and also
to Joseph Charrette, an old soldier
of the civil war who receives thirty
dollars per month pension, is a
man of strictly temperate habits
and as president of the local coun
cil of White Earth Reservation is
one of the most prominent men of
the reservation, and likewise to
Mrs. Mary English, a highly edu
cated and cultivated woman whose
character is without a blemish. On
the "other han3 tfred Jackson, wfio
is a notorious warehouser and
whiskey drinker received his pay
ment and likewise Joseph Meshow
and wife, who are both in the
habit of becoming intoxicated and
who since they received their per
capita share of the big payment
have been at Detroit where, it is
reported, they have been on a
spree since the payment was made
to them. There are also numer
ous others who have been paid
who are warehouses and drinking
men but who were favorites of the
Howard regime.
Jt is reported that even some of
the successful farmers of Callaway
and Richwood did not receive their
payments, at least this is the state
mentby George Campbell which
was made by him to the represen
tative of TH E TOMAHAWK.
There is no justification in the
with-holding of the payments of
Joseph Charrette, Joseph Per
rault and Mrs. English, and it has
only resulted in their humiliation.
Mr. Charrette was too mortilied
to make any complaint and we are
informed that he retured to his
home without even mentioning the
subject to anyone but to two of his
most intimate friends. But Mr.
jPerrault has openly expressed his
indignation and has carried the
matter up to the Indian office at
Washington, and he says that if he
does not receive proper treatment
there be will is necessary appeal
to higher authority.
There seems to be a preconcert
ed plan to discredit Mr. Perrault
to the Indian office at Washington
so that his application for a posi-

Justified.
at the agency office here may
not be considered. If it is true
that the AgeDcy is trying to dis
credit Mr. Perrault by not paying
him the funds to which he is en
titled and to thus give the impres
sion that he is incompetent, those
who are responsible for this should
be dismissed from the service.
It is enough that the law of- last
May, which Congress passed giv
ins membera ot the Chippewa of
Defective Page
Minnesota bands the preference as
em pi yes in the Chippewa Indian
service, is ignored instead of do
ing further injury by taking such
action against an applicant for a
position as will cause him to be
discredited.
If Mr. Hinton is not to blame
and if any member of his office
force is, he should be invegti

ing Efforts to Have
Law Enforced.
As a preliminary step towards
having existing laws relative to
Chippewa interests enforced, es
pecially the one passed by Con
gress to give the Chippewas pre
ference as employees in the Chip
pewa Indian service ia Minnesota,
a subscription list asking for do
nations to employ a Washington
attorney to mandamus the officials
of the Interior Department there
to observe the law is being circu
lated.
It is suggested that a committee
of person? who are interested
should take hold of the matter of
raising funds, and if necessary an
effort should be made to get up a
basket ball and raise funds in this
way. In cases of emergency the
ladies of White Earth can always
be relied upon to do things, and
an appeal should be made to them
to get up a basket ball.
There are many educated young
men and women who desire em
ployment who should

the superintendent here and the
Indian office, but they should
carry their applications into the
courts if necessary.
Pays His Salary?
John R. Howard, ex-superin
tendent, is now employed in a sub
ordinate capacity, in a position in
fact formerly heid by Mr. Carr, of
examining lands.
So far as his employment is con
cerned it is of no benefit to the
Chippewas of Minnesota, and it
does not concern them generally if
Howard's salary does not come out
of Chippewa tribal funds, but if it
comes out of this fund they should
be interested to the extent of mak
ing a protest against such an un
lawful expenditure of the fund.
Congress made an appropriation
of 8185,000 last May for the "Re-
lief and Civilization of the Chippe
wa Indians in Minnesota'' but it
would be impossible for the Indian
office at Washington to construe
the law as being applicable to the
employment of Howard and to
pay him from tribal funds to ap
praise the value of lands sold by
individual Indians.
It is the general impression that
Howard is being paid from Chip
pewa tribal funds. If such is the
case the matter should be submit
ted to the courts together with
numerous other positions that are
being paid from tribal funds in
order to test the validity of a far
fetched construction by the Indian
office.
ged Indian Granted Pen
sion After Fifty Years
Of Waiting.
Ashland, Wis., Nov. 5.Pen-
sion No 1,421,844.
To the casual observer there
figures would be of no more than
pa&sing interest, but to one who is
''W1'
acquainted with the bit of history
I which surrounds them, they por
tray an interesting phase of the
I character of the Indian of the old
jer type, and the kindly disposition
of the red man towards an un
fortunate brother during seven
long yens of waiting.
Louis O.-saw^h, a Chippewa In
dian of Odanah, now known as
Louis Sky. who served in the v/ar
of the rebellion as a private in Co.
'II F.fth Regiment Wisconsin
infantry, has been awarded a pen
sion in his old age that he should
have been drawing since the close
of the Civil war.
In the year 1909, Dan Cameron,
a Chippewa Indian of Odanah,
called at a local law office and
asked to have a pension claim
started for an old Indian, who had
lost his mind, and was destitute
and sick. Cameron engaged a
team and took one of the law firm
to Odanah, where an old man was
found who did not know his name
did not know the members of his
family did not know his age in
fact he had had an entire lapse of
memory for a great many years.
He, however, did know that he
had been a soldier in the war of
the rebellion, and gave certain
names which have since been
recognized as those of soldiers in
his organization.
Major Campbell was appealed to
and upon the little information
Dan Cameron could get from the
old Indian letters were written to
different localities and to different
departments of the government
ajid state. Finally with the aid of
a* few old settlers, prominent
among whom Were Thomas Bardon
of Ashland, Wis., and his brother,
James Bardon, of Superior, Wis.,
the Indian was identified as one
sometimes called ui Manitons
sometimes called Ossawah, and
sometimes called Sky. Generally
these liter years called and known
to the Indians upon the Bad River
reservation as Louis Sky.
Lieut. H. L. Farr, of Madison,
Wis., the one remaining officer of
the company, said that this man
was always an excellent soldier
especially recognized as a sharp
shooter and choseu for work of
great daring and courage that
there were five other Indians in
the army, and their custom while
in the service was to tent together
and remain together a great deal
of the time.
Lieut. Farr wrote that he felt
conlident if he could see this man,
whose name had been given in so
many ways, sometimes called Louis
Ahsiwah, again called Louis Ab
swewah, but for convenience sake
apparently in the army, known as
Louis Ossawah, he would recog
nize him.
His pension was granted to him
under the, name of Louis Ossawah,
now called Louis Sky, and will
date from the time his formal ap
plication was made, Nov. 26, 1915,
and at the rate of $22- 50 per
month.Ex.

W/j/te Earth, Becker County, Minnesota, Thursday, November 9. 1916.
Rufus Choate "backed otf the
stage" for riotous handwriting
and now that a quiet, serene Sun
day has intervened since the trio
mentioned have exclusively oc
cupied my thoughts, I can ptck up
the thread of discourse and pro
ceed to tell all about La Pointe.
I was yet upon the wave when
later writing descriptively.
As we "plowed the deep" the
atmosphere began to have its in
tiuence and I began to feel myself
the sailor, and expected when
landed to exhibit the sailors "sea
legs," and roll in my gait. Noth
ing of the kind occurred, our little
boat rounded in true ship fashion
as we approached the dock and
landed sidewise. The steersman
now became the common sailor,
and stepped out of the boat to the
pier with cable in hand. There
was no romance in him, he snubbed
the boat to a hitching post as
though the craft were a raft and
the passengers its degenerate
crew.
We got out without eclat, no
friends met us with waving hand
kerchiefs for we simply came from
Bayfield and not from Liverpool
or Bremen.

was below the level of the dock,
and this effort on my part strained
my aged limbs so that my gait
was slightly limping and not "roll-
ing."
But though I Had not an "Anci
cent Mariner's" gait I did have
some thoughts of the past as my
feet touched the level of the dock,
for this dock is old and had as
sociations for me.

dock so oft repaired as to have no
more in its being any of the ma
terial of original construction, was
psychalogically, the old American
Fur Co. dock. It was in the same
old place and beached itself at the
same old shorj. As I stood still
for a moment and looked about, 1
could in my mind's eye see the
roof and sides of the greater part
of the construction and which in
days of old, constituted a fish
warehouse as well as a dock for
shipping.
Visions came to me of the oc
casional steamer the Julia Palmer
which docked here, the regular
Company schooner the Siskowt,
which with a roving commission
plied constantly upon the waters
of the lakes, and even up the St.
Louis River to the trading post at
Fond du Lac, the headquarters of
the Fond du-Lac department. In
those days it was a post of import
ance, and Ah sah geeng (place of
outlet), and was nothing but a
wilderness, though today it is Du
luth.
And there I could, as I stood
upon the dock, mentally see the
fleet of Mackinaw boat,-, or the
single one, also the "Canoes a
liege," the large birch barkers of
the lakes. I could see merchan
dise from below unloaded in bulk,
and see also the same rearranged
for portage transportation in bales
weighing about 75 lbs., loaded
again into Mackinaw boats or lake
canoes destined for the island. 1
could also see the crews departing
for the fishing grounds, and their
return with the take salted, and

And then as the sense of hear
ing has memories, 1 heard again
the voices of out going and in
coming voyageurs, the "Mangeuns
delurd"'or pork eaters, also of
their sons the "Metis" or mixed
blood voyageurs and fishermen.
And the languages reheard were
the French and the Chippewa,
sometimes commingled by the
mixed bloods.
There were "Sapres" and "Tah
yahs" and all was musical to tho
ear engaged in retrospections.
Names came back to me, I
thought of the Neveux, the Bris
etles, the Souvernins, the St.
Johns, the Cardinals and many
others whose names are not per
petuated within the circle ot Min
nesota Chippewas. And then I
picked up myself as it were and
proceeded up hill and began to see
the old Company warehouse and
fur house on the right and the dry
goods house and retail store on the
left, and reaching the brow of the
little ascent I saw straight ahead
the manager's office, and right and
left clerks quarters, and those of
sub employees, and the summer
dwellings of voyageurs and fisher
men.
1 saw also the grassy lawn be
tween residences and business
buildings, the alleys, and the high
picketed company garden for tho
