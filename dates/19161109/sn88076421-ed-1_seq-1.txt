FEW MOTOR CMS
SIW Ft WINTER
Dodge Brothers Enclosed Conveyances
Good in Any Weather—Pleasure
of Winter Motoring.
The "stored for winter" tag on mo­
tor cars will be less in evidence thru
cut the country this year than ever be­
fore, according to the Mr. Fuller, of
the McKinney-Fuller Motor Co., deal­
ers in Dodge Brothers cars in this city.
There are several reasons, he says.
One is the unparalleled business activ­
ity now in prospect, which will require
incessant use of the automobile for
business men. Another is the growing
impression that "the motor car made
these days is good enough in any wea­
ther." Still another, and perhaps more
important, is the development of win­
ter cars to the point where cost no
longer conflicts with comfort.
In other words, the time has arrived
when the average motor car owner
will not hesitate between shivering
through the winter in an open convey­
ance, or investing in year-around-com
fort by buying a winter car. The mo
troist has come to regard it as an ac­
tual economy. Tucked away in the
warmth of an enclosed car on his way
to the office, he no longer finds it nec­
essary to devote the first half hour of
his working time to "warming up."
As one has put it: "I find wholesome
pleasure even in defying the blustery
winds it puts me in a good mood for
the morning."
Due to conditions such as these as
well as the criterion afforded by the
heavy sales of last year, Dodge Broth­
ers' dealers are preparing for an ex­
ceptional demand. They are now in a
position to supply snug winter cars
both of the touring and roadster type.
Slight alterations in the style used
last year make it even more desirable,
both from the standpoint of taste and
comfort. The interior is handsomely
upholstered in grey and both the road­
ster and touring car are fitted with a
dome light of a pleasant glow. Doors
fit tightly but open easily and rattling
is minimized by exactness of construc­
tion. One of the most attractive fea­
tures of the Dodge Brothers' winter
car is the fact that the winter top may
be removed without difficulty, thereby
affording an ideal conveyance for use
the year around. Also, by purchasing
a winter top, with which the local
dealer is now supplied, any owner of a
Dodge Brothers' touring par or road­
ster may easily convert his last sum­
mer's automobile into a dignified, com­
fortable closed car ready to cope with
the worst of weather.
TOWN CRIERS CLUB TO HAVE
A RESEARCH COMMITTEE
President C. E. DeNoon of the Mi­
not Town Criers Club, has appointed
the following committee to collect data
relative to conditions of affairs in the
city of Minot regarding industrial af­
fairs: B. N. Lesk, Chairman A. H.
Kurth, C. L. Crandall, Jas. Smallwood,
Jr., K. A. Morgan and A. F. Bacon.
This committee was appointed at the
behest of the National Research Com­
mittee of the Associated Advertising
Clubs of the World. While the func­
tions of the local committee are lim­
ited to a certain extent it has been
thought wise for the members to se­
cure as complete a survey of the city
as possible, so that during the coming
year all inquiries can be answered
truthfully and completely. This data
will be at the disposal of the Associa­
tion of Commerce, as well as the Town
Criers Club.
Members of the committee will start
at once on their work, and every busi­
ness firm in the city is requested to
assist them as much as possible. Much
of a confidential nature will be asked
for, but none of the statistics obtain­
ed will be used singly, but will be
totaled, and the original blanks de­
stroyed.
Minot is surely taking its proper
place among the cities of the country,
and a business survey is a necessity
every year from now on.
MRS. JOSEPH FLEMMING
PASSES AWAY SUDDENLY
Popular Foxholm Woman Called to the
Great Beyond Sunday Night Fol­
lowing Birth of Child
Mrs. Joseph Flemming, wife of a
well known farmer residing eight
miles southwest of Foxholm, passed
away at 10:30 o'clock Sunday night,
following the birth of a babe born four
hours before and the babe also died.
The family physician and members of
the family were at the bedside when
death came. Mrs. Flemming's death
was quite unexpected and has cast a
shadow of gloom within the family
circle and among the many friends.
The funeral was .held Thursday
morning at 10 o'clock from St. Henry's
Catholic church, interment being made
in the St. Henry's cemetery. The
Weinrebe Undertaking establishment
of this city had charge of the funeral.
Mrs. Flemming is survived by her
husband and five children, as follows:
Agnes, 17 John, 16 Phillip, 12 Mary.
10, and Leonard, 8. One child, a babe
of 14 months, died Sept. 12, 1915.
Mrs. Flemming, who was Antonio
Zabeck, was bom in Germany 39 years
ago and when a child of but two years
accompanied her parents to Rosens,
Minn. Here she was married to Jos.
Flemming 18 years ago the first of
October, and 11 years ago the Flem-
rrings moved to Ward county. Her
mother preceded her to the Great Be­
yond, but her father resides at Falsen,
N. D. She is survived by a sister, who
lives in Brauerville, Minn., and four
brothers: John Zabeck of Minot Mar­
tin Zabeck, Foxholm Leo Zabeck, Fal­
sen, and Ed Zabeck, Big Stone, S. D.
Mrs. Flemming was a woman beloved
by all and the family have the sincer
est sympathy of a host of friends.

ELECTION
WERE RECEIVED BY
THE INDEPENDENT
Tuesday Night's Service Gave This
Office Most Complete Election
Returns in the City
The Independent office was the mec
ca for hundreds of weary political so­
journers Tuesday evening, interested
in learning the results of election.
Manager McGuire of the Northern
States Power Co. very kindly installed
a wire at our office in the afternoon,
connecting with the long distance tel­
ephone service with the east, enabling
us to get frequent returns from all
sections of North Dakota as well as
from every state in the Union. County,
state and national returns were tabu­
lated and in that way around the mid­
night hour, or before, we were enabled
to give fairly reliable results, except
in the case of the presidency. During
the early part of the evening, when it
was learned that New York, the New
England states, New Jersey, Wilson's
home state, Illinois and other states
had gone for Hughes, it appeared cer­
tain that our next president would be
a republican. At 2 o'clock in the morn­
ing, after the rural returns had begun
coming in, it was learned that the two
candidates were running neck and
neck and so close were the results that
it was realized at once that it would
be a day or two before the result of
the great fight would be fully deter­
mined.
The Independent furnished election
news from ten of the counties of the
state to the Grand Forks Herald and
in return secured results from every
other section of the state, and the
United States, giving this paper the
most complete election returns ever
received in Minot. We were also in
touch with the direct wire to Minneap­
olis, installed by the Western Union in
the Temple Court Cigar Store, where
large crowds gathered, remaining un­
til early morning. Lewis & Co., grain
merchants, also received returns over
their direct wire.
Thousands of people from outside
of the city visited Minot and remained
during the night, showing unusual in­
terest in the returns.
During the night our friends in the
country and in the surrounding towns
received the returns by wire from the
Independent office, several hundred
phone calls being answered during the
night.
PETER VANDENOEVER
RE-ELECTED COUNTY
ISSII
THE WARD COUNTY INDEPENDENT
Present Incumbent From the First De­
feats John Ehr, Democratic
Candidate in Election
Peter Vandenoever, commissioner
from the First district, was re-elected
by defeating John Ehr, the democratic
nominee. Vandenoever at this writ­
ing is 99 votes in the lead with the sec­
ond ward to hear from. He is ahead
in every ward heard from except the
"bloody eighth," where Ehr leads him
by 39 votes. This was an unusually
interesting fight, inasmuch as the can­
didates are among Minot's very best
business men and both men deservedly
popular.
JUDGE LEIGHTON RE-ELECTED
Judge of the Eighth Judicial District
Defeats F. B. Lambert in Inter­
esting Contest.
K. E. Leighton, Judge of the Eighth
Judicial District, was re-elected by an
overwhelming majority over his op­
ponent, Atty. F. B. Lambert of Minot.
While the returns are not all in, the
judge has been re-elected by fully two
to one.
With returns from 33 out of 35 pre­
cincts in Ward county, Leighton gets
S85 and Lambert 396. Reports from
Renville and Burke counties show that
Leighton is running about two to onj
and practically as strong in Ward
county.
Long Job Counting Votes.
The judges of election in the Second
Ward, Minot, started work Tuesday
morning at 8 o'clock and at the close
of the polls that afternoon at 5 o'clock,
they started counting the ballots. They
did not complete their work until after
midnight this (Thursday) morning,
and one of them, Frank Slatky, de­
clares that he surely earned his
money.
JUDGE POLLOCK DEFEATED.
Judge Pollock of Fargo was defeat­
ed by A. T. Cole, carrying not only the
city of Fargo but the district. Judge
Pollock is an old time jurist and one of
the best known judges in North Da­
kota.

HOME OF JOHN J. LEE
John J. Lee, one of Ward county's
progressive farmers, owns a valuable
farm home five miles north of Minot.
It is well improved and Mr. Lee says
that he would not take $65 an acre
for the land. Mr. Lee says that he
values his land at around $100 an acre
and should he care to sell, it would be
lout a few years before he could get
this price. He is living on his fath­
er's old homestead, which was taken
up about 30 years ago. He has 560
acres in two farms. His barn is
74x56. Mr. Lee keeps 35 head of cat­
tle on his farm and raises brome grass
for pasture and timothy for hay. He
usually grows a good sized field of
corn. Mr. Lee has been very success­
ful with his cows. He is now milking?
14 cows and during the past year, he
has averaged $175 per cow, selling'
cream. He has supplied the Balerud

Democrats Carry County
Dakota, and at present United State
Treasurer, by a large majority, esti­
mated at 17,000. Burke, who is con­
sidered to be the greatest campaigner
among North Dakota democrats, made
a decidedly weak showing. Ward
county gave Burke a fair majority.
Frazier Governor
Lynn J. Frazier, the Hoople farmer
and nonpartisan league republican can­
didate, was elected governor of North
Dakota, defeating McArthur, demo­
crat, by an overwhelming majority. In
Ward county he ran nearly three to
one.
John Steen Defeated
John Steen, state treasurer, was de­
feated by the nonpartisan league can­
didate, Casey. In Ward county Casey
has a lead of more than 400. Ward
county gave all of the other nonparti­
san league candidates great majorities
over their opponents, the candidates
for the supreme court receiving the
endorsement getting the most votes.
Leighton Majority
Ward county gave Leighton a ma­
jority of over 800 votes over Lambert
for district judge.
Nonpartisan Representatives
Anthony Walton, J. E. Erb, H. R.
Wood and George Reishus, republican
candidates for the legislature from the
29th district, received such majorities
that, interest was lost in their election
very shortly after the polls closed. J.
H. jj(«rns, the Surrey blacksmith, and
Hans Christenson, the democratic can­
didates, received very good endorse­
ments, but not nearly enough votes to
elect them.
Nedreloe Re-elected

past five years.
Mr. Lee has just installed a 65 volt
electric light plant on his farm, fur­
nishing light for every room in the
house, and all of his barns, granaries,
etc. The plant was installed by John
Anderson, who has had considerable
success in this work.
Mr. Lee is married and has four
children. Mrs. Lee is regarded as
equally as good a manager as her hus­
band and deserves a good share of ths
credit for their success.
Mr. Lee believes in diversified farm­
ing. He not only raises considerable
stock but he farms 400 acres of land.
A year ago he marketed 8,000 bushels
of grain but this year he raised but
2,000 bushels. Still, his cows pay all
expenses and he can get along nicely
even tho he does not sell a bushel of
grain.

Nedreloe, Ward county's present sher­
iff, and Dan Dougherty, Minot's chief

reloe received between two and three
hundred votes more than Dougherty.
Bond Defeated
One of the most interesting contests
was that for senator. Walter Bond,
the present senator, was defeated by
Thorwald Mostad, democrat, who had
received the endorsement of the non­
partisan league. Mostad received near­
ly 400 more votes than Bond.
The following are the totals for
some of the offices, with all returns in

Wilson carried Ward county over
Hughes by more than a thousand votes
