fiftieth mile stone in their mar
ried life, and the event was cele
brated by a number of their child
ren, grandchildren and friends
gathering at their home at Wells
Tannery. The day was very
pleasantly spent, and the table
fairly groaned under its weight
of good things and their friends
left wishing them many happy
years to come. They received
many beautiful and useful pres
ents. Mr. and Mrs. Swope are the
parents of eleven children and
their family circle was unbroken

Thrown from Buggy.
Last Tuesday, as James Con
nelly, rear Dane, was driving in
East Extension, a parsing auto
caused the horse to turn sudden
ly across the road with the result
that James was thrown out of the
buggy, alighting on the side of
his head and face causing ugly
cuts and bruises. C. W. Morgan,
a member of the railraad con
struction gang, was riding with
Connelly and helped the latter to
drive the captured horse to Dr.
Robin son's c ffice where surgical
aid was rendered.
De Lost Bis Tarlcys.
Andrew Brant, of Taylor town
ship, without mentioning any
names, told the editor a few days
ago that somebody is eating more
turkey this fall than he, and that
he is doing it at Andy's expense.
The thirteenth turkey was stolen
last Sunday a fine gobbler worth
between five and six dollars.
This brought the veteran turkey
raiser's wrath to white heat, and
if something don't "drap" out
there, we are badly mistaken.
8 o'clock, Thursday evening, No
vember 2, 1916, after one week's
illness of pneumonia.
Mrs. Adams was the only
daughter of the late Thomas Hor
ton, and she was born at Lang

was aged 58 years, 4 months and
13 days. She was married to
George W. Adams about fifteen
years ago, who preceded her to
the other world just seven weeks
to the day.

ter, of Hancock, Md., and by the
following children: G. Brice, of
Wells Tannery; George, of Ebons
burg; William, of Wells Tannery;
Thomas, of Saxton; and Miss Ce
celia Horton, of Portage, Pa. ; al
so, by eleven grandchildren and
a host of friends, who will miss
"Lile" as she was lovingly known
by her friends for she was a
friend to every one especially, a
great favorite among the child
ren in the neighborhood.
Her remains were placed in the
Presbyterian cemetery beside
those of her late husband last
Saturday afternoon, Dr. Dalling,
of Everett, preaching the funeral
sermon in the church at Wells
Tannery. s
NOTICE TO
On account of the great advance in the price of paper, inks,
type, labor and everything else connected with the publishing of a
newspaper, the subscription price of the Fulton County News
will be $1.50 a year on and after December 20, 1916. When the
Fulton Democrat and the Fulton Republican were fir3t established
away back in the early 50's the subscription price was $2.50 a year,
and the size was not one-half the size of the present Fulton county
papers. The price was afterwards reduced to $2.00 a year and later
to $1.50. The price remained at $1.50 until seventeen years ago,
when the publisher of the Fulton County News doubled the size
and gave the people of the county a paper at $1.00 a year.
Conditions have changed.
Seventeen year3 ago, blank paper cost 2 cents a pound; now, it
costs Gl; iak, then, coat 4 cents; now 14 cents. Type prices are out
of sight.
Is it surprising that the subscription price of the News should
advance? 1
All Bedford county papers went to $1.50 Ion? asro. The Mount
Union Times changed from a dollar, to a dollar and a half last July.
All over the country the price of newspapers is being advanced, for
just the same reason that flour, neat, eggs and butter cost almost
double the price of a few years aj.;o.
The publisher of the News hid the nerve seventeen years ago
to reduce the price from $1.50 to $1.00; he now has the nerve to
change it from a dollar to $1.50, and when conditions change suffi
ciently to warrant it, he will put the price back to a dollar.
Of course, subscriptions will be received up to the 21st of De
cember at the old price $1.00.
Husking C;e.
Owing to a scarcity of farm
help and a desire to raise funds
for the church, the Indies' Aid
of Wells Valley Pine Grove M. E.
church on Wednesday of last
week headed by the President
and Vice President hied their
way to W. L. Mosebey's' corn
field where they spent the day
husking corn. As to their ability
to do the work we believe Mr.
Mosebey would testify in their
behalf. The Ladies made the
corn fly; but it was not all work
and no play for a jolly good time
had they; and, as to the dinner
that was served, it was no small
part of the day's program, and
those having it in charge would
certainly feel complimented at
the rapidity with which it disap
peared. Mrs. Fred Reichtly was
an Aid visitor on this occasion,
and she very ably assisted in
preparing the dinner. Those of
the Aid present were: Mrs. V.
D. Schenck, Mrs. J. N. Duvall,
Mrs. A. F. Baker, Miss M. Romig,
Mrs. James Chamberlain, Mrs.
N. S. Edwards, Mrs. Hayes Biv
ens, Mrs. S. W. Anderson, Mrs.
H. E. Spangler, Mrs. G. W. Sipe,
Mrs. Charles Stunkard, Mrs. Har
vey Bivens, Mrs. W. L. Moseby
and Mary Moseby.
About Sheep.
Write a postal to M. S. Mc
Dowell, State College, Pa., and
a3k for the latest little book on
Sheep Raising it is free for the
asking. This book of G2 pages
contains a world of information
wanted right now by many farm
ers who are thinking of increas
ing their profits by the introduc
tion of sheep. There are reasons
for failure, as well as for sucess,
in all undertaking?, and our ex
perimental station at State Col
lege, Pa., has worked out both
sides about sheep raising.
It seems that there is some
confusion about the name of the
post office at State College.
"State College" is the name of
the post cilice, as well as the
name of, the school. Mr. M. S.
McDowell is a director of Agricul
tural Extension at that place.
Inforuulion Wsufcd.
A Pittsburgh ' man is making
inquiry about an expedition to
Missouri between the years 1805
and 1810 by some young men
from that part of Bedford county
now a part of Fulton county.
He wants to know if the men
were ever heard from, as it is
believed all werekilled by Indians.
He also asks the location of Scotch
Valley. Can our readers answer
one or both, of these questions.
Mrs. Isadiah Hart, a native of
this county, but for many years
a resident of Hartford City, Ind.,
writes that she is reasonably well
for one of her age, that she has
broken up housekeeping and is
now making her home with her
children,

Fulton County's Eggs.
According to figures just com
piled by the State Department of
Agriculture, Fulton county pro
duce3 annually approximately
555,360 dozens of eggs. Estimat
ing the average price at twenty'
five cents makes the value of the
eggs produced annually in this
county reach the sum of $138,-
840.00.
A3 nearly as estimate can be
made, seventy eggs per year is
the average for each hen in the
United States. The totals for
Fulton county would indicate that
the average farm flock for Fulton
county numbers about sixty-five
hens, and we believe that is not
far from correct. Some think
twenty-five cents is a little too
high for the average price. But
even at twenty cents, the total
amount received for eggs during
the year would be over $100,000
a magnificent sum of money from
the Busy Biddies of this county.
Observe the Law.
The News desires to point out
some good that may come from
the movement for the preserva
tion of game by the punishment
of illegal hunting. The very
first requisite of good citizenship
is obedience to law. A man may
be a "good" father, husband,
farmer, Democrat or Rebublican,
but if he is not a law-abiding
man he is a bad citizen. Let
fathers and mothers teach re
spect for law and they will in
that way do much to make good
men and women. A community
of farmers who will stick togeth
er can accomplish almost any
desired end, and if petty law
breaking is a local offense,
there cannot be a more desirable
object than the breaking up of
the practice by a few doses of
the law, if necessary. We fully
believe that many a young man
has been saved from grave
crimes by being suddenly
brought face to face with the
consequences of illegal acts,
though committed on a small
scale.
liieM Kejser.
Mr. Irwin Diehl, son of Daniel
S. Diehl, of Franklin county, and
Mis3 Minnie Belle Keyser, of
Franklin county, were united in
marriage on November 2, 1916,
at tho home of Jacob S. Hill, in
Belfast township, by Rev. J. C.
Garland. The bride's parents
were former Fulton county cit
izens. Roy Elvey, on the George
Brant farm on west side of the
Ridge, .was in town Tuesday
making arrangements to adver
tise his sale on November 24th.
Some time in December, he will
remove to Pulaski, in the west
ern part of the State, where he
has an option on several jobs at
; dairy farming, or working on the
railroad.
OCTOBER BONOS ROLL
Names of New Subscribers and Others
Who Paid Subscription During
The Month of October. -
The "Honor Roll" for October
appears a week late this month
on account of the press for adver
tising space last week. It, how
ever, contains the names of those
only who paid in October, and the
payers in this month will appear
in the first issue in December.
Owing to the fact that the price
of the News is going from a dol
lar to a dollar and a half a year,
it will ve;y much facilitate the
keeping of subscription accounts,
if everyone in arrears would pay
up, and pay a year or more in
advance. By doing this a half
dollar a year would be saved. As
will be noticed elsewhere in this
paper, the subscription price of
The Fulton County News after
the 20th of December will be one
dollar and fifty cents a year. Of
course, all who are paid ahead of
that date will not come under the
$1.50 date until their term of
subscription expires.

THE DANGERS OF GLUTTONY.
Little Talks on Health and Hjgiene by
Samuel G. Dixon, H. D., LL. D.,
Commissioner of Health.
The children of the Iriquois In
dians it is said, were trained to
eat frugally and taught that over
eating was far worse than under
eating. They were warned that
gluttons would be caught by a
monster known as Sagodakwus,
who would humiliate them in a
most terrible manner if he found
that they were gourmands.
With the price of food stuffs
soaring to almost unheard of fig
ures, in thousands of house
holds the question of where and
how to save on the food supply
is an important one. Most peo
ple eat more than they need.
This is particularly true of that
class of individuals engaged in
sedentary occupations.
Perhaps you do not feel that
you come under this head, but
suppose you try a few experi
ments. Make some slight inves
tigation of the nutritive values of
the different foods, cut your ex
cessive allowances, eat slowly,
and drink plenty of water but
not at meal times.
It is said that the Indians had
but two regular meals a day.
The Iriquois had but one. Cer
tain it is that an increasing per
centage of our population suc
cumb to degenerative diseases
and the concensus of medical
opinion is that overeating is an
important causative factor.
State Agricultural Notes.
Preliminary estimates on the
Pennsylvania apple crop by the
State Department of Agriculture
place the production at 6,610,500
barrels.
The peach crop of 1,124,200
bushels sold on an average of
eighty-nine cents a basket or a
total estimated value of $1,998.76,
Last year's crop which was almost
twice as large had a value of only
$1,839,600.
From present indications Penn
sylvania will rank second for ap
ple production in the United
States. New York holds first
place.
Farmers who failed to spray
their potatoes had poor crops in
most sections this season.
Pasture is below the average,
due to the drought in many parts
of the State.
Potatoes rotted in the ground
this season to a greater extent
than in former years, and in some
places were nearly a failure.
Bedford county farmers report
the corn crop the best in ten
years.
York county has its bumper
corn crop and many fields will
show over 100 bushels of shelled
corn to an acre.
Blair county farmers have fig
ured that it was exactly ninety
days between the spring and au
tjmn frosts.
Cameron county reports a kill
ing frost on September 17th,
while the first general frost
throughout the State was two
days later.
