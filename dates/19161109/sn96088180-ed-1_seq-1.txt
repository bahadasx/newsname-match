bearing of the election In the United

ascribed," said Vorwaerts. "first, to
a united party, and second, tilths

only American presidents In that
time to threaten America with a Eu
ropean war, Only England's back

phon voters."

bulletins regarding the election had
followed Renter's first announcement

In doubt Is not true, because Wash
ington already has officially notified
Secretary Grey, of the Amerlcnn em
bassy, that Hughes Is elected."

TWO STATES MAY
SWING ELECTION
New York, Nov. 9. Th tide for
Wilson set In so strong In California
and Minnesota this afternoon that It
appeared probable at 3:45 this after
noon returns from these two states
would Indicate the president's elec
tion. Two Philadelphia newspapers
which hare strongly supported
Hughes In the campaign, conceded
their candidate's defeat. They were
the Evening Ledger and the North
American. ,
The belief that the Wilson drift
would result In his choice was based
on these developments:
Hughes must carry both Minne
sota and California to win.
Wilson's lead In California Is
steadily maintained.
Hughes' lead In Minnesota Is being
cut down as further returns come In.
The precise drift In these states
and the other smaller doubtful states
ot New Hampshire and New Mexico,
showed, on the United Press returns
available at 3:46:
California 5,692 out or 5,867 pre
cincts: Wilson leading by 6,055
votes; to, come, 175 precincts.
New Hampshire 248 out of 294
precincts: Hughes, leading by . 279;
