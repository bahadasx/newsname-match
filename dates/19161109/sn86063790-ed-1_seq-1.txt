Versions of Ehrhardt Tragedy as
in Hf-hat* Pq i\^rc

" - The following account of the kill-,
ing of Mr. C. E. Kinsey at Ehrhardtj
by Mr. G. J. Hiers appeared in last'
week's Bamberg County Times. This!
account differs from that told by witnesses
at the inquest. As The Herald
wishes to print all the facts obtainable,
we herewith reprint the Bamberg
County Times version, also accounts
from other papers.
G. J. Hiers Killed C. E. Kinsey.
An unfortunate tragedy occurred
at Ehrhardt on Friday afternoon of
last week. From the best information
that can be obtained. Mr. C. E.
Kinsey had been violating the prohibition
laws, and warrants had been
sworn out against him. He regard-1
ed Haskell and George Hiers as his
principal prosecutors in these matters,
and it was said that Kinsey's
mind turned to revenge. The officers
of the law recently disarmed
Kinsey and took his pistol away;
that recently he had gotten a new
five-shooter, six-inch barrel, ana
showed it to his friends and told
them what he intended to do with
this pistol. That he had gotten it
expressly to use upon the Hiers people.
On Friday he bought a new
double-barrelled shot gun, and told
his friends on the streets of Ehrhardt
that he wanted a gun that would
shoot buck shot; that he was tired of
hunting small game," and that he was
now after men. Also said that he ex.
pected that either he, or George
Hiers or Haskell Hiers, or all of
them, would die with their shoes on,
and said that he expected to kill six
men in the town of Ehrhardt, and !
then blow his own brains out.
j
Late Friday afternoon, Mr. Geo. J.
Hiers, being near Ehrhardt, drove into
the town; and afterwards in pass
ing the store where Kinsey was
standjng, he was spoken to by Kin-i
sev, and words passed between fhem
and an altercation arose, and Kinsey
began drawing his pistol out of bis
pocket, the hammer hung, and Hiers
tried to stop Kinsey, but failing fired.
The shots took effect in the shoulder'
and neck and in Kinsev's struggle to,
get his pistol which had hung in the
pocket, he was shot tljree times. The |
pistol was taken later from the body
by Magistrate Kinard, and is still in
his possession.
This is an exceedingly unfortunate
tragedy as it is now believed that
Kinsey's mind by reason of liquor

such a state as made him almost irresponsible
and deadly dangerous.
It is doubly sad for it forced a good
man to take his life.
There are several who saw the killing
but only one or two know the
details.?Bamberg County Times.
Fatal Shooting.
Charles Kinsev was shot to pieces
and killed last week and we are told
George Hiers is charged with the killing.
We hear he surrendered to the
sheriff. It is said there had been a
feud between Kinsey and George
Hiers and his son, Haskell. Sometime
ago Haskell and Kinsey had a
difficulty and Kinsey struck Haskell

Carlisle Loses to Freshmen.
Although the Carolina freshmen
won from Carlisle school of Bamberg,
Friday afternoon, 19 to 6, they
haf to play about the best football of
the season to turn the trick. The
preps put up a terrific battle and the
first half ended with the count in a
knot, 6 to 6. The score at the end
of the third quarter was the same
and the collegians could not tuck the
pastime away until the last quarter
when they made two touchdowns,
both coming from long forward
passes.
The Bamberg contingent launched
a distinct surprise. Foster's followers
expected to win handily but they
reckoned without Lenoir, Hough,
Luther, Sistrunk and others. Lenoir,
the captain of the visitors, played a
wonderful game. He made Carlisle's
lone touchdown by running a punt
back 35 yards to the goal line and
time after time he cut loose for dazzling
runs. He did not depend on
skirting the ends but threw his diminutive
body through the line for
substantial gains. He also threw a
dozen or so perfect forward passes.
He had plenty of nerve and negotiated
forward passes when almost in
the shadow of his goal posts. Hs
was guilty of only one error during
the afternoon. He tried a long forward
pass on the third down, witi
only about six yards to go for a
touchdown and two downs to make
it in. The pass went over the goa
line and the ball went to Carolina or
the 20-yard line.
I , Hough played a sensational game
! for Carlisle. The big fullback buck
! ed the line in impressive style. He
made several first downs in one dive
and divided first downs into twc
1 plays more than once. The othei
backs, Luther and Sistrunk, alse
played well. Luther is a Columbit
1 boy and got a good hand from the
; home folk at the game. The line-up:
