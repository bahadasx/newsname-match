Road Working A
Success.
The road working at Summer
field last Saturday was a success
in very way. The good ladies
were present with the dinner and
the men were there with their
I teams and implements. A pretty
1 good road was built but still it
wouldn't hurt to have another
working soon while the weather
is gOOd. ; '" .' :-; ' ' ' '

NOVEMBER
' (By Leila Mae Wilson)
"November comes like some gray ghost
Across the hills and valleys;
In russet leaves beneath her feet
The, wind makes sudden sallies.
. The bare trees stand like sentinels
r- All silent, gray and dripping,
; Beneath the slaty, low-hung cloud9
Where vapor-wraiths are slipping.
The golden-rod has lost its glow, ,;.
The cricket in the hedges
Croons soft and low, whife spiders spin
A gauz across the sedges.
The bramble'leaves are flaming red ;
Along the sullen rivers,
And with the, lowland's tangled growth
The em'rald smilax quivers. V
; The little streams are half asleep,
With waters softly muffled
, By fallen leaves, their russet banks
f No longer daisy-ruffle 1.
Oh, haste, November, gaunt and grim,
Another step isnearing!
For Christmas waits impatiently
, Withmesage sweet and cheering.

Safety v First At
Road Crossings.
N. O. & St. L. Makes , Special
Appeal To Motorists To ' ,
' Be More Careful. ? '
Hardly a day passes but the
public prints chronicle the death
or serious injury to persons in
automobiles at some railroad
crossing. These accidents are us
ually followed bv litigation in
actions for damages, when a
little application of good old
horse sense on the part of the
drivers of cars might have pre
vented the accident. There
seems to be too great a disposi
tion on the part autoists, to "take
a chance." ; ' v v
In order to lessen such acci
dents and, if possible, reduce
them to a minimum on the N. O.
& St. L., an appeal, to all drivers
and owners of cars is being sent
out by the safety department
through Superintendent O. - M.
Anderson, . -These warnings are
to be posted n every garage a,nd
automobile rapair shop in the
territory of the road so that the
careless driver , may see it at
every turn. It is a plea for co
operation. It urges the motorist
to "play safe." It is too late
when the motor stops, or when'
his engine chokes t ;
The railroads are seeking to
avoid these accidents, and .the
drivers of automobiles or other
vehicles ought to be much inter
ested in avoiding such accidents
as the . railroads are. A little
more co-operation will accom
plish the desired result. The
garages and repair shops have
manifested a desire to assist and
it is believed that the campaign
for "safety first at road crossings"
will have a splendid effect in re
ducing the number of avoidable
accidents. .
The proposed campaign on the
N. 0. & St, L. is in line witn the
other safety movements over
the country, and the co-operation
and support of the public is
earnestly desired, not only by
the drivers and owners of auto
mobiles and other vehicles which
use the crosfings, but by pedes
trians S'- H
The application of safety-first
principles, will got a long' way in
reducing accidents' and the con
sequent litigation and the man
agement of the! road believes that
this appeal will find a hearty re
sponse in the minds of all fair
minded citizens
