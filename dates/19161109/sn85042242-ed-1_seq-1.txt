Member of Upper House from
20th Retired— Other Returns
to Date
The political complexion of the Fif­
teenth legislative assembly remains
somewhat in doubt. On tbe face of
early returns there would seem to be
some question as to the Non-Partisan
league's having undisputed sway in
the senate. While it has lost house
members in several important dis­
tricts. the league will prevail without
question in that branch. Such war
liorses as Senator M. L. McBride of
Dickinson, from the 31st,, and Senator
Hans P. Jacobson of Mott, from the
49th, have been returned with big ma­
jorities over their Non-Part isan op­
ponents. The 31
st returns two veter­
an members of the house—H. J. Blan
chard, of Dickinson, and Claude C.
Turner, of Gladstone—and H. A. Mac
ItofT of Relfleld is elected on the same
ticket to 9UQceed Frank X. Wanner of
Dickinson, who lost out in the primar­
ies. The 49tli, composed of Adams,
Hettinger and Sioux, will send down
to keep Senator. Jacobson company
Representatives B. J. Stinger of Pet­
rel, who was a member of the Four­
teenth assembly, and Henry Moen of
Hettinger, Republicans, with J. M.
Carignan, Democmt:

Bond it Bumped..
On the other hand, Senator Walter
R. Bond of Minot went down in defeat
before Thorwald Mostad, the Non­
partisan league nominee running on
the Democratic ticket, and the pros­
pects are that a straight Non-Partisan
delegation will be sent to the house
from Ward county. Nineteen precincts
in Pierce county indicate the election
of two Non-Partisan representatives to
the house.
Majorities Large.
Stark county stood loyally by the
Republican legislative ticket, giving
McBride, in 28 out of 34 precincts.
1.325 to 752 for S. D. Gregg, of Glad­
stone, his opponent on the Independ­
ent ticket. Blanchard, in the 31st,
polled 1,266, Mackoff 1,115, and Claude
C. Turner, 1.352, to 703 for Charles
Davis of Belfield: 797 for W. J. Mose
ley of Dickinson, and 49 for Nick Rei
mer of Lefor, independent candidates.
Big Lead for Hans.
In the 49th, Sioux complete gave
Jacobson 308 to 34 for bis independent
opponent, O. II. Opland of Mott. Carig­
nan led in the voting on the Sioux
county legislative ticket, with 346
Moen received 291 Stinger 278. Byron
B. Bobb of Haines. Robert B. Goud

the house, received 30, 30 and 27, re­
spectively.
N. P. Ticket Wins Here.
The Non-Partisan legislative candi­
dates had a walk-away in Burleigh.
Fifty-three out of 54 precincts in this
county gave Carol D. King of Menoken,
Republican candidate for the senate,
1.773. and Rev. Bruce E. Jackson of
Bismarck, his Democratic opponent,
522. The Republican candidates for
the house—Frank G. Prater of Arena.
L. D. Bailey of Moffit and Gebrge N.

HE YET I'm
Both State Chairmen Warned to
be on Lookout for Crooked
Work
1
Although both state chairmen at the
Fargo headquarters have been warned
to be on the look-out for fraud, and
Chairman Lemke of the Depublican
state central committee has received
authority from the national headquar­
ters to engage counsel, if necessary,
no circumstance has yet arisen which
would justify any suspicion of crook­
ed work in connection with North Da­
kota's election. Both Lemke and Mc­
Lean. when interviewed by the Tri­
bune last evening, stated that no ir­
regularities had been reported, and
that none was anticipated.
The east seems to be much exercis­
ed over the possibility that someone
may attempt to put something across.
The New York World, an original Wil­
son paper, last evening wired:
"Watch carefully for any evidence
of fraud and holding back of returns
to change results. Ask Democratic
headquarters if they know anything."

Death of Elector Causes Peculiar
Situation in Western
State
Tacoma, Wash., Nov. S.—There ap­
pears to be a possibility that, al­
though President Wilson carried
Washington, Hughes may get one of
the seven electoral votes of Washing­
ton. The death of A. Stream, a Dem­
ocratic elector, shortly before elec­
tion. and the substitution of E. M.
Connor as elector came so late that
in many counties the name of Stream
i-ather than Connor appeared on the
ballot. It is said that thousands of
voters voted for Stream and these
votes will be invalid and the differ­
ence may be sufficient, according to
local Republicans, to give Hughes an
elector.

HOUSE IN DOUBT.
New York, Nov. 9.—Although
the Democrats are assured control
of the senate by a working major­
ity, control of the. house was still
in doubt at an early hour today.
The Democrats had made slight
gains in the late returns from
Montana and Kansas.
At 1 o'clock, 205 Democrats, 201
Republicans, two Progressives,
one Socialist and one independent
had been elected, with 25 congres­
sional districts yet to be heard
from.
New York: Nov. °.—With thirty con
gressional districts to be heard from
at 10:45 p. m., 202 Republicans, 199
Democrats, two Progressives, ojye In­
dependent and one Socialjib have been
elected to the house of representatives
for the 65th congress. Of the thirty
districts yet to be heard from, 17 are
represented in the present congress by
Democrats and 13 by Republicans.
Should these districts he unchanged
the next house would be composed of
216 Democrats, 215 Republicans and
four scattering, who might elect to
affiliate with either side.
The senate will remain under Dem­
ocratic control by a reduced majority
of ten or twelve, dependent on the out­
come in New Mexico, where A. A.
Jones, Democrat, is maintaining a
slight lead over Prank A. Hubbell,
nominated by t,lie Republicans to suc­
ceed Senator Catron. At this hour,
the senate stands: Democrats, 63

Long Branch, N. .1., Nov, 8.—Confi­

President Wilson watched returns

North Dakota is in the Wilson col­

With returns in from 1,817 pre­
cincts out of 1,859. Wilson has 50,819
to Hughes' 49,972. The returns still
to be received comprise those from
Slope county,'which has a small vote,
not enough to overcome the lead.
Wilson's net lead at an early hour,
based on official returns from county
auditors, was 847.
The contest by counties will be
found in tabular form upon another

Outside of the presidency, the state

exception of Steen has been elected.

San Francisco. Nov. S.—Chester H.

night Hughes' election in California by
a small majority. Mr. Rowell's state­
ment follows:
Figures gathered by tbe Los Angeles
office of the Republican state commit­
tee, covering more than 1.000 precincts
and close estimates of the remaining
precincts now indicate that Hughes
will carry Los Angeles county by 23,
000..
"The Los Angeles office estimates
that this lead will be increased 12,000
more by other Southern California
counties. If these figures are borne
out by the final count. Hughes will

REPUBLICAN LEADERS
CLAIM THE STATE
HUGHES IN LEAD.
St. Paul, Minn., Nov. 8.—
Charles E. Hughes took the lead
in the presidential contest in
Minnesota, when returns from
2,481 precincts out of 3,024 in the
state, compiled at midnight, gave
Wilson 160,141 and Hughes 160,
365.
St. Paul, Minn., Nov. 8.—Minnesota
tonight was still among the few
doubtful states on which rested the
decision between Wilson and Hughes.
The big margin by which the presi­
dent led the most populous counties,
Ramsey, Hennepin and St. Louis, ear­
ly this morning had dwindled down
by nightfall. Leaders of both parties
claimed the state this evening, the
Wilson backers believing the 18,575
plurality in the counties named would
withstand the hard onslaught of the
country ballots, while the remarkable
gains made by Hughes as returns
from the outlying precincts came in
caused the Republicans to predict his
ultimate victory.
Drops to 955.
Wilson's lead in Minnesota dropped
to 955 shortly after :»:i)0 p. m., when
2,297 precincts out of the 3,024 in the
state save Wilson 151,569 j)nd Hughes
150,614.
Returns came in with a tardiness
that exasperated the leaders. Every
effort apparently was made here to
procure early and accurate count and
quick reports by the county officials,
but the truly rural districts were
slow. Nearly every county in the
state had been heard from by 7
o'clock tonight, but many reports
were far from complete.
Republicans affected to take heart
from what they term the Hughes
trend in the more thickly settled of
the counties outside the big three.
They said the counties Wilson ad­
herents would rely on were sparsely
settled, with a voting strength prac­
tically negligible.
See Victory.
Hughes' gain was one of the most
remarkable in history, according to
veterans of the political arena, and
if in maintains tonight the rate at
which it was made today, it is assur­
ed that he will win the state. His
gains for tbe last 92 precincts aver­
aged 18—the very latest ran it up
practically to 20. At 7 o'clock he was
in round numbers 4,000 votes behind
Wilson, with about 1,000 precincts to
hear from. An average of four votes
to the precinct would win him a tie
with Wilson, and his average gain of
18, Republicans say, will be maintain

It began to dwindle as the rural vote

California's vote is being tabulated
