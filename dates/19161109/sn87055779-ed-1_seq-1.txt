FAHGO. N. r.. Nov. 9. North
Dakota apparently has gone demo
cratic. Party leaders at 12 o'clock
declared there no longer was any
doubt that the state has gone demo
cratic, and the figures appear to
back up their claims.
With only 162 precincts missing at
that time, Pres't Wilson had a lead
of 1,543 over Hughes. The 162
precincts that are missing are lo
cated in the extreme northwest part
of the state where the democrats
are claiming the voters favor Wil
son 2 to 1.
The figures from 1.697 preclncta
out of 1.SÖ9 at 12 o'clock showed
Wilson 52,894; Hughes, 51,351.
It is doubtful if additional figures
will change the returns materially.
They are expected to increase the
I rc5ident's lead.
The missing 162 precincts lie in
thinly populated districts and re
turns may be long delayed in com
ing in.

DEFEAT OF LIPPITT IS
THE BIGGEST SURPRISE
Women Voters of Utah Take
Things in Own Hands and
Keep Sen. Sutherland
From Winning Out.
International News Service:
NI-:V YORK, Nov. 9. The Fnited
States senate is safely democratic.
The revised indications today were
that it will be made up as follows:
IemoTJit.s ."!.
Ilepiiblicans 12.
These figures are based upon the
.i rent success of Seil. Gilbert M.
Hitchock in Nebraska, where at f.ist
he seemed to have been defeated;
A. A. Jones, former assistant secre
tary of the interior, in New Mexico;
J. D. Kendrick, democrat, in Wyom
ing and Sen. Atlee Pomerene in
Ohio. Up until early today the re
turns available indicated that all
four had been defeated by repub
licans. The biggest surprises of the sen
atorial contest was the defeat of
Sen. Uppitt or re-election by Peter
G. Gerry, democrat, which was due
to the latter receiving the united
support of the labor leaders and of
Sen. George Sutherland, republican,
in Utah, where the women voters
took things into their own hands.
The election of William M. Talder.
republican, in New York, served to
slmw his great popularity in that
state, as he led the national and
state tickets by thousands of votes,
in snowing under completely William
F. McCombs, original Wilson man
and former c hairman of the demo
cratic national committee.
Contest is Planned.
Although on the face of the re
turns Sen. Chilton has been substan
tially defeated by his republican
opponent, Hep. Kutherland, in West
Virginia, the democrats will not con
cede this and are preparing to carry
the contest into the courts and be
fore the senate itself.
It had been freely predicted that
organized labor would defeat James
F. Watson, republican, in Indiana,
but the returns available here indi
cate that he ran well up with his
teammate, Harry' q. New. and that
both senators from the Hoosier state
are republicans.
The defeat of Sen. DuPont in
Delaware was due to family troubles.
Members of his f .riily who are on
the outs with him over business mat
ters financed the fight against him.
The result was the election of a
democrat, J. O. Wolcott, despite the
fact that Gov. Hughes carried the
state.
Pres't Wilson carried Maryland,
but he was unable to carry- through
with him David J. Lewis, the demo
cratic senatorial candidate who was
defeated, his friends assert, because
he was an open advocate of govern
ment ownership.

International News Service:
NEW. YORK, Nov. 9. Any one
meeting diaries Fvans Hughes in
the lobby of the Hotel Astor this
morning would not have suspected
that a hair's breadth separated him
from the highest office in the great
est country in the world. If the
former judg? had been passing upon
a supreme court case his judicial
calm could not have been any more
pronounced. The candidate smiled
and chatted with friends and appar
ently was giving no thought to the
uncertainties of politics.
The only sign of anxiety Mr.
Hughes gave was his eager reading
of the election news in the morning
papers.
Mr. Hughes went to bed about
midnight, after conferring with
Chairman Willcox, and was up be
fore 9 o'clock. He had no special
plans for the day aside from confer
ences with some of his political
managers and a motor ride.
