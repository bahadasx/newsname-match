Teams and Leaders Report Last Night
—Work Continues Today, In City
and Outside
The mammoth thermometer on the
north side of the Union block stands
today at near $10,000.00. The giant
instrument is not only a thermometer
but also a barometer and the present
reading after the first day of the
whirlwind campaign for a hospital,
indicates weather conditions favorable
for fund raising.
Work at the great task of raising
$40,000 to build a hospital suited to
the needs of the Williston territory
began yesterday morning. Sixteen
teams of workers, each headed by a
captain, began the canvass of the city.
In accordance with prearranged
plans, the directors of the campaign,
the executive council and the captains
net at Library hall at six o'clock last
evening where supper was served and
reports of the day's work rendered.
The grand total of (collections and
pledges was $9,340.00.
Reverend James H. Batten and Wm.
G. Owens made five minute talks. The
banners for the largest amount rais
ed during the day by a woman's team,
and for the largest number of sub
scribers secured by a woman's team
were awarded to Mrs. G. B. Everson
as captain. The banners for the larg
est sum and the largest number of
subscribers obtained by a man's team
were awarded to Rev. H. S. Harriss,
whose team secured nearly' $3,000
from twenty-seven people. The ex
ecutive council, whose assigned task
was to secure a good sized sum dur
ing the first day as a nest egg, report
ed $2,100.
The excellent results of the day's
work gave renewed confidence to ev
eryone connected with the campaign.
All feel certain of the largest degree
of* success that has been noped for.
Beginning today the territory adjacent
to Williston will be systematically
covered and no doubt is felt that a
generous response .to this worthy
cause will be made by the people vis
ited.
Watch the mercury, in the big ther
mometer approach the $40,000 mark
as the campaign grows warmer.

in his discussion of public questions.
He gave considerable^ attention to the
rural credits law which he voted for
and in which he is deeply interested.
He stated repeatedly and emphatical
ly that he considered the new act one
of the best measures for the farm
ers of the northwest that has been
Re

greatly regretted that some of the
the republican speakers and campaign
managers were criticizing the law. He
explained to his audiences the basic
features of the law and why he be

northwest.
STOCK SIKH* SPECIAL
fOR CHICAGO DEC. 4
NORTH DAKOTA FARMERS WILL
TRAVEL ON FINE TRAIN—
FRAZIER WILL GO
F. R. Crane, agricultural extension
agent for the Great Northern was in
Williston today to perfect plans for
the Official North Dakota Live Stock
Special to the International Live Stock
Show at Chicago. Mr. Crane finds
much interest in the train* which will
he first class in all respects. The rouftd
trip fare includes all accommodations.
Governor-elect Frasier and John N.
Hagen the successful candidate for
commissioner of agriculture and lab
bor have agreed to accompany the
train.-
Before his visit to Williston Mr.
Crane had written the following let
ter to Secretary Morrill which con
tains full information concerning the
train. The letter?
Secy. Morrill is in receipt of the
following letter from F. ft. Crane,
agricultural agent of the Great Nor
thern, relative to the stockmen's spe
cial train to the International Live
Stock show at Chicago. Mr. Crane
says:
"The present plan seems to be that
we will have between two and three
hundred people to make the round
trip to Chicago. This train leaves
North Dakota on Monday, December
4th. If there are enough people go
ing from Williston to fill a car, we
will be glad to place a sleeper there
and have it pulled down to Minot on
the regular train where we will then
make up our special. You understand
we cannot run a special unless we
have enough people for three cars and
for that reason we will give the Wil
liston people the benefit of a sleeper,
but it will be run in our regular train
into Minot and from there with the
special.
"We will spend Tuesday, Dec. 5th
in St. Paul Wednesday in Madi
son, Wis., Thursday, Friday and Sat
urday at the International Show in
Chicago, returning to North Dakota
the following Monday.
"The total cost from Williston, in
cluding sleeper, railroad fare, meals
and all entertainment in connection
with the trip, will be $72.00 from
Ray $70.70, White Earth $69.60, Stan
ley people to pay regular fare from
Williston to Minot and from there
purchase round trip ticket from our
St. Paul representative who will be
with the train.
"I shall personally conduct this
tour and with my assistants handle
the train until it returns. Every day
has some educational agricultural fea
tures marked out.
"I wish you would feel like adver
tising this proposition quite thorough
ly and secure from the western part
of North Dakota as large a repre
sentation as possible. Here is a
chance for some publicity that will
really mean something to your com
munity.
"We expect to have large exhibits
of agricultural products. This will
be under the direction of Mr. Flint,
the North Dakota Immigration agent.
Exhibits from Williston, brot along
by your people would be very wel
come.
"We will be entertained at St. Paul
by the Association of Commerce and
the Chicago people expect to do the
same.
"I would be glad to hear from you
fully as to how your people feej about
this trip."
Very trulv yours,
F. R. Crane.

(Th^sday) six precincts were still

Excepting the vote on sheriff and
one or two county commissioners, the

cated that the race was practically
a tie, Judge Fisk being six votes in
the lead with five precincts to hear

Strom Is Sheriff
The race for sheriff in this county
was by far the closest contest and was
followed with intense interest. L. V.
Coulter who won the Republican nom
ination by a single vote led in the
early returns but was passed by his
opponent, Axel Strom, when about
half the precincts had reported. This
morning with only five precincts miss
ing Strom led Coulter by 186 and his,
friends were confident that the. re
maining returns would put his
plurality above 200. Strom ran on!
the Socialist ticket and this is the'
third successive time that the candi
date on that ticket has been elected
to the office. Mr. Strom has been
deputy during the two terms of Carl
Erickson. He ran well in Williston
although Coulter had a good lead. In
Ray, Strom's home town, he received
a 2 to 1 vote.

Dozen States Doubtful
New York, Nov. 8.—With a decided
drift toward the re-election of Presi
dent Wilson the result of the election
is still officially in doubt today.
Upon a dozen doubtful states from
which returns are coming slowly de
pends whether Wilson has been re
elected or Hughes will be the next
president of the United States.
The chairmen of. both national com
mittees claimed a majority in the
electoral college, but the actual fig
ures made good the claims of neither.
Wilson is reasonably certain of 232
votes in the electoral college, and the
*same returns pointed to 218 for
Hughes, with 81 votes doubtful and
266 being needed for an election, the
states in doubt are being watched
closely.
These states with 81 votes include

New York, Nov. 8.—With the coun

Republican headquarters were scenes
of nervous activity and tension.
Both sides were claiming majorities
in the electoral college, but there
seemed, nevertheless, to be a feeling
in both places that there was a chance
that the determination of the final re

that the decision might eventually be

The statement, he said, was based on advices from the respec
