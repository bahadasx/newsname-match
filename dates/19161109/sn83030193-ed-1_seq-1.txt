Tho Trench liner Kspagne, Cnpt.

patched up amidships, ennvns nnd
pinnies hiding jan ugly hole torn Into
her by nn unknown tramp steamer In
the It iy of lllscny on tho night of
Oct. 31, her third day out from Hor

tho American steamer J. H. King to
the French Government for Its for

on deck when tho crnsh came. Only
tho prompt work of Cnpt. Laurent
saved the F.spngne from being cut In
two nnd her 30r passengene nnd rrew
being sent to the bottom. It wasn't
tho fault of tho unknown steamer
that this did not hnppen.
"The granger loomed up out of the
black night without lights," said
Capt. ,le, "henrlng right down on
us amidships. It was 11.30 o'clock
nt night nnd a storm was raging with
a mussy sen. The lookout saw th"
steamer n quickly as I did and gave
the alarm. Capt. Laurent turned her
over hard a starlKiard and If the
captain of the other vessel had gone
to port she would have gone clear
of us. Hut he went to starboard. His
ship went up on the crest of a big
wnve and smashed Into us. The Ks
pagne was Just sheering off nnd wo
got a glancing blow Instead of the
full force of tho Impact, whlrh would
have sent us to the bottom."
Passengers wero knocked out of
their berths and In a moment tho ship
was In n panic. ' LlfeboatH were
manned and swung out on tho davits.
The passengers were unuware of what
had happened and believed they had
been attacked by a submarine. The
lpagne sent out S O S calls, while
men went below to ascertain the ex
tent of the damage
Tho passenger wero held in re
straint, fly tho belief In tho submarine
attack and that they had half un hour
In which to leavj the vessul. Many

(Ity I'nlteil I'ross.)
SAN FRANCISCO, Cal., Nov. 9. United Press tabu
lation of returns from 5,692 precincts out of 5,870 in
California gave Wilson 456,329, Hughes 451,274, a lead
for Wilson of 5,055. There are 172 precincts to be heard
from.
(Ily AHiioclutcd I'rrsH.)
SAN FRANCISCO, Cal., Nov. 9. In 5,617 precincts
out of 5,870 in California Hughes has 449,360 votes, Wil-
nso 452,416. Wilson's plurality, 3,056. This leaves but
nine Los Angeles precincts to hear from.
If the United Press figures follow out the situation as they
have done heretofore, there is no doubt that California will be
carried by Wilson. The Associated Press figures, while differing
from those of the United Press also indicate that California is
safely in the Democratic column.
The California returns are confusing. In the city and
county of Los Angeles, for instance, one of the most progressive
communities in the world of counting the ballots, is not yet com
pleted. Succeeding despatches from Los Angeles show surpris
ing remifications. All the ballot boxes in California containing
uncounted ballots are under guard.
MINNESOTA Presidential returns in the State are nine
tenths complete. Hughes maintains a slight lead, and 2,736
prcincts out of 3,024 give him 172,308, Wilson 171,497, a
Hughes majority of 811.
The State of Minnesota has 2,136 voting militiamen on the
border. The commissioners sent to take their votes are on the
way home and will reach St. Paul on Sunday. Most of these
militiamen are from the cities, and the cities of Minnesota all
gave Wilson substantial majorities. Recent political polls
have shown that the staff officers of the militia of the State are
evenly divided politically. The Minnesota militiamen at the bor
der may decide this election.
NEW HAMPSHIRE With two precincts missing, the count
in New Hampshire gives Wilson a lead of 121. This was based
on certified returns to the Sccrcteiry of State from 256 precincts
and press returns from thirty-six.
The vote was: Wilson, 43,842; Hughes, 43,721. Secre
tary of State Bean corrected his earlier statement in which he
said that the Stale was complete. The two towns unreported
cast a very small vote.
