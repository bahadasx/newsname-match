Pcspuliing of receiving final returns
tonight, President Wilson retired at
ll:iO o'clock. He left word, however,
that he was to be awakened if any
thing really definite was received.
Secretary Tumulty and other offi
cials planned to remain until midnight
at least. The president was uncer-!
tain whether or not lie had been
elected, although his campaign man
agers were claiming a majority in the
electoral college.
President Wilson watched leturns
from Minnesota. California. New
Mexico, Oregon and New Hampshire
closely tonight because of assurance.
from his campaign managers that the
final outcome depended, on those
i states. 1
STONEMAN'S STATEMENT
"Upon the returns as far as we have received them,
Campbell leads by 285. This majority may be overcome by
the returns from Mohave county and an increased major
ity in Yuma and Gila.
"Owing to the delays in receiving returns, I cannot
see my .way clear to record a claim or a concession. I
will say, however, that if Mr. Campbell is elected, it will be
by less than 500 votes. "

placed Illinois delegation in the lower
house of congress at twenty-one re

is a net gain of four for the republi

congressmen were re-elected. Among
those defeated was. Frank Buchanan,
democrat representati e from the sev
enth, a Chicago district, who lost to
Niels Juul, who had been active in
state politics for many years.
Late leturns also removed the

was opposed by Harry C. Ferrlman,
republican.
In the snate, four present demo

They are Senators Kern and Taggart,
of Indiana, Martine of Now Jersey,
and Chilton of West Virginia. Three
republican senators, Lippitt, of Rhode

Barrett 3913, Galbraith 3818, Bishop

Allen is probably elected county
treasurer. His showing in 55 precincts,
exclusive of his home town of Mesa,
gave him 4128, against Webb's 4161.
Wilkey is elected sheriff. Oscar Rob
erts, who ran well during the early
hours of the afternoon, began failing
as later returns showed Wilkey's
strength. Fifty-five precincts showed
Roberts 4189 and Wilkey 4604.
Loch and Bone Tie
In a total of 56 precincts, assembled
by the county committee, Loch and
Bone were tied for assessor with 4154
votes apiece. Chairman McCfintoek
considered this indicative of Loch's
election.
Campbell Vote Grows
After ten hours of harrowing experi
ences for Campbell followers, during
which time -his Maricopa county ma
jority seemed to be dwindling. Mesa
and Alma came in and pumped up his
lead, so that democratic experts were
inclined to concede his election. A to
tal on 67 out of 77 precincts, complete
but not official, gave CamDbell 7688
and Hufit 4445. There remained strong
ly republican precincts south of the
river and in Phoenix, such as Numbers
9 and 17, yet to be heard from, and
the' chances are they will boost the
Campbell lead In Maricopa to close to
3400, which is the figure claimed by
the state central committee.
Wilkey Probable Victor
Wilkey workers stated late last
night that in fifty-two precincts, their
man had secured H10 majarity. On
this basis they can lose every other
precinct and still put their man over.
The efforts of the Rescue club ap
parently failed in the judgeship race,
for Lyman is just about conceded the
election.
Among the democrats who were
prominently remembered by the voters
were Bowen and Bradshaw, who led
for the supervisorial jobs. Bowen is
150 behind Bradshaw, which will give
the latter the long, term, of four years.
Refd runs third and Dana fourth.
Allen Is expected to beat Webb, and
Loch to pass Bone, though these lat
ter are not decided. Vaughp is a
winner for county recorder.
fORTRER FACTS
ABOUT ARABIA
AHE AWAITED
Republican A. P. Leased Wire
WASHINGTON, Nov. 8. Full
Information regarding the tor
pedoing yesterday of the British
passenger lines Arabia is awaited at
the stata department with concern.
There has been no report indicating
that Americans were on board the
vessel, but the announcement of the
British admiralty that a ship carrying
hundreds of passengers, including wo
men and children had been destroyed
without warning, added seriousness to
the submarine questions now pend
ing. If It should develop that the Arabia
carried no Americans, the Vnited
States probably would take no official
notice of the, incident, although the
deepest interest would be elt because
of the possibility that it might mean
a change In Germany's methods cf
submarine, warfare.
A brief cablegram from Ambassador
Page at London, late today, an
nounced the sinking of the liner. It
made no mentjon of Americans on
board. In the absence of Secretary
Lansing, who will not return to Wash

Kibbey May be Beaten
With the election interest centering
In the astonisnlng race between Hunt
and Campbell, little attention was paid
to the Kibbey-Ashurst contest in this
state until late yesterday afternoon.
A total on 58 precincts in Maricopa
county gave Kibbey 5010 and Ashurst
4476. This was exceedingly disap
pointing to republican workers, who
practically conceded the elect ion ot
the tall gentleman from the north.
Ashurst's majority in the state is
said to be about 4000, although this
is disputed by some republican work
ers, who have not given up hope of
winning by a dozen or so votes.
Carl Hayden will probably lead the
democratic ticket this year. Sidney
Osborn is elected, but by a much
smaller majority than he secured four
years ago, when he and Hayden led
the ticket.
Republican managers practically ad
mitted last night that they had elected
no state officials out side of Campbell.
Supporters of Judge Baughn, however,
claimed his election by a small ma
jority on the basis of his surprsing
run against Judge Ross in this county.
