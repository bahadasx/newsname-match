Of Washington's Votes
New Tork. Nov. 9 Chairman McCor
mick said today he would Investigate
reports received at Democratic head- !
quarters that the Republicans ln Wash
ington state may get one of the Dem
ocratic electoral votes on the ground
j that votes cast for one of the Demo- '
cratic electors, who died, were Invalid.
According to the reports, the name of
K. M Connor, the Democratic elector '
who was substituted for .V Stream, the
aeaa elector, did not appear on the bal-
many counties and It was stated
that therefore the votes cast for Stream
might be invalid, the difference giving '
a pluralitv for one Republican elector
"We will investigate the matter." '
said Chairman McCormlck. "but even if .
we are forced to concede the vote, I am
not worried asout the loss of one elec
toral vote."

WILSON LEADING

EW'YORK. Nov. 9. Wil
son's plurality in California
slowly dwindles as the count
proceeds toward finality.
Hughes's lead in Minnesota sIowl
increases as the count proceeds.
From latest returns available it ap
pears that Hughes has gained in Cali
fornia on the average 12 otes (addi
tional lead) to the precinct as counted.
If he keeps up this average to the end
Hughes will win the state. Hughes
has a Wilson lead of 2522 to over
come in the remaining 339 precincts.
In Minnesota Hughes has a lead of
only a few hundred, but the tendency
all day has been to increase the Hughes
j ote and decrease the Wilson vote.
t though very slightly either way.
Ine only states now regarded as
doubtful are Minnesota, California,
and New Mexico.
Wilson appears to have 260 electoral
votes, and Hughes 243. Wilson thus
1 needs only 6 votes, Hughes 23,
Either Minnesota or California
if
gamed will elect Wilson.
Hughes needs both to win.
Tampering with election returns ia
North Dakota was charged today.
Both parties assert that a recount in
New Hampshire will be necessary.
New Mexico will be very dose, bnt
unless there are more changes to be made
in the "certan." list of either candidate,
New Mexico will not affect the resnlt
i
I "ther way.
The fi,hr .. -,,.
lie fight seems to have narrowed
down to California and Minnesota.
In California with 5531 precincts
counted and 339 remaining to count,
Wilson's lead is 2522.
In Minnesota with 2846 precincts
counted and 178 remaining to count,
Hughes's lead is 893.
Of nine states classed as donbtfnl on
Wednesday, fonr have been assigned t
Hughes and three to Wilson, while Now
Mexico, formerly classed as Democratic,
is now regarded as donbtfnl; thus leav
ing three doubtful states.
