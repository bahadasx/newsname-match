My Trip to Moberly.
On the morning of October 23rd,
1916, 1 boarded the train No. 10 at
Des Arc for St. Louis; transferred to
No. 6 at De Soto and arrived in St.
Louis about 8:00 o'clock. Was met
at the train by my friend, Mrs. E. W.
Graves, and we had breakfast to
gether, i
After meeting Mrs. May, onr State
Correspondent Secretary of the W. U.
T. U., I secured my ticket for Moberly
and bidding my friend good-by, I
took my place in the special coach
attached to train No. 3 over the
Wabash at 9:30 for Moberly, Mo. We
had a very delightful trip to say the
least. Everything was done by the
trainmen possible for our comfort,
for which we white ribboners were
very grateful.
We arrived In Moberly at 1:30 p. M.
and stepping off the train right into
the . arms of the white ribboners of
Moberly, who composed the reception
committee. We were at once taken
in autos to the Central Christian
Church, and assigned to our homes
during the convention.
Af.er a good rest we were taken to
the M. E. Church, South, for supper

plains and crowning with heavenly
whiteness the hills, I still am here-
still working to increase the next
harvest. All winter long I labor, eat

How many bugs and beetles and
weed seed do I eat? Well, I wonder!
I cannot say, but here is what science

lungs. She had taken on a little, of
bis enthusiasm for she, too, was going
there not to slay, but to enjoy what
6he could of whatever there was.
The week of vacation passed quickly.
The youth seemed gaining strength
and hunted all the beautiful places;
talked of nothing but the time when
he could go to. work. No one cared
to take the time to " listen to his
rhapsodies only this one friend who
was never too tired to listen for she

A Little Story of Real Life. x
"ON THE MOUNTAIN TOP."
Seated in a dusty ill-kept seat of
one of the daily morning trains leav
ing a western city sat a tired, worn
out woman near middle age. She had
seated herself i with great care ar
ranging her wraps and bag so as to
share the seat with any delated pas
senger. She wa9 dressed neatly, and.
although of cheap material, her
clothes fitted perfectly. Her face and
form had been one of rare beauty.
The silvery hair loosely drawn back
seemed carresHing the spiritual face
beneath. Time and care had not
robbed her of all. Leaning wearily
back in the dingy Beat she closed her
eyes seemingly oblivious to her sur
roundings, too tired, too exhausted,
even after the conductor's raucous
shouting and the slowly moving
wheels had caused her to feel she had
started on ber journey to care. To
end where? To find what? She cared
not only to know a satisfied longing
and find something she had missed.
Could it be found anywhere on this
earth? Slowly, as with an effort, she
opened her eyes and saw coming
down the aisle a youth of about eigh
teen; his strained, pallid face was
flushed with the exertion of running
' to catch and board the train. Almost
staggering under the burden of a
bulging rattan suit-case bis arms filled
with packages, folders and"Tand Sale
literature, he came hesitatingly to
ward where the was seated. Looking
anxiously to each side as he came
along be failed to find a vacant place
or a kindly, unselfish thought from
any of the occupants of the over-filled
seats. Instantly Into' her mind came
the kindly thought, some mother's
boy, and she smiled up to him. Quickly
he came to her seat and in a breath
less, pleading voice asked, "May I be
seated?" As she answered, her eyes
filled with tears, for she thought of
her boys at home. "Yes, you may,
and very welcomejoo." With a long
drawn sigh of relief he sat down de
positing his luggage at their feet.
"Oh!" he said, "It seems so good to
find a seat. I had to burry so. I
haven't, any mother or any one to
help me and I wanted to come so
much. You see, I am not very strong
and now that I have a seat I can rest
quite a while before I get to the place
I am going." In a low, sweet voice
she, asked, "But where are you going
to?" "Oh, I am going, don'tyou see,
down to Ironton to the land sale.
We have bought a little tract ofxlund
and we are going down there to live,
It will be glorious. I will get well and
strong again and may bo won't ever
have to go back t.o the city. Do yon
know, I thought of my mother when
I saw you, so I came right straight to
you. My sister is coming down, too,
when she sells our things. She has
planned a lot for me. We are very
poor, but, Ohl we are going to live
now and be so happy."
As she looked at this youth bravely
fighting for a chance to escape the
slowly creeping shadow o' the grimly
waiting specter, from -ber doubting
heart went out this cry: "Is there
God? Why has he neglected us all
so? Why the blight on this poor boy?
This weariness and unsatisfied longing
of all my life?" Eerlife, too, bad been
one of hardship, privation and sacri
fices. Why must It always be so? As
be talked of bis plans for the future,
the work he would do, the joy he ex
pected with the thoughtof Qod some
where to be found that would help
them, the morning passed. Nervous
ly watching for the first glimpse of
the expected haven he, at last, eager
ly exclaimed. . "Look I seel there is
old Pilot Knob, and there Is Shepherd
Mountain, the portals to tbe Ozarks;

convention God's power aud presence
was manifested in a most marvelous
way.
Tuesday night there was a grand
diamond medal contest held in the
great auditorium and though there
was a heavy down pour of rain all day
Tuesday and continued through the
night, the house was crowded to the
limit. There were four contestants
ranging from 15 to 50 years of age.
Dallas Beacher, of Sikeston, Mo,
won the medal. He has won the
silver, gold, grand-gold', diamond
and now the grand diamond medal
and is only 15 years of age.
Wednesday morning the convention
proper commenced.? And as I sat in
that great auditorium and saw that
vast delegation 'o!lbbIe womiu, and
most of them mothers, I said, "O

Big Reduction in Hog Serum.
A reduotion of nearly 20 per cent in
the cost of bog cholera serum from
the University of Missouri Serum
Plant at Columbia to be used by Mis
souri farmers, has been announced by
the Miss6url College of Agriclture.
The plant established nnder an act of
the Legislature in 1913 has been com
pleted and is now able to furnish the
torum necessary for the protection of
all hogs in the state.
During the past summer new
laboratory equipment has been added
to the serum plant, experience has
added to the efficiency of the manu
faoturlng processes, and the redaction
ln the price of serum to the farmer is
, the result. The plant is now as com
plete and modern as any in the coun
try. Hog cholera is most prevalent in
Missouri from September to March,
but there is no longer danger ot the
loss of all hogs in any community or
country If the ordinary precautionary
method of inoculation is UBed. After
the serum has been obtained it can be
administered by the farmer, a vet
erinarian or a representative of the
College of Agriculture. The farmer
can do the work himself after he- has
seen an expert carry it out.
Since the establishment of the plant
at tne University 1,000,000 doses of
the serum have been sent out, repre
senting 850,000 bogs saved, the value
of which is established at from 88,
000,000 to 910,000,000.
In 1915 there were 153,588 hogs
treated with the cholera serum, mean
ing an estimated saving to tbe state
of 91,105,000. The preventive methods
were used ln 00 of the 111 eounties of
Missouri. In 1908-09, during tbe first
working year of the plant, only 12,000
doses were sent oat.
f f it was not for the use of the hog
cholera serum the annual loss to Mis
souri from the disease would be from
92,000,000 to. 95,000,000. Of tbe 4,000,
000 hogs In the state 20 per cent may
be affected, and of this 20 per cent H5
per cent can be saved by treatment
before reaching the advanced stage
of the disease.
