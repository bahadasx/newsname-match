Thought Irving Couldn't Act.
Edwin Booth told one story of Ir
ving that revealed a tragedy in that
gifted man's life. One day, as they
were sitting in Booth's room in the
theater, the latter was handed a letter.
Irving casually remarked that he rec
ognized the handwriting. Booth offer
ed it to him and asked him if he cared
to read it. Fortunately the English
mau declined. Mr. P>ootb opened it
and read the following from Mrs. Hen
ry Irving:
Dear Mr. Booth—Can you spare me a
oox? I should like to have my sons Bee
what good acting is.
During my first season with Booth
quite by accident I found myself In a
boarding house in San Francisco kept
by a very sweet, quaint, old English
lady who was an aunt of Henry Ir
ving's, and she told me that Mrs. lr
viug had been known to occupy a box
at her husband's performances and
ostentatiously read a newspaper dur
ing the performance —Edwin M. Roylo
in Harper's Magazine.
A Moneyless Man.
A man without money is a body with
out n'sdhl.'n talking "defith, a specter
that frightens every one. His counte
nance is sorrowful and his conversa
tion languishing and tedious. If he
calls upon an acquaintance he never
finds him at home, and if he opens his
mouth to speak he is Interrupted every
moment so that he may not have a
chance to finish his discourse, which it
Is feared may end with his asking for
money. He is avoided like a person
infected with disease nnd is regarded
as an Incumbrance to the earth. Want
wakes him up in the morning, and mis
cry accompanies him to bed at night
The ladies discover that he is an awk
ward booby, landlords believe thnt he
lives upon air, and if he wants any
thing from a tradesman he is asked
for cash before delivery. — Bruno's
Weekly.
Genius and Mediocrity.
Corneille did not speak correctly the
language of which he was such a mas
ter. Descartes was silent In mixed
society. Theinistocles, when asked to
piny on a lute, said, "I cannot fiddle,
but 1 can make a little village into a
great city." Addison was unable to
converse in company. Vergil was heavy
colloquially. La Fontaine was coarse
and stupid when surrounded by men.
The Countess of Pembroke had been
often heard to say of Chancer that his
silence was more agreeable to her than
his conversation. Socrates, celebrated
for his written orations, was so timid
that be never ventured to speak in
public, neuce it has been remarked,
"Mediocrity can talk; it is for genius
to observe."

It was the French King Louis XL
who invented gold lace, and it was
Louis XIV. who ordered all the silk
upholsteries of the palace done in
white with figures of gold and blue

are named after him, and all the

The Chief a Victim of His
Own Brutality
By
ALFRED DAMON RUNYON
Copyright Frank A. Munsey Co.
"1 don't like to hit you, John." said
the chief, fondling a piece of thick,
solid rubber tire and glancing down at
the man who cowered at his feet. "I
don't like to hit you at all. You come
In like a good fellow, and it will be all
right."
"I ain't got nothin' to come in wit',
chief," whined the man. "I'm tellin'
you true. I wasn't there. I couldn't 'a'
been, there. I hadn't got in town."
The chief, a huge fellow, who seemed
about ready to burst out of his gold
bedecked uniform, reached down and
picked the man up by the collar.
"I gave you a chance, John." he said
his- voice almost soothing.
He raised his free arm and snapped
it sharply in the air. The piece of tire
swished forward like a buggy whip and
struck the man in the face with a brisk
slap.
The chief released his grasp, and the
man dropped to the floor and rolled
over and over like a shot rabbit It was
not a hard blow; it was a blow struck
with the knowledge of long experience.
The man was "out."
The chief sat down at his desk and
glared at the silent form. A firm be
Uever in the efficacy of physical pun
ishment to break a man's nerve, he
took a savage delight iu 'fetich scenes
as this. And yet they afforded him a
problem that he had puzzled over many
times.
"Why should a man be afraid of a
little beating?" he had often remarked.
"The average criminal has a good deal
of courage; there is no doubt about
that. Thejj are certainly not afraid of
death, because they face it in a hun
dred different forms every time they
undertake a crime.
"Then why Is it that the toughest,
most hardened criminal cannot take
little physical punishment? I've seen
men who had reputations from coast
to coast as man killers and daring
crooks break down the moment they
get« slap in the face. Am? ten minutes
before, or ten minutes afterward, they
would go out and kill an innocent per
son with no more thought of it than
eating their dinner.
"They're not afraid of death iu here.
They know we won't go so far as to
kill them. They know—or they ought
to know—that if they took their beat
Ing and kept their mouths shut we
couldn't, in nine cases out of ten. con
vict them."
The chief was a brave man. too—
physically, at least. lie had won pro
mol.on through personal daring. He
had jeopardized his life a score of
times iu the performance of ills duty
He was becoming a trifle angry, for
the prisoner was unusually obdurate.
"Now, John." he said, his voice
little harder than before, "I don't want
to hurt you, but you've got to come In
That's all."
He rose nnd dealt the man it kick
"Oh, don't, chief!" whined the man
his voice rising. "Please don't, chief!'
Slowly the chief twisted the wrist,
and the man's «face grew purple. His
voice rose to a scream.
"Oh, please don't, chief!" he shrieked
He tried to fall to (he floor, but fbe
chief held him upright. Suddenly the
officer's left hand shot out. and there
was a sharp smack as it came in con
tact with the man's jaw. Again the
man dropped to the floor, unconscious
and the chief sat down.
"Faking it, eh?" growled the chief

screamed in agony.
"I'll come in. chief!" ho.yelled dis

Breathing somewhat heavily, t.be

bell. A uniformed sergeant appeared
at the door.

chief. "John's decided to make a con

chief <•
"I tell you. Sullivan, Tiinzie must
have had wings to get here in time to
turn that trick. I didn't spring him till
the day before the murder. You know
it's hardly probable, even if it is pos
sible, for a man to make that trip un
der forty-eight hours." ■ '
"Yl'ell, lie says he did. You can't go
back of that." replied the chief.
"Was he drunk?" asked the warden.
"Well, he'd been drinking a little."
said the chief. "He wasn't drunk when
he came through." *,
"There's something strange about
it," remarked the warden. "If he says
he did, I guess he did, but"—
The warden took his departure, not
so much puzzled as annoyed, because
the warden had talked with many pris
oners who had been through the ciders
'sweating" process and had dropped a
ood many pounds in weight at it too.
The warden had his suspicions, but it
wouldn't do to express them.
In the meantime the newspapers
were paying much attention to John
Kinzie. former convict, whd had con
fessed to the murder of a prominent
citizen, shot dowu in cold blood be
cause he resisted a holdup.
"Huh!" remarked big "Red" Sim
mons, nfter he had laboriously read an
account of the confession. "If it was
raining money that guy Kinzie'd bo
under a shed somewhere. He's the un
luckiest stiff I ever see."
"Small" Gordon wrinkled his fox ter
ier nose into an appreciative grin.
"He fell for the third degree fine."
continued Simmons. ^
"How do you s'pose they come to
light on him?" asked Gordon.
'now? W'y. the chief gets his little
list of guys released from the big skoo
kuin every day. don't he?' said Sim
mons. "Kinzie happened to be the
only one sprung just before this job,
and so the chief tells his elbows to
fetch in Kinzie the moment he lands
in town."
'Too bad you had to croak that
guy," said Gordon.
"Too bad for Kinzie," answered Sim
mons briefly.
Simmons, a giant fellow, with i
strong, massive face and fierce eyes,
rolled a cigarette with calm fingers,
and Gordon, little and rat eyed, ate in
businesslike fashion.
"Wot'!! they do to Kinzie?' asked
Gordon between mouthfuls.
"Oh, they'll nnly swihg him up a lit
tie." replied Simmons sarcastically
Gordon shivered.
"They can't prove he did it." he sug
gested. •
"And he can't prove he didn't," said
Simmons.
They walked out into the brilliantly
lighted street nnd were sauntering
slowly along, when Gordon nervously
clutched at the arm of his companion.
"Nix! Nix!" said Simmons between
his teeth. "I saw him-. Wot's the mat
ter with you, anyhow?"
The chief of police, in civilian cloth
ing, passed them with a number of
women nnd a couple of children. The
chief was carrying a big suit case in
either hand, and the women böre grips
and bundles
"Going to the depot," remarked Sim
mons, after the party passed. "That
woman in black is the big guy's wife.
Saw her at headquarters once when 1
was in explaining.'
The two turned Into a saloon, rather
notorious for the class to which it ca
tered, and ordered drinks. As they were
standing at the bar a flashily dressed
individual approached them. He was
known as "Boston Carey" and was a
pickpocket of some renown among his
kind, but an object of some contempt
to Simmons nnd Kinzie, who dealt In
more hazardous enterprises.
"Just in time." said Simmons. Carey
ordered beer.
"See they picked up John Kiuzie for
that hill job." he remarked casually
Simmons merely nodded.
"I used to know him in the east.'
continued the garrulous Carey, not no
ticing Simmons' frown. "He was go
ing back there and be decent, I heard
but I guess his foot slipped.
Still Simmons and Gordon remained
silent.
"no's got a wife and kid here," said
Carey.
"What?" demanded Simmons and
Gordon together.
. "A wife and kid," repeated Carey
pleased at having roused some inter
est. "They came on here to meet him.
Kinzie made a little money peddling
these horsehair bridles while he was
up yonder, and they were all going
back together."
"Where are they now?" demanded
Simmons.
"Oh, somewhere round town," said
Carey carelessly. "I guess it's all off
with Kinzie. ain't it? Wot'd the stiff
want to give up for, anyway?"
Simmons finished his liquor and nod
ded to Gordon.
"See you later," he said to Carey
and Gordon followed him out into the
street
"Jemmy," said Simmons, Unking
avms with his little partner, "if we
was like these guys you read about
we'd go to the chief and tell him the
low down on this business."
Gordon looked alarmed.
"Let's don't." he said.
Simmons laughed so loudly that
passers!>y turned to look at the pair.
"Don't get scared." he said reassur
ingly. "But if we was story book
crooks we'd do something grand and
.noble for Kinzie nnd his wife and
kid."
"Wot could we do. anyhow?" asked
Gordon.
"Well, we could go see the chief,
-said Simmons.
Simmons and Gordon had decided on
the City of Mexico as tiroir next stop
ping place. Red looked at his under
size:! partner in amuspd fashion and
changed the subject.
Along toward midnight frequent li
bations bad put them both in a very
amiable mood. Gordon, the cautious,
reverted to the proposal which Sim
mons had forgotten.
"Let's go see the chief. Red," he
suggested finally. "We've got an hour
and a half yet to make a little call
and I owe him one."
Without reply Simmons turned and
led the way up a side street
The chief in a huddle of bcdclothing
awoke to the grip of a strong hand
clutching the neck of his pajamas.
"What—what!" he gurgled sleepily,
opening his eyes.
"Keep still," commanded Simmons,
taking an extra twist.
"Wliat the"— growled the chief.
"Shut up!" said Simmons, slapping
him again. "And get up." he added,
hauling the big man out of the covers
as a hoy jerks a ground squirrel from
its hole.
The chief knew both Simmons anti
Gordon. Ho knew them as desperate
crooks. lie knew that human life was
one of the things they held very cheap
ly indeed. And yet they were the very
type he held in contempt because he
knew their weak points.
"What's the matter with you fel
lows?" he asked quietly.
"We come to tell you Kinzie didn't
do that hill job," said Red.
"I know it" replied the chief. "But
that's no skin off you, is it? I don't
doubt you guys know something about
it, but I didn't have nothing on you."
Remember the lime you dumped me
for the Carson robbery that 1 didn't
do?" demanded Simmons. "Beat me
up n little, too, if you recollect."
'Now. Red"— began the chief in
conciliatory tone.
Red slapped him so viciously that the
big man almost fell over.
We're going away, chief," said Sim
mons. "We're going away for good.
THE CHIEF STOOD TRANSFIXED.
but we thought we'd pay you a final
call just to tell you that you've got the
wrong man in Kinzie."
He was lashing himself into a rage,
and the chief trembled, but it was from
the chill of the room.
These men were displaying some
thing entirely foreign to all his years
of criminal observation. He did not
fear them personally, but the new and
unknown element in their composition
disturbed him.
The chief did not fear death. He did
not believe the men intended killing
him. In fact, he felt certain they did
not
What was it. then, that he feared?
He did not know it, hut in his eyes
was the same expression that had been
in the eyes of the man on the floor of
his office that morning.
Simmons suddenly began moving to
ward the chief, his great hands work
Ing like claws and his lips parted in a
vast snarl. No word was spoken. The
chief stood transfixed, unable to utter
a sound. He felt himself wondering
what the big man intended dojng.
A great fear stirred within him. He
wasn't afraid of Simmons; that was
certain. He was simply afraid because
he did not know what the man meant
to do. Something seemed to suddenly
give way inside the chieFs breast as
Simmons moved toward him. Expres
sion dropped from his face like a mask,
and he backed up, laughing hideously.
Simmons stopped. Gordon peered
around his leg like a little dog.
"Let's get out of here!" yelled the
small man. with a backward leap.
"Look at that face!"
Squealing in terror, he fled, and Sim
mons lumbered after him, while l»e
hind them they heard the horrible
chattering laugh of the chief.
*•*«•*•
In a cafe in Mexico City Red Sim
mous and Small Gordon sat at a table
piled high with American newspapers
"Here you are!" announced Red after
another silence broken only by the rat
tling of the papers. He read:
'John Kinzie. who once confessed to
the murder of John Moore, a prominent
citizen, and afterward repudiated the
confession, claiming it was obtained
under duress, was today acquitted by a
jury in the criminal court after a short
trial. The inability of former Chief of
Police Sullivan to testify is declared by
the district attorney to be the principa'
reason why he could not produce evi
deuce sufficient to convict Kinzie. but
the prisoner proved a complete alibi
through the testimony of Warden
Pierce of the state penitentiary."
"Yes, but listen here." said Gordon
so excitedly that Simmons gave him a
warning look:
"Former Chief of Police Sullivan,
whose nn fortunate and very mvsteri
-ous case lias roused great sympathy,
was last night removed to the state in
sane asylum at Corbin. The physicians
declare his reason lias gone forever."
BY GOOD ROADS
Better Highways Gan Accom
plish Still More.
TO INCREASE FARM VALUES.
Bad Roads Increase the High Cost of
Living—Better Highways Would Ac
complish Great Savings In the Cost
of Handling Freight and In Many
Other Ways.
In a recent address before the Na
tional Highways association its presi
dent, Charles Henry Davis, C. E. t said
iu part:
The problem of roads is an old one.
It has been one of our great national
problems ever since we have been a
nation and have had national prob
lems. It is a fundamental contributing
cause for many other social ills besides
the high cost of living. And during re
cent years the nation—all the people—
has been coming to a greater and
greater realization of the problem un
til now the cry from east to west and
north to south is for "good roads every,
where."
It has been estimated that more tbau
5,000,000,000 tons of freight per annum
pass over all the highways of this coun
try. It is also estimated that the aver
age haul is a little under ten miles
and that the cost is about 23 cents per
ton mile. This cost should not exceed
8 cents per ton mile on a good road. Iu
other words, at least $1.50 should be
saved on every ton moved on our high
ways. Thus the total saving from good
roads staggers the Imagination.
Seven and a half billions of dollars
per annum! This would build fifteen
Panama canals a year or 1,500 dread
naughts a year. It would build all of
the 250,000 miles of railroads in the
United States in a period of three
years. It represents one-quarter of the
entire annual wealth produced by this
great nation.
This is no raving of the imagination.
It is no wild theory. It is bàsed on
cold, hard facts.
Let us look at another, phase of the
situation. The value of farm real es
tate and buildings is '"$35,OO0,OOGJ)OO
for the United States. Two million
miles of improved highways will in
crease land values $10,000,000,000 or
approximately an Increase of one-third
above present values. Does this indi
cate we cannot afford to improve our
reads? There are 0,500,000 farms.
This means that the average increase
of vaine for each farm would "be
$1,500. At $100 a year per farm we
would have a sum of $050,000,000 per
annum with which to improve our
highways. This would build 130.000
miles a year at $5,000 a mile or less
than twenty years within which to
improve all our highways. In this
time they would many times pay for
themselves in savings and in increased
land values.
Still another view: There are about
1,000,000 automobiles iu the United
States. Estimating an average of
twenty-five miles a day for 300 work
ing days we get a mileage of 7.500,
000,000 per annum. At 15 cents
mile operating expenses the total ex
ceeds $ 1 , 000 , 000,000 a year—a goodly
sum. Will not good roads save 10 per
cent of this? We think more—much
more. This means not less than $10(X'
000,000 per aunum saving.
There are 27,000.000 horses, mules,
etc., and more than 4,000,000 horse
drawn vehicles in the United States,
more than 2,000,000 bicycles and more
than 100.000 motorcycles. These, with
the automobiles, arc valued at more
than $5,000,000,000. If from good roads
only 10 per cent in depreciation per
annum were saved it would amount to
the enormous sum of $500.000.000
every year. How long would it take
us to give our great country good roads
from nortli to south and cast to west
out of such savings?
Public spirit Is awakening to these
facts. Tliis is evidenced by some fifty
major good roads or allied associations,
500 state and local organizations and
an equal number of automobile clubs
devoting most of their activities to the
movement. Much hard work has been
done which deserves much credit. But
what has been accomplished? Wliat
plans have been advanced, and what
really effective work has been done?
Public spirit is slow—wavering—in
Its movement if not guided by a shin
ing lieaeon light of fearless leader
ship. We need to crystallize sentiment.
We need action. Each year lost means
millions of dollars wasted. We need a
plan to follow, and public sentiment
will push It along.

Military Road on Border.
The War college is giving considéra
tion to a plan for a military highway
along the Mexican border from Browns
ville, Tex., to San Diego, Cal.
The plan is one worked out by the
good roads department of the Ameri
can Automobile association. The pro
posal is to take advantage of the sec
tion of the $85.000,000 good roads act
signed by the president recently, which
provides for mil'tary as well as post
roads.
The principal purpose would be to
enable rapid concentration of troops at
any desired point along the border,
thing not now possible. The states
would be repaid. It Is said, by tourist

RULES FOR DRAGGING.
Concise Advice From an Authoritative
Source.
The following rules are given by the
Illinois highway commission:
Use a light drag.
Haul it over the road at an angle so
that a small amount of earth is pushed
to the center of the road.
Drive the team ut a walk.
Bide on the drag; do not walk.
Begin at one side of the road, re
turning up the opposite side.
Drag the road as soon after every
rain as possible, but not when the mud

is in such a condition as to stick to
the drag.
Do not drag a dry road.
Drag whenever possible at all sea
sons of the year.
The width, of traveled way to be
maintained by the drag should tie from
eightecu to twenty feet. First drag a
little more than the width of a single
wheel track, then gradually increase
until desired width is obtained.
Always drag a little earth toward
the center of the road until it is raised
from ten to twelve inches above tho
edges of the traveled way.
The amount of earth that the drag
will curry along can bo very consider
ably controlled by the driver, accord
ingly as he stands near the cutting end
or away from it.
When the roads nre first dragged
after a very muddy «vieil the wagons
should drive, if possible, to one sido
until the roadway has a chance to
freeze or partially dry out.
The best results from dragging are
obtained only by repeated application.
Remember that constant attention is
necessary to maintain an earth road in
its best condition.
Room For Improvement.
Tliere are over 400,000,000 acres of
uncultivated land in tho United States
awaiting development that cannot be
developed without improved highways.
It has been shown that the value of
land Is increased evenly with the Im
provement for the roads, the increase
running from $2 to $0 the acre. As
the roads are improved there Is a cor
responding Increase in population. In
twenty-five counties taken at random
which have contained on an average
only 1V6 per cent of improved roads in
the decade 1890 to 1900 there was a
falling off in population of 3.000 in
»ach. Undoubtedly the best system of
maintenance for all roads is that
which provides for tho permanent and
sometimes continuous employment of
skilled laborers who have charge of
particular sections of road or who may
be assigned to any part of the county
or other road unit where there Is work
most needed.
