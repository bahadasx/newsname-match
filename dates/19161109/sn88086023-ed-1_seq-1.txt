COUNTY GAVE NORMAL BILL A
BETTER THAN TWO TO 1 VOTE,
DRY MEASURE DEFEATED HERE
Umatilla county gave the Tendleton
normal school bill better than a two
to one vote. Complete returns from
62 out of the 64 precincts give 466,1
votes for and 21TS against me meas
ure. The two precincts yet to report
are in Freewater, which, Judging
from the neighboring precincts, will
be against the bill bo that the present
lead of 238D will probably be cut
down a little.
This county took a healthy swat at
the full rental land tujt amendment,
which bore a similarity to single tax.
lteturns-from 41 precincts show a ma
jority of almost 1600 against the
measure. The brewers' amendment
was also snowed under In this coun
ty, a two to one vote showing In the
incomplete returns. The total dry
taaarar la running neck and neck
with the negatives having a Blight lead
In 41 precincts.
The measure for the repeal of the
Sunday closing law Is also having a
tight pull The Nnca have a slight ad.

was given a good majority In Uma

tion seems to be winning i.y a emu ii
margin.
Umatilla county did not cost an In
telligent vote on the negro and mu
latto suffrage amendment. The
measure was designed to repeal an ob.
solete section of the Oregon constitu
tion which bars the negro and mulat
to from voting. Inasmuch as the civil
war gave him the right the section is
at variance with the federal constitu
tion. However, Umatilla county cast
a negative majority on the measure.
The rural credits amendment and
the tax and Indebtedness limitation
amendment nre running close. Od
the former the Yeses have a slight
majority and on the latter the Noes

WASHINGTON IN
DRY COLUMN
Sufferers who attempt to drown
sorrow merely Irrigate it.
That Washington remains
firmly in the dry column is as-
sured. The Kast Oregon receiv- 4
ed a phone report this afternoon
from the Wallu Wulla Bulletin
stating that a summary of the 0
Wimhlnarton state vote on the two
luiuor amendments shows that 4)
both were badly defeated in all
parts of the state. One am-
endnient had been submitted by
the brewers, the other by the 4
hotelmen.
The controversy between the Stand
ard oil Co. and property owners in
the vicinity of the local plant of the
company had an airing last evening
before the council and may be set
tled at a special meeting this evening.
L. G. Fruzier aud his sister. Miss
Kfft'e Jean Fraiier. presented a re
monstrance against the granting of a
permit to the Standard Oil Co. to
move their tanks on to a lot in front
of the Fraiier property. They were
represented by Charles H. Carter who
imbued nut that the plans of the com.
pany. if carried out, would reduce the
alue of the Frailer property besidei
increasing the fire risk.
t-ni. .r H. Rale.v represented the
company and stated that the company
had altered its oriclnal plans so tniu
the tanks would not be as close to
the Fraiier house if moved as they
are at present. However, Mr. Fra
aier still objected to the relocating o
the tanks. The company had Intro
duced an ordinance which grants per
mission for the removal and main
tenance of the tanks as desired and
which would hold the city harmless
in case of damage to private prop
erty In case of fire.
The ordinance was not voted upon
but it was aereed that before any ac
tlon was taken that the entire coun
cil together with the two parties to
the controversy would look over th
situation this morning, and that ths
council would meet this evening to
make a decision.
