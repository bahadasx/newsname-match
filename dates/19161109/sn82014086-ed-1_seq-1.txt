which was as high as 10,000 early in

HUGHES MAY HAVE ONE
VOTE FROM WAS HINGTON
Through Confusion Resulting from
Death of m Demooratio Elector.
Tacoma, Wash., Nov. 8. There ap
pears to be a possibility that, al
though President' Wilson carried
Washington, Hughes may get one of
the seven electoral votes of the state.
The death of A. Stream, a democratic
elector, shortly before election and the
substitution of E. M. Connor as elect
or came so late that in many coun
ties the name of Etream rather than
Connor appeared on the ballot. It U
said -that many voted for Stream and
that these votes, will be invalid. The
difference according to local republi
cans will be Invalid. The difference
according to local republicans will be
sufficient to give one renublican elect
or a plurality.

Political Leaders
EAGERLY AWAITING RETURNS
FROM DOUBTFUL STATES.
BOTH CLAIM VICTORY
Crowds Gathered in Front of Newspa
per Offices in New York, Scanning
the Bulletins as Posted Wilson Ad
herents Had a Celebration.
New York, Nov. 8 Tireless vigils
were kept by anxious watchers tonight
at headquarters of both the demo
cratic and republican national com
mittees. Bulletins from states in
which the results are still in doubt
were scanned even more eagerly than
they were last night.
Both Chairmen Profess Confidence.
Both chairmen, Vance C. McCor
mick for the democrats, and William
R. Willcox, for the republicans, pro
fessed undiminished confidence in the
outcome. The former was somewhat
more explicit in his claims but the lat
ter declared, after dining with Charles
E. Hughes, that the nominee agreed
with him that the republicans had
been successful.
"We ask only what is fair," declared
Mr. Willcox. "We want only what we
are entitled to and that we propose
to have."
Earlier in the day Mr. McCormick
had announced that he had sent tele
grams to state and county chairmen
in doubtful states, directing them to
keep careful guard over the ballot
boxes and their contents.
Attorney-General Gregory u3ited
democratic headquarters and was
closeted with the chairman but it was
asserted his visit was of no special
significance. Late in the afternoon
Mr. McCormick conferred with John
B. Stanchfield and Delaneey Nicoll,
prominent democratic lawyers.
. Possibility of Recounts.
The possibility of an official count
being necessary in states where the
margin of apparent victory for one
presidential candidate or the other, is
slight, was freely discussed, at both
headquarters. It was .pointed out that
if the house of representatives became
the court of last resort in the election
of a president the present- house and
not the one elected yesterday would
sit in judgment. No formal state
ments on the subject of a recount were
made by either side, however.
Leaders of both parties in all parts
of the country especially in the west,
were in constant touch by telegraph
and telephone with headquarters in
this city. They sought information,
imparted such "news as they had and
were-given--instructions, if they- Were
required.
Apparently thTank and file of Wil
son adherents who had no opportu
nity to celebrate last night were de
termined to make up tonight for what
they had missed. A crowd of such
proportions that it blocked traffic for
blocks in 42nd street gathered In front
of democratic headquarters. Two
bands joined forces in playing The
Star Spangled Banner and all kinds of
noise-making implements were used
enthusiastically. The crowd announced
its intention of parading all over the
city.
Crowds Watch Bulletins.
Crowds gathered in front of news
paper offices Ecanning the bulletins
posted and again watching the towers
from which searchlights had flashed
last night the supposed result of the
election in the evidenct expectation
that additional signals would be dis
played. RECOUNT TO BE DEMANDED
IN NEW HAMPSHIRE
By the Democratic State Committee
To Retain Counsel.
Concord, N. H., Nov. 8. A recount
of the vote for presidential electors in
this state will be demanded by the
democratic state . committee, according
to information received tonight. It
was learned that on account of the
closeness of the result, the committee
was directed by the national commit
tee to call for a recount at once and
to obtain the best available counsel to
assist in the work. The national
committee is said to have guaranteed
all the expense of the recount aside
from that which in the regular course
of events would fall upon the. state.
As far as is known here, no charge of
rraua nas oeen made.
Complete returns announced by
Secretary of State Edwin C. Bean to
night give Hughes a plurality of 161,
the smallest plurality ever returned in
a presidential contest in the state. Mr.
Bean did not make public the total
figures for each candidate, but it is
understood that his statement of the
plurality, although unofficial, was
based on official returns.
In apparent contradiction of that
announcement, George E. Ferrand,
charman of the democratic state com
mittee gave out figures Indicating a
small pluraity for Wilson. Chairman
Ferrand's statement said that with 13
smal ltowns missing Wilson had
42,464 votes; Hughes 42,326.
Newspaper figures, with two small
towns in the White Mountain missing,
gave Hughes a lead of 524.

Berlin, Nov. 8 (Via Wireless to Say

November fiftlfl'is thus characterized
by the war correspondent of the Ber
liner Tagebiatt, according to the Over
seas News agency, which quotes from
the article as follows:
"Again the British shortened their
sector, but even on the shortened front
the British were forced to engage a
division of minor value, which was
sent against positions tnat could not
be reached by picked men even at the
cost of destruction.
"On this day also an attack near
Gueudecourt could not be launched in
consequence of the German curtain of
fire which held the troops in the
trenches and swept the ground where
assemblies were taking place with
great certainty. The French finally
were able to develop attacks at cer
tain places. Evidemly in order to an
imate the courage of the men in the
trenches, rather than from the at
tempt to break would succeed, the en

During his ride the president passed
through Asbury Park, where the ex

recognized by many and cheered. One

tically that he had been re-elected.
He raised his hat and bowed, smiling
broadly. Mrs. Wilson accompanied

The president kept his own tabula

up carefully after eacn report from

A FEW WESTERN STATES
WILL DECIDE ELECTION
No Assurance That Result Will Be
Fully Known in Another Day.
New York, Nov. 9. On the second
day after the American people cast
their presidential ballots the result
still is in doubt and the contest be
tween President Wilson and Charles
Evans Hughes has narrowed down to
a point where it may be decided by a
few western states.
It is within the range of possibili
ties that the votes of national guards
men on border duty might turn some
of the doubtful states from one col
umn to another.
Based on actual returns received by
The Associated Press, the electoral
college now gives Hughes 239 votes,
Wilson 232 and leaves sixty doubtful.
Two of the metropolitan newspapers
which supported Mr. Hughes give him
252 votes. President Wilson 251 and
admit the doubtful character of only
California, New Mexico and Minnesota.
Another which supported the presi
dent, agrees with its contemporaries
in giving him 251 votes but concedes
Mr. Hughes only 228 and regards the
others in seve nstates as doubtful.
Each of the national chairmen ex
presses the most serene confidence
that the ultimate results will elect his
candidate.
With the contest narrowing down
steadily to close votes in the vital
spots, recounts are almost inevitable
and each side is on the watch for ir
regularities. There is no assurance that the re
sult will be fully known in another
day.
ESTIMATES GIVEN BY
NEW YORK NEWSPAPERS
Tribune and Sun Gave Hughes 252,
Wilson 251.
New York, Nov.' 9. The Tribune and
Sun, which supported Mr. Hughes,
give him 252 votes in the electoral
college and give President Wilson 251.
They regard California, Minnesota and
New Mexico as the only doubtful
states.
The World, which supported Presi
dent Wilson, gives him 251, Hughes
228 and regards California, Connecti
cut, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New
Mexico, North Dakota and West Vir
ginia as doubtful.
The Times gives Wilson 251 votes
and Hughes 247, classing California,
Minnesota, New Mexico and North
Dakota as doubtful.
intended, were to cross the destroyed
trenches of the opposing force and roll
up from where the breach was made
the German front north and south.
"This great thrust resulted in a
great day of death for the storming
columns. They entered the German
trenches only to the northeast and
southeast of Sailly, where they were
defeated in a sanguinary hand-to-hand
fighting, while other storming columns
in complete disorder fell back to their
own trenches.
"Three times a hopeless attack
against Le Transloy was launched.
The French troops were decimated by
the German fire and the attempts were
then abandoned. The Somme district
presented a terrifying field of dead. The
German artillery fire was excellent
everywhere against the troops in the
crowded trenches. It routed the cav
alry squadrons and broke down field
batteries which had been only waiting
for the signal to attack.
"The French also suffered heavy de
feats in the powerful engagements be
tween Lesars and Bouchavesnes."
HUGHES LEADING IN
INDIANA BY 8,000
But Democratic State Headquarter
Refuses to Acknowledge Defeat.
Indianapolis, Ind., Nov. 8. Al
though Hughes was leading by more
than 8,000 with only 382 of the 3,143
precincts in the state unaccounted for,
the democratic state headquarters to--night
refused to conede a vitory to the
republican candidates in the state. The
republican candidates for governor and
United States senator, with smaller
number of precincts reported, showed
larger pluralities than did the presi
dential candidates.
According to unofficial returns,
Hughes has been in the lead in Indi
ana ever since the tabulation - of the
vote, but his lead ranging around
15,000 early last night, had dwindled
tonight to a little more than 8,000.
With Hughes in the lead all the time,
residents of Indialna seemed to lose
interest in this state, but swamped
newspaper offices with inquiries re
garding California, Minnesota and oth
er doubtful states. Congressional re
turns indicated the republicans would
have eight representatives i nthe low
er house and democrats three with
the contest undecided in the first and
eleventh districts.
The prohibitionists and socialists
vote with complete returns from 22
of the 92 counties in the state was not
so large as was expected, it was said
tonight. Both the prohibitionists and
socialist candidates for governor poll
ed larger votes than aid Hanly oid
Beniion. The progress e vote was
light.

tdday was D. F. Hurd of the chamber
of commerce of Cleveland. He de
clared many industrial and public ear-,
vice plants throughout a large section
of the north and northwest would be
soon forced to suspend operations un
less embargoes upon the movement of
their cars to foreign lines are lifted
by the southern coal-carrying roads.

to return other cars when empty, ac

roads involved.
