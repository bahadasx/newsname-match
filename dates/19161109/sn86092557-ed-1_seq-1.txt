BRITISH STORES
MUST CLOSE EARLY

h*nrr?>;??mlrnee Assn.-Intr.I !'mss1 |
LONDON. Oct. 23.?Tile latest ilrnsj
tic act fur government control of busi- j
ncss in the interest of war efficiency |
is Hit; law passed by parliumeni for |
early closing of shops. All shop keepers.
great and small, must shut their
places of business at eight o'clock, ex- j
ccpt on Saturday night, when they
may keep open until nine. The first!
proposal was to even earlier closing,'
hut the hill was amended to grant an j
extra hour for five days of ihc vveek.i
uy i iiaimiug hu>?*u iu cigui.
The chief objec t aimed at is economy I
of heating and lighting, which of
course means economy of coal. One
of I ho great, assets of Great Britain
during the war is its revenue from the
export a ion oi coal, and moreover its
allies need all they can get. Like every
other war measure, however, this
act excites opposition ami creates com
plications, although the people, as a
whole will.accept it cheerfully as they
have other inconveniences.
The small shop-keepers who live at
their place of business arc the ones
who find most objection. One ground
of criticism is that tho public houses
are still to he opened until half past
nine. "Why should men and women :
ho allowed to gather in drinking j
places and buy beer, if they cannot.
loaf in a cigar store and buy cigars. |
and gossip with tlie clerk?" is one of'
the ouostions asked. Places where
meals are served remain open, but
only for the purpose of giving meals.
They cannot sell cigars, nor can they
sell candy or food to lie taken off the
premises, since the shopkeepers dealing
in the same commodities are forbidden
lo soli. Nor can the night
hawks who have carts in the streets
for dispensing coffee and lunches to
late workers, according to some eon- j
struetions of the law, sell cakes to lie i
taken away.
Some of the complications concern j
places of 'amusement. "The theatres
and tntislc halls must not sell cigars'
and confectionary after eight o'clock I
il we cannot." say the small shopkeep j
ers. "That would be class legislation,
and unfair competition." Smokers wlttt
are up late, hereafter, must have tobacco
in their pockets, or go without.

and North Itukota with 5. t
Athough still so close that results <
could not he regarded as assured Indicative
overnight returns seemed to dispose
of previously doubtful states hy
placing Wost Virginia, S votes, in the \
Hughes column and giving the 4 votes i I
of Idaho and 7 from Washington to |,
President Wilson. The llugnes total
became 247 and Wilson 251. with 2lil? i
necessary to elect. '
After so disposing of those previous- i
ly doubtful states from which returns (
still are incomplete the situation ap- j
penred to be as follows:
President Wilson can win with eltii- ,
or California or Miunesota. but in addition
must get either North Dakota =
or New Mexico.
Mr. Hughes to win must have both
California and Minnesota or either one
and in addition both North Dakota and
New Mexico.
In California President WilBOn has
a lead of nearly 5,000 with one-tenth of
the precincts missing. Of the 670 missing
lta are in Republican strondholds
and the others arc In the north district
where the President's vote has been ;
heavy. Both party managers claim
the Btate.
In Minnesota the most dramatic race
of all is being run hour by hour. During
yesterday President Wilson's lead
of 10,000 slowly melted down before
the Hughes voto from rural districts
until it was wiped out. Then the Wilson
vote began coming in again only
to be offset by a Hughes burst and so
the contest whip sawod all night with
first one ?.cue and then the other.
Early today with about 500 precincts

less than 1,000. !
Mr. Wilson had a lead of over a'
thousand votes on the latest returns
from North Dakota with nearly 200
aiBuicts unreported. com party lead- .
era claim the election. 11
With the count half In for New Mexico
Mr. Hughes had a majority of lesB
than 300 voteB over President Wilson.
Returns from far lying districts are expected
to come In slowly today.
The latest returns from Washington
today apparently carried that state
Into the Democratic column. President
Wilson had a lead of over 9.000
votes In the latest figures with about
500 districts missing.
laaho was taken from the doubtful
column at an early hour and again given
to President Wilson who had a lead
of over 13,000 votee on later returns.
Less than 200 districts have not report- '
