MOTHER RAILROAD
Thut Swum to le tin Sure Pro,
pcctn for Mexico It's the Santa
Fe, and Xot the Burlington.
A few days ago the St. Louis Re
public contained the following:
The Santa Fe will enter St. Louis
in a few months. St. Louis will have
another railroad, one of the greatest
and largest In America, with more
than 11,000 miles of road. The ben
efits from the acquisition of this pro
digious system will be multifarious.
The Santa Fe Is a distinctive rail
roarl, and its territory, which is pe
culiarly Santa Fe territory, might
he designated by the world-wide
known and historic trade-mark of
the swastika emblem, bearing on the
horizontal crossplece Ihe name of the
small, old New Mexican town that
lent the big, modern railroad a win
ning, romantic, poetic title.
The averment that th,e Santa Fe
will enter St. Louis should be modi
fied into the assertion that the Santa
Fe already is in St. Louis. While it
is true a connecting line must be con
structed in Missouri, between Car
rollton and Mexico, before the sys
tem begins running its own trains
into St. Louis over its own tracks,
the fact is equally true, altho but lit
tle known, that the Santa Fe has
been the proprietor of terminal land
In St. Louis for three months.
Real estate transfers have not de
noted the deeding of property to the
Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Rail
way, which is the official title of the
company. But the land has been
bought and is held in trust by agents,
who will convey it to the road, prob
ably soon after the first of the year.
So, the statement is justified by
transacts ns so substantial as the ex
change of money for land that the
Santa Fe already Is in St. Louis.
The plan of the Santa Fe, and this
has been acknowledged by officers of
the company, Is to build the con
necting road between Carrollton and
Mexico and operate trains Into St.
Louis over the Burlington tracks
from Mexico.

With seven-eights of the total vote
cast in the State already in, Lamm
Is leading this afternoon by 1,500
votes. But Gardner is gaining and If

ning along close to Gardner. '
John P. Gordon, Democratic om-
inee for State Auditor, is hopelessly
beaten.

over the State. Reed ran along with
Wilson or ahead of Wilson, who will
carry the State by 12,000.
The Prohibition amendment was
'murdered." Definite results on the
other amendments are unobtainable
this afternoon, but it is believed
they were defeated overwhelmingly.
Prohibition carried in Jackson
County, despite the large vote cast in
Kansas City.

256 to 238.
NEW YORK, November 8.
At 4:15 this afternoon Democratic National Chairman McCormlck
stated Wilson absolutely and to a Vartainty is re-elected.
"They cannot beat him by anycombination," McCormlck said. "He
la elected whether he carries Minnes ta and California or not, but he will
carry both. "
Wilson is making steady gains this afternoon in two States, Califor
nia and Minnesota, either one of which will assure him the victory. These
States with New Hampshire, New Mexico and Oregon
are regarded as doubtful. Returns gathered bv the United
Press show Wilson has received 256 electoral votes to Hughes' 238
Democratic managers have regarded the victory as certain and have al
ready turned their attention to celebrating.
The New York World, which last night conceded Hughes' election
tonight claims the re-election or Wilson.
Tills afternoon Senator Hollis of New Hampshire telephoned from Burl
ington that unofficial but complete returns gave that State to Wilson by
350.
