' Many of the intelligent citizens
o! our State do pot know the size
or the spirit ot this movement.
It is immense! and significant.
It started in the early days of
our history as a State. It was
born outo! the sincere aspira
tions of a plain pioneer people.
But it has outrun the pace of the
State in its growth in popula
tion, wealth, and culture. r It now
numbers at least 275,000 white
people. This says nothing of
over 200,000 negro Baptist, uoth
ing of thousands of children in
Baptisfjamilies, nothing of tens
of thousands of sympathizers
with the Baptist view of Christi
anity. There are almost as many
Baptists in North Carolina als all
other church members put togeth
er. There are in this state sixty
four Baptist district associations,
'over two thousand'and one'un
dred Baptist churches. Still the
movement grows by leaps and
" bounds. At the present rate of
increase by 1950 there will be in
our State at least 600,000 white
Baptists. ' .
Three fourths of the North Car
olina Baptist strength ib in the
country. That puts on Baptist
shoulders the bulk of the obliga
tion for religiousleaderebipinthe'
present, reju venation ot our coun
try districts. It is a serious ques
tion whether they will measure
up to the obligation. The com
monwealth has them under test
at this point
Some think that the only pecu
liarity of Baptists is their mode
' of baptism. But their distinct
iveness runs far deeper than that;
i baptism is only symbolical- But
to them, that is important, just
because it is simply asymbol.
'Right of access to each soul to
God, the absolute equality of all
believers in Christ, the integrity
and sovereignty of each local
church, these are some of their
fundamental distinctions. . - .
. Their faith is the religious un-
'deroinning for .democracy; the
moral foundations of the modem
republic. '
The Baptist reople of North
Carolina have already grown
many great', institutions: The
Biblical Recorder, their weekly
organ, is read by nearly fifty
thousand people during the year.
Their State Board of Missions
handles annually about $150,
000.00. Besides several private
schools controlled by Baptists,
they have three great colleges
Wake Forest, Meredith, Chowan,
aid fourteen secondary schools
The Thomasville Orphanage, the
pet among their enterprises, it-
the largest institution of its class
in North Carolina and easily one
of the iargeet in all the South.
There tare thousauds of Bap
tists in Watauga county; and
Baptist churches dot every town
ship in the county.
The Baptists of Watauga and
adjoining counties will rejoice to
these facts published in their
county paper. The Baptists o
North Carolina count as one o
their most valuable assets the
friendship of (be Democrat, which
is read by hundreds of Baptist
people who do not see the Bibli
cal Recorder. ;

Charlotte Observer.
There have been several nota
ble discussions recently by men
eminent in commerce and finance
on what possible conditions fire
to face American trade at the
close of the war in Europe. Chair.
man Hurley of the Federal Trade
Commission .has delivered an ad
dress in New York on the subject
in which he predicted that "with,
in five years a new Europe will
be competing with us with war
sharpened brains and war-har-dened
muscles," and he SDoke
tearfully of this competition. On
the other hand, Dr. Edward Ew
ing Pratt, chief of the Bureau of
oreigh and Domestic Commerce
of the American Manufacturers'
Association, and who should be
a qualified authority, takes the
view that American manufactur
ers and exporters will be easily
able to hold their own, in the
coming trade struggle. He flouts
the idea that the United States
will be flooded with low-priced
European products. Such an
idea, he says, is based on a worn
out and obsolete theory ot our
National economy. Doctor Pratt
cites actual conditions in war-
torn Europe in support of his
confidence. "It is perhaps a fact
hat stocks of all sorts of goods
in Europe have been exhausted.
le is informed that the shelves
of wholesale and retail houses
are fairly stripped, that machin
ery of obsolete design is being
pressed into service, that make
shifts are resorted to at every
turn. It is a commonly accepted
fact among business men that
there is no catastrophejjso great
to any business as the disruption
of its organization. The men
who have composed the business
organization. The men "who
lave composed the business or
ganizations of European manu
facturing concerns are in the ar
mies. Machinery, rolling stock,
and equipment of all kinds have
been operating without repairs
and without renewals. Every
one of the European Nations is
piling up great funded debts
which will be paid off by taxes-
taxes that will bear heavily on
business and industry for the
next fifty to one .hundred years.
We know that the credit of Eu
ropean Nations has been strain
ed to the breaking point in order
to supply the finances of this Ti
tanic struggle.
Doctor Tract has a poor opin
ion of a protective tariff, a tariff
for revenue or free trade. What
we need, he says, is a bargaining
tariff, one which should enable
us to get the maximum advan
tage of. international trade. It
is a pleasure to note that Doctor
Pratt gives endorsement to the
idea of Congressman Webb, as
writted into his bill to promote
exports. He gives expression to
the opinion thatjone very im
portant step in the development
our foreign trade remains to
be taken, referring to the pass
age of a measure which will per
mit our manufacturers to com
bine for the purpose of develop
ing foreign trade, hiswill put
our manufacturers on a basi
similar to that of the manufac
turers and exporters of other na
tions.
important to the moral, educa
tional, civic life of our whole com

patriotism meet in the Baptist

Mrs. Blair Killed ii Ants Accident
Mrs. Mary Blair 'received inju
ries from which she died four
hours later and several . others
were painfully injured in an au
tomobile wreck near the Conley
place, on the Hickory road, Sun
day afternoon about 4 o'clock.
The other occupants of the auto
mobile were Mrs. J. Gordon Bal
lew, Miss Mattie Mae Ballew,
owner of the car; Miss Fannie
Jones, of Yonkers, N. Y., who is
visiting Miss Ballew, and Fred
erick Dula, the young son of Dr.
and Mrs, A. W. Dula.
The accident happened just this
side of the Conley place at the
creek bridge. There is a mighty
close turn, going from this way,
to get on the bridge. The ap
proach leads down the side of the
hill and turns abruptly at right
angles on' the bridge. This turn
is almost too short for big cars
and when Miss Ballew drove her
car on the bridge Sunday after
noon the left front fender struck
the guard rail on the ' lower side
of the bridge. A quick turn of
the steering wheel, together with
the force of the car striking the
guard rail,' sent the car off the
bridge on the upper side. In the
twelve feet fall that followed All
the occupants but Mrs Blair and
rederick Dula were thrown clear
of the automobile. The Dula boy
fell safely between the seats, but
Mrs. Blair was caught across the
back of one of the seats and was
held thpre for probably twenty
minutes or longer, until help
could be secured to lift the car
and take her out Mrs. Blair was
conscious and remained so until
a few minutes before her death.
Just as soon as Bhe was taken
rom under the car she was
brought here to the house of her
daughter, Mrs. J. Gordon Bal
iew, where everything possible
was done for her by physicians
and surgeons. For several hours
the family and, friends thought
that there were no internal inju
ries. However, after several hours
she lapsed into unconsciousness
and died very shortly.
Mrs. Mary Blair was the wife
of the late Geo. H. Blair, who
lied last February. She was a
u'sterof the late Mrs. J G. Bal-
ew, whose husband served in the
war as a major, olie was tne
mother of Mrs. J. Gordon Ballew,
Jr., and is also survived by two
other children, Mr. J. It. Blair, of
Thomasville, and Mr. Neil Blair,
who lives at the old home place
in Watauga.
The body of Mrs. Blair was ta
ken to Boone yesterday, and to
day it will be placed at rest in the
fa in ily plot in the Boone cemetery.
Both Mrs. Ballew and Miss Bal
lew are prostrated with grief and
friends have been much concerned
about their condition. MissJone
is suffering from a broken or bad
ly sprained arm. The others re
ceived minor bruises and scratch
es only.
Gael Famine in New York
Coincident with the unprece-
iented cost in the price of domes
tic coal to $12.50 a ton here to-
.lay, retail merchants notified the
public that only conservation o
the supply and the limitation o!
deliveries to one ton a customer
would avert a famine.
. rue soaring prices are du, re
tailers aud wholesalers agree, to
the enormous demands of ruanu
facturing plants, which are work
ing either full time, over time or
double time, the shortage of un
skilled labor at the mines, the
freight car shortage, the prema
ture consumption of the reserve
stock and the utilization of dom
estic coal for manufacturing pur.
poses.

she is still in the race.
Ti Erect a Memorial
To the Editor Watauga Democrat.
It has been decided to erect in
Blowing Rock a memorial to Doc
tor Parlier, a memorial which
shall be a lasting and well de
served tribute from his friends
and neighbors who appreciate
his earnest, sympathetic and help-
ul life among them.
It is proposed that this memo
rial shall take the form of a gran
ite bowlder, carrying a bronze
tablet bearing an inscription
which shall, in a few fi tting words,
tell the story of his useful life,
this memorial to be surrounded
by an appropeiate iron railing.
Such a simple vet substantial
monument, it is thought, would
be most typical of the man.
It is hoped that all of his friend
will consider this communication
as an invitation to contribute to
the necessary funds, as those hav
ing the matter in charge are par
ticularly anxious that all who
knew and loved Dr. Parlier may
feel that they have a share in this
tribute of respect and affection,
whatever the size of their contri
bution. No amount in excess of
$5.00 will be accepted from any.
one.
The undersigned, requesting
that all local contributions be
sent to either Mr. E. S. Coffey of
Boone or Mr. George M. Sudderth
of Blowing Rock, will correspond
directly with those summer resi
dents who cherish in constant
oving memory the pleasure and
benefit which came to them thru
their association with the good
man.

"Pastor" Russell Dead -
Charles Taze Russell, known as
Pastor" Russell. an independent
ininiHter.editorof the Watch tow
er and prominent author of stud
ies on the Scriptures, died on an
Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe
train en route from Los Angeles
to New York ou the 31st. Heart
disease was given as the cause.
Pastor Russell was president of
the International BibleStudente'
Association of London and the
Watch Tower Bible and Tract
Society of Pennsylvania, and an
author of studies of the Scrip
tures. He was born in Pittsburg
Pa , February 10, 1852.
Mr. Russell, who was en route
from Los Angeles to New Y6rk,

leaving Los Angeles, his secretary
said, and his condition gradually
grew worse until death came.

Virginia Now oa Dry List
At the stroke of 12 on the night
of October 31st every church bell
in Richmond tolled for 10 min
utes, whistles and sirens shrieked
aud the few remaining Baloons
closed their doors for the last
time. The passing ot the legal
ized liquor business was variously
celebrated. While thousands of
people, many garbed in Hallow
'en costumes, paraded the streets
and other thousands struggled
or their turns for the final drink
at the bars, the churches held ser
vices of prayer and jubilation.
Clubs and fashionable hotels held
'open house" and in some caes
what liquor remained was dis
pensed free of cost. While the
night was a wild and boisterous
one on the streets, there was no
serious disorder and the extra
policemen stationed in thd saloon
and retail districts had little to
do. Half of the saloons had dis
posed of their liquor by nightfall
and from that hour on until mid
night they at once locked their
doors and when the final minute
came few had any stocks remain
ing.
The last day of the "wet" re
gime was marked by heavy sales
to citizens. It is estimated by
iquor dealers that local buyers
iave expended not less than $2,.
000,000 in stocking up their eel-
ars. Buying of similar propor
tions is reported from all sections
of the state.
