^ OF ITS LEADER-LATEST INDICATIONS

New York, November 7:?Jus
before midnight the election returns
still incomplete in: iany States, in
dicated the electiol of Hughes an<
Fairbanks, but the A ures were ver;
close and the DemoV atic manager
steadfastly refused to concede a Re
publican victory.
Though the metropolitan newspa
pers that have supported Presiden
Wilson conceded his defeat,the Dem
ocratic managers insisted that com
plete returns from the West wou!<
reverse the trend which seemed to b
steadily piling up in the Hughes col
umn.

At 11:30 o'clock tonight Vance C

national committee, gave out

"We have received nothing from

Mr McCormick added that he
ould not give out a definite statelent
before tomorrow morning unss
later reports indicated a decided
range in the political situation.
The returns from Ohio are insufcient
to determine the result in
iat State.
All of the New England States and
ew Jersey as well as Wisconsin and
ichigan have been removed from
le list of doubtful States.
?
Unless there is a landslide for Present
Wilson on the Pacific slope the
ection of Hughes seems certain.
Although President Wilson's secreiry
at the summer White House,and
hairman McCormick, of the Dem
iratic national committee, made
aims that the complete returns
ould show the re election of Presi?nt
Wilson, the trend on the face
f the returns was toward Hughes
id early in the evening some of the
ew York newspapers, which have
ipported President Wilson, conded
his defeat, although they made
) statement in figures.
A great majority for Hughes in
ew York was evident early and the

Soon afterward Democratic
supporters conceded the loss of all
New England, and the incoming ret
turns from the Middle West, al;
'
though far from complete, showed
the Hughes figures growing fast.
An early estimate of the Hughes
electoral vote without Ohio placed it

for a majority in the Electoral College.
The Hughes majorities reported
from Indiana and Illinois were regarded
by the Republican leaders as
: an indication of what might be expected.
| New York, November 8:?Shortly
after midnight such returns as were
complete or so far complete as to be
I regarded as indicative gave Presi-1
dent Wilson 232 votes in the Electo- j
ral College; Hughes 239 and left 60
votes doubtful in eight States. It
requires 266 votes to elect a Presi- j
dent. j
