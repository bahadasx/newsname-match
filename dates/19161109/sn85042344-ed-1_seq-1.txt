CAUFORNIA AND MINNESOTA SWINGING BACK INTO G. 9. P. COLUMN
BOTH PARTIES CLAIM
VICTORY WITH RESULT
STILL VERY DOUBTFUL
f ,
XKW YORK, Nov. 8 At' midnight returns such as
were complete or so far complete as.to be .regarded as in
dicative gave President Wilson 232 votes in the electoral
college; Hughes 239 and left sixty votes doubtful in eight
'Mate. It requires 200 votes to elect a president.
Although California still showed a lead for the presii
dent and his campaign managers were elaiming-it by at
bast l,r00, the president's majority there had dwindled
to a little more than 1,400 with about one-fifth of the dis
tricts missing.
In Minnesota, too, the Wilson lead which was as high
r,s ten thousand early, in the day steadily decreased as
the vote from the rural districts came in. During the
evening Hughes took the lead with a small margin and
then the president shot ahead again, but with less than a
thousand votes. The Republican managers claimed the
state on the final returns.
NKNV YOl IK, Nov. 8. Vigils were kept by anxious
watchers tonieht at headquarters of both the Dem-
fwcnii,. mftl l?prnhlic!in national committees. Bulletins

Chairman Vance McCormick for the Democrats and
"William H. Willcox for the Republicans professed con
fidence in the outcome. The former was somewhat more
explicit, in his claims, but the latter declared after dining
with Charles ft. Hughes that he agreed with them that
the Republicans had been successful.
"We ask only what is fair," Mr. Willcox said. "We
want onlv what, we are entitled to and that we mean to
have."
Guarding Ballots.
Earlier in the day Mn McCormick had announced that
he had sent telegrams to state and county chairmen in
.doubtful states directing them to keep careful guard
over the ballot boxes and their contents.
Attoiney-Oeneral Oregon- visited Democratic, head
quarters and was closeted with the chairman, but it was
asserted bis visit was of no spcc'al significance. Later
in the afternoon Mr. McCormick conferred with John 11.
Stanch field and Delaney Nicoll, prominent Democratic
law vers...
Mr. McCormick refused to, comment
on the significance of their visit or
the possibility of demanding a recount
in states where the result is ery olos-v
"It is too parly for that," he mild.
"Of course, if we go Into that kind of
thing v.e shall want the best lawyers
we can get."
The I lemocratic chairman announced
that I'nited States marshals were
watching to see that there were in,
violations of tho law In states where j
the result Is close. Mr. McCormick,
expressed the belief that the votes of
Mate soldiers now on duty In the Mex
