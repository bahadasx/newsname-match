Gentlemen :
We your Finance committee beg to

We find the Parish Treasurer out of
balance $1.00 which is in the account
of Bridge Fund of Ward 9, he has been
advised and will correct this as soon as
he has time to check this account.
We find 10 Vouchers which were hon
ored by the Banks or Parish Treasurer
with endorsement by Mr. R. P. Quarles
for the parties that the Vouchers were
made payable to which were drawn on
Road Tax Ward 2.
We find H Vouchers which were
treated in a like manner from Road
District No. 3. Ward 10,which were en
dorsed by Mr. J. H Russell.
We do not question these two lots of
Vouchers, but this is very loose and
bad practice, and we recommend that
our Vouchers be endorsed by the party
to whom the Voucher is made, and
treated by the Banks and Treasurer
under the regular Banking ruling of
