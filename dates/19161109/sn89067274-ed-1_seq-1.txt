GEORGE MARSHALL, one of
Mexico's brightest and most reliable

important business department of the

newspaper work, especially the bus

paper Homer Bassford, formerly of
the Mexico Ledger, is general man
ager) is making a splendid record and
without any question is not only go

on up to the top. Young Marshall
has the ,-Tight kind of qualifications

STATE TICKET SEEMS LOST
Missouri Seems to Have Gone Repub
lican, Although Reed Has Won
His Race.
Wood row Wilson was re - elected
President of the United States.
Champ Clark, James A. Reed
were again returned to Washington.
Wilson has safely 256 electoral
votes and Hughes, 238.
ST. LOUIS, Nov. 8. With the ex
ception of Reed, it looks very much
as though the entire Democratic state
ticket had lost in Missouri. Unless
Gardner can keep Lamm's majority
in this city below 12,000, he cannot
win. Gordon lost St Louis by 27,000
votes, and Gardner by at least 10,000.
The results on the amendments are
coming in slowly though the prohi
bition amendment is said to have been
lost.

NEW SANTA FE DEPOT
AND SHOPS.
THE tentative survey for the Santa
Fe extension from Carrolllon to Mex
ico is just north of the city limits.
We are in hopes that when the road
i, built the depot will be more con-
vtnient to our people than to have
II outside the city limits. The Santa
ft extension will materially assist In
nking Mexico a city, and our people
pwally are interested in the loca
te of the new station. We believe
it would be a good idea for the Com
mercial Club to take this matter up
Kith the proper officials ind see
what can be accomplished. There
seems to be no question but that the
extension will be built, and probably
this year. Anyway the Commercial
Club should at once get busy regard,

FEN NEW ALU STEERS $11.25.
George Fennewald, startled cattle
men again today when he turned up
with another string of his prime
beeves. This Audain county, Mo.,
feeder has been shooting all around
the record price during the past few
weeks. Today he sold steers at $11.25
the second highest price paid on this
market for beeves.
In his consignment there were
three loads of cattle, 57 head of
which averaged 1438 pounds and sold
to Morris & Co. at the above mention
ed price to fill an eastern order. Mr.
Fennewald had other steers at $10.75
today.
"I bought these steers on the St.
Louis market seven months ago. I
started right away to feeding hay,
corn and cottonseed meal. They made
big gains and sold about as well as I
expected them to."
"The cattle were purebred Angus
steers. Mr. Fennewald has been mak
ing the beef for years. There are few
in the country who have anything on
this cattle fattener when it comes to
sold steers at $11.15, that were the
top of the market for their weight.
He has been putting a top on the St.
Louis market nearly every time he
comes in the past few years.

Takes Animal on Twenty-five Mile

USES A FORD CAR
Had Bought Pony from James Dowell
in Thia City, Wednesday Morn
ing Animal Seemed Pleased.
The days of wonders never cease.
If you would sea a horse riding in
the back seat of an automobile you
would pinch yourself and look again.
That is what many Mexico citizens
did Wednesday afternoon when they
saw J. L. Dunn, of Callaway County,
drive out of this city in his Ford
car. On the rear scat was a large
negro and standing in front of him
and held firmly in his grasp, was a
Shetland pony. '
The pony had been bought by Mr.
Dunn from James Dowell. He did
not want to ship Jt to his home in
Callaway county ana it was impos
sible to lead it behind the. car, so
the animal was loaded into the ma
chine and enjoyed a 12-mile trip over
land. This is no doubt the first time
in the history of the motor car in
this section of Missouri, if not in the
West, where a pony rode 25 miles in
the back seat of a Ford touring car.

last Sunday, November 5th, at the
home of P. H. Ecton, five miles west
of this city, in honor of J. V., and
F. A. Beatty and Mrs. Nannie Creasey
of Blackwcll, Oklahoma. Over nine
ty relatives and friends of these good
people gathered together, coming in
at about ten-thirty with well-filled
baskets to enjoy the occasion, and no
doubt the last, for a number of those
who were present. All in ail, it was
a great Sunday, one of the most pleas
and affairs ever held in that locality,
and all present will long bless the
day of the occasion. Much credit is
due to Mr. Isaac Jesse, who planned
the occasion. The writer has spent
many pleasant days in tho locality,
but none more pleasant than this.

CANDIDATES
CALLS IT "GREAT WET WAY"
NEW YORK, Nov. 7 "The Great
Wet Way" is the name applied to
Broadway and other saloon - filled
streets by a minister in this city.
"If the saloons of this city were plac
ed end to end they would make the
longest street in the world," the pas
torsaid. "Dives are wide open. There
are more than 1,400 churches in this
city, one for each 3,500 of the popula
tion, but there is a saloon for every
350 people."
His words have started a contro
versy with the liquor people on one
side and the Prohibitionists on the
other. The ratio of population to
churches and saloons is used by each
side in the arguments to down the op
position. Figures never lie, but they
can be twisted.
(Fulton News)
Fred Black, one of Fulton's popu
lar traveling salesmen, was severely
hurt in an automobile accident, six
miles from Mexico, Sunday evening,

atives in Moberly and reaching Mex
ico in the afternoon, with no trains

Credie The last named stopped
their car to permit the Mexico ma
chine to go by but the chaffeur, evi-
dentlv blinded by the lights, failed to
see a large rut in the road and when
he struck it his car was overturned
Mr. Black was thrown against the
door of the car but Mr. Nickell man-
ged to protcet himself by holding
to the left side of the car.
Mr. and Mrs. Maddox took Mr.
Black to Mexico, where he was treat
ed by a physician,' who pronounced
is injuries severe but not serious.

Time is worth money, but the farm
er who is willing to jog along ten hours
over a bad road when a concrete road
a road with the maintenance built
in it will bring him to the same point
in less time and with greater ease, is
somewhat like the negro who
feeding corn in the shuck to his hog
when an "efficiency engineer" drove
up.
"Mose, do you know that if you
shucked that corn, shelled it and then
boiled it a little, your hog could eat
it in a whole lot less time?"
Maybe so," asid Mose, with
spreading smile,"kin ye tell me how
much time is wuth to a hog .'
Nothing to the hog, of course, but
isn't it worth something to you to get
it to market sooner?"
The smile of doubt spread into one
of discernment Mose saw.
The man who learns that he can
turn time wasted on a bad road into
cash in bank by marketing his pro
ducts over a concrete road, is the farm
er whose viewpoint has been corrected
by experience and observation.
CORNMEAL IS A FOOD HOPE,
DF.S MOINES. Ia Nov. 7 And
now its corn meal which is being re
commended by the state food and dairy
commission as highly desirable food
because it is comparatively low
price and high in food value. Corn
bread, corn meal mush, a mixture of
half corn meal and half flour for bread
baking, hominy and a breakfast food
made of corn arc cited as foods which
are comparatively cheap.
A pound of corn meal can be bought
for three cents, the department say3,
In food value it contains as much of
the food nutriments as 19.2 cents
worth of milk, 24 cents worth of cheese
64 cents worth of eggs, 41.5 cents
worth of round steak- and ten cents'
worth of bread.

NEW YORK, Nov. 7 Nearly lti
billion dollars in gold is still tucked,
away in the French peasant's woolen
sock bank today, despite the hundreds
of millions he has poured out of it to
help his goverpment win the war.
Maurice Trembley tola it prouaiy.
Just arrived in America as the rep
resentative of a group of French
bankers to help the French merchants
buy American supplies, the big, smil
ing Frenchman revelea in me story
of how the poor French folks rainy
day fund has fought a big share of
the war and is still big enough to
give the French a flying start in busi
ness when peace comes.
Gold in every home.
"No matter how humble the home,"
said Trembley, "you may know, al
though you could not find it in a day's
search, that somewhere in it a woolen
sock containing gold is buriea. it
is the French peasant's pride, that
sock.
"The remaining 2 billion francs
gold will stay buried unless the worst
comes to the worst. If the old men
and women believed it was needed to
win the war they would dig it up in
a minute.
"Just before I sailed I saw a need
lessly worried old French peasant and
his wife, very poorly' clad and none too
well cared for in any respect, bring
what remained of their meager gold
kavitiM to the bank. It wlas not
taken, for it was not needed, but it is
available to the government at any
time.
'Already in this very poor and aged
couple's home is a government receipt
for several hundred francs gold, mat
is all they get for their money, a gov
ernment receipt. The peasants nevjr
try to collect on these receipts. They
take them home and trame iiem.
roughly and hang them on tho wall.
Sock Band Will Revive country.
"It is the woolen sock bank that is
going to put France on its feet, so
quickly after the war. Every penny
of French indebtedness will be paid
strictly according to contract, both in
France and in America. And you
will be amazed at the rapidity with
which the French people will square
aWav in business then.
"No matter how severe the drain ot
war is on the individual Frenchman's
purse, he is saving a little, no matter
how little that little may be, for the
sunshiny day that will follow the pres
ent rainy ones."
LONDON, Nov. 4. One of the
greatest British banks, the London
City and Midland, has appointed a wo
man to a branch management. The
branch is in a remote country dis
trict, but the bank is credited with the
intention of going further in the mat
ter, and apparently thirty or forty
women are being trained in readiness
to take up positions.
An exceptionally large percentage
of the employees of the institution
have joined the colors, and the short
age of men is likely to be even more
serious in the new year, when the
exemption period of many of the re
maining members of the statr ex-
nires.
"I do not like the idea," said an oi-
ficial of the bank, "but it may be nec
cessary to extend the sphere of use
fulness in connection with of staff
of women, who have done, and are
doing, excellent work. Nothing is
settled at present, but we may find it
expedient, in view of tho shortage of
men, to put women in control of some
of our country branches.
I appreciate," he added, the dif
ficulty of getting men to serve under
the control of women, and as a so
lution of that awkward problem we
should see to it that in these branch
es the staff would be all women."

FAMOUS YIDDISH POET DEAD,
NEWYORK, Nov. 4. Leading
Jews in New York have just received
word of the death in Odessa, Russia,
of Simon Samuel Frug, noted for his
poetry in Yiddish. Mr. Frug was
widely known also as a writer in Rus
sian. He was born in Russia, and

when 16 years old was taken up as a
student by a famous Russian writer,
who taught him the technique of his
art. Mr. Frug began writing in Rus
sian, but later took the use of Yid
dish to convey his thoughts to his own
people. At the time of the program
in Odessa and Kishineff he wrote a
poem calling upon the Jewish people
to send money for bread for the liv
ing and shrouds for the dead.
Jews of the East Side are pre
paring a great memorial in honor of
Frug.
TORONTO, Can., Nov. 4 One of
tre very apparent changes which the
was has caused in Canada within
the last ten months may be seen at
any time in Toronto through the wind
ows of any demonstration uptown
banking office. Women have taken
their places behind many desks which
less than a year ago were attended by
All the banks of Canada are re
cruiting their staffs, both at the head
office and throughout the entire
system of branches, from the coun
try's feminine population, ine
has taken from the banks a very large
proportion of their men employees,
and the breach in the ranics or dusi-
ness is being filled largely by girls,
When the war was declared the
number of men of military age em
ployed in the banks of Canada was
14,341. At the beginning of April,
1916, almost 36 of that number had
enlisted. The draft upon the staffs
of the banks was particularly heavy
during the first three months of this
vear. and led to the general employ
ment in clerical positions of qualified
young women. It was estimated by
bank inspector that at least a.ouu
women clerks are now at work in
banking offices from one end of Can
ada to the other. That means that at
least one quarter of the present num-
ber of clerical positions in the banks
of Canada are filled by women.
Are they there to stay? Do they
want to stay? Those are the ques
tions which only the experience of
another year of two will answer defi
nitely. So far, on the whole, the work of
ti.ese women clerks appears to have
been .very efficient. Their positions
range all the way from the simple
task of junior service to the keeping
of ledgers' and the handling of cash
in the teller's cage. In one big down
town bank the ledgers of the entire
savings department are bein handl-
by women, and they are doing
their work well.
WANTS FATHER AT WEDDING
NEW YORK, Nov. 4. Wishing to

Powell, 22 years old, of Westport,
Conn,, appealed to the police to aid

Young Powell is engaged to marry
Miss Ella Modine, of Westport. He

set, so that the search for Powell's
father can be completed.

WORLD NO WORSE
MILWAUKEE, Nov. 6. "We
don't believe that the world is growing
worse and going to tho devil, even
though the attire of our women as
they walk the streets does suggest
that Satan rules," declared Bishop
Charles B. Mitchell at the annual Mil
waukee District Conference.
"There is a difference between the
gown of beauty and that which is a
lure to sin. Abbreviated skirts, low
necks, transparent filmy frocks may
be beautiful from the artistic stand
point, but they are abhorcnt to the
man of God, who sees that the de
signers who devised the styles are
patently playing to human passion.
'It is a pity that the costumer can
so pervert a beautiful design of a
frock into one which hints only at
evil."
