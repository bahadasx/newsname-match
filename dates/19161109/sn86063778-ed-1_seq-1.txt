Richmond District Farmers Are in

Washington.?The Federal Reserve
Hoard's business summary jus*, an- <
ncunced that general conditions in all
the 12 Federal reserve districts of the
county were satisfactory with extraordinary
activity in nearly all lines.
Labor shortage was reported by nearly
all the district agents, and most of
them referred to the increasing cost
of living.
The report from the Richmond district
says farmers are In better position
financially than ever before as
the result of good crops and high
prices. There seems to be a steady
ingress of homeseekers and a large
acreage of virgin soil is being cleared.
The cotton crop in that district is
generally reported short, the best sections
estimating a yield of but 50 to
60 per cent, but the current price of
from 16 to 18 cents a pound makes
each bale worth more than $100. including
the seed. In a few counties
in South Carolina only 20 to 20 per
cent crop is reported, hcwever, and
small planters there will barely be
able to pay this year's bills.
1 In reference to the cost of living
in Richmond the report says:
"High prices of crops bring many
' comments as to the high cost of living
and expressions of serious doubt
1 as to how labor is to support itself,
notwithstanding high wages."

1 Americans from Chihuahua City. The
report, also received by United States
Government agents and forwarded to
Washington, said the Villa forces
have taken possession of the city.
There has been 110 confirmation from
Mexican sources of the message.
American mining men who have in- 1
terests in Parral are concerned over
1 the fate of nine Americans known to
' be in the city. This anxiety was in'
creased by the news from Chihuahua
' City that the bandits who held up the
' Mexican Central passenger train at |
Laguna station assaulted I)r. Steven
Haffner, a German subject, because
' they thought he was an American.

The Dcutschland is in this port after

It was possible, the navigator

In a summary of his voyage, just
completed. Captain Keonig, who returned
with decorations from German
royalty as marks of recognition
for his pioneer voyage, said this was
"a quiet trip." Recital of its incidents,
however, developed matters of
lively interest. The Deutschland did !
not lie on the ocean floor this time,
as in the voyage which ended at
Baltimore last July. The submarine
instead varied the monotony of its
sailing under water or on tho surface
with occasional dodges beneath
vessels identified as warships of belligerent
nationality or thought to be.
Seven times. Captain Koenig said, he
maneuvered in this way. Tho last
time was off Nantucket when he
sighied a "four-funneled steamer"
and dived beneath her.
"The storms gave us more trouble
than this so-called blockade," he continued.
"We were beset by heavysouthwest
gales for days, and they
were with us most of the way across.

During the trip of 4.500 miles the

Captain Koenig said.
"They call it blockade. You can
judge how much it blocks," the skipper
exclaimed.

by a German submarine, with
loss of American lives, that the incident
threatens to fall Into a technical
discussion rather than a clean-cut issue
of whether Germany has violated
her pledges to the United States.
It became apparent that much
which is essential to a determination
of the responsibility remains undisclosed,
if indeed the United States,
Germany <*r Great Britain are in
possession of the full facts.
It appeared certain, however, that
no move will be made by the United

In the mill villages of South Carolina
98 night schools with an enrollment
of over 5.000 pupils.
"The teachers have said that they
enjoyed teaching adults more than
any work they have ever done. The
pupils have profited immensely. Will
you, through your night school work,
help to lift from our state the blight
of ignorance? The best way to work
up the night school is by personal
visiting and special invitation. The
illiterate wants to learn but has to be
persuaded that he can learn.
"When the exact night is set for the
opening the announcement should be
made in the churches, in the mill,
and elsewhere. The mill authorities
are always glad to furnish house,
light and fuel for the night school
and often to pay something on the
teacher's salary.
"A session of at least six or eight
weeks should be held before Christmas.
while the nights are long and
the weather usually better than later
in the winter. Then too. the teacher
should have the Christmas holiday

You can not realize what is means to
a grown man, after a hard day's work,
for you to open your school promptly,
work steadily for an hour and n
half, or two hours, two or three
times a week.
"When instructing the class, if you
visit each man at his work and help
him to figure his pay warrant, and
read his paper and to spell his infrequent
home letter, you have solved
your problem.
