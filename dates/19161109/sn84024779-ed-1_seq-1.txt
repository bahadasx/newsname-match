It was nip and tuck in North Da

scattered over the state heard from
up to 0 o'clock Wednesday morning
the president received 28,974, to Hughe*
28,740.
Burke failed to show the strength
which the head of the nation dis
played at the polls Tuesday. rkut
tered returns from 788 precincts givt
him 15,670 MeCumber, his republicar
opponent, 26,225 votes. It is believed
that from the returns so far in Me

played relatively the same strength
that he did in the June primaries. Thai

the Nonpartisan league slogan, "Wei1
Stick," was lived up to by the mem
bers of the league, was evidenced as
the returns came in from over the
state. D. H. McArthur, the demo
cratic candidate, made a good showing
despite the handicaps under which he
conducted his campaign.
The Nonpartisan league candidates
for the supreme court won out with
handsome majorities. As was expect
ed P. Casey, the democratic candidate
for state treasurer who had been en
dorsed by the Nonpartisan league, de
feated John Steen, the present incum
bant and republican candidate. In
complete returns on the legislative
ticket indicate that the candidates en
dorsed by the Nonpatrisan league won
out all down the line.
For governor, 262 precincts over the
state give Frazier 10,370 McArthui
4,146.
The supreme court total in 39 of 98
precincta in Cass and Trail counties,
gave Fisk 2,097, Spaulding 2,396, Bird
zell 1,645, Robinson 1,911, Grace 1,496,
Burke 1,943.

LETTER PROM MELVIN EARLY
Mercedes, Texas,
Oct. 20th, 19iti
[Dear Friend:
I just look a trip to Brownes
ville and Point Isabelle. I tliol
as long as we were down here,- I
might "as well see it all. Bravwn
esville is about forty miles from
here and Point Isabelle is on the
Gulf. We went to Brownsville,
and from there we took a car
the Point, because there are not
Very many railroads running thru
here. The road that, we came
down on is about the only one in
this part of the country. So we
stood out in a car but could only
get about half way. because we
.struck to much wind so we missed
'.the best part of that trip.
I am sending you some of the
pictures of a few scenes around
here. One is of the pumping
station that Linn talks about in
the Globe-Gazette. It is surround
on all sides by weeds and bushes.
We are being timed on our
inarching hikes which we are sup
posed to make four miles in an
hour but we made it in fifty min
utes. On one of our many hikes
we visited the International
Bridge, which is being guarded by
the soldiers. There area couple
of machine guns in the center and
many sacks of sand uaed on the
bridge for breastworks so the
greasers can not cross.
Lieut. Dommick is detailed from
this regiment to the 35th Infantry
U. S. and is in charge of the
Bridge.
Well of all the surprising things
there are here, is the article that
surprised me the most was to see
,the street cars being pulled by
mules.
OKLAHOMA CITY, Okla., Nov. 8.—
Meager returns from several Oklah-.ma

John Archibald, a young man who

hobby. He maintains that lie
could take any girl from the*
streets or a factory worker and
with a years proper schooling and
training make a lady out of her,
one who would be received in the
highest society on Fifth Avenue,
with the proper sponsor. He ac
cidently drops a flower pot out of
his balcony windw and strikes a
young girl on the head. She is
knocked insensible, his bachelor
friends carry her into his apart
ment where he revives her. Ho
states the proposition to her a id
she accepts, because she has al
ways had a longing to be "like
other people." Jn a year sin?
makes her debut in one of the'
leaders homes on secluded socie
ties battle ground. She makes
good and incidentally wins the
heart of one of tht societv youn"
men. Her sponsor, John Archi
bald, is also in love with her, btii
.realizes it too late. This is the
starting of an miusuallv clever
paly, and the comedy is extremely
well written. Heautiful costumes
