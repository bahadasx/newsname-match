VERDICT OF METHODIST
EPISCOPAL CHURCH 1
3
In the recent General Conference 1
of the Methodist Episcopal Church
the following resolulon was adopted:
"The liquor traffic Is the one most c
prolific cause of insanity, crime and 1
l>overty, the most lusldlous despoiler x
of legitimate business; the most corrupt
and demoralizing influence In *>
politics, aud the most dangerous en- *
euiy to human welfare In all our civic.?'
life. | h
"Statesmanship ecclesiastical and t
civil, lias denounced it, science has o
condetned It; business is arraying it- 1
self against it; politics is struggling p
to be freed from its grasp; labor p
neeks escape froui Its degrading, mer- i
clless l>ondage, and the embattled ^
nations of half a world find It a more 8
deadly foe than any they have met t
on war's red fields. I
"The expansion of religion and the
preservation of civilization require ^
its overthrow?its complete and utter
annihilation.. J
"The whole license system Is a 8
colossal blunder, wrong in principle, ^
lame in logic, a failure in practice, a &
fool's bargain, a sale of souls for
gold. It is contrary to the teachings ?
and the spirit of the Christian relig- ii
ion and at variance with all the pur- h
I?oses of enlighened government. It
clothes the traffic with the cloak of g
resnectahilltv and lirlhwi fhn vntor i.
with revenue. r
"We hold now, as In the past, that ^
such a traffic cannot l>e legalized without
Sill.
The time has come when the line y
should be definitely and sharply 0
drawn between the supporters and ti
partners of this traffic and those who r<
stand for its abolition. A man can- j
not, as a Christian citizen, sign a n
petition for a liquor license, rent ii
property to be used for the purposees w
of the tnffic, vote for it or with it, h
or fall txttgnake his citizenship count fc

In Short and Simple Ceremony von r
Beseler Reads Emperor's v
Manifesto.
Warsaw, Sunday, Nov. 5(via Ber- 1
lln, Nov. 0.?The manifesto of Em- s
peror William and Emjteror Francis 1
Joseph, again calling Into existence n
the ancient kingdom of Poland, was e
read at noon today to the assembled v
Polish representatives in the ropal p
(untile uy viuvcniur vjtrntriui vuil neselor.
Outside, in the great square before
the castle and in the spacious courtyard
of he venerable 14th century pile,
inhabitants of the old Polish capital
gathered by the thousands to attend ^
the ceremony of what is designated as
the rebirth of the Polish nation.
Quickest to realize the significance a
of the day were the academic youth, n
students of the University of Warsaw, a
the polytechnic school and other high- ?
er Institutions of learning, who attend- 8
ed the ceremony In corporate units
bearing banners and wearing the gay
student ribbons.
This afternoon they are leading parades
and demonstrations through
streets bright with red flags. They
are volunteers by the hundreds for the
Polish army which, the manifesto announced,
will l>e called into existence.
The ceremony was short and simple
At noon fieneral von Beseler, wearing
the decorations granted for the reduction
of Antwery and Polish fortresses,
mounted the dais in the gala ballroom
of tlie old Jugellonian castle and, in
the name of Oermauy's sovereign,
read the imperial manifesto. When he
ceased the Polish Count Hutton-Czapski,
the palace commandant, read from
a leather-bund pamphlet to the Polish
notables a translation of the manifesto
8
hi their own language. t
Then came cheers from the hitherto
silent crowd; cheer* for Poland, f

Mr. L. E. Gardner In wilting to the
leffersonian gives the following intersting
account of gold mining projects
tear Jefferson: 1
Ths gold uilue was discovered by
Jurwell Brewer, nearly one hundred
ears ago. Mr. Brewer, and his assls- I
nuts got their gold by using log rock_s
aiul sluice boxes, but in later years
l northern coinpauy got in posesslon
if the mine und made their gold by f
he hydraul ic process. They were t
ery successful, so much so, that they t
lecided to work the mine on a larger 2
cale. In 1889 the company built a v
0 stamp mill down to the foot of the f
y on top of the hill and blasted out a
>111, on Fork Creek and opened a qua- ,J
be ore and It was conveyed to the mill ^
n a train of cars through a tunnel
300 feet long. The stamp mill was a
>ut lu operation April 1890. The out- ^
ut of gold for the first mouth, was ?
51bs. The mill dldu't run many yearn *
efore the hard ooundci! ore and pois
ouuos gases and chemicals used at T
lie mill begau to dniaage furm lauds
long the creek l?eYw the mine. f
The laudowuers sued the company e
or damages and the mill wwus shut
own. The mine has not been worked 1;
luce except on a small sca:,o, 'the tl
Northern compuny sold the mine tract 11

sw years ago. Mr. Clyburn Is the pre- 1

h
I believe this Is one of the richest t]
old miens n South Carolina. All that 0
? needed Is money, necessary machines',
and plenty of will power to make y
lie Clyburn mine a paying proposition. ,j
I am not an expert at gold mintig. e

f Yoj Want to Rave Money, Read a
This. v
In an article in "The Family Money" j,
epartment of the Noveml?er American p
iagazine a writer says: v
"When an old uncle of mine died
nil left me a little bequest of $545, e
ly first impulse was to 'even it off,' t
nd if it hadn't been for an old friend ?
f my father's I think I would have p
uceeeded in neatly paring it down to a
ero. t
"What were you thinking of do- t
iig with that money?' he asked casualy
one day. F
"Well," I replied. 'I think I'll just I
ake that $45 and go for a little lake t
rip, and then I'll have $500 to put In c
he bank.' 1
"Why $500?" he said. Why not 1
545? 1
"Oh, I replied, 'you might as well '
lave an even amount.'
"Do you suppose you could spare
ne five dollars?' he asked suddenly.
"Why, yes,' I replied, a little sur- 1
irised that he should ask to borrow *
noney of me; but I handed it to him. *
"All right, then,' he said; 'here's 1
Ive dollars'?handing me back that *
auie bill. 'If you'll just put this with *
hat $545 you'll have $550. and that's
i nice even amount. Now, ir you'll put '
hat in the bank, In three months It *
vlll have earned flve-flfty more, and
mrely in the meantime yon can scrape
ogether $44.50, and then you'll have 1
in even $000 Instead of $500.' *
"Well, what could I do with $000?" 1
[ asked, not very much imi>essed, as '
he difference didn't seem worth the
rouble. 1
"One thing you could do,' replied 3
he old gentleman, 'would be to ask \
our banker to buy a thousand-dollar 1
>ond for you or, rather to lend you 1
he extra $400, keeping the bond as ae- 1

"Then with a pencil and paper he ;

WTRLD AND POSSE FIGHT?.
National Guardsmen Ordered to Assist

Offenders.
Everett, Wash., %ov. 5.?At least
ive men were killed and forty others
were wounded today in a fight
it the Everett city wharf between
!50 members of -the Industrial
vorkers of the World, who came here
rom Seattle on the steamer Verona,
,nd a possee of ICO citizens headed
y Sheriff Don McRae. Sheriff Mo
tae is among the seriously wounded.
The exact number of casualties
board the Verona is not known here.
Lfter the shooting, in which abont
ne thousand shots were exchanged,
he Verona turned around and startd
back to Seattle. Many men were
een to fall on the deck of the Ve fin
II n ml nltoru rinnln
am pod overboard. Some were taken
roin the water, but otehrss disappeard
and it is believed were drowned.
The Verona reached Everett shorty
before 2 o'lock*. The coming of
he party of invaders had been anounced
in messages sent to Everett
rom Seattle headquarters. A call to
ndustrial Workers of the World
lembers from all over the state had
een issued earlier iu th wek and
lie citizens of Everett, at a meeting
eld Saturday uight, plained o meet
lie invaders and deny them privilege
f landing.
When the Verona docked SlierifT
Icltae. who was backed by a posse of
eputy sheriffs and citizens, informd
the men on the boat that they
ould not be iiermited o land. One
f he men, evidently spokesman for
tie party, began arguing with the
lieriff and then made a speech.
Apparently as a signal, the man
ropped his hand and armed men on

started back toward settle.
The trouble between the Industrial
Vorkers of the World and the auhorltiies
at Everett has been on sevral
months and was the outgrowth
if a strike of shingle weavers here.
Lfter several minor outbreaks of
iolence during the strike, Sheriff
fcRne nrtmnizpd a plMwna' mmmlf
ee and expelled all members of the
ndustrial Workers of the World
'rom Everett. On several occasions
mall parties of men have attempted
o enter Everett, but have been turnd
back by the sheriff. Last Monday
orty-five members of the Industrial
Workers of the World came from Settle
hy steamer but were met at the
vharf by the citizens possee, loaded
nto automobiles and escorted to a
oint South of the town, where hey
rere liberated and ordered to leave.
Last week the "Industrial Workrs,"
the official organ of the Indusrial
Workers of the World, in Settle,
announced that the forcible exmlsion
of men from Everett must be
venged and called for 2.000 voluneers
to go to Everett to establish
he "right of free speech."
"The fight must be won," said the
aper, "as the whole future of the
