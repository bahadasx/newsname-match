WILSON, CONFIDENT OF VICTORY,
TAKES AUTO RIDE AND PLAYS GOLF
LONG BRANCH, N. J„ Nov. 8.—
Confident that he had been re-elected,
President Wilson watched returns
from Minnesota .California, New Mex
ico, Oregon and New Hampshire
closely tonight because of assurances
from his cumpaigu managers that the
final outcome depended on those
states Following an automoile ride ,
and golf game efore luncheon, the
president remained in his study at
Shadow Lawn this afternoon and to
night, getting the returns by tele
phone from Secretary Tumulty, who
had been on guard at the executive
offices since 6 o'clock last night.
During his ride the president passed
At Midnight, Estimates Based on the Returns at That Hour Placed California,
Idaho, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Mexico and Washington in the Doubtful
Column With Wilson Leading; Later, Nebraska and North Dakota
Were Added to the Wilson Column, Making His Total 245 Votes.
NEW YORK, Nov. 9.—On the second day after the American people cast their presidential ballots the result still is in doubt and the contest between President Wilson and
Charles E. Hughes has narrowed down to a point whore it may be decided by a few western states. It is within t le range of possibilities that the votes of national guardsmen
on border duty might turn some of the doubtful states from one column to another. Based on actual returns received by the Associated Press, the electoral college now gives
Hughes 239 votes; Wilson 240 and leaves 47 doubtful. Two of the metropolitan newspapers which supported Mr. Hughes give him 252 votes; President Wilson 25 1, and ad
mit the doubtful character of only California, New Mexico and Minnesota. Another which supported the president agrees with is contemporaries in giving him 25 1 votes, but
concedes Mr. Hughes 228 and regards the others—in seven states—as doubtful. Each of the national chairmen expresses the utmost confidence that the ultimate results will
elect his candidate. With the contest narrowing steadily to close votes in the vital spots, recounts are almost inevitable and each side is on the watch for irregularities. There
is no assurance that the result will be fully known in another day.
At midnight returns, such as were complete or so far complete as to be regarded as indicative, gave President Wilson 232 votes in the electoral college, Hughes 239 and
left 60 doubtful in eight states. It requires 266 votes to elect a president. Although California still showed a l ad for the president and his campaign managers were claim
ing it by at least 15,000, the presidents majority there had dwindled to a little more than 1,400 with about one-fifth of the districts missing. In Minnesota, too, the Wilson
lead, which was as high as 10,000 early in the day, steadily decreased as the vote from the rural districts came in. During the evening Hughes took the lead with a small
margin and then the president shot ahead again, but w th less than a thousand votes. The republican managers cl limed the state on the final returns. Idaho was estimated
for the Wilson column with a majority of 10,000. Kansas, while incomplete, with a little more than two-thirds of th ' districts reported, showed President Wilson leading with
more than 27,000. Washington, a little more than half reported, was giving the president a lead of 7,000. West Virginia, two-thirds reported, was showing Hughes a majority
of 2,000. North Dakota was very close, two-thirds complete showing Hughes' majority of less than 1,000. Wilson was leading in New Mexico with only a small proportion
of the precincts reported. Delaware and New Hampsh re, counted among the Hughes states, but incomplete during the day, definitely turned into the republican column.
Tireless vigils were kept by anxious watchers tonight at headjuarters of both the democratic and republican national committees. Bulletins from states in which the results
publi
are still > n doubt were scanned even more eagerly than they were last night. Both Chairman Vance C. McCormick for the democrats and William R. Willcox for the
jeans professed undiminished confidence in the outcome. The former was somewhat more explicit in his claims. After dining with Charles E. Hughes, Mr. Willcox made a state
ient * * n which he said: "We ask only what is fair. We want only what is fair. We want only what we are entitled to and that we propose to have." Earlier in the day Mr.
McCormick announced that he had sent telegrams to state and county chairmen in doubtful states, telling them to keep careful guard over the ballot boxes and their contents.
Attorney General Gregory visited democratic national headquarters and was closeted with the chairman, but it was asserted his visit was of no special significance. Eater in
the afternoon Mr. McCormick conferred with John B. Stanchfield and Delaney Nicoll, prominent democratic lawyers. The possibility of an official count being necessary in
states where the margin of apparent victory for one presidential candidate or the other is slight, was freely discussed at both headquarters. Leaders of both parties in all parts
on the country, especially in the west, were in constant touch by telegraph and telephone, with headquarters in this city. Apparently the rank and file of Wilson adherents
who had no opportunity to celebrate last night, were determined to make up tonight for what they had missed. A crowd of such proportions that it blocked traffice for blocks in
Forty-second street gathered in front of democratic headquarters. Two bands joined forces in playing "The Star Spangled Banner," and all kinds of noise making implements
were used enthusiastically. ___

raised his hat and bowed, smiling
broadly. Mrs. Wilson accompanied
him.
