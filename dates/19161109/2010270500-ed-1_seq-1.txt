Lutheran Church Notes
DAKOTA CITY-SALEM
County Agent's Field Notes
BY A. H. BECKHOFF.
Within the past few weeks several
calls have come from parties who
have had one or more sick cattle,
and as far as one could tell by super
ficial examiaation at least three of
tluse animals, in as many herds, had
pretty well advanced cases of tuber
culosis. One herd has since been
tested by a veterinarian and five of
the animals reacted. They were sent
to the killers and all showed the post
mortem lesions of the disease and
three were so badly diseased that
their carcasses were condemned.
One of the animals which were con
demned had been furnishing milk
for the family use. To say that
there are other herds in the county,
probably in the same condition, is
noc an exageration, for some of
the animals show it quite plainly and
there is no telling how. many others
might be reacters though to all ap
pearances in pefect condition.
This condition cannot be countinan
ced without considerable alarm, for
no greater menance confronts the
diaryman in this state than this, for
animals effected are sure to sooner
or later succumb and delay may be
the cause of the ruination of many
good herds. This aspect is of minor
importance when one thinks of the
health of the people which is apt to
be endangered by the use of milk
from infected animals. There is
not a shade of doubt any more but
that tuberculocis in cattle and hu
man beings are exactly the same dis
ease, and to quote Dr. Welch, of
Montana. "Thousands of cases can
be cited where the disease in chil
dren has been traced directly to the
milk of tuberculosis cows."
While we may have our suspicions
that by their appearance certain an
imals are infected, there is no abso
lute way of telling except be use of
the tuberculin test, and that this
evidence is conclusive is without
doubt. Such animals as do react
should at once be'sent to the slaugh
ter house. It is not hard to keep a
herd free, providing one is careful
not to introduce infected animals
and tests the herd now and then, to
be sure that there are no sick cases
at home.
If you purchase any dairy cattle,
get them subject to test before
bringing them into your herd. Sev
eral parties have asked me about get
ting their herds tested. Let me say
here that in this state only register
ad veterinarians are permitted to
do this work, but wherever I can
group the work in such a way, or
assist in the work preparatory to the
testing I shall bo glad to do so.
Three or four herds which are close
together can very conveniently be
treated at the same time with quite
a saving of time and money. Think
it over and if you have a few milch
cows get them tested before it is too
late.
Card of Thanks.
We wish in this manner to extend
our sincerest thanks to those who
so kindly and willingly assisted us
in our bereavement, in the loss of
our mother, Mrs. Amanda Fueston.
The Children
and Relatives.
The Emmanuel ladies will hold an
apron sale and supper at the old
Eagle building on Friday, Novem
ber 17. We are satisfied you can't
go wrong on the supper, and as for
the aprons, well there are aprons
and aprons, and these are aprons.
In the first place these are hand
made. Next, examine the stuff and
see if the body of the material is
starch as it is in most cheap aprons,
which washes out the first time
through the water.
The Salem Ladies' Aid will meet
at the home of Mrs. Edward Mor
gan on Thursday, November 23, at
2 p. m., because of Thanksgiving
falling on the regular date. The
serving committee are Mrs. Chas
Sierk, Mrs. Wm. Ostmeyer, Mrs.
Herman Ebel, and Mrs. Ed Morgan.
How many people in a community
really appreciate a church in their
midst. They look upon a Bchool
house as a necessity, which it is.
But we wonder how many realize
that the protestant church iH the
founder and maintainor of the pub
lic school b stem. Wo do not mean
that if Salem were todissappear that
the school houses in the community
would disappear along with it, but
if the influence of the protestant
church were to weaken to little or
nothing the public school system
would go with it.
It is said by many that a church
in a community increases land values
to some extent. It is said by many
others they would not want to live
where there is no church, these and
others sometimes contribute to the
support of the church that it may
thrive. But just this much is very
largely like buying a thing, paying
for it, and then leaving it in the
store when you leave. Some people
think that the church of Jesus Christ
asks for support and then gives
nothing in return, it doesn't, it
never did, it never will. Just disa
buse your mind of such a notion.
There is not an individual case where
the church in a community does not
have an influence, direct or indirect.
Some men do not profit directly by
the state agricultural experiment
stations, but none would say they
were no good. If you want to get
the most good from them, do as they
advise in farm ways, and it you
want to get value received for the
money you put into the church, do
as they adviso in the matter of your
life. The trouble is many live so
much for the day, and for the flesh,
they forget they have a heart and
soul to be cared for. They are so
engrossed in feeding and clothing
the body they wholly lose sight of
the fact that the finer emotions and
sensibilities of life arc those of the
spirit. Know this, that the spirit of
a man when it is right can overcome
the most adverse conditions, and the
most faverable conditions cannot
make a man happy if his spirit is not
happy. Don't you know the rich are
not the happy people? A city school
teacher who has taught in a number
of great cities writes in the L. H. T.
that she looks back on her country
school teaching as her happiest teaching.
Cultivate your Bpint as you culti-
I vate vour corn, the very best is none
to good for it. How many tell the
pastor "Yes, I know the church is
good, it is good to bo a christian, I
ought to line up I suppose," etc.
Now if your spirit is so great, it is
worth cultivating and in the culti
vating, when you undertake it seri
ously, the church rightly claims your
consideration and you will appreci
ate it for its real help. The church
will help you if you let it.
Next Sunday we will speak espe
cially to the boys.

M. E. Church Notes.
We wish to call attention to the
evening service on Sunday, next.
The first of a series of addresses on
the great mission fields of the church
will be given. It is probable that
wo will consider first Armenia. The
tragedy of that country is so fresh
in our minds and needs so much of
our consideration, wo can not do
better than study the situation and
some of the factors that have help
ed to produce it.
