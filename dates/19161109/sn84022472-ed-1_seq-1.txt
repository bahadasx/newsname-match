Stories pf Expenditure of Huge Sums of, Money

v ers Follow Rfetunts , FrohT Election Which
I Show County to Have Given Practically All of
A he Hughes Plurality of the Whole State.
; Why did Fairfield county,. which differs in alrriost no re
spect' from other industrial communities in Connecticut give a
'plurality for Hughes of 4,199, when all the rest of the state gave
a plurality of 1,293 for Hughes? : V ' " - -
This is the question which State-Attorney Homer- S. Cum
mings is 'preparingHo solve, as increasing reports come into him
of the' excessive use of money, of the employment Of an extraor
dinary number of "workers", and of other election methods for
bidden ny the Corrupt Practices Acts of state and nation.
Said Mr. Cummings, today, to a rep
resentative of The Farmer:
"Kepresentations, have 'been , made
to me regarding; election methods in
Fairfield county which seenVto make
it necessary that the ' returns . should
toe investigated, "and that "means
should be taken to probe the excessive
, use of money -which seems to have
,. taken place. . :.
Mr.' Cummings declined to. "say
Tvh at representations had tyeen made,
saying that the cause of justice might
"be defeated. But it is known that
liteially scores of , facts point to very
serious conditions which In glaring
impropriety much exceed the facts
ibrouffht out 'by .the investigation into
the campaign methods of E. J. Hill,
two years ago. "' , '
. Connecticut has'a population of 1,
; 114,1 19.- i : : , V : '
Fairfield county , has only 245,322
of this population. '
Thei state gave Hughes only 1,293
outside the county. .
But inside the county Hughes got,
by the face of the returns, 4,199.
- .-One-fifth of the population - gave
i Hughes about four times as much
plurality, as the other four-fifths. .
This disproportionate, unexpected,
unusual and peculiar result. has at
tracted the attention of national cam
paign managers on both sides. It will
not go unscrutinized.
In the interest of a pure ballot the
proper authorities will inquire as to
"aese facts. v ,
How much money came into
Connecticut, and how much in
; to Fairfield county? .
Who gave the money?
Who received it in, Bridgeport,
in the coun y and in the state?
Who paid it outand what was
it paid out for?
How many men were employed
as workers in Fairfield county?
, Were 1,000 employed, or 2,000,
or more?
i . Who paid these workers, how
,'. much did they get and what were
'S the terms of their employment
There are many,. .and grave facts
that require explanation, which will
have, to be explained.
One of . the features of the election
is the following letter, which was sent
to a gentleman in. Bridgeport asking
;him for funds, to make it impossible
for Republicans to" lose in close dis
tricts, because certain work would be
- done. . . - ' , '
Federal authority wants t6 know if
.Fairfield county was one of the close-
districts, in which money was to be
mobilized and certain work done so
that it would be impossible to lose.
This Is the letter:
My Dear Mr. :
We are again appealing to a
few prominent business men to
help us at this time. If we can
raise funds eulnclent to allow it, "
we will complete an organization
In each close district, that it will
J
be impossible to lose.
We know how business men
like you are called upon and it is
really embarrassing to the mem-
1 - bers of .1 this committee tq - have
to worry men like yourself, but
we are giving our entire time to
, thework and must, raise some
more money at once, and i pur
f only chance is by calling on those
.who are interested in the success
of our efforts. .
- If you' knew ? the absolute ne
cessity of certain, work tov be done,
whatsit means toward the success
of our movement, and could see
the judicious manner in which
every dollar raised by , this com
mittee is -being expended, I feel
quite confident that-you Would
, either help us yourself . or get
some of your friends interested to
' the extent of making a' contribu-
tion. What is to be done , niust
' .be accomplished within a week,
so please advise us at once.
, Very truly yours,
, R. M. AUSTIN,
Chairman Finance Committee.

order to avoid being struck he
changed - his course to" the opposite
side of the street. Then he ran into
Schrader's car. The court found that
the cyclist became frightened and sud
denly swerved when ' he heard the
horn on Tucker's machine. He said

on the part of the ' defendants and he
allowed them to recover costs.

NEW HAMPSHIRE
VOTE IS CLOSE;
WILSON IN LEAD
President Told That He Has
. Slight Majority, In
That State.
. Concord, N. H., Nov. 9 With re
turns complete but only partially ver
ified 'officially, Wilson led in New
Hampshire this morning by 93 votes,
according to Secretary of State Edwin
C. Bean. Discovery of . errors in of
ficial reports was a factor in revers
ing the lead which Hughes held last
night, he said. Mr. Bean said returns
from 120 6f the 274 towns and wards
still to be verified might further
change the result.
The official figures from 77 of these
missing districts have been received
but not tabulated. Secretary Bean, in
announcing the difference o"f 93. in
favor of Wiison, gave no total figures.
Totals upon which his preliminary
statement wasvbased had been reached
he explained, by adding to the. verified
returns newspaper figures from the
districts not heard from officially.
"We found several errors," said
Secretary Bean. "One clerk in Ward
8, Concord, reported the vote of that
precinct as 'Hughes 225, Wilson 88,.'
Our knowledge of local conditions
made us doubt this result. Investiga
tion showed it should have been Wil
son 225, Hughes 88. We are scan
ning the returns very closely, realiz
ing that the slightest ' error may
change the result not only in the state
but in the nation."
The returns are being delivered1 to
the secretary of state by special de
livery mail on the official blanks.
The Democratic state committee,
when Hughes was reported leading
last night, was said to have decided
to petition for a recount of the vote.
Long Branch, N. J., Nov. 9 Presi
dent Wilson was informed at 10:25
o'clock in a telegram from Senator
Hollis, of New Hampshire, of the
change in the New Hampshire vote
giving Wilson a lead of ,93 votes. Sen
ator Hollis declaring that Mr. Wilson
had carried the state by that plu
rality. - ,
"Congratulations," he concluded. , '
At 11 o'clock the President was
given a complete summary jf the
news to date. Although the word
transmitted to Mr. Wilson was almost
entirely favorable, he reserved judg
ment. Hughes' Plurality
In Indiana Is Cut
Indianapolis, Ind., Nov. 9 Charles

son's plurality 117.
With President Wilson assured of 251 elec
toral votes, and Charles E. Hughes certain of 243,
the presidential election result today hinges upon
the result in five states where the race is extreme
ly close.
These states, with their electoral votes, are:
California, 13; Minnesota, 12; North Dakota,
5; New Hampshire, 4; New Mexico, 3. The total !
electoral vote of these states is 37.
President Wilson's party managers are most
optimistic "It all over," said Democratic Chair
man Vance C. McCormick today. "We have clean
ed them up." He claims 288 electoral votes for the
President 1 .
RepubHcan party leaders, after claiming Min
nesota, reposed that the official count would have
to be awaiteein f ther states. t
iTIibigs Overnight surprise Was the switclWn
New Hampshire. Claimed as sure Republican, it is
extremely doubtful. President Wilson shows a
lead of 121 with two small towns yet unreported.
North Dakota, classed yesterday as Republi
can, is doubtful. With less than 200 precincts miss
ing, President Wilson has a lead of 902 votes.
New Mexico, which was in the Democratic
column yesterday, is wavering. Half of the pre
cincts have reported, showing a lead of 257 for
Hughes.
California has maintained a plurality of be
tween 4,000 and 5,000 in all returns received from
midnight until 2 o'clock this afternoon. Republi
can state committeemen there say their estimate
totals for the state show Wilson leading by a few
hundred votes. v
In Minnesota, President Wilson has cut
Hughes early morning lead of over 1,200 to less
than 300.
West Virginia and Oregon, doubtful yet, have,
gone for Hughes, late returns indicate.
