ELECTION
N DOUBT
As we go to press the election
of president is still in doubt,
with both Bides claiming it.
The result in New Mexico is
very close and in doubt.
No detailed results are obtain
able from this county at this
time.
We expect to be able to give
the official vote of the county
next week.
Reports from the various pre
cincts indicate that the entire
Republican ticket is elected, all
by good majorities except Ro
mero, between whom and Sanch
ez the race is close.
Estancia precinct was some
what of a surprise to the Demo
crats. In a total of 186 votes,
the Democrats had but 22 ma
jority on the head of the ticket
The local candidates ran ahead.
ELECTION JUDGES
IN TROUBLE
In Lucero precinct the two Re
publican judges appointed by the
commissioners, presumably Max
Montoya and Lorenzo Barela,
took the ballot box and poll books
to a house several miles distant
from the polling place named by
the commissioners, and refused
to go to the designated polling
place or to give up the ballot box
and poll books. Deputy sheriff
Robinson went out and showed
them the election proclamation
and the law, but it had no effect.
An election board was organ
ized at the designated place, and
38 Democrats and three Social
ists voted there.
Eighteen Republicans voted at
the other place.
At noon today deputy U. S.
marshals arrived from Santa Fe
and went out to place the re
calicitrant judges under arrest.
AUCTION SALE
At the Wagner yard in Estan
cia I will sell at public auction on
Saturday, November 18th, 1916,
at 2 o'clock sharp, one black
work horse 5 years" old, weight
1100 pounds; one span of good
brood mares 8 and 9 years old,
weight 1000 pounds each; two
long yearling colts, two spring
colts, one 3-yr-old cow, 3 spring
calves. -I. W. Turner. S. N.
Jenson, auctioneer.
W. W.
WAGNER'S
COLT SHOW
W. W. Wagner's colt show last
Saturday suffered the fate of
everything that is postponed,
and wasn't as big as it would
have been otherwise, as people
got mixed on the dates.
But there was a good bunch of
very fine colts in competition,
C. W. Bowers, of Davis, Cali
fornia, the man who was to have
been judge, again telegraphed
that he could not be here on the
second date set, and Mr. Wagner
thought it best not to try another
postponement, so he secured the
services of J. I. Wilcoxen of Ford,
Kansas, an experienced horse-
iman.
Mr. wucoxen saia it was an
exceptionally high class bunch of
colts, all deserving premiums.
but he had to choose between
them.
The premium winners were as
follows:
J. P. Moe's colt " Joe" first.
Frank Comer'B colt "Iron
Mask" second.
J. L. Smith's filley "Dutch"
third.
Ira Allman's filley "Jeannette"
fourth.
J. J. Smith's filley ''MoHie"
fifth.

wishing to reach them by letter
can do so after December 1st at

M, E. LADIES' AID
The Ladies' Aid met Tuesday
afternoon with Mrs. Mason.
Fifteen were present eleven
members and four visitors. The
afternoon was spent in quilting
and making plans for a two days
dinner to be given November
22nd and 23rd. We want all
members and friends to feel that
they have a part in helping to
make this a success, as we need
all the help possible. Two new
members were enrolled at this
meeting. There is much en
thusiasm and the society is gain
ing steadily in membership and
attendance. Let us not be weary
in well doing, but all take hold
with a will.
Talking about land values and
rents, this valley certainly can
beat the earth in the matter of
the percentage of income on the
value of rented land. T. F. Mul
len rented to E. U. Brown 57
acres, part of which was planted
in beans and part in corn. t His
share of the crop on the 57 acres
is worth in cash on the market
today $700. What do you think
of that? It will be remembered
that Mr. Mullen sold off his stuff
a year ago, rented all his land
and went back to Kansas intend
ing to stay. But he soon got
enough of it, and was back last
spring. He bought off the rent
er on part of his land, and farmed
what was broke out on his son's
place also. He raised a thousand
pounds of beans to the acre on
his on his own land, and 750
pounds to the acre on the other,
which had not been farmed for
several years.
The Valley Auto Co. got in a
car of Fords today, and have two
more carloads on the road.
