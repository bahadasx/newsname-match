How Electoral Vote
StaMsimtest
The table belowjives the latest information obtainable upon the way
the states vent in the votisg for presidential electors yesterday. Each
state is put In the Republican, Democratic or doubtful column upon the
best information which has come by cable. After each state is put the
number of the electoral votes it possesses.
These standings are likely to be changed at any time by late news, but
this is the situation is it stood this afternoon in New York: .
Eight states with a total of 59 electoral votes are in the doubtful ccl
umn. Some of the spates in the Wilson or Hughes column are slightly in
doubt but indication point pretty clearly to their ultimate location. Thua
Washington is placed in the Wilson column, though opposing claims are
still made for It. N ' '
J The changes iruthe three columns
'follows: , '.;
North Dakota has awung from the Hughes column to the doubtful col
umn. Idaho swung vfrom thf ; Hughes column to the Wilson column. To
offset the loss of thfs total i 9 electoral votes, Hughes got Indiana out
of the dovttful column, with 15 votes, and Oregon with 5 votes. In neither
of these is the count'complete, but the Indiana count gives Hughes a sub
stantial lead and the latest reports from Oregon indicated his victory there.
New Mexico, which was put in the Wilson column last night, is now in
the doubtful column, taking 3 from the Wilson total. But Wilson has added
Idaho, 4 votes, Arizona, 3 votes, and Montana, 4 votes, Arizona and Montana
having come out of the doubtful column. ;
Last night there were 10 states distinctly doubtful. This number has
been decreased by two, four being moved into the Hughes or Wilson col
umns and one added from each North Dakota and New Mexico.;
Of the states In the doubtful column, Wilson has the better chance.
He is leading in California, leading by a slight margin in New Hampshire,
likely to take Nebraska and New Mexico, where he is also leading. Hughes
appears to have the better chance in Minnesota and West Virginia.
One feature which may upset all these electoral vote calculations is that
if the states are extremely close, there may be a split in the electoral state
delegations. Tnus there might be a split in the New Hampshire vote of 4,
possibly in the California vote, etc.

NEW YORK, N. Y., Nov. 9. The returns in the elections
throughout the states for congress show that control of both
branches will still be in Democratic hands.
The standing in the house, however, will be relatively
close. So far there are 212 Democrats certainly elected and 203
Republicans. Sixteen congressional district returns are miss
ing. Of these, seven are likely to be Democratc and nine
Republican.
NEW YORK, N.,Y., Nov. 9. At 3 o'clock this afternoon
the presidential fight is so sensationally close that a demand
for a recount of the votes in the hard-fought states is indicated.
With five states still in doubt, the national chairmen are
unwilling to concede anything decisive. Neither Chairman
Willcox of the Republicans nor Chairman McCormick of the
Democrats will concede that the balance is swinging to the
opposition candidate. At both headquarters there is talk of
demanding an official" recount of the ballots, each 'claiming
that its candidate is likely to get more votes than the count
has so far shown.
Both headquarters also announce that precautions are
being taken to guard the ballot boxes, evidence of the bitter
ness of the struggle.
NEW YORK, N. Y., Nov. 9. Henry Morgenthau, chairman
of the Democratic national campaign finance committee, was in
charge of Democratic headquarters early in the day in the
absence of Vance McCormick. He asserted that a recount will
be demanded of the vote in New Hampshire, where the race is
neck-and-neck and the Republicans claim the state has gone
for' Hughes..' -:y
Later in the day McCoimick came down. He reiterated
his claim that the Democrats will have 288 electoral votes and
claimed that North Dakota, California, New Mexico and New
Hampshire are all for Wilson.
GUARDSMEN TO DECIDE
The final count in Minnesota is so close that the officials
refuse to declare the X state anything but doubtful until it is
possible to count and tabulate the votes of the 2500 Minnesota
national guardsmen on the border. The last returns from the
state showed Hughes leading with a total of 163,088 to Wilson's
162,285. U---X'M- ;X-'i?y--
In all probability, as the guardsmen voted so the state with
its twelve electoral college votes will go. The guardsmen's
since yesterday's last extra are as

hardest-fought national election of a generation; Republican:
