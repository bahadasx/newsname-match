COMPLArFS FROM HARTFORD
Defeated Candidate in Senate Race
Urges Probe of Alleged Con
necticut Irregularities.
(Ey the Inteenatienal News Serviee.)
New York. Nov. &.-So close is the race
for the Presidency that both National
committees, facing the possibility of de
feat, are planning recounts of the vote
for Presidential electors in States where
the pluralities are suspiciously small.
From Concord, N. H.. comes word that
the Democratic National Committee had
Instructed the State committee to apply
for a recount of the ballots. The secre
tary of state. Edwin C. Bed&, announced
tonight that Hughes' plurality was 1I1.
He did not rive the vote for the .
dates. It was iindiel a=9 -
Bean's announcement that the State com
mittee served notice of its Intention to
demand a recount. Its notice was sup
plemented by S. statement that all the
expenses had been guaranteed by the Na
tional committee.
From Hartford. Conn.. comes word that
: defeated candidate for State senator has
asked that the vote for Presidential elec
tors in the entire State he Impounded,
pending the Investigation of certain al
frged irregularities In Fairfield County.
This county includes Bridgeport, where
there is a tremendous new population, due
to the demand for munitions.
Only twice in the history of the United
States has the electoral vote been In ques
lion. The first time was in the came of
A"aron Burr and Thomas Jefferson. Ini.
hat case there was a tie, asd the election
was thrown into the House of Represent
itiver. The second time was when ari
lectoral commission had to be appointed
to determne whether Samuel J. Tilden
'r Rutherford B. Hayes was entitled to
he Prci.dency.
Charges of Fraud.
Out of the Hays-Tilden campaign many
charges of fraud grew, and popular feel
inz rose to a high pitch.
A situation such as the present one, If
,nntests are entered upon seriously, prom
i-s a long and bitter struggle.
Despite every effert to hasten decisions
in courts, it is possible that the legal
status of electoral votes from some of
the States whose vote Is In question
might not be determined until after
March 4. This would produce an un
precedented situation.
In the Hays-Tilden controversy, both
sides were In a compromising mood. So;
the expedient of an electoral commiasalen
was resorted to. This commission had
no basis in law. Even President Wilson:
refers to it as extra-constitutional.
Whether. in the event of Inability to
adjudicate the differences In the present
contest the Republican and Democratic
managers wthld agree upon some such
expedient cannot be predicted.
Chairman McCormack was visited by
Attorney General Gregory. Delancy
Nichol. and John B. Staunchheld. The
presence of all these lawyers gave rise
to the report that contents were being
planned on a large scale.
Chairman McCormick sent out this
telegram to every State and country
chairman in States where the vote ap
peared to be close:
"President Wilson will be re-elected.
.Our opponents are desperate. You must
personally see that the ballot boxes are
guarded and protected and that nothing
be left undone to safeguard the victory."
Mr. McComick was asked whether his
telegram and the presence of the lawyers
Indlead a plan to force a recount -til
several of the States. Re saim: f coue,
If there is a recount of the ballots we
shall need the best counset obtainable."

WILLCOX CERTAIN
HUGHES WILL WIN
Hies and Hitchcock Also
Keep Up Courage.
(by the ies..ts.aml News Sevie.)
New York. Nov. ,-It was a day of
tense anglety at Republican National
Headquatters today.
The place resembled the great head
quarters of a commander-in-chief. All
day long orders were being dispatched to
deld commanders.
A favorable bulletin caused great inter
est In spite of the fact that every one was
exhausted mentally and physically. But
the enthusiasm did not last. It would
be dampened by some adverse news. It
seemed as if favorable and unfavorable
bulletins were alternating, throughout the
whole day.
Chairman Willcox Insisted that the
election of Mr. Hughes was assured. He
said there were many combinations of
States that would give the victory to the
Republicans.
Former National Committee Chairman
Charles D. Hilles and Frank H. Hitch
cock visited the headquarters several
times during the day. They told Mr.
Willcox and his assistant to keep up their
courage.
Starting upon the hypothesis that 243
electoral votes had been assured. the
board of strategy that surrounded Mr.
Willcox began wiring to all of the State
chairmen to produce the needed twenty
four votes.
The board of strategy announced in the
late afternoon that Oregon. New Mexico
and North Dakota, all of which had been
conceded to Wilson, had been brought
back into the Republican column.
NEW WE MS
Official Count May Be Required to De
termine Winning Candidate.
(By the internatieal News Service.)
Albuquerque, N. M.-New Mexico Is so
close as between Hughes and Wilson that
the offcial count may be required to as
certain how the electoral vote of the
State will be cast. The returns are ex
ceedingly slow coming in. only fifteen of
the twenty-ail counties of the State hav
ing been heard from and the count in
only two of these being complete.
Figuring on a basis of the returns re
ceived. official and unofficial. Hughes
seems to have carried thirteen counties
by a plurality aggregating 6.0, and Wil
son thirteen counties by a plurality ag
gregating 6,42. These figures. however.
are exceedingly conservative and give
Hughes the best of it where there is any
doubt. Wilson probably has carried the
State by about 1.000, but this estimate
may be upset by returns from the coun
ties which so far have not been heard
from.
WE1SON'S BROTHER CERTAIN.
Baltimore. Nov. 8.-Joseph R. Wilson,
brother of Woodrow Wilson, having re
fused to give up hope Of Wilson's selec
tion, even when returns were blackest,
shortly before inidnight, is confidently
awaiting official word from Shadow Lawn
of his brother's re-election.
Mr. Wilson. with his wife and daugh
ter, Miss Alice Wilson. watched the re
turns from an automobile on the down
town streets last night, until the general
gloom of the situation threatened to get
the best of their hopes.
They reurned to their apartment at the
Severn shortly before midnight, and hav
ing received word early this morning that
the tide was beginning to show signs of
turning toward Wilson retired in a more
cheerful frame of mind.
Elevator Falls; Three Killed.
Chicago, Nov. 8.-Three persons were
killed and several Injured today when an
elevator, carrying more than a dosen men
and women, fell from an upper story at
the Florsheim Shoe Company's plant In
West Adams street.

DEMOCRATS HOLD
SENATE CONTROL
G. 0. P. Likely to Have Slight
Lead in House.
The sixty-fifth Congress, according to
Ildications last midnight. will be Damo
cratic in the Senate and Republican in the
House.
The latest returns indicate the Demo
erats will hold fifty-two seats in the
Senate and the Republicans forty-two.
In the House of Representatives there
will be 218 Republicans, 212 Domoprats,
three Progressivem, one Independent, one
Socialist and one Social-Democrat.
Practical balance of power will rest in
the hands of the emall group of Inde.
pendents, Progressives and gocnalnsts. un
less the Republicans pick up enough addi
tional seats in districts that are still
doubtful to give them a majority over all
others.
In any case, the Republican control will
be so slight that the six miscellanenus
members and a few independently-Inclined
Republicans, by kicking over the traces
rf the party whips, can upset the Repub
lican domination any time they please.
The Republicans still hoped last night
to carry the Senatorial contests In New
Mexico and Arizona, which remained in
doubt. Victories for them there would
cut the present Democratic majority of
sixteen to eight.
The Democrats lost four Senators, one
each in Maine, New York. New Jersey
and Maryland, while they gained one each
in Rhode Island. Delaware and Utah.
Late Congressional returns showed a
Republican giet gain of fourteen seats,
overturning the present Democratic lead
of twenty-three.
Among the moat surprising results were
the election of Peter Goelet Gerry over
Senator Henry F. Lppitt in roe isanid
th .9 of the RepubII4d canad
for Dr. J. 1. Franee, in Mar
land, and the defeat of Senator du Po
in Deiafare by J. 0. Wolcott. Democrat.
Dempocrats still hope for the election of
Scnator John W. Kern, majority leader
in the Senate, and Thomas Taggart, in
Indiana. The latest returns, however,
Sem to establish beyond a doubt the
victory of the Republican candidates,
Harry S. New and James E. Watson.
Another remarkable result was in Utah.
where Senator George Sutherland was
apparently defeated by King. Democrat.
FOUR DEAD IN ELECTION DUEL
Fatal Pistol Fight Fellows Arg

and Mentana on List.
Chicago, Nov. .-"Drys" have won in

braska and Montana-according to Oliver
W. Stewart, National Prohibition cam
paign manager.
"We saved Arkansas to the array of
nineteen dry States, with which we en
tered the campaign," he said. "The elec
tion of Bamberger as governor of Utah
means prohibition by statute out there, I
believe for Bomberger favors prohibition.
We think that the victory for woman suf
frage In South Dakota will mean the
rigid enforcement of prohibition laws In
that State."

New York, Nov. 9.-At midight tonight the closest Presidential
election in thirty-two years appeared to hang upon the results in the
States of California and New Mexico.
Wilson. leading in both these States, has enough sure electoral
votes, in the event of his carrying them, with their combined voe of
16. He had been gainig steadily in California from 4 o'clock a e
aftenoon, when he took the lead over Hughs in the ret-m. In
the faw scatteraing retnme reci froniNew Mexico, Mr. \a"
appeared to have far the better cance in that State.
In addition to California and New Mexico, with 16 votes.
Hampshire, with 4. and West Virginia, with 8 remain in th doulkul
cohumn.
WE.L CONT T E n .
Furthermore it was announced by Homer Cunmins. Democratic
candidate for United States Senator in Connecticut. that he intended
to file a contest against the casting of the electoral vote for Hughes
on the ground of gross irregularities.
-In New Hampshire the unoficial count gave Hughes- a plurality
of 161. 'Ihis will be contested, and te oficial count will be re
quired to decide who has won the State.
The big outstanding feature of the remarkable contest at mid
night-was that President Wilson had decidedly the better of it on the
face of the returns, but thus far there absolutely is no justification
for a definite forecast of victory for either candidate.
Claims of the election of narrow pluralities were put forth by
both parties at minight.
CLAIMS WEST VIRGDIIA BY 3,AS.
Democratic Chainnan McCormick was given a pledge by Senator Watson
and other leaders in West Virguiia that that State would go for Wilson by
at least 3,000.
In addition to this, Mr. McCormick was sure of California by better
than the 6.000 plurality claimed there by the Democratic State chaima.
North Dakota, Mr. McCormick was assured, had been slipped into the Rqmb
lican or doubtful column by a mistake in figures. which had been corrected.
giving it to Wilson by a plurality of imm 1.000 to 1,500.
The California situation on the face of returns at midnight strongly
indicated a swing to Wilson. If the ratio then being niaitained by figures
already in is continued Wilson will carry the State by a safe plurality.
Counties yet to be heard from are about evenly divided, Los Angeles being
decidedly Republican and the others Democratic.' In Las Angeles the count
ing has been held up over night.
