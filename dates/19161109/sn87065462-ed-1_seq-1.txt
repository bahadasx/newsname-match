Water Works Week
November 12th to 18th is set

To th6 People of Mississippi: , .
Nothing " contributes to V:the
health, comfort, and well being

exaggerated idea of the cost of;
putting running water in "tie

valent'in the minds of the farm
ers. To dispel this common mis-j
takrf and to promote the installa-
tion of the simple low cost water
works together With a Sanitary
waiter supply throughout 'odr
ruraf immunities: the -various
organizations of our state have
allied themselves and are fur

all interested. With over

stop, take -account of these f.icLs
and to' do what lies in our power
tu change tkese conditions. To
do the most effective work in
this calls for a united effort on
the part of all our people. There
is a prevailing idea that only the
cities and towns need water
works; that only town homes
need running water. Good sani-
otion demands running water in
cur homes as much so in the
rural districts as in the cities and

plyng between Knoxviile and

reached his attractive home. on
Scott street, when he was met
by the Tanlac man.
"I am indeed glad you called,"

his spacious parlor."" For sever

have been reading the testimoni
als of Knoxviile citizens regard
ing the beneficial effects derived
from taking this wonderful med
icine, and I had promised my
wife to go up to the Kuhlman-
Chambliss Drug Companys,drug
store and tell them what Tanlac
had done for me, but have been
too busy.
"My restoration to health is
the talk of the railroad yards,
i and every day I am being con
gratulated by my friends upon
how well I look. ;
"I had for years been afflicted
with" catarrh and stomach troub
le," continued Capt. Miller,
"and when spring came I was in
a wretched run-down condition,
a. walking skeleton, if you please,
and just1 had to drag myself
about. Before I became afflicted
with the terrible . double com
plaint I weighed 190 pounds, and
was strong, robust and healthy.'
I went from bad to worse and
occasionly was patched up, but
nothing I took in the way of
medical treatment reached the
jjl-'v, i woo Uil LUC VCjyc UJ-
taking an extended lay-off from
my duties. ' I
"I could scarcely eat anything
at all, and what I did eaU-eemed j
to sour on my stomach. I would
iili up with gr.s and seemed to
be bloate'd all the time, and my
suffering was intense. My
stomach would pain me and burn
like .'a coal of fire. I was so con
stipated I had to take .a purga
tive pillet every night to get any
temporary relief. I was cross
and fretful aad so nervous that
I never enjoyed a night's sleep.
Hissing steam, the noise of the
train and the ringing of the bell
grated" on my" nerves and all
through the hours of the night.1
could hear these noises. .
"At times I would have dizzy
spells and . would stagger and
frequently had palpitation of the
heart. This was my condition
whenJjeard. of Tanlac. I was
willing to try; anything to ' get
well,, and started hi on. a. bottle.
In a few days I noticed a 'marked
I improvement - jn W condition,
and sant- and bought -six. more
bottles, '"i haye'taken seven'bot
ties and here I am, in better
health. thaft.ii'have enjoyed-for
twenty years.. . ' . -.

gained twenty-three pounds, as I
told 'you before; T arn hot cfohsti-'

wellflnd of mornings my wife
has to pull meout of bed I sleep so
soundly. . I sleep all night with-j
out hearing steam whistles and
moving cars, and my nerves are
now strong and I hardly know
myself, so great has been my'
transformation from a weak, !
run-down man to a strong, ro
biist, healthy condition that is
the talk of all those who know
me."
