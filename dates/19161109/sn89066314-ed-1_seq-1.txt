Woodrow Wilson', holding 269 electoral votes, this aft
ernoon is assured of re-election to the Presidency. Califor
nia, with 13, is conceded to him. North Dakbta, with 5, is
certainly Democratic, the United Press assured the MlS
SOURIAN late this afternoon. The Kansas City. Star admits
that Wilson has a plurality of 750 in this doubtful state, with
only the National Guard still to be heard from. And the
soldiers, reports show, are supporting the President. Hughes'
lead in Minnesota, with one-tenth of the precincts yet to come
in, was 501 votes and dwindling. Hughes leads in New
Hampshire and New Mexico, but only about half of the
precincts in the latter have reported.
Admit Election of Wilson
By United Press
EW YORK, Nov. 9. The tide for Wilson set In so strong In California;
and Minnesota late this afternoon that it appeared that probably by 4
o'clock the returns from these two states would indicate the President's re
election. .
Tno Philadelphia newspapers which had strongly supported Hughes in the
campaign this afternoon admitted the
the Evening Ledger and the North American. ,The belief Is that the Wilson
drift would result in h!s re-election was based on these developments.
Hughes must earrj both Minnesota and California to win. -
Wilson's lend in California is steadily being maintained.
Hughes' lead In Minnesota is being cut down as further returns come in.
The precise drift in these and the other smaller doubtful states New
llampshire and 'cw Mexico, showed in the United Press returns available
at I o'clock, the following:
California .yi9 precincts out of 5,SG7 show Wilson leading by 5,055 votes.
Onl) 175 precincts to be heard from.
New Hampshire 248 out of 291 precincts show Hughes leading by 2791
votes. Onl 4G precincts to be heard from.
Minnesota 2,730 out of 3,024 precincts show Hughes leading by 501 votes.
Results still to come from 302 precincts.
New Mexico 33C out of G3S precincts show Hughes leading by 258 votes.
Results still to come from 302 precincts.
The Democrats claim they-can, if necessary, carry the state of New Hump
shire by court action.
Almost Certain for Wilson.

NEW YORK, Nor. 9. Wilson is
within ten electoral votes of re-elect-'n.
Hughes must gain twenty-three
" he is to obtain a majority. This
was the outstanding feature of the
Progress of otes this afternoon. With
256 votes assured for Wilson in the
United Press returns, California alone
w Minnesota alone would be sufficient
to make Wilson the twenty-ninth Pres
ident of the United States.
Hughes, to win, must carry both
California and Minnesota. California
exhibited a sudden turn to Wilson, and
Minnesota is showing an equally
strong Hughes drift.
The soldier vote may decide the
election for the Presidency, according
to estimates of votes mailed from the

California Is still in doubt on the

Oliver W. Stewart, National Prohi

He also believes that the election of a

Country Vote Will Hardly
Overcome Hackmann Lead
of 33,241 in St. Louis.
John P. Gordon, "the state auditor
mho has been decidedly unfriendly to
the University during his last admin
istration, has been defeated for re
election by George E. Hackmann, his
Republican opponent In St. Louis
where the Post-Dispatch conducted a
strenuous campaign against Gordon,
Hackmann defeated the present audi
tor by a majority of 33,241 votes. This
vote against Gordon is so overwhelm
ing that with the close race on the
state ticket he has no chance to win.
He is the only man on the Democratic
state ticket who Is known to be de
feated. To show the .extent which the Demo
crats In St. Louis scratched Gordon,
Hughes majority over Wilson, was 10,J
016 and Lamm's majority over Gard
ner was 10,296 Uius Gordon ran far
behind both Wilson and Gardner.
If the state Democratic ticket is
elected, it appears now that the ma
jority will not be much more than 5,
000, which would mean that Gordon's
defeat was inevitable.
All three amendments were defeated
by St. Louis voters. Only 13,272 votes
were cast in favor of abolishIng1 the
brewery industry, and 140,900 oppos
ed It The land bank amendment was
badly beaten in-the city. While its
author was well-supported, his meas
ure was unpopular with St. Louisians.
It was defeated by 54,085 votes.
The blind amendment' was lost In
the city by a majority of 10,150.
State Auditor John P. Gordon, who
is reported defeated In his race for
re-election, was the low man on the
Democratic ticket In Boone County,
falling 356 votes behind A. M. Wood
son, candidate for Supreme Judge,
who led the Democratic ticket with
5,532 votes. Gordon received 5176
votes and Hackmann 2,394. Wilson
was the second man on the ticket get
ting 5518 votes against 2219 for
Hughes. Compared with the Demo
cratic ballot cast for president Gor
don's vote showed a falling off of 342
and with the gubernatorial ballot, a
shortage of 174, Gardner having re-
celved 5350 to Lamm's 2311 votes in

CLUB IS TO,B ABOUT PRINTING
Floral Business Also Taken Up At
Usual Weekly Luncheon.
The cost system in the modern
printing plant was discussed by Harry
S. Jacks of the Herald-Statesman
Publishing Company at the regular
Thursday luncheon of the Columbia
Commercial Club today at the Virginia
Grill. Mr, Jacks held that the printer
nas urmiy esiaDiisnea-nimseinn ine
business of every community and that
he is now a necessity, as his work is
more in demand now than eer be
fore. He said that with the introduc
tion of modern methods of accounting
the printing business has become suc
cessful as a business venture. "Co
lumbia printers can now turn out any
thing from a two-color poster to a
completely bound book," he said.
J. W. Bernard of the Columbia
Floral Company invited the business
men, as well as all the citizens, to
visit !iis new plant. The'florist in the
community is in demand now as he
has never been before, the speaker
held, in that there is such a spirit of
civic pride sweeping the country.
J. Sterling Moran of the Depart
ment of Agriculture, Washington, D.
C, spoke to the club regarding sur
veys of rural districts.
The club was favored with cigars,
given by the Virginia Pharmacy.
Chrysanthemums, sweet peas and car
nations were given to everyone pres
ent.
L. M. Defoe, president of the club,
read an excerpt from a letter from1 the
Santa Fe Railroad Company which
said that the policy of building more
tracks in Missouri was not favored, on
account of taxes imposed by the state.

CAPITAL CONCEDES
DEFEAT OF GORDON
Crossley and Britton Run
Neck and Neck Second
and Third Amendment Lost
Hope Held for First.
By United Press
JEFFERSON CITY, Nov. 9. Secre
tary of State Roach estimated today
that Colonel Gardner's plurality will
be from 4,000 to 6,000. He bases his
estimate on official returns from many
of the counties and partly on unofficial
returns. Wilson Is running 18,000
ahead of Gardner and Read in Mis
souri. Democrats this afternoon con
ceded Gordon's defeat by from 8,000
to 10,000.
The race for lieutenant-governor is
exceedingly close. Britton, Republi
can, gained more than 3,000 votes over
the ticket in St. Louis and ran far
ahead in Buchanan County. This has
given the Democrats a genuine scare,
lest Crossley be defeated.
That the dry Democrats scratched
Gardner extensively is strongly evi
denced from returns in dry localities.
With the exception of Crossley and
Gordon, the Democrats expect to carry
the state from 5,000 to 6.000. The Re
publicans will proDably control the
lower house of the Legislature by a
narrow margin.
The three constitutional amend
ments appear defeated. The only
ffiope is for thepensIon for the blind.
The big St Louis vote against the pro
hibition amendment assured its de
feat, but the state's vote was not any
thing like that of last election. The
Gardner Land Bank Bill was buried.
Few complete returns on these amend
ments are available.
State Ticket In Lead.
At noon today Circuit Clerk, J. E.
Boggs received a telephone message
from the State Democratic Headquar
ters at Jefferson City stating that the
entire state ticket with perhaps the
possible exception of John P. Gordon,
was safely in the lead.
CALLS THIS ELECTION UNUSUAL
HowcTer, Prof. F. F. Stephens Says
Close Votes Once Were Common. '
The presidential election this year
has been the closest held In the last
twenty years, according to Prof. F. F.
Stephens of the history department of
the University. Professor Stephens
says, however, that all elections from
1876 to 1896 were close.
In the 1876 election Tllden received
184 electoral votes to 185 for Hayes,
although Tilden had a popular plu-,
rality of more than 250,000. The re
sult of this election was not known
until the middle of the following Feb
ruary. The result of the electipn.of 1884
was not known for more than a week
after the votes were cast Cleveland
finally won over Blaine by an elec
toral majority of 37. He received a
popular plurality of only 23,000.
Four years later Harrison beat
Cleveland decisively in the electoral
tote, but Cleveland received a plurali
ty In the popular vote of more than
100,000. In 1892 Cleveland received a
majority both in the electoral college
and In the popular vote.
Two elections have been decided by
the House of Representatives, which
elects the President when no candi
date receives a majority of the elec
toral votes. In 1800 Jefferson and
Burr received the same number of
electoral votes. The House decided In
favor of Jefferson. Four candidates
were in the race in 1824. Jackson re
ceived the largest number of electoral
votes, but did not receive a majority.
The House of Representatives, voting
on the highest three candidates, Jack
son, Adams and Crawford, elected
Adams.
