was assured by a safe majority in the
electoral colleRe.
"The President is sure of California
and Minnesota," he said. "Besides
these, North Dakota, Kansas, New
Mexico, New Hampshire, and West
Virginia are ours. Tho Republicans
are not sure of a single state west of
the Mississippi except Iowa, which
they have won by a greatly reduced
plurality."

New York, November !) On t lie sec
ond day after the American people
cast their presidential ballots. Iha re
sult still is in doubt ami the contest
bit ween President Wilson anil Charles
lOvans Huglr.'s has narroweil ilnwn to
a point where it may be decided by a
few Western states.
It is within the range of possibilities
that the vote of national minrilsnicn
on border duty might turn some of the
doubtful states from one column o
another. Based on actual returns re
ceived by the Associated I'res's, tho
electoral college now gives Hughes
Wilson 240. and leaven fifty-two
votes doubtful.
Two of the metropolitan newspapers
which supported Hughes give him '2.VI
votes. President Wilson HI and ad
mit the doubtful character of only
California. New Mexico nnd Minnesota
Another, which supported the Presi
dent agrees with its contemporaries
in giving him 251 votes, but COWCStllH
Mr. Hughes only 228 anil regards the
others in seven states as doubtful.
MB of the national chairmen ex
press the most sincere confidence tba!
the ultimate result will elect his can
didate. Uomunl- Almost I in liable
With the contest narrowing stctidi'y
to close votes in the vital spots, re
counts are almost inevitable and each
side is on the watch for irregularities
There is no assurance that the result
w ill be fully known in another day.
A summary of reports received by
the Associated Press nt 2 o'clock this
morning show the fifty-two doubtful
electoral votes leaning us follow :
Wilson California, 13; Idaho. I :
North Dakota, 5; Washington, 7; New
Mexico, 3. Total, M, Hughes -Minnesota.
12, ami West Virginia. 8. Total
20.
Should the results prove to be as in
dicated by those reports. Wilson would
riieie 272, the number claimed for
him by llie Western Headquarters Ol
1 the Democratic Committee at Chicago
and Hughes would receive Mft Thus
Wilson would buve bIx more than the
I the necessary 266, ami Hughes would
have seven loss than the number re
I iiiired for election.
