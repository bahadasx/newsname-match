The very close vote in Minnesota, California, Oregon, North Dakota, New Mexico and
West Virginia may turn the election to either party.
Baltimore Sun today gives Mr. Wilson’s Electoral Vote as 251, and Mr. Hughes as 229; and the Baltimore American gives
Mr. Wilson 251 and Mr. Hughes 252. Minnesota has 12 votes, New Mexico 3, California 13, Oregon 5, West
Virginia 8, and these States will decide who will be elected president.
The vote in Maryland for Wilson was 134,216; Hughes 113,695; Lewis 108,134; France 111,585, Dry 58,380; Wet 27,872.
Baltimore City majority against prohibition was 21,540. Prohibition was an issue in eight states. The drys won with

Surely Something Wrong.
“Did you get anything unusual out
of that prlma donna?” asked the city
editor,
"An extraordinary person," said the
reporter. "She declared that her rival,
Mine. Topknote, In ‘Boheme’ last night,
Is the best ‘Mind’ she has ever heard
sing the role, and that the tenor In
tonight’s bill Is a perfect gentleman.”
“Give us about a column of that stuff
for the first page,” advised the city ed
itor, “and hang round hack of the
scenes for the rest of the engagement.
There must be something wrong with
that opera company."
Cork Tree.
The cork tree 1k n species of oak.
In Spain the outer bark Is harvested
from the same tree once every nine or
ten years. The best cork comes from
trees that are fifty to one hundred
years old. Instead of Injuring the
tree, stripping the hark seems to add
impetus to the growth of a new coat.
The yield of a tree varies from fifty
pounds to five hundred. What Is
known us the "cork-bark elm” In some
sections Is also called (he “witch elm"
In some parts of Canada, from the
weird and ghastly appearance of Its
boughs and trunk. Although some
what similar In appearance to the cork
oak, It has not the slightest value for
Its bark.

Best Disinfectant Known.
A physician writes to Farm anc,
Fireside saying: “That ihe very best
disinfectant known to science does not
seem to be known to some people at
all.
“I allude to boric acid, or, as some
people call It, horaclc acid. It Is ex
ceedingly elllcient, safe and economi
cal. It is a white powder, and makes
the best dressing for wounds that mod
ern doctors have ever discovered. In
using peroxide of hydrogen It is al
ways necessary to remember that
while It Is a disinfectant It Is not a
healing remedy at all, as It Is acid in
reaction and stimulating, rather than
healing, to wounds. Doric acid Is
mild and safe in Its action, promotes
rapid healing of wounds, can be used
as a dressing powder or, dissolved in
water, as a cleanslhg solution. Doric
acid in solution makes an excellent
gargle for sore throats or a lotion for
sore eyes, and as it is not at all expen
sive a pound box of it, should form
part of the domestic supplies of every
family. Always remember that boric
acid is nonpoisonous In any ordinary
quantity usually used, while bichloride
of mercury and carbolic acid are ex
ceedingly poisonous. For disinfecting
and deodorizing drains, the crude or
unrefined carbolic acid is one of the
best agents obtainable."

THEY DROP MIDDLE NAMES
Some Extremely Nice Persons Have
Only Two Names, Is Discovery
Recently Made.
“This Is the day of tire two-cylindei
name, which fact has been proved hy
cognomen connoisseurs who have
looked over every name at Harvard
and Inspected the persons to whom the
names belong. They learned that some
extremely nice persons have no middle
names at all and seem to get on rather
well without them.
“It Is assumed," says a New York
Herald writer, “that the ever-growing
trend toward efficiency Is to he blamed
for the dropping of oversize names, for
It has long been understood that a per
son with a two-ply (itle need not be
especially embarrassed about it. In
the course of a wealthy man’s life It
means the writing of about 10.000.00U
useless words If he uses his middle
name on checks and Indorsements, and
these things have got to be considered.
“The Porcelain club at Harvard, the
most exclusive organization of its kind
In the country, proves this year the
failing value of middle names. There
are 15 members this year and but five
of them are burdened with excessive
nomenclature.”
Character In Handwriting.
Half the business and professional
men you meet have a fad* That of Wil
liam Copeland Kucher, (he architect
and ex-presldent of the Business Sci
ence club, Is reading character by
means of penmanship, a writer In the
Philadelphia Public Ledger declares.
“I am taught by the best experts,”
he said to me, “(hat they can without
difficulty tell a crook from an honest
person by handwriting. Character or
lack of It Is easy to detect upon the
written page.
“But What no expert can yet do Is
to distinguish a dull man from a smart
one by the style of ids penmanship.”
“The greatest scholar I ever knew
personally wrote a decidedly Inferior
hand. An examination of the penman
ship of American presidents will reveal
something of the same thing.
“There was no better writer than
James K. Polk, who put flourishes on
his own signature, but his bravery was
distinctly inferior to that of ‘Geo.
Washington' or ‘A. Lincoln,’ as they
signed themselves, In a cramped, medi
ocre hand.
“John Adams wrote the clearest and
in very plain letters. Madison had a
fine, effeminate style, while that of
B. B. Hayes resembled more nearly the
writing of a business man than did
that of any other president.
Sculptor's Prophecy.
Suddenly, In (he midst of his work,
Arnold Konneheck, who was designing
the decorations for municipal bridges
in Berlin, was overwhelmed hy a
strange and unaccountable feeling of
sadness. It was not like a mood, hut
rather like a deep shadow cast over
him and ids work. He was under con
tract to do the work, hut he could not
keep at it. Finally lie yielded to what
was for him a mysterious impulse, and
let his feelings have their way with
him. No one was more astonished
than he win n he had finished, roughly
but with simple power, n figure of the
crucified Christ and the mourning
women.
lie could not explain it. He wrote
to a friend: “I felt i had to do it. I
could find no other symbol to express
my sense of tragedy. But as soon as
It was done I felt relief, and I am
working again.”
Did the war fling the shadow of the
cross over the sensitive soul of the
artist, and was his mood born of the
inner knowledge that (here was to ho
another crucifixion, and that again
throughout the world there would be
women mourning at the foot of the
cross upon which humanity was bleed
ing?— Christian Herald.

When Cows Sold at sls.
ITow the Increase In the coat of liv
ing has progressed in the last thirty
or forty years was discussed hy Gov.
J. B. Kendrick of Wyoming, an old
stockman, who has watched the march
of events. Today a chicken is worth
more than a turkey was a few years
ago; a turkey more than a hog: a hog
more than a cow used to be worth, and
a cow more than a horse. This Illus
trates the Increase in the price of
food stock.
“In March, 1870, I went down to
Texas to look over two thousand head
of steers in Matagorda county, south
ern Texas,” Governor Kendrick said,
according to the Washington Post.
“While I was down looking over the
young cattle I was asked by the man
ager of the ranch if I cured to buy
some older steers. The owner, I was
told, had a number of six-year-old
steers that he would sell, although ho
was not anxious. He was going to
hold them until he got bis price, he
declared. The manager Impressed
upon me, however, that I need not
hope to buy unless I was willing to
pay the owner’s price.
“I asked the price, and was told
that he wanted fifteen dollars a head.
Think of It—fifteen dollars a head for
six-year-olds, and today calves are
bringing eighty-five dollars,”
