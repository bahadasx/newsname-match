INDICATES WILSON'S ELECTION
By United Press. .
New York, Nov. 9., (3:4a p. m.) The
tide for Wilson has set in so strong In
California and Minnesota that it ap
peared probable at 3:45 that returns
from these would Indicate the presi
dent's re-election. This belief is based
on the fact that Hughes must carry
both states to win. Wilson is main
taining his California lead and is cut
ting Hughes' Minnesota Ifad.
CELEBRATE
WILSON'S
NEW LEAD
Democrats Engage in Demonstration
Learning" that Wilson Took Lead
in California
NATIONAL
SUFFRAGE
SCHOOL
Institution to Be Established in Baltimore
Will Instruct Suffragists Along
Historic! Lines
The turning of the tide in California
last night w hich sent the Golden State
toward the Wilson column where it
stilt remains, was tho signal for a
spontaneous demonstration on the part
of Chickasha Democrats who scented
victory for their leader in the spec
tacular and long to be remembered
race which has just been run.
With the repeated shrieking of the
slreu, which blew too long and often
to serve as a fire ab many people
hurried from their homes to town to
join the throngs which at that hour
were issuing from the two picture
i shows and Rome was made as merry
as several hundred husky Democrats
could make it with the police force
hidden out. Rome was theirs and they
made it howl, Innocently enough ex
cept for a suggestion at one time that
violence be done to the expected issue
of the Daily Oklahoman which would
arrive on a later train. Cool heads
prevailed, however, and no untoward
action was taken.
A compromise was effected by build'
ing a bonfire in the streets at the cor
ner of Chickasha and Fourth and cast
ing therein those copies of tho Okla
homa City paper that happened to be
in the possession of the enthusiastic
protestants.
This outburst was the outcome of
the publication by the Daily Oklaho
man of the photograph, of Hughes as
winner and by the concession of the
election of the Republican candidate
for tlie presidency at the early hour
on Tuesday evening when that paper
went to press.
This followed action taken by sever
al hundred persons yesterday after
noon who signed a declaration of dis
approval of this act.
Guns and every other conceivable
noise added to the deafening roar of
the celebration nd speeches were
made from their cars by Oscar Simp
son, successful candidate for county
attorney, Rev. L. L. Cohen, Jr., of the
Epworth Methodist church, and oth
ers, which wero loudly cheered.
Among tho speakers was Mart Lou
than, captain of the capitol police at
Washington, who was the first sheriff
of Grady county.
The demonstration continued until
well into the night and the demon
strators retired strong in the convic
tion that their man had been elected.
"The Republicans can do the same
thing if by any chance Hughes is elect
ed," said Mayor Coffmau in reply to
a suggestion that the opposite side
might not have ben given the privi
lege of the city. ''There is- only this
different'.'," continued the mayor. "I
told the Democrats to go ahead and I
would join them but I would not do
this on hearing that Hughes was in
the lead."
When questioned as o the report
i that Mayor Coff man's vote had been
challenged on election day he said he
could not understand how such a re
port had gained currency. "If the
judges had sopn me during the cele
bration last nislit they might have
thought I was a kid and cut me out
on that account," he explained.
EXPERIENCED WORKERS
TO PUT THEM THROUGH
Street Meeting Will Be Conducted From
Decorated Automobile and Hecklers

8y United Press.
New York, Nov. 9. A national

State Woman Suffrage party, and Mrs.
Rose Geyer of Iowa.
These experienced suffrage workers
will put the pupils through their paces

paign methods, and will not only teach
lessons and give rules, but will also
demonstrate their tactics with model
debates, street meetings and other
concrete forms of suffrage activity.
The street meeting will be conducted
from a decorated automobile and with
its surrounding crowd and hecklers
will run true to the form of the aver
ago suffrage meeting in the street.

frage campaigner in the United States,

Wight Jones Says Peanuts Can Be Grown

That raising peanuts pays is the pos
itive statement of Wight Jones, a far
mer living near Naples, who has just
gathered a crop on forty acres averag
ing thirty bushels to the acre which he
sold today for one dollar a bushel to
the Oklahoma Fruit and Melon asso
ciation. Mr. Jones claims that peanuts can
be grown on poor land with a certain

Thoso automobile owners who are
waiting for the repeal of the ordinance
requiring a driver's license at $1 per
and the examination of such drivers
by -a competent board, are likely to
find themselves brought up Into po
lice court on November 16 and forced
to pay a fine for driving without such
license. If the ordinance is repealed
before the date it will have to be done
at tho 'regulur session tonight, which
is not probable, a'.'.Uoi'gh Mayer Corf
man has started an investigation to
ascertain whether or not drivers are
charged for licenses iu other cities.
The only place heard from thus far Is
Oklahoma City where the city clerk
stales that every driver Is obliged to
have a license for which he pays $1.
Should he lose this license, he must
pay 25 cents for another.
"I am of the opinion that this is the
ease in nearly every city in Oklaho
ma," said the mayor. "We do not
want to take tho people's money un
necessarily and if this is against the
state law the ordinance will be repeal
ed and all that has been paid in since
the law became effective will be re
funded. In the meantime, however,
the law will be vigorously enforced
and those failing to get licenses by
November ,- will bo subject to arrest
and a fine."
The circulation of the report of a
probable repeal of this law has had
its effoct on applications for license.
It is estimated that between 200 and
300 drivers of legal age are now driv
ing without the necessary documents.
Up to date, including the register for
several years back, a total of 438 li
censes have been issued. This in
eludes about sixty which have been I
paid for since the ordinance was re
vived two weeks ago, up to which time
about 373 had been issued.
Since a week ago Thursday one hur.
dred applications for licenses have
been bade but of these forty-two are
still out.
Vincent Box Still Out; County Election
Board Busy With Canvass of
Retmns
With the Vincent precinct box still
out, It was evident this morning that
Woodrow Wilson had carried Grady
county by a plurality of approximately
1SO0 votes, the largest vote that tho
Democratic ticket has received since
the statehood election. In 40 of the
41 precincts of the county the total
Wilson vote wa.s 1792, Hughes 1295,
and Benson Vincent precinct
registered 12 Democrats, 10 Republi
cans and 17 Socialists and it is likely
that the vote fell but little behind
these figures.
Forty precSnctsavc Oscar Simpson,
Democrat, for county attorney 2692
votes; Clark, Republican, 1691," and
Searcy, Socialist, 847, making Simp
son's plurality over Clark 1001.
In 32 precincts the vote on the. So
cialist election laws was as follows:
For the "fair election law," lft&ti..
against 1081; for the repeal of the reg
istration law 129, agtaiist 2013.
The total Socialist vote falls about
41.M.1 behind their vote in the last elec
tion while the Republicans have about
held their own.
All of the foregoing figures, wit'a
the precinct returns that follow, are
unoficial and therefore subject to
correction. The county election board
began to canvass the returns yester
day and will not finish till some time
tomorrow. The board is composed of
Dr. J. M. Hanna, Alex, chairman; S.
C. Ditrbin, Chickasha. secretary, and
H. M. Canan. Porasset, C. B. March
and A. Halght are serving as clerks
to the board.
