these sets would make any cos

The muffs are twentyfour in-

sees seem to prefer separate sets
of fur that can be worn with va
rious gowns in the wardrobe, and
that lend a distinction to the toi
let which the cheaper grade furs
lack. One notice a demand for
suits and coats of fine materials
without any fur in their garni
tures, though practically every
one in street dress wears fur to
the limit.

A cold does not get well of it

a cold wears you out, and your
cough becomes serious if neg
lected. Hacking coughs drain
the energy and sap the vitality.
