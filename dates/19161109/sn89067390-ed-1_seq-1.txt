NEWS OF THE ELECTION
Returns Being Received from tle Various States Indicate
a Remarkably Close Contest in the Electoral
ColleSe West Stands by Wilson.
NEW YORK GIVES HUGHES LARGE MAJORITY
Republicans Also Carry Illinois. Indiana and Michigan With
Votes tc Spare Democrats Lose New Jersey Minne
sota and California Show Close Vote.
California and Minnesota will de
cide whither President Wilson will
continue in office or give way to
Charles K. Hughes, in California
Hughes, with the vote half in, leads
by about ln.iHiO. In Minnesota Wilson
has approximately the same lead, but
is losing it as the rural vote comes in.
Prank H. Kellogg, Republican state
chairman in Minnesota, says Hughes
will carry the state by f;,onO. The
Minneapolis Journal claims the state
for Hughes by 10, mi to 2u,ono. Rural
returns tend to bear out these pre
dictions. O. K. Cushion, Democratic state
chairman, says count continues to In
crease confidence that Wilson has car
ried the state. If Hughes carri s Cali
fornia and Minnesota and holds other
close states that now appear safely
his, he will have won.
Utah, one of the two states which
gave their electoral votes to Taft In
1912. turned upside down and wenr
for Wilson.
The President also scenm sure of
Nevada and had a slight lead In
Washington early this morning.
McCormiek Claims 270 for Wilson.
New York. Nov. 8 Vance McCor
mlrlc, chairman of the Democratic
national committee, at midnight
claimed the election of President
Wilson with 270 votes In the electoral
college.
"Our report received up to mid
night," Chairman McCormiek said,
showed that the. President had re
ceived certainly 270 electoral votes,
not Including Massachusetts and
Connecticut or California or other
Far Western states yet to be heard
from."
1'p to 12:30 o'clock, Mr. McCormiek
had declined to give out a list of the
states upon which he claimed 270
electoral votes for President Wilson.
Claims 370 as Hughes' Total.
New York, Nov. S While refusing
to make formal statements embody
ing electoral votes claimed by the
Rep bllcans W. H. Wlllcox, chairman
of the Republican national committee,
said he w'as satisfied Mr. Hughes
would be elected. Mr. Hughes, he
said would probably have In the
neighborhood of 210 electoral votes.
Mr. Willcox said that he would
sometime toward morning make a
statement when there was no doubt
of the figures In hand.
When shown the list of states
claimed by the Republican national
committee. Robert W. Woolley, direc
tor of publicity of the Democratic
national committee, said that the
claim of the Republicans was without
foundation.
Soon after midnight the Republican
national committee, In an official
statement, claimed California, Con
necticut, Delaware, Idaho, Illinois, In
diana, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massa
chusetts, Michigan, New Hampshire,
New Jersey, New York, North Dakota,
Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island,
South Dakota, Vermont, Washington,
West Vir.ri'iia and Wisconsin. That
made a total of 284 electoral votes,
eighteen im re than the necessary 266
for an elect inrt.
This was the of'ieiul indication from
the Republicans that the result would
be so close.
New York for Hughes by 100,000.
The Republican managers realized
that a sudden switch nIn thegtatei
incomplete or unheard from might "in
crease the Wilson figures, but were
'sure the later figures would add to
the states they were claiming.
The state of New York has been
carried for Hughes by a plurality of
more than one hundred thousand.
The indications are that he also has
carried Illinois by a like plurality.
Ohio Is In Doubt.
Tho returns from Ohio are insuffl-
cient to determine the result in that
state.
All of the Now England states and
New Jersoy, as well as Wisconsin and
Michigan, rave been removed from the
list of doubtful states. They have
gone for Hl'gl es.
Unless there is a landslide for
rrestdnt Wilson on the Pacific slope,
the election of Hughes seems certain.
Illinois Big for Hughes.
Chicago, Nov. 8. Two thousand six
hundred and eight of fi.3C9 precincts
in Illinois, including 1,525 Chicago pre
cincts, give Wilson U2,71C; Hughes
498,425.
Returns received up to 9:1") o'clock
last night indicated a Republican vic
tory in Illinois by a plurality esti
mated by Republicans at more than
ono hundred thousand for Charles
Evans l.'ughes and slightly smaller
pluralities for the Republican state
ticket, headed by Frank O. Lowden
for governor.
Estimates based on returns up to
that hour indicated a plurality for
Hughes in the state outside of Chi
cago of more than one hundred thou
sand, while Hughes was leading slight
ly on Incomplete Ch'cago returns. The
race In Chicago, however, was close.
Lowden was opposed by Gov. Ed
ward F. Dunne, Democrat, who was
up for reelection.
Governor Dunne tonight conceded
his d fcit in a telegram of congratu
'it ions to his Re uhlican opponent.
The vote was heavy throughout the
state. In Chicago it was estimated at
more than 90 per cent of the registra
tion. Wc -ien, who voted for the first time
In Illinois on the presidential is'1!

WILSON WON IN OKLAHOMA.
Oklahoma City, Nov. 8. With about
one-seventh of the total precincts In
the state heard from, President Wil
son was leading Hughes In Oklahoma
by ten thousand votes. Returns were
coming In very slowly, but It Is as
serted by Democratic leaders the pre
cincts to be heard from will lower
Wilson ? plurality.
Republicans in Oklahoma aro show.
Ing remarkable strength. Bert Chand
ler is running ahead of James Daven
port for Congress In the First District
and It is almost a certainty ho will be
elected with considerable majority.
All other congressmen, early returns
Indicate, have been re-elected. State
officers will be equally divided be
tween tho Democrats and Republi
cans, according to the returns thus
far received. In the Indian country
the vote was decidedly Republican,
the Indians voting against Wilson.
Oklahoma City went Democratic,
although by a considerably smaller
majority than heretofore. Republi
can candidates for city and county
offices are claiming election over
their Democratic rivals. The Social
ist election law amendment was de
feated by a considerable majority, ac
cording to returns nqwat hand.
Concede Hughes Michigan,
1 etroit, Mich., Nov. 8. Democratic
leaders, shortly before midnight to
nic';!, practically conceded that
Hughes would carry Michigan. Re
turns from 215 precincts, or ahou'
one-tenth of the state, gave Hughes
:!2.olS and Wilson 27.il2.
Tammany Falls Down.
New York, Nov. 8. With l.nr.C dis
torts missing out of fi.8n" in New
York state. Charles K. Hughes led
President Wilson in the presidential
contest at lit o'clock tonight with a
plurality of Ci,lfi2.
Wilson's lead In Greater New York,
with ot.ly ninety-seven districts miss
ing, was :!9,:!;,", while Hughes led up
state by 101,177, with l.l.'.U districts
still to be heard from.
Wilson carried Manhattan by a
plurality of 27."0.
The Democrats made gains In
several industrial cities upstate, but
th country dktricts remained over
whelmingly Republican.
The most notable increase in the
Democratic vote was in Buffalo,
second largest city in the state,
which Hughes carried by only :i,t'.:;7,
although it was carried by Whitman
for governor two years ago by more
than 19.000.
Slight Democratic gains also were
.shown in Rochester, Syracuse and Al
bany, the banner Republican cities of
the state. '
From returns received at 10 o'clock
it was apparent thatt Charles S. Whit-
man had been reelected governor
over Samuel Seabury, his Democratic
opponent.
States with big electoral votes, such
as New York, Pennsylvania, Massa
chusetts, Illinois and Iudiuna, early
were put into the Hughes column.
South Still Solid.
Atlanta, Ga Nov. 8. President
Wilson was given tho usual substan- ;
tial Democratic majorities in today's '
election in the southern slates of Vir
ginia, North and South Carolina, Geor
gia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi,
Tennessee, Arkansas, Louisiana and
Texas. j
Tho Democrats gained at least one
seat in Congress in tho defeat of
James J. Pritt, 'Republican, for re
election from tho Tenth North Caro
lina District by Zcbulon Weaver, Dem
ocrat. The North Carolina dclega- j
tion thua becomes once more wholly i
Democratic. Early returns from Vir
ginia indicated that the Democrats
had retained the nine seats they al
ready hold, but that Congressman C.
H. Slemp was re-elected In the Ninth
PistiVt, which is normally Republi
can. The result, in the two close dis
tricts in Tennessee and one in Louisi
ana, which now has a Progressive
congressman, was still In doubt.

DRYS CARRY FOUR STATES
Statewide Prohibition Wins, In South
Dakota, Michigan and Nebraska
Wets Keep Missouri.
Kansas City, Nov. 8. Reports up to
midnight indicated that three of the
seven states toting direct yesterday
on prohibition amendments had deliv
ered a knockout blow to "booze" by
voting "dry" amendments by substan
tial majorities. These Btatcs were
South Dakota, Michigan and Nebraska.

i
! Amendment was ib fc.tted in Missouri
by a small majority. A statement
from "wet" headquarters placed no
definite majority, but declared the
amendment bad lost.
California probably voted down the
submitted prohibition amendment, al-
. though early returns were meager.
There was also a dearth of figures in
'Montana., where prohibition was an
issue. Maryland v ill probably remain
in the "wet" column, the majority be
ing estimated at forty thousand.
Arkansas was saved to the ranks of
tho prohibition states by the indicated
defeat of the law substituting local
option for the present statewide pro
hibition. Returns were received first
from the cities where it was expected
there would be a "wet" plurality, and
the failure of claims of the liquor in
terests there indicated that the vote
in the rest of the slate would be to
ret. iin prohibition.
In the states from which early re
turns were received the "dry" vote
was overwhelming. On the ratio of
the early return Smith Dakota went
Into the "dry" column by twenty thou
sand. The majoii'v for prohibition in
Nebraska was estimated at "o.nim.
No early returns were received from
Oregon, Colorado, Washington and
Arizona, where the "wets" were striv
ing to weaken the prohibitory laws by
"beer" amendments.
