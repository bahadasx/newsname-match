The election was a quite affair so
tar as Heppner was concerned, but
the election crowds were large, es
pecially in the evening. At places

streets presented an extra lively ap
pearance. COUNTY COURT PROCEEDINGS

VOTE FOR PRESIDENT IS CLOSE
FINAL RESULT IS YET IN
TURNS FROM MINNESOTA GIVE HUGHES LEAD
THERE OREGON WON BY HUGHES BY 4000.
The vote for President of the Unl
d States is developing into the
closest- contest in years and the sec
ond day after the election the result
still hangs in the balance. One
thing is certain, whether President
Wilson or Mr. Hughes Is victorious,
the winner will not have a wide mar
gin of electoral votes.
Minnessota, which was at first con
ceded to the Democrats, gave Hughes
a margin of 1000 after the last vote
had been counted. The race was so
close that a re-count has been ordered
there. This is the substance of a re
port that reached Heppner this morn
ing, although it has not yet been ver
ified. Minnesota has 12 electoral
votes.
California, Is another state which
hangs in the balance. It is claimed
by both sides. - Hiram Johnson, re
publican, running for United States
senator, carried the state by 200,000,
according to the estimates made from
present indications. With this as a
criterion, Hughes should prove the
W. R. C. HAS GREAT
The Woman's Relief Corps is the
only auxiliary of the Grand Army of
the Republic. Its alms and achieve
ments are so well known now that but
a brief sketch is needful at this time.
In the year 1869 the first Corps
was organized at Portland, Maine, as
an auxiliary to the first Post of the
p. A. R.
. Nearly ten years later Massachu
setts and Ohio organized into the re
lief work, Massachusetts took the
name of the Portland society and
Ohio that of "Post Ladies' Aid So
ciety." The National Woman's Relief Corps
was organized at Denver, in 1883,
and the work and ritual of the Mas
sachusetts society were adopted.
Since that time the order has gone
steadily forward and each year has
seen a great amount of chartiable
and relief work accomplished. The
business of the order has been reduc
ed to a system which is a marvel of
simplicity .and accuracy.
Although the demands upon the
order for assistance are not as numer
us, nor as urgent as during the twenty-five
years following the war, there
still are many opportunities for every
loyal woman to lend a helping hand
or give a word of cheer to the Union
veterans, the boys who wore the blue.
This is purely a labor of love on
the part of the members of this or
der whose hearts are fired with love
for our country and devotion to our
,flag, and who deem it high honor to
minister to those whose heroism has
given us re-united country and a
i flag whose galxy of stars is com
i plete.
This order gladly welcomes every
I loyal woman "who has not given aid
r comfort to the enemies of the "Uni
on,"whether she is a blood relative
of a Comrade or not. In pursuance
of this thought I would like to quote
j briefly from an address of our first
National President, E. Florence Bar
ker as follows: "What shall we do
with the maiden through whose veins
coursed the same proud blood, In
whose heart was the same love of
freedom as in her manly lover's, who,
iwlh white Hps and almost breaking
heart, folded away the wedding gar
ments, making her sacrifice In the sil
ent chamber, while she prayed for
strength to go forth to bid her all
good bye, and charge him to remem
ber her prayers were following, amid
shot and shell, the bravest soldier in
the land. So did she impart strength
to him, making him a better soldier,
a truer man. It was a comrade's du
ty to return to the maiden her mes
sages of love, and tell her of the bul
let's fatal work. And now, when so
purified as by fire, she comes -to our
doors, asking leave to work for her
lover's comrades, shall we say, 'Stand
aside, we have only honors enough to
extend to the wives, mothers, sisters
and daughters of our heroes, and un
less ranked among those, you cannot
work under our banner?"
'Remember woman Is loyal by birth
not by marriage.'
During these later years much ot
the work of the order has been along
lines of patriotic education. It Is
DOUBT, ALTHOUGH RE
.
winner. However, Republican lead
ers say that Mr. Hughes does not need
California to win.
Oregon has given Mr. Hughes a safe
margin of 4000 votes If reports com
ing from Portland are to be relied up
on. It was freely predicted before
the election that Wilson would carry
Portland strongly, but final reports
have delivered Oregon's metropolis
Into the Hughes colums. Willamette
Valley counties also went strong for
Hughes.
In Morrow county with 16 out of
7 precincts complete and tho vote for
resident definitely known, President
Wilson has carried the county by ap
proximately 80 votes. The final re
sult being Hughes 709 and Wilson
780. Normally, this county is repub
lican by 400. The heavy Wilson vote
here Is attributed to the Women vo
ters. Ia the vote at large, the big eastern
tates were early conceded to Hughes,
New' York, Illinois, Indiana, Wiscon
sin, Michigan, Pennsylvania and the
New England States giving the Re
publican nominee a heavy vote.
Heppner High School outplayed
their opponents, the lone high school
football team In their second game
of the season at lone last Tuesday,
ut the lone boys were not out-scored.
The final result stood 13 to 3 for the
Egg City warriors.
Heppner's three points were scored
arly In the game after they had rush-
eu iae umit apwo me neia oy a series
of end rata and line plunges. After
getting within striking distance of
the goal and being unable to make
yardage, quarterback Nickolson call
ed for a place kick. He booted the
ball fairly between the posts. Nick
j olson tried for goal from placement
on two occasions but was unsuccess
ful. The outstanding feature of the
game was the line plunging by Blake
ot lone and Hughes ot Heppner.
Neither side seemed to be able to stop
these charges short of 8 or 10 yards
once they got started. Heppner gain-
d more yardage throughout the game
and made more first downs than their
opponents but liked the punch at the
proper time to shove the ball over for
! a touchdown. Two of Ione's touch-
downs were made by line plunging
tactics and fluke fumble on the part
of Heppner. Howell recovered the
. umble and got away tor a touchdown.
I It was by far the best game be
tween the two schools in several
years and both teams displayed team
work that shows they have been re
ceiving some good coaching.
Th result of this game gives lone

Arthur R. Crawford of Heppner
was referee and Walter Cochran of
lone was umpire.
largely owing to the influence and
work of the Woman's Relief Corps,
hat today, the flag floats above nearly
every school house in our land. Al
so the order has been very active in
securing legislation to prevent de
secration of the flag, such as its use
for advertising purposes. Further
more, the order encourages in every
way possible the observance of Na
tional anniversaries and flag day.
In this department, which means
the State of Oregon, it is customary
to present a large flag to the High
School In the City where the annual
Convention is held. The presenta
tion takes place with beautiful and
appropriate ceremonies. It is truly
an inspiring sight, one to cause the
heart throbs to quicken and the eyes
to grow misty, as our flag, your flag,
my flag, the flag that makes us free,
slowly rises to the top of the staff
and flings its glorious colors to the
breeze, while the bands are playing
"The Star Spangled Banner."
The watchword of the Woman's
Relief Corps has ever been and will
ever be, "to assist the Grand Army
of the Republic in its noble work of
'caring for afflicted comrades and
their dependent ones." '
I Its Creed Is embodied on the thrill
ing words of our nation-wide salute
I to the flag. "I pledge allegiance to
my flag and to the Republic for which
lit stands. One nation, indivisible,
with liberty and Justice for all."

THE DRY MEASURE
Normal School Bill Wins County By
Narrow Margin-Full Rental Bill
Buried Under Deep and Single
Item Veto Carries In the
County.
Morrow County's vote on the re
erred measures and the initiated bills
hows strange results. Here Is a
county that voted 448 for and 651
against the negro suffrage amend
ment bill and then went right on
down the ballot and rolled up a vote
of 679 for and 668 against the Pend
leton Normal bill. This must signi
fy that we voters are ignorant and
know that we are Ignorant. Many
people have said since the election
that they did not understand the neg
ro suffrage bill and tor that reason
voted against It.
Another fact is evident. Morrow
county is growing more strongly In
favor of a. dry state each year. In
bygone days it was a nip and tuck
fight in this county between the wet
and dry forces. Tuesday the Brew
ers' bill was swept under by a de
cisive vote of 465 to 878. Reports
from the state at large Indicate that
the complete prohibition bill has
carried. This county voted 829 to
464 tor the prohibition measure.
It the result in Morrow county Is
a measure by which to Judge the vote
ot the state at large, U'Ren's Ren
tal Value Land Tax bill has gone
down with a crushing defeat. The
vote here on this measure stands 201
for to 839 against. It is the most
badly beaten measure on the ballot.

Mr. Knappenberg is entitled to credit
for his enterprise in placing one ot
these tractors on his lands. The
cost of plowing will be greatly re
duced and much more work can be ac
complished by fewer hands. We
hope the machine will prove a suc
cess as they can be generally adopted
for farm work.
