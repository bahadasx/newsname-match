"Whether it turns out in the final count that j
Wilson is elected or not —and no one hopes i j
I more strongly that he is than does The Times jj!
| —this has heen a significant election for this !■
j state and county. i
I IT HAS DEMONSTRATED THAT OUR
PEOPLE WILL NOT STAND FOR A
PUSSY-FOOTER
Tlie fact was manifested both by the vote
against Hughes and by the close vote on gov-
II ernor.
This is a republican ' state and district.
Hughes came to the Stadium and said nothing.
Mcßride allowed himself to he gagged (dur
ing this campaign only) by the reactionary
gang, and failed to take a stand on many im
portant issues.
The result? Wilson carried the county and
II the state, "safe republican" though they have HI
JJ been listed. Mcßride, expected by many dem- 111
I ncrats to romp away with the election, did
j nothing of the kind.
On the other hand, Senator Poindexter, in
spite of his support of Hughes which disap
j pointed many of his admirers, won easily.
I Why? He was candid. He did not hedge.
The people knew just where he stood.
| Governor Lister, who lias been negative on
important occasions in his administration,
saw the light—and made his campaign one of
frankness, even to the extent of admitting in
a manly way some of his mistakes. He thus j
II overcame a handicap of thousands of votes. lii
With this experience behind him he doubt
| less now will go into his second term a freer,
more intelligent, more independent and conse- I
quently a far better governor. |
I The county ring, from the first to the last of J
the campaign considered impregnable, saw
il Griffith, a democrat, come close to defeating 111
Longmire for sheriff. I
The vicious bills that the last legislature li
petted and which were referred to the people I
| are wiped off the earth. The backward-look- j
ing constitutional amendment is as dead as a |
last summer's dandelion. The booze bills are
vetoed by an unmistakable and uniform dry j
■sentiment. j
The Jimmy Davises and Guy Kellys thus |
have been sternly rebuked by the voters of '
a state. They and their fellow legislators j
[I ihould go to Olympia mouth after next with
I the moral in mind.
_Vnd another lesson is that your Tacoman or
your Washingtonian no longer is a partisan.
He is too big a man or woman to be catalogued
and pigeon-holed as a "democrat" or a "re- ;
publican." He is a free-minded, unbossed ii
voter, AND YOU, MR. OFFICEHOLDER j
ARE MERELY HIS EMPLOYE.

"WATCHFUL WAITING"
All. the Old Cripples Wait Their
Turn at Busy N. P. Car Hospital
By Mabel Abbott
Wherever, on Northern Pa
cific rails within a radius of
many miles around Tacoma,
you see a locomotive limping
along with a pain in its boil
er, or its fire-box in need of
dentistry, or rheuinitlc rat
tles in its driving-gear, or
with its cowcatcher smashed
or its headlight bunged up or
bearing other evidences of
disorderly conduct, that lo
< oin<etix« js probably going to
South Tacoma.
Likewise, any disabled passen
ger coaches, box and flat cars, ca
booses, snow plows, hand cars,
and any other rolling-stock you
may see hobbling along somewhat
the worse for wear, are also likely
to be on their way to South Ta
coma.
For in South Tacoma are the
Northern Pacific shops, the nig
gest establishment of their kind
in the Northwest; and there conw
all the old, ailing and Injured lo
comotives from four divisions of
the Northern Pacific railway, and
all the cars from more than two
divisions, to be made whole again
or put out of their misery.
The South Tacoma shops also
build new box cars, furnish and
dress all lumber used on the
whole Northern Pacific system,
and make forgings for more than
a third of the system. The works
will soon be enlarged by the ad
dition of a new reclaiming plant.
The shops and their serv
ice tracks occupy a mile
long strip of terltory, and
employ more than 1,000
men.
Tho October payroll w»s
almost 989,000.
These facta and figures show
something of the size and import
ance of the industry that his
made South Tacoma known
wherever Northern Pacific rails
are laid; but they convey no idea
of Its interest and plcturesque
ness.
To get the thrill of the busi
ness, one must step, as I did the
other day, into a building as long
as a city block, filled for its entire
length on one side with humming,
slapping, clicking, screeching,
wheels arid belts and maehln.-ry,
while along the other side, like
so many elephants in the "big
top" at a circus, stand 10 locomo
tives, with men swarming under
their bodies, among their dii\e
wbeels, into their boilers, operat
ing on them wilth wrenches and
aii -hammers, healing them with
steel plates and red-hot rivets, or
junking thorn us uncenceriiudly
as If they were wheelbarrows.
And then one must realize that
this is only one of many build
ings. There Is the boiler-ejinp,
whose din dominates everything
else ln the yards; the saw-mill
through which pass 1,500,1100 feet
of lumber every month; cur
shops of many kinds; the forging
shop, an inferno of fire, sparks
and white-hot iron; and many
others.
There is something appalling
about the place.
▲ man in overalls presses a le
ver and bites a rivet-hole through
a piece of steel 5-16 th of an inch
thick, as a conductor might punch
a transfer.
Another with a single motion
of his hand, directs an iron arm
that picks up a 625-pound car
wheel as If it were a spool of
thread.
A third, riding on the great
transfer-table, carries a sick ioco
motive to Its pit with less fuss
than a grocer's boy makes in de
livering a package of crackers.
It is human strength mul
tiplied hy 1111 mi 11 brains into
inhuman power; natural
forces shanghaied and chain
ed into unnatural submis
sion; a welter of blind mon
sters incredibly obeying their
puny (rcaitor-si.
At least, that is what it looked
like to me.
I am quite sure it doesn't look
that way to Supt. F W. Malott,
at his desk ln the office from
which all the work of the shops
is directed. He has the whole
thing reduced to sheets of sta
tistics, columns of figures and
bales ot reports.
He told me that three of the lo
comotives I had seen had come
all the way from Montana; and
that the lumber yards held 18,
--000,000 o,- 20,000,000 feet of,
, lumber; and he showed me a pic-
I ture of the rolling-mill that will
' be installed as part of the new re
- claiming plant—a terrible affair
r of cylinders and cogs and jaws
- and teeth.
"That'll take a piece of
I iron and chop it up mil turn
1 it out in sbupe so we can use
r it again," he explained, ill
1' most caressing tlie picture in
Ills affection for its effi
t ciency.
Ilul hk for me, I went
1 home and had a nightmare,
' in which I whh chased by .1
1 hungry rolling-mill down an
1 endless vista of shrieking*,
1* snatching machinery.

XK\V YORK, Nov. l». —
President Wilson Is within
10 electoral vote*, of re-elec
tion.
Charles K. Ilm-1,... must
gain 2.'< If he is lo obtain n
majority.
This was the outstanding fea
ture of the progress of ihe vote
count today at noon.
With 2e"i(i votes in the electoral
college indicated for Wilson in
I'nlted Press returns, California
alone —or Minnesota alone -
would be sufficient to make Wil
son the 29th president of Ihe
Unit**. States.
Hughes, on the other hand, to
win, must carry both of these
I states.
As if further lo dr-ig out the
agony of apprehension among
politicians, California exhibited a
strong Wilson tendency und Min
nesota a Hughes drift.
President Wilson again
made --Keeping gains in Call
| liii-iiia as the count progress
ed there today. Last night's
canvass hud cut down his
I lead.
Up until this afternoon Hugh'".
■till maintained a lead in Minne-j
sota, the second of the doubtful
states he must carry If he is tc
receive the necessury 266 elec
toral votes.
California's jump came in a
single hour. At the start Wilson
was leading by only 641 votes in
5,399 out of li.n 17 "precincts. One
hour later, when a mistake had
been discovered in Mendocino
county and H:i new precincts had
reported, the 641 lead was
changed into 4,.'196.
Democrats were jubilant over
returns from San Olego county—
on the border, where Hughes was
expected to show his greatest
sticngth—which with only four
small precincts missing, gave the
republican candidate a plurality
of 205 votes.
At 11 o'clock Candidate
Hughes, accompanied by his wife,
, left for an automobile drive
\ through the city, not expecting to
, return until eariy afternoon.
