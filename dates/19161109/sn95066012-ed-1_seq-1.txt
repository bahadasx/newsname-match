IN FIVE STATES

Mican, Montana, South Dakota,

MISSOURI CONTINUES MOIST
Big "Wet" Vote in St. Louis Defeated
Proposition by More Than
Three to One.
Cincinnati. O., Nov. !. Headquart
ers of the antisaloou league in Ohio
yesterday reported it hud Information
that the dry forces hud won state
wide prohibition fights in five states
at Tuesday's election. The states
named were Michigan, Montana,
South Dakota, Utah and Nebraska.
Michigan, it Is estimated, went dry by
80,000. With the addition of these
states, antisaloon league otlieialH
stated that 24 states, one-half the un
ion, are now in the dry column.
The overwhelming "nay" vote in
St. Louis apparently defeated the
state-wide prohibition proposition in
Missouri by more than three to one.
With the total vote of St. Louis und
Kansas City reported und few rural
votes in, the count was 49,561 for and
173,785 against prohibition. St. Louis
voted 13, 272 for the proposition and
1-10,000 against. Kansas City, which
five years ago gave a majority of al
most three to one against the proposi
Hon, this year voted 31,000 for and
30,000 against.
A tremendous vote in San Francis
co tipped the beam early last nteht
against state amendment No. 2 im
posing rigid restrictions on the sule
and use of alcoholics. There had been
a good majority for the proposition
all day. The San Francisco majority
ugainst the amendment at 5 p. m. was
5;,j"89, which led according to former
figures by only 20.0G5. Amendment
No. 1, for complete prohibition ha3 not
seemed at any time to be a winner.
WOMAN CONGRESSMAN
Miss Jeannette Rankin Elected
in
Minnesota.
New York. Nov. 9. While Republi
can and Democratic women stayed
closely about, the national headquart
ers of the two parties as returns
slowly filtered in. the Suffragists
gathered yesterday to rejoice over a
State, by till indications, won, and the
election of a woman Congressman.
The new patch on tlie Suffrage map
in South Dakota, which, through offi
cial returns and private advices, is
said to have promised its women the
vote by a handsome majority. This is
the fifth timo the question has been
submitted to South Dakota. The vic
tory will give t'.ie women five more
electoral votes.
Miss Jeannette Rankin of Montana,
the woman Congressman, is a source
of particular pride to the National
Suffrage Association, Inasmuch as she
was for a number of years one of its
most valued organizers and the stan
ard bearer who carried her State for
Suffrage.

Tacoma, Wash., Nov. 8. There
appears to be a possibility that, al
though President Wilson carried
Washington Hughes may get ono of
tho seven electoral votes of the State.
The death of A. Stream, a Demo
cratic elector, shortly before election
and the substitution of E. M. Connor
as elector came so late that in many
counties the name of Stream rather
than Connor appeared on the ballot.
It Is said that many voted for
Stream and that these votes will be
invalid. The difference, according to
local Republicans, will be sufficient to
give one Kcpuhllcnn elector a plur

LOSE
LOP HOUSE
OF CONGRESS
Control of Senate May Be Reduced
to Margin of Eight
INDEPENDENTS A BIG FACTOR
Progressive, Independent, Socialist
and Socialist- Democrats Represent
atives May Hold Balance of Power
New York, Nov. 9. The Democrats
will retain control of ttie United
States Senate by a majority of not
more than twelve In the Sixty-fifth
Congress, according to late returns
last night. It may be reduced to
eleven.
Revised figures indicated that the
Republicans may take control of the
House of Representatives, but by a
very uncertain majority. They prob
ably will have six more seats than
the Democrats, but there will be six
representatives classified as Progress
ive. Independent, Socialist and Socialist-Democrat.
The last will be
George R. Lunn, former Mayor of
Schenectady, a Socialist who was In
dorseil by the Democrats.
These miscellaneous representa
tives will hold the balance of power,
unless the RepuWleans pick up
enough additional seats in districts
that are still doubtful to give them
a majority over all others.
The Republicans still hoped last
night to carry the Senatorial contests
In New Maxlco and Arizona which
remained In dou.bt. Victories for
them ther would cut the present
Democratic majority of sixteen to
eight.
The Democrats lost four senators,
one each In Maine, New York, New
Jersey and Maryland, while they
gained one each in Rhode Island, Del
aware and Utah.
Late returns showed a Republican
net gain in the House of 14 seats,
overturning the present Democratic
Had of 23, and making the Republican
majority taking the miscellaneous
representatives into consideration
six.
Among the most surprising results
were the election of Peter Goelt
Gerry, Democrat, over Senator Henry
F. Lippltt, Hip Rhode Island; the elec
tion of the Republican candidate for
Senator, Dr. J. 1. France, in Mary
land, and the defeat of Senator Du
liont. In Delaware by J. (). Wolcott.
Democrat.
Domocrais still hop for the elec
tion of Senator John W. Kern, majori
ty leader in the Senate, nnd Thomas
Taggart, in Indiana, but the latest
returns seem to establish beyond a
doubt the victory of the Republican
candidates, Harry S. New and James
H. Watson.
Another remarkable results was In
Utah, where Senator George Suther
land, Republican, was defeated by
William If. King, Democrat.
In New Mexico the Democrats may
gain the seat held by Senator Catron
as their nominee. A. A. Jones, is
slightly ahead of Frank A. Hubbell
Republican.
Dr. J. 1). Lane. Democratic candi
date for town representative, wishes
to hereby express his thanks to the
voters of Bennington for their gener
ous and loyal support at the polls
Tuesday.

WOMEN CARRIED WASHINGTON
Fair Sex's Vote Caused
Democratic
Victory.
Seattle, Wash., Nov. ' 8. Wood
row Wilson can thank tho women of
Washington for the seven electoral
votes which the State cast for him
For the first time in sixteen years
Washington has gone Democratic, and
tho women did it.
Just how much effect the Demo
cratic slogan, "He kept us out of
war," had on the women of this State
Is unknown, but it is certain that the
10,000 to 15,000 plurality which Wash-
ington rolled up for the President Is
due to the woman vote.
OUTGO! iT WHOLLY
WITH CALIFORNIA AND NORTH
DAKOTA FOR WILSON HIS
ELECTION SEEMS SURE
Hughes Apparently Has Carried Minnesota By Bare Lead and
Also Gets West Virginia and Probably One Vote in
Washington New Mexico Is Still Counting
But Changes in New Hampshire Give
That State to Wilson By 117

New York, Nov. 9: 3 o'clock p. m.
As the late returns straggle. In it
seems more and more probable that
Wilson has won the election.
Minnesota which seemed sure for
Hughes up to 11 o'clock took a sud
den turn and the figures at 2.30
showed a Hughes margin of only 538
with 346 districts yet to report.
New Hampshire is also this after
noon given to Wilson by a margin of
117 on corrected returns from every
town in the state.
These changes give Wilson the
election without New Mexico his total
being 268 in the electoral college.
New York, Nov. 9. With California
apparently sure for Wilson tho re
election of President Woodrow Wilson
eeems probable though not yet ab
solutely certain.
Minnesota appears to be sure for
Hughes and his plurality is growing
as the returns from the country dis
tricts come in. Hughes lead in the
state may reach 1000.
New Mexico now seems to be the
most doubtful state. New Mexico has
only three electoral votes and if these
are for Wilson his success would ap-
WATS CLAIM STATE
California Thought to Be Against
Prohibition.
San Francisco. Nov. 8. A tre
mendous vote in San Francisco tipped
the beam early tonight against State
Amendment No. 2, imposing rigid re
strictions on the sale and use of alco
holics. There had been a good ma
jority for the proposition all day.
San Francisco's majority against
the amendment at 5 p. m. was 5(1,089.
Amendment No. 1, for complete
Prohibition, has not seemed at any
time to be a winner.
MAINE FOR HUGHES
His Plurality There Only Little Over
5,000.
Portland. Nov. 8 Practically
complete returns tonight of the heav
iest Presidential vote ever cast in
Maine with tho exception of that at
the "Greenback" election in 1880, gave
Hughes a plurality of 5,118. He had
08.545. against 63,427 for President
Wilson. In tho September election
the Republicans carried the State by
about 13.000.
SOCIALISTS CLAIM GAIN
Hope They Have Elected Three Mem
bers of Congress
New York, Nov. 9. Leaders of the
Socialist party last night asserted it
had polled 1,200,000 votes in the coun
try and 05,000 in this state and had
elected three Representatives in con
gress, thirty-five state legislators, the
mayor of Minneapolis nnd several
candidates elsewhere.
Interest in New Yoirk city centered
in the successful fight of Meyer Lon
don for re election In the Twelfth
Congress District, and the defeat of
Manis Hillquit In the Twelth. Hill
quit charged violations of law in
polling places, and said he probably
would ask for a recount. Figures at
Socialist headquarters put him only
150 votes behind Isaac Siegel, his Re
publican opponent. The highest prev
ions Socialist figures in the district
were doubled by the Hillqult's vote.
The other undisputed Socialist vic
tory in New York was the re-election
of Assemblyman A. I. Shlplacoff
of the Hrownsvillo district. Victory
was also claimed for Joseph A. White
horn in tho Twenty-third Assembly
District.
In Milwaukee Socialists claim the
election of both Victor Merger, tho
first Socialist to hold a scat In. the
House, and of State Senator W. R.
C.aylord. The latter'B claim, however,
is disputed by W. L. Cary, Republican, j
WW BUT
patently be assured.
North Dakota, which last night
bobbed back and forth from one
column to the other Is now safely
tucked away in the Wilson line with a
lead of 847 and only 40 more districts
to report. These cannot change the
result unless some error is found in
the other returns.
In West Virginia the Hughes lead is
increasing with today's returns and
there seems no question that he has
carried the state by a safe margin.
An error was found today in adding
the returns from Mendiclno county,
California and the correction in
creaseed the Wilson margin by over
2000 votes. With only 326 California
districts to report the Wilson lead Is
3533. The remaining districts are
mostly in the southern part of the
state where Hughes is strong but it
is not probable that they can over
come the Wilson margin up the state.
Hughes is likely to get one vote In
Washington as one of the Democra
tic electors died Sunday night. An
attempt was made to put a new name
on the ballot by the use of stickers,
but It was not complete enough to
cover the whole state and as a result
it Is probable that one Republican
elector is chosen though Wilson car
ried the state.
In the returns from New ; Mexico
Hughes was leading by 228 votes at
noon, but the missing districts include
several mining towns where Wilson is
strong. Many of the remote districts
are also Democratic due to the senti
ment of the Mexicans naturalized in
this country who are supporters of
Wilson.
The Hughes lead in Oregon has in
creased and It is certain that Hughes
has carried the state. The Demo
crats have practically given up Idaho
where for " time this morning they
had hopes of overcoming the Hughes
lead. .
The vote in the electoral college is
now believed to be as follows though
it will take the official returns Crom
the close states to make the result
absolutely certain:
