FOOTBALL TEAMS
ENTERTAINED
Blae.kfoot demonstrated a. fine com
munity feeling in the hospitality
shown the Idaho Falls football team
when they met on the gridiron last
Friday. Although the result of the
game stood 9 to 7 in favor of Black
foot, the teams were evenly matched
and until Mervin Thomas made a drop
kick as a final play, the game had
scored for Idaho Falls. There were
several minor acidents, Tom Bucklin
of Idaho Falls carrying home the most
serious, a bad back. After dinner at
the hotel the two High Schools were
the guests of Miss Margaret Dubois at
her home on South Main. Two hundred
and fifty guests soon drew around the
huge bonfire and the order of the day
was "Yell." This they proceeded to
do as only high school boys and girls
know how. They were then invited to
cool their parched throats at the punch
bowls in the dining room and library.
Mrs. Vincent, assisted by the Idaho
Falls girls, and Mrs. P. Powers assisted
by Blackfoot boys, presided. Cake,
popcorn and apples disappeared like
dew. Miss Barron at the piano fur
nished music for dancing and the fun
and frolic lasted until train time,
when the merry kindly feeling of .fel
lowship ended in farewell yells.

IDAHO FALLS LOSES
GAME TO BLACKFOOT
The sun had set beftind the distant
mountains and lamplighters were
busy lighting their lamps. A long
shrill whistle was heard on the grid
iron, a momentary silence from a great
throng; faintly, in the far approaching
darkness twenty-two dusky individuals
could be seen to cease their struggles,
they parted, eleven going to friends
on one side of the field and eleven to
friends on the other side. The whis
tle was sounding the knell of the end
of the Idaho Falls-Blackfoot football
game and the two teams of eleven
making their way to friends were the
victor and vanquished.
Hardly were the echoes of that W'his
tle stilled when 300 wearers of the red
and white burst forth in a frenzy of
joy. Their team had won.
Defeated but not discouraged or
down-hearted the great throng of
Idaho Falls rooters rallied around their
team and cheered them as loudly as if
they had won.
It was a remarkable exhibition of
loyalty and such that even Blackfoot
wondered at it. The orange and black
had been defeated it was true, but
out-played. It is a sad story to re
late.
Hardly had the game started when
Dame Fortune, viewing the contest
from her throne on high, cast her for
tunes with Blackfoot. Capt. Bloin
quist of Blackfoot won the toss and
chose to defend the south goal with
the advantage of having a blinding
sun at his back. The kick off went
to the goal line and Wackerli was
downed on his ten yard line. A mix
up in signals and the ball was thrown
behind the goal line. Big Stephens
(Bacon) of Blackfoot spied it lying
there and without waiting for orders
pounced upon the oral as though it
were a gold nugget. Slowly Idaho
A touchdown and six points had been
given to Blackfoot. The -try at goal
was missed.
Not discouraged by this bit of mis
fortune the local team came back
fighting harder than- ever. From the
great crowd of rooters came the plea
to fight to win, to beat Blackfoot. And
the team did play hard to win for they
knew that to score a touchdown and
then to kick a goal would mean vic
tory for them. But Blackfoot was
equally determined not to let the Falls
beat them and used every means to
keep safe the margin they had received
from the Idaho Falls team. But there
was more misfortune in store for the
orange and black. Out of the tangle of
players came "Tommy" Bucklin,
sturdy right end for Idaho Falls, lioss
de-combat. Eddy went in for Buck
lin. The teams see-sawed up and down
and across the field and wlieu the
half was up the score was Blackfoot
6; Idaho Falls 0.
During the halves the rival rooters

that he had a majority of about 800.
The largest vote cast in Bingham
county since division gave Davis, the
Republican candidate for governor a
majority of about 160, and the Republi
can candidates and state ticket gen
erally a majority of between 160 and
500. Wilson got a majority of about
200. Senator Thomas was re-elected
by about 170 majority, and Representa
tive Peter G. Johnson got a majority
of about 140. Wilford N. Christensen,
Republican, and W. C. Sollenberger,
Democrat, for commissioner, were
elected by good majorities, and the
vote is so close betw-een Jed Taylor and
F. T. Halverson for commissioner that
the winner will not be known until the
official count, which is now progress
ing, shall have been completed. B.
Harvey Allred, H. Andrew Benson and
James Young, Democratic candidates
for representative, assessor and survey
or, received majority votes. Grace
Faulconer, Republican, for school su
perintendent, got a majority of about
exchanged songs and yells.
There was determination in every
member of the Idaho Falls eleven as
they took the field for the second half.
Imagine the joy in the hearts of the
orange and black rooters when
Wackerli took one of Blackfoot's punts
and ran for a touchdown. It was a
wonderful run that "Wack" made,
sixty-five yards, through, the whole
Blackfoot team. This tied the score
and everyone held their breath while
Payne -set # the ball in Capt. Shuttle
worth's hands for the try at goal.
The angle was a difficult one to kick
from, although the ball had been
' ' kicked out for a better position to
try for the goal. True as a die the
ball sailed between the uprights. The
Idaho Falls crowd run riot on the
field, dancing, yelling and cheering.
Score, Blackfoot 6; Idaho Falls 7.
With this one point margin the local
eleven played safe, but in the last
quarter, quarter back Thomas of
Blackfoot, dropped back on the twenty
five yard line and. drop-kicked the
ball over the goal for three points.
This made the score Blaekfoot. 9; Ida
ho Falls 7. There was still a ehance
for the locals, they had not "opened
up" any of their trick plays and with
five minutes yet to play every mem

300 over Bartlett, Democrat. Ralph
Adair, for county attorney, was re
elected by a flattering majority, and
James Good, for probate judge, was
elected by a small majority. A. H.
Simmons, Republican, got a majority of
215 over ^F. E. DeKay, his Democratic
opponent,
Since going to press with our four
inside pages yesterday afternoon when
Hughes was thought elected we pub
lished his picture as our next presi
dent. Later reports favor the re-elec
tion of President Wilson, who it is
claimed has 212 of the 319 electoral
votes.
. At 1 oc'clock the commissioners had
canvassed the county vote with the
exceptions of Shelley, Rich and Basalt
precincts, which had not yet arrived.
From present indications Halverson
has beaten Taylor for commissioner,
which makes two Democratic solons.
The Democrats have also elected a rep
resentative, the assessor and surveyor.
* Up to the time of going to press the
election of Hughes was very dubious,
as was alBO the election of the govern
or, but Davis this morning sent word
forts. In four downs the ball was car
ried to the Blackfoot twenty-five yard
line. It was getting dark fast. Wack
erli was called back for a try at goal
from drop kick formation. It was a
hard kick, the ball never rising from
the ground. The last chance to de
feat Blackfoot was gone. Time was
called shortly after with Blackfoot in
possession of the ball on their twenty
yard line.
During the last quarter of the second
half "Percy" Finley was slightly in
jured and "Red" Randall took his
place.
The line up was as follows:
Idaho Falls—Bucklin and Eddy right
end; Shuttleworth (capt.) right tackle;
Jeffry, right guard; Thomas, center;
left tackle; Payne, left end; Sauter,
quarter back; Wackerli, full back;
Hutchinson, left half back; Anderson,
right half back.
Blackfoot—Good, right end; Hoover;
right tackle; King, light guard
Ready, Center; Faulconer, and Chub
buck, left guard; L. Stephens, left end;
Thomas, quarter back; D. Stephens,
full back; Blomquist and Clenenger,
left half back; Jones right half back.
Obermeyer, fonder Notre Dame star,
refereed the game and gave splendid
satisfaction.

YORK OAR CAPSIZES
Last Sunday afternoon the Brice
York family met with a most terrify
ing experience, yet all escaped without
injury. A party of six ,three grown
persons and three children were on their
way from Blackfoot to their ranch
here. The roads were a little slippery
and in making the turn to go onto
the bridge over the big canal near
Alex Vaughn's, struck a little high,
then swung back and went over the
lowerside of the bridge with atl its
passengers.
Fortunately there was only about a
foot of water in the canal and as the
car lay peacefully on its side all were
able to wade to safety.
That particular bridge has been a
menace to every motorist in this lo
cality, being a long span and a bad
angle, and some day some one is going
over it for the last time, that is, over
the soutfi edge of it.
BAZAAR
On the Saturday of stake conference
a scrap bag bazaar will be conducted
by the stake board members of the
Y. L. M. T. A. in the north rooms of
the Blackfoot First Ward Meeting
House from 10 a. m. to 5 p. m. There
will be no sales during the time of
meetings. Notions, gifts, useful house
hold articles und clothing will be down
to zero in price. Wo earnestly Solicit
your patronage.

BLACKFOOT WINS
CHAMPIONSHIP
In the closest kind of a game tha
Blaekfoot High School won the cham
pionship of Southeastern Idaho on Fri
day afternoon at the Fair Grounds.
The game was replete with thrills and
exciting incidents. Blackfoot scored
first by intercepting a fumble from
the Idaho Falls full back. Capt. Steph
ens with his usual faculty of being
in the right place scooped up the ball
and ran through a broken field for
the first score. Thomas missed the
goal. It looked like the 6 to 0 would
stand as the final score, but luck took
a turn and the Tdaho Falls player re
ceived a punt and ran 50 vnrds for a
touchdown. Wakerlii kicked the goal,
making the score 6 to 7 against the
home team. Time was drawing near
to a close and desperate offensive work
on the part of Blackfoot characterized
the remainder of the play, while de
fensive work of no less desperation
the order of the Idaho Falls captain.
The ball see-sawed back and forth for
several minutes, often Blackfoot would
almost reach the coveted goal, only to
bo held for downs. Just before the
crowd began to move away with a de
jected feeling, the ball was worked
down to the Idaho Falls thirty yard
line and Thomas fell back for a drop
kick. It was a last effort and th«
game depended upon it. True as an
arrow the ball sailed over the bar for
the count of three and the game was
won. Idaho Falls had fought a game
battle, but could not overcome the
lead in the few moments left. Thom
as, Louis Stephens and Taylor played
star games for Blackfoot while Waker
lii was half the Idaho Falls team both
on offensive and defense. Overineyer
and Marlowe officiated in fine shape.
Blackfoot now has the chance to play
Twin Falls for the championship of
Southern Idaho. This game will be
Nov. 17th, at Twin Falls.
