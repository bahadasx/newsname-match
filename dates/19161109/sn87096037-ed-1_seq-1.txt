Democrats with Wood
row Wilson came back to
power in the election of
1012. The Republican conven
tion in Chicago nominated Taft,
who was now opposed bitter
ly by Roosevelt. There were
many contested delegates, and
those in authority seated a ma
jority of delegates with Taft
proclivities.
Roosevelt had many warm sup
porters and was an avowed can
didate. When Taft was nomi
nated Roosevelt formed the Pro
gressive party and ran on the
third ticket.
The vote in 1912 was: Wilson,
0,293,019 Roosevelt, 4,119,507
Taft, 3,484,956. Wilson received
435 votes in the electoral college,
Roosevelt 88 and Taft 8. Thom
