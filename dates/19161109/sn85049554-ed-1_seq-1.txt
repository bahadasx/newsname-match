*We only ask what is fair," he said,
"and only ask what we are entitled to."
Situation Changes.
An eleventh hour development in the
election situation came this morning
from Concord, N. H., where Secretary
of State Bean stated that with the re
turns of the state complete, but only
partly verified officially, Wilson led by
93'votes. Verification of the returns
was still in. progress.
To Invsstigate Dead Elector Vote.
Chairman. McCormick said today he
would investigate reports that repub
licans in Washington' state may get
one of the electoral votes on the
ground that the votes cast for a dem
ocratic elector who died'were invalid.
According to reports the name of E.
M. Connor, the democratic elector, who
was substituted* for A. Stream, the
dead elector, "did not Appear on the
ballot in many counties, and tt was
stated that therefore the votes cast for'
Stream might be invalid, the difference
giving a plurality for one republican
elector.
"We will investigate the matter,"
said Chairman McCbrmick. "But if we
are forced to concede the vote I am
not worried by the loss of one electoral
vote."
President Wilson Is Confident.
Long Branch, N. J., Nov. 9.—'Presi
dent Wilson arose early to hear again
that the outcdme-of Tuesday's election
was not yet certainr~-£U^ planned to
motor today.
Mr. Wilson's first question j^ad to do,
with California, Minnesota, New Mex
ico and North Dakcttsy the states, he
waa told last night,, on which the result
largely hinged. When Informed that
definite word had not been received he
realised thfst he would have to wait
longer for the .final outcome.
The president was In a chereful
mood and 'believed. the result event
ually would favor him.
Tumulty Optimistic.
At noon Secretary Tumulty got into
communication with the democratic
headquarters at New Tork and Chica
go and received official news which led
the officiate here to express more con
fidence than at any time since election.
It was reported that California prob
acy would give Wilson from 6,000 to
15,000 majority. Optimistic reports al
so were received from New Mexico, and
New Hampshire was definitely claimed
here for the president
former Senator Watson, democratic
chairman of West Virginia, seat word
that that state was sure for Wilson.
From Chicago came word that the
Hughes' lead, in Indiana waa rapidly

Paris, Nov. 9.—The American elec

Interest, thq news having the place of
honor in most of the morning papers.
The commentators, mindful of the
dramatio surprise of yesterday, when
the supposedly Hughes' victory was
turned to a 'possible defeat, are reluct
ant to commit themselves.
The majority of the comment Is
similar to (hat of the Petit Journal,
which expresses the Belief that the
victory of either candidate will have
little effect on the American policy so
far as big questions affecting France
are concerned. The Matin remarks
that the election of Mr. Hughes would
mean a more vlg9rous pollby and
protectionist regime.

republican: state centraf committee
chairman, said at 9:10 'o'clock this
morning that estimated* county totals
for all the state showed Hughes run
ning 200 votes behind' the president.
Rowell declined to concede Caltfornlf

the aierrs. counties, sixteen precincts,

of another mountain district, Tyo

Lack of telephone communication Is
responsible for the delay.
Five thousand five hundred sixty

nia give Hughes, 44$,84 Wilson,

Wilson. This Includes complete San
TVancisco city and a few upstate pre
cincts.
Possibility of Spilt Vote.
Possibility of a split electoral vote is
hot at all remote. in California and
especially Is it made likely the selec
tion because of the scratching of A. 3.
Wallace, republican presidential
elector by the radical wots, because
Wallace Is one of the foremost drys.
For Instance, should- Hughes carry
California there Is a possibility of
Wilson taking one vote from the state
electoral college.
In California presidential electors
are voted In party groups, each hav
ing thirteen. When the ballots aire
canvassed the thirteen presidential
electors receiving the highest totals
are declared elected and are certified
b" the secretary of state.
The voter may cast his ballot for any
party group as a whole -or- he may. vote
for electors in all parties so long as
he does not vote for more than
thirteen.

to America After the War.
Chicago, Nov. 9. A plan to bring
50,000 Polish colonists to the United
States at the close of Lhe Eurouean
war is the project of Maximilian Shott
land of Warsaw, who arrived at tho
Biackstone Hotel yesterday. It l»
hoped, he said, to Interest .wealthy
Americans in extending financial sup
port to the plan.
'Germany is near economic exhaus
tion," Mr. Shottland said, "and I be
lieve the war will end by spring. After
that the world must do something for
Poland, which is devastated beyond
imagination. Twenty-five per cent of
the population of 22,000,000 are home
less and the land Is so cut up by zig
zag trenche^ that it will be ten years
before it again can be cultivated.
"The United States has millions of
acres of unoccupied land which can
be made productive If cultivated. It la
my plan to deliver several lectures
while In Chicago and to have a con
ference with railroad officials."
Mr. Shottland, whose present home
Is in London, is a well-known Polish
novelist and newspaper writer on
economic subpects. He is the author
of 'The Iron Passport," written before
the war, which .foretold the present
struggle.
BAKER NOT TO RE8IGN.

Washington, Nov. 9.—"I have not re

be a sure thing."
This was the statement of Secretary
of War Baker.
The secretary of war ^rould not dis

New York, Nov. 9.—Henry Morgen
tljau, in charge of the democratic head
quarters, this morning, In the absence
of Chairman McCormick, said a re
count would be demanded for the vote
I in New Hampshire. This, he said,
would be done in spite of the figures
received this morning showing that
Wilson had a lead of a few votes. He
added that the democratic ilgures
showed the Wilson lead was 500 votes
and that in view of the complex situ
ation in that state a recount in any
event would be necessary.
Chairman McCormick, on his return,
said:
"It's all over. We have cleaned them
up. We stick unflinchingly to our orig
inal figures. Wilson by 28S electoral
votes."
Mr. McCormick added every precau
tion was being taken to protect the
ballot boxes.
Managers Stand by Claims.
Meanwhile it was Indicated at both
headquarters that in states where the
vote was close a recount would be
demanded. Both sides again announc
ed they were taking precautions to
guard the ballot boxes.
Mr. MoCormick reiterated his claim
that President Wilson would be re
elected with 288 electoral votes, twen
ty-two more than enough to. bring him
to victory. Mr. McCormick claimed
North Dakota, California, New Mexico
and New Hampshire, and Insisted the
^d^mocrats -4ifid, a good, chaflce to win
Minnesota.
Mr, Willcox said He stood by his
'statement of last rii^ht that Hughes
would get 280 electoral votes.
Charles E. Warren, republican na
tional committeeman from Michigan,
declared that Oregon and West Vir
ginia were safely for Hughes, and that
the outcome depended on Minnesota.-^
California, North Dakota, New Mexico
and"'New Hampshire. In the last four
states named, he said, the official
count will be necessary to determine
the result.
Congreas in Doubt.
Returns on the election for members
of congress received up to 1 o'clock to
day showed 212 democrats and 203 re
publicans elected with sixteen dis
tricts yet to be accounted for.
'Seven of these sixteen districts are
democratic In the present congress and
ninevare republicans. Should eacii re
tain its present affiliation, the count
would stand„, democrats, 219 republi
cans, 212.
Republican Chairman Claims State.
Philip A. Faulkner, chairman of the
republican state committee, has issued
the following statement:
"The claim that the state has gone
for Wilson Is unsubstantiated by re
turns. Fully forty township clerks
have rendered no official returns of the
vote, but the figures we have indicate
that Hughes had carried New Hamp
shire by about 100 plurality. We do not
concede New Hampshire to the demo
crats, and we are prepared to substan
tiate our claims of republican victory
before any competent tribunal."
Wilson Leads by 121.
Concord, N. H„ Xov. 8.—With two
precincts mlswing the count In New

Bean corrected his earlier statement in
which he said that the state was com
plete. The two towns unreported cast
a very small vote.
Certified returns for 248 precincts out
of 294 in New Hampshire give Hughes
37,072 WHson, 36,793. For the balance
of the state the secretary of state has
only press returns- and this, combined
with the certified vote, placed Wilson's
plurality at 117.
