AS A CAMPAIGNER
Hornell, N. Y., Sept. 80. Jlcpubll-
can Nominee Hughes today finished
his twentieth thousand tulles as a
presidential campaigner here in his
home state of New York. This Is said
to establish a record for presidential
candidates. -
It was estlmsted today that
Hughes has talked to 1,600.000
voters since he started seeking votes
August 5.
After such a record-breaking cam
patgn, not yet concluded, It was no
wondor today that Hughes showed
fatigue In every line of his face. His
eyes were ringed with dark circles,
n lce aa almost cracked un-
I" lne ,tra,n-
i Winding up with a big meeting at
Buffalo tonight, Hughes will return
to New York tomorrow. From then
until October 8 there will be little
but rest on the 'program for the
Hughes family.
For thre .days the candidate will
remain at the Astor hotel, then-he
will go to some secluded spot to rest
up for his next stumping tour.

milk laws, but the golden state takes
the lead In putting It ona broad and
sweeping scale.
"I predict," said Dr. Keane today,
'.'that when other atates observe the
good effects of this law thoy will
rapidly fall in line with similar legis
lation." The law requires the pasteurisation
of nil milk sold at retail for human
consumption, except when the milk
Is froiit cows free from tuborculosls.
If a dairyman does not rhoono to
have his cows tested, ho will be re
quired to have the milk pasteurised.
However, tho great number of ap
plications show that a big majority
of the dairymen will choose the test.
This Indicates, ( according to Dr.
Keane, that there will not be an nd
vnnce In tho prlco of milk. Pas
teurized milk brings a higher price,
but comparatively few dairymen will
chooso pasteurisation.

adroit elocution and by the simple
policy of drugging our souls with
the narcotic of meaningless phrase
mongering," In wblcb "these fine,
words have bad, the meaning weasled
out of them."
Roosevelt devoted more than a
third of his speech to decrying the
stand taken by the president In the
German controversies and In the
Mexican situation. He followed with
denunciation of the administration's
attitude on preparedness. During
the last half he went deeply In de
tail In criticising the manner In which
President Wilson (Verted the nation

"At the outset," said Roosevelt,
"I -wish to say a Word as to protests
made by so 1 many people that we
must not criticise the president. I
did 'stand by the president' for a year
and a half. It was with reluctance,
however, as I wss forced to the con
clusion that to do so longer was In
compatible with standing by the in
terests of mankind and the honor of
the United States.
"I, am convinced vthe conscience of.
this people has been seared and Its
moral sense dulled by the leadership
of the administration and congress
during the last three years. v
"Mr. Wilson's supporters esy we
should vote for him for keeping us
out of war. It Is worth while to re
member this could not have been said
In behalf of either George Washing

men spurned the torjes and copper
heads with contemptuous Indigna-

Interpreted here as a special warning

It is thought possible this warn

At the same time It Is believed that
