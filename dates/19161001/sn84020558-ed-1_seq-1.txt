"The Kuropcan war could not have

Villa, who was at one time the prime
favorite of the administration. Car
ranza was eventually recognized, but up'
to t lie present time he has never rec
ognized the I'nited States.
"Free trade made two men for one
job, while protection has always made
two jobs fur one man; the war in Eu
rope only saved the democrats from one
of the worst panics of the age. The
first ear of the administration brought
depression which was only warded olf
by the sudden outbreak of war."
The close attention of the large audi
ence throughout his splendid address
was evidence that the people were
ib-enly Impressed with the message he
gave them.
Henry L. Kails, candidate for con
press, made a short talk. Miss Helen
Todd, the noted woman suffragist, who
had addressed the women of Flagstaff
during the afternoon, was grunted an
opportunity after Senator Ih.rton's
ieech to make an appeal to the women
fur assistance In election men who were
favorable to the cause. She was a most
interesting and pleasing talker and
captivated the people with her earnest

slate candidates headed by Tom Camp

John R. Wright presided, interspersing
strum: arguments in a witty vein as
each speaker was presented by him.
The strenuous campaigning of the
past week and open air speaking
showed tonight in Campbell's weak
ened voice. As the big fellow warmed,
the hoarseness disappeared and he
made one of the strongest arguments of
the campaign. Speaking on the indus
trial situation in the state, Campbell
paid he introduced the first eight-hour"!
lay bill for labor ever presented to an
Arizona legislature. That was in 1901
when Hunt was a member of the legis
lature and showed no particular in
terest in labor then. Campbell told of
his friendship with labor leaders who
called him by his first name and who
understood him and whom he under
stood. He paid a high compliment to
them.
In his message to the laboring men
he said he addressed his words to the
workers; not the workers who worked
the workers, lie reiterated his slogan
on fairness and firmness with both
rapilal and labor and pointed to the
tax rolls as evidence of his fairness and
firmness with capital and to his long
years as an employer of labor in Yava
pai county and his fairness and firm
ness with labor.
"I will give no special privilege to
any special class, and that is my spe
cialty." he said.
Jeorge H. Smalley, was the first
speaker, this being his home town. He
was given an ovation by his towns
jieople. Smalley spoke on taxation and
a budget law for the state. He told of
Kihbey's success in taxing mines.
Ioane Merrill spoke of the absent
candidates for ntatp office mid of his
own experience which so well qualified
him for state auditor.

work.
H. E. Matthews made a fine impres

school conditions and his program for

TO THE IBM
Thomas F. Weedin. registrar of the
I'nited States Land office, and one of
the best known of the old Behind citi
zens of -.4 Arizona died last night at I
twelve o'clock, at his home, 322 Culver I
street, after an illness of a few weeks.
Mr. Weedin underwent a minor oper
ation last week, and it is thought that
this added to his advanced age. was the
cause of his death. The body has been
taken to the undertaking parlors of
Moore and McLellan. Funeral arrange
ments have not as yet been made.
His daughter Jennie I". Weedin was
with him at the end.
Practically all of the vital and impor
tant interests which go to make up the
sum of human existence have at some
time claimed the aitention of Thomas
F. Weedin, editor, businessman, states
man and public spirited citizen.
His activities have been as varied as
they have Iwen important and in their
effects as beneficial as they have !ecn
far reaching, placing him among the
racial, puluical and business, leaders of
Phoenix. Mr. Weedin was born
Cooper county, Missouri, December lf.
1 Sf.4, and since he was nine years of
age has been Identified with Journalism.
At that time he went to Kansas City
and became connected as a newsboy
with the Kansas City Times, rising
through all the different departments
of the business, thoroughlv learning
newspaper work in principal and detail.
During this time he attended night
school, lull when he went to St. Louis,
he laid aside his text books, and gave
his attention entirely to journalism un
til 1H73 when ho went to Tennessee and
established his first journal in Rrowns
ville, calling it the lirow-nsville Iierno
crat. In 1S75 he was editor of tiie Daily
Herald at Fremont Nebraska, and in
the following year became city editor of
the Omaha Herald. After two years in
that responsible position he was made
criir of the Daily Prospect, at Silver
Cliff, Colorado, and abandoned that po
sition to take up prosoecting and min
ing there.
His interests along that line brought
him from Silver City to Tombstone,
Arizona in 1SS0, but on the following
year he again resumed newspaper work,
establishing the Enterprise at Florence
on March 28th of that year. That paper
he conducted until President Cleve
land's first administration, when he was;
appointed clerk of the I'nited States
court in his district, serving ably and
efficiently until 1900. He then estab

FOR CA1ANZA
(Special to The Republican)
LOS ANGELES, Sept. 30. The
ramifications of the campaign that
brought about the recognition by
President Wilson of General Carranza
as the de facto executive of the Mexi
can government and which reached
into high places in Washington; the
fact that the proclamation of policies
that was issued by Carranza was
framed up in Washington without his
knowledge, was "edited" by President
Wilson, passed through various hands,
and finally was sent down to Carranza,
and issued by him: the fact that Sec
retary Bryan, his Man Friday, Richard
L. Metcalf ; former Governor Folk and
John Lind. Wilson's special agent in
Mexico, were prominent figures in the
campaign that brought a change of
view to President Wilson which narra
tive has been set forth as related by
Kiehard II. Cole of Pasadena, who en
gineered the entire campaign are now
disclosed. These facts continue to be
mailers of special interest in the dis
cussion of national issues. It appears
thev aro especially distasteful to derm
cratic leaders and that they would
gladly ignore them.
There is a strong disinclination to
talk on the part of the men mentioned
in the narrative of Mr. Cole.
An Associated Press dispatch from
St. Paul in telling of an interview on
the subject with John Lind, former
governor of Minnesota and representa
live of President Wilson in Mexico
'during the Huerta regime, says: "John
Lind said tonight he knw of no one
named Cole during his Mexican work.
He was emphatic and angry about it."
When Mr. Cole's attention was di
rected to this statement yesterday he
expressed himself as much abused over
the situation and Mr. land's lack of
remembrance.
"I first met Mr. Lind in Washington
in April," said Mr. Cole. "He was in
troduced to me as a friend of General
Carranza's and he spoke in highest
praise of Carranza. While he had never
met him. he was a strong champion of
the Mexican general.
I met Mr. Lind from time to time up
to the time of the president's recogni
tion of Carranza. John Lind was one
of the men who helped draft the proc
lamation, afterwards Issued by Car
ranza. He worked on this draft for
several days. The men who framed
this draft were Mr. Lind, Richard L.
Metcalf. right hand man for William
Jennings l'.ryan; former Governor Folk,
who was Wilson's special agent in
Mexico, Charles Douglass, chief coun
sel for Carranza in Washington; Henry-
Allen Tupper of the peace forum and
myself.
"I was in every conference in Wash
ington for a year that pertained to the
campaign for the recognition of Car
ranza. and 1 know just what was go
ing mi.
"Well the recognition was accom
plished, I went to Piedras Negras after
the recognition, for the purpose of
meeting General Carranza. I reached
the border before he did, and stopped
In Eagle Pass, on the American side of
the international line. I was a guest
of the Eagle hotel and when I arrived
there I found John Lind was already
there also a guest at this hotel.
"John Lind and I spent three days
there waiting for Carranza to arrive.
Lind and I went over into Mexico and
hunted and fished. After General Car
ranza arrived, Mr. Lind spent two days
visiting with him, and then returned
north. I rather think that Mr. Lind
ran remember me if he puts forth some
little effort.
"I've heard that John Lind has an
oil concession at Tampico, and that his
son is now down there.
"While we were at Piedras Negras
last November for the purpose of see
ing General Carranza, we had a group
picture taken. It speaks for itself. In
this group were John Lind, President
Wilson's personal representative in
Mexico; John Sillimann, the represent
ative of the United States with Car
ranza; Jesus Acuna. minister of for

the failure of American bankers to

port of his attack.
"It is said by the administration
that they desire to open the door for

said. "What is the inducement for
our merchants and business men to
go to foreign countries and engage
in American enterprise, if they and
their investments are treated as our
citizens and their proierty were per
mitted to be treated in Mexico?"
Prouosed participation by Ameri

brought forth today an authoritative,
though informal statement from the
department of state of the American
government's attitude toward the situ
ation.
Any action which endangers Ameri
can lives through the sinking of ships
without warning or by failing to pro
vide proper safeguards, it was em
phatically asserted, will immediately
re-open the submarine question with
all its possibilities. But so far, in spite
of what is going on in Germany, there
has been absolutely no indication in the
official advices that Germany has vio
lated the agreement arrived at in the
Sussex case. Reports of the sinking of
nearly 300 merchant ships since June 1
have been received officially, but in no
case has it been proven that American
lives were endangered. High offlcialf,
think it unnecessary to make any for
mal stii'ement on the subject, as they
feel the American position is fully
known both at home and abroad.
However, the possibilities which a
change of Germany's policy might open
are so great that every effort will be
made to have a full understanding on
all sides. All dispatches received here

it has failed to re-establish confid

being in the nature of a reply to
President Wilson's recent declaration

Mr. Hughes renewed his attack on

edged that there is considerable opposi
tion in Germany to this policy. But so
far as is known here the opposition ta
the government's policy is no stronger
than before.
The chancellor's latest speech is not
interpreted in American official quar
ters as foreshadowing his conversion to
ruthless submarine activity, for it is
pointed out that tie may well hold that
Germany is now gaining all that can
possibly be gained from her submarine
weapon.
Others, however, are inclined to take
the opposite view, believing that the
chancellor has been won over to the von

the gradual crushing in of the German
lines and the increased realization that
England is the super-enemy, pressure
in Germany will become irresistible to

BATTLE CREEK, Alien.. Sept. 30.
Speaking to a great throng of per
sons who were packed in a cold cir
cus Tent here this afternoon. Colonel
Roosevelt assailed the administration
of President Wilson and urged the
elcctiDn of Charles E. Hughes. He
was given a tremenduous ovation.
Climbing on a table on the speaker'9
platform, the colonel read his prepared
address, which was devoted almost
entirely to an attack on President
Wilson's foreign and Mexican policies,
and the latter's support of the Adam
son eight-hour bill.
Colonel Roosevelt declared that
President Wilson's chief policy was
the policy of vacillation. He declared
the president, in "fifteen messages,
letters, and speeches,' made from
December 9, 1914, to February 10,
1916, "took 41 different positions about
preparedness and the measures neces
sary to secure it, and each of these
41 positions contradicted from one to
six of the others."
The European policy of President
Wilson's, particularly in the Lusi
tania case, was referred to as "humili
ating and ignoble."
The Mexican record of the execu
tive was called "ruinous to Mexico,
dishonorable to ourselves and infa
mous from the standpoint of hu
manity.' Discussing the Adamson bill, Mr.
Roosevelt charged that President Wil
son, in urging the passage of the
measure by congress, "took his or
ders from that one of the parties
which he most feared."
"We have seen in this country few
things more discreditable to our rep
resentatives and more ominous for
the. future of the nation than the
spectacle of the. president-and con
gress of the United States being re
quired tc pass a certain bill before a
certain hour at the dictation of cer
tain men who sat in the gallery with
their w.nti lies in their hiinili thpunian
ling ruin and disaster to the nation if
there was the smallest failure to
satisfy their demands," said Roose
velt. The colonel referred to the torpedo
ing of the Lusilania by a German
sunmarine as "the most colossal sin
gle instance of the murder of non
combatants, including men, -women
and children, that had been oer
petrated by any power calling itseli
civilized, for over a century."
Colonel Roosevelt said in part:
At the outset I wish to sav a word

and individuals making these protests

president, took the view that no' one
had aright to speak untruthfully of
the President or of anyone else, but
that even less than anyone else ought
