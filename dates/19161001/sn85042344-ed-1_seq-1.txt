Till-! average business niun bus
heard the talk uliout "good

Ilow it Is like so much "t'nkling brass."

the work belli done to improve the

Very little Improvement. This docn
not apply so much to Tuba county,
liecauso In this county much Kood
woi k has been done witn the medioc re
material available and passable liirt
roads have been the result, but in the
inaorlty of counties in the state ot
Oklahoma good roads has been a po
litical bellwether to lead the way for
Voles, with little action following.
The main fault ha i been tho lack
cf a system on which P: base the
work. A few miles of some road
K-nding out of this town and into that
town have been improved, a few more
miles over In this end of the. county
have been worked and over that way
chort stretch has been made pass
able. The total result being that oni
Might travel for a few minutes over
a good road only to be oumped into
the mud holes and ruts of an almos'.
Impassable road the next few minutes.
Necessarily, the benefits of good
roads have been few and I he milium
dollars spent each year in improving
dirt roads tn Oklahoma has been al
most a totHl waste. A few stretches
here and there, but leading no a here,
do not aid the great body of farmer."

They do not aid the mi-rH'.-nits in the

Old Order Doomed.

lieved that this old order will chaim'

factor and an essential requirement
before sny of the millions appro

I'nder the terms of the fjderal road
law no government money can be ex
pended on building hurl surfnie'1
roads unless the roads 'begin some

other words, unless thiv connect up
Important towns and localities. In
other ward? one county s-at cannot
j.-i't some of the money ta build a road
from thit. town out In the i outitry a
few mll'is and then leave It.
A good example of tiilr old kind of
I ntlness Is found on ll-e dirt road

FORCES IN EAST

Forces of Von Falken

DIVIDES HIS FORCE
BUT UNITES THEM
There Is Little Change i:
the Homme Front. Says
Latest lfepoit.
TROOPS of tho central powers!
under tho command of (lencral
von Kalkenhayn, former chief of the I
Cermun general staff, have gained a
decisive victory over tho Rumanian
invaders of central Transylvunn. The
Rumanians were crushed between two
forces In a battlo which ragod for
three days. After suffering heavy
losses the Invaders were reported flao
ing in disorder Into the mountains.
The defeat of tho Rumanians wns
brought about by a strategic move
virtually impossible on the western
battlo front. General von Kalken
hayn divided his force of Germans and
Austro-Hur.garlans. While ono body
engaged the invaders around llerman
stadt the others- encircled the Ru
manians and seized Rothenthurg piss
in tho mountains 15 miles southeast
of Hormanstadt and one of tho first
points gained by the Rumanians In
their advance.
Genitalis Succeed.
Both forces then pressed In upon th
Rumanians composed of sections of
the first Rumanian army. Ravarlan
troops holding Rothenthurg checkedan
advance by the second Rumanian army
which attempted to come to th'o aid
of Its surrounded compatriots.
Merlin reports that a large amount of
booty was taken as well as prisoners.
In eastern Transylvania the Ru
manians also suffered a repulse. Their j
attack In the region of Sekely Ldvar.
hlly was clicked and tho German at
tack In tho same section resulted in
the capture of six hundred prisoners.
Fighting continues on the Sommo
front but with little change In the
nositions of the combatants. The Ger
mans continue their counter-attacks!
around Thlepval. Kurt her south the
French advanced north of Rancour!,
driving their wedge In the German
lines there. Merlin reports the re
pulse of llrittsh attacks on this front.
'ost.s Many Men.
During September the Mrltlsh In
their advance on the Somme front
lost almost 120,000 officers and men.
This is at tho rate of S.xoO a day, but
falls below tho dally human cost for
August. Since the offensive began
figures published In London show that
the Mritish have lost approximately
three hundred thousand men In their
efforts to bieuk tho German defenses.
Nonlmportant changes In Mace

Quail are so plentiful in this section
"Hob Whites" are becoming tame and
art- drifting Into tho city. The other
day three ttiall were raptured lu the
downtown section of the city and it lit
not an uncommon sight to see tpi.tll

Tlie hatching season this year was

Local hunters ate guarding (iiall to

authoritative, though Informal, state
ment of the slate department of the
American government's uttittide to
ward the situation.
Any act inn winch endangers Amer

without warning or by falling to pro
Aide proper sufeguurds, it was em

reopen the submarine question with
all Its possibilities. Hut so tar, 111
splto of w hat is going on in Germany,
there lias been absolutely no indica
tion In tho official advices to the de
partment thut Germany has violated
the agreement urrived at In the Sus

We Hear of Sinking.
Iteports of tho sinking of nearly
three hundred merchant ships since
July 1 have been received officially,
but In no case has It been proved that
Aiuerirun lives wire endangered. Un
til such proof Is at hand the situation
will remain Just as it has been since
May 8 when Germany's assurances for
Ibo future In tho Susecx cu.se were ac
cepted. Tho possibilities which a chunuo of
Germany s policy might open up aro
so great that every effort will be mude
to have a full understanding oa alt
sides.
Germany Makes Denial.

All dispatches received by diplomats
friendly to the Teutonic allies are de

there is considerable opposition in
Germany to Oils polity of the govern
