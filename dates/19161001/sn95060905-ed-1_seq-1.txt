TAKING WILD GAME
CENSUS ON ARIZONA '
NATIONAL FORESTS
TUCSOX, Sept 30 A "wild game
census is the latest wrinkle or the
United States Forestr Department
in the Arizona Xew Mexico district,
according to Forest Examiner Aldo
ieopold ,wbo Is in charge of the cen
sus It would be a very nice thing for
the cenusu taker and his aides if the
various wild animals would step right
nri and bA counted when the enumer
ator comes around, but naturall they
are a little bashful and it becomes
necessary to adopt other methods of
counting them
One of the methods used for enum
erating deer is to count the bucks
killed during the season and then
multlpl by a factor. The factor
chosen by Mr. Leopold Is ten to one.
Thus for ever buck killed it is
assumed that there are ten deer of
ever kind In the region of which the
census is being taken Arothr me
thod is to Investigate the deer tracks
and use a factor estimated on the pro
portion of cow tracks to the number
f cattle In a given region
Mr. Leopold believes that the wild
game census will prove of great bene
fit ln the work of wild game protec
tion, and has enlisted the aid of a
number of persons familiar with the
mountain regions in southern Arizona
in getting his data
DODGLAS
SHOOTS NEGRO
DOUGLAS, Sept 30 It is probable
that before the da is over a formal
"omplaint will be drawn against Po
liceman George Gra charging him
with assault with a deadl weapon,
as the result of his shooting Rev. Ed
ward Jones, pastor of the colored
Baptist church, shortl after eleven
o'clock last night on the steps of the
colored Methodist church
Gray feels that he was entirel
Justified In his action and says he
will welcome an Investigation Chief
of Police W. S. Kirby said this morn
ing that he thought it would be better
to have a formal hearing so that the
exact facts in the case ma be learned
and the blame placed where it be
longs. Officer Gray stated this morning
that while on his beat last night he
leard two shots which apparentl
"arae from the colored Methodist
hurch. on Greene street, where a
oanquet was being served ln honor
of the meeting of the conference. It
developed later, however, that the
shots were fired from an alley near
the church.
On bearing the shots Gray rushed
to the church. He sas he was told
by several men coming out of the
basement that the shots were up
stairs. At this time Rev Jones was
coming out of the church, in company
with several other men. The officer
ordered Jones not to leave until he
Investigated the shooting, and started
to enter the church.
He says Jones forbade him to en
ter and when he started In the preach
er grabbed his gun, which he had In
one hand. A tussle ensued and the
preacher was shot In the fleshy part
of the left leg. The wound Is a su
perficial one, the principal Injury be
ing from loss of blood. The minister
was taken to the Calumet hospital.
The shooting caused considerable ex
citement among the people gathered
