WOMEN WILL HELP
E WEEK SUCCESS
Civic League to Keep Wraps,
Packages and Babies for
Trade Guests.
FARMERS WILL COME
More Merchants Approve
Program and Join the
Fare-Rebate Plan.
The Women's Civic League of Co
lumbia will co-operate to make Trade
Week a still greater success.
Mrs. W. E. Harshe, president of the
league, suggested to I. A. Barth, presi
dent of the Retail Merchants' Asso
ciation yesterday morning that the
rest rrom at the court house and the
Commercial Club rooms be turned
over to the women of Boone County as
restrooms during Trade Week. Mrs.
Harshe said that the Civic League will
provide women attendants to look af
ter packages, wraps, and babies that
the visiting women might desire to
leave at rest rooms while they are
shopping or visiting friends in the
city.
"The Co-operative Trade Week that
the leading merchants of Columbia
are planning for October 9 to 14 in
clusive, is the best Idea that has ever
been presented to the business men of
this city," was the statement yester
day of a merchant who was one of
the first to sign the agreement. He
Is an active member of the Retail
Merchants' Association.
"I can't see how any merchant who
has the best interests of his town and
hig own individual business at heart
can refuse to co-operate with his
brother merchants in such a con
structlve Idea," this man continued.
Plans, for the big event, whic
starts a week from tomorrow, are
rapidly materializing. Every farmer
who came to Columbia yesterday was
presented with an invitation to come
to Columbia next week and to invite
his neighbors to do likewise. The in
vitation brought forth many favorable
comments and many of the merchants
were asked additional information re
garding the fare-rebate plan.
A half dozen more merchants join
ed the plan yesterday, bringing the
total nearly to thirty. It Is thought
now that the total number will be in
the neighborhood of fifty before the
plans for the week are completed.
Several merchants who did not clearly
understand the conditions of the re
fund came in when they saw the tre
menduous possibilities for increasing
their business anHi extending a wel
come to new customers when it comes
to retail trade. ,
"If Champaign, 111., a 'college town
can attract 1,000 customers whose to
tal mileage amounted to 26,000 miles
in one week, certainly Columbia can
do the same trick or better." was the
comment of an officer of the Commer
cial club yesterday.
One thing that must clearly be un
derstood is that the benefits of the
co-cperative trade week idea will go
only to those who sign the agreement.
This is true, because no meflchant in
dividually can afford to rebate rail
road fares to his own customers.
This can only be successfully done
when several work together.
Another thing that should be clearly
understood is that the co-operative
trade week Is not to be a cheap cut
rate bargain sale, for people gener
ally have learned that these- things
do not pay In the long run either
customer or; merchant. The mer
chant who gives the very best bargains
for the money every day in the year
is the one who succeeds and pleases
his customers at the same time.
The merchants who have signed
tie agreement and are co-operating in
the Trade Week plans are as follows:

The survey of the result of the great

French territory, exceeding by 15 kilo
meters the territory gained by the
Germans at Verdun. Forty-five vil
lages have fallen before the Allied ar
tillery battering.
A total of 62,000 prisoners, 285 can
nons, half of which are heavy artil

By United Press.
LONDON, Sept. 30. British troops
improved -their positions at the Stuff
redoubt north of Thiepval and beat
off German counter attacks at the
Hessian trench last night, General
Halg reported this evening.
The fighting at the latter place was
very severe, despite a heavy down
pour'of rain that cpnverted the shell-
wrecked trenches into great pools of
mud and water In whihe the Teutons
and Allied legions fought.
The Germans shelled British posi
tions south of the Ancre from Destre-
mont farm to a point southwest of Le
Sars village, toward which Haig's
men are approaching. Despite this
artillery attack the British continued
to Improve their positions on the
whole Thiepval sector.
Renewal of Submarine Crisis Denied.
By United Prenn.
BERLIN, Sept. 30. The American
Embassy and German officials today
drew a damper over the reports of
an approaching new crisis between
the United States and Germany over
the submarine question.
The German statement emphasizes
that the relations between the two
countries are not endangered by the
fact that American volunteer flyers
are serving in the French aviation
corps. The acts of these volunteers
are not considered a breach of neu
trality.
The American Embassy has tele
graphed Swiss journals denying that
Ambassador Gerard is returning to
Washington because German and
American relations are clouding.
Semi-official statements deny that
the Reichstag has decided to return
to the submarine policy.
Yon Faikenhayn Routs Rumanians.
By United Press.

forced southward in disorder. Falken
hyn struck quickly on the left, re
capturing Red Tower pass near the
Transylvania frontier and moving
northward, taking priosners ' and

ed with no definite results.
Led by Villa himself, 300 Villistas
attacked Cusihuirachi Wednesday and
captured the town with little blood
shed. Part of the garrison revolted
and joined Villa. Others were given
an opportunity to join Villa and those
who refused were flogged and sent
to General Trevino. The officers flee

General Ramos, only a few miles
distant.
He immediately attacked the town
with a force of 800 men. Villa hastily
withdrew into the mouth of a nearby

WILSON SOUNDS CALL
TO YOUTH F NATION
President States Reasons for
Re-election and Defines
Issues.
WILL NOT PROPHESY
Tells Young Democrats the
Republican Party Has
Been Provincial.
By United Press. '
SHADOW LAWN, N. J.. Sept, 30.
President Woodrow Wilson today
made the foreign policy of the Unit
ed States a campaign issue when he
warned 3,000 members of the Young
Men's Democratic League that a re
turn, of the Republicans to power
would draw the nation to the brink
of war.
The President urged, all young
Democrats and Progressives, to rally
to ihe Democratic standard. "Our
opponents have found fault with our
foreign policy," said Mr. Wilson.
"They have said It Is all wrong. It
has resulted in peace: therefore it ap
pears that they want war. Some of
the Republicans have even declared
themselves In favor of war," he con
tinued. The Republicans were charged by
the President with representing "in
terests." Their death as a national
party was predicted as a direct re-,
suit of this and other equally serious
faults."
Foreigners Await Election.
"The, fundemental choice of the
American people in regard to the
foreign poliy of this country will oe
made at the polls November 7," said
Wilson. "The officials of the foreign
governments are anxiously awaiting
the election for this reason. It is
up to the voters to say whether the
cuntry shall cntlnue under its present
peaceful Condition through Democrat
ic rule or enter upon a crisis by
changing its political standard."
President Wilson today sounlded a
call to the young men of the country
to join the Democratic party-
The United Press, Is able to an
nounce authoritatively and in detail
on what basis the President believes
he should be returned to office.
He holds that since the administra
tion of Abraham Lincoln, the Repub
lican party has been provincial. It
has. figuratively speaking, believed in
closing up America and having a good
time inside. (
An International Party.
On the other hand, the Democratic
partv, the President will attempt to
show, has- looked outside the house in
which the United States is inclosed.
The President believes he has es
tablished a policy of international in
tercourse, anv change in which might
nrove of vital consequence to the fu
ture peace of the nation.
Tn the President's opinion his? ad
ministration Is an "open book," re
nnirlne; no exnlaitation because it
speake for itself. He believes, how
ever, that the neople if they are asked
n denounce his nollcies will demand
opecific information from Hughes as
to what, the Republican party would
do inuld it be placed in power; what
would be its definite changes in the
tariff: what would be its Dollcv to
ward Mexico and what would it have
done with the Adamson 8-hour law,
"What Would Republicans l)oP
Not what would the Republican
party have done but what would It ex
pect to do now, Is what President Wil
son will ask. ,
The attitude of the administration
nward business has been one of as
sistance, and the resultant unnrece
Hentd prosperity the President means
to show.
As for the results of the commy
eiwtfon. President Wilson at this time
makes no nrediction. He believes
there are many elements going to
make the outcome uncertain. The In
dependent vote, which in his estima
tion will be the greatest the country
has ever known, has the situation in
Its hands. One thing Is certain, that
is. that the President Is not counting
that part of the German vote which
Tie believes It tryinr, to intimidate
him bv its activities in Mieffrent local
elections held to date.
PIar-Radfne CInb to 3Teet Friday.
