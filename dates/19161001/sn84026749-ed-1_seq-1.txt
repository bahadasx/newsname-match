RISE IN FLOUR THE CAUSE
Notice Greets Guests When
They Eat Breakfasts This
Morning.
In line with the policy of hotels In
other cities, and as the result of the
soaring; cost of living, patrons or ai
jeastieast two 01 vnsi.w.iui. -Ins;
hotels the Wlllard and the
Shoroham will have to pay an extra
ohargo of 10 cents per person for
' bread and butter served with their
meals, according to announcement
made today by the managements of
these hotels.
Similar action probably will be taken
by many of the other hotel and res
taurant managements within the next
wtiK or so, according i me wm
ments of Gus Bucholz, proprietor of
the Occodental; the management of
tho Raleigh, and the heads of several
restaurants.
When the patrons of the Wlllard and
Shoreham Hotels picked up menu cards
to order their breakfasts this morning
they found the following notice at
tached thereto:
Owing to the continued rise In the
nrica nf (lour, it has been found
necessary to follow the custom which
has prevailed for some time In the
majority of hotels and restaurants In
ether cities, and make a charge for
bread and butter of 10 cents per
Serson, commencing Monday, Oc
sber. second.
Manager Explains Why.
Robert S. Downs, manager of the
Shoreham, declared that the decision
to make the extra charge far bread
and butter was not taken by the
Washington hotel managements .until
It became obvious that the iotels
"Juat.haArto maksomo ralje to.comn.
out even on foodstuffs served In the
tv i amins; rooms.-
.-va nave ooen aavmoo i nmiwiut.
tho charge until tho last minute," de
clared Mr. Downs," but with flour
I . aelllnc at.flO a barrel and the price
of 60 centa a pound .which We have
to pay per contract for butter, such
a chara-e Is obsolutely necessary.
Mr. Downs explained that while
such a charge was new to Washing
ton It was not In. other cities. He
explained that it had been the custom
of tho leading New Tork hotels to
charge extra for bread nnd butter
for several years, while Philadelphia
and Baltimore hostlerles and the
management of the dining car ser
vices of the country had found It
necessary to charge extra for these
foods within the past several months.
Raleigh May Follow Suit.
While the extra charge for bread and
butter Is not now In effect at the Raleigh,
an official of that hotel said today that
the probability is that It will be before
the week Is over.
"We had the extra charge announced
somo days ago. but eliminated it," said
this official. "Wo have been somewhat
undecided about putting the charge Into
effect again, and realize that we will
have to do so very soon owing to the
cost of flour and butter." ,
Qua Buchols. of the Occidental, ex
plained that the extra charge had not
been decided on at his establishment,
nor at several other of tho leading res
taurants In the downtown section. Mr.
Bucholz declared, however, that the res.
taurant and hotel keepers all realized
that "sbmethlng must be done in order
that meals will not be servkd at a loss
instead of at a profit."
. Habits of Patrons.
One hotel proprietor. In discussing tho
bread and butter situation, explained
that nine out of ten persons who bit
down at the tables of his hotel for a
meal usually eat an order of bread and
butter beforo their meal Is served. '
"Let us say this meal Is break
fast." this hotel manager explained,
"and the patron orders two soft boiled
eggs, fruit, and coffee. It Is served
fnr as or 40 cents, or near that flguro.
Count two orders of bread and butter
served without cnargo wn me mcai
and see where the hotel comes out.
with flniir selling: at $10 a barrel and
butter at Its present price. There In
nothing left for us to do but charge
extra for these foods."

tho Secretary, said, which will report
In December as to the ne wbulldlngs
necessary to house the Increased corps
of cadets, and Congress will then bo
asked to make tho necessary appropria

new buildings necessary to accommo
date the new cadctn.
