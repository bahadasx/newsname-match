LONDON, Sept. 30. Troops of thelgjn immediately.
Central Powers have crushed the Ku
manians between two forces In a bat
tle which raged for three days In cen
tral Transylvania. The Rumanians
are reported fleeing in disorder.
General Von Falkenhayn, attacking
the Rumanians, divided his force of
Germans and Austrlans. One body
engaged them around Hermannstadt,
the other encircled them and seized
Rothenburg Pass, fifteen miles south
east of Hermannstadt, and one of the
first points gained by the Rumanians
in their advance.
Both forces then pressed in upon
the Rumanians. Bavarian troops hold
in Rothenbere checked an advance
by the second Rumanian army, which j.
attempted to come to the aid or us
surrounded compatriots, and almost
wiped them out. Berlin reports that
a large amount of booty was taken,
as well as. prisoners.
In eastern Transylvania the Ru
manians attack in he region of Szeke
ly was checked and a German attack
in the same section resulted in the
capture of 600 prisoners.
Somme Unchanged
Fighting continues on the Somme
front, but with little change in the
positions. Germans continue their
counter attacks around Thiepval.
Farther south the French have made
'an advance north of Rancourt, driv
ing their wedge n the German lines
there. Berlin reports the repulse of
British attacks on this front
1 ' . British Lose 300,000
' During September the British on
the Somme lost almost 120,000 officers
and men. This is at the rate of 3S00
a day, but falls below the daily human
cost for August. Since the offensive
began, figures published in London
show that the British have lost ap
proximately 300,000 men. .
' The Overseas News Agency an
nounces that it is stated on "com
petent authority", that Germany has
reached no new decision concerning
submarine warfare. The i statement

FIRE PREVENTION
DAY CELEBRATED IN
- BISBEE OCTOBER 9
Day Is Set Apart for Proper
Remembrance of America's
Greatest Conflagration and
Better Protection.
One week from tomorrow the state
Of Arizona, through proclamation of
the governor and through the interest
of the various city governments any
many organizations will celebrate its
first Fire Prevention Dav. It is the
anniversary of the great Chicago fire i
and, odd as it may appear, a practical I
anniversary of the worst fire which '
ever occurred in Bisbee.
On October 14, 1908, fire broke out
in the Grand HVitel, one of Bisbee'"
land marks on Main Street. Fire was
an unusual thing in the camp and
various elements entered into - the
blaze to the extent that a large por
tion of the thoroughfare's important
blocks and many on the side of Claw
son Hill were burned to the ground.
Since then Bisbee and the Warren
District has had several bad fires.
They are to be remembered. Fire Pre
vention Day, celebrated annually. Is
Vne of the factors which is being
instituted with the American people
to instaill inherent desire for the pro
tection of all property from the rav
ages of useless fire.
Agitation for a Fire Prevention Dav
was started in Bisbee. Fire Chief
Norton, in a signed article in the Re
view May 12, 1908, called attention,
among other things relating to the
general subject, Vo the need for some
day to be set apart which would draw
the attention of tiie public to the need
for greater care to the protection of
their homes and other property.
From that point it has grown until
the state of Arizona recognizes it,
along with nearly every other state
in the Union. The idea is not claimed
by the Bisbee man but it was be who
first advanced its possibilities to the
local public.
Fire, every year in the United
States, consumes an enormous total.
The values represented in the houses,
stocks, furniture, etc., destroyed can
never be returned. It is sheer waste.
The proportionate loss in Europe to
l tal value Is far less than in the

experts, have been Incessantly at the
task Of reducing Cre loss. They have
studied out the best methods of fight-!

'determined the best forms of fire proof

human equation for the surest and
best solution of the entire matter. The
fire experts of the country are now
going after the ordinary man and
woman. That is the object of Fire
Prevention Day b wakening in John
Smith his responsibility to himself and
his neighbors and to his country of.
the necessity of reducing fire loss to
a minimum.
The city authorities of Bisbee, in
their action Friday night, buying fire
apparatus Of the most modern charac
ter, gave a long step in this direction
and by that example are betting for
every man and woman in the city the
first idea of modern American life
conservation.

(By Review Leased Wire)
BUFFALO. N. Y., Sept. 30. Charles
E. Hughes, in speeches at Jamestown
late today and here tonight, assailed
the administration for its attitude to
ward the development of American
business. Mr. Hughes cited the fail
ure 'of American bankers ,to obtain
government support of their plan to
participate in the proposed six power
loan to China, and the administration's
Mexican policy, in support of his at-
tack.
Would He Intervene?
It is said by the administration
that they desire to open the dctor for
American enterprise," Mr. Hughes
said. "What is the inducement for
our merchants and business men to
go to foreign countries and engage in
American enterprise if they and their
investments are treated as our citizens
and their property were permitted to
be treated in Mexico?"
One Side of China Deal.
Proposed participation by American
bankers in the foan to China was
characterized by Mr. Hughes as "a
matter of great moment to the nation
because it permitted an opportunity
to aid China, to further our trade.
"We lost an important opportunity
for American trade," Mr. Hughes said,
I believe that more recently the ad
ministration has seen the error that
it committed in this respect but it has
failed tt re-establish confidence in the
protection of American enterprises."
Mr. Hughes' assertions were inter
preted by persons in the audiences as
being in the nature of a reply to Presi
dent Wilson's recent declarations at
Baltimore, outlining the administra
tion's views toward the future devel
opment of American trade abroad.
Mr. Hughes renewed his attack on
the administration for broken pledges.
"They told us," he said, "that they
were going to maintain the constitu
tional rights of American citizens
throughout the world. That they have
failed to do, to our great regret Our
opponents have a great jealousy as
they have said in times past with re
gard to the facilities lor American
enterprises and the advance of Ameri
can trade. These are matters of the
highest importance to all our people

Eieht Hour Day Attitude, the
Handling of Mexican and

"Humiliating and Ignoble."
(By Review Leased Wire)
BATTLE CREEK, Mich., Sept. 30.
Speaking to a great throng of persons
who were packed in a cold circus tent
Iiere th:s afternoon, Theodore Roose
velt assailed the administration rec
ord of President Wilson and urged
the election of Chas. E. Hughes. He
was given a tremendous ovation.
Climbing on a table on the speakers'
platform, the Colonel read his pre
pared address, which, was devoted al
most entirely to an attack on Presi
dent Wilson's foreign and Mexican
policies; and the latter's support of
the Adamson 8 hour bill. 1
Wilson Changes Mind
Roossvelt declared that Presi
dent Wilson's chief policy was the
policy of vacillation. He declared
the President, in "fifteen messag
es and speeches,' made from De
cember 9, 1914, to February 10,
1916, "took 41 different positions
ab v.it preparedness and the meas
ures necessary to rcure it, and
each of these 41 positions contra
dicted from one to six of the oth
ers." The Lusitania "Outrage"
The European policy of President
Wilson, particularly in the Lusitania
case, was referred to as "humiliating
and Ignoble." . , 1
All About Mexico
Tl Mexican record of the execu
tive was called "ruinous to Mexico,
dishonorable to ourselves and infam
ous from the standpoints of humanity.
Discussing the Adamson bill, Mr.
Roosevelt charged that President Wil
son in urging the passage of the meas
ure by congress, "took his order from
that one of the parties he most fear
ed." "We have seen in this country few
things more discreditable to our au
thority and more ominous for the fu
ture of the nation than the spectacle
of the President and Congress of the
United States being required to pass
a certain bill at the dictation of cer
tain men who sat in the gallery with
their watches in their hands, threaten
ing ruin and destruction to the nation
if there was the smallest failure to
satisfy their demands," said Roose
velt German Masterpiece
The Colonel referred to the torpe
doing of the Lusitania by a German
submarine as "the most colossal sin
gle instance of the murder of non
combatants, including men, women
and children that had been perpetrat
ed by any power calling itself civil
ized, for over a century."

Charges that the Democratic pledge
of economy in government had been

ance without a parallel were made by
Charles W. Fairbanks, in two' address
es here today.
"Its appropriations and expenditures
have been made recklessly and in de
fiance of every economical considera

waste of public funds, that the strong
est Democratic leadership denounced
it on the flo'jr of Congress. The river

approved by the Congress carries forty
million' dollars. It was designed to
strengthen candidates for Congress,
for the safe return of these to Con

WASHINGTON, Sept 30. Increas
ing agitation in Germany for a com
plete resumption of submarine war
fare. Chancellor von Bethmann-Holl-weg's
declaration before the Reichstag
that any statesman failing to use Ger
many's every weapon to shorten the
war deserves to be hanged, and the
recent apparently inspired simultan
eous publication in German papers of
attacks on American neutrality,
brought forth today an authoritative
though informal statement from the
department of state of the American
attitude toward the situation.
Any act ton which endangers Ameri
can lives through the sinking of ships
without warning or by failing to pro
vide proper safeguards, it was em
phatically asserted, will immediately
reopen the submarine question with
all its possibilities.
Germany Playing Fair.
But so far as to what is going on
In Germany, there has been absolutely
no Indication In the' official advices
that Germany has -violated the agree
ment arrived at in the Sussex case.
Reports of the sinking of nearly 300
merchant' ships since June. 1 have
been received officially, but in no
case has it been proved that Ameri
can lives were endangered.
High officials think it unnecessary
to make any formal statement on the
subject as they feel the American
position is fully known both at home
and abroad. However, the possibili
ties which a change bf Germany's
policy might open are so great that
every effort will be made to have a
full understanding on all sides.
AH dispatches received here by
diplomats are described as clearly in
dicating that Germany intends fully
to live up to her assurances. It is
acknowledged that there is consider
able opposition in Germany to this
policy. But so far as is known here
the 'opposition to the government's
policy Is no stronger than before.

(By Review Leased Wire)
LONG BRANCH, N. J., Sept 30.
In a vogorous denunciation of the
Republican party. President Wil
son today told a delegation of
young Democrats from New York
that "the certain prospect" of Re
publican success in November is
that "we shall be drawn in one
form or another Into the embroil
ments of the European war," and
that "the force of the United
States will be used to produce in
Mexico the kind of law and order
which some investors in Mexico
think most to their advantage."
The President made his first
out and out political speech of the
campaign from the porch of Sha
dow Lawn. Urged on by the en
thusiastic cheers and waving ban
ners of several thousand young
men, he assaulted the Republican
party and laid down the issues
on which he believes the cam
paigns should be fought
Foreign Relations Blocked.
Still discussing the foreign affairs
of the country he stated that on ac
count of the political uses made of

administration to handle any critical
matter concerning our foreign rela
tions, because all foreign statesmen
are waiting to see which way the
election goes, and in the meantime
they know that settlements would be
inconclusive.
Befriends Bull Moose.
Most jf the President's address was
devoted to criticisms of the Republi
can party and to outlining his own
plans. A bid was made by the Presi
dent for the votes of Progressives. He
praised the Progressive party as hav
ing "the real red blood of human
sympathy in its veins," and declared
the Democratic party had dene the
things the Progressives wanted dtme.
Meddling of Hyphenates.
Briefly the President referred to the
hyphenate issue. He said:
"Back of that party (the Republi
cans) are those who want to inject
into our politics the politics of Eur
ope." Outlining the program of the
Democratic party. Mr. Wilson said it
has begun the pi'jcess of "liberaliza
tion" for the business of this country,
and "it intends to strengthen that sys
tem at every point, extend it at every
point extending it wherever it needs
extension."
"No thoughtful man In this country
would propose that we should return
to the methods of political control
practiced by Senator Hanna. It hap
pened that at that time a very lovely
trustworthy gentleman was president
of the United States. I mean Mr. Wm.
McKinley. He had no part discredi
table to himself, so far as I know, in
the political arrangements and the ex
penditure of unlimited money, but
now you will notice we have returned
to the good old days of Mark Hanna
in the Republican party.
"Some of the very gentlemen who
were prominent in that odious regime
are now at the head of the affairs of
