Foreign Statesmen. Says President,
Are Waiting to See Which Way
Election Goes.
LONG BRANCH. N. J.. September SO.
?In a vigorous denunciation of the republican
party, President Wilson today
told a delegation of young democrats
from New York that "the certain prospect"
of republican success in November
is that "we shall be drawn in one form
or another into the embroilments of European
war," and that "the force of the
United States will be used to produce in
Mexico the kind of law and order which
ome investors in Mexico consider most
to their advantage."
The President made his first out-andout
political speech of the campaign
from the porch of Shadow Lawn. Urged i
on by the enthusiastic cheers and waving
banners of several thousand young
men. he assailed the republican party
and laid down the issues on which he
believes the campaign should be fought.
Expects Change of Foreign Policy.
"Am I not right that we must draw
the conclusion that if the republican
party is put into power at the next
election our foreign policy will be radically
changed?" he asked. "I cannot
draw any other inference. All our present
foreign policy is wrong, they say, and
if it is wrong, and they are men of
conscience, they must change it. And
if they are going to change it, in what
direction are they going to change it?
There is only one choice as against
peace, and that is war."

counsel of "those who have hitherto
acted as the counsellors of the vested
Interests in Mexico," the President
declared that these men had tried to
get what they wanted from him. but
had failed and "now are going where
they think they can get it."
Foreign Statesmen Watching.
Still discussing the foreign affairs of j
the country. President Wilson stated j
that on account of the political uses !
made of foreign relations, "It is going j
to be practically impossible for the !
present administration to handle any
critical matter concerning our foreign
relations, because all foreign statesmen
are waiting to see which way the election
goes, and in the meantime they
know th$Vsettlements would be tncliulra'^.g&
Most President's address was
devoted to criticisms of the republican
patty and in outlining his own plans.
In front and below hfm were young
democrats who came here from New
York on- special trains and marched
with bands playing and banners waving
more than a mile to Shadow Lawn.
Frequently he was forced to stop
speaking for several minutes while the
applause lasted.
A bid was made by the President for
the votes of progressives. He praised
the progressive party as having "the,
real red blood of human sympathy In
its veins," and declared the democratic
party had done the things the progressives
wanted done.
Refers to Hyphenate Issue.
Briefly, the President referred to the
hyphenate issue. He said: "Back of
that party (the republican) are those
who want to inject Into our politics
the politics of Europe."
A grain attacking the republican party,
he said lieutenants of Mark Hanna
have returned to authority and determine
the policy of the republican
party.
Outlining the program of the democratic
party, Mr. Wilson said it has begun
the processes of "liberalization"
for the business of this country, and
"it intends to strengthen that system
at every point, extend it at every point,
extend it wherever it needs extension."
He referred briefly to the federal reserve
act, the tariff commission act, the
trade commission act and other laws
passed by the democrats, charging that
"until the present administration Wall
street controlled the actions of the
Treasury of the United States."
President's Appeal to Young- Men.
Resident Wilson's address to the
young men's democratic clubs at Shadow
Lawn today was as follows:
*T am very much obliged to you for
giving me an opportunity to say some
very plain tilings about the present
campaign and about the future policy
of this country, because young men are
very much more Interested In the future
than they are in the present. While
some of us who are older look back
upon long experience and are able to
take certain measurements which may
not have occurred to you. nevertheless
k your feeling is that the world lies in
front of you and not behind you. You
want to know what sort of world It is
going to be and what sort of guidance
you are going to have in that world,
and what sort of co-operation among
you will be effective for the service of
the world Into which the years ahead
of you will bring you.
'T do not know' where, from republican
quarters, you have got any suggestions
as to what is going to happen
in the years to come. This is a most
singular campaign. I will not say an
unprecedented campaign, because I
happen to remember that other parties
have tried to get into power by saying
nothing whatever; and I remember
with Interest that they never succeeded.
because the people of the United
States arft an innnlsifiwo > **
If you ask them to intrust you with
the great power of their government,
they really want to know what you
are going to do with that government
if they intrust you with it. They may
not insist upon your telling them what
you would have done in circumstances
now past and gone, but they will insist
upon your telling them what you
intend to do in the future.
Expected Intellectual Contest.
"For & little while I myself expected
that this campaign would be an
interesting intellectual contest; that
on both sides men would draw upon
ome of the essential questions of
politics In order to determine the predominance
of parties, but I am sorry
to say I have found nothing to Interest
me, and Vam a little bit ashamed
of myself that I should have expected
It. for I should have known better.

political history of which I ought to

President Wilson Mild:
Back of the republican party are
those who want to Inject here
politics of Europe.
Democratic party has begrun
process of liberalization for business
of country.
Col. Roosevelt said:
| Washington and Lincoln put
I duty first, not safety first: ac
cepted war rather than unrighteous
and disastrous peace.
President established shameful
precedent in eight-hour day, that
government can be coerced, and
legislation extorted from Con
gress by terrorization.
Candidate Hughe* said:
The administration has failed
to maintain rights of United
States citizens abroad.
It is regrettable that partisan expediency
should be gratified at
expense of diplomatic intercourse.

ATTITUDE OF PRESIDENT
"HUMILIATING, IGNOBLE"
Attacks Foreign Policy, Eight-Hour
Legislation and Calls Executive
Vacillating.
BATTLE CREEK, Mich., September
30.?Speaking to an audience which
filled a huge circus tent here this afternoon.
Theodore Roosevelt assailed the
administrative record of President Wilson
and urged the election of Charles
E. Hughes.
When the former President entered
the tent to make his first Michigan
speech on behalf of the republican can- j
didate for President^ he was given a !
wild ovation. Roosevelt swept Michigan
in the presidential election four '
years ago. ;
Climbing on a table on the speakers'
platform, the colonel read his prepared I
address. It was devoted almost en
tirely to an attack on* President Wilson's
foreign and Mexican policies and 1
the latter's support of the Adaraion 1
eight-hour day bill.
Policy of Vadllatloa.
. Roosevelt declared that President :
Wilson's chief policy waa- the policy
of vacillation. He declared the President,
in "fifteen messages, letters and
speeches," made from December 9, 1914, ;
to February 10, 1916, "took forty-one
different positions about preparedness
and the measures necessary to secure
it, and each of these forty-one positions
contradicted from one to six of
the others."
The European policy of President
Wilson, particularly in the Lusitania
case, was referred to as "humiliating
and ignoble." The Mexican record of !
the executive was called "ruinous to
Mexico, dishonorable to ourselves and
infamous from the standpoint, of humanity."
Discussing the Adamson bill, Mr.
Roosevelt charged that President Wilson,
in urging passage of the measure
by Congress, "took his orders from
that one of the parties which he most
feared."
"We have seen in this country few
things more discreditable to our representatives
and more ominous for the future
of the nation," said Mr. Roosevelt,
"than the spectacle of the President
and Congress of the United States
being required to pass a certain bill
before a certain hour at the dictation of
certain men. who sat in the gallery with
their watches In their hands, threatening
ruin and disaster to the nation if there
was the smallest failure to satisfy their
demands."
If Roosevelt Were President.
The colonel referred to the torpedoing
of the Lusltanla by a German submarine,
as "the most colossal single instance
of the murder of non-combatants,
including men. women and children, that
had been perpetrated by any power calling
Itself civilised, for over a century."
"I have been asked what I would
have done if I had been President when
the Lusltanla was torpedoed/' shouted
the speaker. "I would instantly have
taken possession of every German ship
Interned In this country and then I
would have said: "Now, we will discuss,
not what we will give, but what
we will give back.*" This utteranoe received
wild applause.
When he began his attack on the
Adamson bill. Col. Roosevelt declared
that an Increase of wages and not the
eight-hour day was the real issue.
"Let President Wilson apply that sacred
eight-hour day law to the servants
J in the White House and see how far
he'll get," said Roosevelt. "I believe in
j the eight-hour day as the general rule
! toward which we must strive, but I
! recognize that special needs must be
! met in special industries, and that in
I all such cases there must be a very
( careful consideration of ail the condi
lions ufliorc unai anivii in mnoii.
Pleads for Hughes' Election.
Roosevelt closed his address with a
plea for the election of Charles E.
Hughes. eH urged the voters to "repu
diate Mr. Wilson, because only by so
, doing can they save America from that
! taint of gross selfishness and cowardice
i which we owe to Mr. Wilson's substitutions
of adroit elocution for straighti
forward action."
j The circus tent was crowded, and
J thousands were massed around It long
i before Col. Roosevelt arrived. He
j started speaking at 4:10 o'clock. Sev|
era! speakers preceded the colonel.
Former Senator Lafayette Young of
: Iowa discussed national politics, but
broke off his speech sharply when the
crowd, ipeemingly restless, began to
cry: "We want Teddy."
Mr. Young. In his speech, said Col.
Roosevelt told him last December at
Oyster Bay that he would support
Hughes for President If the latter were
nominated.
United States Senator Charles IS.
Townsend of Michigan, Representative
Patrick H. Kelley of Michigan, and
Ralph Cole of Ohio also spoke.

CITES THE CHINESE LOAN
AS "LOST OPPORTUNITY"
Reiterates in Buffalo Speech That
American Interests Abroad Are
Without Protection.
BUFFALO, September 30.?Charles E.
Hughes, In speeches at Jamestown late
today and here tonight, assailed the
administration for its attitude toward
the development of American business
abroad. Mr. Hughes cited the failure
of American bankers to obtain government
support of their plan to partlcl
pdiC III 111C piujjuocu OIA j/wnci loan
to China, and the administration's
Mexican policy, in sppport of his attack,.
"It is said by the administration that
they desire to open the door for
American enterprise," Mr. Hughes said.
"What is the inducement for our merchants
and business men to go to foreign
countries and engage in American
enterprises if they and their investments
are treated as our citizens and
their property were permitted to be
treated in Mexico?"
Proposed participation by American
bankers in the loan to China was characterized
by Mr. Hughes as "a matter
of great moment to the nation because
it permitted an opportunity not
only to aid China, but to facilitate our
trade."
Important Opportunity Lost.
"We lost an important opportunity
for American trade," Mr. Hughes said.
"I believe that more recently the administration
has seen the error that it
committed in this respect, but it has
failed to re-establish confidence with
regard to its protection of American
enterprise."
Mr. Hughes' assertions were interpreted
by persons in his audience as
being in the nature of a reply to
President Wilson's recent declarations
m oiiaau w uawii anu ueivic a giain
Sealers' convention at Baltimore, outlining
the administration's views
toward the future development of
American trade abroad.
Mr. Hughes renewed his attack on the
administration for "broken pledges."
"They told us," he said, "they were
going to maintain the constitutional
rights of American citizens throughout
the world. 'That they have failed to
do, to our great regret. When I
speak of this record I speak of it not
in disparagement oil words. As a
raM administration, undoubtedly the
present administration has been most
jtfeuyjpp B'ftt we desire performance.
Faces
Toward the Future.
"The republican party is an agency of
progress. Our faces are toward the future.
but we are inspired by the past.
"Our opponents have a great deal to
say now, as they have said in times
past, with regard to the facilities for
American enterprise and the principles
of American trade. These are matters
of the highest importance to all our
people, and we inquire in order to test
the professions and promises that are
given with respect to the record that
has been made in the past.
"Take, for example, the matter of the
six-power loan to China. There was an
opportunity obtained by which our
bankers could share to the extent of
one-sixth in the proposed loan. It was
a matter of great nfoment to the nation
because it permitted an opportunity not
only to aid China, but to facilitate our!
- /I" T waa (mnnrtnnt to Th#? notion I
that we should have a fair relation to
the advantages of trade with China In
the future.
"But when the present administration
came into power and these bankers
asked whether they would hare
the co-operation and protection of the
administration, they were informed In
effect that the administration did not
desire them to continue. We lost an
Important opportunity for American
trade.
"I, believe that more recently the administration
has seen the error that
it committed in that respect, but it
has failed to re-establish confidence
with regard to its protection of American
enterprises.
Relatione to Latin America.
"We hear a good deal with regard
to our relations to Latin America.
Those relations are of the utmost importance;
they should be based on mutual
confidence and esteem, and everything
should be done to bring us Into
an Intimate exchange of benefits. But
what was the adtlon of the administration
with respeot to Latin America?
It withdrew man after man from the :
nations in Latin America who was a
trained diplomat, well known for his
experience and special fitness. In order J
to supply places and meet the demands j
of partisan expediency.
"It is a most regrettable thing that!
anywhere mere -partisan expediency1
should be gratified at the expense of
the diplomatic intercourse of our nation.
We cannot afford in the future
to have men of second or third or
fourth rate take the place of men who
are known to have given many years
in faithful diplomatic Intercourse and
have acquired experience and training
of the greatest value to this country.
Serious Side to Mexican Matter.
"There is a very serious side to the
Mexican matter. I am looking at it
for the moment in connection with
those promises relating to the expan- |
sion and development of American
trade. We have heard criticised those
who naa laKen advantage 01 opportunities
and made Investments In Mexico.
but I have not discovered that any
line was drawn between the Innocent,
and those who were not permitted to be
Innocent In permitting our cltlsens to be
left to the ravages of revolution and perhaps
to he destroyed.
"If any have forfeited their rights
under International law. let them be
singled out and dealt with. But I
stand here to assert that American
trade will not be maintained according
to the ambitions and Just aspirations of
our people, and we shall not stand before

esteem and the confidence of
the nation, unless we protect, at all

Much Ado in State of Illinois
Regarding Attitude in
Politics.
BY N. O. MESSENGEB.
CHICAGO. September 30.?In another
column you will read whatjpurports to
be the real political news of this aectlon
of the country?Col. Roosevelt's
speech at Battle Creek and his attack
! upon President Wilson?but do not be
misled. That Is not the real sensation
of the hour; here It is:
Judge Thomas P. Scully of the county
court here has ruled that woman voters
need not state their age when registering.
Now, wait a minute, and
don't pass this up as negligible. Women
are voting for the presidency in
Illinois for the first time this year, and
this ruling of Judge Scully's may bring
out a hundred thousand more woman
votes, and If Illinois should be a pivotal
state, perhaps this additional vote
might?why, can't you see the possibilities
of it? Anyhow, it is the big
news of the day in the feminist camp,
as The Star's correspondent is informed.
and so he duly, reports it.
There is much ado just at present over
how the women are going to vote, or,
rather. In what way will they be influenced
in exercising their right of
suffrage. For the first time they are
to have the right of going forth from
their homes and having just as much
to say about who shall be President as
that "big bluffer across the street," by
way of simile.
Opinions of the Situation.
Rare are opinions voiced today:
"Women are not voting In groups,
but according to individual convictions/*
said Miss Harriet B. Vlttum.
chairman for Illinois of the woman's
committee of the National Hughes Alllanoe.
"The suffragists who did so
much to win the vote for Illinois are
now using It as they should use it?as
their own thoughts teach them to do.
They are, moreover, making every sort
of sacrifice to do what they can. Women
who will vote for Hughes are holding
meetings in their homes, speaking
at other meetings, volunteering their
services, and doing the first thing that
comes to hand."
That is one side. Now hearken to another:
"Women are not appealed to by spectacular
political stunts, and as suffragists
who have argued for the equality
of the politically oppressed they will
stand for the common people's candidate,"
declared Mr6. Antoinette Funk,
chairman of the Illinois branch of the
Wilson progressive campaign committee.
"Suffragists vote as they see their
home and their families will profit by [
their ballot, not through inherited political
ties." |
Members of the Congressional Union j
for Woman Suffrage, though possess
ins? no preference for any candidate, I
are. however, committed to doing their I
part at the polls to defeat Wilson for
re-election.
Bays Mr. Wilson Failed Them.
"Mr. Wilson represents the party
which has had It In Its power to push
the federal amendment for woman suffrage,
and has failed to do so," said
Mrs. Abby Soott Baker, ihalrman for
Illinois of the union's activities in the
suffrage states. "We. therefore, being
conoerned first of all in enfranchising
women, will do what we can to defeat
him and his party."
The Illinois Equal Suffrage Association
and the Chicago Poltloal Equality
League, two large non-partisan suffrage
organisations, are Indorsing the
candidacy of no candidate.
Judge Scully's ruling that women
need pot giro their age In registering
has been printed by the political managers
and widely circulated to encourage
the woman voters to oeme out and

"and took the magasine out.
While 1 was fooling with it I heard it
go off. but did not know which way
the bullet went. I put the pistol In my
pocket and walked to Main street,
when I felt a burning sensation in my
side, and, looking down, saw the blood
running down my leg.
"A man in an automobile, who was
Mr. Cunningham, came laong. When I
told him I was hurt he took me to the
hospital."
An operation was performed on the
little sufferer last night in the hope of
saving his life. He had a fairly good

CHEAPER GAS RATES
TO GO INTO EFFECT
\
Beginning Today, Washington
Users Will Pay 75 Cents
Per 1,000 Feet.
Beginning today Washington users
of gas east of Rock creek will pay at
the rate of 75 cents per thousand cubic
feet, while gas users In the territory
served by the Georgetown Gas Company
will pay at the rate of 85 cents per
thousand cubic feet. The new rates
fixed by Congress become effective beginning
today.
Officers of the Washington Gas Light
Company and of the Georgetown Gas
Company yesterday stated neither of
the companies would appeal to the
courts for possible relief from the new
rates.
Statements of Companies.
At the office of President Weaver of
the Georgetown company the following
statement was made:
"Today is the final day for dollar gas
in Georgetown. Beginning tomorrow
the new rate of 85 cents will be made
effective. The Georgetown Gas Company
does not intend to appeal to the
courts for injunction and does not purpose
to resist in any way the application
of the new rate. This company will
charge at the rate of 85 cents for its
gas pending final determination by the
public utilities commission of the value
of its plant, etc."
Howard S. Reeside, president of the
Washington Gas Light Company, said
that company would make no effort to
resist by legal proceedings the application
of the new rate of 75 cents, at
whioh Congress directed Its gas should
be sold. "This 'company," he said, **will
obey the law and will not ask for poa- ,
sible relief at the hands of the courts.
The new rate will be put into effect October
1 and will remain in effect at \
least until the valuation of the com- i
pany*s properties is completed and the
findings of the public utilities commis- j
sion are announced."
Consolidation Is Possible. I
Amalgamation of the Washington
and Georgetown Gas Light oompanles

utilities commission in establishing
valuations for these concerns.
Apparently authentic information ia
to the effect that the Georgetown
company Is willing to dispose of its ,
holdings at a reasonable price, and
that the coming together of the com- <
panies, under certain conditions, would .
receive the official "O. K." of the utilities
commission.
When asked last night as to what J
might be the attitude of the commis- ]
sion in the matter, Commissioner
Newman stated that, personally, he
would favor such amalgamation, provided
it was based on a fair valuation i
and would not lead to an increase in
rates.
He stated that the commission practically
has concluded with the gas com- '
pany tentative valuations, and that if '
the corporations wish to combine they 1
can facilitate matters by co-operating <
with the commission in establishing '
the final valuations. * J
No Opposition Likely.
Commissioner Newman eaid that
while he was not authorized to apeak J
for the rest of the commission, he felt 1
sure there would be so opposition to a i
combine under conditions suggested. ,
One of the reasons urged in favor of 1
the consolidation, it is said, is that 1
overhead charges can be reduced, 1
which in turn will make possible a 1
reduction in tha?prio? of gas. This t
reduction probably will be effective at |
the outset, it is said. In the form of a \

MATES VIEWS
OF U-BOATWAfiFARE
State Department Informally
Warns Germany Not to
Endanger American Uvea.
COMMENT ON AGITATtON
FOR REVIVAL OF METHOD
Confidence Expressed, However, That
the Teuton Government "Will Bespect
Agreement of Beoord.
Increasing agitation In Oeratanr tor
& complete resumption of submarine
warfare, Chancellor von BethmannHollweg*s
declaration before the reloh8tagr
that any statesman falling to use
3ermany*? every weapon to shorten
the war "deserves to be hanged," and
the recent apparently inspired simultaneous
publication In German papers
of attaoks on American neutrality,
brought forth yesterday an authoritative,
though Informal, statement
from the State Department of the
American government's attitude toward
the situation.
Any action which endangers American
lives through the sinking of ships
without warning, or by failing to provide
proper safeguards, it was emphatically
asserted, will immediately
reopen the submarine question with all
its possibilities. But as yet, in spite
of what is going on in Germany,
there has been absolutely no indication
in the official advices to the department
that Germany has violated
the agreement arrived at in the Sussex
c$se.
No American Dives Endangered.
Reports of the sinking of 162 ships
since June 1 have been received officially,
but in no case has it been
proved that American lives were endangered.
Until suoh proof !e at hand
the situation will remain Just as it
has been slnoe May 8, when the American
reply was sent accepting Ger
many s repudiation, offer of reparation
and assurances for the future In the
Sussex case.
High officials think It unnecessary
to make any formal statement on the
subject, as they feel It Is fully known
to both this country and Germany. No
opposition was expressed, however, to
a restatement of the government's
position. The possibilities which a
change of Germany's policy might
open up are so great that every effort
will be made to have a full understanding
on all sides.
Emphatic denials that Germany has
any intention of reopening a relentless
campaign of submarine warfare are
contained in confidential advloes from
Berlin to diplomatic quarters here.
All dispatches received by diplomats
friendly to the Teutonic allies are described
as clearly indicating that Germany
intends fully to live up to her
assurances.
It is acknowledged that there Is considerable
opposition in Germany to this
policy of the government, and that a
strong party is urging the more liberal
use of the undersea weapon. The situation
Is not a new one, and so far as is
known here the opposition to the government's
policy is no stronger now than
before.
Cause for Anxiety.
ao isr as American omciais are concerned
the recent agitation In Germanyhas
caused various degrees of anxiety.
Some see in it merely the bitter demonstrations
of a party out of power, whose
exact strength is not known, but which
Is thought not to be powerful enough
to overthrow the chancellor, committed
against illegal submarine warfare. The
chancellor's latest speech is not interpreted
in such quarters as foreshadowing
his conversion to ruthless submarine activity,
for it is pointed out that he may
well hold that Germany is now gaining all
that can possibly be gained from her
submarine weapon.
Others, however, are inclined to take
the opposite view, believing that the
chancellor has been won over to the
von Tirpitz party. They point out that
with the gradual crunching In of the
German lines and the increased realization
that England is the super-enemy,
pressure in Germany will become irresistible
to strike in every possible way.
Gerard. Not Summoned Home.
It was reiterated again yesterday that
Ambassador Gerard, now on his way to
the United States for a vacation, had
not been summoned home from Berlin to
discuss the submarine or any other issue,
snd that if any crisis were at hand or
expected, he would under no circumstances
be allowed to leave his post. It
Is admitted that as a matter of course
be will give the department fuller information
on all matters of interest than he
oould by mail.
