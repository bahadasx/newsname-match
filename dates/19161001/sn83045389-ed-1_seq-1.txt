your feeling is that the world lies in

"I do not know where, from Ke

suggestions as to what is going to

a innst singular campaign. I will not
any an unprecedented campaign, be
cause 1 happen to remember that other

lii the absence of full report* from
the several departments which admin
istrate their own special funds, it was
not pessible yesterday io prepare a

yea* the true balance was ti'*?.*?.?; 1 2 less
than the 1m.ok balance struck i.v the
Allditoi s of'ice at the close of business

will ptobably be the same variation.
The showing of the first book balance
since the release by the State of the

State tax oiltcials yesterday as en
couraging in the highest ilegi-ce. It
allayed definitely .the gradually van

of Kecords have already reported vol
untary returns of omitted intangible
property valued at 550,ftrtrt.rt0n, from

lect ed.
Large revenue increases are expected
from the new franchise taxes, especial
ly in view of the fact that the gross
C-'iMiiiiifs of railway companies, upon
which this tax is levied, have increased
enormously since the last taxinu period.
Increases in revenue from the mer
chants' license tax and tin- inheritance
tax, as well as from the normal en
hancement in value of the regular lax
subjects segregated Jo the Stale, it is
believed, will more than wipe, out the
disability created by the release of
the real estate tax. A real estate levy
of l.i cents on the $101) is still made by
the State for school purposes.

The defeat of tho Roumanians was
brought about by a strategic move
virtually impossible on tho western

divided his forces of Germans and
Aust ro-Hitngarians. While one body
engaged the \nvaders around Hermann-'

manians and seized Rothenthurm Pass,
in the mountains (iftoon miles south

liist points gained liv tho Roumanians
in their advance.
Itoth forces then pressed in upon the

army, which attempted to come to the
aid of its surrounded compatriots,

booty was taken as well as prisoners.
In Kastorn Transylvania the Rou
