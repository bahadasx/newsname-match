McArthur Claims Only Duly
Elected Members May Vote
In Committee
CASE SEEMS TO BE ONE
THAT MAY PROVE PUZZLE
No Precedent In Law Or In Jndi
cial Proceedure So Far
As Yet Known
That Fred McLean was not elected
chairman of the Democratic state cen­
tral committee by the votes of a ma­
jority of the members of that body,
is the contention urged before the
supreme bench yesterday by attor­
neys for D. H. McArthur, Democratic
candidate for governor, who would
oust Mr. McLean from his high seat.
McArthur's attorneys contend fur­
ther that McLean is not eligible for
the chairmanship because he is not
a member of the state central com­
mittee.
Question of Proxies.
Whether a proxy entitles the hold
er to full membership powers is the
question before the court. McArthur
sets forth that but twenty-one actual
members of the sate central commit­
tee voted for McLean at the recent
"love" feast in Bismarck, and that the
eight or ten additional votes which
went to make up McLean's majority
were cast by proxies. There are 49
members on the state central com
mittee, and should it be ruled that
holders of proxies are not entitled
to a vote in the deliberations of that
body, McLean would fall short of a
majority.
Question of Precedent.
There seems to be no special pre
cedent or rule, or law, or judicial
procedure upon which a decision as
to the eligibility of McLean may be
based. State committees and nation­
al committers have quite commonly
named chairman who were not mem
—Afixs-^f-4**! electing bodies. The l&rr
provides that a chairman shall be
named, but defines no particular quali­
fications which would impose com­
mittee membership, it is claimed.
To File Briefs Next Week.
The court has the case under ad­
visement'pending the filing of briefs
and argurheints by the contending at­
torneys, or the attorneys for the con
tendon. It. Is expected that these
will be placed before the court by
the last of the week, and a decision
is not probable before tbe first of next
week.

West Point, 'New York, Sept. 30.—
The Army's eleven won the first con­
test of its Beason from Lebanon Val­

legians were stronger than had been
expected and displayed a wonderful
defense inside their own five yard
line.
Vidal, recently from the University
of South Dakota, played well. He
booted a field goal near the end of
the second quarter, which gave the
soldiers their only score.
GIANT'S WINNING
STREAK IS BROKEN
New York, Sept. 30.—After Rube
Benton had shut out Boston in the
first game of a double header, 4 to 0,
for New York's 26th straight victory,
the great winning streak of the home
team was broken in the second game,
which Boston won 8 *o 3. Though
the locals broke the old Major record
of 20 straight early in the week, they
just missed tieing the world's record
for established leagues, made by the
Corsicana, Texas League team in 1903,
when it won 27 straight games.

Business Abroad
Buffalo, N. Y., Sept. 30.—Charles B.
Hughes, in speeches at Jamestown
late today and here tonight, assailed
the administration for its attitude to­
ward American business development
abroad. He assailed the government
for failure to obtain government sup­
port of their plans to participate in
the proposed six-power loan to China,
and the administration's Mexican pol­
icy in support of his attack.
"It is said by the administration
that they desire to open the door for
American enterprise," Mr. Hughes
said. "What is the inducement for
our merchants and business men to
go to foreign countries and engage
in American enterprises if they and
their investments are treated as our
citizens and their property were per­
mitted to be treated in Mexico?"

Mr. Frazier feels confident that
North Dakota will cast a splendid

The sentiment seems overwhelming­
ly for the Republican candidate, al­
though he finds that the farmers are
still very busy with their fall work
and are not getting excited over mat­

London, Sept. 30.—Troops of the
Central Powers, under the command
of General von Falkenhayn, former
chief of the German general staff,
have gained a decisive victory over
the Roumanian invaders of central
Transylvania. The Roumanians were
crushed between two forces, in a bat­
tle which raged for three days. Af­
ter suffering horfj^losses, the invad­
ers are reported fleefog in disorder
into the mountains.
Make Strategic Move.
The defeat of the Roumanians was
brought about by a strategic move,
virtually impossible, on the western
battle front.
General von Falkenhayn divided his
force of Germans and Austrian-Hun*
garians. While one body engaged the
I Roumanians at Hermanstadt, the oth*
ers encircled the Roumanians and
seized Rothenburg pass in the moon*
tains, 1 miles southeast of Herman*
I stadt, and one of the first points gals*
ed by the Roumanians in their ad*
vance.
Wedge In Roumanians.
Both forces then pressed in upon

In eastern Transylvania the Rouma
nians also suffered a repulse. Their.

varhily was checked, and a German
atack in the same region resulted la
the capture of 600 prisoners.
On the Somme Front.
Fighting continues on the Somm#
front, but with little change in tbe
positions of the combatants. The Ger­
mans coninue their counter attacks
around Thiepval. Further south, the
French have made an advance north
of Rancourt, driving their wedge in
1 the German lines there. Berlin re*
ports the repulse ot British attac)n
on this front.
British Losses Have Been Heavy.
During September, the British in
the advance in the Somme front, lost
almost 120,000 officers and men. This
is at the rate of 3800 per day, but
falls below the daily human cost for
August. Since the offensive begaiu
figures published in London show that
the British have lost approximately
300,000 men in their efforts to break
the German defenses.
No important changes in Mfecedo*
nia, in Dobrujda, on the Austro-Ital*
ian front, or on the eastern front
are announced.
Fighting confines at various points
on all these fronts, except in Dobrud
ja, where Field Marshal von iMacken*

apparently are awaiting«developmenta
in other quarters.
