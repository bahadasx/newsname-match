Paris, Ark., Sept. 0. A. F. llruce
has been arrested as the result of a
jcorouers' verdict at Kalamazoo that
ho might have been connected with
! the death of David Cclburn, an aged
'farmer, found dead In his field yester

head indicated that acid had been
forcibly poured down his throat. Bruce

BURIAL OF NAVAL OFFICER.
Tho statement was made yester
day that news or the Fox develop
ment had reached John Klngllng and
that he would be here within the
next ten day. It Is very natural
that Mr. Klngllng will not like tr sen

Mncllng road built to Fox, this city
would rather nave a line built direct
from here. It will open up more
towns in

and will be a property of greater
taxable wealth.
While some of the best Informed
men of tno city believe that the
Santa Fe will build the road yet
there are others who do not believe
that John Ulngling and President
Ripley will stage a race to the new
oil field.
The probable result Is that neither
of them will build and that an Inter
urban will build out of this city to
the new Fox field.
Full Military Honors at Burial of Late
Rear Admiral Vreeland.
Washington, Sept. 30. Funeral ser
vices for the late Rear Admiral Chas.
E. Vreelund, United Slates navy, re
tired, were held today, with interment
at Arlington Cemetery with full mili
tary honors. The admiral died at
Atlantic City Wednesday.
According to reports from London, a
great political crisis has been slowly
developing in Germany. The pan Ger
mans, before the opening of the Reich
stag on Sept. 28, have been making
every effort, tho correspondent says,
to overthrow Chancellor von Iteth-mann-Hollweg.
The Rerllner Tage
blatt is quoted as saying:
"Tension in the atmosphere of Im
perial politics has reached such a
high point that a discharge must fol
low If the empire Is not to suffer last
ing damage."
Reuter's correspondent says articles
In tho Independent National Corres
pondent! show that the pan Germans
are lighting for a policy of ruthless
submarine war, the chief obstacle of
which is the Imperial chancellor.
A conference of the socialists of
the German empire has adopted by a
vote of 251 to 5 a resolution declaring
the country must be defended until
Its enemies aro prepared to conclude
a pence guaranteeing the political and
territorial integrity and the economic
development of Germany, according to
a telegram from Ilcrlin received at
Amsterdam and forwarded by the Rou
ter Telegraph company.

WEATHER FORECAST
New Orleans. La., Sept. 3n.
The weather forecast for
Oklahoma for Sunday Is fair
and warmer.
The hotel situation In this city will
be materially changed for tho better
when the New Whlttingtoti Hotel
opens which will be between October
15 and November 1. This modern hos
telry is being completed now and will
be ready for occupancy within an
other month.
A deal was finally close"! yesterday,
by which J. C. Moody, formerly of Ok
lahoma City will take charge of the
management of the hotel. Mr. Moody
Is a stockholder in the Ardmore Mcr-
Tho Ardmore Railway company
which owns the system of street
railways in Ardmore now have en
gineers at work making a survey and
computing the cost of construction
of tin electric line from here to the
new Fox oil district. One of the
routes will be surveyed by Springer
hut where tho other two routes will
he surveyed Is not known. One of
them will in alt probability he direct
to Fox with a branch at Keller cx
tending through the Santa Fe field
and on to Healdt'On while tho other
probably Is by the towns of Lone
Grove, Wilson, Wirt and to Fox with
a loop back by way of the asphalt
mines at Woodford and through the
Springer Valley. However these
statements are mere deductions.
I. M. Putnam who is general man-
j nger of the street railway stated yes
terday that his associates were all
out of the city and that he Is not
authorized to make any statements
for them. He did state, however,
that he had been Instructed to get up
the surveys mentioned and to have
rompiled by competent engineers a
statement of the cost of construction
of a line along the different routes.
Immediately upon receipt of these

COMES IRRESISTABLE AND
MAYOR WILL REBUILD FOR
TUNE AFTER OFFICE CAREER.
"You may state to the people of
Ardmore that I will at Tuesday
night's meeting of the Uoard of City
Commissioners tender my resigna
tion as mayor and will insist upon
Its acceptance," said Mayor L. V.
Mullen yesterday.
"I have sacrificed iw heavily al
ready In a business way and I do
not feel that I can In Justice to my
own Interests serve the people longer
at this time as their mayor."
Mr. Mullen was chosen as the
Peniocratic nominee for mayor al
most two years ago over some of the
city's most popular men and was
then elected without opposition to
the office of mayor. After serving
for a year and a half the call of the
oil and land business becomes Irres
istible and he will leave off the er
mine of office and enter activity into
the game of business again where he
formerly met with a measure of
success.

THE SITUATION OVER OPIN
ION IS ROAD WILL BE BUILT.
11. A. Simpson and I). C. Fitzgerald
have returned from a business trip to
Chicago. While they did not go there
on a proposition of building a new
railroad, hut .while they were there
they learned that the Fox field had
romi! in and they Immediately put the
proposition up to the Santa ?v, ask
ing them to build a line of rond from
Ardmore to Fox. They were assured
that the matter would receive the ear
nest consideration of the road and an
engineer w ill pmc here within a few
days. The company stated that If the
reports it had oil tho topography of
the country and of tho extent of the
oil area were confirmed by Its engi
neers, that the line nf road would be
built.
It Is firmly believed by some of the
lest business men In Ardmore that
the Santa Fe will build a line out of
this ctiy to the new oil area. They state
that the road will not In any way in
terfere w ith the Rlngllng road, that Its
paralleling of that line of road out
of here will not stand In the way of
the Santa Fe's building and they be
lieve that work will begun Immedi
ately. New locations nre being made
at Fox. 1Oiig wagon hauls will begin
this week and the oil men would ap
preciate a line of road. The people of
Ardmore ami those at Fox as well as
at nil intermediate points would ap
preciate the road. It will niean more
taxable wealth for the county. It will
mean some prosperous little towns' out
to the northwci-t. It will mean better
schools and better churches and more
profits to the Carter county furniers
out that way. It will lie nf vast benc-
fit to Ardmore. It will further cinch
