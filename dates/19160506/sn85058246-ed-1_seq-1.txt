The City Commission has aijvlscd
Mr. E. T. Lewis, chairman of tho
Clvlo Improvement committee or the
club that It will remove refuse etc.
for people unable to do provided
such refuse is placed at the curb
line. It Is taken for granted that
this very liberal offer will not bo
abused and ouly thoe physically or
financially unablo to remove their
rubbish, will take advantago of It.
The spirit of clean up and paint
up was much manifested on many
blocks and there was considerable
work done. Still thero 'arc a num
ber of vacant lots which need at
tention and old fences repaired or
removed. The nearby property own
ers and tho captains of the blocks
should report such places to the Clv
lo Improvement commttteo nnd an
effort will bo made to get the own
ers to clean them.
The committee desires to call at
tention to the necessity of killing
tho dandelion before It goes to seed.
This plant Is obnoxious nnd Is a
detriment to. the appearance ot
lawns.
Today will by no means end the
activity of the commttteo as there
aro many matters being planned that
If carried Into effect will Improve
tho appearance and conditions ot tho
city very materially. Next year tho
paint up and clean up campaign will
bo worked out much more thorough
