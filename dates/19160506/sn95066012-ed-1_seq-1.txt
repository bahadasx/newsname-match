CRITICISES AMERICAN PARTIALITY
Says This Country Should Treat Both
Belligerents Alike But Fails to
Do So.
WlsfctagKiTv May ;6. There will be
no .diplomatic break between the Unit-

would 1)0 formarjynade ly President I
WrrsOh' after he has read fne offlcfal
text of the not o1 from Berlin which
reached the "state department last
night- by cable from Berlin.
The German note, according to the
press versions received yesterday,
says that new orders have already
been given to the German naval lorces
requiring them to observe the rules of I
international law in their warfare on
commerce, but it is expected that the
United States will bring about the
abandonment by Great Britain of ille
gal practices on the seas. If this Is
not done, the German government
would then be facing a new situation,
"in which it must reserve to itself
complete liberty of action."
It was stated authoritatively after
the cabinet meeting yesterday that if
the official text bore out the unofficial
version transmitted In yesterday's
Berlin news dispatches, Germany's as
surances undoubtedly would be ac
cepted and before taking another step.
the' United States would await the ful
filment of her latest promises.
In such case, the United States
might not reply to the note and would
await evidence of the actual abandon
ment of Germany's present practices
of submarine warfare which is de
clared. President Wilson Is described
by those close about bfni as being in
a position where he cannot question
the good faith of ..Germany's assur
ances, which must stand or fall by the

future conduct of her submarine com
manders. .
The German embassy view is that
the note gives all President Wilson
asked for; that it signalizes a return
to "cruiser warfare" the use of sub
marines as regular naval cruisers in
tercepting commerce with visit and
search and that inasmuch as It makes
no mention of the armed ship ques
tion, that perplexing feature of the
controversy is not involved.
Congress took the note quietly and
the general sentiment seemed to be In
favor of leaving the situation in the
hands of the president. On the sur
face there was no sign of activity in
the group which has been working to
prevent the president from pressing
the situation to the point of a diplo
matic rupture.
Cabinet members went over the un
official text carefully with the presi
dent and while they uniformly refused
to discuss It they reflected the view
that a break had been averted; that
Germany's new assurances would be
accorded the reference to the action
Germany expects jthe United States to
take against Great Britain's restraints
on neutral trade. J
H
fect it yields to the U. S. demands and
announces orders to submarine com
manders complying with these de
mands, but reserves the right to
change this policy if the United States
continues to unduly favor Great Brit
ain in dealing with the regulation of
ocean commerce.. In this connection
the note says; ;
"As the German Government repeat
edly declared, it cannot dispense with
the use of the submarine -weapon in
the conduct of warfare against enemy
trade. The German Government, how
ever, has now decided to make a fur
ther concession, adapting methods of
submarine war to the Interests of neu
trals. In reaching Us decision the
German Government Is actuated by con
Bideratlons which are above the level
of the disputed question.'
"The German Government attaches
no less Importance to the Bacred prin
ciples of humanity than the Govern
ment of the United States. It again
fully takes into account that both
Governments for many years co-operated
in developing international law In
conformity with these principles, the
ultimate object of which has always
been to confine warfare on sea and
land to armed forces of belligerents
and safeguard as far as possible non-
combatants against the horrors of war.
"But-although these considerations
are of great weigfit, they alone would
not under present circumstances have
determined the attitude of the German
Government. For in answer to the ap
peal by the Government of the United
States on behalf of the sacred priu
clples of humanity and international
law. the German Government must re
peat once more, with all emphasis
that it was not the German, but the
British Government which ignored all
accepted rules of ' international law
and extended this terrible war to the
lives and property of noncoinbatants
having no regard whatever for the in
terests and rights of neutrals and non
combatants that through this method
of warfare have been severely injured.
'In self-defense against the illegal
conduct of British warfare, while fight
ing a bitter struggle for national exis
tence, Germany had to resort to the
hard but effective weapon of sub
marine warfare."

WORKERS FORCED TO WALK
Trouble Brewing for Some Time Came
to a Crisis This Morning
Cars Stopped.
Albany, May 6. Motormen and con
ductors on the Schenectady Railway
company this morning at 2 o'clock de
cided not to take out the cars on the
day routes starting between 4 and 5
o'clock. Twenty-five thousand work
ers, therefore, will have to walk.
The Fonda, Johnstown and Glovers
ille railroad is not affected.
Schenectady Railway employes met
at 1 o'clock this morning to accept one
of two arbitration propositions or to
set a time for a strike which would tie
up all of the lines of the Schenectady
Railway company. The trolleymen de
manded a flat increase of five cents
an hour to take effect Immediately
and have refused the company's offer
of two cents an hour Increase to be in
effect for the next two years and an
additional one cent increase for the
third year.
Trolley car operators say every line
in the city would be tied up as well
as the Interurban lines running to Al
bany, Troy and Saratoga Springs, it
is also intimated that the employes of
the Fonda, Johnstown and Gloversville
railroad company, which operates in
terurban cars between Schenectady
and Gloversville, would not be permit
ted to operate on tracks of the Sche
nectady company. The interurban
cars would be halted at the Boston
and Maine railway bridge, about one
mile west of the Scotia bridge. A trol
ley strike at this time, it is believed,
would greatly Impair the output of
the two big Schenectady plants, which
are rushed with orders.
BLOCKADED BY A BEAR
Joe Ayres and Dick Rawson Kept Out
Late
J. M. Ayres, the local health officer,
and Richard F. Rawson, assistant
treasurer of the Bennington county
savings bank, left here Thursday even-
ng with the intention of passing the
nisht at Camp Killdeer in the Dun
ville notch. They didn't do it. When
about a hundred rods from tho main
highway they encountered a she bear
in the road and as Mamma Bruin was
not in a peaceful mood the two hikers
returned to- the farm house of Elzear
Pellerin where they remained until
morning.
It was about 10:30 o'clock at night
when the two men reached tho junc
tion of the Woodford and Dunvllle
roads. They hud hardly made the turn
into the notch when they heard the
crying of two animals which they later
learned were two young cubs. The
disturbance apparently came from a
point near the bank of the stream and
Mr. Ayres picked up several small
stones from the road. .One of the
stones he threw in thte direction of tht
itorse.fle didn't throw the other peb
ble for , at that instant a -bear, whict
Mr. A'res says looked. about as larpt
as a hippoKtan)usp crawled under,, a
fenco and walked into, the middle of
the road. .Tho health officer threw thp
the second stone at the I bear "Which
shook Its head and mhflen remarks
which tho two men were unable to un
derstand but wfiich they realized were
not at all friendly.
The men were provided with elec
tric flashlights' with which they were
able to plainly locate the bear agaiust
the surrounding gloom but they had no
weapons other than fishing rods and
soon came to the conclusion that the
bear had the right of way.
Returning to the Pellerin fnrm house
they routed out the farmer. The far
mer loaded his gun with a BB shell,
Mrs. Pellerin and Mr. RawBon secured
two pitchforks from the barn and the
quartette started out to remove tho in
struction from the highway. The old
bear was no longer In sight but tho
cubs were still crying in the brush
along the bank of the brook. Realiz
ing that the old boar was undoubted
ly not far from the little animals and
not relishing the possibility of a per
Bonal introduction at such a late hour
it was considered cood judgment to
return to the farm house for the re
mainder of the night.
.With the first glimmer of daylight
the health officer and tho assistant
treasurer again took tho road. They
found where the cubs had scratched
a large quantity of bark from a small
spruce tree near tho bank of the brook
At the foot of the tree the sod was
ripped from the ground for a numbe
of yards. Tho two men viewed tho
wreckage of grass roots and congratu
lated themselves that Mamma Rear
hnd vented her displeasure on the turf
Instead of using their anatomies for
that purpose.
