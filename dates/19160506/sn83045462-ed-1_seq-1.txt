to Columbus, X. M.. May 6.
?A full' squadron of 230 men of
the nth Cavalry surprised and
routed a much larger force of
Villa bandits at Ojo-Azules. seventeen
miles south of Cusihuirachic,
early yesterday. Fortytwo
Mexicans were killed and a
number wounded. There were no
American casualties.
The American command, under
.Maj. Kobert L. Howze. had been j
pursuing the bandits under Gens. j
Cruz Dominguez and Julio Acos- j
ta for several days when they en- j
countered them encamped in the j
huddled adobe huts of OjoAzules.
Bandits Taken by Surprise.
The Mexicans were completely surprised
and sprang from their pallets
half clothed. After firing a few wild
shats/ they began a flight, each man
shifting for his own safety. Some of
them were able to seise their horse*,
already jaded from a hard day's -ride
previously, but others made their way
into the hills afoot.
Maj. Howse reported he was still pursuing
the scattered remnant of the
band, which is the largest remaining
under the Villa standard. This decisive
victory gave much satisfaction to military
men here. It is believed the band
is the same as that defeated at Temoehic,
April 22, by Col. George A. Dodd's
command.

official report of the defeat of

Maj. Howze described the action as a j j
cavalry charge with pistols, the first
to occur since operations were begun.
The Americans had ridden thirty miles
before meeting the bandits.
The pursuit of the scattered Mexicans
was continued for two hours.
Gen. Pershing reported that six Carta
nza prisoners the bandits had been
holding for execution were released.
'Brilliant,'' Pershing Reports.
Jen Pershing pronounced the feat a
brilliant piece of work In his report to
the War Department today. The text j
of Gen. Pershing's report was as fol- :

A band of 140 Villistas that attacked 1
Carfanza garrison yesterday at Ojoazules
remained there In camp last night,

Forty-two killed actually counted j

be many.
"Several prisoners, also seventy-five
ponies and mules. Our cavalry rode I
them down and killed many, using
pistols. Fight lasted two hours, men j
being pursued as individuals into dif- I
flcult mountains. Five Carranzistas i
condemned to be shot were taken and !
released We have no casualties.
Howze left here 8:30 last night,
marched thlrtj'-six miles and reached
Ojoazules at daylight. Consider this a
brilliant piece of work. Other cavalry
detachments of this command are now
operating in the several districts."
Scott and Funston Hopeful
a Protocol Will Be Signed

and Kunaton plan today to hold another j
onfercnce with Gen. Alvaro Ohregon
n the expectation that before it ends
the suggestions of the United States
government for co-operative dispersal
of the Villa bands in Mexico will take
the form of a duly signed protocol, i
Prior tc the meeting, however, came
reports from ^uarez that were not quite
wo optimistic. It was reported that the
negotiations might extend into still an
other session of the conferees, because :
.Jen. Ca'rYanza had expiessed a wish for
further discussion of the subject of
withdrawal.
While the American conferees will
listen attentively to any suggestion
submitted h\ Gen. Obregon. there is no
chance, that any change in the attitude
?f the I'nited States will rake place,
it was said l?*re, except on minor details.
The fact that Gen. t'arranza did not
immediately indorse the tentative
agreement entered into by Gen. Obregon.
who was said to have come to the
border with plenary powers, has been
seized on as significant by "interventionists'
here, who have been predicting
a break between the first chief and
his minister of war.
They declare that the present situation
is but a forerunner of a wider
split to come between the two men.

Maj. John McBride fought throughout
the Boer war with the Irish brigade

McBride delivered a series of lectures

On their return to Paris Mrs. McBride
sued for divorce and was granted a

his interest in Irish political affairs and
was always identified with the extreme

UNCLE JOE CAM
HOiTO HOUSE
Colleagues Give Party in
Chamber in Celebration of
His 80th Birthday.
OPPONENT IN OLD RULES
BATTLE OCCUPIES CHAIR
Speaker Clark Pays Him High
Tribute and Predecessor Reminisces
in Address of Appreciation.
Uncle Joe Cannon, eighty years old tomorrow,
ayd for nearly fifty of those
years a big element in the nation's history,
was given a birthday party in the
House of Representatives today. It was
a cheering, hand-clapping, laughing, boyish
party, and for the first time in the history
of the Congress of the United States
the House set aside an hour of its working
time to honor a living member.
Today's birthday party goes down into
fame as a part of the records of the first
session of the Sixty-fourth Congress. The
words will be recorded in the archives of
the nation?but it is only in the memories
and hearts of those who witnessed
the unusual outpouring of words of kindness
and congratulation for a dear friend
that the true touch of this morning s hour
can be recorded.
Former Antagonist Presides.
The passing of time that heals all
wounds, real, fancied and political,
brought to the speakers chair to preside
over the party today one of the
original insurgents against that famous
series of legislative procedures known to
the country as the Cannon rules. Henry
All?n f'nnn?r rtf W i ucnn ?i n nno n f thp
deans of the national Congress, and a
tower of strength in the old rules flght
against Cannon when Speaker, acted
as Speaker during the major part of
the birthday proceedings today. His
presence in the chair was the signal
for a tumult of cheering.
There were many members present
who remembered the bitter struggles
of that other day, when the republican
side of the House rocked and swayed
in the struggle of the progressives
against the standpatters. Representative
Cooper's presence in'jthe chair
meant that the fight had passed over
and was gone, and that at any rate it
was a fight of measures?not men.
Uncle Joe and Mr. Cooper are friends.
Speaker Pays Him Tribute.
It was a characteristic speech that
Speaker Clark made today. He termed
Mr. Cannon one of th? "topnotcher class
of- mental pugilists." He also wrote
into the record for posterity the statement
that once, during debate, with his
own eyes, he saw Mr. Cannon perform
the unusual feat of describing a complete
circle on one heel.
"Mr. Speaker Cannon owes it to himself
and to his countrymen to write a
book of reminiscences," Speaker Clark
said, "Job's vengeful declaration, 'Oh,
that* mine adversary had written a
book" to the contrary notwithstanding.
Evidently the Man of Uz did not have
in his mind's eye Theodore Roosevelt
and Woodrow Wilson when he gave
voice to that far-resounding and malicious
desire."
Still carrying himself as straight as
an Indian and as ruddy-cheeked as a
schoolgirl, Mr. Cannon marched down
the center aisle of the House arid delivered
an address of appreciation filled
with reminiscences of other days.
Cites Non-Partisanship.
It brought, back the shadows of
Mlainp Ran/tall n Rut to- v
Hoar, "Sunset" Cox, "Pig Iron" Kelly
and a score of other former cotemporaries
of Mr. Cannon to the halls where
once they served. Mr. Cannon was
quick to observe the non-partisan
character of the occasion, and his opening;
words were in appreciation of it:
"This is a sample of the partisanship
of the House." he said. "I can
sa> with the psalmist, 'The lines have
fallen unto me in pleasant places.' and
as 1 look into the faces of friends on
both sides of the House | am more inclined
to accept the plain evidence of
fact than the popular and picturesque
fiction which divides this body into
partisan groups on all questions, shuts
out personal relations and the co-operation
of representatives regardless j
of party, to work out in legislation the '
greatest good to the greatest number.
Recalls Changes in Policies.
"I have seen some changes in partisan
policies. When I came here believing
in nationalism. I was impressed with
th<* states rights doctrines of some of
the men on that side, and I remember
a speech by Randolph Tucker of Virginia
in opposition to Randall's bill to
loan $1,500,000 to the Philadelphia centennial
exposition. Mr. Tucker warned
the House against stretching the welfare
ciause of the Constitution. He
said it would be an advertisement inviting
any clever man who had an idea
about spending government money for
the general welfare to come to Congress.
and it would not be long before
we were crowded off our stools by the
lobbyists who wanted to get their
hands into the Treasury. Mr. Tucker,
then turning to Randall, shouted a final
warning that should that appropriation
be made, Chicago and even Vorktown
would some day come for aid to an exposition
Well, they both came, and
many others, and Mr. Tucker's son was
president of the Jamestown exposition.
That Is only an example of some of the
changes that have come about the use
of government money to promote the
general welfare. We've had quite a
spell of It in the consideration of the
agricultural, appropriation .ull."
I He continued
i "So I have found the partisanship of
mis nouse mrougnoui mese rorty
years sometimes warm and vigorous,
but largely mixed with patriotism and
much common sense; no barriers in the
center aisle to prevent men from
crossing that partisan line, and no
prohibition against meeting in lobby
or the cloakroom and talking it over
in private. It has been to ine a
pleasant and. 1 hope, a profitable experience.
Gave Politics No Thought.
"If 1 sometimes see the faces and !
hear the voices of others not now here
.to answer to the roll call I may not
be charged with dreaming, for among
these 3,000 men with whom I have
been associated in legislative efforts
and over partisan contests there were
hosts of personal friends of whom I
never thought as republicans or democrats
except as we discussed different
policies. These men had their hour on
I this stage, did their work in their time,
las you are doing It now, following the
line of precedent; here amending

AVENUE PROPERTY
PURCHASE BEATEN
l/Vorks Amendment to Good
Roads Bill Defeated in Senate
on Viva Voce Vote.
AUTHOR MAKES STRONG
PLEA FOR ITS ADOPTION
Dffers Another Amendment Providing
$600,000 for Purchase of
Snow Court Slum District.
A strong plea for the adoption of bl?
imendment to the good roads bill, pro
v ininK mr me purcnane 01 1110 piuperty
along both sides of Pennsylvania
ivenue between the Capitol and the
Treasury, was made in the Senate toiay
by Senator Works of California.
The amendment was defeated on a
viva voce vote.
Senator Gallinger of New Hampshire
tnd Senator Sutherland of Utah both
joined with Senator Works in expressng
approval of the plan to purchase
this land for the government, both to
make Pennsylvania avenue a splendid
thoroughfare and also to obtain sites
Tor new government buildings much
needed by various departments and
bureaus of the government.
Would Provide $100,000,000.
Senator Works' amendment proposed
$100,000,000 as the limit of cost for the
purchase of this property. Senator Gallinger
suggested that this was far too
much, that during the service of the late
Senator Heybum of Idaho, who fathered
measure to purchase the property on
the south side of the avenue, an estimate
had been submitted to the Senate that it
would cost $18,383,000 to purchase the
(Jivpcny VII l HC BUUUI nine, ciuu nmv
later the District Commissioners had estimated
that the property not now owned
bv the government could be bought for
about $13,000,000.
Both Senator Gallinger and Senator
Sutherland suggested that Senator
Works modify his amendment so that
it provide for the purchase of the
property on the south side of Pennsylvania
avenue, but on the north side
only from 1st street to 6th street. They
pointed out that many valuable and
costly buildings had been erected on
the north side of the avenue from 6th
street to the Treasury, and that it
would cost a great deal of money to
purchase them. Senator Works said
he would be content so to modify his
amendment.
Senator Bankhedd, in charge of the
?ood roads bill; Senator Vardaman of
Mississippi, Senator Shaffroth of Colo-ado
and others opposed the adoption
yf the amendment, which, they said,
lad nothing to do with the good roids
bill properly, and who contended that
the government ought to go ahead
vith its buildings on property already
)wned by it. instead of purchasing
nore land at this time.
Defends "Joke" Amendment.
Senator Works declared Senator
Bankhead had characterized the amendnent
as a "practical joke."
"It may b? a joke to present to the
Senate a plain, practical business
proposition without the hope of getting
i vote by it." Mr. Works said. "It may
ye a joke to endeavor to' rehabilitate
he great national thoroughfare in the
lation's capital and. at the same time
present a plan that would prove an
iconomy in the construction of federal
puildings. >
"It may be a joke to make the city of J
Washington clean, decent and respectable, j
>ut it may not be a practical joke to
jxtract from the Treasury under false
pretenses $75,000,000 to be distributed to |
dates which have no more right to the j

Cites Annual Rental Bill.
"What buildings have been eonstruct:d
for the government have not been
instructed on Pennsylvania avenue, as
hey should haVe been, in my mind, but
tave been scattered over the city. Intead
of the government owning all its
>uildings, it is paying about $700,000 a
^ear for rent and nearly each year
idds to the buildings and additions.
"Leaving out sentimental questions
nd viewing it from a business point of i
dew. it would be an economy to con- 1
truct our own buildings. These build- (
ngs which are being rented are inadeluate,
expensive and do not meet fur- 1
her needs.'* i
Senator Works said it had been sug- .
ested to him that the Senate was not
n appropriate place to advocate legis- j
ition for Pennsylvania avenue under .
he post-roads bill.
"Pennsylvania avenue falls under the J
pecltications of the post-roads bill,"
aid Mr. Works, "except that it is not :
ural. but if you go to look at it thor- J
ughly, it comes very near being a rural
oad. I
"The Senate is just as appropriate a |
lace to legislate for Pennsylvania
venue as to legislate for a road in

Would Eliminate Slum District.

to the good roads bill providing ?
500.000 for the purchase of Snow court. 5

Senator Works pictured the slums t

and urging Congress to take v

"Yet J see with regret that very few

Senator Dane of Oregon suggested b

GERMANY ON TRIAL.
ISOFFICIALVIEW
Official Text of Note Does Not
Change Attitude Against
Immediate Break.
MAY MAKE SHORT REPLY
ACCEPTING NEW PLEDGE
Berlin Would Be Told Future Relations
Depended on Submarine
Commanders.
Th? offlcinl text of frerm?TiT'? not*,
fully decoded and laid before President
Wilson today, shows no material
differences from the unofficial text published
yesterday In news dispatches.
This strengthens the probability that
a diplomatic break has been averted,
at least for the present.
Overnight study of the note by cabinet
members and officials did not
change their view that probably thera
would be no break in diplomaic relations
unless there were further attacks
in violation of international law.
May Make Brief Reply.
There Is a possibility that the United
States may make a brief reply notifying
the Berlin government that as long
as the new orders to submarine commaqders
are fully observed diplomatic
relations will not be discontinued on
that score.
Secretary Lansing already has studied
the note once and was going over it
very carefully again today. There were
indications that further consideration
by the cabinet would not be necessary.
Count von BernstorfT, the German ambassador.
returned to the embassy today
from New York. He said he had
no communication from his government
and had no reason to visit the
State Department in connection with
the note unless he were invited or instructed
by his government to do so.
The embassy view that the note was
all the United States asked remained
unchanged.
Cabinet Members Quit City.
Several members of the cabinet have
left Washington and are not expected
back before Monday. Secretary Lansing:
has gone to Annapolis for the week
end. Secretary Baker is in Cleveland
and Postmaster General Burleson is en
a short fishing trip.
President Wilson is described by those
close about him as being- in a position
where he cannot question the good
faith of Germany's assurances, which
must stand or fall by the future conduct
of her submarine commanders.
Administration officials stated that
Germany doubtless would be given a
chance to demonstrate her assurances
that submarine commanders will not
sink merchant vessels without warning.
View of German Embassy.
The German embassy view is that the
note gives all President Wilson asked
for: that it signalizes a return to
"cruiser warfare"?the use of submarines
as regular naval cruisers intercepting
commerce with visit and search
?and that inasmuch as it makes no
mention of the armed ship question
that perplexing feature of the con
troversy is not involved.
Much interest was apparent today
among officials on editorial opinions of
the German note. Many of these suggested
the reply should be considered
satisfactory pending the result of
Germany's promise "to do its utmost
to confine operations of the war fo:
the rest of its duration to the fighting
forces of the belligerents."' others
suggested that a diplomatic break
would be advisable. They pointed particularly
to the apparent tendency of
Germany to qualify the submarine assurances
by conditions concerning the
conduct of British naval warfare.
Interested in Peace Hint.
President Wilson read today with careful
attention the portion of the note
touching on peace. Some officials be
lieved unusual significance should be attached
to that part of the note because
it was taken to indicate officially that recent
speeches of Chancellor von Bethmann-Hollweg
before the relchstag were
intended 'as notices to the world that Germany
was ready for peace on certain
terms.
The note says "the German government.
conscious of Germany's strength,
twice wthin the last few months announced
before the world Its readiness
to make peace on a. basis safeguarding
Germany's vital interests, thus indicating
It is not Germany's fault if peace
is still withheld from the nations of
Europe.'*
While it was indicated today that
President Wilson would make no
further peace moves until the allied
jrovernments have signified their wtllngness
to receive suggestions on the
rnbject some officials thought today
;he German note might possibly draw
orth something from the allies. i
