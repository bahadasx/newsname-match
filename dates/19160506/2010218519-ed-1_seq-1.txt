IF military training
could bo introduced
jj& into our public schools
for boys when they
reach twelve years o
i age, short exercises
I daily, and then a more
thorough training be
made a feature of the
high schools and uni-
versities with encamp
ments each autumn, it
would be the best se-
curity for the mainte
nance of order and the
cordial good will of the
people toward each oth
er that could be de
vised. Had this been inaug

; years ago, we should
have had no civil war.
The bane of most peo

what they can do, and
after a while become

1 selves. In addition
they become clannish
f and unconsciously of-
fensive in some of their
i f ways.

QitAGGED, ill-fed, barefoot boy once peddJed woodenwares over the sheaths of Scotland, sup
porting a blind father and a family of seven. At night this child often slept curled up by
the roadway or in barns or fence corners. In the day he ate sparingly that he might carry
food to his home. Such was the child that inscrutable destiny had decreed should, in his
alotted days, pass through many hardships, coming at last to be a great empire builder.
David Eccles (deceased) was born May 12, 1849, in Paisley, Wrenfrewshire, Scotland. Ho was
the son of William and Sarah (Hutchinson) Eccles. At fourteen years ho had had but six months of
book learning. Afterwards he attended for a few months the pioneer schools of Utah, but it was not
until he was about twenty-six years of age that ho began to master for himself the rudiments of educa
tion. But this he did in so thorough a manner especially in tho study of mathematics that afterwards
he was a marvel in the business and financial world.
Tho story of tho life of this industrial and financial giant, who lived honored and respected and
died possessing one of the largest fortunes of the west, is one of great self-denial and iron will in tho
attainment of a single purpose. His father was a hard working wood turner until blindness stayed
his labors. Practically from the ago of seven the support of tho family devolved upon this child. In
18G3 ho was fourteen years old, his father and mother with eir seven small children emigrated to
America. The little band proceeded immediately west and closed the plains with a company under

With military train- H

annual autumnal ma- H
neuvers in different 'H
states, having the t H
young men of different j H
states meet and mingle H
under the same flag; fll
before very long these ttifl
encampments would bo 'H
looked forward to as jH
the feature of the year H
and a good fellowship H
would result up on ,H
which the safety of the H
state would rest with jH
absolute security. And lH
the very best that is in H
the young men would jH
be brought out; the H
best in their bodies, jH
the best in their souls, M
the best in their hearts, l
and an insult to native
land would come to all H
of them alike as a H
blow in the face. ,H
By this means the 'H
very best possible se- jH

there would come this '
consciousness to all the '
