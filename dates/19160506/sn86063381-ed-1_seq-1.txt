THE
VOLUME XIV, NO. 112.
Many land buyers arrived in Be
midji today to attend the tax judg
ment sale which will be held at the
court house Monday The sale will
begin at ten o'clock in the morning
and George, county auditor, will
be in charge It is expected that the
sale will last for several days as was
the case last year
Under Volstead Act.
The sale will be held under the
Volstead act. The act provides that
lands in the drainage district which
have been unentered or unpatented,
may be sold at $1 25 per acre, plus
the usual filing fees, to pay for the
ditching charges The land is usual
ly sold in 40-acre tracts and the sale
is restricted to 160-acre allotments
Bidding Keen.
As several parties are known to be
after the same tracts of land it is
believed that the bidding will be
keen All funds received in excess
of the assessment are at present turn
ed over to the government County
Auditor George recently went to
Washington to secure an amendment
to the Volstead act so that all funds
in excess should be turned over to
the county for the maintenance of
ditches.
Lands Assessed.
In 1908, the government possessed
millions of acres of swamp lands in
Northern Minnesota which were prac
tically worthless In that yoar con
gress enacted the law providing that
these lands should become subject to
the laws of the state relating to the
drainage of the lands for agricultural
purposes and that the cost of such
drainage should be assessed to the
lands benefited, and the collection of
such benefits should be made in the
same as was the collection of other
taxes, but no obligating the govern
ment in any way.
The following information is given
as to the conducting of the sale:
After a ditch has been established
by the court, the contract for con
struction is let, and a lien is filed
against all the lands benefited by
the ditch, whether owned privately
or by the government
Lien Twenty Years.
This lien extends for twenty years,
the principle payable in fifteen an
nual installments after the first five
years, the interest payable on all un
paid balance every year.
If the first year's interest is not
paid, it becomes delinquent with
other taxes of that year, and is ad
vertised with other taxes, and sold
at the annual tax sale.
Under the terms of the "Volstead
Act" of May 20, 1908, purchasers
at this tax sale, may bid on these
government lands, and are entitled
to file on the unentered lands for
homesteads, provided they possess
the required homestead qualifications
and pay to the government the mini
mum price of $1 25 per acre, and the
government fees, on presentation of
the tax certificate at the land office
Money to Government.
The act also provided that any ex
cess of money received by the county
auditor over and above the total
drainage assessment shall be paid to
the government as a bonus for the
land, before a patent shall be issued.
In accordance with this provision,
bids for any amount will be consider
ed by the auditor in making the sale.
This amount up to the amount of
the total drainage assessment will
be credited to the ditch lien on the
land, and a satisfaction filed with
the register of deeds to that effect.
Bonus is Paid.
For an example, the SW of the
NE of Section 23, Town 153, Range
30 may be placed on the delinquent
tax list for $4.98, being the amount
of delinquent interest for 1912
against that tract, account of ditch
No 10 lien.
The total assessment against this
forty may be $116.80 from benefits
derived from that ditch, which with
the interest for 1914, being to June
1, 1915, and which may be said to
amount to $7.01, would make a total
of $123 81.
Now if several parties interested
in this particular tract should bid
it up to $4 00 an acre over and above
the delinquent tax, the lien would
be satisfied entirely, and the balance,
$36.19, would be paid to the govern
ment as a bonus.
Should the bids only reach $2.00
an acre on this tract, the lien would
HlUlf nun niiurnn be satisfied to tl"-ixtent $80.00,

country, abandoned after
lumbermen had "cut over"
38,000 acres in this vicinity,
became waste, held by the
county at 50 cents an acre,

came the land rush, in which
Bohemian interests gained
the majority of the land.

CHARTER COMMISSION
DISCUSSES PROPOSED
LIGHTINGAMENDMENT
Meeting is Held at Commercial Club
Rooms Action to Be Taken
at Once.
PRESIDENT AND SECRETARY
INSTRUCTED TO FRAME MEASURE
City Council at a Special Meeting
Monday Night Will Discuss
Project.
At a meeting of the Bemidji char
ter commission last evening at the
Commercial club rooms, A. P. White
and Fred W. Rhoda, president and
secretary of the commission, respec
tively, were appointed to frame an
amendment to the present charter to
provide for the installation of a
"white way." Meet With Attorney.
Mr. White and Mr. Rhoda met with
an attorney today and it is expected
that the proposed amendment will be
in shape to present to the charter
commission Monday afternoon and to
the city council Monday evening. The
city council will meet in special ses
sion Monday evening to consider the
Nymore-Lake Shore highway project.
To Vote in June.
Efforts will be made, if the amend
ment is satisfactory to the cojnmis
sion, to prepare the amendment for
the primary election which will be
held June 19, thus saving the ex
pense of calling a special election.
It was pointed out at the commis
sion meeting last evening that the
present charter practically omitted
providing for a "white way" or for
the lighting of the city. If a "white
way" were to be installed under the
present charter, the entire city would
be assessed for the installation ex
pense. This, it was pointed out,
would be an injustice to the outly
ing resident who would not directly
benefit by the "white way."
To Cost About $90.
The installation of a "white way"
cluster light would cost about $90.-
It is proposed to place four in a block
and to install, at present, about 13
blocks of the "white way." The pro
ject is to install a "white way" on
both Minnesota and Beltrami avenues peace pact today,
from the depots to the court housed, Reports are^current here that Villa
and cross streets to the lafce khote.
The plan of the members of- the
commissioners present at the meeting
last evening was to assess the instal
lation of a "white way" two-thirds
against the abutting proper owner
and one-third against the entire city.
By this plan the adjoining prop
erty owner would pay about seventy
per cent of the installation cost, two
thirds of the expense and his share
one-third of the expenses assessed
against the entire city.
The commission at the meeting left
the working out of how a "white
way" was to be installed to the presi
dent and secretary. It appeared to
be the sense of the meeting that the
installation of a system should be
granted on a petition of property
owners.

SPEEDILY END WAR
Colonel House May Revisit European
Capitols Irish Leader
Shot.
Washington, May 7.Germany's
note has averted a break with the
United States. President Wilson's
advisors today stated that the Ger
man-American submarine issue was
closed. The United States will not
answer the German reply, indicating
that the issue is closed.
Will Issue Statement.
President Wilson studied the offi
cial text very closely this morning.
It is believed here that Secretary
Lansing will issue a short statement
this afternoon,- calling public atten
tion to Germany's statement that only
warships will be torpedoed hereafter,
It is believed that the matter will

many will not open it by the resump

Prepare for Peace.
American circles are studying the
important peace features of the .Ger
man reply It is thought that Presi
dent Wilson now has a great-oppor
tunity to speedily end the war. Some
even suggested that the time is now
ripe for Colonel House to revisit the
European capitols.
Washington, May 6 The follow
ing editorial comment on the note is
culled from representative papers
throughout "the United States:
Averts Present Trouble.
Baltimore Sun: Knowing the dif
ficulties with which the German gov
ernment is contending, we can well
afford to overlook what in other cir
cumstances would be presumption and
impudence. The note leaves this
country in more or less suspense. But
it does apparently, avert immediate
trouble.
"Break Off Relations."
New York Tribune: Mr. Wilson
can do but one thing. He must
break off relations with the imperial
German government, without delay
and without hesitation. The recall
uf Gerard, and the dispatch of Bern
storff to his own country. These are
the things that we can no longer
postpone. They are the least that
can be done they may well be but
the beginning, but they must be done.
Chicago Herald: The German gov
ernment demands that we compel
Great Britain to raise her starvation
blockade, though incessantly and
vociferously denying that Germany is
or can be starved by it. It calls up
on us, in fact, to fight the British
navy if necessary, lest "women and
children be starved." Of course that
is precisely what Germany did at the
siege of Paris, but the women and
children were not Germans.
Delays Must Intervene.
San Francisco Chronicle: The vast
majority of the American people,
more desirous of preserving peace
than concerned with the technicali
ties of international law, will be
quietly pleased to* note that other
days and other messages must inter
vene before there can be any rupture
with any European belligerent.
Proposal "Unthinkable."
New York World: All that part
of the Germany reply which contem
plates an alliance between Germany
and the United States to break a
British blockade that Germany her
self cannot break, is impossible. It's
unthinkable. To grant it would put
a stain on the honor of the United
States that could never be erased.
What Germany has yielded, she must
yield in obedience to law, and for the
express benefits of barter.
