Officials of the Mexican embassy
took up these questions with the state
department today in an Informal and
entirely friendly manner. The cam?

forces in Southern Mexico makes it
necessary that full supplies be as?

Washington government was anxious
to do all in its power to aid in re?

State department officials are un?

"It Can not bo said too often that

me at Chicago unless they are pre?

for certain great and vital principles.
'^For that reason I most earnestly
hope that the delegates who go to
Chicago will nominate some man on
whom Republicans and Progressives

be heartily supported by all Inde?
pendent citizens and particularly by
I all independent Democrats who are
loyal to the nationalism of Andrew
Jackson and who are prepared to put
the vital honor and interest of this
nation above all mere partisan consid?
eration. I hope they will choose a
man upon whom all can unite and

Along with the increased acreage

approximates a decrease of 25 per

nitrates and the excessive prices
charged for available products.

extended ultimately to all the banks
in the United States. In a letter ta
member banks announcing that the
new plan would be effective June 16, .
and outlining its details, the board
says:
"It is the purpose of the federal re*
serve board to have the collection
system developed so as to embrace
the collection of checks on non

member banks."
Member banks are warned not to
impair their reserves by drawing
against items in process of collection
under! the new system, as such drafts
will be charged against reserves'. *
"Inasmuch as it is essential that
the law in respect to the mainte?
nance of required reserves he strictly
complied with," says the latter, ?ta*
board will fix a penalty to be Imposed
upon member banks for eacroacaisff
upon their reserves. Member banks
can at all times keep their reserves
intact by redlscounting with their

An accurate method of determining
the true status of the reserve hajd
by the federal banks for eash member
