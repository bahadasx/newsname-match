Scott expects to sign the El Paso

Carranzista war minister, today, es
tablishing between the two govern
ments the status of the American ex
pedition and providing for its future
course. Whatever obstacles pre
vented Obregon from signing yester
day, were believed to have been over
come and he was expected to meet
Scott in the last conference without
further hesitation. Obregon declared
his messages from General Carranza
were garbled and that this prevented
him from sealing the agreement as
scheduled. Officials here frankly dis
believed this excuse, asserting Car
ranza probably hoped the German re
ply to the submarine demands would
affect the Mexican situation.
As arrangements went forward for
the Anal meeting of the war confer
ence. confidential accounts revealed
an amazing phase of the preliminary
negotiations when Scott met Obregon
in Juarez. Scott sent O. P. Brown,
war department agent, to Juarez to
"throw the fear of God into their
hearts" just before the first confer
ence started. Brown, unable to find
Obregon, conferred Instead with Gen
eral Gavlra, commandant at Juarez
and Copsul Garcia of EH Paso, giving
the-m Scott's message to Obregon.
The communication was a warning
that the United States would no
longer tolerate anarchy in Mexico
and that If the Mexicans continued
their attitude of assert!veness and
defiance, the years 1916 and 1!17
would be blacker marks In Mexican
history than 1846 and 1847.
Despite this. Obregon made sweep
in demands in the first conference, it
was learned today and issued a vir

today. The fear was that Carranza
might at least deny ratification of

American expedition.
The hope was that the reported
definite location of Villa might mean
early success for American arms.
As for Carranza. administration

for withdrawal. He might object to

WASHINGTON, May €.—With the
official text of the German reply be
fore him today. President Wilson is
formulating his decision on whether
or not Germany has met lAirierica
squarely on the submarine issue.
Unless the official document, dis
patched by Ambassador Gerard, dif
fers in essential points, it is practical
ly a foregone conclusion that all dan
ger of an immediate break with Ger
many has passed. This conclusion
has the general approval of congress,
the cabinet and others of the presi
dent's advlBers. From a great num
ber Of telegrams received at the
white Jionse during the night, it ap
pears the' eountry also is satisfied'
that Germany has made a concession
precluding all possibility of a break
—unless she falls to live up to her
promise.
belief has grown strong that peace
may have played a prominent part in
that conference.
Germany's admission that she has
'•twice offered to make peace, her dec
laration that she yields t» the presi
dent's demands 'because she believes
it would be a calamity if the war
were prolonged or increased in scope
—these positions if not actual indi
cations of uneasiness over the future,
are at least appeals to this country
for affirmative steps that will stop
the carnage, according to expressed
belief in German circles as well as
administration quart era.
'.ily.,'. -t:'^' Cv ''//"^...V'-' ''-J
It may be said with authority that
some of those close in the councils of
the president believe he sbould and
may tentatively sound out the war
ring powers on the question of pbef
sible peace as a result of the German
note. One of tiiese men said today:'
"We hear in this (the German re
ply) not the voice of the braggaxd or
bully—tout the voice of a nation sick
and tired of the endless fight. It is
the heart and soul of Germany speak
ing what it feels.
"From all the countries at war, we
read every day of some indication
that the conflict is becoming an in
tolerable burden. Perhaps tills la.
the time to move for its end.**
The president has for more than a
year declined to volunteer his serv
ices in the cause of peace. Until
such action was suggested to Mm by
one of the Countries fighting, it has
been understood he would make no
move. This suggestion, in the minds
of many here, has now come. 'Wheth
er or not the president regards it in
this light, remains to be seen.
Much probably depends on what
Ambassador Gerard 'has communi
cated as to his conference with
Kaiser Wllhehn at grand army head
quarters.
The contents of that highly con
fidential communication are being
closely guarded for the time being.
In the meantime the president will
do nothing in this direction until he
determines whether he can with dig
nity accept the new German pledge,
as 'wholly apart from its discussion
of the British blockade.
The official text of the note, de
coded this morning, was described by
one official after a first reading as
practically identical with the text as
carried In press dispatches.

of warfare. They united in the dec
laration that the British government
will not allow itself to be made a
party in such a three angled diplo
matic game.
The only paragraph of the German
note that brought satisfaction to Lon
don today was Germany's declaration
that her concessions to the United
States were made to prevent the pro
longation of the war. Critics seized
upon this as an admission that G•
many, despite the utterances of the
Von Tirpitzites, is seriously alarmed
over the efTect of America's entrance
into the war on the side of the allies.
The Express declared the German
reply was an insult to American in
justice and added that Germany was
attempting to force the LTnited States
to obtain concessions from Great
Britain by threatening to stop muni
tions shipments.
The Morning Post and Daily Chron
