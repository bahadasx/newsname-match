Washington, May C Whllo tho fi
nal decision on tho attltudo of the
American government wnlts on tho of
flclnl text, somo cabinet mcmbors Indi
cated that the dcrman assurances
probably would ba accepted and that
diplomatic rotations would not be
broken unless tho order to submarlno
commanders was violated nnd Ameri
can lives endangered.
Washington, May 6. President Wil
son and tho cabinet wont carefully
over tho German noto ns transmitted
In nows dispatches from Berlin.
A first fooling that It was unsatls
factory, was somewhat leavened by
the text of the new orders to subma
rlnc commanders, although It was
foreseen that tho rcferetico to ltmnu
nlty for merchant ships recognized by
International law might admit of some
dispute of Interpretation.
So much depends upon words and
their shades of meaning Involved In
translation from Gorman to English
that no decision can, bo attempted until
tho official text Is In tho President's
hands.
When the cabinet meeting broke up
Secretary Lansing met nil Inquiries
with this reply:
"I can not discuss It at all at this
time."
All tho other members of the cab
inct mado similar statements. It was
mado plain that President Wilson
would dccldo after studying the off!
clal text.
At tho State Department, after the
cabinet meeting, It was stated that no
"hasty" uctlon would be taken on tho
German note, and that In vlow of Us
length and tho necessity of digesting
It cnrofully, it was "Improbable" that
any decision would bo reached beforo
next week.
Tho cabinet was in session two
hours and a half tho longest meeting
held In several months.
Mombers of tho cablnot were un
communicative, all saying that no fur
ther steps would bo taken until the or
flclal text was placed before President
Wilson.
Tho private view of officials appar
ently was that the new orders to sub
marine commanders apparently met
the demands of tho United States un
less an Interpretation wcro placed on
them to lead to attack on merchant
vessels armed for defensivo purposes
Tho general tenor of the Gorman note,
however, was considered unsatlsfac
tory.
Ambassador Gerard cabled jester
day that ho had started It on the cables
and that It should be In wushlngton
tonight.
