MITCHELL MAY GO NORTH.
Manager of La Cobriza Interested
New Mining Syndicate.
The Arizona Gazette of recent
date says:
Rumors are afloat of the pro
spective organization of what
promises to become the largest
copper mining syndicate in the
state of Arizona.
The property which will form
the base ot operations of the
company is not a new one. It is
located in the northern part of
the state and according to re
ports is of great magnitude,
nature performing considerable
development work in exposing
immense bodies of copper ore.
Locators in doing their annual
assessments have also added to
the development, and there is re
ported to be a sufficient amount
of ore already in sight to justify
the immediate erection of a re
duction plant and keep it in
operation for many months with
out any further development.
The. ore is a combination of
silicate and carbonates aud is
identical in character with the
ores ol the ivjo district, except
where that runs from one per
cent to two or three, this ore
runs irom lour ana twelve to as
high as twenty. Treated by the
same leaching process used at
Ajo, and which was developed by
the Cornelia company, copper
can be turned-out at less cost
than by any other copper com
pany in the state.
Among the local men interest
ed in the enterprise is Robt. Mit
chell, manager of the La Cobriza
mine in Mexico, south of No
gales and one of the best known
and most experienced copper
smelting men in the state. It is
he that introduced the converter
system at the smelter of the
United Verde mines at Jerome
ana lie nas been successful 1&4
every enterprise he has ever
been associated with from the
fact that he carelully looks into
the possibilities of a property be
fore identifying himself with it.
According by W. E. Defty, an-
otner conservative local mining
engineer, Mitchell will shortly
visited the property and make
examination of it with a view of
determining the details concern
ing its further development, and
the equipment required for re
ducing the ore to a marketable
product.
Unlike many copper properties
no smelter will be required, and
the leaching plant can be placed
upon it in a very short time, so
that the active production of
copper can be commenced at a
very mucu earlier date than
where a smelter is required.
A number of New York capi
talists have become interested in
the enterprise so that while it is
yet euibryo, the future success
seems assured.
The legal affairs are being
looked after by Joseph E. Mor
rison, who has acted in this ca
pacity io" some of the largest
mining corporations now in
operation in Arizona.
