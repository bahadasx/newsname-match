BRIDGEPORT
POPULATION
IS 150,000
DeVer H. Warner Estimates
It At That Figure Pre
dicts Great' Future For
Park City and Sees An
nexation of Stratfield and
West Stratford.
Prosperity Won't End With
War, Declares Manufac
turer, Preparing For New
Conditions Employers
Who Haven't Improved
Conditions Will Have to.
Bridgeport has a population
of 150,000 persons, according
to DeVer H. Warner, head of
the Warner Bros. Co.
The prosperity of Bridgeport
is permanent, according to the
same authority. "After the
War, Bridgeport will settle
down to a calm, stable and per
manent prosperity," declared
Mr. Warner today. ' - -
Bridgeport will embrace
West Stratford and that section
of Fairfield in the neighbor
hood of Tunxis hill, Mr. War
ner believes. -
Those manufacturers who
didn't meet the new conditions
voluntarily last summer by im
proving wages and working
conditions, will have -to do - it
before long, he declares. '
Speaking from observations and
calculations made because of his con
nection with the biggest corset' factory
in the world, the water1 and gas com
panies that control distribution houses
these commodities -- in Bridgeport,
with the banks and business houses
of the city, Mr. Warner 1 prophesied a
great future for the Park' Qity. :.
Mrrwarntr sara: : .
"It-is rather difficult to estimate a
population under such conditions as
prevail in Bridgeport, but the con
sumption of : commodities, develop
ments, trade and 'banking enable one
to arrive at a fairly accurate figure.
"I made a computation a short
time - ago and as a result, I believe
Bridgeport now has 150,000 persons.
"In The Farmer a year ago, before
the great onrush of population ar
rived, , I expressed the opinion that
Bridgeport would have 200,000 per
sons in six years. , It is my belief now
that that, figure will be reached long
before that time.'
"There are many things that enter
into the computation. The chief is
the business of the . banks. A fairly
accurate estimate- of the number of
persons who have come here, leaving
their families behind, may 'be' made
from the amount of money that is
sent out of town.
"The money , that Is drawn from
the banks for payrolls isn't coming
back' now. It will, later, when the
families of these men arrive and set-
tfe here. ; This will occur as soon as
the housing facilities can catch up
to the increase.
"The stores aren't getting the money
now,, either, that ' is the stores that
cater to women. The men's furnish
ing stores are getting more business.
. These families,5 the heads of which
are in Bridgeport, will come to this
city. While the housing situation is
inadequate now, it will De onangea,
and when the big development plans
that are now being made, are carried
out, the supply will meet the demand.
"Tremendous quantities of furniture
stored in the eity. The families
are out of town, waiting a chance to
get a home here. . '
"The consumption OI waier aim Ba
indicates the increase. The consump
tion of water increased 6,000,000 gal
lons a day last month. Bridgeport is
irvw usine 32.000.000 gallons a day. It
used to be 18,000,000 to 20,000,000 gallons
sl J.3iy
"Consumption of gas has increased
between 40 and 50 percent.
"All this ; Is now transient. Aixer
the war there will be a slump, a short
one, while the great ehanges due to
the diminishing munitions business
are taking plaOs. A new and. perma
nent prosperity will follow and Bridge
port will be a great city. , -
"Any prosperity,- no matterwhere it
is, is bound to bring' prosperity to
Bridgeport. This is because of the
variety of manufactures. The muni
tions business is but one of the man
ufactures and plays, like the other in
dividual businesses, a small part.
"When money comes to Bridgeport,
it comes - from all over the world.
Money will pour into Bridgeport from
all over the world after the -war.
"Those men who leave the muni
tions factories will be taken by the
other manufacturers.
"The labor situation here is as good
as in any otherbig city. The man
ufacturers who did r.ot- meet the de
mands for improvement last summer
voluntarily will Have to do so before
long." "
Concerning the probable expansion
of Bridgeport, Mr. Warner said:
"That section of the Brooklawri
district about Tunxis hill should be
part of Bridgeport, ' ' and so should
West Stratford. I believe they will
be before long."

KING'S BUSINESS
DEALINGS AGAIN
AIRED IN COURT
Acted as Agent For Two
Parties to Deal by Which
Both Claim Loss'es.
THOUSANDS HINGE
J UPON SETTLEMENT
Bank Gets No Mortgage and
Home Owner and Mort
gaged Person No Case.
As a result of operations that re
sulted in imprisonment for Clitus H.
King, a. former attorney in this city,
equity in many thousand dollars" worth
of property has become involved in
legal complication. I
It is learned that disputes over prop
erty estimated between $35,000 and
$50,000 in value hinge upon settlement
of a common pleas court suit between
the Ridgefleld Savings bank an
Thomas Sherwood of Fairfield. The
settlement will involve fine distinc
tions of the relationship at law be
tween master and servant. . '
Epitomized the test cast is substan
tially this: The Ridgefleld Savings
bank was a client of CUtus King.
Sherwood "was likewise a client.. In
the negotiations thatresulted King in
each case acted as agent for the op
posing factions. Sherwood asked King
to raise a mortgage. The Ridgefleld
bank employed King to place the
mortgage loan of about $1,000. - .The
actual cash was placed In the hands
of King by the Ridgefleld bank for
Sherwood. Sherwood gave a note" and
mortgage on his" house through King
for the Ridgefleld Savings bank. , As
a result of misappropriation of funds
a mortgage stands' against Sherwood
for moneys never received and $1,000
has been placed ' out by the bank for
which it has never received a mort
gage. To all appearances both Sher
wod and the bank are innocent - par
ties, both of whom claim have lost
through the agent of the other. King,
the Original agent, by reason of his
imprisonment has dropped out of sight
in the transaction.
This case is said to be one of nearly
30 similar peases and the1 courts .will be
called upon to decide the equity.

DOWRY LACKING,
IRE OF MOTHER
ROUSED, HE SAYS
Dentist Gives Statement' As
to Why She Now Seeks
To Evict Him.
ACTION MAY CAUSE
SPLIT IN CHURCH
Dr. Schwartz Says Mother
Wants To Get Back Cost
of His Education.
The dower question as applied to
marriages in America by descendents
of wealthy European families is not
only the basis of the suit brought to
evict him from his present dental
quarters at the corner of Main street
and Fairfield avenue, but is widening
the breach between the orthodox and
reformed constituents of the Jewish
church, according to .Dr. J. W.
Schwartz.
The following notice of summary
proceedings filed in the city court by
Theodore E. Steiber; representing Mrs.
Emma Schwartz of Yonkers, mother
of the young Bridgeport dentist, it
was learned that the marriage of Dr.
Schwartz, to Miss Lillian Graves,
daughter of the Fairfield avenue Jew
eler, was one of the causes of the
legal proceedings.
Particulars of the case were learn
ed .when Dr. Schwartz made matters
clear in statements issued today.
The Jewish - professional man's
great trouble in America' today is the
dowry v system that existed abroad.
The older, orthodox families who have
removed to this country, look upon
their professional , sons in the same
light that the European resident
would. In Europe it is high honor
to possess a son engaged in a profes
sion. For him io marry without a
dower is most unconventional.
"Though there is not a whisper
against my matrimonial choice,' and
my mother was pleased at the time of
the wedding, she was under the belief
that an ante-nuptial agreement with
dow-er shad been settled. When she
learned to the contrary ahe began
this trouble which is . today through
out America causing a wide breach in
the Orthodox faith.
"My mother holds the lease for the
offices I occupy in the United building.
a part of which I sublet to my broth
er-in-law. She has brought this evic
tion suit and has added "the cost of
i myxcollege education,- which she paid
Xersnd. I might almost say,"" that she
has added the complete cost of rear
ing me from infancy."
' Dr. Schwartz will contest the evic
tion suit and has ordered his attorney.
Thomas M. Cullinan, . to oppose the
issue vigorously.

ers Bernstorff, Back in Capital, Maintains
Silence.
Washington, May, 6 The official text of Germany's note,
fully decoded and laid before President Wilson today, shows
no material differences from the Unofficial text published
yesterday in news despatches. This strengthens the proba
bility that a diplomatic break has been averted at least for the
present.
Overnight study of the note by cabi- .
net members and officials did not
change, their view that probably there
would be no break in diplomatic rela
tions unless there were further attacks
in violation of international law.
There is a nossibilitv that the United
States may make, a brlef'reply notify
ing the Berlin government that as long
as the new orders to submarnle com
manders are fully observed diplomatic
relations will not be discontinued on
that score.
Secretary Lansing already has stud
ied the note once and was going over
it very carefully again today. There
were indications that further consid
eration by the cabinet would not be
necessary.
Count Von Bernstorff , ' the German
ambassador, returned to the embassy

gives a prominent place in today's
issue to a long despatch from' Rotter
dam, asserting that there is a strong
belief in Holland that the German,
note to the United States was care
fully prepared in the hope that it
may lead eventually to peace negotia
tions. .
The despatch says in part:
"There is a belief here that behind
the whole cloud of vague and condi
tional premises lies the hope that
negotiations for peace will be opened
with England througli the mediation
of the United States. ' According- to
this View Germany hopes that Wash
ington will open a discussion first on
the questions of contraband and the
naval blockade which will widen by
easy stages to eventual discussion bf
possible peace conditions.
"In American circles in Berlin it
is believed that Ambassador Gerard,
during his recent visit to the Kaiser's
headquarters at the front, discussed
matters far wider in .range than
merely the questions at issue between
Berlin and Washington."

B. II. S. SENIORS
TO HAVE.FIflERY
FOR qRADUAMJ
Graduating Class Votes to
Do Away With Cap and
Gown Custom.
i -
Staid caps and gowns have been
abandoned in favor ofthe flashier 1916
Vogue and Kuppenheimer models by
the sweet girl and boy graduates of
Bridgeport high school, class of 1916.
THe seniors met, this week, and after
considerable debate decided to revert
to the go-as-you-please method in the
matter of graduation dress.
A year ago, the seniors, in the in
terest of economy, decided that gradu
ation frills in dress should be abolish
ed. The cap and gown were substi
tuted. According to reports from the sen
ior class meetingthe girls of the class
were leaders in the movement to abol
ish the cap and gown. Several took
issue with boys who defended the
regime instituted last year. When
a vote came, it was found that the
caps and gowns had been routed by a
big vote. '
The seniors also decided to Intro
duce something new in the graduation
festivities this year in the form of a
banquet. The banquet was first pro
posed as a substitute for the senior
dance, but the devotees of terpMchore
fought it off on that basis. They were
willing, however, to have the banquet
as an extra added attraction and it will
be held, probably In the school, on
the night of Senior Day .
Characteristic day will be held at
one. of the beaches on May 19, and a.
class picnic will also be Included in the
graduation parties. John Geaney has
been elected class prophet; Miss Mar
ion Meigs, class historian; and Ray
mond Eastwood, class poet. The class
photographs will be by Haley.
