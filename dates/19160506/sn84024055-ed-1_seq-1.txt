DEATH AND FUNKKAT. OF ANDBEW J. GBAHAM, THE WEST SIDE
MELLIONAIBE BANKER,. WHO WAS VEBY POPULAR AND MUCH
BELOVED BY ALL CLASSES OF HIS FELLOW CITIZENS.
The politicians of both parties that
is the Democrats and the Bepublicans
have been mighty busy the past week
for the aids and the followers of the
Hon. Eoger C. Sullivan can clear away
from former Carter H. Harrison and
his few dwindling camp followers and
left the five times mayor hanging
high and dry when it comes down to
selecting the committee to manage the
affairs of the Democratic party in Cook
County, and it is very strange when we
come to think of it that at this very
time the Sullivan and Harrison are
getting ready to do some, cutting, and
carving and fight each other to the
death while on the other hand the
three fighting or wrangling of the Ee
publican party are getting together
and are loving each other much better
than fighting like cats and dogs for
the first of this week it was possible
for those who follow the Hon. Charles
S. Deneen those who trail after the
Hon. Edward J. Brundage and those
who swore by-Mayor William Hale
Thompson to crowd into the red or gold
or silver room at the Hotel La Salle
and after much hot talk or chewing
the rag on their part the following
harmony judicial ticket to be vote for
at the June Judicial election for Judges
of the Superior Court, was brought
forth to the light of day.
For the Full term. Judge Eobert E.
Turncy, Twenty-fifth ward; George A.
Pupuy, Twenty-sixth wardj Hosea W.
"Wells, Eighteenth wardj Eobert E.
Orowc, Thirteenth ward; Henry TJt
patel, Fifteenth ward; Edward J.
Heredlicks, Thirty-fourth ward.
To fill Vacancy. Andrew J. Bed
luon.l, Oak Park, (for place vacated
by Judgo H. V. Freeman).
"When the Judicial convention came
lo an end everything seemed to indi
cate that at the meeting of the com
mittee next Thursday that the Hon.
"William H. "Weber will be chosen
chairman of the county committee.
Many of the leading Eepublican can
didates for president of the United
Stales are engaged in opening up their
headquarters in the big hotels in the
downtown district; Senator Lawrence
Y. bhtrman will hold forth in the gold
room in the Congress Hotel. The Fair
lans headquarters will be held in the
I'njilkh room the Congress; Senator
I'nm.uins' Presidential boom will bo
nurtured in the oak room on the mez
zauino floor. Senator Weeks of Massa
chusetts and the Bay State delegation
tu11 hive the Presidential suite. The
ew York delegation has engaged B6
and B.S. Pennsylvania the green room,
ad Henry D. Estabrook, rooms 1112
!. all in tho Congress.
As the time is fast approaching for
holding tho Eepublican National , Con
yention in this city, Tuesday June 7,
is almost an even bet .at the present
time that Col. Theodore Eoosevolt will
rwcive the nomination for president
the United States.
there is one happy man in this
wide world, that man is the Hon. Wil
liam Lorimer for after every attempt
had been made by those who do not
entertain one bit of love for him, to
force him to efld his days in "tho Pen
at Joliet, he was acquitted by a Jury
in Judge William E. Dover's Court in
the Criminal Court Building late on
Wednesday night and he was given
a clean bill of sale as being not guilty
of attempting to wreck the La Salle
Street Trust and Savings Bank and
after heartily thanking each member of
the Jury for permitting him to walk
out of the court a free man; he ex
claimed that "if he lived he would pay
back within two years time to each
and every person every dollar which
they had lost through the failure of
the La Salle Street Trust and Savings
Bank" at the same time he let it be
known that he would enter the race
for United States from Illinois in 1918.
Thousands of the many friends of
Hon. Miles J. Devine are urging him
to enter the race for State's Attorney
of Cook County and they are after him
every day to come out in the open and
declare himself a candidate for that
office if he should decide to make the
race the police would be with him to
a man, for at all times he has been
their true friend and hundreds of times
without pay he has defended them in
the courts and won their suits or cases
for them, aside from this fact he has a
strong personal following and he is
well-known to the voters in every nook
and corner throughout Cook county and
being an eminent lawyer he would
make an ideal candidate.
The first part of this week Andrew
J. Graham, the West Side millionaire
banker closed his eyes in death and he
was very popular and much beloved by
all classes of his fellow citizens his
funeral on Thursday was one of the
very largest ever held in the city.
Thousands and thousands of those who
knew him best in life gazed upon his
remains in his home at 3340 West
Washington Boulevard and thousands
were unable to enter it in order to get
tho last look at him, more than one
thousand autos were in the funeral pro
cession; the funeral services were held
in St. Mathew's Boman Catholic
Church, Walnut Street and North Al
bany Ave.
Bishop Mnldoon of Eockford, Illinois
preached tho funeral sermon and he
spoke in part as follows:
"The church brings people together
to pray for tho dead and to meditate
on death and thereby prepare for the
great day. It is entirely proper to
speak of the virtues of the dead
that men may be attracted by them.
"I am happy to speak unreservedly
of Mr. Graham as a thoroughly good
man.
"First, Mr. Graham, who unaided,
reached Ms position, is an excellent
example to the young men of Chicago,
giving evidence that perseverance,
fidelity to duty and so forth, will bring
success."
"Second, he offered a splendid ex
ample to the business man, for he
crushed no one, trampled on no one
while amassing his fortune. Again,
he spread charity on his way and
thereby returned to God a tithe of
what he had received.
"Third, ho was a religious man and
lived a really supernatural life. While
wishing everyone to serve God as he
pleased, he was a most devout Catho
lic and thereby taught the world that
man must depend upon God and seek
His blessing.
"The need of America in his day
of great catastrophes, of great wars
and strikes and bitternesses is thor
oughly religious professional men.
What an example he was to theml
"It would be an intrusion to say
aught of his tender and sacred love
for his family. This Christian gen
tleman lived and worked in your midst.
The following priests assisted in the
funeral services:
Eev. James F. Flood was the cele
brant of mass; Bev. Phillip F. Fur
long was deacon, Bev. Daniel Byrnes

NATIONAL NEWS NOTES.
Brief Bits of News and Comments On
Men and Women.
SEGBEGATION BECEIVES BLACK
EYE.
Court Halts Enforcement of Negro
Isolation Ordinance in St. Louis.
St. Louis, Mo. Enforcement of tho
segregation ordinance of St. Louis was
enjoined by the Federal District Court
here todaj Tho injunction was grant
ed by District Judge Dyer, who said he
made the order temporary,- only be
cause the Federal Supreme Court now
is considering a segregation case from
Louisville, Ky.; otherwise, he says, ho
would have made tho injunction permanent.
One section of the ordinance pro
hibits Whites or Blacks from living in
a block in which 75 per cent of tho
houses are occupied by persons of tho
opposite race. Judge Dyer said: "The
Negro is entitled to the same consid
eration and the same rights as is a
White man. The Negro doesn't want
social equality. He wants tho same
rights beforo the law as the Whito
man and ho should have them." This
is strong language!
s
augurated a campaign for a prohibition
amendment to the State Constitution,
and the election returns show what the
Ycrmonters think about it. The anti
prohibitionists carried every county in
the state, with the single exception of
Orleans County.
The result of the election was a
shock to the Anti-Saloon League de
structionists. They have not yet been
able to figure out how they were so
thoroughly, thrashed at the polls. The
Anti-Saloon League leaders pursued
their usual tactics of attempting to in
timidate the citizens who had the nerve
to oppose them. Even newspapers that
opposed prohibition were threatened
with boycotts. These tactics were re
sented by tho people and helped to
swell tho anti-prohibition majority.
A PLAIN SPEAKING METHODIST
BISHOP.
SIGNIFICANT VERMONT VOTE.
Montpelier, Vermont Tho voters of
Vermont, at an election just held, de
feated a prohibition amendment to tho
Constitution by a majority of several
thousand. Vermont is a small state,
and the vote cast on the prohibition
amendment was 18,503 for and 31,667
against. The"" result of tho Vermont
election is significant. It shows that
the prohibition agitation has reached
its high tide and that it is now turning
back in the other direction.
Vermont experimented with prohibi
tion for several years and found that
it was a failure and a fraud. The
prohibition law was repealed, and li
cense and regulation substituted in
1903. Recently the prohibitionists in-
Boston, Mass. Bishop John W. Ham
ilton of the Methodist Episcopal
Church, North, has decided to retire
from active service when the General
Conference of his church meets at Sar
atoga Springs, New York, next month.
Bishop Hamilton has always been a
strong friend and advocate of the Negro.
In an address some years ago in
Washington, District of Columbia, at
the National Capital, when he was
Bishop of San Francisco, ho created
a sensation by declaring that tho typi
cal American of the future would be
born of tho amalgamation of all tho
races that now inhabit this continent.
Anglo-Saxons of today, he declared,
would be the grand-parents or great
grandparents of men and women partly
Chinese and Japanese and Russian Jew
and Southern European and African.
His theory was received in absolute
silence and many of the audience, sup
pressing their resentment, abruptly left
Metropolitan Church, in which he was
speaking.
