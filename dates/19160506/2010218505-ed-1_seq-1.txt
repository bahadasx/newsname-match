not averted a. diplomatic break with
tho United States. President "Wilson
will make hie decision after ho re
ceives the official tex,*, which . ar
rived from ferlin from Ambassador
Gerard tonight. It should be before
President Wilson tomorrow.
It was stated authoritatively ofter
tho cabinet meeting today that if the
offlciul text bore out the unoflicial
press version that Germany's as
surances undoubtedly would bo ac
copted'. Before taking another atop
tho United States would await the
fulfillment of Germany's latest pro
mises. In such a case the United 1
Slates might not reply, but await |
evideucea !fo? Germany's abandon
ment of prcment methods of sub
marino .-warfare. .Pr?sident Wilson
is described ..as being in. a position
where he-cannot question Germany's
good faith. ;

Congress took the note quietly, tho
general sentiment seeming, to favor
leaving all to President Wilson.
While cabinet members, who went I
over tho unofficial version with the I
president today declined to discuss
?tho note, they indicated that a break
had been averted. The reflected tho|
view that Germany would bo accord
ed a tes', of lilac despite Germany's
roferonco to the action she expects
tho United tates; to tago aga/ J? Great
Britain's restraint of neutrat trade.
At tho state department after the
cabinet meeting only two things were
made pisar; They were that Gio
United Staten still holds to its de
termination that "mistakes" of sub
marine commanders aro not admissa
hle; also,, tho United' States must
continue to regard the discussion of
conduct of Other belligerents as lr-,
ToleyHnt to tho ilscussion of Ger
many'*; conduct. It stated also that
the United States >may ask Germany
for. the original orders given' Gorman
submarino command en; to see how
they compare with the order given in
the note requiring commanders to
visit, end search ships. whiiih do not
resist or do not try to O3capo.
