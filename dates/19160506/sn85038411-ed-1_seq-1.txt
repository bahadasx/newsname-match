BELIEF THAT BREAK

REFERENCE TO U. S. PEACE TERMS CAREFULLY
CONSIDERED; MAY MAKE BRIEF ANSWER
Will Indicate That So Long as New Orders to Submarine
Commanders Are Fully Observed Relations Will Not
Be Severed on That Score
By Associated Press ,
■Washington. D. C., May <">. The
official text of German's note, fully
decoded and laid before President
Wilson shows no material difference,
from the unofficial text published yes- j
terday in news dispatches. This
strengthens the probability that a
diplomatic break lias been averted, at
least for the present.
Overnight study of the note by;
Cabinet members and officials did not;
change their views that probably there
would be no break in diplomatic rela
tions unless there were further at
tacks In violation of international
law.
There is a possibility that the Untied
States may make a brief reply notify
ing the Berlin government that as
long as the new orders to submarine
commanders are fully observed diplo-j
matic relations will not be discon- j
tinucd on that score.
Secretary Lansing already has
Studied the note once and was goinE
over it very carefully again to-day.
There were indications that further
consideration by the cabinet would
not he necessary.
Carefully Heads I'oac*- Portion
President Wilson read to-day with:
careful attention the portion of the j
note touching on peace. Some officials
believed unusual significance should
be attached to that part of the nole
because it was taken to indicate offl
cially that recent speeches of Chan
i eller von Rethtnann-Hollweg before
the relchstag were intended as no
tices to the world that Germany was
ready for peace on certain terms.
The note says: "The German gov- i
ernment, conscious of Germany's \
strength, twice within the last few
months announced before the world
it.; readiness to make peace on a basis j
■safeguarding Germany's vital interests.'
thus indicating it is not Germany's
fault if peace is still withheld from the
nations of Europe."
While it was indicated to-day that |
President Wilson would make no fur
ther peace moves until the allied gov
ernments have signified their willing
ness to receive suggestions on the sub
ject. some officials thought 10-day (he
German note might possibly draw
forth something from the allies.
Here Are the Demands of
the United States and Way
Germany Has Met Them
The specific demands of the United
r.afes and the manner in which Ger
many meets them are as follows:
The United Slates I Minimum
If it Is still the purpose of the Im
perial Government to prosecute re
ientlesa and indiscriminate warfare
against vessels of commerce by the
use of submarines without regard to
What the Government of the United
Slates must consider the sacred and
indisputable rules of international
law and the universally recognised
dictates of humanity, the Govern
ment. of the United States is at last
forced to the conclusion that ihere
is but one course it can pursue.
Unless the Imperial Government
should now Immediately declare and
effect an abandonment of its present
methods of submarine warfare against
passenger and freight-carrying vessels,
the Government of the United Stales
"•an have no choice but to sever diplo
matic relations with the German Em
pire altogether.
Again and again the Imperial Gov
ernment. has given its solemn assur
ance to the Government of the United
States that at least passenger ships
would not be thus dealt with, and yet
it has repeatedly permitted its under
sea commanders to disregard those
assurances with entire impunity.
The German Reply
The German Government, guided
by this idea notifies the Government
of the United States that German
naval forces have received the follow
ing order:
