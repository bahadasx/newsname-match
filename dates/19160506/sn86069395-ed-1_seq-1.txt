If the Kaiser doesn't watch out
we'll quit being neutral.
It is now up to the President to add
an "off" to Bcrnstorff.
A vote on the J3randeis nomination
will bo reached next week.
Wheat has dropped two or three
cents more, closing at $1.13.
The Kaiser evidently thinks Bcrns-
torff is troubled with nostalgia.
Former Governor Ben W. Hooper,
twice elected Governor of Tennessee
by. Democratic votes, is the Republi
can nominee for Senator.
Isaac Loan, or Mt. Vernon, ma., is
being tried on an arson charge, the
principal witnesses against him being
Charles Griffith's Sebree, Ky. blood
hounds, which took the trail straight
from a burning barn to Coan's house,
Tomorrow has been set apart as the
great Go-To-Sunday-School day in
Kentucky and it should be observed
in a spirit of endorsement that will
crowd all churches and Sunday School
rooms to their utmost capacity. Age
does not count in this matter. The
young and the old should vie with
each other in their determination to
j attend and also to take somebody with
jTthem. Try it one Sunday, anyhow.
,,vIt.will do you good.
England's summary execution of
the Irish patriots who headed the
Dublin revolt, will not make the Irish
soldiers in the trenches fight any
harder. A little mercy to Pearse,
who voluntarily surrendered, and
called upon his followers to do so,
would have gone a long way towards
winning back the misguided rebels at
a time when England needs brave
men at the front. As it is, Pearse is
likely to go down in Irish history as
another Robert Emmett.
Speaking of laymen reminds us that
" Aubrey Tuggle used to tell a fable of
a mother hen that, had 12 chickens,
6 pullets and 6 roosters. The flock
was owned by a Methodist sister who
proudly showed them to her friends
when they were following the mother
hen. Late in the fall a Methodist
conference came that way. The fol
lowing sprfhg, when the flock was
rounded up, only the pullets remain
ed. When the mother hen was asked
to explain why some of them were
missing, she said: "Thosojittle roost
ers of mine after they got from under
my wing were not fit for laymen and
so they all WENT INTO THE MIN
ISTRY,' j

TWO QUEER
ACCIDENTS
Limbs Fractured Seemingly
Without Any Cause
At AH.
Two peculiar accidents occurred in
the city this week, resulting in the
fracture of limbs.
Mrs. Haliie E. Reynolds, who
makes her home at Judge W. P. Win
free's, fractured her hip Monday in
the effort of arising from a chair in
which she was sitting. Just how she
twisted it so as to cause the fracture
was a mystery. She was taken to the
Stuart Hospital for treatment.
The other accident was to Henry
Rex, of East Thirteenth street, who
unbalanced himself in some way
while standing, causing one of the
bones in his leg to snap. His injury
was promptly attended and he is do
ing well.
DEATH OF MRS. DOEITV.
Mrs. Frances W. Dority, wife of
Ralph Dority, formerly of Pembroke,
died in Nashville a few days ago..
The deceased was a daughter of the
late Joseph H. Williams and was
reared near Pembroke, removing to
Nashville some years ago, where Mr.
Dority is engaged in business.
Besides her husband she is survived
by two sons, the younger an infant,
and her mother, Mrs. M. JE. Williams,
a sister, Miss Ethel Williams, and a
brother, John H. Williams. The re
mains were brought to Pembroke for
interment.
Mr. John Callard, aged 75, father
of Fred Callard, of this city, disap
peared from his home at London,
Ontario, Canada, a week ago and has
not been found. His son has gone
to Canada to assist in searching
for him. He was a retired druggist
and was at Port Stanley with a fish
ing party. He was last seen near the
lake and it is believed that he fell in
and was drowned. Tho water was
12 feet deep and it will be difficult to
recover his body.

against trenches which the French re

big guns, however, have not ceased
their activity on various sectors. A
very violent bombardment is reported
in the region of. hill 304, northwest
of Verdun.

shells in great numbers against the

1908 will come Sunday, Juno 4, to

tation was extended to Dr. Jenkins
soveral weeks ago, but only recently
was he ablo to mako his arrange
ments to come, postponing the meet
ing from the middle of May to the
first Sunday in June. Dr. Jenkens
was very popular with the people

Berlin, May 5. James W. Gerard
the American ambassador to Ger
many, last night called on Hcrr von
Jagow, the German foreign minister,
to receive from him GcrinalTy's reply
to the American note concerning sub
marine warfare.
The chancellor, with Admiral von
Holtzendorff, head of the naval gen
eral staff; Dr. Karl Helfferich, the
secretary of the treasury and other
participants in the council, returned
to Berlin early in the morning.
The note with its explanation of tho
German attitude toward the British
"starvation" policy will be one of tho
longest diplomatic documents of the
war. It will be released for publica
tion here, in probability this morning.
Washington, D. C, May 5. It
was reiterated that Presfdent Wil
son stood unaltered by the position
declared in the note to Germany
that the abandonment of present sub
marine methods must be declared and
effected immediately or the United
States must sever diplomatic rela
tions. This demand was designed to
permit of no argument and high of
ficials repeatedly have asserted that
anything short of a literal compliance
would be followed by a diplomatic
rupture.
The official copy of the note hardly
will reach Washington before to-night
but the document was given to the
press in Berlin jate List night and the
unoffirial text was expected to reach
the United States early this morning.
Ambassador Gerard's message was
sent before he had examined the note
itself. Its meaning was not entirely
clear because of , errors in transmis
sion of the diplomatic cipher.
Secretary Lansing declined to com
ment on the message or make it pub
lic because lie feared it was garbled
or that Mr. Gerard not havintr seen
the note itself, might have made inac
curate deductions. Furthermore, the
ambassador had indicated that his
message must be regarded as being
highly confidential.
