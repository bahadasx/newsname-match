VOL. XL COLFAX, GRANT PARISH, LA., SATURDAY, MAY 6, 1916 NUMBER
Congress to Consider Roads
Proposition for Federal Government to Build and Main
tain Entirely Certain Highways, Relieving Coun
ties of Part of Their Present Burdens.
Washington, May 3.-Provision
for an investigation and report
to Congress of a preliminary
plan for a system of national
highways by the corps of engi
neers of the army is made in a
joint bill now pending before the
Senate and House committees on
military affairs. The bill was
introduced in the Senate by Sen
ator John A. Shields, of .Tennes
see, and in the House by Repre
sentative John H. Small, of North
Carolina.
In particular this bill embodies
the principle of having conducted I
a scientific investigation and sur- I
vey of the highway routes upon
which federal funds are to be ex- I
pended before the work of con- i
struction is begun. It seeks, it I
is said, to prevent the hit or miss I
building of roads by the Federal E
Government which are located, t
not by expert surveys, but by i
local political influence-roads 5
which begin anywhere within al
State and end nowherp in par- li
ticular. The danger of having
federal funds for good roads ex
pended in such fashion has al- a
ready caused the dangerous cry a
"pork" to be raised in Con
grthe good rdads ap
propriation bifs under dis- c
cussion. - it
Under the terms of the Shields- g,
Small bill, the Federal Govern- g'
ment would devote its funds and al
energies solely to the construc- 2
tion of main or trunk line high
way units connecting and corre
lating the highway systems with
in the States. Instead of pro
viding funds to pay a part of the
State's bills on State roads, the
Federal Government would take 5
over, to build and maintain en
tirely, certain of the principal
highways. That would relieve
the States of a considerable part
of their present burden and
would allow them to devote more mo
money to the building of more
miles of good roads radiating r
from the Federal highways. ho
Counties would then build good 11
roads radiating from the State
highways, while townships or in- an
dividuals would build good roads me
feeding the county highways. n
Thus the entire country would be of
woven together by a network of l
highways each system feeding of
the other, as is done by the rail- "
ways. pa]
The Shields-Small bill was ;'
drawn by Mr. Cyrus Kehr, of to
Knoxville, Tenn., a member of foil
the National Highways Associa- A
tion, in co-operation with Sena
tor Shields and Representative o
Small, and engineer officers on Al
duty at the War Department.
It has been approved by the War i
Department. While the bill em
bodies two of the principles for '
which the National Highways .
Association has contended in its
good roads campaign, it is not ,,
particularly supported by the as
sociation which thus far has lent add
its support to principles only and .
not to any particular piece of a
legislation.
That this effort to have Con- t;
gress provide a preliminary high
way plan prepared according to
recognized principles of engineer- 'S
ing and to provide for Federal a
interstate highways before Fed
eral funds are spent, marks the
trend of sentiment upon this sub
ject here is indicated in the de- "'
ion bates upon good roads measures
port which have. recently occured in
ary Congress. In the debate upon
nal the Bankhead bill, Senator Geo.
gi- W. Norris, of Nebraska, said:
a "I think the contribution of the
the Federal Government ought not
on to go to all.of the roads in the
vaa country. It ought to be confined
en- to a system of interstate high
es- ways."
re- This idea of restricting the
rth Federal participation in highway
construction to a system of main
ies interstate trunk lines to be locat
ed ed by an expert survey is now
ir- supported by the Representatives
on of many States and many Con
x- gressional districts. The opinion
ln- is growing that in this way such
it federal funds as are devoted to
iss good roads construction will be
-al spent toward a definite object,
d, the highest economic results will
by be realized and the movement
ds will be saved from condemnation
a by the public on the ground that
r-. it is "pork" legislation.
A Symbol of Health.
g- The Pytbagorians of Ancient Greece
aL- ate simple food, practiced temperance
,y and purity. As a badge they used the
n- five pointed star which they regarded
as a symbol of health. A red five point
ed star appears on each package of
3- Chamberlain's Tablets, and still fulfils
its aecient mission as a symbol of
health. If you are troubled with indi
B- gestion, biliousness or constipation,
1- get a package of these tablets from
your druggist. You will be surprised
d at the quick relief which they afford.
