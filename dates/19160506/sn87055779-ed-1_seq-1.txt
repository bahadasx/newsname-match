The erstwhile "czar of the house"
who a ftw brief yea, ago dominated

today as a czar of friendship, senti

noisy outburst of feeling, tears till

gard greeted the aged statesman,
who In the bitter days of 'Cannon

prominent man in public life. With
nearly 4" years of service in the

Speaker Champ Clark made the
non-partis in nature of the occasion
clear as he voiced his recollections
of strenuous days rone by the legis

democrats against "t'nele Joe."
I confess. " he said, 'that s"eir.g

'Tncle Joe" himself held the

his tribute to the past. After com

"If I some times see the face and
hear the voices of others not now
here to answer to the roll call. I
may not be charged with dre.uning,
for among the ,',COO men with
whom I have been a.ssociated in

tests there are hosts of persons,
friends of whom I never thought as
republicans or democrats except as
we discussed different policies. When
I see ghosts in this chamber T am
not frightened for they typify the
spirit of a representative democracy
as truly as do the words and works
of those who laid the foundation of
this government in the beginning."

International News Service:
IX)NDON', May 6. A meeting of
the Irish nationalist party described
as "most important" has been sum
moned for Tuesday. John Redmond
will preside. Conscription and the
situation in reland will be consid
ered. It U understood that the Irish
nationalists are divided over the
amendment to the new military ser
vice bill extending conscription to
Ireland. Some believe that Ireland
should be excluded a.s was the ca.se
with the original conscription meas
ure, whilst others are just as strong
in favor of making the Irish liable
to draft.
With eight of the leaders of the
Sinn Feincrs executed, Iondon was
anxiously awaiting further word
from Dublin where the Irish chiefs
are being tried by a general field
court martial. It is believed, how
ever, that not many more will be
shot.
A mystery has developed in the
case of James M. Sullivan, former
United States minister to Santo Io
mingo, whoso arrest for complicity
In the Irish uprising was announced
at the United States embassy on
Thursday.
Despite a denial that Mr. Sullivan
ig being held by the I'.ritish military
authorities Mrs. Sullivan declares
that her husband has disappeared
and sh hf-s applied to Walter TL
Page, the American ambassador, to
find him. The denial that Mr. Sul
livan was arrested was made by a
member of the government, "but it
was worded so obscurely to give
several different meanings.
The ceneral belief is that Sullivan
is being lvld incommunicado in
London while Scotland yard is in
vestigating his activities In Ireland
where he had been living for some
time.
