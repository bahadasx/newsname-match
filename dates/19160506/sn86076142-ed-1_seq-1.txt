firms sending out ore are highly pleas
ed with the returns that range from
$00 to 80 ton and carload lots of
3,000 and 4,000 are not going to be
an unusual feature of the district as
soon as the preliminary work is com
pleted. From the Sunflower group owned by
Al Hagg and associates one carload
carrying values in silver, copper, lead
and gold has been Bent out and it is
estimated that others will follow at
the rate of a carload a week that, at
the present returns will net the coin-;
pany close to $10,000 a month. The
Sunflower group of four claims was lo
cated last February by A. Hagg and
It being- developed through a shaft

drills at 35 feet and the bottom of

taken. As a matter of fact the ore is
being stuped directly from grass roots
tad the ledge is lively and strong giv
ing every indication of holding out in
definitely. The location is about a
mile Iroui the old General Thomas
which was a rich producer in 1903
and 1904 when one carload brought re
turns of $4,000 even at the low prices
of metal prevailing at that time. The
group la on the east aide of lxnr
Mountain at the south end of th
range, and IS miles from Tonopah.
The first carload was taken from n
five foot ledge and the returns from
the smelter gave the contents as 2f
per cent lead; 6 per cent copper and
20 ounces silver. The formation of the
Sunflower is different from that of any
other property in the district having
diorite for a footwall and lime on tho
hanging wall. The formation lndl

DENVER, May 6. Proposals to re
vert to. the mayoral form of govern
ment in Denver after two years trial
of a commission form of government
will be passed upon by the voters at
a special municipal election on May 9.
The first steps to ffect the change
were taken by the Charter league,
whose petition falls tor the creation of
the office of a mayor "with broad ex
ecutive powers, whose duties to the
city are those of a business manager.
The league says that under its scheme
a saving of half a million dollars an
nually would be effected in the opera
lion of the city government.
Two other petitions have since been
circulated, one proposing a return to
office of former Mayor Robert V.
Spee.r, and the other xeeking the elec
tion of W. W. Booth. Under the pre
sent city charter all municipal elec
tions are non-partisan, but Mr. Speer
Is generally understood to be the
choice of the Democratic organlzatioin
and Mr. Booth to have the support of
the Republicans.
At the special elect loin in February
1914, when the commission form of
government was adopted, the measure
carried hy a majority of 7.849.
