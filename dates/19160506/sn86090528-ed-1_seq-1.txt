dier was killed.
The Mexicans that were involved
in the fight were the remainder of
the fcice that was routed by the Unit
ed States troops on April 22 at Toma
chic. Generals Dominguez, Angeles
and Acosta were in command of then.
Six Carranzista prisoners who w ere
awaiting execution were rescued from
the Villistas and five horses and
mules were taken.
The attack followed a thirty mile
ride of the Americans. The Mexi
cans were resting when the cavalry
launched their attack by firing their
pistols. Furious fighting ensued, last

EAVY FINE
IS IMPOSED
BY MAYOR
W. Solomon is Soaked for $260 on Charge
of Conducting Pawn-Brokerls Busi
ness Without License; Appeal
is Taken by Defendant 1
Mayor Coffman,
judge, yesterday i
upon W. Soioman
acting as police
fternoon imposed
a fine of 2M for
conducting a pawnshop in the city
of Chickasha without license.
Mayor Cofiman stated in assessing
j th! fine that he had found from the
testimony given by the witnesses that
the defendant was conducting a regu
lar pawn-brokerage business, without
license; that he had beeu doing this
for some time; that he had, according
to thy testimony of witnesses, been
guilty of this offense for the past
month of 2ii working days; that the
law allowed him to fine the defend
ant in a sum of from Slfl to $25 for
each offense; that every day the
pawnshop had been conducted by the
defendant wltiiout a license consti
tuted a separate offense and that he
had imposed a fine of $10 for each
offense, making a total of $2:0.
Through his attorneys, Kiddle and
Hammerly, the defendant appealed to
the county court, executing bond In
the sum of $."(H. H. Kohn and Wil
liam Reinheimer signed as bonds
men. Mayor Coffman Mated further that
witnesses had testified that thev hud
when in (lire need of money, been in
th? habit of "rolling" articles to the
defendant with the understanding
thai the article might be redeemed,
or "bought back" within a stipulated
time at an advance of 25 per cent.
"An article," said the mayor, "would
be sold for, say $2, and the person'
'selling' could come back at any time
within 30 days and 'buy back' the ar
ticle sold by paying the defendant
$2.50."
Mr. Coffman said that he felt he
had acted within the bounds of rea
son in assessing the fine of $200, and
that the laws of the city, sanctioned
by the laws of the. state, would have
admitted of his having made the fine
a great deal heavier.
The license for conducting a pawn
brokerage iu Chickasha is JrtO per
year. Mr. Coffman said that this li
cense should be paid by all who ply
tiiat vocation and that others may ex
pect the axe within a short time un

CELEBRATE
BIRTHDAY
OF CANNON
By United Press.
Washington, May 6. Tomorrow
Will be tTncle Joe Cannon's eightieth
birthday. His political friends and
foes iu ;he house of representatives
today commuted the event with an
hour of speech-making filled with bo
nuets and no brickbats.
"Confidentially, 1 wish they would
not have this celebration," the ex
speaker admitted today. "It's too
much like bringing flowers to a
corpse."
"Uncle Joe" is not the extreme par
tisan he was of old. That's, why men
ct all parties in the house feel so
friendly toward him. Since his
'come-back" he has kept out of the
lime-iight.
Uncle Joe still harbors a deep-seated
hatred of political reformers.
Every time ho gets a chance he hits
one on the head.
"I ruppose." said Uncle Joe, "a re
formci has nla place. Sometimes I
think they get pretty thick. They say
their province is to fight with the Al
mighty; that the Almighty and one
are a majority.
"I am not here to abuse them.
Neaily all of them are honest, but
onto in a while one of them is a hypo
crilo." In these days of aeroplanes and
submarines, Uncle Joe is proud he
gave substantial encouragement to
I rof. Langley, the American who was
jeered when he tried to fly in a heav-ier-than-air
machine. He helped him
get an appropriation.
Speaker Clark, Democratic leader
Kitchin, Sherdoon of Ohio, and Gil
lette of Massachusetts were the
speakers. Kodenberg of Illinois wa3
master of ceremonies.

Editor.
(By William G. Shepherd, United,
Press Staff Correspondent.)
Berne, May 5. "All Swiss ow
their country a military service." .
These are tho first words la tbt
Swiss, military rule book.
We haven't any book printed In the
United States, available to tha mass
es, that says any such thing. ' '
These words democratize tho Swiss
army. ,
If the United States were to ta!
fuiced Into war, our regiments wouldj
be commanded. In the main, by the)
young men ot our rich families. Thla
happened in the Spanish-Amerlcani
war.
Political pull, based on wealth and
influence, placed' In tlie bands Of al
most any rich young man who caxet?
to assume the responsibility, the ll?ea
of some hundreds of good average
American citizens. s
This couldn't happen In the Swiss;
army.
When a Swiss soldier goes out td
fight, he knows he is under a trained
officer, selected bjr experts and tried.
Just being rich, doesn't get you any
where in the Swiss army. Being rich
doesn't keep jou out of the army,
either. It isn't any training of the
Plattsburg camp variety that takes
you to the top in the Swiss army. It's
brains and ability. The Swiss rule
is that everybody must start In tha
ranks.
As a man shows special adaptabil
ity he is FORCED to taka special ex
aminations for promotion. Ha can
not refuse a promotion.
The examinations are rigid; tha
kind social! pull can't overcome. Tha
result is that, whether a youth comes
from the poorest or the richest, ha
must be whatever his ability makes
him.
The rich man's son may remain a
private all his life while the son ot
the poorest man in the neighborhood
may be his military superior.
Only a democratic army like this,
military men In Europe say, Is safe
and strong. There is rottenness and
fatal weakness in an army where so
cial position and wealth avail.
In Chiasso, Switzerland, I saw the
clerk in Luigi Corti's grocery store
step out on the sidewalk In his ser
geant's uniform, just as the son of the
village banker went by in his auto
mobile. The banker's son sainted
Luigi's clerk, because the clerk's uni
form indicated that Luigi's clerk was
a better man. as a soldier, than tho
banker's son.
And any country that does want to
keep alive and whole must have- plen
ty of citizens who can become full
fledged soldiers at a moment's no
tice. Looking over the armies of Europe,
which I have seen, I am led to believe
that the American military system la
the worst of them all.
It's a dangerous system, with lead
ership based on many other things
than ability.
It Is permeated with politics. From
this distance and this r'ace. it looks
I like a papier mache revolver that will
make the other fellow shoot, but that
can't be shot itself.
It Isn't the fault of our Btanding
army or of our army men. It's tho
fault of the American citizen, who
ooesnt realize that he Isn't tha
straightest shooting, finest muscled.
