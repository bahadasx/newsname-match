'"Ihe Ballet Girl," a heart drama
of peculiar appeal in which two such
noted stars as Alice Brady and Ilol
brook Blinn are featured, comes to
the Gem Theatre on Sunday, herald
ed by the warmest praise from the
critics of New York, who declare it
to be in every respect the most power
ful drama yet penned by the inter
nationally famed author, Compton
MacKenzie. In addiiition to this fact,
"The Ballet Girl" possesses partic
ular interest because it presents for
the first time stage life as it really is.
Nothing is glossed over.
"The smell of grease paint," the
atmosphere of the stage--that mys
terious and fascinating region---is re
produced with absolute fidelity to
truth. The director of "The Ballet
Girl" spent weeks absorbing every bit
of theatrical atmosphere he could in
order that there might be no weak
points about his production.
"The Ballet Girl" tells the en
thrnlling story of a young girl's life
upon the stage, and how she success
fully evades the snares and pitfall:;
of New York's night life that con
stantly beset her.
It unfolds the story of a struggle
to the topmost rung of the stage
ladder, with the Critics and the public
at the feet of the famous danseuse.
the butterfly into which the chrysalis
of the little country girl develops.
The real stages and dressing rooms
of famous theatres were used in mak
ing the scenes of "The Ballet Girl,"
with the result that it far exceeds it
absorbing realism most photodramas
dealing with stage life, the producer-:
of which content themselves with
"studio sets," which invariably fail
of their effect.
Miss Brady's character in "The Ba!
let Girl" is one to which her genius
perfectly adapts itself. She is in
turn coquettish, pathetic and dra
matic, rising to great heights of pas
sion and power in the scenes inw
which the soul of "The Ballet Gir!"
is tried on the anvil of stage life.
Be.ides the theatrical side of life por
trayed in "The Ballet Girl," "
duetio
machinations of the rich and power
ful.
Miss Brady's support in this note
worthy feature consists in part of
fifty of the most beautiful girls of
the Metropolitan ballet, selected for
grace of limb and beauty of face by
a committee of artists and motion
picture directors. The dancers are
seen in beautifully staged scenes,
showing celebrated bits from well
known operatic ballets.
The production is on a scale of I
lavishness throughout that furnishes
a proper environment for the two
eminent stars who head the long list
of players.
Helen Ware in "The Price."
"The Price." in which Helen Ware,
the noted emotional star, plays the
role she created in the legitimate pro
duction, comes to the Gem Monday.
The story, adapted from the play by
George Broadhurst, follows in brief:
A young girl, reared in lux
ury, is thrown penniless upon
her own resources. She becomes
secretary to a great artist, who,
in younger and p o o r e r days,
married his landlady's daughter. In
need of inspiration, the artist turns
to his charming secretary. Believing
that she loves him, the girl submits,
but finds her mistake when, meeting
a flourishing physician, she learns
true love. Both the physician and
the artist want to marry the girl, the
latter promising to get rid of his pres
ent encumbrance. Feaiing the phy
sician will learn of her past, the girl
refuses his offer of marriage.
The artist, having a weak heart,
drops dead at her feet upon learning
that she does not love him, where
upon the girl becomes the phy:ician's
bride.
The artist's widow, seeking v\n -
gence, after much discuio:;' be-
tween the physici:n ani ,ia wlie, se
cures the position of hou~iekeepevi in
their home and plants seei of je:l
ousy within the wife by tc!i;M" he'
the physician loves his adopted -child,
whom lie had brought up nromn in
fancy. The wife flies into a rage,
charging her husband with infileli'y,
whereupon the widow, making' 1.e r
revenge complete, reads a diary. f"oo'
ishly kept by the artist, telling of his
relations with his former secretary,
to husband and wife. In her freni
zied protestations, the wife also re
veals the fact that it was her re
jection of his love that caused the
death of the artist.
Attempting suicide. the wife is pre
vented by her maid. who shows her
the folly of such an act. The wife,
impressed by the recilal, decides to
live down the past and try to win
hack her husband's love.
A Symbol of Health.
T'he Pythagorians of ancient
Greece ate simple food, practiced
temperance and purity. As a badge
they used the live-pointed star which
they regarded as a symbol of health.,
A red five-pointed star appears on
each package of Chamberlain's Tab
lets, and still fullils its ancient mis
sion as a symbol of health. If you
are troubled with indigestion, bilious
ness or constipation, get a package of
these tablets from your druggist.
You will be surprised at the quick re
lief which they afford. Obtainable

VOTES FOR WOMEN.
Southern States Woman Suffrage
Conference.
417 Camp Street, New Orleans.
How California Women Vote.
The record of the laws that Cali
fo "nia women have brought about is
a splendid exhibit of the kind of
legislature that enlists the women's
vote. Here are a few which Judge
W. :P, awlor- and Francis 3: Heney
Women- have been successful in
raising the age of consent from six
teen to eighteen; securing juvenile
court amendment separating depend
ent from delinquent children; requir
ing fathers to support illegitimate
children; requiring certificate of
health from men as a precedent to
the marriage license; minimum wage
law; workingmen's compensation law;
mothers' pension law; teachers' pen
sion law; granting a pension of $500
a year to teachers who have been in
service thirty years; joint guardian
ship law; requirement of a wife's
signature to< the assignment of a
husband's wages; a prison reform
bill; raising the age of child-workers
from twelve to fifteen; a billboard
nuisance act and an amendment to
the liquor law, hitting particularly
at San Francisco's all-night sale; the
red-light abatement law, placing the
responsibility of illegal resorts upon
owners and lessees, rather than on
the inmates, and forbidding such
places.
Woman Suffrage at St. Louis.
Every Democratic national com
mitteeman and delegate will be asked
to work for a states rights woman
suffrage plank in the St. Louis con
vention. Sure it's good democracy to
give the vote to women. Women are
people and how can we have a gov
ernment by the people when one-half
the people are not permitted to vote?
Wouldn't it sound queer for a Fourth
of July orator to shout, "We believe
in a government of one-half the peo
ple for one-half the people, by one
half the people!" But that's just the
kind of a democracy we have in all
except twelve states.'
A Slander Squelched.
The opponents of woman suffrage
industriously endeavored to prove that
Chicago women have not been bene
fited by the vote. One of the slan
ders was to the effect that the com
missioner of public welfare had mis
used her authority. The investiga
tion ordered by the mayor of Chicago
was conducted by the Civil Service
Commission, which returned a ver
dict of "Not Guilty." Anti-suf
fragists must look elsewhere for
means whereby to attack "votes for
women."
The Registered Nurses Association
of Savannah, Georgia, endorsed a
iesolution for woman suffrage.
Mary Pickford, the movie idol, is
a suffragist.

PROGRESS IN PICTURES.
Demand for Better Productions Met
by American Enterprise,
The rapid growth of the business
of producing motion pictures has
brought forward new groups of
picture makers to succeed the older
companies, and because of the su
periority of their productions they
have risen to a high plane ahnost
within a few months, A notable in
stance is the Metro Pictures Corpo
ration, whose progress in twelve
months has placed it at the very top
as a producer of great photodramas.
The Metro group includes four
great producing companies, namely,
Columbia, Rolfe Photoplays Inc.,
Popular Plays and Players, and the
Quality Pictures Corporation. The
Metro distributes the entire picture
product of these companies and their
star list includes such notable play
ers as Francis X. Bushman, Mme.
Petrova, Beverly Bayne, Ethel Barry
more, Mr. and Mrs. Sidney Drew,
Harold Lockwood, May Allison, Mar
guerite Snow, Emily Stevens. Viola
Dana, Mary Miles Minter, Edmund
Breese, Hamilton Revelle, Mabel Tal
iaferro and other distinguished ar
tists.
President Richard A. Rowland, the
leader of the Metro group, anticipat
ed the demand for newer, bigger, bet
ter productions, and as a result Me
tro wonderplays have achieved great
popularity among the better class of
motion picture patrons. It is Me
tro's policy never to send out a pic
ture that does not pass four tests.
These requirements are good, power
ful and entertaining stories, real ac
tion and direction, fine photography,
and satisfatr acting from tetar
known as f eaturesand In addition re
leases the now famous Metro-Drew
comedies. The Metro studios, of
which there are six, are located in
New York, in Los Angeleys and in
Jacksonville, Fla. A weekly publica
tion, the Picture Magazine, is de
voted entirely to stories about Metro
plays and players and its circulation
has grown to a million a week.
Metro's success in the art of mo
tion pictures is an example of Amer
ican enterprise. Just a year old, its
pictures are shown in all the countries
of the world, and its progress is a tri
bute to American brains, artistry and
energy.
BONDS FOR GOOD ROADS.
$28,000,000 For Jefferson Highway
and All-State System.
The Louisiana Good Roads Associ
ation, of which P. M. Milner is presi
dent, will go before the state legis
lature at the coming session, to urge
a bond issue of $3,000,000 for the
construction of that part of the Jef
ferson Highway extending from
Shreveport to New Orleans. Plans
looking to the accomplishment of this
project were made known at a meet-.
ing of the highway committee of the
New Orleans Association of Com
Lmerce, when a stirring talk was made
by J. D. Clarkson, general manager
of the Jefferson Highway Association.
State Highway Engineer Atchison 1
presented a blue print showing a
complete hard road system traversing
the entire state, including the Jeffer
son Highway, and announced that he
is going to make a fight before the
general assembly for a $25,000,000
bond issue for good roads. Mr. Mil
ner assured the engineer he would
receive the assistance of all good
roads enthusiasts.
Mr. Atchison said plans of the vari
ous parishes along the route of the
Jefferson Highway, between Shreve
port and New Orleans, gave assur
ance that the highway will be com
plete in a maximum time of three
years.
The general committee adopted a
resolution pledging itself to arouse
all possible interest in the immediate
organization of a Louisiana associa
tion of the Jefferson Highway Asso
ciation. The highway will connect
Winnipeg, Canada, and New Orleans.

Work already has been commenced
on the Jefferson Highway, connecting
New Orleans, with the Dominion of
Canada. Plans have been prepared
for the Southern National Highway,
coming down the Atlantic coast line
from Washington, D. C., and skirting
the Gulf coast sections of Mississippi
and Louisiana, on through Texas to
the Pacific coast. This will prove a
valuable adjunct to the Lincoln Na

of the United States.
The Mississippi Highway will ex
tend from Duluth, Minn., to the Gulf
of Mexico, running through Wiscofi

The Jefferson Davis Memorial High
way, following the route of the old

STATE-WIDE DIPPING LAW.
Mississippi Takes Important Step in
Tick Eradication Campaign.
The new Miss1sippi law requiring
each county in the state that is still
infested with cattle ticks to begin
systematic eradication work next year
is the first measure of the kind in the
history of the campaign for the total
elimination of the pest in the south.
Hitherto, tick eradication has been a
matter of county option. Each coun
ty has determined for itself whether
or not it should undertake the work.
In Mississippi after January 1, 1917,
there will be no choice. After that
date the law provides that the cattle
in every .county which has not al
ready freed itself of the tick must
be dipped regularly in accordance
with the roles and regulations of the
State Live Stock Sanitary Board un
til, in the words of the act, "the cat
tle tick be permanently eradicated and
destroyed." As experience has shown
that energetic work can usually ac
complish this result in one season,
this means that the entire state of
Mississippi should be out of quaran
tine by the end of 1917, or at the
latest by the end of 1918.
This radical departure from the old
policy of allowing each county to put
up with the tick or drive it out, as it
chose, has been necessitated by the
progress that has already been made.
Since tick eradication began in Mis
sissippi in 1908, forty counties out
of a total of eighty-one have been
freed from quarantine and twelve
other counties are now engaged in
systematic work. Some of the other
counties, however, have steadily re
fused to take any part in the cam
paign and in certain instances now
present a serious menace to the live
stock industry in adjacent tick-free
territory.
As is well known ticks are the only
means of spreading splenetic fever.
In most cases the eradication of- the
tick has been accompanied by the im
portation of valuable pure-bred stock,
and cattlemen in these areas are de
termined to be rid of the danger of
reinfection. Moreover, the existence
in the midst of tick-free territory of
isolated ticky counties interferes with
the movement of stock and hampers
in a number of ways the full realiza
tion of the benefits of eradication.
Under the new law the state-wide
campaign of elimination will not be
na until Jan. 1, 1917. The inter
vening time it is planned to utilize in
the, construction of dipping vats in
those counties which have not yet
done any systematic work. As a mat
ter of fact, there are some dipping
vats in every county now which are
being used by individual farmers to
free their own herds, but in most
cases the number .is nsot sufdeient for

appropriate money for the salaries of
the assistants and make the other ar
rangements for the coming year. ir
each county the work is to be under
the charge of an inspector appointed
by the State Live Stock Sanitary
Board and paid by it. For failure on
the part of cattle owners to comply
with the regulations of the board in
regard to dipping, a penalty of fine
or imprisonment, or both, is pro
vided by the law.
The law also directs the board to
co-operate with the federalofficials in
the work of tick eradication. In or
der to make this co-operation more
effective, the, board recently decided
to put the state's part in tick eradica
tion in Mississippi in charge of a
special inspector who is to give his
entire time to the work.
Enough has been done already in
Mississippi to demonstrate both the
practicability and the benefit of tick
eradication. In those counties which
have taken up the work, death from
splenetic fever is practically unknown
and the quality of the cattle has been
greatly improved by the introduction
of hundreds of pure-bred bulls. The
grand champion Hereford bull is a
Mississippi product and many of his
progeny are owned in the state. The
effect of this grading up of the herds
is shown in the success of the new
baby beef clubs organized throughout
the state, in the increase in tihe num
ber of creameries and silos, and in
the improvement in the pastures.
Good stock repays good care, but
good steck and the tick do not go to
gether.
Work Progressing on New Packet.
Captain M. F. Bradford, president
of the Bradford Transportation Com
pany, who was called back from Jef
fersonville on account of the illness
of one of his sons, Willie, was happy
to find the latter's condition improv

but he will not return to Jefferson
ville until the young man is on the
road to recovery. Captain Bradford
reports that the Howards have been
busy during the past week cutting
out the timber for the frame of his
company's new Bayou Teche and up

The hull of the boat, he says, will be
constructed of selected Virginia white
oak, and Captain Howard has promis

sent to southern waters in some years.
She will be supplied with two Fowler
& Wolf boilers, allowed 200 pounds
