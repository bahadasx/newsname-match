SIMPLE LIFE BEST
Wear and Tear Cause Statesmen
to Die Young.
SAYS WORK ISN'T TO BLAME.
Yale Professor, After an Exhaustive
Study on Question of Vitality of Our
Publio Men, Declares Quiet Life Is
the Long One.
New Haven, Conn.That the simple
life Is the long one and that the con
vivial social 4ife~of the nation's rep
resentatives In congress Is not condu
cive to longevity, but has, on the con
trary, been the means of taking off at
a too early age many of the best men
of the country, are deductions made by
Professor Irving Fisher, one of the
best known political economists in the
country, after an exhaustive study.
"Presidents, vice presidents and con
gressmen are a select group, endowed
at the outset with unusual vitality.
The vitality of most of them is severe
ly taxed and materially reduced by the
heavy responsibilities and bad person
al hygiene incident to a public career.
A minority escape the worst of these
conditions and retain the major part of
their natural endowment of vitality.
Bad hygiene has been more destruc
tive than the weight of responsibility.
"This conclusion is suggested by the
fact that the vice presidents suffer a
greater curtailment of life Juan the

PROFESSOR IBVHTO FISHES.
presidents, although vice presidents
have far less responsibility, but spend
much more time in Washington social
life than the presidents. It is also sug
gested by the fact that the civil war
period, with its greater weight of re
sponsibility but more simple living,
showed a lower mortality than the pe
riods preceding and following, with
less weight of responsibility but less
simple living."
Professor Fisher said that historically
there has been a progressive decrease
in those causes of death consisting of
infections which kill their victims
chiefly at the earlier ages, but a pro
gressive change for the worse In those
causes of death consisting of the wear
and tear diseases or degenerative dis
eases which kill their victims chiefly at
the later years.
"These opposite changes," Professor
Fisher says, "in the infectious and de
generative diseases would explain the
improvement in mortality at the earlier
ages and, on the other hand, the non
improvement and, in the case of Yale
graduates, even positive retrogression
in the mortality of the older ages.
Again, they would explain the marked
exceptionality of the older ages in the
civil war period. For if it was plain
living which explained the low mor
tality of that period we should expect
-the more marked Influence of that fac
tor to appear just as it does, at the
older ages at which the wear and tear
mortality is chiefly registered.
"The damage to vitality which we
find in public life is not, therefore, put
forward as an argument against enter
ing public service, nor will a knowl
edge of the facts probably tend In that
direction, certainly not among those
who place public Interests above per
sonal interests, as every public man
should. But knowledge is power, and
a knowledge of the facts should enable
us to protect "our public men or enable
them to protect themselves and to do
so in the public interest This can be
accomplished by better general health
conditions in the country and Its cap
ital, by better health customs and hab
its, by better ideals and by a more sys
tematic application of the perfect ideals
already existing."
In connection with the lives of the
presidents of the United States, Pro
fessor Fisher says:
"The longevity of each president is
reckoned from the date of inaugura
tionthat is, from the time of his first
being president Thus Washington be
came president at the age of fifty
seven, when the 'expectation' of life,
according to the American experience
table, was sixteen years. He actually
lived, however, only eleven years In
stead of the sixteen. John Adams, on
the other hand, lived after inaugura
tion twenty-nine years, which was two
and three times his expectation of thir
teen years." ,4,

PRAYER
Healing of Seventy-year-old Pennsyl
vania Man-Regarded as a Miracle.
Greensburg, Pa.Walter McCluckle,
seventy, for sixteen years a helpless
invalid, is able to walk again, and his
recovery Is declared to be a direct an
swer to prayer.
He is a member of the Youngwood
United Brethren church. Recently a
series of cottage prayer meetings was
held, and at Mr. McCluckle's sugges
tion It was arranged to pray for his
healing. The Rev. John Watson, pas
tor of the church, with twenty-five
members, went to his home. Mr. Wat
son read from the third chapter of
Acts, where It is recorded that Peter
and John caused the lame man to
walk, and from the fifth chapter of
James, which declares, "The prayer of
faith shall save the sick." The minis
ter and others followed with prayers
for Mr. McCluckle's recovery.
The prayers finished, Mr. Watson
said, "Let us rise and sing 'Praise God
From Whom All Blessings Flow.'"
To the astonishment of all, Mr. Mc
Cluckle rose with the others, joined in
the singing and then walked about the
room. His recovery is regarded as a
miracle.
$50 FOR SEVEN WINKS.
Following a Custom of Greece Looked
Like Mashing Out In Missouri.
Kansas City, Mo.George Stamatois.
twenty-six years old, 510 Main street,
has not forgotten the customs of his
native Greece. There it seems to be
the fashion to wink at any woman you
want to become acquainted with. The
Greek custom brought Stamatois to
grief In staid Kansas City.
Stamatois entered a department store
the other afternoon. He winked at
six pretty girls to no avail. He wink
ed at a seventh, who promptly seized
him by the arm, showed him store
detective's star and escorted him to a
crossing patrolman.
Stamatois answered a charge of
"mashing" before Justice Charles
Clark, acting judge, in the north side
court here soon after.
"That winking trick's a favorite over
in Greece, judge," Stamatois said.
"That's the way we meet all our nice
women. I thought it was all right
here too. I've got to show my appreci
ation of the girls some way."
"That's a poor way," Judge Clark
answered. "The wink is not favored
In Kansas City. You're fined $50." I
WITH DONKEY AND DOG
WALKS 3,400 MILES
Price Wins a Wager by a Long
Tramp.
Victoria, B. Edward P. Price does
not wear medals in recognition of a
world's record tramp, neither is he the
author of any "Travels by Foot" tales
not yetbut he has made something
of a record for stamina and is now
hopelessly a victim to a relentless de
sire to walk every highway which may
be casually named in his presence. He
has walked from Chicago to San Fran
cisco in a roundabout way, a distance
of 3,400 miles. He does not claim that
there is anything remarkable about
that fact alone, but the circumstances
of the trip make a good story.
The first consideration is the fact
that Mr. Price at the beginning of his
tramp was a tenderfoot
The Price party, for he did not trav
el alone, was essentially a tenderfoot
group. Perhaps the most experienced
member was Bunny, a donkey whose
eight years had at least taught him
caution. Another member was a collie
dog named Prince, which is now much
more than mere dog to Mr. Price, and
another thing which does not appear
in the log of the journey, but upon
which he admits the successful con
clusion of the undertaking largely de
pended, was the taunts of Price's
friends in Chicago.
Price left Chicago in midsummer,
1914, traveling westward along the
Lincoln highway. The tramp was the
result of a wager and was to be made
entirely on foot with the consideration
that the conditions would not be ful
filled unless the journey was finished
with both of his four footed compan
ions. He insists without a blush that
every inch of the journey was on foot
The certified statements of the may
ors of the various cities along the
route form the credentials.
Starting without money, the commis
sariat was provided entirely by a gun
and fishing tackle and the proceeds
from singing at the show houses along
the way. The camp equipment, in
cluding provisions, amounted to 100
pounds, and this was Bunny's burden.
Hid Over $7,000 In Hut.
Cedar Falls, la.More than $7,000
was found hidden in the hut of George
Pound, eight miles north of here, when
the administrator of his estate made
an investigation. Pound died sudden
ly and was supposed to have left little
money. Twenty years ago he lost
more than $5,000 in a bank failure and
thereafter never trusted banks.
Gets a Civil War Letter.
Bangor. Cal.L. E. Cole of this town
received a letter recently written to
him by bis brother on Dec. 2,1864. At
that time the writer was a soldier in
the Union army, and he tells of the
chase into Mississippi after General
Price's command. Where the letter has
been for the past half century is a
mystery.

INVALID, CONVICTS TO PUNT COTTON.
They Will Cultivate 1,300 Acres of a
Prison Farm.
McAlester, Okla.Thirteen hundred
acres of the state prison farm will be
planted- to cotton this year. All work
except the overseeing of the labor will
be done by prisoners.
The land on which this cotton will be
produced was a few yeara ago merely
rocky and a waste. Hills rock covered
and eroded by rains and gullies deeply
cut by spring floods surrounded the
concrete walls of the penitentiary.
Hard labor and careful management
have changed the surface to a rolling,
well drained seed bed.
Rocks were removed from the sur-
faee.~ Gullies- -were filled up after
drains had been laid. Dams and riprap
were emplaced to hold back the fine
soil carried down by showers.
In the coming year almost the entire
acreage will be devoted to cotton. Of
the land still rocky and unimproved
hog and cattle pastures have been
made. Bermuda grass is spreading,
and before many years at the present
rate of development enough beef and
dairy supplies will be produced to feed
the convicts.
KEEPS MAN'S AUTO.
Farmer Who Hires Hand Will Pay For
Car, Also For Gasoline.
Danville, 111.-A contract has been
signed between Patrick Green, a farm
er of Grant township, and Milt Brady
in which Green agrees to pay Brady
$30 a month for his services as a farm
workman and to pay, in addition, for
the upkeep of the latter's automobile.
Green is to provide gasoline and oil
for the machine throughout the sea
son.
It has been the custom for the farm
ers of this vicinity to provide a horse
and buggy for an employee when need
ed or to permit the employee to keep a
horse and buggy on the farm, the
farmer supplying the feed for the
horse. This is the first instance, how
ever, that has come to light of a farm
er's paying for the upkeep of an em
ployee's automobile.
OLD MAN GREAT HUNTER.
Whisner, at Eighty, Has Killed 330
Deer and 500 Coons.
Berkeley Springs, W. Va.Peter V.
B. Whisner, who is eighty years old, is
the champion hunter of West Virginia.
During a period covering fifty years
he has killed 330 deer, about 500 coons
and 500 turkeys, besides, many foxes,
squirrels and other game. Of the 330
deer fifty were bucks having horns
with from three to five prongs. Two of
the deer were white, rare specimens,
and one black. The greatest number
he killed In one season was thirty-five.
Practically all his hunting was done
with a muzzle loading rifle. He said if
he had had a rifle like those In use now
he could have killed several hundred
more deer. He says he has seen four
teen deer In one drove, one of which
had white legs, the white extending up
to its body.
FREED CONVICTS ARE FLUSH.
Fifteen Men Out of Prison Had $2304

Olympla, Wash.Instead of the usual
prison gift of $5 each, fifteen inmates
of the state penitentiary at Walla Wal

cash varying from $60 to $80 and the
lowest $15.80, all earned at the rate of
50 cents a day and board on public
road work in Douglas county.
Another detachment of thirty men
has been ordered from the prison to the

"Malaria experts of the United States

"A hole In the bottom of the empty

HOTEL FOR] GIRLS.
I
Home Bequeathed to Workers by
New York Merchant.
EXPERIENCE SHOWED NEED.
Suggests That Hotel For Unmarried
Working Women Be Ereoted In
Business District, but Does Not Con
fine Executors to Any One Region.
New York.Charles Bertram Web
ster, a merchant who died March 16
last, bequeathed about one-third of his
large estate fbr the foundation of a
corporation which is directed to erect
in the retail dry goods district an
apartment house wherein unmarried
working women shall have apartments
at cost
The decedent, who for many years
lived at the Hotel Netherland, was a
native of Providence, R. I., a son of
Josiah L. Webster, a dry goods mer
chant there. He came
!to New York
early in life. In 1896 he retired from
active business, but never lost his.in
terest in it or in the people who work
ed for the firm. I
Before providing for| the project
which had long been in his mind, Mr.
Webster bequeathed to" five cousins
$5,000 each, set aside $25,000 to Thom
as W. Beckley, described as a "serv-
ant," and gave $10,000 to his coach
man, Frank Falkner.
He bequeathed to Joseph L. Web
ster, his brother, all his horses, car
riages, harness, clothing, jewelry and
automobiles and two-thirds of his re
siduary estate. He then said:
'""Having been engaged for man.v
years in the business kn|wn as a de
partment store in the cltyfof New York
and having employed,a large number
of unmarried women in ifbat business.
I have realized that the domestic envi
ronments of many of them are not con
ducive to their morals orpiealth, and I
have concluded to endeavor to Improve
the condition of some of $hem by giv
ing them the opportunity to live in
clean, well ventilated, comfortable and
attractive apartments, and for that
purpose I direct my executors to form,
or cause to be formed, as soon as prac
ticable after my death a corporation for
benevolent purposes under the mem
bership corporation law of the state of
New York or under such pther law of
the state of New York afc may be ap
plicable at the time. v.--~*r-'
"The particular objects for which
such corporation is to be formed are to
generally improve the conditions of un
married working women and particu
larly to establish, maintain and con
duct apartments in the borough of i
Manhattan for occupation by unmar
rled working women regardless of their I
religious belief or nationality and
wherein they may find comfortable and i
attractive homes. I
"The name of said corporation shall
be the Webster apartments, anoTthe
territory In which the corporation shall
be principally conducted shall be the
borough of Manhattan."
The decedent suggests that the build
ing be erected in the vicinity of the re
tail stores, but does not confine the ex
ecutors to any particular district. He
says he thinks the sort of building he
desires can be erected and equipped for
about $400,000, but he does not confine
his agents to this sum. They can spend
more if they think necessary.
"The building shall contain a library
and restaurant," directs the decedent,
"and such other appurtenances as will
tend to render the apartments com
fortable and attractive. Apartments
are to be let furnished and unfurnished.
"I direct that said apartments shall
not be conducted for profit, but solely
for the purpose of providing unmarried
working women with homes and whole
some food at a small cost to them and
in deserving cases without cost to them.
I direct that the directors of said cor
poration shall fix the rentals and the
prices of food with the view of carry
ing out that purpose. The cost of main
taining the apartment and restaurant
in excess of the receipts therefrom shall
be met from such income as the corpo
ration may have exclusive of the re
ceipts from said restaurant and rent-
als."
"The decedent asks the executors to
serve as officers of the corporation until
the first annual meeting.

WESTERN BLIND COUPLE
EASILY RUN BIG FARM
They Are Musicians and at One
Time Traveled All Over
the Country.
Jet, Okla. Despite the fact that
both are totally blind, Mr. and Mrs.
Harry A. Hubbard successfully op
erate the farming part of a half sec
tion of land they own just west of Jet,
in Alfalfa county. Both are retired
musicians and expect to spend the rest
of their days on the farm enjoying life.
They have traveled extensively all
over the United States giving concerts,
but three years ago settled down to
the rural life near here.
Mrs. Hubbard was blind at birth,
and her husband was made so previ
ous to their marriage. Curiously
enough, they use different systems of
reading, and each reads a great deal,
especially the books that are sent to
them on the "round robin" plan- from
the blind schools. Mrs. Hubbard is
an adept at reading by the raised let
ter system. Her husband uses a more
modern way of reading and one con
sidered by those who know it to be
faster than the raised letter system.
It is a series of holes cut in the paper
at intervals. They are located, from
one to six, both above and below a
standard line, designating a character.
Reading occupies a great part of their
time when they are not at work doing
one of the many chores about the
farm.
To the casual observer the farm is
no different from the usual well ar
ranged farm in the community. It
is a noticeable fact that all of the ma
chinery and implements used are kept
in sheds and out of the way.
Time was when these two people
were on the road all the time. Blind
musicians with the ability they are
able to show are In demand in the
musical circles of the country, and
they found no trouble in getting all of
the engagements they could fill. Play
ing practically every instrument made,
the two of them composed an orches
tra, one of their program numbers be
ing a duet in which seven instruments
were played at the same time.

Jacklin was left penniless when his
parents died, but he worked his way
through the Warrensburg Normal
school and the Rolla School of Mines.
He then went west and as a mining en

His earnings run into the thousands
yearly, and he receives large dividends
from eighteen mining corporations in
which he is a stockholder. He wants

was practicable. "I believe that I

That Mrs. English has been com

shown in the attitude of Thomas Dunn

June evening In time of peace a queer
sensation is produced. The percussive
crack heard by thousands of air men
above the European battle lines these
days and nights In all kinds of weather
produces a sensation much more queer.

BOELKE AND FEOOXTD.
men can testify that an experience of
the sort is a thing of Imperishable
vividness.
Cowdin and Thaw, among numerous
Americans who have joined the fight
ing air men, can tell many such tales.
Boelke, Immelmann, Guynemer, Bone,
among the newcomers, and Vedrines,
Beaumont and Garros, to mention a
few of the veterans, are making Inef
faceable records. These men use the
aeroplane, or avion, as they call It not
merely as a scouting vehicle, but as a
deadly instrument of offense.
Lieutenant Boelke of the German
army recently brought down his thir
teenth machine over the Forges forest
Lieutenant Baron von Althaus brought
down his fourth aeroplane over enemy
lines west of Iihons. The element of
sport enters even Into aeroplane war
fare. After all, thinks the aviator, the
shame is not so much in being caught
as being caught by a mere amateur
with a paltry record of two or three
captures to his name.
Lieutenant Immelmann recently bag
ged his tenth enemy aeroplane. The
gallantry and bravery of lieutenant'
Warneford illustrates the spirit of
these European aviators. Single hand
ed he attacked a Zeppelin and destroy
ed it. A few days later, accompanied
by the American writer Needham, he
made a pleasure trip, and both men
were killed in landing.
On intimate terms with death were
those fifty air men who fought the
greatest aerial battle of the war re
cently when the allied aeroplanes raid
ed Mulhausen, Upper Alsace. Five Ger
man aeroplanes and three French fell,
the occupants of all being killed.
On the outbreak of the war Adolphe
Pegoud, the famous French aviator
who gained renown In 1913 when he
originated the feat of flying upside

loop, Joined the French squadron and
was often mentioned for valor. He
startled the American people when he
came to this country and did the loop

down in aeronautic history.
Wild Beasts Kill Deer.
Eugene, Ore.The snowfall has re
sulted in a great slaughter of deer by
predatory animals, In the opinion of C.
J. Hills of Oakridge. He tells of find
ing- several carcasses, one indicating
that the deer had been killed by a
wildcat At this point the snow was
twenty feet deep, and the deer had
been, there apparently several days in
a space ten feet square. It had eaten
a bunch of mapje bushes for food. As
