Berlin, May 5 (by wireless via Say- l
ville, N. Y.). Following in the text
of the note of the German government
in reply to (he American note re
specting submarine warfare, delivered
on Thursday by Gottlieb von Jagow,
the foreign secretary, to Ambassador
Gerard: ' - . .
: Text of Note
"The undersigned, on behalf of the
imperial German government, has the
honor to -present to hie excellency the
ambassador of the United States,
James W. Gerard, the following reply
to the note of April 20 regarding the
conduct of German submarine war
fare: Doubtful About Sussex :
"Tie German government handed
over to the proper naval authorities
tor early Investigation the evidence
concerning the Sussex as communicat
ed by the government of the United
States. Judging by the results that
he investigation has hitherto yielded,
the German government is alive-to the
possibility that the ship, mentioned in
the note of April .10 as having loeen
torpedoed by a- German submarine is
actually identical with the Sussex. -
.Asks Suspension of Judgment.
"The German government begg to
reserve further communication on the
matter until certain points are ascer
tained, which are of decisive impor
tance for establishing the facts of the
case. Should it turnout that the com
mander was wrong in assuming the
vessel ito be a man of war, the German 1
government will not fall to draw the
consequences' resulting therefrom.
Denial of Indiscriminate Destruction.
"In connection with the case of the
Sussex the government of the United
States made a series of statements, the
gist of which Is the assertion that the
'ncldent is to be considered but one
instance of a deliberate method of in
discriminate destruction of vessels of
all sorts, nationalities and destinations
by German submarine commanders.
"The German government must em
phatically repudiate the assertion. The
German government, however, thinks
.'t of little avail to enter into details in
the present stage of affairs, more par
ticularly as the government of the
United States omitted to substantiate
the assertion by reference to concrete
facta. . .
Has Restrained Submarines
"The German government will only
state that it has imposed far-reaching
restraints upon the use of the subma
rine weapon, solely in consideration of
neutrals interests In spite of the fact
that these restrictions are necessarily
of advantage to Germany's enemies.
No such consideration has ever "been
shown neutrals by Great Britain and
her allies.
Instructions to Commanders
"The German submarine forces have
had, in fact, orders to conduct the
submarine warfare In accordance with
the general principles of visit and
search nd the destruction of merchant
vessels recognized by international
law, the sole exception being the con
duct of warfare against enemy trade
carried on enemy freight ships encoun
tered in the war zone surrounding
Great Britain. .With regard to these,
no assurances have ever, been given to
the government of the United States.
Mo such assurances are contained in
the declaration of Feb. 3, 1916. ,
Allowances Must bo Made
"The German government cannot
admit any doubt that these orders
were given or are executed in good
faith. Errors actually occurred. They
can in no kind of warfare be avoided
altogether. Allowances must be made
in the conduct of naval warfare against
an enemy . resorting to all Kinds o.
Unavoidable Dangers fop Neutrals
ruses, whether permissible f : Illicit.
"But apart from the possibility of
errors, naval warfare, lust like warfare
on land, implies unavoidable dangers
for neutral persons and goods entering
the fighting sons. Even in cases where
the naval action Is confined to ordinary
forma of cruiser warfare, neutral per'
eons and goods .' repeatedly come to
grief. ,
Has Repeatedly Pointed Out Danger
"The German government has re
peatedly and explicitly pointed out the
danger from mines that have led to the
loss of numerous ships.
Has Mads Several Proposals
"The German government has made
several proposals to the government
of the United States In order to reduce
to a minimum for American travelers
and goods the inherent dangers of
naval warfare. Unfortunately, the rov-
" ernment of the United Sttates decided
not to accept the proposals. Had it
accepted, the government of the United
States would have been instrumental
in preventing the greater pant of the
' accidents that American citizens iave
met with In the meantime.
'The German government still stands
by its offer to come to an agreement
along these nnes.

MEASURE FOR BRITAIN
America Has Discriminated
Sacred Principles of Humanity
the conduct of warfare against enemy
trade. The German government, how
ever, has now decided to make a fur
ther concession, adapting methods of
submarine war to the Interests or neu
trals. ;
"in reaching Re decision the German
government is actuated toy considera
tions which are above the level of the
disputed question.
Respects Sacred Principles of Human-
ity - . -"'...-
"The German government attaches
no less importance to the sacred prln
ciples of humanity than the govern
ment of the United States. It again
fully takes into account that both gov
ernments for many years co-operated
in developing international law In
conformity with these principles, the
ultimate object of which has always
been to confine warfare on sea and
land to armed forces of belligerents
and safeguard as far as possible-non-
combatants against the horrors of war.
But although these considerations axe
of great weight, they alone, would not
under present circumstances have de
termined the, attitude of , the German
government. For in answer to the'ap
peal by the government of the United
States on behalf of the - sacred pnnci
pies of humanity and international law
the German government must repeal!
once more-, with all emphasis, that' It
was not the German but the British
government which Ignored all accepted
rules of international law and extend
ed this terrible war to the lives and
property of non-combatants, having no
regard whatever lor the interests and
rights of neutrals and non-combatants
that through this method of warfare
have been severely injured.
Matter of Self Defense
'Tn self defense against the Illegal
conduct of British warfare, while
fighting a bitter struggle for national
existence. Germany had to resort to
the hard but effective weapon of
submarine warfare.
Discrimination is Claimed
"As matters stand, the German gov-
ernment cannot but reiterate regret
that the sentiments of humanity
which the government of the United
States extends with such fervor to the
unhappy victims of submarine war
fare, are not extended with the same
warmth of feeling to many millions
or women and children who. accord
ing to the avowed Intention of the
British government shall be starved
and who, by sufferings, shal force the
victorious armies or the central pow
ers- into Ignominious capitulation. The
German government, In agreement
with the German people, fails to un
derstand this discrimination, all . the
more as it has repeatedly and ex
plicitly declared Itself ready to use the
submarine weapon in strict conform
ity with the rules of international
law as recognized before the outbreak
of the war, if Great Britain likewise
was ready, to adapt the- conduct of
warfare to these rules. --"
Cites British Violations
Several attempts made by the gov
ernment of the United States to pre
vail upon The British government to
act , accordingly failed because of flat
refusal on the part of the British gov
ernment. Moreover, Great Britain
again and again has violated interna
tional law, surpassing all bounds in
outraging neutral rights. The -latest
measure adopted by Great Britain de
claring German bunker coal contra
band and establishing conditions un
der which English bunker coal alone
is supplied to neutrals. Is nothing but
an unheard of attempt in the way of
exaction to force neutral tonnage Into
the service of British trade war. .
U. S. Too Easy With Great Britain
The German people know that the
government of the United States has
the power to confine the war to armed
forces of the belligerent countries In
the interest of humanity and mainte
nance of International law. The gov
ernment of the United States would
have been certain of attaining this
end had it been determined to insist,
against Great Britain on the rincon
trovertible right to freedom of the
seas. But, as matters stand, the Ger
man people are under the Impression
that the government of the United
States, while demanding that Ger
many, struggling for existence, shall
restrain the use of an effective weap
on, and while making compliance with
these demands a condition for main
tenance of relations with Germany,
confines itself to- protests against ille
gal methods adopted by Germany's
enemies.. Moreover, the German peo
ple know to what considerable extent
its enemies are, supplied with all kinds

Depends on Germany's Future Conduct
In such case, the United States might
"not reply to. the note and would await
evidence of the actual abandonment of
Germany's present practices of subma
rine warfare which is declared. Presi
dent Wilson is described by those close
about him as being in a position where
he cannot question the good faith of
Germany's . assurances, which must
stand or fall by the future conduct of
her submarine commanders.
Return to "Cruiser Warfare.' ,
The German embassy view is that
the note gives all President Wilson
asked for; that it signalizes a return to
cruiser warfare the use of subma
rines as regular naval cruisers, inter
cepting commerce with visit and
search, and that inasmuch as it makes
no mention of the armed ship question
that perplexing feature of the contro
versy is not involved.
Congress took the note quietly and
the general sentiment seemed to be in
favor of leaving the situation in the

on objection by Mr. -Austin, repubi
can, of Tennessee, Mr. London with
drew his remarks.
As reported -by the official steno-i
grapher and understood by members,
Mr. London declared working people
who were disfranchised by the bill
would, "have the right to use revol
vers, the right to use violence and
the right to kill governors."
"X demand that the member's words
be taken down." shouted Mr. Austin,
"and I wish that I could make a mo
tion to expel him from the house."
Democratic parliamentarians, in
cluding . Representatives Sherley oi
Kentucky and Garrett of Tennessee,
waged a strong fight to give Mr. Lon
don an opportunity to expiain his
words. Mr. London protested he did
not advocate violence and insisted
that he had been misquoted. What
he really said, he declared was that
disfranchised men would be "told that
they had the right to use violence."
"Don't try to blame it on the steno
graphers," Republican Leader Mann
interjected. ."'Plenty of . members
heard you." ' -
The -bill would provide that persons
not paying $3 in annual taxes on the

BUTCHER, SHOPS IN BERLIN
T r3 ARE ATTACKED BY M03
Discovery Made That Meat Was Be
ing -Withheld From Them. '
-Berlin, May 6, 1.30 p. m., via Lon
don, 8.51 p. m.i A mob gathered in
Cliarlottenburg last night and swept
through the streets, plundering two
butter shops and smashing signs and
windows or a number of other butter
shops and meat shops, inciuainif the
municipal meat shop.
' The rioting, which was soon en ! -",
was due chiefly, to indignation arou i
in the last few days by the ois,eow -that
a number of butchers were v.
holding from sale meat delivered ir j:i
by the city for sale to the poorer peo
ple, holding meat cards, or had sold
it privately at prices exceeding tha
official maximum. -
"No small part of the indignation
was probably due to the insolent
treatment of purchasers by clerks, es
pecially in butter and meat shops. Teh
police have begun a series of inves
tigations of butcher shops and already
Eave arrested a number of butchers,
who instead of selling pork delivered
to them, were salting, smoking or
making sausages from it and reserv
ing it for future sale, as the maximum
prices for these goods are much high
er than for fresh pork. .
