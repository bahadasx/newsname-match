FARM LOAN, BILL PASSED.
Mollis Measure Embodying Rural
OrodMta .Plan. Adopted by S«i»*e,
farm loan bill, embodying the admin
istration plan for establishing a sys
tem of rural credits, passed the sen
ate by a vote of 68 to 5.
Senators Brandegec. Lodge, Oliver,
Page and Wadsworth, all republicans,
voted against th© in^aau-re.
The bill, after'almost two weeks of
debate, passed the senate practically
reported by the banking commit
tee,
An amendment by Senator Smoot
reducing the salaries of the fnrm loan
board from $10,000 to $7,500, which was
adopted by a vote of 26 to 25 in the
committee of the whole, was recon
sidered when the bill reached the sen
ate and was defeated, 29 to SI.
A similar bill has been reported by
the house banking committee, and. It
is said, will be brought up for con
sideration in the house soon. Like the
senate measure, It would create a
chain of farm loan banks, but It dif
fers'in method of operation.
The senate bill provides for a non
partisan farm loan board, to consist
of the secretary of the treasury and
four others, having general control of
a farm loan system of twelve \pr more
land banks and of farm loan associa
tions, thru which loans actually would
be made.
Bach land bank would have a capi
tal atock of at least $500,000, to be sub

by the public.
The fanp loan associations would
be co-operative, made up of ten or
more farmers, who would obtain a
charter from their district land bank
A fanner desiring to become a bor­
rower
would be required to take stock
in the loan association equal to 5 per
cent of his loan, and the association ln
turn would (take an equal amount of
stock In the land bank.
On mortgages amounting to $50,000
a bank might Issue a like amount of
