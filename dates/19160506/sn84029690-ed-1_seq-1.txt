P. S. We write Insurance ia the BEST Companies.
The HAIL SEASON, which is again approaching,
reminds us of the disastrous year of 1915, when
more, than 125,000.00 was paid out in HAIL losses
to our customers. A small premium protected many
farmers who could not afford to stand the loss of
a crop which would have been disastrous to them in
a financial way.
We have no assurance what the year 1916 will
bring to us but it has been demonstrated a number
of times, that the farmer with a promising crop -.
cannot afford to carry his own risk.
We are writing for the same Old Line Companies
that gave such universal satisfaction last year,
making adjustments promptly and paying their los
ses dollar for dollar. THE CITIZENS STATE BANK
will devote all the time necessary throughout the
hail season in giving prompt and efficient service
in looking after the interests of their customers .
Should the present splendid prospects continue
it will behoove every farmer in the County to
spend a small amount in protecting his growing
crop. The rate for Ellis County this year will -be
eight per cent in all Old Line Companies, and
from the present indications we expect one of the
best Hail Writing Seasons we have ever had. We
shall be pleased to write your policy and will
appreciate the business.
Trusting that Ellis County wi'll pour forth one
of its most bounteous wheat crops and that we may
have the privilege of protecting same for you with
a Hail Policy in one of gur Companies, we are
Very truly yours,
