POVETRV IS A SOCIAL CRIME
The dally press and magazines
have contained much lately con
cerning the opinions of eugenlsts
and thoso who oppose large fam
ilies, and the following article, en
titled "Large Families of the Poor,"
by Austin. O'Malley, M. D In a re
cent publication of America, Is both
Interesting and timely. Dr. CMalley
says:
The writer asks: What 1 have to
say to those eugenlsts who hold that
"the younger children of a largo
family are nearly always defective."
They are not. Even in families that
have defective children from disease,
heredity or vice, the younger chil
dren as such do not differ from the
others except accidentally. The
eugenlsts say that "poverty-stricken
parents who undertake to raise a
great many children are unable to
give them the attention and educa
tion possible with a small family."
Any poverty-stricken mother I ever
saw, and I see such dally, gives as
much attention In essentials to ten
children as she does to three. The
same Is true for people that are not
poverty-stricken. Almost as a rule
the poor give more attention to their
ten children than the very' rich do
to their one. The rich hire a sub
stitute. That Is the reason the
rlvleras of Tophet have so many rich
visitors after the funeral. The edu
cation obtained by the poor, whether
they havo one or ten children, Is
free; and this objection has no
force.
Poverty-stricken families with
large families "forego many legiti
mate pleasures themselves and grow
old before their time." The poverty
stricken .parents, even when they
b"avec-n'lyAoneiichlIdhavenoplej.
iires' except the lass" of beer, the
pipe of tobacco, the "movies," gos
sip on the Are escape, "going to
church," and the like; and ten chil
dren will not affect such pleasures,
but enhance them. When a father
Is aged prematurely it ds not because
of the number of children. Married
men llvo longer -than the single who
have no children at all. There never
yet was a mother at her sixtieth
birthday who had raised ten children
that was half as antiquated as a
spinster of fifty who had raised
nothing to her eternal credit but
several generations of cats.
Thosn sociological Questions are,
however, extremely complicated and
not to bo dismissed readily. What
Is meant by a normally large family?
Should any man or woman marry
and bring Into the world all the chil
dren possible? Is a houseful of
starvelings better than no children
at all? Are the biologists right in
saying that such and such persons
should not njarry? Is the physician's
point of view correct? One can
readily ask questions enough like
these, but an adequate answer to
them would fill volumes. Moreover,
we must take the -world as it Is. The
blessings attainable In an Ideal
Christian society for a large family
are not for the poverty-stricken of
our society, which Is anything but
Ideal.
The poverty-stricken mother of a
largo family has trouble enough, but
those that dwell on this phase of her
condition when considering her
largo family, wholly miss the central
fact. The end and vory Justification
of marriage is to begot and to edu
cate children for the greater glory
of God and the eternal happiness of
these children. No one Is obliged to
marry, but whoever does should ful
fil the purpose of the sacrament, If
It Is physically possible to do bo;
and neither poverty nor wealth en
ters into the factor of physical
potency. The aim of. civil society
should be not to limit the number
of children among tho poverty
stricken, but to remove the causes
that make for great poverty, and
they can be removed. The poor we
shall always have with us, hut that
we have the poverty-stricken is a
social crime. It is all very charming
to talk pathetically of the poor, and
a noblo deed to spend one's life in
helping the poor, but poverty Is not
a blessing as a rule. It alawys rests
on individual or social ignorance or
crime, ,in tho poor man himself, in
.hla forbears, or in civil society.
Poverty at best, in the natural life,
Is practically always a blunder, to
say the least. Still all this is beside
the question.
Existence, no matter how sordid,
Is Immeasurably better than non
existence, for non-existence is noth
ing; and when we consider eternal
life after separation from the body
existence Tlsee to infinite possibilities
above non-existence. A human life,
even in an Australian hushman. in
a tubercular pauper, in the vilest
criminal, Is In Itself so stupendously
noble a good that the whole uni
verse exists for Its upholding toward
betterment. The raising, of human
life toward a higher condition has
been the sole tendency of all the
magnificent obarlty, sacrifice, patriot
ism and heroism of tho best men and
women of the world. The "First
Cause" itself is life, and llfo Is by
far tho most sacred thing possible for
the First Cause to effect. Eternal
life Is the reward of tho just. The
more lives, then, brought Into the
world ordinarily, for the glory of
God, tho better.
As to poverty and Its evils, If
men and women would pay more
attention to tho neglected virtue of
confidence in God, poverty would
lose all Its bitterness. St. Lawrence
was not bothered by his gridiron,
nor St. John by the cauldron of
boiling oil. This statement Is fool
ish to most folks, but It holds a
fact. With Christ in the house the
coalbln may be low yet a man can
laugh against the winds of March.
Go to your parish church some
morning and watch the old widow
who for scores of gray years has
stood In the places of poverty, but
whose heart knows how to chat with
"the Heart." The man there in dim
light whispering, "Offerlmus proe-clare-
majestatl tuao do tuls donls
ac datls hostlam puram," was her
babe that lay at her breast when
she herself went hungry. Tho girls
and boys kneeling beside her in the
crowded pew with souls white and
wonderful as her own are hers
through pain and joy. Watch her
talking to the "Father" (note that
name, will you) and to tho
mother of mothers and of God,, with
the multiple aureole of motherhood
about the faded bonnet, and you will
bo able to answer a deal of the
difficulties of the eugenlsts, or what
ever you call them, of the half-
baked thought.'

EARLY SETTLER DEAD.
Matt Brennan, one of Louisville's
best known Irishmen and pioneer
citizens, died Tuesday at his home,
1212 South Sixth Btreet, after a short
Illness, his end being hastened, it is
believed, by the death of his young
est daughter, Mrs. J. F. Hudglns,
who died two weeks ago in Indian
apolis, Mr. Brennan was a native
of Ireland and came to this country
when but a youth, serving as a
Union soldier during the Civil War
In the commissary department. Im
mediately following the war he set
t'ed In the" district known bb Limer
ick, and was one of the little band
of Catholics who worshipped at the
little frame Dominican church dn
the early sixties, and gave active aid
and help In building the present St.
Louis Bertrand church, which was
dedicated in 1870. For over thirty
years Mr. Brennan and his brother
John Brennan conducted a black
smithing and repair shop just south
of the corner of Seventh and Broad
way, retiring about twelve years ago
from business. Ho is survived by six
sons, John M William, Thomas,
Edward, Raymond and Bertrand,
and four daughters, Misses Anna and
Alice Brennan, Mrs. C. Emmet Fltz-
patrlck and Mrs. Shelby Peake. The
funeral took place from St. Louis
Bertrand's church Thursday morning
at 9 o'clock.
CALLED TO MOTHER.
Paul Fein, of New Albany, was
called to Greensburg, to visit his
mother, Mrs. Veronica Fein, who is
ill at the home of her son, the Rev.
Father Henry Fein. Mrs. Fein was
for many years a resident of New
Albany, and news of her Illness was
learned with deep regret.

Idea that the capture of the British
PoBtoffice and the severing of tele-J
graph wires In the Irish capital
were financed or instigated by the
Germans, or was timed with refer
ence to' the attempted raid by Sir
Roger Casement. But they do be
lieve that Ireland's golden opportu
nity for revolution has come, and
that the Dublin incident, whether
or not a part of a formal pro
gramme, will serve very well for
the historian of a free Ireland as
a picturesque point of departure
in short, another Boston Tea Party
or battle of Lexington.
Rioting has been going on for
months as a part of the Sinn Fein
crusade against tho recruiters.
There was an incident of this sort
a month ago at Tullamore, fifty
miles west of Dublin, where three
policemen were shot. Tho country
has been placarded with derisive
posters placed opposite every build
ing in which the British army had
established a recruiting station.
These posters bear such labels as
"England in the Last Ditch," and
"Help the Bow-Legged King Who
Couldn't Ride His Horse." Wher
ever the words "Defense of the
realm act" appear on a public notice
some Irishman has made it his busi
ness to cross out "defense" and sub
stitute "pretense." This same de
fense of the realm, at least so far
as applied to Ireland, has been one
of the chief causes of iritation de

Rev. John Cavanaugh, C. S. C, who
is a warm friend of Father Rano,
is especially glad to have secured
Father Raffo's acceptance of the in
vitation to speak on this important
occasion, for tho popular Louisville
clergyman is widely known as a

it the sequel to the fighting at
Dublin Is wholesale hanging and
shooting of Irishmen by English
officials there is no doubt of the
outcome. Under such circumstances
a war of revolution is a foregone
conclusion. But with things as they
are many believe that tho golden
opportunity for Ireland has come.
Germany is ready to help her and
has the agency for rendering such
help in her undersea boats. And
the best part of Ireland's present
opportunity is In England's presert
plight. England can not get men
to enlist, she is threatened with
conscription, het allies are Insisting
that she send more troops to the
Continent, so she certainly can not
withdraw troops already there to
fight Ireland. The peoplo In Eng
land are in a panic for fear of Ger
man invasion, and want to keep all
the troops now In England right
where they are for homo protection,
So with a fair amount of outside
help Ireland can now win the inde
pendence she has been looking for
ward to for generations. Speaking
of golden opportunities, England
had ono of her own at tho begin
ning of the war, but she threw it
away. If she had granted home
rule then, instead of postponing it
the most stupid act in the entire
history of British statesmanship
she would have had the loyal sup
port of all Ireland throughout the
European war and also the sym
pathy of the Irish-Americans.

Widespread Than the Cen
Show.
For the last five years Irishmen
have been subjected to a great
amount of exasperation from the
English governing classes. First,
the English governing classes armed
a Bantlnn nf thn Irish npnnlo in the
hrrr jlui rtt,"15r";"l'Hr '" " ii "'"
war that woulaulsgracelreland.
When the Nationalists attempted to
arm, a regiment of British soldiers,
under direction of their officer.
Major Haig, fired on an unarmed
crowd In the streets of Dublin, and
then charged with bayonets, killing
and wounding people. This was a
week before war started. The epi
sode has not been forgotten In
Dublin. Then It Is remembered,
too, that a group of British officers
were able to dictate to tho Govern
ment terms which went toward
making the home rulo measure In-,
operative. The refusal to put the
home rule measure Into law has
also exasperated Irish opinion.
Padralc Colum, the noted Irish
poet and dramatist, in New York, in
an interview, said: "I would like
to insist that the men at tho head
of tho movement over in Dublin are
no mere hot-headed fanatics, but
resolute, thoughtful men. Among
them are James Connolly, a labor
leader and author of 'Labor in Irish
History,' and Padralc Pearse, for
merly editor of a Gaelic journal, and
head master of an important school.
The rest of the leaders are, I be
lieve, very able and resolute men
and I am convinced that they are
not acting blindly or in the dark.
I want to insist again that I believe
that if Sir Roger Casement had
never gone to Genriany given tho
dangerous and exasperating condi
tions in Ireland which elxst at pres
ent this outbreak would have hap
pened." DIVISION 1 GAINING.
Division 1, A. 0. H., held Its
monthly meeting on Thursday night
of last week, with a most cheerful
and interesting gathering. Secretary
Daniel McCarthy had before him and
read voluminous correspdndence
from the National President, Na
tional Secretary and National Board
of Directors. County President Will
Jam Connolly and Secretary D. J.
O'Koefe wore among the visitors
present. During tho mooting Presi
dent Mark Ryan spoke of the hearty
support and adhesion of the mem
bers to tho principles of tho grand
old order and the rapidity with
which Division 1 has gained finan
cially and otherwise since the begin
ning of the year. Treasurer Thomas
Keenan surprised his hearers when
he read a report of the sick and
death benefits iaid members, who
now are happily off the sick list. The
Visiting Committee reported they
had none on the rick list. Receipts
of tho meeting added a goodly
amount to the resources now In tho
treasury.

GOLDEN' JUIHLEE.
Last Sunday morning Mr. and
Mrs. Thomas Hannan celebrated the
fiftieth anniversary of their mar
riage at St. James church, Bards
town road and Edenslde avenue.
April reserved its most beautiful
day for this auspicious occasion and
as the sun shone forth In all its
beauty the "bride and groom" of
fifty years, attended by their three
grandchildren, entered tho church to
tho strains of Lohengrin's "Wedding
March," proceeded to tho altar and
renewed their marlago vows. Sol
emn high mass was sung by the
pastor, Rev. E. Erie Wlllett, assisted
by Rev. Thomas W. White, Rev.
Michael Melody and Rev. James P.
Cronln, V. G. Tho music was of
surpassing excellence, Haydn's Third
Mass being sung by a choir of
twenty voices under the direction of
Mr. and Mrs. ' Hannan's daughter,
Miss Nellie B. Hannan. At tho
solemn blessing, "Believe Me, if
All Those Endearing Young
Charms," was rendered with violin
obligato by Prof. Georgo Kbllross.
The church was artistically decor
ated with palms and yellow roses
and the magnificent altars of marble
and gold enhanced the beauty of
tho sanctuary where this venerable
couple knelt and with their children
and grandchildren received our Di
vine Lord in the Blessed Eucharist.
The Rev. Thomas W. White, their
former pastor, addressed the "bride
and groom," congratulating them on
this happy occasion. He said they
were a source of edification to every
parish In which they lived and were
an honor to their children, whom
they have reared In the fear and
love of God. The solemn services
closed with the singing of the "Te
Deum." Mr. and Mrs. Hannan are
natives of Ireland. Mr. Hannan
was born In 1843 and his wlfo in
1845. They were married In this
city on April 30, 1866, at St. Pat
rick's church by tho Rev. Father
Joyce, and have lived In Louisville
for moro than fifty-five years.
Breakfast was served at tho resi
dence to the immediate family and
clergy. The color scheme of yellow
and white was carried out in all the
Ices, the tables decorated with bas
kets of yellow flowers tied with tulle
and the dates "1866-1916" in
scribed. Seated at the table with
Mr. and Mrs. Hannan were their

James, Beckham, ex-Senator Cam

be chosen as delegates to tho na

chosen as Temporary Chairman and
Attorney General Logan as Per
manent Chairman. Judge Charles
Hardin will be chosen as Chairman
of the Democratic State Committee
and Congressman J. Campbell
Cantrlll as Chairman of the Stato

schedule appears satisfactory to
everyone. Tho only fly In the oint
ment, so to speak, is that the State
leaders are still Insistent on the
selection of W. B. Haldeman as
National Committeeman to succeed
Urey Woodson. Woodson has
ceased to fight to retain his placo
and it would be fitting that Halde
man should also step aside, and
Democrats from every part of Ken
tucky say that If the Times editor
is sincere In his desire for a big
vote for Wilson and Democratic
harmony he should withdraw from
the race. Or in the event that ho
wants vindication, as some of his
friends say, let him agree that if
elected by tho convention he will
decline with thanks. This seems
to be the most popular solution.
Local Republicans and Progres
sives are trying to agree on a can
didate to make the race against
Congressman Swagar Sherley and
from present Indications "Doc"
Ryans will have the backing of the
old lino eloment in the party, Dr.
Ben Bruner tho prohibitionists, and
Joe Lawton the backing of Chesley
Searcy, who controls the machine.
It Is rumored that Judge DuRolle
may get in the contest if the Repub
licans nominate a strong Presi
dential candidate at Chicago, as he
and the others mentioned realize
that their only hope to give Con
gressman Sherley a real contest is
to be dragged through behind a
strong Presidential nominee, and
that in strictly a Congressional con
test Mr. Sherley would get mora
votes than his entire opposition com
bined. Democrats consider "Doc"
Ryans the strongest of any of those
mentioned thus far. It is believed
that the Republican machine will
throw its support to Eugene Dally
In the contest for the nomination
for Prosecuting Attornoy, because
the latter is closely allied with the
element which dominates local Re
publican politics.
There seems to be a disposition
on the part of those who kindly
select the Board of Education mem
bers for the people to work under
cover thus far and not announce
their selections too soon. It has
been the custom the past several
years for a little group to get to
gether and select candidates for
the board, the public at large hav
ing no choice In the matter what
soever. The delay this year Is
possibly because of the Indignation
aroused over the attempt of th,e
board to raise the taxes (their re
fusal to discount being equivalent
to a raise), and when the choices
are announced it will be at the last
moment. The Kentucky Irish Ameri
can has persistently fought this
mode as contrary to the spirit of
