BREAK WITH
UVERTED BY
HADE If DIPLOMATIC NOTE
United States Will Wait Fulfillment
of Promises Made by Imperial Gov
ernment on Undersea Warfare.
SLIGHTEST DEVIATION
:
rresident Wilson will irame formal
Decision Next Week; Must Consid
er England's Position Now.
BULLETIN.
WASHINGTON, May 5. It was stated authoritatively late
today that if the official text of Germany's note bears out the
unofficial copy transmitted in news dispatches today, the
United States will accept the assurances it contains and await a
fulfillment of its promises.
WASHINGTON, May 5. Germany's note litis postponed, if it
actually has not averted, a diplomatic break with thp
United States. President Wilson will make the decision
after he has read the official text which reached the state depart
ment late tonight by cable from Ambassador Gerard at Berlin. It
will be decided in time to lay it before the president tomorrow
morning.
Will Accept Assurances.
It was stated authoritatively after the cabinet meeting today that
if the official text bore out the unofficial version transmitted iu
today's Berlin news dispatches Germany's assurances undoubtedly
would be accepted, and before takinjr another step the United
States would await the fulfillment of her latest promises. In such
case the United States miht not reply to the note and would await
evidence of the actual abandonment of Germany's present prac
tices of submarine warfare, which is declared President Wilson is
described by those close about him ns beintr in a position where he
cannot question the pood faith of Germany's assurances, which must
Btand or fall by the future conduct of her submarine commanders.
Return of Cruiser Warfare.
The German embassy view is that the note gives all President
Wilson asked for; that it signalizes a return to cruTser warfare
the use of submarines as regular naval cruisers intercepting com
merce with visit and search, and that inasmuch as it makes no men
tion of the armed ship question, that perplexing feature of the con
troversy is not involved.
Congress took the note quietly and,
although members expressed a vari
ety of views, the general sentiment
seemed to be In favor of leaving the
situation In the hands of the presi
dent. On the surface there was no
sign of activity In the group which
has been working to prevent the pres
ident from pressing the situation to
the point of a diplomatic rupture.
Cabinet members went over the un
official text carefully with the presi
dent and while they uniformly re
fused to discuss It, they reflected the
view that a break had been averted;
that Germany's new assurances would
be accorded the test of time, not
withstanding the reference to the ac
tion Germany expects the United
States to take against Great Britain's
restraints on neutral trade. They ex
press this view with full realization of
constitutes a peaceful merchant- ship
entitled to the protection of interna
tional law and of the president's
steadfast determination not to per
mit the interests of the United States
with one of the belligerents to become
entangled with those of another.
The United States only recently,
declaring its views on the rights of
merchant ships on the high seas,
recognized and provided for the con
dition under which Germany charges
British merchant ships by orders of
the British admiralty actually are
acting as naval war vessels In attack
Ing submarines.
Reserves Decision.
Germany in her note reserves "com
plete liberty of decision" should the
United States fail to prevail upon
Great Britain to bring her practices
Into conformity with international
law. The official view is that the
United States for some time has been
and now is conducting' diplomatic
correspondence with Great Britain on
that subject and the success or failure
of the negotiations and Germany's
consequent action must necessarily
remain for the future.
The United States does not know
how Germany's new instructions to
submarine commanders compare with
previous instructions which were
given at the behest of President Wil
son. Secretary Lansing stated today
that It was possible the state depart
ment might ask for official copies of
the old orders.
Meet President's Demand,
The newest orders, however, ap
parently are regarded as meeting the
president's demand for a declaration
of an abandonment of the present
practices of submarine warfare. Of
ficials seem agreed Unit the presi
dent's demand that Germany also
"effect" such an abandonment only
could be answered by time.
Under such circumstances one set of
officials feel the threatened break will
not come at this time; another set is
convinced that Germany s apparent
determination to make the fulfillment
of her promises conditional upon the
uccess of the president's negotiations
with Great Britain warrants the sever
ance of diplomatic relations.
At the state department after the
situation had been thoroughly dis
GERMANY IS
ASSURANCE
WILL BRING ON WAR
- - I
cussed at the cabinet meeting it was
stated that because of the length of
the note the time required for digest
ing it carefully and the necessity of
having at h:ind thn cfficinl text for
the preservation of all shades of
meaning which might lie obscured In
wireless transmission, it Is practically
certain that the president would not
reach his decision before next week.
So More "Mistakes."
Out of It all two things were made
clear. They were that the United
States still holds firmly to its de
termination that "mistukes" of sub
marine commanders are not admissi
ble; that they are unforgivable and
that the United States must continue
to regard a discussion of the conduct
of other belligerents as irrelevant to
Its discussion of Germany's conduct.
While the tcne of the German note
was said to he disappointing most of
ficials experssed the view that after all
the language was Immaterial if the
assurances were all that had been
asked for.
At the end of the cabinet meeting
the president asked all the members
present to read the German note very
carefully and report tr. him their ma
ture views. The president remained
In his study nil day end examined the
German note very carefully. Tonlnht

parts of the country.

OKLAHOMA CITY. May 5. Coun
ty registrars should bring crimi
nal proceedings in the district court
under the conspiracy act, against any
one who sought to intimidate the pre
cinct registrars in registration of
voters, is the advice given by Gov
ernor Williams today to the Okmulgee
county registrar. This goes to nil reg
istrars alike and is the position that
the governor has taken in the matter.
Federal warrants were Issued in
Pittsburg county for two registrars,
who. It was alleged, refused to reg
ister negroes. It was understood here
today that these cases were about to
he dismissed. This is what tempered
the governor and he considered it a
trumped-up nffair to Intimidate the
registrnr. Then the governor s.iid
that the registrars could go into the
t-tate courts under the conspiracy act.
Still Complaining.
At Socialist headquarters it was
said today that complaints were still
coming in from Socialists that were
being handicapped in registering, but
they were securing their slips of pa
per In every Instapco where ul nil pos
sible. It was also stated that In many pre
cincts where, in previous elect ions,
there was a maiority of Democrats,
that about three to one were register
ing ns Socialists now. Dissatisfaction
with the Democratic rule is causing
this condition. It is stated at the head
quarters. No complaints had come into Re
publican headquarters today concern
ing registration. All complaints that
have heretofore reached ti. Kepuh
llo!n headquarters were taken up im
mediately with the office of the sec.
retary of the state election bonrH, and
they were adjusted immediately.
Louis Bonnenscheln, one of the pre
cinct registrars in Oklahoma City, re
signed today because he did not want
to register negroes. - There are about
Jive hundred in his precinct. He holds
a position with a busiiess rnncern

COSDEN TO BUILD

Makes Offer of .ff)0,000 for
Northwestern Corner
of Property.
TO ACCEPT TODAY
Special Meeting oP Hoard of
Education to Consider
Proposal.
THI AT the Cosden refinery will
X crct a ten-story office building
nt the corner of Fourth and Doston
was indicated last night when Dan
J. Davlsson, representing J. 8. Cosden
submitted to the board of education
a bid of $50,000 for the northwestern
corner of the block on which the pres
ent high school is situated.
It was the only bid received and
there was every indication lust night
that It would be acted upon favorably
at a special meetin-r of the board to
be held this ufternoon at 3 o'clock.
In the meantime the f'nance commit
tee of the board will confer with the
prospective buyer regarding details of
the transaction.
Mr. Cosden Is In New York at pres
ent, but his agent Mr. Davlsson, stated
that it Is the intentb n of his client
to put up a large and modern office
building on the sin as soon as the
title can be cleared end the deal con
summated. Needs Office Smee.
"Mr. Cosden Is paying rent on a
largo amount of office space at pres
ent and he will huve to secure more
room soon as his business is increas
ing at a rapid rate." said Mr. Davison.
"Therefore he has decided to build his
own office building. '
He pointed out that the erection of
such a building would greatly en
hance the vulue of the rest of the
high school block. The board has
never called for bids on tho remain
ing portion, but probably will attempt
to lease It at u later date. A bid of
$50,000 on the northwestern corner
was received from R. M. McKurlln
some time ago, but the deal fell
through on account of an adverse
ruling by the prospective purchaser's
attorneys as to the title.
Roth Mr. Cosden und Mr. Davlsson
feel (but they can secure a good title
to the property. The attorneys of
the school board are of the same
opinion.
Frontage on lloston.
The property has a frontage of one
hundred feet on iinston avenue and
140 reel on Fourth street and tho
building that Mr. Cosden proposes to
erect probably will be of the same
dimensions as the (iallais building
now nearing completion on the north
eastern corner of the intersection of
Fourth and Roston.
Stebbins. Kyesenbach & Oiddlngs
informed tho board last night by let
ter that they had Intended bidding
on one-half of the corner and were
ready to make a proposition for leas
ing the rest of the block at any time

was said tonight.
It is expected General Obregon will
bold his next conference with Gen
eral Scott tomorrow on tho Ameri
can side of the Rio Cran io and that
a protocol covering the agreement will
then be drawn up.
It had heon the expectation of Gen
erals Scott and Funston that the final
meeting with General Obregon would
lake place today. At tho last mo
ment, however, it was learned that
General Carranza still held to the
opinion that tho American troops
should set a definite, and early data
lor withdrawal. It was said that a
lurgo purt or tuduy wus spent by the
Mcxicuu officials here in tonvin-'lng

ment should bo adhered to in tho

It is asserted, however, that there
are still a few details not yet as
sented to by General Curranxu and
that these will have to be thrushed
out at the next meeting between
Generals Scott und Obregon. Cer
sons in a position to know say that
the matters In dispute are bound to
bo adjusted.
The only event of the dav on the
American side of the Rio Grande was
General Funston's receipt of message
from General J. J. I'ershing In which
he said Vlllu hud been located. The
general gave no details except that
the American troops were not a great
distance from tho spot where tho
bandit was supposed to lie. officials
here were inclined to think that there
was a chance that the expeditionury
commander might soon get in touch
with Villa bunds.
Simultaneously with the receipt of
General Pershing's messuge enme a
report from Juarez thut Villa had
been seen at Santiago Papusquiaro. In
