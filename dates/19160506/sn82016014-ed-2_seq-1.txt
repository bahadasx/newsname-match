there were no American casualties.
The American command under MaJ.
Kolrert L. Howze has been pursuing
the Villa bandits under Gens. Cruz
)minguez and Julio Acosto for sev
eral days when they encountered
them, encamped in the huddled adobe ,
jackals of Ojo-Aztdes.
The Mexicans were completely sur
prised and sprang from tlieir pallets
half clothed. After firing a few wild
shots, they fled, each man shifting: for
himself, some of them were able to
seize their horses, already jaded from
a hard day's ride previously, but oth
ers made their way into the hills
afoot.
In Major Howze's report he said the I
rout tiau been absolute, and that he
was still pursuing scattered remnants
of the band. The band engaged is the
largest.
The band engaged is the largest re
maining under the Villa standard and
today's decisive victory gave much sat
isfaction to military men here. While
the dispatch does not state, military
men on the border believe that the
band is the same as that which was
defeated at Temochic April 22 by Col.
(Jeorse A. Dond's command.
Capture 75 Horses.
San Antonio, May 6. Forty-two
Villistas were killed, a number wound
ed and 7 5 horses and mules captured
in a surprise attack delivered by six
troops of the Eleventh cavalry at Ojo
Azules early yesterday morning. A
report on the fight was forwarded
from El Paso by General Funston.
There were no American casualties. '
The American troops commanded by
Major Robert L. Howze made a night
ride of 36 miles from San Antonio to
surprise the bandits. So unexpected
was the attack that the Mexicans fled
without offering organized resistance.
The hand numbered 140 men and was
commanded by Dominguez, Acosta and
Angeles.
Drove :!B Miles to Battle.
The Villistas arrived at Ojo-Azules
the night before and attempted to take
the town from the Carranza garrison.
Meeting with resistance, they decided
to wait until morning before renewing
the effort.
Major Howze at San Antonio, 36
miles to the north, learned of the sit
uation and at once set out with six
troops of the Eleventh cavaltry to re
lieve the town. The command reached
the outskirts of Ojo Azules shortly be
fore dawn and took the bandits com
pletely off their guard. Five Car
ranza soldiers held for execution by
the band, were released when the
outlaws were put to flight.
General Pershing's Report.
El Paso, May 6. General Pershing's
official report of the defeat of a band
of Villa s men at Ojo-Azules, by Ma
jor Howze, described the action as a
cavalry charge with pistols, the first
to occur since operations were begun.
The men had ridden 36 miles from
San Antonio to Ojo-Azules, 17 miles
southwest of Cusihuiriachic.
The pursuit of the scattered Mexi
cans was continued for two hours. In
formation that the band was near
Ojo-Azules had been secured by Gen
eral Pershing two days before. It was
said to have attacked and defeated a
'arranza force a few days before
that. The commanders were Cruz
Dominguez, Antonio Angeles and Julio
Acosta. General Pershing reported
that the counted dead was 42. Seventy-five
horses and mules were tak
en from the Mexicans and six Car
ranza prisoners .they had been hold
ing for execution. Many wounded were
reported but the number was not
given.
Reiort Te Facto Start Clash.
Kl Paso, May 6. "Somewhere north
of Parral." American troops have been
attacked by Carranza detachments of
Oeneral Luis Herrera's brigade. Con
fidential advices to this effect have
been received here by American min
ing men from agents in Parral. Anti
American demonstrations have been
in progress in and around Parral since
yesterday, these messages said.
Eighteen Americans are in the min

Tr-ie information was transmitted
to Generals Scott and Funston.

"Interventionists" Predict Wid

TRUCE WITH VILLA LEADERS
Bandit Generals Would Join
Mar Against IT. S.
Mex-U. S. Conference To Be
Continued Today.
El Paso, May 6. General Scott and
General Funston planned today to
hold another -:onference with Gen
eral Obregon in the expectation that
before it ended, the suggestions of the
United States .rovernment for co
operative disposal of the Villa bands
in Mexico would take the form of a
duly signed protocol.
Prior to the meeting, however, came
reports from Juarez '..hat were n t
quite so optimistic. It was reported
that the negotiations might extend into
still another session of he conferees
because General Carranza had ex
pressed a wish for further discussion
of the subject of the withdrawal of
the American troops.
While the American conferees will
listen attentively to any suggestion
submitted by General Obregon, there
is no chance that any change in the
attitude of the United States will take
place it was said here, except on minor
details. The fact that General Car
ranza did not immediately endorse the
tentative agreement entered into by
General Obregon was seized upon by
the "interventionists" here, who have
been predicting a break between the
first chief and his minister of war.
They declare that the present situa
tion is but a forerunner of a wider
split to come between the two men.
Truce With Villistas.
. From authentic Mexican sources, it
is learned, that during the conference
held here and in Juarez, an inter-party
truce has existed in Mexico with the
understanding that if trouble arises
between the de facto government and
the United States, all factions would
unite against the common enemy.
General Trevino is reported to have
received messages by telegraph from
various Villa chiefs saying that they
are ready to put sixteen million rounds
of ammunition now hid in the moun
tains as well as their own services at
the disposal of the first chief, should
a break occur with Washington.
"There are now no Villa bands, only
bandits,' was the comment of General
Obregon today when the subject of
operations against Villa was men
tioned. "There are no Villistas. as their
cause is dead and gone," Obregon
continued. "It is now only a hunt aft
er outlaws without a flag. It is only
a matter of time and diligence before
they are cleared out of our country."

tenced to death with Major McBride
wore commuted to life imprisonment.
TRAIN HIT OIL WAGON
Santa Fc Cars Scorch When Contents
Ignited in Topeka This Morning.
A Standard Oil company tank wag
on was totally demolished and more
than 500 gallons of oil was lost when
the wagon was struck by Atchison,
Topeka & Santa Ye tram No. 12. near
Seventh and Hancock streets, shortly
after 6 o'clock this morning.
The oil was ignited by a spark from
the engine and the pilot of the engine
and several cars were scorched con
siderably. No one was hurt.
L. C. Rahn, owner of the Capital
Shirt factory, was on Santa Fe train
No. 12 when it struck the oil wagon.
"It caused no little excitement on
the train," he said. "When the first
lurch came everyone thought we were
wreu. x nen u was discovered
'that the engine had struck a tank of
oil. We looked out and saw the
j flames leaping up around the sides of
jthe mail car. The engineer undoubt
iedly thought it wouldn't do to burn up
ithe mail, so he pulled up until the
flames began to lick the sides of the
coach. Tou should have seen the oc
cupants scramble out of that car. One
; man had a coat badly scorched. Once
more the engineer pulled up and as
the entire train pulled through that
fire the sides of the cars, Pullman
and all. were burned."

TO OTHER BANKS
Shawnee County Sends $50,000
to Country Institutions.
Three Per Cent Paid When To
peka Bankers Refuse.
Shawnee county will draw 3 per cent
interest on at least fifty thousand dol
lars of its funds.
The county commissioners have
authorized the county treasurer to
place that amount on time deposit in
three banks located outside of Topeka.
Twenty thousand dollars will be placed
in each of the two banks at Rossville
and ten thousand dollars will be placed
in the bank at Silver Lake. These
amounts will be deposited by the
county treasurer for given periods of
time and he will take out time cer
tificates in his own name, as county
treasurer.
All of these banks have been carry
ing some county money but have been
carrying it on daily balance and have
been paying 2 M per cent interest on
it. When the Topeka banks got to
! gether and announced that beginning
I May 1 they would pay the county only
i 2 per cent interest on daily balances
j the commissioners looked for a hole.
! They asked W. E. Atchison, county
i attorney, for an opinion as to whether
or not they could place the county s
money on time deposit. The opinion
was favorable and the instructions to
the county treasurer were issued yes
terday. Fifty thousand dollars is only a
small part of the county's funds but
the rate to be paid by the outside
banks is one-half of one per cent more
than the county has been receiving in
Topeka heretofore and one per cent
more than it will receive on daily bal
ances under the new order.

(Supreme Court Decisions on page 17.)
Dick Cooley does not need to pay for
intoxicating liquor delivered to him by
Danciger Brothers of Kansas City dur
ing the time Cooley was owner of the
Topeka baseball team. The supreme
cour ttoday held the sale of liquors to
Cooley an evasion of the Kansas pro
hibitory liquor law and affirmed the
verdict of the Shawnee county district
court -in denying the liquor company
a Judgment.
During the time oColey was owner
of the Topeka Western league base

sions consigned by Danciger Brothers
of Kansas City to themselves in To
peka. Here an agent is said to have
delivered the bills of lading to Cooley.
who took the liquor from the express
or freight offices.
When Cooley sold his ball team, he
is said to have owed the Kansas City
liquor house several hundred dollars.
Proceeds of the sale were attached,
the Dancigers taking action both for
themselves and other liquor houses.
When the case was called for trial, a
demurrer was sustained and judgment
entered for the defendant.
It was held by the court that the
sale was an evasion of the Kansas pro
hibitory liquor law. Title to the liq dor
didn't change until the shipment had
reached Kansas, it was held, and for
that reason the sale was made in Kan
sas in violation of law and the account
was not collectable in a court of rec
ord. In one of the cases th; defend
ant pleaded payment of the accounts
and a jury found for him. In the oth
ercases, demurrers were sustained.
"A principal who employs an agent
to make collections under circum
stances which make the act a viola
tion of the criminal law, cannot main
tain an action for the recovery of the
amount collected," said Justice Mason
in deciding the case.
Must Get an Order.
When attorneys win fees in divorce
cases, they must get court orders for
their fees promptly if they would in
clude the fee as a part of the decree
' divorce. That was the ruling of the
supreme court today in a case from
Gove county.
Rebecca M. Eisenbise secured a di
vorce decree from J. M. Eisenbise. An
attorney's fee of J250 was allowed.
The attorney, however, neglected to
secure the incorporation of his fee in
the decree. Now he must bring a
separate suit against Eisenbise to win
the $250.
More Compensation Cases.
The supreme court clarified some
of the legal muddle surrounding in
terpretations of the workmen's com
pensation act when it todav Dassed on
three cases involving the big labor
law.
In a suit by S. O. Gailey against
tne oeet tirotners Manructuring com
pany of Wyandottee county, the court
held that an employee who was par
tially disabled through injury does not
lose his right under the compensation
taw though he remain in the employ
of the company. Another case was
that of J. H. Ruth against the With-erspoon-Englar
company, in which
the supreme court reversed the action
of the Wyandotte county district court.
In this case the court held an em
ployee was entitled to injuries which
he received in connection with his
work, but was not entitled to compen
sation for alleged malpractice of sur
geons employed by the defendant com
pany. A third case was that of Albert
W. Taylor against the Sulzberger &
Sons company, also of Wyandotte
county. The court in this case held 1
that a son could not collect compen
sation for the death of his mother.
even though she contributed to his
support. The woman lived with her
son. who was head of a household of
a wife and child. The mother lived
with them, contributed to the mainte
nance of the home, but was not re
garded as a member of the family.
Horses, Cows and Chickens Exempt.
When a man keps a horse, a cow or
chickens in his barn, he is not violat
ing the city health ordinance unless he
persists in depositing refuse in places
that make such an act dangerous to
health or welfare of a community.
That was the decree of the supreme
court today in a case testing the val
idity of an ordinance of the city of
Goodland, Sherman county.
L. W. Popejoy brought suit to test
the Goodland ordinance. The court
held that the ordinance which pro
hibited depositing of cans, manure,
ashes and garbage on property of citi
zens was invalid because the town
council did not state whether the de
posit was a nocuous or inocuous de
posit. Enforcement of the ordinance
would prohibit the keeping of a cow,
horse or chickens in a barn, regard
less of the cleanliness of the barn."
Decides Old Case.
The supreme court today decided a
sixty-year-old case when it gave to the
J. W. Stark estate of Kansas City,
property which they had obtainted
through accretions. The accretion
came with a flood in 1867 when there
was an ice gorge in the Kaw river.
The land was claimed to have been
taken from Howe's island and title was
claimed by Hunter M. Meriweather.
Suits concerning accretions from the
flood and ice gorge of 1877 have for
years been in the state and United
States courts. The decision today
gives the land to the Stark estate.

the American demands in hand. The
president himself received the official
text today but the White House with

So completely do' officials in touch
with the situation consider the issue
disposed of, it is said, there will be no
reply by the president to the German
note. There may be a statement by
Secretary Lansing, however, calling
attention to the essential point in the
note that Germany has ordered sub
marine attacks confined to vessels of
war. This is the essence of the kaiser's
reply, officials say, and leaves no
actual issue with Germany.
The issue will remain closed, of
ficials believe. They feel Germany
will not reopen it by resuming warfare

Xot long ago the word was passed

there was still in operation in Shaw

of the state house dome "the worm"
was changing good Shawnee corn and
rye into a brand of liquor that would
make the proverbial jackrabbit spit In
the proverbial bulldog's face.
The officers had the alleged location
of the still. It was about twelve
mile? distant from the court house.
They laid plans for an early morning
raid. It was planned to leave Topeka
about 3 o'clock in the morning in
automobiles and swoop down upon the
operators of the still when they
changed shifts. Everything was going
fine and the officers expected to make
a clean up.
Then came the climax the kind
with an "anti" prefixed.
Some home-grown detective made a

Washington. May . Overshadow
ing in many minds the question of
the president's acceptance of the Ger
man reply is interest in the small par
agraph in the heart of the German
note relating to peace. When the
president replies to Germany this
paragraph may or may not be
touched upon. Nevertheless, officials
today th guarded manner intimated
frankly that something may result di
rectly from Germany's plain indica
tion that she is anxious for pece.
The conference between Ambassa

looms large in the minds of oftirials
here. It never had been seriously
thought that the emperor discuused
details of the submarine issue with
the American ambassador. Since the
arrival here of the German note, ths
belief has grown strong that peace
may have played a prominent part in
that conference.

declaration that she yields to the
president's demands because she be
lieves it would be a calamity if the
war were prolonged or increased in
scope these decisions, if not actual
indications of uneasiness over the fu
ture, are at least appeals to this coun
try for formative steps that will stop
the carnage, according to the ex
pressed beliet in German circles as
well as in administration quarters.
It may be said with certainty that
some of those close to the president
believe he should and may tentatively
sound out the warring powers on the
question ot a possible peace as a re
sult of the German note. One of these
men said today:
Nation Sick of Conquest.
"We hear in this (the German re
ply) not the voice of the braggart or
buly but the voice of a nation sick
and tired of the endless fight. It is
the heart and soul of Germany speak
