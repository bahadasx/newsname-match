New Instructions Are Sent to
All Commanders of German
Submarines.
•Berlin, by wireless via Sayville, N.
Y., (May f».—(Following is the text of
he note of the German government
in reply to the American note re­
specting submarine warfare delivered
on Tuesday by Gottlieb von Jagow,
the foreign secretary, to Ambassador
Gerard:
"The undersigned, on behalf of the
imperial German government, has the
honor to present, to his excellency, the
ambassador of the United States, Mr.
James \V. Gerard, the following reply
to the note of April 20, regarding the
conduct of 'German submarine war
fare:
"The German government handed
over to the proper naval .authorities
for* eativ investigation the evidence
concerning the Sussex as communi­
cated by the government of the Unit­
ed States. Judging by results that
the investigation has hitherto yield­
ed, the Gorman government is alive
(o the possibility that the ship men­
tioned in the note as having been tor
pedoed by a German submarine is act­
ually identical with the Sussex.
"The German government begs to
reserve further communication on the
matter until certain points are ascer­
tained, which are of decisive import­
ance for establishing the facts of tho
case. Should it turn out that the,com
mander was wrong in assuming the
vessel to bo a man-of-war, the Ger­
man government will not fail to draw
consequence resulting therefrom.
"In connection with the case of the
Sussex the government of (he United
States made a series of statements.
Hie gist of which is the assertion (hat
the incident is to lie considered In11
one instance of a deliberate method
of indiscriminate destruction of ves­
sels of ali sorts, nationalities and dis­
tinctions by German submarine coin
ma nilers.
"The German government most em­
phatically repudiates the assertion.
The German government, however,
thinks it of little avail to enter into
details in the present stage of affairs,
more particularly as the government
of Hie United States omitted to sub­
stantiate the assertion by reference
lo concrete lads.
"The German government, will only
slate thai it has imposed far-reaching
leslrainls upon the use of the subma­
rine weapon, solely in consideration
of neutrals' interests., in spite of Hie
fact that these restrictions are neces­
sarily of advantage lo Germany's ene­
mies. No such consideration has ever
been shown neutrals by Great Hril
ain and her allies.
International Law.
"The German submarine foree.i
have had, in facl, orders to conduct
submarine warfare in accordance with
the general principles of visiL and
search and the destruction of mer­
chant vessels recognized by interna­
tional law, (he sole exception being
the conduct of warfare against enemy
trade carried on enemy freight, ships
encountered in the war zone sur­
rounding Great Britain. With regard
to these, no assurances have ever
been given to the government of the
United States. No such assurances
are contained in the declaration of
February 8, 191 (i.
"The German government cannot
admit any doubt that these orders
were given or are executed in good
faith. Errors actually occurred. They
can in no kind of warfare against an
enemy resorting to all kinds of ruses,
whether permissible or illicit.
Neutral Rights.
''E'ut apart from the possibility of
errors, naval warfare, just like war­
fare on land, implies unavoidable dan­
gers for neutral persons and goods
entering the fighting zone. Even in
cases where the naval action is con­
fined to ordinary forms of cruiser
warfare, neutral persons and goods
repeatedly come to grief.
"The German government has re­
peatedly and explicitly pointed out
the dangers of mines that have led to
the loss of numerous ships.
"The German government has made
several proposals to the government
of the United States in order to re­
duce the minimum for American trav­
elers and goods the innocent dangers
of naval warfare. Unfortunately, the
government of the United States de­
cided not to accept the proposals. Had
it accepted the government of the

CRISIS ON THE SUBMARINE ISSUE
WILSON HAS MADE NO DECISION
Teutons {Insist That Great Britain Must
Also Be Held to Same Strict Account­
ability or Submarines Will Return
to the Old Style of Warfare.
CABINET MEMBERS GO
OVER REPLY INFORMALLY
Washington, May f.—(iermany's note has postponed, if it ac­
tually has not iverted, si diplomatic break with the United States.
President Wilson will make the 'decision after he has read the offi­
cial text, which reached the State department late tonight by cable
from Ambassador Gerard at Berlin. It. will be deciphered in time
lo lay it before the president tomorrow morning.
it was stated authoritatively after the cabinet meeting today
that if the official text, bore out the unofficial version transmitted in
today's Berlin news dispatch, Germany's assurance undoubtedly
would be accepted, and before taking another step the United
States would await further fulfillment of her latest promises.
MIGHT NOT REPLY.
In such cases, the United States might not reply to the notci
and would await, evidence of the actual abandonment of Germany's
present practices of submarine warfare, which is declared.
President Wilson is described by those close about
ing in a close position where he cannot question
Germany which must stand or fall by the future conduct
submarine commanders.
CONCEDES EVERYTHING.
The German embassy view is that the note gives all President
Wilson askft for-: 'ft'.irtut-jrlti a'**bruiserwafrfairc''
—the use of submarines as regular cruisers intercepting
eoniraerot*
with visit and search, and that inasmuch as it. makes no mention
of
the ariiivd ship question, that perplexing feature of the controversy
is not involved.
TAKE IT QUIETLY.
Congress took the nole quietly and although members expressed
a variety of views, the general sentiment seemed to be in favor of
leaving the situation in the hands of the president.
Cabinet members went, over the unofficial text, carefully with
the president, and while they uniformly refused to discuss it, they
reliedcd the view that a. break had been averted that Germany's
new assurances would lie accorded the test of time, notwithsanding
I lie reference to the net ion Germany expects the United States to
take against, Greal Britain's restraint, on neutral trade. They ex­
pressed this view with full realization with the difference of opinion
nil what constitutes a peaceful merchant ship entitled to the pro­
tection of international law, and the president's steadfast deter­
mination intl to permit the inteivests of the United States with on3
of the belligerenls to be cntagled with those of another.
MUST FORCE GREAT BRITAIN.
Germany in her note reserves "complete liberty of decisions,"
should the United Slates fail to prevail upon Great, Britain to bring
her practices into conformity with international law. The official
view is that the United Slates for sometime has been and now is
conducting negotiations with Great Britain on that subject and the
success or failure of the negotiations and Germany's consequent ac­
tions must necessarily remain for the future.
The United States does not know how new instructions to sub­
marine commanders compare with the other instructions given at
the bequest of President, Wilson. Secretary Lansing said today it
was possible the State department might ask for copies of the old
orders.
The newest, orders, however, apparently are regarded as
ing the president's demands for declarations of an abandonment of
the present practices of submarine warfare.
ANSEWERED BY TIME.
Officials seemed agreed that the president's
many also "effect'' such an abandonment only
by time.
Under circumstances, one set of officials feel
ened break will not come at this time another set
Germany's apparent determination to make the
promises conditional upon the success of the
tions with Great Britain warrants the severance
relations.
At the State department after the situation
oughly discussed at the cabinet meeting, it was stated
of the length of the note, the time required for

preservation of all shades of meaning which might

unforgiveable and that the United States must

While the tone of the note was said to be
