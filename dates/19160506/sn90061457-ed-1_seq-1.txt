ST. JOSEPH, MISSOURI, SATURDAY, MAY 6, 1916
NUMBER 31
AND STILL THE REPUBLICAN
ADMINISTRATION 6 IK THE SOUP
With All the Promises of Its Campaign
Press Agents Its Revenue
is Short.
And This Must Be So for It Is Vouched
For 'By the Marshall
Organ.
When the Republican spellbinders
from (ho housetops racously tore
up the lambient air In the late city
campaign from the alleys and cellars
from all directions came the cheerful
assurance that St. Joseph under Re
publican administration would end the
fiscal year with "a. substantial balance
to Its' credit." In other words, under
the wise and efficient management of
the Republican party there was and
would be "money to burn" after the
Marshall administration submitted Its
annual report. It was also just as
loudly proclaimed that the holes in
the Btreets troubles, the parks and
boulevard propositions, and the multi
farious "other promises which pertain
to an administration had been com
plied with and that there was still
"money to burn."
This had, it would seem, some in
fluence with the voters, for the Mar
shall administration was endorsed by
a loud and enthusiastic majority so
loud and enthusiastic, in fact, that it
is almost forgotten that there was any
Democratic vote to speak of which
showed that the dear peop. wanted
a few more years of the kind of stuff
that they had enjoyed heretofore.
Democrats Were Prevaricators ,
Well, just to keep up the argument;
every time that a Democrat who of
course knew got up on'a cottonwood
stump and in ordinary parlance stated
during that super-heated period that
St. Joseph instead of having "money
to burn" was in the nine hole, he was
so emphatically denounced the next
afternoon by the Republican News
Press and that night by the Repub
lican spellbinders when they arose
on their own personally conducted
stumps, that they were ready to feel
that their labors were in vain that
they were making some sort of asses
of themselves that In fact they were
plying a wrong vocation and that
the best thing that they could do was
to take a Billy Sunday repentance and
call It all off that they were In fact
making fools of themselves and did
not know anything except to talk with
their mouthB.
ON course, all St. Joseph voters
were supposed to listen when the Re
publican News-Press spoke and also
WILL FIGHT SWANGER
The Lamm and Morris Factions Will
Make It Extremely Hot for the
Swanger Srowd
The war in the Republican guber
natorial campaign has opened and
opened In earnest for from ihis time
on there will be no quarter and the
now drawn knives and displayed
snickersnees will be much in evidence.
Quarter will not be asked and if it
were would not be granted by either
side.
The hostilities mean much to St.
Joseph's Republican candidate for the
empty honor of the Republican nom
ination for governor our own Charley
Morris for it means that he must
fight, and fight hard, and it he does
fight and fight hard, he stands the
chance of being thrown down by his
own party and for his personal con
solation so does Judge Henry Lamm
of Sedalia.
And It all comes about through the
fact that on Wednesday night the Kell-Graves-Schmoll
faction of the St.
Louis Republican city committee
voted a most eloquent and enthusias
tic endorsement of John Swanger!
empty idea that he might sometime
be governor of Missouri, and thereby
cut out all of the aspirations of our
own Charley Morris and Hen Lamm,
the latter of Sedalia. This to these
two aspirants spelled the word war In
big capitals, and now they propose to
have a fight that will be some scrap.
when the Republican Mump orators
told their story of that prosperity un
der the Marshall Republican adminis
tration. They were supposed to swal
low those "money to burn" stories,
no matter if they scorched a trifle as
they sizzled down.
The election Is all over. St. Joseph
is safely Republican again. Mayor
Marshall is in the chair. The whole
country is now really safe.
The News-Press Statement
Now that it is safe really safe
let us all read this little bon mot
which appeared In the Republican
News-Press in this the year of our
Lord, Wednesday, May 3, 1910, Read
it carefully:
"Instead of a balance in the city's
general fund from last year, as had
been expected, there is a deficit -of
$17,r55, This amount will have to be
taken by this year's revenue In order
to satisfy last year's obligations.
Until now it had been common re
nort at the city hall that the fiscal
year would be ended with a substan
tial balance in the general revenue
fund.
There has been no mentioning above
i whisper at the city hall concerning
this deficit, and It appeared to be the
general impression that the city had
ended the fiscal year with a balance,
n fact, the annual report of Frank M.
Lenimon, city comptroller, which had
oeen submitted to the city council,
recited that there was a balance avail
able for appropriation from last year's
?eneral fund of $4,673.05.
"The bill for fire hydrant service for
he quarter ending April 1 is a month
past due and the members of the city
council have learned that the city has
no way of paying It except to take the
money out of the collections for this
year.
"The balance of $4,675.03 shown by
Lemmon's report was dissipated and
the council had to dip Into this year's
collections In order to pay the police
lepartment salaries last month. Lem
mon said today that at the time he
made out his report the police salaries
were not due (they are paid the first
of each month), but that when they
did fall due there was not enough in
the general fund to pay them. The
total for salaries was $10,300. After
applying the balance of $4,675 to this
amount there remained $5,625 unpaid.
This was taken from this year's reve
nue, thus, with the amount to be paid
the water company, setting the city
back $17,555."
Get that?
Morris and Lamm propose to fight it
out by charging the KielGraves
Schrnoll faction of the city commit
tee with trying to usurp the right of
the people to nominate their own can
didate in the statewide primary elec
tion August 1. An attack upon the
Kiel-Graves-Schmoll faction similar to
the attack that James A. Reed made
upon the Democratic city committee
of St. Louis, in 1910, when it refused
to permit him to speak at any of its
meetings because it was "tied up"
with David R. Francis, will be made
by the Lamm and Morris leaders, and
they propose to make the "fur fly"
and It will.
St. Joseph should have the empty
honor of having the Republican can
didate for governor selected from Its
citizens, but it now looks as though
the atmosphere was a trifle foggy.
HOLDS GOOD ELSEWHERE
What Is Right In Congressman Ruck-
ers District Is Right In the
Other Districts
"He's had the office so long; he
doesn't need it any longer" is the ar
gument we hear against W. W. Rucker
for congress. Is this sufficient reason
for discharging a roan from public
service? True, Mr. Rucker has repre
sented this district in congress for a
long time but, baen't he given good
service? Just Buppose, friend reader,
that you were ln-jbusiness (perhaps
you are), and that you had in your
employ a man who had been with you
for many years; he had mastered the
business thoroughly and you knew him
to be absolutely trustworthy. Would
you discharge this person at a critical
time in your business affairs Just In
order to give a new man a chance?
It is not likely that jou would. A
congressman Is nothing more nor less
than an employe of the public; you
can cither discharge him or you can
keep him in your hire. The Second
district does not owe to Ralph Lozier,
to William W. Rucker, nor tc any
other particular man, a job in the
White House, but the people you and
I owe It to ourselves to place the
man there who will discharge the du
ties to the best advantage for all con
cerned. We don't give a snap whether
the man's name is Rucker or Lozier,
or whatever else, but if you're going
to discharge u. man from office, "for
the love o Mike," have some better
reason than that he has served jou
faithfully for twenty years. Stouts

BRYAN MAY BE ALTERNATE
Is Possible That the Nebraskah
May Yet Get Into the St.
Louis Convention
Lincoln, Neb., May 1. William J.
Bryan, defeated candidate for dele-gate-at-Iarge
to the Democratic na
tional convention, received eighteen
votes as alternate, according to offi
cial count thus far, and hence may
go to the convention as an alternate
delegate. His name was written in.
In case he Is declared elected alter
nate delegate, he will be eligible to a
seat in the St. Louis convention if any
of the regular delegates should see fit
to give their place to him. W. H.
Thompson and J. J. Thomas, two
Bryan men, were elected.
Charles W. Bryan gets the Populist
nomination for governor with 184
votes. Keith Neville's vote was 101.
James Pearson of Moorefield received
the Populist nomination for lieutenant
governor, according to Secretary
Pool's totals computed today.
DAVID NEALE DEAD
He Helped to Save Many of the Rich
Acres Along the Missouri
River Front
David Neale, who was quite well
known here from the fact that his de
vice was used all along the river front
from Rulo to Kansas City, in protect
ing the banks of the Missouri from
erosion, died at Fort Colhoun, Neb.,
last Sunday, at the age of 82 jears.
He was born Jan. 2, 1834, and went
to Nebraska sixty years ago, settling
near Fort Colhoun, where he resided
up to the time of his death, with the
exception of 1873, when he was agent
on the Ponca reservation In Dakota.
He was married In IS' i, and his
wife and four children survive. David
Neale was one of the most useful citi
zens in the state of Nebraska and was
widely known-as the inventor of the
anchor rip-rap, consisting of fascines
of willows anchored and built up Into
bank protection. It is in general use
throughout the United States, particu
larly along parts of the Missouri and
Red rivers. The Missouri Pacific rail
road has used Neale's method of prp-
tectlon to Its right-of-way along the
river banks for many years. During
the past few years the old Inventor
has been sightless, and his mind had
reached, the stage known as second
childbdod.
HOMESICK
I am homesick for Missouri
There is where I'd like to be,
At home among God's people,
And the friends who care for me.
1 hate this great, big, lonesome place
And the restless'crowds I see
I am homesick for Missouri;
There is where 1 want to be.
1 am homesick for Missouri,
Where I've lived since quite a child,
Where the seasons are a pleasure,
Though at times not always mild;
Where the sky to me looks brighter.
And the earth has greater charm
1 am homesick for Missouri
And the old home on the farm.
1 am homesick for Missouri,
And there's where I vant to go
Where the slelghbells make sweet music
In the days of ice and snow;
Where the cheeks look round and healthy,
Where there's sparkle In the eye
I am homesick for Missouri
There I want to live and die.

ruptey Court
St Louis, May 2. Charles W.
Well, until recently treasurer of
the Meyer Brother Drug com-
panj, filed a voluntary petition in
bankruptcy in the United States
district court here toda. He gave
his liabilities as $923,691.65 and
his assets as $300, all Included in
his claims of exemptions.
RUSH IN FIRST
And That It the Way That It Will Be
When the Primary Ballots
Are Counted In August
By one of those unfortunate errors
which will occur in the best regu
lated newspapers (the Republican
NewB- Press not excepted), it was
made to appear in these columns last
week that Roy Rush, the energetic
and capable young Democrat who is
making the race for the nomination
for representative from the FIrBt dis
trict, was asking for the place from
the Third district.
Mr, Rush is one of the most capa
ble business men of the First district,
wfilch is made up of the First, Second
and Third wards of the city of St.
Joseph. He is a man who will fit
tingly and capably represent the peo
ple of St. Joseph in the next legisla
ture, and the voters of those wards
will send him there.
WERE QUIETLY WED
Dr. and Mrs, F. H. Spencer Surprised
Their Relatives With a Dinner
Announcement
Sunday last when 3 o'clock dinner
was called at the home of Mr. and
Mrs. J. W. Spencer, 607 Bon Ton
street, and the family were all seated,
Dr. F. H. Spencer made a short but
very pleasant statement that ran in
this line: "Folks, I would like to pre
scnuyou to my wife, Mrs. F. H. Spen
cer we were married yesterday eve
ning at the Cathedral parish by Rt.
Rev.. Maurice F. Connor, and that's
all."
Dr. Spencer's statement was suffi
cient and the new daughter was warm
ly welcomed Into the family circle.
The bride was Miss Mary Dalgarn of
this city, a very pretty and attractive
joung woman and a niece of Mr. and
Mrs. Samuel Lawrence of Kansas City.
Monday evening Mr. and Mrs. J. W.
Spencer entertained a large number
of Dr. Spencer's professional and busi
ness friends at an informal stag
luncheon, thirty guests being present.
Dr. and Mrs. Spencer will reside at 607
Bon Ton street and their host OT
friends in this city and Northwest Mis
souri wish them uninterrupted happi
ness and success in the new, yet so
old, everlasting bonds of Hymen's
weaving.
We Give It Up Why?
Why is it, a careless seven-year-old
kid can drop a half burned match in
an alley and burn up all the barns In
a block, while an able bodied man
has to use up a whole box of matches
to get a wood fire started In a heater
that has draft enough to draw air the
furniture up the stove pipe? Worth

SEVEN IN HELO
S
And OUT Own Champ Clark
Was a Witness of the
Funny Battle
WAS SENT TO HIDE HIS
-PTUTDT r1TVDC TT"kT OVO
And Became So Much Interested in
Taking Note of the Fight Between
the Home Guards and Morgan's Men
That He Came Very Nearly Being
Captured and His Horse Herd De
voted to the Use of the Southern
Cavalry.
When Missouri's own Champ Clark
spoke here last October, no one would
have drawn an idea from looking at
him that he had a military career, yet
such Is the case, and what he partici
pated in (really as a most interested
spectator) was one of the famous side
light of the war, for it had to deal
with the great Confederate raider.
History of the Civil war records
very few defeats for the Confederate
cavalry led by General Morgan, and
variously Known as ".Morgans .Men,"
"Morgan's Raiders," and other titles.
And yet seven of the Kentucky home
guards once succeeded in at least get
ting a drawn decision with the famous
mounted force.
A witness to this rather remark-,
able incident of the war between the
North and the South was Champ
Clark, then a boy working on a farm
,, , .,, ,. ,
near Mackville. Ky., now Missouri s
great Democrat and speaker of the
national houe of representatives.
Sent to Hide the Horses
The farmer for whom the speaker
was then working heard a rumor that
.. . . , . .,...,, ,.!'
Morgan and his force ere moving
rapidly in his direction. Knowing that
the Confederate cavalry moved with
great speed, using up horses as they
went along and being forced to levy
on the country for new mounts, the
farmer detailed oung Clark to take
some of the finer horses that he
owned and hide them in the woods.
The boy gathered up the small herd,
mounted one of them, and was about
to carry out his instructions when
coming over the brow of a distant hill
he saw the advance guard of the fa
mous cavalry. At that time he had
never seen a body of mounted troops
in war time, and the sun, glistening
on their sabers and equipment, held
him spellbound. Instead of carrying
out the farmer's instructions, young
Clark sat and gazed his full at the
Inspiring sight, forgetting that the
horses he had with him were the
most precious thing in the world to
the approaching soldiers and that he
had been told to hide them deep in
the woods.
Out Came Seven Men
While he watched, a bod of seven
"Home Guards" of Kentucky dashed
out of the woods and straight at the
advance guard of the Southern cav
alry. In close formation they charged
directly into the opposing cavalry1,
withholding their fire until they were
within easy pistol shot, then firing a
volley, which was returned immedi
ately. One man on each side was wounded.
In passing, the wounded "Home
Guard" was picked off his horse by
one of Morgan's men, and the wound
ed Confederate cavalryman was like
wise snatched from his horse by one
of the seven who were charging, while
he was in the very act of falling from
his horse.
Then Clark Got Busy
The valiant seven then turned and
rushed back into the woods. Then
young Clark realized what he must
do, and took his small herd of horses
to safety in the depths of the woods.
As he went he could hear orders being
given by Morgan's commanders, de
ploying his force in fighting forma
tion, under the impression that they
had encountered merely an advance
guard of a large force of northern
cavalry.
The Southern cavalry remained in
the vicinity until the next day, when
one of the seven home guardsmen
appeared with a flag of truce, and of
fered to exchange prisoners. Still be
lieving that he was threatened by a
large force of enemy cavalry, General
Morgan consented to this, and the two
wounded men were returned to their
comrades. It was some time after
this before the noted Southern leader
MO
realized that the whole force opposed
to him had been the seven men who
engaged in the charge. He had fig
ured that no one would be foolhardy
enough to engage bis large force with
such pitiful numbers, and the sheer
courage of the handful of men en
abled them to carry off the day with
honors at least evenly divided.
ROSS FOR PRESIDENT
A Livery Stable Keeper Who Polled
Quite a Vote In the Ne-
braska Primary
They have some freaks in Nebraska
as well as in Kansas and, by the
way, the Nebraska freaks are some
what of an Improvement over those
of the long-haired species in the Sun
flower state.
A Nebraska freak is Robert Ross of
Lexington, who makes an honest liv
ing by running a livery stable at that
place. Four years ago, and again this
year, he filed as a candidate for the
nomination for president of the United
States on both the Republican and
Democratic tickets. His vote this year
was nearly 20,000, being about equally
divided from both the Republican and
Democratic columns.
A citizen of Wayne, Neb., noting the
extent of the Ross vote, wrote to Mr
Ross, shortly after the primaries, in
the hope of learning something as to
his views on public questions and his
iiiiiijHHK anu i uaiuicauons lor the nr.

ing letter:

FIFTY YEARS AGO
Occurred the Inception of the Great
Retail Establishment r Town
send, Wyatt &. v '
Fifty years is a long time and
when jou look back, providing of
course that you are old enough to do
so, it Is not so long but yet is a long
time, all things considered, when you
come to look at It. in the conduct of
a mercantile establishment, and dur
ing all of which time jou have man
aged to please the people and dis
closed that you have done a square
and honorable and upright business
and have through this character of
work made a success.
And that is exactly what John
Townsend, the head and founder of
the great retail dry goods establish
ment of Townsend, Wyatt & Wall, has
done and this week he is celebrat
ing the golden anniversary of the es
tablishment of a house which is known
from ocean to ocean as one of the
greatest, and best, and most trust
worthy, of the retail dry goods houses
of the United States. This assertion
Is made advisedly for the business
career of the house bears it out. From
a small beginning the great retail
house of Townsend, Wyatt i- Wall,
through the business sagacity and
square dealing of its founder and his
associates, has now grown to be one
of the greatest in the West and all
through the fact that when the Town
send, Wyatt & Wall label or brand
appears on any article it is just what
it is represented to be and the people
know It.
SHOULD EXERCISE PROPER
CAUTION
It is rumored about the city
that on Monday night the St. Jo-
seph school board proposes to
make some radical changes in
various departments. The St. Jo-
seph school board should take
Into consideration the fact that
it is the servant of the St. Jo-
seph school district not its mas-
ters and If politics or personal
reasons govern Its actions the
people who pay the bills will
properly ask the reason.
