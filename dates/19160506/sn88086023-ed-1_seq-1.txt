Augustus F. Hill Was
Original Settler at
Pilot Rock Junction
It is now contended that If the ral'
road wished to honor tne name of the
original settler at the site of Pilot
P.ock junction the place should have
been culled Hill rather than Rleth.
This because the Rleth place was be
low the junction whereas the land at
the Junction is part of the original
homestead of Augustus F Hill, now
deceased and burled In the old north
Mde cemetery.
Mrs. Fred Hill, bookkeeper at the
McLean Auto Co., has the data on
the subject of when the Hill homestead
was taken. It was on 1858. the same
year in which the father of William
Daniels homesteaded the Daniels
place. The Rieths arrived in 1862 and
settled farther west.
Augustus F. Hill died 29 years ago
after having made his home continu
ously on the old homestead. The old
family home burned anout 13 years
ago.

SAN ANTONIO, Mexico, May 6.
A detachment of the Eleventh caval
ry under Major General Howse, killed
43 VUli8Uts in a fight yesterday at
OJoaxules, Howse reported to Per
shing. ' There were no casualties am
OSg the Americans The Mexican sur
vivors scattered. Howse described the
Villlstas as a large force under Gen
erals Dominguez and Acosta. He did
not estimate the number of Mexicans
wounded.
The battle followed an all night
march and was an early attack. Se
vere fighting ended only when the
Mexicans fled to the mountains. Howse
had trailed the bandits since Wednes
day and surprised them. They were
the remainder of the force that Dodd
routed at Tomaschlc and had reas
sembled sooner than was believed pos
sible. Their rout was complete. It
was not believed they would be able
to gather again for several weeks.
WASHINGTON, May 6. The war
department confirmed the reports ot
Howse's fight with Vlllistas. The
band attacked some Caranzlstas the
night before. Shortly afterwards the
Americans took the trail and surpris
ed the bandits in the mountains. Be
sides the killed, several were captur
ed. Seventy-five ponies and mules
were taken. Five Carranzista prls
noers whom the Vlllistas doomed to
be shot were released. In announc
ing the official report the department
emphasized this act as showing the
cooperation with the Carranzistas.

EL PASO, May 6. Scott was ex

entered into with Obregon covering
operations of the troops in Mexico
Whatever obstacles prevented Ogregon
from signing yesterday were believed
to be overcome today. It was expect
ed they would meet for the last con
ference without hesitation.
It was reliably reported that Scott
had sent O. P. Brown, an agent for
the war department, to Juarez before
the first conference for the purpose of
aweing the Mexicans. Brown failed
to find Obregon so conferred with
flavira and Garcia. He communicat
ed a warning that the United States
would not tolerate anarchy and that
If the Mexicans continued an attitude
of assertiveness and defiance the next
two years would be blacker than 184$

conference, issuing a virtual ultima-

WASHINCTON. May . The sub
marine issue has been closed. Wilson's
advisers believed. The white bouse
would not comment.
Officials In touch with the situation
considered that the issue Is so com
pletely closed that the president will
not reply. Lansing may issue a
statement calling attention to the es
sential point that Germany has order
ed submarine activities confined to
warships, f
It was believed that the issue would
remain closed and that Germany
would not reopen it by resuming Its
undersea warfare against merchant
men. Officials saw danger only In
the fact that submarine commanders
perhaps would be difficult to control.
The official text of the reply has
been received. Wilson is formulating
his decision. The conference between
the kaiser and Uerard suddenly
loomed large. It was never believed
that the details of the submarine Is
sue had been seriously discussed at
this conference. Since the arrival of
the reply it was strongly believed
here that peace talk was the promi
nent part of the conference. Several
persons near the president believed
that he should tentatively approach
the belligerents on the question of a
possible peace.
A high official said: "This note Is
not the voice of a braggart or a bully
It Is the voice of a nation sick and
tired of the endless fight. It la tha
heart and soul of Germany speaking
what It feels."
Monslgnor Bonzano left a message
at the White House regarding an ac
tion the president might take toward
securing peace.
