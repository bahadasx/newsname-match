Ofcregon and General Venustiano Car
ranza over the tentative agreement

in the scattering of Viliista bandits
have been completed, it was said to
nieht. It is expected that General Obre

with General Hugh U Scott tomorrow

the agreement will then be drawn
up.
It has been the expectation of Gen

take place today. At the last mo

General Carranza still held to the,
Iirinion that the American troops
hould set a definite and early date
for withdrawal. It was said that a
l3ree part of today was spent by th.
Mexican officials here in convincing
the first chief that the tentative a

main.
It is asserted, however .that there
are still a few details not yet asent

these will have to be threshed out at

The only event of the day on th

which he sr.id that Villa had been lo

except that he said that Villa had
been located. The general gave no de
tails except that the American troops
were not a great ways from the spot
at which the bandit was supposed to
be. Ofcials here were inclined to
think that there was a chance that
the expeditionary commander might
soon p't in touch with Villa bands.
Simultaneously with the receipt ol
General Pershing's mer.sage came a
report to Juarez that Villa had been
peen at Santiago rRnasqu'aro, in the
pta'e of Puraneo. This is far south
.of any locality in which American

those which Germany has agreed to
abandon.
New York Sun.
It is no more than fair to keep in
mind the circumstances that in order
to be effective, this deliberate move
of the imperial government for the
preservation of friendly relations
might take account of divided opinion
in Germany. The note had to be
written not only as a reply to a speci
fic demand of the American govern
ment, but also with a 'view to the
satisfaction to the national pride, a
very exacting natural sentiment at
home.
The tone is manifestly intended for
Berlin, the substance for Washington.
The administration may well con
centrate its attention on the essen
tial fact and that fact an immeasur

avoided without the obligation Vf a

New York Herald.
There are two things that he
(President Wilson) can do. One is
to sever diplomatic relations with
Germany immediately. The tone of
the note in its self would be justifica
tion for that. On the other hand he
can sit down and wait. He will not
have to wait long. There is r.'j way
out of the difficulties of the Cnited
States with Germany except Germany
abandoning its illegal use of the sub
marine. This it will not do. The
break seems bound to come in the
very nature of things. It Wjnld per
haps be better to have it come now.

finitely if it has not averted a di
plomatic break with the I'nited
States. President Wilson will
make the decision when he has
read the official text. It win uw
decoded In time to lay it before
the President tomorrow morning.
Jt was stated authoritatievly at
ter the cabinet meeting today
that if official text bore out the
unofficial version transmitted to
day in Berlin's news dispatch.
Germany's assurances undoubted
ly would be accepted and Deiore j
taking another "step the I'nited
States would wait the fulfillment j
of her latest promises. i
In such case, the United state
might not reply to the note aim
would await evidence of th- ac
tual abandonment of Germany's
present practices of submarine
warfare which is declared. Pres
ident Wilson is described by
those close about him as being in
a position where he cannot ques
tion the good faith of Germany's
commanders. The German em
bassv's view Is that the note gives
all President Wilson asked tor;
that it signalizes a return to
"cruiser warfare the use of
submarine as a regular naval
cruisers intercepting commerce !
with visit and search, and that in
as much as It makes no mention
of the armed ship question that
" perplexing feature of the contro
versy is not introduced.
The general sentiment in Con- j
gress seemed to b in favor of J
leaving the matter in the hands j
of the President. t
Cabinet members went over the un-1
official text carefully with the Presi- j
dent and while they uniformly re
fused to discuss it. they reflected the
view that a break had been averted
and that Germany's new assurances
would be accorded the test of time;
notwithstanding the reference to the
action Germany expects the Vnileo
States to take against Great Britain's;
treKfralnt on neutral trade. They
express this view wtih full realiza- :
tion of the differences of opinion on
what constitutes a peaceful merchant
ship, entitled to the protection ot in :
ternational law and of the President's '.
steadfast determination not to per
mit the interests of the Cnited States
wiih one of the belligerents td be- J
come confused with those of the oth-1
ers. I
Germany in her note reserves "com- '
plete liberty of decision.' should the,
I'nited States fail to prevail upon !
Great Britain to bring her practices
into conformity with international
l-iw. The official view is that the i
Cnited States for some time has been i
and is now conducting diplomatic ,
correspondence with Great Britain on ;
that subject and t"he success or fail- j
ure of the negotiation and Germany's i
'consequent action must necessarily
remain for the future.
The Cnited States does not know ;
how Germany's new instructions to
submarine comtianders compare with
previous instructions which were gi- ,
en at the behest of President Wilson. '
Secretary l.snsinc stated today that '
it was possible the State Department .
might ask for official copies of the;
old orders. I
The newest orders, however, are'
apparently rcearded as meeting the.
President's demand for a declaration !
of an abandonment of the present j
practices of submarine warfare. Offl-'
cials seem agreed that the Presi
dent's demnnd that Germany also
"effect" such an abandonment only
could answer by time. j
T'nder tich circumstances one- st
of offirisls feel ths' the threatened'
hrek 'ill not cowe at this time: j
anotber set is convinced that Ger
many's apparent determination to
make the fulfillment of her promises,
contingent upon negotiations with
Great Britain warrants the severance)
of relations.
At the state department after the
fiiuation, had been thoroughly dis
cussed nt the cabinet meeting, it was
stated that because of the leneth of
the note, the time required for di
gesting it carefully and the necessity
of having at hand tbe official text for
!the preservation! of all shades of
meanins which might be obscured in
translation or in wireless transmis
sion, it practically was certain that
the President would not reach his de
cision before next week.
Out of it two things were made
clear. They were that the Cnited
States still hold firmly to n deter
mination that "niistakes" of subma
rine commanders are not admissible:
that they are unforgivable and that
the I'nited States must continue ti
regard a'.iscussion of the conduct of
other belligerents as irrelevant to its
discussion of Germany's conduct.
While the tone of the German note
was said to be disappointing, mosi.
officials expressed the view that arte
all the language was immaterial if
the assurances were all that had been
asked for. .
At the end of the cabinet meetm
the president asked all of the mem
bers present to read the German no?
"arr:fu;y. The president remained
in his study all day and examined the
German note very carefully. Tonight
he read editorial comments from alt
parts of the country.

"In connection with the ease of the
