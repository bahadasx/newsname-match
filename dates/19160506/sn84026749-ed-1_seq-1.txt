Berlin Fails to Meet
Demand, London View
LONDON, May 6. Washing--ton
dispatches, reporting
President Wilson probably
will accept the German re
ply, brought .disappointment
to the London presi today.
The morning newspapers
agreed almost unanimously
that Germany had failed to
meet the American de
mands; that a diplomatic
break was inevitable; and
that shortly the United
States would be r'anged be
side the allies in the wui.
The English newspapers ex
pressed concern, too, over
Germany's attempt to em
broil Great Britain and
America.
The only paragraph that
brought satisfaction to Lon
don was Germany's declara
tion that her concessions
were made to prevent the
prolongation of the war.
London critics seized upon
this as an admission that
Germany is seriously alarm
ed over the effect of Ameri
ca's entrance into the war o.i
the side of the allies.

Wilson Will Pay No Attention to

MUCH OPTIMISM FELT HERE
Officials Think Reference to
Hope That War Will End
Was Dictated By Kaiser.
President Wilson is declared on
good authority to have practically
made up his mind to accept Ger
many's1 note at its face value.
Regarding the new orders to
submarine commanders as consti
tuting a compliance with his de
mand that Germany shall "de
clare" an abandonment of hsr
present methods of .submarine
warfare, the President, it is said,
will accept them as such; and
await developments to prove
whether she has also "effected"
an abandonment.
Whether the attitude of the
American Government will be
made known in a new note, or by
an official statement on the part
of Secretary Lansing has not been
finally determined. The chances
favor the former method.
SEE PEACE HOPE.
Contributing considerably to the com
plalsant attltudo of tho Administration,
it developed today. Is tho growing belief
In the minds of tho President's advisers
that tho references in the note to Ger
many's desire for peace, and her un
willingness to prolong the war. contain
a hint of Rerlln's willingness to accept
tresh offers of mediation from Presi
dent Wilson.
And Just as it has been the hope of
President Wilson ever since tho war be
gan that he might servo as tho Instru
mentality whereby the world war might
bo brought to an end. he has Mn.i.i.
ently endeavored, his advisers say, to

trfo belligerents signify a willingness to

Coming as it did straight from the
Kaiser's headquarters on tho western
front, the note In Its references to
prospects for peace Is believed not only
to tcltec tho Kaiser's views but to
have been practically dictated by him.
t Emphasizes Seriousness.
Tho fact that the German censor today
