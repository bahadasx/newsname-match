OFFICIAL NEWS OF CITY AND COUNTY
The Sunshine Highway, from
Boundary, in Stevens county, to
Nogalez, Arizona, is the plan of
the Sunshine Highway Associa
tion to form a north-and-south
roadway which will connect six
states and pass through 28 coun
ties and 274 cities and towns.
Tn Washington it will follow
closely the Inland Empire high
way from Boundary to Lewiston,
and the Spokane county section is
nearly all paved or will be paved
within a few months. Passing
through Colville it will reach Spo
kane by way of Deer Park, Deni
son. Wayside and Dartford. On
the south it will pass through
Marshall. Spangle, Plaza and Ro
salia and directly to Lewiston.
From Lewiston the route will
lead to Grangeville and by way of
Weiser to Boise and on to Twin
Falls. It then will go south
through Nevada to Ely and south
west to Beaver in Utah. It will
swing back southwest to Las Ve
gas in Nevada and south to
Needles, Cal A swing to the
northeast will take the road to
Peach Springs in Arizona, south
east to Ashfork, south through
PreHCott and Phoenix and through
Tucson to Noagles on the Mexi
can border.
The road will cover 2,248 miles,
traversing six states and 28 coun
ties, touching two state capitals
and 20 county seats. The coun
ties traversed have a total popula
tion of 510,392. The Sunshine
highway has been approved by
the National Highway Association,
according to A. L. Westgard, vice
president and director of trans
continental highways.
Within the last few months
there has come to the west an in
crease in the price of a number of
manufactured articles, the in
crease being a direct result of the
influence of the European war,
and an indirect result of the tariff
policy which this country main
tained for a number of years,
increases have come in the prices
of articles manufactured from
metals, from certain cloths, from
nearly all dyestuffs and coloring
matter.
Hardware stores find that the
rising metal market has forced up
prices in the east, manufacturers
not only paying more for the raw
metals, but more wages to the
skilled men. Europe is using our
metals, and the munitions makers
can and do pay almost any price
asked for metals, skilled work
men, and for the other things
which are used in making guns,
shells, explosives, and war equip
ment.
The bottling up of Germany has
cut us off from our dyestuffs mar
ket. The extravagant prices
which munitions makers are will
ing to pay for the chemicals
which are used in making color
ing matter, cloth, paper, etc., pre
vent our own country from mak
ing a sufficient quality and quan
tity of coloring matter to supply
our demands. And the increase
in wages of skilled mechanics has
brought an increase in the price
of many manufactured articles.
Coloring matter and the chemi
cals used in the paper and cloth
factories are now either unobtain
able or so high priced that fac
tories are not trying to buy them.
When a munitions maker stands
ready to buy the entire output
of a chemical factory, and to pay
(J cents a pound for old rags,
there is little chance for paper
and textile mills to try to com
pete, for Europe will pay any
price for the munitions, while our
own people have a limit which
they will pay for manufactured
products.
The tariff bogey has been
Haunted in the faces of voters for
so many years that almost any
statement may be made as to
what it has done and what it haa
not done. But the old tariff pol
ley of this country did NOT build
up the American manufacture of
Coloring matter, or of the acids
which are used in many lines of
paper and textile manufacture,
hence today we pay the penalty
in increased prices. The tariff
DID permit eastern manufactur
ers to reap enormous profits on
manufactured articles, because
their competitors were shut out,
but these same manufacturers
bought their chemicals and dye
.stulVs from Germany and contin
ued to buy them there because
they could buy cheap. They in
sisted on being protected in what
they sold, but wanted low prices
on what they bought. Therefore
they waxed rich.
The European war, and the
pcarcity of ships, have acted as a
high protective tariff wall to this
country. When goods can not be
brought here at any price, it is
the same as a high protective
tariff, And when Germany ceas
ed shipping dyestuffs here, the
prices soared from 10 per cent to
1.000 per cent. The people pay
this.
When the present congress, for
purpose of fevenue, voted to re
tain the last remnant of the tariff
on sugar, look how the sugar
price went up And the consum
ers pay for it. Every time a
tariff wall is erected, the common
people pay the difference.
The present increase in prices
of commodities is partly from ab
normal war conditions, and partly
finiii tlir deficiencies of the old
republican high tariff. War al
ways overturns business stand
aids, which is one reason why
president Wilson has not wanted
this nation to get into any more
trouble than the war has already
brought to us.
The tariff manipulations of the
republican party are responsible
for a part of the present increase.
Only such industries were created
under the high tariff as best con
served the pocketbooks of the
tariff people, and the articles
which could be bought cheaper in
Germany than they could make
them here were steadily bought
from Europe and then retailed by
our manufacturers at the high
prices they were able to get under
the tariffs which "protected"
their manufactured articles.
The last two years have dem
onstrated the need of a tariff com
mission which shall be non-parti
san and not especially favorable
to any one set of men. Then a
war condition may be met. Or in
a period of peace, home industry
may be created. But a high re
publican tariff made for the ben
efit of Wall street and its friends
is always paid for by the people.
We are paying it now.
That the inhabitants of the
mountain regions of Stevens coun
ty are vicing with those of the
Allegheny hills of Virginia and
Carolina, in the illicit manufac
ture of alcoholic spirits was em
phasized last week when D. W.
Porter, a farmer and by reputa
tion a leading citizen of the Ar
zina district, 20 miles west of Col
ville, was taken in custody by C.
B, Montague a special agent in
the U. S. revenue service with
headquarters at Portland. Porter
was charged with having in his
possession a quantity of alcoholic
liquor upon which had not been
paid the required government
revenue. When arraigned before
IT. 8. circuit court commissioner
Kathrine S. Ide, the defendant,
who is a one-armed man, waived
■xamiuatioii und was placed under
+ 1,000 bail to await the action of
the I. S. grainl jury at Spokane,
in default of which he was taken
to Spokane by deputy U. K. mar
tial Fred Thorp.

Hows in crystal streams out to the
farms that skirt the range and
sweep out to the Columbia river,
forming an ideal retreat for the
moonshiner. Porter hails from
the Appalachian range where, it
is said, his ancestors were engaged
in the distillery business. It was
at the opening of one of these can
yons that Porter owned a ranch
of 160 acres. A cedar swamp
formed part of his holdings. To
get to Porter's place numerous
houses along the country road oc
cupied by friends of Porter had
to be passed and the telephone
could spread the alarm in the
event of an intruding stranger.
Montague, being alert to the dan
gers of an expedition of this sort,
secured deputy sheriff Bryant for
a guide and approached the
neighborhood by automobile.
They met Porter on horseback en
route to town for his weekly sup
plies. Thep stopped to inquire of
him the way to a settler's place
far out of the range of their pur
posed destination. Porter very
obligingly directed them and saw
that they did not take the wrong
rood, thus being thrown complete
ly off his guard. When they
reached a convenient place they
shunted their auto into ili<' brush
and the two officers took to the
summit of the range remote from
the settlements, following moun
tain paths, scaling precipitous
bluffs and hazarding the heights
until they reached the spring at
the source of the stream which
opens to the valley at Porter's
house.
Following the stream through
an almost impassable thicket, the
snow still hanging in the deep
chasm, they struck a trail which
terminated at a rounded stone
furnace, the type used in the il
licit business. It had been recent
ly used but the kettle and the
worm had been removed. Con
tinuing to the swamp they found
,-i trail leading from the house to
the timber. This they followed
a few hundred feet to another
furnace similar to the first one
but the kettle and worm had been
removed from this too. Though
no roof covered either still, an ex
amination of the ground disclosed
a cache of a considerable quantity
of genuine corn whisky. At the
house a ten gallon keg contained
four gallons of whisky identical
with that found at, the still. The
two outfits were confiscated and
the li«|uor taken in charge to be
used as evidence. On the return
trip they met Porter, formally
placed him under arrest, and
brought him to the county jail at
Colville.
Tt is not known how extensively
the "moonshine" was distributed,
but it is claimed that fully a dozen
places in as many neighboring
towns have been supplied regular
ly with intoxicants, the product
even reaching Spokane. The still,
so local officers say, has been in
operation to their knowledge for
about five years without exciting
public attention. A number of
neighbors are under suspicion as
having had an active interest in
the whisky manufactured by Por
ter. It is said that there are many
families in the cummunity who
came from Porter's home in the
east.
