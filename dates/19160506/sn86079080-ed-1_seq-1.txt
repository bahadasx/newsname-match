In the death of G. Adolph
Gondran which occurred in New
Orleans Friday morning of last
week, the state of Louisiana has
has been deprived of a valued citi
ean, and many persons in this
community have losta true friend
For the greater part of his life
a resident of Donaldsonville, Mr.
Gondran was regarded as one of
the town's must progressive and
public-spirted citizens, for there
was no department of human
activity that did not interest him
and much to which he gave person
at service. He was universally
esteemed and admired, and the
news of his passing was nowhere
received with deeper sorrow or
more lastine regret than among
his friends and former follow
tbwnsmen here.
We extract the following sketch
of Mr. Gondran's life from the
New Orleans Times-Picayune of
last Saturday:
"G. Adolph Gondran was born
in Donaldsonville fifty-six years
ago, the scion of a promiuent
Creole family. He was prepared
for college in the schools of his
native town, and soon after reach
Itg manhood he entered Tulane
Unlversity, where he was gradu
ated in law and returned to
Doaldsnnvile to practice.
Pop lar in his native parish, and
bavlng the entire confidence of
*e people who bad known him I
-dl his life, he was elected district
attorney in 1898 and held that '
poitloa for twelve years.
He made an enviable reputation a
as a pleader and as a criminal
lawyer, and in 1910 Judge Guion
who had been elected attorney
. Ima, selected him as the
.gistant to whom the criminal
btrach of the offioeshould be en b
- 'He served as an assistant dur`
g tAtl term with Colonel Plea
t. 'i and when that gentleman
Wiaselected attorney general he
oamtawed Mr. Gouaran in the
ame. Meantime the duties of the
eles had been greatly increased
,dAbe assistant in the crimiDnl
Niasah was required to conduct
al dle appeals of criminal cases
btir.rthe supreme court. The re
eeSo of the courts show with
what 4ideity sadi.ltty he per.

I
I"In the deceased the state has
lost a valuable servitor, and onn
it cannot replace at the present
salary of the office. A close
student, with a retentive memo.
he had the criminal laws of the
state and the country at his
finger tips, and was in posses
sion of facts at the beginning of a
case that the average lawyer
would have to obtain by research
occupying much time, Hence it
was that Mr. Gondran in the past
year had been able to present to
t he supreme court and other
tribunals two hundred briefs,
some of them in very
important cases His legal judg
ment was sound, and he was
generally successful in his plead
ing. He conducted the criminal
branch of the state's business at
a salary entirely inadequate to
the work performed because he
desired to live in New Orleans
that his children could have the
educational advantcges they
could not obtain in his old home.
"Funeral services were con
ducted over the remains of Mr.
Gndran at the family residence,
4925 Dryades street, Friday evE
ning. Saturday morning the
body was taken to Donaldson
ville where interment was made"

d
f The Washington Evening Star
. an independent newspaper
t makes the following comment oni
sugar and the ouisiana election:
"Sugar continues on the duti- j
able list without time limit. The
senate surrendered to the house. ]
The controversy was brief-so
brief-so soon done for, one is
' tempted to wonder what it was _
begun for.
S"The result will still further .
hearten those Louisiana Demo
crats who at the polls last week [
r stood by their party and elected t
- its state ticket in the face of the
national administration's atti
Srtude toward sugar. A combina
[ tion of Bull Moosers, Republican
=and protection Democrats nomi
- nated and supported an opposi
tion ticket, but could not land it.
Even with his free sugar fault,
the Democratic organization
stood by the president.
I"Whether there *ould have
been a ditferent result, the sur
render by the house to the senate a
giving sugar only four years more it
of grace, if Louisiana had voted p
against the Democracy is but
oobjecture. But the subject is
such as to invite conjecture and
conjecture produces several dit- ti
ferent opinions.
' Something more tangible and it
definite relates to what the re-'
suit promises the sugar industry s

usual number of bills did not fail
3' to make 1 heir appearance and
kept our Parish Fathers quite
s busy during the morning session.
Mr. L. E. Perrin, an agent of
