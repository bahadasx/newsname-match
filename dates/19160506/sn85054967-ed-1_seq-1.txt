WASHINGTON, May 4.—Germany's reply to the de
mand of the United States for immediate abandonment of
prese nt metliods of submarine warfare,delivered to Ambas
sador Gerard today, was awaited by otiicials of the Washing
ton government toniglit with expectant tension. They were
without any definitive idea of what the comunication
contained. A brief message from Ambassador Gerard as well
as press reports, however, had created the impression tliat
the imperiai government would propese conditions which
the United States could not accept.
It was reiterated that President Wilson stood unalterably
bv the position declared in the note to Germany—that the
abandonment of present submarine methods must be declar
ed and effected immediately, or the United States must sev
er diplomatic relations. This demand was designed to per
mit of no argument, and high officials repeatedly liave as
serted that anything short of a literal complince would be
followed by a diplomatic rupture.

Man and Wife Are
Cbarged witli the
Murder of a Winer
Following an inquest eonducted
by Coroner H. B. Buterbaugh
last evening into the murder of
Sani Rosso, who was fatally shot
at Nowrytown, near Iselin, Tues
day evening, Mr. and Mrs.
Frank Borgi were lield to ans
wer for the crime at the
next terni of criminal court.
The couple made a statement
to Sheriff Harry A. Boggs, in
which they declared that Rosso
had been paying attentions to
Mrs. Boigi and that the husband
was jealous. They talked the
matter over and decided that
the surest way of ending the
difficulty was to kill Rosso.
Following the shooting, the
Borgis fled to Saltsburg on an
early train. They were captured
there and returned to Indiana
I
Tuesday afternoon.
Rosso is a miner and formerly
resided with the Borgis.
Mr. and Mrs. Borgi are said to
have hired an automobile and
gone to Iselin, where Rosso
worked in the mines. They wait
ed until he had returned from
his work, as they knew that Ros
so must pass that way to getto
his home . Shortly before 6 o'-
clock he quit work and started
to his boarding house. When he
got within a short distance of
Borgi and his wife both opened
fire upon him simultaneously.
Both Borgi and his wife, it is
maintained, emptied their re
volvera and four of the 10 shots
flred took effect, two entering
Rosso's breast, while two struck
him in the back.
Throwing away their revolvera
they ran through the town and
out the road towards Saltsburg.
A short distance from lselin
they overtook George Hart, of
Saltsburg, who was driving in
the direction they were preceed
ing. They asked him for a ride,
and with him drove to a point
A short distance from lselin
where they met Miller, who was
returning from Narrytown.They
got into his auto and drove to
their home at Narrytown, sec
ured their 2 children and drove
to Blairsville, evidently with the
intention of taking the 7 o'clock
train out of that place for Pitts
-1 burgh. They missed that train,
but bojyded another shortly be
fore 2 o'clock.
Sheriff Boggs, of this place
had learned of the movements
of the fugitives and he tele
: phoned to the constable at Salts
burg, who boarded the train
when it stopped at Saltsburg and
placed the two under arrest.
Sheriff Boggs went to Saltsburg
Tuesday morning and returned
about 4 o'clock with his prison
ers.
The dead man was single.
