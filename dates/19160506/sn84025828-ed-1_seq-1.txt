headquarters in tho Otis building.
After tho delegates had arrived at tho
La Sallo, tho sixth placo, allotted to

TOO MANY FOSSILS
Chicago Postoffice Is Loaded
Down With Them New Blood
Is Needed,
.The .Chicago postofllce has long
been a Joke among' the postofllcos of
the country. There Is too much dead
timber among Its superintendents.
Now blood Is needed to Insure et-
flclcncy and tho fact that many of
tho superintendents are nover missed
when away from their Jobs shows
that subordinates aro doing the work.
A change Is necessary. '
The ncrvo of the Chicago official In
disregarding tho law regarding
changes of address by newspaper or
periodical subscribers, Is tho limit.
Instead of following this law tho
Chicago postofllce simply rubber
stamps tho mall: "Notify publisher
of change of address."
It the subscriber is too busy mov

The three worst offenders among
local postal stations are Station M,
Edgowator, and Garfield Park.
Tho now postmaster should make
some changes for the good of tbe
service.
Progressives are up In arms over
the personnel of the Republican Judi
cial ticket nominated on Monday.
POST OFFICE FOSSILS
Grand Round-up of Superinten
dents Whose Total Service at
the Public Crib Aggregates
Over 500 Years.
"A thousand years my own Colum
bia," was the principal song at the
dinner to Chicago Post Ofllco Superin
tendents given by Postmaster Camp
bell on Monday. It was a delicate
tribute to the tenacity of tho National
payroll, If not to tho cfllctency of the
service. It was announced that fif
teen of the superintendents hnd been
on tho payroll over 27 years and that
the length of service of some of them
was far greater. THo eaters present
represented a total payroll of over
500 years. All word Republicans, of
course, as Democrats do not get a
chance to last that long In public life.
