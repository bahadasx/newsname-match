Unofficial Text of Note Is
Viewed With Alarm at
National Capital
Washington, May 5.
While final decision on the
attitude of the American
government awaits receipt
of the official text, somev
cabinet members indicated
that the German assur
ances probably would be
accepted and that diplo
matic relations would not
be broken unless the order
to submarine commanders
was violated and American
lives endangered.
The cabinet was in ses
sion two hours and a half
the longest meeting held
for several months.
As the cabinet members
left the white house, sev
eral indicated their view
that, the United States
would have to wait and see
whether the new orders to
submarine commanders
were carried out
Washington*1!*! O., Jifay 8—President
Wilson and the d&blnet went carefully
oyer the German note as transmitted
In news dispatches from Berlin.
A first feeling that It was unsatis
factory was somewhat leavened by the
text of the new orders to submarine
commanderB, although It' was fore
seen that the reference to Immunity
for "merchant ships recognised by In
ternational law" might admit of some
dispute of Interpretation.
So much depends upon words and
their phases of meaning involved In
translation from German to English
that no decision can be attempted un
til the offlolal text is In the presi
dent's hands. It ought to be In Wash
ington tonight.
Two views were current in official
circles. One was that Qermany has
declared her intention of abandoning
her "present methods of submarine
warfare" as demanded by the presi
dent.
The other was that the United
States, having already attempted to
have Great Britain give up its Inter
ference with neutral commerce and
having told Germany that It can not
discuss with her its negotiations with
Great Britain, has no course but to
break diplomatic relations with Ger
many.
While the general tone of the Ger
man note created an unfavorable im
pression, officials took the position
that the language was immaterial If
the guarantees were real.
The refusal of the German govern
ment to openly admit the attack on
the Sussex was considered only inci
dental to the main issue.
Until President Wilson himself de
cides whether the German note is ac
ceptable, there will be no announce
ment of the attitude of the govern
ment.
Congress received the note quietly
with members expressing a variety of
views. Senators of the foreign rela
tions committee uniformly refrained
from comment. Others thought the
reply favorable, some were doubtful
of the conditions apparently attached
and some others thought it has not
advanced the negotiations toward set
tlement at all. On the surface there
were no Indications of activity in the
group which has opposed the presi
dent's policy of pressing his demands.
May Ask to See Orders.
Later Secretary Lansing said it was
possible that the United States might
ask Gerjnany for an official copy of
the previous orders to submarine com
manders, which never have been com
municated to the state department, so
that Jhey might be compared with the
new orders described in the note.

Germany's Note
Berlin, May 5 —Following is the text
of the note of the German government
in reply to the American note respect
ing submarine warfare, delivered on
Thursday by Gottlieb von Jagow, the
foreign secretary, to Ambassador Ge
rard:
"The undersigned, on behalf of the
imperial German government, has the
honor to present to his excellency, the
ambassador of the United States, Mr.
James W. Gerard, the following reply
to the note of April 20 regarding the
conduct of German submarine war
fare.
"The German government handed
over to the proper naval authorities
for early investigation the evidence
concerning the Sussex as communicat
ed by the government of. the United
States. Judging by the results that
the investigation has hitherto yielded,
the German government Is alive to the
possibility that the ship mentioned in
the note of April 10 as having been
'torpedoed by a German submarine :s
actually identical with the Sussex.
"The German government begs to
reserve further communication on the
matter until certain points are ascer
tained, which are of decisive impor
tance for establishing the facts of the
case. Should it turn out that the com
mander was wrong in assuming the
vessel to be a man of war, the German
government will not fail to draw the
consequence resulting therefrom.
'In conectlon with the case of the
Sussex, the government of the United
States made a series of statements, the
gist of which is the assertion that the
incident is to be considered but one
Instance of a deliberate method of in
discriminate destruction of vessels of
all sorts, nationalities and destinations
by German submarine commanders.
NOT MANY VIOLATIONS.
'The German government must em
phatically repudiate the assertion. The
German government, however, thinks
it of little avail to enter Into details
in the present stage of affairs, more
particularly as the government of the
United States omitted to substantiate
the assertion toy reference to concrete
facts.
"The German government will only
state that it has imposed far reaching
restraints upon the use of the submar
ine weapon, solely in consideration of
neutrals' interests, in spite of the fact
that these restrictions are necessarily
of advantage to Germany's enemies.
No such consideration has ever been
shown neutrals by Great Britain and
her allies.
"The German submarine forces have
had, in fact, orders to conduct the sub
marine warfare in accordance with the
general principles of visit and search
and the destruction of merchant ves
sels recognized by international law,
the sole exception being the conduct
of warfare against enemj^ trade car
ried on enemy freight ships encounter
ed in the war zone surrounding Great
Britain. With regard to these, no as
surances have ever been given to the
government of the United States. No
such assurances are contained in the
declaration of February 8, 1916.
"The German government cannot
armit any doubt that these orders
were given or are executed in good
faith. Errors actually occurred. They
can in no kind of warfare be avoided
altogether. Allowances must be made
In the conduct of naval warfare
against enemy resorting to all kindB
of ruses, whether permissible or Illicit.
DANGER FOR NEUTRALS.
"But apart from the possibility of
errors, naval warfare Just like war
fare on land, implies unavoidable
dangers for neutral persons and goods
entering the fighting zone. Even in
cases where the naval action is con
fined to ordinary forms of cruiser war
fare, neutral persons and goods re
peatedly come to grief.
"The German government has re
peatedly and explicitly pointed out the
dangers from mines that have led to
the loss of numerous ships. .•
"The German government has made
several proposals to the government of
the United States in order to reduce to
a minimum for American travelers and
goods the inherent dangers of naval
warfare. Unfortunately, the govern
ment of the United States decided not
to accept the proposals. Had it ac»
cepted, the government of the United
States would have been instrumental
in preventing the greater part of the
accidents that American citizens have
met with In the meantime.
"The German government still
stands by its offer to come to an agree
ment along these lines.
"As the German government repeat
edly declared, it cannot dispense with
the use of the submarine weapon in
the conduct of warfare against enemy
trade. "The German government, how
ever, has now decided to make a
further concession, adapting methods
of submarine war to the interests of
neutrals.

GERMANY'S REPLY AVERTS
LINES FIXED BY
HE
Trouble Not Much Nearer
Solution Than It Was
Just a Year Ago
GERMAN PROMISES
NOT SATISFACTORY
U. S. Contending for Rights
of All Neutrals While
Raising Protests
Washington, D. C., May 6.—Ger
many's diplomatic correspondence with
the United States on the submarine
issue has extended over nearly a year.
All along President Wilson has spok
en primarily for the inviolable rights
of Americans and generally for the
rights of neutrals.
Submarine warfare did not actually
enter the realm of diplomacy until
the destruction of the Lusitania. The
accumulation of cases affecting Ameri
cans was taken up in the first note to
Germany which was dispatched May
15, 1916. It characterized the attacks
on the Falaba, Cushlng, Gulfiight and
Lusitania as a "series of events which
the United States has observed with
growing concern, distress and amaze
ment."
The note closed with these words:
"The imperial German government
will not expect the government of the
Uriited States to omit any word or
act necessary to the performance of
its sacred duty of maintaining the
rights of the United StateB and its
ettlsens and of safeguarding their free
exercise and enjoyment."
Reply Unsatisfactory.
May 28, 1915, Germany replied with
a note which was In every respect un
satisfactory. The note met none of
the contentions of the United States
so far as the Lusitania and Falaba
sinkings were concerned, although a
supplementary note later did acknowl
edge that Germany was wrong In the
attacks on the Cushlng and the Gul
fiight, expressed regret for those two
cases and promised to pay damages.
While the American reply to the
note was being framed, dissension In
the cabinet resulted In the resigna
tion of Secretary Bryan. He resigned
because he thought he could not sign
the next note to Germany, which he
feared would lead the United States
into war.
Secretary Lansing took office as Mr.
Bryan's successor and his reply to the
German note took issue with every
contention Germany had set up in the
Falaba and Lusitania cases, denied
flatly the contention that the' Lusi
tania was armed or was to be treated
as other than a peaceful merchant
ship and reminded Germany that It
was the duty of the United States "to
speak with solemn emphasis, to call
the attention of the imperial German
government to the grave responsibility
which the government of the United
States conceives that it has concurred
in this tragic occurrence and to the
indisputable principle upon which that
responsibility rests." The note aver
red that the declaration of a subma
rine war zone could not abbreviate
the rights of Americans on lawful
Journeys.
Appeal to People.
To that note Germany did not reply
until July 8 and the German rejoinder
was preponderated characterized by
American newspapers, not as a note,
but as an address by Foreign Minister
von Jagow to the American people. In
official circles it was said to come no
nearer to meeting the American con
tentions than did the former German
note.
The nature of the reply was regard
ed officially as convincing evidence
that Germany was holding the nego
tiations as a club over the United
States to force this government Into
some action to compel Great Britain
to relax the food blockade.
President Wilson steadfastly refus
ed to permit the diplomatic negotia
tions of the United States with one
belligerent to become entangled with
the relations with another.
To that the United States replied
on July 21 that the German note failed
to meet "the real differences between
the two governments." The United
States it declared, was "keenly dis
appointed" with Germany's attitude.
Submarine attacks without warning
endangering Americans and other neu
trals were characterized as "Illegal
and inhuman" and "manifestly inde
fensible." It declared that the United
States would continue td contend for
the freedom of the seas "from what
ever quarter violated, without com
promise and at any costs/',.

Perusal of German Note Causes Fears
Among the 8tock Traders In
Finance Center.
New York, May 5.—Wall street's
grave view of the German note was
reflected in the demoralized tone of
the stock market at the opening to
day, active Issues, particularly those
comprising the war group, breaking
three to six points, with nineteen for
Bethlehem Steel!
The tenor of the German reply was
generally known before the market
opened. There was a very large 'at
tendance of members on the floor of
the exchange and broker's offices
were crowded with apprehensive cus
tomers.
Brokers hid numerous selling orders
and the course of the market at the
opening denoted little support.

in hours and an increase in wages will
be asked.
DI0WM SUGGESTS
LE8LIE M. SHAW 8AY8 NATIONS
MU8T LEAGUE TOGETHER TO
ENFORCE LAWS.
New York, May 6. —A new world
government, that might be called the
United Sovereignties of the Earth,
with a constitution patterned some
what after that of the United States,
was suggested by Leslie M. Shaw, for
mer secretary of the treasury, in an
address before the world court league
at Carnegie hall here last night
No war In the last hundred years
has resulted from any justiciable
cause, said Mr. Shaw, and he referred
to the present relations between the
United States and Germany, the Jap
anese objections with regard to Cali
fornlan legislation, and other questions
that were outside of justiciable mat
ters. Thus far no plan had been for
mulated for the determination of non
justiciable causes, the world relying
only on the hope that some amicable
settlement could be reached in such
cases.
"Following the revolutionary war,"
Mr. Shaw said, "this country existed
for six years under articles of confed
eration, but they were more precar
ious than the preceding seven years of
war. Then, 'we, the people, for the
purpose of forming a more perfect
union' etc., adopted a constitution, and
for the first time insured peace be
tween states and rendered impossible
any non-justiciable causes of war. Un
der our constitution, It Is unthinkable
that any or the legislature of
New York could insult or outrage the
dignity of Pennsylvania. All justiciable
questions between the states can now
be determined In the courts.
"The only possible way that I see
by which a world court can be created
and clothed with adequate powers Is
in conjunction with the creation of a
new government. This new govern
ment can be given any appropriate
name, but I suggest the United States
Sovereignties of Earth. This would in
volve a constitution patterned as far
as practicable after the constitution of
the United States of America. Under
our constitution, each sovereign state
must be a republic, but under the pro
posed constitution, each sovereignty
composing the United Sovereignties
would have to be permitted to continue
its present form of government. It
would a*Iso require a congress, a chiet
executive under some name, a court, a
standing army and navy sufficient to
enforce the peace of the world and
each of the several sovereignties
would have to be limited in the size
of their respective army and navy the
same as each of our soverign states
are limited in the size of their national
guards and the number of their armed
ships.
"Many difficulties would arise and
perhaps the first and most serious
would be the necessity of securing
recognition of the Monroe doctrine and
the guaranty that the existing form ot
government of each of the sovereign
ties composing the United States Sov
ereignties should be continued.

Washington, D. C., May 5.—Indica
tions were today that representatives
of the United States and the Mexican
