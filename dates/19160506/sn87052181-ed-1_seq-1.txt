STATE OWES M. U. $86,000
President A. Ross Hill Believes Mis-
sourl Treasury la Bankrupt
Salaries Long Past Due.
Dr. A. Iloss 11111, president of the
Missouri stato university, told a re
porter nt St. Ixiuls that the stato treas
ury Is bankrupt and tho officials at
Jefferson City wero trying to conceal
tho fact.
Wo aro now about threo months
In arrears at the stato university in
tho payment of salarlos of tho facul
ty," said President Hill, "in all. wo
aro about $86,000 behind In tho pay
ment of expenses from tho general
revenuo fund. II. B. Price of Colum
bia, .treasurer of tho university, has
been paying our salary vouchers for
tho state and advancing tho juouoy on
his own account.
'Wo might as well admit tho fact.
Tho stato Is bankrupt nnd the offi
cials nt Jefferson City aro trying to
conceal it, desptto tho statement of
ono of tho candidates for governor nt
Columbia that tho state has sufficient
money to meet Its necessary expenses.
'Governor Major, somo time ngo,
asked us to curtail our expenditures
within a minimum fixed by him and
wo havo done so, but despite this, wo
havo not been nblo to get money for
tho university when due from the
Ktate. Tho vouchers nre not turned
down by tho stntc, but aro Just hold
up, that's all. Wo aro going along tho
best we can under tho circumstances,
hoping for tho best, but we do not
know what tho biennial period Is going
to show In the way of state finances."
President Hill said the presont ar
rangements for paying tho expenses
ot tho university mny not continue,
and tho federal government may cut
off tho funds appropriated for tho col-
lego of ngrlculturo becauso tho stato
has not paid its part.
MASONIC TREASURER DEAD
A. C. Stewart Stricken With Acute In
digestion While En Route to
Home In St. Louis.
Alphonso Chaso Stewart, thirty
three degree Mason, and treasurer ot
tho Missouri grand lodge, who was
stricken with acute indigestion on a
train coming from Kansas City, died
at St. Luke's hospital In St. Louis. He
was a son of Lieut. Gen. Alexander P.
Stewart ot tho Confederate army, and
as a cadet was attached to his fath
er's staff In tho war.
Mr. Stewart was born In Lebanon,
Tcun., August 27, 1848. In 1871 ho
was married to Miss Elizabeth Smith
of Winchester, Tenn. He Is survived
by his wife, a daughter, Mrs. Georgo
Williams, and son, Doctor S. Smith
Stewart, who wero at his bedside. Mr.
Stewart was counsel of tho St. Louis
Union Trust Company; member ot a
prominent law firm; a well known flg
uro In tho Cumberland Presbyterian
church, and wealthy. From 1904 to
1908 ho was president of tho St. Louis
pollco board.
No ono on tho. train recognized as
Mr. Stewart tho man who suddonly
lurched from his seat and fell uncon
scious to tho floor as tho train pulled
out of Hawk Point. Strangely, It was
Patrolman John S. Broyles, who was
appointed to tho force In 1909 by Mr.
Stewart, who recognized tho attorney
when tho train reached tho Union Sta
tion. Becauso of tho police rules,
Broyles was compelled to placo his
former superior In a city ambulance
and have him sent to the city dispen
sary. From tho dispensary tho fam
ily and friends of the stricken man
wero notified, a private ambulanco
was called and Mr. Stewart was con
veyed to St. Luko's hospital.

and wero a
Hiram, tho Phoenician king, aro only
a sad reminder of a glory that has do
parted. Tho cedars havo lost tholr claim to
bo tho prido ot Lebanon; barren gran
deur and beauty of color aro in theso
days tho leading characteristics ot
theso dollghtful mountains, for nakod
rock and storllo scrco now reign
where once dnrk forests thrived. Yet
sufficient remains to show what Lob-
anon must havo been In tho old days;
a mockery, no doubt, of their ancient
splendor, but on tho other hand an
interesting relic and a valuablo heri
tage. Living trees such as theso,
which their most sangulno admirers
claim to havo been contemporary with
Solomon, must bo reckoned as one of
tho historic treasures ot tho world.
Not only does their famo rest upon
traditional grounds; tholr beauty of
form nnd power of growth havo been
extolled in psalm and verso by tho
bards ot many lands, while their shad
owy groves in still earlier days were
tho object of veneration.
Tho primitive nature worshippers
could not havo chosen a finer Ideal
than this giant tree perfect In every
moment of Its existence, an emblem of
beauty, strength and vitality.
It is easy to understand tho admira
tion that tho cedars evokod In their
nativo land. To tho Inhabitants of tho
otherwise barren Lebanon, to tho wan
derers In tho deserts beyond, and oven
to tho dwellers In tho hill country of
Palestine, theso trees must havo beon
miracles of creation. Theso people
only know tho dcllcato palm, tho
gnarled ollvo and stunted scrub oak;
compared with theso tho gigantic
bolos and spreading arms of tho lordly
cedar wero Indeed a mystery. In nny
land It Is n treo that attracts atten
tion; but in such n naked, treeless
country as Syria nnd Palostlno It Is
especially appreciated. Small wonder
that It bocame "tho tree of tho Lord"
and a symbol of power. Tho eastern
mind could find no better simile for
expressing greatness, grandour, ox
cellenco of character or loftiness of
purpose Tho might ot tho Assyrian
cmplro wa3 likened to the cedar In
words too wonderful to bo loft un
quoted: "Behold, tho Assyrian was a cedar
In Lebanon with fair branches, nnd
with a shadowing shroud, and ot an
high staturo; and bis top was among
tho thick boughs.
"Tho wators mado him great . . .
therefore his height was exalted abovo
alt tho trees of tho field, nnd his
boughs woro multiplied, nnd his
branches becamo long becauso of tho
multltudo of waters, when ho shot
forth.
"All tho fowls of heavon mado their
nests In his boughs, and under his
branches did nil tho beasts of tho field
bring forth tholr young, nnd under his
shadow dwelt all great nations.
"Thus was he fair In his greatness,
In tho length ot his branches: for his
root was by great waters.
"Tho cedars in tho garden of God
could not hldo him: tho fir trccB wero
not llko his bouchs. and tho chestnut
! trees wero not llko his branches, nor
any tree In tho garden ot God wbb llko
him In his beauty.
"I havo mado hlra fair by tho multl
tudo of his branches: so thnt all tho
trees of Eden, thnt wero In tho garden
of God, envied him."

Is guaranteed by tho promlso that "ho I
shall grow llko a cedar In Lebanon."
And when tho earth is shrouded in
misfortune and tragedy, tho metaphor
used 1b: "Lebanon Is ashamed and
hewn down."
But tho cedar has fallen on bad
days; It has not escaped tho curso
that has settled on to thoso fair lands.
Tho blight of desiccation, tho ravages
of unthinking and unworthy guardians,
tho canker ot a stagnant government,
havo all done their sharo In tho de
struction of what was onco the glory
of on historic land.
In tho days ot yoro the cedars wero
not carefully guarded relics, but actu
ally formed tho sourco of n lucratlvo
timber business. As long ngo as 2450
B. C. wo know that tho contractors of
tho Babylonian kings brought cedars
from tho AmanuB Mountains, In north
ern Syria, to tho Euphrates, whence
thoy floated them down to their des
tination. Even ns late ns 1000 B. C.
they must havo been very plentiful,
for Solomon raised a levy of 30,000
aliens In tho Land of Israel for tho
solo purpose of hewing timber in Leb
anon. Tho supply, no doubt, gradually do
creased as tho population Increased
and tho rainfall diminished. Tho un
controlled destruction of tho forests
went on without interruption, so that
in tho absence of regeneration tholr
doom was sealed. Whnt Is left of tho
former glory of Lebanon Is but a few
Isolated nnd comparatively Insignifi
cant groves. In point ot fact, thero
aro today flvo distinct groups of ce
dars, but tho most famous of theso
does not possess abovo 400 treos, all
told; and of thoso thero Is a very
small proportion of real patriarchs.
Tho actual geographical distribution
of this cedar Is not limited to the
Lebanon. It also exists on tho Amnnus
mountnlns, in northorn Syria, and on
tho Taurus range, In Asia Minor;
whllo Codrus Llbani Is really only a
local form of a largo family which
thrives in tho Himalaya as the deodar,
nnd in North Africa as tho Algerian
cednr. As a matter of fact, tho Leb

Hiram's forests with a glamour ot
their own.
Here, in their anclont home, tho
residue ot thoso forests which onco
darkened tho seaward slopes of love-'
ly Lebanon still hold their own, aided
by tho timely protection granted them,
by European sympathizers. At an
altitude of about 0,300 feet above the
sea, in sheltered amphitheaters sur
rounded by naked ridges and imposing
crags, nestle tho flvo remaining groups
ot cedars. Nono of them Is moro than

Tripoli. In tho neighborhood Is a.
comparatively new grovo which was
startod and prosorvod by a local Ma

groups aro In tho southern Lobanon,
and aro moro eaBily approached from

station of Aln Sofa, on the Damascus
railway. Those threo are all close to

nnmes of tho villages to which they
belong, namely, Aln Zahalta, Maaslr
and Baruk. Ot these, the Baruk
grovo is tho best known and most fre

though, aro to bo found In the north
