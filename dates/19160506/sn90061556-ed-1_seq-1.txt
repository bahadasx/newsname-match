being with their troops in the van
guard of the American forces under
General "Pershing nearly five hundred
miles beyond the border, under the
leadership ot their brave and gallant
Colonel Brown, and their own beloved
Major Young, who is reputed to be
the most brilliant tactician in the
army and an, expert marksman of re
markable accuracy. To say that Ma
jqr Young is beloved by his men -Is
putting It mildly as they not only
consider him a groat leader, but we
-also consider him the foremost repre
sentative of his race in America to-

a hundred troopers were present to
receive ul, as well as Chaplain Prio
leau, who after informal greetings and
introduction escorted us to his elegant
Oldsmoblle, the best car -at the Post,
and placing us'ln th'e caTO"iof his 'ex

mounted his magnificent fuil-blood'ed
Arabian charger and carried us to his
official residence, one of the' most im

warmly greeted by the madam, who
has become extremely popular by her
gracious manner and pleasing dispo

DR. UNTHANK APPOINTED SUPER
INTENDENT OF COLORED
HOSPITAL.
At a' meeting of the hospital and
health board Dr. Thomas C. Un thank
was appointed superintendent ot tho .
old city hospital, a long merited ap
pointment. He is a native son of North Carolina
and this grand old state has given
many illustrious sons and daughters
to the race. He received his academ
ic training at Benedict college and hl3
professional training at Howard uni
versity. Soon after graduation he
came to Kansas City and began the
practice of medicine and for eighteen
years ho. has responded to the call of
suffering humanity. Six years of that
time he wa3 In the employ ot the city,
having served under Mayors Jones,
Neft and Beardsley. While engaged
as physician at the old work house he
saw the necessity of someone to In
vestigate and recommend to the mayor
the pardon and parole of prisoners,
and it was from this recommendation
that the mayor appointed a pardon
and parole board out of which grew
the Welfare Board with its various
activities.
Besides being one of the most suc
cessful and efficient physicians of the
city, he is one of the most public
spirited men in the community. No
movement Inaugurated for the better
ment of his people that does not en
list his support and co-operation. When

DR. T. C. UNTHANK.
The dean of the Negro medical profes

ed this week superintendent of the
City Hospital for Negroes, succeed
ing Dr. Wm. J. Thompklns, who has
made a great reputation thero dur
ing the past two years.
prejudice forced us to cease patron
izing soda fountains operated by the
whites he, with several other physi
cians, opened a drug store and from
that beginning we now have seen well
appointed drug stores operated by our
people.
It was largely through his efforts
that the Douglass hospital was estab
lished in Kansas City, Kas. He was
chairman of the committee that raised
$2,200 for the buying of Masonic hall.
He Is now one of the most active mem
bers of the Federated Charities, a body
composed of colored citizens who look
after the charities of the Negroes of
Kansas City. While he has found that
he made no mistake in his calling from
a financial standpoint, it must be con
ceded that he has the true profes
sional spirit which bids him answer the
call from which he expects no remu
neration whatever as willingly as that
from which he hopes to collect a large
fee. Many a person's name has been
entered in his books from whom the
only fee collected has been a smile
of gratitude and a prayer to our all
Father to bless Tom Unthank.
His wife is Indeed a help meet, and
will contribute largely to his success
In his new field of endeavor. His
daughter Louise Is a charming Miss
and will graduate in June from- Lin
coln High school. His two nephews,
Edgar and DeNorval, whom he rather
regards as his sons and who have for
several years shared the protection
and comforts ot his home, will also
receive their diplomas from our high
school at the approaching commence
ment. The doctor goes Into office with the
good wishes of his own people tor his
success. They feel confident that his
administration will be all that close
application, conscientious work and
ability ot a high order can make it.
It will be .gratifying to his many
patients to whom he has administered
so faithfully and efficiently In the past
years to know that they will not be
deprived of his professional services
for he will be pleased to Berve them
at his office, Independence and Harri
son streets, at the usual hours.
BUSINESS MEN WANTED OUT
WEST.
Great Falls. Mont. Wo have COO
colored people, with one church, three
lodges but no hall to meet In. We
have no restaurants or business houses
of any kind among tho race people.
There are possibilities for men of the
race to make money by investing in
business ventures here. We need a
drug store, lco cream parlor and soda
parlor, and above all that there is
need ot a hall for entertainments ot
various kinds. Montana Is looking
forth for a more prosperous year thaa
ever history has known.
