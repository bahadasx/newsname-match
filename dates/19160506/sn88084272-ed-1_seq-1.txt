Germany in her note reserves "com

Krltaln to bring her practices Into uni

official view is that the United States

the success or failure of the negotia

of the party still is in the saddle.
In the armory auditorium was more
than a scattering of former Progres
sives and of the non-organization sec
tion of the party, but such delegates
were not bunched and lacked cohesion.
Rather rallying around tbe majority of
the Maricopa county delegation they
had consumed most of the night in
trying to find a way to offset the work
of the more experljnced wing, which
spent the same time in coolly provid
ing for all contingencies and even In
the selection of the various convention
committees.
The Maricopa county delegates,
though embracing nearly a third of the
convention, were too late on the
ground, though they had left their
sleepers at Maricopa station and had
hurried here to caucus at midnight.
On the face of 'things, the main
struggle Is over the selection of the
Arizona member of the national com
mittee. Ralph H. Cameron wants to be.
returned. In bygone days not long ago,
he was affiliated closely with the or- I
