MAN'S GREATEST NEED
Faith in God* Nay, verily. We
believe in God low, but we be
lieve with a heavy heart. Mau'a
greatest need is a free earth.
All aro willing to admit now
that wo erred in trying to hold our
fellow men—slave«. liut — we've
discarded Thai crude and cumber
some method of enslaving them;
we have discovered another much
more subrle and refined, which
is—iustead of holding them as
chattels—to appropriate the land
on which, aud from which they
must live.
This, like the tariff, is not only a
process of getting the most feath
era from the human goose—with
the least squawking but has be
sides many other advantages over
the antiquated and less profitable
methods of chattel slavery.
The North and East having

Improved method of appropriat
ing the earnings ot labor about
them did uot find it profitable to
keep the negro race as chattels.
They gladly exchanged them for
money or laud in the South, where
as they truly said, the negro
found a more congenial climate.
It was only when the arrogance
and domineering tyranny of the
slaveowners began breaking out
here aud there, that the North be
came aroused agaiust the South.
It was about this time too, that
Einmerson, one of those rare hr
ings who believed in tailing tli
beam out of Ins own eye before he
attempted to extract the mote
from that of hts brother, told in
contemporaries "that he bad
patience with their sympathy for
black folk a thousand miles off
He rightly thought doubtless it
should begin with the poor
their own doors.
Chattel slaves and serfs have
everywhere been nominally freed
but the world is just now awaken
iug to the fact that we are all
slaves, till we free the earth, ou
oommnn mother. England owns
millions of acres of laud in this
country, from which a stream
gold, "thick and heavy" Hows
that country every year even dur
ing these troublous war times
In 1914, the winter following the
outbreak of the war, the crowned
beads of Europe bought up im
mense tracts of land in tbe middle
aBd western states.
Land ownership is man owner
ship when any man or set of men
is permitted to hold valuable land
for which there is an active de
mand. Therefore man's greatest
need today is a free earth.
This will make all men free
abolish poverty, the great school
house of Grime, make wars an im
possibility forovermore, and eua
hie us each and all to sit under
his own vine and fig tree, with
none to molest or make afraid.
Then we can go seriously about
tbe busiuess of making this world
a paradise, a heaven let down to
earth and our faith in God will
become a living reality in our lives,

From Walter Parker, New Or
leans.
National highwaya running
North, South, East and West will
traverse the states of Louisiana
and Mississippi, if the plans of
the good roads enthusiasts carry
—and they are predicated on
sound doctrine. Tbe national
movement of preparedness will
prove a big incentive for better
roads for military purposes, aside
from their great value as avennes
of commerce and Bocial inter
course.
Louisiana and Mississippi are
expected to do their share in pro
moting the building of good
roads. It is up to tbe people of
both States to get behind their
legislators and inject the viras of
natioual highways in their minds.
Nothing shoold be overlooked in
gaining tbe advantage of having
these big national systems oome
to the sister States of Louisiana
and Mississippi.

is based upon the hope that it
will pass from view as a politica
factor in this government.

sometime before its doctrines are

this government will come to tin
men who advance its welfare un
selfishly ami wit h the only hope
of reward is duty well and faith
fully performed.
A glance at the records will
prove tliar it is making some dan
gerous headway in Louisiana.
We have one congressman on
duty at Washington, one member
of the State board of equalization,
thirteen members of the lower
house of the general assembly and
live senators in the upper chain
ber, and besides this the demo
cratic majorities in several par
ishes in Louisiana came near going
the other way
This is the liest showing made
by any party, including the de
mocracy itself prior to 1880, when
it came into power. Then why
should the death of the Progrès
sive organization be such a cer
tainty before that occurrence
takes place, or even be visible as
a possibility of the future.
The next election will more ful
ly explain this question than any
prognostication of the present
coming from that quarter where
such a happening would be em
braced with much pleasure, an
briug joy and happiness created
by a new born hope, aud incident

Catron, Ky.—In an interesting letter
from this place, Mrs. Bettle Bullock
writes as follows : "1 suffered for four
years, with womanly troubles, and during
this time, 1 could only sit up for a little
while, and could not walk anywhere at
afi. At times, I would have severe pains
in my left side.
The doctor was called In, and his treat
ment relieved me for a while, but 1 was
soon confined to my bed again. After
that, nothing seemed tod any good.
