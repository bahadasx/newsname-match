SHEEP KILLING CASE
FILLS COURT ROOM
Squire Musgrave Holds His
First Civil Jury
Trial.
Two doga the primary cause of a
civil tiction being hckrd in Squire- M.
K. Muagrov? today that has attracted
more interested-spectators than any of
the famous bootlegging eases. The
"bone of contention' in this caso is
the bones of three dead sheep and
CO injured sheep. The bones oi tlio
dogs have been buried now for sonic
time. The suit was instituted by Gil-'
bert Moore, afarmer who lives in
Monongalia county, but has a sheep,
farm near Bassnettsviile in Paw Paw
district Marion county. The defend
ants in the action areArbrose Bill
ings! and Calvin Emery, residents of
Paw Paw district. Moore claims thut
the dogs of Billingslea and Emery, at
tacked his sheep and killed 7 valued
at $7 each and injured 36 to the dam
age of $1 each. This is the cum tol
al $62, returned by the appraising com
mittee and ,led with the county court
clerk. x
Billingslea refused to pay the suni
as he contended that only Emery's
dog did the damage. Suit was then
brought by Moore to obtain a Judg
ment for the amount. Hearing of th*j
evidence in the case was begun early
this morning before a jury composed
of R. 0. Musgrove, W. E. Morgan, J,
W. Morgan, George Shomaker. G. W.
Barnes and Glen Morris. Twenty-two
witnesses were summoned and appear
ed in the case. The court room of
Squire Musgrove was loo small to ac?
commodate the witnesses, Jurors and
attorneys so the trial was held in the
circuit court room. Attorney M. l..
Sturm represented the plaintiff anil
Attbrney Frank Amos represented
Billingslea.
Considerable of a surprise was mani
fested among the spectators when
Emery went upon the witness 3tano
and testified In favor of the plaintiff,
he being supposedly one of the de
fendants. Emery admitted that his
dog had killed some of the sheep but
that Billingslea's dog also killed some.
Both of the dogs were shot shortly
after the dead sheep were discovered.
Since Emery owns no proprty none
of Uie., damage his dog,did, can--be
recovered. At a late hour this after
noon the testimony was still being
heard and it is doubtful if the case
gets to the Jury oefore night. Squire
Musgrove stated that this is the first
civil case that has required a Jury
since he has been in office.
Berlin Refuses to

BERLIN, May 6.?The utter lack of|

An Open Letter
By W. H. Veach
Farmington, W. Va., May 5th, 1916.
To The Republicans of Marion
County:?
1 have today handed to the West
Virginian an announcement of my
candidacy for tho nomination for
Sheriff of Marlon County subject
to the will of tho Republican voters
in the Primaries of June 6th.
It will be romembered that a
short time ago 1 announced through
the columns of the West Virginian
that I should not be a candidate,
stating my reasons therefor. That
announcement 1 meant to be final.
However, being besieged by my
friends to such an extent that I can
scarcely ignore their demands, I re
spectfully cast my hat into the ring
%nd make this announcement to ask
your support and influenco towards
my nomination, promising my time
and energy to tho placing of the
county in the Republican column.
I have been reluctant to embark
in the race and in the beginning had
no personal desire to enter into
politics other than to lend my us
ual aid to the party in tho successy
ful issue of the coming campaign,
but, feeling that I can find much
support, and from the expression of !
friend** all over tho county desiring
me to enter the race, I am confident
of a unity-of the Republicans of the
county such as we have not seen !
for years and that there will be vic
tory for the party in the fall elec
tion.
I respectfully solicit the support
of the Republican voters in the pri- i
marles and take this means of
..thanking one.and all for any-Inter
est they may take in my candidacy. I

bandits at Ojo-azules, 17 miles south of Cusihumf
early yesterday.
Forty two Mexicans were killed and a number jgoj;
There were no American casualties.
The American command under Major Robert lI|Howze j
had been pursuing the bandits under Generals Gf

countered them encamped in the huddle adobe of OjraAz

The Mexicans were completely surprised and |]S

shots they began a flight, each man shifting for his|gg
safety. Some of them were able to seize their hori
