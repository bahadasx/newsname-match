A LEAGUE OF NATION 'S TO
INSURE MORE LASTING
PEACE AT END OF
WAR.
An appeal to American 'busi
ness men to interest themselves in
! the league-of-nations movement j
as embodied in the proposals of
jtiw League to Lntorce Peace, of j
! which ex-President Taft is head. |
has been received by the New
j Iberia Chamber of Commerce. !
I The appeal is made in eonnec
jtion with an invitation to all com- J
jmereial organizations throughout j
the United States, to send dele-j
gates to the first annual assem-jhe
'age of the League, which is to be |
h°Id in Washington on IMay 26th ,
and 27th. The communication is
signed by William II. Taft, Alton
B. Parker. President A. Lawrence !
Lowell of Harvard University, j a
Herbert S. Houston. George E.
Roberts, and Edward A. Filene. It
reads in part:
•'We conceive the program of
the League to Enforce Peace to
be of vital importance to the un- 1
interrupted development of com
'mercial organizations, of political
and social institutions and to the!
organization, at the close of the
I war, of i;«t!«e a»vl pence ?hrou"h
'out the world. The movement is
being introduced in every Amer
ican city, and it is desirable that
a crroup of representative men in
each shall have that intimate in
si*ht into it which will be ob
tamed from attendance at the
Washington meeting."
Messrs. Filene, Houston,
Roberts mentioned above, were
members of a special committee
of the Chamber of Commerce of
the United States, which prepared!
a report showing the effect of the
war on American business inter
of eeonomm
csts, and which outlinp^ a scheme
intended to secure a more lasting
peace, similar to that proposed by
the League to Enforce Peace, em
nhasizing the value of* eeonomiej
pressure as a sanction. This plan
|was submitted to a referendum
jvote of the Chamber of Commerce
jlast >ear. Extracts from the rp -
port reprinted under the title
American Business and W orld
Peace, are made part of the corn
munication signed by Mr. Taft,
♦Tudge Parker and the other?.
Some of its more striking para
[graphs follow ;
All Americans are profoundlv
moved by the war, whether viewed
from its moral or material aspects.
Especially is th-'s true of Ameri
can brsiness men who, through
their business relations, are close
ly in touch with the actual condi
tions in Europe. Moreover, the
knowledge that War fundament
tally injures the business struc
jture and the trained power of the
successful business men to ac
jcomplish results has created in
[them the will for morei lasting
I peace.
As business men, we cannot fail
jto foresee that if this war is set
tled as all previous wars have
[been, without providing for the
'duly constituted authority,"
I there will be added to its enorm
ous charges the still greater con
tinuous charges due to rivalry in
I armaments and other preparations
I for the "next settlement."
Under such conditions, we are
[forced to believe that the En. o
nean nations, after the war, will
be faced with the insistent need
for re-establishing their indus
tries at almost any sacrifice in or
der to keep up in the race for
armaments and to obtain means of
setting their debts so as to keep
their credit good for the next
'«•nr. Predictions bv students of
Iaffairs alreadv abound that these
j necessities -will cause them to
11 make sicrifices of natural profits.
|lower their scale of living, and
so create competition of unex
amined severity, a competition
which also would be particularly
■om'nors for our higher-wage mar
,ket. that so far has suffered least.
Should a period of unrest and
uncertainty follow an unsettling
I j "settlement," the United States
will not he free to determine what
(increase, if any. she will make in
her armaments, hut may he forced
j into an abnormally great increase,
with correspondingly abnormal
tax and other 'hardens.

There is a difference of opinion
as to the employment of for-c to
compel any signatory nation to
submit its ca.se to an interna
tional tribunal before going to
war. Your committee, however,
believes that the great majority

| see the necessity of the employ
ment of an adequate pressure or
! force,to compel signatory nations
to bring their cause before an In
J ternational Court or Coi m il of

because however desirable it may
theoretically not to use force

during that time and the <
of tlfe present war have made ap

If mi ii tary force is to he used

ultimately would, by this means,
replace war.
that
American citizens, realizing the
world's imperative need of the
substitution of law for war, if
militarism is not to dominate, are
ready, nay feel it the clear call of
dutv to take their share of the
work and responsibility necessary
to establish this substitution. We
.cannot escape if we would. We
would not if we could. The call
of women and children, of the J
helpless and the weak, suffering
indescribably from needless war,
is an irresistible compulsion to all
Americans, and not least to Amer
ican business men.
Your committee believes that
the time is ripe as never before
for the fundamental advance in
civilization that the establishing
of an International Court and
Council represents. We know
that the hope and the best and
sanest thimking of the world have
been in that direction.
The time must inevitably come
when the world will provide some
better method than war for deal
ing with the questions that arise
between nations. Yor.r commit
tee believe that it is practically
possible that the time has arrived.

if the I nited States will but do its
share of the work. There is lit
tle real hope for success if the
United States is not a part of it.
For it is being demonstrated by
this war that success in modern
war depends largely oil adequate,
supplies of ammi nition and other
war materials. Of these, the
United States is capable of the
largest and least interrupted pro
duction. If, at the close of the
war, there exists the legalized
