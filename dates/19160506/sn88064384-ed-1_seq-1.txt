It is difficult to say how
often corn should be culti
vated as that will depend on
the weather conditions. If it
rains every week the ground
will form a crust. This must
be broken and the soil mulch
restored, or the moisture will
be lost by evaporation. Cul

WHY
„ Y OX
Should Attend
SPENCER BUSINESS COLLEGE.
Because men now travel on wings, talk by lightning,
annihilate both time and space, by means of the telephone,
and require 100 per cent efiicieney in their employes.
Because a thorough business education, with shorthand
and typewriting gives the greates guarantee of success.
You must make a LIVING whether you want tool not.
Hie right kind of a business education gives the surest
means of acquiring the former, and the easiest way to make
the latter.
Because its faculty greets its audience each morning with
interest so vital, purposes so useful, originality so varied,
ideas so new, fresh and bountiful, that each day's work is
a performance possible only to such co-operative forces.
Because the methods employed in both the Commercial
and Shorthand departments are simple, easy, fascinating,
and the time required to master them is about one-half the
time it takes to half-way master the old systems.
Because we conduct a Free Employment department,
and have au experienced man to devote his time to that
work alone.
