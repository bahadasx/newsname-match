for waterworks for Covington will
take place May 16, 1916. The sprop
osition seems to be much more favor
abyo considered than- the sewer and
waterworks plan, and many who oJ
po ed sewers will vote for '.le water

M.. E. J. Froe.arick is flihting wate:r

this is not so. That while he is not
working for it be is not working
against it. He is neutral in tVe mat

With the proposed waterworks sys
tem insurance rates will be decreased
fro 10 to 33 1-3 per cent, depending
upon the class of buildings. Dlwels
ing risks will be reduced 10 per
cent, frame mercantile risks from 10
to 15 per cent, and brick buildings
from 15 to 33 1-3 per cent. The
public school, which now pays $000
for three years insurance, will pay
$400 for the same amount. The
Louisiana Fire Prevention Bureau
has approved the plans of Engineer
Kramer for his waterworks systeg
and these figures are taken from the
insurance agents, .s a result of tha:
approval.

Messrs. Herman Schultz, President
Police Jury; E. E. Lyon, Supt. of
Education, Covington, La.
Dear Sirs:-The following stt e
ment of the lines cf work and duties
of the parish demonstration agent is
made on your request for such In
formation.
The purpose of the demonstration
work is to teach by objet. lessons.
These object lessons are to show the
results that can be obtained by the
application of better methods of
farming. The farmer learns by do
Ing and the demonstration agent
teaches by showing.
Each object lesson is a demonstra
tion and may be of corn, oats, hay,
truck or any other crop. The plan
of the work is for the agent to have
from fifty to one hundred demon
strations located in the different
wards of the parish according to pop
ulation and the cooperation that the.
farmers ^how him. The demonstra
tions are located as publicly as
possible along public roads with the;
farmers who will agree to follow the
demonstration methods in working
their demonstration crops. The idea
i.' to influence as many people of the
community as possible to do better
farming through the success of the
demonstration. The farmer Is the
imr)ortant cog in tne machine as he
is the demonstrator-the one who
does the work and who does the
proving or demonstrating. The dem
onstration agent is the one who acts
for both the farmer and the farm
demonstration work. The agent
brings the. message of and informa
tion about the better farming meth
ods, and helps the farmer to put th'
information to work on the demon.
stration. The farmer does thr
work and reaps the benefit.
'Live "tock demonstras,tions are alac
carried on with the farmers who
Want them by the parish agent and
the specialists from thq V(lversitt
it will require a tax of five mills to
take care of these bonds. This mill
age will be decreased as the assess
ment is increased. As a committee
is now working on the assessment
roll with a view to equalizing taxes,
there is little doubt that the assess
ment will be increased considerably
This is the general opinion, the only
difference being as to the amount of
increase.
Opelousas waterwdikt are earning
$100 per month for the town, and a
20-year bond issue was retired by
the use of this revenue with the taxes
in twelve years. Hammond is re
ceiving $75 per month from its
waterworks.
Retent fires at Slidell and the con
tinuous alarmsin Covington are con
stant reminders that Covington needs
a complete system for the protection
of property. The fire department i.
especlaHy desirous of having the sys
tem put in. The new motor truck of
the chemical enables it to get to the
fires in good time, and funds are now
being raised to have the pump engine
also equipped with motive power.
With available water in all parts of
the town and the means to reach fires
promptly the department will be in
fne shape to protect property from
fire.

As it is perfectly impossible for
for the agent to visit all the farmers
in his parish, he is only required to
visit his demonktrgtors (those work
ing demonetrations), but he must
visit these every month, if possible.
The balance of the farmers can be
and are enrolled as cooperators on
promising to try out the demonstra
tion methods on a certain area o'
their farms. The cooperators are
mailed the same bulletins and circu
lars as are given to the demonstra
tors. The difference is thast the
agent is not required to visit their
farms except under exceptional con
ditions. The cooperators should he
invlted by postal card to meet the
agent on his visits to the demonstra.
tor.s in their respective neighbor
hoods. At these demonstration fiel
meetings, the agent discusses the
methods of preparation of soil, plant
ing, cultivation, or seed selection ac
cording to the season.
The farm demonstration Work ap
preciating the impossibility of the
agent visiting every farmer individu
ally has developed this plan of
reaching the farmers by demonstrer
tions and field meetings of coopera
tors. In order to best meet the needy
of the farmeres -and their families
there should be organized a farmerr
association for each school distric'
with monthly meetings held at th
schoolhouse. The agent could mee'
with these associations and his ser
vices would reach and benefit a much
larger number oftpeople in each com
munity.
The work of as agent must be
adapted to meet -the needs of hir
parish. In geperal, the following
main Hnes of Oork should be under
taken:
1. SBoil ipprovement demon
strations to Increase fertility
and productiveness.
2. Crop production demon
strations to increase yields, to

Folsom Woke Up
Folsom woke up and found itself
in a peculiar situation, last week.
There should have been an election
for mayor and aldermen April 18,
but the town slept on its rights and
no election was ordered. To correct
this oversight it was decided to call
an election on May 12. 'But there
were legal difficulties in the way of
this procedure, so a petition was cir
culated asking the governor to order
an election. IMeantime the officers
holding over are in doubt as to their
liabilities, responsibilities and duties.
Folsom is a little "woke" up, and
begins to know what it is to be in
the arena of full-fledged corporate
intracacies.
