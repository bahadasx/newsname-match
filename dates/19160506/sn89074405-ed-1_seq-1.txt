OJO-AZULES 42 ARE HUB) AND
Rebels Were Huddled in Adobe Houses When Attacked
Sprang From Pallets Half Clad and Fled for
]Hill»—Remnants of Band arp Chased.
Field Headquarters, Namiquipa, Mexico, May 6.—A
full squadron of 230 of the Eleventh cavalry surprised and
routed a much larger force of Villa bandits at Ojo-Azules,
IT miles south of Cusihuiriachic early yesterday. Forty
two Mexicans were killed and a number wounded. There
were no American casualties.
The American command, under Major Robert L.
Howze, had been pursuing the Villistas under Generals
Cruz Dominguez and Julio Acosta, for several days, when
they encountered them yesterday, encamped and huddled
in the adobes of Ojo-Azules. The Mexicans were utterly
surprized and sprang from their pallets half clothed.
After firing a few wild shots they began flight, each
man shifting for his own safety. Some of them were able
to seize their horses, already jaded from a hard day's ride,
but others made their way into the hills afoot.
In Major Howze's report, he said the rout had been
absolute, and that he still was pursuing scattered remnants
of the band. The band engaged was the largest remain
ing under the Villa standard, and yesterday's decisive vic
tory gave much satisfaction to military men here.
.Meeting with resistance, they decided to wait until "w»i"g before
ribnrliig the effort

Paris. May 6.—The French evacuat

front, west of the Meuse. as the re
sult of an unusually violent bombard
ment by heavy German guns. The
war office this afternoon says, how
ever, that all efforts of the Germans
to advance were checked by French
giins, and that a fresh division of
troops, which the Germans brought
into action, sustained great losses. At
tacks north and northwest of Hill 804
were repulsed at the point of bavo

Maximilian Harden De

Berlin, May 6—After figuratively

weeks ago by a daring article, "If I

returns to an exhaustive defense of
Wilson and his policy, and the entire
American standpoint.
In a leader in the Zukunft, entitled,
"The Real Wilson," Harden praised
Wilson as "a man of high moral and
high spiritual character, of whom we
might be proud if he were ours."

Wllliston, N.. D.. May 6.—U. L. Bur
dick, who is asking the republican
nomination for governor, today made
public a statement in which he sets
forth his views of certain Issues that
have been raised In the North Dakota
campaign by the Non-partisan league
—placing himself on record as being
opposed to the principle of state own
ership of such industries as packing
plants, elevators, flour mills, etc.,
pointing to the fact, that such indus
tries would become political, and
would doubtless be operated without
regard t6 practical economy and effi
ciency^
Mr. Burdick's statement follows:
"The Non-partisan league has de
clared in its platform that it is in fa
vor of state terminal elevators, pack
ing plants, flour mills, etc. From this
rather simblglous statement It is dif
ficult to determine just what position
the league has taken in reference to
the public utilities question.
"Generally speaking, I am opposed
to the state of North Dakota going in
to speculative business enterprises.
Should this state build packing plants
and flour mills with funds raised from
the taxpayers, what assurance would
tbe taxpayers have that (through a
political machine) In the building and
ooeratinrf of such enterprises, there
would be efficiency, business judgment
and economy Sxercised. Would 'the
more, natural presumption be that
politics, rather than competency,.

ATTACKS IN VIOLATION Of PROMISE
Teutonic People Receive Rejoiner With Utter Lack of Ex
citement—United States May Notify Germany of
Acceptance of the New Submarine Orders. ^.
Washing^n May 6.—The official text of Germany's
note, fully decoded, was laid before President Wilson. It
shows no material differences from the unofficial text pub'
lished yesterday in news dispatches. This strengthens
the probability that a diplomatic break has been averted,
at least for the present.
An over7riight study of the note by cabinet members
and officials did not change their view that probably there
will be no break in diplomatic relations unless there are
further attacks in violation of international law.
There is a possibility that the United States may
make a brief reply notifying the Berlin government that as
long as the new orders to submarine commanders are fully
observed diplomatic relations will not be discontinued on
that score.
President Wilson read today with careful attention the purlin of'
the German note touching on peace.
Some officials believed unusual significance ahonld be attached to
that part of the note, because it is taken to indicate officially that tike
recent speeches of Chancellor von Bcthmann-Hollweg before thereisch
tng were Intended as notices to the world that Germany is ready for
peace on certain terms.
While it indicates that President Wilson would make no further
peace moves until the allied governments signified their willingness to
receive suggestions on the subject, some officials thought the note
might possibly draw forth something from the allies.
Berlin. May R.—Hir utter lack of excitement on the part of a.wn-^
