The Trince Consolidated Mining &
Smelting company shipped during
month of April a tota.1 of 14,072
tons of ore, or ave-rag-a tor each
day of 46S tons The liny output
is beiug maintained at alout 500
tons.
The Record learns frcn Manager
M. C. Godbe that all of the equip
ment for the new mill at Buliion
ville has been ordered and several
i-vt loads of iiuchinerv h:ire ar
rived. The contract for the construct
ion of the plant has been let to A. M.
MacDonald of Salt Lake, who is ex
pected to be on the ground today to
begin organizing his force of work
men. The plant haa been designed enpec
ially to treat the big tailings dumps
owned by the Trince company at
Uullioriville, estimated to contain 70,
000 tons; and the Dry Valley tailings
dump, estimated at 50,000 tons.
The mill will have capacity to take
care of 200 tons per day, and oil
flotation will be employed as one of
the means of extracting the values.
As the tailings dump ores are
largely oxidized, the material will un
dergo a process of sulphidizing
through the application of sodium
sulphide and agitation. The process
has been worked out very successful
ly by Mr. Sherwood, the company's
metallurgical engineer.
The company contemplates the
construction in the near future of a
DOOO-foot spur from mile post" 23
on the Caliente & Pioce railroad to
Dry Valley. The ore will be loaded on
the cars and shipped to ISullionville
to be milled.
It is a well known fact that the
Prince company is working out a
. plan to treat the lower grade ores of
the mine and its is not at all un
likely that details will be gone into
more thoroughly after the Builion
yjlle plant is out of the way.

Prior to April 12, 1916, tnere had
been issued a total of 2795 automo

Nevada, according to a list of num

ad and issued by Secretary of State
George Brodigan. The compilation is
made up according to counties and
gives the residence of each person
to whom licenses have been issued.
Washoe county heads the list both

FROM THE HAMBURG
Recent developments made at the
Hamburg, one of the properties of
l.he Mendha-Nevada Mining company,
:iave been of a decidely gratifying
character and it is beginning to look
like a coming big producer.
Three cars of ore shipped during
the past few weeks brought returns
which causes those interested in the
Mendha to wear broad smile3.
The option given to John Janney
ind associates of Pittsburg expired
esterday, without a payment having
jeen made and owners of the prop
jrty are glad that the easterners
.'ailed to come across with the pur
jhase price, for they can see- more

TUNGSTEN CLAIMS ARE
SOLI) FOR $ 15,00)
The Redlish Tungsten company,
represented by Col. O. P. Posey, has
taken over the group of claims locat
ed last December near Redlich, six
teen miles south of Mina. The sale
was made through the efforts of J.
F. Hart of Lovelock for a considera
tion of $15,000 of which $10,000 was
paid to bind the bargain.
The ground was owned by Sol
Summerfield and others.
One of the strongest recommenda
tions of the company as an early pro
ducer is the fact that the property is
covered with rich float carrying high
percentage of tungstic acid that may
be recovered by placering while a
shaft is being sunk ou ,t'lw lode hold

$205.06, setting forth that the county
is indebted to him for that sum by
reason of having wrongfully sold to

veyed' in March, 1906, to W. E. Orr,
the identical property.
Mr.' Dickie asks . reembursement
for the principal, $125; interest on
the principal at 7 per cent, $73.85;
taxes paid amounting to $41.96; in
terest on sums paid for taxes, $14.2G.

Last Sunday a party from town,
consisting of Dr. V. E. Wells, Karl
Mitchel, Cliff Good and a representa
tive of the Scout, took a trip out to
the Isenwood tin discovery, twenty
mi. north of tiattlemountain, and
were taken over the ground by P. S.
Brooks, one of the owners of the
claims, The party found much to in
terest them in this only occurence of
tin in Nevada, and one of the few
places where the metal is found in
the western hemisphere, says the
Battle Mountain Scout.
Geologically, the tin is found in
seams and fracture planes of a tracy
ite ridge striking east-west about 4
miles long and rising to a height of
400 feet above the valley at the Is
enwood ranch a mile distant.
Cassitorite, the dioxide of tin, is
the mineral found and in quite a
number of spots along the course of
the ridge it shows in places, while all
along the flat bordering the ridge and
in all gulches running down its sides,
stream or placer tin is found.

PEIE DELMUE IX. HAD
AUTOMOBILE 'ACCIDENT
P. A. Delmue was the victim of an
auto accident between Lund and Mil
ford last week, the result of which
Pete is carrying a fractured arm.
It appears- that the machine was
being driven rapidly 'and; -the- man" at
the wheel struck a ditch in the road
with such velocity that Tete was
thrown out with the result stated.
C. L. . Alquist, one of Caliente.s
leading business men, was in town
over Wednesday night on business
connected with the lease on the Mag
nolia mine at Delamar, which he re
cently obtained from the Deamar
Exploration company.'
Mr. Alquist proposes to put a force
of men to work at once and plans
to purchase an auto truck and haul
the ore to Caliente for shipment to
the smelters. He believes that it is
possible to mine and transport the
ore to Caliente for not to exceed $5
per ton.
Mr. Alquist will go to Delamar in
a day or two to get the proposed
work under way.
According to what Mr. Alquist has
to say, there are quite a number of
prospectors scouring the bills in the
vicin ty of Delamar. The prevailing
high metal prfces seems to be creat
ing a stir in that section of the
county and the old camp may yet
"come back."
WOMEN'S CIVIC LEAGUE

in the state being represented. The
convention honored Lincoln county
b the election pt Mrs. Col. W. J.
Gregory., of .AJamo, as one of the
le'a'g-ua" vicerpesidents.
Resolution' calling for the modifi
cation oL the-social laws of Nevada
and resolutions proclaiming the Ne
vada Woman's Civic "League a non
partisan political organization were
adopted. ..' .
Other resolutions protesting against
the action of the judiciary committee
in indefinitely postponing a report on
the Anthony amendment and asking
women voters of Nevada to take
an active part in state, county and
municipal elections were also ad
vocated and adopted.

Interested in the ground by taking
over the interest claimed by Fred
Stephenson, but is not mentioned as
one of the defendants.
It is safe to say that probably the
most anoyed person of all was Depu
ty Christensen, who likeB his morn
ing sleep undisturbed.
Prospectors from wjiko Pine coun
ty, who have caught the tungsten
feyer, drifted down into Lincoln
county recently and have establish
ed a camp about four miles from the
Geyser ranch where, it is said, they
have found placer tungsten in what
appears, to be commercial quantity.
Numerous claims have been located
during the past week and people in
the northern end of the county have
become so much excited that it haa
been a difficult matter to keep help
on the ranches. All have become so
intensely worked up over mining
and tungsten mining in particular.
County Auditor Garrison, while
at Geyser last week went up onto
Patterson mountain and staked off
several claims, which, he says; have
some good surface showings of tung
stensten. The Patterson district was
a producer of rich silver-lead ore
years ago when the white metal
was around a dollar an ounce. Now
with prices of silver soaring again
the famous old camp is likely to
come back to its own. The finding of
tungsten ore there too, is bound to
give it a new lease of life.
JUDGE DUCK Kit OUT OF
HACK FOR SUPREME JUDGE
Judge E. A. Ducker, who announc
es candidacy sometime ago for the
Democratic nomination for justice of
the supreme court of Nevada, has de
cided to withdraw and in a statement
given to the press has this to say:
"My reason for this action is that
the bereavement of my wife and my
self, caused by the death of our
young daughter, makes it impossible
for me to think of being a candidate
for office. '
The unqualified endorsement
which my candidacy has been given
by the party from which I sought the
nomination makes it difficult for me
to retire without great regret; but
this feeling is relieved by the thought
that the time is early yet for the se
lection of a candidate acceptable to
the people and creditable to the
bench and bar.
"I wish also to thank the press of
the state for the very complimentary
mention of my candidacy, and the
public for the support . offered me,
which in many instances has not
been bounded by party lines."
