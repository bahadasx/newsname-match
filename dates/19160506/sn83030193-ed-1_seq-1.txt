FIELD JIKADQUAUTEBS, NEAR

Columbus, N. M.). A full squadron
of 230 men of Uio Eleventh Cavalry
surprised and routed a forco of
140 Villa bandits at OJo - Azulos.
seventeen miles south of Cusihurla
chic, early yesterday. Forty-twoMx
leans ,war '-Wiled and a numtecr
wounded. There wcro no American
casualties.
The bandlta, under Gens. Cruz Do
mlncuez and Julio Acosta, had visit
ed OJo-Azulcs the nlRht before nnd
attempted to tako the town from the
("arranza garrison. Meeting with re
sistance, thoy decided to wait until
mornlnR before renewing the effort.
Major Ilowzo nt San Antonio, thlr-ty-slx
miles to tho north, learned of
the situation and set out nt 8.30 at
nlRht with six troops of the Eleventh
Cavalry, reachlns the outskirts of
OJo-AzuIes shortly before dawn. The
Americans camo upon the Vllllstas
encamped In the huddled adobe huts
of tho town.
The Vllllstas were completely stir
prised nnd sprang from their pallets
half clothed. After flrlnir a few wild
shots, they began a flight, each man
shifting for his own safety. Some of
them were nblo to seize their horses,
already Jaded from a hard day's ride
previously, but others made their
way Into tho hills afoot. The run
ning fight lnsted two hours.
Tho American uttack was a cavalry
charge with pistols, the drat to occur
since operations wero begun.
Six Carranza prisoners tho bandits
had been holding for execution wero
released by tho Americans. Seventy
flve horses and mules wero captured
Oen, Antonio Angeles was ono of
tho Mexicans killed. He was a rela
live of Felipe Angeles, tho former
confidant of Villa, who was once
mentioned for tho Presidency of Mex
Ico, nnd who is now living near El
I'aso,
Major Howze reported ho was still
pursuing tho scattered remnant of the
band, which Is tho largest remaining
under tho Villa standard.
It Is' behove 1 the band is the name
as that defeated at Temoehle, April
.'2, by Col, George A, Dodd's com
mand. Major Howze's march of thirty-six
miles was mado In less than nine
hours. This is considered a remark
able record. Col. Dodd's dash for
Ouorrero at tho first of tho American
Invasion covered llfty-flvo miles In
seventeen hours.
Other cavalry detachments are now
operating In the district about San
Antonio.
EL I'ASO, Texas, May C Gen, Scott
expects to sign the El I'aso agreement
with Oen. Obregon, Carranzlsta War
Minister, to-day, establishing between
tho two Governments tho status of tho
American expedition nnd providing
for Its futuro course. Whatever oh
stacles prevented Obregon from sign
ing yesterday were believed to havo
been overcome.
As arrangements went forward for
tho final meeting of the war chiefs,

mandant nt Juarez, and Consul Garcia
of El I'aso, giving them Scott's mes

is declared to havo been n warning
that tho I "nlted States would no long

that If tho Mexicans continued their
attitude of assortlveness nnd dollanco,
tho years 1016 and 1017 would bo
blacker marks In Mexican history
than 1846 and 1S47.
Despite this, Obregon made sweep
ing demands In tho first conference.
It was learned to-day, for withdrawal
of the expedition.
Deflection on Scott's attitude, how
ever, had Its effect on tho Mexican
leader by tho tlmo tho second confer
ence was called, and tho meeting
found him ready to "talk turkey."
Tho negotiations proceeded rapidly,
with tho understanding that tho
United Stnttvs meant to press tho op
portunlty to clean up Northern
Mexico, and when tho meeting ended
a tentative arrangement had been
agreed upon, subject to olllelal up

Major John Mcllrldo was found guilty
of trenson and shot thcro yesterday
morning.
Two others. Thomas Hunter nnd
William Cosgrave, wcro also found
guilty and sentenced to death, but
the General commanding tho mHttaryf-'
forces In Ireland commuted tholr sen
tences to llfo Imprisonment.
Thero was llttlo prospect of morcy
for Mnjor McBrldo. Onco before, when
tho Boors rebelled In South Africa, ho
fought against tha authority pf Great
Britain.
James M. Sullivan, former Ameri
can Minister to the Dominican Ho-
publlc, who has been Imprisoned In
Dublin Castle for several days on tho
charge of having been Implicated In
the Irish rebellion, probably will bo j
released to-day, It Is said by officials.
Edward L. Adams, American Con
sul In Dublin, was active In behalf of
Mr. Sullivan. IIo mado several trips
to tho castle and held conferences
with high ofllclals. The present fa- ,
vnrable attitude of these ofllclals ap-
parently Is duo to the efforts or .Mr.
Adams.
Majr John McBrldo fought through
out tho Boer War with tho Irish
Brigade under Gen. Plot Joubert.
When tho Boers finally surrendered
ho mado his escape and took refugo
In Paris, where ho later married Miss
Maud Gonne, known In Homo Bulo
circles In Ireland as tho Irish Joan
of Arc. In 1003 Major and Mrs. Mc
llrldo delivered a series of lectures In
thn United .States on Irish politics.
On their return to Paris Mrs, McBrldo
sued for dlvorco nnd was granted n
legal separation.
It might be said of Major Mcllrldu
that ho waH a born revolutionist. Hu
was born In Wostport, County Mayo,
forty-six years ngo, of a father who
was an ardent Irish patriot and ho
was i eared In an atmosphere of re
volt. His Immediate relations, thu
Gallaghers anil tho Gills especially,
were aetlvo In Irish movements and
many wero driven from Ireland at
tho tnno of the rising of '67.
At tho opening of the war ho was
a mining engineer In South Africa
and organized the Irish Brlgado in
Johannesburg. When the Boer rebels
were granted amnesty McBrldo, who
hail been In exile for several years,
went to Iondon and from there to

By Carl W.
BERLIN, May 6 United Press.
to-day the Importance of the peace

has a great corfjnjty to bring thwao an eariynd. Some mH
frrert suggested that the time is now npefor Col. Hou to reylQi1

I he German reply contained the following reference to peace:

Chancellor von Bethmann-IIollweg,' Foreign Secretary von Jagow,
Dr. Hclffericli, Minister of Finance, Admiral Capelle, successor to Grand
Admiral von Tirpit;, and several others spoke at a secret session of the
Reichstag committee at which the note and the reasons that prompted the
Government to take this course were fully explained.
AMSTERDAM, Holland, May 6 (via London). Despatches re
ceived here from Berlin say the note to the United States was written by
l-mperor William.
WASHINGTON, May 6. President Wilson read to-day with care
ful attention the portion of (lie note touching on peace. Some officials be
lieved unusual significance should be attached to that part of the note, be
cause it was taken to indicate officially
von Bethmann-IIollweg before the Reiclistag were intended as notices to
the world that Germany was ready for peace on certain terms.
While it was indicated that President Wilson would make no further
peace moves until the allied Governments have signified their willingness
to receive suggestions on the subject, some officials thought to-day tfie
German note might possibly draw forth something from the allies.
Concessions by Great Britain on points of dispute between England
nnd tho United StuteH wero also discussed to-day. The relaxation of tha
British blockado announced by Lord Itobert Cecil nlmost coincident with
the yielding of Germany on tho submarine issuu wns regarded aa sig
nificant. yigr. Iloiunnn, Apostolic Delegate to Washington, called to.
