Washington Officials "vonsider Incident Closed German
Press and People Pleased With Reply and Hopeful It
C Would Be Satisfactory to Americans Matter Can Only
Come Up Again If Germany Renews Submarine War On
Merchantmen English Blockade To Be Tackled Next
! ! . By Robert J. Bender.
(United Press Staff Correspondent.) .
Washington, May 6. The submarine issue is closed, in
the view of President Wilson's advisers today. No com
ment was forthcoming from the White House. So com
pletely do officials in touch with the situation consider the
issue disposed of that it was
by the president.
Secretary Lansing may issue a statement calling atten-
.tion to the essential point that Germany ordered its sub
marine activities confined to vessels of war. This is the
essence of the reply, officials say, and leaves no actual
issues.
The issue will remain closed, it is believed. It is felt
that Germany will not reopen the case by resuming its un
dersea warfare akainst merchantmen. Officials believe
every care will be taken to prevent commanders from vio
lating their instructions, and see danger only in the fact
that the submarine commanders are mostly young and
some of them perhaps difficult to control.
But Germany having once quit submarining merchant
men, no high official regards it within the range of pos
sibility that she will resume such operations.

pence feature contained in the German
reply to the American submarine note,
They exprssod the belief that Ptesi-
dent Wilson has a great opportunity
to bring the war to ;in early end.
Some person even suggested that the
lime wns now ripe for Colonel House
' to again visit the Kuropean capitals.
Newspapers here praised the Ger
man reply and expressed hope that it
would witinl'y President Wilson and
the Americans. There were no adveise
editorials.
Newspapers admitted th.it Great
Biitain .would vigorously oppose the
effort by the United States to curtail
its bloclinde of the central empires. It
was pointed out that the blockade is
as valuable to Great Britain as the sub
marine v to Germany, and that it will
require .in unusual pressure from Amer
ica to force Hie British to a strict
riiiiiplinnce with international law.
The Tngehlntt repressed a hope that
the note would accomplish its purpose.
The Lokal Anxeiger hopes that it would
Mitisfv the Americans and congress,
even if it did not satisfy Wilson.
The Vossiehe Ziotung emphasized the
charge that Wilson is one sidedly uou
1r.il and added that Germany had made
.-in honest and earnest endeavor to
avoid a break.

The only paragraph satisfactory to
London was Germany's declaration
that concessions made wouM prevent

seized upon this as an admission that
Germany is highly alarmed over the
possible effects of America's entrance
into the war on the side of the allies.
The Post and the Chronicle agreed

matium Agreement To Be
Signed Today
Washington, May 0. South
America bus tiie greatest con
fidence in the good faith of the
United States toward Mexico.
Any action taken will be receiv
ed without question there.
This was the statement today
of Senator Fletcher, returning
from South America.
"South America," he said,
"thinks that the p.itient course
of the United States toward
Mexico is ample proof that it
doesu 't seek to dominate all
the Americas. Many South
Americans feel that we have
gone as far as we can to save
Mexico from itself, and that .ill
we can do now is to withdraw
or intervene. Hither course
would not be disapproved."

El Paso. Ttxas, May (I. General
Hugh Scott expect, to sign todnv th
agreement which he entered into with
General Alvaro Obregon covering the
operations of American troops in Mex
ico. Whatever obstacles prevented
Obregon from signing yesterd.iv are
believed to have been overcome today
and it was expected he would meet
Scott iu a final conference without fur
ther hesitation.
Obregon declared that his message
from Carranza were garbled and that
this prevented the sea ling of the agree
ment. Officials did not credit this,
however, asserting that Carranza prob
ably hoped the German reply would af
fect the situation.
Circumstantial accounts today re
vealed an interesting phase of the pre
liminaries. Scott sent O. P. Brown,
agent of the war department, to .luirez
to "throw tin fear of God into the
Mexicans' hearts," before the first
conference, according to these reports,
Brown failed to find Obregon but con
ferred with General Gavira and Cou
sul Garcia, giving them Scott mes
sage. He communicated a warning
that the United States would no longer
tolerite anarchy in Mexico and that
if the Mexicans continued their atti
tude of nssertiveness anil defiance, the
next two venrs would be blacker than
lSlli und IH47.
Despite this, Obregon made a sweep
ing demand in the tirst conference, it
was learned, issuing a virtual ultima
tum for the withdrawal of American
troops from Mexico. Scott's attitude
was effective, and iu the second con
ference Obregon was ready to "talk
turkey."
Negotiations proceeded rapidly with
the understanding that tiie United
Stutes forces would quickly clean up
northern Mexico,
Heports from Mexicans who assert
that Francisco Villa is near Knntingo
I'appusqniuro, Durango, H00 miles from
the border, ami i)00 miles south of the
American untwists, did not agree with
General Pershing's advices.

ENGLAND TOO YIELDS
TO WILSON'S DEMANDS
Washington, May (1. Conces
sions by Great Britain iu dis
putes with this country were
much discussed today. The re
luxation of the British blockade
announced by Lord Cecil almost
coincident with the yielding by
Germany iu the submarine crisis
was regarded as significant.
At the same time it wns of
ficially announced that Great
Britain had yielded to Presi
dent Wilson's demands for the
release of Germans and Aus
trian taken from the American
liner Chinn on the high seas. As
a result it was pointed out that
the ruling affects several other
, blockade orders which must be
abrogated. This was regarded
as a hopeful peace sign.

Pope Asks President
To Aid In Bringing
the War To An End
Washington, May 6. A long com.
munication to President Wilson from
the pope urging the president to mak
strong efforts to keep America out of
the war wns delivered today at the
White House by Monsignor BOuzauo,
apostolic delegate.
His mission-was most confidential. No
word of the details of his purpose were
forthcoming from the White House.
But it was ascertained the pope feels
he must have the cooperation of Presi
dent. Wilson in order to bring an end
to the war. .
It is understood that the '''peace
paragraphs" in the Oerman reply were
rtrerrca to in the communication. This
papal communication, in connection
with tho reply and receipt of dis
patches from Europe announcing furth
er activity of the pope with certain
German dignitaries for the apparent
purpose of paving the way for peace
caused a Rreat stir in officialdom.
Pea:o talk took precedence over tho
German-American situation.

Not Up To Their Traditions,

Seattle, Wash., May 0. "The Eng
lish are a decadent race, and the knell
hns sounded for them as a great na

hospital service of northern France, Dr.
Waldon Hicli'irdson, an American surg
eon, has just returned to Seattle with
thut firm conviction.
"T went to Europe decidedly pro
British," he declared, "but I have come
back virtually neutral.
"I saw eiioush at the front, in the

"As fighting men, chcy have not

officially admitted today.
The Oerninn attack was The most de

massed batteries of heavy calibre guns

HOPES OFPEACEFOUND
N STATEMENT IN REPLY
This Plainly Indicates Germany Is Amious For PeaceIt
Says "Germany Has Twice Oifered to Make Peace" and
That She Yields Because She Believes Prolongation of
the War a Calamity These Are Taken to Mean An Ap
peal to This Country to Take Steps That Fill Step
the Carnage
By Robert J. Bender,
(United Press Staff Correspondent.)
Washington,. May 6. The official text of Germany's
reply to the American submarine ultimatum was received
here today and President is formulating his decision on
the momentous issue.
Unless the official document differs seriously from the
press version it is a foregone conclusion that danger of an
immediate break has passed. This conclusion has the gen
eral approval of congress, the cabinet and others of the
president's advisers.
From the large numbers of telegrams received at the
White House during the night it appears that the country
is satisfied that Germany made a concession precluding all
possibility of a break unless it fails to live Up to its
promise.
Germany may be said to be again on probation. Time
will tell whether it deserves this chance, according to the
view here.
With President Wilson's decision, the Lusitania case
will pass into history. The last obstacle in the Lusitania
negotiations will be removed when the president approves
the new orders putting freighters and liners in the same
class all subject to the rules of search and seizure before
destruction.
Officials guardedly indicated that something may re
sult directly from Germany's plain indication that it is
anxious for peace.
The conference between Ambassador Gerard and the
kaiser suddenly looms large in the minds of officials. It
had not been seriously thought that the emperor discussed
details of the submarine issue with Gerard. Since the ar
rival of the reply there is a strong belief that peace may
have played a promnient part in the conference.
Germany's nilniission that she twice
offered to make eaco ami a declara
tion that she yields, because she be
lieves prolongation of the war a ca
lamity, these if not actual indications
of Apprehension for the future are ap
peals to this country lor aiiiruiiHue
steps that will stop' the carnnge, ac
cording to belief of German as well ns
administration, circles.
It. mnv bo snid authoritatively that
some persons close to the president be
litve he should tentatively sound out
the belligerents on the question of
possible peace ami result of the Germ in
note.
One of these said: "We hear in this
no voice of the braggart or the bully
but the voice of a nation sick anil tired
of the endless fight. It is the heart
ami soul of Germany spcukiug whut it
feels."
The .president for more than n year

ward peace. I'ntil such iction is sug -
gesteil to him by a belligerent, it is
believed he will make no move. This
suggestion, in the minds of many, has
como. Whether the presilent will so
regard it remains to lie seen.
Much probably depends on what
Ambassador Gerard communicuted with
regard to his conference with the kais
er. The contents of his communica
tion on that point lire closely gnnrded.
In the meintime the president will
not, act in this direction until ho hns
