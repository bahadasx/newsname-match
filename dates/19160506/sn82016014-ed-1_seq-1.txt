When the case was called for trial, a
demurrer was sustained and judgment
entered for the defendant.
It was held by the court that the

More Compensation Oases.
The supreme court clarified some
of the legal muddle surrounding in
terpretations of the workmen's com
pensation act when it today passed on
three cases involving the big labor
law.
In a suit by S. O. Gailey against
the Beet Brothers' Manufacturing com
pany of Wyandotte county, the court
held that an employee who was par
tially disabled through injury does not
lose his right under the compensation
law though he remain in the employ
of the company. Another case was
that of J. H. Ruth against the With-erspoon-Englar
company. in which
the supreme court reversed the action
of the Wyandotte county district court.
In this case the court held an em
ployee was entitled to injuries which
he received in connection with his
work, but was not entitled to compen
sation for alleged malpractice of sur
geons employed by the defendant com
pany. A third case was that of Albert
W. Taylor against the Sulzberger &
Sons company. also of Wyandotte
county. The court in this case held
tha a son could not collect compen
sation for the death of his mother,
even though she contributed to his
support. The woman lived with her
son, who was head of a household of
a wife and child. The mother lived
with them, contributed to the mainte
nance of the home, but was not re
garded as a member of tb family.
Horse-, Cows and Chickens Exempt.
When A man keeps a horse, a cow or
chickens in his bam. he is not violat
ing the city health ordinance unless he
persists In depositing refuse In places
that make such an act dangerous to
health or welfare of a community.
That was the decree of the supreme
court today in a case testing the val
idity of an ordinance of the city of
Goodlnnd, Sherman county.
L- W. Popejoy brought suit to test
the Goodland ordinance. The court
held that the ordinance which pro
hibited depositing of cans, manure,
ashes and garbage on property of citi
zens was invalid because the town
council did not state whether the de
posit was a nocuous or innocuous de
posit. Enforcement of the ordinance
would prohibit the keeping of a cow,
horse or chickens in a barn, regard-
less of the cleanliness of the barn.
Iecides Old Case.
The supreme court today decided a
sixty-year-old case when it gave to the
J. W. Stark estate of Kansas City,
property which they had obtained
through accretions. The accretion
came with a flood in 1867 when there
was an ice gorge in the Kaw river.
The land was claimed to have been
taken from Howe's island and title was
claimed by Hunter M. Meriweather.
Suits concerning accretions from the
flood and ice gorge of 1867 have for
years been in the state and United
States courts. The decision today
gives the land to the Stark .estate.

Washington. May 6. The sub

and Germany is closed. This is the
view of President Wilson'sadvisers with

the American demands in hand. The
president himself received the official
text today but the White House with
held comment.
So completely do officials in touch
with the situation consider the issue
disposed of. it is said, there will be no
reply by the president to the German
note. There may be a statement by
Secretary Lansing, however, calling
attention to the essential point In the
note that Germany has ordered sub
marine attacks confined to vessels of
war. This is the essence of the kaiser's
reply, officials say, and leaves no
actual issue with-Germany.
The issue will remain closed, of
ficials believe. They feel Germany
will not reopen it hy resuming warfare

Savages Battle With W'
Again This Afternoon
Both Teams Fight Hard to Get
the Jump.
Wichita, Kan., May 6. A crowd of
1,200 turned out this afternoon to see
the Topeka Savages battle with the
Wolves in the third game of their
series,. As each team had one game
to its credit the contest today was
made more interesting by the fact that
both were striving for the rubber hon
ors. Manager Lattimore announced his
battery as consisting of Lambeth and
Monroe, and Pate took the mound for
Wichita with Gray on the receiving
end. The game started at 3:15.
Pursuing their tactics of Friday, the
Savages again began the battle with a
bombardment and scored two runs
before they were retired in the first
inning. Goodwin was the first man to
get on, earning his title to the path
with ft clean single. Tydeman then
followed with a doubl o rr?ht -center,
; scaring Goodwin." Tyden&an.
scored a few minutes later or. Britton's
bobble. Lambeth held the Wolves
scoreless in the first inning.
The scoring was continued in the
second inning, Topeka getting two
more and Wichita opening her end of
the score board with one. The Sav
ages "knocked Pate from the box and
Durham, the apothecary pitcher, re
placed him.
Schweitzer was the first man to ret
on for Topeka in the second. He was
given a walk. Monroe then sacrificed
and Lambeth s doubled. scoring
Schweitzer. Agler got a double on a
low liner to center, and Cochran sin
gled to third. Lam bet tried tG score
but was cut down at the plate. Ag
Ier and Cochran then worked a double
steal, Agler scoring. Cochran was
then out trying to score.
The Wolves came to bat and filled
the bases on a double, a single and a
walk. They put one score over on a
sacrifice fly but a double play pulled
by Lattimore, Cochran and Agler re
tired them.
Goodwin scored another for the
fighting Savages in the third. He led
off with a single and Tydeman beat
out a bunt to third and Kruger sac
rificed. Lattimore grounded out, but
Schweitzer hit one to the pitcher that
was too hot to handle arid Goodwin
crossed the home plate rubber. Tyde
man was caught at the plate, trying to
work a double steal. The Wolves
were unable to count in the third.
The Savages were determined to
take no chances on a low score win
ning and continued to pile up runs,
making two in the fourth. Lambeth
singled. Agler doubled and both scored
when Jackson dropped Goodwin's line
drive. Lambfth continued to pitch
good ball and held the Wolves count
less in their half of the fourth.

'RECALLS VISIT WITH EMPEROR
Peace Proposal May Have Been
Imparted to Gerard.
Wilson Has Awaited Sugges
tion From Some Belligerent.
Washington, May 6. Overshadow
ing in many minds the question of
the president's acceptance of the Ger
man reply is interest in the small par
agraph in the heart of the German
note relating to peace. When t he
preeiden replies to Germany this
paragraph may or may not be
touched upon. Nevertheless, officials
today in guarded manner intimated
frankly that something may result di
rectly from Germany's plain indica
tion that she is anxious for peace.
The conference between Ambassa
dor Gerard and the kaiser suddenly
looms large in the minds of officials
here. It never had been seriously
thought that the emperor discussed
details of the submarine issue with
the American ambassador. Since the
arrival here of the German note, the
belief has grown strong that peace
may have played a prominent part in
that conference.
Doesn't Want War Prolonged.. .
Germany's admission that she has
twice offered to make peace, her
declaration that she yields to the
president's demands because she be
lieves it would be a calamity if the
war were prolonged or increased in
scope these decisions, if not actual
i indications of uneasiness over the fu
ture, are at least appeals to this coun
try for formative ateps that will stop
the carnage, according to the ex
pressed belief In German circles as
well as in administration quarters.
. It may be-aaid with certainty that
some of those close to the president
il teller he should and may tentatively
sound out the warring powers on the
question oi a possible peace as a re
sult of the German note. One of these
men said today:
Nation Sick of Conquest.
"We hear in this the German re
ply) not the voice of the braggart or
buly but the voice of a nation sick
and tired of the endless fight. It is
the heart and soul of Germany speak
ing what it feels.
"From all the countries) at war Tfe
read every day of some indication tht
the conflict is becoming an intolerable
burden. Perhaps this is the time to
move for the end."
The president has for more than a
year declined to volunteer his services
in the cause of peace. Until such ac
tion was suggested to him by one of
the countries fighting, it has been un
derstood he would make no move.
This suggestion in the minds of many
here is that time ha? now come.
Whether or not the president regards
it In this light remains to be seen.
With the official text of the German
reply before him today. President
Wilson is formulating his decision on
whether or not Germany has mt
American squarely on the submarine
issue.
