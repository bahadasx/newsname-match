and that an inerense would fall on
the dear public, and in the second

of the railway employee and says.
"If the englnemen would demand
that their haul, on tonnaRC. In
cut down and more trains opn ra

demand for increase, but would
facilitate the handling of freight.
Qood, Bttt where would the
dear public come in on that leal'.'
This would necessitate additional
trains and train crews, would ti t
it? Who would pay themV

to demand an increase and there
by forestall any posftbilllty ol
other employee securing any In
crease?" The pay received by the train
men has. and will have, absolutely
nothing to do with the unorgan
ised workers. No class of work
ers will receive more of the pro
duct! Of their labor THAN THEY
ARE ABLE TO T.VKK. If the de
mands of the trainmen are grant
ed, it will b? because of their or
ganised strength leinir so power
ful that even a capitalist govern
ment will fear to combat it with
its injunction courts, police and
army. The poorer paid laborers
can hope for nothing unless they
organize and put themselves in a
petition to DEMAND.
However, since you are so much
concerned about the difference in
the pay of the trainmen and th
section men. why do you stop
then? why not also consider In
difference in pay between the
trainmen anu the higher officials
who contribute littl" or no service
toward railroad operation, but
put in their time cambliiui on tin
stock market and wrecking mi'
wnvs? They take from .t-.i0.000 to
SlliODOO per year each in sala

pays that, if not the dear public-.

editors lament abo it any lncrea3

is it because of that bi-et.ni ii an

Then here Is another picture.
At every county seat there is
court hous" occupied by men of
more or less ability generally
less. These men draw fabulo.uo
pay when compared with the
earnings of those who pay th
taxes Scott county is of less
than average population, but wll1
take it as ati illustration
Very few, if any. or the men in
office could command a salary of
s 000 per year at any other Job.
Yet they take from the d i r pub
lic anywhere from $1,800 (fo -.-
500 In addition to this the dear
public must furnish office room,
furniture, supplies, heat, water
and a Janitor .u clean up for
them Why does ye editor shed
no tears on behalf of the dear
public over this? Is it because
these officials have a little pub
lic printing to let out?
It seems that the only time
when the Interests of the dear
public becomes an issue is when
the useful workers want a great
er share of their earnings. So
"long as the useless parasites get
it, all is well with the dear public.
Read the following, which is the
other side of the question, as put
out by tbe men who do the work,
an d see where the dear public
gets it in the neck :
Cleveland. A statement issued
by the Railroad Transportation
Brotherhood directs attention to
the practice of railroads in grant
ing rebates to shippers, hauling
private cars, etc.
If the railroads are really nil
cere in desiring to conserve their
revenue, a recent report or the
interstate commerce commission i
BhoWS the Vonds how they wouH
save millions of dollars which
they lose through hauling of pri
vate cars and the granting of re
bates. This is Important In connection
with the highly exaggerated esti
mates which the railways are
l anding out to the public as to
the cost of the carriers or tin
adoption of the eight-hour Work
day in freight train service,
More than enough money Is
wnisted by inef f icient operation
to make up the comparatively
small sum it might cost the roads
to better the working condition
or its employes.
It is commonly suppose d that
rebating has been brought to nn
end. but the records of fines im
m sed uion the railroads show
that this unlawful practice has
not yet been stopped, Not onl.v
do the railroads lose revenue by
granting rebates but the rines
Imposed ire wry considerable,
It is reasonable to suppose that
only a small percentage r the
actual rebating is discovered by
the authorities.

tin- carriers amounted to -.'i-i.-

state will provide these on thi
theory that they are essential ti

RAISING THE BOTTOM
By Arthur Brooks Baker.
Fifty years ago, If there was n
stagnant pool in a pauper's back
yard, nobody cared. Today It is
a matter of grave public interest.
It la not that anybody loves the
pauper, but the rest of us are vi
tally concerned with our own pre
cious health, and we have learned
that pools breed disease.
We are Just beginning to lenrn
that paupers also breed disease.
We are beginning to think about
the moral and physical condition
of our fellow beings, not because
we are required to save their
souls nor because
we care one
penny about their welfare, but
because the general social health
protects us.
The "mud sills of sneictv" sent
up their prayers and curses In I
vain for thousands of years; no
body cared. Then, suddenly, an
enlightened world found that
they were sending up among us
'better classes" not only petitions
and maledictions, but microbes
and bacilla of disease.
