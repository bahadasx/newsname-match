GERMANY MOST
Cologne Gazette Says 'We
All Know That Germany's
Back Will Be Broken"
If She Loses.
Amsterdam, May 0, via London,
12:45 p. m The Cologne Gazette
commenlng on the note says:
"We really have sufficient enemies
and our enemies do not make it easy
for us to beat them. We all know
that Germany's back will be broken, if
we do not win this war. That is why
all other thoughts ought to be brush
ed aside and why only reasonable
ones ought to be entertained.
"We must, therefore, avoid diffi
culties which might bring about war
with America and leave upon Presi
dent Wilson responsibility for such a
catastrophe if he wants it All the
same, we believe that the emperor
and his counsellors had no alterna
tive, than to make the answer they
sent. It must have been hard for
them and we must swallow our legi
timate wrath. Wo can do it as our
way does not lead to Canossa, but
allows of a peaceful outcome on the
basis sot forth by President Wil
son." Dispatches received i ere from Ber
lin say the note was written entire
ly by Emperor William. His Majesty
Dr. Von Bethmann-Hollwog, the im
perial chancellor; Dr. Karl Helffe

ury, and James W. Gorard, tho Amer

GALLANT DEEDS
OF CANADIANS
Men Cling to Trenches Undis
mayed by Violent Gun Fire
Ottawa, May C. Many deeds of
gallantry in the face of furious Ger
man attacks upon the Canadian lines
in France are recounted in a dispatch
from Canadian headquarters.
"At one point," the account said,
"the enemy directed the fire of many
guns and mortars into the trenches
of a western cavalry battalion. Be
tween 2 and 6 o'clock in the after,
noon over two thousand shells wero
flung into this area. Undismayed by
the intensity of tho fire, our men
clung to their trenches, and held on
even to the most advanced positions.
Opposite to them the fierce retaliation
of our artillery was wrecking tho
German trenches and there Is little
doubt but that the stubborn tenacity
of the battalion, coupled with the
splendid work of the artillery, pre
vented the delivery of an Impending
attack.
"Later In the week the battalion was
complimented by the commander-in-chief
in person on Its steadiness under
this trying ordeal. During the bom
bardment a large shell pitched into a
trench close to one of our machine
guns. It crashed through the first
stop. Instantly, Lance Corporal John
Peacey of Vancouver, rushed forward,
picked up the heavy missile and threw
it out of the trench. As it cleared
the parapet It exploded in theair. But
for Corporal Peacey's gallantry, the
machine gun must have been shat
tered and its crew almost certainly
annihilated."
