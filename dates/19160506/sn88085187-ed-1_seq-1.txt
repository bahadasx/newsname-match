WILSON ACCEPTS ASSURANCES
BUREAU OF CLUB
WILL UNDERTAKE
BUILDING SURVEY
The Tacoma Commercial club is ready today to
undertake The Times' program to "Build This City
Up Right."
The Times' editorial yesterday, suggesting that a
building and housing survey of the city be made by
a committee of the re-organized club, to stimulate
the sort oi buildings that will be of most value to the
city as a whole, met with hearty response from the
club officers and trustees.
"Will the club take it up?" was the question The
Times asked.
Dr. L. L. Love, chairman of the civic bureau, an
swered immediately with the announcement that his
bureau WILL take the suggestion up at once and
get busy.
"Your plan is all right," he said. "It is just what
the city needs.
"It means a big job, but no proposition is too big
for the re-organized Commercial club to handle."
Tlie civic bureau already lias a
building I'oninilttee In the Held,
Dr. l.ove said, and this commit
tee may he tlie one delegated to
handle the survey work.
•'The civil* bureau appreciated
The Times' suggestion," he ad
ded. "'We propose to work along
the line suggested. And if ,ou
have any further ones to offer we
will react In any way we can.''
Or. Ernest ('. Wheeler, presi
dent of the club, was equally en
thusiastic over the plan.
"It Is a fine thing," he said,
"and will mean a great deal to
the cily. 1 am glad you have
taken it up, and the club will do
all it can to co-operate."
Suggests Special < oiniiiiltee,
"Probably the greatest signs
of promise for Tacoma are the
building permits, which show a
300 per cent Increase over a year
»_o," whs the statement of Ste
phen 11, Collins, one of the dun's
trustees.
"As reorganized, the Commer
cial club is democratic in char
acter antl ■■linulil be a great force
In stimulating building of the
right kind in the city.
"The suggestion for n building
and housing survey of the city
should be referred to the mem
bers' council of the Commercial
club, which should place It In the
hands of a special committee for
action. The plan Is a good one,
and that is the place for it. There
is no doubt of its being a third
which the city needs for its pro
per upbuilding."
Mayor Likes It.
"The plan is all right; you
have Just the idea," was Mayor
Fawcett's comment. "What we
need Is to gel some regularity
• bout the buildings here that
would make them look better."
"1 think the suggestion is a
good one, especially if we can
get the right kind of men behind
such a survey," was the opinion
of Everett G. Griggs.
Watch Tacoma Orow.
A number of the club trustees
have sent letters to The Times,
