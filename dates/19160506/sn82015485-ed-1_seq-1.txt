TESTIMONY OF THOSE WHO DO
BUSINESS WITH BENTON
.. It H to be inferred from reading the
columns or the Norton Daily Tele
graui, (Congressman Connelly's Dem
ocratic organ,) that it Is opposed to
the candidacy of Otis I. Benton.
Hardly an issue comes put that does
not contain' some arfciele intended to
be derogatory to Mr. Benton. Yet in
all t he-waste of -words the Telegram,
has never yet produced. a single argu
ment cr fact that could in any way
discredit Mr. Benton in the estimat
ion of the thinkior people. The prin
cipal grievance against Ml. Benton,
seem to be that he is a bswrr and.
collects interest on the. Blooey; "be
loan, also that be is spending some
money on his campaign. Tke-cwoclus-
ion to be drawn is that Mr Saaiers
gives his services, trratis, ca che Tele.-
gram and is -working mereiy for h
love of the game, - since, he finds so
mucn to complain of in the Tact that
tr. Benton charges interest tex the
use of his money. U Is true that Mr A
Benton charges interest, so do .all
other men who loan money or give ser
vice, of any kind. By honest effort,
perseverance and careful lnvestmei. 2,
Mc Beaton has accumulated abm-
fortabie fortune, aid it. is only Ju3
that jne should receire : j ust 'Wttfpcor
satlsh from 'those who use bis money.
Another thing that the Telegram
seems to have overlooked, Is that Mr.
Benton was loaning money in Decatur
county to carry farmers thru years
when ether bankers were mighty
conserative about tbeir 'loans and
and when he was not very sure about
getting any interest. To enlighteen
the Telegram regarding Mr. Benton's
standing among those who pay him
interest, we recite a conversation
that took place less than ten days ago.
A gentleman in talking to us said:
"I have, at home a pile of checks four
inches high that represent monev
paid to Otis L. Benton for principal
and interest, yet I think enough of
him to be out putting forth every
effort I can to secure his nomination.
He had all the opportunity he wanted
to close down on me in years 'when
money .was scarce and it was hard to
pay bat he encouraged me to keep on
working, saying that be would see me

some money in his" campaign. So will
every other candidate. The present

But to infer that he is buying his

MARKET REPORT
Kansas City Stock Yards, May 2, 1916.
The cattle market struck a rough
place todav, due to too .many in sight
for tomorrow - at. -Chicago. Receipts
here was 8700 head, and steers sold
slowly, at steady to 10 lower prices;
cows and stockers and feeders steady.
The feature this week has been the
large supply of good to choice pulp fed
steers from Colorado, these cattle
being about the best offered, and
selling largely at $8.95 to $9.40.
Prime native steers are quotable up
to $9.65, some yearlings today at $9.50,
bulk of the beef steers $8.50 to $9.25,
plain steers and rtogies $8 to $.50, a
few common steers to killers down to
$7.50, these later selling at compara
tively high prices as compared to
steers worth intrinsically much more.
The quest for cheap beef keeps cows
at a high figure, prime heavy cows up
to $3.50. bulk of the cows $0.50 to SS.OO.
Far loads of good light weight quar
antine steers arrived today, 1162 lbs
at $3.90. " Stockers and feeders find
quick outlet at the highest level of
the year, useful stock steers at $7.35,
well bred Shorthorns of all weights
around $8, choice White Faces $8.25 to
$8.50, fancy calves $9, stock cows
$6.2o to $6. i a, breeding heifers $7.50
to $8.00, choice light weight high
er, chaxacter of the . cattle . supply
indicates an early exhaustion of the
main supply ' sources now furnishing
cattle here,' which means scarcity and
strong prices balance of this month
at least.
Hog receipts were 16000 today,
market 5 lower, after threats of a
greater decline which came to noth
ing. Demand .is strong, especially
from packers, who need bogs for both
meat and lard. Packers cannot deny
that bogs are killing out at a profit,
as per provisions quotations, which
means that the market is on a sound
foundation. , .'- Top? price today .-.was
