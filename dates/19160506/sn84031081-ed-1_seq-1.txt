message! between General Alvuro
Obregon and Gen. Venustlano Carran
2a over the tentative agreement for
American and Mexican co-operation
in the scattering of Villa bandits have
been completed, it was said tonight.
It Is expected that General Obregon
will hold his next conference with
General Scott tomorrow on the Amer
ican side of the Kio Grande and that
a. protocol covering the agreement
will then be drawn up.
Carranza Obstinate.
It had been the expectation of Gen
erals Scott and Funston that the final
meeting with General Obregon would
take place toduy. At the last mo
ment, however. It was learned that
General Carranza still held to the
opinion that the American troopg
Hhoould set-a definite and early date
for withdrawal. It was eaid that a
large part of today was spent by the
Mexican officials here in convincing
the first chief that the tentative
agreement should be adhered to in the
main.
Some Other Plfforenecs.
It Is asserted, however, tnat there
are still a few details not yet assent
ed to by General Carranza and that
these will have to be threshed out at
the next meeting between Generals
Scott and Obregon. Personsa in
position to know ay that the matters
in dispute are so inconsequential that
they are bound to be adjusted.

Washington, May 5. Publication of
the text of the Scott-Obrcgon agree

bandits In Mexico still awaited formal
notification tonight that it has. been
approved by General Carranza. Pres
ident Wilson will make it public as
foon as word of its acceptance by the
de facto government reached him
either from Mexico City direct or
from General Scott at El Paso.
The war department had nothing
"lore than routine reports from the
border. Secretary Baker, however,
"aid unofficial advices seemed to in
dicate a better feeling among the
Mexicans since the military confer
ence was arranged. General Scott is
expected to return to Washington as
soon as he has exchanged acceptances
t the agreement with General Obre

Ported that rail communication be
tween Vera Cruz and Mexico City had
leen interrupted since May 1. No ex
planation was given. Other reports

various parts of Mexico heard from.
, Pending its publication the Scott-
Ubregon agreement is being closely I
suaroea. Only Secretary Baker and
his Immediate advisers In the war de
partment and Secretary Lansing and
a few state department officials have
en It. Secretary Baker reiterated
today that all information given out
concerning the agreement would come

A long detailed account of his dis

the consequences resulting therefrom.
