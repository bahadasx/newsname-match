OFFICIAL GERMAN ANSWER
AVERTS BREAK, AT LEAST
FOR THE PRESENT, IS CLAIM
Diplomatic Split With Berlin
Is Believed Now to Be
Less Probable.
TEXT VARIES LITTLE
Communication Has No Ma
terial Difference Prom
Unofficial Paper.
Washincton. Mav 6-The nfn.
cial text of Germany's note fully
decoded and laid before President
Wilson today shows no material
differences from the unofficial text
published yesterday in news dis
patches. This strengJiens the
probability that a diplomatic break
has been averted, at least for the
present.
Overnight study of the note by offi
cials did not change their view that
mere would tie no break in diplo
matic relations unless there were
further attacks in violation o? inter
national law.
There is a possibility that the Unit
ed States may notify the Berlin gov
ernment that as long as the new
orders to submarine commanders are
fully observed diplomatic relations
will not be discontinued on that
score.
Secretary Lansing already has
studied the note once and was going
over it very carefully again today.
There were indications that further
consideration by the cabinet would not
be necessary.
Bernstorff Returns.
Count von Bernstorff, the German
ambassador, returned to the embassy
today from New York. He said he
had no communication from his gov
eminent and had no reason to visit
the state department. The embassy
view that the note was all the United
States asked, remained unchanged.
beveral members of the cabinet
have left Washington and are not ex
pected back before Monday. Secretary
Lansing has gone to Annapolis for
the Wfiflv pnrl. Sprrptarv Ratror i'r in
Cleveland and Postmaster General
f Burleson is on a short fishing trip.
President Studies Note-
President Wilson read today with
careful attention the portion of the
note touching on peace. Some officials
believed much significance should be
attached to that part of the note be
cause it was taken to indicate offi
cially that recent speeches of Chan
cellor von Bethmann-Hollweg before
the reichstag were intended as no
tices to the world that Germany was
ready for peace on certain terms.
The note says "The German govern
ment, conscious of Germany's strength,
twice within the last few months an
nounced before the world its readi
ness to make peace on a basis safe
guarding Germany's vital interests."
"ote failed Peace Hope.
London, May 6. The Daily News
gives a prominent place in today's is
sue to a long dispatch from Rotter
dam, asserting that there is a strong
belief in Holland that the German note
to the United States was carefully pre
pared in the hope that it may lead
eventually to peace negotiations. The
dispatch says it may lead eventually
to peace negotiations. The dispatch
says jn part:
"There is a belief here that behind
the whole cloud of vague and condi
tional promises lies the hope that ne
gotiations for peace will be opened
with England through the mediation
of the United States. Germany hopes
that Washington will open a discussion
on the naval blockade which will wid
en by easy stages to eventual discus
sion of possible peace conditions."
Gerard Holding Hand.
The Daily News' correspondent also
says that the Wolff Bureau sent out
an article this week in which an anon
ymous neutral discusses the relations
between Germany and the United
States and suggests that Ambassador
Gerard now has an opportunity to lay
the foundations for peace negotia
tions. This article appeared in the
same issue of the German newspapers
with the text of the reply to the Amer
ican note. It says:
"This appears to be the historic
opportunity for America. If the Unit
ed States maintains an equally firm
Position against the starvation of Ger
many as against the German subma
rine warfare, then there will be an
opening for the belligerents to con
sider how they may end this miserable ,

the French artillery and that the
fresh troops the German crown

the death penalty being Major

Boy Admits
Killing Parent
Portsmouth, O., May 6. George
Jourdan, 8, who told officials Wednes
day that his father, Roy Jordan, killed
his mother with a shotgun following a
quarrel because she did not get up
early enough to get breakfast, has
confessed that he shot his mother, of

questions, when Fred, in innocence
and with a pointing hand said:
"George, what did you kill my mamma
for?"
George hung his head and failed to
answer. The officials were quick to
ask Fred how George killed his mother
and the little chap said: "George killed
her with a gun."
The 8-year-old lad then said that he
was playing with the shotgun and did
not know it was loaded. He pulled
the trigger back and the contents of
the gun were discharged into his moth
er's head.
Neighbors found the body of Mrs.
Jordan Tuesday afternoon. Four sons

mother because she would not get out

father had sworn at his mother during
the quarrel.
Thursday the boy and his three
brothers were allowed to attend their
mother's funeral in custody of the
sheriff but the father was held in jail.
Yesterday the father was formally
charged with tlie murder.
