Jordan, 8, who told ofllcials Wednesday

George hung his head and failed to
answer. The ofllcials were quick to
follow the lead and asked Fred how
George happened to kill his mother
and the little chap said:
"George killed her with a gun."
The eight-year-old lad when asked

brother were true admitted them. He
said that he was playing with the gun
and did not know that it was loaded,
lie pulled tho trigger back and the

BIG SALES
Mark Opening Day of the Clos
ing Out Sale at the Snider
Furniture Store.
To say yesterday's sales at the Sni
der Furniture Company were beyond
expectations, is putting it very mildly,
for all day the sales forces were busy
as bees. By the time the sale was
scheduled to start Friday morning,
the street in front of tho store was
packed with eager buyers. While
arrangements had been made and
large crowds were expected, the sales
forces were overwhelmed and un
doubtedly many persons left without
being waited upon.
The Snider Furniture Company is
closing its store here, which la a
branch of the main store in Fairmont.
However, it is understood it will keep
a man hero to take orders and other
wise look after any business that is
not closed up.
This firm, under tho able manage
ment of I. B. Blaney, has enjoyed a
splendid business, and the buying pub
lic will regret to learn that this store
has been closed.
