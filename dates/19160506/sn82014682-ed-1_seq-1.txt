Under the provisions of the Work

This question of law which has not

filed in federal court by the law firm
of Smith; Warren & Sutton to li
bel suit brought against ; the ? Inter
Island steamer Claudine by. Kim Hong.
a Korean, who asks damages in the
sum of $21,500.
The constitution provides that the
United . States courts have exclusive
jurisdiction In all admiralty cases. The
territory, by the- worsmea s.tjompen

exclusive v iurisdlction to the Indus

jurisdiction of the federal court, are
entitled to Ignore the Workmen's
Compensation Law and. Instead, bring
suit in admiralty. ' r ; ;
i In raising thla question, the excep

In uart:
"That this court Is without jurisdic

Tlie fact that the text differs little from the early reports, and that'

which touches upon. Germany's twice outlining suggestions for peace.
Germany in this portion indicated that she was ready to entertain plans'
for peace provided her national interests are satisfactorily safeguarded
but that no response was made by the Allies to her hints.
It is evident from the tone of warded official discussion here that
there will be no further moves for peace made on the part of the United
States until the Allies are willing to receive suggestions, which, it is
thought; they are not now, because of German demands which they
