Last Saturday morning at about pa
11 o'clock the fire alarm was sound
ed for a fire in the residence of Mr.
Leodias J. Broussard, a member I,
of the firm of L. &. M. Sokoloski ,
Co. Ft
The fire had made good head- n'
way by the ti:lme the alarm was hi
sounded nrd t11' hose truck reach- rel
ed the scene, the blaze have practi
cally covered the roof. The origin
of the fire is thought to have been
caused by sparks romQ the kitchen
flue.
The datzilae to the building and
contents is estimated at about
$3,000.00, and is vovered by in
purg e to the amount of $2,000.00
Just recently the already beautiful
home had been fixed up and en
larged, and pretty furniture was
installed.
If men would ren. mber that
wonlen can't always be smiling,
who have to cook the dinner,
answer the bell half a dozen times,
get rid of a neighbor who has
dropped in, tend to a sick baby,
tie up the cut finger of a two-year
old, gather up the playthings of a
four-year-old, tie up the head of a
six.year-old on skates, and get an
eight-year-old ready for school, to
say nothing of sweeping, cleaning
etc A woman with all these to
contend with may claim it a privi
lege to look and feel a little tired
sometimes, and a .word of sym
pathy would not be too much to
expect from the man, who during
the honeymoon, wouldn't Ict her
carry as much as a sunshade.

New Water Hose
Is Much Needed
During the fighting of the fire
at the residlence of r. I,. J. Blrous
sard last S.tturdav Iuorntiing it was
cl -.irl\ sco it that there is an ini
mIediate nced for several joints of
new water hose. Several of the
apparently good looking joints of
hose, failed to hold the water, it
sceling through the hose all along
and to such an extent that the
pressure of the stream was very
much weakened. Abbeville is well
equipped for fighting fire with
practically this one exception. It
has the water pressure; it has the
way to reach a fire in less than five
minutes, and hv ptovidiIg gor 1
hose there is little cha;nce of hav
ing a heavy loss by fire if it is di.
covered in time. Lets have th1
matter threshed out. Any one w\ htn
wishes to offer a suggestion t i,
vited to use the column of this
paper.

Save Your
Baby Chicks
This is the time of the year all
little chicks are subject to the
mercy of the head lice, and
you should examine the chicks
daily. At first signs of the
presence of lice, ease chicks
head and neck with a little
Vasalene, and keep them out
of the sun for a clay. It's easy.
