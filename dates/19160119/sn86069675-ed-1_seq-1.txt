MERCHANTS CON
GRATULATE US
Upon Article Uurglng the Peeple to
Promptly Settle Their January
Accounts.
Last week wo had an article urg
ing the pcoplo to promptly sottle
with the merchants and quite a
number have called our ofllco and
congratulated us upon the article.
Wo were struck with tho following
editorial from tho Lexington Lead
er, of last Saturday, which wo re
produce :
Pay-Up idea Becoming Widely
Popular.
About a year ago Tho Leader
started a local campaign to induce
peoplo to pay their January bills
early, and with good results.
Tho merchants snid their collec
tions were bolter than they had ever
known them to bo so early in the
year. It was found that much of
tho delay in settling January and
July bills was not due so much to
tho inability to pay as it was to'the
tendency of many debtors to neglect
their duty to those who had accom
modated them during the year.
Tho Memphis Commercial-Appeal
has been making a survey of the
"pay-up" movement throughout the
country and makes tho following
observations :
"Tho Business Men's Association
of Flushing, N. Y., is working on a
plan to nfake tho Urst seven days in
February 'pay-up week' for the
community. Not only new debts,
but those of long standing, so longkhosfi who honored him with thepi
that some of them aro 'outlawed,'
aro to the objects of the campaign.
"Tho first step in this moyement
was the issuing by the association
of circulnrs sotting forth" the details
of tho plan. And these circulnrs
werocnpped with this sentence in
largo red letters that refused to ho
overlooked :
"'Man is, dust, and dust settles.
Be n man.'
"Under this in less glaring type
followed: 'Pay-up week Feb. 1 to
7. Live and -let live'
"Tho campaigners- are making a
direct appeal to conscience and the
innate sense of honesty. A man
who has enjoyed a benefit and has
not paid the legitimate and agreed
price is a defnulter to both his own
hetter nature and to his obligation
of honesty. This pay-up week is a
call to his memory and a summons
to his conscience.
"Last year Flushing tried a sim
ilar plan of settlement, but unfor
tunately got embroiled in a lawsuit
with a man whoso aunie was put
down in a list of delinquents
Whethor tho man owed a debt, or
whether he sued because there was
no Inw'to legalize tho publishing of
his namo is not stntcd. But the
suit broke up tho operators of the
association. This year, howevnr,
no such blunder will be committed,
for tho committeo is on its guard,
and tho whole business association
is hoping, with great enthusiasm,
for n comploto success.
"Other towns in the samo state
and soveral in New Jersey are
watching tho result in Flushing with
tho purposo of adopting it if it is
successful. Lexington, Ky., has
asked for a copy of nil plans and
specifications.
"To punctilious people it seems
strnngo that men and women should
need a reminder to pay a just debt.
They do not understand the mental
or moral condition that allows a
porson to put off paying for some
thing that has been acquired on a
credit a. trust to their honnsty and
gentility by the vendor. But there
are many poople who aro acciden
tally forgetful of such obligations; L
CIRCUIT COURT
NOW ISESSION
Judge Wm. A. Young Compliments
County Officials for Enforcing
Liquor Laws.
Circuit Judgo Wm. A. Young
oponod tho January term of the
Montgomery Circuit Court Monday
morning with tho most powerful,
masterly nnd comprehensive in
structions to tho Grand Jury it
has ever been the. writers privi
lego to hear.
Ho insisted that any violations of
the liquor laws bo rigidly investi
gated and paid a high compliment
to tho county officials for the
splendid manner in which they had
performed their duties under that
law. Ho also said .ho wanted the
violators of tho gambling laws in
dicted and stated that he intended
to sco that this evil was eradicated.
Ho dwelt at length upon the evils
of whisky and gambling, nnd said
that nearly over crime was trace
able to them and that during his
term of ofllco ho intended to fight
those two great evils' for tho pro
tection of our young men, stating
that should it become necessary,
ho would empanel a speciai'-'grnnd
jury for tho purpose.
Judgo Young said that during his
campaign for tho judgeship he had
promised the people that tho laws
should bo enforced and that it was
his intention, ambition and purpose
to show them that ho was sincere
in this promiso and to prove to
confidence and suffrage ,that their
trust had not been misplaced.
In the stand ho has taken for
law enforcement ho deserves the
support of every loyal citizen and
wo take this opportunity of offer
ing the columns of this paper to
assist him in this laudable under- J
taking.
Court News.
There arc eighteen equity cases t
nnd twenty-six common law caBes
besides eighty-four equity and twen
ty common law cases that' were
continued, -to be tried. There are
flftv-nine Comniomvnalth cases, but
most of them aro old cases that have
been continued for some time.
Tho grand jury is mnde up of the
others who deliberately stave off!
the settlement, never" stopping to
consider the possible plight of the1
ninn who docs tha 'selling and gives
them the credit.
"If not renlly dishonest in tho end
these men aro guilty of a selfish-)
ness that is thoroughly discredita
ble. "Look around and see how many
loetors, who havo allayed pain, are
.Kept waiting for their' money while
their own bills continue to run up;
how many grocers havo to carry an
imoonnt over for several turns of
the ledger pages; how many seam
stresses and washerwomen aro 'put
off' for petty reasons from receiv
ing their small pay. now about tho
plain-sowing woman who called four
times walking two miles each time
before she was finally paid the
$2.25 that was her duo, and for
whioh tho inexorable rent man was'
dunning hert
"It is this sort of dilatory bnbit
that pay-up week is intended to
bronk up. If Flushing is successful
in her movement she will -set on ex
auipje to tho whole country, and she
will havo acomplished a reform that
will rival in results the work of pro
fessional reformers. For a whole
community to join in such a task
shows a fcpirit of brotherhood thai
should insuro success,' particularly
with tho biggoht bumm club iu the
town leading in the movement."
