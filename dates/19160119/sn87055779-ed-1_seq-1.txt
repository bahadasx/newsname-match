"Emily Burger will never live to
marry my husband."
That "was one of the jealous out
bursts of Mrs. Elizabeth Frances
Möhr before the murder of her hus
band, for procuring which she is on
trial, according to George W. Itooks,
who was the state's star witness to
day. Books, now the brother-in-law of
Miss Emily Burger, was engaged to
marry the girl until three years ago,
when she Jilted him.
Under cross examination Books
denied that he ever made love to
Mrs. Möhr or threatened to "put a
couple of bullets through Dr. Mohr",
but he admitted that he was jealous
of the physician's attentions to Miss
Burger and that he often conferred
with Mrs. Möhr about the affair. He
said he was anxious both to win
back back Miss Burger and to help
Mrs. Möhr out of her domestic dif
ficulties. Atty. Fitzgerald's cross examina
tion revealed the defense contention
of an alleged love puzzle that laid
the proverbial "human triangle" in
the shade. As the defense lays out
the case, Books was engaged to Miss
Burner. She quit him for Möhr.
Mrs. Möhr loved her husband and
wanted to win him back and Books
offering to help her, made love to
her himself. Meantime, Mohr was
attentive to Miss Florence Ormsby,
his housekeeper, and Miss Burger
i.nd Mi-s Ormsby were not on speak
ing terms, because of their rivalry
for the doctor's favor.

LOS ANGELES, Calif., Jan. 19.
Twelve overdue overland trains on
the Santa Fe railroad and three alt
Lake route limited trains that have
been marooned by heavy rains in the
mountains, will reach Ixs Angeles
today. Some of the trains were due
here three days ago. The Southern
Pacific railway oHieials here an
nounced that their main line to
Colton, which would release the
trains, would be opened at 10 o'clock
this morning. Frederick W. Vander
tilt is a passenger on one of the
stalled trains from the east.
The Hood situation was still men
acing today in southern California
and a large section of Arizona. With
six persons drowned and enormous
property loss inflicted, more rain was
premised in the Hooded region.
The most serious situation existed
near Anaheim, where the Santa
Ana river is out of its banks. It i3
between Fullerton and and Anaheim
that three persons fleeing the flood
in a buggy were swept from the
state highway and drowned.
In Arizona the Gila river waa
spreading over a wide area south of
I hoenlx. The Salt river in Arizona
ulso was rising rapidly and threat
ening to do considerable damage.
Ivow lands May Suffer.
Although the storm abated today
the flood waters from the numerous
mountain streams had not reached
tho lowlands along the coast and it
vas feared that these sections would
suffer further damage.
Flood waters were carrying great
quantities of silt into San Pedro, the
port of Los Angeles, today, and C.
H. Matson. acting tratlic manager
of the harbor commission, said con
ditions were worse than two years
ago, when more than 3,000,000 yards
of tult was washed into the harbor
by storm waters.
A number of southern California
cities faced a food shortage and
strenuous efforts were being made
tc resume traffic in that section.
Bailroad officials said that the
damage from the storm was the
most severe in many years. It has
been years since the railroads and
telegraph companies have faced
such a stress of weather conditions
as have prevailed for the past 10

ERICA'S TRADE
LL NOT SUFFER
Acting Secretary of Commerce
Believes Blockade Will Not
Interfere With Exports.
International News Service:
WASHINGTON. Jan. 1?. Great
Britain's plan to tighten her block
ade against Germany may create a
new problem to perplex American
diplomacy, but the added restriction
imposed probably will not have the
effect of reducing to any great ex
tent the trade of the United States
with neutrals, according to the view
expressed today by Acting S'ec'y of
Commerce Edwin 1 Sweet.
"England's action tilings us face
to face with another situation the
possible dangers of which to Amer
ican trade cannot be definitely fore
told at this early stage, but it is in
conceivable that the nation's com
merce shall suffer greater hardships
through the stoppage of shipments
not intended for Germany,' the sec
retary said.
"The expected declaration would
first be felt most seriously by Nor
way and i-5weden. Shipments to these
countries will most likely be sub
jected to more rigid inspection, and
trade with those nations may be
slightly impeded. England suspects
that a great eleal of the goods des
tined to these two nations finally
gets through to Germany.
"It is utterly impossible to dis
prove these in the absence of rec
ords, but it is unfair for Great Pri
tain to a st . me that the greatly in
creased purchases made in America
by Norway and Sweden are being re
shipped to the capital powers.
"The Scandinavian countries for
