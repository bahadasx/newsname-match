Mexicans and taken across the border

The llrst report was followed by an
other that llfty cavalrymen hail been
sent from Iluchlu to pursue the Mexi
cans and rescuo tho United States
tniopers. Cowboys were also said to
bo in pursuit. It is believed hero that
the reports are exaggerated.
A despatch from Harhlta states
that a man named lxo arrived thoro
to-day with the story that six Mexi
cans engaged in raiding wero at
tacked and pursued by a detachment
of cavalrymen. Tho Mexicans showed
tight and one of tho cavalry horses
was killed, arcordlng to Lee, who
said ho saw tho tight. The Mexicans
retreatod across the border.
The story that seven cavalrymen
had been captured by Mexicans was
telephoned to Hauhltu by a pen-on
representing himself to b a cowboy
named Doollttlc. Homebody in Ha

AT 'BOOTUL BABY'
Says His Own Client, Broker
Martin, Was "a Boob to
Believe Her."
CASH GOES T6 JURY.
Woman's Lawyer Declares
Defendant Tried to Enforce
Single Standard.
Instead of th pet .iam& "Bfo'ful
Itaby," which was music to her ears
when broker John Leon Martin
courted her, Cora Maud ClArko to-day
heard herself called a "vamplro" and
saw Attorney Terence McManus do a
burlesque of the Romeo and Juliet
balcony scene which Miss Clarke had
described seriously as tho moment
when sho made her first and strong
est appeal to th(. broker, and In two
hours hud him proposing on his
knees.
At noon Tier (23,000 breach of prom
ise suit was placed In tho hands of
the Jury by Supremo Court Justice
liChman.
" 'Ittle DIN" was not the only ono to
suffer at the hands of Mr. McManus.
Tho lawyer took a long and sympa
thetic look at Martin, his client, and
shaking his hand at tho broker
shouted:
"And this woman coined a situa
tion, now a money making situation,
and she told a lot of fairy tales to
Martin. And the poor boob believed
her."
Martin's faro reddened and his
eyes dropped to tho floor whllo his
''boo'ful baby" smiled nt his discom
fiture Sho had sat Indlflerent, look
ing Mr. McManus squarely In tho
eyes whllo ho delivered his rhetorical
broadside nt her.
Tho lawyer turned his nttnrk upon
Uroadway and tho whlto lights and
said they had done quite onough for
Martin.
"Now this young mun reallres that
Uroadway Is not tho place for a
young and ambitious fellow, Thn
lights holpcd to ensnare him and this
woman capped tho cllmnx to his
downfall. Now ho sits at home. Tho
whlto lights are forgotten, but this
woman couldn't forget him. Especial
ly when ho received a legacy of (200,-
000 from his fnthor."
Ho mado tho Jurors laugh when ho
rehearsed the sceno at Iteisenwobcr's,
tho occasion of Martin's llrst meotlng
with "Hoo'ful llaby," when, sho al
leged, ho proposed on the stairway to
hor, two hours after being introduced
"Some ltoinoo who would do a thing
llko that," tho lawyer said. "Apd
she must havo been a llnu Juliet to
havo accepted such a proposal when
the champagne "as flowing so
freely."
In defending MibS ClaiUc, Attorney
Aaron l Jctmoro said that Martin
was attempting to Justify himself un
der a slnglo standard and that ho
did not want 'o apply this standard
to her.
"He wanted to be false to this little
woman but he did not want her to
speak to a slnglo man friend," tho
lawyer said.

Wlllard calling for n light with
Frank Moran here some unio between
Aprfi 10 and April 22 t h.- tight to
fee under his, Curlev's, ni.in.igeinenl).
"But," and here'i the rub,
"Williard will not be dictated to
by Moran, who tays He wants the
fiuht to be held in March. I am
not crazy to run the finht." con
tinued Curley, "neither am I anx
ious to let it flip out of my handi,
A $100,000 gate looki just at good
to me as it does to Rickard and if
I can run it, pay Willard $32,500,
Moran his end, and take care of
the running expenses, a $15,000
profit would be worth it.
"If Moran insists on fighting
Willard in March, he'll have to
go to a back alley in search of a
chance at the title," went on Cur
ley. "HE'LL EITHER FIGHT
WILLARD WHEN I SAY SO OR
WILLARD WILL NEVER GIVE
HIM A CHANCE TO FIGHT
FOR THE TITLE."
Curley was ,iHle, to ,'xpl.un away

ing a championship tight himself In
Apri'l. On his anivul in the West
Jo&ti told him WlUftrd woJiUa't
think of fighting Moran In March, and
ltlckartl was no informed. ThlH
seemed to give Curley the piivllcgn
of doing business with Willard and
Jones on his own hook.
Conferences between Jones, '"urley
nnd Wellman, representing lllckard,
took plnre in the llaltlmnrn Hotel,
Katisan City, dtirin? which all kinds
of offers for tho tight were received
ami considered Wellman was given
to understand that Wlllard would ao
cept (,13,urii, a raise of (3,000 over the
original Rlekard offer. This wua
wired to Ilickard. according to Curley,
with a request for a quirk answer.
Tho answer didn't como quick enough,
and. on Curley says, we became tired
of waiting und went over and signed
Wlllard to his artiel.
Curley says u little underground
stuff on Hlckard'a part aliiosl nan

stuff was a pllvate iiwkshk'i to Jones
offering him (J.S00 'for himself and to
say nothing about it) to get Wlllard's
signature tu tho articles Curley had
carried Vest, presumably as an ncont
for Itlckard.
Curley sajH he hadn't seen Moran
yet to get his slgnaturo but that bo

This :h a funny angle to tho whole
ptoposltton. Here was Curley going
West with articles calling for n light
between Wlllard and Moran for
Hit kit nl and .it the same time baring
an agieument with Moran for a fight
with Willnrd under his own (Cur- j
ley's) promotion.
In answer to this Curley Insists that
Kickard know all tho limn that he
(Curley) was after tho tight and
wasn't doing any double-crossing
Curley, however, said ho wanted an
April date, but haU no objection to
Itlekaid getting Willard for Match
If ho could.
"Yes sir," saJd Curley. "Willard Is
going out with tho circus again on
April 29, and be wants to have two
tights between now and then. I can't
