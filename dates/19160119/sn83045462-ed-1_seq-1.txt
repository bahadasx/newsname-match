The government manufactui

the use of the army and navy an
the prohibition of the ntanufat
turc of such artieles by privat
concerns was urged in the Scnai
; today by Senator Cummins <
i Iowa.
lie addressed the Senate on h:
town resolution proposing an it
|\ estimation by a committee of fiv
senators into the feasibility of tli
j government manufacture of a
j munitions for the armv and tiav;
including warships: the propc
location of such manufacturin
plants and the necessary legisl;
tion to prevent private person
and corporations from continuin
in the manufacture of war intin
I .
j tions.
j As National Safeguard.
I Senator Cummins told the Senate thj
the adoption of his plan would remo\
all chance of the United States bein
pushed into war in the interests <
munition manufacturers. He said th;
it would save the country money i
the end, and would provide a sui
means of obtaining: sufficient animun
tion in the event of war And third!,
it would put an end .n the future t
all discussions as to whether the Unite
States was neutral or not in supplyin
munitions to belligerents.
The attention of the Senate was d
rected to the enormous amounts c
[money which the people in the Unite
States engaged in the manufacture c
munitions have made since the war i
Europe began.
"It may be that circumstances ma
arrive," said Senator Cummins, "whic
may he met only by war. I am hopin
that these conditions will not confror
us. but if there comes a time in whic
we must decide for war or against wa
the men and boys who must die in th
struggle which we may enter, th
homes that will he desolated and th
sorrows which will fill the land have
right to insist that the question touch
ing our honor, safety and institution
shall be decided in a forum uncorrupte
and undisturbed by love of money c
the opportunity that business may s*
of reaping profit by slaughter of th
human kind."
Denies Sinister Intentions.
Senator Cummins said that he di
not intend to intimate that any grea
portion of the men interested in th
manufacture of arms would consciousl
or maliciously precipate a war, hut i
the very nature of things they cannc
look upon war with a feeling th*
animates the great hotly of the peoph
Necessarily, he said, these men muj
desire to he successful in business, an
'this business cannot be successful i
the highest degree unless the countr
is at war or is preparing for war.
"In this critical moment," said Senate
I Cummins, "what is the attitude of th
makers of munitions? Without exception:
I so far as 1 know, they are insisting upo
jthe most comprehensive program which
is possible to conceive, which would tur
[this country into a military camp an
practically destroy all ambition, save th
ambition to overcome by force of arm
!the entire world. This is a perfectl
natural course for them to pursue. The!
lousiness is to supply material for wai
and it is not in mortal man to escap
'lie temptation to gain in the enterpris
in which he is engaged."
Increase of Munition Plants.
Senator Cummins pointed out that afte
the commencement of the war, and prio
to October L't>, 1915. there were organize
in the United States 174 new corpora
tions for the purjiose of manufacturin
munitions of war. lie showed that frot
August 1, 1914. to November 1, 191.
there were exported from this country t
Europe ammunition and firearms to th
value of $161,964,-78, and that export
are increasing month by month. H
showed that the stocks of corporation
manufacturing arms arid munitions hav
increased in value by leaps and bound?
He showed that the increase in marke
value of the Mocks of eighteen sue
corporations had been 1432,056,a00.
Senator Cummins made it clear tha
while he deplored war he realized tha
a country may be called upon to figli
to preserve free institutons and to pro
ted the lives and liberties of its citi
zens. ".My resolution is meaningles
to those who believe we should stan
defenseless before the world," sai
Senator Cummins. He said that Ire in
tended to express his ideas in th
future on the extent of military arma
ment which the safety of-this countr
requires.
Points to Happy Medium.
"In the meantime it is sufficient t
suggest that somewhere between tli
armed camp of William of German
and the open dove cote of William (
j Nebraska there must be an lionorabl
abiding place for a great nation whit
is prepared to lead the world towar
peace, but will not submit to injustk
or indignity."
If war comes, said Senator Cummin
it must be the result of calm pur pot
to meet the awful scourge. He d<
dared it ought to he made impossibi
for any man or corporation to mak
money out of war.
Senator Cummins pointed out tha
substantially every plant capable <
producing arms and ammunitions i
any considerable quantity lies betwee
the Alleghany mountains and the Ai
lantic coast. He said that the officer
of the army are practically a unit no'
in the conclusion that if one of th
great powers of Europe were to mak
war upon America the entire territor
east of the Alleghany mountains woul
speedily .fall into the hands of th
enemy, 'fehis was another reason, fa

e and Senator Podge of Massachusetts, j
rging that some affirmative action be j
iken, 011 tho one hand, and Senator !
larke of Arkansas and Senator Williams
r Missouri demanding that the matter
f? left entirely to the executive, on the
ther hand, had been the principal speakrs.
Would Express Policy.
Senator Borah and Senator Podge
ontended that the foreign relations
ommittee, and after it the Senate,
hould express itself definitely as to
hat the policy of this government
hould be in regard to Mexico. Senator
orah urged that a resolution be adoptil
authorizing the President to use the
rmy and navy to protect Americans
1 Mexico. He suggested that it would
e the proper thing for the President
> inform Carranza that the United
tates was ready to take a hand in
ringing order out of chaos in Mexico
ince it was apparent that Carranza
naided was unable at present to com
leie sucn a iasK.
The position taken by the republican
?nator was that to leave the pending:
^solutions up in the air was to keep
le Mexican people iti the dark as to
hat the I'nited States intended toward
lem. He said that the Villa crowd
light^regard the failure to act as an
ncouragement to it, and the <*arLnza
people, on the other hand, might
jgard the pending resolutions as a conaut
threat, which might be carried
it against them at any time.
The need of some definite policy by
?is country was strongly urged by
>th Senators Borah and Lodge.
Position of Democrats.
The democrats, on the other hand, ilisted
that the entire matter be left to
le President and his officers to lianle,
and that by agitating the matter
ily embarrassment would result. The
smocrats seemed solidly in favor of
tch a course, with perhaps the ex?ption
of Senator Pomerene of Ohio,
ho expressed the opinion that sotneling
ought to be clone. Senator Smith
" Arizona, democrat, who has been in
ic past a strong supporter of some
[firmative action toward Mexico, toly
leaned the other way and sided
ith his democratic colleagues.
The threat made yesterday by Senior
Borah that if the foreign relations
>nimittee did not report on th^se resoitions
a motion would be offered in
le Senate to discharge the committee
10111 further consideration of one or
lore of the resolutions, still holds
ood, though Senator Borah said today
liat he intended to look into the sitation
somewhat further before offerig
such a motion.
Embargo Resolutions Referred.

V Senators H tehcock and "Works were'
jferred by the committee to a sub>mmittee
consisting of Senators |
itchcock. Smith of Arizona and Lodge. I
Senator Stone said thai the commit e
had agreed to pass over the noniiition
of Henry }\ Fletcher to he amissador
to Mexico, since no reply has
et been received from the State Deirtment
to the resolution adopted by
te Senate on the instance of Senator
all of Mexico, requesting the departent
to furnish information regarding
ie circumstances which led to the
icognition of the Carranza movement.
Resolution Asks for Information.
A resolution calling on the President
ir information if the United States
id entered into any relations with
>uth American or Central American
publics which would require the
uited States to consult them before
sing the army or navy to protect
merican citizens in Mexico was in- 1
oiiuced by Senator Sherman, reptib:an,
of Illinois. Xo action was taken
id no debate was provoked by its in- ,
oduction.
There was an echo of the Mexican sit- (
it ion in the House today when Repsentative
Treadway of Massachusetts }
ad to the House a letter he had reived
from a friend on the border, ,
Uing of the aggressions of Villa's <
en in that region and complaining
Lterly of the inaction of this movement.
The correspondent was not in ,
vor of intervention at this time, but \
commended that if the Carranza gov-. (
nmeiit is not upon an efficient basis (
ithin thirty days the United States
ould take hold of the situation.
The reading of the letter was heard
silence and provoked no comment.

NOT SEEKING POWER
FOR PRESENT BOARD
Commissioners Willing Change
in School System Shall Come
When Their Terms Expire.
NOW FOR APPOINTMENTS
BY EDUCATION DIRECTOR
Mr. Newman Says President Suggested
Centralized Control of District
Affairs at Hearing on Bill.
The Commissioners will he
willing to amend tile centralizedcontrol
hoard of education bill so
that it is not effective until the
present commissioners arc out ot
office, and tlicy have also submitted
a substitute for the original
bill by which the appointing
power of teachers and employes
shall he with the director of education
instead of the board of
Commissioners a< originallv proposed.
These were the most important
points brought out today in the
hearing before Representative
Lloyd's subcommittee on education
in the first hearing on the
bill which Representative Johnson
of Kentucky introduced at
the Commissioners' request, the
bill being but a part of the general
scheme to centralize control of
everything in the District government
in the Commissioners.
Commissioner Newman, opening the
argument for the Commissioners* side,
gave the interesting information that
it W U K fro C i da 1"1 t U'ilonn'o c.rrn-nnt
that administrative reforms might be
made in the District that led the Commissioners
to their present recommendations.
He distinctly said several
times, however, that the present bill
itself is not a recommendation of the
President, as he made no specific suggestions.
Following Commissioner
Newman, Corporation Counsel Syme
took the stand and argued against a
divided responsibility. He made considerable
of the information which lie
brought with him from the auditor that
the board of education is behind in its
reports.
Substitute Bill Offered.
A substitute bill prepared by the
Commissioners was presented to the
subcommittee at the opening of the
hearing. It provides that appointments.
etc.. should l?e made by the proposed
director of education, instead of
by the Commissioners, as proposed
unuer the original centralized power
scheme. The substitute bill provides
that:
"All appointments, promotions, reductions,
transfers and removals of assistant
directors of education, directors, supervising
principals, principals, heads of
departments, teachers and all other
employes of the public schools of the
District of Columbia shall hereafter be
made by the director of education.'
President Suggests Improvement.
That President Wilson had suggested
an improvement in District government
and that the educational recommendation
of the Commissioners had
been the result of that suggestion was
brought out early in the hearing. Commissioner
Oliver P. Newman, who spoke
in support of the Commissioners' recommendation.
being the first to appeaibelore
the subcommittee, admitted that
the proposed plan was due to the President's
suggestion to him.
Representative I.loyd had questioneh
Mr. Newman as to the possibilities of
outside influences being brought to
bear upon the school system if the
system was changed as proposed.
It is certainly true that if t he
President of the 1'nited States should
make a suggestion regarding the.
schools thai suggestion would receive
\ery careful consideration." said Mr.
Newman. "The same is true if a committee
of Congress should make a suggest
ion."
Cites an Example.
A number of the committeemen asked
Commissioner Newman to cite an example
in which the President had
made suggestions as to the management
of the District's affairs, as the
speaker had related incidentally in continuance
of his above explanation.
"Why," said the Commissioner, "the
President suggested the plan of the
present program, which includes this
recommendation. I don't mind telling
you wry frankly that when the NewYork
bureau of research was suggested
lo make ? modern government here
President Wilson sent for me to talk
it over and suggested that we might
make a survey and investigation ourselves,
with tlie object of centralizing
power in the District. I want it very
listinctly understood, however, that the
President was not responsible for this
specific recommendation."
"The President knows that you have
nade this recommendation, doesn't he.'"
questioned Representative Focht.
"Yes." said Mr. Newman.
I'pon pursuing the questions further
i denial was received from Mr. New- ^
nun ihaf he knew what wa? th?
ienl's attitude toward ll*e proposed
hang*?.
Causes Listeners to Smile.

Upon hearing explained that the Sureme
Court of the District of Colum
ia was in the habit of appointing
hreA colored members on the board of
ducation, the entire membership of
irhich numbers nine, and that the colred
school population is rather less
lian one-third. Representative Ragsla
