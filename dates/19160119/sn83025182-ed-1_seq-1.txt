BL PASO, Texas, Jan. 19.—Car
ranza's death order has thrown a chill
of horror Into the hearts ot Mexican
bandits. The,public parade of the
corpses of bandits to show the'fate of
the lawless, has driven the outlaws
farther Into the mountains today.
With the reported murder of two
more Americans near Torreon still un
confirmed, Carranza officials in 'Juarez
were confident that the campaign of
extermination would satisfactorily
avenge the slaughter of eighteen
Americans at Santa Yaabel.

British warships, the navy officers
assert, would not have to lie off Ger

would only have to demonstrate ability
to prevent ships carrying supplies of
any kind from reaching enemy ports.
This could be done at considerable
distance from Austro-German waters.
British men-o-war could stop and
seize all cargoes enroute to neutral
ports, also, upon proof of ultimate en
emy consumption. This would be the
principal hardship upon neutrals of
an actual blockade—probable seizure
upon mere susplolon of neutral bound
cargoes, without substantial evidence.
That the American government would
be bound "by civil war blockade pre
