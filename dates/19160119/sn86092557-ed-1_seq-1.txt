' Statisticians Are
Bewildered by War
NOTHING HAS WORKED OUT THE
WAY THEY SAID IT
WOULD
I PARIS, Jan. 19.?(Correspondence
of The Associated Pres3).?The pro
longation of the war baB had. the cf;'
feet of complicating femarkably the"
work of the statistician. The man who
is fond of figuring out what given
circumsttnces will produce in ail sorts
of occasions began ,hia calculations
on the supposition that ail would be
over within a few months. After the
few months passed he began to figure'
on a year, and a gain, he had a revise
his figures.
>vThe .most intricate problem that he
has been working on is what, will be
the; total destruction' in value" ofthe
men killed' and .men .disabled' fbr life.:
Statisticians: working. on this problem'
go' .back as far as the war of the*
Crimea: in '61, when Prbiidhon esti
mated the value of a man's life at 20;
000 francs .(($4,000): Since then writ-:
ers.onUhls subject have for the'most'
part discredited' the arbitrary figure
and;,have valued the; life or services,
of .a man according' to his producing"
capacity. . >'
:Foville made'the'far more moderate'
estimate of . $800 as the'average: valued
of the-men killed, in the war of. 1870.
Coming down to the present tlmo,
.Yves Guyot .considers that a man's
salary or wages represents no more
than half , the value of the production
to which he: contributes, and starting
from that, basis he figures that during
the first six months of the-war France
had loBt ,$3,000,000,000 through the
disappearance and disabling of- pro",
duclng'.men. On the same basis the
loss to date would be $9,000,000,000,
but other writers contest the sound
ness ofthe basis on which these llg
urea'were/produced. It the workmen,
on a salary of $2 a day, may be con
siderci'worth from $7,000 to $10,000,'
the engineer, who earns $20 a day.imay
bo considered worth $100,000, and-vtf
?these figures were taken in .viow of
the heavy losses in officers, the total
would amount, ;perhaps, to double- the
statistician's figures.
