With the ending of the Montenegrin

i as the "New Year's battle." came to an
, end January 15, according ti the Aus

eighty-mile front, having indicted
losses on the Russians estimated at

captured.
That this ends only one phase of the
offensive, however, is indicated by the
Austrian otlleial statement that Russian
re-enforcements are being thrown Into

offensive was undertaken with the dual
?purpose of less"nitii? the strain on the
