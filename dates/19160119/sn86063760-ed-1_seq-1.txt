TELLS OF ASYLUM
IMANNIN DESCRIBES BETTER
TREATMENT OF PATIENTS
THANKED BY ASSEMBLY
Governor's Special ssage on the
State Hospital for the Insane- I
Conditions Have Improved-Econ
emy Without Inefficiency-What
the Governor Recommends.
Governor Manning delivered a spe
ciai message to the General Assembly
Friday dealing with the State Hos
pital for the Insane. By his intense
interest in the State Hospital for the
Insane, by his apparent sincerity, by
his unvarnished statement of facts,
he completely captured the members
of the General Assembly and won
their sympathies in a cause that is
already close to his heart.
Perhaps never before has a per
sonal message been so convincingly
and sympathe:ieaily presented to arI
audience of lawn:akers. And when it
was all over it br.:ht forth the
unanimous adoption of the following
resolution offered by Mr. -McCullough
of Greenville:
"Resolved. That the thanks of this I
joint assembly are hereby extended t
to his Excellency, Gov. Manning, for t
his most instructive, interesting and I
soul stirring message, and we pledge
to him and these in authority our
hearty support in their efforts to bet
ter the conditions of these unfortu
nate wards of the State contned in It
the State Hospital for the Insane."
We print below extracts from the
message. including:
1. A comparison of present con
ditions with those formerly exist
ing.
2. A dnancial report, showing
economies p.racticed without les
sened e__ i ccy
S. A general account of the 1
treatmert of patients, their chang- IL
ed temperament and re-awakened
interest in self and surroundings.
4. The governor's recommenda
tions and ap:,eal to the legislators
to provide for the unfortunates.
Gentlemen of the General Assem- 1
bly: In my annual message I stated I
that I would transmit to you a spe- M
cial messago '^ali:a w= the State
Hospital for the Insane. '
courteously invited me to del- 2:
message in person. Permit me to e
thank you for this privilege.
At the outset. I wish to state clear- "
ly that in referring to the conditions ,
which I found there when I became t
governor; it must not be regarded as
a personal criticism, but rather a
statement of facts and conditions as
I found them. I would be disinge
nious if I did not make a full state
ment to you of this whole situation
and its needs.
From personal observation I found
last year the physical condition C
this institution to be intolarable, i
we are to consi,1er the treatment O
these unfortunates as a solemn det
And as an act of h maneness aro
charity. The treatment of those v
patients nas custodii., rather than
that of giving skilled treatment t
improve their conditiu. of m ::l as
well as of body. ' S
This condition was fully re':eele
to you in an exhrustive report made1
by Dr. Herring last year through me~
to you, I feel that it is unneressary
to repeat here what w?.s stated i
that document. You, in a body, at8
my Invitation visited- that institution
then, and the condition as shown by h
that report. a il by what you found
there, convinculJ you of the necessity
for reorganization of the institut on
and a change in the treatment of the b
in;ates. I am sure that you recas
vividly the picture of wl.at you sa'w
then.
Yesterday I invited you to nta~n
visit this institution so that you could
see for yourselves, in a measure at
-least, what has been done, and as b
ing done. un-Ier the Acts which yo''
so wisely aasd:t the li session o
the legislature- The inprovemer~ts g
in the physical property a'e be n
carried on in a thorcugh. and effi
cient manner. and vwhen this work is p
completed I feel that it will be at
enduring monumernt to your wisdom i
and humaneness in providing for th.et
comfort and the improved treatmient
of these unfortunate citizens of our e
State.
Last year you saw the wretched I
condition., the discomforts and dirt of
the cells in which th -se people were
confined. I saw, and you saw, how
the meals served were cold and un
Dalatble. You saw in the womens I
departntt-whicwh was the: the beat
deartmtent in that institution-h
silent witnese-ti>se straps that
were arou~nd the walthat wer se
to restrain violerat patien..
Gentlemen, the temptatio tomes
to go on and entunerat h ifr
thIngs that were re-.oltina. but I ha v
promised .you not to do so
can not refrain fromnyl: o
that women's ward. ar~ es te w' C
was then in beat C co'dn you
recall that in th .t ward for vicien~
-patients there wvere ninety-two o
these violent suPjects. They were
confined in cells.
We found that the? fire protection
was absolutely inndi~'qt:e ani '
operative: we found that the fire hose
could not be a'~ttache to the hydrau
because they did not fit, and it simplyA
is appaalline to tink what a terre
disster would have occurred had fre
broken out. It that fire had occurred
in the night tirme. with two nurses
ny in charge of the ninety-two
patets, it does not require any ce
srption from me to tell you what
would have happened.
I want to say to you that under the
c~.r4ged taetent that restraint foe
vioent subjects is no longer resorted<
to but, ir-sead. the kinder and more'i
effecive nmetbods; where they arei
put in baths and treated in simple
ways we find as the result that those
patients sh~oeid imnprovement both i
mind and in body. I
Gentlemon,. these clhanges that
have been iongut-ated there are the
resut of your wisdom in enactin
laws which r.de the cbanges pos
sible. andi I ear stly reerrnend the
contintanc ofhis work as necessary
if we are to die-h'rze our obligations
ta ihms ur- ero -te citi:'ens who
have tM -isfortu~ to be afflicted~
in this way.
I want to sa to youI that the re-h
over from the appropriation of last
year was $17.6S5.
Now I want to call your attention
to the fact that saving in operating
expenses has not been at the expense
of the comforts of those patients. The
average daily number in that institu
tion, through the year 1915, has been
1 17 patients more than in the year
previous-than in 1914. With the
increased average attendance of 117
patients, the cost in maintenance has'
been reduced $14,175.17. The per
apita expense in 1914 was $176.7S.
and in 1915 $170.92.
I want to call your attention fur
:her to the fact that besides this in
rease in average of patients. that
they had added for the care of those
atients twenty-two trained nurses:
hey have added ten physicians,
,hose time is given entirely to the
are of those patients, whereas be
'ore three regular physicians, giving
LI their time, were employed, and
bree for a part of their time.
One of the first items that was
aken up in the character of savings
)y Dr. Williams after his inaugura
ion into that office was in the mat
er of the laundry. In 1914 thel
nonthly pay roil in laundry was
702; in 1915 it was reduced to $237
, month, making a saving for the.
rear of $5,700. That work, instead
)f being done by paid negro women.
as done by the negro women who
were in the institution. not by com
ulsion nor by force, but simply by
)ersuasion, and being glad to get the
>portunity of having occupation
-ather than in sitting around in idle
Less all the time.
When Ir. Williams investigated I
urther he found that there were fif- t
een colored women scrubbers who
ook care of the white women's ward i
.t $10 each per month: and six men
crubbers, who took care of the white
en's ward, at $16 each per month.
'hose were discharged and patients <
n the institution were glad to do
hat work. The saving in this item
ras $2,952 for the year. t
On the farm the cost of operating
or 1914 was $9,127.49; the cost of
perating the farm in 1915 was $4,
32.66. making a saving in the oper
ting expenses of the farm of $4,
44.83.
The saving in these items, gentle
en, amounts to $13,296.83.
There was another item, the exact
gures of which I did not remember.
o take from the report of the pre
ions year. but I want to say in the
em of whiskey prior to Dr. Wil
ams being placed in charge was
ought at that institution by the bar
el. I want to say to you now that
he consumnption of whiskey in that
istitution is less than a quart per a
:onth.
I want to say that in the institu
:n. following out the plan of giving
:ion and diversion to the pati
nts, they have now a printing plant r
-here some of the inmates daily t
-ork; they now have a laundry 1
'here inmates do most of the work; t
:.ey have kitchens where the work is
rgely done by the inmates. - ,
The inmates police the grounds;
hey have a broom factory and a mat- t
Tess factory; they do knitting; they t
ave a sewing room. making clothes a
r- many of the inmates: they have
rinters and they are using many of
te innates on the farm, and in addi- I
on to that. gentlemen. there is n
stablhted a denartment there of d
aset making and fancy work. t:
:ix .'eks :efore the state Fair o
as held they employed Miss Austin u
i that derartmlent. Miss Austin o
.nie to lock over the neid. ' After n
ceing ti ;atients she wondered if .
he could do arything for them. They o
ere iling in their beds; she could t
ot induce them to get up for several
eeks. c
She Enaliy interested them in
ti:y v'0r2. and basket making. They e
reatly improved, and finally she in- a
trested fifty' of those women, who a
ad been m-ore dead than alive and 1
.jt interested in aything, and theyg
ere e-ager in the mhorning when the 1
onr canie at which time they could ia
egin their work. Centlemen, as aa
esult of this, three of those inmates o
ar been absolutely restored to r
tion and have gone back to their h:
on and have zone back to their \
omnes.
Now. I want' to say this. that the
umber of patients whlo are now eiu- !
loyed and given occupation amountp
> 09; that that was the figure
ieinthe repourt a :ew days ago. s
It may well now be asked, afterb
on hav" seen what the physical im-n
rovements have been. how" that has
ee carried on. You have seen there b
the wards that have act yet been
:;uched their condition, those of you I
~ho have visited it. and I do earn- G
stty urge that every mnember of this
islature who has not been there
ill take personal inte:est in the:
ork and feel that it is part of his
terest, and see the benents you are
antrring on these people.
Now I wish to cay that siuce the
e~ort of the board of regents was

u
Slay Parties Who Attacked Train
and Slew Americans-Telegrams
Published.
Gen. Carranza has renewed his as- t;
surances to the United States that he d
would make every effort to punish n
.hose responsible for the murders o: D
:mericans near Santa Ysabel.
A dispatch from Consul Silliman,
it Queretaro, to the state department r
,aid Carranza had personally assured C
.Ir. Silliman, in reply to the depart- c
2nent's demand that the murderers
)e run down, that he "had issued q
rders for the immediate pursuit, i
apture and punishment of those re- t
ponsible for the atrocity." The dis
>atch from Consul Silliman follows: t
"Department's telegram of Jan- a
iary 13, five p. m., massacre Amer'- c
ans at Santa Ysabel, received at t
sight-twenty, and implaced before ,
len. Carranza by me in person. Gen. b
arranza said that he had already b
ssued o;ters for the immediate pur- ti
uit, capture and punishment of those P
-esponsible for the atrocity. ec
"He stated that he believed this
utrage was committed by men asso- g
ilated with Villa and that it was
lone specially to provoke interna- 0
ional troubles at this time. He said P
ie had declared those responsible a
>utside the law, to be punished with b
leathdif caught.
"He appeals to the secretary of B
tate and to the public of the United
states to consider the wide strip of
he Central Railway, the great diffi
ulty of guarding the entire distance,
.nd t: comparatively easy task of
Lest-o .ng a train or attacking a T
mall place.
"He says that nobody can lament
sore than he such an atrocity or be
ore concerned about it, but that
rotection is relative and that even
a the best requested (?) states out- H
ursts of disorders and lawlessness T1
tay cause destruction of property fa
nd loss of life. K
"He says be is expecting full re
orts from Gen. Trevino, and that all
fforts will be made to protect Amer- A
:ans and any other foreigners who tr
may be in the district. His belief is
he massacre was made premediatige
r by a band who fled at once after
be raid."
Carranza's telegram to his embassy
allows:
"The government, under my direc
[on, has adopted every necessary
2easure to insure the prosecution of t
n energetic campaign for the cap
are and destruction of the party of
illista bandits. and to continue the
ame to its complete accomplish- at
lent. I have asked Gen. Jacinto P. fo
'revino, commanding the Constitu- w
oialist troops in the neighborhood Ss
f the assassinations, to obtain for by
ie the names of the assailants in m
rder that a decree may be issued th
acing them outside the pale of the co
tw. When this is done any citizen
r citizens of the republic will have
be right to arrest the guilty parties hi
rithout other warrant, and to exe- tr
ute them without formality. tr
"Similar decrees were issued and ty
recued favorably in the cases of s;
ssaults and dynamiting of trains in li
nother section of the republic with- we
2 the year, notably when a passen- wa
en train was dynamited and its pas- fo
engers assaulted near Apizaco and m:
gain near Jauasa. These decrees t
re made effective because in the
pinion of the government those who
erpetrate such assassinations of
uman beings, be the victims native
eicans or foreigners, must be con
[dered in exactly the same category G<
s those who dynamite the railway
rains. I sincerely deplore the un
ardonable crime at Santa Ysabel."
A dispatch from Laredo, Texas,
ays Gen. Venustiano Carranza, as o
ead of the de facto Siexican govern- ~
ient. has issued an order authoriz- t
ig "any citizen" to put to death to

merican mining men at Cusihuira- s

OF MUCH FEELING
ARRANLA TAKES ACTION
oldiers Ordered to Hunt Down Ban
dits-Senators Freely Talk of In
tervention if Carranza Fails to
Keep Orderi-Note Sent to Mexico
-Government Policy Unchanged.,
Eliseo Arredondo, ambassador
esignate of the de facto government
f Mexico, called at the state depart
ent and assured Secretary Lan
ig that Carranza troops had been 1
ispatched to western Chihuahua
rith orders to kill or capture all the
audits concerned in the slaying of
Lmerican citizens. He said every
arranza soldier in northern Mexico
rodld be pressed into service if
ecessary to accomplish this purpose.
In a statement later Mr. Arredondo
aid that the men who lost their lives 1
ad attempted to reach their place of
usiness before complete control of
ae region had been accomplished by
1e Carranza forces. He said they
ad been given permission at their
wn request to pass through the Car
paa lines, although Americans d,
een warned to keep out of terri ry
i whichs guerilla warfare was in pro
ross.
Mr. Arredondo went to the state
epartment at the close of a day de
Dted largely in official circles to the
lexican situation. President Wilson
niferred with Secretary Lansing and
lcussed the subject with callers. He
understood to have told some of
re latter that the Chihuahua mine
nployees had been specifically warn-!
I not to go into Mexico.
During the day Secretary Lansing;
Lade it clear that the United States
ould expect from the de facto gov
-ment evidence that the murderers!
ad been punished and that if proper
eps were not taken an issue might
ise between the United States and
te Carranza administration.
This statement was considered sig
[cant of ~the determination of the
nited States to enforce protection of
a citizens in Mexico. The secretary;
Ided another warnin' to Americans;
Mexico to. leave districts "where
tere is revolutionary trouble."
e
Congress has been swept by a] t
ave of indignation over the killing N
American citizens by Mexican ban
ts near Chihuahua. Demands for:
tion. came from minority members,
d.while the administration leaders
innsellede patientce, even Senator
:one, chairman of the enate for- R
gn relations committee, admitted 1
at if Carranza, after a fair trial, I
led to protect foreigners in Mexico,
tervention was inevitable. e
The atmosphere was surcharged n
th excitement when the Senate and
ouse met Wednesday and the storm
'oke quickly. Senat r Sherman, Re
iblican, of Illinois, introduced, a
solution to express the sense of
ngress that there should be. inter
ntion by the United States and
i-American nations unless Gen.
rranza could comply at once with a
'mand that be protect the lives and s:
operty of foreigners. s:
In the House Representative Dyer n
Missouri offered a resolution ask- N
g President Wilson If he did not _
ink the time had arrived to aban- a
>n watchful waiting and invade
exico. t
The resolutions were not acted
>on, both being ref erred to the for
gn affairs committee. Senators t
illinger and Borah, off the Repub-n
an side in the upper house, echoed n
e terms of the Sherman resolution,
bich declared that the Carranza b
ivernment appeared powerless to; b
pe with the lawlessness in Mexico.
Ld declared, intervention the only
ternative unless reparation for the n
aihuahua outrage were speedily ti
ade. c.
Senator Stane urged patriotic sup- h
rtof the president and. pratient for- ja
arance until the experiment of try-.a
g out the Carranza governmentn
old prove a failure. v
"If Carranza proves himself ineffi
rt,'' he added, however, "if he is
nble to punish ciiminals and to in-*
re safety to foreigners in Mexico. I
Ink with the senator from Idaho,
r. Borah, that there is only one
ing ... do, and that is to go down
ere armed and intervene."
Senator Thomas of Colorado also
vised .against ,Intervention exceptc
an uniavoidable resort, declaring
at the : United -St ates niever wouldn
t out. of. Mexico if its armies cross
the Rio Grande. He made a vig
ous speech assailing the Standard
1 company and the Parson Oil Syn-v
cate,- charging that these interess
rough rival efforts to monopolize
e oil properties in alexico, had been
'sponible for~ the revolutions.t
Senator Stone asked: Senator Gal
ger what he. would have the U nit-I
tStates do.
Senator Gallinger--replied witih as
rance that he had no desire to emn
rrass the administration In tehe
exian crisis, but said h'e thought
. if the *de facto government could
>preserve order, President Wil
gshould communicate with con
ess and ask what was his further
ity.

INSISTS ITALIAN LINER
MUST SAIL MINUS GUNS
American Government to Detain Ves
in Port Until Issue is De
termined.
The desire of the United States
government that the two three-inch
guns mounted on the, Italian liner
Giuseppe Verdi, at Ne-w York, be re
moved and the vessel depart unarmed
upon its return voyage has been ex
pressed to the Italian ambassador,
count Macchi di Cellere, by Secre
ary Lansing. The secretary's views
.ill be transmitted to the Italian gov
?rnment; and it is said until a reply
.s received the liner will be detained
a port.
It is understood that the Wash
ngton government will adhere strict
y to its policy of opposing the carry
ng of mounted guns by vessels ply
ng out of United States ports with
assengers. Under international law
nerchantment have the right to
noant guns for defensive purposes.
ut it is not expected that Italy will
nsist upon exercising that right over
he protest of the United States.
The quesion of responsibility for
afety of passengers aboard the ves- 0
el has been raised. The Italian am- e
,assador, it is said, contends that the s
runs afford protection to the pas- k
engers by defending the vessel from C
ubmarines. State department offi- c
vals on the other hand maintain that.
he. guns constitute an element of c
Langer which would not attend an a
narmed vessel. 1
