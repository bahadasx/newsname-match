MEXICAN SITUATION SHAKES CONGRESS
ENGINE TROUBLE
MR. BUSINESS MAN,
WHA T WILL YOU DO?
Mr. Business Man, this is a 810 matter to YOU—this question of
eliminating the preferential rate. WHAT ARE YOU DOING ABOUT
IT? WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT IT?
For years you have been asked to contribute to this and that fund to
attract tourists here, and all the time the biggest attraction of all, the
same round-trip railroad rate that Southern California gets, has been de
nied to Tacoma by the railroads allied with the Oregon-Washington line.
You, Mr. Business Man, who have been shipping traffic over the 0.
W., can do more in a day than the interstate commerce commission can do
in a year!
Why don't YOU, Mr. Business Man, make the 0.-W. explain why it
doesn't give YOU the same chance for your white alley as it gives Los An
geles and San Diego?

to present to the interstate com

"By bringing these Interven

"we can present our case to the

more forcefully than by any oth

"With equal round-trip rates

"With a preferential of |17.:,0

ness, and never will. The tourist
will take the Southern routes, be
cause he can ride over those lines
$ 17.50 cheaper, and will leave

At-that time the public service
commission and the various com

the case, each from Its own angle.
The case then will be argued
before the interstate commerce
commission in Washington, D. C.
It became known today that
one of the biggest Bteaniboat
transportation men In the North
west has severed connection with
the Oregon-Washington Railroad
ft Navigation Co. until officials
of that road agree to do all in
their power to prevail upon their
allied lines, the Union and South
ern Pacific, to compromise with
the Northern lines In the matter
of passenger rates.
Bring Prcwaure Direct.
Another shipper, who was
about to sign an agreement with
the O.W. for delivery of 60 car :
loads: of merchandise, has held
up the denl until he has had a
consultation with officials of the
road on the rate case.
It miiy take years to carry t lie
case through the commlMlon and

they thenmelves can obtain quick

WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 19.
—After a hot fight the foreign
committee and the administra

the senate. The subject has
shaken the whole administration
to Its foundations.
A majority of the committee
was against reporting a favorable i
intervention of the resolution.
Sen. Borah, Impressed with the
strength of the administration's
position, decided that it was Im
possible to force the Mexican sit

ROTARY
IN RATE
BATTLE
Among the organization which
are ready to take a hand In the
fight for fairer rates is the Ta
ciiriiu Rotary club. The executive
board at its meeting tomorrow
noon will take up the question
and probably will make plans to
intervene In the legal action to
wipe out the ureferntial.
"This iireferntial was the on*
great obstacle in the way of
bringing Rotarians from all parts
of tlie country to Tacoma and the
northwest last Rummer at the
time of our convention in dan
Francisco," said Secretary Wood
bridge today.
"Of 1,200 delegates, only 400
arranged to return to the east by
way of the northwest, just be
cause the rates were far higher
by way of Tacoma than by the
southern route. Most of them
had gone to San Francisco by way
of San Diego and would un
doubtedly have returned by the
northern route if the rates had
been at all reasonable or fair.
"Scores of them told me they
would have liked to visit T«oma,
only it wbb too expensive."

Until a test 'case Is brought,

We'd like to call your atten
tion to a neat little phrase that
you can use to your advantage
half a dozen times a day during
the next month. It is this: Til
take the matter under advise
meht."
JadgM and coiiiiciliiion and bank presidents nnd others make fre
quent use of the formula, M yon know and all of ns know who have
dealings with siicli dignitaries.
The way we suggest your nsin^ ii la as a reply to the thousand and
O&e <andidait's who infesi OUT fair city at the present moment, along
with Ilie Klipi the cold snap and other discomforts. When one of these
office seekers comes to yon and asks your promise to support him, talk
with him long enough to learn his views nnd to judge of his capabilities,
I hen reply:
"I'll take the matter under ;ul\ isement."
The reason we suggest the plan is that the coming election is going
to be a mighty important one for Ta :om;i, The next city council will be
called on to meet many big problems. One of these problems that must
not be overlooked is the traction problem.
Two of the most important franchises held
by the Tacoma Railway and Power Co. will ex
pire during the term of the next city council.
These are the franchises for the major parts of
the South Tacoma and Point Defiance Lines.
A city council that possesses intelligence, an understanding of the
terms "public service" and "public utility" and a spine will be able to
bring this stubborn 19th century corporation completely to time. It can
force it to heat its cars, to extend its lines into territories not now serv
ed, to run a more frequent schedule and in other ways to come up to
date.
Another wishy-washy council such as we now are cursed with can
continue selling the city's birthright as fast as it matures to this selfish
Boston syndicate.
THIS ISSUE MUST LOOM LARGE IN THE COMING OAM
PAIGN. MAKE IT LOOM LA I WE. MAKE THE CANDIDATES
UNDERSTAND THAT THEY MUST DECLARE THEMSELVES
ON IT. IF THE PRESENT CHOP OF CANDIDATES DOES NOT
MEASURE" UP TO THE STANDARD, WAIT FOR THE SECOND
CROP. DON'T PROMISE YOUR VOTE TO ANYBODY YET.
Take the matter under advisement!
