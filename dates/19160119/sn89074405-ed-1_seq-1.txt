IrtBttence for
war, by tile government manufacture
of all war munitions, was urged in

republican,' of Iowa..
He pleadedgfor prompt adoption of
his resolution,' which would authorize
a special committee to Inquire into
the most feasible plan for acquiring
and constructing plants to supply the
army and navy with all arms and am
munition and equipment including
ships and to report on legislation
necessary to prevent private manufac
ture of such products.
"I agree that war may eome to the
country," Cummins declared "but If
it comes, It must be the result of the
calm, dispassionate, loyal purpose to
meet the awful scourge because there
Is no other way of defending our civ
ilization, our instructions and our
honor.
"I do not assert that every person
or corporation which may profit from
war would incite war, but I do a«sert
that all such persons and associations
are not competent to judge the con
troversies which may lead to conflict,
and Inasmuch as they cannot be re
moved from the great panel of the re
public, they ought to be removed from
the business out of which the interest
glows.
"It ought to be made impossible.
*o far as the power of the government
is concerned, for any man or corpor
ation to make money out of war.
"We .need Just now, above all other
things, a re-baptism In Americanism.
To me, Americanism means fidelity to
American interests, loyalty to Ameri*
can institutions, pride In our past and
confidence in our future. It means a
spirit that commands men to live for'
their country, and if necessary, to dls
for It but I, for one, am not willing
that Americanism, shall be defined and
standardised by millionaire. munition
makers or by the brokers, bankers or
backers who share their bloodstained
profits.
"In this crltfoai moment, what la
the attitude of the makers of arms
and munitions? Without exception,
so far as I know, they are insisting on
the most comprehensive program
jrtiich it is possible, to conceive, and
they are employing, through all the
channels, and all the instrumentalities,
which would mould publis thought,
all the forces at their command for
completeness of preparation which
would turn this country into a mili
tary camp and practically destroy all
ambition, save the ambition to over
come by force of arms the entire
world."

cannot be regarded as anything like an adequate offset to the«lfect of
the incident on relations between Sweden and Great Britain.
Some Swedish newspapers state that such actions are wane than
open rupture. Hjalmar Branding, socialist-leader in the second Swed

Turks have suffered heavily.
Good progress is also being made In
