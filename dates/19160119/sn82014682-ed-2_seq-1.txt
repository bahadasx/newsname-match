later his prostrate body was found ly

Mi own door, and soon after, being
taken to the hospital he died.
That a brutal murder was commit

the conrtttlon of authorities at the
military post a conviction strength
ened by the finding in a nearby bath
house of a heavy Are poker, smeared
with grease and dirt, to which a num

George, who had been for many
years in the employ of the quarter
master's department, was a small,
frail old man more than 60 years of
age. He lived alone In & little .house
In the rear of the barracks of the ma

' George, who made a practise of
loaning money to the soldiers, Is
known to have made large collections
since uayday last Monday. One sol
dier has volunteered the Information
that only last evening he paid George
$30. which the dead man put Into

money nor the purse was found on
the dead man, though his watch and
keys had not been taken.
The nearest living relative of the
dead man is said to be Mary Whit

vestigation of the affair is being made
by UeuL-col. G. G. Bailey, Quarter
master Corps, and.Capt V. B. Renzie-

of last night obliterated any traces
which George's assailant might have
left on the soft ground nearby.
U. S- District Attorney Horace W.
Vaughan has begun an Investigation
into the death of George.
The sheriff's office, claiming it has
do. jurisdiction as th affair occurred
on a military reservation, turned the
case over to the district attorney's of

with the judge advocate general's of
fice and othec military authorities to
ascertain the cause of the man's
death.
"If there is evidence of murder,' Mr.
Vaughan says, "the federal officials
will take charge of the case. ; If the
evidence points to manslaughter only,

OF ENGINEER AND MAYOR
"How Long Would Any Busi

ditions, He Asks
!' .
FYom a Honolulu businessman who
has been studying the question of mu
nici pal expenditures the Star-Bulletin
has received the following critical dis
cussion of the city's expenses, with
particular reference to the recent re
port of the grand jury:
"His Honor the Mayor and the for
mer road engineer having taken excep
tion to a recent report of the grand
jury, in so far as it relates to the
conduct of the road department. It
seems that the topic Is open for dis
cussion." The mayor simply says the
report if untrue, which leaves no room
for argument,; so far as he is con
cerned. We must simply take his
word for It arid let it go at that We
must, however, agree with the mayor
In-one respect. A certain four miles
of good road tout of the 86 miles In
question) was not mentioned specific
ally in the grand jury report. This is
very 'reprehensible. The grand jury
should have made that particular four
miles of -road the subject of their re
port. The city and county adminis
tration would j have been pleased and
the public happy In the knowledge
that lhere was an excellent road
around four miles of the Island of
Oahu. -' . ..
"The former road engineer has
pointed out certain points of the re
port In which the jury erred. One of
these is the item of $5720 expended
for equipment in the month of May.
This. It would seera. is ouite pro'ierly

U .Is true, that ne money was spent

Good roads, weather, Spokane, the
Carnival . and advertising were the
topics of discussion at the Ad Club
uncheon today at the Alexander
Young Hotel. Albion Clark was the
first chairman of an Ad Club commit
tee to report and he 6tated that the
Ad Club plans were- going along in
fine shape, despite the recent down
pours. . A
Harry Strange gave his report on
the decorations for the Carnival, stat-
ng that many of the merchants bad
cooperated in making the illuminating
plan a success. He also stated that
the Chinese and Japanese merchants
were going' to aid in the plan of dec
orated thoroughfares. The chairman
on the Stunt committee also stated
that Ad Club night on the opening, of
the Carnival would be a success.
When President Wallace R. Harring
ton introduced C. E. Smith of Sixkane
to the members of the club, he stated
that the visitor from the Inland Em
pire was a rich "planter." Mr. Smith,

and told of the formation of a club

Club that had done much for Cleve

Rev. J. L. Marquis of Meenah. Wis
consin created a secsation when he
stated that he enjoyed the rainy
weather very much, and added to this
by saying that it was a great change
from the weather In northern Wiscon
sin in the winter season. He con
cluded with the statement that the
Honolulu Ad Club is the best in the
world. ;
F. R. Ritchie of San . Francisco, a
paving contractor of that city, said
that he had come to Honolulu to get
away from the paving talk, but since
his arTival here had heard more dis
cussion on that subject than he did
in California.
President Farrineton announced
that next week would be road pro

this subject , would be listed for the
next luncheon.
FOR BIO LEAKAGE
Loss of Water From No. 4 Due
to Leak in Main Pipe, Say
Sedgwick and Larrison
LONG-FAMOUSJROUBLE
CAN NOW BE REMEDIED
Bad Pipes Can Be Repaired
and Rainfall Conserved in
Dry Weather
That the supposed seepage In Nuu
anu reservoir No. 4 is really: a leak
in the main pipe which leads out of
the reservoir, conveying water 'down
to the city electric .light plant, add
from the sluice pipe also, has recent
ly been proved by two water experts,
Thomas F. Sedgwick and George K.
Larrison.
Methods employed by the two men
to ascertain the cause of wacr los
fiom the reservoir consisted mainly
in shutting off the water from the
main pipe, a suggestion made by Mr.
Sedgwick, thus reducing the outflow
from two springs below the dam.
-Three springs exist below the dam,
two of which are beyond question di
rectly influenced by the flow in the
main pipe, and a third one which
seems to gather its water from a
swamp mauka of the main pipe and
not connected with, the pipe leak in
any manner. w
Mr. Larrison now believes that the
actual seepage from the reservoir
thrcugh the dam structure amounts to
practically nothing. He suggests that
the reservoir should be emptied and
the bad pipes repaired as soon a a
possible to still get value from the
wet season's ralna.
Two Pipes Drain Water.
Two parallel pipes lead out of the
reservoir, 'one going down td the elec:
trie light plant, and the other a much
shorter pipe serving merely as a
sluice pipe for cleaning out the reser
voir at intervals. The sluice pipe
opens at a valve some distance below
the dam.
"All credit is due Mr. Sedgwick,'
maintains Larrison "for the discov
ery. He merely asked me to go along
to corroborate the figures, which I did
willingly." , .

Maloney Was a farrier with the 4th
Cavalry and was 29 years of age. He
enlisted In Colorado and was serving
his second enlistment.
After renting a bathin; suit: at
Heinie's Tavern j-esterday morning
Maloney went swimming, and it wag
first thought he might have ben
drowned when the Japanese attendant
discovered U.te in the afternoon that
his clothes fere still in his locker.
Put on Suit Frly.
This was about 4 in the afternoon
and as Maloney went in the water, or
at least put on the suit about 7:30
yesterday morning, it was thought
strange he did not return, and after
brief investigation the disappear
ance of the man was reported to the
police.-.
When he rented the suit yesterday
Maloney was in rood spirits and was
laushing and joking with the attend
ant in the bathhouse. Before he wen
in he was told the sea was very rough
and dangerous, but would not heed
advice not to o th atT.
At an inquest this afternoon it was
decided that Malonev met death from
drowning. Physicians found no evi-
aence of heart disease, although one
theory of the man's death was .that
he died in the water from an attack of
heart trouble. An autopsy proved this
-to be incorrect.
