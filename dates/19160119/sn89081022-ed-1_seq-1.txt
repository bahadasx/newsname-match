WILLMAR OPERA
HOUSE DESTROYED
Bums to Ground Early Last
Thursday Evening.—
Big Loss.
The Willmar Opera House, lately re
modelled and improved, became the
prey of the fire fiend Thursday eve
ning. It was completely destroyed.
The loss is over $20,000 with $8,000
insurance, and is a had blow to the
principal owner, Mr. Alton Crosby.
The fire was discovered at 6:45 p.
m. Most of the members of the vol
unteer fire department were scattered
in their various homes eating their
suppers. They responded well, how
ever, and in a short time had three
streams of water playing on the fire.
Had some water at an adequate pres
sure been available at the first few
moments after, the fire was discovered,
the building might have been saved,
but after the fire had once taken hold
in the wooden interior and the stage
settings the building was doomed. The
most the fire department could hope
to do, was to confine the fire to this
building. This they were able to do,
owing to the fact that a light wind
was blowing.
The firemen found it impossible to
get at the heart of the flames owing lo
the great clouds of smoke which roll
ed forth when the stage doors were
opened. It was impossible for thewhat
firemen to penetrate very far into the
building.
Getting a good start, the flames
worked their way up the walls to the
roof, and the painted scenery furnish
ed plenty of fuel. In the roof the
flames broke through the steel ceil
ing and the roof, and with the draught
due to the ventilators, it was not long
before the entire roof was a mass of
flames.
The origin of the fire is a mystery,
altho judging from where the flames
were first seen after the alarm was
turned in, in all probability a short
circuit in the electric wiring was the
cause. When discovered the blaze did
not seem to be one of much conse
quence, altho the dense smoke made
it impossible to get at it and extin
guish it.
Fire fighting under the best of con
ditions is an unenviable job, and theLindblad
members of the local department who
fought valiantly against overwhelm
ing odds, with the thermometer at 30
degrees below zero, are deserving of
commendation*. Many hundreds of
spectators stood around the scene of
the fire which made a great spectacle.
The building and contents were val
ued at about $20,000, with $8,000 in
surance. Just the week before, Mr.
Crosby had installed an electric Foto
player, valued at $3,000. The only
things saved were valuable papers
taken from Mr. Crosby's office before
the fire secured great headway. The
south, west and north walls caved in,
leaving only the solid brick front
standing.
Four firemen remained on the scene
all night, and a stream of water was
kept directed ort the smouldering
ruins.
The contents of L. Crosby's of
fice on the south side of the building
were not harmed by the blaze Thurs
day evening, but the fire broke out

e*J
*"'ng about ten o'clock Friday
u-°ciet and before they were extin
guisher that office had been wiped
out, also.
The motion picture machine, which
was enclosed in the fire-proof booth,
was melted into an unrecognizable
mass. The five reels of pictures,
shown at the matinee that afternoon
were also destroyed. That a fire
should break out in the building, was
the last thing thought of by Mr. Cros
by. The fact that there was no stove
or furnace in the building seemed to
be assurance in this respect.
It seems the irony of fate to think
that a building, situated as the Opera
House was, right under the city water
tower, should be totally destroyed by
fire. Many conflicting reports are in
circulation in regard to the condition
of the hydrants, etc. No hydrants
were found frozen, but the extreme
cold made it difficult and hazardous
to manipulate the hydrant after the
water had been turned on and for that
reason it was deemed expedient to at
tach but one hose to a hydrant.
Mayor Wellin states that he happen
ed to be standing back of the store
when he looked towards the Opera
House and saw a light through the
back door as if some one was burning
waste paper. He hurried across the
block, but before reaching the place
the alarm sounded and in a very short
time, which he estimates at eight
minutes, a hose cart had arrived, at
tached to the hydrant at the Spicer
corner and was ready to throw water.
The lack of water pressure was
due, it is explained, to the fact that
the water mains are in such condi
tion that it was deemed unsafe to
put on direct pressure from the pumps
to them. The only pressure was the
tank pressure and it was far from
it should be. One lesson from
the fire is that some additional means
for throwing water must be provided.
There was no attempt to use the old
fire engine, which the fire department
considers useless.
The adjoining buildings were not
damaged to any extent. The beauti
ful new bank building on the north
had a few cracks in windows which
damage was estimated at $500. Wig
gins' building sustained broken win
dows to the extent of about $100.
No definite plans have been made
for rebuilding the opera house, but
Mr. Crosby tells us that there is ev
ery reason to believe that arrange
ments will be made to rebuild on the
same site.

A N W LAKSON,
WILLMAR, MINNESOTA, WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 19, 1916
Mrs. Emma Sophia Ostlund was
born in Mamre township Oct. 17,1876.
She was the daughter of the late Mr.
and Mrs. J. A. Erlandson. and grew to
womanhood In that good old Mamre
home. On New Year's Day, eleven
years ago, she was married to Mr.the
Emil Ostlund. Their happy compan
ionship was suddenly cut short on
Aug. 29,1909, when Mr. Ostlund pass
ed away, and the lately deceased was
left a widow with one daughter, Eton
ore. Since the death of the husband,
Mrs. Ostlund has resided with her
brother, Albert and sisters, the last
few. years at Willmar.
The deceased is mourned by herhall
daughter, Miss Elenore Ostlund, two
sisters—Misses Mary and Lydia Er
landson of Willmar three brothers—
Erick Erlandson of Glenwood Albert
Erlandson, of Willmar and David Er
landson, of Howard, N. D. a large
number of brothers and eisters-at-law,
cousins, and other relatives. Among
these are two uncles—E. Bergquist of
LaBolt, S. D., and S. Erickson of
Mahtowa, Minn.
In the death of Mrs. Ostlund, her
many friends keenly realise their
loss, and sympathize deeply with the
bereaved ones. The departed was a
true friend, and her devotion to those
she loved would make a bright chap
ter in any life. Nothing but the thot
of the loving Hand that removed her
can reconcile them to her absence.
While she is gone from the scenes of
the pleasures and sorrows of life, she
will still live In the hearts of those
who knew her best Her retiring nat
ure led her to hide her best qualities
from public gaze, but they were re
vealed to those who enjoyed her ac-day
quaintance. It was in the home that
her true worth was most conspicuous.
She was brought up and confirmed in
the Mamrelund Lutheran church of
which she remained a faithful mem
ber until her residence at Willmar,
since when she has affiliated with the
Bethel church.
