Last Sunday, at II o'clock, Mrs.
Sarah E. Barger, after a long illness,
crossed over to the other side, the end
coming at the home of her daughter,
Mrs Ores Barger, who resides two and
a half miles from Columbia.
The deceased would have been 72
years,old had she lived until,the 3rd
of next May. She was the oldest
child of Anderson and Louvenia Mur
rell and was born and reared near
Clear Spring, this county. She was a
woman of strong mind and a well read
historian, and interesting person with
whom to converse. She was well
versed in local biographies, and was
often called upon by the jounger set
for histories of their descendants She
made it a business to keep up with
trees, so to speak.
When quite a young woman she was
married to Samuel H Stevenson, and
they commenced their married life in
Russell coduty, near Esto. To this
union three children were born, M. O.
Stevenson, Mrs. Ores Barger, who
live near Columbia, and Eev. R. E.
Stevenson, who is a citizen of New
Mexico. She also leaves a stepson,
Mr. G. M. Steven-son, of this place,
who never knew any other mother
The first wife of Mr. C. R. Boyse was
also a step-daughter.
Ten .years after, the death of her
first husband she was marriedjto Col.
D. B. Barger, a prominent citizen of
Russell county, who died eight years
later.
The deceased was a devoted mem
ber of the Methodist Church, and like
the true woman that she was, she
filled every station in life, that she
occupied, with fidelity.
The funeral services were held at
Mt. Pleasant church, Russell county,
conducted by Revs. Goodman and
Beck Monday, and thmtexaent was
near the church. KofWiTBtanding
the day was disagreeablyfild1, quite a
number of relatives and friends were
present.
The surviving children have the
consolation of knowing that their
mother was ready for-thecall, that she
is now free from pain, and will be at
the gate to welcome them when they
come to the celestial home.
Rules for Fighting Grip.
To escape the grippe avoid crowds;
keep away from persons who cough
and Bneeze. Don't ride when you have
only a short distance to go. Walk.
Get plenty of sleep, with window
open. Walk a mile every day In the
open air. If you get it keep by yourself
as much as possible. If you feel ill go
to bed and stay there. Send for a
reliable doctor. Cover your face when
sneezing and don't expectorate in pub
lic. See that your eating and drink
ing utensils are washed separately
from those of the rest of the family.
Don't take the patept grip remedies.
Mr. Thos. J- Rosson, who lived at
Rugby, this county, died one day last
week. His death was not unexpected,
as he had been confined to his bed for
months, a victim of pulmonary trou
ble. He was between fifty-five and
sixty years old, and was a man who
had many friends in the neighbor
hood. He leaves a wife, one son and
one daughter.
The American Magazine grows
more popular every day. The Febru
ary number is one of the best the com
3 pany ever issued and it should be' a
welcome visitor to country libraries
The information it contains is val
uable and of great interest. If you
are not a subscriber for the splendid
magazine you should send for it. Ad
dress 381 Fourth Ave, New York City.
One wing of the dam at Smith's
jcill, on Russell's creek, broke several
,eks ago, and it has been gradually
washing away since, until now but
little of it is left. The mill is being
operated altogether by an oil engine.
Mr. W. T. Price lost a Jersey heifer,
eighteen months old, last Wednesday.
She was well worth fifty dollars. She
was sick about one week, the 'skill of
i v a veterinary bringing no relief.
Mrs. R. E. Tandy sold W. E. Todd
five Bourbon Red turkeys which
brought her $14.50.
Born, to the wife of J. D. Holladay,
January 13th, a sob.
To citizens of Adair and Russell:
I have been thinking of all occupa
tions of life, and the one most needed
in our county is a good paper publish
ed, say the Adair County News, with
a man like Mr. Harris, who takes so
much of his time to advocate good
roads for our counties, and fo think
how little credit our peopj will give
him. Hold up your editors Jiauds, and
help him to do all the good he can for
our poor counties that need such help.
Don't kick on your editor, but help
him, and he will help us. We know
if we don't have a good live paper to
assist us in many things, we are in a
bad shape in this poor country. By
the help of The News we can make
this country c-ne of the best in the
world. We should go to work and Im
prove the fertility of our land so we
can make bur corn crop without any
fertilizer, sow clover an turn under all
the clover we can, and in a short time
we can make more corn without fer
tilizer than we are making with it,
and save hundreds of thousands of
dollars for the poor people of our coun
try. If a fertilizer agent were to ask
me to buy from him for my cwn crop,
I would tell him no. If a boy has
beenraised to put in more corn han
he can cultivate right, it will be hard
to get him out of that "idea, but as
soon as you can do so, it will be better
for you and our country, for it is bet
ter to put in Jess com and more clovor
and grass. Some old fathers will say
to their boys, that when they went to
school they had to split timber for
seats, and they seem to want their
boys uncLgirls to go through this world
just like they did. Now let us par
ents get out of this old fogy idea and
let our children have the best we can
afford, for life is too short to cut them
out of the great opportunities that we
can give them. Just think of the
boys pleading with their fathers to
bond our county for the purpose
of building better roads, and their
fathers saying no. Then your boys
will leave father and mother with
tears in their eyes, for the West,
where they can have some opportu
nity. Now let's build good roads,
good school houses, and give our boys
inducement to stay at home, where
they can be so much pleasure. What
is life? It is what we make it. I
have heard fathers say, my boys are
in the "West and if we don't get the
Dixie road I guess I will go too. I
hope as soon as their fathers go to the
West, that the boys will come back
to their good country where they were
raised. Just tfiink of Adair county,
one of the best counties in the State,
not voting for good reads! Those who
voted against the iond3ssue,rwill see
the day when they can look back and
see how little they kn.ow. The 'bonds
are a very little thing-for you to pay.
You would never know the difference
when you paid) it. We have been pay
ing tax and nothing to show for it.
Now lets do something that we and
the rising generation will be benefit
ted, and our poor farmers can make a
living for their children.

To Teachers.
The common school law absolutely
forbids any teacher to teach on Sat
urday. Saturday teaching will not
be counted. Teaching a holiday
counts no more than any other .day
and lost time can not be made up by
teaching holidays. Arbor Day can be
taken as a holiday provided the teach
er and pupils meet and render some
sort of a tree day program, or at least
plant a few trees. Otherwise it must
be taught as any other day. Outside
of holidays, and school rally days at
tended by the teacher and school, the
full time must be taught in order to
receive full pay.
Very Respectfully,
Tobias Huffaker, Supt.

At the opening of circuit court
there were representatives here from

Adair county courts are invariably.
largely attended. More people means
more business.
During circuit court we ask all sub
scribers who are behind at this office
to call and make payment. This no
tice also applies to parties who are
owing for job-work and advertising;
Miss Mary Pierce, daughter of the
late Rev. Jo Pierce, Roy, this county,
was recently married to Mr. Charles
J Evans, of Russell Springs.
The swarm at Gill & Waggerner's

the store has been like a bee hive. v
