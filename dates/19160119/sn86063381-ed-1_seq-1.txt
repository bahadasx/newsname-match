WOMAN'S STUDY CLUB
TO BE RELIEVED
Highway Resolution Adopted Band
Reported to Be in Need
of Money.
The city council will be asked at
its next meeting to make arrange
ments for the city to take hold of
the rest room after March 1.
This was decided at a meeting of
the Commercial club last evening at
the Commercial club rooms.
R. H. Schumaker, president of the
club, appointed E. H. Denu, W. N.
Bowser, E. H. Winter, H. H. Mayer
and H. E. Reynolds to attend the
next meeting of the city council to
present the matter of the mainten
ance of the rest room to that body.
The Bemidji Merchants association
will also appoint a committee to at
tend the meeting.
Study Club Retires.
The action taken on the rest room
situation was the result of a com
munication from the Woman's Study
club stating that the organization de
sired to be relieved of the responsi
bilities of maintaining the rooms. The
expenses amount to about $500 a year
and this money in the past has been
solicited from the business men. The
women asked to be relieved from the
work when the year closes, March 1.
Other Cities Have Rooms.
It was pointed out by several mem
bers of the Commercial club at the
meeting last evening that other cities
are providing rest rooms and that a
rest room is of benefit to every citizen.
The club passed a resolution on the
proposed route of the Jefferson high
way through Beltrami county. The
resolution was the same as passed by
the city council Monday night and
provided that the highway extend
from Bemidji, north to Kelliher and
Baudette and Spooner. A copy of
the resolution was mailed to the
state highway commission which will
meet next Monday. A similar reso
lution will be passed by the Bemidji
Merchants association and other or
ganizations in Beltrami county.
Means Good Roads.
It was pointed out at the meeting
last evening that one of the excellent
features of the route passing through
this county was that it would insure
the maintenance of the roads in the
county.
J. L. George, county auditor, will
attend the meeting of the highway
commission next week.
Short of Funds.
H. E. Anderson of the Bemidji band
advised the Commercial club that the
band was short of funds and that it
had several expenses that must be
met immediately. He pointed out
that last spring business men agreed
to pay $108 a month for the main
tenance of the band. Since May 1
the band has only received $502 and
since the band has returned from the
state fair no money has been received
except from the proceeds of dances.
Get Tax Money.
The band will in a few months re
ceive about $800 from the tax levy
as provided for under a new law but
it was pointed out by Mr. Anderson
that there are many immediate ex
penses that must be met before that
time or the band will be forced to
disorganize.
Several business men present stated
that they had agreed to give to the
fund but that no effort was made to
collect it. Mr. Anderson was ad
vised to take the matter of securing
a collector up with the band and if
inside of a week enough money can
not be collected to report at the next
meeting of the Merchants associa
tion.
A. W. Johnson, manager of the
Minnesota Electric Light and Power
Co., was elected a new member of the
Commercial club.
