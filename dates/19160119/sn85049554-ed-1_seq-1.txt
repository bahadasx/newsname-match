Information obtained from prisoners ar

have arrived recently from the south
western front.
The loss of Lutsk and its two sister
fortresses in Volhynla was the first In
dication of tfta disaster that was to
oome to the Russians as the result of
Mackensen'p great drive. The loss of
Przemysl and even of Lemberg,slmply
meant that the Russians were retiring
from conquered soil but when the en
emy managed to force the czar's troops
out of the three defenses, it meant that
the gate to south Russia proper had
been forced.
The triangle at fortresses, of which
Lutsk is probably the most prominent,
was regarded by Russia as impreg
nable.
If the Austrlans actually are evac
uating the fortress they will probably
also retire front the rest of the Volhyn

there is no other way of defending our
