YOU NEED
POTASH
FOR FERTILIZING
And it is scarce, very scarce; none
from Germany now, the normal
source of supply. But you can get
Potash right hero at home in any fer
tilizer that contains COTTON SEED
MEAL.
Clemson College Bulletin No. 177,
1913-14, shows average analyses of
189 samples, as follows:
Available Phospohric Acid . .2.36 %
Ammonia .7.28 %
Potash (soluble in water) ...1.63 %
Cotton seed meal not only supplies
your soil with the desired amount of
ammonia, but also gives it POTASH
in the most desirable form and in an
amount larger than can be obtained
rrom any other source of ammonia.
In addition, it furnishes on the aver
*gc 2 1/3 per cent available Phos
phoric Acid, the other important ele
ment of plant food, which, however,
ls not generally appreciated.
Cotton seed meal makes a fortill
*er which feeds tho growing plant
[luring its entire lifo, and leaves a
most valuablo humus in the soil to
mstain succeeding crops. Cotton seed
meal contains all that the other
sources of ammonia have, and in ad
dition POTASH. Read tho follow
ing from recent Clemson Bulletin No.
17. Be wise and use COTTON SEED
MEAL in your fertilizer: '
"1. Por poor to ordinary land, an
application per acre of from 200 to
100 pounds of a mixture cdmposed of
1,000 pounds of 16 per cent Acid
Phosphate, 800 pounds of 7 per cent
Cotton Seed Meal, and 200 pounds
of Nitrate of Soda ls recommended.
This mixture should analyze 8.8 per
cent available phosphoric acid, nitro
gen equivalent to 4.6 por cent ammo
nia, and enough potash will be fur
nished by the Cotton Seod Meal to
give the mixture a content of 0.6 per
cent Potash. >
"2. On fertile soil, an application
per acre of from 300 to 600 pounds
of a mixturo composed of 1,200
pounds of 16 per cent Acid Phos
phate, 650 pounds of Cotton Seed
Meal and 150 pounds of Nitrate of
Soda should give good results. This
mixture should analyze 10.25 per
cent Phosphoric Acid, Nitrogen equiv
alent to 3.63 per cent Ammonia, and
0,19 per cent Potash."

U. S. SUBMARINE EXPLOSION.
Accident nt Navy Ya ni Costs Four
Deaths, Ten injured.
Now York, Jan. 15.-Four mon
were killed and ten Injured, live dan
gerously, in an explosion to-day on
the submarine E-2, while tho craft
was undergoing repairs in dry dock
at the Now York navy yard. One of
tho men killed was an enlisted elec
trician and the others civilian work
ers.
At least thrqe of the ten now In
hospitals aro not expected to live.
The dead are Roy 13. Seaber, elec
trician, second class. Cleveland; .las.
H. Peck, civilian, general belper,
Brooklyn; J. P. Schulz, civilian, ma
chinist, Brooklyn; Joseph Logan, ci
vilian, general helper, Brooklyn.
Terrille Detonation.
Tho detonation was terrille, but the
submarine Itseir, from the outside,
shows no effects.
The interior was badly shattered,
but so tight was the vessel's shell that
there was no means of escape for gas
and lt was more than an hour after
the blast before the work of recover
ing the bodies could be completed. A
ladder blown up through the conning
tower fell 150 ieet away.
The injured and one body were re
moved soon after the accident, but
three bodies far down in the craft
could not be reached until the gas had
been blown out by compressed air.
^oon after the explosion several naval
officers led a rescue parly, but were
partly overcome by fumes, lt was
then that compressed air pipes wore
run into the shell.
The number of men Inside the sub
marine at the time of the explosion is
not known deilnltely. About 20 wore
working on the craft.
Cause Not Known.
What caused the explosion has not
been definitely decided. Rear Admi
ral N. R. Usher, commandant of the
navy yard, after a brief investigation,
inclined to express an opinion. He
said:
"The men were working In the bat
tery compartment of the E-2, dis
charging the new Edison battries
through a rheostat to measure the
voltage, and the explosion occurred In
that compartment: Tho battery will
generate no kind of gas and there was
no gasoline on board. The engine
was of the oil-burning Dysel type."
Inquiry Board Appointed.
Washington, Jan. 17.-A court of
Inquiry was named by Secretary Dan
iels to-day to Investigate, determine
the cause and fix lire responsibility for
the explosion aboard the submarine
E-2 in the New York navy yard Satur
day, which camed the death of four
men and the serious injury of ten
others. A navy yard board appointed
by Roar Admiral Usher immediately
after the accident reported to the de
partment to-night that "the Investiga
tion was continued to-day, but It was
said too early to decide its outcome."
The court of inquiry will bo com
posed of the following officers, all of
whom have bad wide experience In
the various phases of submarine
work: Capt. W. H. G. Ballard, Lieut.
Commander H. G. Sparrow, Lieut.
C. S. McDowell and Lieut. Joseph O.
Fisher.
Members of the court will leave
Washington to-night for New York
and will begin the inquiry to-morrow.
A report is expected before the end
of the week.
The tragedy served to emphasize
the need of a laboratory equipped for
experiments with batteries, engines,
ventilation and other important paris
of naval vessels. The submarine E-2
had been used for testing tho new
Edison storage battery be.cai.se ll,e
navy had no other equipment ?ulta
ble for such purposes.

EXPLAINING VON PAPEN CHECKS
Embassy Says Payments Wore .Made
to Defend A newsed Persons.
Washington, Jan. 17.-Accounts ol'
tho Gorman embassy, lt bocamo
known to-night, prove, in the opinion
of embassy olTlcinls, that it Capt. von
Papen, recalled military attache, paid
any money by cheek to Warum* Horn
lt was not until after Horn had been
arrested and charged with b'owing np
tho Canadian Pacillc railway bride
at Vanceboro, Maine.
London dispatches have stated that
stubs lu von Papon's chock book, ta
ken from htm by the Brit igt authori
ties at Falmouth, showed a chock ? f
$700 drawn to Horn's credit tho .lay
after tho attache hud received $2,000
from tho Gorman embassy Accord
ing to the embassy accounts, it was
said $2.000 was paid to von Papen
within a few days after the explosion
nt Vanceboro lo defray expenses in
connection with the defense of Horn,
a German citizen.
It also was intimated at the embas
sy that if von Papen had paid money
t?. Hans Adam von Wedlll, indicted
in New York for alleged passport
fraud, it had been to assist him le
gally. Von Wodill fled altor hoing
indicted.
Officials of the State Department
have indicated ibat it waa Important
lo know whether tho paymert to Horn
Was made bo fore or after tho explo
sion. German oficiala had repeated
ly denied responstb'lity for tho action
of Horn, saying they never heard of
him until after ho had been arrested.
St. te Department offlclnls have Inti
mated that e\)dence which would
prove Hom ieee!veJ money from a
Goman sou ice before ho blew up the
bridge might result in diplomatic cor
respondence with Berlin.
In official and diplomatic circles
much intcreBl was shown to-day lu
additional details regarding tho eon
touts of the documents taken from
Capt. von Papen which purported to
show that payments woro made to
Paul Koenig, tho Hamburg-American
line official tried in New York for
conspiracy, and to von Wedlll. In
Teutonic diplomatic circles no at
tempt was made to deny that suoh
payments had been made. Koenig, lt
was pointed out, w?t$ "ongagod In do
tectlvo work," and lt was to be ex
pected that he would be paid.
Tho embassy expects that some

formation contained in press dis
patches will shortly bo made from
