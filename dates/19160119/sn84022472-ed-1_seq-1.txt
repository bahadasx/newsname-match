Submarine Expert Applies
. Principle of Dredging
For Treasures.
Simon' Lake, the submarine author
ity, may extend his pleasure trip at
Asheville, N. C., to a more profitable
purpose in - the--quest of gold, is the
statement of his son, Thomas Kdison
Lake, today. ;, . - i
This will not be the first time that
the noted inventor has bent his ener
gy and brains,- towards- the recovery
of the precious metal, for he has pre
viously been active in the same local
ity and has invented and built apparw
atus which will take the: yellow har
vest from,' sunken vessels and at the
mouths of rivers where the . current
is too swdft for the placer opera
tors.- - . . ;-. - -
It Is known ' tha t extending ' north
from Dahf onega, Ga., once the seat
of a United States mint, through, the
Smoky mountain ridge and" the Blue
Rjtdge Mountains of Virginia, gola
has been found In small quantities
from time Immemorial. In fact, be
fore the days of '48, Georgia and
North Carolina were the chief sources
of deposit. After the" California rush
It was not found profitable to mine
in the east and the old claims were
abandoned. ,
Recently improved-- machinery has
made possible . the workings of many
of the older mines, and ."panning"
along the creeks and ' rivers where
fine gold deposits are found.
' With tHe purpose of facilitating this
work, Lake has invented a dredge that
works on the suction principle and
with as sharply pointed nozzle can
reach the interstices between rocks,
under water, where the fast current
has deposited the richest caches.
The Lake gold-dredging apparatus
Is so arranged that separation of the
gold grains or particles takes place
immediately. The - heaviest particles
are collected in a separator in the
working chamber, and other mater
ials, like sand gravel, small stones and
the lighter particles of gold are pass
ed through successive, separators as
the steam rises 4n .the tube to the sur
face. Lake, when he designed the first
dredge to be used in the section
where he is now visiting partly de
scribed the process as follows:
'With this system it is possible to
clean up the bottom thoreughly to
the depths of, 150 feet. The efficiency
of the pumping plant increases cbin
cideiVtly1 with the inclement of depth;
while with other systems, having the
pump , on tne suxrace, emciency is re
duced as the depth increases.
, -Morantown, N. C, is the district In
which Lake. is now said to be interest-;
ed in geld mining ventures.
LOEWE SALE OF
D ANBURY HOMES
Final Chapter in Famous
Suit Against Hatters is
Written Today.
TITLES ARE PROVED
BEFORE U. S. JUDGE
Original Defendants in Many
Instances Have Died Since
Case Began.
New Haven. Jan. 19-A motion
made by the plaintiff, in the famous
suit . of D. E. Loewe .and others
against W. P. Bailey and others,
which was a part of the Ianbury
Haters' case, for sale of property
of defendants against whom decrees
of foreclosure had been issued, was
granted by Juige E. S. Thomas in
the United States district court to
day. .''. . -
There remains now only the for
mal decree to. be made ending- the
case and this will come after a master
in chancery has sold each piece-of
property included in the order of
foreclosure, and turned in the pro
ceeds to tVe applied to the judgment
obtained, by the plaintiffs.
The question before the c6urt to
day. was. the order of sale under the
foreclosure. Walter G. Merxitt for the
plaintiffs, put in separately evidence
to prove title of defendants to prop
erty attached where the question Ijad
arisen as to priority of incumbence
on said property at the time attach
ment was made. " '
There were a. number of titles to
be proved of" this description. Then
Mr. Merritt made a general state
ment covering pieces of property at
tached - in which the" titles were not
subject to question as to priority of
incumbence at . the time attachment
was made.
Mr. Merritt said the plaintiffs drop
ped a savings bank of Danbary as a
defendant. Among titles proved were
several In which the original defend
ant has died.
After Mr. Merritt had made a gen
eral - statement covering all titles, W,
SET. Tammany, of Norwalk, offered the
following motion-which was not op
posed by the plaintiffs:
."The defendants.; in the above enti
tled action who are not owners of at
tached real estate or equities therein
respectively move that the judgment
hen vof ' the plaiiitiff s b foreclosed by
decree of sale Instead of by strict lore
closure and that such sale be by -ep-aft-ate
parcel." -.-'. r.
Daniel Tavenport, of 'counsel for the
plaintiffs, said that a formal carrying
cut - of the law under -the statute of
Mareh, 1893, with reference to fore
closure : sales- ordered by . the court
would -require' considerable time, but
that under the Connecticut statute the
,-.iiT- TTmT nnnnint us master in chan
cery; who, reports back to the court,
so that a formal decree may toe made.
The court "accepted the motion of the.
defendants and :thp attorneys will
agree on- the matter. : :
-!. E. ' Loewe, the principal plaintiff.
offered ta statement showing the sums
paid""upon the propositions., The last
payment ,was -$37,148. The Danbury
hatters' suit was brought in August,
1903, and final Judgment was entered
in : favor- of- the plaintiffs in the su
preme court of the United States m
January, 1915.'. The decree was for
$80,000 -which . carried triple damages
under, the 'Sherman law. The costs
have been $12,130.90. OriginallyJ there
were 204 defendants but the number
has been reduced by death or other
reasons to 180. ' : v
Foreclosure, proceedings run against
125 pieces of property , in Danbury and
15 each in. Bethel and Norwalk. ' .
There is a question still before the
court which will be settled when pro
ceeds' of the sale of property is turned
in as today's - disposition 'of about
$10,000 -in interest i on deposits of de
fendants in savings banks 'in Danbury
and elsewhere. - These savings which
were - garnisheed, amounted to $35,
S61.80... Opinion is said to be held by attor
neys for the plaintiffs that equities in
the property now under forclosure will
bring enough -to bring the total cash
close to the amount of the Judgment
with the funds already in hand. Pay
ments have been made on the judg
ment End only the balance is to be li
quidated. .

TRAGHOHA CASE
IS DISCOVERED
3INBRW8EP0RT
Local Jitney Driver's j,Sore
Eye Proves To Be Dread
:ed Diseasei
; A case of trachoma in this city has
been revealed, to the health authori
ties and steps probably will be taken
immediately to prevent a spread ' of
the disease. . . '
Nathan Bittner, aged 26; of 15 Ash
street, a jitney driver, . applied to the
emergency hospital this .. afternoon,
saying that he thought he had. som en
tiling in one of his eyes. When Dr.
J; F. Canavan looked at him, he was
shocked and ; to confirm his opinion,
he sent Bittner to--City Physician D.
C. ' DeWOlfe, an eye specialist. : Dr.
DeWolfe declared : Rittner has trachoma.-
.- .' : .-. '
He Was sent to hishome and the
health 'department was notified. Bitt
ner is- married and has two children.
He said he came from Russia, but has
been in this city. 10 fyears. v!
Trachoma, -is . a - scourge . that ' is
scarcely known in the eastern part
of the United' States, outside of the
region of the Appalachian and Blue
Ridge mountains. It is contagious ac
quired by physical contact, or through
articles" used by a trachoma victim.
Its visit - to Bridgeport is fraught
with peril and -it is expected examin
ation . will be 'made of relatives's of
Bittner in order that its progress may
be checked. . .-. Trachoma produces
blindness. .
It is known mostly among the In
dians of the west and in the ' Ken
tucky mountains. It is said that out
of every five or six Indians of Neva
da "are half -blind with it and the
spread of it is being neglected. In
one Kentucky place it was found' re
cently that 4.000 children had ' the
disease in more or less degree, 20 per
cent, of the whole population. ',
Trachoma has been traced to Egypt.
History tells us that when-. Napoleon
was fighting around the pyramids the
French, soldiers acquired , the Infec
tion and. when they returned to
France, they brought It with them.
Thence it spread like wildfire all over
Europe.
So serious did it become that the
United States Congress enacted a
measure refusing admission to would-
be Immigrants who suffer from the
Infection. The government maintains
a special Starr or agents in jcurope
to prevent the passage of persons af
flicted with it and It is said that an
agent who passes one of these persona
Is held responsible for what harm
may be done. '

Foe of Health in

East Bridgeport seems to be suffer

off an attack of another illness.
During the last two or three, days
physicians- have been receiving calls
from the home of many children who
are suffering mumps.
At. the same time, it is the belief
of many physicians in the city, that
the cold wave had the effect of lessen
