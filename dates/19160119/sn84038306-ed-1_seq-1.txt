curred this Wednesday afternoon
BIrs. Bladr baa been confined to her
bed for the past four years and now
the merciful hand of death has re
leased her from her earthly suffer

.'been critical and her life despaired of,

TEST YOUR SEED CORN.
Only 14 per cent of the Iowa corn
crop of 1915 is fit for seed, according
to estimates recently made by. the
government. In a normal seascn 51
per cent of tlie crop can safely be
used for seed. Lack of sufficient
maturity is given as the reason.
The average for the ten states in
the corn belt shows 29 per cent of
the corn fit for seed while the aver
age for the entire crop throughout
the country is 50 per cent.
There was a loss in yield in Iowa
amounting to 37 per cent because of
frost damage whereas in a normal
year the loss i» only 6 per cent. The
loss to quality was 55 per cent as
compared to 3 per cent in the usual
year.
These figures are the result cf a
special investigation conducted by
the bureau of crop estimates of
the government. Concerning the
reports on the corn fit for seed the
government's report says:
"The ideas governing the reporters
in their statements of- the percent
age fit for seed were not uniform.
Some apparently had in mind careful
selection of hdgh grade com others
the percentage of the total crop that
had not been damaged by frost to
such a degree as to destroy the
germinating power of the seed. The
figures regarding percentages fit for
seed therefore must be taken as ex
pressing largely the degree of less
from immaturity and frost damage in
corn, otherwise suitable for seed."
The reports from the other states
in the corn belt show that Indiana
and Missouri suffered less frcm
cold weather and frost than the oth
er states. In Indiana 60 per cent
of the corn is reported to he fi| for
seed and in Missouri 45 per- cent.
In Wisconsin only 4 per cent can be
used for seed, in Minnesota 5 per
cent, in Michigan 8 per cent and in
North Dakota 2 per cent. In Illinois,
35 per cent is fit for seed and ift
Nebraska 3.4 per cent/
a#*
seed botrf fof'^armers fre* of
and analyze other seed. -The. de
partment will not, however, test seed
corn for seed houses.
In order to insure the crop next
year the thorough testing of seed
corn is b«*ing urged.—Dubuque Tele

last Saturday which lie would not
care to repeat again. While putting
up an electric sign at the Haugh &

was standing slipped and Mr.
Matthews was thrown to the cement
sidewalk. Mr. Matthews fell a dis
tance of fifteen feet, and sustained
severe injuries to his feet and back.

his condition is somewhat better, and
that he will be able to leave his bed
soon.

EXPERIENCES OF
Prisoners Dig Tunnel Underneath the
Electrified Wire Fence Which
Held Men.
Readers of The Democrat will find
the letter from our special corres
pondent, Mrs. Norton, of intense in
terest. In the letter Mrs. Nortcn
relates the experience of a Belgian
soldier who was taken prisoner by
the Germans and held for about
a year. The conditions of the pris
on camp and the experiences en
countered in his escape are vividly
described by the Belgian soldier.
Following is Mrs. Norton's recent
letter:
London, England.
I had eon-} to India House, to see
the Belgian Military Attache, and
while waiting in the outer office, spi
ed, sitting across, from me an inter
esting looking Belgian soldier. He
looked lenely, and rather sad I
thought, so as the wait was long, I
crossed over and- spoke to him in
French. A smile lighted up his face,
as he responded, and we chatted
quite a little while before the sum
mons came for me to leave. Before
saying "good-bye" to" him, I. had
his promise to take lunch with my
husband and myself the following day
and th« hours we spent with him cn
the next day, we shall never forget.
For thfl boy had a story— how inter
esting. a one I will leave you to
judge. He was an escaped war pris
oner, escaped from a prison camp
200 kilometres from the frontier of
Germany. Later after he had re
turned to the front he sent me back
the fallowing written story of his
escape, or rather liis two escapes,
which I am giving below just as he
wrote it to me, save that in paren
theses, I have added any details that
he has forgotten' to write but which
he had told me formerly. It would be
no wonder that he would fail to write
all the details, for he told me in
the same letter, that where he was,
back of the lines, in an old barn, he
was suffering with the cold so in
tensely that he could scarcely hold
his pencil1
"On the 4th of August, 1914, the
ship, "Daire Hill,' was stopped by
a. jGfqranan cruiser, at the entrance of
the river Elbe, and consequently tow
ed.-jBito Hamburg, Where said steam-
inaftlonayty/T expected to"bb
«d with tnF rtirt «f«w ^rew
concentration camp. Taking advant
age of my opportunity I managed to
slip away unheeded, and after travel
ing 400 kilometres by train, I reach
ed the Belgian border, where all com
munications were interrupted.
"The Germans had already invad
ed the country, it being the 5th of
Aug. I walked my way from the
frontier towards Liege, but when
arriving in the vicinity of the forts,
I was arrested by thp Germans, busy
already at bombarding the Belgian
forts. I was falsely accused of be
ing a 'franc tireur,' in other words,
of having, as a civilian, shot down
on the German troops.
"On^the morning of the 6th, 1
was marched out with a company of
other Belgian civilians, and only nar
rowly escaped being shot. (What sav
ed him was a mere caprice of one of
the officers, who hearing him speak
such excellent German, decided
from some generous impulse to spare
his life, possibly because he thought
anyone speaking his native tongue
so fluently deserved life.) Other un
fortunates as innocent as I, were
executed at 6 o'clock of the same
morning, a sight I shall always re
member, as seven of them were shot
n.ot thirty yards from us.
'At about 4 o'clock in tl.e after
noon, favored by a panic which en
sued among the Germans, owing to
a severe bombardment by the foits,
I luckily got away, and mixed up
with some Belgians, (civilians), who
were fleeing from the artillery fira
reached Liege, then fiercely bom
barded, the same night, and caught
the last train for Brussells.
'After my arrival home, I enlist
ed as a volunteer in our army, and
was sent into the firing line after a
month's training.
'One morning, at the Yser canal,
a fierce battle was raging, the Ger
mans charged with superior num
bers as usual. Around us nothing
but dead and wounded. Being in the
lines farthest advanced, we were
surrounded in no time and taken
prisoners.
"Three days afterward we were
conveyed to the prison camp of
'Friedrichsfeld' Wisel. Here condi
tions of life were deplorable. At the
brink of starvation and covered with
vermin, we could not correspond with
our parents for some time. I per
sonally, did not get any news until
three or four months later.
"A few days after my arrival in
Germany, some friends and I start
ed planning an escape. We dug a
tunnel underneath tlie electrified
wire which surrounded the camp. Af
ter ten days work at it, we had a
subway of nearly thirty yards leng,
and through it one day proceeded to
escape.. But no sooner did we get
out of the tunnel, than the German
sentries fired on us. Some of our
little party went cn, but were cap
tured afterward, others and amongst
these I was, thought it safer to
crawl back through the tunnel into
the camp and to await a more favor
able opportunity.
"About a month afterward, we went
out on a working party at a distance
of about fifteen kilometres from tlie
frontier, with the intention of escap
ing. We were quite ready to go, and
started taking the bricks out of the
wall which prevented us from getting
outside, when all of a sudden fif
teen sentries gathered around us

PRISON CAMP AFTER A YEAR
OF HARD EXPERIENCE.
AWFUL CONDITIONS ABE DESCRIBED
and 'told us-.-tpS keep quiet and not to
move, for otherwise they would shoot
us as dogs, they said. (ThPV had
been betrayed to the sentries by one
of their fellow prisoners.)
"The next morning we were sent
to a camp at a distance of about 200
kilometres fnm the Dutch front'er.
"One side of the head was shaved
off, one blue and one red sleeve
sewn into our coats, and other dis
ciplinary measures taken. The
"Sennelager," (the name of the
camp), was a dreadful place, tlie con
ditions being much worse than in
'Friedrichf ft Id.' Tl:e accommoda
tions were disgusting, and the food
uneatable. Our usual dish used to
be turnip soup.
One morning I went out to clean
an automobile belonging to Gen. Von
Prodewold, command of tlie ccmp.
I was so lucky in this car, to find a
road map, of which I scon tcok pos
session. Later a Russian prisoner of
fered me a compass needle cne day,
fcr a piece of 'potato bread.' This
helped me a great deal later cn when
I had escaped from the camp.
"On tlie 30th of October, I disguis
ed myself undre my other clothes as
a German workman, and managed to
get out of the camp. (This was Oct.
30, 1915, a year after his being in
terned at this camp.) I was one of
a party employed in digging pota
toes.. Taking advantage cf a mo
ment's inattention on the sentries
part, I ran into a wood close by. ...I
had the time to take off my coat,
and by that was changed into a Ger
man mechanic, by my clothes under
neath. A.little 'rucksack,' with ten
biscuits /and two pounds of choco
late had previously been hidden in
a part of this wood. I soon found it
and thus equipped I ran for about
twenty minutes until I reached a
small wood where I lay hidden until
night oame.
"1 then took a road in nearly an
opposite direction to the frontier and
marched about 40 kilometres the
first night. Next morning,I continu
ed my road, but in the right direction
I took tho train and traveled by rail
way nearly 50 kilometres without be
ing annoyed. I was sitting along
side German soldiers and talking to
them (He spoke German just like a
native, to which in all probability he
owed his escape.)
"The same night after leaving the
train I lost myself, for it was very
dark, and I had no matches to look
at my map. About 8 o'clock a Ger
man soldier came along and showed
me tlie road. (The soldier told us
that this German soldier must have
been unusually stupid, or he would
have noticed something wrong about
so young a man being in workman
clothes, rather than in uniform.)
"The following day I kept Ridden
in a thick wood. It was Sunday,
and it would have been madness to
walk about as I was dressed, and
dirty as my clothes were. But as
soon as darkness came 1 proceeded
on my way again.
"On 'All Saints' day I had a lot of
rain and the roads were very bad. I
durst not ihelter myself and was na
tBrally wtf for four follow-
«y. it jns dMzzlfeag and -raining
nnany. On the- Tuesday
tured into the town of Emsdetten,
and bought an electric pocket lamp
and some sausage, for my biscuits
were soaked and reduced to paste.
"Continuing my way through the
marshes I reached a place only 10
kilometres away from the border.
(His sea training was invaluable
to him in guiding his course, at
night by the stars.)
"There walking about 2 o'clock at
night, along the railway embankment,
I fell down from the railway track
about twenty eight feet, and hurt
myself very badly. I intended to
surrender, as I was totally discourag
ed, I shouted and called out but
nobody was near. (He told us that
weakened as he was by lack of food
and exposure, the shock of the fall
took his last bit of resistance, and
that as he says, he literally shouted
out for some one to make him again
a prisoner, but fortunately for him
no one was near.)
"I succeeded at last in drag
ging myself to a wood, where I laid
for forty eight hours in the rain. As
my arm got better, I decided to risk
it and try to cross the frontier. I
threw my boots away and walked
bare-footed through the bogs, some
times far above the knees in the
mud. I reached bog pasture grounds
an,d guessed I was close to the bor
der.
"After creeping on my hands and
knees for about two hours, I heard
some one who I supposed to be the
sentry, and lay very still, hearing
too the dreadful baying of the blood
hounds. However, I remembered
that the bloodhounds were kept on
duty only from ten to twelve at night,
so after they had gone, I watched to
see where the sentry was, being
able to see his location when he
struck a match, then knowing that
the sentries were 100 yards apart I
estimated the distance between the
two and crept under the barbed
wires, that separated me from lib
erty.
(By the time he reached Holland
soil, it was getting light, and he was
able to see the Dutch sentries, but
they were wearing gray uniforms,
which gave him a dreadful fright, as
he thought they were still wearing
their blue uniforms, "so thinking that
there were two
rows
1%er
of German
sentries, he again carefully wormed
Ms way past them, and at last was
free.)
"After a fine reception by the
Dutch people. I was sent by my con
sul to Rotterdam, thence via Till
bury, to Folkestone.
"I was granted eight days furlough
wMch was just expiring when I mpt
Mrs. Norton, at the Legation, where
^ccerted
so kind in-if"tion."
Remy. our Belgian friend, is back
now at tbe front, fighting asain for
Hs homeland, and as he writes us,
"with everything to he thankful for."
