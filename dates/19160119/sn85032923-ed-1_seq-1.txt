inine vote was shown by the decisio
to appoint the ladies on the member
ship committee and arrange for
good orchestra and a dance to follow
the regular business of permanent

county central committee, called the

those who were interested in th
building up and maintaining of a con
structive policy for the protection of
American labor and American indus
tries, the maintenance of American
dignitv, and the safety of American
citizens throughout the world. He
urged, especially, that republicans in
office be allowed to remain in the
background and the control of the
club be left to others.

a temporary secretary to arrange for
a meeting at which a permanent or
gauization might be effected. Richard

the meeting and A. II. Powers as sec
retary.
