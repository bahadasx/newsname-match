OATH TAKEN BY

SffSIWITNESS SIUS JENKINS
Sensational Testimony Of
One Who Was a Member
Of the "Lodge."
PRES .JHNKIXS ALSO WITXKSS
Bowling Green, Ky Jan. 14.
Tho cruel and Inhuman punishment
Inflicted upon their victlniB, together
with the workings of the organized
hand of "possum hunters" In But
ler and JIuhlenberg counties, were
revealed here at the trial of George
Sweezer, one of the men under In
dictment In Butler county. Tho
cases were transferred to Warren
county on a change of venue.
The case of Sweezer Is the second
of nine rases to come before tho
court here. Pres C. Jenkins, tho
leader In ids Immediate locality, al
ready has been convicted and Is un
der a four-year sentence.
The sensation of tho two trials
came when Silas Jenkins, one of the
men under Indictment, told on the
stand of tho workings of the "lodge"
known as the "Amalgamated Order
of the World," better known in
JIuhlenberg county as "possum hunt
ers." He stated In substance that
tti6 oath administered required
"obedience to all orders of the pres
ident of the local, whenevr nnd
wherever given, either night or day,
attendance at all meetings when
called, eveept when sickness prevent
ed," and an Injunction, "not to re
veal any secrets or work of the or
ganization." This oath, ho said, was taken
I'pon bended knees before an altar
of pistols, rope, halter and a strap
The candidate was given to under
stand that the pistols and the halter
were for those on tho Inside should
they violate their oaths, and the
strap for outside work. Tho symbol
of membership was a small safety
pin worn on tho left lapel of the
coat, signifying "safety first."
Vil There were signs of various kinds.
Vie was known as the "courthouse"
-w, consisting of tho rubbing of
. Qlejt hand on tho left lapel of tho
Jft." This sign was for use in tho
furtroom and used as a signal to a
juror that tho prisoner at tho bar
was a member of the order, thus
giving him protection, Jenkins said.
Used in this Instance, the Juror "was
to use his utmost to clear the pris
oner, and it was his duty to so vote.
The grip was tho grasping of tho lit
tlo finger of tho right hand. When
meeting in the woods, as a sign of
recognition in tho dark,' tho word
codo was "Hay, hoe."
Jenkins stated that tho order orig
inally was started In August, 1914,
for tho purpose of bettering prices
for the products of tho farm, tho
advancing of the Interests of the
farmers in general and the amicable
settlement of disputes between mem
bers, and that the night-riding feat
ures wore brought into Butler from
JIuhlenberg county.
Pres C. Jenkins, who is still hero
In Jail awaiting the mandate of tho
Court of Appeals, which affirmed the
Warren Circuit Court, was Intro
duced by the Commonwealth. Ho
paid he was president of his local,
which had 14 members. At his trial
Inst fatl he denied any connection
with the night riders or any whip
pings, but to-day admitted having
takon part in three raids, at tho last
of which, ho said, some eight or ten
were whipped.
Jim tf.ay, negro-, tho main witness
for tho Commonwealth, told of the
treatment received by him at the
hands of alleged "possum hunters."
k In substance he said: "I was nwak-
entd about 3 o'clock ft tho morn-
fcA o of tho first Saturday In Novem-
voerv ! " io uruuKiiig in oi my
A largo number of men,

0ld m,HBKe golBg to hang me.
I did iBf tBt- I tBwl WBS
told to hug the pole, and my hands
wero strapped to it. A negro then
rolled my night shirt to my should
ers, nnd tho whip was applied un
mercifully to my naked skin. It was
a strap four inches wide. Thoy told
me they wero going to apply the
whip 160 times, and I guess they
did, at least I fett ilka It was ap
plied that many times, and It was
six months before I fully recovered
from that fearful beating.
"How many were In tho crowd?"
ho was asked.
"I don't know. There were a
great many. They said there wero
1,000. There must nave been 300
or 400."
"What did they do after1 whipping
you?"
"One man led mo toward my
house and a number followed. I
was told to go homo."
"What did tho rest do?"
"They disbanded, some going one
way and some another."
"Were you blindfolded?"
"Yes, when they led mo from the
house a handkerchief was placed
about my eyes, but I could see."
"Did you recognize any one?"
Hero tho witness answered In the
affirmative, naming most of the
men under Indictment.
"How did you recognize them?"
"I could see them, nnd then l
know their voices. I have known
some of them all my life."
Tho developments of tho day wore
the most sensational In the history
of the county, and tho nature of the
oath and the workings and signs of
tho "possum hunters" wero revealed
for the first time In any court In this
section.

LAW TO RESTRICT
AMERICAN TRAVEL
Is Urged By Bryan In the
Commoner.
WOULD NOT PERMIT VESSELS
Bearing Citizens Of This
Country To Get Clear
ance Or Land.
.MENACES THE XATIOX'S PEACE
Lincoln, Neb., Jan. 11. W. J.
Bryan calls on Congress to enact
without delay a law which will pre
vent .American clearance or entry of
belligerent ships that carry Ameri
can Dassengers.
Further, until such a law is In ef
fect, he would restrain American";
from traveling on such ships. A
signed editorial appearing In the
present Issue of the Commoner con
tains Mr. Bryan's opinion of tho
sinking of tho Persia. It says:
"The sinking of the Persia, which
has brought to our overburdened
President a new embarrassment,
and to tho Jingo press a new oppor
tunity to shed their red ink on im
aginary battlefields, calls for Imme
diate action bv Congress not a dec
laration of war, but a measure of
protection against war.
"American citizens should not bo
permitted to ,travel on belligerent
ships. Why should an American,
by liis foolhardiner.s, drag his coun
try into war or even to tho verge of
a diplomatic break? If he ha3 jio
consideration for his own safety or
for his Government's welfare, ho
should bo restrained by law.
"What would wo think of a citi
zen who, in time of riot, Insisted on
mingling with the mob while the
JIayor was trying to restore order?
Xilttlo attention would be paid to his
right to walk the streets at such a
time. t
"And so to-day, when tho world
Is In a riot, when Europe Is a r.lau
ghter house, and when the blood of
the slain reddens the sea beyond tho
three-mile limit this is no time for
Americans to talk about the asset -tion
of rights In such a way as to
menace the Nation's peace. It Is time
to consider duty to country and to
fellow citizens. And, since some nro
either too blind or too unpat
riotic to do this. It Is the duty of
Congress to act, and to act at once,
before now complications arise.
"Tho Captain of a belligerent ves
sel may at any moment forfeit the
lives of many passongers by trying
to escape, of by making resistance.
Why should American citizens be
permitted to take such risks,
when they risk their Nation's peace
as well as their "own lives? This
nation Is not seeking a cause for
war: then why permit a fow citizens
to supply material for sensational
papers?
"Belligerent ships should bo do
nled clearance or entry If they car
ry American passengers. That will
keop this country out of any con
troversy that may hereafter bo raised
by submarine warfare. But to make
certainty doubly sure, clearance and
entry should bo denied to tho pas
senger ships of neutral countries
Including our own if they carry
contraband with passengers. Pas
sengers are entitled to tho entire at
tention of tho ships' officers at u
time like this. Tho thoughts or the
officers should not be diverted from
caro of passengers to caro of contra
band cargo.
"Congress should act at once!"
