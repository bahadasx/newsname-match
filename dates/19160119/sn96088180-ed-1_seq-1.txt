Carranza Starts Campaign of
Extermination of Villistas
Who Had Part in Outrages
Against the U. S. Miners
El Paso, Jan. 1 9. Carranslsta or.
rs to how no mercy to VI1IIU
tmirdurrrs has struck ttirror to the
heart of tho bandits. Moreover, dis
play of tho torn corpses of General
Jlodrlguos and Baca Vallea at tho
Junrei customs house as a warning
to their companions In rapine and
bloodshed bos served the salutary
::r": ;e n
the mountains.
Meanwhile Carranslsta authorities
are confident that tho campaign of
extermination against Vllllstss will
1 satisfactorily avenge the murders of
18 Americans at Santa Ysabel.
' Knrlquo Cleneros, captured with
Iiaca Vallea, Is slated as tho next vic
tim of the Carranslsta gunmen, and
his corpse will be stac ked up along
side the other two rebel chieftains, so
that all "who run may read."
The fear of the firing squad has
apparently gripped the bandits, for
according to some witnesses both
Rodrlguex and Valles grovelled In
the dirt, pleading for their' Hves As
the stories went, though, tho gun
men showed no quarter, but Instead
fired at the prostrate men, ending
their pleas In a death shriek. The
object of the great bandit hunt in
the mountain fastnesses of Chihua
hua and Durango Is to capture Gen
eral Villa himself. Carranza leaders
believe that If they can eliminate him
the Inst vestige of outlawry and
guerilla warfare will crumble almost
overnight.
The Carranxistas say they will be
satisfied only when they are auto to
display the rebel chieftain's bullet
riddled body. To this end, the Car
rantlstaa have picked a band of their
most fearless men, with orders to
pursue their hunt relentlessly night
and day with this sole objert In view.
Villa was last reported In his old
haunts In Durango, and authorities
are confident that he can not escape
for long from their retribution.
GREEKS TO LEAVE
Athens, Jan. 19. All Greek
troops, except a battalion, will be
Vuhdrawn from the Bulgarian fron
tier, It was officially announced to
day, becauso of the difficulty of pro
visioning them. At the same time,
It was announced that England has
agreed to export 5,000 tons of coal
to Greece, thereby eliminating possi
bilities of a tle-pp of the railroads.
A British stoamer transport filled
with Serbian troops has reached
Salonlkl from Albania to co-operate
with the Anglo-French forces.
It is posslblo that reasons other
than shortage of provisions actuated
the withdrawal, particularly in view
of the fact that the allies recently
urgod withdrawal from both the Sor
blan and Bulgarian frontlors.

BULGAR
FRONTIER
Washington, Jan. 19. The war de
partment had no word thla afternoon
to confirm the Douglas, Arls., reports
that Mexicans had seised seven Amer
ican soldiers, but It was expected that
an official ' report would be neces
sarily slow, as it baa to be transmit
ted first to General Funston at Hous
ton. General Scott, chief of staff, said
that United States soldiers are not
authorised to cross the (border, but
must first wire the state department
for permission. If any crossed, as
reported, they probably were troop
ers, not officered.

ANOTHER FAREWELL
T
London, Jan. 19. All the dia
bolical plots in the world can not
keep Madame Sarah Bernhardt from
maklug another "farewell tour" of
America, she assures the united

"But I defy them. 1 would have

physicians' orders. I will go In Octo-

In America, it must bo. It is a fate

Rome, Jan. 19. Austria Is plan
ning to unite Montenegro and part
of old Serbia in a new kingdom un
der an Austrian protectorate, it was
reported here today. Germany is
said to have sanctioned this plan, and
Emperor Frant Josef is now consid
ering selection of a ruler who will
conciliate the Serbs and Montene
grins and remove forever the Balkan
danger on Austria's right flank.
Serbian refugees denied that Ser

Montenegro In making peace, thus
aiding in the program of unification.
They admitted that Austria made
overtures several weeks ago to Ser
bia, but they were rejected and have
not been renewed.
FIRE INSURANCE
AGENTS ARE "EASY
Portland, Jan. 19. Just to prove
that he could get insurance on any
thing, Fire Marshal Stevens an
nounced today that 80 fire Insurance
companies had written policies ag
gregating $25,000 on an old fireman's
helmet and a grand Jury subpoena.
This culminated a long-standing
fuBS between the Insurance men and
Ore officials. Eagerness of Insur
ance companies to write Insurance,
firemen declare, has caused the form
ation ot coaat-wtde arson "trusts,"
making a business ot burning houses.
Insurance men hotly denied their
responsibility. Then some firemen
donned plain clothes and with their
wives started out to Insure the furni
ture In two vacant houses. The
furniture consisted of a fireman's
helmet and a grand Jury subpoena.
Not a company turned them down,
the firemen said.
Stevens says his men are now se
curing Insurance on a house which
burned to the ground a month ago.

REVELATIONS III
CEXOli AFFAIR
Washington, Jan. 19. Mexico, Its
Intrigues and assassinations, engross
ed the attention of the White House,
state department and congress today.
The promised Mexican revelations
from the state department bade fair
to stir the senate, for its principle
feature is a list of Americans killed
or wounded south ot the Rio Grande
since Diaz was overthrown.
The state department was ready
to present the message to President
Wilson for his approval before sub
mitting it to the senate, in keeping
with Senator Fall's resolution asking
tor all information on Mexican af
fairs possessed by the administration.
The senate foreign committee, how
ever, hoped to examine the docu
ments before they went before the
whole body.
A stormy secret session of the com
mittee seemed likely.
Not only was a majority of the
committee against reporting favor
ably any intervention resolutions be
fore It, but also Senator Borah, re
publican, was so impressed by the
strength of the administration posi
tion that he would not force any
Mexican discussion on the floor un
til he Is reinforced.
Due to the act that President Wil
son's report concerning his negotia
tions with Mexican leaders had not
Ibeen received, the committee decided
to postpone action on the nomination
of Henry P. Fletcher as ambassador
to Mexico, the house foreign com
mittee postponed Indefinitely action
on the Dyer and Moss Mexican re
solutions with their antl-admlnlstra-tlon
complexion.
Congressman Treadway created a
stir on the floor by reading a letter
anent Vlllista atrocities, received
fyorn an American refugee, saying,
among other things:
"Daughters of respectable families
were taken from their homes and
passed from soldier to soldier."

Admiral Fletcher aa to the activities

OF YUAN SHI KAI
(By United Press Leased Wire.)
Pekin, Jan. 19. Numerous arrests
were made today In a plot to blow up
Emperor Tuan Shi Kai. Explosives
had been found In the palace.
The plot, undoubtedly that of re
volutionary agents, followed several
weeks of revolutionary activity. A
few provinces have been active In
the overthrow ot the empire program,
and a few battles of comparatively
minor importance have been fought
Meantime, however, agents have been
busy fomenting dissatisfaction
against Tuan, both In China and In
thla country. Yunnan province Is
the chief Btronghold ot the revolu
tionaries, and against this Yuan has
been directing his chief military
efforts. i
San Francisco, Jan. 19. San Fran
cisco Chinese were inclined today to
attribute the plot against Yuan's life
to revolutionary adherents. The re
bellion against the empire, they
clatm, has been growing gradually l
and they believe that the revolution
ists sought by dynamite to accom
plish quickly their plans tor over
throw ot the new government and
the re-establlshment ot the old re
public. ; ": ! ... ;'
