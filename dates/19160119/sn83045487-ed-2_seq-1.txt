f t
Buck Ordinance Up Would Take Police Force Away
.From Employers' Ass'n Capitalist Attorney Says
Healey's Cops Are Not Neutral and Can't Be.
Charges during garment and car
strikes that Chief Healey runs his
police force first of all for capitalists
and employers and last of all for
strikers and workmen, seeking high
er wages and better shop conditions,
had light thrown on them yesterday.
Dudley Taylor, attorney for the
Employers' ass'n, spoke more than
an hour before council police com
mittee. Taylor is head talker before
legislative bodies whenever Illinois
Manufacturers' ass'n wants a bill or
ordinance killed. He said the whole
ordinance of Aid. Buck, asking for a
new ways of handling strikes, ought
to be killed.
"It is clear that Mr. Taylor wishes
to have present police methods in
strikes continue," was Buck's com
ment "It is also clear Chief Healey
operates his police force in strike
times in the exact manner that Dud
ley Taylor, and the employers who
pay Taylor's salary, want a police
force operated."
All policemen on strike duty must
wear stars, says the Buck ordinance.
