iLUES' WAR CODICIL MEETS IN
LOUDON TO DISCUSS GREECE, NOW
FACMG AN ARMED REVOLUTION
LONDON, Jan. l f >.—When the war council of the
allies unexpectedly met today, the air was full of rumors
of important developments in the Balkans.
Before the session, an official statement discredited
th«<**rn»nn feport that the allies had sent an ultimatum
Ito Greece demanding immediate withdrawal of the
diplomats of the central powers.
The announcement said tlie report "was believed to tie
!untrue "
At the name time. rej»ort« from Rotterdam and from!
(jerman cities *aid a revolutionary movement is afoot jr.
Greece to establish a republic.
\ccording to the stories former Premier Vcnijtelo* would
head the new regime. King C'onstantine is said to be in
danger of being shorn of hi* power at an early moment.
1-rom several sources came reports, too. of various land-
I in"l allied force* in (.recce, together with stories indi
cating the possibility thai the attack of the central powers
| on Salonika is about to begin.
I lie war council was summoned suddenly. The fir«t in-i
| timation th.it it had been called came with the arrival of
Premier firiand of 1-rance.
The Athens censor has parsed hardly any dispatcher for
three days.
This fait is regarded ominous here, in view of reports
of a possible revolution headed by former Premier Yenizelos,
coupled with a doubt that Constantine could control the Greek
artny in a crisis.
It had been reported recently that the Yenizelos party
might refuse to accept the results of the recent election, in
I which they did not participate, thus precipitating a crisis
i when parliament meets Monday.
