COUNTY ATTORNEY SAYS ALL RE
PORTS THAT LAWLESSNESS
PREVAILED AT RAGTOWN DUR
ING FIRE WERE OVERDRAWN.
County Attorney Hardy who upent
the most of two days at Ragtown dur
ing the recent fire, stated yesterday
a'lermiou that the situation had been
vastly overdrawn with reference to
lawlessness said to prevail there dur
ing the conflagration, and for tho
most part the officers had the situation
well in hand, and tho talk of calling
for the state militia was all nonsense
as there was no need of the soldiers,
ami that .Sheriff Garrett and his men
T
had the situation well in hand. "It is
true that there was a killing there
while tho lire raged, but the man
killed was one of the class that Is al
ways looking for trouble, and this
might have occurred at any other time
than when it did. I think the officers ,
did remarkably well in handling tills '
situation and I see no reason for ulj
the exaggerated reports that have
gone forth relative to tho Kagtown'
situation," said the county attorney in
conclusion.
THE BANQUET COMMITTEE
CANNOT BE 3LUFFED
It is "catching before banging" with'
the banquet committee and their plans
go merrily on. Tickets for th t-vent
are selling fast.
Threats of injunction proceeding
against the gridiro.i committee ut tho
Business Men's Banquet which M U
bo held next Monday night at the
Klks' hall failed to have even tho
slightest effect on the member.! of
that committee.
The gridiron has been buili, ami is
ready to he installed, ard ho "fiul"
If being placed In position' so that
when the fires are lit Mon.lay night
there will be plenty of "heat" and
plenty of material to "ro-ist."
Chairman Raines of the ticket com
mittee has been at work for the past
two days, and reports that tho pl.it
are being taken "like hot cakes" nnd,
as fhe number is necessarily limited,
reservations must be made at once.
There will be only one humlre.l
plates, with the utmost limit at oiui
hundred and twenty. From Mr.
(tallies' report, the attendance will
be alxmt equally divided, as the la
dles are just as anxious to see the
men "roasted" nnd "toasted" as the
men are to see what is in store for
themselves or the other fellow.
An elaborate program is being pre
pared and will be a strong feature of
the gridiron, if thp plans of the ar
rangement committee do not fall.
Chairman Velie Suggs of this com
mittee is blaming the gridiron com
mittee for saddling1 a wife on Dave
I anbe, who was appointed chairman
of the reception committee. It is
barely possible that the said gridiron
committee expect to furnish the prom
inent Ardmore bachelor with a wife
that night. If so, they maintain
strict secrecy about their plans, but
from the reporter's standpoint, it
looks "very suspicious."
Mr. Strauchon who is to be the
caterer for the occasion, is taking
great pains and interest in seeing
that his part of the evening's enter
tainment shall be In keeping with the
occasion.
