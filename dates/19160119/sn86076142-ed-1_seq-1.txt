wSlTj.irr9.-Th. Politiken. of Copenhagen, as quoted in
a dispatch, says that anxiety has been aroused in Stockholm my
a speech at the opening of the Swedish parliament by King Gus
tave who urged vigorous preparation of national defense in view of
the disregard on we part of the belligerents of neutral rights.

of provisions from the Swedish-American steamship Stockholm,
bound from New York for Stockholm. The British authorities are
crltlzod by the press, some saying that such actions are worse than

The Sentence of Editor Booth
(Editorial in Reno Evening Gazette)

LONDON. Jan. 19. After the cab
Inet ministers made an earnest appeal
to the trade union congress to defer
demands for Increased wages until
after the war on the ground of nation
al economy, the suggestion came from
the unions that the ministers them-
lva tniirht set an example In
economy by giving up part of their
salaries, which in some offices are
princely. It was indicated in parlia
ment that such a movement was con
templated by the ministers. But now
a leading liberal paper makes an In
gnnious defense of the old scale ol
salaries.
it is an old saying," this paper
argues, "that a minister who gives nis
whole attention to the nation's affairs
has little time for his own, and in the
case of some cabinet ministers a sud
den drop of a third to a half of their
Incomes would create private financial
problems, and therefore some distrac
tion of mind. Ministers are supposed
to be of importance to the nation's
business, and distraction of mind Is
therefore a thing to be avoided. It
Is not at all unlikely this considera
tion may prevail.

Hunt h of the Tononnh Bonanza by Judge J. Emmett
Wulsh of Esmeralda county, sitting for Judge Averill, appears
from the facts as they have been received at Reno to have

district attorney complained Mia Deen a acineraie noei, even
then iii the nmnion of most NevauariR. a sentence ot a day
or so in jail would have complied with all the requirements
of the occasion. Hut those who read the impartial report of

Bonanza and certainly not likely to alter its report to tavor
Editor Booth, are very far from believing that the jury was
correct in finding that the use of the headline "urease mi
Kails. Says the Super," was a gross misdemeanor.

cular one to which Sanders took exception; the idea the paper
Kniio-ht tn i-onvev was that the county commissioners of Nye

were subject to the influence of the district attorney and that,
when he advised them to do a thing, they did it. uutsiae or
Tiuioruili the exnrpsnion is .sued as a synonym of "Let her

slide," and the Tonopah jury, the complaining witness and the
flnblficl.l indire will find it hard to make railway men or any
body else give to it any other meaning. No dictionary and no
person who ever used the expression, so far as the Gazette is
aware, ever gave it an approbrious signification, such as it
u-ns nuui-rtoil to nossesH bv the Drosecution at Tonopah.
Col. Booth cannot be denied a stay of execution pending
d we have no doubt, whatever, that, on appeal,
the supreme court, removed as it is from neighborhood ani
nwwiiieii th.it unfortunately exist some times in communities
and which cannot help influencing to some extent the most im
partial of local tribunals, will set this matter right. In the
meantime, to show how the verdict and sentence have affected
tha p..st df the state, if V. W. Booth were a candidate for any
state office tomorrow before the people, his majority would
be overwhelming. '

the violation of the political truce by

defeat was early forseen, did not fight
so much as champion of the open
saloon as for the liberties which he
claimed went with the open saloon.
Liberty, freedom, self-respect, self
reliance and the right of the social
habits ot the people to live were his
catchwords. Even the beer and dis
tilling trade was not responsible for
Knight's candidacy. It did not even
endorse him. Knight himself had the
name of being a sincere and a rather
simple hearted man, with a good re
cord for usefulness in public life.
