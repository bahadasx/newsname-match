been given in Edgefield in a lon er

anio ne features. The blue bird,
typifying happiness, predominated
in the decoration's. The spacious

blue bird upon which was written
appropriate greetings.

"UNCLE" IV WRITES. .
New Year Reflections. Found
Double of W. Pat Park,
Family Scattered.Fertili
zer Problem.
Dear Old Advertiser:- All my
family are off on a visit to-day ex
cept myself and one of my boys and
? will spend a while chatting with
you.
Sometimes I like to be alone yet
I know that I am not alone for
there is an unseen being near ns, it
doesn't matter where we are.
On new year's day my mind dwelt]
mostly back on my boyhood days]
and, strange to say, yet true,, there j
seemed to be a face and and even ;
voice of one I loved when a boy at
as long as he lived. He was m
Sunday school teacher before the
war and on the- 1st Sunday of everf';'
uew year (it being regular preao.hin
day at the old Calliham's church'
he being leader of the singin
would sing a song the words of th
first verse being, if my mernot;
serves me right,?
"A year again has passed away
Time swiftly speeds along
We come again to praise and pray
And bing our greeting song. ,
We come withjsong to greet yoajj
We oome, we come with song
again."
These may not be the exact words
but still I seemed to hear again that
deep clear voice of B. M. Talbert
and, knowing him as I did, another
thought came: Where is he singing
now, and what is his song?
The next day being Sunday and |
I went to the Sunday school and in
a conversation with a preacher I
told him of the thoughts that b
been running through my mind, an
his reply was, "Yes, I reme m
that 6ong very well."
And the preacher, who is pas
of the church we attend, ie enoug
like W. 'Ffl(PPBj^PWMiM^
be ? t#in brother and I told him]
so and he said, "weil, I have met
several Carolinians who know W.
P. Parks and they all say he and I
are very much alik." I then ashed
him if I oouid call him Brother Pat
and be put one hand on my shoul
der, said "yes, if you want to." So I
call him Brother Pat.
I find a good many people down
here that I knew their grandparents
and near relatives, so you see I am
or do not feel like I am entirely
among strangers.
It grieved me to read of J. H.
Allen's wife's death, because for
some reason I can't help feeliug
near to them and it must be because
I loved their father.
"One by one they pass away
And at no very distant day
We shall see them again.
They only sleep they are not
dead
Oh no, they will live again."
Why do I muse thus I don't
know. For the first time in my life
since I have had a family, except
ing a few years, I have been near
enough to all except one (He in
Texas) to visit them all in almost a
day's time but now we are scattered
here and there in Carolina, three in
Emanuel county, Ga.,, two in Co
lumbia co un ly, Ga., five in AJo
Dutfie county. Ga.', and one in. Tex
as and I find myself wondering why
so and the thought comes: I wonder
if God isn't just cutting' loose the
Cords that bind' me to this earth-and
makes me look forward to that day
when it all are God's children we
will he near to each'other again
never to be parted any more. But I
am no preacher and will write of
something else. \
The farmers around in this sec
tion are beginning to turn their
land and on every side the question
is being asked, how can we expect
to make a crop without guano?
Well, we must have something to
put under our corn and cotton, we
might haul the dirt from one part
of the field to another, fill up the
distributor, hitch the mule and put
out the dirt. But, say you, would
that pay? Well, I don't know, but
from what I can learn, it would pay
about as well as hauling dirt from
the factory or depot. And besides I
understand the guano men say they
will not sell except for cash, and
pray tell me how many or what per
cent, of the farmers have the cash
and if they had would it pay to buy
the low grade fertilizers that will
be put on the market. Better plow
more and do without.
We are having summer and win
tev. and Mrs. G. M. Sexton Very
Warmly Welcomed in New
Field. Send Greetings
to Edgefield Friends.
j To eaoh and every one we send
}ry cordial greetings, and we grate
illy rememberevery courtesy shown
while we lived in your midst.
The names and faces of those who
tjood ?o faithfully by u?* in the ser
of the Master's canse are and
ir ?hall be fresh in our memory.
On telling friends good-bye we
lt quite sure that some of them
would never see again, but were
irprised and saddened to receive
ie intelligence, so soon, that one
our dear friendo, a member of
Mum Branch Baptist church, a-no
ie Christian woman, Mrs. M. A.
backwell, bad passed into the sweet
?yond. How we do feel for the
)ved ones, and assure them of our
rayera and sympathy.
We are now living in the county
eat town of Dorchester. St. George
me "snap" and "go" of a little
fly. She bas a splendid electric
system of lighting the town. Also,
3be of the best schools in the State
?r primary and academio work, and
?good school of music, two- strong
banks, a first-class cotton market
and an average good market for al
most any commodity-a very pretty j
ifewn of twelve hundred people.
?:W? count ourselves quite fortu
nate to be able to.cast our lot among
ap noble a people. We are very
pleasantly located, living in a nice,
nw bix-room parsonage, on a shaded
wt joining the church lot, on which
sets a splendid wooden building
which has recently undergone some
repairs in the interior.
The peop'e received us very
courteously, meeting us at the train
ir-a touring car, bearing us away,
-migifV to. the parsonage, where j
w*. were met by some repr?sentative f
men and women of the church. Af
ter- meeting us they left us imme
diately. We discovered, on-going j
into the parsonage, that on the din
ing table was a well prepared sapper
and quite a number of things in the
grocery line for the pantry.
About one week later some of the I
members of the country churches
came bringing, others sending, a
veritable load of good things to eat,
so that for a long time we shall not]
have io visit the groceryman.
Our car was unloaded and furni
ture placed in the parsonage before
our arrival.
One gratifying thing is, that these
people are thoroughly loyal to their
church and denomination, and above
all, noble Christians, possessing, to
a large degree, the spirit of self sac
rifice.
So being already assured of the I
heartiest co-operation and feeling]
divinely led, we, with buoyant hope,
enter upon the work of our new
field.
We solicit the earnest prayers of j
our Christian friends back at "old
home," and give them a hearty in
vitation to visit the "manse" of St.
George, if ever you would like to
come toward the coast.
Mr. and Mrs. G. W. Sexton.

some days (like to-day) you almost
freeze sitting by the fire and other
days it is too warm to wear a coat.
The email grain, both wheat and
oats, is looking well and some who
did not finish before Christmas were
sowing last week. Nearly every
farmer in this section has corn to
sell. My nearest neighbor has 100
bushels for sale and he only worked
a horse and a half farm last year
and still bas some of his-cotton on
hand and I understand some money
in the bank. Everybody works down
here even the old min. .

Batesburg, Jan. 17.-Announce
ment was made here this week of
the engagement of Miss Mamie
Louise Cato of Monetta, S. C., to
Mr. Chester M. Swearingen of
Trenton; S. C., the marriage to take
place in early Spaing. The an
nouncement came as a surprise a?
well as with ^cordial interest to the
many friends of the young couple
throughout the State.
The bride is a popular young
woman possessing rare personal
beauty with a brilliant, sparkling
mind and a fascinating manner that
attracts instantly all who meet her.
She has visited here frequently and
has made many friends, all of
whom will wish her much happi
ness.
Miss Cato is the only daughter
of Mr. and Mrs. John M. Cato, and
Mr. S wean'n gen is the youngest son
of Mr. and Mrs. j. M. Swearingen
i of Trenton, S. C., and is a success
ful and prosperous young man,
well known and highly regarded in
the business world as he is in the
sooial.
The marriage will be one of the
interesting events of the early spring
and will be attended by a number
of good wishes from this place.
First Game of The New Series.
The card club was entertained by
Miss Virginia Addison Saturday af
ternoon, this being he first game
under the new series of games. Miss
Addison's guests were not confined
to the members of the club but
other friends were invited. Six ta
bles wire arranged. At the meeting
of the club Saturday the following
officers were elected: Mrs. Bettie
Cantelou, president; Miss Virginia
Addison, secretary, and jMrs. A. H.
Coriey, treasurer. . The score was
not announced at the close of the
game. A record of each game will,
be kept by the secretary arid when
the series is half. completed the
score will be announced and prizes
presented to the two making the
highest record. Miss Addison's
decorations were pink and white, a
profusion of pot plants and cut
flowers being used in the decoration
of the parlor and large dining table.
At the close of the game the hos
tess invited the guests into the din
ing room and served a hot lunch.
Two Kinds of Farmers.
Why is it that so often farmer's
living side by side on farms of equal
size and fertility get such different
results? Evidently the reason must
be found mostly in the men them
selves. Une man takes in agricul
tural papers, kewps posted on farm
ing, plans for the future, keeps his
land in fine conditiou and farms
scientifically. Another man neg
lects these things, loafs about in
town instead of attending to his
work, and fails in good repair. One
man linds farming pays and is bap
pyi the other says there is no
money in farming and is in a chron
ic state of discouragement.-Or
angeburg Times.
Take Care of Ewes.
The winter care of the flock is
important to insure a lamb crop to
be harvested in* the spring. Ewes
m good condition need not be fed
grain until about a month before
lambing, when they should gradu
ally be accustomed to it. Ewes ic
thin or poor condition should re
ceive from one-fourth to one-half
pound of grain daily. Corn alone
is not the best grain ration. A ra
tion of 6 parts corn, 3 parts wheal
bran, and 1 part linseed oil cake,
by weight, has proven vtry satis
factory. A ration of corn, oats,
and bran, equal paris by weight,
Can also be recommended.
The sheep should receive as much
clover or alfalfa hay as they will
eat. The am out of hay eaten oap
be cut down by the use of corn
silage or corn stover. Two pounds
clean, sweet corn silage eau be used
to replace about one pound of hay.
Well cured corn stover is also rel
ished by the ewes. Ordinarily,
there is little danger of the sheep
eating too much of it, if the hay is
ted once a day. The greatest dan
ger of corn stover comes from mak
ing it the exclusive feed. Clean
salt and water should be kept be
fore the flock. Sheep should al
ways have a dry, well bedded floor
to lie on.-Ohio State Bulletiu.
