ADDRESSED COLLEGE CLUB
Judge W. P. Smith Told of Work of
The Juvenile Courts.
The College club held an open meet
ing at the Museum class room Satur
day afternoon, having quite a number
of ladies and gentlemen as their
guests. The president of the club
gracefully introduced Judge Walter P.
Smith as the speaker of the day who
followed 'with a carefully prepared
and most informing paper on juvenile
courts. Judge Smith traced the
growth and development of the juve
nile court movement in this country,
saying that the United States had the
honor of leading in this notable re
form. He also devoted considerable
attention to the"Vermont law, which
has now been in successful operation
for two and .one-half years. He
strongly urged the establishment of
detention homes, as provided for the
juvenile court system in many states,
and also suggested that a wider juris
diction might be given so that parents
could be reached as well as delin
quent children. Following the ad
dress there was a brief discussion of
a subject which greatly interested all
present.

PREPAREDNESS.
Will Be Discussed Before Commer
cial Club By Colonel Reeves
And General Tillotson.
On Thursday evening, Jan. 27, the
Commercial club and the local .com
pany of State Militia will act as joint
hosts to Colonel Ira L. Reeves, presi
dent of Norwich university, and Adjutant-General
Lee S. Tillotson of the
Vermont National Guard.
The Commercial club has decided
to hold its January meeting with the
local company on the subject of na
tional preparedness. The two speak
ers, Colonel Ira L. Reeves and Adj.
General Lee S. Tillotson, will devote
most of their time showing why the
Vermont National Guard should be
raised to a high standard of efficiency.
They will outline how the Commercial
club as an organization, and the mem
bers as individuals, can help toward (
this end. , "
This meeting promises to be an es
pecially interesting one and every
member should attend, in order to i
show his interest; not only in the
club, but in the local company of the
Vermont National Guard. At this
meeting the text-book committee will
also make their report. An outline of
the book will appear in the next issue.
The great difficulty in the success of
the militia of the State is to keep the
men in its ranks, which may be partly !
due to the lack in its personnel, but
which is largely accounted fot by the
fact that the employers are not will-'
ing in many instances to allow the
members of the militia their time off
to attend the State camp, which duty
they must perform if they are to
serve. Some employers are willing to
give the men the time to go to the
camp if they will use that time as
their vacation, which is not always
what the young men desire to do with
their vacations.
The Industrial Education committee
of the Commercial club is the third
one to commence active work. They
held their first meeting last Wednes
day and discussed the various plans
of vocational education.
"They finally decided to investigate
these plans further in order to better
determine which would be the best for
St. Johnsbury. When this plan has
been decided on and the various de
tails worked out the Commercial club
will present the plan to the people of
St. Johnsbury for their approval.
So far the Commercial club has
three committees actively engaged
and will attempt to start the charter
committee some time this week. The
members of the various committees
have taken a deep interest in their
work and it is safe to say that the
Commercial club will have started
work which will be of lasting service
to the community.
A fine example of tha value of
pure bred cattle was givn at Dr. J.
M. Allen's farm, Creslmont, a few
days ago. A grade . Holstein cow
dropped a heifer calf which was sold
for f 250. About the same time a reg
istered Holstein cow dropped a heifer
calf and the doctor was offered $150
for it when it was 18 hours old. He
kept the calf and it wil be grown to
become a member of the doctor's fine
herd of 30 registered Holsteins he is
keeping on his farm.

E3ow Do You Like Ot?
Some folks consider an Insurance Agent a nuisance. They allow
if they want any Insurance, they can go after it, but they seldom do this.
I write all kinds of Insurance and am glad to do it, but I do not
personally solicit business from any one. Should be glad to bave you
call at my office, where I can show you more intelligently, just what
I can do for you, or will call on you upon request, either by Phone,
374-1, or by card. I claim to have the very best of all kinds an

until very recently, of business In gen
eral, the people of St. Johnsbury and
vicinity have kept up their habits of
thrift, for the bank's deposits have
increased very materially In the past
year.
In addition to paying 4 to deposit
ors in 1915, the surplus and undivided
profits, which In a mutual savings
bank as this is, are the property of the
depositors, have been increased and
are an element of strength to the
bank. Altogether the year past has
been a very profitable one for the
bank. At this time Judge Smith read
a very fitting testimonial to the mem
ory of Theron M. Howard.
