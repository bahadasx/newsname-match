That a brutal murder was commit
ted, with robbery as the motive, is
the conviction of authorities at the
military post a conviction strength
ened by the finding in a nearby bath
house of a heavy fire poker, smeared,
with grease and dirt, to which a num
ber of human hairs are adhered.
George, who had been for many
years in the employ of the quarter
master's department, was a small,

of last night obliterated any traces
which George's assailant might have
left on the soft ground nearby.
Vaugban to Investigate.
U. S. District Attorney Horace W
Vaughan has begun an investigation
into the death of George.
The sheriffs office, claiming it has
no jurisdiction as the affair occurred
on a military .reservation, turned the
case over to the district attorney's of
fice. Mr. Vaughan was to get in touch
with the judge advocate general's of
fice and other military authorities to
ascertain the . cause of the man's
death. '
"If there Is evidence of murder." Mr.
Vaughan says, "the federal officials
will take charge of the case. If the
evidence points to manslaughter only.
the military authorities will be asked
to take charge."
Deputy Sheriff Plemer of Waialua

mains today, it was reported.

Wailele Could Find No Trace of
Distressed Bark Columbine,
or Navajo ; ;
At I o'clock this afternoon no fur
ther word had been received from the
U. S.. lightship tender; Columbine ex-
peeled this morning: '. '.'"., "
Late last night the Fort De Russy
radio station, working for the naval
station, was in touch with the Colum
bine about 10:30. "All well. Will be
in Honolulu in morning," was the mes
sage caught distinctly. Then came the
words, -Hawser . . . Navajo," after
which the message ceased.
This is taken by the naval, station
to mean that the Navajo Is towing
the bark British Yeoman to Honolulu.
The bark was towed from danger at
Port Allen by the Columbine, to a
point ll miles south of Nawfliwili.
The Columbine yesterday reported the
Yeoman's rudder disabled, her anch
ors gone and the bark to be leaking
badly. '
It is believed the U. S. navy tug
Navajo is towing the British Yeoman,
and that the tender Thetis is standing
by. Both vessels left here yesterday
morning to assist the Columbine and
the bark. ' I
Vain Voyage for Wailele.
. Unable to find any trace of the
bark British Yeoman or. the U. S.
lighthouse tender Columbine, the In-
ter-Island steamer Wailele returned j
to Honolulu at 9 o'clock this morning, I
reporting mat sne naa not Been me
bark from the moment she. left here
Monday afternoon until she returned
to port
The Wailele had about as much luck
as the proverbial person who seeks
for a needle in a haystack. To the
thick weather, which made it Impos
sible to see much more than 500 feet
from the steamer even during day
light yesterday, the Wailele officers
ascribe her inability to locate the
bark.
Steaming w ith all the speed she pos
sessed to Port Allen, the W allele s
master. Capt. Louis Self, and Joseph
E. Sheedy, general superintendent of
the Inter-Island, found when they ar
rived at the Kauai port that the Brit
ish Yeoman was no longer there.
Steamed to Nawiliwili. :
As it was not possible to land a
boat at Port Allen because of he rag'-
ing seas there, the Inter-Island off!
cials headed the Wailele for Nawili
wili. There they found all the tele
phone lines down because of the
storm.
Hiring an auto they managed to get
to Port Allen, where they found the
Columbine had towed the British Yeo
man out to sea. They returned to
Nawiliwili and there they found a ra
dio message from the Columbine wait
ing for them, stating that the light
house tender and the Yeoman i were
riding out the storm 15 miles south of
"Nawiliwili and could be found there.
All speed was made to the position
Indicated by the Columbine, but no
trace could be found of either ship.
The Wailele cruised around in a wide
radius, passing most of yesterday aft
ernoon searenmg ior tne two vessels.
The : thick weather, however, prevent
ed the steamer from catching even a
glimpse, so the Inter-Island boat came
back to Honolulu this morning, "out
of luck, having never even seen the
British Yeomaa. much less got a line
to her. The Wailele has no radio
plant so could not get in touch with
the Columbine.

QUESTIONS STATEMENTS
OF ENGINEER AND MAYOR
"How Long Would Any Busi
ness Last" Under Such Con
ditions, He Asks
From a Honolulu businessman who
has been studying the question of mu
nicipal expenditures the Star-Bulletin
has received the following critical dis
cussion of the city's expenses, with
particular reference to the recent re
port of the grand jury:
"His Honor the Mayor and the for
mer road engineer having taken excep
tion to a recent report of the grand
Jury. n so' far as it relates to the
conduct of the road department, it
seems that the topic is open for dis
cussion. The mayor simply says the
report Is untrue, which leaves no room
for . argument, so far as he is con
cerned. We must simply take his
word for it and let it go at that. We
must however,, agree with the mayor
In one respect' A certain four miles
of good road (out of the 8-j miles in
question) was not mentioned snecific
ally in the grand jury report This is
very reprehensible. ' The grand Jury
should have made that particular four
miles of road the subject of their re
port The city and county adminis
tration would have been pleased and
the . public happy in the knowledge
that i here was an excellent road
around four miles of . the island of
Oahu. '
"The former road engineer has
pointed out certain points of the re
port In which the jury erred. 'jQne of
these is the' item of $3720 expended
for equipment. in the month of May.
Thjs, it wxuld seem, is quite prverly
piacea in me overneaa expense. While
It is true that the money was spnt
for new equipment it was only to re

GROWTH CAUSE OE
LARGER STAFF AT
Bank Now Has Three Assistant
Cashiers; Cecil Brown Re
tires From Directorate
Two changes have been made at
the First National Bank of Hawaii,
the retirement from the board of di
rectors of Cecil Brown, -one of the
bank's founders, and the enlargement
of the staff of . officers of the bank
by the naming of a third assistant
cashier, the latter step being necessi
tated by the growth of the bank's bus
iness. Shareholders held their annual
meeting on Tuesday of last week and
elected the ' following directors:
George N. Wilcox, George P. Castle, L.
Tenney Peck, H. M. von Holt, James
L. McLean and Rudolf Buchly.
On Monday of this week the direct
ors held their organization meeting
and elected the following officers:
Mr. Peck. ' president,' Mr. von Holt,
vice-president; Mr. Buchly, cashier,
and W. H. Campbell. C. A. Stobie and
J. H. Ellis, assistant cashiers.
The retirement of Mr. Brown from
the board of directors and from his
position as chairman of the board was
made because of his continued ill
health, and the prospects of his being
unable to resume active responsibili
ties and business cares.
Mr. Ellis, the new assistant cashier,
has been with the bank since his ar
rival in Hawaii in May, 1910. prior to
which time he was an officer in a
bank in one of Chicago's suburbs.

THINKS BOMBARDMENTS
IN EUROPE CAUSE OF
BIG RAINS IN HAWAII
The terrific bombardments and
cannonading in Europe have com
pletely changed the globe's upoer,
air currents, which accounts for
the unusual storms which have
been sweeping over Hawaii and
X the mainland for the last few
weeks.
This is the belief of Capt. E.
H. Parker, port officer for the
Kahului (Maui) railroad, accord
ing to a story brought to Hono
lulu by Marshal J. J. Smiddy.
Capt Parker, says the marshal,
is pretty sure that his theory is
correct: in fact, he is so sure of
it that he intends to submit it to

FOR DIG LEAKAGE
Loss of Water From No. 4 Due
to Leak in Main Pipe, Say
Sedgvvlek and Larrison
LONG-FAMOUSTROUBLE
CAN NOW BE REMEDIED
Bad Pipes Can Be Repaired
and Rainfall Conserved in
Dry Weather
That the supposed seepage in Nuu
anu reservoir No. 4 is really a leak
in the main pipe which leads out of
the reservoir, conveying water down
to the city electric light plant, and
from the sluice pipe also, has recent
ly been proved by two water experts,
Thomas F Sedgwick and George K.
Larrison.
Methods employed by the two men
to ascertain the . cause of ws'er loe
fiom the reservoir consisted mainly
in shutting off the water from the
mam pipe, a suggestion made Dy Air.
Sedgwick, thus .reducing the outflow
from two -springs below the dam.
Three springs exist below the dam,
two of which are beyond question di
rectly influenced by the flow in the
main pipe,' and a third cne which
seems to gather its water from a
swamp mauka of the main pipe and
not connected with the pipe leak in
any manner..
Mr. Larrison now believes that the
actual seepage : from the reservoir
through the dam structure amounts to
practically nothing. He suggests that
the reservoir should be emptied and
the bad pipes repaired as 'soqn as
possible to still get value from the
wet season's rains. , ; V
Two Pipes Drain Water.
Two parallel j)es, )ead out of .the
reservoir, one-'golog dowji to the "elec
tric light plant and the other a much
shorter pipe serving merely as a
sluice pipe for cleaning out the reser
voir at intervals. The sluice pipe
opens at a valve some distance below
the dam. ' ' '.

Robert W. Maloney, Troop M,

ming in Spite of Warning
Clad in a bathing suit which he put
on in the batnnouse or Memies iav
ern, the body of Robert W. Maloney,
troop M, 4th Cavalry, was found this
morning by Robert Arcia and Sam Le
leiwi on the beach in front of the Mo-
ana hotel. Maloney was drowned yes
terday morning while swimming at
Waikiki Beach : and as he is said to
be a good swimmer it is supposed he
must have been attacked by cramps
while in the water.
Today Deputy Sheriff Julius W.
Asch notified the soldier's father, J. J.
Maloney, 105 Vanderbilt avenue,
Brooklyn, N. Y.4 of the death of oh
son.- .
Maloney was a farrier with the 4th
Cavalry and was 29 years of age. He
enlisted in Colorado and was serving
his second enlistment :
After renting a bathing suit at
Heinie's Tavern yesterday morning
Maloney went swimming, and it was
first thouglit he might have been
drowned wnen the Japanese attendant
discovered late in the afternoon that
his clothes weie still in his locker.
Put on Suit Erly.
This was about 4 in the afternoon
and as Maloney went in the water, oi
at least put on the suit about V:30
yesterday morning, it was thought
strange hevdid not return, and alter
a brief investigation the disappear
ance of the man was reported to the
police.
When he rented the suit yesterday
Maloney was in good spirits and was
laughing and joking with the attend
ant in the bathhouse. Before he went
in he was told the sea was very rough
and dangerous, but would not heed
advice not to go in the water. .
Maloney had a bank account at the
Bishop & Company Branch bank,
Schofield Barracks, and was know
among his comrades as a young man
of excellent character. Today the ad
jutant of his regiment took charge of
the body, which will be sent to the
mainland.
