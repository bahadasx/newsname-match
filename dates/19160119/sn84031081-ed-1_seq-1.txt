the cowardly murder had been com

the sunken German submarine after
the British ship got them in their
power by a "disgraceful and treach

"The tone the British government

Herr Noske said tho German peo

mitted that he and mnny olher per

for he said, It seemed monstrous
that British seamen should have

so as British seamen in other in

"The Germans defend ther action
in the case of the Huel on the ground
that it wus a measure of reprisal In
accordance with measures announced
by the German government in Feb
ruary, 1915. It is claimed that these
reprisals are legitimate, owing to the
action of Great Britain in attempting'
to cut off from Germany nil Imports
and starve tho German people. The
Germans thus maintain their subma
rine policy in consequence, of tho
British measures against Herman
trade.
"This Is, of course, r,ulte untrue,

"Tho Germans maintain that in
the cases of the Arabic, the E-13 and
the Ruel they were only aiming atj
tho destruction of hostile ships and
In no wise the destruction of helpless
persons. The death roll of the Ara
