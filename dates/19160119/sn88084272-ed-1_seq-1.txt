Approach to Central Avenue
Bridge Is Washed Out;
City Is Cut In Two.
AGED MANLOSES
LIFE IN FLOOD
More Water Flowing Over
Roosevelt Dam Than. En
gineers Contemplated.
PHOENIX. ARIZ," Jan. 19. Phoenix
and Teznpe are In danger of Inun
dation by the biggest flc-cd in the
history of the Salt Elver valley. Old
umers say the great Hood of 1S91 is
surpassed by the present rush of
waters down Salt river, -which is ex
pected to reach Its crest this afternoon.
Phoenix is threatened' from two
directions. The reclamation service
ras men and teams repairing the
levee four miles southeast of the city
to prevent the Salt river breaking- into
the Grand canal and sending-. a flood
ever the southern and eastern parts of
the city. Another reclamation force
spent the night -working on a levee
nine miles northwest of here to pre
vent the waters of Cave creek sweep-
ins over me norm ana west sections
of the capital cRy.
However, the creek broke through
the Arizonascaina. iMK tatternoon and
some water -cot into the west part of
the city. Several hundred acres north,
surrounding the handsome country
lub were Inundated. The creek was
subsiding this afternoon and no real
danger was feared from that source.
City Seems AVell Protected.
There is absolutely no panic and lit
tle apprehension. The population is
confident that no Coods or any con
sequence wijl reach the city. It Is
recognized however, that adobe build
ings in the Mexican quarter may melt
ard go.
Still another levee prevents the Salt
siver sweeping south of Tempo butte
and through town. This levee is in
perfect condition and unless the water
goes much higher than is expected,
Tt-rope will not suffer.
The storm is over and the sun is
sfinmg orlgnuy. The snows in the
mountains are still melting and no one
can say with certainty when its floods
will end. ,
Bridge Approach "Washed Out.
A number of men and teams worked
all night building up the south ap
proach to Central avenue bridge, a mile
south of Phoenix to prevent communi
cation between the two sides of the
river being cut. It was alitor naught
as the river rose two feet and a half
in the night and this morning a
swirling stream flowed over the
approach.
A channel 200 feet wide was blasted
south of the bridge today in an at
tempt to save the structure. The water
is within three feet of the beams. An
army of men is clearing away the de
bris lodging above.
One Ufe Is Lost.
One life is believed to have been
lost. The cabin of John Hicks, the old
man caretaker of a swimming resort
southwest of Phoenix, was washed
away and Hicks cannot be located.
Officers were this morning notified
that a woman with a new born baby
and her nurse were marooned on an
isiana southeast or the city.
A family of 14. marooned on an Is
land southeast or Phoenix, was rescued
bv officers in boats. Twelve of the
members collected were singing "Near
er My God to Thee." Two boys were
chasing Jack rabbits for food.
Dancer at Roosevelt Dam.
Roosevelt reservoir became full at i
o'clock yesterday afternoon. This
afternoon 12 feet-of water was flowing
over the spillways. If it rises much
more It will flood over the dam. The
designers of the dam never expected
more than five feet to pass through the
spillways. The telephone line to
Roosevelt went out early todav. The
bridge over Fish creek on the "Roose
velt road is tottering. There has been
no stage service between Globe and
Phoenix for several days and auto
stage lines In the Salt river valley are
operating under great difficulty be
cause of mud and water.
All train and mall schedules are dis
arranged. Ti,1I'Wsf Mn?: Be " Away.
The reclamation service predicted at
neon that this afternoon the Salt river
would be carrying twice as much water
as at present. The gage below Phoenix
stood at 11 feet at noon. The lower
section of the city Is sure to be flooded
If the predicted rise comes and it is
beared that Central avenue bridge,
which cost over $100,000, will go. Al
ready the structure is regarded as un
safe and officers allow no one thereon.
One SO foot span Is five inches out
of place, and the south approach to tho
Tempo bridge is almost gone.
Both approaches to the Florence
Bridge have been washed out.
Power Plants Forced to Close.
The power house at Roosevelt went
cut of commission with grounded bush
bars last night. The water has backed

IlIi PRAISES
HIE REMIT!
Says Problem of Officers Is
Partly Solved By New
High Class of Men.
London, Ens., Jan. 19. Lord Derby,
father of the Derby recruiting scheme,
declaredTuesday that the new recruits
are of the highest order, mostly of me
dium and large stature, and that their
intelligence is of such a high order as
to help solve the problem of officers.
Asked how many men would come
forward under the Derby plan, and what
the British fighting force in the field
would be, he said:
"It is impossible to make estimates
on the numbers of men, for if the
Ansel Gabriel made an estimate, some
one would be found in the house of
commons to rise and challenge the esti
mate. But. one essential thing is sure
it has been a complete answer to
Germany, and has shown that we will
have enough men to carry forward the
war to a successful conclusion."
When lord Derby was asked what
a "successful conclusion" implied he
said: ,
"Answering that might involve lay
ing down terms of peace, such as Ger
many's getting out of Belgium and
France, and -so on, which is outside
my province. But, certain it is. that
a successful conclusion" of the war
means that It will be prosecuted until
we have such a peace as will make it
perfectly sure that there will be no
farther war of this kind in bur time
or in our children's children's time."
Lord Derby has no doubt of the out
come, and he referred to the ability of
the rapidly expanding army, to give
Germany "a good licking," and he add
ed, "it will do it ail right."

Tennant, parliamentary undersecretary

of thugs to kill her husband.
The Introduction by the prosecution
Tuesday of the bloodstained garments

Mohr. on the night he was killed, al
most broke the self-control which his
widow, Mrs. Elizabeth F. Mohr, who Is
accused of instigating two negroes to
murder him. bad exhibited ever since
the trial began. Although she kept her
gaze averted after one hasty glanc at '
the bullet-pierced hat and other cloth
ing, and one of her attorneys attempt
ed to divert her attention by talking
to her while the. various exhibits were
being offered, she constantly wiped
tears from her eyes.
Constable Gives Testimony.
Aside from the introduction of the
exhibit, a feature of tho day's pro
ceedings was the testimony of consta
ble Jones E. Wallace, who quoted Mrs.
Mohr as having told him that D-. Mohr
was a dangerous man and that if some
people had gone through what she had
gone through, they would have killed
the doctor long ago.
Constable Wallace, on cross-examination,
admitted that Mrs. Mohr told
him that she loved her husband. He
I denied that he told her that the doctor
was a scoundrel ana ought to be snot,
and that she knew "two men around
Harrington who "had It In for the doctor

defence. It read In part:
"My son Charles has told me that
his father has taken them three times
to call on Miss Burger. I am going to
get after her. She is not going to get
the best of me. I will kill her before
I'm through with the whole matter.
She is a low person when sho won't
listen to a good woman like me., who
asks her to stay away frCm my hus
band. She will be sorry before many
days.
"I Just want to let you know your
slsterlplaw is deceiving you. Tm not
going to put up with it Please look
into this matter and don't let her Jolly
you. I give her fair warning."
Seemed littler Toward Husband.
Rooks told of conversations he had
with Mrs. Mohr between December,
1913, and June, 1914, and said she had
expressed herself as very bitter toward
her husband.
"She said she could hire a couple of
thugs to murder her husband." he said.
"She also said she hoped he would
get killed by his automobile."
Offered Divorce for Money.
In response to question by the prose
cution the witness stated Mrs. Mohr
had said Miss Burger would never irve
to marry her husband, that she would
kill her first Sho said Mrs. Mohr had
said she would give her husband a dl
lorce if he would give her $30,900 and
the" Middletown estate. He said he
went to see Arthur Cushing. one of
Mrs. Moor's attorneys, about the
threats.
On cross examination the witness
denied that he bad told Mrs. Mohr in
1912 he could control Miss Burger.

that he had told her Dr. Mohr was a
scoundrel and he would like to "put a
couple of bullets into him."
