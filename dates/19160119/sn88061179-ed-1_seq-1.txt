Estimated Production In 1915

Geological Survey Re?
ports Better Out?
look for Coal In
sustry.
The coal industry of the Uni?
ted States; which began the
year lOifi kinder kid verso con?
ditions, improved Bteadly dur?
ing the Hummer und fall in
sympathy with tho general bet
torment of business, nnd in
November an.! December was
in better position us regards
markets and prices than at tiny
time since liii:'., although in
'the territory west of Ohio the
improvement came too late tu
overbalance the depression of
the earlier months.
The production of bituminous
coal ami anth< icit'e in tlte Unit?
ed States in I'Ab is estimated
by C. K. Lesiter, ol the United
Slates Geological Survey, tit
518,000,000 short tons, an in?
crease over 101-1 of less than I
per c?nt. Bituminous produce
tion increasetl about u,r>U0jOOO
tons, and the output of anthra
cite was less than in IU1-I by
about 2,200,000 sin.it tons.
The increase in the output uf
soft coiil was not situ red equally
by all the fields, for reports
from too coal-carry in? railroads
and from leading coal-mining
operators ami others familiar
with the industry indicate that
in the bituminous (iuhis 61 the
Mast production increased,
whereas in the a run west of
Ohio there wus a general de?
crease. All Stales in tin- .Mis?
sissippi Valley and in the Rocky
Mountain and I'acilie roast
regions, except Colorado and
possibly Wyoihiug, remained
cither practically stationary as
regards output or showed de?
creases.
Ill tile Kasl, nn tu eon lit of
the steady demand for export
coal and for coke for steel mak?
ing and the general improve?
ment in business, the nut nut of
bituminous coal in i'eitMriytva
ilia, West V irginia, Is. ;., \.
and Alabama increased tu a
gratifying extent. Oliib and
Virginia, also bail increases,
but Georgia, Maryland, and
Tennessee recorded decreases.
In Pennsylvania the increase
was mainly in tin- coking dis?
tricts, and for the State it is
estimated to have been about
6,000,000 tons. The weekly re?
ports of coke production pub
lis.'ict) in the Couuellsvillo
Courier indicate that tin- out?
put of coke in tile two t.'ou
nollsville districts increased
over 2,000,;000 Ions, or Hi per
cent, and as each ton of coke
represents about \l- tons of coal,
ail increase of over !}.t)00,t>00
tons uf coal is indicated. The
prosperous condition of the
sieei industry in the South ir,
responsible for an increase of
nearly 1,000.000 tons in the eual
output of Alabama. Develop?
ments begun several years ago
in West Virginia and in east?
ern Kentucky are now going at
full capacity, and not a small
part of the demand lor Ken?
tucky coal comes from the byT
product coke plants of the Mid?
dle West. This increase in Ken?
tucky was about '2,000,000 tons,
and in Wi st Virginia approxi?
mately l ,500,000 short tons.
It is not unreasonable 10 con?
sider that the increase in the
Kust would have been much
?realer had it not been for a
shortage o f transportation
facilities, which developed in
I 1
the fall und which at the close
uf the year assumed serious
propertiouB. The shortage of
railroad ears was confined main?
ly to the Kast and South and is
said to be due to the congestion
at seaboard points caused by
the inability of skippers to ac?
quire ocean'going vessels to
take care uf the great quantities
of foreign freighl forwarded
from the interior. The rise in
ocean freight rates caused
or: ly vetio ,! l tiormally engaged
in coal transportation to be
transferred to grain and other
highorpriced commodities, and
ibis lias resulted in a decrease
since August and September in
the quantity of coal exported
to Kuropc and .South America.
Notwithstanding those difllcul
ties, the quantity of coal ex?
ported to Gurope and South
America during the llrsi I"
months of l'.ilS exceeded the
quantity exported in the same
period of 101-1 by about 3,000,
000 tous; In 1015, lipwovor, ex?
ports 6f both anthracite and
bituminous coal to Canada de.
creased.
The markets for coal from
the Mississippi Valley wore
more restricted in 1016 than for
several years past. The rail?
roads, tin1 largest users uf coal
in that territory, are reported
to have economized in their use
of e ml by decreasing tin- nutu?
ber of trains and >>y tin- intro?
duction <>f more efficient me
limits of tiring locomotives.
The decrease in tin- output of
coal in Illinois, Indiana and
lowti was close to I per cent,
and in the South Weslarn Slates,
Arkansas, Kansas,M issoitri and
Oklahoma, the decrease was
over to per cent. Largely be?
cause of the successful competi?
tion of natural gas ami petroU
emu, t lie out pul of coal in Texas
decreased in 1016 as compared
with It'll.
Increased use of fuel oil and
ui hydroelectric power, the un?
settled condition of mining and
smelling in Mexico, and the
competition of Canadian coal
liuve tended to restrict the mar?
ket fot coal in the far VVesi,
and to tliOSO factors the general
decrease in output in that re?
gion is attributed. Coal pro?
duction increased in Colorado
from :i to ? per cent but de?
creased in Montana, Ne.v Mex
teo and Utah. North Dakota
4iud Wyoming receded but lit
tie chang. < hi the Pacific coast
Washington decreased about 'J'J
per cent.

PROSPERITY
HERE TO STAY.
Business Boom Not Depend?
ent Upon The War In
Europe.
Now York, Jan. 12.?A care?
ful review of the tuition's busi?
ness and industry has Just
been nitida by representatives
here.
The purpose was to discover
whether there is ground for the
widely published optimism on
returning prosperity ? whether
there is improvement apart
from the influence of war or?
ders.
There seems to be no doubt
that definite, actual prosperity
has arrived, east of the Rocky
Mountains, at least. Herewith
we set down some of the im?
portant facts and straws which
we have secured.
The country's chief metal in?
dustry, Bteoij is booming. The
United Slates Steel Corporation
can keen its rolling mills in full
operation until spring with or?
ders now in hand.
American iron and steel is
now a IO,(HMi,nuo to a-year in?
dustry, and is now at its
capacity.
.Most Wouudorful change has
cuiie in the railroad industry.
All lines are loaded to Capa?
city. This is shown by the ar?
rival of a serious car shortage.
Idle cars on Sept. 1, number?
ed 1*3,.'u?), en Oct. I, 08,299, On
Nov. 1, there were only 20,228
nib-cars and today every an?
cient ear and locomotive is at
work.
Railroad lounge increased lu
per Cent in one week the first
hall' of November.
Railroads in the bands of re?
ceivers, and as bail, are picking
up wonderfully. The Erie,
which has been a joke for
years, is doing tin- heaviest:
business, for its size, east ?l
Chicago. Exports of iron and
steel have increased 1100 per
cent since last January.
The lumber trade was nearly
dead in IiiU und the war killed
it. Now it is rapidly reviving.
Many timber concerns are now
running tu full capacity.
A straw mi business in the
West and Southwest is shown
by tlie hank clearings of Kansas
City, winch were $90,000,000
last week, an increase of jto,
nno,!!!,!! over the same week the
year liefere.
Investment bankers say that
future, investment issues must
yield fi per com and be high
grade securities at that.
tt is a striking fact thai
municipal bonds are in great
demand, even the bonds of
small cities, und lb.it 41 per
cent interests carries them
where 5 per cent was demand?
ed in 1014.
In HI commodities used by
the general public, figures
from all parts of the country
east of Denver show high and
raising prices. This indicates
prosperity und also high cost of
living.
The demand for dry goods is
heller than sine; 1900.
When times are poor the
piano business is poor. Such u
-remarkable demand for pianos
has sprung up, that all factories
are working to the limit.
The Western Union Tele?
graph Company and the tele?
phone trust report heavy in?
crease in earnings. This is as?
cribed largely to increased use
of the wire by buyers, who are
flooding manufacturers with
i orders.
Railroad figures show gross
earnings running about 10 per
cent ahead of a year ago, with
every indication of breaking
tiie record soon.
When many men are out of
w?.rk at the beginning of win?
ter, Chicago is their mecca.
were .100,ink) idel men in
that city last winter, the chari?
ties officials.say that there are
no idle men in Chicago today.
