ITALY SENT AID.
lMonteneKrlll DefrnsUe

.p citf fablr TiHpateh to Tnt Sos,
Ito.vtt:, Jan. IS. The myrtery that
veils the question why Italy, despite the
fact that slui assumed control of the
military nnd naval operations in tne
Adriatic since 1 ist May, neglected to
siipplv guns to Montenegro and to aid
her otherwise against the Austrian peril
and to prevent an Invasion of Albania
will probably not be holved until after
the war.
What Is absolutely ceitaln Is that
both political and military reasons of a
complex character Influenced Italy's de-
c'.don to - abandon Montenegro to ner
fate. Previous to Unit's Intervention
In the war Montenegro had ls-en sup
piled with guns nn, munitions by both
France and liussla. Yet when the
Anglo-French naval forces nttoc.ked
Citt.iro Montenegio's cooperation In the
defence of that poit was insignificant
It was rirn sii.prrtnl at that time
that the Montenegrins wrre setrrtljr
Irugued wilh the Austrian.
After Italy's Intervention had ome to
pass, Montenegro expected Italy's aid.
This aid was Impossible at that time
since all available guns had been sent
to the Halo. Austrian front.
Meanwhile Montenegro continued In
active. It was mghlllcnlit that she did
well!
not molest Austria It Is now
known that iennany offend n ".paratei Failure on th" part or tne orces. viov
peace to Montenegro on the condition eminent 'o meet th'" demand will repult
that she would not aid Serbia. This
infer was tefiiscd, but the actual Mon
tenegrin aid given to Seibl.1 wa Insig
nificant. Finally, when the Italian expedition
went to Albania. Italian troops were not
sent to Monti negro, which fined nn Aus
trian ml v.ui(. Fnalded, .Montenegro
made a pietciuv of resistance and weakly
opposed the Austrian cotniuiist of Mount
i
The prevailing conviction h-re l that
even bad Italy aldid .Montenegro, me
i01liUe.st of Mount
have been averted.
