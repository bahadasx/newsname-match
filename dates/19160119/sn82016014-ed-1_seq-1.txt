dition to the fact that many of the I
men employed in the mine were re-

now facing a coal famine at a number :
of the institutions.
Reports from the penitentiary indi
cate that the working: force in the
penitent iary mine has been reduced
from 300 to 24." since the mutiny. Of
the men now in the mines, it is stated
that seventy are required to look after
ixi-ck work and push cars. This leaves
175 men available for actual work in
the mines, as against a force of 220
men, formerly used in the mining: of
coal.
I'ood Shoruifre, Too.
The coal shortage at the prison is
Fair! to be a direct result of the food
shortage order issued by Warden Cod
ding some weeks ago. At that time
ordered a reduction in the rations for
the men working In the mines. A
mutiny followed and lives "of
several prison employees and officers
were endangered. Prison employees
were held as prisoners by the convicts
until Warden Codding sent word that
the demand for mure food would be
granted.
Since the mutiny a number of men
have been taken from the mines and
the state lias been facing a coal fam
ine. The out put of the mines has
been reduced 600 tons a week, accord
ing to reports from the prison, and
unless the supply is increased, several
institutions may 1-e required to buy
coal from private dealers.
Under a system adopted by the state,
all state institutions are supplied with
coal from the prison mines. A short-
a&e in lne output at this season of the
year may mean a coal famine at sev
eral of the institutions where the coal
supply is low. Last week the state
heating- plant faced a shutdown when
the coal supply was diminished to a
two days supply. Arrival of a limited
1 amount from the prison saved the
tstate the necessity of shutting down
the heating- plant or buying from pri

That He W ill Give Up the Place

IT IS NO BLUFF THIS TIME
Says He Cannot Make a Living
Out of It.
Asks a Few Days to Look for
Another Job.
"Harve" Parsons, chief of police,
has served notice of his resignation on
Mayor J. E- House, but asks that be
fore it becomes effective he be given
a few days' vacation in order that he
may look for a job.
"Before resigning for keeps,' he
says in a letter to the mayor, "I want
a few days' vacation so I may look for
a job. I have been living on my wages
or trying to and can't afford even
the luxury of a week without pay."
This time there is no joke about
Chief Pansons's resignation. It is the
real thing. It follows the announce
ment by Mayor House that apparently
there was no way to increase the sal
ary of the chief from $1,500 to $1,800
a year. Mayor House invited criticism
by announcing publicly that he pro
posed to ask Parsons to resign, to get
an ordinance through the city com

appoint him. It was plainly an

the fire it was necessary to change the
hose lines. A street car ran over one
section of hose but Chief Hanlon
stated that caused no delay whatever.
The fire was held in check with the
chemical line while the hose lines
were transferred.
Ridings stated to the fire depart

that the fire not only destroyed all
his stage paraphernalia but the play
upon which he had been working for
three years.

KANSASJN FIGHT
State Will Join West Virginia
in a Legal Battle.
Effort to Save the Webb-Ken-yon
Law to the Country.
BRIEF IS BEING PREPARED NOW
Place of Delivery of Liquor
Shipment a Place of Sale.
Measure in Kansas Legislature
Caused Scandal.
Kansas is to participate in the fight
to uphold provisions of the federal
Webb-Kenyon liquor law. Briefs
concerning the constitutionality of the
federal law are this week being pre
pared in the office of S. M. Brewster,
attorney general, and will be used be
fore the United States supreme court
in an appeal from West Virginia.
The Virginia officials nsked the Kan
sas legal department to assist in the
fight to save both the federal law ana
subseauent state statutes.
Xearly a week will be required to
brief the big case which will come
before The United States supreme
court at an early date possibly in
February. John Hunt, assistant at
torney general, is preparing the brief
regarding the constitutionality of the
Webb-Kenyon act.
The big issue involved in the case
appealed from West Virginia In a
state statute making tne place of de
livc ry of a liquor shipment the plucdi
of sale. This law was upheld by the
United States circuit court of appeals
and is now up to the highest tribunal
of the nation. A bill similar to the
provisions of the West Virginia act
was introduced in the Kansas legis
lature in 1915 by Robert Stone,
speaker of the house of representa
tives. A S vandal Arose.
It was concerning the defeat of this
measure that a scandal arose which
ultimately resulted in the removal of
Henry T. Zimmer as Kansas City,
Kan., election commissionc r. Zimmer
was active in the defeat of the bill,
and it was charged that he represent
ed the Missouri liquor interests in hi3
fight on the bill.
Should the West Virginia statute
and the federal law be upheld by the
I "nited States supreme court, a fight
will be made to adopt provisions of the
West Virginia law in Kansas In 1917.
Such an act, it is asserted, would
mean absolute prohibition.
'A decision in favor of West Vir
gin la means absolute state wide pro
hibition, said Hunt today in discuss-
ing the important suit now pending,
rI he West Virginia law. which follows George W. Rooks also testified that

urged by General Rrewster during the ' in-law of Miss- Emily Burger, identifed
1915 legislature and was introduced by I the card Mrs. Mohr wrote him urging
fapeaker istone.
The West Virginia suit is the result
of an action brought by that state
against the Adams Express company.
When the case is submitted to the
supreme court, it is probable that At
torney General Brewster will assist
in the argument. Brewster expects to
go to Washington in February and it
is possible that the case may be sub
mitted at that time. Because of the
effect which a favorable decision
would have in curbing the liquor in
dustry in Kansas, the attorney gen
eral's office has been active in its work
on i rie ea.se aim consemeo. to prepare j
orlets concerning the constitutional
questions involved.

Washington, Jan. 19. Elimination,

with all arms, ammunition and equip
ments, including ships, and to report
on the legislation necessary to prevent
private manufacture of such products.
"I agree that war may come to this
country," Senator Cummins declared,
"but if it comes it must be the result
of the calm, dispassionate, loyal pur
pose to meet the awful scourge be
cause there is no other way of de
fending our civilization, our irstitu-

that every person or corporation
which may profit frcm war would in
cite war, but I do assert that all such
persons and associations are not com
petent to judge the controversies
which may lead to conflict, and inas
much as they can not be removed
from the great panel of the republic,
they ought to be removed from the
business out of which the interest
stows. It ought to be made impossi

NEEDS OF FLEET
Fifteen Bad Features Being
Remedied, Says Daniels. J
Atlantic Fleet in Better Condi
tion Than Ever Before.
Washington. Jan. 19. Secretary'
Daniels, in transmitting to the senate
naval committee Admiral Fletcher's
annual report for the year ending
June 30, 1915, states that steps have
been taken to remedy fifteen specific
complaints as to the condition of the
Atlantic fleet, detailed by the admiral
and summarized by Mr. Daniels as
follows:
"Shortage of officers; shortage of
men; lack of fast armored cruisers
and fast light cruisers; limitations of
mobility and seagoing qualities of sub
marines; lack of air craft; lack of
radio direction-finders; too frequent
overhaul of battleships; necessity of
maintaining full complements in ac
tive ships of the fleet; need of addi
tional mining and sweeping vessels;
desirability of mobilizing ships in re
serve annually with active fleet; ne
cessity of increased facilities at fleet
rendezvous; need of battle target prac
tice at long ranges; provision for di
vision c immanders for mining and
auxiliary divisions; provision for more
speed in fighting craft intended to
j operate with the tteet; neea oi anu
I aircraft guns."
Shows fleets Weakness,
j The summary is denoted as show
; ing the "principal weaknesses and re
i quirements of the fleet." Many of
j them are of long standing. Secretary
j Daniels letter says, and some were in
j process of correction before the re
! port was made.
"Others within the scope of the de
i partment's authority have since been
j remedied," the letter adds, "and rec
' ommendations are already before con
j gress for such other needs as the de
partment has approved and cannot
I provide without congressional action.
!We have already acted upon practical
ly every suggestion.
After a detailed description of other
work in progress Secretary Daniels
says: ;
"The foregoing facts demonstrate,
conclusively, that the fleet is better
organized, the ships more fully man
ned and more competently officered
than heretofore, that our gunnery is
steadily improving and that most of
the requirements of the fleet, enumer
ated by the commander in chief while
of long standing, have already been
largely corrected." -
