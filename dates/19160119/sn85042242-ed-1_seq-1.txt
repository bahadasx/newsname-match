•i BE ENDORSED
BY LEAGUE?
Progressives in Fargo Have Busy
Day on Presidential Situ­
ation.
CUMMINS MAY WITHDRAW
FROM NORTH DAKOTA
John Burke Seeks Senatorial En­
dorsement of Non-Partisan
(League.
Fargo, N. D., Jan. 18.—Robert M.
La Follette's name will be placed
upon the North Dakota presidential
primary ballot. The members of the
North Dakota Progressive Republican
league in session here today received
word from Walter Houser La Fol­
lette's political manager, that the
Wisconsin senator would try to cap­
ture the delegation as he did l'our
years ago the North Dakota delega­
tion.
No Contest for North Dakota.
R. A. Nestos, whom Cummins had
designated as his campaign manager
for North Dakota, is doing his best
to have the Iowa senator withdraw
and leave the field clear for "Fight­
ing Bob." William Langer, secretary
of the league, stated this evening
that if La Follette's name was pre­
sented, Cummins would withdraw
his name and not precipitate a con­
test.
A telegram was sent to Cummins
by Nestos asking him to withdraw
from this state in favor of La Fol
lette. No reply was received so that
there is no higher authority than the
league members that Cummins will
not contest with La Follette fov
North Dakota's support.
There were about 150 members of
Iho league present, but all day was
spent in determining to support La
Follettc. Those present voted to se­
lect him in preference-to-Cummins on
the' 'ground that "they believed lie
would make a stronger candidate in
thife state.
Seeks to Rehabilitate Self.
It, was hinted ihat there is a, work­
ing agreement between LaFollette
and Cummins. The Wisconsin sena­
tor, whose power ia fast winning in
Wisconsin, hopes to rehabilitate him­
self by securing North Dakota's en­
dorsement. His friends admit there
is little hope of his landing the presi­
dential nomination, but they want to
help him re-establish his political for­
tunes in Wisconsin, where his politi­
cal machine has been badly shatter
ed.
The Cummins men sought to elimi­
nate La Follette but they were out­
numbered. Remnants of the La Fol­
lette organization that carried this
state four years ago were firmly in
the saddle and Cummins men did not
have a look in.
Still Skeptical.
There are Cummins men, however,
who felt that the Iowa senator would
allow his name to go upon the ballot
and try conclusions- with. La Follette.
They will not be convinced of a work­
ing agreement with La Follette until
they receive a confirmation directly
from,..the Iowa senator.
*T .Select Ten Delegates.
•j Tomorrow- the members expect to
select ten delegates who will seek
cjeetidn At the primaries as La Fol­
lette men.--pledged to stand hitched
until: ithe 5 Wisconsin senator releases
'them. iJftsthea-B is time enough, state
afteits atoyjiroidiscussed. ,It was not
knentai'Whether Thomas Marshall of
Oakes, present national committee­
man, would be endorsed to succeed
himBelf.
Burdirk men were out in force and
the indications are that he will re­
ceive the endorsement for governor.
There was little discussion of the sen­
atorial situation, although both Mc
Cumber and Hanna seemed to have
their friends among the delegates.
Officers of the league were not sure
just how complete the State would be
when the meeting adjourned. It will
probably be in session for several
days. The Grain Growers convention
in session also, and the annual meet­
ing of the Farmers' Co-operative ex­
change- 'scheduled for tomorrow,
brought many people to the city,
among whom are members of the
league.
There is a quite a gathering of the
members of the Non-Partisan league.
It was rumored that this organization
will enter the Democratic primaries.
United States Treasurer Burke's
friends are working hard for its en­
dorsement and Dr. Platou, mayor of
Valley City, seems the favorite as the
gubernatorial tandidate because of
his endorsement of the tenets of this
organization.

Canadian Government Leader
Says Nation Is in Grave Jeo­
pardy.
Ottawa, Ont., Jan. 18.—James
Loughead, government leader in the
senate, declared in a speech in the
upper house of parliament, today that
Germany was known to desire pos­
session of Canada as a prize of war,
should she be victorious in the pres­
ent conflict. Some Canadians, he
said, could not yet realize that Cana­
da was in as great jeopardy as Great
Britain or any of her allies. He ex­
pressed the belief that Germans liv­
ing in the United States would be
glad to aid in the capture of Canada.
ON IILIM DHLS
Administration Hopes to Force a
Vote On Issue in the Near
Future.
Washington, Jan. 18— Congression­
al machinery was directed today to­
ward the bills which finally will be
drawn and brought to a vote as a re­
sult of the administration'^ program
for strengthening the army and es­
tablishing a definite military policy
for the nation.
Before the senate military commit­
tee, the war department's plans were
reviewed by Secretary Garrison, vir­
tually as lie presented them to the
house committee last week. Briga­
dier General Skirven, chief signal
officer, was questioned closely by the
house committee about the aviation
work of the army.
Garrison Examined.
The trend of Secretary Garrison's
examination by the members of the
senate committee indicated less oppo­
sition there to the tflan of the conti­
nental army than had been Shown In
the house committee. Mr. Garrison
again urged that the president be al­
lowed wide discretion in the organi
station of this force. He expressed
strong opposition to payment1 of na
tional guardsmen by the federal gov­
ernment.
General Skirven placed the produc­
ing capacity of American aeroplane
factories at 20 complete machines a
day. The United States certainly
could count, he thought', on several
hundred machines a month in time
of war.
To Stump Country.
President Wilson is planning to as­
sume personal leadership in the fight
for a stronger army and navy. So
many reports have reached him of
confusion over the issue before con­
gress and of the uncertainty of the
outcome that he has determined not
only to go before the country in pub­
lic addresses, but to confer further
on the subject with leaders of the
senate and house-
He is said to be firmly of the opin­
ion that that the program prepared
by Secretary Garrison and Secretary
Daniels is the best that can be offer­
ed at this time.
Plans for the speaking trip will be
'prepared as quickly as possible.

HAS COLLAPSED
American Members But One Re­

Lindsey Quits Also,
The Hague, Jan. 18.—While prepar­
ing for the proposed departure to
Stockholm, where it is intended to
begin sessions in an attempt to bring
about the termination of the war, the
Ford Permanent Peac^ board was
threatened with disruption today by
refusal of all members to proceed on
the trip tp Stockholm. Of the five
American members of the board, only
Dr. Charles F. Aked has announced
his willingness to go to Stockholm.
Mrs. Joseph Fels, of Philadelphia,
says she is going to England on busi­
ness. William .1. Bryan, Henry Ford
and Miss Jane Addams, who are the
other American members, are still in
America, and as nothing has been
heard from them, members of the ex­
pedition here are much perplexed
over the absence of news concern­
ing them.
Schwimmer Starts Trouble.
The disagreement developed over
five alternates, Madame iRoseika
Schwimmer, who is employed by Mr.
Ford as a peace expert announced
that she had cabled to Ford for per­
mission to dismiss John D. 'Berry of
San Francisco, who was elected an
alternate member of the permanent
peace board by members of the expe­
dition, most of whom are now home­
ward bound on the steamer, Rotter­
dam.
IMadame Schwimmer says she will
appoint Harry Evans of Des Moines.
The objection to Mr. Berry is that he
refused* to sign a statement, on board
the steamer, Oscar II., denouncing
President 'Wilson's preparedness pol­
icy. The other alternates Reclined
to proceed to Stockholm.
Lindsey Tired of "Peace."
Judge iBen Lindsey of Denver flays
he is preparing to leave the party
and is going to Germany in an at­
tempt to formulate a plan to relieve
the children of belligerent countries.
The 'Rev. Jentcin Lloyd Jones of Chi­
cago, another alternate, says that he
is preparing to leave on the steamer,
Ryndan, on January 24, for New
York.
The situation, as it now appears,
eliminates all American members of
the permanent peace board for the
present, except for Dr. Aked and, pos­
sibly, 'Mr. Evans, unless 'Mr. Bryan
and Mr. Ford come to The Hague or
Stockholm.
Gaston Plantiff, personal represent­
ative for Mr, Ford, has received ca­
blegram instructions to return to Am­
erica and explain the situation to his
employer. In the meantime, Mad­
ame Schwimmer is pleading with the
American members of the expedition
to remain together and work for
peace, inasmuch as $375,000 already
has been spent upon the expedition.
Other difficulties arose over the
manner of reaching Stockholm. The
German government late today grant­
ed permission to 32 Scandinavian
members of the party to return to
their homes through German terri­
tory. It is expected that they will
leave tomorrow, crossing Germany in
a sealed train.
Twenty-five Americans, including
Dr. Aked and business staff, have
been refused permission to go
through Germany.

Much Territory Flooded and Da­
mage Runs Into Many Millions

Los Angeles, Jan. 18.—New dan­
gers from flood waters which have
accumulated in the mountain regions
today threatened to increase the
property damage, already enormous,
as the result of the rain storm which
has held all of southern California
in its grip for more than three days.
Flood conditions also prevailed in
sections of- Arizona, but no damage
or loss of life is reported there.
The loss of life from drowning re­
mained at four tonight.
Many sections of California were
without means of communication to
the outside world as the result of
the damage to the telegraph and tele­
phone systems, which railroad traffic
was greatly delayed.
The local government weather fore­
caster announced that the backbone
of the storm had been broken.

FIRST ROUND
Gibbons Puts Him to Sleep in
About One Min­

ST. PAUL PHANTOM
GIVEN OVATION
English Lad Gets Knockout Blow
Squarely On His
Jaw.
St. Paul, Jan. IS.—Mike Gibbons,
of St. Paul, knocked out Young
Ahearn in the first round of their
scheduled ten-round bout here to­
night.
The fight had been in progress
about a minute and a half when Gib­
bons worked his man over to the cor­
ner and with a smashing right swing
to the .jaw sent him to the floor for
the count.
Ahearn raised his head slightly at
the count to four, but his eyes closed
again and his head bumped the floor.
Seconds carried him to the corner
and it was three minutes before he
gained consciousness.
Ovation for Gibbons.
The thousands of fans howled,
scores rushed into the ring and car­
ried Gibbons away on their shoulders
Just before the fight started it was
announced from the ring that a tele­
gram had been received from Les
Darces of Australia challenging the
winner of tonight's contest for a
battle "to decide the middleweght
championship of the world."
Ahearn weighed in at the ringside
at 154% and Gibbons tipped the
scales at 155%.
Both boys seemed a trifle nervous
before the bell, but both were confi­
dent. Ahearn said he was in good con­
dition and a moment before they
clashed said "St. Paul loses its favor-
Closed Quickly.
They came together like a flash
and exchanged blows. Gibbons sent
a. left jab to Ahearn's ribs, hul, it ap­
parently did no damage. They
Inched and both displayed speed
at in-fighting. As they backed off,
some stiff right arm jabs were ex­
changed, but without telling results.
Both were last on their feet.
In a world-wide exchange of blows
at long range, Ahearn landed a left
on his opponent's jaw, and Gibbon's
head rocked slightly. They clinched
again and neither had an advantage
in the break-away.
Rushed Ahearn to Corner.
Then. Mike stepping lively, rushed
his opponent to the corner of the
ring, with a volley of rather light.
Ahearn swung, but missed. There
was another quick exchange, then
Gibbons sent the slashing right hand
blow which landed squarely on the
English lad's jaw and he dropped to
the floor like a log.
At the count of ten, Gibbons tried
to lift his fallen opponent's head, but
seconds relieved him of the task.
Jack McQuigan, of Philadelphia,
referee the bout.
Buff Seidl Broke Arm.
In the semi-windup Buff Seidl of St.
Paul, after severely punishing Leo

of the fight, but in the last two

conspiracy to furnish American pass­
ports to German reservists returning
home by neutral ports, is believed to
be dead, federal prosecuting authori­
ties said here today.
Advices received from England, it
was said, indicate that von Wedell,
who was taken from the Norwegian
American liner Bergensfjord by the
British authorities while attempting
to escape from this country, wa's
drowned with many others when a
naval vissel conveying him from Kirk­
wall to a British alien enemy deten­

Berlin, Jan. 18.—In the Prussian

Heldebrand, the conservative leader,
referred incidentally to America as
among Germany's worst enemies.
Germany, he said, enjoyed the splen­
did feeling of being innocent of all
the horrors of this war.
"I should not wish to bear the re­

among which America must now be
reckoned, because it prolonged the
war for at least one year," he declar­

Representative London of That
Party Gives Stirring Address
Against Preparedness.
Washington, Jan. 18.—Every So­
cialist in the United States would de­
fend this country if attacked by a
foreign foe, Representative London,
the only Socialist in congress, told
the house today in an address against
preparedness.
The house shouted down attempts
to limit Londons' time. His declara­
tion that the Socialists would fight,
was greeted with thunderous ap­
plause. Representative O'Shaugh
nessy of Rhode Island demanded of
Lund en ,whatrwoi4,d ,)).e. the, attitude
of the Socialists in case the Ameri­
can flag were attacked.
"I desire to say that, if the people
of the United States were attacked,
every Socialist would fight," London
replied.
"What is the distinction between
the flag and the people?" half a doz­
en Representatives immediately ask­
ed in as many different ways, while
London smiled and answered the
question.
"The people throb with life," he
said, "while a flag is an emblem only.
Any lunatic from an insane asylum
can attack the flag and trample on it,
but it is a vastly different thing for
an attack to be made on the people."
London then was asked if he sup­
ported a Socialistic pledge against
enlistment.
"As for me," he answered quickly,
"if we were attacked, nothing would
prevent me from sacrificing my life."
OFFER PLANS
Indianapolis, Jnd., Jan. 18.—Two in
cidents that stood out in the opening
proceedings of the biennial conven
tion of the United Mine Workers of
America here today were the hearty
approval given by the 1300 delegates
when ^President John P. White said
that the miners should share in the
present prosperity, and the waves of
applause that followed the declara­
tions of the mine leaders and Secre
tary-Treasurer Greene that the work­
ing men of the company were oppos­
ed to the present preparedness agita­
tion.
President White also touched on
preparedness and his denunciation of
war and opposition to preparedneess
on a large scale brought real ap­
plause in the* convention. He said he
was fully confident that the men of
labor are opposed to the whole
scheme of preparedness and added
that it is to be "earnestly moved that
the plans to make our country an
armed camp which may be used to
exploit commercialism abroad and ex­
ploit labor at home will be defeated."
HOOD THM

days must elapse before the experi­
ment may be called conclusive.

London, Jan. 1®.—The
New Year's Battle Over.
"The Austro-Wungarlan arms were
completely victorious on the 80-mile
battle front. The great New Year's
battle began December 24, and ended
January 15.
"The .Russians' losses were at least
70,000 killed and wounded and nearly
6,000 Russians were made prisoners
by Austro-Hungarions. All the Aus­
trian nations took part in the New
Year's battle.
Lutsk, the important fortress in
Volhynia, one of the triangle of forti­
fications there, is being evacuated 'by
the Germans, according to informa­
tion obtained from prisoners arriving
here. Four thousand prisoners have
recently arrived here from the south­
western front.
Many Joined Servians.
London, Jan. 18.—According to re­
ports received by the Exchange Tele­
graph company from Cettinje, King
Nicholas of Montenegro has issued a
proclamation to his people, declaring
that surrender was necessary In or*
der to prevent the complete rata of
his country. The white flag was
hoisted at Grahovo, where the king
handed his sword to General Heriees.
Generals Oistovic and Valutovec,
refusing to surrender, the advices
add, escaped and joined the Serbians.
London, Jan. 18.—The steamer,
Ryndon, which had been sighted in
distress and believed to have struck
a mine or to have been torpedoed,
has arrived at Gravesend. The pas­
sengers, who did not land at Fal­
mouth, will remain on board in ac­
cordance with official instructions.
iNone of them was injured.
With the ending of the Montene­
grin campaign by the capitulation of
the Montenegrins to the Austro-Hun
garians, hostilities for the moment
have ceased in the Balkans, although
a dispatch from Athens reports the
dropping of bombs by 25 French aei
oplanes on a Bulgarian position north
east of Saloniki. Hundreds of Bul­
garians are declared to have been
killed in this attack and a very- large
number wounded.
The British and iFrench, oa the
western line, continue their artlllev?

Greece Center of Interest
From a political point of "view,
Greece has again become a center of
great interest. In addition to the re­
ports that the 'Entente allies have or­
dered Greece to hand passports to
the representatives of the Central
powers in the kingdom, comes the
assertion that 'British and (French
troops have been landed at Corinth,
48 miles west of Athens.
Greece Surrounded.
Should the latter report prove true,
the 'Entente allies would have a. line
of bases almost surrounding Greece,
at Saloniki on the east, at Coripth
on the south, and at Corfu on the
west.
Hostilities Cease.
The official communication of the
Austrian headquarters, dated .today,
says:
"The negotiations concerning de­
tails for the capitulation of' the Mon­
tenegrin army began yeBterday and
the Austrian troops, which in the
meantime had occupied Virbazar and
Rieka, ceased hostilities.
"The New Year's battle in east.Ga
