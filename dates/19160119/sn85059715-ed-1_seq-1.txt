Little
New Light is Thrown
upon Happenings in Greece
of Late.
Further news came to hand today
of the campaign in the Caucasus j
where the Russians recently began an
offensive over a wide rront and aa- j
lnittedly have been making progress f
against the Turks. Constantinople!
now announces that the Ottoman!
armies resisting the Russian advance i
nave oeen re-emorcea aua uave
checked the Russians along the entire
front.
Grand Duke Nicholas's forces have I p
suffered severely in the lighting nur-1 e
ing the last eight days, according to; n
the Turkish statement, which claims; s
that the situation now is favorable to ?
the Turks, only slight changes In po- c
sltions having been effected by the j,
Russian operations. s,
On the other hand a Petrograd of- j j,
ficial statement claims that the cam- c
paign in the Caucasus Is developing ^
favorably to the Russians, who have ^
taken strong Turkish positions with.
comparatively slight losses, while the
Turks have suffered heavily. Good n
progress also is being made in the
Russian campaign in Persia, Petro- ]
grad declares. j
Importance Is attached to these
operations because although appar-i
ently Isolated they arc held by many I
military observers as to be taken j
into consideration in connection with | .
the British campaign in Mesopota- fl
mia, all three movements concerging
upon the easternmost part of the j

Increases In foreign trade lmve resulted
In new machinery, new factories
and new additions to factories,
l'lanls abandoned for many years
have been fitted up as shops. We now
have far greater manufacturing plan?
capacity than ever before.
There Is no longer a home market
enough to consume the capacity production
of our plants. So, when the
war ends we will have this alternative:
either to dismantle the excess
factories, scrap the machinery, throw
men out of work by the thousands,
and create a tremendous economic
loss, or to develop foreign mnrkets
and keep our plants running at capacity.
Factory Efficiency Will Win Trade.
Whether we can hold our new foreign
markets, and develop them still
further, depends upon two things:
the quality of our goods and their
price. Of the quality there is no
question. American goods are regarded
as the best In evety foreign
market. It is a question, then, of
price, and in that we nre at a disadvantage.
We can meet European prices in
