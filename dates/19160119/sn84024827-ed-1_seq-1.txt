per Company, Formally Joined by the Laying of the Last
Rail from Gila Bend. Regular Train Service will Become
operative Three Weeks from the Present Date.
(Special to The Review (
CORNELIA, Arizona. Jan. 18. The last rail of the connecting link be
tween the mammoth New Cornelia Copper Company's property and the
outside world, the markets for its production of red metal, was laid at
noon today. The tract, though in the rough, is completed and every day,
until a regular schedule is introduced along the line which is expected
in three weeks from date, the finishing touches on the big job will be
made. I
The completion of the railroad into Cornelia, Arizona, marks an era in
Pima county mines and mining. It marks a rejuvenation of one of the
oldest copper districts in the great southwest. It adds another great
property to Arizona's world of industry, offering to both producer and
consumer a new copper factory and a new market.
It is anticipated that work on the big leaching plant, for which plans
have been underway for many months, will be started at once. When
the plant will be completed it is difficult to say but the assurance is giv
en that no time will be lost in making the New Cornelia Copper Compa
ny one of the ranking copper porphyry producers in the world.

Senate Military Committee
Hears Garrison Outline the
Administration's Plans for
National Preparedness. '
WASHINGTON. Jen. 18 The Pre
sident lias decided to make a public
addiess a'ld confer further with lead
ers of Congress urging the light for
a stronger army and navy. The ac
tion wai decided upon because of the
confusion over the issues and the un
certainty of the outcome.
Wilsoj was informed by Representa
tives Hay and Padgett, chairmen of
the naval and military committees,
that it would be six weeks to two
months before the committee would
be rtady to report on an army or
navy appropriation bills. While this
is goiag on the President proposes to
solidify sentiment among the people
and members of Congress in favor of
the plans of the War and Navy De
partments. Frie ids of the President represent
him as being undeterred by the op
position of Bryan and other pacifists
and the differences among the advo
cates of defense over the plans to be
adopted. He is said to be of the
opinio l that the program of Garrison
and Daniels Is best. The plans tor
speaking trips will be prepared as
quickly as possible.
IN CONGRESS.
WASHINGTON. Jan. 18. Commit
tees of both Houses considered the
formulation of bills as a result of the
Administration's program for strength
ening the army. Before the Senate
Military Committee, the War Depart
ment's plans were reviewed by Garri
son virtually as presented to the
House committee last week. Quarter
master General Aleshire and General
Scriven, Chief Signal Officer, testified
before the House committee. The lat
ter was questioned about aviation
work.
Major General Wood, commander
of the Department of the East, ap
peared before the Senate committee.
Tomorrow he will be followed by
Major General Carter, retired, author
of the recent book on the United
States military situation. Garrison's
examination indicated less opposition
to the continental army plan than in
the House.
Garrison expressed opposition to
the payment of national guardsmen
by the federal government. He said:
"The one thing that has prevented
the working out of an adequate mili
tary policy has been the attitude of
the state troops. If we put them on
the federal payroll, we could never
get a sensible military policy."
Scriven placed the capacity of the
American aeronlane factories at twen
ty each dav. He said he might count
on several hundred a months in case
or war. He urged that at least
eighteen aero squadrons be creafd
under the proposed increase of the
regular army.

DRUG USERS
I
Marshal Allison Advises the
People of Bisbee Not to
; Give to Beggars as Best
Way to Rid Bisbee of Them.
That wita the promulgation of the
Harrison Drug Law, which went into;
effect last spring, the "hop heads",!
"snow fiends" and drug users, gener-l
ally, have been flocking to border j
points is the contention of City Mar-,
shal James Allison. That the city of-j
fleers intend to fight this plague of,
humanity is another assertion which
was made las night by the same of
ficial. .
"A year ago," safd' 'Illson' yester
day, "the drug fiends were scarce in
Bisbee. Now they are plentiful and
in cities, nearer the Mexican border
than Bisbee, they are literally over
running the officers.
"This Is due to the fact. that the
drug users in places nearer the center
of the country are having a very dif
ficult time in securing what they use.
Along the border drugs are smuggled
into the United States aid are easier
secured. I would say that the drug
users in this section have multiplied
many times since last summer. .
In the past drug fiends did not
"light" in the Warren District. There
was little for them to do here. The
work to be secured was of such char
acter that a habitual user could not
stand the strain. With the gradual
elimination of the traffic In other
parts of the country, however, they
are making the border cities their
refuge. j
The increase in this form of indi
gency Is also to be found in the num
ber of "rhoochers" who are to be
found in Bisbee. In the railroad
towns, like Douglas and Tucson, the
evil is far worse than in the Warren
District, according to the officers, but
even here it is sufficiently bad to
cause the officers much trouble. j
"We are making every effort to
have these undesirables leave the
city," continued Allison. "But they
keep under cover as much as possible
and make no breaks while any of the
officers are around. ' The force Is do
ing all in its power to make this
form of tramp an unwelcome attrac
tion in Bisbee. but without the sup
port of the people of the community
this Is Impossible. i
"I would sucgest that no person in
Bisbee aid one of these 'n-onchera. j
When they are given anvthin.T It Is
merely making it harder for th
police to rid the city or tne evit. i
