MEXICAN CHIEF
REPLIES TO NOTE
Carranza Will Punish Murder
ers of Americans.
ISSUE BEFORE CONGRESS
Senate Fortlgn Relations Committee
Will Take Up the Matter of Con
firming Fletcher's Appointment as
Ambassador Some Opposition.
Washington, .Ian. 17. (Seneral Car
ranza has replied to the American
note demanding the punishment of
the bandits who perpetrated the
wholesale massacre of seventeen
Americans.
The message of Consul Silllman re
citing the reply of Carranza was:
"Your note relating to the massa
cre of Americans at Santa Isahelll,
received and immediately placed be
fore General Carranza, who said he
had already Issued orders for the Im
mediate pursuit, capture nnd punish
ment of those responsible for the
atrocity.
"He stated that he believed that
this outrage committed was connect
ed directly with Villa and done es
pecially to provoke International trou
bles at this time. He said that he
had declared that those guilty be pun
ished by death. He says that nobody
can lament more than ho that such
atrocity occurred, but that even In
the best regulated states outbursts of
disorder and lawlessness may cause
destruction of property and loss of
life.
"Ho says lie is expecting- full re
ports from General Trevlno and that
all efforts will be niado to protect the
Americans and any other foreigners
who may lie In the district. His be
lief Is that the massacre was pre
medlatlvely made by a band of VII
listns." The state department Is still await
ing a report from 'Consul Edwards at
Juarez on the Inquires of Secretary
Lansing as to tho consul's authority
for stating that he had been hindered
from Washington to get assurances
of protection from Carranza people
for foreigners.
Secretary Lansing Is expected to
submit to congress within a few days
all Information regarding the massa
cre and conditions In Mexico.
Mexico will be tho basis of formal
consideration by the senate foreign
relations committee beginning next
Wednesday, when tho nomination of
Henry Prather Fletcher as ambassa
dor to General Carranza's government
will bo taken up. Administration
leaders are hopeful that a report rec
ommending confirmation will bo made
to the senate without delay. Several
opposition "senators, however, have
announced they will oppose such a
step, vigorously, and It generally Is
adnlUted nothing can bo done toward
confirmation until tho Republicans
have been appeased by an answer
from Prcdont Wilson to Senator
Fall's resolution askln.? for reasons
which led to recognition of Carranza.
Secretary Lansing has promised to
have data In compliance with that
resolution ready for the president
early this week and Senator Stone,
chairman of tho foreign relations com
mittee, hopes the president's reply
will bo sent to the senate In time for
the committee meeting. Wednesday.
Discussion of tho Mexican problem
on tho floor of tho senate and house Is
expected to arsa from to sldoratlon
of various Intervention resolutions.
No commltteo action on such resolu
tions Is probable at this tl'mo. Sena
tor Goro of Oklahoma, Democrat, Is
considering submitting a resolution to
direct tho use of American nrmed
forces as aids to tho Carranza forces
In protecting American citizens in a
neutral zouo in Mexico.

NOTED SPECIALIST
Tells How to Fight the Grip
Assistant Secretary of Com
merce Publishes Suggestions
of Chicago Physician.
Washington, Jan. S, Assistant Sec
retary of Commerce Sweet today pub
lished suggestions 'of Dr. Robert II.
Habcock, of Chicago, a noted blind
specialist in heart and lung diseases,
with reference to the grip epidemic
which is sweeping over the country,
Dr. llabeock says the germ that Is re
sponsible lor the nation-wide illness is
not grip, but a modification, or strain
of the pneumonia germ, and his recom
mendations follow:
Keep regular hours, get sufficient
sleep, keep the feet dry and avoid ev
erything tend'ng to impair the general
health or weaken resistance. Keep
away trom people who are coughing or
sneezing For their own good as well
as the sifety others they should be
isolated In a well-ventilated room.
Spray vour nostrils nnd throat night
and morning with a weak antiseptic so
lution. Horolypiol diluted with three
parts of water will serve this purpose
nnd may be used both as a wash for the
nose and gargle for the throat.
If you get this infection, stay hi bed.
Take plenty of bicarbonate of soda,
water Mid truit juices, and do nut go
out to long as the infection persists in
nose and throat, or so long as you have
any temperature.
ASAFOETIDA CALLED SPECIFIC
Fifteen Grains and a Period In Bed
Said to Repulse drip.
While the grip is still raging in Lou
isville, and in anticipation of more to
come when the snow now on the ground
becomes slush, it will interest thousands
in Kentucky and adjoining States to
know that there Is a simple specific It
is asafoetida.
This is vouched for by Dr IS. G.
Dice, head of The Pines Sanatorium,
who speaks from his experience nt
Dwlght, III., in the early nineties, when
there was a ery severe epidemic, and
in similar subsequent epidemics.
Dr. Dick says in the first outbreak he
and his as ociates at Dwight treated
successfully 500 or 600 cases of grip,
giving in each case fifteen grains of
asafoetidita in five grain pills, one pill
each three hours. The patient, of
course, was kept in ted while under
treatment, since tile remedy induced
sweating among other things. ,
