DATA.
i
Washington, Jan. 14.?Senator
Smith, of South Carolina today introduced
in the senate a resolution,
which was adopted, calling upon the
secretary of agriculture to gather
data and submit it to the senate relative
to the fertilizer situation, particularly
with reference to potash.
Senator Smith yesterday sent to
the commissioners of agriculture
throughout the South the following
inquiry:
"What in your opinion will be the
effect on the yield of cotton per acre
c+a+o if thp nrpspnt, fertilizer
situation is not improved, especially
as to potash?"
From each he received replies to
the effect that the reduction in yield
per acre would be anywhere from 5
to 50 per cent.
In aiscussing the purport of the
resolution, Senator Smith said: |
' 'The prospects for another year,
especially as to cotton, are that
nothing like a normal yield, possibly i
a 30 or 40 per cent reduction, will
be the result if the present fertilizer
situation is not relieved. Germany
has a monopoly of the production of
potash; Chile a practical monopoly
of the concentrated nitrates. On account
of the war situation it will be
impracticable to obtain potash from
Germany. The prices of the nitrates,
persumably on account of the increased
demand for these ingredients
in war munitions, have risen to where
they are totally impracticable for fertilizer
purposes. Phosphoric acid,
for some reason, has also risen in
price. These three ingredients, viz.,
nitrate of ammonia, phosphoric acid
and potash are absolutely essential in
the production of cotton in all of the
South Atlantic States where cotton is
produced, particularly in all of the
i coastal plains of North Carolina,
I South Carolina, Georgia, Florida and
eastern Alabama.
"If anything like an average yield
is to be had it must necessarily be at
an enormous increase of acreage an l
an enormous increase of cotton acreage
would mean a decrease of grain,
forage and the foodstuffs crops. An
increase in cotton acreage without
proper fertilization means an almost
prohibitive increase in the expense of
producing this crop. The cost of cultivation,
including labor and live
stock, would make this cost so high
that even at the present prices there
could be no profit.
"Therefore, from the present outlook
for fertilizers, the prospect for
the yield of cotton next year is the
poorest that has confronted the
South since the War of Secession."
FIVE MEN CONVICTED
IN GREENVILLE COURT
Greenville. Jan. 16.?The five men
on trial for the killing of David
Freeze, a Judson mill striker, were
found guilty of manslaughter late
Saturday, and sentenced by Judge
Gary to serve two years each. The
defendants were Gordon Brown, Tom
Harvey, I. A. Williams, Doill Huggins
and John Humphreys. Freeze
was killed during a melee which occurred
one morning just as the mill
was about to open its doors for work.
Pending the outcome of a motion
for a new trial, the five men were released
on $1,000 bond each. B. E.
Geer, president of Judson mills,
signed all the bonds. J. M. Geer,
signed with his brother for three of I
the men, while W. R. Neely and Mrs
Hendrix Rector signed with Mr. Geer .
for the other two.
The trial has caused considerable
intQj-est. The testimony was volumi- i
noift.
At the conclusion of this trial the J
court of general sessions adjourned
sine die.
TWO CANDIDATES ENTER
FIELD FOR M'LAURIN'S PLACE
I
Columbia, Jan. 17.?The election!
of a state warehouse commissioner is
beginning to attract attention and
promises to be the one election to be
filled at this session which will cause
any show of politics. John L. McLaurin,
former United States senator,
who is now filling the position is
a candidate for re-election and he is j
opposed by F. M. Cary, of Oconee,!
formerly a member of the house of |
representatives, and John J. McMa-j
han, of Columbia, a member of the !
present Richland delegation.
The friends of Senator McLaurin j
feel that he should be given another
term but this the friends of those op- j
posing him say there is nothing in ,
that. They say it is a position which j
others can fill and they have a per- j
feet right to offer.
It is understood that the position
which Senator McLaurin takes is!
that he has done the best he could
fnr the svstem under the act and that
his record justifies re-election for an- j
other term and he will not make a i
' canvass for the place or pull any J
wires to win out.
The managers of all the ware-1
houses in the state system have been
called to meet in Columbia on Tuesday
at noon in the state warehouse.
The meeting is expected to be attended
by about 200 from all parts of the
state and there is considerable interest
taken in the gathering.

LANSING OFFERS PLEA 1
FOR NEUTRAL NATIONS j
Washington, Jan. 16.?A study of
neutral rights and duties with a view
to reversing the traditional processes *
of defining neutrality which "have 11
given all the advantages to the bellig- t
erents and have shown little regard ,
for the rights of neutrals" was sug- '
gested by Secretary Lansing as one t
of the first duties of the newly form-' j
ed American Institute of Internation-;.
al Law in a letter sent by the secre- .
tary to Dr. James Brown Scott, presi-1,
dent of the institute. Mr. Lansing
is one of the five United States mem- !
bers of the institute which was organ- .
ized during the Pan-American Scien- .
tific congress here, and in which all ,
the American republics are represen-. #
ted. His letter said:
"At the first meeting of the institute
I had the honor to direct atten- ]
tion to the imperfect code of rules 1
which defines and governs the rela
tions between belligerents and neu- 1
trals. These rules, which have grown (
up during the past 125 years and !
have been in some cases differently 1
interpreted by courts of different
countries, have been frequently J
found inadequate to meet new con- j
ditions of warfare, and as a result '
every war has changed, modified or J
added to the rules, generally through 1
the process of judiical decisions.
"The prize courts of belligerents 1
have thus become the interpreters of <
belligerent right:; and neutral obliga- J
tions, and the interpretations evi
dence an unconscious prejudice aris
ing from over appreciation of the '
needs of the belligerent. Writers on 1
international law have relied upon '
these prize court decisions in dealing 1
with the subject of neutrality so 1
that they have laid down rules for- (
mulated indirectly from a belligerent *
point of view. Thus judicial decis- '
ions, text writers and international 1
agreements have given all the ad- '
vantages to the belligerents and have !
shown little regard for the rights of:
neutrals.
"It would appear that it is time
to reverse this treatment and to deal ]
with it from the point of view of the ]
neutral. I would therefore suggest ^
that a committee be appointed to ^
study neutral rights and neutral du- ,
ties, seeking to formulate in terms i
the principle underlying the relations ,
of belligerency to neutrality rather
than the express rules governing the
conduct of a nation at war to a nation
at peace. '!
"In view of the past year and a
half of war, the present time seems !
particularly opportune to study this '
question and this institute being comty?
om Kore frnm nonfrnl n n
tions is especially fitted to do this
from the proper point of view and
with the definite purpose of protecting
the liberty o?f neutrals from unjustifiable
restrictions on the high
seas and from the imposition of needless
burdens in preserving their neutrality
on land." i

MONTENEGRINS GRANTED
UNCONDITIONAL PEACE 1
1
London, Jan. 17.?Beset on the ]
east, west and north by the Austrians j
and with all lines of retreat severed,
except into Albania where hostile '
tribesmen must be faced, the little j
kingdom of Montenegro has asked
and received of Austria unconaiuon- ;
al peace. This announcement was ''
made in the Austrian parliament today,
according to semi-official advices
from Berlin.
This, if true, is the first withdrawal
of any belligerent from either of the
alliances which have been fighting \
since August, 1914. That Montenegro i
is seeking peace, however, is not ,
confirmed from Entente sources, and j
from Switzerland comes to report
that Austria offered peace terms but ,
Montenegro refused them. For days ,
however, the plight of the Montene- ,
grins has been desperate with their j
capital and many cities taken and
their army exhausted. 1
The official program for the statewide
convention to be held in Colum- 1
bia. on February G-9 under the auspices
of the Laymen's Missionary 1
movement of the United States and
Canada, has been completed and announced.

GOVERNOR iVf,

Speaks Before Joint
Policy at
Gov. Manning's address to the gen- f<:

,ion of the insane asylum, delivered ti<
yesterday, follows: jic
ai
Gentlemen of the General Assembly: J'0
In my annual message I stated that I # *
tmnarnit trt vn 11 n SDecilll I
VYUII1U but<iaiu?v __
ncssage dealing with the State Hos-1 f,1
)ital for the Insane. You have cou"-jieously
invited me to deliver this j
nessage in person. Permit me to j
hank you for this privilege.
At the outset, I wish to state clear- 1
y that in referring to the conditions _
vhich I found there when I became w
governor, it must not be ragarded as p(
i personal criticism, but rather a j4*
itatement of facts and conditions as ..
found them. I would be disengenious
if I did not make a full state- V(
nent to you of this whole siutation,
tnd its needs.
Former Conditions Intolerable.
From personal observation, I r.(
'ound, last year, the physical condi- oi
ion of this institution to be intolera- rr
>le, if we are to consider the treat- el
nent of these unfortunates as a sol:mn
duty and as an act of humane- u<
less and charity. The treatment of b(
;hose patients was custodial, rather
;han that of giving skilled treatment it
;o improve their condition of mind, ci
is well as of body. |fe
This condition was fully revealed cji
;o you in an exhaustive report made ej
Dy Dr. Herring, last year, through me m
:o you. I feel that it is unnecessary j ei
;o repeat here what was stated in ' ti
:hat document. You, in a body, at ; ti
ny invitation, visited that institution 1th
;hen, and the condition as shown by ! pi
;hat report, and by what you found j
:here, convinced you of the necessity i
?or reorganization of the institution, j cl
md a change in the treatment of the j j
nmates. I am sure that you recall i ftvividly
the picture of what you saw
'hen. gj
T invitoH vr?ii to visit i:,
I CO I'd UUfY a *11 * wv? ^ ? I ill
igain this institution so that you je
:ould see for yourselves, in a meas- w
are at least, what has been done, and w
s being: done, under the acts which a,
i'ou so wisely passed at the last ses-!
;ion of the legislature. The improve- j sj
nents in the physical property are-.v
aeing carried on in a thorough and I e.
jfficient manner, and when this work
s completed I feel that it will be an | e,
jnduring monument to your wisdom | j:i
ind humaneness in providing for the J n(
:omfort and the improved treatment I C{
if these unfortunate citizens of our w
State. p;
Last year you saw th-3 wretched u,
:ondition, the discomforts and dirt in ]e
the cells in which these people were f(
:onfiined. I saw, and you saw, how ^
the meals served were eld and un- p(
palatable. You saw in the woman's ]j,
lflnovtmont urViipVi was then the best tv
department in that institution, the
silent witnesses?those straps that C(
were around the walls, that were C(
jsed to restrain violent patients. ei
Mechanical Restraint. fc
Gentlemen, the temptation to me *
is to go on and enumerate the differ- s<
2nt things that were revolting, but I "
riave promised you not to do so. But ?]
[ can not refrain from saying: that in CJ
that women's ward and as the ward
that was then in best condition, you
will recall that in that ward for vio- ai
lent patients, there were 92 of those 01
/iolent subjects. They were confined w
in cells. We found that the fire pro- p<
tection was absolutely inadequate D1
and inoperative; we found the fire 1
nose could not be attached to the hy- cc
:lrant, because they did not fit; and m
it simply is appalling to think what a j p<
terrible disaster would have occurred I a<
nad fire broken out. If that fire had j S?
occurred in the night time, with two
nurses only, in charge of the 92 pa- j
tients, it does not require any de-1
- - - ? ?v_j. I A1
;cription from me to ten you wnai i would
have happened. ja<
I want to say to you that under the w
changed treatment that restraint for ! P'
violent subjects is no longer resorted , U1
to; but instead the kinder and more jtt
effective treatment by soothing methDds;
where they are put in baths, and
treated in simple ways, we find as j
the result those patients showed im-1 ai
provoment both in mind and in body, j P1
Gentlemen, these changes that have
been inaugurated there are a result i b<
sf your wisdom in enacting laws j bi
ivhich made the change possible; and j th
t earnestly recommend the continu- hj
unce of this work as necessary, if we i W
ire to discharge our obligation to di
these uniortunate citizens, wno nave j
the misfortune to be afflicted in this ^
tvay. ft
Changes in Personnel. ^
The acts which you passed looking | n(
;o the reorganization of this institu- | p(
:ion, and a change in the treatment j ^
)f the patients, made it necessary, i ^
n my judgment, to make import-1
int changes in the personnel of the .
nanagement of the institution. I
,vish to say here that I was confront- "
ad with serious trouble. You will
remember, gentlemen, that this act .
ivas passed and signed on the last v!
night of your session; therefore, n
ivhen the acts were before me in 10
their entirety, you had adjourned
and gone to your homes. It was not
practicable for rne to call you back l".u
here to make provision called for, for
what you had done in part.
Now, I want to say there is no
special act of the legislature which
\NNING ON

ces the salary of the superinten:nt,
except that in the appropria-jn
bill there is provision of $3,000
>r the salary of the superintendent,
id of course that fixed it. Therer
ire, 1 undertook to find a man who,
j his qualifications, and by his charter
and attainment, and his efficilcy,
would be able to put into effect
13 changes contemplated by you in
e acts that you passed.
I made an honest effort to find a
an for that salary?for $3,000. I
icd to find him for that salary, even
icing into account the perquisites
hicli went with that salary. The
jrquisites which went with it were
i follows: The superintendent had
ie use of a house, he was furnished
?hts, water, fuel, he was furnished
:getables; he was furnished such
irvants as he needed, from the in
itution; he was furnished a carriage
id pair of horses, and a driver, and
; was furnished an automobile; in
Idition to that, he had the privilege
: buying his supplies at the reduced
ites that were secured in the purlases
of goods for the institution.
A conservative estimate of the val2
of these perquisites places it easily
;tween $1,300 and $1,400 and the
3,000 salary provided for. I found
impossible to find a man, a physian,
who had, in addition to his proissionl
knowledge, those traits and
salifications of administrative and
cecutive ability which, in my judgr
ent, would qualify him to carry out
ticiently the work of reorganizaon,
change in the treatment of paents,
and general management of
lat large institution, for the salary
-ovided.
Procuring a Superintendent.
What was I to do under these cirimstances,
when I thought of those
S00 patients in that institution, suf?ring,
as they were, from lack of
eatment which advanced and proressive
skill and knowledge in that
ne of training gives. I felt that unss
I got a man as superintendent
ho had those qualifications, the acts
hich you had passed would be void
id of no effect, so far as those pawflvA
nnnrtorMfl/1 TVi o 4" wac flin
tuation that confronted me. What
as I to do? We know these patiits
would continue to lack those
imforts and cares which an enlightled,
advanced and progressive
lowledge administers. There were
3 other funds available for it. I
>uld not change his salary? there
as no fund for it, no provision to
ay it, and the question then came
p, at the same time, to me, was I to
t those patients continue to suffer
>r the lack of that necessary skill in
lis institution; or should I make a
arsonal contribution in order to reeve
their suffering and improve
leir treatment?
I determined, gentlemen, that I
>uld not endure the thought of the
jntinuance of the condition and the
ivironment of those patients. There>re,
the only thing that I saw that
could do was to go to the bank and
sc what I could do about that money
lat was needed. I was well aware
f the fact that the salary of an offial
of the State could not be increas1
during his term of office,
rherefore, when I went to the bank
id found it would take $2,375 in
der to secure the services of a man
ho, in my judgment, would fill the
>sition, the money was offered to
c at the rate of 3 per cent., so that
determined that I would make that
mtribution to this institution, giving
y personal notes for $2,375, at 3
2r cent, itnerest, so as to pay the
iditional amount which was necesiry
in order to secure him.
Doesn't Seek Reimbursement.
Then I determined to fix the term
f the superintendent to run from
ay 1, 1915, to February 15, 1S16,
; which time this honorable body
ould be in session, and I would then
at the question fairly and squarely
p to you, whether you would make
lis provision for a competent and
?ficient superintendent, or whether
>u would be willing to let the instiition
lapse back into the condition
id treatment which prevailed there
"evious to his incumbency.
Now, gentlemen, I feel that I have

rher. I have seen the improved contions
in that institution, the im ovcd
treatment, and the results of
lat treatment on those patients, T
el that I have been justified in this
mtribution. I have done it cheerilly!
I have done it gladly. I do
ask to be reimbursed for this
jrsonal contribution that I made to
ie alleviation of the suffering of
lese unfortunate fellow citizens of
irs. The consciousness of having

iursc you realize that that condition
in not continue. I could not go on

for the salary of a State offial.
and that responsibility will now

I want to say to you that the bene s

BLAME CARRANZA
FOR MASSACRE
MEXICAN QUESTION TO BE THE
CHIEF SUBJECT OF DEBATE
FOR SOME TIME.
El Paso, Jan. 17.?Victor Hamil- .
ton, of Chicago, and Albert Simmons
of Los Angeles, two American citizens,
were murdered at Pedriceni,
Mexico, by Villa bandits, according
to a dispatch from Juarez this afternoon.
The report of the killing of the
two Americans came from the Carranza
military officials at Juarez.
They declared that Simmons and
Hamilton had been killed by bandits
under the leadership of the Arreta
brothers.
ine men were mining prospectors.
The Carranza officials said that as '
far as they have been able to learn, j
the two Americans were killed with- ^
out a chance to get out of the country
and that the murders were com- 1
mitted simply because the men were
Americans and subjects of the Wilson
Administration, which is supporting '
the Carranza government.
The report of the assassination of
the Americans reached the Carranza
headquarters at Juarez shortly before
2 p. m., today. Pedriceni, the
place where the Americans were kill- !
ed, is 60 miles west of Torreon.
Safety Assurance Given to Miners.
Washington, Jan. 17.?Blame for
the' massacre of seventeen Americans
at Santa Ysabel a week ago to-day
was placed squarely on the heads of
Carranza border officials. In a detailed
statement to the State Department
of the conditions under which
the American party entered Mexico,
Collector of Customs Cobb at hi Faso
finds that the American party did not
start for the Cusi mines until assurances
had been received from de facto
officials that a military garrison
had been sent there and that "everything
was quiet."
Whether the Watson party asked
for a military escort is still undetermined.
In regard to this, Collector
Cobb telegraphed as follows:
"It is reported that a person connected
with one of the companies operating
in Chihuahua on the day the
Americans started had a conversation
with Watson and asked him if a Mexican
escort was to accompany his party.
He replied that such an escort
would not accompany them, as he had
talked with the authorities and they
had told him it was not necessary."
Collector Cobb's report follows:
r^-ii i ' D
V/Ulict IUI o t.
"Holmes, the only survivor of the
massacre, has no knowledge as to
whether Watson and companions requested
a military escort or guard
!for their trip from Chihuahua to
I Cusi. He states that if they did so
j the authorities declined to furnish'an
an escort or guard. Holmes says
that all the members of the party felt
safe in making the trip.
"Asked as to what assurances, if
any, Watson and his companions had
j received from Mexican authorities
I that it would be safe to resume operjations
at Cusi, Holmes said:
" 'Knowing that the Cusi mines
were situated at Cusi and that the
purpose of the return of Watson and
| companions to Mexico was to resume
the operations of these mines, the
'immigration authorities in Juarez,
upon application of the El Paso agent
i of the company, gave a general passport
to the party.
" 'The Governor of Chihuahua also
gave a personal passport to Watson.

'if It would be safe to resume operaj
tions. While there he got the de facto
authorities to send a garrison to and
maintain it at Cusi. On that day three
! trains of troops of twenty cars each
supposed to carry a total force of 1,100
troops, in charge of General Jose :
Cabacos, of the de factor govern- 1
ment, left Chihuahua for Cusi at 9
a. m., 1:30 and 4 p. m., respectively. <
"On January 6 the Chihuahua i
agent of the Cusi company, with i
whom I had just talked in my office, 1
telegraphed Watson at El Paso in <
reference to the above-named civil- ]
ian passengers on the second military i
train, information received by him i
from Cusi by phone, as follows: 1
'Boys arrived Cusi safely last night. 1
They found everything quiet there.' 1
"As this telegram mentioned the 1
boys without mentioning the troops, 1
Watson on the same day, to make ]
certain that a garrison was estab- j
lished at Cusi, telegraphed the Chi- <
1
uuauuu agent.
" 'Wire if troops arrived at Cusi
and trains running northwestern.'
"To which the Chihuahua agent replied
on the same day: 'Troops arrived
Cusi. Since yesterday evening
Northwestern train suspended indefinitely,
account no fuel.'
"On the same day the Chihuahua
agent also telegraphed Watson at El
Paso: 'Cusi office again reports
everything quiet', and 'Lopez tele
phones we nave just locateu two uags (
missing and we are now receiving
same in our office.'
"Messages from which the forego- ,
ing were taken were furinshed from
the Western Union office at El Paso.
"Having passports issued by authorities
and a garrison having been
established which they understood to
number 1,000 men, they had ample
asurances that it would be safe to f
resume operations at Cusi." j

It is said that the bankers of the 2
State are to make a determined fight c
before the present legislature for the v
repeal of the law creating the State t
tax commission. e
CALL TO ARMS FOR I
NATION'S BUSINESS j
PRESIDENT BEGINS WORK TO
PUT IN OPERATION PLAN FOR
QUICK MOBILIZATION.
t
Washington, Jan. 16.? President
Wilson has begun work to put into
Dperation a plan for preparing the
nation's manufacturing, railroad and
Dther business resources for quick
mobilization in case of emergency. It "i
I 1 x Lj. i.1. -i. 1_ . 1 I
uecaine Known lomgnt mat ne nas 1
written to the heads of all of the 1
principal engineering organizations 1
asking that they appoint representa- I
tives to collect data for use in or- j
Ejanizing business for national de- I
fense. I
The letters went to the president j
of the American Institute of Mining j
Engineers; the American Society of
Mechanical Engineers; the American
Society of Civil Engieners; the Amer- j
ican Institute of Electrical Engi- 1
neers and the American Chemical 1
society. The work of collecting data
will be carried on by the representatives
of these organizations in conjunction
with the civilian naval con- ? .9
suiting board.
When the plans tentatively drawn
up by the president and his advisers
are completed machinery will be set
going which is expected to give the
government complete information regarding
business and industrial resources
which would have to be
called to the assistance of the army
and navy in time of war.
When the president addresses the
Railroad Business association banquet
in New York January 27 he is
expected to refer to the advisability
of having the railroads and concern
which manufacture railroad supplies
cooperate in the general mobilization
plans. The army war college already
has much data necessary for
proper movement of troops over railroads
in time of war.
George A. Post, president of the
Railroad Business association, has in- . rd
formed the president that this organ- .
ization is willing to cooperate. Other
associations of business and professional
men will be asked to help.
The organizations asked by the
president to appoint representatives
to aid in collection of mobilization
data are among those which nominated
members for the naval consulting
board, which has appointed a
committe to help in carrying out the
president's plan.
Fitted to Serve. ^
Secretary Daniels in a statement
tonight commenting on the navy's
part in the programme pointed out
that the five engineering organizations
represented a membership of
36,000 technical men, "particularly
fitted to perform this class of work
in an intelligent and disinterested
manner.
"The plan involves a board of five
engineers in each State of the Union,
one from each of the societies," said
Mr. Daniels. "Each one of these men
will become an associate member of
the naval consulting board, working
through the committe of the board.
"These five men in each State will
form the nucleus of an organization
in each State. They will be asked to
select members of their societies
from all parts of the State and will

the government and in this way
bring the officials in touch with the
railways so that not only will the government
know the volume and extent
to which these industries can render

the industries as to the requirement
of such service. It is proposed -to
place small orders for certain munitions
based on conditions existing at
the time. These orders will perhaps
bring no profit to the manufacturers,
but they will through such orders
have gauges on the shelves and at

and samples on hand. The
men in each plant will have a working
knowledge of government requirements.

is utilizing about 80 per cent, of its
ndustries in producing army and

government would need to do the
same thing and in order to turn the

to know where to turn to ob:ain
supplies and not only of muni:ions
but of everything needed for
;he arming, clothing, transportation,
sustenance and care of the men callid
to the colors."
