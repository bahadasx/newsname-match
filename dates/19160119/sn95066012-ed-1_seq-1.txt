NO FIRE THIS NOON
Can of Phosphorus Made Smudge at
High School Building.
A can of phosphorim trout which
the water had dried began to give off
smoke in the high school building this
noon and an alarm was rung in from
Box 1(5 by Chief Spear who was tak
ing no chances of any live sparks
Igniting the building again.
The phosphorus is ordinarily kept
in water to make it safe for handling
in the chemistry department. During
the inventory of the recent fire dam
age this jar of material became crack
ed and some of the phosphorus came
into contact with the shelf on which
it had been placed. The result was
a smudge without the building being
actually afire.
Chief Spear believed in "Safety
First," pulling the alarm in order to
have the nppuratus on the way if a
fire had broken out ugain. Then he
investigated the root of the smudge
and upon removing the jar found him
self a very effectual fire department.
A small space on the shelf was
scorched. The release signal was
sounded in a few minutes.
BUYS MORE FOREST LAND
State Has Acquired Another Tract on
Mount Mansfield.
Tho Vermont forestry department
has just concluded the purchase of a
tract of about 2,000 acres lying on the
east side of Mount Mansfield This
propel ty, added to the one acquired a
year ago on the west side of the range
makes tho total area about 5.000
acres. The Mansfield forest thus be
comes not only the largest state for
est in Vermont, but, next to the Craw
ford North forest in New Hampshire,
tlio largest in New England. It is tin
dcrstood that the state of New Hamp
shire paid 1100,000 for the Crawford
Notch property of (1,000 acres. Tho
Mansfield forest will cost Vermont
about $13,500. However, in the for
mer case the timber was included In
tho purchase, Whereas funds were not
available for the Vermont forestry
department to purchase tho merchant
able timber. A fairly ratlsfactorv ar
rangement has been made by the
state forester with the grantors
whereby they agree not to cut spruce
and fir trees which are less than 10
Inches In diameter; and hemlock and
hardwoods less than l.V miles all
trees to be measured at breast height,
On certain areas no cutting are to be
made and the time limit will make it
impossible to cut close. The legal ar
rangements for the -'purchase were
made by State's Attorney Maurice of
Lamoille county.
From a forestry standpoint tho pur
chase t,f this' largo area at a reason
able price, with a fairly good stand
of growing trees, makes this by f:ir
the finest area in the state. Markets
for lumber in Stowe and Underbill
lire bound to improve and there can
be no question but that the purchase
will prove a good investment to the
state In future years.
Governor Gates, who has been in
favor of this purchase since i: was
first called to his attention. Is particu
larly interested because of Its scenic
aspects. On the north the tract cros3
es the Smuggler's Notch road, which
the governor hopes to develop as one
of the chief attractions of tho state. ,
It is unsurpassed for beauty by any
thing in New England. Farther south
the Nebraska Notch crosses the state
forest. By a development of road-i
through these two notches a wonder
ful circuit would be thrown open to
the atitomobilist. State Forester
Hawos believes that the demonstra
tion of practical forestry principles in
a section which will be so widely visi
ted cannot fail to produce good re
sults throughout, the state.
In still another way this large state
forest will be beneficial. This Is in
the protetcion of the streams. Sever
al large brooks rise in this forest and
are important tributaries or the Win
ooski and Lamoille rivers. The water
falls in tho forest are numerous and
exceedingly picturesque.
It .should be mentioned that the
summit of Mount Mansfield is not
included in the purchase, since that
belongs to the University of Vermont
through a gift, dating back to 185!).
These purchases are made possible
through an appropriation made to the
forestry department by the legislature
ot 1912.

the most noted dramatic readers, and
It seems to be received everywhere
with high praise.

KEEPING A PIANO IN TUNE.
Use All the Keyo Every Time the In
strument Is Played.
The trained mnslcinn lias little trou
ble in keeping hLs piano in excellent
tune. Uut tho amateur pianist who
just plays little snatches of this and
that soon finds that some of the keys
are In much better tune than others.
Tho fault H not always that of the
piano tuner, nor is It always due to tho
fact that the piano has been exposed to
dampness or left in a strong draft of
air. Usually it is because the amateur
player doesn't uso every key when ho
plays. The musician who plays merely
for bis own benefit and who is far
from being a skilled pianist discovers
that lie plays belter in some one key.
and consequently ho selects ull hLs
music from that key. The true musi
cian plays nil keys and has no prefer
ence for uny particular one.
If for any length of time we play al
most entirely in olio key the note
which aro not used aro bound to pro
duce a dlffereut sound from those
which are used constantly.
The skilled musician runs his fingers
lightly over the whole keyboard before
starting any piece, thus bringing nil
the notes into action. But the clumsy
amateur usually starts without the
slightest pretense of a prelude or cull
ing forth tho different tones of the
piano. No piano can be expected to
keep long in perfect tune unless every
key is used about as much as every
other key. The well modulated Instru
ment is the one whoso notes all see
equal amounts of service.
The piano, like the voice, must be
evenly used to be perfect. Any one
who talks in a high pitched voice and
only culls forth the high tones of bis
throat cannot expect to talk in a low.
well modulated voice when bo never
uses the low. soft strains. A cheap
piano well taken care of will sound
better if played by a musician who
uses all the keys than a higher priced
one which is only allowed to produce
tho tones of the single key which tho
nmntcur player can. read best. New

STAMFORD LOOKS TO FUTURE
Citizens Elect a Committee to De
velop a Village Plan Bennington
County Association Co-operating
The North Adams Transcript of
January 14th has the following ar
ticle. Why should not a community plan
for the future? Many communities,
like many men, simply drift. Other
communities, like many other men,
steer. They have an ideal, a pur
pose, toward which they work. The
man who drifts winds up in Jail, or
the poor house or the gutter or at
least in poverty. The community,
which drifts winds up with deserted
farms, impassable roads, tumble
down houses, poor schools and gener
ul dilapidation. The man, who has a
great purpose in life, who shapes
everything toward that purpose
comes out prosperous, likewise the
community.
Today everyone recognizes the fact
that a matt must have a plan In life
if ho Is to succeed, but few realize
that their community must also have
a plan If It Is to succeed. Most com
munities simply drift. Roads aro
patched up anyway from year to year
with little thought of a constructive
plan. Schools are conducted with
only the thought of how the pupils
this year may be accommodated, with
no thought of five years in advance.
Officers are elected from mere caprice
or personal preference with little
thought of who is best qualified to
develop the community. Resources,
agricultural, mineral or industrial.
lie undeveloped, water power goes to
waste, when there aro people and
when there Is money to develop these
resources, simply because of a lack of
a community plan. People remove
from a town and no one comes In to
take their places, because no one
outside knows of the opportunities
and tesources.
But one town Is going to drift no
longer. Stamford has long been one
of Vermont's most progressive small
towns and now it is taking the lead
by appointing a committee to study
the community, its resources, possi
bilities, needs, and to develop a con
structive plan lor the future.
The committee is uiiofllcial and has
no power other than to suggest and
recommend. But Stamford people
co-operate,, they -work together. There
is a great .village rlde and it is pret
ty certain that everything recommend
ed by this committee will be brought
to pass. J
For u week tlio citizens have been
conducting a campaign in co-operation
with tho Bennington County As
sociation. Mass meetings have been
held every night, public spirit is at a
high pitch. Last night Secretary
Bartlett of the County Association,
gave an address on Co-operation in
which he urged a plan for tho future.
At the close of his address the mat
ter was discussed for over an hour,
many of the prominent citizens taking
part. Uikjii a motion from the floor
a committee of three citizens was
elected by direct primary ballot. 1
Those elected were R. J. Sanford, A.
J. Tanner and E. D. Bishop. These
men are to choose others as they may j
deem fit, making a committee of five j
or seven members. The whole!
community is back of them and tho
Bennington County Association is
co-operating. Willard W, Bartlett.
the Secretary of this Association is a I
specialist in community develop-:
meat and he will work with the
committee. It is his expectation
that many other communities in the
County will follow the lead of Stam
ford and that they will all help each
other in their parallel problems. -
We expect, however, that Stamford
will always be the leader, they do
things right in : that town. Better
keep your eyo on Stamford, that is
the kind of a town to live in, to woVk
in, to summer in, and to invest
money in.
FOR "PORK BARREL'! FIRST
Clark of Florida Against Defense if it
Stops Public Buildings.
Washington, Jan. 17. National de
fence and "pork barrel" legislation
were linked In a speech in the House
today by Representative Frank Clark
of Floiida, Chairman ot the Commit
tee on Public Buildings, who stated
that he favored a public buildings bill
at this session and was against pre
paredness, if it meant a stoppage of
internal improvements.
Mr. Clark attacked yellow news
paper and "saffron magazines," which
attacked appropriations for public
buildings, rivers and harbors and oth
er internal improvements:
"1 am in favor of reasonable pre-'
paredness." said Mr. Clark in dis
cussing the defense program, "but If '
preparedness means the stoppage of
all progress, then I am against pre-'
paredness tooth and nail, forever and
a day."
Mr. Clark advoucted the payment
of expenditures for preparedness by
a bond issue, and not out of current
revenues.

Latranehise and choirmaster, Edward
Ce! Prevost congratulated the choir!
master and members of the choirvon
their successful services of the past
year, praised the work of tho ushers

PROFITABLE CROP ROTATION.
!
Central Aim Should Be to Leave Fields !
In a Better Condition
The most profitable crop rotation does
not consist merely in changing the
crops around from year to year regard
less of the relation of the crops to each,
other. The central aim in ull crop ro
tation systems should be to leave each j
field in a better state of cultivation.
better physical condition and reason
ably free from pests at the end of each
rotation cycle.
No hard und fust rotation system can
be laid down for any community, but
the most profitable system must bo
worked out for each farm and Indeed
for each field. There are certain gen
eral principles, however, that should da
borne in uiiud In this connection in or- 1
der to accomplish the most satlsfac- !
lory results. For soil Improvement ;
there should be at least one leguminous 1
crop In each rotation cycle. To this
clnss of plants belong the clovers, al
falfa, pens, beans, etc. There should
be also :i s-ufiiciont quantity of live
stock, especially milk cows, on each
farm to utilize the roughage and to
supply the desired quantity of, stable
manure, which In addition to groeu
crops plowed under will furnish tin

i Motor Csr Makes Remarkable Record
in Its First Season.
In speaking of the Dodge Motor
Car. E. W. Williams of tho Benning
ton Garage says "This car has mado
'an tmeqiuled record for giving' it6
Owners perfect service. Twelve
Dodga Touring oars were sold this
season in this vicinity. At the end 'of
the season not one of these twelve
I' cars had broken down or given out
They have not required the replace
ment or repair of any parts, of the
mechanism, and all of them are in
i condition for next season's work with
' cut any thorough overhauling. They
' have made a greater mileage on gaso
, line than any cur of their size and
, horsepower that we have ever known.
Their record for tire economy might
, "be envied by many smaller and light
" er car3. Tiro economy on The Dodgo
' Cars is much increased by tho special
self lubricating springs which give
'the cad its beautiful riding qualities
assisted by the genuine grain leather
Turkish Upholstering which is so
good that it does not suffer by com
parison with that in two thousand dol

of which the higher priced cars aro
this year bragging. Dodge Cars that
have been used an entire season will
be found to have a luster on tho fin
ish equal to that on most, cars a fow
weeks out of the factory.
The Dodge Car ha3 made the same
record all over the country. Whilo
the number of cars being manufactur
ed by Dodge. Brothers is second only
to the output of The Ford Motor Com
pany they have never been ablo to
catch up with orders since they an
nounced tiio car a little over a year
ago.
No car selling nt near the Dodge

anywhere near tho value in power,
