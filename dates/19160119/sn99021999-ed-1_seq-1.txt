The two bodies later were taken to the

as to the identity of the man executed
as Rodriguez.
Baca-Valles, who was known as Vllla'a
most callous executioner at Juarez, was
taken from the box car in which he ar
rived a few minutes before 5 o'clock. He
was marched through the dimly lighted
platform, of tho railway station, where
many families spend their nights. Execu

POLITICAL IMPORTANCE OF MOVE
LINCOLN, Jan. is. (Special.)
John Lee Webster, president of the
Nebraska Historical society, dcliv-
ercd his annual address to the body
tonight. Mr. Webster dealt with
the admission of Nebraska Into the
union, Boing greatly into detail as
to the discussion in the senate of the
United States of the enabling act.
The proceedings in the United
States henate form one of the most
interesting chapters of the records
of that body, especially as Nebraska
was the first state to be admitted
after the close of the war of the
rebellion, nt a time when there was n
serious controversy between t lie con res
and President Johnson, and n consider
able division anions; republicans 1n con
Rrcss a to the policy that should bo pur
sued. The high places In this dchnte
were brought out by Mi. Webster, who
quoted liberally from the speeches of
Benjamin F. Wnde, John Sherman and
Samuel .1. Kirk wood, who warmly cham
pioned tho admission of Ncbrnkn, and
from Charles Sumner and Senator 111
munds, who opposed the uchnhslnn. It
nag romethlna; of a struggle between the
cast and the west, the older states see
ing In the admission of the new ones the
taking away of a control they then
wielded. It was finally argued to them
that the republicans would need tho
votes of the new states to pass th civil
rights amendments and other of tho re
construction measures in which they were,
interested.
The address vividly recalled a. chapter
of history with which the present genera
tion Is unfamiliar, telling how President
Johnaon twice Interposed his veto against
the admission of Nebraska, and how the
bill was finally passed over his objec
tions. The debate In the senate was of
especial importance, as giving a light on
tho line of thought that then prevailed,
and showing something of the political
Importance of the new state.
Lippitt Would Send
Army Into Mexico
To Catch Bandits
WASHINGTON. Jan. 18,-Senator Lip
pitt Introduced a resolution In the senate
this afternoon directing the president to
employ armed forces Immediately to pro
tect the lives of Americans In Mexico.
He said he was prompted to offer it be
cause he. .had read a storv that the United
States would aeek an agreement with the
South and Central American countries
heretofore consulted before taking any
radical steps.
The same story, he said, bad been de
nied In official circles earlier In the day.
and when Mr. Ltppltt asked how long
it would take the United States to get
tho permission of Argentine, Brazil,
Chile, Uruguay, Bolivia and Guatemala
to protect the lives of its citizens In
Mexico, the chairman of the foreign re
lations committee retorted the question
did not deserve an answer.
'American lives are being destroyed In
Mexico daily.-1 Senator Llppitt said. "If
I had been president last week when the
report of the killing of American citizens
reached Washington another sun would
not have set on the Sierra Mamre moun
tains before American soldiers would be
hot on the trail of the murderers. Such
a doctrine would meet a responsive note
In the hearts of the American pvioplc.."
'It may be," said Senator Stone, "that
few senators on the republican side are
really thirsting for war in Mexico, but
I do not believe that Is tho sentiment of
the sensible, conservative and patriotic
senators of the minority. The president
would be sjubject to Impeachment if he
ordered an Invasion of Mexico without
the authority of congress."
The resolutions were finally referred to
the foreign relations committee and the
Mexican debate gave way to the Philip
pine bill.
Newly Discovered
Serum Hastens the
Healing of Wounds
PARIS, Jan. 18. Dr. Pierre Roux, di
rector of the Pasteur institute, announced
to the Academy of Science last night that
a remarkable advance in serumtherapy
bad been made as the result of a dis
covery by Dr. Bassuet of a method of
cleaning automatically wounds that had
resisted treatment.
Dr. Bassuet employes - the polyvalent
serum discovered last year by Drs. Lec
lalnche and Valle. Dr. Roux said 420
wounded men who had been In hospitals
from six to fourteen months were treated
by Dr. Bassuet's method. As a result
the infection seemed to revive. Abcesaes
formed and burst spontaneously, elimi
nating bite of hone, splinters, bullets,
pieces of clothing and even drains and
silver tin cads left in the incisions by
mistake.
After this had happened. Dr. Roux said,
the wounds healed quickly in most rases
and men who had been lying helpless
for months were discharged cured.

BERLIN, Jan. 18. (By Wireless to
Sayville.) A denial that Captain Franz
Von Papen, recalled German military
attache at Washington, paid money to
individuals in tho United States in con
nection with attempts to blow up muni
tions factories or bridges, was made
today by the semi-official Overseas News
agency. The news agency statement
follows:
"British press reports state that the
former Germun military attache at
Washington, Captain Von Papen, had In
his possession letters and bank notes,
seized by the British at Falmouth,
which contain evidence thst he paid
money to persons connected with ex
plosions in munitions factories in the

Tho Overseas News agency hears from
competent authorities that these asser
tions are not correct.
"Captain Vou Papen's letters and bsnk
books, which were seized in violation of
the safe conduct guaranteed to him, ore
fo a purely personal character or have to
do with usual business affairs. Cap
tain Von Papen never paid money to
persons connected with attempts or al
leged attempts against munition plants,

erty. No check was ever paid to
Werner Horn, who Is accused of an at

ADVANCE DOPE ON
HARM0NY MEETING
Republican Clans Getting; Ready to
Respond to the Call to Go
to Lincoln.
SEVERAL WOULD BE DELEGATE
Unless signs fail, quite a delega
tion of Omaha republicans will move
on Lincoln today to attend the
state-wide mass meeting, to bo held
there for the purpose of recommend
ing a Bet of harmony candidates tor
delegates to the national convention
ia Chicago In June, subject to the
pr'maries In April.
It is not certain, however, it will
all be harmony with a big li. at the
meeting, for the prospects now are
that the bunch from pduglas county
may-be disagreed on their preferred
candidates for delegates.
Started In Omaha.
It Is understood that the Lincoln har
mony meeting took Its Inception from
little gathering here in Omaha last De
cember, at which the Idea was put out,
that by dividing tho four delegates-at-large
equally between representatives of
the regulars and of the progressive ele
ment, everything would be made ac
ceptable to everybody. The names that
came out of this meeting were those of
the two 1912 stato chairman, Currle and
Kpperson, with (Jurdon W. Wattles to be
added from Omaha and a progressive
to bo chosen from Lincoln, b'or this
fourth place, two names have been men
tioned, ex-Mayor love, and now Ned
Brown.
To -start the ball a rolling, petitions
were prepared setting forth the desires
for harmony In the form of a call for
a mass meetolng at Lincoln on the nine
teenth. These petitions wore circulated
and signed up In different parts of the
state, not making their appearance hero
In Omaha until last week, but in the
past two or three days have been iiullu
freely in evidence and many signatures
have been attached. In addition to this,
the MoKlnley club has been active In
inviting its members to go to Lincoln,
sending out letters over the name of the
president. Harry 8. Byrne, to all of the
names on its list. In the Interval, it Is
said, that another element of the party
not particularly friendly to Mr. Wattles
have also been conferring witu a view to
sending a delegation and proposing other
names, though just whose has not been
dlsdoved.
To Recommend Delegates.
All the talk at the beginning was to the
effect that the harmony plan concerned
Itself only with delegates-at-iarge, but
it Is now Intimated that if conilll Ions are
ripe, an attempt will he made to recom
mend district delegates for tho several
districts, the meeting being split up Into
sections so that thoso present from each
of the six congressional districts would
propose the names of two candidates for
delegates and hitch the whole list Into
one ticket for a complete delegation of
sixteen to go to Chicago, always with
the "If that they receive the necessary
votes in the April primary.
The delegates "recoiiiiiii'iuleil" ate all
expected to aland subject to whatever
preference choice may be exprefsed for
prertiiUnt and vice president. The mam
meeting, howevtr, Is to be addressed by
special invitation, by Henry l. Kla

active presidential campaigner In Ne
braska, and nllhoush not announced, the
presumption Is that ex-Kenutor HurKett.
who has Just put up bis lightning roil for
vice president, will alsa utilize ttio oc
casion to present his i luliim to the as
