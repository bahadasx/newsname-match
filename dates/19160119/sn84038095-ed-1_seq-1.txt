Note: Until May 8, 1915, the county
road cash fund was constituted by
transferring the one mill county road
fund, the two mill county road build
ing fund and the motor vehicle fund
to what was called the county road
cash fund, although there never was
and is not now a levy made for the
ccunty road cash fund, the transfers
being made merely to simplify records,
accounts, etc.
Since Mav 8. 1915, the county road
cash fund has been constituted as be
fore with the exception that the motor
vehicle road fund has been kept sep
arate as provided by law to be used
only in paying for the construction of
permanent culverts or for the crown
ing, dragging, draining or graveling
of public highways outside the limits
of cities or incorporated towns.
Ninety per cent of the money paid
to the secretary of state for registra
tion of automobiles is apportioned to
the counties of the state in proportion
to the number of civil townships in
the counties, 5 per cent goes to the
state hjghway commission for its main
tenance, and it is the writer's opinion,
though not definitely slated in the
statute, that the remaining 5 per cent
is used by the secretary of state to
cover cost, of number plates and office
work in connection therewith.
Apportionments are mado by the
auditor of state to the county treasur
ers in April and August of each year.
On April 5, 1915, this county received
$8,862.00 which was transferred to tho
county road cash fund, with which
fund 51 reinforced concrete box cul
verts were built at a cost of $11,933.75
and 50 temporary culverts were built
at a cost of $4104.89, making a total
of $16,038.34 worth of culvert work
classed as road work and paid by
county'r6aa"caSH fund, into whieh $8,
862.00 of motor vehicle fund "was trans
ferred.

In other words, it may, be said
that our first 1915 draw of $8,862.00
from automobile registration was used
in building permanent concrete box
culverts.

DISTRICT COURT
NEXT MONDAY
Large Number of Cases on Calendar,
and All Cannot Be Disposed of
at This Term of Court.
INTERESTING CASE COMING UP
Heirs of Mr. and Mrs. August Meyer,
Killed in Wreck, Sue to Determine
Which of Parents Died First
District court is to conyene on next
Monday, Judge Albert coming here
from Sac City, where- lie closes the
January term for that county this
week.
The court will find a large number
of cases on the calendar for atrial when
court convenes on Monday and it is
not to be presumed that all of the
cases for trial will be- disposed of at
this coming term. Recently a number
of cases have been started which, in
fairness to the litigants, should be
tried at the coming term of court, but
which may Bte delayed on account of
older cases on the calendar to be tried
or otherwise settled. It is to be hoped
the cases growing out of the oollanse
of the Wright and Kinney building
will be reached for trial at this term,
but that is problematical.
A new case was started recently
against tho opera house company,
growing out of an accident where a
party came in contact with a fire
escape and was injured.
Another case grows out of a man
being thrown from a motorcycle on the
highway between Denison and Schles
wig almost two years ago.
A rather interesting case is that in
which the heirs of August Meyer and
wife are concerned. August Meyer
and his wife, about three years ago,
were killed in a wreck on the Unioij
Pacific railroad not far frotif Gothen
burg, Neb. They were both killed in
the pame wreck but the question has
never been determined which survived
the other. It was not thought of any
consequence in the start to develop
the fact, but recently tho interests of
the children have ra-omptert some of
them at least to investigate the ques
tion of whether the husband or the
wife died first.
,There are just fifty women's coats. All sizes 16 to 40. The en

that the mother lived for a short time
at least after their father was dead.
This may prove an interesting case as
long as property rights depend upon
the question of which one died first and
it will be worth while t0 follow the
case in order to see how the facts turn
cut and the legal construction which
will be put upon the lacts when ascer
tained.

August Meyer left a will arid some
of the children thought they had been
unfairly discriminated against in the
distribution of the'property and in
stituted a contest against the probate
of the will. These contestants have
concluded that if they are able to show
that their mother survived their father
for any length of time'tliat it would
make a difference in their share of the
property, and a suit has been institut
ed in which it is proposed to show
These instructors are special teach

DENISON LOSES
DOAL DEBATE
Debate Between Denison and Carroll
High Schools Proves Disastrous
for Denison in Both Events
TRIANGLE DEBATE NEXT MONTH
Notwithstanding Denison's Loss, Local
Debaters Deserve Much Credit
in Handling Their Subjects
The dual debate between the high
school teams of Carroll and Denison
on last Friday evening resulted in de
cisions by tiir- judges for the negative
team from .Carroll, which debated in
Denison. and the affirmative team of
tho, Carroll high school, debating in
their own city. The debate at Carroll
was held for the purpose of deters
mining which team will be admitted to
the state debating contest to be held
in the near future, two at least of the
members of the Carroll team having
had the advantage of appearing on
state teams in former debates.
Owing to the failure ofdtwo of the
judges of the evening to make proper
train connections in the afternoon, the
opening of the debate in Denison was
delayed until alrnpst 9:80. A miscel
laneous program hastily arranged af
ter 6:30 on that evening was carried
cut and was heartily enjoyed by the
audience who gathered early to hear
the debate. Just preceding the open
ing of the discussions, a double quar
tet of the high school beautifully ren
dered "Tl»r Rosary" and was heartily
encored, responding with the selec
tion, "The Firefly."
The team of debaters which went
clown to Carroll to discuss the negative
side of the question included Alfred
Paul, John Norris and Harold Poole,
with Margaret Pearson as alternate,
while the team remaining at home was
made up of Miss Vera Poole, Roy Geb
f-rt and William McHenry, with Miss
Margaret Zoren as alternate. The
judges invited to render the decision
in Denison were, Superintendent Glaz
ier, of Ida Grove Superintendent Vor
ist, of Odebolt, and Superintendent
Stokes, of Scranton.
The question, "Resolved, that the
several states should adopt a schedule
of minimum wage for unskilled labor,
constitutionality granted,'' afforded an
abundance, of iniere&ting .arguments,
though involving many problems of
study and thought for solution. The
Carroll team, made up of three young
ladies, excelled our home team in the
manner in which they.had committeed
their arguments and especially their
rebuttal speeches. They were most

s»p^^^w«fsrc
W
they uttered to be the only way of de
ciding the question under discussion,
it is still believed that the' arguments
of the affirmative team from Denison
were the stronger and that the debate
could be won if those taking part were
eiven a short time longer to thorough
ly enter into the spirit of the argu
ment, memorizing the rebuttal speech
es more entirely. The Denison speak
ers were quite at home upon the plat
form. and did well, however, in the
estimation of everyone present.
The coaches for the Denison teams,
Misses Fannie Hayes and Faye Cham
berlin, as well as the members of the
teams, deserve much credit for the
creditable manner in which the argu
ments were arranged and presented.
The triangula^debate between teams
from Missouri Valley, Woodbine and
Denison will be held within the next
month and are looked forward to with
interest. Denison holds the silver cup
awarded to the winning team last year
and it is hoped that it may be retained
for another year.
MANY WITNESS BOXING MATCH
Fast Work of Ben Nicholson and
"Cyclone" Sullivan in Boxing Ex
hibition at Saggau Hall
The young men of Denison enjoyed
a sparring match at the Saggau hall
on Monday evening of this week, when
Bennie Nicholson met Roger "Cy
clone" Sullivan in a six round bout.
As a curtain raiser there was a
wrestling match between Billy Wear
mouth and Art Williams, which re
sulted in a victory for Wearmouth,
who secured the first fall in 8 minutes
and the second in 2 minutes.
The boxing bout was one of the best
ever witnessed in Denison and both
of the young men displayed much tal
ent with the gloves. Sullivan is a
whirlwind on his feet, but did not
prove too much for Nicholson, who
kept his opponent guessing from start
to finish. The rounds were of two min
utes each with a rest of two minutes,
and at no time did they exhibit any
temper. No decision was rendered at
the close of the match and those who
witnessed it stated that it would be a
hard matter to say which one of the
boys put up the best exhibition.
The high school basketball team has
two games scheduled for this week.
The first game will be played at Perry
on Friday evening with the high school
team of that place and on Saturday
evening they" will" play the Missouri
Valley team at Denison. Oscar
Strahan, who graduated from the Dei
son high school, is coach at Perry this
year and the Denison boys expectthat
a great effort will be made to defeat
them. Missouri Valley has an excep-
convincing in their delivery and ap- tionally strong team thfe year and this
peaAd to .believe every conclusion promises to be a very fast game.

TEST MADE OF
NEW WELL SUPPLY
Engineer Woolston Makes Test of Wa
ter Supply From Deep Well and
Findjs Well Must Be Deeper
DESIRES 200 GALLONS PER MIN.
Water Is of Purest Character, But
Samples Will Be Sent to Iowa
City for Analysis.
A test of the deep well which is be
ing drilled just west of the new munic
ipal light plant was made yesterday af
ternoon by City Engineer Frank Wool
ston, together with the men who are
engaged in doing the drilling, and af
ter an exhaustive test had been made
it was decided that there was not
enough water flowing into the well to
take care of Denison's needs. Al
though there was over 900 feet of wa
ter in the well after a few minutes'
pumping this was diminished to such
an extent that it was evident that
there was not an abundant supply of
water. Water was pumped out at the
rate of 100 gallons per minute and in
15 minutes of pumping the water was
lowered a little over 15 feet. Mr.
Woolston states that the new well
must be sunk to a depth which will
insure a supply of water so that when
the pumps are working 200 gallons
can be pumped each minute without
lowering the water to any great ex
tent. A well with a capacity of 200
gallons per minute would furnish ev
ery man. woman and child in Denison
with 100 gallons of water each day. Ac
cording to statistics" the average con
sumption of water is figured at 200
gallons for every inhabitant. At a
glance this would seem out of reason,
but when one stops to consider that
water is used in boilers, for water
motors, toilets and for sprinkling
lawns, it is not surprising that this
much water is used.
The water in the new well seems to
be of the purest character and samples
of it taken around to the business men
was said to be equal to the present wa
ter. It is clear and sparkling without
the slightest odor and does not have
the mineral taste that is so common
with water obtained from deep wells.
Down at Dunlap where they sunk a
deep well the water has a pronounced
mineral taste'.to it and has caused con
siderable dissatisfaction. Mr. Wool
ston received containers yesterday
from the State university and samples
will be sent today to the university
laboratory, where it will be tested as
to its purity. As soon as it is evident
that there is a sufficient supply of wa
ter to take care of Denison's needs
work will be stopped on the well
