Wanted,?City Builders
Athens in the age of pericles
developed in many respects the
most wonderful city that has so
far existed in the world.
This was done because the
task of making a great city was
placed before that of individual
money getting. All the citizens
were often called to take part in
discussing the problems of the
city. Good citv government is
one of the greatest powers for
righteousness at the disposal of
men. Every town ought to
have a good city charter. There
ought to be a copy of it in every
home, it ought to be a text book
in every school in the town.
Every citizen ought to know
what are the duties and responsibilities
of the private citizen,
ought to know what are the duties
and responsibilities of the
town officials. The town itself
ought to be as well managed as
its schools or any private busi
ness in it.
Every town ought to have a
board or committee to look after
the health and sanitation, another
to look after or take steps
to provide a park and a playground,
another to look after the
amusement, recreation and edu
cation of the people who are not
in active touch with the public
schools, and to provide some
form of social center that is de
signed to be more uplifting tnan
the saloons. It is just as important
to stamp out a moral poison
as it is to stamp out the contagion
of smallpox. It is just as
important to quarantine against
.. gambling as. it is against scarlet
IPPHPtfTo,- be satisfied - withthings
as tjiey are is' often the
worst land of sin. If the people
of our town could see clearly
what our town is now, and put
' that in contrail with the town it
would be if all our citizens
would unite in making it the
town it ought to be and might
become, they would weep over
it as lesus did over Jerusalem.

There is coming to our town
a Booster Chautauqua in the
near future that will furnish us
an opportunity to begin to do
some of these great things for
our town. The first is to get together
and make it a great success.
We can do this by a

United and enthusiastic effort.
We can discover men and women

Four Men Are Killed in Explosion
in Submarine
New York, Jan. 15.?Four
raen were killed and 10 others
injured, five of them dangerously,
in an explosion which'occurred
this afternoon on the submarine
E-2, while the craft was
undergoing repairs in dry dock
at the New York Navy Yard.
One of the men killed was an
enlisted electrician and the other
three civilian workers. At least
three of the 10 now in the hos
pitals are not expected to live.
a f ? .?
svunougn ine detonation was
terrific, the submarine itself,
from the outside, shows none ol
the effects of the explosion, the
second fatal^accident of its kind
in the history of the United
States Navy. The interior apparatus
was badly shettered but sg
tight was the vessel's shell thai
there was no means of escape
for gas which accumulated and
it was more than an hour aftei
the blast before the work of re
covering the bodies could be
completen. A ladder was blown
up through the ceiling and fell
150 feet away.
The injured men and one
body were removed soon aftei
the accident but three bodies fai
down in the craft could not be
reached until the gas had beer
blown out by compressed air
Soon after the explosion severa
naval officers lead a rescue par
ty into the dry dock but were
partly overcome by gas fumes
when they attempted to descent
into the vessel. It was then thai
compressed air pipes were run
into the shell and the gas forced
out.

About 20 were working on the

that any one who was inside
could have escaped injury.
What caused the explosion
has not been definitely decided.

and refusing to come down.
With the same suddeness that
he disappeared last week, Mr.

reappeared in Chesterfield.
When tcld that many reasons,
dark and foul, had been assigned
for his sudden leave taking,
Mr. Abbott smiled and replied:
"I^et dogs delight

Mr. Abbott has been to Union,

The Purest Air We Breathe

The Diirost air wp Rro-.iiho
( night air. Actual tests have
proved again and again that the
, bacteria count in the night air is
much lower titan that in the air
during daylight hours when the
activities of the world are at full
height and the maximum of
dirt is active. Yet, despite this
demonstrated scientific fact, so
deeply rooted is the fear of the
"cold, damp night air" that
thousands are fearful of letting
it into their sleeping rooms dur
ing the winter months. Of
course, during the summer
weather the question regulates
itself, but during the winter the
hoodoo of the night air stalks
triumphantly. It would be amusing.
if it wert* nnt c?.?rir\nc

how this nightair notion has got
deeply into the convictions of
people, and how difficult it is to
remove it. Instead of throwing
down a window and letting in
the pure wintry air. thousands
sleep in closed window rooms
and breathe over and over the
vitiated air, rendered disease-,
breeding by the waste of their
own bodies. It is little wopder
that we have so many "colds"!?

1 Didn't Know What Guano Is.
I Monroe Enauirer.
i Guano is such an important
i item in farming in this section,
that one would hardly think
that in the great farming state of
Kansas it is not only not used,
; but in some sections there are
some people in ignorance as to
, what fertilizer is. Mr. Clinton
Williams, who worked at Well
ington, Kans., two years ago,
relates >he following incident in
reference to the ignorance of
some people out in that section
on the merits of guano:
"We were busy unloading a
string of cars one night when a
couple of helpers came to four
bulky, suspicious looking sacks.
There was a great divergence
of opinion as to what the sucks
contained. One fellow, who
had the job of carrying it into
the freight shed, exclaimed gh!
There's something dead in .his
here sack.'
"I was so confounded m d
r amused at their ignorance of
what is a farming necessity in
this part of the country that I
reared back and roared.
"When I enlightened them as
Jito the contents of the sack, they
were very curious as to its ingredients
that they all gathered
fcround the sack and made a
very minute examination of its
contents,"

the kind to make Pageland's
chautauqua a great success.
The chautauqua will last three
days, and there will be three attractions
each day, one in the
forenoon, one in the afternoon
and one at night. One day will

Former Dictator of Mexico Dead
El Paso, Jan. 13.?Victoriano
Huerta, former dictator of Mexico,
died here tonight.
Gen. Huerta died at his home
nt S-Fta oVInrlr
Gen. Huerta, who succeeded
Gen. Francisco I. Madero in
executive power in Mexico City
and later left Mexico, died of
sclerosis of the liver. He was
surrounded by his family when
the end came. His death was
not unexpected. Funeral arrangements
are to be made to
morrow. It is believed an effort
will be made to arrange for
his burial in Mexico.
Victoriana Huerta was born
in 1857 of aristocratic parentage.
In 1857 he entered the government
military college at Chapultepec.
At this institution he
spent four years, and after his
graduation in 1879 at once joined
a coast regiment. From this
year till 1891 but little is known
of his life, which was spent in
routine military service, in which
he had attained the rank lieutenant
colonel and the command
of a military station in the inferior
of the country. In this
post he became conspicuous for
ins success in puuing aown ine
brigands who at this time infested
the country. His work
came to the attention of President
Diaz, who called him to
Mexico City. On his arrival, it
is said, Diaz offered him whatever
post in the war department
was most to his liking

Liquor and Blockaders
Monroe Enquirer.
Although the law allows only
one quart of liquor to be shipped
to a person every fifteen days,
it is generally known that some
? f -t.
ui me people ot Monroe and
vicinity found various means to
evade the law. One of the
favorite means of evasion was
to have a quart shipped to various
places out side ol Monroe?
say one to Wingate, one to
Marshville and one to Waxliaw
?which would give one four
quarts. The first cost of the
liquor and express added to the
livery hire in collecting the shipments
from the above named
places, hits the boozers' pockets
pretty hard. Another favorite
manner for evading the law was
to take the train for Virginia
and bring back well-filled crins
i-? - - r- ? A
few persons were caught at
this game.
The Sanford Express relates
an ingenious way the blockaders
of that section have adopted for
carrying on their work without
interruption. Thev erect something
like four or five stills at a
time and bury or in some way
conceal them all but one, which
is put in operation. If this still
is captured by the officers, the
hlfkrlra^aro 1
wiwauuvid mil ui lu^ uui another
one and often start up
near where the first one was
captured, thinking that the officers
will not return to that locality
any time soon. Everytime
a still is destroyed another
one is brought out to take its
place. Were hlockaders and
blind tigers to stick to some
'Aitifcitinrcrte business with the
same tenacity the display in the',
making and selling of liquor,
they would make a howling success.
We are told that one Union
county moonshiner operates his
still at night and sinks it in the
nearby creek during the day.
Others have adopted various
shemes to avoid detection.
He Did Not Run.
Lumberton Robcrsonian.
>4He is not of the running
kind," was the remark one of
the promoters made about a certain
young man from the country
this morning. However, there
seems to have ix-en some tall
running done last night. The
way it happened:
Some of the bovs about town
decided to have a little race
from the young man from the
country. Some of the boys,
quite a number of them, went to
the park about a mile from town
and hid themselves, while another
of the "gang" fooled the
young man from the country up
to that particular place. When
the hidden bunch dashed for the
young man from the country he
said "No, I'll not run," but instead
he pulled out a knife not
more than a quarter of an inch
shorter than the law limit for a
knife. He threw his arm around
the neck of one of the bunch
and the others thought that hewas
being cut to pieces by the
man who it was supposed,
would run for his life. However,
he was not knifed, but did
some pitiful begging, it is said.
The other boys ran in different
directions, some of them getting
scratched considerably by briars.
The young man came back to
town after all the other hovs had
run the race and took his auto
and went back to hunt for the
one who had accompanied him
to the park.
The boys have had a fewgood
races out of newcomers in
this way, but last nighi the outf
