i nexpectedly in London to Review
Situation
l.nNDON, Jan. 19.-- The war
council of the allies met unexpected
ly today. The air was full of ru
mors of Important developments In
the Halkans. Before the session be
gan, an official statement discredited
the report the allies had sent an ul
timatum to Greece demanding tho
immediate withdrawal of the diplo
mats of the central powers Simul
taneously Rotterdam reported a rev
olutionary movement afoot In Greece
to establish a republic. It was ru
mored Venlzelos would head the new
regime King fonsiantlne was said
to bo in danger of being deposed
shortly.
Several sources sent reports of va
rious landings of allied forces in
Greece, with stories Indicating the
poMslhllltv of an attack by the Teu
tons in Sul.ulkl about to begin.
The first intimation that the war
council had been called was the ar
rival of Premier Hrland of France.
The session Indicated matters ol
the greatest political and military im
portance were to be discussed, partic
ularly because there has been no ses
sion since December, when It was de
cided to continue the Balkan sanV
palgn and land troops at Salonlki
The Athena censor has not paused

is regarded as ominous In view of re

Wate. ts Six Feet on Monday But so Far no Damage Has Been
Reported-Jam Above City May go Out First, in Which Case Situa
tion Would be Serious.
Because of an Ice Jam in the I'olum
bia between Cmatllla and Irrtgon the
water in the river rose six feet on
Monday and though no damage was
inflicted the situation caused uneasi
ness and speculation as to what the
future held in store.
The alarming feature of the situ,
atlon is the fact there is another Jam
in the river a short distance above
t'matilla, probably at the rapids. In
the event this Jam should give way
first and thus let the water through
swiftly while the lower Jam held fast
there would lie danger of a very swift
rise In the river with some damage
inevitable.
PRISONER ARGUES OWN
CASE BEFORE THE JURY
For the first time in vears that a
Prisoner has asserted his privilege of
addressing the jury In his own behalf,
("harlei Duke, Italian contractor
charged with obtaining money under
false pretenses. Just before noon to
day made u personal plea. He had
previously testified that he had stud
ted three years for the priesthoodand
he spoke to the Jurors with much
earnestness. The case went to the
Jury at 1:45 this afternoon and at 2:15
a verdict of guilty with a recommen
dation for mercy was returned.
The state put iu evidence this mor.
ning six different no-fund checks
which the defendant had issued last
September. It was the contention of
the district attorney that, at the lima
of issuing these checks, he knew he
had not money enough in the bank
to care for them and evidence to this
effect waa introduced. Moreover,
one witness testified that Duke sold
bis concrete equipment on the day be
fore he left Pendleton for Portland
and San Francisco.
Dak- while not denying having
written the checks, declared he had
no intention of defrauding anyone. In
his statement to the Jury he declared
that had he been wanting to cheat
anyone, he would have left when he
was owing several hundreds of dol
lars. He offered to make good the
checks if he were liberated. His at
ti rney. W. M. Peterson, pleaded with
the jury to give the young man an
other chance, declaring he had been
drinking heavily when the checks
were written and had no intention of
cheating anyone.
Duke was arrested in San Francis
co where he is said to have gotten In
to similar trouble and was brought
back here by Sheriff Taylor early last
December.
