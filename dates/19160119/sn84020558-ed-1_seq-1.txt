struck hard today at the pursuit of a
large section of the population of Juar
ez who have been gathering rags by tho
ton in the public streets of the Mexican
town and selling them to junk dealers
here. Ten tons of unclean rags have
been burned by I'nited States officials
tnd three Mexicans were arrested lam
today while trying to smuggle more
into the city. Ir. Tappan suggested
that the municipal authorities proceed
also against the junk dealers who pur
chase the rags. In order not to tolallv
destroy the rag gathering industry of
Juarez, I r. Tappan suggested that the
rags be fumigated and boiled, but ihe
liiantity was so great that the water
supply was exhausted long before the
visible supply had reached the tubs.
-Mexican authorities announced today
their willingness to co-operate with
American officials to prevent the en
trance of typhus fever into the I'nited
States, but they presented a problem
when they demanded to know what thev
should do with tile servant girls of F.l
Paso, about half of whom live in Juarez
and with the race track employes, who
pass back and forth daily. They sug
gested that if a general regime of kero
sene baths were instituted, the daily
passengers could not be exempted
with safety.
Extra immigration guards have been
placed on duty at the international
bridge to scrutinize all applicants for
entry.
