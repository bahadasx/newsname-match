KING'S STAND
Newspapers of the Country
Clamoring Over Utterance

ARE BITTER AT BRITISH
Numerous Mistreatments at
Hands of Great Britain
Are Reviewed.
London, Jan. 19. The Politiken of
Copenhagen, as quoted by the Ex
change Telegraph correspondent there,
says that anxiety has been aroused in
Stockholm by the speech at the open
ing of the Swedish parliament by King
Gustave, who urged vigorous prepara
tion of national defenses in view of the
disregard of the belligerents of neu
tral rights. The speech is a subject of
concern in Stockholm the correspond
ent says because of the seizure by the
British authorities last week of a large
quantity of provisions from the Swedish-American
steamship Stockholm
from New York to Stockholm. The ac
tion of the British authorities Is criti
cised sharply by the Swedish press,
which expresses the opinion that the
value of the goods seized cannot be
regarded as anything like an adequate
offset to the effect of the incident on
relations between Sweden and Great
Britain. Some of the Swedish news
papers state that such actions are
worse than an open rupture.
Hjalmar Branting, socialist leader
in the second Swedish chamber, who
recently visited the allied front in
Flanders, is quoted by the Social Dem
okraten as saying that he prefers de
cisive action a day too early rather
than a day too late, in order to save
Sweden from complications.
"It is noted that King Gustave, in
his speech from the throne, did not
make the usual reference to the good
relations of Sweden with foreign pow
ers," the correspondent adds. "Several
interpellations on foreign affairs are I and with a field marshal's baton and

PREPAREDNESSTO
8E WILSON FIGHT
Washington, Jan. 19. President Wil -
son today is planning to take personal
charge of the fight for national pre
paredness.
In addition to making a personal
appeal before the country in numerous
addresses in support of his program
for strengthening the army and navy,
the president plans to hold further
conferences on the subject with the
leaders in congress.
Numerous reports which have come
to the president of confusion over the
issue in congress and uncertainty of
the outcome prompted the step.
The president is said to be undeter
red by the open opposition of the paci
ficists, including William J. Bryan, and
differences among advocates of na
tional defense over the exact plans to
be adopted. He Is said also to be con
vinced that the preparedness program
is the best which can be offered at
this time.
Plans for the speaking trips were
going forward rapidly today.

Washington, Jan. 19. Increase in

Washington, Jan. 19. A story of
eight Japanese fishermen who drifted
across" the Pacific ocean in a small
fishing boat, landed on the British
Columbia shore after 24 days of hard
ship, reached the bureau of naviga

California cities which have been iso
lated by the floods were facing a short
age of food, but it was expected that
the difficulty would be overcome with
out serious suffering.

WAR LEECHES
STRUCK BLOW
BY CUMMINS
Senator From Iowa Urges
Government Manufacture
of All Munitions.
FIGHT AS LAST RESORT
Country Should Not Enter
Conflict Unless No Other
Thing to Do.
Washington, Jan. 19. Elimination
of private profit as an influence for
war by government manufacture of all
war munitions was urged in the senate
today by Senator Cummins of Iowa,
republican. He pleaded for prompt
adoption of his resolution which would
authorize a special committee to in
quire into the most feasible plan for
acquiring and constructing plants to
supply the army and navy with all
arms, ammunition and equipment, in
cluding ships and to report on the leg
islation necessary to prevent private
manufacture of such products.
War as Last Resort.
"I agree that war may come to this '
country," Senator Cummins declared,
"but if it comes it must be the result
of the calm, dispassionate, royal pur
pose to meet the awful scourge be
cause there is no other way of defend
ing our civilization, our institutions
and our honor.
"I do not assert that every person or
corporation which may profit from
war would Incite war, but I do assert
that all such persons and associations
are not competent to Judge the contro
versies which may lead to conflict, and
inasmuch as they cannot be removed
from the great panel of the republic,
they ought to be removed from the
business out of which the interest
grows. It ought to be made Impossi
ble, so far as the power of the gov
ernment is concerned, for any man or
corporation to make money out of war.
Need Re-baptism.
"We need just now, above all other
things,' a re-baptism in Americanism.
To me Americanism means a spirit
that commands men to live for their
country, and, if necessary, to die for
it; but I, for one, am not willing that
Americanism shall be defined and
standardized by millionaire munitions
makers or by the brokers, bankers or
backers who share their bloodstained
profits.
"In this critical moment, what is
the attitude of the makers of arms and
munitions? Without exception, so far
as I know, they are insisting on the
most comprehensive program which it
is possible to conceive, and they are
employing all forces at their command
for a completeness of preparation that
would turn this country into a military
camp and practically destroy all am
bition, save the ambition to overcome
by force of arms the entire world."
Between the Williams.
The senator said he believed that
"somewhere between the armed camp
of William of Germany and the open
dove cote of William of Nebraska there
must be an honorable abiding place
for a great nation which is prepared
to lead the world toward peace, but
will not submit to injustice or indig
nity."
Emphasizing the effect of the Eu
ropean war on private munition mak
ers in the United States, he ,told the
senate that since the war began there
had been 174 new corporations or
ganized in this country for the man
ufacture of munitions and the value of
arms and munitions exported in 15
