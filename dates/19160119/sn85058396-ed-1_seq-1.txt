ELIMINATE GRAFT I
Iowa Senator Urges Manufac- I
ture of All War Munitions
By Government Plants.
SHOULD ACT PROMPTLY I
Would Make It Impossible for
Any Man or Firm to Make
Money Out of War.
Washington, Jan. 19. Elimination:
of private profit as an influence for
war by government manufacture of all
war munitions was urged in the sen-
ate today by Senator Cummins of
Iowa, Republican.' He pleaded for H
prompt adoption of his measure which H
would authorize a special committee
to inquire into the most feasible plan
for acquiring and constructing plants H
to supply the army and navy with all
arms, ammunition and equipment in-
eluding warships, and to report on H
the legislation necessary to prevent H
private manufacture of such products. H
"I agree that war may come to this' IH
country," Senator Cummins declared, H
"but if comes it must be the result M
of the calm, dispassionate, loyal pur- . M
pose to meet the awful scourge be- M
cause there Is no other way of de- M
fending our civilization, our institu- H
tiono and our honor. H
I do not assert that every person
or corporation which may profit from fl
war would Incite war, but I do assert M
that all such persons and associations M
are not competent to judge the con- M
troversies which may lead to con-
fllct and Inasmuch as they cannot bo
removed from the great panel of tho fl
republic, they ought to be removed M
from the business out of which the M
interest grows. It ought to be made M
impossible, so far as the power of the M
government is, concerned, for any man H
or corporation to make money out of
war. H
Present Attitude of Arm3 Makers. H
"In this critical moment what is the M
attitude of the makers of arms and
munitions? Without exception so far M
as I know they are insisting upon H
the most comprehensive program H
which it is possible to conceive and H
they are employing through all the M
channels and all the instrumetalities -H
which mould public thought, all the H
resourves at their command, for a H
completeness of preparation that H
would turn this country into a mill- : H
tary camp and practically destroy all J H
ambition, save the ambition to over- ' H
come by force of arms the entire j H
world." 1
Effect of European War. jH
Emphasizing the effect of the Euro- H
pean war on private munition makers H
in the United States, he told the sen- H
ate that since the war began there H
had been 174 new corporations organ- H
ized in this country for the manufac- H
ture of munitions and the value of H
arms and munitions exported in fif- . H
teen months had aggregated $161,964,- H
27S. H
He submitted a table showing the H
following estimates of the amount of H
war contracts of some of the larger IH
corporations: i H
corporation isomracts. iB
American Car and Foundry $35,000.- iH
000; American Locomotive" $66,000- B
