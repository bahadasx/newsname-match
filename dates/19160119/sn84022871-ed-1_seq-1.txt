A SHORT HISTORY OF THE $5. t.
CHURCH IN BARTON.
The following history of the M. E.
church of Barton was given by Rev.
A. B. Blake at the annual meeting and
roll call held on New Year's day.
In Miss Abby Maria Hemenway's
Historical Gazetteer, published in
1877, we find a little history of the
Methodist Episcopal church in Barton.
She informs us that the first meeting
in town of a religious nature was held
by the Methodists in the year 1S03 or
1804, appointed by Phineas Peck, a
Methodist preacher, in Asa Kimball's
house, and that the Methodists formed
a church here in 1807 or 1808. William
Gould, John Gould, Abraham Whit
taker, Royal Cross, David Hamlet,
David Abbott. William Gould, Jr., and
Nathan Gould were among the first
members. James Gould and sme
others of Glover were members of
this church. They held their meetings
in a log sohoolbcruse north of where
William Lang then lived, (a little
west of the fairgrounds). Their quar
terly meetings were held in William
Gould's barn. Little is known of the
Methodists from the organization of the
church in 1807 until about 1820.
It 13 supposed that the war of 1812
must have imsettled matters to such
an extent as to have caused a suspen
sion of religious services for some
years, as no record of meetings being
held during these years remains. In
1828 the Methodists appear to have
been flourishing and it would appear
that for years services of some r?li
gious character had been in progress.
So thorough was their organization
that from 1828 until the present date
every year a record has ben kept,
giving the names of the Methodist
preachers stationed here, and facts of
importance every now and then have
been recorded. At that time some
kind of a reorganization, or some im-
I' pcrtant change was made by Revs.
Hezekiab Ramsdell and William Peck.
Services were held in the schoolhouse
; and the circuit comprised Barton,
j Orleans, then Barton Landing, Brown-
j ington, Irasburg, Glover and West
Glover.
Quoting Rev. Knox: Following
these in 1829 were Messrs. Stephen H.
Cutler and James Campbell. In 1830
Elisha Scott, Hora.ee A. Merriam and
John Smith served as circuit preachers
here. In 1831, John Nason, George F.
Crosby and Ira , Sweatland; 1832,
George W. Fairbanks, O. F. Curtis and
I. A. Sweatland: 1833, M. G. Cass and
G. W. Noyes; 1834, N. W. AspinwalJ
and J. Dow. During their pastorate
the brick church was built. In 1835
N. W. Aspinwall was assisted by E.

MacGuir on Africa. r
Rev. Gabriel MacGuire, pastor of
the Ruggles Street Baptist church of
Boston, one of the largest churches in
New England and one time missionary
to Africa, gave a most dramatic lec
ture on his travels "up the Congo river
into the very heart of darkest Africa
and his stay among the cannibal tribes
there.
In a large degree Dr. MacGuire s
lecture was very similar to the one
given us two years ago, yet many de
clare to have enjoyed this appearance
of Dr. MacGuire more than the other.
His very realistic description of
native customs and habits and his dis
play of native weapons, gods, articles
of clothing, and the skins of immense
snafces, and th& story of his several
narrow escapes from the wild animals
of . Africa go to make up a tale of
interest. After the lecture Mr. Mac
Guire was a guest of the Barton lm-j
provement. club at their rooms until!
the night train for Boston and enter-j
tained the men with stories of Msi
travels.

TURNRULL'S ADDRESS TO DAIRY-
MEN.
J. G. Turnbull of Orleans, president
of the Vermont Dairymen's Association
last year, addressed the members of
that organization at their annual meet
ing in Burlington last week.
Mr. Turnbull's address was in part
as follows::
Conditions are changing fast in dairy-;
ing as in every thing else. At the I
present time not only are the prices of
milk and butter, getting higher, but
the prices of farms are even higher
accordingly than the produce which is
sold from them What does this mean?
Ct mean that the farmers have got to
practice more intensive farming, as in
the case of the cow, when you could
buy a good cow for $25 or $30 you did
not get, neither did you need to get, as
much out of. her as you roust get at
the present time out of one that costs
three or more times as much. So with
the high-priced farms of today more
intensive farming must be practiced.
A young man cannot buy a farm today
at the price he will be obliged to pay
and make success unless he brings it
up to the highest state of efficiency. I
hope I won't be accused f taking
sides in this awful war when I say
that the secret of the German success
in our western country is in bringing
their rarms up to a high state of culti
vation. I might add that our German
farmers have qualifications that any
young man who wishes to succeed in
farming would do well to emulate, i.
e. thrift and close attention to busi
ness. There is one thing that is de
manding our attention more and more,
and that, is the sanitary condition of
our milk and cream. All must admit
that there is need for improvement
along these lines The hand separator
is one of the bet helps to the farmer

Mrs. E. F. Hobson.
"A woman that feareth the Lord,
she shall be praised." (Prov. 31:30)
Such a woman, in whose praise too
much cannot be said or written, was
Mrs. Nellie Gertrude Hobson, who
Sunday morning at 9 30 in the hospital
at St. Johnsbury, passed to her heav
enly home. The remains were brought
back to her late home in Newport
Monday morning, and on Tuesday
afternoon the last rites of the church
were said, and the body was entombed
ha the cemetery at West Derby to be
interred in the spring beside the bodies
of three small children in the cemetery
at Island Pond, to await the resurrec
tion morning. A large company of
relatives and friends were present at
the funeral services and three dozen
beautiful floral tributes from various
societies to which the deceased was
connected and from personal friends
and kindred, adorned the casket and
stands. The Rev. I. A. Ranney. Meth
odist minister from Barton, read two
brief scripture lessons and the Rev.
W. S. Smithers, minister from Orleans,
offered prayer. Mrs. J. Wilson sang a
beautiful solo, after which the pastor
of the Methodist church of Newport,
Rev C. W. Kelley, made a short ad
dress. Nellie Gertrude Lang was born
in East Charleston June 17, 1860 and
was united in marriage to Eugene
Faber Hobson in 1881. As a result of
this marriage, five children were born
to them, two dying in infancy, one at
the age of five years, and two are now
living, Mrs. Beatrice H. Cooling of
Baltimore, Md., and Miss Elsie Lucilo.
who resides at home. For a time Mr.
and Mrs. Hobson lived in Island Pond,
later going to Chicago, where they
remained three years, returning again
to Island Pond. They also lived for a
few years in Barton and a year ago
last fall moved to Newport where Mr.
Hobson entered the employ of True &
Blanchard, hardware dealers. Mrs.
Hobson was a devoted wife and mother
and she will be greatly missed in the
home, where her place will be empty.
She was also a devoted Christian and
faithful member of the Methodist
Episcopal church, enlisting in the uiis
sionary and temperance societies, and
as far as her strength permitted doing
very efficient work in these organiza
tions. She was teacher of a large
organized class of women known as
the "Tuckabache Class" and through
this class a great deal of charity work
has been done. Mrs. Hobson was also
as a member of the Rebekahs and at
one time of the Eastern Star. Her
entire life was one of service. She
believed that the good Lord had saved
her to serve others and, although not
always a well woman, it could be said
of her at all times, "she hath done
what she could." She was seriously
ill only a few weeks - when - the end
came, and her death has cast a shadow
not only over the homes of her dear
ones, but over the communities where
she formerly resided and where she
will he pleasantly remembered for
what she was and for what she has
done. George C. Lang of Barton, is a
brother and Mrs. A. R. Campbell of
Morrisville is a sister of the deceased,
and to them and to the husband and
two daughters we extend the sympathy
of their many friends Among those
present from out of town were Mr.
and Mrs. Campbell of Morrisville, Mr.

SCHOOL NOTES
The following letters explain them
selves: New York State Hospital for the
Care of Crippled and Deformed Chil
dren, WestHaverstraw,N.Y.,Dec.27.1915.
To the Sixth, Seventh, Eighth and
Ninth Grades.
It was very kind indeed for the boys
and girls of Barton to remember our
children at this season. The parcels
arrived in good time and the popcorn,
scrapbooks, toys and "Youths' Com
panions" added greatly to our Christ
mas joy. It is impossible in a few
words to let the boys and girls know
how much happiness they gave to oar
patients. We have 92 children now,
and it would have been out of our
power to provide Christmas for all,
had it not been for this contribution.
As it was, your generosity enabled us
to have something for every child in
the institution, and we send our most
earnest thanks to each one who helped.
Yours very truly,
John Joseph Nutt,
Superintendent,
School for the Deaf,
Momantown, N. C , Jan. 3, 1916
To the Fourth and Fifth Grades :
You must think me very remiss in
being so long acknowledging the pretty
scrap-books and toys sent to us by the
boys and girls of Barton. They came
the day before Christmas and were,
most gladly received. Please say to
those who made them that our children
wish to thank them. The things were
sent to our primary department and
gave great pleasure to the little ones.
One of the teachers. Miss McGill, is
from Vermont and for that reason was
especially interested in the books.
They were certainly neatly and
beautifully, made. I wish each child
had put his name on his book ; bad he
done so, he would have received a
personal letter from the child who
received it. As it is, they all send
their thanks through me. . Could the
boys and girls of Barton have seen the
joy on the faces of our little deaf chil
dren when they received the pretty
things, they would have been more
than repaid for their trouble. We
send them all many good wishes for
the New Year.
Very sincerely,
Mary C. Mauzy,
Teacher of Articulation.

Sunday, 16th. The first Sunday after
Consolation (or Disconsolation, maybe).
Consolation that the awful and nerve
racking period of examinations has
come to a close, oh, the pathos of it
all!
Monday 17th. As we boys and girls
trudge to school today, let us remem

fondly hoping that through the day and

ourselves, to our parents and to our
God.

Wednesday, 19th. After fighting
many pitched battles, and wearing

It's to be a masquerade.

"Announced by -all the trumpets of
the sky.
Arrives the snow, and driving o'er the
fields
Seems nowhere to alight, the whitened
air
Hides bills and woods, the river, and
the heavens,
And veils the farmhouse at the gar--
: den's end."
