LANSINGHEARS
Reports to State Department
Fail to Tell of Single Case in
Which Bandits Have Been
Executed.
Customs Collector at Border De
clares Rodriquez and Baca
Valles May Not Have Been
Involved.
Astfar as the State Department
has been advised, not a single one
of the Villista bandits responsible
for the massacre of the seventeen
Americans near Santa Ysabel,
Mexico, has been captured and
punished.
The Americans were murdered
on January 10. On the day fol
lowing the American Government
'dispatched a note to General Car
ranza, first chief of the de facto
government, calling upon him to
pursue, capture and punish im
mediately all those responsible for
the outrage.
Pending compliance by Car
ranza with these demands; .the Ad
Jnfnwtaition. has been- bending
eyery effort to withstand the
pressure in Congress in favor of
ftrtned intervention.
. MAY BE INNOCENT.
Although the State Department re
ceived today from Collector of Customs
Cobb at El Paso a report that the
bodies of Rodriguez and Baca-Valles,
captured and executed By Carranza
soldiers, had been placed on exhibition
in Juarez as proof of what the Car
ranza authorities were doing to run
down the perpetrators of the massacre,
Cobb stated that there was no proof
whatever that these men were Involved
In the murders.
Rodriguea. Cobb states, was blowing
up bridges In western Chihuahua at tho
time of the massacre, and probublv had
nothing to do with the attack. There
is nothing, ho says, to show that Bnca
"Valles, who was known as Villa's
"butcher," was Involved.
.How long the American Government
proposes to wait for the Carranza
authorities to avenge tho massacre, of
ficials at tho Btata Department and
White House refuse to say. They state
that Carranza will be given a "decent
chance" to comply.
Hasn't Submitted Kcport.
Secretary Lansing has not yet sub
mitted to the President the special re
port which he has prepared to be sent
to the Senate In response to the Fall
resolution. This will be done. It wns In

Parley Rumored Broken
LONDON, Jan. 19. Pence
negotiations between Aus

been broken off, according
to an unconfirmed wireless
report from Rome today.
The dispatch said that reports'
of tho surrender of the
Montenegrin army were
"premature."
The report is accepted with
some reserve ii view of con
firmation of the report of
Montenegro's surrender by
Montenegrin diplomats in
Rome and Paris.
ALLIES CALL WAR
French Premier Attends Hur
riedly Called Session of En
tente Delegates.
LONDON'. Jan. 19.-Wlth startling
suddenness, following swiftly moving
events In the Balkans the allies' war
council was summoned for a meeting
today.
Shortly before noon, military repre
sentatives of tho allied powers, accom
panied bv Premier Brland. of Prance,
went Into session at Downing street.
The French premier's presence Indi
cates that political matters of the
greatest Importance are to bo discussed
in addition to the military situation.
His arrival In London was the first in
timation that the council was to meet
today.
Deny Ultimatum.
The foreign ofllce has issued a stuto
ment denying, the rumor that any ulti
matum had been delivered to Greece,
while fast upon It came Athens reports
that all Greek troops arc being with
drawn from the Gfeqo.-iiulgariaii irw

Believed to Be Preliminary Step
Toward Strengthening the
Blockade of All Germany.
liONDON, Jan. 19. Provision for the
addition of 60,000 more men to the Brit
ish, navy was looked upon In some quar
ters today as a preliminary step to
ward tho laying of a blockade of the
entire German coast.
The public has not been permitted to
learn how many new ships have been
added to the navy since the war began.
It was recently stated, however, that
fourteen super-dreadnaughts as well as
scores of smaller craft have been com
pleted, and aro ready for service. The
fact that 60.000 men are to be added to
tho navy personnel Indicates that the In
crease in new ships Is surprisingly
larcu.
Tho addition of theso forces will place
about 260.000 men at the disposition of
the admiralty.

the Treasury an unexpended balance
of moro than $1,000,000, or a sum suf

HOUSE TO PASS
SUBSTITUTE
SCHOOL BILL
Explains to Subcommittee Why
Commissioners Urge Abolish
ment of Board of Education
Here.
Offers Concession to Opponents
by Giving Jurisdiction Over
Principals and Teachers to
Director.
Commissioner Oliver P. New
man today told the subcommittee
on education Of the House District
Committee why the Commission
ers want ' complete jurisdiction
over the public school system and
the abolishment of the Board of
Education, and offered to the
committee a substitute bill carry
ing these recommendations into
effect.
The substitute bill offers a con-
cession to the opponents of the
proposed legislation that it pro
vides that appointments, promo
tions, removals and transfers of
principals and teachers shall be
made by the director of education
and not by the Commissioners as
originally suggested.
Another statement made by Com
missioncr Newman in the way of
compromise was that the present
board of Commissioners is quitt
willing to have the proposed change
in the public school system post-
, poned in effectiveness until the pres
ent Commissioners are out of office,
although the legislation Is desired
now.
Another important development
of the initial hearing before the
House subcommittee was the as
sertion by Commissioner Newman
that President Wilson is in favor
of various administrative reforms
affecting the District government.
TOLD BY PRESIDENT.
Mr. Newman said he would not quote
the President as suggesting any spe
