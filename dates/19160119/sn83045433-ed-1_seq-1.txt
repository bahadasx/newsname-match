Teuton Spy Disappears, Car

Nation-wide Search Being Made for

Undecipherable Papers.

f Nfir York. Jan. 18.?A portfolio of
papers Invaluable to the government
In It* International .??py plot Investiga
tion disappeared last Saturday from a
Brooklyn restaurant with Ignatiu.s
Timothy Treblch Lincoln, confessed
German spy. it was revealed tonight.
Lincoln had promised to unravel for
the government secret German code
books, according to an official. The
baffling cod*? of the Teuton secret ser
vice was found among the papers of
Paul Koenlg, Kram von Rlntelen. and
others who have come within tha
scope of the government's sweeping In
vestigation of th* bomb and arson con
spiracies.
Lincoln calmly escaped from Deputy
I'nited States Marshal Frank Johnson
by strolling out of a Brooklyn restau
rant. The spy was awaiting extradi
tion to Kngland on a forgery charge.
Tonight's starting- developments ex
plain why the Department of Justice,
co-operating with municipal and other
Federal authorities. have thrown out
a country-wide dragnet.
It explains also why there was a
lapj* of three days before the spy's
escape came to public notice.

Ctftirt against an order of deportation to
Kngland. \
In the meantime he made an apparently
frank offer to the government to aid
them In tran*l*ttng German secret codes
with which he was familiar. It is these
secret codes and other undecipherable
papers which were in tbe portfolio he
took with him when he escaped, accord
ing to a government authority.
r^-ft. William Offtey. chief of the local
buieal of Investigation of the Depart
ment of Justice, was much perturbed this
rrentas when asked about the missing
papers. He denied with a great deal 01
vehemence that Lincoln had succeeded in
making away with some of the govern
ment's prospective evidence.
So far only one clue as to the missing
spy's whereabouts has come to the scores
of men who are scouring the country for
him. Operators on Monday intercepted
a letter written by Lincoln f*Jt a friend.
The letter was mailed from a Bronx
postofflce station. The Federal investi
gators have the names of fifteen men
who visited IJncaln at the jail. All ot
then> are under constant surveillance.

follows:
"1. The board concludes the ex

pockets of this mixture, one at th*

"4. The condition of the batteries at
the low voltage and amperage, 82 and
?MO, respectively, at about 12.25 p. m.
would probably cause a reversal of vol

Citizens To Be Heard Today |
In Fight On School Change
-
Campaign Waged by The Washington Herald and Civic
Bodies Against Commissioners' Plan to Abolish Board
of Education Will Be Reached Before Subcommittee.
The climax of the campaign of The
Washington Herald and citizens of the
District against th? proposal of the Dls
trlct Commissioners to abol? uh the Board
lof Education and assume complete con
trol of the school system will be reached
this morning, when representatives of
the forty civic organization? that have
adopted resolutions opposing the suggest
ed plan will appear before a subcommit
tee of the House District Committee to
voice their protest in emphatic and un
mistakable language.
The occasion will be the opening of a
two-days' hearing on the question of the
proposed change. It will be before Hep
reaentatlve Lloyd's subcommittee of the
District committee, and will be held at
M>:J0 o'clock in the District rommittee
room In the House Office Building.
Preeldent Henry P. Blair of the Board
of Education will open the ffght of riti
ene. Other members of Wie board will
be present.
Delegation^ from citizens' ajwociatlons
will be at the meeting to further the argu
mente of President Blair in pointing out
that such a change would destroy the
present broad system of education. The |
delegations from the associations will t
act independently of the board directors.
That the fight will be drawn out is as
?unidd from the fact that many Dis
trict bod i e ? have delayed taking action
on the matter and therefore are not
ready to appear before th? House sub
committee. The most important of suih|
organizations Is the Federation of Cltl-l
zens' Associations, the course of which Is '
forecast in the action of nearly a majority
of member organizations In opposing the
| Commissioners.
, 1..e Board of Education, to have met
today, has po5tponed the session because j
lof the hearing.
i The schools committee of the Chamber ?
lof Commerce yesterday appointed former!
?Senator Marion Butler as that organisa-1
? tion's spokesman. The chamber was the!
first District organization to t-?ke up the
Commissioners' recommendations, the

Holland-American Liner
Reaches British Port with
151 Passengers.
Special Ctsble to Tt? Wuhtncton Henid.
Isondoii. Jan. IS.?The Holland-Ameri
can liner Ryndam, which met with a
mysterious accident in the English Chan
nel, arrived late tonight at Gravesend.
The liner haa a heavy list to starboard
and was down low In the water at the
bow.
Some secrecy is being maintained re
garding the accident. All of the pas
sengers who did not land at Falmouth
were kept aboard tonight, in accordance
with official instructions.
According to official announcement.
none of the passengers were Injured In
the accident, although It is admitted that
three stokers were killed and four others
seriously injured.
The liner left New York on January
G? with 1?1 paaaengera. The first intima
tion that she had met with an accident
came today when she passed South End.
It waa then notlred that she listed badly.
Offera of assistance were ? fused.
Nothing has been announced as yet
as to the cause of the accident. Borne
rumors were current that it was
caused either by an Internal explosion
or by striking a mine.
The movements of the Ryndam of
the past few days are unaccoutned for.
No concern was felt for the safety of
the liner. Inasmuch as Holland-Ameri
can steamers are held up for two or
three days at Falmouth by the British
authorities.
Since she left Falmouth tlie steamer
must have passed around the southern
end of England. This is out of the
couree of Holland-American liners,
and it is believed that the Ryndham
must have changed her route ?*>> order
of the admiralty.

By R. MACKENZIE.
Rome. Jan. 18?Reports that th?
Mont***.? grins were heroically fighting th?
Austri? ns were false. On the contreu-y.
they wore secretly aiding them. They
even informed the Austrians of the ar
rival of ahipa conveying provision-? and
munition? from Italy, thu? enabling tbe
Austrian submarines to sink the vessels
King Nicholas has been secretly leagued
with the Austrians since October and
practically solicited invasions of his
country, which he betrayed with the
obje? t of concluding a separate peac*.
This explanation fully Ju?tlfies the at
titude of the allies, who knew that tc
aid Montenegro, would be worse than
useless. Had they supplied guns ana
ammunition to the Montenegrins, they :
would simply have fallen into th?
Austrian? hands
King Nicholas alone Is? responsible for
betraying his country. The majority
the Montenegrins, including hi? sons, ar?
opposed to a separate peace, which Is
bound to lead, sooner or later, to th?
dethronement of the King.
