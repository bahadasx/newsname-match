FATAL ACCIDENT NEAR
VILLAGE OF ALVARADO
Martin Ross is Killed When Load of
Oats Topples Over.
Martin Ross, a young farmer who
lived a short distance from Alvarado
met an accidental death on Monday
this week when hauling a load of
oats to town. He had driven but a
short distance from home, when for
some reason the load tipped over in
to the ditch on top of Mr. Ross
There was no eye witness to the ac
cident but the supposition is that he
stood on one of the runners of the
sleigh, when a jerk or sudden stop
on the part of the horses or the
skidding of the sled, precipitated the
$* ]pad over him Some time after
ywards, neighbors discovered the load
ditch and upon further mves
\21 tigation found the body of Mr. Ross
underneath it, cold in death. He
was a young man, about 27 year old,
and had come from Illinois newly
married two years ago. Mr. Ross,
was a young farmer of the progress
ive kind, his farm being one of the
best equipped in the neighborhood.
His death is a great loss to the com
munity which he intended to help
build up by his work and energy in
the years to come, and an irrepar
able loss to the young wife whose
hopes of a long and happy married
life have been blasted.

Young Potato King.
According to an announcement by
the agricultural department of the
Minnesota state university, the best
potato grower in the state among the
boys is Oscar Larson, of Viking.

els of potatoes on one acre of
ound, at a cost of only 12 cents

only in Minnesota, but also in the
whole country. Allen Strand, of
East Grand Forks, raised 360 bush
els. Among the girls, 13-year old
Elizabeth Tofte, from Tofte, won the

A MAIL ORDER DODGE.
Where Home Merchants Know How
to Advertise, They Shun Town.
It is said that some of the mail or-
^^^er houses employ a clipper bureau
to furnish them with the names of
weekly newspapers that carry an un
usually large amount of local adver
tising so that they can save on post
age, according to the Walker Pilot.
Sending catalogs to people in a town
where merchants are live advertisers
has about the same effect as a coun
try editor sending a subscription
statement to a dead delinquent sub
scriber. rp
