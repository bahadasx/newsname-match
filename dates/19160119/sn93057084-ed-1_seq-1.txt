FRIENDSHIP.
Nothing but the harmony of
friendship soothes our sorrows with
out its sympathy there is no hap
piness on earth.—Mozart.
They are slaves ivho fear to speak
For the fallen and the weak.
They are slaves who will not
choose
Hatred, scoffing and abuse
kRather than in silent, sJiirck
From the truth they needs must
think
They are slaves ivho dare not be
In the right ivith two or three.
James Russell Lowell.
The Press, does not need to
make any apologies or excuses
for the "preaching" it purposes to
indulge in from this time forward.
By doing so, it will be following
in the footsteps of two of the
largest and most influential dailies
in South Dakota, viz: the Aber
deen American and Sioux Falls
Argus-Leader. The editors them
selves of these dailies write on
religious subjects regularly once a
week.
Illnnt Advocate: "Girls, you
will now have an- opportunity of
exercising the right to win a happy
home. This year is leap-year and
the members of the bachelor brig
ade around Blunt are already
trembling over the prospect of
being wooed and won by some fair
damsel, while others, too bashful
to start anything themselves, are
sincerely hoping that "the girl"
will arise to the occasion and exer
cise the rights and prerogatives
giyen her during leap-jTear."
The Press hasnt heard of any
one in or around Forest City
"trembling" over the advent of
leap-year they are all prepared
to calmly meet the situation—in

We have received one of the
South Dakota State Fair Calendars
and it makes one of the finest
office Calendars out for the year
1916. One of these oalendars may
be had by sending three cents in
stamps to Secretary C. N. Mcll
vaine, Huron, S. D.
The First National Bank of
Gettysburg has sent us one of
their fine big 1916 calendars. A
new feature of it is that eachtpage
carries a small "insert" of the
preceding and succeeding month,
which is often a handy thing to
have. The First National is one
of the strongest institutions in the
county and a good firm to consul
with regarding a loan or other
financial matters.
We give our readers this week
the county commissioners proceed
ings, whioh also contains the au
ditor and treasurer's quarterly
financial statement, in the shape
of a supplement. From this lat
ter report, it would appear thai
the county's financial condition is
in fine shape, there being $41,657.

Charley Marshall was over from
Gettysbure with the Standard oil
wagon, Monday, and remained till
Wednesday, owing to a piece of
bad luck—or more properly speak
ing, owing to a 'measly' narrow
road. As he was going down the
river bank near the ola Kluth res
idence the hind wheels of the wag
on slid off the track resulting in
the wagon-tank rolling over on its
side. It took one days time to get
the tank sufficiently emptied so it
be could be raised to its proper
position and another day and
night was consumed in getting the
balance of the oil out of the tank
and delivery made to its numerous
customers
