HELP FOR ROADS.
I Tax All Vehicles and Apply Proceeds'
to Road Improvements.
Judge Sam Edwards, of Cookeville,
is one of the most insistent, never-say
die, good roads ent!.ui5asts in the state.
So persistently earnest is ne about
good roads that hi mind works like a
forty-horsepower auto engine trying to
devise a way to raise more funds for
roads.
He favors the passage of a law simi
lar to the one that places a tax on
automobiles, fie favors a law taxing
buggies fifty cents, one-horse wagons
one dollar, two-horse wagons two dol
lars and log wagons three dollars a
year. He would have the amount paid
to the county clerk of the respective
counties and a small metal tag be
given along with the license and that
tag fastened to the vehicle.
Judge Edwards stated to the writer
that he hoped to get such a bill passed
by the next legislature.
The idea advanced by Judge Edwards
is a good one and would furnish a very
substantial increase to the funds us
ually available for roads.
It Judge Edwards will also incorpor
ate in his proposed measure the wide
tire idea, he will have done more for
good roads in Tennessee than any other
single person, provided he is able to
get it on the statute books. That
should be a ta k of ho great magnitude
at this time vv en there is so much en
thusiasm over ad improvement.

The enterU.i. i:t bj the Crossville
Concert band brought out a nouse Fri
day night that taxed the seating ca
pacity of the circuit court room, and
netted the hand boys about $5(1.
From start to finish there was not a
dull or uninteresting number on the
program. The splendid manner in
which every one curried out his part
was something ot a surprise as so good
and complete an entertainment was
hardly to be expected, considering the
short time in which they had to pre
pare it. Less than two months ago
the first horns were received for the
band and many ot the boys could not
even make a noise on them without
practice, so new was the effort to
them.
The burnt cork work they rendered
was splendid and elicited much ap
plause from the audience. Not in
many months has there been any effort
presented to our people that brought
out so much praise lor the excellence
of the exercises. The public was so
well pleased with the lirst effort that
they will be eager t

Committee Appoinlbd to De
vise Better Assessment
When the January term of county
court convened last week all justices
were present. An unusual amount of
business was transacted and the teim
extended to noon of the second day.
Judge G. t'. Burnett made his usual
quarterly report, which was accepted
by the court.
The report of the county judge show
ed 16,0U0 railroad bonds outstanding
and $19,000 court house bonds out
standing. There being available funds
on hand for the purpose the court di
rected that Judge Burnett take up
$2,000 in court house bonds. Afte'- the
$2,000 court house bonds ae cancelled
the total remaining indebtedness ot the
county will be close to $76,000. Of
this amount $2,255 is bridge wamrsts
that were issued for building bridges
and are not yet due.
County Health Uliicer E. W. Mitchell
made his report, which was accepted,
and it shows that there are now no
contagious diseases prevalent in the
county. He recommended that practi

oners in the jail be burned and l ew be
supplied as a sanitary measure He
reports the poornouse in good condition
and the inmates doing well.

Webb's report was read and accepted.
SCHOOL yUi-,0-
Superintendent oi Public Instruction
J. S. Cline made his report for the
scholastic year ending June 30, 1916.
In this connection i: dge Burnett took
occasion to correct an erroneous state
ment that had been publicly made by
nne ol the county board ol education
wherein the charge had been made that
Crossville is receiving more than its
due share of the school fund ot the
county. Judge Burnett stated that the
entire school fund was divided by the
total number of scholars enumerated
and on that basis the amount due per
BCholaf was turned over by the trustees
to the city authorities of Crossville,
which showed conclusively that Cross
ville does not receive more than its just
part of the public school fund. The
statement by Judge Burnett was veri
fied by Superintendent J. S. Cline and
Chairman M L. Taylor of the ooard of
education. Judge Burnett further ex
plained that he reason why the school
term in Crossville is longer than in the
rural schools is that the corporation of
Crossville levies a tax for school pur
puses to supplement that obtained from
the county and oy mat means ine ppo-
pie of Crossville pay
Se hooting the children
for the extra
get over that
j enjoyed by the rural schools.
Road Commissioner K. E. Hamby
made his report, which was accepted.
It was ordered that blanks be furnished
the road commissioners and overseers
on which to make complete report.
Mr. Hamby was re-elected for the en
suing year.
Francis Myers was elected road com
missioner for the second district and T.
L. Hale tor the third district and J.
K. Smith for the fourth district.
COUNTY PHYSICIAN.
On going into an election tor county

and Dr. W. A. Keed were printed.
The vote stood six toi Keed and rive
for Lewis. Dr. Keed was declared
elected.
the salary of tl-e county physician
was fixed at $350 and his duties pre
scribed. J. E. Converse appeared before the
onH nrpapntpd untTiB vprv eonvino-

one vote, the vote standing five for and
six against.
COUNTY SANITATION.
Dr. K. Q. Lillur i. secretary of the
state hoard of health, appeared before
the court and urged; that an appropria
tion of $300 be made for sanitation
work throughout the county. The ap
p: . nation was voted on the under
standing that the state would furnish'
$900 for the same purpose.
Seven hundred dollars was transfer
red from the railroad fund to the High
School tund.
NOTARIES PUBLIC
A. Lee, D. F. Hamby, U. S. Rose
and H. L. Woody w re elected notaries
public. J. D. McLlarney made his re
port as chief probation officer of the
county and asked for titty dollars for
; his services from April 1, 1914, to Jan
uary 1, 1916. The rep rt was accepted
except the amount asked and the court
then fixed the salai j at $10 a year.
The question of i uilding a bridge at
the old Genesis place was deterred un
til the Dixie Highway tie located in
that district or until the April term of
court.
John Ettien was al owed $2.50 for
lumber furnished the load commission
er of the first district.
A petition was presented to the court
asking for a voting precinct to be cre
ated at Hales Chapel The request
was filed for action at the July term,
as six months is required to elapse be
fore voting precincts can be created.
OLD CLAIMS.
ft seems there is some attorney at
Washington, D. C, who is wanting a
fee for looking after certain claims
that he says are in sight there where
by this county can secure certain sums
of money. An order was passed au
thorizing Judge Burnett to employ an
attorney to look after the said claims,
if in his judgement such a course is ad
visable, but in no event is the county
to be liable for any costs or attorneys'
tees. It seems the lawyer will not tell
what the claims are or give any infor
mation until he is employed. Indica
tions are that it is a fraud and Judge
Burnett is not at all liable to engage
the lawyer or any other person on any
such flimsy grounds.
LIME PULVER COMMITTEE.
The committee appointed to purchase
the lime pulver made its report which
showed that they had purchased the
pulver equipment at a c st of a little
over $1400 and had in addition pur
chased 57 acres of land nt ('rah Orch
ard for $1,000. It was explained that
the purchase of ihe land was rendered
tjecessarv because no satisfactory
terms c old be arranged with any land
owner for securing the necessary lime
rock, n is the purpose of the commit
tee to charge residents $1.00 a ton and
non-residents $1.25 until such a time
as it becomes apparent that a less
charge can be safely made.
Archie Beadle was permanently re
leased from road work and payment of
poll tax. Henry Wyatt and George
Kindrick were released in the same
manner and Henry Green tor one year.
ROAD BONDS.
A resolution was presented to the
court by the bond buyers to be spread
ot record, which was accepted. Also a
copy of the bonds and coupons in the
words used was presented and spread
of record. The bonds arc to bear in
terest from January 1, 1916, the inter
est to he due and payable semi-annually
on January and July J, of each year.
The bonds are to run for forty years,
which will make them fall due Janu
ary 1, 1956, but may be paid all or in
part al any interest period after Janu
ary 1, 1936, alter sixty days published
notice. The bonds are to be signed by
the county court clerk and not by the
county judge as in most cases. This
was deemed necessary and was incorp
orated in the act to avoid complications
due to the passage of the act abolish
ing the office of county judge, which
was gotten through the legislature by
Senator Wilson at its last term.
SPECIAL TAX COMMITTEE.
the court that Esqs. c. L. l atherage,
R. A. Powel. D. W. Lundy, E. G. Tol

nett he and they are hereby appointed
a special committee to devise and re
commend to the county assessor some
equitable and fair plan for assessing
real estate of the county so that the
renlt.v inav be more nearly assessed at
its actual cash value, and that the as
sessment irrv be equalized so tar as
possible, that all property of the same
ciass and character may be given the
same valuation. Said committee will
also so investigate the tax -ate now in
force and recommend to The next term
of this court a rate based on the asses
sed valuation that will nroduce re
venue to run the county for 1916, low
ering or raising the rate as the condi
tions justify. It is recommended by
the court that the assessor d"ter mak
ing any assessment until said commit
tee has made its recommendations to
jhim, and that he foilow said recoui
! inendations as elosply as possible in
making his assessment. ' '

BIRTHDAY CELEBRATION.
' J, A. Hodgins Invites the Band and Nu
merous Friends to a Banquet
on His 71st Birthday.
! Wednesday evening the members of
the C rossville band and several invited
giusts were the recipients of a most
bounteous supper at the Nicholas
House as the gusts of J. A. Hodgins,
j of Kouts, Indiana.
At the appointed hour the city band
met at the Nicholas House and played
several familiar airs, after which they
and the other invited guests repaired
to the dining room, where Mr. Hodgins
as host had caused two long tables to
be prepared and loaded with the
choicest viands. Nearly thirty people
partook of the splendid banquet, that
had been prepared in the most elabor
ate manner of the splendid cuisine of
the Nicholas House, that is noted for
many counties around as one of the
best hotels of this section of the state.
After the banquet Judge G. P. Bur
nett, on behalf of the band and other
invited guests, extended most hearty
thanks for the splendid banquet served
and for the most delightful evening
spent.

friends here as well as in Indiana, is
an old federal solider who is bubbling
over with patriotism, and good will to
ward everybody. In his home post he
holds the Dositionof Patriotic Instruct
or and it is quite
lear that no one bet-
ter prepared to m
pire others with the
true spirit ii p;
liiotisio could have
been chosen.
Mr. Hodgins bar been here only a
tew weeks, but his kindly and genial
bearing has won for him many friends
who will wish for him many returns of
the day that marked the seventy-hrst
mile stone of his life.
