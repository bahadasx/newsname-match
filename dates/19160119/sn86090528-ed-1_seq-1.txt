tiff in the sum of $ loS.03. In thia caae
I lie defendants set up as a defense a

proximately $SOO, principal and accru

the Jury took the original notes, al
itged to have, been executed, by the
Ceft.ndant, together with tho checks
fur amounts which had bn paid upon

in the principal. From the original

This rase will probably occupy the
attention of the court throughout the
day. Over twenty witnesses have been
mbpoened and each witness lias a
lengthy story to toll hen put on the
stand.
According to the petition of the
plaintiff, and the testimony thus far
deduced, the defendant, on the ninth
dav of September, last past, at a sal-!
given by the defendant, bought a bunch,
of steers eisht. or nine In number.'
The bone of contention, according to
the testimony seems to be one small
steer of the alleged value of $111.50.
The plaintiff al'egcs that Brown
bought the. nine steers at $19.50 all
arourd: that he told him after the sale
and after he had settled for the steers,
that he had bought but eight; that the
plaintiff told defendant he did not
want him to pay for more than he
had bought; that defendant was given
back his check issued In payment for
the nine steers and gave In lieu there
of another check In payment for eight
fleers; that plaintiff afterwards
found that the rmall steer had been
tide-herded from the others and left
on his hands; that he demanded of
defendant that he take the little fel
low and pay for him; that defendaut
and plaintiff agreed to leave the mat
ter to Col. Hubbard, tho auctioneer,
and abide by his decision; that Col.
Hubbard appeared on the scene to ar
bitrate the matter; the defendant re
fused to arbitrate and stated to Col.
Hubbard that he "did not care to em
harass him (Col. Hubbard) by havliiR
him settle or decide the matter;" that
defendant further alleged the matter
had better be settled in court.
Attorney Oscar Simpson and A.
L Herr represent the plaintiff,
while the Interests of the defendant
nre,beiiig looked after by Attorney Ad
Melton. The attorneys are exerting
every effort to relieve the trial of tedi
ousness and ore effording great amuse
ment to both the Jury and the onlook
ers and court attendants. From the
time the first witness was called to the
r.tand until the court reressed for
noon. The ense proved very entertaining-
to all present. When the attor
r.ey for the one fI'I" would propound u
question to a witness it was a ten to
one bet that the attorney represent
Jng the other side would bounce to his
feet, with the agility of one long fed
on a diet of India rubber, and inter
pose an objection to the witness an
swering the question. Then the dia
logue would start. "Irrelevant, im
material and so forth," would shout the
one attorney, while the other would de
claim in sonorous tones that It was
no such thing. The witness would sit
in palpitating waiting until Judge
Jones would either over-rule the ob
jection or sustain, and than answer
or not as tha case might be. With
the ensueing question the same enter
tainment would be pulled off and re
peated by the attorneys. These effort
on the part of those learned in th
law aided materially in robbing th
case of all dryness and kept the Jurors
In a good humor With themselves and
with the world at large.
Whenever an objection was over
ruled the attorney who pc3ed as the
sire of that particular objection, failed
not to save his exception. A conserva
tive estimate, made it is alleged by a
court attache, states that Attorney
Melton had, up to the noontime recess
saved fior less than three bushel1?
three pecks and a gallon of "excep
tions' . while Attorney Simpson was
running a close second with three bush
eis and a gallon to his credit.
At the noon recess hour the plain
tiff had not finished the examination
of his witnesses. Therefore the proba
bilities are that the case will lap well
over toward the hours of early candle-
lighting.

Four more bills were introduced in
the house Tuesday, bringing the total
bills now in the house hopper up to
eleven. On the second day of the last
regular session there were more than
two hundred. One of these include

rew anti-gambling law even more
stringent than the one recently nulli
fied by the supreme court. It is prac
tically the same law with the addi
tion of two new sections designed to
make it more effective. One of these I
provides that if county and city offi
cials fail to enforce it they will be
guilty of a misdemeanor and upon con

office again for a period of two years.
The other section relates to amend
ments on rules of evidences in prose
cutions based on the gambling law.
Senate Bill No. 2 was introduced by

ate committee on appropriations. It

ficiencies in the state highway depart

the Bartlesville Central Trades and

United Trades council of Ardmore, the

Motive for Desperate Deed

is Found Dead; Leaves Three Letters
But None Shed Light on
Tragedy
By United Press,
OKLAHOMA CITY, Jan. 19.-J. C.
Welday, state chairman of the So
cialist party, shot and killed himself
today In his room at the Kinkade ho
tel. Welday was to have been married
tonight to Miss Olive Todd, a daughl
ter of a prominent local oil man.
At one time Welday was a teacher
in the public schools here, but objeo
tions to his retention in the position
arose when he became active in the
Socialist party. For some time he ha:i
been the Oklahoma editor of the Ap
peal to Reason, the Socialist paper pub
lished at Girard, Kan.
At 10:05 o'clock this morning Wel
day telephoned H. M. Sinclair, state
secretary cf the Socialist pfty, ' re
questing him to come over to his room
at the hotel as he had something im
portant to tell him. Sinclair left hY
office, which is four or five blocks
from the hotel, and reached the room
about ten minutes later. He knocked
on the door and on receiving no re
sponse opened it and walked in, find
ing Welday dead as a result of a bul
let wound.
No motive for the suicide of Welday
is known. He left three letters, one
addressed to Sinclair, one to W. O.
Moore, a teacher in the local high
school, and the other to John M. Hale,
of the Wilkins-Hale bank. All of them
referred entirely to business matters,
making no mention of the deed which
the writer was about to commit. The
letters were read before the coroner's
jury thi3 afternoon. The one to Halo
gave instructions concerning an in
surance policy hehl by the deceased,
directing that his room rent at the ho
tel be paid, that a note for $100 be
taken up and his funeral expenses
paid.
Mis3 To.id declined to believe the in.
port when told that her fiance was
dead and later when convinced it wa3
true she became hysterical.
Wolday was a member of the high
school faculty, being in charge of the
department of mathematics at the time
when J. O. McMasters was principal.
He lost his position when the latter
was let out, having taken a prominent
part in the rl'lical mixnp in school
board affairs.
Welday was about 30 years of age
and as far as known was in the best
of health. If he had any financial trou
bles bis friends knew nothing about
them.
