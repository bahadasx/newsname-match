ADVANTAGES FOB NEUTRALS.
LANSING SUGGESTS STUDY OF
I NEUTRAL RIGHTS TO INSTI?
TUTE OF INTERNATION.
AL LAW.
k
eretoforc All of the Advantages Have
Gone to Belligerents, Says Secre?
tary.
Washington, Jan. 16.?A study of
'neutral rights and duties with a view
to reversing the traditional processes
pi defining neutrality which "have
given all the advantages to the bel?
li gereit and have shown little regaid
for the rights of neutrals," was sug?
gested by Secretary Lansing as one
pf the first duties of the newly form
Ad. American Institute of International
law, in a letter sent by the secretary
^oday to Dr. James Brown Scott, pres?
ident of the institute.
Mr. Lansing- is one of the five Unit?
ed States members of the institute,
which was organized during the Pan
American Scientific Congress here, and
in which all of the American Repub?
lics are represented. His letter said*
j "At the first meeting of the insti?
tute I had the honor to direct at?
tention to the imperfect code of rules
^Phich define and govern the rela?
tions between belligerents and neu?
trals. These rules, which have
j grown up during the past one hun?
dred and twenty-five years, and have
peon In some cases differently inter?
preted by courts of different countries,
have been frequently found inadequate
to meet new conditions of warfare,
and as a result every war has changed,
feiodifled or added to the rules, gener?
ally through the process of judicial
decisions.
?.TJhe prize courts of belligerent;)
Lhave thus become the interpreter of
belligerent rights and neutral obliga?
tions, and their interpretations cvi
ce an unconscious prejudice aris
from over-appreciation of the
s of the belligerent. Writers on
rnational law have relied upon
prize court decisions in dealing
the subject of neutrality so that
avo laid down rules formulated
> ^tl^ii.lilnnnniiul
of view. Thus judicial decisions, text
writers, and international agreements
have given all the advantages to the
belligerent and have shown little re?
gard for the rights of neutrals.
"It would appear that it is time
to reverse this process of treatment of
the 3ubjoct of neutrality and to deal
with It from the point of view of the
^neutral. I would, therefore, suggest
that a committee be appointed to
study the problem of neutral rights
and neutral duties, seeking to formu?
late in terms the principle underlying
the relations of belligerency to neu?
trality rather than the express rules
governing the conduct of a nation at
war to a nation at peace.
I "In view of the past year and a
half of war the present time seems
particularly opportune to study this
question and this institute being
composed of members from neutral
nations is especially fitted to do this
from the proper point of view and
with the definite purpose of protect?
ing the liberty of neutrals from un?
justifiable restrictions on the high
seas and from the imposition of need?
less burdens In preserving their neu?
trality on land."

TELLS OF TREATMENT OF Da ^

PITAL.
Shows Expenses Wliich Were Iucurred
in Making Necessary Changes, af?
ter Conditions at South Carolina
and Other Institutions Had Been
j Contrasted?Much Benefit for Pa
| tients by Special Courses of Treat
I ment.
Columbia, Jan. 15.?"Upon assum?
ing the duties of superintendent on
May 1, 1916, a study was immediate?
ly begun to ascertain the most urgent
needs of the hospital and how to meet
them. In contemplating this prob?
lem, two objects have been kept prom- |
inently in view, namely, the better j
care and treatment of the patients
and the conserving of the approprla- 1
tlon for gross maintenance, expend- '
ing it to the greatest advantage pos?
sible for the patients." j
This paragraph at the outset of the
annual report of Dr. C. Fred Williams,
superintendent of the State Hospital
for the Insane, is the keynote of the
entire report, which is 16 printed
pages, and is accompanied by the re?
port of the board of regents and the
architect and the statistical matter
covering something like 100 pages ad?
ditional.
Dr. Williams tells of visiting hos?
pitals in other sections of the coun?
ty and finding that "the undesirable
features of the South Carolina State
Hospital contrasted strongly with the
better features of the hospitals visit?
ed, and the needs of our hospital wero
very apparent." He enumerates over?
crowding, dark unhygienic wards, in?
adequate sanitary arrangements, etc.
After a careful consideration, the
j most urgent needs appeared first to be
the remodelling of the wards for white
male patients where the lack of bath?
ing and toilet facilities and the neces?
sity for open wards and day rooms
was clearly seen; second, a congre?
gate dining room for white women pa?
tients, thus relieving, to a large ex?
tent; the overcrowded condition in
I jlsfrcsfrs****^ .h^ssMyerrinsj
the numerous small ward dining
rooms into ward space, also giving a
more economical and efficient method
of feeding the patients; fourth, the
need of a sanitary dairy; fifth, a cen?
tral heating plant and modern laun?
dry machinery.
Dr. Williams then enumerates some
of the difficulties encountered in car?
rying into effect the policy stated.
First was the serious drawback of the
lack of water at State Park, necessi?
tating the removal of 100 patients to
the main hospital until that deficiency
could be corrected. He also describes
the expense necessitated in trying to
Improve the conditions. He declares
that much of the furniture was dilap?
idated and that there was a general
atmosphere of barrenness ahd that the
patients had to use their beds for
lounging places in the day, making
the wards untidy and increasing the
expense of the laundry.
The patients have lived up to the
word patient and have cooperated with
j the management and have endured all
i hardships rendered necessary by the
crowded conditions.
Dr. Williams after reciting briefly
the progress in tho last 100 years in
the treatment of mental disorders,
tells of the reorganization of the med?
ical staff of the hospital and describes
the daily meetings of the medical of?
ficers of the State hospital. All en?
trance examinations are typewritten
and are submitted at these meetings
for discusion as to the proper treat?
ment for the patients. The progress
and possible cure of the individual
patients are also discussed and the
hospital has a systematic way of ac?
knowledging letters from relatives of
inmates. This requires a great
amount of time.
Tho hospital is getting away from
the use of drugs and requires patients
to rest as much as possible and hydro
therapy or the use of hot and cold
water packs, compresses and baths is
also practiced to a great extent. The
question of diet is Also given great
consideration, especially With pella
grins.
Cases of pulmonary troubles are
isolated and treated apart from the
'other patients and major operations
'are performed without charge by sur?
geons who are called in for that pur?
pose. One of the most important
thorapeutlo agencies is light occupa?
tion lor the patients Who can "work.
A great variety of forms of occupation
is provided and there were 782 pa?
tients at work at tho institution in
(October.
Dr. Williams calls attention to the
condition of the feeble-minded and
epileptics, saying that thev should be
provided lor in some special manner.
He tells of the effect of recreation

There is a mass Of other detailed
and highly interesting information in
the report which cannot be discussed
in a I rief synopsis, but the purport of
it all Is to the effect that efficiency
and economy are being aimed at. and
while the organization is not now per?
