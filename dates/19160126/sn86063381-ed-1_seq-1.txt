BEMIDJI REST ROOM
HAS HAD REMARKABLE
RECORD DURING 3 YEARS
Bemidji's rest room, besides mak
ing a remarkable record since its es
(iiblishment three years ago, has
caused much favorable comment and
lias been the basis of not a few stor
ies in farm magazines. From the
lirst month that it was placed in op
era! ion the patrons have increased
I'roiu 200 to :}f)0 per month.
Began Three Years Ago.
Three years ago the matter of hav
ing a rest room for the farmers and
out-of-town shoppers came to the at
tention of the merchants. People
would drive in from the country or
come by railway, do their shopping
and as there was no other place
to go, would be compelled to stand
around in the stores.
Backed by Study Club.
The matter was first taken up by
the Merchants association, was turn
ed over by them to the Commercial
club and after lengthy discussions
the matter was dropped in that or
ganization. Finally the Woman's
Study club took up the proposition.
The plan was and is financed by
the city council and the business men.
Ten dollars is set aside each month
by the city for its maintenance. The
balance is furnished by thirty mer
chants. The Woman's Study club
has collected this money each month.
Rent $35 and $40 a Month.
In opening the room, the terms
were set at $30 a month. After the
first year, the rates were increased
to $35 and $40. The difference in
rent is due to the heavy winter and
light summer expense.
The first year over 2,500 farm
ers and shoppers visited the room.
Although there is no register at the
present time, about 350 people visit
the rooms each month. During the
past year there were no less than 4r
200 callers.
From Many Points.
Among these have been people from
Kansas, Iowa, Montana, Illinois,
North Dakota and in fact almost
every state in the union. The ma
jority of people, however, are farm
ers from the neighboring towns, such
as Frohn, Liberty, Eckles, Northern
j.ml the villages cf Puposky, Nebish
."iul Turtle River.
Houses Are Rented.
Through the rest room many farm
ers' boys and girls have found posi
tion? to earn board and room while
nt lending school. Vacant houses
have been located for out-of-town
people.
Articles in Papers.
That the rest room is practical
mid a gcod feature for this city is
shown by the numerous articles and
inquiries which Mrs. F. Thompson,

Is Also Fined $100 Was Arrested in
This City June 23, 1915, by
Federal Officers.
Ole Anderson, formerly propri
etor of the Lake Shore hotel in this
city and who was found guilty in the
United States district court of intro
ducing liquor into the Indian treaty
district, was yesterday given a sen
tence on that charge of seven months
in the Otter Tail county jail and a
fine of $100. Judge Page Morris of
Federal court passed the sentence.
Funkley is Attorney.
Attorney H. Funkley of this city
represented Mr. Anderson at Fergus
Falls yesterday.
On June 23, 1915, Ole Anderson
was arrested by Deputy United States
Marshal Frank Tufts on a complaint
sworn out by C. E. Benson, special
officer in the United States Indian
service, charging that on June 8,
1915, Mr. Anderson introduced into
Indian country at Bemidji, six quarts
of whisky.
Out on $1,000 Bail.
He was arraigned before Judge H.
A. Simons, United States commis
sioner, and through his attorney,
Henry Funkley, entered a plea of not
guilty. He demanded a hearing,
which was set for June 30, 1915. At
that time after the evidence in the
case had been heard, he was bound
over to the federal grand jury which
met at Fergus Falls on Nov. 9, 1915.
He gave bail to the sum of $l,0t)0
and was released upon his own re
cognizance.
Is Convicted.
At the November term of the
United States district court he was
tried by jury and convicted of the
charge. Sentence was deferred pend
ing an appeal, the argument of which
was to have been asked at some date
prior to yesterday. The appeal was
abandoned and a sentence asked for
by the defendant.
An application was made at the
January term of court to have the
case taken up and disposed of at that
time. The court, however, ruled that
action could not be taken as the sen
tence had to be imposed within the
district that the defendant had been
convicted. Hence the action at Fer
gus Falls yesterday.
Packed in Can.
This is the celebrated "milk can"
case in which the defendant is ac
cused of shipping six quarts of whis
ky to this city from Leonard in a
ten-gallon milk can. The liquor was
packed in a large milk can and was
kept from rattling or breaking by the
use of excelsior. The excelsior and
bottled goods were then covered over
by a mixture of water and condensed
milk.
Milk Leaks Out.
Detection was due to the fact that
the can leaked and when it arrived
in this city the fluid covering the
pack'ing and bottles had disappeared,
leaving the necks of the bottles pro*
jecting above the packing,
