ANGER.
Anger is a most harmful emotion.
In fact, very few are aware how
frightfully dangerous it is to the av
erage person. There is on record
this
saying of a great doctor: "He
is
man very rich indeed in phys
ical power who can affdd to be
angry."
NEEDLESS FEARS
The following from the Christ
ian Science Monitor, Boston,
Mass., of the fifth inst., is a fine
description of what fear is, or
rather, of a certain kind of fear.
The editor of The Press gets into
an argument with his neighbors
ever*: time a case of so-called epi
demic disease breaks out, over the
need or necessity of extreme quar
antine measures. Luckily, he hos
not got any doctors among his
neighbors but if he had, we wish
it thoroly understood, we would
compl}7 with every order or direc
tion of the doctor. We insist,
however, with everybody else that
it is not all necessary to impose
such a quarantine on a person that
it will interfere with his business,
in this day of disinfectants and fu
mignnts.
"When a country picks up its
morning newspaper, and finds it is
in the verjT grip of a dreaded dis
ease when it reads column after
column, explaining in statistics,
eloquent hpyond words, the failure
of the medical profession to dfid
with the existing epidemic when
case after case is detailed for its
edification, with the fullest delin
eation of symptoms, then every
body knows what is likely to occur.
It begins to look for "symotomV
and it is not slow in finding them.
The "symptoms" rapidly develop
according to the fear of the pa
tient, or the impression which has
been made upon him by the men
tal picture. lie finds himse'f
steadily growing worse,and all his
friends and relatives prepare to
fear the worst. That is how the
careful dissemination of the rec
ord of au epidemic, built up on
sensational statements, grows into
being. The course is exactly like
Beaumarchais' 'Evolution of Scan
dal':
'k 'An epidemic, sir! You c1©
not. realize what you are despising.
I have seen the most respectable
persons nearly overwhelmed by it.
At first, alight sound, skimm'ng
the earth like a swallow before the
storm, very softly (pianissimo) it
murmurs and purrs, and sows in
its course poisoned arrows. It is
on so nebody's mouth, and softly,
softly (piano, piano) it glides slyly
into your ear. The evil-is done.
It is born, it creeps, it walks and
with growing power (rinforzando)
it «*ocs from mouth to mouth.
Then,
on a sudden,—I cant tell
you how—you see it straighten up,
hiss,
swell, and grow tall, before
your very eyes. It springs,
stretches its wings, whirls, envel
ops,
seizes, carries off it flashes
lightning, it thunders, and be
comes a hue and cry, a public
crescendo, a universal chorus.'
"Yet it is the Christian era, and
the founder of Christianity said,
These signs shall follow them
that believe they shall lay
hands on the sick and they shall
recover.'"

0!d "Jitney Bus" Replaced by New
Ford Car
It looks a little again as if Fin
est City was going to try
"pick itself up by its hoot
siraps." Anyhow, we are assur
ed of having a decided improve
ment over the kind of a "jitney
bus" that we had last year.
Forest Gates announces that he
now has a real, new, Ford car,
and is prepared to do a general
auto-livery business.

PRUNE TREES IN SUMMER
Farmers Trim in Foliage 8eason in
Order to Check Wood
Growth.
Summer pruning, as contrasted with
the regular practice, is the pruning of
trees while in foliage. Its influence
upon the tree in many respects is oppo
site to winter pruning. The latter
stimulates wood growth, while the for
mer tends to lessen wood growth.
As a rule, any practice that checks
wood growth tends to induce fruitful
ness. Growers have taken advantage
of this fact for many years. In Eng
land the result is attained by root
pruning. The method consists in dig
ging a trench around the tree at some
considerable distance and severing
some of the roots. This interferes
with the food supply and necessarily
reduces growth.
In the famous Ozark apple region
of Missouri and Arkansas the same
result is attained by ringing or gir
dling the trunk or main branches of
the tree, thus checking the downward
flow of sap. The roots in this way are
partially starved and are, therefore, un
able to induce a strong wood growth
the following Beason. The work is
done during the growing season and,
as a result, the wound soon heals over.
A complete or partial defoliation by
insects, disease, or spraying injury dur
ing the early summer seems to have
the same effect.—Farm and Home.
CITY MANAGER PLAN GROWS
The Commission Form of City Govern
ment Being Carried a Step
Forward.
Though the so-called commission
form of municipal government had its
origin in Galveston, Iowa has done
much to popularize the idea. The Des
Moines plan of commission rule, which
is a modification of the Galveston plan,
has been much advertised. Several
other cities of Iowa have the same sys
tem in operation.
The city manager plan, which is
simply the commission plan carried a
step further, is believed by many to
represent the best thought on the sub
ject of city government. Under this
plan the commission chooses an execu
tive officer to carry out its policies and
holds him responsible for results ob
tained, whereas under the simple com
mission plan the commissioners divide
the administrative responsibility
among themselves, each commissioner
taking the headship of a department of
municipal service.
Iowa has shown its progressiveness
by making it possible for cities of that
state to add the city manager feature
to the commission plan. An enactment
of the legislature at its recent sessions
permits cities governed by commis
sions to adopt the city manager feature
by popular vote.
