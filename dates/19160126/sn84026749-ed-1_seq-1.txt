STATE RESTS
MOHR CASE:
WIDOW TO GIV
STORY TODAY
Attempt to Dismiss Indictment
Fails Last State Witness
' Unshaken Under Cross-Examination
by Lewis.
Testimony to Defend Brown and
Spellman Will Not Be Com
bined With That Offered by
Defense of Mrs. Mohr.
PROVIDENCE, R. I., Jan. 26.
The State rested its case in the
trial of Mrs. Elizabeth Mohr
shortly after noon today.
The defense will open immedi
ately and it is expected Mrs.
Mohr will be the first witness.
Captain Monahtm, of Providence,
occupied the witness stand dur
ing the morning session and fol
lowing the end of his examination
Attorney General Rice turned the
casd'over to the defense.
Attorney Arthur M. Cushing,
Mrs. Mohr's counsel, immediately
moved that the indictment be dis
missed on the ground that , one
person, not three,ppmmittedthe
murder. The court overruled him.
4tST&TE'S tAST WITNESS.
The jury waa dismissed from the
loom .during the presentation of the
motions.
Captain Monahan, on cross-examination,
was unshaken In his story.
The officer told the story of the
morning of September 2 whon, the
State claims, both Brown and Spell
nuin confessed they were responsible
for the shooting-, and that they did
It at Mrs. Mohr's request and for he.r
gold.
"Spollman was the first to implicate
Mrs. Mohr," he testified "and waa
first or the two to admit that they
hot from ambush at the doctor's
car."
It is understood thnt Mrr. Mohr'a
counsel will content themselves with
a general denial of the story toltl bv
Georgo W. Henlls and of the so-called
t'onfesslons of Brown and Spellman,
although the defense apparently has
vlllinly allowed much evidence to
go In to the effect that Mrs. Mohr had
Mifflclon cause to bo Jealous of the
physician's actions, and possibly
enough to loso all the love aho once
had for him.
Mrs. Mohr's self-control has been al
most unshaken.
On only one occasion, when a young
assistant attorney scneral threw 'the
crimson stained clothlnjr of her dead
hurband on the floor of the court, has
sho Klvcn way to tears. But even then
she recovered quickly, and fifteen min

Congressman Bailey Introduces
Bill That Would Let Women
of District Vote.
nirctlon of members of tho Board
of Education by the citizens of the
District cif Columbia Is proposed In a
bill Introduced today by Congressman
Bailey of Pennsylvania, a 'Democratic
member of tho Ilojise District Com
mittee. The nalley bill provides that for the
purported of the school board election
tho frnnchl.se shall bo extended to
women as well at men. hut that nil
electors shall have resided In the
Pistrlct one year before being allowed
to vote. The voters must also be
twenty-one ycais of bko or oioic.
It la proposed that the elec'ons shall
be held in tbe school bulldlnKs ami
thnt Congress shall prescribe the time
and manner of elections and the terms
of oifico of members of the board. Con
gress would nlso appropriate Tor the
election expenses.

For "Principal Groups"
System in the Schools
A plan for naming "gioup principals"
for a number of Washington schools lo
cated near each other, and thus creating
larger school unlti under one super
vision, will bo outlined to the Board 01
Kducation at Its meeting this aftet
noon by Ernest L. Thurston, superin
tendent of schools.
This plan marks one of the most Im
portant proposals hi recent years for a
change in the method of supervising
.'chools. It Is the reault ot Iour and
caieful lUudy of a method to ovcicomo
the handicap of the many small elght
lonm buildings in Washington.
The Thompson and Franklin schools
now afford the only example where this
plan has been trlrd. These schools,
within n block of each other, have been
conducted by one principal mo success
fully that .he believes they furnish an
example of what might be done all over
the city wlieie schools are within short
distances of each other.
Though Mr. Thurston declined to give
the names of the schools which might
be affected bv the pioposal, In advance
of his lecommendatlon to the board,
some of the groups which aie rightly
located for such an experiment are the
Johnson, Powell, and Johnson annex;
the Polk and Henry, the Towers and
Wallach, and the Jefferson and Aml
don. It alo Is understood that Mr. Thurs
ton's plan Is not to have a non-tencu-Ing
principal lor these groups, but so
to lighten tho teaching woik ot tne
principal that he or she will be able to
give more time to the work done by
teachers !n lower grades.
The plan also, in the case of schools
within a block ot each other, would
afford an opportunity for sending all
smaller children to one school ami
older children to the others, thus facil
itating playground and administrative
work.

at her home. Ii wus the first
f a series of social weirare lunch
eons, at which plans for the better
ment and as!Mancc of the unemploy
ed aro to be discussed.
The subject was "t nemployment,"
(he principal spenkej being William
Alhertl Writing, former superinten
dent of tho municipal lodging house,
who piosentcd the problem of tho
employable nnd the unemployable,
after which there wns a general dis
cussion on the bails of Mr. Whiting's

This Wihtcr's Problem.
The meeting wa held for the pur
pose of considering the need of de
veloping work supplemental to- thnt
of tho municipal lodging house and
to co-oneratc with other work now
being carried on by the mayor's com
mission and other organizitlons. It
grew out of some problems that arose
last winter in connection with the
Iiundl .'Jay and the gieat unemploy
ment in New Vol It At that time nn
ndvisory committee was formed to
work with tho lodging house in its
f-oeial relief work, but it was found
that certain limitations ot the char
ter In the matter of giving outdoor
relief made It Impossible to do this
work as largely as the city would
lii.e to do.
The problem this winter, with the
percentage of unemplo ment very much
smuller, 's that of separating the un
employable from the employable, to
take care of homeless men who are out
of work for the first time, and who are
not properly subjects for city care or
charity.
It Is planned to open shops for skilled
and unskilled labor, and to conduct a
sales store.

German Ambassador Smiling
and Affable as He Leaves
State Department After Xalk
With Lansing ,
Feels Confident That Present
Deadlock Will Be Relieved
Within a Week Refuses to
Make Statement.
Secretary of State Lansing to"
day delivered to Count von Bern
storff for transmission to Berlin
the final proposals of the UnitcB
States for settlement of the Lus:
tnnia case.
Count von Bernstorff was
closeted with the Secretary for
about thirty-five minutes. Arriving
at the State Department at 1 1 :45,
it was about 12:20 when he left.
He was smiling and affable, but
declined to make any comment.
It was learned, however, that the
ambassador feels confident that
the present deadlock will be re
lieved within a week. This confi
dence, it is believed, is based op
the intention, of the ambassador
strongly to advise his government
to meet the wishes of the United
States.
CARRIED PAPER.
As hes- entered his limousine the Am
bassador was flngciing a folded piece
of letter paper, which is believed to
have contained Secretary Lansing'-,
views of the kind of agreement which
Germany should make. Nevertheless, it
was stated that Mr. Lansing had not
presented to the ambassador any foi
mal memorandum containing tho pro
posals of this Government
After stepping out of the Secretary's
office the ambassador remained a few
moments In the ante-room, where ho
dhtated a communication ot some son
to Sir. Lansing's private stenographer
This Is understood to have been a com
munication which he ambassador de
sired to send to hla government by
wireless, and which, under tho rulesv
the State Department censorship, mu:fv
pass through the department
Arrangements were made that Anl
bassador von Bernstorff should ejflfiU
this communication to his government
Immediately over State Departmei
wires. Nothing further will be dons
until Berlin Is heard irom.

Count von Bernstorff waited in tlib

diplomats discussed the submarine
question brlelly.
Secretary Lansing and the Gernnu
ambassador refused to discuss the L-tisl-tanla

tion Is now up to Herlln and there !

Last Word of.U. S.
While In the nature of a counter pro
posal, since the plan of settlement re
jected yesterday was submitted by the
Herlln government, the communication
that will go forward today Is expected
to be tbe last word of the United States
The German proposals have rcpeatedb
cvadeel the qui stion of admitting tho il
legality of the Lubitanla attack. The
United States is insisting on an ex
plicit and not an implied disavowal of
responsibility for the Lusltanla attack'
This Is the onl question over which
there Is disagreement. The German pro
posals agree to pay full Indemnity for
American lives and property loss. Jju,
even In expressing Its willingness tee
pay Iniiemnltj tho German government
m Its pioposals, rejected by the Unltefl
States yesterday, refused to admit lin
legal liability to pay such Indemnity
Distinct Disappointment.
There was ellstlnct'-dlsappolntment ln
official and diplomatic quarters over
failure of the negotiations for settle
ment of tho Lusitanta case. Th
friendly tone of Berlin dispatches haet
encouraged officials in the belief that
Germany would meet the main demands
of the L nlted States.
It will be at least ten days longer be
fore a reply can be received from Bei
lln to the new proposals to go feyward
today, ln the view of -diplomatic offi
cials. Meanwhile Ahc new delay ln tlv
Lusltanla negotiations may cause a
postponement of tho dlplomatlo Intei
