Columbia.-Speakers addressing the
conference held in Columbia under the
auspices of the South Carolina State
Farmers' Union stressed the necessity
of organization and co-operation
among the farmers and business men

sources are to be developed to the
highest point. Practically every coun

meetings, which were held in the
chapel my the University of South
Carolina. H. T. Morrison of Char
leston county, president of the union,
presided at the sessions.
President Morrison made a short
opening talk emphasizing the great
necessity of organization and co-opera
tion among the farmers. He gave
some instances of actual co-operation.
The Citrus Growers' association of
southern California, he said, has been
doing a very large business on a very
small paid up capital. "Carloads of
oranges," he said, "are sold while
rolling. Fruit is sold through the
agency for..the benefit of all its mem
bers, thereby securing the benefits of
genuine co-operation." An outline of
t the work of the Scott County Cotton.
Growers' association in Arkansas was
sketched by the speaker, giving their
plan of co-operative- selling of cotton
and cotton seed and showing advan
tages of same to the individual mem'
bers. ' Instances of the loss to the
farmer through lack .of information
and lack of co-operation were given by
Mr. Morrison.
Passage of a series of resolitions
intended to aid in the betterment of
agricultural conditions in the state
market were adopted at the night ses

Washinltoh Government . Knew 01
' ians of Rebels But Depended on
Carranza For Safety.
Was i tan.-Death to Americans
in I~eaco, and destruction of their
pro ..,vell as war to a finish
against Cagganza, was determined
upon, It has just became known, at a
formal convention of the Mexican rev
olutionary leaders held in November
at a ranch near Cordoba. Present and
joining in the agreement are said to
haveb eenr epresentatives o f Villa,
3 Zapata,A rgumedo, Higinio Aguallar,
the Cedillo brothers and many lesser
chieftians.
Meager reports of this gathering
came to the state department long1
ago but they were not made public
i and until. this time few people in
Washington knew that there was a
general conspiracy against Americans,
or even that the various rebel fac
tions in the field in Mexico had
effected. any kind of an agreement for
t concerned activities against the de
t facto government.
) The zmassacre at Santa Ysabel, at
! tributed to bandits led by Villa of
r ficers, is believed to have been per
1 petrated in accordance with the rebel
convention order. Officials think the
long period that passed after the Cor
doba meeting before the murders was
because of the time required by the
various delegates to make reports to
their 'commanders, and the fact that
r the news of the convention's decision
had to be carried to subordinate mili
tary commanders by courier. Cor
doba is on the railroad between -Vera
t Cruz and Mexico City and some 1,000
t miles from Santa Ysabel.
The'Carranza authorities have been
fully advised concerning the move
ments' of the rebels and have been
depended upon by the Washington
government to take every possible pre
cautioh to prevent the threats against
Amerkans from being carried out.
They'tre- believed to have the situa
tion fiirly well in hand now, although
9 the- chiefs :whose delegates met at
Cordoba still are in the field, operat
e ing more or less openly.

Stripes for Violators.
The general assembly of South
Carolina, the lower house especially,
seems determined to put stripes on
the person violating any law of the
state relating to the sale, shipment
or st -rage of intoxicants. By a large
majority, 71 to 18, the lower branch
refused to kill Mr. Liles' bill providing
for a chaingang sentence without the
alternative of a fine. Debate on the
measure began early in the afternoon
and was resumed at night. Indications
point to the final enactment of the
bill, as it is said that there is little
objection to "making prohibition pro
hibit" to be found among the mem
bers of the senate. A number of
amendments to the Liles bill were
proposed, but only those introduced
by the author himself were passed,
each of the others meeting instant
death at the hands of a determined
body of legislators. The bill provides
for a ch.'igang sentence of three
months to five years for the first of
fense and one year to five years for
each subsequent offense. No option
of a fine is given a presiding judge.
The bill also carries a provision that
a circuit judge may suspend all of
the imprisonment except 30 days for
the first offense and 60 days for the
second offense; in any instance the
person convicted must serve at least
30 days. The bill does not apply to
cases now pending in courts or to
offenses committed prior to the en
actment of the act, should It pass.
Dispensary Stock
A bill which provides a plan for
the disposal of stocks in the recently
closed dispensaries was introduced in
the senate by Senators Banks, Lide,
Sinkler and Spigner. The general
plan Is to open the dispensaries so
that the surplus stock may be re
tailed under the provisions of the
gallon-a-month law, which becomes ef
fective the first of the year, and to
keep them open until all liquors have
been sold. Sales are to be made only
at the county seats in the 15 coun
ties which went dry January 1. It is
estimated that approximately $100,
000 worth of whiskey was brougbt
over.
No Whiskey "Ads"
The temper of the upper house to
ward positive anti-liquor legislation
was indicated when the Carlisle bill,
making the advertisement of liquors
In newspapers or on bill-boards ai
misdemeanor, passed third reading
and was sent to the house without a
dissenting voice. During the rapid
transit of the bill through the sen
ate no opposition whatever was de
veloped .Violation of the measure Is
punishable by a fine of not more than
$500 or less than.$100.
Enforcement Fund;
The big exception to the policy of
retrenchment has been .the indorse
ment by the ways and means com
mittee of the bill providing for a fund
of $50,000 for the enforcement of the
prohibition and- gallon-a-month laws.
Withal it is expected that the state
levy will be kept down to six mills.
A number of bills on taxation pres
age the fight that has been freely
predicted. The latest rumor, how
ever, is that opposition to the South
Carolina tax commission will not
come to a head, the fight being con
fined to the methods to be pursued In
.he assessment and equalization of
property. Various measures and joint
resolutions proposing constitutional
amendments have been introduced,
debate on which will hardly matdrial
ize until after many of the contented
matters left from the 1915 session
have been disposed or.
Discuss Warehousing.
The South Carolina cotton ware
housing systeD will also come in for
discussion as It Is understood that a
bill will be introduced along the lines
suggested in Gov. Manning's annual
message, providing for a board of

TESTING A SHELL
Ordeals Through Which a Big Gun
Missile Must Pass.
THE SOFT NOSE PROJECTILE,
Its Ability to Bore Its Way Through
Heavy Armor Plate Without Explod
ing Until After Its Impact Was Dis
covered by Ac-ident.
Everybody knows that the modern
shell is one of the most diabolical of
man's inventions, but how many of us
realize that it is also one of the most
delicate and complicated?
tereutly some firms holding- con
tracts for making high explosive shells
took upon themselves to "correct" a
detail in the specification, and, as a re
sult, a certain thread was "improved."
They will never do anything of the
kind again, because all their work was
rejected. The apparent absurdity-it
is, in fact. an absolute absurdity, from
an engineering point of view-is de
signed of set purpose..
There is a somewhat similar anom
aly in the big shell for penetrating
armor plating. which was introduced
in consequence of an accident. One
day a test shell was fired at a piece of
armor plating from the soft side, and
the projectile went clean .through it
and exploded after impact, whereas a
similar shell fired against the front
the hardened and tempered side-shat
tered and left an indentation of only a
few inches.
This singular incident set somebody
thinking. and in consequence the high
explosive armor piercing shell is now
given a soft nose. To the hard point is
attached a cap of soft metal. with
which addition it will go through the
toughest piece of armor plate. What
happens on impact seems to be this:
The cap spreads.-holding the point and
so enabling it-remember that the shell
is revolving rapidly-to force its-was
unbroken through the hard face of the
plate by a sort of boring action.
No less curious is another fact con
cerning the points of such projectiles.
After the heads have been worked the
shells are left for weeks before they
undergo the next stage, because, strong
as they look. they are liable to snap.
Why? Think of the razor. Constant
stropping twists the grain, with the re
sult that the steel gets "tired" and will
not yield a keen edge. But if you put
the thing away for a few weeks the
grain Vl' return to its normal state,
and you can get a satisfactory shave
In a similar way the grain of the steel
is affected by working. though of course
to a much greater'extent, and until it is
"set" the makers must go cautiously.
Steel shows a like eccentricity in the
making of test gauges.-,A}e. of-4be
measurements. of shells are very fine,
and the instruments employed. are so
delicate that, they have to be used
quickly lest the heat of the hand causes
the metal to expand.
Now. when a groove is cut In a piece
of steel which is to be used as a test
gauge the work is laid aside for weeks,
perhaps months. Why not finish it at
once? Because the groove. though dead
true when cut out, may be otherwise in
a short time, even though it has been~
absolutely untouched..
As a concrete proof of the elaborate
nature of projectile making take the
case of .the shrapnel shell. -'The steel
portion undergoes about a seore of op
erations, a~nd the brass cartridge case
attached to the base requires about six.
teen, counting from the disk of sheel
brass to the finished article. Theea
ttiere is the fuse, the delicacy of whici
resembles watchmaking.
Altogether the shell Is subjected .te
about forty Inspections and may be re
jected at-any stage.
After a shell has survived this ordeal
it ought to be, one would think,. per.
feet. but a test shell is taken fron
every 120 and actually fired from a gut
into a bank of sand. It is then again
examined, and if the contour about the
powder pocket is expanded away goes
the whole batch, because if they were
fired the grooving might be torn out of
the gun..
Perhaps the most striking illustration
of the minute care exercised in projec
tile making is that every shell is weigh
ed over and over again. If you produce
an eisahteen pounder high explosive
shell it must be only a few drains over
or under its normal weight;. otherwise
it is rejected.. -
In this connection It may be of Inter
est to note that an explosive shell that
weighs only about seventy pounds will
break into a shower of some 1,200
pieces. A single one of the monster
proectiles fired from a fifteen Inch na
val gun will weigh 1,950 pounds. It
takes twelve seconds for the 'projectile
of a twelve inch naval gun to reach Its
point of impact when firing at a range
of five miles. To fire a' battleship
broadside costs about $20,000.- Ex
