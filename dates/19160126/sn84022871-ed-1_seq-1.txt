Congregational Church Notes.
Rawson Calkins, the delegate from
the Sunday school to the ' Older Boys'
conference, recently held in Rutland,
gave a very interesting report Sunday
evening. Gustavus Burdick who was
present at a part of the conference,
also spoke of the work.
Methodist Episcopal Church Notes.
Election of a lay delegate from this
church to attend the conference of lay
delegates from other churches, to be
held at Montpelier in connection with.
the annual Vermont conference in
April, will be held at the church Fri
day evening Feb 11. The ladies of
the Alliance will also hold their regular
monthly social and supper at that
time. All members over 21 years are
entitled to vote and it is hoped every
one who can will be present.
The subject of the morning sermon
was "Living Dogs and Dead Lions,"
the text being found in Eccles. 9:4
The dog was considered as mean and
contemptible but the lion stood for
power and was admired. Many help
ful lessons were drawn from the text.
The smallest and apparently most in
significant things rightly used are
better than great things unimproved.
God can use willing nobodies. We
need a willingness to use what we
already have rather than to have more.
The thing of moment is whaj: we do
with today. The simple act of kind
ness done is far better than many
promises for the future.
The evening lesson was the parable
of the Good Samaritan and from it
practical suggestions were brought to
us. Our neighbor is not simply the
person who Jives next aoor, out we
should count every man our brother.
no matter what the color of his skin
may be, and we snouia ao unto our
neighbor as we would have him do
unto us .

Concert Grand Success.
The high schopl concert and literary
entertainment given in Seaver's opera
hall last evening as the fourth number
of the Barton lecture course, was a
decided success. The hall was well
filled and every number was most
enthusiastically received and encored.
The singing of the boys' and girls'
glee clubs showed much careful train
ing as did the readings and other num
r?ers of the program. Great crenit is
due Miss Edith Ruggles and Miss Kate
Ferrin, who had the entertainment in
charge.
Prospect Pomona Meeting at Iraeburg.
Ninety-six members of Prospect
Pomona Grange, representing Granges
at -Charleston, Brownington, Glover
and Barton, met at Irasburg Thursday,
Jan 32. They were royally entertained
by the members of Black River Valley
Grange of Irasburg, in their commodi
ous hall, the meeting being called to
order at 11 o'clock by the Pomona
master, R. F. Mason of Barton The
morning was devoted to the business of
the Grange and ways and means for its
welfare were discussed by itf? mem
bers. Of the noon hour we do not
ned to report, as anyone who has ever
attended a banquet at Irasburg knows
what the ladies can do in that line.
We will simply say that the members
from the other Granges did not shirk
their duty at that time and ample
justice was done to the bountiful
repast set before them.
The Grangers assembled at about
1 30 and after a few preliminaries 22
candidates were found in waitine- to
receive the fifth degree and as there
was other work which would take all
i he time of this session the work of
this degree was omitted and the
candidates were given the obligation
by State Master W. N. Cady. of Mid
dlebury, whom the Grange had the
honor to have with them for the day.
The real feature of the afternoon
was the installing of the following
officers, who had been elected at a
previous meeting held at Brownington :
M aster, W. G. Dutton ; overseer, C. T.
Metcalf; steward, B. J. Jenness;as
sistant steward, E. J. Caron ; lectur
er, Mrs. B. J. Jenness; chaplain,
Aaron Willey; gate-keeper, George
Calkins; secretary, Mrs. Elnora P.
Simpson; treasurer, Will May ; Pomo
na, W. G. Dutton ; Ceres, Mrs. C. T.
Metcalf : Flora, Mrs. George Kin
ney ; lady assistant steward, Mrs. E.
G. Caron. The installing officer was
State Master W. N. Cady, assisted by
Miss Mabel Dion of Irasburg Grange.
The work was done in a very pleasing
and impressive manner. Mr. Cady
always has his work committed, never
referring to a ritual and delivers his
charges in a manner that cannot help
impress upon the officers the duties
they have assumed. A committee
composed of Rev. G. L. Wells, Mrs.
E. G. Caron and Mrs. Will May, were
appointed to draft resolutions on the
death of a sister, Mrs. George Calkins.
Owing to the lateness of the hour no
literary program was presented but
many useiul hints and suggestions
were given by the state master. Iras
burg took the lead in number of mem
bers present but Irasburg seems to
be at the head in many good things at
present. Let other granges take pat
tern from her and follow in her steps.
At the closing of the session a rising
vote of thanks was given Black River
Valley Grange for the very efficient
manner in which the Pomona was
taken care of As we wended our way
home through the storm and wind
which closed the day, each member
felt repaid for the effort he had made
Let us strive to make each meeting as
successful as this. Next meeting with
Crystal Lake Grange at Barton March

THRIFT DAY.
A New Campaign to Institute Feb. 3d as
Annual Thrift Day.
There is at the present time being
conducted in this country a campaign
which is worthy of the deepest consid
eration by every man, woman and
rchild, because upon its successful
operation will depend our Increased
national, comumunity and individual
progress. It is the movement which
has been designed to bring into greater
evidence and practice everywhere the
inestimable quality of thrift a quality
which has more to do with ultimate
success than any other one factor. Be
fore the individual can be expected io
practice thrift, however, he must
understand in what it really consists.
Perhaps the foremost reason that the
word thrift is 'a distasteful one to the
ears of many of our citizens is that
for years in this country there has
been a general misconception of the
term. Thrift is not as many suppose,
niggardliness or stint in the necessities
and sane enjoyments of life, in reality,
it makes available more money tor the
things which make life really worth
while through the elimination of un
necessary and useless expenditure. It
is something more than saving, it
means "earning, working, plannirg
and increasing, as well as conserving."
It is common sense in actual opera
tion in every phase of human endeavor
and activity. Rightly understood, the
practice of thrift becomes a positive
pleasure, for it is a wise adaptation
of means toward a b neficent end
the constant maintenance of a fair
standard of comfort and an increase of
life's enjoyments and a lessened share
of its burdens with the flight of years.
John H. Senter of Montpeher Dies Sud
denly. John Henry Senter. one of the best
known attorneys in Vermont, and re
garded as one of the "war horses" of
the Democratic party in the state, died
suddenly Thursday evening at his
rooms in the Argus building, Mont
pplier. Mr. Senter appeared to have
been in his usual health and was on the
street that afternoon. His servant,
Dexter Grover, with whom he lived,
returning to Mr. Senter's apartments
at 7.30, discovered his employer lying
on the floor. He had evidently died
just after his evening meal. Physi
cians pronounced it a case of heart
failure, caused by acute indigestion.
Mr. Senter was born at Cabot, Nov. 11,
1848. He was for many years a director
and officer in the Union Mutual Fire
Insurance company. He was appoint
ed national bank examiner by President
Cleveland and on August 24, 1886, was
made commissioner of the United
States circuit court for the district of
Vermont, by Judge H. H. Wheeler. In
January, 1894, he was appointed by
President Cleveland United States dis
trict attorney for Vermont. He was a
delegate to the Democratic national
convention which nominated Cleveland,
and was a member of the national com
mittee from 1900 until 1904. In 1900
he was Democratic candidate for gov
ernor. He was state's attorney for
Washington county, 1903-4; member of
the state tax commission in 1896. He
was mayor of Montpelier in 1898 and
1899 and represented the city in 1906 in

Among the Speaker:
rs
At the annual banquet of the Ver

Mr. Hartness said in part: I come
to speak to you of a new Vermont;
a modern Vermont that is now in the
making. It will combine the splen
did characteristics of the past and
present with possibilities in the fu
ture that will make our state a lead
er in the essential things. There
has never been a time in the history
of Vermont when so many elements
were favorable to such a growth. My
life has been spent in the indus
tries. In this experience I have had
an opportunity to know first hand
how the workman thinks and feels.
I have observed the difference that
exists between the various sections
of this country and abroad with spe
cial attention directed at the devel
opment and growth of the industries
of Germany. During all this time I
have been actively connected with a
Vermont organization, and as a re
sult I see the great opportunity for
the Vermonter.
This is an age of mechanism, of
Invention and machinery. The gold
fields of today are right here in the
industrial states, where there is a
spirit of invention, of constructive
achievement and co-ordination of ef
forts. . CONTINUED ON PAGE TWO

REATEST WOMAN LECTURER. IN
AMERICA.
Anna C. M. Tillinghast of Beverly,
Mass., national lecturer for the W. C.
T. U.. who will sneak upon "The So-
called Advantages of the License Sys
tem, at Seaver's hall Friday even
ing, Feb. 4, at 8 o'clock is one of
ablest speakers in America. She is an
exception to the usual type of women
speakers in thst she puts things with
the force and logic of a man. In fact
there are few men who can equal her
upon the lecture platform. In Massa
chusetts in 1912-13-14. she toured the
state with Charles Sumner Bird and
Joseph Walker, gubernatorial candi
dates, speaking from two to five times
03y from the same platform with
them and men of national reputation,
to audiences running as high as 2000.
At debates in Boston where Mr. Bird
could not attend, by request of Mr.
Bird and the state committee, Mrs.
Tillinghast represented him, speaking
with judges, lawyers and legislators,
representing all the political parties
in the state, in the Maine campaign
for the retention of the prohibitory
amendment, Mrs. Tillinghast spoke ev
ery day for ten weeks, and is said to
have won as many, if not more votes
than any other single speaker. Mrs.
Tillinghast is. also interested in the
work of women's clubs. It was
through her influence that the State
Federation of Pennsylvania Women
raised a scholarship of domestic
science for the state college. Made
chairman of the committee to handle
the matter she devised the means of
raising the money and the method by
which the scholarship should be award
ed. She frequently lectures for the
club women of Massachusetts. Mrs.
Tillinghast has lived under high li
cense, local option and state prohibi
tion and knows whereof she speaks.
The voters of Barton and vicinity will
do well to hear what she has to say in
order that they may have more light
upon the liquor question.
Note the change in date to Friday
evening, Jbeb. 4.

Rev. C. O. Gill, Well Known in Orleans
County.
Papers have come to the Monitor
through a friend telling of the promin
ent part Rev. C. O. Gill, a former
pastor of the Westmore church, olayeci
m the recent great convention in
Columbus, O., of the Commission on
Church and Rural Life, a branch of the
Federal Council of Churches, attended
by some 400 delegates from every
part of the United States. President
Wilson was one of the speakers and it
was largely through Mr. Gill's influ
ence that the piesident was secured,
as Mr. Gill is a personal friend of Col.
E. M. House, President Wilson's
"chum" and personal representative
now in Europe. Mr. Gill was a college
classmate of Gifford Pinchot and the
two published a book some two vears
ago on "The Country Church" which
has received much attention and was
the means by which Mr. Gill became
personally acquainted with Theodore
Roosevelt. Mr. Gill directed a rural
church survey of the state of Ohio
recently and is secretary of the com
mission which held the great conven
tion mentioned above, having charge of
arranging the program.
Mr. Gill gained quite a wide acquain
tance in Orleans county during his
ministry in Westmore, having twice
served the Westmore church, first in
1894-5 and was one of the prime mov
ers in building the building, securing
the timber from land over which Mr.
Pinchot made a survey. In 1895 Mr.
Gill married Miss Mary Nelson, a home
missionary worker in Vermont and
Mr. and Mrs. Gill went to China as
missionaries. In 1899 Mr. Gill re
turned to the Westmore. cburcb, remain
ing until 1904. Rev. Mr. Gill was a
star football player when he was in
Yale, being captain of the 'varsity
team and playing upon the 'varsity
team every year of his college course.
It was during the Gill football regime
that Yale won its greatest laurels at the
game and his fellow students presented
him with a silver loving cup as a re
ward for .the star work of their
"preacher captain." He was promi
nent in other athletics as well. Mr.
Gill is now a resident of Columbus, O.,
and holds a prominent place as a rural
church expert. His success and the
story of his life is always interesting
to Orleans county people who came to
know both Mr. and Mrs. Gill so well.

interesting arithmetic lessons in the
first grade room.
A most interesting experience meet
ing was held in Room 18 Friday morn
ing. You really should have been
there.
In place of the old bulbs which had
bloomed themselves to death, new ones
have been planted and it is hoped will
be in bloom by Easter.
The training class did not hold its
regular session Thursday afternoon and
Friday as Miss Patrick was attending
a convention in Montpelier.
Principles of teaching geography,
observation, psychology, arithmetic.
English and music are now being stud
ied. The outlines for teaching music
have a start.
Physiology and hygiene are proving
interesting subjects and after class dis
cussions the girls feel that they with
the help of their outlines make it prac

What is the Training Class doing?
The class has started new bulbs for
Easter, a model doll house, chansred
their program for school subjects and
have their outlines for teaching physi

room Miss Patrick, Mary Maud.
The training class is taking up the
system of music which is used in the
grades. The plan is to introduce this
method of music into the rural schools
so as to give pupils the foundation for
their music when they shall have come
to high school.
"Oh, what a big box!' exclaimed a
freshman. "What are you going to do
with that?"
"It's to be used for a model doll
house, and the girls are to do the
work themselves. See the boards that
they have already taken off and the
work is now begun," said Nellie?

her grandchildren there. They are
better and she has returned.
What might, have been a very serious
accident happened Saturday evening
while the boys and girls were sliding.
Carlos Drown ' and Raymond Kimball
separated from the crowd and went
into the Annis yard running on the
stone wall to throw snow balls, when
one of the large split stones gave wy
with Raymond Kimball and came
down on his foot and ankle. It took
several men to pry the stone up enough
to pull the boy out. The soft, damp
snow probably saved broken bones.
