Basket Ball.
The Lindsey- Wilson Training School
defeated Shepherdsville High School
boys' team in basket ball by a score
of 104 to 3 here Friday night.
The team work of L. W. T. S. boys
was unexcelled in the last half when
they sometimes made as many as
three goals in a half minute.
The work of Jim Lewis in running
the floor and the work of Wesley in
getting the ball out of the mix-ups
had the opponents guessing. Cook
did effective work in the last half,
while Calhoun and Powers held the
S. H. S. boys safely at bay as guards
Reece and H. Popplewell who went
in the last half had both been sick in
bed last week, but did effective work.
The determination and grit exhibit
ed by L. W. T. S. girls' team has
made Lindsey no less proud of their
girls, especially as they defeated one
of the strongest teams of the State.
The game was exciting and bitterly
contested from the first, and Colum
bia won by sheer pluck and determi
nation. Saturday evening the male basket
ball team of Shepherdsville moved
over to the High School and played
the club of that institution before a
large crowd, the final score being 41
to 10 in favor of the local quintet.
"The visitors were clearly outclassed,
making only one field goal in the en
tire game. Shepherdsville was the
first to score making two points after
fouls, but the High School machine
soon began to work and they were
never headed. The playing of Lewis
featured.
Buys a Fne Farm.
Mr. Frank Hill, who is a brother of
Mr. Fred Hill, a druggist at this
place, purchased recently a fine 135
acre farm, known as "Plnewood," in
Fayette county, four miles from Lex
itgton. The Lexington Leader says
the farm is one of the show places of
Fayette county. Mr. Hill waa reared
in Columbia, but for a number of years
has been a citizen of Wayne county,
where he has been engaged in stock
raising. He will remove his cattle to
Fayette county and will continue to
buy and sell fine stock. The price of
the farm is not given, but it is under
stood to be big figures. Mr. and Mrs.
Hill will remove to their new possess
ions in February.
All parties indebted to Russell '&
ButooinpteaeaUtod settle thW&"a"

Russell & Eubank, r J
Married at the Parsonage.
Last Saturday afternoon Mr. E. S.
Rice, a very prominent farmer and
one of the best citizens of Adair coun
ty, whose home is in the Cane Valley
section, -and Miss Myrt Squires, a
.daughter of Mr. W. F. Squires one
of Adair county's best young women,
were married by Eld. Z. T. Williams,
at the home of the minister. It 'was
a very quiet affair.
W. T. Hodgeu, of Campbellsville,
who perhaps is the largest wild an
imal dealer in Kentucky, sent a repre
sentative here in the person of his son.
Ralph, last Wednesday, in a special
car, advertising for live rabbits, ask
ing for 1,500 for which he was willing
to pay 15 cents cash per rabbit. This
dealer of wild animals has, made a
reputation all over the United States.
He buys all kinds of animals and fills
orders, not only in Kentucky; but
from Maine to California. He is' not
only a very good business man, fbut 'he
stands high with the white population,
and also with his own race. He is as
prompt to JMfet his obligations at this!
office as any man on our books.
John D. Sharp, of Amanda vllle, is
excusable. The cold, disagreeable
weather kept him away from Colum
bia at the opening of circuit court,
the first time he has missed for many
years. He sent a representative in
the person of W. E. Morgan, who Is
also a regular.
A letter from Mr. S. L. Coffey, dated
Groveland, Ga., Jan: 19th, states that
he has a good school and is well pleased
with the climate and the hospitality
of the people. He will teach in the
3eth until summer.

SUGGESTIONS.

KNOX HALL.
Supporiyour home merchants. This
something that every man ought to
be proud $do. Your home merchants
are n)en -who are always with you.
They, are men of tried integrity. They
are men who have a livelihood to earn
ahd reputation to uphold. They are
not irr business today and out tomor
row. ! They do business at the same
old st&nd, day after day and year after
year. You buy an article of your
homeJmefchant and if it is not exact
ly as He represents it to you, you can
always find him, and he is more than
'willing to make his word good. Be
sides, he is a man, who, no doubt, has
leu you have goods time and again on
your promise to pay after harvest or
when the spring opened and you could
get work. This is something you
should think of when ordering goods
of a foreign firm. "Will they "carry"
you till after harvest? No indeed, if
you want their goods you must pay for
them when you get them, and run the
chances of the coffee being half peas
and the sugar half sand. It never
pays to patronize any smooth speak
ing stranger who tells you that the
men whom you have known and done
business with for years are swindling
you. He, himself, is not around on
a mission of mercy that he may take
a place among the throng that will
walk the streets of the New Jerusa
lem. In many towns of this size women's
clubs are numerous, and while they
are criticised by some, they are cer
tainly beneficial in many ways. In
small towns and villages the club has
been a special providence to many a
weary mother or to the woman of few
early advantages and large aspirations.
In our great cities women's clubs have
been the first to institute social re
forms and to call public attention to
crying evils.
You want good advice? Rise early.
Be abstemious. Be frugal. Attend
to your own business, and never trust
it to another. Be not afraid to work,
and diligently, too, with your own
hands. Treat everyone with civility
and respect. Good manners, insure
success.- Accomplish what you under
take. Neveribe mean rather give
than take the odd shilling. - Honesty
is not only the best poiicyt - but the
only-policy. Time is 'money. Make
your own word as good as. your bond.

When the tongue of trade is coated,
when the eyes and limbs of the clerk
are dull and languid, when the raging
fever tackles the empty vitals of the
till, when the spider roosts in the
empty cash box, and bouquets of de
cay are on the chandelier, it is con
clusive that the advertising doctor
has not been consulted.
All honor to the man who earns his
living by honest toil. He, it is, above
all others, who is always pulling for
better things. He is always on the
front seat of the community band
wagon. He is the first resident to
greet the stranger and tell him that
he is visiting the best town in the
state.
When a town ceases to wow it
commences to die, and the more the
people $ry to kill off each other in
their business and good name, the
more rapidly, will utter ruin come to
all. Stand .together for the advance
ment of every citizen. If a man
shows ability to prosper do not pull
him back with jealousy or weigh him
down with cold indifference.
Many a woman goes out shopping
dressed in silk and enveloped in per
fume whose hard-working husband
hasn't had a new suit of clothes or a
decent meal in five years. Yes, and
many a loafer stands on the street
with a stinking pipe in his face, his
tankfull of booze and his mouth full
of profanity, whose hard-working wife
hasn't had a new dress or a kind word
since she was married.
Every citizen in a town should be
interested in its prosperity. One of
the best ways to help a town is to
speak well of it. tt is true patriotism
to stand by your own town, and interf
ests that effect the town should effect,
every citizen.
A perfect town is that in which you
see the farmer patronizing the home
merchants, the laborers spending the
money they earn with: their own
tradesmen, and all animated .by a spir
it that will not purchase articles
abroad if they can be bought at home.
We are pleased to see many of our
citizens taking active interest in im
proving their homes and "grounds. A
little effort on the part of each citizen
would give our town a prominent posi
tion upon the map. Nature, has done
much for us in picturesque scenery,
now let us do much for ourselves along
the improvement line,

There are several negro men in jail
land have been for months. Awhile
before Christmas one or two broke
out with a disease which was pro
nounced small-pox. It was no't in an
aggravated form, but the health of
ficer, Dr. S. P. Miller, took the pre
caution to have the inmates of the
jail, including the jailer and his fam
ily quarantined, hence there is no
danger of the disease spreading. Dr.
Russell, who is not a health officer,
but has seen the patients, reports to
The News also that it is small-pox, in
a light form. The disease is not in
terfering with the affairs of Co
lumbia, every body moving along in
the even tenor of their way.

Whistling.
We read in the Courier-Journal of
recent date that at the conclusion of
an address by Speaker Clark, in the
House of Representatives, Washing
ton, D. C, the wife of Congressman
Kincheloe was repeatedly encored
while whistling several times. What
an age of advancement in the arts and
sciences. Would one of her countryfied
female fellowfolk be encored for
practicing such frivolities right out in
meeting. This, coupled with our craze
for national preparedness, carries me x
back to the days of Auld Lang Syne
and between the two there hangs a
tale. "Aunt" Sytha Lester, whose par
ents being dead, made her home at
my father's. She was of a remarkable
romantic turn of mind, and as she was
my senior by a few years, she would
frequently relate imaginary stories of
Indians, wild animals and generally a
boy with gun and dogs that bagged
the bear, killed a great many Indians,
ana maKing many nair-breadth es
capes.
It sseemed to require but little ef
fort on her part and would occasional
ly be continued indefinitely. Some of
them would have aDDeared well in
print, while they were intensely in
teresting to me and would usually be
tola in consideration of work on flower
beds or other items of light labor
which most always preceded the nar- -
rate. Once she was due me an ac
count of how a man taught a whist- "
ling school and after giving a general
outline of the proceedings at a school
of this kind, and in order to better
demonstrate the matter would assume,
quite a commanding attitude, facing
the scholars and call out "atention,
all!" "Pre-pare-to-pucker," which ..
always convulsed the scholars and pre
vented the pucker. She explained to
me, however, that next day he com
manded each pupil to chew an unripe
persimmon after which their lips
couldn't unpucker without being
greased. Although I took several
lessons, and as Dr. Benjamin-Frank-
ling said of himself, (I paid dear for
my whistling.) I have' never become
a good whistler, though this was
many years ago. We have not ob
served much improvement in the act, .v
for many whistle just like grandma , -.- :
