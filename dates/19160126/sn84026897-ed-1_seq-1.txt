One of the most elaborate and
enjoyable affairs held here this sea
son was the banquet of last Friday
night given by the Knights of Py
thias to their friends, there being
S about 3U0 present. The hall where
the banquet was held presented a
very festive air and Bearden's or
chestra from Augusta, discoursed
sweet music as the guests arrived
and gave attractive musical pro
gram. The banquet table was in the
shape of the Greek cross and the
colors of the lodge were attractive
ly carried out. Red carnations were
used in the decorations and their
bright touch of color and spicy
fragrance added greatly. A red car
nation was also laid at each cover.
Oysters, crackers, pickle, coffee and
a variety of fruits were abundantly
served and the Knights as a whole
were a most hospitable and atten
tive host. Following the feast,
speeches and toasts were the order
of the hour, Mr. Joseph W. Cox
acting as toast master. The chief
feature was the address of Mr.
Henry C. Tillman of Greenwood,
who was followed by Mr. J. Rut
ledge McGee. Prof. W. F. Scott's
toast was given in a bright and
happy manner, and a toast from Mr.
Cox concluded this enjoyable occa

A Beautiful Weddin* at ti
Home of Mr. and Mrs. H.
A. Smith.
, One of the prettiest home we
dings witnessed in Edgefield in
long time took place Wednesda
evening at 5:30 o'clock at the hon
of Mr. and Mrs Herbert Alexandr
Smith, when their eldest daughte
Allene Dozier Smith, became tb
wife of John Rainsford. They wei
married by the ceremony of tb
Catholic church, Father Ford c
Aiken officiating.
The entire lower floor of th
home was thrown ensuite and taste
fully decorated. The decorations i
the east and 1 west parlors and ha!
were white and green and those o
the dining room, where the brida
party gathered around the festa
board after the ceremony, were pi ni
and white. As the guests arriv?e
they were received at the door b;
Mis? Sallie Dunovant and Miss Ma<
Tompkins. The monotony and sus
pense of the interval between th?
arrival of the guests and the actua
time for the plighting of troths wai
relieved on this occasion by severa
musical numbers rendered on th?
piano by Mrs. John R. Tompkins
the first being Schubert's Serenade,
This was followed by UA Perf.-ci
Day."
Upon the announcement that the
bridal party awaited in the upper
hall, .Mrs. Tompkins sounded the
strains of Mendelssohn's wedding
march. The officiating priest was the
first to enter the west parlor, the
attendants entering as follows: Miss
Ruth Tompkins with Dr. Hugh C.
Mitchell, Miss Emily Adams with
H. M. Reyuold8, Miss Elizabeth
Rainsford with W. VV. Adams,
Miss June Rainsford with Stewart
Smith, Miss Emily Tompkins with
J. T. Mi ms. Jr., Miss Marjorie
Tompkins with Benjamin Greneker.
Next entered the maid of honor,
Miss Elizabeth Smith, ,% sister o?
;he bride. The groom entered with
lis best man, Benjamin Rainsford,
lis brother, of Greenwood, and the
jride was accompanied by her fa
ther.
The bride was clad in a. rich
fown of white satin with pearl
?rimmings, the conventional veil
idding to the grace of ber slender
rorm. ijpon her arm rested a bou
quet of bride's roses and valley
lilies. The maid of honor was at
ired. in pink messaline with p?arl
rimmings, her bouquet being pink
.oses. Three of the bridesmaids were
ittired in pink crepe de chine trim
ned with chiffon and three in blue
>f the same material, each carrying
i muff of chiffon, instead of the
sonventional bouquet. Little Emily
Tompkins, the flower girl, was
Iressed in white and was a veritable
ittle fairy.
After Mr. and Mrs. Rainsford
yere showered with congratulations
ind good wishts a social hour was
spent informally and very delight
fully, many seizing this opportunity
,o record their names in a book
yhich was presided over by Miss
Marion blalocK. The large assort
ment of numerous tokens in gold,
silver, china, cut glass, linen, paint*
ngs, etc., displayed in the west
parlor were admired during the so
cial hour.
Refreshments consisting of deli
cious salads, followed by ice cream
iud cake were served.
Mrs. Raiusford quietly withdrew
ind donned a stylish traveling suit
to be in readiness for the departure
upon their wedding journey. An
effort was made by Mr. and Mrs.
Rainsford to steal away undetected
but friends were on (the alert and
thwarted their plans, causing- them
to be pelted with rice and old shoes.
The sincere good wishes of hun
dreds of friends go with these popu
lar Edgefield young people.
A pretty young woman tripped
up to the counter where a new clerk
was storing music and, in her sweet
est tones, asked: "Have you kissed
cae in the moonlight?"
The clerk turned around, looked
at her, and answered: "lt must have
been the man at the other counter.
I've only been here a week."-San
Francisco Druggist.
Three-year-old Elsie came from
the back door of a neighbor's home,
eating a cooky.
"Elsie, her mother reproved, you
must not ask Mrs. Bowman for
cookies."
"I didn't ask her, rauzzer, return
ed Elsie undisturbed; I know where
she keeps 'em."

After carefully reading over the
program of national missionary oam
paign laymen's missionary conven
tion which meets in {Columbia soon,
we could see wisdom in our people
availing themselves of this great op
portunity that is being brought to
our state. Could the people catch
the spirit and realize what this ad
vantage means to them individually
surely the attendance would be to
overflowing.
Our county it is {[believed is pass
ing now, through a crisis, the re
sult can better be imagined and pre
pared for by broadening our hori
zon of intellect. Those anti-foreign
missionaries who would learn the
progress missions bas made in re
cent years. "How best to finance
the kingdom," "Missions as a per
sonal interest," "What we have and
what we are." These above subjeots
will be ably and eloquently handled
by some of our smartest Divines,
therefore, it is a great opportcnitv
before our people. May many use it
to the good of our coan try and to
God's glory.
An incident whibh occurred more
than fifty years ago near ?dgefield
village. A very prominent and
wealthy gentleman accompanied by
his wife were gbiug to town. They
overtook in a deep cut in the road a
man sickened and. crazed by whis
key, so disgusting and tiresome was
bis conduct, the gentleman who was
A hard drinker himself, said to his i
wife, a sweet gentle lady, Katie tell
me, "do I look like that when Pm
3runk?" ,lYes, Seth," she sud.
'Tbat'8 just the way you look."
"'I'lUnever touch another drop as <
ong as" I live" he replied. They liv- |
id many years together afterward.
The resolution was unbroken, re- j
'using on bis death bed to take j
whiskey preecribed by his physi
;ian saying, "I'd rather die." As in ?
hat case how well for us "to see <
mrselves" as others see us. Daily
nfiuence is leaving your mark on ?
he world. Hear Lieutenant-Colonel \
?alford of New York in Columbia
m the above subject. Shouldn't we
is Christians be praying for that
neeting. .
Misses Wates, and Evans cur '
;eachevs at Flat Rock, report a (
jplendid time at the teachers' as- i
sociation on last Saturday. Those
neetiugs to be a success must meet
inrith co-operation of each teacher,
rheir presence even stimulates and
incourages efficiency. Patrons
mould encourage and assist their \
teachers in attending each session.
At the monthly meeting yester
day of Y. W. A's. they reluctantly
?ave up four enrolled members,
jame members came to them from
sunbeams. Misses Lou Eva Park
man, Ruby Dorn, Maggie Agner,
Nettie Bush.
Our young folks are joyous over
anticipation of box party at Flat
Rock on the 28th. Our efficient and
beloved teachers are so unselfish.
They are interested and love their
work.
Sawmills, sawmills on every side
of us. Our town is building up so
rapidly. The wood is being destroy
ed in order to build. Fire wood will
soon be to each of us what it al
ready is to many, hard and incon
venient to obtain.
Listen for the wedding bells down
here real soon, the sound keeps
ringing nearer by us. We are loath
to give up our girls and boys, too,
so young.

so we did until about one o'clock.
Then we were invited in to a sumpt
uous dinner, a regular wedding din

birthday delayed a few days. My,
it was a grand dinner, one we will
all remember to the end of time.
Just after fr. o'clock the quilt was
finished, ar-si taken out the frames,
and then Itfjs: H. F. Cooper stitch

Lee and Jackson Day Appro
priately Observed by Edge
field School.
The celebration of Lee and Jack
son day took place in the high
school auditorium Wednesday,
January. 19, ateleven thirty o'clock.
The stage was artistically deoorated
with flags the pictures of both gen
erals being crowned with wreathes.
Rev. Mr. Bailey opened the exer
cises with a prayer after wb'ch the
students sang "Dixie." Edwin Folk
rendered splendidly a declamation
entitled, . "Stonewall Jackson's
way." "Let us pass over the river
and rest under the shade of the
trees" was sweetly sung by the Con
federate choir, and Onida Pattison
recited "The sv:ord. of Lee.,K The
choir in company with the sch
?ang"Maryland,"and'then Dr."
Jones delivered a' most eicelh.
dress on "Lee and Jackson,
reotly after Dr. Jones' addresi
Gov J. C. Sheppard pre
crosses of honor to two veterans
This enjoyable and instructive pro
gram was ck sed by singing "Ho w
firm a foundation."
Miss Belle Williams visited the
graded and high schools Friday
norning, January 21. She made
I very interesting talk in chapel on
birds and ended her talk by begging
the boys to be considerate and use
their sling shots more sparingly.
She visited each class room telling
the children how they should treat
;he birds and also trying to form
dubs for the purpose of protecting
:hem. We feel sure that, Miss Wil
lama' talk made a great impression
m the students and will make them
vant to protect rather than destroy
)ur southern songsters.
The teachers meeting on Satur
lay, January 23, was a most enjoy
ible event. Almost e^ny ie&frber
Sdge?eld county w^-f^fese'jA^'
b?* program rendered wasthorough
y interesting. The dinner prepared
>y the ladies of the W. 0. T. U.
vas excellent, and many, many
hanks are due them for their kind
iess. The teachers decided to have
j'ield day the latter part of March.
The amusement for the day will
sonsist in base ball, basket ball and
hat night a declamation and recita
ion contest between the boys and
rirla of the different schools will
ake place. This promises to be a
rery enjoyable day and we desire
he co-operation of the town people
oward making it more successful.
School Correspondent.
Mrs. Greneker Appointed.
Mrs. Hallie N. Greneker has
>een appointed organizer for Edge
ield county for the School Im
provement association- Every school
n the county, it matters not how
miall, should have such organiza
lion. In addition to improving the
jchool building, equipment and
jrounds, it affords an opportunity
jr means for the patrons to co
operate with the teacher in what
3ver is undertaken for the benefit
of the school. Not only one or two
individuals in the community should
stand by the teacher, but the en
tire community should have a part
in making the neighbprhood school
what it should be. An or
ganization provides a channel or
means through which all can have a
part. Communicate with Mrs. Gren
eker about the formation of such
an organization for your school and
she will gladly give you all of the
assistance possible.

CONFEDERATE SOLDIERS.
Mr; Wright's Article in The Ad
vertiser Commended Would
Pension All Veterans
and Widows, "
Editor The Advertiser: Please
give me space in your paper this
week \o thank Mr. J. Russell
Wright for what he has written in
the interest of the Confederate sol
diers, the men who staked their
lives and their all for the Confeder
ate caus?. Yes, .they staked their ali
and after four years of great hard
ship incident to the war they lost,
but they did not despair. They
came home and picked np the hoc
and the plow arid went to work with
the same indomitable will that car
ried them to the front of battle.
& Mr. Wright has pointed oat
[many of the facts, but the half baa
hot been told. Some fellows said we
could whip the Yankees with sticks
and rocks and still others said we
can whip them . with corn-stalks,
and do it in 60 dajs. I noticed these
corn-stalk fellows were conspicu
ous bv their absence when the bat
tle line was formed.
I arji of the opinion that our leg
islative halls have too many sons of
these corn-stalk men. I know some
af them are true "bl ne, for I fought
ind bled beside their fathers, and
[ believe that thpy will do all in
their powei- to help the old soldiers.
My platform is that every oi<?
moldier should be placed on the bon
>r roll and that receivine a pension
should be an honor, instead of hav
Lg the pension roll, as it now ap
pears, a pauper, list. I have never
tpplied for a pension but ? have
>een told that in order to get one
m old soldier must admit that he is -
. pauper. T J>e!ieve every old sol
lo.'-, r-'ch'?.a'afjBi^^^j^*l',-^i'iii a
tension, and that it is an honor to
lave his name-vm the pension roll,
rhe legislature Should enact a law
naking it an honor. .
The next and most vital point is
hat veterans should be given enough
or a decent living; not less than.
$96 a year, and really should be
HO per month. When an old man
valks up to have his name placed
>n this honor roll all that should be
isked him is what company he be
onged to and have him furnish
aroof of the day of enlistment and
iischarge. All should have the
jame ratine-, the rich and the poor
ilike. If auyone should not need
.he pension he could give it to *oine
>ne who does or to some charitable
;ause.
I have been asked by a great
nany people why I do uni apply
for a pension. One reason is I can
ive without it and the other is I
nave too much pride and manhood
LO place my hame on the pauper
list, as I see it. There are not many
af the old soldiers left to get a pen
sion and the state should take care
o? what few are left in a creditable
manner and not send them to the
ilras house like the one iu Colum
bia.
One other matter: When a man
dies and leaves an aged widow the
same pension should be given her
while she lives, for she too will soon
follow. Let her be made comforta
ble for she too did her part in the
war.
