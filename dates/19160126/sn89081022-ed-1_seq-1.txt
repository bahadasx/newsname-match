The queMum of a public hospital'

After hearing the various ideas, sutr-'.
pestions and opinions of those who
spoke, the following conclusion was
drawn—the tune is ripe for a gener
al hospital for tins eitv the conimun
iLy needs an institution such as tins.
where any physician may take a ease
t'or treatment. It was srenerallv agreed
however, that this city cannot sup
port two hospitals. The idea of mak
ing the new hospital, if one is con
structed, a count\ institut on. one MI
which people all over the countv are
interested, met with the approval ut
all.
It was pointed out. that at the pres
ent time, there is no other general
hospital running in this county. Rev.
Johanson of Spicer stated that he had
travelled a great deal and had seen
the necessitv of an institution, such
as this, and had seen the good done
by them. The people of this city
should look upon it as a business
proposition, one that would be the
means of bringing people to tins citv
He favored making it a county hos
pital.
Dr. Christian Johnson told of his at
tempts at starting such an institution
twenty years ago, but that the time
was not then ripe. He favored hav
ing one hospital, managed so that it
would never fall into the hands of anv
clique of physicans. The building to
be built from private donations, with
aid from the city and countv. It
should not be a commercial, but a
hospital enterprise. He favored hav
ing ladies as the incorporators, citing
the case of the Northwestern Hospital
of Minneapolis, as an example of the
broad spirit of service and freedom.
where all creeds and all people are
accommodated. His idea is to have
no doctors connected in any wav with
the management of the hospital.
Doctor Johnson's speech had the
same effect as the keynote speech at
a political meeting, and those who
followed the doctor seemed to favor

Name and Scope is Enlarged.
The scope of the San Diego Expo
sit'on has been increased so greatly
for litlt that the directors have found
it necessary to change the name to
read. "Panama-California Internation
al Kxposition." Canada. Russia,
France. Italy, Germany, Austria, Bra
zil. The Netherlands, and Switzerland
are installing big displays.—the great
er part of them brought from the
San Francisco Exposition. Other feat
ures of the beautiful Exposition have
been enlarged so tliat the re-dedica
tion of the new Exposition, March 15,
is more than a matter of form.

"Mars" arrived in San Diego the mid
dle of January carrying 150 tons of
the government exhibit which will be
displayed at the Panama-California In
ternational Exposition through the en
tire year 1916. The government will
participate in the 1916 Exposition to

DR. J. S. GIBSON.
Dr. J. S. Gibson, a Territorial pio
neer, who was the first resident phy
sician within the limits of Kandiyohi
county, passed away at Wayzata last
Sunday. The funeral was held at At
water yesterday afternoon. Services
were conducted at 1:30 o'clock from
the Presbyterian church, of which. Dr.
Gibson was an active member during
his long residence at Atwater.
Dr. James S. Gibson was born at
Ayr, Ontario. Nov. 9, 1842, and was
of Scotch-Irish parentage. When he
was ten years of age the family mov
ed to West Union, Iowa, where they
remained a year. Then they came to
Dodge county, near Mantorville in this
state, where they continued to reside
until 1S66. The deceased attended the
rural school, later Northwestern col
lege at Wasioja and at the Owatonna
High School.
The Late Dr. J. S. Gibson.
In July of 1866, at Owatonna, the
deceased was married to Miss Evaline
Libby, daughter of Thomas Libby, a
Methodist minister. The young cou
ple went to Chicago, where Mr. Gib
son entered the Chicago Medical col
lege. He graduated in March of 1869.
In the summer of 1869, he located
for practice at Green Lake, and in
1870 at New London. In 1873 he lo
cated permanently at Atwater where
he continued to practice until com
pelled by advancing age to retire.
Dr. Gibson was a strong character
whose influence thruout a long and
useful life was always given to assist
those in distress and to civic progress.
Dr. Gibson leaves, a son, Atty. Gib
son1, and two daughters.
Albert H. Sperry of Willmar at
tended the funeral of the late Dr. Gib
son. Tn an interview with the Trib
une editor, Mr. Sperry paid Dr. Gib
son a fine tribute. No matter how
bad the weather or how tired he was,
whether there was any pay in sig.it
or not, Dr. Gibson responded to every
call. He was a man of rugged phy
sique, and he never spared himself
4n
his service of the community. In the
early pioneer days with the practice
scattered over large territory and no
roads, this meant more than in the
present day.

ROADSIDE SCHOOL
ISJ1EDICATED
The dedication of the new school
house in District No. 45 near the St.
Johns church, last Thursday evening
was an occasion of great inter
est. All who attended are enthus
iastic about the spirit of true prog
ress that pervaded the meeting. The
larger part of those attending were
unable to get into the main room, but
filled the entrances, cloak rooms', li
brary and basement. Four bob-sleigh
loads of pupils, teachers, et al., of the
Willmar schools were in attendance.
Supt. G. A. Foster, of the Willmar
Associated Schools, presided in his
usual happy manner.
The first number was composed of
songs by the pupils of the Lafayette
school of Willmar, who did themselves

credit in their appearance. Twice
they were up, and finally recited in
unison their civic creed. We give it
in this connection because we think
it is well worth printing:
"I'm a pupil of the Lafayette
School, a citizen of Willmar,
of Minnesota, and of the Unit
ed States.
"It is my right and my duty
to make an honest living and
to be comfortable and happy.
"It is my privilege, and my
duty to help others to secure
these benefits.
"I will work hard and' play
fair.
"I will be kind to all especial
ly to little children, to old
people, to the unfortunate,
and to animals.
"I will help to make Willmar
a clean, beautiful and law
abiding city. These are the
best services I can render to
my school, my city, my state
and my country."
The children were highly compli
mented and publicly thanked in the
meeting by Director C. J. Hanson, for
coming out.
The first speaker was Nels Nelson,
the old pioneer, the sole remaining
resident in the community of that
early band of settlers who located on
the St. Johns prairie over a year be
fore there was any Willmar or rail
road to this county. Mr. Nelson re
viewed the struggle of early days in
a very interesting manner. August
O. Forsberg was called on as one of
the teachers in the early period, and
he responded in his usual witty and
effective style. He depicted the dif
ficulties of teachers and pupils in the
pioneer period in district No. 45 as
well as elsewhere. C. J. Hanson spoke
for the local board, in a very neat
little speech. He spoke of the assist
ance received from County Supt. of
School Frederickson, who was unable
to be present at the dedication. An
ton Peterson, the builder, told of his
experience and vouched for the qua!
ity of material and work that went
into the building. The State Depart
ment of Education was represented by
Miss1 Mabel Carney, and she proved
in every way a worthy representative.
She was unassuming in appearance,
but she made an inspiring address
and quite won the hearts of her large
audience. Rev. M. B. Michaelson,
spoke as the local pastor, on the mor
al side of community life. He be
lieved in the common, schools as the
great force that will melt the various
elements of our population into a
strong nation. The church must teach
religion and the common schools sec
ular knowledge if church and state
are to remain separate. V. E. Law
son was called on as "the county his
torian" and as representing the Board
of Education. Musical numbers were
interspersed. Thorwald Hanson gave
two violin selections and the pupils
of Dist. 45 sang two songs very ac
ceptably. At the close the ladies ser
ved lunch to all who attended.

The decision to build was reached
Aug. 1, 1914.
The contract was let to Anton O.
Peterson, April 3, 1915. The furnace
was installed by the Willmar Hard
ware Co. The ventilation was good.
Friday's meeting was a supreme test
of the latter and it stood the test well.
The total cost of the schoolhouse with
furnace and ventilation was $3,273.
The present school board consists of
John L. Hamann, chairman H. H.
Hanson, treasurer and C. J. Hanson,
clerk. They acted as building com
mitter with the addition of E. G.
Fricke and Martin Nelson.
The school grounds consists of two
acres, and plans are now being made
to improve the grounds to harmonize
with the new building. The present
teacher is Miss Alma Grimlund, a
young lady of Willmar.
Dist. No. 45 was established by the
county board of Kandiyohi county,
June 7, 1869 as Dist. No. 9. When
the county consolidation took place,
it was renumbered to No. 45. It has
been named the Roadside School, by
a vote of the pupils.
