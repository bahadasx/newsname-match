Immediately after; Attorney General
Rice announced that the state had
rested, Arthur Cushing, r counsel for
Mrs. - Mohr, moved- that , the indictment
against his. client" be dismissed on the
ground that; it was at variance with
the : evidence. ; . The motion was dis
missed by the court. '
. A similar motion ' in behalf of Spell
man also was denied. ;1
By the testimony of more than BO
witnesses; : including' , George Healis,
Dr.' Mohr's . -chauffeur, who turned
state's"" evidence, the prosecution ; had
attempted -to prove that the negroes
shot the physician a the instigation
of Mrs. Mohr.
Counsel stated that Mrs. Mohr would
go- on the stand- in her own defense.
Capain George " H.! Monahan, of . the
Providence police, testified that1 he ar

the prisoner he. did not , have ta. talk
but that if he talked to tell the truth.
Brown told Chief lO'T& ill, the witness

Long Hill Line Officers Tak
en on Body Writs in $450,
000 Suit Brought By Dan
bury & Bethel Trolley Co.
' Stockholders.
As a result of alleged gross mis
management, three directors of the
Bridgeport . Danbury Electric R. R.
Co. were arrested yesterday on body
writs to satisfy a $450,000 suit brought
by John E. Henshaw of - New York,
trustee on the estate of George E.
Pond. Deputy Sheriff Cunningham
after a long search - about the state
arrested in Norwalk President John.
Sanders of the trolley company, Secre
tary and Treasurer S. Wi C. Jones and
j E. W. Sperry, , .- one of the directors.
1 After being detained a short time all
three were released under bonds of
JIO.OOO each furnished by former
Judge James F. Walsh of the criminal
common pleas court. Benjamin T.
Saunders, of Danbury, is also named
as a defendant but he has not, yet
been located.' , i", - - i- .
The Pond estate holds a large block
of . stock in the Danbury .& Bethel
Street Railway Co. This company has
been consolidated with the Bridgeport
& Danbury Co., which operates cars
as far as Long Hill. HBnshaw's con
tention is that the directors have so
mismanaged the affairs of the twp
roads that the value of the Pond hold
ings has been greatly- decreased.
He asks the superior court to order
the directors to' render an accounting
of theiy actions to the Danbury &
Bethel stockholders, to - pay to the
company treasury the losses sustained
by their misjnanagement and pay th
plaintiff's counsel , fees. He . also - asks
that the-directors- be. enjoined from
selling bonds of the Danbury A Bethel
Co. . - .-.'.' -:- - ; ' . .'. j
It is said that about seven years ago
the . defendants go. control - of the
Danbury: & Bethel road by securing
6,729 out of 12,800 shares.. Up to 1912
this road paid annual dividends of 4
per'eent. and in that year there was a
surplus of $8,314.79. For the fiscal
year ending June 30, 1915, there was a
deficit of $13' 500.54.
When the defendants bought the
charter , of the Bridgeport & Danbury
Co. from John T. King it is claimed
that they voted to issue $300,009
worth of. -bdhds. .The D.anbury -&
Bethel Co. was made liable for the
debts of the Bridgeport & Danbury
Co., . a franchise which. , was worth
only $60,000, although bonds five
times in excess of that amount were
issued. . Henshaw declares that the
revenue'from the Bridgeport & Dan
bury line for the past year -was only
$3,950, while the interest due amount
ed, to $17,750.-
As the two roads had been con
solidated. Henshaw claims that the
transaction he complains , of resulted
in financial loss to him and other
Danbury . & Bethel stockholders. He
declares tiat the directory 'acted with
impropriety and with fraudulent in
tent when they voted for the large
bond issue. ' -
Because of the alleged , irregular
dealings of . the directors Henshaw
says the liabilities of the Danbury &
Bethel Co. have -increased from $469,
909.37 in 1912 to $902,972.21 in 1915.
Despite, the fact that the earnings of
the road increased during that period
there was a large deficit and the
company has been unable to pay divi
dends. ; .
The suit, which is returnable to the
February term . of the civil superior
court, yvas instituted by Attorneys De
Forest & Klein of this city. ,

points out, the board of assessors has failed to do its duty of

City Auditor Bernard Keating, dean of the Connecticut's munici
pal financiers has striven to keep the. tax rate down. But the
best he can do, after eliminating many of the further extrava
gances planned by the administration, is tb recommend the levy
of a tax rate that ranks among ihe highest in the large cities of
America. ' . - . .p.
. Here are some of the things which he has eliminated, in his
recommendations to the tax board:
- The. one mill tax for schools.
The two platoon system for the fire department. ' '
The addition of 61-piylicemen. -
Funds sought for ".macadam repairs." " v '

cept by an estimate, wnat tne
The proposed tax rate, if laid on tho
same list as that of last year, would
reach 25 mills. . ' "
The report of the auditor is in part
as follows:.
We are cbnfronted again with the
problem of providing for the wants
of a growing municipality for another
fiscal vear. Increased industrial ac-
tivities have so increased the demands
upon us that we are obliged to resort
to J-Unusual means in 'order --to ade
quately provide for the city's needs.
. The problem which confronts a city,
but once in itsexlstence has come to
Bridgeport and it now rests with us for
our own sake to meet it ,and solve
it effectually, lest upon our failing to
do so the industrial boom may desert
us and seek more auspicious or con
genial soil in which to grow.
- Our city's entire future depends to a
great extent on how we mee the
present issue. We have it in out
power, either' to make or to mar the
city's future development.
In order to solve the problem, we
must spend money but we ought to
spend It wisely, bo that full value and
adequate results .may be obtained" for
the outlay. . ,
We do not want to be too optimistic,
not too conservative but steer the hap
dv middle- course. Provide fully for
all reasonable requirements, but not be
too sanguine that teh industrial boom,
in its present proportions is going to
stay with us after the conditions which
were the immediate causes'of its crea
tion have ceased to exist. We cannot
and ought not to be expected to pro
vide for the unusual demands upon us
by the ordinary revenues from taxa
tion, but are justified in resorting to
bonding for all improvements of a
permanent nature. But we ought not
to bond for anything else, and the 1'fe
of tlie bonds in every instance ought
to be less than the life of the improve
ment bonded for.
Things We Ought Not to Bond For
I have, never favored and do not now
favor bonding for the ordinary nor
mal needs of the city in the matter of
grade schools. I look upon such im
provements as current needs and ex
penses as long as our city continues t
grow, and we ought to provide for
such normal growth from year to year
from tho proceeds of taxation. But in
the case of abnormal growth like the
present, I consider that we are fully
justified in bonding for grade schools
to the extent at least of such excess
requirements above" the normal ones.
Ofxcourse, there can be no question
that the cost of new High schools.
Technical schools, or Trade schools,
which, are. required perhaps, but once
in a generation ought to be spread j
over the entire period of the Ufa of
only, but mat proportion oi taxpayers is so. smaii as to ne now;
almost inconsiderable. , y . , , j
The auditor refers sharply to the delinquency, of the board !
of assessors, in failing to have their work completed before Jan, I
1, as the, law requires. Today, at a time when it was necessary
to make his report, the auditor, had no means of knowing, ex-
list of 1915, payable this year, is
p j- n t .
grana usi win ne
such improvements, as it would be tin- i
just to compel the taxpayer in any 1
one year to meet their cpst. The school
authorities state in, their requisition, to
me that they do not ask for, any ap
propriation for the construction of
new grade schools from the proceeds
of taxation, but expect that all re
quirements will be provided from the
proceeds of a bond issue.
I rnereiore, in accoruauuu witu ixim
express wish, I do not make any rec
ommendation'for an appropriation for
new grammar schools.
y The Debt of City. ,
! It will do no harm to bear n mind
that while the city is not up to the
legal limit", still it is fairly large and
requires quite a share of our revenues
to care for it. During the next fiscal
year, the existing debt will require
$418,903 to meet its obligations. This
includes payment to sinking fund, in
stallations on-.serial bonds and notes
and interest. ' This sum does not pro
vide for' any . contemplated additions
to our bonded debt, as I am unable at
the present- time to figure with ac
curacy the amount, of such additions;
As soon as the volume of same can be

money must be provlded to meet such!
new obligations In addition ,to tne
foregoing . sum.- . feo, that it' can be
readily seen that the city debt is not
an unmixed blessing. If it could, be
avoided, we -would be much better off
without it. It is well to bear in mind,
however, that under our excellent
system of serial bond and, note issues,
we are paying off. each ear, a f air
portion of the debt and arethus light
ening future burdens to that extent
at least. The following are the items
called for in , caring for our city debt:
