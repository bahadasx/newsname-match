GREAT BENEFIT
TO COMMUNITY
The Joy Meetings of Last Week Very
Largely Attended and Will Bear
Fruit in Lives of Youth
CLOSING ADDRESS SPLENDID ONE
Dr. Joy Mad* Lasting Friends of Den
iaon Youths, Leaving Behind Many
Inspirations for Good.
The study ot our youth in the lec
tures of Dr. Joy grew more interest
ing from day to day thrpughout the
campaign of last week and large num
bers of interested parents and young
men and women gathered each suc
cessive evening to listen to the speak
was possessed of exceptional
ability in the presentation of ideas
and fasts concerning a subject of such
universal interest and importance.
The music, following Tuesday eve
ning, was most enjoyable, including
In the half hour of preliminary serv
ice a special number on each occasion.
Among those who kindly furnished
musical numbers were Miss Delia
Brandt, the College Quartet, Lenahan
Laliy, Harold Norman, Miss Edna
Wright and the Girls' Glee Club of the
high school. Dr. Joy himself is a mu
sician of ability- and favored the audi'
•v: ence with music on several occasions.
The lecture of Tuesday evening on
the subject, "The Boy Problem As We
Face It," embraced a discussion of
three characteristics which appear in
the bo£ during his adolescent years
which must be properly treated in or
der that they may be overcome and
not prove .detrimental to the attain
ment
0f
the best in life for him. The
subject was discussed under the top
ics, "The Rude Boy," "The Lazy Boy"
and "The Lonely Boy."
On Wednesday evening "The Unity
of the Educational Process" was the
subject of the lecture and proved to
be. as Dr. Joy stated previous to its
delivery, what he considered the most
unique of his entire repertoire.
"Training by the Art of Suggestion"
brought home to the minds of those
in whose care the training of children
lias been placed, perhaps more than
any of the other subjects, the tremen
dous responsibility which is involved
In the rearing of a boy. "Never call
your boy anything which you would
rot be willing to have him become,"
was the -conclusion of Dr. Joy, and,
following the illustrations given on
this point, the power of suggestion
•was inded forcibly impressed upon
his listeners.
The closing address of the week,
"Success—Te Quest of the Human,"

was beautiful in its thouhgt, including
as the three great requisites of suc
cess, first "The Right Relation to
God secondly, "The Right Relation
to One's Fellowmen," and thirdly
"Efficiency." The speaker in closing
told a most impressive story illus
trative of the fact that "We are meant
for the Heights."
The main avenues through which
the best in the child can be brought
out, according to the speaker, are con
tact with the child and confidence of
the child in the parent or teacher.
One felt the truth of the statements
of Dr. Joy because they were given as
the result of study of the boy, not on
ly from a psychological standpoint ob
tained through books, but especially
through his experience in meeting and
studying hundreds of thousands of
the youth of our coowiry.
The boys of our junior and senior
high schools learned to love Dr. Joy
during his short stay in their midst,
and he left on Saturday afternoon
leaving behind him inspiration, high
er id^alg of manhood and womanhood
and greater ambition in the minds of
our youth to be the best which it Is
possible to be.
The guarantee of the small sum of
tw0 hundred dollars, made by a num
ber of the business men of the city,
was easily made good and the people
in the audience each evening respond
ed generously, according to their abil
ity, in making up the necessary
amount. The benefit to the commun
ity, however, obtained through the
work of Dr. Joy is not to be estimated
by the amount of material remunera
tion extended him, but it will no
doubt bear fruit in the lives of boys
and Kirls of Denison far, far into the
future.
Mr. A. C. Balle received a letter the
first of the week from A cousin who
lives at Hamburg, Germany, in which
was enclosed a photograph of three
of his cousins who are fighting with
the German army somewhere in
France. All of the young men hold
commissions in the army and one of
tliem has won the iron cross for brav
ery. Mr. Balle's cousin writes that
Germany is not'at all worried over tlie
outcome of the war and that they feel
assured that eventually they will be
victorious, although the war may be
prolonged indefinitely on account of
the United States shipping munitions
to the allies. There is no truth to the
reports that Germany is short of food
supplies and business conditions in
the empire are about the same as be
fore the war. Mr. Balle was very
much pleased to receive the letter and
know that his relatives are enjoying
good health.
Mr. and Mrs. James McKim, of De
loit, spent yesterday in Denison, the
guests of Mr. and Mrs. John Cook.
WATER FROM NEW
WELL ANALYZED
Engineer Woolston Receives Analysis
of Water From New Deep Well,
Recently Sent to Iowa City
THE SUPPLY WILL BE TESTED
City May 8ave Money by Making a
'Test and Ascertaining if Greater
Oepth is Necessary.
City Engineer Frank Woolston re
ceived a report Monday from the lab
oratories of the State. University of
Iowa, showing the condition of the
water from the city's new deep well.
According to this report tho chemical
and bacteriological analysis show that
the water is contaminatq:) to a slight
degree, but it is believed that this con
tamination is undoubtedly due to the
drilling operation which was poing on
when the samples were taken from the
well. Henry Albert, director of the
state laboratorie-s at Iowa City, in
writing to Mr. Woolston. stated that
it is quite usual for new wells to show
contamination to some degree, and, he
goes on to say that they clear up as
a rule after the drilling and foreign
material introduced in drilling are
removed. He advises that analysis
should be made from time to time to
show the condition of the water.
The report has been sent in to J. G.
Thome, consulting engineer,, at Clin
ton, who drew the plans and specifi
cations for Denison's new deep well,
showing the depth of the well and
stating that at the time the report
was made the water was $1 feet from
the top while pumping. Mr. ^Thorne
believes that the well cannot lie prop
erly tested with a bailer and has in
structed the city engineer to require
Gray & Brothers, who, have the con
tract for drilling the well, to make a,
24 hour test, pumping at the rate of!
200 gallons per minute. It might be
possible that after, the water has been
drawn down to ,100 feet the supply
might come in faster and it might I
found that the water level was higher
than 100 feet at the end of the test.
This condition may not be found in
Denison, however, as it is believed
that the water bearing strata does not
contain any crevices in this part of
the state. It i's a well known fact
that any well which has been given a
good pumping out will yield more wa
ter than one which has not been
pumped out. and it may prove that
the well, which is now down in the
neighborhood of 1600 feet, has an am
ple supply for Denison's needs. While
there is considerable expense attached
to testing out the well for a jjeriod pf

24 hours, if it is found that the sup
ply of water is adequate Uie city will
save a large amount of money by riot
having the well sunk deeper. There
is danger of sinking the well to such
a depth that a mineral water would
be struck and in some cases this wa
ter is not desirable. It is the opinion
of Mr. Thorne that an adequate sup
ply of water will be found by the time
the welli has been sunk to a depth of
1800 feet.
"A PAIR OF SIXES."
Play Under Above Title Coming to
Denison Saturday Evening of
This Week—Said to be Good
Managor Krauth. of the Germania
cpera house, has booked another good
show for Saturday evening of this
week. The play to be presented is
"A Pair of Sixes," which was such
success at the Longacre theater in
New York, where it ran for over a
year. It is an out and out farce, well
written, original in its story and with
most ingeniously contrived- situations
thai, are screamingly funny. It has
besides, a pleasant love element to
help along the development of the
plot. But it is above all a farce in
tended purely to make men and wom
en forget their troubles and laugh in
unrestrained glee. The play comes
to Denison highly recommended. In
addition to the play. Manager Krauth
has requested the Review to announce
that the usual motion picture program
will be given before the show, com
mencing at 7:30. and that no addition
al charge will be made for the pic
tures.# The play will commence at 9
o'clock.

GERMANY OFFEN
SIVE IN BELGIUM
Break Long Period of Inactivity There
by a Violent Assault—Gain the
French Lines in Places.
MANY MINES ARE EXPLODED
The German Attack Over a Line 1500
Yards Long Signalled in This Way
—Occupy Newly Created Craters
After a long period of comparative
inactivity in Belgium, heavy fighting
has broken out with the initiative in
the hands of the Germans. The French
official report of today states that af
ter a heavy bombardment the Germans
lost an attack with infantry over a
front of 1500 yards near Nieuport. At
some places 11'.ey succeeded in occu

time, but, Paris reports, were expelled
subsequently from most of this terri
tory.
Paris, Jan. 2j—The French war of
fice statement on the progress of hos
tilities given out this afternoon says
that last night there was continued
artillery activity in the vicinity of
Nieuport in Belgium. The results of
this are described as favorable to the
French.
German troops at one point pene
trated the first line of French trenches,
but they were dt. once driven out after
a very spirited fight.'
In the Artois district yesterday eve
ning German forces attacked the
French lines over a distance of 1500
yards. The preparatory work consist
ed in the explosion of a number of
mines, followed by a very violent bom
bardment.
The Germans were driven back to
their lines by the French fire, accord
ing the official statement. They
were successful in occupying some
craters, 'however, but from most of
these they were later expelled.

of the enemy yesterday against our
positions east of Neuville St. Vaast,
which resulted in complete failure, was

bombardment, the Germans delivered

JUDGE ALBERT
ARRIVES ON TIME
District Court Convened Monday Af
ternoon and Assignment of Cases
Made—Grand Jury Impanelled.
LITTLE WORK FOR GRAND JURY
First Case Called Was That of Peter
Frahm vs Peter Eggeriv*-Case
on Docket for Two Years
-St
District court has been in session
since Monday afternoon. Judge Albert
with his reporter, arrived at 1 o'clock
and opened the January, term lis
scheduled for the 24th. The calendar
was immediately called and the cases
for trial assigned, the jury cases coin
ing on at the beginning of the term,
contrary to the usual cuatoip. This
change was evidently made in order
to prevent the first week of court be
ing wasted in part by the trial of
equity business.
After the assignments were made
the court impanelled the grand jury,
with Mr. Fishel, of Dow City, as fore
man. The work of the grand jury was
concluded by Tuesday, and at 3: o'clock
in the afternoon, upon making their
final report, the jury was discharged.
There was but one indictment return
ed, that beiqg against Logan Maxson
for stealing harness in the neighbor
hood of Schleswig. Logan Maxson
was recently tried on a similar charge
in Harrison county and convicted, and
was sentenced for a term of Ave years
in the state penitentiary.. This is cer
tainly a fine record for Crawford
county and shows how few infractions
of the criminal law occur here.
Tlie first case on the law calendair
for trial and which is now on trial, is
that of Peter Frahm vs Peter Eggers,
which grows out of'the sate of a stall
ion several years ago. The case has
been on the docket ,for two or three
years and it is to be hoped it will be
finally disposed of before this term
adjourns. Several cases have been
settled and continued and increases
the probability of the trial of cases
more recently brought than was un
derstood at the beginning of the term.
The next case to be tried following
the Frahm-Eggers case is that of Alj
stot vs Rpbinson. The two cases wiil
probably occupy the attention of the
court the remainder of the week.
The W. R. 'C:*s held a profitable and
enjoyable meeting with Mrs. T. E.
Pearson Tuesday evening. This class
in missions has just been promoted
and is henceforth to be under the ex-1
cellent leadership of Miss" Map Hayes.
