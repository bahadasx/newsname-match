the following dispatch from its Jeffer
son City correspondent:
Governor Major took drastic meth
ods yesterday to prevent a deficit in
the state treasury at the close of the
present year. His plan is to hold ev
ery state institution down to its act
ual needs for maintenance and the
payment of the oiil list. This, he
says, will obviate deficit in the reve
nue ruiid and permit the institutions
to go ahead with their woik. It will.
howeer. prevent the expending of
money for extensions, new buildings,
acquisition of lands and mam o'lior
items, not a part of the support of
civil list of the institutions.
The goornor sent a letter to all the
institutions notifying them of this ac
tion ami warning tlieiu that it will lie
useless to send any of the forbidden
accounts hen- for payment, as he has
instructed the state auditor not to
pay them.
The last Legislature ovorappropri
ated the revenue to the extent of $1,
TOO.uoo. After it adjourned the gov
ernor vetoed or held up over $2,133.
CCO. This still left about $2,t'.00.000
above the receipts, should all lie
drawn. The governor proposes that
this figure shall be trimmed down to
a safe point.
The governor points out that the
constitution gives priority to seven ap
propriations, to wit Interest on Un
bonded debt, sinking fund, public
schools, assessing and collecting the
revenue, the civil list, support of elee
mosynary institutions and payment of
the General Assembly. After these
have boon eared for, other objects of
legislative appiopriatious iua come in
and take what is left, if there is any
thing left, hut these are paramount
and precede other appropriations.
Two of these items enumerated in
the constitution no longer exist. For
all the other the governor says there
is ample revenue.

Mr. McQuitty was born near Wood-

yesterday afternoon. The difference
in the women's dresses offered near
ly as much contrast as did the stan
dardized dress and the costume of
the one mere man who had the nerve
to stay until the close of the meeting
in spite of the numerous bints that
mere man had no place at the
meeting yesterday.
Club members stylishly gowned,
wearing modish winter hats of trans
parent brims, with fur-covered edges,
wore close listeners to the lecture on
the "Standardization of Style" by Mrs.
L. L. Ilernard. They watched closely
he demonstration of the standardized
dress and then questioned Miss- Hon
zone, its originator, about the method
of making, the cost and the general
usefulness.
Would Abolish Coin pel it ion.
Mrs. . Bernard presented facts and
figures on the history of dress and
dross loform. She advocated taking
women's dress out of fashion and com
petition to save the time, money and
nercj thus expended. The advan-
age she urged was that the modern
woman could dovo'e her tune to
really valuable social service.
Mrs. Ilernard is of the opinion that
the dress designed by Miss Honzono
is 'almost id.nl for the purpose.
Miss Honzono explained how lb
standardized dress is made, its com
fort, cost, durability and beauty. Stu
dents of the home economics depart
ment wore the dresses they made in
class. Standardization or other wear
ing apparel also is advocated by the
originators of the idea.

About $17 was contributed by mem
bers of the ckih yesterday for the
maintenance of the Columbia Public
Library. The Tuesday Club lias had

R. W. JONES AS A RII'I.O.HAT
The road bill authorizing an ex
penditure of $2.".."..,ioii.oiMi annually as
Federal aid in the construction and
maintenance or rural postal routes
and public highways, introduced by
Congressman I). W. Sliackloford from
this district or .Missouri, passed in the
House .vesterday by a vote or 2S1 to 81.
The Rill passed in the House once
before but was debated in the Senate.
-Many believe it will suffer another
defeat when it goes to the Senate this
time.
Opinions difTer as to the result of
the bill if it passes.
Colonel .1. A. Hudson rears that it
would result in a political handling or
the money, with little real benefit to
the state roads. He said that his un
derstanding ot the bill was that $S0
would he spent yearly on each mile or
the high-class roads in the state. He
said that the amount decreased lor the
poorer roads, so that the highways
that iKirded maintenance and con
struction tiie most would receive the
least amount of money.
"The state receives about $400,000
a year from the automobile taxes
which is supposed to go to the road
fund," said Colonel Hudson, "but few
isihle results can be seen.
"I understand that after the money
which the Shackleford bill would pro
vide is sent to the states, it is appor
tioned by the goiernor. This would
mean that it would be spent where it
would get the most votes."
Other load advocates see in the bill
an oHieicnt moans or improving roads.
The bill was debated ill the House
all day under the file-minute rule.
several am udmeuts being adopted.
One (r these proposed by the Commit
tee on Roads, or which Representative
Shackleford is chairman, met with
much opposition. It would give the
state highway commissioners author
ity to say exactly where money shall
be spent. largely curtailing the con
trol of the fund by the Secretary or
Agriculture, according to its critics.
Despite the charge that this amend
ment would make road work in the
states purely a matter of politics, the
amendment was adopted. Among
those who opposed it were Repre
sentatives Dyer and Itorland of Mis
souri, both of whom voted for the bill
is a. whole.

"Well, I should say not!" instantly
exclaimed the girl, blushing. "I've

That Jones is a diplomat as well as
a news-getter was proved by his abil

Is the simple hairdress of the co

three years, soon to be given up for
purfs and curls? Columbia hair
dressers say that, along with the pic
turesque rashioiis or the thirties, the
wearing or artificial hair is coming
back into style. Hair puffs, switches,
and coquettish ringlets which form a
fringe on the neck or full gracefully
from one or both sides of a chignon
are again to be worn.
