Sir i:ivanl Gray. British foreiffil
minister, assorted that the ;ioverii
nient has no intention of deelar
ins; a blockade o Germany.
London. Jan. 2 6. The British gov
ernment has virtually decided to stand
pat on its present trade regulations
and will make no announcement of a
blockade of the entire German coast
in parliament this afternoon, the ma
jority of well informed parliamentary
writers agreed today.
Only a f w papers duns to the be
lief that the cabinet will announce a
redical chance of policy. The net
thrown about Germany by existing
regulations may be tightened in some
respects. But it was the general be
lief of the newspapers that the cabi
net has decided asainst so revolu
I
tionary a change in policy.
The storm of protest caused in ttit
United States and Sweden, some of ,
the newspapers broadly hinted, has
cooled the ardor of advocates of the j
blockade, if it has not had its effect.
upon the government. The newspa-1
pers gave prominent display to trie
warlike utterances of the Swedish pre
mier in his eichstasr speech yesterdwy
and the Daily Telegraph and the Daily
S
News cautioned the gover
Hgainst anv action likely to
Great Britain with neutrals.
Need United suites KcfeourccH.
"Firebrands of the ' prew have de
manded that we brush neutrals out of
our path with a strong hand, but
what will be the position of the en
tente allies if the vast resources of the
Tinted States ceiiws to bp at our com
mand ?" demanded the News.
"There is reason to believe that the i
foreign .secretary will announce this
afternoon that the government has I
reached no important derision with j
reference to a change of our policies, "
said th Telegraph. "This country
may be content with the present nieas- !
ures, which, if apparently slow, are j
Hurt and which hitherto have been j
adopted wit h out any severance of j
friendly relations with the neutral j
powers. We have had experience with
the possible consei nonces of imperious
and overbearing conduct." i
Formal debate on the blockade issue
is expected to open with the introduc- j
ing of a resolution indorsing such a j
drastic step by Sir Arthur Shirley ,
Hcnti, conservative. Sir Edward Gray
was counted upon to answer for the !
government with a sweeping denial of j
the charge that the present "block- I
ale" lias been ineffective.
NGLAND REPLIES
Delivers Temporary Answer to

Will Solicit France's Opinion
Before Final Response.
London, Jan. i!6. The foreign of
fices handed to the American am
bassador today an ad interim reply to
the American protest against deten
tion of mails. The note states that a
formal answer to the representations
ot the Cnited States, will be made as
soon as the French government has
signified its approval of the attitude
ot (ireat Britain.
H is understood the formal renlv
will defend the action of the British
authorities by citing evidence that
Germans have been abusing the privi
leges of first c lass mails. The British !
government will rely on the postal
conventions adopted at The Hague I
for justification of its measures. !
The United States protested to j
C.reat Britain last month against in
terference with mails between this;
country and Sweden. Large quan
tities of mail matter, particularlv par
cel post packages have been takon
from a number of steamships which
were detained in Britsh ports on voy

Mikado Desires Japanese to Act
as Military Advisers.
London, Jan. 26. The Japanese
government has delivered to the Chi
nese minister in Tokio, for transmis
sion to his government, a note em
bodying seven demands which were
included in the Japanese program of
last spring, the Manchester Guardian
learns from far eastern sources.
On January 18, 1915, Japan pre
sented to China a list of twenty-one
demands arranged in five groups. The
first group related to the Shantung
province and to the conceding to Jap
an of rights and privileges previously
enjoyed by Germany in Shantung as
well as new prerogatives.
The Jap Demands.
Group two related to South Man
churia and to concessions there for
leasing of property, trading, railroad
operation and construction, the ap
pointment of Japanese as political,
financial and military advisers . and
other concessions. This group also
included demands for special rights to
be granted to Japanese regarding in
ner Mongolia. Group three referred
to the Hanyeh-Ping company. Group
4, known as the ''special group" de
manded that China prociam that
hereafter she would not yield or lease
any coastal territory to any power.
Group five, known as the general
group was the one which aroused
most vigorous protest from the Chin

BOOST FOR MARSH
Topeka Santa Fe Man To Be
Made Asst Gen'l F't Agent.
R. B. Cunningham Promoted to
Division Freight Agent,
Effective ' February 1, B. F. K.
Marsh, division freight agent of the
Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe railway,
will become assistant general freight
agent of the road with headquarters- in
Topeka. On the same day, R. B. Cun
ningham, private secretary to J. R.
Koontz, general freight agent, will be
made division freight agent to suc
ceed Marsh.
This change of the freight depart
ment under the supervision and ap
pointment of J. R. Koontz, general
freight agent, gives Topeka another
office of the road. The office of as
sistant general freight agent given to
Marsh is created to facilitate the work
in this tenitory. It is the third as
sistant general freight agency under
Mr. Koontz. R. G. Merrick and J. C.
Burnett have been assistant general
freight agents in Topeka for a num
ber of years. Other offices of this
kind are located at Chicago and a com
bination freight and passenger "assist-
ancy at Amanlio, Texas.
B. F. E. Marsh has been in Topeka
many years. He has worked up from
minor positions in the freight depart
ment to division freight agent, a posi
tion he has held for the last eight
years. . Cunningham has been in To
peka several years as private secre
tary to General Freight Agent Koontz.
The move comes as a deserving
recognition to two faithful employees
of the road.
When this story appeared in the
noon edition, J. R. Koontz, general
freight aent. called the State Journal
by telephone and said that the report
of the appointments was unauthorized.
"No changes in the freight department
have been announced, and the item
will embarrass the gentleman named,"
he said.

Old Bootblack
Out of Fortune
New York, Jan. 24. "John the .
Bootblack," was found dead in his
room last night. His real name, '
which few knew, was John Cuneo.
He was 60 years old at least.
For a long period John had
been shining boots in the finan
cial district, adding a polish to
millionaires. It is believed that
John had amassed a fortune that
sufficed him; $30 was sewn in -an
old coat; a bank book show
ed savings of 52,757.40, another
$571.40. A trip to Italy where
John planned to end his days in
affluence was soon to be taken.
Steamship schedules were on the
table in the sparsely furnished
room.
Dr. Haines of Hudson street
hospital, said John had been dead
three days. No one missed him
in that time.

Inclement Weather Keeps Many

Petitions for clemency or any other
kind of petitions presented to district
judges were condemned by the jur
ists today at their ninth annual meet
ing in the supreme court rooms.
Judge C. A. Smart of Ottawa, oldest
ludge in point of service present,
brought up the discussion which led
to the universal condemnation of pe
titions to jurists.
"I would like to say something
about this petition business,' said
Judge Smart. 'It is a deplorable slate
of affairs when a judge acts according
to the length or shortness of a peti
tion. Few people realize what they
are signing when they place their
name on a petition.
An Example.
"For example a petition asking for
a parole signed by the county cotn
misioners, sheriff and other officer
was presented' to me the other day.
In drawing up the paper a mistake
had been made and instead of asking
a parole for a prisoner, the petition
asked that the county officials be pa
roled. Yet people signed it.
Judge J. O. Kankin of Olathe told
of receiving petitions containing 400
names at various times during his ju
dicial career. Often the names of
prominent persons appeared on the
papers, the judge admitted, but many
times these same persons came around
to him privately and asked the judge
not to act on the plea of the petition,
saying that they had signed it merely
for policy's saka.

AGREE TO ACTION
Labor Convention Approves
Acts of Parliament.
Unions to Assist English Gov
ernment in War Moves.
Bristol, Jan. 26. The British labor
conference adopted today, by a vote
of 1,847,000 against 206, U00, a resolu
tion entirely approving- the action of
the parliamentary labcr party in co
operating with other political parties
in the national recruiting campaign.
Representatives of more than 2,
000,000 members of trades unions met
here today to decide the attitude of
organized labor toward the war and
compulsory military service.
The compulsory service bill before
the house of lords was attacked by j
the president of the conference, Wil
liam Anderson, who has opposed the
bill in parliament. He declared it did
not redeem the pledge of Premier As
quith regarding compulsion.
"No words can offer immunity
from danger," he said. ""We cannot
have forced military service without
the risk of forced industrials service."
Mr. Anderson said there was dan
ger in Great Britain's attempting the
impossible by seeking to be simultan
eously a great naval, military and in
dustrial power.
Pledge to Assist.
The first resolution was moved by
James Sexton on behalf of the Na
tional Union of Dock Workers. The
resolution expressed 'the horror of
the conference at the atrocities com
mitted by Germany and her allies,"
and pledges the conference to assist
the government as far as possible to
prosecute the war successfully. Mr.
Sexton said he was opposed to mili
tarism, but that the war must be won.
"If Germany wins," he continued,
! "nothing else on God's earth mat
ters."
Ramsay McDonald, labor member
of parliament, appealed for tolera
tion. He deprecated such a contro
versial resolution, which, he said, was
calculated to interfere with labor's
previous comradeship and fighting a
common enemy. Sexton's motion was
adopted by a card vote of 1,502,000
against 602,000.
