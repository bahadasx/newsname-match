Restored to Their Regular Dividend
Status of Five Per Cent by
Disbursement.
ACTION WAS FORESHADOWED
NEW YORK. Jan. 23. United
States Steel common shares were re
stored to their regular dividend
status of u per cent today when the
directors unanimously declared a
quarterly disbursement ot 1 per
cent out of earnings for the last
quarter of 1915. Total earnings of
$51,232,788 for the three months
were the largest for any similar pe
riod In the history of the corpora
tion, exceeding the previous record,
made In the second quarter of 1907,
by $5, 729, OSS.
The statement or earnings, no less
than the action on the dividends,
was In line with popular expecta
tions, forecasts having rt. lined from
$48,000,000 to $55,000,000, al
though the latter figure was re
garded as rather . extravagant.
Action 1 nrmhidoirrd,
That some fair rate of dividend
would be declared was foreshadowed
in the recent decision of the corpo
ration to increase the wages of its
unskilled laborers by 10 per cent.
nd the offering of the common stock
to employes on the nrof it-sharing
plan at 85.
The corporation's financial position may
he Judged from the fact that It now has
cash In banks ampuntlng to SlOC.OOO.OOti,
while its surplus for the last quarter of
mi amounts to more than $23,000,000.
against a deficit of $5,600,000 in the corre
sponding quarter of the previous year.
In detail the report for the last quarter
of 1915 ahows total earnings of 151.232.788,
net Income of HO.S53.11S and surplus of
$1.3"0.692. These figures compare with
total earnings of S38.710.M4, net income of

WASHINGTON. Jan.. 25. Un
qualified, nonpartisan supoprt ot
military preparedness was urged to
day by Minority Leader Mann In a
ringing speech on the floor of the
house. He was heartily and repeat
edly applauded by both sides of the
chamber.
While It has been understood that
most of the republicans favored
army and navy Increases, until to
day none of their leaders had spoken
on the subject. Consequently, com
ing as it did, on the eve of the presi
dent's departure on a preparedness
speaking tour, Mr. Mann'a address
was regarded as particularly signlfl
cant. He remarked himself that he
always had been known as a "small
army and navy man."
Representative Mann baaed his plea on
the ground that it behooves the United
States now to prepare for any eventuali
ties that may come-as a result of the
European war. He declared that he saw
now Immediate danger of war and hoped
that peace might prevail, but that the
danger of the United States being drawn
into the present conflict or one that might
result from It was too great to be disre
garded. .
"I have much more fears In the end
of war with England than I have of war
with Germany," he said. That was his
only comment on this phase of his sub
ject. Later he declined to elaborate on
his remarks.
Time to Prepare,
Mr. Mann urged no particular prepared
ness plan. He said he favored a standing
army of 180,000 or 300,000 or even 600,000
men, better coast defense and "a navy
which will be able to defend us on the
sea. He promised to go into tnese ae-
tatls at greater length later.
Mast Provide Forces.
"I think we ought to provide these great
forces," said he In pleading for a non
partisan view of the question, "that It
ought to. be considered, an emergency
matter entirely apart froin .the., ordinary
routine or expense ot government, with
out regard to partisanship or party lines."
Touching on the cost, Mr. Mann said It
would be millions now, but better that
than billions later.

lJNDOX, Jan. 23. Four thousand
Turks, Including fifty officers, were cap
tured by the Russians In the recent
battle In the neighborhood of Erxerum,
according to advices from Petrograd to
Renter's Telegram company. The Russians
are also said to have captured scores of
machine guns and enormous Quantities
of munitions. The Reuter dispatch says:
"The rout of the Turks In the battle
which resulted in them being driven into
Erxerum appears from later accounts
to have been even more decisive than
shown In the .first reports. Apart from
the Ottoman losses In actual battle, the
Russians captured during the pursuit
fifty officers and 4,000 men. They also
took s 00 res of machine guns and enor
mous quantities of munitions.
"The Influx of 120,000 Turks in Erserum

where the line swerves to the south. The
fact that the read runs into Colorado and

The application of the increased rate of
4-10 cents per mile was commenced Jan

ber of animals annually."
Marketlaar le Bl Problem.
Mr. Heard urged the question of
marketing be given careful consideration.
"Conditions of the live stock Industry
generally during the laat year have not
been entirely satisfactory." he said.
"There has been general d'scontent,
especlslly among feeders In the Mis
sissippi vsllry, who complain of unstable
prices snd abnorma) fluctuations In ths

frlst. a shortage of cattle In proportion
to the population, as campared with the

The excess receipts at central markets
were less thsn 4 per cent over the pre

market.
"It would seam that the beef market
of 1915 should have been stronger than

LONDON. Jan. 2o.-The demand of the
preas for a more stringent blockade is
reinforced today by a letter from Ad
miral Lord Beresford of Metemmeh and
Curraghmor.
The conviction is gaining ground,"
says Lord Iteresford. "that had the stavy

been ended so mo months ago. The gov

"Owing to nan, of dcvUiun and pio.ui t ,

Lord Beresford in illustrating what be

8TOCKHOLM, Sweden, Jan. 2 4.
(Via London, Jan. 25.) Mainte
nance of neutrality In conformity
with the principles of International
law was the keynote of all the
speeches before both houses of Par
liament today, when debate on the
budget was opened. Leaders ot all
parties dwelt on the vital unanimity
of the Swedish people in favoring
firm and Impartial neutrality. Pre
mier Hammarskjoeld declared this
to be the' policy ot the "government.
but he added:- -f-.;
: "V repudlito the idea than our policy
means we will . not abandon neutrality
.'under any conditions.--It Is our fervent
desirq te keep peace, and It la our duty to
work for this end with all our might, but
we must also reckon with eventualities
in which maintenance of peace. In spite
of all our efforts, would mo longer be
profitable." '
Co-operates with Otfcera.'
Sweden, the premier continued, has en
deavored constantly to co-operate with
other neutrals, pattlcularly Denmark and
Norway, to promote common alms. In
these efforts gwtden has been successful
to a considerable degree, he aaid, adding:
'We regret thst these united efforts
for the rights and welfare of neutral
powers and for preservation, as men
tioned in th spuech from tho throne, of
the lnherltanco of international law
should depend on circumstances ever
which we have no control, and to Judge
which we have no right.
"But It Is our conviction that the suo
cess of such efforts .would be to the ad
vantage, materially and ideally, not only
of Sweden, but of other neutral countries
and of belligerents.
1 "The t present grouping of the powers
will not be eternal. In other circum
stances a' belligerent perhaps will be very
sorry that it baa for the sake of an often
doubtful '-and. temporary advantage torn
up treaties and provisions of Interna
tional law when it Is too late to restore
them." '''','''
Cialaa Woild Be Temporary.'
The premier admitted that certain In
conveniences, especially of a comniorelil
nature, might have been mitigated If the
government hal betn less schupulous In
regard to absolute and impartial neu
trality.. . . ,
"However, xperience . has shown us,"
be continuod, "that in view of the per
petual and raiild aggravation of the com
mercial war ono can depend for only a
short lime on tho rrecarloua enjoyment
of advantages procured by such arrange
ments. Other nmilrala also have learned
from eaerlence that conceaslons merely
