Germ Diseases.
In the course of his talk G. W. Barnes,
who is of the University of Arizona,
nsrussed the diseases which stock
men should most carefully guard
. gainst, among them black leg, anthrax,
'lumpy Jaw" and tuberculosis.
"These are germ diseases," said Mr.
Barnes, "and stockman cannot exer
cise too much care to keep their herds
free of them. Every time a dead ani
mal Is found steps should be taken to
Iarn the cause of death and if It is
determined that there are germs pres
ent the carcass should be destroyed by
burning or burial in order that the
germs may not be carried to other por
tions of the range and to other mem
bers of the herd."
The speaker dwelt at length upon
the necessity of keeping the ranges as
clean as the farmer should endeavor
to keep his stables and home pastures.
He pointed out that many epidemics of
deadly diseases might have been pre
ented if the range masters had exer
cised ordinary care to see that the
germs of the disease had not been car
ried to uninfected pastures by buz
zards, coyotes and other scavengers.

British Talk of "Another St. Helena" For
WHISTL
The War At a Glance
THE attitude of British labor
toward compulsory military
service will be decided at a
great conference today in BristoL
The debate on the question of a
blockade of Germany Is before the
house of commons.
The compulsory military service
bill, having passed the house of
commons and encountered little op
position in the house of lords, the
outcome of the long campaign on
this issue will depend largely on
the attitude of organized labor.
There are intimations, unofficial
in nature, that the British govern
ment has decided against a formal
blockade of Germany.
The Austrian drive down the
eastern coast of the Adriatic, hav
ing passed beyond the Montenegrin
herder. Is now said to hae resulted
in the capture of an Albanian sea

DEBATES ON WAR
Strong Opposition to Com
pulsory Military Service
is Voiced by Speakers.
Bristol. Eng Jan. 26. The represen
tatives of more than 2,000,000 members
of trades unions met here today to de
cide the attitude of organized labor to
ward the war and, in particular, toward
compisory military service.
Early in the proceedings an attack
on the compulsory service bill, now
before the house of lords, was made by
the president of the conference. Win.
Anderson, member of parliament for
the Attercliffe division of Sheffield.
Mr. Anderson, who has opposed the bill
in parliament, declared that tt did not

regarding compulsionx --
! Threat to Labors
"No form of words. can offer immu
nity from danker." He said. "We can
not have forced military eervice with
out the risk of forced industrial ser
vice. Any attempt to use this weap
on to coerce trade unionists will lead
tn preat hittprness and end in failure."
Mr. Anderson said the world would
be different after the war. adding:
"It will be a hard and bad world for
labor unless labor takes a hand in
shaping it."
HOUSE OF COMMONS IS
DEBATING ON BLOCKADE
London. Eng., Jan. 2S. Experts and
self-stvled experts on the law of mari
time war on commerce mobilized in
the house of commons this. afternoon
for the eagerly awaited debate on the
mearures to be taken for a Tilockade
against Germany.
Critics of the government's policy
and the defenders thereof were equally
insistent on the necessity of enforcing
"a blockade as effective as possible."
but they joined issue on the best meth
od of enforcing this, a keen desire
being shown in some quarters to make
the interference with neutral commerce
as light as possible.
The debate hinged on a motion as
follows; .
"That this house, having noted the
volume of exports into neutral coun
tries bordering on enemy territorv of
goods essential to the enemy for the
prosecution of war, urges the govern
ment to enforce as effective a blocK
ade as possible without Interfering
with the normal requirement of those
neutral countries for internal con
sumption." WAR PRISONERS IN SIBERIA

"There were about 58.000 prisoners

Get 2000 Tons of Supplies to
Prison Camps in Siberia
and Send Men to Aid.
Tien-Tsin, China, Jan. 26 More than
2000 tons of clothing and other sup
plies for Germans interned in Siberia
have been shipped from Tien-Tsin to
Vladivostok by the American Red Cross.
At the request of Dr Paul S. Reinseh,
the American minister to China, R. JL
Burr, of the facultv of Peiyang uni
versity located in Tien-Tsin, and Dr.
Charles Siler. physical director of the
Tien-Tsin Toung Men's Christian as
sociation have gone to Siberia to assist
in the distribution of supplies.
William Warfield, the special repre
sentative delegated by the American
state department to inspect prison
camps in Siberia, and Frederick A.
Sterling, formerly second secretary of
the American legation in Pekin and
now specially assigned to Petrograd,
will also cooperate in this relief work.
John K. Caldwell, the American consul
at Vladivostok, is in charge of the dis
tribution of money for the relief of the
interned Germans in Siberia, and most
of the relief work will be directed from
Vladivostok. The Interment camps and
prisons camps are chiefly located far
west of Vladivostok and most of them
are some distance from the Trans-Siber-an
Railway line. Consequently,
the work of distribution is extremely
difficult.
Many of the supplies sent for the re
lief of Germans in Siberia last winter
did not reach the camps until spring.
The Trans-Siberian railway is so con
gested with supplies for the army that
all other freight is sidetracked for arms
and ammunition and troop trains.
In addition to clothing, the Ameri
can Red Cross is also sending much
medicine and many medical supplies
of various kinds' into Siberia Typhoid
serum is greatly needed because of the.
prevalence of fever jn many of the
camps. Typhoid has been checked
largely by the cold weather, hnt with

CARRANZA PUTS NEW LAND
LAW IN EFFECT IN YUCATAN
Constitutionalist land laws, provid

earliest opportunity, according to Car
ranza officials.
The first report of the actual institu
tion of the new laws has arrived" at the
local Mexican consulate, to the effect
that in the state of Yucatan a decree,
dated January 16, has been issued, to
be followed by similar mandates! in the
other states, calling for the immediate
putting into effect of the proposed re
systematizing of land seizures and re
distributions. In Yucatan the new decree provides
for the government seizure of waste
lands and lands owned, but not culti
vated by the owners, to be distributed
again among small farmers and set
tlers on 50 year payments, it also pro
vides for the calling of citizens' meet

pose of which shall be to loan money

HERE u a big feature that will be printed in the El Paso Herald shortly .
We discovered that DeWitt B. Luess. the greatest authority on

series of articles on graphology for the Philadelpiia Sorth American. an.l
the results had been phenorainal. We ininiedis,tely arranged w ith Mr. Luca
to prepare a series for us.
It consists of eight articles under the general title, "A Man Is Known
by His Handwriting.'' g
A series on graphology by so famous an authority as Mr. Lucas will
be bound to arouse intense interest. The natural effect will be to make
thousands of readers eager to secure character readings of themselves and
their friends. ExpectiBg to receive an enormous number of letters asking
how expert readings might be obtained The Herald has arranged for this.
By sending in one or more coupons, with, specimens and a small fee,
the reader may obtain readings of his own character and the characters of his
friends. A coupon is to be published with each article.
This coupon, if filled out and sent to The Herald with 50 cents is stamps,
together with a sample of your writing, will be forwarded to Prof. Lucas,
who will give you a personal reading.
This series should appeal to the-greatest 'possible number of mea, women
