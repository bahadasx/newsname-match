Wellesley Is Stirred Up
by Her Plea For a Man
Special to the Telegraph
Wellesley, Mass.. Jan. 26.—Welles
ley College girls are very much dis
turbed over the verses of a senior,
whose name Miss Miriam Yidder, ed
itor of the College News, refuses to
divulge, but who in last week's issue
called loudly in poetry for a man. Two
verses are:
"I'd give my month s allowance for a
man.
Or, having spent it, I'll give up what
« I can.
For what is prom without a young
recruit,
A tall Apollo in a full dress suit.
To pilot down the receiving line.
While your proprietary smile says
'He's mine'?
"And yet I've reached the end of my
resources; \
I cannot tind a man by human forces.
O you who have a c orner on the brand
That's known as Homo Sapiens, my
demand
Must move your stony heart until it
grants
A single man—no need for 'sapiens' if
he dance!"
"The verses cast suspicion on all of 1
us," said one senior, who has a flock
of young men in her train.
"Bud." Alaskan Collie,
Has a Regular Funeral
No longer will the children of the
families residing in the vicinity of
Swatara and Crescent streets romp and
play with the neighborhood pet,
"Bud." the sleek-coated white and tan
Alaska collie, that for years ha.s been
their pride.
"Bud." owned by Mr. and Mrs.
James E. Dick. 418 Crescent street, is
dead. Also he has been buried—that's
why this is written. '"Bud" had a
regular funeral.
In a coffin lined with soft ribbons
and carnations the body of "Bud" was
placed. All his equipment, i-ollars, etc..
went with him. Then, while sad-eyed,
almost tearful, youths of the neighbor
hood watched by a draped motor truck
drove up to the Dick home Sunday and
(he coffin was placed aboard. Amid
the sobs of the children the cortege
moved away.
At the home of George Schadt. Mid
dletown, the truck stopped and the
pallbearers bore the "body" to the
burial ground, which was in front of
the Schadt home. The pallbearers In
cluded William Reel, James Dick.

Middletown.

NEARING REALITY
Cunningham and Railroad Of-i
ficials Get Nearer an Under- [
standing at Hearing Today J
"NARROWS" DANGEROUS i
Several Serious Accidents Have
Occurred; To Use Old
Towpath
State Highway Commissioner Cun
ningham and Chief Engineer Uhler
had a conference to-day with officials
of the Northern Central Railway Com
pany regarding the narrow highway
between this city and Sunbury, which
skirts the right of way of the railroad
lines, especially that section between
Dauphin and the Clark's Ferry bridge.
It is understood that the railroad com
pany is desirous of increasing its
trackage and to do so It will be neces
sary to make some arrangements re
garding the present line of the high
way.
Already this voad is a menace to
j travel and positively dangerous owing
ito its proximity to the railroad and
I the narrow width of the highway. The
! road runs along a shelf and there have
been several accidents because of the
abandoned basin of the old canal west
of the roadway.
New Highway Only Remedy
Highway Commissioner Cunningham
and engineers of the department have
made a close study of the situation and
are strongly of the opinion that the
only remedy is the building of a new
highway from Dauphin to Clark's
! Ferry ulong the line of the old tow-
I path. This change would remedy
; present unfortunate conditions and
jalso eliminate three dangerous grade
crossings.
Outlook Is Bright
j At the conclusion of the hearing this
| afternoon it was apparent that the
State and the railroad company are
nearer a solution of the problem now
than ever before.
Some time ago the Pennsylvania
Railroad Company asked the Highway
Department for permission to extend
its tracks between Speeceville and Mll
lersburg through the Narrows. The
department found that the road is only
about twelve to fourteen feet wide
there now and to grant further conces
sions would be to block the highway
i entirely. Therefore the permits were
| held up.
To-day H. P. I.incoln. superlntend
i ent, and E. Brinser, engineer, of
hl>e Willlamsport division, appeared
j before Commissioner Cunningham to
j discuss the matter. The commissioner
'said that after a thorough examina
tion of the records he found that in
I 1 809 a charter had been granted for
!a turnpike company to construct, a
1 road from Harrisburg to Pittsburgh
jby way of Lewistown and Hunttng-
I don and that this charter conferred
| upon the company all ol' the corpor
| ate rights of the turnpike company
I operatin gon the southern route which
! included a road width of fifty feet.
Therefore, he held, the new road
company had a right to a fifty-foot
highway. In 1821 this North Route
road was split up and all of the
charter rights conveyed to the Har
risburg and Millersburg pike, which
includes the stretch of highway in
question, that were formerly held by
j the parent company. The highway
i width remained at 50 feet. . A few
I years later this company went out of
I business and the charter rights re
verted to the township, with the ex
, ception of that giving the privilege
of collecting toll. Thus the township

negotiations, the result of which was

It was understood that such changes

pared to-dav. It. now awaits the ap
proval of the German government.
The next step in the negotiations Is not

Shipping Bill, Tariff Commis
sion and Philippine Amend
ment Are Discussed
LEARNS THEIR ATTITUDE
New Measure Will Provide
That U. S. Buy Ships, Then

By Associated Press
Washington, D. Jan. 2K.—Presi
dent Wilson summoned lo 1 lie White
House to-day lenders of the Seriate and
House to learn their attitude toward
the shipping bill, a tariff commission
and the Philippines. He indicated to
them that in addition to the prepared
ness program and revenue bills those
three measures would be the principal
ones backed by the administration.
Most of the leaders with whom
President Wilson talked to-day op
posed the shipping- bill in the last Con
gress and he desired to know their
position toward the new bill. He saw
Majority Leader Kitchin. of the House,
Chairman Fitzgerald, of the appro
priations committee. Chairman Clarke,
of the Senate commerce committee.
Chairman Simmons, of the Senate
finance committee. and Senator
Fletcher, who led the light for the
ship bill in the Senate in the last Con
gress.
As a result of the conferences to-day
details of the shipping bill which will
be supported by the administration be
came known for the first time. It does
not include the failure of the old bill
providing for continued operation of
ships by the government. Instead if.
provides that the government shall
purchase or build ships and then lease
or sell them to corporations or private
individuals. Only in case no one offers
to lease or buy (he ships does the bill
allow the government to operate them.
Provides for HOIMI Issue
The government could buy back the
ships at a reasonable price for naval
auxiliaries in time of war. A bond

or construction of ships would be pro-
