Review of War Situation.
The position of the British govern
"nient on two matters of prime im
portance In the conduct of the war is
to be determined as a result of pro
ceedings under way today. The atti
tude of labor toward compulsory mili
tary service will be decided at the
great conference meeting today in
Bristol. The debate on the question
of a' blockade of Germany is before
the house of commons.
The Bristol conference is the most
important of this kind ever held in
England, representing more than 2
000,000 members of trades unions.
The compulsory military service bill
having passed the house of commons
and encountered little opposition in
the house of lords the outcome of
the long campaign on this issuo will
depend largely on the attitude of or
ganized labor.
There are intimations, unofficial in
nature, that the British government
has decided against a formal blockade
of Germany.

London Reports Fight.
London, Jan. 26, 6 p. m. The Brit
ish press bureau today gave out the
following communication, dealing
with fighting in Mesopotamia
"From further communications the
recent fighting on the Tigris took
place 23 miles below Kut-el-Amara
and not as previously stated seven
miles from Kut.
"The mistake arose through a mis
understanding at the India office in
connection with the references in the
telegrams to the Es Sinn position
which is known to have been strongly
entrenched.
"There is nothing further to re
port." The statement that the British re
lief force has reached a position only
seven miles from Kut was made in
the house of commons January 20 by
Austen Chamberlain, secretary for In
dia. American Note Arrives.
London, Jan. 26, 1:15 p. m. The
American note regarding Great Brit
ain's -Trading -.With the -Enemy-Act
has arrived here and will be deliv-.
ered to the British foreign office to-'
day.
The act prohibits persons resident
in Great Britain from trading with
any corporations or individuals en
gaged In supplying the Teutonic allies,
or from any business dealings with
them. The United States, in its rep
resentations to Great Britain, contend
the act lacks legal authority and
would Injure the Interests of that
country.
All Dock Yards Busy.
London, Jan. 26, 4:08 p. m. A. J.
Balfour, first lord of the admiralty,
stated in the house of commons to
day that the British government had
no evidence that Germany possessed

GREAT MEETING
OF LABOR MEN
Bristol, England, Jan 26, 6.10 P
m. The British labor conference
adopted today by a vole of 1,847,000
against 206,000 a resolution entirely
approving the action of the parliamen
tary labor party in co-operating with
other political parties in the national
recruiting campaign.
Bristol, England, Jan. 26. 1:30 p.
m. The representatives of moro than
two million members of trades unions
met here today to decide the attitude
of organized labor toward the war
and in particular in compulsory mili
tary service.
Early In the proceedings an attack
on the compulsory service bill now
before the house of lords was made
by the president of the conference,
William Anderson, member of parlia
ment for the Attercliffe dhision of
Shefield. Mr. Anderson, who has op
posed the bill In parliament, declared
that It did not redeem the pledge of
Premier Asquith regarding compul
sion. Great Danger Ahead.
"No form of words can offer im
munity from danger," he said. "Wo
cannot have forced military service
without the risk of forced industrial
service. Any attempt to use this
weapon to coerce trade unionists will
lead to great bitterness and end in
failure."
Mr. Anderson said thero was dan
ger in Great Britain "attempting the
impossible" by seeking to be simul
taneously a great naval, a great mili
tary and a great industrial power."
He said the world would be differ
ent after the war, adding:
"II will be a hard and a bitter
world for labor unless labor takes .
a hand In shaping it."
The first resolution was moved by I
James Sexton, on behalf of the Na
tion Union of Dock Workers. The
resolution expresses "the horror of
the conference at the atrocities com
mitted by Germany and her allies,"
and pledges the conference to assist
the government as far as possible to
prosecute the war successfully.
War Must Be Won.
Mr. Sexton said he was opposed to
militarism, but that the war must be
won.
"If Germany wjns," he continued,
"nothing else on God's earth mat
ters." Ramsay MacDonald, labor member
of parliament, appealed for toleration.
Pie deprecated such a controversial
resolution which, he said, was calcu
lated to Interfere with labor's prev
ious comradeship and unity in fight
ing a common enemy.
Mr. Sexton's motion was adopted
by a card vote of 1,502,000 against
602.000.
The session of the labor conference
will laBt three days.
Tension among the delegates who
represent upwards of two million
workers, was evident from the mo
ment W. H. Ayles, a local labor lead
er, in welcoming the congress, re
marked that the members of the party
in Bristol neither had the time nor
the inclination to engage in recruit
ing. Mingled applause and dissent greet
ed the remark and the situation was
further heated by John Hodge, mem
ber of parliament for the Gorton dl
jsion of Lancashire, who protested
against this introduction of a debat
able subject in the official welcome.
The presidential address of Mr.
Anderson did little to allay the suspi
cions of those delegates who have
been making a tight against compul
sion. "Militarism and democracy cannot
live together In Germany or any
where," was one of the presiding offi
cer's opening sentences and was much
applauded. Mr. Anderson proceeded
to remark:
"There are signs of a great reac
tion in this country. Mr. Lloyd
George, who apparently would like to
see the rules of the army applied to
the workshops, made a not very suc
cessful attempt by means of the muni
tions act."

HEROIC RETREAT

Overwhelming Force.
FALL CAUSES SURPRISE
Durazzo and Avlona Believed
to Be Safe From Sud
den Blow.
Rome, Jan. 25, via Paris, Jan 26,
4:05 a. m. A dispatch from San Gio
vanni di Medua to the Idea Nazionale
says that the Montenegrins made a
determined stand on Mount Tarabo
sche in an effort to save the city of
Scutari but that the approach of a
strong Austrian column forced the
detachment on the mountain to re
treat. The women, it is stated, con
ducted themselves as heroically as
the men, carrying on their backs dur
ing the retreat everything that was
necessary to continue the struggle.
Fall Causes Surprise.
Although the fall of Scutari was dis
counted by the Italian public, the sud
denness with which it was brought
about has caused much surprise. Keen
interest Is manifested in political cir
cles regarding the entireAlbauian
question. Baron Sonnino, the Italian
foreign minister, had a long confer
ence this morning with the king and it
is understood that at the meeting of
the Italian cabinet tomorrow certain
features of the Albanian question will
be discussed, although it is expected
that definite decisions of importance
will be arrived at, as the question is
an International one and must be set
tled by agreement of the allies.
Military experts affirm that no im
mediate anxiety is felt for Durazzo
which Is understood to be satisfac
torily defended by Essad Pasha, nor
for Avlona, which Is believed to be
safe from a sudden blow.

GREAT DANGER AHEAD
Will Be Hard and Bitter World
Unless Labor Takes Hand
in Shaping.
London, Jan. 25. The Germans and
the allies are at grips in Flanders in
one of the most gigantic artillery
duels in history. An apparent attempt
of tho Germans to repeat their his
toric "drive on Calais" In the fall of
1914 and the spring of 1915 has been
challenged by the allies with all the
onergy of their months of accumula
tion of munitions.
At only one point has either side
essayed an infantry attack. This was
near Neuvlllc St. Vaast, where the
Germans attacked on a 1500-yard
front. The French trenches were
shattered, small captures of men and
guns were made and a section of tho
French first JIne trenches were pene
trated, but counter-attacks again
cleared the tumbled works and the
French maintained their position.
Starting with a bombardment of
Nieuport, at the mouth of the Yser,
by the German batteries, the artillery
duel has spread along the whole of
the Yser front almost to Ypres.
The French artillery, acting In con
cert with the British, today carried
out a violent bombardment of the
German works southeast of Boes
Inghe, inflicting serious damage, says
tonight's Paris communique.
German shell fire has destroyed the
templar tower and cathedral of Nieu
1 ort, which the Germans claim was
being used by the allies as an obser
vation post.
Behind the allied lines German avia
tors bombarded Dunkirk, half way
along the coast between Nieuport and
Calais.
The British report of operations to
night says:
"Today we carried out successful
artillery bombardments near Ovillers,
La Boiselle, Le Brieboux and Boes-inghev-aWear
the last named placed
wo exploded a bomb store in the Ger
man lines.
"The hostile artillery has shown ac
tivity near Gommecourt, about Loos
and Alhooge
"Aircraft of both sides have been
active. We maintained our suprem
acy." . rtn

"The retreat of our troops from Al

Those who suffered most will soon be
sent to places where they will be
caied for, reorganized and rearmed.
As for the others, if they are kept
supplied, you may be sure they will
continue the campaign in Albania
with vigor. They will give the en
emy some unpleasant surprises, for
in Albania the roads and paths can
be defended by small numbers of men
and It is simply a question of trans
ports and supplies and you alone, the
allies, can solve the problem.
"Give us enough to eat and we shall
hole on and we shall fight I am
certain that with you and by your
aid we shall triumph. I repeat that
we are absolutely sure that the allies
will triumph and our one wish is to
be able to contribute to the great
