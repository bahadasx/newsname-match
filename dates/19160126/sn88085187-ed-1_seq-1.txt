MR. T- H- MARTIN, PLAIN ZOB
Mr. T. H. Martin is coming back to Tacoma in a

Let's show him how we appreciate his work.

Mr. T. H. Martin, for the benefit of those who
have forgotten, is the former secretary of the Com
mercial club.
He has been in Washington for several weeks
lobbying in the interest of Rainier National park,
or, at least, of the syndicate which expects to run
all the concessions there hereafter.
It is supposed he is to be general manager for
the concern.

He took back with him the "tWmr-Hours-to-the

This he showed, among others, to the National
Press club, of Washington.

TACOMA
SUICIDE
GHASTLY
One of the most uncanny sui
cides in Tacoma for many years
came to light this morning when
the body of Jens Peterson, a mill
worker, was found hanging from
a rope in the drying room on the
fourth floor of the St. Paul * Ta
coma Lumber Co.'s boarding
house.
Peterson, 65 years of age, re
cently had sustained Injuries to
his arm which had prevented him
from working.
For several days he has spent a
good deal of time In the drying
room.
Consequently it occasioned no
surprise to the other boarders
this morning to see him apparent
ly standing with his back to the
pipes.
When he made no move, after
many minutes, and gave no reply
t/ .iiiesilons, an investigation
was titarted.
He was seen to be dead, and a
rope was found about bis neck.
Its presence waa cleverly conceal
ed by bis coat collar.
He lectured about Rainier National park and
Mt. Rainier to this club, consisting of newspaper
correspondents representing papers the country
over and the world over.
• # *
Yes, we know we said Mt. Rainier; that is what
we meant to say. For, you see, we are quoting Mr.
i T. H. Martin, and that is what he said.
He told the club all about the dispute over the
name, the silly dispute which arose when Taco
i mans insisted on using the old Indian name.
, Mr. T. H. Martin told the club that "the time
i honored feud" had been laid; that "Seattleites and
Tacomans have agreed together to speak of the
• mountain always hereafter aa Rainier;" that ev
eryone, in fact, does it now a days; that such pro
vincials localisms as "Mt. Tacoma" no longer are
■ done by our best people!

The million dollar runaway

That's what the BteßjMUly told
the public service commission
this morning. They got away
from the company's engineers
when they were making their

erty.

commission are up a tree. For

The runaway was discovered
this morning when the atate and
company engineers, who have
been preparing the apraisals of
the company and the public serv
ice commission, turned ln their
report.
The company's estimate of its
property was shown to be $26,
