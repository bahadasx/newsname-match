"Jews in War Zone Suffer More
Terribly Than Even Belgians!"
jacob H. Schiff, Pleading for American Dollars, so
Declares in Special Article He Writes to
Readers of This Newspaper.
BY JACOB H. SCHIFF.
World-Famous Financier of America and leader lit American Jewish
Relief Committee.
WRITTEN ESPECIALLY FOR THE WEST VIRGINIAN.
Jewish relief day, named, by proclamation of the President In con
formity with a resolution of the United States Senate, originated, in my
opinion, in a desire on the part of a large element ;of our- population to
awaken the compassion of our people to the terrible suffering to which
the Jewish inhabitants of Russia,
the Three Polands, Gallcia and Pal
estine?probably comprising eight
or nine million souls?have been
subjected in consequence of the
world war.
It is not only probable, but cer
tain, that the suffering in Belgium,
in Serbia and in Armenia, which
has properly so deeply aroused the
people of the United States, cannot
be even compared with the misery
that has existed for many months,
and continues to exist in the war
zones just spoken of! A large part
of the Jewish population In these
zones has been made homeless, la
practically without food, and is,
whilst suffering from many dis
eases, even without medicines in
many instances!
It Is needless to Investigate here
who bears the tremendous moral
and actual responsibility for this
state of affairs. It is bad enough
that it exists and that so great a
number of human beings have to
pass through such conditions with
out receiving sufficient succor.
The Jews of the United States,
many of whom have so willingly, i.Tnro-n i-r c,r-i-r-t-c-c :
as they ought to do, Joined their r-L.Ot_rti.hi
follow citizens in providing relief for the suffering in all countries^
volved-ln .Jtlw world war, have already, amongst their own people r
somethlng like $3,000,000 during the<-past-15_mantha to bo applled
the relief of their suffering co-religionists; >.wfro, ujjfQCtoaa^eJy, v.lt' .lB
averred, aro being, in- not'-a 'few 'Instances,? discriminated against by
authorities charged with the dissemination of relief.
If a large part of the human beings Involved In thl8 catas
trophe la not to perish, much larger sums than It has been
possible thus far to raise will have to be obtained, and it Is
now the privilege of the American people to join with their
fellow citizens of the Jewish faith In demonstrating their Inter
est In an effectual manner.
Some New Ideas
About Street Signs
CITY BOARD OF AFFAIR8 NOT IN
A HURRY TO CL08E
CONTRACT8
A number of additional samples of
street signs have been received since
the meeting of the city Board of Af
fairs last Monday and placing the or
der -will bo delayed for several days
longer In order that all bidders may
have an opportunity to be heard.
A sample sign which arrived by ex
press today, strongly constructed of
enameled Iron with galvanized cast
iron letters, pleased the members of
the Board of Affairs. The sign Is doa
ble In construction showing the street
names, and It Is designed to be plac
ed on a post. Prices on thlB sign have
not yet been quoted the board but It
probably will be more costly than the
blue and white enamel signs.
Tha board has under advisement a
plan for nsing these heavier signs on
a few of the downtown corners in con
nection with a cement receptacle for
waste paper.
A sample of a blue and white enam
eled sign at 23% cents delivered t o.
b. Fairmont was received last even
ing from S. G. Adams Stamp and Sta
tionery Co., St. Louis, Mo. Delivery of
the finished signs can be started by
this firm within ten days. On account
of the promise of prompt delivery and
the low price this sign Is retardod fa
vorably by the board.

The Specifications Committee of

plans from the architects, and from
now until'the election of officers of
the company on February 7. will be
busy tabulating and classifying the
plans and sketches of the proposed

No startling Innovations are in any
of the sketches of the new hotel. All
are practical and conservative ideas
of a modern, fire-proof hotel, which
will be comfortable and with every
convenience for the accommodation
of guests.
The plans all call for a building con
structed entirely, of steel;, stone and
brick with the main entrance.on Jeff
erson street. None.'of the plans sub

stories in height from the highest ele

provide for two elevators in the build

Holding Germany to
Strict Accountability
LUSITANIA SETTLEMENT MUST
BE MADE ON A BASIS OF IN
TERNATIONAL LAW
WASHINGTON, Jan. 26.?The Unit
ed States is understood to have reject
ed as being partially unsatisfactory
Germany's latest proposal in the Lus
ltanla negotiations.
In many particulars the \ suggested
form of agreement designed to con
clude the controversy, which was sub
mitted through the ambassador, is ac
ceptable. It' was stated by excelent
authority, however, that the United
States instists upon holding the Ger
man government to "a: strict account
ability" for loss of more than one hun
dred American lives and desires that
the Berlin government admit, in ef
fect, that it is liable according to law,
for the lives of neutrals lost in the
commission of an act against a vessel
of the enomy.
It was indicated tonight that while
Teutonic diplomatic circles were dis
appointed at the refusal of the United
States to accept the proposal, a feel
ing of optimism regarding the out
come still prevailed.
From sources usually ^well inform
ed came tho statement that Germany,
in the proposal, had considered friend
ship for the United States to a great
er extent than law in making such
concessions as have been made. The
administration ? was represented as
talcing the position that law also
should^be brought Into consideration.'

A VARIETYJF APPLES
Idea is to Have Family Or
chard Which Will Supply
the Table.
A fine "family" orchtrd, of between
two and three acres, principally apple
and cherry trees, will be planted on
the Marion county poor farm this
spring, 100 apple trees and a dozen
cherry trees having been ordered by
the county court yesterday from H.
P. Brand, local agent for Hooper
Brothers nursery of Rochester, N. Y.
Much of the land of the county poor,
farm is favorably located for fruit
growing and already an orchard of
several acres provides fruit for the
destitute of the county. Most of the
trees, however, are very old, many of
them decaying so badly as to pro
duce little or no fruit.
The trees to be planted this spring
it is believed, will come into bear
ing -in from eight to 12 years, and
will take the place of the present or
chard.'. Nearly a score of varieties of
apples is included in the order placed
by -the County-court yesterday, includ
ing :the earliest varieties, such as the
Yellow Transparent, Red Astrakhan,
Summer and Fall varieties and late
winter apples- which will keep until
apples cbme" in again in the Spring.
Several' varieties, were' included in
the;Torder .for cherry4 trees. The poor
farm is ample in size and apple treea
require but, JitUe .care >in ? spring

the fruit aids materially in providing

CITES SBME_ HISTORY
Booze Interests Have always
Thrown Strength Against

The address last night of Miss La
vlnla Engle, Held secretary lor the
National Suffrage association, who is
spending some time in this county in
the Interest of the work, was a splen
did one and was enthusiastically re
ceived by a large number of women
and not a few men assembled at the
First Baptist church for the reception
given by the W. C. T. U. of this city.
MIsb Engle dwolt at length an the
part the women of the state of West
Virginia would take in aiding In the
work of keeping West Virginia In the
dry column, and the part they would
take in aiding In the enforcement of
the Yost law, If they are given the
ballot In 1016. ,
Miss Engle stated that In every
state, where suffrage had been' voted
upon, the whiskey Interests threw
their strength against the cause,' and
that the reason,was obvious. Miss En
gle went on i to say that the whiskey
interests were afraid of what the wo
men i would do with the proposition
and. for that reason they were denied
the ballot. She also believes that be
cause West Virginia took the Initiative
In. the' eastern states," in voting for
statewide: prohibition,>iBhe .will also
rally ,tO'the,cqlprs '?ud give her womon
the right tOr.rbte/lriMDlS and thereby
take the Initiative in thlB cause also.
At the conclusion of herjaddress
several, enthusiastic White -rlbboners,
who had heretofore been'Indifferent
about suffrage, announced their Inten
tion of giving the cause the same en
thusiastic support they had hereto
fore given the cause^of prohibition.
i~Miss Engie spent a .part of today In
