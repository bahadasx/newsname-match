PREDICTS RE-ELECTION
OF PRESIDENT WILSON
Finds Abundant Evidences of Prosperity
Ahng Route; Declares Lawton States
man in Line for Speakership
if Clark Drops Out
Judge N. M. Williams who rccent'y
relumed from a pleasant trip of com
bined busines and pleasure to the na
lion's capital, when seen by an Ex
press reporter this morning stated that
le had injoyeil his trip hugely.
"I went to Washington," said Judge
Williams, "by way of Bostou, New
iork and other eastern cities.
"A general air of prosperity was to
be een everywhere. I might oay, an
unprecedented air of prosperity was to
be met with on -very hand. The mer
chant and. tho professional man were
alike, It seemed, bujy and were also
rlike well satisfied with the results
of their being busy."
Judge Williams, owing to rush of
business and the limited time which
he allowed hlimself in Washington, did
net avail himself of the opportunity
which was afforded him of calling
upon President Wilson.
However, Judge Williams spent a
part of Ills tinvj with different mem
bers cf tha Oklahoma delegation iu
congress and expresses himself a
feeling tiiiihly pleased with the stand
in? of this delegation, taken a9 a
whole.
"There is not a state In this union,"
Bald the jude, speaking In this con
nection, which has a delegation in
the halls of the national legislature
islanding higher, or even as high as
does the delegation from this great
new stuto. Taken as a body, the
Oklahoma delegation shows a percent
age of statesmanship far above the
average. Tuken separately, we find
some of the strongest men composing
the p.e-'ci.t congress, In both houses,
belong to the Oklahoma delegation."
1 was pleased to note," continued
Jul;:e Williams, "that our own mem
ber, Scott Ferris, ranks along with
the bent and strongest members of the
present congress. Congressman Fer
ris has bo?n In the nation's legislative
halls at Washington until he has an
acquaintance which is proving mott
valuable to himself individually, as
well as proving to bo no nuan asset
to us Telks hack home.' He is the
chairman of one of the strongest and
hardest worked and working commit
tees of the house."
"To shew you Just how Scott Fer-,
rls stand," said Judge Williams with
li marked degree of enthusiasm," I will
say that I found a good part of the
opinion of his congressional collegium
bo favorable toward him that I believe
were the present speaker of the bouse,
Champ Clark of Missouri to die to
morrow, Scott Ferris, the idol of Okla
homa, would step Into his shoes, both
as executive head of tbe lower branch
of congress and as leader of the great
national democracy in the polities'
bfittles now being waged at the capital
of the I'niled States."
Reverting to the prosperous condi
tions of the country, as seen in the
eastern portions of the country. Judge
Williams mentioned the hustle and
bustle which was in evidence on
every hand. "From Indianapolis to
Pittsburgh," said the Judge, "night
was turned into day by the constant
glare from the' coke ovens and by the
blinding flashes which leaped from
hundreds and thousands of blast fur
naces along the line of railway over
which I traveled."
Judge Williams stated that In his
opinion, based Upon interviews with
tla with whom he was thrown iu
contact at different points along his
journey's route, Woodrow Wilson
would not only walk away with the
nomination of the democracy for prcs-
Mont nf thP United States, succeed
ing himself, but that he now had the
flection "grabbed and gone with"
While in vBHhingtoit Judge Wil
liams called upon his old fr'end, Post-
Burleson and Judge Williams are
graduates of the the same school, the
Texas State university ,
Ceneral Burleson, Judge William
said, is one of the hardest workers
in the entire hard-working family o?
national servants gathered together by
President Wilson. He is almost ab
normally scrupulous, the judge stated
in his adherence to (he performance
of all things which he considers to be
a part of his official duties.
"Yes," concluded Judge Williams, "I
feel that Oklahoma has a ssfe and sane
representation in both branches of
congress and I feel and balieve that
the affairs of the nation could under
no conceivable circumstances be in
better hands than new the hands of
President Woodrow Wilson."
