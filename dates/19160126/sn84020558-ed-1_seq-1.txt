Tl MILITARY SERVICE BILL
AMIES ANOTHER STAGE
Republican A. P. Leaied Wire
LONDON. Jan. 25, 9:25 P. M. The
house of lords without division passed
late today the second reading of the
, lK,"a' .
military service bill.
The Marquis of Lansdowne, minister
without a portfolio, spoke strongly of
the necessity of enacting a measure.
The Archbishop of Canterbury, in
the course of the debate, bestowed a
benediction on the measure, saying he
regarded it as a plain, straightforward,
vigorous effort to meet a situation ex
traordinarily difficult.
Earl CurzonC lord of the privy seal,
in concluding the debate, expressed the
opinion that the most serious criticism
of the bill was made by those who con
tended that it did not go far enough.
Karl Derby, director of recruiting,
said he was convinced that the bill
when imposed on the country would
not make the disturbance in industrial
circles that many had predicted. He
was more frightened by the extent of
the exemptions granted by the govern
ment than by the reductions in men
available for military service made by
the munitions tribunals. Since his re
port was made, four lists of reserved
occupations had been issued, and he
could not help being apprehensive
when he learned that no less than
100,000 badges exempting men from
military service had been issued in
four days last week.
Labor to Be Heard From
BRISTOL. Jan. 25, 8:05 P. M.
Pritish labor will define its position
toward the war and military compul
sion at the most momentous conference
ever held in Great Britain, opening
here tomorrow under the presidency
of William Crawford Anderson, mem
ber of parliament for the Attercliffe
division of Sheffield. More than
2,000,000 laborites will be represented,
among them about 30,000 socialists,
whose anti-war sentiments have been
very strong, assisted by an extensive
propaganda.
The position to be taken by the
miners is considered one of the most
Interesting features of the conference,
a large number of these workers being
opposed to compulsory service. But
their delegates tonight decline to dis
cuss their intentions.
Trading With Enemy Act
LONDON, Jan. 25, 1:15 A. M The
house of commons today passed the
mittee, Mr. Jackson said: "On April
Col. Pryor and myself went to
Washington. Mr. Jastro being un
able to be with us. When we ar
lived we were met by an attorney of
the Cudahy Packing company, who
was armed with letters from Gen.
Luis Ten-anas and others saying that
they had had no cattle killed in the
Juarez packing house." We saw the
secretary of agriculture and told oui
s ide of the story. The result was that
the government sent an inspector here
and I am told that this inspector sub
stnatiated what we had already said
about conditions. As a result the
Juarez packing plant was closed."
"Then Carothers wrote many let
ters to the I'nited States, saying that
the plant was being nm in a sanitary
condition. I don't think he convinced
Secretary Houston. But he did con-
ince Secretary Bryan, who saw that
his friend, Pancho Villa, needed the
money. The plant was reopened, but
pfter the recognition of Carranza it
was again ordered closed."
"The American cattlemen have had
a hard time in Mexico during the past
three .wars, he declared. "They haven't
been allowed to brand their own
calves. They have seen their own
cattle confiscated and rebranded. In
many instances they have been forced
to turn over their fat cattle without
tn'.y reimbursement. Some of these
cattle have been brought into the
United States, and others driven to
the river and there slaughtered and
the hides brought across. Since the
duty has been removed from cattle
Americans have spent enough money
for Mexican meats to build a tleet
c,f mattleships."

If reports from the Turkish head
quarters coming by way of Berlin are

verse in their endeavor to reach the
lesieged town of Kut-h-l-Amara, on
the Tigris river. Some 20 miles east

It was alter this fight, which lasted

YCMA, Ariz., Jan. 25. Residents of
Yuma were joyous tonight over the
announcement that the I'nited States
senate had passed a resolution to make
available $".0,000 for repair of the gov
ernment levee in the Gila river. It
was this break wh;cn caused the
flooding of Yuma Saturday.
Offers of financial assistance were
received today in telegrams from many
parts of the I'nited States, but offi
cials said that no outside aid was
necessary beyond the congressional ap
propriation, news of which was re
ceived late this afternoon in an As

Prank K. Ewing, former mayor, was
elected to the position made vacant by
the death last Saturday of Mayor

Most of the steel used in California

in many particulars the suggested
form of agreement designed to include

It was stated by excellent authority,

ANCIENT DISPUTE
IN LABOR ENDED

NEW YORK, Jan. 25. The dispute
of years standing between the United
Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners
and the International Bridge and
Structural iron Workers, as to which
organization should have jurisdiction
over dock workers' union, was decided
today in favor of the carpenters by a
committee appointed by Samuel

Ideas As to Raising

Republican A. P. Leased Wire
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 25.
Some idea of what American army
officers are learning on the battle
fields of Europe was given the sen
ate military committee today by Col
onel Charles G. Treat of the army
war college. Much of what the col
onel said was treated as confidential,
but it is known that he told the com
mittee there was an American ob
server with the armies of each bel
ligerent nation and that their reports
to the war college had been of great
value in the preparation of new
army plans.
As a matter of course. Colonel
Treat said none of the observers
would send home during the war in
formation which might be of value
to other belligerents should it be
come known in this country.
Both the congressional committees
were given much information today
as to artillery tips. Brigadier Gen
eral Crozier, chief of ordnance, dis
cussed in detail before the house
committee the war department's plans
for big guns, while Colonel Treat, a
field artilleryman, talked of the
lessons drawn from the war.
Colonel Treat disclosed that the
wifr department has definite informa
tion as to the famous 42-centimetre
howitzers which the Germans used
to crush their way through French
frontier forts. The guns can be
fired without mounting them on con
crete emplacements, he said, and
made ready for use in less than an
hour and a half after they reach a
given point. Both he and General
Crozier told of plans for similar guns

I Although the president previously
I has taken the position that the
powers of a tariff commission already
are held by existing government bu
reaus, he told Mr. Kitchin he felt
justified in pressing for the cre
ation of a separate commission at
this tme, because of unusual condi
tions existing in the world, and on
account of the interest the United
States will have in commercial ad
justments after the present upheaval.
Representative Kitchin said he per
sonally thought the federal trade
commission should be clothed with
whatever additional powers might be
necessary, but that he believed that
a majority of the ways and means
committee favored a new independent
body.
As proposed by the president, such
a commission would have specific
powers to:
Investigate the administrative and
fisca' effects of customs laws now iu
lorce or which may be passed in tha
f.iture:
Determine the relations between
rule." of duties on raw materials and
those on finished or partially fin
