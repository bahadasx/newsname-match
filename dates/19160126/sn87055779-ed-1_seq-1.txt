IS EXPLAINED
li STATEMENT
Attorney Contend4, Mrs. Möhr
Could Not Hav2 banned
the Murder of Her
Husband.
POLICE CAPTAIN IS
LAST WITNESS HEARD
Called on by State to Corrob
orate Evidence of the
Alleged Confessions
of the Negroes.
Internatioti.il News Service:
PROVIDENCE. R. 1.. Jan. 26.
Merely hammering home the testi
mony of two weeks that the ne
groes, Victor Brown, Henry Spell
mai and George Healis confessed
that Mrs. Elizabeth Frances Möhr
hired them to kill her husband, the
state today rested in the trial of the
woman and two of the negroes for
the murder of Dr. Charles Franklin
Möhr.
The prosecution called T," witness
es, the last being Capt. George
H. Monahan. who corroborated the
previous police evidence of the al
leged confessions of the negroes.
After the state closed there was a
consultation of counsel, after which
Justice SJearna inormd the jury that
Spellman and Drown waived thetr
privileges of opening statements. The
court said the defense of the ne
groes would come after Mrs. Möhr
has closed her case.
No Unwritten Iav.
"No so-called unwritten law will
be pleaded by Mrs. Mohr," was the
opening remark by Atty. Arthur
Cushing of the defense.
Mrs. Möhr cried softly through
out the lawyer's speech. She made
no sound, but her handkerchief was
all the time at her eyes.
"The unwritten law may go in the
south and west, but New England
and Rhode Island has no use for it,"
Cushing continued. "We care not
what Dr. Mohr was. He may have
been a good man. He may have
been a cruel and faithless husband
and father.
"His character does not enter into
this woman's defense. Dr. Möhr
was human and had a right to live.
His murder was perhaps one of the
worst crimes in recent times.
"The state has alleged that Mrs.
Mohr was actuated by jealousy and
cupidity.
Ab-urd Propo-Mion.
"That is an absurd proposition.
Those two emotions, jealousy and
cupidity cannot exist in the same
breast.
"Jealousy is caused by sex love.
Love is not calculating. Ejve never
committed a deliberately planned,
cold-blooded murder.
"On the other hand, cupidity can
not live with love. The love that in
spires jealousy has no thought for
acquiring property.
"We will show you that here is a
deserted, heart-broken wife, who for
months kept an almost insane watch
on her husband. Such a woman
could not have been thinking ef
material property: could not cool
ly plot a cold-blooded murder."

Leaders Attack Measure But
Conference Adopts Resolu

International New Se-rvi'-e:
LONDON, Jan. The eyes of
the neutral world and especially
thctse nations with big shipping in
terests, 'were turned upon parlia
ment today when b bate was open
ed in commons upon the question of
tightening the blockade of Germany.
There was a strong opinion in well
informed circles that the gievein
ment had derided to maintain its
blockade upon the present lines
without attempting to cut off the
shipment of contrabands to the
Scandinavian countries and Holland.
Strong influence was exerted upon
P.ritish and French governments by
the menacing stand taken by
Sweden. Open threats have been
made by Swedish statesmen that an
embargo on contraband merchan
dise consigneel to Swedish ports
might result in that country
to war against the allies.

BRISTON. England, Jan. 2C. Al
though the chief speakers at the
labor conference today attacked
conscription as undemocratic, never
theless the delegates this afternoon
adopted a resolution pledging tho
support of the labor party to tho
government in a successful prosecu
tion of the war.
The 600 delegates present repre
sent more than 2,000,000 working
men. The socialistic c ontingent was pre
pared to introduce strong resolutions
calling upon the government to
adopt measures which will prevent
England from going to war for
evermore.
The question of compulsory service
for workingmen in munitions fac
tories threatens to bring about a
J split in the labor party which may
take years to heal if it is ever healed
at all.
The struggle between the social
istic pacifists anel the pni-govern-ment
element promises to make this
the most important labor confer
ence in the history of England and
s-tormy sessions were predicted.
Some of the delegates favor the
adoption of a resolution for an in
ternational brotherhood f labor.
The ultimate aim of those sponsor
ing this resolution is to give the
working men such power in the first
class nations of the world as to pre
vent wars in the future.
The most important possibilities
are contained in the attitude which
the coal miners and railway work
ers will take. Leaders of both these
classes of workingmen have threat
ened national strikes that they have
a program which will do away with
wars and in this connection they
point out that the principals have
already been endorsed by the social
istic pacifists of France, Italy. Ger
many, Switzerland. Holland. Den
mark and Norway. Chief of the
principles feet forth in this program
are:
L Elimination of secret treaties.
2. Reduction of armaments.
:;. Establishment of an interna
tional tribunal 1 1 settle disputes be
tween nations.
4. Extension of the governmental
pejwers of parliaments.

WASHINGTON, Jan. 26. Ger
many must specially characterize the
sinking of the Lusitania as an il
legal act. Until she does so there
can be no final settlement of the
dispute growing out of the torpedo
ing of the big Cu narder.
That is the "last word" of Pres't
Wilson. It was personally conveyed
to Ambassador von Rernstorff today
by Sec'y of State Lansing. The lat
ter explained that the president
considet ed the general character of
the Lusitania proposals contained
in the latest "informal" communica
tion from the Perlin foreign otlice
satisfactory. Rut he positively de
clined to permit the passing over of
the ejues'tion of responsibility in the
manner that Rerlin has suggested.
("ifTininy has failed anywhere to
accept responsibility for violating
international law and while agree-!
ing to pay indemnity for the Amer
ican lives lost when the Lusitania
went to the bottom off the Irish
coast, indicated that it did so more
as an "act of grace" than'as ;t "jus
tifieej legal obligation."
Sec'y Lansing and Count van Rern
storff, at a conference at the state
department today, agreed on the
general form of settlement which
will he acceptable to the Fnited
States. This was a somewhat difh
ciilt tas because of the differences
between the German and English
language. The ambassador was anx
ious that terms be used which would
have thi same meaning in both Ian-!
guages and would not seem stnuiger
in the German than in the English
