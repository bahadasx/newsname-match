PEANUTS TO FRON1]?.
Experiment Proves Successful in
Florence County.
Florence, Jan. 21.?Th?> experi?
ment made by the peanut growers in
this county last .year was icenerally
successful. F. M. Rogers, who Intro?
duced the tobacco culture, will prob?
ably be known to this generation as
the leader in the peanut culture, just
as he Is to the last generation as the
tobacco pioneer. Mr. Rogers will in?
crease his acreage next year, to about
500 acres, he expects. He found a
ready market for all that he could of?
fer and the price was satisfactory. Mr.
Rogers says that It will not do to en?
courage every farmer to plant pea?
nuts for market, because all land is
not suited to their growth and all
farmers can not grow them success-?
fully and he does not wish to be
blamed for nor saddled with any of
his neighbors' or fellow citizens' fail?
ure to realize their expectations. This
section, however, seems to be particu?
larly well adapted to the culture of
the nuts and where land suits for
them and farmers are willing to try,
there is a pretty sure promise of suc?
cess.

sors to Examine All American Mail
for Purpose of Obtaining Informa?

tions show a three-fold purpose: One
to interfere with American commerce

ish trade with information useful in
competing with American trade;
third to obtain information of ship?
ments of American goods to Germany

EiABRlSOM PLAN APPROVED.
MILITARY EXPERTS INDORSE
CONTINENTAL ARMY.
Scott and Bliss Point to Value of
I Scheme and to Impracticability of
Other Plane Advocated.
Washington, Jan. 21.?Unqualified
I support was given Secretary Garrison's
I continental army before the senate
military committee by Maj. Gen. Scott
and Maj. Gen. Bliss, respectively chief
and assistant chief of staff of the
army. Both amplified statements
made on the same subject last week
before the house committee.
Gen. Scott delcared the plan would
I save at least five months' time in
building an army of defense in a war
emergency. He advocated immediate
organization of a reserve corps of offi?
cers actually commissioned and as?
signed to the posts they would take in
time of war.
Gen. Scott also urged that a quar?
termasters' reserve corps of enlisted
men be formed to include mechanics
of all kinds, telegraphers, radio op?
erators, drivers, railway men and the
like. A representative of the Amerl
ican Legion, he said, had told him re?
cently that 16,000 men of his sort had
been listed by the organization as will?
ing to enlist in such corps.
Both generals expressed the opin?
ion that universal military service was
|tho only "ideal democracy" method of
building an army, but army officers
I thought the country would not tol?
erate the proposition.
Discussing the details of the various
j bills under consideration, Gen. Bliss
said that proposed by the war depart?
ment was the only one which ap?
peared satisfactory or contemplated a
(definite policy. The" war college di?
vision of the general staff, he said,
has fixed 500,000 men, more or less
trained, as the irreducible minimum
necessary for the country's safety in
the first shock of war.
The proposal to increase the regu?
lar army to 250,000 as suggested in
Senator Chamberlain's tentative bill,
he added, was wholly inadequate by
Itself. Moreover, he added, it was
tmpc-ssible to recruit a lariger force
than 140,000 men,- as proposed' by
Secretary' Garrison for the regular
army, without Increasing pay or oth?
erwise giving added inducements.
He read a report from the adjutant
I general declaring that It would be im?
possible to recruit even 200,000 men
in peace times and that the average
maximum force that could be main?
tained was only 122,000. Recruits
now costs the government SI00 per
man, delivered to their regiments, the
reneral said. He disapproved short
enlistment terms to build up a regu?
lar service, saying this would make It
necessaiy to recruit 20,000 or more
men annually.
Discussing the continental army
plan, Gen. Bliss said it contemplated
246 batteries of artillery, which alone
j would be worth all that may be ex?
pended. The day had passed when
field guns are manoeuvred to any ex?
tent, he said, and no consideration
need be given to the question ot pro?
viding horses for -the guns.
Questioning both witnesses, Chair?
man Chamberlain brought out the
statement that the bill prepared by
Secretary Garrison had never been
submitted to the war college division
of the general staff. Gen. Scott point?
ed out, however, that the continen?
tal plan had been approved by the
i
war college In Its report to the secre?
tary.

Walter Hume Long, president of
the local government board, in n
speech closing the discussion, said he
desired to remove the impression that
under the bill the government was

of a military machine which would

Philip Snowden, the Socialist mem?
ber for Blackburn, speaking as an
{opponent of the bill, paid a warm
I tribute to the generous way the bill
had been piloted through the house
by Andrew Bonar Law and Mr. Long?
Mr. Bonar Law then expressed the
grateful thanks of himself and Mr.
Long to all sections for the restraint
shown in committee.
John Dillon, Nationalist, added that
he had never seen a bill which might
easily have led to passionate, heated
[debate, conducted through the house
with greater skill or in a more con?
ciliatory manner. He thought that
Premier Asqulth had never shown
