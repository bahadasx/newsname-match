EL PASO, Jan. 26?Francisco Villa,
now in western Chihuahua, defying
the forces of the Carranza government,
Is using the cry "Remember
Orozco" to stir up hatred against
Americans and gain recruits for himself,
according to foreigners who

General Orozco was Villa's most
formidable foe until the lattc rdrove
him across the border into the United
States after the battle of OJlnaga
nearly two years ago. Orozco was
shot and killed last September In the
mountains on this side of the boundary

being held as a violator of United
States neutrality laws. "Villa taking
advantage of the circumstances of
Orozco's death Is declared to be
using his name as a rallying cry for
recruits.
Western Chihuahua was the home
of Orozco as well as that of Villa,
and the dead leader had a largo following,
which is said to have been
Inflamed recently when Villa Informed

dered in Texas by Americans.

LONDON, Jan. 26.?The Japanese
government has delivered to the Chinese
minister in Tokio for transmission
to his government a note em*
bodying seven demands which were
included in the Japanese program
of last spring, the Manchester Guardian
learns from far eastern sources.
The Guardian expresses the hope
that this news will be "authoratively
contradicted," as the demands
when previously presented were full
j of danger to China's independence
and their general effect would have
been to place China under the tute
lage 01 japan. "ll la iue aim ituu
hope of British policy," the newspaper
continues, "to see China strong
and independent developing peacefully,
without interference from any
foreign power."

In West Virginia, Is now on In rull

. selection when he secured the services
of Dr. Morrison, the sllver!
tongued orator of the South, and n
, man whose lovable nature and sterling
character makes him Instantly
a great favorite with all who meet
him.
i The preaching of Dr. Morrison Is
, without a parallel In some respects?
In fact he stands alone. He Is a man
whose peculiar manner of getting
; right down to the very vitals of a
subject make him perhaps better fitted
under existing conditions hero
than any other evangelical workor
that might have been suggested. To
. miss one of his masterly sermons Is to
I' miss a treat.
Last night there was a great crowd

will doubtless be much greater.

Of Prime Importance to Great
Britain in the European
War Struggle.
The poaftlon of the British government
on two matters of prime importance
In the conduct of the war is to
be determined as a result of proceedings
underway today. The attitude
of labor toward compulsory military
service will be decided at the conference
meeting today In Bristol. The
debate on the question of a blockade
of German Is before the House of
Commons.
The Bristol conference Is the most
Important of Its kind ever held In
England representing more than 2,000,000
members of trades unions.

having passed the House of Commons
and encountered little opposition
In the House of Lords the out

great opposition to compulsion developed

died down to a considerable extent
since that time.
There are intimations unofficial In

has decided against n formal blockade
of Germany. It Is pointed out In English
