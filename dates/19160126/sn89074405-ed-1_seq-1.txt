IAB0R MEETING
IS WATCHED BY
ENGUSHPUBUC
Labor Conference in Bristol
is Regarded as Very
Significant.
CHANGED VIEWS
BELIEVED LIKELY
Understood, too, That Eng
land May Not Declare
a Blockade.
The position of the British govern
ment on two matters of prime import
ance in the conduct of war are to be
determined as the result of proceed
ings under way today.
The. attitude of labor toward com
pulsory military service will be decid
ed at the great conference meeting in
Bristol, and the debate on the ques
tion of the blockade of Germany is on
before the house of commons.
Hope for Change.
The Bristol conference Is the most
Important conference of this kind ever
held in England, representing more
than 2,000,000 members of trades
union*.
The compulsory military service
bill, having passed the house of com
m'ons, ana having encountered little
opposition in the house of lords and
the outcome of a long campaign on
this issue will depend largely on the
attitude of the organised labor con
ference. It is believed opposition to
compulsion, developed at the London
labor conference, has died down to a
considerable extent.
There are Intimations, unofficial in
nature, that the British government
fcas'Sebtded against the .formal block
ade of Germany.
It is pointed out in English newspa.-,
pers, which reflect the view of the
government, that such blockade might
weaken Great Britain's hands and in
crease friction with neutrals.
Austrian Drive.
The Austrian drive down the east
ern coast of Adriatic, having passed
beyond the Montenegrin border, is
now said to have resulted In the cap
ture of the Albanian seaport, San Gio
vanni Die Medua.
Rome advices indicate that the
Italian government is. concerned at the
extension of Austrian influence south
ward along the Adriatic, but there is
no indication that further measures to
oppose the Teutonic forces are under,
way.
It Is said no alarm is felt in Rome
for Avlona, which has been occupied
by Italian troops, or for Durazzo, in
the hands of Essad Pasha, provincial
president of Atbina, who has cast his
lot with the Entente Allies.
FUNDS II?SUFFICIENT.
Jefferson City, Mo., Jan. 26.—Gov
ernor Major of Missouri yesterday
sent notices to the heads of all the
state institutions that funds for vari
ous Institutions are barely sufficient
to provide for salaries and mainte
nance because the last legislature ov
er-appropriated estimated state reve
nues by 14,000,000. Governor Major
vetoed more than $2,000,000 and ob
tained promises from the heads of the
institutions to hold.-up par{ of the es
timated expenditures.
HND CAIRN OF
U. S. BPLORBIS
Canadian Police Back From
Long Trip, Seeking Es
kimo Murderers.
(Herald Special Service.)
Winnipeg, Man., Jan. 26.—Con
stables Hyatt, White and Chinn of the
mounted police arrived in Regina,
Sask., today from Hudson Bay, where
during the last year they have been
doing patrol duty.
With the arrival of these officers
comes the first story of the finding
of the Cairn of Radford and Street,
two Americans who were murdered
by Eskimos three years ago. These
officers were members of the mounted
police escort of the party of Inspec
tor Beyts, sent up north to Investigate
the murder.
The party traveled to Bakers Lake,
beyond Chesterfield Inlet, and located
Cairn of the Radford and Street
Names were found pinned out In the
wall of the Cairn, and some articles
belonging to the explorers were also
found. No news of the Eskimos'was
obtained.
The officers state that although sto
ries concerning the temper of the two
United States explorers had been cast
abroad, there appeared to be little
foundation for them, as the men were
known as two of the "white" men on
the bay, and were held in high es
teem by everyone.

of Optimism Before Im

Rich, agent of the Federal Reserve
bank of Minneapolis, struck the keys
of optimism in an address here yes
terday at the annual meeting of the

dict what the world-wide conditions
of the present may bring forth, but I
feel confident that the crisis, so far as
this country is concerned, haB passed
and that If we will exercise our sober
best Judgment and refuse to over
extend or to permit inflation, the
prosperity we are enjoying will con
tinue. If we take this as our plat
form, I am confident we shall see an
improvement In 1916 that will satisfy
our best expectations. Business is
moving forward again and reports
from all quarters are hopeful.'
Farmer Has Been Helped.
Then, asking and replying to the
Question, "what has the federal re
serve system done for the benefit of
the farmer, the man in commercial
business and the general average of
our people?" Mr. Rich proceeded to
brush away prejudices which have
obtained in this state to some extent
"So far as our reserve hank In this
district Is concerned." he said, "we
have accomplished the purposes that
were intended by law. We have been
an Institution of accommodation. We
have exercised a beneficial Influence
upon interest rates. We have created
a margin of credit for those in agri
culture and In business: that would
not have been available except tor the
reserve bank, and we have exercised,
through the bank, the steadying in
fluence that was expected of us.

London, Jan. 26.—The Japanese
government has delivered to the Chi

bodying seven demands which were
included in the Japanese program of
last spring, the Manchester Guardian
learns from far eastern sources.
The Guardian expresses the hope
that this news will be "authoritatively
contradicted," as the demands, when
previously presented, were full of dan
ger to China's Independence, and
their general effect would have been
to place China under the tutelage of
Japan.
"It is the aim and hope of British
policy," the newspaper continues, "to
see China strong and independent,
developing peacefully without inter
ference from any foreign power. It
is a duty we owe both to ourselves
and to China." says the Guardian
finally, "to help her in that direction,
and we have enormous material In

for us the only right and Just policy."
