Insuruuco fund of $18,000, fared to

England Not to Disturb Its

London, Jan. 26. Tho British gov

atandpat on Ha present trade regu
lations instead of announcing estab
lishment of an actual blockade
against Germany in parliament this
afternoon, according to the majority
of experts today.
Only a few newspapers clung to
the belief that the cabinet will change
tho policy radically. The government
may tighten the present regulations
In some ways, but It Is believed that
tho cabinet la against a revolutionary
change.
Protests of American and Sweden
against the reported plans have cool
ed tho advocates of an actual block

ently the warlike utterances of the
Swedish premier, while the Tele
graph and the News' cautioned the
government not to Involve neutral
nations in a controversy.
"Press firebrands," said the News
"have demanded that the govern
ment brush neutral nations from Its
path with a strong hand, but what
would be tho position of the allies If
the vast resources of the United
States ceased to be at their com
mandT"
"The country may be content with
the present measures, which, if slow,
are euro and have hitherto been
abundant, without severing friendly
relations with neutral nations. We
have had experience with the conse
quences of imperious and overbear

Introduction of a blockade resolu

Grey would deny that the present
"blockade" is Ineffective.

IN THE AIR
Wordy War to Continue Be
tween President Wilson
and Kaiser Wilhelm Before
Settlement of Differences
Washington, Jan. 26. The United
States and Germany will not come to
the parting of the ways in the fresh
differences over the Lusltanla esse,
German Ambassador von Bernstorff
clearly indicated today after meeting
with Secretary of State Lansing.
On the other hand, he declared,
the matter is practically settled. It
Is only a question of words, and it
ought all to foe settled within a few
days."
Immediately after their conference
neither the envoy nor the premier
would say whether they had pro
gressed toward an adjustment of the
radical differences between the Ger
man and American view points, made
known with President Wilson's re
fusal to accept the German proposals
submitted to him this week. Berns
torff, however, made bis "practically
settled" comment some time .after the
conference.
It was believed that Bernstorff,
In today's session, probably went far
toward assuring an unequivocal dis
avowal of the Lusltanla torpedoing,
but upon which the United States
firmly and unswervingly Insists. The
most he could do would be to Insist
that the Berlin foreign office make
the requisite disavowal, thus reced
ing from its position that the sinking
of the vessel was not Illegal. He an
nounced that he would communicate
today with Berlin, hence it was sup
posed he planned to urge a complete
concession to American demands.
That he expects Berlin to accede to
this request was further evidenced
by a somt-officlal German prediction
today that a satisfactory adjustment
of the whole matter will be reached
by the end of next week.
The communication to Berlin, it
was learned, was America's final pro
posal for settlement of the case. It
held as an unequivocal term that Ger
many must admit the illegality of the
torpedoing; and the state department
arranged that Bernstorff might cable
It at once to Berlin. In the mean
time nothing further will be done in
the case.
After the conference the envoy dic
tated a message to a state department
stenographer, which presumably was
the new terms to be transmitted in
departmental code to Berlin. The
session between the two men lasted
35 minutes.

DEMOCRATS WILL
TALK OF REVENUE
(By United Press Leased Wire.)
Washington, Jan. 26. A prelim
inary survey of revenue legislation
will be vniade in a meeting of the
house ways and means committee'
called by the democrats for next
week.
Leaders declared the conference
will consider revision of the income
tax, the inheritance tax and will dis
cuss the question of taxing munitions,
of creating a tariff commission in
keeping with President Wilson's
wishes and of continuing the present
duty on sugar.
Chairman Kitchin announced that
the house democrats will caucus on
all revenue matters before they are
reported to the house. ,
The proposed tax on munitions will
be in the form of an excise tax, if it
Is levied at all. In the matter of
the income tax, however, there Is a
strong opposition to lowering the tax
exemption, though the-committee is
said to be unanimous on the point of
Increasing the surtax on larger in
comes. No revenue legislation, except pos
sibly provision for a tariff commis
sion and levying of more protection
for the dyestuff industry is expected
for several months.

LABOR OPPOSED

(By United Press Leased Wire)
Bristol, England, Jan. 26. Oppo
sition to the government conscription
bill was reported today by delegates
at the opening of the national labor
conference here, but there was a dif
ference of opinion as to the method
of expressing this.
Bitter debate was anticipated over
the resolution of radical members for
proposing a general strike.
Wm. Crawford Anderson, a labor
member of parliament, declared that
attempts to make conscription a
"means of coercing the unionists
will result not only in ibltterness, but
failure."
"I fear," he said, "that England
Is attempting an impossible task. She
Is trying to become a great naval,
military and industrial power simul
taneously. This Is going to be a dif
ferent world after the war. It. will
be a hard, bad world for labor unless
labor participates in shaping affairs."
