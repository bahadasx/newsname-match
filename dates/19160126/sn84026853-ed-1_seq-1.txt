ELECTIONS MM
WIDEST INTERES"
MOST UNEXPECTED IS DEVEL
OPMENT OF OPPOSITION TO
ASSOCIATE JUSTICE FRASER
Columbia, January 22.?Special
The elections which will be held 01
Wednesday by the General Assembl;
arc holding the centrc of interest ii
legislative and political circles. An.
the most unexpected development ii
the whole group of places to be fille.
is the opposition to Associate Justice
T. B. Fraser. The name of George :
Mower, one of the Reprseentative
from Newberry and Speaker pro ten
of the House, has been brought for
ward in opposition to Justice Fraser
and this situation has caused a grea
deal of talk around the Capitol. J
former influential member of th<
General Assembly arrived suddeni;
in Columbia the other night to lool
into the matter, for he would hardl;
believe that opposition had develope-.
to the re-election of Associate Jus
tice T. B. Fraser, of Sumter.
This position is going to either in
crease in interest or opposition to th<
je-election of Justice Fraser wil
cease. The members have gone homi
for the week-end and nothing posi
tive will appear to get a line on th<
situation until they return on Mon
<lay night.
Warehouse Commissioner.
The warehouse commissioner's rac<
is still attracting much interest. Johr
L. McLaurin, who was last week en
dorsed by the State Farmers' Unior
and the South Carolina Warehous*
Association, is opposed by F. M. Carj
of Pickens, and John J. McMahan
of Columbia. The unofficial an
nouncement from the Governor's of
fice the other day that he had nc
candidate for this place was receivec
with a good deal of interest in bott
branches of the General Assembly.
Mrs. Virginia Green Moody, Stac<
librarian; Carlton W. Sawyer, Comp
troller General; and F. H. McMaster
insurance commissioner, will.be reflected
to succeed themselves without
opposition. This will also be the case
of Circuit Judges James W. DeVore
and S. W. G. Shipp, of the 11th and
12th circuits. The race for code commsisioner
lies between J. Rion McKissick,
of Greenville; J. C. Townsend,
of Columbia; F. F. Carroll, of Batesberg,
and H. J. Riley, of Bennetts ville.
Other positions to be filled at the
joint assembly on Wednesday are the
following:
Two trustees of Winthrop College,
B. R. Tillman and D. W. McLaurin,
terms expired.
Directors of State Penitentiary,
"terms of W. H. Glenn and A. H. Hawkins
expired.
Two trustees of the University oi
South Carolina, terms of W. M. Hamer
and C. E. Spencer expired.
Three trustees of Clemson_College,
terms of E. T. Hughes, R. H. Timmerman
and S. T. McKeown expired.
Two trustees of State Colored College,
terms of G. B. White expired,
and J. W. Floyd, deceased.
Two members board of visitors of
(the Citadel, terms of W. W. Lewis
pnd John P. Thomas expired.
Indications are that all of these will
V elected to succeed themsleves, th.=
Bly contest in sight being for direeB-s
of the State Penitentiary. All ol
me trustees will undoubtedly be chopn
for another term, the place of
Ken. Floyd on the State Colored College
being filled by C. F. Brooks, of
Laurens, who was appointed to the
vacancy by Governor Manning.

| JAMES F.
On last Thursday, 20th, inst. death
claimed James F. Bradley, County
Treasurer of Abbeville County. Mr.
Bradley was in his forty-fifth year
and until a week before his death
was one of the men who was never
thought of in connection with illI
health. He was robust, strong and
; his good nature made one think of
him as an example of a man who
enjoys all the blessings of good
! health. But he was attacked with
1 appendicitis on Thursday a week be,
fore he died. He suffered a recurrence
of the attack on the following
day and was hurried to Dr.
I Pryor's Hospital in Chester, where
> he was operated on Saturday. For
! a few days he got along nicely and
his friends began to look forward to
his home-coming in a few days.
; On Wednesday afternoon the news
' came that he was not doing well, and
that night the news was less favorable.
He contiuned to grow worse
j until Thursday afternoon, and passed
! away at 3:30. His mother and his
, brother, W. W. Bradley, were with
' him at the time of his death. His
wife, who was left ill at home, did
not reach his bedside until a few
minutes after the end came.
; James Foster Bradley was the second
son of John Edward Bradley
and. his wife, Sarah Wideman Bradley.
He was reared at the old Brad>
ley home in the Long Cane settlement.
In early life he joined old
Long Cane (A. R. P.) church, the
church of his fathers. He was edu
t cated in the country schools of that
i section and attended Erskine Col[
lege for a year. Deciding to enter
business he came to Abbeville and
clerked for Aug. W. Smith for a
; time. He then went to Willington
f and was in busienss a short while,
i but sold out his intersets there and
, became a traveling salesman until
. about six or eight years ago. He
) | was then elected as County Treasurer
j of this county, which office he has
L filled from that time most acceptably.
jH-e was a careful and painstaking
_ j officer, but at all times affable and
j attentive to those with whom he had
I business dealings.
L In early life he married Miss Lily
- Vincent. She with live children
. survive the husband and father. The
; children are Mrs. Henry Pressly, of
i Clinton, Miss Margaret Bradley,
James, Renwick, and Wrn. T Bradley.

IONGRESS TURNS 1
10 PREPAREDNESS
5 UPPERMOST IN THE MINDS 1
OF THE CONGRESSMEN
AT PRESENT.
Washington, Jan. 23.?President
ilson's determination to talk to the ^
lople of the Middle West on na- q
>nal preparedness has restored that j
sue as the uppermost subject of disssion
in congress. For several _
;eks preparedness has been over- ^
adowed by the Mexican situation %
d international questions resulting
om the Euronean wnr. WifVi +V>o
esident about to tour the country ?
arouse the public to the nation's tj
llitary requirements, administra- a
>n and opposition leaders realiie
at lively times are ahead on capi- fl
I hill. J
Democratic leaders in sympathy gj
th the president's preparedness t.
jws are gratified that the chief exutive
will take the field, inasmuch tj
there has been apparent in coness
a tendency to adopt a waiting
licy by many members uncertain
warding the views of their con- ?
tuents on the subject. The presi- y
nt's tour, it is believed, will serve
j double purpose of bringing out ^
blic opinion and stirring up the
fislators.
On the other hand, opponents of ,
gparedness see in the president's .
ps an opportunity to further their ?<
use by replying to his arguments p'
the senate and house.
Uneasiness over the Mexican sittion,
which stirred congress, has
jatly abated and probably will not ^
revived soon unless sensational de- w
opments occur in Mexico. Adminration
leaders regard the danger of
mg forced into dimcuities witn tne rranza
government averted for the
;sent and even Republicans of the
late have concluded not to force
i issue of intervention to a vote at
s time. Senator Borah, one of
i foremost believers in the necessi- ^
of military action in Mexico by the
lited States, has decided there is j
thing to be done at this time.
Democratic leaders in both houses ?
pect Mexican speeches to be made
w and then as a matter of course, fj
t they are satisfied that the situan
is in their control for the prest
at least. Some time during the o
ek Representative Humphrey of '
ishington, expects to make a jj]
;ech assailing the administration's
sxican policy. It also is probable v,
it President Wilson's reply to the '
late in which a mass of detail rerding
Carranza and Mexico will ba ^
:luded will serve to arouse inter;
of congress again. It is probas
that this reply will not be sent to
i senate until the president returns a
>m the West. 01
No Action Now. B
iterest still is apparent at the capi- si
in the European situation, but no a]
fislative action is expected. Em- V
rgo resolutions have been submit- R
1 to a subcommittee on foreign relons
and no report is anticipated tt
r some time. ?
With regard to legislation in genil
both houses continue to travel
wly, notwithstanding efforts of ad- L
nistration leaders to speed up the
;islative machinery. Committees
ve been urged to work faster and .
ns of progress are looked for durf
the week. In the house now that ti
ijority Leader Kitchin has returned
>m North Carolina, leaders will atnpt
to inaugurate the speeding up c]
jgramme and senate chieftains will si
all they can, although they must jf
pend upon progress first in the J*
use on appropriation bills and rev- u<
ue legislation. sc
The revenue bills must wait until
estimate of what money needed is 01
ailable, so the ways and means
nmitte hardly will accomplish
ich before the military and naval
nmittee reports come weeks hence L
The immigration bill with its liticy
test will be reported this week,
eling over this measure is high evin
the committee and its appear- r<
ce on the floor is expected to pre- t
litate heated argument. , j.
Peace advocates will be given a '
iring Tuesday by the foreign afrs
committee when resolutions je
king to formation of peace com- sj
ssions will be under consideration. cc
