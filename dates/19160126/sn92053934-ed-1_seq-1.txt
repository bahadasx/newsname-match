Washngton. Jan. 26. Great
Britain's preliminary reply to the
American representations against
seizures of mails reached the
state department today and with
the original American note, will
be made public in the newspap
ers Friday morning.
London, Jan. 25, (10:10 p. m.)
The foreign office handed to the Amer
ican embassy today an ad interim reply
to the American protest against de
tention of mails. The note states that
l formal answer to the representa
tives of the United States will be made
us soon as the French government has
signified its approval of the attitude
of Great Britain. It is understood the
formal reply will defend the action of
the British authorities by citing evi
dence that Germans have been abusing
the privileges of first class mails. The
British government will rely on the
postal conventions adopted at the
Hague for justification of its measures.
The United States protested to Great
Britain last month against interfer
ence with mails between this country
and Sweden. Large quantities of mail
matter, particularly parcel post pack
ages, have been taken from a number
of steamships which were detained in
British ports on voyages to the conti
nent. Publish Mail List.
The British foreign office today pub
lished a list of goods found in postal
mail bags of the central powers taken
from the Dutch steamships Frisia,
outward bound, Tubantia .inward i
bound and the Ryndam.
The mail bags taken from the Frisia
contained rolled gold chains, gold ear
rings, bracelets, rings and brooches,
and drugs, dyes, oleographs and ma
chine needles.
The Tubantia's mail bags are said
to have contained four sacks of rub
ber In packets marked "samples, with
out value" of a total weight of 73 Y2
pounds and addressed to Hamburg ;
from Brazil and also seven packets of
wool from Uruguay to Berlin of sam
ples size.
Heine Misused, Claim.
The examination of the Ryndam's
mail bags is alleged to have shown
that the mails contained 60 per cent
newspapers, 30 per cent propaganda,
and 10 per cent goods, "all of enemy
origin" and addressed in most cases
to Anns with German names in the
tnited States.
"The above particulars," it was said,
t the foreign office, "show the extent
to which the postal mails are being
Med by the enemy as a means of con
veyance of goods to evade the meas
ures of restriction of trade taken by
toe British government. By no pos
lible stretch can it be contended that
is the majority of the foregoing cases
articles seized are postal corres
pondence or samples, to which alor.e
& be applied such immunity as the
Postal mails enjoy."
The American note regarding Great
Britain's trading with the enemy act
s arrived here and will be delivered
to the British foreign offices today.

Washington, Jan. 26. The Lusita

Word of whether the German govern
ment will accept it in its present ten

If, as Is intimated today, the new
draft is fully acceptable to the United
States, there is reason for believing
it will be acceptable to Germany, be

VILLA IS DEFYING
CABRANZA ARMY
IN MEXICO HILLS
El Paso, Tex., Jan. 26. Francisco
Villa, now In 'western Chihuahua de
fying the forces of the Carranza gov
ernment, is using the i ry, "Remembei
Orozco" to stir up hatred against
Americans and gain recruits for him
self according to foreigners who
reached the border today.
General Orozco was Villa's most
formidable foe until the latter drove
him across the border into the United
States after the battle of Ojinaga, near
ly two years ago. Orozco was shot and
killed last September on this side of
the boundary after Le had forfeited
the bond under which he was being
held as a violator of United States
neutrality laws. Villa, taking advant
age of the circumstances of Orozco's
death, is declared to be usirg his name
as a rallying cry for new recruits.
The reports were brought to the bor
der by foreigners who were in Chi-
Ihuahua City during the period Just
before and after Villa evacuated the
capital.
Thirty-six Americans were thrown
into prison just before Villa left the
city, a number of Chinese were shot
and the stores belonging to them and
to Japanese were looted and burned,
it was reported. Villa made a point,
they said, of not threatening English
men and Germans.
The bandit chief announced that he
intended to hold the Americans until
they paid $30,000, but they were re
leased when Villa was told that re
leasing them was the only condition
under which he would be allowed to
enter the United States, if he were
forced to flee northward.

NEW DEMAND
ON CHINA IS
SENTBYJAPS
Seven of Concessions Asked
Last Spring Are Repeat
ed in Document.
LONDON HEARS REPORT
Hopes Expressed by English
Paper a Contradiction
Will Follow.
London, Jan. 26, (9:10 a. m.) The
Japanese government has delivered to
the Chinese minister at Tokio, for
transmission to his government a note
embodying seven demands which were
included in the Japanese program of
last spring, the Manchestei Guardian
learns from far eastern sources.
The Guardian expressed the hope
that this news will be "authoritatively
contradicted" as the demands when
previously presented were full of dan
ger to China's independence and their
general effect would have been to
place China under the tutelage of
Japan. "It is the aim and hope of Brit
ish policy," the newspaper continues,
"to see China strong and independence
developing peace fully without inter
ference from any foreign power.
"It is a duty we owe both to our
selves and to China," says the Guard
ian finally, "to help her in that direc
tion and we have enormous material
I interests, too, which reinforce what is
'for us the only right and just policy."
j Formerly Made 21 Demands.
I On Jan. 18, 1915, Japan presented
to China a list of 21 demands arranged
in five groups. The first grcup related
to the Shantung province and to the
conceding to Japan of rights and priv-
i ileges previously enjoyed by Germany
in Shantung as well as. new preroga
tives. Group two related to . South
Manchuria and to concesions there for
leasing of property, trading, railroad
operations and construction, the ap
pointment of Japanese as political,
financial and military advisers and
other concessions. This group also
included demands for special rights to
be granted to Japan regarding inner
Mongolia. Group three referred to the
Hanyeh-Ping company. Group four,
known as the 'special group," demand
ed that China proclaim that hereafter
she would not yield or tease any
coastal territory to any power. Group j
five, known as the "general group,"
was the one which aroused most vigor
ous protests from the Chinese govern
ment. It contained seven articles, the
first regarding the employment by
China of Japanese as advisers; the j
second, the construction of Japanese!
China; third, the employment of Jap
anese in the police departments in the
large centers; fourth, China to pur
chase a certain proportion of war mu
nitions from Japan; fifth, Japan's right
to construct certain railroads in China;
sixth, concessions to Japan in the
province of Fukien, and seventh, the
right of Japanese subjects to propa
gate Buddhism in China.

dressed a note to Japan with regard!
to the demands made on China, query-,
ing in particular with respect to three
points: The selection of foreign ad
visers by China, the purchase of war
munitions and the question of foreign
loans. The Japanese government re
plied to the note on March 22.

Wife'sDeath
Closes Long
Police Hunt
New York, Jan. 26. The death of
his wife was today learned to have led
directly to the arrest here of George
A. Gray on a warrant signed by the
governor of Massachusetts charging
him with larceny of cash and securi
ties valued at $100,000 from Fred
Kensel of Chicago and "other persons
living in Massachusetts." A detective
arrived here from Boston today to take
him back for trial.
Gray was arrested last night after
having been followed from an under
taking shop to the cemetery where
Mrs. Gray was buried earlier in the
day. He is said to have told the po
lice that the matter was a "family af
fair involving no larceny" and would
be quickly adjusted.
Police said Gray and his wife left
Boston last July and friends and
relatives did not again hear of them
until they learned of Mrs. Gray's
death.
According to the police, Gray, who
is 45 years old and was formerly a
lawyer in Boston, declined to tell
where he had been living since he left
Massachusetts.
WILSON FEELING
OUT SENTIMENT
ON NEW MEASURE
Washington, Jan. 26. President
Wilson summoned to the White house
today leaders of the senate and house
to learn their attitude toward a ship
ping bill, a tariff commission and the
Philippines bill. He Indicated to them
that in addition to the unpreparedness
program and revenue bills those three
measures would be the principal ones
backed by the administration.
As a result of the conference, de
tails of the shipping bill which, will b9
supported by the administration be
came known for the first time. It pro
vides that the government shall pur
chase or build ships and then lease or
sell them to corporations or private
individuals. Only in case no one of
fers to lease or buy the ships does
i the bill allow the government to oper-
'ate them.
The government could buy back the
ships at a reasonable price for naval
auxiliaries in time of war. A bond
issue of $50,000,000 for the purchase of
construction of ships would be pro
l vided by the bill, which also includes
a shipping board to control shipping
rates.
Senator Simmons, chairman of the
senate finance committee, who favors
both a tariff commission and the new
shipping bill, said the president was
anxious to get action on both meas
ures as soon as possible.
THE WAR TODAY
London morning papers empha
size the renewal of heavy fighting
on the western front and predict
that German activity in the west
will probably reach its height on
Thursday when the German em
peror celebrates his 57th birthday.
A Home dispatch says the Austri
ans have occupied San Giovanni
di Medua, a seaport in Albania.
The official statement from Pet
rograd says that Russian artillery
successfully bombarded German
positions in the region of the
Dvina, below Friedrichstadt.. In
Galicia on the Stripa front an ar
tillery duel has been in progress.
In the Caucasus in the vicinity of
Erzerum, the Russians claim to he
pressing the Turks closely and
that they have taken prisoners.
The London Daily .Mail corres
pondent who saw the German em
peror at Msh, Serbia, on Jan. IK,
says he is greatly aged and that at
a royal banquet there the emper
or spent more lime coughing than
eating.
A Vienna statement says the dis
arming of the .Montenegrins is pro
gressing without Interruption.
Berlin hears from Sofia that .Ma
cedonians are volunteering in
large numbers for service in the
Unitarian army.
The Austrian drive down the
eastern coast of the Adriatic hav
ing passed beyond the Montene
grin border, is now said to have
resulted in the capture of an Al
hanlau seaport, San Giovannia dc
Medua.
Rome advices Indicate that the
Italian government Is concerned at
the extension of Austrian influence
southward along the Adriatic, but
there are no indications that fur
ther measures to oppose the Teu
tonic forces are under way. It Is
said no alarm Is felt in Rome for
Avalona, which has been occupied
by Italian troops, or for IMirazzo
in the hands of Essad Pasha, pro.
visional president of Albania, who
has cast his lot with the entente
allies.
LABOR CLASS
IS FIGHTING
SERVICE BILL
Fate of Compulsory Issue of
Great Britain Hanging
in the Balance.
REPRESENT 2 MILLION
Delegates at Bristol Meeting
to Decide Attitude of
Organized Help.
Bristol, England, Jan. 26 (6:10
p. ni.) The British labor congress
adopted today, by a vote of 1,847,
000 against 206,000, a resolution
entirely approving the action of
the parliamentary labor party in
cooperating with other parties in
the national recruiting campaign.
Bristol, England, Jan. 26 (1:30 p.
m.) The representatives of more
than two million members of trades
unions met here today to decide the
attitude of organized labor toward the
war, and, in particular, compulsory
military service.
An attack on the compulsory ser
vice bill now before the house of lords
was made by the president of the con
ference, William Anderson, member
of parliament for Attercliffe division
of Sheffield. Mr. Anderson, who has
opposed the bill in parliament, declar
ed that it did not redeem the pledge
of Premier Asqultb. regarding com
pulsion. "No fornTdf words can offer immun
ity from danger," he said. "We cannot
have forced military service without
the risk of forced industrial service.
Any attempt to use this weapon to co
erce trades unionists will lead to great
bitterness and end in failure."
Mr. Anderson said there was dan
ger in Great Britain's "attempting the
impossible," by seeking to be simul
taneously a great naval, a great mili
tary and a great industrial power. He .
said the world would be different after
the war, adding:
"It will be a hard and a bad world
for labor unless labor takes a hand
in shaping it."
Pledge to Government
A resolution presented by James
Sexton, on behalf of the National
Union of Dock Workers, pledging the
conference to assist the government
as far as possible to prosecute the
war successfully, was adopted by a
vote of 1,502,000 against' 602,000.
Tension among the delegates was
evident from the moment W. H. Ayles,
a local labor leader, In welcoming the
congress, remarked that the members
of the party in Bristol neither had the
time nor the inclination to engage in
recruiting. Mingled applause and dis
sent greeted this remark.
The presidential address of Mr. An
derson did little to allay the suspi
cions of those delegates who haye
been making a fight against compul
sion. To Protest Conscription.
Suggestions of a compromise were
in the air during the noon recess. It
was hinted the delegates had virtu
ally agreed to support continued ten
ure of office of the three labor mem
bers of the government whose resig
nations were offered on account of the
military service . bill. According to
these reports this is to be offset by an
academic resolution protesting against
conscription.
The seriousness with which the del
egates regard the situation Is evident
from the anxious expressions on their
faces.
When the conference reassembled
President Gilmour of tfce Scottish
miners vigorously supported a dec
laration upholding the government's
prosecution of the war.
George Wardle, labor member of the
parliament, speaking for the railway
men's union, said the issue was clear
ly drawn between the great trades
unions and the independent labor par
ty, representing the socialist element.
He asked the conference to say which
had the right to speak on behalf of
labor.
