WHILE WALKING IN HILLS
NEAR THUMB BUTTE
DISCOVER BODY OF UN
KNOWN SUICIDE.
(From Tuesday's Daily.)
While walking- over the hills to
Thumb Butte Sunday afternoon. Mr.
and Mrs. V. Grant Deyarmin, mar -
. .. r t- r -.- , . 1
ncii ty juagc r. u. cmun last wceic.
discovered the skeleton of an un
known man. A coroner s jury yes
terday declared he met his death by
suicide.
Although a tliorougn search was
made by the authorities yesterday the
identity of tOie suicide could not be
learned. All the dead man left for
the benefit of his finders was the fol
lowing note written cn the first page
of an otherwise empty notebook
"Don't find, no folks, no friends,
broke, down and out."
The flesh of the body was decayed
and nothing remained but the skele
ton within the clothes. On top of the
body was found the notebook and a
Stetson hat which was bought at the
B.-B. Alongside the skull was found
a Los Angeles Examiner dated Feb
ruary 23. 1915, fixing the date of the
death within the last 11 months On
the hat band was found the following,
presumably the name of the suicide;
"B. Matt."
A 38-calibrc Harrington-Richards
nickel-plated revolver wes fcand in
the fingers of the suicide's right hand
Two cartridges had been fired and the
other three chambers contained load
ed shells.
Mr. and Mrs. Deyarmin had started
from Prescott along the railroad
tracks for Thumb Butte and as they
neared the spot they cut across the
iiills to get to it. As they reached tlic
top of a rocky rjdgc rhey stopped to
view the scenery and as Deyarmin
looked down through a small space
between two rocks he saw the feet of
the dead man. He called his wife's
attention and when they investigated
they found the body. Yesterday
morning he informed Justice of the
Peace McLanc of his find and a cor
oner's inquest was held.
The body was .hid away in what
might be called a small apcraturc
eight by tliree feet in the rocks, with
an entrance just big enough for a man
to get through. The suicide lay
lengthwise in the small rock-walled
inclosurc Through the skull a hole
was found, small at the right side
showing where the bullet had enter
ed, and shattered and large on the
left side telling where the lead 'iad
left the skull. The small pellet of
lead was found imbedded in the rock
to the left of tnc body. The ridge on
which the body was found is just be
lew Thumb Butte and about four or
five miles from Prescott.
The age of the suicide is estimated
at 55 years. Anion his effects were
found a sliotgun shell match case. x
purse containing 45 cents and an old
gold watch. He wore a pair of over
alls, a shirt, two suits of under cloth
ing and a big mackinaw.

CONVENTION
DECLARES WIFE
'GOT DIVORCE
BY
ROBERT TURNBULL ASKS
THAT JUDGMENT BE VA
CATED AND THAT NEW
TRIAL BE GIVEN.
(From Tuesday's Daily.)
Asking that the decree of divorce
granted Mrs. Jessie Tumbull on No
vember 6. 1915, be vacated and that a
new trial be granted. Robert Turn
hull of Los Angeles, in the motion
filed by his attorney yesterday, alleges
that she obtained it through fraud.
The husband asserts that Mrs.
Tumbull obtained her divorce by
fraud because they had been living to
gether 'at tfhc Royal Itotcl in Los An
geles up to September 25th, after sha
had filed her suit in the local Sti 9
pcrior court. Not over two months
later he states his wife was granted
her decree.
After he received the summons in
Los Angeles telling him of the suit
for divorce brought against him,
Turnbull states that his wife informed
ihim that she did not intend to go any
furthcr with the matter. She further
lulled him into that belief, he claims,
by writing letters to him. Before that
time the defendant claims she had
different places.
Turnbull claims that he has con
tributed to his wife's support and 'ias
sent seven money orders to her since
last July. The last money order was
sent about ten days before Mrs. Turn
bull obtained lier divorce, according
to tfhc defendant. On November 6th
the wife got "her decree and on Octo
ber 6th. 15th and 23rd, Turnbull al
leges that he sent her money.
"I love you more than any person
in the world." was the wording of u
telegram, Turnbull says, he sent to
his wife while she was in Phoenix
about two months before she sued for
a divorce. This part of the telegram
was placed in the motion tc prove
that Turnbull was not cruel to "his
wife, as she alleged in her complaint.
The wife was given the custody of
the child and Turnbull claims that
she 2? not fit to care for it. The
couple was married in r lioenix dur
ing April. 1908. Mrs. Turnbull ob
tained 'ier divorce on grounds of non
support. The motion will be heard
Monday, February 7th.
Alleged Marriage Annulled.
The alleged marriage of D. H.
Moore to Louvina Hanson, now Lou

of the alleged marriage, declared that
without knowing that Miss Bosley

had tried to marry her in Placer
county. California, on May 15. 1905.
