ing that the general sentiment seems
to be that all suggestive ami Indecent
dances be prohibited but that many
o the other provisions or the ortli
naneM are too drastic, unjust or un
necessary. In the opinion of several members
ol Ihe council no new ordinance Is
necessary to prohibit Immoral danc.

full power to act However. It seems
pmpaMe these coundimen will feel
disposed to recommend for passage
an ordinance directed against the
chief evils of the present-dny dance
The ordinance hus produced no end
of discussion during the past week
Objection has been made to tho
clnuse providing for all dances to
close at II o'clock or before, other
objection Is being made to the pro
vision requiring a re-admission
charge In case a dnncer leaves th''
hall and Ml 11 1 another Is directed
against the regulation of private par

'Although 1 have made a draft of.
the ordinance to lie presented to tho
city council tonight, giving the neces-j
sary power to city official to enforce
the prohibition law, there are some
chance which probably will have to!

that the ordinance follows strictly
the state law, defining what consti
tutes prima facie evidence and pro-i
vlding for issuing search warrants in j
cases where it ia believed the law is
being violated."
The foregoing is in substance a
statement made b City Attorney Feei
this numiing regarding the city ordl-j
nance to regulate liquor matters in
PandUHon. It will oo presented this ,
evening at the regular meeting of the'
city council if the anticipated changes
are Tiiade in time lor the final draft
Attorney fee has been working on j
the matter for the lust week but be-l
llevee there are some few details
whic h will have to be changed before j
the ordinance can be considered. It

commit'! w hich is expected to report j
late this afternoon so as to give the j
attorney time to make the alterations.'
The ordinance, according to Attorney;
Fee, w 111 not be out or the ordinary
In any respect but will follow closely
the provisions of the state law. It
simply aims to give the city police I
and other officials the power to han

turned over to state officers for pros
ecution. Men Arrested Here
Connected up With

James Morgan. Oeorge Howard and
Harry Raymond Carrier, the three
men arrested last Friday night by the
police as suspected eggmen. have
been connected up with the robbsrj i
of a drug store In Lapwai. Idaho earl
In January and will probably be re
lumed there for prosecution From i
the .Apwai store seventeen watches I
were stolen and two of the Watches j
carried by the trio have been identi
fied by Ihe make and numliers as a
part of ihe stolen property.
The three men refused to admit i
their guilt, farrier, the youngest of
the trio, has told several conflicting!
stories as to how he secured tha
watch he was wearing, first stating
bis mother gave it to him. then that
i ne of his pals gave it to him and
finally that he purchased it from a
stranger. The older men refuse tu
talk much.
Though the officers have not yet
identified the rest of their plunder
they feel sure that further investiga
tion will brink the ownership to light.
They believe the three men compose
one i if ihe worst gangs operating In
the northwest.
