LONDON, Eng., Jan. 20.
Great Jiritain stands firmly by her
recent seizure and detention of U.
'S.. mails,', the action having been
taken on the ground that sympa
thizers of Germany were sending
contraband through the mails.
The foreign office today handed
the American embassy an "ad in
terim" reply to the American pro
test against detention of first-class
matter. The formal answer will
be made soon.
France, it is announced, signi
fies her approval of the British
attitude. It is understood that the
formal reply will defend the ac
tion of Great Britain and cite evi
dence, that Germany has been
abusing the privileges of first-class
: mail.
HAGUE CONVENTION
COVERS MOST POINTS
WASHINGTON, D. C In all prob
ability Great Britain will have to es
tablish a precedent for Interference
with the malls of neutral countries by
a belligerent In time of war. Govern
ment officials here have failed to find
one which would serve as a guide In
the controversy between Washington
and London over mail seizures.
As far as parcel post mail is con
cerned, no difference has yet arisen
v between the two governments. , The
United States has not' claimed that
. parcel mail la protected by The Hague
, Conveiit'oh 'ot October 18f 1907, or by.
the universal postal convention. On
the contrary parcel mail Is covered
by; separate conventions with each
foreign tountry. Furthermore, parcel
mall Is freight to all intents and pur
poses and In time of war has no inherent-
right not enjoyed by other
classes of freight
Contraband Under Seal.
While all governments regard the
seals on mall bags as inviolate, and
the breaklngof them is looked upon
as a most delicate matter, it can be
said with authority that the United
States will not stand back of its own
citizens or non-citizen aliens in this
country who may seek to protect con
trahand in the malls by sending it
first class under seal.
Under the nniversal postal conven
tlons and International usage patrons
of the mails have no right to send
merchandise in first class mail under
seal. The conventions limit merchan
diae so mailed to samples. Anything
beyond a sample must be sent by par
cel post and the first class malls do
not prdtect it
There is a question whether nego-
, tiable securities -do not properly be
long under the head of contraband,
since they can be converted into mom
ey, wnicn is generally regaraea
contraband. Therefore, should Great
Britain or any other belligerent seize
securities of or suspected of enemy
origin or destination they probably
would be within their rights. .
So far as Washington knows offi-
clally. Great Britain has not yet gone
beyond seizing -parcel man, despite
contrary reports, and her right to do
so is conceded. It is known to offi
cials that the British authorities con
-Emulate going much further. If the
seizure' of first class mail is limited
to packages sent in that way to evade
capture of articles of contraband des
tined for enemy countries the United
States will have little ground to com
plain. . .;. " ';;: )-':. ,
Even first class mail. Including
postal correspondence," is subject to
seizure if it is made during the block
ade of 'a port This also is conceded
by American officials. It is specifi
cally covered by The Hague Conven
tion of 1807.

Since Xmas Precipitation Has
'Exceeded By 4.03 inches An
nual Average for i 1 Years
Several kinds of freax weather vis
ited Honolulu last night and today,
ranging from k drizzle to a downpour
and from a light wind to a gust that
blew 54 miles an hour at 9:54 this
morning for 20 minutes. At noon the
wind velocity was only eight miles an
hour. -
At noon the storm had brought the
precipitation for January to 18.03
Inches, so that the rainfall for the
month now exceeds that of any other
month in the history of the local
weather bureau. .
This morning's rainfall, from 8
o'clock to noon., was .68 of an inch.
Last night, between 11 and 12 o'clock.
1.22 inches fell in 35 minutes. No
vember 12, 1.25 Inches fell in 30 min
utes.
"Last night's and today's rains.
bringing the total for January to date.
to 1 8.03 inches, mean that Honolulu
has had. from Christmas down to noon
today, rainfall totaling 26.62 inches "
the local weather bureau stated at
noon. in otner words, since cnrist-
mas we have : had more ram than
usually falls in an entire year."
The average yearly precipitation
for the last 11 years, since 1905 when
the local weather bureau ; was estab
lished, has only been 23.80 inches.
Not Real Kona Gale.
The local forecaster said today that
this is not a genuine kona gale, al
though the wind is from the south.
The barometer has not fallen as much
as in the last kona. This morning at
8 o'clock it stood at 29.87. Yesterday
at the same time it was 29.92. and
Monday it was 29.95, wnlle Sunday'it
stood at an even 30.
Because of the barometer's compar
atively small decline, steady high
winds are not looked for, although
heavy rains may continue to fall with
the barometer up. In last week's
kona the barometer descended to a
minimum of 29.66 to January 17.,
Rainfall last night, from 8 p. m. to
8 a. m. today, was 1.78 inches. The
present total for January. 1S.03, ex
ceeds by 4.03 Inches the highest pre
vious record, that of February, 1893.1
when Dr. Robert McKibbin recorded
14 inches for the month. The great-'
est precipitation 'for one month since
the local weather bureau was estab-
ished, was 12.44. in January. 1907.
The average January rainfall for 11
years has been only 3.81 inches.
Concrete Forms Torn Out.

; LOXDOX, Eng., .Jan. 20. That .Japan has jrsontMl to China
a new list of seven ilemumls which inn)eril the sovereignty of the
Chinese nation and menace the interest of foreigners 1 here is infor
mation which . the Manehester Cluarilian, partieularly well-informetl
on Oriental affairs, prints as eoniing from Far Kastern sonrees.
It is said that Japan has handed the Chinese minister at Tokio.
for transmission to Chhui a note embodying seven demands which
were inclnded in the Japanese program hist spring.
The (iiiardian expresses the hope that the. news will be "authori
tatively contradicted," as the previous demands, it declares, pn'sent
ed full danger to ChTna's independence. 44 It is the hope of British
policy," says the (juardian, "to see China strong and independent.
Our duty is to help in that direction." ' .. .
It is possible that the seven demands alluded today were tha
original seven of " (Jroup Five" of the series presented last spring.
. WASIIINGTOX, D C, Jan. 2C Many diilomats here, wheir
informed that Japan has apparently renewed the demands made
but not accepted last spring, express the' velief that the only power
in a position to make effective protest against the renewal of the
Japanese demands is the United States. The United States lias
never, taken an open position against Japanon this, matter but is
understood to regard all the articles of Group Five as objecttionable.
DEMANDS ROUSED MUCH PROTEST IN 1915 -
Much protest was roused in. the United States and Great Britain
last year by Group Five, of the Japanese demands. - The story will
be recalled that Japan first denied the existence of a number of the
demands complained of by China and later -explained that theje de
mand had nothing to 'r"Clo wUh international relaliio'hs aird hence lis
mention had been made of them to the Powers .
' : China rejected the seven demands of Group Five on the ground
that they virtually surrendered Chinese sovereignty. Others of the
demands were acceded to, and it was understood that Japan con
tinued to press steadily though quietly for acceptance of all.
Group Five in its original form is as follows, and it is believed
that this is about the form in which the whole group was rejected:
"Article 1. The Chinese Central government shall employ in
fluential Japanese as advisers in political, financial 'and military af
"Article 2. Japanese hospitals, churches and schools m the
interior of China shall be granted the right of owning land.
" Article 3. -Inasmuch as the Japanese government and the Chi
nese government have had many cases of dispute between Japanese
and Chinese police to settle, cases which caused no little misunder
standing, it is for this reason necessary that the police departments
of important places (in China) shall be jointly administered by
Japanese and Chinese, or that the police departments of these places
shall employ numerous Japanese, so that they may at the same time
help to plan for the improvement of the Chinese police service. "
"Article 4. Chinese shall purchase from Japan a fixed amount
of munitions of war (say 50 per cent or more of what is needed by
the Chinese government) or that there shall be established in China
a Sino-Japanese jointly worked arsenal. Japanese technical experts
are to be employed and Japanese material to be purchased.
"Article 5. China agrees, to grant to Japan the right of con
structing a railway connecting "Wuchang with Kiukiang and Nan
change and Chao-chou. ; ' C
"Article 6. If China needs foreign capital to work mines, build
railways and construct harbor-works (including dockyard) in the
province of Fukien, Japan, shall first be consulted. ( .
"Article 7. China agrees that Japanese subjects shall have the
right to propagate Buddhism in China."
