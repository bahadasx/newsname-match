VEARS OF ILLNESS.
CAME TO MANCHESTER IN YEAR 1858

As briefly stated in The Democrat
last week Mrs. Blair passed away
Wednesday afternoon, following an
illness which extended over four
years. During the years of her sick
ness Mrs, Blair was tenderly cared
for by her devoted husband, and
children, who spared no efforts to
minister to her comfort during the
long period of sickness. During much
of the time Mrs. Blair suffered in
tensely, and when the final summons
did come it came as a merciful re
lease from hopeless suffering.
Laura Bloomer was bora in Huron
county, Ohio, August 20, 1836, and
spent all of her girlhood days in that
section of her n.ative state. She was
united In marriage with Mr. Blair
at Lexington, Ohio, on May 5th, 1856..
After their marriage Mr. and Mrs.

consin, where the former established
himslef as an attorney. They resid
ed at Prairie du Chien for nearly two
years. In October 1858 Mr. and

place has been their home since.
Mrs. Blair is survived by her hus
band, one daughter, Mrs. Geo. W.
Dunham two sons, Charles L. Blair,
of New York City, and Fred B. Blair,
of this city. She is also survived by
two brothers and three sisters living
in Grand Rapids, Michigan, and one
sister residing in the state of Ohio.
For many years Mrs. Blair took a
keen interest in the work of the
Congregational church,.of which she
wga^aiQ^bev,'. and te- Wfe:
of this -etty. Mrs. Blair possessed
those qualities of mind and heart
which have left th,eir. impress upon
all those who knew her. During four
long years she bore her sufferings
with Christian fortitude.
A life permeated with kind
ness and love has been closed by the
merciful hand of death, to blossom in
richer fullness and beauty in that
life beyond the grave. The memory
of a life well spent will linger long
in the hearts of those who were at
tached to Mrs. Blair by the ties of
natural affection.
The Bar Association of Delaware
County, of which Judge Blair is *n county, became the
president, adopted the following reso
lutions, as a tribute to the memory
of his beloved wife:
Whereas, Laura Blair, wife of the
Honored President of our Bar Asso
ciation, mother of one member and
of the wife of another member of
our fraternal brothers, has left earth
ly scenes for the spirit life,
Whereas, in the comradeship of
the members of our Association we
would each lighten the sorrows of
our brothers in the mutuality of
our sympathies, therefore, be it
/Resolved, That to our bereaved
members we express, on this occa
sion, our high appreciation of the con
spicuous virtues and nobility of life
of this wife and mother, the mem
ory of which may be treasured as a
sacred and glorious heritage to her
family circle.
Resolved, That her Christian faith
and patience, which sustained her
so remarkably through grievous af
flictions, is worthy of special men
tion and commendation.
Resolved, That these resolutions be
spread upon the records of our as
sociation, that a copy thereof, duly
attested by the Secretary, be given
each of our bereaved members, and
that all members of our Association
attend the funeral services in a body.
