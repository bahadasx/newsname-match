figures" publishing world at
the present ,- . died suddenly on
Tuesday mornii-K of heart disease In
the automobile of his secretary, Otis
Davy, shortly after he had left his
home in EaBt Orange. N. J., to go to
his business in New York. His death
was most unexpected as he had been
apparently in perfect health until a
few minutes 'before.
Mr. Hill, who was in his 58th year.
was born in Sandgate, but with his
parents moved while still a small boy
to Central Wisconsin, where he was
educated in the public schools. At
the ago -fourteen years he went to
work in a country printing office, a
few years later he became half owner
of a small machine shop, and In 1878
he moved to Colorado and ran a loco
motive on the Denver and Rio Grande
railroad. He was promoted soon to
roundhoUso foreman and later assist
ant superintendent of motive power.
He always retained his card as a
member of the Brotherhood of loco
motive Engineci'3.
Mr. Hill made his first venture Into
the newspaper business in 1883,
founding the Daily Tress of Pueblo,
Col., and editing it himseir. At this
time he began to write contributions
to Ixtcomotive Engineering, ti tech
nical magazine of New York. In 1888
he went to New York and took charge
of LoconioU.vo Engineering. A short
time later he went into partnership
with Angus Sinclair, and they pur
chased the journal from its original
owners.
it was la 18'Jfi that Mr. Hill began
the string or technical trade jour
nals which he was conducting at, the
time of his death. He sold his in
terest in Locomotive Engineering to
his partner and "purchased the Ameii-
-can Machinist Around this nucleus
ho added in succession Power, and
the Engineering and Mining Journal.
In l&ll he established Coal Ago and
a year later he purchased .the Engin
eering News from George H. Frost.
To carry on the publication of tl'eso
periodicals hp founded the Hill Pub
lishing company, a majority of iho
stock of which he held, and then l''.:ilt
the Hill building, at Thirty-slxt'i
street, and. Tenth avenue, which was
completed little more than a year ago.
The firm had branches in England
and Germany.
Mr. Hill in 1882 married Miss Em
ma B. Carlisle, who with one daugh

Engineers, wlitise representative
he was on the Naval Advisory Board;
the Engineers' Club, the Railroad
Club, th Campfire Club, the Machin
ery Club, of which he was vice presi
dent; the Essex County Country
Club and Hope lodge, F. and A. M.,

Mr. Hill was the author of several
books, the best known of which are
"Stories of the Railroads," and "Jim
Skeever's Object Lessons," both of
which were written in the vernacu

LEAF SPOT OF CUCUMEERS.
A Disease Quite Prevalent In Eastern
and Middle States.
The angular leaf spot of cucumbers
is a di:ic;!o quite prevalent throughout
the eastern itnd middle western states.
It wii reporter as having been pres
ent the past year In Michigan, Indiana.
: Wisconsin ai rid New' York, as well as
the provinces of Ontario and Quebec,
in Canada. The disease has also lieett
reported recently from' Maryland ami
other southern states, i
The presence of the disease is indi
cated by angular, dry, brown spots on
the foliage, which by dropping out or
tearing give .the leaves a ragged ap
pearance. AH hough the disease has
been known for many years in the
field and has been conceded to be of
bacterial origin, heretofore no organ
ism has been named its its cause. As
a result of experiments recently con
ducted by the plant pathologists of tlu
federal dcparl ment. however, the genu
(.iiisini the di.se:ie litis been isolated
and Identified.
It. was found that the disease is caus
ed by a bacterial organism entering the
iraf through ir.itittte orifices in the otil
cr !:ycr. wounds not being necessary
to permit infect ion. Young stems may
l...0no soft rotted or crack open, but
no 'direct connection has been found
between the leaf spot and (he soft rots
of the frr.it. X heavy infestation, how
ever, often material: reduces the crop

This Department Edited by Secretary
Willard W. Bartlett of the County
Improvement Association
It might be well at this time to have
a clearer explanation of state law in
regard to road construction and main
tenance. ,
, State Roads ,
In each town certain roads deemed
of greatest importance have "been des
ignated as selected or state roads, tho
selection having been made by the
selectmen and approved by the State
lyghway Commissioner.
Tho selection was based on consid
erations of both local traffic, such as
roads to railroad stations and other
important centers, and through traf
fic to serve adjoining towns and pro
vide routes traversing the principal
valleys and leading 'through the im
portant mountain -.asses, thus making
the large towns and cities, the moun
tains and lakes aa accessible to all
as possible.
In Bennington County there are
777 miles of public highways of which
207 miles, or nearly 27 percent., are
selected or state roads. On these state
roads all state aid money must be
rpent.
There are live road" funds: (i)
The regular town maintenance money
it being required by law that each
town shall raise at leasj. a 20 per
cent, tax on the grand list for road
maintenance. Tills money is in the
hands of the town road commissioner
and is expended by him as he sees
fit to use it. It Is not used for snow
removal, or the cutting of bushes, the
selectmen being required to furnish
money for these purposes from the
general fund. ' ,
. (2L The 5 percent, fund. A gener
al tn of 5 per cent, is assessed by
the-'State on all towns. The money
ii paid in to the State Treasurer and
Is reopportioned by him to the towns
on the basis of road mileage. By
thin means the larger places contrl
l)t:te to i lie smaller places on the gen
c:t.1 principle that tho strong should
help the weak. This money collected
c;v valuation and distributed on mil
eage gives back to the' wealthier
towns a. smaller amount than they
contribute and gives the poorer towns
ti greater amount. This money must
be used for the construction of "per
manent" roads.
(3) Special appropriation. At the
March meeting or at a special meeting
duly warned, any town has the privi
lege, of voting not less than Jflui) nor
moro than $1,000 for road construc
tion In their town. ThiB sum of mon
ey so voted is matched by an equal
sum from the State treasury. There
3s available an annual sum of $1200,000
for this purpose.
Any portion of this sum that is not
matched by the towns is considered
as surplus and may be spent by tho
State Highway Commissioner in sucli
towns and oq such roads as he deems
of special importance to the state
and under the best torui3 that he can
make with the various towns. For
instance, if the citizens will raise
a certain amount of money for a cer
tain state road the chances are that
the State will mutch tho money by
nn amount from the surplus fund. If
the towns were to vote tho entire
thousand dollars in each case there
would .bo no surplus, in fact, not
enough to go around as there are 246
towns in the State.
Under the present law every town
in Bennington County can vote $1,000
and have it matched by the State
which would give the County $;!4.000
for permanent road work, without the
5 per cent. fund.
(4) The automobile fund. The
money from automobile registrations
hud operators' licenses Is available for
road maintenance through the admin
istration of Hie State Highway Com
missioner. The towns are charged
with the maintenance of both town
and state roads 'and are responsible
for any damage on any of the roau3
within their jurisdiction. Under pres
ent regulations the State Highway
Commissioner may annually allott to
a town a certain sum of money per
mile on its State highways (usually
about $10 per mile) provided they
hlive spent at least twice that amount
of money on state roads. The state
co-operates with the towns in resur
facing worn down state roads and
maintaining roads under tho patrol
system and with the villages in ap
plying oil or other dust-layers, pay
ing from this fund.
(5) The biidge fund. The last
legislature made hn appropriation of
$15,000 annually to be used ,hy the
state Highway Commissioner In fur
nishing the services of an engineer to
advise towns in planning the building
and repairing of bridges and super
vising their constructon and to pay
a part of the cost of building or re
building bridges of spans between' 4
and 30 feet. J' The Slate will not pay
more than ono fourth the cost nor
an amount exceeding $300 on any one
bridge. , .,
Administration of Funds
The laws i are intended to secure
tho largest possible measure of co
operation between the towns and the
State Highway Department. In main
tenance work tho Stat advises the
towns as to best methods of doing the
work and may supplement the
amounts raised by the town through
the administration of the automobile
fund, supervising the expenditure of
the funds toward which it contri
ibutes. A town to receive ita share
of the money on a mileage basis, must
maintain its roads satisfactorily to
the State. There is no law compel
ling the State Commissioner to pay
ono penny of maintenance money to
any town unless the roads have been
kept up to a satisfactory standard.
There are three other ways in
which the State aids in maintenance
as follows: .
Resurfacing
Under the present regulations of
the State Commissioner tho State will
match any town in the expense of
necessary resurfacing on State roads
up to a total expenditure of $1,000
in one year. Several towns in Beu
nfngton Coutitv takeratilage of this
aid.1 All of lfMMUd, as there
is not a ftnvn ir5ic bounty in which
resurfacing is hot needed on some
parts of tho State roads. In several
t-)wns au expenditure of $2,000 or
more Is needed for this purpose. To
have the advantage or State aid the
arrangements for the work must be
mado in advance and the work be
done under the supervision or the
State.
Patrol System
A town wlbhitig to put In operation
the patrol system of maintenance
makes application to the? State Com
mlssicner through its selectmen and
road commissioner, requesting the
State to take over for' the season the
maintenance of a cerla'n road, usually
C to 10 miles Jit length, and offering
to turn over to- the Stale a certain
stun from its road funds toward, the
cost. The leapt sum which the Statu
will usually 'accept is ihe average
amount per mile, which . tile town
raises by its road tax. For'example,
if It Is propored to establish a patrol
road 8 miles is Jpngth end the town
tax raises f.l'f.', per mile for all its
roads, the state will ' require a pay
ment of at least $2o0 by the town.
If tho offer is accepted, he State Com
missioner appoints a patrol man who
gives his entire time, or as much of
it as may be needed to the work,
the State maintaining the road for
the season and putting in as much
money as may be needed beyond tho
amount supplied by the town. For
the reason of 1915 three towns In
Bennington County took advantage o
this aid: Pownal, Shaftsbury, and
Woodford. The results have been
satisfactory.
At no time have the roads been al
lowed to suffer neglect, the constant
work of the patrolman has resulted
in a noticeable .building up and
smoothing of tho troad surface, the.
improvement of drainage and tho wid
ening of many narrow places. In ev
ery case the Stale has put. in a larger
amount of money than it received
from the town, thus' more than doub
ling the expenditure on the patroled
road over the uverago amount per
mile spent in town. In order to have
Cue patrol system it is not necessary
to take any action in town meeting
as the selectmen and road commis
rioner have full authority to act Tor
the town.
Dust laying
The State will match the villages
in the e.vpense cf purchasing oil or
other materials for dust laying on
principal streets up to a' total of $300
When it is recalled that, every dollar
contributed by the State for any form
of road maintenance comes from Ihe
automobile taxes it Is, evident that
the auto users have some right. The !
automobile fund for 1914 amounted to
about $140,000.00, or the equivalent
of a 6 per cent, tax on tho entire
grand list of the Etate. For 1015 the
fund will bo larger.
Construction Funds
The returns from the State tax of
5 per cent, and the money especially
voted in any town and matched by
the State from the $200,000 appropria
tion constitute a joint fui'd to be ex
pended under the direction of the
State CommisKioner. The selectmen '
and road commissioner are consulted
regarding the location of the work
and the plans. Tho foreman, or spe"
cial commissioner to take charge of
the work. Is appointed by the State '
Commissioner. Sometlntos the road
commissioner is appointed, but usual-
ly not as his time should properly J
he glw n to the maintenance work.
In planning the work the general
policy is to rebuild tho worst spots
on the important roads first, cutting j
down the steepest grades, widening
the narrow places, straightening the
worst bends and draining or filling
the swampy locutions. The State may
supplement the funds for especially
extensive or difficult work from the '
surplus fund, on liberal terms with
the towns. This is frequently done

Is Caught With the Goods
ARRESTED II N0R1H ADAMS
Charged with Breaking Into Lunch
Wagon and With Theft from
Shaftsbury Farmer. , ij
Officers Brazil and Hurley made a
trip to North Adams last, night and
were accompanied on their return by
George Maloney against whom two
charges of thieving are preferred.
The iirst of the alleged offences was
committed about 4 o'clock Thursday
morning when tho lunch wagon ou
South street vas broken into and a
sweater Ijelonging to the proprietor,
F. W. Corbett, was stolen. A check
with Mr. Corbett's Indorsement was
also taken. Both check and Bweater
are alleged to have been found in Ma
loney's possession, the check having
been concealed between his two
shirts.
It is presumed that Maloney, who
says his home is in Walerbury, Vt..
left Bennington on Thursday with the
intention of seeking a job in the lum
ber camps but' while on his way he
hired out to work for Rollln Mattison,
a Shaftsbury farmer. Mr. Mattison
yesterday leit home for the purpose
of getting a saw filed and upon his re
turn tho hired man was. missing. A
gold watch lieloivrlng ,to Mr. Matti
son's son had disappeared as had also
a pair of 'Mr. Mattison's shoes. The
shoes and the watch are alleged to
have been found upon Maloney'.i per
son when he was searched in North
Adams.
When the theft was discovered, Mr..
Mattison came 10 '' Bennington and
gave information to the officers. Ma
loney wus traced to North Adams
where every possible assistance look
ing to his arrest was accorded Ho
Was finally run down by Capt. Jones
and Officer William Scully of the
North Adams police force and turned
over to the Bennington officials
The Pleasure Was All His.
Harold Jarvis, .Detroit's well known
singer, always tries to please and be
accommodating. The other day a gush
ing young thing, one of those pests
who like to rub elbows with nnd flatter
the mighty, hud been telling how mueh
i-he Admired his singing.
'Oh, Mr. Jarvis," she was saying as
she rolled her eyes In what she sup
posed was a soulful manner. "I do so
adore your singing. I want when I
die that you sing at my funeral."
Here Mr. Jury is, never thinking how
it was going to sound, replied in his
most gracious lnaniK'r:
C!,C-':r; "it- !-! fft, rT7iit::i m."
where t he road to be built Is of much
importance to through traffic and of
relatively little importance to the
town. For example, in 1911, the
State apportioned nearly $G0i from
the surplus fund to the town of Sears
burg for the extension of the work
in that town on the Bennington-Brat-tleboro
route.
BridgfS Construction
The small appropriation made,, for
bridge work , $15,000 annually places
a narrow restriction on the propor
tion of the cost of bridge construction
that the Stato can bear and no fund
was available for paying any part
of the cost until 1915. For several
years the State has furnished engin
eering services to towns requesting
such assistance by paying the salary
of on engineer to give advice in re
gard to location and plans of construc
tion or repairs nnd to supervise the
work. Tills is an important feature
of the road work us the increasing
amount of traffic and weight of loads
is making tho bridge problem more
serious -year by year. Bridge build
ing is a highly technical operation
and engineering advice Is necessary
in order to secure safe structures on
the one hand and to avoid unneces
sarily expensive work on the other.
In 1914 up to October 1st, 28 towns
in tho Stato received free egineering
services on bridge work. In 1915
three bridges in Bennington County
were built wiiii funds furnished in
part by tho State.
As in maintenance work, the State
supervises all construction toward
which It contributes funds. The
County Supervisor is tho representa
tive of the State Commissioner in the
administration of the road work with
in the County, laying out, planning
and supervising tho work, nnd all
work must be approved by him.
