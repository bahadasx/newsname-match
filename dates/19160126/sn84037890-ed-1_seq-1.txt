Farmers Form a New Or-
ganization
FOR MARKETING OF TOBACCO
"Farmers Tobacco Associa
tion" Is to Be Formed
on February 2.
AfERE IMPELLED INTO ACTION
The Owensboro Messenger of Sun
dny says:
All existing tobacco organizations
were declared to be out of existence
and a new organization of farmers
created Saturday afternoon at the
court house. The Green River Asso
ciation, one of the oldest of the or
ganizations, and the one that has
maintained Itself through all the
various troubles that these Institu
tions have passed through recently,
had called a district meeting.
President W. O. Rlney called the
session to order. He Immediately
recognized Henry S. Berry, "who of
fered the following resolutions ' for
consideration:
"Whereas, the tobacco growers of
the Green River section, being to
tally unorganized, are experiencing
conditions that, if not remedied,
will result In bankruptcy to tho
growers and general decline in all
farm values:
"It was with a general feeling of
skepticism that we were forced to
accept the loose leaf floor system of
Eelllng tobacco. For the last two
seasons all other ways of selling to
bacco have been abandoned. The
loose leaf system has been welched
and found wofully waht'lngr "in tho
first place, practically all of the
Green River district has been forced
to come to Owensboro, theroby cre
ating a great congestion. The loose
leaf floors are crowded from day to
day. Tobacco -almost without ex
ception, Is selling nt a price below
the 'cost if production. The cost of
selling, which the farmer must pay,
k enormous. It now takes at least
Wfce week from the time the farmer
plits his tobacco on the wagon at
liome, until he gets his check. Of
ten during this delay, the farmer's
tobacco damages In the' basket on
-So loose leaf floor, thereby causing
it to sell at a lower prlco on account
of damage, caused by tho slow pro
cess of the loose leaf floor. Prac
tically all of tho outlying receiving
pointj are closed" and these farmers
are confronted with an enormous ex
pense in marketing their tobacco.
These conditions have become un
bearable. Tobacco growing has be
come unprofitable. A cry has gone
up over tho land for relief, and that
tho tobacco growers get together In
one compact organization. 'There
fore bo it
Resolved, That appreciating our
helpless, unorganized condition, and
appreciating tho fact that battling
singly we "aro helpless, but organized
Into one body wo are all powerful, n
fact appreciated by the buying end:
"Therefore, bo It the sense of this
body that wo ask that all the old
associations disband, terminate their
existence as tpbacco organizations,
and let us turn this meeting Into
a mass meeting of tobacco growers.
Let us proceed to organize, to elect
a temporary chairman and take
steps to form a new organization for
the handling of the tobacco grown In
the Green River district."
Short discussion of Mr. Berry's
resolution was had by various per
sons, .present, when it was adopted
by a rising vote. For a temporary
chairman, - Henry S. Berry was
named and elected by tho large num
ber of farmers present.
Numerous name3 of men were sug
gested for temporary socretary, all

Green River Tobacco Growers As
sociation, following the adoption of
Mr. Berry's resolution, made a state
ment In which he endorsed the ac
tion of tho mass meeting. Ho said
that tho Green River, was at present
heartily In favor of forming a major
organization, and It stood ready to
turn over to It what money tho
Green River hnd In Its treasury.
R. H. Ford, who was recently
elected president of the Green River,
to succeed Mr. Rlney to take office
on April 1, Indorsed this action of
Mr. Rlney fully. Out of the GOO
farmers present at the meeting there
were men present from all parts of
Daviess county and men who had
formerly belonged to all tobacco or
ganizations. Chairman Berry asked the farm
ers present to extend to nil of the
officers of nil former organizations a
rising vote of thanks for their work.
This was done amid cheers.
The new organization, by a unan
imous vote of tho3e at tho conven
tion, was given the name of the
Farmers' Tobacco Association. Fol

"It goes mighty hard to say that
I cannot respond affirmatively to the
very attractive invitation to visit
Lynchburg, but I want frankly to
tell you Just why it seems to me lm-
possible. I do not think that Con-
gress quite realizes the genuine de-
mand of the country for an adequate
plaa of preparation for national
fense. I feel that It is my duty to
explnln this matter to tho country
nnd summon Its support, and that l
ought to devote my whole energy
without turning aside to tho busi
ness of this session In which I wish
to be of assistance in every possible
nhd legitimate way"
AMERICAN'S TORTURED
BY MEXICAN' BANDITS
El Paso, Tex., Jan. 22. The bod
ies of tho victims of the Santa Ysa
bdl massacre, which took place Jan
uary 10, were horribly multllated,
and several must have suffered terri
bly before death put an end to their
tortures, according to n detailed re
port of Dr. F. E. Miller, of El Paso.
Dr. Miller made an examination
of'oach body to determine ante and
post mortem wounds and causes of
death. The report was nndo to a
representative of the State Depart
ment. The report shows that some
of Hie victims were shot many times,
even after death. Soft-nosed bullets
made terrible wounds.
Several of the men were stabbed
or slashed with sabers or machetes,
both before and nfter they died.
Sword bayonets also were used by
the bandits, C. R. Watson, the lead
er of the mining men, being thrust
through the body after death, nnd
Alexander Hall' dying of a bayonet
stab in the neck.
In at least four cases tho Ameri
cans were clubbed and beaten with
a crowbar or rifle barrel.
BIBLICAL HISTORY CITY
I CAPTURED BY RUSSIAN'S
London, Jan. 22. Hamadan,
which the Russian army operating In
Persia has occupied, figures In Bibli
cal as well as early Grecian history.
It was the ancient Ecbatana, the
treasure city captured and plundered
by Alexander the Great, and It ap
pears In the Book of Esther as Shu
sham, where Ahasuerus, who "reign
ed from India even into Ethiopia,"
gavo way to tho caprices of Vashtl
and was Induced to relent by the at
traction of Esther.
At .Hamadan pious Jews still point
out the tombs of Mordecai and Es
ther, which stand in a wooden-domed
building In tho center of the
town. There Is no doubt that the
two wooden sarcophagi shown there
are ancient, but there is some ques
tion of their being what tradition as
cribes. They bear Hebrew inscrip
tions, one said to be of A. D. 5 3 7
and tho other 841 A. D. Near the
city a large mound Is pointed out as
tho site of tho palace of Ahasuerus.
A crudely carved Hon, on the site,
Is the subject of much legend also.
Five miles from Hamadan, In a
mountain gorge, is a famous stone
with Inscriptions in the Persian,
Median nnd Babylonian languages,
UiIch seems to havo been placed
thero by Xerxes. These Inscriptions
supplied tho key that enabled tho
cuneiform inscriptions nt Nineveh to
be deciphered. The natives believe
treasure Ilea burled under the stone.

ment mado to-night by Andreas
Garcia, Mexican Consul here.
"Tho Durans confessed their
crime, were sentenced to death to
day and a firing squad will execute
the penalty," said Mr. Garcia.
Akers was shot and killed by the
Mexicans yesterday nenr San Loren
zo, Chihuahua, a few miles south
of the border, whither he had gone
with Douglas Downs, another Amer
ican, nnd Juan Barrios, a Mexican
detective, to recover some stolen cat
tle. Downs escaped and brought
news of Akers' death to the border.
Bert L. Aker's body was brought
to this side of the river this after
noon for burial. He came here re
cently from Horse Cave. Ky., and
purchased ono of the finest dairy and
alfalfa farms In tho lower Rio
Grande Valley. Ho had stocked It
with blooded cattle and had recently
built a farmhouse on it for himself
and family. He was a neighbor of
Gen. Felipe Angeled, the famous
Villa General of artillery, who also
has a big dairy In the Rio Grande
Valley.
Akers was killed while doing a
gratuitous service for a widow, Mrs.
M. Murphy, who lived adjoining his
place. Her milch cows had been
stolen and Akers offered to go across
and locate them. Unarmed, ho went
to the Mexican side after noon with
Downs and was shot down as he ap
proached tho homo of the Duran
gang of bandits. Downs escaped by
hiding In the brush.

at Juarez. The body of Akers was
Interred hero late to-day.
Tho Duran brothers died cursing
Americans. Bernardo appealed for
mercy on behalf of his brother, Fe
derico. "It Is unjust to kill two of us for
ono American," ho said. "It Is giv
ing two eyes for one tooth. I am
willing to die, because I killed the
Gringo, but my brother ought to be
allowed to live."
The bullets of the firing squad
killed Federico, but Bernardo was
stilt conscious after ho fell and the
officers commanding tho tiring squad
gavo liim the "mercy shot" through
