POLITICAL SPARKS.
Candidates for Republican Honors Com
ing to the Front.
K. W. Austin, congressman troni the
second district, wants to be delegate at
large to the National Republican ton
vention, at Chicago, June 7. He fa -
vors Congressman Sam R. Sells, of the
first district, for national committee
man. L J. Human, of Wartburg, is a can
didate for delegate to the Republican
National Convention from this fourth
district.
The republicans of Putnam county
have endorsed Senator John J. Gore.jsf
Gainesboro, for governor, and W. F.
Clouse, of Monterey, for elector for
this fourth district. J. Q- McDonald,
of Byrdstown, is also an aspirant for
the same place.
A split has come in the republican
ranks in Hamilton county, which re
sulted in February 11 being chosen as
the date for the convention to choose
delegates tu the state convention at
Nashville, May 3, to name repbulican
nanrtidatBs for governor, United States
Senator, and choose delegates and al
ternates to the republican national con
vention. Former Senator Newell
Sanders favored a later date tot
holding the county convention. The
early county convention date is consid
red by some as the first movement to
destroy the Sanders influence.
Judge G. P. Burnett, of Cumberland
county, is a receptive, but not a con
testing, candidate for the republican
nomination tor floater trom the el. v
enth floterial district.
Owing to the large democratic ma
jority in this ninth senatorial district
close to 900 no republican aspirant
has as yet sought the nomination.
Owing to the fact that Senator T. E.
Wilson won his election two years ago
by only 100 votes, some claim the old
time democratic majority has passed
tor all time.
John W. Overall seems the moat
likely republican candidate tor govern
or and former Governor Ben W. Hooper
for U. S. Senator.
Congressman Sam R. Sells, ot the
first district, and R. W. Austin, of the
second district, sem likely to nave no
opponents for election this year.
Governor T. C. Rye bids fair to re
ceive the democratic nomination for
governor to succeed himself.
NOT GUILTY. SAYS VILLA.
General Villa sends word to the
American people by a courier that had
ridden hard for three days, that he was
in no way guilty of the death of the
seventeen Americans killed by Mexi
can bandits. He further states that he
will execute them if he can catch them,
even though they be his own men.
Villa is said to be ga
to again begin war on
ranza.

1N CHINA.
The dissatisfaction over the republic
of China being returned to a monarchy
has caused quite an extensive uprising
in some provinces and in recent battles
between the government and rebels the
government troops were defeated.
Indications are that much trouble is
in store for the monarchy.
WAR SITUATION.
The proposed peace conditions be
tween Austria-Hungary and Montene
gro is off and tbe Montenegrins will
tight to the end. This position of the
little monarchy was the result ot as
surances on the part of the allies that
all she has lost should be finally re
stored to her.
The situation in Greece is still criti
cal. The king has given to the news
agencies a denunciation of the course
of the allies in so flagrantly violating
u ...
ureeK ncuoani..
The Russians and British have been
getting the best of the Turks in the
Caucasus and Mesopotamia. On the
other fronts nothing of importance is
going on as fighting is at a lull, except
the artillery duels, sapping and mining
and fighting with hand grenades.
WOULD THIS PREVENT WAR?
Could Such a Plan Be Inaugurated and
Carried Out?
The following taken trom "Equity,"
magazine published in the interest of !
the Initiative and Referendum and Re- j
j call, would seem to be one solution of
tne problem of war, if nations could be I
induced to enter into such an agree-.
ment. At thi time, however, there is i
almost no likelihood that any of the
leading nations would consider it ser
iously for a moment. Yet it is inter
esting to consider and we give it as
food for thought :
"No nation can be a hermit in these
days of steamships, railroads, tele
graphs, ocean cables, wireless, etc.
Hence there must be international re
lations. But there is no international
body authorized to control these neces
sary international relations.
"Instead of the sovereignty of every
nation stopping at us own boundaries, j
these sovereign powers are extended
far beyond national boundaries, into j
the maze of international affairs, and i
across every sea. Is it any wonder
that these sovereignties ".lash:
"The remedy for international war
and the basis for international peace is
so plain that the merest novice should
see it.
"International relations and the con
trol of the sea uelong naturally to an
international body.
"It is equally plain that such an in
ternational body should consist of offi
cial representatives of all the nations,
on as nearly just a basis of representa
tion as can be approximated.
"Suppose no national standing army
coula go beyond its national boundaries
without the consent ot the internation
al body: w dd nations then spend
much money i i standing armies?
"Suppose t ) national battleship
could bo outsi ne of the three mile limit
from the nai onal coast without the
consent of ne international body:
would nations tne build many battle-!
ships?
"Of course I international body, i
call it conaress. I'oiiiniHSlon, interna-!
lional govern or by whatever
name you desire, must have force at
its command sufficient to accomplish
its purposes.
"But by constructive administrative
processes it could sr. promote the inter
ests of al the nations that there would
be no possible motive for international
wars
"How ridiculous it would be for
Ohio to even think of lighting Indiana!
"Charles Fremont Taylor. "
WHAT LANGUAGE WILL BE USED
When the Peace Agreement s Formu
lated at Close of War?
In what language
at the end of the
will be drawn up, I
war the Act of 1
Agreement between the now warring
nations? This document will be one of
the most important in the history of
the world. It must be a model of pre
cision. No doubt whatever Bhould ex
ist as to its meaning. It must be quite
intelligible to all the "High Contract
ing Parties.'
Will it be in French, so long the lan
guage of diplomacy? Or in English,
the most widespread commercial lan
guage? Will not the Germans and
Austriars have an equal light to de
mand that the language id the Treaty
shall I"' in German? The Russians or
tbe Japanese or the Serbs would pos
sibly not object if the language of one
of their Allies were used, but the
Tmks might be offended it French or
English were chosen.
The people ot the Unitei. btates win
probably have something to do regard- j
mg the Peace Treaty, and it is possible
that the selection of the language tojbe
used will be placed in their hands.
Their natural choice would be English,
the official language of their country.
But, although this would be satisfac
tory to the British, it would hardly be
so to the other nations. In whicn di
rection can the Americans turn them
selves to find a neutral tongue? Will
it be to Spain or to the Netherlands?
So there will come a fitting opportu
nity tor the use of Esperanto. It is
neutral, it fulfills every condition
needed for use in a contract between
different nations. It is international
and already well known in all coun
tries. It is simple, precise and logi
cal. It is easily and accurately tra"s
lataole into other languages. It is th"
language of Peace. The envoys, if
they do not already know it, can at
least learn its entire grammar during
their voyage to The Hague, or other
place of meeting.
Let us then, as Esperantists in what
ever country we may be, ca I the at
teution of our Ambassadors to the ti -ness
of Esperanto for that purpose ar!
request that it ne used in writine the
Treaty of Peace. - Freely translated

STICKS IN HIS CEMENT BED

night in a bed of concrete and it had
hardened more or less during the night.
It was late in the evening, after the
rest of the people of Bayard had re-

stumbled toward home. A new cement

Find Curious Siberian Tribe.
The last members of the Siberian
expedition promoted by the Oxford
university's school of anthropology
and the Philadelphia museum have
returned to London with a rich col
lection of material and new informa
tion about a strange region.
The strangest tribe met in their
travels was the Tungus, a primitive
nomad people of the Mongolian type,
who live to themselves, have only
vague notions about the Russians and
the czar and no system of writing.
They live in wigwams and have no oc
cupation other than the breeding of
reindeer and- the hunting of white
foxes. Their religion is a belief in
good and evil spirits.
A large collection of costumes, wea
pons, implements and copper and iron
ornaments was brought home by the
expedition.
Close Estimating.
A geologist of the United
States
geological survey once estimated 3,000
feet as the necessary depth to drill in
a certain locality to find water, with
the result of less than 1 per cent of
error, a flow measuring 500,000 gallons
a day having been struck at a depth
of 2,987 feet. In another branch of
the work of the survey, that of esti
mating at the close of the calendar
year the production of the various
minerals during that year, even this
percentage of error is being reduced.
The surveys estimate on January 1,
1915, of the production of iron ore
was 41,440,000 long tons; the actual
figures received from all the com
panies are now seen to be 41,439,761
long tons, a difference of only 239
tons.
Real Favor.
"It annoys me to be reading a war
dispatch and come to a sentence in
which the name of a town or fortress
is represented by a dash," snid the
fretful man.
That doesn't worry me any," re
plied the cheerful citizen.
"I should think it would."
"No. You see, I have an idea that
I wouldn't be able to pronounce the
name, anyway, and the censor saves
me the trouble of trying."
Japs Pay Higher Prices for Food.
Imported foods, on the average, coat
in Japan from 10 to 15 per cent more
than before the war. Increases in
freight s-nd insurance are chiefly
blamed 'or the rise Imported butter
has risen 20 per cent, and is still
mounting, largely due to the fact that
the belligerent powers in Europe have
prohibited the export of butter.
Signs Shot Into Place.
A gun which shoots signs into place
has been invented, which, in appear
ance. is not unlike a shotgun. The
sign, which it discharges, is rolled
tightly about a heavy stick and a cord
is attached to a tack which is tempo
rarily fastened, point out, at one end
of this. The other end of the string
is fastened to the top of the sign.
When the instrument is loaded with
one of these and the trigger pulled,
heavy
force, springs furnish the propelling j
which sends the roll endwise
through the air like an arrow, at
whatever object it is aimed. The tack
imbeds itself, while the Jar of the in
pact loosens tne sign ana makes li

There is no one set of facts
and another in practice.
facts are facts, and true in both theory
and practice. If anything is not cor
rect in practice it is not correct in the
oty, it is false theory.
Let us start out with a clear under
standin g that facts are facts and that
while our theories and pract.ces may
, , . .
be wrong' facts are eternal ttath;
ways be facts, but the foolish idea that
1 anything
that is true is not always
true in farm practice, or anywhere
else, has done more to retard the spread
of useful facts among farmers than all
other things combined.
Theories may be false and practices
bad, but the only way we can tell
which is correct and which is wrong is
through a full knowledge of the basic
facts of agricutlure.
Beyond any doubt the class of men
most influenced by theories often
false theories is the farmer. This is
because the facts are sc hard to find
out and the experience of any one man
is so small.
tin only has experience with one
farm, once a year, and each year some
of the conditions change, so that the
experie ce of any one man is so small
that he can never rind out the whole
truth for himself. It is only when we
bring together the experiences and dis
coveries of thousands of fanners and
experimenters for all past ages that
we can find tne truth, the averages, the
basic facts, which are tlit onl safe
guide in practice.
EXPERIMENTS AND EXPERIENCE
Again let us fully understand that
experiments mean experience. An ex
perimenter is merely a man who has
special and increased means of obtain
ing experience. For instance, the ex-
perimenter has experiene one year with
SO or 40 varieties of cotton or fertilizer
mixtures, whereas the tamer has ex
perience with one or two at most.
What I want my young friends, the
boys, to fully realize is that the plants,
soils and animals with which the ex
perimenter works, have none ot the
foolish prejudices, so common among
all people; but grow for him just as
they do fo the farmer.
if he experiments with forty varie
ties he has just forty times the experi
ence of the man who experiments with,
or grows ane. Experience is the best
teacher, hut it is so expensive that no
farmer can have enough on his own
farm to meet his best needs.
Is it true tnat there is no more rea
son why the farm boy should know the
baisc iacts of agriculture than that the
doctor should know the basic facts
about medicine, or that the lawyer
Bhould know the basic f'iu'ts of the
law? Tnerenone whatever.
Early in life tbe wrtier li
.irned that
his influence with those he n
;t and Hid
business with was largely in proportion
to his knowledge of the lines nt work
they were cbieriy interested in. Eight
out of every ten people we meet in te
South are most largely interested in
agriculture.
If my experience is a safe guide,
every boy who learns the basic tacts of
agriculture will be better able to im
press and influence for good those he
meets, and his lite with those about
him will be more useful and pleasant
Here then is a reason, whicn does not
apply with the same force to other pro
pit and lines of work, why the South
ern boy should know tbe basic facts of
'agriculture.
What will such knowledge do for the
farm hoy?
If a boy knows why it jars him more
to jump off a bench stiff-legged than it
does when he allows his legs to bend at
the knees and hips, he will not pick
out a horse with short, straight front
pasterns (the fportion of the leg be
tween the hoof and the fetlock, or as
It 1S wrongfully called, the ankle joint)

of butter is made by certain "germs"

The boy who knows which insects de
stroy crops by eating the plants and
which by sucking their juices, will not
waste time and money trying to poison
insects which do not eat, the outside of
the plants.
The boy who knows which plant
foods or fertilizers are leached out of
the soil by and in the water that passes
down through it and which are not,
will know better when and how to ap
ply his fertilizers and better how to
manage his soils and crops to prevent
losses of plant foods.
The pig club boy who knows that
protein, the material out of which lean
pork is made, cannot be made by the
pig, but must be supplied ready-made
for him in his feed, is more likely to
feed a balanced ration and his pig is
more likely to win the prize.
The ooy who knows that some plants,
like oats and wheat, suffer from smut,
the "seeds ' of which are on the grain
when sowed; while other plants, like
corn, suffer from smut caused by
"spores ' which fall on the growing
plant, will not only know which seeds
he should treat to prevent smut, but he
is also more likely to do it.
If a corn club buy knows that it takes
3,(100 to 3,500 gallons of water to make
a bushel of corn and that a soil so fine
that it takes 1,000 soil particles or
grains side by side to measure an inch
will have 100 times as much surface
space lor the water to stick to, as a
soil so csarse that ic takes only 10 par
ticles or soil grains side by side to
measure an inch, will be more likely to
learn how to make his soil as fine as
possible; and better stili, he will be
more likely to do, that is, to make a
good seed bed.
A boy who knows that some weeds
make seeds every year from which the
plant must grow the next season ; that
other plants live two years and that
still others live on year after year and
make seeds and also underground stems
from both of which new plants grow,
will know better how to avoid the
worst weeds and better how to destroy
all weeds which may trouble him.
The boy who knows what cause milk
to sour is more likely to learn how to
handle milk so it will not sour too soon.
The girl who knows what causes the
bread or the cake to "rise" is less
likely to make "soggy" bread or cake.
The boy who gueses may have to

he goes right, while the boy who knows
goes right Iron, the start. The farther
we travel the wrong road the harder it
is to get back where we can start on
the right road and tliu more time and

way. That is the difference between

ON THE MEXICAN BORDER.
Bert Akers, a nacive of Kentucky,
was killed just over the Mexican bor
der Friday. He had gone across the
line to look after some stolen cattle
and was shot by one ot the cattle rust
lers. The Mexicans who did the kill
ing were brothers. They have been
arrested and have confessed to the
deed and they were executed.
Showing the World Moves.
One of themost startling things of
all up the tabernacle way is to walk
suddenly into the cafeteria and see
standing there an old-fashioned, sweet
faced, gray haired woman the exact
replica of your dead and gone grand
mother calmly munching a "hot dog"
sandwich and sipping coffee out of a
cumbersome receptacle bearing all the
earmarks of a shaving mug.
The look of keen enjoyment on her
face is proof positive that she has
always wanted to do this very thing,
but never had a oause so justifiable
before. Philadelphia Record.
