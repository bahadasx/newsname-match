Representations by United States.
The United States government ad
dressed a note to Japan with regard to
the demand made upon China, querying
in particular with respect to throe
points:
The selection of foreign advisers -by
China the purchase of war irtunltlons,
and the question of foreign loans.

the note on March 22.
On May 25, two treaties between
Japan and China, together with thir
teen notes, wese signed In the Chinese
foreign office, covering, it was an

reached on the Japanese demands, of
which, however, five articles were left
for ulterior argument. It was under

consideration were those of group five.
The articles in this group were origi
nally seven In number but it was later

displaced by pledges that China would
undertake no military or naval prepa

Villa Stirs fiaoial Hatred.

forces of the Carranza government, ls
using the cry. "Remember Orozoo," toesM^

gain recruits for himself, according1'..'
to foreigners who reached (he fcarder^
today.
thej
General Orosco was General Vllla'a* «,
most formldlble foe until the Jtyter
drove him across the hortfr Into thei ..
United States after the battle off'
OJinags, nearly two years ago. Oroseo"
wa» shot aasd kiUed last September on
this side of the boundary some thne'
after h^ had forfeited the bond under*
which he was being held aa violator
of United States neutrality laws. Villa,
taking advantage of the circumstances
of Orosco's death, is declared to be
using his name as a rallying cry for
new recruits.
Western Chihuahua was the home of
Orosco as well as that of Villa, and
the dead leader had a -large following
which ls said to have been highly in
flamed recently when Villa informed
them that Orozco had been murdered
in Texas by Americans.
Villa Permitted to Caoape.
The reports were brought to the
border by foreigners who were in
Chihuahua City during the trying
period just before and after Villa
evacuated the capital. They deolared
that tho Carranza army remained a
short distance out of the city for forty
eight hours while Villa prepared to
abandon the place. Reports were cur
rent at the time that Villa was to be
allowed to escape.
Thirty-six Americans were herded
into prison Just before Villa left the
city, a number of Chinese were shot...
and the stores belonging to them and
to Japanese merchants were looted and
burned. Villa made a point, they said,
of not threatening Englishmen and
Germans.
The bandit chief announced that he
intended to hold the Americans until
they paid over $30,000, but they were
finally released when Villa was told
that freeing was the only condition
under which he would be allowed to
enter the United States If he were
forced to flee northward.
