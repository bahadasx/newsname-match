These Early Chickens.
The article in this paper last
week on early chickens seems to
have cused considerable interest
from the talk that has resulted
along that line. Some of them
think that for early chickens
they have those other fellows
mentioned last week skinaed a
city block.
J. P. Kennemur reports that
he had a nice hatching on Christ
mas day.
Mrs. Chas. White says that she
had 32 head hatch the last days
of December and all doing fine.
In this connection it might be
added that when the fall shows
come any male chicken hatched
in 101C is considered a cockerel
and any fomale chicken hatched
in 101(3 is considered a pullet.
From this anything hatched the
latter yart of 1015 might bo con
sidered late while that hatched
the first of 101(3 is early.
o
Elgin Lost Game.
The junior basket bAll team
played a Fletcher team here Sat
urday afternoon which resulted
26 to 20 in favor of Flotcher.
The defeat is attributed by some
to the fact that the Elgin girlR
did not do enough "rooting" in
the first half to put ginger into
the local team and that the
Fletcher playera were much lar
ger than the home boyu.
At the dose of the first half
the score stood IS to Gin favor of
Flotcher. During the socond
half the Elgin rooters woke up
and stirred the boys so that the
scores made in the second half
were M to 8 in favor of Elgin.
The local players were Oscar
and Paul RoBe. Earl Morgan,
Harold Putney, Ruel Wolcott.

They Washed His Face.
While the snow was on
the ground last week the
young folks aad some of the eld
er ones seems disposed to In
dulge in pranks not often seen In
Oklahoma because ei the small
amount of snowfall ia this state.
There were a aanteer of comi
cal incidents but ene of the most
comical that has come to eur at
tention was where two school
ma'ams proceeded to wash an
old bachelors face.
Whether they thought his face
was dirty and needed washing
because he bad no lady love to
look after hie domestic affalrs.or
what else it was that prompted
them to do the rash aet, has not
been learned.
But they proceeded to give
him a wi.shing just the samoand
that right in the presence of sev
eral witnesses. And some of
them say that he fought like a
coyote surrounded by a pack of
hounds.
In their endeavor and determi
nation to do a good job and get
his face perfectly clean 'tis said,
that one of the school ma'ams
actually had both arms clear a
round him, to which he did not
object so much as to the appla
nation that was being given to
his face.
