LONDON, Eng., Jan. 20.
Great Britain' stands firmly by her
recent seizure anil detention of U.
K. mails, the action having been
taken on the ground that sympa
thizers of Germany were sending
contraband through the malls.
The foreign office today handed
the American embassy an ad in
terim' reply to the American pro
test against detention of first-class
matter. The formal answer will
be made soon.
France, it . is announced, signi
fies her approval of the British
Attitude. It is understood that the
formal reply will defend the ac
tion of Great Britain and eite evi
dence that Germany has been
abusing the privileges of first-class
mail. .Z
HAGNF CONVENTION
COVERS MOST POINTS
WASHINGTON,' D. C In all prob
ability Great Britain will have to es
tablish a precedent for Interference
- u-ith iha mafia nf neutral rnnntrloi hv
a belligerent In time of war. Govern
ment officials here have failed to find
one which would serve as a guide In
tne controversy oetween wasmngiou
and London over mail seizures.
As far as parcel post malt Is con
cerned, no CJicrence nas yet arisen
between the two governments. The
Unite States has not claimed that
-parcel ; :i la protected by The Hague
Convrr. . n of October 18, 1907, or by

Contraband Under Seat.
Whllo all governments regard the
teals on mall bags as Inviolate, and
me oreamng or mem is loonea upou
as a most delicate matter, It can be
said with authority that the United
States will not stand back of its own
citizens or non-citizen aliens in this!
country who may seek to protect con
traband In the mails by sending , it
first class undtr seaL
Under the universal postal convex
tlons and International usage patrons
of the' malls have no right to send
merchandise In first class mail under
seal. The conventions limit merchan
dise so mailed to samples.. Anything
hpvond a Ka.mnl6 must be sent by par
cel post and the first class mails do
not protect It.
There la a question whether nego
tiable securities do not properly be
long under jthe head tf contraband,
since they can be converted into mon
ey, which is" generally regarded as
contraband. Therefore, should Great
Britain or any other belligerent seize
securities of. or , suspected of enemy
origin or destination they probably
would be within their rights.
So far as Washington knows off I
daily, Great-Britaln has not yet gone
beyond seizing parcel mail, despite
contrary reports, and ter right to do
so is conceded. It is known to offi
cials that the British authorities con
template going much- further.- If the
6el2ure of first ' class ' mall is limited
to packages sent in that way to evade
capture of articles of contraband des
tined for enemy countries the United
States will have little ground to com
plain; '.
Even first class mall. Including
'postal compondence,, is subject to
seizure if it is made during the block
ade of a port. 'This also is conceded
by American officials. It is specifi
cally covered by The Hague Conven
tion of 1907.

Since Xmas Precipitation Has
Exceeded By 4.03 Inches An
nual Average for 11 Years
Several kinds of freak weather vis
ited Honolulu last night and today.
ranging from a drizzle to a. downpour
and from a light wind to a gust that
blew 54 miles an hour at 9 :54 this
morning for .20 minutes At noon the
wind velocity was only eignt miles an
hour. - : " '
. At--.noon.itie storm had brought the
precipitation for January to 18.03
inches, so that the rainfall for the
month now exceeds that of any other
month in the history of the . local
weather bureau. . ; -
This morning's rainfall, from 8
o'clock to noon, was .68 of an inch.
Last night, between 11 and 12 o'clock,
1.22 Inches fell in 35 minutes. No
vember 12, 1.25 inches fell !i 30 min
utes.';'' ' '-. '
-Last night's and today's rains,
bringing the total for January to date,
to 18.03 Inches, mean that Honolulu
has had. from Christmas down to noon
today, rainfall totaling 26.62 inches,
the local weather bureau stated at
noon. "In other words, since Christ
mas we have had more rain than
usually falls in' an entire year."
The average yearly precipitation
for the last 11 years, since 1905 when
the local weather bureau was estab
lished, has only been 23.80 inches.
Not Real Kona Gale. -
The local forecaster said today that
this is net a genuine kona gale, al
though the wind is from the south.
The barometer has not fallen as much
as in the last kona. This morning at
8 o'clock it stood at 29.87.' Yesterday
at the same time it was 29.92, and
Monday, it was 29.95, wane Sunday It
etood at an even 30.
Because of the barometer's compar
atively small decline, steady high
winds are not looked for, although
heavy rains may continue to fall with
the barometer up. In last week's
kona the barometer descended to a
minimum of 29.66 to January 17.
Rainfall last night, from 8 p. m. to
8 a. m. today, was 1.78 inches. The
present total for January, 18.03, ex
ceeds by . 4.03 inches the highest pre
vious record, that of February. 1893,
when Dr. Robert McKlbbin recorded
14 inches for the month;' The great
est precipitation for one month since
the local weather bureau was estab
lished, was 12.44, in January, 1907.
The. average January rainfall for 11
years has been only 3 81 inches. '

bv Uiononese
: f Associated Press Service by Federal Wireless.
LONDON, En Jan. 26. That Japan has presentnl to China
a new list of seven demands which imperil ; the sovereignty of the
Chinese nation and menace the interest of foreigners there is infor
mation which the Manchester Guardian, particularly well-informed
on Oriental affairs, prints as coming from Far Eastern sources.
It is said that Japan has handed the Chinese minister at Tokio
for transmission to China a note embolying seven demands which
were included in the Japanese program last spring.
The Guardian expresses the hope that the news will be ''authori
tatively contradicted," as the previous demands, it declares, presag
ed full danger to China's independence. "It is the hope of Hritish
policy," says the Guardian, "to see China s,troug and independent
Our duty is to help in that direction." '
It is possible that the seven demands alluded to today were the
original seven of "Group Five" of the series presented last spring.
WASHINGTON 1). C, Jan. 26. Many diplomats here, wheif
informed that Japan has apparently renewed the demands made
DUt not acceDted last snnnc. pxnrpsa thp hoMpf that th onlv nnwpp
. I o 1 . g " ' -
in a position to make effective protest against the renewal of the
Japanese demands is the United States. The United States has
never taken an open position against Japan on this matt ex but is
understood to, regard all the articles of Group Five as objectionable.
DEMANDS ROUSED MUCH PROTEST IN 1915. v
Much protest was roused in the United Staten and Great Ilritain
last year by Group Five of the Japanese demands., fhe story will
be recalled that Japan first denied the existence of a lvumber of the
demands complained of by China and later explained that the-e deT
mands had nothing to do with international relations and hence no
mention had been made of them to' the Powers. "
China rejected the seven demands of Group Five on the ground
that they virtually surrendered Chinese sovereignty. Others of the
demands were acceded ,to, and.it .was. understood that Japan. con
tinued to press steadily though quietly for acceptance of alU ; '
Group Five in its original form is as follows, and it is believed
that this is about the form in which the whole group was rejected:
-tirucie ;i.iiie uiuese teuirai government snau employ in

"Article 2. Japanese hospitals, churches and schools in the
interior of China shall be granted the right of owning land.
. "Article 3. Inasmuch as the Japanese government and the Chi
nese government have had many cases of dispute between Japanese
and Chinese police to settle, cases which eaused no little misunder
standing, it is for this reason necessary that the police departments
of important places (in China) shall be jointly administered by
Japanese and Chinese, or that the police departments of these places
shall employ numerous Japanese, so that they may at the same time
help to plan for the improvement of the Chinese police service.
"Article 4. China shall purchase from Japan a fixed amount
of munitions of war (say 50 per cent or more of what is needed by
1 he Chinese government) or that there shall be established in China
a Sino-Japanese jointly worked arsenal. Japanese technical experts
