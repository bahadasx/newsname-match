ALIIANY, N. V Jan. 26. Ilesolu
tlons extending to March 1 tho life
uf the Thompson Public Service In-
vi-Mlfatlug Commlttea and appropri
ating $30,000 additional for expenses
were unanimously adopted by thn Ah
Reinbly to-day. They had passed the
Senate last week.
Just prior to this Chairman Maler
of the Ways and Means Committee
Introduced u bill Intended to muot the
criticisms of Assemblyman It. Hunter
McQuLstton of tho presiut system of
committee expense account.
Adoption of tfin resolutions was pre
ceded" by comment by VJpvnkrr' Hfc-eot
nud Minority Leader Calluluin, but
them was no delate.
Speaker Sweet said thnt public re
IKirts that ho had attempted to Inter
fere with the Thompson Committee's
work were without foundation. 'Hie
refi-renco of the resolutions to the
Ways and Means Committee was
made, ho said, on tho strength of
Chairman Thompson's statement In!
tho Senate that his work was about
completed. When later Thompson
announced Important developments
were expected the Assembly was will
ing to grant the requested appropria
tion and time extension, the Speaker
declai ed.
"Ily uppiovlng tlm resolutions," Cal
lulinn said, "we may lc put lu the
light of ratifying tln ucts of this com
mittee, which exceeded Us appropria
tions." Ho would not oppoio the rcsoluUon.i,
ho uddod, as such opposition would
bo interpreted as nn effort on thn part
of thn minority to hamper the com
mltteo's activities.
Tho views of tho majority of the
Ways and Means Committee on the
McQulstlon situation, Maler nunl,
were reflected In his bill. It would
provide that thn pikiiisch and com
pensation of nil commlttcn and com
mlshlon members and their employees
bo paid to the prrson by whom such
expenses were Incurred, or to whom
such compensation Is due, after "enrh
claim or account shall have been
audited" by tho comptroller.
MiQuistiou, In a statement Issued
after the Introduction of the .Motor
till, said he would insist upon tho
passage of his resolution calling for
a leglslatlVH Investigation. It now
Is before tho Wnyn and Menus Com
mittee. Ills Insistence, ho said, was
due to his deslio to se corrected
"other abuses" in connection with the
upending of money by thn Ix-glsluture,
as well as the safeguarding of com.
inlttue expense accounts.
Senator George F. Thompson Is
back In Now York to-day to resume
his drive against cor nipt Interests
without any string tied to him. Hn Is
elated by his victory against certain
"Intoresti," tlm Assembly and the

"The "ommlttee will lesume work

FIGHT TO DISMI8S INDICTMENTS
LOST.
Tlu one witness of the morning
was Police Captain Oeorge H. Mom
ti o n of tho Providence force. He gave
iiihlltlon.il testimony about the con
fessions of Drown and Spcllman after
tho murder, which thoy have since
repudiated. At tho close of his testi
mony the State closed its case, and
Mr. Cushing asked that the Indlot
ment against Mrs. Mohr be dismissed
ou the ground that' thn shooting of
Dr. Mohr was dune by one man and
not by thlei- as charged In tho In
dictment. "The act of one is the act of three,"
replied Judgo Stearns In denrlng the
motion. If thero was a Joint purpose
they wero Jointly guilty."
Mr. Cushing pr-deitcd also that thn
Indictment thould havo specified that
one trigger finger sent tho bullet Into
Dr. Mohr nud not three, and this
should have been so specified. "I
know this is a technicality," ho said,
"but criminal law Is built upon tech
nicalities." John It. Kdwards, counsel to Spell
man, mtdc similar motion .In behalf
of his client, urging that a no con
spiral had boen churged In the In
dictment Spcllman could not be ad
judged in any wa guilty of tho mur
