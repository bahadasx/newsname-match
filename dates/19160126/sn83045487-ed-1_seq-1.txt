Here are some of the reasons the
Anifj-ican Jewish relief committee
gives for wanting to raise a large
fund here:
In Russia alone nearly 750,000
Jews are homeless. Expulsions, start
ed last May, have been systematical
ly followed up with decrees covering
a very wide territory, notices to Jew
ish residents to leave their homes
varying from 3 to 24 hours.
In. May, after first expulsions had
been put into effect, the following
number of refugees were reported by
thp. Jewish Colonization association:
Varsaw, 75,000 .people; Y'lna, 12,-
000; Kielce, 3,000; Kansk, 4,000;
Minsk, 2,000; Prassnysh, 1,500; Ra
dom, 2,000; Gussiatin, 1,200; Shaki
(Suvalki), 1,500; Lomsha, 5,000;
Khmelnik, Prov. Kielce, 1,500. Since
that time these numbers have in
creased almost tenfold.
The commercial life in the Russia
Pale is lyfng waste. The merchants,
great and small, are ruined and un
employment is universal. In Poland
alone there are nearly 300 towns
that have suffered materially from
the war.
In Vienna alone, there are over
300,000 Galician refugees.
