Raise Buckwheat. .
For three reasons every farmer in
this section should raise buckwheat.
First, it is a nutrition grain, none bet
ter for hogs or poultry or in fact when
ground and mix-d with corn cannot be
surpassed for horses aud cattle. Sec
ond, makes excellent bee pasture and
comes at a time when wild llowers have
been exhausted. Third, it will yield
more per aero than Hour wheat and
will actually improve the land. Prom
the middle to the last of June is a, splen
did time to sow t if you want a good
) ield of 'grain, but it can be sown earlier
or later and get good results.
