DIFFICULT PROBLEM TO CARE
FOR THE COMMERCIAL NEEDS
OF THE COUNTRY
(llr AuorlilH Preaa.)
LONDON, Jan. 26. The question of
tonnage for carrying the oversea trade
and particularly the growing scarcity
of tonnage under the British mercan
tile flag Is causing a good deal of an
xiety. A week of two ago, an un
official announcement was made that
work might be resumed on mercantile
' shipbuilding in various yards of Great
Britain but so far no official confirma
tion has been received and from the
meagre reports regarding government
orders In several yards It seems that
there Is very little likelihood or a
transference of any quantity of work
men from government to private con
tracts In the near future.
As about one-fifth of the total mer
cantile tonnage of the country Is com
mandeered for admiralty purposes,
and during the four week ending Dec
ember 8, forty-nine vessels were sunk.
In addition to the already large losses,
It will be seen that there 1s only a
comparatively small margin of boats
are left for carrying the country's
trade.
