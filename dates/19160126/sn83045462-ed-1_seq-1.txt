AWAITING REPLY I
FROMGERMANY
Count von Bernstorff Transmits
U. S. Demands in the
Lusitania Case.
> CONFERENCE ON SUBJECT !
WITH SECRETARY LANSING
Understood Berlin Government Is
Held Strictly Accountable for
Loss of American Lives.
The Lu.-itania agreement was
redrafted today by Count von 1
Bernstorff. the German ambassa- '
dor. and Secretary Lansing to
represent the views of the United 1
States, and was forwarded to the
Berlin foreign office. Word of 1
whether the German government ;
will accept it in its present tenta- !
tive form is expected in about a '
11
V\
After a conference between the I
Secretary and the ambassador. 1
the latter made a new tentative 1
draft which includes all the con- '
tentions of the United States. *
The later proposal from Germany was
rnderstood to be unacceptable to the
United States because it did not admit
f 11 liability for the lives of all the 1
neutrals lost in the destruction of the T
1 ner, although the German govern- I"
n-ent agreed to pay as a matter of b
friendship to the United States. .(l
Contention Regarding Claims. > 0
Id
This government contends the claims)^
should be paid as a matter of law and s
or' right. ! s
If. as is intimated today, the new I J.
draft is fully acceptable to the United
States there is reason for believing it
will be acceptable to Germany, because
t ount von Bernstorff is known to
be acting under wide latitude conferred
by his government for the negotiations.
Inasmuch as the terms of the
settlement are being made with regard
for public opinion in Germany as well
as the United States it is not known
how far the German public will be in- 1
formed of the outcome at this time. s
It was understood that such changes r
as the United States wants made in the
bnmo.spd aerp^mont spt mit in th? !l
document the ambassador prepared to- 1
day.. Jt now awaits the approval of n
the German government.
U. S. Position Stated. v
e
The United States, it was authr>rita- s
ttvely stated today, would insist upon ^
holding the German government to "a a
strict accountability" for the loss of F
American lives and desires that the f
Berlin government admit, in effect, that '
It is liable, according to law, for lives *
of neutrals lost In tlv? commission of an
act against a vessel of the enemy.
Only Stumbling Block. '
From authoritative sources it is s
learned that the stumbling block at
the present time consists of the un- 1
willingness of the German government;
to admit that the course of her sub- !
tr.ar.ne warfare at the time the I.usi- j <
i tnia was destroyed was illegal. J .
Though willing to pay the United i
States indemnity for the lives of the j :
American men. women and children j <
who were lost, the German government j <
? " ""0 *.? V?.. a "J"- | ;
Mire to retain the friendship of the
L'nited States rather than upon an admission
of wrongdoing:.
Diplomatic circles still were optimistic
today regarding the outcome,
despite the United States' refusal to
accept the latest proposal.

FIUPIND FREEDOM
PLANJSJMED
Amendment Acceptable to
President Wilson Submitted
to the Senate.
SELF-GOVERNMENT WITHIN
FOUR YEARS IS PROVIDED
Proposed Agreements Would Protect
Rights and Interests of Americans
in Islands.
Provision for granting Philippine
independence along lines!
believed to he acceptable to
President Wilson was submitted
to the Senate today by Senator
Hitchcock of Nebraska, chairman
af the Philippine committee, as an
intendment to the pending selfgovernment
bill. Senator 11 itchroc
k. after several conferences
w ith the President on the subject,
proposed his amendment as a
torn mi t tee substitute to several
that have been submitted to fix a
.line iui graining mucpeiiuciicc iu j
:lie islands.
Course of Procedure.
The proposed amendment would direct
hat not later than four years, nor less
han two years, after the meeting of the
'ilipino legislature to be created by the
tending bill the President should withr?.w
from the Philippines the sovereignty
if the United States apd proclaim the inlependence
of the Filipino people, provided
t the time he should find that proper
teps had been taken in the islands to
ecure bv peaceful means an independent
Philippine government, "republican in
orrr. stable in character," and prepared
o enter Into such binding agreements
vith the United States as the President
nay deem necessary for the protection of
ecognized rights and interests of Amerians
and other nationals in the islands.
Would Reserve U. S. Rights.
As a condition of independence the
'resident would be empowered to reerve
by definite agreement with the
lew government lands and rights
lecessary for naval bases, coaling staions
and other property required for
The amendment would further pro- ;
ide that, if at any time prior to the j
xpiration of four years, the President j
hould find that proper steps had not j
een taken to establish an independent;
government, "or if he should find it ex- !
ledient for reasons affecting the wel
are of the Filipinos themselves or the \
nternational relations of the United i
hates." or if he should be unable to j
legoti.ate agreements for protection of
American property the President would I,
?e authorized to delay recognition of j
Philippine independence until a new
American Congress could further con- i
lider the case.
Would Invite Co-Operation.
The Hitchcock amendment also would
authorize the President to invite cooperation
of the principal nations of
the world to mutually pledge themselves
to maintain the Philippine independence
against any external force,
or to negotiate such arrangement with
any nations willing to co-operate. This
failing, the President would guarantee
independence on behalf of the United
States alone for five years.
AitacKea oy nepuDiicans.
The proposed administration amendment
vas attacked by Republican senators.
Senator Sutherland said he had no doubt
he President, particularly if a republican
ie elected, would hesitate about with- i
Ira wing, inasmuch as it would be another j
feneration l>efore the American school sys- J
cm had educated the Filipinos up to the i
oirit of self-government After arou'-irig
he hoj>es of the jwople of the Philippines,
ie prophesied it would mean insurrection
ind bloodshed for the President to fail
o establish self-government.
"Keep on adding schools, but say
iothing about independence until we
ire ready to get out." Senator Sutherand
advised. He said that guararreeing
the independence of the islands
neant the extension of the Monroe
ioctrine to Asia with probable disistrous
if not bloody results.
Senator Jones also urged that the
L'nited States retire without entanglenents
when the proper time came to
leave the islands.

PUSH LEGISLATION,
PRESIDENT'S PLEA
0
Mr. Wilson Confers With
Former Recalcitrant Democrats
in Congress.
EXECUTIVE TO STAND BY
SHIPPING BILL TO END
I
Representatives Xitchin and Fitzgerald
and Senator Clarke Urged
to Back Administration Plans.
President W ilson today put in
several hours of diligent work
urging former recalcitrant demo-;
crats of Senate and House to
support the shipping bill which
the administration proposes to
stand by to the limit at this session
of Congress, and talking with
these same men about pushing
legislation generally so that Con-j
gress may get through its labors
as early as possible.
Representatives Kitchin and V iizger- j
aid. who were not friends of the last !
shipping bill, and Senator Clarke of '
Arkansas, who bitterly fought the !
measure in the Senate, were personally 1
urged by the President to co-operate i
with the administration forces in j
shoving the measure along. Mr. Kitchin '
thinks he may be able to aid the Presi- j
dent; Mr. Fitzgerald, who has not read
the Alexander bill, which the administration
is supporting, says he cannot
say what he jvill do until he knows
what the bill contains, and Mr. Clarke
did not make any promise as to what
he will do.
Kitchin Again Sent For.
Majority Reader Kitchin. who talked
with th* President yesterday about a
tariff commission, was sent for today
and again discussed the legislative
status with him. Mr. Kitchin has assured
the President that the House will
not delay an early adjournment and
will soon get to work upon revenue
measures, a tariff commission, the appropriation
bills, the shipping bill,
Philippine independence and an antidumping
act. The President has been
led to expect long debates and delays
in the Senate over national defense,
shipping, tariff and revenue bills.
The conference with Mr. Kitchin especially
related to the shipping bill.
Mr. Kitchin, as majority leader, has
before him a copy of the Alexander bill <
and promised the President to study it
carefully. Mr. Alexander has alreadytalked
with Mr. Kitchin about the provisions
of the bill, and Mr. Kitchin is
expected to fall in line for the measure.
It is understood the bill will carry an
authorization for the expenditure of
between $40,000,000 and $.">0,000,000 for
the purchase of ships, a bond wssue to
furnish the money.
The fact that the President today
made personal appeals to leading democrats
to stand by the administration
on the shipping bill shows, it is said,
that he is going to shove the bill
along and try to obtain action upon it
before it gets clogged up in the final \
rush of* Congress and again relegated {
to the rear.
With Senator Simmons, who had been J
summoned for a conference, the President
discussed the shipping bill, the
proposed tariff bo-rd and the Philippines
bill, expressing the hope that
these might be gotten out of the way
as speedily as possible.
Clarke Refuses to Talk.
Senator Clarke of Arkansas, who opposed
the shipping bill last year, fighting
it hard, had half an hour's talk
with the President during which the
I'resident suggested that he would he
glad to see the Arkansas senator join
the supporters of the administration!
on this legislation. Mr. Clarke would
not talk about his visit on leaving the
White House.
The President is understood to have
pointed out to Senator Clarke and the
other callers that a number of the
features of the bill to which they have
heretofore objected have Urea eliminated.
notably government ownership,
alsc telling them that the administra
islation anil hopes that it may become
law through the united work of the
democratic forces in Congress.
Supreme Court Vacancy.
President Wilson and Attorney General
Gregory have had several conferences
recently about the vacancy in
the Supreme Court of the United States
and President Wilson is believed to be
nearly ready to make a nomination to
the Senate. In some quarters it was
thought the selection might be finally
made this afternoon or tonight, before
the departure of the President for
New Vork, but if this is not done the
nomination will go over until after the
return of the President from the west.
Frederick Lelimann of St. Louis, who
was solicitor general in the Tuft administration,
although a democrat, was i
today regarded as standing the best
chance of being selected unless the i
President at the last minute concludes!
to yield to the strong sentimental and ]
professional demand for William H. j
Taft. Friends of Mr. Taft, who is in j
no sense a candidate for the place, j
represent him as highly pleased with :
the expressions of friendship for him
that have been so widespread.
All the candidates are before the
President and delegations have ceased
to call at the White House in behalf
of favorite jurists and lawyers. In
other words, the President has heard
all that is to be said and his decision
is the last step.
Goes to New York Tonight.
president Wilson, who will have little
time around the White House from
now until February 4, worked hard
today to clear up pending work. Tonight
he leaves for New York to make
the first of his preparedness speeches
tomorrow. He will be in Washington
again rrmay. out umy iur a. snort time,
and will then depart for the west on
his first tour, taking in the states of
Pennsylvania, Ohio, Wisconsin, Illinois,
Iowa, Missouri and Kansas.
President Wilson decided today to
make brief platform speeches at YVaukegan.
111.: Kenosha. Wis.; Iowa City,
Iowa: Lawrence, Kan.; Racine, Wis.,
and East St. Eouis during his middle
western trip. He has been invited to
speak at many other towns along his
route, but acceptance depends upon the
train schedules. It was indicated that
while he will devote himself principally
to the preparedness issue, he will
also discuss other questions pending in

Speaker Not Strictly Parliamentary
in Discussing Those
"Presidential Bee" Stories.
* Au
Speaker Champ Clark is having- his th>
troubles these days, and in discussing st;
ihem the language he uses in private
conversation with his friends is far from ^
parliamentary. His tribulations began
several weeks ago, when somebody started W1
the story that he was in, or contemplating,
or negotiating an alliance with William J.
Bryan to wrest the presidential nomina
tion from President Wilson. WI
Speaker Clark wouldn't even dignify m<
that story with a denial. He said his to
attitude toward the nomination had been
publicly expressed, was well known, was
being borne out consistently by his pres- S
,eni. course in Congress, and would the it
perpetrators of the story please get to re<
thunder out of here, or words to that m?

Still Another Chapter. !ho
} en
Now comes along another chapter, to |
use the language of the poet, "still harp- 'm(
ing on my daughter." The public prints Ly.
reproduce a letter with this heading and cJe
opening paragraph: tJJ
"Champ Clark Presidential Campaign
Committee, 135 Broadway.
New York, December 29, 1915. _
| "Dear Sir: D
"In 1912 the Hon. Champ Clark was
robbed of the presidency through the
manipulations of unscrupulous politicians.
l,et 1916 repair the injury of the
1912 democratic convention. As a highly
principled man of character Presi- B<
dent Wilson must be constrained to refuse
renomination by reason of the "one
term' which was incorporated in the
I nlatform on which he came before the
American voters for their suffrage as a
candidate for the office he now occupies."
j
The letter then goes on to make a
; long argument in favor of nominating- va
j Champ Clark instead of Wood.ow Wil- co
son. It is signed by Julius J. Binder. vi<
Other names on the document are as f
follows: Philip Levy, vice chairman;
M. Crames, secretary; Michael H. Tro- vo
pauer, treasurer, and John Model, jr., ch
J. Davidson and Max Kramer, these
latter, with Mr. Binder, forming a
I finance committee. ha
ye
Addresses Looked Up. ol,
The New York Times looked up these I
addresses and reported that the city he
directory gives Mr. Levy as a clerk, gr
living at 71 West 116th street; Crames, ne
as a lawyer, of 105 East 97th street; of
Tropauer, a clerk, of 68 East 122d ex
street; Hodel, a cashier, and so many vh
Davidsons and Kramers are listed that
the particular ones could not be identi- pe
fled. None of these men could be fie
reached yesterday. sa
There was much speculation around
the Capitol today over the letter and
some of the Speaker's friends were in- PJ
clined to "Jolly" him on it, while the
Speaker seemed uncertain whether to be
be peeved over the sitution or to take it trj
all as a joke. j
Tiws Speaker's friends, in discussing Ia
k~ HPrlnunlv. declared that, as thev an
understood his position, it is that if
President Wilson wants the nomina- un
tion it is his, so far as Speaker Clark is th
concerned. If President Wilson, for I
any reason sufficient to himself, decides co
not to run, it will be time enough when an
such a decision is announced to talk
about a Clary boom. ^

BLOW DEBATE

IN BKII Ion HUUot
Expected to Bring to Head j
Bitter Controversy Over |
German Trade. I
GOVERNMENT'S ATTITUDE
IS NOT YET MADE CLEAR
Intimated Unofficially That Cabinet
Is Opposed to Declaring
Formal Blockade.
I-OX DOX, January 26. 1133
p.m.?Experts and self-styled experts
on the economics of war
and the law of maritime war on
commerce mobilized in the house
of commons this aftrnoon for the
eagerly awaited debate on the
measures to be taken for a blockade
against Germany.
There are intimations, unofficial
in nature, that the Rritish
government has decided against a_
formal blockade of German ports.
It is pointed out in English newspapers
which reflect the views of
(he government that such a block- !
? . . . .
ade might weaken Great Britain's ;
hands and increase friction with 1
neutrals.
Show Concern for Neutrals.
Critics of the government's policy and
he defenders thereof are equally insistent
on the necessity of enforcing
'a blockade as effective as possible,"
inji they join issue on the best method
of enforcing this, a keen desire being
ehow.i in some quarters to make the
nterference with neutral commerce a-; j
light as possible. j
The demand is general, however, for
i great stringency in the prevention of
foodstuffs and other conditional contraband
passing by neutral countries
into Germany.
Hinges on Formal Motion.
The debate hinges on a motion introduced
with the object of obtaining
from the government a full statement
the facts and giving an opportunity
to deal with most of the aspects of the ;
recent complaints against the foreign j
:>flice. The motion follows:
"That this house, having noted the '
volume of imports into neutral countries
bordering on enemy territory of
goods essential to the enemy for the
prosecution of the war, urges the government
to enforce as effective a blockuue
as possible without interfering
with the normal requirements of those '
neutral countries for internal con- '
sumption."
Attracts Wide Attention.
The debate in the house of commons is !
ittracting widespread attention, being ex
pected to bring to culmination the bitter
controversy which has been going on in i 1
he press relative to the strengthening of I4
he measures taken to restrict Germany's
'oreign trade.
Sir Edward Grey, the foreign secretary,
s expected to submit a statement. '
Some indication of the government's i

igures issued last night to controvert assertions
of certain newspapers that huge

FEARS FOR FUTURE VOICED

To Be "Hard and Bad World" for

the Present War Has
ueen Lnaea.
BRISTOL, Rngland, January
26, 1 :^o p.m.?The reptcsentatives
of more than 2.000.000 members
of trades unions met here
today to decide the attitude of
oiganized labor toward the war,
and. in particular, compulsory
military service.
The conference is regarded as
the most important of its kind
ever held in Kngland.
The session of the conference
will last three days, and it promises
to be a momentous one in
the annals of the movement.
Fate Depends on Labor.
The compulsory military service bill
having passed the house of commons
ind encountered little opposition in tli^
house of lords, the outcome of the Ion*
campaign on this issue will depend
largely on the attitude of organized
labor. / "
Although great opposition to compulsion
developed at the London labor
conference, it is believed this feeling
has died down to a considerable extent
since that time
Early in the proceedings an attack on
the compulsory service bill was made
by the president of the conference.
William Anderson, member of parliament
for the Attercliflfe division of
Sheffield. Mr. Anderson, who lias opposed
the bill in parliament, declared
that it did not redeem the pledge of
Premier Asquith regarding compulsion.
"No form of words can offer immunity
from danger," he said. "We cannot
have forced military service without
the risk of forced Industrial service.
An attempt to use this weapon to
coerce trades unionists will lead to
great bitterness and end In failure."
Mr. Anderson said there was danger
in Great Britain's "attempting the impossible"
by seeking to be simultaneously
a great naval, a great military
and a great industrial power. He ssid
the world would be different after the
war, adding: "It will be a hard and a
bad world for labor unless labor takes
a hand in shaping it."
Horrified by "Atrocities."
The first resolution was moved by
Tames Sexton, on behalf of the National
rinion of Dock Workers. Tha resolu
tion expresses "the horror of the conference
at the atrocities committed by
Germany and her allies," and pledges
the conference to assist the government
as far as possible to prosecute thenar
successfully.
Mr. Sexton said he was opposed to
militarism, but that the war must be
ivon.
"If Germany wins." he continued,
"nothing else on God's earth matters."
Ramsay MacDonald. labor member of
parliament, appealed for toleration. He
leprecated such a controversial resolution,
which, be said, was calculated
lo interfere with labor's previous com?i--u{n

adopted by a card vote of 1,302.000 ^
against 602,000.
Tension Among Delegates.
Tension among the delegates was evVlent
from the moment W. H. Avles, a
ocal labor leader. In welcoming the confess,
remarked that the memlxjrs of the
party in Bristol neither had the time nor
he inclination to engage in recruiting.
Mingled applause and dissent greeted
his remark, and the situation was furher
heated by John Hodge, member of
iarliament for the Gorton division of
Lancashire, who protested against this inroduction
of a debatable subject in the
>ffioial welcome.
The presidential address of Mr. Anferson
did little to allay the suspicions
>f those delegates who have been makng
a fight against compulsion.
"Militarism and democracy cannot
ive together in Germany or any.
I'hurp." was one of the presiding of
leer's opening; sentences and was much
ipplauded. .Mr. Anderson proceeded to
eniark: "There are signs of a grear
eaction in this country. Mr. Lloyd
Jeorge. who apparently would like to
;ee the rules of the army applied to
he workshops, made u not very successful
attempt by means of the muni*
ions act."
URMY COMPULSION BILL
IS UNOPPOSED IN LORDS
LONDON'. January 26.?The house of
ords without division passed the second
reading of the military service bill
esterday afternoon. .
The Archbishop of Canterbury, in the
ourse of the debate, bestowed a beneliction
on the measure, saying he. regarded
it as a plain, straightforward,
?"" nffnrt 1n mfft u situation ex

raordinarily difficult.
Earl Curzon, lord privy seal, in conluding
the debate, expressed the opinon
that the most serious critieisin of
he bill was made by those who conended
that it did not. go far enough.
Earl Derby, director of recruiting,
aid he was convinced that the bill
vhen imposed on the country would
lot make the disturbance in indusrial
circles that many had predicted,
le was more frightened by the extent
f the exemptions granted by the govrnment
than by the reduction in men
vallable for military service made by
he munitions tribunals.
