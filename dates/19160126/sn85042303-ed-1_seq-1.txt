COUNTY ATTORNEY AGREED TO
LET DEFENDANT OUT ON BOND
WHICH WILL NO DOUBT BE
MADE TODAY.
County attorney iias agreed to allow
W. I!. Slaughter, alleged kidnaper, bail
in the sum of S.",iiini, and as soon as
Mr. Slaughter arranges to furnish this
bond, he will waive preliminary hear
ing and be released until the regular
term of court.
Mr. Slaughter who is getting well
past the meridian of life, at one time
was worth over half a million dollars,
but the wreck of the Mercantile Na
tional Hank at Pueblo, Colorado, cost
him his fortune, and today lie con
fesses that he is practically broke.
The (Jakes family, paternal grand
parents of the child in question have
also suffered financial reverses, and
W. I. Cruce who has been retained as
attjrney for Mr. Slaughter, stated that
he was going to make a supreme effort
to get the two families to compromise
this matter, and not spend what little
they have remaining in court costs and
attorney's fees. Mr. Cruce is very
anxious to see the families reconciled,
lie is superintendent of the Presby
terian Sunday School here, and very
often takes his religion Into his prac
tice, lie thinks that there is a better
way to settle most difficulties than re
sorting to the law, and if he succeeds
in reconciling the two lamilies, lie will
have accomplished some rial practical
Christianity.
It is thought that Mr. Slaughter will
have no difficulty in making the neces
sary bond.

Local People Have Privilege
in Call for Help for Jews
The people of this section of the
country have an opportunity to ex
press their appreciation of the Jew
in the call made by President Wil
son designating January ;s as Jewish
Kelief Day in America.
The Jews in the war zone have
suffered frightfully. Thousands cf
their women and children will starv-
unless help comes from this country.
The Jews have been contributing to
the help of their people since th"
war began, but the funds which have
been received have not been sufficient
to meet the needs of the starving
hordes The local Jews contribute
every month to the relief fund.
There was never a call for help in
the nation, state or community that
the Jews did not contribute generous,
ly. They take care of their own peo
ple without outside help, and they
help all other nationalities in thiir
efforts to relieve want. The Jewish

as far as work is concerned, but In

and informations must he issued, and
the en-,-- i .-.Ken to the district court.
Some ef the "fraternity" have been
laboring under the delusion that when
they paid a line in city court, their
cases were settled. They are inclined
to be "Mire" ovi r the fact that they
paid the uu:i! hundred dollars which
is standard in city court, together
with a thirty-day sentence in the
city jail, in some cases, to find that
they will he brought into the district
court, where a "pen" sentence is
liable to be given.
Of the cases certified over lo the
county attorney, several are against
the same man, and lie will be com
pelled to do some tall scrapping to
get out of his predicament.
"You can say for me," said Mayor
Muller 'his morning, "that the bunch
of sports wlio were burned out at
Ragtown and came to this city to open
up will have some hard sledding.
There is no room for them here, and
th" first one who tried it landed in
jail before the doors were fairly open.
If they think they call pull any of the
oil field 'stunts' here, tlen- have .an
other guess mining, and my advice
to them would be to leave town and
try some other place, as there is
absolutely nothing here."
This statement is backed by rh'ef
Iluiehlns and his men. Tin y are fa

have returned since the fjr:. n the oil
field, and it, is going o he impo. dble
for them to do business here, with all

The J.-w is a good citizen wherever

that h' insists upon worshiping God

In America, where religion." fr?e

who always contributes liher.-lly to
every enterprise that goes toward
making a better country, and in char
ity the entire race Is warm-hearted
and liberal.
The people of Carter counv ought

that if we turn our backs upon the

Lightning's Freakish Work.
The sharp lightning which plaved
over this city for a few moments this
morning plaved a freakish trick at the
home of Haul Hane, on the corner of
i; street and Second avenue, north
west. Directly after the Hash, the escape
pipe from the hath room was found
to be a roaring torch, the sewer gas
having become ignited by the bolt.
The lire department was summoned
and the blaze extinguished before any
damage was done to the building.
The inmates of the house received a
gnat scare, however, as the roar from
the blazing-pipe was, for a time, deaf

ed in tue instant death of the latter in

l-'lolll eye Witnesses lo Die shooting
it wa . b-ar I that Arch Campbell en
tered tin- Palace barber shop and en
deavored to start trouble with some of
the workmen, when police officers
have Crazier and McCoy and deputy
sheriffs Hallow ami Williams and con
stable lleiisoti made an attempt to ap
prehend him. It is stated that lie
warned the officers not to enter and
began shooting at them. They all drew
guns and a I'usil.ide of builds fol
lowed. When it was over, It was
found that Campbell was dead and
Deputy Hallew was seriously wound
ed, a bullet entering his body near the
left shoulder and completely penetrat
ing his body.
Hallew was taken to the Hardy san
itarium for treatment and his wound
is considered dangerous.
No one seems to know what prompt
ed Campbell to begin shooting, lie was
a peaceful (dtlzen when not under the
influence of liquor, but It is alleged
that lie has been drinking heavily of
late, and was in had temper at the
time,
j The remains of Campbell were taken
to the undertaking establishment of T.
('. Hridgman to be prepared for burial.
Sheriff Ciiirrett examined the body and
slated that he was shot four times,
once through each arm and twice in
the head.
Immediately after the shooting an
immense crowd assembled and it was
necessary for the proprietor to close
the place and call the officers to dis
perse the crowd.
Workmen In the place state that
Campbell when he entered, went to
the rear of the simp and called for
them to come back there, but they,
noticing his condition told him that
they were busy, w in n he pulled his
gun and compelled compliance with
his demands. At this ti Frazier
started to enter the shop, when Camp
bell warned him not to do so, find
immediately began firing. The offi
cers who had received tiie warning en
tered from tie' front and rear entrance
and began filing with the above ro-
sult.
Dr. Hardy stated this afternoon that
iialleu was badly wounded, but unless
'unforeseen complications set in, he
would undoubtedly recover. This is
the second time within the past two
I mouths that Hallew has been w ounded
(while makii g an arrest. The first was
at Itagtown some time ago, when one
j man was killed while attempting to
hold up a restaurant.
Campbell has lived in this section of
j the state for many years and has
I many warm friends who were surpris
jed at his action as he was always con
sidered a very peaceful citizen.
The county officials are making a
thorough probe into the affair and w ill
i be in position to give out a statement
j tomorrow.

Is a sad page in the history of Ard

I was one of the best fellow s in the
j world. He entered the barber shop and
: first asked Dee Klllott to follow him
i to the rear. The barber replied that he
!was busy. He theu asked Joe Hucka
' by to come w ith him. Huckabay's re
! ply was "I have nothing on me." Camp
bell then drew a gun from his pocket,
.a new .4.) calibre Colts pistol. When.
Flliott and Huckahy saw the gun. they
told Campbell they would come and
started toward him. At that time Of
j licer Frazier appeared at the front
door, ami Campbell then turned his at
' tent ion to the officer, warning him not
to enter. This delay gave the barbers
'a chance to get out of the building, and
they did so.
