HLFFI TAKES
ACTION TO RELIEVE
Yuma. Ariz., Jan.. 2~.—Residents of
Yuma were joyous tonight over the
announcement that' the United States
senate had passed a resolution to
make available $50,000 for repair of
the government's levee in the Delia
river. It was this break which caus­
ed the flooding of Yuma Saturday.
The water arid electric light plants
have beerf repaired. A large num­
ber of homeless families still are be­
ing cared for. 'The Colorado river
was falling here and no further dan­
ger of flood was apparent.
BIG LOSS IN CALIFORNIA.

AS BOY WORKS IN
ST. PAUL PUNT
St. Paul, Mlinn., Jan. 25.—Last Sep­
tember, George Morgan went to work
at the plant of a local refrigerator
company. Today a young woman giv­
ing the name of Georgiana Morton,
and about 19 years old. appeared at
the cashier's office and asked for
'^George's wages," saying she had
worked for the company disguised as
a boy, but was now going to quit.
The girl is said by acquaintances to
hate "beaten" her way to St. Paul
from Milwaukee, about a year ago.
Fear of being exposed, it is believed,
prompted the girl to discontinue her
masquerade.
LUSITANIA MUST

Proposals for Settlement Just Tendered
Not Accepted by State Department
Notes to Be Exchanged Until
Agreement Is Reached.
Washington, Jan. 25.—The United
States is understood to have rejected
as being partially unsatisfactory Ger­
many's latest proposal iu the Lusi
tania negotiations.
Secretary Lansing, with the approv­
al of President Wilson, is said to
have so informed Count von Bern
storff, the German ambassador, dur­
ing a conference late today at. the
state department.
The ambassador will confer again
with the secretary tomorrow. It is
understood he will then submit an­
other confidential tentative proposal
for a settlement, having embodied in
it. the requirements of the United
States.
After being considered by the pres­
ident and Secretary Lansing, the mat­

BEFORE HOUSE
Indications Are the British 'Will
Strengthen Grip on Control
of Cargoes.
London, Jan. 25.—In anticipation of
tomorrow's important debate in the
house of commons on the blockade
Question, the British government to­
day issued a four-column statement,
and refuting statistics re
published itt the Morning' Post
and Daily Mail, concerning what
those newspapers have declared the
hugely increased imports into Scan­
dinavia and Holland since the begin­
ning of the war. Beyond this no at­
tempt has been made to draw any
conclusion from the figures given,
neither is there any change in the
government's policy. Despite every
expression of opinion on each side,
the government may decide to de­
clare an actual blockade, and it is
still regarded as possible that the
government may only intend to tight­
en the existing system of controlling
cargoes likely to reach countries at
war with the Entente powers.
May Oppose Action.
An effective blockade of Germany's
Baltic ports would eliminate the ob­
jections of the United States to the
present operations against British
orders-in-council, which are discrimin­
atory to Norway and Sweden.
Recognition of such a blockade,
however, would depend upon its act­
ual effectiveness, and officials here
indicate moreover that any whole­
sale destruction of merchant shipping
in attempting to effect a blockade
with submarines would meet with the
opposition of the United States, even
though very proper precautions were
taken to safeguard the lives of crews
and passengers.
THIRTY-THREE NIGHT
RIDERS HAVE PLEADED
GUILTY TO CHARGES
New Madrid, Mo., Jan. 25.—Thirty
three defendants in the night rider
trials here pleaded guilty today, thus
'bringing the trials to a sudden end.
All 33 were sentenced to six months'
imprisonment and then immediately
were paroled on good behavior. Two
men, who were on trial today, were
allowed to plead guilty and were pa­
roled with the rest.
The sentences of the Ii8 whose
cases had already ibeen disposed of
will stand unless the trial judge
should parole them.
Twelve of these pleaded guilty and
were sentenced to two years in the
penitentiary. Six went to trial, were
convicted and were sentenced to
terns varying from three to five
years.

Marblehead, Mass., Jan. 2f.—The

structed for aero marine service here

approval or disapproval of the ^Ger­
man government.
Five or six days may elapse* before
if is known whether the Berlin for­
eign office will assume a view which
coincides with that of the administra­
tion.
In many particulars, the suggested
form of agreement designed to con­
clude the controversy, which was sub­
mitted through the ambassador is ac­
ceptable.

Says He Fears England More
Than Germany After the
War.
Washington, Jan. '25—Unqualified
non-partisan support of military pre­
paredness was urged today by Min­
ority Leader Mann, in a ringing
speech, on-_ the floor, of .the hqjpgjofc
representatives. He was heartily
and repeatedly applauded by both
sides of the chamber.
While it has been understood that
most of the Republicans favored
army and navy increases, until today
none of their leaders had spoken on
the subject. Representative Mann
based his plea on the ground that it
behooves the United States now to"
prepare for any eventualities that
may come as a result of the Euro­
pean war.
"I have much more fear in the end
of war with England than I have of
war with Germany," he said. That
was his only comment on this phase
of the subject.
Later he declined to elaborate on
his remarks.
Mr. Mann urged no particular pre­
paredness plan. He said he favored
a standing army of 250,000 or 300,000
or half a million men, better coast de­
fenses and "a navy which will bo able
to defend us on the seas."

was stated, however,
that the United States insists on hold­
ing the German government to a
strict "accountability" for the losp of
more than 100 American lives, and
desires that the Berlin government
admit, in effect, that, it is liable, ac­
cording to law, for the lives of the
neutrals lost in the commission of an
act against a vessel of the enemy.

War Makes Necessary Steps to
Protect American In­
dustries.
Washington, Jan." ^. --Announce­
ment was made toniglii that President
Wilson favors the creation of an inde­
pendent non-partisan tariff commis­
sion with broad powers in investigate
tariff duties, the relations between in­
dustries at home and ubruad, and the
entire tariff and connni'ivinl machin­
ery of the world.
The president discussed his plans
at length today with Representative
Kitchin, chairman of tin- house ways
and means committee, md asked that
the committee consider it immediately
with the view to getting action dur­
ing' the present, session of congress.
Tomorrow he expects to lay the
matter before Senator Simmons,
chairman of the senate finance com­
mittee. Later he may address con­
gress on the subject, although tonight
it was said this was improbable.
Although the president, previously
has taken the position that the pow­
ers of a tariff commission already are
held by existing government bureaus,
he told Mi". Kitchin lie thought justi­
fied in pressing for creation of a sep­
arate commission at this time, be­
cause of unusual conditions existing
in the world and on account of the in­
terest the United Stales will have in
commercial adjustments after the
present upheaval.v
A new use of a tariff, commission
proposed by the president would be
-to discover .the, pc*«$.uUty.,ot, estab­
lishing new industries or developing
old ones, such as production of dye
stuffs by use of scientific and practi-.
cable methods. Particularly he would
have it assist in securing facts on
which any "dumping" of cheap for­
eign products on the American mar­
kets and the furthering of unfair com­
petition might be prevented.
OIL SEARCH RENEWED

Marmarth, X. D., Jan. 25.—The
Montana Petroleum company is still
drilling for oil in litis territory. iA
new derrick has been built at. Baker,
Mont., and a well several thousand
feet' deep will be sunk. The company
is encouraged by the striking of gas
at a depth of 600 feel and it will soon
begin operations at Marmarth. The
fact that the government has reserv­
ed the oil and gas rights on 4S9.000
acres in the territory tends to cor­
roborate the s'.atentenls of the geolo
gist that there is oil iu this field.

Says German Emperor Has Aged
Greatly in Past Eight Years
Hair Is White.
London, Jan. 25.—The Daily Mail's
correspondent, who arrived at Nish
January 18, describes what he saw ot
the German emperor at close range
on several occasions at Nish, and
what happened at the royal banquet
where the emperor was the guest of
King Ferdinand.
"1 was face to face with the emper­
or directly after I left the train,"
said the correspondent. "It was eight
years since I had last seen the em­
peror.
"What a change the emperor is
not' a tall man, as represented in his
photographs, and beside the great
massive figure of the hawk-nosed
Ferdinand, who has a curious duck­
like wabble, the great war lord seem­
ed almost diminutive. His hair is
white, although his mustache is sas
piciously dark. There was an ab­
sence of the old activity of gesture.
"He has greatly aged. He held in
his hand a handkerchief, which he
was perpetually using and 1 noticed
later at the banquet that he seems
to require it to use to assuage the
continual coughing. 'Certainly he
spent more time coughing than eat­
ing."
BY NEXT JUKE
Washington, Jan. 25.—Agitation for
greater congressional activity on the
administration's legislative problems

President Wilson asked .Majority
Leader Major Kitchin to "speed up"

ments for discussing the subject with
other leaders of both houses tomor­
row. The president is anxious that
congress finish its work and adjourn

tions.
THEM TRIES DIETZ'S
PLAN OF DEFENSE
Barron, Wis., Jan. 25.—Wenzel Bar
anek, alleged slayer of Sheriff Matt
Olson, and who barricaded himself
and family in his barn, declaring he
would kill anyone attempting to ar­
rest him, late today surrendered
when apprised over a telephone that
to offer resistance to an armed posse
would probably result in the killing
of himself and wife.
An armed mob is reported to be­
coming from Prairie Farm, Olson's
former home, for the purpose of
lynching Baranek. Army guards are
patroling the vicinity of the jail.
Feeling against Baranek runs high.
The situation appears critical. Bara­
nek was accused of the theft of a
coat Sheriff Olson, with Deputy
Steve Hulbert, attempted to enter
Baranek's barn to search for the coat.
Baranek opened lire with a riflle from
his house and Olson fell with a bul­
let through his heart.
Hulbert escaped unhurt and re­
turned to Barron and organized a
posse of 150 armed men.
