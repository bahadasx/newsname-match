Hopcwell Workmen to t>o to
Kingsport.
The great Eederal Dye Works
of the Dul'onta at Kingsport
will comprise'*twelve units of
twelve buildings each, when
present building operations are
completed, according to a local
merchant largely interested in
Kingsport.
The latest move of the Du
1'ont Company is. to transfer
several hundred workmen from
the munition plants of Hope
well to the dye works at Kings
port, as it was found impossible
to keep the force of workers up
to the required number by local
recruiting.
There is a well-founded rumor
that a large cotton manufactur?
ing plant will bo founded at
Kingsport in the near future?

Washington, I). C, Jail. 18.?
A very interesting hill, which
has been introduced by Coli?
gross C. Itasconi Slenip, pro?
vides that the Ullitcil States
shall pay to the heirs of former
Congressman Daniel II. I logo j
of .Montgomery county. $10,
000 salary ami mileage, for his
services as a Congressman
from is'.', to 1807.
The United States Congress
at that time refused to allow
lioge to take his seat on the
ground that Virginia had seced?
ed ami was no longer it purl of
the union.
Mr. Sleiup contends that l.loge
should have been admitted,
in as much as it has beeil held
since (he war that Virginia
never was out of the union at
all, but only attempted to gel
out. lie claims thtit the union
has never been broken.
S. 11 arris I luge, a son of Dim
iel II. Ilbge, is living in
ltoanoke now, ami im has other
relatives scattered all over the
counties of Southwest Virginia.
"In my judgment, this is a
Vor) worthy ease, I hope Coll
gross will take that view of the
question," said M ?. Slemp to
day in speaking of his hill.

London, Jan. 21.?Germany's
campaign in Kgypt is meeting
with obstacles, it is announced
here, due to the luck of coal to
operate the railroad which Ger?
mans have constructed south?
ward through Syria to the edge
of the desert approaching Sue/,
canal. The absence of coal pre?
vents the actual opening of the
road to transportation.
This lack of coal has led the
Germans to reopen the old T?r
kisdi mines in Syria used by the
Kornaus, but abandoned by
them a thousand years ago. A
large force of Turkish laborers
is working the mines.
