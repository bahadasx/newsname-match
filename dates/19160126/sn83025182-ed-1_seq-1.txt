submitted the written proposals set

position o£ the United States govern

Illegality of the sinking of the Lusi

American lives.
Arrangements were made that Am

communication to his government im

done until Berlin is heard from.
The German ambassador carried no
communication with him when he
went Into Secretary Lansing's office.
He had in his hand a card on which
were written a few notes, presum
ably suggestions to Incorporate into
the memorandum to be Sent to Ber

After his conference with Secretary
Lansing, the ambassador dictated a
message to a state department stenog

code message to Berlin containing the
United States government's proposals.
Count Von Bernstorff was closeted
with the secretary for about thirty

LONDON, Jan. 26.—Th« British
government has virtually decided to
stand pat on Its present trade regula
tions and will make no npouncement
of a blockade of the German
coast in parllmeijt th' .ernoon, the
majority of well Inf' ^.d parliamen
tary writers agreed £*ay. Only a
few papers clung belief that the
cabinet will annoi' a a radical change
of policy. The ^Virown about Ger
many by the ey^ ®.g regulations may
be tightened 1' »rae respects, but It
wss the genec iellef of the newspa
pers that the»ablnet haa decided
against any revolutionary change In
policy. The storm of protest raised
In the United Statea and In Sweden,
some of the papera broadly hinted,
has cooled the ardor of advocates of
the blockade If It has not hpd Its ef
fect upon the government. The news
papers gave prominent display to the
warlike utterances of Che Swedish
premier in his Riksdag speech yester
day and the Dally Telegraph and the
Dally News cautioned the government
against any action likely to Involve
Great Britain with neutrtila.
"The firebrand* of the press have
demanded that we brush neutrals out
of our psth with a strong hand, but
what would be the position of the en
tente allies If the vast resources, of
the United Statea ceased to be at
their eomnianrd?" demanded the .News.
"There is reason to believe that
the foreign aecretary will announce
thla afternoon that the government
has reached no Important declaion
with reference to the foiindatlona of
our policy," said the Telegraph.
"This country may be content with
the present measures, which if appar
ently slow, are sure, and which -hith
erto have been adopted without any
severance of friendly relations with
the neutral powers. We have had ex
periencea of the past consequences of
Imperious and overbearing conduct."
Formal debate on the blockade Is
sue w*f expected to open wJ.yj. tluM«-

such a drastic step by Arthur Shirley
Benn, a conservative. Sir Edward
Grey was counted upon to snswer for
the government with a sweeping de
nial of the charge that the present
"blockade" had been Ineffective.
Bitter debate was expected, the
blockade advocates again assailing the
government with chargea of unwilling
ness to taks strong, aggressive action.
