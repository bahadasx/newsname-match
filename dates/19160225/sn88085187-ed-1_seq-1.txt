CORNER BANDITS IN SEATTLE!
HIP, HIP!
BUSTLE'S
COMING!
By Edgar C. Wheeler
"I understand," remarked my
wife, "that bustles are coming in
igain."
"The Fiji Islanders are wear
ng rings In their noses," 1 eoun
"l must get one," said my wife.
"A ring?"
I "No, stupid. A bustle."
"Woman," said 1 sternly, "if
do I shall not divorce you.
Instead, 1 shall wear one of those
green coats the designers of men's
fashions are talking about —the
kind with flaring skirts draped
over the hips."
She paled at that.
"It won't be a very big bustle,"
'she said. "One must be in l'a.U
--1 ion."
. . .
Yes, bustles are coming in
again.
Dear, dear, how the thought of
them rfiakes my thoughts gallop
over the back trail of the years'
Back In the '80s my sreat
aunt and sisters and all their
■women friends wore bustles. I
remember one woman, a friend
of my great aunt's, who was so
generously endowed with fleshly
curves that she really didn't need
't bustle.
But she super-Imposed) a
rout rapt lon of wire anyhow
—"one must lie in fashion"
—nnd every time she turned
around in a room, her rear
elevation knocked over tlie
tables and chairs. |
4 . *
N We used to say that bustles
'served no useful purpose
It isu't true.
I have a great-uncle who is n
retired army officer. During the
bustle period my great-uncle and
his wife were going from one
army post In the Dakotas to an
other, with a small escort of sol
diers, when they were attacked
by Indians.
Tlie redinen captured and loot
ed the wagons, but the whites es
caped with their lives.
My great-uncle and his wife
lost all their baggage, which iu
cluded a yellow satin ball dress
and a hustle.
* Years later by great-uncle was
visiting a reservation when 'ie
met an old squaw. She was wear
ing the yellow satin ball dress,
now very ragged and dirty.
She carried a pappoose on her
back. The pappoose was In a
basket. And the bottom of the
basket rested on my great-aunt's
bustle.
It took the strain off the
squaw's shoulder blades!
* t *
Then, too, I had a boy chum
who made excellent use of his
mother's bustle which he borrow
ed without leave. He had been
reported for truancy from school.
"My son," said his father, "this
hurts me more than It does you."
* It did, too. Thanks to the ous
tle, my chum told me, it didn't
hurt him at all.
■ • •
There is one thing to be said
In favor of bustles.
They are not pretty and they
are not, as bustles, utilitarian.
But they are not necessarily
expensive.
Any old thing that will make a
woman stick out behind is a
bustle.
An old-fashioned wire rat trap
makes a fine bustle. The kitchen
mop can be made to serve as one.
Or a sofa pillow.
Just why women should
•want to stick out behind la
neither here nor there.
For that matter, I don't
know why they once wanted
to wear hoop skirts.
Or, much mi— recently,
they wore their skirt* no
tight they couldn't navigate,
and then slit them to the
knees so tltey could.
Nor do I know what pleasure
the Fiji islanders find in wear
ing rings In their noses.
Or why la-de-da boys wear
monocles. Or green coats.

NOBODY HOME!
In Mason Library—Whose Job
Is It to Dust the Shelves?
A high clan picture of nothing at all:
A perfectly good library building empty and
going to waste; hundreds of perfectly intelligent
North End families starving hungry for books
and a place to get them; the North Bod in need
of an assembly hall; the city and the library
board in a dead-lock, and stubborn "city fath
ers" announcing in passive contentment:
"Let George do it."
The library is there to be occupied, the gift of
un old-time Tacoman, Allan 0. Mason, and the
city has been pledged to keep it up to snnff for
library purposes.
"Fine," say the mayor and city council.
"We'll show our generosity by bequeathing it to
the library board. Great public spirit. Only we
won't fix it up and put it in repair."
Hack comes the library board and refuses the
gift unless it is put in working order. With a
chopped budget the board hasn't the money.
Jt needs all the available funds to handle its
rapidly increasing circulation with the limited
supply of funds on hand.
It refuses to start a new branch library unless
that library fc: equipped to serve the public,
What "VVli it worth college did do or didn't do
to the old Mason library doesn't cut any ice here.
The fact remains that there is a library build
ing and that the public is entitled to the benefit
of it.
By all the rules, the city is pledged to turn it
over to the public in tip top shape.
Well, whatcha going to do about it?
