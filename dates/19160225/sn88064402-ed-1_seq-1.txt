The Democratic Platform.
Lake Charles Press:
The American-Press believes that the
Democra:ic State Central Committee
took a forw1rd step Wednesday when it
Iadopted the declaration of principles
I which is to guide the Legislature in its
deliberations. We admit that the fram
ing of a platform does not properly be
long to the party comlnittee; its duties
are merely executive; Properly a plat
form should be constructed by a party
convention called for that purpose long
before the primary is held and the can
didates are nominated. But it is in
finitely better for a state central com
mittee to formulate such !a declaration
than for the members of the Legisla
ture to enter upon their duties un
pledged to anything and responsible to
nobody, as has been the case in Louisi-,
ana for twelve years or more, and
guided only by the personal wishes of
the governor, which they may discard
or adopt as they please.

The Parish' House, residence of the
Rev. Father J. P. Ferret, is being treat.
ed to a fresh coat of paint and other
wise being repaired and beautified this
week. The activity and industry of
Father Ferret is very much manifest
in the attractive appearance of the
church, the residence and surrounding
grounds, much of which has come
about by the fruit of his own toil. An.
other great improvement to the civic
appearance of Welsh in which Father
Ferret shares interest with the Catho.
hec Ladies Cemetery Society is the
beautifying of the Catholic Cemetery.
While this work was only begun last
year, the plot having previously re
ceived little care, the elfect is very
noticiable, and the same effort expend.
ed this year should make it an attrac
tive place.
