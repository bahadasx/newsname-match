a theme realistic and tffeotive.
As the nucleus for tbe msjor plot is
given a man, Newbold, who when his

her at her own request. Later the
dead woman's husband becomes pas

MORE MONEY FOR PENSIONS 5
Over $2,500,000 Annually Added to the
Rolls
Washington, D. O., Feb. 25r—Two
pension bills passed the house, pro
posing in all the addition of more than
$2,500,000 annually to pension expen
ditures. 7
One would grant pensions to the
widows and minor obildren of officers
and enlisted men who served ninety
days or more in the army, navy or

tbe war with Spain or the Philippine
insurreotlon between April 21, 1898,

is that there will be 10,000 claims un
der this measure requiring $l,500,0004the
first year, with a slight increase eaoh
year for come years.
Tbe other bill would give 120 a
month to survivors of Indian wars

ninety days or more in an aotual cam
paign, and who are 62 yeare old or over

With tbe expiration of Register J. L.

shown by a Watertown dispatch under
