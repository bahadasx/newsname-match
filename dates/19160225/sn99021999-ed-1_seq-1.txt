SOCIETY NIGHT
ACTS AS MAGNET
FOR AOTO SHOW
Big: Auditorium it Crowded with
Society Folk. Who Turn Out in
Large Numbers to See
Enormous Display.
EVENING DRESS IN ORDER
Visitors, Factory Men and Many of
Local Dealers Don Conventional
Black for the Occasion.
MANY WOMEN IN ATTENDANCE
It wm society night at the eleventh
annual Omaha motor exposition last
night. And It was society night not
only In nam but In fact. If there
were any other social functions last
night they must have been dull and
dismal failures. For the huge mu
nicipal Auditorium was crowded
until It seemed not another person
could force an entrance.
The admission last night was ad
vanced from the usual price of 35
cents to 75 cents. But the increased
tax was responsible for no hesitancy
in attending the show. In fact it
seemed as If the Increase accelerated
interest in the show and Inspired an
eagerness to attend on society night.
Evening clothes were strictly in order.
They even seemed in the majority. Many
of the dealers and salesmen were attired
In the conventional black apropos of
formal occasions. Others more of a turn
of mind to scorn the conventionalities
were content to make their appearance In
usual business attire. Belling an auto-
oblle while "dolled up In a bunch of
well duds'' was regarded as Incongruous
by some of the local men and they re
fused to wear their evening clothes.
we're here for business." they protested.
"not to make an exhibition of swell
cenery."
Factory Hts Not Backward.
But the factory men were In an entirely
different mood and they made up for all
deficiencies of the local men. They came
prepared for society night, bad their pot
clawhamtnera with them and had been
waiting In expectancy all week for the
big night. They were right on the Job
with the latest models of the fashioner's
art and observing Omaha young men
picked up a few new Ideas In evening
clothes' designs.
Flowers were profusely scattered about
the- Auditorium last night in observance
of tha oecaslon. In the cars, around tha

pagoda-like towers, around the light,
along the balcony wall and even on the

The feminine contingent was well rep
resented last night, too. There was al
most a many "women present as there
was men. They took a lively Interest In
the displays and they asked Just as many

Might Be Easy Victim for

Crozier Says Heaviest of New Forti

FINE SPOT FOR LANDING TROOPS
WASH1NUTON, Feb. 24. While
the huse military committee was tak
ing steps today toward netting its
bill for increasing the, regular army
and federalizing the National Guard
before the house within ten days, the
naval committee was being Informed
by Admfral Cameron Melt. Winslow
that the entire Pacific fleet, which
he commands, might be an easy vic
tim for a single good enemy battle
ship.
Admiral Winslow made the state
ment smilingly. Pressed by Repre
sentative Stephens of California for
an exact description of the conditln
of the ships under his command he
said the force was wholly Inadequate,
even with all its reserves called out,
to meet any probable enemy in the
Pacific. What plans the Navy de
partment had for meeting an emerg
ency there or in the Atlantic, how
ever, he said were matters of strat
egy which he did not care to reveal
except in confidential session.
More questions to Aak.
Representative Stephens agreed that
this discussion should be postponed, but
said he had many questions still to ask
regarding the Pacific fleet. He will pur
sue the subject tomorrow.
The military committee Is making rapid
progress In considering the bill which
Chairman Hay was authorised to frame
and which now has been printed confi
dentially. It Is expected this draft will
be made public this week and that It
will be favorably reported to the house
some time next week. It Is hoped to
have Its consideration by the house fixed
to follow the Immigration bill. The com
mittee Is sitting all day at its task, and
perfecting the measure, and It was sug
gested today that night sessions might
be started to hasten the work.
Further light on the War department's
plan for additional coast defenses also
was explained today when testimony of
Brigadier General William Crosier, chief
of army., ncduonce.betore the fortifica
tions committee became available." The
committee has had no open hearings.
Amplified Foslttoa.
While General Crosier told the military
committees of both houses the substance
of his recommendations, his statements
before the fortifications committee am
plified his position somewhat.
The heaviest new fortifications. Gen
eral Crosier said, will be placed at the
mouth of Chesapeake bay, which he de
scribed as one of several places where
"facilities for land operations are so good
that it is worth while to especially fortify
them to prevent that operation, notwith
standing that they are not places where
inadmissible damage can be done by the
guns of a fleet." At other points, such
a Rockaway Beach, ' X. Y.. and San
Francisco, he said 16-Inch guns mounted
in turrets would be added to the bat
teries. .
Settlement of the
Sioux City Strike
Seems Probable
SIOUX CITT, la., Feb. 24. Early today

tlement of the strike In the Sioux City
packing houses. Involving 2.300 employes.
Representatives of the strikers probably
will confer with packing house officials
this morning. Both sldea seem anxious
to end the strike.

ATTACK WAR TRAIN
IN TACOMA YARDS
.
Austrians Cut Air Hose Between
Cars of Freight Bearing Sup
plies for Allies.
CREW FIGHTS THE MEN OFF
TACOMA, Wash., Feb. 24. Boldly
attacking a Great Northern freight
train loaded with automobiles and
war supplies for shipment to Russia
from Seattle, in the Nrthern Pacific
freight yards near the Union station,
Tacoma, today, six or eight men cut
the air hose between cars in five
places, and cut the train In four sec
tions. The train crew, led by Con
ductor McLoughlin, fought them off
in a rugh-und-tuinble battle and rtrp-
tureod two who. gave the names of
Sam Husky and John Ross and their
nationality as Austrian. They were
held. .
Conductor McLouglilin said that while
the train stood in the yard a little group
of men tried to secrete themselves
aboard. The crew drove them away two
or three times. Just as the train was to
pull out, the concerted attack was made.
Great Northern freight officers in Ta
coma said it was known that the train
carried a car or two of automobiles for
shipment to Ruaila for war use and other
export goods, probably for war use, sent
from the esst. The Northern Paclflo
train dispatcher here raid that the train
had been routed around by way of Port
land from Spokane, and through Van
couver, Wash., probably to avoid going
over the mountains under present snow
conditions.
