In Note to Senator Stone, He Says,"The
Honor and Self Respect of the Nation
Is Involved Is Confident His Policy
Will Be Successful in Solving
Question of Sea Warfare.
PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE WILL
BE REPEATED TO LEADERS
Washington, Fd). 24—President Wilson, at the end of two clays
of agitation in Congress, for some action warning Americans off
armed merchant ships of European beligcrents, tonight wrote
Senator Stone, of the Foreign Relations committee, that he
could not consent to 'any abridgment, of the rights of American
citizens in any respect.
"The honor and self-respect of the nation is involved," ho
naid. "We covet peace, and shall preserve it at any cost, but the
the loss of honor."
Makes Views Clear.
The president expressed hope that
explanations of the declared inten­
tions of the central European powers
to sink all armed merchant ships
without warning would put a differ­
ent aspect on a situation which now
seems to present unsuperable obsta­
cles.
"We have had no reason to ques­
tion their good faith or fidelity to
their promises in the past," he added,
"and 1 for one feel confident we shall
have none in the future."
the letter was in answer to one
written late fills afternoon by Sena­
tor Stone, outlining the situation ex­
isting at l'ie capitol, where since
yesterday morning persistent de­
mands had been made for some ac­
tion which might lessen the possi­
bility of war between the United
States arid Germany.
The president's statement will be
repeated tomorrow morning to
Speaker Clarke, Representative
Kitchin, majority leader, and Repre­
sentative Flood, chairman of the
hoiiRe foreign affairs committee, who
late today asked for an engagement
in order to explain the position in
which the house found .itself and
asked ihe president for a statement
of Ihe administration's views.
Does Not Want War.
In his letter, the president said:
"I will do everything in my power to
keep the United .States out of war,"
continuing in pari:
"I think the country will feel no
uneasiness about my course in that
respect. Through mar.y Anxious
months I .have striven for that ob­
ject, amidst difficulties more mani­
fold than can have been apparent
upon the surface and so far I have
succeeded. 1 do not doubt that I
shall continue to succeed.
"But in any event our duty is clear.
No nation or group of nations has
the right while tbe war is in progFess
to alter or disregard the principles
which all nations have agreed upon
in mitigation of tbe, horrors and suf­
ferings of war and" if the clear
rights of American citizens should
ever unhappily be abridged or denied,
by any such actions, we should, it
seems to me, have In no'nor no choice
as to whait our own course shoiilu be.
"It is important ^to reflect that if
in this instance we allowed expedi­
ency to take the place of principle,
the door would be inevitably open to
still further concession.
Will Lose Potency.
"What we are contending for in
this matter is of the very essence of
the things that have made America
a sovereign nation. She cannot yield,
then without conceding her impo
tency as a nation, and making vital
surrender c£ her lnuependent posi­
tion among the nations of the world."
The president wrote his letter dur­
ing the afternoon, shutting himself up
in his study. His decision was to
end all speculation over what the
position of tne government was.
At tbe state department today it
was statSd that in its international
aspect, the situation had not changed
in the slightest degree for three or
four days. Officials said nothing had
been heard from Germany, in re­
sponse to the request of the United
States for assurances that previous
pledges made in the Lusitania and
Arabic negotiations would not be nul­
lified byvthe campaign against armed
ships.
Today's developments in congress
showed the administration leaders
holding their lines against any such
action as the president opposes. A
canvass of the senate disclosed sen­
timents in favor of President Wil­
son's proposition oominating.
Ma/ Warn Americans.
In the senate, Senator Gore made
an unsuccessful effort to introduce a
concurrent resolution expressing the
sentiment of congress that Ameri­
cans should keep oft armed ships and
also a bill requiring Americans in
procuring passports to take oath that
they would not travel on such ships.
Tonight, Senator Gore said he would
ask tomorrow that the concurrent
resolution lie on the table for a day.
On the WSuse side. Representative

Contemplated Action by Presi­
dent Wilson Given as Reason
for Slump.
ALL SMALL GRAINS
SUFFER BIG DECLINE
Chicago, Feb. H24.—RvariSrs^ that
Ambassador von Bernstorff was about
to be handed his passports smashed
down the prices of wheat today 7Vt
cents a liushel. In the collapse,
wjiieh was from an early advance,
the M^y option fell from $1.24 VI to
$1.17. The close was excited, 5 to
5% cents under yesterday's finish,
with May at $1.17%' and July at
$1.14%. Other leading staples, too,
all showed a deciiiled setback—corn
1%' to 1% to 1% cents: oats 2 cents,
and provisions 12% to 25 cents.
Almost a Panic.
Conditions that bordereil on panic
ruled in the wheat pit just before the
end of the session. Flurried holders
were tumbling over ea^i other in a
rush to stop huge losses, which with
unusual suddenness had resulted al­
most entirely from unverified reports
that drastic action was imminent on
the part of President Wilson in re­
gard to German plans for attacks by
submarines.
ONE GOOD BATTLESHIP
TROY FLEET
Admiral Winslow Tells the Naval
Committee Pacific Fleet Is
Useless.
•Wshington, Feb. 24.—While the
house militry committee was taking
steps today toward getting its bill for
increasing the regular army and fed­
eralizing the National Guard before
the house within ten days, the naval
committee was being informed by Ad­
miral Cameron R. Winslow, that the
entire Pacific fleet, which he com­
mands, might be an easy victim for a
single good enemy battleship.
'Pressed by Representative Ste­
phens of California for an exact de­
scription of the ships under his com­
mand, Admiral Winslow said the force
was wholly inadequate to meet any
probable enemy in the Pacific. What
plans the navy department has for
meeting an emergency there, or in
the Atlantic, however, he said, were
matters of strategy, which he did not
care to reveal except in confidential
session.
The military committee is making
rapid progress in considering the bill
Chairman Hay was authorized to
frame and which now has been print­
ed confidentially. It is expected this
draft will be made public this week.

Back in the Caucusus
Region.
London, Feb. 24.—Inspired by the
presence of their emperor and led by
Crown Prinz (Frederick William, the
German troops are engaged in one
of the greatest battles of the war on
the western front, centering around
the fortress of Verdun. Attack has
followed attack against the French
line, after bombardments, incessant
and terrific, continuing for several
days.
AVhile the Germans have not been
able despite the rain of shells and
furious onslaughts by the infantry, to
break the French lines, nevertheless,
the French on their right and left
wings have been compelled to with­
draw their lines, respectively to the
south of Ornes, and behind the town
of Sanogneux, six miles north of the
fortress.
Germans Force Fighting.
Only between Malanoourt and the
left bank of the Muese has there
been any diminution in the intensity
of the artillery fire. With Brabant
Haumont and Samogneux, aitfl the
wooded sections north and northeast
of Beaumont in their possession, the
Germans.from the Meuse eastward to
Fromezey, forcing the fighting, seem
ingl.v: regardless of the cost of life.
The French guns have answered
the German guns shell for shell, and
the casualties 011 both sides are very
great. The French official report de­
scribes the battlefield between the
Muese. and Ornes us pilot) wlrli O'er

On the Russian front, from tho
Riga region to East Galicia, there
have been engagements at various
points, but no great results have
been obtaih^cl by either side. In the
Caucasus, the, Russians report con­
tinued successes in pressing back
the Turks. The, usual activity by
•the Austrians and Italians on, the
Italian front continues.
Von Pohl Dead.
Admiral von Pohl, whose retire­
ment because of ill health from the
position of commander of the Ger­
man battle fleet was announced two
days ago, died in Berlin. Von Pohl
was born in Breslau, August 25, 1865.
He received a commission as lieuten­
ant when 21 years old.
Mauretania Released.
The government has decided that
the Cunard liner Mauretania can be
released from hospital duty and re
turned tp her owners. This state­
ment was made in the house of com­
mons today. The vessel v|jll return
to the Atlantic service.
Interest in Battle.
The great Verdun battle, which is
being watched in England with keen
interest, is regarded here as the long
expected big Cerman spring offens­
ive. It is pointed out that the
French, profiting by their earlier ex­
periences in the war, now rarely
hold their advance trenches strong­
ly, and that, therefore, their with­
drawal at some points to the second
line is no sign of weakness.
On the other hand, it is believed the
Germans generally are pursuing the
tactics of allowing the enemy to as­
sault in masses which involve enor­
mous sacrifices io the Germans.

Portugal
Seizes 36
Vessels
Lisbon, Portugal, Feb. 24.—The of­
ficial Gazette publishes the decree,
under which lili German and Austrian
merchant ships, lying in the Tagus
river, were seized by the commander
of the naval division here yesterday.
It appears that the seizure was un­
der a law passed by parliament on
February 7. The premier, in an in­
terview, affirms that the seizure is
not an act of war, but simply a mea­
sure in the public interest.
The Portuguese minister in Berlin
has been instructed to explain to the
German government the significance
of the seizure, and give assurances
that the rights of the owners will be
respected.
Portuguese crews have been placed
on board the ships seized.

Hoboken, N. J., Feb. 24.—Governor
L. B. Hanna arrived on the Nieuw

President Hansel of Fargo college.
The boat was delayed three days in
England.
"My, but I'm glad to get back," he
said. "I feel iirst rate now, but 1 had
a close call. I will rest a few days
in New York, but I want to get back
home as soon as 1 can.
"The war will last a long time. 1
do not look for an early peace. We
found Norway very busy but the cost
of neutrality is very great to their
government. I do not c*«e to com­
ment now on the Ford peace party
and of course, 1 know nothing of po­

Governor Hanna will leave for
North Dakota Sunday.
Eight more delegates who went to
Europe as members of the Henry
Ford peace expedition last December,
arrived today on the Hollat|l Ameri­
can liner Nieuw Amsterdam. Mr. Ford
went down the bay on a cutter and
met the ship at quarantine. Gaston
Plantiff, his business representative,
after Mr. Ford himself left the party
to return to America, stated today
that the expedition had thus far cost
his employer $400,000 and that his
peace efforts are to be continued
through delegates who remained in
Europe.
Jones Makes Statement.
A statement issued by Dr. Jenkins
Lloyd Jones of Chicago, one of the
returning delegates, said that while
members of the party "admitted the
crudities and incoherences" of the
experiment, because "the company
was hastily gathered and therefore
poorly organized," yet a very definite
impression was made in gt least four
of the neutral countries, a wide dis­
cussion of the principles of peace
heing promoted, pacifists everywhere
stimulated, and "cheer and hogelul
ness carried to the men in the
trenches."

President Young Talkif
President C. L. Young, who acted
as chairman, in an interesting
and inspiring address, traced tbe
library movement from 'the flwt
application for a Carnegie appropri­
ation, made by iMayor F. H. Register
in 1901 down through the yean in
which the Civic league, under' tbe di­
rection of .Mrs. C. tM. 'Dahl, was prac­
tically the only force in the capital
city"which kept tbe effort*alivef down
to the time, less thaa.^ jeajuago*
when the Commercial club took- up
the effort, interesting the city com­
mission in Bismarck's need of a pub­
lic library, and finally to the crown­
ing of the city commission's campaign
with success, when Secretary Ber­
tram of the Carnegie Corporation of
New York advised 'President Lucas
a few weeks ago that an appropria­
tion of $25,000 will be available for a
library when the latter shall have
been regularly established.
Mr. Young laid particular empbasis
upon the loyalty of the Civic league
to tbe library cause, telling of the
splendid work done by the ladies of
this organization in keeping tbe spir­
it alive, and, within the past few
weeks, in conducting a city-wide can­
vass for books, which netted more
than 1,500 volumes. Mr. Young told
of the work which has been done bjr
Mrs. iMinnie C. Budlong, secretary of
the iNorth. Dakota Public 'Library
commission Miss McPhee of the
slate library, iMiss Carpenter of the
state historical library and the 20,
public-spirited Bismarck women who
assisted in the trying work of index­
ing and cataloguing all of these books.
The speaker referred to the estab­
lishment of the temporary library by
the Commercial club and the setting
aside of a room in the club headquar­
ters for this purpose.
The Future.
The Commercial club library is, at
best, however, a makeshift, said Mr.
Young. The club has temporarily
surrendered space which it cannot
well spare executives are working in
cramped, inadequate quarters, in or­
der that a beginning may. be made in
the matter of a public library. This
reading room will not be permanent
the club cannot afford to maintain it,
and until a library is formally estab­
lished, by a vote of the IBismarek peo­
ple, there will be no funds for the
maintenance of a library anywhere*
The Carnegie Corporation offers
Bismarck $25,000 for the erection and
equipment of a library building. All
that is asked of Bismarck in return is
that this library be maintained, and
for this purpose a fund of 12,600 is
specified. Mts. Budlong, secretary of
the North (Dakota Public Library com­
mission, said Mr. Young, is authority
for the statement that no library
worthy of the name can he suitably
maintained for less than $2,500.
To establish a library ajfed- to pro*
vide this minimum sum for its main­
tenance is the purpose of next Mon­
day's election, stated President
Young. Should the proposition be re­
jected at the polls next Monday, Bis­
marck will be left in the same posi­
tion it has occupied, the unenviable
one of a city of 7,000 without a li­
brary it will have on ltd hands the
equipment of a .temporary library,
with no quarters in which to house
it, and with no funds with which to
maintain it.
The speaker described the modus
operandi, as follows: If a majority
of the electors vote next Monday to
establish a public libraiy ia Bismarck,
the city commission will appropriate
for the maintenance of the fnetttn
tion, but it will have notfcfaf la do
with the selection of a site or witk
expending the money so appropriated.
