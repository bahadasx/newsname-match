A BIG MONEY
SAVING SALE!
Having sold our Clothing Business to Greguson & Ringheim of our city, who who will take charge April 1, 1916, we have obligated ourselv&ssby
contract to reduce our stock to a certain figure. We are therefore compelled to slaughter our goods regardless of cost
for the next six weeks in order to reduce stock to the figure designated in the contract. This is a
splendid opportunity to buy well known and dependably merchandise below market value

This is bona fide sale and the Big Reduction in prices has been necessitated by the fact that we have obligated ourselves
to reduce the stock to a certain figure by April 1st, 1916, and therefore must make the sacrifice. Sale is for Cash only.
If in need of anything for the present or for the future it will surely pay you to look over our bargains^*
