ST. HENRY LAD
Becomes Gunner of Note, Super
lors Saying Work Is Little
Short of Marvelous.
In an official bulletin issued by heud-
fliiarters, United States Marine Corps
Washington, appears the name of Frank
Kothman, St. Henry, this county as hav
ing (nullified for a masksman in the most
interesting branch of the government
service.
Frank, who Is the son of I.ouis Koth
man, St. Henry, enlisted In the United
States Marine Corps at Its Dayton re
cruiting station on July III, 11)15, and is
now serving with the expeditionary force
of marines landed in Hatl lor the pro
lection of American Interests on that
war-torn little isle.
Considering the fact that Kothman is
scarcely more than a recruit, his perfor
mance in gunnery is considered as little
short of marvelous by Murne Corps Offi
cials and they expect him to break some
marksmanship records betore ins enlist
ment expires.
MOVES TO BEST SPOT ON EARTH
Elza McDonald, for three years mana
ger of the Western Ohio Creamery at
their cream station on Wlllple street, in
this city, has resigned and during the

ocrat. TO DEPOSE PARMENTER
A movement has been started by Allen
County Republicans to put W. C. Uar
menter, chairman of the Republican state
central committee, on the shelf. The plan
Is led by James W. Halfhill, Purmenter's
old political buddy, and gains headway
because It is Intended as a reprimand for
assistance in the Burton-Willis slate.
Halfhill will contest Parmenter for the
place on the state central committee.
Among other ramifications of the trouble
Is a wet. and dry scrap, a desire to ditch
Willis and those connected w'th him, and
a double cross-district national delega
tion. LOCAL LUMBER DEALERS WILL

KPERTS
By Win. J. Bryan, in the Commoner
By this time the average man has a
pretty clear understanding of the army
expert, and a well .settled opiiiioln in re
gard to him. It may, however, please the
average man to know that the ruling pus
sinn in the military expert Is understood
by statesmen as well us by the rank and
lile of the people. Lord Salisbury, for In
stance, one of the most distinguished of
the latter-day statesmen of Great Bri
tain, Is quoted us having said to l-ord
Cromer in Kgypt, "Pay no attention to
the military experts, for if they hud their
way, they would fortify Mars to prevent
invasioin from the moon.''
Lord Salisbury is right. There Is noth
ing too ridiculous for them to advise,
They act upon the theory that the na
tion must be prepared to resist ANY AT
TACK THAT CAN BK IMAGl.vKD, no
matter how Improbable il may be. And
there is no limit to the amount of pre
paredness that would become necessary
if the experts controlled the various gov
ernments, because the experts are ull
alike. Fuch group would insist that its
country MI ST HH BKTTKK PRF.PARED
THAN ANY OTIIF.R COUNTRY', and
that means that the rivalry in prepared
ss must ut last absorb all available
money a policy under which each nation
would bankrupt itself in order to keep
other nations from bankrupting it.
U'cording to the theory of our experts.
we must, in Ihe Inst place, nave a navy
able to prevent any enemy from reaching
our shores. In the second place we must
have fortillcations sulllcicnt to prevent
in enemy from landing If it sunk ull of
our ships. Then we must have un army
sulllcicnt to repel any Invasion In case
our navy and fortillcatloins failed to pre
vent a landing. Then we must have a
reserve sulllcicnt to repel the invasion in
case the regular army was not ble to with
stand it. And we must have all our clt
izeits trained in the use of arms so that
they could be called to the colors Imme
diately if the reserve was not sufficient
to support the regular army in its sup
port of the navy. Then the boys in
hool must be trained to be able to take
the place of the adults If the war lasted
long enough to exhuuse the trained men
when culled to support the reserves, when
summoned to support the re'Mtlur ui my
when required to assist the navy, in re
pelling an imaginary foe.
But even this could hardly bo consld
rcd CO.YIPLF.TU preparedness. The wo
men must nave something io cto. iney
lie already being enlisted, and they must
be taken from their ordinary duties und
trained in the making of bandges for the
men who may be wounded If the Imagin
ary foe vanquishes our navy, defeats our
regular army, cuts its way through our
reserve force, overwhelms our host of
trained citizens and slaughters our train
ed schoolboys. The papers sent broadcast
throughout the country a few days ago
the information that one woman hud
agreed to build and equip two hospitals
In case of Invasion.
But the limit has not yet been reached
In getting ready. One of our jingos must
ness men proposed that the manufactur
ing n ants so organized so as to be able
to turn out an inexhaustible number of
motor trucks lor use in case of un invas
ion. And why not organize an automo
bile corps made up of the owners of all
the automobiles in the country? Ought
they not to be ready at a moment's no
tice to carry the soldiers lo the point
needed to meet the attack of this imag
inary foe?
Another Ihougnrrul expert has suggest
(1 Unit oreimredness to be udeouale. must
ilso provide an ample supply of artificial
limbs for ut least two hundred and fifty
thousand nipples why should the nation
be so slothful und unpatriotic us to wait
until these imigunary soldiers have al-
eady lost their limbs in this imaginary
war?
The country should be driven mud or to
nervous prostration, by the dreadful pre
dictions of these, professional soldiers but
for the fact that their conduct furnishes
it sort ot soothing powder. They are to
be found in undiminished numbers ut the
afternoon teas this ought to be sufficient
proof that the enemy is not within sight.
As long us these experts continue to
adorn social functions und enliven dinner
parties with their presence, the country
an rest assured that the enemy is lar
away so far awuy tht we are jus died in
postponing for the present unv 1 N-
CR10ASF in the appropriations for the
army and navy.

REPORT
Of Chattanooga Farmers' Instl
tute - High Spots of Its Big
Annual Program.
By Charles N. Watkins, Secretary.
For the benefit of those who were not
with us during the institute held Feb
ruary IB and 17 at Chattanooga, we will
give a few of the many interesting points
that were discussed.
T. J. Miller, of Bowling Green, Ohio.
gave an able talk on "The Central
Thought in Successful Farming." Be
low are a lew of the many tuoughts giv
en :
We like to be with the largest, strong
est and most important crowd the far
mer. All other people looK to the tanner
for their food supplies. The farmer is
the balance wheel of the human machine.
The central thought of farming' Is the
conservation ol leriiiity.
The successful corn boys manure, fer
tilize and clover the ground they use so
as lo secure the high yeilds.
Plenty of humus in the sod Keeps the
clover, wheat, and meadows from freez-
intr out.
Wc best work for our children by leav
ing them fertile tarms.
Spend more time in thinking out your
plans, it wll Itake less time to do the
work.
Grow the oroducts that go nto your
ground, feeds and avoid adulterations by
unscrupulous dealers.
Consider what a crop vvi. ao toward
keening the fertility of the soil.
A s o betters tne farm every year Dy
trie large umounls ol manure produced.
I'he more cuttle, the more manure, tne
richer the farm.
Oats is a protein and Is a goou grow
ing feed but is not a good fattener.
Corn is the best lattener we nave.
Oats and llax sowed together, ripen to
gether and threshed together, makes an
ideal feed for the growing animal. Ks
peciully tlie work horse and the sow be
fore farrowing.
MucK lands tarm out because ot lacK
of nitrification. To remedy, cover with
manure, plow deep, use clover or peas
every other crop to increase nitrifica
tion. Allalfa was discussed by I. M. Bid-
dlnger, of lOaton, Ohio. A point of in
terest is tint t allallu will grow where
red clover grows.
Lime or innoculatio nls not necessary.
A few of the essentiul things are thor
ough drainage,,, the best of seed bed,
abundance of fertility, freedom from the
weeds and good seed.

Ohio State Journal, Rep.
The omens ure gathering which point
to the greut prominence of Roosevelt
us a candidate before the Kepublicun
national convention. His figure grows
bigger every day and already it over
shadows most of the "already men
tioned." Here is a reactionary paper
The Public Ledger, of Philadelphia,
in a long editorial telling us that Root's
great speech at New York was Roos-
evcltian throughout, not that it advo
cated his nomination, but thut it was
in uccord with his sentiments. Its
strong, belligerent tone was Roosevelt's.
It seemed almost like a neffort to pre
pare the ground for the Colonel, who
went immediately to the West Indies,
to return in a few days to face tlie ov
erwhelming ovation and to protest
against his candidacy in an unavailing
manner. What a stir among the pa
nics would the nomination ol the colo
nel arouse!
