Signature of Tlio Gov
ernor. Trankfort, Feb. 23. With 250
Mils In tho' hopper of tho lower
branch of the General Assembly and
34C In the Senate, Kentucky solons
will havo to step lively during the
noxt few days If they aro to get many
of tho measures on tho road to the
executlvo ofllco before tho rules com
mittee take chargo of legislation In
both houses. n
Only eloven measures thus far havo
passed both branches and only one,
tho anti-pass bill, has received tho
signature of tho governor.cotnplctlng
Its trip through the legislative mill.
Two other measures have passed
both houses and now are in tho hands
of the governor, but his signature
has not yet been-affixed.
One provides for a stenographer
for tho state Inspector and examiner
and the other permits second-class
cities to, acquire law libraries. None
of the other measuers which have
passed both branches has reached
tho chief executive.
Administration Measures.
At least five of the bills which
have been piloted through the two
houses can bo classed as administra
tion measures and there was Uttlo
opposition to any of them except
from tho Republican minority. The
Democratic members of both branch
es havo ovldenced a determination
to push through the measures prom
ised In tho cnmpalgn pledges and in
tho Democratic platform and in that
determination tho members of the
majority t have been acting as a
unit. ' y
The rules committee will tako
chargo. of legislation 1n the Senate
for the last fifteen days of tho ses
sion whllo In the House the rules
commltteo will take chargo, of the
last ten days, beginning March 3.
There will bo a scramble during the
next fow days, especially in tho
House to get pet measures acted up
on before th'cy fall afoul of the rules
commlttc, whero they must Temaln
unless tho members of that commit
tee see fit to bring them out or tho
House by a two-thirds vote forces
such action.
Made Special Orders.
Representative Lee's measure to
make Ellzabethtown a fourth class
-city has been made a special order
for to-morrow morning at 11 o'clock
and probably will be passed by tho
Houso with little delay and without
any opposition.
The bill offerod by Representative
White, to rollevo tho condition exist
ing In the ofllco of State Superintend
ent Gilbert and which provides for
four clerks and five stenographers in
that department, will come up as a
sjpoclal order at 2 o'clock tomorrow
afternoon.
Tho court of appeals held recently
that Superintendent Gilbert had no
authority to employ clerks and sten
ographers that havo been required to
keep up tho work of tho ofllco and It
was to rollevo that condition that tho
bill was Introduced. There will bo
little opposition to the passago of tho
bill iu the Houso, it Is believed, and
Us -Journey through tho Senato prob
ably will bo mado with llttlo dissent.
The Houso calendar contains 24
bills, while tho list in tho orders of
the day includes more than a hun
dred. Deep down in the list aro many
dear to the hearts of their authors
which may nover gqt any farther
along uuless tho authors can secure
the help of their colleagues and force
them to the front. That will prove
a hard matter, however, for the list
includes more than halt of the mem
bership) each of whom Is equally anx
ious to give his bill precedence and
wttrnot consent to sidestep his own
measure to give those of others the
,'rlght of way.
House Laggtag Behlad.
The House is far behind the Sen
te, but there is an apparent deter
mination to catch up, and although it
may require two and three sessions
each day to accomplish, what Is ne
cessary to be done, tho members ap
pear Inclined to put their shoulders
to tho wheel and grind out measures
as rapidly ns Is possible.
Now that the end of tho session Is
so near, extra session talk Is loom
ing largo and many of the members
of both houses, Including persons
close to the Governor, express the
opinion than an extra session will
bo necessary. Tho objection offer
ed, tho condition of the state treas-
I ury, they say makes It absolutely lm
peratlvo to hold an extra session and
formulate a tax system that will re
lievo the condition of the treasury.
I That It will be next to lmpossibla
1 (o oven tako up the tax matter at tho
present session Is conceded and un
less an extra session Is held members
say there will be no, chance to reduce
the Indebtedness appreciably, despite
tho fact that the Legislature has
frowned on all appropriations and Is
making every effort to cut down ex
penditures. 'Last Leap Year Trescnt Claimed.

WILSON OPPOSES
TAhlMi ACTION
FEARS EMBARRASSMENT IN NE
GOTIATIONS WITH GERMAN
GOVERNMENT.
SITUATION IS GRAVE
Congress Does Not Take Kindly To
The Warning of- American
Citizens.
i Washington, Feb. 23. Agitation
in Congress for action warning Amer
icans off armed ships of the Europe
an belligerents suddenly grew to
such proportions today that the Dem
ocrats of the Foreign Affairs Commit
tee voted to canvass the sentiment of
the House on' several pending res
olutions of that nature.
Sentiment in the Senato in favor
of some such action also was openlydlct was near at one time when three
expressed, but at tho end of a day of
surprises, tentlon and agitation the'
word came that President Wilson still
was unalterably opposed to any such
action'by Congress and believed that
he would only be .embarrassed there -
by In negotiations with Germany.
To widely circulated suggestions'
that the situation had reached a point .-qVlttal, and hopes for a verdict were
whero the President soon would lay 'given up. This case attracted con
it before Congress, that Secretary alterable attention, owing to the
Lansing might in some way define prominence of all parties involved,
the attitude of the Government in -a" and at times the court hall was pack

in which the United States would Tne 80 of Tucker vs. City of

tlon to abandon the announced ln -
tention to sink armed merchant ships
without warning, the uniform, state
ment was made officially that noth
ing had been determined Upon, that
the situation, though grave, still was
a waiting one, and 'that no final posi
tion would be announced until Ber
lin was heard from.
While confronted with the possl-
blllty of congressional Interference
with all Its grave aspects, ranging
from a defection from the American
policy to downright. embarrassment
of the President and tho Secretary-of
State the leaders were confident they
would control the Bltuatton and leave
tho executlvo branch of the Govern-
ment free to carry on diplomatic ne
gotiatlons with Germany.
, At no time did the question come
out openly on the floor of either the
House or tho Senate, but about a
score of Congressmen who announc-
ed they were In favor ot warning
Americans even It it involved a re-
pudlatlon of the Administration poI:

In a state of tension that practically
blocked business.
All the demonstration was in the
Democratic ranks and there was no
open show ot sentiment among the
Republicans. It was indicated, how
ever, that Republican Leader Mann
sympathized with President Wilson's
policy and that any outbreak would
imvu lu icvnuu mill ma iuivcb. i
From apparently authentic sources
came statements to-night that the
President was determined that the
dispute ponding with Germany bo
settled without prolonged negotla-
Ha In lr Afitti Itnl I Awn 1 tF
ever, that tho breaking off of diplo
matic relations with Germany means
war, and there will be no undue
haste in handling the situation In
volving suchr a possibility,
Tho Administration view is that a
broad and Important principle Is lu-1
volved in the right of Americans to
travel on belligerent merchantmen,
i a. a. i i
nnd that this right must not bo aban
doned.
Developments are expected mo
mentarily, To-morrow may bring
Germany's reply to the request ot
tho United States, mude last week
through Ambassador von Bernstorff,
,for assurances that the notice ot In
tention to sink armed merchantmen
without warning after February 29
does not nullity previous pledges giv
en in the Arabic and Lusttanla nego
tiations. Official advices from Ber
lin have Indicated that Germany will
reply that previous assurances will
not be affected, but' that they ap

OHIO COUNTY HAY
BOUGHT BY ALLIES
DETROIT FIRM HAS MAN HERE
BUYING FEED FOR HORSES
AT THE FRONT
Jno. L. Titus, of the firm of Peter
Backer Co., Detroit Mich., has for
the laBt several days been in Hart
ford buying and shipping Ohio county
hay for 'the Allies. Several cars
have already been shipped from
Hartford, Dundee and other points
along the M. H. & E. railroad, and
before Mr. Titus leaves, about the
1st of April, 'he expects to buy over
a hundred cars from Ohio county.
A fair price Is being paid the farmers
and all hay is being bought that is
reasonably free from weeds. The
spring weather of this week offered
a good opportunity for delivery aud
there were lively scenes around the
depot.
The hay Is shipped from here to
Atlanta, Ga., where it is rebaled, six
ot our standard bales being pressed
into one there. It Is then sent di
rectly to England and thence to the
front, provided It does not encoun
ter a German submarine on the way
over.
This demand for grass will bring
much money into Ohio county and
the Tanners who converted their to
bacco fields into, meadows laBt year
are fortunate. Seventy cars will be
shipped from Hartford at $14 a too,
amounting to a total ot 840 tons, or
$11,760. Tho shipment from the
entire county will bo near 1,500 tons,
and will bring tho farmers $21,000.
County Demonstrator Browder was
active In bringing about the pooling
ot the county crop ot hay and he was
also Instrumental In bringing about
tho sale. Tltua would not havo come
here had he not have been assured of
a certain tonnage and this could not
havo been linil thero been no pool.

GRAVE CHARGE
AGAINST STANLEY
CONSPIRACY ENTERED INTO TO
PUT LIQUOR INTERESTS
IN TOWER .,
LEGISLATURE AROUSED -
Evening Post of Yesterday Clalsttf
Attmpt to Overthrow Self
Govern meat.
Frankfort, Ky., Feb. 24. The
second big sensation of thelegisla
tlve session at Frankfort broke
Thursday morning, when It became
known that backers of the Stanley
administration have practically
thrown off the mask and are opehty
at work in a fight to secure legisla
tion that will enable them, If success
ful, to overthrow local self-govern'
ment In Louisville and a dozen other
places In the State, and centralize
everything In a vast liquor machine
at Frankfort, to be controlled by the
Governor and bJs personal coterie
and to be used for political purposes
in the next t.w days.
The "arrow point" of the legisla
tive fight, as planned by Mr. Stan
ley's backers, is directed against the
Democratic city administration and
the Democratic committee In Louis
ville, and one of the things hoped
for is that not only will Gov. Stanley
and his associates be able to abolish
the local committee In Louisville and
Install a new committee, of which the
talk Is Mr. James P. Edwards is .to
be chairman, but to put themselves
In a position also to enable Gov,
Stanley to remove from office, tho
Mayor of Louisville and other" pub
lic officials that are thought to stand
for self-government and fill the of
fices in Louisville with m,eu chosen
from Frankfort.
War of Extermination.
It is not only Louisville, howev
er, tlyit Is aimed at. Through' bills
now pending, which are expected to
be suitably amended at the last mo
ment, it possible," the backers and as
sociates ot Mr. Stanley hope to put
themselves in a position "to put out
of business" duly elected public of
ficers In many places. A long list
of public officers, many ot them
Commonwealth Attorneys and Coun
ty Attorneys, Is understood to have
been made up for destruction. The
plan Is to get a bill passed by the
Legislature empowering the Govern
or to "remove" public officers who
"fall" to enforce the law. The Gov
ernor la to be the Judge and the ex
ecutions would be numerous.
Legislature Aroused. i
The whole Legislature and, It Is
now believed, the whole State is
aroused by the last desperate at
tempt to accomplish, through substi
tutes for the Greene bill, what Was
planned In 'the unlamented excise
bill, and It is now predicted that the
latest coup of the Stanley adminis
tration will fail as decisively as the
first. Every vote from Louisville in
the House will be thrown against the
Stanley substitute, and It Is believed
that Mr. Frnk Greene and the whole
temperance element In the Legisla
ture will lino up with the supporters
of homo rule against the revolution
ary proposals as represented by Gov
ernor Stanley and his backers.
