Candidates)
It looks like the crop of candidate!
will be up to the average. While no
announcement! have been made thui
far, thoro will be plenty of aiplranti.
Jobi are acarce thla year of Wilson
and office with a salary attachment
looka pretty good to the average clt
Isen. Judge Rakln will be a candidate
for re-election and hai ao announced
t:. fact to hi! friends. He will be
posed by A. W. Norblad of As
toria, who haa anuounced his candl
ey in down river papers.
For district attorney, W. H. Cooper
tie present Incumbent, I uncertain
bet her he will enter the flold or
not. In fact he says ho has not given
V subject much study and eipressei
nelt aa undecided and Indifferent.
Olun H. Metskor's friends have
t let ted him to make the race for
t .t office and while he has not fully
r do up his mind, he will probably
$:.f his castor Into the ring.
For representative In tho leglsla
t re, Fred W. Herman of Rainier, has
t ad his declaration for that offlce
1th the secretary of state. His slo
f B Is "Smaller appropriations, con
i Jdation of state commissions, state
I jhways and lower taxei." A dandy
t d platform, but it will be mighty
t .rd to deliver the goodi. It Is to be
hoped that the next legislature will
fee more successful than the last ses
sion, especially In tho way of consoli
dation of commissions.
It Is stated on the streets that M.
t C. Miller would not decline the nam
(ration for representative. He was
f morly a member of that body and
' yd a good record.
Some of Mayor Morton's friends
roached him on the subject of
.king the race, and he may yield to
I lr wishes, although he has not
I )y made up his mind. It Is safe
ti aay, however, that he will permit
Ce use of his name.
. 3. II. Collins of Kalnior, who rep
roentod this count? in the last legls
I 'ire, may become a factor as he
k:'ds this county as his home, al
t ngh engaged in school work In
I rion.
Attorney A. W. Mueller aspires to
Mat In tho leglslaturo and has da
C'ed to make the race for the Re
( .oilcan nomination.
Thero la talk of W. J. Fullerton
entering the flold under the Demo
c alio banner. He was defeated for
f at office two years ago. His
f. :nds claim It he would "get busy"
ti could win out.
For county clerk, Mr. A. H. Bar-
:tt, the present Incumbent, seems
U nave no opposition.
The race for sheriff promises to be
t usually interesting, as there are
( era! In the running, with other
I Klncts to hoar from.
Shorltf Stanwood will be a candl-
to for re-election and will trust
I I fate to Republican voters on his
' Iclal record.
3. L. Chlttlm, city marshal, will
-ke an effort to secure the noralna
n, and has already mapped out his
npatgn.
Then it Is reported that Martin
kite will throw his hat Into the
g and make a lively race for the
riff goal.
3. H. Wellington Is watching the
t us and If the political planets move
I way, he mtfy be set down as an
r Jlrant.
It may also be mentioned that R.
Hattan, Democrat, has his eagle
on this offloe. It has been re
' Med by the "crystal globe" that
r, Hattan figures that the Repub
an candidates will get to scrapp
I among themselves and he will

it Republicans are going to unite

As the political bulletin board
nds now, Mr. Hattan will be a can

days."
Mr. McCormlck said that tho new
steam schooner ordered, which Is to
carry 1,600,000 feot of lumber, will
not be equipped with passenger ac
commodations and with that space
available she would be only 20 feet
longer than the stcames Klamath, of
the McCormlck floet, which has a
length of 207.6 foot. Tho machinery
will be turnod out at Snn Francisco
by the United Engineering Works,
which built the engine ot the Klam
ath, and the now machinery will be
virtually a dupllcato set, as the
Klamath Is classed as the most power
ful In the fleot. The now steamer Is
Intended for the offtihoro trade, ply
ing to the Hawailans, the West Coast
and Mexico.
The two englnos for the auxiliary
schooner City of Portland, which Is
to bo finished tho lattor part of
March, reached New York from Nor
way February 12, and were shipped
by rail for St. Helens February 16.
Frames are bolng got out for the
second auxiliary schooner, to be a
duplicate of tho City of Portland.
The steamer will bo started on the
ways to be vacated by the first
schoonor and, with tho second under
way and the Ruby, nn auxiliary
schoonor contracted for with Captain
William Wrlghtson, of Mobile, also

An Inquiry has boon rocelved from
British Columbia to build an auxili
ary schoonor, two hove been forward
ed by Now York interests and yester
day a San Franclh-n firm asked for

trade, but with work already under
taken no additional contracts can be
figured on.

SLOGAN WANTED
The managers ot the Columbia
County Fair want a slogan, some

Featured
Tho St. Helens Woman's Club held
an enjoyable meeting Wednesday af
ternoon at the home of Mrs. J. W.

MONEY FOR
COLUMBIA COUNTY
Editor St. Helens Mist:
I take pleasure in advising
you that the river and harbor
bill ordered reported yesterday
to the House of Representa
tives, contains a total appropri
ation of $1,697,000 for nine
rivers and harbors in our dls- .
trlct, and provision is made for
five surveys upon which to base
other projects of Improvement.
The appropriations in the bill
embrace the full recommenda
tions of the United States En
gineers for all our projects, as
they revised two of their orig
inal estimates to conform to
later conditions and after tak
ing the position that there
would be anothor river and
harbor bill enacted, In all
probability, before March 4,
1917, and that all river and
harbor appropriations become
immediately available upon the
passage ot the laws. $360,000
of the above amount is for the
Columbia and lower Willamette
rivers bolow Portland, and $1,
200,000 for continuing the im
provement at the mouth of the
Columbia river. Two of the
Ave surveys are for deep and
straight channels from the
cities of Rainier and St. Hel
ens to deep water In the Co
lumbia river, which are the
first steps to be taken in these
matters.
With best wishes, I am,
truly yours,
W. C. HAWLEY.

The special train stopped at the

OBITUARY.
Julia Johnson was born in Nor
way, June 7, 1880. She was married
to Charles Bergstrom, Aug. 11, 1905,
died at Scappoose, Feb. 14, 1916.
Her parents' names were Sever and
Bertha Johnson. The deceased's age
was 36 years. She was a dear and
true wife and a kind neighbor and
friend to all whom she met. Inter
ment took placo at Falrview ceme
tery on last Wednesday. Services
were conducted by Rev. C. H. John
ston. TAKE WARNING
February 13th, two men were seen
entering the woods in the neighbor
hood ot Bachelor Flat, with guns and
dogs. It Is fair to presume that they
were after deer. After deer or any
other game animal or fowl that has
survived this winter, it would be a
shame to hunt them now. The men
should cease their efforts at once as
tho state game warden has been In
formed of their act and their move
ments will bo closely watched.
GETTING READY FOR
SECOND COUNT, MAR. 7
Ballot Box Will (lose at 3:00 P. M.,
When Votes Will Be Counted
Tho Mist great piano voting contest
is reaching normal proportion now. It
has come to where you can't tell who
Is leading. So many have brought in
subscriptions and received their
voteB, and some have so many that
no one can even guess which one has
the most. There is quite a demand
for merchants' coupons, too. These
are the little jokers that will prob
ably tell the story in the end, and
this is the way our readers can help.
It does not cost you a cent when you
buy groceries, dry goods, hardware,
furniture, drugs, or whatever the ad
vertisers in the contest have to offer,
and then as the contestant comes to
you, you will have a pleasant little
surprise for her that will prove you
a person who thinks of others, and it
will make her pleased with you.
Every one of the ladles who are
out for that piano want it, and they
are trying in every honorable way to
come Into possession of it. It is
simply a question of which one you
like best. Of course you like them
all, and St. Helens and vicinity have
nothing nicer than these contestants,
and what is nicer for a lady, whether
old or young, and her circle of friends
than a nice piano and such a one for
lnstanco, as the Mist is to give to the
lady that the people of St. Helens and
vicinity like the best.
Boar in mind that the ballot box
is closed for tho second count at 3 p.
m. on March 7. Bo sure and have
your votes all In by that time so that
you will have a fair chance to show
what you are standing tor.
Others were nominated, but as yet
have received no votes. These young
ladies should by no means be con
sidered out of the running, as all
havo been doing somo work and they
will make the contest interesting for
those who already have a good start.
Remember that many of our lead
lng merchants aro Interested in this
contest and givo 25-vote coupons
with every dollar's purchase. Also
those who don't fully understand the
rules and regulations of this contest
can call at this offlce, or write to us,
and wo will be pleased to go over the
proposition with them.
A PERILOUS SKI TRIP
A Vancouver paper has an Illus
tration of Mrs. Alexander Philip
daughter-in-law of John Philip and
well known in this city, who acted as
guide for a skiing party In the tim
ber wilds of British Columbia. We
publish the following extract:
Regular practice on skis enabled
Mrs. Alexander Philip, proprietress
of Rainbow Lodge at Alta Lake, on
the Pacific Great Eastern - Railway
to take the role of guide and pace
maker when a party of trainmen,
railway employees and settlers from
the district around the summit of
the line, decided to get to Squam
ish over the blockaded line. Twenty
persons mushed into civilization on
skis and snowshoes after being ma'
rooned tor ten days by the heavy
snowfall that made the P. G. E. Im
passable tor traffic. Mrs. Philip led
the way and made the trip with less
exertion than the majority of the
men in the party. She and her hus
band are making their home in Van'
couver until a chlnook clears the
blockaded passes.

KNIGHTS OF PYTHIAS
HAVE ROLL CALL
Celebration of Their Fifty-First An
niversary
The Knights of Pythias lodge held
their annual "Roll Call" Tuesday
evening. About 50 of the 84 mem
bers of tho local lodge answered In
person when their names wero called
and several others sent letters which
were read at that time. Some ot the
out-of-town members present were:
Dr. H. R. Cliff, J. S. Watts, N. A.
Perry, E. D. McKay, John Popejoy, I.
S. Wlkstrom, Chas. Wikstrom, John
Scott, D. E. Freeman, W. J. Fuller
ton, J. B. Godfrey, Fred Henderson,
Wm. E. Snild and Fred Adams, com
ing from Portland, Scappoose, Ridge
field, Kalama, Deer Island and other
places.
Fourteen members of Rainier, 13
of Kalama, and about six of Ridge
field lodges, were present, besides a
few other visitors.
After a very enjoyable time at the
ball until 11 o'clock, they proceeded
to the St. Helens hotel, where a sump
tuous banquet was served, which was
much enjoyed by all, after which the
company departed to their several
homes, wishing for many more such
occasions.
FAIR COMMISSIONERS
G. L. Tarbell ot Yankton, and R.
N. Loveland of Rainier, were In the
city Saturday attending to the prelim
inaries ot organizing tho fair board.
No official business, however, was
transacted as a quorum was not pres
ent. Mr. Fullerton is still detained
in Portland on the Federal jury, but
the commissioners nope to have a
meeting soon. This is a matter that
should not be delayed. Columbia
county can put up one of the best
county fairs in the state, but it re
quires united action and co-operation
of every producer from potatoes to
poultry and from handiwork to
horses. The date of holding the fair
will be decided when officers are
elected.
EASTER IS LATE
Easter will be late this year. The
date is April 23, which is within two
days of the latest date possible for
the observance of the festival under
the system of reckoning fixed by the
council of Nice. This council decreed
that Easter should be observed on the
first Sunday after the full moon that
occurs after, the vernal equinox
March 21. In 1915 the date of East
er was April 4. The Lenten season
in 1915 began February 17, and this
year it will begin March 8. The last
time that Easter was as late as April
23, was in 1905.
CASE DISMISSED
Mrs. Bertha Berkhart of Deer Isl
and, was arrested on complaint of
Gustav Jasper, who cha-ged that Mrs.
Berkhart threatened to shoot him.
She was arraigned before Justice
Philip Monday, and after hearing the
evidence, dismissed the case.
