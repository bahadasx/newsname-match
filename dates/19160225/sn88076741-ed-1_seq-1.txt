PROGRESS OF THE WAR.
Along the battle lines in France there
has been heavy fighting in some locali
ties. In the results we gather that on
the whole the Germans made the most
gains of trenches but a heavy cost in
men. This seem to be the usual result.
Either side can gain some yards of tren
ches if they are willing to pay the price
in blood.
The Italians claim to have made some
real progress in the mountain fighting,
but the nature of which is indefinite, be
cause the territory is so rugged.
In northern Russia there is fighting
but no definite results told. At Salon
ika, where the French and English sent
troops several weeks ago, and where a
large. German and Bulgarian army had
gathered to oppose them, nothing has so
far happened, though a big battle was
long expected there.
The real sensation of the last ten days
has been the success of the Russians
over tbe Turks at Erzerum. This is a
fortified city in a section of country ly
ing east of the Black sea. The opera
tions area part of the campiagn of "the
Caucasia*' to the command of which,
Grand Duke Nicholas was sent a few
monthB ago when he was deposed from
the position of commander of the Rus
sian artny. Evidently the Grand Duke
is making good and possibly the strate
gic situation of all the contending armies
may be. affected by his continued suc
cess. Accounts vary as to what the
Russians captured at Erzerum but ap
pears to be no doubt the defeat of the
Turks and that they are in rapid retreat
to the coast of tbe Black sea.
One of the remote possibilities of
thiB
sucsess of the Russians is, that Con
stantinople might find her enemies
knocking at her back door in the near
future, which door though strongly forti
fied is not made by nature nearly so im
pregnable as tbe Galipoli peninsula.
Diplomatically, the warring nations
are certainly keeping Unole Sam busy
scratching bis head solving propblems
of international law aa well aa many
other problems that are not in the
inter,
national code. The most of the trouble own controversies with strikes or lock*
comea from the new features oaused by outs, which are really nothing but fights
submarine warfare. (which are but struggles of might with

There is a marked increase in aerial
warfare. Battles of planes in fleets are
getting common, while bomb drop
pings here and there are every day oc
currences. So far, however, aeroplanes
have not shown that they are invincible,
as it is common for them to beshotdown
by artillery, while it usually takqs but a
short time to bring hostile planes against
them.
The English Parliament has voted for
an addional loan of two billions of dol
lars. They are trying to keep the ex
pense account down to twenty-tive mil
lions daily. Such amounts are beyond
the average human mind.
IMPENDING STRIKES
There are two great strikes impend
ing either of wiiich if it should occur,
will have greater effect on business and
comfort then any that have ever pre
viously been experienced.
Tbe first, is an impending stricke of
the anthracite coal miners. Many of us
can remember what the effect of such a
strike had on us that live here in a cold
climate. What might have finally re
sulted if Roosevelt had not taken tbe
coal barons figuratively if not actually
by the ears, we do not know, whai he
said to them has never been given out
but the strike was soon over. The pre
sent proposed strike is more extensive
and a new feature is that they propose
to make the contracts with the owners
to expire in the feature at the same
time as do the contracts of the bitumin
ous miners, with the object of having
the power to all join in a simultaneous
strike in the future.
Such a strike great as its conse
quences would be, is insignificant com
pared with a strike which is said to be
now being submitted to vote among the
members of the four great and most in
telligent railway brotherhoods, that of
the engineers, the firemen, the conduct
ors and the train men. Practically all
railways from Chicago west and south
are affected. In the latter case the rail
way men are asking according to the
managers for about 30 per cent increase
in wages and an eight hour day. The
proposed raise means, according to the
same authority, about a hundred mil
lions of dollars per year increase in
wages. They also say that the eight
hour day on a railway is a different af
fair than that in a factory or shop. A
day's work in the factory is a days
work whether the hours be ten or less,
but in railroading there are two was of
figuring a days work, either in hours or
miles. A hundred mile run is a days
work no matter how much less than ten
hours it may take to run it. When a
man cheks up his "day" he takes hours
or miles, whichever is best for him.
Further, no matter how short the time
or how few the miles, it is a days work
if the train man is called to work.
This is tbe situation as the managers see
it. They claim that the railroads can
not stand the increase in wages unless
tares and freight rates are correspond
ingly increased. It is true that while al
most everything else has increased in
cost during the last few years that there
has been no corresponding increase in
railroad charges.
That is to say, that the threatened
strickes of the coal miners and the rail
way unions is practically and will ulti
mately and actually be a strike against
the people who are buyers of coal and
patrons of the railways—and that means
every man, woman and child in the
whole country.
Really, it is simply a question whether
the general public are willing to advance
and pay the wages of these employes or
not.
What are you going £to do about it
dear people? It is up to you. You will
have the bills to pay.
This paper has often expressed its
opinion in the past that it is absurd to
permit aotive disputants to settle their
