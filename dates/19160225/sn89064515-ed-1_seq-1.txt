the local boys
state quint a defeat
Tuesday evening
17, in one of the fastest game's ever
witnessed here. Every member of
both teams was in the game froim the
start and it was nip and .tuck'until
the finish. A big crowd witnessed the
game and did all in their power to
help the local boys to victory, by root
ing.
Little Falls had t-he 'edge on the vis
itors in basket-shooting but had a
large number of fouls called on them
and the visitors did most of their
scoring on fouls, Johnson, the Bemidji
free-throw star planting the ball in
the basket almost every time.
The first half ended in a tie of 6
and 6, neither side scoring a point in
the last few minutes of play of that
half. In the second half, the locals
fought with more vigor, however, and
found the basket more readily. Be
langer was disqualified in the middle
of the second half after making four,
personal fouls. One of the Bemidji
boys made three.
It is believed that the outcome of
this game will cause a three-cornered
fight for the district champibnship.
Bemidji and Little Falls have broken
even and Brainerd has defeated
both of them. Should Bemiaji win
from Brainerd in the return game
and if Little Falls defeats Brainerd,
as it hopes to do, all three teams will
have an equal chance. The committee
on athletics will probably have to de
cide the question in such an event and
it is possible that the three teams
would have to play-for high honors on

Little Falls, Minn.
Gentlemen: Since the issuance of
our approximate-and temporary price
list No. 32, manufacturers have found
it necessary to further advance prices
on book, writing, bond, ledger papers,
envelopes, card boards, etc., and de
liveries are becoming more difficult.
Our customers may rest assured that
we shall bill out all goods ordered
from us at prices as low as conditions
will' justify or permit.
