Two War lords Meet.
In answer to the French claims that
the Germans have suffered enormous
losses, theGerman war office declared
that the French losses thus far have
been extraordinarily severe.
Berlin also reported the capture of
immense quantities of supplies, the
exact amount having not yet been
compiled.
The two war lords of Furope are
now directing the operations in the
great battle for Verdun. Paris dis
patches this afternoon reported that
General Joffre has arrived at the
French front and is personally direct
ing the defense of the fortress. The
news has created great enthusiasm in
Paris.
Lull In Battle.
Across the battlefront the kaiser,
surrounded by his ablest staff officers
and the crown prince, are planning the
blow being Btruck in the greatest Ger
man offensive since the defeat of the
Marne.
Though there is an apparent con
tradiction between the Berlin and
French official statements, the latter
reporting a lull of infantry action, it is
believed the Paris official report cov
ers later operations. It appears prob
able that the operations mentioned by
Berlin occurred early last evening and
that following these reported ad
vances, there was little or no infantry
fighting on the Verdun front, as Paris
claims, this afternoon.
Chock Only Temporary.
The check reported to have been
administered to the advancing Ger
mans may be only temporary. All
Paris dispatches today agreed that
the titanic struggle tn the Meuse
woods mark the beginning of the
greatest German offensive blow since
the drive on Paris was defeated at
the Marne early in the war. Dis

PANIC ON FAKE RUMOR
Chicago Board of Trade to Investigate
Slump in Wheat Price.
Chicago. Feb. 25. A rumor, which
was dented, but which, while it was
current on the board of trade near the
close yesterday, sent the price of wheat
down seven cents, will be investigated
by a committtee of the board, it was
stated today.
The rumor was to the effect that the
German ambassador had been hand
ed his passports. It began circulating
about fifteen minutes before the close
and denial of its truth came too
to chock the decline. It is estimated
roughly that bull leaders dumped six
million bushels overboard and forced
other holders in this and outside mar
kets to follow suit.
WHEAT MARKKT KECVIRATKS
Opens Higher Today and Panicky
Symptoms of Yesterday disappear.
Chicago. Feb. 25. Instead of show
ing a fresh break in values the wheat
markets today surprised many trad
ers by opening at an advance. Open
ing quotations Jl 18 to $1.194 for
May and $l.14i to $1.15 for July,
were to 1 higher than yesterday s
finish. The reason for the upturn
seemed to be a reaction of the semi
panicky felling of yesterday and op
timism on the part of a majority cf
dealers that some practical way cut of
the difficulty with Germany would v t
be found.
Despite considerable nervoutmess
that was shown by a series of rapid
fluctuations, the market kept within a
normal range today, the difference be
tween highest and lowest prices being
less than 3 cents. Closing prices were
firm at lc net advance, with May
$1.18 and July $1.15T.

tory Offense Case.
Telling a simple story of the alleged
attempt of Charles Smith, a one-armed
piano player, to commit a statutory
offense against her, Pearl Higginbot
tom, 13 years old and pretty, went
on the stand in the court of Topka
this morning as the principal -witness
against Smith. When the preliminary
hearing came up before Judge Rich
er, Rad Lee, deputy county attorney,
submitted to the court an amended
complaint charging an attempted stat
utory offense. Smith was arrestetl on
warrant charging the actual com
mission of the crime. The amendment
was allowed by Judge Fisher and tes
timony or the girl and her motner was
taken. D. D. Mote, who witn in
Rooney, is representing Smith, waived
testimony for defense. Then W. 13.
Atchison, county attorney, appeared
in the court room and asked that the
complaint be amended again to read
as originally charging the commission
of the crime. Mote objected as the
defendant had been tried on the
charge of attempting the offense.
Judge Fisher adjourned court until
afternoon at 2 o'clock when the mat
ter was threshed out.
Owing to the nature of the case, the
court room was cleared during the
preliminary by Judge Fisher. The
room was pp.cked with spectators in
expectancy of racy testimony when
Judge Fisher made tne oraer. inar
hhal Frost cleared the rooms and al
though tho crowd was orderly in fil
ing out protests of dissatisfaction were
heard among the would-be listeners
after they were once outside.
Her Motlier Testifies.
Mrs. L,. B. Higginbottom. mother of
the girl, was the first to take the
stand. She testified that her daugh
ter was 13 years old. Until a few
days ago Mrs. Higginbottom was em
ployed as cashier and a musician at
the Best theater, she said. She said
Smith asked her once about the age
of her daughter. She said she saw
her daughter and Smith talking to
gether at the Best.
Then the girl took the stand. Rad

awav to Grove, Kan., where she wasl
found with Hazel Gardner, age li,
dressed In hovs clothes she was a pu
pil in the Fifth grade at Harrison
school.
"Do you know Smith?" asked Lee.
"Yes."
"How long?"
"Since before last Christmas, when
mother worked at the Best as cashier
and piano player.
"You went there?"
"Yes, about once a week."
"When did you first meet Smith?"
Met Him Before Christmas.
"Quite a while before Christmas."
"You talked to him?"
"TPS."
Who would start the conversa
tions?
"Mr. Smith."
"Ever go anywhere with Smith?" '
"No."
"Ever go any place where he was?"
"Yes, to his room on West Sixth."
"Why did you go?"
"He told me he had something to
show me."
"The first tinre you went there, who
was there?"
"The landlady and Smith."
"After she left after you came In.
was there anyone besides you and
Smith there?"
"No."
"What did Smith do and say then?"
"He put his arm around nre and
told me how nice I was."
"Was there anything offensive
then?"
"No."
"Did you go again?"
"Yes, a few days after that."
"Who was with you?"
Others Were There.
"Susie Zelington."
"Anyone else there?"
"Ed Delaney."
The girl- stated that Smith indirect
ly proposed improper acts. "I told
him no," she testified. "And then I
left."
"Did you go again?"
"Yes, three or four davs later."
"Why?"
"He said he was sorry and prom
ised not to act that way again."
"There was another girl with me
when I went the third time," explained
the witness. "When we got to Mr.
Smith's room she combed her hair
and went out. I went behind the
door."
It was then the girl said Smith came
in and made the attempt to commit
improper acts. She claimed to have
struggled but made no outcry.
"I refused," she said, "and he
slapped me."
D. D. Mote then took the witness
for cross-examination. Under Mote's
questioning the girl stated "that
Smith asked the other girl In the
room to go out."
"Why did you go up to Smith's
room ?" asked Mote.
"Because I cared for him."
"Did you ever ask him for money?"
Asked Him for Money.
"Afterwards I told him I had ought
to have $5."
"Didn't you accuse him and threat
en to tell on him if he didn't give you
money."
"I told him I would tell."
"Whom were you going to tell?"
"1 don't know."
"What did you want with the
money?"
"To go away." (The girl stated that
the demand was made a short time be
fore the Grove escapade.)
"Did you ever tell on him?"
"I never told anyone except Haze!

Germans Won't Defy U. S. by
More Sub Warfare.
London, Feb. 25. Germany, in her
reply to the latest representation from
America, asks the United States to de
fine offensive armament, according to
unconfirmed Amsterdam dispatches
received here today.
The German foreign office, accord
ing to the Amsterdam report, asks the
United States to specify what size of
a gun it deems necessary for defen
sive purposes. In this manner, Am
sterdam reported, Germany hopes to
force from the American state depart
ment an exact definition of offensive
and defensive armament that may
prov embarrassing to owners of bel
ligerent ships, which have, been en
tering American ports with guns of
comparatively large calibers.
Keep Issue Open.
It is believed too, that Germany
hopes in this manner to prolong the
negotiations until srntiment in both
countries over the new armed mer
chantmen crisis has subsided, when
German diplomats will find an agree
able way of extricating themselves
from an awkward position.
The report has naturally upset Eng

Previously, it was believed Germany

possibly within twenty-four hours. Of

Northern Pacific's eastbound North
Coast limited train near Covington,
25 miles east of Seattle, last night and
after uncoupling the baggage and
mall cars, which they ran a short dis
