OF AMERICA
Everyone knows that the gaug
spirit is very strong in boys,; but
how strong it is few realize wlio
' Lave uot made a study of the psy-
chology of the child or had experi
. ence with the semi-criminal'gaugs
. of the. large cities. This spirit
. makes its appeals to the best in
the boy his courage aud loyalty
, v and from that very fact it is eapa
- ble of doing great harm whenmis
directed. - ' , '. .
The organization known as the
Boy Scouts of America was formed
for the purpose of enlisting, this
force oil the side, of , those ideals
t which make for the moral, and
. physical 'health and efficiency of
the boy, and five year's experience
. shpws that it works! Whoever has
Seen a tronp of Boy Scouts stand
ing at attention right hand at sa
lute eyes on the flag, repeating
the 'scout oath aud law noting
their seriousness and enthusiasm
"has at once realized that an indeli
ble impression was being made in
these young souls. ,
" The scout oath isi.
"On my honor I will do my best.
' . , "1. To do my duty to God and
my country and to obey the scout
-, law. . I.-;,
"2. To help other people at all
times. - .," : : ,' , .'
"3. To keep myself physically
strong, mentally awake and moral
ly straight."
. The scout law isr ,
; I A scout is trustworthy.
2 A scout is loyal.
3 A scout is helpful.
4 A scout is friendly. '
5 A ecout is courteous.-
1 6 A scout is kind. . , , ' '
7 A scout is obedient. .
- 8 A, scout is cheerful.
' 9 A scout is thrifty.
10 A scout is brave , "
IX -A scout is clean.
12 A scout is reverent. j
The boy's- love for the out of
v doors, for hiking, camping and the
many other1 activities provided by
the movement makes it possible
for the trained scout master to win
bis respect and loyalty and to in
fluence his daijy life to a very re-
markable degree. The movement
'has been carefully thought out, is
well organized aud is growing rap
idy. There are now over 150,000
V Boy Scouts, and every month the
movement is taking root in new
, places. A campaign is on in Mem
phis to, raise' a sum .sufficient to
" support the work for .two years in
Memphis. It haB the indorsement
of ' the' superintendent of schools,
"of the chief of police-and many of
