HONOR AND SELF-RESPECT OF NATION
ARE AT STAKE HE WARNS CONGRESS
Full Text of President's Letter
to Senator Stone.
Washington, Feb. th.?President Wilson wrott to?
day to Senator Sto)tf. chairman of th? St note Foreign
Relations Committee, tu follows'.
".My Dear Senator: I very warmly appreciate your
kind and frank letter of to-day and feel that it cSlls for
an equally frank reply :
"You are rijrht In assuming that 1 shall do every?
thing in my power to keep the United States out of war.
1 think the country will feel no uneasiness about my
course in that respect. Through many anxious months
I have striven for that object, amidst difficulties more
manifold than can have been apparent upon the ?surface,
and so far I have succeeded. 1 do not doubt that I shall
continue io succeed. The course which the Central
European powers have announced their intention of fol?
lowing in the future with regard to undersea warfare
seems for the moment to threaten insuperable obstacles,
but its apparent meaning is so manifestly inconsistent
with explicit assurances recently given us by those
[lowers with regard'to their treatment of merchant ves?
sels on the high seas that I must believe that explana?
tions will presently ensue which will put a different
aspect upon it. We have had no reason to question their
good faith or their fidelity to their promises in the past,
and 1. for one. feel confident that we shall have none in
the future.
"But. in any event, our duty is clear. No nation,
no group of nations, has the right while war is in
progress to alter or disregard the principles which all
nations have agreed upon in mitigation of the horrors
and sufferings of war. and if the clear rights of Ameri?
can citizens should ever unhappily be abridged or denied
1 y any such action we should, it seems to me. have in
honor no choice as to what our own course should be.
"For my own part. I cannot consent to any abridg?
ment of the rights of American citizen! in any respect.
The honor and self-respect of the nation are involved.
We covet peace and shall preserve it at any cost but the
loss of honor. To forbid our people to exercise their
rights for fear we might be ?ailed upon to vindicate
them would be a deep humiliation indeed. It would be
an implicit, all but an explicit, acquiescence in the viola?
tion of the rights of mankind everywhere and of what?
ever nation or allegiance. It would be a deliberate abdi?
cation of our hitherto proud position as spokesmen, even
amidst the turmoil of war, for the law and the right. It
would make everything this government has attempted
and everything that it has achieved during this terrible
struggle of nations meaningless and futile.
"It is important to reflect that if in this instance we
allowed expediency Io take the place of principle, the
door would inevitably be opened to still further conces?
sions. ()nce accept a single abatemenl of right ami
many other humiliations would certainly follow, and
the whole tine fabric of international law might crumble
under our hands piece by piece. What we are contend?
ing for in this matter is of the very essence of the things
that have made America a sovereign nation. She cannot
yield them without conceding her own impotency as a
nation and making virtual surrender of her independent
position among the nations of the world.
"I .am speaking, my dear Senator, in deep solemnity,
without heat, with a clear consciousness of the high re?
sponsibilities of my office, and as your sincere and de?
voted friend. If we should unhappily differ, we shall
differ as friends, hut where issues so momentous as
those are involved we must, just because wc are friends,
>peak our minds without reservation. Faithfully yours.
"WOODROW WILSON."
.s? nator St our. in roncbidinq hit Irttrr t<> President
Wilson, said:
"I think you understand my personal attitude with
respect to this subject. A?s much and as deeply as 1
would hate to radically disagree with you. I find it diffi?
cult from my sense of duty and responsibility to consent
to plunge this nation into the vortex of this world war
because of the unreasonable obstinacy of any o? the
powers upon the one hand, or. on the other hand, of
foolhardiness, amounting to a sort of moral treason
against the Republic, of our people recklessly risking
their lives on armed belligerent ships. I cannot escape
the conviction that such would be so monstrous as to be
indefensible.
"1 want to be with you and to stand by you, and I
mean to do so up to the last limit, and I want to talk
with you ami Secretary Lansing with the utmost frank?
ness?to confer with you and have your judgment and
counsel?and I want to be kept advised as to the course
?if events, as it seems to me I am entitled to be. In the
meantime I am striving to prevent anything being done
by any Senator or member calculated to embarrass your
diplomatic negotiations. Up to the last you should be
left free to act diplomatically as you think for the best
to settle the questions involved. I need hardlv s:;> that
my wish is to help, not to hinder you."
