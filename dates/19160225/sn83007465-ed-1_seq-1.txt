FEARS CRISIS
IN AFFAIRS OF NAFION
Question of Armed Merchantmen
Absorbs Attention of
Both Houses.
DEMOCRATS DECIDE
TO MAKE CANVASS
win sound Sentiment of Body
and Report to President
With View to Securing
Expression on New
Decree of Central
Powers.
Washington, Feb. 23.?Agitation
in congress for action warning
Americans off armed ships
of European belligerents suddenly
grew to such proportions
today that the Democrats of the
\ foreign relations committee voted
to canvass the sentiment of
the house on several pending
resolutions of that nature.
Sentiment in the senate in favor
of some such action also
was openly expressed, but at the
end of a day of surprises, tension
and agitation such as had
not been seen in congress in some
time, the word came that President
Wilson still was unalterably
opposed to any such action
Dy congress and believed that
he would only be embarrassed
thereby in the negotiations with
Germany.
To widely circulated suggestions
that the situation had
reached a point where the president
would lay it before congress,
that Secretary Lansing
might in some way define the
attitude of the government in a
communication to Senator Stone
and that a time had been fixed
within which the United States
would expect Germany to signify
her intention to abandon the
announced plan to sink armed
merchant ships without warning
the statement was made officially
that nothing has been determin.
ed upon, and that the situation,
though grave, still was a waiting
one, that no final position would
be announced until Berlin was
heard from.
The sudden developments at
the capitol brought surprise to
the * administration leaders.
While confronted with the pos
siibility of congressional interference
with all its aspects ranging
from a defection from the
administration policy to downright
embarrassment of the
pra^ident and the secretary ot
state, the leaders were confident
they could control the situation
and leave the executive branch
of the government fre^to carry
on diplomatic negotiations with
Germany.
At no time today did the
question come out openly on the
floor of either the house or the
senate, but about a score of
congressmen who announced
they were in favor of warning
Americans, even if it involved a
repudiation of'the administration
policy, if thereby they
thought war would be averted,
kept both houses in a state of
tension that practically blocked
business.
All the demonstration was in
the Democratic ranks and there
was no open show of sentiment
among the Republicans. It was
indicated, however, that Republican
Leader Mann sympathized
with President Wilson's policy
and that any outbreak would
have to reckon with his forces.
From apparently authentic
sources came statements tonight
that the president was determined
that the dispute pending with
Germany be settled without prolonged
delay. He continues to believe
that the breaking off of
diplomatic relations with Germany
means war, and there will
be no undue haste in handling
the situation involving such a
possibility. The administration
view is that a broad and important.

SCORES ON MAN HUNT
IN SOUTH MOUNTAIN
I Charlie Mace of Burke County
Shoots Wife and Then Disappears.
Morganton, N. C., Feb.' 23.?
Another horrible tragedy has
been added to the already large
list of the South Mountain section
of this county, the wife of
Charlie Mace having been shot
to death by her husband, after
he had driven his terrified children
from the home Monday
night. Scores of men are hunting
Mace for whom a reward is offered.
As usual, the news was slow
in coming in from this section.
The children, it iis said, spent fne
night out of doors and a neighbor
was told Tuesday morning by
Mace that his wife had killed
j herself. Asked why he had not
notified anyone, he is reported
to have said that he didn't "want
anybody to know it."
The neighbor, however, notified
others and the officers were
informed. Sheriff Berry, Deputies
Hallman and Pipkin went
to the scene. Mace, seeing them
| .approach, armed himself heavily
: and left. A little later his doc
I was placed on his scent and Deputy
Pipkin caught sight of Mace
1 and fired on him once, but the
(officer's ffim wan nf UcrVif o
caliber to be effective at the
distance. Mace then disappeared
over a ridge and was gone.
The coroner's investigation
showed that the wound wa?
caused by a gunshot fired from a
greater distance than would have
been the case had there been a
suicide and that an attempt had
been made to fill the bullet hole
with flour. It was also in evidence
that Mace had threatened tc
kill his wife, and the children
i said that they had heard a scuffle
and a shot, although they did
not know that their mother was
dead until the next morning.
Sheriff Berry sent an automobile
back to town for more officers,
organized a small posse
nnd searched all of vestordav for
the fugitive. Last night lookout?
were posted on elevations when"
knowledge might be gained i1
Mace built a fire. At midnigh!
Sheriff Berry returned to Mor.
> canton for more men and enrh
rooming organised a ross<
of about 80, according to 'phone
messages.
