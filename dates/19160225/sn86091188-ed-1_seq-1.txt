but tiie science of choosing w hat to
cook that Miss Kelly spoke of to tiie
housewives gathered to hear lier In
planning tiie daily meal site said tnat
too much thought had been given to
the supposed necessity of providing
meats when • egetafiles and fruits
would better take their place. There j
is a tendency of American people to
eat loo much meat. For peuple en
gaged in ordinary work meat once a j
day is sufficient. Cheese, baked ;
beaus and eggs may well be sulisti- j
tuted. We should cultivate a taste if j
we have It not already for carrots,
spinach, cabbage, celery, as they give
hulk to tiie diet and supply many j
minerals and organic acids which j
keep the system in healthy condition, !
at the same time supplying the prop- [

The lecturer* left Salmon hedne»
day morning for sessions at Tendov.
They were highly gratified at the in
terest iiianilested in their work here
in this community. "For the first i
meeting of tiie kind ever held in a
place," said Director Center, "the
interest was remarkable and most
gratifying. He feel that our work Is
of value and worth while. H e shall
most certainly want to come again in
a more favorable season for travel.
I have found splendid conditions ap
parent here for the rapid develop
ment of various lines of work on the
farms. It is most wonderful that
you have none of the plagues of In
sects that in most localities destroy
or seflously injure iruits. Tuat gives

Your stock industry is great anil may
rapidly grow greater, as well as var

DESCRIBED AS FINE
DAIRY CATTLE HERD
GILMORE ACTIVE IN
MINING OPERATIONS
. 'Plie Hutte Miner has the following
to say about the recent large pur
chase by A. VV. Pipes of a herd of
Holstein dairy cuttle foi Salmon,
There are 101 head in tiie herd
and every one is full blood. Several
years ago the Hunch laud company
purchased ten fullblooded Holstein
cow* and hulls front Illinois and Wis
consin. It is from this stock that
the herd snrang. At that time the
cattle were considered the prize
bresds In tiie middle wester» states
. , . .
and they cost the company *.i.iu
company
head. It is seldom that a tired of
this kind Is to lie found anywhere,
as usually when a large numtier of
Icitfle are sold there are often some
[grade stock mixed with the bunch.
The herd has a reputation that ex
tends beyond the environs ol Mon
tana, and general regret lias been ex
pressed by cattle and dairy men here
, , , , .
tnat the stock has been permitted to
Chief,
«train,
gu to outsine people. The transfer
ring of this prize Holstein herd to
Idal hi will be a distinct loss to the
Montana dairy business.
Some time ago the Raiicliland com
pany disposed ol its ranch, consisting
of J.ooo acres, near (Iregson. The
company will give up laissemion on
March 1. The sale of the stock was
made to Mr. Pipes by Manager W. L.
ii vine of the company Lite other day.
hut it was not announced until this
morning.
BEST DAIRY STOCK.
The herd bull, * .Montana Hess
from the famous DeConigan
was raised by the Montana
Agricultural college at Huzemau.
The Holstein cattle are known as the
best dairy breed. They produce
more butter fat at a les» cost than
any other strain. They are superior
to other breeds, also, because the
steers make tiie finest kind of b, t.
During the years that the herd has
tieen in the possession of the Ha rich
land company frequent t»sts have
lieen made by the slate offVlals for
tulierculosis and other cattle disease*
There has never tieen a trace of
anv kind ot disease discovered in
these te»t». A rest made slme the
sale of Ute stock slows that every
now and hull Is sound.
A NEW INDUSTRY
Mr. Pljies stated while lure that
the dairy business in Salmon and
vicinity is in He infancy. A few
years ago a creamery was built there,
and it was riot until then that tiie
ranchers began to raise cattle for
dairy purposes. Before tnat time Un
stuck had Ls-en allowed to roa n the
range and they were rounded up
twice a year for branding and for »aie
as tieef cattle. Since toe establish
ment of the creamery * fe * blooded
bulls nave t«een brought In by sal
mon cattlemen, but they I it* ls-en
allowed to mingle with the grade
sfak. The herd widefi Mr Pipes
purchased will is- us'-d -tri t >* I r
dai-y purposes, and u is *.xj»» led
that the dairy business In the L- i hi
section wil lie built up in a few
y eirs to a high plane.

for the democracy. Mr. Day strong!v

The Mining World lias the 'follow
ing account of the recent gold dis
coveries ai < Hlmore :
Un the 2nd, Dan Mullen, a lea«ei
in the Silver D dlar claim of the
Pittsburg-Idaho Go., made a strike of
very rich gold ore while prospecting
,a ledge for lead-silver. Tee ledge I»
In limestone, .1 to 5 feel wide, and
the ore, decomposed material nninly
iron and tnangaucsel ondes. Free
gold is conspicuous throughout tiie
mass and the samples run high in
gold with but an ounce ol silver ami
a trace of lead. Till* is the first
body of strictly gold ore encountered
in the Fittsburgli-ldaho, though
that mine has lieen a consistent »hip
per tor years of crude lead-silver ores
carrying up to *1 per ton iu gold
This strike resembles that made in
the Aille Mine adjoining, a few years
ago, from which several curs of *500
gold ore were shipped, as well a* sev
eral thousand ton* ol medium grade
After a in on Ui of un usually severe
weather during which rail Ir.mspor
talion was entirely suspended over
the Gilmore A Pittsburg railroad 1«*
tween Gilmore and Leadore, the line
is again iqten, and accumulated ore
lu the amount of I Ü00 tons is tieiiig
rapidly loaded and forwarded to
smelters.
At It is time the Lemhi Union
bus, after J years period of develop
ment, again jollied the column ot
regular shippers. Two carloads of
ore giving assay returns of 55 to 6o
per cent lead and 50 ounces »II »er are
now enroule to Salt Luke smelters
Iront this property. Renewal ot
shipment* from the Lemhi Union
will undoubtedly stimulate the devel
opment of other properties In the
Spring Mountain district lids y*ar
A considerable Increase in develop
ment both In the Texas and Spring
Mon'ain districts is looked lui with
the advent ot spring.
