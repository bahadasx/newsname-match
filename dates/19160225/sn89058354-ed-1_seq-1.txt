PREPARATION OF LAND
FOR SPRING OAT CROP
Falling Temperature On Wed
nesday Blasts Hopes For
Early Plowing
WHEAT CROPS DAMAGED BY
MANY WEATHER CHANGES
Gardens Will Be Put Out When
Temperature Rises Again;
Too Wet For Plowing
Farmers who were getting
ready to prepare their land for
the sowing of spring oats had
their hopes blasted Tuesday af
ternoon when a cool rain set in.
The temperature continued to
fall and the rain kept up through
COLD
Wednesday night.
The wheat crop in the county
is not looking very good, having
been damaged considerably by
the frequent freezes and thaws.
' However, a few weeks of good
weather now would bring it out
considerably a-
When the temperature moder
ates again gardens will be pre
pared and early frost-proof cab
. bage plants and onions will be
set out
Gardeners and truck growers
expect to have their early vege
tables out long before Good Fri
day this year, which falls on
April 21, provided the weather
moderates and the rains cease.
Very little spring plo wing
probably less than in years has
been done in Henry county as
yet because the ground has been
, too wet for plowing since late
November. For this reason
work will be rushed by the far
mers as soon as the weather will
permit.

RYE ASKED
TO HELP IN
MAN HUNT
Many citizens of Paris and
Henry county have signed a pe
tition to Gov. Rye asking him to
offer a reward of $50.00 for the
capture of Bert Hawkins, alias
Greer, negro, who shot and beat
his wife to death here several
if- months ago. If a reward is of
?.fered it is believed that the ne
gro may be found. He fled on
the night of the murder, and of
ficers have been unable to locate
him. The report a few days ago
that Hawkins had been captured
was a mistake.

BeneathBody of Hog
On Sam Love's Lot
Hold Jim and Sam
Love As Accessories
After Fact In Con
nection With Crime.
Buried beneath a pile of refuse
from the stable, the , body of
Josie Pryor, negress, was dis
covered by a party of searchers
Sunday afternoon at the rear of
the barn of Sam Love on Brewer
street, and with the body and
upon it was found that of a dead
hog.
Shortly after the removal of
the negress' body from the
ground, officers, arrested Sam
Love, step-father of Tom Barr,
who was being held on suspicion
in connection with the woman's
disappearance, as an accessory,
and a little later Jim Love, broth
er of. Sam i and who had been with
Barr on the night the' negress
disappeared, was ' also arrested.
Both were immediately locked up
in the county jail.
Justice W. T. Snow empaneled
a coroner's jury at the scene of
the discovery and they began
taking evidence at once.
The Pryor woman wa3 last
eeen alive on the night of Febru
ary 12th. She was in the com
pany of Barr, with whom she had
been going for a long while, at
the time. A number of negroes
say that he had often threatened
her with death before that time.
On Tuesday of last week Barr
was arrested and placed in jail.
He denied his guilt, but suspicion
was so strong that at the prelim
inary hearing two days later he
was held to await the action of
the next grand jury.
In the meantime searching
parties were scouring the county
in an effort to locate the body of
the missing woman. -The search
ers looked in every place where
it seemed possible that the body
might have been hidden, dragged
Russell's lake and all ponds and
pools of water about Paris, but
discovered nothing.
Friday or Saturday a reward of
$50.00 was offered by the woman's
relatives for the discovery of her
body, and the hunt was continued
with renewed interest and ex
citement. However, the searching parties
had almost despaired of success
when one of them came upon a
pile of stable refuse behind the
Love negro's barn Sunday. In
vestigation proved that there was
some fresh earth in the pile, and
believing that they were about to
solve the mystery of the Pryor
woman's disappearance they at
once began digging into the pile.
First the body of the hog was
unearthed, and just beneath this
in mud and water wa3 found the
missing woman.
Among those in the party dis
covering the body were Sam Mc
Gehee and a number of negroes.
As. soon as they found that the

PARISIAN
After Making Written
Confession Tom Barr
Attempts Suicide As
Sheriff and Deputies
Make Ready Defense
of Jail Against Gang
Would-be Lynchers.
With an angry mob jamming
the streets for a block in every
direction from the county jail,
Tom Barr, held on suspicion,
wrote and signed a statement
confessing that he murdered
Josie Pryor, negress, and then
hanged himself in his cell Sun
day night, following the finding
of his victim's body and the ar
rest of Jim and Sam Love.
Prisoners in adjoining cells
heard him strangling and shout
ed for the officers, who cut Barr
down just in time to save his life.
He used his belt in attempting
SufJfde- and it required half an
hour or longer for physicians to
bring him back to consciousness.
Until a late hour Sunday night
the mob surrounded the jail,
while Sheriff T. M. Hagler and a
half dozen deputies stood guard.
The confession was shown to
the coroner's jury on Monday,
and later Barr discussed the
crime with the members of the
jury. While not implicating the
Love negroes, it is said that Barr
declared that he did not bury the
hog, dug up with the Pryor
woman's body, but declared that
he buried the body where it was
found. His statement is regard
ed as an attempt to shield the
Love negroes, as five or six wit
nesses contradict his statement.
"I killed her because I loved
her," Barr told the members of
the jury and the officers, it is
understood.
Again about 10 o'clock Monday
night a mob of twenty-five or
thirty men showed up before the
jail, but dispersed when the of
ficers on guard made it clear that
they intended to defend the
prisoners.
The preliminary trial of the
Loves was set for Tuesday after
noon, but was postponed until
Friday, because, it is said, some
feared that an attempt might be
made to take the negroes from
the officers if 'they were brought
from the jail. Both deny any
connection with the crime, it is
said, although the coroner's jury
reported that Josie Pryor came
to her death at the hands of Tom
Barr and that Jim and Sam Love
were accessories after the fact.
According to Barr's confession
to the officers, he used a machin
ists hammer to murder the
woman, it is said.
Both white and colored citizens
are .very much aroused over the
horrible crime and the conceal
ing of the body, and if it had not
been for wise counsel from older
citizens it is probable that an at
tempt to break into the jail would
have been made.'

L GAME GETS
ESTENG; COUNTY
TO FILL
State Contests Will Also Take
Shape Following Meet of
State Committee
WELDON AND BROWNING ARE
ONLY LEGISLATIVE ENTRIES
Rye May Be Opposed; Reeves
and Walsh To Seek Gus
Enloe's Position
Following the meeting of the
Democratic State Committee at
Nashville tomorrow, the political
game will take on added interest
and the state races will begin to
form, and a call for the Henry
county committee is also expect
ed in the near future when meth
ods for nominating a candidate
for direct representative will be
decided upon.
As yet Gov. Rye has no oppo
sition for the gubernatorial nom
ination, although Judge Sidney
J. Everett, of Jackson." is being
groomecl Jby..his friendsv. Judge
Everett will announce his- inten
tions in regard to the race in the
near future, it is expected.
B. A. Enloe, West Tennessee
member of the Railroad Commis
sion, will likely have strong op
position should he stand for re
election. Homer Reeves, of
Union City, one of the most pop
ular traveling salesmen in the
State, is a probable candidate for
this position, and if he shies his
lid into the ring friends in prac
tically every county will get be
hind him. Mr. Reeves has al
ways taken an active interest in
the political game, contributing
both time and money to the
Democratic campaigns, but has
never been a candidate for office.
He would probably have the solid
support of the Ninth Congression
al district, unless Thos. J. Walsh,
.of Humboldt, former state sena
tor, should get into the fight.
In the event of Mr. Walsh's
entrance into the contest the
Ninth district would be split be
tween Reeves and Walsh.
Col. Enloe may be a candidate
for reelection but it is not consid
ered likely that very many of the
old-line Democrats will fall in
line for him because of his for
mer support of Hooper. How
ever, it is impossible to say just
what may happen.
Dudley Porter, of Paris, Dor
sey B. Thomas, of Camden, and
Judge T. W. Sims, of Linden,
are announced candidates for
Congress and this promises to be
one of the most spirited races
ever seen in this district.
Col. W. E. Weldoh is the only
announced candidate for the
State Senate, although Claude
Bushart and G. L. Fryer are
probable contestants for this po
sition. Thos. J. Browning is the only
entry in the race for Representa
tive, since the withdrawal of
Nathan D. White, although G.
R. Baucum, Henry Jones, J. J.
Thompson, Jr., Sam A. Green
and others have been mentioned.

STEPS MAY BE TAKEN
BY COUNTY COURT TO
SETTLE CUNTI
Member of Bar Says Officials
Could Not Hold Over If
Road Act Is Killed
THINKS IT QUESTION FOR
HIGH COURT TO SETTLE
Should Law Be Declared Re
pealed Commissioners Will
Automaticly Go Out
If the Robertson and Haywood
county road act repealed the
Henry county statute, the local
roadicommissioners and supervis
ors could not hold over under the
old law merely because no at
tempt had been made to carry
out the repealing act, according
to one of the members of the
Paris bar.
This attorney declared that if
the Henry county statute was
knocked out by the other act
that the commissioners and su
pervisor automatically lost their
positions at that time. He said
that the section relied upon by
the commissioners to sustain the
old law the section published in
The Parisian last week would
seem to hold both ways in re
gard to the repeal, that it was a
kind of wheel-within-a-wheel,
and was a question for the
courts to determine.
As the commissioners are not
going to take any steps to test
the law, it is probable that the
matter will be brought before
the county court at the next
regular meeting of that body.
The members of the court will
likely be asked to have the act
tested.
Many are saying that if the
law is repealed that the Robert
son and Haywood county law
should be put in operation, and
they will anxiously await the ac
tion of the April term of the
county court.
