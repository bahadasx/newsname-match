DOUBLE SHOOTING
On Friday night about 12:30
the highlife section of Lordsburg
was aroused to a state of excite
ment, when A. T. Salazar, well
known in pugilistic circles, and
who has been here for the last
seven months, shot a girl, "Tom
my," and then put a bullet through
his own brain. The shooting was
done outside the house. The girl
was shot in the head and received
a second shot through the left
shoulder from behind, the bullet
penetrating just above the heart.
The girl lives, but "Sal" expired
instantly. An inquest was held
at the house by the coroner, C. W.
Marselas, and a verdict that Sala
zar came to his death by a pistol
shot fired by his own hand, was
returned.
The pistol used to end his exis
tence was a 38 double action. Sal
azar was 26 years of age. He had
learned the trade of a boilermaker
at Albuquerque, where his mother
lives. He was also a U. S. soldier,
and a barber. About two weeks
ago he, with George Mullarkey,
purchased the pressing and clean
ing business of Floyd.
Mrs. Salazar, mother of the dead
man, arrived in Lordsburg Tues
man, arrived in Lordsburg on Sun
day and made arrangements for
the burial of her son, who was in
terred here. He was an only child,
his father having died ten years
ago.
This is the third occurrence
whereby attempted murder and
suicide has taken place here
About a year ago Charlie Reed
fired a shot into the head of a
woman of the underworld and
turned the gun upon himself,
dying before aid could reach him
and the woman surviving. A
year before that in the same
house a like killing occured.
ANOTHER FIRE TRAP
A temporary frame . business
house is to be built next week on
the lot between the Star Theatre
and Mrs. Stevens' confectionery
store. It was generally hoped
that a substantial brick would be
built on the lot but owing to the
diminutive finances of the owner
a temporary building Í3 to be
constructed.
THE LIBERAL UP
TO THE MINUTE
One of the most marvelous in
ventions of the age, the linotype, is
nM-missinir in the roll call of the
the up-to-the-minuto progress of
the Western Liberal. Since Aug
ust of last year practically all of
the news composition in this paper
And a large number of the adver
tisements have been set on this al
most human machine and on the
latest model manufactured by the
Mergenthaler linotype Company
the Model 14. This wonderful
machine is installed in the office
of the Deming Headlight and is
used under contract by the Liber
al, giving this office the best of
composition facilities the printing
world provides. Without leaving
his seat, the operator of the Model
14 linotype is able to set any char
acter of newspaper or job work,
having at his disposal four sizes of
type, of seven faces. Much of the
Western Liberal's job work, with
intricate ruling, etc., has been
turned out by this marvel as well
s the paper, its headings, ads, etc.
It is the use of the linotype that
gives the Liberal its clear print
and reduces costs so that we can
give the readers one of the best
country newspapers in the south
west :

COONTOWN MINSTRELS

When it is taken into considera
tion that the parties composing the
Lordsburg Coontown minstrels
have been working hard for the
past three months to perfect their
entertainment which will be pre
sented to the public on Saturday

that they are giving the very best
that there is in them. Everybody

ly. SHERIFF STEPHENS KILLED
IN BATTLE WITH OUTLAWS
Dwight B. Stephens, sheriff of
Luna county, and Joe Cranson, who
was serving a jail sentence here
for vagrancy, were killed, and De
puty Sheriff "Buck" Sevier and J.
0. Starr, a burglary suspect, were
seriously wounded in a battle be
tween a posse and escaped prison
ers from Deming jail a mile and
half west of Rincón, Dona Ana
county, shortly after noon on Sun
day. Cranson and Starr and three
other prisoners escaped from the
Deming jail by overpowering jailor
Tabor Sunday morning and start
ed out, well armed, in a Ford auto
mobile. It was an hour after the escape
if the five prisoners before the de
livery was discovered, and then
Sheriff Stephens, Deputies Sevier
and John Kelly, Marshal Tabor
and several others started in pur
suit with an automobile. They
caught up with the prisoners short
ly after noon, the latter having
just stopped to eat lunch after
crossing a hill east of Deming. The
officers were doubtful about get
ting their car over the hill, due to
the condition of the road and Ta
bor got out and walked to the top
of the grade to make an inspection.
As he looked over the ridge he saw
the bandits only a few yards away,
and at once called to the other of
ficers. The minute Deputy Sheriff
Sevier reached the top of the hill
he yelled to the men below to throw
up their hands, but instead they
opened fire. Sheriff Stephens fell
dead.
According to reports of the f ieht
between the sheriff's posse and the
fleeing prisoners, Stephens was
slain before he had a chance to fire
a shot, a bullet from a rifle in
the hands of one of the
prisoners, fired at close range, en
tering his right shoulder and pass
ing through his lungs, causing al
most instant death. He fell for
ward, his cocked gun being found
under his body.
Buck Sevier, a member of the
posse, was shot in the head, but not
seriously wounded, the ballet
grazing his skull. Joe Cranson,
one of the escaped prisoners, was
killed during the fight between the
officers and criminals, and J. O.
Starr, another member of the gang,
badly wounded. Three other pris
oners made their escape from the
rain of leaden bullets from the pos
se men, who then, for the time be
ing, turned their attention to the
tvo victims of the posse, Stephens
and Sevier.

CLEAN-UP AT IIACIIITA

week in Hachita, being called there
to take up a number of violations
of the law.
George Carlson was arrrigned
before Justice of the peace James
Robson charged with having shot
and killed Tony Metrik on Satur
day night in the course of a brawl
that started in the local red light
district. Both Carlson and Met
rik were privates in a cavalry regi
ment on patrol on the border. The
shooting was done with a U. S.
service rifle. Carlson was held
for the grand jury without bail and
was taken to Silver City to be held
n the county jail.
Charles Parks was also brought
before Judge Robson, charged with
assault with intent to kill on the
person of Dude Cheney. "This af

some money that Cheney claimed
was due, and Parks picked up a
sledge hammer and hurled it at
Cheney,' striking him in the face
and breaking several bones. Parks
was held for the grand jury in
$2000 bond, which was furnished.
Charged with having stolen a
beef belonging to W. J. Wamel, W.

bound over to the grand jury in
the sum of $2000 each. The arrest

his district.

Lordsburg Wins at Basket Ball
Although there was quite a wind
blowing last Saturday morning,
the game between the Lordsburg
and Clifton basket ball teams came
off, with the honors 13 to 6 in the
locals' favor. The game was fast
and showed quite good team work,
especially on the part of the Lords
burg gris. The scores would have
been larger if the wind had not
blown the balls from the goal
The victory brings great joy to the
school, because of the fact the local
team has three sixth graders on
the lineup, and the Clifton team
is composed of high school stu
dents only.
The line up was:
CLIFTON LORDSRURG

Everybody Keep the Home Dol
lar Moving PaycUp Week
IN one of the ray-Up Week campaigns in a western city un
ordinary silver dollar whs labeled "The limine Dollar." Every
body was asked to keep it moving, not to send it out of town,
and to report to whom he paid it. Everybody was surprised how
busy that little round dollar was. It piikl hundreds of dollar debts
and finally got back where it started. If oue dollar kept in circu
lation at home can do so much for a community, what if all the
'dollars are kept busy that way? Think it over.
If you have $50 in your pocket and you owe $50 you know that
the $50 you have in your pocket is not rightfully yours. If you
cannot o (lord to pay nil of the $50 that you owe at least pay part
of it. If you think that when you have money and you owe it
you have a right to retain it until you are good and ready to pay,
men who owe you money have a right to think the same way.
IT IS THIS GENERAL PROPOSITION THAT PAY-UP WEEK
SECKS TO REMEDY. IF YOU PROMISE A MERCHANT. IF YOU
PROMISE A FRIEND, TO MAKE GOOD A CERTAIN SUM ON A CER
TAIN DATE YOU SHOULD MEAN WHAT YOU SAY. A MAN WHO
WOULD NOT THINK OF BREAKING A SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT
WILL BREAK A FINANCIAL ENGAGEMENT OR PROMISE ANO
THINK NOTHING OF IT. FOR YEARS IT HAS BEEN CONSIDER
ED ALL RIGHT TO TAKE YOUR TIME PAYING A DEBT.
This theory is nil wrong. Puy-Up Week is a start in a general
remedial plan. If worked out properly it will prove one of the best
things that this community ever has had.
DON'T TAKE LIGHTLY THUS PAY-UP WEEK.
It means much to the community.
