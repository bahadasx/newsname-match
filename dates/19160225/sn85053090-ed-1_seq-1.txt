As previously announced in
these columns another meeting'
was held at the Botner school
house last Saturday for the pur
pose of advancing 1 the negotia
tions previously started and to
entertain any new features that
might have developed in connec
tion with securing the Beaver
Valley railroad to Ekalaka. Not
withstanding the fact the roads
were in wretched condition and
much high water was encounter
ed by many, the attendance \v: s
unexpectedly large.
Baker, Mill creek, Willard, Min
nesota Va'ley, Wells schooi house,
Webster, Bishor, Knobs, Cook's
school house, Ekalaka. Beaver
Flats, Chalk Buttes and other
Beaver Valley points were ail
s tron gl y represented.
The large crowd had a tenden
cy to renew and strengthen the
enthusiasm and everyone appear
ed hopeful and optimistic. The
activities previously started by
the Botner- Webster settlement
were taken as a nucleus for a
more comprehensive and busi
ness* like organization.
A permanent organization was
formed, a chairman and secre
tary elected, and various commit
tees appointed. Resolutions set
ting forth the purposes of the
organization were read and adopt
ed, after which a general ex
change of ideas on the chief sub
ject was engaged in.
Much interest was awakened
by the concern shown from ai
entirely new quarter, that is, the:
Milwaukee railroad. This com
pany was represented by Mr. E.
L. Earling who came direct from
headquarters. Mr. Earling made
a clear and comprehensive talk
to those assembled stating that
his Company was much interest
ed and that he would be pleases
to meet the committee and
formulate a plan for further con
sideration of the matter.
After adjournment the com
mittee met with Mr. Earling and
indicated to him that the people
would be pleased to co-operate
and assist in a suitable manner
toward securing a road and that
the committee would cheerful'.,,
deal with the Milwaukee on the
same footing as with any other
company.
Mr. Earling requested that the
committee secure data relative
to existing and prospective bus
iness and he assured the com
mittee that any efforts made to
word interesting his company b:

also the arrangement for the or

the ofn.';\ After all of the ex
panses incurred had been paid it
was found that the sum of

that surely repaid the boys well !
for their efforts.

Full Seven Months Residence
Required During Each Year
Commissioner of General Land Office Hands Out Decision
That "Off Ag 'in, On Ag 'in" Practice of Many
Homesteaders Will Not be acceptable.
A decision has been rendered
by the Secretary of the Interior
in case of a proof under the three
year law, which is very import
ant to every homesteader ex
pecting to make similiar proof.
Josehine M. Locher, a school
teacher, on December 31, 1910
made homestead entry under the
ordinary five-year law, and began
actual residence June 8, 1911.
Her three year proof was ad
vertised to be made June 12
1914, the three year law having
in the meantime been enacted,
and she choosing to make proof
thereunder. Her proof was pro
tested by a third party and the
evidence given showed that Miss
Locher had taught school eight
een miles fre»m her homestead
during the winters of '11-12, '12
13 and '13-14; that 'she had gone
to her claim on Friday evenings
or Saturday mornings, returning
Sunday afternoons during such
terms of teaching and had spent
the summers on her claim, ex
cept six weeks in 1-911 when she
attended a summer session of the
University of Chicago and for
three weeks of 1912 when she
was in Portland having her eyes
treated. Her evidence showed
good faith in that she had ex
pended fully $1,200 on her claim,
that all her improvements were
good, and indicated they were
made with the intentions of de
veloping a permanent home. Her
house was good and well furnish
ed; her garden was fenced with
rabbit-proof wire; she had plant
ed trees, and several varieties of
berries; she had cultivated 40
acres in 1912, 80 in 1914 and 100
seeded in the fall of 1911. The
proof was, however rejected for
insufficient residence. It was
held that the law requiring 7
months of actual residence upon
the land meant that the claimant
should actually reside upon the
land the full seven months.
It seems to have been conclud
ed that the law allowing five
months of constructive residence
was liberal enough and that seven
months must actually be put in
with daily residence upon the
land, but that all absence of a
few days, such as might occur in
this section of the country in tak
ing stock to market and such
other common sense absence as
that, or an occasional visit of a
day or two at a time, would not
militate against the proof of the
homesteader.
The decision concludes: "In the

case at bar, Miss Locher had the
benefit of the five months' leave
of absence per year permitted by
law, and during the remaining
seven months, she admits that
she did not maintain her actual
residence upon the land. She
agrees she could not have done
so and taught school eighteen
miles away, returning to the land
each night and going to her duties
each morning, that this would
have been impossible.
"While she has abundantly
proven her good faith by her im
provements and cultivation, of
which the Department is fully
convinced; yet, as stated, seven
months actual residence each
year for three years has ne>t been
shown, and, therefore, the final
proof submitted cannot be ac
cepted.
"The entry will remain intact,
subject to submission of further
proof, which may, in this case,
be made or after the expiration
of five years from date of entry.
Or three year proof may be made
by a showing that she has culti
vated the land and resided there
on for seven months each year
for three years."
It will be seen that, unless Miss
Locher went upon the land after
she submitted proof in 1914, that
she could not make her 21 months
residence in three separate years
before her limit of time of five
years would expire, and that,
therefore, she would have lost her
claun except for the fact that it,
j was entered under the five year
! law (three year law having pas
jSedJuneO, 1912), for want of
j time to make the seven months a
year for three years. Homestead
ers under the three year law can
Snot be too careful in regard to
j giving the full seven months res
idence each year for three years.
