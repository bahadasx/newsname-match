WAS A SOCIAL
SUCCESS
Washington's Birthday Ball
Proved a Banner Event in a
Social Way-Many Appear
ed in Costume.
The Washington's birthday
ball given at the I. O. 0. F. hall
Tuesday evening by the Pythian
Sisters lodge was perhaps the
grandest affair of its kind ever
given in Cottonwood. The fea
ture of the evening was the ap
pe srance on the c 1 ance flc or of
many couples dressed in ^old co
lonial style, the ladies gowned in
flowing gowns and wearing pow
dered wigs and beauty patches
cn their fair faces, while the
men wore knee pants and the
old style waistcoats liberally dec
orated with ruffles. Mr. and
Mrs. T. J. Parker appeared as
George and Martha Washington
and acted the parts to perfec
tion. The grand march led by
those in costume was a very
pleasing sight and drew many
complimentary remarks from
those i resent. The music pro
vided by the Reubens orchestra
was all one could wish and the
oyster supper served at the
Funke restaurant seemed to
meet with universal approval.
The dance lasted unt 1 the wee
hours of the morning and was a
most enjoyable affair, both for
the dancers and those who only
went to look on.
Casady Gets Fee of $1750
The trial in the case of W. H.
Stuart of Kooskia was commenc
ed Wednesday and the evidence
in the case was put in by even
ing. The case was argued this
morning and went to the jury
about noon. A verdict was
brought in about four o'clock
this afternoon, the jury award
ing the sum of $1750. The ver
dict was signed by 11 of the jur
ors, so that the same was practi
cally unanimous. This case was
closely contested, Judge James
F. Ailshie appearing as counsel
for Mr. Casady, and Attorney
Clay McNamee, of Lewiston, and
United States District Attorney
J. L. McClear, of Boise, jointly
defending the case for Stuart.
The suit grew out of the refus
al to pay the amount demanded
by Mr. Casady in defending an
Indian heirship case before the
Department of the Interior, and
as a result of which services,
about $25,000 worth of property
came to Mr. Stuart, through the
inheritmce of an adopted daugh
ter, Viola Allen, who died some
time before the commencement
of the action and after the adop
tion by the Stuarts. The Stuarts
claimed right to inheritance to
the estate of their adopted
daughter at her death. A ques
tion also arose concerning the
right of Viola Allen to inherit
from some of her blood relatives
after the formal adoption. These
questions after submission to the
Secretary of the Interior were
decided in Mr. Stuart's favor.
A reasonable fee was to be
charged according to the agree
ment between attorney and cli
ent and the disagreement ended
in the litigation just concluded.—

Gave A Swell Party
One of the swellest affairs of
the season was given Tuesday at
the G. F. McKinney home in this
city, when Mrs. McKinney was
at home to a number of her lady
friends from the hour of two to
five. The rooms were elaborately
decorated in the national colors,
and the lights and numerous
candles were decorated with red
shades in the form of rose petals.
The guests looked very charming
in powdered hair and patches
and costumes of old colonial de
sign. Mrs. Elvin Parker looked
especially charming in her gown
of yellow satin, and carried off
the prize. The best American
flag was made by Mrs. Thomas
Parker, who received the second
prize. Later a dainty three
course luncheon was served by
the hostess, assisted by Mrs. F.
S. Simon, cafeteria style, the
ladies marching to the strains of
music provided by the Victrola.
The guests on leaving voted Mrs.
McKinney an ideal hostess.

of barb wire and nails. The autos
were unloaded yesterday and the
work of placing them with resi

' There Are Others
Don't imagine,- my boy, if you throw up your job
That the firm that employed you will fail;
That the whole office forceln their anguish will sob
And the senior partner turn pale,
You are highly efficient and active and bright,
So you say, I'm unwilling to doubt you;
But the chance of all this is incredibly slight,
There are plenty of others without you.
Don't get mad with the girl, and to make her feel bad
Fail to go for your usual call.
It's the truth, though I know it sounds awfully sad
That she may never miss you at all.
It's a mighty poor policy staying away,
Though I grant that at times she may flout you,
But I know I'm in a position to say,
There are plenty of others without you.
Don't get sore on the world and do anything rash,
Not to speak of the good of your soul,
If you jump in the lake you make a small splash,
But you'll never leave much of a hole.
Don't expect folks to make such a terrible fuss,
When they think very little about you,
And to use common language, aren't caring a cuss;
There are plenty of others without you.
—Edmund Vance Cook.

Another Farm Sale
Casper Wensmann this week
purchased the Wm. Schremp
farm of 101 acres just north of
town for $85 an acre, also buying
the livestock and machinery from
Mr. Schremp and the house that
was erected on the place late last
fall. The farm lies just across
the road from Mr. Wensmann's
place and is an ideal addition to
his present holdings. Mr.
Schremp has not decided just
where he will locate next but in
tends going to the coast next
week to look over that country.
A bouncing baby daughter was
born Wednesday night to Mr.
and Mrs. C. W. Nuxoll northwest
of town. It is the fourth child
in the family but Willie wears

miss as he did for the first son
and heir. Dr. Shinnick was the
attending physician.

Spring Manure-Handling
If that manure pile is to be
used on the coming crop, the
more quickly it is put on the land,
the better. Don't haul it over
the fields, however, while it is so
wet the wheels cut deeply. Gar
dens should be supplied with a
liberal dressing of manure and
should be well worked later.
Gardening is intensive cropping
and there is usually no adequate
rotation with legumes, so that
the fertility must be restored in
manure. Pastures will respond
to a medium dressing of fine ma
nure. For most crops do not
make heavy applications. Ten
tons to the acre is usually enough.
So far as possible, make a prac
tice of hauling out the manure as
made, that is, every two or three
days.
Get Five Cougar
Frank Jones and Phil Schooler
returned Saturday afternoon
from the Big Island country,
where they had spent the past
two months hunting cougar,
bringing with them five hides,
three of which were old ones and
two young ones, the latter being
about two thirds grown. Two of
the old ones measured about nine
feet each from tip to tip and are
as fine specimens as have ever
been brought in.
They have succeeded in bring
ing in nine fine hides within the
past two years.—Genesee News.
The Rev. A. J. Tiffany left for
Clarkston, Wash., Tuesday morn

Grain prices are pretty badly
shot to pieces again this week,
probably due to the action df the
German government in declaring
submarine warfare after March
1st on all armed merchantmen
without notice, and as a result
wheat has dropped down to the
86 cent mark and the market is
very shaky, while both oats and
barley are several points below
the market of the past' two
weeks. In fact, it is hard to get
any kind of quotations on wheat
and it is possible the price will
encounter further slumps before
reaching a steady base.
