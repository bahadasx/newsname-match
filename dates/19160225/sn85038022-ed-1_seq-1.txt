"Wo havo not reason to question
tho central powers' good faith or their
fidelity to their promises in tho past,1
he added, "and I for one, feel confl
dent that we shall have none in tho
future."
Tho letter was in answer to one
written Into this afternoon by Senator

Representntlvo Flood, chairman of tho
