German troops taking part In the
operations were given to understand
that this was to be the last and greatest
offensive against France, according
to statements made by prisoners.
The following phrase is quoted from
an order published by General von1
Deluding on the eve of the Verdun
battle:
."In the course of the last offensive

given signal, every infantryman and
gunner took the post assigned to him

attack were gone through behind

Every inch of ground was
searched out; every point where It
. was thought a gun position might exist
was littered with shells, but tne
French infantry was so well sheltered
and the French guns so well hidden
that when the German batteries grew
