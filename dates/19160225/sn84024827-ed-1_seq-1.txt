case a bond issue should be elected
for that purpose. I
Public roads are for the purposes of
providing transportation routes for
the people in all communities, an-
sbline them to communicate with peo-J
pie in other communities, commercial- i
ly and socially, and for the pronation
of civilization and the development of
settlements and the building or homes.
Never for the purpose of serving self
ish interests alone, whether it be com
munity or individual.'
The promotion of the bond issue
for pood roads in Cochise county
should be placed on such a plane,
purged of any self motive, or indivt
.dual interest.
In the first place the 525 miles of
road planned by the Road Bond As
sociation to be constructed at an esti
mated cost of $1,210,255.00, to use the
county engineer's exact figures, is to
be nothing more than a tentative
foundation for 525 miles of road to be
constructed at some future time if we
ever have a system of permanent
roads. The business principle involv
ed may be illustrated by imagining a
man who expects to trtiiid a house, and
having enough money lo complete a
modest, comfortable home, decides to
put. ALL his money into a foundation
for an elaborate mansion, the super
structure to be built at some future
time if he happens to ever get enough
money to complete it. To be more
definite, if the system contemplated
and urged by the Road Bond Associa
tion is carried out, Cochise county
will have 525 miles of country road
augmented by bridges and partial con
struction of roads in the law parts of
the country connected by the same
country roads on the higher ground,
with a better system of drainage than
we have at present. In the language
of our county engineer expressed at
meetings of both the Bond Association
and the Taxpayers, bis estimate mere
ly contemplated bridges, drainage, and
repairs of the roads, taking into con
sideration all the roads on high ground
with nothing more than drainage to
be done on them. This statement is
made from an understanding of state
ments made by the county engineer
and his confirmation, or correction is
admissible. I j
The Cochise County Taxpayers' As
sociation proposed a system of Trunk
Lines, one main line from the New
Mexico line running west through
Douglas, Bisbee, Tombstone, St. Dav
id, Benson, to the Pima county line:
another beginning at Willcox and run
ning south through the Sulphur Sprins
valley to the point of
divergance, .
where one branch of it turns west to
ward Bisbee. the other branch south
east toward Douglas, each town being
the same milage from ' the point of
divergance. This road skirts the
western part of the settlements, leav
ing more of the farming population on
the east side of the road than on the sey was joiled at Las Vegas on a
west side or it. The connections with charge of murder in connection with
the north end of the central trunk j the death or Clyde Wiggins, foreman

EAGLES 10 BUILD
STREET
Local Fraternal Organization
Will Start Erection of Struc
ture on Costello Lot Within
Sixty Pays.
A ten year lease, with an option to
buy the property at the end of that
time, has been taken on th Costello
let. on Upper Main Street, by the Bis
bee Aerie of Eagles and within sixty
days the erection of a $15,000 home is
expected to be under way.
For some months the Eagles have
been casting about for a suitable loca
tion for a ho-re. After much investi
gation on the part of a special com
mittee, appointed for that purpose, the
lease on the Costello lot was secured.
Though plans have not been perfected
for the structure the next few days
will see active work done and before;
the sixty day period is completed the
lodge will have let the contract for
the new building.
According to the temporary plans
the first floorwill be made into a thea
tre, seating 1.000 people. From this
floor the Eagles expect to derive a
very considerable revenue which will
enable the lodge, before the lease ex
pires, to purchase the property on
which the building will stand.
The Eagles lodge Is one of the most
prosperous an dactive fraternal organ
izations in the Warren District. When
the building on the O. K. block site
was contemplated the Eagles were
handling a third and when that project
failed to materialize the members de
cided that the lodge, of itself, would
have a home within a very short peri
od.
To raise the money, in part for the
construction of the home. the Eagles
have entered into a contract with the
Camnbell's United Shows to play in
the Warren District for one week, be
ginning March 6. Al Fisher, advance
agent of the big carnival company is
now in Bisbee making all arrange
ments for the appearance. One of the
features of the week's attraction will
be a Queen contest and it is expected
this mill attract a large share or at

Some Plain Facts Given in
Convincing Manner.
DESIRES TO KEEP
U. S. OUT OF WAR.
But Cannot Allow Expedien
cy Take the Place of Princi
pie. "Few Are Know Who
Wish to Haul Down Flag."
WASHINGTON, Feb. 24. The
President at the end of two days
of agitation in Congress on action
warning American ' off armed
European belligerents wrote Sen
ator Stone, chairman of the Sen
ate Foreign Relations Committee,
that he could not consent to any
abridgment of the rights of Ame
rican citizens.
The tetter says In part: ." I ap- '
predate your kind and frank let
ter. I feel it calls for an equally
frank reply. You are right in as
suming that I will do everything
in my power to keep the United
States out of war. I think the
country can feel no uneasiness of
my course in that respect. The
course the Central nations havs
announced for the future in re
gard to sea warfare seems, for
the moment, ts threaten insur
mountable obstacles, but so mani
festly unconsistsnt are the differ
ent assurances given I must be
lieve that explanations presently
to ensue will put a different as
pect on it. In any event my duty
is clear.
"No nation or group of nations
has th right, while the war is in
progress, to disregard the princi
ples which all nations.' have agreed
upon in mitigation of the horrors
of war. If the rights of American
citizens are abridged or denied
we should, it seems to me, have in
our honor no choice.
"For my part I cannot consent
to any abridgment in any respect.
The honor and self respect of the
nation is involved. It is import
ant to reflect that if in this in
stance we allowed expediency to
take the place of principle, the
door would inevitably be opined
to still greater concessions."
The letter was in answer to one
written late in the afternoon by
Senator Stone outlining the situa
tion in the capital where, since
yesterday morning persistent de
mands were made for some action
to lessen the possibility of war
between .the United States and
Germany. The President's state
ment will be repeated tomorrow
to Speaker Clark, Representative
Kitchin and Represetnative Flood,
chairman of the House Foreign
Affairs Committee, who alter ask
ed an engagement ' in order to ex
plain the position of the House
and asked the President for a
statement or the administration's
views. . ;
The President wrote the letter,
shutting himself in his study while
leaders vainly attempted to get
him on the telephone. After a tele
phone conference with bis cabinet
and other close advisers, hit de
cision was to end all speculation
on the position of the government
and let Congress and the country
know that the Administration be
lieved that the United States
could do nothing but stand behind
the rights of its citizens and the
rreedom or the seas.
Representative Glass, of Virgi
nia, issued a statement that he
was unable to discover any "re
volt" against the President's poli
cy. "There are a few men, but
precious few, who seem willing to
haul down the American flag and
circumscribe the rights of Ameri
can citizens on the .high seas to
save a ball or two of cotton.
Stone's letter was written at

wanted to know the exact attitude

3000 WILL VOTE
AT THE SPRING
City Clerk Gives Some Fgures
on Last Registration. YVo-:
men Are Expected to Take1
Much Larger Interest I
i
That the registration for the
city election will approximate
three thousand is the opinion of
M. L. Butler, city clerk. That of
ficial expects a material increase
over that of 1914, partly from a
natural increase in the number of
people in the city and also from
the fact that more women are ex
pected to take an active part in
the elections this year. '
The number registred in the
1914 election was 2S47. Of thU
number 757 were women. The
city clerk, who hadled the last
registration, expects this number
to be materially Increased by
May 12. when the registration
books close.
Some of the peculiarities of the
registration were explained by
Butler and will be of an inform
ing nature to the majority or the
people in the city.
In the first place only four days
from March 28. will be available
to register before the primaries.
This applies, however, only to
those who did not register in the
spring of 1914. Those who did
register two years ago, conse
quently, will not have lo register
for the primary, but will have to
register for the city election.
Butlej said. last evening, that
in alf probability theer would be
some provision made tor those to
register on primary dav as it was
a roregone conclusion that many,
who did not register al the last
election, will want to vote and
will be unable to unless thev se
cure a duplicate of their registra
tion for the coming election.
Another light, thrown pn the
matter-.of registration, is the fct
that no declaration or partv will
h required in the city elections.
It was thought that recent legisla
tion, enacted by the stato legisla
ture, would torce those who wish-
