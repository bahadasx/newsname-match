No waste la coming from the Hall

led conveying the ore to mill. It is
most peculiar ore In appearance and
one would hardly believe that It
came from a drpth of nearly 1300 feet
and from a hot, wet winze at that,
for If has every appearance of oxida
tion, being a deep brick-red In color.
In fact, it is partly oxidized.
Nothing is given out by the. com
pany as to the grade of ore, but It
apparently doesn't require sorting
This ore Is taken from an east drift
from a point 100 feet at an angle be
low the 1200 level.
Meanwhile the company is uprais
ing from the 1400 and at the vertical
1300-foot point an Intermediate will
be run. This upraise Is three com
partments and Is being hurried up
