TIGER TRACK MEN GO
TOMEETJHCiAiC,
Schulte Leaves With Eleven
"Strongest Ever" for
Indoor Contest.
Eleven Tiger track men, accom
panied by C. L.. Brewer and H. V.
Schulte, left this afteruon on the 4:20
o'clock Wabash Tor Kansas City, where
they will compete In the K. C. A. C.
meet in Convention Hall tomorrow
night. Simpson, Powell, Rider, (label-
man, Renick, Pittam, Eaton, Niedorp,
Wyatt, Warren and Daggy are the Ti
ger entrants.
This year's meet brings together one
or the brightest arrays or track stars
that has ever competed In the Kansas
City indoor games. J. E. ("Ted")
Meredith of the University of Penn
sylvania, holder ot the world's record
in the half- and quarter-mile, Is the
headline attraction. He will run a
half-mile against Earl Eby of Chicago
and Fred Rodkey of the University of
Kansas.
F. W. Floyd, Tormer Tiger vaulter,
will wear for the first time the cherry
diamond of the M. A. A. of St. Louis,
and is expected to officialize the
world's record he made here last Sat
urday in practice. Captain Powell,
Floyd's team-mate Tor two years, will
again vault with "Prof," but, for the
first time, the points will be chalked
up on different score cards. Simpson
will compete against Joe IomIs,
world's record holder in the 50-yard
low hurdles, in both the hurdle event
and the 50-yard dash. Irvln Mahl, the
much-touted St. Louis sprinter, who
owns a victory over Loomls, will com
pete in the 50-yard dash.
This meet is interesting from a local
standpoint because of the opportunity
afforded to get lines on the Missouri
and Kansas teams, which will get to
gether in the annual indoor dual con
test March 17. Missouri and Kansas
athletes will avoid actual competition
in this meet as much as possible. The
coaches are in a peculiar position;
each wishes to learn as much as pos
sible of the other's team and at the
same time disclose as little informa
tion as possible.
The Missouri quarter-mllers will not
compete except in the relay. They will
confine their energies to this event, in
which they will endeavor to hang up a
new track record over the University
of Oklahoma.
Renick will be in the dash and the
hurdles. Rider the 1,000-yard run and
Gabelman the mile. These three will
appear for the first time In Tiger suits.
Pittam, In the high jump. Is the only
other man who is entering his first
varsity competition for Missouri.
