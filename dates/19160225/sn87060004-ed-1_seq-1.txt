v.:
MARBRAY
FERGUSON
NOHUILTY
Nortonville Man Charged
With Dynamiting Negro
Cabin at That Place
Exonerated
The case of the commonwealth
against Marbray Ferguson, charged
dynamiting a negro cabin near Nor
tonville, Ky. , which resulted in the
death of two negroes, went to the
jury this afternoon and in fifteen
minutes a verdict of not guilty was
returned.
Ferguson immediately left for his
liome in Nortonville, He took the
stand today and denied any knowl
edge whatever of having stated that
some negroes would be "blown-to
hell." He confessed to having been
beastly drunk earlier in the night of
the explosion. His son stated that
iie took his father home from Nor
tonville about 11 o'clock on this
night and that his father was so in
toxicated that he had to be partially
"Carried the entire- distance.
This story was corroborated by
N.J. Wilburn, who assisted the son
in carrvine the father home. Fergu
son's daughter stated she slept in the
same room with her fatl er and was
awake at the time of the explosion
and that her father, sound sleep in
an adjoining bed, was not awakened
by the explosion.
Ferguson while on the stand told
a straightforward story and was not
confused in any of thequestions sub
mitted in the cross examination The
case against N. J. Wilburn, who was
indicted on the same charge but tried
separately was dismissed with leave
to submit to the grand jury at any
time.
Wilburn, under arrest some time
after the dynamiting, was in the cus
tody of a deputy sheriff, struck the
marshal at Nortonville claiming that
the marshall had several times taunt
ed him for this offense. Wilburn
was charged with assault and battery
and was fined $50 in court today. Be
pleaded guilty to the charge.

CALOMEL SALIVATES
AND MAKESJOU SICK
Acts like dynamite on a slug
gish liver and you lose
a day's work
There is no reason why a per
son should take sickening, Bali-'
vating calomel when 50c buys a
largo bottle of Dodson's Liver
Tone a perfect' substitute for
calomel.
It is o pleasant, vegetable liq
uid which will" start your liver
just as surely as cabmel, but it
doesn't make you" 8 ck and can
not salivate.
Children and grown folks can
take Dodsou's Liver Tone, be
cause it is perfectly harmless.
Oalomel is a dangerous drugr
It is mercury and attacks yonr
bones, Take a dose of nasty cal
omel today and you will feel
weak, sick and uaneeated to
morrow. Don't lose a. dav's
woik. Take a spoonful of Dod-
aou 'a Liver Tone instead and yon
will wake np feeling great. No
more biliousnesp, constipation,
sluggishnesp, headache, coated
tongue or sour stomach. Your
drugeist says if you don't find
Dodsou's Liver Tone acts better
than horrible calomel your mon
ey is waiting for you.

A Distinctive Reason
What is the chief reason for the superi
ority of Royal Baking Powder?
There are several good reasons, but there
is one which distinguishes Royal from other
baking powders.
This reason, which every woman should
knoJgjjs that Royal Baking Powder is made
frorrircream of tartar, which comes from
grapes. This means a healthful fruit origin.
It means natural food as distinguished from
mineral substitutes used in other baking
powders.
