tntion in ronirress for action warning
Americans off armed merchantmen. ' "ess a'"'"4 my course in that respect,
wrote a letter tonight to Senator Stone, : Through my anxious mouths I have
chairman of the senate foreign rela- , striven for that object, amidst diffieul
tions committee, statine that he could ties more manifold than can have been
not consent to the abridgement of the '
rights of American citizens in any re
spect. "The honor and self-respect of the
nation is involved," he said. "We covet
jieace, and shall preserve it at any cost
but the loss of honor."
The president expressed hope that
explanations of the declared intentions
of the central powers of Europe to
Kink all armed merchant ships without
warning would put a different aspect
on a situation wh:ch now seemed to
present insuperable obstacles.
"We have had no reason to question
I heir good faith or their fidelity to
their promises in the past," he added,
"and I for one feel confident that we
Bball have none in the future."
The letter was in answer to one writ
ten late this aftertfoon by Senator
Stone outlining the situation existing
at the capitol, where since yesterday
morning persistent demands had been
made for some action which might les
sen the possibility of war between the
United States and Germany.
The president's statement will be re
peated tomorrow morning to Speaker
'lark. Representative Kitchin, Major-
lty Leader, and Representative ;
Flood, chairman of the house foreign j
affairs committee, who late today
asked for an engagement in order to
explain the position in which the house
found itself and ask the president for
a statement of the administration's
views.
i ne presioent wrote nis letter during
the afternoon, shutting himself up in
his study while congressional leaders
vainly attempted to get him on the tel
ephone to tell him of developments at
the capitol and to arrange for the calm
of the house leaders.
He began to write after telephone
conversations with cabinet men and
other close advisers. His decision was
to end all speculation over the position
of the government, and to let congress
and the country know that the admirr
istration believed the United States
could do nothing but stand behind the
right of its citizens to the freedom of
the seas.
At the state department today it was
said that in its international aspects
the situation had not changed in the
slightest degree for three or four days.
Officials raid nothing has been heard
from Germany in response to the re
quest of the United States for assur
ances that previous pledges given in
the Lusitania and Arabic negotiations
would not be nullified by the new cam
paign against armed ships. Count von
Bernstorff, the German ambassador,
through whom the request was made,
also was said to be without informa
tion as to when a response would be
forthcoming.
Confidential advices from Berlin,
however, have indicated that Germany
would reply that all assurances previ
ously given would be observed, but
that they applied only to unarmed ves
sels, and would propose discussion of
what defensive armament properly

SEATTLE, Feb. 24. When the Brit
ish freighter Talthybius of the Blue
Funnel line docked here tonight, every
Approach was closely guarded as the
result of an anonymous threat that
the liner's $8,300,000 cargo had been
marked for destruction by alleged
German spies.
The Talthybius brought 5.000 tons
of rubber, worth $3,000,000; silk worth
J 1,000.000, and other oriental products
valued at $2,500,000. The rubber was
shipped from Singapore and will be
rushed by rail to the east for use in
American automobile and tire fac
tories. Owners of water-front property, al
though skeptical of the authenticity
of the warning which was sent to Firo
Marshal Harry1 Bringhurst, placed
guards about their warehouses as a
j recautionary measure.1

ance of a bribe is charged against
Roger Woodbury, former constable, in
a warrant issued against him late to

main in a downtown hotel upon agree
ment to pay him $20 a day.
Woodbury was removed from office
last week by Sheriff John C. Cline.

Investigation during the dav dis
closed that no damage had beer done

that a large firecracker was placed

a storeroom and thrown with an ac
cumulation of trash in the furnace
room, and was in turn thrown into the
furnace by the night janitor, causing
an explosion.

Republican A. P. Leased Wire
Inspired by the presence of their
emperor and led by Crown Prince Fred
erick William, the German troops are
engaged in one of the greatest battles
of the war on the western front, cen
tering around the fortress of Verdun.
Attack has followed attack against the
French line after bombardments, in
cessant and terrific, continuing for
several days.
While the Germans have not been
able, despite the rain of shells and fu
rious onslaughts by the infantry, to
break the French line, nevertheless the
French on their right and left wings
have been competed to withdraw their
lines, respectively to the south of Ornes
and behind the town of Samogneux,
six miles north of the fortress.
Only between Malancourt and the
artillery fire. With ltrabant. Haumont '
and Samogneux, and the wooded see-
tions north and northeast of Beaumont i

In Cnami,ane at several points and j
in the Argonne forest, German works

raine the French repulsed a German
reconnoitering party that attempted to
capture a French post north of St.
Martin.
On their end of the line, near Hul
luch, the British exploded a mine and
occupied the crater, and also bombard
ed German trenches near Frelinghein
and Boesingbe. '
On the Russian front from the Riga
region to east Galicia there have been
engagements at various points but no
great results have been attained by
either side. In' the Caucasus, Petro
grad reports that the Russians contin
ue successfully to press back the
Turks. The usual activities by the
Austrians and Italians on the Austro
Italian front continue.
A French air suadron has dropped
a large number of bombs on the out
skirts of Metz, a big fire being ob
served after the attack.
Official announcement has been
made in the Japanese diet by the min
ister of foreign affairs that Japan does
ot intend to send troops to aid the
Russians.
The Earl of Derby' has accepted the
chairmanship of the joint army and
navy board which will control the
British air service.
The Spring Offensive
LONDON, Feb. 24. The great Ver
dun battle which is being watched in
England with keen interest, but thus
far without anxiety, is regarded here
as the long expected big German spring
offensive. It is pointed out that the
French, profiting by their earlier ex
periences in t lie war, now rarely hold
their advanced trenches strongly and
that, therefore, their withdrawal at
some points to the second line is no
sign of weakness.
On the other hand, it is believed that
the French generals are pursuing the
tactics of allowing the enemy to as
sault in masses which involves enor
mous sacrifices to the Germa.it. The
military critics point out thai after
three days of desperate assault the
French second line defenses are still
instact eveyrwhere.
It is assumed here that the Germans
began preparations for this attack at
about the time of the Turkish defeat
in Armenia, which sealed the fate of
Erzerum.
The Times says it has information
that the French are more than usually
confident and serene and are inclined
to contemplate the German onslaught
with considerable satisfaction. The
Times corespondent at Paris hints that
drastic reasons led the Germans to at
tack Verdun. He expresses the opin
ion that General von Bothmer has been
brought from the eastern front to con
duct the operations and admits that
the crown prince's army has been
heavily reinforced from Metz.
"Fortunately, however," says the
correspondent, "the element of sur
prise was totally missing from the

leged defalcations of more than $JO0,

say, recently brought the vessel here

In spite of the high waters of re
cent weeks, the roads for there are
two of them were found to be in
splendid shape. Therefore, it was a
perfectly Jolly and carefree party that
gathered in the dining room of the
Magma hotel at noon. No blow-outs,
no engine trouble, no "getting stuck"
marred the happiness. Bj the time
the clans had accumulated in the cafe
of the "chalet," part of the works
had been seen. The appetites, ren
dered keen by the drive in the cool

sharpness by a climb up some of Su

Goldberg indulged, and he is just out

H. W. Asbury. vice-president of the
chamber of commerce, and a scrt of
chief -de-expedition, arose along with
a cloud of cigar smoke and explained
to the Superior hosts that Phoenix
had got ready to come out of its shell

did he extend any cordial invitations
to others to take up a great deal of

No one apologized for the presence
of a tax-commissioner in the party.
Neither did Tom Campbell, who was

the ball rolling.
Then followed E. F. Kellner, man

tne cause, said:
1 "The very men who voted in Wash-
ington against suffrage because of the
1
"fear of sacrificing the home,' found
it expedient to vote negatively on tha
cnild labo-- proposition. These men
declined to appropriate $29000 for a
child labor inquiry, but they voted
f600,000 for the preservation of fish
and game.-'
