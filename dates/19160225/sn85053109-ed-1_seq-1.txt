Head-On Collision
Ties Up Traffic
Impact So Great Engines
Gould Not be Pried
Apart
A bad head-on collision on
the Great Northern at Egan,
Wednesday morning at 5 A. M.,
tied up traffic for more than
twenty-four hours. Two heavy
freight trains collided at that
point with terrific impact, caus
ing the derailment of eight cars
and the ripping ot the tracks.
The big engines were locked
together so tightly that the
wrecking crews found it im
possible to pull them apart, so
they were sidetracked at Bel
ton.
One engineer was slightly in
jured and a brakeman sustained
an injured ankle. We under
stand that the members of both
train crews jumped from the
trains before the collision oc
curred. Overlooking of orders
by one of the engineers is given
as the cause of the wreck.

Soaring Paper Prices
The uncertainty of conditions
in the paper market, the irreg
ularity and extreme advances
in price's and the difficulties
that attend either the purchase
or sale of paper under existing
war-ruled markets are well set
forth in the following interview
given the Great Falls Tribune
by J. J. Flaherty, vice president
of the Great Falls Paper com
pany:
'There seems to be no limit
to the sharp advances in all
grades of papers, roofing mater
ial, etc. Daily this office re
ceives withdrawals of prices or
telegrams quoting new or high
er advances. These advances
come from every class of paper
manufacture. Some of the
most powerful and strongest
mills have withdrawn their
prices entirely.
"The manufacturers lay the
cause of the rising paper prices
to the shortage of chemicals»
clorine gas, sulphite bleach,
soda ash, rags, clay, aniline
dyes. etc. In some cases these
materials have advanced in
price as much as 1,000 per cent,
and any single item over 20
per cent.
"Fine printers' bonds and flat
writing papers, as school papers,
have advanced several cents per
pound.
"Roofing papers and prepared
roofing have advanced approxi
mately 15 percent, due to short
age of rags, rosin, chemical oils,
etc.
"Paper bags, especially genu
ine kraft bags, have advanced
as high as 40 per cent in two
months. Wrapping papers show
an advance of approximately 75
cents per hundred pounds.
"The paper market is in a
chaotic condition, and it will
continue in this unhealthy con
dition until our chemists can
produce these chemicals at a
low price in large commercial
quantities. There is no let-up
to the present high prices that
all well informed paper experts
write this office. This condition
the paper line is another
direct result of the European
war. Prices will without a
doubt be much higher before
the summer months.

Railway Roundhouse
to Be Enlarged Soon
Ten i6o-Foot Stalls to be sidded
—One of Biggest on Main Line
The Great Northern railway roundhouse will be
enlarged to more than once again its present size the
coming spring. 1600 feet of space will be added—10
new stalls 160 feet long, twice the length of the stalls
in the old structure, capable of housing two large en
gines tandem. The present housing space is 1200 feet.
When completed this will give the local terminal one
of the largest roundhouses on the main line of the road.
"1 he report of the contemplated improvement was
confirmed by Gen. Manager J. M. Gruber while here
last iveek. Mr. Hoagland, one of the head engineers
of the system, was here this week ard did the survey
ing for the extension, on the south side of the present
structure. This information was given the Pioneer
Press yesterday by Foreman Gus Anderson.
Another cinder pit, twice as long as the present one,
the raising and remodeling of the Dormitory and Ho
tel and a number of minor improvements are mapped
out in connection with the'enlargement of the round
house. It is evident that the Company has decided
to make the Cut Bank terminal one of the most im
portant on the main line, as other very important im
provements are being considered, we understand.
This is very good news to Cut Bank indeed. It
means the expenditure of a lot of railway money here,
this year, it means permanency for this terminal be
yond question and it should mean city building in keep
ing with the railway improvement and fine farming
prospects. The present will be the greatest year
our history.

Series of Receptions
Mrs. R. L. Taft was hostess at
series of three parties; on
Thursday and Saturday after
noons of last week and on Tues
day of this week. Cards and
contests were the principal di
versions at these parties. Tues
day afternoon the spirit of
Washington's birthday was
made manifest in the decora
tions of the home—tiny hatch
ets, flags and other patriotic
evidences. The concluding
number on the program of each
reception was a delicious lunch -
eon.
Interest In Contest
The Teton County S. S. con
test was inaugurated Sunday
at Cut Bank with enthusiasm
and a big attendance. The mag
nificent total of a hundred ten
was recorded by the secretary,
or about a hundred per cent
above the average of the last
three months, which is to be
the basis of competition. Next
Sunday, it is to be hoped, new
classes will be formed, with a
still bigger enrollment.
We want every lady in Cut
Bank to be a determining fac
tor in helping us decide the line
of corsets we shall handle. For
several days you will find on
display for your approval thir
ty-one different styles of corsets
of a very popular and widely
advertised line. — Cut Bank

2,500 acres of land will be

Announcement
For the past three years the
Pioneer Press has maintained
the lowest subscription rate of
any eight-page paper in this
county. We made it a policy
to allow persons who paid their
subscriptions at any time with
in a year from the date on
which payment was due this
reduction. We were glad to be
able to grant our subscribers
this privilege at a time when
pijint paper was much lower
than at present.
Since the beginning of the
new year print paper has near
ly doubled in price. The only
way to meet this condition
without positive loss is to re
store the old price, $2.00 per
year—and even with this ad
vance the margin of profit in
the subscription end will be
wiped out if prices continue to
advance—and reports from the
paper houses are not at all as
suring.
In order to give our subscrib
ers an opportunity to take ad
vantage of the present rate, we
have set March 10, Friday, as
the final date for paying sub
scriptions under the present
rate. Those who desire to do
so may pay under this rate for
as many years as they desire
We have taken this step re
luctantly, but circumstances
have made it imperative if loss
in this end of our business is to
be averted.
The Lady Maccabees will
give a dance at Brown's hall on
Feb'v 29th, and invite all who
enjoy dancing to be their guests
on that evening.
Roast Pig on Bill
Last evening was another en
joyable one in Odd Fellow an
nals. Sixteen candidates for
the third degree were put
through the ceremonials of the
order. Following the ceremon
ies there was a mirthful social
session and supper, served by
thirteen ladies of the Rebekah
lodge. The headliner on the
menu was young roast pig, pre
pared with such delicacy and
served with such deftness as to
elicit many flowery compli
ments for the ladies. Fifty-one
persons partook of the fine re
past.
Both Bridges Out
Both the wagon and railway
bridges over the Marias river
below Shelby went out last
week. Trains on the Great
Northern were detoured via
Havre for several days, but
traffic was resumed over the
direct route this week. The
commissioners of Toole county
had just finished paying for the
wagon bridge when the ice
going down river swept it off
its moorings, so the county will
have to assume another burden
in replacing it.
W. T. Elmer stopped here a
short time Monday, on his way
to Spokane, from Winside, Can
ada. Mr. Elmer is going to the
Inland country for the purpose
of purchasing horses for his
ranch in Canada. Elmer likes
Canada pretty well, but prefers
being called a citizen of the
United States and hinted that
he would return to his ranch
here before many years.
Sutherlin Disgusted
Editor R. N. Sutherlin of the
Rocky Mountain Husbandman,
Register of the Great Falls land
office and one of the leading
democrats of Montana, is very
much disgusted over the Inter
ior Department's very miserly
attitude toward the appropriat
ing of funds for the completion
of the Sun River project and the
withdrawing of much irrigable
land from under the project.
The Pioneer Press does not con
cur in the views of Mr. Suther
lin with respect to irrigation in
general. But as a pioneer west
ern man who has seen Montana
in all varying weather moods,
and as a man of the finest con
scientious scruples, we have al
ways respected his opinions.
We have always believed, too,
'tftat if .portion nf northern
Montana is actually in need of
irrigation it is that same Sun
River section. And in sweep
ing aside policy and politics to
frankly express a sincere con
viction, the venerable editor of
the Husbandman has apprecia
bly gone up in our esteem.
FARM LOANS
We have plenty of money to loan on farm loan
security, and are making a specialty of farm loans.
We can close loans quickly, and advance a part
of the money as soon as papers are signed. The bal
ance of the money handed over as soon as the ab
stract, showing good title, and other papers are rec
orded.
In case you have need of a loan of this kind, be
sure and ask for our terms.
