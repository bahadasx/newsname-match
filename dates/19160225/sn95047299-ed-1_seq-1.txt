The People Who Will Get Curious
Some Day and Open this Stone
to Read of the People
Who Laid It.
A copy of this issue of The Pa
latka News is to be among the pa
pers to be preserved to posterity in
the corner stone of the new govern
ment building, the same to be laid
and sealed with imposing Masonic
ceremonies tomorrow.
it is appropriate, therefore, that
posterity should, through this jour
nal, be able to learn something of
the city and the people and the mo
tives that move them at this time.
The time: February 26th, A. D.
1916.
Palatka is a pretty city of 5,000 in
habitants. We speak guardedly as
to this number, because our census
enumerator is a man. of moods, capa
ble of both expansion and tontrac
tiom The 5,000 were named as his
liumber when he took the State's
census in the summer of 1915. In
the Sweet spiing time of the same
year, when he took the census for
purely home consumption, he stated
that "Palaitka's population is 7,358,
of which 3,585 are colored," mean
ing Negroes.
So, dear posterity, we are keeping
on the safe side and giving you the
lowest figure.
It will not be your good fortune to
know this enumerator. His name
was Julian d'Nazarie; it may be Hud,
for all we know now; he is gone and
we can't predict the manner of his
goin, nor point you to his grave.
However, you probably have exam
ples of his robust type among your
selves; you may be familiar with the
species. .
Palatka had seven miles of brick
paved streets in 1916, and all the
cwt9 Vind fine concrete sidewalks.
The latter are gradually coming in
to disuse, as our people have gener

The city has plenty of water which
comes from the springs in the hills
to the west of us. Two water com
panies furnish our supply, for we are
irreat water drinkers. One of the
companies is a Boston concern, while
the other is a municipally owned
plant. They are somewhat antago

To most of us it is merely wet, but
connoisseurs differ. They are privi
leged, however, to pay their money
and take their choice. The city is,
at this writing, on the Danks oi m

composed of water. It is a majestic

FARM EXPERT HERE
L. L. Cantrell has wide) Ex
perience and is Highly
Recommended.
L. L. Cantrell. Putnam fh inn tv 'c
Agricultural expert has assumed his
duties and though in the county now
only a few days has already made a
most favorable impression on all
whom he has met.
Mr. Cantrell comes to Florida
from Covington County, Ala., where
he has been employed as farm dem
onstrator for the last year. Prof-
iessor n. a. rettus, principal of thf
County High School, in a lrtf.ter tn t.ho
editor of the Andalusia Star says:
i nave just, reaa your article in
the last issue of The Star, stating
that L. L. Cantrell. OUr COllTUt.V flpm.
onsitration agent, is soon to leave for
rioriaa. we regret very much that
he must go. In the first place, be
cause his services have been of un
told benefit to the county, and be
cause ovingxon county can ill af
ford to be without someone to fill his
posdtinv just at this time.
Mr. Cantrell has had five years ex
perience in government soil survey
work in Central states which makes
him a particularly valuable man for
Putnam county, more particularly for
the new comers who are so rapidly
taking up the lands of the county.
He is a graduate of the Polytechnic
Institute at Auburn, Ala,, and before
that was graduated from the Smith
District Agricultural College at Ham
ilton, Ala. He was also a first grade
teacher in Alabama and had four
vers experience in rural schools.
Mr. Cantrell who is accompanied
by his wife will make his home in
Palatka and they are warmly wel
comed in Palatka's intellectual and
social circles.

but who do some voting when the
time comes to vote, tremble for the
fate of this charter. As we stated
before it is to be voted on next Tues
day, the 29th inst.
There is much more that could be
said concerning Palatka, but as you
have probably noticed that our space
is valuable, we must cut this short.
Palatka has a sewer system and
three banks. It has two grave
yards and only seven doctors. There

The war in Europe which has been
raging for some two years has hurt
us m a business way at least it 13
the reason most generally given for
thi present dullness of trade. We
have a good many farmers who are
making money raising potatoes on
the east side of the river. They
spend their days in their potato or
chards and their evenings at the Elks
club, many of them. Several of them
are counting on getting rich enough
on the coming crop to buy a new au
tomobile of the 1917 pattern.
We cannot close without remarking
that the oration over the laying of
this cornerstone, will be made by
Col. S. J. Hilbum, who is without
loubt our most eloquent orator. He
is frequently called on to do work
of this kind; only last week having
introduced William Jennings Bryan
to an audience in one of our local
theaters. You may not know much
about this William Jennings Bryan,
but suffice it to say that he got his
political start twenty years ago by
proclaiming the "heaven-born" ratio
of 'steen to one. as between silver
and gold, and that for all the years
followine. up to now he has been in
the limelight as our most frequent
candidate for the presidency and most
conspicuous democrat. Just now he
is for peace as against war. though
strange as it may seem, most of our
people prefer war.
But we were talking abuot Sam
Hilburn; wish you all might know
him. While he lived he worked hard
practicing law and politics and am
assed a fortune; later he had leisure to
cultivate his ease, and so he was
called upon freouently for orations.
He of course will have been a long
time dead when this box is made to
sive up its contents, but you who
rend thia can sramble on his being
a tenant of one of the most conspic
uous stars in the firmament. None

Hilburn.
Putnam Man Wins Prizes.
As usual Charles Francis of Inter
lacheu has been pulling down the
large majority of the first prizes for
poultry exhibits at the various fairs
held in Florida during the winter.
Again at Orlando last week the
list of prizes has the name of Chas.
Francis more times than all other ex
hibitors combined. The list was pub
lished in the Times-Union of the 18th
instant.
As a breeder of fancy poultry Mr.
Francis probably has the largest va
riety of blooded cockerels and hens of
any one in the ttate, and his exhibit.
are doing much in stimulating' a love
for poultry raising in Honda.
Pete Hagan Disabled.
P. M. Hagan, deputy internal rev
enue collector, met with a painful
though not serious accident one day
last week near Jacksonville. Mr.
Hatran had been called on special du
ty at an early hour in the morning,
before sun up, and when about six
miles from Jacksonville stepped sud
denly into a hole some four feet
deep, from which he suffered a most
painful injury. Since the accident
Mr. Haean has been confined to his
bed in Jacksonville, where he is at
tended bv his wife and daughter. At
first Dr. Morris, who is treating him,
thought an operation would be neces
sary, but fortunately this was avoid
ed. Mr. Hagan is getting better
and hopes to be home in. a day or
two, readv to resume his campaign
for Sheriff.
Under Supervision of Dr. J.
Y. Porter, State Health
Officer.
The health exhibit which the State
Board of Health is exhibiting in all
parts of Florida this winter and
which is being carried from place to
place on a special train fitted out
for the purpose under direction of
Dr. Joseph Y. Porter, one of the
most commanding figures in the
world in his relations to the promo
tion of public health, will arrive in
.Palatka this evening over the Florida
East Coast Railway from the south.
President Fearnside of the State
Board of Health, who has arranged
for the exhibit being shown in Pa
latka, has arranged for the train be
ing placed on a side-track within ea
sy access of the people, who are in
vited to call and inspect.
the exhibit is one of the most
marvelous collections in the country.
and everything connected with it has
been placed with the view of educat
ing the people by object lesson to
sanitary and right living.
Dr. Porter, who is considered an
authority on matters of public health
in all parts of the country, is in
personal charge. It was Dr. Por
ter who stood guard in Jacksonville
during the yellow lever scourge
more than a decade ago. It was
this same Dr. J. Y. Porter who has
made the recurrence of such an epi
demic in Florida practically impos
sible. Florida owes to this remark
able man more than it can every re
pay. He points the way to State
Health and his directions are all so
sensible and so easily followed that
Floridians have generally adopted
them and as a result this once fever
stricken and malarious Stare is now
regarded as one of the great health
centers of the world.
The exhibit tomorrow is of course
free; it is your exhibit; a schn-.l of
health. Be sure to see it.
Dr. Porter writes that his trip
down the east coast ha1- ' een a great
success; thousands h"ve availed
tVuvmsplves c.I" i':s opportunity to
visit this wcnde-ful school of haalth.
Voters in Charter Election.
The ctuestion as to who is eligible
to vntA in the charter election next
Tuesday is frequently being asked.
The News interviewed Henis Pe
termann, city registration officer on
this point and Mr. Petermann said:
"Only those are eligible to vote m
the city charter election who were
qualified voters of the city at the
oloction of Anril. 1915. The
books have not been opened for oth-
rs o qualify."
