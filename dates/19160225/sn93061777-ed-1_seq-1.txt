Residence Burns
About 10 A. M. Wednesday
night a thrw room hous on the
corner of Vigil and Thornton
streets, in some unknown way,
caught fire and was soon in ash
es. There was no one living in
the house and thp fire had been
burning some time before it was
discovered and the alarm was
turned in. However had the
alarm been promptlr given it
would have been of no avail, for
the building was too far from anv
water plug to be reached by the
present amount of fire hose.
Better fire protection for Clovis
is a vital need.
Barn Burns.
Thursday morning about 11
o'clock a small barn belonging
to Tom Davenport caught fire
and soon burned to ihe ground.
The barn is supposed to have
caught fire from soma toy caps
being fired in a toy pistol by
some small boys The building
was used by J. B. Lindley as a
garage.
Small Pox
Several cases of small pox, in
a mild form, have broken out in
Clovis this week. With the
proper precaution being taken
by our health authorities and all
others, we do not anticipate that
the disease will spread.
Every precaution should be
taken, and doubtless will be to
prevent the disease from spread
ing. This will probably man
the quarantining of some, and
thereby, the curtailisg of their
"personal liberties," but it is
necessary that a few suffer for
the benefit of the whole, and
who will say it isn't fair?
Mission Garage Sold.
The Western Tire and Garage
Company have bought the Mis
sion Garage. One of the men con
nected in an official way, with
this company said to a News re
porter: "It is the intention of our
company to build nineteen gar
ages in New Mexico, at an aver
8ge cost of $10,000 each. Our pre
sent building- in Clovis is only
temporary. We expect to erect
an up to-date garage building
here. We are incorporated to do
business in New Mexico with a
capital stock of $1,000,000. Our
chain of garages will be extend
ed over this state, Texas, Col
orado, Arizona, and all the west
ern Btates. We are building a
plant between the railroad tracks
in Farwell Texas, with offices in
Texico."
Enlarges Grocery Business
We were in error last week
when we stated that J. A, Me
farlin had bought the Busby
stock of groceries. A. B, Austin
proprietor of the Model Grocery
is the man who purchased this
stock.
Mr. Austin has enlarged, and
otherwise changed this stock of
groceries until this is now one of
the neatest and most thoroughly
up to-date and down to the-min-ute
grocery stores in the city.
R. H. Mann, an experienced
groceryman fromQuanah, Texas
is in active charge.
Mr. Austin said to the News
man: "The people in that part
of town need and deserve a first
c'..js g-acery "tore, and it is m
intention to keep this store in
operation at the same old stand,
and make it one of the very best
in town. I will keep in stock
there a clean, fresh stock of
groceries always and sell at
right prices."
Stockman's Convention
We acknowledge, with pleas
ure, an invitation to attend the
Sixteenth Annual Panhandle and
Southwestern Stockman's Con
vention, which convenes in At
buquerque, March 7, 8 and 9.
The biggest hearted bunch of
red blood Americans that ever
assembled is these cattle men.
We would "shore" line to go.
and if our bank account hasn't
dwindled to the vanishing
"pint." we think we will go and
rub up against that bunch of
big hearted, big brained gentlemen.
Dry Goods Gompany
Some Corn
The News man hopped into
his buzz wagon and buzzed out
to J. N. Parrotts Monday after
noon. As usual that gentleman
farmer was busy. He had a pair
of superfine horseB hitched to an
extra large wagon, while he,
with an extra large scoop shovel
was scooping extra large ears of
corn into the afore-mentioned
wagon.
"This load will round out
1000 bushels of corn I have sold
this year," said Mr. Parrot. "I
have that pile you see there left '
There was between 200 and 800
bushels of corn in "that pile. "
This corn was grown on .10 acres
of land. "I have been here since
1906 and I have raised corn every
year. I have had corn to sell
every year save two" said Mr.
Parrott.
Thi3 farmer-stockman has
thrashed 1835 bushels of grain

corn, ami the produce from .'i0
acres he did not thrash.

Deming Sheriff Shot
The killing of Sheriff. D. B.
Stephens, of Luna eounty, comes
hs a distinct shock to thousands
of people in this state. Mr.
Stephens was fearless and
courageous in the discharge of
his duty. He was a terror to
the "bad" men of the country,
and his death is mourned by
hosts of Saw abiding citizens
over the entire state.
The jailor. J. C. Tabor, was
overpowered, his gun and a
small sum ef money taken from
him. He was then locked in a
cell and five prisoners made their
escape. One of the prisoners
telephoned a local garage, say
ing he was the Sheriff, and ask
ing that a car be sent immediate
ly, as he wanted to take a sick
man to a health resort some dis
tance away. The car was
brought and the driver thrown
in a cell, and the five outlaws
took the car and headed for the
mountains near Rincon. An
hour later the jail delivery was
discovered and Sheriff Stephens
with a posse of deputies set out
in hot pursuit. The bandits be
ing over taken a fight ensued in
which the Sheriff met death, al
so one of the bandits. Another
outlaw was wounded, also one
of the Sheriff's posse. Another
one of the desperadoes was cap
tured the following day. The
other two are still at large.

talist and bloated bond holder,
of Farwell. Texas, was looking
