Men and Women Buy Liquor Freely; Policemen, She Says,

ONI: little woman, prompted by mother-love and an exceptional sense of
civic responsibility, has thrown herself Into the whirl of Seattle's po
litical fight.

—and not simply for one man.
"I put on my coat and hat and started out. Years of experience as a
newspaper writer gave me confidence.
"1 went up dim stairways.
"I knocked at doors that were opened slightly, while tired-looking wom

"I FOUND THAT THE WOMEN IN THE HOUSES OF SHAME
AND THE SLUGGISH MEN ASSOCIATED WITH THEM, HAD BEEN
WARNED THAT IF GRIFFITHS WAS ELECTED HE WOULD CI AMP
THE LID DOWN ON THE WHOLE DISTRICT.
'"TIGHTER THAN HELL,' WAS THE WAY THOSE WOMEN EX
PRESSED IT."
Mrs. Charter leaned forward.
"It In silly for any one to nav that vie# In not a disease In Seattle today. There are dozens of
houses flileil with girls and women. There Is suffering and disease as ft re"ult of It. And there In

"AFTER I MAI) GATHERED PAOE AFTER PAOE OK NOTES. I WENT TO TWO POUCE
OFFICERS AND TALKED TDK SITI'ATION OVER WITH THEM MOTII OFFICERS WERE
SYMPATHETIC WITH MR. ORIFFITHB' IDEAS. IIOTII OF THEM OPENLY ADMITTED THE
SITUATION IS ROTTEN.
"I had found out, and these officer* admitted It, that the 'district' la widely distributed. I found
out that both women and men can get liquor almost anywhere.

"That mnn wan perfectly sincere nud clean. Ho didn't know then that I wan Interacted In the
Griffiths Ideas."
Mrs. Charier han a keen, broad viewpoint toward the pending struggle between Griffiths and

"This fight, to me," she says, "Is more than a conflict between two men. It Is the struggle be

"I don't believe that HI Gill and Austin E. Griffiths could ever look at the same problem In the

to heip elect Austin E. Griffiths as
mayor.
Mrs. Remington Charter, maga
zine writer, traveler, lecturer, was
not content to sit smugly back and
believe what the women in her
neighborhood thought about politics.
She had come to Seattle from
New York a year ago, with her two
daughters, in search of health and
happiness.
She had heard much of Hi Gill.
She had heard of Austin E. Grif
fiths.
She believed a mother was partly
responsible for any existing syitem
as long as she failed to inform her
self and failed to vote accordingly.
She believed that she owed it to
her two daughters, in Broadway high
school, to take part in the fight.
"I have been convinced all my
life that the welfare of women is
only safe in a clean city," she said.

The upshot of the session, however, was no action to be
taken by congress today, at least.
President Wilson emphatically told the conferees that
he would not budge from his plan of insisting that Germany
recognize every American right.

is overwhelmingly in favor of issuing a warning to Ameri- j
