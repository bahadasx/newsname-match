CHINESE ARE
DEFEATED BY
REBEL BANDS
Official Admission of Loss by
Government Troops Is
Made by China.
NO ASSISTANCE ASKED
Governor of Yun-Nan Re
quests U. S. and Other
Countries' Neutrality.
Peking, Jan. 26. (Correspondence
of The Associated Press.) Official
acknowledgment of the defeat of gov
ernment troops by the Yun-Nan rebels
on the Sze-t'huen border was with
held until today when the state de
partment issued a mandate denounc
ing Tsai Ao, in which admission is
made that the revolutionists sur
prised the regular army and defeated
a small garrison.
Information .received in Feking
from non-Chinese sources shows that
the Yun Nanese who descended on the
city of Suifu and captured it num
bered about 10.000. The garrison of
Chinese at Suifu numbered about 4,000,
but these troops left for the north
several days before the arrival of the
Yun Nanese and consequently there
was no resistance to the entrance of
the latter. The fleeing government
forces are renorted to have started
north for Tze-Chow.
R?hel Forces Strong.
Estimates as to the total strength of
the revolutionary army vary from 20,
000 to 10,000 but neutral military ex
perts who have a knowledge of the
supplies the Yun Nan forces had be
fore the trouble, are of the opinion
that the revolutionists can probably
put about 40,000 men into the field
with fair infantry equipment. The
government has about three times this
many troops either in Hankow or on
their way to Yang-Tse ports. Trans
portation on the river is difficult and
probably not more than 10,000 have
reached Chung-King, which is about
100 miles west of Suifu which now Is
in the hands of the revolutionists.
Asks Strict Neutrality.
Dr. Paul S. Reinsch, American min
ister to China, and the heads of other
legations in Peking received a formal
circular dispatch today from Tang-Chi-Yao,
the military governor of
Yun Nan, and Jen Kao-Tseng, civil
governor of the same province, urging
foreign powers to remain neutral in
the present Chinese revolution. .

Lisbon, (via Paris, Feb. 25.) The
Official Gazette publishes two decrees
regarding the 36 German and Austrian
merchant vessels seized yesterday in
the Tagus river and placed under the
Portuguese flag. The first indicates
the work of refitting to be performed
In order to adapt these vessels for the
transport and other purposes for
nich they have been requisitioned as
it is distinctly given to be given to be
understood that they have not been
confiscated. The second decree ap
points a committee to supervise the
execution of the work indicated.

THE WAR
TODAY
The (rreat battle around Uie fort
ress of Verdun, which has been in
progress for nearly a week be
tween the Germans and French
continues with increasing Tiolence.
Kmperor William himself, not far
behind the battle line, is directing
the movements of his forces. En
gaeements on all other fronts are
dwarfed in comparison with the
battle of Verdun, and the outcome
of the struggle is watched w ith the
keenest interest every where. The
Germans appear to be forcing the
fighting, regardless of the cost of
life. One French official report
describes the battlefield between
the Meuse and Ornes as piled with
(erman dead. With their on
slaught of artillery and infantry,
the Germans have not been able
to break the French line, but the
French on their right and left
wings have been compelled to
withdraw their lines, respectively
to the sonth of Ornes and behind
the town of Samngneux, six miles
north of Verdun. The correspond
ent of the London Times says the
artillery fire has become so ter
rific that the trench, at moments,
becomes of no Taliie as a defense,
and consequently there has been a
necessary partial return to a war
of movement. He fnrther savs that
should the unexpected happen and
the entire first line fall into the
hands of the Germans, they still
would be confronted by five other
lilies, increasing in strength as
they approach the fortress.
ChampaneuTille is still within
the French lines, the official state
ment indicates, the new front be
ing somewhat to the east. This Til
lage, which may be the next point
of German attack, is something
more than a mile southwest of
Samogneaux. on the east bank of
the Passerelle canal, which leads
to Verdun. Beaumont, behind
which the F'rench front now ex
tends, is almost due north of Ver
dun and about seven miles distant.
According to Paris the Germans
have halted in their offensive for
the moment at least.
The Turkish official statement
tells of another attempt by the
British to advance below Kut-K.l-Amara
on the Tigris. The attack
ers were repulsed with heavy
losses.
President Wilson, in a letter
last night to Senator Stone, chair
man of the senate foreign rela
tions committee, announces in re
gard to movement on congress in
favor of warning Americans not to
take passage on armed belligerent
merchantmen, that he will not con
sent to any abridgement of the
rights of American citizens in any
respect. The president expresses
confidence that the explanation
from the central powers of the
situation that has arisen over their
armed merchantmen memoranda
will pnt a different aspect on mat
ters. In announcing his stand the
president says: "The honor and
self respect of the nation Is in
volved. We covet peace and shall
preserve it at any cost, but the loss
of honor."

Threatening Performance of
Germany to Be Post
poned, Is Claim.
GREAT HELP TO WILSON
By Giving Additional Time
President May Be Able
to Clear Issue.
Washington, Feb. 25. "I think the
chances are Germany will postpone
this threatening performance until
April 1, or at least until the middle of
March," said Speaker Clark today, af
ter a conference with President Wil
son. "There is a rumor to that effect
and a postponement would give us
more time."
Speaker Clark told the president
that if a resolution of warning, such
as the president opposes, were forced
to a vote in the house now it would
pass by a majority of two to one.
Congress met today with President
Wilson's position on the question of
armed merchantmen clearly defined.
Members of congress had read the
president's letter to Senator Stone, in
which he declared unequivocally that
he would not consent to an abridge
ment of the rights of American citi
zens in any respect
The president's communication was
in response to a letter from the Mis
souri senator, outlining the situation
at the capitol, where for two days
there had been a persistent demand
for action by congress warning Amer
fcairs" ro keep off armW merchant1
men.
The president said that he had striv
en for peace and had succeeded and
that he had no doubt that he would
continue to succeed. He expressed
confidence that the explanations by
the central powers of the situation
which has arisen over their armed
merchantmen memoranda would soon
be received and that the explanations
would put a different aspect on mat
ters. The fight in congress over warning
Americans off armed ships marked
time today, with the parliamentary
situation and other developments fav
oring President Wilson's position.
President Wilson firmly reiterated
to house leaders the unyielding posi
tion he outlined last night in his let
ter to Senator Stone.
Former Secretary Bryan's influence
came openly into the fight today when
Representative Bailey of Pennsylvania
gave out a telegram from Mr. Bryan
opposing the president's position and
supporting the agitation in congress.
Lodge Supports President.
Senator Lodge, ranking republican
of the foreign relations committee, de
clared support of the president's posi
tion. Senator Gore, democrat, intro
duced his resolution warning Ameri
cans, and Senator Jones, republican,
introduced a resolution to require a
break in diplomatic relations to be re
ferred to congress. There was no
discussion.
Believe Resolution Would Pass.
President Wilson reiterated his op
position to any action in congress
warning Americans off armed ships in
a conference early today with Speak
er Clark, majority leader Kltchin and
Chairman Flood of the house foreign
affairs committee, and they in turn
told the president that if such a reso
lution were brought to a vote in the
house at this time it would be passed
by a majority of two to one.
The president was unshaken in his
position that congress should take no
action embarrassing his contention
that the rights of Americans on the
seas must be upheld at any cost and
repeated what he had written last
night to Senator Stone.
The house leaders went away tell
ing the president nothing would be.

To Give Jury
Evidence on
Graft Probe
Chicago, Feb. 25. The city civil
service commission inquiry into
charges made by Mrs. Page Waller
Eaton, resigned superintendent of the
bureau of social survey, that Mrs.
Louise Osborne Rowe, commissioner
I of public welfare, had forced her to
split her salary to aid in the support of
Msr. William Hale Thompson's sister,
Mrs. Mivelaz, was resumed this morn
ing. The investigation by the council
committee on schools, fire, police and
civil service was completed yesterday
and the committee recommended that
the evidence be sent to the state's at
torney to be laid before the grand
Jury.
State's Attorney Hoyne said he
would not take the matter up until af
ter the primary election next Tues
day. He will then investigate it thor
oughly he said, and if evidence war
rants, will present it to the grand Jury
for action.
The minority members of the com
mittee have also announced that they
will present a minority report to the
council, and it is said the principal
recommendation of the report will be
that the council ask Mayor Thompson
to discharge Mrs. Rowe.
Mrs. Eaton, in telling her story to
the committee, offered no new devel
opments in the alleged salary split
ting charges. She reiterated that Mrs.
Rowe told her that "Maizie (Mrs
Thompson) says we've got to com&
across," and that for some months she
paid Mrs. Rowe one-third of her sal
ary, ostensibly for the benefit of Mrs.
Mivelaz, sister-in-law of the mayor.
Seymour Stedman, counsel for Mrs.
Eaton, also took the stand and he was
followed by W. E. Rodriguez, social
ist aldermon who brought the charges
of graft on the floor of the council,
and by Fulton Gardner, an electrician,
both of whom said they had seen Mrs.
Eaton pay money to Mrs. Rowe.
Rodriguez and Gardner also appear
ed before the civil service commis
sion, together with a number of minor
employes in the department of public
welfare.
Mrs. Eaton issued a statement to
day declaring any attempt to blacken
her character would be met by resort
to the courts'for redress.
A summons has been issued by the
civil service commission for Mrs. D.
M. Sabin, widow of former United
States Senator Sabin of Minnesota, to
appear as a witness at the Katon
Rowe hearing.
Mrs. Eaton a number of years ago
had business dealings with Senator
Sabin and after his death figured in a
contest over Insurance policies in
which she was made the beneficiary.

PAGEINSTRUCTED
TO MAKE INQUIRY
INTO SEA HOLDUP
Washington, Feb. 25 The United
States today instructed Ambassador
Page at London to make inquiries at
the British foreign office regarding
the removal of 38 Germans, Aus
trians and Turks from the American
steamship China in Asiatic waters,
and to demand the release of the
prisoners if they were arrested on the
high seas, as has been indicated.
Great Britain maintains extra ter
ritorial rights over the waters im
mediately adjacent to Shanghai, the
China's sailing port for San Fran
cisco. Should the British government
set up the claim that the vessel was
within waters under British juris
diction the United States would uot
have cause for further action.
Advices to the state department
leave in doubt the exact position of
the China. One consular report fixed
the location as "ten miles oft shore."
The state department has been ad
vised that the British foreign office is
investigating the incident.

tions for President Wilson, as a demo
cratic candidate, and for United States
Senator Lawrence Y. Sherman already
had been filed.
"I expect a reply within a few days,"

The Petit Parisien's correspondent
at the front says that the great Ger
man offensive against Verdun is under
the personal direction of Emperor
William, who arrived at general head
quarters on Saturday last and who, In.
order that nothing go wrong, immed
iately ordered that a sort of dress re
hearsal of the coming attack be held.
At a given signal, the correspondent
says, every infantryman and gunner
took the post assigned to him in ad

tack were gone through behind the
lines. The emperor seemingly was
satisfied and gave the order to begin
the offensive on Sunday night.
The French losses are declared to
be inslgnlficent in comparison with,
those of the Germans. The German
artillery preparation, which reached
its height on Tuesday, was of unpar
alleled violence. Every inch of ground
was searched out, every point where
it was thought a gun might exist was
littered with shells but the French In
fantry was so well sheltered under
ground and the French guns were so
well hidden that, when the German
batteries grew silent and the German
infantry advanced to the attack.
Frenchmen sprang up from the holes
in the ground and opened a deadly fire
with machine guns, while sheila from
the 75-milIinietre guns flew overhead

the Germans as they plodded doggedly
