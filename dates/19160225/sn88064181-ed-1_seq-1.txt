WOMAN'S MISSION
ARY SOCIETY ELECT
Officers for the Current Year and
Hold Several Very Inmportant
and Enthusiastic Meetings
The Woman's M:i 'sicuary So="
ciety has begun tie :e,'r 19i6i
with a number of cm n :tiastic
meetings, the :irst bei;ig hid
with Mrs. J. J. ieredith, when
the following odice,.s vw:u. d!:.ct
ed for the ensuing, y,.ai·:
Mrs. C. P. Thobrnhiil, p.i
dent; Mrs. A. B. S.vift, I;t vice
president; Mrs. F. \,'vWtun, 2nd
vice-president: Mt's. S. P. Walk
er, Treasurer; Mrs. A. 1). Bridg
er, treasurer home dec,:::rt:ment;
Mrs. J. J. Meredith, recording
secretary; Mars. I. B. aay, cor
responding secretary: .is. ' V.
E. Godfrey, missionary superin
tendent; Mrs. B. H. Redditt,
superintendent of publicity.
The second meeting was with
Mrs. R. R. Redditt and the third
with Mrs. H. H. Rogillio. The
last meeting was held with Mrs.
A. B. Swift on the 16th instant.
There was an unusually large at
tendance and a most interesting
program was giv'en.
At all the meetings plans have
been made for the work of the;
year, and, if enthusiasm and ef-!
forts count, these plans wii.l be
carried out. So it looks as if the
society is going to acco0mplish its
part of the world's work.
The next meeting will occur
Wednesday, March 1, at the
home of Mrs. C. P. Tilornhill.
All members are urged to be
present.
On seeing your letter in the
Caldwell Watchman taking Mr. (
Pine's affidavit as a text will
ask you why you did not quote
it correctly and take it at its
meaning? According to your
own statement you voted for
Mr. McClanahan because you
thought him the best man for
the place. If this is true you
are placing yourself in the atti
tude of being an ignorant voter.
For according to the affidavit
none are accused of being igno
rant voters except those who
could be influenced by Mr. Mc
Clanahan's political shrewdness.
You say "the situation as to
our assessor looks this way to
me" and to give various reasons
whly Mr. Walker should be elect
ed assessor. If this be true why
had you ever thought so serious
ly about supporting Mr. Miller?
I v:te at Clarks precinct and
believe I know something of the
situation there. I believe that
the men at the head of the Lou
isiana Central Lumber Co., are
supporting Mr. Walker but.they
do not by any means control the
vote at Clarks. We gave Mr.
Miller an overwhelming majori
ty but it came from the men
who earn their living by the
sweat of the brow, who compose
over 90 per cent of the vote of
('larks.
Why are these laboring men
voting for Mr. Miller? Because
they know he is their friend.
i They have known him for sever
al years and every time they ask
him for a favor it is freely grant I
ed.
It seems to me that this affida
:vit is for the sole purpose of
creating a prejudice in the i
minds of the people who voted I
for Mr. McClanahan against Mr. t
Miller. This is a question of
vital importance to the citizens i
of Caldwell parish in which all t
prejudice and malace should be E
laid aside. t
I am not attempting to ad ise
who to vote for but just ask that I
all malace be laid aside and a
every man vote his honest con- I
viction, uninfluenced by any man I
or set of men.
Very respectfully,
J. P. Ferguson

LEADING AMERICAN FINANCIER
SUGGESTS WAY OUT OF "lmi
Does Not Advocate Government Ownership of Railroads, but S'::
Government Supervision by Board Selected from Ca:abal:
and Successful Busines.en of America
An interesting article in the
World's Work on the govern
ment and the railrhads by Otto
H. Kahn, of a leading Ameri
can banking house, expresses
some striking and original views.
Mr. Kahn takes the stand that
government regulation of the
transportation lines is prefer
able to governmont ownership,
but declares the present systtm
faulty.
He holds that one national au
thority should have sole charge
or regulating rates and other
matters affecting interstate
lines, and that neither state
legislatures n or commissions
should have jurisdiction over
such carriers, excepting the ex
ercise of certain administrative,
police or public welfare powers
within well defined limits, and
we believe the gentleman is emi
nently correct.
Mr. Kahn enunciates the idea
that the national functions and
character of railroads are analo
gous to those of national banks
and that they should be handled
in the same manner. The same
body which determines earnings
by fixing rates should be charged
with the responsibility of hear
ing and determining wage dis
putes between railroads and the
employes, or if that be not prac
ticable, then the body should
hance the cost of operation such
as legislative enactments like the
Full Crew Law, increased taxa
tion, advance in wages, etc.
The financier also makes the
point that it should be the suc
cessful business man and not the
fatfire, whose a(lie ,.!! ,
sc lht in govenI , .
Yet there is no count 'v \
thw-views of ret!~.:enl:tt .

* TO THE VOTERS
TO I of Caldwell Parish:
and most import
or Assessor is near
Shat. are you going
to lhome,:.or are you
exercise
ask my friends and voters
to gel out on the 29th and give
Mr. WAlker, one of our Caldwell
Parish reared boys, their hearty
support, and not allow him to g,
down in defeat by his opponent
who has drifted in from someT
other part of the state, and ha
,i.. lived in the p)arish a few
i,, ;,il. \\alker has made us
Slud isses.or. and why take
. l:es; n his opponent, who is
, i: ;:v a strangrer to the ma
'i the peIopile in the par.
! ii some work for Mr. WVal
.' in 1he .past, my instruction
t sh(,\ no fav(,rs to any
e, c, i,ration or individual 1
i. t all alike, an'ii list their
i' 't a- the owner values it,
, ':: ,,, he will do justice .J
Sn>!irness to all in the c
' ,_', . if re-elected, as he F
i , i<< the past, I can't say
fry' his i ';- pmnent, but if I
, i _: , ,and all of the vo
s. I know that I tell you some
, ut 1 Iam unable to seE
!i Ievwer wanted to vote so bad
\ in my life, as I do in the ap- t
v,; in: lprii:ary in dear old
ia!d i,,ci. bit I am not allowed I
S,, i. that parish.
It is not my wishes that I am
,iving in Ouachita; I loig ways:
prefe r my home parish as a
place of residence, and if had
,gotten justice in regard to an ap
lointment a few years back, I
\(:lld he living there now. In
e,,ar(l to the above appointment,
many of you know of it, those
who doubt it, will only inquire a
little they can find out all about
it, this is one reason connected
with many more, and for the in
terest of t;l:. farming class of the
!)arislh. I am asking you to sup
port MOr. Walker-the best man
tf the two for the office.
HU is honest and efficient and
has said that he will refund cer
tain commissions back to the
school fund if re-elected, while
his opponent went through the
" t ojmary without mentioning
e -i~itri' of anly coinInfs
• o',s. We know it is not from
lis eart that he makes such
)r(.mises. Now if it had have
i1en he would have made it one
of his campaign.
Now, friends and voters, I
warn you to pay no heed to the
Miller campaign circulars that
he or some of his friends are
sending or will send out over
the parish trying to decoy to the
polls for his interest the good
people of the parish.
Hope on the 29th all of you
will turn out to your voting place
and cast your ballot for S. P.
Walker, who will treat all alike
in regard to assessing against
one who represents one of tl':
larest *oneearI ti the b `h :..
iope aill of you have read or
will read Mr. Irvine's letter pub
lished in the last issue of the
Watchman, and on the morning
of the primary let the good news
be hurled through the land that
Mr. Walker has succeeded him
self by a tremendous majority.
Respectfully,
Iley I. Meredith.
COFFINS, CASKETS
AND
BURIAL ROBES
I have on hand a complete line of Coffins, Caskets and Burial Robes,
which I will sell at the very lowest possible prices in conformity to the
class of goods that I handle.
When the Grim Reayer visits the home, those bowed down in grief are unable to attend
to the details and I make a specialty of the work of supplying everything that is needed
and at reasonable prices.

The gentlemen are at Grayson
now but will return to Columbia
tomorrow to spend Saturday and
Sunday after which they will de
part for Lake Providence to ad
just rates there.
