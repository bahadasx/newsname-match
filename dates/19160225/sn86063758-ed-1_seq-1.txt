$> <5^ <$> 3> <?><?><$> <s>
I have been reading the papers a lit- :
tic reeentlv. Ve>. sir. reading about
] what our legislature lias been doing.;
I Did you see where some fellow wrote
an article for The Record in which it
was stated that a number of the members
had not even read the prohibition
or liquor bill, which ever you want to
call it?1 reckon liquor bill would be
a better name for it?just think about
those whom we send down there to
legislate for us passing such an important
law as a liquor law and not
even reading it to see what it contained.
It is wonderful. That would have been
a great joke if they had let that section
10 remain in the law by which
every one who had even a small .bit of
tiie stuff in his grip would have had
label tlie grip. The fellow with the
labeled grip would have had a great
time uoing up and down the State with
a label on his grip telling the people
wherever he went that he had a little
bit of booze therein, and the way he
would have had friends would have
been a caution. You know, I somehow
have my doubts about the sentiment in
this State being so overwhelmingly in
i favor of prohibition anyway. I am in
I - *
dined to think that the overwhelming
sentiment in favor of prohibition is
prohibition for the other fellow, and
the prohibitionist will order his own.
One member said he understood the
-entiirent to be for the gallon-a-month.
Vnd I guess -he i> about right. But it
all suits me fine. They have provided
for the 60 pints of beer a month and
that is enough and I wouldn't have
cared if they had cut out all other
hoozc. However, v.e must all admit
that there is very little real prohibition
r^out it. T am one who believes that
?iw. -,i Mm? of temnerance would be
promoted by the use of good beer and
H"ht wines, aftd that it would be bettei
for the human system than to use
so much dope.
I have often wondered why a man
when he was elected to the legislature
was so keen to legislate about the personal
rights and privileges of his fellows.
He is just an ordinary human
being like the rest of us?or rather he
' - ?Knf cnm^how
was vvnen ne \\ as cicv.n.u
after lie gets there?that is. some of
'em?seems to have become suddenly
imbued with the idea that it is his burden
and solemn and imperative duty to regulate
everything by law for the rest of
humanity. He has suddenly gotten a
new vision and feels the duty resting
on him to make laws to regulate the
conduct of his one time equals, but now
his inferiors and incapable of taking
care of themselves. I say that is the
?" . ccvnptimf4';.
J way 11 appcais iu m\.
think I can recall one man that I heard
->f who was so impressed with the responsibility
and the burden, and his
wisdom, that he not only had the county
he came from to tote, but that old
atlas was bearing down on his shoulders.
and he is beginning to stoop just
a little under the load. It is not right
to impose such burdens upon those
whom we elect to make laws for us,
->"'1 i -n-n in fnvor of relieving many
<11111 1 U U I *4. - _ _
)f them of this heavy load, and let us
see if we cannot have it done without
regulating everything from taking a
glass of beer to riding on a free pass.
But I notice that the governor is pleasi
ed with the results of the work of the
recent session of the legislature, and
I reckon it is all right. The tax levyhas
been reduced a half mill, but what
puzzles me is how we are going to payback
all that money the borrowing committee
is authorized to borrow. I reckon
it is to be paid without increasing the
levy or the appropriation by continuing
to borrow. If it is we must all commend
the business ability and sagacity
of the legislature.
But let's talk about something else. I
v/as reading a paper the other day, and
r came across a little poem that sounds

*
SELL YOUR HAMMER AND BUY
A HORN.
Yes. sell your hammer and sell it cheap,
If the thing won't sell, then bury it
deep,
For though living's high, and times afe
tough,
The market has more than hammers
enough.
Get a big horn and key it in G,
Then blow, "All's right/' with a yessir-re.
If the clouds hang low give a vigorous
toot,
When the game goes slow is the time
to "root."
<3r
Shorlrl a rrntich come along witk St
song forlorn,
Just drown him out with your jubilant
horn.

No battle is won 'round a flag that is

! Xow that sounds pretty good to me.
How does it sound to you, kind reader?
If you have a hammer and can't sell
it, suppose you bury it so deep that no
one can find it. And I -have been told
that there are several otherwise very
good people in Newberry who have
hammers, and that they do not permit
them to rust for want of use. Bury
'em, and bury 'em deep. Blow your
horn! Whiltle Do anythinfi but knock. I
reckon I am a sort of an?well, a peculiar
sort of person? but I never

much bettter it they said pleasant and
nice things, or bridled their tongues and
said mum is the word. I reckon though
that they get some sort of pleasure out
, of it all. I hope so. but I believe that
the time will come in their lives that
they will see the error of their way. Puf
up your hammer. Bury it. Blow a
horn. Whistle if you must. But when
vnti dn make a noise?make joyful

noise. Tune your old bugle or bag pipe,
to the notes that make for the betterment
of your own community. If you
