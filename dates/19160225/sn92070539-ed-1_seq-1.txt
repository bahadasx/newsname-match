According to reMrts of battle
between sheriff's posse and the
lleelng prisoners, Stephens was

posse, was shot in the head, but
not seriously wounded, the bnl
let grazing Ills skull. Joe
Cranston, one of tho escaped
prisoners, was killed during the
light between the otiicurs and
criminals, and J. O Starr, anoth
er member of the gang, badly
wounded. Threo othur prison
era escaped under tho rain of
leaded bullets from guns of the
possemen, who then, for the time
being, turned their attention to
the two victims of the posse,
Stephens and Sevier.
The two prisoners concerned
in lliebkitle, made their escape
Sunday morning from the Dem
Ing jail after making City Mar
shall Tabor a prisoner, taking a
number of guns and ammunition
from tho arsenal and securing a
Kord automobile from a local

Dasbly, alleged forger, and Joe
Cranston, a vagrant.
City Marshall Tabor entered
the jail and Schmidt, asked him
the privilege of going to tho cor
rldor. The door was unlocked
and lie entered the hallway,
Schmidt soon returned to his
cell and asked ttie officer to un
lock it so ho could enter. As
Tabor started to unlock tho door
S-:hmldt pinned his hands be
hind him and the other prisoners
hurried to his assistance. The
officer was thrown to the lloor
and later locked in the cell. His

One of tho men then called up
the garage and asked the pro
prletor to send a machine to the
jail fully provided with gasoline
and tires for a long trip. The
prisoner stated that the sheriff
wanted the car to take a Bick
prisoner to Fay wood Springs
Tho ruse worked.
D. O. Snodgrass, one of the
proprietors of the garage, drove
a car to the jail and was at once
admitted. Ho was covered with
revolvers, held by tho live men
and locked in a cell with Tabor.
The telephone wiros wore out
and the live men entered the
automobile.
It is said Cranston did not
want to enter the machine, but
as ho was the only man in the
party who could operate a car
lie was told that if lie did not
consent to drive them he would
be shot.
About an hour later a Mexican
woman wlios husband was a
prisoner In the jail, called. Tabor
and Snodgrass told her to notify
tho sheriff of the escape of the
prisoners. She immediately
called at the sheriff's house and a
posse was quickly formed and
chase was started. Automobiles
were secured and a number of
machines in which members of
the Doming company of National
Guard, deputies and civilians
rode, took up tho pursuit.
Wlille they were eating lunch
among tho foothills a mile north
enst of Hincon, slortly before
o'clock Sunday af ernoon I lu
ll ve escaped prisoners were dls
covered unexpectedly by the
posse iieaded by Sheriff Stephens.
The membe rs of the posse had
stopped their machine to make a
tour of the country when they
suddenly ran onto the fugitives
near their car, eating lunch. The
bandits were on a sharp bluff
above and immediately opened
tire on the posse.
In the fighting that followed
the sheriff was killed, Buck
Sevier was wounded in the head
by one of the bandits, Joe Crans
ton, one of the escaped prisoners
was killed, and J. O. Starr, an
other member of the gang, badly
wounded. The other three men
escaped.
Reinforced by additional
posses from Doming and a posse
headed by Sheriff Felipe Lucero,
of Dona Ana county, the three
ileelng prisoners were hunted
throught Sunday night and Mon
day and reports were that they
all probably would bo recaptur

Some people knock the poor old world,
And say it's getting worse;
Some long for golden gates impearlcd,
As per the scripture verse;
But this world is what you make it,
And despite old Adam's fall,
Somehow it seems a good old world
To live in, after all.
There may be lots of shadders here,
And sorrow all around, i
But if you arc looking for good cheer,
There's plenty to be found;
There's the music of the waters,
And the bobolink's glad call,
And somehow, it's a good old world
To live in, after all.
Of all God's creatures man alone
Is sad and discontent,
And seems to think he ought
The whole big firmament.
The birds and bees and butterflies,
And beasts and things that crawl
Believe that it's a good old wi
To live in, after all.
