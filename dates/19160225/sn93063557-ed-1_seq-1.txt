JUDGE WEEKS ADDRESSES
BROTHERflOOD.
The Morrisville Messenger of Febru
16 contains the following account ofan
address delivered by the Hon. John E.
Weeks in that town:
Those who failed to hear Judge
and Speaker J. E. Weeks of Middle
bury Sunday night at the Union
Brotherhood meeting, failed to hear
a most interesting talk. Judge
Weeks makea no pretenso to being
an orator, but he can and does intereat
and hold his audiences and he did
Sunday night. Thia is because he
never talka unless he haa something to
say; something that hc is vitally in
terested in and believes in whole
heartedly. Hia aubject-What Shall
We Do With Our State Charges,
meaning those who have spent a term
at Windsor or Rutland at State expense,
is one on which he can speak from long
experience as he has been on the State
Penal Board f( r many years, and is the
author of many of the humane methods
that have so changed conditions in
thoae institutiona for the better, both
for State and inmatea. "
