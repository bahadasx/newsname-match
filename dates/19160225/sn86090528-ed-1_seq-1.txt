LONDON, Feb. 21 An unconfirmed

A dispatch stated that the German

does not want a break: in diplomatic

The German foreign office, accord

the Vnited States to specify what size
gun it deems necessary for defense
purposes. In this manner, it is be
lieved, Germany hopes to force from
the 1'nited States state department
such an exact definition of armament
that it may prove embarrassing to the
owners of belligerent ships which have

It is believed also that Germany

WORKING
ON ROADS
OF COUNTY
Grading South of Rush Springs is Being !
Rushed and Camp Will Next Be
Moved West; Convicts are
Employed
The work which was. yesterday re
ffumed on the county roads, near Rusn
Springs, promises to continue until
several miles of good roads are con
structed in that section, following
which, it is understood road building
will be taken up in other sections
and pushed through gradually until
roads all over Grady county will have
teen put in goodi fhape.
The work, as it is now being done
does not call for macadamizing-or top
dressing with any material whatever
The roads will, for the present, be
graded, thrown to a crown in the cen
ter, with ample ditches on either side
to carry off the water following heavy
rainfalls.
At present the county road gang ia
completing the work begun soma
months since on a piece of roadway
south ot Rush Springs. This section
of road extends from Rush Sprints
south, for a distance cf seven and
one-half miles. Five miles of this road
had been graded when the road gung
was pulled off, on account of nou
avEuIiLlIity of funds, before Christmas.
The remaining two miles will he im
mediately completed, and turned over
to the puhlio.
The county clerk states that as soon
as this work shall have been complet
ed the county commissioners! will or
der the road gang moved to a camp
to he located west of Rush Springs,
where work on what is known as the
uusn springs-fclgm road will com
mence. This road leads west to El
gin, Just across the line in Caddo
county, where it intersects the main
north and south road running between
Anadarko and Lawton. The distance
to be worked on this road will be ap
proximately eight miles and will follow
the section hue due west.
The work is being done under the
superintendency of the county en
gineer, with Nim Wyatt in charge as
loreman. County prisoners are used
as laborers, while the grader is pulled
by a large oil tractor. Many teams
are also said to be at work in this
piece of rond building. The teams,
however, are not county teams', hut are
the property of farmers living along
the lines, or near the lines of highway
being constructed and are being used
to work out donations of those farm
ers and Isnd cwners to the good roads'
cause, ,

(United Prest Staff Correspondent.)
WITH THE FRENCH ARMY IN
ALSACE, Jan 20 (By Mail.) A feud
in the middle of a big w ar, that is what
this position of Hartsmannsweillerkof
is; a feud just like they have down
in Breathit county, Kentucky. For
French officers will admit and so wil'
German officers, that this position on
the western battle front has no mors
and no less importance than scores
of other points elsewhere between the
sea and Switzerland.
Every few days the French and Ger
man communiques mention scrapping;
on the knob in the Vosges mountains
known as "Old Armand," or Harts
manswelllerkr.pf. One might imagine
that the side holding this crest held
the key to Paris or to Berlin. It la
not so. It's simply the feud going on.
each side determined to have the hon
or of holding the top of the mountain.
It is like the struggle about a flag;
matter of pride in taking and hold
ing- ,
The quarrel began exactly a year
ago. A r na'l detachment of French
Chasseurs established au advance post
on the summit cf Hartsmannswciller-
kopf. They were surprised by a larger
force, surrounded and beaten. Thin
was on January 15, 1913,
Fortifying the position strongly as
an observation point, the Germans held
the crest until March 23, when the
French stormed the hill, took the
trenches at the top, captured 10 offi
cers, 34 noncoms and 313 men, all
wounded.
Early in April the Germans recap
tured part of the lost trenches, but
he French, on April 6, charged again,
took all they had lost, together with
the big rock on the far side of the
tummit.
Humiliated, the Germans prepared a
counter attack which they launched
April 26, taking everything back to and
including the summit where they fever
ishly set to work organizing the posi
tion so it would be stronger than ever
All night they worked, but with dawn
came the Blue devils, as the Alpine
Chausseurs are called, swarming up
the precipitous slopes of "Old Annad,"
and despite machine guns, rifle firs
and bayonets, they reached the top
and put the Germans to rout once
more. Immediately the Germans tried
lo rally but failed, though they estab
lished trenches within seven yards ot
those of the French at the top.
Throughout the summer the littlo
war in the middle of the big war kept
going, first the Germans gaining a
lection of tnnch at this point or that,
then the B'rench driving them out and
taking a corresponding slice of the
German trenches a bit lower down the
slope.
On September 9, the Germans, after
a period of comparative calm, slam
med home a surprise attack and retook
the summit. The French, undismay
ed, came back at the Germans the
same night and in the dark fought
like the blue demons feople called
them. They retook their trenches and
many German dead were left behind.
The same thing happened all over
again October 13 when the kaiser's
men sent wave after wave against
the bitterly contested mountain top,
finally tak'ng the whole works, driv
ing the French back down the hill In.
the direction of France. But on Octo
ber 16 the French came tearing un
the hill again and drove the German i
out.
The Germans came back In Decem
ber several times, gaining a foothold
but just before Christmas the French
drove them back with heavy losses,
includl-!? n srly 1,100 prisoners. Two
