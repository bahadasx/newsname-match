The Car that Cuts the Cost, of
J UPKEEP
This High Grade Automobile is in reality a $500 car, selling for $380. 'Carefdlly
compare the specifications with cars selling for 1000 and upwards and you will realize the
truthfulness of the above statement. Here's the real question confronting you, "When
I can get a
MOB1LETTE FOR
; why should I pay more fof car that is larger, tHt weighs more, that costs more to main
tain, that requires more storage room, that is n. cumhersome to operate, thatdoet not
possess the easy riding qualities, that gives me a., 'tie or less comfortable testing space
and that can not take me any place where the Mo ;tte will not go with equal or greater
speed and safety?" Practical business men have long realized that the automobils was
giving too little service for the money expended in first cost and cost of operation. They
have realized that using of two tons of vehicle in order to transport two persona is far
from economy and long way from real efficiency. The business man who wishes to save
the expense and depreciation of his heavy machine is provided a car in Woods Mobsletto
that reduces the cost of maintenance in proportion to the reduction in the load, at the
same time retaining every requisite of good appearances and dignity. It also affords the
luxury of motoring to those to whom the cost of maintaining a heavy automobile would
be prohibitive. Gasoline prices are still soaring and Woods Mobilette will ever continue
to give 40 to 50 mUes per gallon. Woods Mobilette is as comfortable, faster and much
uaneier to operate man any previous transportation vehicle. It i6 the maximum
formance type of road vehicle and its introduction has created a startling sensation.
