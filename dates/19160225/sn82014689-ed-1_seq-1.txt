cord Cy HamakuapoKo Students In
Inter-Island Contest 13 Prizes
In All.
First prize Herbert S. Wells
Second prize Virginia Elizabeth Mc
Con key.
Third prizes Annie Walker, Irene
Kaiulanl Wells, and Constance Rose.
Through a special wireless mess
age to the Maui News, last Monday
afternoon, the first news of the sue
success of Maui High School pupils in
capturing the highest prizes of the
citizenship essay contest, reached
here. Although there was much
pleased enthusiasm among the young
essayists and their friends, there was
also some doubt at first as to the cor
rectness of the report. That Maui
High should win not only the one
first prize, and one of the two second
prizes offered, but also three of the
ten third prizes, seemed too good to
be true.
Herbert S. Wells, winner of the
first prize in the student group, Is a
member of the senior class.and Is
one of the best students In the High
School. He is the son of Principal
H.M.Wells, of the Paia public school.

who shares with Kathryn I. Lyman,
of the Hilo High School.the second
honors, is the daughter of Dr.W.F.
McConkey. She is a member of
the junior class.
Of the Maui winners of third prizes,
Annie Walker of the 6enior class, is
the daughter of E. J. Walker, of Paia;
Irene Kaiulanl Wells, of the sophmore
class, is the daughter of W. I. Wells,
of Haiku, and is a cousin of Herbert
Wells; while Constance Rose, of the
junior class, is a Paia girl.
The prizes were offered by the Sons
and Daughters of the American Revo
lutlon.and were open to all students
in the territory. The first prize is $10;
the two second prizes, $5 each; and
the third prizes, $2 each.
All the essays were entitled, "The
True American Citizen", and their
merits were judged by a board com
posed of Judge W. L. Whitney,
Mrs. Wade Warren Thayer, and Rev.
Frank S. Scudder.

Hart Case Will Be
Feature Of Term
Grand And Trial Jurors Drawn For
March Circuit Court Examination
Of Clerk's Books Still In Progess.
Grand and trial juries for the
March term of the second circuit
court, were drawn on Thursday. The
grand jurors are to report on March
15, and tse trial jurors on March 20.
So far as is known now the criminal
term will not be particularly heavy,
and the grand jury will probably fin
ish its work quickly. Investigation
of the shortage of $6000 to $10,00U ot
the court funds, for which the former
clerk Edmund K. Hart is held to be re
sponsible, will be the most important
work of the body. The work of exam
ining Hart's books is still in progress
and the results of this will be placed
in the grand jury's hands. It is sta
ted that the careful checking by J. N.
K. Keola is not tending to minimize
the amount of the shortage.
Failure to record funds paid out, as
well as those received, as indicated by
the finding of receipts taken by Hart
for several hundred dollars, shows
that the former clerk's methods were
extremely lax.
There will probably be a fairly hea
vy term of civil business and jury
waived cases.

BILL WILL HURT CANNERIES
If House Bill No.8234, now pend
ing in congress goes through, it will
probably cause considerable inconven
ience to the pineapple canneries. This
is a measure to prevent child labor

commerce to almost all products pro
duced in whole or part, through the
labor of children under 14 years of
age.or of children between 14 and 16
who work more than 8 hours per day,

Maui Plantations
Make Fine Showing
Pioneer More Than Doubles Last Year's
Profits Wailuku Beats 1914 By
Half Millioh Dollars.
Both the Wai'.uku and the Tioneer
plantations jnade remarkably good
showings for the past year, according
to reports of the managers made at
the annualmeetings just held. The
Wailuku Sugar Company's net profits
amounted to $877,641, which was al
most half amillion dollars more than
for the previous year. Dividends of
20 per cent, or$600,000 were paid. The
yield in sugar was 19,177 tons against
16,000 for 1914. In spite of the recent
sorm damage, Manager Penhallow ex
pects to harvest a 17,000 ton crop du
ring the present year.
The Pioneer Mill Company made net
profits of $1,514,305 during 1915, or
more than double that of 1914, when
$607,598 was made. Twenty per cent
or $800,000 was paid in dividends. Al
though the first estimates of the crop
were for but 27,000 tons of sugar 33,
229 tons were actually produced.
This was the banner crop of the plan
tation. The estimate for this year is
31,500 tons. Manager Weinzheimer
emphasizes the importance of quick
harvesting, and is bending his efforts
to still further increasing efficiency
along this line.
St. Anthony's To Be
Greatly Enlarged
Plans Call For Big Addition To Cost
$12,000 Work Of Raising
Amount Has Begun.
Plans have been made for a $12,000
enlargement of St. Anthony's Catholic
church, in Wailuku, and already the
congregation is at work raising the
funds for the structure. Father Jus
tin, who returned from Honolulu last
week, where he consulted architects
regarding the matter, says that the
improvements will add about 60 feet
to the old church, which will be thoro-
ly reconstructed. When completed
the church will be in the form of a
cross. The presen structure was built
44 years ago, and has long since be
come inadequate to accomodate the
increased membership. The church
building commitloei will meet next
Sunday to consider the plans and ways
and means of providing for the cost.
An entertainment, to be given at the
Wailuku Orpheum on Thursday, March
9, has already been arranged for help
ing this fund and the affair promises
to be a big success.
Two Loose Ball Games
Played Last Sunday
The boys had a kind of an off day
last Sunday and did not come up to
expectations. The Chinese beat the
Asahis in the first game by the score
of 9 to 2, while the Waikapus had the
edge on the Saints by the score 16 to8.
Keehu, the best pitcher of the Saints
did not appear on the diamond in u
niform as it is claimed that he had a
sore arm and is resting for the com
ing championship series.
Next Sunday the Chinese and Wai
kapus will play in the first game and
at 3.00 o'clock the Asahis and the
Saints will play.
Geo. H. Cummlngs umpired the game
to the satisfaction of the fans and
the) boys.
MAY RAISE FLY QUARANTINE
Because the life history of the
Mediterranean fruit fly has now been
definitely ascertained, Dr.E. A. Back,
entomologist of the department of
agriculture believes that it will soon
be possible for the quarantine regula
tions against many Hawaiian fruits
and vegetables to be raised. Dr
Back who has been studying the fly
for the past two and a half years, is
about to return to Washington. Ho
states that it has been conclusively
demonstrated that refrigeration for
fruits infested with the fly larvae kills
the Insects.

New Auto Ordinance
Being Tested In Court
A number of penal summonses
were issued last week for automo
bile drivers who had failed to take out
licenses under the new ordinance
which went into effect the first of the
year. A test case was made of that
of W. H. Field, who was fined $5 by
District Magistrate McKay, and it
will be carried to the Supreme Court.
It is held by those opposing the ord
inance that to require a holder of a
driver's license to take out another
permit, for which he must pay $3 and
place himself in the position of a
beginner, is not sound law. The
case is being fought by Case and Vin
cent for the defendant. County Attor
ney Bevins handling the territory's
side.

II. B. Wel'.er and John VaBcohcellos,

eellos will devote his time to his pos
ition as master mechanic of the Kahu
lui railroad. Mr. Pharos for about a
year was manager of the Wailuku Or
pheum, associated with the Popular
Theater of Honolulu, and made the
house an exceedingly popular one,
For the past yean- he has been with
his family on the coast, engaged in
theatrical work. He is expected to re
turn to the Is'ands by the next Lur
line, due in Honolulu on March 7.

court, last week settled a case of con
siderable importance and interest on

ney D. H. Case, and others. The high
