The Farmers' School of In
structionReport of First
Two Days by Mr. T. B.
Chandler.
At 1:30 p. m. on Monday Prof. S.
T. Simpson spoke for one hour on
"Pure Bred Beef Cattle", and his first
plea was to gradually eliminate all
scrub cattle, and as fast as possible
reach out and get hold of the pure
breds and increase their numbers on
the farm as fast as possible, for, he
said: "The day is not far distant
when all beef cattle will be blooded
stock on all farms that produce beef
of any kind." He then spoke of the
rich lands of Saline, Pettis, Platte,
Atchison and other counties, and of
the many fine herds of fine breeds of
the State that roam over those fine
farms by the thousands. He also
stated that the beef cattle men of
these counties are among he wealth
iest farmers of our State, and al
though the cattle men have their ups
ad downs the same as other men, he
assured us all that the beef cattle
ansiness is about the surest founds,
tioji for the would-be ucceasful farm
Last Day of r -
er. He described how farmers should
build "creeps" out in the pasture for
the calves that run with their moth
ers all the time. These "creeps" are
made about 16 feet square with a
trough in the center, in which grain
is placed. A stout post is placed at
each corner of the square and one
midway between each corner post,
then rails (2x4) are nailed on top of
the posts 3 1-2 feet high and pickets
nailed to the rails wide enough apart
that the calves can creep in and cat
and leave the mother out.
At 3 p. m., Prof. P. B. Barker
spoke on Tillage and Pasture Man
agement, and exhibited a table which
showed where a field was planted to
corn continually for 20 years and on
ly produced an average of 15 bushels
per acre. Also in the same table he
showed where land right beside it,
but was treated to a five year rota
tion of corn, oats, soy beans, wheat
and clover, produced corn at the av.
erage rate of 51 bushels per acre for
20 years', and another plot at the
same place treated to three year ro
tation of corn, wheat and clover,
produced corn at the rate of 60 bush
els per acre for 20 years. He also

said that pastures to do their best
must receive attention and receive a
good dressing of manure the same
as other fields.
Tuesday morning the discussions
opened by a fine address on Insects
Injurious to Farm Crops, by Prof. T.
J. Talbert; and his first convincing
argument showed that much of the
vast damage done to farm crops by
insects were often charged to floods,
dry weather, etc. He stated that the
value of Missouri farm crops are
$180,000,000 annually, and that all
scientific farm men agree that the
annual loss to the farm crops of Mis
souri by these injurious insects is
fully ten per cent, or $18,000,000 an
nually; and simplest of all he de
clared that more than three-fourths
of all this vast destruction could be
prevented by educational knowledge
so as to use preventive measures. He
stated that the Hessian Fly alone in
one single county in Missouri has of
ten killed the wheat crop to the val
ue of $75,000 to $100,000 in one year,
and all because the farmers used no
preventive measure to stop the rav
ages of this one pest; and the al
most absolute control of this fly can
"MEN ARE SCARCE
DEMAND FOR MORE"
Another 10 Percent Bonus "Largest
Wages Ever Paid in St. Francois
County"
This is the burden of a telegram
from the Lead Belt sent to the city
papers this week in connection with
the information that another 10 per
cent bonus had been added to the
wages of miners on pay day last
week.
It may not be generally known and
yet it is a fact that for some time the
foreign labor in the Lead Belt has
been gradually drifting Eastward
and from Crystal City as well to
secure employment in the great steel
mills that are flooded with orders and
need men. Labor goes where wages
beckon it. This is true of alien labor
in our midst as well as of the Amer
ican. When this alien labor was brought
into the Lead Belt, it was said that
the American laborer would not do
the work that the alien labor would
do it was too independent, the work
was too rough or degrading, or
something, to suit him. Perhaps, at
the wages the alien labor was willing
to do it.
Wages in the Lead Belt were not
as attractive as they were in sonic
of the other mining districts of the
West. The comparisons have fre
quently been made. Experienced
American miners began to leave as
alien labor was brought in. Some
of them went to Joplin, and in that
district you will now find many who
once worked in the Lead Belt of St.
Francois county. Their leaving gave
the companies no uneasiness; their
places could be easily filled with alien
labor, men who would do the hardest
ami most trying work down in the
bowels of the mines at nominal wages.
But now this alien labor has caught
on to something that has attracted its
attention, and it is leaving to lay hold
of it. These aliens have, nothing to
hold them, no attachment to location,
no permanent homes buildefl up to
absorb their affections, no love of
State or country. They work for wag
es alone, live as economically as they
were taught from necessity to live in
the lands of their birth, and the mon
ey order records of our post offices
and the foreign exchanges of our
banks will show how the residue of
their wages go regularly back to
their old homes. And where this is
the case, they must dream of the time
when they can follow it and live in
ease in their characteristic way at
their old homes, whose ties of family
and tradition appeal to them.
The American laborer in his place,
with encouraging wages, would save
and build him a home and habitation,
be most successful by simply sow
ing the wheat after the fly is dead.
The date for sowing wheat here in
our county and all along east and west
of us is to sow not earlier than Oc
tober 10th. Also a rotation of crops
is another great help. He advised
not to burn off the wheat stubble to
try to kill the fly, as the fly is so low
on the stubble and so near the soil
that oi.Iy a few of the fly would be
killed, and the fine mulch to petect
your clover and enrich your land
would be thus destroyed and to no
effect. He stated also that the fly
only attacks three kinds of grain
wheat, rye and barley, and does not
attack oats. He also cautioned the
farmers not to destroy their rotation
of crops to get rid of the fly, becauso
rotation helps to destroy the fly,
lather than encourage it. He stated
that the remedy for joint worm in
wheat is rotation of crops, and for
the army worm a poisoned bran mash
scattered in their path and also the
dust ditch and the log dragged back
and forth several times per day to
kill them and to prevent them from
crossing the ditch.
At 11 a. m., F. W. Faurrot gave a
most practical talk on Spray and
Spray Mixtures, and he was not long
in convincing his eager listeners that
most of the old family orchards over
the country in their neglected condi
tion are but little more than breed
ing places for all manner of insects
and pungoid diseases. His argu
ment was that twenty of the best va
rities of apple trees of the earliest,
midsummer and long-keeping kinds
rear his family in comfort and with
the advantages which American in
stitutions afford, help support and
build up the community in which he
lives, loyal to his home, his communi
ty, his State and his country a typ
ical, proud American citizen. You
find many of them in the Joplin dis
trict, where alien labor is not tolerat
ed and encouraged, and where a shov
eler in the mines it is said gets about
$6.85 for the same amount of tonnage
that he gets $2.65 or $2.85 for in the
Lead Belt. And operators in that dis
trict think he is worth it.
A short time ago, with lead at an
abnormally high price, the companies
in the Lead Belt gave their employes
a ten per cent bonus of their wages.
It was heralded as a generous thing;
but it has not stopped the outflow of
alien labor, and on pay day last week
another ten-per cent bonus was hand
ed each employe with his wages; and
the St. Louis papers of Monday con
tained a telegram telling of it with
the addendum that "this constitutes
the largest wages ever paid in St.
Francois county." This same tele
gram also bears the information that
"men arc scarce and there is a demand
for more."
Hasn't this more to do with the ad
ditional ten-percent bonus than the
fact that lead is selling at $6.25?
And will the "scarcity of men and the
demand for more" be answered by
men who arc getting better wages at
Joplin and other Western mining
sections than the mines of St. Fran
cois county ai receiving with the
bonuses ; ddi i
' NET INCOME OF $3.40,96
The directors of the St. Joseph
Lead Company at a meeting held in
New York last Monday, made a re
port for the year 1016, ending Decem
ber 31st, showing a gross income of
four million, three hundred and ninety-two
thousand three hundrod and
sixty dollars ($4,392,360), an income
over the preceding year of $1,964,
674, and a NET income of three mil
lion four hundred and eighty-nine
thousand nine hundred and sixty-four
dollars($3,489,964). The surplus for
the year amounted to $1,998,883
nearly two million dollars. A quar
terly dividend of two and a half per
cent was declared and the stock of the
company placed definitely on a 10 per
cent annual dividend basis, an in
crease of 4 per cent. Ben Blewitt, a
son-in-law of the late Mr. and Mrs.
C. B. Parsons, was elected a director
to succeed R. S. Parsons.
well cared for would give a thousand
per cent more satisfaction and better
fruit, as well as some satisfactory
money returns, than 5 and 10 times
that number left to all the ravages of
the insects. He stated that no rem
edy has been discovered yet for the
control of pear blight.
At 1:30 Prof. T. J. Talbert gave
another one of his convincing lectures
on Animal and Poultry Pests. Here
he again showed beyond a doubt that
much of the loss in live stock is
caused by insects that can easily be ;
controlled; and here as in the great j
loss to farm crops by injurious in
sects, the loss is attributed to some
unknown disease. And yet these in- j
sect pests can be easily controlled and
the loss mostly prevented easily if
the farmers would only educate them
selves to know how to use the sim
ple means of prevention. He show
ed that warbles in the backs of cows
cause such distressing pain that the
flow of milk in dairy cows is often
cut off fully one-fourth when the backs
of the dairy cows are badly infested
with these easily controlled pests.
The simplest remedy to get rid of
the worble is, when your cattle are
gentle, to fasten them in some in
closed place and cut or squeeze them
out, and be sure and kill each wor
ble when squeezed out or it will work
itself right down into the soil and
soon come out a full grown fly and
ready to lay eggs again. Lice and
mites weaken all kinds of stock, in
cluding chickens, and then in this
weakened condition diseases of all
kinds are invited and run riot; and
TO REVIVE
HOUCK LINE
Frisco Officials Here Tuesday
to Get Line-Up on Work Nec
essary to Bring Road to Life
A special car, carrying a number
of Frisco officials, arrived in Farm
ington Monday evening over the
electric line, and spent part of Tues
day looking ovor the field that the
old "Houck" railroad was intended to
supply. They were accompanied here
by Dr. J. P. Clark, of Perryville, and
were joined here by Sheriff J. C. Wil
liams, W. R. Lang and Peter Giessing,
and shown over Farmington. They
were also driven through the Lead
Belt in automobiles, where they had
a sort of bird's-eye view of the won
derful productiveness of that section.
They appeared to be well pleased
with the prospects of business for
this line of road, were it put in con
dition to handle business promptly
and efficiently. While these officials
did not state positively what kind
of a report would be made to their
road as a result of their visit here,
the impression was given that it would
be favorable to rehabilitating this
old line, which has never yet had the
necessary capital or management be
hind it to put it on its feet.
Just what the plans of the Frisco
will be after taking over this road
has not yet been given out, but what
ever they may be, the old "Houck"
road will probably soon be brushed
up and made a prosperous branch of
that system -possibly a main line.
This road passes through one of the
most fertile sections of country in the
State, and the one reaon it hai failed
to "make good" in the past seems to
have been lack of financial aid.
The relialiii;' in .rtris road will
be of much importance to Farming
ton and community, even though it
should not be extended west beyond
this point, which is its present ter
minus. It appears altogether likely,
however, that when the Frisco takes
active possession of this line that it
will soon be extended westward to
connect with the main line of that
road.
Among the Frisco officials here
Tuesday were: C. H. Claiborn, Super
intendent; F. G. Jonah, Chief Engi
neer; F. C. Riley, assistant Freight
Traffic Manager, and his secretary, F.
C. Riley; Mr. Berry, Division Engi
neer; E. Hagenback, General Agent;
R. H. Schultz, General Manager C.
G. & N. Ry., and Mayor Brooks, of
Cape Girardeau.
Big Cut in Pork
As the electric car for Flat River,
leaving Farmington at 6:34 Sunday
evening, approached the power sta
tion, it met with an antagonist for
right of way in the person of an enor
mous red sow, weighing 350 or 400
pounds. The car, however, had the
advantage of a direct movement,
while the hog was ranged crosswise,
so that the latter was the greatest
sufferer from the contact.
The hog was severed completely in
twain, while the car was derailed,
though aside from quite a severe jolt,
none of the passengers or crew were
injured. The derailment compelled
the sending of another car over to
Flat River. On its return the track
still was not cleared, which compelled
the passengers to walk in from the
power station, which was probably
for their good, though somewhat ruf
fling to their feelings.
For several weeks past Sheriff J. C.
Williams has been a great sufferer
from carbuncles on the back of his
neck. For some time his condition
was quite critical, as the carbuncles
appeared to resist all forms of treat
ment. They appear now practi
cally to have run their course, after
having been twice lanced, and the
many friends of Sheriff Williams art
pleased to see him again actively on
his job and actively attending to his
many duties.
again as usual the loss is charged up
to the weather or something else that
had nothing to do with it. The so
called cattle sprays to keep flies off
in summer will only keep them off
a few hours at a time and never more
than a half day at a time.
