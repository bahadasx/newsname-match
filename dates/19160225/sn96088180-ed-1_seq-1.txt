Tenerlffe, Feb. 25. The German
commerce raider Aloewe harried Brit

tween January 10 and February 1,
according to the captain of one of
the victims which arrived here today.
The captain said that the where
about of the Moewe had been a mys
tery but that between the datea men
tioned he had cruised between 8outh
America and the Brazilian Island of
Fernando de Noronha. r
The Moewe encountered the 4,636
ton British steamor Flamenco while
the latter was heading for Valaparlso.
This veaso tried to escape and wire
lessed for help, but she waa over
taken and aunk by two shots. On
seaman was drowned and two were
wounded.
The captain of the unnamed victim
also related that the Moewe took the
British steamer Cordbrldxe into the
mouth of the Amazon, transferred
her coal and then sank her.
The Moewe has been reported to
be the raider which captured the
Appam, recently taken into Newport
News, Va., aa a prize. It wa thought,
too, that she was responsible for tak
ing the British steamer Weatburn,
which was brought Into the Canaries
this week and later taken out within
the three-mile limit and scuttled.

Bdsre the Beleaguered French City
(By United Press Lessed Wire.)
London, Feb. 25. Though Paris
officially reported today that the vio
lence of the German drive against
Verdun was diminishing, the Berlin
official announcement told of the cap
ture of aix more villages, and thous
ands of prisoners along an eight-mile
front before the city. :
At some points the German crown
prince's men are within two miles of
! their coveted goal. Not only have
,the French wings been driven back
.but the center, too, has ibeen forced
to a point within six- miles ot the
'city. . : '.
j It is s trail of blood the Germans
t$r leaving. Distorted corpses of the
(best fighters of France and Germany
and thousands of wounded are the
battle's harvest.
Berlin said the French tosses had
(been particularly heavy and the Ger
mans lost only what might be ex
acted from the magnitude of the
'struggle.
I The Parts communique, while
'claiming to have checked the Ger
Imanitor "the time being," virtually
'admitted, as Berlin said, that the
( Germans had taken Champ Neuville,
.Beaumont, Ornea and the farms and
villages between, including Cottel
lette, 'Marmont and Chambrettes.
General Joffre, French commander-
ln-ohlef, has taken personal direction
'of the French defense. Paris hails
this enthusiastically, as meaning a
sure turn of fortune.
The apparent contradiction la the
official statements Paris telling of
'a check and a lull in the infantry
and artillery battling, and Berlin re
'potlng fresh gains was probably
due to the fact that the Paris state
ment Is later. The Berlin statement
mont probably covered events of the
early night, after which, as Paris
said, the were no Infantry attacks.
in addition to revealing appalling
losses, Berlin claimed 10,000 pris
oners had already been taken, to
gether with much booty.

ly upon the convening of the senate!
today. Senator Gore introduced bis j
bill making it Illegal for Americans !
to travel upon armed vessels ot the
belligerents during the war, and also
a resolution providing for a warning
to them to refrain from such travel.
A resolution by Senator Jones of
Washington, requesting President
Wilson not to sever diplomatic rela
tions ' with any nation and not to
place America In a position where
she could not honorably avoid war,
was tabled. . .
Senator Jones' resolution recited
that Inasmuch as the' honor of the
nation Is not In the custody ot one
man, but In the custody of the
people, It is the president's iluty to
present to congress details of com
plications that might lead to war be
fore taking an Irretrievable position.
Senator Stone disposed of dis6as-
sfon of either the Jones or the" Gore
measures by insisting upon tabling
them for a day. .
Tension marked the senate pro
ceedings, and Stone twice refused to
allow unanimous consent to discus
sion of bridge bills, fearing that the
talk might veer to the international
situation. . , , .

Washington, Feb. 25. Arguments
of bouse conferees on the German
situation falW to swerve' President -Wilson
today front bis stand that the
German armed merchantman decree
trangreesea International law and
that Americans ought not to be warn
ed from such vessels. ' -
After" nearly an hour's session with' 1
Speaker Clark, Majority Leader
KltChln and Chairman . Flood of the
bouse foreign committee, there was
still a disagreement between the pre
sident and congress as to the decree.
The upshot of the session, however.
was no action was 16 be taken by
congress today, at least.
President Wilson emphatically told
the conferees that 'he would not
budge from his plan of insisting that
Germany recognize every American
right. v :' ''
JusC as-'positively; Speaker Champ
Clark t ep&tSd that the house is over
whelming in favor of Issuing a warn-,
W ' - ..-
: Following the conferees confer
ence an epochal session of the cabinet 1
was" scheduled to consider the Ger
man problem.
Senator Stone's letter announcing
his view that a warning should be
Issued to Americans not to travel on
armed belligerent merchant vessels
elicited another letter from the pre
sident last night. In which he adhered
to the decision that while, he would
try to maintain peace, he would do so
only If the honor of America was up
held. . ' '
Stone announced,' however, In his
letter that be would try to prevent
an outbreak in the senate on the
subject of issuing a warning. .
The Stone letter followed a report
ed disagreement between him and
President Wilson in their Monday
night conference. Stone said he bad
revealed' the president's position in
so far as he could without violating
confidence.' This position showed the
president to be firmly tor insistence
upon the rights of Americans to
travel 6n armed! ships.
For the present the house will take
no action, the conferees said. It is
not believed that members, will evolve
their decision before next week. In
the interval Germany's reply to the
American position will undoubtedly
be at hand, so that the president will
have an opportunity to determine his
further action, which undoubtedly
will have a bearing on the position
congress taKes.
In leaving the conference,' Speaker
Clark, 'besieged by newspapermen,
said: '.. '
: "I told the president what the sen
timent of the house Is. Senator
Stone's letter and the president's
reply are the last word oh both sides
ot the question. When the. house
members read these letters they will
determine what the situation Is." .
.. While the conferees admitted that
neither side had succeeded In chang
ing the convictions of the other, they
said they bad promised the president
their utmost support in preventing
summary action on the part ot the
house. '
Upon reaching his office at the
capltot, Speaker Clark elaborated his
previous statement, saying:
"There Is a rumor that Germans
will postpone operation of their de
cree to the middle of March or the
first of April. I am Just guessing at
this, but if it Is true, It will give more
time for consideration. It they post
