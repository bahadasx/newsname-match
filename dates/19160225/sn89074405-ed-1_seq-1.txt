ASSOCIATION TO
DID MEETING IN
arc TONIGHT
Federalization of the Guard
is Favored by State
Militiamen.
GIVE SUPPORT TO
FLAG MOVEMENT
Greater Respect for National
Air and the Stars and
Stripes.
The lecture to be given in the
auditorium this evening at
8
o'clock by E. J. D. Larson, re
turned war correspondent, under
the auspices of the Machine Gun
company, is open to the public,
notwithstanding reports to the
contrary.
A general discussion of the respect
that should be paid the flag and na
tional air of the United States, and
methods of obtaining recruits for the
national guard, were the principal
subjects taken up at the meeting this
morning of the North Dakota national
guard association, in connection with
their annual convention being held in
Grand Forks.
The meeting in the assembly room
of the city hall this morning was op
ened by the invocation of Chaplain C.
D. Locklin, Sr., followed, by a general
discussion of methods of bringing
members of the various companies out
to the regular..drill* Jt$d of recruiting
new man."
In speaking of. the subject. Cape.
Sprague, Co. of Grafton, told of
various ways in which, he. was cam
palgnlng for new members and"-for
bringing. his men ,out to -the Weekly
drills.
Publicity Essential.
One method, he said, was to give
the company as much publicity as
possible through the local papers, and
in this way, create an interest in the
work of the organisation and keep it
continually before the eyes of the pub
lic.
Each drill night, said the speaker, a
short letter was sent to each member
of his company reminding him of the
fact that it was drill night, and re
questing him to be present.
Visitors to the armory during drill
lug hours who are eligible to enlist
ment, are given a gun and asked to
try various drills, and are sometimes
given uniforms to flt. In this way, an
interest in the work of the gu^rd is
created in the mind of the man, and,
in almost every case, he is eager to
enlist.
One of the hardest things to over
come, however. In obtaining new en
listments In the. naitonal guard, is the
objections offered by parent or em
ployer.
To overcome this, Capt. Sprague
has prepared a series of circulars to
send to the prospect for enlistment,
the father, or employer, as the case
may be.
In these weekly circulars, sent all
over the city of Grafton, the work of
the gnaril is explained, and various
subjects relative to the legislation
which is going on at Washington at
the present time are taken up.
In one circular to the fathers of the
city Capt. Sprague says:
"Have you fathers done your duty
to your country and your boy, or
didn't you raise your boy to be a sol
dier? Do you want some other fath
er's boy to do your fighting for you,
and protect your country's flag and
honor?"
The captain of this company is also
preparing a .large number of small
buttons to be worn on the lapel of the
coat when not In uniform, bearing the
Insignia "C." In this way the mem
bers of the guard in private life will
be kept forolbly before the public eye.
A general discussion of the subject
followed the address of Captain
Sprague:
The Resolutions.
The resolution committee, composed
of Capt. Ritchie, Major Hanley, Sergt.
Hurst, Lieut. Oftedahl and Capt Wha
len, submitted the resolutions drafted
for the acceptance of the members of
the association.

Germans Employ Great
Many Men on Front
Paris, Feb. 26.—The Temps in its
military review estimates that the
Germans are employing on the aver
age ten Infantrymen to every three
feet of front where the attack is
fiercest north of Verdun—that is over
a line eight miles in length between
Brabant and Ornes.
The reviewer maintains that the
operations are not necessarily pre
liminary to an attempt to besiege
Verdun, but comprise an attack on a
wide part of the front of which Ver
dun forms a part of the rear support.
The attacks, he declares, are still held
within the first line works while there
are three other lines of stragetic in
tervals behind the first. These lines
are more solidly-constructed and are
more elaborate in their nature than
the first lines as work on them could
be done at leisure, without the work
ers being within the range of the
German fire.

PRIMARY ACT
Boston, Feb. 25.—The house agreed
cV.. senate yesterday in passing
a bill rpodlf ylng the presidential pri
mary act qo that the names of can
didates for the party: nominations for
president may not appear on the bal
lot for convention delegates unless
the consent of such candidates is ob
uflned in writing.

the claim that it. tended to prevent a

ticularly those desirliig to vote for re
publican convention delegates pledged
to Theodore Roosevelt, might have
no opportunity of doing so In view of
the "written consent" clause.

$1.15 1-2 for July. These were 1-8 to
13-4 cents higher than yesterday's
finish.
The reason for the upturn seemed
to be the reaction from the semi-pan
icky selling of yesterday, and op-,
timism on the part of the majority of
dealers that some practical way out
of the difficulty with Germany would
be found.

Congress.
FAVOR WILSON.
Washington, Feb. 35.—The
fight in congress over warning
Americans off armed ships mark
ed time, with the parliamentary
situation, and other developments
favoring the president's position.
The cabinet discussed the situa
tion thoroughly, standing firmly
with the president.
Washington, Feb. 25.—President
Wilson reiterated his opposition to any
action in congress warning Americana
off armed ships, in a conference with
Speaker Clark, majority leader Kltch
ln and Chairman Flood, of the house
foreign affairs committee. They in
turn told the president that if such
resolution- was brought to a vote in
the house at this time, it would be
passed by a majority of two to one.
The president is unshaken in his po
sition that congress should take no
action embarrassing his contention
that the rights of Americans on seas
must be upheld at any cost.
House leaders finally told the presi
dent nothing would be done today, btit
ventured no predictions for the fu
ture. They admitted the situation is
serious.
After the conference Speaker Clark
told of the rumor that Germany will
postpone Its new submarine campaign
until April 1.
"The sum and substance of the
conference," Clark said, "is fully set
out In Senator Stone's letter to the
president, and the president's letter to
Senator Stone. We explained to the
president how the house felt. In our
judgment. I told the president this
warning resolution would carry two to
one if they ever got a chance for a
vote. Some enthusiastic gentlemen, I
said, thought it would carry three to
one.
"Of course, there was a great deal
of talk about international law re
garding the rights of Americans on
the seas, and precedents. At the con
clusion of the conference, it was very
clear to all that the president stands
on his letter to Senator Stone."
Senator Lodge is With
President in Stand.

Lodge, ranking republican member of
the foreign relations committee, de
clared in a statement that he is in

chances are Germany will postpone
this threatened performance until
April 1, or at least until the middle
of March," said Speaker Clark, after
his conference with President Wilson.
"There is a rumor to this effect and
a postponement would give us more
time."
Clark told the president that if a
resolution of warning, such as the
president opposes, were forced to vote
in the house now, it would pass by a
majority of two to one.
No Ultimatum Unless
Congress is Consulted
