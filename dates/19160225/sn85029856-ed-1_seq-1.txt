To Keep Soil From Blowing
Don't take a chance on losing your
wheat crop by allowing the soli to
blow. Take preventive steps.
This Is the advice given to the
western Kansas farmer by C. C. Cun
ningham,' assistant in co-operative
crop experiments in the Kansas State
Agricultural College. v
"Drifting soil often destroys large
acreages of wheat in western Kan
sas," says Mr. Cunningham. "The
extent of the loss varies with the
season, depending on the force of
the winds, the growth of the wheat,
and .the condition of the soil. In
1914, because of abnormal seasonal
conditions, little if any blowing oc
curred. "The most effective and also the
most practical method to control
blowing when it is about to start or
has begun is to list one or two fur
rows at Intervals of three or four
rods. The listing should be done
east and west, as most of the winds
that start the blowing of the soil are
from the north or the southwest.
Land can be got over very rapidly
In this way. The lister furrows may
be leveled with a disk lister culti
vator after the wheat has made suf
ficient growth to protect the soil.
"The proper use of the sub-surface
packer will considerably de
crease the chances of blowing. The
packer should be heavily weighted
and the field gone over in an east
and west direction. The packer
wheels leave the. soil In a ridged and
furrowed condition, which under or
dinary conditions prevents the soil
particles from obtaining a start in
that they do not move more than
four or five inches without falling in
to a packer .wheel furrow. Strong
winds long continued may finally
cause the furrows to become filled
and blowing may take place regard
less of the effort to control' it. A
disk set straight and weighted can
sometimes be used to advantage, but
It may damage some wheat and is
not a satisfactory implement. Where
the ground is loose, the use of the
packer may be beneficial in firming
soil.
"The harrow is sometimes used to
stop blowing, but the use of the im
plement is always more or less dan
gerous. When the ground is lightly
crusted and blowing is beginning,
the barrow may be used to advant
age, especially if the lower portion
of the crust is moist and consider
able west soil is mixed with the dry
surface soil.
"Soil drifting can easily be pre
vented by spreading straw thinly
over the fields. This requires time
and is not suitable when quick work
is necessary."

A Few Catalogs
The Liberal post office received
twenty-seven" sacks of Montgomery
ward catalogues on No. 1 Friday.
Each, sack weighed 160 pounds
which brought the total weight to
over two tons. The cost of mailing
each book was 19 cents. It evidently
pays this firm to advertise, or they
woulrin t give these big books away
and pay 19 cents to get one to you.
May Run a Stock Train
The Rock Island has been figuring
recently on putting on a tri-weekly
stock train, to start from Dalhart
and go to Kansas City. There is
considerable grief over the present
system of handling the livestock
business with other lines of freight
and it is thought a special train for
this purpose, which . would have
precedence over other freights,
would "fill a long-felt want." The
stock business of the Southwest Is
again assuming its old-time propor
tions and the putting on of a special
train to take care of it would relieve
the congestion due to handling so
many lines of freight by the same
train.

Clean-Up and Fire
Prevention Day
A clean-up week In the spring and
and a tire prevention day In the fall
is the plan of Lew T. Hussey, state
nnrshal, for reducing the lire loss this
year. Announcement for the days for
each will be made in the near future.
Last year the clean-up and tire pre-,
vent Ion day came both In the spring.'
"Ttie national movement for fire
prevention is becoming so strong that
a national tire prevention day will be
held In the fall in nearly every state
In the Union," said Fire Marshal
Hussey in announcing the change in
the scheme of things. "In that way,
too, there will be a real clean up In
the fall that will prevent the out
break of lires due to defective flues
and accumulated rubbish every winter.-
"The annual clean up wt:ek In the
spring will be pushed harder than
ever. It is one of the test move
ments from the tire prevention stand
point, ever started. The governor
will Issue a proclamation, calling on
all loyal citizens to get out and clean
up their yards, especially their back
yads.
"Then the Hoy Scouts, and civic or
ganizations and women's clubs, will
assist In seeing that all the towns
and cities are cleaned up. The clean
up week will come sometime In April.
This department also Is planning for
a big tire prevention and lire fighting
exposition in Topexa, probably a few
days ahead of the annual spring clean
up.
"Makers of different fire lighting
apparatus for use in the homes by In
dividuals will be Invited to demon
strate. We want every lire chief In
the state, If possible, to come in for
tills demonstration. The testa will
be real The agents will not be al
lowed to frame up their own tests,
but we will tlx the test, and allow
them to demonstrate. Safety ap
pliances, especially those used In
connection with gasoline in the home,
also will be demonstrated. "' ' "
More About Speeding
Chief of Police McMurry requests
the Democrat to announce that the
automobile race is how a matter of
history, and the signs about town
proclaiming twelve miles an hour as
the speed limit are meant to coiivey
that idea to the heads of the
thoughtless ones who still Imagine
the race is going on and try to main
tain the high spued record of that
race. Someone is liable to land In
the holdover If that fast driving in
town is continued, and have a chance
the next day to contribute a few
Bheckels to the town treasury In the
way of a line.
