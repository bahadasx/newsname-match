FOR ALFORD
Youthful Slayer of Oliver Smith Con
victed of Manslaughter After
Hard Fought Legal Battle
Estrage Alford was convicted of
the voluntary manslaughter of Oliver
Smith near McKinney on June 20,
1915, by a jury in Circuit court here
Triday morning. His sentence was
fixed at confinement in the state pen
itentiary for a period of not less than
15 nor more than 21 years. The jury
nor more than 21 years. The jury
-which tried the case was composed of
Messrs. H. D. Aldridge, C. B. McGuf
fey, OUie Murphy, M. F. Herrin, W.
G. Withers, H. C. Anderson, G. F.
Crawford, George Wood. Josh Wil
son, John Pepples, Mack Lawson and
J. S. Campbell.
The case was hard fought in cir
cuit court for two days, and the jury
deliberated from 10 o'clock Thursday
might when it was put in their hands
until just before noon Friday.
Alford was represented by Attor
neys George D. Florence and J. S.
"Owsley, while Commonwealth's At
torney Emmet Puryear and County
Attorney W. S. Burch, prosecuted.
Mrs. Oliver Smith, a daughter of
J. J. Durham, of McKinney was the
first witness put on the stand by the
prosecution. Alford's aged latter
and mother, Mr. and Mrs. J. J. Al
ford, were at his side constantly dur
ing the trial.
Wife of Murdered Man.
Mrs. Ella Smith, widow of the
murdered man, was the first witness
put on the stand by the Common
wealth. Mrs. Smith was dressed in
"black and gave her testimony, which
-was very damaging to Alford, in a
clear and even voice which carried
conviction with it. She said that
Smith was 35 years of age at the
time of his death; had been a farmer
most of his life; and that they had
six children. She was with him at
the time he was killed. In response
-to questioning by Mr. Puryear, Mrs.
Smith detailed the events leading up
to the death of her husband. She
said that about dusk on the day he
was killed, she was at the home of
Mrs. Kitrell, who lives on the pike
south of McKinney. Her husband
came up in front of the house ac--companied
by Ethrage Alford. She
asked Mrs. Kittrell to call her hus
band in, and he came in and then he
asked Mrs. Kidwell to call Alford in.
He refused to cone in and Smith
then asked Mrs. Kittrell to tell Al
ford to send the Lottie of whisky
in. Alford, replied to Mrs. Kittrell,
she" testified that he had said he
never intended to darken her door
again, and he meant it. She said
that her husband then went out and
got the whisky and put the bottle
in his pocket. She could see him and
Alford talking but couldn't tell what
they were saying. Tfley did not ap
pear angry. She said Alford then
went off in a cart with Claude
Hughes and Gaines Baugh. She did
not know whether the other two men
-were there with Alford before that
or not After Alford had gone, she
said, that she and her husband with
their baby, about a year old started
home, she carrying the child, and
Mr. Smith having his coat off and
over one arm. They started up the
lane to their home about a half mile
from the pike. When they were
about 100 yards up the lane, they
heard Alford come running after
them. No one was with him. He
"had a gun in his hand. She said that
Alford said:
"Wait there, Oliver, I want that
whisky." She said that her husband
stopped, turned around and said to
Alford:
"What do you mean coming up
here with that gun?"
Alford replied: "I want that whis
ky; every drop of it."
Mrs. Smith said her husband then
told Alford, "I will give you half of
it but not all of it. I haven't nary a
drink for in the morning."
To this Alford replied that he was
going to have "all of it."
Mrs. Smith then said that each
man asked the other if he had not al
ways treated him right in every way,
and both agreed that they had. Al
ford then insisted upon getting all
of the whisky while Smith would
agree to give him only half. Mrs.
Smith said she walked on 10 steps
while they were talking, and that
her husband then turned to follow.
He turned his back to Alford, and
as he did so. Alford shot him. The
load entered behind the right car
and killed Smith instantly. She said
that Alford then turned away and
went toward the pike. She put her
baby down and ran to her husband.
She said that her husband had a pis
tol in his coat pocket, but that it
was not loaded as she herself had
taken out the loads the night before.
She said her husband had left it in a
bureau drawer and she was afraid
the children would get hold of it.
Upon cross examination by Mr.
Florence, Mrs. Smith said that she
was not aware that her husband had
any particular purpose in putting the
pistol in his coat pocket when he
went out. She said he knew the
loads were not in it. The court sus
tained objection of the common
wealth to Mr. Florence's question as
to whether she had had any trouble
with her husband and had drawn the
from using it against her. She said
however, that she didn't take out the
loads because she was afraid he
would use it on her. She admitted
:that her husband might have been
drinking some but .that he was not
drunk the evening before. She said
he had taken only one drink that
day, and that in Mrs. Kittrell's
house.
Henry Alford. a- cousin of the ar
oused, was placed on the stand by
ii , .- .-. . .- -... j .
Estrage Alford' had come
tne prosecution, and admitted that'
to his
house the Sunday afternoon of the
murder, and tried to borrow a gun,
but said that he had refused to let
him have it, and that Estrage then
said he would go home and get his
own gun. He said that he and Gaines
Baugh were the first ones to the
body of Oliver Smith after he was
killed and that they turned the body
over and Smith had a pistol in his
right hand. He took it out of
Smith's hand and took it home.
Mrs. Alice Helm, who lives near
Mrs. Kittrell, testified that Estrage
Alford came to her home about half
an hour before Eire killing, and pick
ed up a shotgun and saw it was not
loaded and pitched it back; then
went out saying he would get his
own gun and that he was going "to
kill that s o b." She said it was
not very long afterward till the kill
ing took place.
Estelle Walls, who lives on Mc
Kinney Creek, near the scene, heard
Baugh, Hughes arid Alford talking
on the road outside her home, and
heard a voice which she believed was
that of Alford say he was going to
"kill that s o b if I can find him."
Claude Hughes, one of the young
men with Alford in the cart just
before the killing, said that they
had started from Mis. Kittrell's
home to Oliver Smith's when the
horse got down, "in a mud hole and
Alford got out and went on on foot.
He said that he asked Alford to help
them get the horse up but that Al
ford said he was going on "To. kill
that s o b ." He said that while
they were in the cart Alford shot
the gun once to see if it was loaded.
He said that he and Baugh were
about 75 yards away from the scene
of the killing. On cross examina
tion, when asked if he was intoxica
ted, he said he had had several
drinks. He denied that he said to
Alford that if he was Alford he
would kill Smith if he did notrgive up
the whisky. He said that there had
been no threat of prosecution made
him to testify as he did.
Gaines Baugh, who was also in
the cart with Alford, denied some of
the statements made by Hughes. He
said that they had taken Alford in
the cart with them when he came up
with his gon and suggested that they
go to Oliver Smith & and get some
whisky. He said that Alford fired
off the gun once but didn't say why
he did it nor did he say anything
about Smith. He said Alford said
that he had some whisky at Smith's.
Baugh admitted that he had three or
four drinks, but was not much under
its influence. He said they stopped
at Mrs. Kidwell's and asked for
Smith and when the horse got in a
mu dhole Alford got out and walked
fast up the hollow, without saying
a word. Jtie said in hve or six nun
utes- he heard a shot and then Tieard
Mrs. Smith crying, and? when Alford
came he asked him what he had done,
and Alford told him to go up there
and see. He said that Smith was ly
ing on the ground with his head
pointed up the road toward his home.
He said that Henry Alford, a cousin
of the man who did the killing, was
with him and that they were the first
ones to the body. They turned Smith
over and a quart bottle half full of
whisky dropped out of a coat pocket.
He said there was a pistol lying by
the side of the body, but he couldn't
tell whether Smith had hold of it or
not. Henry Alford picked it up. The
coat was hanging over the arm and
the pistol was under the arm. He
said' that Henry Alford called to him
to "see that pistol." He said that
before that Alford had made no
statement about killing Smith, neith
er by threats or mentioning his
name. When Alford fired the gun
in the cart, he heard him say that
fired it "to see if the damn thing
would work." He denied that he had
told Alford to go and get Oliver to
hejp them get the horse up. Baugh
said that Hughes was drunk at the
time; that he had seen him take three
or four drinks.
John Skidmore, who conducted a
store near the scene of the killing, at
that time, said that he stepped the
distance from the pike to where the
body was and that it was about 136
yards. He said that the body was
to one side of the road, but blood
trom the wound was in the center
of the road.
Stroud Gooch. who help prepare
the remains, said that the wound in
Smith's head was about an inch and
a half behind the right ear, in the
nair. He said a few shot had struck
trie ear from behind, and some
seemed to have gone clear through
the head, and were noticeable un
der the skin near the right eye.
This ended the testimony of the
Commonwealth and Alford, the ac
cused, was put on the stand by the
defense.
Alford's Story of the Killing.
Estrage Alford, said that he is the
son of J. A. Alford, and was born at
his father's home on Green River. 23
years ago. He railroaded for five
years but at the time of th nn;
had not been working on account of
the crew being laid off, and had been
helping his father on his farm. Al
ford said he had trouble with Oli
ver Smith before the killing. Then
under the questioning of Mr. Flor
ence, he detailed his actions on the
Sunday when he killed Smith. He
said that he first met Smith about
11 O ClOCk that mnrnino- af TTnnw Al
ford's and was with him there until
about 4:30 o'clock. He and Oliver
and Zora Smith got in a buggy, took
a ride, and then stopped at his home
for some whisky. After that they
went to Mrs. Kitrell's, where they
got out and went in to. give the wo-;
men a drink. A negro man, a ne
gro woman, -Mrs. Kittrell, Mrs.
Brawner and Oliver Smith were in
there. Mrs. Smith was not present.
They remained there about an hour
and a half. He had no trouble with
Oliver Smith nor any misunderstand

Aitord said
1 h.e went home after some more whis
ky while Smith waited for him at
Floyd's. When he came back they
met his aunt, Nannie Alford and
gave her a drink, he said. They went
in Mrs. Kitrell's to take another
drink with Will Peck, to keep any
one from seeing them, he testified;
then went to Henry Alford's and af
terward to Mrs. Kittrell's again. Al
ford said he met Lillie Pearl Douglas
whom he was going with, and stayed
with her for about an hour and a
half. She asked him if he wanted to
go to "Ella's" meaning Mrs. Oliver
Smith's and they went there. Alford
said Oliver was there then, asleep
on the floor with a pillow under his
head. After Alford said he went
home to eat supper and that Smith
went with him but wouldn't eat any
thing. Afterward he said he started to
iSam Douglas' to call on Miss Doug
las, with whom he had an engage
ment for 7:30 o'clock. He and Ol
iver Smith met Will Lyons, who ask
ed Smith for a drink, and Alford der.
clared that Smith told the negro that
"yellow faced s o b carries my
whisky." Then he and Smith went
on, he testified and near Jim Single
ton's Smith stopped him he said and
told him "If I thought you would
ever tell where we've been or what
we have done, I'd kill you," and he
pulled his pistol. AJfcrd so'd he
asked Smith if he had not always
been his friend, and then Smith put
the gun back. As they went by Mrs.
Kittrell's she called Smith in and Al
ford said he'd wait. Smith stayed in
there about 30 minutes, he said, and
Hughes and Baugh came up in a
cart. The whisky bottle was in the
house, Mrs. Kittrell having carried it
in. They wanted a drink Alford
said, and "I called to Oliver to send
the whisky out or come on." Al
ford said he sent in the 8-year-old
Brawner boy several times after the
whisky, and Smith sent him word
that he couldn't get the whisky. Al
ford continued: "Oliver then came
out and told the other boys to move
on and said to me 'I got to have a
little talk with you'; and then asked
me: 'Is it whisky or trouble you are
looking for?' I told him if I had
to have trouble to get my whisky,
you can keep it. Lyons asked him
for a cigarette and Oliver pulled his
pistol and said: 'That's the kind of
smoke I carry.' After Lyons had
gotten a cigarette, he "asked for a
match, and Oliver pulled his pistol
again and said to hold the cigarette
up and he'd light it off the end of
the pistol."
Alford then said that he went to
Mrs. Helm's to get a gun and after
ward to Henry Alford's, testifying
that he wanted it to "protect" him
self.. He said that he made no
i threats at-rs.Hlm'-s JraJ'cilL
uiie. .rtLixeL-wH.ru ne went. 'lo.Mnenry
Aliord s and then home and got his
gun
He said that he had been run
over up and down this road until he
was tired of it. He put six loads in
his gun. It was a Winchester pump
gun. Then he met Baugh and Hughes
in their cart .and got in with them.
Alford said he did not fire the gun
to see if it was loaded; but that
Hughes fired it. He told them he
was going to Sam Douglas' and they
said he could ride with them that
far. He said Hughes asked him for
some whisky tand he told him he had
given it to 'Oliver Smith and then
Hughes said they would go there af
ter some. Alford told him he was
not going about Smith or going to
say anything to him as he wanted no
trouble. Alford continued: "At Mrs.
Kittrell's Baugh asked me to see if
Oliver was in 'there and I told him
I would but. would not say anything
else to him, so I got out, and set
my gun down by the fence. Mrs.
Kittrell said that Oliver had gone
home. I said to them 'That settles
it; you get no whisky.' They said
they would go to Oliver's and get it
ana let me ride toSam Douglas.'
Describes the Killing.
"They were driving-a young horse
and the cart got in a mud hole, axle
deep, so I got out and started to walk
to Douglas' which was about 500
yards away. Within 60 yards I met
Oliver. I was walking at a common
walk. His wife was with him and
when she saw me she said: 'Lord God
Oliver, there comes Ethrage with a
gun.' Oliver then asked me 'What
are you packing that gun for me
for?' I told him that I was not
packing it for him; only to protect
myself. I then put the gun down,
resting it against two saplings. He
came up close to me and began to
pat me on the chest, and asked if
we weren't good friends. I told him
that up to that night we had always
been, but that he hadn't treated me
right about that whisky "and he
knew it. He asked me if I wanted
a drink and I told him no, but that
I wanted my whisky for the morning;
and that he could give me half. He
asked what he could do with it, and.
how we could divide it as we had
nothing to nut it in. Then he said
no, I would not get any; that he was
going to drink it all. And then he
drew his pistol and threw it down
on me, and said 'If you want to set
tle any trouble, settle it how.' I
leaned back and got my gun, and as
I drew it up pulled the trigger. I
shot him to save my own life. He

traction as a "Home Coming Week"
to the many visitors.
afraid of him. This concluded the
examination by the defense, and Al
ford was turned over to the prosecu
tion for cross-examination, which
was conducted by Mr. Puryear.
In response tojniestions from the
Commonwealth's Attorney, Alford
denied that he had gone home to get
his gun to kill bmith, but simply to
protect himself. He admitted that
when he was at home at supper he
didn't think he needed a gun to pro
tect himself. He said he had no idea
of trouble with Smith when he got
the gun; that he had told Smith he
could keep the whisky. He denied
that" he' had said he did not ore
about the horse being in the mud;
and that he was going to kill Smith.
Mr. Puryear read to Alford extracts
from a stenographic report of his
testimony at his examining trial, and
asked him for an explanation of the
difference between his testimonv
ftjjy-i.ShVUn" variouspoints andfe?tir
morion-the present trial. iflierr;ead-
iug,ui ne examining inai xesumony
seemed to make a great impression
upon every one, for Alford's testimo
ny was radically contradictory on
different important points. Mr. Pur
year showed that at the examining
trial Alford had testified that he
went to the home of Mrs. Helm for a
gun after he had shot Smith, while
on the stand at the present trial he
swore that he went there before he
shot Smith. The prosecutor also
brought out that at the examining
trial Alford said Mrs. Smith was
standing in a drain by some bushes,
where as as this trial he said that
Mrs. Smith was out of his sight. In
reply to questionings, he said that it
was so dark he coula only see Smith's
bulky figure. At the- examining trial
he testified that Smith was looking
at his wife when he shot him. He
said that Smith turned his head just
as he fired the fatal .shot, he sup
posed "To keep from seeing him hit
me." . - -
Alford contradicted his former
testimony considerably, and made a
very bad witness for his own cause.
Miss Lillie Pearl Doudas. sweet
heart of the accused youth, was next
put on the stand and. testified that
she had an enerairement with Alford
for that evening and was expecting
him at 7:30 o'clock. The only ques
tion asked her by the prosecution was
Mr. Puryear's query whether Alford
was in the habit of calling upon her
with a shotgun, to which she replied
in the negative.
Will Lyons, the negro mentioned
as being at Mrs. Kittrell's, told of
the incident there when Smith is al
leged to have offered to light his
cigarette with his pistol, etc. He told
substantially the same story on this
point as Alford. He said that. Smith
was known to generally go armed,
but never heard of him shooting or
cutting anyone.
Henry Alford said that Smith's
reputation was pretty bad at times
and at other times was all right.
John L. Beck, R. S. Scudder and
W. S. Embry were introduced as
character witnesses by the defense,
but gave that side little testimony
of value.
The defense introduced Mrs. Kit
trell and Elbert Brawner, an eight-year-old
boy, who told of incidents
at her house, and Brawner told of
going to the body of Smith and see
ing the pistol in his hand.

Q. & C. DIVISION TO BOWEN?
Persistent Rumor That Railroad Will
Move Big Plant.
A" persistent rumor is rife in the
West End of Lincoln that the divi
sion is to be moved from Danville to
a point in the West End of Lincoln
probably at Bowen Station. It is
known that Q. & C, representatives
have been taking options on a large
tract of land in that section, and it
is reported that as soon as a sufficient
acreage has been obtained, removal
of the trackage and equipment from
the Danville yards will begin. Bowen
lies about three miles south of Junc
tion City, and it is said to be the plan
to have the tracks and yards extend
practically from one station to the
other. Inability to obtain more
ground at Danville save at the most
exorbitant prices is said to be respon
sible for the reported plan of the
railroad company. Furthermore the
facilities for obtaining an adequate
supply of water at Danville are said
to be such that the railroad is desir
ous of removing the yards and it is
said that the engineers have discov
ered that economy can be secured
in a diversity of ways, to make the
change a very desirable one. Lin
colnites residing in thai section of
the county, are said to be offering
every inducement possible to secure
the division point for the new lo
cality, realizing the tremendous- ad
vantages it will give them, both in
enhancement of their property val
ues and in the bringing of new trade
and business to that community. It
has been suggested that Stanford's
live wire Chamber of Commerce
should make an investigation of the
rumored removal and do what it can
to bring this big "business enter
prise" to the West End of this coun
ty. TWO JURIES WERE "HUNG"
On Minor Cases Before Court Took
Up Smith Murder Trial.
Circuit court has been engrossed
principally this week with considera
tion of the Alford-Smith murder
case, but before it was taken up sev
eral minor cases were disposed of. A
jury acquitted Chas. Robbins, of the
East End, on a charge of drawing a
pistol on H. B. Howard. The jury
which tried Will Love, a local negro,
on a charge of sellmg whisky to Sam
Taylor, was unable to agree. The
trial of A. B. Florence, on a charge
of intimidating election officers, also
resulted in a hung jury. The case
against Milton Powell for assault
and battery, growing out of thesame
incident, was cpmpromiseu witn a

lipps, "was fined $60 arid costs. Lus
ter was shooting at Phillips' father
at the time. The grand jury has been
very busy this week investigating va
rious offenses, and a number of in
dictments have been returned. One
or two indictments are rumored to
have been returned growing out of
incidents in connection with the Alford-Smith
killing.
Dan Milburn, of Lancaster, who
formerly sold sewing machines in
this county, was acquitted by a jury
Friday morning of having shot Jim
Jones, a negro of the Hale's Well
section.
BIG LOT SALE WEDNESDAY.
One of the finest building sections
adjacent to Stanford will be opened
up for homes by Walton Bros., the
Town Lot Men of Glasgow, in a big
sale here next Wednesday afternoon.
A big advertisement will be found
on. the third page today, giving de
tails of the sale of the most desirable
building section, which probably can
be found anywhere near this city.
It is the Embry subdivision of 30
acres on Lancaster avenue. The
Messrs. Walton are on the ground,
and are advertising their big sale far
and wide. They are experienced reel
estate men and are well known here
having conducted the sale of the lots
in what is known as the Land
subdivision several years ago. They
oougnt tnat property at that time
from the Embry Bros., and pleased
"everyone with their methods of sell
ing. They will have a brass band
and other attractions and plan to
make next Wednesday afternoon a,
red letter day for all.

REPUBLICANS
TO MEET HERE
County Convention. Will Be Held
Saturday and District Convention
On Tuesday Next.
The Lincoln county republican
convention will be held here Satur
day afternoon at which time 18 del
egates will be chosen to the Eighth
district convention which meets in
Stanford next Tuesday, Feb. 29th.
On the following day, March 1st,
the republicans of the state will meet
in convention at Louisville and
choose their delegates to the national
convention to be held in Chicago,
and which will nominate their candi
date for president.
A few weeks ago it seemed that
former Vice President Fairbanks of
Indiana, would get the instructions,
of the Kentucky delegation to the
national convention. Edwin P. Mor
row, recent republican candidate for
governor, had promised that he
should have Kentucky, in return for
the many favors the tall, slim Hoos
ier statesman has done in the. past
for Kentucky republicans, but now
it"all seems changed. The rank and
file of the Kentucky republicans are
not for Fairbanks, and a great many
of the leaders who never did be
lieve that he had a chance to be nom
inated, want to "ride a live one."
For that reason, the majority of the
Kentucky delegation to the national
convention will, go uninstructed, and
be ready to ride the Hughes band
wagon when it gets started.
Former Internal Revenue Collector-
Ludlow F. Petty, of Shelbyville,
made a gumshoe visit up in this end
of the state the other day, and
"things" changed around considera
ble after this visit. Prominent re
publicans who had previously been
for Fairbanks instructions, came out
with the declaration that Kentucky
should go uninstructed. Petty is a
wheelhorse in the ranks of the repub
licans, and many believe he is work
ing right in line with former Post
master General Frank Hitchcock,
who is said to be strongly for
Hughes. The tip has gone out that "
Roosevelt will support Hughes if he
is nominated, and this, it is said, will
make the movement to nominate the
associate justice of the Supreme
court all the stronger. A great many,
however, see in thi3 subtle Hughes
movement a scheme to obtain enough
uninstructed delegations at the na
tional convention, to bring about the
nomination of Roosevelt at the pro
per time. It really looks mighty like
it will be either Hughes or Roosevelt.
J If it is not Roosevelt, it is a pretty!.

this honor when the district conven
tion meets here. Several hundred
prominent republicans from the 11

then take the train for Louisville,
for the state convention.
