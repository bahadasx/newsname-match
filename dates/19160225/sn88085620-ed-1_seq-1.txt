Reorganization Meeting
Largely Attended
Outlook For Shingleweavers' Union | never brighter for organization work.
*» Most Encouraging; Noted Brother Tom Kelly of Three Lakes
Speakers Heard reported all men organized but one,
and he wasn't wanted.
Several of the local boys also made
interesting addresses.
President E. P. Marsh of the State
Federation of Labor made an address
in his usual clear and vigorous style,
in tlie course of which he dwelt
strongly upon the necessity for con
structive work in the rebuilding of
the organization, pointing out some
of the weaknesses that marked the
path of the old organization. Refer
ring to the strikes, he said:
"There are times in the life of ev
ery organization when strikes are
necessary, when not to strike would
be both cowardly and suicidal. But
the chief aim of our existence as a
labor organization should he secur
ing of industrial justice without
strikes and this can only be brought
about through a strong union, free
from petty strife and discord, work
ing along practical lines and with a
definite policy in mind. When men
are striking over petty things they
are wastng their energies, dissipating
their union funds and eating up their
own scanty hoards. The strongest
labor organizations in this country
have fewest strikes."
He emphasized the necessity of
having defense funds to enforce their
demands and cited several instances
of other unions that had been able
to forestall strikes and lockouts be
cause of their strong treasuries, back
ed up by the determined spirit of the
membership.
The mass meeting hold at the La
bor Temple last Sunday afternoon was
•Attended by a large number of shingle
weavers who recognize the value of
organization. The spirit of the meet-
Mng was most encouraging, giving
kpromise of an early reorganization of
shingleweavers not only of Everett
and Snohomish county, but of the en
tire Northwest. Many of the boys

statement were not present, for ob
vious reasons. From the statements
of various men who took the floor, it
was very evident that the sentiment
in favor of reorganization was virtu
ally unanimous. Many took out cards
then and there 1 , and Tuesday's meet
ing of the Shingleweavers' Union, Lo
cal No. 2, looked good to those inside.
The meeting Sunday was called to
$rder by Charles Knecht, president
of the Everett union, who called upon
Brother Mills for a report of work
Bo far accomplished. The progress
and prospects as reported by Secre
tary Mills was distinctly encouraging.
* Brother W. H. Reid, International
Secretary, was then called upon for
a report of his work throughout the
State, and his address was both in
forming and heartening.
International President J. G. Brown
was present and gave a most inter
esting account of his recent organiz
ing tour. He stated that a conven
tion will be called within the next 60
days, probably in Seattle, when offi
cials of Hie reorganized shingleweav
ers will be elected and a new consti
tution adopted.
Brother Frank Nickerman of Sno
homish, reported practically 100 per
cent, of shingleweavers organized in
his district. A strong spirit of solid
arity prevailed, and the outlook was

Shingle Weavers Turn Out Rousing
. Meetings—Spirit of Revolt Against
Unjust Conditions Not Dead.
By E. P. Marsh
\ Last week President J. G. Brown,
of the Shingle Weavers, and myself
were in Raymond. We are glad we
went. We saw and heard enough to
convince us that the spirit of revolt
against unjust industrial conditions
is not dead.
Monday night we talked to the
Shingle Weavers' Union, a body near
ly" wiped off the map last year. Over
60 were in the hall, and they were
sure full of pep. They assured us
tljat within 60 days they would be
100 per cent, organized.
Those shingle weavers appointed a
committee of five to boost registra
tion in that locality, and admonished
the committee to get out and hustle.
All over the state, same thing. Com
ing back strong. Those boys tasted
the fruits of organization once and
they never forgot it.
The next night in the same city
Bro. Brown and myself talked to a
(lathering where standing room was
at- a premlutn — many stood up
throughout the meeting, which lasted
two hours upon the report of the
■federal Relations Commission. Over
half "ie audience was composed of
m.en and women not members ot
unions. Surely a spirit of industrial
awakening is abroad in the land.
This is the year of promise from an
oVgani/.ation standpoint, fellow union
ist, let us take advantage of it.
No Leader of labor contends that the union is a perfect in
* stitution.
tia one sees ils faults more clearly than does the sincere
labor leader.
Hut he knows that human institutions are never perfect.
Tlie ancients believed that tlie pyramids were so eon
, itnkfd that they east no shadow.
Hut few things in this world are wholly free from shadows.
, Tlie labor union has shadows.
Hut it towers gradually upward as the noblest of practical
human institutions.— Bridgemans Magazine.
Paying glowing tribute to the in
herent qualities of manhood of the
men comprising the rank and file of
shingleweavers, he predicted an or
ganization arising from the ashes of
the old that would be a credit to the
labor movement if the membership
would rebuild along careful, well
thought out lines of action.
IS $10 ENOUGH?
HOW TO GET MORE
WASHINGTON, Feb. 10.— J. P. Mor
,gan is chairman of the Finance Com
imittee of the Steel Corporation. In
vestigation at Youngstown showed
that the shamefully low wages and
jlong hours imposed on the steel work
ers there were defended on the ground
I that the steel corporation sets the
'standard Independent manufacturers
say they can pay no more than the
steel corporation.
Morgan's personal views are impor
tant because of his commanding posi
tion in the greatest of employing cor
porations. Testifying before the Com
! mission on Industrial Relations in
! New York a year ago, Morgan was
asked if he considered $10 a week a
.sufficient wage for a longshoreman.
"It Is if ?10 is all he can get, and
he takes it," replied Morgan.
That was honest, anyhow. Morgan
didn't pretend that his corporation is
a benevolent father to his 230,000 em
ployees, and that they can trust to its
generosity and conscience He frank
ly admits, in effect, that it hasn't any
conscience. If the steel workers can
get more, they are entitled to it. The
VouugstOwT) workers who struck and
formed unions gave a valuable object
lesson in how to go about it.

The Chicago Federation of Labor
Offers Program of National
Preparedness
Adopt Report of Executive Board at Meeting Sunday, Febru
ary 6—Will Ask Aid of Other Central Bodies in Securing
Endorsement by Governing Powers—Greatest Prepared
ness in Developing a Country That Workers Will Want
to Defend.
At the regular weekly meeting held
Sunday afternoon, February 6, 191G,
the Chicago Federation of Labor,
amidst tremendous enthusiasm, adopt
ed the following report of the execu
tive board of the federation, outlining
labor's position on the great question
of preparedness. The report is a his
torical document, and the principles
set forth will undoubtedly be adopted
as the stand of the labor movement:
If we are to express the attitude
of the labor movement toward the in
crease of military power, we must
lace the issue squarely and consider
all Questions concerned in relation to
the workers. We must draw the line
between "preparedness" as it might
be defined by labor, and the militar
ism which is the real desire of the
commercial interests.
The program advocated by "big
business" and the newspapers which
it controls should be unqualifiedly op
posed by organized labor. The kind
of preparedness in which we believe
would not result in the' destruction
but in the protection of human life
and the products of labor. Our pre
paredness would mean the develop
ment of every man, woman and child
to the highest possible standard. Fur
thermore, it would develop the only
true patriotism. A government which
would give equal opportunity and jus
tice to all would possess, in the high
est degree, the love and loyalty of
its citizens. The father who could
look forward with courage and forti
tude; the mother who could go about
her daily tasks in peace and confi
dence in the future; the children as
sured of opportunity—would love their
country and protect it. Such people
would have too high a sense of jus
tice to attack, wantonly, any other
people.
Throughout all the countries of the
world today there is a struggle for the
control of industrial organization.
Upon one side are the great commer
cial interests; upon the other side the
great organizations of labor. A study
of the political governments of our
day will prove that they are domin
ated by the powerful business organi
zations. Their problems are the prob-
IMMIGRATION BILL
PENDING IN HOUSE
WASHINGTON—The Burnett im
migration bill, which has been re
ported favorably by the house com
mittee on immigration, is now pend
ing in the house, and will be consid
ered within the next fortnight.
The passage of ths bill is not ques
tioned —the fight is to secure a two
thirds vote in the event that the presi
dent again vetoes the measure. Dur
ing the last congress the president's
veto was sustained by only four votes
and every effort is being made by
trade unionists and other friends of
American living standards to defeat
the purpose of cheap labor advocates
who, under normal conditions, have
made possible two men for every job
In the trustified industries
Trade unionists are urged to Im
press on their senators and congress
men the necessity for immigration
restriction.
A larger vote than formerly should
be secured, thus making possible a
two-thirds vote in the event of a veto
by the president.
Unionists should protest against
compelling workers possessing Amer
ican ideals to compete indefinitely
with the illiterate of southern and
eastern Europe.

Admiral Chadwick on Imperialism
In the Chicago Herald, December
LTt, 1315, William T.. Chenery quotes
Hear Admiral Chadwick, U. S, N\, as
follows:
"Imperialism has had its worst and
most injurious development in recent
years, its essence being land grabbing
and the establishing of spheres of
influence. Navies and armies are the
insurance for capital owned abroad by
the leisure class of a nation If is
for them that empires and spheres of
influence exist. The great war now
raging is a culmination of efforts to
maintain and extend these spheres.
The time has come to call a halt."
Any plan for heavy armament un
der present conditions would mean
the spending of billions, the building
up of great ammunition trusts and
other trusts which take their life
out of the labor of the workers. It
would mean the development of an
oligarchy of powerful commercial
forces which would dominate the gov
ernment and crush out forever the
hope of democracy. The stronger the
military power would become, the
stronger would become the power of
the commercial interests Not only!
would they dominate the social and
political life of the country, but they'
would control the educational policy,
teach theii philosophy in the schools,
subsidize the newspapers and all
sources of information. Their power
to do these things today is nothing
to what it would be if a creat army
and navy backed them tit)
But this is not the only danger.
Warfare is becoming more and more
a matter of mechanics and labor. En
gineers, chemists, mechanics, trench
diggers and laborers are fighting the

! power includes a plan for industrial
organisation. Furthermore, every
: plan looks toward some form of coer
cion, not only military conscription,)
but industrial conscription, which |
i would bring the workers of the na
, tion under military control.
I Conscription Ideal of Military Leaders
The ideal of military leaders is a
great organization of workers under
I control of the army, disciplined,
taught to respond and obey. These
' I men would be ready for war if war
', 1 were desired, and in times of peace
would be occupied upon great Indus
■ trial projects under the direct con
trol of the army of a paternalistic
government.
Tublic ownership of arms and mu
nition factories, of the mines, forests
|and natural resources which would
be necessary to the supply of raw
material, and of the railroads and
steamships necessary to do its trans
portation, would be the first step to
j take in any plan of preparedness
which labor could endorse. Now Is
j the time for labor to hold and
' : strengthen its power over the organi
-1 zation of Industry if the spirit of de
mocracy is to be saved.
As a program for the support of
' organized labor we recommend the
following:
1. Work for the passage of the
Keating child labor bill, which would
prohibit the interstate transportation
of the products of child labor
Endeavor to raise the age limit
in child labor and compulsory educa
tion laws to 16 years.
3. Support legislation abolishing
strikebreaking detective agencies and
private gunmen.
4. Work for the Buchanan home
loan bill.
Put Power of Nation Back of Home
5. Put the power of the nation
back of the home, pension mothers
and protect children.
6. Abolish the tenement system of
life and work to secure a clean,
healthful system of housing
7. Provide for outdoor physical
training in connection with the public
schools, to be continued during the

WORK AND PLAY NECESSARY
TIFFIN, Ohio.—"Every human be

work and a certain amount of play."
said Mrs Barr, in an address to
churchmen in this city. "No man can
labor all the time and be happy, nei
ther can he be at leisure all the time
and be happy. No nation, no com
munity, no class of people can keep
up without the higher standard of la
bor, and where labor is put on the
lower standard, the more misery, the
more suffering and criminality there
exists."

Registration Is Labors Firs! Duty
By E. P. Marsh *
To those of us in this city who do
not realize the prime necessity of
active work and effective organiza
tion to defeat the seven measures
passed by the last legislamre and re
ferred to the people via the referen
dum, I want to call attention to a
quotation from a speech made in Se
attle recently by George X. Skinner,
President of the State Employers' As
sociation. Mr. Skinner said:
"This law (referring to the antl
picketing law) is of incalculable im
portance to all employers and to th<
public generally in that it would put
lan end to one of the most vicious, tin-
I American practices known to indus
trial life. The other laws which you
are familiar with are of equal Im
portance, and should finally become
the laws of the state. Although the
; legislature passed these laws unani
j mously, a small organized minority
jof voters have been able to handcuff
and prevent them from becoming op
i erative and may be able, eventually,
to defeat them by a referendum vote.
| A strong unrelenting fight must be
I waged to retain these laws on the
statute books. That long battle must
be fought by this association. Money
j contributed for such a campaign can
not wiu the day alone. Every mem
ber of this organization must go to
the polls and vote. Enthusiasm and
co-operation on the part of every busi
ness man are absolutely necessary tc
accomplish the desired results."
It ought to be most plain that the
enemies of organized labor are awake
and ready to wage battle for bills
which mean everything to organized
labor.
What are we going to do about it?
Within a short time initiative pe
titions will be ready for signature pro
posing the following new laws: A
first aid amendment to the work
man's compensation law: a non-parti
san direct primary bill; a revised fish
code placing tax on fish caught, a
merely nominal license upon equip
ment and abolishing fish traps in
Puget Sound waters: a law granting
to cities and counties the power to
make and regulate rates governing
public utilities.
The first essential thing is the mat
ter of registration that the voters may
be eligible to sign the petitions when
they are placed in circulation. A
very' small percentage of union men
in this city have so far registered.
Don't delay any longer. Register
yourself and see to it that every mem
ber of your family of voting age reg
isters.
There has in the past been too much
petty bickering over non essentials in
our labor movement. Let's cut it out.
The battle that is on is too big to
be dwarfed by personal grudges and
animosities. Ijet's forget the little
differences and get ready for the real
ly big things that count, the things
that shape the destinies of our or
ganizations and have a close relation
to the well being of our citizenship

A PERILOUS SITUATION
ANTI-UNION THEORY REJECTED

E. Burnett made this comment in a
i recent sermon:
"The published statement of the
manager of the local traction com
pany to the effect that the fixed plan
of the company is to deal only with
the workers as individuals indicates
the reactionary viewpoint of the own

of sitting on the safety valve to save
an explosion. Such an attitude can
only foster unrest, and, taken the
country through, is the most perilous
factor in the whole industrial situa
tion.

bargaining."
