Receives $3601.87 for Beans
Conrad Ellis of the Potlatch ridge
came to the front last week as a
bean king of the Potlatch country.
Last year he raised one hundred
acres of beans and last Saturday
sold them to the local warehouse.
The check received was $3601.87,
and he has a few hundred pouuds
left. Another thing he has taken
that same ground and sown it to
fall wheat and has an excellent
stand. This is enough to prove to
the on looker that the ground in the
Potlatch country is of the best and
that the farmer can if he does the
right thing raise good crops every
year.
The Kendrick Harness Shop has

Inspector Here
a
The Pure Food Inspector, Mr.
Wilson was in this city last week
looking after the welfare of the
community and in some places he
found it necessary to make a little
cleaning. It is funny that some
people will insist upon letting dirt
and filth accumilate around their
premises year after year without
cleaning up. It is easy to keep
clean if you only think so and much
better than to have some one else
come around and tell you how dirty
you are. It is now time of the year
that every one should clean up the
yards and repair the old fences with
new ones and make cement walks
where those old board walks are and
then get a little paint and apply it
on the buildings and make this town
a pleasant place to live.
To enforce Minor Law
M. C. Johnson probation officer
of Nez Perce County was on the
Potlatch last week visiting the

ed the Southwick school and in the
evening he went to Leland where
he delivered an address before the
members of the Community social.
He remarked that he was well pleas
ed with the school work on that
ridge. His attention was called to
the use of tobacco by minors. The
matter was taken up and the law
will be enforced as to this violation.

News Notes and Timely Hints
Have you tested your seed corn
for germination?
Are you boosting the Boys and
Girls Club work in your community?
It will pay.
Plan to help the teacher and child
ren this spring to set some hardy
trees and shrubs around that bleak
school house in your district.
Are you considering a change of
seed this spring? It is worth while
only when you are getting some
thing superior to your old stock.
The University is about to issue
a bulletin descriptive of courses now
offered by correspondence. Several
couroes in agriculture are included.
Order the cultures now to inocu
late seed for that field of clover,
alfalfa, peas, or other legume you
are planning to sow this spring
The Department of Bacteriology of
the University is furuishing these
cultures for this purpose, delivered,
at ths nominal charge of ten cents
per acre.
Examine spraying equipment
now. Fill the spray tank with
water and allow to soak to prevent
leakage of spray material. Exam
ine the hose for leaks. Inspect the
spray rods; if any connections or
nozzles are needed, purchase at once.
Test the batteries and replace with
new ones if worn out. A few hours
careful examination and cleaning of
the spraying outfit now, may save
time and money later.
Now is a good time to outline a
definite scheme of cropping. Are
you cropping in such a way as best
to control weeds, smuts and insect
pests? Are you providing for the
lost organic matter, the black
matter of the soils? Maybe you
can use some of your fallow in rais
ing a cultivated crop. Fallow
used to save moisture and to kill
weeds. Possibly you can achieve
both results in some better or more
profitable way. The problem should
be considered from every angle and
a definite cropping scheme mapped
out.

W. M. Roe Dead at Juliaetta
Juliaetta, Feb. 20.—William M.
Roe, father of Dr. S. A. Roe, died
at the latter's home in Juliaetta at
2 o'clock this morning at the age of
67 years.
William M. Roe was bom in Bath
county, Kentucky, on March 31,
1849. At the age of eight years
the parents moved with their family
to Trenton, Mo., where the subject
of this sketch grew to manhood.
After attending the public schools
he spent one year at the Lexington,
Ky., University, and later took a
course at Bethany, W. Va. On
May 17, 1874, he was united in
marriage with Miss Lulu Christy at
Warrensburg, Mo. To this union
four children were bom—three
girls and one boy. One of the girls
died in infancy and the other two
are Mrs. Ina Swormstedt of Boise
and Mrs. Zelma A. Wahl of Med
ford, Ore. The son is Dr. S. A.
Roe, who was their first-born, who
is a physician and druggist at Julia
etta. His wife nursed him faith
fully to the end.
Mr. Roe united with the Christian
church at the age of 16, and in
1881 became a regularly ordained
minister of that denomination. His
ministerial labors were spent chiefly
in Missouri, having come to Idaho
in 1902. He resided at Lewiston
for two rears, then he came to Julia
etta.
Rev. Roe's illness—a form of
paralysis—began about six years
ago. While practically helpless
during the last two years, his death
was hastened by an attack of the
grippe about Christmas.
