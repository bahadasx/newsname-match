Perhana no phenomenon of
modern life Is more marked than
the prevalent mania for penal re
gulatlort of the petty details ol
conduct. There seems to be no
human aotion that somebody
does not want to prohibit. With
the intemperate exponents of
temperance we have beoome ia
miliar; the oohorts of Cotton Ma
ther havs reincarnated in Sun

around these oentral figures ot
sumntuarv lecis ation circles a

host of minor meddlers. Prohi
bitions under penalty of tine and
imDrisonment of the use in hotels
of bed shuets less than statutory
lentrth. and of the use of oracked
china in like Institutions are but
samples ot the absurdities that
have already found their way on
the statute books. And the craze
grows apaoe. Among the bills
reported as introduced in various
assemblies are those prohibiting
the exhibition by any nwrohant
of a olook whioh is too fast or too
slow, and of the use of faoe lo
tions by any woman under 40
vears of a&e. A recent bill makes
it a nenltentiary offense for a man
to put his feet on his desk while
dictating to a women stenogra
pher. And it is rather more than
a ioke. Thoughtful people com
plain of the growing disrespect
of law. Who could avoid disre
SDeot for such laws, and how few
can or will discriminate between
wiaa laws and foolish when both
are of equal authority? And the
misohlaf does not stop there.
