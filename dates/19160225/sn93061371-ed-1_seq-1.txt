! A FLAW IN TliE PUH !
By G. P. Fi?ftP.i,
fpilon to steal came to Davis
as the result of aorttbs of reflection.
It could not be said lo be tlie re3ult
of impulse. There was not the slight
est extenuation. Calmly and method
ically Davis made up his mind to take
fhfl five or mx thour.aiid dollars' worth
of bills wiiii-ii wmiW pass through his
hands on the following guttlfSay.
The money was taken out of the
bank on Snturday morning and placed
l'u tiie ??fi. During the morning Da
vis and Harvey, (h6 cimMiT, made out
the envelopes. Harvey hniiiti'd Davis
the bills to place in each envelope.
Harvey was ahort-sishtcd, and there
was a card index box between them,
fttjliiing would lie oasior than for Da
vis to place the empty' envelope in the
sate and slip the bills into lilit pock
ets. The salaries would be paid be
tween four nnd five. Davis' theft
would feinttin undetected from one.

wien Tie went out to luncli, tllTTourT "
Davis was not a bad man, bm, ki
mind was warped. He belieTed lllnv
solf to be the Tictitn of social In
lirrtiL'e. He bad laid bis plan wltls
the utmost essuranctV - At on h
would lent e th office, at 2:20 he would
sail ou board the Headtcea for Ert
enos Aires. 'With the last penny ot
h!s snvlnga h bad engagtd paatac
icr England on board the Lcodtceav
which left at three. He bad lingered
Just leng enough In the steamship of
flee, "ahI alted just enough Questions'
to impress Lirf Mentlty upon tli clerk,
and raise a HngeYlnf interest which
might, under circums'tfttKesv bKom
an active suspicion.
D2Ptft was twenty-nina, and ba sad
been witll the corporation eu
years, waiting paftentty for bis chance
Cohen, the present ma&fittr, bad told
Davis In strict confidence that hit was
leaving; he had had a better 0Hrv
"Say, Davis, know why old Kr4?b
turned you down before?" he askeo,
"Spruce up, old matt. Don't be a slov
en. Get a fifty-dollar euit and tlrkl
the old man's pride. And, say! Ever
not! that your cuffs are frayed?
Tickle lb (rid man, make him think
he's paying f&it fins wages, f yon
want to get on hts flgbt side"
Davis repulsed Cohen' confidences.
He was too bitter Just then to think of
flattering Krebs. Besides, he bad al
ready begun to formulate his scheme.
He bought the new suit, however.
That was part of the game. They
chaffed him on his spruce appearand
at the oflice oft the Saturday roornmg,
but Davis said nothing. He hung up'
his coat, put on the old cWce one, and
set to Work. ,
He was iii high good-humor, anil yoa
sessed by a sort Of reckless audacity
Which made the carrying out of th
plan easy. Ho almost laughe4 as It
adroitly slipped the bills into Mar
pockets under Harvey'a very eyes, nnd
placed the empty envelopes In the
safe. By noon, when the cashier went
out to his lunch, he had amassed near-'
ly fly? thousand dollars.. . J
He waited till Harvey returned;
then he went out Ot the cage Into the
president's room.
"I am thinking of leaving yon short
ly, Mr. Krebs," .aid Davis,
"All right," said Krebs.
Davis was taken aback. Krebs had
scored there. Davis stood looking at
him uneasily.
"I wish I could stay, sir," he con '
tlnuctl, "fait I have the offer ot a po
sition lu Cuba, to manage an estate,
and it Is too good to refuse."
Krebs seemed to wake vp at that.''
Ills eyes began to bulge. IJ looked
at Davis as If he wondered at he
transformation In the slovenly clerV
appearance. Krebs hated losing men.
"Wait a minute!" he said. "See
here, young man. If you go lo Cuba
you'll get malaria and yellow fever,'
and die. I was thinking of making
you an offer. Mr. Cohen is leaving us
next month. I was counting on you to
fill his place. How much la your new
position worth?" ,
"I'm not at liberty to say," said Da
vis. "I'm sorry, air, that I can't recon
sider the matter."
Krebs reddened and glared at hint.
"What do you mean, yon 'can't recon
sider'?" he growled. "Mr. Cohen I
getting twenty-five hundred. How
would that aura appeal to you?"
"It wouldn't appeal at all," said Da
vis, enjoying his triumph. "You'va
ground me down for years and paid
mo a dog's wages. You urtf1 an In
fernal old skinflint, and I wouldn't
work for you for twice that money." (
Davis withdrew. He knew that
Krebs would be gnawing bis nails
with rage that night when he dis
covered the amount - of the loss.
He had recovered his good humor by
the time he was in the street. He
made his way -direct to the wharf,
picked up his suit-case en route, and
boarded the "Boadicea" five minutes
before she sailed.
He stood beside the rail looking
back at the receding pancrama ct New
York. He lit a cigar.
"I'll take a deck chair, steward," ha
said.
"One dollar, please," said the stew
ard. Davis felt In his pockets. He fll4
up a dime and a nickel. He felt for
a bill. Ilia pockets were empty.
He had lelt the coat with the bills
in the office, in the cashier's cage,
