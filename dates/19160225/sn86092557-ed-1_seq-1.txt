GOODWORKDQNEAT
FARMERS'SCHOOL
Prof. Keys and Miss Cora
Price Gave Interesting
Talks Today.
Besides the great amount of good
which the Farmer's Extension School
has done in the way ol instructions and
distribution of fundamental' informa
tion about farming, it has also worked
another quite as important, that ot In
flating the ranks of the Marion County
Farm bureau.
The Marion County Farm bureau
several days ago at a meeting held
in the county court room, decided that
the price ot membership should be re
duced from 92.50 a year to ?l.This In
ducement, followed by the publication
of the fact that members of the bureau
were entitled to attend free the exten
sion school being held at Farmington,
served to bring about a rush among
the non-members to get a chance to
Join.
Professor Kemp, who has been away
from tho meeting on account of ill
ness. arrived at Farmington this
morning and tilled Ills place on the
program. During the afternoon Miss
Cora Price gave an Interesting talk
on the work her Girls' club is doing,
and spoke of the work which she has
in mind for the ensuing year which
will bring the l'ruit and vegetable pre
serving art up to the highest mark ot
efficiency In this county.
Professor Kemp this morning spoke
of "Our Problem." in which he dis
cussed about everything with which a
farmer had to do and spoke of these
things in an instructive manner. Fol
lowing this. Prof. Ragsdale on "Farm
ing and the Dairy Cow", took up the
rest of the morning in which he ex
plained tho many dairy matters iCom>
ing before the Marlon County Farm
bureau which have been brought to his
notice.
The afternoon session started at 1.30
with almost 100 studonts in the class.
"Crop notation" by Professor Kemp,
was the opening lecture. It Is the opln
ion of tho professor that the farmers
<tt Marlon county do not rotate their
crops enough to allow the soli to grow
rich. "The constant raising of one
crop." he claimed, "would bring the
soil to not one half the richness that
a threo years' rotation would."
Professor Ragsdale, on "Economic
Feeding," was heard for the first time
during the classes, following the crop
rotation lecture.
There is a method of feeding at pres
ent being followed by many farmers
in this county which is classed as the
best in the text book on such Instruc
tions. The work which County Agent
H..L. Smith has accomplished in mak
ing tho farmers in thir county realiza
the proper feod t,o bo used and cor
rect amount to be given tho stock, has
brought tho Marlon county fanner
far above the average in this line.
After the classes the boys of the
Farmington high school were discuss
ing whether or not it would be possible
to have a game of basketball for the:
benoflt of tho farmers and breeders
who were already In Farmington and
who would not object to watching a
good game.
Should they decide to have the game,
it will be played at the high school
between two.school teams selected for
the occasion. .

Woman" Politician's Charge
Threaten to Shake City
Administration to
the Core.
CHICAGO, Feb. 2o.-Uproar<and con
fusion marked the'opening session to
day of the city 'council committee in
vestigating the split salary charges
mads by Mrs. Page Waller'Eaton re
signed superintendent of social sur
veys against her former superior Mrs.
Louise Osborne Howe . commissioner
of the department of public welfare.
Clashes of authority .between the
city and civil service commission and
a council committee may develop In
tho Investigation. Both bodies Have
asked the principals in the contro
versy to appear before them. The com
mission has authority to issue sub
poenas and compel attendance: tlio
council committee has no such power.
The council committee has asked
Mayor Thompson and his wife, and
Mrs., Margaret E. Mivelaz sister of
Mrs. Thompson and alleged recipient
of the graft money, to appear. Tlio
mayor and his wife have also been
summoned to appear before the com
mission, and it is said, will be pres
ent. They will decline, it is expect
ed. lo appear before the council com
mittee.
Mrs. Margaret E. Mivelaz sister-in
law of the mayor is the widow of John
Mivelaz, who was a wel-to-do restaur
ant keeper in Louisville. Despatch
es from Louisville today said that
Mivelaz left an estate valued at $80;
000. Mrs. Mivelaz has denied that
she was in financial need.
Mrs. Eaton was appointed superin
tendent of social surveys last spring
by Mayor "Big BUI" Thompson, whom
she supported in the campaign.
Her Balary was $3000 a year. Hor
first official order, she charges waB to
"come across" with one-third of her
salary to,support the. mayor's sister
in-law, Mrs. Margaret Mivelaz, "un
til the maypr could make a place for
her." She says she was told the may
or needod help because ho was under
honvy expense.
"In June I gave a check for $S3, a
third of my monthly salary, to Mrs.
Rowe," said Mrs. Eaton.
"The city hall. 1 found, was honey
combed with plotters. I was being
made a party to corruption. I knew
what an attack on the grafters would
moan to mo." The world hatos a
squealer.
"But 1 decided to make the fight for
pure politics. When I got evidence
I resigned."'
The "petticoat political" war has
drawn the city council, the?civil serv
!zn commission and the state's attor
noy Into the battlefield, and a three
cornered Investigation of "payroll,
tapping" is under way.
Mrs. Eaton threatens to shaSe the
Thompson administration to its politi
cal foundation. She is a prominent
leader In Illinois suffrage and well
known as a writer and club woman.
The Eatori-Rowe investigation ia
said to" be1 the first ^political '-"graft
scandal" to' center around; women, of
fice holders. '

To Weston Hospital
DRINKS HE CONSUMED LONG AGO
ARE CAUSING TROUBLE FOR
ANTONIO COSTON
Antonio Coston, . an Italian miner
from near Klngmont, was committed
to the State Hospital for the Insane,
at Weston, by the county lunacy com
mission this morning.
Antonio appears rational most of
the time but every once in a while
he seems to be moonstruck and ram
bles around talking to himself and
acting In a strange and irresponsible
manner that has caused him to be
feared by his fellow employes and
friends. , .
After a thorough examination by
Drs. Yost and Harness it was decid
ed to ship the unfortunate man to
Weston, where it is thought that a
cure can be effected. Although he
said that lie had been drinking but
little recently It is thought that the
man Is suffering from alcoholic de
mentia caused by excessive drinking
in his past history.
