ESTABLISHED 1845.
Will Vote and Use His Influence
For Passage of Witten-Shu
mate Bill to Make Poeahon
tas Dry on May 1st.
Senntor Royall was here on Monday
attending to business matters, re?
turning to Richmond on the late train.
When asked by a representative of
this paper, "the why" of the Witten
Shumate bill, and his attitude towards
it, he said that he didn't know any?
thing as to "why" but that he had
made up his mind to vote for the bill
when it came up, and if defeated it
would be done by the Senate. He.
put the responsibility, if any, up to
Mr. Witten, who is supposed to be in
close touch with the people, and to
know and reflect their wishes. To
vote against the Witten-Shumate bill
notwithstanding the November first
clause in the enabling act, would ap?
pear to be voting "wet" he said,
which he had no idea of doing.
Public sentiment is divided consid?
erably in this town among all parties,
'wets and dry," included. While every?
body so far ns known, with hero and
there an exception. The more radi?
cal part of thq people say, "Yes, close
them out, and the quicker the better."
The more conservative say, we ought
to abide by tho contract. If the
terms of the enabling act were chang?
ed with regard to the whole state, the
case might bo different." Others still
say, that it is a question, whether
having made a bad promise wheth?
er not it is obligatory upon us to
abide by it. There are many men of
many minds, and many birds of many
kinds!1 We heard a preacher say once
that a lie was sometimes entirely
justifiable. "There are ways of kill?
ing a dog besides choking him on but?
ter."
MAPP BILL AMENDED BY THE
SENATE.
Richmond, Vn., Feb. 23.?No vote

hage of the Mapp prohibition bill in

000 per annum for two years for ex?

P er of Mr. and Mrs. C. A. Wagner.

_TAZEWELL, VI
THE IMPORTANCE
OF MAINTENANCE
Prominent Road Authority Says
It U Criminal to Vote Mon?
ey For Highways With No
Funds For Up-Keep.'
Every good roud completed brings n
new problem to the surface, viz: it's
maintenance. These good, costly
roods wear out. Everything wears
mit whatever it costs.
The more costly a piece of prop?
erty the better care should be taken
of it. A stitch in time, too, saves
nine. To begin early to repair the
first break, or bettor still to strength
Jti the weak places before tho break
occurs, saves time and money. A
?ood road, however good, allowed to
stand for as much as three years un
ier constant use, without any repairs,
will cost perhaps twice as much to
repair as if taken in hand soon after
.?omplet.ioii. This statement certainly
is true where the road carries heavy
traffic; and automobile travel.
The county engineer estimutcs that
die repairs to 100 miles of good road
ivill cost $500 per mile, if this esti?
mate is not too high the amount ne
:essary to maintain our roads is about
louble the county's road income.
What will be the plan adopted to
provide Tor this extra amount and
it the same time provide for the pay
nent of the bond issue money?
The Board of Supervisors and the
authorities will "tussle" with this
>roblem.
Mr. H. G. Shirley, Maryland's chief
?oad engineer of road construction,
n the January issue of Southern Good
Roads, discusses in detail and at
ength, the question of road mainto
lance. Here are a few select inter*
.?sting statements he makes:
"It is folly and. even criminal, for a
egislature or other body to create a
jond issue or appropriate large sumo
)f money to construct roads without
unking provision for their up-keep.
The maintenance of n road should
start tho day it is accepted from the
:ontraclor, and should be given con?
stant care and attention thereafter
with the exception of possibly two or
.hree months during the winter."
Mr. Shirley goes on to discuss the
lifferent kind of roads and their up
ccep.
McAWiim Boads.
On the up-keep of macadam roads,
ic says:
To properly maintain a macadam
road under heavy motor traffic so uni?
versal these ?days, it is necessary to
l.reat the road with an asphalt or tar
it least once every three years?and
octter, once every two years. Under
jxceedingly heavy traffic it is desira
jlc to treat it every year."
Cost of Oil or Tar Bonds.
On the roads in Mnrylund, from
jiie-lifth to three fourths gallons per
square yard was used, at an average
cost of a little less than $1150 per
mile. The cost of oiling the roads
will vary, of cou'-se, according to cir?
cumstances. To properly maintain a
macadam rood, as Mr. Shirley states,
is from $200 to $600 per mile. Mr.
Martin, road engineer here, puts the
cost of maintaining the roads in this
county now, at about $500 per mile.
The cost would be less if the up-keep
work had been commenced at the
proper time, but now, some of our fine '
roads have been in constant use for
more than three years, and are show-1
ing considerable wear. The longer j
the repair work is put off the worse j
the roads will be and the grentcr the
cost.
GREEVER-SLUSS.
Pretty Weeding at Home of Bride's
Parents at Graham.
The Graham Daily News of Wed?
nesday morning says: A very pretty
home wedding was solemnized last
evening at 9 o'clock at the home of
Mr. and"' Mrs. J. H. Sluss, on Vinccl
street, when their second daughter,
Miss Hazel, became the wife of Mr.
Henry Bowen Groover, of Bluefield.
The ceremony was performed by Dr.
M. P. Carico, the bride's pastor, and
was witnessed only by the immediate
family. /There were no invited guests.
The spacious Sluss home was pret?
tily decorated with carnations and
evergreens and cherries. The mar?
riage took place in the parlor and
tho ring service Was used. The
bride was charmingly attired in a
gown of blue cloth and held in her
hand a lovely boquct of red roses.
The groom was stately in the conven?
tional black.
The bride is well known and has
many friends. She was educated at
Martha Washington College, Madison
Hall Seminary, Washington, D. C,
and at the Southern Seminary. She
is accomplished in music and art. She
has always been a general favorite
^ere in Graham, where she was rear?
ed, and is known for her lovely dis
RGINIA, FRIDAY, FEBRUARY
position and congenial manner.
The groom is the son of Dr. G. W.
Greever, of Tazewell, who occupies
the position of Clerk of Tazewell
county. He owns and operates the
Bluetleld garage and he ami his
young bride wil make their home in
Bluefiold.
Soon after the ceremony the happy
pair boarded one of the handsome
Hudson cars of Mr. Greever ami wore
seen speeding in the direction of the
city of Bluelield, their future home.
HIS LIFE MIGHT HAVE BEEN
PROLONGED.
Tho death of Mr. T. O. Mitchell a
citizen of North Tazewell, occurred
last Saturday. He died of tubercu?
losis. Ho wns a young man, in tho
primo of life.
Lc3s thnn a year ago he was in
this office on business. Tho writer
noticed that ho had a cough?that
tell-tale "hack" and the danger sig?
nals were beginning to appear in his
face, lie was asked squarely and
flatly if he did not have some lung
troubles, lie replied that a physic?
ian had recently decided that lie had
incipient tuberculosis, but that he
was under treatment and expected
soon to be well. He was urged at
once to go to Catawba or some other
sanitarium, and at the same time,
warned that, according to the records
he might expect the worst unless he
acted at once. He said that he had
about decided to go away at once.
Again he was urged, and a few days
later, on the street, he again ex?
pressed a determination to go to a
sanitarium. At the risk of being
considered meddlesome "where he had
no business," the writer insisted and
urged him. He promised again. But
he didn't go until he became so feeble
that he had, so it was reported, to be
carried to the train on a col. He is
in his grave today. These facts are
recited for the benefit of others wdio
may now have, or at any lime here?
after have the dread disease?the
great white plague. To neglect is to
die as certain as fate. Taken in lime
a cure is entirely possible and prob?
able. The State is spending hundreds
of thousands of dollars every year for
the free treatment of the disease.
Ami yet, in Tazewell grave yards are
hundreds of her citizens, men and
women, dead, who might have been
saved to their families, themselves
anil society.
BUSTLE AND STIR
lias God a people on earth now?
Yes.
Are they actually carrying God's
message and doing his work now?
Yos.
Well, when these pecple of God
present the claims of Jesus Christ to
unsaved men and women and they
understand that He is the son of God
and the rightful ruler of the world,
and these unsaved men and women by
acts of stubbornness icfuse to accept
his terms, become his servants and
obey his laws, they arc then and
there living in rebellion against the
kingdom of Heaven of which Christ
is king.
Thon if I Sam., 16-28 be true, (for
rebellion is a sin of witchcraft and
stubbornness is as iniquity and idola-1
try.)
These persons being in a class with
witches and idolaters, will receive tho
same treatment at the hands of a'
just God. Ami the man who comes to
the death bed of one of these rebels
and offers him pardon on terms differ-1
cut from those God offered, this man !
makes himself a God, setting aside |
the justice and judgment of God.
While speaking of God's mercy,
we should remember also that he is
"just" God. W. E.

THE (HIETNA GREENS.
We. notice that a bill has been in?
troduced in the Maryland legislature
prohibiting the marriage of non-resi?
dents of that state within ninety-iiix
hours after tho license to wed has
been secured. Tha measure palp?
ably is aimed at Elklou and other
Maryland Grctna Greens, nnd indica?
tions ara that a determined light will
be made on it. Nevertheless, it is a
good measure and deserves to be pas?
sed.
I It is a pity something of the kind
isn't introduced in the legislature
of our neighboring State, Tennessee.
'Elopements to Bris'ol arc all too fre?
quent with our Virginia boys and
girls, nnd if our young people could
not frustrate tho wishes of their
elders with so much ease it is quite
probable that thoro would be fewer
divorce enses on the court calendars
nnd fewer unhappy homes in tho
old State.
Hasty marriage is an evil that is
on the increase. It would be inter?
esting to have the exact statistics as
to how great a percentage of clop
mcnts turn out unhnpily. There are
any number of hnppily murried peo?
ple "hooked up" in this way, wo nro
aware, but nro far more, we are
i confident, whose journey in life has
led them to the divorce courts via
some Gretnn Green. Every safeguard
should be thrown nround our young
folks by the men who make our laws,
.that in taking the most important
step in lifo they make no mistake.?
