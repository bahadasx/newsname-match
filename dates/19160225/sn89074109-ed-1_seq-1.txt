Box Car Thieves
Are Rounded Up
allow In Jail at Dickinson, Where the
Robberies Took Place.—W. H.
Neviils, Former Beach Character,
One of Gang.
The mystery surrounding the epi
demic of box car robberies which has
been puzzling Dickinson people £or
long time was finally solved last
week when five o£ the gang was
rounded up by the Dickinson police
ioree and are now awaiting hearing
in the Stark county jail. It is al
leged that the ring leader of the gang
•was W. H. Neviils, one of those cap
tured. Neviils was formerly of this
«ity, serving for a time as policeman
on the local force, later going to Bis
marck, where he was a guard at the
penitentiary for a tinVe. His local rep
utation is that of a tough citizen.
The Dickinson Press speaks of the
^capture as follows:
Mayor Alf White and Chief of
Police Pat Corbett were instrumen-1
tal the past week in unearthing a
gang which, it is alleged, has been en
gaged in the systematic stealing of
grain and merchandise from North
ern Pacfiic freight cars for several
weeks past. As a result, J. F. Mur
phy of Glendive, Montana, special
secret service agent of this division
of the railway, was notified, and on
Monday nght practically the entire
gang was rounded *up.
It seems that W. H. Neviils and
-JT. O'Connor, better known as "Slim"
and "Coil-oil Johnnie" boarded a
west bound freight train at Mandan
some time last Thursday night, and
-during the trip to Dickinson picked
out about $1,800 worth of merchan
dise, consisting of clothing and dry
-goods, and dumped it on the ground
just as the train pulled into the
Dickinson yards. It is then alleged
~that Newton Hougt, who has been
running a second hand store just
-south of the Masonic temple for the
past couple of months was on the
scene with a team and sleigh and
hauled the goods to the old Paddock
residence, north of the court house,
which he and his family occupy. The
sgoods were hidden in the basement
and barn, where they were later
found by the police and recovered.
This is the deal that lead to detec
tion, and the mayor and police im
mediately got busy on the case.
It was later ascertained that there
were others implicated in the gang,
and in addition to merchandise rob
Beres, tbey had bored holes in the
bottoms of freight cars containing
wheat, filled up a sleigh or wagon
load and later sold it again to lo
-*al elevators. The augur which was
used in the boring of the holes was
later found near one of the eleva
tors.
In addition to Neviils and O'Con
nor, it is alleged that Pat Peters and
Wilbur Skude were implicated in the
grain stealing deals, Peters doing
most of the hauling to the elevators
and selling.
Peters was married only a few
~months ago, and lately moved with
his wife to Miles City, Mont., where
lie was placed under arrest on Wed
nesday and brought back to Dickin
son the following day by Chief of
Police Corbett.
Hough, who is alleged to have re
-«eived the stolen merchandise and
secreted it about his premises, moved
to this city from a homestead in Dunn
-county a couple of years ago, and
has until recently been doing team
ing work. A short time ago he took
over the management of a little sec
ond hand store on Sims street, which
lie was operating at the time of his
arrest.
Neviils is quilt- well knrwn tt ough

this vicinity last fall, and is but1

The critic quintet is now lodged i.i

Chief of Police Corbett deserve espe

in rounding up this gang of alleged
law breakers.
Orpet Is Held
to Grand Jury
Chicago, Feb. 24.—William Orpet,
University of Chicago junior, was
held to the grand jury today in con
nection with the death of his former
sweetheart, Marion Fiancis Lambert.
The inquest ceased suddenly this
aft moon and the jurors retired im
mediately after counsel for the de
fense had given a brief outline of
their plans. The verdict follows:
"We, the jurors sworn in to in
quire into the death of Marion Lam
bert, on oath find that she came "to
her death by cyanide of potassium
poisoning and we recommend that
Wm. II. Orpet be held to the grand
jury of Lake county until discharged
by due process of law.
Orpet is 23 years old and Miss
Lambert, a high school pupil, was 17.
MR. AND MRS. SINGER'S
WEDDING ANNIVERSARY
One of the most pleasant social
events of the city occurred last Sun
day when Mr and Mrs. H. Singer
entertained over one hundred guests
at dinner, and a dancing party, using
the Elks Hall to accommodate their
large host of friends aid relatives.
Aside from the Jewish people resid
ing in Dickinson, numerous relatives
were present from other towns and
ninety plates were required for the
dinner given on the stage in the au
ditorium. The tables were loaded
with delicacies and everything that
could be provded to complete a
feast was served the diners who
complimented Mrs. Singer and her
friends in preparing the elaborate
repast. As the trains ran late due
to excessive snow and cold weather
the dinner was delayed until 9 o'
clock when No's. 2, 7, and 8 arrived
bringing numerous guests from
neighboring cities.
Following the dinner, the guests
indulged in dancing to the music of
a local orchestra until about two
o'clock the following morning. Many
very beautiful costumes were worn,
and a number of valuable gifts were
given Mr. and Mrs. Singer by the
guests and relatives. They have been
here abont ten years, coming from
Minneapolis, and their list of friends
is very large. The out of town
guests included Mr .and Mrs. Rosen
berg of Beach and many others.

FARMER HAD BEST ARGUMENT
A farmer who was carrying an
express package, from a city mail
order house, says one of our ex
changes, was accosted by a local
merchant: 'Why didn't you buy
that bill of goods from me? I
could have saved you the express
and besides you would have been
patronizing a home store, which
helps to pay taxes and build up this
locality." With characteristic frank
ness the farmer asked: "Why didn't
you patronize your home paper—
advertise? I read it, and didn't
know you had the goods I have here
nor do I see your name in the pap
er inviting one to come to your store.
200 Silos Sold
in One Day
Thomson Yard' Inc. Make a Not
?bie Recon. Following An Exten
sive Advertising Campaign.
Over $80,000 worth of silos were
sold by the Thompson Yards, Inc.,
in less than one day, following an
extensive advertising campaign in
augurated Jauary 20th and ending
January 27th by the company's ad
vertising department, in which the
announcement was made that the sale
would begin on Tuesday morning,
February 1st, at 8 o'clock. In
preparation for the event, the com-
following morning, all of the 200
ilos had been taken by customers.
This is a record of which the com
pany has a right to be proud—a
record which has never before been
equalled in the silo business.
Maager O. C. Holtz of the local
Thompson Yard has an important
announcement on another page of
this issue, to which we invite the
attention of our farmer readers.
Other important announcements will
appear in the Chronicle during the
coming season.
WESTERN COUNTIES
OVERTAKE THE EAST
The issue of the eastern portion of
the state against the western raised
in the capitol removal campaign has
led to much speculation as to the
proportionate strength of these sec
tions.
Dividing the state on a line run
ning along the western boudaries of
Dickey, LaMoure, Stutsman, Foster,
Eddy, Benson and Towner counties,
the sections are almost equal as to
population. According to the 1915
state census, the population of the
state was 636,994. Of this number,
318,481 was in counties west of the
line indicated and 318,513 in coun
ties east of it.
A glance, however, at census sta
tistics shows that it will be but a
short time until the population of the
western counties will lie in excess
of the eastern counties. In 1890 the
western counties contained but 31,
450 persons as against 159,533 in
the eastern counties in 1900 the
western counties contained 88,405
against 230,741 in the eastern coun
ties in 1910 the western counties
had 285,779 population as against
291,177 in the eastern countiqs.
The legislative strength under the
present apportionment is distributed
between these sections as follows:
Twenty-three senators in western
counties as against 54 in eastern.

DICKINSON TO HAVE FINE
(XVIC CENTER BUILDING
Dickinson, N. D., Feb. 14.—A civic
center building combining county
court house, city hall, auditorium
and commercial club rooms is the
suggestion receiving much consid
eration here following the request of
commercial club members of the
city commission to issue municipal
bonds and erect an auditorium. The
combination plan, it is asserted
would spread the cost and allow a
larger building.
This is what Herman Rosenfield, advertising manager of Sears &
Roebuck, recently told the members of the American Ad. club at
a convention:
"We have a bureau whose duty it is to read each week the coun
try newspapers from all over the country. There is not a paper
of any consequence in our trade territory that our bureau does not
get. This bureau looks over th se papers and when we find a town
where the merchants do not advertise in the local papers, we imme
diately flood that territory with our literature. It always brings res
ults far in excess of the same effort put forth in territory where
the local merchants use their local papers. Could we find a
stronger argument as to advertising by the local merchants?"
The power of advertising eannnot be measured. It is tremen
dous. Successful men are givihg it more attention than ever. The
Chronicle is a good place to advertise.
About
Implement Co.
Sold'This Week
Important Business ..Change ..Con
summated This Week. Promin
ent Local Men to be Identified With
Affairs of New Concern.
The Tri-State Implement Com
pany is no more in Beach. The Don
aldson Implement Company are in
their stead, as the result of a deal
consummated on the 15th of this
month «.
The Tri-State Implement Com
pany have been in business in Beach
for a goodly number of years and
had gained a large number of friends
and patrons through the good offices
of their manager, James Donaldson,
but for business reasons disposed of
their holdings here last week to a
corporation bearing the name of the
Donaldson Implement Company.
The incorporators of the new cor
poration are James Donaldson, J. W.
Woods and Charles Doubles, all lo
cal men held in high respect in our
business circles.
As the Chronicle understands it,
the new corporation will put in a
branch store at Carlyle, Montana,
where they will handle automobiles
in connection with their regular im
plement line. Mr. Doubles will
manage their store there. James
Donaldson, probably one of the best
known implement dealers in this
county, and former manager of the
old corporation as well as one of the
incorporators of the new corpora
tion, will have charge of their busi
ness here.
The new concern is incorporated at
$15,000, paid up, and will do a gen
eral implement business.
TO THE VOTERS OF
THE CITY OF BEACH
Believing that the administration
of our City for the next two years
should be devoid of all strife and
factionalism and that our City be
placed upon a sound business and
financial footing, we are presenting
to you the name of a man for our
next Mayor who we believe can ac
complish the desired results.
A man who politically stands
alone.
A man who wears no man's collar.
A man who has no friends to re
ward, and no enemies to punish.
A man who holds' aloof from the
factionalism of our City, and in pre
senting the name of W. A. Sprague,
who has for a number of years been
a resident and tax payer of our City,
we believe liitn to be the man that
can accomplish the desired results.

PROFIT ON FLAX STRAW
Emmons, X. D.—Two enterprising
farmers of Logan county are whil
ing away the winter hours, baling
and shipping flax straw and selling
it tp a manufacturer of building pa
per. They have shipped 55 cars to

on their time and investment.
The Chronicle stands for all that
is fair and square.
DIVERSITY ON THE FARM PAYS
Farm records show, and good far
mers agree in general, that diver
sified farming is most profitable. Di
versified farming means raising live
stock and various kinds of crops. Di
versified farming gives opportunity
for crop rotation, for distribution
of man and horse, labor, and for the
maintenance of soil fertility. All of
these are essential to good farming.
Crop rotation aids in maintaining
crop yields and soil fertility the dis
tribution of labor reduces the cost
of operation the maintenance of soil
fertility is the basis of all success
ful agriculture.
State Historical Societj
Diversified farming is of great im
portance because it gives the farm
er an opportunty to carry out all the
best farm practices.

fied?
Interested in a
Destruction Bomb
Whit Terrell,.. Wibaux county's
greatest "little farmer", returned
from the east Monday and left again
yesterday for Washington, D. C.
On his recent visit east he took in
many of the important business
points, including St. Paul, Minnea
polis and Chicago, and had an op
portunity to size up things in the
east as to how thjngs go in this part
of the country. That Montana is
ahead of them all there is no ques
tion according to his opinion. He
says that it is a common occurrence
back east to see a man dressed fit
to kill and wearing diamonds go into
a cigar store and call for "live cent-
ers" or "three for ten", and then
gold
walk down the street with a
headed cane.
Whit's trip to the national capi
tol is in connection wth a patent or
invention of a relative of his. This
patent or nvention is of an explosive,
that if carried out will silence all the
bombs heretofore invented for use in
either peace or war, and already it
has been highly recommended by the
war department of the United
States.
The patent will first be offered to
the United States and if- they do not
care to handle the proposition it will
he offered to the fighting nations of
Europe, so that befoje long we will
undoubtedly learn that Whit is hob
nobing with the Crowns of Europe
and our old friend Kaiser Bill. No
doubt that before this war is ended
either side will be using this bomb to
good advantage. The bomb when
dropped from an aeroplane produces
a flame which will destroy any
buildings with which it comes in
contact, and as the flames shoot out
as the bomb strikes, London could
be brought to ashes by dropping a
dozen of these bombs from a Zep
pelin.—Wibaux Pioneer.
CO-OPERATION
After all there was profound phi
losophy in the light remark of the
Irishman to his companion as they
were traveling on foot and came to
a guide board which read "10 miles
to Bostad."
"Come along Mike," said Pat, "it's
only five miles apiece."
If we could, as farmers, learn this
great lesson of companionship and
co-operation with one another in
many of the difficult problems that
confront us and which baffle us as
long as we try to dispose of them
singly and alone, we would find the
final truth of that old saying "many
hands make light work." What we
need is local leadership, some one tD
say "Come along it's only five miles
apiece." We are just entering upon
this new view of farming. It is a
field of wonderful possibilities and
benefits.—Hoard's Dairvnnm.
A Beach Booster
Beach Will Have
a Chautauqua
Arrangements are Definitely Made
Assures Beach of Some Splendid
Attractions in June. Committee
Is Appointed.
Beach's annual chautauqua will
occur June 24 to 2f, inclusive. Defi
nite arrangements to this effect were
completed this week when 11. A.
Hedges, field manager for the Vawter
Chautauqua system, conferred with a
committee of business men and farm
ers here. As a result, this year's
chautauqua promises some rare at
tractions, entirely in keeping with the
splendid reputation of the Vawter
people. Following is the program in
brief, as given the Chronicle by Mr.
Hedges:
There will he five musical organi
utions, one for each day. These
will bo varied in character and are
designed to meet the requirements of
the people at all grades of musical
understanding. The big number,
which will delight Beach people is
the Military Concert Band, and press
ing this hard for popular favor will
be Our Old Home Singers.
The Christine Giles company and
Mr. Ralph Binfiham will furnish mus
ic and fun for one day. The Bo
hannans and The Savranoffs complete
the splendid list.
A Big Band.
is
The Military Concert Band
brought in response to strong de
mand for big band music. It
said to he by far the people's fav
orite. The Ol.l lloaie Singers, as
one might suppose, will siirg the songs
of heart and home: songs that are
held dear in the memories of all.
Their splendid musical numbers will
be bound together by a cleverly des
igned sketch that adds wonderfully
to the effects.
is
The Parnells are man and wife in
the classiest and cleverest of musical
literary and make-up skits and fan
cies. The Savranoffn are musical
Russians, who display great versa
tility and present some novel and in
teresting instruments, including the
Balalaika.
The last day comes the Christine
Giles company, and the closing ses
sion will he a real joy night-. This
special thriller will be led by Ralph
Bingham himself, who for years has
been given exclusive control of the
Joy Night festivities of the Interna
tional Lyceum Association. It will
he a scream.
Celebrated Orators.
Yutaka Minakuchi, a celebrated
Japanese scholar and orator, will de
liver an address. This is the same
Japanese who so distinguished him
self as an orator in the "Men and
Religion Forward Movement" and
other spdhking tours. Hon. B. F.
McDonald, of Ohio Stewart I. Long,
and J. Fred Clarke, all standard
Chautauqua orators, are also booked
to appear. The lecturer for the
fourth afternoon has not yet been
selected, but the assurance is given
that it will be someone of national
repute.
As a big entertainment feature we
are to have Ducrot, the magician.
Mr. Hedges places Ducrot in the first
rank as an exponent of modern mag
ic and says that his tricks are both
mystifying and interesting, the de
light of the children and of grown
uus as wed.
A children's specialist will have
charge of the juvenile work fore
noons and this will be given special
attention in an effort to surpass all
similar efforts among the children in
the past.
Following is the committee, any
one of whom will be glad to renddz
any other information to those in
terested: S. R. Morris, president
Adam Fari«, secretary T. E. Hud
son, treasurer John L. Henton, Wil
