Wncn Buying a Motor Car this
Season Consider a
Dodge Bros. Motor Car
FIRST!
WHY?
Because (hoy are not making' a cheap car to
compete with (lie ford as many manufac
turers arc doing.. This they realize is im
possible.. Jfo automobile made has better
material and will give better service than
the F01U). One million one hundred thous
and Ford Model T motors and chassis have
been made and sold in the past 7 years, one
like the other, interchangeable with the
other, and all giving service, and these same
motors and chassis are coming out at the
ryte of 2,000 per day.
DODGE BHOTIJEJtS are following the
most successful plan of the Ford Motor Com
pany, in that one motor and chassis, 2200 lb.
weight of simple design, shall come year af
ter year, one interchangeable with the oth
er, with the service like the Ford plan given
to the purchasers, which no other manufac
turer has given or can give until they build
one successful motor and chassis, 8ft, lliut t
their dealers and branches can keep repair;;
at the right price in each city and town in
the world where motor cars are sold.
Come in urnl'lel us show you our stock
of parts and price them to you, then com
pare them vtith any other car and you will
lind us twenty-five to fifty per cent lower.
The Dodge is the greatest hill climber
barring none, this on account of its 515 horse
power motor.
Equipped with Eismao Magneto.
Your battery is not overworked.
Your battery only lights and starts
your car.
Equipped with a North East
Self Starter
Practically noiseless in its action and
Positive.
Equipped with Full Floating
Sear Axle
This means much to your car.
Let us explain why.
Equipped with Timpkim
Bearings Throughout
All wheel bearings and other bearings
can be kept running prfeclly smooth,
on account of their easy adjustment.
