In spite of the best care mothers can
give them this weather brings sickness
to many children. Mrs. T. Neureuer,

Honey , and Tar cured my boy of a
severe attack of croup after other
remedies had failed. It is a wonder
ful remedy for coughs, colds, croup
and whooping cough." It stops la
grippe coughs.

; giving them any of Pratt's Poultry Regulator to keep them
healthy ? Have you Powdered Charcoal, Bone Meal, Oyster

William H. I
It is with deepest sympathy that
we chronicle the death of William
H. Wheeler, who passed away at his
home Friday, Feb. 11th. at one
o'clock in the afternoon after an ill
ness of only two days duration, at
the age of 49 years. The funeral
was held Sunday afternoon at one
o'clock. The procession formed at
the home and was escorted to the
opera house hall by the Independent
Order of Foresters, of which he was
an old member, Knights of Pythias
and the Modern Woodmen of
America, the services being in charge
of the Foresters. Rev. Robert Law
ton, pastor of the Congregational
church offered prayer and spoke
well chosen and comforting words
to the sorrowing ones. Burial was
in the family lot at East Charleston
beside the remains of his wife, who
passed away in November, 1914. The
orders followed the remains up
Derby street as far as Pleasant
street, where they opened ranks and
the procession passed through on its
sad mission. The floral tributes
from the several orders and from
friends were many and beautiful.
Deceased is survived by., one daugh
ter and one son who have the heart
felt sympathy of the entire commu
nity in being bereft of father and
mother in so short a time. Also

Lengthens Life of Rubber Gloves.
A new process for vulcanizing seam
less rubber gloves has been brought
out, by which the life of the gloves is
said to be considerably lengthened
Instead of vulcanizing the glove on the
dipping frame after the several coat
ings have been applied, each consecu
tive layer is vulcanized as the glove
structure progresses. Popular Sci
ence Monthly.
