City Wants State Conven
tion; Joint Delegation to
Chicago is Forecast.
Tucson, Ariz., Feb. 25. Tucson will
make a bid for the Republican state
convention to select delegates to the
Chicago national convention and it is
believed that the old pueblo will be
chosen. The 1908 and 1912 conventions
were both held here. Former Gov.
Joseph H. Kibbej, chairman of the
state committee, has issued a call for
a meeting of the executive commit
ter for March 18, when the time and
place for holding the convention will
be fixed.
It is regarded certain that the He
publicans and Progressives will unite
in sending a delegation to Chicago.
Those regarded as most likely to se
cure places on the delegation are
llichard E. Sloan, Phoenix: E. S.
Clark, Prescott; F. S. Breen, Flagstaff.
John C. Greenway, Warren; T. K.
ntcliey, Tucson, and Ph. Freudenthal,
Safford.
SI. E Cassidy of Bisbee, is the only
avowed candidate for national com-
i mitteeman and will probably be
chosen to succeed Ralph Cameron, the
present Incumbent, who is living in,
New York. The majority of the
Arizona delegation will favor some
progressive nominee.

rights of American citizen- should ever un
happily be abridged or denied by any such
action, we should, it seems to me, have tn

should be.
Honor Comes First.
"For .ny own part. I cannot consent to
any abridgement of the rights of American
citizens In any respect. The honor and
self respect of the nation is Involved. We
covet peace and shall preserve it at any
cost but the loss of honor. God forbid our
people to exercise their rights for fear we
might be called upon to vindicate them
would be a deep humiliation Indeed. it
would be an implicit, alt but an explicit,
acquiescence in the violation of rights ot
mankind everywhere and of whatever na
tion of allegiance. It would be a deliberate
abdication of our hitherto proud position as
spokesman, even amid the turmoil of war,
for the law and the right. It would make
everything this government has attempted
and everything that it has achieved, during
this terrible struggle of nations, meaning
less and futile.
Kxpediency Must Not Displace Principle.
"It Is Important to reflect that if. In
tbls Instance, we allowed, expediency to
take the place of principle, the door would
inevitably be opaned to still further conces

and otiier humiliations would be certain to
follow. What we are contending for In this
matter Is of the very essence f the things
that have made America a so erelgn na

making virtually surrender of her inde

ily announce legislation refusing pass
ports to Americans traveling on bel
ligerent ships, or still 'better, refusing
clearance to belligerent ships carry

"No owner of helligerent ships will
claim 4that he has the right to safe
guard a contraband cargo with Ameri-
1 can. lives and no -citizen should be per

nation at a time like this.
"f.onntng; II. S. Army to Monarch."
"It would' be a crime against civili
zation as well as against our own peo
ple to become Involved In this war and
thus loan our army and navy to a
European monarch to use In settling
his quarrels.
"If congress has the right to declare
war. It certainly has the right to pro
mote peace by restraining citizens
from taking unnecessary risks, A
mayor keeps the people of his city out
of the danger zone during a riot. Can
our government afford to do less when
the world Is in a 'lot?"
