BIG DEMONSTRATION
AT WILLIAMSBURG
A Routing Meeting,
Indorsing Judge F.
D, Sampson For
Judge of the Court
of Appea's.
Special to the Advocate.
Williamsburg, Ky., Feb. 21
Circuit Court opened .here today
and there was an immense crowd
in town. It seemed as though
every man you met was in a hur
ry to get to the court house so
he might get a seat in order to
be in the meeting that was called
for the purpose of indorsing
Judge Flem D. Sampson for the
Republican Nomination forjudge
of the Court of Appeals from the
7th Appellate District.
A. D. Johnson Chairman.
At 10:15 the house was called
to order by Hon. J. B. Snyder,
who stated the object of the
meeting; and upon motion, A. D.
Johnson was elected chairman of
the meeting, and was called upon
to make a speech." He spoke, in
part, as follows:
"Gentlemen and fellow citi
zens This I con'sider a great hon
or to. be called to preside over a
bodyof Republicans, and for the
cause for which we arc called to
gether. Judge Sampson, is, in
my judgment, the best Judge we
gaverihad, andl believe, we should
"! 'nominate him for Judge of the
Count of Appeals."
F.M. Hart was elected Secre
tary 'nd a committee was ap
pointed to draft resolutions. The
committee was composed of J. C.
Birdr E. G. Massingale, W. II.
Alsij), J. Wes Perkins JI. II.
Trammell, J. A. Stanlill and
Hugh Johnson, who were sent
out t!p prepare resolutions fortho
occasion.
Speeches Made by
- Prominent Men.
While they were out, W. H.
McDonald, of Barbourville, was
Mlted for and mponded, in part,
as follows:
"Mr. Chairman and fellow
Republicans: 1 did not come
here to make a speech, but rath
er to see Miv (Id friends and ex
change v -i-ds of encouragement
for the sm-cessof the Republican
party next fall. I am a Republi
can; have always been one. I
believe in its principle;. We
need the walls of protection re
built around us to protect our in
dustries. We want a change in
the administration, -so that we
will not have to put a stamp on
our voice before we can talk to
our friends over a telephone.
"Gentlemen, I want to say a
few words about my townsman,
Hon. F. D. Sampson. I have
known .him from his earliest
childhood and have watched his
couiv.e with great solicitude, and
I have always found him to be
all that it takes to make a man
equal to any occasion. When he
was elected Judge of the 34th
Judicial District, there were
about 1,500 cases on the civil
dockets of the Knox Circuit
Court; there were nearly a thous
and penal and felony cases. lie
worked hard and by his untiring
eirorts has cleared the dockets.
He has put down crime in all its
cruel forms. He has made our
county better. 1 say here and
now that he has made the best
Judge of the Circuit Court Knox
county was ever blessed with.
He is going to be the nominee of
the Republicans of the 7th Appel
late District for the high office
of Judge of the Court of Appeals.
When they have nominated him,
he will win in the final election,
and the people of the mountains
will have their just due.-. They
will have a Judge of that high
court who will measure up to
the fullest requirements. He
will carry the old 7ln Appellate
District back into the Republican
ranks, where it justly belongs."
E. F. White, Clerk of the
Whitly County Court, was then
called for and said:
"I know Judgo Sampson; he is
just the kind of man wo want
for the high office ho seeks, and
we are for him."
The committee then annoum-nd
that it was ready t ) rep rt ar d
Hon. J. C. Bird. ex-County At
torney of Whitley coun'y. re:
the resolutions and moved the
adoption of them in one of his
characteristic addressee. En
dorsing Judge Sampson n hi
judge and jurist, he said:
"There is no better man for
the place he seeks, in tiiis dis
trict, than Hon. F. I"). Sampson."
Hon. S. II. hash, of Corbin,
seconded the motion to adopt the
resolutions in the strongest lan
guage at his command, which
was well taken.
Hon. Charles Finley then arose
and said:
"Mr. Chairman, I do not wish
to make a speech: we do not need
to be encouraged to indorse
Judge Sampson: we know him
and we are all for him."
Resolutions Read.
The resolutions were then read
and unanimously adopted, r.s
