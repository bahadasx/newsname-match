portant epoch in the develop

Governor Hunt was the
guest of honor, and many
other distinguished citizens
of the state were present.
The banquet room was
beautifully decorated, the
scheme followed being com
memorative of Washington's
birthday. Music was fur
nished throughout the ban
queting hours by the Shipley
orchestra, many patriotic
selections being rendered.
The menu discussed was
an eleborate one; the service
was excellent, and the spirit
of goodf ellowship was abund

W. L. Quinlan as toastmast
er took the affair in hand, '
and if any one with a speech
in his system was overlook
ed it has not been reported.
The Commercial Club as
an organization, and the
members as individuals, are
entitled to great praise for
the manner in which their
banquet was handled. Noth
ing that would add to the
pleasure of their guests was
overlooked, and the affair
was a pronounced success in
every way.
This club is an organiza
tion of which any town might
well feel proud. It is com
posed of progressive business
and professional men who
give freely of their time and
money to boost every enter
prise that will help the growth
of the town and the coun
ty. Its record of good things
accomplished is a splendid
one, and its possibilities for
future good works are wide.
Such an organization is
worthy of imitation, and the
citizens of Holbrook could
not do better than band
themselves into a similar as
sociation. Those from Holbrook who
attended the banquet were

ment in this country.
Mr. Clark informs the edi
tor of The News that Mr.

favorably impressed with the

the new railroad will be un
dertaken by Mr. Palmer and
his associates.

Bridge at Topock Open
The big bridge across the Colo
rado river at Topock is at last
real means of free transportation
between the states of Arizona
and California. Judge Root ac
companied by Mrs. Root, drove
the first car across the bridge
Wednesday morning at the in
vitation of the engineer in charge
of the construction worK for the
contractors. At that time it was
necessary to drive the automo
one over planks laid tor ap
proaches to the bridge, but since
then the fills have been complet
ed and the bridge is now practi
cally open for all traffic although
there is some little work yet to
be done.
Some of our people seem to be
under the impression that there
is to be a toll charged for cross
ing this bridge but in this they
are entirely wrong. The bridge
was built by money raised by the
government and the two states,
Arizona and California, and is
absolutely free for all who care
to use it. It is expected that
early in March a date will be set
when there is expected a large
number of visitors from San
Bernardino and Los Angeles in
attendance of the dedication
ceremonies which have been pro
posed before the chamber of
commerce and upon which a com
mittee is now arranging plans.

For a Billious Attack
When you have a severe head
ache, accompanied by a coated
tongue, loathing of food, consti
pataion, torpid liver, vomiting of
partly digested food and then
bile, you may know that you
have a severe billious attack.
While you may be quite sick
there is much consolation in
knowing that relief may be had
by taking three of Chamberlain's
Tablets. They are prompt and
effectual. Obtainable everywhere.

disposed of in Justice Boy er's
court Wednesday. Sam
Smith plead guilty to the
charge of petty larcency and
was sentenced to 15 days in
jail, the complaining witness
being Wm. Wooster. Judge
Boyer suspended the sent
ence. Floyd Thompson, charged
with making threats against
Edith Smith, was put under
in the sum of
bridges.
Systematic road dragging
is beginning to show its ef
fect, for the roads which
have received this attention
were never in better condi
tion for travel.
The distribution of road
funds for the outlying roads
is sufficient to make neces
sary repairs which will be
done as soon as weather con
ditions permit.
The advertisement for the
sale of bridge bonds will pro
bably appear early or about
the middle of March. The
completion of sale will take
at least to months. The pre
liminary office work is now
in progress, and actual con
struction may begin about
thn middie of the year.
Invitation for bids on road
contracts Nos. 5, 6, 7, 8 and
9, for 1916 have been posted,
other invitations forbids will
soon follow.
The work for the present
year on the state highway,
east from Winslow is nearly
completed. It is one of the
best jobs in northern Ari
zona and should be contmu
ed across the county. That
lately done east from Hoi
brook is on the same route
If any serious road trouble
is reported to this office it
will receive prompt attention

Severe Cold Quickly Cured.
"On December first I had a
very severe cold or attack of the
grip as it may be, and was near
ly down sick in bed," writes O.
J. Metcalf, Weatherby. Mo. "I
bought two bottles of Chamber
lain's Cough Remedy and it was
only a few days until I was com
pletely restored to health. I
firmly believe that Chamberlain's
Cough Remedy is one of the very
best medicines and will know
what to do when I have another
cold." Obtainable everywhere.
Flood Damage at Yuma
It is conservatively estimated
that the total loss sustained by
the people of Yuma on ac
count of the recent flood amounts
to $350,000. Of this amount the
damage and loss to personal pro
perty will amount to $150,000,
and to other classes of property
about $200,000. This is to say
nothing of the damage to the
irrigation project, which must be
met by the government, and
which, was large in dollars and
cents, although not of such pro-
Dortions that reparation cannot
be made is due time to take care
of the farms being watered by
the system for crops for the com
ing season. Yuma Sun.
