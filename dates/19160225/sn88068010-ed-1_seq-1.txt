vote of the delegation was car
ried. The resolutions submitted
by the committee on resolutions
are as follows:
We affirm our allegiance to
the principles of the national re
publican party. We believe that
the lessons given by themisman
agement of domestic and inter
national affairs by the democrats
has cured nine-tenths of those
republicans whose votes indirect
y aided our enemies to secure
power once more, and as a result
had brought them back to our
ranks and we welcome them to
their old home." '
'We denounce the cowardly
submission to violation of inter
national laws constantly commit
ted by Great Britain by restrict
ing and robbing our mails and
interfering with 'our commerce
with neutral nations.- We point
to the action, of Sweden as
worthy precept; for our nationa
administration to follow."
iVThat too proud to fight'
may have its apologists, yet, to
have American i citizens and
trality during the present war.
We endorse the economic and
business administration of Her
bert S. Hadlej as governor of
the state of Missouri, and in
struct the Chariton county dele
gation to the state convention to
vote for him and Hon. J. L. Bab
bler, state chairman, and Hon.
Richard Barthold and Major
William Warner for delegates at
large to the national republican
convention at Chicago."
A few short addresses were
made, after which the conven
tion adjourned.
