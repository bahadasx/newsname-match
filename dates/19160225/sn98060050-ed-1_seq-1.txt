GREAT BATTLE RAGING.
Moro Than 250,000 Germans Are. As-,
saulting tho Long French Line
Fortress of Verdun Objective.
The great battle on the western
front, whore more than 250,000 Ger
mans are assaulting tho Vrnneb linn
along a 2j-milo front to tho north of
1110 ioriress 01 vcruun, is too out
standing feature in tho current war
news.
To take the fortress of Verdun is
ono of the chief ambitions with which
tho eiown iirinco has been credited.
Tho present cIToit under his command ,
is on a scale that indicates tho most'
determined effort to break down tho
barriers and to get within striking dia-i
tance of the fortress.
At last accounts tho battle wns still
raging, both sides keeping up a con
tinuous fire from all the available, ar
tillery and throwing musses of troops
into tho fray. Losses on both sides
have been extremely heay. j

Tho French claim to havo held tho

they did in the woods of Caures.
Kast of the latter point the German
advance continued, the forces pene

FOR THE "RAINY DAY."
The reason why ninny people do not
have suflieicnt money to pay their
debts or meet their obligations when
they como duo Is because they do not
put anything away for tho so-called
"rainy day." They live, from day to
day, cither just within their income or
just a little above it. Tliuy perhaps
pay as thoy go, but do not take into
consideration that they may hnvo sick
ness or death in the family or meet with
somo misfortuno that will prevent
them from earning money. Then they
pot back and llever seem able to get
ahead.
Some ono has laid down five rules for
getting rich. S'p believe they aro good
rules for keeping out of debt rath
er than for getting rii'h. They are
spend less than you earn; pay ready
mo'iey, never run in debt; never antici
pate uncertain profits by expend
ing them before received; start a sav
ings account.
Someone has also computed the
amount of money which ono will have
by systematic saving of a few cents
each day. If you persistently deposit
every week in the savings bank, as
suming that tho interest rate remains
at four per cont, the result will be
as follows; $1 a week in flvo years
will bo $230.00; in ten years $034.04.
Five dollars a week in flvo years will
bo $1,430.48, and iilO years $3,714.10.

The hats of favorite sons are flying
into the Republican ring pretty rap
idly. Burton of Ohio, Cummins of
Iowa and LaFollotte of 'Wisconsin arc
among those who have doffed theii
headpieces recently. It is hard to find
an eastern man showiag enthusiasm
over any of these entries.
At tho recent meeting of tho Xatlon
al Association of Wool Manufacturers
tho secretary-treasurer is quoted ae
saying that "both directly and indi
rectly the Kurnpcnn war has proved
tho salvation of the American woo
manufacturer for the time being at
least. The second year of tho now
Simmons-Underwood tariff has wit
nessed significant change and marked
improvement ,in the condition of the
wool manufacture in the United States
because the national effects of a non
protective tariff policy havo been
averted by events over which an Ameri
can congress hau no control."
One result 'expected of tho national
dairy show nt Springfield, to which ref
erence has been made, is tho teaching
of New Kngland how better to feed it
self. This section now raises only
about n quarter of its food supply and
that is altogether too little. 'o ought
at least to produce the half loaf. Some
foreign countries produco t0 per cent of
what they eat. The coming show will
illustrate modern ngrieulture and our
farmers will learn many valuablo les
sons. Xew England farming is not at
all what it should bo even if wo do
raiso moro corn to tho aero thun tho
most favored sections of tho West.
Greenfield, Mass., still follows the
senseless custom (if dividing 011 part
grounds in voting for town ollicers.
It is surprising that so intelligent and
progressive a community should bo ho
narrow and partisan in local affairs.
Who cares a rap whether a man is a
Republican, or a Democrat, or n Pro
gressive or even a Socialist, if hi is
well fitted to fill a town office? In n
town where one party largely predom
inates, as in Greenfield, such a custom
would tend to exclude from holding
local offices citizens who may bo ad
mirably equipped to dischargo the
duties, and tho town thus loses vnlun
bio services. Brnttleboro has never pnld
any attention to party lines in electing
candidates to town 'offices. Strifo nnd
feeling enough aro engendered without
bringing political questions into locnl
affair).
BABY'S BODY HIDDEN
FormerWest Wardsboro Girl in Se
rious Condition in Lynn,P1ass.
In Hospital Told Story to Police May
Faco Charge of killing Daughter
Baby Born Sunday.
A despatch from Lynn, Mass., to
the Boston Globe Wednesday said:
"Mildred Corser, 17 years old, a
native of West Wardsboro, Vt., a
maid in tho family of A. K. Bangs,
137 Bellovuo road, lies in tho Lynn
hospital, in a critical condition and
facing tho probable charge of killing
her onc-hotlr-old daughter.
"Her father, James Cursor, a farm
er at Wardsboro, is on his way to
this city, it is understood, having
been sent for on information disclos
ed by the girl, who at first was ad
verso to telling about herself or fam
ily. "Sunday night, while members of
tho family in which she was employ
ed wore at church, Hiss Corser, ac
cording to tho police, was taken sud
denly ill. She managed to reach her
room after vainly trying to call a
physician on tho telephone.
Sho became desperate, according to
tho police story, when she heard tho
members of tho family returning. Tho
hild was crying and seeking to cpiiet
it, she gavo it laudanum, a bottle of
which sho says she had purchased for
a toothache.
Staggering to a closet she placed
the child in a suitcase, closed the
catch and returned to bed.
"Yesterday sho was taken very ill
ind a physician was called. He or
dered her to tho Lynn hospital. Press-
J with questions by the hospital au
thorities and police, she told about
tho child, and this morning the suit
"asc was removed to an undertaking
establishment, where the autopsy was
'ield. Xo trace of "laudanum was
found, but a bruise on tho head and
fractured skull showed tho physician
vhat caused death, it is said.
"Miss Corser came to this city
about eight months ago from Tur-
icrs Falls, Mass., where sho had been
"inploycd as maid. Sho is more thnn
militarily good looking, with nu
ibundance of brown hair. Sho dress-
'd becomingly. Tho police say that
tho father of the child lives in Tur
ners Falls."
James Corser, father of tho girl
mentioned in the Lynn despatch,
'ives in Wardsboro Center, but his
nostofiico address is West Wardsboro.

N'orthfield, Jtn'ss., and' nfioiit Thanks
(jiving time. Jfr. Corser bought a
dace in Wardsboro Center and has
'Ived there since them. The girl has
several relatives in West Wnrdsboro
on her mother's side, all well-known
ind respectable residents, and the
irl is well remembered there.
There is still no prospect of the end
of the war. It may last more then the
three years which was Kitchener's es
timate at tho beginning. The Ger
mans aro apparently making a tre
mendous drive at the French lino nenr
Verdun. The locality would not indi--ato
that they are attempting to brenit
hrough to tho English channel, but
hey are probably striking at the point
which thoy consider most vulnerable.
There have been indications from en
fonte sources that an effort would be
made in the spring to drive the Ger
mans from Belgium, The world ni
ready shudders at the cost, not only
in tho loss of life and buffering, but
in the destruction of property and in
the impoverishment which it will take
years to replace. The end will come
only with tho slow wearing down pro
cess of resources of men and materials.
Tho English economists and bankers,
despite tho failure of their past assur
ances, aro still confident that German
finances will eventually collapse, and
that this collapse will bring nu end of
military power.

OPINION AFFECTS 250 V6TERS.
Brattleboro Board of Civil Authority
Will Decide Question of Qualification
Saturday, March 4.
Considerable figuring is being done in
llrattleboro in an effort to determine how
many voters who havo been in the habit
of casfing their votes at town meetings
will be barred from thnt privilege March
7 if Brattleboro follows the decision of At
torney General Herbert G. Barber nnd de
cides that men whobc taxes were not paid
Feb. 3." are Kirred from voting.
Tax Collector V. A. Shiimway said
Wednesday- that he had names of 10!
residents of llrattleboro on his list whoso
taxes were not paid on Feb. 1. Of this
number ho knows of 07 who have left
town and he estimates that there are from
o to 100 names on the list of men who
are uot naturalized citizens und not en
titled to vote.
This leaves a total of about 250 who will
bo aficeted by the now law which no one
appears to have paid any attention to until
after the attorney general was asked to
give bis opinion.
The board of civil authority will huvo a
meeting .Saturday evening, March 4, to ie
vho the check list, and at thnt meeting the
question will come up for a decision locally
and will bo decided by a majority vote.
Montpelier und Rutland have decided to
allow ail citizens whose taxes are paid be
fore the town meeting to vote.
Attorney General Bather's opinion was
given to the secretary of statu at the hit
ler's request. It wns based on the law as
it stands und on nothing elfcc. It was not
given as advice to town olllcials, because
the attorney general is not called upon to
advise such officers.
