H THIS REGARDLESS OF
ALL QUALIFICATIONS
H" Eclipsed Logan's Record for this Year
H by Thirty-Six, and Makes Our
H Position Most Unique.
H. During the last two days of tho 13.
H' A. C. Round-up the registration took
BBJ a big jump, due partially to the as-
H sistance of citizens who insisted that
H thoso who had been attending the lcc-
L ' tUrcs without registering get busy and
H do so. As a result, the total regis-
BBJ tration for tho year was swelled
H to 58G, which is said to be 3G more
H than tho registration at Logan this
H year, and still further in advance of
BBJ tho registration at Monroe.
Hx When we take into consideration
BBJ, that after all there were a great many
H" in attendance at some of tho sessions
BBJ' who did not register, the showing is
L most gratifying, and Principal Homer
7" in his final address to tho conventions
BBJ expressed the most profound satisfac-
BBJ' tion over tho interest that had been
BBJ' shown this year.
H It makes our position when it comes
BBJ to arranging' programs for another
B year most unique, since we will ba
BBJ entitled to ask for just about any-
B. thing we want, and it cannot reason-
B ably be denied to us.

Hf BRANCH A. C. NOTES.
' Once again tho dark cloud of re-
BBB grct was cast over the school when
BBB news came from Parowan of tho
BBB death of one of the students, Silas
BBB Smith. Silas was a member of the
BBB Freshmen class and was loved by all
BBJ, the students as a bright, cheerful-
PBBr hearted member, whose every act was
BBJ, one of kindness and good will. A
BBJ feeling of deepest regret at his death
BBJ is with every student, for he will be
BBJ missed in tho daily affairs of school
IK- "ft-
BBJ
H- A number of students and Mr. Gar-
BBJ. dner have gone to Ordcrvillo to attend
BBB the funeral of James Esplin, a former
BBB student of this school. Mr. Esplin
BBB graduated from tho B. A. C. last
BBB spring and has been attending tho
MtJ" A. C. at Logan this winter, until he
WC was attacked with pneumonia, which
BBB resulted in his death. Mr. Gardner
BBB represents the faculty and members
BBB of the institution, who regret tho de-
BBBJ mise of this former member most
BBB deeply.

J The basket ball team has gone to
BBB Beaver, whero they will play the final
BBBj gamo with Murdock High, for the
BBBJ championship of the Southern district.
BBBJ In tho gamo played here last wcok the
BBBJ B. A. C. team was victorious, the score
BBBJ being 31 to 24. Should Murdock win
H in the gamo played there tonight, an-
BBBJ other gamo will bo played in Milford
BBBJ to decide which of tho champions will
BBBJ go to Salt Lake for tho Stato meet.
P The second election of this school
H year is being held this week. Excite-
BBBB ment is running high, as both parties
BBBB havo strong tickets and tho voters are
BBBB finding it extremely difficult to make
BBBB a choice. Tho Americans have nom-
B . incited Ralph Sanford for mayor, and
BBBB tho Independent party has nominated
BBBB Scott Mathoson. Rallies of both par-
BBBJj tics havo been held in which a great
BBBB deal of interest and enthusiasm was

FOR MORE STABLE
SELLING METHODS.
Cedar City, Feb. 24, 1910
Editor Record; I am greatly in
terested in the discussion being carried
on nt the present time regarding sell
imf methods, and I would like to in
quire how it is that stores which claim
to bo soiling at actual cost do so when
"over-head" expenses of more than
20 per cent to 30 per cent must be al
lowed for, in figuring tho margain be
tween the actual cost and selling
price.
When a merchant with a 30 per cent
"over-head" advertises goods at 10
per cent below cost, docs ho not loso
20 per cent instead of 10 per cent on
tho transaction?
If a business houso continued this
policy toward tho consumer, as many
of them claim they do, their stores
could not Inst more than from thrco
to fivo months at the most, as I am
informed that the most these stores
can hope to clear is 5 per cent, which
is usually taken from discounts and
not by increasing tho marginal dif
ference between the actual cost and
tho selling price.
Is not such a merchandising policy
bad for tho consumer? Most of the
cutting is done on standard trade
marked goods well known to tho pub
lic. Does not .this practice encourage
tho substitution of inferior merchan
dise, which is urged upon tho con
sumer with tho claim that it is "just
as good?" On what arc these losses
made up? Aro widely advertised
brands used as "bait" to lure tho pub
lic into such an establishment to sell
them something else at a compensa
ting profit. Yours faithfully,
BUSINESS MAN.

Tho following resolutions were a

"Resolved, that tho women of this
conference representing tho towns of
Southern Utah, co-oporato with the

tho production of cleaner milk for tho
home.
"Resolved, that the Housewives do
their part in propely cai'ing for the

gauzo for strainers, providing cov
ered vessels and using other necessary
precautions for the prevention of
jerm contamination of milk.
"Resolved, that Boards of Health be
urged to appoint special women in
spectors to inspect all barns, corrals,
outhouses, and general surroundings,
with a view of bringing about n better

Furthermore, it shall bo the duty of

by pledge ourselves to greater effort
than over before in maintaining clean,
wholesome and sanitary conditions

Adopted by the Farmers' Conven

National Pay Up Week.
Pay Up Week has met with at least
some favor among tho peoplo of Iron
county, and a number of people have
gone as far as they wore able in the
liquidation of their debts. There are
also some who could havo done con
sideiablo more than they havo done.
To these we wish to remark that there
is still a little time, as the week does
not close until Saturday night, and
even if your remittance is a day late,
we believe the creditor would prefer
it then to a month or a year later.
Of course, tho event is rather badly
timed for this particularly section, as
it is a time of tho year when there is
very little money in circulation. Af
ter shearing is over, things will bo in
better shape financially, and then it
would not bo a bad idea to have a
local pay-up week.
DR. G. W. MIDDLETON .
MAY RETURN TO CEDAR
It has been reported to The Rec
ord that Dr. Middleton, one of the
foremost surgeons nt tho L. D. S.
Hospital in Salt Lake City and a for
mer citizen of this placo, is serioualy
considering returning to make his
home here. It is said that tho life
tho doctor has been living for the
past sovoral years is proving too se
vere for his strength, and feels that
in justice to himself and family he
should seek a moro secluded and less
nrdorous lifq. With this in mind his
thoughts naturally turn towards Ced
ar City, whore the most of his people
reside, whero his father and mother
aro buried, and whero the happy days
of his youth were spent.
And the peoplo here, knowing his
sterling qualities as a man, his high
Ideals and progressive ideas would be
more than delighted to welcome him
home again, even though ho has been
mingling for some years with tho
saints in Zion. It is stated that it
is the doctorfsjjexpressed intention the
present seSjwn to employ a talented
landscapoyjfafdner at his own expense
for a termf months to beautify and
cultivate tho local cemetery, and make
t a place of beauty and a credit J

PRESSED BR&'fACTORY
FOR CEDAR CITY PEOPLE
It is reliably reported to Tho Rec
ord that the machinery for a pressed
brick factory of the latest typo has
been ordered and is expected to ar
rive hero within the next few days.
A. J. Nemzcr. tho tailor, the Green
Brothers, who nave had considerable
experience in tho brick business, and
other local people, backed with, a num
ber of contracts for tho product of
tho plant, are interested in the ven
ture. This is something of which tho peo
ple of this section aro much in need,
and it is welcome news to all that
one more of their needs Is to bo met.
It has been a positive waste of cn
rgy and money to import a heavy
product of this kind from the north,
when it could just as well bo manu
factured at home.
Another industry that should bo en
couraged here is a Portland cement
factory. We havo all the ingredients
needed for tho manufacture of ce
ment in our canyons, and with cement
occupying a more prominent position
in nil building opcrations.nll the time,
the value of a plant to this section can
not be overestimated.
LET SOMETHING GOOD DE SAID.
When over tho fair fame of friend or foe
The shadow of disgrace shall fa!j Instead
Of words to blame, or proof of so and so,
Let something flood be said.
Forget not that no fellow being yet
May fall so low but love may lift his head
Even the cheek of shame with tears It
wet,
If something good Is said.
No generous heart may vainly turn a-
side
In ways of sympathy; no tout to dead
Out may awaken ttrong and glorified
If something good be said.
And to I chargo ye, by the thorny crown,
And by the crots on vhlch the Savior
bled,
And by your own soul's hope for fair re
nown, Let something good be said.

VcgctahblcB Wanted.
Bert Anderson, president of tho To
qucrvllle Commercial club and ono of
the llvo wires of Eastern Washing
ton county, was in Cedar City yester
day with a load of produco with his
auto truck, and to a Record reporter
stated that big plans arc in progress
for the development of tho truck gar
dening business nt Toqucrvillo and at
Echo Farm. He states that precau
tions are being taken this year to get
the seeds into tho ground early, when
necessary in hot beds, and that tho
Dixie producers arc going to be in the
market with all kinds of green mar
ket produce, including radishes, let
tuce, asparagus and other products of
the garden, practically as early as
tho peoplo of tho Moapa valley. He
also states that provision is being
mado for a liberal amount of canta
loupes, which will bo ready for the
market by July 4th.
The matter has been tnken up by
the Toquorvllle Commercial club, and
it is tho intention to open markets at
Ihis place and Parowan, at least, and
have a man in charge to dispense the
wares without tying up tho time of
tho trucks in peddling from house to
house, or otherwise waiting for the
disposition of the load.
At Echo farm tho area devoted to
garden products has been doublod, a
condition which is also truo with a
number of tho residents of Toquor
vllle. By growing stuff on a larger
scale Mr. Andersons promises cheap
er produce to the people of this sec
tion whilo at the same time develop
ing a profitable business for thoso en
gaging in it at tho producing end.
Ho states that within two or three
weeks the market will open in a rather
small way with asparagus, lettuce,
radishes, etc., and that from then on
there will be something to market all
tho time up to Into autumn or early
winter.
Individually he has secured the ser
vices of a German who is a thorough
gardener, who will havo charge of a
15 aero plot on tho Echo Farm, and is
expected to accomplish big results and
become a prominent factor in the car
rying out of this program.
Announcements will bo mado from
time to time in tho advertising col
umns of Tho Record of tho produce
that is ready for or available on the
local market.
