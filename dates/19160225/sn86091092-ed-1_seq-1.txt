ferred to. . ,
VII. That on the 26th dav of N
vember, 1915, at Caldwell, Idaho, th
defendants maliciously anil unlawful!)
and with intent to defame, published
in said newspaper the following word
under the caption "Pricklv 1 ears
concerning the said plaintiff, and con
cerning him as such prosecuting at
torney of Canyon County, Idaho, and
in his capacity as an attorney at law
to-wit:
"PRICKLEY PEARS.
"Some day The Tribune will pu'
lish the chronicle of the year 1915 at
the Canyon County Court Mouse.
Suggestions for the chapters of the
narrative arc welcome; many in fact
have alreadv been handed in. Among
the suggestions are: "Thirtv Miles up

" 'As soon as practicable after this

manner and clearly written with pen
and ink, or with a typewriter with in
delible ink, into permanent records
all instruments, papers and other mat
ters and things relating to or affect
ing property in said County of Gem."
So reads Section 11 of Senate Bill
No. 97, which became a law and creat
ed the County of Gem. !t is plain,
clear and explicit. The transcription
of the records is made a duty of the
County Recorder.
"That an executive, legislative, judi

when the salary, wages, pay or com
pensation of such appointee is to be
paid out of public iunds or fees of
office, or who appoints or furnishes

than One Thousand Dollars ($1,000.00)
and such officer making such appoint
ment SHALL FORFEIT HIS OF
FICE, AND BE INELGIBLE FOR
APPOINTMENT to such office for
one year thereafter."
So reads Section 1 of Senate Bill
No. 16 which became a law and is
known as the anti-nepotism law. It
is plain, clear and explicit. Do you
see any way in which you might em
ploy your brother-in-law or niece un
der that law? You probably don't.
our sight is not as good as Mr.
Knowlton's, or Mr. Geisler. We re
spectfully ask: what is the prosecut
ng attorney doing about the flagrant
,-iolation of the law. The law is be
ing violated openly at the present
time and has been for months past."
"The anti-nepotism law in Canyon
County is a dead letter. We have the
brother-in-law of the County Recorder
employed in the recorder's office; and
also a niece of a county commissioner.
We have on the recommendation of
the sheriff a brother of the probate
udge employed as bailiff in the sher
iff's office, and a deputy sheriff who
escaped the law by the skin of his
teeth. A nice little family affair."
"The other evening our Probate
Judge had a little altercation with one
of the citizens of the town durjng
which the Judge expressed his opinion
of the county jail, the county attorney
and other things that came within his
purview at the time. He also stated
"we had framed to land
where
"we had framed to land
where
he belonged and would get him yet."
That is very interesting news. "We"
evidently referred to the probate
judge, sheriff and county attorney.
Framing seems to be a part of the du
ties of the present regime. We would
suggest to Messrs. l' roman and Grif
fiths that they muzzle the third mem
ber of the triumvirate.
VIII. That thereafter on the 3rd
..,.y of December, 1915, at Caldwell.
Idaho, the defendants maliciously and
unlawfully, and with intent to defame,
mbiished in said newspaper the fol
owing words under the caption

LORENZ 1916 ROAD SHOW
NOVEL SENSATION
Coming to this city next week at
the Bungalow theatre for two days, an
attraction of unusual merit at popu
lar prices, is the Lorenz 1916 Exposi
tion City Road Show. Judging from
the press comments of others cities
where the Lorenz show has been play
ing to record capacity audiences, our
readers will make no mistake in re
serving their seats early for this at
traction. which plays at the Bungalow
Theatre, opening Wednesday March
first.
The San Francisco News, in review
ing the Lorenz 1916 Road Show,
states as follows: In its fourth week
at the Savoy, the Lorenz 1916 Road
Show made up of the big feature acts
taken from the Exposition, continued
its remarkable run of capacity crowds
and smashing previous box office re
ceipts.
Dr. Henry George Lorenz, the fam
ous master hypnotist, who heads the
bill, proved to an audience of capacity
proportions that he is full measure,
"pure wool goods in his chosen line of
endeavor—hypnotism. His act is fill
ed to brimming with great features,
practically all of which were staged
with a view of nutting the audience in
a good humor. The famous funmaker
changes his program daily.
"Terrill," billed as the Male Valeska
Suratt, created a furore with the ladies
in his gorgeous gowns and jewels, and
was seen in the most perfect authenic
dances of East India and Egypt ever
shown here.
The Lorenz 1916 Road Show is a
seventy-five minute joyride of new and
novel entertainment, and quite a few
notches ahead of anything ever before
offered the public in the way of
something different.
Coming to the Bungalow Theater
for two days only.

HAZEL DAWN IN "NIOBE/* AT THE HUREE WEDNESDAY MAR 1
LANE WILL SEND AGENT
HERETO INVESTIGATE
BOISE PROJECT
Secretary Lane will send a repre
sentative to Caldwell at once to make
an investigation of affairs on the
Boise government reclamation project.
The charges that have been made, the
report that was suppressed and all
other matters effecting the rights and
interests of the settlers will be gone
into fully and thoroughly. The hear
ings will be open.
The above is the gist of a letter re
ceived by a friend from Mr. C. M.
Rankin, who was sent to Washington
by the board of directors of the Boise
project, for the purpose of laying evi
dence before Mr. Lane, Secretary of
the Interior.
Mr. Rankin was at Washington for
a number of days before he could get
a hearing before Mr. Lane. For a
while it looked as though the threat
made by Caldwell men that they would
see that he did not get a hearing at
the hands of Mr. Lane had been suc
cessfully carried out.
Congressman Wilson to Assistance.
Mr. Rankin got his hearing before
Secretary Lane through the efforts of
Congressman Wilson of Chicago. Mr.
Rankin has a brother who lives in
Chicago. He asked his brother to in
tercede with Congressman Wilson,
which he did and with the result that
the hearing was had.
At a meeting of the board of direc
tors of the Boise Water L sers' as
sociation held before Mr. Rankin went
east, Mr. D. R. Hubbard, a director is
quoted as saying that he would head
off any hearing before Secretary Lane.
Mr. Hubbard is reported to have said
that he would accomplish his rurpose
through Senator Borah. After Mr
Rankin had been in Washington some
few days Senator Borah looked him
up, and tendered him his services. He
informed Mr. Rankin that "I am here
to help you in any manner that I can
or in anv way that you can suggest."
Mr. Rankin then told Senator Borah
of Mr. Hubbard's threat. Senator
Borah is quoted by Mr. Rankin as
having said:
"My God! Do those people out
there think that Hubbard can lead me
around by the ear like that?"
Mr. Rankin stated that the people
would probably draw their final con
clusions fçom the stand he took at
the present time.
King Up In Arms.
Judge Will R. King, chief counsel
for the Reclamation Service, has op
posed Mr. Rankin at every step. Mr
Rankin says in his letter:
"King said that if Congress looks
into this it will not be one sided. 1
will see that they get Badley's side
too. I said that is just what we want
We want both sides heard."
Rankin Returning Home.
Mr. Rankin left Washington the
evening of February 19th. He went
to Jefferson City, Tenn.. where he will
visit his mother for a few days. From
Jefferson City he will return to Cald
well. He states that he has some very
interesting matters to convey to the
settlers on the Boise project but can
not go into them by mail.
Thompson in Washington.
J. M. Thompson, legal représenta
tive of the Black Canyon Irrigation
District, is in Washington at the pres
ent time. He left Caldwell about
February 11th but did not make
known the purpose of his present trip
to Washington.
Kuna Wants to Withdraw
That portion of the Boise project
under old New York canal wishes to
withdraw from the Boise project
Steps have been taken to organize the
New York Irrigation district which
takes in the upper end of the project
The rural mailcarriers of Canyon
county held their annual meeting in
this city Tuesday. Officers were elect
ed at this meeting, consisting of Albert
White, New Plymouth, president; I
H. Altizer, Caldwell, vice president
H. M. Snowberg of Payette, secretary
The next meeting will be held
Parma. Hereafter the meetings are
to be held in January instead of Feb
ruary, as heretofore.
Mrs. C. J. Portner of Boise is visit
ing with her mother, Mrs. Fowler,
this week.
FARMERS AND COUNTIES
WILL BUILD BRIDGE
Ten Thousand Dollars Have Been
Raised Already—Canyon is Willing.
Residents of Owyhee county,
Messrs. W. H. McConnell, Earl P.
Q. Marsing, Colin McLoud and Adam
Blackstock, have undertaken to build
a bridge across Snake river at a point
to be determined later, but somewhere
between F'roman and Nampa ferries.
Individuals interested have pledged
$10,000 for the purpose. The sub
scribers to the fund will ask Canyon
county to subscribe $10,000 and Owy
hee county an equal amount.
It is stated that the matter has been
presented to the county commission
ers of Canyon county and that two of
them have signified their willingness
appropriate the money. The third
member of the board has not been
heard from. The county commission
ers of Owyhee county will be ap
proached in the near future.
The bridge would be a great con
enience to all the people living in
that" portion of Owyhee county cov
red by the Gem Irrigation District.
BUNGALOW TO STAGE THE
LORENZ 1916 ROAD SHOW
Theater patrons will next week be
treated to a novel and pleasing ad
mixture of entertainment. Hypnotism,
comedy and dancing galore will com
prise the principal items on the not
able bill which Manager Watters has
booked for two days commencing
next Wednesday. After negotiations
tending over a month, Manager
Watters has succeeded in booking Mr.
Henry George Lorenz, the noted
American hypnotist, and his 1916 Ex
position City Road Show, which was
one of the features of the amusement
zone at the San Francisco Exposi
tion. Dr. Lorenz is too well known
a successful and entertaining dem
onstrator of the possibilities of hypno
tism to need any extended introduc
tion to Caldwell theater goers. He is
ell known here in the west and per
forms some of the most remarkable
scenes in hypnotism ever seen on the
stage. His "Death Scene of Dr. Jec
kyl and Mr. Hyde" is scnational, and
the many amusing tests with people
hom he uses from the audience has
created roars of laughter.
Chief among the array of talent that
goes to make up the Lorenz 1916 Road
Show is "Terrill," a clever imperson
Jtor who is styled "The Male Valeska
Suratt," will be seen in some authen
tic East India and Egyptian dances,
which some rare and gorgeous
gowns and jewels will be worn.
The press speak in glowing terms
of the Lorenz attraction which comes
to this city at popular prices. Starting
Wednesday, March 1st for two days
only.
Mr. Fred V. Allen, with his mother
Mrs. Josephine Brunzell, who have
been visiting the daughter of the lat
ter. Mrs. Julia Catlow, started to re
turn by automobile to their home at
Denis, somewhere in the interior of
eastern Oregon, about two hundred
miles from here. He had been warn
ed as to the condition of the roads but
was so anxious to return that he de
cided to try it. He got out about 30
miles on the JTordan Valley road
when the machine was stalled by the
deep mud in San's Basin, where the
machine was put out of commission.
They found others in distress at the
same place. Mr. Sanderson was at
tcmoting to take Mr. J. W. Stauffer
and Mr. W. R. Helm to Jordan Valley
from Caldwell, but found it impossible
to go further. Mrs. Brunzell was
transferred to the car of Mr. Sander
son and returned to Caldwell. Mr,
Allen arrived later with his disabled
car drawn by a four-horse team be
longing to a rancher.

IDAHO STATE FAIR WILL
BE HELD FIRST WEEK
The Idaho State Fair to be held in
Caldwell the first week in October
will be the most complete in the his
tory of the organization in the opinion
of J. B. Gowen, secretary. Mr. Gowen
has been devoting the last several
months in perfecting the preliminary
details and in securing the co-opera
tion of the various national livestock
associations.
"The friends of the Idaho State Fair
are enthusiastic regarding prospects
for a successful exposition this fall,
Mr. Gowen declared, and we are all
confident that it will be largest and
most comprehensive in southern Ida
ho. Our fair is noted throughout the
northwest as the leading agricultural
and livestock show in the state and we
shall endeavor at all times to maintain
that reputation.
"While not as yet definitely arrang
ed the premium list this year will
prove especially attractive for exhibi
tors in my opinion. The total value
of the prizes offered will be the larg
est in the history of the organization.
An effort is being made to have the
list completed and in the hands of
prospective exhibitors by April 1st
"In this connection I desire to im
press upon the farmer the fact that
the Idaho State Fair is strictly a
farmers' show, the policy of the or
ganization being to present to the
people of the state a complete array
of the best products of agricultural
Idaho. We have but one ambition
that is to make it educational and in
spirational for the farming interests,
Idaho's most valuable asset.
In line with this policy the associa
tion has secured the cooperation of
the Caldwell Commercial club which
has agreed to present an adequate
amusement program without cost to
the fair Under this arrangement every
dollar collected by the association is
used in the payment of premiums and
necessary operating expense.
Meeting of Stockholders.
A meeting of the stockholders of
the association will be held in the
Commercial club rooms, Saturday,
March 4. at 8:00 p. m., at which time
matters of importance will be discuss
ed and acted upon. I wish to urge
upon stockholders the importance of
attending this meeting. To assure the
success of the 1916 show it is essen
tial that officers have the united sup
port and co-operation of the stock
holders."
State Land Sale.
Ways and means of bringing the
sale of state lands located in the Boise
project to the notice of interested
parties was thorougly discussed by
the immigration committee of the
Commercial club, Tuesday afternoon.
The importance of the sale to the state
and project makes it imperative that
concerted action be taken by the in
terests effected in placing the condi
tions of sale and other information in
the hands of prospective homeseekers,
in the opinion of the committeemen.
To secure the co-operation of the
state land board and the Reclamation
Service in an advertising campaign,
E. H. Plowhead was named chairman
of a committee to meet with a com
mittee from the Nampa and Boise
commercial clubs for the adoption of
a concrete plan to present to the state
and government officials.
The committee also recommended
that the publicity committee join with,
the Boise and Nampa commercial
clubs and the Water Users' Associa
tion in the publicity campaign inaugur
ated by the bureau of industrial and
natural resources of the Chicago Her
ald. The plan includes showing mo
tion pictures of this section in from
400 to 500 cities in the middle west;
a permanent display in Chicago; des
criptive articles and display advertis
ing in the Record Herald.
