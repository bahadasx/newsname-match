HKILLIN, Feb. 25 (via Amster

fall before the attacks of (Jernian
legions was the opinion expressed
by German military experts today.
They pointed out that for many
months the French army had fiumht
desperately to keep the Germans out
of gun range of the Verdun forts,
but that from the positions the at
tacking forre now hofi it is pos
sible for them to bombard prac
tically all of the main fortifications.
If the French are tinally forced
to abandon Verdun, the salient held
by the Germans at .St. Mihicl will
serve the purpose for which it haa
been held since early in the war.

ARRESTS ARE DI
THIS AFTERH
Sheriff Bailey and His Depu
ties Expect a Busy
Time.
It looked like a busy time ahead
for herflf Charles K. P.ailey and his
deputies Friday, following the re
turn of the 1.'! 1 secret Indictments
by the grand jury in circuit court on
Thursday. Warrants were to be is
sued this afternoon and turned into
the sheriff's ottiee for service late
this afternoon.- It was also expect
ed that the general roundup of the
parties concerned In the indictments
would be made on Saturday.
Pecause of the unusually large
number, 1 o 1 being returned in all,
the issuance of warrants for the ar
rest of those concerned, has been
delayed. P.onds in each instance had
to be set down and the warrants
made out on the strength of the in
dictments. This is the largest number of in
dictments returned by any grand
jury in years. The largest number in
recent times has not approximated
40. An unusually small number of
bound over cases, it is believed, is
included in the list returned Thurs
day afternoon.
It i believed that the indictments
will stand, although it was intimated
that the allegations made by a vvifr
of one of the grand jurors that he
had no property, might in some re
spects invalidate the bills. Pros.
Chester 11. Montgomery said:
"I have nothing to do with the
choosing or impaneling of the grand
.v:rors." said the prosecutor. "The
drawings are made by the jury com
missioners, who examine the fitness
of jurors to serve on the grand jury
prior to plating their names in the
box. In a hasty examination of the
statute regarding the qualification
of grand jurors, it is not in my opin
ion necessary for a juror to owr
real estate.
"He must be a householder as
Fack was. but further than that
there is nothing in the general laws
governing the qualifications of
jurors about . being necessary for
them to be property owners,"
That attorneys representing
parties involved in the grand jury
in estimations, against whom indict
ments have been returned, would
attack the validity of the biP.s, was
the prevailing belief last night.
Picas in abatements, to question th
jurisdiction of the court, were to be
used as a chief factor In scoring
againt the prosecution in the actual
trial of the cases.

OP TO KELLER
Mayor is Due to Give Answer
to Two Questions Put to
Him at Three O'clock
This Afternoon.
TWO BOARD MEMBERS
ARE NOW IN DETROIT
Said to be on Hunt For Suc
cessor to Montgomery
and Other Local
Teachers.
Mayor Keller's answer to the two
secret questions that were put to
the city executive in regard to the
school controversy at a conference
between the mayor, F. K. Hering and
V. XV. Itldenour Wednesday after
noon was to have been given at a
meeting between Mayor Keller and
Mr. Hidenour at 3 o'clock this after
noon. Mr. Hering, who. with Mr.
Hidenour, was appointed at a cit
izens' meeting at the Chamber of
Commerce Wednesday night, went to
Toledo this morning, leaving his
fellow committeeman in charge.
The two questions- which Mayor
Keller has been thinking over since
Thursday's conference were sub
mitted to him in writing. It was
generally considered today that they
were of real importance, for neither
Mr. Hidenour nor Mr. Hering would
give any Intimation of what they
were until the mayor had made a
reply to them.
Early this afternoon Mr. Hidenour
was not sure that a conference be
tween himself and the mayor would
be necessary to get Mr. Keller's ans
wer. He said that it might be re
ceived over the telephone before the
hour named by Mayor Keller when
he would have his decision ready.
Only a few minutes were considered
necessary by Mr. Hidenour to get the
answer that will decide the school
situation one way or the other.
Arc In Detroit.
A. L Hubbard's willingness to re
sign as a member of the school
school board if E. 11. Kupel and Wil-
l'.arn Clem will do the same thing
Is still hanging fire, owing to the
fact the two majority members of
the board are in Petroit. Mr. Hupel
and Mr. Clem left the city Thursday
morning to attend a meeting of
Michigan's school teachers and su
perintendents with the view of till
ing the place that will be vacant next
year, owing to their own refusal to
renew I,. J. Montgomery's contract
as superintendent of schools. Mr.
Hubbard was in Chicago during the
day. returning to the city late this
afternoon.
That Hupel and Clem were look
ing around for more than a man to
fill the superintendency was the ru
more around the city Friday. The
two men were supposed to be after
teachers to fill the vacancies that
will be caused by a general cleanup
of everybody who favored Mr. Mont
gomery's retention.
In their absenc. those desirous
of giving" Mr. Montgomery at least
an impartial trial on the charges
made by Mr. Hupel. have lost no
time. Thursday night's meeting vif
the board of directors of the Cham
ber of Commerce unanimously pass
ed the resolution presented at Wed
nesday night's gathering of citizens
interested in the school controversy.
The petition, addressed to Mayor
Fred W. Keller was substantially
the same, with the exception of tho
insertion of the name of the body,

plan of action outlined by Frank E.

with starting the expose of the

Stephen Malato, attorney for Mrs.

city welfare department payroll and
of compelling lira Katon to "split"
her $3,000 salary, made the attack
when he opened the cross-examination

examination of the witness.
Malato questioned Mrs. Eaton in
detail about her two marriages and
her present separation from her sec

rupted and said:
"I've tried to prevent this sort of
questioning, because I know there
will be some houses in Chicago that

A man suspected of being Dr. J.
Grant Lyman, wanted in New York
for fraudulent use of the mails and
swindling, is under arrest here. The

garding himself, but the police be
lieve he is the man wanted.

cash and a certified check for $5, 900,
payable to "beater," and endorsed
by John H. Putnam & Co., which
was one of the aiiases used by Ly
man in New York.

where she was seen by D. Ii. Sweat,

tion was canvassed.
The president stood squarely on
his letter to Sen. tone, made public
last night. He insisted that the
honor of the United S'tates was at
stake and that there could be no
backing down from the position
taken that the rules of international
law shall be observed by the central
powers in conducting their subma
rine campaign.
The house democratic5 leaders told
the president they would do what
they could to prevent any Interfer
ence by congress until all diplo
matic measures had been exhaust
ed. They went immediately from
the white house to the capitol to
take the matter up with members
generally.
Sl-akcr Clark Talk.
After he had returned to the cap
itol Speaker Clark said:
"I think that the chances are that
Germany will postpone this threat
ened performance until after March
10, or perhaps until April 1. There
arc rumors to thai effect."
The ppea-ktr said that if Germany
did postpone, her threatened action
the excitement in the house would
automatically postpone itself.
The speaker was designated to do
the talking for the house leaders.
He declared that 1'res't Wi'son had
been told flatly that In the present"
temper of tho houko a resolution
warning Americans off belligerent
ship.-j would pass the house two to
one. The speaker said:
"The president's letter to fcn.
Stone and en. Stone's letter to th
president set forth the um and sub-
; stance of the conference outd of
an explanation made a.s to the tem
per of the house regarding the dip
lomatic situation with Germany and
tome argument on both sides.
Would Cany Tvo to Vnf
"We told the. president how the
house felt, in our judgment. I told
him that this warning resolution
would carry two to one if it ever
leached a vote on the Jloor. Some
of its supporters, I i-aid, thought it
would carry by three to one."
Under the present parliamentary
situation the speaker paid that it
would be some time before the.
warning resolution could be placed
in a position where a vote could le
forced in the hous There was no
chance, he said, of the resolution be
ing brought up today. It would bo
impossible to get unanimous consent
