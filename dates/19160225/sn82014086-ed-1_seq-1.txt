tem not as a matter of policy, but as
a matter of dollars and cents; tnat

FRENCH LINER ESPAGNE
IS UNDERGOING REPAIRS.
That is Given as the Cause-for Post
ponement of Sailing.
New York, Feb. 24. The sailing of
tne rrench line 6teamship Espagne,
scheduled to leave here for Bordeaux
tomorrow, has been postponed until
Monday or Tuesday of next week, ac

today by local officers of the line. All
passengers booked on the Espagne
have been transferred to the Lafay
ette, to leave Saturday.
The postponement of the sailing of
the Espagne, cthcers of the line eaid,
was due to the necessity of completing
repairs on the ship, which left drydock
today. Denying that the delay had
anything to do with the recent warn-
j ing to prospective passengers In letters

from German submarines, the officers
asserted that the line would continue
to book passengers on the Espagne for
the postponed date.
GUNNERY ON AMERICAN
SHIPS ON DOWN GRADE.
Admiral Winslow Does Not Believe
Navy is Even Moderately Efficient.
Washington, Feb. 24. Admiral
Winslow told the house naval commit
tee that gunnery on American ships
started on the down grade soon after
it had been brought to its most ef
ficient point during President Roose
velt's incumbency.
"Just lately," he added, "the depart
ment began working out a new sys
tem of finding . the fault with our
gunnery. They are finding them. In
my opinion, however, if we had had a
general staff, our efficiency would
never have gone down."
The admiral maintained that the
original plan under which the general
board was created was intended to
lead to a genfral ptaff. That, he said,
was the vital need of the navy: all
military functions should be under the
direct control of professionally train
ed naval omcers.

working condition before and after the
accident. However, it was testified
that there have been complaints of
the failure of the signal eystem to

The reviewer maintains that the op

but comprise an attack upon a wide
part of the front of which Verdun
forms a part of the rear support. The
attacks, he declares, are still held with

three other lines at strategic intervals
behind the first. These lines are more
solidly constructed and more elaborate
in their nature than the first lines, as
work on them could be done at leisure
