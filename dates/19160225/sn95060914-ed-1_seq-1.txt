TWENTY SECOND YEAR
GEORGE A OLN
WILL BE A CAN
DDATE
Popular Business Man Will Enter Race
for Nomination for Governor at the
Coming Democratic Primary Election
HIS NOMINATION WOULD SOLIDIFY PARTY
Mr Olneys Election as Governor Means that the People
of Arizona Would Secure an Economical Business
Administration in the Interests of All the People
THE GUARDIAN is authorized to announce the candidacy
of George A Olney as a candidate for Governor of Arizona
subject to the will of the democratic voters at the coming pri
mary election
It has been publicly known for many months that strong
pressure was being brought to bear on Mr Olney by the
democratic voters from every portion of the State in an en
deavor to induce him to become a candidate It has been rep
resented to him that he was the man the people wanted but
not aspiring to public distinction he until now has persistently
refused to give his consent to become a candidate
Hundreds of letters and telegrams have been received here
urging Mr Olneys friends to advise him to become a can
didate The people of this State wish to remain democratic
for they are democratic and it is believed that with a man like
Mr Olney heading the ticket that the party will be so solidified
that it will be impossible tor the republicans to elect any orhcer
either state county or municipal
It is particularly gratifying to the people of Graham county
that Mr Olneys first official announcement is made in his old
home paper Everyone in this section of Arizona is a friend
of George A Olney He lived in Graham county from 1881
up to about seven years ago when he moved to Maricopa coun
ty so we know him and if there is a true Arizonan one de
voted to all of its interests he is of the type of George A Olney
THE GUARDIAN could write volumes about him of his
private life among his neighbors and in Graham and Greenlee
counties we are all his neighbors but in a political campaign it
is only fair to the voters to give the candidates official record
so here goes
George A Olney was born in Texas In 1881 while
a very young man he eame to Arizona which was about the
time Graham county was created being carved out of Pima
county In 1882 he was appointed under sheriff for the east
end of Graham county which now embraces Greenlee county
He served in this capacity for four years In 1890 he was
elected sheriff of the county and served two terms and then re
fused to run again While he was under sheriff and sheriff of
Graham county i required a man who was all man to be sheriff
In 1898 by popular demand Mr Olney became a candi
date for the Legislative Council and the majority he re
ceived made the republicans turn green with envy Mr Olneys
record in that Council is a matter of public record During the
sixty days session there was not an idle moment on his part
all of it being devoted to the development advancement and
betterment of the condition of the people of the Territory
Following his services in the Legislature he was appointed
a member of the Territorial Board of Equalization by Governor
Brodie At that time everyone knows that the big fellow was
paying on an assessment ridiculously low compared with the
merchant cattleman farmer and workingman Mr Olney saw
this injustice and attempted to remedy it He showed clearly
the injustice of the scheme of taxation in vogue at that time yet
the other members of the board refused to act and Mr Olney
resigned stating that he could be of better service to the people
oi Arizona elsewhere He was not mistaken in this although
he guessed better at that time than he knew for here is what
followed
In 1905 Mr Olney was appointed by a demand from the
people of Graham county to fill the unexpired term of Eugene
Carruthers as a member of the Board of Supervisors of Graham
county the people realizing that the time had arrived when an
equitable assessment of property must be made He filled the
unexpired term and then was elected to the same position for
the long term and remained in the same position for four more
years During 4iis term of office as a member of the Board of
Supervisors the only real fight over taxation as between the
rich man and poor man came off Mr Olney stood square for
an equitable assessment the result being that in 1906 the tax rate
in this county was just one half the amount it had been before
When Mr Olney and his family decided about seven years
ago to become residents of Maricopa county we knew we were
losing a family hard to replace although he still retains large
interests in land and cattle in this county We felt that Mr
Olney was one of us had helped to make this county one of the
best in the State and that he really belonged to us
Following his removal to Phoenix he was unanimously
elected State Chairman of the State Democratic Central Com
mittee in which capacity he served with the same distinction
that he had in former official positions
The people of this county are delighted to know that Mr
Olney is a candidate for governor and so far the only one on
the democratic side His vote in this his old home county
will be the result of the number of democrats and we are the
strongest democratic county in Arizona

NUMBER 3
IYjE RESULT
Carl Hayden Favors Creation
of Committee on Flood
Control
ON N01KABLE STREAMS
In Speech Recites Damages to
Rich Lands by Gila
River Floods
As a result of the recent floods
in the middle west and southwest
Congress has received many peti
tions for relief In order to get
the matter of relief up before Con
gress Speaker Clark introduced
House Resolution 122 to create a
committee on flood control on non
navigable streams
The resolution came up in the
House February 3d for considera
tion and Congressman Carl Hayden
made the following speech
Mr Speaker I intend to vote in
favor of the adoption of this reso
lution As I understand thepur
pose of our honored Speaker in in
troducing this measure it is in
tended to create a committee having
jurisdiction over all bills relating to
Hood control whether the floods oc
cur on navigable or non navigable
streams Heretofore all such bills
have been referred to the Com
mittee on Rivers and Harbors but
that committee insists that its juris
diction is limited to the improve
ment of the navigation of streams
in order that commerce might be
promoted It is true that in carry
ing out this policy levees have been
ostensibly constructed to confine the
rivers to their channels but which
have actually prevented the inunda
tion of riparian lands and contiguous
sections This work however was
all done under the guise c f improv
ing the navigation of the rivers for
Uiebanefit otcomaoexce
I come from a State where we
have dry rivers and no harbors and
I want to see a committee established
that will give consideration to flood
problems on nonnavicrable streams
I can best illustrate the nature of
the relief that the people of Arizona
are seeking by recounting the dam
age done by the recent floods on the
Gila river I shall begin by reading
an article printed in The Graham
Guardian published in Safford
Arizona At least 6000 acres of
rich alfalfa land in Graham county
every acre of it worth more than a
hundred dollars have been washed
away by successive floods and if
something is not done to stop this
devastation even greater areas will
be tui ned from fruitful farms into
wastes of sand and bowlders
Mr Hayden then read the account
of the floods and an editorial which
recently appeared in The GUARDIAN
He then continued
It is no wonder that every time
I visit the upper Gila valley the
stricken citizens say to me Why
is it that Congress can do nothing
for our relief I am always com
pelled to make the same old an
swer which every congressman has
made for the last hundred years
that no money is spent by the Fed
eral Government except lo promote
commerce on navigable streams
and that therefore I can hold out
no hope to them
After quoting the press dispatches
relative to the drowning of four per
sons at Winkleman Mr Hayden
read the account which appeared in
the Florence Blade Tribune and the
Buckeye Valley News to show the
great damage done by the floods on
the lower Gila He then said
These newspaper accounts men
tion but a part of the damage done
by floods along the entire course of
the Gila and I would have you re
member that I have confined my
remarks to this one stream As a
matter of fact gieat losses annually
occur on every river in Arizona
No one doubts that Congress has
power to make appropriations to
promote commerce on navigable
streams for we have been spending
federal funds for this purpose for
over a century but whenever we
nsk for an appropriation to control
the floods of nonnavigable streams
the constitutionality of such a law
is immediately questioned
In one sense the control of floods
on a nonnavigable stream would
confer nothing but a local benefit
nnd therefore Congress would have
no right to authorize the expendi
ture of federal funds for this pur
pose But I maintain that no part
of our common country can suffer
an injury without affecting in some
degree the general welfare and
