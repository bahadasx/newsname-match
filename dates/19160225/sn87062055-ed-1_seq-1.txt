FLAGSTAFFMOOD BOOST
Nestling against the base of North
ern Arizona's mighty mountain, which
rears its head 14,000 feet in the air
(San Francisco Peak), lies the town
of Flagstaff.
It may bo of interest to know how
the name was given to the town. It
seems that when the first settlers ar
rived in Arizona, they came to this
spot on a bright, beautiful Fourth of
July. The only way they could show
their appreciation of the day was to
hoist the Stars and Stripes. They had
one flag but no pole, so finally one in
genious Yankee proposed using a tall
pine tree near by, stripping it of its
branches; which proposal was imme
diately adopted and carried out. From
this the spot was named Flagstaff,
and when the town grew up the name
was kept
This town is one of the most pros
perous little cities in the west, with
a population of 3200 people. Cattle
and lumber are the principal indus
tries, three large lumber mills being
operated here. Though located at an
elevation of 7C00 feet, fine wheat, oats
and potatoes are raised here.
The San Francisco Peaks are snow
clad the year round and furnish the
city's wntcr supply, which is the best
in Arizona.
Flagstaff is nlso the possessor of
one of the finest observatories in the
world, namely, the Lowell Observa
tory. It was from here that Halley's
Comet was first reported on its reap
pearance several years ago. Here also
is located the State Normal school,
which is open the year round, and
next to the Tucson University ranks
as the best school in Arizona.
Scenic beauty surrounds Flagstaff
and is varied and extensive. From
here one takes short trips to the
Painted Desert, the Grand Canyon of
the Colorado, Sunset Mountain, the
recently exploited Natural Bridge of
Arizona, Lava Beds, Moqui Villages,
Ancient Cliff Dwellings, and last but
not least, the San Francisco Peaks.
All of these places can be made by
auto, and the best of roads are here
at the disposal of the tourists who
care to enjoy this mode of travel.
The citizens of Flagstaff arc a
whole-souled, open-hearted lot, and
everything possible is done for the
stranger so that he may enjoy a
pleasant nnd profitable visit. Yava

New Union Oil Manager
Earl Brewster, manager of the
Union Oil Company's plant here has
been transferred to Kingman at an
increased salary to take care of the
growing oil business that has been
booming on account of the mining in
dustry. He expects to take charge of
his new work by March 1st.,,
F. W. Smith, the Lightning Deli
very man, has been engaged by the
company to take the place of Mr.
Brewster.
Have You Seen It? -We
have no recollection of a more
inviting musical program than that of
the soloists of the Schubert Symphony
Club of Chicago, which is to appear
here on March 6, at the Majestic
iheatre, having been offered our read
ers. Look over their program care
fully and you will agree with us that
it is much too inviting to miss attend
ing. MAKES HARD FIGHT TO
GET FA.MILY TO SAFETY
A postal card from Ranger
Jesse Bushnell, who was on his
way to Sedona with his family
during the storms would indicate
that he had a strenous time in
reaching his home station. He
says: "I suppose you heard of
my family and I being snowed in
at the Munds Park range station.
We started from Flagstaff on
December 29th at noon; it was
snowing hard with one foot of
old snow on the ground at Munds
Park. I stopped at the station
over night and the next morning
the snow was so deep that I
could not move the buggy. On
Dec. 31st I made a trail to Loy's
ranch, the snow coming up to the
backs of the horses and that
night I got my family there. I
then began to make a trail to the
rim through five feet of snow,
and in some places more. When
the trail was made I put the
buggy on runners and hitched the
horses tandem to the end of the
pole. It took us fifteen days to
get to .Sedona. The horses' feet
were bleeding at every step."
STAIE SANITARY BOARD'S .
REPORT ON STOCK FOR 1915
According to a report issued by
Sam Bradner, secretary of the state
live stock sanitary board, there were
264,981 head of cattle shipped out of
Arizona during the twelve months of
1915. The number of cattle shipped to
different points within the state dur
ing the samo time was 91,491. Dur
ing the same period, there were
slaughtered in the state 58,491 head.
Combining the three figures, it will
bo seen that the number of'animuls
handled in a commercial way, so as to
come under the observation of the
live stock department, was something
like half a million, or to be exact,
415,096.
The state board makes a record of
all shipments both into and out of
the state, and also keeps close tab on
nil movements of herds within the
state's borders.
In point of numbers, the movement
of hogs comes second in the report of
the board. During the year just past,
there were 9,429 head of porkers ship
ped to points within the, state, and
5,692 sent to points outside. No re
cord was available of the number
slaughtered in the state.
Although hog raising can be called
one of the important branches of the
live stock game in this state, there
were comparatively few animals sent
from one point within the state to
some other location within the bord
ers, and the report shows that only
3,711 head of horses and mules were
so moved. The., export shipments
amounted to 5,145.
All of the above figures aie to ibe
regarded as being fairly accurate be
cause the board exercises extreme
care in checking up the movements of
all livestock, both incoming and out
going, and it is by this means that any
outbreak of disease or an epidemic of
any sort might easily be traced and
segregated in order to prevent its
spread into the other herds and flocks
of the state.
Mine Directors Meet at Oatman
George Babbitt, Fred Hensing, Wil
liam Roden and Chas. Prochnow went
to Oatman last Friday morning to at
tend a meeting of the directors of the
Amalgamated Gold Mining Company.
They arc all directors and heavy
stockholders in the company.
One of the important questions that
will come up at this meeting, among
other things, is that of raising the
price of the stock. Over one half of
the stock allotted for sale has already
been disposed of and is still being
taken up rapidly .by local investors.
Manager Burns has been working
night and day getting machinery and
equipment on the ground to carry on
the development work and is becoming
more and more enthusiastic daily over
the prospects of the mine.
MAY BUILD .THE NAVAJO
SOUTHERN AT KOLBROOK
H. G. Palmer, a prominent railroad
builder of Chicago, arrived in Hol
brook this morning, and will start to
day upon a tour of inspection of the
proposed route of the Navajo South
ern railroad, which leads into the
mountains south of Holbrook. He will
be accompanied by W. H. Clark, se
cretary of the company, who interest
ed Mr. Palmer's company in the pro
position. The Navajo Southern railroad was
surveyed more than two years ago,
and rights-of-way were secured, the
local people interested being Mr. Clark
and C. E. Perkins, now county engi
neer. Owing to the financial depres
sion that existed at that time, and for
a considerable period afterwards, it
was impossible to get capitalists in
terested. Conditions are now greatly
changed and men with capital are now
hunting investments.
Mr. Palmer's company recently fin
ished a railroad in Illinois, and if he
can be convinced that the proposition
here is a good one, there is a good
prospect that his company will un
dertake the construction of the road.
The new road will tap a vast area
of pine timber and it is estimated that
enough lumber; can be secured to furn
ish good .business for the road 20
years. While it is not known definitely
that the Santa Fe company is backing
the proposition to build the new road,
it is generally believed that the Santa
Fe stands ready to take over and
operate the road when built.
No greater boom could come to
Holbrook than the building of this
road, and Mr. Clark and his associates
will be entitled to great credit should
they succeed in putting through the
enterprise. Holbrook News.
ARRESTED CHARGED WITH
KILLING RANGE CATTLE
Bill Morgan and Hanford Scott
were arrested on the range twenty
five miles north of Williams last week
by Stock Inspeotor Tom Eaknis and
Dep. Sheriff Maurice Smith, charged
with having killed beef on the range
belonging to other parties. They gave
bonds of $1000 before Justice Twitty
for their appearance at a preliminary
hearing held Wednesday at Williams.
Hides of animals killed were found
near their camp and one young calf
was found tied to a tree which was
brought into Williams as a part of the
evidence against the men. County
Attorney C. B. Wilson, Judge Har
rington and Tom Eakins went to Wil
liams Wednesday morning to prose
cute the case.
The two men were placed under
$1000 bonds at the preliminary hear
ing Wednesday before Justice Twitty
awaiting trial in the superior court.
Attorney J. E. Jones appeared for the
defendants.
Kolly-Hunter Wedding
Mr. Louis Kelly was married Mon
day to Miss Rose M. Hunter by Judge
J. A. Harrington. Mr. Kelly is a
younger brother of J. C. Kelly, the
Santa Fe telegrapher-operator and a
successful young rancher. Miss Hunt
er has been employed in Wm. Becson's
wood and coal office the past year and
is a handsome and talented young
lady.
After the wedding ceremony a num
ber of enthusiastic friends made the
neighborhood considerably alive with
their congratulations.
Here, No, Never!
The following clipping Js taken
from the Globe Record and of course
could not apply in Flagstaff:
"Although we camiot vouch for the
truth of the statement, the following
conversation is said t have taken place
between two members of the sheriff's
force:
"Hello, Ed."
"Hello, Bill, where have you been
for the last few days?"
"Workin' on a case."
"A case?"
"Yep. Only got three bottles left."
FIRST ANNUAL INTER
SOCIETY CONTEST
Each year, at the Normal, school
witnesses the introduction of new
features and enterprises, all of which
testifies to the enlargement and
growth of the school. At the begin
ning of the year the school was de
vided into two groups, namely group
number one and group number two,
which later became known respective
ly as the "Adelphian" and "Literati"
literary societies.
On Saturday evening February 26,
1916, at 7 o'clock will occur the first
annual contest between the two above
societies. Much thought and care has
been exercised by each contestant in
preparing their respective numbers,
which are as follows:
Declamation The arena scene from
"Quo Vadis." Sienkiewicz. Miss
Eleanor Roberts.
Declamation "The Boy Orator of
Zepeta City." Miss Mary Coulson.'
Debate: Resolved: That the United
States should increase her merchant
marine by purchase and national own
ership. Affirmative Mr. Prather and
Mr. White. Negative Miss Jordan
and Mr. Coulson
Vocal solo "Loves Old Sweet Song"
Mulloy Miss Blanche Mumford.
Vocal solo "Those Songs My
Mother Used to Sing" Miss Charm

leen Anderson.
Oration "Fusion of Ideals and
Progress" Madeline Brandt.
Extemporaneous talk A subject to
be chosen on the evening of the per
formance, from the six leading topics
in the January or February issue of
the "World's Work" and "Review of
Reviews." Miss Opal Adling, Mr.
Wilford Hamblin.
The general public is cordially in
vited to attend this first annual con
test which promises, in the future, to
become one of the big events of the
school year, one which will be looked
forward to by students and townspeo
ple. Gocrnor Hunt Passes Through
Governor Hunt went through Flag
staff Wednesday morning on his way
back to Phoenix from Winslow where
he spoke at a banquet Tuesday night,
given by the Winslow Chamber of
Commerce. He was met at the train
by a number of prominent people.
Superintendent Walter Runke of
Tuba has sent out notices asking for
bids for cutting) hauling and peeling
300 telephone poles to be delivered at
James Geddings water tank on the
Tuba road. The poles arc to be cut
from the Coconino National forest on
Ideations determined by the Forest
Supervisor.
Bids arc also asked for stringing,
stretching and attaching the wire
from the Little Colorado river bridge
to Greenlaw's mill. It will be one
wire on a mixed pole and tree line.
The approximate length of the line
is forty miles with twenty six poles
to the mile.
Those interested may sec the noti
ces posted in The Sun office and ad
ditional information if desired may
be secured by addressing Supt. Wal
ter Runke Tuba, Ariz.
The line was started last year and
an attempt made to get it through
with the aid of Indians, but the In
dians got tired .of the job after the
line was built as far as the Little
Colorado bridge. No appropriation
had been made at that time for con
struction work though the material
had been furnished.
The telephone line would be of
great benefit to that whole section of
the country, especially so during the
big snow blockade.
Male Mail Clerk Wanted
The Civil Service Commission again
announces that an examination for the
position of clerk, male, in the post
office in Flagstaff will be held on
March 25, 1916. This examination has
already been postponed twice because
of the difficulty in securing a sufficient
number of applicants for the position.
(Persons who meet the requirements

the examination.
Postmaster James L. Byrnes will in
form prospective applicants as to the
duties of the position. Application
blanks and pamphlet of instructions
i to applicants may be obtained from

NORMAL BOYS WOULD
ORBANtZECADET COMPANY
Do you believe in a citizenry
trained and accustomed to arms?
Some of the boys of the Northern
Arizona Normal school hold a belief
similar to the above. They are en
deavoring to make that belief felt in
the form of a cadet corps. To further
their enterprise a lig rally will be
held March 3, at Emerson hall.
Help the boys by your presence at
the rally. Prominent men of the
town, representatives of the bpsiness
world, of the professional world, and
of the political world, will speak.
There will be patriotic music by some
of the best talent in Flagstaff.
The Cadet Corps is a voluntary or
ganization among the boys of the
Northern Arizona Normal school. No
one has to become a member unless
he wishes. It has no affiliations with
any other organization. And the
government, neither state nor federal,
has more authority over it than it
had over the foot-ball team last fall.
The purpose of this organization is
to give each of its members a knowl
edge of military science and the phy
sical training that goes with it; to
give him a proper poise and carriage
so that he will be able to bear himself
as a man and not as a broken down
draft horse; to give him a correct
perspective of a true democracy in
that as the officers and non-commissioned
officers are elected by members
of the corps, each will realize and ap
preciate that while the officials are
members of the corps they also have
invested in them by a special act of
the corps authority which should be
respected.
Rempmber the date, March 3, and
be at the big rally at Emerson hall.
There is no admission. This is not
a money raisjng proposition. All are
welcome. Contributed.
Oatman Amalgamated Looking Good
J. T. Burns, general manager of
the Oatman Amalgamated Gold Mines
Co., came in from the Oatman dig
gins Wednesday. The company's hold
ings have been visited by many expert
mining men during the past month all
of whom expressed very favorable
opinion as to thei value. Mr. Ettien
ne A. Ritter, a noted mining cnginper
of Colorado, will soon make an extens
ive examination' of the property
the company.
Al Larson, one of the three men
hit by a freight train last week Mon
day near Cliffs is able to be out and
around again. Babbick is still in the
Milton hospital and while his death
was expected a number of times since
the acident, he has rallied and there
are still hopes of his recovery. Con
trary to our report last week, his foot
was not amputated and the wounded
member was not as badly injured as
was thought at first.
Larson in speaking of the accident
says: "The three of us were talking
as we walked along the track. As
Henry had been over the track several
times before, I told him to go ahead.
We saw thc.pasenger train coming
and the three of us stepped off 'the
west bound track on to the east bound
track. I was in the middle of the
track when the train struck us, the
other two men were on the outer
edges. The cow-catcher must have
caught me between the legs, in any
event, it threw me clear off the right
of way into the snow. I could hear
things sizzling in my ears as I went
through the air after being struck.
The next thing I can hazily remem-
ber was that I was on my hands and !
knees in the snow calling for Henry,
I did not realize what had happened.
After that things were more or less a
blank, for' I do not remember of go
ing to Cliffs for help that must have
been blind instinct. For three or four
days it was hard getting things
straightened out in my head. The pro
jections on the engine undoubtedly
struck the other two boys in the back,
while the point of the cowcatcher with
a snow plow attached luckily threw
me out of the way. If my foot had
caught in anyWay, I guess a whole
freight train would have run over
me." .
Larson only has a few scabs left on
his face and some badly wrenched
muscles left to remind him of his
narrow escape.

INDIAN SCARES ARE
BECOMING REAL HABIT
The following clipping sent out by
the Associated Press under a Flag
staff date line wolud indicate that
Indian scaies were becoming a fixed
habit with some individual who needs
the money.
"Flagstaff, Feb. 21. Lee Crane, the
Indian agent at Keams Canyon, was
killed last Friday by Indians, accord
ing to unconfirmed reports from Gal
lup. A friendly Indian, who arrived
here from Keams, stated that the Na
vajos,Apaches and Yaquis are going
on the warpath within three months
and that Mexicans would join them."
This daring newspaper enterprise
originated from an unconfirmed re
port of the killing of Agent Crane.
No one seems to know where it origi
nated, unless it came from a garbled
report of the trouble at Tuba. That
the Navajos, Apaches, Yaquis and
Mexicans were all going on the war
path in three months was included in
the story just for good measure.
Telegraphic information says that
there was absolutely nothing to the
report.
Easy to Lie Truthfully
George Nichols, engineer on the. F.
L. M. logging road, struck Herb
Asslein over the eye Saturday with
a hammer, necessitating six stitches
to close the wound. There had been
no bad feelings or previous provoca
tion for the blow. Nichols was not
even arrested for his act. Every word
of this is true, but it needs merely the
additional light on the subject to show
that they were workinc on an engine
when a glance blow of the hammer
struck Asslein over the eye.
i
OR. LOWELL IS GREETED
DY A HOED HOUSE
Sunday was a great day at the
Federated church. In the morning
the pastor preached to a congregation
which crowded the auditorium. In the
evening the main room and parlors'
were both filled. The service was one
in commemoration of George Wash
ington's Birthday. Attorney C. B.
Wilson was the speaker. He delivered
a very taking address. The program
of music was patriotic. Mrs. F. O.
Allen singing with fine emphasis "The
Star Spangled Banner," The choir
and congregation joined in the chorus.
Tom L. Rees acted as chairman. Prof.
O. H. Richardson introduced the
speaker.
On Tncsday erening the 22nd. Dr.
Lowell lectured to an audience that
filled every pew and chair and left a
great many standing in all parts of
the house. The Doctor's subject was
"Immigration versus The United
States." It was eloquent and bold
and bristling with startling facts. The
speaker revealed a soul inspired pa
triotism and showed himself a cham
pion of labor. To say that Dr. Lowell
is eloquent only partly expresses the
truth. He is witty, nolished. cultured
and so pungent that the most preju
diced yield to conviction. A reception
was given the speaker at the close of
the lecture. Dr. Fronskc acted as
chairman and eloquently introduced
the distinguished orator. Both of the
above occasions were under the direc
tion of the Men6 club.
ARRESTED MAN PROVES TO
BE THE WRONG ONE HUNTED
Albert Smith who was arrested near
Phoenix last week and brought to
Flagstaff by Constable Frank Fair
child, was liberated Monday and re
turned to Phoenix. The man Fairchild
has ben loking for" the past five years
used the same name when he went
after him up in the Utah country.
' Frank garnered his jnan at that time
' in a cow camp, but as it was his first
some other part of the country.
P. J. Murphy Now Logging Foreman
P. J. Murphy formerly time keeper
