MILK RIVER '
RISES RAPIDLY
Flood Waters Reach City
Cause Rise of Four Feet.
MISSOURI RIVER IS OPEN
Ice Jam Reported at Wolf ' Point—
Flood Danger Believed Passed
If River Stays Open.
A rise of four feet by the Milk river
at Glasgow Thursday night has
alarmed the residents of the valley,
and while there is no immediate dan
ger of flood, the continued rising of
the river may cause those who live
on the flats to move to higher land.
The continued melting of the snow
and ice in the Milk river valley and
the flood waters from Havre and the
swollen creeks which flow into the
Milk river have caused the rapid rise.
The ice at this point is practically
all out and there is little danger of
an ice jam with the river in its pres
ent condition.
Opinions differ as to the dangers
of a flood. Some claim that the wat
ers will be carried into the Missouri
as fast as they rise, now that the
Missouri is open at the mouth of the
Milk river, while others fear that if
the warm weather and chinook winds
continue, that the water from the
benches will fill the creeks that flow
into the Milk and cause it to over
flow its banks. In making his ob
servations this morning, City Engi
neer Severance thought that the rise
was probably due to the backing up
of the waters from the Missouri there
being very little current, while us
ually the current is very swift with
the coming of the flood waters.
An ice jam is reported in the Mis
souri river at Wolf Point and that
river is reported to be rising rapidly
and this may be partly responsible
for the rise in the riveç at this point.
If the Missouri river can be kept open
and the ice jams broken, the dan
gers of'a flood at Glasgow will be
greatly lessened.
The last few nights have been ex
ceptionally warm and the thaw was
not checked by the customary night
freezes. High water is reported at
Chinook, Harlem and Malta. At Chi
nook the Milk river is over its banks
and many of the stock men who had
hay stacks in the valley, are now run
ning out of feed as they are unable
to get to them. The river at Van
dalia dam is also very high.

BANKS SliOW INCREASE

not be duplicated in any other state
in the union, is shown in a statement
issued recently by Superintendent o£
Banks H. S. Magraw, who prepared
figures to prove that the resources
of 214 state banks and 21 private
banks had increased 26 per cent from
December 31, 1914 to December 31,
1915.
The total resources of banks De
cember 31, 1914, amounted to $60,
969,011.17, while on a corresponding
date in 1915 they had climbed to $77,
867.54.
This remarkable record, which can
Not the least important item
Mr. Magraw's statement is the fact
that overdrafts have decreased 70 per
cent during the same period. About
a year ago Mr. Magraw made an ap
peal to the bankers of Montana urg
ing them to co-operate with him to
reduce, overdrafts' and that they have
loyally assisted him is shown by the
fact that overdrafts have been re
duced from $859,150.27 on December,
1914, to $251,012.66, or a total de
crease of $66,137.61.
The reserve fund in state banks on
December 31, 1914, was 28.6 per cent.
On the corresponding date last year
it was 43.0 per cent. The reserve in
private banks was 26.6 per cent as
compared with 37.7 last year. In the
combined banks the reserve was 28.3
as compared with 39.9 at the close of
last year. The law requires a re
serve of 15 per cent in all banks and
of 25 per cent in reserve banks.
Two other extremely gratifying
items in the statement have to do
with the checking and savings de
posits, both of which have increased
during that period to an enormous de
gree.
In all banks under state control,
the checking deposits at the close of
the year's business in 1914 amounted
to $28,965,234.16, and when the banks
closed their business at the end of
last year they had leaped to $41,941,
118.28, an increase in favor of 1915
of $12,975,884.12. The percentage in
crease was 44.
Savings deposits in 1914 totaled
xiouueu
$15,759,393.37, while on a correspond
ing date last year they were $17,
093,248.39, an increase of $1,333,

TWO PRIMARIES
MUSTBE HELD
State Supreme Court Makes
Ruling in Test Case.
FIRST PRIMARY IN APRIL
Will Nominate Electors and Elect
Delegates to Presidential Conven
tion—Second on August 29.,
Montana will hold two primaries
tMs year. One, April 21 to indicate
presidential preferences, to nominate
presidential electors, and to elect de
legates to the national conventions.
The other August 29, to nominate
state and county tickets.
So ruled the supreme court today
in a decision by Associate Justice Sid
ney Sanner. Here's the nub of it:
"At the time our laws were enacted
the Oregon law consisted of the gen
eral primary law relating to nomi
nations for state and county officers
as amended by a later enactment re
—the whole, however, constituting
one law, the effect of which is to re
quire but one primary election in
delegates to the national conventions
presidential years. Had it been the
intention to so provide in this state,
the Oregon law as a whole would
doubtless have been enacted in one
law. This was not done * * * *
The apparently deliberate separa
tion of the single Oregon law into the
two Montana acts cannot be ignored."
Secretary of State* A. M. Alderson
has estimated that the holding of
these two primaries will cost the tax
payers $100,000.
The matter was brought before the
supreme court on a petition for a writ
of mandamus by William Taylor to
of!™ 1 "!* 1 County Clerk A. J. Duncan, to
place his napie on the ballot at the
I Clark county, to file the petition of
April primary as a candidate for the
Democratic nomination of public ad
ministrator. The decision in full is
as follows:
Mandamus to compel the respond
ent, as county clerk of Lewis and
the relator as candidate for the Dem
ocratic nomination to the office of
public administrator of said county
and to place his name as such candi
date upon the official ballot to be
used at the primary election to be
held on April 21st, 1916. The theory
upon which the relief is sought is that
' n virtue °f the provisions of the laws
passed by the initative at the gener
al election of 1912, relating to prim
ary elections, it is required that in
the years when a president and vice
president of the United States are to
, , , . —
be elected the primary election for
„ , „
all officers—state and county as well:
... ,
to indicate the presidential preference
to nominate presidential electors and
to elect delegates to the national con
, , t fl _
ventions—shall be held on the forty
, , , „ i .
fifth day before the first Monday in
„ , J x . j J
o une. s no ls Py ® exists con
cerning the relator s right to be sub
nutted as such candidate for
tion at such time as may be appropri
« • , , » .1
ate, the question presented is whether
these initiated laws contemplate the
• - — •
holding of one primary
presidential years.
That these laws ire an attempt
by the people to enact in this state
t jj e eenera i features of the primary
, aw of Oregon cannot be open to
... open vu
doubt; and it must likewise be con
ceded that the effort to adapt the
provisions of that law to the legis
'lative and other conditions of this
; state, has been most unskillfully per
; formed. Some things however, are
'obivious. At the time our laws were
; enacted the Oregon law consisted of
j the general primary law relating to
. nominations for state and county of
j f j ces as a mended by a later enact
'ment relating to presidential electors
j and delegates to national conven
j tions—the whole, however, constitut
i n g one law, the effect of which is to
i require but one primary election in
j presidential years. Had it been the
| intention to so provide in
I the Oregon law as a whole
doubtless have been enacted in one
aw - This was not done; instead the
11 people of this state enacted two laws
this state
would
the other providing for an election to
one establishing the primary for nom
inations to state and county offices,
to be held on the seventieth day pre
ceding the biennial general elections,
be held on the forty-fifth day before
the first Monday in June in presi
dential years, for the selection of de
legates to the national party conven
tions and for the nomination of presi
dential electors.
It is quite true the
latter act contains the phrase, "the
primary nominating election shall be
held, etc.," but it cannot be supposed
that this phrase has reference to any
other election than the one therein
prescribed. The apparently deliber
ate separation of the single Oregon
law into the two Montana acts can
not be ignored.
Again, the title to the act last re
ferred to is significant. While we are
not required to hold that a law pas
sed by the pâople upon the initiative
is subject in all respects to the.con
stitutional provisions and restrictions
touching the title to acts passed by
the legislative assembly, yet the title
may be fairly accepted as notice to
the people of the general contents
; a presented for their accept
ance or rejection, and as some indica
tion of their intent in passing it. Now
the title in question contains no in
timation that state and county nomi
nations are involved in the act, but
expressly shows that its purpose is to
"provide for the expression by the
people of the state of their prefer
ence for party candidates for presi
dent alK ' v ' ce president of the United
States, the election of delegates to
presidential conventions and the nom
ination of presidential electors."
The relator invokes the rule which
requires us to avoid a construction
leading to absurdity or mischief, and
asserts that the duplication of pri
maries is both of these. Whether this
is so depends «omewhat on the point
of view, and we are not prepared to
say that no sound reason whatever
can be assigned for the separation
of the two events. These considéra
tions have to do, therefore, not withji
the construction or validity of the law.
relating to presidential primaries, but
with its wisdom, and of that this
court is not the arbiter. If, as ap
pears here it was the apparent inten
tion of the people for reasons satis
j factory to themselves, to segregate,
the primary election for presidential
preference from that for state and
county offices, we know of no legal
obstacle to the accomplishment of
that, attention. We see nothing in the
provisions of the presidential primary
law, either within itself or in colla
tion with other statutory provisions
to warrant any other construction,
and we are satisfied that the county)
clerk of Lewis and Clark county is
under no legal duty to submit the re
lator s candidacy at the primary elec-,
tion in April.
The motion to quash is therefore
sustained and the proceedings dis
missed.

Definite plans are now being made

the Commercial club appeared before
that body and took up the matter

position of getting a local organiza

TELLS OF "WILD" WEST.
It's an old saying, "Go away from
home to get the news." And to noth
j n g or no place does it apply more
| strongly than to Montana. Herewith
( are the startling headlines on a
column-wide article in the Republi
can of Birmingham, N. Y., of date
February 12.
"On with the dance. Man shot
by wife's admirer in Montana,
dancers won't stop, and authorities
j öf two counties can't decide which
jurisdiction.
And here is the article from
Birmingham Republican:
| "Whether Bret Harte wrote before
his time or all that is wild and woolly
is not confined to tho movies; that's
the conclusion to which Frederick
W. Welsh has come after reading
letter from an old friend, Oscar
Underwood of Hancock, who is well
known in Binghampton. Underwood,
t now jives in Malta, Montana,
j Acre's the story substantially as
writes it:
"In the beautiful little village
Cow Creek, 40 miles from Malta,
proprietor of a bearding house
shot by an admirer of his wife at
town dance. They stopped the dance
_
side and started dancing again.
"In the meantime the authorities of
Blaine county swooped down upon the
town hall, but refused to act on the
ground that the hall was situated in
Phillips county. Then came the sher
iff of Phillips county, who arrested
all of the 34 dancers and sent for sur
veyors to run the boundary line be
tween the two counties and find out
who was responsible.
"For four days and nights the sur
veyors worked. For four days and
nights the dance continued. The sher
iff danced with the woman over
whom the murder had been done. The
woman danced with the man who had
killed her husband. A steer was
killed and there was plenty to eat.
Folks took turns at sleeping on the
floor.
"In the meantime the fiddlers grew
tired and the body of the murdered
in an outhouse froze stiff. But every
body had a good time. At the end of
the fourth day the surveyors an
nounced that the hall was right
square on top of the county line and
that they didn't know where the mur
der happened.
"The Blaine County Leader printed
this editorial comment: 'Neither Phil
lips nor Blaine county want a murder
trial. The shooter doesn't want to be
tried at all; and the shotee doesn't
care a whoop about the matter. So
why all the fuss?'
"Said the Malta Star of the funeral :
" 'The body of Bud Secrest, the vic
tim of the shooting affair out on Cow
Creek in Blaine county, was buried in
the Malta cemetery Wednesday morn
ing. There were no funeral services
of any kind held, none of the rela
tives of the deceased being present.
Four men, under the direction of
Coroner Tucker, took the body to the
cemetery, where it was interred with
out further ceremony.' "
And thus grows the fame of the
Treasure state.
