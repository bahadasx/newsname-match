VOLUME XIV.
A number have spoken to us
about a graded gravel road with
toll gates from Selmer to Adams
ville. Jt would be a self-sustaining
proposition. The gravel road
from Pittsburg Landing, we are
informed, is a paying concern.
Whether it paid or not, a good
road from these points is the most
most important one in the coun
The democratic party will have
only one candidate for president,
Woodrow Wilson. He is the log
ical candidate, notwithstanding
their platform opposed a second
term. The republican candidate
ha3 not been named with any as
surance. ' That there will be sev
eral candidates before the con
vention is certain. ..There seems
to be a sentimeht in Tennessee
especially to have Roosevelt. It
is possible that the convention
will nominate him. If all parties
can be centered on any one man,
be it any one of the candidates
suggested, there will be no frict
ion. Otherwise there may be.
But it seems all ' republicans are
inclined to not repeat the fatal
mistake of 1912.
Beginning February 29 and go
ing on five days at Jackson, will
be held a conference for good
roads officials and citizens gener-1
ally. On the program are men
who know every feature of road j
building. These conferences have '
already been held in East and
Middle Tennessee.'. This , takes
West Tennessee where the build
ing of roads vary from that of
the other divisions of" the state.
The State Highway Department
and the University of Tennessee
are the sponsors for these meet
ings. There will be no costs or
contributions made at the meet
ings, 'arid, the railroads have giv
ea reduced rates. We .trust our
- road officials will attend, as they
?are the people who are specially
. intended to be reached as well as
any others.

i k - LETTER
Editor Independent r 4 . v
It was my fortune, while living in
Washington, to see six men who had
been, or . were, presidents . of the
United States. The first was Ruther
ford B. Haye. In 1892 he marched
along Pennsylvania at the Grand Ar
my reunion, and I saw his tall, lean
figure and his pale face and long beard
in the procession. Soon after that
he died. Then I saw Pesident Har-
risson at the White Honse; a short,
compactly built, broad-shouldered
nan, with bright eyes and a fresh,
rosy complexion. I saw Grover Cleve
land and heard his gruff voice several
times. He was "gritter-faced," as
we used to say; had rugged features,
and there was an iron firmness about
him. History will accord him a high
piace" as a uFoau-nmiaeav patriotic
American. I heard William McKinley
deliver his, last inaugural address
while I was squeezed in such a crowd
in front of the capitol that my feet
scarcely, touched the ground. The
martyred president was short and in
clined to be stout, had a dark com
plexion, and a thin, , but clear and
pleasant voice. I last beheld him as
his mortal remains lay in state in the
rotunda of the capitel, while a steady
stream of his loving countrymen paid
him the silent ' tribute of respect.
That marble brow and noble face - re
minded one of the picture 'of Daniel
Webster, and was of the true Ameri
can statesman type But one cheek
and the side of his neck were already
blackened with approaching decompo
sition, and the sad services were hur
ried through.
The man who followed hira as pres
ident is perhaps the most remarkable
man ever born . on this continent.
There will not be room here to say
much about Theodore Roosevelt, al
though I could say much that is
interesting. At close view, he looked
sort of sandy-hoired, grirmine and
snappy; has a thin, harsh voice and
quick movements, and his teeth are
certainly in evidence when he talks,

House have told me much 'about' hia
kindness to them, and his wonderful
memory of their individual family mat
ters and their needs. , Some day I may
find time to tell some intimate stories
about this great man, as told me. by
people who know him best. '
In June, 1911, there Was held at
Baltimore a celebration of the fiftieth
anniversary of the elevation of Cardi
nal Gibbons to the priesthood. Near
ly twenty thousand people gathered
in the Armors to see and hear one of
the most distinguished groups of men
that ever gathered on this continent.
I never expect to see anything like it
again. The -Catholic cardinal, thin
and bent, but proudly smiling, was in
the center; President Taft and former
President Roosevelt sat together on
the platform in front; Vice-President
Sherman, Speaker Champ Clark, for
mer Speaker Joe Cannon, Chief Jus
tice White of the Supreme Court of
the United States and several of his
associates, members of the Senate and
House, the Governor of Maryland,
Mayor of Baltimore, and Charles J,
Bonaparte, a great grand nephew of
Napoleon, were among the . brilliant
throng. Also, there was the British
Ambassador, James Bryce, and other
diplomats.
Although Taft and Roosevelt sat
side by side (perhaps for the last
time), they did not face each other
while talking. It was comical to see
the whites of "their eyes while they
turned their heads on the chair-back
and looked at each other across their
noses. Occasionly one of them would
laugh, but mostly they were serious.
I heard their speeches. Taft had a
voice like a silver bell, that could be
heard all over that immense gather
ing, and his words came out so slowly
and distinctly that they could almost
be written down in long-hand. Then
came Roosevelt. He had a thin,
cracked sort of a voice, quick ges
tures and, to me, rather tiresome
style, and his talk was long, ' Perhaps
the best address was that of "Sunny
Jim" Sherman, Vice-President of the
United States. Although the speech
was brief, it was beautiful- Jpe Can-

aon stepped forward with a sheet of
paper from which he read a short
speech, rather dry. ' Then, tossing the
paper to one side, he said: "Now I am
going to talk.".- And I am : here to
say it was a great talk. He said,
among other things: 'There are per
haps twenty, thousand, people here
today. No two of them have the
same idea of what God is.. My God
it not the same as yours;. I cannot de
scribe Him to you, and you cannot
tell me what He seems to you to be.
And yet we all feel that He does ex
ist, and is as much yours as mine."
Champ Clark has a big round, full
voice, and a straight, pleasing way of
expressing himself. He made an
amusing blunder by appealing to his
hearers, "both Catholics and Republi
cans," about something, which made
the audience gasp, but he caught him
self and turned it off neatly. Champ
is a big man in our national life, and
has grown in mental stature with his
various promotions. " 'V "'V.
After the speaking was over, and
the speakers had moved off to chat
with each other, the crowd set up a
howl for Roosevelt, and the cries of
"Ah there, Teddy 1" attested the affec
tion still felt for him by thousands of
admirers. Roosevelt, perhaps un
consciously, posed in the very center
of the big stage, a light black coat
like tho toga of a Roman senator
thrown over one arm, his face turned
sideways and a diabolical grin (it can
be described in no other way) reach
ing from the corner of his mouth to
one eye. . I never saw anything like1
it. His big, bull-neck upholding that
heavy, square-looking head, gleaming
glasses in their gold frames, the bold,
almost insolent bearing of the man
all it unmeant, I knew made a picture
I shall never forget. And all the
while hia admirers, who almost wor
shipped him, yelling at his feet, but
he said nothing;, scarcely making a
sign in recognition of the demonstra
tion, except that perfectly indescrib
able grin, and maybe a little jerky
nod of the head once in awhile. I
never believed the many uncharitable
tales told in the papers of Roosevelt's
ambition to be emperor of the western
world, but he1 cartainly would look the
part if such authority came to him.
No face, even that of Lucifer (who
ever that worthy may be, but we have
all heard of him) or of any earthly
potentate, ever looked more contemp-
tously proud than T. R. did on that
June day in Baltimore, looking dowu
at the cheering crowds below him.
He is still one year younger than
President Wilson, and no one, perhaps
least of all himself, can tell what

politics.; He has queered himself with

OWN YOUR CROP
INSTEAD OF OWE IT
Food And Grain Crop Will Make
Agricultural South Independent,
Says H. Q. Hastlnga
Atlanta, Ga.(Speclal.) The cred
it system under which the agrlcultu
ral south works and stays poor Is an
alyzed ia a striking way by H. O
Hastings of Atlanta, chairman of the
agricultural committee of the Cham
ber of Commerce, and a member of
the executive council of the South
eastern Fair. He does ' not mince
words in talking about the situation.
"Every season during the last fifty
years, he says, "there has been trou
ble in the cotton belt whenever the
crop was large and the price low, or
the, crop short. Each time the cry of
hard times goes up, and the reason
back of it is that the farmers cannot
get enough money to pay their debts
out of their so-called cash crop cot
ton. It is disheartening because it la
so absolutely unnecessary.
"A cotton farmer's debts are large
ly for food and grain, charged up
CR'.inst him ort the merchants' books
r two to three times the price that
: ,,-! same items could be-, produced
oa his own acres, and usually without
ttoHnija ivUprf AranCA1 with a Crsp Of Set
tun as large as he now makes. -
"The trouble is that most cotton
farmers owe their crop instead of
owning it when made. ,
"The credit way looks the easy
way, but it strangles most farmers
before they get through life.
"I have said repeatedly in public
addrosses.that.no state or section of
any ' country can be prosperous that
is regularly dependent on . another
section for its food supplies. . What
is true of a state or section la true
of the individual farmer.
. ' "The1 great exhibits of grain, hay
and food, products ehown at the South'
eastern Fair held in Atlanta in No
vember, give , the lie to the statement
that these things cannot be grown
here at home successfully and prof
itably. ....... '
"A good big borne garden kept
planted and rightly . tended through
the season will produce half of the
living besides furnishing an abund
ance for canning or drying from the
surplus. '
"When we make our food and grain
we will' have few or no debts at the
store; 1 we will own instead of owe
our ' crops when made, and farm
wealth will accumulate in the south
Instead of farm and crop mortgages.
