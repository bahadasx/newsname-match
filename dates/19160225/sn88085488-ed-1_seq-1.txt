VOLUME XXVIII
UNION AND GRANGE
WORKING TOGETHER
National Legislative Commit of
j Farmers' Organizations Held
Busy Session at National
Capital
L. C. Crow returned last Friday
from Washington, D. C, where he
attended a meeting of the national
executive board of the Farmers
Union. He reports an Interesting
session, which he briefly summarizes
as follows:
"The national legislative commit
tee met February 7 at the National
hotel. All members of the national
executive board were present, also .1.
J. Brown, president of the Georgia
division, J. Q. Alexander, president
of the North Carolina division;
Walter Smith, president of the Indi
ana Division, Mr. Pope, president of
the Texas division; Mr. Gustafsen,
president of the Nebraska division,
and J. V. McCall, president of the
Washington and Idaho division.
"A joint session of Farmers Union
members and National and State
Grange members was held on Tues
day, February 8. At this joint ses
sion O. F. Dornblazer, member of
the executive board from Texas, was
appointed by the chair to represent
the National Union in joint session
with Grange members before the
house military committee and explain
the attitude of the National Union on
preparedness. Bro. Dornblazer did
this very acceptably to all members
of the Grange, acquitting himself in
a creditable manner by reading and
commenting favorably on the report
of the legislative committee adopted
by the National Union at Lincoln,
Nebr. This report gives the attitude
of the National Union on prepared
ness and can be procured by any
member sending to the national sec
retary for the proceedings of the last
national convention. It declared for
a reasonable outlay for coast defense
and a small standing army of re
serves and an efficient state militia.
Incidentally, while this joint commit
tee was appearing before the con
gressional military committee of con
gress, General Nelson A. Miles made
his appearance and in his statement
asserted that no nation could invade
our shores at the present time, citing
the fact that Great Britain could not
take the Dardanelles, although she
has the strongest navy in the world,
owing to its coast defenses.
"The joint session of the Grange
and Union agreed that direct govern-'
ment aid in a rural credit measure is
the only remedy to stop the ever in
creasing tenantry, and which would
be satisfactory to the farmers of the
United States, who really need
help. The measure now pending, i<»
was decided, does not reach the ten
ants, is too cumbersome and compli
cated, and would be of little, if any,
Practical benefit to the farming com
munity, but would probably satisfy
the commercial and banking inter
ests, it having been framed by a
banking committee. Several con
gressmen and senators attended our
meetings and all agreed that the pro
posed bill i 8 not what we want, but
is probably the best we can get, with
some amendments they will try to
get congress to agree to. Several
damaging provisions have, already
been stricken out and the senators
Promised they would try to further
amend it in the senate, but the opin
ion of our committee was that it will
Prove almost worthless and will be
almost ad-ad letter. ,
'The national marketing commis
sion was endorsed by the joint com
mittee and is now pending in con
fess, but the prospect is rather
gloomy for an Independent proposi
°n, as it now looks to be the plan
o further increase and magnify the
agricultural department at Washing
°n by placing it under the bureau
01 markets. j UBt what the final out
come will be Is very difficult to pre
oict. but we are all agreed that if it
fIT^ DU t0 anythin* that will bene
the farmer in marketing his pro
uc t«, it should be passed as a" in
dependent proposition and not be
.nan d . ed by the agricultural depart
me °t.
.Ope thing was quite clear to the
£L m,ttee ana that was that If the
■£*«■ ever gets his own he must
261 an not only organize, but

must co-operate in a way that will I
bring results, by putting men in con- j
gress who will give him a square;

DEAN ELTON FULMER KILLED
IN RAILROAD WRECK SUNDAY
Head of State College Chemistry Department,
with Four Others, Meets Tragic Death
when Trains Crash at Cheney—Had
Given Valuable Services to State.
Prof. Henry Elton Fulmer, dean
of the faculty and head of the chem
istry department of the State College
of Washington, was killed in a rear
end collision on the S. V. & S. line at
South Cheney, early Sunday morn
ing. He was on his way home from
Walla Walla, where he had been
called to give expert evidence in a
case involving the alleged adultera
tion of a quantity of vinegar which
had been confiseated__by the state de
partment of agriculture. He took a
berth in the X. P. sleeper from Walla
Walla, which at Pasco was attached
to Burlington train No. 42. This
and all other Northern Pacific trains
were being run over the S. P. & S.
tracks between Pasco and Marshall
junction, on account of washouts on
the N. P. line. The Walla Walla
sleeper was at the rear of the regu
lar train, but back of it was an empty
chair car. While No. 42 was stop
ping at South Cheney the North j
Coast Limited dashed into the real
end, telescoping the empty chair car
into the Walla Walla sleeper. Five
passengers were killed and a num
ber seriously injured.
The first news of the wreck
reached Pullman from Virgil .Mc-
Croskey of Colfax, who phoned his
niece, Miss Aline Browder, that he'
had received a message that Prof.
Fulmer had been killed. It was after
2:00 o'clock before the rumor could
be confirmed, when Agent Laird of
the N. P. received a list of the dead
from the operator at Marshall. Prof.;
Fulmer's family had no inkling of
the disaster when the sad news was
conveyed to R. E. Doty, who broke
it to his wife, the daughter of Prof.
Fulmer, and she in turn told Mrs!
Fulmer.
As soon as President Holland was
notified he sent Prof. Waller to Spo
kane to make arrangements to bring
the body to Pullman. The remains !
arrived Monday evening and were at I
once taken to Kimball's undertaking
parlors.
In the clothing of deceased was
found a Travelers' Insurance policy
for $5,000, which he had purchased \
on leaving Walla Walla. In addi
tion to this it is reported that he |
carried about $15,000 life Insurance
which, with his residence property i
and some bank stock, will leave his
family in comfortable circumstances,
to say nothing of the presumably j
heavy damages which the railroad
will have to pay.
Clair Fulmer arrived from Seattle I
Tuesday noon and expects to remain
here for the present. Rev. Clark
Fulmer, a brother of deceased, ar-!
rived Tuesday evening from Port
Angeles. The funeral service was
held in the M. E. church Wednes- \
day afternoon at 2 o'clock. Every
seat in the large auditorium was
occupied and scores-stood during the
simple but impressive ceremony.
The rostrum and pulpit were a!
solid bank of flowers, which Includ
ed many beautiful wreaths and set
pieces.. Professors Waller, Shedd,:
Egge, McCully, Carpenter and Todd
DEAN ELTON FULMER
acted as pall bearers and were fol
lowed by the members of the be
reaved family and relatives of the
deceased. Back of the pews reserv
ed for mourners were seated the
members of the- faculty of the chem
istry department. Regent .1. C.
Cunningham President Holland and
Dr. E. A. Bryan occupied seats
together across the aisle from
the mourners. After a selec
tion by the choir Rev. J. W.
Caughlan read passages from the
scriptures and offered an earnest
prayer.
Mrs. W. li. Strong sang "One
Sweetly Solemn Thought" with rare
feeling and expression after which
Rev. Caughlan in simple but eloquent
words paid a beautiful tribute to his
departed friend and'parishioner. Of
the many admirable traits in the
character of the departed, and which
are worthy of being remembered, the
speaker emphasised three, his sim-
plicity,integrity ami religious loyalty.
His voice trembling with emotion, he
painted .the quiet, unassuming, kind
ly and helpful life of Prof. Fulmer,
and closed the impressive service by
invoking divine' strength and consol
ation for the' sorrowing wife and
children.
The remains were interred in the
South Side cemetery in the presence
of a large- concourse of friends.
All business houses as well as the
college and high school closed during
'lie funeral.
Prof. Henry Elton Fulmer WM
horn February 6, 1864, at Marcellus.
N. Y. f being 52 years and 14 days of
age at the time of his death. He was
the son of David Morgan Fulmer
and Ellen Elizabeth (Longstreet)
Fulmer, and on Christmas day, 1889,
he was united in marriage to Helen
Barbara Aughey of Lincoln, Neb
raska, who, with four children, sur
vives him. Of the children, one son,
Clair, is in the electrical business at
Bremerton, and another son, Jervis,
is a student, in the Pullman high
school. One of the two daughters
is Mrs. R. E. Doty of Pullman, form
erly Muriel Fuliinr, while an eight
year-old daughter, Jean, is a student
in the Pullman schools. His mother
Mrs. Ellen Fulmer, is still living, and
resides at the present time with Mr.
Fulmar's sister, Mrs. R. W. Thatch
er, 1405 Cholmsford street, St. Paul,
Minn. One brother, the Rev. Clark
Fulmer, resides at Port Angeles.
Prof. Fullmer graduated from the
University of Nebraska In 1887, tak
ing a B. S. degree, and two years
later was granted a Master's degree
from the same institution. He was
in the assay business in Arkansas in
1887-88. and in 1889 was elected to
an instructorship in chemistry and
assaying in the University of Ne
braska. During 1890 Prof. Fulmer
also served as chief chemist in the
Grand Island beet sugar factory.
While at the University of Nebraska
ho prepared a valuable treatise on
"The Artesian Waters of Lincoln,
Nebraska," and another on "The Oc
[currence of Phosphates of Ne
braska."
, In ISO- Prof, Fulmer accepted the
I chair of chemistry at Washington
State College, and served as head of
; (hat. department until I he' time of
■ his death. In c.'un he was honored
• by election as dean of lh« college,
and was named state chemist in
1900, holding both positions until his
death. He was a member of the
American Chemical society and the
se" let, of Chemical Industry, and
while at Nebraska was aCiliated with
the Phi Delta Theta fraternity. For
several years Prof. Fulmer served as
a member of the national pure food
commission, under Dr. H. W, Wiley.
This honor was a signal one, the
Pullman man being the only member
of that, important commission from
west of tin- Mississippi river.
Dean Fulmer and Prof. O. 1.. Wal
ler enjoyed seniority among the'
present faculty at W. S. ('., both as
suming their duties here in 1893.
As a food chemist Prof. Fulmer
ranked with the best In the United
Slates, and was considered an au
thority in this line. As state chem
ist he was called upon to analyze
thousands of samples of canned and
bottled goods, suspected of adultera
tion or unlawful content. It was
business of this nature that took him
to Walla Walla last Friday. He
was also an authority on poisons,
and em many occasions he was called
upon to analyze the contents of the
Stomachs of deceased persons, where
poison was suspected, and to appear
as an expert witness in court.
As a member of the State College
faculty and the experiment station
staff he gave invaluable services to
the people of the state. Hnuareds of
irraduates and students who had
classes under Dean Fulmer held him
up a:; a model instructor, possessed
of unlimited knowledge of his sub
ject and the somewhat rare faculty
of being able to impart that knowl
edge to others iii an understandable,
concise manner. Especially valuable
to the students were his lectures on
chemistry, always clear and under
standable] and delivered in such a

TWO PULLMAN PEOPLE
HAVE NARROW ESCAPE
Leonard llegnauer and Mis. .lames
G. Dickson Were Passengers on
Dilated Train
Leonard llegnauer, with the ex
tension department of the college,
was a passenger on Burlington No.
42, in the wreck in which Prof. Elton
Fulmer, Lee M. Conry, traveling
freight agent of the Northern Pa
cific; I. J. Minnick, state oil in
spector; John J. White of Spokane,
and B. L. Berkey of Portland, Ore.,
lost their lives. He was in the coach
immediately ahead of Walla Walla
sleeper Crookston, in which all the
fatalities occurred, but was eating
breakfast at the time of the accident.
"We had stopped but a short time,
I would say about five minutes, be
fore I heard another train whistle,"
he said. "Something about the
whistle attracted my attention; next
there was a dull hud and then glass
started flying. Windows were
cracked, water and china was scut
tered everywhere and a cream pitch
er fell Into my lap."
Mr. Hegnauer learned, only after
arriving In Spokane, that Prof, Ful
mer was among the dead, though the
two have been friends for 10 years.
"I may have assisted In carrying
Dr. Fulmer from the wreck," said
Mr. llegnauer. "On account of the
fog and the dirt from the wreckage
there was little attempt at the time
at identification."
Mrs, James G. Dickson was turn
ing from North Yakima, where she
had been visiting her parents. She
took a berth in Hi" CrookstOO at
Pasco, but got up early In the morn
ing as she Intended to catch the train
for Pullman at Marshall junction.
She walked forward to the chair ear
but had not taken a seat when the
crash came and she v/as thrown vio
lently against one of the chairs and
severely bruised. Had she remained
iv the sleeper a few moments longer
she would probably have been
killed.
NUMBER 19
BOTTOM DROPS FROM
CHICAGO MARKETS
Local (.mill Prices Demoralized a_
Ue.sult of Big Eastern Slump-
Led Wheal Down to 80 Cents
The Pullman wheat market was
demoralized yesterday as a result of
sensational drops on the Chicago ex
change, Yesterday's tumble In the
big eastern exchange was the great
est of the season, wheat closing
seven cents under the opening quo
tations, according to reports re
ceived over the wire by William
Chambers. As a result of the decline
nearly all the local buyers were en
tirely out of the market, the nominal
quotations being pretty much of a
guess. Local grain men can not ac
count for the big drop, and will ven
ture no guess upon the future' prob
abilities of the- cereal markets.
Yesterday's quotations here, pure
ly nominal, were us follows:
Red Russian wheat 80c
('lull wheat 82c
Cony fold wheat 83c
Hail, > . per cwt $ 1.25
Oats, per cwt $1,05
It is doubtful if even these prices
could have been secured had the
farmers showed an inclination to
sell.
Several Pullman men who were
holding wheat on the Chicago ex
change closed their deals rather than
produce the heavy margins required.
HA YVES WINS (ASK
I.N SUPERIOR COURT
Suit Drought by A. H. Laney, Who
Asked $25,000 for Alleged Alien
ation of Wife's Affections,
Decided for Defendant
After deliberating nine hours, the
Jury in the Laney-Haynes case, In
which Albert Laney asked $25,000
damages, claiming that D. M. Haynes
had alienated the affections of Mrs.
Laney, brought in a verdict for the
defendant, and the second trial of a
mooted case was ended. D. C. Dow
of Pullman, attorney for Mr. Laney,
at once filed a motion for a new trial,
assuming that the jury had mis
understood the Instructions of the
judge on an Important point. In the
re-print from the Colfax Palouser,
which was made a part of The Her
ald story last week, an error was
made in the statement that Mr.
Haynes had secured a divorce from
his wife. The decree was granted to
Mrs. Haynes on January 13, 1914,
and The Herald is glad to make the
correction.
Judge Mcintosh, before whom the
ease was tried, has overruled the
motion for a new trial.
