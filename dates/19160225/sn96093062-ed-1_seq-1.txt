OIL FEVER OYER
ALL THE STATE
Hryan 'County, Among Others, Is a
Prospective- Scene of Activities.
Hundreds of Leases. Are Being
Taken All Over this Section
With the price of crudo oil soaring
and tho supply falling off, thoro is
every Incentive in Oklahoma to ex
plore for oil. Every section or Ok
lahoma that has not heretofore been
thoroughly explored is now tho ex
cited scone either of rlvnlry for oil
leases or cooperation among owners
of lands to secure some oxploror to
drill by prosontlng him with a bun
dlo of leases on 10,000 or 20,000
acres.
In a doztm communities In Bryan
"" , . .V V , V, . ,!
coal oil a mile below the surface. It
is a prospect. Antlclinos nre numer
ous in Oklnhoma. It is Just one anti
cline, after another. So the explora
tion Tor oil 1b one of tho most Inex
haustible and fascinating forms of
taking n chance.
It used to be that a territory was
condemned when a dry holo was
made within a radius of five or ten
mllos. Now it is known that such a
radiuB may contain both dry holes
and 10,000-barrel wells.
There is a series of anticlines ex
tending across Oklahoma from Black
well on the Kansas side to Tillman
County on the Texas line. Tho the
ory of oil men is that fields will bo
found all across Oklahoma on this
lino between Blackwell and Electra.
There are how scouts all along this
route securing leases. In some cases
tio leases are secured for nothing. In
others tho cost is as high as a dollar
an acre. Unless near production tho
latter price is unusual and is reached
only" because a number of -geologists
have reached the same favorable con
clusion without knowledge of' the 'in
vestigation's made by each ' other.
Some of the thore successful and en
terprising companies are hiring as
many as five geologists to make dis
tinct and confidential examinations
and reports on the samo amas, If
the geologists all roach the same-con
clusion as to a property, there is like
ly to be spirited bidding for tho leas
es providing tho owner does not
lease to tho owner making the first"
offer.
Tho production of petroleum prob
ably Is, in the main, in the hands of
the largo companies, many of them
having more or less direct affiliation
with tho Standard Oil Company, but
tho exploration and initial work in
the oil fields Is generally done by men
who havo nelhtro much money nor
influence. It ia the fascination of
tho bamlble that crsults in exploration
for oil.
Tho present advance in price for oil
Is a stimulus to tho explorer. A well
that produces 10,000 barrels of oil a
day when oil is worth $1.50 a barrel
will soon pay for a co3t of $25,000.
Thore are such wells. There is an
ever-present possibility that the next
well drilled will bo such a weij. Two
years ago a well was drilled in the
northeast corner of the old Gushing
or promised to become a factor In the
making of oil history. It was recent
ly drilled deeper as a sort of experi
ment. In the Tucker isand it struck
a reservoir that yielded 800 b.irrels
an hour. It was for a tlmo'tho big
gest well ever drilled In Oklahoma.
Thon it got to flowing salt water
and was ruined.
A year ago oil producers were still
attempting to got tho Oklahoma Cor
poration Commission to ittompt en
forcing the Quixotic plan of the Leg
islature to fix prices for oil, so that
thoy could pay their debts and in
terest on their capital. Production
fell off. Tho demand increasod. The
extremity gavo place to a boom that
is now stimulating tho gambling
spirit which will make tho nvamge
quick millionaire by tho ol! route
become again a broken ndventuror,
If ho is not very careful a thing
that oil mon ns a rule are not. But
many 'of them will live longo and
enjoy life bettor If fortune shall turn
against them. Thoy are oatlug too
much and not exercising enough.
Besides, tho markot for automobiles
and diamonds has no buslnsn to be
so Btifr whilo munitions are occu
pying tho spotlight, and with tho
dissipation or theso easy millions to
to drillers will como a posnlble re
adjustment or values in such luxur
ies as many Americans soek to clas
sify as necessary. '

ALL THE VOTERS
MUST REGISTER
The New Election Law lr-v.uinnbl)
vtJU Prevent Nevroes IV.)in of.ini:
In Oklahoma The Pi'lmiirv t.nw
Was Not Changed.
Oklahoma Democrats at the recent
session of tho Legislature adopted a
gonoral registration law and submit
ted an amondment to the Constitu
tion that will presumably irovent
most of tho negroes of the State from
voting In ruture olectioni.
Tho Loglslaturo did not adont nnv
now primary law and mado no chmiBo
lnhe gonoral election law.
The registration law, n it was
agreed upon artor a month 'of secret
caucusing by tho Domocratic mem
ber, was amended tho leas! day of
the sosslon, because it could not puss
with the emergency section to place
it In Immediate effect, as It was
adopted by tho caucus. Several Dem
ocratic members of the House stood
out against tho bill as unfair for the
reason that It loft almost arbitrary
powers in the hands of the precinct
registrars who wore to be mnolntcd
by the county roKlstrars annolnted
by the secretary of tho Senate.
As amended tho law re'iulies the
issuance of registration certificates
to all persons who voted in the No
vember elections of 1914, If they be
still qualified electors of the State.
It provides for an appeal from tho
decision of the precinct registrnr to
the District Court by any elector ag
grieved by the refusal of the regis
trar to Issue a certificate to him.
Under this law It will bo necessary
ror the qualiried voters or tho State
to secure registration certificates
from the registrars of thl'. ievpin'
precincts between the 13th of AdHI
and the 11th day or May this year.
Without theso certiricates it will be
impossible for a voter to participate
In any election In the State In the fu
ture. The law nrovldes In an amend
ment that the qualified voter who
voted ln the November, 1914, election
shall be denied the rlcht to vote with
out a certificate, but it is safer nnd
mor oregular for all persons desiring
to vote in Oklahoma ln the future to
secure certificates rrom the precinct
registrars during ,the .few days be
tween the 13th day or May and the
lltb of April. .
These certiricates will contninaa
minute description or the vot?u. They
will give his occupation, age,, race,
color, politics, co'or or hair, color of
eyes and the names or twi persons
who are able to vouch for him Jn the
electlo nprecinct.
Persons who may be absent from
the county, or sick or otherwise by
reason of misfortune unable lo reg
ister during the period designated,
have another opportunity during the
period between May 10 and June 20,
1916. The precinct registra Is the
sole Judge of tho sufNcIor.cy or the
reason given for this registration.
For the benefit of persons who may
become oualiried electors in Oklaho
ma arter May 10, 1916, the law pro
vides that such persons may make ap
plication to the registrars in the nre-
cincts of which they may be quali
fied voters not more than twenty
nor less than ten days berore the day
or holding an election, and unon com
plying with all the terms and provis
ions of the r.ct may receive registra
tion certlflcites.
The certiricate required by this
law shall be the permanent liconso
or the voter. The law provides that
If a certiricate bo lost, destroyed, or
mutilated, a new certiricate may be
Issued by tho precinct registrar unon
a showing by the voter that he is en
titled to such certificate.
Under the terms or the amend
moms auoptea the last da or the
session, the voters who nartlclnated
in tho' election in November, 1914,
nre entitled to enrollment and regis
tration certiricates, and It is made the
duty or the registrars to lssuo such
certificates.

At this rate, approximately $420.00
will put this fourteen miles of road

Tho crew is draining the road in
a thorough mannoi on bith sides,
piling the dirt to the conter to form

let water run ofr on ono side or the

will stand in tho center of the road.
Arrangements have been made for

of trafric.
Plans are being considered ror the
graveling of ttie road later, but this
ha n6t been definitely decided upon.
MAY SETTLE AHSSISSIPPI
CHOCTAW CLAIM WITH CASH
Owen to Present Restrictions Amend
ment to Appropriation Bill that
Carries Per Capita Pay
ment Item.
Congress may terminate the long
waged fight of tho representatives of
the Mississippi Choctaws for partici
pation in the funds of the Choctaws
of Oklahoma, In making a settlement
ny an appropriation from the Federal
Treasury, aggreable to a suggestion
made before the Senate Committee on
Indian Afrairs. Senator Ashurst
has Indicated to Senator Williams or
Mississippi that such a course might
meet with approval, and Senator
Gronna, a member or the committee,
expressed a similar view. ,
The question arose during consid
eration or the Choctaw and Chicka
saw per capita payment item in the
Indian appropriation bill. The op
position or the Mississippi members
to the per capita Item has always
been seized by the representatives of
claimants to enrollment as a method
to secure reopening of the rolls which
were closed by act of Congress years
ago. While many members of Con
gress believe the Mississippi Choc
taws should be dealt with, they are
opposed to tampering with the citi
zenship rolls.
Action on the per canlta item was
delayed until Monday, owing to the
absence of Senator La Follette, who
has opposed payments to the Indians
find ffivnroil rnnnontnn Mio. rli..
ana Chickasaw rolls
senator uwen will draw an
amendmont for the bill, which would
romovo every competent Indian from
the restricted class. There are 35,
000 restricted Indians In Oklahoma,
nnd the Indian Office reports that
few of them would be subject to the
transfor. Senator Owen said if It
was thought host to retain control of
their property, the Indians ought to
bo given their money.
