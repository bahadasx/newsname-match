UNPAVED STREETS
BEING LEVELLED
CITY HAS MEN AND TEAMS AT
WORK DRAGGING THE STREETS
WHILE DIRT IS IN CONDITION
FOR WORKING
Lumber Prospects Best
in Years, Says Johnson
Taking advantage of the present
condition of the ground, the city has
men and teams employed In dragging
and grading the unpaved streets of
Klamath Falls, As a result, chuck
holes and ruts developed during the
winter months are being eliminated,
and the streets are getting Into good
shape for all kinds of travel.
Osaka is the greatest Japanese toy
unking city. Toklo is next,
Lumbermeu have reason to expect
the most prosperous season In years,
according to Robert A. Johnson, head
of tho Klamath Manufacturing Co.,
who Is here from San Francisco on
business. Mr. and Mrs. Johnson will
leave in a few days for Honulula, and
upon their return, will reside In this
city.
"Thero Is a material increase in the
demand for upper grades of lumber,
and the priecs offered are $5 to $6
per thousand feet better than they
were in tho fall," said Johnson. "In
the past few days, I have received
telegraphlo Inquiries for Ave car
loads, at ) 5 to $ 6 more than was of
fered a few months ago.
"It Is the same all over the coast.
The lumbermen are moat optimistic,
and none are attempting to sell ahead,
and In this way, keeping In position
to get tho top prices, which they do
not believe are reached as yet.
"In tho box lumber, there ts every
reason to look for an over production,
owing to the desire of all mlllmen to
get out as much upper grade lumber1
as possible for eastern shipment.
The demand for box uhooka of
course regulated largely by the fruit,
crop conditions on the coast, but even
if there is no increased demand or
price for box shook, the good demand
for the upper grades will offset
this fact, and mako general coadt
tlona tho best In years." 'J'
