WILSON IN LETTER
President Writes Letter to Senator
Stone Refusing to Surrender
Rights of Citizens.
TO WITHDRAW WOULD BE TO
SURRENDER SELF-RESPECT
Wilson, Clark, Kitchin and Flood in
Conference,^ No Action Taken
by Congress.
Washington, Feb. 25.President
Wilson, at the end of two days of
agitation in congress for action
warning Americans off armed mer
chantmen, wrote a letter last night
to Senator Stone, chairman of the
senate foreign relations committee,
stating that he could not consent to
the abridgement of the rights of Am
erican citizens in any respect.
"The honor and self-respect of the
nation is involved," he said. "We
covet peace and shall preserve it at
any cost, but the loss of honor."
The president expressed hope that
explanations of the declared inten
tion of the central European powers
to sink all armed merchant ships
without warning would put a differ
ent aspect on the situation which now
seemed to present insuperable obsta
cles
"We have had no reason to ques
tion their good faith or fidelity to
their promises in the past," he ad
ded, "and I for one, feel confident that
we shall have none in the future."
Answers Stone's letter.
The letter was in answer to one
written yesterday by Senator Stone,
outlining the situation existing at
the capitol, where since Wednesday
riorning, persistent demands had been
made for some action which might
lessen the possibility of war between
the United States and Germany.
The president's statement was re
peated this morning to Speaker
Clark, Representative Kitchen, ma
jority leader, and Representative
Flood, chairman of the house foreign
affairs committee, who had an en
gagement in order to explain the po
sition in which the house found ~5X?r
self and asked the president for a
statement for the administration's
views.
Strives for Peace.
In his letter the president said he
will "do everything in my power to
keep the United States out of war,"
continuing in part:
"I think the country will feel no
uneasiness about my course in that
respect Through many anxious
months I have striven for that object,
amidst difficulties more manifold than
can have been apparent upon the sur
face and so far I have succeeded. I
do not doubt that I shall continue to
succeed.
Stand for Rights.
"But in any event our duty is
clear. No nation or group of na
tions has the right while the war Is
in progress to alter or disregard the
principles which all nations have
agreed upin in mitigation of the hor
rors and sufferings of war and if the
clear rights of American citizens
should ever unhappily be abridged or
denied by any such action we should,
it seems to me, have in honor no
choice as to what our own course
should be.
"It is important to reflect that if
in this instance we allowed expedi
ency to take the place of principle,
the door would inevitably be opened
to still further concession.
Impossible to Yield.
"What we are contending for in
this matter is of the very essence of
the things that have made America a
sovereign nation. She cannot yield
them without conceding her own im
potency as a nation and making vir
tual surrender of her independent
position among the nations of the
world."
The president wrote his letter dur
ing the afternoon shutting himself up
in his study.
No Change Announced.
At the state department today it
was stated that in its international
aspects the situation had no changed
in the slightest degree for three or
four days.
Today's developments in congress'
showed the administration leaders
holding their lines against any such
action as the president opposes.
