Mrs. Clay Lewis died at her home,
1300 Nineteenth street, February 19,
after a protracted illness of several

woman, having joined the Burns M.
E. church in 1872. Mrs. Lewis was
born in Corenth, Miss., July 4, 1852,
and was married to Mr. Clay Lewis
on July 17, 1870. To this union five
children were born. The funeral ser
vices were held at the residence Mon
day afternoon, conducted by Rev. S.

OLD SETTLER G0NE.
Thos. H. M. Benton.
Thomas Benton died at the home
of Henry Miracle in the east part of
Sigourney at the age of 73 years.
That is the age Tom claimed, al
though many persons believed him
much older. Tom Benton was born
in Morgan county, Mo., a slave. But
he lived to be an old man and died
more probably of old age than any
thing else.
Tom had been in bad physical con
dition for a number of years, but
stuck to his post in the barber shop
here until about three years ago,
when he was obliged tq retire on ac
count of his physical infirmities.
Tom was a young man at the
breaking out of the civil war Hi^
a car of nwles ""'tP
the south and Tom and two other
young Negro slaves were to accom
pany the shipment. They became
suspicious that they were included
with the sale of the mules and before
the start was made they appropriated
a couple of horses and ran off. Tom
landed in Leavenworth, Kansas, and
there allied himself with the union
army. He was valet for one of the
generals and remained with him
throughout the war.
When the war was over Tom landed
at Monmouth, Illinois. From there
he went to Galesburg, from Galesburg
he came to Iowa, first to Muscatine,
then to Washington and landed in Sig
ourney in 1871. Here he remained
ever since. He had learned the bar
ber trade and stuck to it until he quit
business three years ago. Tom Ben
ton knew personally all the old time
residents of this town and with his
death perhaps has gone a greater
amount of the unwritten history of
this town than with any other man.
His wife died many years ago, leav
ing one son, Elmer Benton, Who now1
resides in Fort Dodge, Iowa, and a
brother, Wm. Chisam, of What Cheer.
The funeral was held from the
Christian church Sunday afternoon
and was largely attended.
Below we publish an excerpt from
the Sigourney Review, the leading pa
per of that city:
Tom Benton is dead. Tom was
just an old Negro all the days we
knew him. He was our next door
business neighbor and it is said that
the opinion of a neighbor as to the
character of a man is better than
that of his minister. Tom was a
thoroughbred and his skin was very
black, but under that black skin beat
a heart as white as any man we ever
knew We knew Tom very well and
for a'number of years when we were
struggling along for an existence
Tom Benton was the only barber in
the town who took the Review. Tom
was close, but charitable. He made a
success of his business. He was a
good neighbor and a loyal friend.
He was bom a slave and died with a
plenty. He was a physical giant, but
never used his great strength to
harm any man. In our opinion

Thomas H. M. Benton waa a great
man. True, he dia not rise to as
high a fame as some, but he started
much lower. A man may become
governor of a state or president of a
nation, but the chances are that he
was born close to fame. Tom Ben
ton came into this world the property
of another man—a chattel—and rose
from that position to be an honorable
citizen and an honored man by hun
dreds who knew him.
