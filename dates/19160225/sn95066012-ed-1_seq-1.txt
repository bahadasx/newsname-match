President Writes Letter to Senator
Stone Stating Positively That
He Will Not Yield.
Washington, Feb. 25. President
Wilson at the end of two days of agi
tation in Congress for some action
warning Americans off armed mer
chant ships of the European belliger
ents, last night wrote Senator Stone,
chairman of the Senate foreign rela
tions committee, that he could not
consent to any abridgment of the
rights of American citizens in any res
pect. The letter follows:
February 24, 1916.
My dear Senator:! very warmly
appreciate your kind and frank letter
of today and feel that it calls for an
equally frank reply.
You are right In assuming that I
shall do everything In my power to
keep the United States out of war. I
think the country will feel no uneasi
ness about my courso in t). respect.
Through many anxious monies I have
striven for that object amidst difll-
cultles more manifold than can have
been apparent upon the surface and
so far I have succeeded. I do not
doubt that I shall continue to succeed.
The course which the central Euro
pean powers have announced their In
tention of following In the future with
regard to undersea warfare seems for
the moment to threaten insuperable
obstacles, but its apparent meaning Is
so manifestly inconsistent - with ex
plicit assurances recently given us by
those powers with . regard to tholr
treatment of merchant vessels on the
hiSh seas that I must believe that ex
planations will presently, ensue which
will put a different aspect upon it. AVe
have had no reason to question , their
good faith or fidelity to their promises
In the past and I for one, feel confi
dent we shall have none in . the fu
ture. . -
But in any event our duty is clear.
No nation, no group of nations, has
the right while war is in progress to
alter or disregard the principles which
all nations have agreed upon in ; miti
gation of the horrors and sufferings of
war; and if the clear rights of Ameri
can citizens should ever unhappily be
abridged or denied by any such ac
tion we should, it seems to me, have
in honor no choice as to what our
own course should be.
For my own part I cannot consent
to any abridgment of the rights of
American citizens in any respect. The
honor and self respect of the nation is
Involved. Wc covet peace and shall
preserve It at any cost but the loss of
honor. To forbid our people to exer
cise their rights for fear we might be
called upon to vindicate them would
bo a deep humiliation indeed. It
would be an Implicit, all but an ex-
Grc n Cut Bore Rne and Meat Can
not be Beai as ?n tgg Producer
Any Poultry Food that will Increase
egg production more than 800 per
cent In the middle or winter when
eggs are high and scarce is certainly
something to be sought after by Poul
trymcn. L. M. Boulds of Island Pond,
Vt, -writes to C. S. Page of Hyde
Park, as follows: "Your Green Cut
Bone for Poultry cannot be beat. It
brought my eggs up from one or two
a day to seventeen so far. We would
not be without it Enclosed find
check for one more barrel."
Green Cut Bone and Meat like that
sold to Mr. Boulds will be sent by Mr.
Page during freezing weather, freight
paid to almost any Station, for the
small sum of ?4.00 for a 200 pound
barrel. Send money by registered
letter, check, postal or express money
order and the goods will be promptly
forwarded.

plicit, acquiescence in the violation of
the rights of mankind everywhere and
of what ever nation or allegiance. It
would be a deliberate abdication of
our hitherto proud position as spokes
man even amidst the turmoil of war
for the law and the right. It would
make everything this government has
attempted and everything that it has
achieved during this terrible struggle
of nations meaningless and futile.
It Is important to reflect tbat If in
this instance we allowed expediency
to take this place i of principle, the
door would enevltably be opened to
still further concessions. Onco accept
a single abatcrhent of right aud many
other humiliations would certainly
follow and the whole fine fabric of in
ternational law might crumble under
our bands piece by piece. What we
are contending for In this matter is of
the very essence of the things that
have made America a sovoreign na
tion. She cannot yield them without
conceding her own impotence as a na
tion and making virtual surrender of
her independent position among the
nations of the world.
I -am speaking, my dear senator, in
deep solemnity, without heat, with a
clear, consciousness of the high re
sponsibilities of my office, and as
youj Sincere and devoted friend. If
we Mould Unhappily differ, we shall
differ iis friends; but where issues so
momentous as these are involved wo
must. Just because we are friends,
spek our, 'rninds without reservation.
Faithfully yours,
- WOODROW WILSON.

A card party was given in I. O. O.
F. hall Saturday evening by the par
ishioners of St. Joachim's church.
Quito a large number attended The
proceeds were for the benefit of that
church.
Mr. and Mrs. Neal Dolan returned
from their wedding trip Sunday.
They arrived at Hoosac Tunnel from

County Improvement society last
Thursday evening with a view tq
holding a week's campaign similar to
what has recently been held in Stam
ford. It is understood that this cam
paign would be no expense to the
town with perhaps the exception of
entertaining some of the speakers
while here. Surely Readsboro has
need of improvement along a number
of lines and if there is some way that
these can bo brought before the peo
ple why not take it up? Another
meeting will be held i nlhe- town hall
Saturday evening, Feb.. 2.6 when it is
hoped a large representation of the
towns people will be present. Mr.
Bartlett will again speak. .
Mr., and Mrs. Alfred Johnson
passed their 50th wedding anniver
sary Friday, Feb. 18. Mr. Johnson Is

the late Rev. N. D. Sherman on Feb.

and Had Been a Resident of Ben

James H. Livingston diei at his
home on Booth Terrace Thursday
afternoon after an illness of several
weeks which gradually .undermined
his strength. The end came suddenly
following several sinking - spells , but
his family had known for some time
that his condition was serious.
Mr. Livingston was born in Bald
wln8ville, near Syracuse, in 1847 and
was G9 years old this week. While
still a Email boy his parents moved to
Cambridge, N. Y., where he started to
learn the printer's trade at the age of
13. The paper where ho .. was em
ployed failed and he went to Rutland
where he completed his trade and wa3
employed for sometime. He then went
to New York where he worked for sev
eral years. At one time ho started to
study medicine to become a physician
but was compelled to give it up be
cause of illness.
About 1S73 he came to Hoosick
Falls and embarked in the newspaper
aud job printing, business. He ro
malnod in Hoosick Fulls for 10 years
and then became , associated with
Charles IT. Davenport of Brattleboro,
later buying from .'him the . Bennington
Reformer which was started by Mr.
Davenport and the late A.' P. Chllda.
Mr. Livingston owned and edited the
Reformer for 19 years, selling out in
1902, since which tiiue he has been en
gaged In the Job printing business on
Pleasant street. ,, .. .

James II. Livingston was one of the
most vivid and trenchant writers who
ever wielded an editorial pen In Ver
mont Ho felt strongly and had a re
markable power of expresslop. In
newspaper controversy he had no
equal in this part of the country. He
was a master of sarcasm and quick to
see a point.
When he espoused a cause he was
always a force to be reckoned with
and he did an important work in sup
port of many thing3 of merit. He
fought Ipng, and successfully for a
water isystem for Bennington and the
Sevonlh ward school is one of the
fruits of his earnest efforts. .He was
a warm friend and generous and pub
lic spirited In both public and private
life.
Ho was ono of the charter members
of Bennington lodge of Elks and a
Past Exalted Ruler of the lodge. He
was one of the best printers In the
state and often insisted on doing a
better job than he was paid for merely
because he hated to see low grade
work turned out of his shop. He will
be sincerely mourned by a wide circle
of friends.
