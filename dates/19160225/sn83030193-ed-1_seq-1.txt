rade on tH. Patrick's Hay," declared
.Mayor Mltchel to-day In discussing

old friend, liodcrlck J. Kennedy, head
of one of the factious, that he favored

faction, bccuuso of political affilia
tion "1 asked Kennedy and Ileajy, both
old friends of mine, to como nnd talk

I got thorn here I tried to impress
upon them the undeslrabillty of a lot
of good Irishmen lighting over noth
ing. An Irishman is never afraid to
tight for something tangible, but it
struck mo that the difference of
opinion involved on this occasion
wasn't t-crious enough to spilt a flno
big St. Patrick's Day parade.
"Ilealy agreed to meet the other
side half way. but Kennedy would
liavo nothing to do with tho Hcalyltes.
So there you are. It struck mo that
Inasmuch us my old friend Kennedy

"Hut 1 am perfcctlj willing to re

and at different points, of course," ho
concluded hastily.

LAWYER MARSHALL EXPLAINS
ADMIRAL SUIT.
Louis R. Marshall wus sworn as n
volunteor witness. He read a long
statement of his service as counsel
for tho Admiral rtealty Company,
which tried to prevent the carrying
out of the dual contracts whereby the
City of New Tork became partner
with the B. R. T. in building tho new
subways. Ho started with July 38,
1311, when he received n telegram in
the Adlrondacks calling him to his
offlce on account of "Important new
business."
nalph Wolf of Hays, Hershfleld
Wolf next day retained him to carry
on tho Admiral Realty Company's
case against tho Board of Estimate
and Apportionment, thn Brooklyn
Bapld Transit Company and the
Bradley Contracting Company lo re
strain them from going on with tho
proposed subway extensions, on the
ground that such a partnership was
unconstitutional. As he told his story
he mentioned conferences with Genres
S. Coleman, chief counsel for the Pub-
He Service Commission. Mr. Coleman
testified on Wednesday that ho did
not remember any such conferences,
"Are you sure you met and talked
with Mr. ColemanV asked Counsel
Frank Moss.
"Yes. quite," replied Mr. Marshall.
"And ou are perhaps as busy as

"I would not make comparisons,"

Ropes Stretched to Keep
Crowd in Check When
Champion Arrives To-Day.
FIGHTER IN FINE SHAPE.
Weighs 260 Pounds Now and
Will Meet Moran at
About 2'I5.
Jess Wlltard, the heavyweight
champion, is in town. He arrived to
day from Chicago on tbs Twentieth
Century Limited, A crowd of en
thusiasts Jammed the Grand Cen
tral Station to meet him. Ropes
bad to be stretched around tq prevent
their swamping the championship
party. The platform along which the
train pulled in was also roped off for
Hp benefit, of, scores of newspaper
msrt and phetorraphera who crowded
toward the car In which Wlllard and
his manager made the trip Eaat. In
addition, It seemed as If all the col
ored porters in the New York Cen
tral's employ bad knocked off worlc
to g.t a glimpse at the big fellow
who laid Jack Johnson low In navana
last April.
Wlllard was snapped In a dozen
different poses, and all went well
with his manager, Tom Jones, until
ho detected some movlo men on tho
Job. Jones hit tho celling right away.
"Duok, Jess, or keop walking," ho
shouted to tho big smiling champion.
"Tho newapapens can lmvo anything,
but I won't stand for moving pic
tures," belched Jones as he tried to
kocp Jess out of ran-o of the cam
eras. Despite preceding stories of WU
lard's Illness in Chicago, the big
champion appeared In excellent con
dition. He said ho weighed 260
pounds and expected to enter the ring
against Moran weighing between 245
and 248 pounds. He admitted having
had a cold and neuralgia, but never
the grippe. Ho has long since been
rid of both complaints and has even
done some road work as preliminary
trailing. Tom Jones proudly an
nounced that If necessary Wlllard
could go Into the ring and defend bis
title to-morrow.
Tex IUckard, tho promoter, Jack
Curley and several others more or
less concerned with the fight sched
uled for Madison Square Garden on
March 26, assisted in the official wel
come of Wlllard. Rlckurd expressed
s-urprba at the big fellow's apparent
good condition. Tex told Jess and
Jones that already (25,000 In cash had
been received for tickets and that all
told reservations for seats at the
fight amounting to J'0,000 bad been
received.
After considerable trouble getting
outside the station Jones, Curloy and
Wlllard reached an automobile and
were ridden off to tbo Colonial Hotel
at Elghty-flrat Street and Columbus
Avenue, where Wlllard will live while
here. His regular training will begin
to-morrow at the Pioneer A. U.
Walter Monahnn, who was ono of the
champion's sparring partners in
Havana, is on his way from Chicago
now, accompanied by Roy Archer,
Wlllard's secrotftry. Oet that secre
tary thing? They are due to-day.
Jack Hemple and two other spar
ring partners will also bo engaged.
Tho general teene which marked
Wlllard's arrival was a reminder of
the day Jim Jeffries reached here to

pass by two to one.
