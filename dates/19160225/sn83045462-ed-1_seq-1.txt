Last Great Offensive
of Germans Against
the French, Is Claim
PARIS, February 2,"?. ? German
troops taking part in the opera- j
tions before Verdun were given
to understand that this was to he
the last and the great offensive
against France, according to
statements made by prisoners
reported in the I'aris newspapers
this morning. The following
f>h rase is quoted from an order
published by (Jen. von Deimling
on the eve of the Verdun battle:
"In the course of the last offensive
against France I hope
that the Kith Army Corps will
distinguish itself as it has done
in the past."
LONDON, February 25.?The
French have been forced back still
further on the defenses of Verdun
in the face of the great German
drive for the fortress, and the j
Teutons now are at one point not
more than five and a half miles
distant.
The German war office an?minrf?H
tnrlav tlio cantnrp nt all
French positions in the region
north of Verdun as far as the
ridge of Loudcmont, just south
of Beaumont.
The number of prisoners has
been increased by more than 7,000
to over lo.oco. Capture of the
fortified villages and farms of
Champneuville, Cotellate, Marniont,
Beaumont, Chambrettes
and Ornes was announced.
The fighting north of Verdun!
is diminishing in violence, the i
French war office announced to-!
day. No attack by the Germans j
was attempted la<t night. The
otticial statement admits that the |
French have fallen hack to the
rear of Beaumont.
London Not Fearful.
The great battle which is being watched
in Kngland with keen interest, but
thus far without anxiety, is regarded
here as the long expected bigger spring
offensive. it is pointed out that the
French, profiting by their eariier experiences
in the war. now rarely hold their
advanced trenches strongly, and that,
therefore, their withdrawal at some
points to the second line is no sign of
weakness. #
On the other hand, it is believed that
the French generals are pursuing the
tactics of allowing the enemy to assault j
in masses, which Involves enormous sacrifices
to the Germans. The military
critics point out that after three days
of desperate assault the French second
line defenses are still intact everywhere.
.Line Bent, Not Broken.
Po f;?r the Gcrrijans, by sheer weight
of men and metal, have succeeded in
forcing the French left wing back for
^ three Vrniles, but they have made little
impresaioh on the center. The line is
bent, but far from broken. The nature
of the country between Keaumont and
Samogneux lends itself more to attack
than to defense, and the French command
appears to have brought the line
back chiefly to avoid useless losses as
well as to take up positions that are
more easily oerended. No infantry atlacks
were made by the Germans on
the extremities of the battle front,
their action being confined to violent
ami continuous artillery operations, but
the French artillery has succeeded in
holding its own. The assaults ended
at the heights of Herbebois and the
positions of l>eu\ Jumelles. Between'
these latter points passes an important
road which, after skirling the
heights of the Meuse, joins the main
load from JOtain to L>am viliiers.
Losses Held Appalling.
The French defense, according to
military experts, has proved itself
most effective by inflicting appalling
losses on the Germans. Prisoners !
taken yesterday stated that whole regiments
have been wiped out. It is exported,
however, that the Germans will j
s return to the change with renewed
L fury, as they desire to get within reach

PETROGRAD, February 25.?An official
dispatch from Teheran says:
"After a series of battles in Persia,
the remnants of the adversary troops
were reorganized and concentrated in *
the region of Kermanshah, and with
the help of German and Turkish sappers
occupied and fortified two mountain
passes? Bibesurks pass, an almost
impregnable natural position, and
Sakhae pass. News has now been received
that our troops dislodged the
enemy from Bidesurks pass and occupied
Sakhae pass, and are now pursuing
the Turks, w(io are in full retreat
toward Kermanshah. Ifcyr forces cap- I
lured three field puns, one mountain
pun. a quantity of shells, ammunition,
wagons and field machine guns."
Sequal to Strategic Moves.
The Russian success in the region of
Kermanshah is a se<rucl to a series of
strategic Russian operations in Persia,
with the purpose of putting an end
to the activities of hostile mountain
forces ami organized bands of Kurds.
Russian progress in Persia, however,
is regarded here as of more than local |
significance, indicating greater possibility
of a junction of the Russian with i
the British expeditionary forces in '
Mesopotamia. On dial account the for- j
tunes of the ritish forces are witched
here with great interest.
After the retreat from Hamadau all
hostile forces which succeeded in escaping
were concentrated in the Kermanshah
district. Taking advantage of
the strong defensive nature of this region.
they fortified themselves in the
mountain passes and prepared to resist
strongly any Russian attempt to drive
them further. Simultaneous frontal
and flank attacks by the Russians,
however, have already forced the Turks
to make a partial retirement.
Turks Claim Victory.
CONSTANTINOPLE, February 2."i.?
British forces in Mesopotamia made an
attack on the Turkish position at Fela
hie. below Kut-el-Arnara, the war of- |
flee announces, hut were driven back
with considerable losses. The statement,
which is under date of February
24. follows:
"Mesopotamian front: An enemy detachment
of about one battalion attempted
to approach our positions .near
Felahie, but was compelled by our fire
to retreat, leaving .numerous dead.
Among those who fell during the last
battle at Felahie were seven British
officers. Recently we took prisoner
seventeen soldiers of the enemy troops,
who, in the course of battle, fled into
the surrounding country.
'Caucasus fronts: Battles continue
without interruption.
Dardanelles Activity.
"Dardanelles front: Some enemy
cruisers bombarded from time to time
between February 18 and 22 the beaches
near Seddul-Bahr and Teke-Burnu, |
Kum Kaleh and Seddul Bahr forced
them to retreat without their being
able to continue to fire for any considerable
time. Enemy aeroplanes recently
flew over the Dardanelles, but were
driven off and pursued by our battle
aeroplanes.
"On February 20 an enemy cruiser
under protection of mine sweepers
penetrated the gulf of Saros, supported
by three enemy observation aeroplanes.
The enemy bombarded without success
the coast near Galata and Gallipoli (on
the Gallipoli strait). One of our battleaeroplanes
drove ofT the enemy aircraft,
whereupon the cruiser ceased

The House of Representatives
will begin discussion of the Borland
proposal for an eight-hour
day for government employes
without an increase of pay by the
end of next week, according to
information obtained today at the
Lapitoi. The proposition to
make the government employes
work eighfhours instead of seven,
as at present, in accordance with
Mr. Borland's amendment to the
legislative, executive and judicial
; _ .. .. i- :ii i. _ ?
appropriation inn, nas arousea a
storm of opposition, and various
activities came into play today
against the proposition.
Some members of the Mouse
are very much opposed to the
plan. Senators expressed the intention
of looking into the matter
before deciding how they will
vote, provided the question ever
comes before-the Senate. The
proposal is not expected to meet
with the approval of the District
Commissioners. It is said to be
possible that the American Federation
of Labor may array its
strength against the plan. If the
idea is carried out transportation
companies 01 the District may be
obliged to change their schedules,
and merchants and business men
generally might be seriously affected.
Awaits Disposal of F. O. Bill.
Chairman Byrns, in charge of the
legislative, executive and judicial subcommittee
of the House appropriations
committee, understands the bill containing
the eight-hour-day clause will
be taken up for debate in committee of
the whole as soon as the post office appropriation
bill Is out of the way. It
appears that two more days of discussion
will finish the post office measure.
After that the big supply bill, which
has this year more than ever an interested
audience in the thousands of government
employes of the city, will be
taken up.
The change which Representative
Borland effected at the eleventh hour
yesterday is believed by him to come
within the Holnian rule. This rule is
one of the standby remedies of the
House for reducing appropriations. It

Lets Excise Board Matter
Go Over Till Friday.
CLOSING OF BARBER SHOPS
IN D. C. SUNDAYS FAVORED |
Anti-Fake Advertising Bill Also In
dorsed?Newspaper Gag Measure
Is Tabled.
The Senate District committee today
failed to act upon the nomination of
Gen. Robert G. Smith as member 0/
the District excise board and the matter
goes over until the meeting of the
committee scheduled for next Friday.
The Smith nomination was up for dis- j
cussion for a short time before the j
committee adjourned at noon when the
Senate assembled.
The committee had before it the report
of the subcommittee on judiciary
adverse to Gen. Smith.
A bill introduced by Senator Works of
California to compel the closing of barber
shops in the District Sundays was ordered
favorably re|>orted to the Senate. Before;
passing upon the bill the committee;
amended it so as to include the barber i
shops in the Senate and House wings of1
the Capitol. Senator Ken yon of Iowa I
gave notice that lie intended to offer a
resolution to do away with th*ese barber i
shops in the Capitol, which now supply j
senators and members with free shaves
and free hair cuts.
Others Unfavorably Reported.
The committee also ordered unfavor- |
able reports on the House bills provid- j
ing for the appointment of the record- '
er of deeds and the register of wills |
for the District. The House bill for
the appointment of the recorder of
deeds would place the appointment In
the hands of the District Commissioners,
and the House bill for tV"> appointment
of the register of wills would
place the appointment in the hands of :
the District Supreme Court. At present (
both officials are appointed oy the
President. i
Another feature of the House bills
was that both of these officials must
have been a resident of the District for
three years before being eligible for
appointment.
The recorder of deeds bill came to the
full committee with an adverse report
by the subcommittee on judiciary, and
the register of wills bill with a favorable
report from the same subcommittee.
For Anti-Fake "Ad" Bill.
The committee decided to report
favorably the House bill designed to
prevent fake advertising in the Dis- j
trict, after amending the measure in I
minor details.
The bill introduced by Senator \
Works of California to prohibit the
publication of details of crimes and ac- j
cidents in newspapers In the District
of Columbia was ordered reported to |
the Senate with the recommendation
that it be laid on the table. That is
one way of killing: the bill, it was explained.
