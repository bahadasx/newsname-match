from West Point two and a half viun
hence as rapidly as he has attained
rank and prominence In athletic pur
suits, he will be the recipient of words
of commendation and the like from the
very start of his career as a soldier.
Cadet Oliphant is one of the best
athletes that ever entered the Military
academy. In fact, he Is the only ca-
aet wno ever won the coveted "A" in
four sports since the beginning of ath
letic competition at the Point, 26
years ago.
No West Pol.it caa Us ever been
graduated with tho "A" won In more
than three branches of sport at tho
academy. There are upward of 400
"A" men among the alumni of West
Point, too, and most of these men
were the entire four years accumulat
ing their "A's." Oliphant has been
there since June, 1914.
Oliphant is a son of Marlon E. Oli
phant of Drucevllle, Ind. He was
born at Bloomfield, that state, twenty-two
years ago. He was a leader In
athletics among the boys of bis town
at an early age, and attended the
Washington (Ind.) High school for
three years. Ho left Washington and
went to the Linton (Ind.) High school,
from which institution he was gradu

classed as the greatest athlete who
ever graced that university with his

TO UPHOLD HONOR OF COAST
At Least Twenty Athlete to Tike
Part In National Championship
at Newark, N. J.
When the track and Held athletes
from all parts of the United States
atrip for the national championship
at Newark next summer, the Pacific
coast will be represented by the larg
est aggregation that ever Went out to
uphold the honor of that part of the
United States.
Flans are being laid far In advance
by the men of athletic affairs on the
coast for the raising of a large fund
to finance a team of not loss than
twenty men for the Newark games.
The Olympic club of San Francisco,
the Multnomah Amateur Athletic as
sociation of Portland, the Seattle Ath
letic club and the Los Angeles Ath
letic club will take the lead In the
work of organizing an all-Pacific coast
team.
It Is expected each of these organi
zations will contribute funds to be
added to the money that will be al
lowed the Pacific coast by the cham
pionship committee for the transpor
tation of tho team. Added to these
funds will be the profits ot the Pa
cific coast national championship try
outs, which -vlll be run on a large
seal' In ono jf the coast cities.
The victory of the Olympic club In
the 1916 national championships at
the Panama-Pacific exposition has
brought about a fine, healthy boom in
track sports on the coast, and the
natural result Is a desire to maintain
the prestige won at the Frisco' meet
In the championships at Newark. In
1916.

London. The following is published
In tho London Da!'y Express from lta
correspondent in Paris:
"When the snow-laden wind comes
roaring over the Alsatian hills, Its Icy
blast chilling the body to the bone,
the 'pollus,' huddled together, many
feet below the ground, draw their
blankets closer around them, for the
blizzard creeps down every nook and
cranny, and the men, now experienc
ing their second winter campaign In
the Vosges, mumur: 'How cold the
Boches must feel!'
"This note of cheerfulness prevails
throughout the French lines, and no
where more than In this sector of the
front. I have chatted with Turcos,
who now see snow for the first time,
and with men whose extremities were
frost bitten last winter, but everyone
Is happy with the Idea that, no matter
how much he feels the cold, the plight
ot the Germans must be much worse.
"Here we are In German territory;
there Is no gainsaying that aid to
cheerfulness. How far we have pro
gressed I am forbidden to state, but I
can affirm that no fewer than twenty
Alsatian towns are now within the
penny postal rate of France. Every
yard gained is a step nearer the Rhine,
but for every foot of ground conceded
by the enemy there is bloody fighting.
Hartmannsweller-Kopf has become a
symbol of the conflict In Alsace; in no
other sector of the front, so the French
general staff say, has the fighting been
so severe, but the importance of Its
loss or gain must not be exaggerated.
"The summit, It Is true, commands
a great portion of tho plain of Al
sace, t)ut ever since the French first
reached the foot of the hill the whole
of .Hartmannsweller-Kopf has never
been wholly In the possession of either
French or German.
Warfare in Black and White.
"Here I warfare In black and white.
The black uniforms of the Chasseurs
Alplns are silhouetted against a back
ground of snow. From an observation
post one sees columns of sure-footed
mules carrying parts ot guns, and com
panies of men, like myriads of ants,
crawling through the mountain passes;
br again, patches of black, vague
emudgea, whirling over the snow. More
Chasseurs Alplns rushing on skis
over hill and dale, stopping, twisting,
firing and rushing on again; agile lit
tle men who are the terror of the Ger
mans' lives in this sector.
"Tales of their daring are legion. It
Is not so long ago that a handful ot
them crawled through the German
line and brought back a munition
train 1 It was in the early hours of a
winter' morning. They found the
train with steam up; the engine was
started, the enemy was taken com
pletely by surprise, and the train was
brought to a spot noar enough to the
French lines for the men to remove
the munitions and destroy the train.

they are called, were concerned In the
SAVES LIFE BY TRANSFUSION
Chicago Physician Reports Remark
able Success of New Method In
of Asphyxiation.
Chicago, 111. Dr. W. H. Burmelster,
i coroner's physician, performed ex
perimeuta In a new and remarkable
use of blood transfusion. He ox
pressed the opinion, based on his ex
periments, that It 1b posslblo to re
store to life those dead from asphyx
iation, drowning or other accidents
which cut off the supply of oxygen.
Doctor Burmelster has restored to
life several rabbits and dogs after
they have been asphyxiated and after
all other artificial means had failed.
The operation consisted in the trans
fusion of blood Into the vein of the
"dead" animal, accompanied with the
regular methods of artificial respira
tion. Doctor Burmelster's experiments
consisted in asphyxiating his subjects
to n point where heart massage, heart
stimulants and oxygen administra
tions failed to bring signs of life. The
rabbits or dogs were then hung by
taking of Sudel farm, which opened up
the road to the Retnbach valley. After
some skirmishing between outposts
(he French established themselves on
the River Sutz. Tbe snow was fall
ing thickly when the French began
their advance In the teeth of a hurri
cane ot shells that came from the
German batteries on the hills behind
Cernay, but nothing daunted the
"devils," although they were two days
on the way, sleeping In tbe snow.
"At dawn on the third day the French
outposts heard the sound ot firing. It
was caused by the skiers, who had
been out all night looking for the
enemy. They returned, bringing back
with them two wounded German offi
cers and six men.
"The ruins of the Chateau Freud
stein concealed tbe guns, and massed
In neighboring valleys were the Ger
mans. Enemy airmen had been hover
ing over the column since It set out,
and undoubtedly the enemy was trying
to draw the French Into a trap, but
Teuton slyness went astray. Soon
the enemy found he had no chance of
ambushing the French, and he changed
his tactics and sent out one company
from a Bavarian regiment to wipe out
the 'blue devils.' The speed of the
men on ekis was too great, however,
for the heavy-footed Boches and they
were soon outdistanced. A French
battery of heavy artillery received a
telephone message giving them the ap
proximate range, and after a period of
bombardment tho guns In the ruins of
the chateau were silenced.
Storming Sudel Farm.
"Then came the opportunity sorght
by the 'devils;' they began their attack
against the center of the German posi
tion, which was Sudel farm. They ad
vanced under cover to within about
three hundred yards of tbe position
they had to storm, but the last stretch
was across open ground.
"After a brief but sanguinary action
the position was carried, enabling tho
Chasseurs to open a murderous fire on
their front and right
"Without the expocted support of
their artillery In the chateau, the Ger
mans were powerless against the hu
man waves that swept over them, and
they withdrew, but in good order, fight
ing a rear-guard action until the 'blue
devils' charged with the bayonet. The
action terminated in a complete rout
of the enemy and about 300 unwound
ed prisoners remained in the hands of
the French.
"A recent German communique
spoke of a repulse of a French attack
'near Metzeral,' but omitted to mention
that Metzeral is in the bands of the
French, and has been so ever since
our gallant allies won one of the most
brilliant battles of this war. When
the French advance approached Metz
eral the Germans began to make a
fortress of this little Alsatian town,
and the streets were barricaded with
barbed wire, and overturned carts
masked machine guns. The battle be
gan by an attack launched against the
forest. Trees "wero uprooted In hun
dreds by tbe French guns, and gradu
ally the enemy was pushed out ot the
forest, but It was only then that a
fresh surprise was sprung on the
French.
"The enemy had dug trenches In the
forest, which he filled with barrels of
tar; these wero connected by elec
tricity with a point behind the Ger
man lines, and as the French rushed
through the forest the barrels were
Ignited. Nevertheless, this did not
stop the advance. They reached the
outskirts of Metzeral, and here the
fighting became furious. A number
of factories were defended by the en
emy, and each had to be carried sepa
rately by the attacking party.
"From windows machine guns
poured a hall of lead on the heads of
the French. The men had to break
down the doors and fight their way
up, story by story. South of the town
the enemy defended tho cemetery,
which held up the attack for a whole
nlgbt. The tombs were already torn
away by the French shells, but the
vaults were the scene of fighting of
their hind legs and transfusion made
Into a vein in the ear ot each subject.
"The reaction In most cases was
almost Instantaneous," he said. "The
animal would begin to breathe and the
heart to contract and expand In a few
seconds despite the fact that artificial
respiratory means had been Ineffec
tive." Lie Costs $20; Speeding $5
St. Louis. A fine of $20 "for lying"
and $5 for speeding was assessed
against Louis Greenspon of No. 5829
Westminster place, a merchant, by
Police Judge Hogan today.
Greenspon was arrested. It was
charged that he drove his machine at
25 miles an hour on Locust street, be
tween Beaumont street and Twenty
first street When he was arraigned
Judge Hogan asked him if he bad not
been arrested before for speeding.
Greenspon said he bad net. Hogan
had the record looked up and It
showed that Greenspon was fined $6

Capture Metzeral Cemetery.
"The cemetery waa carried In the
early hour of the morning; but not
before it held more dead titan ever
were buried in it.
"The taking of this salient did not
complete tbe task set to the French.
Practically every house in the town
was defended, and from cellar t the
top story the French had to fight their
way before Metzeral was finally in
their hands. Truly, the enemy has not
cause to make much mention of Metz
eral In his official communications.
"At the same time that the French
were attacking in this sector, a sofe
ond successful offensive movement
was being carried' out along both:
banks ot the Fecht. Two Important
hills, Nos. 666 and 698, were stormedt
and eventually Slllackerwasen was
taken. From this point Munster was
bombarded, which led to the evacua
tion ot this town.
"Altklrch was evacuated jij- trie Ger
mans two weeks ago; arid not for the'
re&SORS. put forward by the Basel1
newspapers. The Germans have Insin
uated that the civil population was
withdrawn because of the arrival ot
fresh troops to undertake an offensive
in this sector, but the truth is that
the lower part of the town Is flooded,
as it usually is at this period ot the
year, and the French advance towards
Altklrch has made the town unhealthy
for the civil population.
"Hartmannsweller-Kopf Is likely to'
figure in the French communiques for
some time to come, for the German
will never give up their counter-attacks
until they are driven away from
their side of the hill. Surprise at
tacks here are always to be expected,
for both sides now know every Inch
of the ground, and on the summit ot
the hill the German and French
trenches are only about five yards
apart.
Twelve Battles a Night.
"Very often a battle lasting some
hours will take place for the posses
sion of a mere stump of a tree, and a
tree stump haa been known to change
hands twelve times during the course
of a night An account given to me
by a French soldier of a recent French
offensive on Hartmannsweller-Kopf
Is dramatic in Its simplicity. This
man has taken part in no fewer than
fifteen battles tor tbe hill.
'"The crest of the bill was white
with smoke,' he says. 'For two days
both sides had left the top of the bill,
because both our guns and theirs were
raking the ground. We had buried the
German dead the first time tbe crest
came into our possession, but their big
shells, from a battery ot Austrian
guns, 305's, disinterred their dead, so
that when we charged we stumbled
over arms and legs and limbless
trunks.
"Our attack was launched from
three sides; the first charge only took
us forward about 160 yards, and then
we had to return to our original posi
tions; It was heartbreaking. Before
we could attack again the enemy sent
up re-enforcements, but something
must have gone wrong, for hundreds
of tbclr men were cut (town by their
own artillery Bring from the rotas ot
the Hitzstein chateau.
"We ceased our attack when night
fell, but our artillery redoubled Its fu
rious bombardment of the enemy's
trenches. Their guns fired at ours,
and ours fired at theirs and at their
trenches. Thirty feet below tbe
ground, snug In our dugouts, we could
feel the earth trembling. The Ger
mans kept their men In the trenches
because they never knew when oar ar
tillery would cease firing and our in
fantry attack begin again. That Is
why we captured more than thirteen
hundred prisoners. They were hag
gard and shaking when they wero
marched into our lines, for no soldiers
on earth could stand what our artil
lery gave them.
