POTASH BEARING BEtiS
OF NEW KEXICO
"Southwestern
Trail" Tells
Itcsourco of
of Valuablo
the Sunshino Stato That
was Recently Discovered
MUCH EXCITEMENT AMONG
SCIENTIFIC INVESTIGATORS
Potash bods uf unhnnrd ofoxtcnt
ore bolle ved tubo located in the
l'crtnian strata of eastern New Mox
Water from both dnop and shallow
wells when analyzed was found to
contain in somo instances as high
as 14 per cent nvailablo potash and
creating considerable cxcltomont
among sclentifiolnvestlgntorB. The
great war has shut nil tlio chief sup
ply of potash from Germany which
rcaehos the Utdted State? as kali
one of most important ingrodlonts
in fertilizers, explosivas and inrtny
other produots. Atnarioan imports
in 1013 totalled moro thanS12,00(),
000. Tlio discovery of potash beds
In largo quantity would transform
Agricultural conditions an the North
Of American continent. Potash oIbo
is used for chemloal purposes, gun
powder, matches, soap and dyes
Their valuo could not bo determined
in dollars nnd cents Indications
, aro that tlio Permian red bed
which abound in Texas, Oklahoma
and Mu.v MjxIim in thai great eui
pire known as the Panhandle con
tain potash in undreamed quantities
Both state and govermont snlontistH
aroglv'ng the matter their attention
Tile Gorman kali mines employ 3G,
000 men. The world' demand o
potash normally oxeceds 11,000,000
tons.
What actually has been found are
salt beds C00 and Ü00 feet In thick
ness In widely separated wells in
New Moxico and Toxas containing
potash' in varying quantities. At
Loable, N, M. largo Halt beds were
penetrated at a depth of 700 feot
Uofore tonchlng these immense salt
deposits a peculiar red shale, sand
stone and potash bearing deposit is
penotratcd. The dip of the earth's
surfaco in ports of Western Toxas
and Eastern Oklahoma makes it
certain that these potash beds aro
very near the surface und can bn
worked iu a practical manner.
The same strata was familiar to
geologists years ago, but tlio depo
sits of potash woro at such depth
and In such small quantities that
It seemed hopless to speak of coin
morclal development. All this l8
changed now, as may be seen from
tlio official report of Prof, J. A
Udden, geologist of the University
of Texas, who bellovos that the
"red salt horizon," as shown in the
Miller and Hodeu borings and dis.
cussed later in detail, will lie be.
tweon 800 and 1700 foot below the
surface nf the surrounding country
or from 'J00 to 2100 feet above sea
level.
In most of tlio wells bored, no
special preparation was made to
keep accurate track of the potaih
bearing strain, However, the one
great fact was established that the
salt beds nf several hundred fcol
thickness undoubtedly bear relation
to each nther in the different wclU
bored, and that enough potash-bear
ing strata has been pnnettated to
warrant careful sclontlllo explora
lion of the territory over which the
various wells aro. scattered It is
believed that a potash mineral,
bucIi as carnalito, has been folihd iu
several oi tlio borings. Hits Is n
bright red substance, containing
about 14 per cent of potashlum
chloride. In otio case this was
loutul at a depth ol UUO feet tu n
CO-foot vein of rock salt. In another
Instance tho mineral in question wos
found at n depth of 1700 feet in an
immense bed of rock salt. It i
this preeenco of potash mineral
which warrants lurther exploration,
jays Prof Udden. The wells which
showed potash bearing .oalt lie
roughly between tho Canadian nild
Pecos rivers on tlio plains or in the
breaks of Iheso at an average elevn
tion ol Houu to oouu icei ueoiogi
cally the country in which they me
located Is exceedingly Interesting
Indications every whero point to tlio
existence of a prehistoric ocean
which on:a covered that entire
part of the world.
J, I). Tunncll an architect of Tex
ico, Tex., who has spent twenty six
years In New Mexico and Texas, Is
one of tho men who Is responsible
for the Investigations now being
conducted as fegurds potash iu the
Southwest, Fourteen years ago
Mr Tunnell prospected for coal In
the vallev of tho Canadian river
almost from its sourco to within
few, miles of Tucumcari. Tlio Por
mían sandstone deposits which
throughout the course of this river
urn ever In evidence attracted 11
attention. He concluded that these
bids because of their nppoarnncefl
and color must contain large qunu
titles of valuable minerals. Mr
Tunnell asserts that in his twenty
six years' expetlonco wlthdoep weils
throughout Texas anti New jicxico
ho has become- well satisfied that
notash deposits in largo ntian
titles exist in that territory. He
was nresent when several of th
deenest wells were being drilled am
personally helped keep tho log and
cathered samóles for nnaiysis nt
varying denthi. 8everal of his
samples wero later brought
