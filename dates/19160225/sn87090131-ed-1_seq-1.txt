GETTING A START
By

HE KNOWS ONE THING WELL
Several years ago Tom began as of
foe boy in a wholesale grocery house. I
He learned the business, and in course I
of time was sent out on the road. I
He returned erestfallen, without an
order. I
"Did you call on all the storekeep
ers in Blanktown?" asked the mer
chant
"Yes, sir."
"And you received no orders?"'
"No," replied the embryo salesman.
"not one."
"That's strange," said the mer
chant "Most of the storekeepers in
that town are good customers of ours.
What did you say to them?"
"Well," drawled the young man. "I
told 'em who I was and where I came
from."
"Did you display your samples or
ask them to purchase?"
"Oh, no. If they'd wanted to buy
anything, they'd have told me,
wouldn't they?"
The merchant looked at the young
man in silence for a few moments.
"Tom," he said, "I'm afraid youll
never make a salesman. I'll put you
on the books."
So Tom became an assistant book
keeper. He was proficient and re
ceived a fair salary.
The years rolled on. Tom became c
middle-aged, and no one thought mucn i
about him any way. One day ie
knocked on the door leading to the i
firm's office and was admitted.
"What can we do for you, Tom?" I
asked the merchant.
"Want a partnership," said the book- 1
keeper.
"What!"
"Want a partnership," repeated Tom. I
Something in the man's face at
tracted the merchant's attention.
"Sit down. You say you want to be
come a partner. Have you any capi
tal to invest?"
"Not enough to mention." 1
"Then how do you expect to get a
what you want?" a
"Well," said the bookkeeper, quiet
ly, "half of your business is molasses, i
and I know molasses. If you don't
want me, Smith & Jones do."
"What!"
"Well," said Tom, calmly. "They 1
made me an offer of a tenth interest"
The merchant investigated and
found that his obscure bookkeeper
knew more about molasses than any a
other man in the trade. Tom was ad
mitted to the firm and died worth a
quarter of a million dollars.
Tom knew one thing well. Quietly I
and persistently he had perfected him- c
self, developed his natural talents, i
and had become an expert of experts.
I am aware that the average young 1
man, try as he will, may not be able to
perfect himself sufficiently in any one
branch of trade to obtain a command- 1
ing position in it; but I believe that 1
90 per cent 6f thpse who are at the I
bottom, or holding subordinate posi
tions, could rise from the ranks if they
devoted their energies persistently
and consistently to the perfecting of I
themselves in some one thing which i
is an important part of business. The
trouble with most men is that they a
do not use what they have. They
seem to be satisfied to float.
Young man, find out what you are
best fitted to do, and, when you make 1
this discovery, go to the very bottom
of it and learn it so well that you will
be an authority upon that subject.
Then you will have in you a market
able commodity, which stands for a I
liberal salary or for something better. I
Shaping of a Career.
In 1834, Lord Melbourne, then still I
home secretary in the reform cabinet, 4
and Disraeli, a beaten candidate for c
parliament, were talking together
after dinner, and the typical British I
peer, the friend of Victoria, was at- I
tracted by the cleverness of the He
brew aspirant "Lord Melbourne," as a
Disraeli told the story, which is con- i
firmed by Melbourne's biographer,
"asked how he could advance me in ]
life, and half proposed that I should be
his private secretary, inquiring what I
my object in life might be. 'To be
prime minister.'" The condescending
Whig tried gently to argue the young a
man out of what must have seemed to I
him pure infatuation; but he did not
forget the remark. When, in 1848, as
an old man, he learned of Disraell's
success in parliament, he was heard
to exclaim: "By God! the fellow will
do it yet."-Paul E. Moore, in the At
lantic.
Ways of the Hopper.
"Do you know," says the Mankoto 1
Advocate, "a teller tried to make usI
believe the other day that a visitation
of grasshoppers such as we had in
1874 wouldn't do much harm now, as
there is so much vegetation they
couldn't eat it all? When a man talks
that way we know he never took
the grasshopper degree. Why, if the
corn had been 15 feet high on every
acre in the county when those hungry
migrants lit down they'd eaten it
clean, licked the platter and kissed
the cook before noon the next day."

TO PARENTS.
Let me diverge for once from my
. policy of addressing yetan people dl
a rectly, that I may aw y words to
L. fatherrand mothf.
a The selection of a vocation is usual
ly made either by the boy himself, by
his parents, or by both.
Theoretically, at least, the parent is
~ipposed to be the best adviser for his
son, because he has seen more of him
and should be able to diagnose his
ability with some degree of accuracy.
While the parent undoubtedly in
tends to advise the son for his good, it
is obvious that neither the father nor
the mother is infallible, and that. be
ing human, they are likely to err and
influence their boy to his detriment
We are all more or less swayed by
prejudice. If a father, for example,
has made a failure of his work, he is
r likely to advise his son against it.
even though the latter may be adapted
to it Conversely, if a father has
achieved success in his vocation, he
quite naturally assumes that what he
has done well his boy can do equally
well.
1 The parent often forgets to study
his boy, and he is quite likely to as
sume that his son is fit for this and
unfit for that.
I do not consider that the advice of
any one person, whether he is a par
e ent or not, is sufficient to determine
i the vocation for a young man.
e Conposite counsel is far better than
e individual opinion.
The parent should begin to study
his son when the boy has passed his
fourteenth or fifteenth year, perhaps
before; he should watch him care
fully, talk with him in a friendly way,
and bring to his attention the advan
tages and disadvantages of the sev
eral callings, especially those for
which he thinks his son is fitted.
The father should go further, and
consult with his friends, those who
come in contact with his boy, that,
from composite counsel, he may be
t able to advise him more definitely and
more carefully.
To push or to force the boy into a
vocation, without careful thought and
t considerable study, is as wicked as it
is to rob him of his birthright.
Thousands upon thousands of boys
V have been started wrong because of
self-opinionated fathers, who, without
I consideration, forced their sons into
r vocations against their inclinations
r and ability.
Many a devoted mother and over
B ambitious father, wholly from self
pride and without any real regard for L
r their offspring, have attempted to
coerce him into some profession, when
the boy had absolutely no liking for it
i. or ability to practice it. They would
g have their son a lawyer when the boy
would make a good business man.
s They would force him to become a
teacher when he lacked the power to
t impart information. They would make
B a business man of a student who
[. loved his books more than money.
F Remember, parents, that your boy,
r on the threshold of ILfe, is soon to be
f his own master, and that you have no
i more right to force him under your
a will than you have to steal his over
r coat or shoes.
F The boy of today is the man of to
morrow, and what you do with him tt
a day may make or break him tomor
B row.
1 The Stage Englishman.
Bancroft, the English actor, brought
upon the stage a new type of languid
a Englishman. Sothern, in his "Lord
DunIreary," had represented an Eng
lish aristocrat as an absolutely brain
less idiot. When the aristocrat ap
1 peared upon the boards he was gen
erally made into a caricature of fatu
r ous imbecility.
r But Bancroft put before the eyes of
Shis audience a presentable as well as
Sa real specimen of a man of breeding,
.a little haughty and disdainful full of
Sabsurd airs, but by no means a fool.
. and always good-hearted.
Of course, the most notorions exam
3 ple of his skill was Hawtree in
a "Caste," whose appearance under the
t humble roof of the Eccles family is so
a irresistibly comic.
g He is so entirely a fish out of water,
g and yet so affably and pleasantly at
a home-a gentleman, in short, who is
t full of native kindliness.
a His Method.
S "How is it that you can tell with
1 out timing him whether or not a mo

fixed by your local ordinance?" "If I

Sbreakin' the law," replied Constable
a Sam T. Slackutter, the well-known
i sleuth of Skeedee. "And if he looks
