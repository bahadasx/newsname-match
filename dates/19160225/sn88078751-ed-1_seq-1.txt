CRAVE T(
SflUIHE CASE
Opposition
ireat Resolution
Off Armed
Washington, Feb. 34. A grave turn
in tho submarine controversy came
when formidable opposition flared up
In congress to President Wilson's de
termination to force a showdown with
Germany.
The president finds himself con
fronted with a threat from important
Democratic leaders in tho house that
a resolution will bo put through, over
his opposition, warning Americans
from traveling on armed merchant
men. Democratic leaders In the houso,
who seem to have worked themselves
Into a high state of excitement over
the submarine situation, are predict
ing that trie president's determination
to insist upon tho right of Americans
to travel with immunity on armed
merchantmen will eventually lead
this couutry Into the war. So firmly
havo the house leaders convinced
themselves of this that they moved
without delay to warn tho president
of tho growing sentiment in congress.
On the senate side also there is evi
dence of intense feeling on this sub
ject, and notice was served of tho In
tention of certain Democratic sena
tors to pr.fiss for the passage of a res
olution regardless of the president's
stand. In the senate, however, the
I administration forces seemed to be
In hotter control than In the house.
Not since the submarine Issue was
raised lias the president found him
self In such a discouraging predkw
mont. At the moment when he needs
tho strongest support to carry his Is
sue with Germany to a successful con
clusion, ho finds himself deserted by
many of the Influential leaders of his
own party, who are asserting otfenly
that congress will not stand behind
him in a course that will bring a rup
ture with Germany.
When the president heard of the
turn of nlTalro in the house and the
threats that were being uttered, he
called Chairman Flood of the house
foreign affairs committee on the tele
phone and again told him that he was
emphatically opposed to the passage
of a ipso'' Hon of warnlnc. and that
Cincinnati, Feb. 24. Charles Ku
pert, a union painter, was accused of
attempted bribery and impeding Jus
tico in an indictment reported by th
grand jury. It is alleged that he of
fered Fred E. Miller, a former union
official and prosecuting witness
against Vincent Doty, in a trial two
weeks ago, f 500 to secrete himself so
ho would not be in the jurisdiction of
tho court when the Doty case camo
up tor trial. -
TWO KILLED
Kane, Pa., Feb. 24. Two men were
killed nnd several had a narrow es
cape from death in an explosion which
totally destroyed the nitroglycerin
plant of tho Aetna Explosive company
at Emporium.

'Till I IT
llll ill
Developes In Congress
President's Policy
Warning To Keep
Merchantmen
I e preferred that the entire question
of submarine warfare should be dealt
with exclusively through diplomatic
channels.
Notwithstanding the president's op
position, members of the house com
mlttco on foreign relations expressed
the opinion that Chairman Flood and
Chairman Stone of the senate foreign
relations committee should call on the
president and acquaint him in detail
with the situation in congress. At
th's meeting of the foreign affairs
committee it was disclosed that prac
tically every member of the commit
tee was opposed to the president's
Ftand on the armed merchantmen
iBsue.
Cm of the Situation,
It Is admitted that the crux ot tho
situation, so far as its immediate
r'eriousness is concerned, lies in the
question whether Germany will post
pone her submarine decree scheduled
to go into effect on March 1, and also
in tho question whether the United
States in that event will consent to
discuss with Germany the subject of
defensive armament.
Speaker Clark and Majority Leader
Kitchin are among the big Democrats
in the house who are favorably dis
posed to the resolution warning Amer
icans. Senntor Stone, chairman of
the senate foreign relations, also
favors It, but it is understood that
Loth Mr. Stone and Speaker Clark are
using their efforts to hold congress
In check.
Senator Stcne spoke regretfully o.'
tho president's attitude, and it Is said
even told the piesident that it ho was
expected to lead his party In the sen
ate he should not be asked to lead "a
minority simply." Senator Stone inti
mated, it was said, that the presi
dent's view on tho right of Americans
to protection on armed belligerent
vessels was not shared by a majority
cf his party in congress.
The Goro hill, which may be called
up at any time, will raiso tho issue
squarely.

on for less than a 10 per cent increase
as demanded.

London, Feb. 24. Crown Prince
Frederick William and seven German
nrmy corps are engaged along a twen-ty-flvo
mile front north of Verdun in
a desperate effort to drive hack the
French defending forces, probably
with the capture of the great fortress
of Verdun In view.
There had been very heavy fighting
for a considerable period in this dis
trict of the French war zone, but with
in the last few days the attacks of tho
Germans had taken on added strength.
The battle line has been extended and
now reaches from Malancourt, on the
west, to Etaln, on the east, with Ver
dun in the center, only a few miles
southward.
Tho Berlin war office statement
says that In Upper Alsace the Ger
mans captured a position 700 yard3
wide and 400 yards deep. The war
office also announces that German
forces had penetrated tho opposing
lines for a distance of three kilome
ters (two miles) in the northern sec
tor of the Woevre, northeast of Pari3
and north of Verdun. It Is said tho
allies lost moro than 3,000 prisoners
and great quantities of material.
While at some points the French
wore unable, to resist the onslaught of
tho nttacklng forces, along much of
the front, according to the Paris com
munication, the attacks were well
sustained and very heavy losses were
inflicted on the Germans.
On the Russian and Austrian fronts
there has been considerable lighting
and tho Italians admit that at one
point th .-Mistrlans succeeded In pen
eratlng their lines.
Petrograd announces the continued
pursuit of the remnants of the Turk
ish army which fled from Erzerum
with the capture of the Turkish
stronghold by the Russians. Dis
patches report the Turks evacuating
Trehlzond. on the Black sea coast, to
wards which, however, another body ,
of Turks from Erzerum Is .said to bo '
retreating. The Russians are making
an effort to cut off this force.

ONLY PROTECTION
FOR THE COAST
Admiral Badger Would Have Great
Fleet In The Pacific
Slides At Panama
Washington. Feb. 24. That Secre
tary Daniels made a change In tho
report of the general navy board by
eliminating a recommendation for the
addition of about 17,000 men to the
personnel of the navy was the sub
stance of a statement made to the
house naval committee by Rear Ad
miral Badger of the general board.
Admiral Badger was questioned
concerning tho necessity for u fleet in
the Pacific. He said that u'tlmately
the United States would have to
maintain In that quarter a force large
enough to cope with any possible ene
my. He said it was t.ie opinion oC
tho general board that the Atlantic
should not be wealtened to enlarge
the Pacific force.
Representative Stephens of Califor
nia, seeking to show that the Pacific
coast was inadequately protected,
asked if the bonrd. when it change!
Its time hono.sil policy last year and
declared that the United States navy
should equal the strongest afloat by
1923, did not have In mind tne possi
bility that the country might have to
face simultaneously enemies in the
Pn ific and At'antic oceans.
Admiral Badger said he could an
swer that only in executive session,
which will bo held this afternoon He
explained, however, that a fleet capa
ble of dominating the Pacific ocean
was the only sure protection for the
Pacific coast, and said that the earth
blldPK ir the Panama canal had made
impossible for the present, aud possi--h'y
for another year, the use of the
fln.it In either ocean. Further discus
!ion of the csnal closure also wa3 de
ferred to the rlosed session.
Admiral Badger expressed the opin
ion thai, should tie United States
adopt a two-power standard navy,
such as recommended by the general

i board, Grat Britain would not alter
! Ler ratr of con'-'rtictlon, at least un-
til the gap between the two fleets had
been material'- reduced.
Replying to a question' by Represen
tative Callaway, the admiral said that
In framing the $2S3 000 000 building
program it first proposed under Its
new policy the board had been going
on the theory that It -aas necessary to
get as many big ships as possible
added to the fleet In the shortest time
the countn's building facilities would
permit.
"Do you think we have the same
reason for'dcs'r'ng supremacy of the
pea that England has?" Representa
tive Callaway asked. "Not at present,
perhaps," the witness replied, "hut
eventually wp would have to reach
out for our share of world trade, and
anybody v ho stood In the way of ou
gett'ng a fair deal would have to b
dealt with."
CAPTURED BY GERMANS
