Sr.!UT PREVENTION
The United States Issues Brief and
Practical Directions, for the Preven
tion of Smut in Oats Valuable In
formation for Farmers Which Will
Prevent Loss if Followed.
The averegae losses from smut
in oates are greater than those caus
ed by any other-preventable cereal
disease in the United States. Treat
ing the seed with hot water or with
formaldehyde solution . before sow
ing- is. an easy, cheap and effective
way of preventing this disease, lhe
latter method, which is the one most
available for general use, is here
briefly summarized." Both methods
are described in. detail tin Farmers1
Bulletin- 607, which will be sent free
on application to the Secretary of
Agriculture, Washington, 1). (J.
Mix the formalin (a commercial
preparation which is thirty-seven per
cent, formaldehyde by weight) with
water at the rate of one pound (a
little less than a pint) to 40 gallons
of water. The grain may be either
loosely inclosed in sacks or put loose
into a tub or vat with the solution.
Agitate the sacks or stir the loose
gTam occasionally so that the en
tire surface of every grain will be
thoroughly wet.' Instead of being
immersed . the seed oats may be
spread on a clean floor or canvass
and sprinkled with "the solution and
shoveled over during the process so
that they will be wet evenly as in the
other method. 1 Not over a gallon of
solution will be needed for every
bushel of dry grain. After sprink
ling, shovel ' the seed into pile, cover
it with sacks wet with the solution,
and allow it to stand for at least two
hours before spreading it out to dry.
Precaution: The oats may be seed
ed as soon as dry enough to run
through the drilL If the seed is
still moist, however, the drill must
be set to sow more to the acre than
if it is dry. The quantity which would
be sown may be determined by
measuring a eiven bulk before and
after treatment and figuring the pro
portion of increase. After treating
do not expose the seed to freezing
until is is thoroughly dry.
Do not allow the treated seed to
come into contact " with old Backs,
bins or machinery in which there may
be smut spores. If such must be us
ed, scald them or wash them first with
Formaldehyde soluthton. ,

One of the organizations in which
citizens of Wauseon may well take
pride is the High School Basket Ball
Team. In the first place they are as
fine a lot of High School boys as
may be found in this or any other
State in the union. Clean, manly.
fellows whose ability in this form of
athletics is well backed up by their
industry and prohciency in the class
room: They know how to play bas
ket ball and they also know how to
study and make the most of their
educational .opportunities.
In the second place they have made
a record thus tar tnis season that
reflects great credit upon the mem
bers of the team ana as well upon
their Coach, Mr. Sechrist. Under the
training of Mr. Sechrist these boys
have learned how to play a fast and
winning game without resorting to
any of the methods known in athletic
circles as "dirty", or to play the game
through -to. the end as "losers- cheer
fully and as gentlemen should.
The first game played was a "pre-

season Wauseon met deieat, tney
played a good game but owning to
new members on the team they lack

boys won the game by a score of 40

At Wauseon on January 7th, the
team from Montpelier were met and
defeated Montpelier making a, score
of 11 while Wauseon rolled up a
score of 43. In this game the Wau

outclassed the visiting team.
January 14th at Wauseon, the home
team met the Napoleon team again

of the season retrieved the defeat of

on this memorial occasion.
When the dinner hour was announc

with everything to satisfy the appetite
of humanity. There was present to
partake of this hospitality one hun
dred and twenty-eight, sixty-seven la
dies and sixty-one veterans and as
sociate members, who were abund
antly served. After the dinner hour
and the tables removed the following

occasion of this kinl:

number of the W. K. C. and G. A. R,
accepted this invitation and report
the talk given by Mr Altstetter most
pleasing and appropriate.

List of Articles That Are Much Need
ed At The Wauseon Hospital Re
cent Contributions That Are Ap
preciated By Trustees and Work
ing Force.
It is a well known fact that very
few hospitals are self supporting in
stitutions and the hospital, that makes
any financial profit whatever, is so
rare that it is safe to say it doesn't
exist. The Wauseon hospital is no
exception to the general rule and
would not now be in existence if it
were not for the contributions it has
received from time to time from in
dividuals and organizations; as it is
the drectors find it a difficult matter
to make receipts stretch out to meet
the expenses and a still more difficult
matter t provide all of the necessary
equipment. There are very few who
do not appreciate the great value of
this institution, and who would .not
be sorry to have it closed; for' these
reasons . those who can help ..will be
glad for the following list of articles
that are sorely needed at the hos
pital at the present time:
Mattresses one dozen.
'. Pillow cases two dozen. . '
Sheets ..two dozen.
Bath towels one and one half dozen.
Wash Clths one dozen.
Bed spreads one half dozen. - -
Operating gowns one half dozen.
Patients' gowns one dozen. :
Draw sheets to cover rubber sheets
two dozen. -
Window blinds or shades ten.
Cots two.
Mattresses three. -,
Recent donations to the hospital
are as follows:. v
Christian Sewing i Club, tray linen
and napkins, bandages.
Ladies -of Rebecca ' Lodge at Ted-
row, bed clothing and tray linen.
Mrs. Jennings of Wauseon, linens.
Graham Lyon of Wauseon,, book
cases and desk, books and dishes.
Catholic Ladies Sewing Club of
Wauseon,- towels, blankets, sheets
and wash cloths.
The trustees wish to extend their
appreciation to the above parties. If
it were not for the kindness of peo
ple in helping out the hospital in the
above manner and other ways, it could
not exist.
