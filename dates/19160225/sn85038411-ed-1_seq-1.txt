Time; Action in Congress
on Measure Unlikely
Washington. D. C., Feb. 25.—The j
fight in Congress over warning Ameri- •
sons off armed ships marked time to
day with the parliamentary situation!
and other developments favoring
President Wilson's position.
At an early morning conference with
House leaders the President was told j
that if resolutions to warn Americans j
could be forced to a vote now they j
would be passed in the House by a
majority of 1' 10 1.
President Wilson, nevertheless, firmly
and emphatically reiterated the un
yielding position he outlined last night
in his letter to Senator Stone. The
leaders went back to the House pre
pared to hold the situation in check
for the present at least.
Ex-Secretary Bryan's Influence came
openly into the fight to-day when ftcp
resentativc Bailey, of Pennsylvania,
gave out a telegram from Mr. Bryan
opposing the President's position and
supporting the agitation in Congress. ,
Eodgo With President
In the Senate Mr. I-odge, the rank- :
ing Republican of the foreign vela- j
tions committee, openly declared his I
support of the President's position. |
Senator Gore. Democrat, introdttced !
his resolution warning Americans, and
Senator Jones, Republican, introduced |
a resolution to require a break in
diplomatic relations to be referred to
Congress. There was no discussion.
The Cabinet discussed the situation j
thoroughly and officials said the mem- ,
hers were standing solidly behind the j
President.
Secretary Lansing said he had no
new information from Berlin, and i
while reports were discussed that Ger
many might postpone the operation
of the new submarine campaign, no
basis for them was disclosed.
The President was unshaken in his
position that Congress should take no
action embarrassing his contention
that the rights of Americans on the
seas must be upheld at any cost and
repeated what he had written last
night to Senator Stone.
The House leaders went away tell
ing the President nothing would be
done to-day but they ventured no pre
diction for the future. They admitted
that the situation was serious and
could not yet tell how far the senti
ment in Congress would be swayed by
the publication of the President's
views in his letter to Senator Stone.
May Postpone Campaign
When the conference was over,
Speaker Clark said there was a'rumor
that Germany would postpone the be
ginning of the new submarine cam
paign until April 1 or the middle of
.March. lie would not say whether
he got his information from the presi
dent.

ling a fresh break in values the wheat

Gang of Youths and Roys on
Hill May Re. Rack of
Incendiarism
That Lewis Blouch, 1427 Vernon
stret, who was arrested on Wednes
day on an attempted robbery charge,
is connected with the series of incen
diary fires on Allison Hill, is the be
lief of a number of residents of that
section of the city, who with private
detectives and watesmen have been
working on the case.
Although Blouch was arrested on a
charge of attempting to force ail en
trance to the 801 l Brothers Manufac
turing Company plant early Monday
morning, ho is being held on this
charge until the police can gather
enough evidence against him and a
number of accomplices, to charge
them with arson.
More Arrests to Follow
Although nothing could be learned
definitely /rom the authorities about
the arrest, or the plans in rounding
up the firebugs, it is rumored that
more arrests will be made within a
few days.
Early Monday morning J. 1-1.
Eowery, 1705 Derry street, watchman
at the 801 l plant, saw a man trying
to gain entrance to the place. The
intruder, according to the watchman,
was trying to enter the room in
which highly inflammable supplies are
stored. The person trying to gain
an entrance was frightened away by
Eowery, who then reported to the
police department. On this infor
mation, it is said, Blouch was arrested
and committed to jail after he was
taken before Alderman Hilton.
In case Hie police cannot produce
enough evidence at the bearing to
have Blouch held for court, a charge
of furnishing liquor to minors will be
brought against the prisoner.
Great secrecy was maintained in
making the arrest. Instead of plac
