WILSON POSITION
CLEARLY DEFINED
U. S. Covets Peace and Will
Preserve It at Any Cost Ex
cept Loss of Honor.
EXPECTS TO SUCCEED
Stone Urges Congress to Leave
President Free to Conclude
Diplomatic Negotiations.
Washington, Feb. 25 Congress met
today with President Wilson's position
on the question of armed merchant
men clearly defined
Members of congress had read the
president's letter to Senator Stone,
In which he declared, unequivocally,
that he would not consent to an
abridgment of tho rights of American
citizens in any respect
Honor of Nation Involved.
"The honor and self respect of the
nation is Involved," he said. "We
covet peace and shall preserve it at
any cost but the loss of honor."
The president's communication was
In response to a letter from the Mis
souri senator outlining the situation
at the capital where tor two day6
there had been a persistent demand
for action by congress warning Ameri
cans to keep off armed merchantmen.
The president 3aid that he had striv
en for peace and had succeeded and
that he had no doubt that he would
continue to succeed He expressed
confidence that tho explanations by
the central powers of the situation
which has arisen over their armed
merchantmen memoranda would soon
be received and that' the explanations
would put a different aspect upon
matters.
Confers With House and teaders.
President wilson ieiterated his op
position to any action in congress
warning Americans off armed ships
In a conferencp early today with Speak
er Clark, Majority Leader Kltchln
and Chairman Flood of the house for
eign aTfalrs committee, and they, in
turn, told the presidont that if such
a resolution were brought to a vote In
the house now it would pass by a ma
jority of two to one
The president was unshaken in his
position that congress should take no
action embarrassing his contention
that the rights of Americans on the
seas must be upheld at any cost and
ropeated what he had written last
night to Senator Stone
Sltuat;on Is Serious.
The houte leaders went away tell
ing tho president nothing would be
dono today, but they ventured no pre
dictions for the future. They admit
ted that the situation was serious ami
could not yet tell how far the senti
ment In congress would be swayed by
the publication of the president's
views jn his letter to Senator Stone.
When the conference was over
Speaker Clark said there was a rumor
that Germany would postpone the be
ginning of the new submarine cam
paign until April 1 or tho middle of
March He would not say whether
he got his information from the presi
dent. "The sum and substance of the con
ference Speaker Clark said, outside"
of an explanation made as to the tem
per of the house regarding the diplo
matic situation with Germany, and
some argument on both sides, is fully
set out in Senator Stone's letter to
the president and the president's let
ter to Senator Stone
House Attitude Explained.
"Wo explained to the presidont how
the house felt, in our Judgment I
told the president that this warning
resolution would carry two to one If
they ever got a chance for a vote.
Some enthusiastic gentlemen, I said,
thought it would carry three to one
"Of course thero was n great deal
of talk about International law regard
ing the rights or Americans on the
seas with the president At the con
clusion of the conference it was very
clear to all that the president stands
on his letter to Senator Stone.
Germany May Postppne Action.
"But the rumors which were dis
cussed that Germany may postpone
enforcement of the "new admiralty or
der to sink all armed ships from
March first, either to April 1st, or the
middle of March. I think the chancps
aro that Germany will postpone this
threatened performance on the high
seas. This will give more time for
consideration of this matter.
"We told the president that In the
event of such a. postponement all ac
tion In congress certainly would be
postponed. Meanwhile these resolu
tions would remain In statu quo."
In case Germany adheres to her or
der that the admiralty will be effective
March 1st, Speaker Clark said It
would be very difficult to get the
warning resolution out of a committee
for action and there was no way for
tho resolution to get before the house
today.
Impossible to Get Unanimous Vote.
"It is obvious that it will be Impos
sible to get unanimous consent of a
warning resolution. If the resolution
should be reported from the foreign
affairs commltte it would take its
place on tho calendar under the rules
committee should Interfere. Tho reso
lution Is no way privileged and it
would go to tho foot of the calendar.
That would mean we could not get
to it beforo July or August The only
remedy that if action is to bo had on
the resolution in tho near future is
the committee on rules ''
Thero 1b some doubt because of re-
cent developments as to the attitude
of that committee. A week ago, how
ever, members who were anxious that
the resolution be brought on the floor
were giveri little encouragement
Major Leader Kltchln and Represen
tative Flood declined to discuss what
took place.
President Meets Morgenthau.
President Wilson spent practically
the entire morning discussing phases
of the foreigu situation. In addition
to conferring with the houso leaders,
he saw HenryMorgenthau, American
ambassador to Turkey, and then took
up the International situation with tho
cabinet.
Administration officials said that
tho president's warning in his letter
to Senator Stope that the United
States must defend international law
from Infraction by any nation or
group of nations, was directed toward
all the European belligerents. The
government Is about ready, it was
said, to forward to Great Britain the
contraband note which has been un
der preparation for weeks and will
push vigorously the protests already
against seizure of American mails.
Senator Stone said today the report
that Germany migh postpone action
had come to some house leaders from
official sources but ho knew nothing
of it personally.
"I am not going to permit precipi
tation of debate today if I can help
it," Senator Stone declared.
It was understood that the United
States Is not Inclined to ask for a
postponement of the submarine policy,
because such a step might be con
strued as recognizing its vitality.
Many Telegrams Arrive.
The president was encouraged by a
large number of telegrams which
reached the White House today from
different parts of the country, sup
porting his stand. On the other hand,
letters urging passage of a resolution,
poured into the foreign office com
mittee. Supports of the agitatiou expressed
satisfaction over getting the presi
dent's view Into the open and general
ly agreed that they were willing- to
give him every opportunity to con
tinue diplomatic negotiations without
interference If there were no immedi
ate danger of war.
Jones Offers Resolution.
A resolution to express the sense of
the senate that any issue affecting
national honor should -be referred, be
fore decision, to congress, and that no
ultimatum should be sent to a foreign
power nor severance of diplomatic re
lations be permitted without refer
ence to congress, was introduced to
day by Senator Jones, Republican, of
Washington.
Foster Favors Caution.
Representative Foster of Illinois,
author of the warning resolution, fa
ored by the majority of the contend
ers for legislative aetfon, said he did
not think It should be rushed under
the present circumstances.
Representative McLemore of Texas,
who introduced the original warning
resolution, insisted that he would con
tinue to urge Chairman Flood to re
port it but admitted that he had no
hope of favorable action.
Senator Gore today Introduced his
concurrent resolution to warnAinerl
cans off armed ships and declared he
was all tho more enthusiastic in his
purpose in lew of the correspond
ence made public between the presi
dent and Senator Stone.
' In adopting my resolution thero
would be no abridgment of American
rights," he said "I purposely worded
it so as to express this idea."
Quick Work Stops Discussion.
Quick work by Speaker Clark pre
vented a threatened discussion in the
house soon after It convened.
Representative Hulbert of New
York, a Democrat, asked unanimous
consent for printing 5,000 copies of the
McLemore resolution. Republican
Leader Mann objected. Representa
tive Bailey of Pennsylvania, who is an
ardent supporter of the resolution,
and who had a telegram from William
J. Bryan supporting tho agitation,
shouted for recognition.
Clark Bangs His Gavel.
Speaker Clark banged his gavel, re
cognized Representative Fitzgerald
of New York and with Representative
Bailey still striving to be heard, the
house passed to other business. Bail
ey afterward denied that he was at
tempting to read the Bryan telegram.

PACIFIC COAST
Admiral Winslow Urges Need
of New Navy Yard on San
Francisco Bay.
EQUIP PUGET SOUND
Doubts Wisdom of Remodel
ling Mare Island Channel
Is Too Limited.
Washington, Feb. 25. The Pacific
coast needs more naval yards, Ad
miral Winslow told the house naval
committee today, notably a "big ship
yard" on San Francisco bay as wa
ter front, as channel limitations at
Mare Island seemed to preclude the
development of that yard for uses of
a modern fleet.
The Puget Sound yard, he thought
also should be equipped promptly to
handle big ships.
Tho number of submarines neces
sary to defend the Pacific coast
should be determined at the navy war
collego, the admiral said. Four shore
bases for submarines on the Pacific
coast as suggested by Rear Admiral
Grant, would be sufficient, Admiral
Winslow thought, but more than 4S
boats probably would be required.
There were other details, he said,
which he preferred to discuss behind
closed doors.
Admiral Winslow said he doubted
Hi wisrlnm nf trvlntr tr mnkp Mare
Island a first class navy yard, al
though a yard of that kind must be
maintained in San Francisco bay. Bat
tleships might grow to 50,000 tons, he
thought, and the limitations as to the
channel and water front at Mare isl
and seemed to foreclose the develop
ment of that yard to the use of a
modern fleet
Representative Stephens Insisted
that with an investment of $15,000,000
at Mare island, everything possible
should be done to bring the yard to
modern requirements. In any event,
ho said, a board of officers should de
termine the site of any new yard.
Tho admiral reiterated his state
ment that he did not regard tho Pa
cific fleet as efficient to faco an enemy.
