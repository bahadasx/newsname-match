ON THEIR PROPERTY FOR
NEW HOTEL.
J. S. Mullen, chairman of the hotel
committee, has written a number of
letters today to ascertain the prices
which will be asked for about our J
suitable sites for a new hotel in this
city. In following out the advice of
Joseph Iluekins, the committee will
obtain prices on a frontage of 75 feet.
After the prices have been obtained
there will be a meeting called of
the promoters, and they will select
what in their judgment is the best
proposition to accept, and then the
committee will go before the public
with the site located, the price of
the building to be construcled, and
will' have a concrete proposition to
place before every man before he is
asked to take any stock in the new
hotel project. It seems now that the
committee is working along a line

. W. JOHNSON DRAGGED BEHIND
RUNAWAY TEAM FOR MORE
THAN HALF A MILE AND STILL
LIVES.
J. V. Johnson, the ranchman, at
Milo, is a Christian. He is thorough
ly of the opinion that he owes his life
to some hidden power which he be
lieves is divine. A few days ago he
was dragged for more than a thou
sand yards by a pair of wild mules,
and he lived through it all and is able
to walk about and attend to his busi
ness. He was handling a wild team
itli a rope about the necks of the ani
mals. They broke away from him.
md his foot caught in a noose in the
end of the rope. He managed to hold
on to the rope with his hands and kept
his head from the ground during a
chase of more than half a mile. All
the time the mules were dragging
him, his weight was pressing against
tlit i i- throats and the animals became
so badly choked that they could not
run last, and he took advantage of
the opportunity to release his foot
from the noose.
L. H. Keller, who was with Mr.
Johnson on his ranch yesterdav. as
sured him that the Lord was either
saving him for some good purpose or
for a worse fate than to be dragged
to death by a wild mule.

the keynote of all speeches delivered
that the new law will work great
hardship on the small banks and
I h:it. the larger institutions will not j
be seriously affected, save by the
general business depression likely to
follow. John T. liailey of Albion
took the new measure to task, saying
it will bring ruin to the small banks
and bring on the crop lien system
that the southeastern states are try
ing to recover from. The large credit
merchants will thrive, he said, and
only the unscrupulous and shiftless
will prosper by the new law.
