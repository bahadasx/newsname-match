fWE KILLED IN N. P.
WRECK LAST SUNDAY
Twenty Injured—Cashmere Orchardist h
Among the Latter, Tho Not
Seriously Hurt
In a wreck on the Northern Pacific
atSouth Cheney, seventeen miles south
of Spokane, at 7:45 in the morning.
five passengers were killed. The
killed were all in the Walla Walla
sleeper bound for Spokane. The dead
are Professor Elton Fulmer, dean of
the Washington State College. Pull
mzn; all the others reside at Spokane;
I. J. Minnick, state oil inspector; J. J.
White, receiver of the Sammis monu
mental worksj L, M. Conroy, traveling
passenger agent of the N. P. Ry.; B.
L. Berkev, traveling salesman. Three
are quite seriously injured and a score
of others slightly, among them F. T.
Spiller, a prominent orchardist of Cash
mere, well known here. The Burling
ton train was at the station when the
North Coast Limited dashed into the
rear end telescoping the sleeper. The
blame ii laid on the rear flagman, who
failed to go far enough back to stop
the encoming train which was known
to be following. A dense foe prevailed
at the time. Both trains were using
the Spokane, Seattle and Portland
track. A dead-head chair car hitched
onto the rear of the sleeper was driven
three-fourths of its length into the
sleeper, where all the fatalities occured.
Worst Winter in Hundred Years
Charles Grant, a resident of Central
Wwbington (or 31 years, writes to the
Pateros Reporter from Methow that this
is the worst winter in his experience.
He says: "I see in your last issue
that you say this is the worst winter in
26 years. I have been here for 28
years, and in the Inland Empire 31
winters, and this one for depth ol snow
beats them all. The winter of 1889
--90 was severe as no one had feed, 95
per cent of all the stock in the county
dying of starvation, still the snow was
only 36 inches deep. The next hard
winter was in 1902 03, when the show
was 44 inches deep on the 17th day of
March, but only a few head of stock
died as hay was shipped in from Yak
ima on the steamboats. The present
winter beats them by 16 inches, there
being 60 inches of snow on the level
on my ranch on the Bth day of Febru
ary. By the record kept in Spokane,
this is the deepest snow in the Inland
Empire since 1816, just 100 years
•go."

Gun Club Meeting
The Gun Club held its second shoot
of the season on Sunday last. On ac
count of the snow and the dullness of
the day, ihe light was very poor, and
as a result the scores were barely up to
the best average. The principal fea
ture of the day was a luncheon to
which visitors as well as the club mem
bers were made welcome. The lunch
was purveyed by J. A. Hearst who,
with the able assistance of Win Faulk
ner, did the serving and saw to it that
the thirty-two members and guests
were thoroly enjoying the good things
set before them. One young man was
heard to remark that he was "satisfied
that there was a good deal of buncombe
about no cooking being like mother's."
Did everyone have a good time?
Well, just ask Mayor Day.
THRU TRAINS ON G. N.
AfTER 23 DAYS TIE-UP
Cool Nights of First Three Days of Week
Favorable to Railroads—No
Slides of Consequence
To tke general public no less than
to the railroad company the resumption
of train service last Wednesday morn
ing was a great relief. Leavenworth is
a general terminal point and the free
operation of trains is no small part of
the life of the town, not to mention the
inconvenience in the mail, passenger
and freight service caused by a com
plete cessation of traffic for three weeks.
Witii the exception of last Saturday the
route to the east has been open all the
time, tho we only had one train carry
ing mail and passengers each day.
Crab creek, which caused the railroad
company trouble between Leavenworth
and Spokane, has run out and is not
likely to cause further interruption.
Because of the roundabout way of
getting freight by way of Spokane and
the Columbia river route, little business
was done last month with Seattle and
other Puget Sound cities. Fresh Cali
fornia vegetables and fruit usually comes
from Seattle by express and during the
tie-up some inconvenience was suffered
on account of the lack of these table
luxuries by the housewives of Leaven
worth the past month. Beyond this
Leavenworth life kept on a pretty even
keel. Fuel shortage never has caused
any apprehensions here. If one can
not get coal there is always an abun
dance of wood in easy reach, tho the
price was much higher than in the fall
before winter set in.
The season has so far advanced that
it seems inconceivable that further seri
ous interruption in the train service
need be apprehended from now on.
Of course there will be more slides
when the weather turns warm again,
but they will not be so large or so fre
quent.
Entertained in Honor of Visitor
Mrs. D. C. Town entertained a
number of friends Monday afternoon in
honor of Mrs. R. E. DeLancey, of
Cansas City, Mo. Beside the guest of

The Higher Up the Valley You Go the Bigger and Better the Apples Grow
Leavenworth, Wash., Friday, February 25, 1916
WASHINGTON POTATOES
AT NEW YORK BANQUET
1800 Shipt From Yakima and Palouse
None of Which Weighed Less
Than Four Pounds
More than eighteen hundred baked
potatoes grown in the Palouse and Yaki
ma countries and other parts of the in
land empire were served at the third
annual banquet of the Far Western
Travelers Association in the Astor hotel.
New York, on Monday night of last
week. None of the potatoes weighed
less than four pounds. Opened and
crowned with a cube of butter they
provided a novel scene. More than
1000 women, chiefly the wives and
sweethearts of the guests, viewed the
banquet from two balconies above the
great ball room. The asjociation is
composed of men who make three or
more journeys to the northwest each
year.
For three days before the banquet
the potatoes were exhibited in an auto
mobile that was run from the battery to
ISOth street, to the Bronx and the
borough of Brooklyn. Banners on the
car announced that the potatoes were
grown on the Northern Pacific lines.
So great was the interest that traffic
was congested six times by pedestrians,
making necessary the services of the
police in opening a way. On each oc
casion officers demand a display of the
permit given for the exhibit.
Among those who ate and discussed
the inland empire potatoes were Gov
ernor Whitman and Mayor Mitchell.
Besides Mr. Ude and Mr. Titus, D. S.
Tobias of Seattle, assistant commissary
agent, and other officials of the North
ern Pacific were present.
Peshastin fruit Grower Died
Yesterday
Ernest W. Hatch, a well known and
highly respected apple grower, died
Wednesday from the effects of typhoid
fever. Besides his wife he leaves a
daughter, Hazel, aged 17 years. The
family removed from Boston, Mass.,
three years ago to Peshastin. Mr.
Hatch was borne in Maine. The re
mains will be shipt to Boston for burial.
Last Link in Scenic Highway
At a meeting of the county com
missioners of Snohomish county this
week it was decided to complete her
six miles of the highway which falls in
that county. The work will com
mence as early as possible. While the
distance is very short compared to what
King county completed last year at a
cost of 8150,000 the six miles'work is
very heavy and will cost much money.
Death of f. W. Crum
Mr. Crum died at his ranch, sixteen
miles up the Columbia river from We
natchee. He was quite well known
here where he often visited some two
years ago, when he became interested
in a quicksilver mine located on Nig
ger creek iv the Blewett mining dis
trict. He was also interested in a cop
per mine near Butte, Montana. He
was a victim of Bright's disease. He
left a widow and three children. He
left a fortune estimated at 875,000.
Idaho Mines Add $39,000,000 to the
Nation's Wealth
In his annual report for the year
1915, a copy of which has just been
received by The Spokesman-Review,
State Mine Inspector Robert N. Bell,
of Idaho, gives the total gross value of
the metal contents of the ore and bul
lion shipped from that state in 1915 as
approximately 839,000,000, of which
he says, probably over 89,000,000 was
accumulated as net profits to the op
erators.
The chicken dinner given at the
church by the Congregational women
last evening was generously patronized.
A very interesting musical program was
rendered.
Fire Destroys Cashmere Home
The seven-room home of Frank j
Meecham, with nearly all the furniture,
was destroyed last Sunday morning.
Mr. and Mrs. Meecham had been out
visiting friends and returned late, built
a fire and hung some wet clothing near
the stove to dry before retiring. When
they were awakened by the fire it had
gained such headway it was impossible
to extinguish it. Much of the furni
ture was lost. Loss on the building is
estimated at $1700 with 8300 insur
ance.
CHEMICAL WONDERS IN
NATURE'S LABORATORY
It Works Overtime to Supply All the
Wants of the Human Race—A
Fascinating Science
The simplest living room in the
most modest home is, in the light of
science, a storehouse of chemical won
ders, according to Dr. Robt. E. Rose, of
the chemistry faculty in the University
of Washington. He pulled such a room
to pieces, figuratively speaking, for the
benefit of an audience at one of the
popular science lectures recently, an
alyzing woodwork, furniture, tapestries,
rugs, windows and ornamentations, and
then put them back together in terms
of chemical formula.
One particular adornment on which
Dr. Rose picked was a little imitation
ivory picture frame of the variety pur
chasable at any department store.
"it is made from cotton, nitric acid
camphor," said the expert. "The first
came from the fields of the southern
states. Like wood, it was made from
air, sunshine and water. Nitric acid
comes from South America, where it is
found as a salt known as Chili saltpetre.
In a country where it never rains, in
some strange manner this salt got itself
formed. In order to get the nitric
acid from it, it is treated with oil of
vitriol and sulphuric acid, which in
turn is made of roasted pyrites, steam
and oxygen. The cellulose.when acted
on by the nitric acid, forms collodion,
and this is mixed with camphor which
comes from the forests of Formosa.
The mixture is pressed and forms cel
luloid.
"Think of the many things that co
to the making of that picture frame.
Think of the human beings who have
contributed their share of work that it
may adorn the room: Negroes picking
cotton in the moist air of the fertile
fields of the South; Chilian natives
mining saltpetre in the arid uplands of
the southern continent; Japanese tap
ping trunks of great laurels in the trop
ical forests of Formosa; Slavs or Latins
or Norsemen digging the pyrites from
the earth in the temperate zones of
this continent. All these have played
their part, each working at his appoint
ed task, preparing the crude materials,
the finishing of which is done in some
factory in charge of the great exponents
of science, the northern races."
Dr. Rose spoke of the efforts being
made by the Germans, since the war
began, to find substitutes for cotton,
and in this connection he displayed
samples of cloth made from wood, in
cluding one deceiving bit of "silk,"
which scientists have succeeded in
making either from wood or cotton.
Large Crowd at Library Ball
The Library benefit ball given on
the evening of Washington's birthday
was a great success both socially and
financially. The hall was attractively
decorated in red and green, hatchets
and cherries being much in evidence,
with the American flag floating over all.
The women of the library committee,
dressed in colonial costume, aided in
every way to make the evening a pleas
ant one.

SLIDE WRECKS ROTARY
AND DERAILS ENGINE
Four Miles Up the Canyon Last Satur
day—Only One of the Crew
Slightly Injured
An engine crew and rotary snow
plow with some fifty men engaged in
clearing out a monster slide near the
G. N. electric power phnt, four miles
up the canyon, had a narrow escape
last Saturday about 11 o'clock. When
the news was flashed here that a rotary
snow plow had been carried into the
Wenatchee river and an engine thrown
oS the track by a slide, railroad men
and the public, knowing that between
fifty and a hundred men were working
at the same place, jumped to the con
clusion that more victims had bean
added to the slide troubles of the Great
Northern railroad. An hour later news
was brought to town that no one was
seriously injured. Lloyd Durand was
only slightly hurt in Jumping off the
rotary as it went down over the bank.
The rotary was badly wrecked 1 and the
engine turned over on its side and
slightly damaged.
Coinage by I). S. Mints
This government coins from $50,
--000,000 to 860,000,000 into gold and
silver coins each year in the three gov
ernment mints located in Philadelphia,
Denver and San Francisco. This
means that approximately 150,000,000
coins are made. Their weight and
fineness are provided for by law. To
check up the coins as to the legal
standards is the work of the U. S. As
say Commission. This commission is
appointed annually by the president
and C. C. Dill, of the sth congres
sional district of this state, was the
only member of congress selected this
year.
One out of every thousand gold
coins and one out of every 2,000 sil
ver coins are taken from the mints as
they are made. These are placed in
sealed packages to be weighed and
melted by the commission for the pur
pose of determining whether or not the
coins are up to standard. The com
mission, consisting of eighteen men,
reports to the president the results of
its work in testing these coins. It
met on Wednesday, February 9, and
worked for two days.
Only once in recent years have any
of the coins been below the standard.
In 1904 some gold coins made in the
Denver mint were found to be lacking
in the necessary amount of gold.
All of the coins were immediately
called in and recoined and the coiner
removed from office. This year all
coins were found fully up to the re
quired standards. Should coins below
standard come into the possession of
foreign governments the standard value
of American money would immediately
be affected, so that these annual re
ports of the assay commission are
awaited with great interest in all of the
government mints.
At the Philadelphia mint more than
8400,000,000 in gold coins were in
the vault when the commission in
spected it. The man who is in com
plete charge of the room where the
bullion bars are kept is under $4,000
bond. He had 815,000,000 worth of
bullion bars there when they went thru
the mint. Most of it was in real gold
bricks worth 810,000 each.
The men who melt and pour the
gold and silver into bars preparatory to
rolling them into thin strips from which
are cut the coins, are under 82,000
bonds each. Every night they sweep
up from the floor cf the workshop flakes
of gold which are worth from $300 to
$400. The superintendent who has
complete control of the mint is bonded
for only $100,000. Thus the integ
rity of the government employes in the
1 mints is far more important than the
| amounts of their bonds.
However, the system keeps a rather
complete check upon the employes
daily. AH gold and silver is weighed
oat to them in the morning and
Our Job Printing
department is com
plete. If you want
High Class printing
at reasonable prices,
come to this office.
$1.50 Per Year
weighed back in the evening. To
these workmen gold and silver seem
to be no more valuable so far as han
dling them is concerned, than iron is
to those who handle it, except that the
employes of the mint are careful not to
scatter the metal about, because of the
difficulty of collecting it at the close of
the day. Only once in recent years
has a workman actually stolen any gold
or silver He only succeeded in get
ting away with 8800 before he was
discovered. All of the money was re
covered later.
MILLIONS Of IMMIGRANTS
AFTER THE WAR IS OVER
Mostly From Southern Europe—Many
Will Leave This Country for
Eurype After War
Twenty million men who have been
living in the trenches in Europe and
have developed the spirit of democracy
will become restless under old restric
tions after the war and wish to come to
this country, declared Frederick C.
Howe, United States commissioner of
immigration, in an address before the
national democratic club, last Saturday,
in New York.
The largest influx of immigrants, Mr.
Howe pointed out, may be expected
from Russia and the Balkan states,
while Great Britain and Austria-Hungary
also will have trouble keeping their
people. He said we might also expect
many from other countries whose busi
ness has been ruined by the war.
There is rapidly developing in the
United States, according to Mr. Howe,
what he termed a "labor vacuum" and
we must be prepared for the exodus of
many foreigners now here, who will re
turn to Europe at the end of the war to
learn what has become of their rel
atives.
