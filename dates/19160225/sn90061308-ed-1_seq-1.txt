MRS. JOHN LOPP PASSES AWAY
Mrs. Mary Frances Lopp, wife of
the late John Lopp, passed peacefully
away Wednesday night, February 23
at 9:25 o'clock. Her death was caused
by pneumonia from which she had
been ill for a week.
Funeral services will be held at the
Methodist Episcopal Church at 2:30
o'clock, Friday afternoon, the pastor,1
Rev. J. F. King, officiating. Inter-j
ment will be made in the family lot
1n Oakdale cemetery. I
The services at the cemetery will be
under the auspices of Aloha Chapter
O. E. S., and the body will be escort
ed by the L. A. to O. R. C.
Mrs. Lopp was born at Humans
ville, September 3, 1845 - and lived
there all of her early ife. She was
married to John Lopp in July, 1865
Late winter and early spring fur
nish the best opportunities for plan
ning to make improvements in farm
home surroundings and to plant
shrubs. Probably bridalwreath, or
Spirea Van Houttei, has proved satis
factory to more people than any other
single yard ornament and it may well
be included in the order which it is
about time to send to the nurseries, if
a neighbor cannot supply what you
want. The common name "bridal
wreath" is applied to several varieties
of spirea, so in ordering it is best to
specify the variety. Bridalwreath is
inexpensive, has abundant bloom and
fine foliage. It improves with age, is
graceful in form, free from insect
pests, easy to transpJant, and conspic
uous without being too much so.
As a plant to stand alone, it is un
excelled. Bending under its pile of
snowlike flowers for weeks in the
spring, it needs no other shrub in the
came clump to give a long-flowering
period. ' Banked against the founda
tion of the house, it supports and
rounds out the architecture and con
ceals what is usually an ugly founda
tion or bare corner. For a hedge, it
has no superior. Planted in a straight -row,
three feet apart in the row, it
needs no pruning and comparatively
little attention. Thus it supplies a
fencelike border, ornamental, perma
nent, dense and economical, which
gives an air of privacy and refinement
to any yard. It is a plant made for
every man. The millionaire can find
no better and the tenant can afford it
as well as a package of flower seeds.
