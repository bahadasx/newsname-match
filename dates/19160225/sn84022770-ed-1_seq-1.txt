HARMONY REIGNS AT
DEMOCRATIC MEETING
SESSIONS OF STATE CENTRAL
COMMITTEE PAVE WAY FOR
COMING CAMPAIGN.
Thurston county will have 16 dele
gates to the Democratic state con
vention which is to be held at North
Yakima May 2d and which 1,039 del
egates In all will attend, the basis
of apportionment, date and conven
tion city having been determined at
the meeting of the Democratic state
central committee in Everett last
Saturday, the most successful, har
monious and satisfactory session of
the committee in the history of the
Democratic party in this state. State
Chairman J. B. Fogarty presided.
Whatever factional differences
there may have been were smoothed
out at this conference, which was at
tended by state committeemen from
31 of the 39 counties of the state
and many other party leaders, and
the banquet tendered the visitors in
the evening by the Snohomish coun
ty Democrats was attended by more
than 300 persons. The committee
sessions and the banquet were char
acterized by the greatest enthusiasm
as well as the spirit of harmony, and
Democrats generally have since
heartily approved of the action of
the state committee.
Krtvor Lister anil Turner.
As the result of this conference, it
was the consensus of opinion regard
ing the coming senatorial and guber
natorial campaigns, that Governor
Lister should be the sole candidate
for the Democratic nomination for
that office and former Senator George
Turner of Spokane the party candi
date for the senatorial nomination.
Supreme Judge Chadwick of this
city, whose many friends throughout
the state had urged his candidacy,
withdrew in favor of Judge Turner.
The committee meeting waa one of
the most harmonious held in the
state and the position in which the
Democratic party now finds itself
with reference to state politics is
much different than that in which
the Republicans are involved, with
two candidates for United States sen
ator a third likely to appear at
any moment, and half a dozen candi
dates for governor. Factional differ
ences were settled before the com
mittee meeting was called and in
bringing about this desirable state of
affairs, Attorney P. M. Troy of this
city, state committeeman from
Thurston county, played a leading
part.
A short sharp struggle developed
when the old guard of the party, the
J. B. Fogarty following, made a last
stand to elect Fogarty as national
committeeman, through the simple
expedient of allowing the national
delegates selected at the state con
vention to name a national commit
teeman when the national conven
tion met. Martin Maloney of Colfax,
supported by D. J. Williams of Pierce
county, opened and led the fight.
Trenholme of King and Troy of
Thurston fought the proposal suc
cessfully, winning by a vote of 19 to
12. This was the only indication of
a struggle.
Biu<ia of Apportionment.
The selection of delegates to the
state convention will be left in the
hands of the various county commit
tees to determine. No date was fixed
for holding the county conventions.
This will be determined by the cen
tral committees of the county. The
delegates present, however, inform
ally agreed that the open caucuses
would be called in the counties and
county delegates selected in them.
The apportionment was made on a
basis of three at large from each
county and one for each 100 votes
cast in 1914 for Judge W. W. Black
for the United States senate.
The Democratic party workers
who attended the committee meeting
and banquet declared that the po
litical situation in the Republican
party in the atate is such that the
Democrats have one of the best op
portunities In years to swing a strong
tlcKet through the campaign succesa
fully.
Three hundred Democrats, with a
sprinkling of Republicans and Pro
gressives, attended the banquet Sat
urday evening when the opening
guns of the Democratic state and na
tional campaign in this state were
flred. The speakers included State

County ('nils for Hids to Complete
Johnston Road Structure.
♦
Completion of the famous bridge
across the Black river on the Dave
Johnston road from Mima to Little
Rock, built four or Ave years ago at
a cost of $9,000, never finished and
never used, was authorized by the
county commissioners this week, and
County Auditor Annie Gaston was
directed to issue the call for bids.
Plans and specifications for the
work, which it is expected will cost
at least $2,000 or $3,000, have been
prepared by the county engineer.
The principal part of the work will
be on the 1,500-foot approach,
which, through a blunder, was con
structed four feet too low and will
have to be raised that distance.
BIG UNION MILLS
PLANT TO RESUME
WILL EMPIjOY 250 MEN IN MILL
AND CAMP—TO PUSH SALE OK
"TUNG-LOK" SILOS,
With its crew of men already en
gaged and work at the logging camp
started this week, the big plant of
the Union Lumber company at Union
Mills will resume operations about
March 1, according to an announce
ment made this week by Manager
Judd Gre'enman, and 250 men will
be employed in the mill and camp.
The company just closed an order
with the government for 1,300,000
feet of lumber for use in the Manis
tee harbor improvement, at Grand
Rapids, Mich., and the mill will be
put right at work on this order. The
market situation is very encouraging,
according to Mr. Greeman, inquiries
are frequent and prices higher, so
that he expects the mill to be oper
ated steadily for an indefinite period.
It has been shut down since last July,
though the planing mill was operated
for a short time last fall.
Crew Larger Than Usual.
The employment of 250 men will
give the company the largeßt crew It
has worked, the previous average
having been 200. It is changing its
log supply base from the district pre
viously worked, some eight miles
from the mill and a mile and a half
from Yelm, to the St. Martin's col
lege tract north of Lacey and will log
that section until all the timber is
removed.
The mill, which has the reputa
tion of being as finely equipped plant
as there is in the state, being elec
trically driven with individual motors
on each machine, Is in first-class con
dition. Only one other mill in the
state is similarly equipped, the new
Weyerhaueser mill at Everett.
The company proposes to feature
its silo-manufacturing department
this year and expects to enlarge it
with the installation of new ma
chinery. Under the direction of R.
C. Pierson as sales manager, it will
also inaugurate an aggressive sales
campaign in Washington, Oregon and
Idaho, to place its "Tung-Lok" silos
on the farms of the Pacific North
west.
Formerly Shipped East.
Up until last fall the company did
not undertake the sale of its silos in
this territory, but shipped them into
the Mississippi valley states, from
Minnesota and the Dakotas into
southern Kansas, but quite a num
ber of "Tung-Loks" have been placed
on farms in Thurston county and
other Western Washington districts
during the winter months, and the
company proposes to push the sale of
them in the three northwest states
still more vigorously during the
coming months. The company is one
of the largest manufacturers of silos
on the Pacific Coast and is meeting
with great success In Introducing the
"Tung-Lok" into the northwest
states.

AMATEURS GET WIRELESS
Statement Relayed From Rock Island
to Governor Ernest Lister-
First Test of Kind.
Relayed by amateur wireless sta
tions from the government arsenal at
Rock Island, 111., a message from
Colonel Nichols of the United States
army was caught by two local wire
less operators, Frank Ferris and
Ernest Robbins, at midnight Monday
and conveyed to Governor Lister and
Mayor Mottman. The message was
sent here from La. Grande, Ore., being
received by the powerful station at
St. Martin's college, Lacey, and then
transmitted to Olympia.
The test was the first of its kind
ever attempted in the United States.
The message read as follows: "Ama
teur Relay League, from Rock
Island 111., to His Excellency, the
Governor, Olympia, Wash.:
"Democracy requires that a people
who govern themselves shouM be
armed and prepared to defend them
selves.
"COLONEL NICHOLS."

Standard, also lives on the Eastside.
SLIPPERY GULCH OPENS,
"SUM" TELLS THE OOPE
Elks' "High Jinks" Scheduled (or
Friday and Saturday Night*—
High Old Times.
"Slippery Gulch," the Elks' "High
Jinks" mining camp entertainment,
where the days of the "wild and
woolly" are being repeated, was
opened to the public Thursday night
and everybody had a great time.
News of its various stunts spread
quickly and prompted an interesting
and amusing argument Friday morn
ing between two youngsters, who for
convenience will be dubbed "Slim"
and "Slats."
Shelly Mowell was passing and
stopped to listen to the "explicit" in
formation "Skinny" was handing to
Slats.
Slats started the conversation
with: "Say, Slim, what's this ere
Slippery Gulch stuff the Elks are
pulling off over underneath their
lodge rooms? Is it & moving picture,
a play or what?"
Slim answered thusly: "Oh, you
make me tired, you big lantern-Jawed
flathead! Ain'tcher wise to this
stunt? Well, I'll skid yer in on the
ground floor. It's a sure nufT minin'
camp, where murderin', lynchin',
gamlin' and dancin' and all the other
'49 stunts are pulled off, by the livin'
Jinks."
Slats —"How'd you get so wised
up?"
Slim —"Me? Why, me big brud
der, who is a Elk, has bee« spillin'
all kinds of junk around the house
about what the bunch pulled off last
night. He says there's stores of all
kinds, Chinese washee house? pony
express, saloon, hotel, gamblin' den.
dance hall, and more fun than a
Fourth of July celebration. So you
had better wise up yer pa and ma and
tell 'em to get their '49 'rags' ready
and rest up so they kin step some on
these last two nights. On the level,
it's the howlin'est time ever seen. I
hope pa lets me go. If he don't, I'm
goin' to sneak off and try to 'beat it'
into the 'joint.' Get me, Steve?"
Mowell smiled, for he knew from
this sample of enthusiasm that all the
"fun folks" of this town and sur
rounding country will be there with
both feet Friday and Saturday nights
and help make this affair the biggest
event of the year.
Plmim Another Oil Well.
Tenino and vicinity are again ex
cited over the announcement thai
drilling will begin immediately on an
oil well near Bucoda. Thomas Mc-
Ginn, a prospector who has been in
that section for over a year, has re
turned from Spokane and announces
he has succeeded in raising sufficient
finances to put the well through. No
company will be Incorporated, Tenino
and Spokane capital backing McGinn
The well will be drilled on a spot se
lected by McGinn after careful search
for the beat surface indications.
DIES FROM APOPLEXY
A. E. Stanford Expired Suddenly
Thursday Noon—Funeral Sunday.
Stricken with apoplexy just as he
entered his home, A. E. Stanford, 67
years old, a resident of Olympia since
1892, died suddenly Thursday noon.
He had been local representative of
the Northern Pacific railway during
his 24 years' residence in Olympia
and was widely known throughout
this section of the state. For the last
three years he had been in charge of
the local freight depot of the North
ern Pacific, but prior to that, before
the railroad's local business bad re
quired the services of two agents, he
had had entire charge of the local
station.
Mr. Stanford had been complain
ing of ill health for a couple of
weeks, but his ailment had not been
considered serious. He is survived
by the widow and three children,
Mildred, James N., former deputy
county treasurer and now connected
with the state land office, and Mil
dred. He was a member of St. John's
Episcopal church and of the local
lodge of Elks.
The funeral will take place at the
home at 9 o'clock Sunday morning,
Rev. C. S. Morrison of the Episcopal
church officiating. The body will be
sent to Tacoma for cremation.
SOUTHSIOE HOME BURNS
DOWN, EVERYTHING LOST
Swan House, Occupied by Miller Fam
ily, Destroyed by Fire Wednes
day Night.
Fire which it is believed started
from a heating stove in the living
room, gained such headway before it
was discovered that it completely de
stroyed the Swan house at 1533 Main
street Wednesday night in a spectac
ular blaze that threatened for a time
to spread to adjoining property. The
house was occupied by George Miller
and family, who were all down street
at the time, and the contents and the
house itßelf were a total loss. The
house was valued at about $2,500,
upon which there was SI,OOO insur
ance, while Miller's loss was about
$1,500, with no insurance, the poli
cies having lapsed jußt recently.
When the fire was discovered,
shortly after 8 o'clock, the whole in
terior of the house was ablaze and
the flames were breaking out from
the front and sides. A large crowd
soon gathered. Neighbors tried to
break into the place to save some
furniture, but were unable to, and
when the department arrived first
attention was given to saving nearby
property. Everything in the house
was destroyed, including clothing.
The Miller family, in which there
are seven children, one just two
months old, had gone down town in
the early evening, to the Reed block,
where Mr. Miller, who was formerly
manager of Doane's cafe, is prepar
ing to start a new restaurant, and
they are at a loss to explain how the
fire started. The property belongs
to Mrs. Stella M. Swan of Tucson,
Ariz., widow of James Swan, who
formerly lived in Olympia.
The Miller family spent Wednes
day night at the home of Mr. and
Mrs. Frank C. Owings, while friends
and neighbors generously co-operated
in assisting them to get a new start.

GILLIES GI'ILTY AGAIN.
Deposed Claim Agent Convicted of
Grand Larceny After Second Irial.
Afer deliberating for nearly 24
hours, during most of which time
only one juror dissented, the jury in
the local superior court which heard
the second trial of J. F. Gillies in
connection with the Industrial insur
ance frauds brought in a verdict of
guilty Thursday afternoon. On his
first trial, Gillies, deposed claim agent
of the commission, was convicted of
forgery.
Gillies will not be tried again,
though he faces another charge in
connection with Frank Stone and
Gene Kearns, and the scene of the
state fraud cases will now shift to
Tacoma where Arthur (Monk)
Young, a former saloonkeeper of that
city, will be tried for cashing some
of the fraudulent warrants when, it
is alleged, he knew they were fraud
ulent. Kearns' trial will follow in
the local court.
LOCAL FIRM MAKES
NEW DUK-W
OLYMPIA BREWING COMPANY TO
PUT CEREAL BEVERAGE ON
MARKET MARCH 1.
"Lact," a new type of non-alco
holic beverage, made from cereals
by what is known as the lactic pro
cess Just recently patented by East
ern scientists, of which the local
firm is the sole manufacturing
licensee for this state, will be put on
the market about March 1 by the
Olympia Brewing company under the
name of the Olympia Beverage com
pany. The company's half-million
dollar plant at Tumwater, which has
been shut down since the state went
"dry" the first of the year, will be
used in the manufacture of the new
drink.
No malted barley or other malted
grains are used in "Lact," the pro
cess, according to Peter O. Schmidt,
president of the company, being a
new scientific development which
uses the natural properties of the
grains in making the beverage.
"The product is not like 'near
beer,' with Its heavy, unfermented
malt barley and taste," Mr. Schmidt
said this week in discussing the new
drink, "but is a beverage of a light
and refreshing character, with a zest
that is not possessed by 'near-beer'
or similar products. It is highly en
dorsed by health and pure fod au
thorities.
"In the lactic process the heavier
extractive substances from the ce
reals are converted and highly digest
ed, and this action, together with a
pleasant lactic snap or zest acquired
in the process makes Lact a de
sirable, healthful and refreshing
beverage. With this product, as in
Olympia beer, the ideal properties of
our company's famous 'Tumwater'
artesian spring—'lt's the Water'—is
of greatest value in the production
of a superior article.
"The Olympia Beverage company
is the sole manufacturing licensee
under this process in the state of
Washington. The company is also
preparing to manufacture on a much
larger scale Fruju and Frupop in its
fruit products department, as the sale
of Fruju in particular has been
largely increased since the first of
the year and will be extended to
other territory."
"Lact" will be put on the market
in kegs, to be sold as draught, and
also in bottles, and in this latter
form it will be handled by grocers
and dealers generally. The company
is preparing to double the "Loju"
output at its Salem, Ore., plant this
year, and has other plans in view for
its local plant, in addition to the
manufacture of "Lact."

FOR WATER SYSTEM
EFFECTS COMPROMISE WITH
COMPANY AM> CITY COUNCIL
AUTHORIZES ACQUISITION.
Having effected a compromise with
the owners of the local waterworks
plant to take it over at a price of
$102,600, requiring the company to
pay $13,000 in back taxes and its
Swantown box sewer assessment of
$1,700, and to return the SI,OOO
trust fund covering water meter
charges, Mayor Geo. A. Mottman
called a special meeting of the city
council Friday morning when the de
tails of the transaction were author
ized. The bonds have been sold to
John E. Price & Co., Seattle bond
brokers. The ordinances and resolu
tions involved appear among the
"City Legal Notices" on another
page.
The city expects to take the plant
over on or about next Wednesday,
March 1, according to a statement
issued by the mayor. The price
agreed upon in the compromise 1b
$14,000 more than the verdict
allowed by a jury in the Pierce coun
ty superior court In the condemna
tion suit decided in April last year,
but it ends all litigation with the
company. The company's appeal
from this verdict is still pending in
the state supreme court.
The offices of the company will be
| moved immediately to the city hall,
j and the management of the water
plant put in the hands of a com
mittee composed of Councilmen
Tauger, chairman. Talcott and Ram
berg, C. A. Harmony, manager of the
system for the last four years, re
tiring. This will mean a saving,
Mayor Mottman says, of $225 a month
"right off the bat." The city will
collect the March water bills.
Ends Long Fight.
This compromise and Its approval
by the city council closes the light
for the acquisition of the waterworks
which Mayor Mottman has conducted
since his first campaign for (election
in the fall of 1912, and is heralded
with much Joy in administration
circles. In this period there have
been three special elections, the last
being held last December when a
bond issue of SIIO,OOO was author
ized, and various points involved
have been passed upon by the su
preme court, the $90,000 issue pre
viously authorized having been de
clared invalid in one instance.
In the measures adopted by the
council this morning, the bid of John
E. Price & Co. of par and accrued In
terest to March 1 is accepted, the
I city treasurer is authorized to deposit
$102,600 with the Pierce county
court as payment to the company,
and a special "Water Fund" is
created, from which the treasurer is
authorized to pay $4,242 to the Seat
tle law firm of Baliinger, Battle, Hul
bert & Shorts and the New York firm
of Caldwell, Masslich & Reed for
legal services, and $4,994.48 for ex
penses incurred in connection with
the acquisition of the system. Upon
this authority, Mrs. Lona Smith, the
treasurer, has issued a call for most
of the general and current expense
fund warrants issued on the water
works project.
Mayor Mottman's statement con
cerning this action is quite lengthy.
After discussing the litigation of the
past year, he declares that "the
people of Olympia have lost since
March between $15,000 and $20,000
net in water rentals by being kept
out of control and possession of the
water works and the income there
from," and then goes on to say:
Reason for Compromise.
"This intolerable condition was
liable to continue for another year or
longer, because there is no end to lit
igation under our system of Juris
prudence and the people were losing
about SSO a day by being deprived of
control of the water plant. With
these conditions confronting us the
administration came to the conclu
sion that if a fair way and common
ground for compromise could be ar
rived at between the many conflict
ing interests in control of the water
works and the city, and possession be
had at once for the city and a good
title secured, stopping all further ex
pense and litigation, it would be good
business for the city, even if it had
to pay more than the jury awarded,
because the income would take care
of it in a very few months. Pursucuit
to this spirit a compromise was
