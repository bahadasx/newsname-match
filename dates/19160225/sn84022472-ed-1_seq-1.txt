planation by Supt. S. R. Gordon, why
the new almshouse wasn't built " and
equipped for $175,000.
: "I want Mr Gordon, as he repre

DISSENSION IN Gi
. I.-
SPREAD TO
' Dissension.- "which threatens : tcj
spread to every Republican - organiza
tion in the .'city has broken- out among
the Republicans of the Sixths-district.
A new (Republican club is'-being-form
ed there' and the.new club has walk
ed in ; and over the heads of the "old
club members, has takeh the ' rooms
they! formerly, occupied, at 1199 North
avenue. .- :r r "- . ; ...'-'-.. ' C-r"!-:.-
:- Lewi3 C; Willis is chairman of " the
committee- to- arrange for rooms and
he promptly procured the- quarters, of ;
the old club in the Feuer "Bros.';
building in North avenue. He paid $18
for a months' rent in advance. He
will take possession- March 1 and or
ganize the new club there. - Several
meetings of . those who are interested
have ' already -been held and . about
60 Republican voters have, signed the
membership roll.
A committee on organization, con
sisting .of .Deputy, Jailer Patrick
O'Brien, Edward Sherman and Louis
Blair has been named. ' The-' menv1
bership ' committee is Charles Kings
ton, former district chairman; Geo.
Fray,-' -Fred' "Morehouse and - Fred
Blakeman. y Michael Murphy, John
W. . Blakeman, ' Edward Ed dinger,
Daniel , O'Brien and Charlie Haefele
are members , of the .Good and Wel
fare committee of the organization.
The organization of the new club
dates from the last, primary , battle
when the O'Brien faction in the dis
trict was defeated and later Alfred
C. Knapp, bartender at James Car
roll's saloon,' 351 Main - street, was
elected "president.
r The members of the new club con
tend that the members of the old! club
are really . Democrats and that they
are Republicans for- revenue oniy."
The leading spirits in the old club are
Thomas " C. Cunningham, ,' deputy
sheriff, who was appointed district
chairman to harmonize things when
the split came over Charlie Kingston;
Mortimer Stowe, Benjamin Thorpe
and others. Mr. Thorpe-is register
ed on the ' Democratic primary list
fr""' .the Si Tti district.
The old club is about to move into
the stone building near the Oak m ov
ine picture theatre in Oak street. This
location, is on the extreme edge of the
'str'ft ;and the members claim it is
an puf of the way situation for a dis
trict political clnb location." Members
of the new club say that they have
given outings and other affairs by
which they have raised funds to keen
the treasury of the club intact and
that . most , of these registered in the
old cftib have never paid any dues.
. ' Mr. Willis, .who today paid the rent
for the club rooms with his own
money. - declared that before the end
of next month-he would have a cl'tb.
in the Sixth , district which would
number in lis membership at least ISO-
li'f itf ; ; 3 Gl 0 M E; I M FOG 5 .
give them more.
. "What I objected to and what the
board, of apportionment objects to is
the failure to build the almshouse for
$175,000, when that is the amount al
lowed by the people. We want Mr.
Gordon to explain this. He didn't
say anything about itn the statement.
"We want an explanation as to why,
not, only was the $175,000 exceeded,
but there is a deficit of $15,000," be
sides the money Courtade spent dig
ging the cellar:, for the almshouse,
an- shy, after -all this, there is an
almshouse with nothing in it
"There ' is , no objection . to ' the
amount eaten by the poor. .' That has
nothing to do with the failure to build
and furnish the almshouse for $175,
000. . ..'..
"One year ago, the board o appor
tionment; refused to .appropriate $22,
000 extra to equip the almshouse."
Dr. - Lynch said he had called thie
contractors of repute on the telephone
and each said the cellar of the alms
house ought to have.' been dug for
$2,000.

The Onondaga was five hours' steam
ing.7 away -when she .'picked up the
wireless, but 'the San Jacinto was be
lieved to be " much nearer though her
exact ' position . was not , given in, her
response to the Cretan.
- A dense " log . .was ' reported by the
Onondaga, to be .enveloping the coast
and this prevented top . speed ' being
made by the "rescue ships. The Cretan

BOTH INQUIRIES TO
-BE ENDED BY NIGHT
Coroner Mix Tries To Find
Why Sweeney Was on En
gine of No. 5 Train.
New Haven, Feb. 25 The federal
inquiry into the causes of the wreck
at Milford last Tuesday on the New
York, New Haven & Hartford rail
road, was completed today so 'far as
taking of testimony is concerned. The
commissions will now make, tests of
the signal devices - to determine their
efficiency and will have an inspection
made of the stretch of track at -Mil-ford
involved in the wreck.
The chief witness today was Gen
eral Manager C. L.. Bardo, of the
company, who declared in answer t,o
questions by H. W. Belknap that he
knew of no mechanical device which
could offset the human element
This element must be considered in
every case, he said. He could not
account for, the presence of Harold
Sweeney on the engine of the extra
passenger train with Engineer W. R.
Curtis and Fireman McGinn is, which
ran into the express and paid a tri
bute to the judgment tuxd 'qualifica
tions - of Curtle. f
The inquiry of Mr. Mix was devot
ed chiefly to clearing up the mystery
of the-. presence of Harry Sweeney,
who .had given up his position as a
student fireman three hours before
he was killed, on the engine of No. 5.
The coroner' says he is not inquiring
into the despatching of trains on the
road, leaving that tp the federal in
quiry, but is giving particular atten
tion to . the ; human element in the
accident. N
The first witness whom Mr. Bel
knap . questioned - was Michael Con
nelly, section man, working with Sec
tion Foreman Heath He had paid
no attention to signals. G. W. Wildin,
mechanical superintendent, testified
that- the jagged hole in the airhpss
was not caused by a blow out but by
a blow. The hose, he ..said, was of
standard quality. - r
Charles IT. Joy, general airbrake
inspector, said that -experiments made
byhimhad dempnrtrated that the
jagged .hole. iny the air hose might
have beeft made by the thrashing end
of the steam hose. It had already
been brought out that the steam hose
on the end of the leading coach ot
N 79; .Where the air hose is located,
had parted. , .,. . ' "
Both the .engines on the trains
were equipped with the most modern
8.irrake equipment. , Four . coaches
on No. 5 were of wood. All the
coaches on 79 were' of steeL The
Pullmans1, were of wood with steel
frames,,'
C. H." Morrison, signal engineer
explained in detail the automatic sig
nal, system and said that since its in
stallation there had been 258 signal
failures. r All but eight . had been
"safe" failures, that is the signal au
tomatically set at danger. , Question
ed as to the efficiency of the system,
Mr. Morrison said that since June,
1914, there had been over 7,000,000
movements over the ' stretch of 40
miles of track .and that the percent
age of efficiency, was 99.99 or about
one failure to , every 28,000 move

Sheriff Hugo Will Be Asked
For '; Deputies in Case
Some Strikers Return.
Ansonia; Feb. 25. With torrents of
rain falling, the city's streets were
deserted today and it was difficult to
ascertain the attitude of the 2,500
striking ; laborers of the American
Brass Co. toward the new wage in
crease of 15 per cent, announced yes
terday. It is known that a consid
erable, body of the strikers are anx
ious to return to work.
; Business . men and ' Mayor Schu
macher believe that a show of strength
will come next Monday morning when
the mills are re-opened and a part
of the strikers try to ' return. There is
one, element among the strikers which
has declared that no one will be per
mitted .to return ; unless the company
grants the full increase. This element
is of one nationality and is composed
of' about -15 per cent, of the whole
number of strikers.
Because of the uncompromising at
titude of the leaders of this element
Mayor Schumacher is preparing for
eventualities. Today it is understood
that he talked with High Sheriff Hugo
about , arrangements for having an ad
equate number of" deputies here eirly
Monday . or possibly Sunday night. The
company has' brought in more guards
and it is probable that the volunteer
firemen,, who, were sworn in as special
officers and have guarded the mills at
night, will not be seeded in that ca
pacity again. s
- TJ-e company now has enough
guards to hold all the entrances to the
several mills. Although there was
little evidence of strike conditions to
,av it was known that the authorities
.were quietly preparing for. trouble in
case it should come with the re-opening
of the mills.

CRONES TRIED TO
GET POSITION AT
REMINGTON PLANT
Seen In Drug Store In West
End, Another Report To -,
Local Police.
Investigation by the police today
failed "to ' reveal the whereabouts of
Jean Crones, the alleged soup poisoner
from Chicago, and It is the belief of
the authorities "that he has left the
city. The police authorities of Mid
dletown. Conn., have been notified of
his probable presence in this city last
night. , It is believed-that Crones may
go - to that city where a. brother . of
his resides. -
Crones was chef at the University
club in Chicago, Feb. 10, when a din
ner was given to a number of Catholic
priests and laymen, vin honor "of the
appointment of Bishop Mundelein to
the ? position of Archbishop of ; the
Archdiocese of Illinois. On the day
before the dinner, stock placed in the
soup was poisoned. Guests were made
ill by partaking of the poisoned soup.
A man answering the description of
Crones, applied for a . position at the
Remington Arms & Ammunition ' Co.
Wednesday, according to a report re-.
ceived at police headquarters at 8:30
this morning. He is, also reported as
having been seen in, the drug store
of Charles E. Keith at Fairfield and
Park avenues Wednesday evening
where he is said to have gone in
search of a room.
The man answering the description
of Crones procured a position as assis
tant chef at The Stratfleld yesterday
morning. He vhelped to prepare the
dinner served 300 members of the
Manufacturers' association and about
60 members, of the Wowompon
tribe, No. 4.0, Improved Order of Red
Men, at banquets given last night, v.
He was hired by Chef Joseph Kru
beau and worked until last evening
when he asked: the chef to procure
a dollar for him, part of his .day's
pay. . All the time the chef was won
dering where he had seen the strange
man before and suddenly the thought
dawned' upon him that the man was
Crones. Krubeau told Crones to wait a
minute until he got in- connection
with -the office. The chef called the
clerk and asked that House Detective
H. R. Hubbard be sent upstairs im
mediately.' " : .
, Crones heard the message delivered
over the phone and undetected he
hurriedly left the building. Upon, the
arrival of the house detective he was
gone. Hubbard got in communica
tion with police headquarters and De
tective George Simon hurried to the
Stratfield hotel. , The police scoured
the various hotels and restaurants in
this city during the night but were
unable to get any trace of Crones,
As a result bf the fact that Crones'
connection with the Stratfield , nbteij
has been made public House De
tective H. R. Hubbard was ( discharg
ed from his position today by order
of Manager Frank Cantwell. ' The
latter accuses Hubbard of giving the
story to a newspaper reporter. The
story came from police headquarters.
Concessions Made,

All the drop forgers and die tinkers

will be posted. No statement will be
made by the company, other than that
the terms of the return are "satisfac
tory." '
The early morning shift returned to

Washington, Feb. . 25 Pres
ident Wilson reiterated his op-1
position xo any action in Con
gress warning Americans off
armed ships In a conference"
early today with Speaker Clarke
Majority Leader Kitchin and
Chairman Flood, of the House
i Foreign Affairs Committee. .
They in, turn told the Presi
dent that if such a resolution
were brought to the vote in the 1
loiise at tnis time it would be
passed by a majority of two to
one. ' ' '
The President was unshaken
in his position that Congress
si ton d take no action embark
rassing his contention that the:
rights of Americans on ' th.6
seas must be respected at any!
cost. ' " '
The leaders went away tell-
ing the President nothing
would be done today , but they
ventured no predictions " for
the f uture. -They, admitted that !
the situation .was serious and
could not tell yet how far the
sentiment in Congress would
ne swayea ny me pumication -of
the President's views in his
letter to Senator Stone.
When the conference was over.
Speaker Clark said there 'was a rumor
that Germany would postpone the be-,
ginning of the new submarine cam
i i i t i
paign until April, or until the middle
of March. He would not say whether
he got his information from the Pres-
ident. - . . i
"The sum and substance of the con
ference," Speaker Clark said, "outside
of an explanation made as to the tem
per ot the House -regarding the diplo
matic situation, with Germany and
some argument on both sides id fully
set out in Senator Stone's letter to the :
President and the President's letter (
to Senator Stone.- I
"We explained to the President how
the Iuse felt,, in our . Judgment. , I
told the President that this warning
resolution would carry two to one if
they ever got a: chance for a vote.
Some enthusiastic gentlemen, .1 said,
thought, it would carry three to one.
, "Of course there was a great deal
of talk about international law- re
garding the rights of Americans on.
the seas and precedents. At the con
clusion of the conference, if was very
clear to all that President stands on
his letter to Senator Stone.
"But there are rumors which were
discussed that Germany may post
pone enforcement of the new admir-t
alty order to sink armed ships from
March 1, either to April 1 or the mid
dle . of March. . - i think the chances
are that Germany .will postpone this
threatened performance. This will
give more time for" consideration . of
this matter.'" - -
Regarding the possitf lity of action
in Congress in case Germany adheres
to her announcement that the admir
alty order will be" made" effective
March 1, Speaker Clark said it would
be very difficult to i get the warning
resolution out of a committee for ac
tion. v
Majority Leader Kitchin. and Rep
resentative Flood declined to discuss
what took place at the White House.
They said 'that' Speaker"Clark had
been selected . to issue alt statements.
It is known, however, -that both of
them advised the President that the;
sentiment in the House for -the reso
lution was strong.
. The President' told the House lead-,
ers he felt . the United States must'
stand for. the i-right of Americans t
the freedom of the: seas-and .that the
honor of .the; nation must be protect
ed at any . eventuality. . He. also told
the leaders the position -of the United .
States ; would be ; weakened if Con- ;
gress took action such as has beeil
proposed.
Speaker Clark,." Mr. Kitchin and
Mr.. Flood left' the White House say
ing they believed the situation seri-,
ous.
The -President, it was understood. '
was very emphatic in his demand that
the rights of Americans be upheld
and that Congress take no action.
As a result of the ' conference ad
ministration leaders in Congress are
expected to exert their strongest in
fluence to prevent . any action, at this
time. . . ' '"":- .
