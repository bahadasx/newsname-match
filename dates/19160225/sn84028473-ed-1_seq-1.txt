100 A YEAR
COUNTY SOHOOL COLUMN
As Indicated in the last Issue of tho
school column the two bond Issues at
lowcllvlllo and Boardman carried
nicely The vote in Lowellvllle was
9G to C4 in in its favor while tho
vote in Boardman stood 208 to 92
Lowellvllle plans with this Issue ot
25000 to add four class rooms and
an auditorium gymnasium to Its pres
ent north side building This will
enable the school authorities to rc
llee the congestion in the other grado
rooms and will probably give Lowell
vllle adequate school facilities for
several years to come
The new building at Boardman can
not necessarily be an Imposing one
since the bond issuo calls for but
30000 We believe however that
with this amount of money we can
erect a modern high school building
that will not only take care in first
class shape of the high school stu
dents but will also probably contain
two grammar grade rooms Of
course the building as was Indicated
in tho campaign for the bond Issue
will contain an adultorium adequate to
the needs of the community As was
indicated in tjie Qucstlonalre this
building will be located on the present
Boardman centralized site
March 1 Poland township will vote
on the bond Issue to the amount of
35000 for the purpose of erecting a
modern school building In the Lyons
plat district and a consolidated build
ing to take care of the children of tho
township who at present attend one
room schools Under the present ar
rangement but three one room schools
this year arc getting grade facilities
Children from these schools arc being
sent to the Poland Village school and
to bo sure they are delighted with
the new order ot things All Indlca
tlons point to a victory for the bond
issue
On the same date tho voters of tho
Sebrlng school district will vote on
the bond issue to the amount of 750u
for the purpose of adding two addi
tional grado rooms to the LMcKInley
bulldlng Sebrlng is a live and rap
Idly growing town and superintend
ent Alber is wise in insisting that
school facilities must make a growth
adequate to that of the town This
is as it ought to be The schools
ought always to lead and never to be
tho drag Nothing means more to
any school district in the way of
steady growth in population than ade
quate school facilities We believe
that the voters of Sebrlng will be only
too glad to authorize the expenditure
of this amount of money In order to
add two rooms to tho McKlnley school
building
The schools of Beaver No 1 dis
trict will take necessary steps for
either consolidation or union to tho
adjoining districts that have the equiv
alent of centralized schools
A public meeting has already been
held In each of the four school
