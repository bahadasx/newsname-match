Having done this by letter to Sen
ator Stone, the president took the
matter up again this morning in con
ference with Speaker wlark, Demo
cratic Leader Kitcnin and Chr« rman
Flood of the nouse foreign rei JUS
committee. Postponement of action
on tne resolution to warn American's
off armed merchantmen was the prob
able upshot of the conference. The
president gave no evidence of having
modified hia position as outlined in
his statement to Stone that this na
tion would "have in honor no choice
as to what our own eourse should
"be," if Germany should kill or ihjure
No action will be provoked to em
barrass the administration for the
present.
If it finally and conclusively de
velops that a break with Germany is
threatened—then and not until then
—will congress renew its efforts to
passing a warning resolution.
This was the program favored to
day by the leaders. However, instead
of lulling agitation of pacifists in con
gress favoring a warning resolution,
the president's action caused a fresh
determination to obtain such a reso
lution eventually.
What eiiect former Secretary of
State Bryan's statement from Miami,
Fia., favoring excluding Americans
from armed merchantmen would
have, was problematical. Most, of the
so-called "Bryan faction" in congress
a.readv have been committed to the
plan for adopting a warning resolu
tion.

[United Press Leased Wire Service.]
WASHINGTON, Feb. 25.—President
Wilson today asked congress not to
break the course of his negotiations
with Germany.
American citizens in her proposed
campaign against armed merchant
men. Tnis was uniformly interpreted
today as notice to congress, to the
American nation and also unequivo
cally to the central powers that he
is prepared to break off diplomatic
relations with the Teutonic allies if
their new boat warfare endangers
American lives.
.today's conference was expected
temporarily to allay the clamor fn
congress for modification of the pres
ident's policy. The action of the pres
ident in making public his letter to
Senator Stone and conferring with
the house leaders was thought to
bridge a difficult situation.
Profound effects were evident from
the president's letter to Stone. In
creased control by the administration
to head off action on warning resolu
tions was the pronounced surface de
velopment.
As a result of the white house con
ference this morning and the execu
tive's letter to Stone, administration
leaders believed the following pro
gram will ensue:
Congress will postpone action on
any warning resolutions until the out
come of the president's policy is defi
nitely ascertained.

With beginning of the new German
submarine campaign only four days
distant, there was no sign of Ger
many's reply to Secretary of State
Lansing's objections to the new ad
miralty order.
Many officials feared that Germany
will take a more stubborn stand. It
is not impossible, some believe, that
Germany may point out, in future
nqtes, the lack of united support for
the president's policy. Against this
development, the president's letter
virtually served notice today on Ger
many that he will not recede from his
decision to maintain to the letter of
international law the rights of Ameri
cans to travel on armed or unarmed
ships.
Following the president's '"•confer
ence with house leaders this morn
ing, an epochal meeting of the cabi
net was scheduled.
Senator Gore of Oklahoma planned
to ask one day postponement in the
senate of consideration of his warn
inc resolution. In the house the for
eign affairs committee was prepared
to temporarily sidetrack in commit
tee, the resolution of Stephens, Ne
braska, democrat, McLemore, Texas,
democrat Hillyard, Colorado, demo
crat, and Mondell, Wyoming, repub
lican, proposing to warn American
passengers.
President is Unyielding.
WSAHINGTON, Feb. 25.—Argument
by Speaker Clark, Democratic House
Leader Kltchin and Chairman Flood
of the house foreign affairs committee
today failed to move President Wilson
from his policy toward Germany.
After nearly an hour's conference
the president and the house leaders
were still in disagreement over reso
lutions warning Americans to stay
off armed merchantment. That no
action will be taken by congress, today
at least, was the upshot of the confer
ence.
The president emphatically told the
house leaders he would not budge
from his plan of insisting that Ger
many recognize every American right.
Speaker Clark as positively told the
president that sentiment in the house
is overwhelming in favor of a warn
ing resolution.
The president was told that the
house from the letters exchanged be
tween the president and Senator Stone
will determine what the sentiment is
for the present, the house leaders ad-1
vised the president no action would
be taken. It is not believed the house
will evolve a decision before next
week.
The three democratic leaders—all of
whom favor a warning resolution—
were closeted with the president from
9 o'clock until 9:50. Speaker Clark
was spokesman.

LONDON, Feb. 25.—The French are
now checking the great German drive
on Verdun and appear to be holding
their own except at a few minor
points, according to a special dis
patch from Paris today.
The crown prince's legions, sweep
ing southward, are now under heavy
fire from three of the Verdun forts.
At the same time they are exposed to
a murderous fire from the French
field redoubts and trenches in ad
vanced positions before the fortress.
The French artillery has maintain
ed such a heavy bombardment that
the Teutons have been unable to
bring up needed supply trains, accord
ing to Paris despatches.
Great battle fleets of French and
German aeroplanes are in constant
clash high above the woods and en
gaged in hurling down bombs upon
enemy artillery positions.
The check reported to have been
administered to the advancing Ger
mans may be only temporary- All
Paris despatches today agreed that
the Titanic struggle in the Meuse
woods marks the beginning of the
Germans greatest offensive blow
since the drive on Paris was defeated
at the Marne early in the war. One
despatch was quoted from what pur
ported to be an order of the day
issued by a German corps command
er, informing his troops that they
were bent on their "last offensive in
France."
"It is probable," wired the Paris
correspondent of the Chronicle, "that
the whole German force numbers
three quarters of a million or more.
Both sides being fully equipped and
prepared, the weight of artillery fire
now continuous since Monday morn
ing, Is almost without precedent.
The greatest confidence prevails in
Paris, according to latest advices
from the French capital. The French
have been aware of the German- prep
arations for t3e Verdun offensive for
many weeks, it was stated. French
air scouts have kept daily tab on the
building of new German supply rail

purpose of rushing up troops and
