WASHINGTON,' D. C Feb. "25:
Developments In Congress today show
. ed more plainly than ever, the split
,'v among Democrats upon 4he Issue of
the rl;ht of Americans te travel upon
:'. f armed - merchantmen of the belligerr
ents. M' . ' : , '' ''-' ,
The movement to i t Congress on
record as warning Anv ricans not to
travel on such ships was again renew
ed today, and as part cf It comes the
vigorous efforts made-by ex-Secretary
of State Bryan to ctTeat the preal-
1 dent's efforts to compel observance by
foreign powennof the right of Ameri
can travel. -
Senator Gore1 of Oklahoma, whose
resolution yesterday, to get Congreee
i on record as "warning Americana off
; these vessels was Objected to and post
poned, succeeded In . introducing the
resolution today under the "unanimous
consent" rule. It warna Americana
'-'.' not to travel on armed1 belligerent ves
sels. '
Senator Jones, Republican, of Wash
ington, Introduced absolution declar
ing it to be the sense of the senate
that the prealdent shoutd not send an
X ultimatum to a foreign power or sever
relations with a foreign power without
V consulting Congress and laying the sit
uation before it.
..-v One of the sensational features of
the day was ths receipt of telegrams
from Bryan by' numerous members,
among the members of the lower
house. These telegrams, . virtually
Identical in wording, were In support
of the movement to warn Americans
off armed belligerent ships.
The message was read from ' ths
" floor of. the house. The concluding
sentence says: : . ,:- ; . :;-
The mayor-of an American city
keeps the people of his city out of
the danger zone during a rioL. Our
government cannot afford to do less
when the world Is. in riot."

Straight to the sides of P. H. Dodge

marched and ; placed the wreaths
