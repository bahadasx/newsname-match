WILSON TO
UPHOLD ALL
OUR RIGHTS
Peace Only With
Honor Demands
President
CONGRESS IS QUIET
WASHINGTON, Feb. 24. -President
Wilson at the end of
two days of agitation in congress
for some action warning Amer
icans off armed merchant ships
of the European belligerents, to
night wrote Senator Stone, chair
man of the senate foreign rela
tions committee, that he could
not consent to any abridgment of
the rights of American citizens
in any respect.
The letter follows:
"February 24, 1916.. My Dear
Senator: I very warmly appre
ciate your kind and frank letter
of today and feel that it calls for
an equally frank reply.
"You are right in assuming
that I shall do everything in my
power to keep the United States
out of war. I think the country
will feel no uneasiness about my
course in that respect. Through
many anxious months I have
striven for that object, amidst
difficulties more manifold than
can have been apparent upon the
surface and so far I have suc
ceeded. I do not doubt that
shall continue to succeed. The
course which the central Euro
pean powers have announced
their intention of following in the
future with regard to undersea
warfare seems for the moment to
threaten insuperable obstacles,
but its apparent meaning is so
manifestly inconsistent with ex.
plicit assurances recently given
us by those powers with regard
to their treatment of merchant
vessels on the high seas that
must believe that explanations
will presently ensue which will
put a different aspect upon it.
We have had no reason to ques
tion their good faith or their fi
delity to their promises in the
past and I, for one, feel confi
dent that we shall have none in
the future. .
Uphold Our Rights.
"But in any event our duty is
clear. No nation or group of na
tions has the right while the war
is in progress to alter or disre
gard the principles which all na
tions have agreed upon in mitiga
tion of the horrors and sufferings
of war, and if the clear rights of
American citizens should ever un
happily be abridged or denied by
any such action, we should, it
seems to me, have in honor no
choice as to what our own course
should be.
"For my own pint I cannot runwnl
In any abridgement of the right of
American citizens in any respect. The
honor anil self-respect of thp nation
is Involved. We covet peace ami' shall
picseivo It at any cost but the loss of
iionor. To furbiii our people to exer
cise their rights for fear we might

GOING AFTER THE
LAND SWINDLERS
County Attorney Kvers De
termined to Prosecute
Vigorously.
TRIALS ARE TODAY
Defendants Are Accused of
Trading Worthless Ken
tucky L'roperty.
Counly Attorney J. P. Kvers said
yesterday that the slate will use a
written statement in .fudge Daniel's
court this morning from needier
Staplctnn, county clerk of Johnson
county, Kentucky, as t he trump card
in the prosecution of several Tulsa
real estate dealers on charges of sell
ing and exchanging worthless deeds
for land In the Alexander W'alcott
grunt.
Staiilelon arrived here veslerdav
and an effort was made to bring the
cases to trial at once, but owing to
continuances that had previously
bon u greed upon this could not bo
arranged.
The cases attracted wide attention
a few weeks ago when several Infor
mations were sworn out charging
Harry White, It. G. Horns anil It. Ii.
Prown with selling worthless lands.
The men were arrested but released
on bond.
There arc four cases now pending.
II. G. Burns and Many White are
charged with giving a worthless deed
for Hit) acres of Kentucky lands III
exchange for the Central hotel at
Ulton. The information was signed
by Mrs. Ida 1 Hitler.
In Several Deals
Others who were induced to ex
change valuable property for the
worthless deeds are J. L. Slmc of this
city, who traded a farm In I'nion
county, New Mexico; Samuel Hotter
of Tulsa, who traded one hundred and
sixty acres of good laud in Chavls
county, New Mexico, und C. M. Mur
ray, who was induced to exchange u
new automobile for a deed to some of
the land, and W. K. Rogers, who trad
ed a half Interest in the Prim-ess con
fectionery store in the postofflce block
for u deed for 320 acres.
The r-ul estate men admit they
made the deals but claim they did not
know the titles were not clear. The
W'alcott grant comprises some six
hundred and fifty thousand acres, but
the Kentucky court of appeals by a
decision handed down us early as
lN.'il dci hired that Walcift was not
entitled to the land.
Ktaplcton said yesterday (bat peo
ple in all parts of the l ulled states
have been "slung" on this laud by
the same methods that were used
