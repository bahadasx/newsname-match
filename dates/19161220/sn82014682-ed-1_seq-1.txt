'WASHINGTON, D. C., Dec 2). -
The way was cleared yesterday for
legislative action today In the senate
on the Mil providing prohibition In
the District of Columbia. The amend
ment proposed by Senator Underwood
providing that the subject of prohibi
tion be referred to a vote of the po
plc was lost on a tie vote.
By C. Z. ALBERT
(Spcx-iiil BUr Buliotin Currpt-i-oudrnre)
WASHINGTON, D. CVDec. 10. The
fight for prohibition In Hawaii .and
the District of 'Columbia started off
"like a house afire. , The major move-
; ment got under. way before Congress
was a week old. In fact- It seemed
difficult to restrain the advance guard
until the opening day and the presi
dent's address Were out of the way.
The fifth day of the session saw the
s.senata buUMy engaged in discussing all
. forms of wetness and dryness.
; t is self-e1dent there will be no
. let-up . In the fight - nntil Warch -4.
There' must either be legislation or' a
good reason for postponing it. Notice
already has been served on the house
that if a fair and square record vote is
refused by the leaders aver there pro
hibition will be offered as an amend
ment to the -District of Columbia ap
propriation bilL .
It is . accepted as certain that pro
hibition will prevail, so far as this city
and Hawaii are concerned, if a decis
ive vote is reached. For that reason
the opponents will devote all of their
nergles to preventing '; such a vote.
Various plans already are under con-
. eideration. The referendum is the one
most highly favored. It is urged that
the citizenship of the affected terri
??ry be allowed to express their pref -
fences In the matter. This at least
Would mean delay. Senator Under
wood Is strongly urging that this be
done.
Senator Sheppard, as heretofore, is
heading the fight for prohibition. He
Is determined to win if possible at this
session. In such an event he will
bring up next year the struggle for
nation-wide legislation
to
eliminate
ium. He believes the capital city and
Hawaii can be made dry before the j Smith'a success as a grower before
4th of March rolls around. AH those j makes it unnecessary to bring the ex

Following the talk by Gen. Strong.
President Wallace R. Farrington, on
behalf of the-Ad Club, presented the
march song. "Schofield." to the U. -S.
Army. This march was written by
Captain Henry Berger, and proved to
be a successful hit when rendered on
the piano by the w'ell known band
leader. Gen. Strong thanked the Ad
Club and Henry Berger for the
march, promising that it would be
used by the military organizations of
the islands. ' .- ,. .; --
Jack Warren in a short talk told of

will ever do for Honolulu. "Tourist

guished author-educator, who arrived
in the WMhelmina with Mrs. 7lyle to
visit ttu'ir sen. James I). Ioie. here.
As a pacifist of renown the doctor
was deeply disappointed that Knglanu
and her allies have, so completely dis
regarded Germany's step as the press
despatches of yesterday indicated.
"The least the Allies might have
don?." hp savB. "would have been to
agk Germany what she had to nroi03e.
Inrtead, they apparently d:d not try to
make inquiries into the nature of
peace arrangements.
Mr. Dole says further that the
slightest indication of ieace, from no
matter what source or for what rea
son, should command tne earnest a i-
tention of all belligerents in such an
awful, impossible struggle. -
Nearer the Middle
?
cf the fighting factions are now will
ing to admit," was his opinion of final
arrangements;
The doctor took a polite knock at
the United States before leaving tlie
peace discussion by saying it was too
bad this country did not lead all otner
neutrals in a demand for peace and
the encouragement of any proposals.
i believe the whole world will now
think from our pass Iveness after Cer
many's proposals," he aays, "that the
United States is not at all anxious for
the war to atop. We should correct
that impression."
Directly in line with the peace ques
tion the author flayed militarism, pre
paredness and compulsory training for
war. He says. there Is nothing that
incites the fear and suspicion of ether
countries more than a demonstration
of that same fear and suspicion in thi3
country. .
If all men were like Dr. Dole there
would be absolutely no military
preparation, but he admits that under
existing conditions a certain amount
iS necessary, although the push and
trend should be against instead of
for it. He. declares conscription is
the height of undemocraejv ..
Hughes Had Nothing to Say
There was a merry twinkle in Dr.
Dole's eye -when he stated that Mr.
Hughes might have done a little pei
ter in the. presidential campaign if he
had stayed home and not gone about
trwing to do the impossible, winning
votes without cne real issue. -
"The national election pointed oui
one thing which has not been dis
cussed," he says, "that ought to be
apparent to anyone, that Is, the end
of partisan platforms and more of the
man in the race.-
"CerUinly the people of the United
States did not want war; that's one
reason why they returned Mr: Wilson
to the presidency. But then the ma
jority of people in any country do not
want war; there is where the despic
ableness of the whole war plan comes
in. The few control and ruin the mul
titudes." . -. ' -.:
Dr. Dole is intensely Interested : in
the assimilation of the Oriental peo
ple in Hawaii and may write some
thing about conditions among them,
although he came here with ho inten
tion of doing so. He says much of his
writing has followed a suggestion or
a reqyest rather than deliberate in
tention on his part.
