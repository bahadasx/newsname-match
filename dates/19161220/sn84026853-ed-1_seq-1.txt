The Baptists have fitted / up the
basement of their church for reading
rooms and a gymnasium for the
benefit of the people of the fcity.
In the reading rooms they are
* commencing the establishment of a
library. They will also have the
latest magazines so that a person
who wishes , to drop in for an hour
or so may entertain himself with
reading either a good book or one
of the latest magazines. In these
rooms also such games as checkers
and dominos may be played, as well
other quiet games which will not
disturb those who wish to read.
Stationery is also provided so that
a person may drop in and write a
letter home, or to a friend, or to
any one else.
In the main auditorium the games
of volley ball and basket ball are being
played. Other devices for exercising.

installed, and others will be installed
from time to time, until all of the
ispace is used for the purpose for
which it is designed.

auditorium, as well as the reading
rooms, will be at the disposal of the

Madrid, Dec. 18.:?(Via Paris.)?
The twenty-four hour general strike
called by the labor organizations as
a protest against the increased, price

SOME MILITIA ARE
TAKEN FROM BORDER
Washington, Dec. 18.?The war
department announced today that the
withdrawal of 16,647 militiamen
from the Mexican border, leaving
76.000 militiamen there and indicat
ing that it is the purpose of the administration
to continue a large
force on the border and to keep
Pershing in Mexico for some time to
come.
Officials of the war department
state that if Pershing's forces was
withrawft from Mexico his army with
the other units of the regular establishment
would be sufficient to protect
the border against bandit raids
and therefore the continuance of
such a large force of guardsmen in
the service means that Pegshing wiH

past several months until the Mexican
situation improves.
THE FURNITURE EMPORIUM.
President Kerr is Belling and loading
so much furniture^ these days
that he hasn't time to keep his mind
on his set-back college. The fact is
that he allowed CoL Pat Roche . to
inveiiflehinr out of hia charter last
Tuesday night when the Colonel went
up {(gainst the President and one of
his professors. The President, had
not played amateur set-back in a
good while, and while he was thinking
of the big biHs he had been selling
that day and for several days,
before, Col. Roche put one over oh
him.
But if you undertake to do the
same- trick in selling furniture you
will have a more difficult task than
Col. Roche had, because the Presient
is qp on the furniture business.
He knows all about beds because he
sleeps in one every night, and he
likes a dining table so well that he
has this line of. his business "by
heart."
Looking for the big trade he knew
he' would have before the- holidays,
he bought all kinds of things and
has them in his store. If you are
looking for something for yOur wife,
which she needs, and which you
should give her, you will find" it at
Kerrs Furniture Store. Give him a
call, but doh't get him started to
talking on set-back, if you have any
other business to transact.
