VS TO OUR MOUNTAIN LANDS.
Verdicts Continued in Nineteen Con?
denotation l*noeeedlng Unsee,
(Oreenville News, 17(li.)
A number of Interesting law suits,
In which the history of Revolutionary
war days will probably be dragged
from its ?rave, will lu all probability
rome up in tho Federal Court herons
a result of the condemnation by the
Hutted States of land in Oconeo coun
ty for the purpose of o ron tin g a na
tional forest reserve.
.Indre .los. T. Johnson yesterday
afternoon tiled orders continuing tho
condemnation verdicts in nineteen
cases. Involving a total of about $21.
000, which ls to be paid to the own
ers of these tracts of land, whenever
the ownership is definitely determin
ed by legal processes.
.Indee Johnnsn'.s orders confirming
the condemnation verdict in these
nineteen eases were Immediately
sent in to the proper olllcials at.
Washington, and the money will lie
sent here to ,1, ll. Knight, dorl? of
tho Federal Court, probably within
the next ten days. A deed to tho
properties will then ho given to tho
United States, and the government
will then miter upon tho possession
of these lands as part of tho groat
Appalachian forest reserve I hat ls to
be established lu this territory.
These nineteen tracts of land lu Oco
neo county are tho llrst lands to IH>
received in South Carolina by tho
government in the establishment of
this forest reserve, but there aro a
number of others on their way
through the courts.
Nulls for Money.
When the government will pay for
the land, and take possession, tho
question of who will get tho monoy
for tho property is an entirely dif
ferent matter, and will have to IMJ
settled by a number of law suits.
While tho persons now in posses
sion of the lands are named in tho
condemnation proceedings, they may
or may not get the money which 1?
to be held by the Clerk of the Court
here until the title to it ls decided.
The titles to these properties seem
very much undetermined, and claims
for the money for the same will bo
made by heirs of Robert MOITIB, de
ceased, of Philadelphia, hy members
of the Calhoun family, and by helm
of .lohn Nicholson, and probably oth
ers. Their claim to the property
goes back to grants of enormous
tracts ol' land in that vicinity, mnde
about 171HI. Transactions later than
this have been lu some eases hy word
or mouth, and no record seems to
exist.
Revolutionary Financier.
Wobert Morris, as is well known, is
the man who is reputed to have li
na need (ho Revolutionary war.
(?rants of many thousand acres of
land iu Oconeo count y aro on record,
and these will probably ho brought,
in as the basis of Mic claims of Iiis
heirs to the money to be received.
Similar largo grants were mado to
.lames Fd ward Calhoun, and among
tho claimants for his alleged share
in the money will probably be the
Calhoun Kails Company.
The present holders of tho lands,
of course, will put np a stiff light for
tho money.
The deeds for these various prop
erties were worked up by A A. Man
ning.

were confirmed by Judge Johnson
