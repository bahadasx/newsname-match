Overseas News Agency Re-
. views Rumanian Situa
tion and West Front.
Berlin, Germany, Dec 10. (Wireless
to Sayville.) The military critic of the
Overseas News agency, in an article
on the situation on the various fronts,
tars :
"In spite of the rainy weather and
the completely soaked roads in eastern
Wallachia. the Teutonic allies are mak
lrg rapid progress. The fragments of
the Rumanian army are being Irresisti
bly driven into a square which is hard
ly SO kilometers wide and bounded
by the Danube on the east, by the
mountains on the west and the Sereth
river on the north. Through this flat
district flows the Buzeu river. The
chance of resistance is small as the
river haa been crossed on a broad
front by the pursuing troops. The only
Iarge town in this district still in Ru
manian hands is Rimnik Sarat. The
towns of Braila, Galatz and Fokshanl.
from a strategic and geographic point
of view, belong to the Sereth position."
"In Dobrudja the Russians have been
driven by the Bulgarians until they are
couth of Babadagh.
"The front of the central powers
now has been shortened 900 kilome
ters, (about 600 miles which is as
cuch as considered possible.
Attack a Political Demonstration.
"In the western theater the situation
is unchanged except for local engage
ments. The French advance near Ver
dun was nothing but a political demon
stration and will be unable to exercise
any Influence on the general situation.
The balance of the year of 1916, there
fore, will not be improved for the
trench by small local successes. After
months of sanguinary fighting and
heavy French and English losses-the
front in France and Belgium is virtual
ly the same as It was in December,
1915."
BRITAIN'S FOOD CONTROL
MEASURE CALLED FAILURE
London. Eng.. Dec. 20. According to
some of the newspapers, two days' ex
perience of the first food control
measure, which regulates the number
and nature of courses served in hotels
and restaurants, has been sufficient to
prove it futile. They say It has not
only failed to check consumption, hut
In many instances it has increased it.
It is claimed that there is no super
vision and that many customers, find
ing that they can indulge in several
servings of the same dish, have availed
themselves freely of this loophole.
Moreover, there is nothing to prevent
anyone from taking a succession of
meals in different places.
The papers urge food tickets or a
tax on hotels and retaurant bills, aa

alization of British shipping, men
tioned briefly by premier Lloyd-George
as one of the first acts of the new
ministry, command more Interest here
from the strictly American point of
view than any other phase of the
premier's speech. What effect It would
lave on American foreign trade and
on the state of British ships sunk
fcy German submarines has opened a
new and unexpected series of question
which officials regard with much con
cern. The taking Into national service of
the whole mercantile marine, follow
ing closely on England's announcement
that ehe could not guarantee coal at
any of her coaling bases the world
over except to ships conserving allied
interests, is thought by officials at
first glance to turn over the great
majority of the world's carrying trade
to specific war purposes. There is in
law nothing the United States can do
should the whole British merchant
marine be withdrawn from American
trade and harbors.
Will Remove Cunfualon.
It is thought the effect of the sub
marine situation would be to remove
confusion between public vessels not
entitled to any guarantees and private
vessels entitled to warning and pro
vision for the safety of those on board.
Just where the point of distinction
would lie, is a complex question.

Dealers Ask Investigation
of Causes; Railways Say
Supplies Coming.
Chicago, I1L, Dec 20. Following a
series of conferences, Chicago coal
dealers, facing a possible coal famine,
today announced that an appeal for
an Inquiry Into the local situation ahd
been made to the federal trade com
mission. The dealers made this statement:
The cause must be dealt with ac
cording to Its dimensions. The coal
shortage Is national. An Investigation
that Is less broad than the cause must
fall In its purpose."
Railroad men and coal dealers as
serted today, however, that they saw
some relief for the shortage, which
seriously handicapped the heating of
some of the larger buildings in the
city, in the fact that coal had begun
to move Into Chicago again from the
West Virginia fields.

Students In Kentucky
College Eat Seven Cent
Meals and Put On Flesh
Berea, Ky.. Dec. 20. In order to
prove that the high cost of living
has not reached every part of the
contry, Berea college, in the Kentucky
mountains, is responsible for the state
ment that its 1400 students are fed at
a cost of 7 cents per meal, that thev
gained "several tons" in weight and
that the boarding hall made a net gain
of S359.49.
In explaining tihs record, president
Frost of the college refers first to the
economy of numbers, some 1490 stu
dents bein? In constant attendance In
the five departments. Another ex
planation of the 7 cent meal is the fact
that most of the students are accus
tomed to plain fare, so that tbey almost
unanimously choose to go without lea,
coffee and butter to reduce expenses.
To offset these omissions the "balance
ration" has been introduced on the
assumption that it Is Just as important
for students as '"for any other live
stock."

Industrial Conscription Will
Fail If Men Are Hostile,
Is the Belief.
CHAMBERLAIN'S
TASKIS HUGE
Director General Will Have
Charge Of Military and
Civil Recruiting.
LON-DON. Eng, Dec. 20. Genera
mobilization of laboring men for
war and the vital industries
loomed up today as the most Impor
tant of the vast domestic program out
lined by premier David Lloyd George
in his address In the house of com
mons Tuesday.
Mr. Lloyd George Indicated he meant
to begin with a voluntary plan and
that it this failed, he would ask par
liament to give the government com
pulsory; powers to place' all the labor
of the state at its services. His pro-posalt-tberefore
follows somewhat on
-the'-llne -of the German mass levy.
Labor Leaders Are DonbtfaL
When Mr. Lloyd George Invited the
labor representatives to join his cab
inet this scheme was put before them,
but they deferred judgment until de
tails were given to them. While ex
pressing the opinion that Industrial
conscription Is not Impracticable, the
labor leaders are dubious as to Its
success, feeling the outcome depends
entirely on how the workmen take It.
If there is hostility In the rank and
file of organized labor, the scheme,
they believe, will fail.
Director' Tasl Prodigious.
The task allotted to Nevillo Cham
berlain, who has been appointed di
rector general of national service, of
scheduling certain industries as indis
pensable and supplying them with the
necessary labor and material and at
the same time putting the dispens
able inSnstries on fixed allowances of
labor, raw material and man power, is
considered a stupendous one. but Mr.
Chamberlain's great experience In
business Is expected to carry him
through. He will have a military di
rector under him to conduct recruiting
for the army and a civil director in
charge of recruiting for industry.
t, ..BlK ,n'inUe Controled.
Dealing with the relations of the
tIc12m?,wlSatne seneral govern
ment, Mr. Lloyd George in his speech
suggested that the connection be main
tained by circulation of reports of the
proceedings of the cabinet.
Shipping and coal mines are to b
put under the same kind of control as
railways.
To Solve Irish Problem.
The fact that the premier passea
straight from Ireland to the imperial
conference suggests that he hopes to
find a solution of the Irish problem
in this conference. It has been prom
ised previously that Ireland would be
one of the subjects of discussion ai
the next imperial conference and as
most of the dominions' favor some form
of home rule, it is believed this would
be the best means of settling the long
disputed question.
To Deal With Food Problem.
The government probably will re
quire the whole eight weeks of the
parliamentary recess to produce the
measures foreshadowed, which also in
clude more drastic dealing with ex
cess profits and an increase in food
production by an extension of cultiva
tion. Tribute to the Army.
The latter part of the premier's
speech, dealing with the British army
was viewed as a remarkable tribute.
The premier, after referring to the fact
that a new army is now facing
Britain's enemies, said:
"The old had done its duty and spent
itself in the achievement of that great
