HEALTH HINTS—TAKE NOTICE.
If parents would keep their children
at home and not permit them to have
parties or house-to-house visits among
them it would aid the health authori
ties much in eliminating the contag
ious disease present in the city and
county. If-your child does not feel
or look well, take him or her to your
physician or have him call so' that
the disease will not spread if ijt hap
pens t9 be contagious.
The mildest form of any contagious
disease is more liable to be spread be
cause the afflicted one is not confined
to bed, but is going to school or fol
lowing the regular roptine work and
coming in contact with Numerous per
sons, and thUB scattering the disease.
The Mild cases of'contagion are Just
as liable to infect or give It to others
as when it is severe.
Symptoms of Scarlet Fever.
The beginning symptoms of scarlet
fecer are: Headache, sick at stomach,
fever, tired feeling, throat is red and
may be sore, a few days Jater a scarlet
redness of the skin appears, usually
on the neck and face.
Each child afflicted does not have all
these symptoms. Some may have all,
others have only twd or three of them.

MANCHESTER IS GOING FORWARD.
Either under a City Manager or ilnder the City Council.
Which Shall it Be?
At the meeting of the Commercial Club on Monday even
ing, after some discussion, a committee of five was ap
pointed to {ret more, facts in regard to the new plan of city
government known as the City Manager plan. This com
mittee is chosen from those in favor of a change and those
pposed and a full discussion of the matter will be had at
next meeting, to which the public is invited.,
This meeting will be held at the \Court House at 7:15
P. M. on January 2nd. The regular Commercial Club din
ner will be held at Sramek's restaurant at 6:30 and adjourn
ment will then be had to the Court House, and every per
son interested in better government for Manchester is urged
to be present..
At the conclusion of the discussion a vote will be taken
as to whether the Commercial Club shall get behind the City
Manager plan or work with the City Council and Mayor to
secure a more efficient administration.
The advocates of the City Manager plan point to the
fact that all big business enterprises are run by a general
manager under a Board of Directors and claim that the
City's business is as complicated and important as any bus
iness carried on in the city and should be managed by a
competant man at ah adequate aalary who shall give his
whole time to the mamgeneftt et the city's affairs just the
same as if it were ainy other business enterprise. He would
be under the control of a council of three Corresponding to
the present city council.
The opponents of the plan ffiftke much of the added
expense which they claim will result to the city, but the
other side responds that all cities where the plan is in op
eration claim that the city manager saves the city more than
jthe amount of his salary.
It is conceded by both sides that neither the city man
ager plan nor the city council and mayor plan is a success
unless the men who carry out the plan are the right men.
The advocates of the city manager plan claim that with good
men to work out the plan the city manager system gives the
most efficient administration. Are they right?
Come to the Court House, January 2nd at 7:15 P. M.
and here their views and express your own. The committee
appointed by the Commercial Club to investigate the matter
and IftMlfe discussion are: C. G. Yoran, E. M. Carr, A. R.

CHRISTMAS EVE, 1916.
By Rev. W. J. Suckow.
Long years ago the music rang
Through silent-Held and lonely glen,
When hosts of shining angels sang
Ot "peace on earth, good-will to men:"
When star-led from afar
Appeared to hall the new-born King,
Whose reign should lift the curse of war
And world-wide peace and blessing bring.
Tonight,, where peaceful hamlets slood
By verdant meads and vinyards fair,
The reeking earth is drenched with blood,
The roar of battle rends the air.
War dims the stars with baleful glow
Of hurtling shot and screaming shell
War changes all the earth below
Into a red and flaming hell.
From fields where dead and wonded lie,
From captives praying for release.
From starving millions, comes the cry:
"Where is the Christ, the Prince of Peace?"
Where through the trenches dark and d*ep
The tide of battle ebbs and flows,
Where orphans moan and widows weep,
Unseen the Man of Sorrows goes.
Where souls are overwhelmed with grief,.
And hearts are breaking in despair,
With none at hand to give relief, -v1'
The Christ of Bethlehem is there.
And still with patience rare and sweet
He waits the dawning of the day.
When erring hearts and wayward feet
Shall seek and find the better way
When lordly rations .humbly learn.
Through bitterness of tears and blood,
That peace, for which today they yearn
Is found alone in Brotherhood.
Tonight, above.earth's shadows dim,
Still shines the great prophetic Word:
Some day all knees shall bow to Him,
And every tongue confess Him lord
Some day the cannon's roar shall cease.
The blood-stained battle flags be furled.
And Christ the Lord, the Prince of Peace,
As king of kings shall rule the world.

WilTCH' tqitB ^fltK SUPPLY.
£The Iowa StitwBAard of Health in
a letter to the school board of the
independent school district of Man
chester, last week garve the
community should be carefully watch
ed and expressed a warning that much
ciisease is comhidniedted through this
Agency, ttofthpjrfe tt^AoW^Vital to the

ck 'k.
community than1 thaet 'itp
public milk supply should be pure.
Municipalities and pi^bjic health offi
cers Ae county over have of late years
been devoting much attention to the
subject and mnf most cities have ordi
nances providing for milk inspection,
-in other words'no milk can be offer
ed for public sale the source of which
cannot be inspected and approved or
disapproved by. an officer representing
the city. In practice it works out very
satisfactorily.
/The
cows furnishing
the public milk supply are inspected as
to their health and surroundings.
Manchester should adopt a system of
milk inspection £nd milk from cows
which have not been inspected should
not be allowed to be sold in the city.
It would be a very simple and inex
pensive matter to put into early oper
ation here. Action along this line by
the city council would meet with
hearty approval.
Veterinarian C. M. Morgan of this
city has given the tuberculin test to
several hundred animals in this vicin
ity the past year and says that there
Is an alarming prevalance of tuber
culosis among cattle. He is strongly
of the opinion that only milk from
cows 'which have been tested for tu
berculosis and found to be healthy
should be allowed, to be sold in the
city. The city council should it seems
exercise the authority it has in these
matters and as other cities have done
and are doing take the necessary
steps to insure a pure public milk
supply for Manchester.
MILKING MACHINE FOR MODERN
DAIRY.
Hutchinson ft Briggs proprietors of
the Golden Meadow Dairy are about to
equip their herds with milking ma
chines, of the latest approved type. It
is the aim of this dairy to supply the
public with nothing btit the best of
milk and to this end their entire herd
was given the tuberculin test. They
have fifty young animalB mostly Hol
stein all of which have been examined
and certified to be healthy. The use of
milking machines is recognized as a
cleaner method than hand milking and
they are generally used in dairies sup
plying milk for the larger cities. Clean,
pure milk is essential to public health
and the Golden Meadow Dairy is to be
commended for the efforts it lawmaking
for pure milk.
LIGHT WINDOW CANDLES ON
