Three Put In Limboo Saturday Night by
Officers of the Law.
i Saturday night Marshal Hill Lowery
onri Rhoritt mu Toilert arrested Lin
eal E. Dorton, Ex-Sheriff Vance Hincb
and Town Watson for disorderly con-
duct
When they took Ernest Dorton to
the jail to put him in a cell he object-
d to being put in the cell with Victor
Rush, who was convicted of murdering
hia brother and sister-in law, Deputy
Khr. Handle struck Mr. Dor-
ton in the bead twice or three times
witb a pair of brass knucks and cut his
'head so badly that Dr. V. L. Lewis
had to take three stitches in one wound
and two in another. Dorton did not
offer any violent resistance but told
the officers he was no criminal and uul
not want to be put in the cell with
Rush, tie remained thereuntil Sun
day morning when he was brought be
fore Recorder 0. U. Rector anil sub
mitted to the charge of being drunk
and was lined ten dollars. He was also
taken before Esq. U. S. Rose, who
placed a tine of $2.50 on him.
Mr. Dorton was arrested by Sheriff
lollett and Deputy Brendle while ly
ing down in the coal house to the rear
of the Rector restaurant. He had nut
been disorderly or boisterous but had
been drinking and when he began to
get sick w.nt to the coal house to get
out of sight and recover from the
effects of the whiskey he had drunk
No young man in the community is
more universally liked than Ernest
Dorton, but he is afflicted with the
jpjakness of IM being able to refrain
from drinking occasionally. When in
that condition he is never noisy or
quarrelsome but wants to laugn or
joke.
It was the proper thing to do to ar
rest him for being drunk but why
officers would suffer a prisoner to be
abused in such a manner is past under
standing. Mr. Dorton has taken out warrants
forBrendle; one lor assault and the
other for carrying brass knucks.
Watson was.pretty well tanked up
when he was arrested, but refused to
be put in the cell with the murderer,
Victor Rush, and the officers confined
bim in a cell on the ground floor of
the jail, where be remained until
morning.
From our information it seems that
the arrest of Ex -Sheriff Vance Hinch
resulted irom a quarrel that arose be
tween him and Sheriff Tollett. The
charge of drunkenness was lodged
against him.

BRYAN AGAINST
OWNERSHIP BY
THE GOVERNMENT
Gives Newlands Committee His
Views on Railroad Control.
COMPETITION PREFERABLE.
j
federal Regulation Should Not Be A!
lowed to Sxolude Exercise of Stats
Authority, He Contends Thinks Rail
road Stocks Should Represent Actual
Valuo end Be Stable as Government
Bondt.
Washington, Dec. 11. William J.
Bryan, who startled the country ten
years ago by advocating government
ownership of railroads, appeared be
fore the Newlands Joint Committee on
Interstate Commerce last week In sup-
Krt of the claim that the states should
allowed to retain authority over the
regulation of all transportation lines
within their borders. Mr. Bryan ex
plained that he had long regarded gov-
trnment ownership as Inevitable, but
because of railroad opposition to
Against Government Ownership.
"Personally I cannot say that I de-
lire government ownership," he ex
plained, "because I lean to the lndl
vidua 1 idea rather than U the collec
tive idea; that Is, I believe that gov
ernment ownership is desirable only
where competition is impossible."
Alfred P. Thorn, counsel to the Rail
way Executives' Advisory Committee,
previously had presented before the
members of the Newlands Committee
as one of his reasons for urging a bet
ter balanced and more systematic reg-
ulatlon of railroads the argument that
this is the only alternative to govern
ment ownership. Calling attention to
the restrictions imposed upon the
transportation lines by conflicting state
laws and regulations, to the practical
cessation of new construction and to the
Impossibility under existing conditions
of securing the new capital needed for
extensions and betterments of railway
facilities, he warned the Congressmen
that unless they provided a fair and
reasonable system of regulation that
would enable the railroads to meet the
growing needs of the country's busi
ness the national government would
be compelled to take over the owner
ship of the lines with all the evils at
tendant upon such a system.
Preservation of Competition.
Mr. Bryan, on the other hand, holds
that tlie further extension of federal
authority over the railroads would he
a Btep In the direction of government
ownership. He advanced the view that
the centralization of control In the
hands of the national government
would impose too great a burden upon
the regulating body, would offer strong
temptation to railroads to Interfere In
politics and would encourage tlie gen
eral movement toward centralization
of power In the federal government al
the expense of the states. He said thai
he did not object to consolidations of
railroad lines so long as they did not
destroy competition, that he knew of
no complaint against gival railway
systems because of their size and that
be believed that the preservation of
competition was the test to he applied
to all consolidations.
Regulation of Securities.
Mr. Bryan declared himself In favoi
of national regulation of railway Stock
and bond Issues, but added that he saw
no reason why that should exclude the
states from acting on the same sub
ject as to state corporations. "I would
like to see the stock of a railroad, as
long as it Is in private hands, made as
substantial and as unvarying as the
value of a government bond," he as
serted.
He suggested that railroad capltali
zation be readjusted to equalize it w1t'
actual valuation or the property rep
resented, making due allowance fo
equities, and that when this whs don
the roads should be allowed to ea'n
sufficient income to keep their st
nt par and to create a surplus. 1
latter, he tentatively proposed, mil
be allowed to amount to 2." per
of the capital.
OLD TREE STILL PRODUCTIVE
Planted by Governor Endicott Nearly
Three Centuries Ago, It Bears
Yearly Crop of Fine Fruit.
Thought to be the oldest fruit tree
In this country, the pear tree planted
j 280 years ago by Governor Endicott of
; Massachusetts is still thriving well and
bearing a yearly crop of fruit of the
first quality. John Endicott purchased
a large tract of land at Danversport,
then known as the southern section of
I Salem village. The estate afterward
became known as the Endicott plan
tation. Governor Endicott, being a
great lover of sugar pears, sent to a
relative in Dorchester, England, for a
pear tree. After several months the
tree arrived, and at that time few peo
ple ever believed that the tree would
live, as the roots had become v"tT.v dry.
The governor, believing that ho, bet
ter than anyone else, was the proper
man to plant the tree, journeyed to the
plantation and there, in a sheltered
spot close to the Danvers river, dug
u hole and carefully planted it. For
many years ho cared for it himself,
and It was not long before it became
the most famous of all fruit trees of
Massachusetts. This year it is esti
mated that there were close to 8,000
pears on the tree. Few people who
visited Danvers missed the opportunity
of seeing this wonderful tree, which
was carefully guarded by a picket
fence. The tree is made up of three
distinct trunks, which are partially de
cayed, although the upper section of
the tree is quite healthy in appearance.
Endicott himself used to relate that
the tree supplied a sufficient number 1
of pears to supply the entire Salem
Village, which in those days numbered :
less than one hundred Inhabitants.
when Governoi- Endicott tiled in the
year 1665 special mention was made
In his will In regard to the famous tree,
which was left In care of his daughter.
GOES FAR BACK IN HISTORY
Nippur Tablet, Recently Discovered
and Translated, Has Brought Joy
to Archeologists.
A Sumerian epic that tells the story
of the reconstruction of civilization af
ter the deluge has been discovered on
one of the famous Nippur tablets In
the University of Pennsylvania mu
seum. Announcement of the discov
ery and the completion of the trans-
lation of the epic has just been made Cooper will continue to reside in May
by Dr. Stephen H. Langdon, Sumeri- iand.
an scholar and assistant curator of
the museum. The epic, according to
Doctor Langdon, takes up the history
of civilization after Paradise, the fall
of man and the flood, and is a sequel
to the Sumerian epic which he trans
lated n year ago. The fragment which
contains the latest history is four and
one-half Inches long and one inch
thick. It contains about 300 lines of
inscriptions. It dates from about
2250 B. C, and hence represents a lit
erature older than that of the Baby
lonians and the Chaldeans. "The boat
or ark is mentioned." Doctor Lnng
don announces, "as well as Lahama,
the god of the deluge. It describes the
regeneration of the ancient land of
Sumerla at the hands of the god of
wisdom, who decreed that it should
be the center of civilization.'
Not At All Likely.
"Do you think the widow of the
man who was lynched will win her
damage suit against the mob?"
"I reckon not," replied Mr. Gap
Johnson of Rumpus Ridge. "When a
lady loses the kind of a husband that
a mob would nacherly lynch, she hasn't
lost anything. And when a gang of
prominent citizens take time from their
own business to lynch a cuss Just b'cus

Thief Feared Siege of Paris.
A woman shoplifter who was caught
In the act of appropriating a curtain
from a Paris emporium wus sentenced
to ten months' imprisonment. An
enormous quantity of stolen objects,
consisting chiefly of provisions and ar
ticles of clothing, was found at her
apartment. Her excuse before the
judge was that the articles had been
laid In by her as a precaution against
a siege of Paris, an argument which
failed to move the court.
CinjLECTION
Light Vote Because of Bad Weather and
Lack of Interest
The city election Friday brought out
a very light vote. So little interest
was taken in it, because of only one
ticket being in the field, that only one
of the men appointed to hold the elec
tion was present, and others were
substituted as they could be conven
iently picked up.
John Q. Burnett was the officer of
election because M. W. West, who had
been named by the city authorities,
! was a candidate and was thereby ren-
dered incompetent. H. R. Webb was
; disqualified in the same way. Ed An
derson, Peter Weaver and J. S. Garri
son were the judges and B. H. West
and U. S. Rose were clerks. Only 59
votes went in the box and one ot them
was voted blank. The vote stood as
follows :
A. L. Garrison, for mayor. Go.
For aldermen, M. W. West, 67, M.
F Keed 57, Fred Cate 56, Mike Hale
56.
H. R. Webb, for member of school
board 54.
Had the day been fair there would
have been several more votes cast.
Only seven democratic votes were
cast. It is thought that many Demo
crats refrained from voting because all
members of the ticket were Republi
cans.
