SERMON ON THE SA­

There are those of other denomina­

asked to let them know our view
and what we hold in regard to this
Sacrament.
Now that the text for next Sun­
day touches upon this subject, we'll
thru the knowledge derived from the
Scriptures and the grace of the
Triune God, present a few reasons
for administering this sacrament, ac­
cording to our faith.

Boy and Girl Members of Agricult­
ural Clubs Master Physical Diffi­
culties and Business Problems.
How the initiative of boys and
girls in all sections of the country
is being developed through the ju­
venile agricultural club work foster­
ed by the department in cooperation
with the State agricultural colleges,
and how interest in the work is
spreading among adults as well as
children, is brought out by reports
received by the States Relations Ser­
vice of the department.
Three school boys in the state of
Washington who were given the use
of an acre of land for five years in
return for clearing not only made a
profit from a potato crop the first
year, but with the logs from the
clearing built a substantial club­
house on the school grounds and fur­
nished it. School luncheons are now
served in this building by girl club
members.
Four girls in another portion of
the same state, having only rocky
land available on which to grow their
gardens, removed four wagonloads of
stones and now have thriving plats.
From both West Virginia and Ida­
ho came reports of the development
of business ability in young boys. In
West Virginia a small boy began
operations with one hen. With the
proceeds from the sale of chickens
raised he bought a pig. After fatten­
ing the pig he solid it and bought a
calf, which he raised to a cow. With
the proceeds from the sale of the
cow the boy has taken up the regu­
lar business of cattle raising on a
small scale. In Idaho a young club
member, through raising a few pigs
and calves, obtained enough capital
to engage in the regular business of
buying and selling hides.
Girl club members in the State of
Washington have shown their busi­
ness ability by taking orders from
near-by lumber camps to furnish
canned goods from their home-can­
ning club supply.
The-civic value of the^club /york
has recently been recognized by tlie
mayor of Glenwood Springs, Colo.,
who gave free water for irrigating
garden plats on vacant city lots. In
Wyoming a woman serving without
compensation as local leader in club
work rode 210 miles on horseback to
receive additional instruction in the
methods of club leadership for girls.
In the Southern States, where this
work has been in progress for several
years, hundreds of girls have made
their own money to buy canning out­
fits, with which they can not only
can their own products but they also
can for their neighbors on shares.
Fully as many boys have saved
enough from their crops to buy pigs,
calves, colts, lambs, and chickens and
are now prospering in the live stock
business. Many students are taking
agriculture and home economics in
the colleges because of their own ac­
tivity and thrift as members of these
clubs.
-Merry Xmas-
A CHRISTMAS CAROL.
In the stillness of the midnight,
In the silence of the Star,
In the slumber of the white lambs,
On the hillsides, near and far,
Came the Christ Child to his mo­
ther
To the humble oxen's stall
He, the babe of Paradise, sweet
Lord of Christmas, King of all
Hush, let not a word be spoken
Of his sacrifice for men,
Stooping from this world of glory,
To the woman-born a pen
Of sweet straw to be his- cradle,
He is ours, just ours, today,
Mark that mortal smile, that shin­
ing
Of the halo in the sky!
While the palm trees rustle softly,
While his lullaby, the breeze,
Croons amid the angels' anthem,
Which the star-lit heaven cleaves
We will claim him ours, our trea­
sure,
Christmas Babe, and Babe divine
Hail, thrice, hail, O mystic stran­
ger,
Nestling in the straw-filled
shrine!
—Helen Chase, in Brooklyn Eagle.

INDS WILL BE
OPEN FOR SETTLEMENT
1t,0§0 Acres of State Swamp Lands
in St. Louis, Lake and Cook
Counties.
All remaining state swamp lands
in St. Louis, Lake and Cook counties,
comprising substantially 10,000 acres
will be open for settlement by the
state during 1917.
This action is made possible thru
the action of the Duluth & Iron
Range railroad, which company Mon­
day filed its last selection list for 5,
448.9 acres, completing its grant of
606,720 acres awarded by the state
when it constructed its line romDu
luth to Ely. The filing of this list
with the patent that will follow
from the state in due time is of
tremendous importance to St. Louis,
Lake and Cook counties. About a
year ago the company released about
100,000 acres so that it might be ap­
praised and sold to settlers and its
astion today released another 100,000
acres.
On March 12, 1860, congress gran­
ted to the State of Minnesota, all
swamp lands within its borders. Up
to date there has been patented to
the state 4,711,278.18 acres.
Of this acreage 2,892,141.30 acres
were given to railroad companies, in
consideration of the construction of
railroads, title to which of course
went to the railroad companies.
Tames J. Hill demonstrated that no
land grant was necessary. Without
•t he became the greatest railroad
builder of the continent.
Lands, timber and iron ore in fabu
'ous sums were given away in Minne­
sota.
Under the act which granted these
lands to the Duluth & Iron Range
Railroad Company the company had
the right to select certain of its
lands anywhere within these coun­
ties at any time it pleased, until the
surveys of the government should
have been made of every township
within these counties.
The result of the filing of the final
list will therefore be that all swamp
latods in' St.-vLouis,* Lake afid Cook
counties can now be sold by the
state and placed upon the tax rolls
of these counties..
This is the last selection made of
any swamp lands granted by the
state of Minnesota to thirteen dif­
ferent railroad companies, aggregat­
ing 2,892,141.30 acres.

Improved Roads .Effect Gross Sav­
ing of $627,409 in Eight Select
%d 'Counties
Improvement of roads in eight se­
lected counties in different sections
of the United States resulted, in the
aggregate, in a total gross annual
saving in hauling costs of $627,409,
according to recent economic studies
made by the Office of Public Roads.
and Rural Engineering by the de­
partment. The cost of haulage for
the group of counties is lower since
the roads were improved, it was
found, even when charges are made
in the comparative computation for
interest on bonds and annual main­
tenance costs. The results of the
studies, which extended from 1905 to
1915, and which included other ef­
fects of improved highways than
those on traffic, are shown in De­
partment Bulletin 393, recently pub­
lished.
The eight counties in which the
studies were made are Spotsylvania,
Dinwiddie, Lee, and Wise Counties,
Va. Franklin County, N. Y. Dallas
County, Ala. Lauderdale County,
Miss. and Manatee County, Fla.
These counties were selected because
they had just issued bonds for road
improvement when it was decided to
make the studies, and it would there­
fore be possible to cover the road
improvements from outset to com­
pletion.
The average gross annual saving in
hauling costs due to the road im­
provements in these eight counties
was found to be 17.9 cents per ton
mile, while the net saving was found
to be 11.6 The investigators point
out in the bulletin that an actual
cash saving to the amount indicated
is not effected, but that this is the
indicated saving when the time of
workers and use of draft animals
and equipment are given cash values
at the rates prevailing in the several
communities.
Effects by Counties
In Spotsylvania County, Va., a
bond issue^of 8173,000 was provided
and 76 miles of road wer^ improved.
The average loads hauled in a two
horse wagon increased materially af­
ter the roads were improved, and
ton-mile costs dropped from 30 cents
to 13.7 cents. This meant a gross
ton-mile saving of 16.3 cents, or a
net ton-mile saving, when charges
were made for interest on bonds and
maintenance of roads, of 14.9 cents.
The gross total annual saving in the
county is, therefore, approximately
$150,000: and when deductions are
made for interest and maintenance
costs, the annual indicated net sav­
ing is $130,670.
In Dinwiddie County, Va., a bond
issue of $105,000 was provided, and
the State contributed, in addition,
nearly $40,000 worth of convict la­
bor. The improved road mileage at
the completion of the study was 101
miles. Average loads for a two-horse
wagon increased from 2,000 to about
3,200 pounds, and ton-mile costs de­
creased from 30 cents to 15 cents.
The net ton-mile saving is 13.7 cents,
and the indicated gross saving for
the county is $124,970.
