ENGLISH TRADE
POLICY VIEWED
WITH CONCERN
Nationalization of Shipping
May Remove Merchant
Marine from U. S. Trade
OPENS UP SERIES
OF BIG QUESTIONS
Unable to Say What Effect
it Will Have on Ameri
can Trade.
Washington, Dec., 20.—Nationalism
of Bi'itish shipping, mentioned brief
ly by Premier Lloyd George as one
of the first acts of the new war min
istry, commands more interest from
the strictly American point of view
than any other phase of the premier's
speech. What effect it would have on
American foreign trade and on the
status of British ships sunk by Ger
man submarines has opened a new
and unexpected series of questions
which officials regard with much con
cern.
The taking into the national ser
vice of the whole mercantile marine
following closely on England's an
nouncement that she could not guar
antee coal at any of her coaling bases
the world over, except to ships con
serving allied Interests, is thought by
officials at first glance to turn over
the great majority of the world's car
rying trade to specific war purposes.
The effect on commerce for Ameri
can purposes and not of service to the
allies is problematical, especially as
to the completeness with which Lloyd
George enforces the order. Neverthe
less there is in law nothing the Unit
ed States can do should the whole
British merchant marine be with
drawn from American trade and har
bors.

Bismarck, N. D., Bee. 20.—The sal
aries of all elective state officers were
held up today by the state auditor,
who declined to issue warrants for the
retiring Justices of the supreme court
until the question as to the length of
term is settled. Inasmuch as the rule
has been to Issue all official warrants
at the same time none of the elective
state officers and employes received
pay today as usual. Action on official
pay roll was deferred until Saturday,
when State Auditor Jorgenson will
return from a junket with the budget
board.
Styling the provisional tribunal a
"Kangaroo court," and declaring that
its members had no more authority
or jurisdiction than "any other four
men who might have been picked up
on the street," William Lemke, coun
sel for the Justices-elect, has served
notice on both the state treasurer and
the auditor warning them against
paying salaries tjKhe retiring Justices
for December.

government suit on charges that the
companies used the malls to defraud.
He repeated his statement made yes
terday that the wild horses exist in

the defendants never received re
turns from the sales of "wild horses,"
Mr. Smith testified that he had made
several trades for land In which he

GfTTING TACTS
IN SHAPE FOR
IfGISlATURE
State Officers Prepare Their
Annual Reports For
Law Makers.
SECRETARY HALL IS
NOT IN A HURRY
Insurance Commissioner
Urges Revision of Code—
Finances the Great Issue
Bismarck, X. D., Dec. 20.—The fact
that departments may propose but the
legislature disposes has not prevented
the various department chiefs at the
capital from making the usual recom
mendations for legislations which they
deem advisable.
Perhaps the principal exception is
Secretary of State Thomas Hall. Two
years ago his biennial report em
bodied many suggestions for legis
lation. Copies of the report were
sent in advance of the session to every
member of the general assembly. As
result, every member had his mind
a result, every memoer naa nis muiu
made up to rap or not to rap meas-
ures favored by the secretary of state,
and so many decided in favor of rap
ping, that hardly a bill proposed by
Mr. Hall passed the two houses. This
year the secretary of state may have
some very well-defined Ideas as to
necessary legislation, but he Isn't tell
ing about them.
More Stringent Auto Tax.
A bill has been drawn embodying
some of the secretary of state's views
on the automobile license registration
fee. it would assess machines ac
cording to the horsepower, fees rang
ing from $3 to $25 and up. Machin
ery is also proposed for making the
registration more complete, as the
secretary of state estimates that at
least 88 per cent of the cars now
owned and operated in North Dakota
escape registration under the present
system. Either the duplicate tag
system will be eliminated, or a re
quirement will be made that both tags
be displayed. At present a generous
auto-owner who buys two tags, as re
quired by law, is compelled by that
same law to display but one, and
there Is nothing in the-law to prevent
him from loaning his extra tag to
some good friend, providing both sue-
least 16.000 do, it is said
Mrtas Insurance Code.
Retlnng Commissioner, of insurance
Taylor suggests thit the kibosh be
appyed -to .fiatth Dakota's present
state hatllitttarance law, and that the
state. If it relaly is In favor of state
insurance,- discover some method
which will work. He would also like
to see a readjustment of state fire in
surance rates and a rating system es
tablished under the direction of the
commissioner somewhat similar to
that employed in Minnesota, He fur
thermore advises a complete revision
of the entire insurance code of North
Dakota, which he finds antequated
and entirely Inadequate to meet pres
ent conditions.
Legislation for Education.
Only two Btates in the union spend
more per capita for education than
North Dakota. Anything which retir
ing Superintendent of Public Instruc
tion E. J. Taylor may recommend in
this connection is, therefore^ of im
portance. Under the head of recom
mendations for legislation, Mr. Taylor
lists In order:
An amendment to Sections 82 and
150 of the state constitution which
would make it possible to select the
county and state superintendents for
terms of four or more years.
Liberal state aid to consolidated
schools located In rural districts.
A minimum term of eight months
in any public school in the state.
Authorization of the appointment
by school boards of truant officers
who may legally compel attendance at
school throughout term of all pupils
of school age.
Amendment to constitution to allow
apportionment of state funds to be
made on basis of school attendance
rather than on number of pupils of
school age in district, irrespective of
attendance.

Chicago, Dec. 20.—Following a se

dealers, facing a possible coal famine,

Dec. 19, Via London, Dec. 20.—Out of
a group of German prisoners taken
on one section of the British front
one Sunday, only a non-commissioned
officer had heard anything of the Ger
man emperor's peace proposal. This
circumstance, coupled with the fact
that there have been no demonstra
tions from any part of the German
trenches, caused much speculation
among the British officers as to
whether, despite the emperor's ad
dress to his troops, the new peace
overtures have been permitted to

Documents captured within the last
few days repeatedly mentioned the
audacity and initiative of the allied
air men and Field Marshal von Hin
denburg is quoted as having issued
orders that the supremacy of the air
must be sharply contested.
German artillery recently has been
active and lias responded more free
ly to the continuous British fire. Ac
cording to prisoners the preponder
ance of British shells has depressed
the German troops in the trenches
who thought their own artillery was
not supporting them with the same
vigor as the support the English gave
to their men.

Great Britain the following message:
"On taking up the high office with
which his majesty has charged me. I
send to you on behalf of the people
of the old country a message to our
brothers beyond the seas. There is no
faltering in our determination that
the sacrifices which we and you have
made and have still to make shall not
be in vain and that the fight which
we are waging together for humanity
and civilization shall be fought to a
triumphant issue. We realize that we
shall need every man that we can put
In the field, every effort which a unit
ed people can put forth to help In
this heavy task of our soldiers and
sailors.
"The splendid contributions to the
common cause already made by the
Dominion give me sure confidence
that their determination is no less
high than ours and that however long
the path to final victory we shall
tread it side by side."
Sir Robert replied as follows:
"We can reply that. God willing,
we shall, do our duty in this struggle
to the end. No sacrifice on our part
shall be spared to make triumphant
the cause for which the allied nations
are contending."

Commenting on Premier Lloyd

chau of Berlin says:
"Reparation could be demanded by
England only if Germany had de
clared war on England, If we were to
blame for the war. If we had permit
ted crimes against international law
and if we had been defeated."
The Lokal Anseiger takes the view
point that Mr. Lloyd George's re
marks about reparation are of no
value inasmuch as nothing has been
said thus far about peace conditions.
This newspaper continues:
"If Lloyd George means to post
pone satisfying Europe's desire for
peace until the time when the en
tente Is successful In conquering Ger
many's armies and those of her allies,
then the whole of Europe, as well as
Lloyd George, knows full well that

HARD TIME OF YEAR
TO CARE FOR NEEDY
Russia Only Partially Has
Solved Problems Made by
Poles and Jews.
Petrograd, Deo. 20.—The passage
across the Russian frontier of thou
sands of Rumanians who have aban
doned their houses and property in
the face of the invading Germans and
Bulgarians has cast a shadow of a
new refugee problem on the Russian
empire- These refugees have been
pouring Into Odessa, Kiev and other
southern Russian cities in a destitute
and helpless condition, and present a
problem which threatens to be more
difficult than any which has confront
ed a belligerent power since the in
vasion of Belgium. Russia has only
partially succeeded In colonising and
assimilating the millions of homeless
Poles, Jews and members of other
races who fled to the interior during
the first year and a half of the war.
This Is naturally the worst time of
the year in which to care for refugees
and the economlo re-establishment,
which the present political' crisis has
emphasised, adds to the difficulty of
clothing and supporting a new nation..
The magnitude of Russia's econ
omlo burden is appreciable when It 1s
considered that the country has re
ceived already since the beginning of
the war a refugee population far ex
ceeding the combined citlcenshlp of
the Scandinavian countries, while the
resources of the country have been
