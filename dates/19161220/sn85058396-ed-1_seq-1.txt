Critic Calls French Advance at

Berlin, Dec. 19, by wireless Say
ville. The military critic of the
Overseas News Agency, in an article
on the situation on the various fronts,
says :
"In spite of the rainy weather and
the completely soaked roads in east
ern Wallachia, the Teutonic allies are
I making rapid progress. The fragments
of the Rumanian army are being irre
sistibly driven into a square which
is hardly eighty kilometers wide and
bounded by tho Danube on the east,
by the mountains on tho west and
the Soreth river on the north. Through
this flat district flows the Busou
river. Tho chances of resistance is
small as the river has been crossed
on a broad front by the pursuing
troops. The only large town in this
district still in Rumanian bands is
Rimnik Sarat Tbe towns of Braila.
Galatz and Fokshani, from a strategic
and geographic point of view, belong
to the Sereth position.
"In Dobrudja the Russians have

as is considered possible.
"In the western theater the situa
tion Is unchanged except for local
engagements. The French advance
near Verdun was nothing but a politi
cal demonstration and will be unable
to exercise any influence on the gen
eral situation. The balance of the
year of 191G, therefore, will not be
improved for the French by small
local successes. After months of san
guinary fighting and heavy French
and English losses, the front in France
and Belgium is virtually the same as
it was in December, 19-15."

LLOYD-GEDRGE'S
REPLY APPROVED
British Press Unitedly Upholds
Premier's Statement on
Germany's Proposal.
WAY TO PEACE LEFT
Universal League to Enforce
Peace, With America Join
ing, Is Urged.
London, Dec. 20, 11:20 a. m. Pre
mier Lloyd-George's reply to Ger
many's peace proposal meets with a
chorus of approval by the British
press and the general comment is
that, if Germany really wants peace,
she will, when the joint reply of the
allies is received, state terms which
can form .a basis of discussion.
The Manchester Guardian says:
"Premier Lloyd-George has not shut
the door on peace with that resound
ing clang for which sorne of his less
balanced supporters in the press have
been listening. It is true he insisted
on the impossibility of accepting the
German invitation as It stands. In
this he was ably seconded by Mr. As
quith and will be approved by ihe
country. The German chan
cellor must be both more modest and
more explicit before he can expect
any favorable answer to his invita
tion. But the real danger in the sit
uation which his offer created, was
mat. me ames, tins cuuuu? iu ii uv
ular, might be led into an abrupt and
sweeping refusal, not merely of the
actual invitation bui of any proposal
to discuss peaco terms. This snare
Lloyd-George has avoided."
i The Guardian says that as the
speech invited Germany to bo more
explicit, "we do not then cast out ev
ery idea of settlement and the neu
tral world cannot take exception to
this attitude."
No Hint of Crushing Germany. .
; The Guardian notes that the speech
contained no hint of the crushing of
Germany but says discussion of any
matter is conditioned on restitution.
In the truest form, it continues, repa
ration is impossible, for the deepest
wrongs cannot be undone.
"Security we certainly require," the
Guardian, continues. "The best se
curity is the firm, unbroken front of
the alliance, fortified when the war
ends by a universal league to enforce
peace. In such a league America
would play a great part and her pres
ence alone would be no small secur
ity." Great Volume of Opinion.
Expressing the opinion that Chan
cellor von Bethmann-Hollweg will ad
mit on reflection that the proposals
of the entente allies, as outlined by
Mr. Lloyd-George, formed a basis for
discussion, the Guardian says:
"There is in this, as in all countries
at war, a great volume of opinion, too
little vocal, unfortunately, in favor of
a serious effort on the part of Eu-
lUpUS SlrtlCSlliUIl LU J.JUL nil UilU V.U UiC
carnage which is destroying tho
whole generation of the young.
May Adopt French System.
Dealing with the relations of the
war cabinet with the general govern
ment, Mr. Lloyd-George suggested
that the connection be maintained by
circulation of reports of the proceed
ings of the cabinet. As to parliament,
he hinted that the present French
system might be adopted.
Shipping and coal mines are to be
put under the same kind of control
as railways.
Home Rule for Ireland.
The fact that the premier passed
straight from Ireland to the imperial
"conference suggests that he hopes to
find a solution of the Irish problem in
this conference. It had been promised
nrovSmifilv that. Trrl:inrt wnnlri hn nne
of the subjects of discussion at tho
next imperial conference and as most
of tho dominions favor some sort of
home rule, it is believed this will be
tho best means of sottling the long
disputed question.
The government probably will re
quire the whole eight weeks of the
parliamentary recess to produce the
measures foreshadowed which also
j Include more drastic dealing with ex
cess profits and an increase in food
production by an oxtension of cultiva
tion. Vast Domestic Program.
The British public had much to re
flect on this morning. Tho reply of
Premier Lloyd-Georgo to the Gorman
.peace proposals had been anticipated
and passages of his speech dealing
with that question appeared in the
late editions of yesterday evenjng's
newspapers. Tho domestic program of
the new government, however, was
not published until this morning and
it was too vast and too briefly indicat
ed for he immediate crystallization
of opinion.
The most important of theso points
; foreshadowed by the premier was the
; general mobilization of labor for war
; and the vital industries.. Mr. Lloyd-
George indicated he meant to bogin
I with a voluntary plan and that if this
! failed he would ask parliament to give
t 1 the government compulsory powers to
place all the labor power of the state
at its service. His proposal, therefore,
follows somewhat on the line of the
German mass levy.
Labor Party Withholds Opinion.
When Mr. Lloyd-George invited the
labor representatives to join his cab
inet, this scheme was put before them,
but they deferred judgment until de
tails were given to them. While ox
pressing the opinion that, after indus
trial military service, conscription is
not practicable, tho labor leaders are
dubious as to its success, feeling the
outcome depends entirely on how the
workmen take it. If there is hostility
in the rank and file of organized labor
the scheme, they believe, will fail.
Stupendous Task Allotted.
The task allotted to Neville Cham
berlain, who has been appointed director-general
of national service, of
scheduling certain industries as indis
pensable and supplying them with the"
necessary labor and material and at
11.. mi Hn thp inrlisnensa.
U1U btiims vimvj -'--" o 4
ble industries on fixed allowances of
labor, raw material and man power, is
considered a stupendous one, but Mr.
Chamberlain's great experience in bus
iness is expected to carry him
through. He will have a military di
rector under him to conduct recruit
ing for the army and a civil director
in charge of recruiting or Industry.
Overseas Dominions Busy.
London, Dec. 20. 1:40 p. m. At a
meeting of the Empire Parliamentary
association today. Walter Hume
Long, secretary of state for the col
onies, said the time for holding the
imperial conference mentioned by
Premier Lloyd-George in his speech
yesterday' depended upon the Over
seas dominions. Their premiers, he
added, were engaged in work as
strenuous, anxious and as important
as that of those in the home government.

Did Not Declare War on Eng
land, Has Not Violated Inter
national Law, Is Un
defeated. WIDE GULF BETWEEN
Lloyd-George's Speech Means
Eternal Hostilities Unless
Germany Can Force End.
Amsterdam, Dec. 20, via London,
11:50 a. m. Commenting on, Premier
Lloyd-George's speech, the Taegliche
Rundschau of Berlin says:
"Reparation could bo demanded by
England only if Germany had declared
war on England, if we wore to blame
for the war, if we had committed
crimes against International law and
if we had been defeated."
The Lokal Anzieger takes the view-
point mat iur. jjiuyu-Meuifco o j. v.
about reparation are of no value in
as much as nothing has been said thus
far about peaco conditions.
The newspaper continues:
"If Lloyd-George means to postpone
satisfying Europe's desire for peace
until the time when the entente is
successful in conquering Germany's
armies and those of her allies, then the
whole of Europe as well as Lloyd
George, knows full well that this an
nouncement means eternal war, unless
it is in the power of tho German com
mand to bring it to an earlier termina
tion than Lloyd-George supposes."
The Tageblatt says it prefers to
await the promised reply of the en
tente, adding:
"For the present it appears that the
gulf is very great between Lloyd
George's standpoint and that describ
ed from the German side as tho basis
for peace." A

SHIPPING PLAN
CAUSES CONCERN
Nationalization of British
Ships Commands Deep In
terest in Foreign
Trade Circles.
U. S. IS HELPLESS
Whole Merchant Marine May
Be Withdrawn From
American Trade and
Harbors.
r
Washington, Dec. 20. Nationaliza
tion of British shipping, mentioned
briefly by Premier Lloyd-George as
one of tho first acts of tho new war
ministry, commands more interest
here from the strictly American point
of view than any other phase of the
premier's speech. What effect it
I would have on American foreign
trade and the status of British ships
sunk by German submarines has
opened a new and unexpected series
of questions which officials regard
with much concern.
The taking into the national serv
ice of the whole mercantile marine,
following closely on England's an
nouncement that she could not guar
antee coal at any of her coaling bases
the world over except to ships con
serving allied interests, is thought by
officials at first glance to turn over
the great majority of tho world s car
rying trade to specific war purposes.
The effect on commerce for American
purposes and not of service to tho al
lies is problematical, especially as to
the completeness with which Lloyd
George enforces the order. Neverthe
less, there is in law nothing the Unit
ed States can do, should the whole
British merchant marine be with
drawn from American trade and har
bors. Facing Complex Question.
It Is thought the effect on the sub
marine situation would be to remove
confusion between public vessels not
entitled to any guarantees and pri
vate vessels entitled to warning and
provision for the safety of those on
board. Just where the point of dis
tinction would lie is a complex ques
tion. Lloyd-George's announcement of
the recognition of the agents of
Venizelos raises the question of what
should be the attitude of this gov
ernment If Venizelos should become
the de facto ruler of an appreciable
part of Greece. A similar question
has been faced, since England took
over from Turkey the sovereignty of
Egypt, but no decision reached, The
state department has not been able
to credit a new consul-general to
Cairo because it did not know wheth
er to credit him to Great Britain or to
Turkey. Generally, the department
has not recognized changes made dur
ing the war, preferring to wait for the
I peace settlement.
FOOD CONTROL
FAILS IN LONDON
Papers Urge Food Tickets, or
Tax on Hotels as in
Paris.
London, Dec. 20. According to some
of the newspapers, two days' exper
ience of the first food control meas
ure, which regulates the number and
nature of courses served in hotels and
restaurants, has been sufficient to
prove it futile. They say that no only
has it failed to check consumption, but
In many instances it has increased it.
It is claimed that there is no super
vision and that many customers, find
ing that thoy can indulge in several
servings of the same dish wiiout
having more than one course counted
against them, have availed themselves
freely of this loophole. Moreover,"
there is nothing to prevent anyone
from taking a succession of meals in
different places. The papers urge food
tickets, or a tax on hotels and res
taurant bills as in Paris.

GERMANS HAD IT

Prisoners Taken by British

to End Hostilities.
DOCUMENTS CAPTURED
Von Hindenburg Issues Or
ders That Allied Supremacy
of Air Must Be Met.
With the British Armies in France,
Dec. 19, via London, Dec. 20, 5:30 a. m.
Out of a group of German prisoners
taken on one section of the British
front on Sunday only a non-commissioned
officer had heard anything of
the German emperor's peace proposal.
This circumstance, coupled with the
fact that there have been no dem
onstrations from any part of the Ger
man trenches, caused much specula
tion among the British officers as to
whether, during tho emperor's address
to his troops, the new peace overtures
have been permitted to reach the men
actually Engaged on the fighting line.
Documents captured within the last
few days repeatedly mention the au
dacity and initiative of the allied air
men "and Field Marshal von Hinden
burg is quoted as having issued or
ders that the supremacy of the air
must be sharply contested. According
to these documents, the German chief
of staff has ordered that where the
German lines are crossed by hostile
aviators, German machines must pen
etrate an equal distance over the al
lied lines. There has been only a
comparatively few hours of good flying
weather in the last week, but nu
merous combats have taken place,
twenty being fought on one morning
on a certain sector.
German artillery has recently been
active and has responded more freely
to the continuousBritish fire. Accord
ing to prisoners, the preponderance of
British shells has depressed the Ger
man troops in the trenches who
thought that their own artillery was
not supporting them with the samo
vigo? as the support the English gave
to their men.
COAL SHORTAGE

Appeal Made to Federal Com

Investigation.

Chicago, Dec. 20. Following a ser
ies of conferences, Chicago coal deal
ers, facing a possible coal famine, to
dav announced thafan appeal foran
inquiry into tho local situation had
been made to the federal trade com
mission. After stating their view that the
shortage in fuel began in New Eng
land a year ago and since has extend
ed to the Rocky mountains, the deal
ers made this statement:
"The cause must be dealt with ac
cording to its dimensions. Tho coal
shortage is national. An investiga
tion that is less broad than the cause
must fail in its purpose. Local in
vestigations by cities and states will
do no good."
Railroad men and coal dealers as
serted today, however, that they saw
some relief for the shortage, which
seriously handicapped the heating of
some of the larger buildings in the
to move into Chicago again from the
city, in the fact that coal bad begun

Petrograd, Dec. 19, 2:00 p. m., via I
London, Dec. 20, 3:55 a. m. The pas- I
sage across the Russian frontier of I j
thousands of Rumanians who have R
abandoned their houses and property IN
in the face of the invading Germans j
and Bulgarians has cast the shadow 1 j
of a new refuge problem on the Rus- 1 1
sian empire. These refugees have 1 1
been pouring into Odessa, Kiev and i 1
other southern Russian cities in a des- I
titute and helpless condition and pre- I
sent a problem which threatens to be I
more difficult than any which has con- 1
fronted a belligerent power since tho I
invasion of Belgium. 1
Russia has only partially succeeded I
in colonizing and assimilating tho mil- 1
lions of homeless Poles, Jews and II
members of other races who fled to ' 1 I
the interior during tho first year and I
a half, of the war. This is natural- I 1
ly the worst time of the year in which t I I
to care for refugees and the economic IjjH
readjustment which the present pol- 1 I
itical crisis has emphasized, adds to '11
the difficulty of clothing and suppcrt- I
ing a new nation. I I
Enormous Economic Burden. I I I
The magnitude of Russia's economic I
burden is appreciable when it is con- f I
sidered that the country has received Mil
already, since the beginning of the Ml I
war, a refugee population far exceed- Mi I
ing the combined citizenship of the If H
Scandinavian countries, while the re- ! Mb I
serve forces of the country have been Mil
taxed to the utmost to provide for j Mil
the wandering people whose homes j III
have fallen within enemy lines and : III
whose fallen of livelihood are either ' I
temporarily, or permanently, forfeited. j I I
The wretched condition of the ref- ( I I
ugees has been steadily Improved i I
through the systematic efforts of the I
Russian government, working through
the various refugee committee. These
committees, looking beyond tho imme- i
diate necessities, are succeeding in j H
distributing the migratory population
throughout the interior, encouraging i
their colonization in fertile agricultur-
al districts and giving them work in
making boots, also clothing and other 1
immediately marketable articles. A
great number of theso refugee prod- i
ucts are now in use by the military j
and civil population. Special schools J 1
have been organized In many parts of 1
the country for refugee children and I
every means taken to prevent the war j 1
victims from becoming a burden to , 1
the state.
American Committee Active. J 1
The American committee, headed
by Thomas W. Whitmore, working in H
conjunction with the Tatiana commit- , WM
tee, organized by the empress, has WM
made valuable contributions to the j !
relief work and is now devoting its ,
energies to meeting the Rumanian HI
problem. Temporary barracks and a jH
number of food kitchens have been
established at all distributing centers IH
to receive tho Incoming Rumanians.
From these places the Rumanians will
be sent to tho interior. Despite all
efforts, however, the enormity of the
task has defeated all efforts to ade
quately handle tho gigantic migration
or people brought about by the war.
The refugee ranks have been inevita
bly thinned by disease and many have
fallen victims to cold, lack of proper
food and clothing and the unsanitary
conditions which are bound .to accom
pany the sudden unloading of a vast
additional population on a country at
