The Dally Mall, under the caption,

"What we hnvoMiad to fear mo.t

The Chronicle remarks:
'Tho prime minister' drnmatlc an

"In a matter of this gravity there Is

subjected by Commissioner Kutc and
Corporation Counsel Conrad Hmyn be

Mr. Palmer failed to see how fran
chises that cost them nothing should
be Included In the valuation figures
of the company. He' made a very
clear statement In his recommenda

Chicago and on his report the rates
for the city were fixed. He admitted
this when questioned by Mr. Hynie.
In his direct examination yesterday
Mr. Palmer stated that hr thought-;

of the value of the plant.

The witness said he thought there

HAVE YOU AIDED
THOSE IN NEED?
If You Haven't, Mr. Big Brother,
', Here Are Some Queries
For YOU.
COME, BE 'A GOOD FELLOW
Then You'll Enjoy Christmas
Fully, and You'll Have
a Right To.
Have YOU, Mr. Rig Drolher, ever sat
Ir! front of a little kitchen atove, the
only source of heat in a tumbledown
wlldswept shack, and tried to drive
away th racking chill that comes of
low vitality the gaunt brother of
hunger?
Have YOU?
Have YOU ever tried to sleep at
night, beneath coverings that failed to
keep off the cold that penetrates to
your very bones?
If you have, you are one of those
who are digging deeply Into their
store of savings for the benefit of
their unfortunate brothers. You are
one of those humans whose Christmas
will be gladdened by the Joy of an op
portunity grasped by the wholesome
feeling of having helped a fellow-mortal.
And If you have not. It Is all the
more a duty, and a golden opportunity
for YOU to give of your store to help
along some one whose sufferings you
cannot even Imagine.
What are your babies going to have
for Christmas?
Stockings filled to the brim with
sweets and toys piping hot Christ
mas turkey, a nice, warm home,
whero they may roll and gurgle and
kick their heels on the soft carpets.
And when YOU sit down to VOl'll
holiday feast whet about the under
fed, anemic youngsters who live al
most within the shadow of your
gates?
When YOUR wife decks herself In
her silken togs and smiles over the
turkey at you and the children how
about Hie poor little widowed mother,
with a hungry brood of four or Hve7
Maybo she lives but a square nwoy

Call you sen her efforts to smile
as she tries to feed her family?
Can ou see a clrule of wide eyes,
watching eagerly for their shale of

mush, perhaps, or a barren looking
soup bone?
How about It. Mr. Rig Riother?
Have you donated your share of the
obligation i every able-bodied, solv
ent citizen to the Associated Chari

portunities left to help make Christ

House Knocks Out Some of the
Recommendations for Dis
trict Increases.
$1,800 MEN WILL BENEFIT
All Getting That Wuch or Loss
Practically Asuurod of
Biggor Wages.
Although it Is practically assured
that District employes receiving less
than 11,600 u year will bo voted i
general salary Increase, the Houso to
day overturned somo of the legisla
tive recommendations presented by
the Appropriations Committee In th
District appropriation bill.
At tho very outset of the debnte a
point o fordcr was, sustained against
the 11,000 Increase In the salary of
the three Commissioners. ,
Points of Order.
In quick succession, points or oidei
woro also upheld agn.nst legislative
rldora for the creation of u lleenst
bureau and changing existing law r
latlng to tho tax assessor's office.
Congressman Cox of Indiana modi
thn point of order against tho Com
mlssloncr's salaries, and Mr. Mann
knocked out the two Inglalatlvt
rldora.
Following out his policies of raising
points of order against all Icglslativt
riders In the bill, Mr. Mann cllmlnaTed
a provision requiring a statement of
"true consideration" In all deeds fllsd
In the District of Columbia.
Knoeks Out Another Plan.
Mr. Mann also knocked out tho leg
islative provision that hereafter re
jection by tho Senate of the nomina
tion of any member of tho Hxcls
Roard shull automatically, teriulnnl ,
his employment.
Tho legislation affecting the Tax
Assessnia' Offlen was particularly de
sired by the District Commissioners.
It provided, In brief, that thn Com
missioners shall havo all powers o
removal of tho Assessor ahd his as
slstants, that hereafter records und
accounts relating to tho collection ol
taxea shall be made out In tho Tax
Collector's office Instead of the Tax
Assessor's office, und that n special
license bureau, rather than the As
sessor, shall have Jurisdiction over nil
Dlstilct licenses.
All Kllnalnated.
All or this legislation was elimi
nated, and the only hope now la that
It will be referred by the Senate and
retained in conference.
Without a nil to make thn legis
lation In order. It sema likely thli
afternoon that all legislative riders
In the bill would bo killed by points
or order.
Point or Order.
As soon as the reading of iho Dl
trlct bill waa begun a point or ordei
was made against the proposition U
Increase the salaries of the Commla
slonera rrom 5.000 to $0,000. -Congressman
Cox or Indiana, a Demo
crat, made tho point of order and do
cllncd to withdraw It following nt
animated debato ns to the worth oi
the services rendered by the Com,
mlssloners.
When tho point or order waa sua
tatned, Congressman Page( In charg .
or the bill, offered an amendment to
storing the lower salary as provider
by existing law. ,
It Is possible, however, that tin
Senate will grant tho 10,000 salary)
and It will bo accepted in conference
byitho House conferees. This Is qultt
likely as most of the members of th
Appropriation Committee think tin
Commissioners salaries ought to b
raised.
Criticism lly Moan.
Congressman Mann, the minority
leader, was ono of those who criti
cized the Commissioners' estimate!
for higher salaries for themselves. He
alto Indicated u belief that tho Com.
mlsslouers do not "stap on tho Jon
ns they should."
"Did the Commissioners ask fo'r thla
raiser' asked Mr, Mann.
"The estimates carried n. recom
mendation for nn Incicase to ,17.500,"
icplled Mr. Page.
"Then the Commissioners asked fat
a CO per cent inlso for themselves,"
said Mr. Mann. "Did they ask thai
much for anybody else!"
"They usked for numerous Increase
in the bill." said Mr. Page. "They
did nut ask. for a 60 per cent Increas
on the whnle;h of course not."
No One Raise of Wise.
"Did anybody else come In for a U
per cent Increuso in tho estimates ex.
cept the Commissioners?" persisted Mr,
Mann.
"No, I thing not," said Congressman
Page.
"Mio chai women for Instanco?"
"No, but there aro increases pro.
posed for charwomen and numeroui
oher einplojes,"
a Demooiutlc member of the Apprnprlu.
Congressman William Schley Howard,
tlou Coinmlltoo, defended tho proposer)
incicase.
"Tlicio aie no three men In Iho DIs.
trlct who work harder than, these Com
missioners," said Mr. Howard. "They
are men who relied si eat cicdlt upon
the appointive powei and Iho cltlzeni
of the DUtiiet mo' appreciative, of Iheli
efforts. I beliuvo they work hardei
than nn ho.ud of i ommbulonera with.
