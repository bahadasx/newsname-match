UNABLE TO ESTIMATE
THE EFFECT
Officials at Washington are Much
Concerned Over Lloyd-George's
Announcement
(Associated Press)
Washington, Dec. 20. Officials here
regard with concern the questions
raised by Premier Lloyd-George's an
nouncement that all British hipping
will be taken into the national service.
Officials believed at first glane it
would turn over a majority of the
world's shipping to specific war pur
poses. The effect on American com
merce is problematical. It is thought
the effect on the submarine situation
would be to remove the confusion be
tween public vessels not ' entitled to
guarantees and private ships entitled
to warning. V

HIGH COST OF LIVING
Important Subject Discussed at a
Committee Meeting at the
Woman's Club
A committee of the Woman's Club
together with representatives from
other women's organizations and sev
eral of the merchants of the city met
at the Woman's Club building Mon
day afternoon to discuss the question
of the day, "the high cost of. living."
Women's clubs and neighborhood
groups of women all over the country
are having called meetings for the
purpose, of discussing this very im
portant question and in many places
they have succeeded in reducing the
prices of certain articles of food. But
this has been in larger places where
certain articles have been "cornered,"
and the reduction has been brought
about 'by a boycott. It was not the
purpose . of this committee, however,
to recommend this method since the
committee fully realized that a local
boycott in a small community could
not effect prices except on local pro-
duce and it was thejr object to work!
for the interest of local producers,
our farmers, poultry and milk men
as much as for the merchants and
jnsumers of Ocala.
Messrs. B. A. Weathers, Baxter
Cam, Harvey Clark and T. C. Carter
responded to the invitation to meet
with the committee ,and others pres
ent were Mrs. C. Rhcinauer, repre
senting the King's Daughters; Mrs.
D. E. Mclver, representing the U. D.
C; Mrs. F. G. B. Weihe, the Eastern
Stars; Mrs. R. L. Anderson of the
club, and also representing the Pres
byterian ladies; Mrs. R. S. Hall, the
Baptist ladies; Mrs. G. ,T. Maughs,
the Episcopalians; Mrs. L. J. Knight,
the Catholics; . Mrs. W. T. Gary, the
club and the W. C. T. U.; Miss Ella
Mendenhall, the Parent-Teachers' as
sociation, and Mrs.'Hocker and Mrs.
Tydings of the Woman's Club.
All of the gentlemen present made
splendid talks and threw a great deal
of light on the subject. Mr. Weath
ers of the H. B. Masters Co., made the
first talk. He said the condition of
affairs was as much concern to the
merchants as to the public and that
they are glad to co-operate with the
consumers wherever " possible. He
thought the condition brought on by
the war is of course responsible for
the high prices, although speculation
has something to do with it, too.
Mr. Carn spoke most optimistically
of present conditions and feels that
the present high prices is the best
thing that has happened in years, and
feels 'that there are brighter times
ahead for Marion county than ever
before in history. If we will only
have a little patience he thinks that
conditions will soon adjust themselves.
Mr. Harvey Clark of the O. K. Tea
pot Grocery thought that the women
can largely solve the problem con
fronting them by studying economy
and by doing their own marketing. He
thought that a boycott of the necessi
ties of life would result in more harm
than good. That it would discourage
the raisers of nroduce and would
eventually prove most disastrous.
Speaking of eggs, Mr. Weathers
stated that the Ocala market is almost
entirely furnished by the farmers in
this section.
Mr. Carter stated that the present
high price of flour is due to the short
age in the wheat crop and to specu
lation.
The general conclusions reached
were that the high prices existing to
day are due to supply and demand and
to a certain extent to speculation.
The shortage in the grain crops
last year has raised the price of flour
and feed. The high price of flour and
feed has raised the price of bread,
i chickens, eggs, milk, etc.
The higher price of tin and wrap
ping for cans, together with a short
crop of tomatoes and other vegetables
has raised the price of canned goods.
Considering then the decreased pro
duction this year and the greater de-
Imand on account of the war and the
cheapness of money in the north on
account of the great influx of gold, it
is easy to see why prices are high.
The only condition which can be rem
edied is that of the rise of prices on
account of speculation and the U. S.

government is now carrying on an in
vestigation in this direction.
Certain other articles, of course,
are high on account of being imported
articles with the production or manu
facture of which the war has inter
fered. Currants, for instance, are
largely imported and consequently
Christmas fruit cake comes -high this
year.
Mr. Clark and many of the women
present urged greater economy, and
Mrs. Anderson read a splendid article
on this subject wrhich she had prepar
ed. Attention was called to the fact
that even with the high cost of feed,
our farmers are giving us eggs at 40
and 45 cents, while in other parts of
the state they have run as high as 75
cents. This shows the great advant
age we have in living in a farming
community.
. Mr. Weathers stated that conditions
in our county are much improved over
what they were one year ago and with
Mr. Carn believes that we are at the
dawn of a much brighter day.
Mrs. Tydings "reported that the
King's Daughters have only eleven
baskets to distribute this year as
against twenty-four last year, show
ing that conditions are improving.
The committee discussed the advis
ability of holding a mass meeting at
a later date. Each representative pres
ent will take to her organization a re
port of this committee meeting and it
will be discussed among them, and it
is t hoped that good will result from
this meeting, and if it is thought ad
visable a mass meeting will be held at
a later date.
It was also suggested that later on
some- noted authority on political
economy would be asked to address
the Woman's Club at an open meet
