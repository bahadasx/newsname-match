House in Benson, and the question up
for discussion was, "Resolved, That
Immigration into the United States
Should be Further Restricted by
Means of a Literary-Test" Willmar

of the argument, and so cleverly were
their points driven home, and so good
was their delivery, the decision of the
judges was unanimous in their favor.
The judges were Judge George W
Beise of Morris, Supt O Reinhold
of Murdock, and Prof. Miller of the
Morris Agricultural school.
